00:01.200 --> 00:11.140
Okay. I remember at the end of the last interview, you told us in pretty much
detail what the voyage from yesteryear was about. Did I? Yeah, we have material

00:11.140 --> 00:19.280
on that already. I think you were just finishing it up. Okay. First of all, I
noticed in Locust that you received a Prometheus award for the voyage from

00:19.280 --> 00:31.000
yesteryear. And I wondered what that award was. Is this me? I wondered what that
award consisted of, what it was given for. it's given by the libertarian party

00:31.000 --> 00:52.680
every year for the fictional novel which they believe best depicts the ideals
and values that their party stands for that's about all I know right I think

00:52.680 --> 01:06.500
they're pretty much strongly for individual freedom and the individual
responsibility that goes with it and the minimum government intervention in

01:06.500 --> 01:12.140
business and in the life of the private individual that's consistent with

01:14.700 --> 01:27.240
a secure and insanely functioning society In other words, the award is not just
for a science fiction novel, yours just happened to be one. I believe so. Yeah,

01:27.380 --> 01:31.100
okay. Okay, is this word pronounced Qironians or Qironians?

01:34.180 --> 01:46.200
I pronounce it Qironians, but I couldn't really say Qironians is wrong.
Different people have different customs. Sometimes, I remember when we did Latin

01:46.200 --> 01:54.900
at school, the pronunciation of certain Latin verbs depended on which school he
went to. I think it's pretty much the same with this. I pronounce it Chironians.

01:56.040 --> 02:06.940
Okay, my question would be, to the Chironians, they desired physical contact
with Earthmen, I guess seemingly to connect with their roots. And I wondered, do

02:06.940 --> 02:20.400
you think it's possible, therefore, to construct a machine-ray society off
Earth? Will our genes allow it? I don't see why not. The fact that I had them

02:20.400 --> 02:32.080
behaving that way, it's not necessarily a prophecy or a prediction or a
statement of anything that's inevitable. It was just a trait that made them more

02:32.080 --> 02:41.800
interesting as thinking-feeling beings and gave an underlying motivation for a
lot of their actions. So it was purely arbitrary to help but to tie the plot

02:41.800 --> 02:51.320
together. it wasn't a prediction based on anything i know that's true of us okay
this is a picky question i'm not even sure this would go in the final interview

02:51.320 --> 03:01.140
but i was i was concerned in the uh it was fairly early in the book when the uh
the two the tyronians and the earthmen are there they're blending they're

03:01.140 --> 03:11.720
getting together and uh there was a bar scene where the killing occurred okay
okay and the tyronian woman was being molested she pulled out a pistol and shot

03:11.720 --> 03:18.880
the guy on the leg then there was an altercation and one of the earthmen was
killed it seemed a little strange to me given their society that they were

03:18.880 --> 03:29.620
carrying guns right well and i realize they have that huge weapon and they're
pretty they're well able to take care of themselves but i wouldn't have thought

03:29.620 --> 03:37.600
that they would need those guns against each other were they carrying them just
specifically because earthmen were around i think that was explained it said it

03:37.600 --> 03:47.240
was a habit that It went back several generations, but they carried them against
each other. There was some talks in another part of the book.

03:53.440 --> 04:07.700
Their personalities as individuals, they are the result of the same dealing out
and mixing of human gene sets as the rest of us. They're not in any way a super

04:07.700 --> 04:19.680
race. They don't all have an IQ. They aren't all ethically and morally superior
and rational in their behavior. In other words, I wasn't really trying to depict

04:19.680 --> 04:29.080
a utopia. I don't really like stories about utopia. I think they're hideously
boring places to read about. And yeah, because of the accident, well, not really

04:29.080 --> 04:42.080
the accident, because of the circumstances circumstances surrounding their
origins and the isolation of their society from the way many of the problems of

04:42.080 --> 04:54.480
our society are passed on through the ages. It so happened that many of the
things that we would regard as problems had been solved or at least ceased to be

04:54.480 --> 05:03.640
problems, but I wasn't trying to suggest it was some utopia. and everybody
always acted rational and everybody always acted compassionately and

05:03.640 --> 05:12.800
sympathetically and did the good thing. And I think that's kind of a cop-out,
right, is sometimes trying to depict these advanced societies and you say, well,

05:13.200 --> 05:21.820
how do you solve the problem about the drunk next to you in the bar who insists
on starting a fight or somebody who's trying to... You know, people who insist

05:21.820 --> 05:29.340
on being obnoxious and bothering other people and they get around having to
solve the problem by never having people act that way. well that's unrealistic

05:29.340 --> 05:39.560
people are going to act that way and in their society they just defended
themselves against such eventualities because there was no traditional law or

05:39.560 --> 05:49.740
authority to tell them they shouldn't and i guess by the time the earth people
showed up it was you know being accustomed that it's like wearing a hat or a

05:49.740 --> 05:59.420
pair of boots that have been handed down although i think your point is probably
a very good one it could be that with with the of people around in their ways,

06:00.140 --> 06:08.000
quite a number of people who's left their gut at home for the last few years and
just used it as a souvenir might take it out or worry it and carry it around

06:08.000 --> 06:17.020
again just in case. I think that's very likely spot people while I didn't
specifically say so in the book. Okay, that's good. Okay, let me skip to the

06:17.020 --> 06:24.780
Code of the Life Maker. Okay. Of course, there you return or you continue with
one of the themes that I think you pursue in much of your fiction, intelligent

06:24.780 --> 06:33.100
machines or so forth. I guess, Now, this is almost a rhetorical question, so I
don't think I know the answer to it, but one of your contentions in the novel is

06:33.100 --> 06:45.820
that machines or manufactured artifacts can have life which is just as valid as
human life, right? Sure. Okay, now, we normally think of machines as free from

06:45.820 --> 06:54.560
human prejudices and emotional weaknesses and so forth. Yet you give the
talloids normal human shortcomings in religion and mysticism and so forth. I

06:54.560 --> 07:14.160
wondered why you did that. I would- I don't think the fact that those traits
exist in us, I would suggest, isn't a consequence of our intelligence being

07:14.160 --> 07:27.980
supported by carbon chemistry hardware. it's a consequence of our intelligence
and our human characteristics including our aggressiveness, our jealousies and a

07:27.980 --> 07:41.680
lot of the things that can cause problems in the relatively secure environment
of a civilized culture having originated in a competitive survival-based

07:41.680 --> 07:52.380
evolutionary environment it was the way in which we evolved

07:52.380 --> 08:05.440
as beings that determined those traits it had nothing to do with the hardware
that our mental processes happen to be supported by in the case of the taloids

08:05.440 --> 08:18.320
they, because of the beginnings that they come from which were described in the
prologue They had evolved competitively in a survival-oriented fashion in

08:18.320 --> 08:29.340
exactly the same way as we had. I think my suggestion, and I think it's quite a
fairly valid one, is that they would have evolved similar traits and strengths

08:29.340 --> 08:41.240
and weaknesses, belief systems, exactly the way we did because they had evolved
them to serve exactly the same purposes. the fact that their faculties were

08:41.240 --> 08:51.860
supported on electronic hardware and ours was supported on carbon chemistry
hardware, to my mind, is completely immaterial. In other words, I guess that

08:51.860 --> 08:58.800
actually giving them those kinds of human traits is sort of reinforcing the
notion that there doesn't have to be any essential difference between carbon

08:58.800 --> 09:11.460
-based and machine life. Exactly. I mean, the faculty that we call thinking is a
very complex function of the nervous system that's evolved over millions of

09:11.460 --> 09:22.400
years, but I suggest it's an emergent property of the level of complexity and
the way in which that complexity is organized at the highest level of the human

09:22.400 --> 09:31.700
brain. It's nothing to do with the fact that down at the bottom level of the
hardware we happen to be talking about mechanical neurons instead of mechanical

09:31.700 --> 09:32.700
electronic chips,

09:37.000 --> 09:48.220
yeah, your point is right. It doesn't make a lot of difference. To try and
demystify the whole topic, I would reverse the normal way the question is asked

09:48.220 --> 09:53.720
and say, as is

09:53.720 --> 10:05.320
demonstrably obvious, if a system exists that's capable of supporting all of the
operations we normally refer to in everyday speech when we use the word

10:05.320 --> 10:20.040
thinking. And that system happens to have come from naturally evolved origins.
Is there any reason to suppose that a system of comparable complexity in

10:20.040 --> 10:30.180
organization that happens to have come from some other origins shouldn't be
capable of doing likewise? My answer is there's no reason to suppose that that's

10:30.180 --> 10:43.960
true. Another part of it, of course, was kind of a little writer's license, in
that here we have these machines and their culture. Obviously, they were very

10:43.960 --> 10:52.680
human-like in some of their emotions and some of the ways they had evolved. That
was quite deliberate, of course, to enable the reader to relate more closely to

10:52.680 --> 11:03.260
them. If we made them totally alien and maybe building totally different
representations of world models and self-images, it could be very clever. but

11:03.260 --> 11:11.880
you'd lose most readers completely. They'd just say, well, it was describing
some alien set of concepts. I couldn't understand it. So I kind of deliberately

11:11.880 --> 11:20.520
bet that way a little because it is fiction after all, and the object is to
entertain human beings whether or not it's about machines. Okay, one of the

11:20.520 --> 11:31.020
things I appreciated about the novel, I enjoyed it and I agree with it, was to
me it had a pretty sharp satiric edge to it. As a small example, little touches.

11:31.020 --> 11:41.160
One of the talloids, I think his name was Gruerk, he enters a city on a steam
donkey preaching words of faith from the life maker. I wondered if you were just

11:41.160 --> 11:46.080
having fun with something like that or are you seriously tearing something down?
Obviously having fun.

11:52.840 --> 12:02.520
Some of these are rhetorical. I think I know the answers. Why Zambendorf is one
of the protagonists? he's a con man who operates with alleged mystical powers

12:02.520 --> 12:04.900
and so forth something that you must personally detest.

12:07.520 --> 12:16.900
What's the question? Well, why do you make him one of the protagonists? You
know, that we see much of what's happening through his eyes. I didn't. When I

12:16.900 --> 12:33.480
started to write this book the original protagonist was Joey Massey the
psychologist and the conjurer. Okay? And Jerry Massey was originally supposed to

12:33.480 --> 12:43.500
be the protagonist, and I had 20 chapters of the book written, and it wasn't
working, so I tore them all up and started all over again. The reason it wasn't

12:43.500 --> 12:54.560
working, what happens when you start to write a novel? One of the signs that
it's going right, sometimes I go to science fiction conventions and I sit on

12:54.560 --> 13:08.400
panels, and the panels are very frequently on scientific subjects and the kinds
of things that are speculated about in science fiction. But also, sorry,

13:08.480 --> 13:17.800
I just tried to swat a fly that's bothering me. Some of them are on writing
itself, you know, being a writer and how to sell you stuff and things like that.

13:18.360 --> 13:29.400
I'm less comfortable on those panels because I'm not sure of the value of all
this advice that professionals throw out and would-be writers, you know,

13:29.900 --> 13:32.700
reverently absorb and note down. I think a lot of it is luck.

13:35.820 --> 13:45.920
But so many of these things are just gut feel. One of the arts of writing a
book, I guess, is knowing where to draw the line of where do you stop fiddling

13:45.920 --> 13:56.480
around with it and mail it off to the editor. nothing in nature is linear and
one of the most universal non-linear functions is the law of diminishing returns

13:57.260 --> 14:07.720
and as you put more and more effort into a book the increment, the extra
improvement that you buy for your time gets less and less and you can fiddle

14:07.720 --> 14:18.180
around trying to get something perfect and starve to death in the meantime at
the other end you can take far too little care and mail off a half-baked set of

14:18.180 --> 14:27.500
ideas that don't stand to hope in hell of getting sold by, at least not to any
decent publisher. But somewhere between the two, there's this optimum level, and

14:27.500 --> 14:37.160
all I can say is gut feel. I don't know of any list of conditions you can check
off and say, you know, check the boxes, and then it's ready to send. And when it

14:37.160 --> 14:45.900
comes to characters, one of the feel, things that the gut feels that you get
when you know the book is going right is when the characters kind of come to

14:45.900 --> 14:55.920
life in your mind and start to take over the story and they start to do things
their way. And it means that they are acquiring real personalities themselves

14:56.340 --> 15:05.520
and they're doing the things you know they would do. And you say, how do you
know so-and-so would do that? Well, I just know him. And it's like the person

15:05.520 --> 15:12.440
you've sat next to in the office for the last three years. Somebody cracks a
joke and you say, hey, Harry would love that. You know Harry, you know the way

15:12.440 --> 15:26.000
he thinks. And it got to about 20 chapters and the characters were just, Massey
was just not working. He was not doing anything. He was wandering around as a

15:26.000 --> 15:37.880
passive observer and listener. He was watching what other people were doing and
listening to what other people were saying. So he was just a roving observer

15:37.880 --> 15:51.960
acting on behalf of the reader. And it's just not satisfying. It didn't feel
right. And one of the... When you've decided on a setting for a story to write

15:51.960 --> 16:05.160
about, how do you decide who's going to be the protagonist anyway? One good
principle to follow is that... to ask who is most affected by the outcome of the

16:05.160 --> 16:18.960
story or who most drives the story. whose actions are most responsible for the
story coming out the way it is. And if somebody clearly stands out in that role,

16:19.000 --> 16:28.440
that's a good candidate for the protagonist. And after 20 chapters, it was
pretty obvious it wasn't massive. And yet it just seemed to be Zabendorf. And I

16:28.440 --> 16:42.420
suppose interesting stories to write about are periods in an individual's life
where the person is changed. Their outlook on life has changed, their values

16:42.420 --> 16:51.360
have changed. They come out of the story visibly different in ways from when
they went in. Well, that's probably an interesting period in their life to write

16:51.360 --> 17:03.140
about, and they're the obvious protagonist for that particular story, and that's
the way it worked out in this case. And whether I happen to have a lot of time

17:03.140 --> 17:14.940
for ESP and so-called paranormal phenomena is beside the point. um and you know
why in any case why should that um disqualify the character from being my

17:14.940 --> 17:22.620
protagonist if i happen not to agree with him i mean plenty of people like old
frederick foresight in the day of the jackal and a lot of books we could name it

17:22.620 --> 17:33.280
uh their their hero the protagonist is maybe a murderer or an assassin that
certainly doesn't mean that the the author of the book is advocating murder or

17:33.280 --> 17:45.140
assassin as a past time, or assassination is a past time. Okay, good. I've only
got one more major question, and that would involve, oh, let's say, works in

17:45.140 --> 17:54.920
progress, books coming out in the near future. Could you give me a little
statement on that? Yeah, about halfway through the next book, it's different

17:54.920 --> 18:03.720
from the others, but they're all different from each other. I don't think any of
them have variations on the same theme. I mean, we've had one on intelligence

18:03.720 --> 18:18.040
computers and one on time travel and one on aliens and so forth, and this one is
on... We haven't had an alternate universe story yet, so that's what this one

18:18.040 --> 18:28.800
is, and it gets mixed up with World War II. Most of it takes place between the
beginning of 1939 and the end of 1942. And the characters include Franklin

18:28.800 --> 18:35.540
Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, a
whole list of names like that.

18:38.320 --> 18:48.800
Oh, is it the kind of thing we ought to talk too much about in advance? Probably
not, I guess. Let's just say that the

18:48.800 --> 19:00.100
official version has it that the Manhattan Project dealt with developing the
fission bomb and Einstein's ladder years were spent wrestling with an unsolved

19:00.100 --> 19:10.480
problem in unified field theory. Well, both those stories are true as far as
they went, as far as they go. However, there was a little more to it than that,

19:10.600 --> 19:22.340
which is what this book goes into. Okay, good. I don't suppose it has any title
yet, then? No, it doesn't. No, the titles are always the last thing I put on the

19:22.340 --> 19:35.980
book. I just have a working label in the meantime that I simply use to refer to
the book, and at the moment it's just a computer file name. Okay. We had a very

19:35.980 --> 19:43.760
good interview with you before, so really as short as this is, that will be
sufficient. Is there anything else you'd like to add or bring up or have put in

19:43.760 --> 19:54.020
the book or anything like that? No, nothing that comes readily to mind, but if
he finds you have further questions, feel free to give me a call. Okay, that's

19:54.020 --> 20:02.020
good. Listen, we are regular attendees at the Aggie Con, which we understand
you're going to be at next year. Yep, that's how they tell me. So we will be

20:02.020 --> 20:07.920
there to meet you finally. I look forward to that. Yeah, we'll look forward to
it. And listen, of course, we'll send you a copy of this book when it's

20:07.920 --> 20:16.220
published. It's going to be probably at least a year. Okay, well, that's what I
expect. I know these things don't happen overnight. Yeah, and later on, when we

20:16.220 --> 20:24.400
get the manuscript transcribed, of course, we're having typists transcribe the
interviews. And when you get everything ready, introductions, written, and so

20:24.400 --> 20:30.400
forth, we'll maybe get back in touch with you and see if you have an extra
picture. Oh, you did already send it, didn't you? I haven't sent it yet. Oh,

20:30.440 --> 20:37.080
that's right, okay. Yeah, so when we're... I've been down for the last two
weeks. I've only just got back, so... Yeah. Well, yeah, in the future, when we

20:37.080 --> 20:43.440
need it, we'll go ahead and send you a stamped envelope or something. Okay. If
you wouldn't be a bother, you could send us one. I'd appreciate that. Yeah. I'll

20:43.440 --> 20:50.240
get a photograph off to you today or tomorrow. Okay, then thank you, Mr. Hooker.
We sure appreciate your time. Okay, appreciate your interest. Okay, take care.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.580
Thank you. Bye. Bye now.
