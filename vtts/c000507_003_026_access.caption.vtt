Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.080
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.540
And here are your hosts.

00:43.940 --> 00:51.640
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. British-born author James P. Hogan has
gained a reputation as one of the premier writers of hard science fiction

00:51.640 --> 01:01.400
working today. He's published seven novels so far, including Inherit the Stars,
The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, Giant Star, Thrice Upon a Time, The Two Faces of

01:01.400 --> 01:13.980
Tomorrow, and his latest, Voyage from Yesteryear. Hogan tells us how he became
an author. When I left school when I was 16 and wanted to be a writer then, I

01:13.980 --> 01:26.060
guess it was something that I always enjoyed doing as a kid at school. You know,
the essays and the story writing exercises you get. And when I left school, I

01:26.060 --> 01:38.520
told the world I was going to be a writer. And it seemed a good idea until
somebody said, well, with all the accumulated wisdom and experience of 16 years,

01:38.700 --> 01:47.900
what are you going to write about that the world is breathlessly waiting to
hear? And I hadn't thought about that, and the answer was not a lot. So I went

01:47.900 --> 02:01.080
away into engineering and electronics and computers and things like that for
something like 20 years. And I suppose the interest in writing probably never

02:01.080 --> 02:10.120
went away. For 20 years, Hogan worked as a systems designer for computers, and
sold computers to scientists for use in their research. Associating with

02:10.120 --> 02:17.360
scientists as he did, Hogan was exposed to all sorts of current scientific
research, and he would make use of his scientific contacts when he began to

02:17.360 --> 02:29.320
write seriously. I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants, which
was kind of handy. I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and

02:29.320 --> 02:40.160
other customers who studied pieces of rock brought back from the Apollo
missions, and other guys who were investigating machine intelligence. And just

02:40.160 --> 02:51.920
about any of the topics or the favorite themes of science fiction that you could
pick out of a hat, the chances were sort of not 10 to 1 I had a customer

02:51.920 --> 03:00.760
specializing in that field. And I just had to, if I needed some background
information on a particular topic, I could almost guarantee I had a phone number

03:00.760 --> 03:10.000
in my diary of a guy who could talk all day about it. And they loved doing it as
well, I used to call them, and if they'd like to come and talk to you tomorrow.

03:11.080 --> 03:18.860
Well, we're a little busy, but what's it about? Oh, I need some help with the
book I'm working on. Well, why didn't you say so? What time do you want to show

03:18.860 --> 03:27.440
up? And they talk all day. And I think this is one of the interesting

03:27.440 --> 03:42.500
sides of selling computers into this kind of area. You can imagine some of these
specialists, they talk to bacteria or whatever, and they end up shut in the back

03:42.500 --> 03:52.500
rooms of universities. And maybe there are four people on the planet they can
talk to who understand their language. And sometimes they find it hard to

03:52.500 --> 04:06.080
believe that somebody from the world outside that has walked in off the street
is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them. And he's curious. He wants

04:06.080 --> 04:16.720
to know what they're doing. He wants to have it explained. So, writing about his
experiences with scientists, Hogan found that he was a science fiction writer. I

04:16.720 --> 04:26.380
didn't particularly set out to be a science fiction writer. I suppose I became
one by accident. I just always wanted to write and started writing stories about

04:26.380 --> 04:35.720
the little bit of life that I'd had some personal experience of. And was told I
was a science fiction writer. And I said, how's that? And they said, well, the

04:35.720 --> 04:44.940
publisher is publishing it under their science fiction imprint. So, we guess you
have to be. So, I said, okay. And it kind of started out like that. Hogan's

04:44.940 --> 04:52.480
books are scientifically accurate and highly realistic. He's been called the man
who put science back into science fiction. Next time, we'll talk to James P.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.700
Hogan about some of his novels.

05:01.160 --> 05:09.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:09.240 --> 05:10.000
Odessa, Texas.

05:51.540 --> 05:55.500
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:11.580 --> 06:17.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.520
And here are your hosts.

06:25.820 --> 06:34.300
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. James P. Hogan's 1977 science fiction
novel, Inherit the Stars, should be required reading for anyone who demands

06:34.300 --> 06:42.340
scientific accuracy in an exciting narrative. The book takes place some 50 years
in the future. A skeleton inside a space suit is found on the moon. That's

06:42.340 --> 06:50.720
interesting enough, but what follows is even more provocative. The skeleton is a
human one, and it's been on the moon for 50,000 years. The scientific unraveling

06:50.720 --> 07:01.120
of this mystery forms the basis of the novel. It's like a detective story, and
Hogan talks about the origins of the idea. 2001 was one of the factors that

07:01.120 --> 07:13.460
inspired me to write Inherit the Stars. I love the idea of something being
found, a mystery being uncovered in the course of lunar exploration that was

07:13.460 --> 07:26.920
sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling it. It
seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to

07:26.920 --> 07:35.860
write. You know, okay, let's have the detective story or the mystery that the
detectives are trying to solve hinge around something that's turned up on the

07:35.860 --> 07:48.540
moon. Well, dead bodies are always pretty good for detective stories. It ought
to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective thriller, so

07:48.540 --> 07:58.980
let's make it 50,000 years old and human, which raises the whole, opens up the
whole bag of worms. And let's just see how they unravel that. And I wanted the

07:58.980 --> 08:03.260
ending to be a

08:03.260 --> 08:13.980
bit of a twist, a bit of a surprise, but nevertheless plausible and rational
within the context of the story. I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or

08:13.980 --> 08:18.920
strange

08:18.920 --> 08:28.800
laws of physics or anything like this to hold it together. The entire scientific
community of Earth starts to work on the baffling problem of the space-suited 50

08:28.800 --> 08:37.220
,000-year-old human skeleton, which they named Charlie. They soon find remnants
on the moon of Charlie's culture, a map of an unfamiliar planet, scraps of

08:37.220 --> 08:45.400
Charlie's diary in an unfamiliar language, and some technological artifacts.
With such clues, the scientists begin to piece together the incredible story of

08:45.400 --> 08:53.600
who Charlie was and why he was human. Hogan says the book sort of defines what
science is all about. It counters some of the distorted images of scientists

08:53.600 --> 09:02.560
Hogan has seen in fiction. Scientists were always eccentric, and they wore odd
-colored shoes, and they drew cabbages that ate people, and they wanted to

09:02.560 --> 09:14.880
conquer the world or something. And there were these cute public impressions of
scientists of people who run down the street with no clothes on shouting,

09:14.880 --> 09:15.400
Eureka!

09:25.320 --> 09:35.160
You read phrases like, it came to him in a flash, and you read on, and what came
to him in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20

09:35.160 --> 09:49.500
years. And real science, you know, there are insights. There are strokes of
genius. But the overwhelming bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes,

09:49.560 --> 10:00.740
a lot of people doing nothing really dramatic or exciting, but just meticulously
sifting through details and collecting information for generations and for

10:00.740 --> 10:10.400
centuries, all different parts of the world. And it's really like putting
together a huge jigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces and twisting

10:10.400 --> 10:18.220
them around. Every now and again, somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner
and see that it fits with a huge chunk down there, and that's a breakthrough.

10:18.540 --> 10:28.560
And so it goes on. And it really is a detective story. I think it's a far more
exciting one than most detective fiction. We strongly recommend you read Inherit

10:28.560 --> 10:36.280
the Stars to find out the solution to the mystery surrounding Charlie. Hogan
wrote two sequels to Inherit the Stars, and all three form a trilogy that

10:36.280 --> 10:41.160
presents an awesome view of man's origins. Next time, we'll talk with Hogan
about those other two books.

10:48.280 --> 10:56.320
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:56.320 --> 10:57.100
Odessa, Texas.

11:40.220 --> 11:44.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:00.380 --> 12:05.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.060
And here are your hosts.

12:14.980 --> 12:23.020
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. James P. Hogan's science fiction novel
Inherit the Stars was popular enough with readers to justify a sequel. Two of

12:23.020 --> 12:32.260
them, in fact. The first was entitled The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, and it was
published in 1978. Hogan explains why he wrote the book. When I wrote Inherit

12:32.260 --> 12:44.080
the Stars, I had three books in mind. I had a trilogy in mind. So I put the
hooks in... Although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself, you know,

12:44.080 --> 12:51.860
it didn't leave anything... It didn't leave the reader hanging. It told and...
It started and told and finished a story. Nevertheless, there were a couple of

12:51.860 --> 12:59.220
hooks in there that invited some questions, which sort of, as it were, paved the
way to a follow-up book.

13:01.920 --> 13:17.320
And my thinking at the time was, I'll go that far, but I won't write the second
book until I have some feedback as to how the readers liked the first one. And I

13:17.320 --> 13:24.460
got a lot of mail, and they all liked it. And a lot of them said in their
letters, will there be a follow-up? They picked out the hooks. So I wrote The

13:24.460 --> 13:32.940
Gentle Giants. The Gentle Giants of the title are a race of aliens that first
turned up and inherit the stars. In that book, scientists from Earth had

13:32.940 --> 13:40.980
discovered a wrecked spaceship on Ganymede, one of Jupiter's huge moons. And on
it were the remains of prehistoric creatures from Earth, dinosaurs and the like.

13:41.820 --> 13:48.980
In The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, humans meet some live Ganymeans who have
returned to the solar system after a mishap in space kept them away for some 25

13:48.980 --> 13:57.180
million years due to time dilation. It turns out that the Ganymeans had been
responsible for human evolution. They'd taken primitive hominids from Earth 25

13:57.180 --> 14:05.100
million years ago and moved them to a planet called Minerva. Minerva was then
one of the inner planets of our solar system, but it was destroyed in a

14:05.100 --> 14:12.820
tremendous war involving the human stock that had evolved from the Ganymean
experiments. The second book ends with the Ganymeans leaving the solar system

14:12.820 --> 14:20.000
in search of their own people, who migrated from Minerva millions of years
before the war that destroyed the planet. Hogan says readers wanted a third

14:20.000 --> 14:32.240
book. And they wanted another one. And I did have a trilogy in mind when I wrote
it. And the third one in that series is now written. It's called Giant Star. And

14:32.240 --> 14:43.880
it will be, it's a July title. So it should start to appear in the bookstores
around June. It's the third and last. There won't be any more in that series. It

14:43.880 --> 14:52.040
ties up a few of the loose ends, tells another story, continues

14:52.040 --> 15:03.040
with the characters we met in the previous two books, both the terrestrial and
the alien characters, and introduces some new ones. And I don't think there can

15:03.040 --> 15:06.900
be a fourth one, because it really, I don't think there's any more to be said.
It wraps it all up.

15:12.400 --> 15:20.020
Giant Star was published in 1981. And as Hogan said, it wraps up all the
mysteries and loose ends raised in the first two books. And it presents an

15:20.020 --> 15:28.740
absolutely breathtaking concept of man's origins, explaining also where man gets
his curious nature, his aggressiveness, and his incredible instinct for

15:28.740 --> 15:39.840
survival. Hogan talks about the underlying purpose of the whole trilogy.
Basically, it was an attempt to depict science as it is, or at least as I

15:39.840 --> 15:51.840
perceive it. And at the same time, weave that into a story that people who were
non-scientists, non-specialists, would find stimulating and arousing for the

15:51.840 --> 16:05.740
curiosity, even if, you know, without trying to turn it into a 250-page lab
report or something like that. And stimulating, the books certainly are. For

16:05.740 --> 16:13.540
sheer grandeur, the whole Minervan trilogy, as some have called it, is matched
by a few other works in the field of science fiction. Isaac Asimov's Foundation

16:13.540 --> 16:22.700
trilogy comes to mind as a comparison, as does Olaf Staplet and Zod John. James
P. Hogan's Inherit the Stars, The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, and Giant Star.

16:23.540 --> 16:26.160
Contemporary science fiction has little to offer that's any better.

16:33.440 --> 16:41.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:41.400 --> 16:42.180
Odessa, Texas.

17:24.780 --> 17:28.760
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:44.660 --> 17:50.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.440
And here are your hosts.

17:58.760 --> 18:06.880
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Time travel is one of the traditional
themes of science fiction. One of the best, certainly one of the most realistic

18:06.880 --> 18:15.480
time travel books, is James Hogan's Thrice Upon a Time, which came out in 1980.
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice Upon a

18:15.480 --> 18:27.520
Time, I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes,

18:27.660 --> 18:41.800
once and for all, and answer them without cop-outs, without convenient
coincidences, and without obliging characters who just happen to do the right

18:41.800 --> 18:44.980
thing to make everything come out the way the author said.

18:49.080 --> 19:00.360
And secondly, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche of some kind of a
conjurer's box, described or disguised as whatever, that you jump into and you

19:00.360 --> 19:11.540
jump out of and you're in some other time. We've seen too many conjurer's boxes,
and it seemed to me unrealistic. If I ever build a box like that, and I thought

19:11.540 --> 19:20.300
it was going to take me to another time, I certainly wouldn't jump into it and
press the button. I would conduct a long series of tests and experiments first,

19:20.380 --> 19:29.800
and none of our heroes ever seem to do this. Hogan wanted to avoid some of the
clichés or formulas that characterized most time travel stories. I think in too

19:29.800 --> 19:40.440
many stories, time machines are used like starships. They're just a device, a
vehicle, to get some characters into an unusual environment, and then tell a

19:40.440 --> 19:49.720
pretty routine story that was stolen from Greek mythology or European medieval
history. And the technology doesn't come into the story at all. They could have

19:49.720 --> 20:02.320
gone there on a Greyhound bus. I didn't want to do that. And so the story was
about some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon and had realized

20:02.320 --> 20:14.220
that if what they were seeing meant what they thought it meant, it meant that
they could actually inject information into the past and change the past, with

20:14.220 --> 20:15.500
all the questions that implies.

20:27.060 --> 20:35.100
The strange thing the physicists learn is that they can send messages into the
past, not far into the past, maybe just ten minutes. I didn't want it to be a

20:35.100 --> 20:45.600
million years or a billion years or some huge span of time where really nothing
that you did could make any difference. How about a lab bench experiment? Ten

20:45.600 --> 20:55.120
minutes. You can just send a little signal back to yourself ten minutes ago and
change what you've already done. This is interesting. You're hard up against the

20:55.120 --> 21:05.800
paradoxes now. You can't find a way around them or duck them. You've got to
answer the question, what happens? The logic of it, the whole situation becomes

21:05.800 --> 21:15.340
absolutely, it drives you to the point of insanity trying to figure it out. It
was the logic and the science implied by the time travel theme that fascinated

21:15.340 --> 21:23.040
Hogan. He wanted to approach the concept realistically. And it's so realistic
that you feel, after reading the book, you could go down to Radio Shack and buy

21:23.040 --> 21:31.100
the parts to make a time travel machine. Recently, a number of responsible
scientists have been speculating on the actual possibility of time travel. We

21:31.100 --> 21:40.020
asked Hogan if he thought it would ever be a reality and if his book was meant
to be prophetic. Well, I don't know whether it's prophetic or not. Well, as is

21:40.020 --> 21:50.660
elaborated in the book itself, if something like that ever became a fact, there
are some pretty interesting problems that are going to have to be solved. And

21:50.660 --> 22:00.960
our ideas of logic and cause and effect are going to have to undergo some pretty
interesting revisions. So, I'm certainly not setting myself up as a prophet and

22:00.960 --> 22:10.960
saying, yes, it'll happen. Maybe, I don't know. I think history has shown that
impossible or it'll never happen are very dangerous phrases to use in any

22:10.960 --> 22:14.120
context. More with James P. Hogan next time.

22:21.280 --> 22:29.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:29.300 --> 22:30.060
Odessa, Texas.

23:12.700 --> 23:16.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:32.740 --> 23:37.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.340
And here are your hosts.

23:46.620 --> 23:54.960
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Of all science fiction writers working
today, no one surpasses James P. Hogan in scientific accuracy and realism.

23:55.200 --> 24:02.500
Hogan's publisher, Ballantine Books, has advertised them as the man who put
science back in science fiction. And after reading books like Thrice Upon a Time

24:02.500 --> 24:09.620
and The Two Faces of Tomorrow, you realize how much he deserves that
description. Hogan is also concerned with realism, with the kind of everyday

24:09.620 --> 24:17.320
detail it makes his story, even though it's set in the future, a totally
believable one. He explains why realistic detail is important. I think these

24:17.320 --> 24:34.300
kinds of details do matter because if we're putting a story into a futuristic
setting, I think the little details of background, such as if the guy needs to

24:34.300 --> 24:44.600
make a phone tour, how does he go about it if he needs to rent a cab, these
matter because if the story is being told in the future, the whole of the

24:44.600 --> 24:47.340
background has to be consistently futuristic.

24:49.880 --> 25:03.980
I've come across a number of instances which, in my opinion, are a little flawed
because, spelt with an A-W, that a writer may have seized on a particular

25:03.980 --> 25:15.360
thought, maybe a new scientific idea or a machine or whatever, develops that
very well, but kind of gets hung up on it. And in the background, everything

25:15.360 --> 25:18.200
else that's going on hasn't changed since 1980.

25:22.080 --> 25:29.700
And trying to, I think, just stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to
think about a situation. The guy's going to make a phone call, just like stop

25:29.700 --> 25:43.860
and think how he might make that. And think about it for five minutes and then
maybe show it in a way different to what would have been the impulsive thing to

25:43.860 --> 25:45.300
do in the first couple of seconds.

25:54.160 --> 26:01.560
Hogan says that his readers appreciate his attention to realistic detail and
accuracy. In fact, he thinks he attracts some readers who don't normally read

26:01.560 --> 26:14.600
science fiction because of it. From the people who write to me and the people
that I meet, one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I

26:14.600 --> 26:26.260
have is that it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science
fiction reader who buys anything new that appears on the science fiction section

26:26.260 --> 26:38.120
of the bookstores. But a lot of, I suppose, people who might be termed younger
professional people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s, in all manner of professions,

26:38.160 --> 26:50.160
not necessarily to do with the sciences, teachers, lawyers, doctors, so forth,
who typically would say, gee, I used to read science fiction when I was at

26:50.160 --> 27:00.220
college or when I was at university, but I kind of grew out of it. I can't
relate to way out galaxies like years away anymore or aliens running around with

27:00.220 --> 27:12.360
ray guns. Today I have a family, a career, a mortgage, my feet are solidly on
the surface of this planet. But they seem to like stories that don't kind of try

27:12.360 --> 27:20.120
and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now, but
maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years. And they find names in the book

27:20.120 --> 27:31.600
like IBM and Avis and Boeing, familiar places. And it kind of grabs them. I say,
well, you know, this I can relate to. It's the world that I live in just

27:31.600 --> 27:39.380
stretched a little bit. The connection is not broken. The economics and the
politics have evolved from what I read in the papers. I can still see the

27:39.380 --> 27:48.520
connections. And it could be the world my kids grow up in. And I like it.
Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from Yesteryear, is further in the future than his

27:48.520 --> 27:55.920
other books. And the field of action is much broader. But it's typically Hogan
in his credibility. If you haven't been exposed to James P. Hogan's brand of

27:55.920 --> 27:57.720
science fiction, you're missing something.

28:05.020 --> 28:12.880
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:12.880 --> 28:13.640
Odessa, Texas.
