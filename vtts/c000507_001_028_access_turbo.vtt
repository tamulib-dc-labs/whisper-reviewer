00:09.020 --> 00:13.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.260 --> 00:39.920
And here are your hosts.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.320
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

00:46.580 --> 00:52.620
Edward Bryant is on the forefront of the young writers who will likely shape the course of science fiction in the 80s and 90s.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.080
We asked Bryant his definition of science fiction.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.280
Science fiction is essentially the same as any other fiction.

00:59.480 --> 01:05.120
It's fiction about people, about characters, about the relationships between one character and another,

01:05.160 --> 01:08.340
or one character and a group, which may be society,

01:08.600 --> 01:17.460
with the difference from mainstream fiction being that in science fiction there is some sort of scientific or technological development

01:17.460 --> 01:23.360
which is important to the story and which affects those human relationships

01:23.360 --> 01:29.500
between person and other person or person and people as a group.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.660
Bryant grew up on a ranch in Wyoming.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.460
After he completed graduate school, he began writing short stories.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.440
To date, he has published three collections of short stories,

01:39.820 --> 01:42.900
Among the Dead, Cinnabar, and Particle Theory.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.260
We asked Bryant why he prefers to work in the medium of the short story.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.200
It's not a matter of conscious choice.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.120
I write what I do because that is what I do.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.360
I plan to write novels.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.280
Of course, I've been planning to write novels for a long time.

02:00.760 --> 02:08.940
My publisher is expecting by October 1st a novel which was originally contracted in 1974,

02:09.800 --> 02:14.220
and this is a long while to be dithering about completing the book.

02:17.960 --> 02:26.240
Short stories have just always seemed to me the appropriate medium that I should work in.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.720
In some ways, I could agree.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.100
I feel like short stories are mini novels

02:36.080 --> 02:43.600
because I have often spent much more time in terms of working out the characterizations,

02:43.600 --> 02:45.960
the plots, and so forth and so on,

02:46.840 --> 02:52.900
than the amount of space in that short story would indicate.

02:54.720 --> 03:03.440
There are stories of mine that seem to me to be almost compressed novels that, under other circumstances,

03:03.720 --> 03:08.880
were I more prolific writer, I probably could have expanded them out another 54,000 words

03:08.880 --> 03:13.980
and got a nice paperback original novel.

03:14.660 --> 03:19.320
But I like to work with the compression sometimes.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.960
I like to pack an incredible amount,

03:22.200 --> 03:23.840
which is a risk, of course,

03:23.840 --> 03:32.480
because I fully recognize that a lot of people who read my stuff

03:32.480 --> 03:36.460
don't care to deal in that sort of thing.

03:36.740 --> 03:39.920
They don't want to have to worry about putting that kind of energy

03:39.920 --> 03:43.500
into reading a short story that they might ordinarily apply

03:43.500 --> 03:46.820
to at least starting to approach a novel.

03:48.060 --> 03:51.380
Phoenix Without Ashes is Bryant's only novel published to date,

03:51.520 --> 03:53.760
and it's a collaboration with Harlan Ellison.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.900
We ask if he is planning to publish a novel eventually.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.740
I think, I really believe,

04:01.040 --> 04:03.320
that there are things that I want to write about

04:03.320 --> 04:08.400
that I can treat much better as novels,

04:08.440 --> 04:09.780
but I can't as short stories.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.840
And I think I would do that.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.080
I think right now the bottleneck factor

04:15.080 --> 04:20.360
is that I haven't done a scratch novel that's worked.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.220
I've done Phoenix, which is a novelization.

04:23.220 --> 04:26.960
I've done Cinnabar, which is a sort of piecework novel

04:26.960 --> 04:31.080
made up of parts that were originally published as short stories.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.900
And I've done a 60,000-word novel,

04:34.900 --> 04:38.540
which remains in my files, has never been rewritten,

04:38.700 --> 04:40.280
has never been submitted professionally,

04:40.520 --> 04:42.160
is not science fiction or fantasy.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.860
It's the traditional college novel

04:44.860 --> 04:47.420
that editors know and abominate.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.020
They get thousands of them every year.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.940
They're the novels that people write just after college,

04:52.940 --> 04:55.920
in which the young writer says,

04:56.100 --> 04:58.520
well, I have come of age in this society,

04:58.520 --> 05:01.500
and here are the wonderful truths that I have learned.

05:01.780 --> 05:03.440
And they put all this into fiction,

05:03.440 --> 05:06.520
and it's usually just pretty terrible stuff.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.240
More on Edward Bryant on our next show.

05:16.740 --> 05:19.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:19.540 --> 05:22.380
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:22.660 --> 05:25.740
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.420


05:54.640 --> 05:54.720


05:54.720 --> 05:54.880


06:10.720 --> 06:14.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.120
And here are your hosts.

06:45.660 --> 06:48.020
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.700
Science fiction writer Edward Bryant is the subject of today's show.

06:51.700 --> 06:57.440
Probably Bryant's most important contribution to date is his collection of connected stories called Cinnabar.

06:57.640 --> 07:02.300
Here Bryant tells something about the city of Cinnabar, the place around which the stories revolve.

07:03.080 --> 07:12.440
No matter whether it's a short story or a novel, and no matter how complex the ultimate product might be originally,

07:12.440 --> 07:17.660
there always is the single image somewhere along the line that everything else generated from.

07:17.660 --> 07:23.380
In the case of Cinnabar, I suppose the overriding image is the city itself.

07:23.840 --> 07:31.740
The city that exists presumably millions of years in our future and may or may not exist here on Earth.

07:31.740 --> 07:36.400
That's never really spelled out, nor did I feel it important to do so.

07:36.500 --> 07:43.020
Although I suspect to pin down, I would suggest that Cinnabar is probably very close to Phoenix, Arizona.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.680
I shouldn't be surprised.

07:47.180 --> 07:57.300
But in the late 1960s, I just had the image of the far future, very colorful, emerald city of Oz,

07:57.640 --> 08:01.720
sort of apparition, wavering out there on the desert horizon.

08:01.720 --> 08:11.120
And of course, once the image was there, then all the questions of both fiction in general and science fiction in particular generated,

08:11.380 --> 08:15.000
such as, okay, what is that city all about?

08:15.140 --> 08:15.980
Who lives there?

08:16.100 --> 08:16.920
What do they do?

08:16.920 --> 08:26.260
I wanted to write about a city of such sophistication and decadence that science and technology,

08:26.600 --> 08:32.140
as Arthur C. Clarke put in a different context, might as well be magic.

08:33.420 --> 08:41.720
And I wanted to, in terms of the human element, investigate what would people do with their access to immortality,

08:41.860 --> 08:45.260
with their access to technological powers beyond compare.

08:46.140 --> 08:51.480
Would their lives be any less screwed up than they are now in 20th century America, or not?

08:51.700 --> 08:56.700
So again, I was going back to that original premise that I believe in,

08:56.860 --> 09:01.080
that good fiction is about people and their relationships.

09:02.060 --> 09:05.980
And if you have access to physical immortality, for example,

09:06.140 --> 09:10.500
how does this affect your relationship with the people that are closest to you

09:10.500 --> 09:13.300
and the people that you interact with every day on the street?

09:14.120 --> 09:18.220
And that's what Cinnabar finally is all about.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.260
Although Bryant conceived of the stories as separate entities,

09:22.580 --> 09:25.520
he eventually realized how closely tied they all are.

09:26.280 --> 09:30.460
And it came as a great surprise to me, as I wrote these stories,

09:31.240 --> 09:34.240
about that fabulous city,

09:34.520 --> 09:41.280
that there was an all-over structure that seemed to be coming out independent of each individual story.

09:41.540 --> 09:46.460
And that's why when you read the stories all together in a book,

09:46.620 --> 09:50.720
I feel there is a clear-cut beginning and a clear-cut ending,

09:50.720 --> 09:55.640
and there is progress made through the stories,

09:55.640 --> 10:00.380
almost as though one were reading a from-scratch novel,

10:00.640 --> 10:02.260
even though, of course, it isn't.

10:02.540 --> 10:06.760
I weasel a lot with the definition of what is a novel there and what isn't.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.980
Still, the background is the same from story to story.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.020
Most of the characters are the same from story to story.

10:14.980 --> 10:18.040
The origin of the name Cinnabar is an interesting story.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.040
Here Bryant tells us what inspired it.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.220
Now the city title,

10:25.140 --> 10:29.980
strangely enough, came originally from a photograph of a horse.

10:31.580 --> 10:39.460
My mother, in her living room, has a beautiful photograph of the head of a palomino.

10:40.860 --> 10:44.500
This was a picture she told me about when I was growing up,

10:44.520 --> 10:47.600
because this was the horse that she used to ride in the summers

10:47.600 --> 10:51.140
out at a dude ranch in upstate New York called the Cinnabar.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.360
And I'd always loved the sound of the word.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.900
It conjured up all sorts of images for me

10:58.900 --> 11:03.160
that I think went far beyond your standard upstate New York dude ranch.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.120
More on Edward Bryant's Cinnabar next time.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

11:17.580 --> 11:20.360
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:20.360 --> 11:23.720
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.180


12:06.120 --> 12:08.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

12:09.080 --> 12:10.200
so stay with us.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.160


12:11.160 --> 12:11.620


12:16.340 --> 12:16.900


12:16.900 --> 12:17.740


12:17.740 --> 12:17.840


12:19.760 --> 12:20.320


12:20.320 --> 12:20.420


12:26.810 --> 12:29.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

12:29.280 --> 12:31.920
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.000


12:34.660 --> 12:35.360


12:35.360 --> 12:35.380


12:35.380 --> 12:35.840


12:35.840 --> 12:36.380
And here are your hosts.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.460
This is David Carson and Bill Vernon.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.380
Our show today centers again on the Cinnabar stories by Edward Bryant.

12:47.700 --> 12:51.980
In the acknowledgments of Cinnabar, Bryant writes to Joan Bernat,

12:52.120 --> 12:54.480
who pioneered in the writing of Cinnabar stories.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.780
Here he explains this acknowledgment.

12:57.360 --> 13:02.900
Joan Bernat was a very good writer who did a number of stories at the early Clarion workshops,

13:02.920 --> 13:05.560
which were published in various anthologies,

13:05.560 --> 13:07.280
and I have no idea where she is now.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.840
But at one point in the workshop, we'd done an exercise

13:11.840 --> 13:15.380
in which each of us came up with various narrative hooks,

13:15.640 --> 13:20.620
first lines of stories which were calculated to catch the interest of the reader.

13:21.500 --> 13:26.780
And I had done a story hook which went along the lines of,

13:27.580 --> 13:32.920
oh, I think the road to Cinnabar was lined with the shells of burnt-out school buses.

13:34.220 --> 13:38.500
And I had no particular reason for coming up with this line other than,

13:38.780 --> 13:40.940
to me, it was interesting.

13:41.220 --> 13:45.500
And also this was vaguely tied in with my image of Cinnabar the city.

13:45.980 --> 13:50.700
Well, a number of people in the workshop borrowed other people's narrative hooks

13:50.700 --> 13:51.920
and wrote stories around them.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.820
And Joan Bernat actually did the first Cinnabar story

13:54.820 --> 13:59.380
in the sense that she wrote a story which started with that line.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.820
And her Cinnabar was not quite the same as mine,

14:03.820 --> 14:06.880
but still there was something of the feeling about it,

14:07.120 --> 14:11.720
the almost surrealistic image of the city wavering on the horizon,

14:11.720 --> 14:15.580
the city which is totally cut off from the entire rest of the world.

14:15.580 --> 14:19.360
In fact, for all intents and purposes, is the entire world.

14:19.980 --> 14:24.300
And so that's why Joan Bernat got the acknowledgement at the beginning of the book.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.820
The stories collected in Cinnabar are not the only Cinnabar stories.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.680
Others have been published elsewhere.

14:31.060 --> 14:35.200
We asked Brian if he has plans to write still other stories in the Cinnabar milieu.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.320
I've thought about it.

14:37.580 --> 14:41.940
I have notes on several Cinnabar stories,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.500
including the possibility of doing five novelettes,

14:45.560 --> 14:52.160
which would come together as another makeup novel about the character Jade Blue.

14:52.520 --> 14:58.960
My publisher and I would like to do a new edition of Cinnabar

14:58.960 --> 15:00.880
with a brand new Cinnabar story in it.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.720
But I don't know.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.000
I just haven't been able to do a Cinnabar story.

15:06.120 --> 15:13.100
It may be that its time has passed in terms of my own professional nature.

15:14.760 --> 15:18.020
The Cinnabar stories that I've got planned out would take place

15:18.020 --> 15:20.380
before the time of the stories in the book itself

15:20.380 --> 15:22.600
because, of course, at the end of the book,

15:22.780 --> 15:25.580
I don't think I'm giving away any plot secrets here.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.180
Cinnabar is in the process of being destroyed.

15:28.180 --> 15:35.380
I've had no desire to write stories about Cinnabar after the fall.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.040
But before, there are still possibilities.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.900
I would like to do, for example,

15:41.080 --> 15:43.920
a story about a man in Cinnabar

15:43.920 --> 15:48.800
who comes up with the greatest decadent luxury anyone could have.

15:48.800 --> 15:54.340
I thought for a long time about what single luxury would be the most decadent,

15:54.520 --> 15:58.920
the most useless example of conspicuous affluence.

15:59.260 --> 16:03.960
And I realized, of course, that probably what would be comprised in that

16:03.960 --> 16:05.900
would be having your own roller coaster.

16:06.720 --> 16:10.820
I mean, think how decadent to have your own roller coaster sitting out behind your house,

16:10.860 --> 16:14.240
which only you use, or your friends, of course.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.820
And so I immediately, because I love roller coasters a lot,

16:17.980 --> 16:21.000
started to design my own version of the ultimate roller coaster.

16:21.720 --> 16:28.820
And that is going to be the central image in that particular story, if it's ever written.

16:29.260 --> 16:32.000
Another Cinnabar story, which is yet unwritten,

16:32.260 --> 16:38.280
is what happens when Tourmaline Hayes decides to have an enormous party

16:38.280 --> 16:42.720
at which she invites every single one of her old lovers,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.960
of which she has quite a few.

16:45.800 --> 16:50.440
And this will simply be a party at which you have no idea

16:50.440 --> 16:54.100
whether it's going to be a romantic comedy or a murder mystery.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.120
A lot of possibilities there.

16:56.860 --> 16:59.580
In our next show, we'll talk more about Edward Bryant.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:09.880 --> 17:12.680
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:12.960 --> 17:15.980
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:35.040 --> 17:45.460


17:56.500 --> 17:59.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:59.400 --> 18:00.520
so stay with us.

18:16.780 --> 18:19.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

18:19.520 --> 18:22.160
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.580
And here are your hosts.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.540
This is David Carson.

18:32.780 --> 18:33.480
And Bill Vernon.

18:33.820 --> 18:37.300
Today we continue with our interview with science fiction author Edward Bryant.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.200
Those who are at all familiar with Bryant's work

18:40.200 --> 18:43.160
have certainly come across his apparent fascination with sharks.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.200
Here he explains how this attraction was spawned,

18:46.220 --> 18:49.160
then how it led to the famous short story titled simply,

18:49.620 --> 18:49.800
Shark.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.920
Why sharks?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.660
You know, when people visit my apartment,

18:55.660 --> 18:57.280
they see all sorts of shark paraphernalia,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.160
you know, jaws mounted on backboards

19:00.160 --> 19:03.900
and shark mobiles, shark paintings,

19:04.080 --> 19:05.020
and so forth and so on.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.700
The reason for the shark motif,

19:09.560 --> 19:14.200
and the reason that I suppose I've adopted the shark as a sort of totem,

19:14.560 --> 19:17.000
is because in the early 70s,

19:17.630 --> 19:21.500
one of my closest friends had dreamed the night before,

19:21.720 --> 19:23.300
and she told me about this at breakfast,

19:23.300 --> 19:26.360
that she had been in the body of a shark.

19:26.680 --> 19:31.100
She had seen the world through shark-colored lenses.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.560
And we talked about this for a while,

19:35.740 --> 19:38.780
you know, got past the obvious Freudian symbolism of it all,

19:39.980 --> 19:41.900
and I was fascinated by the dream.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.800
Then she catalyzed action by saying,

19:45.920 --> 19:49.680
listen, why don't you write a story about sharks?

19:49.960 --> 19:51.700
Now, I didn't know anything about sharks.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.840
I was just an inland boy who'd grown up far from the sea,

19:54.860 --> 19:57.500
and although the ocean has always fascinated me,

19:57.600 --> 19:58.580
I didn't know about sharks.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.140
But I did my research,

20:00.380 --> 20:02.000
just as with, say, particle theory.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.680
I found out about sharks.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.340
I became intrigued by their position

20:06.340 --> 20:08.640
in the evolutionary scheme of things,

20:08.720 --> 20:11.120
how incredibly well-developed they are.

20:11.380 --> 20:14.640
And I was also struck by such images

20:14.640 --> 20:16.800
as the fact that the shark

20:16.800 --> 20:19.860
is the major species of creature

20:19.860 --> 20:22.500
which is hostile to human beings,

20:22.500 --> 20:25.000
which is in no danger of extinction,

20:25.480 --> 20:26.480
at least at this point.

20:27.300 --> 20:31.740
So I took my friend's original dream

20:31.740 --> 20:33.780
and I said, okay,

20:34.280 --> 20:37.300
I've got a character who wants to be a shark.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.660
Why does she want to be a shark?

20:39.880 --> 20:41.540
How does she become a shark,

20:41.760 --> 20:44.000
both metaphorically and literally?

20:44.360 --> 20:47.800
And that's how the original shark story generated.

20:48.980 --> 20:51.340
I realized after finishing the story

20:51.340 --> 20:54.280
that there were other things that involved sharks

20:54.280 --> 20:56.420
that I had not dealt with in the story

20:56.420 --> 21:00.420
that I would treat in various other pieces.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.100
When Bryant's friends got wind

21:10.100 --> 21:11.380
of his newfound fascination,

21:11.600 --> 21:13.960
he began to be bombarded with shark mementos.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.180
What happened then, of course,

21:16.640 --> 21:17.840
was the older you get,

21:18.320 --> 21:20.380
I think the harder you are to shop for

21:20.380 --> 21:21.640
your friends and relatives.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.160
They don't know what to get you.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.780
They don't know what your tastes are.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.980
They don't know what books you've read

21:25.980 --> 21:27.860
or what albums you don't have.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.940
So somehow the shark story

21:31.940 --> 21:34.100
caught the fancy of the people around me

21:34.100 --> 21:36.060
and I started giving me shark paraphernalia.

21:36.160 --> 21:36.960
Before I knew it,

21:37.040 --> 21:39.200
I had more sharks than I knew what to do with.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.400
I'm glad it was sharks

21:41.400 --> 21:44.220
because Jaws notwithstanding,

21:44.240 --> 21:45.860
there never has been that much

21:45.860 --> 21:48.380
in the way of shark artifacts for sale.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.460
If it had been unicorns or dragons,

21:50.460 --> 21:52.020
say I would have been swamped

21:52.020 --> 21:52.760
completely and utterly

21:52.760 --> 21:54.360
and I could have knick-knack

21:54.360 --> 21:56.460
and gee-gaw garage sales.

21:57.340 --> 21:57.940
But instead,

21:58.160 --> 22:00.020
I've got some pretty neat shark stuff.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.460
Does Bryant really like sharks?

22:03.300 --> 22:04.360
I would say, though,

22:04.480 --> 22:06.700
that people ask me,

22:06.720 --> 22:08.480
do I really like sharks?

22:08.620 --> 22:09.180
And I have to admit,

22:09.260 --> 22:09.940
I don't like sharks.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.260
Nobody likes sharks,

22:11.860 --> 22:13.600
but I respect sharks.

22:14.340 --> 22:17.260
And sharks as an emblem,

22:17.480 --> 22:18.200
as a symbol,

22:19.140 --> 22:20.640
truly do fascinate me.

22:20.860 --> 22:22.340
And I expect there will be

22:22.340 --> 22:23.400
other shark stories.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.560
There may even be a shark novel.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.380
What militates against a shark novel,

22:27.540 --> 22:27.720
of course,

22:27.840 --> 22:30.160
quite aside from any of my own feelings

22:30.160 --> 22:31.220
about writing a novel,

22:31.380 --> 22:34.400
is I probably have to wait

22:34.400 --> 22:38.780
for the furore of Peter Benchley's Jaws

22:38.780 --> 22:40.560
to continue dying down.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.080
More on Edward Bryant

22:43.080 --> 22:43.840
on our next show.

22:50.960 --> 22:51.860
This has been

22:51.860 --> 22:53.540
the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:53.700 --> 22:54.440
a production of the

22:54.440 --> 22:56.440
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:56.440 --> 22:57.560
produced in conjunction

22:57.560 --> 22:58.640
with Odessa College

22:58.640 --> 22:59.720
in Odessa, Texas.

23:19.360 --> 23:29.220


23:40.820 --> 23:42.000
Coming up next is

23:42.000 --> 23:43.520
the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:43.680 --> 23:44.760
so stay with us.

24:00.660 --> 24:03.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

24:03.460 --> 24:06.040
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.440
And here are your hosts.

24:14.900 --> 24:16.180
This is David Carson.

24:16.200 --> 24:16.920
And Bill Vernon.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.420
In the fall of 1981,

24:18.860 --> 24:20.620
Edward Bryant's important short story collection,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.040
Particle Theory, was published.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.180
It contains memorable stories,

24:24.640 --> 24:25.580
"The Thermals of August",

24:25.860 --> 24:27.680
The Nebula Award-winning "giANTS",

24:27.980 --> 24:29.580
The often reprinted "Shark",

24:29.940 --> 24:31.120
"The Hibakusha Gallery",

24:31.340 --> 24:32.380
and the title story.

24:32.580 --> 24:34.180
The story "Particle Theory"

24:34.180 --> 24:35.780
is unique in Bryant's canon

24:35.780 --> 24:36.800
in that its background

24:36.800 --> 24:38.860
is heavily laden with hard science.

24:38.860 --> 24:41.000
Here he explains how any writer

24:41.000 --> 24:42.800
can get across hard science ideas

24:42.800 --> 24:44.680
if he uses the right resources.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.860
Particle theory came about

24:46.860 --> 24:48.600
because I read a newspaper article

24:48.600 --> 24:50.120
about pion beam therapy

24:51.240 --> 24:53.420
using a stream of solid particles,

24:53.560 --> 24:54.540
subnuclear particles,

24:54.580 --> 24:56.740
to attack cancerous tumors,

24:57.380 --> 24:59.200
which I have just found out

24:59.200 --> 25:00.160
is a line of research

25:00.160 --> 25:01.540
that has just been abandoned

25:01.540 --> 25:02.700
down at Los Alamos.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.880
I'm not sure why,

25:04.040 --> 25:05.220
whether it's funding cutbacks

25:05.220 --> 25:06.800
or whether they've simply found

25:06.800 --> 25:09.640
better means to attack the medical problem.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.400
But at any rate,

25:11.260 --> 25:12.460
what had intrigued me

25:12.460 --> 25:13.800
a number of years ago in the paper

25:13.800 --> 25:16.960
is now apparently scientifically dead.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.120
And yeah,

25:19.320 --> 25:21.440
this is more of a hard science story

25:21.440 --> 25:22.740
than I customarily write,

25:22.740 --> 25:26.100
but I think it exhibits

25:27.000 --> 25:29.020
a more general principle,

25:29.280 --> 25:30.800
which is that I

25:30.800 --> 25:32.360
or every other writer

25:32.360 --> 25:34.060
who may not be

25:34.060 --> 25:35.560
all that soundly based

25:35.560 --> 25:37.060
in science and technology

25:37.060 --> 25:38.580
by discipline

25:38.580 --> 25:40.160
or by vocation

25:40.160 --> 25:42.460
need simply only use

25:42.460 --> 25:44.060
the research tools

25:44.060 --> 25:45.300
that we all presumably learned

25:45.300 --> 25:46.080
in junior high

25:46.080 --> 25:47.500
to get across

25:47.500 --> 25:49.400
a hard science story

25:49.400 --> 25:52.900
without being overly didactic about it.

25:53.140 --> 25:54.920
What I discovered in this story

25:54.920 --> 25:56.200
was that the world

25:56.200 --> 25:57.140
is full of experts

25:57.140 --> 25:58.120
who were quite willing

25:58.120 --> 25:58.960
to share with me

25:58.960 --> 26:00.140
their specialized knowledge,

26:00.140 --> 26:00.800
whether it was

26:00.800 --> 26:02.180
particle beam physics

26:02.180 --> 26:03.360
or whether it was

26:03.360 --> 26:05.140
the landscape around Los Alamos

26:05.140 --> 26:08.540
and little details

26:08.540 --> 26:09.920
for verisimilitude,

26:09.920 --> 26:11.260
such as what airline

26:11.260 --> 26:13.100
do you fly into Los Alamos on

26:13.100 --> 26:14.340
and what sort of planes

26:14.340 --> 26:14.980
are you in

26:14.980 --> 26:16.600
and all of that kind of thing.

26:17.220 --> 26:18.460
Bryant comments here

26:18.460 --> 26:18.900
on the fact

26:18.900 --> 26:19.680
that he does not wish

26:19.680 --> 26:20.420
to be typecast

26:20.420 --> 26:20.880
as a writer

26:20.880 --> 26:22.420
of any particular type of story.

26:23.260 --> 26:23.740
True.

26:23.940 --> 26:24.340
Ordinarily,

26:24.340 --> 26:25.120
I don't use

26:25.120 --> 26:25.900
quite so much

26:25.900 --> 26:26.980
scientific content.

26:27.460 --> 26:27.980
All I can say

26:27.980 --> 26:29.360
is this was one of the stories

26:29.360 --> 26:30.560
in which that content

26:30.560 --> 26:31.620
seemed appropriate

26:32.840 --> 26:35.300
and it exhibits

26:36.100 --> 26:37.060
my own,

26:37.560 --> 26:38.280
in a sense,

26:38.400 --> 26:39.600
my own sense of frustration

26:40.160 --> 26:41.920
with being typecast.

26:42.620 --> 26:44.620
I write what I like to write

26:44.620 --> 26:45.660
and sometimes

26:45.660 --> 26:47.260
that may be a story

26:47.260 --> 26:48.260
which is full of

26:48.260 --> 26:49.640
medical research

26:49.640 --> 26:51.060
about prostate cancer

26:51.060 --> 26:54.040
and particle beam therapy

26:54.040 --> 26:55.800
for that cancer

26:55.800 --> 26:58.060
and cosmology,

26:58.880 --> 26:59.880
all that.

27:00.680 --> 27:01.280
And other times

27:01.280 --> 27:01.780
I will write

27:01.780 --> 27:02.940
science fiction stories

27:02.940 --> 27:04.520
in which there is not

27:04.520 --> 27:05.740
a speck

27:05.740 --> 27:07.160
of hard research

27:07.160 --> 27:08.280
or hard fact.

27:09.240 --> 27:09.920
Again,

27:09.960 --> 27:11.200
I suppose it illustrates

27:11.200 --> 27:11.640
the difference

27:11.640 --> 27:13.200
between facts and truths

27:13.200 --> 27:14.440
to be facile about it.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.840
But it also shows

27:17.840 --> 27:18.640
that good research

27:18.640 --> 27:19.820
can cover a multitude

27:19.820 --> 27:20.420
of sins.

27:20.760 --> 27:21.760
He maintains

27:21.760 --> 27:22.360
that even with

27:22.360 --> 27:23.660
the hard science elements,

27:23.960 --> 27:24.700
particle theory

27:24.700 --> 27:26.160
is still a people story.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.680
This story for me

27:27.680 --> 27:28.740
is still a people story

27:28.740 --> 27:29.640
first and foremost.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.260
It's, again,

27:31.420 --> 27:32.240
about relationships

27:32.240 --> 27:32.840
of people

27:32.840 --> 27:34.940
and the scientific content

27:35.620 --> 27:36.220
amplifies,

27:37.400 --> 27:38.000
illustrates,

27:38.160 --> 27:39.180
and I hope clarifies

27:39.180 --> 27:40.380
those relationships.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.900
But, by God,

27:42.060 --> 27:43.360
the people still come first

27:43.360 --> 27:44.520
and the science

27:44.520 --> 27:45.180
and technology

27:45.180 --> 27:45.800
come second.

27:51.820 --> 27:52.940
Bryant's first published

27:52.940 --> 27:53.880
short story collection,

27:54.100 --> 27:54.820
Among the Dead,

27:55.040 --> 27:56.180
came out in 1973.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.740
It contains a number

27:57.740 --> 27:58.520
of stories written

27:58.520 --> 27:59.480
early in his career.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.500
His novel,

28:00.660 --> 28:01.680
Phoenix Without Ashes,

28:01.800 --> 28:02.360
is in fact

28:02.360 --> 28:03.200
a novelization

28:03.200 --> 28:04.280
of Harlan Ellison's

28:04.280 --> 28:05.520
original pilot script

28:05.520 --> 28:06.540
for the ill-fated

28:06.540 --> 28:07.620
television series,

28:07.780 --> 28:08.700
The Star Lost,

28:08.700 --> 28:10.200
This work is a rarity.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.620
As a novelization,

28:11.860 --> 28:13.000
which came after the fact,

28:13.160 --> 28:13.860
it is actually

28:13.860 --> 28:15.020
a solid piece of work.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.380
The planned sequels

28:16.380 --> 28:17.740
have never materialized.

28:18.040 --> 28:18.600
Certainly,

28:18.720 --> 28:19.200
Edward Bryant

28:19.200 --> 28:20.200
has established himself

28:20.200 --> 28:21.320
as a top-flight writer

28:21.320 --> 28:22.540
who happens also

28:22.540 --> 28:23.640
to work under the label

28:23.640 --> 28:24.460
science fiction.

28:31.700 --> 28:32.580
This has been

28:32.580 --> 28:33.400
the Science Fiction

28:33.400 --> 28:34.260
Radio Show,

28:34.400 --> 28:35.060
a production of

28:35.060 --> 28:35.820
the Permian Basin

28:35.820 --> 28:37.120
Science Fiction Association,

28:37.120 --> 28:38.240
produced in conjunction

28:38.240 --> 28:39.240
with Odessa College

28:39.240 --> 28:40.380
in Odessa, Texas.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.120


28:46.120 --> 28:52.540


28:58.740 --> 28:59.100


28:59.100 --> 29:00.820


29:00.820 --> 29:01.020


29:01.060 --> 29:01.160


29:03.500 --> 29:03.860


29:03.860 --> 29:04.040


29:04.040 --> 29:04.120


29:04.120 --> 29:04.180


29:05.680 --> 29:06.040
