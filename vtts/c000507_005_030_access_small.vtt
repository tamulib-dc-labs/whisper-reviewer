00:01.120 --> 00:06.660
In my frame of reference, they're both speculative fiction.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.080
There's an awful lot of discussion about this.

00:14.420 --> 00:17.080
I don't think it's a very productive kind of a discussion.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.120
It's practically everything.

00:20.760 --> 00:27.360
There certainly is a fiction based upon cold, hard science.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.540
There's no question about that.

00:28.540 --> 00:35.080
And on the other hand, there's fiction based upon fairies and wizards.

00:35.620 --> 00:51.520
But in general, most of the stories that you read are all based upon invented laws of science which aren't in evidence.

00:54.180 --> 01:01.440
And it's a kind of a very difficult line of distinction to make here.

01:02.320 --> 01:19.300
Now, as far as I got all this aside, I will say that I start even though I don't feel that I say that there's a very thin,

01:19.300 --> 01:21.340
if any boundary between these two things.

01:22.040 --> 01:30.720
In general, I think I start with a mood of the story rather than a plot or an easy sort.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.720
I start with a mood of...

01:34.300 --> 01:45.420
And then go on and flesh it out and put characters to the mood and atmosphere and background, stuff like that.

01:45.420 --> 01:55.900
And in this mood, of course, takes account of the fact that the situations are more or less plausible and possible and credible.

01:58.440 --> 02:05.960
Or that probably I could state that better by saying that the assumptions are more familiar.

02:06.980 --> 02:16.860
Because given any assumptions, every story starts out with a set of assumptions which readers require to believe in.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.060
And with so-called...

02:21.060 --> 02:27.700
The closer the stuff is to pure science and the more familiar to the reader, or not to the reader so much,

02:27.700 --> 02:33.700
with the more familiar to the scientific community is the assumptions.

02:34.200 --> 02:39.080
And the closer you get to pure fantasy, then the more remote are the assumptions made.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.700
But the assumptions are just less, or they're on the left.

02:43.860 --> 02:46.280
You don't have these basic assumptions and you don't have any story.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.260
Now, when was the first part of your question once more?

02:50.920 --> 02:51.900
I answered the last.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.600
Got what the first part was.

02:54.580 --> 02:55.680
Okay, hold on one moment.

03:00.020 --> 03:06.420
Yes, Mr. Vance, I ask how you proceeded from your ideas to a completed story.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.260
Well, I can't answer that.

03:08.380 --> 03:11.420
It's because I don't know myself.

03:11.680 --> 03:22.940
It's just a matter of sitting down and working around an idea and putting...flushing it out, so to speak.

03:23.560 --> 03:29.640
It's just the same way as if you were painting a landscape.

03:30.180 --> 03:34.600
You'd take a pencil and maybe you would, maybe you would.

03:35.020 --> 03:41.820
And draw in an outline of a tree in a house and then take up the color and start smearing green for the foliage

03:41.820 --> 03:48.620
and circle of smoke coming out of the chimney of the house and geraniums in the window boxes.

03:49.400 --> 03:57.300
In other words, you start in with a framework and then start elaborating upon it.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.120
That's about the best I can tell you.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.580
That suits you, doesn't it?

04:05.360 --> 04:06.500
Oh, yes, very much.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.020
We have another second person in here for a question.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.800
All right, I prefer you to only ask one question at a time so I don't get confused.

04:15.260 --> 04:15.500
Okay.

04:16.700 --> 04:22.660
Mr. Vance, what method do you use to come up with the names for your characters and places?

04:24.960 --> 04:30.240
This is a...I do it very carefully.

04:31.500 --> 04:35.280
And it's not in and miss.

04:35.660 --> 04:40.740
It is not just random picking a name on the phone but cut off.

04:41.520 --> 04:46.500
What you're hearing in the background there, there's a gang of birds from cages right over here.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.180
They hear me talking like this.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.940
They get annoyed and they'll start yelling and screaming too.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.620
You may hear them, I don't know.

04:53.320 --> 05:04.500
But anyway, the names for the characters, they have to be such that they don't intrude on the reader's notice.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.140
Every time he reads them, he says, I think that's strange.

05:07.440 --> 05:14.040
What's strange, a name with all these odd-looking consonants and those...

05:14.040 --> 05:26.640
The name has to be such that it'll flow along in the reading and not the reader's tongue won't trip over it every time he gets to it.

05:26.640 --> 05:32.020
Still, you don't do it like it's a comic strip.

05:32.160 --> 05:41.600
In a comic strip, the bad guys are always called Gnarr or Nash or something, you know.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.640
That's really getting too basic.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.380
You don't do it that way.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.160
You do it in more subtle ways.

05:52.160 --> 06:03.920
You possibly go back to the rips of the language, rips of either Germanic language or rips of Latin language.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.060
And you come up with some kind of...

06:08.060 --> 06:12.200
I'm not saying I do this overtly, but it's a subconscious process.

06:12.920 --> 06:23.400
Then you kind of write down names that seem like they will fit this character and what he's supposed to do and what he's supposed to be.

06:24.380 --> 06:29.280
Then after you take all these things into consideration, then you choose what names seem to fit.

06:30.220 --> 06:37.840
And they say it's not just an easy matter, although quite often the name will just suddenly pop out and you know the name is right.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.500
But in my opinion, it's a pretty important matter, this nomenclature.

06:43.140 --> 06:51.220
It's nothing that if any of you people are would-be writers, I think you should pay a good deal of attention to it.

06:51.840 --> 06:58.960
Because if you don't, it traps up the reader when it goes through your stories.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.680
It's going to fall all over that name.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.040
It's phony. You know, you can't have phony names in your story.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.100
You can't have anything phony.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.100
It all has to blend in and...

07:10.000 --> 07:10.760
There you hear that bird?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.060
Maybe not. Well, there's maybe a bird.

07:14.660 --> 07:15.760
Anyway, that's the answer.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.800
Okay, very good.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.960
I have a question, but mine's a multiple question.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.600
I'm sorry to ask you, but...

07:25.600 --> 07:26.860
Well, ask a part of it.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.440
I'll just ask a piece at a time.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.820
Do you find science fantasy easier to write than science fiction?

07:33.160 --> 07:33.760
What'd you say again?

07:33.760 --> 07:37.380
Do you find science fantasy easier to write than science fiction?

07:38.060 --> 07:41.500
Well, not particularly. It's all about the sea.

07:42.820 --> 07:52.000
Okay, and do you find that you get more, I don't know, gratification and explaining in science fiction

07:53.580 --> 07:57.820
than you would in science fantasy where you can run away on other aspects of the story?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.540
Well, I...

07:59.540 --> 08:01.100
When I was first starting out,

08:02.420 --> 08:06.120
this was the age when science fiction was real.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.520
Science fiction, you know, when John Campbell ran The Sounding Magazine

08:11.100 --> 08:13.760
and he wanted science fiction to be science fiction.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.640
And everybody was kind of slavishly running that route.

08:17.820 --> 08:25.300
And I tried to for a bit, and I did some perfectly decent stories along those lines,

08:25.860 --> 08:28.720
but I found that it was kind of tiresome.

08:29.540 --> 08:38.260
A lot of the stories depended on some little-done trick of, oh, like, superconductivity.

08:38.980 --> 08:53.300
Or, for instance, I wrote a story once on the idea that sea creatures sequestered rare elements, rare minerals from the ocean water

08:53.300 --> 08:55.180
to build a story in this fact.

08:55.180 --> 09:01.740
But I decided that this wasn't my... I didn't like doing it that way.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.060
I wasn't really interested in writing stories about science.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.020
I have a very good scientific background.

09:09.300 --> 09:15.900
I know I know science, you know, so it's not that I'm ignorant,

09:16.660 --> 09:22.360
but I like to work the science into the stories rather than write the stories about science,

09:23.200 --> 09:24.560
if you see the distinction.

09:26.380 --> 09:33.540
So the word science and science fiction maybe is...

09:33.540 --> 09:38.360
Well, anyway, as the years went on, I just became...

09:39.240 --> 09:44.200
The science became more cultural, anthropological science, if you want to put it that way.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.940
If you're interested in science and that and all.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.360
All right, what's the second question?

09:49.220 --> 09:52.960
No, you covered everything pretty well. Thank you. That was a very good answer.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.060
Okay, next question.

10:03.660 --> 10:04.220
Okay.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.500
Mr. Vance.

10:06.820 --> 10:07.020
Speaking.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.300
What makes you rat? What inside do you make you take?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.740
No, that is a very personal question.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.200
I don't even see any reason why I should answer it.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.300
Not because I'm shy, but that's...

10:26.040 --> 10:26.520
That's...

10:27.260 --> 10:28.860
Well, I could ask the same of you.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.060
What's inside you? What makes you tick? What makes you go to school?

10:37.200 --> 10:40.400
Why do you study? Why do you survive?

10:41.860 --> 10:43.640
I was getting that...

10:43.640 --> 10:45.720
The question I... Let's go on to another question.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.960
Okay. Why do you rat? Is it money?

10:51.040 --> 10:53.440
I don't want to answer that question. That's my business.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.900
Okay, that's fair enough.

11:02.860 --> 11:03.740
Next question.

11:06.180 --> 11:11.440
Okay, it takes a moment to filter the minute out of the room without even getting feedback from the speaker phone system here.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.200
Okay, we got the next guy here. Ready?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.500
Mr. Vance, in this story, the sun is red.

11:17.380 --> 11:22.060
And I was wondering how you could have that considering when the sun...

11:22.060 --> 11:25.080
When our sun will be red, the earth will be inside the sun.

11:25.660 --> 11:28.920
This is here, fantasy here.

11:28.920 --> 11:39.260
This is... Well, it's not necessarily so, because there are dwarf red stars that are smaller than the current sun here now.

11:40.220 --> 11:46.120
I think the progression of the sun, though, first it gets to be a very large giant red sun that shrinks.

11:46.620 --> 11:47.780
I think that's the sequence.

11:49.600 --> 11:58.340
But still, still and all, these particular stories to which you refer,

12:00.660 --> 12:06.280
there are essentially fantasy stories.

12:07.840 --> 12:15.140
And the background is magic. I deal with magic in the stories.

12:15.820 --> 12:23.360
If I have to worry about whether or how big the sun is, I might as well worry about how magic works, or worry about any other things.

12:26.160 --> 12:33.720
That's just one of the assumptions which we are asked to accept, to deal with, and bring the star.

12:33.860 --> 12:40.720
Here's the earth is so old, the sun has become old and red.

12:41.380 --> 12:51.240
Now, I'm not absolutely certain whether the sun can become a dwarf red star if we have to go that route without becoming a giant red star.

12:51.240 --> 12:57.900
It may well be that the sun possibly could become a dwarf star.

13:00.960 --> 13:09.880
Although in these stories, I generally assume the sun is a little larger in diameter than it is now.

13:10.820 --> 13:13.320
So it wouldn't exactly be a dwarf star.

13:14.840 --> 13:22.520
But again, this is just decoration in the story.

13:23.580 --> 13:26.980
There's no scientific justification for it.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.820
Any more scientific justification for the ideas of magic?

13:35.100 --> 13:36.020
Next question.

13:37.520 --> 13:43.480
Mr. Vance, in your book The Dying Earth, what happened to civilization as we know it?

13:43.780 --> 13:45.220
Once again, please louder.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.800
In your book The Dying Earth, what happened to civilization as we know it?

13:51.580 --> 13:54.840
Well, when? When the sun goes off?

13:55.300 --> 13:59.580
Before that, you start to book off and there's a agenda of the mirror.

13:59.580 --> 14:14.080
Don't forget, this is many, many billion years, according to the story, and there's been many different civilizations up, down, civilizations wiped out.

14:15.540 --> 14:20.580
I usually think that I talk about there being...

14:21.200 --> 14:25.160
In fact, to tell you the truth, I've seen an inconsistency.

14:25.440 --> 14:29.420
One of my books I referred to, 43 eons, A, E, O, N, S.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.740
In another one of my books, I only deal with 21 eons.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.460
So I made a blunder there.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.420
I forgot how many eons I was using.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.000
And an eon is what you can call anything you like.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.680
But during this time span, civilizations have come and gone a hundred thousand different times.

14:52.500 --> 15:05.580
So what we have at this time, this period, are little fragments of life scattered around the so-called dying Earth.

15:05.580 --> 15:08.640
That's not my title. I didn't give the book that title, incidentally.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.480
I called it something else.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.980
But to tell you the truth, I've forgotten what I did call it.

15:16.180 --> 15:37.640
But by and large, the Earth of this particular time is kind of a wasteland, where a few isolated cities or collections or plots of people still...

15:37.640 --> 15:40.900
still live together for various reasons.

15:41.680 --> 15:48.000
But the great civilizations are all gone. They're in the past.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.180
This is a time when people kind of wander around through the ruins.

15:54.760 --> 16:02.780
That's the misdying Earth, particular New York, Mobile, atmosphere, whatever you want to call it.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.220
Next question.

16:04.820 --> 16:10.000
What happened to mankind as we know it? Did they waste away or did they disappear?

16:11.180 --> 16:14.660
Well, you read the books. I think it's all impressive in the books.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.560
Next question.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.180
Okay.

16:28.480 --> 16:37.660
Okay, in books like the Dying Earth, is there any importance or relevance to the manner in which the characters speak?

16:39.240 --> 16:44.140
One thing I must say. You're asking a lot of questions about the Dying Earth.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.940
This story was written long, long, long, long time ago.

16:48.020 --> 16:52.080
And I don't know how old your people are. They're asking questions.

16:52.700 --> 16:59.180
But I probably wasn't a great deal older than you were. I presume you're in your 20s. That's my guess.

17:00.480 --> 17:08.360
I wrote a lot of this stuff while I was a seaman, board ship. I was a deckhand able to seaman.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.520
And for a long time I couldn't get them published.

17:13.800 --> 17:24.240
And I had these things just on my files, you might say, for quite a while.

17:25.040 --> 17:32.140
But now these things are some of my first written works.

17:35.880 --> 17:47.100
Now, I've written an enormous amount of stuff since, which I personally like better than the Dying Earth.

17:47.220 --> 17:54.640
I think the Dying Earth, although many people like these books, and I guess they must have had a lot of color and a lot of drive to them.

17:54.640 --> 18:04.220
I've been told this. But we seem to be focusing a great deal on the Dying Earth, which is alright.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.100
I don't mind. Ask all about it, you want. I'll answer you.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.460
I've written other books besides that. I just want to point this out.

18:24.240 --> 18:30.520
Now, this Dying Earth thing, I forgot your question. What was your question again?

18:32.580 --> 18:39.080
He was just asking a question about the style. It seems to be that the people in the book all speak with the same sort of...

18:39.080 --> 18:52.080
Yeah, well, see, now this was a... I wrote this when I was rather young.

18:53.180 --> 19:01.360
And I was trying to achieve a consistency of tone.

19:02.380 --> 19:17.400
Now, for instance, let me put it this way. If you're building a house in Texas, you're not going to bring down some igloos from Alaska,

19:18.140 --> 19:24.400
or some mosques from Turkey to put on the property.

19:24.400 --> 19:30.520
And you're not going to have the people that work for you speak in Yiddish or Polynesian.

19:31.640 --> 19:40.640
You're all going to be... The house and the people that live there are going to be talking in Texas, type language.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.800
The house is going to be Texas-style. You're going to have Texas-style cows.

19:47.180 --> 19:59.640
And eat Texas chili. And I hope you don't use that hated tomato in your chili, because I'm on that edge of the conflict

19:59.640 --> 20:03.660
that believes that tomato is poisonous when it goes in the chili.

20:05.400 --> 20:14.000
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that what I'll be too facetious here is that I tried to make the conversation

20:16.840 --> 20:25.060
consistent with the dialogue, consistent with the whole atmosphere.

20:26.380 --> 20:31.700
Right? Anyway, essentially that's the answer. No more, no less.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.340
Whether I succeed it, that's for you to say.

20:37.100 --> 20:41.020
Okay, Mr. Vance, let's... Before we let you go, I want to ask you a few about lioness.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.440
One of your later works. Is that okay? Do you have time for a couple on that?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.880
Yes, call it right. I'm not doing anything. You're sitting here.

20:47.020 --> 20:51.400
Okay, is it okay if we record this in case maybe we can get a couple of radio shows out of it and send you the tapes?

20:51.500 --> 20:51.960
Would that be okay?

20:52.280 --> 20:52.740
Sure, go ahead.

20:53.360 --> 20:59.240
Okay. We understand there was a delay in the Underwood Miller edition coming out.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.260
Can you tell us why that was?

21:01.000 --> 21:08.480
Yes, I can. It's just not considered polite for putting them, Berkeley putting them,

21:08.480 --> 21:15.240
did not necessarily have to let allow Tim Underwood to publish the lioness at all.

21:15.880 --> 21:22.400
See, it's not my contract that allows Tim Underwood to publish these things,

21:23.020 --> 21:29.080
but they kindly, politely, graciously allowed Tim to publish 500 copies hardcover,

21:30.760 --> 21:43.160
but they wanted to have their version out first so that the reviews, such as they were, would specify the book was by Berkeley putting them, rather than Underwood Miller book.

21:44.100 --> 21:51.340
So Tim delayed his publication until the Berkeley putting them book hit the stand.

21:51.340 --> 22:02.420
There's just a matter of not only courtesy, but it's a good consideration, but it's just good common sense,

22:02.580 --> 22:08.760
because if you didn't play it that way, they'd never allow Tim to the same privileges again.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.940
In other words, they didn't have to allow him to publish the thing at all.

22:12.120 --> 22:17.320
They just said, go ahead, sure, you know, the book 500 copies is okay.

22:18.200 --> 22:25.400
So it's just a matter of courtesy, business courtesy between the two publishers,

22:25.820 --> 22:32.900
and Tim agreed to delay his publishing until their book hit the stand.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.060
In other words, there won't be any differences at all in the two editions then?

22:38.320 --> 22:41.020
No, there's no differences. They're the same text.

22:41.820 --> 22:49.580
It's just that, no, there's just no differences.

22:49.900 --> 23:05.700
It's just that one is hardcover, it's got a beautiful, it's got a different cover, and it's signed, but the text is the same.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.080
I didn't write two books, no.

23:08.900 --> 23:09.840
No way.

23:11.960 --> 23:17.540
Okay, listen, how long have you been planning Lion-S? Is that a pretty recent plan, or did you go way back with that?

23:18.100 --> 23:24.240
Well, oddly enough, I had that thing in my mind ever since I've been 12 years old.

23:25.140 --> 23:26.520
That kind of a story.

23:28.340 --> 23:35.080
It wasn't like Lion-S, or it wasn't plotted out this way, but...

23:36.640 --> 23:47.380
But I had that mood with the idea of the story taking place in and around this forest, and with these kind of people.

23:49.420 --> 23:58.680
And the fact that I even started writing some stories about that when I was just a little kid, 12, 14, I don't know how old I was.

23:59.340 --> 24:01.420
They got thrown away, I don't know what happened in the end, please.

24:02.340 --> 24:17.600
But then I tell you the truth, I just forgot about it over the years, and then recently I decided I'd try to book along these lines.

24:18.600 --> 24:35.440
And I instantly thought of this construction, or this background which I developed back when I was so little, you know, back so long ago.

24:37.340 --> 24:47.800
And that's where the thing, I will say, ultimately derives there, because it's certainly just a kind of a notion that all the flesh out of it is recent.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.900
But anyway, that's more or less what happened.

24:53.340 --> 25:03.160
Okay, I know you have a great deal of, maybe not actual history, but legend, established legend dealing with the Irish and English and so forth.

25:03.160 --> 25:08.260
How much in your estimation was actual history a legend that she uses as a framework?

25:08.820 --> 25:27.100
Well, the Irish and the English and the Welsh have all in their folklore speak of these islands off the coast of English, south of England.

25:27.100 --> 25:36.020
They call them High Brazil, H-Y-I-F-B-R-A-S-I-D-L, High Brazil.

25:38.260 --> 25:52.280
And this is fairly, I haven't read that old much reading in the original sources by the means.

25:59.240 --> 26:04.380
But it's fairly clear that these things are just legends without any basis of fact.

26:05.860 --> 26:10.600
The people of oceanographers have studied the ocean floor.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.240
Out in this area here they find no signs of any submerged islands or anything of this sort.

26:17.240 --> 26:24.520
They're primarily looking for Atlantis, which is of course Atlantis is much, the site of Atlantis is much farther than south.

26:25.420 --> 26:39.300
Atlantis is supposed to be off Gibraltar, near to where, well there's nothing out there now, but it's between the Azores and Gibraltar.

26:40.190 --> 26:46.440
But these elder isles would be about where I've placed them.

26:46.840 --> 27:01.360
There's always been these references to Avalon in the, the, the lost city east, YS, has been placed, this is more or less for the French folklore.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.420
This has been off the coast of Cornwall generally speaking, in the French literature.

27:06.420 --> 27:11.420
But I took some liberties there and I put it on the other side of the elder isles.

27:11.420 --> 27:34.720
Leon S is, again, lost Leon S is the subject I believe of, well I think Debussy wrote a, I think Debussy wrote a piece called The Sunken Cathedral.

27:35.580 --> 27:42.520
So Cathedral was supposed to be the Cathedral of Los Leonesa City, and that was supposed

27:42.520 --> 27:43.980
to be off Cornwall somewhere.

27:45.820 --> 27:54.860
But there isn't any, any firm or definite references really that you could point to

27:54.860 --> 27:56.560
and say, here is the geography.

27:57.760 --> 28:04.200
The geography is something which I took some liberties to, mainly on the basis of these

28:04.200 --> 28:06.140
references to the island of High Brazil.

28:07.260 --> 28:13.060
And I called, I removed the, well, just called the island of Hybris, which you'll notice

28:13.060 --> 28:13.480
in a minute.

28:15.660 --> 28:20.300
Yeah, okay, I think I know the answer to this, but maybe if you do clarify it, the, the which,

28:20.500 --> 28:23.800
I think it's pronounced as May, changes into three things.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.220
Melanxi was the first, the third was burned.

28:27.720 --> 28:31.040
And I guess the second one was, was Carfilio, right?

28:31.940 --> 28:39.740
Well, there's two, yeah, there's three, there were three products for, but then I don't

28:39.740 --> 28:44.940
really want to discuss, this is something you have to read and derive for yourself.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.160
This is something that the author shouldn't have to explain.

28:50.540 --> 28:58.020
But there, there were three products from that, from the destruction of the which does

28:58.020 --> 28:59.080
may, yes, there were.

28:59.740 --> 29:03.260
And it's all, as I recall, stated there pretty categorically what happened.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.380
Yeah, no, I think it was too.

29:06.560 --> 29:06.700
Okay.

29:08.260 --> 29:12.280
Okay, you put book one on the title page of Lien S. I assume then you have a good deal

29:12.280 --> 29:13.540
more material regarding that.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.040
True.

29:17.280 --> 29:21.320
I'm, I'm working on it, working on it right now, matter of fact.

29:21.320 --> 29:29.880
Actually, I'm not, I'm kind of assembling it, but I'm also doing, I'm doing something

29:29.880 --> 29:36.420
on another book at the moment that I've got a contract for and I've got to get out.

29:36.920 --> 29:44.920
I've just finished a, a Krugel book, which is a, I'd call it a sequel if you like, to

29:44.920 --> 29:50.080
a book called Eyes of the Overworld, which is not, again, not my title.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.860
I didn't call it that, but some editor decided that was a good name.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.080
They used it.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.320
So I've finished that, that'll be out in November.

30:00.420 --> 30:03.720
Then I've got this thing I've worked on now, I've got to get out.

30:04.420 --> 30:11.880
Then after that's out, then I'll do number two, and if I get good profit contracts, I'll

30:11.880 --> 30:13.380
do number three at the same time.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.440
I guess, in other words, it's all kind of up in the air.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.560
I have to wait and see if the publisher says, publishes his Vance.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.860
That book was a disaster.

30:26.040 --> 30:31.020
I just want to see no more of it, and I'll stop writing it, but I don't think so.

30:31.260 --> 30:31.720
Hope not anyway.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.200
Mr. Vance is the, the new Krugel book.

30:36.460 --> 30:41.020
Is it a sequel to Eyes of the Overworld, or is it a sequel to A Quest for Symbolus?

30:41.120 --> 30:43.500
And will A Quest for Symbolus...

30:43.500 --> 30:46.140
No, that quest for Symbolus has got nothing to do with me.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.840
Right, but it was Krugel and...

30:49.840 --> 30:52.480
Well, that's Michael Shae's book.

30:52.820 --> 30:54.560
No, I never even read the thing.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.360
No, um...

30:56.360 --> 30:57.120
That answers the question.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.940
The, the, uh...

31:00.940 --> 31:04.360
My book is a sequel to The Original Eyes of the Overworld.

31:05.020 --> 31:08.660
What's the title of this new Krugel one going to be?

31:08.740 --> 31:09.360
Does it have one yet?

31:09.360 --> 31:18.640
Uh, if I'm not mistaken, Dave Hartwell of Simon and Schuster, I think he's, again, calling it title, I don't like very much.

31:18.720 --> 31:24.480
I think he's calling it the Krugel Sega S-A-G-A, which I don't think is a good title, and that...

31:25.080 --> 31:29.980
Writers don't have an awful lot of clout when it comes to deciding what the title's going to be.

31:30.880 --> 31:34.180
But that'll be the name, just at present, that's the name.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.500
It'll be out in November, as I mentioned.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.860
Is it too early to tell how Lee and S is selling?

31:40.820 --> 31:45.380
I hear it's selling pretty good, but I don't know exactly how good.

31:46.380 --> 31:50.960
I've just heard here and there, you know, that seems to be selling pretty good.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.920
How does it seem to be selling down your... into the woods?

31:54.900 --> 31:55.820
Yeah, pretty well.

31:55.920 --> 32:01.400
We were just at a convention, AggieCon, in College Station, Texas, and the copies they had there, they sold.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.980
The ones that, I guess, were hot off the press had been sold.

32:03.980 --> 32:08.040
And we bought the Underwood Miller copies here, two of us have.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.080
Uh-huh.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.900
Listen, I was going to pass along some information about Mexico.

32:12.100 --> 32:12.540
Are you still going?

32:13.080 --> 32:18.060
Well, yeah, I'd sure like to, if I could get enough time together.

32:18.840 --> 32:24.100
I had a friend who was just down there, and he said the exchange rate is $148 to a dollar,

32:24.180 --> 32:26.160
and you'd get some fantastic bargains and everything.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.440
Where did the exchange at, at the border, or in Mexico?

32:30.980 --> 32:31.880
Down in Mexico.

32:32.180 --> 32:36.180
I think he went to Chihuahua City mostly is where he was, and he did the exchange down there.

32:36.440 --> 32:36.880
Uh-huh.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.720
But he said the fantastic bargains, food, lodging, everything.

32:39.940 --> 32:40.180
Yeah.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.160
So if you go down there, you ought to have a good time with the money, anyhow.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.040
Yeah.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.580
I'd like to go down to Chihuahua and take that train over to the coast.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.060
You heard about that?

32:49.120 --> 32:49.680
Yeah, oh yeah.

32:51.060 --> 32:51.940
That's great trip.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.600
Copper Canyon, I think it's called.

32:53.640 --> 32:54.840
Yeah, they call it Copper Canyon.

32:55.100 --> 32:55.260
Yeah.

32:55.980 --> 32:57.340
Well, listen, Mr. Vance, I'm done with you.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.380
I'm going to turn you over to David here.

32:58.380 --> 33:00.880
He's got a favor to ask you, but I appreciate very much your time.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.860
And we're looking forward to your future books.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.620
And just a second now, David wants to ask you one thing before you go.

33:06.960 --> 33:07.240
All right.

33:08.400 --> 33:12.140
Okay, Mr. Vance, it doesn't look like we're going to make it out to any of the cons in

33:12.140 --> 33:13.600
the West Coast anytime soon.

33:13.680 --> 33:18.340
And I was wondering if we, a few of us here at the radio show might send you some books

33:18.340 --> 33:21.840
in the mail for you to sign and get you to return them if we put return postage in there.

33:24.860 --> 33:28.120
Well, I've had so damn much trouble doing that.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.000
You know, that it's trouble for my wife, really.

33:31.640 --> 33:36.320
She's had so much agony going through that, signing books, taking them to the post office,

33:36.560 --> 33:41.560
and then people not sending enough postage that I just kind of decided I wasn't going to do that anymore.

33:41.840 --> 33:47.620
I don't mean to be churlish about it, but it just makes a god damn much worth around here,

33:47.740 --> 33:47.900
is it?

33:48.540 --> 33:48.720
This?

33:50.300 --> 33:52.780
Well, I'll make an exception just once more.

33:52.960 --> 33:53.660
But you make sure.

33:54.780 --> 33:56.420
Damn well sure you got enough postage.

33:57.080 --> 33:57.520
Okay?

33:58.140 --> 33:59.200
Oh, no problem.

33:59.420 --> 34:00.760
We'll send...

34:00.760 --> 34:01.940
And get all the return.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.820
In other words, I don't mind doing this much.

34:04.920 --> 34:09.100
If I don't have to scroll around and find all the stuff to send it back here.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.200
Now, we got that down to a science.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.860
You'll just stick the label on, stick the stamps on, and dump it back in the mail.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.320
Then there's no problem.

34:18.020 --> 34:21.220
But I've had time and time again people send stuff here.

34:23.780 --> 34:26.220
And it's just cause no end to problems.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.360
But if you make it easy, then I don't mind doing it.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.640
I certainly don't mind signing your books right now.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.960
Okay, now we've done this quite a bit because it's kind of hard.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.880
If you know where we are, we're in the middle of absolutely nowhere.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.140
And it's hard to get out to some cons.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.360
So we've found that this works probably easiest for us.

34:43.440 --> 34:46.900
Where is Odessa in connection with, say, El Paso?

34:46.900 --> 34:55.200
If you draw a line between El Paso and Dallas, that line would be nearly 400 miles long.

34:55.660 --> 34:58.080
Right in the middle of that line is Odessa.

34:58.320 --> 34:58.660
I see.

34:59.760 --> 35:04.560
Cause we're just thinking, just if we have some friends in New Mexico,

35:05.180 --> 35:11.100
chances are conceivable that we might drive down through El Paso down into Chihuahua.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.360
Yeah, it's going out through Oroes and whatnot.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.660
That's a pretty common route, yeah.

35:15.660 --> 35:16.040
Yeah.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.840
Although, I don't know, it's a long, long way.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.680
Yeah, I myself, I've never been to Mexico.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.240
I really hadn't thought about it, but with the exchange rate the way it is,

35:25.300 --> 35:27.160
it seems like it would be quite the time.

35:27.300 --> 35:29.940
It's a shame not taking advantage of it.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.400
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.

35:31.820 --> 35:34.300
I might change my summer vacation plans here.

35:34.980 --> 35:36.080
How many people in your class?

35:36.800 --> 35:39.400
There are about 25 people in the class.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.820
What are their ages, right?

35:41.720 --> 35:45.780
Or ages run anywhere from 18 to the early 30s?

35:45.860 --> 35:46.600
Uh-huh, yeah.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.320
Yeah, you were pretty right on the mark on your answer back there when you were,

35:50.400 --> 35:51.980
when they were asking about the dying earth.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.160
Yeah, yeah, I hate to talk about that.

35:55.260 --> 36:00.140
That seems to be, you know, it's something that, since it was all right,

36:00.300 --> 36:05.580
but that's so long ago, you know, I hate to be waste no time talking about that thing

36:05.580 --> 36:11.360
when I've got a lot of other stuff since then that I think deserves more comment than that thing.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.340
But it's all right, I'm not putting it down.

36:13.580 --> 36:15.700
Why should I, you know, make money for me?

36:16.220 --> 36:22.080
Yeah, yeah, I think what it is, it's been around for such an amount of time

36:22.080 --> 36:25.680
that it's really getting in the air of being sort of a classic.

36:25.940 --> 36:26.780
Yeah, that's right.

36:26.980 --> 36:29.740
You know, kind of like Bradbury's something wicked this way comes.

36:29.940 --> 36:31.720
You know, we've taught them all both books

36:31.720 --> 36:33.920
and we tend to look at them in the same light.

36:36.180 --> 36:39.120
You may just be burdened with having a classic on your hands.

36:39.260 --> 36:44.860
Well, as long as, as long as it doesn't cost me money, I don't mind.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.400
No, I don't, I don't work the other way around.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.700
Well, no, I'm just joking.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.220
Yeah, yeah.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.040
Are you going to World Fantasy Con this next year?

36:53.360 --> 36:53.560
No.

36:53.940 --> 36:54.280
Okay.

36:54.460 --> 36:59.180
I don't go to any con connections unless I get a big red carpet laid out from year to there

37:00.460 --> 37:06.760
with maidens, with fans along the way and people offering me beer at every ten steps.

37:08.300 --> 37:09.140
You know, that kind of stuff.

37:09.400 --> 37:13.960
If you get offered a con like that, could you let us know we might just want to come watch?

37:17.200 --> 37:22.740
Well, I generally don't even go to any conventions in the States too, with exceptions,

37:22.740 --> 37:31.140
but I like to go to foreign conventions because I, you know, I get to travel four and three,

37:31.780 --> 37:35.780
although I find that it costs me just about as much as it would if I was paying my own way.

37:36.460 --> 37:41.360
Well, not quite, but I generally don't go to conventions in the States at all.

37:42.580 --> 37:46.260
I just generally, generally outside the States.

37:48.060 --> 37:50.940
Last year with that Australia, that was a lot of fun.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.060
And that's the way it goes.

37:55.960 --> 37:59.380
Okay, well listen, Mr. Vance, we appreciate you taking time out to talk with us and everything

37:59.380 --> 38:01.700
and the guys in the class really did appreciate it.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.260
I don't know.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.580
I'm happy to help you and your work.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.360
Give me a call if you have any other problems.

38:08.740 --> 38:09.880
Okay, okay, we appreciate it.

38:09.900 --> 38:13.480
We'll be in touch and we'll send you those books and we'll make sure to send enough return postage and everything.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.220
All right, period.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.220
Okay, thank you again, sir.

38:15.220 --> 38:16.240
Bye-bye.
