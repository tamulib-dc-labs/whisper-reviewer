00:01.100 --> 00:02.880
The tape is now on.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.100
Okay.

00:05.700 --> 00:11.840
In the early to middle 1960s, the so-called New Wave hit science fiction,

00:12.560 --> 00:15.820
what did you think of it then and did it have any influence on your style?

00:17.180 --> 00:22.080
I, in the previous tape I was completely confused by the New Wave.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.280
Um, is it been going for some time because before I was aware of what it was,

00:29.280 --> 00:34.600
I had read some stories that seemed very strange to me.

00:37.340 --> 00:41.680
And then I finally became, you see I was very well isolated.

00:41.900 --> 00:48.840
I was almost, because I was close to, I had to keep close to newspaper work,

00:48.980 --> 00:50.680
I never got very far away from home.

00:50.760 --> 00:57.540
I was almost never in New York where the real format of the, of the, of all going on.

00:57.540 --> 01:09.940
Um, but I didn't get as angry or as contentious over the New Wave as many writers did.

01:10.960 --> 01:18.440
I felt sure that it was just one of the evolutionary things that do happen occasionally in science fiction,

01:19.060 --> 01:21.960
and indeed in any form of literature.

01:22.680 --> 01:31.520
Um, I felt certain that the New Wave as such would die out after time,

01:32.660 --> 01:40.940
and I hoped that it would have some beneficial impact on, on science fiction, science fiction writing.

01:41.740 --> 01:43.560
And in fact it did.

01:44.420 --> 01:49.880
I think that after reading some of the materials, especially that that came out of Britain,

01:51.120 --> 02:00.060
that I began to feel that there might be room for somewhat better writing than some of us had been doing, myself and Cudin.

02:01.200 --> 02:10.240
And apparently a number of other people, whether influenced by the New Wave or not, apparently that's the same thing.

02:11.220 --> 02:19.260
Uh, because I think that from the time shorter around the time the New Wave was beginning to die out,

02:20.100 --> 02:29.500
that you did begin to see a far more attention to good writing than there had ever been before in science fiction fields.

02:31.360 --> 02:37.360
So science fiction survived the New Wave and benefited from it.

02:37.960 --> 02:46.940
And I suspect that in the years to come there'll be other innovations, other evolutionary factors

02:47.780 --> 02:53.220
that will be called not New Wave but something else that may raise a great deal of controversy

02:53.220 --> 02:58.440
with that participation in keep on and probably will benefit by all of that.

03:01.420 --> 03:05.000
You continue to produce both novels and short stories.

03:06.060 --> 03:14.800
Um, I do story a few short stories and my almost entire, all my time has taken up with novels.

03:16.020 --> 03:22.940
Although I hope that within the next few years, that I'll be able to write more short stories,

03:24.240 --> 03:28.400
there's nothing quite as satisfactory as writing good short stories.

03:29.040 --> 03:38.680
You can't spend the time and all the effort on making a novel shine the way you can make a short story shine.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.080
You can polish it up, you can clean it just like a gem.

03:43.260 --> 03:45.180
It was a novel, you can't do that.

03:46.700 --> 03:56.700
So I'm pleased, particularly, to see a number of the magazines hanging in there

03:57.680 --> 04:05.960
because we are giving, we are giving young writers a chance to begin their writing career

04:05.960 --> 04:11.740
and to polish up the art before they go on to something longer, into the book market, for example.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.080
When you write, what are the mechanics of your writing?

04:18.560 --> 04:22.400
Have you bought a word processor? Do you still write it out or type it or what?

04:24.400 --> 04:36.480
I write it by wrong hand because I, my hand blows slower writing wrong hand than it would on a typewriter.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.320
I write too fast, I get ahead of myself on a typewriter.

04:40.680 --> 04:49.100
By writing wrong hand, I can keep pace with my mind and I do a better job of writing in wrong hand.

04:50.660 --> 04:54.940
When I've finished with, when I've written two chapters in all games,

04:56.100 --> 05:03.440
by then I run them to a typewriter, making changes and selections and revisions.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.480
When I go along, that is my finished copy.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.160
That's the second I've finally read.

05:10.160 --> 05:10.380
What's your draft?

05:16.340 --> 05:21.660
You've won the major awards, including the very recent one for the short story.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.800
The one I want to ask you about is the Grandmaster Nebula.

05:26.260 --> 05:31.280
I would think that it would be very gratifying to receive award of this stature from your peers,

05:31.880 --> 05:33.480
not from the fans, but from your peers.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.160
That was, I had never expected to get it.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.960
It's very pleased to get it.

05:42.200 --> 05:52.460
It is, it is a recognition of your standing as an author, by the people who themselves are authors.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.900
Yes, it doesn't, it doesn't depend on popularity.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.620
It doesn't depend on momentary success.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.300
It depends on the represent the lifetime achievements.

06:05.300 --> 06:13.080
And it's read by people who are well-filed writers.

06:14.140 --> 06:18.720
It was extremely, extremely pleased. I'm very proud of it.

06:20.860 --> 06:27.480
When you started writing science fiction in the 1930s, did you dream that your work would last

06:27.480 --> 06:33.500
and that your work in science fiction in general would reach the level of popularity that it seems to enjoy now?

06:34.380 --> 06:37.840
Not at all. Never for a moment. We were working in a ghetto.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.140
There were very few of us.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.700
Science fiction was read by only a handful.

06:49.420 --> 06:54.540
When you met somebody and they found out you were a science fiction writer, they'd say,

06:54.620 --> 06:56.260
how to get such crazy ideas.

06:57.100 --> 07:01.020
I was thinking around hoping nobody would notice you.

07:03.060 --> 07:07.840
You were the bottom of the heap. There's no question about it.

07:08.660 --> 07:15.420
You were much more despicable than maybe the pornographic writers of today.

07:17.180 --> 07:20.580
But we kept at it because we liked it.

07:20.580 --> 07:30.980
Because I think after a few years of it, I began to feel that probably it would develop into my head of teacher.

07:32.980 --> 07:43.800
But I never think that we would be putting out as great and suitable progress as we have.

07:44.700 --> 07:54.460
A large percentage of the fiction titles that I saw today are science fiction.

07:55.400 --> 08:02.660
And science fiction is beginning to dominate both the movie screen and the television.

08:04.320 --> 08:11.240
We are writing the quest of a way and I hope this quest continues to rise.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.800
I see no reason why it should.

08:17.180 --> 08:24.000
Do you manage to read any science fiction or any other fiction in between all your writing, John?

08:25.480 --> 08:31.080
I read some science fiction. I try to keep up with science fiction.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.400
I try to...

08:33.400 --> 08:37.820
This is possible to read all science fiction that is being put out.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.740
I think you get total vision if you did.

08:43.260 --> 08:46.500
You get a good many confusing signals if you did.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.640
I read lots of information.

08:54.380 --> 09:03.700
I am a history buff with emphasis on the Civil War and the settlement of our country.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.700
And I have a few favorite authors.

09:09.980 --> 09:14.760
Steinbeck, coming way, Thomas Lewis.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.280
I read over and over again.

09:20.320 --> 09:34.660
I have had a post on my desk some way way back and very a week goes past.

09:34.860 --> 09:40.660
I don't read a few pages of post simply for the beautiful writing of the man dead.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.180
Is that correct?

09:49.240 --> 09:49.720
Yes.

09:51.480 --> 10:00.980
You mentioned way back when we were talking about the city stories that you got disillusioned with the plight of man.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.860
You alluded to it a couple of other times.

10:05.140 --> 10:11.960
How do you view technology and man's place in it and what man's future is going to be with all this technology?

10:17.560 --> 10:19.760
That's a hard one.

10:20.200 --> 10:25.980
I think that we have become octagists to technologies.

10:26.900 --> 10:32.760
That we are using technology to dehumanize ourselves.

10:36.200 --> 10:50.160
I understand and admit that we must have higher and never higher technology to make ourselves to make possible a better life.

10:53.040 --> 10:59.840
After all, medical technology has saved many lives.

11:00.040 --> 11:10.120
I can remember the time when diseases, not chickenpox, dipteria were cherished.

11:20.520 --> 11:25.460
We still have heart disease and we have cancer, but one of these days we are going to look at that.

11:26.700 --> 11:31.460
We have a make-up, wage, and communication.

11:34.340 --> 11:42.520
We now can listen to stars, thousands of white-years-distance millions of white-years-distance millions.

11:43.400 --> 11:53.560
We have gone out to most of the planets in the solar system in the last few years.

11:54.560 --> 12:01.960
One of our unmanned folks would be going out and entering space beyond some resources.

12:03.560 --> 12:17.720
All of this is fine and it's necessary, but I do visit things that we are being overwhelmed by technology.

12:19.020 --> 12:29.540
I am considerably uncomfortable with the electronics that are getting the computers.

12:30.840 --> 12:41.680
I can see the day when we will abolish money and that we do all our business by computers.

12:46.840 --> 12:55.600
It's hurting us. It's going to hurt some and still you can't expect technology because of those things.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.300
You can see it, I'm confused.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.560
I don't think you're the only one.

13:03.940 --> 13:07.460
You were one of the few who would admit it, but I think you're the only one.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.900
We're back off from being so heavy now.

13:11.480 --> 13:17.560
Looking back on your body of works, what are some of your favorite works that you've done?

13:21.720 --> 13:27.280
Most people, if you ask what my favorite work was, would say city.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.140
I'm pleased that most people would say that.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.080
But I think that I have written better works than city.

13:41.020 --> 13:53.020
I think this way station, choice of thoughts, maybe project hope are among my better works.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.120
The visitors was a good story.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.320
It's hard to say which work you think is best.

14:05.360 --> 14:14.840
Even after seven years after I've written, I'm still puzzled by which pieces work I do think is my best effort.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.540
How do you want to be remembered as a writer?

14:27.620 --> 14:30.180
I don't know if I will be remembered.

14:31.380 --> 14:41.240
But if I am to be remembered as a writer, I'd like to remember that someone who wrote honestly

14:43.160 --> 14:50.800
and who is hard to share with a heart's mind that humanities and humanities achievement.

14:57.580 --> 15:00.940
That seems like a good place, Dan, but I want to ask you one more question.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.320
What do you have in the works?

15:04.860 --> 15:08.780
Should we expect to see a couple of books a year out of you now for a while or what?

15:09.860 --> 15:12.360
You must realize that I'm getting old.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.720
My good health has partially deserted me.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.000
I don't type as straight as I have before.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.420
I still write almost every day.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.820
That's how I can do some work, but I don't do as much as I used to.

15:33.800 --> 15:40.440
I think that the two books a year is at an end and probably should be satisfied with one book a year.

15:41.280 --> 15:49.720
In September, a new book, A Minor Fantasy, where David Wells will be put out by Delray,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.500
I'd rather work to St. Pargus.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.260
I'm somewhat better halfway through it.

16:02.620 --> 16:04.840
Mr. Simac, we look forward to a lot more.

16:05.640 --> 16:10.800
I would hope that I could give you a lot more. I'm going to do the best I can.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.400
How does this all sound?

16:14.040 --> 16:17.620
This sounded great. It's really been nice.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.540
How does it record? You have no way of knowing how to record.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.340
The recording is fine. The engineer can listen to the recording while we're talking.

16:25.340 --> 16:27.420
He says it sounds fine.

16:28.620 --> 16:33.060
It sounds like your cold deserted you at least for a little while.

16:33.360 --> 16:39.240
The cold is all gone. I haven't got it yet.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.480
It's just beginning to seek up on me.

16:42.640 --> 16:49.300
If I can take enough aspirin and drink enough orange juice, I may skin past well.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.040
I'm a firm believer in vitamin C, so I'll prescribe that for you.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.940
I think it works.

16:59.840 --> 17:00.640
That is it.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.380
It's pretty much good.

17:01.740 --> 17:03.880
Mr. Simac?

17:05.320 --> 17:06.320
This is David Carson.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.000
I was listening in there.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.740
I don't think I'd worry about not being remembered.

17:11.840 --> 17:16.820
I think some of your works are extremely memorable and will be around for as long as words are in print.

17:19.260 --> 17:20.820
Thank you very much.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.460
Mr. Simac, we sure appreciate the chance to get to interview you.

17:24.820 --> 17:29.260
As I said, when we make the shows, we'll get you copies of the manual note.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.420
You'll see what you sound like.

17:31.740 --> 17:33.120
I appreciate it.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.140
There were small groups sitting around to understand the city.

17:39.780 --> 17:42.780
I want to say hello to them and thank them for being there.

17:42.780 --> 17:43.760
Thank you.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.120
Nice talking to you, Mr. Simac. Good night now.
