WEBVTT

00:03.912 --> 00:05.694
a man named Robert Boyle at Joshua.

00:06.856 --> 00:11.622
And he just studied other books at Yale.

00:11.642 --> 00:13.705
He was a brilliant choice in his own right.

00:14.486 --> 00:17.590
And I just began to do it.

00:18.391 --> 00:20.154
I hadn't read anything quite like it.

00:20.174 --> 00:23.398
I read a lot of different people that I had never read.

00:24.039 --> 00:29.166
And then, of course, Ulysses just took me into another world.

00:29.186 --> 00:30.848
I mean, I didn't realize that he could do it.

00:31.604 --> 00:59.704
I want you to think about, for our next talk about, I read where you are the perfect man for this job, that you were made for H.I.C.

01:00.764 --> 01:02.286
I don't know about that.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.589
There are a lot of common threads here.

01:06.311 --> 01:13.440
They wanted a scholar, a scholar who worked in the field with the HRC straight strengths, where it would make sense.

01:14.461 --> 01:17.865
They want somebody who had had academic responsibilities.

01:17.885 --> 01:22.010
I've been a provost from the dean, and they want somebody who knew the book world.

01:22.411 --> 01:24.634
I've been in the book world for 25 years.

01:24.654 --> 01:27.537
I think there's kind of a dynamism that's expected here.

01:27.557 --> 01:28.038
Probably.

01:28.618 --> 01:29.860
Yes, I think that's true.

01:30.127 --> 01:31.449
I think that's true.

01:31.509 --> 01:34.292
I mean, because you were very successful at Tulsa, I guess.

01:34.873 --> 01:36.895
It went well then.

01:37.236 --> 01:39.078
Well, we'll talk tomorrow.

01:39.098 --> 01:39.579
We sure will.

01:39.659 --> 01:40.079
Thank you.

01:40.260 --> 01:40.800
I appreciate it.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.665
Tom, please.

01:44.685 --> 01:55.519
Doctor, I'm writing a book for Random House on some of the great book collections and collectors that we put together over a period of 400 years.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.142
Half the book will be history and half

01:59.050 --> 02:05.557
is contemporary, and one of the major institutions I'm studying is Texas and the HRC.

02:06.498 --> 02:11.684
And as I understand it, you have really a great collection of theater arts.

02:13.106 --> 02:13.306
Yes.

02:13.406 --> 02:14.748
Anywhere, perhaps.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.711
There certainly are in the area.

02:18.332 --> 02:28.483
Posters and design art and photographs, and not so much buying the script material of theater,

02:31.163 --> 02:35.848
Lots of original artwork.

02:35.868 --> 02:38.131
How long have you been here, Doctor?

02:38.151 --> 02:49.364
Well, I started working in September of 65, right after the fire in the tower.

02:49.384 --> 03:01.137
See, we started when the theater arts library started with the two floors on the tower, and nobody believed how much

03:02.213 --> 03:06.478
how many things were crowded in the two floors.

03:07.500 --> 03:17.292
So, we got here in the short of space the day we arrived.

03:20.576 --> 03:27.985
Our first two big collections were the Albert Davis and Miss McCandle.

03:31.475 --> 03:41.789
The Albert Davis collection was started in around 1874 in Mr. Davis's boyhood.

03:42.631 --> 03:57.211
He waylaid Edwin Booth and said, asked him for a photograph, and Booth said, well, see my business manager, he'll be glad to give you one.

03:57.231 --> 04:00.115
Mr. Davis says, but I don't want one of those.

04:06.102 --> 04:10.108
The board found what he liked.

04:10.348 --> 04:11.530
That's a great story.

04:11.550 --> 04:14.654
And Booth's son gave it to him.

04:14.674 --> 04:15.475
Was this in New York?

04:16.937 --> 04:17.879
Probably.

04:18.059 --> 04:21.644
Edwin Booth's home is now the Players Club in New York.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.565
I know.

04:22.585 --> 04:25.129
It's quite a wonderful place.

04:25.730 --> 04:30.056
Have you been involved in the acquisition of materials?

04:30.076 --> 04:30.296
Yes.

04:30.336 --> 04:30.977
Deciding?

04:32.319 --> 04:35.704
What's your focus been in terms of deciding?

04:36.072 --> 04:40.917
what materials you wanted to get, I wonder.

04:40.937 --> 04:47.224
Could you just give me a overview of... Well, for one thing, I'm a costume buff.

04:48.726 --> 04:50.227
Really?

04:50.247 --> 04:59.817
So, well, I've got lots of costume designs and set designs.

04:59.837 --> 05:05.944
Could you name some of the principal figures, Dr. Crane, who are represented in that collection?

05:06.143 --> 05:20.019
Well, Eleconda Benoit, and of course we had the Norman Bel Geddes collection when I came.

05:20.619 --> 05:29.790
Also, our latest big costume acquisition was the B.J.

05:29.950 --> 05:32.573
Simmons company.

05:33.346 --> 05:34.789
How do you store these?

05:34.969 --> 05:39.117
Are these stored here in this facility, or do you have room storage?

05:40.399 --> 05:45.870
No, the Simmons is in the flat box.

05:45.910 --> 05:52.823
It's out here at 29,000.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.984
Is this something we could take a look at, do you think?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.588
How do scholars make use of these?

06:01.108 --> 06:05.353
How would 29,000 costume designers assist the scholar?

06:07.235 --> 06:15.324
Well, they've been showing how things were, how shows were dressed.

06:15.344 --> 06:17.847
And it's important to preserve them, number one, I guess.

06:17.867 --> 06:23.653
And, well, costume students come up here.

06:24.393 --> 06:34.747
But those date from around the 1880s to around the 1960s.

06:36.610 --> 06:43.700
Most of the, a great deal of it is in the 20s and 30s.

06:44.060 --> 06:51.871
You see, they even custom some Belasco shows.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.033
Really?

06:53.789 --> 06:57.934
And there are some movie designs as well.

06:57.954 --> 06:59.696
The movie designs are very interesting.

06:59.716 --> 07:04.261
Now, these are actually the designs as they appear on paper, not these.

07:04.462 --> 07:08.366
You don't have any of the artifacts from the actual sets, do you?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.470
Well, no.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.234
We do have some costumes.

07:15.535 --> 07:22.783
Of course, there are the famous five from Gone with the Wind.

07:23.101 --> 07:51.840
And we have, well, we started collecting a few costumes with about eight costumes from the Diaglos era.

07:52.060 --> 07:52.180
Right.

07:53.138 --> 07:59.908
Five from Narcissus and three from The Life of the Plane.

08:01.310 --> 08:15.872
And the Joffrey Ballet Company got some drawings of those costumes for their recreation.

08:15.892 --> 08:21.861
So this is really quite an extensive collection here.

08:22.182 --> 08:22.302
It is.

08:23.243 --> 08:32.734
We have a large collection of 18th and early 19th century English playbills.

08:32.754 --> 08:37.740
Drury Lane, Southern Garden, and Haymarket.

08:37.760 --> 08:45.249
Are these purchased from dealers or at auction or gifts or whatever, right?

08:45.269 --> 08:47.672
Some of them are given, some we buy.

08:48.753 --> 08:53.098
We haven't been able to buy an awful lot because

08:53.821 --> 09:10.877
Well, I got those costumes on fluke.

09:13.139 --> 09:23.389
Marina Henderson got them in a collection and she wrote John Bolt here.

09:24.854 --> 09:28.680
on the Slavic Lang with his faculty.

09:28.700 --> 09:39.676
And somehow other than Pam's letter came to the HRC, and theyâ€”so it was about costumes and sent it to me.

09:40.737 --> 09:50.552
And I phoned John Bolton and asked him if he was interested in these costumes, and he said, well, I'm interested in their bringing taxes.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.658
So I got them.

09:56.191 --> 10:06.202
Then I got a few more ballet costumes.

10:06.222 --> 10:12.128
I got a costume from one of the four albums.

10:12.328 --> 10:15.191
Did you know Dr. Ransom well when he was there?

10:15.452 --> 10:17.794
Not really well.

10:17.854 --> 10:20.597
No, I did know him.

10:20.637 --> 10:26.063
I wonder whatâ€”I guess he provided the inspiration for all of this.

10:26.431 --> 10:37.802
collecting activity, and I wonder if you could give me some sense of how he inspired you people, or what the mandate was.

10:37.822 --> 10:44.629
You just mentioned earlier that, well, there's no money now to buy things, but apparently there was money then to buy things.

10:44.969 --> 10:45.950
Yeah.

10:45.970 --> 10:51.696
I wonder what the attitude was around, well, another wonderful golden days,

10:57.194 --> 11:05.328
Well, he had quite a following.

11:05.348 --> 11:12.600
I mean, he came up through the ranks of the English department.

11:18.951 --> 11:23.218
I didn't know him well, and I didn't know what was behind it.

11:23.671 --> 11:27.875
I didn't come on the same year until 65.

11:29.717 --> 11:40.929
And he just knew who to talk to and what to say to them.

11:41.590 --> 11:46.135
In terms of people in the state legislature or the regents?

11:47.136 --> 11:47.456
Both.

11:47.577 --> 11:48.077
Everyone.

11:48.297 --> 11:50.860
And donors.

11:54.755 --> 12:04.386
He was a great friend of Mr. Hummel himself.

12:04.426 --> 12:09.612
They talk often of Harry Ransom's vision.

12:09.713 --> 12:12.736
Is that a correct evaluation?

12:12.936 --> 12:17.742
Yes, I think so.

12:19.173 --> 12:30.064
He wanted an important library, and he realized that we'd never be able to catch up with the East Coast.

12:32.306 --> 12:49.163
So, he decided that the first edition of a book was just an end product, and he was going after all the material that led up to it.

12:49.649 --> 13:06.440
early on in this idea, and when these manuscripts and so forth would come on the market, he would hop in and buy them before people caught on to it.

13:06.861 --> 13:11.269
He must have had wonderful sources of information, though, because I've seen a number of cases where he

13:12.194 --> 13:16.821
He bought things before others even knew they were available, that they were being offered.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.266
I just wonder, he must have really established an extraordinary network.

13:21.688 --> 13:23.130
He must have.

13:23.310 --> 13:32.504
And as you say, he must have had this wonderful backing of people in the state, I guess, who agreed that Texas should build a great, great collection.

13:33.425 --> 13:37.872
I think what's remarkable is how it was done in such a short period of time.

13:39.394 --> 13:41.577
Do you have any thoughts on that?

13:41.810 --> 13:45.215
of such an accomplishment could have been done in such a short period of time?

13:46.337 --> 13:53.689
Not really, except, you know, the story in, I believe, the book of Great Libraries.

13:54.610 --> 13:56.573
Anthony Hobson's book, I think.

13:57.114 --> 14:04.225
About this oversleeping and going to a sail with a trench coat on over his pajamas.

14:06.549 --> 14:07.430
I haven't seen that.

14:07.470 --> 14:08.712
You know, I can't find that book.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.465
Well, we've got a few copies of it around.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.066
Is that right?

14:13.346 --> 14:14.587
I try to get it at Widener.

14:14.727 --> 14:21.414
I've been doing a lot of my research at Widener at Harvard, because we live close to Boston.

14:21.434 --> 14:25.358
And that book is, Tom Staley mentioned that I should read it.

14:25.438 --> 14:27.540
I can't find it.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.163
Well, maybe he'll lend you a copy.

14:30.183 --> 14:32.626
I think there are two or three floating around there.

14:32.646 --> 14:36.049
I wouldn't mind just getting a Xerox of that particular entry.

14:36.586 --> 14:40.853
I guess it does give a little bit of the flavor of what John did.

14:40.873 --> 14:41.053
Yeah.

14:41.995 --> 14:53.553
And he would buy the stock and trade of a bookstore.

14:54.254 --> 14:54.835
I'm sorry, what?

14:55.236 --> 14:59.623
I say he would buy the stock and trade of a bookstore if necessary.

15:03.687 --> 15:06.249
No, not quite that bad.

15:06.349 --> 15:11.153
That's the Henry Huntington syndrome, I think, where Huntington would buy entire libraries.

15:12.755 --> 15:18.900
Well, he's got a bunch of writers' libraries here.

15:19.421 --> 15:25.266
Yeah, well, those, of course, are really interesting as well.

15:26.167 --> 15:33.593
There was a store in San Antonio that provided scripts for German

15:34.720 --> 15:43.869
We have the whole stock.

15:47.373 --> 15:51.397
But you've been here from the beginning, basically.

15:51.437 --> 15:54.981
I guess 58 is when it started, but I think you came over in 65.

15:56.703 --> 16:00.947
You were here during some exciting times.

16:02.463 --> 16:03.384
Not so much.

16:04.104 --> 16:11.651
Ransom was sort of fading from the scene.

16:13.993 --> 16:20.658
The director in my days, when I started, was Warren Rodman.

16:22.040 --> 16:22.840
He's still around.

16:22.860 --> 16:23.361
He's around?

16:23.441 --> 16:29.446
Oh, yes.

16:30.006 --> 16:32.048
Can you think of anything to ask Dr. King?

16:32.602 --> 16:52.489
Dr. Crane, you just walked us into a little room, and could you describe what we're looking at here, hanging by these, they look like meat hooks, but I know that's not what they are.

16:52.950 --> 16:54.993
No, they're odd puppets.

16:55.153 --> 17:02.423
They're old characters from the Orlando Furioso.

17:02.977 --> 17:06.460
And they're Sicilian.

17:07.701 --> 17:16.129
And they were used, apparently, all of these marionettes.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.771
They just played the same thing.

17:17.791 --> 17:24.738
They made a sort of cereal out of the Orlando Furioso and played it over and over and over again.

17:25.058 --> 17:26.059
These are marionettes?

17:26.459 --> 17:26.720
Mm-hmm.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.322
So they were manipulated by strings then?

17:30.027 --> 17:32.491
Not entirely, sorry.

17:33.212 --> 17:44.550
Oh, by that, in other words, they would hold that handle and probably... Yeah, they could make them walk and sort of fight and various... Were they done on a stage, or was it like street theater, I wonder?

17:45.731 --> 17:46.713
I'm not sure.

17:46.773 --> 17:50.799
I think it was a regular theater.

17:53.043 --> 17:53.283
Uh-huh.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.927
And these are of what national origin are they again now?

17:56.348 --> 17:57.610
They're Italian.

17:57.650 --> 17:58.231
Sicilian.

17:58.251 --> 17:58.431
Sicilian.

17:58.698 --> 17:59.339
They're beautiful.

17:59.359 --> 18:07.189
There's conquistadors, and they're a knight in armor, a priest.

18:07.209 --> 18:10.152
There's a fellow with a club who looks like a caveman.

18:10.793 --> 18:13.897
Well, that is Orlando Furioso.

18:13.937 --> 18:21.246
We have one of them in armor, and one of them after he went crazy.

18:22.660 --> 18:25.043
There are probably 50 of these in here, I would estimate.

18:25.543 --> 18:26.565
No, 60.

18:26.585 --> 18:26.825
60.

18:26.845 --> 18:29.228
And these are from a single collection?

18:29.668 --> 18:30.910
And whose collection is this?

18:31.871 --> 18:42.103
Well, Mr. Stanley Marcus used this for his fortnight in Italy, in Neiman Marcus.

18:42.124 --> 18:47.430
And when the fortnight was over, he gave them to the university.

18:47.450 --> 18:49.212
That's a great story.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.655
So they were used for just a fortnight.

18:51.938 --> 18:59.608
Well, yes, they were part of the decoration.

19:00.189 --> 19:17.312
You know, every year, the Neiman Marcus used to have a fortnight in a different country, and they would decorate the whole store and have food from that particular country.

19:17.352 --> 19:20.376
So these were actually just created?

19:20.795 --> 19:22.037
Oh, no.

19:22.057 --> 19:27.325
They wereâ€”he bought them from one of these puppeteering families.

19:27.605 --> 19:27.946
I see.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.889
So how old would you say these puppets are?

19:30.790 --> 19:33.474
Well, I think they're about 125.

19:34.436 --> 19:34.716
Really?

19:34.756 --> 19:37.260
And the colors have remained just beautiful.

19:39.403 --> 19:42.388
They were restored.

19:42.488 --> 19:44.391
Here at the university?

19:44.411 --> 19:45.773
So that's, again, part of yourâ€”

19:46.023 --> 19:52.529
What you do is you don't just acquire and preserve, you also restore where necessary, such as in this case.

19:53.710 --> 20:00.716
Well, we made an awful lot of people unhappy when we restored these.

20:00.736 --> 20:02.337
I can understand.

20:02.357 --> 20:03.658
They're beautiful, though.

20:03.678 --> 20:14.528
No, we also have some turnabout puppets, you know, the Turnabout Theatre of Yale Puppet has had.

20:15.115 --> 20:17.918
We have the portrait of it.

20:18.239 --> 20:24.406
And then there areâ€” They're beautiful.

20:24.426 --> 20:25.988
These are works of art, aren't they?

20:26.008 --> 20:26.429
Did you say?

20:26.449 --> 20:28.291
Yeah.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.533
And here are some signs.

20:30.514 --> 20:36.421
Now these are just signs, I guess.

20:37.142 --> 20:38.804
I see.

20:39.164 --> 20:43.890
Oh, these identify theâ€”

20:45.035 --> 20:47.557
Yeah, look.

20:47.577 --> 20:51.421
See the canto and the .

20:51.441 --> 20:53.443
I see.

20:53.463 --> 20:56.906
Okay.

20:56.926 --> 20:58.608
That looks beautiful.

20:58.628 --> 20:59.448
You mean in back?

21:00.189 --> 21:01.110
Yes.

21:01.170 --> 21:05.054
Behind on the file cabinet.

21:05.354 --> 21:11.920
There are so many treasures here, I imagine, after a while, it's hard to move around.

21:13.638 --> 21:21.928
some models that were probably used in the, uh, uh, Chihuahua.

21:24.511 --> 21:24.691
Uh-huh.

21:24.711 --> 21:27.154
And this is a turbinosed spot.

21:27.474 --> 21:32.680
It was used in the Paramount Theater until just the recent past.

21:32.761 --> 21:33.381
Really?

21:33.882 --> 21:36.565
When I got some basic lighting equipment in.

21:37.786 --> 21:40.810
So this is kind of like a little Smithsonian in many ways, isn't it?

21:42.005 --> 21:42.566
Yes.

21:42.706 --> 21:43.667
Would you agree with that?

21:43.687 --> 21:46.632
A lot of theseâ€” Very little.

21:46.732 --> 21:49.256
Well, these are artifacts.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.539
I mean, you really can't call these library materials.

21:52.240 --> 22:02.915
No, they're moreâ€”we're a mixture of library and museum on this floor and the sixth floor, especially.

22:02.935 --> 22:07.422
The sixth floor has the photography collection.

22:09.950 --> 22:14.295
The big trunks belonged to a senior salesman.

22:14.315 --> 22:15.556
There were sample trunks.

22:15.776 --> 22:23.865
One of them held about 110 pieces of scenery painted on cardboard, leg and drop.

22:24.665 --> 22:34.956
And the other trunk had a miniature stage with complete lighting equipment and a switchboard.

22:35.257 --> 22:36.338
And what were they used for?

22:37.559 --> 22:39.501
Well, they were used toâ€”

22:40.038 --> 22:45.906
So the gas customersâ€” Oh, they were like samples.

22:45.946 --> 22:46.407
Yeah.

22:46.707 --> 22:49.591
And I see.

22:49.611 --> 22:50.052
How long ago was that?

22:50.072 --> 22:53.617
Well, it was into the 20s, I believe.

22:53.637 --> 23:05.353
He workedâ€”he worked for the Sosklin and Landis Studio in Chicago, and he dealt mainly with Scottish Rite temples.

23:05.620 --> 23:06.922
That's right.

23:06.942 --> 23:08.724
That would make a wonderful display.

23:08.744 --> 23:13.331
So if you were to open this up, all those things would be inside there right now?

23:13.351 --> 23:13.451
Yeah.

23:13.471 --> 23:14.833
Hopefully it could be outside.

23:14.853 --> 23:30.315
Yeah, and you know, he could show his scenery on our lights and take the artist and send it to the studio, and the studio would paint the scenery, build and paint the scenery, and send it back.

23:34.261 --> 23:34.902
Okay.

23:36.991 --> 23:47.865
And Doctor, are these original films, or are these... Yes, those are Carl Stanley Gardner.

23:47.965 --> 23:48.025
Oh.

23:48.045 --> 23:48.706
Perry Mason.

23:48.746 --> 23:55.975
This is all part of the Gardner archive, which is... Oh, that's... They have this whole room reproduced here someplace.

23:56.115 --> 23:57.157
I guess we have to see that.

23:57.777 --> 24:01.823
Oh, yeah, that's in... That's in the academics.

24:01.843 --> 24:02.303
Oh, is it?

24:02.423 --> 24:04.125
On the fourth floor.

24:04.306 --> 24:04.987
I see.

24:05.007 --> 24:05.327
Okay.

24:10.150 --> 24:16.377
You know everything here, don't you?

24:16.658 --> 24:17.779
Oh, look at that.

24:18.260 --> 24:21.664
Tyrone Power, Loretta Young, Annabella.

24:21.684 --> 24:24.167
These are the original paintings for posters.

24:24.187 --> 24:25.488
Can you imagine that?

24:25.568 --> 24:28.071
Oh, this is the original where they took the poster.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.815
This is the original art.

24:30.835 --> 24:32.336
So you have a collection of these, then?

24:32.957 --> 24:33.838
Just a few.

24:34.339 --> 24:39.685
Do you know how fast that would go for itself with these collections?

24:40.660 --> 24:43.583
Beautiful.

24:43.603 --> 24:44.904
Annabella was the movie.

24:44.924 --> 24:46.225
I wonder who the artist was on that.

24:46.245 --> 24:47.226
Do you know, Donald?

24:47.246 --> 24:47.426
Oh.

24:49.808 --> 24:50.368
Ma.

24:50.388 --> 24:50.549
Oh.

24:52.270 --> 24:52.670
Sorry.

24:53.451 --> 24:54.592
That's OK.

24:54.612 --> 24:55.673
I'm just curious.

24:59.837 --> 25:00.017
Speak up.

25:00.037 --> 25:00.097
No.

25:00.117 --> 25:03.640
The Frederick Madden illustration collection.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.502
That's from the Liz, yeah.

25:05.522 --> 25:06.422
From the Frederick.

25:06.442 --> 25:07.043
By FC Madden.

25:07.063 --> 25:08.104
By FC Madden.

25:08.124 --> 25:10.566
There you go.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.346
Beautiful.

25:19.168 --> 25:20.089
It's 52 years old.

25:22.434 --> 25:24.237
See, they really worked on these, didn't they?

25:24.317 --> 25:26.100
And then, of course, they make lithographs from these.

25:26.141 --> 25:30.829
And movie posters are a really hot, collectible item right now.

25:32.873 --> 25:34.015
Tell you about it.

25:34.035 --> 25:36.199
Is that right?

25:36.219 --> 25:38.764
Tell me about it, he said.

25:42.338 --> 25:44.200
I think that's about it.

25:44.220 --> 25:46.282
This must be like a little playland for you.

25:48.004 --> 25:48.865
Toys, have they?

25:49.306 --> 25:52.910
Look at this wonderful old photograph here.

25:54.191 --> 25:55.373
Young Miss Shirley Temple.

25:55.893 --> 26:04.683
So these are, let's see, Bigamist Spouse, Part 1, Bigamist Spouse, Part 2, Betrayed Bride, Part 1.

26:06.626 --> 26:10.590
So these are the films of the Perry Mason television series.

26:10.942 --> 26:12.404
And that's probably the whole run.

26:13.105 --> 26:13.986
That's probably all of them.

26:14.086 --> 26:15.167
And look, there are hundreds of them.

26:15.668 --> 26:18.472
And we have the strips out in the hall.

26:18.492 --> 26:18.952
They do.

26:18.972 --> 26:21.255
So it's one, two, three, four, five.

26:22.056 --> 26:25.601
So I see 20 shelves, 20 racks of film.

26:25.621 --> 26:28.124
Yeah, that's quite a few.

26:28.264 --> 26:31.208
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

26:31.228 --> 26:35.834
There must be at least 20 for a row.

26:37.977 --> 26:40.240
And that's Valgetti's drawing table.

26:44.084 --> 26:50.374
Let's say at some point it might work its way into a permanent exhibit or even a... Yes.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.498
A lot of great things were done on this.

26:53.899 --> 26:58.666
Yeah.

26:58.686 --> 27:00.269
The Scarlet O'Hara designs?

27:00.569 --> 27:03.494
Yes, they commanded.

27:03.514 --> 27:07.981
They went for, I don't know how much, but it was over $7,000.

27:08.221 --> 27:09.283
Oh, yeah.

27:09.383 --> 27:12.067
Even the unsigned ones.

27:12.087 --> 27:12.167
Hmm.

27:13.902 --> 27:19.988
And you have some of the designs here?

27:20.008 --> 27:20.549
Not though.

27:20.569 --> 27:23.712
That's how I know they went to more than $7,000.

27:23.732 --> 27:25.394
Did Texas bid for them, do you know?

27:28.837 --> 27:30.079
And Texas didn't win.

27:31.280 --> 27:36.926
That doesn't happen very often.

27:36.986 --> 27:39.408
That's the oldest English playbill.

27:39.428 --> 27:41.250
Is that what it is?

27:41.270 --> 27:42.171
What is it?

27:44.193 --> 27:48.058
I am afraid that this might be.

27:48.078 --> 27:56.028
Theater Royal and Drury Lane.

27:56.048 --> 27:56.609
David Garrick.

27:56.969 --> 27:57.690
Is this by Garrick?

28:01.314 --> 28:02.956
No.

28:03.737 --> 28:05.820
Garrick's right there.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.601
Leasy.

28:06.621 --> 28:07.202
Leasy, yeah.

28:07.262 --> 28:09.164
Well, that's pretty nice.

28:09.184 --> 28:12.208
What are these things with all the canvas?

28:12.560 --> 28:20.909
The folio-sized packages, several hundred of them I would estimate numbered.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.813
It's a big letter over there.

28:23.833 --> 28:32.302
They're actually letters to the alphabet.

28:33.724 --> 28:35.626
Simmons kept scrap books.

28:35.646 --> 28:36.086
Simmons?

28:36.247 --> 28:37.268
Who was Simmons?

28:37.468 --> 28:38.829
Oh, the costume house.

28:38.850 --> 28:39.310
I see.

28:39.914 --> 28:50.023
They kept scrapbooks on shows that had been by other, that had been costumed by other companies, just to see, sort of compare.

28:51.084 --> 28:57.030
These, what you just pulled that out of was the, these are collections of playbills from the United Kingdom.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.894
I see United Kingdom, Coburn Garden, a lot of Coburn Garden.

29:00.914 --> 29:04.297
Look at, we actually start in the eight, look at these from 1795, Connie.

29:04.357 --> 29:08.841
These are playbills that are almost 200 years old.

29:09.327 --> 29:14.072
Our oldest American playbill was 1773.

29:14.192 --> 29:14.853
Which is what?

29:18.176 --> 29:19.117
I think it was.

29:19.177 --> 29:24.022
They were doing the West End here.

29:24.042 --> 29:24.323
Uh-huh.

29:24.423 --> 29:28.367
So this is a very exceptional collection, then, I would say.

29:29.728 --> 29:33.032
Would you say this is a preeminent collection of what we're looking at right here?

29:34.033 --> 29:36.595
I don't know if I'd go that far.

29:36.615 --> 29:39.098
There must be something similar in England, right?

29:40.276 --> 29:44.402
Okay.

29:44.422 --> 29:49.730
Manuscript material had to be given export license.

29:50.351 --> 29:50.711
I'm sorry.

29:50.731 --> 29:52.093
I think I only got a little bit of that.

29:52.134 --> 29:56.861
You said you think that this library prompted the British to pass that law?

29:57.421 --> 29:57.782
Yes.

29:58.162 --> 30:03.170
Requiring export licenses for manuscript material.

30:03.831 --> 30:06.655
Oh, manuscript material under 75 years old.

30:06.972 --> 30:11.284
I think some people wanted to make it 35 years later.

30:11.966 --> 30:14.352
Great.

30:14.372 --> 30:15.515
Dr. Hill, thank you enough.

30:15.977 --> 30:16.598
Appreciate it.

30:16.979 --> 30:17.822
My pleasure.

30:18.042 --> 30:19.566
Thank you, sir.

30:19.586 --> 30:20.188
It was a pleasure to meet you.

30:25.484 --> 30:26.646
Okay, we're on.

30:26.666 --> 30:35.119
We were talking to Ray Dogner, and he was telling us a little bit about his connection with Gloria Swanson, and I guess you were working at the UN?

30:35.440 --> 30:35.700
Yes.

30:36.481 --> 30:48.019
I had a wonderful ten years there as a producer of television and film, and we had scripts that needed introductions.

30:48.280 --> 30:52.386
We could call them theater people, notable celebrities.

30:52.552 --> 31:18.340
to appear for two minutes and introduce a film like Adlai Stevenson would introduce a documentary, or Swanson would do something on children's fun. Or Helen Hayes would come in and do something on the arts or whatever. So we have this marvelous roster of people to call and their agents said wonderful and they would come in and everything was done because they were they were doing it for the United Nations. Well I met Gloria that way and we became instant friends

31:18.320 --> 31:22.947
And our friendship went on for 25 years because I met her in 57 when I arrived in New York.

31:23.748 --> 31:27.052
So over the years we became such good pals.

31:27.233 --> 31:33.822
So when I was working at Columbia, I was teaching part-time up there a video workshop.

31:34.323 --> 31:40.952
And she said, I've done my book and Random House has made a mess of my archives.

31:41.253 --> 31:48.363
She said, they have trampled, they have gone through my archives and, you know, unmercifully.

31:48.944 --> 31:50.727
Would you come and straighten them out?

31:51.187 --> 31:55.033
Because I want to prepare them for their home, wherever that is.

31:55.333 --> 31:56.575
And I said, where do you want them to go?

31:57.096 --> 32:01.442
She said, really, in New York, at Astoria Studio.

32:01.863 --> 32:02.503
Just as she wanted it.

32:02.523 --> 32:02.784
Yes.

32:03.265 --> 32:08.492
But you see, the mayor and that whole conglomerate down there in Astoria could never get their act together.

32:08.692 --> 32:13.217
to get the money together and to build

32:13.568 --> 32:17.812
the kind of housing that she wanted for her collection.

32:17.832 --> 32:21.274
She wanted a library reproduced.

32:21.475 --> 32:23.496
Her library, which is beautiful, her library.

32:23.516 --> 32:27.380
That's a major thing that Texas does offer its people, by the way.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.881
We'll just throw in.

32:28.901 --> 32:30.722
That is an inducement that brings people here.

32:30.883 --> 32:37.548
I know, but I don't think they want to talk about it anymore because we're so desperate for space.

32:37.568 --> 32:41.872
And the rooms we have there, we need that space desperately.

32:41.992 --> 32:43.373
But Dr. Gloria was

32:43.353 --> 33:11.217
quite interested in. She wanted her library reproduced, like so many others. Well uh I said she said I don't want the academy to have it and she said Astoria. We met with them. The mayor and everybody she was kind of miffed because she didn't get an Oscar. She should have had that Oscar those years and they made that Titanic film. My god Elicentia Boulevard was brilliant and she was passed over well

33:11.602 --> 33:13.325
So I said, let's go to the Smithsonian.

33:13.525 --> 33:14.667
She loved that idea.

33:15.027 --> 33:23.921
So I talked to the Smithsonian in New York, the branch of the Smithsonian at Cooper Union, and they said, does she need money?

33:23.941 --> 33:27.447
And I said, yes, she'd like to be paid for this collection.

33:27.507 --> 33:30.511
They said, Texas.

33:30.531 --> 33:32.935
And they said, go to Texas.

33:33.337 --> 33:57.032
They have the finest conservation besides us in the country. They'll take care of her things. They wanted to go on forever. When I told her that she said go down there so I called and they sent for me and I came down here. Who did you to deal with? Decker Turner, Mr. Turner. Well it's a marvelous story. Gosh they were after Texas

33:57.012 --> 33:58.615
have to win.

33:58.655 --> 34:00.217
They will not lose.

34:00.237 --> 34:01.900
Football, you name it.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.945
Or if they're bidding against something, they've got to win.

34:05.065 --> 34:08.290
Well, they were after the Stravinsky collection.

34:08.310 --> 34:10.233
And they thought they had it.

34:10.293 --> 34:12.637
They had bid a lot of money for Igor Stravinsky.

34:12.797 --> 34:16.623
And by the way, his archives were in the Gloria Swanson's building in New York.

34:16.944 --> 34:17.364
So funny.

34:18.046 --> 34:19.187
Swanson and Stravinsky.

34:19.328 --> 34:19.628
Well,

34:20.671 --> 34:25.638
The judge decided they should, the Swarinski's should go to California.

34:25.658 --> 34:28.342
And Mr. Kraft, who was Swarinski's assistant.

34:28.362 --> 34:28.723
Oh, sorry.

34:28.783 --> 34:32.048
I just want to make sure we're working because this is so good.

34:32.168 --> 34:32.729
All right.

34:32.869 --> 34:33.069
It is.

34:33.089 --> 34:37.135
He wanted to go to California because they'd offered him a professorship in music there.

34:37.916 --> 34:39.959
So he pushed for California.

34:39.980 --> 34:46.569
And the judge decided against Texas, which, as he felt, would be more accessible in California.

34:46.589 --> 34:47.491
Well, it did.

34:47.611 --> 34:50.475
It was told, they were told it would go to Texas.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.450
to California.

34:53.472 --> 34:58.178
Turner came to contest it, went to court, and he lost it.

34:58.458 --> 35:03.264
Well, he told me, he said, I hate going back without it.

35:03.284 --> 35:08.691
And he said, and when he came to see me, he said, I'll take Swanson.

35:08.711 --> 35:12.075
If I can't take Stravinsky back, I'll take Swanson.

35:12.095 --> 35:15.620
And I said, yes, there's another rest.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.042
Selznick?

35:17.062 --> 35:17.222
Swanson?

35:17.759 --> 35:43.007
and it was so funny. So he I uh he wasn't wild about theater. It was not, although he we've got it we've got to give him credit. He did he did buy the salesman for us. So wasn't he when the boys. Oh yes oh very very. That's the parole story that the chalmers will tell you yeah anyway

35:43.207 --> 35:44.836
So we're back to Gloria.

35:45.218 --> 35:49.420
So when I went to Smithsonian, they said,

35:50.277 --> 35:51.519
Finest conservation.

35:51.599 --> 35:55.403
So when Turner said, come down and look us over and tell Ms.

35:55.423 --> 36:00.730
Swanson that if you like us, we'll offer you some money.

36:00.750 --> 36:01.191
And they did.

36:02.172 --> 36:08.940
And so she said, well, I think we should go there because I want to come down there and lecture to the kids.

36:09.561 --> 36:12.325
She said, I want to talk to them about what they put in their stomachs.

36:12.345 --> 36:13.867
It was all health and nutrition.

36:14.267 --> 36:18.192
She was gaga, and rightly so.

36:18.745 --> 36:20.748
No.

36:20.768 --> 36:26.716
Howard seems to think that he got it.

36:27.137 --> 36:31.623
No, I know that little story, because Howard dealt with me.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.167
She saw Howard for 20 minutes.

36:34.467 --> 36:39.334
And then she said, he said he ate macrobiotic food for a whole lot of disease.

36:39.354 --> 36:39.835
We should turn that off.

36:39.855 --> 36:41.797
That was, I'll tell you, my friend, that was an absolute fabrication.

36:41.818 --> 36:42.519
He saw her 20 minutes.

36:42.679 --> 36:44.441
And he was only there that day.

36:45.122 --> 36:48.567
And I showed him what we had.

36:48.547 --> 36:52.012
And he was very interested.

36:52.032 --> 37:01.745
And he sent her, oh, I mean, this man, Idar, the Great Panache, he sent her, I think, three or four dozen roses or carnations.

37:01.765 --> 37:06.351
It's just the room was, you know, it was like a real Hollywood.

37:06.371 --> 37:06.892
Oh, he worked.

37:06.912 --> 37:08.814
And he wrote a lovely letter.

37:08.834 --> 37:10.497
He likes great letters.

37:10.837 --> 37:11.438
Beautiful.

37:11.458 --> 37:12.259
And she said,

37:12.239 --> 37:20.032
Well, I think Texas has the upper hand here, because she said, conservation, they're going to keep my thing forever.

37:20.252 --> 37:22.115
And I told her, I loved it here.

37:22.295 --> 37:25.520
And I wanted to get out of New York.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.665
Was this part of the thing that you'd come with the collection?

37:28.806 --> 37:29.347
Not really.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.530
So I hit it off with Turner.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.334
We got on very well.

37:33.354 --> 37:39.308
And he said, well, if she decides not to, he said, will you consider coming and being my assistant curator of theater arts?

37:39.428 --> 37:41.012
I said, you betcha.

37:41.112 --> 37:42.776
Because my background was film.

37:42.796 --> 37:44.039
He needed a film person here.

37:44.139 --> 37:46.003
Dr. Crane was theater.

37:46.024 --> 37:47.106
So I said, yes.

37:47.491 --> 37:52.259
So I told Gloria, I've been offered the job, she said, well, I'm going to accept their offer.

37:52.339 --> 37:55.163
And she said, and I want you to take my collection down there.

37:55.183 --> 37:56.886
So it's a lovely story.

37:56.906 --> 37:59.029
It's a very, well, it's great.

37:59.049 --> 38:01.814
And then we were getting... What year was this, by the way?

38:01.854 --> 38:08.605
Well, she, I came, she died April of 83, and I arrived in January of 83.

38:08.625 --> 38:14.494
I was preparing her exhibition for her to come down to present it to the campus.

38:14.761 --> 38:16.322
And she died.

38:16.342 --> 38:17.523
Now, how is this?

38:17.543 --> 38:19.225
Does he pay a million dollars for it?

38:19.445 --> 38:20.386
No, I can't.

38:20.466 --> 38:20.706
No.

38:21.427 --> 38:21.607
No.

38:21.767 --> 38:22.328
You see?

38:22.668 --> 38:23.689
Bless his heart.

38:23.729 --> 38:25.550
He's right out of 20th Century Fox.

38:26.111 --> 38:26.231
Yeah.

38:26.771 --> 38:27.892
He really is.

38:27.912 --> 38:29.213
And look what he's got.

38:29.233 --> 38:31.335
He's got Roddy McDowell working for him.

38:31.455 --> 38:32.596
He's got Joan Fontaine.

38:32.777 --> 38:33.657
He's got everybody.

38:33.677 --> 38:34.558
Betty Davis.

38:34.678 --> 38:36.540
And he's got James Mason.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.541
Those collections.

38:38.602 --> 38:38.942
Oh, my.

38:39.002 --> 38:42.805
When I interviewed James Mason, I said, where is your collection going?

38:42.825 --> 38:43.806
He said, we're to Boston.

38:44.444 --> 39:00.394
i mean you've got to handle tomorrow because he got at people he does it without money by the way he does

39:00.374 --> 39:04.958
He's a very gracious man.

39:05.218 --> 39:05.919
Yes, he is.

39:05.979 --> 39:09.682
He has nothing but wonderful things to say about it.

39:09.702 --> 39:11.924
I will show this on the record.

39:11.944 --> 39:13.806
He has nothing but wonderful.

39:13.886 --> 39:16.068
I called him the day before he's coming down.

39:16.088 --> 39:17.449
I said, Howard, what can you tell me?

39:17.469 --> 39:18.450
What should I be looking for?

39:18.510 --> 39:20.352
He said, that place is going to blow your eyes out.

39:20.372 --> 39:21.893
He said, it's spectacular.

39:21.913 --> 39:22.454
I took my back to that.

39:22.474 --> 39:23.195
Well, that's very generous.

39:23.215 --> 39:26.538
But I got such a kickoff because a million dollars, I mean, he's really a bundle.

39:26.558 --> 39:29.140
You said there was money, so there wasn't some money.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.381
There was, but it certainly wasn't a million dollars.

39:30.361 --> 39:35.734
Did it come out of appropriated funds?

39:35.774 --> 39:43.372
At that time, I'm sure Dr. Staley told him, Mr. Turner was getting $2 million a year.

39:44.535 --> 39:46.159
He was having $2 million to do.

39:46.375 --> 39:55.556
At that time, when I arrived, I was told by the business office, they said, well, our allotment is $2 million a year.

39:55.676 --> 39:56.999
Oh, of course it is.

39:57.119 --> 39:58.422
That's just from the state.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.587
That's account that you're getting from benefactors.

40:00.989 --> 40:09.409
But you see, Ransom instilled this in this crowd, and you'll get that from Griffin, I'm sure, because he charmed everybody.

40:09.509 --> 40:17.007
And I'll tell you, someone else who loves these stories about Dr. Ransom is the lady you're going to meet next, is Kathleen Gee, who's here.

40:16.987 --> 40:20.112
who worked under Radsen and knew him very well.

40:20.132 --> 40:23.197
She, Kathleen Gee, is a curator of the art collection.

40:23.277 --> 40:30.028
And this is another exciting, you see Carlton Lakes materials there, the captoes and all those great, great art.

40:30.048 --> 40:31.931
But, well, how are we doing?

40:31.991 --> 40:34.776
Should we be on our way?

40:35.853 --> 40:41.019
She never got the chance to come down and talk to students.

40:41.059 --> 40:44.703
The first thing I'll ask them, she said, what's in your stomach today?

40:44.783 --> 40:46.024
What do you eat?

40:46.405 --> 40:49.768
Then she said, I'll get around to those other things, my career.

40:49.788 --> 40:50.830
That's later.

40:51.350 --> 40:56.576
But she was, you know, her health and nutrition files here are fantastic.

40:56.596 --> 40:58.418
She began with Rachel Carson.

40:58.398 --> 41:00.421
Worrying about the environment.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.003
Worrying about all of this.

41:02.143 --> 41:02.964
Early on.

41:03.865 --> 41:04.586
Very much.

41:04.606 --> 41:07.210
And I've got files.

41:07.230 --> 41:08.572
So many feet.

41:08.672 --> 41:10.755
Of her files of health and nutrition.

41:10.775 --> 41:13.739
Cancer.

41:13.859 --> 41:14.920
Everything we're worried about.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.223
The letters she wrote all over Europe.

41:17.804 --> 41:18.705
Everywhere in Europe.

41:18.745 --> 41:21.149
She corresponded to all the great doctors.

41:21.329 --> 41:25.154
That's right.

41:25.294 --> 41:25.635
No.

41:27.497 --> 41:28.118
He's happy.

41:28.925 --> 41:46.229
All right, Ransom got the permission from the Board of Regents in 1957 to the ordinary HRC, what other place is called Special Collections, and he named it the Humanities Research Center, very cleverly knowing that after this day, there was a college.

41:48.872 --> 41:57.244
Harry Ransom Center, butâ€” Are you speculating on this, or do you think thatâ€” I'm speculating, because I got to know him not

41:57.899 --> 42:08.251
that well, but for six years, and finally to the point where he'd call and say, well, what do you think?

42:08.271 --> 42:17.082
Actually, he called me just a couple weeks before he died and said, I have this wonderful collection of 1,500 paintings in New York.

42:17.362 --> 42:19.405
Where can you put them?

42:19.425 --> 42:21.708
I said, don't worry, I'll put them in the blank.

42:21.928 --> 42:24.311
Can you just call it like that?

42:24.331 --> 42:24.531
Yes, yes.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.463
things that he just purchased, that he was about to purchase.

42:27.483 --> 42:28.725
See, I don't know whether it was a gift.

42:28.825 --> 42:29.906
It was probably a gift.

42:30.988 --> 42:34.812
If there was anything people liked to do, it would give him things.

42:34.832 --> 42:46.707
The great famous story about Ransom, I'll show you his portrait down here, was he was so, he had such a presence that he didn't have to say very much.

42:46.727 --> 42:53.775
And the great story is this man came out of his office and somebody had been waiting outside and said, what did he say?

42:54.059 --> 42:57.264
He said, I don't know, but I gave him $20,000.

42:57.924 --> 43:01.289
Is that an apocryphal story?

43:01.329 --> 43:02.671
No, it's a true story.

43:02.691 --> 43:06.897
It's because the man told me what he's been doing.

43:06.937 --> 43:12.685
Could you tell me, just before we, how long you've been here and what you've got?

43:12.906 --> 43:14.067
I've been here 20 years.

43:14.949 --> 43:16.331
All right, let's go back to 57.

43:16.471 --> 43:19.275
He got the board written permission.

43:19.395 --> 43:23.020
In 61, he appointed a director.

43:23.422 --> 43:31.131
Dr. Warren Roberts, and he had a bookkeeper, and that was all he had.

43:31.151 --> 43:40.221
That was his stack in 61, and there was no space on campus for the marvelous collection, except the tower.

43:41.182 --> 43:47.269
Well, the tower was designed to be stacked, so that when you get off the elevator, you go down this

43:47.873 --> 43:52.659
which goes all the way around the tower, and there's very tiny offices.

43:53.721 --> 43:55.263
And this was the arrangement.

43:56.645 --> 44:01.732
As the boxes began to appear in the early 60s, they were just stuffed into the tower.

44:02.913 --> 44:16.952
And I remember when I came in 1970, going to see his assistant he brought from the history department, where he was teaching, with Mrs. Francis Hudson.

44:16.972 --> 44:17.593
He did everything.

44:18.687 --> 44:20.610
She arranged all her parties.

44:20.630 --> 44:21.972
She talked to the janitor.

44:21.992 --> 44:26.038
She negotiated with the captain's representatives and the governor's office.

44:26.058 --> 44:27.440
She was just it.

44:28.221 --> 44:37.214
And I got up the elevator, walked down the hall to her office, which was stacked to the ceiling with cardboard boxes so that you had to walk like this.

44:37.895 --> 44:41.961
And there was a Tiffany lamp sitting right in the corner.

44:42.762 --> 44:46.467
And she rounded the corner and leaned left.

44:47.088 --> 44:50.793
I mean, it was coming so fast.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.879
Did anyone have a sense of what was coming in?

44:55.380 --> 45:00.027
Or was he really seizing the moment to get stuff that was available?

45:00.047 --> 45:00.147
Both.

45:00.207 --> 45:01.048
But he knew.

45:01.068 --> 45:03.091
He knew what was good and what was good.

45:03.352 --> 45:04.754
All you had to do was tell him.

45:04.874 --> 45:08.920
He was so well-read and so cautious.

45:08.940 --> 45:13.626
And he was going back to 1900, first man.

45:14.107 --> 45:16.791
This university opened in 1983.

45:17.530 --> 45:21.616
There was a man named Dr. Battle, who became a legend in the history.

45:22.858 --> 45:31.571
And it was his dream in the early 1900s to make this the cultural center of the Southwest, because there isn't anything else.

45:32.533 --> 45:33.935
It certainly wasn't since.

45:35.517 --> 45:37.200
And he began collecting.

45:37.220 --> 45:40.625
He bought what is now known as the Battle Cast.

45:41.547 --> 45:42.508
That is, they were

45:42.910 --> 45:48.818
Italian copies of all of the Vatican, the fine works in the Vatican collections.

45:48.838 --> 45:54.947
And they're now in the second photo there.

45:54.967 --> 46:01.536
And then the crown of culture sort of passed on to a dean called Dr. Griffith.

46:01.556 --> 46:03.780
And his interest was purely personal.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.123
He was a teacher in the English department.

46:06.143 --> 46:07.325
He had no money to spend.

46:08.066 --> 46:12.512
But he tried to, interested in giving to the university.

46:13.167 --> 46:22.315
And so Ransom sort of picked up the spark, Griffin was one of his features, and carried it on.

46:22.355 --> 46:24.397
This is where it began, in other words.

46:24.477 --> 46:24.878
Well, yes.

46:25.078 --> 46:30.263
What I've heard the phrase, I've heard often over and over, is the vision, the vision, the man had a vision.

46:30.283 --> 46:30.563
The vision.

46:31.204 --> 46:41.453
Well, he had the vision probably without these other men, but at least they gave him a precedent, and they gave him some knowledge of what we all really own.

46:41.602 --> 46:44.966
You understand, before HRC, there'd be no inventory.

46:46.027 --> 46:48.890
The Wren collection goes back quite a bit.

46:48.910 --> 46:49.110
All right.

46:49.270 --> 46:56.658
In the tower, there was this exquisite three, four rooms there, wood panel, two stories.

46:57.218 --> 47:01.443
At the top was Buss and Homer and people.

47:01.483 --> 47:03.084
That was the Stark Library.

47:03.785 --> 47:05.567
And this was the rare books library.

47:05.800 --> 47:11.051
It was beautiful wood paneled and decorated with the furniture of the family.

47:11.553 --> 47:16.644
And a wonderful lady named Fanny Ratchford used to serve two there at his work line.

47:17.045 --> 47:23.218
They were one of the brightest students who was invited to there.

47:24.194 --> 47:28.539
But that was the only repository of the University of Australia.

47:28.559 --> 47:32.824
There's this beautiful section of the ivory tower and the tower.

47:32.844 --> 47:34.666
Was that the purpose of the tower, by the way?

47:34.706 --> 47:37.730
Was it intended to be a repository for books?

47:37.750 --> 47:37.930
Library.

47:38.130 --> 47:40.473
Yeah, the library was back.

47:40.493 --> 47:41.934
Two elevators that went up in there.

47:41.954 --> 47:44.537
But that's why the tower was built to be a library?

47:44.557 --> 47:45.538
Is that it?

47:45.639 --> 47:47.160
Yes, primarily.

47:47.280 --> 47:50.404
But those rooms at that time had

47:51.211 --> 47:52.813
were mostly offices.

47:53.473 --> 47:55.095
Space has always been a problem.

47:55.335 --> 48:06.427
And so, when I came in, the paintings, they had built rough stacks for the paintings.

48:06.747 --> 48:17.058
Then Dr. Renson, in 1965, began to build, I forget when he became chancellor, he was chancellor for nine years, so he became chancellor about 62.

48:17.459 --> 48:18.720
In other words, he got

48:19.088 --> 48:19.769
H.R.C.

48:19.849 --> 48:23.374
going, Vendikin, the Chancellor, and the Board of Regents of Dorothy.

48:23.975 --> 48:32.166
And all he had to do was go down and stand before them once a year and say, I want $2 million.

48:32.186 --> 48:35.330
They didn't even ask him what for.

48:36.211 --> 48:38.274
They absolutely trusted him.

48:39.155 --> 48:39.716
Totally.

48:39.736 --> 48:40.777
And that was just the beginning.

48:40.837 --> 48:42.680
I mean, that was $2 million from the state.

48:42.700 --> 48:47.226
He managed to get additional millions from private benefactors.

48:47.486 --> 48:48.167
Individuals.

48:48.923 --> 48:52.328
All right, I'll show you the collections on this floor.

48:53.129 --> 49:04.565
Each firstâ€”every time I show the Knopf Room, the Tinker Room, the Dolby Room, the Hobbit's Bell, and the Gardener, people say, why did theyâ€”this is such a strange place.

49:04.585 --> 49:05.907
For Knopf, particularly.

49:06.028 --> 49:06.769
Oh, probably.

49:06.789 --> 49:08.050
It was a quintessential New York publisher.

49:08.271 --> 49:09.472
There's only one answer.

49:09.493 --> 49:12.998
They like Dr. Wink, that it did.

49:13.018 --> 49:18.205
Actually, well, there's an addendum to that, and that in 60 stores,

49:18.877 --> 49:24.347
Ransom started building this building as an interim building.

49:24.368 --> 49:30.279
See, really the chancellor required a great deal of entertainment.

49:30.399 --> 49:35.950
We had one president who was fired because he forgot to include the right people in his free football game.

49:37.152 --> 49:39.076
Who is that?

49:39.316 --> 49:39.557
Spurs.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.340
He got fired?

49:41.827 --> 49:45.734
The other thing he didn't do was find H.R.

49:45.834 --> 49:46.415
Philly.

49:46.576 --> 49:49.180
I thought that was more important than the football.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.829
He got a letter shot down to the door the next morning for the job.

49:53.849 --> 49:56.954
But anyway, nice man.

49:58.256 --> 50:04.307
Just came from Michigan, didn't know a thing about Texas.

50:04.888 --> 50:05.269
Anyway.

50:05.671 --> 50:09.256
So, if you'll notice, this beautiful floor used to have an outer court.

50:09.356 --> 50:14.663
That was a courtyard in the center with glass on and satuary, and it was very elegant.

50:14.683 --> 50:24.095
And this floor was designed for one special collection room, because at that time he would accept the material from people.

50:24.215 --> 50:29.502
They always say, I'll give you my material if you give me the room.

50:29.650 --> 50:41.347
There was a lot to do with having this huge, enormous reading here, almost read it for years, when you cannot decide if you might consider doing the works.

50:42.669 --> 50:47.776
If you had space available for people, it jumps the chance, as did Mishnah.

50:48.638 --> 50:54.967
It was between UCLA and UC, and I'm getting ahead of myself.

50:55.207 --> 50:59.353
All right, so this floor was just a marvelous moonlight candlelight.

50:59.975 --> 51:11.010
at which he would have at least 200 people per capita, I would say, that each one probably wound up giving him as much as $100.

51:11.050 --> 51:14.394
He doesn't appear anything.

51:14.555 --> 51:23.246
He formed the chancellor's council, which consists of people who give $10,000 each year to the chancellor's purse.

51:23.427 --> 51:24.728
When did he do this?

51:24.808 --> 51:26.050
About when did he start this?

51:26.620 --> 51:30.345
Well, I see if he became chancellor in 62, it was 62 or three.

51:30.365 --> 51:31.667
So he did this right off the bat.

51:32.127 --> 51:35.572
This is how Earl Stanley Gardner got snatched.

51:35.932 --> 51:41.179
He was always being honored for his work in the criminal law.

51:41.300 --> 51:47.268
He got innocent people out.

51:47.548 --> 51:52.915
The Texas Bar brought him here to give him an honorary membership in the Texas Bar.

51:53.283 --> 51:58.531
He was introduced to Ransom, Ransom, Stuckman immediately on the chance of counseling.

51:58.551 --> 52:02.737
He became good friends of Dr. Mentor of the Board of Reasons.

52:02.757 --> 52:05.241
They became hunting buddies.

52:05.261 --> 52:17.159
And Dr. Mentor says they've cooked this earthen and earthen study up on hunting with them.

52:17.179 --> 52:22.547
But there was a precedent also that William Faulkner has just opened that Oxford, Mississippi

52:23.607 --> 52:49.632
but it's a very effective device isn't it though i mean to offer a person we're not just going to take your things and keep them and make them available as a scholar but we're going to

52:49.882 --> 52:56.909
We're going to recreate your personality for those people that really do it.

52:56.929 --> 53:01.234
And that is a pretty persuasive monument to offer to some of it.

53:01.254 --> 53:01.414
Right.

53:01.454 --> 53:12.505
The second question is, Earl Stanley Gardner was no author, so why he should not have a place in that literary tradition?

53:12.525 --> 53:17.290
And the answer to that is that he was certainly an influence, if nothing else.

53:17.540 --> 53:39.632
But Dr. Ransom's idea was to build the famous mystery story collection in the United States, because we have all of our becoming daughters, everything, correspondence, including 72 photographs, which he lectured.

53:39.933 --> 53:46.780
His son died in World War I, and he spent most of his life trying to contact with some of the mediums.

53:47.441 --> 53:50.104
He got interested, and he wrote a book on spiritualism.

53:50.124 --> 53:54.509
He and Joe Dini got together and tried to, he was always trying to recouple.

53:55.069 --> 53:57.392
His mother, wasn't it?

53:57.412 --> 53:57.832
Yes.

53:57.852 --> 54:07.583
And they did a long series of things together, and both came to the conclusion that most mediums did all of that.

54:07.783 --> 54:08.944
But anyway, we had this marvelous

54:09.430 --> 54:16.361
pictures of ghosts, little forms hovering over, ladies sitting on gardens, you see.

54:17.043 --> 54:20.528
But, well, the material here is so incredible.

54:20.548 --> 54:21.550
What is the name of this building?

54:21.570 --> 54:25.356
Is this built as an annex to the HIC, or what do I call this?

54:25.376 --> 54:25.957
This was before.

54:25.977 --> 54:27.079
This is 64.

54:27.099 --> 54:28.061
This building.

54:28.081 --> 54:33.750
And, uh, this, only the fourth floor is what we call the academic center.

54:34.186 --> 54:42.796
The Jack Josie's, that's all I'm going to use to engage this room down here, called the Jack Josie Honors Room, which is to be used just for honor students.

54:42.816 --> 54:44.958
Well, that didn't work out at all.

54:44.978 --> 54:48.002
But this whole floor was open for students all day long.

54:48.162 --> 54:51.165
Anybody could come up and sit down and soak up the culture.

54:51.926 --> 55:00.475
And I'll show you each individual room had the library and the donors in it, and the artifacts.

55:00.496 --> 55:03.619
And the manuscripts collection was here.

55:04.055 --> 55:14.746
Because they were the most precious.

55:17.389 --> 55:27.299
And the vault, where my paintings are now, I'll show you, was building a book set for the manuscripts at that time.

55:27.319 --> 55:31.463
Then he started building his dream house, which is the Harry Ransom thing.

55:32.759 --> 55:34.721
And we were all still in the tower.

55:35.562 --> 55:47.337
Six months before the building opened, James Mishner came and said, I can't make up my mind between UCLA and Texas.

55:48.658 --> 55:53.504
And so Ransom invited me.

55:54.145 --> 55:59.391
He called the chairman of the architecture department, Taniguchi.

56:00.502 --> 56:05.687
and the Tonakuchi's gave a dinner party for James Michonne.

56:05.707 --> 56:17.579
It was, Mrs. Tonakuchi was Japanese, and he gave a speech on the floor, a Japanese dinner party for James Michonne, whose wife is Japanese.

56:17.599 --> 56:18.200
Pretty, pretty.

56:18.220 --> 56:19.961
I understand Mr. Lansom now.

56:19.981 --> 56:23.365
I mean, he didn't miss, he didn't miss anything.

56:23.525 --> 56:25.807
There wasn't anything he didn't know.

56:25.967 --> 56:27.549
Public relations, public affairs.

56:27.649 --> 56:30.492
Anything had to do that turned out the two women as being

56:30.944 --> 56:38.295
interned in the same camp in Nevada during World War II.

56:38.315 --> 56:41.860
So I'm sure that it was announced within the week that the collection was coming here.

56:42.301 --> 56:45.245
Oh, before the next day was.

56:45.706 --> 56:52.196
Anyway, so I'll explain to you now why I didn't get it.

56:52.216 --> 56:53.237
That was my space.

56:53.357 --> 56:55.821
It was one of the first years ago.

56:56.324 --> 57:01.391
that the art collection came here when the manuscript moved into the new building.

57:01.411 --> 57:14.430
And Michener Collection moved into the first three floors of that building instead of acres and materials, which has turned out to be a catastrophic mistake, because if you walk into that building, you don't see HRC.

57:14.530 --> 57:16.093
You don't know what you're seeing.

57:17.154 --> 57:18.817
What has your title been through the years?

57:18.837 --> 57:24.525
Have you had a number of... Well, I've always been a curator of the art collection.

57:25.248 --> 57:37.999
A couple of years after I started here, I got, there was a full-time person running the floor, which is open for entertainers to all universities or universities, which is another full-time job.

57:38.019 --> 57:48.768
So I did that until just last year, because I've never been able to spend enough time in the art collection because of that particular job.

57:48.868 --> 57:51.550
I'm hoping they're going to hire somebody else now.

57:51.570 --> 57:53.032
I'm not supposed to be in charge of that thing.

57:54.133 --> 57:54.613
I'm hiring one.

57:54.998 --> 58:00.265
So I'm the curator of the editor of the art book.

58:00.285 --> 58:02.569
And you've written a few wonderful books.

58:03.089 --> 58:06.975
Two excellent books on that.

58:06.995 --> 58:10.540
Well, one of the interesting things is the artwork about.

58:11.962 --> 58:12.703
I read about them.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.686
There's something like 80,000?

58:15.086 --> 58:15.747
Is that right?

58:16.128 --> 58:19.352
No, there are 100,000 pieces in the collection.

58:19.771 --> 58:30.683
But this is not the, you know, seven million manuscripts, two and a half million, uh, two and a half million photographs, and figure out just a couple hundred things.

58:30.723 --> 58:35.168
But I mean, a hundred thousand artworks by, by, with literary connections?

58:35.188 --> 58:41.575
Well, you have to, you have to include anything from the writing.

58:41.715 --> 58:48.563
Well, I understand that, but I mean, it's, but they all have a literary connection with it.

58:49.268 --> 58:52.834
Well, not all of them.

58:52.854 --> 58:59.124
See, this collection includes everything that's given to the university since 1913.

58:59.144 --> 59:03.051
It's not just Fort Ramsey collected.

59:03.071 --> 59:05.515
Well, so he added, you know, he built on that.

59:05.535 --> 59:07.618
He built on that, in other words.

59:08.119 --> 59:08.239
Right.

59:09.518 --> 59:19.571
The first gift I was given to this university in 1883 was done by Elizabeth Nade, who was a German sculptor who was famous in Europe at 21.

59:19.671 --> 59:23.435
She did King Elizabeth's portrait in his palace.

59:25.298 --> 59:27.961
She did King George of Hanover.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.044
She did David Grimm.

59:30.064 --> 59:31.626
She did Calderon Bonfiro.

59:32.186 --> 59:37.433
She did all... She's supposed to have done Queen Victoria and the Pope.

59:38.780 --> 59:55.105
She came here in 71, and her CEO is now a museum here, but she gave to the university her butt of Governor Ora Roberts, who was the man who pushed the bill through the legislature to get the university created.

59:56.246 --> 01:00:01.214
And this little house over here, if you have time, tell me how many of you did it.

01:00:01.414 --> 01:00:04.819
All right, this little house on the corner is called Littlefield House.

01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:06.762
Littlefield was a Civil War.

01:00:06.843 --> 01:00:10.287
He made his money after the war and cattle died.

01:00:11.729 --> 01:00:14.552
And he gave, the university had no money.

01:00:16.074 --> 01:00:22.822
So he gave them $100,000 to build one building, and that was the University of Texas in 1883.

01:00:22.862 --> 01:00:24.084
That's a lot of money.

01:00:24.104 --> 01:00:24.384
It was.

01:00:24.404 --> 01:00:24.805
It was.

01:00:24.845 --> 01:00:25.966
It's called the main building.

01:00:26.046 --> 01:00:27.448
And then he built that house.

01:00:27.468 --> 01:00:29.831
It's a little room on it with shutter doors that open.

01:00:29.971 --> 01:00:33.475
So he could sit there in the evening and watch his students walk their building.

01:00:33.623 --> 01:00:38.889
He also commissioned a portrait of Robert E. Livingston.

01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:44.915
His wife went crazy and went to the bell tower.

01:00:44.935 --> 01:00:48.399
There's a painting she did in the downstairs parlors when you go in.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.841
It's Venetian.

01:00:49.861 --> 01:00:51.963
Yeah, very murky, dark, dark, dark.

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:56.608
How well did you get to know Dr. Ashton?

01:00:56.628 --> 01:00:57.869
Did you work closely with him?

01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:01.393
Sort of, yes, after we got started.

01:01:01.413 --> 01:01:03.175
As I say, he called me up.

01:01:04.353 --> 01:01:06.027
Here's our two.
