00:02.258 --> 00:04.420
We're talking to Linda.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.582
Congratulations on your book.

00:07.423 --> 00:17.292
So tell me about, I read, I guess, on the Random House, in-house thing that you actually said that you pay for stories, you pay for ideas.

00:18.033 --> 00:18.293
Yeah.

00:18.313 --> 00:19.614
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:19.634 --> 00:20.495
It's not a whole, really.

00:20.775 --> 00:25.159
I think it started with the payment thing.

00:25.260 --> 00:28.983
It started because I do so much work with criminals.

00:29.003 --> 00:30.004
And...

00:30.743 --> 00:36.692
It just kind of is a... I don't go away owing anybody else.

00:36.712 --> 00:37.573
You don't go what, I'm sorry?

00:37.693 --> 00:39.937
Owing anybody.

00:40.017 --> 00:40.217
Okay.

00:40.317 --> 00:46.146
It also, by payment, means that you don't feel as if you're intruding.

00:46.186 --> 00:49.771
If you keep on going back and saying, listen, remember you said you went to this and this and this.

00:49.871 --> 00:50.572
Is that true?

00:50.632 --> 00:56.621
So that I can keep on going back and asking for more and more information.

00:56.641 --> 00:57.963
Because it's kind of an understanding.

00:57.983 --> 00:58.784
Because it's a deal.

00:59.165 --> 00:59.265
Yeah.

00:59.313 --> 01:06.084
Sometimes I've paid with fridges, sometimes the oven or the car, whatever the deal is.

01:07.847 --> 01:10.531
But it's legal.

01:10.551 --> 01:23.633
I know I've talked to some people like Bob Parker, who says he won't even open mail that comes to him unsolicited because he's afraid it's an idea that somebody...

01:23.933 --> 01:26.196
is going to later, you know, whack them up for money.

01:26.216 --> 01:26.837
Yeah, because it does.

01:26.857 --> 01:31.242
I mean, I have to have virtually a full-time litigation lawyer on hand.

01:31.262 --> 01:33.645
Because... So there is that problem.

01:33.665 --> 01:43.037
Yeah, it's like, recently, I've just had somebody approach to sue me.

01:44.598 --> 01:52.388
And I did a film, a TV series, six hours, on paratroopers returning into civilian life.

01:53.212 --> 01:55.174
Paratroopers from?

01:55.415 --> 01:55.895
The army.

01:56.136 --> 01:57.217
Yeah, but I mean from which war?

01:58.278 --> 02:00.541
Well, no, it was just, you know, the regiment.

02:00.581 --> 02:05.908
But they were actually paratroopers from the Falklands this long, a certain group that I concentrated.

02:05.928 --> 02:07.349
But they're probably in their 40s or something like that.

02:07.370 --> 02:08.110
Now they are.

02:09.012 --> 02:19.084
But I was just fascinated to find out that the army gave no kind of rehabilitation process to them, no

02:19.621 --> 02:21.924
preparation for being put out in the city.

02:22.305 --> 02:24.427
Plus they have these skills that... A killer.

02:24.768 --> 02:25.589
They're trained to kill.

02:25.629 --> 02:28.112
They have similar problems with the special forces here.

02:28.132 --> 02:32.718
Because the government in England don't admit there is any form of a problem at all.

02:33.319 --> 02:39.848
And another part of the problem is that the men are so proud that they won't admit that they have a problem.

02:39.868 --> 02:47.097
And I met this specific group of soldiers, all decorated for bravery.

02:47.498 --> 02:52.163
and all very skilled in specific killing skills, really.

02:53.604 --> 02:56.507
And I worked with them for a couple of weeks on this thing.

02:58.009 --> 03:02.654
And then they pulled an armed robbery.

03:03.314 --> 03:03.995
They pulled a what?

03:04.175 --> 03:04.856
Armed robbery.

03:04.896 --> 03:05.477
No kidding.

03:06.638 --> 03:07.379
And went away.

03:07.419 --> 03:09.781
They all got heavy sentences.

03:09.801 --> 03:11.663
Well, they couldn't have been that skilled, a bigger cut.

03:12.844 --> 03:16.408
Well, they only got caught because it was a tip-off.

03:17.047 --> 03:20.552
Somebody dimed them, as we say.

03:20.572 --> 03:25.999
So they left, owing me a lot of money, owing everybody they'd ever met money.

03:26.079 --> 03:28.543
So you were saying, this is the finest so-called regiment.

03:29.825 --> 03:31.427
And look at these guys, what a mess.

03:31.447 --> 03:32.568
That's a hell of a story.

03:33.550 --> 03:38.677
So I wrote this show, and I paid them.

03:40.219 --> 03:45.366
I also had to, because I'd guaranteed a business for them, I had to pay that.

03:46.375 --> 03:49.059
And I paid them all the way through.

03:50.382 --> 03:56.411
And now, eight years later, when one of them has just been released, he's suing me for more money.

03:57.814 --> 04:02.802
But not only that, what I find absolutely appalling is that he's got legal aid to do it.

04:03.843 --> 04:09.092
See, I'm a walking target, so they can come after me.

04:10.608 --> 04:16.134
Probably it was that situation with the paratroopers where I now have very tough contracts.

04:16.154 --> 04:20.879
So if somebody comes to me with a story, I say, well, this is the contract.

04:20.899 --> 04:21.860
This is how much I pay you.

04:21.880 --> 04:26.104
Well, in this particular instance, what I read, the gal had her own lawyer out in the car.

04:26.304 --> 04:27.305
In the car park.

04:27.325 --> 04:27.846
Is that right?

04:27.866 --> 04:27.946
Yes.

04:27.966 --> 04:37.236
So she, you know, ex-policewoman, I mean, she was also, you know, she was a very tough woman.

04:37.256 --> 04:39.518
I mean, she was a hard guy.

04:39.953 --> 05:09.167
unlikable wasn't it unlikable yeah and i mean to find a path that was in any way you were you could be drawn to her uh it just quite fascinated me too to attempt to do something you know why should we particularly like the person that we're reading well because it's a convention in reading we do like to have the reader does like to have some sort of empathy with the uh the character although i can think of occasions where

05:09.485 --> 05:12.968
The day of the jackal, for instance, where we hate that guy.

05:13.148 --> 05:15.010
And we all, you know, the protagonist.

05:15.030 --> 05:23.817
But if you look at the new, a lot of new movies now, you say, well, who do I want to rate in this?

05:24.578 --> 05:26.460
Who am I going for?

05:26.500 --> 05:27.521
There isn't anyone, really.

05:29.102 --> 05:38.310
I think it's a different concept that nowadays we are expected to only read something that we can associate ourselves with the heroine or heroes.

05:38.611 --> 05:43.539
We should ask your back to his rather.

05:43.639 --> 05:53.194
I'm just thinking in terms of being in the business of writing, you certainly don't want to give something to people that they aren't going to enjoy and not buy.

05:53.795 --> 05:55.157
I hate to bring up commerce.

05:55.538 --> 06:04.973
I was interviewed on the radio and they asked me to read out a description of her.

06:05.240 --> 06:12.111
It's so appalling, the description of her when she went to hospital.

06:12.812 --> 06:21.306
But it's like, we gloss over and trivialise so much.

06:22.808 --> 06:31.382
And on television we see one week somebody is an alcoholic in a soap opera, and the next week they're clean.

06:31.784 --> 06:34.228
Somebody is a drug addict, and the next week they're on.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.349
Well, it doesn't work that way.

06:35.430 --> 06:36.671
Life isn't like that.

06:36.691 --> 06:37.613
It's much cooler.

06:37.653 --> 06:38.614
It's much harder.

06:39.616 --> 06:44.523
And, you know, somebody plays a prostitute on television.

06:44.543 --> 06:46.186
And she's glamorous.

06:46.907 --> 06:47.007
Yeah.

06:47.027 --> 06:49.411
You want to say, this is a disgusting trade.

06:49.431 --> 06:55.700
You know, most of the hookers are on drugs.

06:56.421 --> 07:00.087
And I thought, well, I am not going to... I mean, I had agents going at me.

07:00.438 --> 07:04.463
I had my publishers go and say, Linda, we want people to read this.

07:04.483 --> 07:06.285
This woman is too awful.

07:06.365 --> 07:07.146
We hate her.

07:08.147 --> 07:14.954
And a couple of times I did go back and go back to her and say, listen, you're going to have to give me something.

07:15.956 --> 07:16.716
They don't like you.

07:16.736 --> 07:17.938
And she said, I don't give a shit.

07:18.498 --> 07:24.926
And I said, well, you know, I've got to give a shit because, you know, I would like somebody to buy this book.

07:25.046 --> 07:25.927
So you did this on spec?

07:25.947 --> 07:27.389
You didn't have a contract on this?

07:27.409 --> 07:27.829
Yeah.

07:28.231 --> 07:28.972
You did or you didn't?

07:28.992 --> 07:39.081
Well, I had a contract, but I mean, they, you know, the way the publishing things work is I can submit my first manuscript and they can say they're not going to do it.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.843
That's right.

07:40.863 --> 07:41.423
Very easy.

07:41.463 --> 07:46.628
I know, I was with Random House and my book went to somebody else.

07:46.708 --> 07:50.872
I'm quite familiar with the problems of the publishing business.

07:50.972 --> 07:53.174
And now, even more so.

07:54.095 --> 07:55.656
I mean, now they are...

07:55.771 --> 07:56.552
Oh, they're nasty.

07:56.572 --> 08:00.476
They'll actually breach contracts, as they did with me.

08:00.636 --> 08:06.061
I mean, I could have sued the bastards, as a matter of fact.

08:06.101 --> 08:07.983
The money it takes to sue.

08:08.063 --> 08:10.705
And the reason they let me go is because there's so little money at stake.

08:12.507 --> 08:13.528
But I got the last laugh.

08:13.568 --> 08:16.030
My book's in its fifth printing, 50,000 copies.

08:16.991 --> 08:17.972
Really?

08:18.152 --> 08:19.153
Oh, that.

08:19.394 --> 08:23.938
Yeah, it was shorts listed for the National Book Critics Circle Award this year.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.914
Anyway, but we don't have to talk about my stuff.

08:27.034 --> 08:28.457
Oh, but that's what I love.

08:28.477 --> 08:30.921
But I really stuck it to them.

08:30.941 --> 08:32.523
And I kept the advance the first one.

08:32.844 --> 08:35.107
Oh, how wonderful.

08:35.127 --> 08:36.309
Good story.

08:36.870 --> 08:40.917
Briefly, this is important because I do write for about 30 papers or so.

08:41.498 --> 08:45.624
And one which is going to take me this summer is brand new and it's starting up in the Hamptons.

08:45.704 --> 08:46.526
And you live in the Hamptons.

08:46.546 --> 08:46.646
Yeah.

08:46.666 --> 08:47.808
It's called Country Magazine.

08:47.868 --> 08:47.968
Yeah.

08:49.079 --> 08:50.461
And it hasn't started yet.

08:50.501 --> 08:53.285
In fact, I'm starting with all the Cassini and then... Oh, really?

08:53.305 --> 08:56.009
So when I get something... I know you live out there, right?

08:56.109 --> 08:57.250
Yes, I live in East Hampton.

08:57.631 --> 08:58.552
Well, that's perfect.

08:58.852 --> 08:59.153
Yes.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.174
How long have you been there?

09:00.535 --> 09:01.276
Three years.

09:01.296 --> 09:01.796
No kidding.

09:01.816 --> 09:04.801
And is this your home or is this your American home?

09:04.861 --> 09:05.582
American home.

09:05.722 --> 09:07.604
And how often are you there?

09:07.644 --> 09:08.666
Summers?

09:08.726 --> 09:12.251
Summer, but I like Christmases there, actually, more than summer.

09:13.292 --> 09:14.714
I like to go off-season.

09:15.435 --> 09:18.259
I mean, season, it is really horrific there.

09:18.830 --> 09:23.096
But where I am, I'm so far removed from everything.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.419
It's just like a piece of paradise.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.161
It's so funny.

09:27.181 --> 09:29.264
It's good stuff, but I'll use this, so if you don't mind.

09:29.344 --> 09:30.425
No, not at all.

09:30.445 --> 09:35.272
And what is wonderful is people coming up.

09:35.292 --> 09:35.973
What a place to write.

09:36.193 --> 09:37.575
Look at the view.

09:37.755 --> 09:38.496
I write in a cupboard.

09:38.656 --> 09:39.698
I go down in a cellar.

09:39.738 --> 09:42.221
I write in a basement, surrounded by concrete.

09:42.241 --> 09:43.082
Yes, please.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.831
Because I can't find the light.

09:45.091 --> 09:47.294
You know, the sun is in, the sun and the sun.

09:47.314 --> 09:50.477
In fact, I have terrible eye trouble from the screen.

09:50.577 --> 09:51.779
Do you write on the screen?

09:52.199 --> 09:52.520
Yeah.

09:52.540 --> 09:53.961
The screen has ruined my eyes.

09:54.422 --> 09:54.742
Oh, man.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.804
I used to have fighter pilot eyes.

09:56.824 --> 09:59.928
I mean, I can't even pick up a dance like that.

09:59.948 --> 10:01.830
Yeah, mine are very bad at the moment.

10:01.850 --> 10:07.737
I did too much the last time I was there because I just come from Manhattan.

10:07.987 --> 10:09.990
Why do you have an American base now?

10:10.370 --> 10:16.479
I guess you've kind of... Well, to be truthful, I'm working a lot in America now.

10:16.940 --> 10:22.988
I've just wrapped on a TV series that I've finished for NBC called The Prosecutors.

10:24.270 --> 10:33.803
And what's wonderful about it is, you know, I didn't just launch into writing an American TV series straight off.

10:33.823 --> 10:34.264
You say...

10:34.565 --> 10:37.369
For me to get the American dialogue in that book right.

10:37.510 --> 10:38.111
And it's good.

10:38.131 --> 10:42.638
Oh, you know, it's a foreign language.

10:42.658 --> 10:49.248
And so I wasn't, you know, egotistical enough, which so many Brits are, that, you know, that they could just do it.

10:49.488 --> 10:52.132
Yeah, well, I just read a book by a Brit called The Grid.

10:52.212 --> 10:52.954
Have you heard of it?

10:53.334 --> 10:53.775
Excuse me.

10:53.795 --> 10:54.176
Let's see.

10:54.256 --> 10:56.980
It's called, it's about a building that goes crazy in L.A.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.003
by Philip Kerr, K-E-R-R.

10:59.422 --> 11:01.324
Young man, it's going to be a big book.

11:01.344 --> 11:05.148
It's like a computer goes crazy and kills people.

11:05.168 --> 11:07.070
And his American dialogue is terrible.

11:07.090 --> 11:10.554
I mean, he uses, basically, it's when he uses the fuck word.

11:10.634 --> 11:16.360
It's just so tinny when it's not used the way an American would use it.

11:16.601 --> 11:23.108
So I was really impressed that you did kind of get the nuances.

11:23.128 --> 11:24.309
It took a long time.

11:24.549 --> 11:29.074
And also, I think I was helped because of having her there.

11:30.083 --> 11:41.914
But when I did a TV series, I joined forces with Tor Frontana, who writes and produces Homicide.

11:43.776 --> 11:53.806
And my director, who I also work very closely with for the show, is Rod Holcomb, who produced the first and directed the first DR. You're writing these?

11:53.886 --> 11:55.307
Yes, with them.

11:55.327 --> 11:58.150
So it's a pilot.

11:58.619 --> 12:05.851
just wrapped last week, starring Stockard Channing, and a lovely actress called Michelle Forbes.

12:06.632 --> 12:08.275
It's decidedly American?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.657
It's prosecuted.

12:09.677 --> 12:15.106
Well, I mean, you're prosecuted in the UK too, but it's an American basis.

12:15.126 --> 12:15.226
Yeah.

12:15.747 --> 12:17.129
Oh, totally an American show.

12:18.552 --> 12:19.393
Because you're prime suspect.

12:19.954 --> 12:20.635
Yeah.

12:21.597 --> 12:24.762
I saw it, and it's very interesting to me because

12:26.328 --> 12:30.552
You know, it doesn't like to be biased, which one, of course, when you see your own work.

12:31.373 --> 12:34.235
But it does have a wonderful quality to it, this one.

12:34.376 --> 12:38.900
It doesn't feel like American TV.

12:40.321 --> 12:44.825
It just allows an emotion to go a good length through it.

12:45.646 --> 12:53.854
You know, you don't... If somebody dies and you don't have the person, the next scene, recovered, you see...

12:54.323 --> 13:02.732
the anguish and grief of death, what it does to people, what it does to every person in the street, and yet so they can sit and watch TV and go, oh.

13:02.752 --> 13:04.974
Is this in the writing, or is this in the direction, would you say?

13:05.054 --> 13:06.355
In the writing and the direction.

13:06.395 --> 13:12.682
I mean, Tom and I, and Julie, there are three writers, Tom Fontana, Julie Martin, and myself.

13:13.583 --> 13:21.411
We, I mean, this script has taken a long time to get to the point it's at.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.983
But it's based on a concept that I had.

13:26.464 --> 13:30.389
And we just threw it around with each other.

13:30.749 --> 13:31.070
Love it.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.011
Oh, great people.

13:32.091 --> 13:33.533
Now, you mentioned three writers.

13:33.833 --> 13:37.637
Obviously, one of the joys of writing a book is that... You ain't got anybody but yourself.

13:37.717 --> 13:44.285
There's one writer, and you don't have some producer saying, like you're saying here, Jesus, she's awfully bad.

13:44.325 --> 13:47.288
Can you gussy her up a little bit?

13:47.509 --> 13:48.170
You don't have that.

13:48.710 --> 13:49.391
That's what I like.

13:49.451 --> 13:50.352
That's why...

13:50.990 --> 14:04.471
I like to do a novel a year for that specific reason, because I can cut away from everything, just go and sit and... In that plain room, by yourself.

14:04.491 --> 14:10.501
Yes, in that room, and I don't have to... I mean, I recently did a script for Sean Connery.

14:12.264 --> 14:13.245
One of my favorites.

14:14.207 --> 14:17.672
I mean, he's a wonderful, a wonderful guy.

14:18.074 --> 14:25.723
But I'm surrounded by people that all want to put in their ideas.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.007
I came in, actually, to rewrite a script.

14:30.429 --> 14:40.842
And I said to them at one point, I said, you know, if I put in everything that you've just asked me for, I've got, you know, the hard book of William Shakespeare.

14:40.862 --> 14:47.490
I said, I can't put in... So you've got all these people that say, and I think it would be great if he has no relationship...

14:47.926 --> 14:49.869
With, you know, his ex-wife.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.213
You want a relationship with the ex-wife, right?

14:53.233 --> 14:55.416
And he's got a wonderful relationship with his daughter.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.700
Wonderful relationship with his daughter.

14:59.001 --> 15:02.145
And we're talking about a two-hour... And they're talking about a movie.

15:02.165 --> 15:03.927
120-page script or something like that.

15:04.187 --> 15:09.474
Because they don't understand that you can't just put in a theme in a relationship.

15:09.715 --> 15:10.456
You've got to build it.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.597
You have to explain to the audience.

15:11.617 --> 15:13.360
It has to have some validity to what's going on.

15:13.380 --> 15:13.820
Oh, man.

15:14.861 --> 15:15.723
Hours just takes.

15:16.103 --> 15:17.545
So then they get the script in.

15:18.098 --> 15:25.487
And then I get to wait for the studio, and you get these messages.

15:26.908 --> 15:29.471
Well, they're going to come back to us.

15:29.491 --> 15:33.696
They're a bit worried about it.

15:33.716 --> 15:35.959
This is quite a business, though, isn't it?

15:35.979 --> 15:40.884
You profess considerable respect, apparently, for the Hollywood professionals, I guess.

15:41.906 --> 15:42.727
Yeah, I do.

15:42.747 --> 15:43.988
Because they are...

15:44.423 --> 15:48.370
I did an interview with Michael Corda, you know, and he said, you know, these people make millions of dollars.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.552
I hate him, though.

15:49.752 --> 15:50.393
I hate him, too.

15:50.413 --> 15:52.036
He's doing this thing on his prostate.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.098
Give me a break.

15:53.478 --> 15:56.363
What an excuse to write a book.

15:56.383 --> 15:57.645
Did you hear anything about his prostate?

15:57.665 --> 16:00.811
He's read a thing about his... Anyway.

16:00.911 --> 16:03.575
He is a very vicious man.

16:03.595 --> 16:04.116
Yeah.

16:04.136 --> 16:06.841
And he absolutely blocks new writers.

16:07.362 --> 16:08.483
He hates them.

16:08.503 --> 16:10.026
No, because I think he sees...

16:11.170 --> 16:13.112
rivals or something.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.276
I know of a number of writers that that man is doing.

16:16.296 --> 16:26.769
Well, my editor at Holt is a young man by the name of Alan Peacock, who is one of the finest editors in America, was fired by Simon & Schuster for no reason beyond the fact that he cared about literary stuff.

16:27.670 --> 16:32.436
Anyway, we don't need any of that stuff.

16:32.838 --> 16:37.566
Let's talk about your own fascination for the thriller genre.

16:37.646 --> 16:43.996
It is unusual, I guess, for a woman to be so proficient in this, although it's changed a bit in recent years.

16:44.457 --> 16:50.487
Yeah, except, you know, you say that, but in fact, you know, you go back to Agatha Christie.

16:50.507 --> 16:52.590
But you couldn't call those thrillers, though.

16:52.610 --> 16:57.478
I think, I mean, some people would say that the Agatha Christie was the kind of beginning of the genre.

16:57.627 --> 16:59.069
of the thriller.

16:59.209 --> 17:02.014
I mean, this is basically seed of the pants stuff, too.

17:02.394 --> 17:09.585
Yeah, but I mean, you know, why did Agatha Christie, this kind of pristine middle-class woman, do it?

17:10.206 --> 17:22.625
I mean, I do it because since I was this high, I can remember weeping down on my knees because my father wouldn't let me see Elliot Ness.

17:22.645 --> 17:23.787
I was weeping.

17:24.070 --> 17:53.284
because i love that show yeah and uh oh murder mystery suspense i love sitting watching it's it's piecing it together that i like and i also like making the jug the jigsaw when you do and also i've discovered this over and over and over that fact is a hell of a lot better than fiction look at the unibama story i mean

17:53.416 --> 17:55.438
you take that as an example.

17:55.478 --> 18:06.371
But you don't just, I mean, to me in something like that, the fascination in that is where did that strange seed come from for both of them?

18:06.671 --> 18:09.214
You know, the ordinary family.

18:09.234 --> 18:11.436
Because the David story is just as good or better.

18:12.177 --> 18:14.380
Yeah, on the leave that lived underneath a rock.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.664
And you think, wait a minute, there's more, there's always more.

18:18.845 --> 18:21.027
You just scratch the surface.

18:21.547 --> 18:26.994
But there's also, to me, what's fascinating is the peripheral of that.

18:27.014 --> 18:30.498
We had the letters to the Mexicans.

18:31.039 --> 18:33.462
But also... No, Mama.

18:33.482 --> 18:33.862
Mommy.

18:33.902 --> 18:37.186
The mother's letters to the editor, and the father's suicide.

18:37.226 --> 18:40.190
There's a lot of stuff here.

18:40.210 --> 18:40.831
Wonderful story.

18:40.851 --> 18:46.818
But at the same time, how long does it take for somebody... Do you mind if I say something?

18:46.838 --> 18:47.178
No, please.

18:47.218 --> 18:49.461
How long does it take for somebody

18:51.382 --> 18:57.452
I mean, this man has been killing for ten years.

18:58.213 --> 18:59.135
Eighteen, actually.

18:59.295 --> 19:09.592
Eighteen, but actually... Well, I mean, the bombs have been working well for the last ten, but it certainly wasn't for lack of effort.

19:09.612 --> 19:12.156
He didn't grow with experience, did he?

19:12.637 --> 19:16.343
But it has been put out how many times?

19:16.897 --> 19:18.618
the experience this man must have.

19:19.799 --> 19:23.142
Profiler said, you know, he's probably a highly educated guy.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.023
Right on.

19:24.043 --> 19:25.044
The profile was absolutely on.

19:25.384 --> 19:28.127
In fact, his name should have kicked out of the database out of Berkeley.

19:28.647 --> 19:29.288
Absolutely.

19:29.788 --> 19:30.409
Should it have?

19:30.469 --> 19:31.169
Absolutely.

19:31.189 --> 19:31.810
It really should have.

19:32.290 --> 19:34.993
It amazes me that it didn't, that they were actually looking at Berkeley.

19:35.013 --> 19:35.233
Absolutely.

19:36.194 --> 19:38.716
That name, this guy quit without explanation.

19:39.496 --> 19:40.597
And disappeared.

19:40.718 --> 19:41.738
And everybody says he's a crazy guy.

19:42.699 --> 19:42.999
Yeah.

19:43.020 --> 19:43.560
Up in the woods.

19:43.740 --> 19:44.281
Yeah.

19:44.301 --> 19:45.121
How many people up in the woods?

19:45.141 --> 19:45.942
How many people...

19:46.158 --> 19:49.664
that knew that guy that he used to be at Barclay.

19:49.684 --> 19:53.990
How many people was he a professor to at Barclay that would know?

19:54.671 --> 20:01.162
But it's like the clues are always right in your face.

20:01.222 --> 20:04.287
That's the most wonderful part of it, isn't it?

20:04.487 --> 20:06.110
Are you alert to this when you're writing?

20:07.251 --> 20:14.022
And that must be the challenge then, to make it... In the very first thing I wrote for TV,

20:15.655 --> 20:26.190
I had a clue that I fought for it to be as hidden as I could have it.

20:26.651 --> 20:32.039
And it was a woman questioning another woman.

20:32.419 --> 20:34.022
First off, she says, will you have a cigarette?

20:34.062 --> 20:35.584
She says, I don't smoke.

20:35.604 --> 20:37.887
And she goes and she finds an ashtray like this full of cigarettes.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.092
So she knows somebody in that house has been smoking.

20:42.394 --> 20:44.717
And this woman's husband

20:44.883 --> 20:45.784
had been murdered.

20:46.885 --> 20:55.213
And then she gets her own cigarette and she looks in her bag, she's looking for a lighter.

20:57.095 --> 21:03.141
And a smoker will usually look for a cigarette ashtray if they're in somebody's home.

21:03.201 --> 21:04.262
Do you mind if I smoke?

21:04.282 --> 21:06.504
So they go for the ashtray, logically.

21:07.585 --> 21:10.468
And suddenly by this ashtray was a lighter.

21:12.727 --> 21:20.337
And all you saw the woman do was reach for the lighter, her hand almost, and she came back as if she'd been burnt.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.902
And she suddenly said, I have to go.

21:24.503 --> 21:25.224
I have to go.

21:25.985 --> 21:33.095
So the clue, that lighter, they kept saying, oh, shouldn't we have close-up lighter?

21:33.115 --> 21:35.418
Shouldn't we have a pick-it-up, look at it?

21:35.438 --> 21:36.900
So I said, no.

21:36.920 --> 21:41.647
And do you know how fast that audience picked it up?

21:41.667 --> 21:41.987
Right away.

21:42.228 --> 21:42.548
Bang!

21:43.000 --> 21:49.688
The public are by far more intelligent than we ever give credit.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.074
I give major credit to how fast they pick up stuff.

21:54.714 --> 22:00.442
But I have producers that go, no, don't you think they need more?

22:00.482 --> 22:03.245
I say, what do you mean by they need more?

22:03.265 --> 22:03.986
Who do you think?

22:04.687 --> 22:06.769
Don't worry about that.

22:06.789 --> 22:08.351
I used to love cigars.

22:08.912 --> 22:11.335
Actually, I like the smoke.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.957
But the audacity of this

22:13.190 --> 22:16.454
a band of people, and often they're terribly lonely.

22:16.474 --> 22:24.643
You want to say, look, what if you don't tell me what they can and they can't do out there?

22:24.663 --> 22:25.003
It's furious.

22:25.964 --> 22:32.191
So I kind of safeguard myself by saying, ah, gotcha, because that's true.

22:33.372 --> 22:36.035
That's what happened.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.339
I'm still interested in the story.

22:39.379 --> 22:42.522
She recoiled because there was a truth there that she said.

22:42.907 --> 23:12.525
and everybody in the audience knew they just knew and it turned into a terrible darkness the way she reacted in the spiral after now you started you trained to be an actress yeah and of course the focus there was a performance what was it that occasioned your

23:13.147 --> 23:19.535
your move to the creative, well, not to say that it's not a creative enterprise, but the writing.

23:19.555 --> 23:24.641
Well, I'd actually always written from the eye.

23:24.661 --> 23:28.126
And I think I was scared of it, really.

23:28.166 --> 23:29.868
Scared of what, the writing?

23:29.888 --> 23:30.028
Yeah.

23:30.268 --> 23:31.950
Why?

23:32.731 --> 23:34.293
I suffered badly from dyslexia.

23:35.034 --> 23:39.700
And so sometimes I knew my stuff was incomprehensible.

23:41.402 --> 23:42.023
And...

23:43.133 --> 23:45.096
But just the shyness about it.

23:45.416 --> 23:47.279
I want to show it to people.

23:47.299 --> 23:54.850
And then I, because I predominantly worked as a stage actress, I only ever centered my work on the stage.

23:54.870 --> 24:01.759
And I did two plays that I would say were not just... You mean you wrote or you preferred it?

24:01.779 --> 24:02.781
I wrote.

24:02.801 --> 24:07.448
They were... I mean, you wouldn't believe it.

24:07.468 --> 24:08.749
When was this?

24:08.769 --> 24:12.735
This would be about the 80s, early 80s.

24:14.352 --> 24:17.276
But again, you know, there's this odd mind.

24:17.757 --> 24:26.910
Why does somebody working in London and born in Liverpool write a play about Billy the Kid?

24:26.930 --> 24:33.039
You know, in the end, Salafi, the brain, of all the... But off I went, I went and researched Billy the Kid.

24:33.059 --> 24:34.341
I was obsessed by Billy the Kid.

24:35.603 --> 24:40.630
Because the reason I was obsessed by Billy the Kid was I picked up a book in an antique shop

24:43.023 --> 24:44.465
and it described Billy the Kid.

24:45.846 --> 24:52.574
And I thought, my God, there's the Sam Peckinpah film with Chris Christopherson.

24:53.996 --> 24:56.519
And then I began to think, who else has played Billy the Kid?

24:57.360 --> 25:03.186
In reality, Michael J. Pollard was the closest to him because he was tiny, he was five foot two.

25:04.488 --> 25:05.589
Miniscule little guy.

25:06.430 --> 25:12.237
And the more I dug into and found these information about Billy the Kid, I became obsessed by him.

25:12.368 --> 25:16.915
So was he grotesque in the way that you visualized it?

25:18.277 --> 25:21.241
No, I think he must have been fascinating.

25:21.382 --> 25:25.508
You mentioned the Pollock.

25:25.528 --> 25:29.935
He was the closest to what it would have been like in that era then anyway.

25:30.696 --> 25:36.044
But the extraordinary cases I found we'd been picked up.

25:36.084 --> 25:41.312
I mean, once he was picked up for dressing with a barmaid, and you think, how come this has never been...

25:41.663 --> 25:45.147
It doesn't fit into the gunslinger.

25:45.187 --> 25:46.569
I wrote this thing on Benedictine.

25:46.949 --> 25:50.854
It was slaughtered.

25:50.874 --> 25:54.578
But Ken Russell actually saw it.

25:54.598 --> 25:55.439
I don't know why.

25:55.740 --> 25:56.701
What was the name of it?

25:56.721 --> 25:59.884
It was called Benedictine.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.287
Was it a comedy?

26:02.387 --> 26:05.091
No.

26:05.151 --> 26:06.272
Sometimes it was a musical.

26:06.312 --> 26:09.696
It was odd.

26:10.013 --> 26:11.395
So they killed it, right?

26:11.415 --> 26:13.097
The critics killed it?

26:13.117 --> 26:15.240
Beyond, kill it.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.322
I mean, they annihilated this one.

26:17.342 --> 26:18.324
They blasted this with it.

26:18.724 --> 26:23.851
But Ken Russell said to me, he said, you have one minute in that play.

26:23.991 --> 26:25.212
It was three hours long, by the way.

26:25.873 --> 26:26.234
One minute.

26:26.274 --> 26:27.996
No place should be three hours long.

26:28.176 --> 26:28.817
Sheer brilliance.

26:28.917 --> 26:31.801
And I said, oh, thank you very much.

26:31.821 --> 26:33.663
But that, I don't know, one minute.

26:34.424 --> 26:35.605
Three hours is long.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.708
Oh, it was, well, everything was wrong, actually.

26:38.498 --> 26:43.363
So I would go back to saying, you know, I'm an actress, I have no intention of writing.

26:43.383 --> 26:56.117
And what was odd as an actress, you know, I was playing, you know, great leading roles on stage, and then I got for a TV play, and they'd say, could you tell us what you've been doing?

26:58.039 --> 27:01.683
And I'd say, well, I'm just playing Reagan, King Lear.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.206
You don't even know, you'd have to say King Lear for them.

27:04.226 --> 27:05.147
And they go, yes.

27:05.937 --> 27:13.327
And before that, I played in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Comet at the Royal Shakespeare Company.

27:14.969 --> 27:16.171
Would you mind reading this?

27:16.291 --> 27:19.776
And they'll give you five lines of a prostitute.

27:19.796 --> 27:35.657
And I think there comes a point in an actress's life where, really, if you get to 30 and you ain't cracked it, no matter how good you are, every script you get has got an awful lot of fingerprints over it before it gets to you.

27:36.650 --> 28:05.256
and uh i think by contrast interrupt i think that whomever gets the role for which undoubtedly will be a film treatment out of this will be a woman who's who's probably had a few films behind her oh has to yes yeah i mean it should be very i would imagine it's very attractive to some yeah but they'll be scared of it they'll be scared of it but i don't think they're going to make her look the way you visualize her in your mind either but uh

28:06.518 --> 28:09.962
I think also it's a very odd thing.

28:10.022 --> 28:19.054
You can get a male hero who has a drink problem and has been beat up and is beat up, but that's attractive.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.295
Well, it's charming, maybe.

28:21.277 --> 28:21.757
But it is.

28:22.078 --> 28:30.168
I mean, there's a kind of, you know, you can get... I mean, every Dutch Leonard character is flawed to some degree.

28:30.188 --> 28:31.910
He's more or less the cleanest of the dirty.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.433
Yeah, but all the women must be flawed.

28:34.818 --> 28:36.861
Must not be flawed.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.925
So if you begin with a flawed kind, I mean, it's the same in Prime Suspects.

28:39.945 --> 28:40.706
She was flawed.

28:41.166 --> 28:44.150
And I think a lot of people thought, oh, at last.

28:44.871 --> 28:49.577
But, I mean, Helen Miriam had a tremendous, her own natural sensuality.

28:49.597 --> 28:53.162
She was a very sensual woman.

28:53.783 --> 29:03.255
And I think the mould, to break the mould, that you don't have to be 25 and look astonishing to be attractive to the opposite sex was...

29:03.927 --> 29:07.691
You know, it seemed sad, but it was a breakthrough.

29:11.135 --> 29:17.982
And for me, writing... I started out of frustration, I'd say.

29:19.263 --> 29:24.669
And I was actually playing a prostitute in a show.

29:24.769 --> 29:29.034
One of those long-running, you know, detective series on TV.

29:29.054 --> 29:32.037
And I had ridiculous lines to say.

29:32.077 --> 29:33.799
I never get one of the lines.

29:35.247 --> 29:40.572
The main lead of this show was coming to see me about my child.

29:42.513 --> 29:44.095
And she said, look, I'm a mother.

29:44.815 --> 29:45.876
Can't we just sit and talk?

29:47.117 --> 29:47.618
Wonderful.

29:48.799 --> 29:51.321
She said, look, call me Maggie.

29:51.341 --> 29:54.324
And my line was, oh, call me Juanita.

29:54.344 --> 29:59.208
Now, there was no reference into the script as why I was called Juanita.

29:59.728 --> 30:00.629
Q-U-A-N-I-T-A.

30:01.050 --> 30:01.330
Yes.

30:01.790 --> 30:04.152
So I said, could somebody tell me why I'm Juanita?

30:04.513 --> 30:04.933
Am I...

30:05.133 --> 30:07.075
You know, where am I from?

30:07.095 --> 30:09.677
You know, I was East End, London.

30:09.697 --> 30:12.219
No, I had to keep the Juanita.

30:12.599 --> 30:13.921
Well, I could never say the line.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.482
I just got hysterical.

30:16.323 --> 30:21.988
So at the end of the rehearsals one day, I said, could I have a go at writing one of these?

30:23.829 --> 30:28.013
And they said, yeah, sure, we're very sure to... Yeah, an episode.

30:28.033 --> 30:33.958
So I went home and it was like... Brought out some treatments.

30:34.394 --> 30:40.283
and I sent them off, and they were all rejected, but one had scrawled in pretzels.

30:40.323 --> 30:41.846
This is brilliant.

30:41.866 --> 30:42.507
Don't know who did it.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.792
Could be the cleaning lady, somebody.

30:47.194 --> 30:49.437
And... This is the start for you?

30:49.678 --> 30:50.619
That was the start.

30:51.240 --> 30:51.961
I looked at it.

30:51.981 --> 30:53.323
What was the name of the series?

30:53.464 --> 30:53.924
Widows.

30:55.467 --> 30:57.269
And it was a monster hit.

30:57.430 --> 31:00.274
A monster hit.

31:00.294 --> 31:02.157
It was... Eighties?

31:02.609 --> 31:03.410
Yes.

31:03.931 --> 31:10.321
It became a landmark for drama in England because... Are these soaps?

31:10.822 --> 31:13.786
No, this was like a six hour mini.

31:15.489 --> 31:23.422
And it was the first time they'd ever had a series that starred five women without a male lead.

31:23.922 --> 31:25.104
Were they all widows?

31:25.124 --> 31:25.365
Yes.

31:27.127 --> 31:29.511
But they were a specific kind of widow.

31:30.773 --> 31:39.785
You opened the show with this big armed robbery going down, and the men were going to use explosives in the robbery, and they blew themselves up.

31:40.626 --> 31:53.042
So in the three titles, you saw these guys pulling the masks on, getting ready to go, and then you were slowly introduced to each widow at each funeral.

31:53.483 --> 31:58.890
And you saw the high rock, and you saw the big mama whose husband was the main man.

31:59.107 --> 32:01.270
down to the kind of real low life.

32:02.752 --> 32:08.401
And she was insane.

32:08.561 --> 32:12.527
She couldn't grieve for him, she worshipped him.

32:12.547 --> 32:20.899
And she went and got each one of the women, sat them down because she found the plants and she said, we're going to do the robbery.

32:20.919 --> 32:23.022
And so the whole series was about the training.

32:23.862 --> 32:25.024
Well, that sounds pretty good.

32:25.044 --> 32:31.793
Of the women, and the fights in between with the women, and eventually they pull... So which one did you rewrite?

32:31.833 --> 32:33.175
Which episode of this?

32:33.355 --> 32:34.457
That was all mine, that was mine.

32:34.477 --> 32:35.498
Oh, the whole thing was yours?

32:35.518 --> 32:36.059
Yes, that was mine.

32:36.079 --> 32:36.340
Oh, wow.

32:37.261 --> 32:45.913
So, I originally based the first little treatment on a woman in a market.

32:45.933 --> 32:50.239
And when I was out of work, I used to do market stores.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.182
And the woman next to me

32:53.022 --> 32:56.927
was, here, you, put that, I'll give you one, you'll come back.

32:56.947 --> 32:58.068
She'd punch anybody.

32:58.088 --> 33:03.715
And then somebody said to me, I know her husband.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.638
He's in prison for 18 years.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.881
I'm a robber.

33:07.901 --> 33:09.783
So that's where the seed began.

33:10.023 --> 33:19.615
And I went to her one day and I said, would you help me, give me some information.

33:20.556 --> 33:21.898
I want to write this thing on

33:22.705 --> 33:24.787
armed robbery and these women.

33:25.408 --> 33:26.609
And she said, what do you mean, help you?

33:27.370 --> 33:27.950
What do you mean?

33:28.871 --> 33:30.313
What do you think I am, huh?

33:30.853 --> 33:31.834
You want me to help you?

33:31.895 --> 33:33.917
What are you talking about?

33:34.918 --> 33:38.842
I said, well, I was wondering, you know, because I don't know that world.

33:39.422 --> 33:40.463
He said, what, you want my world?

33:40.483 --> 33:41.404
You want to know about my world?

33:41.685 --> 33:42.966
Why do you want to know about my world?

33:42.986 --> 33:43.887
Why don't you just piss off?

33:44.047 --> 33:45.789
Go on, fuck off.

33:45.809 --> 33:51.615
So I kept going back and saying, look, I don't mean to be rude to you.

33:51.950 --> 33:56.196
So she said, all right, I'll tell you what, come back for a cup of tea.

33:56.757 --> 34:02.625
Now, I'd known and worked with this woman off and on in the markets for maybe a year and a half.

34:03.626 --> 34:12.558
And I went to her home, elegant, sophisticated, antiques, and I thought, I don't know this woman at all.

34:12.578 --> 34:18.987
But because the voice and the manner was this tough, crude woman, there was a hidden side.

34:19.912 --> 34:22.237
So she said, you should go see my husband.

34:24.461 --> 34:28.569
And bit by bit, yeah, it started to form.

34:28.589 --> 34:33.499
So then she would introduce me to more women that were involved in the peripheral of crime.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.563
Was she beginning to enjoy this?

34:35.583 --> 34:36.925
Yeah.

34:36.945 --> 34:41.835
And then one day I called her and she said, I'm sorry I'm busy, listen, she said,

34:42.136 --> 34:44.580
Again, this is for the widows thing again?

34:44.600 --> 34:44.940
Yes.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.003
So she said, I can't waste any more of my time.

34:47.023 --> 34:49.988
Now, had you done this all prior to the writing of the segment?

34:50.629 --> 34:52.832
No, I just wrote a treatment.

34:52.892 --> 34:54.935
But you did this research afterwards?

34:54.975 --> 34:56.077
Yes, after the treatment.

34:56.117 --> 34:57.198
I sold the treatment.

34:57.218 --> 34:57.899
I see.

34:57.919 --> 34:59.161
Then I had to do the work.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.625
I see.

35:02.126 --> 35:03.608
The treatment is more or less like a proposal.

35:03.628 --> 35:04.669
A couple of lines, yes.

35:04.750 --> 35:09.156
And she said, I can't work with you, I'm too busy.

35:10.992 --> 35:17.186
And so that's when I went to her and I said, look, I am prepared to pay you for your time.

35:18.088 --> 35:19.491
And that's when it started.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.633
She said, deal done.

35:23.058 --> 35:29.693
And so that's how I started because from then on she would be very agreeing to see me because I paid her.

35:30.483 --> 35:33.147
I mean, as you went?

35:33.167 --> 35:34.008
Yes, I went along.

35:34.269 --> 35:35.551
That was the first casting.

35:35.571 --> 35:38.655
You paid her after a recession?

35:39.136 --> 35:39.476
Yes.

35:39.496 --> 35:47.028
So then one of the guys that was in the robbery, his wife or his girlfriend was a prostitute.

35:48.550 --> 35:49.351
That's a great story.

35:49.371 --> 35:51.755
So I said, do you know any prostitutes?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.317
She said, what do you mean I know any prostitutes?

35:53.337 --> 35:54.819
What do you think I am, eh?

35:54.939 --> 35:55.660
I know prostitutes?

35:55.680 --> 35:56.401
Fuck off.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.144
Then the next day she said, look, all right, I'll tell you what.

35:58.647 --> 36:00.009
Go over to my friend.

36:00.089 --> 36:01.731
She'll introduce you.

36:01.751 --> 36:03.493
And then I met another person.

36:03.694 --> 36:04.515
Can you nail this down?

36:04.575 --> 36:06.658
When exactly this was for me?

36:06.958 --> 36:08.500
Well, the show came out in 1983.

36:10.022 --> 36:12.345
And it's still talked about.

36:12.625 --> 36:16.190
And how long did it take you to... I'm just going to check the timer.

36:16.951 --> 36:17.372
To write.

36:17.732 --> 36:19.374
To do the work, not just to write.

36:19.935 --> 36:20.696
Oh, about six months.

36:23.059 --> 36:27.064
But it was the biggest lesson in my life because... And it was called Widows.

36:27.184 --> 36:27.625
Widows.

36:28.465 --> 36:36.897
And what happened, because it was such a success in England, it was bought outright by Disney Studios.

36:37.919 --> 36:39.541
And they brought me over.

36:40.062 --> 36:41.083
Here.

36:41.103 --> 36:42.926
To Hollywood.

36:42.946 --> 36:50.156
And so there you've got, I mean, it's difficult to imagine, but you've got an actress that hankered after Hollywood.

36:50.176 --> 36:51.959
All her career as an actress.

36:51.979 --> 36:57.086
And suddenly I am first class in the Beverly Hills.

36:57.627 --> 36:58.168
And I mean,

36:58.368 --> 36:58.989
As a writer?

36:59.450 --> 37:00.211
As a writer.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.977
I've got the roses, I've got the fruit, the champagne.

37:04.718 --> 37:09.565
And I think, it was like magic time.

37:10.306 --> 37:11.608
And I was so dumb.

37:12.329 --> 37:14.172
I had no idea what the hell was going on.

37:14.192 --> 37:17.137
They kept ringing up and saying, oh, your car isn't coming for you today.

37:17.157 --> 37:18.959
I said, that's okay, because I was by the pool.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.423
Paid holiday.

37:21.443 --> 37:24.628
And then eventually I went to see Katzenberg at Disney.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.881
You were brought over to do new stuff, right?

37:28.921 --> 37:33.809
They wanted me to do the movie of Widows, in Hollywood.

37:33.829 --> 37:34.810
And was it produced?

37:35.391 --> 37:42.102
No, because when I got there, I discovered this extraordinary thing.

37:42.142 --> 37:48.652
They had bought this, but nobody had read it, and nobody had looked at the video.

37:50.294 --> 37:53.940
And so I went in to

37:54.410 --> 37:56.292
talk to the heads of the studio.

37:57.393 --> 38:00.396
And they said to me, would you pitch it?

38:02.218 --> 38:02.978
I said, pitch what?

38:04.440 --> 38:05.661
I said, I've been here three days.

38:05.721 --> 38:07.463
They said, would you pitch Widows?

38:08.243 --> 38:09.745
I said, well, haven't you read it?

38:10.606 --> 38:15.551
I couldn't believe that they'd outbidded every single studio.

38:15.971 --> 38:18.093
But that's what I understand about them.

38:18.794 --> 38:20.756
So I said, oh, so you want the story?

38:21.396 --> 38:22.257
So they said, yes.

38:23.080 --> 38:27.886
So because I'd never done a pitch before, I thought they wanted the whole story.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.749
So I reenacted the six hours.

38:31.831 --> 38:35.295
They were sitting there and kind of... In a stupor, huh?

38:35.535 --> 38:38.379
In a stupor, and I said, and then she comes and she gets by the door.

38:38.799 --> 38:39.701
I did the deaths.

38:40.762 --> 38:42.104
Well, you learned something, didn't you?

38:42.304 --> 38:47.831
And at the end of it, Jeffrey Katzenberg said to me, where are the laughs?

38:48.732 --> 38:49.893
I said, what do you mean, where are the laughs?

38:49.913 --> 38:50.975
He said, it's a drama.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.176
He said, it isn't a comedy.

38:52.814 --> 38:53.775
Jesus Christ.

38:53.815 --> 38:56.678
I said, no, it's a drama.

38:56.698 --> 38:58.780
And he said, but is this the thing we bought for Bette Midler?

39:00.362 --> 39:01.343
Wow.

39:01.363 --> 39:02.083
Never was done.

39:03.265 --> 39:03.885
Never touched.

39:03.905 --> 39:06.047
Did you get paid, right?

39:06.067 --> 39:06.127
No.

39:06.147 --> 39:06.608
You didn't get paid.

39:06.628 --> 39:07.369
No, I was off.

39:07.869 --> 39:08.350
I was out.

39:08.890 --> 39:09.971
Back on the next plane.

39:09.991 --> 39:10.812
You had a nice trip, though.

39:10.832 --> 39:11.433
Yeah, I had a holiday.

39:12.594 --> 39:18.100
But... But you learned that you kind of liked it on that side of the... Hell, yes.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.581
I could move in there.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.703
So when was your first book?

39:21.903 --> 39:23.125
When did you write your first book?

39:24.887 --> 39:32.939
Well, what was odd was after Widows, which was, as I said, a huge success.

39:32.959 --> 39:33.740
On television?

39:33.760 --> 39:35.442
Yeah.

39:35.462 --> 39:45.557
Came seven years of rejection because everybody kept commissioning a script, but basically they wanted another Widows.

39:47.039 --> 39:48.741
And because I wouldn't write another one,

39:49.649 --> 39:51.291
I just got rejected on everything.

39:52.232 --> 39:54.394
So this brings us up to about 1990 then, right?

39:54.994 --> 39:55.235
Yeah.

39:56.856 --> 40:00.660
And midway of that, I was so broke, I was going to go back into acting.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.782
So you've basically taken off in the last five or six years?

40:02.802 --> 40:03.122
Yeah.

40:04.604 --> 40:08.168
And I was approached by somebody and they said, would you like to write a book?

40:08.628 --> 40:15.535
I mean, I was so desperate for money that if they'd said, would you like to write, you know, a book on the football stadium, I'd have said yes.

40:17.056 --> 40:19.639
And so I wrote my first book.

40:19.754 --> 40:24.778
And I love the fact that they commissioned it, I wrote it, they did it.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.560
This was a publisher that came to you?

40:26.580 --> 40:26.840
Yeah.

40:26.860 --> 40:28.302
A British publisher, American?

40:28.882 --> 40:29.843
Pan Macmillan.

40:29.863 --> 40:30.824
And the title was?

40:31.504 --> 40:32.085
The Legacy.

40:32.185 --> 40:33.466
And was it published here?

40:33.586 --> 40:33.786
No.

40:34.187 --> 40:39.211
It was bought by Salmon & Schuster, Michael Corder, and he blocked it.

40:41.433 --> 40:43.635
But then, since then, I've done a book a year.

40:44.416 --> 40:46.157
For Random?

40:46.338 --> 40:49.120
Macmillan in England and Random is my new one here.

40:49.268 --> 40:51.030
I was first with William Morrow.

40:51.070 --> 40:53.313
It's just really come upon hard times.

40:53.734 --> 40:54.975
Yeah, yes.

40:55.056 --> 40:55.676
I think I helped.

40:58.240 --> 41:02.145
But that's how the book started, that I needed them.

41:02.385 --> 41:02.826
I'm sorry.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.830
I'm sorry, I interrupted.

41:05.910 --> 41:07.291
That's how the book started?

41:07.392 --> 41:09.314
Yeah, that I needed them badly.

41:09.434 --> 41:12.518
That you needed them badly.

41:13.039 --> 41:15.462
And everything that you do,

41:16.100 --> 41:19.904
the authenticity, the verisimilitude as to use it.

41:21.106 --> 41:23.028
It goes back to the first time I wrote.

41:23.188 --> 41:25.711
But you really feel that you have to go out and get the real goods.

41:26.391 --> 41:31.857
Yes, because it's a great safety net.

41:31.877 --> 41:36.402
Because if somebody says to me, oh, this is a bit coincidental, isn't it?

41:36.683 --> 41:39.225
I say, pardon?

41:39.245 --> 41:39.726
It's true.

41:40.767 --> 41:46.073
See, you can't slam me for anything

41:46.492 --> 41:47.814
Because I can come back at you.

41:47.834 --> 41:50.298
You can say, listen, I don't think this is well written.

41:50.318 --> 41:51.019
That's my fault.

41:52.521 --> 41:54.865
But to say it didn't happen or it couldn't happen.

41:54.885 --> 41:55.105
Yes.

41:55.666 --> 41:58.150
Is, again, for me, I can turn around and say, aha.

41:59.592 --> 42:03.078
But then, of course, you do have to allow yourself the freedom to imagine.

42:03.098 --> 42:06.503
Oh, I have to sometimes introduce, and that's what I mean.

42:06.543 --> 42:08.426
You can criticize me as a writer.

42:09.708 --> 42:14.676
But, you know, as I say, I always think truth is stranger than fiction.

42:14.842 --> 42:20.428
And the woman who is the model for this book, are you in contact with her?

42:20.448 --> 42:24.111
No, because, I mean, what's odd is by the end of it we hated each other.

42:24.932 --> 42:27.895
She was a very different model.

42:27.915 --> 42:30.798
She also put me in very dangerous situations.

42:30.818 --> 42:32.159
Really?

42:33.180 --> 42:35.583
She used to enjoy it.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.305
So she really is a bitch then, right?

42:38.466 --> 42:39.887
She's a wounded creature.

42:40.238 --> 42:42.582
But a dangerous wounded creature.

42:42.782 --> 42:48.671
She's dangerous, but she is now, I think, I mean, she does have a very good agency, investigating agency.

42:49.653 --> 42:52.317
She is doing very well.

42:53.979 --> 42:55.121
And she's clean.

42:55.522 --> 42:59.768
She hasn't gone back to drink.

43:00.970 --> 43:06.178
But the deal was that I never, ever said where she came from, what station she was

43:06.597 --> 43:09.602
But people must know who she is.

43:09.622 --> 43:12.147
It would be hard to find her.

43:13.389 --> 43:15.052
Very hard to find her.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.417
People in the PD must know who she is, no?

43:18.098 --> 43:19.921
Yeah.

43:20.482 --> 43:21.244
For what it's worth.

43:21.624 --> 43:23.067
Yeah.

43:24.329 --> 43:26.513
But they think she's lower than the

43:26.763 --> 43:28.586
But she came basically with money?

43:28.626 --> 43:29.487
Yes.

43:29.547 --> 43:31.850
The first time she came to me, she needed money badly.

43:32.111 --> 43:35.075
And there's no satisfaction in seeing the story?

43:35.656 --> 43:47.493
No, because, you know, you weave in her story, and then I have to weave out of it stuff that she can say can be directly linked to her, that she can be picked out.

43:48.575 --> 43:53.462
And she didn't like the fact that she felt I softened her.

43:55.366 --> 44:00.633
But, of course, the plot, the serial killer thing, that's totally invention.

44:00.653 --> 44:00.914
No.

44:01.795 --> 44:05.139
There was a serial killer, the hammer killer.

44:05.159 --> 44:08.223
He used the claw hammer in identically the same way.

44:08.464 --> 44:10.246
But not involved with her in any way.

44:10.867 --> 44:11.087
No.

44:11.147 --> 44:18.738
The murder that she actually witnessed that drew her back into police work was a random killing in the street.

44:19.639 --> 44:21.341
So she found that murder for me.

44:22.282 --> 44:22.723
I said, well...

44:22.855 --> 44:30.706
If you don't want me to put that because it identifies you and your location, bring me the murder that I can use in this.

44:31.527 --> 44:38.236
And so she brought me the prostitute that had been scarred on the back of her head.

44:39.258 --> 44:40.820
Well, I paid her for it.

44:42.142 --> 44:51.495
But what was so odd was that the day she called me up and she said, I think I've got the case for you.

44:51.982 --> 44:56.148
And we're in a cafe outside in Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive.

44:57.670 --> 45:01.175
And she's got this hookah with her that she's brought in.

45:01.215 --> 45:04.499
I mean, she was always bringing me expenses.

45:04.519 --> 45:06.482
You know, they came in from here, there and everywhere.

45:07.103 --> 45:07.904
Plane tickets.

45:07.984 --> 45:10.868
I mean, I don't know where she got half these expenses from.

45:10.888 --> 45:12.470
But anyway, she got this girl with her.

45:15.134 --> 45:18.258
I mean, she did not... I was weeping with laughter.

45:18.699 --> 45:19.660
She made me laugh too much.

45:20.568 --> 45:24.755
But she was the prostitute involved in the murder.

45:25.256 --> 45:29.523
And they got very loud.

45:30.424 --> 45:31.907
We're out on the pavement.

45:31.927 --> 45:36.514
And there's a little woman sitting within a foot of us.

45:36.534 --> 45:44.928
So they said, anyway, and the Lorraine says, go on, tell her, you've got to give all the details, because if you don't get the details, she keeps on coming back.

45:45.028 --> 45:47.192
Go on, tell her the details, tell her the details.

45:47.212 --> 45:47.352
See?

45:47.635 --> 45:50.678
As the girl's telling me the details, she keeps interrupting.

45:51.119 --> 45:53.261
She's given a blowjob, right?

45:53.341 --> 45:55.444
She's given the blowjob.

45:56.926 --> 45:59.929
And there's this woman on this table going, just look.

46:01.871 --> 46:07.157
So what Lorraine was saying was to position the girl.

46:07.598 --> 46:11.863
He's in the driving seat and she's in the passenger seat.

46:12.043 --> 46:14.065
So the head's going down to do the business.

46:15.074 --> 46:27.071
And then he clamped her with his right hand and then opened the glove compartment with his left, which meant that he was a left-handed, coming with the hammer with the left hand.

46:27.091 --> 46:28.253
Not necessarily, though.

46:28.273 --> 46:30.396
Oh, sure, if he had to go over with that hand, sure.

46:30.416 --> 46:31.858
Yes, you can't whack with that.

46:31.898 --> 46:38.007
So if he's got a head there, you've got to have a pretty good... And he went down with the hammer, twist it, and then pull the claw.

46:38.027 --> 46:41.211
So they virtually had their scalps ripped off.

46:42.353 --> 46:42.994
Jesus Christ.

46:43.014 --> 46:43.815
And...

46:45.415 --> 46:55.529
And so we had that serial killer, so I could not put just that serial killer, because then I could be sued by his family.

46:56.530 --> 47:06.263
I've now got to find yet another crime to lap on top of that, which was the second one she came up with was the high society family.

47:06.283 --> 47:08.526
You must keep some lawyers busy.

47:08.546 --> 47:10.549
I have one in permanent pay.

47:11.571 --> 47:12.672
In permanent pay.

47:12.888 --> 47:19.740
As they check through, they go, oh, my God.

47:20.221 --> 47:28.615
We had one chapter of my book that had to be read, line for line, and we got this guy up here threatening us with a mid-$15 million suit.

47:28.635 --> 47:29.457
It's a great story.

47:29.497 --> 47:31.921
I mean, this guy's a total fabrication.

47:31.961 --> 47:34.305
Anyway, I should send you a copy of my book.

47:34.994 --> 47:35.977
Oh, I'd love it.

47:36.097 --> 47:39.226
I think I've got plenty of stuff, and I've got a 10.30, so I'm going to... Okay.

47:39.407 --> 47:40.751
I wonder if you'd inscribe this for me.

47:41.072 --> 47:41.333
Yes.

47:41.894 --> 47:43.439
If you'd like, give me your P.O.

47:43.479 --> 47:43.840
box.
