WEBVTT

00:04.537 --> 00:05.719
We're two stars.

00:05.739 --> 00:11.246
Did you really intend to kill us, though?

00:12.027 --> 00:19.016
Well, I still intend to kill them.

00:19.176 --> 00:30.550
I mean, it's always been my desire to, you know, to get some kind of vengeance in time.

00:33.514 --> 00:34.155
But, you know,

00:35.620 --> 00:39.825
Some people kill me, some I'm not.

00:39.845 --> 00:48.596
You actually, I mean, as I read the book, you went in there with a piece, and this was going to be the moment.

00:50.197 --> 00:58.908
Yeah, I first got that, that, that gun in 1976, when I was still covering all the other crimes.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.750
I mean, it was always in the back of my head.

01:01.996 --> 01:02.617
I killed somebody.

01:02.637 --> 01:04.118
I didn't even know this guy was alive.

01:04.879 --> 01:14.350
But, you know, John and I kept in battle with this.

01:14.390 --> 01:16.573
You know, I used to hug him.

01:16.593 --> 01:21.919
Did you know John and he had this in the back of his mind?

01:22.059 --> 01:24.221
And you still say that you're not.

01:24.602 --> 01:26.704
This is a later question, but I wonder.

01:27.038 --> 01:32.606
with the completion of this book, if you feel, is there a great weight lifting from your shoulders?

01:33.147 --> 01:36.973
It's a clichÃ©, especially with a book like this.

01:37.013 --> 01:46.468
The people that write about us say the same thing, and I think you said the same thing in a letter to me, like, this is the book I became a writer to write, and we might even get into that.

01:47.790 --> 01:51.816
Having written this book that you became a writer to do, how do you feel about what the book looks like?

01:51.836 --> 01:55.341
I feel like stuff writing.

01:56.165 --> 02:00.011
I think my writing career should come to an end.

02:01.653 --> 02:13.771
But the... You know, the wound is still there, you know.

02:13.791 --> 02:14.913
It hasn't relieved that at all.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.676
I don't think anything ever can.

02:19.079 --> 02:22.965
It's like...

02:23.890 --> 02:28.737
I'm going to have to go back even to the little boy Nicola here.

02:30.480 --> 02:43.038
You went to BU in journalism school, and I don't know much about what you did in Worcester, but is this a fact that you actually intend to become a writer to do something like, to do a look at this?

02:43.098 --> 02:53.593
Oh yeah, the first time I decided to go into writing was when I was at Chandler Junior High School, and

02:53.995 --> 03:04.308
my English teacher, Marjorie Herd, who's Marjorie Rabide, who's retired now, but she was a wonderful teacher.

03:05.469 --> 03:13.659
And she got me to write something about my, you know, my years in Greece.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.885
And I wrote this for the school paper.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.710
And I wrote this thing, this piece, on a Saturday afternoon.

03:22.911 --> 03:23.952
And, uh,

03:24.961 --> 03:34.296
She printed it, and without telling me, she submitted it to an essay contest that was sponsored by the Freedom Foundation.

03:34.316 --> 03:35.638
And it won a prize.

03:38.984 --> 03:44.693
So at that time, I said to myself, now this is what I should do.

03:45.314 --> 03:47.538
This is year of 13 years now.

03:47.558 --> 03:48.319
Yeah.

03:48.552 --> 03:55.241
She told you specifically to write about, you wrote about your experiences in Greece?

03:55.301 --> 03:55.762
Yeah.

03:55.782 --> 03:57.624
This is just something that you decided to write about.

03:57.664 --> 04:15.488
No, she told me, you know, she said, I had gone to get my citizenship papers, and she said, you know, write something about the time in Greece, and I wrote it, and that really, and then I became editor of the junior high school paper, I became

04:15.805 --> 04:17.567
I went to classical high school.

04:17.627 --> 04:20.370
I became editor of the high school paper.

04:20.850 --> 04:22.272
And I went to Boston University.

04:22.292 --> 04:25.195
I became editor of the BU paper in my sophomore year.

04:26.256 --> 04:28.178
And then I went to Columbia Journalism School.

04:28.198 --> 04:36.728
So I knew from 14, from age 14.

04:36.788 --> 04:42.454
And I didn't realize until I was into this book that the reason I really focused on investigating

04:43.244 --> 04:52.797
investigator reporting was in part to... I was in training, you know.

04:52.957 --> 04:54.399
I've been training all my life.

04:55.040 --> 05:01.449
So this is, you know, to use an obvious metaphor, I mean, you were actually training for the big championship fight here.

05:01.689 --> 05:02.450
This was the big one.

05:02.490 --> 05:02.870
Yeah.

05:03.752 --> 05:05.274
It was the... Well, it's not a fight.

05:05.374 --> 05:11.462
It was... It was the... The thing, really, that...

05:13.838 --> 05:17.782
has shaped me as a person, these experiences.

05:17.802 --> 05:33.479
The way childhood shapes everybody, but since mine was a traumatic childhood, what is interesting is that it didn't, it made me stronger, it didn't make me weaker.

05:33.519 --> 05:36.021
What specifically made you stronger, the experience?

05:36.041 --> 05:41.567
The experience, because when I was, you know, very young, I was

05:43.792 --> 06:12.651
shy and I remember, you know, and sort of reserved and I remember my mother saying that she wished that one of my, my sister was a year older than me, that I had her gumption because I was, but rather than sort of being

06:13.863 --> 06:14.905
being crushed by this.

06:15.446 --> 06:38.402
I think it made me draw, find great reserves of inner strength and made me, basically I felt that my life wasn't my own, that I owed it to my mother.

06:39.715 --> 06:42.678
I ordered her to make something of it.

06:47.064 --> 06:49.767
Would you say you became obsessed with this, Nick?

06:49.867 --> 06:50.748
Not obsessed, no.

06:50.908 --> 06:52.069
I don't think obsessed.

06:52.090 --> 06:56.274
It's just that... One can almost feel it in here.

06:56.294 --> 07:09.570
Well, once I started working on that exclusively and became obsessed with it, but... It's like somebody who...

07:11.035 --> 07:25.889
you know who wants to you know who has you know wants to be something and works all his life for it.

07:26.389 --> 07:40.722
It was a something that I had to confront in my life at some point and I think I deliberately delayed it until I was in

07:41.140 --> 07:46.349
At my best, I think, you know.

07:46.369 --> 07:49.254
And emotionally, you know, strong.

07:49.354 --> 07:58.490
And also, like I said in the book, that the other times that I tried to do this, it was too painful for me.

07:58.590 --> 08:02.777
And it was after having my own children that I realized that

08:03.533 --> 08:14.266
you know, that my mother had, my mother's life wasn't all misery, that she had moments of happiness through her children.

08:14.507 --> 08:21.655
And that made me, that made it possible for me to go back and look at her life.

08:21.856 --> 08:23.818
And there are some age parallels here too.

08:23.838 --> 08:25.620
Yeah, I was exactly the same age.

08:25.761 --> 08:26.662
And your children.

08:26.722 --> 08:31.768
And my children were the same age as, my son was the same age as I was when I started.

08:33.892 --> 08:37.095
How clear are your memories of this period?

08:37.616 --> 08:48.506
I remember everything from the arrival of the Germans in our village in 1944 when I was, it was in April of 1944, I was not yet fired.

08:49.888 --> 08:52.771
I remember everything from that point on.

08:54.232 --> 08:54.452
Vividly.

08:54.532 --> 08:55.373
Vividly, you know.

08:55.954 --> 08:59.678
What people wore... Without being able to reconstruct the dialogue.

08:59.698 --> 09:02.160
Well, the dialogue...

09:02.343 --> 09:13.720
Sometimes not, but the experiences... What happened when I was present, I remember vividly.

09:13.740 --> 09:19.709
Of course, there was a lot that happened when I wasn't present, and that required tremendous reconstruction.

09:19.949 --> 09:24.756
And also, some aspects, other people had better memories than I did, you know.

09:25.478 --> 09:41.662
To my mind, there's only one thing that needs an explanation in this book, and that doesn't really need an explanation, but I'd like to put something in on it, is how you feel you are able to reconstruct the thoughts of people, particularly when your mother's walking off alone.

09:42.564 --> 09:45.989
Well, I said that in the... You quote Thucydides there, right?

09:46.009 --> 09:46.770
Yeah, quote Thucydides.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.532
No, no, I don't quote Thucydides on that.

09:49.654 --> 09:54.962
I quote Thucydides on reconstructing conversation.

09:55.398 --> 09:58.843
But the thoughts of people, basically, I did in two ways.

09:58.883 --> 10:05.713
One was through interviews of people who met my mother, for example, when she was walking around.

10:06.695 --> 10:13.384
I quoted one or two people who had run into her in between the periods when she was in prison.

10:14.606 --> 10:20.595
But she ran into, you know, a dozen people, and they told me what she said to them and so forth.

10:21.014 --> 10:30.747
A lot of that I just put as thoughts when there were emotions that my mother expressed to somebody, or other people expressed to somebody.

10:31.067 --> 10:46.768
In the final thing, there were some places where, of course, she was completely alone, and I just went up to... I went to...

10:47.137 --> 10:58.860
There was, sure.

10:59.180 --> 11:03.609
There was the Marianthi who escaped from the prison.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.112
They all went together.

11:05.294 --> 11:13.546
So I... And she told me how, you know, she talked about where every village they passed, where it could get here and, you know, and so forth.

11:13.907 --> 11:19.435
So actually it is... Actually, I can... If you were to go through all of it, I can tell you the source of all of it.

11:19.616 --> 11:22.841
So there actually is a source to... Everything.

11:23.121 --> 11:24.142
Everything.

11:24.163 --> 11:26.927
That's a very important point to make.

11:26.947 --> 11:27.047
Yeah.

11:27.968 --> 11:30.793
It may not appear, and the reader may say, gee, how did you get that?

11:30.913 --> 11:31.133
But...

11:31.568 --> 11:34.051
I can give you the name of the source, and I have the stuff.

11:34.091 --> 11:36.574
I have a closet full of notes.

11:36.715 --> 11:38.817
I mean, the notes I'll show to you later.

11:38.837 --> 11:45.286
Well, I think it's an important statement to make is that you are really not becoming too much of a novelist here.

11:45.326 --> 11:45.846
No, no, no.

11:45.866 --> 11:48.229
I mean, you're just using the techniques of the fiction writer.

11:48.770 --> 11:51.814
Often, often, the dialogue is verbatim.

11:51.894 --> 11:53.196
What she said, you wouldn't think that.

11:53.977 --> 11:58.402
But also makes sister to remember and describe what she said.

11:59.324 --> 12:00.445
And that some people...

12:02.804 --> 12:08.390
There's a woman in Salonika, for example, Angelky, who saw my mother.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.931
She's the one with the gold sovereigns.

12:09.971 --> 12:12.033
They called her in and asked her about the gold sovereigns.

12:12.954 --> 12:14.436
She has a fantastic memory.

12:14.696 --> 12:16.718
And I was just in Greece, and I saw her.

12:17.259 --> 12:22.264
And I told her that I met this British commando in London.

12:22.724 --> 12:23.665
And she said, oh, yeah.

12:23.685 --> 12:31.613
She said, you know, I remember she said he used to wear a little gold shoe on a chain.

12:31.998 --> 12:35.141
that his fiancÃ©e had given him.

12:35.162 --> 12:48.616
And when I went to London, I asked him, and he said, yes, you know, his fiancÃ©e was a nurse in Cairo, and just before he dropped into the village, he gave him this gold shoe.

12:49.197 --> 12:58.107
And I didn't describe it in the book, but... But...

12:59.453 --> 13:12.591
She, for example, has a fantastic memory where she can tell you what people wore, exactly what they said, how they looked, everything.

13:12.751 --> 13:16.397
There were two or three people like that.

13:16.737 --> 13:25.349
You found a lot of, if not resentment, but difficulty in talking to a lot of these people.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.954
Why would you think that was?

13:29.137 --> 13:31.841
Well, they all want to put in their past, you know.

13:33.464 --> 13:39.193
It was a period when most people showed their worst sides of themselves, and they want to forget it.

13:40.415 --> 13:43.300
They want to forget it, or they want to mythologize it, you know.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.226
I mean, particularly the leftists, you know, the communists.

13:47.466 --> 13:49.069
Well, you point this out, that...

13:49.201 --> 13:53.610
They've gotten rid of the day of mourning, apparently.

13:54.271 --> 13:54.532
Yeah.

13:54.552 --> 13:55.554
That's gone now.

13:55.574 --> 13:56.816
Everything is gone.

13:57.117 --> 13:59.422
There's no official holiday.

14:00.143 --> 14:00.504
Yeah?

14:00.784 --> 14:04.792
Good.

14:04.893 --> 14:11.125
Bravo.

14:12.742 --> 14:29.143
Have you ever been able to explain for yourself how it's possible that Greeks could be so beastly and unconscionably cruel to other Greeks?

14:29.323 --> 14:33.889
Well, you know, it happens with people.

14:34.358 --> 14:41.132
The same reason that Irishmen in Northern Ireland, they're all Irish and they can be beastly to each other.

14:41.392 --> 14:43.116
Ideologies separate people.

14:43.397 --> 14:53.818
When people adopt causes fanatically, and they put human life and human dignity above any cause, I don't care what it is.

14:54.338 --> 15:06.173
then it takes away the humanity completely and they can become that way.

15:06.193 --> 15:10.038
And I think it's the only explanation that I can see.

15:10.118 --> 15:15.305
Because ordinarily, you know, you meet these people under different circumstances.

15:15.385 --> 15:17.988
They're hospitable, generous, you know.

15:18.008 --> 15:19.570
They're a lawyer, for instance.

15:22.132 --> 15:24.476
A gentleman in college.

15:24.756 --> 15:26.218
Yeah, yeah.

15:28.222 --> 15:41.122
But, you know, he's not... You know, he... I mean, there were some of these people that were misfits, you know, who had these... He's a miserable person.

15:41.242 --> 15:50.316
I mean, his wife can't stand him, and it was clear from the conversation.

15:50.448 --> 15:52.436
people in this town don't like him.

15:52.456 --> 15:55.367
I mean, there are just some people who are just miserable people.

15:57.314 --> 16:00.205
He found an expression to legitimize

16:00.708 --> 16:04.976
all his hostilities, you know, that he must have gotten at some point in his life.

16:05.797 --> 16:24.049
Are there any kind of ghosts that you live with, I mean, on a daily basis, things, let me explain a little bit, I mean, things that bother you, that might have been, I mean, as I read this book, there are any number of, you use the image of doors closing, the final doors closing, doors closing.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.305
Why didn't we leave the village then when we could have?

16:28.365 --> 16:30.707
Why didn't my father bring us over when he could have?

16:32.129 --> 16:32.870
I do that.

16:33.170 --> 16:36.594
Of course, my father blames himself.

16:36.655 --> 16:38.837
Everybody blames themselves.

16:39.798 --> 16:48.889
I was too young to have been in a decision-making, to be in a decision-making role.

16:49.190 --> 16:55.700
I think I would have made as many mistakes as everyone else, so I don't blame them, you know.

16:56.100 --> 17:13.105
Arthur Gelborn said to me that day, he said, you know, you're hard on your father in this book, you know, and I said, not as hard as I am, as he is on himself, you know.

17:13.895 --> 17:21.307
He's much harder on himself, and I try to... Do you think you're harder than your father?

17:21.327 --> 17:21.667
No, I don't.

17:21.687 --> 17:22.188
You know, I do.

17:22.208 --> 17:26.275
It's a question I have.

17:26.295 --> 17:40.898
But you have to look at the context in which people made decisions, and I did learn one thing that held me in good stead from that period, and that is that

17:42.143 --> 18:10.480
get out of the get out of the line of fire you know if you can escape the bullet one you know if you uh and i was you know i've been in situation in iran for example when you know when they were shooting at a hotel where i was wearing i just went in the bathroom when there were no windows you know and one of my colleagues was killed there you know in other situations i um you know the if

18:10.679 --> 18:17.165
If anything haunts me, it's why I didn't kill the son of a bitch.

18:19.887 --> 18:23.931
You know, I still feel I should have killed him.

18:23.991 --> 18:26.433
I should have brought myself to kill him.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.294
At that moment, what is about you?

18:29.335 --> 18:40.585
Well, like I said, exactly what I said in the book, his daughter came in with his grandson, and...

18:40.784 --> 18:43.447
So either I had to kill everybody in the room.

18:43.487 --> 18:48.353
Now, there's another moment, though, when you let yourself in the room.

18:48.373 --> 18:50.976
Yeah, that was a much cooler moment, you see.

18:51.056 --> 18:52.137
I was not angry.

18:52.157 --> 18:53.419
I had not confronted him.

18:53.839 --> 18:59.987
And I saw him as an old man, and I suddenly said, you know, there's no satisfaction.

19:00.067 --> 19:03.771
I mean, the reason I made the decision, let's take it,

19:04.223 --> 19:05.064
Both decisions.

19:05.104 --> 19:07.287
The first decision... Because I understood that one.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.448
The whole family was there.

19:08.569 --> 19:11.132
You didn't want to kill innocent people who had nothing to do with the... Right.

19:12.073 --> 19:14.777
But also, you see, I didn't have to kill innocent people.

19:14.817 --> 19:17.460
I could have just killed him and waited there, you know.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.042
Yeah, but I liked your plan.

19:19.062 --> 19:20.404
Your plan was beautiful.

19:20.444 --> 19:22.166
Getting out.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.811
Of course, then you'd have confessed it in the book and they'd be extradited.

19:25.871 --> 19:29.315
No, you know, this is something that most people, they would not be extraditing me.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.737
I had researched it.

19:31.628 --> 19:35.293
A country cannot extradite its own citizens for any crime.

19:35.533 --> 19:42.782
America cannot extradite you if you're an American citizen to another country if you've committed a crime here.

19:43.102 --> 19:45.706
That was my one question.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.608
I said, well, let's say he did blow this guy away.

19:47.628 --> 19:47.909
Yeah.

19:47.929 --> 19:52.094
And he got out according to the plan, which I thought was beautiful.

19:52.875 --> 19:53.255
Yeah, yeah.

19:53.275 --> 19:57.441
No, there's no way they could have extradited him.

19:57.461 --> 19:57.601
Really?

19:57.621 --> 20:00.184
The...

20:01.649 --> 20:09.700
Um, you can only extradite people who are not, uh, under... For capital crimes?

20:09.740 --> 20:10.501
Yeah, oh yeah.

20:11.222 --> 20:20.375
What they could do, they could have done, they could try to come here and press charges here and have me tried here, but I'd never be convicted here.

20:20.395 --> 20:21.917
So I wasn't worried about that.

20:22.918 --> 20:24.060
Now that was the first time.

20:24.080 --> 20:28.686
The second, so I could have, I could have shot him and I would have been caught.

20:29.189 --> 20:33.698
And I would have gone to prison, you know, and I couldn't deny myself.

20:33.718 --> 20:45.460
I thought of my own children and I couldn't deny myself being separated from them, you know.

20:47.549 --> 20:51.114
It was very fast, but I knew it, you know, I just knew it.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.599
Because you didn't have the weapon at it, I don't think.

20:54.619 --> 20:58.664
You never got to the point of... No, I had my hand, I had it in the small of my back.

20:58.684 --> 21:00.647
This is in the first conversation.

21:00.667 --> 21:00.907
Yeah.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.252
But I mean when you went in, when you let yourself in.

21:04.312 --> 21:06.375
The second time, now we'll get to the second time.

21:06.415 --> 21:16.088
The second time, when I got in, I took out the gun, but I knew... I took it out, but...

21:16.422 --> 21:18.384
Two things kept me from there.

21:18.604 --> 21:22.868
One is I saw the guy, I mean... And he was a pathetic old man.

21:22.888 --> 21:40.945
Well, he was a pathetic old man, and he was... Old is the key word there, because shaving a few months or a few years off his life would not have been just payment for my mother's life, and would have changed the context.

21:41.085 --> 21:43.307
I mean, people would have...

21:43.996 --> 21:54.232
people would be debating, would be focusing on his killing of what I did to him rather than what he did to her and to all the others.

21:54.933 --> 22:11.438
So I didn't want him at the end of his life to escape the consequences of his acts.

22:11.823 --> 22:14.767
by just taking a few years off his life.

22:15.188 --> 22:16.249
That was very rational.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.290
It was a cool moment.

22:17.330 --> 22:21.616
The first time I was, I mean... Well, he angered you.

22:21.636 --> 22:23.559
Well, he angered me, but I went there angry.

22:23.579 --> 22:38.539
You see, I had been waiting for him in Athens, you know, and every day for him to call me, and it didn't come, and then there was a moment, there was only one day left, and I, you know, I flew there, I got in a car, I drove up, and by the time I got there,

22:38.992 --> 22:40.394
You didn't have to be provoked.

22:40.414 --> 23:00.545
I didn't have... Well, I needed to be provoked to do something irrational, like killing him and not worrying about, not thinking about the consequences, which... But he didn't do it, and I... He denied it throughout.

23:01.266 --> 23:04.611
He denied it, but I mean, he was the...

23:05.806 --> 23:07.769
It was sort of a feeble denial.

23:07.789 --> 23:12.876
I mean, everybody... I mean, there were 300 people at the trial, there's no... There's no doubt.

23:12.896 --> 23:30.563
There's no doubt, and there's no... He denied participating in trials of any civilians, and when you were a judge, a guerrilla judge, you participate in whatever trials they told you to participate in, and civilians are military, you know.

23:30.703 --> 23:35.610
So, he was just, like all of them now, they tried to, you know,

23:36.299 --> 23:44.652
We only shot in self-defense and we only executed prisoners after, you know, formal trials.

23:44.772 --> 23:59.015
But, you know, they were in the village near Sutsamanda, they found 121 bodies, you know, and in addition to the four officers in whose trial he presided.

24:00.016 --> 24:01.058
So,

24:03.417 --> 24:12.850
It, you know, the denial, not even his wife believed him, which is why she stopped him, you know, when he rose.

24:13.270 --> 24:14.512
Have you listened to the tape?

24:14.892 --> 24:17.536
You must have, I imagine you've listened to the tape many times.

24:18.938 --> 24:19.839
You mentioned the tape.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.882
Yeah, I do, I have the tape.

24:21.902 --> 24:26.208
And, I mean, because it's a verbatim discussion there.

24:26.228 --> 24:30.093
Yeah, the dialogue is word-to-word, and I have the tape.

24:30.113 --> 24:32.496
I taped a lot of these conversations.

24:32.729 --> 24:36.394
In fact, a lot of it where they knew it and a lot of it where they didn't know it.

24:36.414 --> 24:37.035
Yeah, that's right.

24:37.316 --> 24:41.341
I mean, because that, you know, in case any will never deny saying it, you know, or something.

24:41.842 --> 24:43.885
Do you think, will this be published in Greece, do you think?

24:43.905 --> 24:51.936
Or do you think the political climate will not be... Well, you know, I think it can be published in Greece.

24:54.380 --> 25:00.188
I haven't made any effort yet to publish it in Greece, because...

25:02.767 --> 25:26.038
I want to wait till it's published in the United States and in Europe and the full impact of the book is there so that they can't play games with it, you know.

25:26.219 --> 25:27.981
I'm not saying that this government is

25:28.467 --> 25:44.922
He's communist, but it wants to... I mean, the present Prime Minister, unlike his father, was not in Greece during that whole period, during the whole ten years, either World War II or the Civil War, and knows... He was here, right?

25:44.942 --> 25:46.684
He was here, and he knows nothing about it.

25:47.545 --> 25:56.753
And his wife told me that it's the thing that they fought most about with his father,

25:57.053 --> 26:01.239
because his father was a prime minister during this period for one time.

26:01.940 --> 26:14.738
And one of the conditions that the guerrillas had for going into negotiations is that his father be tried as a war criminal and executed, you know?

26:16.120 --> 26:24.732
So it's ironic now that he comes along and he plays this... I mean, I cannot...

26:25.302 --> 26:32.394
His message is that we have to forget about it and unite and so forth.

26:34.918 --> 26:52.086
I think the Greeks were on their way toward that, and by now pretending that that didn't happen or trying to rewrite history, it provokes those people who lost fathers and sons and brothers and mothers and daughters

26:52.640 --> 27:00.867
And so that there's a polarization in Greece, whereas if he had left it alone, time would have taken care of it, you know.

27:01.047 --> 27:05.391
What are your feelings about the character of Greece?

27:05.411 --> 27:06.832
Well, I know them, you know.

27:06.852 --> 27:08.554
Are there misgivings about where it's going?

27:09.295 --> 27:15.300
Well, you know, I have some misgivings about it, but I know Andreas.

27:15.340 --> 27:21.145
I think he's a sincere man, but I think that...

27:22.154 --> 27:40.801
I don't think he understands the, you know, the communist threat, because Greece, you see, is the only place that they lost, and it is stuck in their gullet, you know.

27:42.003 --> 27:50.355
I mean, I've traveled all over Eastern Europe and all over Western Europe, and the most fanatic and vengeful

27:53.002 --> 27:58.708
Marxist I've encountered are in Greece.

27:58.728 --> 28:08.138
And not even party leaders that I've met in communist countries as fanatic as Greek communist.

28:08.218 --> 28:11.722
And the reason for that is that they lost and they can't accept it.

28:12.222 --> 28:14.324
These obviously would be the older ones.

28:14.344 --> 28:15.405
The older ones, yeah.

28:15.425 --> 28:16.567
How about the younger ones?

28:17.107 --> 28:18.669
The younger ones have been sold a bill of goods.

28:18.709 --> 28:21.692
You know, the party has...

28:22.246 --> 28:34.298
has told him, has told them that these guerrillas were freedom fighters and fighting for Greece's independence

28:34.565 --> 28:36.988
suffering in the mountains and so forth.

28:37.048 --> 28:41.513
And they don't tell them what they did to the civilians and to the prisoners they captured.

28:41.833 --> 28:48.220
Well, you mentioned some of the younger kids, the students today, will come around and say, well, if they kill people, there must have been a good reason for that.

28:48.240 --> 28:48.600
Yeah, yeah.

28:48.620 --> 28:54.046
And they do not accept the contention that children were gathered up to gather... Yeah, they don't.

28:54.607 --> 28:59.592
How do you pronounce that word?

29:00.613 --> 29:02.175
It also leads people to

29:06.138 --> 29:14.270
To ask some hard questions, for example, I abhor the violence of the right in El Salvador, you know, and as any human being would.

29:15.151 --> 29:16.554
But that gets reported.

29:16.694 --> 29:25.587
I mean, I have not seen stories of what the guerrillas are doing in the villages that they've captured and controlled, you know.

29:25.607 --> 29:27.009
Because they're all reported there.

29:27.029 --> 29:31.015
Yeah, they're all sitting in hotels in El Salvador, you know.

29:32.362 --> 29:35.807
And, which is the way Greece was reported.

29:35.867 --> 29:43.417
If you read the reporting from that period at that time, you know, all the bad guys were in Athens and all... Really?

29:44.319 --> 29:45.200
Oh, yeah.

29:45.580 --> 29:49.766
It's exactly the way... The World of Fame was which way?

29:50.187 --> 29:50.387
Oh, yeah.

29:50.928 --> 29:53.952
It was... A lot of the sympathies were with guerrillas.

29:53.972 --> 29:54.392
Really?

29:54.412 --> 29:54.573
Sure.

29:54.753 --> 30:01.322
You read the reporting of many people like, you know, Homer Bigert and some very well-known reporters from that time.

30:01.994 --> 30:27.006
and they focused on the corruption and the abuses and the executions that the government carried out, which is right, but nobody went through and reported the thousands of people that were killed and every time a village was

30:27.779 --> 30:33.768
liberated by government troops, every few hundred feet you found a corpse, you know.

30:34.428 --> 30:36.571
There were no reporters that went with the troops.

30:36.592 --> 30:43.141
Well, you point out that on both sides, the concept of taking prisoners was not consistent.

30:43.581 --> 30:46.365
It was given all water and expected all water.

30:46.385 --> 30:50.531
Oh yeah, I have no sympathies.

30:50.591 --> 30:55.238
I interviewed one guy who was an irregular and he told me he killed all

30:55.842 --> 31:23.470
all prisoners that he took, you know, and, I mean, I despise him as much as I despise... I mean, and that's as bad as that is, but when it expands itself into the killing with the Samidians, that's... Well, killing anybody, I mean, it's just so... You know, I saw a picture in Time, I think it was not this week, but last week, and it showed...

31:25.070 --> 31:36.970
It showed a gorilla in El Salvador standing like this with the body of a dead government officer.

31:39.094 --> 31:49.592
And the disdain that you see in the eyes of the gorilla and the look of the gorilla for human life, it doesn't matter that it's the enemy.

31:50.703 --> 31:58.494
a human being's dead, I mean, I would be moved, tells me that I don't want to be ruled by that guy, you know.

31:58.715 --> 32:01.779
I don't want to be in a country where that guy has any power, you know.

32:02.640 --> 32:19.765
And so, you know, we tend to... I saw a very good play in London called Map of the World that sort of changes, you know, some of the...

32:20.977 --> 32:35.062
stand some of the liberal ideas upside down, you know, and essentially comes down on a humanistic liberal note, but raises some very interesting questions.

32:36.665 --> 32:38.749
There's a funny line in it where the guy says,

32:39.961 --> 32:43.566
You know, somebody mentioned Fidel Castro, you know, with great admiration.

32:44.107 --> 32:51.697
And this guy says, how can you take anyone seriously, he said, who was an extra in a Nesta Williams movie?

32:51.717 --> 32:53.159
I just heard that.

32:53.179 --> 32:56.723
I just heard that yesterday.

32:57.685 --> 33:00.348
That was a trivia question.

33:02.812 --> 33:06.316
If it seems like I'm not asking you a lot of questions about the book, it's because I read the book.

33:06.336 --> 33:07.017
That's all right, yeah.

33:07.037 --> 33:08.119
And I lose the book.

33:08.139 --> 33:09.040
Yeah, yeah, sure.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.538
It seems to me to ask questions to which I already know the answer.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.159
No, no, no.

33:13.179 --> 33:14.420
You ask whatever you want.

33:14.440 --> 33:22.168
We're just covering, I will be using the book, you know, obviously.

33:22.188 --> 33:23.489
How about the village itself?

33:23.509 --> 33:28.934
I mean, you must have ambivalent feelings about the village, and yet you go back there, you do good works there.

33:29.015 --> 33:35.741
One asks, I mean, I wonder if this subconsciously, are you trying to build a monument or something?

33:35.961 --> 33:36.442
I think so.

33:36.522 --> 33:37.643
I think basically that's

33:37.808 --> 33:43.837
You know, my mother was in a better position than most villages because my father was in the States.

33:44.498 --> 33:45.961
And was resented for it.

33:45.981 --> 33:47.002
Yeah, and was resented for it.

33:47.062 --> 33:50.087
But wherever she had, she shared, you know.

33:50.107 --> 33:55.355
And so I do things for the village, mainly because I like it.

33:55.375 --> 33:56.397
It's a beautiful area.

33:57.458 --> 34:00.143
And I want to survive.

34:01.445 --> 34:06.212
But more than that, I want people to know that

34:07.812 --> 34:16.963
You know, this is the son of Eleni Kadrianis, and this is what she was like.

34:18.625 --> 34:30.880
It's kind of a monument, but it's a way of carrying on what my mother represented in the village.

34:31.201 --> 34:34.545
Do you harbor any resentment to the people in the village?

34:35.268 --> 34:36.209
Yes, some of those people.

34:36.229 --> 34:37.812
Wondering, thinking, and criticizing.

34:37.832 --> 34:38.453
Oh, yeah.

34:38.473 --> 34:48.508
And then, you know, I... And people who are, you know, who testified against... There was one guy who had recently came back from Hungary, and I ran into him in the coffee house.

34:48.528 --> 34:50.070
He had testified against my aunt.

34:51.232 --> 34:56.300
And somebody said to me, do you know Uncle Foti?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.441
And I said, yes, I know him.

34:57.581 --> 34:58.643
I said, he's not.

34:58.623 --> 35:01.447
Well, the Greek word is kathiki.

35:01.728 --> 35:03.491
It's sort of the worst thing you can call it.

35:03.511 --> 35:07.337
It means chamber pot.

35:07.457 --> 35:25.305
He's a, you know, a, a, um, um, a trader and a, um,

35:26.011 --> 35:32.799
and, you know, and I call every name in the book.

35:32.899 --> 35:34.301
I know the word you're looking for.

35:34.321 --> 35:39.066
I mean, what's the person who points to the thing that I didn't condemn to the book?

35:39.086 --> 35:39.787
I know the word.

35:39.867 --> 35:40.448
Informant.

35:40.488 --> 35:42.490
Not an informant, but more its words.

35:42.510 --> 35:43.011
I know the word.

35:43.031 --> 35:43.351
I know the word.

35:43.431 --> 35:44.553
Stool pigeon.

35:44.573 --> 35:46.034
Not a stool pigeon.

35:47.136 --> 35:47.856
Informa.

35:47.876 --> 35:49.939
I know the word.

35:49.959 --> 35:54.364
Yeah, prodottis and... I'll come up with a fundamental way to... Yeah, yeah.

35:55.593 --> 36:01.321
How do you think that the people... And he said, what did he say?

36:01.561 --> 36:15.359
And I went right up to his nose, within about three inches from his eyes, and I said, I said you were an informant, an informer, a traitor, and a shit, you know.

36:16.060 --> 36:17.702
And I said, now do you hear me?

36:18.183 --> 36:22.589
And he had sons and brothers and cousins... Who were there.

36:22.609 --> 36:25.212
Who were there, you know, and they could have...

36:25.715 --> 36:32.062
defended him, but they saw the look in my eye and they just let it go.

36:32.262 --> 36:34.184
Do you think they knew what you were talking about?

36:34.204 --> 36:36.667
Oh yeah, they all knew, everybody in the village knows.

36:36.687 --> 36:38.228
And what do you think his motive was?

36:40.390 --> 36:45.396
You know, to impress the gorillas.

36:45.476 --> 36:51.402
This was a man, basically, you know, this was a man who was a little

36:51.803 --> 36:57.970
a little man who traveled around, was quite unsuccessful in life, his wife cuckolded him, you know, and all this stuff.

36:57.990 --> 37:05.117
And suddenly the guerrillas came along and gave him a minor position and he felt important and he wanted to please them by betraying people that he knew all his life.

37:07.280 --> 37:13.186
That, I think, is the most extraordinary thing to me, that people had a chance.

37:13.206 --> 37:15.408
I don't think that they could have saved you anyway.

37:15.428 --> 37:17.411
No, no, they couldn't.

37:17.851 --> 37:19.633
But as you know, you know, some of those

37:20.120 --> 37:25.490
What's good about it is that there were people who stood up and they said, this is wrong, you know.

37:25.510 --> 37:32.522
And I'm sure that for these people you have... And they were not, one of them was, you know, a communist and so forth.

37:32.603 --> 37:34.586
It doesn't matter to me, he was a human being.

37:34.967 --> 37:39.495
Well, one of the judges you point out tried to... Yeah, but he didn't have the guts to go through with it.

37:39.813 --> 37:43.438
Yeah, he died.

37:44.600 --> 37:53.012
I don't know how to put this question, but I'm sure you would have asked, but did you have to overcome any resentment for your father?

37:53.032 --> 37:56.437
Did you ever have any resentment for your father?

37:56.918 --> 37:59.461
Did you have to come to terms with this?

37:59.481 --> 38:02.125
I came to terms with my father a long time ago.

38:07.690 --> 38:34.356
You spell it out in the book, and I mean... My father was a, you know, any faults, any wrongs that my father committed were done because he's an innocent, you know, and he is a naive person, an innocent person, and Paul always believed, you know, had a positive view of life, and...

38:35.062 --> 38:37.646
made wrong judgments as a result.

38:37.746 --> 38:46.520
So, you know, I... And he was his own toughest critic, you know.

38:47.822 --> 38:57.217
So... But he was very... When we came here, you know, he raised us... You had never seen him?

38:57.237 --> 38:59.321
I'd never seen him till those nine years old.

38:59.481 --> 39:02.706
He raised us and he was very supportive and...

39:03.209 --> 39:08.798
He's a wonderful man, you know, and I mean, I love him dearly, and I always had a good relationship with him.

39:09.238 --> 39:25.543
At what point did it really strike you that your mother was, I mean, you're a young kid, it's hard for a child that age to really comprehend death and the fidelity of it, and I wonder, I mean, at what point did you really understand that your mother was dead?

39:25.563 --> 39:27.546
I mean, you wouldn't have been able to see her again.

39:33.567 --> 40:02.258
I don't think really... I mean, rationally understood it when we were leaving for the States and we came here and then my sister came and I knew that... See, one of my sisters stayed behind and she came back later.

40:02.913 --> 40:16.346
And as long as we were waiting for her to find out what happened to her, it hadn't really sunk in that my mother was dead because we were waiting for someone.

40:16.826 --> 40:26.575
When my sister finally came and we knew my mother was not coming, then it dawned on me.

40:26.616 --> 40:29.258
But I really never, I didn't quite

40:30.740 --> 40:37.710
accept it all until I was an adult, you know, and I went back to the village with my sisters and we had a memorial service, I talked about that in the book.

40:38.691 --> 40:47.163
And, you know, it was the, it was the first time I cried.

40:47.203 --> 40:52.791
Now I cry all the time.

40:52.911 --> 40:59.741
I reread that, page 299, I think it is again.

40:59.761 --> 41:00.021
299.

41:03.190 --> 41:19.968
I mean, just, uh, that, uh, page 2A, that last, I have your progress right now, and that's where I was reading it.

41:19.988 --> 41:20.088
Yeah.

41:20.108 --> 41:25.814
And I had it close with the book, you know, and I thought, wow, that's, uh, that's very heavy stuff.

41:25.834 --> 41:31.780
I imagine writing that was, was a tremendously, I mean, I feel,

41:32.249 --> 41:33.811
yourself on the page.

41:33.872 --> 41:35.013
Yeah.

41:35.033 --> 41:36.496
I don't know if I'm articulating it.

41:36.516 --> 41:41.203
Yeah, I... But was this a hard, difficult thing to write?

41:41.283 --> 41:48.915
I think we touched on that earlier, that you wanted to wait until you were really developed as a writer, as an investor in there, and everything else.

41:49.375 --> 41:58.189
But also, with the maturity of judgment that I imagine was necessary to put it into perspective.

41:58.456 --> 42:01.520
Do you still have that, that cross that she put around your neck?

42:01.780 --> 42:05.525
She knew it was the last time.

42:05.545 --> 42:08.169
Yeah, she knew, yeah, of course she knew.

42:08.269 --> 42:08.890
I don't have it.

42:09.390 --> 42:27.214
When we, we moved once from Greendell Avenue to Lincoln Street, it was about three years after we came here, and I had it packed in a shoebox with, you know, a lot of things that I valued, and

42:28.291 --> 42:34.940
The movie was somehow, you know, the shoebox never got to the new house and I never found it.

42:35.861 --> 42:41.369
I have one like it, which I can show you, but I don't have the particular cross.

42:41.929 --> 42:45.755
You kicked this off.

42:45.795 --> 42:47.497
Well, and it had another thing.

42:47.517 --> 42:56.509
It had a picture of me as a baby, the only picture of me as a baby, in which you see my mother's hand holding up my clothes

42:56.978 --> 43:03.307
showing my private parts to demonstrate to my father that I'm a boy because, you know, she'd had four daughters.

43:05.671 --> 43:07.534
That picture was in the same box.

43:08.295 --> 43:13.603
Some of the most... the things that I value most now were lost in it.

43:14.464 --> 43:15.445
That's funny.

43:15.465 --> 43:23.357
I mean, the documentation... Yes, yes, yes.

43:23.911 --> 43:32.259
How about being a trained newspaper man?

43:32.279 --> 43:44.510
I mean, your whole professional life has been to be objective, objective, to be... How about a story like this, which is, you know, your life, the torture, the murder of your mother.

43:44.530 --> 43:47.072
I mean, how does one handle that professional?

43:48.713 --> 43:53.698
Well, you know, I wasn't...

43:55.687 --> 44:22.257
being, you know, my objective here was to be accurate, not necessarily be objective, because the thing about writing is what Kazan told you, remember, you know, unless you expose yourself, you come out completely naked, you know, that it doesn't work.

44:22.417 --> 44:24.259
And the hardest thing for me

44:24.458 --> 44:29.525
having been trained as a reporter, was to look into myself and expose myself.

44:30.326 --> 44:38.716
And like I wrote in the book, for many times I could not bear to hear about my mother's torture.

44:38.817 --> 44:45.285
I mean, I could accept her being killed more than being tortured, you know.

44:46.947 --> 44:47.648
And I heard it

44:48.235 --> 44:50.117
you know, I would avoid the people who knew.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.039
When did you first learn that?

44:52.380 --> 44:53.341
Not here, I think.

44:53.681 --> 44:58.466
No, when I went back to Greece for the first time in 1963 when I finished college.

44:59.587 --> 45:00.889
And who told you about those people?

45:00.909 --> 45:07.015
Well, some of those people who had been there, you know, and they said she came down and feet were swollen.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.518
I couldn't bear to hear a thing, you know.

45:10.439 --> 45:15.745
And then later, but I knew where those people were and I kept track of them and I knew I would eventually someday have to go back.

45:17.412 --> 45:20.759
And I did it slowly, you know, where I would learn a little bit.

45:21.420 --> 45:28.875
And then finally, when I had the whole thing sketched out, I went back to them and got it all.

45:29.075 --> 45:33.143
And people...
