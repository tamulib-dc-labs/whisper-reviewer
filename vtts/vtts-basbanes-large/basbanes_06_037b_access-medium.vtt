00:03.389 --> 00:18.591
case at Harvard where they had a copy of a book, I can't recall the title, that was so perfect, it was so exquisite, an English book, that Jackson decided to sell it.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.176
And then they sold it.

00:22.716 --> 00:30.848
And he said, ironically, it has now made its way to Princeton through a collection which just came

00:31.216 --> 00:34.880
Jackson was called over here the Grand Inquisitor.

00:35.381 --> 00:53.342
But he said the reason that Jackson decided to sell it, and Nicholas actually thought this is defensible, is that because it is so perfect, it shouldn't be kept in a library where people would have access to it, and perhaps a private collector would keep it in its pristine shape.

00:53.623 --> 00:57.207
And I said, I'm amazed at it.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.427
It's on tape.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.428
I don't know how to find it.

01:01.448 --> 01:05.632
It's funny which one it was, because I remember there was one when I went to Princeton.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.874
Robert Taylor had a book.

01:08.695 --> 01:11.578
It was a marvelous copy of Henry Warren's Alex Sinterland.

01:11.598 --> 01:11.978
That's it.

01:12.118 --> 01:14.901
That's it.

01:15.061 --> 01:19.505
He said it went into the Bob Taylor collection to Princeton.

01:20.265 --> 01:22.868
And that's precisely the title.

01:22.888 --> 01:24.529
That's a cute story, isn't it?

01:25.030 --> 01:28.493
Henry Warren is one of my people.

01:28.658 --> 01:36.549
and I knew that, I wanted to handle that book, and Robert Taylor wouldn't, and he just wouldn't let me.

01:36.569 --> 01:37.951
But that's what happens.

01:37.971 --> 01:45.141
Yes, Harvard had it, and I can't imagine, why couldn't they just put some kind of quarantine on it?

01:45.161 --> 01:47.965
I don't know.

01:48.025 --> 01:58.480
But Nicholas points out, and it's true, the purpose of a repository, a university, of the British Library is to,

01:59.084 --> 02:03.852
Well, if you're lucky, of course, you might have a second copy.

02:03.872 --> 02:04.733
That would be wonderful.

02:04.794 --> 02:08.380
Now, I had an American visitor yesterday.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.829
He wanted to see a copy of Boswell's Life of Johnson's presentation of Boswell's Life of Johnson.

02:14.530 --> 02:24.687
Well, I was able to show him what I think is as perfect a copy of that book as is in existence.

02:25.409 --> 02:36.021
He acquired about five years ago a collection of a real magpie.

02:36.161 --> 02:43.470
He went on buying presentations of Bosworth Johnson until he got one, which was absolutely perfect.

02:43.590 --> 02:46.854
But if that were issued to readers, it wouldn't actually last.

02:47.995 --> 02:53.461
So you don't issue it to readers?

02:53.661 --> 02:54.302
No.

02:54.687 --> 02:57.531
probably three other copies of that particular book.

02:57.571 --> 02:58.652
This collector had four.

03:00.294 --> 03:04.340
Why does a collector want that many copies of the book?

03:04.360 --> 03:06.503
Or is it just the endless quest of the book?

03:06.523 --> 03:11.769
Well, I think in the case of this particular collector, he was actually in search of the perfect copy.

03:12.350 --> 03:14.313
Did he have perfect copies of other books?

03:14.573 --> 03:16.275
Or was it just the perfect copy of this book?

03:16.456 --> 03:21.302
I was thinking that that was one of the outstanding ones, yes.

03:21.721 --> 03:37.325
He had a marvellous collection of copies of Coach Duncey, which I think he... I can't remember again the story, but I think he kept in its original reference.

03:37.345 --> 03:42.072
And he sent it to the box, to the binder, and the binder promptly bound it.

03:42.152 --> 03:43.794
But it's still uncut.

03:44.596 --> 03:45.677
It's a lovely copy.

03:45.797 --> 03:47.560
And unfortunately it's been bound.

03:48.468 --> 04:08.937
I'm told that Lady Eccles has, I think, the annotated... Some people actually consider her the greatest living collector.

04:10.219 --> 04:18.390
Which I still know there are a number of American universities anxious.

04:18.742 --> 04:31.619
You walk in the Morgan Library, her name is prominent.

04:32.701 --> 04:33.682
She's really marvelous.

04:33.862 --> 04:37.948
I met her at the Grosier.

04:38.435 --> 04:43.003
I've interviewed Bill Scheide by the way.

04:43.204 --> 04:48.854
That's kind of a coup for me because he hasn't given any interviews.

04:49.214 --> 04:52.380
He is the example.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.163
I will write this chapter.

04:54.724 --> 04:59.473
I spent four hours with him on a Friday evening in the Princeton Library.

05:01.396 --> 05:02.518
He started with his

05:02.752 --> 05:06.156
his 42-line Bible, as he called it, and I didn't know what he was getting.

05:06.196 --> 05:08.078
It was just a box.

05:08.098 --> 05:14.605
I put it down on my lap, and he went back.

05:14.625 --> 05:15.385
I was dizzy.

05:15.686 --> 05:19.550
It isn't often one holds it for a Bible.

05:20.811 --> 05:23.914
He's got a 1457 Psalter, which we haven't.

05:23.934 --> 05:26.637
He's got something that you took out.

05:27.839 --> 05:32.083
He said, he's the only Anglo-Saxon book in North America.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.396
The Lickling Homilies.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.822
It is the best hang of Saxonbrook in North America.

05:38.842 --> 05:44.349
It isn't strictly speaking, I think, the only... They've got the Willow Edgifull, hasn't it?

05:44.970 --> 05:45.050
Yes.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.993
Which is another very good hang of Saxonbrook.

05:47.413 --> 05:51.639
I think they're one too strong.

05:51.659 --> 05:55.464
But the Lickling Homilies.

05:55.605 --> 06:01.092
Well, I'd have to look at Neil Kerr's catalogue of

06:01.595 --> 06:03.437
I have a Saxon manuscript.

06:03.858 --> 06:09.644
I think the Blickling homilies are basically the best Anglo-Saxon book in there, but they're only two scraps.

06:10.425 --> 06:11.627
Well, that was a close celeb.

06:11.927 --> 06:12.167
Yeah.

06:12.207 --> 06:13.749
When it left.

06:13.829 --> 06:15.030
The circumstances end up.

06:15.851 --> 06:17.553
I don't know the circumstances.

06:17.573 --> 06:21.438
Well, I know Ed Wolff writes about it in his Rosenbach book.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.440
Yes, well, that's a great book.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.222
I've interviewed Ed, by the way.

06:25.342 --> 06:27.124
Yeah, at least, yes, at least.

06:27.305 --> 06:30.268
I've really talked to quite a number of people.

06:31.210 --> 06:36.278
Well, we will contrast, not in the same chapter, of course, but it will happen in the book.

06:37.880 --> 06:53.525
You come to a place like this, or you go to Cambridge, and you go to the Holy Library, and you go to the Bible, and you go to the Bible, and then I go to Texas, I spent four days in Texas, which is a fascinating story.

06:53.545 --> 06:59.614
I've never been to Texas, I know the others, but the story of the formation of the collections there.

07:00.202 --> 07:04.308
in a 15-year period, of course, focusing on the 20th century.

07:04.328 --> 07:07.473
Well, of course, they were able to move backwards in time.

07:07.653 --> 07:10.397
They bought a lot of those, didn't they?

07:10.457 --> 07:12.280
They basically got that collection.

07:12.781 --> 07:15.585
That was when Decker Turner was there.

07:15.605 --> 07:18.269
Decker changed things, changed the focus for a while.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.794
But it's an interesting story.

07:22.575 --> 07:26.221
Quintessentially Texan, I think.

07:26.922 --> 07:27.002
Yes.

07:27.438 --> 07:31.504
Well, what was the perception over here when Texas was buying up all this stuff?

07:31.564 --> 07:41.318
Well, I wasn't working in this library, then I was working at the British Museum, then.

07:44.362 --> 07:45.444
Well, we just couldn't get in it.

07:46.706 --> 07:48.628
I think... You couldn't get what I'm saying?

07:48.668 --> 07:50.892
Well, we couldn't get near the material they were buying.

07:51.052 --> 07:51.893
Even though you wanted it.

07:52.379 --> 07:54.102
You'd like to have had some of it?

07:54.142 --> 08:04.918
The British Museum in those days was a bit odd, because they didn't, and they weren't actually very interested in modern literary manuscripts, which is really what Texas would find.

08:05.278 --> 08:09.805
That did demonstrate a bit, of course, a perception of that in their prime, wouldn't you think?

08:09.865 --> 08:17.356
Yes, I think they probably, as we've said, went over the top a bit, because they must have quite a lot of junk there.

08:17.376 --> 08:20.040
But on the other hand, they've got some very good things as well.

08:20.425 --> 08:23.490
Roger Kennedy at the Smithsonian, I don't know if you know Roger.

08:23.850 --> 08:28.557
He has the Smithsonian Museum of the American History.

08:28.577 --> 08:30.580
Not a book collection, but he's an interesting man.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.044
He collects things.

08:33.244 --> 08:34.667
Things in the literal sense.

08:35.628 --> 08:37.231
And we were talking about Texas.

08:37.311 --> 08:41.237
And he said, you know, yeah, I'll bet there's a lot of junk there.

08:42.238 --> 08:47.386
He said, but sometimes the junk is very important.

08:47.506 --> 08:48.087
Yeah.

08:48.337 --> 08:50.820
Well, there's a lot of junk here, too.

08:50.880 --> 08:58.028
He said, to fully understand the masterpiece, it's really very useful sometimes to look at the junk.

08:58.548 --> 09:00.150
That's true, yes.

09:01.471 --> 09:08.679
In a collection like ours, which has been growing up over centuries, in some ways, there's very little discrimination about what came in.

09:09.961 --> 09:15.627
You see, if you go to the great American collections, they're probably, in some respects, better than ours for named authors.

09:16.062 --> 09:23.130
Yale's probably got better collections of some 18th century authors than we have.

09:23.150 --> 09:29.697
They've got all the books that the authors wrote, but they haven't got all the books that the authors read.

09:29.717 --> 09:31.119
And they're here?

09:31.199 --> 09:38.948
Well, we've got massive pamphlet collections.

09:38.968 --> 09:44.314
They're not individually important, but they are important as a collection.

09:44.581 --> 09:49.751
As Marcus was saying about the Tamerlane, we don't have a pose.

09:50.632 --> 09:55.221
If any institution in the United States should have a pose, Tamerlane should be.

09:55.261 --> 09:55.842
It belongs.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.666
One belongs in the word antiquarius.

09:57.766 --> 10:00.832
We've got a Bayson book.

10:00.892 --> 10:01.814
Bayson is nice.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.296
Well, they have a Bayson.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.699
That came in with Isaiah Thomas.

10:05.388 --> 10:11.017
That's wonderful.

10:11.437 --> 10:15.163
You get these things almost contemporary with hair.

10:15.223 --> 10:18.028
That's kind of close.

10:18.108 --> 10:21.593
But to go back to the Don Quixote, just briefly, you did buy it when it was issued.

10:21.693 --> 10:24.758
Our agent bought it, yes.

10:24.818 --> 10:28.003
This is on record, you had an agent in Spain.

10:28.444 --> 10:32.610
Our bookseller went to Spain.

10:33.637 --> 10:42.408
And he was not treated terribly well there, because there's a great deal of enmity on both political and religious grounds between England and Spain.

10:42.788 --> 10:47.214
We're talking about a time not long after a great war between the two nations.

10:47.234 --> 10:50.818
Well, I think that we were actually at peace at the time.

10:51.879 --> 11:00.690
Well, I mean, it's a hundred years since the American Civil War, and it's just now the North and the South are just starting to get along, you know.

11:01.025 --> 11:01.926
So what happened?

11:01.946 --> 11:02.827
The agent went there?

11:02.847 --> 11:03.708
He went there.

11:03.948 --> 11:08.394
He bought quite a lot of Spanish books.

11:08.714 --> 11:11.717
So he didn't really go there to buy Don Quixote?

11:11.818 --> 11:14.280
No, he went there to buy Spanish books.

11:14.300 --> 11:14.581
St.

11:14.881 --> 11:25.433
Thomas Bodley was actually using the agent to go to the continent to buy continental books because that's much more important.

11:25.674 --> 11:29.378
The continental booksellers and printers are much more important.

11:29.948 --> 11:33.213
for a learned library, they're English books.

11:33.233 --> 11:34.515
So you have to buy books abroad.

11:35.316 --> 11:39.583
Are there any other examples of great books that you think were bought?

11:40.123 --> 11:45.772
Well, that's probably the most famous in South Africa, when they came out abroad.

11:46.593 --> 11:48.696
What's the condition of your copy?

11:48.977 --> 11:50.419
It's well used.

11:50.679 --> 11:55.146
It's actually been rebound.

11:56.628 --> 12:02.815
that the librarian would have taken off the shelves to show to his important visitors.

12:02.835 --> 12:07.600
And the result, of course, is that issues had to be rebound.

12:09.962 --> 12:11.444
Can you dazzle me with numbers?

12:11.504 --> 12:15.748
Can you tell me, give me a rough idea of what you've rolled here?

12:15.769 --> 12:22.496
Well, we can probably get, we say we've got over five million volumes.

12:22.516 --> 12:24.518
But these are, well, are they manuscripts?

12:24.538 --> 12:26.500
I don't know what, how we get from the manuscripts.

12:27.340 --> 12:36.894
We would say in almost every respect we've got the largest collections in Britain except for the British Library.

12:36.914 --> 12:42.582
If you go to Cambridge, they'll say they've got more taxons than we've got.

12:42.903 --> 12:43.744
We get that out of here.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.268
They have got more taxons than we've got.

12:47.169 --> 12:55.862
But I bet we've got about six or seven thousand in the library, which makes this one of the largest collections in the world.

12:56.939 --> 13:05.229
And we've got the largest collection of early English books after the British Library.

13:05.249 --> 13:18.865
I think we recommend that our collections of the restoration drama are probably the highest in the world.

13:18.885 --> 13:22.609
English 18th century books, we have again after the British Library, the largest books.

13:23.568 --> 13:26.031
Generally speaking, it is English material.

13:26.892 --> 13:28.774
Yes.

13:28.794 --> 13:33.479
But the continental collections are extremely good.

13:33.499 --> 13:37.663
And of course, not only in the Bodden Library itself, but in Oxford at large.

13:38.124 --> 13:41.868
Of course, all colleges got collections of value books as well.

13:41.888 --> 13:45.492
How many individual libraries would you say there are in Oxford?

13:45.512 --> 13:47.434
I know Harvard has 95 of them.

13:47.514 --> 13:49.456
I think we've probably got more.

13:49.756 --> 13:53.440
You see, we've got, there are

13:53.605 --> 13:55.328
35 or 36 colleges.

13:55.448 --> 13:57.271
Every single college has got a library.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.774
Some of them are huge.

13:59.815 --> 14:05.323
There are not as many books in Oxford as there are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

14:05.343 --> 14:07.226
That's true.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.950
But important books.

14:10.811 --> 14:14.517
I'm sure there are.

14:15.357 --> 14:24.768
We haven't had the resources that Harlow had in great days in the face of Jackson and so on, and simply haven't been able to deploy that kind of research.

14:24.788 --> 14:25.789
But it's still very good.

14:26.269 --> 14:28.912
Roger now moans that he doesn't have any money.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.096
He says, Yale has all the money.

14:32.116 --> 14:34.659
He said, we don't have a financial system.

14:34.679 --> 14:34.739
No.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.042
Well, we've done these a bit well.

14:38.663 --> 14:42.968
When you came in as a librarian at the institution to a party,

14:43.707 --> 14:50.136
This is great.

14:50.276 --> 14:59.289
I'm so glad I came.

15:00.511 --> 15:01.853
What is your formal title, sir?

15:02.333 --> 15:04.036
It's a long one.

15:04.076 --> 15:06.559
I'm a deputy librarian.

15:06.579 --> 15:08.382
I'm for how many people of these books.

15:08.564 --> 15:10.166
Deputy Librarian and?

15:10.226 --> 15:12.249
Paul Hamlin, Keeper of Prince Books.

15:12.549 --> 15:14.572
Paul H-A-M-L-Y-Hemlin.

15:16.534 --> 15:17.836
And Paul Hamlin must be?

15:18.697 --> 15:22.102
And he's a very eminent publisher.

15:23.724 --> 15:35.379
Will there be any kind of booklets or things?

15:35.459 --> 15:36.681
Oh, yes.

15:37.623 --> 15:48.973
So you're celebrating the acquisition of the Tenbury collection.

15:49.313 --> 16:00.463
And this was something that was given or something that we purchased?

16:00.643 --> 16:06.448
College for teaching church music.

16:07.306 --> 16:20.077
It closed down in the 1980s, and it had the finest collection of manuscripts and books after the British Library in the country.

16:20.097 --> 16:24.661
And it had some sort of title to the books.

16:24.781 --> 16:31.727
It said, if the school closes down, I want my music library to get to the bottom.

16:31.747 --> 16:33.509
And this was a hundred years ago.

16:33.529 --> 16:34.890
The man had foresight, didn't he?

16:34.990 --> 16:35.711
He did, yes.

16:35.731 --> 16:37.212
That's wonderful.

16:37.681 --> 16:50.103
So what happened was that they came to a compromise with the trustees of the college, by which they gave us the manuscripts.

16:50.123 --> 16:54.651
And the manuscripts are top manuscripts.

16:54.671 --> 16:56.454
It gives the conducting score appendages aside.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.159
Now, it's not the manuscripts, it's the conducting score.

16:59.179 --> 17:01.343
And that's the other very important manuscript, and it's not the actual appendages.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.362
So you did get the printed books?

17:03.483 --> 17:08.089
We had to pay for the printed books to raise the money.

17:08.390 --> 17:16.601
What we did was having a book section to take our benefit.

17:16.621 --> 17:26.335
I imagine this is one that has, and again I'm not meaning to compare you to Texas because there is no comparison,

17:27.783 --> 17:34.929
When you go back and you say, well, we thought maybe they went over the top instead of spending all their oil money on anything that came their way.

17:36.230 --> 17:44.758
I think one of Harry Ransom's quotes at the time was, well, we are at Oxford and we are at Harvard and stuff doesn't just come our way.

17:44.878 --> 17:46.019
We have to do it.

17:46.079 --> 17:47.380
We have to do it to get it.

17:47.921 --> 17:48.201
Yes.

17:49.983 --> 17:51.864
That's a roundabout way of asking a question.

17:51.924 --> 17:56.068
Are you in a luxurious kind of position where, because you are at Oxford,

17:56.453 --> 18:02.382
that wonderful things will tend to get away.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.207
It does happen.

18:07.188 --> 18:23.592
Being Oxford is not... there is one drawback to being Oxford and that is that people tend to... the alumni tend to think of themselves as members of their colleges rather than of the university.

18:23.612 --> 18:25.735
So a lot of the money goes back to their colleges

18:26.575 --> 18:33.403
There are tight, very close corporations.

18:33.603 --> 18:34.705
The colleges are?

18:35.085 --> 18:35.305
Yes.

18:36.347 --> 18:40.271
So they are too eager to spring some of this money loose for?

18:40.291 --> 18:43.095
Well, it's very up to mothers of college next door, Trinity.

18:43.115 --> 18:49.703
They've got a marvellous collection of plate books, which is given to them by one of their former members.

18:49.723 --> 18:53.427
They often get their former members giving their papers and their books.

18:53.963 --> 18:57.589
to their colleges rather than to the university library.

18:57.669 --> 19:03.197
And people's loyalties are primarily to the college, rather than to the university.

19:03.297 --> 19:05.301
But is there anything wrong with that?

19:05.421 --> 19:08.686
There's still a lot of years.

19:08.726 --> 19:21.085
You see, if people will leave collections of books to Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, and whatever, because they are a class of 1940s by Princeton, Cornell, and so forth,

19:21.790 --> 19:24.113
They don't think of Oxford in quite that way.

19:24.133 --> 19:27.938
They think that I was up at Morton from 1947 to 1950.

19:29.279 --> 19:31.802
That's the way the Oxford graduate thinks.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.345
He doesn't think I was at Oxford then.

19:34.365 --> 19:38.470
He thinks I was up at Morton or Queens.

19:38.490 --> 19:43.376
The colleges, they do tend to have first pen on people's benevolence.

19:44.398 --> 19:47.882
In terms of money as well as artifacts?

19:48.858 --> 19:56.047
But I can see in terms of the money that the university would really like to have the money so it could use it at its discretion.

19:56.848 --> 20:00.573
But it's probably not so bad if the books go to one of the colleges.

20:00.593 --> 20:02.756
You know, you might like to have them here.

20:02.876 --> 20:04.759
I mean, they're still on campus.

20:04.939 --> 20:06.641
Yes, in general, we wouldn't.

20:06.661 --> 20:15.633
If there are extremely rare and valuable books that are in colleges, we wouldn't duplicate them, because in general, colleges don't dispense of these things.

20:15.653 --> 20:17.295
In general, they don't.

20:18.406 --> 20:22.632
You said Duke Humphrey was the first book collector?

20:22.652 --> 20:28.201
Well, he's the first major book collector, you can call it a known gift, who had given us specific books.

20:28.822 --> 20:32.086
There were earlier benefactors to the university.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.949
So he's somebody I should know about.

20:33.969 --> 20:37.054
You should know about Duke Humphrey, yes.

20:37.074 --> 20:39.818
Somebody, by the way, when I'm pressing with the time.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.924
I'll just give you a quick story from that.

20:43.944 --> 20:44.565
I'd like to ask.

20:44.748 --> 21:14.502
I understand that you are, this is the nerve center, Mr. Robbins was just telling me, and that you actually are involved in the buying or the acquisition, shall we say, of new items for the collection.

21:14.768 --> 21:18.092
These are all recent collections in that we're looking at?

21:18.433 --> 21:19.634
No, they go back a few years.

21:21.937 --> 21:27.884
Collectively, in the last five or six years.

21:27.904 --> 21:31.248
This is the material that remains uncataloged around.

21:31.268 --> 21:33.691
So they await cataloging.

21:33.711 --> 21:36.295
Cataloging, and then they'll enter the general collection.

21:36.955 --> 21:39.138
What if a scholar needed one of these volumes?

21:41.221 --> 21:44.725
Well, if he knew we had it, which is unlikely,

21:44.992 --> 21:48.516
We could find it for him.

21:48.656 --> 21:49.156
No problem.

21:49.617 --> 21:51.319
Are there specific things you're looking for?

21:51.739 --> 21:57.285
Are we really aware of targets of opportunity, so to speak?

21:58.426 --> 22:04.252
Well, we try to build on the strengths of the library's existing collections.

22:04.272 --> 22:11.179
So English literature, history, theology, mainly art subjects.

22:11.980 --> 22:14.863
We don't have much expertise in this section in scientific.

22:17.813 --> 22:19.575
and gaps.

22:20.936 --> 22:22.698
That's always important, isn't it?

22:22.879 --> 22:30.247
Could you spell your Christian name and surname for me, just so I can define it?

22:30.507 --> 22:31.288
Uh-huh.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.469
In your position.

22:39.097 --> 22:41.439
Do you go through dealer's catalogs?

22:41.459 --> 22:41.760
Yes.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.922
That's how you measure it.

22:46.197 --> 22:54.424
every day they come in, and the clerk in the room will put them out into this tray and date them.

22:54.444 --> 22:56.186
It looks like a mag's catalog down there.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.609
This one here, or did I just get this one?

22:59.629 --> 23:02.051
No, it's gone up in the air.

23:02.071 --> 23:03.913
Corritch, fine.

23:03.933 --> 23:04.914
You've got the clerk?

23:05.434 --> 23:05.694
Yes.

23:06.795 --> 23:13.101
Oh, it's fine in a way.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.742
That's the other one.

23:14.762 --> 23:15.343
Yeah, okay.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.402
Yes.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.545
This is exciting.

23:20.026 --> 23:21.448
Yeah, it's a very nice children's book.

23:21.488 --> 23:22.730
You've heard about the AP.

23:22.810 --> 23:23.411
Indeed.

23:23.451 --> 23:24.772
We've discussed it.

23:24.792 --> 23:24.933
Yes.

23:24.953 --> 23:30.400
Well, we've got some monies now from the overflow to the AP.

23:30.420 --> 23:30.881
Wonderful.

23:31.482 --> 23:35.027
And we're spending them on high-spot children's books.

23:35.087 --> 23:37.270
And one came up in a crutch cover yesterday.

23:38.131 --> 23:40.775
That was?

23:40.795 --> 23:42.377
I've known it as 1700.

23:42.712 --> 23:46.637
A poem for children written by a Queen's college man.

23:47.138 --> 23:51.184
It's called Good Manners for Schools.

23:51.204 --> 23:53.327
Dykes, Oswald, D-Y-K-E-S.

23:54.548 --> 24:00.336
That was the one I was telling you about.

24:00.396 --> 24:04.242
I have this catalogue, that's why I was acquired yesterday.

24:05.483 --> 24:08.007
You can get some idea of what kind of thing you go for.

24:08.508 --> 24:09.309
That's great.

24:09.329 --> 24:11.672
There are two and a half books for...

24:11.905 --> 24:33.711
I am particularly keen on getting early English novels which we didn't pick up at the time because they weren't considered important and of course they weren't serious material for a university library and so we do have serious gaps and so it's always

24:34.265 --> 24:57.150
would you say what you have and those areas were came to you largely from private collectors and now you're filling in um well from private collectors but also uh later editions which we have acquired since um and they've since decided they're worth having in the first state yes

25:01.838 --> 25:02.178
Wow.

25:02.579 --> 25:06.542
You got Don Quixote, but you didn't get a chance.

25:06.562 --> 25:09.565
Well, that's fine.

25:09.885 --> 25:12.528
Is that an oversight, do you think, or that was just politics?

25:12.548 --> 25:24.819
I think what I was telling you was that they are the accounts who dominated the university and the library were interested in what they were teaching.

25:24.839 --> 25:25.659
They were not teaching English.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.541
Well, they teach in Spanish, which come to that.

25:28.081 --> 25:29.803
Oh, well, long quick, this is a bit of a...

25:30.087 --> 25:37.233
It's wonderful, though.

25:37.253 --> 25:44.019
But the story of how it came to the university as it was issued, I think, is just wonderful.

25:44.059 --> 25:54.789
Now, for instance, I don't mean to be indelicate on this, but do you negotiate with Qualich on the price, or do you pretty much pay catalog price?

25:54.849 --> 25:59.233
That's important.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.226
And do you kind of have to run it to a committee, or do you have discretion?

26:03.266 --> 26:07.052
It depends how expensive it is.

26:07.072 --> 26:12.100
Something that's going to be over 5,000 pounds, I have to ask the librarian.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.101
We discuss it.

26:13.823 --> 26:15.185
Makes sense.

26:15.205 --> 26:15.705
That's great.

26:16.146 --> 26:19.872
And I think, do we say over 1,000 by discussing it with you?

26:20.273 --> 26:24.897
We're going to move along.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.640
I'd like to be in touch with you again, if that's okay.

26:27.660 --> 26:33.244
I hope to be coming back August, September to do a little more work.

26:33.965 --> 26:37.288
I'm all out of mine, but I will take one of yours.

26:37.308 --> 26:37.688
Great.

26:37.789 --> 26:41.992
There's the house from Shakespeare that I was telling you about.

26:42.012 --> 26:46.216
No, we're looking at, these are perhaps four inches by two and a half inches.

26:48.078 --> 26:48.758
Yes.

26:49.159 --> 26:49.639
Look at them.

26:50.176 --> 26:50.616
Can you see these?

26:52.078 --> 26:53.079
It's how our collections grow.

26:53.119 --> 26:54.521
These came as a gift.

26:54.541 --> 26:54.841
1808.

26:55.602 --> 27:00.808
If they had been an acquisition in a college catalog, it would probably be several thousand pounds each.

27:01.468 --> 27:03.891
Well, we didn't actually know these existed.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.793
They were as rare as that.

27:06.033 --> 27:08.256
You didn't know they existed as publications?

27:09.017 --> 27:10.218
We didn't know they existed.

27:10.238 --> 27:13.922
Can we describe them in some detail while I have my machine running, or just what they are?

27:14.903 --> 27:19.508
Well, they are the first separate publications of LEMS,

27:19.825 --> 27:20.847
Tales from Shakespeare.

27:21.227 --> 27:23.411
And they're in paper, though, which is amazing.

27:23.431 --> 27:24.793
And I see the dates, 1807.

27:24.873 --> 27:26.155
This is Winter's Tale.

27:26.636 --> 27:31.383
They have, I would imagine, hand-colored copper plates.

27:31.924 --> 27:34.708
And published by Godlin.

27:35.169 --> 27:38.794
And you say that these would probably go for several thousand pounds each.

27:39.596 --> 27:46.947
And they came in... As a very generous benefaction from a man who...

27:47.078 --> 27:48.960
had heard we'd got the OP collection.

27:49.020 --> 27:49.520
Wonderful.

27:49.680 --> 27:54.625
And he had some family books in his, some children's books, which had been handed down to his family.

27:56.127 --> 28:00.711
He's a Barrett Browning, a little bit of that.

28:01.932 --> 28:03.233
Is he someone you can identify?

28:03.293 --> 28:06.356
Or do we prefer that he remain anonymous?

28:06.416 --> 28:08.418
Oh, no, I don't think so.

28:09.239 --> 28:11.561
Mr. Edward R. Moulton Barrett.

28:11.862 --> 28:14.164
M-O-U-L-T-O-N-B-A-R-R-E-B-E.

28:14.204 --> 28:14.864
That's a hyphen.

28:15.105 --> 28:15.465
Yes.

28:16.272 --> 28:23.663
And some of the books are inscribed by... Is this a copy of something?

28:24.243 --> 28:28.289
That is something he wrote to tell us about the families.

28:28.369 --> 28:31.133
Okay, that's not something I could have a copy of.

28:31.153 --> 28:33.156
Oh yes, if you'd like one, I'd like that.

28:33.176 --> 28:35.159
Do you mind, sir?

28:35.179 --> 28:37.943
I don't think he would have...

28:38.935 --> 28:40.638
It's the kind of thing I'm writing about.

28:40.818 --> 28:47.910
It's how a collection is energized by another collection.

28:48.631 --> 28:50.855
This just seems to be the excellent illustration.

28:50.875 --> 29:05.078
How successful was the appeal?

29:05.412 --> 29:10.159
Is it a publicly-disclosable figure?

29:10.800 --> 29:16.728
Really?

29:16.949 --> 29:35.115
That is extraordinary, isn't it?

29:36.023 --> 29:52.362
okay this room here is the library which was built to house the collection

30:25.417 --> 30:33.668
It's the, when people think about the library, this is what they think of.

30:33.688 --> 30:40.036
A very large library, there's 2,000 places for readers.

30:40.056 --> 30:43.039
The problem is for the library as a whole.

30:43.059 --> 30:49.207
There are not many reader seats here, but the library as a whole has got over 2,000 reader seats.

30:49.608 --> 30:52.131
Do you all tourists in here?

30:52.331 --> 30:55.255
Only the ballet, I don't think.

30:55.673 --> 31:00.681
So I have a little privilege to walk here.

31:01.582 --> 31:07.732
Is this stone all... This is the original medieval facade of the library.

31:08.012 --> 31:11.618
What you're actually coming with.

31:11.658 --> 31:12.880
This is the staircase.

31:12.940 --> 31:15.083
This is the 17th century staircase.

31:19.214 --> 31:21.057
What is the stone?

31:21.097 --> 31:26.187
Is this a regional granite or something?

31:31.837 --> 31:35.664
I ask a lot of foolish questions sometimes.

31:35.684 --> 31:37.948
Sometimes just for detail, it's nice to know.

31:49.454 --> 32:01.455
other elements yeah and that seal over there and that beside would be that's that's crest yeah that's i think that's the royal arms
