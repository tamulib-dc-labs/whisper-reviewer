WEBVTT

00:01.938 --> 00:03.220
I'm just going home.

00:03.941 --> 00:05.283
How far do you live from here, by the way?

00:05.463 --> 00:06.805
I live from 1950.

00:06.825 --> 00:07.806
I love that description.

00:07.846 --> 00:12.533
You talk about this is the naked city, you know, there's 8 million people in the naked city.

00:13.054 --> 00:18.502
And here you are living across the street from a place that has stories, has memories.

00:19.483 --> 00:20.344
Yeah.

00:21.366 --> 00:23.789
You really read the book, didn't you?

00:23.809 --> 00:25.271
Pleasure to deal with it, Nick.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.795
Thank you.

00:27.815 --> 00:28.396
There's feeling.

00:28.456 --> 00:31.540
I mean, there's feeling on every page.

00:32.127 --> 00:35.271
I don't want to ask you, again, questions that are in the book.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.153
You can ask me anything.

00:37.273 --> 00:45.143
I almost feel that there are certain things where you describe your experience with the mumps and what it did to you.

00:45.303 --> 00:47.867
There's no reason why you have to put that in the book.

00:48.007 --> 00:50.590
Except that it explains a lot of my screwing around.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.694
Except that it explains a lot of what happened to you.

00:53.714 --> 01:00.362
I always wanted to make up for that, reassure myself on that.

01:03.110 --> 01:07.435
And also, I didn't connect with women until I was twenty.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.117
Nothing.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.578
That was not uncommon, though.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.781
Boy, you made it from last time, though.

01:12.801 --> 01:15.644
Well, I have, yes.

01:15.664 --> 01:20.669
But, I mean, you can't tell the story of a life and leave out something as central as that.

01:20.689 --> 01:21.250
I hesitate.

01:21.550 --> 01:24.754
In the book, I hesitate about telling this, because it's embarrassing.

01:24.774 --> 01:25.755
It'll embarrass some people.

01:26.276 --> 01:29.760
It shouldn't be embarrassed, because I'm telling you, I'm not embarrassed by it.

01:29.780 --> 01:30.180
So what?

01:32.303 --> 01:36.128
But again, it comes back to, you certainly, you must have made a commitment.

01:36.669 --> 01:38.592
I'm either going to tell it or I'm not going to tell it.

01:38.612 --> 01:38.992
You got it.

01:39.373 --> 01:39.673
That's it.

01:40.054 --> 01:41.155
That's it, exactly what you said.

01:41.175 --> 01:42.437
Otherwise I'm jerking off.

01:42.617 --> 01:43.278
Pardon me.

01:43.579 --> 01:44.680
Otherwise I'm playing with myself.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.324
Going halfway, going halfway, be ashamed of myself later.

01:47.644 --> 01:51.790
I'm not ashamed of anything in that book.

01:51.850 --> 01:54.554
And the most important critics to you were your children.

01:55.796 --> 01:58.720
Critics, not critics, but I mean readers.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.682
No, it wasn't that they were the most important.

02:00.702 --> 02:01.163
They were...

02:02.712 --> 02:05.817
the ones I was most anxious about and really waited for.

02:05.957 --> 02:10.986
I actually waited to see what my wife and my daughters would say about it.

02:11.006 --> 02:18.478
And one daughter kept putting it off, putting it off, because she was either afraid of it or whatever the hell, and she liked it 90%.

02:20.261 --> 02:21.283
My sons read it right away.

02:22.305 --> 02:23.026
I have three sons.

02:23.046 --> 02:24.469
They read it right away.

02:24.489 --> 02:25.470
One son made the index.

02:27.774 --> 02:28.956
You mentioned also I love

02:30.117 --> 02:47.483
Again, the picture, there's a picture in there, the cliché, there's a picture worth a thousand words, where you show that picture of the group, this bold, zealous, revolutionary group, and you see a bunch of bored, pissed off people sitting there.

02:47.503 --> 02:48.205
They hated each other.

02:48.225 --> 02:48.866
They hated each other.

02:48.886 --> 02:49.587
Almost hated each other.

02:49.607 --> 02:51.169
They were on the verge of hating each other.

02:51.329 --> 02:53.813
And you just say, let's look at this picture.

02:54.485 --> 02:56.608
That's my professional, Nick.

02:56.628 --> 02:57.269
It's wonderful.

02:57.769 --> 03:03.076
To me, I've never seen that device, I have to call it a device, used in a book, and it says so much.

03:03.116 --> 03:09.064
And it does, the picture is telling us just about what's going to happen.

03:09.084 --> 03:19.277
Was Viva Zapata, was that kind of, you talked about the strike plays and the theater of action, is this kind of a statement

03:19.882 --> 03:24.627
a political statement, or is it just... He was a party, yes, it was an anti-communist statement.

03:24.647 --> 03:25.608
Uh-huh.

03:25.628 --> 03:34.818
It was an anti-communist statement, saying this guy created a revolution, and then he didn't take advantage of it, he didn't use it, and he found it cruel to people, in fact, got out of it.

03:36.360 --> 03:48.794
I love when you're also describing when you joined the Communist Party, and then you're quoting your own journal, revolution, blah, blah, blah, and you say, who the hell did I think I was?

03:48.814 --> 03:48.994
I mean...

03:49.666 --> 03:51.969
Who the hell did I think I was, right?

03:51.989 --> 03:52.890
Who the hell did I think?

03:52.930 --> 03:56.173
What did I think I was capable of doing?

03:56.534 --> 03:57.955
Some little piss part of a kid.

03:57.995 --> 04:00.939
And that goes for the other communists who were all talking that way at that time.

04:01.279 --> 04:03.241
It was the, you know, it was the thirties.

04:04.102 --> 04:06.645
It was the thirties, early thirties, thirty-four.

04:07.546 --> 04:18.238
And these guys would begin to talk about themselves and actually change this enormous country with an enormous middle class and enormous goodwill towards the country.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.650
It was really ridiculous, something to laugh at.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.931
Who the hell did we think we were?

04:23.273 --> 04:24.874
You also say the theatre is a weapon.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.216
Do you believe that still?

04:26.416 --> 04:27.437
No, I believed it then.

04:28.218 --> 04:34.404
I mean, that was the essence of what the communists thought of the theatre, that they could change people's ways of thinking through it.

04:36.326 --> 04:39.109
I think it has changed some ways.

04:39.129 --> 04:45.335
I think people have been affected by some of the films they've made, and plays they've done.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.977
That was just something I wanted to ask you about.

04:47.260 --> 05:04.407
The only guy didn't bring a photographer.

05:05.548 --> 05:06.910
Better the way he's doing it, don't you think?

05:07.011 --> 05:08.793
Well, I'll tell you.

05:08.853 --> 05:10.176
Let me just shut this off for a second.

05:10.877 --> 05:13.180
I'll go back on now.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.484
You're going back to the interview now?

05:15.564 --> 05:15.664
Yeah.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.592
I will wrap it up pretty soon, too.

05:18.952 --> 05:19.373
My word?

05:20.995 --> 05:23.438
Just whenever you feel like you have to run, let me know.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.021
Okay.

05:26.041 --> 05:30.748
You said one thing on the Today Show which I liked, which impressed me.

05:32.009 --> 05:36.275
You said, one thing people have to understand is that these were not witch hunts.

05:37.817 --> 05:38.638
I hate that word.

05:38.658 --> 05:39.419
It's just a lie.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.203
Maybe you could just expand a little bit on that.

05:42.223 --> 05:42.463
Yeah, I can.

05:42.483 --> 05:45.347
Witch hunt means there's a hunt for something that doesn't exist.

05:45.901 --> 05:48.105
You can't say that communists don't exist.

05:48.285 --> 05:51.670
Did you read a book by Alan Feinstein?

05:51.690 --> 05:51.850
No.

05:52.251 --> 05:58.261
Published by Knopf, too, about his case and all that, all about the communists that were in the State Department.

05:59.723 --> 06:00.745
You know what happened in England?

06:00.765 --> 06:03.569
They found communists all through their goddamn government.

06:03.589 --> 06:05.452
We had communists in the trade unions.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.257
Okay, so they weren't dangerous.

06:08.337 --> 06:09.278
They could have been.

06:09.919 --> 06:11.742
Yeah, Wichhorn says the thing doesn't exist.

06:11.762 --> 06:12.263
Bullshit.

06:12.918 --> 06:14.400
And all the liberals went for it.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.002
They still go for it.

06:16.042 --> 06:16.963
They love that phrase.

06:17.403 --> 06:20.286
You have never heard an ex-communist use witch hunt.

06:20.306 --> 06:20.827
I never have.

06:22.008 --> 06:23.130
They never called a witch hunt.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.231
That's very interesting.

06:24.251 --> 06:24.571
Very.

06:25.392 --> 06:27.214
Tells the whole story right there in one shot.

06:27.895 --> 06:29.117
What do they call it?

06:30.238 --> 06:30.779
Something else.

06:30.979 --> 06:31.279
Depends.

06:31.299 --> 06:32.160
I mean, they don't like it.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.702
I didn't like that committee themselves.

06:33.722 --> 06:34.943
Two of the members lied to me.

06:34.963 --> 06:35.584
I didn't like that.

06:36.391 --> 06:38.213
They said, this is just private between us.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.133
We're not going to tell anybody.

06:39.153 --> 06:41.135
And he ran and called up California.

06:41.195 --> 06:46.520
Well, the one thing in Miller's book, remember that he said the one guy said he'd call it off if he'd introduce him to Maryland?

06:47.721 --> 06:49.723
I don't believe that.

06:49.963 --> 06:50.864
No, no, no, no, no.

06:50.884 --> 06:52.425
It may be true, but I had nothing to do with it.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.226
I know, but I'm just talking about it.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.567
I don't know what Miller did.

06:54.587 --> 06:55.348
I didn't read his book.

06:55.508 --> 06:57.370
It's not a bad book.

06:57.390 --> 06:58.691
I hear it's a pretty good book.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.132
He does fly around, though.

07:00.272 --> 07:00.693
I mean, he does.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.874
He calls it time dance.

07:02.194 --> 07:05.757
Again, we're not discussing his book or your book together, but...

07:06.361 --> 07:09.284
I did an interview with him, by the way, when he was up in Boston.

07:09.424 --> 07:12.667
I'll suspect, if you'd like, I'll send you a copy of that story when I send you a copy.

07:12.707 --> 07:13.788
It's a pretty good story.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.389
Do you know my address?

07:15.409 --> 07:16.250
No, I'd love to have it.

07:16.330 --> 07:17.511
I'm giving it to you right now.

07:17.531 --> 07:18.192
Okay.

07:18.212 --> 07:18.972
174 East 95.

07:20.214 --> 07:20.634
East 95.

07:20.654 --> 07:20.994
10028.

07:21.415 --> 07:22.696
10028.

07:22.996 --> 07:26.019
That's all.

07:26.039 --> 07:30.162
Okay, and I'll send you this, and then when the Greek piece comes out... Send that.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.506
It's a nice little magazine, you know, and you'd be surprised.

07:33.526 --> 07:35.187
It goes all over the United States.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.123
And Dukakis loved the piece.

07:38.303 --> 07:39.064
He absolutely did.

07:39.084 --> 07:44.152
He came up at this press conference, and the guys that owned the paper said, what a great piece.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.796
He told him the magazine with my picture, which I took on.

07:46.816 --> 07:47.917
He said, what a great piece.

07:48.077 --> 07:48.818
Thank you very much.

07:49.239 --> 07:49.660
He said that?

07:49.860 --> 07:50.160
He did.

07:50.901 --> 07:52.243
I asked him tough questions, too.

07:52.323 --> 07:54.126
I mean, I asked him.

07:54.386 --> 07:57.230
The Greeks, a lot of the Greek people think you only come to them when you need money.

07:58.673 --> 07:59.374
Who says that?

07:59.434 --> 08:00.415
I said, a lot of people.

08:00.631 --> 08:01.253
Is it true?

08:01.634 --> 08:05.023
You know, why have you never appointed a Greek to an important position?

08:05.043 --> 08:05.825
It is important.

08:05.865 --> 08:10.056
He probably fears being called at, you know... What's there to fear?

08:10.117 --> 08:13.065
It hasn't stopped Mario Cuomo from putting all the Italians in.

08:13.085 --> 08:15.752
That didn't stop Jack Kennedy from putting all the Irish in, did it?

08:16.133 --> 08:16.193
No.

08:16.443 --> 08:17.024
You have to.

08:17.044 --> 08:20.009
A person has an obligation to bring his people along.

08:20.229 --> 08:20.890
I think it's true.

08:21.251 --> 08:21.792
He never did.

08:22.132 --> 08:25.418
I guess he felt that he'd be called a professional Greek or something.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.042
Well, again, he was probably... He's just got to get out of it.

08:28.062 --> 08:28.964
He's got to do what you said.

08:29.064 --> 08:29.785
I think he's done it.

08:29.845 --> 08:31.328
I mean, he's dancing the calamity.

08:31.348 --> 08:33.211
Who's the guy he fired, his best friend?

08:33.291 --> 08:33.712
Sasso.

08:34.032 --> 08:34.633
Yeah, what is that?

08:34.713 --> 08:35.314
Why did he do that?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.518
Is Sasso still with him?

08:37.839 --> 08:38.800
He's in the background.

08:39.261 --> 08:39.902
He's around him.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.731
He replaced him with a woman who's terrific, Susan Estridge.

08:44.032 --> 08:44.572
She's good.

08:44.593 --> 08:45.994
She's spectacular.

08:46.034 --> 08:47.136
She's doing the campaign.

08:47.436 --> 08:52.082
And he's got a guy who's the best money raiser in the world.

08:52.102 --> 08:58.390
I mean, DeFarca's campaign is an excellent organization in unparalleled money raising.

08:58.450 --> 09:02.375
They've got this guy by the name of Fyreman, I think it was Paul Fyreman.

09:03.236 --> 09:04.899
The guy's already raised $28 million.

09:04.939 --> 09:06.801
He's raised as much as he's allowed by law.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.313
You know, he's raised him.

09:08.553 --> 09:09.614
The Greeks give.

09:09.994 --> 09:11.596
Yeah, the Greeks and the Jews give.

09:11.616 --> 09:12.137
Don't forget.

09:12.197 --> 09:12.777
The Jews give.

09:12.797 --> 09:17.001
You've got the two wealthiest ethnic groups in America, the Greeks and the Jews.

09:17.402 --> 09:20.825
Kitty's Jewish, Mike is Greek, and they both would like to see him get in.

09:20.845 --> 09:21.425
Is Kitty pretty?

09:24.068 --> 09:25.249
Some would think so.

09:25.289 --> 09:26.230
She used to be a dancer.

09:27.931 --> 09:30.514
Why does he like her so much?

09:30.554 --> 09:30.934
I don't know.

09:30.954 --> 09:31.975
She gives him a hard on.

09:31.995 --> 09:33.577
What's the use of Kitty about her?

09:33.597 --> 09:34.418
It goes way back.

09:34.498 --> 09:36.940
I mean, he's been obsessed with her, you know.

09:38.185 --> 09:39.407
Is he a very neat guy?

09:39.868 --> 09:40.810
Oh, he's meticulous.

09:40.990 --> 09:43.155
I notice him sitting in a photograph like this.

09:43.175 --> 09:45.900
Oh, yeah, and he's got the socks that come up to here, you know.

09:46.741 --> 09:48.204
There's not a wrinkle in them.

09:48.224 --> 09:53.815
No, I mean, you do see certain things.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.504
There's a terrific book on here from Houghton Mifflin.

09:57.524 --> 09:58.705
It's very good, by the way.

09:58.725 --> 09:59.326
I recommend it.

09:59.406 --> 10:00.467
Which book is that?

10:00.487 --> 10:00.948
Does it come out?

10:01.068 --> 10:01.749
Yeah, it's out.

10:01.929 --> 10:03.151
There are a couple of them.

10:03.171 --> 10:08.337
Make sure if you get one, get the one from Houghton Mifflin, Dukakis, the Odyssey, or something like that.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.339
In fact, I reviewed it for this Greek magazine again.

10:10.399 --> 10:12.341
I developed Dukakis books.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.863
I've got to talk about myself here.

10:14.624 --> 10:16.666
Don't do that.

10:16.686 --> 10:22.333
After I just read a book about where I talked about myself on the pages, I'll think you're strange.

10:22.769 --> 10:25.854
Only 800 pages.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.278
The art of the masked observer.

10:28.298 --> 10:29.139
I love that.

10:29.159 --> 10:29.840
The witch.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.282
The masked observer.

10:31.623 --> 10:33.506
Talking about yourself.

10:33.526 --> 10:38.133
Well, let's finish with the House Un-American thing and then be done with it about the witch hunt thing.

10:38.153 --> 10:38.774
It doesn't bother me.

10:38.814 --> 10:39.575
Don't worry about it.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.177
Okay, but I don't want to spend a lot of time on it.

10:41.197 --> 10:46.025
Let's finish with it and fuck off with it.

10:46.946 --> 10:47.066
Okay.

10:47.087 --> 10:48.709
We ought to wrap up on it, but...

10:49.465 --> 10:52.549
Looking back on those days, do you feel foolish about ever?

10:52.569 --> 10:52.930
No.

10:53.130 --> 10:53.811
What the hell?

10:54.291 --> 10:56.775
No more than the country was foolish at all.

10:56.795 --> 11:00.339
But I mean for... What else could I do?

11:00.359 --> 11:04.004
I mean, I think if I did, I saw it do the opposite and did the opposite and did the opposite.

11:04.024 --> 11:04.785
I thought, this is terrible.

11:04.805 --> 11:05.746
I don't believe the word.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.769
What were you personally rebelling against?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.491
The communists.

11:09.511 --> 11:12.035
No, I mean when you signed on with them.

11:12.055 --> 11:12.956
Oh, then?

11:13.216 --> 11:13.557
Yeah.

11:13.957 --> 11:16.881
I guess way down deep as my father.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.363
You know, I get that written down here.

11:18.383 --> 11:19.084
That's my sense.

11:19.435 --> 11:22.299
Way down deep, that's why.

11:22.319 --> 11:28.488
Because you say, as I get older, I look in the mirror and who do I see more and more of?

11:28.588 --> 11:28.748
Yeah.

11:31.031 --> 11:32.393
Is there irony in that?

11:33.535 --> 11:34.055
Yeah.

11:34.155 --> 11:36.659
What you were rebelling against, you now see?

11:36.679 --> 11:37.520
I guess there is, yeah.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.122
That's a good point, isn't it?

11:39.142 --> 11:39.863
Miller said that, too.

11:39.883 --> 11:40.464
He said that.

11:40.524 --> 11:42.347
He said, I look in the mirror and see my father's face.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.909
He said it better than I say it.

11:44.049 --> 11:45.211
That's what he said somewhere.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.936
He said, I look in the mirror when I shave and I see my father's face.

11:50.452 --> 11:53.937
That's very succinctly good.

11:54.257 --> 11:55.860
I'm not joking.

11:55.940 --> 11:59.144
Two of white walls.

11:59.164 --> 12:01.388
You're a wealthy publisher.

12:01.408 --> 12:02.209
The House of God.

12:02.229 --> 12:02.710
God bless them.

12:02.810 --> 12:03.431
God bless them.

12:03.451 --> 12:04.552
They're wonderful.

12:04.572 --> 12:06.855
Don't you love being in a room filled with books?

12:07.196 --> 12:09.399
Yeah, the only thing I always feel is, what can I steal?

12:10.220 --> 12:11.863
I would strain myself so much.

12:11.923 --> 12:12.143
Why?

12:12.463 --> 12:13.906
Make sure they're first editions.

12:14.006 --> 12:15.668
See these fucking books here.

12:15.688 --> 12:18.332
These are, I think, ten of them all.

12:18.352 --> 12:19.834
I love that thing.

12:20.287 --> 12:26.415
That little story about where Brando picked up the glove and you said that was not you at all.

12:26.456 --> 12:29.420
That was just... No, I mean, I let it go.

12:29.500 --> 12:29.980
I proved it.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.505
Except that you had the sense not to butt in and say anything.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.188
Nothing to fear.

12:35.208 --> 12:38.052
What do you think when you see something like that happening?

12:39.053 --> 12:40.876
I mean, as a director... You feel thrilled.

12:42.338 --> 12:43.179
You feel grateful.

12:43.379 --> 12:45.442
And does it make sense when you see it happening?

12:45.682 --> 12:48.266
Yeah, just quick.

12:48.286 --> 12:48.987
Emotional sense.

12:49.668 --> 12:49.888
Wonderful.

12:50.358 --> 12:53.743
Is that kind of like improvisation as the jazz guys would say?

12:53.763 --> 13:01.095
It is in a way, but it's just the way that he's taught us an actor to play the scene really, and whatever happened is part of the real scene.

13:01.836 --> 13:04.341
But it never occurred to him to say, cut, cut, cut.

13:04.481 --> 13:05.563
Never occurred to me, no.

13:05.763 --> 13:07.506
But I mean him either, the actor.

13:07.526 --> 13:08.728
No, he never would do that.

13:09.849 --> 13:11.532
Did he enjoy doing it?

13:11.572 --> 13:14.577
He played until I said cut, no matter how long it was.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.931
And everybody kept quiet until you said cut.

13:16.951 --> 13:19.956
You're goddamn right.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.682
They didn't, they heard from me.

13:23.922 --> 13:24.864
They never did it again.

13:24.904 --> 13:25.745
Did it ever cut?

13:26.146 --> 13:30.613
Did you ever almost say cut, you know, when you saw this thing?

13:30.713 --> 13:35.421
I love two cocky socks up to here.

13:35.441 --> 13:36.723
What did you ask?

13:36.743 --> 13:40.429
We're not a wrinkle in them either.

13:40.449 --> 13:41.070
What did you say?

13:41.438 --> 13:41.879
I don't know.

13:41.939 --> 13:43.360
I'm trying to cut you off.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.243
I don't think it was that important.

13:46.464 --> 13:47.425
We've got that.

13:48.487 --> 13:49.268
We've got that.

13:49.408 --> 13:51.731
We've got just about everything here, you know.

13:51.751 --> 13:52.912
The theater of action.

13:53.293 --> 13:54.474
Strike away.

13:54.514 --> 13:57.758
What a pompous thing to call anything, the theater of action.

13:57.778 --> 13:58.759
Those were the days, Nick.

14:00.161 --> 14:00.762
Those were the days.

14:00.922 --> 14:02.604
And those kids didn't have a quarter.

14:03.806 --> 14:08.171
Do you remember the story in the book where they got paid with 20 pumpkin pies?

14:08.291 --> 14:08.431
Jesus.

14:08.512 --> 14:09.413
Eat anything.

14:09.433 --> 14:10.534
Apples.

14:12.016 --> 14:14.539
Vegetables, half shot, anything.

14:14.559 --> 14:15.640
I mean, they were so devoted.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.663
They lived together, they worked together every day.

14:18.343 --> 14:19.064
I couldn't take it.

14:19.465 --> 14:20.506
I don't like group living.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.630
I don't like, what do you call these things that Jews set up in there in Israel?

14:23.690 --> 14:24.070
Kibbutz.

14:24.190 --> 14:24.631
I hate them.

14:24.931 --> 14:26.773
I went to one, stayed there a week, drove me nuts.

14:27.975 --> 14:30.818
Remember the hippies back in the 60s called them demons?

14:32.019 --> 14:33.281
I don't like the hippies either.

14:33.621 --> 14:35.464
I don't like group this, that, the other.

14:35.484 --> 14:36.785
I was in the group theater, I didn't like it.

14:38.467 --> 14:41.871
I like being by myself, except when I want to be with somebody.

14:42.745 --> 14:45.549
And as an artist, do you think that that produces your best work?

14:45.569 --> 14:46.270
It's the whole thing.

14:47.632 --> 14:50.036
There's no such thing, I think, as art by committee anyway.

14:51.078 --> 14:53.261
The King James Bible, that's about it.

14:53.281 --> 14:58.769
That's kind of a question, actually.

14:59.230 --> 15:06.441
Play can be a product of a group activity, but there has to be a very strong leader, or else they go wild.

15:08.965 --> 15:09.265
Okay.

15:09.906 --> 15:11.689
You know what, I'm going to wrap this up pretty soon.

15:12.597 --> 15:14.720
Are you threatening me a promise?

15:14.760 --> 15:17.204
No, because I don't want to.

15:17.224 --> 15:20.249
I love the fact that you put aside money in your will for a great party.

15:21.151 --> 15:22.433
It's going to be a celebration.

15:23.795 --> 15:26.018
You don't want weeping, mourning people.

15:26.038 --> 15:28.262
I don't want anybody weeping over me, because why weep over me?

15:28.282 --> 15:29.023
I had a great life.

15:30.526 --> 15:37.877
I mean, if it stopped five minutes after you got here, if I fall on the floor, no, no, nothing.

15:37.897 --> 15:38.598
I had a great life.

15:38.618 --> 15:39.239
Don't you think so?

15:39.500 --> 15:39.600
Okay.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.721
Look at the life I had.

15:41.021 --> 15:41.742
Look at it.

15:42.943 --> 15:43.364
Everything.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.685
Everything.

15:44.705 --> 15:46.847
I had it all, including pain.

15:47.988 --> 15:48.989
I think pain is very good.

15:49.009 --> 15:49.870
It's very stimulating.

15:49.970 --> 15:50.871
It's important, isn't it?

15:51.552 --> 16:01.162
Well, anyway, I had a great life, so I don't want any moaning and groaning, and they can come and take my sweaters away and my books and everything they want.

16:01.182 --> 16:06.046
The only way you have catharsis in Greek pain at play is through terror and pity.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.248
I mean, there has to be pain.

16:07.268 --> 16:08.709
You have to suffer before you can have it.

16:08.749 --> 16:09.570
I don't want any pity.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.146
I don't want any terror.

16:12.186 --> 16:12.887
I had all that.

16:12.907 --> 16:13.648
I don't want terror.

16:13.668 --> 16:14.448
I don't want pity.

16:14.468 --> 16:17.372
I don't want catharsis.

16:17.392 --> 16:21.536
You do say that the only plays that you can relate to are contemporary plays.

16:21.556 --> 16:21.756
It's true.

16:22.998 --> 16:23.418
I have some.

16:23.438 --> 16:24.439
You've got the New York Times.

16:24.459 --> 16:25.280
I read that every day.

16:25.581 --> 16:26.121
It's a pleasure.

16:26.702 --> 16:27.623
I get something out of it.

16:28.123 --> 16:29.405
I read the news, too.

16:30.005 --> 16:30.866
I follow sports.

16:31.087 --> 16:32.388
I follow people.

16:32.428 --> 16:33.309
I follow gossip.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.450
I think it's all important.

16:36.372 --> 16:36.933
More years.

16:37.373 --> 16:38.334
Give me three wishes.

16:38.355 --> 16:38.815
That's the end.

16:39.014 --> 16:40.375
Not three, did you say three?

16:40.395 --> 16:41.296
No, you said three wishes.

16:41.336 --> 16:42.798
Oh, yeah, three wishes, yeah.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.499
I said wishes, I quoted you.

16:44.539 --> 16:46.722
Three shit, that's not it.

16:46.742 --> 16:49.104
Three shit, that's right.

16:49.124 --> 16:50.065
I want twenty more years.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.628
I'm seventy-eight and a half now, I'm seventy-ninth year.

16:54.149 --> 16:55.630
I want to go to just under a hundred.

16:56.571 --> 16:59.134
My father's the same, he's seventy-seven.

16:59.274 --> 17:01.696
He looks wonderful, a little fat, he loves to eat.

17:01.736 --> 17:04.799
But other than that, he's just a good man.

17:04.819 --> 17:05.840
I try not to eat too much.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.502
I shouldn't have eaten those goddamn cakes.

17:08.562 --> 17:09.183
You work out?

17:10.124 --> 17:12.186
No, I work in the garden.

17:12.307 --> 17:14.049
I hate walking out, but I walk every day.

17:14.109 --> 17:18.073
I walk two miles or three miles and try to walk fast.

17:19.075 --> 17:19.976
And I am in good shape.

17:20.596 --> 17:22.339
I'm not overweight.

17:22.359 --> 17:23.700
I wish I could say that.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.042
You've got a little belly.

17:25.222 --> 17:27.164
It's as big as it's ever been.

17:27.184 --> 17:28.346
You know, I've seen bigger bellies.

17:28.406 --> 17:31.289
Well, I mean, with me, it's as big as it's ever been.

17:31.349 --> 17:32.451
Oh, as big as it's ever been.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.272
What's your wife say?

17:33.292 --> 17:34.053
Doesn't she get married?

17:34.253 --> 17:35.194
Yeah, oh yeah.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.208
She's right.

17:37.228 --> 17:37.929
You shouldn't have it.

17:38.229 --> 17:39.130
What are you, 45?

17:39.170 --> 17:39.691
Something like that.

17:39.711 --> 17:40.251
Precisely.

17:40.572 --> 17:42.033
I'll be 45 next week.

17:42.073 --> 17:43.114
You shouldn't have it.

17:43.134 --> 17:45.096
You should start to take off weight now.

17:45.116 --> 17:47.398
When you're 55, you should be 10 pounds lighter.

17:47.418 --> 17:48.039
That's not much.

17:48.079 --> 17:48.139
No.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.181
I can do it, too.

17:50.201 --> 17:51.663
And I do work out.

17:51.723 --> 17:53.605
It's boring.

17:53.685 --> 17:55.206
I hate gyms.

17:55.226 --> 17:56.888
I don't like the smell of the gym locker room.

17:58.549 --> 18:00.912
Discipline is everything.

18:00.932 --> 18:02.093
What else can I ask you?

18:02.343 --> 18:06.568
Here's one, here's one good one I'm going to ask.

18:07.929 --> 18:14.597
Because I really resent the assertion, and you seem to have agreed with it, that you are an extinct volcano.

18:14.637 --> 18:19.462
That's an English critic.

18:19.502 --> 18:20.664
I didn't say it.

18:20.944 --> 18:23.226
An American critic didn't say it.

18:23.407 --> 18:24.908
I've been panned by some critics, you know.

18:25.109 --> 18:25.569
I'm sure.

18:25.629 --> 18:28.853
There's a guy up in Boston who just panned me today.

18:28.873 --> 18:29.974
I just got to know this today.

18:29.994 --> 18:30.915
He wrote in The Globe.

18:31.604 --> 18:33.827
And he said all my anecdotes were fake.

18:34.968 --> 18:35.829
Really?

18:35.849 --> 18:38.973
How does he propose to prove that?

18:39.774 --> 18:42.037
There's not a fake anecdote in the book.

18:42.057 --> 18:43.118
Who's the guy that wrote this?

18:43.379 --> 18:44.861
That Kevin Kelly.

18:44.881 --> 18:46.182
I don't know who he is.

18:46.202 --> 18:46.883
I'll have to check.

18:46.903 --> 18:48.004
Is it today's Globe?

18:48.024 --> 18:48.665
That's what I hear.

18:48.805 --> 18:51.108
I've got the Globe.

18:51.148 --> 18:54.733
Some guys coming tomorrow from the Globe interview me, so I'll have some fun with them.

18:54.753 --> 18:55.474
I wonder who it is.

18:55.914 --> 18:56.996
I beat them, huh?

18:57.016 --> 18:57.757
I'm here ahead of them.

18:57.777 --> 18:57.997
What?

18:58.117 --> 19:00.079
They're my competition, the Globe.

19:00.099 --> 19:00.360
The Globe?

19:01.141 --> 19:01.341
Yeah.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.359
Well, I'm the other paper, the smaller one.

19:03.479 --> 19:04.520
It goes by that review.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.882
You've got no competition.

19:06.102 --> 19:06.463
I don't.

19:07.063 --> 19:11.408
I mean, do you feel like an extinct volcano, a spent force?

19:11.528 --> 19:12.229
Do I look like one?

19:12.269 --> 19:12.569
No.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.051
I'm not.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.553
But I mean creatively, artistically.

19:16.093 --> 19:17.755
I mean, these things count too.

19:19.357 --> 19:21.359
Just because you're not doing a play or a movie.

19:21.379 --> 19:23.221
They're worth all my movies put together.

19:23.261 --> 19:24.222
That book is there.

19:24.242 --> 19:25.264
Yeah, well, I mean, that's the point.

19:25.284 --> 19:26.885
How can an extinct volcano write that book?

19:26.925 --> 19:27.586
Explain that to me.

19:27.606 --> 19:28.307
That's the point.

19:28.743 --> 19:34.529
I did an interview with this guy, everybody's, what's his name, George Amado, you ever heard of him, the Brazilian?

19:35.470 --> 19:36.672
Famous, famous writer.

19:38.173 --> 19:39.054
What's his name, Jamado?

19:39.194 --> 19:39.835
Amado.

19:39.915 --> 19:41.156
Amado, yes, my wife likes it.

19:41.176 --> 19:41.917
George Amado.

19:42.077 --> 19:43.119
My wife loves his books.

19:43.259 --> 19:45.561
Nice, nice guy.

19:47.123 --> 19:52.068
He lived in exile, he was a communist, he was thrown out of his country, he had to live in Paris.

19:53.350 --> 19:55.212
Amado, my wife loves his books.

19:55.232 --> 19:56.533
Amado, A-M-A-D-O.

19:56.553 --> 19:58.395
I know, that's the one.

19:58.645 --> 19:59.266
What's he like?

19:59.827 --> 20:00.167
Lovely.

20:00.247 --> 20:01.329
He doesn't speak any English.

20:01.369 --> 20:05.796
I interviewed him through an interpreter on tape, and it was very good.

20:05.836 --> 20:07.218
But he says he'd give everything.

20:07.238 --> 20:09.060
He's written all these books, great books.

20:09.481 --> 20:09.982
He's funny.

20:10.222 --> 20:10.763
He's funny.

20:10.803 --> 20:12.746
He's a hero in his own life.

20:12.766 --> 20:17.513
But she says, I'd trade six good books for one little poem that I could write.

20:17.573 --> 20:18.574
And I said, for one poem.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.237
I said, how long, a narrative poem?

20:20.257 --> 20:21.619
He said, no, one little poem.

20:21.699 --> 20:23.301
Six lines, he said.

20:23.361 --> 20:26.526
You ever hear about the memoirs?

20:26.877 --> 20:39.840
judge of the Supreme Court who went for a walk with somebody, and the guy asked him what he wanted most now towards the end of his life, and he said, I'd give up all my fame for one good hard-harm like I used to have.

20:40.715 --> 20:42.377
You can't tell what a guy might want.

20:42.518 --> 20:50.389
There's a wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker a couple years ago, I don't know if you remember it, but there's these two old guys sitting in leather chairs in a club.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.350
I didn't see it.

20:51.390 --> 20:54.314
And one of them says, now they tell us masturbation is good for you.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.962
I mean, you know, who needs it now, right?

21:00.683 --> 21:02.225
That's a cute story.

21:02.245 --> 21:04.709
I think I've just about covered everything.

21:05.610 --> 21:05.810
Okay.

21:06.051 --> 21:07.513
Would you kindly... Sure.

21:07.533 --> 21:07.633
Sure.

21:09.824 --> 21:11.847
Would you also inscribe it to my lovely wife?

21:12.368 --> 21:12.789
What's her name?

21:13.590 --> 21:17.136
Put this thing on my name.

21:17.196 --> 21:20.261
I don't know what he... Come downstairs, I'll give it to you.

21:20.281 --> 21:24.247
But it must be a thrill when somebody understands what you're trying to do.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.371
That's what this guy did.

21:26.391 --> 21:30.037
Whether it be a review or somebody you talk to or whatever, I guess that's important.

21:30.257 --> 21:33.021
In a book, in a movie, or a play.

21:33.061 --> 21:34.684
I don't want it anymore, now I've got this.

21:37.735 --> 21:39.778
You saved everything, huh?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.161
Those pictures with the fezzers.

21:42.682 --> 21:45.366
They look like the bottom of a drawer somewhere.

21:45.486 --> 21:47.329
See, that's a real picture right there, holding the book.

21:47.349 --> 21:47.950
You know that?

21:53.318 --> 21:53.438
Yeah.

21:53.458 --> 21:57.664
I really love this book.

21:57.684 --> 22:03.492
I bet you never worried that it would be so long that you'd never finish it, right, I hope?

22:04.273 --> 22:06.797
No, I just kept picking away.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.586
It's a great little camera.

22:14.787 --> 22:16.349
They gave me some pictures here, too.

22:19.832 --> 22:21.234
They gave me some old ones.

22:21.714 --> 22:24.236
There's one picture here of me kidding myself.

22:25.658 --> 22:26.779
Did you read the description?

22:26.819 --> 22:27.420
Remember that?

22:27.460 --> 22:28.441
There I am walking behind.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.443
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

22:30.463 --> 22:32.164
Usually I knew what I was doing, but I didn't know.

22:32.505 --> 22:38.050
Well, these must have all been cropped by an art director who... My editor.

22:38.536 --> 22:42.787
My second editor, Bob, got me to the first one to see Kathy Hardin in the second.

22:42.807 --> 22:46.517
They've worked so hard over this.

22:46.537 --> 22:47.961
Okay, we checked everything off.

22:47.981 --> 22:48.663
I got everything.

22:48.743 --> 22:49.826
I don't think I missed anything.

22:49.846 --> 22:50.829
And this was really great.

22:51.932 --> 22:54.158
You've got a good strong handshake, my friend.

22:54.178 --> 22:54.739
Let me hear...
