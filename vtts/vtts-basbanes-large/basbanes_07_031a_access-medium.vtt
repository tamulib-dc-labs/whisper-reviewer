00:02.680 --> 00:13.796
When I was starting out in rare books at Dawson's Bookshop in Los Angeles, Norman Strauss was starting out in advertising.

00:14.717 --> 00:17.722
And so we have known each other since about 1930.

00:18.503 --> 00:18.803
Really?

00:19.244 --> 00:24.411
And as I say, he was starting advertising.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.155
And we kept in touch.

00:27.216 --> 00:30.000
I used to sell him books mostly by mail.

00:30.701 --> 00:32.383
And then finally he was

00:32.633 --> 00:38.279
promoted over 80 vice presidents into the presidency of the world's biggest advertising agency.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.122
And he went back to New York.

00:41.362 --> 00:53.795
And in the meantime, the Free Library of Philadelphia was picking up or getting a rare book librarian for their collection, which was a marvelous collection.

00:54.435 --> 00:56.357
So I went back to Philadelphia.

00:56.978 --> 01:01.122
And there aren't too many rare book specialists.

01:01.439 --> 01:17.372
So I used to teach a seminar in rare books at Columbia, and I would go up one day a week in the fall semester, and I would take my students, I wouldn't have more than nine or so, over to see Norman.

01:17.555 --> 01:29.352
Because the students could get to the libraries, and they could get to the rare bookshops, but they couldn't get to the private collective unless somebody took them.

01:29.813 --> 01:30.774
So I used to take them there.

01:31.034 --> 01:33.979
So I knew Norman then, you see.

01:34.119 --> 01:36.622
But he was happy to meet with the students.

01:37.383 --> 01:38.445
He loved it.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.808
A lot of collectors might not have agreed to do that.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.651
Well, Norman is different.

01:43.188 --> 01:50.457
For one thing, one of the sorrows in the back of his mind is the fact that he never went to college.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.100
He has taught in universities.

01:53.240 --> 01:59.788
He has been the regent's professor here at the University of California.

02:00.168 --> 02:03.452
He holds several doctorates, but he never got there.

02:04.053 --> 02:12.823
And so he has the greatest sympathy for people to get an education, and he has been

02:13.124 --> 02:22.705
wonderfully generous with the Gleason Library Associates, even more generous with the Bancroft Library.

02:23.327 --> 02:25.010
And there are various places.

02:25.371 --> 02:29.901
When I was the rare book librarian in Philadelphia, he gave us his

02:30.100 --> 02:32.584
wonderful collection of presidential letters.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.267
This was where, Philly?

02:34.287 --> 02:35.209
Philadelphia.

02:35.249 --> 02:36.851
Which institution?

02:36.871 --> 02:39.115
The Free Library of Philadelphia.

02:39.135 --> 02:42.781
I've interviewed Edwin Wolfe, by the way, as part of this research.

02:42.801 --> 02:43.262
Oh, yes.

02:43.643 --> 02:44.785
Yes, he's quite a guy.

02:44.945 --> 02:45.526
He's quite a guy.

02:45.646 --> 02:45.906
Yes.

02:46.187 --> 02:51.636
No, the Free Library is the public library.

02:52.527 --> 02:57.732
The department that I had occupied the whole third floor of that building, if you've been in there.

02:57.752 --> 02:58.313
I have.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.495
Well, Philadelphia is a wonderful book city.

03:01.656 --> 03:05.260
I have never seen so many beautiful books so badly treated in my life.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.002
They're trying to repair things.

03:08.243 --> 03:08.743
Yeah.

03:09.324 --> 03:10.545
But that's correct.

03:10.685 --> 03:14.869
Ed talked about that, as a matter of fact.

03:14.889 --> 03:22.517
Yeah, Ed takes things very enthusiastically, and he gets started one time with, oh, some sort of

03:23.172 --> 03:26.976
You know, that you could piece the books together for a while.

03:27.076 --> 03:32.142
Of course, in about five years, they disintegrated again, but he tried.

03:32.242 --> 03:35.606
Now, why did Mr. Strauss, what was his connection with Philadelphia?

03:36.447 --> 03:39.711
Well, I was there.

03:40.152 --> 03:46.699
And then also, he met the director of the library, Emerson Greenaway.

03:47.557 --> 03:50.160
He sounds like such a generous and giving man.

03:50.420 --> 03:50.800
He is.

03:50.821 --> 03:51.581
He meets people.

03:52.222 --> 03:56.567
Tell me a little bit about how this happens, because I hear so many stories.

03:56.587 --> 04:03.394
He meets somebody, he likes them, and the next thing you know, he's giving a bequest of books.

04:03.574 --> 04:09.861
Well, as I say, he has the greatest sympathy for getting an education.

04:11.423 --> 04:16.348
He has always been a...

04:16.565 --> 04:18.267
browser and bookshops.

04:18.647 --> 04:31.843
Now, the way that this museum started was that when he was about 24, browsing in a bookshop, and he can't remember now which one, he came across a copy of the Silverado Squatters, printed by John Henry Nash.

04:32.323 --> 04:35.587
Well, he has always been very much interested in fine printing.

04:36.288 --> 04:39.131
We have the book out here on exhibit.

04:39.632 --> 04:44.277
He bought the book for the sake of the typography, but naturally he read it.

04:44.864 --> 04:47.488
And immediately became very excited.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.412
As soon as he could, he came up to Mount St.

04:50.472 --> 04:58.623
Helena to the site of the bunkhouse, got interested in Stevenson, and started collecting it.

04:58.643 --> 05:00.806
And that is how the museum started.

05:01.006 --> 05:03.890
But he has had many collections.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.474
Stevenson is just one, I gather.

05:06.494 --> 05:12.542
Yes, Stevenson is just one, but really his major interest, you see.

05:12.725 --> 05:17.838
And that's why I set up a foundation to establish and support this museum.

05:18.119 --> 05:19.743
We are a private foundation.

05:19.823 --> 05:23.252
We have nothing to do with the city, state, or federal government.

05:23.272 --> 05:25.978
We are supported by Norman Strauss.

05:25.999 --> 05:26.720
Now, tell me a little bit.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.367
You do join the public library, though.

05:29.465 --> 05:34.952
Well, we have nothing to do with the public library.

05:35.212 --> 05:37.815
The public library is the Library of St.

05:37.895 --> 05:38.676
Helena.

05:38.696 --> 05:41.800
We are the Violema Foundation, the private foundation.

05:41.820 --> 05:42.321
What do we call it?

05:42.341 --> 05:42.762
What's Violema?

05:42.802 --> 05:46.226
Violema, which was Stevenson's home in Samoa.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.107
Oh, that's nice.

05:47.127 --> 05:59.202
And Mr. Strauss, for years, nine and a half years, we had the museum over in the hatchery, a lovely old stone building.

05:59.738 --> 06:02.422
which Mr. Strauss owned for a time.

06:02.482 --> 06:14.197
Being forward-looking, he felt that the hatchery would presumably always be in private hands, and he said, suppose 50 years from now, a future owner says, get out.

06:14.738 --> 06:15.840
What do you do?

06:16.180 --> 06:28.256
Well, the library was just starting a campaign to put up a building, and so he suggested that the Silver Audi Museum would join forces.

06:28.657 --> 06:29.678
We would pay

06:30.046 --> 06:32.950
for our own building here.

06:32.990 --> 06:38.898
Now, technically we are a wing, but actually, as you see, we are a separate building.

06:39.639 --> 06:43.985
This was built according to our specifications.

06:44.586 --> 06:47.791
We paid considerably more than our share.

06:48.131 --> 06:50.134
It was a great big advantage.

06:50.154 --> 06:58.686
The library wouldn't have gone up as fast as it did if it hadn't been for the Silverado Museum, but that is how we happened to be

06:58.919 --> 07:01.723
And what year was this, that this building was?

07:01.964 --> 07:03.506
We opened up in 79.

07:03.766 --> 07:03.907
I see.

07:04.147 --> 07:09.455
And when, in fact, was the Silverado Museum and Library established?

07:09.656 --> 07:11.078
We are the Silverado Museum.

07:11.138 --> 07:12.099
We're not a library.

07:12.119 --> 07:12.881
That's right.

07:13.021 --> 07:16.586
We have plenty of books, but technically we are a museum.

07:16.606 --> 07:18.569
What year were you established?

07:18.589 --> 07:21.995
We opened up for business the 14th of December of 69.

07:22.035 --> 07:25.500
And moved into these quarters in 1979.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.842
That's right.

07:26.862 --> 07:30.026
Actually, we had been nine and a half years in the other building.

07:30.046 --> 07:30.948
Okay.

07:31.208 --> 07:38.719
Are these artifacts and books and papers, were these all gathered by Mr. Strauss himself?

07:38.739 --> 07:39.520
And me, yes.

07:39.721 --> 07:41.003
And himself.

07:41.363 --> 07:44.007
You see, we have been in existence for 20 years.

07:44.067 --> 07:54.863
When we opened up, Norman gave, as a starter, his wonderful collection of Stevenson, 800 items.

07:55.298 --> 08:08.461
All splendid things like the Child's Garden of Verses that Stevenson gave to his wife and signed, you know, from her subject, the author, and things of that kind.

08:09.282 --> 08:11.727
Stevenson's own copy of his first book.

08:12.728 --> 08:16.375
And so he gave the 800 items.

08:17.016 --> 08:18.859
Today we have over 8,000.

08:19.396 --> 08:23.963
In this building, obviously, just a fraction of these are on exhibit.

08:24.163 --> 08:25.225
That's right.

08:25.245 --> 08:28.069
Well, a lot of them are a bit flat.

08:28.089 --> 08:34.038
For instance, we have over a thousand photographs, largely from the Stevenson family.

08:34.839 --> 08:36.021
And then letters.

08:36.762 --> 08:42.330
We've got a wealth of letters from Fanny and from Stevenson.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.652
How about manuscript material?

08:44.614 --> 08:46.737
We have some of that.

08:47.054 --> 08:48.816
more or less sheets here and there.

08:48.836 --> 08:57.026
For instance, we have two leaves from Jekyll and Hyde, and various manuscripts.

08:57.046 --> 09:01.291
But as I say, so much of the material you don't see.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.956
When did your formal relationship with Mrs. Fels begin?

09:05.997 --> 09:07.438
You mean on this museum?

09:07.499 --> 09:14.547
As I say, I've known them for, well, I guess it's going on 60 years now.

09:14.915 --> 09:30.675
I came out with the Manuscript Society on an expedition I had to San Francisco, and he handled their itinerary.

09:31.116 --> 09:33.178
We were up here one day in St.

09:33.639 --> 09:39.466
Helena, and when he was saying goodbye to me, he said, when are you coming back to California to stay?

09:40.207 --> 09:44.112
And my family had all died in the meantime.

09:44.311 --> 09:47.695
When somebody finds something interesting for me to do.

09:48.436 --> 09:50.738
And Norman was on the telephone a month later.

09:50.798 --> 09:55.143
So I gave the Free Library of Philadelphia five months' notice.

09:55.163 --> 09:55.764
Five months.

09:55.784 --> 10:01.831
And I came out here and officially took over in August of 1970.

10:02.411 --> 10:03.953
And I have been here ever since.

10:03.973 --> 10:06.316
And are you enjoying California, might I ask?

10:06.336 --> 10:10.200
Well, I first came to California in 1924.

10:10.619 --> 10:12.341
lived in Southern California.

10:12.681 --> 10:18.047
And, of course, it was while I was at Dawson's Bookshop in Los Angeles that I met Norman.

10:18.067 --> 10:21.791
We interviewed Glenn Dawson, by the way, Monday morning.

10:21.811 --> 10:28.819
Well, you'll see a picture of Glenn up here, and a picture of Muir, and then here is their father.

10:29.820 --> 10:39.090
So these are my three bosses, Emerson Greenaway, Norman Strauss, and Ernest Dawson.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.491
Oh, it was on the wall.

10:40.741 --> 10:45.328
You've been a book woman all your life, then I gather.

10:45.348 --> 10:54.063
I started in my hometown was Leadville, Colorado, and I went to work in the library there as a junior in high school.

10:56.827 --> 11:02.056
And I wonder when the attraction to rare books began.

11:02.076 --> 11:04.139
I always had it.

11:04.159 --> 11:04.560
Really?

11:04.580 --> 11:07.204
When I was there in Leadville, somebody

11:07.707 --> 11:11.070
Of course, in the mining camp in the early days, you know, you got everybody.

11:11.511 --> 11:21.660
Somebody who had been a book collector had given 17th, 18th century, and 19th century.

11:21.700 --> 11:27.225
They're the comic histories of Greece and Rome and England, for instance.

11:27.245 --> 11:37.495
And I was going around the library there, hunting up these old books, Poets of Oshim and various other books.

11:37.745 --> 11:52.665
early books that I found there, and getting them into a cupboard with a saucer of water and a sponge to combat the dryness, because in Colorado, at 10,000 feet, you had a very dry atmosphere.

11:53.166 --> 11:56.630
So always I have been interested in rare books.

11:57.151 --> 12:01.757
My mother was from Boston on her home with Stone, Massachusetts.

12:01.817 --> 12:04.221
No, we live out in Grafton, which is close to Worcester.

12:04.581 --> 12:05.362
Oh, is that right?

12:05.382 --> 12:07.465
Very close to Stone.

12:08.238 --> 12:08.939
Oh, fine.

12:09.259 --> 12:10.380
Thanks a lot, Al.

12:10.661 --> 12:12.062
You've done nobly.

12:12.603 --> 12:16.808
He sits there and doesn't seem to do anything.

12:16.828 --> 12:18.049
He sells books and makes sense.

12:18.069 --> 12:19.471
He'll bring me back a $20 bill.

12:19.511 --> 12:22.875
A little bit later, another $20.

12:22.955 --> 12:31.665
Let me turn off the light here for just a minute so that we won't have people.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.228
Maybe 15 or 20 more minutes and...

12:34.529 --> 12:36.451
And if there are any other questions, I can call you.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.073
Yes, well, you can.

12:38.494 --> 12:43.380
As I say, I came out here, and I've been working here ever since.

12:43.400 --> 12:52.932
And probably Father Bill told you that Norman is a victim of Parkinson's disease.

12:53.413 --> 12:58.840
He said it would be quite impossible to talk to him, and I appreciate that.

12:58.860 --> 13:03.085
But he also said that you probably know everything there is to know.

13:03.267 --> 13:05.550
I think you probably could talk to him a little.

13:06.612 --> 13:11.959
He's got a crew, a wonderful crew of nurses with him all the time, 24 hours a day.

13:12.019 --> 13:14.202
He has people with him.

13:14.743 --> 13:16.865
And there is one who is a marvel.

13:17.006 --> 13:22.073
She's a therapist and a crack nurse, and she is determined that he is not.

13:22.353 --> 13:29.022
He's enamored of the Davenport, and she is not going to let him lie on the Davenport and grow roots.

13:29.879 --> 13:34.103
The latest thing, they went up to Ashland to the Shakespeare Festival.

13:34.123 --> 13:35.764
They saw a couple of plays up there.

13:36.325 --> 13:40.609
She got him down to the Moscow Circus in San Francisco.

13:41.069 --> 13:48.375
He went down to, he got a notion he wanted to see Le Miserable, and I understand he stuck it out for an hour and a half.

13:48.976 --> 13:54.140
So it might be that Dell could get him to talk.

13:54.161 --> 13:59.245
We are flying back to Massachusetts tomorrow, and I don't think that this is something we could do on the television.

13:59.343 --> 14:00.969
Does he talk on the telephone at all?

14:01.371 --> 14:03.920
He does, but there are times he may be a little confused.

14:03.981 --> 14:10.686
And then also, it seems one of the horrid things about Parkinson's disease is that it affects the vocal cords.

14:10.919 --> 14:13.523
I cannot understand them a lot of the time.

14:13.664 --> 14:19.313
I think, really, that for the purposes of my book, it's going to be quite satisfactory to talk to you, I think.

14:19.333 --> 14:26.986
Well, as I say, he has given... Because his actions speak... What he has done speaks... He has always been a collector.

14:27.547 --> 14:33.477
I am a little interested in... Now, you say he is not formally educated, certainly on the university level.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.060
He educated himself.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.943
He's haunted bookshops.

14:37.396 --> 14:38.037
Always.

14:38.378 --> 14:43.265
And when I would be staying up there with the Strausses, I always thought it was very interesting.

14:43.505 --> 14:48.032
Charlotte and I would be reading mystery stories, and Norman would be reading something that would do him good.

14:48.813 --> 14:49.194
Always.

14:50.095 --> 14:52.219
And you say he always was a collector then?

14:52.840 --> 14:53.380
Always.

14:53.401 --> 14:54.322
All sorts of things.

14:54.442 --> 15:05.479
I wonder at what point he became enamored of rare books of first editions and... Oh, right from the beginning, I think.

15:05.729 --> 15:08.271
You never know where he'd take off to.

15:08.331 --> 15:20.683
Somebody came in one time and said, I'm so sorry that Mr. Strauss isn't around, because I'd like to tell him how much I appreciate the collection on the Panama Canal that he gave to the Stanford Public Library.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.947
I've known him all these years, and this was the first I ever knew that he had any interest in.

15:25.107 --> 15:35.517
Do you have a list or an idea of what collections he could give, just to make it every interesting to list those collections, or what he contributed to libraries?

15:35.783 --> 15:39.528
office, or at least what used to be his office.

15:39.629 --> 15:41.571
I think they could... Where is that?

15:41.872 --> 15:58.316
Well, I would write to Elizabeth Bayer, who is the... She is the treasurer of the... She's on our board of trustees, and she handles all of his business affairs.

15:58.436 --> 15:59.077
And she is here?

15:59.478 --> 16:00.219
She is in St.

16:00.239 --> 16:00.980
Helena, yes.

16:02.823 --> 16:04.525
Yeah, well, I think I have to know...

16:05.703 --> 16:12.833
really just to demonstrate how generous he has been to indicate the scope of the gifts.

16:13.053 --> 16:16.898
Well, there are so many all over the country.

16:17.279 --> 16:23.627
Every once in a while I hear about some place that I never knew that he had any particular interest.

16:23.647 --> 16:25.389
And Elizabeth Speer would have this?

16:25.890 --> 16:27.592
She could tell you that people would.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.954
And I'd just write her in care of?

16:30.136 --> 16:33.280
Well, you can see what is her post office box.

16:33.513 --> 16:39.299
Well, you can write her 409, the museum's box, and you'll get her.

16:40.360 --> 16:40.801
Okay.

16:40.821 --> 16:46.306
And she could tell you, because all sorts of people, now Colgate, for instance, he gave them things.

16:47.127 --> 16:49.390
And this is so.

16:49.450 --> 16:51.592
Canford, I think, gave things.

16:51.672 --> 16:53.474
As I say, the free library, he gave them.

16:53.494 --> 17:00.601
Well, I was told yesterday that Santa Clara was building a library, and he said, I will help you make a great library.

17:00.741 --> 17:02.203
And so he gave them something.

17:02.453 --> 17:04.215
Well, Santa Cruz.

17:04.395 --> 17:05.316
Santa Cruz, yes.

17:05.336 --> 17:06.057
Santa Cruz.

17:06.437 --> 17:18.990
Now, he gave his collection of, oh dear, who's the French Revolution?

17:19.150 --> 17:19.811
Carlisle.

17:20.051 --> 17:20.331
Oh, really?

17:20.392 --> 17:23.975
He gave his collection, which is a very notable collection of Carlisle.

17:24.216 --> 17:25.557
That went to Santa Cruz.

17:25.737 --> 17:29.541
Now, clearly, he built great collections.

17:29.892 --> 17:35.197
But he never became so attached to them that he felt he had to keep them.

17:35.418 --> 17:36.979
That's rather interesting.

17:37.560 --> 17:50.673
And, of course, having worked with book collectors all my life, I find it rather interesting that he's got what I would almost describe as a sort of a ruthless quality in collecting.

17:51.154 --> 17:55.057
Now, he would keep his, he could tell you every book he had.

17:55.918 --> 17:59.562
He could tell you when he bought it, where he bought it, what he paid for it.

17:59.997 --> 18:06.844
And he kept his inventory at a certain figure for the sake of insurance.

18:06.864 --> 18:14.052
And that meant that if he saw something that he wanted, he would give up something else.

18:14.112 --> 18:18.517
Now, most collectors, you know, they'd sooner give an arm or a leg.

18:18.938 --> 18:26.346
But there was one time I sold him the finest Nara book that I ever saw.

18:26.466 --> 18:27.447
Spell, please.

18:27.467 --> 18:28.468
N-A-R-A.

18:28.955 --> 18:35.730
They were beautiful Japanese manuscripts, beautifully illustrated, beautifully illuminated.

18:36.151 --> 18:47.537
This was a three-volume one, and we had a good many of them in Dawson's bookshop.

18:47.956 --> 18:50.058
I saw a good many of them.

18:50.078 --> 18:52.341
What was the figure that he had for inventory?

18:52.441 --> 18:53.442
I had no idea.

18:53.762 --> 18:54.763
I never asked him.

18:54.783 --> 18:56.325
I didn't want to know.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.169
I'm just surprised he didn't build a bigger library, you know.

19:00.189 --> 19:03.172
Do you think that maybe— Well, his library was in his home, you see.

19:03.772 --> 19:09.458
And this is something else again.

19:09.518 --> 19:10.640
This is the museum.

19:11.080 --> 19:15.104
There at his home, Scarifor, he had a 90-foot gallery there.

19:16.586 --> 19:17.727
That was where?

19:17.977 --> 19:19.639
That was here in St.

19:19.699 --> 19:20.239
Helena.

19:20.259 --> 19:21.881
A 90-foot gallery.

19:22.121 --> 19:23.523
A 90-foot book gallery.

19:23.663 --> 19:23.903
Wow.

19:24.524 --> 19:34.134
He built this house in 1970, and he said when he had it, he said, if I have it, he said, I've always wanted a big house.

19:34.314 --> 19:37.497
And he said, if I only have it for a year, I'll have had it.

19:37.517 --> 19:37.878
Really?

19:37.898 --> 19:43.664
And for about six years, he had it, and he and his wife just had a wonderful time.

19:44.024 --> 19:46.046
And then things started to fall to pieces.

19:46.467 --> 19:47.848
The last trip that they went,

19:48.301 --> 19:54.068
to Europe, I am convinced that he had a stroke then, and he was just miserable.

19:54.649 --> 20:00.397
And they cut their trip short ten days to come home, and when they phoned they were coming.

20:00.457 --> 20:06.765
I had to tell them that when they got home, they would find that sixty-five acres of their property was burned over.

20:06.785 --> 20:10.049
No buildings, fortunately, taken over.

20:10.069 --> 20:10.289
Sixty-five?

20:10.309 --> 20:11.391
How large is the property?

20:12.532 --> 20:13.474
Oh, I can't tell you.

20:13.614 --> 20:16.958
It was how many acres he had.

20:17.123 --> 20:22.472
Oh, he was always buying things, yes.

20:22.492 --> 20:23.594
He was picking up things.

20:24.094 --> 20:28.842
And then, you see, he paid for all of the things that we got as well.

20:29.143 --> 20:34.932
But after that, Charlotte said, coming back, that he was confused.

20:35.012 --> 20:39.199
And she'd say, you know, now you stay right here with the luggage.

20:39.259 --> 20:41.463
Don't you move and I'll get somebody to help you.

20:42.024 --> 20:43.907
And that's the way they got home.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.685
And she was busy coaching him for a while.

20:46.785 --> 20:48.528
Every once in a while, he'd be confused.

20:49.008 --> 20:55.937
All of a sudden, she had a stroke that put her in bed in a wheelchair, took away her speech, left her mind.

20:56.038 --> 20:58.000
She could tell what was going on.

20:58.441 --> 21:01.905
And he says he looks at her painting out there.

21:01.925 --> 21:06.912
He says he'll never forget the pleading way that she'd look at him, trying to get him to understand.

21:06.952 --> 21:08.474
So she died in 82.

21:08.674 --> 21:11.498
And how old is Mr. Stroess now?

21:11.917 --> 21:15.844
He will be 84 in November.

21:16.766 --> 21:17.828
And he moved out here?

21:18.129 --> 21:21.395
I mean, he obviously must have lived in New York all these years.

21:21.415 --> 21:24.160
Well, he lived in New York for about 15 years.

21:24.961 --> 21:26.424
Just 15 years?

21:26.444 --> 21:26.664
Yeah.

21:26.704 --> 21:27.486
He was out here.

21:27.786 --> 21:35.140
Well, he was here on the West Coast, and then he was in Detroit when he moved into the presidency.

21:35.272 --> 21:36.716
Where is he from?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.303
He's from Olympia, Washington.

21:40.205 --> 21:48.387
When I was coming out here, one of the people there at the New York Public Library, she said,

21:48.603 --> 21:51.287
Oh, she said, you're going to have a dream employer.

21:51.347 --> 21:54.932
She said, he's so warm-hearted and cordial for a New Yorker.

21:54.952 --> 21:57.695
I said, I can tell you the answer to that, he isn't a New Yorker.

21:57.735 --> 21:58.356
That's the reason.

21:58.617 --> 22:03.483
But you said he was ruthless, ruthless in the sense of getting what he wanted.

22:03.643 --> 22:05.746
Well, no, I mean in collecting.

22:06.227 --> 22:10.813
If he saw something, he would sell something else.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.195
And that's what happened to the Nara book.

22:13.215 --> 22:15.698
I asked, you know, one time I asked about it.

22:15.718 --> 22:25.090
He never said anything, but later I found out that there was a manuscript David McGee had, and he decided he wanted that, so away went the Nara book.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.171
He sold or he gave?

22:26.632 --> 22:27.653
Did he do both?

22:27.794 --> 22:29.195
Well, both.

22:29.335 --> 22:32.560
In this instance, he was trading with a dealer.

22:33.561 --> 22:33.681
I see.

22:33.701 --> 22:36.324
And that was the way that he managed.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.387
He clearly believes, though, that

22:39.262 --> 22:50.092
many of the collections that he has formed belong in institutions and should not go back into the private collecting sector, shall we say?

22:50.633 --> 22:52.795
That's kind of unusual.

22:53.035 --> 23:08.610
Yes, he's given, but as I say, the collections, his big collections that he's given, you'll find mostly in the Bancroft and Gleason and Santa Cruz.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.220
to Mr. Strauss and his late wife.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.222
Did they have any children?

23:12.402 --> 23:13.884
Did they have a family?

23:13.904 --> 23:15.085
She had three children.

23:15.987 --> 23:21.434
She was a widow when he married her, and he is very devoted to his stepchildren.

23:21.454 --> 23:26.621
He adopted them all legally, and they come around to see him.

23:27.442 --> 23:33.490
One of them is in Connecticut.

23:33.750 --> 23:38.817
She was the editor of the American Kennel Gazette,

23:39.185 --> 23:45.873
She judges dog shows, and she's a very competent editor.

23:45.893 --> 23:51.801
The middle one is Stanley Holt, whose headquarters are in Tokyo.

23:52.722 --> 23:59.250
And then the youngest one is a daughter, and I think their headquarters are in St.

23:59.330 --> 23:59.971
Louis now.

23:59.991 --> 24:05.918
Her husband has a big automobile agency that covers, I think, several states.

24:06.387 --> 24:07.428
And they come and go.

24:07.468 --> 24:08.809
They come and visit him.

24:08.829 --> 24:15.936
Now, the passion for Steve Stevenson is the one collection he decided to keep, not for himself, but in his own museum.

24:16.356 --> 24:16.857
Well, yes.

24:16.897 --> 24:22.342
Well, of course, the other collections are being kept also, the ones that... And now some of them he sells.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.885
I think most of his incanabula, for instance, were sold.

24:26.225 --> 24:27.647
And incanabula, too?

24:27.667 --> 24:28.127
Oh, yes.

24:28.848 --> 24:34.673
And one of the things, interestingly enough, that he just loves, and I think he still has it,

24:35.142 --> 24:37.024
is Thomas Bird Molger.

24:37.585 --> 24:39.728
He just loves those.

24:39.748 --> 24:45.976
And another thing that he is still hanging onto are fine bindings, modern fine bindings.

24:45.996 --> 25:04.980
He likes, for instance, to get the sheets from some book that appeals to him, get six copies, give the six sheets to six different binders, and tell them to do just whatever the book says to them.

25:05.568 --> 25:13.195
And he will, I've had exhibits here showing six copies of the same book.

25:13.496 --> 25:15.778
Could you think of a title offhand?

25:15.858 --> 25:21.464
And it's not necessary, but you could just think of something where he might have done that.

25:21.584 --> 25:25.628
It's kind of interesting.

25:25.648 --> 25:29.451
Oh, it's... It's not necessary.

25:29.471 --> 25:30.352
I should know him.

25:30.452 --> 25:35.237
I should remember him.

25:35.453 --> 25:37.615
The Silverado Journal was one.

25:37.655 --> 25:40.158
The Silverado Episode, which he did himself.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.982
The Child's Garden of Verses.

25:45.884 --> 25:47.165
The Passion of Pirates.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.968
Now that, you see, is on Thomas Byrd Mulcher.

25:50.788 --> 25:52.310
Very, very fond of him.

25:53.131 --> 25:59.597
One World of Sam Meek.

25:59.918 --> 26:03.061
That was another one.

26:03.762 --> 26:04.262
That's funny.

26:04.512 --> 26:12.824
That he had, now you can see here, the different binders that he had.

26:12.844 --> 26:17.591
They came from England, Germany, Belgium.

26:18.773 --> 26:20.576
His wife was a binder for a time.

26:20.596 --> 26:24.321
This was an exhibit of contemporary commissioned bindings, if it so was.

26:24.361 --> 26:24.582
Exactly.

26:24.602 --> 26:26.945
Now, that came out in 81.

26:27.165 --> 26:29.108
I put on that exhibit then.

26:29.489 --> 26:33.675
But he still, I think, is keeping his binders.

26:33.976 --> 26:37.241
Does he come in here often?

26:37.261 --> 26:39.384
He used to, but he doesn't now very much.

26:39.444 --> 26:49.519
Now I'll get after him pretty soon and say, I've got a new exhibit of the Treasure Island, and the nurse will bring him down.

26:49.539 --> 26:57.251
Often they see the chance to go shopping at the grocery store, and they park him, you see, and we can show him a few things.

26:58.573 --> 27:02.599
When we went down to the Bancroft Library a while ago, we had

27:02.967 --> 27:05.290
I guess you knew that Jim Hart?

27:05.310 --> 27:08.796
I did, yes.

27:10.839 --> 27:12.120
This is what he was here.

27:12.160 --> 27:16.467
A brilliant mind, I'm told.

27:16.487 --> 27:19.531
Oh, there he is.

27:19.631 --> 27:22.315
Is this Mr. Strauss down here?

27:22.335 --> 27:24.639
Yes, that's Norman.

27:24.659 --> 27:27.543
Here's a very good photograph of him here.

27:27.563 --> 27:32.350
And here's Jim Hart, and this is Jim Hart also.

27:34.068 --> 27:43.140
And we wanted, as I say, we went down there and had lunch.

27:43.680 --> 27:52.552
And right there in the rare book department of the Bancroft Library and Jim Hart had gotten the best box lunch I ever had.

27:52.592 --> 27:53.653
It was just delicious.

27:54.154 --> 28:01.223
And they trotted out the things that they had bought recently with the money that Norman had given them.

28:01.574 --> 28:26.147
and the nurse was keeping an eye on things we stayed there just about an hour but he actually climbed upstairs there is a room there that that is the norman and charlotte strauss room and well should be because it's full of the things that he has given you spent and i really won't check up too much well it's all right you don't i don't have any date right now so you're all right but you spent your life

28:26.870 --> 28:29.272
you're observing book people.

28:29.632 --> 28:38.480
Do you have any idea what it is that drives people to become so passionate about the acquisition of books?

28:38.500 --> 28:41.883
Well, possession, I think.

28:42.263 --> 28:49.630
Now, there are some people that are just as ardent in collecting.

28:49.710 --> 28:52.452
I used to be interested there at Dawson's, you know.

28:52.472 --> 28:55.295
They'd say, well, poor so-and-so is gone.

28:55.435 --> 28:56.556
I guess it

28:56.772 --> 28:59.956
It comes to all of us, and we'll miss one of them.

28:59.976 --> 29:05.863
Do you know what's going on in Duke's books?

29:05.903 --> 29:07.545
That happened over and over again.

29:07.565 --> 29:09.247
I think it probably continues to happen.

29:09.567 --> 29:18.457
But somebody asked me to write a little article about Arthur Rackham and what I knew about him.

29:18.497 --> 29:25.986
And there at Gossens, we found out that we had two collectors, two women, that were

29:26.320 --> 29:32.866
ardently collecting Rackham, and they were bewailing the fact that there was no bibliography.

29:32.926 --> 29:37.170
Well, we introduced the two of them and said, why don't you do it?

29:37.871 --> 29:42.775
And that was how the Latimer-Haskell bibliography came into existence.

29:42.795 --> 29:46.259
These are two women named Latimer and Haskell?

29:46.299 --> 29:50.142
Sarah Briggs Latimer and Grace Clark Haskell.

29:51.844 --> 29:53.205
Grace?

29:53.489 --> 29:55.852
Haskell, H-A-S-K-E-L-L.

29:56.032 --> 30:01.820
Well, what's really good is because so many, you hear this myth that women don't collect, you know.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.541
Oh, they did.

30:02.581 --> 30:06.767
There was Mrs. Taylor there in Colorado Springs.

30:06.787 --> 30:11.133
I think she had, oh, I think she had all four fullies of Shakespeare.

30:11.153 --> 30:12.114
I'm not sure.

30:12.134 --> 30:12.274
Really?

30:12.507 --> 30:13.609
But I knew her.

30:13.649 --> 30:18.297
She used to come into Dawson's, and she'd say, this is Miss Schaefer.

30:18.537 --> 30:21.062
Miss Schaefer is a native of Leadville.

30:21.082 --> 30:24.568
I have to laugh every time I think of anybody from Leadville.

30:24.828 --> 30:27.232
Well, they weren't so stupid in the mining camp.

30:27.252 --> 30:29.115
You know, in a mining camp, you get everybody.

30:29.977 --> 30:34.184
But anyway, these two women, we introduced them to each other.

30:34.224 --> 30:35.967
That's a great story.

30:36.149 --> 30:37.812
They were simply wonderful.

30:37.872 --> 30:41.598
You never saw two people that worked together as happily as they did.

30:41.959 --> 30:46.106
Here they were, each collecting, and they would defer to each other.

30:46.126 --> 30:47.849
I never saw anything like it.

30:47.869 --> 30:50.493
They were just dream people to work with.

30:50.533 --> 30:53.879
We never had any problem about them.

30:53.899 --> 30:59.068
We'd say, well, here's such and such that's just come in, and they would decide which one would take it.

30:59.572 --> 31:04.179
Was that one of the publications from Dawson's bookstore, did they send?

31:04.199 --> 31:04.920
No, they didn't.

31:04.940 --> 31:06.402
It was Sutton House that did it.

31:06.903 --> 31:13.572
And poor Sally and Mrs. Haskell, as far as I know, didn't get one penny out of all of their work.

31:14.554 --> 31:16.457
Sutton House is English, I think, right?

31:16.837 --> 31:20.563
No, he was an American.

31:20.643 --> 31:21.264
Really?

31:21.504 --> 31:22.245
Oh, yes.

31:22.265 --> 31:25.510
Now, this was 1936 that this happened.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.414
Were these affluent women?

31:28.951 --> 31:29.953
Did you say?

31:29.973 --> 31:30.294
No.

31:30.574 --> 31:42.657
And, of course, in those days, you know, money went farther, and they both were well-to-do, and they collected and made this wonderful, which

31:43.092 --> 31:45.056
It has been in three editions now.

31:45.076 --> 31:46.640
The latest edition is 87.

31:46.820 --> 31:49.626
And they were both Los Angeles area women?

31:49.726 --> 31:53.915
One was Los Angeles and the other was Al Jadino, which of course is close.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.082
But they were collecting independently and didn't know of each other's existence?

31:57.102 --> 31:59.106
To start with until we introduced them.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.369
And this was the Ed Dawson's?

32:00.469 --> 32:01.050
Ed Dawson.

32:01.638 --> 32:05.822
And as I say, I never saw two such people that worked so well.

32:06.002 --> 32:13.848
And Mrs. Haskell decided that she would defer to Sally Latimer so that her name came first on the title page.

32:14.809 --> 32:19.073
And the two of them built up wonderful collections.

32:19.914 --> 32:31.003
And back about 1958, Mrs. Haskell, by that time I was in Philadelphia, she decided to

32:31.355 --> 32:38.867
sell her collection, and so I bought the collection for Philadelphia, for the Free Library of Philadelphia.

32:39.228 --> 32:48.724
So it came back, assembled on the west coast, came back to the east coast, and Sally sold her collection to Columbia.

32:50.146 --> 32:51.809
Wonderful story.

32:51.829 --> 32:57.919
And so they both came back, and later Rackham's daughter came over,

32:58.304 --> 33:00.547
and saw both of the collections.

33:00.808 --> 33:10.501
When she came down to Philadelphia, we had an enlarged portrait of her father that we had up on the pillar, and she said, so wonderful to come in.

33:10.582 --> 33:13.626
And here he was, just the way she remembered him.

33:13.946 --> 33:16.871
If you worked at Josh's, did you know the Countess at all?

33:16.931 --> 33:22.118
Did you ever have any dealings with Doheny, the Countess Doheny?

33:22.638 --> 33:23.779
I certainly did.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.321
Is there anything you can share about her?

33:26.341 --> 33:26.962
Wonderful.

33:27.062 --> 33:28.583
She was a wonderful person.

33:28.623 --> 33:30.685
Yes, I used to have lunch with her.

33:31.726 --> 33:41.794
And they gave a lunch for me before I decided I'd cash in on my GI Bill of Rights and go down to Mexico and study for a while.

33:42.495 --> 33:46.639
And so she gave a letter, she gave a luncheon for me.

33:47.039 --> 33:51.683
And there was a lovely big card at each table in an envelope.

33:52.186 --> 33:55.691
a wonderful handkerchief in it, and a card.

33:56.331 --> 34:01.999
And as I started to open it, Lucille Miller, her librarian, said, that's quiet, that's private.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.183
So I waited until I was alone and opened it.

34:05.664 --> 34:07.506
Here is a check for $100.

34:08.027 --> 34:14.856
It said that each month that you are in Mexico, you will get one of these checks, and I'll pray for you, too.

34:15.757 --> 34:18.801
That was the countess.

34:19.203 --> 34:23.809
And she didn't take the Countess so seriously after she was maiden.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.632
It was the first papal Countess in the United States.

34:26.652 --> 34:31.158
Somebody called up and said, well, how should we address it?

34:31.178 --> 34:32.459
Well, by Mrs. Doheny, of course.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.805
I wish she had wonderful taste in books, didn't she?

34:36.825 --> 34:37.966
She was marvelous.

34:38.106 --> 34:43.172
And, of course, a lot of people used to get the sneering here and there, you know, with just money.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.175
Well, they found out now.

34:45.575 --> 34:48.619
Well... With her...

34:49.038 --> 34:50.640
And did she ever know them?

34:50.861 --> 34:57.931
You see, she said that nothing was to be done to her books until she had been dead for 25 years.

34:58.552 --> 35:06.104
Well, when the archbishop found out that it was appraised of 20 million, you can imagine how happy he was.

35:07.005 --> 35:09.108
And they got busy right away.

35:09.529 --> 35:11.552
There were the seven auctions.

35:11.768 --> 35:15.514
And they got not 20 million, they got 41 million.

35:15.534 --> 35:17.016
No, I have the catalogs.

35:17.837 --> 35:18.559
They're right here.

35:20.682 --> 35:22.124
Did you know Bradley Martin at all?

35:22.885 --> 35:24.247
Yes, slightly.

35:24.568 --> 35:28.254
I didn't know him so well, but I'd see him at some of the meetings, yes.

35:28.414 --> 35:30.217
Yes, I didn't know him.

35:30.237 --> 35:38.029
You don't have to answer this question, but I'm so impressed by the breadth of experience that you've had.

35:38.465 --> 35:41.168
Do you mind telling me how old you are, if you don't want to?

35:41.188 --> 35:43.630
Well, I can't dodge it very well.

35:43.691 --> 35:50.398
A year ago, the museum put on a birthday party for me to celebrate my 85th birthday.

35:50.698 --> 35:54.202
I was 86 on the 24th of April.

35:54.222 --> 35:54.462
Wow.

35:54.482 --> 35:58.827
And how—is this a 40-hour job for you that you—?

35:59.147 --> 36:04.793
Well, it's four hours in the afternoon, and then, of course, there are always the extra times that

36:05.077 --> 36:11.466
that come here and there, and I am pretty much running it because Norman isn't able to.

36:11.486 --> 36:16.793
The trustees would do anything that I wanted, I think.

36:16.994 --> 36:22.561
The one person, you see, that I depended on so much who was the rare book specialist was Jim Hart.

36:22.601 --> 36:23.342
Jim was gone.

36:24.824 --> 36:33.376
And we felt that all of us were older, you know, and we wanted to get somebody a little bit younger.

36:33.456 --> 36:34.678
Well, there's this very

36:34.979 --> 36:36.200
energetic person.

36:36.240 --> 36:42.147
She did a very fine life of Fanny Stevenson, which unfortunately we've never been able to publish it.

36:42.827 --> 36:47.653
Eleanor McIntyre, as I say, younger than any of the rest of us in her fifties.

36:48.013 --> 36:49.635
She's the one that had cancer.

36:50.456 --> 36:53.919
She's gone.

36:54.480 --> 37:03.670
I'm so overwhelmed by all the information.

37:03.818 --> 37:04.919
Nice.

37:04.939 --> 37:06.441
Congratulations, really.

37:06.661 --> 37:07.802
You said GI Bill.

37:07.862 --> 37:08.663
Were you in the service?

37:09.164 --> 37:11.446
Yes, I was in the Air Corps for two years.

37:11.506 --> 37:13.709
I was in Dutch New Guinea in the Philippines.

37:14.390 --> 37:16.612
And that was a very interesting experience.

37:16.812 --> 37:19.275
And the Philippines when, during World War II?

37:19.295 --> 37:19.555
Yes.

37:19.996 --> 37:23.840
Yes, I was there at the time that the Japs folded up.

37:24.621 --> 37:27.504
What did you do?

37:27.524 --> 37:30.367
Well, they called it shipment control.

37:30.527 --> 37:31.969
What I did was keeping track of

37:32.320 --> 37:37.907
of radar and radio communication that came into the theater.

37:38.007 --> 37:54.349
I worked with the manifest of cargo planes and ships, and I kept records of what material we had coming into the theater, and it was the case of just needing to be accurate.

37:54.950 --> 37:59.796
There'd be an SCR-620, and that would be a ground radar set.

37:59.962 --> 38:08.876
And then there'd be something else with just as many letters and numbers, and those would be resistors, probably, something like that.

38:08.956 --> 38:15.626
It's just so remarkable, this gentleman is just, I mean, he's just so wonderful.

38:15.646 --> 38:16.648
Oh, Norman?

38:16.668 --> 38:23.819
Well, he is a wonderful person, and I've been sort of an extension of the family.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.543
They celebrated their, I think it was their

38:27.147 --> 38:37.239
31st wedding anniversary, and Pat, the oldest daughter, said, oh, I said, well, my family's been swingers from way back.

38:37.499 --> 38:41.884
They're celebrating their 31st wedding anniversary.

38:41.924 --> 38:44.427
Of course, I am 50 now.

38:48.592 --> 38:55.500
When they celebrated, I was the only person at the party that wasn't related by birth or marriage.

38:56.189 --> 39:00.294
I've been very, very lucky.

39:02.337 --> 39:05.961
He has been very, very good to me.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.185
He and Charlotte, I thought the world of him.

39:09.205 --> 39:11.949
They both were wonderful people.

39:13.130 --> 39:24.424
He's been very, very generous to people.

39:24.758 --> 39:42.654
And he decided that he would have this museum, and he had this one young man that was one of his students there at Santa Cruz who helped him start in, helped set up the university, I mean the museum.

39:43.415 --> 39:50.221
And he was his provisional curator for five weeks before the Army got him.

39:50.501 --> 39:52.163
That was Steve Correll.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.765
I don't know if he, or I mean Corrie.

39:55.572 --> 40:01.421
Well, he was the librarian of the Gleason Library.

40:01.561 --> 40:02.483
That's right.

40:02.503 --> 40:04.225
His father mentioned him yesterday.

40:04.265 --> 40:05.307
What did he say about him?

40:05.407 --> 40:06.409
Did he say how he lost?

40:07.110 --> 40:09.033
He didn't, but I remember him.

40:09.173 --> 40:18.667
He mentioned his name several times in the course of the discussion, with how they were getting their mandate to go out and build a library.

40:18.908 --> 40:20.690
Well, Steve has AIDS.

40:22.313 --> 40:22.373
Oh.

40:24.023 --> 40:25.506
I had heard that, as a matter of fact.

40:25.526 --> 40:26.067
Had you?

40:26.087 --> 40:26.728
Yeah.

40:26.748 --> 40:28.672
Well, I saw him.

40:28.732 --> 40:34.844
I was just simply horrified to, to... Did you see the tall fellow there?

40:34.864 --> 40:36.868
The very tall young mustache?

40:36.888 --> 40:37.710
Yes, he had.

40:39.313 --> 40:40.375
They took this picture.

40:40.475 --> 40:45.525
You can see where things are starting there, you see.

40:47.108 --> 40:48.630
I heard he's really quite a whiz.

40:49.331 --> 40:51.354
I mean, he's a terrific book man.

40:51.614 --> 40:54.097
Well, he was a worker.

40:54.117 --> 40:56.841
Now, this is the way he looked 20 years ago.

40:56.861 --> 41:00.486
And let's see, this is 1983.

41:00.666 --> 41:07.335
I was horrified when I went to the Gleason Library dinner.

41:07.415 --> 41:15.546
I thought he looked just terrible, and I didn't see how he could look any worse, and then I saw him at the memorial service for

41:15.779 --> 41:18.202
Jim Hart, and he looked infinitely worse.

41:18.262 --> 41:23.850
And I think the poor thing just goes crawling over the library.

41:24.711 --> 41:28.756
Father Bill says everybody there is very supportive of him.

41:29.737 --> 41:30.779
One final question.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.341
What's your dog's name, by the way?

41:32.361 --> 41:33.242
Oh, that is Stevie.

41:33.603 --> 41:33.963
Stevie.

41:33.983 --> 41:36.246
Stevie is the third assistant curator.

41:36.266 --> 41:37.868
And Stevie is what kind of dog?

41:39.130 --> 41:41.533
I think mostly Lhasa Apso.

41:42.188 --> 41:44.150
I don't know.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.313
Well, the vet was showing me.

41:46.333 --> 41:52.039
They said that for 700 years they were trained as watchdogs for the Tibetan nobles.

41:52.139 --> 41:54.822
I said, well, we're a little bit short on Tibetan nobles.

41:54.863 --> 41:55.023
Stevie.

41:55.043 --> 41:56.524
Oh, Stevie.

41:59.248 --> 42:00.269
Nice dog.

42:00.889 --> 42:02.571
He's got a beautiful baby.

42:02.591 --> 42:03.833
Very, very sweet.

42:04.053 --> 42:07.157
Just, I guess, one last question and then we'll leave you.

42:07.757 --> 42:10.120
Just an evaluation of

42:10.555 --> 42:16.583
I guess I'd just like a final comment on Mr. Strauss as a bookman.

42:16.623 --> 42:19.086
What separates him from the other book people you've known?

42:20.408 --> 42:22.150
Well, persistence.

42:22.170 --> 42:30.361
And as I say, any time he reads anything, at least it used to be that way, it was something that was informative that would help.

42:30.922 --> 42:35.308
He just has, I guess, this thirst for education.

42:36.109 --> 42:40.174
And he has bought...

42:40.762 --> 42:45.307
according to his interests.

42:45.868 --> 42:56.099
And his interests, as I say, he started out with Thomas Byrd Mulder, and then he picked up a good collection in Cannabula.

42:56.640 --> 43:06.651
He had a very nice collection of illuminated manuscripts, and every Christmas time we would put in an exhibit

43:06.800 --> 43:08.602
We'd forget about Stevenson.

43:08.622 --> 43:11.765
We'd put in an exhibit of illuminated manuscripts.

43:12.546 --> 43:23.418
And the last few years, each time I would be having a desperate time, I would pick up a few of the things that I had collected myself at Dawson's.

43:24.099 --> 43:29.685
But it used to be that I would borrow about eighteen items from them.

43:29.705 --> 43:33.229
The last time it was five items.

43:33.479 --> 43:39.306
And, of course, it used to be that every time Jim Hart came up, something always stuck to him.

43:41.709 --> 43:51.481
He was a widower for a number of years, and then he married a very charming woman who was a trustee of the Bancroft, and they came up here.

43:51.561 --> 43:56.247
I never saw two happier people in my life.

43:56.547 --> 43:58.109
He came up for something.

43:58.190 --> 43:59.952
I said, well, did Connie come with him?

44:00.173 --> 44:02.056
He said, oh, no, there wasn't room.

44:03.518 --> 44:09.247
I said, I had pictures of him departing with maybe an Egyptian papyrus sticking out of the car window.

44:09.568 --> 44:10.790
You said you collect.

44:11.491 --> 44:11.932
You're a collector.

44:11.952 --> 44:13.374
No, I don't collect anything.

44:13.414 --> 44:22.328
It was just, most of the things that I use to piece out here are individual leaves, you know, manuscript leaves.

44:22.348 --> 44:23.550
You see, I used to teach.

44:23.783 --> 44:39.537
the history of books and printing I taught at Columbia, and I had taught for the extension of the University of California, and Immaculate Heart, and my old library school I taught that.

44:39.717 --> 44:52.288
So I had just little bits and pieces, you know, and I have one incannabulum, but I could bring that out to show it's in contemporary binding, I could show what that was like, and so I was just piecing out

44:52.589 --> 44:55.814
He was teaching aides, I gather, is what you're saying.

44:56.075 --> 44:57.838
Well, yes.

44:57.858 --> 45:11.360
And they were really more than teaching aides, I guess, but I just picked up everything that I could to piece out, and I don't know what I'll have this next Christmas.

45:11.861 --> 45:17.230
It's hard to say, but he had a wonderful collection.

45:17.547 --> 45:23.380
And more and more especially, he had two Ethiopian manuscripts.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.683
And they were marvelous.

45:24.743 --> 45:26.467
The color's just the same, you know.

45:27.148 --> 45:33.041
And I think any time anybody ever saw one of the Ethiopian manuscripts, they'd never forget it.

45:33.903 --> 45:36.990
And they went down to the Bancroft.

45:37.645 --> 45:41.851
There was a nice 13th century biblia that I loved dearly.

45:41.971 --> 45:43.693
Jim got that, too.

45:44.174 --> 45:44.775
Now what happens?

45:44.795 --> 45:50.563
Jim comes up and does he say to Mr. Strauss, gee, how does something like that happen, I wonder?

45:50.924 --> 45:54.669
Well, I have never been around when Jim was in action.

45:54.709 --> 45:58.875
But as I say, every time he'd go up there, something would stick to him.

45:58.935 --> 46:04.142
And there was one time he came up, and I called up Norman.

46:04.544 --> 46:06.566
Norman didn't feel like seeing him.

46:06.886 --> 46:16.696
And I about fainted, and I think Jim about fainted, because he never realized, I guess, that there'd ever be a time that Norman wouldn't see him.

46:16.716 --> 46:18.518
He just sounds like such a giving man.

46:18.538 --> 46:19.078
Well, he is.

46:19.118 --> 46:21.120
He can't say no to a good cause.

46:21.341 --> 46:27.467
Well, he never let his heart run away with his hand.

46:27.547 --> 46:30.990
He would figure that what he was giving was

46:31.274 --> 46:33.838
They're going to just the right place.

46:33.878 --> 46:44.035
And if he did, did he make stipulations that the libraries had to keep the collections together, or did he just give it and allow them to do with it?

46:44.636 --> 46:49.705
Does he stipulate that the materials can never be deaccessioned?

46:50.663 --> 46:52.346
I have no idea what he'd do.

46:52.426 --> 46:54.169
I've never heard that.

46:54.190 --> 46:55.913
That's kind of interesting, I wonder.

46:55.933 --> 46:59.780
You bet, for the time being, they won't be deaccessioned.

46:59.840 --> 47:00.161
I'm sure.

47:00.241 --> 47:10.059
And everybody at the memorial service for Jim Hart, more than one of the speakers mentioned these droughts.

47:10.079 --> 47:14.427
One of the things that he did for the Bancroft,

47:14.980 --> 47:20.448
or for the university was to establish a chair of, I presume, literature.

47:20.488 --> 47:23.012
I'm not quite sure, but it was for Jim Hart.

47:23.372 --> 47:27.438
It was an honor of Jim Hart, and Jim Hart... He's a philanthropist, really, isn't he?

47:27.458 --> 47:27.599
He is.

47:27.619 --> 47:28.139
With books.

47:28.921 --> 47:36.452
Well, do you think that there is a lot of... Does everyone know where the remaining, where the remainder of the library goes?

47:36.492 --> 47:44.143
Has that been... Are people still wondering whether or not they may get... Well, he has given away quite a bit of it.

47:44.967 --> 47:53.840
But I think he still has his ideas about some of the things that he is still keeping.

47:53.860 --> 47:58.646
But I'm sure others have their fingers crossed and their breath held.

47:59.808 --> 48:01.811
I don't know that they do so much.

48:01.891 --> 48:05.016
I think that they know that he knows pretty well where things are going.

48:05.036 --> 48:10.283
And of course, by and large, I would say the Bancroft, first of all.

48:10.634 --> 48:13.778
Gleeson and Santa Cruz, I think.

48:14.059 --> 48:16.582
But he has given things to other places.

48:16.662 --> 48:19.185
As I say, he gave to the Free Library of Philadelphia.

48:19.205 --> 48:19.886
You mentioned Cordell.

48:19.966 --> 48:29.619
And then, to show you the sort of person he is, he gave the presidential letters, and he gave money to continue to buy.

48:30.220 --> 48:32.303
Which presidential letters were these?

48:32.323 --> 48:34.425
They had letters from many presidents?

48:34.445 --> 48:34.966
Well, yes.

48:35.547 --> 48:37.249
The presidents of the United States.

48:37.837 --> 48:44.263
Starting in with George Washington and coming down to Richard Nixon.

48:44.463 --> 48:45.645
And he gave these to whom?

48:45.685 --> 48:49.188
He gave it to the Free Library, to the Rare Book Department of the Free Library.

48:49.528 --> 49:04.043
And as I say, gave money to continue more, which is something, when you're on the receiving end, you get a collection and you keep wishing to heaven that they give you a little to keep it up.

49:04.523 --> 49:05.464
But Norman did.

49:05.832 --> 49:10.938
Have there been any books or articles written about him that I could make reference to that you could think of?

49:10.958 --> 49:11.539
Norman?

49:11.559 --> 49:11.739
Yes.

49:12.740 --> 49:27.579
There was a, I guess you'd call it a book, it was a typescript, that J. Walter Thompson did at the time of his retirement.

49:27.599 --> 49:30.242
I wonder if I could get a copy of that from J. Walter Thompson.

49:30.262 --> 49:31.083
Well, I'd try.

49:31.103 --> 49:32.785
I have a copy of it.

49:33.018 --> 49:36.202
If I can't, is this something I could arrange to Xerox, do you think?

49:37.764 --> 49:39.166
I'll try J. Walter Thompson.

49:39.246 --> 49:41.409
Try J. Walter Thompson.

49:41.429 --> 49:42.050
I'm sure.

49:42.070 --> 49:46.416
And it's a series of articles written by various people.

49:46.977 --> 49:53.846
He had Ducheness, who was in the East, and he had me in the West.

49:54.707 --> 50:00.375
And various people knew him as just starting out.

50:00.963 --> 50:06.011
And it was a very—it gave you all sorts of ideas.

50:06.031 --> 50:09.757
I'll go to work on that Monday morning, and if I can't get it, I'll call you back, okay?

50:09.777 --> 50:11.901
Maybe you could get a Xerox or something.

50:11.921 --> 50:17.189
Well, I found—and strangely enough, he never paid any attention to that, as far as I know.

50:17.209 --> 50:19.433
No, I never heard him mention it.

50:19.754 --> 50:26.785
And another thing that's always interested me is that I never hear anything about his advertising career.

50:27.052 --> 50:31.619
You'd think, you know, that you'd hear him mention experiences and so on.

50:31.919 --> 50:38.329
Maybe once in a long while something, but in general, that's just, that was one phase of his life.

50:38.489 --> 50:40.993
The books you think were number one in his life?

50:41.033 --> 50:42.475
Outside of the family, of course.

50:42.535 --> 50:47.543
Well, I think, I think that the, the books were really the major.

50:47.563 --> 50:56.316
And as I say, he collected, for instance, he, he collected satin glass, and he collected, uh, Amari, uh,

50:57.106 --> 51:04.094
China and so on.

51:04.155 --> 51:05.056
He was a collector.

51:05.096 --> 51:09.301
He just collected anything that appealed to him.

51:09.341 --> 51:09.862
Fine arts?

51:10.863 --> 51:14.747
Yes, and he was very much interested in modern art.

51:14.828 --> 51:20.815
He got quite a lot of art that he had there at J. Walter Thompson.

51:20.935 --> 51:25.521
I think he's got a Picasso there.

51:25.701 --> 51:26.742
What else has he got?

51:27.548 --> 51:29.610
Does he have a name for the house he lives in?

51:30.611 --> 51:31.732
He hasn't named this one.

51:31.752 --> 51:40.760
Now, the one he wanted to get the site that he wanted, so he bought Glass Mountain.

51:40.780 --> 51:42.001
He bought a whole mountain?

51:42.021 --> 51:48.547
He bought Glass Mountain, so-called because of the obsidian that's there.

51:48.907 --> 51:54.973
It was a source of arrows for the Indians, so he bought Glass Mountain.

51:55.291 --> 52:00.236
Because he wanted the site that was at the top of the mountain.

52:00.576 --> 52:03.399
And he named it S-K-E-R-R-Y-V-O-R-E.

52:03.959 --> 52:17.833
That was the name of a famous lighthouse that Stevenson's ancestors put up.

52:17.913 --> 52:21.957
It was on the north coast of Scotland.

52:22.375 --> 52:30.768
When Stevenson had a home, the first home that he and Fanny had in Bournemouth, they named that Scary Four.

52:31.489 --> 52:35.635
And poor Scary Four got bombed off the map in the Second World War.

52:35.935 --> 52:38.219
But he has this as Scary Four.

52:38.539 --> 52:44.248
The match folders used to have the name Scary Four on it.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.562
And he just loved that.

52:46.862 --> 52:52.669
But the house that he's got now is a pleasant house, but he's never, never given it a name.

52:52.829 --> 53:00.217
I think we were—I think he was waiting for us to make various suggestions and see what appealed to him.

53:00.237 --> 53:01.899
Did he sell Scary War?

53:02.099 --> 53:09.006
He sold Scary War, and Scary War was bought by the Trine Carrels, who are Southern Home.

53:09.887 --> 53:11.289
Very interesting young couple.

53:11.349 --> 53:14.252
I think they married when they were nineteen.

53:14.384 --> 53:18.750
They started, and White Zinfandel was what set them on.

53:21.153 --> 53:26.000
I had some of the photographs.

53:26.060 --> 53:32.088
He sent down a lot of photographs that were around when they were moving down.

53:32.589 --> 53:35.873
And so I asked Mrs. Trimcaro if she would like to have them.

53:35.934 --> 53:36.635
She came up.

53:36.715 --> 53:43.564
I was sort of hoping she'd invite me to come up and see the house, although in a way I think maybe I don't want to see it.

53:44.202 --> 53:47.147
Because I know it's totally, totally different.

53:47.447 --> 53:54.799
But the one nice thing about it was that for about six years, they had a whale of a good time, and he just loved the house.

53:55.140 --> 53:58.064
It was a great, great big house.

53:58.225 --> 54:07.780
And as I say, the book gallery was 90 feet long, and there was a great big master bedroom, and then a guest room.

54:08.232 --> 54:14.819
and a great big dining room, and just one extra bedroom.

54:14.839 --> 54:15.880
They were smart.

54:15.900 --> 54:27.131
You know, out here we find that we have friends and relatives that we haven't heard of for 20 and 30 years, and they suddenly are seized with a desire to visit us.

54:27.611 --> 54:29.293
That's wonderful.

54:29.333 --> 54:31.535
I think we're going to let this... I'll see.

54:31.555 --> 54:34.899
There are a couple more pictures of Norman, I think.

54:34.959 --> 54:36.400
Sweetie, sweetie, thank you.

54:37.021 --> 54:39.684
We're talking now, but you might just tell us who you're talking about.

54:39.704 --> 54:40.925
Oh, about Mike Curling.

54:41.265 --> 54:43.908
Well, he was a postal clerk.

54:43.948 --> 54:52.075
He worked there at the post office, and during the Depression, you see, he had a steady job, and he was able to buy books.

54:52.996 --> 54:57.461
He used to pay us partly in stamps.

54:57.941 --> 55:05.188
The shipping clerk would tell him what denominations we wanted, and he just

55:05.540 --> 55:07.142
bought things and bought things.

55:07.662 --> 55:11.046
And I remember there was one poor customer that came out.

55:11.086 --> 55:13.328
He was very, very ill.

55:13.388 --> 55:20.857
He had a lot of books that we had put up on the shelves that we were going to send back to Gloversville, New York, where he came from.

55:20.897 --> 55:27.143
And one of the books that he bought, I think, was the Keats.

55:27.163 --> 55:32.009
Mike was absolutely livid when he found out, because he had wanted that book.

55:32.449 --> 55:35.192
He said he hoped he'd die.

55:35.560 --> 55:36.421
The man did.

55:37.162 --> 55:37.943
He said that.

55:38.104 --> 55:38.865
He said that.

55:38.925 --> 55:39.726
He said that.

55:40.707 --> 55:54.647
And when the lawyers released all of these books, as I say, we had them up on the tops of some of our bookcases there, Mike climbed right up.

55:54.747 --> 55:57.270
I said, I should think that book would burn your hands.

55:58.132 --> 56:00.575
But he wanted, and as I say, he meant it.

56:01.576 --> 56:04.200
And he would buy books from us.

56:04.535 --> 56:05.817
They would be wrapped up.

56:05.917 --> 56:11.266
I think a lot of them were wrapped up when the Dawson's got them later.

56:11.707 --> 56:17.115
And then, instead of using them, he wasn't going to wear out his good books.

56:17.376 --> 56:19.419
He'd go to the library to read the books.

56:20.601 --> 56:20.941
That's amazing.

56:20.961 --> 56:23.245
What gets me is he made no provision for his collection.

56:23.305 --> 56:26.290
He died and then it was just... Well, he was going to take it with him.

56:26.877 --> 56:33.304
And then after he died, Glenn found out that he had, I think, three sisters.

56:33.705 --> 56:35.066
This was news to us all.

56:35.086 --> 56:36.588
We never had heard about that.

56:36.628 --> 56:42.454
And one of them was, I think, an arrest, told them badly in need of money.

56:42.474 --> 56:46.098
And I think Glenn used to keep fighting the county of Los Angeles.

56:46.318 --> 56:50.243
You see, he'd made no provision, so the county stepped in and grabbed them.

56:50.303 --> 56:56.850
And then they found out that there were some heirs, only the poor heirs didn't have any chance to get them.

56:56.999 --> 56:57.680
at the time.

56:57.740 --> 57:00.943
What do you think possessed and drove this man?

57:02.124 --> 57:03.466
Well, there is a mania.

57:03.606 --> 57:07.510
There was a man like that in the 18th century.

57:07.570 --> 57:13.376
They nicknamed him Tom Folio, and he kept buying and buying just as Mike did.

57:13.716 --> 57:19.342
I think they said he finally was sleeping in the passageway because he'd filled up all of the books.

57:19.603 --> 57:21.004
This is the postal work?

57:21.284 --> 57:24.368
No, this was Tom Folio.

57:24.588 --> 57:25.969
Was he fictional or was he real?

57:26.029 --> 57:26.770
He was real.

57:27.222 --> 57:28.926
Just as Mike was real.

57:28.946 --> 57:32.113
I have to check this guy out, because I don't know about him.

57:32.133 --> 57:38.647
And I guess that it was just about impossible to get through his house that Mike had.

57:39.088 --> 57:44.640
But he used to come in, he used to be in the Dawson's, oh, at least once a week, actually.

57:44.941 --> 57:53.531
Glenn said he used to prefer to work nights and weekends so he could have the days to go to the bookstores and pay attention to his collection.

57:53.571 --> 57:54.773
That was it.

57:55.334 --> 57:59.739
That was the one thing that he... That's a great story.

58:00.880 --> 58:01.882
We're going to let you go, Ms.

58:01.922 --> 58:08.029
Frazier, and we can't thank you enough for everything.

58:08.245 --> 58:10.709
Well, I don't mind, you know, when people are interested.

58:11.230 --> 58:12.852
It's so important.

58:12.872 --> 58:17.219
I just couldn't imagine having Nick write a book without mention of this marvelous man.

58:17.239 --> 58:23.729
Well, as I say, he was a wonderful person, and he made all of his money himself.

58:24.209 --> 58:26.353
He's just a genius.

58:27.955 --> 58:31.941
I'd say perfect attention to detail.

58:32.427 --> 58:37.292
and a wonderful capacity for taking pains.

58:37.412 --> 58:40.094
I'll tell you that you're a wonderful person, too, though.

58:40.114 --> 58:43.157
In fact, do you mind if I take your picture over here?

58:43.177 --> 58:43.838
Would you object?

58:44.318 --> 58:51.826
Well, it's all over the place, and always wrapped up.

58:51.846 --> 58:54.648
He'd take them home, and then he wouldn't use them.

58:57.791 --> 59:01.675
They were being taken care of.

59:02.161 --> 59:04.705
So this is my dear woman.

59:05.746 --> 59:12.996
It is a pleasure that I send to you as a gift at the Robert Louis Stevenson desk, which stood in the library at V-A-I-L-I-N.

59:13.056 --> 59:14.859
Now that's by Lima, you see.

59:14.879 --> 59:17.682
That was Stevenson's home in Samoa.

59:17.923 --> 59:21.127
On the island of U-P-O-L-U, Samoa.

59:21.688 --> 59:26.835
I suggest that you paste this letter under the lid of the old desk as a certificate of authenticity.

59:27.490 --> 59:32.815
This piece of furniture has always had a peculiar interest for me as it played a large part in my lonely childhood.

59:33.696 --> 59:40.862
There were no other children in the Valima household so that I had to invent games for myself and furniture took on personalities.

59:40.883 --> 59:41.563
Isn't this wonderful?

59:42.324 --> 59:45.207
This desk stood in the library upstairs off Stevenson's study.

59:45.747 --> 59:56.417
Here in a dark room filled with books to the ceiling and piled in mountains all over the floor, I would play games during the rainy season when we would be driven indoors for days at a time.

59:56.853 --> 01:00:04.801
This old desk became my companion, and it was very useful for sometimes by child magic I made it a castle or a fort or a humble cottage.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:11.468
But my greatest achievement was making it the poop deck of the HMS Victory, Lord Nelson's flagship.

01:00:12.169 --> 01:00:21.999
I not only enacted the whole battle of Trafalgar, but I played all the parts, from the French admirals, snipers from the fighting tufts, wonderful, to Lord Nelson himself.

01:00:22.799 --> 01:00:26.303
I also played Captain Hardy, and I died most beautifully in my own arms.

01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:30.294
as I was both Nelson and Hardy.

01:00:31.575 --> 01:00:37.640
I was the lone actor of this great performance, except for Stevenson, who would glance in through the open door with an approving twinkle.

01:00:38.381 --> 01:00:44.747
I saw this desk when it first arrived with over 30 great packing cases lined with heavy zinc.

01:00:45.347 --> 01:00:56.357
We had to get the services of the A-R-M-C-U-R-E-R, arm curer of the H-M-S-C-U-R-A-C-O-A to bring his giant cutters

01:00:56.877 --> 01:01:08.353
The Kura Kasoa was stationed at APIA, A-P-I-A, for nine months, and the officers and midshipmen were considered a part of the Alima family.

01:01:09.275 --> 01:01:20.611
The packing cases were opened on the tennis courts in front of the big house, and our friends, the naval officers, were soon soiled and black in their white uniforms, a sight to behold as they lifted up busts.

01:01:20.991 --> 01:01:25.338
They were O'Don, Statouette, Sergeant, and Hogarths.

01:01:25.358 --> 01:01:25.618
Wow.

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:28.774
Silver and all the household effects of 17...
