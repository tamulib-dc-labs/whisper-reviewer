00:01.921 --> 00:11.342
Okay, I'm on here with Mr. John Maggs at Maggs Brothers at 50 Berkeley Square in England, and let's just pretend that's not there.

00:11.663 --> 00:14.910
Right, yes, for it ought to be there as an introduction.

00:14.930 --> 00:16.594
You were telling me about the formation of this.

00:17.496 --> 00:21.685
Yes, well, this is Masquerades, who I knew for quite a long time.

00:22.087 --> 00:48.887
He was buying books from my father and he's been dead 25 years old it's a long while ago, and he used to buy books from us books about Greece in the days when you could buy them quite readily. We had a room full of books about Greece in the days when my father was selling books to the king of Greece as well and who happens to be as well in London now that's being a police officer and he would come in

00:53.474 --> 01:20.157
used to be open and he could have the choice of anything he wanted and he was a delightful man as well which made it easier and so my father and he got on wanted to work together was he knowledgeable did he know he became more and more knowledgeable as time went on was he one of these collectors you do you think who bought books to for the pleasure of owning them for the pleasure but do you think he came to know them did

01:26.498 --> 01:28.801
was being a linguist.

01:28.821 --> 01:30.163
That's very important.

01:30.183 --> 01:36.352
With his background, so he was equally at home in, as far as I think, most European languages.

01:36.392 --> 01:42.040
When you say he looked like in Greek books, could we be a little more specific?

01:42.140 --> 01:45.504
Are we talking about really old books?

01:45.524 --> 01:54.096
When we say books about Greece, could we be a little more specific about what kinds of books?

01:54.156 --> 01:55.999
Well, because obviously a lot of it on the subject of Greek independence.

01:56.367 --> 02:03.855
But Greek altogether, that's the thing.

02:03.875 --> 02:04.536
Greek history.

02:04.676 --> 02:05.957
Not political.

02:11.383 --> 02:13.205
Yes.

02:13.946 --> 02:15.908
It wasn't a political collection, per se.

02:16.148 --> 02:17.089
No, it was travel.

02:17.309 --> 02:17.850
It was travel.

02:19.231 --> 02:21.214
Illustrated books, important authors.

02:21.334 --> 02:23.756
In the finest condition.

02:23.776 --> 02:24.417
That was the point.

02:25.156 --> 02:46.641
and then he liked to think that he was known as a great collector and he got this particular fascination with Troy and the history of Troy and so he formed an exhibition which went on

02:48.663 --> 02:49.684
in Bloomington.

02:49.704 --> 02:49.924
Really?

02:49.944 --> 02:51.385
So they must have a catalogue.

02:51.406 --> 02:54.388
And he helped with the catalogue.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.570
So I can get one of those.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.012
Yes, exactly.

02:58.052 --> 03:04.337
And obviously the idea was moving gradually that the Lilly Library would buy the whole library.

03:05.098 --> 03:07.420
But Lilly perhaps overplayed their credits a little bit.

03:07.440 --> 03:07.840
I think so.

03:07.861 --> 03:11.123
Well, they're not as... Possibly they haven't got as much money as they had.

03:12.345 --> 03:16.088
And they did, to be plain, they rather mess the widow about.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.379
He died very suddenly.

03:18.459 --> 03:26.386
He came in to tell me one day that he was dying of cancer.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.548
And so he had a year or so to wind up his affairs.

03:29.409 --> 03:39.138
But when he did die, there was the wife holding this library with two daughters of 20, 25, 30, that sort of thing.

03:39.158 --> 03:41.640
And that library was the principal asset.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.062
How would you judge it?

03:43.422 --> 03:45.364
Would you judge it as a preeminent library?

03:45.384 --> 03:46.665
Yes, very very much so.

03:47.017 --> 03:53.707
And then, of course, at the same time, Mr. Blackmer died as well, who also had a preeminent Greek library.

03:53.827 --> 03:57.673
And this gentleman's name is Mr. Blackmer.

03:58.073 --> 03:58.674
B-L-A-C-K-M-E-R.

03:58.874 --> 04:02.480
And he hired, no, he was American Greek, I don't know.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.721
But anyway, he was in Athens.

04:04.703 --> 04:11.353
And he hired a wonderful librarian to produce a catalogue of his library, which is out now, published by MAGS.

04:12.414 --> 04:14.998
A magnificent library catalogue, which we can sell you if you want.

04:16.666 --> 04:28.096
And that library went into Solvice and they had tremendous success in the way they handled it.

04:28.396 --> 04:33.020
They are absolute experts of how they will promote.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.402
They really are clever at it.

04:35.422 --> 04:41.367
And so what they did when the sale came up, plain loads of Greeks would come over.

04:41.987 --> 04:42.668
And Turks.

04:42.688 --> 04:46.251
And some of them, I wonder even sometimes if they knew

04:46.501 --> 04:49.004
what money they were bidding me.

04:49.024 --> 04:52.108
Well, Sotheby's does give you a status in seven pounds instead.

04:52.308 --> 04:52.809
Yes, I know.

04:52.829 --> 04:54.731
Well, that's a hype as well.

04:54.751 --> 04:59.858
But some of those prices will not be surpassed probably for quite some time.

04:59.878 --> 05:01.079
For Greek books?

05:01.119 --> 05:02.060
For books of acquisition.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.702
Now, why did Blackmer sell his collection?

05:04.043 --> 05:04.804
He was dead.

05:04.824 --> 05:05.324
Oh, he died?

05:05.425 --> 05:05.665
Yes.

05:05.765 --> 05:06.886
I'm sorry.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.528
Which is the usual reason.

05:08.649 --> 05:10.972
It sounded to me as if he were selling it.

05:11.292 --> 05:15.137
No, he had prepared, he got a librarian to prepare a monumental catalog.

05:15.237 --> 05:15.377
Uh-huh.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.784
in his lifetime.

05:17.904 --> 05:23.109
And you have a copy of that here which I can... Yes, which you can buy if you want.

05:23.129 --> 05:25.772
It's quite expensive anyway, but it is beautifully produced.

05:25.792 --> 05:32.558
But that's one of the, well, two of the great collections of just recent years.

05:32.578 --> 05:41.987
But the thing we like to say so often is that books should be bought for the love of the book and the collection rather than the future investment potential.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.790
Although they are a great thing for

05:45.783 --> 05:46.984
potentially perhaps for a widow.

05:49.226 --> 06:03.220
However, when you have a collection such as the Greek's collection, which is preeminent, and which is not likely to be replicated again, you almost would wish that it would stay again as a collection, wouldn't you?

06:03.240 --> 06:04.521
Well, hello, love.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.462
Please put your lunch.

06:05.482 --> 06:07.004
Oh, how nice.

06:07.024 --> 06:08.025
Another interview going on.

06:08.085 --> 06:10.567
I'm talking, I'm drooling on about Mr. Lascarides.

06:10.808 --> 06:11.328
Yeah.

06:12.109 --> 06:14.271
One of the nicest of names.

06:15.466 --> 06:18.129
Which is what I've got, too.

06:20.031 --> 06:24.095
When a loving wife brings in your sandwiches... Oh, look, there was a question for you.

06:24.135 --> 06:28.340
That was both... Gladys and Eileen.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.923
Neither can come to a meeting next week.

06:30.943 --> 06:31.984
You see, they're busy ladies.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.285
This is the trouble.

06:33.305 --> 06:38.831
And so, Christian, could Tim Waller come?

06:38.851 --> 06:41.254
It's a great thing to marry well.

06:42.331 --> 06:45.355
We're doing fine, by the way.

06:45.716 --> 06:47.478
That's just a letter of introduction.

06:47.498 --> 06:49.641
But what we're talking about is very useful to me.

06:50.322 --> 06:56.410
I would like at some point, I'd just like to finish with this Lascariti thing, because it's very interesting.

06:58.092 --> 07:04.120
One area I am exploring is institutional collecting, such as the Lilly Library.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.406
I've already spent four days at the University of Texas, for instance,

07:08.858 --> 07:11.601
That's why I really wanted to see Mr. Roder.

07:11.621 --> 07:12.742
This is 30 years ago.

07:12.762 --> 07:14.284
Who do you want to see?

07:14.705 --> 07:21.673
I was going to see Roder this morning, and he unexpectedly was called away.

07:21.693 --> 07:24.896
He had done even a lot of lecturing in Texas, too.

07:25.537 --> 07:27.599
Well, he was basically their British agent.

07:27.620 --> 07:28.981
I know, yes.

07:29.422 --> 07:31.624
Texas was a very unusual case.

07:31.724 --> 07:34.708
He was an extraordinary bookseller.

07:34.728 --> 07:35.669
Rudy Feldman.

07:36.009 --> 07:36.790
Rudy Feldman, yes.

07:37.462 --> 07:38.663
He's a focus.

07:38.683 --> 07:39.484
Did you know him at all?

07:39.504 --> 07:40.245
Very well, yes.

07:40.725 --> 07:42.847
What did you tell me about him?

07:42.867 --> 07:46.991
Why do you think, how do you think he became, I'm not going to be timid with you.

07:47.331 --> 07:48.272
He was no scholar.

07:48.292 --> 07:49.213
That was my viewpoint.

07:50.615 --> 07:55.900
How did he manage to become the exclusive agent for the University of Texas in the United States?

07:55.960 --> 07:59.783
You better be very careful because there's probably a lot of dirty washing there.

07:59.843 --> 08:02.086
I think I know some of it.

08:02.126 --> 08:05.269
Between him and, what was it, Ransom.

08:05.289 --> 08:06.710
Harry Ransom.

08:06.730 --> 08:06.810
Yes.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.826
really worked out oil well until it was nearly dry.

08:11.527 --> 08:14.950
But the result was that they may have paid too much at the time, but they got the books.

08:15.590 --> 08:22.237
I've been and seen these great roomfuls of books in that skyscraper.

08:22.277 --> 08:24.779
They bought far beyond their capacity to absorb them.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.223
But on the other hand, that's when the books were thick on the ground.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.025
And they bought them.

08:31.105 --> 08:34.688
The fact whether Ludy Feldman charged them too much for things is another matter.

08:35.208 --> 08:48.144
You don't think, and we can treat this confidentially as well, I mean, I wouldn't embarrass you, but you don't think there was any kind of hanky-panky going on between Feldman and you?

08:48.164 --> 08:49.065
Goodness knows.

08:49.085 --> 08:52.009
I have nothing to support them, by the way.

08:52.029 --> 08:55.974
I think that he was very comfortable working with them.

08:55.994 --> 09:00.119
Feldman was an unusual booksetter.

09:00.179 --> 09:02.201
He wasn't doing it the way we do.

09:02.222 --> 09:03.443
He did, for instance,

09:03.963 --> 09:07.546
Texas might have X amount of dollars to spend in a given year.

09:07.766 --> 09:09.288
Yeah, and you could use it.

09:09.848 --> 09:10.749
And it would be gone.

09:10.769 --> 09:13.331
Yes, exactly.

09:13.432 --> 09:15.774
But they would come across something that they would want.

09:15.874 --> 09:26.523
Feldman would buy it, charge them 10 percent per year, and the collection would then go to Texas, and it would take for two or three years down the road.

09:27.384 --> 09:30.026
Whether or not that's one other way of doing it, I don't know.

09:30.046 --> 09:33.970
It is an unorthodox way of doing it, and it's an interesting way of doing it.

09:34.270 --> 09:40.477
If you could do a lot of scholarly research on that, it would be quite useful.

09:41.078 --> 09:50.168
Because that was the biggest thing, 20 years ago, whenever it was the building up of that library in Texas.

09:50.188 --> 09:51.730
From about 1958 to 73.

09:51.890 --> 09:54.012
And now there's possibly no money at all.

09:54.133 --> 09:56.455
Well, the state is pretty shaky.

09:56.475 --> 10:00.840
Yeah, but the university is still, they still have money.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.522
It's like the bunker home story.

10:03.211 --> 10:06.735
Apparently, I was talking to Tom Staley just last month.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.721
He said he's going to have a big announcement he made.

10:10.741 --> 10:15.747
It sounds like he bought something that he wants to spend some dollars.

10:15.787 --> 10:22.415
They don't have the money that they had 15 years ago, certainly.

10:22.716 --> 10:33.049
One thing you'll have noticed is the way that so often a collector who works in one area collects one type of thing, likes to think that he will die with his name in life.

10:38.918 --> 11:07.727
there's so many opens it's unbelievable exactly and I'm just in the edges of one at the moment where a yachtsman a British yachtsman in 1908 started to form a library and an association for yachtsmen 1908 and he bought with very expert help he bought all the finest books he could to do with the sea and sea charts

11:09.243 --> 11:14.710
And he died intestate and unmarried.

11:14.730 --> 11:18.234
But these things remained with the association that he founded.

11:19.416 --> 11:22.920
And there now is the most wonderful library.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.762
And the Yotsmans Association.

11:24.842 --> 11:27.265
Can you name the gentleman?

11:27.285 --> 11:29.648
His name was Hanson.

11:29.668 --> 11:31.731
It's his library catalog.

11:31.751 --> 11:35.476
And the Cruising Association Library.

11:35.496 --> 11:38.980
The Cruising Association Library Catalogue, that's O-G-U-E.

11:39.533 --> 11:39.973
1931.

11:40.074 --> 11:40.634
His name.

11:40.674 --> 11:45.819
This is his book here, right?

11:45.839 --> 11:46.140
Yes.

11:47.981 --> 11:51.225
This is a catalog of his library.

11:51.245 --> 11:52.306
It was founded in 1908.

11:53.287 --> 11:59.233
Persons of Nautical Sympathies, combining as amateurs to advance the knowledge of the C.S.

11:59.413 --> 12:02.196
Pats, and all that anything about them is.

12:02.216 --> 12:06.340
He was looking for his name, so I passed this, and it's on the top page there.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.523
Gathered by Herbert, H-E-R-B-E-R-T-J.

12:10.010 --> 12:15.397
Hanson, H-A-N-S-O-N, comma, O period, B period, E period.

12:15.557 --> 12:18.000
That is our initials for life.

12:18.380 --> 12:18.581
Yeah.

12:18.621 --> 12:19.041
What is that?

12:19.221 --> 12:19.982
Whatever was that?

12:20.563 --> 12:21.685
Is that a title of some sort?

12:22.445 --> 12:24.328
O-B-E, Order of the Virgin Empire.

12:24.348 --> 12:24.448
Okay.

12:24.468 --> 12:24.548
Yes.

12:25.629 --> 12:26.811
Which is quite distinguished.

12:26.831 --> 12:29.394
And this was published at Chiltern Court, London.

12:30.335 --> 12:34.320
I'm just saying, so I can look this book up at Harvard.

12:34.340 --> 12:36.323
I'm sure we'll have a copy of it.

12:36.343 --> 12:37.244
Not necessarily.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.747
And anyway, the...

12:40.165 --> 12:47.835
The association grew and grew and grew till it's got, I've forgotten, 5,000 members or something now.

12:47.855 --> 12:56.186
And it now has the most magnificent premises for the time being in the marina in the city of London, near the ivory house.

12:56.707 --> 12:58.389
How did they manage to keep his collection?

12:58.850 --> 12:59.651
How did they retain it?

13:00.432 --> 13:02.855
He just passed to the association.

13:02.895 --> 13:03.536
Did he pass it?

13:03.556 --> 13:04.958
Did he make the provisions for this?

13:05.242 --> 13:05.963
Apparently not.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.006
But it had always been there.

13:09.027 --> 13:12.072
It had always been in the castle room of the association.

13:12.092 --> 13:19.062
Had there been an heir, it might well have wound up in the auction halls.

13:19.082 --> 13:19.763
Exactly.

13:19.783 --> 13:20.784
How do you feel about that?

13:21.105 --> 13:21.946
Well, that's the point.

13:22.727 --> 13:25.591
I've been, for instance, to the New York.com.

13:25.611 --> 13:30.458
There's no books, anything to touch this library.

13:30.478 --> 13:34.624
But the point has come now, where that is now the association's principal asset,

13:35.718 --> 13:39.223
It's worth certainly a million pounds.

13:39.243 --> 13:40.765
And they need new premises.

13:42.328 --> 13:45.552
So they've got a double problem.

13:45.572 --> 13:54.225
Firstly, they want to ensure that this marvellous collection stays as a collection because these are a lot of them are books of maps and sea charts.

13:54.245 --> 14:02.837
If they went under the hammer, they would almost certainly be cut up and turned into framed maps, which would be tragic.

14:02.857 --> 14:04.780
And yet at the same time, they need the money.

14:05.333 --> 14:33.535
because if they can have some money at least from it then they get themselves new premises the idea would be premises that they own in London where they can continue to do what they think is their right thing I'm wearing a tie now is to encourage yachting and so a scheme is being developed at the moment it's a good runner

14:34.190 --> 14:48.307
where the University of Cambridge might be prepared to house the whole collection as the Cruising Association, I agree, where... Oh, right, okay, yeah.

14:48.968 --> 14:51.872
Where... Right.

14:52.032 --> 14:55.416
Oh, I can arrange cash, yes.

14:55.516 --> 14:57.138
Yes, right.

14:58.780 --> 15:02.745
And they would be prepared to house it

15:03.586 --> 15:12.561
insure it, look after it, make it accessible, provide a reading room where members of the association could go to see the books.

15:12.581 --> 15:30.690
Geographically it is removed from the... Well, look, Cambridge is very central, and the train service is very good indeed, and give them a certain amount of money, well, quite a substantial amount of money as well, and it's quite an

15:33.607 --> 16:02.955
retain title to it but it has a home and it's open to scholars and it's in a scholarly so it would satisfy several conditions at once one would be that the collection would remain intact it would not be destroyed or broken up it would be available to scholars and yet the association would have some of the financial benefit from it that would be a good deal so it might be a good deal we'll put this together the financial general process committee

16:03.678 --> 16:08.564
And I'm the old librarian, so I've had a bit of interest in this.

16:08.904 --> 16:12.708
How would you feel if this collection would have been broken up?

16:12.788 --> 16:13.850
It would be tragic.

16:13.910 --> 16:14.931
Because you're a book dealer.

16:14.991 --> 16:15.492
Exactly.

16:15.572 --> 16:20.497
And yet, I make my livelihood partly from breaking up collections.

16:20.517 --> 16:29.508
Because if you wanted to start a book collection, you'd have to start somewhere, and the books that you would be buying would have come sometime from somebody's own collection.

16:29.708 --> 16:30.429
And that's good.

16:30.829 --> 16:33.212
Which is what we exist for, is to re-

16:33.428 --> 16:36.351
It is important that the books find a new home.

16:36.391 --> 16:38.334
I mean, there's nothing bad.

16:38.754 --> 16:43.099
But on the other hand, the collector is generally secretive, generally.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.746
He can't possibly have people in his home other than very, very special friends.

16:49.526 --> 16:54.652
You couldn't have random readers, because they might be thieves as well.

16:54.852 --> 16:59.077
Especially when you've got books that have got pictures and maps in them.

16:59.097 --> 17:01.180
Well, that means you've got to have a reading room.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.182
You've got to have supervising staff.

17:04.664 --> 17:08.527
And then, at the same time, you've got the enormous escalating values.

17:09.829 --> 17:17.916
Where, in that Blasterides library, no, not in that, in the Brachman, there's that sort of thing, where one book was Hobhouse's Albania.

17:18.416 --> 17:27.284
And I used to sell that book perhaps for £100, and somebody at the auction sale went and spent, I think, £5,000 on it.

17:28.425 --> 17:31.828
Well, that makes a problem of how to house it in security.

17:32.229 --> 17:33.150
We look after it.

17:33.390 --> 17:34.671
When you say somebody paid,

17:35.275 --> 17:40.463
But also implicitly acknowledges that there's an underbidder who went for 4,500.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.286
Not always.

17:43.689 --> 17:44.630
It can be a reserve.

17:46.834 --> 17:53.404
It can even be the nasty thing you don't talk about, somebody on the back wall.

17:53.424 --> 17:53.565
Yes.

17:53.785 --> 17:57.110
It's a thing you don't talk about, but it happens.

17:58.212 --> 18:01.317
It's been alleged by a fellow by the name of Charles Hamilton

18:01.938 --> 18:04.000
who I've interviewed.

18:04.020 --> 18:04.761
The autograph dealer, yes.

18:04.781 --> 18:05.501
An interesting man.

18:05.521 --> 18:07.503
Would you talk to Graham Arato as well?

18:08.804 --> 18:11.567
Those are the two... Have you spoken to him?

18:11.587 --> 18:13.749
No, I haven't talked to Arato yet, no.

18:13.769 --> 18:16.211
Who had that wonderful article in The New Yorker about him.

18:16.231 --> 18:16.671
That's right.

18:16.851 --> 18:17.532
The profile.

18:17.912 --> 18:18.793
That's right.

18:18.813 --> 18:20.815
And who stopped an auction at some of his in New York.

18:21.516 --> 18:23.537
And who challenged the auctioneer to produce the underbier.

18:24.358 --> 18:25.799
And there wasn't one.

18:25.819 --> 18:27.040
So they had to start the biddingy beer.

18:27.621 --> 18:29.903
And Graham Arato bought the thing for a great deal less.

18:30.575 --> 18:32.738
Now, do you think that was a correct thing for him to do?

18:32.758 --> 18:36.263
It was a correct thing to do, and we all cheered him on that.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.969
There's another collection I saw at Cambridge.

18:40.950 --> 18:48.321
There was a marvellous man in London who was a doctor and who collected books about psychiatry.

18:48.341 --> 18:57.134
In its widest sense, psychiatry, madness, all sorts of stuff.

18:57.154 --> 18:58.135
So there's a technical out there.

19:00.157 --> 19:02.780
German collection.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.521
I only cried your end of it.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.142
Yes.

19:05.302 --> 19:12.089
Which was given to a Jewish chap to take to safety to the States before the war.

19:13.250 --> 19:17.174
And he kept it all through the war.

19:17.194 --> 19:26.603
And now only last year or so, he put it in the facilities in New York for sale as his white property, which it wasn't.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.965
And apparently the rumour went all around New York very quickly.

19:29.485 --> 19:33.188
that this stuff was really hot and shouldn't really be sold.

19:33.409 --> 19:33.989
Was it sold?

19:34.209 --> 19:38.253
It had been entrusted to him for the good of the Jewish nation.

19:38.393 --> 19:40.515
Can you tell me the news of what?

19:40.815 --> 19:41.436
I'll check it out.

19:41.536 --> 19:45.099
I don't speak German, but Hochstuhl is what it is anyway.

19:45.319 --> 19:45.720
And it was?

19:45.840 --> 19:46.780
Was it sold itself?

19:47.001 --> 19:47.281
Yes.

19:47.301 --> 19:49.283
And it went through.

19:50.163 --> 19:55.849
And we, alas, bought one lot out of this for no less than the British Museum.

19:55.869 --> 19:57.450
And we got it here and we paid for it.

19:58.139 --> 20:12.895
And in no time we got a visit from the representative of the Attorney General of New York, Mr. Edwards.

20:12.915 --> 20:13.196
Really?

20:13.216 --> 20:13.756
That's a fascinating story.

20:13.776 --> 20:17.701
And we said, well, we can't hand this over.

20:17.721 --> 20:21.925
We bought this correctly as auction for a major client in this country or something.

20:21.946 --> 20:27.792
And finally in the end I had to capitulate and send it back to New York and have our money back more or less.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.109
So this was material that was stolen during the war?

20:46.891 --> 20:56.687
No, it was sent correctly from Berlin or wherever, when the Nazis were closing in, for safety to the States.

20:56.707 --> 21:03.097
But the man who took it, instead of handing it over to the Jewish organization in the States, didn't do it.

21:03.418 --> 21:06.543
And yes, exciting, isn't it?

21:06.563 --> 21:08.426
That's for his notes, isn't it?

21:08.866 --> 21:09.287
Yes.

21:09.554 --> 21:13.238
Yes, okay, because Robert's handling this.

21:13.258 --> 21:13.558
Yes.

21:16.261 --> 21:18.604
He's one of the most knowledgeable men in the world who works with us.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.306
What is his name?

21:22.128 --> 21:22.889
John Collins.

21:23.209 --> 21:29.776
And he is the world of Barley on perhaps the greatest literary forger of all time, Thomas J. Wise.

21:29.796 --> 21:31.919
Thomas J. Wise figures in his book.

21:32.239 --> 21:33.741
He's doing the new edition.

21:33.761 --> 21:34.081
Really?

21:34.442 --> 21:35.903
Which will be out fairly soon.

21:35.923 --> 21:37.485
He's in a vast state of preparation.

21:37.853 --> 22:07.152
may have to talk to him with a lot of fresh information i'm coming back by the way i tell you you shouldn't have started this because it could go on forever well i'm going to let it go on until you kick me out yes well i must be doing that um there's there's no end to it tell me a little bit tell me how much time i have by the way so i can i can pace myself and kind of cover a few of the areas that i've lost it anyway yes because i've promised to make a few phone calls as well so anyway it's gone yes all right yes okay

22:07.638 --> 22:10.521
So this was stolen material?

22:10.561 --> 22:11.582
It wasn't stolen.

22:11.602 --> 22:14.486
It was... He appropriated it.

22:14.506 --> 22:15.787
It was misappropriated.

22:15.867 --> 22:16.788
Misappropriated.

22:17.229 --> 22:19.291
And then he consigned it to South Wales?

22:20.052 --> 22:20.272
Yes.

22:20.292 --> 22:21.413
In the name of his wife.

22:21.573 --> 22:22.535
In the name of his wife.

22:23.035 --> 22:24.937
And the thing ran smoothly.

22:25.157 --> 22:27.981
John Marion should be asked about this thing, shouldn't he, I think?

22:28.221 --> 22:32.886
And some ladies started to make a fuss in the press in New York.

22:36.713 --> 22:38.215
was not entitled to be sold at auction.

22:38.575 --> 22:44.542
Sold to me is between us and doing some pretty interesting things lately.

22:44.722 --> 22:51.490
You have to be very careful what you write about that, but I get quite distressed with the way they do these things.

22:51.510 --> 22:53.493
You know, the thing with the painting with it.

22:53.593 --> 23:01.622
That's a buzzer on the front door says I know that someone's opened the door.

23:02.343 --> 23:03.885
It's going to be quite useful.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.421
because stealing is a problem.

23:06.441 --> 23:07.602
Nobody plays a great deal here.

23:08.123 --> 23:11.986
Did you hear about the case in the States where they just arrested this guy out in Iowa?

23:12.006 --> 23:12.266
Yes.

23:12.767 --> 23:19.833
Have you heard... Yes, we've heard the fringes of that one, but I was a little bit... I have all the cuttings from Iowa, by the way.

23:19.853 --> 23:21.314
Would you like me to send you some of these?

23:21.334 --> 23:25.678
Another ghastly one is the, of course, is the Mormon one.

23:25.718 --> 23:27.140
Well, that's murder.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.542
Which involves sending... Bombs.

23:29.562 --> 23:30.082
Mail bombs.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.265
And as long as you kept it level,

23:34.257 --> 23:58.527
it wouldn't go off but as soon as you took it well that was a case of crime this kid in iowa is really a video kleptomaniac he apparently really steals the things not for greed but for the object yeah he's now they've sent him to a place yeah to be looked at to be looking at the creole of ivory in chicago and what's really amusing in a bizarre sort of way is they don't want to admit that they've had things stolen

23:59.148 --> 24:00.709
Isn't it amazing?

24:00.770 --> 24:13.822
Well, that's back to this one, that I have had to ensure that these yachtsmen's books are under lock and key, which means the members can't see them except by appointment at the moment.

24:13.842 --> 24:16.304
Well, then people will say, what's the good of them if they can't be seen?

24:16.725 --> 24:19.487
If they were put on open shelves, they would be stolen.

24:20.888 --> 24:21.429
That's correct.

24:21.469 --> 24:23.050
They have to be protected.

24:23.071 --> 24:27.855
And so I'm afraid in a case like this, probably the only thing is going to be...

24:28.848 --> 24:32.752
a home where they can be under proper security.

24:33.833 --> 24:36.837
Tell me a little bit about being a fourth generation bookman.

24:36.937 --> 24:37.637
What's that?

24:37.657 --> 24:39.820
Well, you were brought up.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.301
Exactly.

24:41.341 --> 24:45.165
From your first memories, you must have books.

24:45.766 --> 24:46.847
Of my bedroom, even full of books.

24:47.007 --> 24:47.648
And the reverence.

24:47.928 --> 24:49.510
Yes.

24:49.530 --> 24:54.936
And one of them was, never did you put a teacup down on a book.

24:54.956 --> 24:58.720
And if we children took a book off any of my father's shelves,

24:59.155 --> 25:04.682
to take to our bedroom to read, he'd see the gap and he'd search the house till he found that book to get back in there.

25:04.763 --> 25:06.465
And we'd say, well, what's the point of it?

25:06.485 --> 25:08.207
Why can't we have it?

25:08.227 --> 25:08.988
Why has it got to be?

25:10.130 --> 25:10.971
And we didn't understand.

25:11.011 --> 25:15.377
Did you know from the earliest days that you would be a book-learing yourself?

25:15.397 --> 25:15.797
No, no.

25:16.198 --> 25:17.740
Tell me how this came to pass.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.725
Oh, come on.

25:22.566 --> 25:23.748
But what did you think you would be?

25:23.768 --> 25:24.589
What did you want to be?

25:25.312 --> 25:32.441
And so I went off to the Navy for three whole years.

25:32.762 --> 25:34.744
I spent three years as an evil officer.

25:35.385 --> 25:41.133
And then when that was over, would I accept what you call the GI charter to go to university with a free place?

25:41.894 --> 25:44.076
And the father's comment was, well, you've wasted enough time now.

25:44.096 --> 25:44.978
It's three years gone.

25:45.338 --> 25:46.780
This time you got started on some work.

25:48.542 --> 25:52.247
But in those days, you started at the very bottom.

25:53.948 --> 25:57.551
You were given no encouragement, no money.

25:57.571 --> 26:00.574
You were almost, almost made unwelcome.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.638
And you just had to put up with it.

26:04.658 --> 26:05.539
They're talking about here.

26:05.559 --> 26:07.861
Yes, and it was the same in other bookshops as well.

26:08.862 --> 26:14.407
Tony Rota may well tell you the same, because he came into that business from the world of something else.

26:17.570 --> 26:20.513
I forgot now, politics or whatever it was.

26:21.944 --> 26:25.669
Maybe his son will come into it now.

26:25.909 --> 26:30.054
But we're almost the oldest left now.

26:30.074 --> 26:35.722
Our young son is on holiday today.

26:35.742 --> 26:37.564
So he's made five.

26:37.584 --> 26:39.286
He's a good bookseller.

26:39.306 --> 26:39.727
He's Edward May.

26:39.827 --> 26:43.772
He's made himself a great expert, for instance, on T. Lawrence.

26:43.792 --> 26:46.195
So he's busy building T. Lawrence collections now.

26:46.215 --> 26:47.056
For individuals?

26:47.096 --> 26:51.141
For one particular individual, yes.

26:51.161 --> 26:51.782
That's an amazing story.

26:52.640 --> 27:08.401
In other words, what happens is that people will come into the door sometimes, come in the front shop, and they almost say, I want to be a book collector.

27:08.481 --> 27:09.523
How shall I start?

27:09.543 --> 27:10.885
And what have you got already?

27:11.566 --> 27:12.507
Have you got any books?

27:12.527 --> 27:15.170
He doesn't know where to collect when he comes to it.

27:15.191 --> 27:17.694
He possibly doesn't.

27:17.714 --> 27:19.997
It's very, very wonderful if you do act.

27:20.416 --> 27:48.853
and to get somebody who's just beginning who's just suddenly got the idea they'd like to be a book collector and of course the first thing to do is to link up with a good dealer that you can get on with and there's a different dealer for every sort of person and a dealer that you can get on with and trust and don't go first to the auction room don't go go to the auction room to sit and watch and listen but go to the bookshops

27:49.458 --> 27:52.383
And you can say, why is this book more than that one?

27:52.403 --> 27:53.004
What's the point?

27:54.126 --> 27:59.374
And then the book seller will carefully explain to you why that copy is so much better.

27:59.394 --> 28:00.476
And there will be a price on it.

28:01.057 --> 28:05.544
Is this the satisfaction as a book dealer in building collections for other people?

28:05.564 --> 28:05.805
It is.

28:06.506 --> 28:09.070
Because are you a collector, by the way, yourself?

28:09.751 --> 28:11.474
Not really, but the price is now.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.477
But the satisfaction for you?

28:13.577 --> 28:15.280
There's one of my own books on that book.

28:18.787 --> 28:19.868
that he used to love to collect.

28:20.609 --> 28:22.090
That's one of the greatest books in the world.

28:22.491 --> 28:22.991
Which is?

28:23.692 --> 28:31.559
The Trial of the Lieutenant Colonel G. Johnston for deposing William Bly.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.220
Exactly.

28:33.221 --> 28:37.785
And this was the man who was in command of the army in Australia.

28:37.805 --> 28:43.491
And Bly, as governor, cut off the rackets to do the run.

28:43.591 --> 28:44.832
He was a pretty good man.

28:44.852 --> 28:47.595
But he was a disciplinarian.

28:48.200 --> 28:48.921
They didn't like it.

28:49.802 --> 28:51.765
It was a conflict colony for God's sake.

28:51.785 --> 28:52.847
Yes, but this was the army.

28:53.328 --> 29:07.108
And so what happened there was that the man in charge of the army, of the military detachment there, of the guards, arrested the governor and locked him up.

29:07.128 --> 29:09.311
And this is the court-martial of the chap.

29:09.391 --> 29:10.954
And this is the manuscript?

29:11.074 --> 29:14.058
No, this is the printed book, which is extremely scarce anyway.

29:14.459 --> 29:16.582
And this is Bly's own copy of it.

29:17.002 --> 29:17.363
Oh, my goodness.

29:17.798 --> 29:18.960
This was one of his coffees.

29:18.980 --> 29:19.621
This was your father's?

29:20.322 --> 29:21.945
This was my father's, yes.

29:21.965 --> 29:22.726
Let's be very gentle with it.

29:23.046 --> 29:25.370
Look.

29:25.571 --> 29:26.612
We're a old boy.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.517
To whoever it is, Campbell.

29:30.679 --> 29:35.787
And my father put his signature in as well.

29:36.428 --> 29:37.410
Frank B. Maggs.

29:38.952 --> 29:42.237
And that's his mark where he put collated perfect Frank Maggs as well.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.481
And the point about that is that that is

29:47.296 --> 29:48.878
in its printed, in its boards.

29:48.898 --> 29:51.141
It has to be about 200 years old, I would say.

29:51.221 --> 29:51.621
Exactly.

29:51.661 --> 29:53.263
It was done at the time.

29:53.284 --> 29:54.165
Published at 12 shillings.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.147
So it's had a bit of a repair on the spine.

29:56.708 --> 29:59.812
12 shillings was expensive, I would think.

29:59.892 --> 30:00.453
Yes.

30:02.075 --> 30:03.857
Only a handful of copies of that were done.

30:04.578 --> 30:09.804
Because so many of the great books of the Bly story were done in small numbers and are very, very scarce.

30:10.085 --> 30:13.629
Now, you could come in and say, I want to collect Bly.

30:13.649 --> 30:16.813
And one would say, well, how much money have you got to put into it?

30:17.435 --> 30:20.221
And one has to say that, too, of course.

30:20.241 --> 30:25.112
And so there's a collector I can think of, and the point is the living ones who are still collecting have to be anonymous.

30:26.135 --> 30:26.716
That's the difficulty.

30:26.736 --> 30:28.019
One can only talk about the dead ones.

30:28.821 --> 30:29.803
For security purposes?

30:29.823 --> 30:30.244
Exactly.

30:30.685 --> 30:32.068
And because they want to be anonymous.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.454
But a man who decided that he would collect Bly.

30:34.654 --> 30:37.256
Do they want to be anonymous for security purposes?

30:37.276 --> 30:38.638
Or because they want to be anonymous?

30:38.778 --> 30:41.180
No, anonymous very much because of security.

30:41.420 --> 30:46.284
See, I've made contact with Lady Eccles, for instance, Mary Hyatt.

30:46.304 --> 30:47.185
Have you now?

30:47.205 --> 30:49.227
The greatest in the world.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.068
And you've seen.

30:50.648 --> 30:51.669
That was the point about this.

30:51.729 --> 30:53.271
Have you seen?

30:54.372 --> 30:57.815
She is the number one lady book collector in the States.

30:57.995 --> 30:58.295
Oh, indeed.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.136
And the Roxburgh Club.

30:59.156 --> 31:00.317
Look at that.

31:00.787 --> 31:14.610
founded in 1812, I think that's right, of distinguished, almost all Englishmen originally, and then she is the first lady to be elected to the membership.

31:14.630 --> 31:26.490
She's 40 members only, and nearly all dukes, and look at that, a great Englishman, and she has come in as the first lady.

31:26.723 --> 31:30.992
She is very supportive of my project to finish the story.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.718
Well, thank you for saying that.

31:34.059 --> 31:40.633
But she is reluctant to talk about her collecting because she wrote me a letter.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.678
Or about her husband's collection.

31:42.698 --> 31:45.123
Or about her husband's collecting for security purposes.

31:45.143 --> 31:46.646
And I have to be sympathetic to her.

31:46.686 --> 31:47.027
That's right.

31:47.362 --> 31:50.665
And I said at the outset, I will be sympathetic, I will understand.

31:50.725 --> 31:52.487
But she is one of the greatest ladies in the world.

31:52.547 --> 31:56.350
I said, but I hope you'll talk to me about collecting in general, and I believe she will.

31:57.151 --> 32:00.074
Right now we're negotiating the terms of our discussion.

32:00.154 --> 32:03.917
The fact is I've made contact, I've met her at the Gorgia Club.

32:03.937 --> 32:05.138
Did you now?

32:05.719 --> 32:08.822
Well, I met Mr. Scheide there, and I have been to Scheide's collection.

32:08.842 --> 32:11.524
Of course, his is protected at Princeton, so he can talk.

32:12.024 --> 32:14.787
But I had a lovely afternoon with him, four hours.

32:15.037 --> 32:15.598
Yes.

32:15.618 --> 32:20.064
He took out his 42-line Bible and placed it in right.

32:20.084 --> 32:23.829
Your job is going to be how to digest all this down into anything usable.

32:23.849 --> 32:24.370
Oh, I can do it.

32:24.691 --> 32:33.123
Tell me just briefly, and then you can kick me out, but you mentioned when an individual walks in the door and says, I want to collect.

32:34.024 --> 32:39.812
And I gather that the satisfaction for you, because you personally don't collect to any great extent,

32:40.973 --> 32:52.345
Because of the, of course I've got a collection of books, but I could not be an active book collector now because I would be thinking that it should be used for business here.

32:52.365 --> 32:53.166
It wouldn't be my own.

32:53.226 --> 32:54.687
You'd have to separate.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.669
You can't separate the two.

32:56.689 --> 33:00.273
To be a really top-notch dealer, you want to think of the client, I guess.

33:00.713 --> 33:09.883
If I were a sole trader, just in business on my own, but I've got all these other directors to think of.

33:10.252 --> 33:18.060
If you have a wonderful bargain comes in, and you see a chance of a wonderful sale, well, you can't put it under your own bed.

33:18.741 --> 33:21.143
Now, Rosenbach, for instance, on the other day... That was another matter.

33:21.324 --> 33:24.507
He would say, if you don't buy it, I'm going to keep it for myself.

33:24.547 --> 33:25.007
Right, exactly.

33:25.288 --> 33:27.530
But it was a ploy, I think, as much as anything.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.672
It was his own business, and so he could do that.

33:29.692 --> 33:31.014
Yeah, and he could do it.

33:31.534 --> 33:35.098
But I've got a thing about this man who decided he wanted to collect Admiral Bly.

33:35.679 --> 33:35.979
Uh-huh, okay.

33:35.999 --> 33:38.942
And so he made just two simple questions.

33:40.643 --> 33:46.889
The best books about Bly cost £10,000 a piece, that sort of thing.

33:46.909 --> 33:49.952
And there might be, what, ten of them, something of that sort.

33:49.972 --> 33:51.593
And he hadn't got that sort of money.

33:51.613 --> 33:59.741
And so he made the decision, instead, he would collect the ordinary books about Bly, which you might buy for £3, £5, £10.

33:59.761 --> 34:08.929
So he's got a whole library of Bly, but without the very high spots on the whole, because he couldn't...

34:10.563 --> 34:12.986
really afford that.

34:13.026 --> 34:14.267
His wife wouldn't let him have it either.

34:14.508 --> 34:15.829
So this is an actual case then?

34:16.029 --> 34:16.630
It is, yes.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.232
I thought it was hypothetical.

34:18.312 --> 34:20.715
No, it's an actual case.

34:20.735 --> 34:28.104
But anyway, to finish my question, so your satisfaction must then come in helping form other people's collections.

34:28.124 --> 34:28.824
That's right.

34:28.844 --> 34:35.692
You must take great satisfaction in seeing, even though it's owned physically by another person, I built this collection.

34:36.193 --> 34:37.675
My taste is involved.

34:37.695 --> 34:39.557
And the one my father built like that.

34:39.908 --> 34:46.857
is the library of the National Museum of Greenwich.

34:47.277 --> 34:49.580
And that's an extraordinary story.

34:49.600 --> 34:55.467
An American came to my father between the wars and said, I want to have sea books.

34:55.607 --> 34:58.151
And so he went all over the place buying sea books for this man.

34:58.171 --> 35:03.137
And every time the chap came, there would be another stack of sea books for him to buy.

35:03.157 --> 35:07.282
And suddenly the Depression hit the stakes with no more dust.

35:07.302 --> 35:08.263
And he couldn't buy any more books.

35:09.084 --> 35:09.865
My father was left with us.

35:14.030 --> 35:39.219
And just at that very moment, the great ship owner in this country, Sir James Caird, had always spelled C-A-I-R-D, came to my father and said, I want to establish a naval museum in Britain.

35:39.239 --> 35:39.739
So there hasn't been one.

35:39.759 --> 35:41.942
And he and his friend, Professor Callender, who was Professor of Naval History of Greenwich, got together.

35:42.062 --> 35:42.923
And one provided the money.

35:43.730 --> 35:54.682
And the other one provided a lot of the expertise.

35:54.702 --> 36:01.609
Sorry, I'm infamous at this sort of thing.

36:01.629 --> 36:03.451
I did a little paper on some of this.

36:03.471 --> 36:05.553
Is there a bill?

36:05.573 --> 36:07.255
In some way, I don't know what I've done with it.

36:07.395 --> 36:10.118
And she made me print it, which was terrible.

36:10.138 --> 36:11.239
I'd like to have a copy of it.

36:12.130 --> 36:15.013
I talk, that's the trouble, and I don't write enough.

36:15.033 --> 36:19.958
But I was going to say, and so this naval collection began to build up.

36:19.978 --> 36:27.685
And then it was established there at Greenwich, was opened by the Queen in 1930, the King, sorry, in 1938 or thereabouts.

36:27.705 --> 36:31.189
And my father was the principal advisor for books.

36:32.370 --> 36:37.615
And you can go there now and you'll see the finest books to do with the sea, perhaps anywhere in the world.

36:38.506 --> 36:40.629
How about the stuff that he sold to the American?

36:40.649 --> 36:41.530
What happened to that?

36:41.550 --> 36:42.831
I don't want the camera then.

36:43.092 --> 36:44.453
But that must have been pretty choice stuff.

36:44.473 --> 36:45.234
He probably was.

36:45.995 --> 36:46.556
There's a point.

36:46.576 --> 36:48.198
I ought to get our files out.

36:48.218 --> 36:48.959
See where it is.

36:49.039 --> 36:51.001
And find where that is.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.523
That's the investigator for it.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.447
I know, exactly.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.228
How about yourself?

36:56.748 --> 37:04.878
What collections do you personally take great satisfaction in having them put together?

37:04.898 --> 37:07.361
Things modesty overcomes me.

37:07.441 --> 37:07.922
Don't live.

37:08.257 --> 37:09.959
or throw modesty to the winds.

37:09.979 --> 37:15.747
I think it's black at the moment.

37:15.847 --> 37:21.976
In any case, I suppose probably a professional black would come over me because that would be so recent that one wouldn't talk about it.

37:21.996 --> 37:24.519
Okay, let me ask you another question.

37:24.699 --> 37:29.446
Did you have anything to do with the building of the garden collection with Mr. Peter No More?

37:29.466 --> 37:29.646
No.

37:30.046 --> 37:30.888
Do you know anything about it?

37:30.908 --> 37:32.229
What a strange story.

37:32.269 --> 37:35.754
That introduction to that catalogue is phony.

37:35.774 --> 37:37.116
There's something wrong with that.

37:37.366 --> 37:40.871
When I put off the machine, that will be one of my great chapters, by the way.

37:41.171 --> 37:45.337
If you were able to investigate that, that would be a great piece of investigative journalism.

37:45.357 --> 37:46.739
I've done it rather thoroughly.

37:46.759 --> 37:47.039
Yes.

37:48.481 --> 37:52.367
And it's quite, quite an experiment.

37:52.948 --> 37:55.651
Yes, because... And I'd be happy to tell you a few tidbits if you're interested.

37:55.792 --> 37:56.973
There's corruption there as well.

37:57.834 --> 37:58.295
Ah, yes.

37:59.697 --> 38:01.199
Very strange man.

38:01.219 --> 38:01.940
Very strange.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.302
Haven O'Moore.

38:03.322 --> 38:03.422
Yeah.

38:03.442 --> 38:06.466
If you write that down... Yes, I knew him.

38:06.486 --> 38:06.867
Yes.

38:07.049 --> 38:08.391
Do you know him?

38:08.411 --> 38:09.151
Yeah, well, yes.

38:10.893 --> 38:11.774
What does that say?

38:11.875 --> 38:16.960
Well, it's an anagram or something, is it?

38:16.980 --> 38:18.502
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

38:18.903 --> 38:21.746
He doesn't exist before the 1950s, from all I can find.

38:21.946 --> 38:22.146
Yes.

38:22.447 --> 38:24.850
He comes full-blown out of the 1950s.

38:25.210 --> 38:30.096
And your man, the principal man, is dead, you see, as Warren Howell.

38:30.116 --> 38:36.243
And the other man, Sid, to death with Cain, is dead as well.

38:36.263 --> 38:36.583
Well...

38:36.935 --> 38:37.676
There are a few.

38:38.276 --> 38:43.161
But did you know anything about Omar?

38:43.181 --> 38:44.423
Had you met him at all?

38:44.583 --> 38:45.424
Mystery man.

38:45.564 --> 38:48.006
Well, of course I met him.

38:48.787 --> 38:50.309
Did he come in here?

38:50.329 --> 38:53.032
Did you sell him anything?

38:55.134 --> 38:58.477
I've seen a few people who had some dealings with him over here.

38:58.497 --> 38:58.677
Yes.

39:00.599 --> 39:03.562
You know, none of this money was his, Omar.

39:04.123 --> 39:06.165
He was working with this young fellow's money.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.284
Exactly.

39:09.225 --> 39:09.906
Nobody knew this.

39:11.768 --> 39:19.976
And what happened is, this young man's father, who had made some dollars, all of a sudden one day said, what happened to all this money?

39:20.276 --> 39:26.121
And that started a suit in Superior Court in Massachusetts, where I've been investigating.

39:26.282 --> 39:30.005
And when I started to inquire, the judge impounded the material.

39:31.186 --> 39:34.009
However, strictly as a result of my inquiry,

39:34.613 --> 39:42.907
I will have a court proceeding to unseal it, but in the meantime, I've been able to find the material in other areas, and it's quite fascinating.

39:42.927 --> 39:44.489
And behind the scenes will be solubus.

39:45.130 --> 39:50.119
Behind the scenes will be solubus, yes.

39:50.139 --> 39:50.820
Under the war of solubus.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.384
I start this chapter with a quote from some reason.

39:53.404 --> 39:56.289
I said, why are you selling this?

39:56.369 --> 39:58.933
Why are these people selling this collection?

39:58.953 --> 39:59.895
And the answer was,

40:00.280 --> 40:05.968
Let's just say that two collectors have decided to split up and go their separate ways.

40:05.988 --> 40:06.549
Yes, yes.

40:06.569 --> 40:12.937
And then what I thought, actually, one of the most extraordinary, I give a goose flesh when I think about it.

40:12.957 --> 40:14.039
But that introduction.

40:14.219 --> 40:15.040
Well, I've got better.

40:15.060 --> 40:21.389
See, he founded an institute of traditional science, and he was going to build this institute in Cambridge.

40:22.010 --> 40:25.815
I have all the papers that he filed with the Secretary of State outlining the purpose.

40:26.167 --> 40:31.214
Because he claimed to be a non-profit agency, he had to file pictures with the IRS, which I have.

40:33.418 --> 40:37.384
I'm seeing somebody at 1 o'clock who knew the young man in New York.

40:37.924 --> 40:39.246
She's here in London.

40:40.849 --> 40:44.614
That's a very interesting story.

40:44.734 --> 40:45.916
Investigative journalism.

40:45.936 --> 40:46.417
Indeed.

40:46.437 --> 40:47.659
Applied to book collecting.

40:48.119 --> 40:50.222
That's one chapter.

40:50.623 --> 40:52.005
It's about a chapter or something.

40:52.947 --> 40:58.155
You're saying that as a general statement?

40:58.175 --> 41:00.698
You have to be careful how you print that too.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.481
What are they?

41:02.541 --> 41:07.789
They're things that they want to have for themselves.

41:09.391 --> 41:10.653
Now what's that mean?

41:10.753 --> 41:12.335
They pile them under their chair.

41:14.418 --> 41:19.085
And you go to homes where books have been collected.

41:19.506 --> 41:22.330
There'll sometimes be cardboard boxes still sealed up.

41:23.288 --> 41:24.249
We've just got to have them.

41:25.892 --> 41:28.836
Is it just the acquisition of them that's important, do you think?

41:28.856 --> 41:29.537
For some people.

41:31.560 --> 41:37.128
The general thing that we don't like to talk about is the financial side of it.

41:37.148 --> 41:41.775
Because that's where the thing has changed so much recently, is that you used to be able to collect books so modestly.

41:42.576 --> 41:45.440
There was another library I was much involved with was Fuller.

41:46.822 --> 41:47.623
F-U-L-L-E-R.

41:48.164 --> 41:52.350
Captain A-W-F Fuller, F-U-L-L-E-R.

41:53.377 --> 42:06.254
collected basically objects and paintings, things like Shrunk Heads and Benin Bronzes, and massive stuff that went to the Field Museum in Chicago.

42:06.474 --> 42:07.135
What were the books?

42:07.455 --> 42:13.964
And the books were the backup books with the collection, which were the books of travel on West Africa and Pacific Island.

42:13.984 --> 42:15.246
That fellow was in American?

42:15.306 --> 42:17.208
No, he was English.

42:17.228 --> 42:23.316
And the library went to the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, where you can see it now.

42:23.819 --> 42:30.986
So it was rather sad that the printed books that tied in with the ethnographical collection were separated.

42:31.166 --> 42:32.207
But they went to Honolulu?

42:32.388 --> 42:32.688
Yes.

42:32.708 --> 42:37.112
So there was a major book collection in Honolulu that I didn't know about.

42:37.132 --> 42:37.453
Yes.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.475
It's amazing these things we learned.

42:39.755 --> 42:40.055
Yes.

42:40.536 --> 42:49.204
But it must be that a lot of librarians, where they've got funds available, like to buy a ready-made collection.

42:49.224 --> 42:52.948
And then another thing you've got to touch on there is what about duplication and triplication?

42:54.093 --> 42:58.138
Well, Texas has 41 copies of Ulysses, for instance.

42:58.178 --> 42:59.760
Well, that's the sort of thing.

42:59.780 --> 43:04.006
But you buy another collection, and there'll be another one in it.

43:04.026 --> 43:07.410
Well, you can make a case possibly there are differences.

43:07.430 --> 43:11.035
If there's Shakespeare's first folios, they may in fact be all different.

43:11.055 --> 43:14.700
Texas claims that Ulysses may have some...

43:15.457 --> 43:21.704
similarity with the first folio in that, because it was such a horrendous job of printing that they were very insane.

43:21.724 --> 43:22.344
Yes, exactly.

43:22.364 --> 43:22.885
Yes, it could be, you see.

43:22.905 --> 43:24.246
And some of this is another one.

43:24.266 --> 43:24.767
That's right.

43:26.389 --> 43:27.710
Which is such a great topic, too.

43:29.232 --> 43:37.561
But eventually, surely, some of those great institutional rare book libraries are going to have to start to show out a bit.

43:37.581 --> 43:39.743
Because there's so much money represented there.

43:40.077 --> 43:42.459
And what good does it do to the university?

43:42.479 --> 43:44.201
Well, isn't that what Morgan and Huntington did?

43:44.221 --> 43:47.524
They would buy, Huntington in particular, would buy on block.

43:47.565 --> 43:48.485
Exactly.

43:48.505 --> 43:49.727
He would take the best things.

43:50.608 --> 43:51.769
On a ship, though.

43:51.789 --> 43:53.190
Right, but he would take the best things.

43:53.210 --> 43:55.432
He, his people, would take the best things.

43:55.452 --> 43:58.475
And then, where there was duplication, they would sell.

43:58.495 --> 43:59.336
No, the library, not a library.

43:59.356 --> 44:02.880
That is Wellcome, the drug firm.

44:02.900 --> 44:04.281
I don't know that library.

44:04.301 --> 44:06.323
The Wellcome Library in the Euston Road.

44:06.343 --> 44:08.025
I don't know that.

44:08.765 --> 44:11.188
on science and medicine.

44:11.208 --> 44:13.311
And he bought literally by the ship boat.

44:13.331 --> 44:14.793
And where is this again?

44:14.813 --> 44:15.514
In the Eastern Road.

44:16.054 --> 44:16.635
Eastern Road.

44:17.817 --> 44:18.678
That's here?

44:18.698 --> 44:18.918
Yes.

44:19.138 --> 44:20.600
Okay.

44:20.620 --> 44:22.502
The Wellcome Library.

44:22.522 --> 44:28.170
Some, I think, has been transferred recently to the Science Museum, I'm not sure of it.

44:28.190 --> 44:31.354
But that's a very great collection of rare books on medicine and science.

44:32.055 --> 44:35.279
Well, Ian Fleming's collection in science was outstanding.

44:35.479 --> 44:36.741
That went to the Lilly Library.

44:36.761 --> 44:37.101
Exactly.

44:37.638 --> 44:45.835
Another book just out, which I ought to buy and you ought to get, is the history of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle on Time.

44:46.496 --> 44:46.596
Okay.

44:46.637 --> 44:47.097
History?

44:47.619 --> 44:56.918
Of the Literary and Philosophical Institute of Newcastle on Time, which was one of the great working men's libraries.

44:56.938 --> 44:57.098
Okay.

44:57.989 --> 44:59.291
This is available out there now?

44:59.771 --> 45:00.873
I've ordered it.

45:00.913 --> 45:02.015
I don't know where it's come yet.

45:02.035 --> 45:06.320
History of the Literary and Philosophical Institute of Newcastle and... On time.

45:06.661 --> 45:07.762
Newcastle on time.

45:09.224 --> 45:10.166
Okay.

45:11.247 --> 45:18.637
Because this was the great thing in the mid-19th century, was people lifting themselves by their bootstraps to educate themselves.

45:19.318 --> 45:25.667
And so these libraries were established, working men's libraries, for people who learned to think.

45:27.301 --> 45:30.305
The poor man's university sort of idea.

45:30.325 --> 45:34.612
And those libraries have been pillaged all over Britain.

45:34.632 --> 45:34.752
Right.

45:34.772 --> 45:35.152
Because.

45:35.533 --> 45:36.594
This is all in this book?

45:37.015 --> 45:38.798
There must be something in there.

45:39.198 --> 45:42.603
Because people would get together and say, what is the good of this old library?

45:42.623 --> 45:46.969
When what we want now is some more food machines or something for the club.

45:46.989 --> 45:47.510
And sell it.

45:49.113 --> 45:52.558
And one bookseller in England has done a great deal of buying up these.

45:53.138 --> 45:53.759
The book that he is.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.363
And that's Hang On Why.

45:56.731 --> 45:57.773
Richard Booth.

45:59.215 --> 46:00.717
Have you come across him?

46:00.797 --> 46:00.997
Yes.

46:01.218 --> 46:07.728
Perhaps the most picturesque of the book years in this country, who made himself the king of Hay-on-Wye.

46:08.088 --> 46:09.470
What is that?

46:09.490 --> 46:10.732
Richard Booth.

46:10.973 --> 46:11.654
Extraordinary chap.

46:11.694 --> 46:12.475
When do you want me to go?

46:12.875 --> 46:15.840
I think you'd better go now.

46:15.860 --> 46:16.200
Okay.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.182
There's loads of things.

46:17.202 --> 46:18.243
Can we get back together again?

46:18.384 --> 46:19.225
Yes, any time.

46:19.285 --> 46:20.026
How long are you in London?

46:20.327 --> 46:21.148
I'm leaving Sunday.

46:21.428 --> 46:22.570
Need your money.

46:23.174 --> 46:50.211
I have my wife and dad is with me my little good and so they're visiting Do you have ghosts on the second floor I did a television program about that last week It is the most haunted house in London there are books on that but none of us have ever seen it And we're doing a book launch here you are of the most wonderful

46:50.495 --> 46:56.941
Bibliography that's being published tomorrow, Oxford University Press, of books by William Travellers.

46:57.401 --> 46:58.122
Really?

46:58.142 --> 47:00.744
And there's the making of a collection.

47:00.764 --> 47:02.485
So what time is this that you're doing?

47:02.525 --> 47:06.269
We're having this... I'll just give you an invitation.

47:06.929 --> 47:09.171
And are you married to a great woman?

47:09.191 --> 47:10.973
A lovely, beautiful woman.

47:10.993 --> 47:11.553
Yes.

47:11.573 --> 47:13.415
Why not bring her?

47:13.615 --> 47:18.119
Because we have book launches at Marietta's Bookstore about once every ten years.

47:18.239 --> 47:19.320
I'd love to have...

47:19.553 --> 47:24.197
But if it's black tie, I can't because I can't because I don't have a taxi anymore.

47:25.578 --> 47:29.542
Where do you want me to go?

47:29.562 --> 47:32.144
Grandfather, Grandfather, did you ask that?

47:32.164 --> 47:34.106
What was he put in the hospital before?

47:34.126 --> 47:36.688
Well, I saw a booklet downstairs that said 50 minutes.

47:36.969 --> 47:38.930
Do you have a question?

47:38.950 --> 47:42.233
Uh, so, sir, I can tell you, there's one out.

47:42.253 --> 47:44.836
That's the incredible, or, um, uh, the manual.

47:44.856 --> 47:45.036
Yes.

47:45.136 --> 47:47.238
Have you offered a problem?

47:47.278 --> 47:48.399
You're one of them?

47:48.419 --> 47:49.560
Uh, no, I, uh... Is it the one at all, then?

47:53.168 --> 48:21.724
I was out with, you know,

48:21.907 --> 48:34.887
Michael Davis is the money man.

48:35.187 --> 48:37.231
That's right, that's right, that's right.

48:37.351 --> 48:40.677
But here's something that didn't fit on the scene at all, it was a fail.

48:40.697 --> 48:50.235
Anyway, we've constructed this a lot of fantasy around, I don't assume that identity will have no more, which has a choice in names, you know.

48:50.255 --> 48:51.998
I mean, it's obviously in a scene, you know.

48:52.383 --> 49:03.796
the biography he gave in the... Well, he claims his kinship with... He doesn't exist.

49:03.876 --> 49:05.959
Is that right?

49:06.059 --> 49:08.361
Yes, yes, yes, I did.

49:08.582 --> 49:13.767
I got... I spent a whole morning working on it.

49:13.807 --> 49:14.989
I'm recreating this, okay?

49:15.730 --> 49:16.090
You're welcome.

49:16.310 --> 49:22.137
I spent a whole morning working on it, and I got a friend of ours there who assured me that the name

49:22.387 --> 49:26.432
who had no more claims for his Celtic ancestor was actually an impossible name.

49:26.452 --> 49:31.499
I mean, there wouldn't have been a Celtic king called Omore.

49:31.799 --> 49:33.601
I told you it was have no more, right?

49:33.641 --> 49:35.023
He's confirming this.

49:35.043 --> 49:35.924
It's a total fantasy.

49:36.525 --> 49:45.076
I actually, then I started barking up a very fruitless tree, which was the Aperture Foundation, which actually does exist.

49:45.296 --> 49:46.658
But they do photographic stuff.

49:46.678 --> 49:47.979
They do photographic stuff.

49:48.180 --> 49:50.082
I could find out nothing at all on his

49:50.483 --> 49:56.611
I've got a copy of his foundation.

49:56.771 --> 49:57.773
I've got everything on that.

49:58.173 --> 50:00.156
Would you like to talk?

50:00.176 --> 50:02.259
I'd love to know about it.

50:02.319 --> 50:03.320
May I talk with him?

50:03.600 --> 50:05.383
For some reason, Ed has got himself into it.

50:05.403 --> 50:09.068
And of course, where I came into this was the Queerer Library in Chicago.

50:09.328 --> 50:10.770
That was so dreadful.

50:11.257 --> 50:12.138
I know.

50:12.158 --> 50:15.901
I'm smiling because of... I'm not smiling because of that.

50:15.921 --> 50:19.785
I'm smiling because we have some things to talk about.

50:19.945 --> 50:20.265
Yeah, yeah.

50:20.285 --> 50:22.868
Well, it is great fun, the whole thing.

50:23.889 --> 50:25.210
Well, do you want to talk to it?

50:25.350 --> 50:25.810
You know what?

50:25.851 --> 50:27.672
I left my case for this in your office.

50:27.912 --> 50:28.553
Yes, come on.

50:28.573 --> 50:35.019
I want to just shut the... In a way, they invented collecting... They sort of invented it.

50:35.259 --> 50:36.641
Can I have your full name, please?

50:36.841 --> 50:37.541
Edward Maggs.

50:38.142 --> 50:39.323
You're Edward Maggs?

50:39.539 --> 50:42.604
And you're a relation to the... No, John's my father.

50:42.704 --> 50:43.545
John's your father.

50:44.767 --> 50:47.692
So you're fifth generation.

50:47.712 --> 50:49.735
So you're born into this as well.

50:49.775 --> 50:50.876
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:50.997 --> 50:55.484
I mean, you're saying that... No, not at all.

50:55.504 --> 50:57.547
It's a wonderful business.

50:57.687 --> 51:00.411
It's a great business for the generalists.

51:01.673 --> 51:01.934
Mm-hmm.

51:03.977 --> 51:04.197
Uh...

51:04.801 --> 51:07.084
Did you always know that you'd be a book leader?

51:07.445 --> 51:11.731
No, I assumed I wouldn't be.

51:12.191 --> 51:16.978
And I tried quite hard and ended up managing and playing in it and trying to avoid it.

51:16.998 --> 51:17.819
But it was just like anything.

51:17.839 --> 51:20.643
Do you always remember books?

51:20.683 --> 51:22.105
Did you always have a reverence for books?

51:22.526 --> 51:24.409
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

51:24.489 --> 51:27.933
As your father said, the first thing you learned is don't put a T-cap on the book.

51:28.134 --> 51:32.640
That's right, that's right.

51:32.660 --> 51:34.723
I just bought the cover when he opened the book.

51:34.906 --> 51:36.698
I'm going to turn this on the other side.
