WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:03.228
All right, we're back on.

00:03.428 --> 00:06.251
All right.

00:06.271 --> 00:08.713
And I'm going to ask you a couple of factual questions.

00:08.733 --> 00:13.957
Wait, I decided I wanted to be a nurse, and then I went to... I had been in the van, and I... Oh, no!

00:13.977 --> 00:15.278
No, I wasn't in the van.

00:15.438 --> 00:20.463
I was an actress at the Brave New Workshop in Minneapolis.

00:20.483 --> 00:27.389
And it was satirical improvisational theater, and it was the antithesis of everything that I had.

00:27.489 --> 00:28.289
You're a single woman at this time.

00:28.309 --> 00:29.010
All it did was... Yes.

00:29.030 --> 00:29.230
All right.

00:29.330 --> 00:29.931
Was I ever.

00:30.471 --> 00:31.472
All...

00:31.823 --> 00:33.887
All I did was make fun of things.

00:34.188 --> 00:35.811
And that's not how I am.

00:36.292 --> 00:37.935
It's really the opposite of how I am.

00:37.955 --> 00:41.622
And it took a terrible psychic toll and I just quit doing it.

00:41.642 --> 00:45.690
And I went to California and I had decided I wanted to be a nurse.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.355
Now had you graduated from any of these schools?

00:48.456 --> 00:50.760
No, I was a dropout.

00:51.517 --> 00:53.099
Well, I felt like it.

00:53.119 --> 00:58.166
If I wasn't tired, I was very upset.

00:58.206 --> 01:02.151
So I lived in this crummy apartment.

01:02.171 --> 01:03.293
It was truly crummy.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.656
We're out in Berkeley now.

01:05.877 --> 01:07.439
I was living in Minneapolis.

01:07.579 --> 01:09.101
I had just quit being an actress.

01:09.241 --> 01:10.783
I heard someone upstairs.

01:10.803 --> 01:12.486
Did you have any acting roles, by the way?

01:12.526 --> 01:13.947
It's a very important story, Nick.

01:13.968 --> 01:15.610
Now, you better pay attention.

01:15.630 --> 01:16.271
I'm paying attention.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.013
I was a very good actress.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.902
Well, I mean, did you actually act, though?

01:19.922 --> 01:22.527
Yes, I was in this troupe.

01:22.547 --> 01:24.231
It was an improvisational theater.

01:24.331 --> 01:27.437
You call Minneapolis and ask him about the Great New York chapter, it's a very big deal.

01:27.578 --> 01:28.319
Very big deal.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.143
I'm so surprised I never heard.

01:30.163 --> 01:37.318
Anyway, so I was lying in bed listening to somebody throw up.

01:37.906 --> 01:40.709
And he found it so sick.

01:40.849 --> 01:42.451
It was a bad kind of throwing up.

01:42.471 --> 01:45.034
It wasn't the get in there and get it over with kind of throwing up.

01:45.054 --> 01:46.515
It was a gut-wrenching kind of throw.

01:46.896 --> 01:56.045
And my impulse was not one of annoyance because he was waking me up at 3 o'clock in the morning.

01:56.126 --> 02:01.411
I wanted nothing more than to go up there and say, can I help you?

02:01.431 --> 02:03.053
I felt so sad for him.

02:03.488 --> 02:06.097
And I decided I wanted to be a nurse.

02:06.238 --> 02:11.777
I decided that what was biggest in me was that need to

02:12.061 --> 02:14.784
to be compassionate and to help people.

02:14.804 --> 02:16.807
I really, really want to do it.

02:17.007 --> 02:22.694
And I also felt like when people are sick, there's just no bullshit going on.

02:22.714 --> 02:33.487
You know, they are really, truly themselves, especially when they're critically ill, which is what drew me to critical care, was that there was no bullshit going on anymore.

02:33.507 --> 02:37.432
And you could really... Can we use that word?

02:37.472 --> 02:39.013
Do you mind if we use that word, by the way?

02:39.033 --> 02:39.774
Is that bullshit?

02:39.794 --> 02:39.995
Yeah.

02:40.095 --> 02:41.116
God, I don't care.

02:41.136 --> 02:42.017
Okay, all right.

02:42.908 --> 02:56.090
And the feeling that you get pulling somebody through a critical illness or seeing somebody walk out of there is like Noah.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.834
There's nothing, nothing better.

02:58.854 --> 03:00.878
I don't care if you get two good reviews in a row.

03:01.338 --> 03:03.061
I don't care if your book sells a million copies.

03:03.081 --> 03:09.692
There's nothing that comes close to touching that one life in that most intimate of ways of seeing somebody

03:10.195 --> 03:11.297
It's incredible.

03:11.517 --> 03:25.377
Anyway, and similarly, sort of, when you're 28 years old and you take care of somebody who's 28 years old, there's nothing like that either.

03:25.817 --> 03:27.239
There's nothing like that.

03:27.259 --> 03:36.152
It's funny, the doctor who delivered our first child had been for some time an oncologist, a young guy.

03:36.638 --> 03:42.567
So that was a pertinent point, wasn't it?

03:42.587 --> 03:50.459
Yeah, and there's a couple of ways to look at that kind of thing, and I think the difference is most manifest when you talk.

03:50.759 --> 03:57.109
I don't know if you've ever had the chance to talk to hospice people, but they're the ones who really get it.

03:57.409 --> 03:59.372
They're the ones who aren't afraid.

03:59.808 --> 04:06.718
to be with people who are dying and who really find so much fulfillment and so much positive life force and that kind of thing.

04:07.018 --> 04:13.467
I asked an oncologist once who was giving me a lecture about something, how he dealt with the sadness.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.649
And he wouldn't talk about it.

04:14.709 --> 04:15.971
He said, it's hard sometimes.

04:16.191 --> 04:17.172
Next.

04:17.192 --> 04:21.018
So, you know, and I thought, that guy's not going to last in oncology.

04:21.378 --> 04:22.239
So, anyway.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.063
So there is a degree of humanity that's essential then.

04:25.684 --> 04:26.946
I think you have to have

04:27.196 --> 04:32.642
I think it's unbearable unless you have a certain kind of attitude.

04:33.783 --> 04:49.660
Grounded, I think, mostly in understanding that you're not exactly permanent yourself and that there are ways to leave that are noble and open and loving and there are ways to leave this life that are full of denial and pain and regret.

04:49.900 --> 04:55.566
And that's perhaps the greatest lesson that we ever learn is that

04:56.086 --> 04:59.215
to try to orient yourself toward that kind of closure.

04:59.235 --> 05:00.037
I mean, who knows?

05:00.057 --> 05:00.478
Whatever.

05:00.498 --> 05:04.870
Now, to answer the question briefly, where did you finally train to be a nurse?

05:05.412 --> 05:05.592
St.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.057
Mary's Junior College in Minneapolis.

05:07.077 --> 05:07.558
Oh, so you did.

05:08.059 --> 05:09.403
But you told me you didn't finish.

05:09.923 --> 05:10.264
No.

05:10.584 --> 05:13.328
I didn't finish the University of Minnesota.

05:13.408 --> 05:14.009
I dropped out.

05:14.089 --> 05:15.071
I went to California.

05:15.171 --> 05:16.113
I wanted to be a nurse.

05:16.213 --> 05:19.838
I went to Merritt Junior College in California, which is where I put a fortune in.

05:19.858 --> 05:20.419
I knew Lake Merritt.

05:20.439 --> 05:21.401
It's right on Oakland.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.342
I know what that is.

05:22.362 --> 05:23.945
After they moved to the fancy campuses.

05:23.965 --> 05:29.553
The old campuses in the city, and then Bobby Seale and Huey Newton were walking around saying, you know.

05:29.573 --> 05:30.174
That's it.

05:30.194 --> 05:32.758
And I went to class like a good little white girl.

05:32.798 --> 05:33.399
What an idiot.

05:33.419 --> 05:34.221
I was the only one.

05:34.301 --> 05:37.686
Everybody was on strike, and I was saying, are we going to have math class today?

05:37.835 --> 05:43.802
But, yeah, so I started, I took classes there, but I didn't get into nursing school.

05:43.822 --> 05:53.613
Then I came back to Minnesota, and I wanted to hurry up and get my RN, and the fastest way to get an RN was to go to a two-year school, so I did that.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.036
Do you remember what year that was that you finished?

05:57.317 --> 05:58.118
You must.

05:58.138 --> 05:58.438
74.

05:58.739 --> 05:59.740
Okay.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.364
So you actually were a nurse for a good 12 years then?

06:03.384 --> 06:07.048
Yeah, I've practiced as a nurse for over 10 years.

06:07.248 --> 06:12.935
See how I finally got to that?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.478
Then you know what comes.

06:14.518 --> 06:17.942
The factual question comes an hour and a half later.

06:17.962 --> 06:18.923
We did very well.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.567
It's very Socratic.

06:21.587 --> 06:23.449
It's all embroidered and everything.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.472
Good stuff, good stuff.

06:26.273 --> 06:26.593
All right.

06:27.314 --> 06:28.095
This is very good.

06:28.135 --> 06:30.198
Now we can get down to the writing.

06:32.201 --> 06:33.863
Would you say the writing?

06:34.889 --> 06:40.316
of your second novel was a therapeutic exercise as a response to what you were going through.

06:41.117 --> 06:45.382
I mean, given, and also the fact that you lost a friend from breast cancer.

06:45.523 --> 06:46.384
Yeah.

06:46.684 --> 06:49.327
It was such a huge event.

06:49.347 --> 06:50.789
Look at all the notes I took for this interview.

06:50.829 --> 06:52.411
I haven't referred to any of them yet.

06:52.431 --> 06:54.113
Isn't that how it goes?

06:54.454 --> 06:54.714
Yeah.

06:54.754 --> 06:55.635
Well, that's how you know.

06:55.736 --> 06:58.819
That's like when you outline a book and then you say, okay, that's that.

06:58.840 --> 06:59.220
You never use it.

06:59.240 --> 06:59.420
Exactly.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.402
Then you know you've got the good job.

07:00.422 --> 07:01.323
I didn't outline my whole book.

07:01.343 --> 07:04.727
The book that I wrote had 250,000 words.

07:04.943 --> 07:05.705
Honest to God.

07:05.886 --> 07:09.637
I mean, I never outline a single chapter.

07:10.159 --> 07:10.320
Good.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.022
I absolutely look forward to it.

07:11.042 --> 07:13.048
And there's pieces that won't be outlined at all.

07:13.068 --> 07:16.017
This piece will be, we'll sit down, whatever the lead is.

07:16.402 --> 07:21.307
Whatever I feel, I enter the piece, and then it goes where it has to go.

07:21.427 --> 07:22.528
Exactly.

07:22.708 --> 07:26.512
Now I'm blabbing, and I'm going to be so furious when I listen to this.

07:27.073 --> 07:30.316
If you're listening to this, all I have to say is you're absolutely right.

07:30.356 --> 07:31.737
The man will not shut up.

07:31.778 --> 07:32.438
Blabber mode.

07:33.659 --> 07:35.641
It goes like this to me.

07:36.062 --> 07:37.784
Anyway, look.

07:37.804 --> 07:40.466
Here is this beautiful woman.

07:40.626 --> 07:46.172
We have a picture of her in the house, and isn't she a

07:46.507 --> 07:48.029
What a gorgeous picture.

07:48.389 --> 07:48.990
She's lovely.

07:49.951 --> 07:51.193
Tony King took that picture.

07:51.213 --> 07:52.154
You certainly know him.

07:52.174 --> 07:53.395
Tony's a very good friend of mine.

07:53.415 --> 07:55.558
Ask him about Gretchen Miller.

07:55.578 --> 07:57.160
Don't use her name on the interview.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.742
I won't.

07:58.902 --> 08:00.944
But a lovely, we can say, photograph.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.526
You have a photograph of this as a lovely woman.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.568
Yeah, yeah.

08:03.748 --> 08:04.969
Tony's very, you know Tony?

08:05.009 --> 08:06.271
Tony's a very good friend of mine.

08:06.972 --> 08:09.214
I think he is amazing.

08:09.755 --> 08:10.776
I want to marry him.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.278
I would leave my husband

08:12.764 --> 08:13.525
Just like that.

08:15.969 --> 08:19.415
Yeah, I know him because of Brady, because she brought me to his slideshows.

08:19.575 --> 08:26.066
And not only are his photographs extraordinary, but his narrative is even more... Yeah, I lived in Southbrook too.

08:26.426 --> 08:29.451
That's what I said, you lived in Southbrook, so you were neighbors.

08:29.471 --> 08:31.475
Yeah, but his narrative is extraordinary.

08:31.635 --> 08:35.822
When he's showing you those pictures, what he says makes all the girls just faint.

08:35.842 --> 08:37.585
Al just goes, oh, yes you can.

08:38.386 --> 08:39.548
Anyway, so...

08:40.523 --> 08:48.793
So when this happened, I just needed to do something with all these feelings.

08:49.033 --> 08:54.740
And it's horrible that she died, and I still miss her, and I still go to call her.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.744
I still think I'm going to call her to go with me somewhere.

08:58.764 --> 09:01.688
She was a contemporary, same approximate age.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.171
Yeah, she was gorgeous.

09:04.251 --> 09:05.593
She was really funny.

09:05.673 --> 09:06.834
She was so lively.

09:06.874 --> 09:08.556
She was up for anything all the time.

09:09.312 --> 09:11.395
She was much like Ruth in that respect.

09:11.415 --> 09:16.824
The way that she was not like Ruth is what I already told you in terms of accepting and all that stuff.

09:16.884 --> 09:22.213
She said, I think I didn't get around to telling you, probably because you interrupted me.

09:22.654 --> 09:30.747
But anyway, on the day she went to get, she had just, it just kept being worse and worse and worse and worse.

09:32.190 --> 09:36.096
She went to get chemotherapy again, but first they were going to do a

09:36.953 --> 09:38.975
a chest x-ray and a CAT scan.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.659
And so they did that and it was everywhere.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.562
And there was no point in doing chemotherapy.

09:45.582 --> 09:48.645
He told her, I'm not going to do it.

09:48.665 --> 09:49.566
How old was she?

09:50.186 --> 09:51.107
She was 44.

09:53.710 --> 09:56.172
And I'm not going to do any, there's no point.

09:56.212 --> 09:56.933
I'm not going to do this.

09:57.033 --> 10:00.717
And she said, there's nothing you can do, John.

10:01.357 --> 10:02.198
And he said, no.

10:02.358 --> 10:03.760
And she said, well, I'm not going to die.

10:03.880 --> 10:04.420
I'm not.

10:05.522 --> 10:05.982
And he just

10:06.991 --> 10:08.132
didn't say anything.

10:08.152 --> 10:11.236
I mean, she just would not.

10:11.336 --> 10:21.609
She, ironically enough, did arrange for her funeral, and she wrote something for her funeral, at my suggestion.

10:21.669 --> 10:32.503
The first line of what she wrote at her funeral, and this will tell you what she was like, said to her assembled friends and relatives, well, I guess you're all as surprised to be here as I am.

10:32.543 --> 10:35.226
Who read it?

10:35.763 --> 10:37.925
The guy who did the service.

10:39.707 --> 10:45.072
Anyway, so it was really horrible, but it was... Do you remember what year she died?

10:45.873 --> 10:47.114
It was three years ago.

10:47.594 --> 10:52.579
But it was horrible, but it was also sort of wonderful in May 8th.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.383
So it was really contemporaneous with the writing of this book then?

10:56.403 --> 10:59.466
I wrote it very soon after, yeah.

10:59.926 --> 11:05.652
Because I meant for this book to be a tribute to...

11:07.049 --> 11:25.598
I was so honored to be among this group of women who cared for her, who were not the people in the book.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.003
But this was a woman around here, a Massachusetts woman, is that it?

11:29.023 --> 11:35.769
Yeah, my friend lived in Massachusetts and a lot of different friends just sort of took care of her.

11:35.809 --> 11:39.513
She ended up going to her parents' house to die in the end.

11:41.054 --> 11:45.038
Not unlike the scenario here.

11:45.098 --> 11:54.387
And I did that not because it was like what happened, I did that because I think it's so typical that people

11:54.772 --> 11:58.618
when they're dying end up going back home.

11:59.739 --> 12:03.605
So was it a literary device for you to have her die off stage in that manner?

12:04.847 --> 12:07.991
I don't think of it as a literary device.

12:08.031 --> 12:22.973
I think of it as a reflection of some truth, which is that when people get to the end of the line, they very often times, particularly if they're not married, you know, if they don't have an immediate family, will go, a lot of aides, you know, who go home to their

12:23.206 --> 12:26.289
You see it in the obits all the time.

12:26.409 --> 12:26.769
Yeah.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.232
Because the New York Times tells you the cause of death.

12:29.432 --> 12:29.712
Yeah.

12:29.953 --> 12:32.435
And you'll see he lived in San Francisco.

12:32.455 --> 12:33.676
Died in Kansas.

12:33.756 --> 12:36.719
He died in Canton, Mass.

12:37.079 --> 12:37.640
That's right.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.162
And I just saw one like that a week ago.

12:40.423 --> 12:41.323
It happens all the time.

12:41.764 --> 12:46.488
And there's a very strong pull, even when you've been estranged from that family, to go back.

12:47.710 --> 12:52.234
And, you know, I could talk for hours about why that is.

12:52.518 --> 12:59.770
So it was a tribute to your friend.

12:59.850 --> 13:03.436
I mean, some of the best times, we would be laughing uproariously.

13:03.476 --> 13:04.277
She was dying.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.042
We would all be laughing and I would think, what is this?

13:07.102 --> 13:08.604
How can this be?

13:08.764 --> 13:14.454
And so I meant it first and foremost to be a tribute to female friendship.

13:15.355 --> 13:18.981
Secondly, and a close second, I wanted to

13:19.501 --> 13:28.198
call attention to breast cancer in a very personal way, because there's a lot of attention paid to it, but not in this way.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.266
But you do give some statistics at the back of the book.

13:32.286 --> 13:33.087
That's right.

13:33.208 --> 13:36.795
And you also, I guess, gave a percentage of your royalties.

13:36.855 --> 13:38.598
Yeah, right.

13:38.678 --> 13:40.682
National Breast Cancer Academy.

13:41.118 --> 13:45.363
And it was on Oprah, you know, I was really... Did you go on Oprah?

13:45.544 --> 13:45.824
Yeah.

13:47.206 --> 13:48.908
And I was... That's supposed to be the best thing I could ever do.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.390
Well, but you know what?

13:50.931 --> 14:04.628
It was a show of... I mean, I was gratified and, you know, and it put the book on the PW list, but what I... Honestly, what I cared about that show was that the whole show was on breast cancer.

14:05.047 --> 14:13.360
And it got the message out to a lot of people about how little research is being done, about how many women are dying from breast cancer, and so on and so on.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.462
Susan Love was on there.

14:15.002 --> 14:30.126
Women who, it's a very moving show, I'm telling you, you should watch it, because the people who opened the show were women who were in the terminal stages of breast cancer, talking about how they're dealing with this, talking about how, you know,

14:30.511 --> 14:35.057
It was heartbreaking, but very effective.

14:35.358 --> 14:45.211
And that's one of the reasons I wrote the book, was to say, listen, we need to pay attention to this, because not enough is happening in terms of research.

14:45.351 --> 14:52.781
Now let's talk also about the support group in Talk Before Sleep.

14:52.801 --> 14:59.169
I mean, the women who, clearly this is something you wanted to write about as well, I think.

14:59.270 --> 14:59.590
Yeah.

15:00.802 --> 15:06.992
I mean a lot of the reviews, I mean I got this packet of reviews that Randolph R. sent me, you know, all the reviews of this book.

15:09.195 --> 15:25.982
You know, the women band together, I mean if you're looking for a line about how these women close ranks to help a friend through this crisis, I guess that was something that you wanted to talk about too, I guess the power of friendship and the power of relationship.

15:26.165 --> 15:32.071
you know, that some things can be so strong that they will carry you through anything.

15:32.751 --> 15:54.653
And also that there's, I think that there's a unique quality to men's friendships, but I'm not a man and I'm not in it and I don't know about it, but I do know about women's friendships and it's one of the best things in my life, you know, and I, one of the best things that happened with this book was going around on tour and there would be all different kinds of women who would come up to me and say,

15:54.818 --> 16:19.594
And I mean everything from women who weighed, you know, 300 pounds and had these huge, you know, like bowling outfits, and they'd say, I've been hanging out with Sally for 35 years, and we go out every Thursday, to diminutive, beautiful little, you know, little girl women who had just been away from their homes, you know, had just had their first apartment for

16:20.148 --> 16:49.885
a year, and they were so, their friends were so valuable to them, and you know, over and over, this was their testimonies, and of course, also people who had friends who had breast cancer, or who themselves had breast cancer, and so it was pretty, I don't think that, I don't know that anybody could do her justice in terms of, she was such a hot ticket, she really was, and

16:50.135 --> 16:55.403
And I wanted to fictionalize it, and so it's not... I mean, you know, I wrote a couple of non-fiction articles about her.

16:55.443 --> 16:57.025
Did you identify her?

16:58.067 --> 16:58.547
Yeah.

16:58.728 --> 16:59.349
Did you identify her?

16:59.769 --> 17:00.450
I mean, by name?

17:00.931 --> 17:01.131
No.

17:01.432 --> 17:07.000
I showed her the article I wrote about going to get... If you remember, there's a part in the book about when they go to get the wig.

17:07.941 --> 17:14.251
And that was pretty close to what happened, although I didn't call that woman a bitch, but I wish I could have.

17:16.053 --> 17:19.939
But I wrote an article for a magazine about that, about how...

17:20.763 --> 17:25.848
graceful my friend was, and how much herself.

17:25.868 --> 17:28.210
And I showed it to her, and she said, call me Kate.

17:28.230 --> 17:30.392
I always wanted to be named Kate.

17:30.572 --> 17:31.793
So she was called Kate.

17:32.154 --> 17:36.878
Do you have a, no, do your friends call you Elizabeth, or?

17:36.898 --> 17:37.979
Some of them do.

17:38.199 --> 17:39.420
My husband calls me Beth.

17:39.741 --> 17:40.481
Beth, okay.

17:40.501 --> 17:41.222
Yeah.

17:43.284 --> 17:46.627
Do you have a perceived audience for your free books, free writing?

17:46.747 --> 17:50.010
I mean, clearly, the magazine pieces he did was a

17:50.294 --> 18:00.313
And I have to say that all the reviews, for instance, I saw were exclusively written by women.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.917
It's interesting.

18:02.077 --> 18:03.219
Maybe there was one or two men.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.708
But I was not familiar with your work prior to this assignment.

18:07.728 --> 18:09.872
And I have to say I love this book.

18:10.274 --> 18:14.680
I was very surprised about how men took to this book, frankly.

18:14.700 --> 18:18.265
I thought men would say, oh, here's another case of man-bashing.

18:18.305 --> 18:18.966
Well, but it wasn't.

18:18.986 --> 18:21.829
But, you know, this one wasn't man-bashing.

18:22.030 --> 18:23.932
No, I love guys.

18:24.974 --> 18:28.258
Plus, she's devoted to her husband.

18:28.298 --> 18:28.939
She likes him.

18:28.959 --> 18:29.700
She misses him.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.761
Yes, she does.

18:30.841 --> 18:31.963
She wants him to come back.

18:31.983 --> 18:32.563
Yeah.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.207
Now, Ed is kind of a jerk, but he just had to find himself.

18:35.227 --> 18:36.168
Well, that's right.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.531
He's not really such a jerk.

18:38.571 --> 18:40.253
She likes him.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.534
She likes him better.

18:42.055 --> 18:48.182
I mean, I think that's a terrible anguish to live with, to know that something's wrong.

18:48.563 --> 18:51.106
Something's wrong, and you're not living... I didn't pick that up, by the way.

18:51.126 --> 18:53.048
I'm usually pretty good at picking these things.

18:53.068 --> 18:54.329
Yeah, good, good.

18:54.349 --> 18:55.671
I mean, I figured out...

18:56.242 --> 18:57.804
presumed innocent."

18:57.824 --> 18:59.826
I said, that was pretty easy.

19:01.127 --> 19:01.728
He's a friend of mine.

19:01.748 --> 19:03.429
He said, how the hell did you figure that out?

19:03.890 --> 19:05.852
I said, come on, I'm an investigative reporter.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.794
I said, the telephone calls.

19:08.214 --> 19:14.201
The guy's narrating the telephone calls from his house to the victim's house.

19:15.562 --> 19:16.303
He didn't do it.

19:16.583 --> 19:16.944
Who did?

19:17.504 --> 19:18.926
If he didn't do it, his wife did it.

19:19.086 --> 19:20.307
I didn't read it.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.110
It's hard to figure out though, isn't it?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.196
I bet it is.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.800
It is, yeah.

19:26.820 --> 19:26.920
Yeah.

19:26.940 --> 19:27.061
It is.

19:27.081 --> 19:28.202
But I didn't catch this.

19:28.763 --> 19:29.264
I should have.

19:29.504 --> 19:30.005
Oh, good.

19:30.186 --> 19:32.970
I should have, but you got me all that, especially when it goes into the house.

19:33.010 --> 19:34.212
It sounded like a woman's house.

19:34.232 --> 19:34.793
Yeah.

19:34.813 --> 19:35.374
And that was funny.

19:35.394 --> 19:37.717
That was a good scene, by the way, when you break into the house.

19:38.038 --> 19:42.785
Two ballsy women, I have to say, resting into the cell.

19:42.966 --> 19:47.112
I should take a walk with you and show you the little townhouses that I used.

19:47.413 --> 19:48.715
You know, I was thinking of those.

19:48.775 --> 19:50.177
There's a house that

19:50.579 --> 19:54.867
I think of as Laney and Alice's house on my little daily walk, too.

19:54.987 --> 19:56.009
It's a duplex.

19:56.049 --> 19:57.552
Do they have duplexes in St.

19:57.592 --> 19:57.993
Paul?

19:58.995 --> 20:03.744
Actually, what originally and prior to that duplex... Because this is really three-decker country, you know.

20:03.924 --> 20:05.608
Oh, that's my Aunt Lala's house.

20:05.668 --> 20:06.750
She lived in a duplex.

20:07.732 --> 20:12.621
Do you remember when Gloria the Nurse talks about that mean old lady that keeps kids bald?

20:13.107 --> 20:18.933
the balls I play with.

20:19.935 --> 20:24.920
Only the little boys, of course.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.386
The little kids, beach balls.

20:30.867 --> 20:41.038
Anyway, my Aunt Lala lived in this old duplex, and her neighbor was this mean old woman who, come on, shake her a little.

20:41.423 --> 20:43.625
She was a real mean old lady.

20:43.645 --> 20:47.709
But anyway, my aunt Lola's house was the inspiration for Lainey's house.

20:47.749 --> 20:54.016
But when I go for a walk now, I see a duplex and I think there's even marks for a porch swing.

20:54.636 --> 21:00.682
And the steps are there, you know, on the little narrow alleyway where the kids play out and back and all that stuff.

21:00.742 --> 21:02.324
So, yeah.

21:02.584 --> 21:04.866
And she had the old-fashioned sink and everything.

21:04.946 --> 21:06.488
I loved that house.

21:06.948 --> 21:08.090
And a pantry.

21:08.570 --> 21:09.591
Ooh, a pantry.

21:10.094 --> 21:18.743
Maybe I'm stretching here, but Talk Before Sleep is about a woman who's clearly dying.

21:20.785 --> 21:24.209
She's alert and every second is precious.

21:24.970 --> 21:30.816
Here you have a guy that's as good as dead, and he's not part of it at all.

21:30.936 --> 21:35.781
I mean he is part of it, the little italicized things that are reaching out.

21:37.533 --> 21:38.695
Nobody has no recollection.

21:38.895 --> 21:45.986
I mean, it is kind of an interesting, they're almost imagined, they're almost a companion blog.

21:46.206 --> 21:46.707
Yeah, yeah.

21:46.727 --> 21:47.468
I never thought of that.

21:47.488 --> 21:48.690
Have you thought of it that kind of thing?

21:48.750 --> 21:49.271
No, I haven't.

21:49.311 --> 21:50.533
That's interesting, isn't it?

21:50.833 --> 21:56.802
It's, you know, when I was writing short stories... So I was stretching on that, or is it just a good observation?

21:57.102 --> 21:58.485
I think it's a good observation.

21:58.545 --> 22:06.797
I don't think that it was intentional, but I don't think that anything I do in writing, almost nothing I do in writing is really intentional.

22:07.132 --> 22:16.863
When I used to write short stories I would start out with two or three things that I just felt like weaving together somehow into a story.

22:16.983 --> 22:23.892
One time I read in a nature book that they were finding decapitated birds and they couldn't account for this.

22:23.912 --> 22:28.617
They didn't know what was going on and they found out that a grackle did it.

22:28.985 --> 22:30.066
somehow.

22:30.126 --> 22:32.269
I just liked that sort of bizarre fact.

22:32.289 --> 22:34.172
And then I do this thing with license plates.

22:34.712 --> 22:43.443
When I see license plates and there's the three initials on the end, I make it be a sentence in my head, and it always tells me the state of my mind and what's going on and what I really believe.

22:43.964 --> 22:44.805
Try that sometimes.

22:44.825 --> 22:46.747
Just look at the license plate and let it be a sentence.

22:47.108 --> 22:50.672
So I put that in the story, and so I mix it all up, and there you are.

22:50.732 --> 22:54.537
It's a story that comes out with these things.

22:55.259 --> 23:02.728
range of motion, I was very much interested in the notion of what goes on when someone's in a coma, what their level of awareness is.

23:02.928 --> 23:12.540
As a person and as a nurse, too, I used to... Did you read Richard Selzer's book last year?

23:12.700 --> 23:12.800
Okay.

23:13.181 --> 23:13.682
Wait a minute.

23:13.822 --> 23:14.523
I'm getting to that.

23:15.043 --> 23:17.787
So I was very... When I was a nurse... Yes, obviously.

23:17.847 --> 23:18.788
No, I didn't read it.

23:18.988 --> 23:19.629
I didn't read it.

23:19.669 --> 23:22.212
But when I was a nurse, I...

23:23.035 --> 23:27.722
It was a very strange thing taking care of someone in a coma.

23:27.742 --> 23:37.076
It was a very charged atmosphere and I would really wonder what they could hear and what they could sense and what they were thinking and feeling and so on.

23:37.496 --> 23:43.305
And I wanted to write a book where I could represent the person in a coma's point of view.

23:43.325 --> 23:46.950
I also wanted to write about

23:47.605 --> 23:53.332
the wonderfulness of ordinary life, just how spectacular the little things are.

23:53.893 --> 23:57.798
And so those were the, you know, the ingredients.

23:58.179 --> 24:08.993
I don't want to be maudlin, but again, is this kind of born from your own recent experience, your own, and I hate to use a hackneyed phrase, your own brush with the unknown, shall we say, or uncertainty?

24:09.454 --> 24:15.942
I think that more than any other book I've ever written, Range of Motion is about cancer, is about my own.

24:16.192 --> 24:19.355
And even though it's not about cancer, it is.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.036
Right.

24:20.056 --> 24:21.377
Certainly the ending.

24:21.397 --> 24:23.940
I also think that a lot of writers... But why the ending?

24:23.960 --> 24:26.703
Because it has definitely a happy ending.

24:26.923 --> 24:45.102
The last sentence, which says that I'm listening for as long as I can and I'm listening with all of my might, I think speaks for the way that I'm trying to live my life, having had that tap.

24:45.250 --> 24:49.736
That you get clued in in a big way.

24:50.036 --> 24:52.019
Now let me tell you how I work.

24:52.039 --> 24:52.780
This is interesting.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.462
I never go into one of these interviews.

24:54.622 --> 24:55.383
I never have.

24:56.284 --> 24:58.507
I've done hundreds of them.

24:58.527 --> 25:00.209
I'm never happy until I have my lead.

25:01.611 --> 25:04.855
And also I need my kicker, which is the last one.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.699
You just gave me, I know how this story ends by the way.

25:07.719 --> 25:08.019
Oh you do?

25:08.139 --> 25:09.441
Well you just gave it to me.

25:09.841 --> 25:10.262
What?

25:11.018 --> 25:14.883
I don't know exactly how I'm going to write it.

25:14.903 --> 25:16.705
Oh, yeah.

25:16.725 --> 25:17.526
That's great.

25:17.966 --> 25:18.487
You know what I'm saying?

25:18.527 --> 25:22.411
I always like to end with, oh, wow.

25:22.592 --> 25:23.493
That's nice.

25:23.533 --> 25:25.034
That's very good.

25:25.054 --> 25:26.156
Yeah.

25:26.256 --> 25:27.818
But I realize, you know, yeah.

25:28.078 --> 25:28.879
Did you see what I'm saying?

25:29.039 --> 25:29.480
Yeah.

25:29.980 --> 25:35.727
I also think that a lot of writers write about the same thing over and over and over.

25:36.331 --> 25:45.612
It's always the same motivation, whatever theme it takes, whatever disguise it takes, that there are themes in people's lives that they want to talk about over and over.

25:45.633 --> 25:52.348
And I think that you can see that in, well, you've heard two of them, but there's always...

25:52.733 --> 26:02.071
life-affirming stuff, and there's always meatloaf, there's always meatloaf, and there always will be meatloaf in every book, ever, ever.

26:02.312 --> 26:02.953
Absolutely.

26:03.033 --> 26:04.195
It will always be there.

26:04.216 --> 26:06.520
Did you ever conceive of yourself as a long-haul driver?

26:07.622 --> 26:08.885
Yes.

26:08.905 --> 26:10.869
I want to do a non-fiction book.

26:10.889 --> 26:13.935
I want to go across country with female truck drivers.

26:13.955 --> 26:15.197
Why is it that I got that idea?

26:15.785 --> 26:25.638
I have come so very close to doing that, to going over to the Roy Rogers on 495, because a lot of truckers go in there, and picking one out.

26:26.559 --> 26:28.641
But I decided it shouldn't be all women, actually.

26:28.661 --> 26:29.623
That's my latest visit.

26:29.643 --> 26:30.564
It should not be all women.

26:30.584 --> 26:31.425
It should be a mix.

26:31.926 --> 26:38.013
And just pick one out, just eating his hamburger with his mouth closed, chewing with his mouth closed.

26:38.033 --> 26:43.240
And I would say, I know it's so bad.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.502
I have my little suitcase.

26:44.882 --> 26:45.623
I'd say, could I just

26:45.805 --> 26:48.990
kind of come and you just pretend I'm not here.

26:49.050 --> 26:50.011
Just be yourself, you know.

26:50.051 --> 26:51.794
Let me go across the country.

26:51.814 --> 26:52.895
I really want to do that.

26:53.056 --> 26:54.257
It'd be a hell of a piece.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.000
Wouldn't it be wonderful?

26:56.020 --> 26:56.861
You could sell that anywhere.

26:57.442 --> 26:58.263
I want to do it.

26:58.443 --> 27:07.476
But the one I just finished is about a woman who takes off and I did a whole, you know, I can't do it yet because my kids are still too little so I had to do it in a book.

27:07.857 --> 27:12.724
But anyway, someday truckers, oh my god, it would be so, oh, where are they, oh,

27:13.177 --> 27:18.702
Unfortunately, so many of them go to Burger King now, but you know how there used to be all those great truck stops.

27:18.842 --> 27:21.805
I went to graduate school at Penn State.

27:21.825 --> 27:25.748
I went to a little college at the main Bates, and I went from one totally extreme to the other.

27:25.768 --> 27:26.649
Oh, that's a great school, yeah.

27:26.669 --> 27:26.949
High school.

27:27.870 --> 27:31.113
But I remember driving out, there were always these diners.

27:31.773 --> 27:32.974
Zimmy's Diner.

27:32.994 --> 27:33.175
Yeah.

27:33.575 --> 27:35.297
Zimmy's Diner was the best.

27:35.317 --> 27:37.639
I can think of thinking it was 30 years after the fact.

27:37.659 --> 27:42.643
You would go in and get, for one buck, of course this is the 60s, for one dollar you'd get

27:42.978 --> 27:47.123
You get ham and eggs, home fries, and a piece of ham would be like.

27:47.143 --> 27:47.704
Oh my God.

27:47.864 --> 27:53.412
And I dream to this day of Jimmy's dinner, truck stuff, and there were plenty of them on Route 20.

27:53.892 --> 28:01.402
You know, good, basic, straightforward American food, very generous portions.

28:01.643 --> 28:02.964
And that's kind of the place we're talking about.

28:02.984 --> 28:11.095
There is one that I used for, you know, there's one, I have to ask Howard.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.625
It has the special room for the professional drivers only.

28:15.045 --> 28:19.772
And then it has a smorgasbord of all horrible food that they love so much.

28:19.813 --> 28:22.797
Kind of like the frequent flyers club, right?

28:22.817 --> 28:22.937
Yeah.

28:22.977 --> 28:24.960
They need to get in there and get out.

28:24.980 --> 28:27.083
They're on a schedule, you know, and they have showers.

28:27.144 --> 28:28.826
Indian Head, your shower is ready.

28:29.046 --> 28:32.371
Then they have a smorgasbord, of course, all the food that I love.

28:32.391 --> 28:35.456
Macaroni and cheese and tacos and meatloaf.

28:35.576 --> 28:36.438
I love Fourth of July.

28:36.458 --> 28:38.921
This is where we're going to have lots of potato salad.

28:39.122 --> 28:40.103
Oh, oh.

28:40.522 --> 28:43.767
And then a whole dessert cart and everything.

28:43.807 --> 28:49.957
And then they have the store attached to it with the chains and the leather jackets and the things for trucks that you don't know what they are.

28:49.997 --> 28:51.800
And beef jerky.

28:51.900 --> 28:53.763
Can I just give you a cautionary word?

28:53.783 --> 28:59.633
I mean the truckers, the things they write are the bedroom walls when they stop.

28:59.873 --> 29:01.095
Yeah, I know.

29:01.784 --> 29:03.206
That's why I thought I'd go with women.

29:03.546 --> 29:06.009
That's why I thought I'd go with women.

29:06.210 --> 29:06.790
I know.

29:07.311 --> 29:07.992
I know.

29:08.352 --> 29:11.035
But you have to get some weird ones or it wouldn't be any fun.

29:11.176 --> 29:13.118
I know.

29:13.138 --> 29:14.119
It's not going to happen to us.

29:14.139 --> 29:14.880
Alone on the road.

29:16.302 --> 29:18.204
Your husband will know what you do.

29:18.405 --> 29:20.067
Oh, he thinks it's a great idea.

29:20.107 --> 29:20.527
He does?

29:20.587 --> 29:24.332
Yeah.

29:24.970 --> 29:28.834
But whether, you know, if I were really going to do it, I don't know if he's doing it.

29:28.954 --> 29:39.106
So tell me then... Anyway, you can go to that place, because it's in Connecticut, that truck stop, where they have the beef jerky and the chains and all that.

29:39.126 --> 29:41.669
Do you remember where in Connecticut it is?

29:41.689 --> 29:42.710
I think it's still here.

29:44.051 --> 29:44.672
Howard?

29:45.633 --> 29:46.574
Oh, thank you.

29:48.136 --> 29:54.623
Where's that truck stop that, you know, that has the smorgasbord and the store with all that stuff?

29:55.396 --> 30:06.892
Do you know that truck stuff we go to that has a smorgasbord and the attachment?

30:06.912 --> 30:07.173
It's on 1884.

30:07.193 --> 30:07.733
Do you know the name of it?

30:07.753 --> 30:08.494
I know where that is.

30:09.336 --> 30:11.078
The 76th station in 1884.

30:11.438 --> 30:13.962
It's right about where I got my speeding ticket the other day.

30:15.604 --> 30:19.670
You're going to go there.

30:19.710 --> 30:21.352
What the hell are they talking about up there?

30:21.893 --> 30:22.594
Go hungry.

30:23.616 --> 30:24.677
Okay.

30:27.273 --> 30:33.161
Unfortunately, I'm extremely happy with both my agency and the public.

30:33.201 --> 30:35.665
They're interested in dedications and acknowledgments.

30:36.066 --> 30:41.994
If there's anything revealing there, I don't see anything of any particularly revelatory nature from this stuff.

30:42.014 --> 30:48.463
Your work habits, you write at home here on the second floor, and I would gather on this word processor over here.

30:48.483 --> 30:49.505
Do you write longhand?

30:49.525 --> 30:52.669
Do you do stuff pretty much straight on the... Magic wand.

30:53.510 --> 30:54.672
Ah.

30:54.772 --> 30:55.373
What is that?

30:55.859 --> 30:56.720
It's a magic wine.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.342
It's a magic wine.

30:58.362 --> 31:00.244
It's a Native American thing.

31:00.264 --> 31:01.205
Tell me what it is.

31:01.225 --> 31:01.946
I don't know.

31:02.006 --> 31:03.368
It's stones.

31:03.708 --> 31:04.189
Yeah.

31:04.910 --> 31:05.691
I like rocks.

31:06.431 --> 31:06.912
I gather.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.274
We have stones here.

31:08.294 --> 31:09.295
We have a lovely shelf.

31:09.575 --> 31:12.759
Anyway, so I just saw this thing.

31:12.779 --> 31:14.381
It's called a magic wine.

31:14.521 --> 31:16.844
I thought this would be a good place to play.

31:17.004 --> 31:18.726
Yeah, I don't write one.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.408
I don't write one on this guy.

31:20.828 --> 31:23.031
Tell me about the Tuesday morning writing group.

31:23.416 --> 31:25.518
You should come to that.

31:25.599 --> 31:28.001
You would have such a good time.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.723
You really should.

31:29.984 --> 31:31.025
Maybe I will.

31:35.130 --> 31:43.259
When I very first started writing, I thought, you know, I told things, but I thought, well, maybe I should find out what I'm doing.

31:43.279 --> 31:49.486
So I took a couple classes, one of which was at the Harvard Extension, I think it was writing fiction class.

31:49.506 --> 31:50.908
I mean, Sally Brady taught it.

31:51.530 --> 31:55.756
And Sally was immediately responsive to my work.

31:56.297 --> 32:03.186
And she said, she wanted me to join this sort of private writing book that she had.

32:03.246 --> 32:03.727
So I did.

32:03.747 --> 32:07.552
And that was, oh my God, I think that was like nine years ago or something.

32:08.253 --> 32:09.174
Eight or nine years ago.

32:09.635 --> 32:18.527
And so I've been pretty much doing that with minor breaks for eight or nine years.

32:18.627 --> 32:19.849
And we meet every...

32:20.302 --> 32:35.681
you know, once a week, it used to be on Wednesday, now it's Tuesday, and we go to Sally's house, which is this beautiful, beautiful place in Bedford, and there are horses out in her backyard, and she has a beautiful garden and flowers all over the place.

32:35.701 --> 32:40.967
In fact, she put that garden in the, come here, look at this, look at this garden.

32:40.987 --> 32:41.948
I hired her.

32:42.389 --> 32:46.194
I said, give me one of those gardens, and she put that.

32:46.374 --> 32:47.515
Oh, isn't that nice?

32:47.535 --> 32:48.216
Oh, it's just

32:53.967 --> 32:56.458
Nice doves out there, some morning doves.

32:56.478 --> 32:59.692
Yeah, the cardinals come and stay here all the time.

33:00.174 --> 33:04.011
Anyway, so it's, and what we do is,

33:04.312 --> 33:21.661
Everybody reads every time, although you don't read your own work, Sally reads it, and then you can hear how it sounds, which is pretty valuable, because it's one thing to write it, but then even when you speak it yourself into a tape recorder, I don't know if you do that, but you pick up things listening to it.

33:21.681 --> 33:22.162
I do read stuff a lot.

33:22.182 --> 33:24.746
I read stuff to my wife, actually, I have to say out loud.

33:24.766 --> 33:26.208
Yeah, that's nice.

33:26.469 --> 33:28.412
And she has a good ear, too.

33:28.679 --> 33:31.483
And you hear things that you didn't notice when you write.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.405
So anyway, she reads everybody's work.

33:33.425 --> 33:37.311
We're supposed to only bring ten pages, but some of us are pigs like me.

33:37.371 --> 33:42.718
And we say, well, I have 15, well, I have 20, but there's a lot of dialogue.

33:42.738 --> 33:48.005
So I tend to bring more, but I have to cut it up.

33:48.886 --> 33:54.814
And then we chat, you know, about what we all think.

33:54.894 --> 33:55.335
Here it is.

33:55.475 --> 33:56.737
Here's the group.

33:57.177 --> 33:58.399
Minus Rick...

33:58.649 --> 34:01.732
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

34:01.832 --> 34:03.673
There's eight women here.

34:03.994 --> 34:05.015
And there's Sally.

34:06.416 --> 34:08.898
Oh, she's just the greatest.

34:09.499 --> 34:11.180
It's a nice picture, actually, isn't it?

34:11.200 --> 34:11.680
Yeah.

34:11.700 --> 34:14.183
We went on a retreat to Nashana.

34:14.203 --> 34:17.005
It was just an island.

34:17.566 --> 34:20.929
I don't usually like those things, but I have to say it was pretty nice.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.452
So that's where this was taken.

34:24.472 --> 34:27.154
Anyway, so Sally's a great reader.

34:28.703 --> 34:32.990
And it's a very thoughtful... Sally, did you give me her full name?

34:33.411 --> 34:34.012
Brady.

34:34.032 --> 34:34.633
Brady.

34:34.653 --> 34:35.655
And she lives in Bedford.

34:35.675 --> 34:36.536
She lives in Bedford.

34:36.556 --> 34:37.578
She's a writer herself.

34:37.598 --> 34:38.640
She's also an agent.

34:38.780 --> 34:42.326
And her husband is Upton Brady, who used to be the Atlantic Monthly Press.

34:42.346 --> 34:45.632
And he's now an agent as well.

34:46.313 --> 34:48.176
And so we laugh a lot.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.959
We eat great food.

34:49.979 --> 34:50.560
Great food.

34:51.029 --> 34:53.993
And we drink tons of coffee, so we all talk way too much of talking.

34:54.013 --> 34:56.135
You sit right in.

34:56.376 --> 34:58.498
And then, you know, that's it.

34:58.718 --> 35:08.410
And I've done, you know, they were the ones, changing memories, but you know, Sally has heard durable goods from page one all the way through.

35:08.731 --> 35:09.332
And do they help?

35:10.313 --> 35:11.594
Oh, yeah.

35:11.614 --> 35:12.916
Do they offer good?

35:12.936 --> 35:13.577
They're great.

35:14.438 --> 35:15.359
They're great.

35:15.399 --> 35:16.260
Yeah.

35:17.152 --> 35:19.715
I know it's also in range of motion.

35:19.735 --> 35:30.867
Let me just say too that I could write in isolation in terms of I don't feel like what I get from that group saves my writing.

35:30.887 --> 35:34.111
I think they make wonderful points and they catch things.

35:34.191 --> 35:35.252
But I would write it.

35:35.272 --> 35:40.258
But the thing that means the most to me about that group is the friendship.

35:41.619 --> 35:45.083
Otherwise I'd be by myself all the time and I'd be talking to

35:45.400 --> 35:47.602
It is good to get out.

35:47.963 --> 35:50.145
Yeah, so it gets me out.

35:50.525 --> 35:58.033
When we go to take the trash, when I was in the middle of writing, my wife would believe I really looked forward to the ride down to the dump.

35:58.694 --> 35:59.574
Yeah, you have to clear your head.

35:59.595 --> 36:01.056
I love getting out to the post office.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.798
Well, the dump is a good thing now.

36:02.898 --> 36:04.780
I mean, you know, you're talking a good thing.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.261
Do you get to dump the Bibles?

36:06.281 --> 36:08.043
All that stuff, yeah.

36:08.063 --> 36:08.924
There you are.

36:09.024 --> 36:11.847
Get to hear them crash, yeah.

36:12.569 --> 36:14.231
But yeah, you have to get out.

36:15.393 --> 36:21.340
I like also the fact that in these two novels, and do you see them as novels or novellas, by the way, in your mind?

36:22.321 --> 36:28.629
Would you say you're writing... Well, I mean, how do you decide?

36:28.649 --> 36:32.914
Is it page count or is it content or is it emotional resonance?

36:32.975 --> 36:38.121
I mean, let's call them little novels because I think...

36:40.042 --> 36:49.211
I like to think, anyway, that there's a little more to them than the word novella might suggest, although there are, of course, fabulous novellas.

36:50.612 --> 36:52.234
Like, you know, The Age of Grief.

36:52.454 --> 36:53.675
The Age of Grief, you know.

36:53.855 --> 36:55.457
The Old Man in the Sea wasn't bad.

36:55.937 --> 36:56.638
Wasn't bad.

36:57.398 --> 36:58.159
Wasn't bad.

36:58.540 --> 37:02.183
He should have gone to a truck stop before he went out on the ocean, though.

37:02.203 --> 37:03.464
Would have vastly improved it.

37:03.544 --> 37:04.025
No.

37:04.145 --> 37:04.805
Yeah, exactly.

37:04.846 --> 37:06.907
But I guess, you know.

37:08.229 --> 37:09.610
That's fine.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.526
I mean, I think it's a good thing.

37:13.546 --> 37:15.469
I think it's a good thing.

37:15.890 --> 37:18.994
It's a good thing.

37:20.096 --> 37:23.601
It's a good thing.

37:23.701 --> 37:27.126
It's a good thing.

37:27.426 --> 37:30.471
It's a good thing.

37:30.831 --> 37:34.737
It's a good thing.

37:35.459 --> 37:45.971
the permissiveness of it, you know, the knowledge that you can say whatever you want is, um, that's not, I don't think any dialogue's been actually lifted from.

37:47.793 --> 37:51.037
I'm trying to think.

37:51.057 --> 38:05.213
Um, Alice was born, so to speak, because a very good friend of mine was talking about a woman who he'd seen who was pretty spectacularly unattractive, I mean, amazingly unattractive, and he said, but you know,

38:06.728 --> 38:11.893
I looked at her again, and she didn't seem unattractive.

38:11.933 --> 38:14.796
She just seemed so strong.

38:15.096 --> 38:20.982
So I thought, oh, I like the notion of that.

38:21.002 --> 38:23.144
She gets her reward in the end, too, doesn't she?

38:23.184 --> 38:23.404
Sure.

38:23.505 --> 38:28.329
After a visit.

38:28.730 --> 38:30.672
I love those smart guys.

38:32.594 --> 38:36.077
And she seems content in the relationship, too, which is important.

38:36.428 --> 38:39.872
Have I missed anything, do you think?

38:39.892 --> 38:41.214
Do you think I've pretty much covered it?

38:42.315 --> 38:53.428
Can you think of anything that you'd like to tell me that I haven't... Okay, when I went to the dentist in Newton the first time, I had to fill out the form, you know, the health form, and all that.

38:53.948 --> 38:55.490
How do you prefer to be addressed?

38:56.511 --> 38:56.571
Me?

38:56.591 --> 38:58.233
No, that's what I said on the form.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.256
Because, you know, I'm a doctor.

39:00.276 --> 39:01.477
And I put, Your Highness.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.140
So, you might want to just...

39:04.323 --> 39:07.288
Keep that in mind.

39:07.308 --> 39:07.869
I'm kidding!

39:07.889 --> 39:08.490
I'm kidding!

39:09.311 --> 39:12.136
No, I don't think there's... I mean, that's a true story.

39:12.396 --> 39:13.498
He's a wonderful dentist.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.882
He kisses your forehead when you leave.

39:16.543 --> 39:18.406
I don't think so.

39:18.587 --> 39:23.715
I think we've got... You do have a great deal of respect for your reader.

39:24.910 --> 39:25.871
Yes, I do.

39:25.891 --> 39:29.196
The people that you don't see, but the people you know who are out there.

39:29.576 --> 39:29.797
Yeah.

39:29.817 --> 39:32.060
Because you do address them in your books.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.722
Yeah, absolutely.

39:33.742 --> 39:49.504
Yeah, and I think that, well, this is probably true more in the 19th world than in the book world, but I think that readers are very often underestimated in terms of what they can appreciate and comprehend and all that stuff.

39:49.524 --> 39:53.169
Do you think that you're writing for a lot of the same readers that you have in the magazines?

39:53.590 --> 39:54.411
Do you think they've kind of...

39:54.728 --> 40:23.200
I like to think, you know what, you know how there's those crossover songs, you know, like Country Western that makes it in the mainstream, and I like to think that that's what I do in writing, that yes, that those people who enjoy reading me in magazines will enjoy the novels, but I also like to, I hope that I write an accessible kind of literary fiction, and that it does have a literary quality that people can

40:23.905 --> 40:30.354
And you don't have a specific reader, you can't see this reader?

40:30.374 --> 40:32.837
You can see this reader when you're writing?

40:33.077 --> 40:42.250
If I'm forced to classify myself I would say that it's probably truest to say that I write about women for women.

40:42.430 --> 40:44.173
I mean that seems to be what I'm doing.

40:44.213 --> 40:51.142
But you're certainly happy when you find men who work.

40:51.162 --> 40:52.003
I'm delighted, yes.

40:52.524 --> 40:53.305
Do you get fan mail?

40:53.656 --> 40:54.177
Yeah.

40:54.978 --> 40:56.200
And how does it run in terms of sex?

40:56.220 --> 40:56.781
Oh, you know what?

40:57.001 --> 41:00.907
Ten-to-one women, or is it—?

41:00.988 --> 41:04.152
That's probably pretty close.

41:04.173 --> 41:05.334
That's a good guess.

41:05.735 --> 41:06.717
You know what?

41:06.757 --> 41:09.881
There's a woman who has a terrible chronic cancer.

41:09.902 --> 41:11.865
She's really not doing that at all.

41:11.885 --> 41:16.652
I mean, there's a good thing you talk about.

41:16.672 --> 41:17.233
I had a male.

41:17.838 --> 41:25.307
Naturally, I thought, oh, it's too hard for her to talk, and it's too hard for her to write, so she puts all the letters here and all the numbers, and there's everything.

41:27.069 --> 41:30.312
So, yeah, that means a lot, those letters.

41:30.933 --> 41:32.115
Do you answer them?

41:32.135 --> 41:33.937
Yep.

41:33.957 --> 41:34.457
Everyone.

41:34.517 --> 41:39.884
Well, I want to.

41:40.905 --> 41:42.006
I think I've got...

41:44.315 --> 41:45.717
I think I've got everything.

41:45.757 --> 41:47.720
Of course, if I don't, I can call you.

41:47.780 --> 41:48.101
Sure.

41:48.261 --> 41:50.504
Now, are these your seashells or your kids?

41:51.306 --> 41:52.067
Do you like seashells?

41:52.147 --> 41:52.507
Gretty.

41:54.030 --> 41:55.352
We all love seashells.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.755
Gretty, my friend.

41:58.016 --> 41:58.436
That's hers.

41:58.456 --> 41:58.737
Really?

41:59.117 --> 41:59.959
I love them, too.

41:59.999 --> 42:01.501
Those are hers.

42:02.222 --> 42:05.908
Those are hers.

42:06.489 --> 42:09.173
They came from her house after she... Really?

42:09.613 --> 42:09.994
Yeah.

42:10.014 --> 42:11.436
She left me her...

42:12.783 --> 42:15.326
You see, I asked a question.

42:15.346 --> 42:16.447
That's a hell of a detail.

42:16.467 --> 42:17.448
That's quite a detail.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.512
Yeah, she left me her bird's nest on her shelf.

42:22.815 --> 42:23.756
I have some bird's nests.

42:24.317 --> 42:26.099
Some of those are mine and some are hers up there.

42:26.159 --> 42:29.082
Four bird's nests up there on her bookcase.

42:29.102 --> 42:30.984
Yeah, there's one here and there's one here.

42:31.004 --> 42:35.990
Wait, did you say you collect bird's nests and rocks and shelves?

42:36.030 --> 42:36.391
Yeah.

42:36.411 --> 42:37.072
These are things?

42:37.232 --> 42:38.733
Is this a fascination for nature?

42:38.814 --> 42:41.777
There's a big one inside my bed in case I get scared.

42:42.635 --> 42:44.096
I hold on to it.

42:44.657 --> 42:44.837
Why?

42:45.037 --> 42:49.281
Why is it, what kind of, what is it about?

42:49.381 --> 42:54.946
It's like when you're drunk and the room is spinning around and you have to go like this, you know, so the room stops spinning.

42:55.407 --> 42:58.350
Of course I've only heard that, I don't know, from personal experience.

42:58.370 --> 42:58.630
I understand.

42:58.650 --> 43:00.332
But when there are moments of great anxiety.

43:00.992 --> 43:10.781
And at times when, you know, if the rash is back, if there's cancer stuff going on, you know, I hold on to it.

43:10.801 --> 43:11.562
To the birds then.

43:12.250 --> 43:13.171
No, to the rock.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.212
I thought you said a bird's nest.

43:14.333 --> 43:15.734
No, I had a rock.

43:15.794 --> 43:19.539
No, if I held onto the bird's nest, it would say, oh, stop!

43:19.579 --> 43:20.120
To the rock.

43:20.620 --> 43:23.984
Yeah, yeah.

43:24.004 --> 43:25.306
You know what happened the other day?

43:25.346 --> 43:26.848
I was writing a scene.

43:26.928 --> 43:32.234
I was finishing this book I just finished, and it was a pretty hot scene.

43:32.615 --> 43:36.299
And a lot of times I light candles when I work.

43:36.319 --> 43:38.242
And I turn it around.

43:38.362 --> 43:38.662
Right here?

43:38.963 --> 43:39.203
In here?

43:39.588 --> 43:52.990
I turned around and this, I had a candle in here, and it was like a Bunsen burner, and it had gone up the dark, it went, and it was, and it was, and it was, and the flame, the flame was shooting out of here, it was real close.

43:53.010 --> 43:54.292
These are my books here.

43:54.312 --> 43:54.512
Yeah.

43:54.853 --> 43:56.375
Look, here it is.

43:56.395 --> 43:58.839
This is, this is the Dutch version of Talk Before Sleep.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.023
It's called, Let's Talk Some More.

44:02.946 --> 44:03.587
It works.

44:03.854 --> 44:10.301
Anyway, I was shooting out, so I had to come flying over to get my fist to push that.

44:10.861 --> 44:12.643
Ooh, it was really a wonderful comment.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.986
So you've given me the title of— These are quilts.

44:15.046 --> 44:16.828
This is my other passion, quilting.

44:17.248 --> 44:17.789
Quilting.

44:17.809 --> 44:19.350
Quilting and cooking.

44:19.530 --> 44:19.630
Food.

44:19.650 --> 44:20.832
And when do you do the quilting?

44:20.852 --> 44:24.455
Do you do that—I mean, are you a very—do you have a good routine?

44:24.475 --> 44:27.719
Do you have a— Yeah, come look at this.

44:27.739 --> 44:29.561
I do—okay, I write in the morning.

44:31.363 --> 44:33.625
The closer I am to sleep, the better.

44:33.858 --> 44:38.866
because you're sort of still plugged into that, you know, subconscious placement.

44:39.908 --> 44:44.155
And I'll usually write for a couple hours.

44:44.516 --> 44:53.751
The other day I wrote from 7 in the morning until 6.30 at night, which is very unusual.

44:53.771 --> 44:54.753
I usually write for a few hours.

44:54.773 --> 45:00.422
And then I cook and, you know, I won't say in the piece, by the way, that you live in Natick.

45:00.892 --> 45:07.902
I will just say that you live in a Boston suburb.

45:07.982 --> 45:12.909
So this is Jenny's quilt that I need to quilt, and that's one that Julie started, my older daughter.

45:12.949 --> 45:14.091
She's starting one there.

45:14.311 --> 45:16.474
So you actually have a full setup down here.

45:16.635 --> 45:17.696
What would you call this room?

45:17.896 --> 45:19.158
We're in the basement right now.

45:19.479 --> 45:20.761
This is my sewing area.

45:20.961 --> 45:23.565
This is all my... I love fabric.

45:23.585 --> 45:24.185
I love it.

45:24.346 --> 45:25.587
It's like an addiction.

45:25.607 --> 45:25.988
Anyway.

45:26.423 --> 45:30.908
I would say this is a pretty sophisticated work room that you've set up.

45:30.928 --> 45:33.650
Yes, this is really nice because all my stuff can be cut.

45:33.670 --> 45:34.912
What do you call this stuff here?

45:35.292 --> 45:40.758
This is, when you're cutting, this is razor sharp, so watch out.

45:40.838 --> 45:41.578
I'm not touching.

45:41.598 --> 45:46.383
This is just the math that you use when you lay the fabric out and then you go whoosh and you cut through all kinds of layers.

45:46.864 --> 45:49.947
I was going to show you my fabulous fish fabric.

45:49.967 --> 45:52.950
But do you work on this every day or do you take time?

45:52.990 --> 45:56.093
More in the winter than in the summer.

45:56.461 --> 46:01.607
But I get into things.

46:01.647 --> 46:06.293
Like if I'm making something, I'll come down and work on it every day.

46:06.313 --> 46:08.836
I just made a robe that I was down here every day for.

46:08.956 --> 46:14.924
And this is, ooh, there's a cancer blaster.

46:14.944 --> 46:15.204
See?

46:15.264 --> 46:16.065
You come down here.

46:16.145 --> 46:20.751
If you're in a very good mood, you weigh yourself, otherwise you bypass that.

46:21.752 --> 46:24.656
Then you come down here and then you take off all your clothes.

46:24.676 --> 46:25.557
And then you say...

46:26.161 --> 46:28.644
Don't take me now, because I'm having too much fun.

46:28.664 --> 46:30.166
I need to stand in front of this guy.

46:31.027 --> 46:35.472
It's like one, two, three, four, to get all four quadrants.

46:35.492 --> 46:36.153
What is it?

46:36.213 --> 46:38.675
This is ultraviolet light.

46:39.677 --> 46:41.278
For those fluorescent bulbs there.

46:41.799 --> 46:41.999
Mm-hmm.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.122
And I use it for half a minute.

46:44.182 --> 46:45.984
You can use it for more, but I don't need to.

46:46.004 --> 46:47.526
You call it a cancer blaster?

46:47.706 --> 46:48.267
That's what it is.

46:48.287 --> 46:50.649
That's what it is.

46:50.789 --> 46:53.753
And yes, where do you go?

46:53.773 --> 46:53.873
Jeez.

46:55.034 --> 46:58.959
And then at this point I'm doing it twice a week.

47:01.943 --> 47:02.524
Look, here it's a little bit.

47:02.544 --> 47:02.905
Isn't that pretty?

47:02.925 --> 47:03.526
That's nice.

47:03.706 --> 47:05.048
Yeah, that's a gorgeous poster.

47:06.370 --> 47:09.053
They told me that Rizzoli's asked for a poster of my book.

47:09.974 --> 47:12.137
Oh, you're kidding.

47:12.258 --> 47:13.920
Ooh, that's the creme de la creme.

47:13.940 --> 47:15.562
Well, it's the most gorgeous dust jacket.

47:15.883 --> 47:17.745
I can't take any credit for it, this artist.

47:18.546 --> 47:20.429
It's just magnificent.

47:20.569 --> 47:23.113
Yeah, but she did something just spectacular.

47:23.153 --> 47:24.214
It does say gift book.

47:24.852 --> 47:25.793
Yeah, that's an idea.

47:25.973 --> 47:26.354
Anyway.

47:26.794 --> 47:28.296
Ooh, that'll be nice.

47:28.316 --> 47:31.240
Let's hold it.

47:31.260 --> 47:31.500
Hello, Cody.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.683
Cody, Cody is, what kind of a dog is Cody?

47:34.584 --> 47:35.905
He's a tricolor collie.

47:37.047 --> 47:39.770
A nice... He's got flowers from Sally Birdie's garden.

47:41.132 --> 47:41.552
Lovely.

47:41.913 --> 47:44.556
And I have to have flowers at all times.

47:44.576 --> 47:46.478
So in the winter it's a problem.

47:46.498 --> 47:49.041
But I don't grow by them.

47:49.061 --> 47:51.705
But they're really... That's a lovely garden outside.

47:51.725 --> 47:52.786
Isn't that something?

47:52.806 --> 47:53.627
A flower garden.

47:53.747 --> 47:54.488
Oh, great.

47:55.733 --> 47:59.158
My wife loves, has a nice flower garden.

47:59.178 --> 48:01.381
I mean, vegetables we can buy at the fruit store.

48:01.782 --> 48:03.484
I like tomatoes and basil.

48:03.745 --> 48:04.907
Yeah, we do herbs.

48:04.927 --> 48:06.569
I have to say we also do herbs, yeah.

48:06.589 --> 48:07.010
Want a brownie?

48:07.731 --> 48:08.011
Sure.

48:08.472 --> 48:11.016
There's Shannon, the cat.

48:11.296 --> 48:11.837
Oh.

48:13.760 --> 48:13.960
Good.

48:18.907 --> 48:20.550
Oh, oh, you know what happened?

48:20.810 --> 48:21.451
The premise, yeah.

48:21.471 --> 48:24.255
Okay, so listen, I was interested in the idea of what went on in a coma.

48:24.488 --> 48:28.053
And I never like to do research before I write a book.

48:28.073 --> 48:28.975
That's very important.

48:29.035 --> 48:29.576
Yeah, go ahead.

48:29.616 --> 48:34.503
No, I don't like to do it because I don't want it to inform anything in me.

48:34.643 --> 48:37.147
I want it all to come intuitively.

48:37.468 --> 48:41.994
And then, maybe I'll do some research when I'm all done to see if it's possibly true.

48:42.014 --> 48:48.184
So what happened was I started writing Range of Motion and then I said, oh, this is really stupid.

48:48.464 --> 48:49.686
This is so stupid to

48:50.003 --> 48:55.389
To represent somebody in a coma is a ridiculous idea, and I'm sure it's totally inaccurate.

48:55.409 --> 49:01.415
So I went to the library, and I found Richard Selzer in a magazine article.

49:01.435 --> 49:11.545
And the way that he describes, you know, when he refers to himself in the first time, it was exactly the same kind of mood that I was looking for.

49:11.785 --> 49:13.447
And he does that in the book, actually.

49:13.467 --> 49:14.408
I interviewed him on that book.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.570
So I said, okay, fine, that's fine from the universe.

49:17.610 --> 49:19.312
Plus I said, oh, it's so stupid.

49:19.593 --> 49:21.174
Who's going to care about ordinary life?

49:21.275 --> 49:23.517
I'm the only one that's so crazy about ordinary life.

49:23.557 --> 49:25.019
Nobody's going to like, you know.

49:25.760 --> 49:32.848
And I also found on that same day a little tiny article, I think it was in Life magazine, about a farmer who fell out of a barn.

49:33.289 --> 49:34.050
It's not funny.

49:34.390 --> 49:36.292
But he fell out of a barn and he hit his head.

49:36.653 --> 49:39.035
And he was in a coma for six years.

49:39.276 --> 49:44.682
And his wife went to his bedside and talked to him about ordinary life.

49:45.100 --> 49:47.322
And he recovered, and he's fine.

49:47.382 --> 49:49.004
And you read this after you wrote the book.

49:49.505 --> 49:52.648
I read those two things when I had started writing it.

49:52.688 --> 49:54.890
I guess I was about 50 or 60 pages into it.

49:55.311 --> 49:58.954
And so I looked upon that as a nod from the universe.

49:59.155 --> 50:03.479
And then I called Mary Kay Blakely and said, Hey, Mary Kay, Mary Kay, you were in a coma.

50:03.519 --> 50:07.283
You want to read this manuscript and see if it sounds right?

50:07.743 --> 50:08.304
And she did.

50:08.544 --> 50:09.285
And she said, yeah.

50:09.502 --> 50:11.365
Well, that was enough research.

50:11.505 --> 50:15.190
But where did you get the idea for that particular... Between 20 minutes up and up, huh?

50:15.210 --> 50:18.615
We have a sleeping cat over there in a basket in the kitchen, too.

50:18.675 --> 50:19.716
A shadow.

50:20.017 --> 50:20.738
A shadow.

50:20.758 --> 50:21.879
He's as old as Jenny.

50:23.121 --> 50:29.450
So you have a number of animals around, which is... We used to have two dogs and two cats.

50:31.492 --> 50:32.674
The idea for the premise...

50:32.958 --> 50:37.204
of this freak accident which sends Jay off into this coma.

50:37.224 --> 50:39.207
I had a girlfriend that that happened to.

50:39.227 --> 50:43.493
She didn't go in a coma, but she was walking by a building and the ice went... Jeez.

50:43.953 --> 50:45.015
So it really hurt her.

50:45.175 --> 50:48.400
It really hurt her neck.

50:48.540 --> 50:51.964
But she didn't get knocked out or anything.

50:51.985 --> 50:55.229
No, it's sort of silly, isn't it?

50:55.249 --> 50:56.671
But it just goes to show you.

50:56.731 --> 51:00.136
I mean, the most amazing things happen that way.

51:00.156 --> 51:00.957
You know, you...

51:01.831 --> 51:02.852
That's how life is.

51:02.872 --> 51:04.454
It's so sloppy and common.

51:04.494 --> 51:08.819
But the idea of putting him into a coma as the means to go through all of this.

51:09.059 --> 51:11.042
And how long is the coma in the novel, by the way?

51:11.082 --> 51:12.443
I don't think I was alert to that.

51:13.905 --> 51:16.768
I think it's three or four months.

51:16.788 --> 51:18.390
And is that common, uncommon?

51:18.410 --> 51:19.131
Does this happen?

51:19.832 --> 51:21.233
It really, really varies.

51:21.634 --> 51:22.435
This is mine here?

51:22.475 --> 51:22.715
Yeah.

51:22.995 --> 51:23.536
Oh, boy.

51:23.976 --> 51:25.638
Wait, should I put it on a plate?

51:25.658 --> 51:26.479
No, it's fine.

51:27.340 --> 51:28.041
Like some milk?

51:28.321 --> 51:28.902
No, thanks.

51:29.911 --> 51:30.552
You don't?

51:30.732 --> 51:31.774
And I'm not a milkman.

51:31.794 --> 51:34.677
Oh, well, you better have something to drink with it, though.

51:34.697 --> 51:35.418
What will it be?

51:35.458 --> 51:35.899
I have water.

51:35.919 --> 51:36.520
It would be nice.

51:37.742 --> 51:38.442
You want a martini?

51:40.485 --> 51:42.528
I love martini.

51:42.548 --> 51:42.909
And here?

51:43.790 --> 51:44.711
The only one.

51:44.851 --> 51:47.395
That's like a Bombay Sapphire.

51:47.735 --> 51:48.256
It has to be.

51:49.738 --> 51:53.403
That's the indulgence at our home on Saturday nights.

51:53.443 --> 51:59.511
My wife has a gin and tonic, and I do have an extra dry, like I walk by with a removed martini.

51:59.531 --> 51:59.631
Okay.

52:00.877 --> 52:02.080
Here's how you do the remove.

52:02.862 --> 52:06.051
You hold the glass up and say, and that's it.

52:06.733 --> 52:12.247
And, if you really want the martini, you can use these.

52:12.267 --> 52:13.831
Which idea?

52:13.932 --> 52:14.814
Onion stuffed dollars.

52:15.897 --> 52:16.759
Just spray it.
