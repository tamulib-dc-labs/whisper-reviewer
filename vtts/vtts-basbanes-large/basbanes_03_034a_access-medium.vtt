00:02.360 --> 00:05.045
I think the world of Peter.

00:07.430 --> 00:17.248
He's stimulating to talk to him because, you know, some people, when you talk to him, it's like hitting a tennis ball against a rug hung on a rope, you know.

00:17.288 --> 00:18.931
Nothing happens.

00:19.412 --> 00:22.959
When you talk with Peter, boy, it comes back to you, you know.

00:23.821 --> 00:25.684
It's lots of bounce and fun.

00:26.778 --> 00:45.458
You know, I have like a kind of a scripted interview, but right off the bat when you were talking to the teachers and you were mentioning how your work in progress is about 1776, I wonder how influential was Thomas Paine in 1776 and the Declaration of Independence, the reading of him?

00:46.258 --> 00:49.942
Well, Paine's importance can't really be overemphasized.

00:50.122 --> 00:52.225
His importance is phenomenal.

00:54.547 --> 00:55.468
It was, I guess,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.999
hands down, our first bestseller, Common Sense.

01:00.220 --> 01:07.547
And it wasn't just the numbers of people who read it, but who read it and who was influenced by it, including Washington.

01:08.888 --> 01:13.713
Many people were holding back about independence until Common Sense came along.

01:15.174 --> 01:25.624
And it was still touch and go right up until July of that summer of whether Congress would vote to declare independence.

01:26.465 --> 01:30.028
But had there been no book common sense, I don't think it would have happened.

01:31.750 --> 01:32.811
Not that summer, anyway.

01:32.871 --> 01:41.498
And probably wouldn't have happened at all because the fortunes of wars went so against us after that summer of 76, all through the rest of the year.

01:42.339 --> 01:47.203
It's very doubtful Congress would have ever done anything so rash as declare independence.

01:47.383 --> 01:52.388
But this is an instance of where a book... Oh, the book changed history, no question about it.

01:52.408 --> 01:55.010
As did Wealth of Nations, also published the same year.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.151
It was a big year for books.

01:56.587 --> 02:04.696
If you take those three books, Common Sense, Wealth of the Nations, and Gibbon's Decline and Fall of Rome, and then talk about knowing a person by knowing their reading.

02:04.716 --> 02:05.096
Yes.

02:06.077 --> 02:12.665
And interestingly, Gibbon makes comments on the war in America as it proceeds.

02:12.965 --> 02:16.789
And talk about the historian misreading the events of his time.

02:17.630 --> 02:21.094
He sure did, which is very interesting.

02:21.675 --> 02:25.699
I think that Paine also, it should be also understood that Paine was with the army.

02:26.320 --> 02:36.510
in the darkest time when they were retreating across New Jersey toward the Delaware and eventually getting across on the Pennsylvania side.

02:37.171 --> 02:44.678
And that's when he wrote, in the Crisis, These are the Times, the Tri-Men's Souls, which is, needless to say, one of the great lines ever written.

02:44.758 --> 02:47.881
And wasn't that published first anonymously, I think?

02:47.901 --> 02:48.682
No, Common Sense was, yes.

02:48.722 --> 02:49.563
Common Sense was, yes.

02:49.583 --> 02:56.209
And many people thought John Adams had written it, or they thought either Adams or Benjamin Franklin had written it.

02:56.408 --> 02:58.570
We're running well.

03:00.712 --> 03:05.657
This is such a wonderful lecture that you gave, and I've read it a number of times.

03:06.097 --> 03:06.617
Thank you.

03:06.637 --> 03:08.960
And that's how I knew, by the way, why I paint.

03:09.300 --> 03:09.921
I didn't know that.

03:09.941 --> 03:10.601
I knew it from you.

03:10.761 --> 03:25.555
And I guess the good life of the mind, when you talk about entering the life and the mind of someone who lived 200 years ago, obviously you have this treasure trove of correspondence and

03:25.940 --> 03:29.404
and journals, and papers here, and archival documents.

03:29.464 --> 03:31.906
How important, however, is the reading, the books?

03:32.627 --> 03:42.658
You describe Adams as perhaps the best-read person of his era, and I'm assuming when you say that you're ranking him above Jefferson and Franklin.

03:42.698 --> 03:43.138
I do.

03:43.519 --> 03:46.221
I do rank him above Jefferson and Franklin.

03:47.142 --> 03:49.725
Jefferson is a very close second, I would say.

03:50.586 --> 03:54.310
His reading was not only broader, it was deeper.

03:54.880 --> 04:04.314
Now, Jefferson is a very great man and a very great intellect, to say the least, and I'm by no means putting Jefferson down.

04:04.775 --> 04:09.181
I just want to put Adams where I think he belongs as a book man.

04:10.403 --> 04:23.723
And he was more eclectic than Jefferson, and his reading was more passionate as he was, more passionate kind of person.

04:24.901 --> 04:30.629
I think we are what we read to a very large degree, or certainly to a larger degree than you're willing to admit.

04:30.649 --> 04:34.514
There was a famous book years ago called You Are What You Eat.

04:35.135 --> 04:38.619
Well, sure, we are what we eat, I guess, but we are what we read.

04:39.060 --> 04:54.300
And I don't think it's easy or even possible to understand any particular generation or certainly that generation of the founders without reading what they read.

04:55.107 --> 05:08.143
When Jefferson sat down to write the Declaration of Independence, he acknowledged that there was nothing new in what he was saying, that everything he was saying in the Declaration of Independence, he'd taken from what he had read.

05:08.164 --> 05:14.271
And that's true, and literally true.

05:15.012 --> 05:22.802
And his sense, as so many of the people of the 19th century felt, that

05:23.423 --> 05:27.069
the world of the mind was to be found in books.

05:27.089 --> 05:29.092
Ideas were to be found in books.

05:29.893 --> 05:34.080
And people, and that there was nothing one could not learn.

05:34.140 --> 05:51.287
Two of the most interesting figures in the book that I'm working on now, Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox, became high-ranking officers at the very start of the Revolutionary War,

05:52.567 --> 05:56.991
not having had any experience in the military, none.

05:59.053 --> 06:12.686
All that they knew, all that they knew about being an officer, about armament, about drill, about military tactics and strategy, they had gotten from books.

06:12.886 --> 06:15.268
They'd never set foot on a battlefield.

06:15.288 --> 06:19.813
They'd never seen a war, let alone fought in one.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.274
All they knew was what they

06:21.710 --> 06:23.412
had read in books.

06:23.432 --> 06:31.342
But they lived in a time when that was not considered an unusual way to learn something.

06:32.583 --> 06:38.631
That was a very good way to learn something, that through a close study of books there was no limit to what one could learn.

06:40.293 --> 06:45.659
And Nathaniel Green was made a general when he was 33 years old.

06:45.719 --> 06:51.126
He was a general and had never commanded any troops of any kind

06:51.781 --> 06:59.452
and had never seen warfare firsthand, or had any schooling in warfare.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.435
None.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.058
And he turned out to be the best general we had.

07:05.080 --> 07:11.509
By the end of the war, I think one can safely quite fairly say that Nathaniel Green was the most brilliant general we had.

07:11.649 --> 07:14.393
And have people then gone to examine the books that he read?

07:15.134 --> 07:15.695
Oh, sure.

07:15.735 --> 07:16.877
Very well know what he read.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.940
He tells you what he read.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.383
And he was taken, sort of taken under his wing,

07:21.734 --> 07:31.245
by Ezra Stiles, who was a... Nathaniel Green came from Rhode Island, a little town of Greenwich, Rhode Island.

07:32.287 --> 07:36.372
And Ezra Stiles liked this young man and started to guide him in his reading.

07:36.392 --> 07:41.337
Well, Ezra Stiles subsequently became, not very long after that, the president of Yale University.

07:41.398 --> 07:46.003
So this sort of kindly neighborhood friend, as it were,

07:46.540 --> 07:49.484
turns out to be one of the leading intellects of the time.

07:49.564 --> 07:51.307
So Nathaniel Green was very lucky.

07:51.587 --> 07:55.553
He also could afford the books because he had enough money to buy them.

07:55.573 --> 07:59.980
And he would come up to Boston to go to Henry Knox's bookstore.

08:01.362 --> 08:02.924
Henry Knox had the London bookshop.

08:03.224 --> 08:04.066
He was a bookseller.

08:04.707 --> 08:11.116
And part of his stock and trade were military books published mostly in England.

08:11.997 --> 08:15.923
And Green could afford those books because he had sufficient

08:17.354 --> 08:46.264
funds and he would talk with his friend the bookseller Knox about military matters and other matters and they became quite good friends Knox too became Washington's head of all the artillery in his 20s and all he'd ever known was what he'd read in books now it's hugely to Washington's credit it seems to me that he spotted this talent these two young men and gave them their head as leaders

08:46.598 --> 08:50.785
But, of course, Washington himself was an uneducated man, formally.

08:51.266 --> 08:51.486
Uneducated.

08:51.506 --> 08:52.167
Uneducated.

08:52.548 --> 08:58.918
He had very little formal education, not even completing what we might call grade school.

08:58.938 --> 09:03.405
He did not know Latin or Greek, as any educated man of the time did.

09:04.427 --> 09:08.674
And so I'm sure he saw some of himself in these two young men.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.138
And he read the same books.

09:11.843 --> 09:15.028
military treatises as these two did.

09:15.489 --> 09:22.920
So part of the language of the profession, if you will, that they had in common were the books they'd read.

09:23.521 --> 09:28.869
So we are not only what we read, we are in association with others who have read the same thing.

09:29.570 --> 09:33.617
That is a common bond that can develop between people.

09:35.119 --> 09:38.965
Book clubs today are two people who each have a

09:39.586 --> 09:44.931
huge fondness for a particular book, and they get together, and they say, yes, we have that in common.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.455
His question, is it safe to assume that the opposing generals are reading the same books?

09:48.835 --> 09:50.197
Yes.

09:50.217 --> 09:50.777
Absolutely.

09:50.797 --> 09:52.059
So does one neutralize the other?

09:52.219 --> 10:00.567
Wasn't it said of Grant that maybe one of the reasons he was so successful was that he was last in class, or maybe he hadn't been reading the books that everyone else had been reading?

10:00.587 --> 10:02.629
I hate to jump around in centuries.

10:02.730 --> 10:04.812
Well, of course, it all depends on who's reading the book.

10:05.072 --> 10:09.036
And our

10:09.286 --> 10:14.932
Our generals, our military leaders, were amateurs compared to the British.

10:15.933 --> 10:18.956
British officers were very good officers, by and large.

10:18.976 --> 10:26.885
Now, they made some big mistakes, and their overall strategy was not so good.

10:28.987 --> 10:37.977
But they ran rings around us for the first years or more, and it wasn't really until the horrendous defeat of

10:38.142 --> 10:45.930
Burgoyne at Saratoga that the odds began to turn that maybe we didn't have a chance.

10:46.911 --> 10:57.903
But we were, we had a lot in common with those people that we were fighting.

10:57.983 --> 11:05.591
It wasn't just that they spoke the same language, or in many cases the same genetic stock.

11:05.631 --> 11:05.871
I mean,

11:06.492 --> 11:07.914
John Adams was an Englishman.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.936
That's his entire background.

11:12.340 --> 11:13.601
Genetically, he was all English.

11:13.661 --> 11:18.708
He was as English as anybody could be, though he'd never set foot in England until later on.

11:20.791 --> 11:23.334
But they read the same things.

11:24.055 --> 11:34.929
The novels that our people of that time, the leaders of the Revolution, and those who weren't in favor of the Revolution, they all read the same novels that the Englishmen read.

11:34.949 --> 11:35.790
They were English novels.

11:36.209 --> 11:37.610
There were no books published here.

11:37.971 --> 11:39.312
No, of course not.

11:39.913 --> 11:42.195
And Henry Knox's book is the London Bookshop.

11:42.395 --> 11:44.077
It's the best that you could buy.

11:44.137 --> 11:51.405
You can see the earlier selection of 100 books influential in America prior to 1900.

11:52.486 --> 11:53.727
It's the Farmer's Almanac.

11:54.268 --> 12:01.736
It's the Montgomery Wart catalog, which predates the Sirs Roebuck catalog.

12:02.036 --> 12:03.938
I mean, it's very utilitarian things.

12:04.103 --> 12:11.886
There are a few items, obviously, but when we go for our entertainment and inspiration,

12:12.187 --> 12:13.288
We go to farm books.

12:13.509 --> 12:22.300
Obviously, we have notable exceptions with Mark Twain and Hawthorne and the others, but books at that point were really how to tell you how to grow things on the farm.

12:22.820 --> 12:26.825
I think next to the Bible, the Farmers' Almanac was number two in Holmes.

12:27.366 --> 12:28.247
There are figures.

12:28.347 --> 12:28.708
I'm sure.

12:28.728 --> 12:31.591
Let's just kind of back up entirely to what you were just saying.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.396
Leon E. Dowell wrote a little book about Henry James' library.

12:35.416 --> 12:39.742
You talk about the fabulous literary biographies that he wrote about James.

12:40.182 --> 12:41.704
He did one little monograph.

12:42.275 --> 12:48.342
but how essential it was for him to know the reading of Henry James, the books, to go to the library.

12:48.362 --> 12:51.646
And I wonder how important it is for you.

12:51.666 --> 13:05.723
I mean, again, you have this fabulous resource here at the Historical Society, but how important also is it to have access not only to Adams' books, but to the wonderful, apparently, marginalia and annotations of these books.

13:05.763 --> 13:07.145
Oh, infinitely valuable.

13:08.086 --> 13:11.370
John Adams was a disputatious sort of fellow.

13:11.789 --> 13:18.155
And he liked to stir the waters and rock the boat a little bit and argue.

13:18.315 --> 13:23.159
He made his career, his fame, as a court attorney.

13:24.280 --> 13:31.887
He was the best courtroom attorney in the Commonwealth, in the process at that time.

13:31.907 --> 13:36.251
And he would argue with the author that he was reading.

13:36.411 --> 13:41.155
And he loved to read authors whose opinions were different from his.

13:41.708 --> 13:45.673
There's a book in the Boston Public Library, which I hope we'll see this afternoon.

13:45.733 --> 13:49.538
I think it's almost as if he wrote more in the margins than the author wrote in the book.

13:51.580 --> 13:57.228
And they're sometimes quite funny, and they're sometimes quite pertinent, and sometimes, in my view, quite convincing.

13:58.609 --> 14:03.075
He was ambitious.

14:03.882 --> 14:04.964
An ambitious reader.

14:05.585 --> 14:08.109
There was nothing he would not undertake.

14:08.189 --> 14:14.118
I think he was 80 years old when he undertook to read a 16-volume French history in French.

14:14.138 --> 14:17.102
You mentioned that.

14:17.123 --> 14:17.203
Yes.

14:17.223 --> 14:32.286
And his wife at the time, Abigail, wrote at the time, I think, as I remember, to John Quincy saying, I think the last passion that will leave your father is his love of books.

14:32.536 --> 14:38.842
And I quote that in the book, so if I've got it wrong now, it's in there accurately.

14:38.962 --> 14:50.094
But to a degree, of course, a lawyer in that day, and still, a lawyer had to have a library.

14:50.114 --> 14:57.501
An attorney was the mark of a professional man in the law to have a library.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.345
And it was also the mark of a gentleman to have a library.

15:02.523 --> 15:05.627
A gentleman was a gentleman in part because he had a library.

15:05.787 --> 15:07.168
And it's called the Gentleman's Library.

15:07.188 --> 15:07.469
Yes.

15:08.310 --> 15:14.457
And it was, of course, to a degree a measure of affluence because books were expensive.

15:15.698 --> 15:17.921
But it was also a measure of taste and interest.

15:19.663 --> 15:30.015
And as a fellow who grew up on a farm whose mother was almost certainly illiterate to rise in

15:31.430 --> 15:53.853
station in life where he not only had an education but had a library and could converse about books with his comparable associates in the law or in the life of the community was a sign of opportunity, the land of opportunity.

15:55.615 --> 16:00.019
There's no end to his

16:00.792 --> 16:05.436
his journey of the mind and the soul.

16:05.637 --> 16:07.739
And a lot of that is in what he's reading.

16:09.340 --> 16:18.269
And there's no end to his growth, his evolving, nor his love of life.

16:20.811 --> 16:30.360
And his love of the language, that wonderful letter he wrote to his son, John Quincy, when the boy was

16:31.336 --> 16:40.748
a student at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, just down the road from where he was living, John Adams was living in Amsterdam.

16:42.170 --> 16:53.764
And he said, of course you must read Cicero and Thucydides and Tacitus and so forth, but don't forget the writers in your own language and the poets in your own language.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.426
And wherever you go, take a book with you.

16:56.227 --> 16:59.031
And then he writes that, absolutely.

16:59.534 --> 17:00.475
fabulous line.

17:00.776 --> 17:03.399
You'll never be alone with a poet in your pocket.

17:03.839 --> 17:04.700
I saw that line.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.722
I have it here in my notes.

17:06.082 --> 17:10.788
And that is unfortunately, sadly, not something that you will see urged today.

17:11.188 --> 17:14.713
Well, it ought to be flying on a banner atop of every library, you know.

17:15.614 --> 17:20.200
It's just a great expression of what matters.

17:21.081 --> 17:28.630
And then the other letter I dearly love is the letter where he writes from France to his family explaining why

17:28.964 --> 17:41.900
why he's doing this, why he's staying away from his family, neglecting his responsibilities as a father and a provider for their wherewithal and their education.

17:42.300 --> 17:55.056
And he writes that I must study politics and war so that my sons can study finance and naval architecture and so forth, so that their children can study poetry and painting and music.

17:55.289 --> 17:57.672
He sees that as the upward climb.

17:57.692 --> 17:59.534
That's progress to his mind.

17:59.554 --> 18:07.683
And that's why I think it's so important for people to understand what did they mean in that time when they talked about the pursuit of happiness.

18:08.604 --> 18:10.566
Happiness for John Adams was in books.

18:12.228 --> 18:15.292
You mentioned a number of facts, and I just do love it.

18:15.312 --> 18:16.854
I would like a few quotes on it.

18:16.874 --> 18:20.518
These quotes from Joseph Addison.

18:20.538 --> 18:20.638
Yeah.

18:20.821 --> 18:24.046
You have discerned it in Hale and George Washington.

18:24.266 --> 18:26.469
Adams, you say, Washington used it four times.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.953
He's known to have seen the play performed seven times.

18:28.973 --> 18:30.035
Well, I have to check that.

18:30.075 --> 18:33.921
He read it many times, and he saw it many times.

18:33.941 --> 18:36.364
He quoted it on numerous occasions.

18:38.107 --> 18:40.711
And you said they didn't have to make the attribution.

18:40.731 --> 18:42.013
They didn't have to use quotation marks.

18:42.553 --> 18:44.657
It was understood that you knew this.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.980
But I had no idea that Addison was so...

18:47.298 --> 18:49.240
well-read over here on the college.

18:49.260 --> 18:49.461
Oh, yeah.

18:49.741 --> 18:51.883
It was the most popular play here by far.

18:52.504 --> 18:54.446
Now, many people had never seen the play before.

18:56.589 --> 18:57.951
The Virginians all loved the theater.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.372
That was part of the social life there.

18:59.392 --> 19:00.814
Washington adored the theater.

19:01.435 --> 19:03.437
He went to see Hamlet several times.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.500
He would go to the theater at every chance.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.722
He went to New York at one point.

19:07.762 --> 19:09.024
I think he went to the theater every night.

19:09.985 --> 19:16.933
The two things about Washington I think are a window into him that

19:17.605 --> 19:19.647
make him anything but the marble man.

19:20.328 --> 19:21.730
One of them is his love of the theater.

19:23.111 --> 19:24.092
We never hear about this.

19:24.112 --> 19:24.253
No.

19:25.034 --> 19:28.838
And the other is he was passionate interior decorator.

19:30.260 --> 19:30.440
Who knew?

19:30.820 --> 19:31.080
Yeah.

19:32.042 --> 19:35.766
He loved architecture and landscape architecture.

19:36.447 --> 19:38.669
Monticello was entirely his creation.

19:38.749 --> 19:39.831
I don't mean Mount Vernon.

19:40.732 --> 19:41.993
Is entirely his creation.

19:42.395 --> 19:44.097
He picked every paint color.

19:44.137 --> 19:52.985
He picked the embroidery on the drapery, the rugs, the kind of floor that would be put down, everything.

19:53.105 --> 19:55.428
And if it was wrong, he would get rid of it.

19:55.448 --> 20:01.814
And he would write to London these long letters specifying exactly what he wanted now to be, this color, this, and so forth.

20:02.615 --> 20:05.697
And appearances are very important to him.

20:05.718 --> 20:11.423
His uniform, how he looks, because he felt that that was part of leadership.

20:12.905 --> 20:16.950
which is a perfectly interesting point of view, perfectly legitimate.

20:18.032 --> 20:19.894
I don't want to cover things that you've covered elsewhere.

20:19.914 --> 20:31.650
I thought that lecture that you gave at the Book Festival and the Vignette Gazette happily re-printed out a couple weeks ago, and I've annotated it, and I'm confident that I can quote from that.

20:31.670 --> 20:33.833
You can take anything you want, absolutely.

20:33.913 --> 20:37.658
But I find that, you know, you mentioned Margaret Leach's Reveille in Washington.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.119
Yes.

20:38.453 --> 20:40.937
I adore that.

20:41.217 --> 20:45.103
You had a wonderful quote there that I would just ask you to expand on a bit.

20:45.744 --> 20:52.133
You mentioned at the National Book, you assert that history, biography, poetry, fiction are not disconnected.

20:52.274 --> 20:59.685
When we see these lists of the most influential books of our time, they reportedly leave out works of the imagination.

20:59.965 --> 21:00.546
It's almost like

21:00.880 --> 21:02.982
Harry Peter Stowe didn't matter.

21:03.142 --> 21:03.422
Right.

21:03.442 --> 21:06.185
And you mentioned Pilgrim's Progress, which is read by everyone.

21:06.425 --> 21:06.686
Yes.

21:06.906 --> 21:08.227
Or utopia by Thomas Ford.

21:08.287 --> 21:08.888
And the Bible.

21:09.828 --> 21:10.189
And the Bible.

21:10.209 --> 21:12.031
You know, nobody reads the Bible today.

21:12.171 --> 21:15.994
Well, if you can, I really believe, you cannot understand those people.

21:16.034 --> 21:18.136
I'm interviewing Elaine Pagels this Friday.

21:18.216 --> 21:19.257
Unless you know the Bible.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.359
I'm requesting for you people to read the Bible today.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.142
You simply can't understand.

21:24.202 --> 21:25.243
Hi, Rachel.

21:25.844 --> 21:27.225
Do you have anything you need?

21:27.560 --> 21:28.521
Everything we need.

21:28.802 --> 21:28.902
Okay.

21:28.922 --> 21:29.843
How are you?

21:29.863 --> 21:30.043
I'm good.

21:30.063 --> 21:30.343
How are you?

21:30.363 --> 21:30.464
Good.

21:30.564 --> 21:31.225
Good to see you.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.927
Good to see you.

21:32.947 --> 21:33.527
This is Nick.

21:33.547 --> 21:34.449
Mr. Basbanes.

21:34.489 --> 21:35.230
Nick Basbanes.

21:35.570 --> 21:35.690
Hello.

21:35.710 --> 21:36.431
Rachel Weiss.

21:37.793 --> 21:37.913
Hello.

21:37.933 --> 21:40.116
Rachel's the daughter of one of my dearest friends.

21:40.776 --> 21:40.857
Huh?

21:41.778 --> 21:43.179
One of the best guys I ever knew.

21:43.540 --> 21:44.321
Ed Weiss.

21:46.984 --> 21:47.044
Oh.

21:47.064 --> 21:47.405
Yeah.

21:47.945 --> 21:48.706
Oh, he always will.

21:49.668 --> 21:49.768
Yeah.

21:49.788 --> 21:51.470
So will you.

21:52.251 --> 21:52.511
Yeah.

21:52.531 --> 21:52.731
All right.

21:52.751 --> 21:53.032
Thank you.

21:53.052 --> 21:56.156
Thank you so much for talking about reading the Bible.

21:56.176 --> 21:56.436
Yeah.

21:57.209 --> 22:08.124
I guess the original question... And the language of the Bible.

22:09.306 --> 22:17.638
When they took the prayer out of the schools, I understand why they did that.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.845
But I don't think any harm was done by saying the Lord's Prayer in the schools.

22:23.281 --> 22:27.326
And when I went to school, the teacher read a passage from the Bible every morning.

22:27.927 --> 22:29.348
It was always from the Old Testament.

22:29.789 --> 22:30.730
And this is public school?

22:30.810 --> 22:31.431
Public school.

22:32.632 --> 22:39.381
And I think that just listening to that use of the English language, the poetry of it.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.444
She was reading poetry to us every morning.

22:42.865 --> 22:43.486
Beautiful poetry.

22:43.506 --> 22:44.507
Beautiful poetry.

22:46.489 --> 22:50.975
And it stuck.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.697
When I was a child, I spake of this book.

22:52.863 --> 22:59.993
Child, you know, she read that one again and again because she was trying to get us to grow up, shape up.

23:01.115 --> 23:01.796
What do you make of it?

23:04.299 --> 23:04.920
Oh, you found it.

23:05.581 --> 23:07.504
Oh, aren't you wonderful.

23:07.985 --> 23:09.767
Thank you so much.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.474
Are you looking for the Henrietta and Wilson?

23:14.494 --> 23:14.654
No.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.636
Somebody else was there.

23:16.337 --> 23:17.358
Thank you.

23:17.498 --> 23:20.102
You mentioned the staff, I beg you.

23:20.352 --> 23:21.854
Oh, fantastic.

23:21.874 --> 23:22.534
Fantastic.

23:22.594 --> 23:29.942
And I had to smile when you're talking about footnotes because my first book, I just wrote as a muse, directed me.

23:30.003 --> 23:33.446
And of course, that book took me eight years to write and to go back into mine.

23:33.747 --> 23:38.832
Not to write, but to do all the work on it and to find where in the world that I get this quote, you know?

23:38.852 --> 23:39.032
Yeah.

23:39.233 --> 23:43.497
You remember when you're a kid and you're trying to ride a bike and somebody else would put a stick in between the spokes?

23:43.758 --> 23:44.118
Yeah.

23:44.138 --> 23:47.742
That's the way I feel it would be if you stopped and tried to do your source notes.

23:47.762 --> 23:48.643
You wouldn't go anywhere.

23:49.143 --> 23:49.684
Stick in the...

23:50.035 --> 23:52.939
You don't write on a computer, though, do you?

23:52.959 --> 23:54.201
No, I write on a typewriter.

23:54.221 --> 23:55.843
I write on a manual typewriter.

23:55.903 --> 23:58.246
And I do kind of insert the little sources.

23:58.326 --> 24:08.520
I'm doing it just in reg, and then I found that it's just... Well, maybe when I figure out what do I want to do with my life, I'll learn to do sort of stuff.

24:08.540 --> 24:11.143
Let's jump over briefly, if you can, to Harry Truman.

24:11.344 --> 24:19.114
What can we say about him and his... Well, certainly he's a beautiful example of an unlettered man

24:20.275 --> 24:21.496
who never stopped reading.

24:22.898 --> 24:25.802
Do you know he was a Baker Speed irregular?

24:26.262 --> 24:27.464
No, I did not know that.

24:27.664 --> 24:28.765
I did not know that.

24:28.785 --> 24:31.188
Not many people do.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.890
I know Bess loved mysteries.

24:35.513 --> 24:40.219
When he was retired, they used to go to the library, and she would come out with an armload of mysteries.

24:42.561 --> 24:49.810
It's said that he and his man that became the press secretary, him pulling a blank,

24:51.055 --> 24:57.581
who was the smartest boy in the class, they decided they were going to read every book in the Independence Public Library.

24:57.601 --> 25:13.695
Well, the Independence Public Library was very small, and nonetheless, it probably had several hundred books, and they may have read them all, but they certainly claimed they did, and they took that on, and that was an ambitious thing to do.

25:15.116 --> 25:20.961
Truman loved history and biography, and that's mostly what he read.

25:21.295 --> 25:23.538
I'm not sure he ever read a novel.

25:23.639 --> 25:25.161
I don't know that he read a novel.

25:25.181 --> 25:28.326
He certainly never talked about one that I know of.

25:30.209 --> 25:32.552
Unlike Adams, to him, a book was very precious.

25:32.913 --> 25:40.665
He didn't even like to fold down the corner of a page to mark where he'd stopped reading because that would damage the book.

25:43.029 --> 25:43.670
This is Adams.

25:44.070 --> 25:44.291
No.

25:44.491 --> 25:45.252
This is Truman.

25:45.292 --> 25:47.235
No, Adams writes in the margins and everything.

25:47.335 --> 25:48.056
Yeah.

25:48.177 --> 25:49.699
All of them.

25:50.405 --> 25:53.088
Truman did not acquire a great library.

25:53.989 --> 26:06.785
He loved the work of Douglas Southall Friedman, the biographer of Lee and Lee's lieutenants, and the biographer of George Washington.

26:08.127 --> 26:19.180
He was very fond of those books, and he never stopped reading, nor did Kennedy, nor did

26:20.003 --> 26:22.526
Heaven knows Jefferson.

26:23.948 --> 26:24.449
Or Clinton.

26:25.611 --> 26:36.425
And the present president, contrary to what everybody says, does read books, reads quite a lot of books, and is very interested in history and biography.

26:36.525 --> 26:38.268
And so does his father.

26:39.730 --> 26:46.098
And I know his father better than I know the present president.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.762
And he always tells me what he's reading.

26:49.822 --> 26:53.887
and what he enjoyed, what he particularly admires.

26:54.247 --> 26:56.189
It's an interesting, you don't mind my jumping around?

26:56.209 --> 26:56.650
No, no.

26:56.670 --> 27:01.795
But one of the things that stuck in my head when I was thinking about this book, you talk about writing about what you know.

27:02.176 --> 27:04.438
People say to me, why do I keep writing books about books?

27:04.518 --> 27:06.020
I know this subject.

27:06.801 --> 27:15.931
When Bill Clinton was leaving office three and a half years ago, someone from the New York Times asked him, what one piece of advice would you give to your successor?

27:16.011 --> 27:16.892
And he said,

27:17.260 --> 27:22.728
I would strongly urge him to read David Herbert Donald's biography of Abraham Lincoln.

27:22.748 --> 27:35.248
And I just wonder, I'm going to ask Professor Donald this question as well, but what do you think Clinton wanted President Bush to derive from his biography?

27:35.268 --> 27:38.072
In the absence of my being unable to answer that question.

27:38.092 --> 27:44.702
I think he probably wanted him to realize how

27:45.526 --> 27:47.949
difficult it is to be president of the United States.

27:56.800 --> 28:12.799
The more I know about the presidency, the more I know people who have been or are president, the more understanding I feel about how hard that job is.

28:14.095 --> 28:21.325
There is no one human being that can handle that job, no matter how much they protest to the contrary.

28:22.927 --> 28:27.052
Imagine trying to go to sleep at night with all the worries that any president has.

28:29.115 --> 28:39.970
And I think it's a miracle, really, that any of them have had time to sit down and read a book to take their mind off their immediate problems.

28:40.571 --> 28:42.313
And my guess is that he also wanted to

28:44.335 --> 28:51.165
President Bush to have a sense of how heavy the burden has been in times past.

28:54.569 --> 29:00.278
Truman probably knew more about the presidency from having read books about the presidency than any president up to his time.

29:00.298 --> 29:00.518
Really?

29:00.999 --> 29:01.479
Absolutely.

29:02.641 --> 29:12.655
And I think that the value of reading for people in high public positions of reading history is they get a sense of cause and effect.

29:13.968 --> 29:23.863
And they get a sense, I would hope, that what we don't do is often as important as what we do in positions of great responsibility.

29:25.265 --> 29:29.090
Very few people give Eisenhower credit for not going into Vietnam, for example.

29:29.191 --> 29:31.153
Well, that was an extremely important decision.

29:31.834 --> 29:35.159
Because we often decide what not to do as well as what we do.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.942
And presidents do it all the time.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.347
What you got?

29:40.597 --> 29:45.341
No, somebody else wanted that.

29:45.762 --> 29:46.282
Okay.

29:47.764 --> 29:48.364
Maybe Peter.

29:48.724 --> 29:50.826
Maybe Peter wanted it.

29:50.846 --> 29:51.287
Okay.

29:51.667 --> 29:52.188
Pretty nice.

29:52.648 --> 29:53.088
Let's see it.

29:54.630 --> 29:55.671
Oh, look at that.

29:56.932 --> 30:00.235
Wow.

30:00.295 --> 30:04.179
Isn't that wonderful?

30:04.799 --> 30:07.181
Yeah, we just brought the Henry Adams Library back.

30:07.201 --> 30:08.983
This place is so amazing.

30:10.482 --> 30:15.668
and discovery, and look at the stuff that's inside.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.250
Henry B. Adams.

30:17.270 --> 30:19.473
Look at that.

30:19.573 --> 30:21.195
And it's been red, too, hasn't it?

30:22.516 --> 30:22.616
Yeah.

30:23.477 --> 30:26.581
Very important, isn't it?

30:26.601 --> 30:27.242
Oh, yes.

30:27.262 --> 30:28.523
You've given me a photo op.

30:30.846 --> 30:33.209
We're talking about Truman and his reading.

30:33.229 --> 30:37.654
And by the way, let me know when... I think that the...

30:38.512 --> 30:55.334
The value of history and biography and literature for a president, as it is for all of us, is that they get a much stronger sense that their decisions, what they're doing, matters in the long run, not just the short run.

30:57.357 --> 31:00.240
That they are a link in a very long chain.

31:01.162 --> 31:02.944
And there's only one link.

31:02.964 --> 31:05.347
And the chain goes way back, and it's going to go way forward.

31:06.188 --> 31:08.451
And the world didn't begin and isn't going to end.

31:08.971 --> 31:36.666
in our time and or in his that particular president's time in office and therefore try as best you can not to make your decisions based on is it going to give me a bounce in the polls on tuesday but how will it stand the test of time how will it hold how will it look 10 years from now or 50 years or 150 years from now to me when adam's

31:37.152 --> 31:56.749
when Adams chooses not to go to war with France, this spectacular example of a president choosing not to do something, when it would have been hugely advantageous to his political career and would have gained him all kinds of popularity and adulation, which he'd never had and which he wanted as any human being would.

31:57.870 --> 32:05.337
But he had the backbone to not go that way.

32:06.076 --> 32:15.966
When we were talking casually out in the other room this morning, I mentioned your reference to Lincoln and Grace Elegy.

32:15.986 --> 32:16.166
Yes.

32:16.286 --> 32:18.668
And you memorized it.

32:18.688 --> 32:19.509
Well, I once knew it.

32:20.330 --> 32:35.425
But the important passage is, let not ambition mock their useful toil, their homely joys and destiny obscure, nor grandeur here with disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor.

32:35.776 --> 32:39.100
And then there's the great line, the paths of glory lead but to the grave.

32:40.061 --> 32:53.336
Now that's, you know, if you know that Lincoln loved that poem, you understand that this, Lincoln had a very dark view of life, a very, he was very often very melancholy, very town blue.

32:54.337 --> 33:00.144
And that comes from, and of course he comes out of the short and simple channels of the poor.

33:00.204 --> 33:01.586
He is of that world.

33:03.168 --> 33:05.310
And he loved the poetry of the language.

33:05.864 --> 33:14.215
What's so interesting about Lincoln is that phenomenal gift of using language doesn't show until he becomes president.

33:14.656 --> 33:15.457
That's extraordinary.

33:15.477 --> 33:15.897
It is.

33:16.799 --> 33:19.202
There's no prior... To what do you attribute this?

33:19.663 --> 33:20.804
Rising to the occasion.

33:21.104 --> 33:22.807
We never know what we can do.

33:22.827 --> 33:25.931
And you can never predict who's going to be a great president.

33:26.392 --> 33:33.882
There is no curriculum vitae that will give us, this guy's going to be a superb president.

33:33.942 --> 33:34.943
It doesn't matter.

33:36.374 --> 33:46.005
If your resume was the blueprint for your presidency or the guarantee that Herbert Hoover would have been easily one of the best presidents we ever had.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.687
He had a fabulous life.

33:47.707 --> 33:49.109
He was good at everything he'd ever done.

33:49.209 --> 33:53.794
He was a superb executive, a great American, but he was the wrong man for the time.

33:55.376 --> 34:06.229
Harry Truman, who would have ever thought that he would, in retrospect, be seen as one of the stronger, more effective, and important presidents of all?

34:07.458 --> 34:15.650
And we shouldn't forget, you know, this wonderful attention that has come to John Adams because of you.

34:16.050 --> 34:17.132
Well, that's what you've done.

34:17.152 --> 34:17.673
Thank you.

34:17.753 --> 34:21.218
And it's really one of the great services that has been done in public.

34:21.238 --> 34:22.439
But, Nick, I didn't do it.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.241
It's all there.

34:23.801 --> 34:26.205
It's like Michelangelo said the statue's there.

34:26.505 --> 34:28.228
Well, true.

34:28.288 --> 34:31.532
To me, it'd be more like I found the cave with the treasures in it.

34:31.793 --> 34:33.235
Now, the cave's been there all the time.

34:34.597 --> 34:34.697
Okay.

34:36.263 --> 34:44.456
Too many people were repeating what other historians had said, and the other historians really hadn't bothered to go and really look at what this man was like.

34:44.476 --> 34:48.442
You see, I think you have to know what they were like.

34:48.462 --> 34:49.805
What were they like as a human being?

34:50.165 --> 34:56.575
The whole of history to me is about two mysteries.

34:58.859 --> 35:02.625
The mystery of time and the mystery of personality or human nature.

35:04.107 --> 35:08.311
And they are endlessly interesting.

35:08.351 --> 35:09.312
What is the past?

35:10.092 --> 35:10.933
What is the present?

35:11.033 --> 35:11.954
What is the future?

35:15.197 --> 35:19.381
What is this reality that we live in called time?

35:20.782 --> 35:21.643
What is long ago?

35:26.387 --> 35:31.391
If you've lost someone you love and that person's been dead for five years, that's long ago.

35:32.032 --> 35:33.253
That's a long time ago.

35:34.567 --> 35:43.677
If you're talking about human history, where they're pushing it back now, habitation in this continent, something like 16,000 years.

35:43.778 --> 35:52.087
I had a professor of geology at the college who asked us, I've never forgotten this.

35:52.107 --> 35:55.571
He said, imagine the Empire State Building.

35:55.591 --> 36:02.539
And on top of the Empire State Building, there's a Bible lying on its side, lying at the top.

36:02.559 --> 36:04.101
And on top of the Bible, there's a penny.

36:05.465 --> 36:08.108
The Empire State Building is geological history.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.852
The Bible is life on Earth.

36:12.573 --> 36:15.897
The penny is human life on Earth.

36:18.460 --> 36:25.207
And I think what history does is it helps us to see things in proportion.

36:27.870 --> 36:34.678
It helps us to see things in proportion, gives us a sense of proportion, sense of proportion.

36:36.329 --> 37:05.863
and it's an extension of the experience of being alive it just as art is or music is or poetry can be or literature i have to read so much just to know enough to do the work i'm trying to do that when i take time out to read for pleasure i very rarely read history or biography that to me would be just

37:06.080 --> 37:11.566
practicing my trade even when I'm supposed to be changing my thoughts.

37:11.586 --> 37:16.632
So I read, I read poetry and fiction and drama.

37:16.973 --> 37:18.755
I love Elmore Leonard like you do.

37:18.895 --> 37:20.337
Oh yeah, wonderful.

37:20.697 --> 37:22.239
Just wonderful.

37:22.259 --> 37:30.889
Well I was reading over that transcript of the talk I gave in Washington and boy I left a lot of books out of there.

37:31.223 --> 37:32.805
But I've had the nicest calls.

37:32.865 --> 37:35.607
I had a wonderful call from a... You left a lot of books out, you said.

37:35.627 --> 37:37.049
Oh, yeah, but I should have mentioned it.

37:37.069 --> 37:44.776
A wonderful call from an old friend who said, I didn't know you loved Jan de Hartog, the captain.

37:46.418 --> 37:47.999
And he was in World War II.

37:48.359 --> 37:52.904
And he said, that's the best book ever written about the war at sea, you know.

37:52.924 --> 37:56.007
And de Hartog was a wonderful writer.

37:56.167 --> 37:58.990
Oh, my God, what a writer.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.471
I adored that picture.

38:00.923 --> 38:02.345
The Cruel Sea.

38:03.587 --> 38:04.548
What a wonderful book.

38:04.568 --> 38:05.830
So when do you read for pleasure?

38:05.850 --> 38:06.591
At night?

38:06.831 --> 38:08.734
Night, weekends.

38:08.874 --> 38:09.836
And do you immerse yourself?

38:09.856 --> 38:10.777
I read all the time.

38:10.817 --> 38:13.821
Are you able to let the other stuff go for this?

38:13.861 --> 38:14.122
Yes.

38:15.003 --> 38:18.708
And I read... I love mysteries.

38:18.989 --> 38:20.231
I love good mysteries.

38:20.691 --> 38:29.023
I think some of the mystery writers, like some historians and biographers, ought to be perceived as writing literature, not just writing...

38:29.240 --> 38:31.063
history and biography and mysteries.

38:31.143 --> 38:31.744
I think P.D.

38:31.764 --> 38:33.667
James is a first-rate novelist.

38:34.468 --> 38:35.209
First-rate novelist.

38:35.229 --> 38:36.170
So is Ruth Rendell.

38:36.211 --> 38:37.372
These are terrific novelists.

38:38.314 --> 38:40.637
And they use the mystery form.

38:42.801 --> 38:48.850
I love letters, books of letters, and I love autobiographies.

38:49.751 --> 38:56.361
I just read a little book that Robert McNeil wrote, The McNeil of McNeil Lair.

38:56.662 --> 38:57.683
called Wordstruck.

38:57.883 --> 38:58.664
Have you read that book?

38:59.185 --> 38:59.365
No.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.768
Oh, Nick, it's just great.

39:02.649 --> 39:05.051
It's about his love of reading and love of the language.

39:05.171 --> 39:05.452
Is that right?

39:05.952 --> 39:13.060
And about growing up in Halifax during the war, and his father, who fought in the war, was, I think, the destroyer captain.

39:13.761 --> 39:14.542
Wonderful book.

39:15.102 --> 39:15.963
Published in the 1980s.

39:16.644 --> 39:20.969
I picked it up in a little, you know, out-of-print bookshop.

39:22.150 --> 39:26.635
And somebody said, maybe you know who it was, that

39:27.172 --> 39:30.496
Even the oldest book is new to him who opens it for the first time.

39:32.218 --> 39:32.699
I don't know.

39:32.839 --> 39:35.182
I saw it on a placard outside the library.

39:35.202 --> 39:36.684
I tried to find that for you.

39:36.704 --> 39:36.804
Yeah.

39:36.824 --> 39:37.545
It's not easy.

39:38.046 --> 39:38.747
I'm working hard.

39:39.067 --> 39:41.049
Tell me, by the way, what our time restrictions are.

39:41.109 --> 39:41.610
I don't know.

39:42.091 --> 39:43.092
I think we're being fed.

39:43.973 --> 39:44.173
Okay.

39:44.193 --> 39:47.297
But if it's okay with you, I'll write this up.

39:47.457 --> 39:48.719
Would you like to see this before?

39:48.759 --> 39:49.079
No, no.

39:49.380 --> 39:50.041
No, no, no.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.724
No, that's, I don't, no.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.347
I trust you totally.

39:55.788 --> 39:56.689
Because I'm...

39:57.175 --> 40:03.743
The only thing I would say, if you have any questions or anything you want to pursue, just call me up on the phone.

40:03.803 --> 40:05.345
You don't mind my picking up on a few things?

40:05.425 --> 40:06.367
Not you, not this.

40:06.387 --> 40:07.408
This is just fabulous.

40:07.448 --> 40:10.051
And given, of course, we have to have a comment on given.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.313
Oh, there's one of my favorite books.

40:11.653 --> 40:12.975
His autobiography.

40:13.556 --> 40:16.239
I would bet I've read that, I bet I've read it three times, easily.

40:18.402 --> 40:20.865
Because he tells us exactly how he read it.

40:20.885 --> 40:21.446
Oh, wonderful.

40:21.526 --> 40:24.470
Again, the use of the language.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.372
And that scene where he's finished,

40:26.808 --> 40:34.036
And he comes out, and he sees that there are leaves on the trees, and realizes that he's been in a spell.

40:34.076 --> 40:35.558
He's been lost in the work.

40:36.639 --> 40:37.660
I adore that book.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.945
If you had one burning question that you would ask John Adams, what would it be?

40:43.827 --> 40:46.570
Nobody alive knows him better than you, but I'm wondering.

40:46.790 --> 40:56.441
I usually ask people what they'd ask Shakespeare if they had the chance, but I think in your instance, maybe, you know.

40:56.461 --> 40:56.781
Okay.

40:57.166 --> 40:59.510
I'm sorry, curveball.

41:00.171 --> 41:10.006
I'm often asked if I could spend an hour with anybody or if I could have somebody as my friend and we drive across the country together.

41:10.046 --> 41:10.948
Who would I pick?

41:11.148 --> 41:11.769
Would it be?

41:11.829 --> 41:14.974
Yeah, would be.

41:14.994 --> 41:15.595
What would I ask?

41:15.655 --> 41:17.959
Well, what would you open with, I wonder?

41:18.901 --> 41:21.725
I usually think it's the one hour because that's what I usually get for an interview.

41:21.805 --> 41:27.092
I guess I would like to have him tell me much more about his mother and father and growing up out there.

41:28.173 --> 41:30.616
And what were these formative years like?

41:31.477 --> 41:37.125
If the mother was in fact illiterate, as you believe she was, do you think this in any way impacted the way he developed?

41:37.345 --> 41:46.056
Maybe he wanted, maybe it was so, you say he went to Harvard, discovered books and read for... Well, there's a passage in my book, which is from a letter of his,

41:46.542 --> 41:58.882
where I think he saw in his mother some of his own eccentricities, his capacity to flare up, lose his temper, and so forth.

41:59.743 --> 42:03.810
And then she sees that he really isn't cut out to be a preacher, a minister.

42:04.511 --> 42:13.866
So my guess is that he saw a lot of himself in her, some of which he may not have liked, but I think he also knew that she understood him.

42:15.888 --> 42:21.013
There has been a theory that he didn't like her because there are no letters to her.

42:21.314 --> 42:22.315
Well, she can't read.

42:22.355 --> 42:25.778
That's pretty obvious, yeah.

42:25.798 --> 42:28.821
You know, if you get that.

42:28.841 --> 42:31.544
I mean, Alexander the Great wrote to his mother they could both read.

42:31.564 --> 42:32.785
They're very simple things.

42:32.805 --> 42:42.655
You know, the visitors to the encamped soldiers around Boston during the siege of Boston, both Americans and the Brits, are astounded how dirty these men are.

42:43.356 --> 42:45.338
Well, they're dirty because they're out digging

42:45.537 --> 42:49.584
trenches and making breastworks and fortifications all day long.

42:50.084 --> 42:53.150
They're dirty because they're working in the dirt with their hands.

42:53.230 --> 42:56.615
And you have to understand the reality.

42:57.076 --> 42:59.059
Would you do my wife and myself?

42:59.079 --> 43:00.041
Oh, I sure will.

43:01.022 --> 43:04.869
Connie, and she, if anyone can claim to be... And what is her name?

43:05.009 --> 43:06.351
Connie, C-O-N-N-I-E.

43:07.193 --> 43:12.321
If anyone can claim to be more than me to be your greatest fan, it's my wife, I have to say.

43:14.647 --> 43:16.429
This is on tape, because this is important for me.

43:18.191 --> 43:19.993
This is the fourth interview you and I have had.

43:20.013 --> 43:39.675
I remember them, of course, but our first one, before I was even a book editor, was when Path Between the Seas came out on the telephone, and then I came to visit you at your home, you graciously, and I saw that old iron side, the .44 guns in your wall, and I went out and got three copies of that, and I had one of my father-in-law's houses, and my father-in-law's houses.

43:40.263 --> 43:50.333
So that was the 70s, and then we spoke again in the 80s on Teddy Roosevelt, and then we spoke in the 90s on Harry Truman, and here we are in the fourth decade talking about other things.

43:50.453 --> 43:55.537
And so I think of the many, many, many interviews I've done with authors over the years.

43:56.659 --> 43:57.079
Thank you.

43:57.199 --> 44:03.845
You're the first one to spend four decades, and every decade, and by far the best for me.

44:04.246 --> 44:08.169
And a model for what I try to do in my own work, may I say.

44:08.470 --> 44:09.831
Thank you very much.

44:10.098 --> 44:10.599
Thank you.

44:10.940 --> 44:15.912
If I can even approach what you do as a writer of narrative nonfiction.

44:15.932 --> 44:24.293
You do wonderful work in book publishing and authorship in your work.

44:25.117 --> 44:27.641
And if you don't mind, just a little one on that.

44:27.661 --> 44:29.544
This is a gem, I have to say.

44:30.104 --> 44:30.605
Thank you.

44:30.625 --> 44:32.388
I've had nice... You can see I've handled it.

44:32.408 --> 44:33.149
I apologize.

44:33.269 --> 44:35.472
All these notes in here, by the way, are my wife.

44:35.532 --> 44:38.497
She's always marking things at Philip Conn, page 618.

44:38.717 --> 44:39.518
That's her writing.

44:39.558 --> 44:40.540
Books, libraries.

44:44.205 --> 44:44.866
Oh, this is great.

44:45.207 --> 44:46.849
This has been very stimulating, sir.

44:47.050 --> 44:47.731
Thank you.

44:51.055 --> 44:52.778
I can claim...

44:54.260 --> 45:04.422
means it more to me, I think, than almost anything else about my work, is that all my books, none of my books has ever been out of print.

45:04.442 --> 45:05.003
Is that fabulous?

45:05.023 --> 45:05.304
It is.

45:05.925 --> 45:09.433
Over almost 40 years.

45:09.683 --> 45:13.451
Johnstown Flood was published in 1968, so it was 36 years.

45:13.751 --> 45:16.898
And the byline of that is David G. McCullough, by the way.

45:17.058 --> 45:17.639
I know.

45:17.700 --> 45:21.628
I dropped the G. Yeah, you dropped the D. I have a first edition of that, in fact.

45:21.888 --> 45:22.509
I'm pleased to say.
