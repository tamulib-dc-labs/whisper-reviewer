WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:09.355
For the thing to work, of course, I have to write as well.

00:09.395 --> 00:13.558
Read a couple of books that fill you in in the 20th century background.

00:13.598 --> 00:17.282
The Duked and Large Enough, Dave Rambo.

00:17.582 --> 00:20.705
Oak Knoll books in Newcastle, Delaware.

00:20.725 --> 00:23.007
I have a bibliography about books.

00:23.067 --> 00:24.849
Duked and Large Enough is great.

00:25.249 --> 00:26.650
The Rosenbach biography.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.472
I've already interviewed Ed Wolfe by the way.

00:28.992 --> 00:29.493
He's great.

00:30.273 --> 00:31.995
You know what Ed says on the record?

00:32.144 --> 00:37.330
He believes that Krauss was a better, was a more knowledgeable bookman than Rosenbach.

00:38.191 --> 00:39.072
I think he was.

00:39.213 --> 00:42.416
I think Krauss... I think Krauss could well.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.919
To have this come from Ed Wolff is unbelievable.

00:44.939 --> 00:46.321
I think Krauss could well have been.

00:49.205 --> 00:51.728
Krauss came over in the late 30s.

00:51.908 --> 00:54.591
Krauss would die for stock.

00:54.875 --> 01:01.162
Krauss would go to a sale like this and buy the things in his own inventory to dominate, control the market.

01:01.182 --> 01:09.411
And he began, Krauss got into it in the late 50s, a couple books of hours sales in London, Chester Beatty, and that's where the market came out of the depression.

01:09.451 --> 01:13.415
You can almost see in the late 50s the market going to go up.

01:13.435 --> 01:16.018
I mean, stuff looks dirt cheap compared to today.

01:17.179 --> 01:19.161
But Krauss was a major, major force.

01:19.698 --> 01:23.566
Rosenbach cross-handled very difficult groups.

01:24.828 --> 01:27.954
That, I mean, whether he was greater than Rosenbach... He didn't say greater.

01:27.974 --> 01:29.477
I think he said he was more knowledgeable.

01:29.497 --> 01:31.281
I mean, he made group greater than Taika.

01:31.301 --> 01:31.882
You know what I mean?

01:31.902 --> 01:37.032
In terms of knowing... In terms of knowledge... But then on the other hand, he said, you know, Dr. Rosenbach...

01:37.518 --> 01:38.800
was earned.

01:38.940 --> 01:42.085
He said, you don't ever think that that was, no, that PhD was earned.

01:42.105 --> 01:42.525
I don't know.

01:42.605 --> 01:43.987
I think Roosevelt did.

01:44.007 --> 01:47.573
I mean, Krause also had, I mean, hired fantastic people.

01:47.613 --> 01:51.899
Jack Fabian, those people who have been, who have produced his catalogs.

01:51.919 --> 01:55.204
Hans Krause didn't sit there and catalog that stuff.

01:55.224 --> 01:57.607
But he was a businessman, entrepreneur.

01:57.687 --> 02:01.753
Like, Thurman would want to be Krause.

02:02.392 --> 02:03.476
I can get in touch with you again?

02:03.797 --> 02:04.761
Get in touch with me.

02:04.801 --> 02:06.065
I'll give you some more emotional stuff.

02:06.085 --> 02:06.928
Okay, let's think about it.

02:06.949 --> 02:08.514
Are you going to come down to New York again?

02:08.554 --> 02:11.967
This is my third trip in the last week, so I'm happy.

02:11.987 --> 02:13.813
Yeah, because there's a couple stories that I do.

02:13.833 --> 02:14.275
I try to...

02:14.778 --> 02:18.865
I'll call you periodically.

02:19.085 --> 02:22.270
When's the best time to reach you?

02:22.410 --> 02:23.973
I'll be around last summer.

02:24.153 --> 02:25.495
You know, leave a message.

02:25.515 --> 02:26.697
If I'm out, just leave a message.

02:26.757 --> 02:27.418
I'll call you back.

02:27.559 --> 02:28.941
You know, you have no number?

02:28.981 --> 02:30.123
I got that 800 number.

02:30.143 --> 02:31.405
Let me give you this anyway.

02:31.425 --> 02:32.787
Did I give you this last time?

02:32.767 --> 02:35.754
And this is how you want to be?

02:35.774 --> 02:37.699
Yeah, but Bart Auerbach.

02:37.739 --> 02:39.162
But that's how you want to be identified?

02:39.263 --> 02:41.247
Yeah, because I'm talking as an individual, too.

02:41.308 --> 02:42.470
But I mean Bart Auerbach.

02:42.511 --> 02:43.794
That's your full name, Bart Auerbach.

02:43.834 --> 02:44.475
It's my full name.

02:44.535 --> 02:45.137
Oh, yeah.

02:45.197 --> 02:47.001
I mean, the business is Bart Auerbach Limited.

02:47.302 --> 02:47.984
And I got you.

02:48.024 --> 02:50.590
I have a 508-793-91.

02:50.570 --> 02:50.911
86?

02:51.793 --> 02:52.734
Is that your office or whom?

02:52.754 --> 02:53.536
Yeah, that's the office.

02:53.556 --> 02:54.318
Home is 839.

02:54.338 --> 02:56.041
9257.

02:56.582 --> 02:59.248
And I also have an 800 number at the newspaper.

03:00.050 --> 03:01.853
No, no, I got three hours.

03:02.274 --> 03:04.499
One other quick question.

03:04.940 --> 03:10.992
Do you think, in general, that prices for books reflect literary reputation?

03:11.967 --> 03:18.400
I'm thinking in particular of the Americana sale of Martin when you said $28,000 in your rice borough.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.386
There's a lot of stuff going on now.

03:21.546 --> 03:25.895
I talked to Gordon Ray about this some years ago.

03:26.235 --> 03:30.043
As you're getting a dilution,

03:30.547 --> 03:33.714
standards of education in America.

03:33.734 --> 03:44.076
You're getting new money that comes into the field, guys produce TV shows, guys produce movies, and they're even telling you in Hollywood nobody reads anything about that.

03:44.096 --> 03:47.644
So rather than anybody like Bob Puri, who

03:47.624 --> 03:54.220
Let's say you went to Harvard in the 50s and you begin with Spencer and you read your way through.

03:54.280 --> 04:05.127
People now are reading and like to collect the books and then something to them in their childhood teenage years that are on Channel 13, that are on PBS.

04:05.697 --> 04:10.242
They like, it's kind of pop culture coming into it.

04:10.262 --> 04:10.403
See?

04:10.423 --> 04:14.467
So that's the reason you have Frankenstein bringing $80,000.

04:14.808 --> 04:18.492
That's the reason you have Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Sherlock Holmes.

04:19.173 --> 04:19.854
Tarzan.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.956
Tarzan, Jack London.

04:22.737 --> 04:23.278
The Leibs.

04:23.338 --> 04:26.341
Kathy Leibs says easy books drive out the heart.

04:28.344 --> 04:30.126
Kathy Leibs, you might want to talk to her.

04:30.146 --> 04:30.826
It's the Leibs.

04:30.927 --> 04:32.308
I'll have to give you that phone number.

04:32.348 --> 04:34.771
They publish American Book Prices Courage.

04:34.911 --> 04:35.552
Oh, I know her.

04:35.532 --> 04:37.796
You know, she's good.

04:38.056 --> 04:39.900
She'll give you unbelievable quotes.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.001
She'll give you real stuff.

04:41.082 --> 04:43.185
I'm supposed to talk to her.

04:43.385 --> 04:49.216
Say, expand on what Bart Auerbach quoted from you about the easy, easy books driving out the heart.

04:49.636 --> 04:54.124
Meaning Stephen King driving out William Faulkner.

04:54.144 --> 04:56.768
Because Faulkner's too hard to read for most people.

04:56.789 --> 04:59.413
Look, there was a thing in the paper yesterday, CCNY.

05:00.237 --> 05:08.535
where one student said, look, you can't assign that book to me because it's not part of my life experience.

05:09.717 --> 05:18.516
So they're getting a watering down of educational standards in the United States.

05:18.648 --> 05:22.954
You, me, I give you people to tell, that's a given, that's a fact.

05:22.974 --> 05:29.322
Now, the reasons for it, we can argue about and explore, but it's a fact that it's happening.

05:29.342 --> 05:42.780
So somebody really trained, really brought up, and having read English literature, and having, you know, read Paul, read Swift, read Rodden, read the restoration tragedies, read Spencer, read Milton.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.581
This is going down.

05:43.622 --> 05:46.225
These are the white, what do they call them?

05:46.205 --> 05:49.115
white dead male poets.

05:50.199 --> 05:50.942
You see?

05:51.202 --> 05:55.658
And then it's the adventure stories, the popular stuff, the pop culture,

05:56.313 --> 05:58.856
Dickens, Hartley Collective.

05:58.876 --> 06:01.519
Dickens was an incredibly popular writer at the time.

06:03.921 --> 06:04.462
Melville.

06:05.243 --> 06:06.504
Post sunk down a bit.

06:06.524 --> 06:07.445
Melville's coming up.

06:07.465 --> 06:09.327
His prices were a little shaky.

06:09.648 --> 06:10.288
A little shaky.

06:10.349 --> 06:11.210
A little shaky.

06:11.230 --> 06:12.511
I mean, this isn't a hard time.

06:12.651 --> 06:14.493
I mean, they were high, but they didn't hit the lowest.

06:14.513 --> 06:15.394
They didn't hit, no.

06:15.414 --> 06:16.335
There were some others.

06:16.355 --> 06:18.878
For technical reasons, too, I think that Sotheby's

06:19.145 --> 06:23.091
We've been selling so much market in one year, just kind of flooded the market.

06:23.331 --> 06:26.716
Of Christie's, we probably would have spread a la Bohini over two years.

06:26.756 --> 06:28.659
Let the market absorb this stuff.

06:28.679 --> 06:32.745
It was supposed to be very rare, and here we're coming out with the last collection anybody can ever get.

06:33.226 --> 06:39.415
You see, so there's a lot of this popular stuff coming into the thing, detective literature,

06:40.103 --> 06:46.072
Jules Byrne, a manuscript of Jules Byrne, I bought for a collector in Coke for 45,000, 26-page manuscript.

06:46.112 --> 06:47.635
But it's Jules Byrne science fiction.

06:49.077 --> 06:49.738
You bought that elsewhere?

06:49.758 --> 06:50.459
I bought that for you.

06:50.479 --> 06:53.083
There's a collector in Santa Barbara.

06:53.123 --> 06:54.705
You're not doing manuscript collectors.

06:54.725 --> 06:55.507
Oh, I am, actually.

06:55.687 --> 06:55.967
You are.

06:56.088 --> 06:57.750
His name is Dave Karpolis.

06:58.832 --> 06:59.873
Is he Greek?

06:59.893 --> 07:00.114
No.

07:00.134 --> 07:00.775
I'm Greek, that's right.

07:00.975 --> 07:02.117
I think he's Jewish background.

07:02.538 --> 07:03.559
No, I'm Greek, that's all.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.823
K-A-R-P-L-E-S.

07:06.103 --> 07:06.804
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:07.705 --> 07:08.086
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:08.106 --> 07:08.727
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:09.010 --> 07:27.829
and i can i'll be talking to him today he's i bid for him he has a major he's a major major collector out he's in san diego in santa barbara i'm going out to l.a next month maybe you can go up and see him say you're writing a book about the book collectors about about you know collecting where is he in the book you can call him out of the blue

07:28.113 --> 07:29.194
And here's his number.

07:29.214 --> 07:30.536
That's the number I was dying with.

07:30.917 --> 07:31.537
Really?

07:31.617 --> 07:31.718
Yeah.

07:31.738 --> 07:34.101
He has a thing called the Carpetus Manuscript Library.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.143
There's two libraries out there.

07:36.163 --> 07:36.604
I've heard of this.

07:36.644 --> 07:37.725
He does exhibitions.

07:37.785 --> 07:38.606
Grendel knows them.

07:39.007 --> 07:40.549
Well, get background from Ken.

07:40.989 --> 07:43.252
I act as an agent bidding for him in New York.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.714
It's Dave Carpetus.

07:44.934 --> 07:45.475
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:45.495 --> 07:46.036
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:46.056 --> 07:46.376
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:46.396 --> 07:46.777
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:46.797 --> 07:47.498
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:47.518 --> 07:48.058
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:48.138 --> 07:48.659
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:48.679 --> 07:49.180
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-S.

07:49.200 --> 07:49.480
K-A-R-P-E-L-E-

07:49.561 --> 07:51.243
805-969-3983.

07:51.503 --> 07:55.888
He'd probably like a little publicity.

07:56.308 --> 07:57.309
He'd be very interesting.

07:57.329 --> 07:58.210
He's a self-made man.

07:58.310 --> 08:04.838
He began collecting in the Houghton sale in 1978, and he has a fabulous collection.

08:04.898 --> 08:13.527
I mean, he's a serious... With the death of Malcolm Forbes, Dave Carpetus could well be the leading American collector.

08:13.743 --> 08:22.177
I'm talking about paper.

08:22.337 --> 08:36.159
Dave buys everything from Scottish Armada archives, to music, to literary material, to exploration, even the real estate business.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.244
Mid-fifties.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.419
You interviewed Bart.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.342
You've been talking to Kenneth.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.664
All the major people.

08:44.385 --> 08:46.148
It's a random house book.

08:46.268 --> 08:50.615
And Bart said you have to talk to him.

08:50.715 --> 08:52.638
And if you go out there, he'll be very hospitable.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.820
Come up to Santa Barbara.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.022
He has two...

08:55.002 --> 08:57.104
Two museums in Santa Barbara.

08:57.124 --> 08:57.945
We're going out in July.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.848
We're going to see Bill South.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.430
South is a good friend.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.492
South is a fantastic friend.

09:03.512 --> 09:05.134
He's from the old store.

09:05.394 --> 09:08.057
Bill South is good.

09:08.117 --> 09:09.098
Have you ever heard?

09:09.119 --> 09:11.281
Talk to New Weinstein at Heritage Bookshop.

09:11.822 --> 09:16.127
His brother Ben was there today, but new is the real engine.

09:16.267 --> 09:17.428
That's in LA, right?

09:17.448 --> 09:17.729
LA.

09:18.389 --> 09:20.672
Heritage Bookshop, they're on...

09:21.007 --> 09:22.148
Mel Rose Avenue.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.872
He's been very good.

09:24.892 --> 09:27.495
I mean, he's a guy who's been around for 20 years.

09:27.535 --> 09:29.037
He can really talk about stuff.

09:29.878 --> 09:30.299
You see?

09:31.080 --> 09:32.221
He's been really wonderful.

09:32.802 --> 09:35.565
Some of the old dealers out there, Jake Zaitland has passed on.

09:35.585 --> 09:37.147
He was very important.

09:37.167 --> 09:39.691
That was too bad I missed that one.

09:39.711 --> 09:42.755
Mel Edelstein, who's at the Getty.

09:43.035 --> 09:45.478
He's an old-time collector.

09:45.458 --> 09:55.051
If you want to get a viewpoint from the library field, Mel Edelstein, he's at the Getty Center.

09:55.952 --> 09:57.495
I talked to Ricky Jay, by the way.

09:57.595 --> 09:58.336
Ricky Jay, by the way.

09:58.356 --> 09:59.577
All the trade loves Ricky.

09:59.637 --> 10:01.019
We all love Ricky Jay.

10:01.260 --> 10:01.420
Right.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.461
It's so great.

10:02.481 --> 10:04.744
He's so lively.

10:04.965 --> 10:05.666
He's good.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.367
He's got taste.

10:07.128 --> 10:10.993
Next year, there's a club we have in New York called The Old Book Table.

10:11.328 --> 10:12.049
The what?
