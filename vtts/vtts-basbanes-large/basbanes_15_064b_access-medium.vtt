00:06.190 --> 00:13.078
Thank you.

00:17.969 --> 00:42.762
One of the reasons was that the book, the Kennedys, had been so written that it was difficult to

00:45.577 --> 00:57.308
And the other difficult thing was President Kennedy set up a lot of obstacles.

00:57.541 --> 01:12.073
to things that really should be public, like archival sources, to introduce the people .

01:12.094 --> 01:16.343
So what kind of points do you and Scott come to the BBC, Jason ?

01:17.048 --> 01:23.899
I think that, you know, when you're dealing with the Kennedys, most literature, people aren't authors, they're anthologizers.

01:23.920 --> 01:30.751
So what you do is you find that you know the literature in order to look at what piece of water played from what book.

01:31.432 --> 01:36.701
And the great trick in this book was, in some sense, making the Kennedy story anew.

01:37.783 --> 01:39.726
And it really is, in a sense, it's like a myth.

01:40.668 --> 01:41.910
It has a myth to overcome.

01:42.010 --> 01:43.292
So if you know the story,

01:43.660 --> 01:51.232
the way that you know myth, and yet the story itself as it's told is really internally interesting.

01:51.252 --> 02:02.310
So for us, the really important fact was coming upon turning up really new kind of written sources as well as people sources.

02:02.442 --> 02:03.503
worked themselves out.

02:03.523 --> 02:07.188
We got to know the current Kennedy generation.

02:07.208 --> 02:12.795
I think what allowed the book to be the first time the Kennedys were told in the inside out.

02:12.815 --> 02:18.522
The first time you have a whole group of generation Kennedys commenting on what it is to be a Kennedy.

02:18.542 --> 02:19.944
So that's really important.

02:19.984 --> 02:24.289
There were really important papers, which were the wrong words, along the way.

02:24.309 --> 02:30.897
One of the things that we got was a cache of letters that Jack Kennedy wrote to his best friend in Warren Millings from the time he was

02:31.636 --> 02:39.563
about 14, until the time he came back from PT-109, is that really an incredible treasure trove of letters.

02:39.583 --> 02:50.593
It's the only example of Jack Kennedy's private correspondence that I think anybody's ever seen, and they're likely to see, because this man Billings, who died midway to the completion of our book, we had gotten copies of these letters.

02:50.613 --> 02:55.237
The first thing that happened when he died was Kennedy, and when it had burned, we read it.

02:55.257 --> 03:01.643
So had we not, just by some accident, gotten these copies, even these pieces

03:02.467 --> 03:16.085
And they give a completely different and original view of Jack Kennedy and allow us, I think, in this book to do what amounts to really a mini biography of Jack within the overall biography of the family.

03:16.646 --> 03:24.677
And I think it's a view of Jack that is appreciative of his past myth, his past legend, his past catalog.

03:24.843 --> 03:28.989
a bedrock appreciation, Jack, for what he was, not for what he was.

03:29.009 --> 03:34.698
He was a man who reconstructed himself for what he called a certain death when he was eight or nine years old.

03:35.138 --> 03:42.610
And these letters show him groping with his own mortality and the fact that he had what he was considered a terminal illness from the time he was a boy.

03:43.171 --> 03:50.281
They show him becoming the bookish, the internal Kennedy, the only member of that family that had a real interior dimension.

03:50.301 --> 03:53.466
So these are really quite a remarkable resource.

03:53.935 --> 03:55.819
You know, they're not the only thing we were able to turn up.

03:55.839 --> 04:06.203
We found that the members of the current Kennedy generation were remarkably willing to talk to us largely because this is a family of immense silences, immense gaps.

04:06.623 --> 04:08.387
Nobody talks to anybody in that family.

04:08.407 --> 04:09.811
They have so many closets in this.

04:10.472 --> 04:11.775
I mean, the guy was in the closet.

04:12.025 --> 04:35.805
they don't ever open them they don't dare open the members of their own family so you have a whole generation of kennedy the current generation and there's absolutely nothing about what it is to be a community that's why they weren't asking us that's right they you know they would come part of the reason that we were able to establish a react of relationship and here at last there's some people who knew what it was to be a kennedy

04:36.275 --> 04:55.355
not by personal experience, but they knew who the people were, what happened to them, what the history was, what actually produced it.

04:57.237 --> 05:00.561
You say the Kennedy family burned the billings.

05:00.963 --> 05:03.305
Letters are, or do they just make them inaccessible?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.349
Well, we already had one.

05:07.369 --> 05:11.913
Did they ever express why they were doing this?

05:11.933 --> 05:13.955
Well, we were just simply told that they did it.

05:14.035 --> 05:19.840
It's a natural kind of process of sanitization that goes on inside a historic family.

05:19.860 --> 05:28.388
I mean, there's a constant attempt to make the official history, and the way you make it is by kind of unmaking the sources to give contradictory views to the ones you consider

05:28.908 --> 05:31.891
to be the dominant music.

05:31.911 --> 05:39.921
The Kennedys, the thing about the Kennedys, any writer, any literary person immediately comes up against is that they consider themselves literarily savage.

05:40.641 --> 05:45.807
They've attained their present position largely because they know how to massage writers.

05:47.349 --> 05:53.656
So their first attempt is always to, in some sense, massage a writer, to bring them over to their side.

05:53.957 --> 05:56.940
They're incredibly conversant with the ins and outs of publishing.

05:57.494 --> 05:59.256
They made a big mistake in our case.

06:00.057 --> 06:07.847
They didn't learn from the Manchester Fair when they made a best-seller out of a book that would have no doubt been a best-seller.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.389
It would have been a mega-best-seller.

06:09.529 --> 06:15.196
They did it again in this case with our book, which would have been a kind of mid-range, good-selling book.

06:16.017 --> 06:26.290
They put it on top of the best-seller list for seven or eight weeks extra by their largely clumsy Tim Smith, the president, library.

06:26.450 --> 06:27.231
But...

06:27.481 --> 06:30.103
This is a family that really knows the ins and outs of publishing.

06:30.384 --> 06:35.328
And I think that they know how to make history.

06:35.348 --> 06:38.572
They know how to prune how to own history.

06:38.732 --> 06:43.336
Is it certain members of the family that is really up to what's going on or whatever?

06:43.356 --> 06:47.560
Or is it a collective group effort or is it a certain one?

06:47.580 --> 06:49.762
It's a very group effort.

06:49.782 --> 06:55.508
So there's one plus of all of them.

06:55.528 --> 06:57.049
There's one .

06:57.468 --> 07:03.134
And since they're perennially running the budget, the problem is they lost.

07:04.096 --> 07:07.039
Everybody is in line behind them.

07:07.059 --> 07:17.871
And one of the things they get between, like, you know, these letters, like the four letters, I mean, there's letters that are young, you know, a young man full of life and energy.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.856
They're really wonderful.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.037
One of them, for example,

07:23.017 --> 07:30.007
Jack wrote when he was in the hospital when he was 17 years old.

07:31.308 --> 07:38.378
And he said, I don't see them mentally measured in my coffin.

07:38.398 --> 07:41.883
Therefore, let him take gloves when he died.

07:42.204 --> 07:46.189
Well, this is a tremendous thing.

07:46.456 --> 07:55.856
a sickly young man, physically frail in a family that emphasized personal prowess.

07:56.016 --> 08:05.055
His second son, or the first son that his children were, could turn that, you know, those circumstances, which might depress life,

08:05.356 --> 08:15.288
to his advantage, to make a really wonderful, massive existence.

08:15.768 --> 08:19.353
So that people, when we interview people, they just love Jack Kennedy.

08:19.373 --> 08:26.681
You know, a lot of his girlfriends, and they all love to be in his presence because he's highly experienced.

08:26.702 --> 08:33.810
But the family, I think, you know, one of the themes of this family is that he's deaf.

08:34.111 --> 08:49.016
starting with the first son, dying in the war, have created martyrs in the family and then this kind of hominess to that that becomes really sexual.

08:49.036 --> 08:54.165
And so they suppress all of the humanizing, human aspects.

08:54.185 --> 09:00.135
And what our book has found is to rescue a person that came, you know, away

09:00.537 --> 09:20.688
If Jack Kennedy were alive today and running for president, would each of you vote for him?

09:22.511 --> 09:25.836
I voted for him for the first time.

09:26.288 --> 09:35.567
I might vote for him out of a sense of this kind of polymorphousness and out of a kind of appreciation for the artifact that he made himself.

09:35.587 --> 09:37.592
And he did make himself.

09:37.612 --> 09:40.197
When you see one of the things that we discovered

09:40.362 --> 09:59.893
there was really a tip-off about this family was that Hollywood had always played a very big role in this family's history from the time that the old man, Joe Kennedy, went out to Hollywood in 1929 as part of an ethnic breakout out of the confines of his Boston Irish mentality.

10:03.318 --> 10:07.905
This year the Library of America is tentatively entering the 20th century.

10:08.864 --> 10:09.925
How do you feel about that?

10:10.486 --> 10:21.718
Well, I believe that, you know, gradually our writers are slipped into the non-copyright territory.

10:22.839 --> 10:23.420
It's fifty years.

10:25.462 --> 10:31.528
And there's still, it seems to me, a lot of nineteenth-century books we haven't done that I'd like to do.

10:32.029 --> 10:32.850
Could you tell me a few?

10:33.010 --> 10:34.251
Pardon me for interrupting.

10:34.291 --> 10:37.875
Well, I mean, I think that

10:39.526 --> 11:08.723
A writer that nobody knows very much about, except teachers and students of American literature, but who has a great deal of interest in him, for example, in Italy and France, is Charles Boston Brown, our first novelist, who wrote a kind of an American Gothic tale, but of great psychological interest, and in many ways a more modern writer than the writers in the sense that he is talking about problems of

11:09.310 --> 11:18.202
point of view and psychological insight that are, it seems, more modern than many of the writers who came immediately after him.

11:18.883 --> 11:34.024
He wrote at times very powerfully, but sometimes the language is rather mannered in stillhood, but still a very important force, a great influence on Poe, on Hawthorne, on Melville, all wrote about him approvingly.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.547
And that's not very interesting.

11:36.567 --> 11:36.808
Yes.

11:36.948 --> 11:38.490
Now, Charles Rockin-Brown,

11:39.128 --> 11:44.375
When we publish him, which we will, he's not going to sell.

11:45.236 --> 11:48.080
There'll be a number of people who will buy him.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.221
Libraries will buy him.

11:51.804 --> 11:55.129
But those people who have all the copies will buy him.

11:55.149 --> 11:55.429
Yes.

11:55.870 --> 11:56.570
I suppose they will.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.712
But anyway, they'll discover him.

11:58.553 --> 12:02.738
And it will be—but we lose on that.

12:03.079 --> 12:06.283
We do better financially now, if we dare fall now.

12:07.023 --> 12:10.167
And we're doing a Faulkner, which is an original.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.911
Which is going to be a legitimate first edition.

12:12.931 --> 12:14.032
A legitimate first edition.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.156
And we're doing Flannery O'Connor.

12:18.277 --> 12:21.882
We're doing, going back a little earlier, we're planning Willa Cather.

12:24.405 --> 12:30.413
We're planning, eventually we'll do Sinclair Lewis.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.597
We have problems negotiating copyright.

12:34.558 --> 12:36.000
We have to pay a bit more.

12:36.706 --> 12:41.514
for our rights when we do contemporary writers.

12:42.876 --> 12:58.322
The point of it is, and I think you probably mentioned this before, somebody's told you, that some publishers who handle, who have the copyright for once important writers feel obligated to at least keep some of their books in print.

12:58.342 --> 13:01.167
But they make their sales on paperbacks.

13:01.187 --> 13:02.950
The people who own Hemingway

13:03.588 --> 13:06.472
Fitzgerald and all that, they make their money on the paperback.

13:06.492 --> 13:07.794
They don't make them on the hardcover.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.877
I don't even think they're all in print.

13:09.977 --> 13:10.758
And many they aren't.

13:11.219 --> 13:18.549
If they can allow us, since we don't go into paperback, to produce these books in hardcover, we leave them with a responsibility.

13:18.850 --> 13:19.551
And they make money.

13:21.654 --> 13:26.200
The idea is to try to minimize how much they are.

13:26.360 --> 13:26.941
That's right.

13:27.121 --> 13:31.047
And you see, we haven't done any of our rubric bargains yet.

13:32.967 --> 13:35.389
That was a term that I coined.

13:37.171 --> 13:58.372
That is to say, take an American writer who is only known for one book, and the other books are not sufficiently interesting, like Richard Henry Dana, Jr., two years before the Mass, a great work, one of the greatest stories of the sea.

13:58.392 --> 14:00.814
We can't have a whole volume on him.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.752
And you wouldn't want one, you think?

14:02.772 --> 14:03.454
We wouldn't want one.

14:03.754 --> 14:08.802
So we'll have a volume on great sea stories, of which his will be one.

14:09.864 --> 14:12.669
We want to do... We're talking about an anthology, perhaps.

14:12.689 --> 14:12.769
Yes.

14:12.789 --> 14:15.553
Well, not anthology in the sense because we're not excerpting it.

14:15.794 --> 14:17.957
They're complete works.

14:17.977 --> 14:18.718
That's important.

14:18.738 --> 14:19.580
Yes.

14:19.600 --> 14:28.354
So that we want to do, let's say, a great classic document with well-written, we always say...

14:29.515 --> 14:32.220
The criterion is literary merit.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.523
We just don't do documents.

14:34.184 --> 14:39.254
It could have been argued that you didn't have to commit an entire volume to Harry Biggesto, I think.

14:39.374 --> 14:41.238
Well, Harry Biggesto is another person.

14:41.358 --> 14:45.667
I think she has claims to be an important writer, apart from that.

14:46.529 --> 14:49.635
So that I think that that's not such much of a problem.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.338
But there are others that might be.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.101
Nature writers, for example.

14:54.382 --> 15:03.612
Or I want to do a volume which will include Progress and Poverty of Henry George and Looking Backward at Bellamy.

15:06.195 --> 15:08.138
We're also going to do some anthologies.

15:08.718 --> 15:12.383
We're working on a 19th century poetry anthology, because there is none.

15:13.224 --> 15:15.166
That will be, frankly, an anthology.

15:15.286 --> 15:19.671
We also want to do an anthology of 19th century short story writers.

15:20.343 --> 15:25.530
That will bring short story writers that people never heard of before, as well as poets.

15:26.271 --> 15:34.602
So in those media, we will break down our resolution not to anthologize and anthologize.

15:35.063 --> 15:36.625
Let's go back to the rubric then.

15:36.705 --> 15:49.422
The rubric then is hitting a subject like nature writing, historical exploration, voyages, philosophical writing, where the writers have

15:50.330 --> 15:56.759
are literary, and who have done books that would just be interesting to people.

15:57.339 --> 16:12.399
Not merely members of the... Well, no, I was thinking of what is the nature group that's always conservation, and you know that society.

16:14.462 --> 16:15.684
Sierra Club.

16:16.845 --> 16:17.326
Sierra Club.

16:18.227 --> 16:18.868
The point is...

16:19.068 --> 16:20.530
Look at our audience.

16:20.670 --> 16:39.317
We see our audience as a series of constituencies, not simply academic, not simply highbrow, but people who are interested in reading books, not necessarily the most philosophical and the dentist, but good stories, good adventure stories, meeting a certain level.

16:40.178 --> 16:41.320
We're doing Frank Norris.

16:43.483 --> 16:47.108
We've done Stephen Crane, people would say.

16:47.328 --> 16:47.809
But then...

16:48.295 --> 16:51.960
It's conceivable that we would do Booth-Tarkington.

16:52.361 --> 17:08.645
I can see collections or even volumes on writers that are not considered among the densest, heavy-thinking writers of that kind of thing.

17:08.665 --> 17:17.678
In time, I think we should have O'Hara, Marquand, and

17:17.945 --> 17:25.656
You told me that the suggestion of a Steinbeck had been rejected, but that's because of copyright problems?

17:25.817 --> 17:27.339
Yes, yes, at the moment.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.805
There should be a Steinbeck volume.

17:31.866 --> 17:33.848
He does not stand in the highest.

17:33.969 --> 17:34.910
No, certainly.

17:34.970 --> 17:35.651
Certainly, no.

17:35.691 --> 17:37.894
I personally enjoy him.

17:38.135 --> 17:41.680
Sure, but there should be, you see.

17:41.800 --> 17:47.749
But there are all kinds of general areas of subject by which there's been very good writing.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.272
That's why they call it a library of America.

17:51.593 --> 18:01.146
And how, in producing a comprehensive library of America, do you avoid being accused of literary slavery?

18:01.206 --> 18:03.770
We discussed this in our selection committee.

18:06.414 --> 18:16.588
And we know that there, we feel the first, our mandate is to make sure that what is generally considered good writing gets in.

18:16.957 --> 18:18.879
But then we extend the boundaries.

18:20.020 --> 18:25.665
Say, we'll have, we'll do, we'll have perhaps several volumes on American humor.

18:27.287 --> 18:33.392
Well, then perhaps you'll find some of the authors who you've already produced coming back again.

18:33.652 --> 18:34.453
Sometimes we do.

18:34.653 --> 18:40.038
To some extent we do this, and we do, there's a certain amount of duplication.

18:40.859 --> 18:46.204
For example, we're now planning to work on a volume on the Constitution.

18:47.568 --> 18:50.332
That's important.

18:50.772 --> 18:52.074
We're just working it out.

18:53.016 --> 18:54.698
Is it the writing, the literary?

18:54.978 --> 19:04.852
Well, I can't even tell you anything more than this, because we feel that we've done, of course, Jefferson.

19:04.872 --> 19:12.523
But let's say, and we're doing Franklin, but there's the Federalist Papers.

19:12.543 --> 19:15.567
It's Hamilton and Jay and Madison.

19:16.171 --> 19:19.896
There's brilliant pamphleteering writing done by the anti-Federalist favorites.

19:20.697 --> 19:40.744
Now, you might say these sound more documentary than literary, but these men were also good writers, and the letters that they wrote back and forth about the Constitution, we can make that, I think, in rather dramatic volume.

19:46.664 --> 19:50.628
the subject matter, so that the question is, then how long does the library continue?

19:51.869 --> 19:55.793
We planned the first thirty-five volumes.

19:55.813 --> 19:59.016
Now we think that we'd like—we're thinking, say, to a hundred volumes.

20:00.698 --> 20:01.158
I don't know.

20:01.198 --> 20:02.059
Why stop?

20:02.079 --> 20:02.880
Why stop?

20:02.900 --> 20:16.013
If it really becomes what I hope it will be, the sort of the national library, that is, so that anybody who wants to read

20:16.482 --> 20:28.624
The best kind of writing that has been produced, and most diverse, will find it in these really authoritative, permanent, well-made editions.

20:30.087 --> 20:31.369
Well, it's marvelous.

20:33.954 --> 20:38.482
One of those books you've done is a celebration.

20:38.542 --> 20:38.642
Yeah.

20:39.263 --> 20:41.426
We handle them with reverence here.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.710
Well, look at the newer Cooper.

20:43.850 --> 20:57.232
In a way, your response, which is very gratifying, of course, is to some degree the response of many people for whom there is a reverence for the book still.

20:58.714 --> 21:03.863
One would never have gathered that in some ways before our series came out because people were so cynical about it.

21:03.923 --> 21:06.587
But just the letters that we got and the joy...

21:06.972 --> 21:08.935
How about the response?

21:09.095 --> 21:18.288
I mean, I know almost to a person that the newspapers, the magazine, periodicals, the critics, whatever, and responded to that.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.472
I have not seen a sour note.

21:20.492 --> 21:33.250
I saw one sour note by some crusty guy who wrote a book for book collectors.

21:33.905 --> 21:34.746
Inexpensive.

21:34.806 --> 21:35.827
He's crazy.

21:36.387 --> 21:37.168
For what you get.

21:37.188 --> 21:39.190
For what you get.

21:39.850 --> 21:43.814
And the books are supposed to last, and apparently for three centuries.

21:43.874 --> 21:45.015
My God, give me a century.

21:45.595 --> 21:46.516
Give me two centuries.

21:48.017 --> 21:51.701
Let my daughters enjoy them, and one hopes their children enjoy them.

21:51.941 --> 21:52.421
Absolutely.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.883
Absolutely.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.145
That's a remarkable one.

21:57.906 --> 22:03.591
Commenting on the 20th century, I still feel that we should cover that a little more.

22:04.043 --> 22:07.128
Well, we have to wait, you see.

22:07.949 --> 22:12.537
What book's going to immediately come to mind?

22:14.380 --> 22:21.170
Our first thought was that there were books when we first started that were in copyright, but by, say, ten years from now we'll not be in copyright.

22:21.351 --> 22:22.633
We would move into those.

22:22.653 --> 22:27.160
I think it's also worth noting that Random House is working with you on this.

22:27.180 --> 22:31.587
Well, that happens by just accident, because Jason Epstein is vice president of

22:31.988 --> 22:33.851
That's a very happy coincidence.

22:33.871 --> 22:35.213
That's a very happy coincidence.

22:35.934 --> 22:47.332
But we think that we've got Paris Strauss and Giroux cooperating with the Flannery O'Connor.

22:47.352 --> 22:48.394
That's a very class house.

22:48.414 --> 22:52.961
Yes, and we're hoping that other publishing houses will do that as well.

22:54.945 --> 22:58.350
I really agree with Robert Giroux.

23:03.764 --> 23:04.785
I know he would.

23:06.447 --> 23:07.909
Do these writers get a new life?

23:09.050 --> 23:09.791
I think they do.

23:10.352 --> 23:12.354
Well, certainly Parkland did.

23:12.374 --> 23:17.440
We're doing Henry Adams in two volumes, the whole history.

23:18.962 --> 23:22.726
The Royal Harbor here at Northeastern University is the editor.

23:23.988 --> 23:25.630
And it's going to be stunning.

23:26.230 --> 23:31.797
Do you try when you select the list for a year, a given year?

23:32.350 --> 23:33.432
Do you try to have balance?

23:33.733 --> 23:34.033
Yes.

23:35.055 --> 23:41.948
And also, don't forget, we want to, we do one Melville volume, then we wait, then we bring out another Melville volume.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.852
We have to do that with some of our authors.

23:43.872 --> 23:45.595
We've only done one volume of Howells.

23:45.615 --> 23:46.978
We're going to do another volume of Howells.

23:46.998 --> 23:48.842
We want to get originally maybe four volumes.

23:49.763 --> 23:52.809
Gradually, we fill out the sets.

23:52.829 --> 23:54.472
Melville is virtually finished now.

23:54.733 --> 23:55.354
Melville.

23:57.190 --> 24:03.436
I imagine a lot of it is practical, but the stuff is edited and you have good editions of the works.

24:03.536 --> 24:04.077
That's right.

24:04.417 --> 24:06.519
But some of them, we have to make our own, you see.

24:07.199 --> 24:08.561
Yeah, you've done that in a couple of days.

24:08.581 --> 24:16.708
Yes, we're doing it for the thorough, partly because Princeton University Press refused to allow us to come to terms with it.

24:17.209 --> 24:19.992
I wonder why that— Well, that's entre nous.

24:20.412 --> 24:26.758
That's because Bailey, Herb Bailey, has been opposed right from the very beginning, predicted our failure.

24:27.515 --> 24:30.701
He said that we couldn't laugh, that paperbacks would drive us out.

24:30.721 --> 24:31.762
So now he's being spiteful.

24:32.223 --> 24:33.165
Yes.

24:33.185 --> 24:34.507
That's my word.

24:34.527 --> 24:36.631
Yes, but that's what Chris was never doing.

24:36.711 --> 24:37.713
Yeah.

24:38.414 --> 24:41.520
No, I don't look for such a recipe.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.481
I don't need it.

24:44.866 --> 24:46.408
We're really talking in general areas.

24:46.568 --> 24:50.856
I know you've got a ton of things in your mind today.

24:59.105 --> 25:03.530
It makes it doubly desirable for me to come here.

25:04.290 --> 25:06.673
If I have any other questions, would you mind if I give you a call?

25:06.993 --> 25:07.454
Not at all.

25:07.514 --> 25:08.274
Any time, Nick.

25:08.294 --> 25:15.081
I mean, I have my own views, and I guess they're all superlative on the life of America.

25:16.463 --> 25:25.332
I guess the one question I really haven't been able to articulate is the decision of what makes a classic.

25:25.497 --> 25:29.382
Are there any criteria?

25:30.063 --> 25:32.707
What makes a great work greater?

25:33.328 --> 25:47.588
Let me show you one thing that might be useful to you.

25:47.608 --> 25:49.911
Is that a fair?

25:50.311 --> 25:50.712
Yes.

25:51.552 --> 26:02.652
It was Edwin Wilson who felt that there ought to be a series of American writers that would be commensurate with the French play-out series.

26:02.672 --> 26:06.078
He was interested in American history at a time when a lot of his contemporaries weren't.

26:08.122 --> 26:15.535
And you look in the letters where he talks about them, even in the teens and twenties,

26:16.814 --> 26:21.999
And when he began to write about American literature, he found that the books that he wanted you just couldn't get.

26:22.019 --> 26:32.108
And so that prompted him, and I discussed this with him in 1960, if not before, and Jason did too.

26:33.569 --> 26:38.413
Well, he had made various efforts to get it funded.

26:38.894 --> 26:41.956
He came near it, but it was always something came up.

26:43.097 --> 26:45.960
And when the government, when the...

26:46.143 --> 26:52.151
The National Endowment for the Humanities decided to put the money into the scholarly editions instead of his editions.

26:53.052 --> 26:58.378
It was that that prompted his great explosion against the MLA, for which we had problems.

26:58.679 --> 27:01.082
We had to soothe all this afterwards.

27:02.484 --> 27:10.554
It looked as if it was finished until the Ford Foundation came to Jason and said, why don't you apply again?

27:10.594 --> 27:11.475
We believe in this.

27:12.434 --> 27:18.822
And then Jason got in touch with me and with Dick Poirier, and then we started.

27:19.062 --> 27:22.927
It's a very great moment, really, in American publishing history.

27:23.007 --> 27:23.348
Yeah.

27:23.528 --> 27:25.911
I mean, that's not hyperbolic, I think.

27:26.031 --> 27:26.632
It really is.

27:26.652 --> 27:28.033
It's a great moment.

27:28.494 --> 27:33.280
You must be very, very proud of what's happening.

27:33.921 --> 27:36.224
We've got thirty volumes, close to thirty volumes.

27:37.305 --> 27:37.986
Yeah, it's something.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.729
Failure was predicted.

27:40.749 --> 27:41.310
That's right.

27:41.797 --> 27:44.600
That's right.

27:44.620 --> 27:45.160
And here it is.

27:45.921 --> 27:46.922
Is it in the black yet?

27:47.042 --> 27:48.303
Oh, sure.

27:49.004 --> 28:00.535
We've been in the black, but what happens with this kind of a project is that we don't have a large cash reserve, so we have cash flow problems always.

28:00.555 --> 28:03.879
That is, while we're manufacturing the books, we get down to practically nothing.

28:04.219 --> 28:05.540
Then we swell up again.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.424
And then when we make new books, we go down again.

28:10.417 --> 28:14.382
There must be an imperative for you to get a popular book every once in a while.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.244
Every so often we have to do that.

28:18.127 --> 28:22.873
When the people will really want to... Yeah, but without violating our standards.

28:22.893 --> 28:23.233
Obviously.

28:24.115 --> 28:31.023
But I would like somebody to give me two million dollars.

28:32.045 --> 28:37.131
Then we wouldn't have a comfortable enough cushion.

28:37.151 --> 28:38.533
We'd always have enough reserves.

28:38.902 --> 28:45.749
To change the subject slightly, we did the Thomas Jefferson.

28:45.769 --> 28:47.370
You're doing the Franklin.

28:47.391 --> 28:49.332
Yeah, we're planning the Lincoln.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.634
You're planning the Lincoln.

28:50.654 --> 28:51.094
Very good.

28:51.134 --> 29:06.850
How about, Grant's memoirs have been described as some of the... Grant's memoirs have certainly been on our list.

29:06.998 --> 29:09.380
You're talking about Grant's memoirs.

29:09.400 --> 29:09.661
Yes.

29:10.341 --> 29:14.525
This is one of the books that we thought we'd do.

29:16.287 --> 29:17.248
The question is time.

29:17.528 --> 29:25.096
We plan maybe—we're up to three years from now we've got books scheduled.

29:25.116 --> 29:26.417
We have priorities, obviously.

29:26.517 --> 29:26.978
That's right.

29:28.099 --> 29:31.242
We're getting—there are all kinds of criticisms that can come in, you see.

29:32.203 --> 29:34.545
The women, the feminists, are very much concerned.

29:34.785 --> 29:36.567
You mentioned that.

29:37.238 --> 29:40.781
What are they charging?

29:40.801 --> 29:41.502
Well, they don't know.

29:42.963 --> 29:55.334
Just, again, there was a meeting in Hartford, and a friend of mine was there, and one of the famous came up and said, you know, the American Library has planned its program for the next ten years.

29:55.654 --> 30:03.121
There's not one single woman in it, and we're going to make a protest on the basis of this crazy information.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.604
But the question does come up, is there a...

30:06.972 --> 30:10.156
a masculine emphasis on the literary canon.

30:10.937 --> 30:12.118
And are we doing it, you see?

30:12.699 --> 30:13.300
I don't believe it.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.241
I don't believe there is.

30:14.261 --> 30:16.784
And we're doing, we're planning women writers.

30:17.485 --> 30:20.890
We're doing, look, we're doing Edith Wharton's coming up.

30:20.910 --> 30:23.313
We're going to do Willa Cather, Flannery O'Connor.

30:25.215 --> 30:27.898
Well, is this a literary response or a political response?

30:27.979 --> 30:28.459
Political.

30:29.540 --> 30:30.482
Political literary.

30:31.263 --> 30:31.923
There's a question.

30:31.984 --> 30:33.666
You have to acknowledge its existence.

30:33.706 --> 30:34.266
Absolutely.

30:34.587 --> 30:35.528
Place it, answer it.

30:36.419 --> 30:40.523
So there are lobbies developing in other words.

30:40.543 --> 30:40.663
Yes.

30:41.824 --> 30:44.467
And I imagine we'll have a black writer's lobby.

30:44.707 --> 30:45.949
We're doing a W.A.B.

30:45.969 --> 30:46.749
Du Bois.

30:51.694 --> 30:52.575
Just one other thing.

30:54.397 --> 30:56.159
You have a screening committee you'd say.

30:56.279 --> 30:57.640
Is it very large?

30:58.561 --> 31:00.103
It's about seven or eight people.

31:01.464 --> 31:06.409
Now you must have certain writers who you don't like personally.

31:07.250 --> 31:13.017
Well, there are lots of writers that I don't particularly care for, but that wouldn't alter that.

31:13.398 --> 31:13.658
No.

31:13.979 --> 31:21.188
So you try and separate your literary judgments, shall we say, from the imperative to get certain authors.

31:21.428 --> 31:22.489
Sure, that's right.

31:22.509 --> 31:24.172
I mean, I wouldn't... I'm not saying that.

31:24.192 --> 31:24.392
Yes.

31:24.452 --> 31:32.843
For example, that popular novel, In His Steps, that was a great bestseller.

31:32.883 --> 31:34.725
We don't show them bestsellers, you see.

31:35.380 --> 31:42.206
which is a sentimental evangelical novel and very badly written.

31:43.908 --> 31:45.309
Gene Stratton Porter.

31:45.329 --> 31:46.790
You could think of all kinds of writers.

31:46.910 --> 31:47.851
Interesting question.

31:47.951 --> 31:50.714
Do we take into account the bestsellers of the period?

31:51.094 --> 31:52.716
Not necessarily, no.

31:53.817 --> 31:58.481
Well, let's say a bestseller would be Judith Krantz.

31:59.082 --> 32:00.383
That's what I want you to tell me.

32:00.743 --> 32:00.983
No.

32:01.704 --> 32:05.067
We're at that kind of writing, you see.

32:05.502 --> 32:09.586
I mean, that is written just for that kind of market.

32:10.787 --> 32:22.859
But who's to say that the feminists could say, look, there were a lot of popular women novelists in the 1860s, 70s, and nobody read them.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.963
Now we go back and find they're of interest.

32:26.103 --> 32:31.648
Well, you could almost find a lobby to support Margaret Mitchell.

32:31.668 --> 32:32.149
That's right.

32:32.649 --> 32:33.450
Oh, absolutely.

32:33.869 --> 32:34.730
Absolutely.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.292
And they might win out, too.

32:36.632 --> 32:37.213
Absolutely.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.115
But is it a great novel?

32:39.135 --> 32:39.836
I don't know.

32:39.856 --> 32:43.401
Yes, but we couldn't do Margaret Mitchell.

32:43.841 --> 32:44.742
She did one more work.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.444
She fits into that category.

32:46.504 --> 32:53.593
If we had a collection of great Civil War novels, should she be in it, you see?

32:53.913 --> 32:54.414
Probably.

32:55.836 --> 32:59.721
Although I would present it.

32:59.861 --> 33:01.783
I was criticized for it.

33:02.573 --> 33:04.595
Well, I think it's a very bad novel.

33:04.676 --> 33:05.156
I do too.

33:05.897 --> 33:09.361
But I wrote about that in The Unwritten War.

33:09.381 --> 33:12.184
Yeah, we've got that.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.106
Don't call that.

33:13.206 --> 33:16.630
I've got a lot of time to write this piece.

33:16.730 --> 33:19.253
It'll be a lot of work to do.

33:19.553 --> 33:20.254
I'm going to let you go.

33:20.374 --> 33:21.856
I know you're very good.

33:21.996 --> 33:26.442
Well, I'm going to go and probably go and see my wife just a moment, okay?

33:26.462 --> 33:27.723
There's nothing else that you think I can?

33:27.743 --> 33:28.884
I can't.

33:28.904 --> 33:30.767
Oh, yeah, you used to try it all the time when I first came out.

33:30.787 --> 33:31.888
I was going to try it the most.

33:32.223 --> 33:57.049
you know but then it was like somebody come up and try to put a lot of money on my eyes and try to figure out a lot of money so i said you know that bothers me the fact that they know that large amount of money they say i have to decrease your relationship with your parents now or i love them definitely i said any child man or woman that don't love their mother's father i tell me i said the man don't think a man make a good husband if you don't love his mother's father and i said

34:01.940 --> 34:04.964
That's the first call.

34:07.026 --> 34:09.729
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

34:09.749 --> 34:10.570
How are you doing?

34:10.711 --> 34:11.231
How are you doing?

34:11.812 --> 34:12.773
It's the radio.

34:12.913 --> 34:13.514
How are you doing?

34:14.115 --> 34:14.996
It's the radio.

34:15.016 --> 34:15.656
It's the radio?

34:15.837 --> 34:17.178
Barbara, say something to the radio.

34:17.198 --> 34:20.923
I want to come on.

34:20.943 --> 34:22.144
I want to come on tonight.

34:22.164 --> 34:23.786
Want to hear yourself talk?

34:24.767 --> 34:28.192
You know, the record didn't become bold.

34:28.212 --> 34:29.133
But like I said, you did it.

34:29.153 --> 34:31.516
Even if Dad could have a five or six.

34:31.536 --> 34:31.896
Say something?

34:32.197 --> 34:33.098
Yes.

34:33.118 --> 34:33.579
Say something.

34:33.619 --> 34:34.400
Say, hi, Mommy.

34:35.342 --> 34:35.662
Hi.

34:36.043 --> 34:36.904
Hi, Mommy.

34:36.924 --> 34:37.906
Hi, the radio.

34:38.306 --> 34:38.807
It's not radio.

34:38.847 --> 34:39.709
It's a tape recorder.

34:40.951 --> 34:42.673
Can you do the alphabet?

34:43.054 --> 34:43.354
Uno.

34:43.675 --> 34:43.915
Uno.

34:44.196 --> 34:45.317
Do it.

34:45.638 --> 34:47.441
Can I press button?

34:47.461 --> 34:47.541
Uno.

34:47.561 --> 34:48.282
Press button.

34:48.682 --> 34:52.088
You want to press the button?

34:52.428 --> 34:53.209
Yes.

34:53.229 --> 34:54.471
Here, press that button right there.

34:56.154 --> 34:57.115
No, this button right there.

34:58.117 --> 35:00.060
How they can solve their problems in this world.

35:00.395 --> 35:01.196
That's very good.

35:01.276 --> 35:05.121
You know, everywhere I go, the adults always ask me that question.

35:05.141 --> 35:05.762
Never the kids.

35:05.782 --> 35:06.383
The kids know.

35:06.764 --> 35:08.025
You can't fool children.

35:08.065 --> 35:11.590
And we try to cover up and say, come on, ask this question for my son.

35:11.630 --> 35:12.271
He's not here.

35:12.792 --> 35:14.474
Kids know the difference.

35:14.534 --> 35:17.298
Kids know when parents say, oh, the A-team is too violent.

35:17.318 --> 35:18.680
I just, blah, blah.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.883
You're going to follow the show on TV at 6 o'clock noon.

35:20.903 --> 35:21.464
Who are we fooling?

35:22.104 --> 35:25.930
But kids know that if I want to hit a man with all the rings, I got to be blood all over the screen.

35:26.450 --> 35:27.211
That's entertainment.

35:27.231 --> 35:27.752
That's theater.

35:28.002 --> 35:28.963
Until I get a wrestler.

35:28.983 --> 35:29.584
That theater.

35:29.744 --> 35:32.007
That was another avenue for me to reach people.

35:32.028 --> 35:33.630
When you reach the kids, my message still was the same.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.534
I said, I'm going to beat these bad guys up until I can do anything.

35:36.994 --> 35:39.077
When the kids was listening and whatnot, I said, don't forget it.

35:39.658 --> 35:40.619
Say your prayers tonight.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.201
Don't hang with the wrong crowd.

35:42.221 --> 35:42.722
Don't do drugs.

35:43.143 --> 35:43.844
Stay in school.

35:44.725 --> 35:45.786
Even though he was a fan for wrestling.

35:45.967 --> 35:46.948
My message still was the same.

35:47.589 --> 35:48.670
So it didn't take nothing from me.

35:49.511 --> 35:51.074
It just gave me a wide audience.

35:52.516 --> 35:53.377
My message still was the same.

35:53.397 --> 35:54.358
I'm beating up bad guys.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.541
Not just jumping in, just jumping in there.

35:58.006 --> 36:03.194
I'm glad you brought that up, ma'am.

36:03.214 --> 36:09.364
You know, I told my agent, he's been bothering a lot of stuff.

36:09.424 --> 36:12.569
I said, I am tired when you talk about being tired and weary.

36:12.589 --> 36:17.297
He goes, Mr. T, would you do this?

36:17.317 --> 36:17.938
Would you do this?

36:18.205 --> 36:20.387
You're talking about taking advantage of the situation.

36:20.407 --> 36:21.728
That's taking advantage of the situation.

36:21.748 --> 36:26.853
And I challenge every parent, if they were to do their job, they wouldn't have to rely on Mr. T. They wouldn't have to rely on Michael Legend.

36:27.093 --> 36:28.615
They wouldn't have to rely on Henry Winkler.

36:28.635 --> 36:30.377
So you don't escape those.

36:30.397 --> 36:33.379
Mr. T, when you come to the hospital, they misuse what Mr. T is about.

36:34.160 --> 36:34.901
I'm not Jesus.

36:35.662 --> 36:37.623
He said, oh, yeah, I wouldn't like my father's in the hospital.

36:37.744 --> 36:38.364
I wouldn't see him.

36:38.384 --> 36:40.026
Or a lot of children, you know, they would love to see you.

36:40.226 --> 36:42.708
They missed the whole point of what I'm about.

36:42.728 --> 36:44.550
So he said, why don't you speak up for this, speak up for that.

36:45.121 --> 36:49.345
Now, if parents do their job, they might never worry about no celebrity to do something else.

36:50.607 --> 36:54.370
You know, because I was brought up with love and respect that I had for my own mother and father.

36:54.390 --> 36:55.171
I grew up in the ghetto.

36:55.291 --> 36:56.493
Some drugs all around me.

36:56.693 --> 36:58.715
Everybody getting high, not going to school.

36:59.476 --> 37:01.618
But I said I wanted to be something.

37:01.798 --> 37:04.381
So it wasn't for me.

37:04.501 --> 37:07.083
So I didn't have no problem with it.

37:07.103 --> 37:09.206
I don't even have no problem with it.

37:09.226 --> 37:09.906
Any last question?

37:09.926 --> 37:12.269
We're five minutes over, but this man is absolutely captivating.

37:12.289 --> 37:13.110
One last question.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.571
So he's saying, like, when you hear some of that

37:17.690 --> 37:23.339
Well, I tell them, I've been running with people like that for talking, so, man, you know what you're talking about.

37:23.359 --> 37:25.602
I say, you're right, my message is not for everybody.

37:25.622 --> 37:30.550
Everybody likes to know what you're listening, Mr. T. So I'll tell you, you see, well, man, please, I'll say, you're right, be a bum.

37:30.570 --> 37:32.653
I want to waste my time right now.

37:32.673 --> 37:33.715
Right, I want to waste my time.

37:33.735 --> 37:36.158
I want to be where somebody is going to need to hear what I got to say.

37:36.579 --> 37:40.445
So, man, get on out, you don't want to hear this stuff.

37:40.465 --> 37:41.486
I'll say, you're right, I'll leave.

37:41.507 --> 37:42.768
I was in a jail for about 1,000 inmates.

37:42.788 --> 37:44.251
I don't want you here to bring that garbage here.

37:44.271 --> 37:46.414
I'll say, you're right, I won't be that.

37:46.934 --> 37:52.387
You know, Mr. King, I have one question I'd like to ask.

37:52.407 --> 37:57.058
Key and students are just 300%.

37:57.118 --> 37:58.120
Why is that?

37:58.241 --> 37:58.441
Parents.

37:59.724 --> 37:59.884
Parents.

37:59.904 --> 38:00.065
Parents.

38:00.085 --> 38:01.087
But we don't need to teach as a parent.

38:01.107 --> 38:01.588
As a parent.

38:01.608 --> 38:02.310
As a parent.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.976
If somebody wants to kill them, I'll let them kill them.

38:04.996 --> 38:10.223
I love life too much, you know, because the parents, they got to get more responsible than kids.

38:10.243 --> 38:12.526
Like I said, money can't bring love.

38:12.566 --> 38:19.775
Like watching Hollywood, the parents, they leave their house for the weekend, leave the kids, 16, 17-year-old, in the house, and they have parties and drugs and everything.

38:19.795 --> 38:22.098
Kids, watching their parents, they're getting tired and all that.

38:22.138 --> 38:23.140
You know what I mean?

38:23.180 --> 38:25.703
This team will stick out against suicide.

38:25.723 --> 38:26.244
So I ain't started.

38:26.384 --> 38:26.825
I don't even know it.

38:26.845 --> 38:27.365
That's just the parents.

38:27.385 --> 38:32.432
If the child's in the house and the parents, the parents got to become more loved, more efficient with the children.

38:33.458 --> 38:51.972
You know, there's too much of a gap there between a friend and a child.

38:51.992 --> 38:52.253
We thank you.

38:52.273 --> 38:52.674
We thank you.

38:52.694 --> 38:55.078
Congresswoman understands.

38:56.020 --> 39:04.533
I've been assigned at 12 o'clock, which is precisely the length of a Sunday homily.

39:06.456 --> 39:13.568
The congresswoman said she was up to go to 6.30 mass this morning, and fortunately she said it was a mass without a homily, so it didn't take very long.

39:13.668 --> 39:19.317
I said, if you're not going to escape, you're going to hear another homily anyhow.

39:20.318 --> 39:23.884
As the chairman said, I do a number of different things.

39:24.185 --> 39:27.048
though we needed all ways of being a priest.

39:27.068 --> 39:31.953
But when you do a number of different things, you have lots of different perspectives.

39:31.973 --> 39:46.107
And every time I think of the diversity of perspectives that exist in the human condition, I'm reminded of that wonderful flowering of the acumenical spirit, the priest-rabbi jokes.

39:46.127 --> 39:51.492
The rabbis always win, so you know which ethnic group makes them up.

39:55.285 --> 40:04.534
But anyhow, once upon a time, long, long ago, last summer that is, a priest and a rabbi were traveling in Ireland together.

40:05.535 --> 40:08.058
And they became very good friends.

40:08.879 --> 40:10.821
They took a bit of the creature now and then.

40:11.441 --> 40:17.647
This one particular afternoon, they'd been eating a long lunch in a cafe in the county Broadway.

40:18.308 --> 40:23.233
And the creature was taken in considerable amounts and they were feeling very mellow.

40:23.585 --> 40:31.793
And they went out for a walk in the lanes and the hills of the county Galway as the sun sank over Galway Bay into the mists.

40:31.813 --> 40:36.017
And the priest said, Rabbi, he said, ah, he said, sure, Rabbi.

40:36.037 --> 40:39.980
He says, it is clear to me that you're a wondrously devout man.

40:40.000 --> 40:45.205
He says, I'm terribly impressed by the way you keep all them awful dietary rules.

40:45.806 --> 40:47.207
He says, but now tell me, Rabbi.

40:47.227 --> 40:48.989
He says, man, the marriage is true.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.070
You don't keep them all the time, do you?

40:51.090 --> 40:51.651
He says, for example.

40:52.154 --> 40:54.556
Have you ever in all your life eaten ham?

40:56.118 --> 40:59.561
Father, Sister Rabbi, what can I tell you?

40:59.581 --> 41:01.563
Very pleasurable question.

41:01.583 --> 41:02.424
Ah, sure, Sister Priest.

41:02.985 --> 41:04.286
I have seen the confession.

41:04.406 --> 41:05.567
I won't tell the soul.

41:06.488 --> 41:09.991
Seen the confession, Father, Sister Rabbi.

41:10.011 --> 41:11.173
Seen the confession, Sister Priest.

41:11.313 --> 41:15.377
Well, Father, Sister Rabbi, once, when I was young, I was in college.

41:15.497 --> 41:16.318
I was curious.

41:16.798 --> 41:17.599
I was hot, Father.

41:17.619 --> 41:20.622
I admit, Father, I confess.

41:20.642 --> 41:21.823
I ate a ham sandwich.

41:22.613 --> 41:49.347
well she's the priest sure she's bravely as we admit it now it's no more than a venial sin the priest lived back in the year old when we catholics had venial sins we had more of a sense then too well let's talk about that here um but he says this is very bravely as we admit it um but father sister he says now fast fast he says son tell me he says father

41:49.816 --> 41:54.422
Have ever, in all your life, have you ever gone to bed with a woman?

41:54.442 --> 41:55.503
Oh, sure, Sister Priest.

41:55.543 --> 42:00.409
That's a terrible personal question to be asking, did I ever go to bed with a woman.

42:00.429 --> 42:04.594
Oh, say a confession, Pastor.

42:04.614 --> 42:05.956
You won't tell me, Archbishop.

42:06.036 --> 42:08.359
Say a confession.

42:08.379 --> 42:13.625
Well, Sister Priest, sure, I was young, too, and I was curious, and ah, the blood was hot.

42:13.645 --> 42:17.410
Well, yes, one night when I was in college, mine was just out of curiosity.

42:17.643 --> 42:21.608
I did spend the night in bed with a woman.

42:21.628 --> 42:29.417
And she would come around and beets ham, doesn't it?

42:31.660 --> 42:41.592
And first of all, I want to describe a couple of clichés that I find abounding, though not as many books, but I find abounding in the cultural capital of the world, I should say Midtown Manhattan.

42:41.977 --> 42:51.051
And then comment on those myths from the point of view of the empirical research my colleagues and I have done on the American Catholic population.

42:51.712 --> 42:55.097
There is sort of three kinds of images.

42:55.117 --> 42:57.782
One image is of the nostalgic Catholic.

42:57.802 --> 43:03.090
This is the kind of Catholic you're likely to encounter in midtown, not in Queens, but in midtown.

43:03.110 --> 43:08.338
And it's the Catholic who remembers growing up Catholic with nostalgia.

43:08.791 --> 43:19.184
the good old days of Sister Mary holding water and patent leather shoes, all those marvelous things, which unfortunately have died, and we missed them, but of course you can't really be serious and believe those things.

43:19.665 --> 43:24.271
And so we drift through life in a kind of alienated, nostalgic haze.

43:25.312 --> 43:36.587
That's one image of what Catholics are like, and you can understand why both publishers and media types have that image because most of the Catholics they meet in their cocktail parties are that way.

43:37.158 --> 43:56.801
The second image is of the devout Catholic masses, not all that well-educated, but timidly cling to their faith, shocked every time there is a new revelation, a new scandal, a new battle of Rome, a new pronouncement from the Pope.

43:57.141 --> 44:07.013
People who may be the last generation of their family that could possibly keep up the pretense of being Catholic, only then and only because they're still

44:07.111 --> 44:11.477
fundamentally conservative, and they don't think too much for themselves.

44:12.718 --> 44:24.654
Forty percent, by the way, of college-educated Protestants in the Northeast who describe themselves as liberals think that Catholics, typical Catholic, doesn't really think much for himself.

44:25.555 --> 44:27.938
Now, one adds to that the third myth.

44:28.660 --> 44:36.174
The wonderful headline that Jimmy Breslin says, it's sort of typical of what the treatments Catholics get in the New York Times newspaper.

44:36.515 --> 44:40.463
He says, the headline says, more enormously than Convent this year than ever before.

44:41.605 --> 44:43.589
He says, that's the way it is.

44:43.649 --> 44:46.374
But it happens that way in the New York Times newspaper, so it's Jimmy Breslin.

44:46.454 --> 44:50.061
Now, to give the Times fair credit, he said that in an article in the New York Times.

44:50.530 --> 45:19.862
Finally, there is the myth of Catholic conservatives, the myth that, without going into details, is summed up marvelously by, say, the film Joe or the film about Mr. Goodbye, the conservative, chauvinist, hawkish, militarist, racist, white ethnic Catholic, the kind of person who obviously stampeded to the rating ticket both in 1980 and 1984.

45:20.534 --> 45:32.552
for which class the difference is up, particularly if they were Catholic.

45:32.572 --> 45:41.306
Okay, those are, in the very crude outline, 12 minutes, the myths about American Catholics, the facts.

45:42.588 --> 45:48.617
Catholics now, at the college-going age, are one and a half times as likely to go to college as our typical white American.

45:49.087 --> 45:53.873
The Catholic upper middle and professional class is expanding at a prodigious rate.

45:54.754 --> 45:57.257
And the rate of expansion is increasing.

45:57.958 --> 46:10.314
The shift from immigrant slums to professional class suburbs or the social equivalent of that is going to go on more rapidly even for the rest of this century than it has done since 1960.

46:10.334 --> 46:13.558
On the political side of it,

46:13.657 --> 46:20.284
Carter Mondale ticket got 45% of the Catholic votes, so did the Ferraro Mondale ticket.

46:20.404 --> 46:24.689
There was no noticeable shift of American Catholic voting from 1884.

46:24.769 --> 46:33.559
Too bad it didn't shift the other way, but nonetheless, Catholics were not the ones that he voted from Democratic voting between 1884 and 1884.

46:33.579 --> 46:42.128
Moreover, the majority of American Catholics think that more money should be spent on the Florida, 15% of his points more likely to think back than white Protestants.

46:42.513 --> 46:48.183
70% of American Catholics are in favor of an immediate negotiation for nuclear freeze.

46:48.203 --> 46:53.612
65% of American Catholics are opposed to any American troops in Central America.

46:53.632 --> 46:58.260
And all of these matters, you know, Central America nuclear freeze helped before.

46:58.721 --> 47:05.753
There's no statistically significant difference between the position of Catholics and the position of Jews, and both are anywhere from 15 to 20% points.

47:06.104 --> 47:09.628
more liberal on these issues than our white American Protestants.

47:09.748 --> 47:24.664
Now, depending on your political position, this may be good or bad, and I'm not necessarily endorsing, I'm just saying that's the way it is, and the myth that the Catholic population being uneducated and conservative simply does not fit the empirical evidence.

47:24.684 --> 47:32.652
Moreover, while there was a sharp decline at 15 percentage points in weeks of church attendance for American Catholics between 69 and 75,

47:33.087 --> 47:47.821
That decline has stopped in 75, and American Catholic church attendance is going right across the page at 50%, just like Protestant church attendance has since 1940, going across the page at 40% every week.

47:48.782 --> 47:59.652
And then, moreover, the decision made in the late 60s by about half the Catholic population to stay in church even though it rejected the birth control

48:00.374 --> 48:03.137
is a decision based essentially on loyalty.

48:03.837 --> 48:07.200
Let me illustrate what I mean by loyalty.

48:07.501 --> 48:22.374
Those Catholics who described themselves as strong Democrats or strong Republicans, those people who could be in the latter category, too many, there was no change in their church attendance pattern between 69 and 75.

48:23.035 --> 48:28.660
All of the change in church attendance went on among those who described themselves as independence.

48:29.112 --> 48:32.638
You are loyal to the party and you are loyal to the church.

48:32.658 --> 48:34.321
You leave the church, you leave the party.

48:34.881 --> 48:46.501
Reminds one Pat Whitehead's joke about Councilman Murphy became a Republican and one of the women were praying, no, I couldn't, I saw him in church last Sunday.

48:46.521 --> 48:54.073
The leadership of the church, the leadership of the Democratic Party has not really been able to drive the rank and file out of either.

48:54.678 --> 49:10.136
Church attendance and affiliation with the party are linked in what we sociologists call latent substructure, latent factor, which can be called loyalty.

49:10.516 --> 49:15.301
Moreover, this loyalty is not something that's passing away with the older generations.

49:15.361 --> 49:20.247
The curve, the age-related curve in church attendance, sadly the same for Catholics in the early 20s.

49:20.513 --> 49:23.377
as it is for Catholics who are in their middle forties.

49:23.397 --> 49:32.351
The people who are in their forties now will be going to church at the same rate when they're in their forties as their parents are and as their grandparents were.

49:32.371 --> 49:39.822
In other words, we have an interesting phenomenon of a group of people who have chosen to stay in the Catholic tradition, but on their own terms.

49:40.207 --> 49:57.473
And I think that phenomenon, which to me is the most striking thing since the end of the Second Vatican Council, simply is not recognized in those centers of culture like Midtown Manhattan and Hollywood and the other places where the images of our country are shaped.

49:58.533 --> 50:01.657
There's a number of different ways one can think of this wildly.

50:01.917 --> 50:16.954
How I think it happened, and the evidence tends to support this, is sometime in the late 60s, American Catholics, having begun to use the birth control pill because they were sure the Holy Spirit would support them in it, were faced with what looked like a choice between their marriage and their faith.

50:18.335 --> 50:20.278
And that was a terribly agonizing choice.

50:20.298 --> 50:25.063
And they went to their parish priest and said, is it true we have to make this choice?

50:25.718 --> 50:28.121
And the parish priest said a very unusual thing to him.

50:28.141 --> 50:29.002
He said, what do you think?

50:29.903 --> 50:39.754
He shifted the version of moral decision making back to that, because he didn't think they had to make that choice, either 85% of the parish priests didn't think that was an appropriate choice.

50:40.395 --> 50:48.925
And at that stage of the game, the Catholic way of me had to, as adults, re-evaluate their religious commitments.

50:49.613 --> 50:59.685
And four out of five of those who go to church every Sunday evaluated such that they now claim to be Catholics, continue to be Catholics, but on their own terms.

51:00.406 --> 51:06.573
Now, again, whether that's good or bad, you get the theologians and the leaders of the church to say, the sociologists that say that's what's happened.

51:07.134 --> 51:18.287
You had maybe a sort of a once-in-a-millennium phenomenon where people as adults seriously faced their religious heritage with a yes-no possibility.

51:18.655 --> 51:20.998
and thought their way through it and said yes.

51:22.340 --> 51:33.196
The result is a large group of lay Catholics who could now not be driven out of the church, no matter what happens in Rome, no matter what happens in the Chancery office.

51:33.236 --> 51:41.428
You know, your bishops criticized your involvement in politics in the old days because you got out of politics or you got out of the church.

51:41.448 --> 51:42.991
Now you don't do either.

51:43.011 --> 51:48.038
Because while you respect the bishops, you don't concede their right to tell you what to do.

51:48.693 --> 51:52.737
especially when they then go to Nicaragua to embrace a communist dictator.

51:53.718 --> 51:58.704
At least somebody knows that problem.

52:01.267 --> 52:09.055
There are two sort of dicta that I've heard recently that summarize the current position of American Catholics.

52:09.075 --> 52:18.345
What I think your typical Catholic is neither a Catholic reader, is neither somebody who has left, nor someone who is clinging by his fingertips.

52:18.713 --> 52:26.124
Your typical Catholic leader is like the Ryan family, and here's one of the books in Happier the Meek or in The Angels of September.

52:26.505 --> 52:44.011
The Ryan's a loud, zany, bushy crowd to whom leaving Catholicism is not even an option worth considering, and for whom the really important person is not the Pope, not the Cardinal, not the bishop, but the parish prince.

52:44.933 --> 52:47.657
For as one white bishop remarked to me recently,

52:47.907 --> 52:57.298
The big change in American Catholics since the Second Vatican Council is they have now made up their mind that it is the parish's church.

52:57.318 --> 53:01.744
And what goes on elsewhere, they don't care much about.

53:01.864 --> 53:05.929
And so it is the parish tree is like black and white and happy to be who matters.

53:06.930 --> 53:09.894
And the Pope, the Cardinals, they matter much less.

53:10.234 --> 53:14.279
Maybe it shouldn't be that way, but that's the way it is.

53:14.379 --> 53:16.902
We're incarcerating people in Rome these days.

53:17.202 --> 53:24.852
New York is getting a new auxiliary bishop who is to the right and kneel with the nine hostages.

53:24.872 --> 53:28.377
That's an Irish mythological hero.

53:28.958 --> 53:31.842
And it makes the fun day for New York Times.

53:31.862 --> 53:35.186
People couldn't care less than the Sunday morning Memorial Day weekend.

53:35.206 --> 53:38.811
What they care about is whether their parish preaches a good harmony.

53:39.412 --> 53:43.497
That's where the Catholic population, the Catholic leader is today.

53:44.017 --> 53:52.445
The second victim is from a young academic friend of mine who said, hey, this is my heritage.

53:52.666 --> 53:53.286
I'm a Catholic.

53:53.807 --> 53:55.368
And I'm not going to stop being a Catholic.

53:55.749 --> 54:02.656
And I'll be damned if a Polish cellophic in Rome is going to take my heritage away from me.

54:02.676 --> 54:04.277
Now, those are pretty tough words.

54:04.297 --> 54:13.146
And while I don't necessarily improve them, I think this combination of loyalty and defiance, defiant loyalty,

54:13.649 --> 54:19.097
is an excellent description of exactly where the Catholic reading audience is today.

54:19.457 --> 54:26.407
And it's just for that audience, the publisher should be publishing books and the bookseller should be selling books.

54:26.427 --> 54:27.969
Okay, how have I done with my comedy?

54:28.069 --> 54:30.192
Well, I've done right on 12 minutes.

54:30.212 --> 54:31.574
That's excellent.

54:31.594 --> 54:33.016
Now, the partner problem, that'll not be serious.

54:34.498 --> 54:38.704
Now, that was that, in the suburban Catholic parishes, it's the partner problem.

54:38.784 --> 54:40.667
Mother Nellis Mackenzie.

54:40.687 --> 54:41.648
You've got to stop the partner problem.

54:42.640 --> 54:49.107
Empty in a Catholic church on Sunday morning is like empty in a game to speak.

54:49.268 --> 55:03.083
Our first speaker is Jonathan Kozoff, whom I have to characterize, and he accepted the characterization for him, as a 60s activist in whom the fires are still burning.

55:03.704 --> 55:09.711
A perhaps relatively rare American, but still someone whom it's nice to read and nice to meet.

55:09.995 --> 55:16.384
Somebody whose enthusiasm has not passed with time, whose dedication and passion and commitment are still there.

55:16.985 --> 55:33.329
If you read his National Book Award-winning book published in 68, by the way, I have a National Book Award for Philosophy.

55:33.350 --> 55:34.812
Don't be envious, Father.

55:37.456 --> 55:38.197
I'm Jewish.

55:38.437 --> 55:39.799
I can't go to heaven.

55:49.482 --> 55:55.731
I had this dreadful love.

55:56.612 --> 55:59.516
I had thin quality in me.

55:59.617 --> 56:06.346
I'm always polite and mind my words until I was a priest.

56:07.348 --> 56:07.708
I always perished.

56:08.169 --> 56:11.814
It happened recently in a Catholic church and the priest was kind.

56:11.934 --> 56:17.903
He jumped up immediately and laughed and said, Jonathan, it doesn't matter.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.672
You're Jewish.

56:21.353 --> 56:22.394
I've never had it anyway.

56:22.634 --> 56:26.279
But I wouldn't go to town because I never knew what the truth was.

56:27.120 --> 56:28.482
I go to Spurgatory.

56:29.483 --> 56:45.464
Spurgatory, I think it's something like sitting in the waiting room at the United Airlines room.

56:46.025 --> 56:48.548
One hundred issues

56:49.861 --> 56:52.946
come and go within a large convention of this kind.

56:55.570 --> 57:07.149
If on the day you leave, there is just one that burns within your soul, let it be this of which I speak today.

57:09.733 --> 57:17.505
When I rose to Literate America, I was asked to visit as a senior editor at one of New York's largest publishers.

57:20.033 --> 57:38.780
He sat me down within his office, looked me in the eyes, and told me in a calm and condescending voice the terms on which he would accept this book for publication.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.483
A lot of editors are scared.

57:40.543 --> 57:45.250
Don't worry, I won't name it.

57:45.270 --> 57:46.952
A book on ethics.

57:47.641 --> 57:53.767
will not sell in 1985, he cleverly announced.

57:55.789 --> 58:08.181
If you could give it somehow a more hard-nosed focus, something like the billion dollar error, I would like to do it.

58:09.322 --> 58:09.983
Let me know.

58:12.966 --> 58:14.087
I never let him know.

58:15.890 --> 58:17.652
I did not like the way he spoke.

58:18.954 --> 58:26.582
Guided by Lynn Nesbitt, the most ethical of literary agents, I took the book instead to Doubleday.

58:27.583 --> 58:42.100
Backed by the conviction and the courage of this publisher and by an unexpected surge of urgency within the literary population, we have proven that that narrow and myopic gentleman was wrong.

58:45.050 --> 58:46.652
60 million U.S.

58:46.892 --> 59:01.190
adults, one-third of our adult population, cannot read a daily paper, a book, a welfare form.

59:03.192 --> 59:13.605
The antidote instructions on a can of kitchen cleanser, the word of God within the Bible, or the word of man,

59:14.277 --> 59:18.203
within the verse of Milton on the tales of Tolstoy by the U.S.

59:18.263 --> 59:20.987
Constitution.

59:21.007 --> 59:34.828
49 out of 158 members of the UN in our literacy levels, we are also 24th in books produced per capita.

59:34.848 --> 59:37.652
The Soviet Union ranks 5th from the top.

59:41.918 --> 59:43.040
45% of U.S.

59:43.060 --> 59:45.503
adults do not read newspapers.

59:46.104 --> 59:48.167
Only 10% abstain by choice.

59:48.708 --> 59:51.271
The rest can't understand.

59:51.291 --> 59:57.320
4 in 10 Bostonians can't read the Boston Globe.

59:57.340 --> 01:00:09.096
4 in 10 New Yorkers cannot read the news the New York Times sees hit to print.

01:00:09.116 --> 01:00:10.238
40%

01:00:10.572 --> 01:00:16.280
of recent military crews read between the fourth and eighth grade levels.

01:00:17.802 --> 01:00:24.532
Forty percent, the army has been forced to issue comic books to serve as manuals of instruction.

01:00:26.014 --> 01:00:34.486
A five-page comic book is needed to explain how to release the hood of a jeep.

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:38.352
You may wonder how long are the comic books to tell a soldier

01:00:40.694 --> 01:00:51.128
60% of prison inmates and 85% of juveniles who come before the court are unable to read.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:57.156
47% of young black adults are illiterate.

01:00:57.877 --> 01:01:01.502
That figure will rise to 50% within the next four years.

01:01:03.224 --> 01:01:05.267
22% of adults

01:01:12.723 --> 01:01:16.367
can't address an envelope to reach its destination.

01:01:17.729 --> 01:01:22.815
One million teenage kids read at third grade level.

01:01:23.936 --> 01:01:38.174
In the state of Utah, where the population is almost entirely white and native-born, 200,100 adults can't read a daily paper.

01:01:41.177 --> 01:01:42.679
The annual cost in dollars

01:01:43.165 --> 01:01:46.429
is above $120 billion.

01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:55.642
$14 billion alone for prison costs and welfare maintenance directly tied to the unemployability of illiterate adults.

01:01:56.863 --> 01:02:00.188
Over $100 billion more in lowered GNP.

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:06.797
That's the bottom line, as they say in Washington.

01:02:08.399 --> 01:02:11.603
But there is another loss which is not reflected in the GNP,

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.405
It is the insult to democracy.

01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:32.635
It is the compromise of all that is suggested by our wistful reference to a Jeffersonian idea that rests upon the full informed participation of the people.

01:02:32.655 --> 01:02:35.059
Whether a nation so divided
