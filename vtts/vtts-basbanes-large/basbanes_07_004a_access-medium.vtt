WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:10.813
Just one, two, three, four, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.555
I'm talking with Dr. John Warnock.

00:12.915 --> 00:19.641
I guess, you know, let's start, if we might, with the inspiration from Octavo, which I understand came from your own collection.

00:20.842 --> 00:24.545
Maybe if we could just kind of start and enter a conversation.

00:24.605 --> 00:25.025
OK.

00:25.266 --> 00:27.928
I think it was 1987.

00:30.050 --> 00:33.733
We were going through the Grosvenor House Antique Fair in London.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.777
I think it was June of 1987.

00:36.878 --> 00:41.645
And my son came up and said, Dad, you've got to look at this.

00:41.685 --> 00:44.569
We were at Mag's stall.

00:44.910 --> 00:53.363
And he said, this is Euclid's first English edition of Euclid.

00:53.403 --> 00:57.990
And it was 1570, a John Day's copy, and it has all the marvelous pop-ups in it.

00:58.271 --> 01:01.155
And so I said...

01:01.912 --> 01:05.236
I looked through this book, and I said, this is a totally amazing book.

01:05.316 --> 01:06.357
It's a beautiful book.

01:06.397 --> 01:08.379
I don't know where you've ever seen a copy of this yet.

01:09.220 --> 01:11.103
And I said, I have to have this.

01:11.123 --> 01:12.204
So I looked at the price tag.

01:12.224 --> 01:13.385
I said, well, we went public.

01:13.425 --> 01:14.346
I poured this.

01:15.588 --> 01:15.908
You went public.

01:15.928 --> 01:18.091
What he read is he just seemed to have just taken Adobe public.

01:18.171 --> 01:20.173
That's right, yes.

01:20.333 --> 01:20.994
So I bought it.

01:21.174 --> 01:27.261
And you bring this book home, and you're gentle man this book is so appropriate because

01:27.595 --> 01:30.918
You put it up on the shelf, and it's the only book of its kind up there.

01:32.340 --> 01:32.540
Hi, folks.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.181
Hi.

01:34.202 --> 01:35.663
Would you like something to drink?

01:35.683 --> 01:37.165
Are you going to have just sparkling water?

01:38.026 --> 01:38.446
Is that a grano okay?

01:38.466 --> 01:42.210
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.211
That sounds good.

01:43.411 --> 01:43.571
Three?

01:43.611 --> 01:45.113
Yeah, thanks.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.436
So you put it up on the shelf, and it's the only book like that.

01:48.496 --> 01:50.598
And you say, well, it clearly needs friends.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.042
That's a very slippery slope.

01:55.163 --> 01:56.404
So I start it.

01:56.772 --> 02:02.057
And then I started... I was totally a neophyte.

02:02.077 --> 02:04.479
Then I started learning about... So you're anticipating my questions.

02:04.539 --> 02:04.840
Yeah.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.542
Did you ask if you were a bibliophile prior to this?

02:07.642 --> 02:08.203
Not really.

02:09.584 --> 02:11.486
I was sort of a neophyte.

02:12.367 --> 02:13.488
What was it about you, Clint?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.430
Well, I was a mathematician.

02:16.350 --> 02:21.796
So I studied my undergraduate degrees, my bachelor's and master's in mathematics.

02:22.396 --> 02:24.618
And I really liked geometry.

02:25.599 --> 02:26.560
And so...

02:27.097 --> 02:34.726
Euclid, the old book, being in the printing business through Adobe, having an appreciation for type and early books.

02:35.147 --> 02:37.370
What was there about handling that book?

02:37.450 --> 02:41.134
Was there something, the tactility of it that went beyond the content?

02:41.455 --> 02:43.717
Oh, the fact... It is relevant to Octavo.

02:43.737 --> 02:55.652
Yes, I think that I hadn't realized that all the early books were really in wonderful shape and would never deteriorate because they had all rag-based papers and...

02:55.987 --> 03:06.483
I just hadn't really appreciated the diversity of topography that they had used, or all of the printing devices, or the cache words, or all of this stuff.

03:06.503 --> 03:14.675
And here you're just holding an artifact of history that just really must have had an impact at the time that it was printed.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.676
Was it a palpable?

03:15.696 --> 03:16.858
Oh, absolutely.

03:16.878 --> 03:17.439
Physical?

03:17.459 --> 03:18.681
Oh, yes, absolutely.

03:18.701 --> 03:20.724
Do you think they'd engage all the senses?

03:20.744 --> 03:21.465
Oh, I think so.

03:21.805 --> 03:23.007
I think so.

03:23.358 --> 03:26.782
It has a very definite feel about it, a very definite weight about it.

03:27.503 --> 03:30.427
I mean, there's a wonderful smell to it.

03:30.447 --> 03:32.410
It's gorgeous.

03:32.530 --> 03:38.678
It does engage all these sexes in it.

03:39.399 --> 03:40.000
It does.

03:40.701 --> 03:41.181
It does.

03:41.802 --> 03:44.105
I bought a bunch of stuff that I shouldn't have bought.

03:44.726 --> 03:46.328
Like what?

03:46.348 --> 03:47.449
Might I ask, like what?

03:47.590 --> 03:50.293
Oh, a bad copy of Darwin.

03:50.982 --> 03:55.607
that I eventually got rid of, and I bought some books that were relevant.

03:56.507 --> 04:02.573
Then I was introduced to Quaritch, and to... Arthur Freeman?

04:02.593 --> 04:08.059
Yeah, and Jonathan Hill, and Rick Watson.

04:08.479 --> 04:09.040
You edited it.

04:09.901 --> 04:10.121
Yes.

04:11.022 --> 04:16.467
I got to know all of the dealers, Stephen Lowenthal, and they...

04:17.206 --> 04:23.193
So I, gosh, here is a guy who's clearly interested in this, wants to go hunting.

04:24.194 --> 04:28.319
Also, I got introduced early to a copy of Printing in the Mind of Man.

04:29.420 --> 04:32.183
And that one will, that one traps you.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.646
Well, it seems to define your collection.

04:34.806 --> 04:35.066
Yes.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.149
Well, it's... The scope of it.

04:37.169 --> 04:41.133
Yes, it's actually diversified a great deal off of that since.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.937
But that's clearly how it started.

04:43.957 --> 04:44.637
Great ideas.

04:44.778 --> 04:44.978
Yes.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.099
Books that... Yes.

04:46.467 --> 04:51.273
Well, as an undergraduate, I majored in mathematics and philosophy.

04:51.393 --> 04:52.815
I had a double major.

04:52.835 --> 05:01.005
So I read Kant and Hume and Descartes and Leibniz and all of those.

05:01.025 --> 05:02.146
So you had a liberal education.

05:02.246 --> 05:03.348
I got a liberal education.

05:03.368 --> 05:04.049
Important, isn't it?

05:04.069 --> 05:04.329
Yes.

05:05.631 --> 05:08.734
For a man who became... That's right.

05:09.055 --> 05:12.559
And also founding Adobe and...

05:13.096 --> 05:18.905
having an impact on a printing industry that had 500 years of history associated with it.

05:19.085 --> 05:27.457
I had learned a lot about typography and a lot about the traditions of type and the invention of the various technological advances in printing.

05:27.477 --> 05:33.867
And so these two interests sort of came together and the books became important.

05:33.887 --> 05:37.292
Approximately how many volumes would you say you have?

05:37.492 --> 05:39.475
Not very many, but they're good.

05:39.877 --> 05:41.479
About a hundred, I would guess.

05:42.440 --> 05:42.640
Yes.

05:43.021 --> 05:44.483
A hundred choice books.

05:44.503 --> 05:46.485
Always a hundred choice works.

05:46.505 --> 05:49.769
Probably 60 out of printing, I would guess.

05:49.789 --> 05:50.690
60 or 70.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.112
So that's probably your goal?

05:52.392 --> 05:53.914
Is it your goal to try and get them?

05:54.194 --> 05:54.395
No.

05:54.795 --> 05:55.916
No, I gave up that.

05:56.317 --> 05:58.379
That would be an okay goal.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.223
My goal is actually to buy the books I like.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.387
And that's diversified.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.428
So...

06:05.881 --> 06:14.036
If something strikes my fancy or I see something and say, God, I really would like to have that book, then I'd buy it.

06:14.116 --> 06:16.160
I'm sorry, what year did you say this began?

06:16.180 --> 06:16.681
87.

06:16.701 --> 06:17.222
87.

06:17.402 --> 06:21.529
So that was 14 years ago, you were 56 or something like that?

06:21.610 --> 06:22.832
No, I'm 60.

06:22.852 --> 06:26.198
But I mean, at the time you started, you were in the 40s.

06:26.398 --> 06:27.140
Yeah, that was me.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.003
That's a good age to get there.

06:29.185 --> 06:34.451
Let's see, that was 13 years ago.

06:34.471 --> 06:36.012
He was about 20.

06:36.293 --> 06:37.634
And his name, I'm sorry?

06:37.654 --> 06:38.135
Christopher.

06:39.276 --> 06:41.879
And he's with Adobe, I think.

06:41.899 --> 06:43.260
No, my one son is with Adobe.

06:43.300 --> 06:47.665
He actually started a company called Ebrary that's trying to revolutionize libraries.

06:48.165 --> 06:48.446
Really?

06:48.566 --> 06:48.786
Yes.

06:49.407 --> 06:50.688
Is this something I should know about?

06:50.908 --> 06:51.709
Yes, I think so.

06:51.749 --> 06:53.251
Revolutionize libraries?

06:53.411 --> 06:57.235
Well, he's gone to most of the major publishers and said, gee,

06:57.738 --> 07:02.466
deliver me content from PDF, and I will... Here's the goal.

07:02.586 --> 07:12.101
The goal is to be able to go to a place like Amazon, be able to browse the books like you're in a bookstore, and then buy them if you want them, but browse them for free.

07:13.003 --> 07:22.598
And so he provides the infrastructure for doing full-text searches across all of the textbooks and being able to highlight where you find it.

07:23.253 --> 07:26.138
entries, being able to cut and paste text out of it.

07:26.158 --> 07:26.559
That's fantastic.

07:26.579 --> 07:29.003
If they have a website or something, I can search.

07:29.143 --> 07:30.926
It'll go live probably in about a month.

07:32.128 --> 07:33.090
Tell me just the name of it.

07:33.210 --> 07:37.978
Ebrary.com.

07:38.479 --> 07:39.501
How do you relate to the books?

07:39.521 --> 07:40.503
Do you read them?

07:40.523 --> 07:40.903
Yes.

07:43.267 --> 07:44.890
Well, actually what I do...

07:45.157 --> 07:59.599
is I look at the books very carefully, and then usually I'll go out and buy a translation if it's in a foreign language, but if it's the real book, I'll try to find a cheaper way to, like optics, you read out of a paperback.

08:00.501 --> 08:08.473
And so, if you can kind of describe the leap from the collection to Octavio.

08:09.314 --> 08:12.379
The thing that really struck me when I started collecting

08:13.793 --> 08:19.984
is before I became a collector, I really didn't even know that these books existed.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.590
I mean, you knew that they existed.

08:23.610 --> 08:26.615
They existed as artifacts available to a person such as yourself.

08:26.655 --> 08:27.076
That's right.

08:27.897 --> 08:38.535
And the other thing is, well, you didn't know what kind of places they were stored in, what they looked like, because the general public has no access.

08:39.865 --> 08:44.750
I mean, if you go to the British Library, you have to say, oh, I'm a researcher in Shakespeare.

08:44.931 --> 08:47.313
I have a specific need to see this.

08:47.333 --> 08:50.817
You have to demonstrate your need to see something.

08:51.438 --> 08:51.898
That's right.

08:52.099 --> 08:52.679
That's right.

08:53.080 --> 09:03.231
And I said, well, this is a shame, because the libraries obviously have the charter to protect these things and keep them from being damaged.

09:04.232 --> 09:09.518
But you would think that they would also want to get them more publicly available.

09:10.223 --> 09:24.821
So in the process of sort of inventing Acrobat as part of Adobe, I said, gee, the technology is coming to a point where it really is feasible to capture these books and make them available on a much broader basis.

09:25.742 --> 09:27.103
And so we started Octavo.

09:27.644 --> 09:36.855
But the other thing that happened, the key point was that, let's see, what was the point I was going to make?

09:38.253 --> 09:42.137
The technology was coming along where you could actually make it happen.

09:44.359 --> 09:48.042
And you could satisfy both parties.

09:48.102 --> 09:54.508
You could preserve the real artifact by photographing it once, but make it available on a CD electronically.

09:54.748 --> 09:57.891
And I think we should point out, you say the technology was coming along.

09:57.911 --> 09:59.472
You were developing technology.

09:59.492 --> 09:59.773
That's right.

09:59.793 --> 10:01.214
This technology that he's writing.

10:01.574 --> 10:02.015
That's right.

10:03.516 --> 10:08.040
I mean, this adds an element to collecting that is unprecedented for me.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.625
It starts with your books.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.027
These belong to you.

10:12.948 --> 10:18.915
I believe that the first issues in Octavo come from your collection, right?

10:18.935 --> 10:21.959
How many titles from your library became Octavo?

10:22.640 --> 10:24.823
Well, all of them eventually will.

10:24.843 --> 10:27.566
I mean, you're doing other things with Congress.

10:28.067 --> 10:29.809
Well, and I said, gee, if

10:30.262 --> 10:38.429
We started with my collection because it was available, but then we said, gee, there are some things I don't have, like a first folio or a Gutenberg Bible or things like that.

10:39.470 --> 10:46.096
Let's go start talking to the libraries and see if we can... Well, you know, there will be a first folio for sale this fall.

10:46.936 --> 10:52.401
I mean, Abel Berlain's books have been announced, and we're going... He's in my new book, in fact.

10:52.481 --> 10:53.442
So he's putting one up?

10:54.023 --> 11:00.268
He's an elderly gentleman, and he's been sick, and he has probably the finest first folio

11:00.772 --> 11:02.535
in private hands.

11:02.716 --> 11:06.523
I mean, it's in its original binding, there were no pages missing, it's a perfect copy.

11:06.904 --> 11:16.823
He also has a second folio, a third folio, and a fourth folio, and his third folio, oh, by the way, the first folio bears the prior ownership signature of John Dryden,

11:17.377 --> 11:22.324
And the third folio... That's not going to go for much money.

11:22.344 --> 11:24.547
No, it'll go way more than that.

11:24.627 --> 11:31.456
I think so, because there are only six first folios, I believe, left in private hands.

11:31.676 --> 11:34.801
And it's by far... Well, and the foil copy was really bad.

11:34.921 --> 11:37.364
And the foil copy was bad.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.348
But the third folio is also totally documented.

11:40.368 --> 11:44.734
I mean, the Fovenons were John Fleming's books, which Abel brought from John Fleming.

11:45.372 --> 11:53.401
And his third folio was the volume that Samuel Johnson used when he was preparing his edition of Shakespeare.

11:56.084 --> 12:00.989
I mean, so do things like provenance and association matter to you?

12:01.009 --> 12:02.591
I guess there is a bit.

12:02.631 --> 12:07.737
Well, all my copies of Darwin's belong to his cousin.

12:07.757 --> 12:07.977
Yes.

12:08.378 --> 12:12.342
So they're William Fox Darwin's copies, and they're all inscribed.

12:12.693 --> 12:14.677
And Darwin really didn't inscribe it?

12:14.697 --> 12:20.891
No, this was his secretary, the inscription, but they're still called presentation copies because his secretary did it.

12:20.911 --> 12:22.133
They're still called presentations.

12:22.193 --> 12:24.719
Well, that's extraordinary because he does very few of these.

12:24.739 --> 12:25.581
That's right.

12:25.621 --> 12:31.714
And actually, any Darwinist, Haskell Norman, he had...

12:31.880 --> 12:33.486
Well, I bought the whole collection.

12:33.526 --> 12:35.112
So you bought Haskell stuff?

12:35.213 --> 12:35.433
Yes.

12:35.454 --> 12:35.755
Haskell stuff?

12:35.996 --> 12:36.879
No, I bought, no.

12:36.959 --> 12:41.456
This was offered before, and these were all, these are all association copies.

12:41.476 --> 12:43.223
They all belong to Darwin's cousin.

12:43.945 --> 12:45.186
Yeah.

12:45.206 --> 12:46.748
Did you know Haskell Norman, by the way?

12:46.768 --> 12:47.449
San Francisco?

12:47.469 --> 12:48.430
No, I know his son.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.592
And Jeremy, of course, is his son.

12:50.612 --> 12:56.038
I would have thought that science and... Well, book collectors don't get to know each other very much, do they?

12:56.058 --> 12:58.401
These days... More so, probably.

12:58.501 --> 12:59.562
No, I think less so.

12:59.582 --> 13:04.267
I think I'm particularly aware of him.

13:04.287 --> 13:05.809
The Internet has changed things.

13:05.829 --> 13:07.711
And you don't buy over the net, do you?

13:08.132 --> 13:10.975
I mean, you don't have to see the book and handle the book?

13:10.995 --> 13:12.016
Oh, yeah, sure.

13:12.236 --> 13:13.918
I never... Well, I would never buy blind.

13:14.472 --> 13:15.493
I've always got to see it.

13:15.633 --> 13:16.434
Do you have a want list?

13:16.514 --> 13:17.576
I mean, is this... Oh, sure.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.098
It's a big Kepler book.

13:20.118 --> 13:22.141
It's on my want list because I don't have it.

13:22.541 --> 13:23.322
Do you have a Vesalius?

13:23.883 --> 13:24.844
I do have a Vesalius.

13:24.864 --> 13:25.064
You do?

13:25.404 --> 13:26.125
Oh, yeah.

13:26.145 --> 13:30.891
Oh, I've got... Oh, I've got some really nice books.

13:31.351 --> 13:32.673
I have a Sigerius Nuncis.

13:33.153 --> 13:33.273
Wow.

13:33.934 --> 13:37.438
I have a Harvey's Mortis Cordae.

13:37.899 --> 13:39.120
That's fantastic.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.083
I have the really rare ones.

13:42.163 --> 13:43.585
I have the...

13:45.202 --> 13:51.569
the wonderful and great book of The Voyage of the Beagle that has all of the animal engravings in it, which is also really rare.

13:51.589 --> 13:58.937
I have the first printing of the Bill of Rights, but I have the only private copy.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.341
Look at the smiles.

14:02.361 --> 14:05.124
The tape doesn't reflect the smile, unfortunately.

14:06.465 --> 14:07.126
This is a collection.

14:07.467 --> 14:10.810
I hope at some point you can show us some of these books.

14:10.830 --> 14:11.151
Oh, sure.

14:11.491 --> 14:11.851
I'm sure.

14:12.612 --> 14:15.175
Well, that was the other thing I was going to say.

14:15.762 --> 14:17.605
I started giving these talks.

14:17.625 --> 14:33.012
I was chairman of the Technology Museum in San Jose, and they were having a party for the donors who were giving money to the Technology Museum, and they said, John, would you give a book about your collection?

14:34.038 --> 14:35.840
There were actually two presentations I gave.

14:35.960 --> 14:47.555
One was to a TED conference, and I said, you know, if I just go talk about the books, it's not going to be right, because in order to appreciate these books, you sort of have to see them and touch them and feel them.

14:48.376 --> 14:58.269
And so I took about a half a dozen books down to this conference in Monterey, patted them up, loaded them into a tub, put them in the back of the car.

14:58.289 --> 15:01.032
You've got more cars in the back.

15:01.052 --> 15:02.374
And I said, and...

15:02.962 --> 15:05.385
And I took the Bill of Rights, too.

15:05.665 --> 15:16.376
And the speaker before me, you have to get the context to get this right, but the speaker before me was the young man who stood up in front of the tank at Tiananmen Square.

15:16.476 --> 15:17.077
Oh, really?

15:18.078 --> 15:19.820
And faced down the tank.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.441
How do you follow that act?

15:21.462 --> 15:30.471
Well, he talked about his father, who was an academic and who had been in prison in China, and how important intellectual... I'm going to get all teary.

15:30.772 --> 15:33.314
because this was just incredibly emotional.

15:33.915 --> 15:37.358
And he talked about the importance of freedom.

15:37.918 --> 15:40.300
And then I got up and I said, well, here's the Bill of Rights.

15:43.523 --> 15:46.566
That's a great book story.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.408
There wasn't a dry eye in the place.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.811
And how did he respond to that?

15:53.092 --> 15:53.812
Oh, he just did.

15:54.593 --> 15:57.636
I mean, he was just overwhelmed.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.458
And of course,

16:00.944 --> 16:10.116
Does the original artifact have, and in fact, this came up with the LC conference, the iconic texture, the iconic value of an original artifact.

16:10.456 --> 16:12.318
The Bill of Rights is available on the internet.

16:12.398 --> 16:12.639
Oh, sure.

16:12.659 --> 16:15.262
Anybody can go download a text of it.

16:15.322 --> 16:19.547
Anybody can go down and download a text of the Declaration of Independence.

16:19.567 --> 16:20.429
Not the same.

16:20.609 --> 16:23.893
Spend five or six million dollars for a copy.

16:24.073 --> 16:29.500
So what is there about the artifact, I think, that elevates it above the text?

16:29.733 --> 16:35.521
Because it is relevant to what's going on in the world, I think.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.042
I don't know.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.186
The artifacts transport you back in history.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.031
The text doesn't do that.

16:42.351 --> 16:43.292
The artifact does.

16:43.573 --> 16:49.681
I mean, it has this property that you're seeing it the same way that Darwin saw it or Newton saw it or Haley saw it.

16:49.722 --> 16:52.425
And you see Haley's engraving in Principia.

16:53.407 --> 16:54.168
Do you have a Principia?

16:54.188 --> 16:54.609
Oh, sure.

16:56.551 --> 16:57.873
Don't tell me you've got a Copernicus.

16:58.134 --> 16:58.474
Yes.

16:59.095 --> 17:00.878
Who said that he never got a Copernicus?

17:01.539 --> 17:03.341
Haskell Norman never got a Copernicus.

17:03.802 --> 17:04.323
He got one.

17:05.024 --> 17:09.751
He bought one from Howell, here in San Francisco, and it turned out to be the one that had been stolen.

17:10.011 --> 17:10.592
Yes, right.

17:10.692 --> 17:11.514
And he had to return it.

17:11.974 --> 17:17.222
So, remember he said, I hope to get the great Copernicus, and he never did.

17:17.658 --> 17:19.761
And so you've got a Copernicus.

17:19.841 --> 17:20.703
I have a Copernicus.

17:20.723 --> 17:23.687
Yours isn't the garden one, is it?

17:23.707 --> 17:23.767
No.

17:23.907 --> 17:29.616
Mine is actually, I talked, Owen Gingrich came out to see the Copernicus.

17:29.676 --> 17:31.879
And he said, mine's the largest copy he's ever seen.

17:32.300 --> 17:32.781
Really?

17:32.861 --> 17:34.363
It has the original staining.

17:34.383 --> 17:35.525
It's never been trimmed.

17:35.725 --> 17:40.212
It also has no annotations in the margins, which really disappointed him.

17:40.232 --> 17:41.874
Well, that's what he's trying to determine.

17:42.295 --> 17:42.535
Yeah.

17:42.515 --> 17:45.119
He was moved by the greatest book never read.

17:45.259 --> 17:45.519
Yes.

17:45.579 --> 17:49.064
He was trying to determine that it was read, of course, by the annotations.

17:49.465 --> 17:50.827
So yours has no annotations?

17:50.907 --> 17:51.087
No.

17:52.349 --> 17:53.551
Without any trim margins?

17:53.911 --> 17:54.652
No trim margins.

17:54.672 --> 17:57.797
Well, and it has this end stamping on it of the original owner.

17:57.857 --> 18:00.741
It actually came out of Poland, I think.

18:00.761 --> 18:01.082
Wow.

18:01.222 --> 18:02.323
And you got that from a bookseller?

18:02.484 --> 18:02.704
Yeah.

18:03.225 --> 18:04.707
Do you buy at auction?

18:04.807 --> 18:05.448
Sometimes, yes.

18:06.289 --> 18:09.113
Are you familiar with Bill Gates's collection?

18:09.329 --> 18:11.974
I know a couple of things that he's got.

18:12.334 --> 18:14.518
I don't know the extent of it.

18:15.801 --> 18:19.207
You were collecting five or six years ago.

18:19.447 --> 18:21.812
Were you tempted, say, by the Codex Leicester?

18:23.294 --> 18:23.555
No.

18:23.896 --> 18:26.701
Because of Adobe, I'm mostly into printed works.

18:26.761 --> 18:27.883
I'm not into manuscripts.

18:27.923 --> 18:31.810
I have a couple of manuscripts, but I don't collect manuscripts.

18:32.161 --> 18:34.744
Octavo really goes after manuscripts, however.

18:35.344 --> 18:36.105
It does.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.727
It's now going after you.

18:37.827 --> 18:43.733
That would seem to be a really natural thing for Octavo, because the manuscript, by definition, is unique.

18:44.014 --> 18:48.018
Well, the Library of Congress is making available the Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts.

18:50.961 --> 18:54.925
How could you not get excited over the Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts?

18:54.965 --> 18:56.647
Fantastic.

18:56.667 --> 19:01.172
And I guess to go back to what you were saying about

19:02.671 --> 19:06.375
the artifact, and all of it's what they call the paratextual elements.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.937
And it's not just the text.

19:08.137 --> 19:09.358
No, it's not the text.

19:09.378 --> 19:09.959
It's the type.

19:09.979 --> 19:10.840
It's the layout.

19:10.860 --> 19:11.360
It's the design.

19:11.801 --> 19:15.124
It's the feel of the vellum if it's vellum.

19:15.164 --> 19:20.590
How do you try and share that with the readers of Octavio?

19:20.610 --> 19:21.812
Is that possible?

19:21.832 --> 19:24.354
Well, the layout and the text clearly is.

19:24.435 --> 19:30.341
I mean, you get as close to visually to the book as possible.

19:30.661 --> 19:32.323
But you don't get the tactile.

19:32.894 --> 19:36.680
or you don't get the sort of the feel of the binding or the smell.

19:37.882 --> 19:40.546
But I don't know how you do that anyway.

19:40.566 --> 19:43.291
Well, digitally, that could be possible at some point.

19:43.311 --> 19:45.474
Well, maybe sometime in the future.

19:45.795 --> 19:47.778
That's not something you're working on, to be sure.

19:47.978 --> 19:52.686
No, mostly just getting the visual aspects of the binding and everything.

19:52.706 --> 19:56.472
Of course, with books like these, how do you photograph them without...

19:56.755 --> 19:58.917
Obviously, you know guillotine books.

19:59.137 --> 19:59.718
No, we don't.

19:59.798 --> 20:00.178
No, no.

20:00.578 --> 20:01.719
They're all opened.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.281
They're all opened.

20:03.581 --> 20:05.403
Just as though you... Yeah, sure.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.904
No, it just opens it.

20:06.964 --> 20:08.585
You photograph it as though you're reading it.

20:10.067 --> 20:17.093
So, but are the waves in the octavo editions, or have you been able to... They're fairly... No, they're fairly... They're there.

20:17.533 --> 20:20.076
It's as though you're looking at the book in your lap.

20:21.917 --> 20:22.498
Just simple.

20:22.578 --> 20:26.121
And the lighting is very special to show the texture of the paper and...

20:26.320 --> 20:32.509
and the imprint of the text and the type, and you could fill the screen with a single letter.

20:33.190 --> 20:37.156
Yeah.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.698
Now, you invented a language.

20:38.859 --> 20:43.145
I mean, you actually did you bring this technology to bear?

20:43.465 --> 20:44.106
Oh, absolutely.

20:44.387 --> 20:51.998
And I wonder if, you know, we're ready for the general reader, but could you tell me what challenges were involved?

20:52.018 --> 20:55.483
Well, Adobe played a very

20:55.784 --> 21:00.971
has played a very special role in sort of the history of printing.

21:02.994 --> 21:13.468
We brought out a technology in 1983, and over the past 18 years, it has completely changed printing.

21:13.488 --> 21:20.037
I mean, really completely changed printing, not just a little bit, but across the boards, newspapers, magazines, textbooks,

21:20.506 --> 21:22.188
All advertising, publishing.

21:22.388 --> 21:23.810
Using your technology.

21:23.930 --> 21:28.516
It became a standard and a very ubiquitous standard.

21:28.556 --> 21:34.163
And so almost everything that you see visually that is printed uses our technology.

21:34.904 --> 21:41.772
Whether they're package labels on grocery store shelves or the covers on Frito-Lay or the printing on a Coke can.

21:42.376 --> 21:44.318
They all use our technology.

21:44.338 --> 21:45.359
What was the perception?

21:45.379 --> 21:49.484
What did you see that the people at Xerox didn't see?

21:50.144 --> 21:59.875
We figured out how to bring all of the graphic elements and the type elements and the image elements together on a common open platform.

21:59.995 --> 22:07.063
And that essentially, all the systems prior to that were proprietary, special purpose kinds of things.

22:07.143 --> 22:11.067
And we sort of flattened the playing field and made it open.

22:11.452 --> 22:14.438
It just changed publishing.

22:14.458 --> 22:14.618
Amazing.

22:14.638 --> 22:24.316
So that technology and sort of the understanding of the history of the graphic arts and then these books is becoming part of the book.

22:24.336 --> 22:27.603
But central to this is to replicate the original.

22:27.623 --> 22:27.823
Yes.

22:27.843 --> 22:28.244
Isn't that right?

22:28.264 --> 22:29.266
Oh, absolutely.

22:29.386 --> 22:31.570
And why is that important?

22:32.258 --> 22:32.879
Why isn't it?

22:33.139 --> 22:40.047
Every high school kid in the world should be able to see what Ben Franklin's book on electricity is like and read it.

22:41.289 --> 22:45.053
Because when Ben Franklin was inventing.

22:45.073 --> 22:50.399
I mean, these are his letters to Collingwood, and he's inventing, and the kite experiment is in there.

22:50.579 --> 22:57.928
And the way it's sort of mangled by history physics teachers doesn't show the invention process.

22:58.280 --> 23:07.013
I mean, if you read Galileo, the English translations of Galileo, it's very different than the way Galileo is presented in a physics class.

23:08.314 --> 23:14.243
Because you're seeing Galileo figure it out.

23:17.087 --> 23:21.874
I guess, you know, I'm trying to work in this whole... It's almost becoming a...

23:22.597 --> 23:31.408
cliched, hackneyed discussion, but nevertheless, the certain, as some people purport, certain obsolescence of the printed book.

23:31.969 --> 23:37.796
I wonder how you weigh in on that as a pioneer, as a member of the computer.

23:38.036 --> 23:40.740
It will be, you know, eventually it may happen.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.082
It certainly won't happen in my lifetime.

23:46.246 --> 23:49.971
People have asked me when electronic books are going to take over, and I think

23:50.727 --> 23:54.137
It will be when kids learn how to read off of the screen.

23:54.158 --> 24:01.480
In other words, when their primal learning process about information doesn't come from a book, but comes from the screen.

24:02.135 --> 24:09.444
and they actually learn to read off a screen, then that will sort of wire off all their cells to prefer that mode.

24:10.124 --> 24:11.246
And that will be a long time.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.849
But you don't think that that's even happening in many instances?

24:13.889 --> 24:14.670
No, not yet.

24:14.690 --> 24:16.071
Well, it's starting to happen.

24:16.332 --> 24:22.839
It's happening with music and Napster, and how music gets delivered is changing very rapidly.

24:23.280 --> 24:30.488
Do you think that computer technology will, in a way, liberate the book and allow the printed book to achieve its...

24:30.468 --> 24:38.437
Well, it'll certainly allow you to go back in history and see a lot of things that you would normally not have access to.

24:38.497 --> 24:45.285
I mean, the internet right now, I mean, just bookfinder.com allows you access to buying books that you could never find.

24:45.305 --> 24:45.886
That you could never find.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.407
I use it all the time.

24:47.427 --> 24:48.429
I use it all the time, too.

24:48.449 --> 24:51.112
Not necessarily for rarities or antidote, but just books I need.

24:51.152 --> 24:52.353
Just books you need, right.

24:52.373 --> 24:56.678
And I want and would never... I mean, I went up the other night and...

24:57.215 --> 25:00.693
We were looking for a videotape of an old movie.

25:01.296 --> 25:05.537
The videotape is out of print, but there were some used copies up there.

25:05.973 --> 25:06.914
went up and bought it.

25:06.934 --> 25:17.443
You know, you remember when photography, and you're a photographer, I understand, when photography was invented in 1839 with the fear and the anxiety of the great portrait painters?

25:17.463 --> 25:17.743
Yes.

25:18.123 --> 25:19.945
We're dead.

25:19.965 --> 25:21.426
This is the end of art as we know it.

25:21.446 --> 25:23.328
There will always be fine press books.

25:23.768 --> 25:24.349
Exactly.

25:24.369 --> 25:24.969
So what happened?

25:25.029 --> 25:29.473
I mean, since the impressionism, post-impressionism, everything else.

25:29.493 --> 25:32.235
Well, there's this other interesting thing happened.

25:32.255 --> 25:35.558
Have you noticed if you go into flax or art stores,

25:36.061 --> 25:42.651
People have this incredible variety of paper that will now feed through laser printers.

25:42.691 --> 25:47.018
So people have this, they now know that they can create all the ink.

25:48.881 --> 25:54.950
Now they want to go buy the special paper so that they have something unique about their thing that they're producing.

25:55.812 --> 25:58.035
Here's a gentleman, and I thought this was him.

25:59.095 --> 26:05.544
escapes me, but he's a pioneer in the computer field who collects dead media, old computers.

26:05.645 --> 26:08.108
Are you familiar with that?

26:08.128 --> 26:10.351
Yeah, yes.

26:10.872 --> 26:13.716
Is the book, in your view, destined to become a dead medium?

26:13.736 --> 26:16.560
No, it's going to outlast probably most of the media.

26:16.580 --> 26:26.655
I mean, I have a 1468 copy of Summa Theologica that was printed in basals.

26:27.007 --> 26:33.881
And it's just, it's on this, it's an incredible, oh, it was William Morris' copy, too.

26:34.723 --> 26:41.877
And it's on these incredible boards, original boards in the original chain that went to the library bench, you know, and the thing,

26:42.194 --> 26:49.387
The book was never pressed, and so the pages undulate with these impressions of the type, and it has this texture.

26:50.068 --> 26:50.970
It's just amazing.

26:50.990 --> 26:52.993
This thing's 550 years old.

26:55.177 --> 26:57.441
It's just an amazing piece.

26:57.461 --> 27:01.869
When you started this, did you even know the word incunabula, incunables?

27:02.130 --> 27:02.430
No.

27:02.849 --> 27:05.816
No, that was in the process of learning all of this.

27:05.836 --> 27:09.424
And did you contract any of the symptoms of the gentle madness?

27:09.745 --> 27:11.870
Oh, definitely I haven't.

27:12.792 --> 27:13.814
I'm not a boat buyer.

27:14.436 --> 27:17.222
I wouldn't go buy a collection.

27:18.705 --> 27:19.407
No, why not?

27:19.792 --> 27:21.335
Well, I don't know.

27:21.536 --> 27:25.585
He used to buy them 111 collections.

27:25.745 --> 27:26.006
Yes.

27:26.046 --> 27:28.953
And he said he bought the intelligence that went into forming it.

27:29.293 --> 27:29.554
Yes.

27:29.754 --> 27:35.387
So you're building the kind of collection that somebody like Huntington would come along and just snap up.

27:35.367 --> 27:36.949
Yeah, it's amazing.

27:36.969 --> 27:43.620
But it is interesting that you said that you were moved by the Printing and the Mind of Man exhibition in that catalogue.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.963
Do you have a name for your collection?

27:46.063 --> 27:49.969
No, it's just mine, Warnock Library or whatever.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.513
Would you call it a high spot collection?

27:52.593 --> 27:55.177
It is a high spot collection.

27:55.197 --> 28:00.345
I would definitely call it.

28:01.253 --> 28:09.163
First editions of Kant, Descartes, Hume, Berkeley, Hobbes.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.828
I'm trying to think.

28:13.128 --> 28:16.593
I have most of Einstein's papers.

28:18.795 --> 28:24.102
I have some original Mendel, which is rare.

28:24.703 --> 28:30.130
In economics, I have Ricardo, Adam Smith,

28:31.072 --> 28:33.596
and the first edition of Malthus.

28:34.797 --> 28:35.118
Of which?

28:35.158 --> 28:35.979
Malthus.

28:37.642 --> 28:39.584
Malthus.

28:39.725 --> 28:42.048
Are these people that you read in graduate school?

28:42.088 --> 28:42.348
Yes.

28:42.689 --> 28:43.009
Yeah.

28:43.690 --> 28:45.193
Samuel Johnson's.

28:45.213 --> 28:49.419
I got a three-volume by Samuel Johnson's dictionary, which is wonderful.

28:49.439 --> 28:51.882
I have the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

28:52.784 --> 28:56.609
Were you a great reader as a youngster?

28:57.310 --> 29:00.555
Well, because of the philosophy education, not as a youngster.

29:00.772 --> 29:01.614
but in college.

29:02.175 --> 29:06.324
Is there any book that you can think of that changed your life, that affected your life?

29:06.344 --> 29:07.867
Oh, a lot of them.

29:08.207 --> 29:09.550
Yeah, I think there are a lot of them.

29:09.570 --> 29:12.977
A lot of the philosophy books changed their life.

29:12.997 --> 29:14.501
Anyone in particular that you can think of?

29:14.521 --> 29:17.727
I don't mean to put you on this thought, but I am interested in another book.

29:18.128 --> 29:21.936
David Hume and the...

29:22.692 --> 29:34.187
I'm a Wittgenstein fan, so I have a lot of Wittgenstein's work, but that's more, that's later, 20th century kind of thing.

29:34.589 --> 29:40.536
The way philosophy was taught at Utah is you started out with Plato and Socrates and you say, oh, these guys got it right.

29:40.556 --> 29:44.081
And then you go every step of the way and you say, well, no, they didn't get it right.

29:44.101 --> 29:45.062
These guys got it right.

29:45.663 --> 29:52.892
And you sort of work up through the history of philosophy and you get something at each stage of the process.

29:53.292 --> 29:57.478
I did a Google search on you and it was amazing the various pieces that have been written about you.

29:57.498 --> 30:00.141
But there was one I was particularly impressed by is

30:00.374 --> 30:05.803
as you gave an interview to a high school girl down in San Jose.

30:06.343 --> 30:08.988
And I thought that was really a nice piece.

30:09.028 --> 30:10.730
Yes, she did a good job.

30:10.851 --> 30:25.133
Isn't that nice that you go and impress to these high school kids your feelings about education in the computer world and books and all that stuff?

30:26.075 --> 30:34.948
How do you weigh in on this following the Nick Baker double-fold business in the British Library, getting rid of those newspapers?

30:36.491 --> 30:38.614
I think he's probably right.

30:38.634 --> 30:41.779
I don't think he has one little quote from you in that book, but I was curious.

30:42.319 --> 30:51.373
I think that libraries do stupid things, and they're not immune from doing stupid things, and a lot of

30:52.366 --> 31:02.568
A lot of libraries have done stupid things like cut the spines off of books and put library bindings on books and things that drive book collectors crazy.

31:03.089 --> 31:12.670
Well, one of the points you mentioned at the Library of Congress conference was, and this whole conference was put together, basically how we can network and get people like John Warnock

31:12.818 --> 31:16.383
to give their collections to the library.

31:16.744 --> 31:19.749
And you said, you know, I want to know how you're going to use it.

31:19.829 --> 31:21.431
Not just that you're going to take care of it.

31:21.732 --> 31:22.172
That's right.

31:22.613 --> 31:23.254
Where was it going?

31:23.274 --> 31:24.456
You're getting 26,000.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.477
I got a number.

31:25.497 --> 31:28.241
They get 26,000 items a day.

31:28.642 --> 31:28.882
A day.

31:31.426 --> 31:32.548
And then you said,

31:32.917 --> 31:36.401
It's like Niagara Falls coming in and it's like a garden hose going out.

31:39.566 --> 31:42.850
I said that to the Librarian of Congress.

31:42.870 --> 31:46.755
He came to visit Octavo and I said, here's my problem with libraries.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.098
I said, especially the Library of Congress.

31:49.178 --> 31:56.627
I said, you've got 26 or 30,000 items a day coming in and nothing coming up.

31:56.647 --> 31:57.969
And how do you mean nothing coming up?

31:58.029 --> 31:58.930
What do you mean?

31:59.711 --> 32:00.633
Well, you've got to travel.

32:00.753 --> 32:01.033
Well,

32:01.570 --> 32:08.519
Fortunately, since that time, they've put their catalog online, and they've made access to at least the catalog.

32:08.680 --> 32:13.426
Now, they haven't made access to the work, but they've made at least access to the catalog.

32:13.506 --> 32:18.152
One of the ways you've described what you're doing with Octavo is that you're trying to create electronic paper.

32:18.453 --> 32:18.693
Yes.

32:19.554 --> 32:24.701
And of course, this again means replication of the original artifact.

32:24.741 --> 32:24.961
Yes.

32:25.262 --> 32:29.147
Now, I also noted that you emerged from the Xerox part group

32:29.414 --> 32:41.712
And there's a counterpart in Cambridge, you know, the MIT media, and I've been there, and I interviewed this young fellow named Joe Jacobson, who's doing this, what they call... Yes, electronic paper.

32:41.812 --> 32:43.654
Electronic paper with e-ink.

32:43.935 --> 32:44.356
That's right.

32:44.376 --> 32:50.184
But they call it, they codenamed it the last book, the last book you'll ever need.

32:50.745 --> 32:52.367
Now, clearly, this is not...

32:52.786 --> 32:54.909
the direction you're bringing in.

32:55.249 --> 32:56.611
But how do you feel about that?

32:56.631 --> 33:02.838
Well, I think it's interesting technology, and I think actually the technology will be sort of useful for a lot of things.

33:03.619 --> 33:12.370
But I would never bet on any single technology to sort of be the final answer for any of this stuff.

33:12.410 --> 33:18.017
And the thing that I'm going to say next Monday in my talk to the ALA is, you know,

33:18.233 --> 33:25.722
All the technological advances in printing and publishing have always given the librarian an artifact at the end, namely this book.

33:26.763 --> 33:33.230
And then you've never cared how that book's produced, what intellectual processes go in.

33:33.270 --> 33:34.772
You get the book.

33:34.792 --> 33:39.337
Your job is to protect this book and make the stuff in it accessible to people.

33:39.357 --> 33:43.482
And then that view of a library is out of date.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.678
And has been replaced by what?

33:46.818 --> 33:59.673
And will be placed over time with the fact that there's going to be a companion electronic set of documents and information services, and they have it in their bibliography files right now, but in the content itself.

33:59.733 --> 34:06.621
And it's going to be very important how the thing was produced and how it spews out information and interrelates information to other content.

34:07.362 --> 34:10.566
And so you get to stop thinking about the book as an artifact.

34:10.765 --> 34:15.689
and start thinking about the wider problem of information management and storage and technology.

34:16.951 --> 34:25.939
And not worrying about whether they give you another artifact, like a CD, but worry about this live body of knowledge that will go forward.

34:26.399 --> 34:34.387
You know, there's a very interesting statistic, and I cited it, and I will send you a copy, by the way, if you'd like, to see all these proofs of this little book.

34:34.407 --> 34:38.190
And then the book that you're going to be in is the book that follows this one that's coming out in October.

34:38.609 --> 34:58.295
But I did find a study, a Mellon study, which demonstrates that when acquisitions of monographs at major research universities, like Berkeley, for instance, goes down, the number of PhDs granted goes down.

34:58.655 --> 35:05.224
If you cut back on your acquisitions budget for monographs, I'm not talking about strictly printed books,

35:05.744 --> 35:07.807
That goes down, and I've taken it forward.

35:07.827 --> 35:22.529
That study was published in 1992, and the ALA statistics show that when Berkeley was, you know, the big thing that was going on over here, and I discussed this in the new book, that over the last five or six years, they led the nation in PhDs granted, but they went down.

35:22.970 --> 35:31.803
Stanford passed them by, somebody else passed them by, but in the last two years, when they started putting more money into the collections, the PhDs granted have gone.

35:32.103 --> 35:34.587
I mean, do you see anything?

35:34.752 --> 35:38.558
Did you get correlations with the other universities?

35:38.658 --> 35:40.921
It's very interesting.

35:41.201 --> 35:56.744
In fact, this data that was published in 1992, and I cite it in the book, is compiled from ALA statistics from the 20th century, clearly, but it didn't really take into account what's happened since 1992.

35:56.804 --> 35:58.887
Therein probably lies the more pertinent

35:59.170 --> 36:00.311
data, it would seem to me.

36:00.331 --> 36:05.218
I mean, was there the Vietnam War in the middle or something that could also have had an effect?

36:05.238 --> 36:09.383
Yeah, well, you know, these are social ethics.

36:09.523 --> 36:13.168
But that was the big battle that was going on out here at Berkeley.

36:13.188 --> 36:16.392
I guess I'm pointing to it correctly.

36:16.412 --> 36:16.812
Yeah, exactly.

36:17.093 --> 36:17.533
I don't know.

36:17.894 --> 36:18.314
I don't know.

36:19.816 --> 36:28.587
I know that I find the internet is becoming a potentially marvelous resource.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.231
for getting stuff that you could never find.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.955
I mean, Bookfinder is wonderful.

36:34.975 --> 36:38.058
Well, I mean, I'm a perfect example.

36:38.078 --> 36:39.359
I'm 58 years old.

36:39.460 --> 36:42.563
My first book, Gentle Madness, I started back in the late 80s.

36:44.024 --> 36:50.110
I got stuff for this new book that was through sources that were never available to me.

36:50.330 --> 36:50.831
That's right.

36:50.851 --> 36:54.274
LexisNexis, Google, J-Store.

36:54.294 --> 36:56.136
Just amazing to go to J-Store.

36:56.156 --> 36:57.257
People are going to be amazed.

36:57.592 --> 37:06.525
Where the heck does he find out about how Cardinal Borromeo got this library and, you know, where did they find that renaissance today?

37:06.585 --> 37:13.014
Well, you know, you go to JSTOR and you do a search for Borromeo in books and you get an extraordinary hit.

37:13.414 --> 37:17.760
That kind of stuff, you know, it just makes research certain.

37:17.780 --> 37:18.782
Yes, it makes it.

37:18.802 --> 37:23.869
But you're never going to scan, as the Director General of the British Library says, do you think that we're going to digitize?

37:24.119 --> 37:27.223
Every book in our collection, it would cost 50 billion pounds to do that.

37:27.564 --> 37:30.608
Well, but that's in today's crisis, and that's very short-sighted.

37:30.688 --> 37:33.271
Labor is always going to be expensive, isn't it?

37:33.291 --> 37:36.375
Yeah, but that's assuming that there needs to be labor.

37:36.416 --> 37:45.608
I saw a device the other day that you put the book down, it turns the pages with this incredible robotic system at 90 pages a minute.

37:45.628 --> 37:46.609
I'm ready to see this.

37:46.629 --> 37:50.194
This is a startup company that started out of Switzerland.

37:50.545 --> 37:54.030
And you can imagine it doesn't damage the pages.

37:54.070 --> 38:01.600
It handles them better than any human can because it uses a vacuum system and it barely touches them and turns them very quickly.

38:01.620 --> 38:05.144
And it has a camera system that goes click, click, click, click and starts doing it.

38:05.685 --> 38:10.752
And you can automate the human out of the process.

38:11.032 --> 38:15.157
You can automate the converting of the OCRing of text.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.662
I mean, the technology is not all there yet, but it's getting there.

38:19.368 --> 38:46.827
and you know to put 50 million pounds and saying i'm giving up at the beginning because i can't get there from here in today's economics is the wrong way to think about it so what happens if the british library goes and scans has the capability and can afford to scan all the books in its collection what should they then do with the with the artifact they should keep them they should put them in a very good human because you don't want to make the mistake that the

38:47.380 --> 38:54.007
you know, that the microfilmers made, or any of the other things, because there may be something left to get out of these things.

38:54.027 --> 39:06.981
You know, the Cornell Project, which I write about, not to any great length, but they did 10,000 books, which were, you know, free of any kind of copyright constraints, so they were old, basically 19th century books.

39:07.722 --> 39:14.228
But they went and they scanned the pages, and they made a hard copy, but then they threw away the, you know, these were all guillotine.

39:14.288 --> 39:15.750
That's dumb!

39:16.034 --> 39:18.316
Well, they sliced the bindings off.

39:18.336 --> 39:19.677
They did all kinds of stupid things.

39:19.697 --> 39:21.299
They looked like veal cutlets.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.481
They were stripped, and they were dressed, and they were ready.

39:24.282 --> 39:26.284
They had to be drawn and quartered.

39:28.045 --> 39:30.388
It's a cultural offense, isn't it?

39:30.528 --> 39:32.149
It is a cultural offense.

39:32.289 --> 39:38.175
I'm glad you... Are you familiar with this fellow by the name of Ray Kurzweil?

39:38.235 --> 39:40.037
Yes, I knew Ray.

39:40.137 --> 39:42.379
Of course, when you mention to him, he believes that

39:43.034 --> 39:45.938
You know, I mean, it's almost, he gives you this dismissive look.

39:45.958 --> 39:53.770
I mean, he thinks that print is dead by the end of the decade, and that hundred years... Ray's been wrong before.

39:53.790 --> 39:54.651
I can quote you on that?

39:54.671 --> 39:57.996
Sure.

39:58.016 --> 40:04.485
And I also read, and I love this particular, you say that barely a day goes by when you don't write

40:04.651 --> 40:05.953
some kind of code.

40:05.973 --> 40:08.318
You're not working on writing it.

40:08.398 --> 40:09.360
Is that a factor?

40:09.400 --> 40:12.325
Yeah, I still use computers every day.

40:12.385 --> 40:14.790
But I mean, were you actually creating a code?

40:14.810 --> 40:16.854
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

40:16.974 --> 40:24.668
I probably don't do that every day anymore, but I still keep my hands in the technology and the products a lot.

40:25.137 --> 40:30.263
Is this kind of an exercise for you, not unlike, say, a poet composing a poem every day?

40:30.463 --> 40:32.786
Do you see parallels in the creative process?

40:32.886 --> 40:34.428
Is there an art to this, I guess?

40:34.448 --> 40:36.150
Oh, yes, very definitely.

40:36.170 --> 40:47.162
And what you want to do is keep in touch with the technology to be able to anticipate what wasn't possible five years ago now is possible.

40:47.530 --> 40:51.256
In other words, what can I pull off today that I couldn't pull off five years ago?

40:51.356 --> 40:57.084
How have the tools advanced in such a way that I now can solve a problem that I couldn't solve before?

40:57.104 --> 41:00.469
And if that problem is economic and has value.

41:00.810 --> 41:08.461
When you look at a software or study a software, can you see the hand of an individual, say, the way you can read a favorite author and say, I know what's the latest.

41:08.481 --> 41:10.544
Oh, programmers do.

41:10.725 --> 41:13.008
There's a book that you should look up if you can find it.

41:15.592 --> 41:17.014
It's called Programmers at Work.

41:17.517 --> 41:44.976
programmers at work and it was done by microsoft press it's out of print bibliophile book finder book finder yeah book finder microsoft and the thrust of this uh it's interviews in the early 80s with all of who were supposed to be the great programmers i'm included in it i feel very complimented that i was included in it but uh

41:45.158 --> 41:52.086
Bill Gates is there, and Gary Kildall, and all of the people who started the personal computer revolution.

41:52.106 --> 41:59.053
And you can get the personalities from these interviews, I think.

41:59.554 --> 42:07.603
But you can get the personality of Sean Monaghan from Octavo?

42:07.663 --> 42:11.267
Well, you know, you can see what drives the thinking.

42:11.872 --> 42:16.820
I don't know that you could get that from code, but... Well, but I mean, in terms of what it does.

42:16.840 --> 42:17.180
Yeah.

42:17.721 --> 42:32.884
I think one of the, again, I'm really well, out of, over my head when it comes to discussing this, entering these areas, but I think one of the things you were quoted as saying, one of the duties of your company, Adobe and

42:33.185 --> 42:36.769
is that it really does reflect the personalities of a few people.

42:37.189 --> 42:38.610
Who's not a big IBM person?

42:38.630 --> 42:47.139
Well, I'm an amateur painter, and I think of myself as a very visual person.

42:47.159 --> 43:02.955
And all of Adobe's products are really trying to focus on how you bring sort of the left side of the brain together with the right side of the brain and make artists be able to use the tools that in the past they couldn't use.

43:03.340 --> 43:04.522
because they were too techy.

43:05.203 --> 43:12.634
I mean, and you really need somebody who straddles the fence to see both sides and who knows what the value systems on both sides are.

43:12.654 --> 43:16.440
Now, you're meeting today with members of the Rare Books and Manuscripts section.

43:16.460 --> 43:32.824
How important are these people to... Well, I would love... I mean, I will never own all the great books, and what you obviously want to do is you want to get as many of the people who have collected these things to feel it's important to share them

43:33.175 --> 43:39.366
as possible, and the libraries to get on board so that you can make them accessible.

43:39.787 --> 43:48.744
Now, this is probably not an area that you get into because you quite specifically say that you are interested primarily in the printed book and not manuscripts.

43:48.764 --> 43:55.015
But I wonder how a technology like this would impact a place like the HRC at the University of Texas, where there

43:55.433 --> 43:59.960
the greatness of their collection is in their literary manuscripts, which by definition are unique.

44:00.301 --> 44:02.224
They really don't want replication.

44:02.244 --> 44:07.372
I mean, their greatness is probably derived from... But they should be photographed.

44:07.472 --> 44:14.944
I mean, like we're doing the Mozart and Beethoven manuscripts from the Library of Congress, and, you know, a music student... I mean,

44:15.380 --> 44:18.705
Mozart, it came out of his head onto paper in real time.

44:19.345 --> 44:23.271
I mean, this guy was unbelievable, and you can sort of see it in the scrawl.

44:23.431 --> 44:25.494
I mean, he was writing furious.

44:25.514 --> 44:26.395
The energy is there.

44:26.415 --> 44:29.720
The energy is there, and you can see the energy.

44:29.740 --> 44:31.282
Do you want the manuscripts?

44:32.283 --> 44:33.125
I think.

44:33.145 --> 44:34.907
Do you have any questions for John?

44:35.174 --> 44:41.084
I know you're just exceedingly busy, so I don't want to over... No, I enjoyed this.

44:41.866 --> 44:42.387
Interesting.

44:42.467 --> 44:46.133
I'm just going to flip that your son picked out that first book for you.

44:46.153 --> 44:46.394
Yes.

44:46.414 --> 44:47.916
He was only 20 years old.

44:47.936 --> 44:50.360
He was quite young to realize.

44:50.380 --> 44:58.735
Well, he knew my interest in mathematics, and I'd never seen a book that old or...

44:59.457 --> 45:01.981
on a subject that I was that interested in before.

45:02.021 --> 45:04.224
And you picked it up and you handled it?

45:04.344 --> 45:07.769
Was there a magical kind of... Oh, absolutely.

45:07.789 --> 45:08.851
I just... What did you feel?

45:08.871 --> 45:09.552
I mean, can you describe it?

45:09.572 --> 45:10.714
I have to own this book.

45:14.139 --> 45:15.641
I have to own this book.

45:16.562 --> 45:23.653
You've been also quoted as saying that xerography, because you are involved in desktop publishing, remains inferior to typesetting.

45:24.113 --> 45:26.978
Is that something that's about to... Well, yes, it is.

45:27.238 --> 45:28.620
I mean, from just the...

45:28.837 --> 45:41.676
the longevity of the, the toners are getting really good, and the inkjets, the current day inkjets actually are archival, and the inks will last 200 years, and so they're getting there.

45:41.696 --> 45:43.939
The inks are getting much better, the papers are better.

45:45.822 --> 45:51.250
I think I've covered, you know, is there anything else you think?

45:52.973 --> 45:58.641
Well, I, you know, and I've never, I haven't talked to them, I, John Fry is,

45:59.077 --> 46:02.302
one of the only other collectors I've really talked to in depth.

46:02.482 --> 46:07.049
He collects man-to-manics and fries electronic stores all over the West Coast.

46:09.713 --> 46:17.565
But I think I'm the only one driven to make it all available that I have seen.

46:17.585 --> 46:21.912
And not only to make it all available, but you've taken really

46:22.415 --> 46:25.099
heroic status to do it.

46:25.199 --> 46:30.646
And do you see this company as something that obviously profitability matters, I'm sure.

46:30.726 --> 46:32.648
Here's the basic business model.

46:32.668 --> 46:36.674
The basic business model is that the market for any one of these books is really small.

46:37.975 --> 46:42.882
In other words, the number of people who are going to really go out and buy one of these, I think it's small.

46:42.902 --> 46:47.528
But as you build the library and the number that you have,

46:47.980 --> 46:49.763
The revenue line sort of follows it.

46:50.143 --> 46:55.792
And the cost of continuing to digitize and getting libraries to digitize and contribute is fairly constant.

46:55.812 --> 46:57.714
Can I take a couple of pictures of you, by the way?

46:57.734 --> 46:57.955
Sure.

46:58.015 --> 46:58.395
No, that's fine.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.579
I like the way you're doing that stuff with the hands.

47:00.719 --> 47:04.084
I'm sorry.

47:04.164 --> 47:04.464
Anyway.

47:04.965 --> 47:10.113
So the revenue curve and the cost is fairly constant.

47:10.133 --> 47:16.502
So the whole idea behind Octavo is to get enough, over the years, to get enough content out there

47:16.955 --> 47:19.519
so that the thing crosses over.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.023
You don't have the production costs on the web.

47:22.805 --> 47:25.329
So I don't have to print books.

47:25.349 --> 47:26.851
OK, I don't have to hold inventory.

47:27.392 --> 47:29.896
All I have to do is build electronic content.

47:29.917 --> 47:34.684
And then over time, that cost is fairly minimal.

47:35.025 --> 47:41.997
The storage cost is fairly minimal relative to the number of people that you can reach, the content that you can provide.

47:42.017 --> 47:42.878
And to go back,

47:43.229 --> 47:46.212
this did develop out of your collection?

47:46.272 --> 47:46.873
Oh, yes.

47:47.033 --> 47:58.265
Yeah, it was that realization of the lack of knowledge that people have about rare books and their access to, I mean, including my own.

47:58.405 --> 48:13.000
I mean, I'm sure that there are people who grow up in libraries who know that these things exist, but, I mean, I did research in mathematics, and I went to the library all the time, and it never occurred to me to go look at the original books.

48:13.874 --> 48:16.499
And what was the first book that we chose to do?

48:16.519 --> 48:18.783
Was there any special significance?

48:18.803 --> 48:21.147
Oh, that we did at a cover?

48:21.287 --> 48:23.932
It was Shakespeare's collection of poems.

48:24.012 --> 48:25.896
It was done in 1640.

48:26.076 --> 48:29.442
It's terrible printing.

48:29.462 --> 48:30.143
Terrible.

48:30.163 --> 48:31.526
I mean, awful example.

48:31.606 --> 48:38.278
The book is only this big, but it was always collected poems, and it was a first edition that I happened to have.

48:38.748 --> 48:42.976
So you actually chose the humanities for your debut.

48:42.996 --> 48:43.216
Yes.

48:44.118 --> 48:48.746
I have a second folio, but I wanted to get a first folio out of the Folger.

48:50.810 --> 48:57.702
We also picked it because it would be a popular book that people would understand.

48:58.424 --> 49:00.226
That is Shakespeare's, yeah.

49:00.246 --> 49:13.722
And it's amazing when I gave the book talks, I would always take the Shakespeare because it was this little unassuming book that's this big, and you hand it to them and say, this is a first edition of Shakespeare's poems, and they go like this.

49:13.963 --> 49:16.366
They say, wait a minute.

49:18.648 --> 49:25.917
There's another quote, I don't recall where I got it, but we are quoted as saying, I really enjoy seeing other people use the fruits of my labor.

49:26.302 --> 49:26.883
Oh, yes.

49:26.963 --> 49:37.300
And I wonder if you could just elaborate on that particular... Both my partner and I were at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.

49:37.320 --> 49:41.006
And the research that was done there was totally amazing.

49:41.526 --> 49:44.712
I mean, we had desktop computers in 1978.

49:45.934 --> 49:48.077
We had email systems in 1978.

49:48.798 --> 49:49.339
We had...

49:49.690 --> 49:51.914
Word-like word processors.

49:51.934 --> 49:52.916
Why didn't they come out?

49:52.936 --> 49:53.237
What happened?

49:53.257 --> 49:56.002
Well, they didn't exploit any of it.

49:56.022 --> 50:08.526
And we were doing printing research, and we came to the realization that the corporation that we worked through, that we were going to invent everything that was interesting, and none of it was going to see the light of day.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.310
So you became frustrated?

50:11.330 --> 50:13.273
We were incredibly frustrated.

50:13.293 --> 50:14.695
I mean, we tried to work the system.

50:14.755 --> 50:16.858
We tried to get them to appreciate what they had.

50:18.019 --> 50:19.361
Was this a corporate problem?

50:19.381 --> 50:22.586
It was a huge corporate problem.

50:22.706 --> 50:25.350
Lack of vision is what it was.

50:25.931 --> 50:27.733
So we decided to leave.

50:29.396 --> 50:33.822
And we wanted the company, above all else, to build products that people used.

50:34.460 --> 50:36.762
Did you have any idea that you would be... No.

50:36.802 --> 50:38.884
...where you went?

50:39.344 --> 50:40.265
No.

50:40.285 --> 50:51.195
And as you described how far-reaching your product now... We had no conception that it would have that kind of traction and that kind of acceptance.

50:51.235 --> 50:53.537
So as an initial goal, what was the initial goal?

50:54.517 --> 50:59.982
Built some interesting printers, built some interesting technology that would help the printing process.

51:00.122 --> 51:03.285
We had no... The timing was so perfect.

51:03.704 --> 51:07.051
Canon came out with its very first low-cost laser printer.

51:07.852 --> 51:10.518
The Mac came out with the first graphical user interface.

51:11.079 --> 51:21.380
All this built page maker we had PostScript, it all came together, and desktop publishing sort of sprung out of the earth, and that took over the entire publishing world.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.063
And so you're a publisher?

51:23.262 --> 51:24.083
Yeah.

51:24.844 --> 51:31.393
And it did take a while for this to catch on in many areas, didn't it?

51:31.413 --> 51:42.587
Well, we obviously couldn't handle, in the early days of the little teeny Macs, we couldn't handle four-color publishing, but now almost every magazine on the planet

51:42.938 --> 51:43.699
users are still.

51:44.019 --> 51:45.681
What do you think of this printing on demand?

51:46.022 --> 51:48.305
I think it's going to take off.

51:48.505 --> 51:53.612
I think book publishers are going to not want to keep inventories.

51:53.632 --> 51:55.354
They're going to want to put out a lot of titles.

51:55.394 --> 51:57.857
They're going to want to bring back titles back into print.

51:58.918 --> 52:02.062
And the print on demand stuff can make that happen.

52:05.367 --> 52:07.549
He's very graciously given us an hour of his time.

52:07.649 --> 52:09.672
Is there any, do you mind if we

52:10.310 --> 52:11.771
I contact you for some follow-up.

52:11.891 --> 52:13.293
Oh, not at all.

52:13.413 --> 52:15.895
No, no, let me get it.

52:18.658 --> 52:28.326
Oh, you're welcome.

52:28.967 --> 52:30.308
Well, welcome to San Francisco.

52:30.328 --> 52:32.490
It doesn't well be on the website today.

52:32.730 --> 52:37.214
We're going to make all the books downloadable from the website.

52:37.234 --> 52:38.916
They're big files, but they're

52:39.014 --> 52:41.940
So it's no longer just CDs?

52:42.281 --> 52:42.541
Yeah.

52:42.962 --> 52:44.546
Well, you can browse the books today.

52:44.566 --> 52:46.450
If you go up there, you can browse all the books.

52:46.470 --> 52:47.111
And how about texts?

52:47.131 --> 52:49.155
Is the text searchable?

52:49.756 --> 52:51.961
On most of the CDs, it is.

52:52.282 --> 52:56.230
So on the Shakespeare, there is text for the entire Shakespeare births folio.

52:56.767 --> 53:02.454
Even with those 16th century, 17th century printing?

53:03.596 --> 53:06.439
Yeah, and when you search it, it'll find the words.

53:06.459 --> 53:09.463
How did you solve that particular problem?

53:09.583 --> 53:17.593
We had the text from the first folio, and we matched it up with the images and buried it behind it so that in the search technology, you find it.

53:17.573 --> 53:27.608
The other interesting thing that we're doing is a collaboration with all of the libraries.

53:27.648 --> 53:36.021
We're trying to get every single Porto that was published, Shakespeare Porto, and digitize them all in one group.

53:36.575 --> 53:38.538
So you must be working on the Huntington Library.

53:38.558 --> 53:43.987
Huntington Library, the Folger Library, the British Library, the Library of Congress, all of the people.

53:44.007 --> 53:46.571
They have that great collection down at Huntington.

53:46.591 --> 53:53.422
In fact, the University of California Press printed, and you must be familiar with the Norton facsimile of Forrest Folio.

53:53.442 --> 53:58.110
Now that is a book that takes, the Folger has 79 Forrest Folios.

53:58.130 --> 53:58.971
That's right.

53:59.356 --> 54:01.779
So they took the best of all different pages.

54:01.939 --> 54:04.323
What we did is we took the best of all of them.

54:04.343 --> 54:05.865
So you did the same, you just took one?

54:06.005 --> 54:09.670
We took the, we said, you pick, now I don't want to mix that.

54:09.750 --> 54:13.555
I guess this is what I'm driving at, you know, because Hinman actually made a, he made a hybrid.

54:13.595 --> 54:14.296
Yuck!

54:14.316 --> 54:18.141
Yes, I had thought of that, but that is a question for you, so you don't want to do that.

54:18.342 --> 54:18.582
No.

54:19.143 --> 54:21.406
Because, I mean, it's not synergy.

54:23.389 --> 54:23.729
No.

54:23.789 --> 54:26.012
What's wrong with that, just out of curiosity?

54:26.052 --> 54:26.753
It's not a book.

54:27.554 --> 54:28.215
It's not a book.

54:28.432 --> 54:29.734
It's not a thought.

54:29.754 --> 54:33.718
I mean, if there were warts and flies, then they should be present.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.020
They should be.

54:35.100 --> 54:40.967
My copy of the Shakespeare poems, the bottom half of the title page is forged.

54:41.708 --> 54:43.570
It was forged by Quaritch in 1940.

54:43.751 --> 54:46.874
And I didn't know it when I bought it, but that's okay.

54:48.476 --> 54:56.346
But it's such brilliant forgery, except they misspelled the printer's name and the forgery.

54:56.528 --> 54:58.291
And that's how you can tell.

54:58.731 --> 55:07.845
But we describe it in the CD, hey, this first page is forged, second half, you can see, da-da-da, that's what the book is.

55:08.326 --> 55:09.888
I mean, you know, the book is the book.

55:10.549 --> 55:13.234
So the collection is approximately 100 volumes?

55:13.274 --> 55:13.554
Yes.

55:13.935 --> 55:15.898
And is it open-ended, or...?

55:16.318 --> 55:17.480
Oh, yeah.

55:17.500 --> 55:22.047
No, it's... I have some weird things.

55:23.967 --> 55:29.835
Some truly beautiful books and some weird things.

55:31.016 --> 55:34.000
I have this book that was woven on a jacquard loom.

55:34.020 --> 55:35.222
Have you ever seen this book?

55:35.262 --> 55:35.382
No.

55:35.682 --> 55:37.164
What is the book again?

55:37.285 --> 55:38.526
It's a book of prayer.

55:39.167 --> 55:39.928
It's in French.

55:40.569 --> 55:52.084
It was woven in 1859 on a jacquard loom at 240 threads to the inch in silk.

55:53.144 --> 55:54.866
And they printed on this?

55:55.447 --> 55:56.549
No, it's woven.

55:57.049 --> 55:58.431
It's the first digital book.

56:00.194 --> 56:01.075
It was woven.

56:01.375 --> 56:04.599
They built punch cards for every bit, for every thread.

56:04.980 --> 56:06.322
This is a unique book.

56:07.263 --> 56:08.785
No, they made about 50 copies.

56:09.967 --> 56:13.552
But the thing is an incredible tour de force in technology.

56:14.293 --> 56:15.975
Because it truly is a digital book.

56:16.015 --> 56:17.257
It's the most amazing book.

56:17.297 --> 56:18.358
It just glistens.

56:18.524 --> 56:20.627
Where would I find something on this?

56:20.807 --> 56:22.169
It's over at Octavo right now.

56:22.229 --> 56:24.412
If you're going to visit Octavo, they have it.

56:24.833 --> 56:25.935
They have it?

56:25.955 --> 56:26.435
Yeah.

56:26.535 --> 56:27.797
And what should I ask about the book?

56:27.817 --> 56:28.558
The woven book.

56:28.899 --> 56:30.942
The woven book.

56:30.962 --> 56:31.182
Yes.

56:32.043 --> 56:32.965
The threads actually go through.

56:33.005 --> 56:35.248
The black and silver threads.

56:35.769 --> 56:36.850
Let's chat about that.

56:37.010 --> 56:38.913
It is totally amazing.

56:38.973 --> 56:40.435
I can send you some images from the book.

56:40.455 --> 56:41.036
Could you do that?

56:41.257 --> 56:42.038
Yeah.

56:42.158 --> 56:45.763
But to see this book is just unbelievable.

56:46.486 --> 56:49.371
Where should I send you a set of the proofs?

56:49.391 --> 56:51.093
260 Surrey Place.

56:51.574 --> 56:52.996
Surrey.

56:53.057 --> 56:54.459
S-U-R-R-E-Y.

56:55.260 --> 56:55.360
Okay.

56:55.641 --> 56:56.242
Place.

56:56.562 --> 56:57.243
Los Altos.

56:58.866 --> 56:59.387
94022.

56:59.427 --> 56:59.747
94022.

57:00.529 --> 57:01.150
Yep.

57:02.392 --> 57:05.777
So this interview, I believe, will be the...

57:06.010 --> 57:10.216
the final comprised, the final chapter of the work in progress.

57:10.557 --> 57:10.917
Oh, great.

57:10.937 --> 57:17.467
Which is to be titled, Life Beyond Life, from Milton's Areopagitica, the books being the precious lifeblood of a mess.

57:17.487 --> 57:21.693
Octavo did a Milton's, I didn't buy a copy of Milton's Areopagitica.

57:21.973 --> 57:25.939
That's the famous quote.

57:25.959 --> 57:27.822
That's how I get that particular title.

57:27.902 --> 57:32.188
And then the subtitle is, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World.

57:33.270 --> 57:34.752
So I think that, I really,

57:35.423 --> 57:39.128
we really do straddle these worlds.

57:39.148 --> 57:46.657
And I think you'll see in this new book, Patience and Fortitude, I start with Otto Bettman, who straddled his world, straddled the 20th century.

57:46.737 --> 57:48.199
Is the Bettman archaic?

57:48.219 --> 57:51.903
The Bettman, but we did two interviews with him in Florida, and he was wonderful.

57:51.923 --> 58:01.735
Have you ever seen the Vesalius print where if you take all the plates of the man standing as he gets disassembled,

58:02.474 --> 58:09.463
There's a scenery behind it, and if you put them all together, the scenery stitches together to make one scene in Tuscany.

58:09.730 --> 58:10.171
Wow.

58:11.453 --> 58:12.694
Yeah, and no one does.

58:14.597 --> 58:15.338
Oh, absolutely.

58:16.360 --> 58:23.150
No, I'll send you a file that will have the stitched Vesaliuses together that are just amazing.

58:23.590 --> 58:24.832
You'll do that, Josh?

58:24.852 --> 58:26.274
I'll remind you, okay?

58:26.334 --> 58:27.656
Yeah, give me an email address.

58:27.937 --> 58:29.980
You'll get a PDF file in the mail.

58:30.100 --> 58:32.543
I'll send you an email.

58:32.644 --> 58:32.764
Okay.

58:32.784 --> 58:33.004
How's that?

58:33.457 --> 58:36.340
I have here Warnock at Adobe.com.

58:36.360 --> 58:36.640
Yes.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.683
And I mean, there are things you find out about this.

58:41.004 --> 58:49.111
And in the Vesalius edition, all of the drop caps in Vesalius were hand done for that edition.

58:49.131 --> 58:57.399
And they show cherubs robbing graves, dissecting people, carrying around organs.

58:57.859 --> 58:59.901
I mean, all these little drop caps.

58:59.961 --> 59:03.244
And there's a whole study just to do in the drop caps.

59:03.443 --> 59:07.108
Do you remember Dr. Norman's Veselius?

59:08.410 --> 59:11.053
He had the presentation copy for the emperor.

59:11.073 --> 59:12.715
Oh, it was colored, too, wasn't it?

59:12.735 --> 59:13.196
It was sort of.

59:13.236 --> 59:15.099
Yeah.

59:15.539 --> 59:18.944
But it was argued that that was the presentation.

59:18.984 --> 59:21.087
The royal purple finding.

59:21.107 --> 59:22.749
But it was excusable color.

59:23.690 --> 59:25.452
We have to point out.

59:25.492 --> 59:27.335
He didn't have a colored Fuchs, did he?

59:28.336 --> 59:28.897
I don't know.

59:28.957 --> 59:30.018
I've got the catalog.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.742
My copy of Fuchs is not colored.

59:33.869 --> 59:35.573
I'm not a big fan of McCulloch.

59:36.195 --> 59:36.836
I'm not either.

59:37.037 --> 59:37.679
Well, depending.

59:37.939 --> 59:41.027
Some of the books, I have this cosmographica.

59:41.649 --> 59:46.541
The cosmographica that I have is, the Library of Congress has one.

59:46.561 --> 59:47.423
You've got a cosmographica.

59:47.622 --> 59:50.888
See, I'm drinking my water.

59:50.928 --> 59:51.970
I'm going by Ptolemy.

59:52.010 --> 59:52.671
I mean, come on.

59:52.932 --> 59:54.254
You have a cosmographic.

59:54.275 --> 59:54.876
Yeah.

59:54.896 --> 59:58.923
And my copy's better than the Library of Congress's copy by a lot.

59:58.943 --> 01:00:02.690
It's got gold by a lot.

01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:03.973
Well, Mark Dimination.

01:00:03.993 --> 01:00:04.935
You feel like a little kid.

01:00:04.975 --> 01:00:07.419
Well, Mark and I always have these conversations.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:08.100
I say I have.

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.525
Well, he doesn't have a serious nonsense.

01:00:10.876 --> 01:00:13.359
And he wants my copy.

01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:14.921
What is that title, that book?

01:00:14.941 --> 01:00:16.023
Sidereus Nunces.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:21.390
That's Galileo's manual on the telescope, and there are only 24 copies out.

01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:29.500
So you must have booksellers from all over the world constantly contacting you.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.822
Is that an annoyance?

01:00:30.922 --> 01:00:33.205
I get a deluge of catalogs.

01:00:33.438 --> 01:00:38.845
No, it's actually... I thumb through them and see if there's something that strikes my eye.

01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:39.906
Have you made a catalog yet?

01:00:39.926 --> 01:00:41.788
Have you started a catalog yet in your collection?

01:00:42.048 --> 01:00:46.774
And I guess the question I haven't asked is, what do you plan to do with this collection?

01:00:46.814 --> 01:00:47.935
I haven't figured it out.

01:00:48.636 --> 01:00:51.840
I think my son would love to inherit this.

01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:54.243
He's the prime mover.

01:00:54.263 --> 01:00:59.269
He would love to end up with this collection.

01:01:00.511 --> 01:01:00.931
That's great.

01:01:01.712 --> 01:01:02.493
I love that.

01:01:02.633 --> 01:01:03.394
That's wonderful.

01:01:03.695 --> 01:01:07.801
We have a William Morris Chaucer.

01:01:07.821 --> 01:01:10.785
Is that one with paper?

01:01:11.065 --> 01:01:11.606
Paper.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.288
But I actually prefer the paper.

01:01:13.448 --> 01:01:14.670
It's in the pigskin binding.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:15.952
It's in the grape binding.

01:01:16.052 --> 01:01:17.494
Remember Sandy Berger's?

01:01:17.534 --> 01:01:18.755
The Doves Press binding.

01:01:19.557 --> 01:01:22.240
We went down to see Sandy Berger when we were doing Gentle Madness.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.983
It was down in Carmel.

01:01:24.543 --> 01:01:26.987
Oh, he's had the one with the real Morris collection.

01:01:27.007 --> 01:01:28.869
He had the Morris collection.

01:01:29.049 --> 01:01:30.091
And who bought that?

01:01:30.131 --> 01:01:31.212
The Huntington bought it.

01:01:31.232 --> 01:01:33.195
What's astonishing is that Victoria and Alba

01:01:33.597 --> 01:01:38.763
His collection was better than theirs, and they wouldn't raise, and it wasn't a lot of money, it was $10 million.

01:01:38.823 --> 01:01:39.845
No, it was only five.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.609
Well, I think it was five, that's right, but they valued it at 10.

01:01:43.929 --> 01:01:46.332
You got five, and they gave five.

01:01:47.714 --> 01:01:48.635
It's astonishing.

01:01:48.715 --> 01:01:49.076
I know.

01:01:49.116 --> 01:01:52.340
They were not, I mean, we're talking about a national treasure.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.424
The English are really stupid this way.

01:01:57.065 --> 01:01:58.046
I mean, they really are.

01:01:58.066 --> 01:02:01.090
They have left all of their national treasures out the door.

01:02:01.289 --> 01:02:08.282
You've retired, you're still chairman of Adobe, but clearly you're keeping your focus on it.

01:02:08.763 --> 01:02:11.528
Can you say that this is a pet baby of yours?

01:02:11.608 --> 01:02:12.430
Oh, absolutely.

01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:14.674
I also have a Lobachevsky.

01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:19.509
But it's a weird copy.

01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:26.219
It was sort of a compiled, but nevertheless, they're so rare that I didn't care.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.884
It's compiled from several different journals.

01:02:29.284 --> 01:02:30.867
Condition matters to you?

01:02:30.967 --> 01:02:32.950
Condition really matters to me, yes.

01:02:33.352 --> 01:02:41.541
So you're talking about your Darwin, so if you had an okay Darwin, all of a sudden you had a chance... Well, I got an association copy, yeah.

01:02:41.561 --> 01:02:49.029
Let's pick another example, but you had something that was kind of okay, but that's the copy that you have, but now you have a chance to get an extraordinary copy.

01:02:49.049 --> 01:02:49.249
I upgrade.

01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:51.832
You'll upgrade, but will you keep the other one, too?

01:02:52.012 --> 01:02:58.819
Actually, I had a Dialogo that was in its original boards, never been bound.

01:02:59.305 --> 01:03:02.330
OK, it was in original boards, but it didn't have the frontispiece.

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:07.477
But it really was a nice thing, but you almost couldn't handle it.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:15.509
Because you take it out of the box, and you barely didn't want to really turn the pages, because the strings were sort of fragile and everything.

01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:16.431
But it had never been bound.

01:03:17.552 --> 01:03:22.239
And then Quaritch got a copy, and it had a thick paper frontispiece.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:28.789
And apparently, most of the frontispieces on the Dialogos were put in on thin paper after.

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:32.101
And the thick one indicated this was one of the first ones.

01:03:32.322 --> 01:03:39.735
What I'm going to do when I send you a set of the proofs is I'm going to flag a chapter in there, a section that I want you to read on Abel Berland.

01:03:40.336 --> 01:03:53.359
Now what you won't see in the galleys in this set of proofs is that he has just announced, he told me that he's selling, he's just consigned this library to Christie's for an October sale.

01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:55.614
And this is this one with the first Vallejo?

01:03:55.654 --> 01:04:03.467
Yeah, but he has the most extraordinary William Blake's stand.

01:04:03.527 --> 01:04:07.994
We just did... He has the finest copy of Private Hand.

01:04:08.074 --> 01:04:10.377
I'll flag this for you, okay?

01:04:10.397 --> 01:04:12.040
Just read, and when you read it,

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:13.953
I have it in the present tense.

01:04:14.013 --> 01:04:16.496
I had to change it all to the past.

01:04:16.516 --> 01:04:20.821
Well, I hope the economy stays rotten so that I have a chance at this auction.

01:04:20.841 --> 01:04:24.226
Well, you'll see, he also, his collection is not unlike his.

01:04:24.246 --> 01:04:26.428
It's great books.

01:04:27.329 --> 01:04:29.032
His children are interested.

01:04:29.052 --> 01:04:33.497
This is a fellow that, he basically built the Sears Tower.

01:04:33.677 --> 01:04:33.798
Yeah.

01:04:33.818 --> 01:04:38.423
So, I mean, he has the means, certainly, to indulge it.

01:04:38.443 --> 01:04:41.487
He truly believes that

01:04:41.888 --> 01:04:48.316
To quote Robert Hull, if the collectors of the past hadn't have sold their books, where would I have gotten mine?

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:49.477
That's what he feels.

01:04:49.818 --> 01:04:51.399
He's unloaded.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.004
I'm very predisposed to do that.

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:58.508
I would have to figure out a really good reason not to do that.

01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:04.916
What is another first folio going to mean to the Folger Shakespeare?

01:05:05.096 --> 01:05:07.098
Yeah, nothing.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.883
So why shouldn't a collector who loves it

01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:16.786
and somebody pays X millions of dollars for it, I think is going to take good care of it.

01:05:16.806 --> 01:05:16.986
Yes.

01:05:17.627 --> 01:05:22.333
You know, it's not going to get shunted down in the basement of the British Library.

01:05:22.393 --> 01:05:23.955
Yeah, they, which happens.

01:05:24.035 --> 01:05:29.982
Which happens.

01:05:30.002 --> 01:05:34.107
Unlock it, then start the car, and then try to unlock it again.

01:05:34.127 --> 01:05:34.547
I don't want this.

01:05:34.567 --> 01:05:38.332
OK, all right.

01:05:38.352 --> 01:05:39.233
I did it.

01:05:44.984 --> 01:06:10.579
I love these.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:11.320
How's this for a parking spot, Barb?

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:11.600
There you go.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.021
Okay, it's not open.

01:06:13.283 --> 01:06:29.723
That's a slope of luck.
