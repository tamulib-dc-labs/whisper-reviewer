WEBVTT

00:04.115 --> 00:10.201
But this was the sort of thing that was going on.

00:10.342 --> 00:14.146
And so we didn't have any books.

00:14.166 --> 00:17.850
You know, immediately we decided, well, the best thing to do is learn something about the history.

00:18.690 --> 00:20.392
But we didn't have any books of history.

00:22.575 --> 00:26.379
And my teacher, you know, he said, well, these are the books that are important.

00:26.419 --> 00:27.159
Go out and find them.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.485
And then I went to India and looked around India for twenty years.

00:32.819 --> 00:35.543
until we could find those books.

00:35.884 --> 00:39.690
This was Deshing Rinpoche, who was a great historian.

00:42.894 --> 00:43.876
But we didn't have any books.

00:44.777 --> 00:48.283
So there we had the lamas, who could have taught us, but no books.

00:48.463 --> 00:51.127
And this is, you had early 70s or so?

00:51.347 --> 00:52.309
This was the 60s.

00:52.329 --> 00:52.870
60s.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.052
Early 60s.

00:54.412 --> 00:56.836
And all these Tibetan lamas come to New Delhi.

00:56.876 --> 00:57.817
They have one estate.

00:57.837 --> 00:59.840
They have one estate.

00:59.860 --> 01:00.902
He just opened the door.

01:01.169 --> 01:04.994
And he said, oh, you can't sleep here with six, seven, ten people.

01:05.754 --> 01:07.497
When I was up there, like ten, anything like that.

01:07.517 --> 01:23.876
But the very interesting thing is that his second teacher was called, he's all in Tingu Chintze, a dean teacher, and I took Gene's letter to him, and he said, you know, when I think about it, Gene, it's a shame you, he said, you can't look better than him.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.982
And he become also sort of such a good,

01:29.300 --> 01:32.953
He knows Tibetan extremists, 100% he knows.

01:33.274 --> 01:38.533
Therefore, he knows which tradition... I mean, all this...

01:38.868 --> 02:01.840
Tell me a little bit, if you don't mind, about your own background.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.044
How did you become expert on

02:05.193 --> 02:10.901
Well, I was just serious teaching for something that would keep me out of the draft.

02:10.921 --> 02:15.707
Well, are you—yeah, you worked for Elsie.

02:15.747 --> 02:16.828
Were you a librarian?

02:16.848 --> 02:17.529
Were you a scholar?

02:17.549 --> 02:18.651
No, I'm not a librarian.

02:18.731 --> 02:25.159
My field is basically—it was area studies in the old days when you didn't have to have a discipline.

02:25.820 --> 02:28.604
And I was interested in Asia as an area.

02:28.924 --> 02:30.587
Thank you.

02:30.607 --> 02:33.951
Tibetan and Mongolian, Turkish were my peers.

02:34.538 --> 02:40.265
And there was this opportunity when the Rockefeller Foundation set up this, the Rockefeller project.

02:40.305 --> 02:50.137
They brought, you know, incredible llamas to various places, and really provided Philip to the development of Tibetan studies in the West.

02:50.318 --> 02:53.762
So you were actually over there before you went to work for the L.C.?

02:53.782 --> 02:54.823
Oh, yeah.

02:54.843 --> 02:55.724
I was hired locally.

02:57.426 --> 03:03.634
And then the Library of Congress was interested in this project.

03:04.070 --> 03:09.578
You know, we had good support from people like Dan Borst and, you know, Jim Billington.

03:09.598 --> 03:13.003
I interviewed both.

03:13.023 --> 03:13.124
Yeah.

03:13.144 --> 03:19.393
So both of them were very supportive, and they understood the value of projects like this.

03:19.453 --> 03:28.246
Did they see it as a gathering for the Library of Congress or as an opportunity to preserve literature?

03:28.266 --> 03:28.727
I mean, as a...

03:29.129 --> 03:33.996
Yes, I mean, that's the mission of the Library of Congress.

03:34.116 --> 03:35.058
It's a world library.

03:36.059 --> 03:44.311
And this was an opportunity that was made possible by the fact that we had those resources.

03:44.331 --> 03:45.093
They said, go for it.

03:45.173 --> 03:57.651
Well, I think in a hundred years, British expedition went in Tibet, in the British, went in Tibet's army, but they brought out enormous Tibetan liberty, out from Tibet,

03:57.985 --> 04:08.640
the time when they took, everybody said, you stole it from Tibet, but if Britain, they didn't bring it from out to Europe, during the Cultural Revolution, it would be destroyed the whole thing.

04:08.660 --> 04:13.106
So now here, and they try to get copies, give it to the Tibet people.

04:13.147 --> 04:21.679
So therefore, the second thing you're coming into the West is not just the sort of only they bring it in here, sort of really preserve it externally.

04:21.699 --> 04:27.587
So therefore, a lab and machine is not just picking out a pinch from somewhere else, but

04:28.090 --> 04:29.291
coming over here so safe.

04:29.551 --> 04:34.396
I mean, you know, the two floors we have absolutely looking up.

04:34.436 --> 04:38.140
So there's a thousand, thousand fans looking up, no other places.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.823
So therefore not exactly pinching or machining anything like they preserve.

04:41.923 --> 04:42.984
That's what I find myself.

04:43.004 --> 04:51.953
And now's the time for the things to migrate back to the people that they can't, to whom they're the heritage.

04:51.973 --> 04:52.474
Which things?

04:52.534 --> 04:52.934
These things?

04:52.954 --> 04:53.355
Yeah.

04:53.695 --> 04:56.598
Copies, originals, they should go back.

04:57.218 --> 04:57.979
Go back to Tibet?

04:58.212 --> 05:02.258
Well, go back to Tibet when it's inappropriate.

05:02.298 --> 05:04.701
To Tibetans in the diaspora.

05:04.741 --> 05:05.943
The idea is to make them available.

05:06.664 --> 05:11.151
A perfect example is, for example, at the University of Virginia.

05:11.571 --> 05:16.318
Many graduate students go over with Fulbright scholarships to India to study a particular text.

05:17.099 --> 05:20.504
And they'll do a preliminary investigation contact.

05:20.584 --> 05:22.667
Someone says, I want to study this text.

05:22.782 --> 05:27.688
And half the time, they'll say, we'd love to teach you, but we don't have this text anymore.

05:27.848 --> 05:31.773
Texts that were printed in India over the past 35 years are now missing in India.

05:31.813 --> 05:34.136
They don't even have them in the Excel communities anymore.

05:34.557 --> 05:39.563
And so many times, the graduate students will say, well, listen, I'll bring over 20 copies of this text.

05:39.583 --> 05:40.724
I'll just make 20 photocopies.

05:40.764 --> 05:44.249
And you can keep them if you'll read this text with me.

05:44.949 --> 05:46.031
What would you call this place?

05:46.051 --> 05:47.793
Is this a repository?

05:48.153 --> 05:51.017
Repository.

05:51.250 --> 05:55.334
taking care of the material in trust until such time?

05:56.475 --> 05:57.256
That's my idea.

05:58.337 --> 05:59.719
Right now, people come here.

06:00.239 --> 06:04.443
I don't know, we have an enormous photocopying bill each.

06:07.687 --> 06:11.190
How many photocopies has Mr. Karma made?

06:13.573 --> 06:14.053
Thirty books.

06:14.594 --> 06:15.615
Thirty books?

06:15.955 --> 06:16.836
Thirty books.

06:17.288 --> 06:28.670
At this very gathering, I'm coming all the way from India, and so Karma's coming all the way from Bhutan.

06:29.070 --> 06:32.898
And Rumbu's coming all the way from England, to here.

06:32.918 --> 06:35.803
And here we have all the way from China, from Chengdu.

06:36.239 --> 06:39.383
And part of the reason is because of Gene.

06:39.403 --> 06:42.306
Gene knows the contents of every single one of these books.

06:42.326 --> 06:43.307
Gene, single-handedly.

06:44.308 --> 06:46.331
So is he known in all these places?

06:46.351 --> 06:47.032
Yes, he knows.

06:47.072 --> 06:47.612
He's the honey.

06:48.033 --> 06:48.694
Where the bee?

06:51.757 --> 06:56.383
If there's honey, there's bee.

06:56.423 --> 06:58.425
That's as fast as my bees.

06:58.445 --> 07:02.770
So even around the country, there may be a dozen collections like this.

07:02.918 --> 07:09.087
But without someone who knows the content, people can come in the door and say, Gene, I'm doing research on this.

07:09.427 --> 07:16.918
And he says, well, and he'll just pull a book off the shelf and say, here's... Give me just a wild example of some kind of research.

07:16.938 --> 07:17.999
Just a subject.

07:18.019 --> 07:19.121
I mean, example, Sheen.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.643
Mr. Sheen, he tried it.

07:20.663 --> 07:21.484
Did you remember?

07:21.504 --> 07:23.327
And then at one point, it's pretty good.

07:23.347 --> 07:26.191
The second, third, slowly, slowly, hardly everybody knows.

07:26.311 --> 07:27.232
It's really Gene.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.415
I think if Gene was here,

07:30.712 --> 07:36.137
I've never seen books like this, but can you tell me what I'm looking at?

07:36.157 --> 07:38.539
What do you call those cloth coverings?

07:39.099 --> 07:40.941
These are called pere.

07:40.981 --> 07:41.762
How do we spell that?

07:41.782 --> 07:44.164
P-E-R-E-Y, I guess.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.506
It means just book wrappers.

07:47.366 --> 07:48.688
All books should be wrapped.

07:48.728 --> 07:49.969
They shouldn't be left on the shelf.

07:50.009 --> 08:00.718
These are very messy because we don't have a skilled wrapper.

08:01.357 --> 08:04.920
The end flaps.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.983
Why don't you get that Dorje Cieba?

08:09.003 --> 08:10.445
There's a Dorje Cieba there.

08:10.465 --> 08:12.146
Is that the one you showed me?

08:12.166 --> 08:14.768
No, is there something significant about the color?

08:14.788 --> 08:15.509
I mean, does red?

08:15.529 --> 08:15.749
No.

08:15.969 --> 08:17.210
It just happens.

08:17.230 --> 08:17.891
It doesn't matter, right?

08:17.911 --> 08:19.812
It's kind of traditional, the monastic colors.

08:20.653 --> 08:21.274
Is it cotton?

08:22.615 --> 08:22.915
Whatever.

08:22.955 --> 08:25.697
Sometimes silk, if they're especially precious texts.

08:26.698 --> 08:28.860
Obviously, the silk is much more expensive.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.262
The flaps that you see at the end are the equivalent of spine labels.

08:31.563 --> 08:33.005
Right.

08:33.025 --> 08:34.026
Do they call them books?

08:34.186 --> 08:35.007
Are they called books?

08:35.167 --> 08:36.548
That's the translation.

08:36.789 --> 08:39.812
How do you spell it?

08:39.892 --> 08:42.234
P-E-C-H-A.

08:44.757 --> 08:54.347
Now, this is a great lama who I had known for a long time.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.770
We're talking about this book.

08:56.910 --> 08:59.713
Yeah, this is a typical, this is how a Tibetan book goes.

09:01.178 --> 09:08.806
This is one of the most famous texts in the Tibetan tradition, the Diamond Cutter Sutra.

09:14.853 --> 09:20.879
This shows the typical Tibetan thing.

09:20.999 --> 09:23.342
You have the wrapper.

09:23.762 --> 09:28.047
This is not really meant to be red.

09:29.613 --> 09:35.958
It's a—it's what's called a sungta— Just so that doesn't get my picture, this is just too bad.

09:36.639 --> 09:37.520
Thank you.

09:37.540 --> 09:54.354
It's a—it's a—a text that was calligraphed by a great teacher for a student, and then it was passed from the teacher.

09:54.374 --> 09:59.518
I didn't think the teacher was a—he was a great scholar, but his calligraphy leaves something to be desired.

09:59.971 --> 10:03.315
Now, how do you know all of this history?

10:03.335 --> 10:04.357
Is this contained?

10:04.417 --> 10:07.841
Because it was a, it was what's called Sumtenaran Nangan.

10:09.424 --> 10:13.349
And it was given to me as a relic, almost.

10:14.170 --> 10:14.891
Where was this?

10:15.291 --> 10:16.513
This was in India, years ago.

10:17.394 --> 10:29.370
It's calligraphed by a great eighteenth-century lama, Geetse Mahapandita.

10:29.671 --> 10:47.309
And Gita Mahapandita calligraphed this for one of his students.

10:47.329 --> 10:55.598
And it was passed down in the family from the time of the... Can I put this?

10:55.618 --> 10:57.600
The picture's too big.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.442
I just want to get the background stuff in there.

11:02.408 --> 11:10.164
Oh, that's exquisite.

11:12.048 --> 11:14.333
But, you know, it's not meant really as a book.

11:14.493 --> 11:17.119
It's more of a relic.

11:17.159 --> 11:23.151
We have hundreds of copies of the same text.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.182
Do you think it looks like Geto Mahapanita?

11:25.222 --> 11:28.946
Poor guy, he didn't have a good handwriting.

11:28.966 --> 11:29.987
Have you seen this before?

11:30.027 --> 11:33.071
I've seen some other text, yes.

11:33.091 --> 11:34.352
Do you think it's his handwriting?

11:34.913 --> 11:35.514
I'm not sure.

11:37.116 --> 11:37.376
I'm not sure.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.039
I've never seen his writings.

11:40.059 --> 11:41.521
But it's the first time you've seen this copy.

11:42.081 --> 11:43.143
No, I haven't seen this copy.

11:44.945 --> 11:45.325
It's very nice.

11:46.250 --> 12:01.750
It's paper that's been dyed in India ink, and then there's a layer of shellac to make it writable, and then gold ink.

12:03.072 --> 12:07.398
The thing is what Tracy is doing right now, putting the book on his head.

12:08.079 --> 12:09.741
Yeah.

12:09.881 --> 12:12.304
He puts it in his head.

12:12.324 --> 12:13.506
That's a sign of pain.

12:13.807 --> 12:16.491
That's a tradition.

12:17.212 --> 12:18.634
Very good.

12:22.319 --> 12:31.752
Excellent.

12:31.972 --> 12:36.559
Thank you.

12:36.579 --> 12:38.081
It's very good writing.

12:40.144 --> 12:43.088
Now, from your standpoint,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.454
This is what we would call a rare copy.

12:47.135 --> 12:48.497
The text, he already knows the text.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.340
So this text exists.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.182
It's part of the conjure.

12:52.202 --> 12:54.165
And many, many copies.

12:54.185 --> 12:56.749
And everybody prints it.

12:57.289 --> 12:59.412
Everybody knows it.

13:01.295 --> 13:02.436
So what is significant here?

13:02.456 --> 13:03.638
Is it the artifactual value?

13:03.718 --> 13:04.960
The artifactual value.

13:05.821 --> 13:08.004
It's worshipped almost.

13:08.845 --> 13:13.632
Now the lineage is gone because the student who passed it on in his lineage

13:13.882 --> 13:15.926
You know, his family lineage.

13:15.966 --> 13:16.528
They died out.

13:16.568 --> 13:18.472
Somebody said, oh, do you want this?

13:18.492 --> 13:19.594
It's supposed to be by Getse.

13:20.396 --> 13:20.857
Mahapandita.

13:20.877 --> 13:25.165
Well, I've been interested in Getse Mahapandita for many, many years.

13:25.206 --> 13:26.027
He was a great scholar.

13:26.969 --> 13:29.254
Unfortunately, we don't have his writings.

13:29.294 --> 13:30.937
We only have two volumes.

13:31.338 --> 13:32.160
There's in China.

13:32.309 --> 13:38.438
I met his incarnation.

13:38.498 --> 13:40.100
He died in Germany?

13:40.120 --> 13:40.681
He's in Germany?

13:40.921 --> 13:41.982
He died in Germany.

13:42.083 --> 13:42.423
Oh, yeah?

13:43.485 --> 13:49.553
This went from him to one of his chief disciples, and then it was passed down in the family.

13:51.235 --> 13:53.899
Very nice.

13:53.919 --> 13:58.165
And how long have you been at this location?

13:58.398 --> 13:59.420
We moved here.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.864
It really is not even open yet.

14:01.964 --> 14:04.388
It came here at 19.

14:04.548 --> 14:05.169
When was it?

14:05.189 --> 14:07.173
It was October, I guess.

14:08.254 --> 14:13.543
So you can see the use that it's getting, and it's not even officially open.

14:17.450 --> 14:17.610
Amazing.

14:17.630 --> 14:20.134
How many volumes would you say we have?

14:20.154 --> 14:20.935
20?

14:20.955 --> 14:22.698
I don't know.

14:23.219 --> 14:24.962
It's difficult to count.

14:25.212 --> 14:33.924
I shipped most of the books from Cairo by post, and 25 boxes went astray, so it's still a big problem knowing what's missing.

14:38.090 --> 14:40.773
You're missing part of the field for 80?

14:41.194 --> 14:44.278
No, it's more than field for 80.

14:44.318 --> 14:49.105
What I tried to do is go around the world and get microfilms and then blow them up.

14:49.145 --> 14:52.890
That's how I got those ones that you want, Ramachay.

14:53.461 --> 15:08.115
You see, nobody—you know, the user of something like that would come along once every ten years, I suppose, but today we found somebody who might like them.

15:08.135 --> 15:08.916
But that's not the point.

15:08.936 --> 15:09.997
The point's the habit, isn't it?

15:10.017 --> 15:10.137
No.

15:10.718 --> 15:11.078
That's right.

15:13.320 --> 15:13.881
It's wonderful.

15:13.941 --> 15:15.182
Wonderful story.

15:17.645 --> 15:21.088
But if this were in Tibet, these would be properly—

15:21.575 --> 15:22.797
They would be proper on the shelf.

15:22.837 --> 15:24.359
We would have proper da-da.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.784
They're in a mess right now.

15:31.108 --> 15:34.553
In the boxes, the labels have got jammed.

15:35.154 --> 15:36.355
We've had to do it that way.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.598
Are there multiple copies of the same text?

15:38.619 --> 15:38.839
No, no.

15:38.859 --> 15:39.860
These are all different texts?

15:39.880 --> 15:40.761
These are all different.

15:40.822 --> 15:41.883
All different.

15:42.384 --> 15:45.188
And most of this is material that was recovered?

15:46.149 --> 15:46.249
Yeah.

15:46.718 --> 15:49.482
From people who were refugees.

15:49.542 --> 15:58.876
Right, bringing copies with them, and then finding sponsors in the extra community, many of whom were... That's what it looks like.

15:58.956 --> 16:02.602
Amazing.

16:02.622 --> 16:06.748
Do any of these places... That's Kumbum, isn't it?

16:06.988 --> 16:08.170
No, no.

16:08.386 --> 16:09.027
Oh, no.

16:09.087 --> 16:11.832
The Gyancei Kumo, right.

16:12.092 --> 16:19.745
You see, this is the most famous, was one of the most famous conjures, I think, in the world.

16:19.865 --> 16:20.687
The temple.

16:20.727 --> 16:21.909
The Gyancei temple.

16:22.029 --> 16:28.039
This conjure was the source on which everything was copied.

16:28.079 --> 16:28.861
Which conjure?

16:29.221 --> 16:32.226
See how big those volumes are?

16:32.327 --> 16:33.769
Now they're just in a big hole.

16:34.238 --> 16:36.681
It just made me sad to see them.

16:36.801 --> 16:37.682
You saw them?

16:37.782 --> 16:38.924
I went to Tibet.

16:38.944 --> 16:40.025
There's an open-air pit.

16:40.185 --> 16:45.112
There's a big pit, and they're just crumpled up.

16:45.352 --> 16:46.213
This is inside?

16:46.453 --> 16:49.157
Inside the Tsongse Fort in Gyeongsang Fort.

16:49.797 --> 16:52.741
The Chinese are doing this?

16:52.841 --> 16:53.642
No, no.

16:53.682 --> 16:55.164
This happened during the Cultural Revolution.

16:55.184 --> 16:57.507
The Chinese are trying to do something now.

16:57.527 --> 16:59.149
I mean, what this project is, it's

16:59.365 --> 17:00.747
It has nothing to do with the Chinese.

17:00.767 --> 17:08.278
It's just what happens when you get a cultural revolution and people don't respect what the tradition is.

17:08.939 --> 17:17.651
But just like these blocks, it just made me so sad to see you walk around the park and see things that were priceless.

17:17.691 --> 17:21.416
Who's selling these things for less than five dollars?

17:22.278 --> 17:25.322
How long ago was this?

17:26.382 --> 17:26.783
When was it?

17:26.803 --> 17:28.287
It was a few months ago.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.092
So in this year, 1998?

17:30.112 --> 17:30.433
No, 1997.

17:30.513 --> 17:33.602
1997, you were in Tibet.

17:34.103 --> 17:35.527
I bought one.

17:36.309 --> 17:37.974
I knew what it was from.

17:37.994 --> 17:40.240
I knew what the name it was from.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.495
So what do you feel when you see something like that?

17:42.775 --> 17:56.727
But at least what's happening now is people here, now there's the opportunity to do something.

17:57.196 --> 18:00.259
strike me as a driven person, but are you driven?

18:00.499 --> 18:02.501
No, I'm not driven.

18:02.521 --> 18:12.210
What explains, I mean... Being someplace at the right time, at the right, you know, sometimes you're at the right place at the right moment, you've had the right preparation.

18:12.751 --> 18:17.996
I'm not driven by anybody.

18:19.477 --> 18:24.942
But what is important, I think, is the efforts that are being made, not to extend it,

18:25.546 --> 18:31.875
One of the projects now that the hire has is to go beyond this.

18:34.479 --> 18:49.600
In Qinghai province, in Qinghai and Kanzhou provinces, there were monasteries that survived the Kosovo revolution that the Chinese government said these monasteries will not be destroyed.

18:49.660 --> 18:53.325
These monasteries are chiefly kumbung,

18:54.301 --> 18:55.583
and LeBran.

18:55.703 --> 18:57.065
And so these survived.

18:58.727 --> 19:01.370
And now the blocks, we know that the blocks are there.

19:02.812 --> 19:04.154
So we're able to reprint them.

19:06.076 --> 19:15.328
And we've got some out there that we can't, that have not been wrapped yet.

19:16.730 --> 19:20.455
This is just a small sample.

19:21.156 --> 19:22.097
But these blocks,

19:24.676 --> 19:31.084
have recently been printed from the blocks that survived.

19:31.104 --> 19:31.925
From the actual blocks?

19:32.025 --> 19:32.706
From the actual blocks.

19:32.726 --> 19:33.667
Did you pull from the blocks?

19:33.708 --> 19:33.948
Yes.

19:35.350 --> 19:35.570
Wow.

19:36.371 --> 19:40.957
I thought you'd have done a photocopy or something like that, a photocopy.

19:40.977 --> 19:43.460
No, no, but you see, the blocks are there.

19:44.942 --> 19:45.543
That's wonderful.

19:46.284 --> 19:47.485
And now we're able to get them.

19:49.368 --> 19:52.011
So this is from Khumbum.

19:52.311 --> 19:53.653
That's a print from Khumbum.

19:54.916 --> 19:58.461
The birthplace of Tsongkapa, the founder of the church.

19:58.661 --> 20:00.764
These are all carved by hand into wood blocks?

20:00.784 --> 20:02.406
Yeah, just like the reverse.

20:02.466 --> 20:04.969
So that must be a skill in its own right.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.492
Yeah, you learn not to read.

20:10.396 --> 20:12.358
And it's a skill that's dying out.

20:12.859 --> 20:15.563
It's hard to believe, yeah.

20:16.264 --> 20:22.071
Since that's traditionally been the only way texts have been reproduced, and that's dying out,

20:22.574 --> 20:28.921
Tibetan textual preservation is having to move to completely new media.

20:29.682 --> 20:33.406
The blocks do survive if people make sure they survive.

20:33.426 --> 20:40.615
You have palm leaf manuscripts which look 500 years old, making it be 50 or 60 years old.

20:40.775 --> 20:52.328
What's important about this block printing project is these blocks are kept not only just in Kumbum and Labrang, but it turns out to be a number of monasteries where they have blocks.

20:53.101 --> 21:02.211
If we buy, and if a number of other libraries buy, then there's an incentive for people to say, hey, these are valuable.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.694
You know, it's like having a cow.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.496
We can milk that cow sometimes.

21:07.177 --> 21:22.534
And we can go and say, aha, you know, a number of libraries could buy copies, and this might lead to a, you know, it might provide a fill up to the survival, in some way, of Tibetan

21:22.868 --> 21:25.751
culture, the block printing culture, the book culture.

21:25.771 --> 21:30.416
I really prefer the old block.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.217
They're beautiful.

21:32.718 --> 21:35.281
They're hard to print.

21:35.301 --> 21:37.703
But, you know, you can only do a few of them.

21:38.083 --> 21:42.028
The only way to save the culture is through electronic means.

21:42.048 --> 21:43.749
But still, there has to be side by side.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.592
You understand that and you accept that totally, right?

21:46.832 --> 21:46.953
Right.

21:47.873 --> 21:51.357
Another project that you were missing, one of our

21:51.775 --> 22:02.347
most important members of our staff who've already gone to Bloomington, Pema Boom, who is a specialist on modern Tibetan literature.

22:03.328 --> 22:11.177
Pema is not here today, but he's very interested in what is going on in modern literature.

22:11.397 --> 22:19.707
He's creating a database of all the poetry, the poets, the novelists, the short story writers who are writing in Tibetan.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.391
Most of them are coming out in journals.

22:21.732 --> 22:24.715
They don't come out in... A very few come out in book form.

22:25.155 --> 22:26.096
Where are they writing?

22:26.196 --> 22:26.596
In Tibet?

22:26.617 --> 22:28.058
In Tibetan.

22:28.338 --> 22:30.060
But in Tibet, physically, where are they?

22:30.140 --> 22:30.841
Yes, they're in Tibet.

22:31.281 --> 22:33.884
They produce all of those things over there are journals.

22:35.425 --> 22:40.010
Journals of modern literature, modern culture.

22:41.451 --> 22:48.478
And one of the projects that the hire has is to collect

22:50.197 --> 22:53.121
Cassettes.

22:53.141 --> 22:57.206
This is actually a part.

22:57.226 --> 22:59.809
You can get one of them, but this is the one.

23:00.049 --> 23:02.772
Do you like it strong?

23:03.073 --> 23:03.313
I do.

23:03.553 --> 23:04.675
Good.

23:05.355 --> 23:09.781
That's my preference.

23:09.801 --> 23:13.706
That's fine, Kim.

23:13.986 --> 23:16.129
That's great.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.972
This is the best magazine in Chabash.

23:20.453 --> 23:22.435
It's called Drangchar.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.196
With a barcode, no less.

23:24.216 --> 23:24.757
Yeah.

23:24.777 --> 23:28.821
And what these people are trying to do is recreate.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.346
They're trying to recreate a modern literature in Tibet.

23:36.387 --> 23:43.454
Another great place that things are going on is in cassettes.

23:43.474 --> 23:44.234
And CDs as well.

23:44.395 --> 23:44.655
Yeah.

23:45.956 --> 23:46.416
CDs!

23:47.838 --> 23:49.279
That's amazing.

23:49.580 --> 23:55.466
This kind of thing will mean that, you know, nobody else is collecting them.

23:55.486 --> 23:57.027
Nobody else except B-side except you?

23:57.047 --> 23:58.429
Yeah, right.

23:58.449 --> 23:59.830
Because it's, you know, sort of ephemeral.

23:59.950 --> 24:04.915
Now we have to figure out a way to preserve them, because you can't play those cassettes very often.

24:04.935 --> 24:09.360
These aren't being preserved or saved in Tibet, either, by anyone?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.121
They don't have the means.

24:11.202 --> 24:13.424
So how are you getting them systematically?

24:13.504 --> 24:16.667
Just ask people to provide them for them.

24:16.951 --> 24:18.894
Do you have all this stuff entered?

24:18.914 --> 24:19.915
Do you get it all cataloged?

24:19.935 --> 24:21.077
No, there's no catalog.

24:21.818 --> 24:23.761
Library of Congress doesn't have all this catalog.

24:23.781 --> 24:42.908
I mean, what you'll have if you access Library of Congress or any other university library materials, what they'll have is they'll have, for example, like I said, they'll have one entry that says, you know, collective works, 12 volumes, and that's the sum total of information.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.626
But then you have to know what's inside the human.

24:45.826 --> 24:47.849
And it's useless unless you know what's inside.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.793
So is this something you have to work on?

24:52.114 --> 24:56.058
Well, it's a project that needs to be done.

24:56.098 --> 24:59.342
It's basically called analytical cataloging.

24:59.623 --> 25:08.473
So that somebody can say, oh, yes, I want a biography of this person.

25:09.078 --> 25:10.640
Oh, that's my wife.

25:10.901 --> 25:11.702
I just want to tell her.

25:11.962 --> 25:13.544
She doesn't know where I am.

25:13.624 --> 25:13.825
Hi.

25:16.709 --> 25:22.076
You know, we're in 102.

25:22.096 --> 25:23.959
We're right on the street level.

25:23.999 --> 25:24.720
There are two 102s.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.762
We're on the left.

25:26.983 --> 25:34.393
That's a shame.

25:34.778 --> 25:40.744
Where are you going?

25:41.325 --> 25:43.688
Now?

25:43.748 --> 25:53.158
You better get going if you're going.

25:53.358 --> 25:54.659
Huh?

25:55.020 --> 25:56.441
You better go now.

25:56.481 --> 25:57.763
You won't have time.

25:57.863 --> 25:59.084
You better go.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.266
There's a four.

26:00.346 --> 26:03.469
If you go there, you'll probably catch it with a six.

26:03.668 --> 26:09.676
That would get you in Binghamton by eight.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.926
Four hours?

26:17.086 --> 26:19.910
Well, if you rush, you can... It's four o'clock, wasn't it?

26:19.950 --> 26:20.892
Four o'clock?

26:21.893 --> 26:23.655
Take a taxi and just go.

26:26.259 --> 26:27.100
Coffee's good, Kim.

26:27.140 --> 26:28.001
Thank you.

26:28.021 --> 26:28.562
Okay, okay.

26:29.015 --> 26:30.898
Kim, the coffee's wonderful.

26:31.258 --> 26:33.241
The stronger the better.

26:33.261 --> 26:38.489
Direct from Barcelona.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.050
Yeah, that's wonderful.

26:40.793 --> 26:42.555
What haven't I asked you that's important?

26:42.576 --> 26:43.978
I don't know.

26:44.018 --> 26:44.799
What haven't you asked?

26:44.939 --> 26:46.221
It's important, you know.

26:46.241 --> 26:50.948
That should be the electronic, because I think that's the way of the future.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.512
And you obviously agree with that?

26:53.933 --> 26:54.373
Yeah.

26:54.393 --> 26:55.155
Being the electronic.

26:55.635 --> 26:56.777
And again, is this

26:57.128 --> 26:59.390
getting help from Trace as well?

26:59.550 --> 27:01.092
Is this project?

27:01.512 --> 27:01.672
No, no.

27:01.692 --> 27:03.054
That's a separate project?

27:03.074 --> 27:04.535
Yeah, this is the Trace.

27:04.976 --> 27:08.179
Kim, you might want to say what Trace does and what it doesn't do.

27:08.199 --> 27:09.720
I think you'd give me a little bit, but yeah.

27:09.740 --> 27:12.843
We support projects inside Tibet and China.

27:12.863 --> 27:13.544
I see.

27:13.564 --> 27:20.411
So we're not doing so much support for things in other parts of the world, but once in a while, we support these kinds of things.

27:20.471 --> 27:24.455
But our focus is primarily in support to that community living within the borders of China.

27:24.475 --> 27:27.017
So this, even though this physically is in New York,

27:27.773 --> 27:32.080
It has many visitors from China, for example.

27:32.100 --> 27:32.220
I see.

27:32.240 --> 27:36.587
So, just supporting or encouraging this sort of interchange is something we would be interested in.

27:36.747 --> 27:40.312
And electronic media, it certainly wouldn't want to go about that.

27:40.332 --> 27:40.453
I see.

27:40.473 --> 27:42.876
I'll get in touch with you, and then we can explore this, I think.

27:43.718 --> 27:53.713
Something that I found kind of an anecdote, Paul, when I was in South India at one of the major monasteries down there, Sarah,

27:54.082 --> 28:01.952
ACIP, for example, the Asian Classics Input Project, is based out of one half of Sarah's, the May College of Sarah.

28:01.972 --> 28:10.182
And if you go into their publishing house, it looks like you've walked into a bookstore, and there are Western-format bound books on the shelves, and you can buy them.

28:10.202 --> 28:18.332
And I went in and bought one of all of their books, and I think it cost me maybe about 2,000 rupees, about $60.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.857
I walked down the road to the Jay College

28:23.208 --> 28:38.647
bookstore, and by the time I finally found it, I walked in, and in there was an entire wall of wood blocks, and six monks sit alone in a row with ink rollers and blocks and pages of books drying off of strings hanging from the ceiling.

28:38.867 --> 28:41.650
I have tons of pictures.

28:41.670 --> 28:44.794
And I walked in, and I said, I need to buy a copy of all of your books.

28:45.517 --> 28:46.618
He loved that.

28:46.758 --> 28:54.986
And the Geshe, who was in charge, just sort of clapped his hands, and everyone put down their rollers and their pages, and came over, and he said, okay.

28:55.147 --> 29:00.272
And along the wall was a glass cabinet, and each book was in 20-page sections.

29:00.912 --> 29:03.715
And he sat there and started calling out the names of sections.

29:03.975 --> 29:08.160
It would be brought over, and he would hand them to a monk who would verify that all the pages were correct.

29:08.340 --> 29:11.102
And then, when they were correct, he would say, okay, someone give me this section.

29:11.243 --> 29:12.023
And he would put it together.

29:12.063 --> 29:13.125
Someone give me the next section.

29:13.165 --> 29:14.646
And they sat there, and over the course of

29:14.862 --> 29:19.707
45 minutes built the entire library of textbooks.

29:19.727 --> 29:21.509
Just briefly give me a little bit about your own background.

29:21.529 --> 29:23.551
Did you come in with Gene here?

29:23.752 --> 29:26.555
I actually was at the University of Virginia.

29:26.575 --> 29:31.840
I got a master's in religious studies specializing in Tibetan Buddhism down there.

29:32.581 --> 29:34.644
And my background before that was in computers.

29:35.384 --> 29:40.650
And I've, of course, known about Gene almost since day one, showing up to study that.

29:40.670 --> 29:41.992
Is he a legend in his own time?

29:42.012 --> 29:43.333
He is a legend in his own time.

29:43.988 --> 29:59.973
And about six, seven months ago, some friends of mine brought me up to New York and introduced me to Gene, and I found out what was going on, and I've been coming up here as often as possible as a consultant to help Gene out.

29:59.993 --> 30:06.283
So, what do I need to know about the... You've given me your phone number, which is very important, and... I have my email.

30:06.604 --> 30:10.770
And your email, so we can correspond a little bit.

30:10.790 --> 30:11.211
And...

30:13.300 --> 30:21.132
I think, totally, is it your goal to try and get all of this on?

30:22.354 --> 30:23.015
Yes, one day.

30:23.215 --> 30:27.401
That's my hope, and my hope is to have a... That's not my way.

30:27.421 --> 30:41.923
...have a text, you know, all the text onto electronic readable formats, so that we will have easier sorting and hyperlinking text.

30:42.528 --> 30:43.689
more accessible.

30:44.731 --> 30:46.052
And how are you being supported?

30:46.432 --> 30:48.315
How are you getting your funding?

30:48.375 --> 30:50.377
We're doing small fundraisings here and there.

30:52.079 --> 31:01.990
It's very difficult in general because everyone is voluntary basis, so we don't have anyone who is fully dedicated to working in fundraising.

31:02.291 --> 31:04.994
And so what kind of space do you operate out of?

31:05.014 --> 31:07.877
Is it university space or...?

31:08.043 --> 31:12.209
No, we're right now having a small space at Margaret's Apartments.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.413
You know, we have a small office there.

31:15.433 --> 31:23.024
And our main project, input project, is going on in Nepal, in Tibetan refugee settlement areas.

31:23.725 --> 31:26.489
So we did a lot of text input there by Tibetan people.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.632
So what was the impetus for this?

31:28.672 --> 31:30.595
Is this something that you generated?

31:30.615 --> 31:30.895
No, no, no.

31:30.936 --> 31:33.038
This is something Arumaj generated.

31:33.059 --> 31:33.379
Yes.

31:33.900 --> 31:37.645
So tell me about the spark, the light that went on over your head.

31:38.131 --> 31:38.672
determined?

31:38.692 --> 31:41.175
Did you look out and say, computers, maybe this is the way to do this?

31:41.476 --> 31:48.085
Give me a little bit of thought that went into the... Yeah, I came here in the 80s, you know.

31:48.105 --> 31:50.148
To here being, to the United States.

31:50.168 --> 31:51.009
To the United States.

31:51.069 --> 31:51.490
Okay.

31:51.510 --> 31:57.358
And then I've been exposed to different computer technology and, you know, my friends like Marty and other people.

31:58.219 --> 32:02.485
So you got involved in this through friendship, basically.

32:02.735 --> 32:03.596
That was a question.

32:03.616 --> 32:06.059
How did a lawyer get involved in this?

32:06.079 --> 32:09.283
Why don't you tell them something about you and Lynn?

32:09.303 --> 32:11.426
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:11.446 --> 32:12.447
They're both volunteers.

32:13.749 --> 32:14.129
Lynn works.

32:14.169 --> 32:14.710
What does she do?

32:14.730 --> 32:20.737
She's basically a... Now, she's talking to Marty, and we're talking about Marty and Lynn.

32:20.998 --> 32:23.721
Yeah, that's... Lynn is my wife.

32:23.741 --> 32:24.021
Okay.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.304
You know, we were... I can transcribe these things, don't I?

32:26.384 --> 32:30.109
It's a whole madness.

32:30.359 --> 32:49.159
I'm just, you know, typically I studied philosophy in college and Bob Thurman was a professor where I went to college and I started studying Tibetan philosophy.

32:49.179 --> 32:51.161
Became involved eventually in Buddhism.

32:52.282 --> 32:54.304
Became a professional attorney.

32:54.384 --> 32:56.306
My wife actually met Rinpoche.

32:56.326 --> 32:58.268
She was also involved in Buddhism.

32:58.348 --> 32:59.269
My wife met him.

32:59.671 --> 33:15.696
And as we got to know him and got to understand what's needed for preserving the whole Tibetan culture and educational system, we began to work together and under Rinpoche's leadership developed these different projects.

33:15.776 --> 33:28.395
And I, you know, my firm and I incorporated Natartha International Nonprofit Educational Corporation, which is actually a collection society in the educational system in New York.

33:28.763 --> 33:45.125
And our goal is to, you know, collect Asian texts generally, but specific types of Tibetan texts that we're mainly focusing on now and to generally preserve Tibetan educational and cultural literature.

33:48.270 --> 33:52.155
And also our primary goal was not only to

33:52.473 --> 33:57.621
input text into computers, but also to help preserve any Tibetan rock.

33:58.182 --> 34:00.466
Give me a little bit of your own background prior to this.

34:00.827 --> 34:05.755
I was born in Tibetan refugee settlement in northern India.

34:05.855 --> 34:07.497
You were born in a settlement?

34:07.517 --> 34:07.898
Yes.

34:08.619 --> 34:09.481
And that was what year?

34:10.342 --> 34:13.367
1965, as they told me.

34:13.387 --> 34:15.470
I don't remember.

34:15.490 --> 34:18.455
But he was born after the people.

34:18.656 --> 34:19.577
That's very important.

34:19.793 --> 34:42.727
Yeah, and I grew up in the settlement in a very small village in northeast India, Sikkim, and received my monastic training and education at the Nalanda Institute, which was affiliated to Saskia University in India.

34:42.747 --> 34:46.813
So I did the Masters under the Saskia University in Sikkim.

34:47.350 --> 34:50.575
So you're born in a Tibetan community outside of Tibet.

34:50.875 --> 34:51.536
Yes.

34:51.977 --> 35:01.290
What was it that drove you to work so closely in preserving Tibetan culture?

35:01.470 --> 35:04.315
And what was it?

35:04.355 --> 35:08.180
I mean, clearly your family must have passed on a good deal.

35:08.320 --> 35:12.426
We're talking about the disappearing ramas and all these others.

35:12.446 --> 35:14.269
But certainly there was something here that was passed on

35:14.468 --> 35:21.054
Chimi, why don't you explain who Dzogchenpello Vrimoje is, and what his relationship to Karmapa was.

35:21.094 --> 35:23.896
Am I missing something?

35:23.916 --> 35:24.837
I must be missing.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.078
Another light goes out of my head.

35:26.979 --> 35:36.347
Well, I think, of course, it's due to his father and mother, but also his previous reincarnations.

35:36.367 --> 35:41.051
And his previous reincarnation from Dzogchenpello in Tibet is very, very, very important Lama.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.193
And also his own

35:43.747 --> 36:01.548
a teacher in Sikkim called Hisolamiskama, and he took care of him, he brought him up, he said, here, like you're my son, I'm like father, your duties in the future is to preserve our lineage, our culture, that's how he came in.

36:01.568 --> 36:12.741
Then, of course, his teacher sort of passed away, but he's most eminent among the young generations, and then also he said,

36:12.957 --> 36:22.048
Most young generation people, of course, they're all interested in their own world and government and anything like that, but he was sort of started this kind of preservation into other things.

36:22.708 --> 36:31.859
So therefore, one, due to his previous Vinkara Lama, so therefore his duty to perform according to his previous Vinkara Lama.

36:32.540 --> 36:38.847
Two, he was brought up by the Hisodans, the Yawakarmapa, who take care of him like sons, say, father and son, you must do.

36:39.282 --> 36:40.544
what I inherited is.

36:41.065 --> 36:51.400
And thirdly, then his own motivations, he feels very, very strongly to dedicate it to this culture, in spite of even he was born outside Tibet.

36:51.900 --> 36:56.447
But his holy dharma, but he brought up in a very atmosphere of Tibet.

36:57.288 --> 37:06.842
Any influence, when we... In our monastery, I was so speechless, you have to eat food like in Tibet.

37:07.042 --> 37:10.667
Many people said, it's crazy what he's doing in this monastery.

37:10.828 --> 37:15.996
He said, no, no, no, they have to carry a little thunder in the back into the monastery.

37:16.116 --> 37:20.903
In India, they all have to carry shoes, they have to wear in the back.

37:20.923 --> 37:22.385
He's sort of strictly brought up.

37:22.405 --> 37:24.949
I think that is what he got into his head.

37:25.165 --> 37:27.168
Well, you've explained it.

37:28.289 --> 37:33.956
I've met all of you today for the first time, so I'm totally ignorant of... No, no, no, it's a different culture.

37:34.096 --> 37:38.101
Absolutely, if I'm talking about previous lives, you'd think it might be the man who's joking.

37:38.121 --> 37:42.287
His interest in this is more than casual, shall we say.

37:42.367 --> 37:43.909
Yeah, absolutely.

37:43.989 --> 37:48.875
Actually, that's a wonderful... You'll be able to help me a little bit on this if I follow.

37:48.975 --> 37:49.616
Sure.

37:49.636 --> 37:52.680
Because this is, I think, very important.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.362
Very, very important.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.975
I think this is a pretty good thank you.

37:58.075 --> 37:58.636
Thank you very much.

37:58.656 --> 37:59.737
And I'll be in touch.

37:59.777 --> 38:00.437
Thank you so much.

38:00.497 --> 38:03.640
And I'll be in touch.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.583
Yeah, that's the object inside the connections.

38:07.603 --> 38:09.104
So there, you have connections.

38:10.966 --> 38:17.852
Is he still at the British Library?

38:17.932 --> 38:19.393
You retired, what, three years ago?

38:19.653 --> 38:20.734
Yeah.

38:20.754 --> 38:25.378
Now he's devoting himself to his practice and writing.

38:25.595 --> 38:30.287
practice of Buddhism, and based in London.

38:30.668 --> 38:39.050
So you're here for this conference in Bloomington, is that right?

38:39.070 --> 38:42.118
I really came here at a most...

38:42.402 --> 38:43.864
Proficious time, didn't I?

38:43.884 --> 38:49.232
I mean, this is... No, no, by some power higher than me.

38:49.893 --> 38:51.236
Meeting with the Lamas of May.

38:51.276 --> 38:52.457
That's right.

38:53.279 --> 38:55.101
Are you going to the conference in Bloomington?

38:55.121 --> 38:56.744
Yes, we're going on Saturday.

38:56.984 --> 38:59.328
And what is the rubric?

38:59.348 --> 39:00.390
What is the name of the conference?

39:00.410 --> 39:03.254
It's the International Association of Tibetan Studies.

39:03.274 --> 39:08.562
It holds the conference every three years, and it will be this year, we will have people from...

39:09.200 --> 39:19.051
Western scholars, Tibetans from Tibet, Chinese from Tibet, and Tibetans from the Diaspora.

39:19.071 --> 39:20.632
A few, right?

39:20.653 --> 39:20.733
Yes.

39:20.753 --> 39:22.094
Who else is coming from Dharamsala?

39:23.295 --> 39:24.337
Just me and Lofsang.

39:25.298 --> 39:25.978
Lofsang Shastri?

39:26.058 --> 39:27.240
Yes, Rapsal is coming.

39:27.260 --> 39:27.640
Rapsal.

39:29.823 --> 39:36.550
But it's a place for them to meet, and, you know, in the future it'll be a different kind of Tibetan studies.

39:36.570 --> 39:36.990
Yeah, yeah.

39:37.010 --> 39:38.532
It'll be largely dominated by

39:39.085 --> 39:40.587
by Tibetans who have the training.

39:43.330 --> 39:48.256
Let me ask you, are you hopeful?

39:48.856 --> 39:49.697
Are you optimistic?

39:50.018 --> 39:51.419
Oh, more than optimistic.

39:51.439 --> 39:53.822
In Buddhism we never think about hope.

39:53.882 --> 39:55.564
Hope means a little doubt.

39:56.165 --> 40:03.053
We don't talk about hope because hope implies a little bit of a doubt and there's no doubt.

40:03.333 --> 40:03.914
There's no doubt.

40:03.994 --> 40:04.755
That's wonderful.

40:05.140 --> 40:08.729
I see it in type right now.

40:09.491 --> 40:10.053
That's wonderful.

40:10.955 --> 40:11.597
That's great.

40:12.780 --> 40:13.080
Thank you.

40:13.301 --> 40:21.883
Thank you very much.
