WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:28.553
this way

00:28.853 --> 00:30.355
I'll wait a minute.

00:33.098 --> 00:33.879
Okay, good afternoon.

00:34.079 --> 00:48.977
I want to thank everybody here for coming, especially Colonel Sowers, 2 staff at 3rd COSCOM, Colonel Mark Hampton, the commander of the 35th ASG, Mr. Nick Basbates, who is here from Boston, on assignment to cover the library opening for the LA Times.

00:48.997 --> 00:57.207
And today what we're going to do is we're going to dedicate this library, or the beginnings of a library,

00:57.524 --> 01:07.998
that we've been building over the last couple of months in order to offer an opportunity for soldiers to get books, and ultimately as an opportunity to get books into the hands of Iraqis.

01:09.019 --> 01:21.996
And what I'd like to do first is that that's something I want to read, which in The Mayhem, I said what I thought I wanted to read.

01:22.497 --> 01:24.159
What did you put in there?

01:24.760 --> 01:26.502
Oh, I thought it was right there.

01:27.190 --> 01:31.736
What I'll do is, I think I can probably tell this anecdote actually from memory.

01:32.277 --> 01:41.350
When I got here to Iraq, I hadn't been here very long, and Colonel Sowers made a comment when I went to a staff call, and she said, you always have a book in your hand.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.431
And this is true.

01:42.511 --> 01:43.473
I'm a bit of a book nut.

01:44.374 --> 01:46.938
And the book was Imperial Grunts by Robert Capel.

01:47.619 --> 01:53.687
And what he talked about in his story, it's a great book about the modern American army, everything we're doing.

01:54.325 --> 01:57.088
And he's telling a little anecdote about special forces.

01:57.128 --> 02:00.592
And they're out at some god-awful remote outpost in Afghanistan.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.715
And the soldiers are sitting around.

02:02.755 --> 02:04.497
And they don't have internet.

02:04.577 --> 02:05.698
And they don't have television.

02:05.958 --> 02:06.859
They don't have radio.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.482
But they had a book.

02:09.502 --> 02:21.396
And they were reading aloud to each other, Lonesome Duck by Larry McMurtry, which I think is an incredible testament to what books can do for soldiers, for all of us.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.960
In 1990 and 91, I was in the Gulf War.

02:25.320 --> 02:31.386
And it just so happens that one of the books that I had sent to me then was the book Blows and Dove by Larry McMurtry.

02:31.406 --> 02:32.207
And that's where I read it.

02:32.227 --> 02:33.248
I read it in the desert.

02:33.268 --> 02:34.549
And so I've always associated.

02:34.970 --> 02:41.175
And when I read that anecdote by Mr. Kaplan just here a couple of months ago, I thought, I mean, that's perfect.

02:41.196 --> 02:42.837
That's exactly what I think we're all about.

02:42.877 --> 02:51.045
So with that as kind of an introduction, what I'd like to do first is introduce you to Mr. Nicholas Bazbaines.

02:51.295 --> 02:53.698
was a public affairs officer in the Navy.

02:53.878 --> 02:55.760
But I hope you don't hold that against him.

02:56.681 --> 02:59.344
The fact that he was in the Navy and the fact that he was a public affairs officer.

03:00.005 --> 03:15.223
And in the process of trying to figure out how to build a library here on the lot in a place where soldiers get books, I went out on the internet and I sent out 1,000 questions to everybody I could think of that could help me figure out how to do this, because I don't have any training as a librarian.

03:15.944 --> 03:17.385
And I had read some of his books.

03:17.506 --> 03:19.648
In fact, I'd read all his books except for two.

03:20.253 --> 03:26.321
And I know that if anybody knows about books and could help me answer some technical questions, he was probably the guy.

03:27.203 --> 03:37.136
And better than my law of streams, he not only answered the email, after a couple of exchanges, he said, why don't I come to Iraq and take a look at your library, and I can talk to you about it.

03:37.196 --> 03:38.538
And he has other interests in Iraq.

03:38.799 --> 03:41.182
He's never gotten to come here, and I don't want to steal the thunder.

03:42.003 --> 03:44.607
But I thought that'd be pretty cool if we could work that out.

03:44.727 --> 03:48.572
And he gave me quite a bit of good technical guidance on kind of how to get this thing off the ground.

03:49.058 --> 03:51.682
So I'm really extremely appreciative to have him here today.

03:52.183 --> 04:02.838
And I'll also note that behind him on the table here, he has provided two copies of books, and he's mailing us additional ones that are donator copies for this library dedicated to us here.

04:03.259 --> 04:12.192
There are also three other books by Dr. Anna Rosemus, who is in Passau Germany right now with the veterans who donated all the books that are in this library.

04:12.933 --> 04:18.762
And the last thing I'll say before Nick comes up is this is one-third of the books that we know are already on the way here.

04:19.163 --> 04:20.585
We have a lot of books coming.

04:20.605 --> 04:23.169
This is about 3,000 books in these three rooms.

04:24.171 --> 04:27.135
And we have at least 6,000 more books already coming.

04:27.716 --> 04:32.023
And there's probably going to be a point where we've got to say too much is not necessarily good.

04:32.504 --> 04:33.846
So Nick, if I can ask you to come up.

04:38.754 --> 04:41.238
Thank you, Brian, for the wonderful introduction.

04:41.258 --> 04:47.247
And thank you for inviting me to come to Iraq and to be with you and to celebrate this.

04:47.783 --> 04:49.346
just magnificent occasion.

04:49.566 --> 04:56.138
I think probably the greatest surprise is when I accepted the invitation to travel 6,000 miles and come here.

04:56.158 --> 05:12.947
Well, I'm a sucker for a great story and for a great book story and a great news story, and this to me is just an extraordinary opportunity for me to come and do what I've written so far, five books about, which is celebrations of books, book people, book culture, libraries,

05:13.484 --> 05:15.326
And I've never really been at the founding.

05:15.827 --> 05:17.488
I've written about bibliomaniacs.

05:17.588 --> 05:27.820
I wrote a book called The Gentle Madness, which is over there, which is about 2,500 years of people who are obsessed with getting books and in the process preserving our culture.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.823
Brian mentioned that I had never been here before.

05:31.604 --> 05:37.230
In my book, Patience and Fortitude, which is the second book I wrote in which I will mail to you, I couldn't really schlep all these five

05:37.582 --> 05:46.373
these books that weigh about 12 pounds, and my baggage, it was just too heavy, but I promised that I will, the first thing I do when I get home is to mail the others.

05:46.413 --> 05:52.460
But the book, Patience and Fortitude, no, I always have to assure people, it's not a lost Jane Austen novel.

05:52.480 --> 05:59.008
But once I was introduced as Nick Basbanes, the author of A Gentle Madness and Pride and Prejudice, so I said, no, no, no.

05:59.028 --> 06:07.318
It's Patience and Fortitude, which are the names, the unofficial names of the lions that stand guard in front of the New York Public Library in Manhattan.

06:07.585 --> 06:24.066
so named during the years of the Great Depression, when Mayor Fiorello La Guardia would give a Sunday night address, and what he said, and I think the metaphor even applies to what we're going through over here, you soldiers and all of us who support you back home, and believe me, there are millions of us.

06:24.927 --> 06:37.322
What he would say is, unfailingly, he would always terminate his remarks by saying, what we need to see us through the great ordeal which lay ahead are to exercise the twin virtues of patience and fortitude,

06:37.943 --> 06:45.934
And so almost automatically those names became applied to these lions that stood guard at Sandgard in front of the New York Public Library.

06:45.954 --> 06:55.828
And I thought, what a wonderful image, what a wonderful metaphor for a book about an institution which some people think has a very indefinite future.

06:55.868 --> 06:59.454
What is the role of the library of the 21st century when you have the computer?

07:00.275 --> 07:01.476
Does the book have a future?

07:01.496 --> 07:02.678
Well, I certainly think so.

07:02.738 --> 07:04.761
Colonel McNerney thinks so.

07:05.078 --> 07:08.762
We have three colonels with us here today who undoubtedly also think so.

07:08.842 --> 07:10.403
The troops think so.

07:10.443 --> 07:13.606
I'll just conclude my remarks by saying two things.

07:13.626 --> 07:18.171
When I was writing that book, Patience and Fortitude, I whined in print.

07:18.251 --> 07:23.736
I mean, I don't like to be a whiner, but I just bemoaned the fact that here I was in Turkey.

07:23.836 --> 07:32.925
I was visiting one of the sites of one of the great ancient libraries of Pergamum, which was the rival libraries of Alexandria, 300.

07:33.260 --> 07:47.436
I said, here I am at Pergamum, the site of this ancient library, mindful of the fact that just one border away in Iraq is the mother of all libraries at Ashurbanipal Palace Library, which is Nineveh.

07:47.876 --> 07:59.149
Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to visit Nineveh during this trip, but I will be able to visit Ur tomorrow, so I'm promised, and hopefully that will take place.

07:59.483 --> 08:00.224
was invented.

08:00.364 --> 08:06.672
It isn't part of the world where writing was invented, where the world's first known library was established.

08:06.692 --> 08:16.224
And here we are at this really very tenuous time in our history where we are trying to reach out to the people of Iraq through books, through a library.

08:16.725 --> 08:18.387
That to me just resonates so much.

08:18.407 --> 08:21.711
And when I understood that this is what you were doing here, I felt I had to come

08:22.096 --> 08:24.679
And I'm so proud to be able to be a part of it.

08:24.799 --> 08:30.524
I'll just conclude by quoting one remark by a Scottish historian by the name of John Hill Breton.

08:30.564 --> 08:31.666
He was writing in the 1850s.

08:33.007 --> 08:34.328
And he was writing about libraries.

08:34.368 --> 08:37.612
And he said, a library cannot be constructed.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.033
It is the growth of ages.

08:39.493 --> 08:46.520
So when you look around and you see 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 books, no, it's not Harvard, and it's 15 million volumes.

08:47.381 --> 08:50.044
And it's not the Library of Congress, and it's 30 million volumes.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.429
But it's the lie that it's 3,000 on day one.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.873
And I know Harvard never started with 3,000.

08:56.033 --> 08:59.219
They started with 268 in 1638.

08:59.259 --> 09:01.422
So we've got a long way to go here, but you'll get there.

09:01.843 --> 09:05.229
And I certainly congratulate you on this remarkable occasion.

09:05.269 --> 09:16.368
And I thank you again for inviting me to be here with you.

09:16.388 --> 09:16.588
Thank you.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.763
Okay, now I would like, thank you, Nick.

09:19.943 --> 09:20.604
Thank you very much.

09:22.025 --> 09:24.107
I now would like to introduce Colonel Hansen.

09:24.307 --> 09:27.610
Before I do so, never mind, I'm sorry.

09:28.210 --> 09:40.321
What I would like to do is introduce Colonel Hansen, and I think it's important to note, we would not have a place to put books if it weren't through the help of Major Chris Jackson, who works for Colonel Hansen.

09:40.341 --> 09:43.083
Chris is not here because he's on R&R, much deserved.

09:43.543 --> 09:46.626
But I personally want to express the thanks that

09:46.842 --> 09:57.357
I feel toward members of your staff, sir, toward Brenda Taylor back working here in the back, Chris, all the folks here at Sergeant Edward in the library have really helped.

09:57.377 --> 10:05.329
And not to mention, we have a book of photographs that we printed out some photos to show what this room looked like a month ago.

10:05.770 --> 10:08.854
And you wouldn't believe this, but I can tell you, there were no bookshops.

10:08.874 --> 10:15.043
And that also is because of Colonel Hampson's folks that we were able to find a place to put

10:15.496 --> 10:16.337
these books to serve.

10:16.437 --> 10:17.719
I can ask you to come up now.

10:18.781 --> 10:19.101
Thank you.

10:19.301 --> 10:19.562
If you were.

10:21.124 --> 10:21.524
Thank you very much.

10:21.544 --> 10:23.227
I want to thank everyone for being here today.

10:23.667 --> 10:33.942
We at LSA Anaconda, as you well know now, are the fortunate recipients of this huge book collecting donation.

10:33.962 --> 10:44.997
I mean, this was a collection of books, mainly for one part of the United States, I would say, or at least they all collected there before being sent here, and that's Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

10:45.415 --> 10:58.010
There are a lot of hundreds, and thousands probably, veterans who have contributed and made this day possible with the first 3,000 books that are here, and again another 6,000 or 7,000 on the way.

10:59.412 --> 11:03.096
I'd like to kind of connect the dots for the history behind today.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.920
It stretches back into history.

11:06.401 --> 11:09.444
But I'm going to start with Colonel McNerney.

11:09.464 --> 11:15.051
Last year, he had the chance to attend the 61th anniversary of the end of World War II.

11:15.672 --> 11:27.712
The veterans that attended that were many, and he had a chance to talk to a lot of those veterans, and one of those veterans was a Mr. Bob Patton.

11:27.732 --> 11:36.727
He was a member of the 65th Infantry Division, part of Patton's Third Army, and learned a little bit in talking to many of the veterans.

11:36.747 --> 11:40.093
He learned that right after World War II,

11:40.563 --> 11:43.727
The GIs noticed a big void in Germany.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.952
Remember how Hitler had burned so many of the books and all the literature.

11:48.673 --> 11:49.875
And it was the U.S.

11:49.895 --> 11:57.524
GIs that started, as veterans, that started a collection of new literature to share with the Germans.

11:57.544 --> 12:04.473
And that culminated with the opening of the Bucherei Europa, or the Europe Library.

12:05.214 --> 12:06.435
It's still there today.

12:06.972 --> 12:11.196
So that's a piece of history, and we are really a follow-on of that history.

12:11.937 --> 12:20.386
While Lieutenant Colonel McNerney was at that anniversary, there was a need popped up, and that was the void of books here in Iraq.

12:21.007 --> 12:33.800
And so it was the veterans that attended that anniversary that had gone back to the United States, and over that period of time, less than a year, put together all these books and sent them our way.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.562
That's remarkable right there.

12:35.812 --> 12:38.936
And a lot of people back home are a part of that.

12:39.437 --> 12:44.184
So starting with the hundreds and thousands of veterans that did the contributions, number one.

12:44.584 --> 12:53.237
But back there in North Carolina, you have a Boy Scout troop, Troop 39, who volunteered many, many hours in pulling all that together.

12:53.377 --> 13:01.148
You've got the Veteran of Foreign Wars there in the town or in the city, as well as the local American Legion.

13:01.168 --> 13:04.232
And together, they all made this happen to send the first

13:08.228 --> 13:09.990
I'd like to close, though, by saying one thing.

13:10.010 --> 13:15.234
There are probably three things that we can take out of this as soldiers, and that is, number one, generosity.

13:16.735 --> 13:20.459
It's always great to help a fellow soldier as well as a fellow American.

13:21.379 --> 13:22.921
Number two, the Boy Scouts.

13:23.061 --> 13:24.682
They got a lot out of this.

13:25.143 --> 13:35.031
That in terms of volunteering, in terms of good citizenship, and also the old do a good turn daily type of motto.

13:35.592 --> 13:38.134
But third is for us as Americans.

13:38.536 --> 13:45.242
and more especially as veterans or veterans to be as soon as we finish this particular rotation.

13:45.843 --> 13:54.631
Think of the history, 61 years after World War II, and you have veterans of World War II still giving.

13:54.651 --> 14:04.280
And so I hope that we all as soldiers and veterans have at least 50 to 60, maybe even 70 more years left in us to give back.

14:06.082 --> 14:06.282
Thank you.

14:11.864 --> 14:15.629
I should add that Mr. Bayes Bayes will meet here in a couple of days.

14:15.669 --> 14:17.191
He will be going to Passau, Germany.

14:17.772 --> 14:26.183
Those same veterans that I met last year who are incredible people, he will meet them at the Europa Library there in Passau.

14:26.704 --> 14:40.302
One other thing I'd like to add about that real quickly is part of what made such an impact on me last year when I talked to these guys, the last day of the Public Affairs Coverage Commission of that veteran's visit, these men that had liberated

14:40.990 --> 14:51.146
Southeast Germany, went to concentration camps of Mauthausen and Guntherkirchen, places that Jewish and other people, the Nazis, had targeted.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.550
And these men liberated those camps.

14:53.570 --> 14:58.738
And they told their own testimonies and have pictures and have expressed the history of what they did.

14:59.239 --> 15:08.213
Last year, they reenacted the liberation of Mauthausen, walked back up the road in their uniform for World War II, opened the gates, and there inside the gate,

15:08.783 --> 15:12.147
were some of the people that they had liberated 61 years ago.

15:12.307 --> 15:13.288
Absolutely incredible.

15:14.790 --> 15:20.096
Public Affairs guys like to talk about good stories, but you can't put a value on that.

15:20.897 --> 15:24.701
But lastly, I would like to introduce my boss, Colonel Sowers.

15:25.623 --> 15:28.706
And I will tell you, she's chief staff of the third COSCOM.

15:29.467 --> 15:33.812
I would tell you that we can't do things like this without the support of the chain of command.

15:34.298 --> 15:40.304
And I can't tell you how supportive the chain of command here is for this kind of project and everything like this.

15:40.945 --> 15:47.992
She talks quite often about the importance of these outreach missions, the missions that the civil affairs teams do.

15:48.673 --> 15:58.363
And all along these last couple months while I was kind of involved on this as a side mission, I kept trying to find a way to intelligently describe what we were doing, and I really didn't do a very good job of it.

15:58.763 --> 16:03.748
It was hard for me to explain what this had to do with public affairs in COSCOM.

16:04.066 --> 16:09.212
Hopefully that is clear today and going forth, because there's a lot more books.

16:09.692 --> 16:18.142
What I'd like to do is introduce Colonel Sowers to also finish off the formal talking of this event, and we have some things to give out.

16:18.162 --> 16:18.282
Ma'am?

16:18.302 --> 16:18.503
Thank you.

16:18.643 --> 16:23.488
I tell you, it's neat to be a part of this kind of circle of giving.

16:23.648 --> 16:33.820
I mean, as you describe how it all kind of comes around, it's neat to be here and to be a part of the dedication of the Halbert and Red Circle Memorial Library.

16:34.323 --> 16:36.005
And thank you all for coming.

16:37.426 --> 16:44.973
You know, I would like to just talk about the fact that the books that have been donated here are really for two purposes.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.094
It's got a dual-fold purpose.

16:47.635 --> 16:57.684
And I don't know if you all are familiar with one of the singers that I've been familiar with for a long time, Amy Grant, and one of her older songs is Doubly Good.

16:58.224 --> 17:00.406
And I think that's what kind of is happening here.

17:00.426 --> 17:02.288
We have a doubly good event.

17:02.555 --> 17:16.110
Not only are these books being donated by veterans to soldiers who can benefit from them, but eventually these books are going to be given to the Iraqis in a couple of years, specifically to the folks in Balad.

17:16.831 --> 17:23.018
And all that's in them and the world of ideas that's in them will be given to the Iraqis.

17:23.878 --> 17:31.667
And it will be sort of that continuing cycle of giving and of growing that we've been talking about today.

17:32.693 --> 17:43.068
You know, here I am preaching to the choir because the books that are here really do appreciate books and really do understand why this is an important event.

17:43.729 --> 17:50.338
But I guess if I could summarize it in a small way, I would say for the soldiers that are going to benefit from it first.

17:51.700 --> 17:57.008
You know, I kind of look at life as sort of a spectrum of things.

17:57.028 --> 18:00.793
Like sometimes we're in the execution phase of our lives.

18:01.094 --> 18:08.144
where things that we've done in the past and experiences that we've had all kind of come together and we're able to execute and make something happen.

18:08.164 --> 18:12.170
And we were there and prepared at just the right time to use those skills.

18:12.190 --> 18:16.436
And I think many of us here in Iraq feel like this is the time.

18:17.037 --> 18:21.403
You know, that I've had this job and this job and this job and it has perfectly prepared me to execute.

18:22.144 --> 18:26.770
And sometimes in our lives, I feel like we're in preparation phase.

18:27.612 --> 18:30.696
And sometimes we don't understand why we have

18:30.946 --> 18:58.860
certain tasks or jobs that we have but we see them later on that they really were important to what we needed to do and I think these books sort of will make that wholeness connection for soldiers because they soldiers here really are in the execution phase they really are putting all the skills together and making things happen whether you're on staff or you're out there on the roads they are doing that but this will provide them

18:59.144 --> 19:27.700
maybe a preparation stage at the same time they will have a portion of their life where they can come in here and find books that mean something to them and they can explore their interests or they can find interests that they didn't even know they had and the way they're kind of arranged even initially i mean you can go kind of right to where things draw you you know there's reference in there there's mysteries in there here's military history um you know there's some some religious

19:28.355 --> 19:57.383
books over here and so whatever is kind of motivating you I mean it's available and it's a whole world of ideas and it's all you know I'm reading a book right now about imagery and meditation prayer and if I didn't have those ideas from someone else to put them down in the book I would never be able to experience that until I'm able to go after something that is important to me at the same time that I'm doing this other important job

19:57.768 --> 20:08.924
So I am thrilled about the opportunity that these books will provide for so many of our soldiers, you know, just to open their minds and think about how incredible the capacity of our minds are.

20:08.945 --> 20:11.829
They say that Einstein only used like 12 to 14 percent of his brain.

20:12.430 --> 20:17.717
And this is mental fitness right in this room that's available to folks.

20:18.419 --> 20:19.781
And so that's kind of neat.

20:19.801 --> 20:27.572
And I think the other piece, that secondary piece, when we do donate these to the Iraqis, is that this is a gift from America to them.

20:28.008 --> 20:31.794
And this is something that's freedom.

20:32.095 --> 20:36.742
I mean, and you can choose from any book that you want, and it doesn't have the Al Jazeera flavor on it.

20:37.123 --> 20:43.232
I mean, these are ideas from good to bad to right to wrong to what, you know, this is the world right in here.

20:43.914 --> 20:50.404
And there's some Iraqis out there, and there's some soldiers out there that these books will change their lives.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.202
Because they'll read about somebody who really motivates them.

20:53.683 --> 20:56.526
And they'll be inspired to do things that they never would have done.

20:57.286 --> 20:59.989
So this is kind of an important event that's happening here.

21:00.469 --> 21:01.751
And it's neat to be a part of it.

21:02.051 --> 21:07.256
And there's a lot of people that we owe a lot of gratitude to.

21:08.577 --> 21:13.202
And you all have covered quite a few of them.

21:13.222 --> 21:15.444
Do we have a couple of plaques that we want to offer?

21:15.464 --> 21:17.826
If I can have Special Spurkson come forward.

21:18.852 --> 21:21.876
And we're going to have you stand to the left of the Chief.

21:22.496 --> 21:24.799
We have two plaques.

21:24.819 --> 21:29.805
First, this is going to hand you first.

21:30.366 --> 21:32.028
The Boy Scouts Troop-39.

21:32.048 --> 21:32.408
All right.

21:32.809 --> 21:34.851
Well, here is the Boy Scouts Troop-39.

21:35.412 --> 21:44.202
And I know the Troop Master, his name, let me try and say, Jim Mackerel.

21:44.317 --> 21:57.171
Jim Mackerel, he's a scoutmaster and he's got those scouts at Chapel Hill to do a whole bunch of boxing up and to making this, kind of taking the books and making it executable.

21:58.532 --> 22:12.788
And Specialist Mary Ferguson went back even during the R&R leave to help these folks not only talk to the veterans, but to kind of just assure them of what the purpose was and where all these folks were going for.

22:13.426 --> 22:18.374
First of all, I'd like to at least present this to you on behalf of the World Scout.

22:18.394 --> 22:25.345
And then we have one more that we'd like to present to you.

22:25.746 --> 22:26.267
Thank you.

22:26.287 --> 22:26.768
Okay.

22:26.788 --> 22:28.490
And this one is for Robert Patton.

22:28.511 --> 22:29.492
Okay.

22:29.512 --> 22:39.889
And the 52th Infantry Division, and soon to be followed on by the 71st Infantry Division, but this one's specifically for them.

22:40.122 --> 22:49.076
Robert Patton used to be the president of their association and really has been the powerhouse behind getting this initiative put together.

22:49.637 --> 23:04.760
And so to him and to all his veterans, thank you very much and I appreciate you accepting us in your honor.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.665
The last thing we're going to do to wrap this up is I have a box.

23:08.422 --> 23:15.748
I'm going to ask Colonel Janet Jackson, Jeanette Jackson, I'm sorry, come forward.

23:15.808 --> 23:23.855
And if you didn't get to come to the University of Texas Banner, this is your opportunity to see this book make a long time.

23:23.895 --> 23:32.863
And I actually asked her if she would help wrap up the ceremony, because in the other room, and after we're done, I'm going to explain how the library is organized informally.

23:32.903 --> 23:37.787
But if you go out these doors where a lot of you came in, you'll find probably 100 boxes.

23:38.442 --> 23:39.323
on the shelf.

23:39.823 --> 23:42.565
Those boxes are all full of books, like this.

23:43.867 --> 23:51.853
And what's going to happen with those boxes, those are paperbacks, is we're going to have convoys from units like Colonel Jackson's command.

23:52.374 --> 23:58.419
She sends convoys out, those units from our posts, and they go out to the fobs that are distant.

23:58.439 --> 24:02.402
Because we have a library here, soldiers come here and check out these books, sign them out.

24:03.083 --> 24:08.247
These books are for keeping, and because for those soldiers that can't come here, that are remote stations,

24:08.547 --> 24:12.511
We're going to send the books out to them and hopefully throw three or four boxes with these convoys.

24:12.931 --> 24:15.514
And wherever those trucks go, the books will go with them.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.656
And that's part of our gift to those soldiers.

24:17.676 --> 24:20.899
So ma'am, I'm giving that to you on behalf of the soldiers.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.200
Thank you very much.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.822
I just want to say a couple of things.

24:25.463 --> 24:29.447
And I said this to Nick and to the other commanders that were in the ring.

24:30.588 --> 24:32.730
My first job was in a library.

24:33.470 --> 24:36.193
And I was the oldest of eight kids.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.335
And this is my way of escaping.

24:38.585 --> 24:43.910
And I would read a book, and when I got into a book, nothing else was around.

24:44.531 --> 24:51.357
And I know that my soldiers are doing the same thing because we have a very active book, kind of passing the books.

24:51.377 --> 24:53.139
Individuals have brought us books.

24:53.159 --> 24:57.483
And I'm sure there's other units where your family supported and sent you books.

24:57.503 --> 25:05.250
Now it's a place, once you've read those books, that you can then donate them here because that becomes a repository that we can then pass on.

25:05.517 --> 25:33.938
that kind of that good feeling that kind of escape for a minute or two or until you hear the failure guns going on like last night or uh we have incoming but it really provides a way for all of our soldiers sailors marines and airmen to share the experience and also to pass on that goodness that they got from their family support groups and we will be more than happy to take these out to the outline of i know my soldiers

25:34.154 --> 25:39.300
They might go through them before they send them out there and, you know, pull out some of the favorite ones that they like too.

25:39.640 --> 25:44.866
But we really appreciate all the hard work because you see the end result of this.

25:45.507 --> 25:50.212
But you don't think of the hours that all of those Boy Scouts did.

25:50.672 --> 26:00.263
How do we get it over here, the boxing, the paying for the packaging, the logistical support, which is what we do in Third Cost Tom is logistical support.

26:00.648 --> 26:01.649
And that's the part.

26:01.690 --> 26:08.660
We see the end result, but it took a lot of hard work and labor and labors of love without knowing what the outcome was going to be.

26:09.020 --> 26:12.586
And so thank you, and I know Brian and the PAO spearheaded that.

26:12.626 --> 26:18.475
So thank you, and I'm glad you accepted it.

26:18.495 --> 26:19.176
Thank you.

26:19.196 --> 26:20.217
In that room, we have coffee.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.140
If there's anybody who'd like coffee, maybe too hot.

26:22.200 --> 26:22.841
There's water.

26:23.182 --> 26:26.807
We have enough cookies, I was told, for 200 to 300 solvers.

26:26.872 --> 26:28.273
So there's plenty of things.

26:28.293 --> 26:31.537
We're going to open that back door back there and get some air flowing through.

26:32.157 --> 26:36.121
And the last thing I'd like to say, Mr. Matham is a media rep from Belod.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.864
I'd hoped that he would come here today, that he'd be able to make it.

26:39.264 --> 26:44.970
Because he's the contact that I have from a visit I made with the surgeon's office to Belod about a week ago.

26:44.990 --> 26:52.037
He did not make it, but we're going to continue to follow that up nonetheless and let him see the kinds of books and figure out which one's taking these first.

26:52.798 --> 26:56.642
So I do really want everybody to know that we have Iraqi friends

26:57.179 --> 27:00.147
in the local community that we have a connection with.

27:00.167 --> 27:01.090
Thank you very much.

27:01.110 --> 27:02.072
I appreciate you being here.

27:02.474 --> 27:06.324
And if anyone wants to check out a book, please feel free to do so.

27:06.745 --> 27:08.791
And all you have to do is we have a sign-in log right here.

27:09.754 --> 27:13.163
And I already have a volunteer to be the first to sign out a book.

27:13.717 --> 27:27.454
So anytime you want to sign a book, you just sign one out and then bring it back when you're done.

27:27.494 --> 27:29.937
Thank you very much.

27:30.297 --> 27:30.557
Thank you.

27:30.577 --> 27:32.700
This will be the first box that goes out.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.120
Okay.

27:33.141 --> 27:36.144
Let me show you the box.

27:36.164 --> 27:40.990
Are you ready to roll?

27:41.189 --> 27:48.500
You don't have to say anything.

27:48.600 --> 27:59.516
I'm just going to ask you a question.

27:59.536 --> 28:01.298
You don't have to speak to me.

28:01.318 --> 28:06.345
I'm not going to make you say anything.

28:06.365 --> 28:07.287
I'm just going to ask you a question.

28:09.290 --> 28:09.911
Where's the book?

28:09.931 --> 28:10.892
Where's the book?

28:10.990 --> 28:27.649
uh okay

28:27.865 --> 28:38.877
So, let me, if you want to take this book out.

28:40.900 --> 28:45.925
Okay, and who's your first name?

28:45.945 --> 28:48.268
Stephanie, your last name?

28:48.428 --> 28:53.093
What do you think about the library?

28:53.113 --> 28:53.213
Yeah?

28:53.233 --> 28:54.615
Be my guest, please.

28:54.815 --> 29:22.324
second repeat

29:22.692 --> 29:35.185
How long have you been here?

29:35.366 --> 29:49.881
How long have you been here?

29:50.468 --> 29:59.341
For several reasons, one is each one has a bridge in the place, so you get an active day for the bus.

29:59.361 --> 30:04.569
You typically get that bridge and water down a little bit, and it's not quite as much older.

30:04.589 --> 30:06.071
And I don't think it's a problem.

30:06.092 --> 30:07.414
And I am concerned about it.

30:07.434 --> 30:08.535
But we've got all over the place.

30:08.555 --> 30:10.418
I mean, you see, we've got all over the place.

30:10.887 --> 30:31.292
It's hard.

30:31.272 --> 30:56.571
all right

30:56.551 --> 31:19.335
I talked to him about curiosity.

31:19.687 --> 31:47.618
um because

31:47.868 --> 31:56.265
I take it this is the military history section.

31:56.425 --> 32:00.493
And what do you like to pronounce?

32:00.845 --> 32:05.693
And how do you think about it?

32:05.773 --> 32:09.699
I'm not correct.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.145
In the back.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.427
In the back.

32:14.827 --> 32:24.743
In everything we have, I've got to look at and make sure this stuff is really good.

32:24.723 --> 32:30.532
I think this is a good idea.

32:32.214 --> 32:32.956
Why?

32:33.036 --> 32:39.225
What are you going to do?

32:39.285 --> 32:43.912
That's a special case.

32:43.972 --> 32:48.099
Now, we've got one of the cases though.

32:48.119 --> 32:49.701
What's with that thing?

32:49.681 --> 33:13.225
perfect thank you

33:13.407 --> 33:35.415
I want to

33:35.395 --> 33:51.987
He sent a whole box of books and autographs to him.

33:51.967 --> 34:09.756
I don't know.

34:09.736 --> 34:34.630
i don't want to

34:34.610 --> 35:02.895
The end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year, the end of the year,

35:02.875 --> 35:25.168
and the people to the middle of the night, I'm sure enough.

35:25.188 --> 35:25.909
The crisis of her life has moved in.

35:25.929 --> 35:28.373
Her life was through a life that was about four years ago.

35:28.393 --> 35:29.574
She was not only an honorary member, she was not a veteran.

35:29.594 --> 35:30.035
She was not a veteran.

35:30.055 --> 35:30.496
She was not a veteran.

35:30.516 --> 35:31.016
She was not a veteran.

35:31.036 --> 35:31.397
She was a veteran.

35:31.748 --> 35:41.580
which is about, one of the campuses is about the library that we have.

35:41.700 --> 35:45.044
It's only a couple of days.

35:45.104 --> 35:46.946
We're going.

35:46.966 --> 35:53.133
I have two books that I haven't read.

35:53.173 --> 36:01.283
I'm just starting with one of the others, and this is one of the children's books.

36:01.533 --> 36:13.430
Tell her what it's about, because she knows.

36:13.530 --> 36:24.906
I asked her in a minute in about two weeks, so I said, I don't want to find anybody.

36:25.006 --> 36:26.428
It's a great place.

36:26.448 --> 36:26.528
Yes.

36:27.301 --> 36:44.145
I'm hoping that it will be a period of, you know, talk about those kids.

36:44.885 --> 37:07.652
get around trying to get out

37:08.172 --> 37:10.158
.

37:10.178 --> 37:23.154
.

37:23.174 --> 37:23.194
.

37:23.174 --> 37:41.421
I didn't have to worry about where I was going to go.

37:41.441 --> 37:41.701
I don't know.

37:41.721 --> 37:44.245
I don't know.

37:44.265 --> 37:49.232
Is it anything like a man talking about?

37:49.668 --> 38:10.191
I really wanted to start with all these thinking, what's your greatest feeling.

38:10.171 --> 38:36.766
It's 10 years of thinking and I researched thoroughly.

38:36.786 --> 38:37.487
And I talked about a lot of people.

38:37.507 --> 38:38.288
I have a very famous author about that.

38:38.268 --> 39:01.283
There it is.

39:01.303 --> 39:01.684
I knew it was here.

39:01.704 --> 39:01.924
Right here.

39:01.944 --> 39:02.385
I gotta show you this.

39:02.365 --> 39:06.473
I can't believe it.

39:06.553 --> 39:18.095
This is a great anecdote.

39:18.496 --> 39:21.842
I love it.

39:22.025 --> 39:38.333
Here's the ending of the motion.

39:38.353 --> 39:41.820
I'm going to have the teacher in about two minutes.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.501
I'm not going to have the answer.

39:42.521 --> 39:44.404
I don't think I'm going.

39:44.384 --> 39:49.634
.

39:49.654 --> 39:50.817
.

39:50.837 --> 40:02.680
.

40:02.660 --> 40:08.687
.

40:08.707 --> 40:14.794
.

40:14.814 --> 40:29.171
.

40:29.191 --> 40:29.792
.

40:29.812 --> 40:29.832
.

40:29.812 --> 40:47.332
I love your remarks.

40:47.693 --> 40:56.443
I work at PAO.

40:56.930 --> 41:12.542
you know

41:12.944 --> 41:19.094
Yeah.

41:19.154 --> 41:22.339
Yeah.

41:23.441 --> 41:39.728
Yeah.

41:39.708 --> 41:45.635
Do you guys have a question?

41:47.357 --> 41:50.060
Are you ready?

41:50.080 --> 41:50.501
No.

41:50.521 --> 41:51.042
You've got to read it.

41:51.062 --> 41:51.502
You've got to read it.

41:51.522 --> 41:51.963
You've got to read it.

41:51.983 --> 41:52.543
You've got to read it.

41:52.563 --> 41:53.004
You've got to read it.

41:53.024 --> 41:54.205
You've got to read it.

41:54.225 --> 41:54.766
You've got to read it.

41:54.786 --> 41:55.227
You've got to read it.

41:55.247 --> 41:55.687
You've got to read it.

41:55.707 --> 41:56.148
You've got to read it.

41:56.168 --> 41:56.608
You've got to read it.

41:56.628 --> 41:57.029
I've got to read it.

41:57.049 --> 41:57.449
I've got to read it.

41:57.469 --> 41:57.870
I've got to read it.

41:57.890 --> 41:58.290
I've got to read it.

41:58.310 --> 41:58.711
I've got to read it.

41:58.731 --> 41:59.131
I've got to read it.

41:59.151 --> 41:59.572
I've got to read it.

41:59.592 --> 42:00.012
I've got to read it.

42:00.032 --> 42:00.433
I've got to read it.

42:00.453 --> 42:00.873
I've got to read it.

42:00.893 --> 42:01.294
I've got to read it.

42:01.314 --> 42:01.754
I've got to read it.

42:01.774 --> 42:02.215
I've got to read it.

42:02.235 --> 42:02.635
I've got to read it.

42:02.655 --> 42:03.056
I've got to read it.

42:03.076 --> 42:03.516
I've got to read it.

42:03.536 --> 42:03.937
I've got to read it.

42:03.957 --> 42:04.357
I've got to read it.

42:04.377 --> 42:04.798
I've got to read it.

42:04.818 --> 42:04.838
I

42:04.818 --> 42:10.708
Well, he gave it to you every year.

42:10.728 --> 42:14.234
I got a school program.

42:14.254 --> 42:20.845
I'll give you two.

42:20.865 --> 42:25.073
I'll give you one back.

42:25.093 --> 42:27.096
I keep one from my house.

42:27.076 --> 42:44.663
Thank you.

42:44.643 --> 43:03.664
How long are you going to be around?

43:03.644 --> 43:12.455
I mean, it's not like, well, it's worth it.

43:12.515 --> 43:16.259
Yeah, I mean, the girl is older.

43:16.279 --> 43:20.684
There's an interesting odd stuff here.

43:21.365 --> 43:26.772
So when you ask her to get old and that she has to be there.

43:26.792 --> 43:30.756
There's no count of this thousand years old in the spring.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.959
You're the same as popcorn?

43:33.445 --> 43:51.994
Thank you.

43:51.974 --> 44:01.133
They never know.

44:01.254 --> 44:09.932
One third of the book.

44:09.912 --> 44:38.029
We've got coffee, we've got money,

44:38.009 --> 44:48.406
Yeah?

44:49.909 --> 44:52.033
Great show, great show.

44:52.053 --> 45:02.150
Really, uh, so much of it.

45:02.170 --> 45:02.430
Keep kidding.

45:02.450 --> 45:03.392
Oh, I'm going to spend a lot of time with that.

45:03.412 --> 45:03.612
All right.

45:03.592 --> 45:16.504
Well, they're all focused on the same thing.

45:17.446 --> 45:45.664
uh... uh...

45:47.332 --> 45:49.535
So we're talking here to Colonel Nielsen.

45:49.555 --> 45:51.256
What's your first name?

45:51.277 --> 45:51.857
Thomas.

45:51.897 --> 45:52.978
Thomas Nielsen.

45:52.998 --> 45:55.601
Yeah, you haven't used the middle of Newfoundland.

45:55.621 --> 45:56.002
I'm a speedy.

45:56.262 --> 45:57.123
Okay.

45:57.143 --> 45:58.224
I ended up leading Des Moines.

45:58.285 --> 45:59.526
I moved to Wichita.

45:59.546 --> 46:00.067
I took the D.A.

46:00.247 --> 46:01.188
Sedona position.

46:01.308 --> 46:03.030
I left the Iowa Guard as a staff officer.

46:03.130 --> 46:08.436
When I got down there, I transferred to the 19th kid in the U.S.

46:08.977 --> 46:11.099
to General Bar in Des Moines.

46:11.179 --> 46:12.060
You don't mind me.

46:12.441 --> 46:14.503
But when they had the end of the third college town,

46:14.737 --> 46:19.063
They were so short personnel that they went out involuntarily, cross-leveled with a whole bunch of people.

46:19.664 --> 46:24.031
And I was one of the last teams who pulled in on a few days notice and I got thrown over there.

46:24.151 --> 46:32.663
So, I'm a single guy, so I've got a lot of stuff to pull over here to take care of, any of that kind of... And you've seen the actual biographies?

46:32.683 --> 46:34.826
It's not published yet.

46:35.187 --> 46:39.293
I was the train-side commander from CampDod.

46:39.593 --> 46:43.080
I've got a lot of Dodge Remobility.

46:43.101 --> 46:44.904
I've found a lot of things going on here.

46:45.145 --> 46:48.312
My book, the first book, didn't go back into the whole chapter.

46:48.733 --> 46:53.443
Well, I was going to write about the book piece, Stephen Blumberg.

46:54.124 --> 46:55.527
I'm the guy who wrote about that.

46:55.607 --> 46:56.509
I'll be right back.

46:56.529 --> 46:58.253
You want to get a couple of books?

47:00.017 --> 47:00.117
Yeah.

47:01.514 --> 47:23.725
So what were you doing?

47:23.941 --> 47:34.813
Yeah, there it is.

47:34.833 --> 47:36.354
Okay?

47:36.374 --> 47:43.662
Here's the antidote.

47:43.682 --> 47:52.272
I think it's a great antidote.

47:52.292 --> 47:52.632
What do you mean?

47:52.612 --> 48:19.530
What kind of thing?

48:20.793 --> 48:36.255
Okay, I'm on again.

48:40.100 --> 48:49.433
I was going to tell you, the publisher and the author, my cousin Jane Shore Myers is one of the editors of the Moines Register.

48:49.801 --> 48:54.270
and she won the Pulitzer Prize for the Register for investigative journalism.

48:54.510 --> 48:59.100
They used to take my stuff and write a column and they were one of my papers.

48:59.400 --> 49:03.749
She wrote for Nancy Weedem on a rape story in 1995.

49:04.551 --> 49:05.252
That's fabulous.

49:05.272 --> 49:09.420
She had a lot of writing for better homes and gardens and different things.

49:09.440 --> 49:11.725
Did you put your email address on that?

49:11.890 --> 49:12.832
Good.

49:12.852 --> 49:14.034
I'm in touch.

49:14.074 --> 49:16.037
Thanks for coming back.

49:16.117 --> 49:18.822
Again, I'm one of the supply guys here.

49:18.983 --> 49:21.367
I'll be here through the 15th September now.

49:21.848 --> 49:26.476
When I go home, the unit that I've launched has been reorganized on the way when I have you.

49:26.496 --> 49:30.523
They're forming a new unit for this one from over here in June of 07.

49:30.773 --> 49:33.978
So I won't let it go on maybe any point on Southampton.

49:33.998 --> 49:37.663
The good news is the 16th of March and my son is a medic.

49:37.703 --> 49:38.825
He won't be here.

49:38.845 --> 49:40.508
He'll be in Alassane.

49:40.528 --> 49:45.816
I'll get a chance to do it instead.

49:46.036 --> 49:47.879
You have to.

49:48.420 --> 49:53.567
Thank you, officer.

49:54.729 --> 49:57.253
Yeah.

49:57.436 --> 50:05.931
Well, I have a whole chapter on that in this new book.

50:06.372 --> 50:09.698
Well, can we buy a copy from you, or how do we get that?

50:09.818 --> 50:12.964
Well, you can e-mail me.

50:12.944 --> 50:33.400
I'd like to talk to you too.

50:33.380 --> 51:00.147
Is it coincidental that you go?

51:00.295 --> 51:10.067
So where's home for you two?

51:10.087 --> 51:12.415
South Dakota.

51:12.665 --> 51:21.098
How does that happen?

51:21.458 --> 51:24.463
How about a picture with you?

51:24.483 --> 51:25.164
No, we don't.

51:25.405 --> 51:36.201
As long as I'm not a razor.

51:36.962 --> 51:41.389
So, like I'm a case disorder buddy here, just a little bit curious about that.

51:42.668 --> 51:43.449
You're a physician?

51:43.809 --> 51:45.611
I'm a physician and my wife's a nurse.

51:45.631 --> 51:46.111
And us?

51:46.131 --> 51:48.153
And what's the unit that you're in?

51:48.193 --> 51:49.374
We're at the 3rd COSCOM.

51:49.794 --> 51:51.176
And how long have you been here?

51:51.656 --> 51:56.921
Well, we came here in October to Iraq and then we actually joined the COSCOM last November.

51:57.681 --> 52:02.426
I was previously commander of a hospital in Omaha and then we transferred to this new position in the COSCOM.

52:02.986 --> 52:04.207
And are you a career military?

52:04.287 --> 52:06.089
You would say so, yeah.

52:06.189 --> 52:07.170
I have 26 years of duty.

52:07.570 --> 52:10.633
And how about yourself?

52:10.799 --> 52:12.000
Complainted my 21st.

52:12.381 --> 52:13.022
Wow.

52:13.442 --> 52:17.848
I don't know if you gave me your full names of the tapes, but let me get my notebook.

52:18.328 --> 52:18.989
All right.

52:19.009 --> 52:26.398
Well, I'm going to do that, probably, to check over her and her books.

52:26.418 --> 52:29.362
We have to talk to each other.

52:29.382 --> 52:30.403
We've got about 25.

52:30.423 --> 52:31.865
So, all different kinds of issues.

52:31.905 --> 52:34.348
There's a lot of structural names in there.

52:34.368 --> 52:34.729
A lot of stuff.

52:34.749 --> 52:39.375
You have to write down your names and... How do you get a call on them?

52:39.395 --> 52:39.675
No.

52:40.786 --> 52:43.489
It's better to have you write it down.

52:43.509 --> 52:48.634
That way I can... So how long did you work here for?

52:48.774 --> 52:50.316
It'll be for one year.

52:50.336 --> 52:51.277
So we got here in October.

52:51.297 --> 52:52.538
We'll go back like in September.

52:53.980 --> 52:55.762
And then we actually left our homes in July.

52:55.782 --> 52:57.023
It takes a while to mobilize.

52:57.103 --> 53:02.429
And it'll take you probably another year a week to probably a month after we leave her to get home.

53:02.449 --> 53:03.710
And so home again in where?

53:03.890 --> 53:04.611
South Dakota.

53:04.671 --> 53:06.393
South Dakota, you said that, right?

53:06.413 --> 53:09.396
Native to South Dakota?

53:10.057 --> 53:10.337
Correct.

53:10.773 --> 53:11.854
Congratulations.

53:11.875 --> 53:14.879
Our oldest son is in Afghanistan.

53:14.939 --> 53:16.000
Is that his name?

53:16.020 --> 53:16.200
Yeah.

53:16.381 --> 53:17.262
He's a young lieutenant.

53:17.282 --> 53:18.464
He's working with the 173rd.

53:18.824 --> 53:19.645
Fantastic.

53:19.685 --> 53:22.529
He's leaving in just a few days from now.

53:23.751 --> 53:25.073
Well, thank you very much for your time.

53:25.093 --> 53:25.934
It's been a pleasure.

53:25.954 --> 53:26.875
Thanks for coming by.

53:26.895 --> 53:27.095
Thank you.

53:27.136 --> 53:27.857
Thanks so much.

53:27.917 --> 53:29.919
Yeah, we'll get a copy of your book then.

53:30.300 --> 53:30.901
Yeah, we'll do that.

53:30.921 --> 53:31.341
We'll read that.

53:31.482 --> 53:31.882
That's good.

53:31.902 --> 53:32.423
Well, thank you.

53:32.443 --> 53:33.064
Thanks so much.

53:33.204 --> 53:33.805
Yeah, my pleasure.

53:33.825 --> 53:34.646
Good luck to you both.

53:34.926 --> 53:36.949
Safe journeys.

53:40.034 --> 53:44.180
I'm talking from Spencer Case Specialist.

53:44.200 --> 53:44.781
How old are you, Spencer?

53:44.801 --> 53:48.407
You told me, how do you like to be called?

53:48.427 --> 53:48.988
Spencer?

53:49.629 --> 53:51.952
Spencer's found since I'm always Specialist Case.

53:52.233 --> 53:55.398
Yeah, well, for that, I'm Nick.

53:55.498 --> 53:56.700
Of course, it's name basis.

53:56.760 --> 53:57.501
It's fine with Nick.

53:59.243 --> 54:01.507
You apparently were going to college, I guess.

54:01.527 --> 54:02.088
Is that right?

54:02.849 --> 54:03.089
Yes.

54:03.410 --> 54:05.173
I was at the university, and I'm 20, by the way.

54:05.373 --> 54:06.414
Okay, 20 years old.

54:06.915 --> 54:08.117
And so you were at...

54:08.570 --> 54:12.636
You told me last night, I wanted to tell you again, where you were going to school.

54:13.677 --> 54:14.919
Idaho State University.

54:15.059 --> 54:15.920
And you were studying?

54:15.980 --> 54:22.889
Well, I wasn't, you can't really say, I couldn't really say I was studying anything, because I'm so early in school.

54:22.950 --> 54:27.436
I have got a declared major, but really I was just doing my general classes.

54:29.078 --> 54:33.464
I'm technically an English major, but... Are you a freshman?

54:33.784 --> 54:34.665
Technically I am.

54:34.725 --> 54:38.070
It's kind of weird, because I've got three semesters, so...

54:38.894 --> 54:40.076
Your sophomore?

54:40.096 --> 54:40.637
I guess so.

54:41.338 --> 54:50.071
And English major, I'm kind of an English major, but I guess writing, is this something that was going to you?

54:50.091 --> 54:50.712
Absolutely.

54:50.752 --> 54:53.797
Writing's always been the biggest thing to have told me.

54:54.478 --> 55:00.006
But you don't need a degree in writing to be a writer.

55:01.348 --> 55:02.931
Okay.

55:03.812 --> 55:05.695
And I've always loved journalism school.

55:06.535 --> 55:11.943
Nobody learns how to be a journalist, but no IJ is a cool person to learn about doing it.

55:11.963 --> 55:19.935
And so, uh, you can tell me about how hard you can hear it, what can your calculus work that brings to this place sometimes.

55:20.976 --> 55:21.637
Interesting.

55:21.657 --> 55:23.860
I actually wrote an essay.

55:25.022 --> 55:25.543
Say again?

55:25.563 --> 55:29.689
I actually wrote an essay about it you might want to read.

55:29.909 --> 55:30.330
Okay.

55:30.530 --> 55:31.352
It's called Joining the Army.

55:32.233 --> 55:34.416
It might give you some idea.

55:34.818 --> 55:36.921
since I understand you like to read.

55:37.943 --> 55:41.208
But really I never saw myself in the Army at all.

55:41.509 --> 55:47.278
I always thought of myself as a guy who likes to write a lot.

55:48.360 --> 55:52.887
But I remember it was the summer after my high school graduation.

55:53.589 --> 55:54.330
Which was what year?

55:54.350 --> 55:56.213
2003.

55:56.433 --> 56:00.640
I spent the summer down in Texas.

56:00.957 --> 56:03.459
trying to sell bug spray.

56:03.479 --> 56:05.421
I had never really lived away from my parents.

56:05.481 --> 56:06.502
That was my first attempt.

56:07.523 --> 56:09.305
And it wasn't a particularly encouraging one.

56:09.966 --> 56:11.507
And home again is where?

56:12.008 --> 56:13.950
Pocatello, Idaho.

56:14.330 --> 56:23.359
So I came back and I visited the school just before the semester started, my first semester of college.

56:24.200 --> 56:29.445
And I ran into another person who went through a Marine boot camp.

56:30.134 --> 56:33.618
And he was all, you gotta go Marines, you gotta go Marines.

56:34.500 --> 56:40.047
And he told me that, you know, you could be a writer in the military and that interested me.

56:42.189 --> 56:49.539
And I got a job writing for my college newspaper.

56:50.180 --> 56:53.424
And I guess I was probably the youngest one that ever hired for that.

56:54.605 --> 56:56.648
But I got bored with it.

56:57.083 --> 57:04.995
And I thought, you know, it would be interesting to develop my writing career in a different way.

57:06.417 --> 57:08.140
And so I considered the military thing.

57:10.363 --> 57:19.817
And I talked to a recruiter, and he kept trying to show me as a petroleum supply specialist that I'm like, it's not happening, man.

57:20.438 --> 57:26.047
And I told him I wasn't going to sign a contract until he could guarantee me 46-foot best, which is a very rare MOS.

57:27.309 --> 57:29.392
And he got desperate enough, and he did.

57:30.574 --> 57:33.678
I got it, and I was lucky because there was only one slot left in the country.

57:36.042 --> 57:38.185
So I went to basic training.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.469
I hated basic training.

57:42.051 --> 57:43.173
AIT was a little better.

57:43.614 --> 57:44.815
AIT is what?

57:44.836 --> 57:45.557
That's what they do.

57:45.677 --> 57:49.062
It's like you go to your basic training, which is just general soldier skills.

57:49.463 --> 57:52.206
And AIT is like where they teach you specifically your job.

57:53.867 --> 57:54.988
And where did you go?

57:55.909 --> 57:57.090
Fort Meade, Maryland.

57:57.190 --> 57:57.491
Oh, yeah.

57:57.811 --> 57:59.593
Well, that's where the information school is.

57:59.653 --> 58:01.054
That's where I went to.

58:01.355 --> 58:06.580
I was a graduate of the Defense Information School when I was in Fort Arizona.

58:09.202 --> 58:09.542
Right.

58:09.803 --> 58:14.427
So did you realize that you probably would be, or that you undoubtedly would be going on active duty?

58:14.647 --> 58:17.310
I had no illusions about that.

58:18.100 --> 58:19.262
It was 2004.

58:20.263 --> 58:21.445
The war was going on.

58:21.465 --> 58:27.014
The war had been going on for eight months when I signed the contract, so I knew there was going to be here.

58:27.034 --> 58:27.494
You did know?

58:28.035 --> 58:28.175
Mm-hmm.

58:28.195 --> 58:29.217
Yeah.

58:29.638 --> 58:33.403
And that didn't play any factor?

58:33.424 --> 58:40.935
It actually encouraged me because it may sound weird because it's just so not like me.

58:41.371 --> 58:55.893
I realized there are millions of people out there who like books and like writing and like the same things I do, but I thought I might be in danger of trapping myself into being sort of closed-minded.

58:56.074 --> 58:59.298
Not really closed-minded, but having a very narrow range of experiences.

59:00.500 --> 59:09.454
I decided it was early enough in my life I could change that by forcing myself to do something very out of character, like joining the military.

59:09.788 --> 59:14.212
How long do you see yourself going with it?

59:14.232 --> 59:15.673
I'm going to pitch for it.

59:16.194 --> 59:18.456
My contract is until April 2012.

59:18.496 --> 59:18.976
2012?

59:20.778 --> 59:21.058
Yeah.

59:21.799 --> 59:28.265
So you expect to be in uniform for the next six years?

59:28.445 --> 59:31.467
I mean, really?

59:31.487 --> 59:32.188
Really?

59:32.268 --> 59:33.369
That's a long time.

59:33.509 --> 59:34.210
I'm in the reserve.

59:34.830 --> 59:37.753
Would you be on active duty for the next six years?

59:38.645 --> 59:39.226
No.

59:39.246 --> 59:47.393
I'll be in the reserve, but they can call me up basically any time within that time frame.

59:47.433 --> 59:55.320
Last night at dinner, we were having that little go-around, and I think Ronald and the Grace began it with the books, the three books.

59:55.360 --> 59:57.502
Do you remember the three that you mentioned?

59:57.522 --> 59:58.944
Very well, because I had to think about it.

59:58.964 --> 59:59.604
So go ahead.

01:00:00.045 --> 01:00:01.746
Let's do it now while the favorite book is running.

01:00:01.826 --> 01:00:03.188
Okay.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:08.112
My number one choice was The Iceberg Sermon by Arthur Roth.

01:00:08.412 --> 01:00:13.938
because that was a book that really, really grabbed me when I was really young.

01:00:14.499 --> 01:00:20.345
It's been a long time since I've read it, and I should probably read it because it's still sitting on my shelf back at home.

01:00:20.365 --> 01:00:22.207
And when you say very young, how old?

01:00:22.228 --> 01:00:22.488
Ten.

01:00:22.648 --> 01:00:23.028
Ten.

01:00:23.048 --> 01:00:23.669
I was ten.

01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:29.295
We had this thing for, like, Christmas break.

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:33.040
The teacher had, like, a box of three books.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.162
He handed it out to everyone, and that was the one that I got.

01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:41.419
And I liked it, and so it was my first book.

01:00:41.439 --> 01:00:43.361
How many readings have you given it?

01:00:44.002 --> 01:00:44.302
Three.

01:00:44.983 --> 01:00:55.878
Actually, three, and then there was one teacher who would read books at the class for a certain amount of time per day, and so she read it for classes.

01:00:55.898 --> 01:00:58.221
I guess I heard it a fourth time.

01:00:59.503 --> 01:01:03.208
And so what is it about this that...

01:01:03.509 --> 01:01:05.831
I don't know.

01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:26.850
It was about this 17-year-old whaler who gets abandoned in the middle of the Arctic Ocean on a piece of ice, and how he ended up surviving and making it back to Scotland.

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.032
And I liked the isolation of it.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:32.976
I liked how, you know, he was

01:01:33.817 --> 01:01:43.187
He was confronting these physical dangers, and yet there were all these mental dangers of giving up in himself, too, that the character faces.

01:01:47.552 --> 01:01:49.093
Well, that looks good.

01:01:49.114 --> 01:01:52.457
We'll have to check that out.

01:01:52.477 --> 01:01:55.320
That's very interesting.

01:01:55.981 --> 01:02:03.469
So, is it a book that you really like, or do you feel it's something that's interesting?

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.405
affected your life in any kind of way.
