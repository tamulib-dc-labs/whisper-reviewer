00:05.718 --> 00:11.384
I just wanted to tell you we have made a dummy of the new journal.

00:11.404 --> 00:15.389
It will be larger, it shall be one centimeter more.

00:15.409 --> 00:18.312
I don't know what it is in English.

00:18.332 --> 00:20.775
How does Biblis translate?

00:20.935 --> 00:22.216
Biblis?

00:22.316 --> 00:27.482
Well, it's not possible to translate because it's just a nickname.

00:27.702 --> 00:32.628
It has a nickname of Bibliotek as a library.

00:32.648 --> 00:34.830
It's a nickname for the Swedish word for library.

00:35.063 --> 00:37.206
For books.

00:37.506 --> 00:39.308
Make them for books.

00:39.508 --> 00:43.814
Joey, we made some sketches here for what it would look like.

00:45.075 --> 00:48.319
Quite... Now, are you going to try and market this?

00:48.560 --> 00:49.781
Yes, very heavy.

00:51.343 --> 00:59.113
But before these... They are about... Subscribers.

00:59.133 --> 01:03.819
Yes, we raised the subscribers from 1,000 to 1,500.

01:03.999 --> 01:05.020
That's 50%.

01:05.168 --> 01:12.438
But then it has fallen again because we haven't had... Well, since I'm... I haven't got time to... Put a woman on the cover.

01:13.259 --> 01:14.401
Yeah, probably.

01:14.421 --> 01:19.167
My idea is... Reading a book naked, reading a book, you sell it.

01:19.187 --> 01:30.523
My idea is that you get rid of the 1500 straddles a day and you get 4,000 new ones.

01:30.563 --> 01:34.028
Because they see how it works with...

01:34.193 --> 01:46.330
Do you have a community of bibliophiles?

01:46.511 --> 02:01.332
No, I don't think so.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.268
What do you mean by community?

02:03.449 --> 02:04.189
A group of people.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.310
We're here now.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.752
Yes, we're here.

02:06.772 --> 02:08.233
I'm here.

02:08.313 --> 02:10.135
In the old days, it covers a cell.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.278
I mean, it's like... There are very few.

02:14.139 --> 02:18.503
I know of two very limited groups.

02:18.523 --> 02:19.764
One started in 1963.

02:19.824 --> 02:29.293
And one of the most famous librarians also started the rare book department of the Royal Library.

02:29.628 --> 02:31.915
His name is Sten G. Wimberg.

02:33.059 --> 02:42.709
He had a group around him which is called, from his initial, SGL.

02:44.528 --> 02:49.015
When he had chosen the men, I think it was about 20.

02:49.035 --> 02:49.976
By invitation.

02:50.157 --> 02:53.782
Yes, by 20 elections.

02:53.802 --> 03:00.813
It wasn't in that... It was about 20 of them at the beginning.

03:01.494 --> 03:08.725
And they went to different libraries and looked at books.

03:08.745 --> 03:11.089
But you don't have a club like they call their club?

03:11.169 --> 03:13.152
No, not that way.

03:13.672 --> 03:25.372
Ten years ago, I started another group which is called Argentine Society, which is no society at all.

03:25.893 --> 03:30.721
It's a parody.

03:30.801 --> 03:38.194
You see, I can't phone a cow at a casa and say,

03:38.444 --> 03:42.989
I would like to see your books in your library.

03:43.689 --> 03:45.411
It's definitely impossible.

03:45.651 --> 03:57.764
But I can send a very beautiful letter from the Vargeting Society and ask that the members are very interesting to see his imposing library.

03:57.824 --> 04:00.547
Vargety is the father of demographics.

04:01.187 --> 04:03.430
Yes, yes.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.852
And we have been now

04:05.967 --> 04:09.332
He was living in Austria and Bohemia.

04:09.692 --> 04:16.823
And we looked at 12 roster libraries which have never been opened to other people.

04:17.123 --> 04:25.275
It's the highest amount, what you call it, they opened the doors and we looked at

04:25.542 --> 04:50.605
extremely fine yes it's a name yes and he was the secretary of the swedish academy of science so it's named after a person yes he was a man on the demographics

04:50.990 --> 05:00.963
I understand.

05:00.983 --> 05:05.649
I can't tell you.

05:05.709 --> 05:12.637
Someone asked me, there is no society for Varginthine, he told me, a friend.

05:12.898 --> 05:13.599
Yes, I said.

05:14.600 --> 05:14.880
When?

05:15.461 --> 05:16.082
Yes, now.

05:16.222 --> 05:18.685
It's not now.

05:18.800 --> 05:28.856
We have no connection inside the library.

05:28.976 --> 05:29.156
Yes.

05:29.337 --> 05:35.346
I mean, the first issue will arrive in February, March of this new journal.

05:35.366 --> 05:46.444
And what you could say is that it's a pity that it's printed in Swedish because you always reach a rather small amount of people and it's worth it.

05:47.116 --> 05:53.525
It's really nice to look at it.

05:53.866 --> 05:58.713
It's impenetrable, remember that word?

05:59.814 --> 06:06.103
It's a piece of art.

06:06.123 --> 06:06.664
It's wonderful.

06:07.165 --> 06:13.714
I'll bet the articles are great and I would probably... Uwe has written a lot of them, really.

06:13.863 --> 06:20.233
But in this last issue that is at the binders right now, Nicholas Barker has written on the book collector.

06:21.274 --> 06:26.162
I've interviewed him a couple of times, but is it in English?

06:26.402 --> 06:29.406
No, we have translated it well.

06:29.427 --> 06:32.351
Now what you should have done is also published it in English.

06:32.992 --> 06:36.898
Well, I think it has been published in English, really.

06:37.679 --> 06:39.341
I don't know if it was in the book collector.

06:39.362 --> 06:39.702
I see.

06:40.087 --> 06:51.685
I started, in fact, a book, a rare book, in 1985, which has, no, no, no, it's in Greece, I have never been in Greece.

06:51.705 --> 06:54.349
They have only been talking about it.

06:55.711 --> 07:00.739
I've been talking in English, and it's called Slotabata.

07:01.180 --> 07:07.950
And I have... It's not there.

07:08.251 --> 07:10.013
One day I saw it.

07:10.173 --> 07:13.918
But I had to collect some friends.

07:13.938 --> 07:16.581
Because it's impossible to do alone.

07:16.601 --> 07:18.443
Like a phoenix bird, it will rise again.

07:18.664 --> 07:18.924
Yes.

07:19.224 --> 07:26.994
And when it will start, I think it will be the most finest book.

07:27.054 --> 07:30.117
My book, Walletfield.

07:30.137 --> 07:31.379
Yeah, what is it?

07:31.399 --> 07:31.739
Through freedom.

07:31.759 --> 07:32.560
Through freedom.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.864
Go down by the ground again.

07:35.884 --> 07:37.206
If I may take a while.

07:37.226 --> 07:38.207
Yes, we thought it.

07:38.508 --> 07:51.263
Yes, but we should... I don't know if you know that the Bookfriend is a magazine for a book society.

07:51.323 --> 07:53.205
You can tell that.

07:53.225 --> 07:53.886
Oh, maybe, yes.

07:54.407 --> 07:58.312
So it's... But which is now finished.

07:58.372 --> 08:00.654
That's finished, but a new... But the society exists.

08:00.674 --> 08:03.898
They are sort of mixed between two... A merge.

08:04.098 --> 08:05.460
A merge between...

08:05.947 --> 08:21.066
The problem with those book magazines, I think, is the same as within librarians, that after a while, it will handle more about literature than books.

08:21.266 --> 08:25.712
For instance, a book monthly review, you know that.

08:26.212 --> 08:29.096
Today, it's mostly about literature.

08:29.116 --> 08:34.823
From the start, it handled much about old books and science books and medical books, everything.

08:35.478 --> 08:40.964
But today it's mostly detective and such things.

08:41.084 --> 08:42.025
Stories in Canada.

08:42.125 --> 08:50.314
Which is also very good, but there is no real magazine about old books.

08:53.938 --> 08:54.398
I don't know.

08:54.618 --> 09:03.848
Yes, because you have... Then it's my... I propose that this is Lars JÃ¶ngren, and I think that if we should finish here,

09:04.064 --> 09:18.025
we could go up to the library room and go up not to the heaven from this more or less hell... Just give us a little brief introduction for yourself.

09:18.345 --> 09:31.405
The background is that I were working in the same antiquarian firm as Ove, but only a year after him, in five years.

09:31.587 --> 09:42.096
I've been studying history and so on, and even I'm an educated librarian, and I've worked in different historical libraries.

09:43.357 --> 09:52.065
But then, as I make this a short note, I think I should speak a bit more about my work when we go up to the library room.

09:52.125 --> 09:52.385
Okay, fine.

09:52.786 --> 09:53.426
Sounds good to me.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.889
But you could state your name as well.

09:55.909 --> 09:56.469
Yeah.

09:56.489 --> 09:57.730
He's going to give me his card, too.

09:57.910 --> 09:58.211
Oh.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.612
Yes, he'll get my, yes, I think.

09:59.932 --> 10:00.953
Right now you're five.

10:01.473 --> 10:01.873
So?

10:01.894 --> 10:03.235
Right now you're number five.

10:03.255 --> 10:04.937
I'm number five, yes.

10:05.157 --> 10:07.060
I'm going to match number five.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.302
I know your name, but I want to spell it properly.

10:09.503 --> 10:09.723
Yes.

10:09.743 --> 10:10.824
I need the cards.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.769
If you take care of this one, so it is left.

10:14.809 --> 10:15.530
Have you been here before?

10:15.550 --> 10:16.872
You've never been here before.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.715
I'm just amazed about it.

10:20.196 --> 10:22.458
Do you know much about the library?

10:23.299 --> 10:27.885
No, I've seen it before you come.

10:28.507 --> 10:32.311
Is it an old library?

10:32.331 --> 10:33.372
Okay, so here we are.

10:33.412 --> 10:37.456
I speak about the modern world part.

10:37.977 --> 10:39.859
And Matt speaks about the old part.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.101
This is the old collection.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.903
This is pretty exceptional.

10:45.765 --> 10:55.375
I could begin to say that inside there we have the old collection and the other chart.

10:55.395 --> 10:55.695
This is

10:56.013 --> 11:03.661
a few books by especially the interest, we think, that is picked out here so you could easily see them.

11:05.263 --> 11:13.092
And we now could hear so I could make a statement that is written.

11:13.112 --> 11:23.623
On the other side, what he says, I say, I always make a difference between a library that is a museum that is one that is for historical research.

11:24.397 --> 11:27.961
And this one is in the first hand for historical research.

11:29.663 --> 11:46.624
Even if you are very glad and happy to have open beautiful books, our first aim from the Academy's point of view is to respond and to work for the studies in the history of other countries.

11:46.958 --> 11:52.946
And these books are one background for these studies.

11:52.966 --> 11:55.489
And we have several others.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.630
Can I just interrupt?

11:57.011 --> 11:58.633
Give me some background on the academy.

11:58.713 --> 12:14.113
The academy then, its work in 1813 had some small societies in the earlier times, but it was grounded to expand the work

12:14.363 --> 12:22.892
with agriculture here, because a lot of people were having difficulty in fame and so on.

12:24.814 --> 12:33.162
And it is a private foundation.

12:33.182 --> 12:42.632
So, and the health question today at the academy is not the history,

12:42.680 --> 12:44.605
It always has been the future.

12:45.628 --> 12:51.724
But my part is to look backwards.

12:53.448 --> 12:57.178
And we work for the studies or the history

12:57.698 --> 12:59.321
I give you a small booklet.

12:59.601 --> 13:02.366
So your library is a historical library?

13:02.386 --> 13:06.192
Yes, but with many new books.

13:06.893 --> 13:11.261
And then we go up to the book room.

13:11.982 --> 13:15.368
I can show you the sorts of books that we are buying.

13:16.269 --> 13:18.072
What is the size of your collection?

13:19.034 --> 13:21.799
Just roughly.

13:21.859 --> 13:22.660
Say...

13:23.382 --> 13:29.609
the monographs about the kilometers and then periodicals and other kilometers.

13:31.091 --> 13:32.072
But what's that about?

13:32.092 --> 13:33.034
40,000 volumes?

13:33.534 --> 13:39.802
Yeah, you almost count about 40 to 50 volumes to every meter.

13:42.245 --> 13:52.697
And the old books that Matsa is speaking about here are a collection of about 200 meters, all in the agrarian fields, more or less.

13:52.947 --> 13:57.432
So we count in terms of meters?

13:57.712 --> 13:57.973
Yes.

13:59.474 --> 14:01.316
How many meters altogether again?

14:02.197 --> 14:02.938
That's 40,000.

14:03.139 --> 14:13.510
About 1,000 meters monographs and 1,000 periodicals.

14:13.550 --> 14:16.994
That's 40,000 periodicals.

14:18.356 --> 14:21.199
That's not meters, that's period, that's numbers.

14:21.348 --> 14:28.037
So this is a bit different from those libraries I've been working in now.

14:28.398 --> 14:30.220
The Karolinska Institute, for instance.

14:30.441 --> 14:42.217
That is a modern research library, the greatest in Scandinavia, with, I think, several thousands of students every day coming for research.

14:43.319 --> 14:46.083
So that is, I think, the problem also for the librarians.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.626
They have no idea about their own connections.

14:48.887 --> 14:50.629
So it's a bit...

14:50.795 --> 14:53.798
So we have a very specified area we're working in.

14:54.118 --> 15:03.849
The problem with the Karolinska Institute is that they are all of the library working to get new knowledge.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.812
Who basically are your readers here?

15:06.872 --> 15:15.180
They are researchers and students in the historical and cultural interdisciplinarity.

15:15.881 --> 15:19.705
And also modern researchers that need a background.

15:20.123 --> 15:34.698
For example, the research in the forestry, as they have a 100 years view for the trees growing up and so on, they are interested to see how early researchers were working.

15:35.198 --> 15:39.803
Also the history of economics and other things about agriculture.

15:39.823 --> 15:42.285
Can I drop your card?

15:42.986 --> 15:47.110
No, you should get the English one.

15:47.478 --> 15:55.452
If you might speak about those ones, then I'll speak more about the library.

15:55.572 --> 16:09.756
I'll show you some books from different fields of the collections and there is a lot of books that is not

16:10.040 --> 16:15.550
really agricultural for me.

16:15.710 --> 16:20.118
But they are beautiful.

16:20.799 --> 16:24.986
I think these are horticulture anyhow.

16:25.467 --> 16:31.778
Are any of these books that you found that you provided here?

16:31.859 --> 16:33.081
No, no.

16:33.261 --> 16:35.584
I'm not selling anything.

16:35.664 --> 16:37.627
I'm buying the bibliographic material from you.

16:37.867 --> 16:39.129
I see.

16:39.309 --> 16:43.074
You're not buying so many books?

16:43.094 --> 16:43.454
No, no.

16:43.474 --> 16:48.541
Look at the colour that American botanical sketches make.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.382
Yes, it's really nice.

16:49.422 --> 16:50.424
These are lithographs?

16:50.964 --> 16:52.166
What did you say?

16:52.186 --> 16:53.207
Yeah.

16:53.227 --> 16:54.950
It's handcaps, handcaps.

16:55.651 --> 16:55.991
Really?

16:56.331 --> 16:58.895
They are not lithographs.

16:58.915 --> 17:00.357
It's beautiful, isn't it?

17:00.377 --> 17:01.258
It's the engravings.

17:01.525 --> 17:04.629
Wow, that's magnificent.

17:04.689 --> 17:08.894
1811, look at the condition of that.

17:09.775 --> 17:14.461
This is one of the earliest books on fruits.

17:14.982 --> 17:18.927
It's really a nice book.

17:18.967 --> 17:19.968
Magnificent.

17:20.949 --> 17:22.491
So how did these come into the collection?

17:23.372 --> 17:23.893
Donations.

17:25.054 --> 17:26.496
All of it, more or less.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.760
It has been, the library has been

17:30.061 --> 17:36.167
the hand library and the research library for the academy from 1813 and so on.

17:36.487 --> 17:43.754
But it had been completed with a lot of donations with older books and more spectacular books.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.677
And this one, which you look at now.

17:46.697 --> 17:48.178
The same thing as what I told about.

17:48.559 --> 17:54.064
For instance, a professor in 1813, he donated his collection.

17:54.464 --> 17:58.988
But in that collection was also books from the early 16th century.

17:59.529 --> 17:59.629
Sure.

17:59.997 --> 18:05.063
And the Academy also gets some whole library.

18:05.383 --> 18:05.524
Yes.

18:05.544 --> 18:11.491
The Stockholm Gaffner Society, and the... For the culture.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.913
And you kept all the book plates, which is nice, too.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.436
Yes, it's really nice.

18:16.537 --> 18:18.439
And this is a really nice book.

18:18.479 --> 18:19.460
How old was this book?

18:19.480 --> 18:20.782
1684.

18:20.862 --> 18:22.524
It looked 17th century, at least.

18:22.544 --> 18:24.486
Yes, and it's...

18:24.871 --> 18:28.216
The flora in Sweden.

18:28.236 --> 18:30.198
Is that an original binding?

18:30.859 --> 18:35.506
You see, how primitive, if I may say so, we were.

18:35.546 --> 18:38.190
This is the first illustration of the flora.

18:38.630 --> 18:38.931
Really?

18:39.431 --> 18:41.795
And it's not so easy to see what you see.

18:43.637 --> 18:45.159
At least it's a fact of a hard one.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.302
It's for medical use.

18:47.322 --> 18:47.543
I see.

18:51.148 --> 18:52.870
It's really a nice pocket.

18:54.554 --> 18:59.859
I've got those ones so that it's more international, especially this one.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.081
Oh, this is gorgeous.

19:01.842 --> 19:07.788
Here I think you see two of the most expensive botanical books in the world.

19:08.328 --> 19:15.195
This is Redoutes, Le Liliac, printed in 200 copies.

19:15.436 --> 19:17.217
You have one of those here in this collection?

19:17.318 --> 19:18.739
Yes, this is ours.

19:19.478 --> 19:20.961
Wow, that's very impressive.

19:21.702 --> 19:29.736
And on the botanical auction recently... At least a million dollars.

19:29.776 --> 19:33.101
Yes, it was 154,000 pounds.

19:33.482 --> 19:33.823
Have one.

19:34.724 --> 19:36.467
That's your friends.

19:37.729 --> 19:40.474
And this is a special plant.

19:40.808 --> 19:42.149
Yes, the same picture.

19:42.350 --> 19:46.434
I'll just take a couple of them.

19:46.554 --> 19:50.198
I have a curious story about this special plant if you are interested.

19:51.940 --> 20:01.951
This plant came from north of Peru in South America and it was sent to Linnaeus in Uppsala.

20:02.071 --> 20:09.820
At that time we had a pupil whose name was Johan Frank.

20:10.323 --> 20:13.186
And he was very clever, but very poor.

20:14.107 --> 20:25.699
And he had got help from the countryside where he came from, from Jonas AhlstrÃ¶mer, one of the richest men in Sweden at that time.

20:27.160 --> 20:34.007
And he had written his dissertation on botany for Linnaeus.

20:34.788 --> 20:38.912
Linnaeus wanted to have a name on this plant.

20:39.263 --> 20:46.331
He told Johan Falk, shouldn't we call it AlstrÃ¶meria?

20:47.232 --> 20:51.217
From his family name.

20:51.838 --> 20:54.101
Yes, it was called AlstrÃ¶meria.

20:54.121 --> 20:55.482
From AlstrÃ¶meria.

20:55.723 --> 21:05.234
Then he took his examiner and it was very good.

21:05.814 --> 21:08.798
But Mr. Falk, he was...

21:09.503 --> 21:11.565
at times very down and very high.

21:11.966 --> 21:22.718
I think he used some of the drugs, drugs in the plants, you know, which I think many medical men did at that time.

21:23.759 --> 21:37.215
I've never heard that before, but it sounds perfectly... He was chosen to follow Mr. ForsgÃ¥rd from Arabia to see the...

21:37.634 --> 21:46.026
the pupil of the Nears who was chosen to follow the Danish expedition to Arabia, one of the greatest expeditions of that time.

21:46.887 --> 21:50.993
But he didn't, in some way.

21:51.014 --> 21:54.799
It was very lucky for him because all of them died.

21:55.387 --> 22:00.594
Isn't this three volumes or four volumes?

22:00.614 --> 22:01.796
Do you have all volumes of this?

22:02.076 --> 22:04.119
It should be 488 plates.

22:04.299 --> 22:07.604
So it's all in one volume?

22:09.186 --> 22:14.013
I don't know, I haven't collected it.

22:14.253 --> 22:18.839
It should be 488 plates.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.563
But then in Petersburg, in Russia,

22:22.201 --> 22:28.009
and went on, Empress Katharina sent them out to different places.

22:29.150 --> 22:35.859
And one day they found him made in suicide by cutting off his throat.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.042
He cut his own throat.

22:38.062 --> 22:40.746
In the same time, to be sure.

22:40.786 --> 22:45.913
That was the end of Falk who named Ostermelia.

22:47.007 --> 22:50.090
We could have a short look at them.

22:50.170 --> 22:51.011
Look at the binding.

22:51.191 --> 22:55.535
I wouldn't say that it's so cute.

22:55.555 --> 22:56.456
Interesting, maybe.

22:56.776 --> 23:01.720
I write about this book and my book, how one of these was cut up and stolen.

23:01.740 --> 23:05.624
These things are worth so much.

23:05.644 --> 23:08.707
You have no idea how valuable this book is.

23:09.127 --> 23:14.432
1860 or 1860?

23:14.952 --> 23:16.915
So have you a short look at this one too?

23:16.975 --> 23:20.220
Yes, it's true.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.662
Yes, I can show you the title.

23:24.085 --> 23:34.841
It's also one of the best botanical works in the 18th century.

23:35.122 --> 23:43.474
But he was the one who discovered the best botanical painter in the whole century.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.955
And it was also Dionysus Eretz who painted for Linnaeus.

23:47.336 --> 23:49.799
We met in Hardervik.

23:51.201 --> 23:55.648
And later on at Clifford, at the camp.

23:57.892 --> 23:58.773
What year is this?

23:58.793 --> 23:59.895
This is the 18th century?

24:00.315 --> 24:00.856
Yes.

24:02.138 --> 24:11.352
And Troy, he was a mecenat for all botanical and natural history artists.

24:11.838 --> 24:13.800
in Nuremberg in Germany.

24:14.762 --> 24:25.815
So Germany became the greatest center for botanical and natural history illustration, I think, in whole Europe during the 18th century.

24:28.018 --> 24:29.059
Look at these.

24:29.079 --> 24:30.541
Spectacular.

24:30.681 --> 24:32.443
I've never seen this one before.

24:32.543 --> 24:35.086
The greatest botanical books of the 18th century.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.027
And what do they call it?

24:37.349 --> 24:40.613
Plantas, that's what I will tell you.

24:41.167 --> 24:45.112
and his name is Troy, T-R-E-W.

24:45.812 --> 24:47.154
Yeah.

24:47.274 --> 24:48.235
He was a physician.

24:49.817 --> 24:51.880
He was nothing about.

24:52.100 --> 24:57.486
And his great library went there to Irrefour, the central library, and helped.

24:57.586 --> 24:59.308
He's blessed all over the world since then.

25:00.169 --> 25:04.675
One of the greatest libraries ever since then.

25:05.516 --> 25:06.677
Yeah.

25:07.698 --> 25:10.161
Yeah.

25:10.732 --> 25:11.753
How do you change subject?

25:13.615 --> 25:31.856
This book we were talking about the Swedish enterprises in America and this book is an economical treatise, the first economical treatise in Sweden by Riesing.

25:32.336 --> 25:38.163
He was governor for a period in Delaware in New Sweden.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.945
But this was after

25:40.263 --> 25:43.050
when he had went back to Sweden.

25:48.904 --> 25:52.553
I just wrote it down, I'll check it out.

25:53.616 --> 25:57.225
This is probably one of the...

25:59.180 --> 26:00.021
What can I say?

26:00.041 --> 26:01.804
The most curious Swedish book.

26:01.924 --> 26:04.648
This is not a printed book.

26:04.748 --> 26:06.490
Is this a printed book?

26:06.510 --> 26:07.592
Yes, it's printed there.

26:07.612 --> 26:09.414
It almost looks like a manuscript, doesn't it?

26:09.795 --> 26:13.420
Yes, it's done in wood.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.321
Blocks.

26:14.421 --> 26:15.142
Blocks.

26:15.583 --> 26:17.365
Blocks.

26:17.386 --> 26:17.866
Blocks.

26:17.926 --> 26:18.267
Blocks.

26:18.367 --> 26:18.647
Blocks.

26:18.787 --> 26:19.088
Blocks.

26:19.128 --> 26:19.488
Blocks.

26:19.629 --> 26:19.829
Blocks.

26:19.849 --> 26:22.032
It's the first time since Gutenberg.

26:22.012 --> 26:24.475
with movable types, such a thing.

26:24.835 --> 26:25.416
How old is this?

26:25.436 --> 26:27.218
He was made by himself in wood.

26:27.698 --> 26:31.782
And I think he's the only example made likely in the whole world.

26:31.842 --> 26:32.924
Who is he again?

26:33.104 --> 26:36.908
In 1772, Wolfschmidt.

26:36.928 --> 26:37.969
Wolfschmidt.

26:38.009 --> 26:41.212
He's not so international now.

26:41.272 --> 26:42.093
Not at all.

26:42.454 --> 26:45.377
But this is a catalogue of his inventions.

26:47.059 --> 26:47.479
Yeah.

26:47.763 --> 26:53.212
And he was too poor that he couldn't afford to print it.

26:53.272 --> 26:55.335
Are any of these inventions with us today, do you think?

26:55.356 --> 26:57.479
A description of how to kill rats and so on.

26:57.499 --> 27:00.744
Yes, this is a rat killer.

27:00.764 --> 27:04.050
A rat here and it goes down in the water.

27:04.230 --> 27:06.133
Make a better maltrap, as they say.

27:06.574 --> 27:07.736
Yes.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.619
And...

27:10.595 --> 27:19.125
But it's also a very beautiful book.

27:19.366 --> 27:24.772
In the history of book printing, it's really unique in the world.

27:25.133 --> 27:27.255
I mean, not only... Well, what makes it unique?

27:28.297 --> 27:40.011
I mean, how you can find any book like this printed by an author himself, where all the letters are carved in letters and printed by movable types.

27:40.227 --> 28:06.707
Moveable in wood Well movable is metal so this can't be This is movable wood I understand, I get it It was made in Korea in the 14th century That's right Since that I know other examples Harvard

28:06.991 --> 28:09.438
It's a prudeness invention.

28:09.618 --> 28:11.143
How many copies of this are known?

28:11.323 --> 28:12.567
Very few of those.

28:14.171 --> 28:18.844
But it's a special book in Swedish written about this man and his copies.

28:19.205 --> 28:20.629
It was about...

28:21.368 --> 28:24.534
Five editions or six editions of his book.

28:24.554 --> 28:27.219
But it was printed by normal printers.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.945
But this is the only edition which is printed by your own types.

28:31.146 --> 28:35.053
This edition is only, I think, about three editions known.

28:35.273 --> 28:39.681
One is his, one is the Royal Library, and one is his, I'm the only two.

28:39.661 --> 28:48.212
In a most ironic way.

28:48.272 --> 28:51.596
He's not remembered for his inventions, but his book about his inventions.

28:51.616 --> 28:55.401
Yes, that's right.

28:55.421 --> 28:56.943
Piece of art.

28:56.983 --> 28:58.625
What was Wolfsmitz's first name?

28:59.927 --> 29:02.530
Wolfsmitz, he was Jacob.

29:02.797 --> 29:03.499
Pontus.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.505
And this is definitely Swedish, right?

29:06.545 --> 29:07.648
J-A-K-O-B.

29:07.768 --> 29:09.091
Yes, and Pontus.

29:09.111 --> 29:10.274
P-O-U-S.

29:10.294 --> 29:10.595
Yes.

29:11.757 --> 29:12.238
Wolfschmidt.

29:12.258 --> 29:15.085
What was the name of the song?

29:15.265 --> 29:16.047
He was Royal.

29:16.381 --> 29:26.817
Not drawing, he was... There is one collector whose name was Van Sturm in Sweden, one of the greatest during this century.

29:27.117 --> 29:35.029
He collected Bundesdolpe by Wolfschmidt in a made of great cattle and had a census of all known copies.

29:35.790 --> 29:40.597
And Wolfsch told me that at the end of that book is a summary in English.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.701
Oh really?

29:42.741 --> 29:44.363
What's the title once more of this book?

29:44.900 --> 30:10.924
It's the farmers' poll.

30:11.208 --> 30:15.433
But not as fine as you call them.

30:15.573 --> 30:16.254
It's a hemp.

30:16.394 --> 30:19.718
You could have it like a pole.

30:20.479 --> 30:25.205
A help for the farmer.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.708
A help for the farmer.

30:27.728 --> 30:30.772
Yes, farmer's helper is the idea.

30:31.172 --> 30:34.897
Have trouble.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.620
They go down and you have to rebind them.

30:38.242 --> 30:41.286
And here is an example for how we have sold that.

30:43.149 --> 30:54.263
A very good book by a woman in the south of Sweden that are rebounding the books in the paper bands, as you see here.

30:55.645 --> 31:01.633
And she chooses the color of the papers from the period they are coming from.

31:01.867 --> 31:07.494
And they are bound in the same way as books were bound for 100 and 200 years.

31:07.915 --> 31:15.865
So if you had to rebound them about 50 years or 100 years, you could do that without the, it would be any trouble.

31:16.386 --> 31:20.231
You use, for example, the old forms of the limb.

31:20.431 --> 31:20.871
Glove.

31:22.033 --> 31:23.655
Glove, yes, and so on.

31:24.327 --> 31:28.817
And you use a paper here that is by the syra.

31:28.877 --> 31:29.678
Anacetic.

31:29.698 --> 31:30.500
Yes, ethic.

31:30.681 --> 31:31.122
Exactly.

31:31.242 --> 31:31.983
And so on.

31:32.023 --> 31:37.796
So it should be... You could use it and reuse it several times.

31:39.339 --> 31:40.862
So... That's nice.

31:41.363 --> 31:41.644
Yeah.

31:42.215 --> 31:45.619
Because I think this is also an interesting and important part.

31:45.899 --> 31:47.661
You look at the old, nice books.

31:47.801 --> 31:49.744
Oh, this is a working library.

31:49.864 --> 31:53.148
Yes, that's another part of it.

31:53.248 --> 31:59.755
So you must use them in research and by... Scholars.

31:59.775 --> 32:02.759
...in Italian.

32:03.359 --> 32:05.742
And this...

32:06.295 --> 32:12.804
She then takes away, for instance, the frog wrappers, she don't cut down them.

32:13.305 --> 32:17.290
They are uncut and with wrappers in sales.

32:17.490 --> 32:20.074
So she's respecting the integrity of the boat.

32:20.134 --> 32:20.214
Yes.

32:20.314 --> 32:24.941
Even the back, see you here.

32:24.961 --> 32:25.401
Very nice.

32:25.521 --> 32:26.503
Yes.

32:28.485 --> 32:32.811
Should we have a hastily look at the who collection?

32:33.432 --> 32:33.973
The witch?

32:34.325 --> 32:48.205
They are organized so that you could find them by subject, for example.

32:48.225 --> 32:51.269
You could see the potato literature and so on.

32:51.790 --> 32:57.137
An interview about goats and so on.

32:58.098 --> 32:59.961
Veterinary science and...

33:00.852 --> 33:04.477
But even weeds and so on.

33:04.497 --> 33:06.299
Botanical literature.

33:06.319 --> 33:08.262
These are all great words for a writer.

33:08.722 --> 33:09.724
Goats, potatoes.

33:11.326 --> 33:15.411
Pure agrarian.

33:15.431 --> 33:16.232
I love it.

33:16.312 --> 33:19.657
The good thing is that even I do it.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.203
Complete body and husbandry.

33:24.483 --> 33:25.064
Yes.

33:25.725 --> 33:27.147
Taking it randomly.

33:28.488 --> 33:30.471
The interesting thing with this old...

33:30.772 --> 33:38.401
collection, it is not the Swedish part, because the royal library always has got a lot more items than we have.

33:38.942 --> 33:53.920
But we have the connection with the lot of books in English, German, and French, under the same roof, organized so you can find it, as we said earlier.

33:54.601 --> 33:57.825
That is the best quality with this old collection.

33:58.480 --> 34:02.666
And often it's only a copy of the books in Sweden.

34:02.686 --> 34:02.966
Yes.

34:05.249 --> 34:07.893
In our area.

34:10.036 --> 34:12.258
I like these compact shells.

34:12.279 --> 34:12.699
Yes.

34:12.739 --> 34:18.146
I would show you one thing here.

34:19.528 --> 34:22.672
I think that Mats picked the copies.

34:22.693 --> 34:23.494
Yes.

34:24.114 --> 34:25.817
This is me interested.

34:25.837 --> 34:26.057
This is

34:26.611 --> 34:56.297
you could say volume two doesn't matter because it is a German one, economic encyclopedia, common system of land, house and land countries, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, what heter it, science.

34:56.497 --> 34:58.479
Science, yes.

34:58.499 --> 35:00.221
This is an encyclopedia.

35:00.241 --> 35:02.563
German one, Belgians, about 1870.

35:02.703 --> 35:05.045
It comes down here, goes here.

35:05.085 --> 35:07.708
All those volumes.

35:07.908 --> 35:09.189
This one takes time.

35:09.269 --> 35:11.071
Yes, and this is the last volume here.

35:11.872 --> 35:14.754
How many years later?

35:14.774 --> 35:16.936
1850.

35:17.577 --> 35:18.838
So it's 90 years later.

35:19.178 --> 35:22.602
Tell them about the Vatican Library, that subject.

35:23.342 --> 35:24.023
You want them to see that?

35:24.374 --> 35:36.933
What I try to usually say, but mostly in Swedish, is that I use this one quite often, because it has good articles that I could use for researchers.

35:37.954 --> 35:52.997
But one time, we had a researcher in the wood history, forest history, and he was interested in that this German is called Versugflesche, this is...

35:53.180 --> 36:01.229
research areas for scientific research in forest research.

36:01.249 --> 36:04.253
It began in Eberswand in about 1840.

36:05.294 --> 36:11.882
But when I should look up it here, I didn't find it, because we haven't got every volume.

36:12.923 --> 36:15.306
So we're missing three or four volumes.

36:15.326 --> 36:17.628
So for Suslice, I couldn't find them.

36:17.668 --> 36:18.730
So this is a 90-year project.

36:18.770 --> 36:18.990
Yes.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.892
And what's the title of the project?

36:21.023 --> 36:22.745
Yes, you could look at it.

36:22.765 --> 36:24.827
1762 to 1852, right?

36:25.487 --> 36:27.109
I speak in Swedish for a while.

36:27.129 --> 36:28.870
1773?

36:28.890 --> 36:34.315
The man who told me, he will soon talk about the 200-year project they will launch.

36:34.355 --> 36:37.919
Tell them about the 200-year project that we launched.

36:38.099 --> 36:39.981
And it's a comparison.

36:40.021 --> 36:41.082
That's right, yes.

36:43.844 --> 36:49.950
But how does that translate?

36:50.183 --> 36:51.385
Dictionary.

36:51.405 --> 36:52.667
Dictionary, yes.

36:52.787 --> 36:56.232
Was this just one editor or a succession of editors?

36:56.272 --> 36:56.492
No.

36:58.975 --> 37:03.201
Several guys.

37:04.283 --> 37:10.171
Later worked on by... What project was this?

37:10.191 --> 37:11.072
What country did this?

37:11.353 --> 37:12.334
German.

37:12.514 --> 37:15.439
Yes, up to 1852.

37:15.679 --> 37:17.862
And maybe some years later.

37:18.297 --> 37:19.920
Who is the original editor?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.022
Did you get the name of that?

37:23.767 --> 37:24.087
Yes.

37:24.227 --> 37:26.151
Krizz.

37:26.171 --> 37:28.795
You can go on.

37:29.917 --> 37:30.799
K.R.

37:31.560 --> 37:37.190
German Y. N. K.R.

37:37.851 --> 37:41.217
German Y. N. I.

37:41.517 --> 37:57.955
The double S. It's S, L, F, O, S. Yeah, there's Z, Z, Z. K, U, R, I, Z. Probably that, or maybe two, double S. Double S. Double S. They have one character for that?

37:58.015 --> 37:59.556
That's right.

38:00.858 --> 38:01.058
Yes.

38:01.638 --> 38:07.204
And when we're here, we should look at something, this is more dull, but I want to speak about it later on.

38:07.565 --> 38:08.706
This is the R-sheet.

38:09.327 --> 38:19.622
But I'm going to speak about this later than we come up to the library.

38:21.604 --> 38:25.150
The good thing with this is that it's organized for research.

38:25.991 --> 38:29.416
Not beautiful, but practical.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.420
Yes, you can speak about that.

38:32.440 --> 38:36.285
We have put everything, this list and everything, out on the internet.

38:36.426 --> 38:37.427
I've done that work.

38:37.998 --> 38:40.421
So you work with this library, Nicholas?

38:40.521 --> 38:41.342
Yes, sometimes.

38:42.764 --> 38:42.924
Yes.

38:42.944 --> 38:44.526
Are we going upstairs?

38:44.706 --> 38:45.067
Yes.

38:45.147 --> 38:49.091
Is there a men's rest room down here?

38:50.133 --> 38:55.459
The whole house was rebuilt to suit the academies.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.622
When did the academy move in here?

38:59.143 --> 39:02.968
So late as 1972.

39:03.328 --> 39:03.769
I see.

39:04.036 --> 39:14.711
So we were on one address in 150 years, 17 years, and since 1972, this one.

39:15.892 --> 39:20.499
Here we have a short booklet about the academy that's not so... And it's in English too?

39:20.519 --> 39:20.719
Yes.

39:22.782 --> 39:23.143
Really?

39:23.423 --> 39:23.603
Yes.

39:24.124 --> 39:26.467
That's what helps a writer.

39:26.647 --> 39:28.690
This writer, yes.

39:29.311 --> 39:33.537
I think I should say a few words about what I'm working with here.

39:34.664 --> 39:38.630
And as I said, it's the academy looking forward in the first hand.

39:39.712 --> 39:45.080
Only, we say, 10% or something like that is looking backwards.

39:45.761 --> 40:01.144
But the academy has always been interested in its own history and the history of the agriculture and forestry that has been so important for the feeding of the population and the country's welfare.

40:02.187 --> 40:12.438
But it's only about 10 years ago since the Academy decided that this library should be specialized on the history of agriculture and forestry.

40:13.959 --> 40:19.485
And then I came in the picture, and I've been working with it since.

40:19.505 --> 40:22.809
And as we are here, I usually say that we have four legs.

40:24.731 --> 40:31.738
And that one is a library for research and history things.

40:32.478 --> 40:37.824
It is the archive, it's the publication, and it's the network.

40:40.006 --> 40:49.857
The library, here we are sitting in the library room, here you look at this from the Nordic countries printed after 1850.

40:51.179 --> 41:02.451
We also have already seen the old collection, but the great collection, I think you should avoid because we don't have to run around the house too much, you find it in the attic.

41:03.832 --> 41:10.783
And we have a lot of literature about time, about the times when things were new.

41:12.326 --> 41:20.800
But what we, the last 10 years, we are buying literature about old times, as we call secondary literature.

41:20.820 --> 41:26.970
And I've placed some around here, so you only could hastily look at.

41:27.490 --> 41:53.751
maybe especially those ones that are some pieces from our bibliography or graphical collection so and we about say between 80 and 90 percent quality there whereby are in english french and german and the

41:54.102 --> 41:57.647
Only a few percent is in Swedish because it's a little published.

41:58.208 --> 42:01.794
So we buy some Danish, some Finnish, and Swedish, of course.

42:02.395 --> 42:13.792
And we try to buy a lot of, not only in English, that is the most common second language here, but also in German and French.

42:14.493 --> 42:20.683
So the researchers could find somewhere in the country a good collection in their something.

42:21.997 --> 42:35.636
And all the literature we are cataloging in the international electronic data catalog, Libris, that is the home is in the Royal Library.

42:35.656 --> 42:50.957
So while you are sitting in the country, you could by internet go in in this Libris and see all the books that are in the research libraries and you'll sometimes find the letter

42:51.747 --> 42:57.614
Or G, that is the A, sorry, this library.

42:57.634 --> 43:04.262
So then you could order the book if you're sitting in the south of Sweden, north of Sweden, or somewhere else.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.784
But not to post a restante.

43:06.224 --> 43:09.528
No, only if you have a good address yourself.

43:10.590 --> 43:17.919
So I think that you could use only a few minutes, go around and see.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.742
I want to pick out the English,

43:21.228 --> 43:24.673
language with books here taken down from the attic.

43:24.693 --> 43:26.676
So you can see what sort of books we are buying.

43:28.178 --> 43:32.584
And the second leg is, as I said, the archive.

43:33.826 --> 43:50.290
And it is not only the Academy's archive, but only up to the, from 1811 to about 1920, it was a collection of the development of the

43:50.641 --> 43:52.884
agriculture and forestry in all the country.

43:53.845 --> 43:59.171
So it's more interesting than you could think in the first time.

44:00.873 --> 44:02.595
So it's used a lot of research.

44:03.597 --> 44:11.626
The third is that we are publishing... The library has its own historical theory.

44:17.193 --> 44:18.775
For example...

44:19.987 --> 44:21.188
So you do those?

44:21.208 --> 44:23.471
Yes.

44:23.491 --> 44:49.757
And we always try to find the sort of individuality that makes it a sort of mixture between humanism and the history, the ordinary history on one side, and the people working with the natural sciences on the other side, a sort of mixture.

44:50.986 --> 44:55.291
And mostly they are in Swedish.

44:55.752 --> 44:58.014
Some articles are only in English.

44:58.034 --> 45:01.679
Usually a collection of essays.

45:01.919 --> 45:02.239
Pardon?

45:02.259 --> 45:04.822
Usually a collection of essays.

45:05.123 --> 45:07.305
Yes, usually.

45:07.405 --> 45:08.967
It's probably a quarterly.

45:09.588 --> 45:11.490
No, it's not a quarterly.

45:11.991 --> 45:15.094
It gives out about six volumes a year.

45:15.114 --> 45:15.255
Really?

45:15.275 --> 45:17.617
You give six a year?

45:17.878 --> 45:18.158
Yes.

45:18.543 --> 45:28.674
And just now we have changed, going down to smaller size and hard bound, so more looking as a book.

45:31.337 --> 45:32.979
And who are the buyers?

45:33.019 --> 45:39.285
The buyers are, of course, the researchers of several parts of history.

45:40.447 --> 45:46.373
And, as I said, even researchers of modern science in our areas.

45:46.758 --> 45:50.682
that are interested to see how things develop earlier.

45:53.124 --> 46:16.326
So, for example, this one, in two volumes, it is about how you use leaves and small parts of trees for feeding creatures.

46:17.723 --> 46:20.147
We have sold in 1,400 cuppes.

46:21.729 --> 46:22.270
Impressive.

46:22.290 --> 46:23.391
Yes, 100 cuppes.

46:23.692 --> 46:24.052
1,400.

46:24.092 --> 46:25.374
1,400.

46:25.474 --> 46:27.457
Using leaves and what else?

46:28.038 --> 46:30.461
In Swedish.

46:30.642 --> 46:35.629
I think we have some articles in English so you could see.

46:37.532 --> 46:38.233
One moment.

46:38.313 --> 46:40.356
200 just to build that connection.

46:40.376 --> 46:41.858
But that article is in Swedish.

46:41.973 --> 46:42.253
No?

46:43.735 --> 46:46.800
History of traces and chopping or polluting in Scania's house.

46:47.060 --> 46:47.861
Shrapping and collect?

46:47.921 --> 46:48.582
No, I used to.

46:49.183 --> 46:59.277
Here, you can find one English... No, no, that's an article in 90 pages, so that's not an abstract.

46:59.357 --> 47:02.241
History and traces of... I don't even know.

47:02.281 --> 47:04.103
History and traces of... Coppicing.

47:04.123 --> 47:04.604
Coppicing, yeah.

47:04.624 --> 47:07.508
C-O-P-P-I-C-I-N-G-L-O-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R-I-R

47:07.808 --> 47:09.150
and pollarding.

47:09.190 --> 47:11.493
I don't know that one either.

47:11.754 --> 47:13.236
P-O-L-I-N-E-R.

47:13.977 --> 47:20.006
Those two volumes deals about how you could use trees for agriculture.

47:21.027 --> 47:25.934
Feeding, for example, for houseboundry and so on.

47:26.816 --> 47:28.338
Of course, these must be fallen trees.

47:28.859 --> 47:31.743
You cut them.

47:32.103 --> 47:33.145
Cut them.

47:33.565 --> 47:35.368
And use, dry it.

47:35.652 --> 47:41.159
and feed the cows and the horses and so on during the winter.

47:41.179 --> 47:43.602
I see.

47:45.144 --> 47:49.650
Even in Britain and so on, but mostly in the northern countries.

47:49.670 --> 47:54.377
I would think so, because in my country, trees are becoming very scarce now.

47:54.397 --> 47:59.764
They're making it very much difficult to harvest trees.

48:00.565 --> 48:01.626
Yeah.

48:02.433 --> 48:07.599
The last examples were directly after the Second World War.

48:08.440 --> 48:13.607
And back from the Stone Age.

48:13.847 --> 48:14.488
Oh, I see.

48:14.548 --> 48:16.831
So that's not guidance for what to do now.

48:16.851 --> 48:18.513
No, no, no, nothing.

48:18.733 --> 48:21.136
That's what I was saying.

48:21.156 --> 48:31.309
Different examples, and how they change the landscapes, how trees develop, and how people use trees in different ways in agriculture.

48:31.762 --> 48:33.524
They're only one example.

48:34.305 --> 48:45.018
There are others, for example, if I should, for example, we are publishing old manuscripts about veterinary sciences.

48:45.038 --> 48:50.805
They comment in different ways and so on.

48:50.905 --> 48:52.567
But that's our third leg.

48:52.867 --> 48:59.575
And the fourth leg is, as I said, it is network to promote and work for people

49:00.263 --> 49:05.650
So our interest in historical questions works just with agricultural historical questions.

49:05.670 --> 49:17.366
And we have a network around in Scandinavia at first hand and even in other countries to get the interest of those questions to rise.

49:18.167 --> 49:19.068
Keep them informed.

49:20.009 --> 49:21.772
Keep them informed.

49:21.992 --> 49:28.060
We are having seminars and symposiums and we are publishing even other titles and those and so on.

49:29.710 --> 49:37.658
to have a focus on this question.

49:38.158 --> 49:45.125
And the academy is paying itself for this library and all this work is coming from the academy's pocket.

49:45.425 --> 49:58.198
So this is a private library and it comes from the nations as the academy lives on private money itself.

49:58.887 --> 50:03.314
And the academy is probably generally funded by the farmers, by the agriculture.

50:03.454 --> 50:04.055
No, no.

50:04.415 --> 50:06.558
No rents from donations.

50:06.779 --> 50:09.142
Yes, we are living on rents from donations.

50:09.523 --> 50:10.945
So we are a free academy.

50:11.706 --> 50:22.522
Therefore, I could, for example, in my way, I could always choose which books I want to give out or which books I want to buy.

50:22.582 --> 50:28.050
The Collegium are interested in

50:28.537 --> 50:39.314
that things are developing in a good way, but there are free hands to organize the work or the library.

50:39.334 --> 50:53.576
And we are, it depends on your count, but we are a few persons that are working here for full time and some on projects.

50:55.539 --> 50:56.400
And this...

50:56.667 --> 50:57.689
Yes, of course.

50:57.729 --> 51:02.276
These publications are usually paying for themselves.

51:02.577 --> 51:02.857
Yes.

51:02.997 --> 51:05.702
About even or a bit better.

51:05.842 --> 51:12.513
We are looking for monies in other donations and so on, and we are selling them.

51:13.053 --> 51:14.636
Because we are not giving them away.

51:14.936 --> 51:23.991
Because if people are not interested to buy them for the sum, we don't think they have the right interest.

51:25.760 --> 51:32.990
So those 1,400, about a very old subject, they are to 95% are sold.

51:34.512 --> 51:48.450
And that, for example, if you go back to it for a short moment, sorry, you could see we joined a lot of organizations here that were spreading inside that organization.

51:51.034 --> 51:55.159
And there are historical organizations and there are organizations you

51:55.342 --> 51:58.945
Working with the landscape and so on.

51:59.546 --> 52:01.988
And environmental organizations.

52:02.008 --> 52:05.931
Would these publications work without the library?

52:06.071 --> 52:20.304
I mean, what's the connection between the library and the... It is that, as I said a bit earlier, that we are... Our first aim is not to get people to borrow books or visit us.

52:20.364 --> 52:25.348
It is to promote the studies, the research, or the history of the culture.

52:26.037 --> 52:31.965
So all those four things are mixed together in different ways.

52:31.985 --> 52:41.217
And it's quite often that we are promoting some researching that with them giving out in one text earlier, and then later on.

52:43.180 --> 52:48.187
So this does not exactly build on the library, but it's at the same level.

52:48.367 --> 52:50.970
Yes, this section of the academy.

52:51.852 --> 52:55.977
We are mixing with those four legs or divisions.

52:58.505 --> 53:00.948
It's a library concept.

53:00.968 --> 53:01.949
Yes, it is.

53:02.270 --> 53:04.352
This is a way to survive.

53:04.612 --> 53:06.174
This is to be small but beautiful.

53:06.455 --> 53:13.804
Do you know anything to compare with?

53:13.824 --> 53:17.548
Yes, this is basically an introduction for me.

53:18.249 --> 53:27.921
But we have a sort of big brother here in Sweden in the technical university.

53:28.238 --> 53:31.642
Technological University, they have a historical part.

53:32.243 --> 53:44.857
And from this part, they have grown up a whole institution for studying the history of technology and those sorts of sciences.

53:45.138 --> 53:46.940
Yes.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.102
But we are only a small brother.

53:52.627 --> 53:58.093
Yes, that's what I think I would mention about what I'm doing.

53:59.980 --> 54:02.123
I see Jacob Pontes from Wolfson.

54:02.143 --> 54:06.709
Yes, this is an abstract of a bibliographical... It's an English summary.

54:06.970 --> 54:09.833
Yes, an English summary.

54:09.854 --> 54:20.728
I think this is something which could be very interesting because it's a unique example of missing the book of the title in the 18th century.

54:21.369 --> 54:22.631
Did you have a title?

54:22.651 --> 54:22.911
Yes.

54:23.492 --> 54:28.519
Thank you.

54:29.073 --> 54:35.051
It's about one o'clock.

54:35.192 --> 54:41.310
I don't know.

54:41.915 --> 54:46.883
I've got a car coming in to 30.

54:46.923 --> 54:52.512
I've got a car coming in to 30.

54:52.592 --> 55:00.565
I've got a car coming in to 30.

55:00.950 --> 55:27.733
We're an integrated bookseller, right?

55:27.967 --> 55:31.591
These aren't books for sale or anything like that.

55:31.911 --> 55:33.953
You're performing a bibliographical service here.

55:34.013 --> 55:34.694
These are not for sale.

55:34.774 --> 55:36.296
Researcher and consultant.

55:37.036 --> 55:37.417
Yes, yes.

55:39.099 --> 55:40.500
I'm a consultant.

55:40.760 --> 55:47.808
Here you see a copy of Paracelsus, which had belonged to Adam.

55:48.248 --> 55:57.838
And your copy of Palmberg, the first Swedish book on Swedish Herber, Illustrated Herber.

55:58.207 --> 56:00.269
It was also Hohen's copy.

56:00.289 --> 56:22.695
He had a really tremendous... As a bookseller, is this man a model for professional...

56:24.093 --> 56:35.849
The commentaries are a bit long to be in a booksellers catalogue, I think, but Ovid does a booksellers catalogue of that kind.

56:36.290 --> 56:39.374
And do you do a tremendous amount of research for each of these books?

56:39.394 --> 56:39.755
Yes, of course.

56:39.775 --> 56:41.036
And your own reference library?

56:41.056 --> 56:41.136
Yes.

56:41.837 --> 56:48.467
But you think you said there's about 30,000 or 40,000 volumes, is that what you said earlier?

56:48.487 --> 56:50.269
Yes, I have a lot of reference libraries.

56:51.177 --> 57:20.610
My first catalogue for the Karolinska Institute I started with one of the greatest exhibitions ever after the war I think on the Royal Library It was filled up with old anatomical books with hand-cutted plates

57:20.995 --> 57:27.602
from woodcut, from copper plates, from hand-coloured lithographs, up to photography.

57:28.183 --> 57:29.985
And this is an exhibition catalogue.

57:30.125 --> 57:32.428
I can send that also, but this is in Swedish.

57:33.229 --> 57:35.191
So why did you decide to do these in English?

57:36.933 --> 57:43.741
I sell about 2% of the catalogues in Sweden, the rest of the other world.

57:44.041 --> 57:48.446
There are very few people interested in old books in Sweden.

57:48.466 --> 57:49.467
It's better released?

57:49.733 --> 57:53.138
advanced level, for some reason.

57:53.158 --> 57:56.422
It would be a ruin to publish in Swedish.

57:56.863 --> 57:58.565
I would sell no copy at all.

57:58.846 --> 58:02.210
But now, these books aren't meant for sale, though.

58:02.491 --> 58:03.112
The catalogs?

58:03.132 --> 58:07.458
No, the books are not for sale, which I described, but the catalogs are for sale.

58:08.219 --> 58:19.234
I have a small part of the edition, but it's sold by the Swedish Society of Medicine and the Karolinska Institute and the Gymnastic Institute and the Pharmaceutical Society.

58:19.990 --> 58:24.096
But I think I bought from them most of the books.

58:24.917 --> 58:33.629
And because I have got many orders, because I have about 30 book reviews of each in international press.

58:35.010 --> 58:37.814
Michelin, magnificent.

58:37.834 --> 58:47.888
Bulletin of the History of Medicine, the British Journal of History of Medicine and so on, Medical History from Wellcome Institute and so on.

58:48.695 --> 58:59.429
And also many from Italy and Switzerland and Germany and so on, but very, very, very little interest from Sweden.

59:01.692 --> 59:02.974
But yet you've got beautiful books.

59:04.556 --> 59:06.638
It's kind of a paradox, isn't it?

59:07.660 --> 59:10.603
Yes, would it take to take some with?

59:11.905 --> 59:13.087
This one?

59:13.107 --> 59:14.128
But I can send the others.

59:14.480 --> 59:16.225
I'd love to take one of them either on the airplane.

59:16.286 --> 59:20.178
You would like to take them because they're rather heavy to have as a hand.

59:20.338 --> 59:22.304
So would you inscribe this one to me?

59:22.324 --> 59:22.465
Yes.

59:23.648 --> 59:27.460
Tit for tat.
