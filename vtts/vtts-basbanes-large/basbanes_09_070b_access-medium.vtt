WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:03.761
Okay.

00:03.941 --> 00:09.246
You know, you're a wonderful writer and a stylist.

00:09.847 --> 00:12.950
Can I have to hear your own question?

00:12.970 --> 00:13.030
No.

00:13.170 --> 00:13.510
Okay.

00:13.590 --> 00:23.000
I get the sense that you're an explorer as much as a writer.

00:23.060 --> 00:25.642
I use writing as a way to celebrate and to explore the world.

00:28.305 --> 00:33.210
It takes me out into undiscovered landscapes and

00:33.730 --> 00:40.637
into... Hi, how are you today?

00:40.757 --> 00:41.858
Hi there.

00:41.878 --> 00:45.682
Would you like to have?

00:47.044 --> 00:49.386
I'd like some iced tea with some regular milk to put in.

00:50.507 --> 00:51.348
Some milk?

00:51.368 --> 00:51.468
Sure.

00:51.729 --> 00:56.253
Um, I have a Bloody Mary if I saw it with you.

00:56.273 --> 00:56.534
I don't mind.

00:56.554 --> 00:56.794
Bloody Mary?

00:56.814 --> 00:56.914
Yeah.

00:56.934 --> 00:57.034
Fine.

00:57.054 --> 00:57.154
Fine.

00:57.174 --> 00:57.555
Okay?

00:57.575 --> 00:57.675
Okay.

00:57.695 --> 00:58.155
Good, I'm sorry.

00:58.175 --> 00:58.355
Okay.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.377
In fact, what I'm discovered with landscapes.

01:00.397 --> 01:02.860
Uh, I think, I think what I said was

01:03.683 --> 01:12.275
It's probably that writing for me plays a couple of roles, both a form of celebration and inquiry.

01:13.276 --> 01:18.183
It's the way that I learn about the world, and it's a form of prayer.

01:19.665 --> 01:22.449
That's wonderful.

01:22.469 --> 01:25.253
I guess your publisher is...

01:25.942 --> 01:29.907
promoting it as a bookend almost.

01:30.547 --> 01:32.670
It is a companion book.

01:32.710 --> 01:34.091
I call it a companion book.

01:34.512 --> 01:42.100
I wonder if you could just tell me a little bit about how you moved so effortlessly into this book from that one.

01:42.781 --> 01:45.765
Well, the truth is that I was thinking about both books at the same time.

01:46.626 --> 01:53.974
And they're companion books in the most human and intimate sense.

01:54.258 --> 02:01.867
Even the women who are on the covers of the book seem to know each other and belong to the same emotional family.

02:04.691 --> 02:23.033
It's very hard to think about the senses and not think about love, which is a delicious expression of the senses, or to think about love and not think of all of the sensual treats that are in store for lovers.

02:23.182 --> 02:25.245
One is really just an extension of the other.

02:26.647 --> 02:50.539
But if you want to know how it is that I decided to do both of these books, I think as much as anything it's that I realized at some point that in order to understand the human condition, I was going to need to study how we perceive the world and also the most important emotion in the history of humankind, the one emotion

02:50.958 --> 03:08.081
that is central to the lives of absolutely everyone who's ever lived, or will ever live probably, and everybody on earth, no matter what their culture is, their age, their customs, one thing we know about them absolutely is that they feel love and that it is central to their lives.

03:08.822 --> 03:14.890
Whereas the natural history of the senses took in all of the senses,

03:18.329 --> 03:20.291
We will not take in all of the emotions here.

03:21.592 --> 03:22.693
Love is a large topic.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.895
Well, actually, the senses.

03:25.475 --> 03:27.477
That's a large topic, too.

03:27.497 --> 03:33.102
The perfect book about love would have to take from birth to death to write and include all of consciousness.

03:33.122 --> 03:38.126
So, of course, I had to select what was going to be important.

03:38.146 --> 03:43.591
But I'm interested in love in the most panoramic sense.

03:43.611 --> 03:48.235
I'm not interested in one argument about love or...

03:49.868 --> 03:53.152
questions just for monogamy or other such things.

03:53.192 --> 03:58.518
There are research scientists working in the field who are handling that very well.

03:59.740 --> 04:16.720
I've been interested in the large, rich festival of love, that is, the history of love, the psychology, the great ideas that people have had about love through the ages, and science.

04:17.138 --> 04:29.191
And in that, the chemistry, the anthropology, the neurophysiology, special topics of neuroticism that intrigue people, women and horses, men and mermaids, and things like that.

04:29.412 --> 04:36.079
Every mother and father of a 10-year-old horse-crazy girl wants to know what on earth is going on.

04:37.180 --> 04:43.027
And also, varieties of love, besides romantic love.

04:44.048 --> 04:45.930
Most of the book is about romantic love.

04:46.400 --> 04:55.614
But there are so many different complexions of love that we don't give enough prestige.

04:56.455 --> 04:56.796
Thank you.

04:57.657 --> 04:58.999
This is milk, right?

05:02.785 --> 05:03.586
That is milk.

05:03.827 --> 05:10.737
There are many complexions of love that obscure us and obsess us

05:11.594 --> 05:15.618
and greatly alter and improve the quality of our lives.

05:16.238 --> 05:19.982
But we tend not to give them the same prestige as we do romantic love.

05:20.963 --> 05:23.325
But they're so important that I decided to write about them too.

05:23.846 --> 05:34.656
And so I wrote about religious love, love of pets, altruistic love, transference love, different topics.

05:34.676 --> 05:37.939
I actually have people in my book who are loved.

05:38.290 --> 05:39.392
their books.

05:39.492 --> 05:46.702
I mean, Elias Kennedy's book, Otto Defei, did you read that novel?

05:46.722 --> 05:54.533
I mean, the man actually has almost a sexual experience as he spoke of these books and he's about to lose them.

05:54.553 --> 05:59.780
You know, I think people are actually making proclamations of love to books.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.965
There's a new book about collecting, about the psychology of collecting.

06:02.985 --> 06:04.186
Yeah, I have it.

06:04.207 --> 06:05.468
It's Princeton University.

06:05.488 --> 06:07.992
I got it in time to footnote it.

06:08.012 --> 06:08.112
Yeah.

06:08.277 --> 06:18.186
I think that collectors very often get into a kind of erotic of what they are collecting, and that's not a bad thing.

06:18.206 --> 06:28.917
Well, of course, if it's scary to excess, if anything, I mean, when they go over the cliff, then you have this wonderfully bizarre behavior.

06:29.017 --> 06:33.581
I guess it's certainly not limited to books.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.943
Yes, but that's not the kind of love that I'm writing about.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.845
The kind of love I need.

06:38.416 --> 06:46.389
is love between people, and that can be of many different sorts.

06:47.510 --> 06:53.981
It could be gay love, it could be heterosexual love, it could be love as parent for child, or brother-sister love.

06:54.001 --> 07:01.032
There are many versions of love that are different.

07:01.315 --> 07:03.677
With one exception, which is the love of pets.

07:03.697 --> 07:04.658
The love of pets?

07:04.678 --> 07:04.978
Yes.

07:04.998 --> 07:08.081
You mean the human love of pets or the pets?

07:11.144 --> 07:11.484
Yes.

07:11.604 --> 07:15.628
People wonder whether or not a dog can love.

07:15.788 --> 07:20.272
I look in my labrador retriever's eyes.

07:20.292 --> 07:21.253
Total devotion.

07:21.273 --> 07:22.834
And she loves me.

07:22.854 --> 07:27.198
I think we underestimate the emotional lives of animals.

07:27.258 --> 07:30.141
I've spent part of my life as a naturalist in the field.

07:30.610 --> 07:37.700
And I've seen animals express so many shades of emotion.

07:38.661 --> 07:48.935
It may be that our problem-solving abilities are better and our lives are more elaborate and our emotional lives are more complex and more hidden.

07:50.077 --> 07:59.149
But anyone who owns a dog or a cat knows what true devotion really is and a certain kind of obsessive love.

07:59.838 --> 08:03.683
that is unconditional and wonderful.

08:04.084 --> 08:10.413
In fact, I think that's part of why we become so deeply fond of our pets.

08:10.893 --> 08:16.621
They function as children in our families, but especially exempt children.

08:17.082 --> 08:25.153
We give them names, but we withhold our criticisms and our expectations.

08:25.673 --> 08:30.420
We don't expect them to live on our time, as we do with babies.

08:30.440 --> 08:37.912
We don't expect them to grow up and fulfill our private fantasies of being a baseball player, a dancer, or something like that.

08:40.376 --> 08:46.005
They don't argue with us or want to borrow the car or go out with somebody we don't approve of.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.188
They are like children, and they even...

08:49.113 --> 09:00.768
sometimes have facial qualities that remind us of children, especially of babies, but we make great allowances for them.

09:01.870 --> 09:17.550
I decided that I would

09:19.218 --> 09:34.875
trace the history of love from our oldest writings about it up to the modern day in order to see the ways in which love has changed over the different eras.

09:34.895 --> 09:45.707
And then I would have a good look at the psychology of love and the great thoughts about love and science and all the different aspects of love as well.

09:46.749 --> 09:48.010
When I was looking at the history,

09:48.631 --> 09:57.441
I was surprised to find that we feel exactly the same sort of love that our most ancient ancestors did.

09:57.461 --> 10:00.604
We even use the same language to talk about love.

10:00.644 --> 10:10.435
If you look at the ancient hieroglyphic love poem, 53 of which remain... Which is kind of a surprise.

10:10.455 --> 10:10.536
Yes.

10:10.556 --> 10:11.837
We tend to think of it.

10:12.442 --> 10:33.462
We tend to think that love itself was invested with the Greeks and that romantic love reached its height in the Middle Ages during courtly love.

10:33.482 --> 10:39.748
But the truth is that the ancient lovers felt just what we feel today.

10:40.150 --> 10:44.074
They say that they are experiencing lovesickness.

10:44.094 --> 10:46.356
They say that they're on fire inside.

10:47.137 --> 10:53.304
Bruce Springsteen writes in his songs, I'm on fire, but that's what the ancient poets said also.

10:54.685 --> 11:08.419
They are full of the same neuroses and fantasies and obsessions and exhilarations and insecurities and uncertainties and hopes and dreams as contemporary lovers are.

11:08.821 --> 11:09.862
the same delirium.

11:11.724 --> 11:23.539
And so I can only assume that love evolved as an important biological mechanism to make sure that the species survived.

11:24.380 --> 11:28.765
And you can ask yourself, why was that necessary?

11:28.785 --> 11:38.136
There can only be one answer, that we were such an aggressive and destructive species that we needed love as a peacemaking force.

11:38.437 --> 11:41.361
Of course, it could be separated from pleasure, too.

11:41.381 --> 11:42.482
Yes.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.203
But that's true.

11:43.924 --> 11:56.221
Pleasure is not going to be enough to keep peace among people long enough for children to be born and raised and so on.

11:56.241 --> 11:58.343
I'm not even sure that that's true.

11:59.064 --> 12:01.748
You know, you're not going to get very successful.

12:01.768 --> 12:03.731
We don't have love on the rest of the animal.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.836
Well, bear in mind that children stay dependent on

12:08.322 --> 12:09.483
for a very long time.

12:09.523 --> 12:13.627
When children are born, it's as if they're fetuses really outside of the body.

12:14.348 --> 12:28.062
They still are completely helpless and dependent for years until they're really on the ground and walking successfully by themselves and would be able to run away from predators.

12:28.122 --> 12:35.730
They require a lot of looking after, and there has to be some force that would persuade a mother

12:36.048 --> 12:41.015
to stay with that child and protect it and make sacrifices for it during that critical period.

12:41.035 --> 12:45.260
And also, at least on some occasions, for a father to want to protect it too.

12:45.521 --> 12:50.347
And that force, that reward, is love.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.490
It absolutely is.

12:52.510 --> 12:59.700
I was interested as well in your examination of the chemical, these chemicals that are involved.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.062
That's new to me.

13:01.082 --> 13:02.564
Yep, that was fascinating to discover too.

13:03.405 --> 13:04.266
Because love is...

13:04.567 --> 13:09.912
a completely natural, automatic experience of the body.

13:11.313 --> 13:13.576
There are chemicals that come into play.

13:14.436 --> 13:29.271
There are chemicals that flow when one is deep in infatuation, when infatuation turns to a long-term, quieter, but more enduring love of a companion.

13:30.832 --> 13:31.873
There are chemicals

13:32.056 --> 13:37.885
that builds up in a woman just before she gives birth.

13:38.806 --> 13:41.811
We're back on.

13:42.091 --> 13:49.683
We're making a good point, as I recall.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.444
Chemicals.

13:51.466 --> 13:54.811
Ah, chemicals.

13:54.831 --> 14:00.780
When people fall in love, an amphetamine-like chemical drenches their body.

14:01.638 --> 14:12.610
And that's why lovers could stay up all night talking and making love, and they seem to be on a high, and they feel completely blissed out by love.

14:13.251 --> 14:14.793
It's a chemical bliss.

14:14.813 --> 14:25.424
The body is stirring them to mate with the person that they're falling in love with and really feel attached to that person long enough to have a child.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.708
When...

14:29.431 --> 14:45.090
When a couple has been together over a longer period of time, over a few years, let's say, past the time when they indeed would have had a child, and their child would already be on the ground and walking, then another set of chemicals takes over.

14:45.811 --> 14:47.433
The endorphins do.

14:48.133 --> 14:50.476
And they're the chemicals of calm and reassurance.

14:51.177 --> 14:57.885
So, yes, infatuation is very seductive, but there is something equally seductive,

14:58.321 --> 15:06.390
about the sense of security and peacefulness that long-term spouses feel when they're together.

15:06.410 --> 15:09.834
And that's because of another set of chemicals that takes over.

15:09.914 --> 15:13.297
You found that this is actual research.

15:13.317 --> 15:13.397
Yes.

15:13.417 --> 15:19.284
Have there been any studies to indicate what might happen if there's an imbalance in these chemicals, if there's too much or not enough?

15:19.304 --> 15:20.645
Well, that's a good question.

15:20.745 --> 15:24.109
You know, I've often wondered,

15:24.224 --> 15:27.307
what the chemical situation of autism is.

15:28.087 --> 15:40.819
Here are people who are so isolated from the rest of humanity that I wonder if there is a failure of some of these chemicals in them.

15:40.839 --> 15:44.262
For example, too low a level of oxytocin, maybe.

15:44.402 --> 15:52.189
Oxytocin, which has been called the cuddle chemical, reaches very high levels in women just before they give birth.

15:52.557 --> 16:22.497
it has to because there is so much stress involved in being pregnant and there's going to be the pain of birth and the baby is going to be immediately so dependent that the best the best thing for the woman is if she can instantly feel an overwhelming sense of love and a desire to cuddle her baby and that's what happens the oxytocin level rises very very high in the

16:23.050 --> 16:51.589
studies that they've done with all kinds of animals when they raise the oxytocin level the animals become wonderful parents and they cuddle and they kiss their offspring and they raise affectionate and when the level is artificially lowered they have no interest in that so we know that it's associated with affection we know that it goes up much higher during lovemaking and especially higher in women and some people feel that that's why women especially

16:51.873 --> 16:59.586
like to cuddle after sex because this cuddle chemical has risen very, very high inside of them.

17:03.052 --> 17:13.830
Again, you certainly want to try and comfort everything.

17:13.850 --> 17:16.294
I don't try to be all inclusive.

17:16.527 --> 17:29.362
because no book about love could be... Ah, well, yes, I do bring in many different avenues of thought and feeling because I'm interested in them.

17:29.382 --> 17:37.391
I'll start learning about the history of something, and that will lead me to think about psychology, and that might lead me to think about the chemistry.

17:37.752 --> 17:41.356
And before I know it, I'm thinking back about some related customs.

17:42.277 --> 17:45.741
And the whole book really has...

17:46.058 --> 18:01.778
evolved as a fascinating journey for me in which I've been learning about love in many different aspects of our lives.

18:02.138 --> 18:08.286
Do you set out to learn yourself and educate yourself on other subjects?

18:08.306 --> 18:10.949
Go back to my initial question about the process of exploration and discovery.

18:10.969 --> 18:13.112
I only ever set out to satisfy my own curiosity.

18:13.379 --> 18:14.300
when I'm writing a book.

18:15.221 --> 18:20.726
I love hearing from readers that something that I've written has spoken to them intimately.

18:21.967 --> 18:26.231
I love when readers write to me and share their experiences with me.

18:27.813 --> 18:32.157
It's important for me to feel a sense of community and belonging.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.259
It is for all writers.

18:34.279 --> 18:41.226
But I'm really not thinking about any of that when I'm passionately involved in writing a book.

18:41.611 --> 18:57.096
At that point, I'm so obsessed with the subject and the desire to learn more about it that it really is a kind of romance in itself.

18:57.116 --> 19:02.124
And do you start off with any... I mean, clearly the chemical thing must have just come your way.

19:02.144 --> 19:07.753
But from my work on the senses, I've always been interested in...

19:08.003 --> 19:14.751
the chemistry of mood and personality and actions.

19:14.771 --> 19:18.435
I'm as interested in science as I am in art and always have been.

19:18.455 --> 19:20.838
I was as a graduate student even.

19:20.878 --> 19:25.424
I was doing an interdisciplinary degree in the sciences and the arts.

19:27.126 --> 19:34.855
So it's very hard for me to say at what stage I become interested in the science as opposed to something else.

19:35.307 --> 19:41.192
All of it interests me at the same time.

19:41.553 --> 19:43.134
Were there any other surprises for you?

19:43.154 --> 19:44.756
In every chapter.

19:44.776 --> 19:48.379
It was a surprise to learn of love's antiquity.

19:49.500 --> 20:02.952
It was a surprise to learn about the real Cleopatra, or the real Casanova, or what Beethoven's life was really like, or Ben Franklin's, various other people that we have misconceptions about.

20:04.012 --> 20:09.257
It was a surprise to learn about the chemistry of love.

20:09.277 --> 20:18.785
It was a surprise to learn the very special and ancient relationship between women and horses.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.430
Every chapter contains some extraordinary surprises.

20:23.450 --> 20:28.754
Do you have an explanation for that, for women and horses?

20:28.855 --> 20:33.799
I think as all parents of ten-year-old horse maniacs know,

20:34.285 --> 20:42.416
At a certain stage of a girl's development, horses come to embody their sexuality in some profound way.

20:42.436 --> 20:52.871
Not that the girls want to have sex with the horses, although the experience of riding is very sexy at a time when the girls might not even have a name for what they're feeling.

20:54.713 --> 21:03.145
But horses allow girls to perfect themselves at a time when girls don't have a lot of self-confidence,

21:03.243 --> 21:10.136
aren't very strong, aren't sure exactly what is happening to them and how to be with other people.

21:11.378 --> 21:25.926
They can mount up a very forceful, atavistic creature of nature and control it, and it gives their lives a sense of nurturing,

21:26.227 --> 21:29.091
and power and control that they wouldn't have in any other way.

21:29.651 --> 21:31.534
So I think that's one element to it.

21:32.214 --> 21:33.456
There's psychological reasons.

21:33.476 --> 21:36.239
There's sociological reasons.

21:36.259 --> 21:44.409
But the main thing is that the relationship between women and horses goes back very, very far to the ancient horse worship cults throughout Europe.

21:44.850 --> 21:53.140
Do you think there's any significance in this?

21:53.160 --> 21:53.581
Do you remember that?

21:53.601 --> 21:54.202
A lady with right side saddle?

21:54.222 --> 21:54.362
Mm-hmm.

21:54.382 --> 21:55.423
Women...

21:55.876 --> 22:02.269
had to ride side saddle because it was quite indelicate for a woman to have anything as powerful as a horse between her legs.

22:03.291 --> 22:17.479
But it was very awkward for the woman, not just because it was easy to tumble off backwards, but how on earth did she have her clothes fitted, given the fact that one leg was always going to be held up shorter than the other leg?

22:17.915 --> 22:20.238
And that is, in fact, what had to happen.

22:20.298 --> 22:26.906
She would go to a seamstress, and she would have her pantaloons done short on one leg and long on the other leg.

22:26.986 --> 22:28.368
It was extremely awkward.

22:28.869 --> 22:29.249
For her.

22:29.850 --> 22:32.974
But as I say, it was considered indelicate to ride in any other way.

22:32.994 --> 22:39.542
And on the other hand, very risque for her to ride.

22:39.562 --> 22:39.963
At all.

22:39.983 --> 22:40.664
At all.

22:40.684 --> 22:44.528
That's quite dangerous.

22:44.548 --> 22:46.551
It's not so easy to jump sides, though.

22:46.571 --> 22:47.432
I think so.

22:47.800 --> 22:54.129
Tell me, do you plan to continue these natural history explorations?

22:54.149 --> 23:02.540
The next book out will be a book of nature essays about some very endangered animals that I went out to find.

23:03.462 --> 23:04.703
It's called The Rarest of the Rare.

23:04.723 --> 23:12.314
It'll be out next year sometime, probably towards the end of the year, but I don't know exactly when.

23:12.394 --> 23:15.478
And I've been spending time traveling around the world finding some of the

23:16.049 --> 23:22.635
most endangered animals, and just writing about them, celebrating them, witnessing them, describing them before they disappear.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.957
So that's the next book.

23:25.177 --> 23:29.461
Some of the animals you might mention?

23:30.742 --> 23:38.710
There are some seals and birds and insects, all different kinds of animals.

23:38.730 --> 23:43.474
No, I try not to do the obvious one, or necessarily the

23:43.994 --> 23:49.501
These showy ones, like the panda, you know.

23:49.521 --> 23:55.810
There are animals like dinosaurs going extinct right in front of us about whom we know almost nothing.

23:55.830 --> 23:59.234
So I thought it would be a good idea to go out and have a look at them.

23:59.475 --> 24:05.723
But all of my books, as you rightly observe, are about either nature or human nature.

24:05.743 --> 24:08.787
I guess what you're saying is that it's almost a celebration of these creatures.

24:09.138 --> 24:12.062
It's not a polemic of any sort.

24:12.082 --> 24:19.552
It's not a polemic, although there is an essay on biodiversity at the beginning and our relationship with nature.

24:20.433 --> 24:27.863
No, it's a combination of description because some of these animals have not even been observed.

24:28.464 --> 24:33.911
They're going to disappear without anyone knowing what they looked like, what they sounded like, what their habits were like.

24:34.552 --> 24:36.715
That just seems unforgivable to me.

24:37.133 --> 24:41.900
So it's a combination of observation and celebration.

24:41.920 --> 24:47.569
And also a reluctance to let them disappear without at least somebody noticing.

24:47.589 --> 24:51.134
Are there any mammals among these unknown mammals?

24:51.154 --> 24:51.535
There are.

24:51.695 --> 24:54.259
If you don't mind, I just assume I'll specify which one.

24:54.299 --> 24:55.561
I understand.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.583
But yes, indeed.

24:56.603 --> 25:05.436
There are mammals, birds, reptiles, insects.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.142
Wow.

25:07.343 --> 25:09.488
And entire endangered habitat.

25:09.628 --> 25:10.269
That sounds exciting.

25:10.289 --> 25:14.659
And again, the focus of this piece is on these books.

25:14.679 --> 25:14.799
Right.

25:14.819 --> 25:16.684
But are there photographs or illustrations?

25:16.704 --> 25:17.846
No photos.

25:17.866 --> 25:20.833
I am the camera, as in all of my books.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.817
Explain a little bit about that to get back.

25:23.118 --> 25:46.527
I have a word process, and I adore it, but I pray that books will always be as eccentric as they are and portable and include

25:46.962 --> 25:51.447
words on pages that you turn, and writing the margins of.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.130
And this took you any number of questions.

25:54.150 --> 25:55.572
It took us four years.

25:55.592 --> 25:56.453
It took me three years.

25:57.294 --> 26:02.540
But as I say, I had been working on it quietly while I was doing other things.

26:02.700 --> 26:09.749
Because whenever I was observing animal behavior, I was quietly taking notes about their courtship and mating habits.

26:09.769 --> 26:15.315
And when I was working on the senses, I was also thinking about the sensory aspect of love.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.672
I end up writing a few books at the same time.

26:19.692 --> 26:33.366
My muse is very miscellaneous, and I can be writing an essay set in the Antarctic about penguins, as I did in Moon by Whaleye, and the sensory information that I learned will go into the census book, as it did.

26:34.027 --> 26:41.754
There will be some creative and emotional overspill, which will become home, that went into Jaguar of Sweet Laughter.

26:42.255 --> 26:45.538
So I end up, in that case, I ended up writing

26:45.856 --> 27:03.842
natural history of the census, the moon by whale light, jaguar of sweet laughter, all at the same time because the experiences were recording themselves in my creative mind in different drawers simultaneously.

27:03.862 --> 27:07.307
Is it involuntary which one you work on at any given time?

27:07.387 --> 27:09.650
Do you wake up and work on the phone?

27:09.851 --> 27:14.277
Because I support myself through my writing, I'm not teaching anywhere at the moment,

27:15.303 --> 27:17.927
I have to meet my deadlines first.

27:20.270 --> 27:24.135
So that usually means that I'm writing prose first.

27:24.576 --> 27:30.724
Case Me Magazine will ask me to write a poem to order, and I love when they do.

27:30.764 --> 27:37.914
The last time that happened, I was asked to write a poem about the eclipse, the solar eclipse.

27:38.735 --> 27:40.197
It's wonderful to have that excuse.

27:41.172 --> 27:43.817
Which publication did I see?

27:43.837 --> 27:44.518
Travel Holiday.

27:46.682 --> 27:49.627
And you did?

27:49.707 --> 27:49.807
Yeah.

27:49.827 --> 27:50.148
You produced it?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.552
Has it been published yet?

27:52.572 --> 27:53.874
Yeah, it has indeed.

27:53.894 --> 27:56.018
It was a seven-day cruise, seven-minute eclipse.

27:56.679 --> 27:57.400
Perfect ratio.

27:58.422 --> 28:01.948
And it gave me a chance to work as a poet.

28:02.502 --> 28:05.486
That was an assignment.

28:05.506 --> 28:06.147
Isn't that wonderful?

28:06.948 --> 28:08.230
Isn't that wonderful?

28:08.250 --> 28:08.410
I know.

28:08.430 --> 28:09.291
It's wonderful.

28:09.311 --> 28:10.753
It's truly wonderful.

28:10.773 --> 28:14.158
They're very enlightened people.

28:16.701 --> 28:22.589
How long was the poem?

28:22.609 --> 28:23.971
About 60 lines.

28:24.091 --> 28:29.438
What they did was run a prose article by a wonderful science writer and a poem with it.

28:29.705 --> 28:35.013
So it really was quite a splashy presentation about the eclipse by the time they were finished.

28:35.293 --> 28:39.259
And did you observe it through all these events and stuff?

28:39.480 --> 28:41.663
I was in New York City the day that.

28:41.683 --> 28:45.288
I went to Baja, and you could see it very well then.

28:45.429 --> 28:46.971
It's so eerie, I mean, particularly.

28:47.474 --> 29:09.446
I was in the ultimate jungle in Manhattan.

29:09.466 --> 29:09.606
I know.

29:09.626 --> 29:10.908
But I mean, it was a beautiful way, and this sky really changed.

29:10.928 --> 29:11.870
People were affected by it in a surprising way.

29:11.890 --> 29:14.133
You can see why the ancients would have promised to do absolutely anything for the sun to come back.

29:14.153 --> 29:14.474
It was so scary.

29:14.494 --> 29:16.857
All the priests would have to do is say to them, you give me all your property and your daughters and everything else.

29:17.377 --> 29:34.360
In the first minute, if the sky goes black or the sun will never come back, I mean, you would do it.

29:35.862 --> 29:40.308
And you would be so amazed that the priest could predict it that you would believe they could do anything.

29:40.328 --> 29:41.650
In terms of your writing routine, are you a rewriter or a reviser?

29:41.670 --> 29:42.391
I do an enormous amount of revising.

29:42.411 --> 29:42.912
I'm a compulsive reviser.

29:43.432 --> 29:45.975
But I don't think of it in any sort of negative way.

29:46.055 --> 30:06.921
I love playing with language, and I love trying to choose exactly the right word, especially the right verb, that will capture some moment of existence.

30:06.941 --> 30:08.423
No, I'm very disciplined now.

30:09.625 --> 30:12.308
I work so hard, and part of my work

30:12.659 --> 30:13.560
is on deadline.

30:15.682 --> 30:16.983
So I'm very disciplined about it.

30:17.544 --> 30:22.829
I know that I have to concentrate a huge amount of energy when I'm working.

30:22.849 --> 30:25.913
And I'm very good at turning it off in the time when I'm not working.

30:25.933 --> 30:30.057
I didn't used to be like that, but I've become more and more disciplined.

30:30.137 --> 30:32.780
Or I've become more secure in my creativity.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.681
I'm not sure which it is.

30:34.602 --> 30:39.246
But I start working about 9 in the morning.

30:39.266 --> 30:40.928
And before that, I go biking.

30:41.482 --> 30:42.863
five or ten miles.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.885
I love to do that.

30:44.965 --> 30:47.467
Or get some other exercise.

30:47.487 --> 30:50.570
When I start to work, it has my full attention.

30:50.590 --> 30:51.651
That's all I'm doing.

30:51.671 --> 30:56.976
And I can sit happily working for four or five hours at a stretch.

30:56.996 --> 30:58.878
Be very, very content.

30:58.898 --> 31:02.521
Then I'll stop and I'll have lunch with a friend and the work will not be on my mind.

31:03.642 --> 31:08.907
And then I'll go back to work for a few hours in the afternoon and work

31:09.140 --> 31:11.343
with all of my heart and soul during that time.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.827
And I'll stop at about 5 o'clock.

31:14.268 --> 31:16.751
I never really can do anything after then.

31:17.372 --> 31:21.679
And I'll have dinner and watch a movie or something at night.

31:21.699 --> 31:27.267
Yes, things will be on my mind in some subconscious way, but I'm very good at shutting off.

31:27.517 --> 31:28.739
The dynamo.

31:28.839 --> 31:30.160
When do you do your revisions?

31:30.701 --> 31:32.023
First thing in the morning?

31:32.323 --> 31:33.905
Or is that all part of the day?

31:33.985 --> 31:39.993
What I do when I'm working on a book is I begin each day by rereading the entire book.

31:40.013 --> 31:41.915
Up to that point.

31:44.538 --> 31:44.859
The entire book?

31:44.879 --> 31:44.959
Yes.

31:44.979 --> 31:46.561
So I know where I am.

31:46.581 --> 31:53.610
And in that process, of course... Even from page one to wherever you are.

31:54.751 --> 31:55.432
Wherever I am.

31:55.452 --> 31:56.173
Even if you're at the end, you'll...

31:56.879 --> 32:00.043
I always start from the beginning.

32:00.063 --> 32:08.574
If I'm at the end, I've already read it so many times that of course I can ski over some of the areas faster than others.

32:08.814 --> 32:15.142
But yes, I sit there for a few hours in the morning when I'm towards the end of the book, reading the whole book.

32:15.723 --> 32:23.713
And every time I go through it, there are always small changes that get made.

32:24.132 --> 32:40.534
If I had brought my book down and I showed you the background, you'd find in pencil little page numbers and changes.

32:40.554 --> 32:43.798
I bet when you're giving readings, the temptation is a headache.

32:43.818 --> 32:44.278
I sometimes do.

32:44.298 --> 32:51.608
Also, I make factual changes, if there are any, and typo changes in each of the editions, certainly when it goes into paperback.

32:52.077 --> 32:55.080
You always repeat.

32:55.381 --> 32:56.101
There's nothing worse.

32:56.121 --> 33:00.246
It's Char's quote, history repeats itself, historians repeat one another.

33:00.266 --> 33:03.129
You make a mistake and then it replicates itself.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.131
I know, it's terrible.

33:05.151 --> 33:17.545
I was reading, I love to read Raymond Chandler's Mysteries, but the bad news is that there are so many typographical errors in them now that it's tragic.

33:17.930 --> 33:18.931
It's really tragic.

33:18.951 --> 33:22.857
There are like 40 or 50 mistakes, bad mistakes.

33:22.877 --> 33:23.117
Really?

33:23.217 --> 33:24.499
Yeah.

33:24.659 --> 33:25.461
In every book.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.822
And it just breaks my heart.

33:26.923 --> 33:32.751
Nobody's proofing them anymore.

33:34.193 --> 33:36.636
Right.

33:37.457 --> 33:43.125
Ethan Keenan's book, and I love it.

33:43.145 --> 33:44.427
Whenever I find typos.

33:44.643 --> 33:48.049
I always correct them from edition to edition.

33:48.870 --> 33:52.677
You told me in the previous book that you actually hired a fact checker to help you.

33:52.977 --> 33:53.659
Yes, I did.

33:53.819 --> 33:55.001
Did you do the same with this?

33:55.021 --> 33:56.484
No, I didn't with this one.

33:58.046 --> 33:59.889
I did a lot of the fact checking myself.

34:00.891 --> 34:02.073
Actually, come to think of it.

34:02.153 --> 34:03.636
I'm sorry, take that back.

34:03.656 --> 34:09.486
I did hire someone to do a quick fact check.

34:09.837 --> 34:15.242
of all the spellings, the dates, the places, the numbers, things like that.

34:15.262 --> 34:24.311
You see, as engaging a read as it is, I have to believe that accuracy is a paramount for it.

34:24.472 --> 34:25.953
It is to me.

34:25.973 --> 34:30.357
It is to me because I love the universe the way it is.

34:30.998 --> 34:38.005
I don't need it to be distorted or prettied up or changed in any way.

34:38.356 --> 34:42.621
in order to find it fascinating and lovable.

34:43.502 --> 35:04.887
And I would like people to feel a curiosity about nature, an attachment to nature, and a delight in the experience of being human that's based on life as it really is.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.823
You can't do that without great attention to detail.

35:09.515 --> 35:10.945
That's perfect culture.
