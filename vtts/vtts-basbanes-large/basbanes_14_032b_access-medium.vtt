WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:10.682
of the expectation of the life of the book, then it's a wonderful method.

00:10.702 --> 00:21.713
But if you start for a de-explication, let's say a book from 1860 or 1870, that's a bad decision.

00:21.733 --> 00:26.457
So papers thinking is not enough to save it for you.

00:26.477 --> 00:28.700
So this is more or less preventive maintenance.

00:28.860 --> 00:32.063
Yes, that's what you're doing here.

00:32.887 --> 00:37.992
entering the equation earlier, I guess, before the book is really bad.

00:38.012 --> 00:45.879
But did you, Mr. Otto, told you about the paper splitting, about the volumes, about the volumes too?

00:46.600 --> 00:52.185
There's a wonderful breakpoint.

00:52.806 --> 01:02.775
And the idea is to have also a

01:03.008 --> 01:05.912
a larger output in the future.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.955
So what, now this is a paper splitter?

01:09.317 --> 01:19.332
The idea is to have, in the economic view, the same situation in the cost like microfilm.

01:19.352 --> 01:21.435
This is what we want to have.

01:21.455 --> 01:24.260
And we are sure we will reach this goal.

01:25.241 --> 01:32.712
So, if you have to make decisions to keep the book for the future,

01:33.552 --> 01:38.180
or to transfer it to a substitute.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.965
So you can decide it.

01:41.085 --> 01:43.789
You have not to decide it by economic way.

01:44.951 --> 01:46.314
This is very important.

01:46.334 --> 01:55.529
And then this is what we think we have to do for food culture, not to shift it to another medium.

01:56.190 --> 01:58.294
So a decision is made

01:58.983 --> 02:04.271
on the basis of anything but economics.

02:04.532 --> 02:05.413
That's fine.

02:05.433 --> 02:08.077
Is this an expensive process now?

02:09.399 --> 02:10.140
It is not cheap.

02:10.981 --> 02:21.938
I would say the kilogram, is it about... I'm nervous.

02:22.199 --> 02:27.707
Yeah, the kilogram is about like the... Two of this many.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.196
So about 10 Deutschmarks a book, in other words.

02:33.217 --> 02:40.388
The book, I would say, books are small and big, so it's difficult to say.

02:40.489 --> 02:42.251
Oh, it's a volume.

02:42.312 --> 02:43.814
Okay, it's weight.

02:44.515 --> 02:49.383
So 20 Deutschmarks for how much?

02:49.463 --> 02:50.524
For one kilo.

02:50.965 --> 02:52.568
For one kilo, okay.

02:52.588 --> 02:55.472
And that could be those three volumes that are one kilo?

02:55.552 --> 02:56.614
That's about a kilo.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.996
If you take this, you can take camera.

03:03.737 --> 03:05.959
That's not bad, actually.

03:06.299 --> 03:07.961
No, no, no.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.284
I would have expected there could be more, actually.

03:11.304 --> 03:12.144
That's for a whole book.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.047
That's pretty good.

03:16.929 --> 03:18.110
Yeah, very impressive.

03:18.130 --> 03:19.531
How old are these units here?

03:19.912 --> 03:21.013
How long have they been around?

03:21.053 --> 03:24.336
They started in 1992.

03:24.356 --> 03:24.656
Oh.

03:24.676 --> 03:24.816
1993.

03:24.976 --> 03:26.938
About 15.

03:29.078 --> 03:57.769
How was your trip?

03:58.542 --> 04:01.405
Oh, I was very late yesterday.

04:01.565 --> 04:07.551
So I had a lot of discussions in the Frankfurt Library, so I came after 11 o'clock.

04:07.571 --> 04:08.071
Oh, really?

04:08.572 --> 04:09.233
And you?

04:09.253 --> 04:10.554
This morning, yeah, we're good.

04:10.634 --> 04:13.157
You had a very early time.

04:13.197 --> 04:13.537
At 5.30?

04:14.418 --> 04:16.620
That's fine, but I'm still on American time.

04:16.840 --> 04:17.881
That's good.

04:17.901 --> 04:26.710
You know, it's really, back home, it's 5 o'clock in the morning at home now, so it's, I don't even know where I am in terms of the time.

04:28.225 --> 04:36.097
Mr. Otto was saying that what's really good is that they don't have to make a decision on whether or not something is to be saved.

04:36.117 --> 04:36.758
Everything is.

04:37.299 --> 04:38.361
Everything that comes down.

04:39.042 --> 04:41.846
We were looking at city directories, telephone books.

04:42.287 --> 04:44.871
He would say, what's the importance of this particular book?

04:45.392 --> 04:46.954
You don't ask that.

04:47.014 --> 04:50.099
This is what we said yesterday.

04:50.259 --> 04:53.845
We have to preserve the books as a

04:54.365 --> 04:55.066
continuum.

04:55.747 --> 05:12.790
It's a literature continuum, not a single book, but to make sure that independent of quality and selection, the book production could be available also in the future.

05:13.491 --> 05:15.253
Therefore, for us it's quite easy.

05:16.054 --> 05:21.942
Other libraries have to develop a strategy to select those books which have to preserve.

05:23.828 --> 05:26.652
But this is a different situation for us.

05:29.276 --> 05:38.751
But we did a lot to sway the policies that we use in our H2P paper.

05:38.831 --> 05:44.239
It was very disrespectful.

05:44.279 --> 05:52.772
The problem was not that there doesn't exist H2P paper in a certain quantity.

05:53.191 --> 05:57.158
quality, but the publishers did not really know about it.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.486
They didn't know about the danger of that sort of thing.

06:01.506 --> 06:06.055
So it was to inform them, to warn them.

06:06.075 --> 06:09.241
And in the meantime, they are quite happy.

06:09.261 --> 06:14.010
That's the season they've made.

06:14.070 --> 06:15.773
I was very pleased that my book was published then.

06:17.947 --> 06:21.253
It's the same like the supermarket.

06:21.333 --> 06:27.283
If you go to the supermarket, you look at the food, what day it is on the article.

06:27.904 --> 06:29.045
And this is the same.

06:29.506 --> 06:39.583
We will inform the users and the readers and the buyers of books, please look in the book if it's the...

06:39.901 --> 06:44.248
the indefinite... Exploration day.

06:44.428 --> 06:45.029
Exploration day.

06:45.049 --> 06:46.912
And if it's best, you can buy it.

06:47.012 --> 06:49.115
If not, you should leave it in the stacks.

06:49.555 --> 06:54.463
This was what the artist has stated.

06:55.224 --> 06:58.489
Our Gutenberg Bible is in Russia.

07:00.232 --> 07:00.572
Where?

07:00.893 --> 07:01.393
In Russia.

07:01.513 --> 07:02.956
In Moscow.

07:03.336 --> 07:05.680
And that was, of course, taken at the end of the war.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.242
The Red Army took...

07:07.627 --> 07:22.027
most of the very important Incunabula and the Gutenberg-Fahrer in 1946 to Russia, and in this case this aeroplane was so important for them.

07:22.668 --> 07:25.633
And it's still, we have seen it last autumn.

07:26.334 --> 07:27.675
As a good condition, have they?

07:27.696 --> 07:28.757
It's in good condition.

07:29.294 --> 07:31.417
And it was the one here in this?

07:31.638 --> 07:34.202
We had in Leipzig had two Bibles.

07:34.382 --> 07:38.148
One was in the Godship with I, and the other was in the university library.

07:38.248 --> 07:39.890
And both were taken?

07:40.311 --> 07:43.416
One is in the Lomonosov University, and the other is in the state library.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.758
Are you trying to get them back?

07:44.898 --> 07:53.331
I have to negotiate until now without success, but we are still optimistic.

07:53.351 --> 07:53.952
I will give a

07:54.218 --> 07:58.623
a lecture this evening about this whole problem in the House of Kids.

08:00.385 --> 08:02.748
Can I get a text of that at some point, do you think?

08:03.549 --> 08:05.572
Can I get a text of your speech on that?

08:05.592 --> 08:08.315
Yeah, it's in German.

08:08.335 --> 08:08.816
That's fine.

08:09.196 --> 08:09.456
Yeah?

08:09.657 --> 08:11.599
My daughter is very good in German.

08:11.619 --> 08:12.540
She should translate.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.482
Yeah.

08:14.542 --> 08:19.729
Paul Kitzner can explain to you how to go, how to do this .

08:19.809 --> 08:21.711
I'll send you an email.

08:22.045 --> 08:23.767
Yeah, it's easy to reach it.

08:23.867 --> 08:24.849
It's in the city.

08:24.869 --> 08:25.509
Good.

08:26.571 --> 08:26.771
Excellent.

08:26.791 --> 08:26.891
Good.

08:28.053 --> 08:28.653
Okay.

08:28.673 --> 08:31.057
Okay.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.458
It's just short enough to take notes.

08:32.478 --> 08:33.099
Okay, go ahead.

08:33.900 --> 08:38.706
I'm sorry, what's it going?

08:42.671 --> 08:43.312
Here we are.

08:44.193 --> 08:47.818
We collect exile literature.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.420
Exile literature.

09:01.769 --> 09:02.610
Who were forbidden?

09:04.813 --> 09:06.595
Who fled the country?

09:06.935 --> 09:07.156
Yes.

09:08.017 --> 09:08.457
Okay.

09:10.740 --> 09:14.244
After the war.

09:15.566 --> 09:18.369
Now these are books or do you have any archives?

09:18.830 --> 09:21.293
Do you have any material?

09:21.313 --> 09:22.995
They are only books.

09:23.255 --> 09:23.816
I see.

09:24.096 --> 09:24.456
I see.

09:26.279 --> 09:29.903
None printed material you can find in the

09:31.013 --> 09:33.836
So many exiles outside in Frankfurt.

09:34.057 --> 09:38.382
So you name this at the end?

09:38.602 --> 09:38.963
I see.

09:38.983 --> 09:42.287
Yes, okay.

09:42.307 --> 09:43.588
Good head.

09:46.912 --> 09:53.140
The world for our collection is this world.

10:00.038 --> 10:07.028
Since 1933.

10:07.108 --> 10:27.278
They did not collect, but they did.

10:27.865 --> 10:57.045
So I don't understand you said in 1933 they stopped collecting these authors or they did they started of the exiles they collected the material even though it was forbidden I don't understand

10:59.438 --> 11:03.924
I see.

11:04.785 --> 11:11.414
But it was all collected here.

11:11.935 --> 11:13.016
Yeah.

11:13.096 --> 11:13.777
I didn't know that.

11:14.078 --> 11:19.285
That's very interesting.

11:24.351 --> 11:28.076
That's the purpose of the collection in the Deuteronomy.

11:28.957 --> 11:29.378
I do it.

11:29.797 --> 11:31.740
wanted to collect the metadata.

11:36.747 --> 11:41.935
The works are also in exile.

11:48.785 --> 11:59.500
It was possible, in the main, after the beginning of the World War 1939 in the West.

12:02.939 --> 12:06.004
So they did collect?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.167
Let me put the literature here.

12:09.469 --> 12:09.850
They did.

12:09.910 --> 12:10.971
They collected.

12:12.173 --> 12:12.373
Yes.

12:13.375 --> 12:31.663
And we have books which came into the stock from the Soviet Union in 1941, 1942 up to the

12:33.567 --> 12:36.931
war in this country.

12:38.253 --> 12:46.023
And therefore, is this a lot of collection with many of our cell materials?

12:46.043 --> 12:46.864
I would think so.

12:49.407 --> 12:52.291
We tried to buy some books.

12:54.073 --> 12:59.601
I don't think so.

12:59.621 --> 13:02.224
So all those things are like colligories?

13:03.588 --> 13:05.811
The collection isn't complete.

13:07.292 --> 13:15.662
There are many books that you don't have.

13:16.202 --> 13:24.432
But the collection in Frankfurt, I think, was started after the war, the exile collection.

13:25.613 --> 13:27.655
That's why this is very interesting.

13:27.835 --> 13:31.840
But yours started even while they were going into exile.

13:33.777 --> 13:35.279
I'm amazed by that.

13:35.319 --> 13:39.364
I would have thought the policy would be that these people don't exist.

13:42.307 --> 13:48.795
In the Reichspielerei, it was a special period.

13:51.218 --> 14:01.270
The library was an official institution, a government, semi-governmental.

14:03.376 --> 14:11.188
Any day a state who will forbidden literature must know that.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.374
The state must know which books are known.

14:16.396 --> 14:18.679
The state must know which books, that's right.

14:20.061 --> 14:25.249
And therefore it was allowed by Guthers and Kroon.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.493
Okay, well, let me ask you this then.

14:33.513 --> 14:34.794
The books were collected, right?

14:35.495 --> 14:36.176
And kept here.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.858
But were people allowed to see them?

14:39.338 --> 14:39.538
No.

14:39.699 --> 14:39.899
No.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.142
In this time, yes.

14:43.182 --> 14:43.282
No.

14:43.342 --> 14:46.284
So you kept a record of the books.

14:46.304 --> 14:47.665
You kept a copy of the books.

14:51.369 --> 14:51.609
No.

14:51.889 --> 14:58.294
These books couldn't... Circulate.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.116
Circulate.

15:00.937 --> 15:01.277
No.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.455
No trade, no socialite.

15:04.957 --> 15:17.452
No... I'm sorry.

15:17.632 --> 15:18.033
I'm sorry.

15:18.153 --> 15:19.254
I'm sorry.

15:19.274 --> 15:21.537
Take international bibliography.

15:21.557 --> 15:21.677
I see.

15:22.639 --> 15:31.770
In this time, the actual books couldn't be recorded in the bibliography.

15:32.476 --> 15:34.779
Oh, they couldn't enter them into the bibliography.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.762
They weren't even entered into the bibliography.

15:38.843 --> 15:41.246
They were not entered into the bibliography.

15:44.090 --> 15:48.234
But the librarians, they must, they call it there.

15:48.254 --> 15:48.675
They what?

15:49.596 --> 15:50.497
Say that again?

15:50.597 --> 15:59.467
The librarians, they had to enter into the bibliography.

16:00.869 --> 16:01.690
And therefore,

16:03.138 --> 16:08.284
Yes, okay.

16:08.304 --> 16:11.968
Well, this is very good.

16:11.988 --> 16:14.010
I didn't get his name again.

16:14.851 --> 16:24.081
Such interim list, interim main list of literature that's not worth in the bibliography.

16:24.101 --> 16:31.609
And after the war, these lists were concluded to an supplement of the

16:31.977 --> 16:40.427
So, and this is the supplement.

16:41.228 --> 16:44.752
And what's the name of this book?

16:47.195 --> 16:49.217
German National Bibliography.

16:49.237 --> 16:51.400
German National Bibliography.

16:52.381 --> 16:56.786
But does it identify as the exile books?

16:56.806 --> 16:57.547
In the main, yes.

16:57.888 --> 16:58.148
Yes.

16:58.829 --> 17:01.512
A list of books

17:02.470 --> 17:24.015
Can I see who some of the offices are?

17:24.095 --> 17:26.638
Yes.

17:34.651 --> 17:35.972
This is a Nazi, though.

17:36.893 --> 17:44.962
So this book was published by... This book is... 1941.

17:45.083 --> 17:45.383
Oh, yeah.

17:45.423 --> 17:46.444
1989.

17:47.325 --> 17:48.366
Okay, this is a weird print.

17:48.426 --> 17:50.288
So I can see there's probably a mistake.

17:51.310 --> 17:52.471
Make me a copy of that, too.

17:52.631 --> 17:54.413
Yeah, because I can get it.

17:55.835 --> 17:58.638
So you are the custodian of these books?

18:00.179 --> 18:00.480
Yes.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.443
How large would you say the collection is?

18:04.823 --> 18:09.128
9,000 books.

18:09.368 --> 18:10.309
9,000 books.

18:10.409 --> 18:21.702
And we have circa 16,000 numbers of periodical issues.

18:24.225 --> 18:31.913
So, that's 700 periodicals in exile, in German exile.

18:31.953 --> 18:32.814
600, 700?

18:32.834 --> 18:33.195
Titles.

18:33.935 --> 18:34.476
Titles.

18:36.177 --> 18:39.843
And we count the issues each for one.

18:39.863 --> 18:43.949
There are 16,000 numbers.

18:44.209 --> 18:44.409
Wow.

18:45.571 --> 18:46.553
Okay.

18:47.274 --> 18:49.257
And you did keep a copy.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.801
There was a copy kept of all of them here.

18:52.442 --> 18:53.563
In this place right here?

18:54.124 --> 18:55.366
Yes.

18:55.386 --> 18:57.409
And we have this book.

19:04.308 --> 19:06.311
So what do we call this room now?

19:06.792 --> 19:09.998
This is special collections?

19:10.458 --> 19:11.220
Yes.

19:11.240 --> 19:18.853
These are compact.

19:18.873 --> 19:20.475
Are these the exiled books here?

19:22.980 --> 19:23.060
Yes.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.464
Klausmann, Heinrichmann.

19:25.484 --> 19:25.624
Uh-huh.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.021
Oh, this is good.

19:45.041 --> 19:47.605
Yeah, that's good.

19:51.270 --> 19:52.512
Good.

19:52.532 --> 19:53.934
And it says right on it, Exile.

19:54.856 --> 20:01.786
And you can see our location on board.

20:01.806 --> 20:02.467
That's the year.

20:02.647 --> 20:04.350
The year of the inventory.

20:05.331 --> 20:13.583
Not the publishing year, but the year of acquisition in the inventory.

20:16.263 --> 20:19.748
The letter for format and the current number.

20:19.768 --> 20:23.073
Was this sticker put on in 1944 or is this more recent?

20:24.515 --> 20:25.776
This exile sticker.

20:26.618 --> 20:27.118
It's recent.

20:27.479 --> 20:27.779
I see.

20:27.819 --> 20:29.882
After 1960.

20:30.203 --> 20:32.346
What did the A signify?

20:32.946 --> 20:35.490
It's a lot.

20:35.510 --> 20:36.752
I see.

20:36.772 --> 20:43.401
So how did they know that these were exile books when they first came in?

20:44.039 --> 20:48.145
What is there in this code to tell you that that was an exile book?

20:48.165 --> 20:49.668
Is there anything in that code to tell you?

20:50.389 --> 20:50.829
No.

20:50.849 --> 20:51.050
No.

20:51.751 --> 20:56.558
It's a normal location number of the tribunal.

20:56.578 --> 20:57.499
But it was brought up here.

20:58.901 --> 20:59.522
Yes.

20:59.542 --> 21:00.324
You see what I'm saying?

21:02.407 --> 21:06.713
What if somebody were to go look up this book downstairs in 1945?

21:06.934 --> 21:09.337
They wouldn't find this book in the catalog.

21:10.439 --> 21:10.519
Yes.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.492
They would find it.

21:12.155 --> 21:15.208
Today you would, but you wouldn't find it fifty years ago.

21:15.228 --> 21:19.788
I hope.

21:19.808 --> 21:20.712
Okay, go ahead.

21:38.478 --> 21:39.560
Okay.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.803
And this is where all of the exile books are in here?

21:43.145 --> 21:44.687
All of the exile books are in here.

21:44.727 --> 21:45.268
Yeah, are in here.

21:46.569 --> 21:47.751
And why are they still here?

21:47.811 --> 21:50.054
Why aren't they back in the general collection?

21:50.415 --> 21:52.918
Why have they been kept as a regular collection?

21:56.323 --> 22:00.869
I think because it's a separate collection of the library.

22:01.030 --> 22:01.430
I see.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.635
And we have a separate reading room for this collection.

22:04.655 --> 22:05.075
Oh, you do?

22:05.276 --> 22:05.756
Okay.

22:06.057 --> 22:06.257
And...

22:06.473 --> 22:14.423
That's why this collection is separate.

22:17.026 --> 22:18.908
What floor are we on the sixth floor now?

22:19.529 --> 22:19.889
Fifth.

22:21.972 --> 22:29.601
Okay, very good.

22:30.562 --> 22:31.383
Very interesting.

22:32.144 --> 22:35.248
I want to get one shot from here.

22:36.173 --> 22:52.675
Just to the... Thank you.

22:56.521 --> 22:57.642
One from here to one from here.

23:10.497 --> 23:13.781
These help me when I'm writing.

23:15.203 --> 23:20.190
I don't use them, but it does give me a... Yeah.

23:20.210 --> 23:25.017
It's worthwhile visual stuff.

23:29.203 --> 23:32.387
Great.

23:32.407 --> 23:36.673
Is that a special question?

23:36.693 --> 23:37.534
My question...

23:37.987 --> 23:41.090
The church of the library is a museum.

23:42.572 --> 23:50.840
The museum is founded in 1884.

23:50.860 --> 23:51.861
1884.

23:53.142 --> 24:06.255
And as a private collection from Dresden.

24:07.737 --> 24:11.761
Saxonia, Dresden.

24:12.782 --> 24:13.302
Dresden?

24:13.723 --> 24:17.707
Dresden.

24:17.727 --> 24:28.217
The founder was Heinrich Klemm.

24:28.237 --> 24:30.899
He made clothes.

24:30.919 --> 24:32.721
How do you spell Klemm?

24:32.741 --> 24:34.723
Klemm.

24:34.940 --> 24:40.327
K-L-E-W-M.

24:40.347 --> 24:44.111
And he made clothing.

24:44.392 --> 24:44.712
Yes.

24:45.013 --> 25:03.816
And he is very interesting in the history of printing, especially the history of the printing in German towns of Gutenberg and the

25:04.505 --> 25:19.649
followed printers of Gutenberg in Bamberg, Strasbourg, to Italy and France.

25:20.490 --> 25:32.149
And so the collection was, a special part of the collection was the first print in Germany.

25:34.070 --> 26:02.406
and also he collected he has collected prints in the followed times he is incunabular yes yes and and and then the the printers of the followed of of incunabular

26:03.618 --> 26:10.168
until the 19th century.

26:10.308 --> 26:10.769
Oh, really?

26:10.789 --> 26:11.490
It's his time.

26:11.870 --> 26:12.591
No kidding.

26:13.452 --> 26:26.151
And he was very interested in the questions of the first printers in each town.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.236
In each town, that's very interesting.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.140
Yes.

26:33.520 --> 26:50.408
which stamps and which initials and impressions in the prints.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.998
Did he collect type too?

26:56.278 --> 26:57.019
Yes, yes.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.201
So typefaces?

26:58.262 --> 26:59.123
Yes, yes.

26:59.407 --> 27:01.731
Bindings?

27:01.931 --> 27:03.674
No, no bindings, no.

27:03.914 --> 27:23.885
He gave all his prints to the book binders in Dresden and they must new bind the books.

27:26.068 --> 27:28.131
So they bound the books there.

27:28.651 --> 27:30.614
That's not good.

27:30.634 --> 27:32.176
Oh, very bad.

27:32.196 --> 27:42.149
And so the collection is... They didn't understand.

27:42.890 --> 27:45.514
He was a man of 19th century.

27:46.776 --> 27:57.510
And he... His private collection and he wanted to see...

27:57.845 --> 28:07.576
gold on the bindings and no pigskin and... They didn't understand then.

28:07.656 --> 28:09.598
They didn't understand how important it is.

28:09.779 --> 28:11.100
Yes, yes.

28:11.120 --> 28:19.229
And so the collection is horror with bindings.

28:19.249 --> 28:20.751
How many books in the collection?

28:21.312 --> 28:22.573
20,000.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.876
20,000?

28:25.376 --> 28:26.738
Wow.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.470
And how did it come to Leipzig?

28:29.771 --> 28:31.072
Yes.

28:31.613 --> 28:50.276
Heinrich Klemm... The USA came to Heinrich Klemm and asked him to give his collection.

28:50.537 --> 28:52.199
Who asked him?

28:52.219 --> 28:53.240
Who asked him?

28:54.161 --> 28:54.682
Somebody.

28:55.002 --> 28:56.124
Yes.

28:56.144 --> 28:57.265
And...

28:58.240 --> 29:08.633
But he was an actual man and he gave his collection to Lazsic.

29:12.959 --> 29:16.163
When did he do that?

29:16.243 --> 29:20.468
This was 1883.

29:22.692 --> 29:27.316
Professor Lieblund told me that after the war the Russians took your Gutenberg Bible.

29:27.336 --> 29:28.077
Yes, yes.

29:28.117 --> 29:29.679
How come they didn't take just that?

29:29.739 --> 29:30.840
Yes, yes, yes.

29:31.340 --> 29:33.683
In this collection was the Gutenberg Bible.

29:34.443 --> 29:36.765
They took the Gutenberg Bible out of this collection?

29:36.786 --> 29:38.227
Yes, yes.

29:38.247 --> 29:44.052
It was the most beautiful part of the collection.

29:44.072 --> 29:45.274
But they left the other things?

29:46.375 --> 29:48.917
Yes, yes.

29:48.937 --> 29:49.658
That's terrible.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.940
Yes, very, very terrible.

29:52.274 --> 30:02.796
And we hope that the Russians will give us... I hope so too, but don't hold your breath as we say in my country.

30:06.383 --> 30:13.658
Mr. Norman from USA has wrote about this problem.

30:14.026 --> 30:15.768
with our Gutenberg Bible.

30:15.969 --> 30:16.690
Mr. Norman?

30:16.870 --> 30:31.790
Yes, he has a census, he has made a census about all Gutenberg Bibles in the world, and he wrote about the Leipzig Gutenberg Bible.

30:32.651 --> 30:33.392
Who's Norman?

30:33.652 --> 30:34.173
Norman.

30:34.193 --> 30:35.475
Is he an American?

30:35.495 --> 30:38.559
Yes, yes.

30:38.579 --> 30:43.746
It was in the 16th year's

30:46.088 --> 30:48.190
Is that what it's called, the Leipzig Bible?

30:48.350 --> 30:49.412
It's called the Leipzig?

30:49.512 --> 30:49.972
Yes.

30:50.252 --> 31:01.284
And it's still, they call it... But in the university, library of university, also two Bibles of Gutenberg.

31:03.066 --> 31:03.867
They've gone to?

31:04.588 --> 31:06.009
Also to Russia.

31:09.052 --> 31:11.455
So there are no Gutenberg Bibles here in Leipzig?

31:12.380 --> 31:19.731
One in the university library.

31:19.751 --> 31:21.413
Okay, good.

31:21.433 --> 31:23.657
And so you're the librarian?

31:24.318 --> 31:25.520
What's your title?

31:27.022 --> 31:32.730
My title is Wissenschaftliche Bibliothekaren.

31:35.915 --> 31:38.178
But you are director of this?

31:38.719 --> 31:41.323
No, no, no, no.

31:41.675 --> 31:43.938
I have a director.

31:43.958 --> 31:44.979
I see.

31:45.099 --> 31:45.820
Okay.

31:46.380 --> 32:10.568
And, but in the history of our museum, Heinrich Klemborstreich, 1885, is the Custos Karl Behrend Lorich

32:12.185 --> 32:41.770
had collected bindings from Germany and England and antiquarian trade and so to begin of our century a great collection of bindings came in the museum 400 bindings of baroque and

32:44.703 --> 32:49.730
and also of oriental bindings.

32:52.154 --> 32:58.383
And the two part, this is going to Russian.

33:01.067 --> 33:13.545
And now we have some new bindings of the 20th century of binders of Leipzig and GDR,

33:14.167 --> 33:37.222
And now we try to work with binders and to buy new binders, bindings, hand bindings.

33:40.447 --> 33:42.891
Okay.

33:46.972 --> 34:00.930
Our museum is working with the praxis, with the reality of polygraphy and printing in Leipzig.

34:01.971 --> 34:16.810
And so expositions and we have wide collections of

34:17.887 --> 34:37.331
manufacturers and archives of firms and in German it's a publication of books.

34:39.634 --> 34:41.456
Very interesting.

34:41.476 --> 34:43.138
You're going to take me to see it?

34:43.799 --> 34:45.261
Yes, yes.

34:45.713 --> 35:14.590
And also we work together with artists and with high school or high school of art in Leipzig to take

35:15.565 --> 35:44.425
contact to have with students and professors and teachers of the School of Arts and we take their

35:45.383 --> 36:05.950
diplomas and their illustrations and their writing teletrophies in our collections.

36:07.492 --> 36:15.222
And also we have occasions

36:22.728 --> 36:34.409
The book museum in Deutsche Bücher in Leipzig has one specific aspect, that you combine all branches around the book in one museum.

36:34.629 --> 36:36.012
This is unique.

36:36.873 --> 36:42.964
Book trade, book illustration, book production, binding, all the aspects.

36:43.619 --> 36:49.568
And even the development of letters, of... Oh, types.

36:49.848 --> 37:03.990
And therefore, if anybody is working here, he can see the interdisciplinarity of this branch in a way which you will never have... I've never seen anything like it.

37:04.450 --> 37:08.817
And what we both want to do next year is...

37:09.117 --> 37:31.007
To enhance the space of the Book Museum, we want to have a separate building attached to the Deutsche Bücherei so that the reading rooms will be in a better condition and we want more showrooms

37:31.223 --> 37:32.244
for the presentation.

37:32.264 --> 37:33.105
It's really beautiful.

37:33.465 --> 37:34.967
I've never seen anything like it.

37:34.987 --> 37:44.336
I had no idea that Leipzig was such a center for... It was the center of... I wrote in my notebook, get a history of Leipzig when I get home.

37:44.957 --> 37:45.578
I have to read.

37:45.598 --> 37:47.860
I had no idea.

37:48.280 --> 37:56.909
And you see, maybe you have seen the exhibition, Mercure and... Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:56.929 --> 37:57.670
And this is...

37:58.021 --> 38:06.709
This shows you quite good that Leipzig was a focus of the development of printing and publishing in Germany.

38:06.869 --> 38:07.089
Amazing.

38:07.109 --> 38:08.410
Very concentrated.

38:08.550 --> 38:08.971
It's great.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.853
And this building is beautiful.

38:12.013 --> 38:13.254
It's really beautiful.

38:13.295 --> 38:14.015
Congratulations.

38:14.035 --> 38:16.838
We call it Jugendstil Art Deco.

38:17.738 --> 38:18.319
Kind of.

38:18.779 --> 38:27.387
And the reading room for science is just finished again and it's Bauhaus.

38:27.822 --> 38:32.112
it's very nice to hear from you
