00:02.343 --> 00:03.144
Okay, we're running.

00:03.924 --> 00:07.568
Congratulations on a wonderful new book.

00:08.088 --> 00:08.428
Thank you.

00:09.990 --> 00:15.615
One of the first questions, I had jury duty Friday, and so I had the whole, I waited, you know, for eight hours.

00:15.635 --> 00:18.397
I really had time to work on notes for this.

00:18.897 --> 00:21.980
And one of the first things I said to him, I wrote down, is it a biography or a history?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.545
And then, of course, you say, you know, you try to use the different forms, hoping that one will reinforce the other.

00:27.825 --> 00:29.226
But I don't call it a biography.

00:29.286 --> 00:30.608
I call it a history.

00:30.728 --> 00:31.168
Yeah.

00:31.672 --> 00:39.004
Because, first of all, I think that biography does have rules, I think.

00:39.084 --> 00:42.390
And one of the rules is that you want to get as close to somebody's heart as possible.

00:43.051 --> 00:45.655
And I don't take that as my assignment for King.

00:46.477 --> 00:47.679
And secondly, you don't wander.

00:47.739 --> 00:53.508
You don't wander as much as I do because there's so many times when I'm far, far away from King here.

00:53.528 --> 00:57.595
I'm trying to do the things that are related to King by...

00:59.110 --> 01:08.298
politically or by the ethos of the freedom movement and not something that affects him personally, which I think is all you would follow as a biographer.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.921
So I call it a biographical history or a narrative history.

01:12.002 --> 01:14.404
America in the King years pretty much sums it up to me.

01:14.424 --> 01:17.647
And that's what I wrote in the proposal.

01:18.107 --> 01:20.269
It's one of the few things that holds up from the proposal.

01:20.869 --> 01:27.075
The original proposal written in 1981 saying I wanted to call it a biographical history or a narrative history.

01:27.477 --> 01:29.660
America and the King Years, I thought it would take three years.

01:31.623 --> 01:34.328
When I wrote my first proposal, it's almost laughable to look at it.

01:34.668 --> 01:36.471
I mean, my guy hadn't even been arrested yet.

01:36.832 --> 01:38.214
The guy who was the star of my book.

01:38.895 --> 01:39.055
Really?

01:39.075 --> 01:40.157
I didn't even know he existed.

01:40.177 --> 01:41.439
So you're a clairvoyant.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.823
No, I was working on other stuff.

01:43.843 --> 01:49.091
And then the book I'm working on now, I'm looking at the proposal that I did on this book three years ago.

01:49.111 --> 01:52.736
And what's turning out to be the three most important chapters aren't even in there.

01:53.818 --> 01:54.900
You know?

01:54.920 --> 01:55.020
Yeah.

01:55.287 --> 01:56.068
So go figure.

01:56.168 --> 01:56.709
Yeah.

01:56.729 --> 01:57.991
But you knew what you were up to.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.032
Right.

01:59.272 --> 02:06.081
And also it allows you to really profile Malcolm X. It allows you to... Through Abraham Heschel.

02:06.101 --> 02:06.982
Abraham, exactly.

02:07.002 --> 02:07.683
And all these others.

02:07.703 --> 02:08.424
And LBJ.

02:08.444 --> 02:16.916
And if you want to spend a little time with Hoover and RFK, you know, you can do that with a biographical history because they're very important players.

02:16.976 --> 02:18.177
Right.

02:18.257 --> 02:22.323
Yeah, I'd say they're important players in this era.

02:22.984 --> 02:24.045
So, yeah, I don't get...

02:25.105 --> 02:29.012
There are plenty of arguments about this, but most of them are political arguments.

02:29.032 --> 02:32.458
Arguments among professional writers?

02:32.538 --> 02:37.367
Among movement people, is King over or under-emphasized?

02:37.387 --> 02:49.729
Some people resent, particularly students say that all this history is reduced to King, and other people say there are too many peripheral figures.

02:50.047 --> 02:51.128
But those are political.

02:51.148 --> 02:52.870
Those aren't questions of craft.

02:52.970 --> 02:57.675
I don't really have many craft people saying, well, the way you... No, I don't think it.

02:57.695 --> 02:59.657
I certainly wouldn't crack.

02:59.677 --> 03:05.963
And I think King is more, and you even say it in the book, is more metaphor for you than he is a biographical subject.

03:06.003 --> 03:10.388
Maybe you could tell me a little bit what he is for you metaphorically.

03:11.168 --> 03:19.817
Well, you know, the 54-68 period, which is what the whole thing is about, the three volumes, is

03:20.303 --> 03:36.745
It really begins in the year, the Brown decision, ends in 68 with the movement falling apart, and it is kind of, sometimes I've called it the rise of classical post-war liberalism.

03:36.825 --> 03:42.232
Other times I've said that it's really the civil rights movement.

03:44.956 --> 03:48.741
The pressures created by World War II when you're fighting people

03:49.092 --> 03:54.058
totalitarianism on behalf of the free world, and now you come back and people say, well, do we mean it at home?

03:54.539 --> 03:58.964
Because that's kind of a reality check of the Civil Rights Movement.

03:59.445 --> 04:06.634
It kind of created all of this period, the lynchings of soldiers when they came home, and it built up into the 54 to 68 period.

04:06.654 --> 04:14.003
So from the Brown decision to 68 is a discrete era, it seems to me, when there is a movement rising up to test

04:14.523 --> 04:28.365
for this century, what was tested by the Civil War and Reconstruction in the last century, which is what do we mean by democratic principles as applied to race, to slavery or to segregation.

04:28.565 --> 04:33.053
And I just think that it's a very discreet period of history.

04:33.193 --> 04:38.040
And King, it seems to me, you could call it the King years for a number of reasons.

04:38.441 --> 04:41.526
One, at its simplest level, is...

04:42.468 --> 04:47.294
absolute coincidence that he began his ministry.

04:47.314 --> 04:50.778
He took his first church in the year of the Brown decision.

04:50.798 --> 04:54.883
He hardly gets there when the bus boycott breaks out and he's drafted into its leadership.

04:55.584 --> 05:08.880
And for all the periods thereafter when he's not at the heart of the civil rights movement or when he's not at the forefront, when he's

05:09.097 --> 05:10.380
He's not the leader of the sit-ins.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.722
He's not the leader of the Freedom Rides.

05:11.742 --> 05:12.604
He didn't want to join them.

05:12.624 --> 05:13.546
He tried to get out of them.

05:14.688 --> 05:18.336
But he is at the heart of the argument about what's it about.

05:18.496 --> 05:22.063
And the people who are ahead of him in the Freedom Rides want his involvement.

05:22.083 --> 05:24.989
And the people who want to stop the Freedom Rides come to him to stop them.

05:25.009 --> 05:26.953
So he's the...

05:27.305 --> 05:31.212
He's the hub at the center of the wheel with all the folks of this period.

05:31.473 --> 05:32.855
And, of course, he's killed in 68.

05:32.935 --> 05:35.440
68, which is when you have the fragmentation of the movement.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.263
So he's there from the beginning to the end.

05:37.303 --> 05:49.245
You know, it'd be ridiculous to call it America in the Snake years or America in the Bob Moses years or America in the... You could call it America in the era of the Freedom Movement, but...

05:49.529 --> 05:51.931
Who the hell knows Bob Moses with all due respect?

05:51.951 --> 05:54.453
I thought you were talking about Robert Moses.

05:54.473 --> 05:55.074
In New York.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.156
You're not the only one.

05:57.196 --> 06:03.521
Speaking of Bibria files, if you go to the LBJ library and you ask for the file on Bob Moses, you get them co-mingled.

06:03.902 --> 06:15.812
They have one file on Robert Moses with huge amounts of Bob Moses of New York, and occasionally you have to go through there and look for the... Is it a computer entry or a catalog entry?

06:15.952 --> 06:18.034
Just out of curiosity.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.631
catalog.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.913
Now, maybe it's been computerized.

06:20.973 --> 06:24.037
This is what people say when you talk about going over to computers.

06:25.258 --> 06:33.548
The researcher only knows, unless the researcher demands to go see the archives personally, what the computer tells you is in there.

06:33.609 --> 06:42.199
And if somebody's screwing up and saying, Bob Moses, because they're contemporaneous, you know, be a letter to the president from Robert Moses, 1961,

06:42.449 --> 06:46.395
That sounds terrible.

06:46.435 --> 06:54.667
All this stuff about the West Side Highway and all this, and those ones from Bob Moses, please protect us at Freedom Summer, the other Bob Moses.

06:55.128 --> 07:00.236
So anyway, that's where America and the King years comes, and it just seems to me that this is the era.

07:00.837 --> 07:11.072
See, I see it as a recurring thing, as a recurring thing where you really test what equal citizenship means, and that this period did that and sucked in

07:11.390 --> 07:18.818
all kinds of other energies and related questions once you get the country energized about that the way it had been in the Civil War years.

07:18.938 --> 07:27.747
And so I see that as part of a continuing American story, and King is at the heart of this one.

07:28.167 --> 07:30.750
When you proposed it, did you propose a trilogy?

07:31.131 --> 07:32.572
No, I proposed one built-in book.

07:32.852 --> 07:33.753
It's going to take three years.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.397
And the first time it was my idea about it.

07:37.799 --> 07:45.429
The first time it was my idea, because after a while I wrote all of this, I had to cut over 700 pages of manuscript out of part in the water.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.152
I hope it went to here.

07:47.472 --> 07:47.652
No?

07:47.993 --> 07:48.233
No.

07:49.375 --> 07:49.855
They're out.

07:49.875 --> 07:50.476
They're gone.

07:50.496 --> 07:51.337
That's so sad.

07:51.718 --> 07:52.639
It's like unwriting.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.204
You couldn't even use it for here?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.407
No, not really.

07:58.876 --> 08:00.738
Someday I'll go back and look at it.

08:01.059 --> 08:04.984
I mean, the whole process of cutting something like that is quite a... Tell me about it.

08:05.004 --> 08:05.304
I know.

08:05.445 --> 08:07.888
I mean, I cut several hundred pages out of my own.

08:08.649 --> 08:12.514
First time I went through, it was a 1,900-page manuscript.

08:12.534 --> 08:19.003
First time I went through, and I took two or three days, and I went through, and I think I cut ten pages, because I'm doing widows and all this.

08:19.483 --> 08:24.330
But in order to do it at the level you have to do it, it's almost like you have to build up kind of a bloodlust.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.912
Well, that's when you bring Alice in.

08:25.932 --> 08:26.993
Well, Alice was...

08:27.074 --> 08:29.157
Alice was standing behind me with a big mallet.

08:30.780 --> 08:35.547
She's legendary for her ability to... Did you have Alice from the outside?

08:36.208 --> 08:37.389
Oh, yeah, I've had Alice.

08:37.890 --> 08:45.762
I had Alice beginning with Blind Ambition, a book I did on Watergate 20-something years ago, first one.

08:46.463 --> 08:48.426
This is my fifth book with Alice.

08:49.127 --> 08:51.350
She's been here for... Blind Ambition?

08:51.370 --> 08:53.013
John Dean's book about Watergate.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.635
Yes, I was his ghostwriter for that.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.558
That was the best written book of the whole lot.

08:57.112 --> 08:57.853
Congratulations.

08:57.873 --> 08:59.516
Thank you.

08:59.596 --> 09:01.599
I'm still proud of that book.

09:02.239 --> 09:04.262
I'm still proud of that book.

09:04.282 --> 09:05.705
Do they say this here?

09:06.666 --> 09:06.906
No.

09:07.828 --> 09:08.148
No.

09:08.889 --> 09:09.370
Jerry did.

09:10.471 --> 09:16.440
No, it's not listed there, although my book with Bill Russell is listed there, and it was signed under the same contract.

09:16.460 --> 09:19.084
But when we finished, he said, look, gosh, you've really worked hard.

09:19.244 --> 09:21.387
You wrote the book, and he insisted that I'd be on.

09:21.407 --> 09:22.950
Yeah, that's pretty decent.

09:23.370 --> 09:25.954
But it's not Bill Russell's ambition.

09:26.322 --> 09:27.203
to be a writer.

09:27.824 --> 09:29.407
Bill Russell, what are we talking about?

09:29.427 --> 09:31.770
Of the Celtics.

09:31.790 --> 09:31.910
Okay.

09:31.950 --> 09:34.434
Not William Russell, senator from the Celtics.

09:34.494 --> 09:35.395
No, no, no, no, no.

09:35.415 --> 09:36.938
This is Bill Russell, the Celtics.

09:36.958 --> 09:44.829
No, when I was starting to write after my magazine career, I thought writers, when I decided I wanted to... See, they didn't give me a bio of you.

09:44.849 --> 09:47.053
Do you mind giving me a little... No.

09:47.073 --> 09:54.203
When I decided that I wanted to, after a magazine career, I was, as a kid,

09:54.655 --> 10:00.963
Try to do it in one sentence per decade almost, and then you can ask if you want to know any more about it.

10:01.244 --> 10:05.930
I grew up in the segregated South, utterly disinterested in all politics.

10:05.950 --> 10:11.097
My father ran a dry cleaning plant, said that anybody interested in politics couldn't find honest work.

10:11.117 --> 10:14.982
My father ran a dry cleaning plant.

10:15.022 --> 10:16.263
I worked in the cleaners.

10:17.946 --> 10:20.108
We did laundry too.

10:20.169 --> 10:21.270
We did cleaning and laundry.

10:21.723 --> 10:28.612
And I got interested in, and I lived in Atlanta, Dr. King City, but never saw him in the flesh.

10:29.353 --> 10:33.599
But I was transfixed by some of the demonstrations I saw on television.

10:33.619 --> 10:35.381
I asked my parents how it could be happening.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.265
And they didn't have an answer.

10:38.325 --> 10:38.806
How old are you?

10:39.767 --> 10:40.649
I'm 51 now.

10:40.969 --> 10:44.674
So I was in high school, early high school.

10:45.215 --> 10:48.139
And when I got to college, which is where?

10:48.559 --> 10:49.941
Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

10:50.832 --> 10:52.615
I started losing interest.

10:52.655 --> 11:04.672
I was planning to be a doctor, and from asking how this could happen and what is this amazing movement I see on TV, I started studying history and politics.

11:04.692 --> 11:18.392
I dropped all my pre-med courses after a while, got interested in politics, caught up with it, and couldn't make up my mind what I wanted to do, whether I wanted to teach or go into politics, so I backed into writing instead.

11:18.760 --> 11:40.505
and magazines at the Washington Monthly and then Harper's and Esquire writing magazine columns and then basically decided I didn't want to be a magazine writer the rest of my life but that I wasn't going to grow up and find what I really wanted to do so I should try writing and to me writing was writing books and writing books was novels but I couldn't get a contract to write a novel and I had to support myself and so I said what do novels do?

11:41.126 --> 11:46.472
Novelists do they write through the eyes of their characters who are different

11:46.925 --> 11:49.268
And I saw that that's what a ghostwriter would do.

11:49.568 --> 11:54.153
So I thought being a ghostwriter would be a good practice for writing novels.

11:55.074 --> 12:08.149
And Alice, I had a contract actually with Alice for a book that I had to, the first sensible thing I did in the early 70s was to welch on a contract to write a book called The Frontiers of American Decadence.

12:09.351 --> 12:11.413
I was going to write about Miami.

12:11.815 --> 12:21.505
So I owed Alice a book, and she came with me to me desperate, saying that John Dean had turned in his manuscript on Watergate, and that it ended with him going to Washington.

12:22.245 --> 12:29.673
And his explanation was that he had already testified about Watergate, so that he thought everybody already had all they needed on that, and that this was about his growing up.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.976
And so she panicked and said, would you go out there?

12:32.996 --> 12:36.019
So I went out, and I lived with Dean and wrote Find Ambition.

12:36.039 --> 12:36.460
And where was he?

12:36.480 --> 12:37.060
He went out where?

12:37.501 --> 12:38.121
To L.A.

12:38.161 --> 12:39.983
He lived in Los Angeles.

12:40.334 --> 12:46.920
lived with him and Moe and their two poodles for eight months of concentrated work, wrote the whole book, hardly ever went out of his house.

12:47.821 --> 12:49.823
Did you get credit for that?

12:49.843 --> 12:52.005
Well, thanks to Taylor.

12:52.365 --> 12:56.449
Yeah, because I remember when that book came out, it was, geez, this Dean's a good writer.

12:57.070 --> 12:58.231
That was what people were saying.

12:58.751 --> 13:02.535
In fact, he even tried to make himself a journalist there for a while.

13:02.675 --> 13:03.436
Right.

13:03.476 --> 13:08.080
Well, but see, he knew he had no career because he is,

13:08.498 --> 13:14.564
pariah to the Democrats, because he's a Nixon person, and to Republicans, he's a turncoat.

13:14.584 --> 13:22.091
So he's desperate, and in fact, you know, that's another long story, but he wound up essentially living off of Moe.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.673
She went to work to support the family.

13:23.753 --> 13:25.414
I thought she left him, no?

13:25.655 --> 13:26.175
Didn't she either?

13:26.515 --> 13:29.378
I would have sworn that she was going through a couple years ago.

13:29.779 --> 13:30.499
No, she never did.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.762
She's right there with him right now.

13:33.482 --> 13:38.387
And of course, they're still going on, because

13:39.515 --> 13:45.262
They are a target of right-wing conspiracy books that say that he engineered the Watergate break-in.

13:45.322 --> 13:59.739
Gordon Liddy and all of those people, to protect Moe, who is running a call-girl ring, all of which is utter libel, but Gordon Liddy and Rush Limbaugh and all these people promote this because it exonerates Nixon.

14:00.660 --> 14:04.044
Liddy says he was a dupe of John Dean, so they're taking this.

14:04.064 --> 14:04.404
Liddy said this?

14:04.424 --> 14:07.648
Yeah, oh, and Dean is suing Liddy.

14:08.303 --> 14:14.990
The authors of a book called Silent Coup and Holborn and the publisher, which settled— Who's the publisher?

14:15.571 --> 14:20.236
No, but in that same—I want to say Lyle Stewart.

14:20.817 --> 14:24.601
Lyle Stewart would be—not one of the big guys.

14:24.821 --> 14:26.002
No, not one of the big guys.

14:26.583 --> 14:35.593
Anyway, and I'm getting dragged into this lawsuit because they're trying to say that Dean was a liar by poking holes in tiny discrepancies between his

14:35.877 --> 14:38.060
sworn testimony and what's in Blind Ambition.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.724
It's so hard for him to win because he's a public figure.

14:40.764 --> 14:41.045
Right.

14:41.305 --> 14:42.366
Everybody knows that.

14:43.408 --> 14:54.043
But anyway, out of the success of Blind Ambition, I got a lot of offers as ghostwriters because it was different then.

14:54.063 --> 14:56.467
It was really a ghostwritten era.

14:57.068 --> 15:00.653
It's an amazing discipline.

15:01.207 --> 15:02.048
Well, it is now.

15:02.429 --> 15:03.110
It is now.

15:03.130 --> 15:05.353
If you're Novak, this guy Novak makes big money.

15:05.413 --> 15:05.694
Right.

15:05.734 --> 15:10.881
See, we didn't have Novak back then, and it was all kind of on a hush-hush list that the publishers would circulate.

15:10.901 --> 15:12.363
You know, you've got a celebrity.

15:12.383 --> 15:14.006
If you want a book, you need a writer.

15:14.066 --> 15:16.950
And it wasn't a developed market then the way it is now.

15:17.551 --> 15:19.474
And I got offered several things.

15:19.494 --> 15:24.742
And so, to me, from my mindset at the time, I said, okay, I'm practicing to be a novelist.

15:24.762 --> 15:26.404
What I should do is to pick the person...

15:26.907 --> 15:32.534
as different as possible from John Dean and write from his point of view or her point of view.

15:33.295 --> 15:35.457
So I picked Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.839
Was Bill looking for a...?

15:37.159 --> 15:37.480
Yeah.

15:37.620 --> 15:40.944
Most of them were political figures, you know, John Mitchell.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.105
What was the title of the Russell book?

15:42.146 --> 15:42.806
Second Wind.

15:43.407 --> 15:44.809
Who published that?

15:44.829 --> 15:45.209
SNS, too?

15:45.249 --> 15:46.291
No, that was Random House.

15:49.254 --> 15:50.476
Bill Russell, Second Wind.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.379
And that was a great experience.

15:53.399 --> 15:56.543
And so then, after that, I...

15:56.911 --> 16:02.838
I said, okay, I'm either going to write another ghost-written book, or I think maybe I'm ready to try my first novel.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.341
If I'd done a ghost-written book, it was going to be a woman.

16:05.401 --> 16:06.763
I was looking around for a woman.

16:07.243 --> 16:08.405
This is all training for you.

16:08.445 --> 16:09.145
Training.

16:09.226 --> 16:10.607
You developed a narrative point of view.

16:11.648 --> 16:18.677
From a narrative point of view, but also my naive point of view, that real writers are novelists, because that's what I carried with me.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.339
We probably both still believe that.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.222
Yeah, from my fifth grade class in Atlanta.

16:23.742 --> 16:28.727
So I did a novel with Alice called, my second book with her, called The Empire Blues.

16:28.948 --> 16:30.329
The Empire Blues.

16:30.449 --> 16:48.889
And it was essentially a novelized form, a nonfiction book that I decided not to do about Miami because I went down there in the early 70s when there was a lot of terrorism and early drug trade and a lot of spies and the detritus of the Kennedy CIA vendetta against Castro and Cubans running around.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.904
kind of da-da culture, and I didn't do that.

16:51.924 --> 16:55.689
So I wrote this novel, which sold about, I don't know, 300 copies.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.512
Got very good reviews.

16:57.532 --> 16:58.754
What were you able to come in?

16:59.555 --> 17:02.779
I would say Dean was 76.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.442
Russell was 78.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.306
I think this was probably 79 or 80.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.007
Well, you're working.

17:08.107 --> 17:09.149
You're being very productive.

17:09.389 --> 17:17.661
And then I did a book about the Lotelier assassination, an international crime story, which actually I did only...

17:18.704 --> 17:21.286
By accident, this guy was blown up.

17:21.326 --> 17:22.327
He was a Chilean ambassador.

17:22.367 --> 17:25.970
He was blown up in the embassy district in Washington by a remote-controlled bomb.

17:26.531 --> 17:29.854
It turned out to have been sent by the Chilean secret police.

17:29.874 --> 17:30.554
And I did it.

17:30.615 --> 17:35.719
It was the last sayonara I did for the underworld because I was trying to get away from that.

17:36.940 --> 17:45.508
But in retrospect, it was very good practice for King because it was with FBI agents, and it was invaluable practice.

17:45.988 --> 17:47.249
What is the title of that book?

17:47.269 --> 17:48.070
Called Labyrinth.

17:48.404 --> 17:49.886
L-A-B-Y-R-I-N-T-H.

17:50.868 --> 17:53.793
All of them, except Dean, are listed here, I think.

17:53.813 --> 17:56.698
Why are you going to list Dean?

17:57.139 --> 17:58.681
Because, Dean, I was a ghostwriter.

17:59.362 --> 17:59.663
So what?

18:00.084 --> 18:01.426
He's with Eugene so-and-so.

18:01.446 --> 18:02.608
This is with Bill Russell.

18:02.628 --> 18:02.788
Right.

18:03.630 --> 18:12.825
Well, actually, Alice is telling me that Dean now would like to have me listed here, because then he could revive the book a little more, but we haven't done that yet.

18:13.447 --> 18:18.292
But all along, after every book, I would ask Alice, do you think I can do King?

18:18.412 --> 18:27.262
Because I always wanted to go back and do King because I knew that that was what had redirected the interest, my life's interest.

18:27.322 --> 18:28.683
So finally she said, okay, right?

18:28.743 --> 18:29.684
Finally she said, okay.

18:29.704 --> 18:30.765
She kept saying, you don't have enough.

18:30.785 --> 18:32.107
This is going to be a long project.

18:32.187 --> 18:33.708
I can't get you enough money.

18:33.748 --> 18:36.111
Can you do it on $10,000?

18:36.451 --> 18:36.872
No, no.

18:36.972 --> 18:42.778
I finally wound up getting, I think, $150,000 for three years.

18:43.231 --> 18:45.237
That's terrific.

18:47.202 --> 18:48.907
You had four or five books under your belt.

18:48.927 --> 18:56.127
I had four or five books under my belt, and I've got to do all the research out of that and travel all over the country.

18:56.663 --> 19:00.407
I get 85 for the book I'm doing now, and I've already, we just did that tax.

19:00.427 --> 19:01.769
I'm sure you spent most of it.

19:01.789 --> 19:05.874
I spent $22,000 last year just in traveling research.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.776
No, it's unbelievable.

19:07.836 --> 19:09.678
And now you see how we don't make any money.

19:11.420 --> 19:22.573
So all of this, I'm sorry, began with your question of how did you divide it into more than one book, and that is when I had that money, and I thought I was going to do it.

19:22.593 --> 19:24.235
That's what I like to talk about, because I have a book.

19:24.255 --> 19:24.375
Right.

19:24.575 --> 19:31.523
I was going to do this in three years, and three years into it, I had written this massive manuscript, and I knew there was no way.

19:31.763 --> 19:34.466
About 83 years into it.

19:34.486 --> 19:35.026
Oh, wait a minute.

19:35.067 --> 19:38.170
Now, what year did you sign for this?

19:38.190 --> 19:39.211
82.

19:39.231 --> 19:39.291
82.

19:39.331 --> 19:41.293
And Parting the Waters was published in 88.

19:42.274 --> 19:42.915
So six years.

19:42.955 --> 19:47.720
It took twice as long as I'm supposed to do the whole thing to publish the first volume.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.462
That book did very well, and I want to fill it in.

19:49.482 --> 19:49.863
Right.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.865
Well, I know, but they didn't know that.

19:53.735 --> 20:02.144
I'm saying the impasse was when I go to them and I say I've written 900 pages of manuscript and I'm in 1961.

20:02.324 --> 20:04.326
So what happened?

20:05.448 --> 20:12.195
We were at Loggerheads and I went and wrote magazine articles because they wouldn't advance any more money.

20:12.395 --> 20:14.357
I said it's got to be two volumes.

20:14.377 --> 20:16.840
There's no way I'm going to get it in one volume.

20:16.860 --> 20:19.843
It'll be a 3,000 page manuscript.

20:20.110 --> 20:29.841
They said, books about race don't sell very well, and massive books about race sell less well, and massive two-volume books about race are a joke.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.443
Collections of columns.

20:31.463 --> 20:31.764
Right.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.486
That's what they do about the worst.

20:33.506 --> 20:35.047
Right.

20:36.329 --> 20:46.641
Anyway, we were renegotiating all this, and while we were at Ladderheads, I had to quit and go back and write magazine articles and freelance for a time, but then we came to an agreement.

20:47.448 --> 20:48.890
So I finished pouring the water.

20:49.010 --> 20:50.371
They don't understand that, do they?

20:50.631 --> 20:52.874
I just did a piece for Civilization of Maurice Sendak.

20:53.915 --> 20:56.217
I got five grand for that.

20:56.978 --> 20:59.621
And my editor says, well, geez, isn't this going in the book?

20:59.721 --> 21:01.603
I said, of course it's going in the book.

21:01.643 --> 21:04.106
I said, but I need money to live.

21:04.326 --> 21:06.989
They don't understand that at all, do they?

21:08.331 --> 21:11.013
We are very peculiar and misunderstood trade.

21:12.695 --> 21:17.100
Now, for this book, it was their idea to cut it off.

21:17.890 --> 21:20.853
Sure, because the first one did well.

21:21.274 --> 21:25.459
Because I was pretty much invested in sticking with it, and I only had the manuscript.

21:25.479 --> 21:27.241
It was only 1,400 pages long.

21:27.261 --> 21:28.242
It hadn't gotten that far.

21:28.262 --> 21:31.145
Yeah, so where part of the waters was, and I cut it.

21:31.706 --> 21:34.589
This is down to about 900 pages, I would say, manuscript pages, no?

21:34.669 --> 21:40.135
Yeah, something like that.

21:40.621 --> 21:45.211
So the cutting was not quite as bad on this one as it was on the first one.

21:45.231 --> 21:46.153
But it was their idea.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.438
They said, you've got a perfect breaking off point in 65.

21:48.719 --> 21:50.422
You're not going to be able to get it to 68.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.048
It's been nine years, or almost nine years then.

21:53.289 --> 21:54.411
By the way, it's been eight years.

21:54.998 --> 21:56.800
and you really should get another volume out.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.563
We think this is a natural breaking point, and I agree.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.784
So it was their idea to do three.

22:01.024 --> 22:05.308
And so the titles, you obviously have the title for the next volume already.

22:05.328 --> 22:06.830
They're all out of Exodus.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.892
I'm kind of an Exodus person.

22:10.453 --> 22:19.422
Would you describe this as an exercise in journalism, literary journalism, or is it, I mean, it's certainly not, I mean, the scholarship is excellent.

22:20.564 --> 22:22.506
I really spend, I spend a lot of time with sources.

22:22.566 --> 22:24.988
I like to see what you've done with the sources.

22:25.643 --> 22:36.354
Well, I think that particularly in race, I don't know, I have this maxim, I think that libraries preserve what cultures are comfortable with.

22:38.156 --> 22:39.858
It's a repository of comfort.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.980
That's what you expect to find in libraries.

22:42.180 --> 22:49.508
And we're not comfortable historically with race, and so you don't find a lot of

22:50.045 --> 22:56.375
primary, first-hand information about race and libraries, and so... They were research libraries.

22:56.395 --> 22:57.276
Research libraries.

22:57.296 --> 23:12.379
For example, Reconstruction in the Civil War, had it not been for the accident of the Depression and the WPA oral histories, which went out and did oral histories with ex-slaves in the 30s, by which time the only ex-slaves there were were 70 and 80 years old.

23:12.399 --> 23:16.525
That's all we had as a primary resource material about what it was like to be a slave.

23:16.792 --> 23:23.058
because the libraries in the 1860s, 1870s, 1880s, nobody was collecting that kind of material.

23:23.338 --> 23:24.119
It's too sensitive.

23:24.719 --> 23:42.576
And I think that we have a... You think that was... I don't think it even occurred to them that this is an important epoch in the history of freedom in America and somebody ought to be out collecting material about what it was like to have been a slave or what reconstruction was like.

23:42.616 --> 23:43.997
Were they collecting anything else?

23:44.534 --> 23:47.619
at that time in an oral manner?

23:48.501 --> 23:52.748
Maybe the whole concept of the oral biography hadn't... Well, it is new.

23:52.828 --> 23:54.591
Yeah, there are a lot of things that push that.

23:55.453 --> 23:56.995
Well, there were people writing letters.

23:57.516 --> 24:09.917
There was an awful lot of material for later historians to work about, refracting off of most other topics from the period of 1860 to 1880.

24:10.319 --> 24:20.750
But if you were interested in what it was like, what the culture of slavery was like, or how it went from being a slave culture to a reconstruction culture, there wasn't a whole hell of a lot to write with.

24:20.831 --> 24:24.915
So where did you get your primary sources?

24:24.935 --> 24:27.358
I got another question for you when you're done with that.

24:28.859 --> 24:39.211
I think there's no substitute for lots of interviews in oral histories, which is why I was kind of obsessed to try to complete this while so many of the people are still alive.

24:39.691 --> 24:40.292
You taped them?

24:40.576 --> 24:42.478
I do, when I can.

24:42.499 --> 24:43.680
To transcribe them yourself?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.381
Absolutely.

24:46.203 --> 24:57.198
I did get a grant after parting the waters for somebody to do, for two years, the Ford Foundation paid for somebody to transcribe some of the interviews for Pillar of Fire.

24:57.899 --> 25:08.052
But, you know, the problem is, particularly these Southerners, they can't understand the Southern accents, and then I've got these Muslims, and they can't understand the Muslims, and

25:08.268 --> 25:09.990
You know, they can't understand the rabbi.

25:11.451 --> 25:13.414
My first book, I had a woman doing mine.

25:13.814 --> 25:15.015
She made more of it.

25:15.436 --> 25:18.279
She got more money than I did.

25:18.299 --> 25:18.399
Yeah.

25:18.419 --> 25:19.420
And they're worthless.

25:19.741 --> 25:23.124
I mean, there's no substitute to doing it.

25:23.925 --> 25:26.708
I'm working with voice dictation now, by the way.

25:26.808 --> 25:28.010
It's still not there yet.

25:28.030 --> 25:28.270
Really?

25:28.470 --> 25:29.952
I listen to it, and it's hot.

25:29.972 --> 25:30.893
But the IBM one.

25:30.913 --> 25:32.014
But I think it's getting to it.

25:32.399 --> 25:34.442
a level of sophistication that might be pretty good.

25:34.462 --> 25:47.082
You know, I never thought of this before, but in the ghost written books, I worked with tape recorders too because I was trying to learn the speech patterns because I was trying to write in somebody else's voice.

25:48.404 --> 25:55.656
And actually that's a very useful exercise because when you do transcribe somebody,

25:56.210 --> 26:06.084
that you interview on tape and you have a quote that you want to do, if you do this for yourself, you're familiar with, you can almost recognize a phony quote from somebody else quote somebody that doesn't sound right.

26:06.104 --> 26:11.432
That's not Ralph Abernathy's language, or that's not John Lewis's language, and you can go back and double check them.

26:11.452 --> 26:14.156
So, yeah, there's not much substitute for that.

26:14.176 --> 26:24.411
But of course, aside from interviews, we do have the wonderful anti-constitutional but historically valuable invention of the wiretap.

26:24.847 --> 26:28.891
So government archives are very, very useful, and government documents are very useful.

26:28.911 --> 26:30.572
Did you have trouble getting access?

26:30.592 --> 26:31.833
To some, yeah.

26:31.853 --> 26:33.154
Did you have trouble with the King family?

26:34.435 --> 26:38.179
I mean, they've made it really tough for people to see this stuff.

26:38.199 --> 26:41.281
Not so much up here for you, but the stuff down in Atlanta.

26:41.582 --> 26:43.543
Well, everybody's had trouble with the King family.

26:43.563 --> 26:45.765
I've been thrown out of that library a number of times.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.127
But fortunately, I was there.

26:48.187 --> 26:49.409
I was one of their first customers.

26:49.429 --> 26:51.390
They opened in 1982, and I was there.

26:51.510 --> 26:54.533
And I think I spent years on and off in there.

26:54.985 --> 27:01.054
I got my research done before then money.

27:01.635 --> 27:03.698
Basically, it has a life cycle.

27:03.758 --> 27:09.407
After King was killed, there were all these Ford Foundation and labor unions and everybody rushed in with money.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.570
By the 80s, it started to run out.

27:11.610 --> 27:14.575
Then they started trying to figure out their ways to make money out of what they had.

27:14.775 --> 27:17.099
What they had was the archives.

27:17.139 --> 27:18.381
There's really no way to make money.

27:18.401 --> 27:22.427
They're trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip.

27:22.627 --> 27:25.412
But fortunately, I had most of my work done before that.

27:27.675 --> 27:36.009
So I haven't had that much trouble, although I testified on behalf of BU up here that the papers should not go back.

27:36.129 --> 27:49.191
And really, I was the representational person because all the King Scholars who went down there have been hounded, including some of the people who are most loyal to them and even who work for them.

27:49.576 --> 27:55.064
They're just incapable of, you know, their attitude is the opposite of what an archive ought to be.

27:55.084 --> 27:57.788
They want to control what's coming out and get a piece of it if they can.

27:58.650 --> 28:00.733
And even influence the way it is.

28:01.254 --> 28:11.229
And along the way, it takes forever to make a decision, yes or no, just because they enjoy the fact that, you know, that you're beholden to them and have to wait.

28:11.449 --> 28:13.572
They like the cut of your jigs.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.415
So it'll wait for a long time.

28:15.698 --> 28:34.213
So lots of people had suffered terribly down there, and when she moved to get the materials back from BU down there, I testified against it on the ground that I thought it would be very harmful if they had a monopoly on their historical resources because...

28:35.003 --> 28:40.509
because the attitude that they had down there was kind of inimicable to what an archive ought to be.

28:40.789 --> 28:42.371
Well, he'd slam the stuff over.

28:42.591 --> 28:43.112
Right.

28:43.132 --> 28:46.335
Well, she had to impeach her own husband because he had to say he wasn't in his right mind.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.157
There's no ambiguity in the document at all.

28:48.177 --> 28:49.659
I mean, it's pretty clear, isn't it?

28:49.679 --> 28:55.665
Yeah, but it's very, very controversial because most people don't want to be on the wrong side of the sainted widow.

28:56.446 --> 29:00.250
So Julian Bond, he wouldn't testify, but he's now joined me.

29:00.270 --> 29:03.053
We've been publicly...

29:03.488 --> 29:06.511
I've kind of spoken out on behalf of others on this.

29:06.531 --> 29:09.254
But yeah, so that archive is rough.

29:09.294 --> 29:10.835
There are a lot of places that you have to go.

29:10.855 --> 29:12.317
You have to go to the presidential libraries.

29:12.337 --> 29:13.177
You have to go to the FBI.

29:13.197 --> 29:21.666
You have to go to the major places where there are collections of the figures of Philip Randolph and Roy Wilkins and any number of other people.

29:21.786 --> 29:28.272
And the King Library is valuable, but I'm really glad that I did my research when I did because I don't think I could do it now.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.514
I don't think I could do it now.

29:30.534 --> 29:32.196
You're going to go out in a few minutes.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.374
Another thing about it, it's 30 years now.

29:35.394 --> 29:37.216
I mean, when you break off, it's 1968.

29:37.296 --> 29:39.618
It is really history now, isn't it?

29:39.798 --> 29:42.241
Yeah, it is, and I've noticed that it's changed.

29:43.822 --> 29:50.909
I'm just waking up to the fact that it's changed, even in the nine years since Parting the Waters, because another half-generation has passed by.

29:50.989 --> 29:58.517
And when Parting the Waters came, I'm just thinking this now, because I've been out on the road a little bit in the last month.

29:58.537 --> 30:00.799
It's only been a month, basically.

30:02.517 --> 30:16.513
that when Parting the Waters came out, most of the people who interviewed me were in their 30s, and they remembered this as something that affected them, and it was a rekindling of a memory.

30:16.573 --> 30:21.919
Now most of the people who interview me are in their 30s, and this is like, why should I care about this?

30:23.120 --> 30:26.644
I was asked on the air in San Francisco by an anchor person.

30:26.764 --> 30:32.170
Admittedly, it was TV, where you get the shallowest airbrush.

30:32.858 --> 30:43.390
She said, I see here that Dr. King was involved with J. Edgar Hoover.

30:43.430 --> 30:45.152
Was he affiliated with the FBI?

30:46.153 --> 30:49.718
And this woman had no idea that J. Edgar Hoover was affiliated with the FBI.

30:49.738 --> 30:50.418
And this is true.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.502
That's embarrassing.

30:53.522 --> 30:58.748
But, I mean, this really is history now, and now, rather than recapturing

30:59.133 --> 31:09.448
a period that everybody knows is significant, my task in trying to promote the book is to tell people to whom they never heard of any of this why it's important.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.591
And that's a different... In only nine years.

31:11.651 --> 31:13.654
But those people aren't going to buy the book, though.

31:13.674 --> 31:13.895
Right.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.137
Buy a big book like this.

31:15.357 --> 31:21.746
People who have to know who Martin Luther King is, who was... Well, it was terrible out there.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.329
We were going to walk out.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.330
We still had a minute.

31:24.496 --> 31:33.109
Okay, we'll be there in a minute.

31:34.470 --> 31:35.532
You want to sign this book for me?

31:35.592 --> 31:35.852
Sure.

31:36.333 --> 31:42.102
Did you come into this with any kind of a... What's the word I'm looking for?

31:42.943 --> 31:45.486
Not an agenda, but you must have come in with some baggage, right?

31:45.507 --> 31:46.688
You must have certainly had a point of view.

31:48.331 --> 31:50.514
You mean when I started all these years ago?

31:50.534 --> 31:52.056
Yeah.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.063
Yeah, I admired the period.

31:55.123 --> 32:11.345
I felt, but a lot of it was just sheer respect, that I felt that the movement had enough power to change the direction of my life's interest when I'm not looking for it to do that, and I'm not part of it.

32:11.426 --> 32:21.199
I'm a white Southerner growing up in the segregated South, so I figured this thing, I had the respect for its power, and I admired it, but...

32:23.255 --> 32:28.182
I didn't have any sense of the depth of it or the sophistication of it.

32:28.262 --> 32:37.115
I tended to belittle it like most white students who saw it as a kind of an infantile version of our really complex anti-war movement.

32:37.756 --> 32:43.445
And now I see this as much more complex than what we did and what we did was to really screw up a lot of the things that they did.

32:43.465 --> 32:51.777
So, yeah, I came into it with a respect and a kind of a preconception and an admiration.

32:52.128 --> 32:57.126
Let me make sure I spell your last name.

32:57.146 --> 32:59.033
Okay, well that's good, thanks.
