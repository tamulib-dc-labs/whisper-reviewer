WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:04.011
But I didn't miss anything.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.813
I knew that it was an hour.

00:06.113 --> 00:07.956
I have this success.

00:08.777 --> 00:09.358
There we go.

00:09.378 --> 00:09.478
Okay.

00:09.498 --> 00:12.983
The, the, oh, I'm terrible.

00:13.003 --> 00:17.769
Did you have some coffee, some tea, some iced tea, nothing?

00:17.789 --> 00:18.510
You've got everything.

00:18.730 --> 00:19.872
I'm sure you do.

00:19.892 --> 00:20.333
Okay.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.175
I'm fine.

00:22.315 --> 00:32.569
One of the interesting byproducts of this was that, of that, the way that artist grew, was that he was greatly respected in the British publishing community, not just the

00:32.971 --> 00:41.825
And a wonderful opportunity came as a result of that.

00:43.848 --> 00:57.730
Penguin had its own very fine art list, which had begun in the early 40s, I guess.

00:58.992 --> 01:17.793
think of his name in a minute, but the man who was a very fine immigrant German scholar, was the advisor to the house, and he started commissioning books, and he eventually became the Pelican History of Art, a multi-volume set.

01:17.813 --> 01:18.954
Oh, beautiful.

01:19.434 --> 01:19.675
Yeah.

01:19.695 --> 01:24.460
And in the old days, they were these thick,

01:24.592 --> 01:31.598
know, hugely authoritative volumes with all the illustrations in the back and a beautifully produced slip case and everything and so on.

01:31.618 --> 01:53.738
Well, sometime at the end of the 80s, I think it was, it was, it had become apparent to the people at Penguin, which by this time was part of a vast international conglomerate, because it had been bought up by Pearson and so on, and that they had this thing that they didn't know what to do with it, and it was losing money.

01:54.477 --> 02:24.417
They decided that, well, first of all, it had been very important to the man who started Penguin, and they said, well, we could just put it out of print, or we could sell some of the books off to the highest bidder, but they decided not to do that, and they put it up for adoption, as it were, which really meant they turned to John Nickel and said, would you take this and

02:25.088 --> 02:26.850
go on publishing it.

02:26.870 --> 02:33.680
And so, um, a lot of negotiations and so on, but in the end, that's exactly what happened.

02:33.980 --> 02:44.695
And, uh, he took it over, and, um, the result is, uh, a brand new Pelican history of art published by Yale.

02:44.715 --> 02:50.643
The name was kept, and, um, alas, most of my books are still in storage, but I have some of these here.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.627
And in place of the, um,

02:55.278 --> 03:08.653
In place of the books with all the plates in the back and so on, he produced a whole new series with the illustrations in place and architecture and so on.

03:08.673 --> 03:10.115
Is this a Yale book?

03:10.455 --> 03:10.976
Yeah.

03:11.777 --> 03:17.784
So there's a shelf this long now of these books.

03:18.164 --> 03:24.171
And then...

03:24.607 --> 03:46.135
About five years ago, the other great Pelican series, which was sort of our architecture of England, of every borough and so on, this enormous series of 200 volumes.

03:46.215 --> 03:47.577
So are they called Pelicans?

03:47.677 --> 03:51.862
Yeah, they're called the Yale University Press Pelican History.

03:51.882 --> 03:52.403
There you go.

03:52.805 --> 03:55.089
It's just, again, a targeted opportunity.

03:55.129 --> 03:58.013
That might even be the title of a chapter.

03:58.053 --> 03:59.175
Yeah, yeah.

03:59.495 --> 04:17.243
So those are sort of three, the three legs to the stool that was building the past those years was the art publishing program, the educational list, and

04:19.163 --> 04:22.748
And I guess you could probably call it the trade list, because that's what it was.

04:22.828 --> 04:37.370
Because we were the, probably, I think it's fair to say, we were the pioneers in, among universal prices, in having a regular and significant list that we could sell to the trade every year.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.572
And we did it successfully.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.816
So you predate Oxford in this, you think?

04:41.836 --> 04:43.178
Oh, no, I'm talking about American prices.

04:43.198 --> 04:43.819
Because Oxford is.

04:44.200 --> 04:44.701
Absolutely.

04:44.881 --> 04:45.362
Oxford is.

04:46.223 --> 04:47.685
You might as well call them trade hosts.

04:48.003 --> 04:50.966
A lot of people do, and so on.

04:51.326 --> 04:56.431
I mean, you get that Oxford catalog, and of course there are those, the academic titles.

04:56.451 --> 04:56.631
Yeah.

04:56.651 --> 04:58.893
Do they even do a separate academic catalog?

04:58.913 --> 04:59.674
Yes, they do.

04:59.694 --> 05:00.534
They do, yeah.

05:00.554 --> 05:02.376
And these books carry things.

05:02.396 --> 05:02.836
I mean, it is.

05:03.958 --> 05:05.999
It's the greatest publisher there ever was.

05:06.079 --> 05:07.000
I mean, it's amazing.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.964
Yeah, but... Among American houses, because you have to make that clear.

05:11.064 --> 05:12.665
Yeah, you absolutely have to make that clear.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.609
And, you know, they're...

05:18.007 --> 05:21.752
Differences are vast between the Oxfords and the others.

05:21.892 --> 05:28.780
I mean, Cambridge is tiny in comparison, but Oxford has this enormous list.

05:28.921 --> 05:38.953
Basically, it makes all its profits on its textbooks in Nigeria and places like that, and the rest is gravy, really.

05:38.973 --> 05:39.794
Even the reference list.

05:39.814 --> 05:39.954
Really?

05:40.215 --> 05:41.756
Even the Bibles.

05:41.997 --> 05:42.357
Okay.

05:42.738 --> 05:43.799
This is Oxford or Cambridge?

05:43.819 --> 05:44.139
Oxford.

05:45.081 --> 05:46.242
So they make their money?

05:46.458 --> 05:48.801
And the places you wouldn't expect them to be.

05:48.821 --> 05:50.303
Well, they make their money where the empire was.

05:51.124 --> 05:51.764
And still.

05:51.824 --> 05:52.005
Yeah.

05:52.165 --> 05:53.687
Wow.

05:54.307 --> 05:55.609
Cambridge can't get a piece of that?

05:55.629 --> 05:56.069
They don't.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.151
They never seem to be able to.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.333
Cambridge almost seems provincial.

05:59.493 --> 05:59.974
It does.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.577
And very conservative and whatnot.

06:02.817 --> 06:10.827
And it's a successful operation, but it's nothing with the flair, the excitement, the dynamic.

06:11.047 --> 06:11.748
The attitude.

06:11.828 --> 06:12.229
Yeah.

06:12.729 --> 06:13.290
Yeah.

06:13.550 --> 06:15.132
It is a...

06:16.124 --> 06:17.947
They are fascinating places to study.

06:18.047 --> 06:38.316
I actually paid a lot of attention to them because they both had American operations, and since we were the only American press with a British operation, I watched, saw how they ran them, and tried to learn from their mistakes and their successes and so on, and it was instructive.

06:38.376 --> 06:40.739
You're the only one with a London operation?

06:40.939 --> 06:41.440
To speak of.

06:42.061 --> 06:42.882
Yeah, no kidding.

06:42.902 --> 06:47.488
Because you see so many of these, they'll say, Berkeley in London.

06:47.628 --> 06:48.890
Yeah, yeah.

06:50.352 --> 06:55.479
They basically have a trade office there, a sales office, and that's all.

06:55.719 --> 06:58.843
And I never give them that credit in my bibliographies, by the way.

06:58.863 --> 06:59.184
No, no.

06:59.204 --> 07:02.208
Because I say, first of all, it's a waste of ink, and it's Berkeley.

07:02.248 --> 07:02.888
Who are we kidding?

07:02.989 --> 07:03.689
Yeah, who are we kidding?

07:03.710 --> 07:04.210
Exactly.

07:05.051 --> 07:09.577
But at Yale, about a third... They do generate that.

07:09.717 --> 07:10.178
Actually...

07:10.310 --> 07:13.254
originate in London.

07:14.175 --> 07:18.641
So they have the authority to acquire and do all of the editorial work?

07:18.681 --> 07:19.863
They do the editorial work.

07:19.903 --> 07:27.513
The acquiring the seal of approval still comes from here.

07:31.939 --> 07:39.709
I suppose it's conceivable that at some point there would be a situation like Oxford has, where there is a separate

07:40.229 --> 07:43.874
operation here, that they don't have to get the approval from over there.

07:44.274 --> 07:47.679
But it pretty much works.

07:48.460 --> 08:04.881
What I tried to do was just to give the London office, the people there, the sense that this was their own show, and that they could be proud of it, and... Well, did they have their own violin?

08:06.283 --> 08:06.603
Yes.

08:07.464 --> 08:08.886
Yes, they did.

08:09.693 --> 08:18.085
There was also a time when it gets rolled in with ours, but yes, they had their own bottom line and they had their own sort of managing board.

08:19.126 --> 08:21.309
So they were accountable to New Haven, in other words.

08:21.329 --> 08:21.790
Ultimately.

08:22.611 --> 08:35.329
And the way we... Yale University Press London is set up as a charitable trust in the United Kingdom, which is...

08:35.680 --> 08:47.617
the exact equivalent of the standing that Oxford and Cambridge have in this company where they are tax exempt publishers.

08:47.637 --> 08:49.600
It's such a good pro quo.

08:49.660 --> 08:49.960
It is.

08:50.040 --> 08:57.631
Well, I went out and I got that for Yale, because we were beginning to make enough money that it looked like it would be a problem.

08:57.891 --> 09:02.498
And so London has its own board.

09:03.035 --> 09:05.518
and it has outside directors and so on.

09:07.200 --> 09:12.706
But the way I set it up, I'm the chairman of the, I was the chairman of the London board, so there is a good deal of control.

09:12.806 --> 09:20.736
But, um, the, um, you know, they, they, they act with a considerable amount of independence.

09:20.756 --> 09:23.198
This is much more important than I realize.

09:23.239 --> 09:26.102
Absolutely, absolutely.

09:26.602 --> 09:31.388
And, and, uh, um, somewhere down the line, if you, if you, you know,

09:32.178 --> 09:33.040
took it arbitrarily.

09:33.080 --> 09:40.894
What were the 100 most important books in the last 50 years or something, you'd see a significant number of them would be coming from there.

09:40.994 --> 09:41.194
Really?

09:41.975 --> 09:42.076
Yeah.

09:42.096 --> 09:43.097
In addition to art books?

09:43.538 --> 09:46.443
Well, no, I would count the art books as... But in addition to?

09:46.463 --> 09:48.407
Or you would say those primarily would be?

09:48.447 --> 09:52.414
They would be primarily art books, but there were some very fine other books.

09:52.613 --> 10:02.305
And then, of course, we haven't even touched on the Chinese books and the Annals of Communism, which is really a brazen, kind of a ballsy thing.

10:02.325 --> 10:04.107
Yeah, yeah.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.290
And there's a risk involved there.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.536
You think you know what you're getting.

10:12.077 --> 10:14.721
You must spend time with Jonathan Brent.

10:15.482 --> 10:15.942
Jonathan?

10:16.563 --> 10:17.444
B-R-E-N-T.

10:17.464 --> 10:17.564
Okay.

10:18.265 --> 10:19.667
And he's the...

10:20.018 --> 10:23.483
He's editorial director in New Haven, so he's the top editorial person.

10:23.503 --> 10:24.244
I met him this morning.

10:24.304 --> 10:24.725
Yeah.

10:24.805 --> 10:25.005
Right.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.628
And let's get together a little bit very shortly.

10:26.728 --> 10:27.449
Oh, okay, yeah.

10:27.489 --> 10:27.910
But go ahead.

10:28.070 --> 10:28.391
Yeah.

10:28.631 --> 10:33.879
Well, he comes from a very well-known family in the book business.

10:33.919 --> 10:38.405
His father is Stuart Brandt, who had a famous bookshop in Chicago for many, many, many years.

10:39.467 --> 10:44.555
And Jonathan is a trained scholar, Ph.D.

10:44.575 --> 10:49.502
from Columbia, and his dissertation on Henry James.

10:49.820 --> 10:57.271
And he got interested early on in Russian literature and some Slavic and Soviet studies generally.

10:57.611 --> 11:12.533
And he had been teaching at Northwestern, but came to, and then took a job, a sort of part-time job, at the little press they have there.

11:12.854 --> 11:15.778
And then he became the head of it and was looking to do more.

11:15.818 --> 11:17.681
And we were looking at that time for someone.

11:17.701 --> 11:19.303
And he came to Yale.

11:19.435 --> 11:39.198
He's made a huge difference, and he's an imaginative and extremely aggressive editor, and one of the very first things that happened was an opportunity that led to the Annals of Communism.

11:39.639 --> 11:42.422
He came, and he'd been in touch with various things, and someone

11:43.246 --> 11:52.440
some scholar, friend of his, said that one of the Eastern European archives was going to open soon, and did he know about that, and wouldn't that be kind of interesting?

11:52.480 --> 12:01.454
And he went, and then he heard that something much bigger was going to happen in Moscow.

12:01.474 --> 12:08.986
And I remember he'd been at the press about three weeks, and he came and he said, this is what could happen in Moscow.

12:09.066 --> 12:11.430
I might be able to get a crack at the

12:12.153 --> 12:15.557
at the archives of the Soviet Union.

12:15.857 --> 12:19.442
And so I said, okay, go to Moscow and see what you can do.

12:19.502 --> 12:24.948
And he speaks sort of serviceable Russian and can get around, and he knew a lot of people.

12:25.028 --> 12:29.814
And there were a lot of publishers in on it at first, spending a lot of money.

12:29.934 --> 12:31.496
But in the end, he got this thing.

12:31.856 --> 12:38.544
And again, targets of opportunity.

12:38.804 --> 12:41.147
He tells a wonderful story, and you should hear it direct.

12:41.397 --> 12:45.743
of being taken on a tour of the Comintern archives.

12:46.805 --> 12:49.569
Remember the ones that were exporting revolution?

12:50.090 --> 13:05.232
Well, a guy was showing him, well, this is where the stuff on Germany is, and this is where the stuff on the Italian Communist Party is, and finally John said, well, where's the American Communist Party stuff?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.556
And they found it in a dusty corner somewhere.

13:07.576 --> 13:10.560
They didn't think it was very important.

13:10.895 --> 13:13.157
He said, well, I'll be kind of curious to know what's in there.

13:13.177 --> 13:16.401
And so they started opening up these, blowing the dust off.

13:16.481 --> 13:20.605
They said some of the stuff hadn't been touched since World War II.

13:21.586 --> 13:32.817
If you remember, Stalin closed down the Comintern in a sort of gesture to his allies, and it wasn't very important anyway.

13:33.058 --> 13:35.600
Well, there'd be some names in there, wouldn't there?

13:35.620 --> 13:36.221
Yeah, and there were.

13:36.321 --> 13:40.345
And that's where he began to find some of this stuff.

13:41.287 --> 13:41.587
Good.

13:42.108 --> 13:42.328
Wow.

13:43.310 --> 13:52.583
He did a very good job, and in the end, a couple of publishers spent huge sums of money, but were unable to work with the Russians, and they trusted him.

13:52.783 --> 13:56.107
It is interesting that a trade publisher could do that.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.389
A couple of them tried.

13:57.850 --> 14:00.073
Because they certainly would have had more money than you guys.

14:01.134 --> 14:09.606
At one point, we got access to one of the big archives, and I remember, Jonathan, we raised some money, because we went to some people, but...

14:11.729 --> 14:22.220
He gave them a Xerox machine and something else, and not quite a bunch of light bulbs, but it was close to that.

14:22.861 --> 14:28.767
Somebody else was in there waving a million-dollar check, but they didn't want it.

14:28.787 --> 14:29.488
They were afraid of it.

14:29.508 --> 14:31.910
They didn't want to be bought and so on.

14:31.930 --> 14:34.393
Yeah, but they certainly wanted the Western currency.

14:34.413 --> 14:35.534
Yeah, but they didn't take it.

14:35.794 --> 14:36.555
That's amazing.

14:36.755 --> 14:43.823
So ask him, and he'll tell you that he's a great storyteller, and he'll be waving his hands in the air and doing Russian accents.

14:43.843 --> 14:49.210
So then, obviously we're going to have to have a second session on this, because I will probably scratch the surface.

14:50.611 --> 14:55.897
But when you stepped down, publishing were over 300 titles a year?

14:56.438 --> 14:56.538
Yeah.

14:56.558 --> 14:59.462
And how many a year were you publishing when you came in, do you think?

15:00.843 --> 15:03.546
Oh, um, 50?

15:03.667 --> 15:05.809
Yeah, so you... Oh, yeah.

15:05.849 --> 15:06.610
So this was part of...

15:07.265 --> 15:14.355
I don't mean to use the word vision, it's too much of a cliché, but you certainly had a vision.

15:14.375 --> 15:23.508
Well, I did, and I also thought when I looked at it's a heck of a lot more than just numbers, a lot of titles, but that's one of the most trade publishing houses.

15:24.209 --> 15:36.006
Well, it grew faster than I expected or intended, but there were so many good things to publish, and we were also

15:36.442 --> 15:44.053
We were growing by publishing more books every year and taking the money and putting it back in the... Well, publishing more successful books.

15:44.453 --> 15:45.635
More successful books, exactly.

15:45.655 --> 15:46.196
Yeah.

15:46.216 --> 15:48.199
But not stopping publishing the others.

15:49.100 --> 15:49.580
That's right.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.104
And that's what I was always proud of.

15:52.164 --> 16:06.364
And the other thing, of course, that made it possible to do that was the significant success of one of, in particular, one of the big educational projects, and that was the French textbook.

16:07.002 --> 16:10.307
That's another one I don't know about.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.969
Yeah, another one you need to know about.

16:12.269 --> 16:16.996
And I had talked about doing more textbooks.

16:17.557 --> 16:21.863
When I was at Harper, I was in the college department, so I knew about that.

16:22.664 --> 16:33.820
And I looked around to see where there were areas where we could do something that wouldn't require the kind of apparatus that a typical big college publisher has that

16:34.171 --> 16:39.076
huge sales force that goes out and a big toilet force at home that develops things and so on.

16:39.136 --> 16:42.060
So lots of upfront money and so on.

16:42.380 --> 16:46.685
And I knew we couldn't do that, but we were going to try to pick off some other areas.

16:47.385 --> 16:59.098
And I had a model in that instance, and it was the one trade house in New York that interacted with and worked very, very successfully with its own

16:59.433 --> 17:03.539
higher education publishing department, and that's W. W. Norton, the last independent.

17:03.999 --> 17:12.992
And at Norton, the same people often publish both kinds of books.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.714
That's interesting.

17:14.734 --> 17:14.854
Yeah.

17:15.075 --> 17:21.103
Obviously not in biology, let's say, but an editor working in music or history and psychology could be

17:21.505 --> 17:23.848
publishing for the trade and publishing books.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.229
I've just not heard of that before.

17:25.430 --> 17:26.170
And they do it.

17:26.471 --> 17:27.532
And Norton's a great place.

17:28.073 --> 17:29.174
Very, very successful.

17:29.254 --> 17:37.964
And there has been a kind of Yale-Norton connection over the long years.

17:39.146 --> 17:49.538
Back before, maybe in Chester's earliest days, one of the outside directors of the press, when it was a private company, was a man named Storer Lunt, who had been the

17:49.990 --> 17:55.618
the first head of Norton after the Norton, after Warder Norton died.

17:56.859 --> 18:07.874
His successor, George Brockway, was on my board for a long time, and then George's successor, Don Lamb, was the, followed him, and he and I worked very closely together.

18:07.914 --> 18:11.399
So, I mean, all together, it was about a 35 or 40-year connection.

18:11.739 --> 18:18.849
And I looked at what Norton did and how it worked together and said, well, we could take a page out of that and do it.

18:18.909 --> 18:19.069
And

18:19.370 --> 18:27.081
I'd asked George at one point about the mixing trade publishing with college publishing and whatnot, and he said, did you ever meet him?

18:27.101 --> 18:29.604
He's a salty, wonderful character, terrific publisher.

18:30.786 --> 18:41.321
And he said, well, at Norton, the college department and Dr. Freud account for 51 percent of the profit.

18:41.781 --> 18:48.010
Okay, so the trade department was not, but they had, of course, the standard Freud

18:48.310 --> 18:58.404
edition, you know, and the good college department, especially their famous Norton book of this and, you know, those English anthologies.

18:58.744 --> 19:00.286
Yeah, yeah.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.468
I mean, all is wonderful.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.169
The book of the dead.

19:02.189 --> 19:03.691
I mean, there were different kinds of Norton books.

19:03.791 --> 19:04.011
Yeah.

19:04.131 --> 19:06.795
So they were, again, they were a model.

19:06.815 --> 19:10.900
The Norton anthology of Afro-American literature became a standard.

19:11.181 --> 19:11.361
Yeah.

19:11.381 --> 19:12.102
Right when it came out.

19:12.202 --> 19:12.903
Right, right.

19:13.083 --> 19:17.389
And their Norton anthology of everything.

19:18.095 --> 19:20.918
book and so on.

19:21.358 --> 19:22.179
It was just fabulous.

19:22.219 --> 19:26.023
And so we picked up on that and did it.

19:26.083 --> 19:42.100
And at any rate, we got a hold of a textbook prospect that had been being developed at Yale and was actually under contract to another publisher, to Norton.

19:42.540 --> 19:47.005
But they thought it was too risky, kind of experimental, and it was going to be done

19:47.963 --> 19:55.213
with a huge audio-visual component and so on, and they backed out, and we signed it up.

19:55.234 --> 20:17.025
Well, at the same time we signed it up, they got backing from the Annenberg Corporation, and Annenberg paid for the creation of a, it was a 50-week, 50-hour-long television programs teaching introductory French.

20:17.495 --> 20:23.083
And we got the contract for the print materials.

20:24.045 --> 20:35.982
And for the next 15 years, those textbooks, it was a very complicated package, brought in on average a million dollars a year.

20:37.204 --> 20:39.147
And again, so that was our bread and butter.

20:39.447 --> 20:43.694
So this is a text that you used to teach French at the college level?

20:43.714 --> 20:44.775
Yeah, French one.

20:44.916 --> 20:47.299
And usually taught as a

20:47.566 --> 20:58.158
So at Yale, you can take two kinds of French courses, but if you take the one that meets every day, and you really can speak French at the end of it, this is the one.

20:58.178 --> 20:59.559
My daughter teaches French, that's why I'm asking.

20:59.579 --> 21:00.260
Well, she might know it.

21:00.280 --> 21:03.764
The man's name was Pierre Capretz, and he's retired now.

21:03.864 --> 21:07.988
Pierre Capretz.

21:08.088 --> 21:09.930
C-A-P-R-E-T-Z.

21:10.871 --> 21:16.898
And it was kind of a maverick thing, but it did wonderfully for us.

21:17.857 --> 21:21.902
It was the mix of the three, trying to keep the balance.

21:21.962 --> 21:24.705
See, university presses don't do textbooks as a rule.

21:25.966 --> 21:27.087
And this was the exception.

21:27.107 --> 21:27.948
They had an opportunity.

21:28.029 --> 21:33.715
But you see, we were doing, to some extent, the three things that university presses didn't do.

21:34.496 --> 21:36.818
Trade books, textbooks, and art books.

21:37.279 --> 21:39.421
And that's how we made a success of it.

21:39.441 --> 21:45.248
So if you can think, and you don't have to come up with it now, but if you can think of a couple of books that you're just as proud of,

21:45.582 --> 22:02.125
having published, even though they didn't make you a million dollars a year, even if they only sold 2,000 copies, 3,000 copies, but that you were delighted that you published because you felt they had to be published, and where it demonstrates that it's not just... Oh, yeah.

22:02.205 --> 22:03.547
If you could think of a couple of those.

22:03.767 --> 22:05.970
Sure, I will.

22:06.203 --> 22:10.188
Those are the kinds of things I like to bring in, too.

22:10.308 --> 22:12.531
There have to be a couple of them.

22:12.551 --> 22:15.975
You just say, you know, this book probably isn't going to sell 500 copies.

22:15.995 --> 22:20.760
If it sells 1,000, we'll be thrilled, but we're going to be very happy that we published it.

22:20.780 --> 22:21.902
It deserves to be done.

22:22.282 --> 22:24.144
And that must happen all the time, I would say.

22:24.465 --> 22:29.751
And that's the luxury that you are able to afford yourself by being so successful elsewhere, it would seem to me.

22:29.771 --> 22:31.333
Right.

22:36.832 --> 22:42.780
Well, every year we publish one book like that, and that's the winning volume and the Younger Poets.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.301
Younger Poets.

22:43.481 --> 22:44.803
I have James Agee's.

22:45.143 --> 22:45.684
Yeah.

22:45.704 --> 22:50.290
I have all of Agee, and that's one of the great, great examples.

22:50.371 --> 22:56.860
It's a wonderful thing, and we do it because it's a great thing to do.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.962
It's probably the most valuable Agee book I own.

22:59.183 --> 23:00.184
Oh, I would think so.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.726
I would think so.

23:01.766 --> 23:04.510
Yeah.

23:05.553 --> 23:07.936
Quite a number, quite an impressive list of other people.

23:07.956 --> 23:09.417
You can find their first book there.

23:10.659 --> 23:12.761
Muriel Rukeyser and John Hollander.

23:12.981 --> 23:16.565
I've seen Hollander on Thursday.

23:17.326 --> 23:19.869
What should my angle be with Hollander?

23:19.949 --> 23:22.952
I think you would certainly want to talk about the series.

23:22.992 --> 23:27.937
He's always been close to it and likes it.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.024
I guess the other thing is that

23:36.130 --> 23:53.125
And he's been working with the press, publishing some different kinds of books about literature that aren't part of the trendy, lit crit stuff that you see so much of today.

23:55.427 --> 24:00.392
Did you see that review in the Sunday Times a month or two ago?

24:00.412 --> 24:00.512
Yeah.

24:00.532 --> 24:04.956
The Johns Hopkins book of—it absolutely slammed, but I forget.

24:05.577 --> 24:11.165
And it probably was unfair, but it's, there's just too much of that.

24:11.225 --> 24:19.295
And Hollander and a few other scholars are part of a kind of anti-establishment group within the literature community.

24:19.516 --> 24:24.903
And he and... Yeah, yeah.

24:25.344 --> 24:26.665
But it would be interesting.

24:26.685 --> 24:27.727
Just get his angle on it.

24:27.747 --> 24:29.449
I wouldn't want to put any words in.

24:29.589 --> 24:33.154
But with John, once you get...

24:33.978 --> 24:36.881
Because he's not a major player in the press, per se, but he's interesting.

24:36.901 --> 24:46.229
No, he's always been there on the side and cared about it and so on, and particularly the poetry series.

24:46.569 --> 24:59.861
And where I interacted with him mostly was as an advisor about poetry and help in picking the judges.

24:59.881 --> 25:01.943
You know, that's the way it works.

25:02.429 --> 25:05.653
of judges appointed for a period of time.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.455
And they've been wonderful judges over the years.

25:07.855 --> 25:09.697
Alden was a judge.

25:10.158 --> 25:10.398
Geez.

25:10.518 --> 25:10.818
Yeah.

25:10.838 --> 25:12.560
I mean, really, really good people.

25:12.600 --> 25:18.667
And Louise Glick is the current judge.

25:18.807 --> 25:23.813
And James Merrill was the judge.

25:24.173 --> 25:25.435
I mean, they've really been good.

25:25.635 --> 25:28.538
And what we do is...

25:29.041 --> 25:31.104
They pick anybody.

25:31.324 --> 25:36.271
And the press just supplies sort of administrative support.

25:36.551 --> 25:51.232
And every year the call goes out, submit volumes, and anyone under the age of 40 who hasn't had a volume of poetry published, you can have your work published, individual poems, can enter.

25:52.053 --> 25:58.862
And we get, on the average, about 600 to 700 volumes a year submitted.

25:59.197 --> 26:08.347
And we have a team of screeners that goes to work on it, and they divide the books into— Look at all the work that's done.

26:08.848 --> 26:14.034
I mean, this is absolutely no monetary gain here at all.

26:14.134 --> 26:15.135
None whatsoever.

26:15.355 --> 26:16.977
And if it sells 500 copies, maybe.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.519
Oh, it would be great.

26:18.539 --> 26:20.601
Yeah, never— But you never know.

26:20.762 --> 26:21.543
Once in a while.

26:21.603 --> 26:22.223
Once in a while.

26:22.303 --> 26:27.229
But that's a happy— But at a certain time of year,

26:27.547 --> 26:37.401
sort of early, late winter, early spring, it happens, you know, and they're gathering all this stuff together, and you see the, comes in, and then it gets put into three categories.

26:42.248 --> 26:45.533
Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso, that's where they, those are the categories.

26:45.553 --> 26:48.417
It's probably not as hard as some people might think, out of 600.

26:48.477 --> 26:49.318
No, and

26:49.585 --> 26:53.550
Most of the conscientious... Probably the last 20 or 30 that are... Yeah.

26:53.610 --> 26:57.656
Most of the conscientious... They're actually sampled from all of them, just to be good.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.658
But then they get down to it.

26:59.678 --> 27:07.949
And then, at the end, the judge makes his or her selection, and it goes to the winner, whose book is then published the following year.

27:08.270 --> 27:09.972
And it's wonderful.

27:10.292 --> 27:13.216
Books are always beautifully turned out and so on.

27:13.517 --> 27:18.343
And for years, the nicest thing I got to do every year was to

27:18.712 --> 27:21.915
call up the winner and tell him, you've won.

27:23.696 --> 27:27.680
It'll be interesting to find out how that got started.

27:27.700 --> 27:28.460
Yeah, yeah.

27:28.781 --> 27:39.189
John Kulka, K-U-L-K-A, is the editor who handles most of the literature stuff at the press now, and he's an interesting guy.

27:39.910 --> 27:48.297
He used to have his own short story series with Harcourt Brace that published sort of best new short stories kind of thing, and also was an executive with

27:48.631 --> 27:53.976
Barnes & Noble at one time, but he would be the guy to talk with about that.

27:54.136 --> 27:57.299
And then briefly, and then I'll be on my way because we've had a terrific session.

27:57.439 --> 27:58.680
I'd like to do this again.

27:59.761 --> 28:00.762
I'm also seeing Gaddis.

28:00.982 --> 28:01.743
Oh, good.

28:02.324 --> 28:04.626
And then what would you suggest as an angle with him?

28:05.707 --> 28:13.654
Well, I think the relationship between the press and the university is one that he could happily talk about.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.917
And he was also a

28:17.437 --> 28:22.682
a member in good standing of the Press's Publications Committee.

28:23.102 --> 28:26.265
Do you know how the governance of the press works?

28:26.305 --> 28:27.506
Well, just real quick.

28:29.328 --> 28:44.642
Because of its unusual history, being for many years a sort of separate part of the year, the press is technically run by a governing board, the Board of Governors, which consists of the

28:45.652 --> 28:58.869
president and other senior officers of the university, a group of senior faculty, and several outsiders, all of whom are publishers, usually half a dozen of each.

28:58.889 --> 29:02.934
And I am accountable, I was accountable to that board.

29:02.954 --> 29:13.768
Now, in fact, the president of the university, like a French king, could just get rid of the assembly of the board if he wanted to, but doesn't.

29:14.008 --> 29:15.490
And so it kind of works through it.

29:15.773 --> 29:18.316
And it's been a very good thing.

29:19.357 --> 29:41.983
It's something that Chester set up when the change was made, and it provided a kind of, a bit of a moat, so the press didn't find itself under the thumb of a particular dean with some issue or something like that, and could operate, also could have a little more freedom in the way it operates.

29:42.436 --> 29:53.834
One of the things it does do from time to time is turn down books written by members of the faculty and so on, and it needs to have a kind of protection and so on.

29:53.854 --> 30:06.433
So the governing board is important that you should be talking with some of its members, and the publications committee is actually a committee of that board.

30:06.974 --> 30:08.697
Sorry about that.

30:09.098 --> 30:13.945
By the way, did I put Frank Turner on the list of people that you should see?

30:14.025 --> 30:14.827
I think I did.

30:15.748 --> 30:21.396
But Frank Turner is a guy who's a historian at Yale.

30:21.757 --> 30:23.279
He's a press author.

30:23.379 --> 30:27.846
He was a longtime member of the publications committee.

30:30.129 --> 30:37.300
And he was, for a five-year period, the provost of the university, the number two

30:37.769 --> 30:48.399
officer at Yale, so he has a really good sense of sort of everything that happens, and he knows the press quite well, so he'd be a good person.

30:49.620 --> 30:54.004
Have there been any essays or written about the early history of the press?

30:54.105 --> 30:58.369
Any little profiles of any of the principles?

30:58.389 --> 31:00.671
Janice might be able to dig out one or two things.

31:00.691 --> 31:04.294
There's a couple of very brief things that Chester wrote.

31:04.595 --> 31:06.156
I mean, some of them would be

31:06.625 --> 31:08.989
A thousand words or something like that.

31:09.009 --> 31:09.810
A thousand words away.

31:10.491 --> 31:28.620
Well, he wrote one in about 1980, and it had to be withdrawn because there were so many errors and problems with it, and he never revised it.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.984
So it must be in the file somewhere.

31:31.144 --> 31:33.027
It's in the file somewhere.

31:33.087 --> 31:33.848
Was it a memoir?

31:34.250 --> 31:38.115
a history of the press, written in the first person.

31:39.958 --> 31:42.421
That's fabulous.

31:42.481 --> 31:44.203
It's not much, it's just a little thing.

31:44.404 --> 31:47.207
It's beautifully printed and so on.

31:47.247 --> 31:48.329
Oh, they printed it?

31:48.549 --> 31:49.490
Actually, press printed it.

31:49.510 --> 31:56.680
And then he, people kept, the phone started to ring, just distributed to people.

31:56.930 --> 31:57.871
I never said that.

31:57.951 --> 31:59.132
That didn't happen like that.

31:59.152 --> 32:03.296
I wouldn't trust it for a minute.

32:03.496 --> 32:06.238
Well, I wouldn't be looking for factual things anyway.

32:06.739 --> 32:09.602
Maybe if he got it wrong, it's interesting.

32:09.622 --> 32:10.642
It's interesting.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.044
It's the way he wanted it to be.

32:13.905 --> 32:23.594
And there's some, some of it would be some very nice stuff about the early years of the press, just about how starting out with the three of them working in one little room on Wall Street.

32:23.774 --> 32:24.815
That'll be there.

32:25.176 --> 32:25.536
Yeah.

32:25.735 --> 32:39.811
There are several versions of something like that, all of which accompany a document called The Story of Yale University Press.

32:39.831 --> 32:45.598
And The Story of Yale University Press was published sometime around 1920.

32:46.038 --> 32:49.582
Again, it's a book?

32:49.863 --> 32:51.945
It's a pamphlet.

32:52.027 --> 32:53.971
most beautifully printed thing you've ever seen.

32:54.371 --> 32:59.281
And we have quite a number of the original copies, and Janice can just give you one.

33:00.162 --> 33:13.748
It's anonymous, and it tells the story because around 1920, Charles Scribner gave a great deal of money to Princeton University Press, and they actually, he gave them a credit plan.

33:14.082 --> 33:17.025
And they hoped that somebody would do that for Yale.

33:17.045 --> 33:18.907
So this was a kind of little story.

33:18.927 --> 33:20.548
The Press was only... Like a prospectus.

33:20.568 --> 33:20.788
Yeah.

33:20.808 --> 33:22.170
The Press was only 15 years old.

33:22.490 --> 33:24.552
But in fact, it was written by Clarence Day.

33:25.193 --> 33:27.635
And it is a wonderful document.

33:28.896 --> 33:40.467
And it contains oft-quoted lines about the world of books by Clarence Day.

33:40.487 --> 33:43.650
And a copy of it used to hang over the...

33:43.985 --> 33:46.368
in the reception area of the press.

33:46.428 --> 33:48.051
The world of books is the most wonderful thing.

33:48.071 --> 33:48.511
It's there.

33:48.772 --> 33:49.973
It's there.

33:49.993 --> 33:51.375
That's the opening paragraph of it.

33:51.916 --> 33:52.096
Oh, cool.

33:52.116 --> 33:52.757
I'll get that.

33:52.777 --> 33:54.780
Yeah.

33:54.960 --> 34:03.352
And in various forms in which it was published, there is a two- or three-page history.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.516
And is there any good stuff in the correspondence, do you think?

34:07.205 --> 34:08.407
I think.

34:08.427 --> 34:09.088
I think so.

34:10.610 --> 34:16.037
The only, the editorial correspondence is mostly at the library, because that's the stuff that they kept.

34:16.057 --> 34:17.699
And I have a young woman working with me.

34:17.739 --> 34:19.281
Well, that should be worth poking around.

34:19.301 --> 34:21.364
That's what I told you actually to start looking at.

34:21.384 --> 34:22.005
Yeah, so.

34:22.105 --> 34:23.207
I said, look at the letters.

34:23.227 --> 34:23.968
Look at the letters.

34:23.988 --> 34:24.629
Look at the letters.

34:24.689 --> 34:32.359
Look at the letters that, um, to Eugene O'Neill's letters, or Carlotta O'Neill's letters would be interesting stuff.

34:33.220 --> 34:34.963
I'm going to send her an email to him.

34:35.003 --> 34:35.363
Yeah.

34:35.784 --> 34:36.705
And, and, uh,

34:37.107 --> 34:43.298
That's terrific.

34:43.338 --> 34:44.760
That's a good one.

34:44.961 --> 34:48.828
Yeah, so it would be worth looking at.

34:48.848 --> 34:53.235
And those will be in the library, and the O'Neill stuff should be in the library.

34:53.255 --> 34:56.621
I'm sorry, that's either in Sterling Library or Beinecke Library.

34:56.641 --> 34:57.543
Probably Beinecke.

34:57.723 --> 35:00.448
I just can't remember where they had it.

35:00.614 --> 35:01.175
That's great.

35:01.415 --> 35:13.934
They went through, and they've done it upright, so everything's in the acid-free things, and they got rid of the fluff and just what looked like the substance of letters between editors and authors and so on.

35:14.094 --> 35:18.580
So that's worth looking at.

35:22.446 --> 35:29.136
The other thing is, you or she can read the...

35:30.128 --> 35:46.663
All of the minutes of the Publications Committee and of the Governing Board are there in about six or eight bound volumes in John Donatich's office or outside it.

35:48.224 --> 35:57.773
So you probably could find whatever was said at the meeting where

35:58.073 --> 36:04.982
The Lonely Crowd was agreed to publish it, or Jesus Through the Centuries, or any other book that comes up.

36:05.403 --> 36:12.332
And how often does the publication committee meet?

36:12.352 --> 36:22.225
The publication committee meets monthly and considers a large agenda of books, every one of which has a

36:22.660 --> 36:24.763
whole series of documents connected to it.

36:24.823 --> 36:35.019
So an editor will say, I'm proposing to publish a book on Ben Johnson, and the editor writes a memorandum about it.

36:35.339 --> 36:43.872
There's at least one, sometimes several reviews by outside scholars attached to it, and then there's some discussion of publishing plans and so on.

36:44.373 --> 36:47.638
And for each and every one of those books, the

36:47.855 --> 36:50.799
The publication committee simply signs off on it.

36:50.819 --> 36:52.581
They say, we approve publication.

36:52.641 --> 36:58.489
So to key up a book with its, it's probably going to be several years before publication date.

36:58.509 --> 36:59.851
Yeah, yeah, almost always.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.475
But that should be relatively easy to find.

37:03.595 --> 37:16.292
And one of the interesting things you get is what the hopes and expectations of the press were, and the author, and how different it often turns out, of course.

37:16.880 --> 37:27.555
And from the other angle, it's a book that you don't have much hope for at all, and all of a sudden it just blows the air.

37:28.036 --> 37:29.879
Well, you know what the most famous of those is?

37:29.899 --> 37:30.319
No.

37:30.339 --> 37:45.621
Well, at least in my time, it was a book acquired about five or six years ago, and we bought it.

37:45.972 --> 38:01.688
American rights from an obscure London publisher that specializes in books on the Middle East, and it was called Oil Politics and Power in the Middle East, colon, the Taliban.

38:04.531 --> 38:15.102
And it was published in a hardcover edition, and it sold.

38:15.301 --> 38:16.142
quite nicely.

38:16.523 --> 38:19.186
I think like 4,000 copies, something like that.

38:20.328 --> 38:29.339
And the following summer, we brought out a paperback edition, and it began to sell at about the same rate, but that was good.

38:30.240 --> 38:43.738
And then after September 11th, there was not a single other book that people could turn to to find out

38:44.798 --> 38:45.979
who the Taliban were.

38:45.999 --> 38:49.624
And I remember when the book was first proposed and I said something like, what's a Taliban?

38:49.644 --> 38:54.530
I mean, I didn't, you know, the editors, well, no, it's this group, you need to know about them, so on.

38:54.750 --> 39:01.157
And I think in the next six weeks we sold something like 300,000, 400,000 copies.

39:01.177 --> 39:02.299
That's a great story.

39:02.319 --> 39:02.559
Yeah.

39:02.920 --> 39:10.569
And I mean, it's terrible that it had to be that, but it was the one reliable place that you could turn to for information.

39:10.589 --> 39:12.871
I mean, you remember when they were impeaching poor Clinton?

39:12.931 --> 39:13.472
Yeah, exactly.

39:13.874 --> 39:18.941
And all of a sudden, Rehnquist wrote a book twenty years or so earlier that they just remained everywhere.

39:18.961 --> 39:19.061
Yeah.

39:19.121 --> 39:21.864
Yeah, exactly.

39:22.265 --> 39:23.807
Exactly.

39:23.867 --> 39:25.149
Well, it did it.

39:25.169 --> 39:35.302
That book, I have it somewhere upstairs, it was number one on the New York Times paperback bestseller list for about ten weeks.

39:35.402 --> 39:36.663
I remember this.

39:36.763 --> 39:37.785
Yeah, yeah.

39:37.985 --> 39:43.392
And the guy who wrote it, Rashid, who's Pakistani, I think, yeah.

39:43.642 --> 39:50.971
I mean, next thing you know, he was on Peter Jennings.

39:50.991 --> 39:52.533
He's a great expert and so on.

39:52.573 --> 39:56.478
But it had its moment.

39:56.578 --> 39:59.561
So I felt that was really useful.

39:59.822 --> 40:03.246
And it was not a book published with any expectation like that at all.

40:03.306 --> 40:06.430
And the notes would show, all right, it's an important book.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.331
We'll publish it.

40:07.351 --> 40:10.855
Yeah, just because it tells a story that people don't know and so on.

40:10.895 --> 40:11.556
But that's all.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.245
Then, dammit, it did that.

40:17.386 --> 40:19.048
There must be a couple of other things.

40:19.068 --> 40:19.609
Oh, sure, a lot.

40:19.669 --> 40:22.873
And it's just a... You can think of them, you know, female me or whatever.

40:22.933 --> 40:23.534
Yeah.

40:23.554 --> 40:24.315
A very similar one.

40:24.415 --> 40:25.636
I know, just about two seconds.

40:26.537 --> 40:36.870
In about 1977, the press published an extremely esoteric book, which was a field guide to the Khmer language.

40:37.971 --> 40:40.294
And it was done on a typewriter.

40:40.662 --> 40:44.888
using a Khmer typewriter and an English language typewriter.

40:45.108 --> 40:47.312
And it was just English and Khmer.

40:47.332 --> 40:49.795
So you could, workers in the field could do it.

40:50.056 --> 40:53.661
And I think 500 copies were published.

40:54.161 --> 40:58.047
When the refugees started coming, it was the only book in existence.

40:58.685 --> 41:03.132
And I think sales peaked at about 35,000 copies.

41:03.532 --> 41:09.541
But again, it was blind luck, of course, but it was also wonderful utility.

41:09.581 --> 41:10.402
No, it's not.

41:10.503 --> 41:13.928
Somebody had the perception to say there's a utility.

41:13.968 --> 41:14.689
There is, yeah.

41:14.889 --> 41:23.202
But we would have and should have been perfectly satisfied that we sold all those 500 copies because that's all the field workers there were and so on.

41:23.222 --> 41:24.203
Isn't that great?

41:24.503 --> 41:30.071
I say being lucky is a very important part of being successful, whatever you do.

41:31.132 --> 41:34.937
Well, anyway, that's the idea.

41:34.957 --> 41:37.320
Well, I hope I've given you something to start with here.

41:38.542 --> 41:42.768
I'm going to go home now and listen to this and pull out some quotes.

41:42.808 --> 41:47.254
And then, as I get through this stuff, I think, you know, I'm around

41:47.588 --> 41:49.871
Do you mind an occasional phone call or something?

41:49.891 --> 41:50.411
Not at all.

41:50.552 --> 41:52.414
Or an email?

41:52.434 --> 41:53.175
Do you check your email?

41:53.255 --> 41:53.735
Absolutely.

41:53.876 --> 41:59.843
I'm so pleased you're doing this.

42:00.063 --> 42:01.224
I'm going to do a good job.

42:01.284 --> 42:01.845
I know you are.

42:01.865 --> 42:03.267
I admire your work.

42:04.989 --> 42:09.614
I have every intention to make this something that people will enjoy reading.

42:09.654 --> 42:13.239
And if I do nothing else, I'll bring my readers to it.

42:13.659 --> 42:16.903
I know that the people who are interested in my books will...

42:19.870 --> 42:27.621
When I retired, three different people gave me a copy of your Patients and Forces.

42:27.641 --> 42:28.202
No kidding.

42:28.222 --> 42:28.743
Yeah.

42:28.843 --> 42:30.345
Do you have my Gentle Madness?

42:30.506 --> 42:31.788
I do, and I've read it, yes.

42:31.848 --> 42:38.858
That's the one that my... I proposed to...
