WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:03.317
Okay, we're running now.

00:05.221 --> 00:09.971
So tell me a little bit about, I see you've got some curious George dolls in the house.

00:11.034 --> 00:11.575
Well, yes.

00:12.116 --> 00:23.119
They don't look very, not over there for the beauty, but they are some different periods, different, many different, you know, and they look all right to you, but they're not.

00:23.538 --> 00:27.545
Well, there are maybe one, two, three, four, five, or maybe ten or a dozen of them.

00:27.926 --> 00:29.929
So they represent, what, different times?

00:29.949 --> 00:35.860
Well, they are from different times, and that's what they're lying there for.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.847
I mean, you don't have to lie in there, but I don't know where to put them.

00:39.867 --> 00:40.748
No, but they're very nice.

00:40.828 --> 00:44.635
Well, it's certainly something nice for me to look at and to ask a question.

00:44.885 --> 00:46.727
Everywhere I look, I see George.

00:46.827 --> 00:47.969
I see George there.

00:48.289 --> 00:49.411
You sit, you sit.

00:49.531 --> 00:51.213
George there, George there.

00:51.273 --> 00:52.374
I saw him over there.

00:52.895 --> 00:54.797
He's quite a part of your life, isn't he?

00:55.098 --> 00:56.159
Oh, yes.

00:56.179 --> 00:59.103
At least he plays for Boy and Butter.

00:59.323 --> 01:01.806
And you say he's changed.

01:01.866 --> 01:03.548
How has he changed over the years?

01:03.929 --> 01:05.310
How did he change?

01:06.312 --> 01:14.622
I really don't remember it now, but there are at least three or four different production members, what do you call it?

01:15.040 --> 01:18.124
different people who produced it.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.386
The last one being Gunned.

01:20.328 --> 01:22.050
He is still doing it.

01:23.092 --> 01:25.996
Yes, some of those are from the older Russians.

01:26.016 --> 01:28.019
When you feel them, some are quite hard.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.723
It's hard to say what's different about them.

01:31.123 --> 01:32.425
For me, it's a big difference.

01:33.226 --> 01:37.853
But in terms of the character, did the character change much for you?

01:37.873 --> 01:40.497
I created it after all, the character.

01:41.118 --> 01:44.102
No, it's very hard to keep it

01:44.437 --> 01:46.099
Halfway the way I like it.

01:46.940 --> 01:55.091
The American dairy, most of them, just recently, even done to us, produced it for several years.

01:55.111 --> 01:57.694
God, they want to look so terrible.

01:57.714 --> 02:03.722
The eggs, too long, too thin, and the face bed, it's just not the same animal anymore, you know?

02:05.004 --> 02:09.229
But for yourself, could you tell me a little bit how you got the idea for George?

02:09.732 --> 02:12.636
Did you have any idea that it'd become what he did?

02:12.917 --> 02:14.699
No, you can't have an idea of that.

02:14.719 --> 02:16.202
You know, it comes.

02:17.043 --> 02:18.785
It comes, it comes.

02:18.805 --> 02:25.395
Also, at that time, what do you know, that's over 65 years ago, until we started.

02:25.675 --> 02:27.498
We started it in Paris.

02:28.419 --> 02:29.801
And it was quite by accident.

02:29.862 --> 02:36.972
My husband had done some cartoons for a French periodical newspaper.

02:37.930 --> 02:46.318
about the gilaf, the length of gilaf, you know, the giraffes use of the fire tower, or skiing, you know, nonsense.

02:46.338 --> 02:55.347
And Gallimari, a French publisher, called us up and said, couldn't we make a children's book out of it?

02:55.367 --> 02:56.348
They liked the scripture.

02:57.069 --> 02:58.811
Well, we had never thought of children's books.

02:59.251 --> 03:01.273
Well, we needed money, so we said yes.

03:01.894 --> 03:05.237
And the first book we did was, it was a

03:05.875 --> 03:15.506
Many years later, here, it was my brain.

03:15.526 --> 03:18.870
It's French, what I'm saying now.

03:18.990 --> 03:23.535
In English, it was called Cecily G and the Nine Monkeys.

03:23.655 --> 03:24.576
Sorry about that.

03:24.636 --> 03:24.997
Cecily?

03:25.017 --> 03:28.781
Cecily G. And the Nine Monkeys.

03:29.302 --> 03:32.786
So George had... Of the Nine Monkeys.

03:32.866 --> 03:34.988
So how come you decided to take one monkey

03:35.255 --> 03:35.936
Out of nine.

03:37.597 --> 03:38.538
I don't know.

03:38.558 --> 03:47.027
It was all... We get this first Curious George in France right after the Giraffe book.

03:47.047 --> 03:48.428
You know, we thought it sort of nice.

03:48.828 --> 03:49.829
We enjoyed it right away.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.893
My husband, Drew, and I wrote.

03:53.913 --> 03:55.435
It was closer to that, you know.

03:55.455 --> 03:56.396
It was not very close to that.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.657
It was a collaboration.

03:57.677 --> 03:57.977
Yes.

03:58.217 --> 03:59.519
Yes, it was a collaboration.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.882
Except it had its disadvantages.

04:03.183 --> 04:06.066
My husband was very slow and I was very fast.

04:06.086 --> 04:08.349
There's nothing you can do about it that people are that way.

04:08.909 --> 04:09.630
What came first?

04:09.650 --> 04:10.731
The pictures or the story?

04:10.911 --> 04:11.892
Or did the story come together?

04:11.912 --> 04:12.353
It came together.

04:13.534 --> 04:13.995
Sort of.

04:14.075 --> 04:22.344
I think we often we had a, what I call a right thread through the, through the story.

04:22.384 --> 04:26.168
You know that we wrote that first story.

04:27.109 --> 04:33.055
And then, I really can't tell you what came first and what didn't come first.

04:33.592 --> 04:36.736
The first book was a giraffe book?

04:36.756 --> 04:37.337
Sure.

04:37.357 --> 04:39.139
And was that successful?

04:39.159 --> 04:40.160
Yes, I think so.

04:40.220 --> 04:45.567
We wouldn't have dared it was successful, but not as enormously as George's, you know.

04:45.627 --> 04:50.293
So then from the giraffe book, where did the idea for the monkeys come from?

04:50.313 --> 04:55.940
Well, we just thought after the giraffe book, well, let's do another book.

04:55.961 --> 04:59.926
And we both liked monkeys especially, all elements, but monkeys especially.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.128
So we said, let's do a book about a monkey.

05:02.869 --> 05:03.430
And this

05:03.781 --> 05:10.190
We got it out of France on our bicycle street.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.512
We left France on bicycles.

05:12.274 --> 05:16.460
I don't know whether we have any material of us tonight.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.441
I don't.

05:17.461 --> 05:19.624
Do you have any here that I can take?

05:19.684 --> 05:21.247
I think so.

05:21.507 --> 05:23.730
That would be very helpful.

05:24.912 --> 05:26.234
When we're done, if you want.

05:26.495 --> 05:26.875
Okay.

05:28.297 --> 05:29.960
Gosh, those flowers, aren't they gorgeous?

05:30.260 --> 05:31.181
They're wonderful.

05:33.124 --> 05:33.585
Yes.

05:33.903 --> 05:35.565
to keep these things, yeah.

05:35.645 --> 05:37.527
I'm a co-writer.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.368
Have you got children?

05:38.748 --> 05:42.092
I have two daughters who love it, but I have 14 and 12.

05:42.172 --> 05:43.213
Oh, they're really too big, yeah?

05:43.373 --> 05:44.835
But they grew up with your stories.

05:45.275 --> 05:45.576
Yes.

05:45.816 --> 05:46.997
Barbara and Nicole.

05:50.521 --> 05:51.642
The girl's name is Barbara.

05:52.263 --> 05:54.685
Barbara, B-A-R-B-A-R-A.

06:00.432 --> 06:01.653
And her sister is Nicole.

06:02.454 --> 06:02.874
Nicole.

06:03.295 --> 06:03.555
Nicole.

06:03.957 --> 06:06.921
And I see... N-I-C-O-L-E.

06:07.722 --> 06:08.042
O-L-E.

06:08.282 --> 06:09.063
That's called it.

06:09.944 --> 06:13.669
Yes.

06:13.689 --> 06:13.909
Oh.

06:18.274 --> 06:19.416
What paper are you from?

06:20.076 --> 06:21.558
I have a syndicate.

06:21.578 --> 06:23.360
I write for about 25 newspapers.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.101
It's better, yeah?

06:24.161 --> 06:24.862
Makes more money.

06:25.343 --> 06:30.729
Well, it makes it... I have a Quincy... Give me that orange thing there, please.

06:30.749 --> 06:31.010
This?

06:31.130 --> 06:31.450
No.

06:31.570 --> 06:31.791
This.

06:31.811 --> 06:32.091
Yeah.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.297
What did you say, Quincy?

06:36.738 --> 06:49.936
Quincy, Worcester, New London, Connecticut, Salt Lake City, Utah, Charlottesville, Virginia, Eugene, Oregon, Columbus, Ohio, Austin, Texas, about 25 newspapers.

06:50.057 --> 06:50.798
Very nice.

06:50.818 --> 06:54.984
A couple down in New Jersey, Asbury Park, largely university towns.

06:55.785 --> 06:56.446
Yes.

06:56.466 --> 07:00.632
So we'll get a lot of stories out of this.

07:00.652 --> 07:00.852
Yes, yes.

07:00.872 --> 07:01.453
Oh, that's nice.

07:01.533 --> 07:02.775
Thank you.

07:02.795 --> 07:04.457
So we're talking about

07:04.724 --> 07:10.071
The idea for the monkeys, it just kind of... Yeah, I mean, it came the way I just told you.

07:10.091 --> 07:11.954
It wasn't George, it wasn't anything.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.057
It was just a book about a monkey.

07:15.158 --> 07:22.088
And then when we came here, which was several years later, I think.

07:22.688 --> 07:23.510
Some years later.

07:24.371 --> 07:32.542
And... Yeah, we had... Hi, sweetie.

07:32.562 --> 07:32.622
Hi.

07:34.694 --> 07:36.816
Are you leaving?

07:37.637 --> 07:37.917
Huh?

07:38.437 --> 07:38.818
Here.

07:38.998 --> 07:39.118
Hello.

07:39.138 --> 07:40.119
How are you?

07:40.139 --> 07:40.880
Thank you, dear.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.041
Lely.

07:42.061 --> 07:42.761
Oh.

07:43.482 --> 07:45.904
I still can't pronounce his name.

07:46.224 --> 07:47.145
Me?

07:47.185 --> 07:49.127
Baz Baines.

07:49.367 --> 07:52.110
I'll leave you my card.

07:52.810 --> 07:53.731
What is that for a name?

07:53.751 --> 07:54.192
It's Greek.

07:54.732 --> 07:56.354
Greek name.

07:56.534 --> 07:56.834
Greek?

07:57.235 --> 08:00.237
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:00.257 --> 08:00.497
Greek.

08:02.359 --> 08:03.300
Yes, and then?

08:05.255 --> 08:07.278
You know, we left France on bicycles.

08:08.680 --> 08:12.766
We had no car, and we had to wait long for the papers.

08:13.347 --> 08:17.874
As you know, all your paper can travel, not the person, you know.

08:18.675 --> 08:22.261
And... Pussy, how are you feeling?

08:22.782 --> 08:23.242
Better, sir.

08:23.963 --> 08:24.224
Huh?

08:26.127 --> 08:28.130
I'm sorry, I didn't... Oh, thank you, thank you.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.974
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

08:30.994 --> 08:32.656
Ah, is that the French ones, is it?

08:32.737 --> 08:33.017
No.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.706
One of the monkeys is Curious George.

08:35.726 --> 08:37.589
Yes, I told her that already.

08:38.209 --> 08:40.092
And there's the giraffe right there, too.

08:40.112 --> 08:41.754
Yes, yes.

08:41.774 --> 08:42.255
Cecily.

08:42.715 --> 08:43.236
Well, that's one.

08:44.097 --> 08:45.439
Curious George was clever.

08:45.699 --> 08:49.304
So how come you decided people liked Curious George?

08:49.684 --> 08:53.169
I guess there's something about the curiosity of an animal.

08:53.249 --> 08:54.491
Why they like it so well?

08:54.711 --> 08:55.011
Yeah.

08:56.393 --> 08:59.096
Did people, did you hear from the readers that they liked this one?

08:59.137 --> 09:00.999
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

09:01.019 --> 09:01.840
She knows now.

09:02.714 --> 09:05.077
I think it's 55 years now.

09:05.097 --> 09:05.397
55?

09:05.417 --> 09:06.279
It's a very long time.

09:06.699 --> 09:07.901
Sure, that's great.

09:07.921 --> 09:10.244
And that's a lot of generations of children, too.

09:10.264 --> 09:11.485
Absolutely, yes.

09:11.505 --> 09:13.628
Children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

09:13.648 --> 09:14.269
That's right.

09:14.589 --> 09:21.158
And that's the mark of a classic, you know, the fact that if it goes into multiple generations, that makes it a classic.

09:21.218 --> 09:22.439
It is a classic now, yeah.

09:22.459 --> 09:27.466
Well, what is it that resonates, do you think, from generation to generation?

09:27.686 --> 09:28.087
I don't know.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.869
I think, I really don't know.

09:31.165 --> 09:35.270
I only know that it was an immense effort for us to write them.

09:35.611 --> 09:41.037
People always think, you know, of librarians, they say, oh, they must have had fun dashing them off.

09:41.318 --> 09:44.041
You know, there was no effort behind it.

09:44.421 --> 09:47.585
It took us an enormous time to do each book.

09:47.605 --> 09:50.068
And after each book, we said, none anymore.

09:50.088 --> 09:50.809
Too much trouble.

09:51.270 --> 09:55.115
And then we waited five, six years, like mothers having children.

09:55.475 --> 09:58.859
After a while, they had forgotten their paintings.

09:58.879 --> 09:59.400
And...

10:01.102 --> 10:04.166
Then we did another one, but we didn't space them out.

10:04.766 --> 10:08.932
Well, what made it so difficult when people say... I don't know.

10:09.012 --> 10:11.214
The story has to... I don't know.

10:11.234 --> 10:12.215
It's hard to explain.

10:12.596 --> 10:18.143
The story has to flow, and after it went this way, that my husband had ideas.

10:18.283 --> 10:24.611
He had just his idea for, I want a monkey with a dinosaur in a museum, you know?

10:24.631 --> 10:26.653
And I want a monkey...

10:29.148 --> 10:30.630
Various places.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.713
They were often not connected at all.

10:34.334 --> 10:48.450
So my job was, more like a mother musk, you know, or whatever you want to call it, to get that story, those pictures, looking, there was a natural connection there.

10:49.571 --> 10:52.714
And it wasn't all that way, but often.

10:52.734 --> 10:55.037
And I don't know whether one husband there was, for instance,

10:55.473 --> 10:57.076
I don't know whether you know the books at all.

10:57.416 --> 10:57.717
I do.

10:57.797 --> 10:58.518
I have them.

10:58.538 --> 10:59.359
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:59.379 --> 10:59.980
You've read them all.

11:00.040 --> 11:00.481
I've read them.

11:00.521 --> 11:01.503
My children love them.

11:01.583 --> 11:01.863
Yes.

11:02.144 --> 11:09.796
Well, you know the one where George, George, put soap powder on the spurs and all.

11:09.816 --> 11:10.958
Yes, yes, yes.

11:10.978 --> 11:13.101
You know, now that idea came, for instance.

11:13.121 --> 11:18.370
I finally remember that my husband, as a boy, he said, his mother said something wrong.

11:18.390 --> 11:22.016
So we had other boys there and said, you clean the kitchen while I'm going.

11:22.076 --> 11:22.797
Go on to the left.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.083
And so, at that point, he did something similar.

11:26.543 --> 11:31.048
And anyhow, that guy, they used soap powder and made a mess.

11:31.068 --> 11:33.611
Not that big a mess, as he made, but a mess.

11:34.231 --> 11:35.313
I don't know what it is.

11:35.953 --> 11:36.434
I don't know.

11:36.694 --> 11:42.520
Now, when you started, when you did the giraffes, were you working as a team then, a husband-wife team?

11:42.760 --> 11:43.281
Oh, yes.

11:43.301 --> 11:46.464
So you always planned to work together as an artist and a writer.

11:46.484 --> 11:47.525
We didn't plan it.

11:47.545 --> 11:48.747
It happened that way.

11:48.987 --> 11:49.948
We never planned.

11:51.127 --> 11:51.968
In a way, you know?

11:52.208 --> 11:54.270
Yes, we did that before.

11:54.290 --> 12:01.096
We lived in Rio de Janeiro before, and we worked together there already.

12:01.116 --> 12:02.257
But we did other things.

12:03.177 --> 12:04.839
My husband wrote news for the 80s.

12:05.079 --> 12:06.580
He'd lived there for 10 years.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.982
And he knew everybody.

12:09.143 --> 12:13.947
And everybody loved him because he was such a cheerful fellow.

12:14.868 --> 12:18.611
And so was I. You're fine.

12:18.731 --> 12:21.133
You lived in Rio, and you went to France.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.605
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:24.446 --> 12:26.228
From Rio, we went back to Europe.

12:27.409 --> 12:31.614
My parents invited us to a related honeymoon.

12:32.575 --> 12:34.257
But everybody left Europe, you know.

12:35.018 --> 12:36.119
We went back to Europe.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.685
And we stayed there a while.

12:41.345 --> 12:44.108
We stayed four or five years with parents.

12:44.709 --> 12:45.770
We never wanted to leave you.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.172
Have you ever been to parents?

12:47.708 --> 12:48.048
Yes.

12:48.209 --> 12:49.050
Isn't it wonderful?

12:49.931 --> 12:50.912
It's like it's not real.

12:50.972 --> 12:51.973
It's so beautiful.

12:51.993 --> 12:53.174
Yes, yes, yes.

12:53.194 --> 12:55.036
It's a very magical city.

12:55.076 --> 12:55.977
So why did you leave?

12:56.918 --> 12:59.281
Because the Germans were right on our feet.

12:59.301 --> 12:59.902
The evasion.

13:00.803 --> 13:02.665
That's where we lived.

13:02.685 --> 13:05.028
And we had nothing to go.

13:06.349 --> 13:14.138
So my husband went in one of those large stores.

13:15.873 --> 13:20.117
The homeowner's end, they called them before.

13:20.177 --> 13:21.218
Department store?

13:21.398 --> 13:22.960
Yes, department store.

13:22.980 --> 13:28.745
And there were no bicycles left, but he found somewhere parts for bicycles.

13:29.206 --> 13:32.709
So he made them move.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.612
We didn't know he worked on them until we had them out.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.574
My great surprise, I didn't know he was so efficient.

13:38.755 --> 13:39.936
And then we started.

13:40.116 --> 13:42.859
And we ran out south, south, like everybody else.

13:44.341 --> 13:47.807
And then in the middle of France, we found a tray.

13:48.167 --> 13:50.992
Yeah, I meant to say, at the back, you know what a bicycle looks like?

13:51.412 --> 13:54.437
It has a little thing, and the back is all we could take.

13:55.038 --> 13:55.379
Really?

13:55.439 --> 13:58.283
So we'd take all the books we'd had.

13:58.364 --> 14:05.515
There wasn't too many, but we had books made, which proved to be a very sensible thing to do, you know, to take the books.

14:05.535 --> 14:06.096
Why is that?

14:06.457 --> 14:10.483
Because they knew here what we were doing.

14:10.902 --> 14:12.284
You know, we had to sell all of this.

14:12.304 --> 14:15.229
Oh, so you could show... Of course, yeah, that makes sense.

14:15.249 --> 14:15.890
It didn't really, yeah.

14:16.370 --> 14:17.552
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

14:17.953 --> 14:18.233
Yeah.

14:18.554 --> 14:22.219
So did it take a long time to pick up over here when you came here, or...?

14:22.239 --> 14:32.555
Well, I tell you, we had already in Rio made, you know, investigated, wrote down all the publishers we had.

14:32.936 --> 14:38.724
We had to start from scratch, and had a long list and so on.

14:38.744 --> 14:39.846
And when we came here,

14:40.940 --> 14:42.602
I came by boat at that time.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.705
You know, I came by boat.

14:45.526 --> 14:48.050
And my sister was on the chaise.

14:49.111 --> 14:52.596
And she said, there's a bad letter from you, from Horton Mifflin.

14:52.996 --> 14:55.399
Now, Horton Mifflin, there's always funny coincidences.

14:55.860 --> 15:02.008
Horton Mifflin's juvenile editor had brought her children over here.

15:02.028 --> 15:05.413
There's so many French women lived during this war.

15:05.493 --> 15:08.517
She had her children here with her grandmother.

15:09.391 --> 15:15.902
And she wrote as a letter, Grace Hogarth, I remember her name, and said, don't see anybody.

15:15.922 --> 15:18.887
I'll come right down and sign you up.

15:18.907 --> 15:20.149
And that's happened that way.

15:20.549 --> 15:24.035
And actually, it was quite a disappointment for us.

15:24.055 --> 15:26.659
We had a feeling we had to work our way up, you know.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.703
But it also was nice.

15:28.843 --> 15:32.529
But it was, well, as I said, we felt disappointed.

15:33.491 --> 15:34.993
We wanted to start all over.

15:35.260 --> 15:38.363
Do you find the children all over the world like the same things?

15:38.464 --> 15:40.246
Absolutely.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.488
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

15:42.508 --> 15:49.876
So you had no trouble taking the concept and moving it here and having it... No, no, no.

15:49.896 --> 15:52.640
The text, nothing changed in the text.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.462
In the picture, something changed.

15:54.482 --> 15:58.306
Now, if you look at the first one carefully, there are French things on it.

15:58.326 --> 16:00.649
The tabac, you know, the sign.

16:01.009 --> 16:02.871
Signs in the street, one can see it.

16:03.374 --> 16:08.080
There's the flicks, what do they call them, the policemen, you know, with their little kids.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.683
There's things there which you cannot imagine.

16:10.083 --> 16:15.310
And here, too, in one book, it looks like Fifth Avenue.

16:15.330 --> 16:16.832
Remember that thing?

16:17.814 --> 16:22.520
And only in that sense, anything was changed.

16:23.481 --> 16:28.268
But the story, kids seem to laugh at the same things.

16:28.788 --> 16:34.334
children seem to laugh, be amused by, have wonder for the same things all over the world, don't they?

16:34.354 --> 16:34.694
Yes, it is.

16:34.714 --> 16:39.259
We have never, we had never any complaints.

16:39.279 --> 16:39.920
Yes, we had.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.244
There is one book, you know, there is another book, Pretzel, you don't know Pretzel.

16:44.264 --> 16:44.905
I don't know.

16:44.985 --> 16:46.046
It's a book I wrote, yeah.

16:46.587 --> 16:56.517
It's a book about the long dachshund, and at one point, the dachshund, the dachshund, he gets married to Pretzel, and they go

16:56.952 --> 16:59.134
And they get married.

16:59.654 --> 17:03.137
And they walk and they don't want to see a session towards a church.

17:03.738 --> 17:05.279
And that was the stuff.

17:05.299 --> 17:09.783
Some people wrote as animals cannot be married in a church.

17:10.724 --> 17:11.985
There's things like that, you know?

17:12.806 --> 17:13.306
It's amusing.

17:13.807 --> 17:14.767
You never know.

17:14.787 --> 17:18.050
I mean, there's always somebody out there to pick on things, I think.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.331
Yes, yes, yes.

17:19.491 --> 17:20.452
Not much.

17:20.492 --> 17:21.433
We don't pick much.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.335
Yeah, I really don't know.

17:23.415 --> 17:25.997
Everybody asks me, of course, why this is so stressful.

17:26.956 --> 17:27.997
I don't know.

17:28.017 --> 17:29.779
You have to do guesses at all and what.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.844
But it certainly changed your life, didn't it?

17:34.165 --> 17:35.106
Oh, yes.

17:35.326 --> 17:36.547
Oh, yes, of course.

17:36.567 --> 17:38.229
You know, it's a profession to have.

17:38.630 --> 17:40.312
You get royalties.

17:40.512 --> 17:41.493
You get what?

17:41.513 --> 17:42.154
Royalties.

17:42.174 --> 17:43.416
Oh, royalties, yeah.

17:43.436 --> 17:45.378
No other profession does royalties, no?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.741
Years after the fact, too.

17:47.761 --> 17:49.202
Constantly, yeah, yeah.

17:49.222 --> 17:52.546
And the books are better doing just as good today as they were 20 years ago.

17:52.566 --> 17:53.147
Yes, yes.

17:53.167 --> 17:54.148
It's amazing, yeah.

17:55.129 --> 17:55.630
It's amazing.

17:56.588 --> 18:05.738
And what do you think your husband would have liked to do with his art if he hadn't have done children's books?

18:06.199 --> 18:07.821
Oh, he would have been a scientist.

18:07.861 --> 18:15.289
He wrote two books about the stars and astronomy, and he was really a scientist.

18:15.870 --> 18:20.235
He was just, he could do anything, you know, but it wouldn't have been any difficulty for him.

18:20.696 --> 18:22.177
It would have been more difficult for me.

18:22.838 --> 18:24.520
But you said it was very hard.

18:24.989 --> 18:27.272
You say this work was very, very hard.

18:27.853 --> 18:29.094
Very hard.

18:29.114 --> 18:30.156
To do it as well.

18:30.556 --> 18:35.263
I mean, it may be that part of the reason that we are so well liked.

18:35.943 --> 18:40.249
That we took infinite trouble with the story and with the drawing.

18:40.309 --> 18:42.913
And that may not sound like much to you, but it is.

18:43.053 --> 18:43.794
Well, I'm a writer.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.296
I've written my own book.

18:45.536 --> 18:46.017
You know that?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.639
I know exactly what you're saying.

18:47.659 --> 18:47.919
Oh, yeah.

18:47.939 --> 18:48.720
You know what you're saying.

18:48.740 --> 18:50.182
The trick is to make it look easy.

18:50.342 --> 18:51.484
Yes, absolutely.

18:51.504 --> 18:51.604
Yeah.

18:52.428 --> 18:53.510
Absolutely.

18:53.890 --> 18:56.133
But believe me, I know what you're saying.

18:56.734 --> 18:57.556
Nothing is easy.

18:57.716 --> 18:58.757
Nothing good is easy.

18:58.878 --> 18:59.819
Nothing good is easy.

19:00.159 --> 19:06.969
But all has to look easy.

19:06.989 --> 19:12.017
I'm not going to take up too much of your time, because I have the books, and I did want to come by and get a couple of quotations.

19:12.157 --> 19:12.297
Sure.

19:12.317 --> 19:12.798
What do you do?

19:13.259 --> 19:14.701
I live out in the Worcester area.

19:14.981 --> 19:15.482
Oh, here.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.223
It's Massachusetts.

19:16.243 --> 19:16.524
Yeah.

19:17.485 --> 19:18.506
And what's the doggie's name?

19:19.087 --> 19:19.628
Jeannie.

19:19.648 --> 19:20.049
Jeannie.

19:20.489 --> 19:21.591
And how old is Jeannie?

19:21.807 --> 19:23.349
She is quite young.

19:23.369 --> 19:28.756
How come she has a little diaper one?

19:28.776 --> 19:33.902
See, we haven't yet managed to... I've never seen such a diaper.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.526
The only dog in a diaper.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.108
Not many dogs wear diapers.

19:38.188 --> 19:38.929
Yeah, that is funny.

19:39.289 --> 19:40.591
What kind of dog is she?

19:40.911 --> 19:42.754
Oh, she's very, very nice.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.275
I've got a big Labrador Retriever.

19:44.336 --> 19:44.876
Oh, yeah.

19:45.817 --> 19:47.399
Big, yeah.

19:47.440 --> 19:47.780
Black?

19:47.960 --> 19:48.661
Black, yeah.

19:49.182 --> 19:49.823
Nice dog.

19:50.023 --> 19:50.904
Very nice.

19:50.924 --> 19:51.004
Yes.

19:51.878 --> 19:53.821
What else was I going to ask you?

19:54.763 --> 20:01.313
Margaret, you always told me why your books are so much loved by children.

20:01.333 --> 20:09.466
It's because it has a lot of things that children would love to do, like getting into trouble and all that, but they can't do it in real life.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.549
They do it through your book.

20:11.569 --> 20:15.175
Yeah, like painting a room and all those things.

20:16.497 --> 20:17.459
She's sweet.

20:17.479 --> 20:18.240
She's sweet, yeah?

20:18.642 --> 20:23.087
And George gets into trouble, but he gets out of it through his own ingenuity.

20:23.147 --> 20:26.111
Yes, yes, this is part of George.

20:26.211 --> 20:27.993
You want to get rid of him?

20:28.013 --> 20:29.014
Let's throw him down.

20:29.094 --> 20:32.378
Okay, I'll go with him.

20:32.398 --> 20:39.547
So when you were creating the stories, was that in mind, that you would have George do the kinds of things, the kids?

20:39.887 --> 20:41.469
No, he had nothing in mind.

20:42.010 --> 20:46.455
Everybody asks me these questions, and they get on a long track.

20:47.347 --> 20:52.152
We wrote the stories only the way we liked it.

20:52.853 --> 20:55.075
It was our only limit.

20:56.177 --> 20:59.020
And by a happy coincidence, the children loved it later.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.281
It was exactly right.

21:00.301 --> 21:06.208
We never let people do now, you know, asks in schools and, you know, research and all that stuff.

21:06.268 --> 21:06.989
It's all baloney.

21:07.789 --> 21:09.591
You know, if you're gifted enough, you don't need it.

21:09.932 --> 21:10.272
That's right.

21:10.332 --> 21:13.396
Now, if it makes you laugh, it'll make the kids laugh, right?

21:13.416 --> 21:13.556
Yeah.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.598
And, of course, you never wrote, did you write,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.183
Did you feel that you were writing down to the children?

21:18.263 --> 21:19.124
No, no.

21:19.684 --> 21:20.385
No, of course not.

21:21.186 --> 21:22.407
Not at all.

21:22.427 --> 21:28.314
But as I say, we hardly ever thought of children as when we wrote them.

21:28.334 --> 21:29.435
It was we just wrote them.

21:30.477 --> 21:35.823
And I never look at other children's books, and people always think it's funny, but what children have I?

21:35.843 --> 21:37.385
I wouldn't have it in any way.

21:38.065 --> 21:38.506
Never do.

21:40.288 --> 21:42.530
I'm trying to write a children's book now myself.

21:42.811 --> 21:43.071
Oh.

21:43.253 --> 21:45.696
Yeah, my book just went into its fifth printing.

21:45.716 --> 21:48.680
I have a book about bibliomania, about bubble madness.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.763
In fact, I'm signing at Borders tonight.

21:50.903 --> 21:53.326
I'm going over to Borders to do a signing.

21:53.907 --> 21:54.968
Borders?

21:55.008 --> 21:56.530
It's a bookstore in Boston.

21:56.551 --> 21:59.534
It's called Borders, B-O-R-D-E-R-S.

21:59.554 --> 21:59.895
B-O-R-D-E-R-S?

22:00.095 --> 22:00.796
Yeah, it's a chain.

22:00.836 --> 22:02.018
It's a chain of bookstores.

22:02.038 --> 22:03.079
Borders bookstore?

22:03.099 --> 22:05.282
Yeah, I'm signing there my book tonight.

22:05.302 --> 22:06.323
What's your book called?

22:06.524 --> 22:10.008
It's called A Gentle Madness, and it's about bibliomania.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.370
It's about the madness of books.

22:11.637 --> 22:15.802
And I'm just right now proposing to do a children's book on this subject.

22:15.822 --> 22:16.943
Who's your publisher?

22:16.963 --> 22:17.644
I'm with Holtz.

22:18.285 --> 22:18.865
Henry Holtz?

22:19.086 --> 22:20.247
Oh, Henry Holtz, yeah.

22:20.267 --> 22:21.048
They're here, aren't they?

22:21.308 --> 22:22.450
No, they're in New York.

22:22.830 --> 22:24.892
They used to be in Boston, yeah.

22:25.213 --> 22:30.439
No, Holtz has always been in New York, but... They had a small office in Boston.

22:30.459 --> 22:30.899
Holtz, H-L-Z.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.002
I know, a dad was in here.

22:33.663 --> 22:34.303
Yeah.

22:34.323 --> 22:35.805
But the children's book, I'm...

22:36.005 --> 22:38.408
proposing to Mrs. Houghton Mifflin, actually.

22:38.428 --> 22:39.490
Oh, that's ours.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.252
And they like it very much, the idea.

22:41.452 --> 22:46.379
It'll be about libraries through history, like Alex.

22:48.722 --> 22:52.987
I'm just, I'm going with, I just wrote a letter to Anita Sylvie, the boss.

22:53.168 --> 22:55.270
And we're just talking now.

22:55.511 --> 22:59.015
There's no, but they like the idea and we're developing it.

23:00.237 --> 23:01.759
And my own publisher, Holt,

23:02.043 --> 23:06.729
I think it's good to have a different publisher for your adult books and your children books work with different people.

23:07.550 --> 23:11.555
And this is closer to home for me, because if they get an artist, then I can work with an artist.

23:11.575 --> 23:12.977
Is it a historical look?

23:13.057 --> 23:23.170
Yeah, but it will be libraries like at Alexandria in Egypt through history, how books have been preserved and saved and how people have been, you know, interested in saving things.

23:23.310 --> 23:27.555
It's kind of, I haven't got a title for it yet, but I'm just working.

23:27.575 --> 23:29.097
We don't have to talk about this certainly.

23:29.903 --> 23:32.266
But really, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

23:32.346 --> 23:35.249
I know I've got plenty of material.

23:35.269 --> 23:36.750
Do you think we've hit the high points?

23:36.770 --> 23:40.715
I think really the books speak for themselves, certainly.

23:40.855 --> 23:46.121
And I know that there's a lot of material in this that will help me.

23:46.601 --> 23:49.184
So really, I've got a half an hour, which is really very good.

23:49.865 --> 23:52.547
And they told me, can I take this?

23:52.567 --> 23:54.289
No, I don't think you have enough.

23:54.510 --> 23:55.651
You have several of them.

23:55.671 --> 23:55.831
Okay.

23:56.552 --> 23:56.652
Okay.

23:56.672 --> 23:56.772
Good.

23:56.971 --> 23:59.013
In fact, you want to sign it to me?

23:59.033 --> 24:00.872
Yeah, that would be nice if you'd sign this to me.
