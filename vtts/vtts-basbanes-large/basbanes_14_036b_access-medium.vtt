WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:06.855
Whether it's in this building or not, that's what has to be dealt with.

00:06.875 --> 00:13.024
You know, maybe, well, if you really wanted a true Schaumburg... It had to have its own... Maybe it would be off-site.

00:13.385 --> 00:13.705
Yeah.

00:13.865 --> 00:15.788
You know, because Schaumburg's in Harlem.

00:15.808 --> 00:16.089
I know.

00:16.729 --> 00:18.492
Where its use is.

00:18.512 --> 00:27.646
And that's... Yeah, but as you say, I mean, ambiance in that... I don't know where an appropriate place in San Francisco would be.

00:28.387 --> 00:32.012
Not the places such as... But it wouldn't necessarily have to be in this.

00:32.161 --> 00:34.344
No, it doesn't have to be, it wouldn't have to be here.

00:35.064 --> 00:45.056
We haven't even, we have to get through what we've got before we can determine, in terms of the gay collections, we have to get through what we've got before we can determine.

00:45.757 --> 00:59.333
Yeah, I mentioned to, he didn't know about it, to Steve Fulton, but you should, if you want to pursue this, Cornell has a remarkable collection that is essentially gay, lesbian, they call it the human sexuality collection.

00:59.482 --> 01:06.694
It was largely donated by an exceedingly wealthy man, as his name escapes me right now, who's a Cornell alumnus.

01:08.296 --> 01:16.570
And he gave the collection and, of course, a very generous endowment to not only to add to it, but to maintain it.

01:17.171 --> 01:17.952
And that's another thing.

01:17.972 --> 01:18.914
You need a curator.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.017
You need somebody in charge.

01:22.060 --> 01:22.761
That's right.

01:22.862 --> 01:24.765
To go out and acquire, you need all this stuff.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.148
I mean, it's not just the room and the books.

01:26.168 --> 01:30.075
It's not just the room and the books and the cataloging, it's all the other stuff.

01:30.095 --> 01:32.440
There is a people factor involved.

01:32.460 --> 01:32.660
Yeah.

01:32.680 --> 01:44.743
Yeah, but the Cornell thing, and I'll remember, I've got all the material on at home if you'd like, it's really something that's worth, and it's you can... Yeah, you know, I'll...

01:45.027 --> 01:47.149
Is it called the Human Sexuality Collection?

01:47.169 --> 01:49.011
I believe, yeah, but it's named after the film.

01:49.031 --> 01:50.112
But it's the Human Sexuality.

01:50.132 --> 01:52.335
You know Mark Dimunation at Cornell?

01:52.595 --> 01:54.457
He's the head of special collections.

01:54.477 --> 01:54.697
No.

01:54.717 --> 01:56.059
He's a very, very nice man.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.106
And he'd tell you in 22 seconds all about it and send you some information on it.

02:03.807 --> 02:03.907
Okay.

02:03.927 --> 02:07.932
But it's the kind of thing that you really, you know, if you're looking for it.

02:07.992 --> 02:08.412
I don't know.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.494
I mean, but it is primary stuff, too.

02:11.035 --> 02:13.077
A lot of 50s stuff, a lot of...

02:13.715 --> 02:17.499
pulp stuff, a little ephemeral stuff.

02:17.619 --> 02:22.183
We've got quite a bit of that, too, but no real exhaustive stuff.

02:22.203 --> 02:27.729
You know, it's what people have given us, what people have found, what they had in their own libraries.

02:28.309 --> 02:28.830
But that's great stuff.

02:29.050 --> 02:31.172
It is, but it's not exhaustive.

02:31.192 --> 02:36.197
Jim Hormel has given us a lot of money for the gay and lesbian collections.

02:36.217 --> 02:40.701
I was thinking in the back of my head when you said, you know, you need an angel for this.

02:41.221 --> 02:42.342
He's been there.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.724
He's probably the angel.

02:43.744 --> 02:46.907
He's been the largest angel we have on that collection, yes.

02:47.608 --> 02:55.055
You know, Nick, if you want to contact Jim by email, you have my email on the card.

02:55.636 --> 03:02.663
And just instead of my name, just put Jim V. Jim V. At SFPL.

03:03.364 --> 03:04.084
Okay, good.

03:04.164 --> 03:05.726
And I have my computer with me.

03:05.866 --> 03:07.588
Yeah, .ca.us.

03:07.868 --> 03:09.149
No, SFPL.

03:09.830 --> 03:10.671
It's on this thing.

03:11.039 --> 03:12.140
Take another one if you want.

03:12.481 --> 03:14.643
I get millions of these.

03:16.725 --> 03:18.267
Yes, I'm going to call.

03:18.287 --> 03:19.749
Do you mind if I shoot a picture of you?

03:19.949 --> 03:20.690
No, not at all.

03:22.111 --> 03:25.896
I'm a jack of all, a nick of all trades.

03:26.857 --> 03:28.759
Most of the pictures in that book are short.

03:32.203 --> 03:34.846
I'm so excited about this new book.

03:34.866 --> 03:35.967
It's going to be fun, man.

03:37.398 --> 03:42.386
City Hall right behind me, all under construction?

03:42.406 --> 03:43.248
Yeah, that's nice.

03:44.109 --> 03:47.675
I trick it to make sure I don't get too much— Too much glare, yeah.

03:47.695 --> 03:48.236
Too much glare.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.259
So I'm going to do one available light like that.

03:51.742 --> 03:53.645
I think you should do a flash.

03:53.665 --> 03:58.774
And I'm going to do the flash, but I'm really getting the reading a few of the silly shadows.

04:01.779 --> 04:02.680
Okay.

04:02.795 --> 04:07.022
Susan Goldstein is going to show you.

04:07.283 --> 04:11.389
And then you don't mind if I kind of wander around and talk to people?

04:12.030 --> 04:12.872
No, I don't mind.

04:13.894 --> 04:20.725
We do have to have you escorted when you're down in Brooks Hall, though.

04:22.368 --> 04:27.857
I was going to take you down myself, but I don't have time this morning.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.147
Yeah.

04:38.812 --> 04:52.760
Oh, those old ones where you do it yourself.

04:52.881 --> 04:54.604
Yeah, but where you do the explosions.

05:00.659 --> 05:03.503
You said you're a book person, you love books.

05:04.324 --> 05:06.948
You said, take a look at the Berkeley Library.

05:07.128 --> 05:08.470
What did you say?

05:08.490 --> 05:13.357
Oh, that's the way I have defined that poor old place.

05:13.818 --> 05:16.602
She's a 65-year-old woman who's dressed as too tight.

05:17.563 --> 05:19.546
That's the way I've always described it.

05:19.907 --> 05:22.971
Books coming out of your ears, books coming out of your eyes.

05:23.792 --> 05:24.333
It's everywhere.

05:24.393 --> 05:25.675
My house is filled with them.

05:25.755 --> 05:27.738
I probably have 4,000 books at home.

05:28.078 --> 05:28.399
Really?

05:28.659 --> 05:29.561
Yep.

05:29.581 --> 05:30.582
Are you a collector?

05:30.848 --> 05:31.990
No, I'm a reader.

05:32.010 --> 05:42.123
I use the library a lot, and I always have three or four books I'm reading at a time, because if I get tired of one, I switch to another one.

05:43.264 --> 05:46.529
But sometimes I decide I have to own it.

05:48.972 --> 05:56.081
There's one that came out that I had to own that was like a history of inventions, and I just loved it.

05:56.141 --> 05:57.463
It was a cultural history.

05:57.629 --> 05:58.832
I can't remember the title.

05:58.972 --> 06:00.536
I used to remember authors and titles.

06:00.636 --> 06:02.601
Now my brain's not holding it.

06:02.621 --> 06:04.726
It was published about three or four years ago.

06:04.746 --> 06:06.952
And this is like a reference book.

06:06.972 --> 06:07.633
I think I know the book.

06:07.653 --> 06:09.378
I sat and read this damn book.

06:09.859 --> 06:10.701
Is this by Petrosky?

06:10.861 --> 06:11.824
Yes, I think so.

06:12.064 --> 06:14.490
He also did the book of a pencil, which I thought was.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.164
The history of the pencil.

06:16.204 --> 06:17.085
Think about that.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.410
Well, I get intrigued by David McCauley's things, too.

06:20.570 --> 06:21.711
I just interviewed him last week.

06:21.831 --> 06:23.173
He's fascinating.

06:23.213 --> 06:24.515
My wife and I went to see him.

06:24.755 --> 06:30.163
I write a weekly book column that I've syndicated in about 25 or so newspapers.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.925
Did you read Motel of the Mysteries?

06:32.145 --> 06:32.726
I loved that.

06:33.107 --> 06:34.609
I think it was wonderful.

06:34.709 --> 06:36.631
Well, did you read A Canticle from Leibowitz?

06:36.651 --> 06:37.372
Yes, I did.

06:37.432 --> 06:40.056
Well, that's kind of, you know, this...

06:40.424 --> 06:42.786
You know, the sacred text is bring home the soul.

06:43.007 --> 06:46.410
Exactly, exactly.

06:46.430 --> 06:47.471
So I read everything.

06:47.511 --> 06:51.475
I don't read much science fiction, but I do read some.

06:52.175 --> 06:53.657
I love historical fiction.

06:55.018 --> 07:02.025
I don't like murder mysteries, but I'll read them because if I want something fast.

07:02.045 --> 07:09.132
I'll even read such non-female authors as Tom Clancy.

07:09.938 --> 07:11.560
You know, it goes on and on.

07:12.221 --> 07:13.943
I like the procedural stuff.

07:13.963 --> 07:18.809
I really like Patricia Cornwall.

07:19.370 --> 07:20.611
I like her.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.192
She's good.

07:21.773 --> 07:24.857
Not the one, the newest one, not the one before this.

07:25.597 --> 07:28.381
She took off on a new character and it wasn't happily as good.

07:28.401 --> 07:29.342
I like Jan Grisham.

07:30.704 --> 07:31.525
I like Plum.

07:31.865 --> 07:32.186
Did you?

07:32.226 --> 07:33.688
You really do like the trash.

07:33.768 --> 07:35.129
Oh, yeah.

07:36.211 --> 07:36.671
Hey.

07:36.691 --> 07:38.614
That's, I'm sorry, that's a critical.

07:38.714 --> 07:39.675
Commercial fiction.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.716
Well, I love Dutch Leonard.

07:42.397 --> 07:43.099
Yeah?

07:43.359 --> 07:45.082
He's as commercial as they get.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.665
Hi, Susan.

07:46.886 --> 07:47.006
Hello.

07:47.507 --> 07:48.950
Have you met Nicholas Besbane?

07:49.010 --> 07:49.370
No.

07:50.052 --> 07:50.112
Hi.

07:50.132 --> 07:51.094
This is Susan Goldstein.

07:51.334 --> 07:52.096
Hi, nice to meet you.

07:52.116 --> 07:52.837
Nice to meet you, too.

07:53.137 --> 08:00.772
I was going to take Nicholas down to take a look at the material in Brooks Hall, but I didn't have time.

08:01.413 --> 08:02.435
So if you could do that.

08:02.475 --> 08:02.575
Sure.

08:02.892 --> 08:06.739
And also, I think you'd like to see the archives from the gay and lesbian material.

08:07.040 --> 08:13.372
So if you have 45 minutes or so, I appreciate that a lot.

08:16.859 --> 08:17.440
Thank you.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.263
Okay, the gay and lesbian manuscript.

08:19.684 --> 08:20.766
Just for the tape.

08:20.947 --> 08:25.896
I'm Susan Goldstein of San Francisco History Center, San Francisco Public Library.

08:26.315 --> 08:29.479
The gay and lesbian manuscripts come through our room.

08:29.980 --> 08:37.289
So the gay and lesbian center is made up of many kinds of materials, books, periodicals, and those are all serviced down on the appropriate floor.

08:37.789 --> 08:42.195
And because we have the archives and manuscripts here, people come here to use those materials.

08:42.215 --> 08:44.157
In this room right here.

08:44.317 --> 08:44.778
Can you show me this?

08:44.798 --> 08:46.240
Yeah, we have higher security here.

08:46.841 --> 08:47.902
Well, I hope so.

08:47.922 --> 08:52.127
And we also have archivists on staff who know how to arrange and describe the manuscripts.

08:52.147 --> 08:53.609
Number two pencils, I gather.

08:54.170 --> 08:54.790
What?

08:54.810 --> 08:56.052
As opposed to... Yes.

08:56.572 --> 08:57.253
No pens.

08:58.515 --> 09:00.117
So this is San Francisco History.

09:01.039 --> 09:01.519
Oh, this is nice.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.963
Which is a research area.

09:05.345 --> 09:05.706
Lovely.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.609
And we have some study rooms over here.

09:08.109 --> 09:12.576
You know, there's desks that are facing forward, like our most research libraries.

09:12.596 --> 09:13.037
You can see everybody.

09:13.057 --> 09:14.639
What's that little thing over there?

09:14.940 --> 09:16.602
The microphone reader.

09:21.229 --> 09:22.111
Oh, this.

09:22.131 --> 09:24.294
It's a little momentary.

09:24.775 --> 09:24.975
Oh, I see.

09:25.225 --> 09:26.907
And then we also are digitizing here.

09:26.928 --> 09:34.358
Do you know about that?

09:34.378 --> 09:34.519
No.

09:34.599 --> 09:35.340
Good talk.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.682
I've given the whole day to this.

09:37.643 --> 09:42.090
We are digitizing a few of our collections.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.093
This is a sheet music collection.

09:44.113 --> 09:44.994
I'm going to go back.

09:45.435 --> 09:48.119
And we have a large historic photograph collection here.

09:48.279 --> 09:49.901
So we are starting to digitize that.

09:50.642 --> 09:53.106
And then also the game was being pulped.

09:53.643 --> 09:56.888
We've digitized a lot of their covers.

09:57.249 --> 09:58.290
Very interesting.

09:59.452 --> 10:03.819
So we've worked a little bit with UC Berkeley, but we have our own in-house staff here that's doing it.

10:03.839 --> 10:04.540
What's the site on this?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.423
Is there something I can access from?

10:06.443 --> 10:06.503
No.

10:07.585 --> 10:11.310
It's on standalone, and it's not hooked up to the Internet yet.

10:11.330 --> 10:14.335
It's called the San Francisco Digital Library.

10:16.559 --> 10:18.962
There's little presentations on all the centers.

10:19.062 --> 10:27.594
You could sit and put on earphones, and it would talk about the San Francisco Center, or the African American Center, or the Stegner Environmental Center.

10:28.576 --> 10:31.740
For me to want to look at this, I have to come into this room to do this?

10:31.780 --> 10:36.967
Well, no, they're on all the floors of the library, and they want to put them in the branches.

10:37.548 --> 10:44.878
But I think rather than putting their energy into having a standalone in a branch, they might want to put it into having a

10:45.652 --> 10:47.334
be compatible with the Internet.

10:47.994 --> 10:50.697
So, you know, that's an interesting decision.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.479
I don't know why they went with a standalone.

10:52.499 --> 10:54.941
They should have thought about Internet connectivity.

10:55.021 --> 10:58.325
They changed their mind.

10:59.306 --> 11:01.648
Who's Dorothy Starr, S-T-A-R-R-I?

11:02.028 --> 11:06.052
She's a woman who collected... So this is her collection, largely?

11:06.072 --> 11:07.454
Well, she used it.

11:07.474 --> 11:07.654
No.

11:09.015 --> 11:11.998
This is my puppet.

11:12.018 --> 11:13.600
That's the beauty of it.

11:13.917 --> 11:16.260
You have to hold it.

11:17.401 --> 11:33.300
S-T-E-I-N, right.

11:33.941 --> 11:35.923
What's your title, Susan?

11:35.984 --> 11:39.688
Oh, you're the City Archivist.

11:40.563 --> 11:41.224
Okay.

11:41.465 --> 11:43.670
You've got a lot of materials over in Brooks Hall.

11:44.111 --> 11:44.372
We do.

11:44.612 --> 11:45.314
Yeah.

11:45.334 --> 11:45.514
We do.

11:46.136 --> 11:50.565
And you're showing me the San Francisco Digital Library.

11:50.586 --> 11:53.873
Do you have an idea of how many photographs there are in the collection?

11:53.933 --> 11:56.158
There's about 4,000 in here, but we have...

11:59.092 --> 12:01.316
Really?

12:01.336 --> 12:04.602
4,000 scanned, about 100,000 in the collection?

12:04.742 --> 12:06.886
And these are largely from Dorothy Starz?

12:06.966 --> 12:07.868
No, no, no.

12:07.908 --> 12:09.771
Dorothy Starz is a different collection.

12:09.791 --> 12:11.033
That's sheet music.

12:11.374 --> 12:13.958
And that's being done by the art and music department downstairs.

12:15.982 --> 12:19.528
This is the San Francisco Historic Photograph Collection.

12:19.568 --> 12:20.089
I see.

12:20.109 --> 12:21.572
Here's our photo curator.

12:22.295 --> 12:25.060
And we have our photo store in a separate room.

12:25.080 --> 12:25.941
That's a lot of photos.

12:26.082 --> 12:30.028
Is it negatives, too, or is it... There's negatives.

12:30.128 --> 12:33.094
Glass plates, too.

12:34.596 --> 12:36.519
Do you have adequate space for them?

12:36.539 --> 12:38.523
For the photos, we do.

12:39.965 --> 12:46.176
And this room, again, we're in, is called the... Oh, that would be good.

12:51.944 --> 12:53.586
Good.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.887
Yeah, okay.

12:54.907 --> 12:58.091
So we have all the city records here that we have.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.434
They're not collected very systematically in the city.

13:01.454 --> 13:04.478
That's part of my job.

13:04.498 --> 13:06.300
Do you have a card, by the way?

13:06.420 --> 13:06.800
Yeah, I do.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.122
Give me some card.

13:12.126 --> 13:19.194
I'll give you mine.

13:19.394 --> 13:20.095
Good, thanks.

13:24.293 --> 13:25.976
Okay.

13:25.996 --> 13:27.999
Uh-huh.

13:28.059 --> 13:28.460
Sure.

13:29.722 --> 13:34.009
So most of our books are in the back.

13:34.029 --> 13:37.535
You have a small collection out there.

13:37.555 --> 13:42.983
That's, you know, these are all limited access things.

13:43.845 --> 13:43.965
Yeah.

13:43.985 --> 13:47.551
There's also a collection of book art.

13:47.591 --> 13:47.931
Mm-hmm.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.274
You might want to talk about stuff later.

13:49.534 --> 13:50.115
Okay.

13:50.264 --> 13:55.130
It's a lovely room.

13:57.472 --> 14:00.095
Great.

14:00.135 --> 14:05.482
I'll take everything.

14:06.443 --> 14:13.211
I'll have to take notes.

14:13.631 --> 14:15.093
Right.

14:15.373 --> 14:17.115
I have, yeah.

14:17.450 --> 14:18.595
All right, let's go down.

14:18.656 --> 14:19.882
You want to see where they get?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.469
Let me get the keys.

14:24.082 --> 14:24.544
Come with you?

14:24.946 --> 14:25.247
Yeah.

14:25.368 --> 14:25.468
Okay.

14:25.988 --> 14:26.789
Where are we now?

14:27.651 --> 14:29.514
Back in the house, and I'll be right back.

14:29.554 --> 14:30.235
Okay, stay right here.

14:31.618 --> 14:31.798
Yeah.

14:31.818 --> 14:32.940
You and I have met.

14:33.020 --> 14:34.583
I bought your book.

14:34.683 --> 14:37.067
We're at the Tablepan Aquarium.

14:37.387 --> 14:38.309
Oh, I have one.

14:38.409 --> 14:39.771
We're very proud of this.

14:39.791 --> 14:40.432
We're here.

14:40.453 --> 14:40.713
Thank you.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.576
I'm the manager of all the programs.

14:43.017 --> 14:43.518
Uh-huh.

14:44.519 --> 14:44.740
Good.

14:45.060 --> 14:46.102
Hi, my friends.

14:46.342 --> 14:47.845
Good to meet you.

14:47.825 --> 14:48.806
Pleasure to be here.

14:49.047 --> 14:50.028
You know Andrea?

14:50.229 --> 14:52.312
I know Andrea, yeah.

14:54.154 --> 15:03.668
Hi, Andrea, how are you?

15:04.049 --> 15:04.209
Good.

15:04.229 --> 15:05.471
Nice to see you.

15:06.793 --> 15:07.414
You too.

15:07.454 --> 15:11.520
We just did, and we're going to go on a little tour.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.527
Let's take me down to Brooks Hall.

15:14.567 --> 15:17.111
I'm excited to see it.

15:17.131 --> 15:18.493
I'm going to go to M43.

15:19.014 --> 15:19.134
M?

15:19.635 --> 15:19.915
Yes.

15:19.975 --> 15:21.217
Okay, M43.

15:21.538 --> 15:22.639
I'd like to... Okay, good.

15:22.659 --> 15:28.268
Yeah, I'd like to... Nice to meet you.

15:28.308 --> 15:28.748
Thanks.

15:28.909 --> 15:32.073
Okay, and these are... What do we call these kinds of shelving?

15:32.233 --> 15:32.394
Compact.

15:32.414 --> 15:33.676
Compact shelving.

15:34.737 --> 15:36.800
You're going to feel like burning.

15:37.061 --> 15:37.341
Are you?

15:38.062 --> 15:38.483
No.

15:39.024 --> 15:39.364
No.

15:39.648 --> 15:43.718
But I love librarians, so they're the heroes of this new book.

15:45.443 --> 15:46.926
So nice to hear.

15:47.007 --> 15:47.468
Believe it.

15:48.571 --> 15:49.673
Oh, look, my goodness.

15:51.879 --> 15:55.147
Did you have some cards cataloged?

15:55.548 --> 15:56.290
Oops, I'm sorry.

15:56.860 --> 16:02.345
Yeah, special collections really, they're the last to go when it comes to card catalogs.

16:02.365 --> 16:07.970
And they're the last to get put online because we knew such kind of in-depth catalogs.

16:08.691 --> 16:18.419
We may have until, sorry, we may have until 10.30 to get over to the locked case section of Brooks Hall.

16:18.599 --> 16:19.901
We keep it open from about 10 to 10.30.

16:19.921 --> 16:20.021
Okay.

16:20.041 --> 16:20.261
It's 10.30.

16:20.281 --> 16:22.423
Maybe I can call engineers and ask me to keep it open a little longer.

16:22.543 --> 16:24.084
Yeah, I mean, we'll make it down by then.

16:24.104 --> 16:24.305
Okay.

16:24.325 --> 16:24.825
Thanks.

16:24.805 --> 16:26.167
Yeah, I did want to see that.

16:26.548 --> 16:29.812
Yeah.

16:29.832 --> 16:31.154
So are you a librarian?

16:32.536 --> 16:36.142
Well, I'm an archivist, but yeah, I go to library school.

16:36.242 --> 16:42.090
Now, where did you go to library school?

16:42.110 --> 16:43.372
Really?

16:43.472 --> 16:44.995
So what do you, yeah.

16:45.015 --> 16:45.235
From where?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.196
California woman?

16:47.198 --> 16:50.122
Yeah, but I'm born in California.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.584
So where did you go to college?

16:52.145 --> 16:52.686
To Brown.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.147
I live very close to Brown.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.508
Oh, you do?

16:56.528 --> 16:58.571
I live in Central Mass, which is very close.

16:58.591 --> 17:03.496
We work right next to Worcester, a town called Grafton.

17:03.516 --> 17:05.459
It's about 45 minutes from Providence.

17:05.599 --> 17:11.325
I was close to Providence as I am to Boston.

17:11.345 --> 17:12.026
Providence really changed.

17:13.508 --> 17:15.130
I went back two years ago for a reunion.

17:15.150 --> 17:15.270
Yeah.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.553
I mean, I think it's a really exciting program for what it is.

17:17.573 --> 17:20.496
There's no archives or books.

17:20.864 --> 17:22.967
There's none of that anymore.

17:22.987 --> 17:24.249
So, you know, what does that mean?

17:24.269 --> 17:26.632
Who's the director over there, if you know offhand?

17:28.034 --> 17:28.996
Boy, his name.

17:29.016 --> 17:32.481
I know he's an economics professor, and I'm blanking on his name.

17:32.501 --> 17:33.643
Yeah, I'll find out tomorrow.

17:33.923 --> 17:35.385
I've been in the whole day over there.

17:36.266 --> 17:45.400
I really haven't done any research yet on a library school other than Columbia, which was the great, you know, the original one is gone.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.783
You know, my feeling is,

17:47.965 --> 17:54.995
Berkeley, the system put pressure on the library school to reinvent itself in this way, you know, or else they would have just cut it out.

17:55.295 --> 17:56.818
As Columbia did.

17:56.838 --> 17:57.238
Yeah.

17:57.258 --> 17:59.622
Terry Melanger said, you know, I said, why?

17:59.702 --> 18:02.866
He said, it's not a cash cow.

18:03.407 --> 18:06.031
I mean, like law schools, a lot of money in law schools.

18:06.652 --> 18:10.096
And the alumni, we don't donate as much as other people do.

18:10.237 --> 18:12.159
And, you know, it's what goes on down the line.

18:12.460 --> 18:15.424
But did you value from Columbia?

18:15.725 --> 18:16.606
You're a young woman.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.469
What prompted you to go to the library school?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.232
Well, I loved archives and manuscripts.

18:22.552 --> 18:29.119
I mean, I probably, I mean, I like being a historian, but, you know, I loved archives and manuscripts, and that's why.

18:29.159 --> 18:31.241
And I knew I wanted to do archives when I went to library school.

18:31.321 --> 18:32.682
It wasn't like I discovered it there.

18:33.543 --> 18:37.207
So what did they teach you at library school that was useful, that helped you in this job?

18:37.227 --> 18:39.809
Well, there was actually a great archive course.

18:41.011 --> 18:41.872
That's history, right?

18:41.892 --> 18:42.772
That's history, right.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.314
That's history anymore.

18:45.222 --> 18:46.364
And where did you graduate?

18:46.624 --> 18:48.727
I graduated in 18th.

18:48.747 --> 18:49.628
Okay.

18:50.029 --> 18:56.438
Now we're walking, we're in the bowels of the new library, or are we actually kind of in a... Now we're at the loading dock.

18:57.540 --> 19:04.089
Still in the... So we're about to pass into Brooks Hall, which is kind of pretty gay.

19:04.149 --> 19:05.591
Okay, but it does connect, right?

19:05.611 --> 19:05.792
Oh, yeah.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.053
It's great that it connects.

19:07.194 --> 19:08.175
It's wonderful.

19:08.476 --> 19:09.357
And how to connect.

19:10.278 --> 19:12.961
As I said to Gina, I said, you're damn lucky you have a bookshelf.

19:13.141 --> 19:14.743
Yeah, but we don't have it yet.

19:14.883 --> 19:16.165
I mean, we don't have a solid.

19:16.185 --> 19:18.127
I know that you have it even here.

19:18.207 --> 19:19.389
Never mind that you wrote it.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.149
Yeah, we do.

19:20.230 --> 19:21.151
Yeah, it's great.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.135
So physically it is connected.

19:25.155 --> 19:25.676
Oh, yeah.

19:26.237 --> 19:28.159
It's very easy to come down here and page things.

19:29.060 --> 19:32.103
I have a little different perspective because I worked in university libraries.

19:32.123 --> 19:36.028
A lot of people here are very upset about having to even go this far to page.

19:36.048 --> 19:36.188
Mm-hmm.

19:36.455 --> 19:39.099
You know, at Berkeley, we used to have to go off-site to Richmond.

19:39.119 --> 19:39.840
We're going to go in here.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.084
So to me, this is... I don't mind.

19:42.204 --> 19:47.031
Also, manuscripts, a lot of researchers know they might have to wait overnight to get their collection.

19:47.051 --> 19:56.566
So I think I'm a little bit of an anomaly in the public library system, because... This is the old car catalog.

19:56.626 --> 19:58.228
Are you going to mind if I take a few photographs?

19:58.829 --> 19:59.010
No.

19:59.991 --> 20:00.452
Okay.

20:00.852 --> 20:01.834
I'm sure you told me we were going to.

20:01.854 --> 20:04.538
Yes, I did, and I've got my camera, took some pictures of her, and...

20:05.412 --> 20:06.814
You can just talk.

20:07.636 --> 20:07.976
Okay.

20:07.996 --> 20:09.699
There's a car catalog.

20:09.939 --> 20:11.281
It's brought over.

20:11.301 --> 20:14.126
I'll just put this someplace.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.673
We are now physically in Brooks Hall, right?

20:20.155 --> 20:22.439
I keep losing.

20:26.065 --> 20:27.227
You see, I'm trying to take pictures.

20:27.267 --> 20:31.834
Take notes.

20:32.115 --> 20:32.295
Okay.

20:32.315 --> 20:32.415
Okay.

20:32.868 --> 20:36.576
Should we go over to where they're... You want to go over where they're going to close right now?

20:36.596 --> 20:37.578
Yeah, we're here.

20:37.598 --> 20:42.427
Oh, this is the closed... So what do we call this?

20:43.590 --> 20:47.638
This is the closed, the locked case?

20:47.658 --> 20:48.440
Is that what this is?

20:50.163 --> 20:50.764
Yeah, we have a catalog room.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.448
We don't really have a real name.

20:52.468 --> 20:52.648
Uh-huh.

20:53.827 --> 20:56.910
It's a very small part of the catalog.

20:56.990 --> 21:00.933
Is this what, like the rare books would be in here?

21:01.514 --> 21:01.594
No.

21:01.634 --> 21:12.864
Not rare books, but... Okay, the last two books, which are down here, are books that will work in a lot of people.

21:12.884 --> 21:12.984
Okay.

21:13.004 --> 21:15.106
Now, are there still cards in these catalogs?

21:18.930 --> 21:21.792
It's just not indicated.

21:21.812 --> 21:22.313
Okay.

21:22.333 --> 21:22.433
Okay.

21:22.666 --> 21:23.350
Here they are.

21:23.370 --> 21:27.293
If people come across the floor, it's just from down there.

21:29.534 --> 21:34.201
Okay, this helps me write as much as anything else, by the way.

21:35.242 --> 21:43.234
And what we're doing now is testing down here for temperature and humidity for all the changes we need to to make it a better environment for the book.

21:43.254 --> 21:45.898
You know, it only took us about three minutes to get here.

21:47.079 --> 21:47.260
Oh, yeah.

21:47.280 --> 21:53.248
I mean, this is... Yeah, no, I think it's very convenient.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.530
This is not as it could be, you know?

21:54.550 --> 21:56.032
No, it's wonderful that we have this.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.237
We just need to, you know, clean it up and make it a better environment for these books.

21:59.926 --> 22:02.510
These are lock case books.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.053
Most of these are from Humanities.

22:04.794 --> 22:08.640
How do you feel about that, by the way?

22:08.920 --> 22:11.304
Well, I wasn't here when that happened.

22:12.005 --> 22:17.454
You're going to have to talk to someone else about the drafting of the subject department.

22:17.594 --> 22:19.437
It's not something I have a lot of opinions about.

22:19.457 --> 22:21.360
It happened a long time before I came.

22:21.425 --> 22:22.266
Luck case.

22:22.286 --> 22:23.707
What does it mean, luck case?

22:23.727 --> 22:29.093
These were older, rarer books, and they were lost, and people had to ask for them.

22:29.414 --> 22:30.655
And that's why they're down here.

22:33.037 --> 22:36.962
Mexico as it was and as it is by Mayer.

22:37.062 --> 22:40.005
Pictures of Life in Mexico by Mason, two volumes.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.430
We're actually in history right now, the 900s.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.394
How many books would you say there are in here?

22:48.678 --> 22:49.859
Again, I don't know.

22:49.879 --> 22:51.942
You have to ask the third floor staff.

22:52.443 --> 22:55.927
I'm just going to put this down.

22:58.270 --> 22:58.590
Go ahead.

22:58.610 --> 22:59.131
You can talk.

22:59.171 --> 23:04.878
You can just hold this while you talk because what you say is more important.

23:04.958 --> 23:05.819
Okay.

23:05.879 --> 23:08.743
So these were Lockheed's reference books, basically.

23:11.406 --> 23:11.506
Okay.

23:11.526 --> 23:12.608
But you don't know how many people?

23:12.628 --> 23:13.489
No, I don't know.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.971
So you should ask the third floor staff.

23:14.991 --> 23:16.052
I mean, you can see...

23:16.943 --> 23:21.348
It's not all... It's from here to here, basically.

23:21.388 --> 23:22.710
There's not that many.

23:24.352 --> 23:25.694
This is another collection.

23:25.794 --> 23:28.157
This is the McComas Science Fiction Collection.

23:30.620 --> 23:31.541
McComas.

23:31.561 --> 23:37.588
It must have been the name of the... Yeah, it's a special collection of science fiction.

23:37.728 --> 23:38.990
Probably Mr. McComas.

23:39.010 --> 23:39.530
I don't know.

23:39.590 --> 23:41.272
But again, you should ask the third floor staff.

23:41.773 --> 23:44.056
So this is all down here.

23:44.076 --> 23:45.137
Okay.

23:45.417 --> 23:45.938
And...

23:46.930 --> 23:49.414
People have to request it at the paging desk.

23:49.454 --> 23:50.796
You keep losing your tag.

23:50.816 --> 23:51.537
Let me give it to you.

23:52.839 --> 23:55.263
I don't want security to pounce on you.

23:59.749 --> 23:59.990
Sorry.

24:00.010 --> 24:00.290
You know what?

24:00.330 --> 24:03.595
Just stick it in your pocket, and then you can pull it out and show it to them.

24:03.615 --> 24:05.017
I realize this is a minor detail.

24:05.118 --> 24:09.004
No, it's not minor.

24:11.788 --> 24:14.031
I'm going to put this paperwork in the bag, too.

24:14.051 --> 24:14.372
Yeah.

24:14.492 --> 24:14.592
Yeah.

24:15.905 --> 24:18.747
I don't have that much else to say about these books.

24:20.449 --> 24:24.192
As they shift books upstairs, they're trying to make room for these to go.

24:24.493 --> 24:27.475
These won't go out on the floor because they were in locked cases before.

24:27.495 --> 24:30.718
They'll only ever go in the back stacks upstairs.

24:33.500 --> 24:37.244
I work in a collection that's all referenced, and most of our collection is locked.

24:37.864 --> 24:39.546
You're really going to have to talk to some other people.

24:39.606 --> 24:44.410
Some people feel very strongly that more of their books should be out on the floor.

24:44.558 --> 24:51.493
for patrons to browse, and I have a different perspective for my collection.

24:51.513 --> 24:52.916
Yeah, it's okay.

24:52.936 --> 24:53.337
It's okay.

24:53.357 --> 24:54.920
I would just stick it in your pocket.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.782
Don't even put it on.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.644
It's just going to fall off.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.523
You can see the way I'm working here.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.347
I'm always going to be knocking things off.

25:02.367 --> 25:04.090
And then here's gift books that are waiting.

25:04.110 --> 25:07.074
You know, librarians are going to look at them and decide if they're going to add them to the collection.

25:07.114 --> 25:07.575
It's nothing.

25:07.735 --> 25:10.559
That's science fiction.

25:10.659 --> 25:13.904
And there's a person on the third floor who has responsibility for it.

25:13.924 --> 25:15.205
You might want to talk to him about it.

25:17.569 --> 25:17.669
Yeah.

25:24.238 --> 25:26.441
Okay.

25:26.461 --> 25:27.002
Um...

25:28.636 --> 25:29.997
Oh, is that yours?

25:30.137 --> 25:30.458
Okay.

25:31.739 --> 25:37.845
These are books that are going to be discarded in here.

25:37.865 --> 25:38.366
Okay.

25:38.726 --> 25:39.867
So there's a discard room.

25:41.589 --> 25:45.653
And then these are... These here are discards?

25:45.673 --> 25:47.515
Well, behind this wooden door.

25:49.076 --> 25:49.336
Okay.

25:49.356 --> 25:49.537
In here.

25:49.557 --> 25:50.357
This step too?

25:50.457 --> 25:55.082
These might be, or else they're waiting for the adopt-a-book program to get started again.

25:56.260 --> 25:57.923
There's a lot of, like, old editions.

25:58.243 --> 25:59.145
Well, you can see what's here.

25:59.225 --> 25:59.465
Yeah.

26:01.969 --> 26:04.012
So a lot of these are waiting for adopt-a-book.

26:05.374 --> 26:06.396
These are the classics.

26:06.717 --> 26:11.484
Yeah, but, you know, again, now, I'm not the person over this, so you might want to talk.

26:11.504 --> 26:12.626
I can tell you who to talk to.

26:12.786 --> 26:15.090
How about these old books here?

26:15.290 --> 26:16.071
These are not.

26:16.091 --> 26:18.375
These are waiting on book trucks, and I'm not sure for what.

26:18.415 --> 26:22.542
Different departments have different materials down here for different reasons.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.124
So...

26:24.678 --> 26:29.104
Those are not, I don't think those are for, these are not, for example, for discard.

26:30.466 --> 26:33.950
These are, oh, the Commonwealth Club.

26:35.032 --> 26:36.233
I have to come back and look at that.

26:37.916 --> 26:43.803
Sometimes when I find things down here that I think are appropriate for our collection, I contact that department and ask if I can transfer it.

26:44.364 --> 26:47.508
These are runs of periodicals that, yeah, these are just runs of periodicals.

26:50.352 --> 26:51.313
What does that mean?

26:52.435 --> 26:53.436
What's going on?

26:53.669 --> 26:56.356
I've only had this panel for years until school repair.

26:56.677 --> 27:06.423
Okay, so here's runs of periodicals out here, and then down here you're going to have a lot of periodicals, all the way down.

27:06.483 --> 27:08.087
This is cavernous.

27:08.107 --> 27:09.872
Yeah, it is, but we only have part of it.

27:10.578 --> 27:11.019
You'll see.

27:11.059 --> 27:11.960
We only have half of it.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.302
This used to be an exhibition hall.

27:13.322 --> 27:14.063
Yeah, it was.

27:14.084 --> 27:14.624
Right, yeah.

27:14.644 --> 27:16.287
They had conventions here and conferences.

27:16.307 --> 27:18.270
Can I just pause for a second and take a couple of minutes?

27:18.290 --> 27:18.390
Yeah.

27:18.410 --> 27:19.212
Were you ever down here?

27:19.652 --> 27:20.093
No, no.

27:20.113 --> 27:21.175
This is the first time.

27:21.435 --> 27:22.477
I mean, in a way, it's nice.

27:22.537 --> 27:23.859
It's got electricity.

27:23.879 --> 27:25.001
It's got, you know, hookups.

27:25.241 --> 27:28.045
It's got, it needs to be cleaned up, but it's got stuff.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.207
I mean, there's acreage here.

27:29.307 --> 27:29.788
Oh, yeah.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.571
I like it down here.

27:32.593 --> 27:32.693
Yeah.

27:32.773 --> 27:32.873
Yeah.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.443
This is all library stuff, right?

27:35.644 --> 27:35.904
No.

27:35.984 --> 27:38.368
Over there, I think the opera... We'll walk around.

27:38.408 --> 27:39.370
I think they still have it.

27:39.751 --> 27:44.118
First, when we came in, Moscone Center had some space, and now I think the opera does, or the symphony.

27:44.238 --> 27:44.859
I think the opera.

27:45.220 --> 27:45.380
Okay.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.602
Reserve for recon.

27:46.622 --> 27:47.023
What does that mean?

27:47.043 --> 27:54.556
These are books that staff needed to go all the way back through them and enter bibliographic records for them.

27:54.836 --> 27:56.079
So what does recon mean, though?

27:56.640 --> 27:56.920
Um...

27:57.085 --> 28:03.015
Recon is when you go back and put books into DRA, into the database, that were not put into the database.

28:03.256 --> 28:03.616
I see.

28:03.837 --> 28:07.924
So like at Berkeley, they did a huge recon project and put all their old books into the database.

28:07.944 --> 28:09.687
And these books are part of the collection?

28:10.328 --> 28:10.588
Yes.

28:11.349 --> 28:14.555
But they're books that there weren't records for them.

28:14.795 --> 28:22.789
So now that they're through recon, staff needs to come downstairs and see which ones they want to keep in the collection and which ones they don't.

28:24.997 --> 28:26.138
You can keep talking.

28:26.619 --> 28:28.500
I don't have much to say about it.

28:29.762 --> 28:34.787
This is like the guy that plays the harmonica and the... Yeah.

28:35.187 --> 28:35.688
This is how I work.

28:35.708 --> 28:36.589
The fiddle at the same time.

28:36.629 --> 28:38.210
Yeah.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.212
I like to document things.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.413
So, recon.

28:41.473 --> 28:44.577
You know, a lot of libraries have recon departments now.

28:45.097 --> 28:47.239
People try to get grants to do recon work.

28:48.260 --> 28:53.065
This is done, and I think it's waiting for the subject selectors and departments to come down and look at their areas.

28:53.185 --> 28:54.126
I have been through here.

28:54.427 --> 28:56.889
as has Andrea, looking for stuff for our collections.

28:56.910 --> 28:58.211
Okay.

28:58.231 --> 29:02.515
Coming in here looking for stuff that... I think mine might want in San Francisco history.

29:03.056 --> 29:03.356
Really?

29:03.376 --> 29:03.496
Okay.

29:04.817 --> 29:06.659
Let me just take a shot here.

29:06.679 --> 29:08.982
Yeah, I went through this row by row.

29:10.123 --> 29:10.503
You did?

29:10.663 --> 29:10.944
Yeah.

29:11.124 --> 29:11.845
Did you find anything?

29:12.105 --> 29:15.969
Yeah, although a lot of the books that were here, we already had copies of in our collection.

29:16.810 --> 29:18.852
Some old books on San Francisco history.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.233
You know, some we didn't have yet.

29:20.714 --> 29:22.195
Thanks.

29:22.555 --> 29:22.876
Yeah.

29:23.396 --> 29:24.197
I know that...

29:24.903 --> 29:26.585
Special Collections found some books.

29:27.245 --> 29:30.488
You really should talk to Andrea because she found some rare books down here.

29:30.508 --> 29:32.350
Or old books.

29:32.370 --> 29:32.970
What's a rare book?

29:33.030 --> 29:37.614
Old books that were printed in the 1700s, 1800s, early American imprints.

29:42.178 --> 29:42.579
Okay.

29:42.819 --> 29:44.080
These are the periodicals.

29:45.501 --> 29:47.743
These are the periodicals that did not fit upstairs.

29:48.564 --> 29:48.904
Okay?

29:49.525 --> 29:52.868
And so this is periodical stuff has to come down and page these.

29:53.995 --> 29:56.357
There's a lot of discussion about these.

29:56.377 --> 30:01.682
We have a new periodicals committee that met last week for the first time about how to handle all these.

30:01.902 --> 30:07.947
Do we want Canadian Journal of Soil Science from the 60s, or do we want it maybe to go to an academic library that's local?

30:08.287 --> 30:13.352
Canadian Journal of Soil Science, 1967 to 84.

30:13.552 --> 30:16.234
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight lines.

30:16.354 --> 30:17.536
Yeah.

30:17.556 --> 30:22.720
So they paged, you know, you should talk to magazine and newspaper staff, but they paged...

30:23.662 --> 30:24.904
periodicals down here every day.

30:24.944 --> 30:26.426
They come down and do a run.

30:27.848 --> 30:28.890
It's pretty extensive.

30:28.930 --> 30:30.532
You can see all the way down.

30:31.013 --> 30:33.497
I just pulled up two journals for our collection.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.101
One of them I love.

30:37.242 --> 30:38.384
What is it called?

30:39.225 --> 30:40.387
Pacific Progressive.

30:40.988 --> 30:44.393
It's all about the progressive movement and it runs from like 1900 to 1915.

30:44.513 --> 30:47.217
It's all the progressive movement on the West Coast.

30:47.518 --> 30:50.743
It's transferred into San Francisco history now.

30:52.345 --> 30:52.926
So,

30:53.328 --> 30:53.828
Wow.

30:54.169 --> 30:54.509
Yeah.

30:55.190 --> 30:55.410
Okay.

30:55.950 --> 30:56.231
Yeah.

30:57.732 --> 30:58.213
These are.

30:58.233 --> 31:00.495
Oh, I'm guessing for the sake of the tape here.

31:01.356 --> 31:02.617
How much footage?

31:02.637 --> 31:05.620
Yeah, I'd say that's about 100 yards, maybe 80.

31:06.661 --> 31:07.141
You think so?

31:09.083 --> 31:10.464
Oh, yeah.

31:10.484 --> 31:11.966
That's the size of a football field.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.607
Well, hard to say.

31:14.868 --> 31:18.332
Actually, I know the measurements of these cubes, actually.

31:18.432 --> 31:19.673
It's 48 feet.

31:20.260 --> 31:24.084
One, two, three, four, five, six.

31:24.104 --> 31:26.466
I don't know if you'd call these alcoves or whatever.

31:26.626 --> 31:29.789
Well, this is... Just hold that.

31:29.809 --> 31:30.490
I'll take some time.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.371
These squares are 48 by 48.

31:33.773 --> 31:36.335
What squares?

31:36.355 --> 31:37.797
See where that... There's a line here.

31:38.037 --> 31:38.517
Okay.

31:38.537 --> 31:40.119
This is that line.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.182
And then there should be another line right around here.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.664
What do you call this area that we're in now?

31:45.684 --> 31:46.505
Do you call it anything?

31:46.525 --> 31:48.867
No, just a periodical section of Brooks.

31:49.268 --> 31:50.390
These are all periodic?

31:50.410 --> 31:50.750
Yes.

31:51.812 --> 31:53.434
I will show you where the city archives are.

31:53.454 --> 31:54.155
We're not there yet.

31:54.195 --> 31:55.837
Okay, there's a chain-link fence.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.201
This is unbelievable.

31:58.982 --> 32:02.347
I'm so used to it.

32:02.387 --> 32:08.275
Carol, let's walk down the side of it.

32:08.295 --> 32:08.515
Okay, yeah.

32:08.535 --> 32:08.616
Wow.

32:08.636 --> 32:09.337
Here.

32:09.357 --> 32:09.737
Thanks.

32:17.008 --> 32:17.368
Wow.

32:19.154 --> 32:29.606
How about books that were, books that were discarded and that were dumped?

32:29.626 --> 32:30.486
Were they here?

32:30.667 --> 32:31.508
Is this where they were?

32:32.829 --> 32:36.113
No, I think, again, I wasn't... That's fine.

32:36.133 --> 32:37.154
I'm not putting you on the spot.

32:37.194 --> 32:39.016
I'm not quoting you.

32:39.597 --> 32:41.659
No, I think most of the books were readed from the old building.

32:42.119 --> 32:43.120
I think they were gone.

32:43.140 --> 32:43.841
They never got here.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.123
Right, they never got here.

32:46.024 --> 32:46.384
I see.

32:46.684 --> 32:47.305
So...

32:48.314 --> 32:50.557
So these are basically books that are in the collection.

32:50.597 --> 32:50.837
Yeah.

32:51.358 --> 32:51.739
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:51.759 --> 32:53.040
These are books that are in the collection.

32:53.621 --> 32:55.824
So these squares, you see what I mean?

32:55.844 --> 32:56.785
It goes to these columns.

32:56.825 --> 32:58.027
There's like little lines.

32:58.247 --> 32:58.688
Okay.

32:58.728 --> 33:00.330
That's 48 by 48.

33:00.811 --> 33:02.252
So... 48 feet by 48 feet, right?

33:02.453 --> 33:02.833
Mm-hmm.

33:03.594 --> 33:04.295
So I was right.

33:04.395 --> 33:05.957
So that's 50, 100, 150.

33:05.977 --> 33:06.879
It's about 200 feet.

33:07.199 --> 33:08.240
There's another one.

33:08.721 --> 33:09.642
There's about four of them.

33:10.023 --> 33:10.664
So that's 200 feet.

33:10.684 --> 33:11.044
200 feet.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.969
Almost all football field is 300 feet.

33:14.989 --> 33:15.890
I don't even know.

33:16.972 --> 33:17.072
Okay.

33:17.626 --> 33:22.673
Okay, this area, so this bay down here, these are all periodicals.

33:23.334 --> 33:27.540
This area belongs to different subject departments.

33:27.560 --> 33:27.740
Mm-hmm.

33:27.760 --> 33:27.860
Okay?

33:28.501 --> 33:33.909
And they haven't moved over all these boxes at the end, and they haven't yet, yet a secondary move.

33:33.969 --> 33:36.813
After the initial move, all this stuff was left in the old library.

33:36.833 --> 33:37.774
I love the little trunk.

33:38.395 --> 33:39.677
Go ahead, this is great.

33:39.697 --> 33:40.258
Yeah.

33:40.278 --> 33:43.743
So we moved all this stuff over later, a year after we opened.

33:43.803 --> 33:43.903
Okay.

33:44.288 --> 33:45.049
Uh-huh.

33:45.109 --> 33:47.012
And the staff has not had time.

33:47.393 --> 33:51.660
We're very short-staffed upstairs because we've lost people, you know, to attrition.

33:52.321 --> 33:55.406
So we haven't had time to put stuff away.

33:57.229 --> 33:58.491
I asked her about that.

33:58.552 --> 34:03.500
It's recording.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.523
I haven't lost one yet.

34:06.004 --> 34:07.046
Knock on wood.

34:07.486 --> 34:09.790
This is art and music staff.

34:10.968 --> 34:13.031
And each bay is a different compartment.

34:13.112 --> 34:14.093
Okay, art music stops.

34:14.213 --> 34:15.395
These are general collections.

34:15.536 --> 34:18.801
These are gift books that the librarians use.

34:19.001 --> 34:20.704
Oh, there's some music scores.

34:21.766 --> 34:22.467
There's music scores.

34:22.487 --> 34:25.051
There's tons of boxes of music scores.

34:25.111 --> 34:29.258
From that collection?

34:29.278 --> 34:31.522
Yeah, Dorothy Stars here.

34:31.682 --> 34:32.403
Dorothy Stars here?

34:32.423 --> 34:32.944
Oh, God.

34:32.964 --> 34:33.365
Oh, God.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.647
Some things are just... Wait.

34:36.128 --> 34:38.871
This is my section.

34:38.891 --> 34:39.552
That's for laughs.

34:39.572 --> 34:42.315
Some things just present themselves to you, don't they, huh?

34:45.499 --> 34:46.600
Come on now.

34:46.620 --> 34:47.341
Isn't that great?

34:47.361 --> 34:49.303
We found that when we were... Oh, that's great.

34:50.785 --> 34:51.726
This is your section.

34:51.766 --> 34:52.087
Yes.

34:52.567 --> 34:53.949
That's the demarcation line.

34:54.429 --> 34:55.791
There's an actual line?

34:56.712 --> 35:00.857
Well, it's just a thing in the... The Brooks Hall.

35:00.877 --> 35:01.758
Oh, that's great.

35:04.821 --> 35:05.222
Okay.

35:05.242 --> 35:05.342
Okay.

35:06.554 --> 35:08.556
That is, that is great.

35:09.197 --> 35:15.223
First we hang it out on the gate up there, we walk in on the chicken wire, but it wouldn't, it's, it's heavy.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.125
I'll bet it's, it's solid brass.

35:22.490 --> 35:27.875
Right here, here's the lighting center.

35:27.895 --> 35:28.015
Okay.

35:28.035 --> 35:31.919
That'll come in, that the librarian mentioned, you can compose, and see what's in here.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.042
Brooks Hall.

35:35.815 --> 35:40.241
sign as the demarcation line for your department.

35:40.361 --> 35:42.985
Well, this line in the ground is really... Right.

35:43.005 --> 35:50.856
Look at these beautiful old... Yeah, we brought these from our... And then the door to the store... All right, and this is government documents.

35:50.876 --> 35:53.239
And our area ends right behind the filing cabinet.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.381
That's storage.

35:54.952 --> 35:56.654
And this is storage for library staff.

35:56.694 --> 35:59.919
Now, we did save and bring over a lot of the old furniture.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.541
This is the rare books from in the library.

36:02.102 --> 36:05.566
These are display cases or storage cases.

36:05.586 --> 36:06.588
Yeah, it was really difficult to move.

36:06.788 --> 36:07.950
They're beautiful.

36:07.970 --> 36:09.512
But we insisted they bring them over.

36:09.532 --> 36:10.173
They're wonderful.

36:10.773 --> 36:13.277
And we're going to put supplies in our books or something.

36:13.297 --> 36:14.438
Well, you're going to leave them down here.

36:14.499 --> 36:15.420
Mm-hmm.

36:15.460 --> 36:16.601
Yeah, I'll take a picture of that.

36:19.265 --> 36:22.790
And this is old storage for library staff.

36:22.810 --> 36:24.452
Are you familiar with my book?

36:24.702 --> 36:28.228
You know, I, I, I, no, I don't know.

36:28.388 --> 36:29.330
Well, that's fine.

36:29.350 --> 36:29.891
That's fine.

36:29.911 --> 36:32.295
All I'm saying is that if... Yeah, I have to read it now.

36:32.595 --> 36:36.882
No, because... I didn't realize you were the person I was meeting with today or I could have done my homework.

36:36.902 --> 36:38.745
There's a method to my madness, you see.

36:38.866 --> 36:41.189
I just try and get everything.

36:41.790 --> 36:44.395
I document everything.

36:45.096 --> 36:47.520
Well, eight years, I mean, in that case.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.781
Oh, this is wonderful stuff, huh?

36:49.801 --> 36:51.924
What did you do before you wrote that book?

36:52.525 --> 36:54.348
I've been a book critic for 20 years.

36:54.749 --> 36:57.393
Oh, you went for in Boston?

36:57.533 --> 37:01.759
In Worcester, but I'm syndicated in 25 newspapers now.

37:01.939 --> 37:06.126
Unfortunately, none here, but I've been hoping to change that.

37:06.987 --> 37:14.098
And now doing a children's book column, which is...

37:14.500 --> 37:16.683
It's been picked up by some really big papers.

37:17.004 --> 37:19.287
Really?

37:19.307 --> 37:26.718
Orlando and San Antonio, Denver, I hope, Knoxville.

37:26.738 --> 37:29.442
I was in about two million circulation in the kids' books.

37:29.762 --> 37:30.904
Old furniture we brought over.

37:30.944 --> 37:33.848
That's the old library commissioner's table that we brought over.

37:33.868 --> 37:36.132
That used to be in our history room across the street.

37:36.152 --> 37:36.292
Really?

37:36.813 --> 37:38.415
So why didn't they keep it, I wonder?

37:39.340 --> 37:40.963
Everything was modern in the new building.

37:43.026 --> 37:47.473
I'd take those any day of the year to tell you the truth.

37:47.513 --> 37:56.588
I'm going to take a picture of you, if you mind.

37:58.571 --> 37:59.593
Mike tour guy.

38:02.273 --> 38:03.475
Your turn, guys.

38:04.556 --> 38:04.636
Yes.

38:04.656 --> 38:05.938
Here he comes.

38:05.958 --> 38:10.044
See, we had artists back in our collection.

38:10.064 --> 38:12.487
We had this huge area in the old building called the Morgue.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.109
It was a disgusting, horrible area.

38:14.169 --> 38:18.155
Well, that's a good, that's a very reputable newspaper.

38:18.175 --> 38:22.521
So now we have, now we have what we call the Morgue again for us.

38:22.541 --> 38:22.701
Okay.

38:22.721 --> 38:25.605
So we have stuff like, this is an old street painting.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.007
This is a great picture, by the way.

38:27.047 --> 38:27.948
You can get in the picture.

38:28.188 --> 38:29.130
I like you in the picture.

38:29.590 --> 38:29.931
Go ahead.

38:30.051 --> 38:30.672
Keep talking.

38:30.712 --> 38:30.812
Okay.

38:32.513 --> 38:35.597
We have other artifacts here.

38:37.560 --> 38:37.981
You do?

38:39.042 --> 38:43.489
Yeah.

38:43.589 --> 38:52.461
This is a safe, a lurid safe.

38:52.481 --> 38:56.547
And then what you're going to see is a lot of production.

38:56.864 --> 38:59.047
Okay, this area, our area stops here.

38:59.127 --> 39:00.609
This is all the opera.

39:00.689 --> 39:03.412
This is no longer the library.

39:03.452 --> 39:06.276
Right, and this ramp goes up into Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.

39:06.296 --> 39:06.736
Okay.

39:07.537 --> 39:09.700
And I've actually been promised that it would be locked.

39:09.720 --> 39:10.080
Oh, it is.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.862
The gate is down.

39:13.204 --> 39:19.252
You know, of course, we would like at least all the space we have and even more, which I guess Gina is now going to bat for.

39:19.352 --> 39:20.213
But it's very political.

39:20.313 --> 39:22.095
Other city departments want this space.

39:22.362 --> 39:22.823
Oh, I think so.

39:22.843 --> 39:25.206
The mayor wanted, there was going to be a computer museum.

39:25.567 --> 39:27.350
Bill Maher wanted it to park cars in.

39:27.430 --> 39:29.272
I mean, even since I've been here.

39:29.593 --> 39:30.955
And what did you call this thing again?

39:31.195 --> 39:35.302
This is a street sanitation, street sweeper outfit.

39:35.322 --> 39:36.644
I don't know what it's like that you call it.

39:37.325 --> 39:39.588
San Francisco cleaning.

39:40.249 --> 39:40.930
Oh, that's great.

39:45.056 --> 39:46.699
Household garbage.

39:46.719 --> 39:48.201
We don't have a lot of artifacts.

39:48.468 --> 39:53.513
You know, we try only to collect paper documents, but we do have some.

39:53.533 --> 39:55.996
Well, they're all part of the texture of the city, you know.

39:56.016 --> 39:56.436
Yeah.

39:56.596 --> 40:02.282
There's a museum of the city of San Francisco with the woman who's archivist for many years left and started.

40:02.302 --> 40:03.063
And these are what?

40:03.263 --> 40:06.346
These are old newspapers, San Francisco Bulletin.

40:06.567 --> 40:07.327
I see.

40:07.407 --> 40:12.152
Most of them we have on Microsoft, but I do the process of checking to make sure before we moved them.

40:12.913 --> 40:13.834
And some of these...

40:14.017 --> 40:22.187
Some of these are in really horrible condition, and they're not worth keeping anymore.

40:23.029 --> 40:30.058
And there's something at Berkeley called the California Newspaper Project, and they're doing a survey of all the old newspapers in the state.

40:30.558 --> 40:35.144
You should contact the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, which has the finest.

40:35.164 --> 40:38.168
It's even greater than the Library of Congress.

40:38.738 --> 40:41.644
Well, this might go past their cutoff.

40:41.724 --> 40:42.285
This won't go.

40:42.305 --> 40:46.814
They go up to 1876, but they come forward a lot further with the West.

40:48.157 --> 40:48.698
Yeah.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.123
I might just tell them, sis, that bulletin.

40:51.745 --> 40:52.005
Yeah.

40:53.656 --> 40:56.139
These are nice for education.

40:56.159 --> 41:00.365
I don't know about that, but I think they're great for kids to come in and look at primary sources.

41:00.485 --> 41:03.990
I'm going to tell Ellen Dunlap, who's the librarian there.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.833
If she's interested, she'll leave you a call.

41:05.993 --> 41:10.299
She must go to the FAA meeting.

41:10.459 --> 41:11.661
Oh, they're huge.

41:11.701 --> 41:13.964
You've heard of the American Aquarius Society.

41:13.984 --> 41:18.330
That's one of the great, great... Okay, this is the Examiner Clipping Morgue.

41:19.271 --> 41:20.693
Okay, all these file cabinets.

41:20.909 --> 41:22.091
Mm-hmm.

41:24.714 --> 41:26.176
How come it's not at the examiner?

41:27.678 --> 41:29.040
They gave it to us.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.301
Wow, they must have digitized it.

41:30.321 --> 41:35.368
They cut off to it, and I can't remember what it is, but in the 70s maybe.

41:35.388 --> 41:43.038
So, and upstairs we have the call bulletin photograph morgue, which gets used a lot.

41:43.058 --> 41:44.199
That's important stuff.

41:45.061 --> 41:45.381
Yes.

41:46.559 --> 41:48.422
And there's not an index to the Examiner.

41:48.482 --> 41:49.924
There is an index to the Chronicle.

41:49.944 --> 41:50.565
Really?

41:50.585 --> 41:52.268
There's not an index to the Examiner.

41:52.308 --> 41:55.012
So you need to come down and pull things when people want them.

41:55.032 --> 41:57.376
Yeah, I mean, I've worked in newspapers, you know.

41:58.017 --> 41:58.899
That's the way it is.

41:58.939 --> 42:00.121
There are no indexes.

42:00.141 --> 42:01.062
No.

42:01.142 --> 42:04.107
Okay, these are collections we brought over.

42:04.167 --> 42:06.471
These are the Civil Service Commission.

42:07.452 --> 42:07.993
Mm-hmm.

42:08.875 --> 42:09.455
They're ledgers.

42:09.836 --> 42:11.639
They go back to 1960 now.

42:12.140 --> 42:13.141
These are from the 30s.

42:14.003 --> 42:14.203
Mm-hmm.

42:14.538 --> 42:16.180
And we score these here.

42:16.240 --> 42:20.024
Civil Service turned over about 85 years of their stuff to us.

42:20.224 --> 42:21.966
And we do get calls for things sometimes.

42:22.506 --> 42:23.527
So we do have papers.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.269
These are from Department of Public Works.

42:25.589 --> 42:26.610
This is from City Engineer.

42:27.571 --> 42:30.434
These are all collections that archivists need to work on.

42:30.454 --> 42:34.879
We haven't had any time, but, you know, these are really interesting.

42:34.899 --> 42:37.762
This is an archaeological dig.

42:38.122 --> 42:38.402
Really?

42:38.463 --> 42:39.464
Done at the site.

42:39.584 --> 42:42.807
Before they could build the library, you know, you have to do digs.

42:43.698 --> 42:46.202
And these are some of the things that were pulled up.

42:46.302 --> 42:53.894
This is probably a capital from a... This might be from the old city hall that was on this site before it fell in the earthquake.

42:54.335 --> 42:55.136
Some of these things.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.340
And there's some stuff in our exhibit.

42:57.380 --> 43:00.745
There's spoons and poems and things like that.

43:00.765 --> 43:02.768
This is wax from Art Agnes' collection.

43:02.989 --> 43:04.671
So we have some mayoral papers here.

43:04.751 --> 43:05.132
God.

43:05.433 --> 43:08.136
You know, I believe I went to college with Art Agnos.

43:08.156 --> 43:09.417
Did you?

43:09.437 --> 43:09.557
Where?

43:09.577 --> 43:10.719
At Bates College in Maine.

43:10.739 --> 43:11.319
Oh, in Maine?

43:11.399 --> 43:11.640
Yeah.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.061
I believe it was the same.

43:13.081 --> 43:16.285
How many Art Agnoses can there be in the world?

43:16.305 --> 43:18.747
I'm pretty sure it is, because I ran into a guy I knew.

43:18.767 --> 43:20.730
He was a football player.

43:20.790 --> 43:24.053
Did you know that Agnos was the mayor of San Francisco?

43:24.073 --> 43:24.554
Very funny.

43:25.254 --> 43:28.178
These are like the Department of Public Works, like I was showing you.

43:28.958 --> 43:29.879
But they're very interesting.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.263
Hunters Point and Alameda Naval Base sites, 1920.

43:33.833 --> 43:36.517
There's stuff in here I would love to get in and organize.

43:36.817 --> 43:39.201
You know, it takes years to make these collections ready for the public.

43:39.221 --> 43:40.082
Look at that, though.

43:40.102 --> 43:40.783
Isn't that wonderful?

43:40.803 --> 43:41.625
Oh, that's fascinating.

43:41.665 --> 43:44.429
Yeah, I mean, look at them building ships.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.652
I was over there in the 60s.

43:46.953 --> 43:47.654
Oh, I love these stuff.

43:47.694 --> 43:49.817
My ship was actually in one of these dry docks.

43:49.837 --> 43:51.399
Here's an excavation for a dry dock.

43:51.559 --> 43:52.080
Your ship?

43:52.341 --> 43:53.983
Oh, your stationery.

43:54.103 --> 43:57.208
I was a public affairs officer on an aircraft carrier.

43:57.308 --> 43:58.710
Oh, that's a lot of musical people get there.

43:59.703 --> 44:01.185
I worked for Senator Cranston.

44:01.225 --> 44:02.547
Oh, is that right?

44:02.728 --> 44:11.461
And he, it was interesting because I did his pre-senatorial stuff back to Office of War Information, OWI, when he was there and some of the stuff he did.

44:12.262 --> 44:13.384
So you worked in Washington?

44:13.404 --> 44:13.604
Yes.

44:13.905 --> 44:14.446
Oh, good.

44:15.888 --> 44:16.769
Dumbarton Bridge.

44:16.950 --> 44:18.252
I mean, 1920 to 1922.

44:18.792 --> 44:21.036
There's, I think, a goldmine of stuff in here.

44:21.096 --> 44:24.802
This came to us pretty recently, right before the library moved.

44:25.683 --> 44:26.284
And this is,

44:26.669 --> 44:32.116
To me, this should be the meat and potatoes of our collection that we are able to work on.

44:32.276 --> 44:35.200
Do you have material, in your view, at research depth?

44:36.362 --> 44:48.518
Let me preface this by saying that Gina does not believe that a public library like San Francisco, its function is to be a research library, with the possible exception of local history.

44:48.598 --> 44:53.605
I think the local history section should be research depth, and we do.

44:53.855 --> 44:58.680
There's California Historical Society, which is right near us, and they have a lot of important collections.

44:59.060 --> 45:01.723
And there's the Bancroft, and they have a lot of important collections.

45:02.264 --> 45:03.305
There's the Labor Archives.

45:03.325 --> 45:05.147
I used to work there at San Francisco State.

45:05.187 --> 45:08.250
They have a lot of union papers, which are important.

45:08.270 --> 45:15.918
But we have some mayoral papers, and especially we need to really focus on getting the city department papers.

45:16.018 --> 45:17.540
That should be our charge.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.261
We should be the city archives.

45:19.282 --> 45:20.723
The stuff shouldn't be going to Berkeley anymore.

45:21.074 --> 45:23.397
or to CHS, to a private institution.

45:23.417 --> 45:25.060
I've got to take a picture of Art Agnos.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.184
It's black.

45:28.204 --> 45:29.166
I'll show it to Art.

45:29.186 --> 45:30.548
Am I able to get in touch with him?

45:30.888 --> 45:31.770
I knew him, you know.

45:32.871 --> 45:35.355
Well, you have his wife on the library commission.

45:35.375 --> 45:35.655
Is that right?

45:35.675 --> 45:38.299
He's one of the library commissioners, if you're going to talk to them.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.140
I'd probably not.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.362
I talked to Steve Coulter.

45:40.583 --> 45:41.123
That's enough.

45:44.929 --> 45:46.692
Without any comment, let's just leave it at that.

45:47.673 --> 45:50.457
One commissioner would have... Would you think so?

45:51.365 --> 45:52.807
Yeah, he's pretty interesting.

45:53.348 --> 45:53.709
He is.

45:54.370 --> 45:58.176
And we just, this was not conceived of in the original move.

45:58.196 --> 46:00.560
We had a plan for this whole secondary move.

46:00.580 --> 46:09.434
We had ripped out this old shelving from our morgue, you know, well old shelving, moved it over, and I'm starting to put collections on here as they come in.

46:09.454 --> 46:11.257
This is all campus historically.

46:14.703 --> 46:16.866
So, um, this is campus, civil service.

46:17.150 --> 46:18.892
put off my machine.

46:18.912 --> 46:21.054
I worked in the Gernstein photography collection.

46:21.474 --> 46:22.054
How old are you?

46:22.475 --> 46:24.497
That was before library school.

46:24.517 --> 46:24.857
I'm 38.

46:24.957 --> 46:26.859
That was before library school.

46:26.919 --> 46:30.322
I worked there just for about eight months.

46:30.362 --> 46:31.263
Read my HRC.

46:31.363 --> 46:33.225
That's the best chapter.

46:33.665 --> 46:36.247
You know their conservation lab and everything.

46:36.608 --> 46:38.489
Take a look at my book.

46:38.529 --> 46:39.791
I'm reading it tonight.

46:40.151 --> 46:45.756
There are definitely city records.

46:46.276 --> 46:48.419
There are different kinds of vital records.

46:48.639 --> 47:03.157
There are naturalization records, quoting records, block and street maps, American citizens.

47:03.177 --> 47:06.001
Which aren't necessarily the things you'd find in a public library.

47:06.021 --> 47:07.303
I guess maybe so.

47:07.363 --> 47:10.126
Some public libraries have local history rooms in that.

47:11.288 --> 47:13.971
Let me just say, there's not a city archives.

47:14.356 --> 47:20.466
If the city of San Francisco had set up some kind of records management and archives program, it would be different.

47:20.686 --> 47:21.908
But it hasn't been.

47:21.948 --> 47:25.754
And this department has always collected these on an ad hoc basis.

47:25.914 --> 47:28.859
I'm the first archivist they've had here, you know.

47:28.899 --> 47:30.281
Probably ever.

47:30.422 --> 47:33.887
Well, no, Gladys, you know, was here for many years and builds up the collection.

47:33.907 --> 47:34.408
Gladys who?

47:34.728 --> 47:35.209
Hansen.

47:35.249 --> 47:36.431
She's very famous.

47:37.453 --> 47:38.274
She's still alive?

47:38.294 --> 47:38.775
Oh, yeah.

47:38.875 --> 47:41.359
She runs the Museum of the City of San Francisco.

47:41.609 --> 47:42.830
Gladys Hanson.

47:43.150 --> 47:43.891
H-A-N-S-O-N?

47:44.452 --> 47:45.392
S-E-N, I think.

47:46.233 --> 47:47.094
Your predecessor?

47:47.114 --> 47:47.394
Yes.

47:48.575 --> 47:50.817
And she really built this collection.

47:52.559 --> 48:02.048
But she didn't organize collections according to archival practices.

48:03.049 --> 48:05.211
And she didn't systematically go after city records.

48:06.152 --> 48:06.652
As you do.

48:07.032 --> 48:08.714
Well, as I'm trying to do.

48:09.435 --> 48:09.895
So...

48:10.297 --> 48:12.300
You know, we need to figure out our mission in the library.

48:12.660 --> 48:20.451
Do they really want me to do that before I go out and bring in... If I'm not going to get support from the administration for doing it, do I have to step in here?

48:20.571 --> 48:21.052
That's right.

48:21.753 --> 48:27.361
Now, this is a great place to take your picture once more, okay?

48:27.381 --> 48:29.604
These are deeds.

48:29.624 --> 48:30.244
This is nice.

48:30.305 --> 48:33.269
And these deeds go back... Some of them go back to the 1850s.

48:33.409 --> 48:36.653
I mean, some of these are some of the oldest records we have in the city.

48:37.434 --> 48:38.616
So...

48:38.900 --> 48:43.565
Well, I love this stuff.

48:43.585 --> 48:44.967
This stuff is great.

48:45.848 --> 48:47.910
I get excited by things, you know.

48:50.793 --> 48:58.362
Well, I mean, when you read my book, I mean, the gentle madness describes me, too, you know.

48:58.622 --> 49:06.971
And I'm just frustrated that we can't, we don't have the time to come down here and work on these and make them, you know, we need to do, we need to enter stuff in the computer and make lists and, you know, all that stuff.

49:08.013 --> 49:08.333
Um...

49:08.667 --> 49:12.832
Mayor's certificates are on microfilm in the city registrar's office.

49:13.012 --> 49:14.093
We deal with the people there.

49:14.113 --> 49:18.438
We need to coordinate all the microfilming so we know what we don't need to do.

49:18.478 --> 49:22.683
If you get this as a permanent space, one wonders if you'd ever allow readers down here.

49:22.703 --> 49:23.945
We take readers down now.

49:23.985 --> 49:28.710
In fact, someone was going to come in at 1030 to do research.

49:28.730 --> 49:31.333
People can make an appointment, and I am...

49:31.516 --> 49:33.180
Me or someone on staff will take them down.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.786
Definitely, because they need access to this stuff.

49:35.807 --> 49:36.669
That's the way to do it.

49:36.689 --> 49:38.333
No, we need to give access.

49:38.353 --> 49:43.606
Because you can't have somebody... People use these... I know, I have a little face mask.

49:43.987 --> 49:45.390
People use these...

49:45.893 --> 49:50.420
We have house researchers in all the time, building researchers, people doing environmental impact statements.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.241
They come in to you.

49:51.301 --> 49:52.022
I wrote a picture of this.

49:52.042 --> 49:53.424
It says Ken Carpenter at Harvard.

49:53.444 --> 49:54.626
I love the smell myself.

49:54.726 --> 49:57.410
We're going through Widener, and I said, ah, I love that.

49:57.430 --> 50:00.455
But unfortunately, it's the smell of decaying books.

50:00.535 --> 50:04.621
You're going to try and capture the smell on camera?

50:05.502 --> 50:06.644
That's a great picture.

50:06.664 --> 50:08.166
I just love all the spines.

50:09.748 --> 50:10.069
Yeah.

50:10.309 --> 50:11.711
And we, wow, clean.

50:11.731 --> 50:13.975
We got, I can't tell you how.

50:13.995 --> 50:15.136
We made a movie real time.

50:15.497 --> 50:15.597
Yeah.

50:15.897 --> 50:16.859
In the mood.

50:16.879 --> 50:17.820
It was a nightmare.

50:19.643 --> 50:21.746
I think I spent a year moving.

50:21.766 --> 50:25.452
I've only been here two years, and a year of it was a nightmare.

50:25.913 --> 50:28.917
So you actually came in, you worked in the Old Main.

50:29.358 --> 50:30.019
For six months.

50:30.139 --> 50:30.880
For six months.

50:30.941 --> 50:31.682
And we closed.

50:31.702 --> 50:32.443
And then you were here.

50:32.503 --> 50:36.089
What was it like to be here while all that stuff was going on?

50:36.409 --> 50:38.452
In the Old Main?

50:38.512 --> 50:42.799
When the story broke about the books being... It was...

50:44.028 --> 50:45.671
And I won't quote you directly on this.

50:45.971 --> 50:48.315
I won't attribute it to you, but I'm just curious.

50:48.335 --> 50:52.822
I think it was just confusing because no one really knew what was going on.

50:53.102 --> 50:54.664
I mean, I didn't know.

50:54.805 --> 50:55.426
I wasn't here.

50:55.466 --> 51:00.293
I guess the weeding had started even earlier, after the 89 earthquake, and then weeding before the move.

51:00.313 --> 51:04.660
We don't weed in our collection, so I kind of was learning a new job.

51:04.860 --> 51:08.966
I wasn't paying attention to what was happening on other floors, and so I was just surprised.

51:09.347 --> 51:10.429
You were shocked?

51:10.529 --> 51:10.609
Yes.

51:11.585 --> 51:12.527
I wasn't shocked.

51:12.608 --> 51:13.550
I don't know what happened.

51:13.670 --> 51:18.864
I know there's normal weeding that wasn't done for many years that people needed to do.

51:18.924 --> 51:20.728
And I don't know what was over weeded.

51:20.989 --> 51:21.711
Do you know what I'm saying?

51:21.851 --> 51:22.894
It's very hard for me.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.450
But there's no list of things that went off.

51:25.690 --> 51:28.754
No, although I did walk down and look at Adopt-a-Book and books that were put out.

51:29.034 --> 51:29.695
Oh, I agree.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.817
You know, stuff that needed to be weeded.

51:32.198 --> 51:33.199
I saw some stuff.

51:33.219 --> 51:35.922
If someone shows you a book, it doesn't mean we don't have it at all.

51:35.942 --> 51:42.909
Okay, but I think fully 8% of the, now this is worthwhile, are last copies in the system.

51:42.969 --> 51:48.135
So that's, and Nick Baker has a list of 19,000 last books in the system.

51:48.435 --> 51:52.560
Yeah, you know, if there's a book on, some last copies aren't worth keeping.

51:53.300 --> 51:54.101
Probably so.

51:54.302 --> 51:56.525
You know, they're not literature.

51:56.585 --> 52:01.053
They're not, you know, I care for the 1970s.

52:01.093 --> 52:03.016
That's quite a statement to make.

52:03.477 --> 52:06.582
Well, and I'm a person who cares about old things in history.

52:07.844 --> 52:14.576
But anyway, you don't keep one copy of every book just because it was published.

52:14.876 --> 52:14.976
L.C.

52:15.177 --> 52:15.477
doesn't either.

52:16.958 --> 52:17.940
I don't know what happened.

52:18.040 --> 52:18.761
I was surprised.

52:18.881 --> 52:25.654
And also the lack of space was surprising as we started filling the library and it only became apparent as we started moving that stuff wasn't going to fit.

52:26.355 --> 52:28.358
That was kind of surprising.

52:28.378 --> 52:30.162
Made people anxious to say the least.

52:30.222 --> 52:30.763
Yeah.

52:30.783 --> 52:35.932
And we realized in our department, like you have to remember, none of this was moved in the initial move.

52:36.032 --> 52:37.455
It was all left in the old building.

52:37.535 --> 52:39.338
This was only moved this past April.

52:39.858 --> 52:40.899
Which stuff?

52:41.520 --> 52:46.386
All the SF history, all the morgue, all these shelves, all these deeds.

52:46.707 --> 52:49.911
We used to go to the old building for a year to page this stuff.

52:50.291 --> 52:52.754
No one had planned for this stuff to come to this building.

52:54.276 --> 52:55.317
So what were they going to do with it?

52:55.337 --> 52:56.379
I have no idea.

52:56.399 --> 52:57.500
I mean, I don't know.

52:59.503 --> 52:59.983
I don't know.

53:00.163 --> 53:04.409
I don't know if they thought it would fit or they thought we wouldn't really need it and we would give it up when the time came.

53:04.689 --> 53:05.410
I don't know.

53:05.693 --> 53:08.096
And I wasn't here, so you need to ask other people.

53:08.117 --> 53:13.164
But I know people in the department will say, they told them and they told them and they told them.

53:13.184 --> 53:16.529
And I didn't believe them, you know.

53:16.549 --> 53:18.492
So... This is good.

53:18.792 --> 53:19.653
Thank you.

53:19.673 --> 53:19.853
Yeah.

53:20.875 --> 53:22.157
And I'll take you upstairs.

53:22.177 --> 53:24.680
I'm going to take you where the game I've seen some of our collections are.

53:25.301 --> 53:27.204
And some of our other collections.

53:27.224 --> 53:27.505
Great.

53:29.327 --> 53:31.971
So...

53:34.702 --> 53:36.104
That was Brooks Hall.

53:50.065 --> 53:51.287
Okay.

53:51.307 --> 53:55.073
I fill up so many of these.

53:55.113 --> 53:57.116
This is the record.

53:57.136 --> 54:01.242
This hall used to be the one I read with.

54:01.823 --> 54:03.325
There was no other place for them.

54:03.777 --> 54:04.358
The whole hall.

54:04.438 --> 54:05.419
In this hall, yeah.

54:05.940 --> 54:14.049
So with the hiring of new staff, you think it's kind of calmed down a little bit?

54:14.069 --> 54:14.330
Oh, yeah.

54:14.350 --> 54:18.475
It's a huge difference in labor.

54:18.495 --> 54:18.755
Yeah.

54:18.775 --> 54:21.578
She said, yeah, 25 or 40 or something like that.

54:21.598 --> 54:23.521
So you can see it.

54:23.861 --> 54:29.808
Yeah, actually, they're going to go to 40.

54:29.828 --> 54:30.449
Oh, no, it makes a difference.

54:30.469 --> 54:30.929
It's a huge difference.

54:30.949 --> 54:33.092
With the back of the auditorium downstairs, you know, in the department, you can get it.

54:33.916 --> 54:53.102
I mean, they have some amazing things in art and music.

54:53.122 --> 54:57.468
They really have an incredible collection that has wonderful things like that.

54:57.488 --> 54:59.771
Those are souvenir programs from 1909.

55:00.132 --> 55:03.096
It was really kind of a manuscript thing.

55:04.612 --> 55:09.339
And then this is all San Francisco history over here.

55:09.359 --> 55:12.303
You've got a lot of responsibility.

55:15.608 --> 55:15.868
Mm-hmm.

55:15.948 --> 55:16.970
You like it?

55:17.891 --> 55:19.914
Yeah, we're very short-staffed.

55:21.256 --> 55:22.077
But you're happy here?

55:22.437 --> 55:27.445
Well, I spend about four hours a day on the reference desk, which is not what I thought when I came here.

55:27.825 --> 55:31.731
But yeah, we just... But you're in San Francisco, which is nice.

55:31.751 --> 55:32.312
No, it's great.

55:32.372 --> 55:33.353
And it's a great...

55:33.839 --> 55:35.642
It has a lot of potential.

55:37.184 --> 55:39.768
Well, that's a very hopeful statement, isn't it?

55:39.908 --> 55:41.551
Yeah, it does.

55:41.571 --> 55:47.620
It is.

55:49.463 --> 55:55.792
This is, uh, see this part area.

55:56.053 --> 55:56.133
Kim?

55:56.994 --> 55:58.657
Since the game has been in our office.

55:58.677 --> 55:58.817
Uh-huh.

56:01.430 --> 56:04.273
Now, in archives, do you need big tables to work on?

56:04.313 --> 56:08.338
Because that's how you do a collection, but more work is designed to go into this new building.

56:08.358 --> 56:10.941
So we kind of raised... What was not designed then?

56:11.722 --> 56:14.686
A space to do a collection.

56:14.706 --> 56:15.747
Yeah, we have fun about archives.

56:15.767 --> 56:18.510
I wasn't here when the building was planned.

56:18.530 --> 56:21.594
So how things you need to work on collections really slot into the building.

56:22.094 --> 56:23.756
I mean, again, it was a public library.

56:23.776 --> 56:30.324
I think nobody really... So like, hi.

56:31.005 --> 56:31.065
Hi.

56:31.585 --> 56:45.195
So this is your makeshift?

56:45.475 --> 56:46.618
Yeah, and back here.

56:47.560 --> 56:51.649
And these are?

56:51.669 --> 56:51.769
Yeah.

56:51.789 --> 56:51.889
Okay.

56:52.510 --> 56:57.897
So these are, this is part of the gay lesbian collections?

56:58.979 --> 56:59.960
Yeah.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.704
And the collections are here, not upstairs in that.

57:04.086 --> 57:09.733
Well, the archival collections are here.

57:09.753 --> 57:13.979
And right against the back wall are the gay and lesbian novels.

57:14.820 --> 57:15.220
Over here.

57:15.481 --> 57:18.785
Things that are a little more fragile are down here.

57:19.947 --> 57:20.087
Uh-huh.

57:25.535 --> 57:26.997
Yeah, I'm going to shoot a picture of that.

57:27.017 --> 57:27.858
That's interesting.

57:27.878 --> 57:45.759
That's very important.

57:45.779 --> 57:49.724
We've gotten a lot of Jane Austen collections.

57:49.744 --> 57:54.850
Would you say it's a research step?

57:54.870 --> 57:54.950
Yes.

57:54.970 --> 57:55.491
And it was intended to be.

57:56.838 --> 58:02.745
And Tim was hired, we needed to hire a separate archivist to work on these if they were ever going to see the light of day.

58:02.925 --> 58:04.107
Tim, what's your name?

58:04.127 --> 58:06.029
Tim Wilson.

58:06.530 --> 58:07.932
Tim Wilson.

58:07.952 --> 58:08.532
Tim Wilson.

58:08.552 --> 58:09.674
That's hard.

58:09.974 --> 58:14.600
Well, Tim was first hired for nine months, and then it was extended to two years.

58:14.860 --> 58:21.368
Although if we really want these collections to be made available to the public, they'll have to be a permanent position because... Sure.

58:21.528 --> 58:22.930
Well, are you cataloging things?

58:23.517 --> 58:39.452
Well, we call it processing, but it's basically going through box by box and arranging things or figuring out how they were arranged.

58:39.472 --> 58:40.574
These are his archives.

58:41.735 --> 58:43.757
These are his public documents.

58:44.097 --> 58:50.523
They don't necessarily relate to the fact that... Is it a gay, lesbian archive?

58:50.543 --> 58:51.364
I don't understand.

58:51.682 --> 58:53.124
I know who Harvey Milk is.

58:53.224 --> 58:55.147
I'm just wondering if these are his public papers.

58:55.868 --> 58:56.388
And private.

58:56.569 --> 58:58.792
These are public and private.

58:58.812 --> 59:02.256
So they are pertinent to the overall scheme of the collection.

59:02.276 --> 59:05.080
They could have been just part of the San Francisco history chapter.

59:05.100 --> 59:06.822
Do you know what I mean?

59:07.343 --> 59:07.964
Yeah, I do.

59:08.164 --> 59:15.454
And a lot of our damn lesbian collections happen to overlap because San Francisco has such a full gay life and we're collecting in the area.

59:15.875 --> 59:19.900
A lot of them could have come under the auspices of San Francisco history.

59:20.690 --> 59:21.311
Which is great.

59:21.451 --> 59:22.413
Randy Schultz's paper.

59:22.433 --> 59:22.553
Yep.

59:23.475 --> 59:27.021
But they happened to be in the gay and lesbian book because it was set up to be a separate book.

59:27.042 --> 59:32.852
Well, of course, his book would be totally pertinent to the research materials for his book.

59:33.774 --> 59:35.096
But it could be either still.

59:35.116 --> 59:36.378
I mean, I would still want to collect it.

59:36.398 --> 59:41.327
That, to me, would be a very important archive.

59:41.367 --> 59:44.233
That's the kind of thing you'd travel to San Francisco to research with you.

59:44.353 --> 59:44.453
Yeah.

59:44.872 --> 59:48.916
So we get a lot of international researchers, national and international, on these collections.

59:48.936 --> 59:52.460
What kinds of things drop people to your collection that they can't find elsewhere?

59:53.681 --> 01:00:05.314
Well, at this point, where we are, that are open, are some of the collections from which we have on deposit from the Indian Ocean Historical Society.

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:12.101
And one of the most popular of those collections is the Lou Sullivan paper.

01:00:12.221 --> 01:00:12.882
Lou Sullivan?

01:00:12.902 --> 01:00:13.082
L-O-U?

01:00:13.122 --> 01:00:13.242
L-O-U.

01:00:13.998 --> 01:00:14.688
Uh-huh.

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.330
Falling hard too.
