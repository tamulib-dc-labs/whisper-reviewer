WEBVTT

00:07.861 --> 00:11.907
Oh, that's fine.

00:22.584 --> 00:32.499
On bells, he probably did.

00:32.519 --> 00:35.944
No, no, but you certainly couldn't call us back on a stirrup.

00:36.025 --> 00:51.505
Okay, that's a good little story, because I think it does illustrate that book collection can be insignificant, you know?

00:51.525 --> 00:58.053
Okay, as we speak, I'm trying to get in touch with John Larket's press agent out there.

00:58.073 --> 01:01.898
I understand he's quite a major player in everything today.

01:02.502 --> 01:02.983
Is that right?

01:03.303 --> 01:08.593
And Jay Leno's, Jay Leno's wife, as I understand.

01:08.613 --> 01:15.645
Does that sound right?

01:15.665 --> 01:16.025
Yeah.

01:16.045 --> 01:16.146
Yeah.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.167
He collects books, too?

01:17.227 --> 01:20.633
I thought he's got a few other things about books.

01:20.653 --> 01:22.016
He's kidding me.

01:22.036 --> 01:25.101
Now, do I have to go through a press agent to get in touch with him, do you think?

01:33.029 --> 01:41.238
So you might say that he and his wife selected a couple, is that?

01:41.258 --> 01:42.700
Really?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.904
Well, I should write to him directly here.

01:45.924 --> 01:52.171
Why do you check like this?

01:52.191 --> 02:01.361
Well, there was a piece in USA Today a while back, and it did indicate that he is interested in cars by his wife.

02:01.381 --> 02:02.142
My book is kind of our obsession, too.

02:02.493 --> 02:07.177
Biblio mania, you know.

02:07.458 --> 02:13.203
It's going to be good, trust me.

02:13.904 --> 02:18.288
Are you familiar with the garden sale here?

02:18.308 --> 02:18.768
Remember Haven O'Moore?

02:18.788 --> 02:22.272
That was a big... Oh, yeah.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.773
Well, that's going to be a great chapter, right?

02:23.793 --> 02:24.654
That's a great story.

02:24.674 --> 02:28.117
I've been to Texas and I do a chapter on the University of Texas.

02:28.137 --> 02:29.458
Harry Ransom, Luke Feldman, and that all.

02:29.478 --> 02:30.599
And that's going to be great.

02:30.619 --> 02:31.200
Of course, that is wonderful.

02:31.349 --> 02:58.048
Did you find that out there?

02:58.754 --> 03:00.817
I saw that in Britain.

03:00.837 --> 03:03.380
You know, they had the British Railway Pension Fund.

03:03.400 --> 03:09.528
They sold a guy there, I guess, three odd million dollars just several months ago.

03:09.548 --> 03:14.655
And their investment in that was like $165,000 ten years ago.

03:14.675 --> 03:24.607
That's a pretty good return on investment, isn't it?

03:24.627 --> 03:24.708
Wow.

03:24.728 --> 03:25.048
Really.

03:26.868 --> 03:30.472
Well, you need good advice on what to buy.

03:31.453 --> 03:35.797
You can buy a lot of shit, too, if you'll excuse my Greek.

03:35.817 --> 03:42.063
Have you been to any of these sales, or have you brothers come to these?

03:47.369 --> 03:49.110
I've been to all the Bradley Martins.

03:49.310 --> 03:56.137
Mr. Heck, Priscilla, Priscilla G. Bellis gave me a number three.

03:56.157 --> 03:56.858
I had lunch with Barnard last week.

03:58.103 --> 04:25.888
Well, it's—I'm really into American fiction in the 20th century, but I love 19th century illustrated books.

04:25.908 --> 04:28.110
And now I'm really—since I've started this book, I have particularly on catalogs, just to support my research.

04:28.293 --> 04:40.666
But I put together a very nice collection of books.

04:40.786 --> 04:46.952
I have a chapter that's going to start with maybe the whole sale of 1911.

04:46.972 --> 04:49.414
That's going to be my golden age chapter.

04:49.434 --> 04:50.676
That will conclude with the current sale of 1929.

04:50.696 --> 04:53.018
But when you have that whole sale, you bring in Henry Huntington, you bring in the Lord, and you bring in Rosenberg.

04:53.403 --> 05:13.693
And I'm getting a lot of contemporary stuff and the letters that I've been talking to before and getting to the back of the criminal home theater.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.816
So Jovenius McCacken, because I need women, you know, this is why I need Jay Leno, is why I need you too.

05:15.836 --> 05:17.318
After Rickard, do you have some idea how I can get in touch with Jay Leno?

05:17.888 --> 05:41.454
Okay, but where would I write it?

05:41.474 --> 05:41.875
Is it in the studio?

05:41.895 --> 05:42.976
Well, either way, now he's kind of a neighbor of mine.

05:42.996 --> 05:43.597
He's from North Andover, Mass.

05:43.617 --> 05:44.638
I grew up in Lowell, which is about six miles away.

05:48.972 --> 05:58.364
Uh, maybe I could run a few of those names by.

05:58.384 --> 05:58.905
Security.

06:04.432 --> 06:13.764
Well, I mean, I've heard that David Lloyd is a big, pretty big color collector.

06:13.784 --> 06:16.768
He's a major collector, and Bronson Pinchard is a pretty... Yeah, well, you mean Actors Collective?

06:26.519 --> 06:27.901
No kidding.

06:27.921 --> 06:40.035
Are they good collections?

06:40.055 --> 06:44.741
Who might that be?

06:44.761 --> 06:48.406
We got to have lunch maybe, huh?

06:48.426 --> 06:53.792
Well, not even use his name to see if he wants to talk to me.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.065
which would be wonderful.

06:57.085 --> 07:08.705
And the point is, I have to convince people that I'm doing it.

07:08.725 --> 07:16.098
All I have to do is I have to drop the names of the people I've got.

07:16.118 --> 07:16.719
I don't know, I understand it.

07:16.739 --> 07:17.841
It's just my mother and the free puts put by asking me.

07:17.861 --> 07:18.582
I don't expect you to tell me.

07:19.118 --> 07:21.822
Okay, so are you guys going to be around?

07:22.102 --> 07:23.725
It's just a question of nailing down.

07:23.745 --> 07:35.122
I beg your pardon?

07:37.145 --> 07:42.753
Why is that?

07:42.773 --> 07:44.856
I'd like to talk to you, and I'd also like to talk to Lou.

07:44.936 --> 07:47.320
Isn't Lou also a past president of the VAA?

07:48.008 --> 07:50.492
Okay, so he should be, I should talk to him.

07:50.552 --> 07:59.909
I really want to get a very strong California-looking vacation here.

07:59.929 --> 08:07.382
See, now I've got to talk to him.

08:07.402 --> 08:13.172
Do you think he's going to be around at the end of the month, early, at the end of July or early August?

08:18.147 --> 08:29.582
Okay, and so if there are no major fears, he will be lying.

08:30.864 --> 08:31.264
Yeah.

08:31.865 --> 08:34.188
So this is the screenwriter who lives in New England, right?

08:34.208 --> 08:40.436
I'd better take a little bit of digging so I can find out who it is.

08:42.839 --> 08:42.980
Okay.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.762
Is he a nice guy?

08:45.721 --> 08:59.801
Okay, you've got my name.

08:59.821 --> 09:01.323
Do you want me to send you, what's your address?

09:01.363 --> 09:05.169
I will send you some stuff.

09:05.229 --> 09:05.589
8-4-5-0.

09:07.352 --> 09:09.495
That's a California address.

09:09.515 --> 09:10.316
8-5-4-0.

09:10.336 --> 09:14.622
Melrose.

09:14.642 --> 09:14.682
9-

09:17.075 --> 09:18.518
Okay.

09:18.778 --> 09:23.807
I'll say a few things that I've done.

09:23.827 --> 09:25.951
Believe me, it's going to be a good book.

09:25.971 --> 09:28.034
It's going to be the book for the 90s on the subject.

09:28.054 --> 09:31.961
People are very happy to be part of it.

09:31.981 --> 09:35.608
By the way, it's not a collection of little biographies.

09:35.628 --> 09:40.416
These are going to be chapters with stories, and there's a focus on the truth.

09:42.657 --> 09:47.004
We're telling stories.

09:52.692 --> 10:00.704
We're telling very interesting stories.

10:00.724 --> 10:01.706
I don't know how to do it, but it did well.

10:02.126 --> 10:04.530
The thing about this is that I've already sold the paper to Activision.

10:05.202 --> 10:16.369
I was also on the strength of a proposal, and I explained what I was doing.

10:16.389 --> 10:18.754
So they definitely do see the commercial and the popular appeal.

10:18.774 --> 10:19.396
But I did have to sell them on.

10:19.416 --> 10:20.558
People don't think the collection is popular.

10:20.579 --> 10:21.220
They're ridiculous.

10:27.562 --> 10:29.284
I think people would be surprised.

10:29.445 --> 10:38.236
I was talking to Jack Myles of the L.A.

10:38.256 --> 10:38.597
Times Book Group.

10:38.617 --> 10:40.359
I write to the book collection.

10:40.379 --> 10:41.741
He said, would you send them to me?

10:41.761 --> 10:43.063
He said, we got a fair and thousands of people showed up.

10:43.083 --> 10:43.423
He was surprised.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.064
I said, the L.A.

10:44.084 --> 10:49.992
Fair is one of the most successful in the world.

10:58.595 --> 11:05.923
and quality.

11:05.983 --> 11:06.644
Okay, sir.

11:07.645 --> 11:08.846
I appreciate the time.

11:08.907 --> 11:17.236
And so I'll drop you a note and then I'll call you, like, how much time in advance do you think we need to set?

11:17.276 --> 11:26.767
Okay, well, I'm going to just try to set up my line-up here of interviews, and I will be wanting to get to San Francisco at the end, probably coming in from Chicago.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.167
It's a great thing.

11:27.822 --> 11:31.588
No, I'm in Massachusetts.

11:31.608 --> 11:40.120
Yeah, I know where you called him, Massachusetts.

11:40.140 --> 11:45.989
Well, I've been going to New York, it seems like.

11:46.009 --> 11:46.289
Who is that?

11:46.770 --> 11:48.532
Okay, so now I know who your brother is.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.378
He's the other fellow that was with Jim and the other fellow from England.

11:52.699 --> 11:55.062
They're kind of three of them who work together.

11:55.818 --> 12:00.871
Well, Jim, please, when you talk to Jim, ask him about me.

12:00.891 --> 12:11.537
Jim knows me, and I've already interviewed Dick Manny for this, because he doesn't care what's going on.

12:11.557 --> 12:13.422
Dick's coming out of it, and he's been talking for the first time about his collection to me.

12:14.313 --> 12:31.774
I talked to Bill Scheide, the first private owner of his collection, arguably the finest in the world.

12:31.794 --> 12:32.676
Are my brethren pretty good names here?

12:51.623 --> 13:15.217
Well, I really need a representation.

13:15.237 --> 13:15.758
I really covered the East.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.240
I'm going through Chicago, Orlando, and I'm going to see Blacksville, St.

13:17.260 --> 13:17.480
Louisville.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.403
And if you think of somebody who didn't last like the stock here for instance, like what state?

13:19.737 --> 13:24.483
Okay, no problem.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.926
Just curious because I will be going around.

13:26.946 --> 13:28.048
Thank you, sir.

13:28.068 --> 13:32.153
We'll be in touch.

13:32.173 --> 13:32.253
Bye.

13:32.273 --> 13:33.294
Hey, George Shills.

13:33.895 --> 13:35.217
Get good guys, let him do it.

13:35.617 --> 13:36.659
Guys check back with him.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.604
That's the style he wants and is successful at it.

13:40.624 --> 13:42.606
Does the buck stop with you?

13:43.888 --> 13:45.891
He accepts the responsibility.

13:45.951 --> 13:46.251
Sure.

13:46.551 --> 13:47.753
I mean, Quig actually said,

13:48.172 --> 13:53.079
buck stopped with me in this, well, uh, meaning that Pointhexter never told him.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.683
Pointhexter should have told him.

13:55.703 --> 14:02.773
Uh, it's a hell of a guy, and this is why I, I, uh, am, uh, down on John Pointhexter right now.

14:02.793 --> 14:09.322
I like John as a man, I think he's a wonderful guy, a brilliant guy, first in class at Annapolis, Ph.D.

14:09.362 --> 14:16.052
in atomic physics, uh, a brilliant man, but let the president down by not confessing to an error.

14:16.977 --> 14:20.442
I like that scene when he's eating his ham and eggs.

14:20.902 --> 14:21.703
That's John.

14:21.844 --> 14:23.606
He's unflappable.

14:23.626 --> 14:25.528
You never see a smile like you're smiling.

14:26.069 --> 14:26.750
Relax that way.

14:26.770 --> 14:27.751
That's not John.

14:27.791 --> 14:28.993
John's very persistent.

14:29.013 --> 14:30.395
He sits this way, the glasses on.

14:31.216 --> 14:32.237
That's John.

14:32.257 --> 14:34.661
Have you ever, I'm going to go off the track a little bit.

14:34.701 --> 14:35.522
Go ahead.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.965
Cambridge kid, drivers are caught.

14:40.128 --> 14:45.415
You grew up in a town where there's importance of being caught.

14:46.677 --> 14:52.102
You went one way, and a guy who you don't seem to have that much respect for, Tip O'Neill went in an entirely different way.

14:52.342 --> 15:05.434
Two kids, Irish background, same town, one becomes a symbol of the Republican ethic or whatever, and the other guy goes, if anything can explain that.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.055
I mean, you voted for Wendell Wilkie.

15:07.095 --> 15:11.900
Well, as I keep needling Tip, you'll hear me say this over and over again.

15:11.920 --> 15:12.720
It's interesting.

15:12.821 --> 15:16.684
I just used with Tip, we were on a forum down in Florida the other day,

15:17.069 --> 15:26.482
And I told the audience, I said, this is what I've told Tip ever since I ran into McGinnon when we were both in Washington.

15:26.502 --> 15:29.426
Tip, the trouble with you is you went to Boston College and turned left.

15:30.087 --> 15:31.849
I went to Harvard and turned right.

15:31.949 --> 15:33.872
I mean, it was possible.

15:34.132 --> 15:35.254
No, I'm an entrepreneur.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.437
Remember, I tell the story in the book.

15:37.457 --> 15:46.249
Before I was 21 years old, I had my own business and had eight guys working for me as guides, tourist guides in and around Harvard.

15:46.752 --> 15:49.515
But that might be it.

15:49.535 --> 15:50.836
Do you think it's a Harvard B.C.

15:50.856 --> 15:51.057
thing?

15:51.757 --> 15:59.225
No, I think it's more, my nature is being entrepreneurial, and Tip has been a politician all his life.

15:59.245 --> 16:07.514
He's a politician in Cambridge Latin, getting elected to various offices and classes there, working for politicians through his father.

16:07.854 --> 16:09.055
He tells that in his book.

16:09.896 --> 16:12.499
What do you think of his book, by the way?

16:12.519 --> 16:14.141
Ghostbusters.

16:14.161 --> 16:15.402
Not his book.

16:15.422 --> 16:16.303
It's too anecdotal.

16:16.688 --> 16:44.147
doesn't go into the issues uh it's immensely entertaining yeah entertaining but i mean it's uh it's he seldom gets into the the issues i'm more issue oriented than tip is but he's the he's the supreme politician he's rounded he's smooth in that uh you know he uses sam raven's technique go along to get along i'm not that type i need it head on

16:44.583 --> 16:45.725
I have to give him credit, though.

16:45.785 --> 16:47.508
I interviewed him in our cobalt.

16:47.528 --> 16:51.975
And he said, I mean, you can certainly say it's a local thing, but he really kicked Tukakis.

16:54.399 --> 16:55.440
But I nailed him on this.

16:55.521 --> 16:57.564
I said to him, Tim, who's responsible?

16:57.864 --> 17:03.013
I said, didn't Massachusetts benefit from an awful lot of defense work, like GE and Lynn?

17:03.033 --> 17:04.134
Just the swornin' GEs.

17:05.096 --> 17:06.098
Right, and all of that.

17:06.158 --> 17:08.582
He said, yeah, I said, who got those contracts, Tukakis?

17:09.163 --> 17:10.725
Or was that Kennedy and O'Neill?

17:12.578 --> 17:15.020
And he said, well, the Speaker does have some prerogatives.

17:15.121 --> 17:22.608
I said, yeah, especially after he knocks the hell out of the defense budget that Reagan sends over and then gets his share for Massachusetts.

17:22.628 --> 17:24.610
I'm going to go back, but anyway, back to the record.

17:25.291 --> 17:27.973
I would say it's just a difference in nature.

17:27.993 --> 17:35.761
And most people would think going to Harvard would have turned one left in that day.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.523
Remember, those were all of...

17:37.840 --> 17:42.286
The time I went there, these were... There weren't any Irish kids at Harvard.

17:42.326 --> 17:47.333
Those were Roosevelt's advices at Harvard that were teaching me.

17:49.756 --> 17:50.858
Interesting.

17:50.878 --> 17:51.318
Good point.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.882
I'm going to go back and ask you again.

17:54.623 --> 17:57.927
But it's that entrepreneurial flavor, I think.

17:57.947 --> 17:59.790
Okay, if it still hurts, I miss that.

18:00.551 --> 18:02.433
If it still hurts, I say no.

18:03.054 --> 18:04.757
Now it's more in sorrow than anger.

18:05.658 --> 18:07.240
Of course I would have liked to have had

18:07.658 --> 18:09.280
the ending smoother.

18:09.701 --> 18:20.438
I would have liked the idea of not going out with banners and flags and bands, but at least the traditional picture, firm handshake, nice letter, and away you go.

18:20.478 --> 18:21.419
You didn't even like the letter.

18:21.439 --> 18:26.507
You said you saw thousands of these and somebody else had written it.

18:26.667 --> 18:35.100
From my point of view, I think that a little warmer stuff maybe regards to my wife, something like that would have been a little more appropriate.

18:35.198 --> 18:40.103
Does he, I get the sense that he really doesn't, well, you even say it straight out.

18:40.664 --> 18:45.269
He says to Bush, why doesn't he have the courage?

18:45.309 --> 18:46.650
The man is soft-hearted.

18:46.710 --> 18:53.838
He cannot face a person and say to that person, be it male or female, I'm sorry.

18:54.278 --> 18:55.499
The thing isn't working out.

18:56.641 --> 18:58.983
We're going the wrong way here.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.406
We've got to break this off.

19:01.646 --> 19:02.607
What would you like to do?

19:06.788 --> 19:07.289
in my life.

19:07.669 --> 19:08.651
Most other people do.

19:08.671 --> 19:14.018
I don't think anybody likes to fire people, and you like to get it over as quickly as possible.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.622
Well, that's his decision.

19:16.702 --> 19:18.144
I don't know enough about this.

19:18.785 --> 19:25.995
He's had a couple of bad experiences, but go back to Ray Donovan.

19:26.015 --> 19:29.060
He kept Donovan on until Donovan was indicted.

19:29.781 --> 19:31.363
Then Donovan did the right thing.

19:31.723 --> 19:33.606
Being indicted, he resigned.

19:34.379 --> 19:37.924
talked to the president about it and said, you know, when I clear my skirts, I'll be back.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.610
Well, it took Donovan three years to get cleared.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.775
Remember his plaintive words, and now where do I go for my reputation?

19:45.837 --> 19:46.738
But he was cleared.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.504
I dare say that he's guiding on that with Mies.

19:50.624 --> 19:55.171
Mies has not ever been charged with a crime, let alone been invited.

19:55.391 --> 19:56.313
It's perception.

19:56.373 --> 19:57.615
It's perception.

19:57.795 --> 20:03.103
And the president's apparently willing to put up with that because he saw in the perceptions of me

20:03.590 --> 20:04.792
that the press was wrong.

20:05.533 --> 20:18.295
I had nothing to do with the Iran-Contra affair, but yet Newsweek magazine had my picture on the cover with who knew, and then later his picture with cover-up, and there was the fact that the chief of staff ordered a cover-up.

20:20.118 --> 20:24.265
Blatantly false doubt, as proven by Senate committee's Lawrence Walter.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.267
So you do feel vindicated?

20:26.128 --> 20:26.789
Oh, sure.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.332
Definitely.

20:28.632 --> 20:33.137
Well, remember, I had a love feast with Congress, by the way, for a guy who couldn't get along with Congress.

20:33.157 --> 20:34.919
They say that in the book, yeah, that's cute.

20:34.939 --> 20:44.630
I mean, that, sure, I've been vindicated, but I think the president, again, doesn't want to, just for appearances, throw somebody over.

20:44.650 --> 20:46.753
And I think that's his problem at this point.

20:46.773 --> 20:49.776
Well, it's... I think Nietzsche is waiting for the McKay Report.

20:50.157 --> 20:54.562
How do you feel that, now we have your book, I mean, the Democrats must be loving this.

20:54.622 --> 20:56.143
I mean, they don't have to say a word.

20:56.163 --> 20:57.525
They can't Larry Speaks in...

20:57.978 --> 21:01.642
I was a public affairs officer in the Navy.

21:01.823 --> 21:04.926
I used to write things for my admirals and my captains.

21:04.946 --> 21:06.728
But I always ran it by them.

21:07.369 --> 21:09.872
You just added the right clause.

21:09.912 --> 21:11.234
You have to run it by them.

21:11.294 --> 21:22.307
There isn't a public relations person in the world who doesn't put words in the mouth of the principal or correct what the principal has said.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.769
Check back.

21:25.190 --> 21:26.491
That was Speaks' thing.

21:26.511 --> 21:27.833
And even if Speaks had done it,

21:29.078 --> 21:32.041
without reference to the president because of time or whatever.

21:32.342 --> 21:36.766
He should have gone up to the president and said, look, I put some words in your mouth.

21:36.826 --> 21:39.409
If you want to retract, you know, I'll go out there and pull it.

21:41.011 --> 21:41.992
But he didn't do it.

21:42.012 --> 21:43.774
That was his mistake.

21:43.874 --> 21:44.835
And you know his other mistake?

21:45.115 --> 21:45.656
In saying it.

21:47.138 --> 21:49.480
That's unforgivable.

21:49.520 --> 21:57.769
I spent three years as one of these guys, and I mean, your job is you really do subordinate yourself to the man, and that extends

21:58.070 --> 22:05.757
You know, after the term was... Well, come back to the... But let's talk about how it's going to affect the... Come back to the Democrats.

22:05.917 --> 22:07.459
The Republican chances.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.563
From the point... My book, I can only speak for that.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.966
I don't know about Larry's book or Marty Anderson's book or any of these other books.

22:15.526 --> 22:24.735
My book, I think, that if a person reads it, they'll come back with a better appreciation of the Reagan-Bush record.

22:25.120 --> 22:28.184
And if Bush runs on Reagan's record, I think I've laid it out there.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.227
Look at what tax reform really has done.

22:30.247 --> 22:31.289
Yeah, look at the polls.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.892
They've actually gone down 20 points in the last week.

22:34.173 --> 22:36.576
Can you attribute any of this to that, do you think?

22:36.957 --> 22:37.918
No.

22:38.439 --> 22:39.080
I attribute this.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.902
Now, who's been on the front page?

22:40.922 --> 22:42.104
Get away from Boston Globe.

22:42.465 --> 22:49.495
Take New York Times or Chicago Tribune or something of that nature, because they covered the caucus extremely well even after them.

22:49.715 --> 22:50.776
Local boy makes good.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.722
From the point of view of the press,

22:54.989 --> 23:00.097
Tukakis, because of Jackson, has been on the front page.

23:00.577 --> 23:01.819
They're still head-to-head.

23:03.041 --> 23:03.822
Bush has won it.

23:04.303 --> 23:06.266
He won it six or eight weeks ago.

23:06.326 --> 23:07.287
He peaked too early.

23:07.568 --> 23:08.589
There's no contest.

23:08.609 --> 23:09.871
No contest, no coverage.

23:10.011 --> 23:13.276
There really isn't a contest on the Democratic race, you know, either.

23:13.336 --> 23:16.261
Well, but they have to because of the ethnic thing.

23:16.982 --> 23:20.808
And Jackson charging, hey, look, I'm not out of this race and you're not running me.

23:21.048 --> 23:22.670
How come you're favoring the white boy?

23:23.451 --> 23:23.832
Come on.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.806
Do you think the press has been easy on Jensen?

23:26.826 --> 23:27.107
Yes.

23:28.068 --> 23:29.310
Haven't challenged Jensen?

23:29.330 --> 23:31.473
Haven't challenged him as much as they challenged Gary Hart.

23:34.297 --> 23:35.238
I'm going to go back.

23:35.418 --> 23:38.322
I missed the first two words in the book, Nancy Reagan.

23:38.423 --> 23:45.252
You said that was a stylistic thing, more than the first two words in the book, Nancy Reagan.

23:45.673 --> 23:52.182
And you said that was stylistic more than... Stylistic more than...

23:53.191 --> 23:55.935
how I put it, Vendetta, or something of that nature.

23:56.336 --> 23:57.758
But he must feel a lot better though.

23:57.938 --> 23:59.340
No.

24:00.962 --> 24:09.235
Except, no in answer to the unsaid thought, perhaps, that I did this for Spite.

24:09.675 --> 24:11.017
No, I did not do it for Spite.

24:11.037 --> 24:13.220
But the LA Times has written on straws.

24:14.302 --> 24:15.664
Did you see the LA Times review?

24:15.984 --> 24:17.387
No, I heard about it.

24:17.407 --> 24:18.388
I just read it.

24:19.617 --> 24:20.758
Robert Shearer.

24:20.778 --> 24:21.539
Robert Shearer?

24:21.740 --> 24:22.260
I don't know.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.122
He works for the time.

24:23.142 --> 24:25.024
I don't know who he is, but I just read it.

24:25.104 --> 24:31.652
Well, in fact, each reviewer is... Scurrilous memoir, mean-spirited, pompous nonsense.

24:31.813 --> 24:36.619
Actually, it's a straight-out, in fact it says, in defense of Nancy Reagan.

24:36.639 --> 24:40.724
Well, I mean, he's a fan of Nancy Reagan, quite obviously.

24:41.866 --> 24:47.633
And in her hometown paper, that coming out, make her feel a lot better.

24:48.187 --> 24:52.712
From my point of view, I'm going to let the book speak for itself.

24:52.832 --> 24:55.154
I'll balance that with a Washington book review.

24:55.755 --> 25:00.920
There's a Washington writer, Jonathan Yardley.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.323
Well, thank you.

25:03.643 --> 25:07.167
Yardley says the same thing, and he's one of both surprises as a critic.

25:08.148 --> 25:12.612
And his last two words, I'll stand on those.

25:13.653 --> 25:17.077
His last sentence goes along this way, and I remember the last two words.

25:17.598 --> 25:18.058
He said,

25:18.697 --> 25:23.361
Regan has done something rare in Washington.

25:23.581 --> 25:26.684
He has written an honest book.

25:26.784 --> 25:27.485
I like it.

25:27.505 --> 25:28.466
I read it straight through.

25:28.486 --> 25:29.667
I didn't skip it, you know.

25:30.428 --> 25:33.610
I have to read all my books a week, you know.

25:33.650 --> 25:35.532
The book is the man.

25:35.592 --> 25:37.174
I've been traveling when I could do it.

25:37.274 --> 25:37.694
It's the man.

25:37.894 --> 25:38.675
I need to speak this book.

25:38.695 --> 25:40.116
It's a different time I can work.

25:40.136 --> 25:42.338
None of those books have anything.

25:42.358 --> 25:43.639
You can tell it can't work.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.442
I thought that those notes,

25:46.760 --> 25:50.764
And I like the fact that you could have done anything on the attempted assassination.

25:50.965 --> 25:54.488
There's a sense of immediacy there.

25:54.568 --> 26:00.955
I take copious notes, and I have in mind to write a book, my story, and there it is.

26:02.597 --> 26:04.059
I left my glasses downstairs.

26:04.079 --> 26:07.242
That's a hell of a thing.

26:09.645 --> 26:12.548
I have a pair of glasses.

26:12.697 --> 26:18.805
And we did say that one of the other questions, I didn't have my paper part of it right, but this is really one of my mystery questions.

26:18.825 --> 26:21.749
The reason for this book was to tell the Don Regan story.

26:21.769 --> 26:28.558
And let me just interject, it's not a case of, use Joe Kennedy's old words, good Irishman, don't get man yet even.

26:28.638 --> 26:29.800
No.

26:30.161 --> 26:36.589
Don Regan's story, but either tell the whole story or tell no story.

26:36.990 --> 26:42.417
And isn't it, it may be scurrilous in the eyes of that reviewer, but

26:43.426 --> 26:47.451
Isn't it funny that I'm getting taken to task for writing an honest book?

26:48.873 --> 27:00.048
And isn't it amazing that had I leaked this story to somebody, and a reporter talked about that, it would have been all right for me to leak something and give it to somebody else.

27:00.068 --> 27:07.358
But for me to come straight forward out and put my own name on it, not hide behind the well-known Washington leak,

27:08.063 --> 27:09.565
I'm a top dog.

27:09.705 --> 27:15.875
Well, like Dukakis got bagged for that fighting thing, which was a perfectly legitimate shot.

27:15.955 --> 27:18.319
I don't know why that poor Cecil had to quit.

27:18.339 --> 27:23.567
It's not like they fabricated, remember the guy, it was true.

27:23.627 --> 27:25.189
It was absolutely true.

27:25.389 --> 27:37.007
And I think it was a Republican who said, you know, when the day comes, when you try to criticize a man's record on the facts, then you'll notice that I don't use adjectives to describe people.

27:37.325 --> 27:38.366
I use their own words.

27:38.827 --> 27:40.288
Oh, interruption.

27:40.448 --> 27:45.213
Why do you not use quotation marks around the president's quotes and quotation marks?

27:45.233 --> 27:54.823
Well, I guess it's old fashioned, but I just couldn't bring myself to really quote the man directly unless I'd had a tape recorder every single word.

27:54.843 --> 27:56.264
But everybody else is going to quote it.

27:56.284 --> 28:03.872
I know, and most of that other stuff I have heard and I took notes of it, but call it quaint, call it novel,

28:04.274 --> 28:06.597
I just couldn't bring myself up.

28:06.617 --> 28:10.121
You also said this is the only person you have ever willingly subordinated yourself.

28:10.141 --> 28:10.401
True.

28:10.521 --> 28:11.462
Yeah, read your book.

28:11.482 --> 28:11.843
Very true.

28:12.543 --> 28:15.647
I'm very pleased and impressed.

28:16.468 --> 28:18.390
Do you blame the media for your troubles?

28:18.830 --> 28:19.051
No.

28:20.252 --> 28:21.514
You've had your run-ins with them.

28:21.614 --> 28:22.475
I've had my run-ins.

28:22.975 --> 28:27.981
What I'm trying to do in the book, obviously, is to correct some of the impressions that were left out there.

28:28.541 --> 28:31.665
As a matter of fact, I went over and saw the people at Newsweek last week.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.304
And I had a chat with some of those reporters, and they admit now, and I'll go, this is off the record.

28:36.324 --> 28:37.765
Okay, well, just shut it off if you'd like.

28:38.566 --> 28:40.327
Let me go off, put it off while you go off the record.

28:40.347 --> 28:43.170
I'll let you have the tape of this, but I mean, it is off the record.

28:44.111 --> 28:50.457
They told me that they were believing what McFarlane and North and so on were putting out at that time.

28:50.477 --> 28:59.965
And they were dumping on me, it's a classic disinformation campaign, in order to shift the blame and the spotlight away from them.

29:00.130 --> 29:01.352
And Newsweek was violent.

29:01.612 --> 29:04.517
And they were conned on it.

29:04.537 --> 29:05.178
And they were nice.

29:05.658 --> 29:06.439
It's not nice, no.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.401
That's what I told them.

29:08.042 --> 29:10.025
You know what they did, though?

29:10.165 --> 29:28.753
But after the damage was done, I mean... In the Washington... It's like charging a guy with, you know, child molestation on the front page and then putting an egg inside that he was... Well, the thing is, they have a blow-up of their covers in the hall of the Washington Bureau.

29:29.611 --> 29:35.758
And they actually presented that to me as a token of Mayor Cooper.

29:36.899 --> 29:38.381
Fast questions.

29:38.501 --> 29:39.402
Should Mies resign?

29:40.664 --> 29:42.726
I can't say because I don't know enough about the other side.

29:42.746 --> 29:44.788
How would you advise the president to do that?

29:44.808 --> 29:50.975
At this point, I would be having chats with Mies about doing the right thing, so to speak.

29:50.995 --> 29:54.900
Are North and Poindexter national heroes to use the president's name?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.241
I think North is a hero.

29:56.381 --> 29:57.863
Any guy that has a silver star,

29:58.349 --> 30:00.592
two purple hearts in all those campaign ribbons.

30:00.612 --> 30:01.273
He's a hero.

30:02.114 --> 30:12.650
I don't believe that if they are guilty of having diverted funds from the Congress, and this hasn't been proven yet in the court of law, but if they are guilty of that, that's not a heroic act.

30:12.670 --> 30:16.455
I just want to make sure my tape is still going.

30:16.635 --> 30:18.719
Should the president pardon these?

30:18.739 --> 30:20.301
I think it's too early in the process.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.746
Even the independent counsel is under attack.

30:23.766 --> 30:28.052
The whole idea of it, the Supreme Court rules on that probably in July, I mean in June.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.664
This case has to go.

30:30.684 --> 30:33.087
There are going to be many challenges to the whole procedure.

30:33.627 --> 30:42.237
Much too early in the procedure to, at this point, pardon these guys, because I think the American people might feel cheated of something.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.881
So, yeah, but the president will be out of office in seven months regardless.

30:45.901 --> 30:49.925
Well, I think that then the next president has to think through.

30:50.245 --> 30:52.808
Well, if it's New Clatters, I doubt if you're going to get a pardon.

30:53.142 --> 31:01.433
Well, I'm not sure, because he's going to have to take a very close look at what they did and why they did it.

31:01.453 --> 31:02.474
I'd be really surprised.

31:03.736 --> 31:10.224
Well, if they're found guilty, assuming they're found guilty, campaign close?

31:10.304 --> 31:11.125
It's going to be a trade race?

31:11.145 --> 31:11.986
Very, very close.

31:12.046 --> 31:19.015
With Bush as the challenger now, Dukakis as the front runner, a lot will depend now on who they select as vice president.

31:19.417 --> 31:22.821
There was a time when the vice president presidential candidate didn't mean that much.

31:23.141 --> 31:27.506
But a swing of five percentage points one way or the other will take this election.

31:28.026 --> 31:32.311
A vice president could bring five percentage points to the candidate.

31:32.591 --> 31:33.352
Or take it away.

31:34.273 --> 31:36.516
I'm just firing it up.

31:36.656 --> 31:39.559
Was Iran contra a threat to constitutional government?

31:42.763 --> 31:45.245
You don't really address that in the book.

31:45.265 --> 31:45.646
Yes.

31:45.906 --> 31:47.668
If...

31:48.121 --> 32:00.594
If allowed to continue, where people in the executive branch deliberately set off to fort the will of Congress, but the Bolan Amendment still is misunderstood and not known.

32:00.614 --> 32:10.364
There have been five versions of that Bolan Amendment, so whether or not any of five versions were a matter of law and violated still remains to be proven.

32:11.946 --> 32:12.807
Okay, it's five after.

32:13.408 --> 32:13.508
Okay.

32:13.528 --> 32:13.828
Thank you.

32:13.848 --> 32:14.729
Can you sign my books?

32:15.069 --> 32:15.630
Sure.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.897
You say that the proceeds of this are going to charity?

32:19.197 --> 32:24.005
All the proceeds of this, my part of the proceeds of this book are going to charity.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.871
I can't give away my agent's money, but my royalties are going to charity.

32:29.253 --> 32:32.838
Be in the medical and educational fields.

32:32.859 --> 32:36.424
But that's important, because the royalties will be writing conservative.

32:36.584 --> 32:40.851
Well, the other hand, I didn't want people to say I did this cashing in.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.073
Cashing in, the hell of it.
