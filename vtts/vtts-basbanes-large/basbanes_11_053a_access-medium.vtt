00:02.798 --> 00:04.601
Charles Goldsmith.

00:04.881 --> 00:17.519
The question is what are the gains and losses when a small private library goes out of existence?

00:17.539 --> 00:22.866
We're talking specifically about the Francis Bacon Foundation Library in Claremont.

00:22.846 --> 00:31.874
California's DLR perhaps altogether from, let's say, the 1920s and 30s up until about four or five years ago.

00:31.894 --> 00:33.700
It was a private library owned by

00:34.068 --> 00:37.632
Francis Bacon, excuse me, owned by Walter Conrad Ahrensberg.

00:37.793 --> 00:38.994
And who was he, by the way?

00:39.014 --> 00:45.442
He was a rich man, who believed that Shakespeare, I will regret, right.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.846
He believed that Bacon wrote Shakespeare.

00:48.906 --> 00:50.608
He was very interested in numerology.

00:50.648 --> 00:53.652
He was interested in the numerology of Dante and Shakespeare.

00:54.233 --> 01:01.662
He was a radical student of them, read them very, very carefully, but he had some very distinct opinions.

01:02.114 --> 01:03.597
Was he an amateur?

01:03.918 --> 01:05.421
He was an amateur indeed.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.505
I mean, he was a businessman by occupation.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.589
He was an amateur in this field.

01:09.669 --> 01:13.497
He amassed a very, very fine library.

01:13.737 --> 01:17.625
He had a private librarian administer the library.

01:17.825 --> 01:23.591
As it became bigger and bigger, he had separate quarters for it.

01:23.671 --> 01:27.935
Eventually, a building was built for it in Claremont.

01:28.295 --> 01:29.777
There was a private librarian.

01:29.817 --> 01:30.397
He died.

01:30.437 --> 01:33.100
It continued on a foundation basis with a board.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.302
It was dissolved for financial reasons.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.025
Were there any heirs?

01:38.405 --> 01:40.247
There were heirs.

01:42.949 --> 01:45.672
I can't give you the details of that, but yes, there were heirs.

01:46.124 --> 01:47.926
There must be paperwork filed out.

01:47.946 --> 01:49.047
Oh, and undoubtedly.

01:49.227 --> 01:49.808
Oh, of course.

01:50.348 --> 01:52.010
But he died a long time ago.

01:52.931 --> 01:56.815
The books were given to the Huntington Library.

01:56.835 --> 01:57.876
Straight gift or sale?

01:58.097 --> 02:02.721
It's more complicated than that.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.244
Inevitably, it is.

02:05.264 --> 02:05.524
Yes.

02:07.466 --> 02:09.769
I'll let the Huntington talk about that specifically.

02:09.789 --> 02:13.853
The person you want to talk to is Alan Judsy, J-U-T-C-I.

02:14.339 --> 02:22.051
Now, and it wasn't a situation where it was foregone that it would go to the Huntington.

02:22.071 --> 02:24.314
There were other negotiations with Claremont.

02:24.595 --> 02:26.818
I mean, the major loser... It's still up and up, by the way.

02:26.898 --> 02:28.060
I'm with this all the way.

02:28.541 --> 02:39.918
The major loser in this situation, clearly, of course, was... The major loser was Claremont, because it had a wonderful shirt.

02:39.938 --> 02:43.283
Claremont College, because it had a wonderful resource, an added resource.

02:44.444 --> 02:58.293
To some extent, the library, you will use what I'm saying delicately, the librarian was very much in the 19th century.

02:58.474 --> 03:01.380
The librarian was still in the 19th century in many ways.

03:02.101 --> 03:03.625
There was a dial telephone.

03:03.925 --> 03:05.288
Dial telephone.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.211
There was no computer.

03:09.993 --> 03:15.620
So one of the things that happens as this moves to the Huntington is very, very high-level bibliographic work.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.283
Now, it's not that this was a secret institution.

03:18.303 --> 03:20.565
I mean, people came from all over the world to work here.

03:20.926 --> 03:21.907
It indeed was used.

03:22.167 --> 03:31.157
But the level of utilization probably was not commensurate with what could have been the case and what will be the case now that the material will be online.

03:31.137 --> 03:33.861
So in the long run, scholarship doesn't suffer.

03:33.881 --> 03:38.589
I mean, the material, the really good material is still there.

03:39.951 --> 03:43.697
The question is, what do you lose when an institution goes out of existence?

03:43.717 --> 03:47.443
And there is a loss, and I'll talk about that if you want.

03:47.663 --> 03:49.165
I've thought about writing on this.

03:50.868 --> 03:54.073
When you have a small institution, you have a focal point.

03:54.728 --> 03:59.875
No matter how good that collection is, within the Huntington, it becomes a small collection.

04:01.277 --> 04:15.515
And when you have a separate small institution, it becomes a focal point for those people who are committed, not just to the Bacon Road Shakespeare, but to Bacon and to Baconian studies.

04:15.535 --> 04:18.940
That book, that library was astounding.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.702
You could pick up a book on...

04:20.783 --> 04:29.296
Any book in that library, you'd open up, and it would say on the front, paste down end paper, see page so-and-so for Bacon reference.

04:29.316 --> 04:39.332
Now, if it was a 17th century book, or a book about the 17th century, there was no surprise to you that there were references to Bacon.

04:39.970 --> 04:49.049
Bacon's influence, of course, was so great that you would walk in that library and see books that you, on the surface, were unrelated to Bacon.

04:49.510 --> 04:50.211
And you'd pick them up.

04:50.732 --> 04:55.081
There would be the page reference, and you'd be making these connections that you never saw before.

04:55.101 --> 04:56.524
That's the whole essence of a library.

04:56.584 --> 04:57.085
Exactly.

04:57.335 --> 04:59.418
So in that sense... That's what a library does.

04:59.438 --> 05:01.201
Exactly, exactly.

05:01.481 --> 05:02.643
What do they call them today?

05:03.244 --> 05:05.687
They're not even being called libraries anymore.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.210
You know what I'm saying?

05:07.230 --> 05:13.779
Research, the new names that institutions are giving these centers or whatever.

05:13.839 --> 05:16.343
But this is really what libraries... That's right.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.845
And there is a real loss.

05:17.865 --> 05:22.532
And the book that you would go in and have this epiphanous moment, that's probably been sold, that book.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.701
very likely for one of two reasons.

05:25.821 --> 05:31.408
Either the Huntington has it already, or it's a relatively common book that's accessible.

05:31.468 --> 05:37.096
But there is a certain kind of a logical alchemy that goes on by the collection.

05:37.357 --> 05:41.622
As far as I'm concerned, that's absolutely true, and that's a definite loss.

05:41.642 --> 05:47.170
Now, with computerization and Boolean logic built into computers and all that,

05:47.302 --> 05:50.751
Other things and cross-references are accessible more and more.

05:51.051 --> 05:56.285
So it's not a straightforward cut-and-dry loss situation.

05:56.345 --> 06:00.435
But I think there's a loss, and I think the kind of thing that you just described is very real.

06:00.816 --> 06:04.365
People wandering the shelves is a...

06:04.345 --> 06:21.267
It's not... The kinds of magic that can occur in browsing, the connections that can get made, the way new ideas come into your head by the juxtaposition of things that you're seeing is very real, I think.

06:21.287 --> 06:25.273
And in that sense, I think there's a real loss when small libraries like this probes.

06:25.293 --> 06:33.964
I wouldn't use you as the... I would just like to... What would be a contact for somebody to call as to how the decision came to be made to...

06:34.450 --> 06:36.034
to dissolve this institution?

06:36.094 --> 06:37.397
Who would I follow?

06:37.598 --> 06:44.956
Well, I think you'd want to talk more with me and then more with Alan Jutsi as the first two steps.

06:44.976 --> 06:45.076
Yeah.

06:45.176 --> 06:47.903
That's really... This is not, you know, there's nothing negative here.

06:48.284 --> 06:48.464
No, no.

06:48.525 --> 06:51.953
I'd just like to know what kind of a thought process went on.

06:52.270 --> 06:58.598
what factors came into play, and whether or not the kinds of issues you just articulated to me were ever considered.

06:59.139 --> 07:11.595
John Niven, N-I-V-E-N, who was a retired emeritus professor at the Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, California, 91711,

07:11.980 --> 07:17.007
Favorite target of Steven Blumberg, who's back in prison again.

07:17.668 --> 07:19.130
I'm glad to hear he's back in prison.

07:19.150 --> 07:20.272
What did he get back in prison for?

07:20.312 --> 07:22.535
A violation of his parole.

07:22.555 --> 07:24.418
He'll be out in seven months.

07:24.498 --> 07:27.121
Take care of business, brother.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.584
Oh, I need to take care of business.

07:28.604 --> 07:33.430
No, no, it's only one thing I was going to talk over.

07:35.313 --> 07:36.655
Um...

07:37.748 --> 07:43.073
This is Charles Goldsmith continuing to talk about the Bacon Foundation.

07:43.133 --> 07:57.585
Elizabeth Wrigley was the librarian for Wolf Conrad Ahrensberg, his private librarian, and then when the foundation started and when there was a separate building and so forth and so on, she continued.

07:57.605 --> 07:58.626
She is still alive.

07:58.666 --> 07:59.727
She's quite ill.

07:59.767 --> 08:00.547
She's a good book woman.

08:00.928 --> 08:05.872
She is an extraordinarily knowledgeable person about Francis Bacon.

08:05.892 --> 08:07.333
She's a trained librarian.

08:07.313 --> 08:18.048
And she was resistant to, for better and for worse, resistant to the 20th century in terms of trends of librarianship.

08:18.108 --> 08:19.570
Extraordinarily knowledgeable person.

08:20.311 --> 08:21.513
Very serious.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.201
She lives in an L.A.

08:27.722 --> 08:30.486
suburb, and I can get you the address, but I don't recall it.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.090
She's quite, she's ill.

08:34.772 --> 08:36.274
She has the faculties?

08:36.541 --> 08:39.165
Yes and no.

08:42.370 --> 08:43.872
More or less.

08:46.376 --> 08:49.181
Did she ever write a memoir or a recollection?

08:49.201 --> 08:55.731
No, and she'd be interesting to talk to.

08:56.926 --> 09:01.654
Way in the place, in the sense of capital R, boldface, underlined.

09:02.536 --> 09:09.147
And there were other people who worked there over the years, and I can tell you things about that.

09:09.167 --> 09:12.533
This had some element of a social club to it.

09:13.014 --> 09:15.859
Good sharing and good scotch.

09:15.879 --> 09:18.023
Friday afternoon gatherings and so forth.

09:18.003 --> 09:33.505
And I say that, I mean, you can say that with cynicism, and then you can also say that with profound envy, because anyone who knows anything about, say, English traditions or book people, book places, it's a book place.

09:33.625 --> 09:40.114
It's a book place, and it did, I mean, quite specifically, they don't call them libraries, they call them book places, that can be anything.

09:40.855 --> 09:42.137
And that's, uh...

09:43.012 --> 09:58.827
I'm writing a catalogue, slowly, on Claremont, because I'm focusing a catalogue on books that are about printed in

09:59.617 --> 10:05.462
written in, associated with, by printers from Claremont.

10:05.482 --> 10:10.206
It's an idiosyncratic thing to do, probably a commercial and idiotic thing to do, but I'm doing it.

10:10.226 --> 10:13.689
Dr. Rob Black, you might think it's a wonderful thing to do.

10:13.789 --> 10:16.251
Yeah, but it's one of the things I've been working on for years.

10:16.352 --> 10:18.894
I have a wall full of books in that area.

10:19.294 --> 10:25.539
In any event, you might want to talk to Niven also, because he was one of the key people on the board.

10:25.559 --> 10:26.300
He's at Claremont.

10:26.340 --> 10:29.623
He is living in Claremont, emeritus professor.

10:29.603 --> 10:33.468
and I'm coming out to L.A.

10:33.509 --> 10:34.410
maybe this fall.

10:34.931 --> 10:40.078
Well, give me a call, because I'll give you more details than we have time for it now.

10:40.939 --> 10:43.603
Lloyd Colton is in writing a book.

10:43.803 --> 10:44.424
Excuse me?

10:44.484 --> 10:46.006
Lloyd Colton is in writing a book.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.328
Yeah, my reputation.

10:48.009 --> 10:52.756
Anyway, I'd be happy to talk more about that.

10:52.776 --> 10:53.116
Okay.

10:53.136 --> 10:56.802
Do you have a specific thing you want me to speak to?

10:56.822 --> 10:59.205
No, I think you've got a good start.
