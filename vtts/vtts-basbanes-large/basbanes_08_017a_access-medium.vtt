WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:07.607
There it is.

00:07.687 --> 00:10.630
Okay, good.

00:10.650 --> 00:21.963
So, I guess everybody wants to probe the Wonderboy image of yourself of your own.

00:21.983 --> 00:26.208
I mean, the fact that you appeared with such stunning success at the age of, what, 24?

00:26.348 --> 00:27.770
Yeah, 24.

00:27.850 --> 00:31.354
And the pressure that you must have felt that you...

00:31.705 --> 00:36.972
I guess admittedly felt teacher-producer to see him fall off low.

00:37.553 --> 00:39.836
Let's just start here.

00:39.856 --> 00:41.738
Let's enter the conversation.

00:41.758 --> 00:45.463
I'm sure we'll take it very well.

00:45.483 --> 00:45.583
Yeah.

00:45.603 --> 01:00.463
I think, I mean, I know I was definitely trying to poke some fun at the notion of being a Wonderboy.

01:00.781 --> 01:21.979
But the pressures that you talk about that I felt after my first book came out and did fairly well, I mean, I wouldn't say it was a complete smash success that made it impossible for me to

01:22.482 --> 01:25.306
to walk down the street without being recognized.

01:25.366 --> 01:32.517
I think it was a pretty small thing in its way.

01:32.777 --> 01:39.066
It wasn't the success of the book so much or anything like that that I felt putting pressure on me so much.

01:42.050 --> 01:48.760
I think I just was

01:49.550 --> 01:52.873
eager to show that I could do more than that.

01:53.574 --> 01:55.276
Yeah, but you were about 24.

01:55.296 --> 02:01.662
I mean, that's hardly... I mean, I was just going to thought that you'd be next to the age of 24 years old.

02:02.103 --> 02:02.383
Right.

02:02.403 --> 02:12.193
Well, I suppose I just felt after I finished that, inevitably, when you finish something, you think, well, that was fine, but I can do much better.

02:12.213 --> 02:18.139
And I was, I think, so eager to show that I could do better that I think I just...

02:18.912 --> 02:27.765
I chose a book and I chose a subject matter, or I should say a compendium of subject matters.

02:28.346 --> 02:33.915
That was just too much for me to handle, and the book got away from me, I think, because it was too ambitious.

02:33.935 --> 02:35.738
You're talking about Fountain City?

02:36.278 --> 02:38.001
Fountain City, yeah.

02:38.622 --> 02:54.724
so i mean it that was the pressure in that sense was just to try to top myself um and i think i tried a little too hard to top myself um now what's happened to quantum city has that been it's in a couple of cardboard kinko

02:55.025 --> 02:59.116
coffee boxes in my closet in my office, but there it will remain.

02:59.397 --> 03:03.489
Is it there to remind you of your human problems?

03:03.990 --> 03:08.483
Something that you hope at some point that you might even be able to revive?

03:08.723 --> 03:09.907
No, the former.

03:09.947 --> 03:10.789
The former.

03:11.123 --> 03:17.030
You know, I can't quite prove myself to throw it away, but I don't think I'd ever really look at it again.

03:17.671 --> 03:20.234
And I certainly don't plan to show it to anyone.

03:20.254 --> 03:21.956
Did you ever, has anyone seen it?

03:21.976 --> 03:24.479
Yeah, my agent and my editor.

03:24.779 --> 03:26.121
What did your agent think?

03:26.141 --> 03:27.623
They thought I should keep working on it.

03:27.863 --> 03:28.484
Really?

03:29.264 --> 03:35.472
And they were very surprised when I didn't, and I didn't tell them that I had stopped working on it when I started Wonder Boys.

03:35.572 --> 03:36.473
I didn't tell anybody.

03:37.145 --> 03:39.327
Did it just become too unwieldy?

03:39.347 --> 03:41.089
Yeah, it was too much.

03:41.269 --> 03:50.218
There were too many characters and too many different plot lines.

03:50.358 --> 03:55.903
I was working on it for so long that I just lost interest in the material a bit.

03:55.923 --> 04:03.671
Did you think that with so many characters and so many plot lines that there's a chance you could probably chip off a couple of short stories out of it?

04:03.791 --> 04:06.173
No, but I can definitely pull

04:06.423 --> 04:08.566
sentences out of it here and there.

04:08.586 --> 04:12.052
Maybe a few set-piece descriptions or something like that.

04:12.172 --> 04:15.457
And I already have just a few here and there.

04:15.717 --> 04:17.680
So I probably will be cannibalizing it.

04:18.041 --> 04:24.070
I thought Jonathan Yardley's review of this book was really excellent.

04:24.090 --> 04:29.578
So did I. And of course, you know, he's wonderful.

04:30.250 --> 04:40.902
But do you agree that he's looking at the arc of your career, I guess, and he said, the apprenticeship is over.

04:41.142 --> 04:42.324
How do you respond to that?

04:42.384 --> 04:48.651
That was a pretty sobering last paragraph of that review, and it definitely made an impression on me.

04:48.831 --> 04:56.460
Obviously, after everything that he had said before that, I owed it to him to listen to what he said at the end of the review.

04:56.693 --> 05:20.710
I mean, I suppose I'd say that I already knew what he says at the end of the review, and my ambition for myself is certainly to eventually, I would like to be able to attempt a book like Found City and have it not feel like too much and feel that I was up to handling it.

05:21.787 --> 05:25.091
many characters and multiple plot lines and so on.

05:25.111 --> 05:28.456
And then I'm reading War and Peace right now, which I've never read before.

05:29.197 --> 05:36.366
And, you know, it is a wonderful book and it certainly is something to aim for and, of course, you'll never achieve.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.547
It is justifiable.

05:37.668 --> 05:38.929
It's a great novel.

05:38.949 --> 05:46.379
I mean, I remember the first time I read the Brothers Karamasa, I was in college and it was an assignment.

05:46.399 --> 05:47.260
She said, gee, this is good.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.662
This is very good.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.162
The second one.

05:49.183 --> 05:49.583
And, uh,

05:50.845 --> 05:58.613
Now, your first book, I guess, was, did you have any idea that your thesis was being submitted?

05:59.835 --> 06:12.368
Well, the way it happened was I had been showing it all along the whole time I was writing it to my teacher, whose name was Don Heine, who wrote under the name of MacDonald Harris.

06:12.648 --> 06:13.249
M-A-C-D-O-L?

06:13.309 --> 06:14.170
Yes.

06:14.723 --> 06:17.086
How do you spell Heiney?

06:17.466 --> 06:19.108
Heiney, A-T-I-N-E-Y.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.349
Which name was he?

06:20.369 --> 06:20.550
Donald.

06:20.590 --> 06:23.613
He died about three years ago.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.015
Because your quarters don't give a spell.

06:25.035 --> 06:25.956
Right, they don't.

06:28.058 --> 06:42.334
Anyway, I had just been showing it to him when I was half done and three quarters done, and so when I got to the end of my first draft, I showed it to him, naturally, because I'd been showing it to him all along, and I put it in his little box in the English department, and

06:42.668 --> 06:51.982
I was on a Friday and on Monday it was back in my box in Magnus Park with a note saying, I hope you don't mind, but I sent this to my agent in New York.

06:52.022 --> 06:53.945
I can't make any promises.

06:53.965 --> 06:56.088
Don't expect anything.

06:56.108 --> 06:59.133
Maybe they'll be interested.

06:59.173 --> 07:04.761
I knew what had happened, but I didn't give my consent.

07:04.741 --> 07:09.947
I hadn't even gotten to the point yet in my mind that I thought about what to do with it.

07:09.987 --> 07:11.189
This is California?

07:11.209 --> 07:17.396
Yeah, at UC Irvine.

07:17.416 --> 07:19.259
Sorry, I lost the track here.

07:19.279 --> 07:21.001
Were you planning at this point?

07:21.021 --> 07:25.887
Did you see yourself pointing towards a career as a fiction writer?

07:25.927 --> 07:27.589
Yeah, definitely.

07:27.629 --> 07:31.153
I thought I was going to... My roommate,

07:31.859 --> 07:52.454
at that time was a fellow student in the program, and his name is Louis B. Jones, and at the time he had written four novels, and it was his fifth, which he wrote at UC Irvine that got published.

07:52.474 --> 07:52.734
Great.

07:53.155 --> 07:55.639
Yeah, and it's a really great book, Ordinary Money.

07:55.822 --> 07:57.164
And since then, he's written another.

07:57.845 --> 08:02.773
But still, I thought he was 33 or 34 at the time, I think.

08:03.074 --> 08:05.538
And I wanted to be like him.

08:05.578 --> 08:07.180
That was my goal, I thought.

08:07.501 --> 08:12.008
I admired him for having stuck with it so long and having written so many books.

08:12.680 --> 08:26.881
To get back to the Yardley observation, which I thought was interesting, I think it's, of course, keying on the fact that in the first two novels, and I guess they didn't know about the story, that would be all those stories.

08:26.901 --> 08:28.162
The first person, yeah.

08:28.223 --> 08:29.625
Actually, he's wrong about the story.

08:30.366 --> 08:33.951
After I read that, I went back and checked, and I counted them.

08:34.411 --> 08:37.276
And the majority of them are actually written in the third person, yeah.

08:37.296 --> 08:38.557
So he's wrong on that.

08:38.598 --> 08:42.383
Because he's really seen this as a developmental thing, that he wants you to

08:43.156 --> 08:47.963
Right.

08:48.404 --> 08:58.258
I see his point to a degree, but I think that that Grady trip is so different from me.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.061
He's older.

09:00.081 --> 09:08.373
He's older and everything, his whole way of looking at writing and the writers he loves and everything.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.678
We have very few similarities, he and I.

09:12.147 --> 09:16.774
It was such an act of impersonation for me.

09:17.615 --> 09:18.276
The ventriloquism?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.279
Yeah, in a way, to be Grady Chip.

09:20.319 --> 09:22.863
The ventriloquism does bring us the voice.

09:23.324 --> 09:25.167
When you finish, I want to get on to that.

09:25.187 --> 09:27.170
Just remember that, but continue.

09:27.390 --> 09:31.877
I think that's a very big difference between that first person

09:32.093 --> 09:48.596
narration and the one in my first book, which I will conceive is much closer to me and was much less an act of ventricularism in a sense and much more sort of a first novel-y kind of just saying what I think or what I feel.

09:49.457 --> 09:51.640
I don't feel that that's all the case with Wonder Boy.

09:52.261 --> 09:56.867
I think there's a qualitative difference in the kind of narration that each book has.

09:57.568 --> 10:00.632
So I think his point is, you know, I think it's

10:02.165 --> 10:14.233
I see his point, and I do tend to attempt third-person narration, but only because it's fun and interesting and you can get different effects from doing it, not because I think it's

10:14.467 --> 10:20.353
necessarily the next logical step in some kind of progression.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.116
I'm not addressing myself to Yardley, per se.

10:23.216 --> 10:24.998
It's just a departure point.

10:25.098 --> 10:29.403
I really never bring in what other critics say.

10:29.423 --> 10:34.889
I am interested in the observation because we're worth exploring.

10:34.909 --> 10:35.670
He's a great critic.

10:36.711 --> 10:40.795
But I think that with the case of

10:41.652 --> 10:47.581
You have left yourself, even though he's narrating all of them.

10:47.601 --> 10:49.444
He is a funny amount of character.

10:49.625 --> 10:49.885
Right.

10:50.045 --> 10:55.113
It talks to me a little bit about how did you get this voice?

10:56.255 --> 10:58.759
I stumbled on it almost in the beginning.

10:58.799 --> 11:00.502
Did you hear it?

11:00.522 --> 11:02.124
Did you hear it?

11:02.144 --> 11:06.411
Within the first page and a half of starting to write the book,

11:07.353 --> 11:12.660
I sensed I was on to a voice that I could stay with.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.646
It didn't really ever let me down.

11:17.167 --> 11:30.565
I don't know where it came from or how I knew what Grady was going to sound like, but I found that I did.

11:30.665 --> 11:33.529
I just sort of climbed on his voice and surfed.

11:33.948 --> 11:38.033
Did you realize that this was going to be funny?

11:38.053 --> 11:39.315
I don't think so.

11:39.335 --> 11:43.019
I mean, you know, I didn't deliberately laugh.

11:43.860 --> 11:44.261
Yeah.

11:44.841 --> 11:53.071
I mean, sometimes when I'm working, I find myself laughing at something I just wrote or like rub my hands together.

11:53.252 --> 11:53.812
Definitely.

11:53.993 --> 11:58.238
But I mean, it's not a deliberate effort at all.

11:58.358 --> 12:00.781
I mean, I didn't set out to write.

12:00.961 --> 12:02.503
I never try to be

12:03.378 --> 12:23.563
deliberately funny and when I find myself getting on I feel like a certain brittleness creeping in to my tone because it's brittleness because I'm trying to be too funny then I try to step back and and take that out if I can or tone that down I think it's you know I I think the humor

12:24.100 --> 12:34.573
Really, to me, the humor of Gritty arises out of his own self-deprecation and his willingness to hold himself up as an object of ridicule.

12:36.115 --> 12:45.366
Then you can accept all of the other things he says about other people and the criticisms he makes or the sour generalizations he engages in.

12:45.886 --> 12:49.590
I think it makes it more funny overall because he's so hard on himself.

12:49.670 --> 12:51.972
I think the humor is really organic.

12:51.992 --> 12:54.895
I mean, I think it's impossible to take it out of context.

12:55.156 --> 13:03.945
I know from writing it, from my readers, it's difficult to try and explain the humor by example.

13:03.965 --> 13:07.068
I think you really have to set up the context of the situation.

13:07.168 --> 13:09.691
Right, right.

13:09.711 --> 13:13.615
I really admire that in the writing.

13:13.595 --> 13:16.798
Do you like the art of your premiere right now?

13:16.959 --> 13:19.141
I mean... That's interesting.

13:19.161 --> 13:20.382
I can't complain.

13:20.402 --> 13:21.423
No, you can't complain.

13:21.523 --> 13:24.086
I've been with you with like... Right here.

13:24.206 --> 13:25.387
In fact, that was yours.

13:25.407 --> 13:26.929
They let us go in and sit down.

13:27.149 --> 13:29.191
I just went early in the morning.

13:29.211 --> 13:33.195
I'm surprised they didn't let us sit, but this is my name.

13:33.836 --> 13:37.720
And, you know, he's still in this series, I guess.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.463
And I said, you know...

13:40.443 --> 13:45.855
He feels that now is the time for experimentation at the young age.

13:45.935 --> 13:48.661
He said, you know, when you get older, you do kind of get it wrong.

13:48.681 --> 13:51.668
Because if you're really going to do all new things, you do it wrong.

13:52.069 --> 13:55.697
That's an interesting observation.

13:55.717 --> 13:56.258
Yeah.

13:56.440 --> 14:04.589
I mean, he said, he considers it laziness to think that over the course of your career, the great books are going to come later on.

14:04.609 --> 14:06.771
I mean, you really have to take your whack at it now.

14:07.612 --> 14:09.574
Yeah, I mean, I think that's right.

14:09.594 --> 14:11.997
I mean, I certainly don't.

14:12.097 --> 14:22.228
I always think the book that I'm working on currently, at least for the first two or three years that I'm working on it,

14:22.765 --> 14:25.289
is the best thing that I've ever done.

14:28.213 --> 14:33.641
In the case of Fountain City, after three years I started having my doubts.

14:37.106 --> 14:42.934
I don't know how interested I am in doing old, new things necessarily.

14:44.483 --> 14:48.088
Do you have a sense of where you are as a writer?

14:48.168 --> 14:55.499
How I fit into the tradition?

14:56.941 --> 15:08.618
Well, I think I see myself as a very traditional kind of writer, more conventional in a sense, although I think

15:09.425 --> 15:13.490
I'm talking about arts with conventions of another time.

15:13.530 --> 15:22.322
But I'm not trying any kind of bold, formal experimentation.

15:22.342 --> 15:33.597
I'm not trying any... I don't want to... I don't know, perform any kind of surgery on the English language or anything like that.

15:34.138 --> 15:38.003
Would you consider yourself a storyteller in a traditional sense?

15:38.023 --> 15:38.824
That would be...

15:39.344 --> 15:48.593
No, I mean, I would like to consider myself a storyteller, but I think telling a story is to me the hardest part of writing.

15:50.856 --> 16:04.930
The thing I have to work on the most, and the thing I'm most deliberate and careful about, because I feel like it's the thing that in a sense comes at least naturally to me, of all the various tools you need to be a writer.

16:05.517 --> 16:09.742
And I think storytelling obviously is one of the most important ones.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.207
That's the one that I have to work on.

16:13.587 --> 16:15.009
Do you have a sense of who your reader is?

16:19.254 --> 16:20.536
Well, it's changing.

16:20.576 --> 16:34.073
Earlier, after my first book, I would have said my readership tended to be young and tended to be somewhat gay.

16:35.757 --> 16:45.632
But after this book has come out, and I've gotten a lot of response, because I published the email address and the jacket of that book, so I got a lot of email, and I got...

16:45.848 --> 17:11.147
know you can judge from the people that show up for your readings and so on and it's a much more varied group than it used to be in terms of age um just last night i was answering email and there was some from a kid there's a message yeah my laptop there was a message from a kid who just graduated from uva he was 22 and and then there was a message from somebody in california who said he's in his 50s and

17:11.718 --> 17:15.246
They take my column in Charlottesville, by the way.

17:15.266 --> 17:15.646
Oh, do they?

17:15.887 --> 17:18.673
Oh, man, I hope you see it.

17:19.234 --> 17:20.637
I read about 25 papers.

17:20.657 --> 17:21.960
Yeah, that's what I actually told you.

17:21.980 --> 17:29.195
Not in California, unfortunately, but I'm working on largely college towns, and that's why I was really interested.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.342
I would tend to think that you've been a really very solid following,

17:32.508 --> 17:38.359
I've had Eugene, Oregon, Knoxville, and Charlottesville, and Austin.

17:38.379 --> 17:40.222
We're going to Austin.

17:40.542 --> 17:40.943
When?

17:40.963 --> 17:42.506
Friday.

17:42.546 --> 17:45.692
This won't be out by night for you, but that's fine.

17:45.712 --> 17:46.333
Anyway, I'm sorry.

17:46.653 --> 17:51.322
Yeah, I mean, it just seems I've gotten much more diverse in terms of men and women and older and younger.

17:51.362 --> 17:54.948
That was so interesting.

17:54.968 --> 17:55.309
Thank you.

17:55.289 --> 17:56.390
This is funny.

17:56.410 --> 18:00.194
I mean, it seems to me to pick you with motivation.

18:00.794 --> 18:01.755
I know, that was funny.

18:01.815 --> 18:02.957
That was so funny.

18:02.977 --> 18:04.598
How do you respond to that when you see it?

18:04.618 --> 18:10.324
I mean, I guess it's a compliment in a way, because you really did.

18:10.985 --> 18:17.311
You characterized without sentimentality or without... Yeah, I took it as a compliment.

18:17.471 --> 18:22.556
...a segment of the community in an honest way.

18:22.576 --> 18:24.638
And so this critic made an assumption

18:25.445 --> 18:28.708
Were you surprised when you saw this?

18:29.109 --> 18:30.090
Yeah, I was surprised.

18:30.170 --> 18:35.155
When was that?

18:35.675 --> 18:36.616
That was 1988.

18:36.996 --> 18:39.759
Right when the book came out.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.162
It was a nice picture.

18:42.182 --> 18:43.383
I don't remember it.

18:44.003 --> 18:48.208
I was a book editor then, so it was a literary event.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.710
Of course, it was a few years ago, isn't it?

18:50.977 --> 18:51.758
I'm sorry I missed it.

18:52.038 --> 18:53.340
Where were you a book editor?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.702
In Worcester.

18:56.304 --> 18:59.869
I came through Boston for that book too, although I didn't do a reading in Boston.

18:59.909 --> 19:01.371
They had me out in Sudbury.

19:01.451 --> 19:04.916
It's close to where I am.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.899
I had my reading in Sudbury.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.703
Three people showed up.

19:10.304 --> 19:16.512
A woman and a father and his eight-year-old son who happened to wander into the bookstore and they got shanghaied into it.

19:16.947 --> 19:22.275
And I sat in a chair, and they sat, like one sat there and one sat there.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.198
It was like story hour at the library.

19:24.218 --> 19:29.165
It really is, uh... I just have, I have a book that's a non-fiction.

19:29.185 --> 19:30.968
Yeah.

19:30.988 --> 19:35.434
You know, you really, it is sobering to go to some sightings.

19:35.454 --> 19:37.978
And you're all excited.

19:37.998 --> 19:38.459
I know.

19:39.140 --> 19:44.828
And most of the people who walk past, they look, they avert their eyes so they don't have to... Well, I love a guy on the fucking side of the line.

19:45.061 --> 19:48.585
Congratulations, I love the jacket, the book jacket.

19:50.247 --> 19:51.789
I may come back later.

19:54.433 --> 19:59.879
Don't you feel like you're just like those people that have outside of Hickory Farms with the cheese and the sausage?

20:00.200 --> 20:06.628
Yeah, I know, and you feel like you have to buy a thing on the sausage.

20:06.708 --> 20:07.950
That's the fine news.

20:08.050 --> 20:09.371
It's a good quality.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.975
What was the first print of the first one?

20:12.255 --> 20:12.876
Was it Ryan?

20:13.116 --> 20:13.937
I think it was

20:14.187 --> 20:18.414
Pretty good for a first book, yeah, first novel.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.135
Something like that.

20:19.155 --> 20:19.696
Really?

20:19.716 --> 20:21.739
And then it went into four printings.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.360
Great.

20:22.481 --> 20:25.405
How many else together did it work?

20:25.426 --> 20:25.946
I think four.

20:25.966 --> 20:26.728
I mean, four printings.

20:26.748 --> 20:29.813
I don't know how many copies.

20:29.833 --> 20:30.794
That's terrific.

20:31.776 --> 20:32.938
That was moral, right?

20:32.958 --> 20:33.799
Yeah, that was moral.

20:33.819 --> 20:37.866
The paperback, I know, they just recently, like,

20:38.133 --> 20:44.602
I sat down and did an accounting, and it has sold just about 100,000 copies.

20:44.922 --> 20:46.064
That's wonderful.

20:46.084 --> 20:51.230
That's pretty good.

20:51.250 --> 21:04.788
The fact that you emerged in a generation at the time, I guess there was a wave of young writers appearing.

21:04.808 --> 21:05.189
Right.

21:05.910 --> 21:06.030
Right.

21:06.179 --> 21:12.527
You see, you have distinguished yourself by hard work and dedication and no controversy.

21:12.927 --> 21:13.168
Yeah.

21:13.688 --> 21:17.673
I mean, you really explained that.

21:17.733 --> 21:20.056
You seem to have a good rest of your life.

21:20.176 --> 21:22.139
You have a Pittsburgh work out.

21:22.159 --> 21:23.741
It's very pressing.

21:23.841 --> 21:24.121
Thanks.

21:24.462 --> 21:28.487
I mean, I think it's just, I'm not, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I didn't live in New York.

21:29.468 --> 21:30.229
No, I was not.

21:31.019 --> 21:47.492
My entree into the literary run was not through New York and through... Yes, I mean, it's not a real glamorous place, and I just don't... You know, that kind of life of night clubbing and

21:48.434 --> 21:54.521
and hanging around with famous people and so on just didn't ever appeal to me.

21:54.541 --> 21:58.687
I just, I like to do my writing and then... It seems to me that we are.

21:58.707 --> 22:00.449
Well, Casio said the same thing, by the way.

22:00.469 --> 22:09.780
He said, you know, he's a young guy, and he said, he said, I feel that the time to write is now, not to go to cocktail parties, because the time might pass you by, and it's gone.

22:09.860 --> 22:13.505
Well, I don't even have to look at it that way, because I have no interest in going to cocktail parties.

22:13.565 --> 22:14.466
I hate parties.

22:14.486 --> 22:15.227
I hate parties.

22:15.247 --> 22:17.850
I'm not a very social...

22:18.387 --> 22:36.970
person i can't i just i'm very uncomfortable in those kind of settings and if i did go i would just stand in the corner so it's not it's not even a temptation so i don't even have to uh remind myself that the time is now or anything even if the time were now i still wouldn't do it

22:37.608 --> 22:47.099
If you would explain to me, you know, Pittsburgh as metaphor for you, or is it a metaphor, or is it just a very comfortable place to hang your hat?

22:47.119 --> 22:47.900
Very much that.

22:48.221 --> 22:54.248
I mean, I think the first book, it was very natural for me to set in Pittsburgh because I had lived there fairly recently.

22:54.308 --> 23:01.917
I had a raft of experiences there that I was able to draw on and to make a novel out of and so on.

23:03.219 --> 23:05.321
So that was natural and inevitable.

23:05.562 --> 23:06.703
I think...

23:07.038 --> 23:10.323
I never ever expected to go back again, ever.

23:10.343 --> 23:12.988
I thought that was the book I had written in Pittsburgh.

23:13.008 --> 23:33.501
But I think that in the aftermath of the collapse of Fountain City, when I was feeling very shaky about myself and my work, and I had a lot of doubts about whether I could really do it again, it just was such a comfortable place for me.

23:33.599 --> 23:35.462
It felt so safe and secure.

23:35.502 --> 23:36.023
I knew it.

23:36.163 --> 23:37.184
I knew it really well.

23:37.545 --> 23:42.653
And I just, in a way, I think I kind of fled to the safety of Pittsburgh.

23:43.534 --> 23:48.522
As a physical place or as a... I mean, in my imagination.

23:48.982 --> 23:52.347
Do you feel you know it well enough to... Just about.

23:52.367 --> 23:56.934
I mean, I think between this book and the first one now, I've said about everything I know about Pittsburgh.

23:57.635 --> 23:58.597
And that's about it.

23:58.977 --> 24:00.079
So what happens from here?

24:00.245 --> 24:05.092
Are you going to be like Will Kennedy?

24:05.293 --> 24:05.613
No.

24:05.813 --> 24:09.078
I know I would have said it after the first one, too, but that's it.

24:09.158 --> 24:11.202
I'm not going back.

24:11.282 --> 24:14.787
The new one's set in New York.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.269
Manhattan?

24:16.289 --> 24:17.571
Yeah, in the 1930s.

24:18.232 --> 24:21.477
Starting in 1939, going through the 40s into...

24:21.642 --> 24:22.603
1954.

24:23.044 --> 24:25.447
That's adorable.

24:25.487 --> 24:27.689
Is the book in progress, as we speak?

24:28.130 --> 24:28.931
Yeah, it's going well.

24:28.991 --> 24:29.672
You're feeling well?

24:29.792 --> 24:30.473
Feeling good about it?

24:30.493 --> 24:32.015
Yeah, a lot of fun.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.176
That's terrific.

24:33.196 --> 24:36.500
And how are you enjoying the house husband's scene?

24:37.702 --> 24:51.058
Well, it just got a lot easier because my wife changed jobs and is now teaching law school at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, so she's around a lot more, at home a lot more, so it's much more of a joint effort now.

24:51.207 --> 24:53.552
than it was when she was working full-time.

24:53.572 --> 24:57.780
So my burden has lessened somewhat.

24:58.542 --> 24:59.544
But yeah, I love it.

24:59.724 --> 25:07.781
I mean, it's my job around the house to do the shopping and cook dinner.

25:07.801 --> 25:11.308
Yeah, I mean, I'm the cook, that's for sure.

25:11.592 --> 25:14.435
My wife's not much of a cook.

25:17.960 --> 25:23.046
Really my favorite thing to do is take my daughter to the grocery store and do the shopping.

25:23.086 --> 25:30.234
She's 15 months old.

25:30.254 --> 25:33.398
She's just to the age now where I can leave her on the kitchen floor with some

25:33.715 --> 25:38.519
Tupperware or pots and pans, and she sits there while I make dinner the whole time and plays by herself.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.621
But this works because you write at night.

25:40.661 --> 25:41.002
Right.

25:41.022 --> 25:43.624
It's just the opposite.

25:43.644 --> 25:45.145
Yeah, you write in the morning?

25:45.185 --> 25:46.487
Well, yeah, I have to be fresh.

25:46.507 --> 25:47.207
I have to be awake.

25:47.427 --> 25:47.768
Yeah.

25:48.188 --> 25:50.911
That's when I'm awake and alert, strangely, yeah.

25:50.931 --> 25:52.972
I can't work in the morning.

25:52.992 --> 25:53.733
I just cannot.

25:54.133 --> 25:54.994
You don't get tired?

25:55.074 --> 25:56.916
You take naps or anything like that?

25:56.936 --> 25:58.297
No, but I sleep in.

25:58.317 --> 25:58.577
Do you?

25:58.658 --> 26:00.860
Yeah, I sleep till 10, 10.30.

26:01.040 --> 26:01.360
Uh-huh.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.082
I go to bed around 3 usually.

26:03.342 --> 26:03.863
What time?

26:03.883 --> 26:04.143
3.

26:05.004 --> 26:06.366
So, like, what hour?

26:06.406 --> 26:09.570
I work from 10 to 3, Monday to Thursday.

26:09.950 --> 26:10.731
Sunday to Thursday.

26:10.751 --> 26:12.013
You write on a word processor?

26:12.033 --> 26:12.854
Yeah, on a Mac.

26:15.417 --> 26:16.879
And have you always written on a word?

26:17.299 --> 26:19.241
As soon as I came out, yeah.

26:19.321 --> 26:20.163
That's great.

26:20.423 --> 26:27.572
I had a teacher in college that, one of the first writing classes I took, who switched us all on to typewriting on a typewriter.

26:27.952 --> 26:30.435
And once I had...

26:30.719 --> 26:31.540
I've gotten used to that.

26:31.560 --> 26:36.548
It was pretty easy to make the adjustment to the computer.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.013
Tell me about your name now.

26:40.093 --> 26:41.615
I thought it was French.

26:41.956 --> 26:45.040
I know it looks French, but it's Russian.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.282
It's white Russian.

26:46.442 --> 26:47.524
I'm called Belarusian.

26:47.544 --> 26:49.587
It means shepherd.

26:49.787 --> 27:00.523
You've told a number of your interviewers that one of the great defining moments of your life, I guess, is how you were shattered by the fact that your parents split up.

27:00.908 --> 27:06.555
Does this reflect itself at all in the writing that you draw on?

27:07.777 --> 27:10.080
Well, yeah.

27:10.340 --> 27:19.132
I wrote half of the story collection is a series of linked short stories that's about a family falling apart.

27:19.252 --> 27:29.886
I drew very directly on my own experience for those stories, but I think

27:30.473 --> 27:49.774
Beyond that, it's been pointed out to me, I'm not sure I was really aware of it, until it was pointed out to me that it seems like a kind of recurring theme in what I write is not just families, but the notion of like defining a family and people sort of trying to define families for themselves.

27:51.576 --> 27:59.164
It goes on very much in this book where you have that kind of cobbled together family of Korean Jews and

27:59.549 --> 28:06.295
strangers and people with very little connection, biological connection to one another, calling themselves a family.

28:06.315 --> 28:20.547
And I think maybe that interest comes about partly at least as a result of my sort of uncertainty about just what my family was if my parents weren't married.

28:21.769 --> 28:28.054
It's such a fundamental tenet of your life as a child that your parents are married to each other and that you have a mother and a father.

28:28.557 --> 28:33.162
is broken, it really kind of throws everything into doubt, I think.

28:34.263 --> 28:37.907
I read you as a very sensitive guy.

28:37.927 --> 28:46.937
In some of the interviews I read, when the first book came out, you were married to another writer, and a lot of it was a joy in it.

28:46.957 --> 28:48.279
I've just been doing the same thing myself.

28:48.299 --> 28:52.223
This was my personal book, my writer, I just published.

28:52.243 --> 28:54.666
And, you know, it's indescribable.

28:54.686 --> 28:58.530
The only thing that surpasses it is having to go on.

28:58.747 --> 29:08.619
I guess for you it was dampened a bit because of the anxiety of how your wife might have been responsible.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.461
Yeah, it was.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.184
Absolutely through no fault of her own.

29:13.224 --> 29:23.597
In a way, it was a question of seamliness, if you know what I mean.

29:23.657 --> 29:27.201
It was almost sort of unseemly.

29:27.333 --> 29:33.700
It would have been unseemly somehow or I felt it, so to take too much obvious pleasure and so on.

29:33.820 --> 29:46.153
You know, I guess I think at this point that it was probably a good thing in hindsight because it kept me from getting out of control or from taking it too seriously or from really believing.

29:46.193 --> 29:54.302
I don't think it would have been my natural tendency to believe what people said about me anyway, but even if it had, I think

29:54.620 --> 29:58.411
being in those circumstances really protected me.

30:00.035 --> 30:07.937
I really haven't gotten into the reading the book critically is my job and so that's really a reason why we haven't

30:08.204 --> 30:15.034
Fiction writers, for me, are the most demanding kinds of interviews because we are dealing with artistic work here.

30:15.094 --> 30:19.240
It's not my job to ask you to explain what you did.

30:19.761 --> 30:21.984
I should be able to do that.

30:22.004 --> 30:23.826
Good, because I'm never very good at it anyway.
