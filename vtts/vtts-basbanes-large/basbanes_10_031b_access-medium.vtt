WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:08.978
Well, you experiment with putting the pink and the red and yellow together.

00:09.599 --> 00:15.306
You do, even though there's just, is there like three colors on this white rose?

00:16.727 --> 00:20.091
Or is it just one white rose to go on the outline of the white rose?

00:20.252 --> 00:26.359
Oh, they're not matched that tightly, I don't think they, I mean, I actually never pursued that.

00:26.913 --> 00:52.330
like maybe that is when the color decisions are made so that what you do is to discover the color decision yeah i think you may be right because this piece fits there and only there and only there yeah but it doesn't have a little slot that's odd oh yes it does have a slot but there's one that's just slots

00:52.512 --> 00:55.516
But first, that seems to me you could experiment.

00:56.037 --> 00:56.858
Oh, that's very good.

00:56.878 --> 00:58.801
Maybe that's the final.

00:59.221 --> 01:01.564
Maybe that's the final product after the study.

01:01.624 --> 01:06.111
I mean, maybe it's developmental.

01:06.131 --> 01:07.633
Maybe it's not here.

01:07.713 --> 01:11.618
I have not come up here with that.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.562
And then you go into the composition.

01:14.582 --> 01:15.944
You get to break the rules.

01:15.964 --> 01:18.027
What level of instruction do you think that would be?

01:18.167 --> 01:18.908
At what level?

01:19.141 --> 01:19.682
I don't know.

01:19.762 --> 01:20.623
A young woman.

01:20.703 --> 01:22.866
I would think adolescent, teenage.

01:22.906 --> 01:24.047
No, why do you say woman?

01:24.408 --> 01:25.729
A young girl.

01:25.909 --> 01:27.111
But it definitely would be female.

01:27.131 --> 01:27.331
Oh, yeah.

01:27.872 --> 01:32.758
It's all, the text is all about why this is good for female taste.

01:33.799 --> 01:34.120
Is it?

01:34.200 --> 01:37.704
Also, that's an interesting woman's studies.

01:37.724 --> 01:46.515
This is very related to, I'm doing some research now on a woman who would have been schooled in this period.

01:46.833 --> 01:52.819
Her mother, actually.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.642
Sure.

01:56.723 --> 01:57.904
I did not know him.

01:57.924 --> 01:59.666
I know of him and I have his.

02:00.206 --> 02:01.468
I believe him.

02:01.908 --> 02:02.869
Yeah, his color cones.

02:02.929 --> 02:04.210
Yeah, yeah.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.894
And I saw the exhibit of the fog of those colored cones.

02:08.034 --> 02:08.595
Right.

02:08.615 --> 02:09.856
Yeah.

02:09.916 --> 02:10.817
Yeah.

02:11.137 --> 02:12.579
Interesting.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.962
Maiden Lane colors by numbers.

02:16.162 --> 02:18.185
Yeah, yeah.

02:18.425 --> 02:27.837
But you know, Nancy, well your question just made me think of that book, which, um, could somebody bring that over?

02:27.857 --> 02:33.324
We're choosing all over in time, but... No, you're right.

02:33.364 --> 02:35.386
How's the glue bill?

02:35.406 --> 02:38.210
I put that out because I want Sue to see.

02:38.230 --> 02:38.430
Oh, right.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.853
Because it's, um, this is...

02:41.845 --> 02:48.214
Really, I had this for a long time and I just suddenly realized, looking at it again, what it is.

02:48.675 --> 02:52.861
And it's related to your question of, is there a right place for things?

02:53.823 --> 03:00.472
This is a type of 20th century art instruction book.

03:00.492 --> 03:02.415
Yeah.

03:02.936 --> 03:06.381
Watch the loose, please.

03:06.501 --> 03:08.144
These were all cutouts.

03:08.164 --> 03:09.345
You can feel them.

03:09.365 --> 03:11.228
There was a certain right place.

03:11.478 --> 03:33.672
to put your stickly furniture oh look at that look at that and so you get you get this whole monster yeah um well we prepare you to to be uh yeah home definitely know how to so these are all isn't that interesting tasted on and in the place where

03:34.107 --> 03:39.393
Kind of like the books that are ticker books.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.076
Yeah, yeah.

03:43.177 --> 03:45.459
They just have to move for you now.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.761
Yeah, yeah.

03:46.781 --> 03:48.623
There's no date.

03:48.883 --> 03:55.670
No, I figure it's 1800 to 1810.

03:55.950 --> 03:57.012
Magnificent condition.

03:57.632 --> 04:01.036
Yeah, absolutely wonderful condition.

04:01.076 --> 04:03.519
How important was condition to you, or was it?

04:03.539 --> 04:03.979
No.

04:04.246 --> 04:34.202
um basically i wanted to learn what was out there and the thing that everybody who looks at this stuff always says well they were artist materials so they got you know they got used and they got paint on them and um now that's not entirely an honest answer if i saw three things lined up and one was really in mint or interesting condition i would much prefer it um

04:35.060 --> 04:39.666
One of the puzzling things to me is most of the things I only saw once.

04:40.287 --> 04:41.508
Ever.

04:41.528 --> 04:44.372
I don't understand that.

04:44.472 --> 04:46.014
I really don't understand it.

04:46.094 --> 04:53.063
But anyway, I'll show you a few more things.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.244
You wanted to know about this.

04:54.385 --> 04:56.587
These are all drawing cards.

04:57.469 --> 05:01.073
Drawing cards have a long history in New England.

05:01.594 --> 05:02.535
And I'm not going to...

05:02.752 --> 05:31.813
open each one but i'll sort of tell you about these are the size of the cards and they came in a little portfolio like that they're all original autographs this was used by the boston public schools english high school the date is 1858 and this is benjamin cole the same artist who was the cole uh drawing card actually cole was not the one at english high

05:32.097 --> 06:00.518
these were this is ben benjamin nutting bf nutting here's a crummy um set with lots of ink on it and this is a really ninch one um is he a wallace nutting connection i don't know it's an interesting question and i wonder if carl is related to the um archaeologist that's an archaeologist call from you know i don't know

06:02.017 --> 06:05.804
This is 1850s, this is what?

06:07.347 --> 06:10.512
The good thing, by the way, you want to know my secret to my success?

06:11.053 --> 06:13.998
Is that I have very bad vision.

06:14.019 --> 06:24.117
And so I can look very closely and see things that if I had on my contact lens, I couldn't see.

06:25.058 --> 06:25.459
So...

06:26.384 --> 06:27.605
I'll show you something.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.488
There are a lot of helpers in the making of this collection.

06:30.528 --> 06:33.370
This, I'll show you something that's kind of great.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.654
You know the name Jacob Abbott from Portland, Maine?

06:37.674 --> 06:41.417
He was a teacher and storybook writer.

06:42.598 --> 06:44.420
A little Rollo book.

06:46.121 --> 06:46.902
Yeah.

06:46.922 --> 06:50.625
These are drawing cards that were published under his name.

06:51.606 --> 06:55.429
These are very hard to get in and out of the box, so I don't want to do it.

06:56.185 --> 07:18.767
too much um yeah this i thought i could share because this is open already this is um learning to make marks yeah development they're all numbered oh look at that i wonder how much to say

07:20.857 --> 07:49.750
the numbering is very interesting because you can find it is a box under here which i'm not going to show it all today because i don't want to get into it but uh i um people started sending me sketchbooks that students made you know that had sometimes a name on it but none of them became any name that is known but they many times numbered the drawings that they did from the drawing cards and so you could begin to really

07:50.152 --> 07:51.714
put these things together.

07:54.637 --> 08:01.566
This is 1850.

08:01.606 --> 08:14.842
I was going to tell you about these helpers, these little angels who came along who were very, yeah.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.145
When did they stop using these cards?

08:18.006 --> 08:19.568
These became

08:20.290 --> 08:22.252
That's a very interesting question.

08:22.272 --> 08:36.265
They become, I think, the sort of light-headed, silly imagery in coloring books.

08:37.747 --> 08:39.589
Actually, there's a step in between.

08:39.649 --> 08:49.318
There's these, and then after Civil War, there is this strong industrial push to

08:49.501 --> 09:17.415
study drawing for design for application to industry and then you get these chromo coloring books with girls with lots of lacy dresses drawing at an easel to inspire you you know i mean completely these are so serious they were not kidding around with these this was this is for children yes not for adults yeah um

09:17.648 --> 09:23.620
You say you haven't seen any of these before, many of these before or since, but have you located them in any bibliography?

09:23.640 --> 09:25.323
In the Peter Marzio.

09:25.343 --> 09:25.884
Most of them?

09:25.924 --> 09:26.846
Yeah.

09:26.866 --> 09:27.728
So they are recorded?

09:27.848 --> 09:29.271
Yeah.

09:29.291 --> 09:30.273
Yeah.

09:30.293 --> 09:31.195
Not all of them.

09:31.475 --> 09:36.906
This, I was talking about my helpers, certain booksellers.

09:37.527 --> 10:00.852
just were so enamored with what i was doing that they would send me things they would send me i got a lot of these sketchbooks without even asking for them but this is one of my great treasures both from whom it came anybody knows sam murray sam murray a bookseller from wilbraham he was one of the great people and um one day

10:01.726 --> 10:05.851
This arrived in the mail, and it happened to be my birthday, which he didn't know.

10:06.972 --> 10:08.574
Look at the quality of this.

10:08.674 --> 10:16.884
And I brought a lot from him, but then he got so enamored with this project of mine.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.368
These are little drawing instructions.

10:20.568 --> 10:23.612
Now, this is a set I have never seen anywhere.

10:23.672 --> 10:26.876
They're called Nudsun's Method for Drawing Instruction.

10:27.497 --> 10:29.599
And the approaches are really different.

10:29.679 --> 10:30.400
Let me see.

10:30.582 --> 10:59.155
where isn't it newton from i don't know where it was published in new york and there um there's a different i mean this is very i'll just show you this this is uh really an application of mechanical drawings this kind of measuring um studies um this came out right this is 64 and this is the beginning of the boom of the industrial application

10:59.573 --> 11:01.656
But I want to show something so beautiful.

11:01.696 --> 11:09.686
This kind of thing is also in the set, as is this.

11:11.608 --> 11:15.072
Anyhow, I think of him when I handle this.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.037
What a rich, so much must come back to you.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.779
Yeah, yeah.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.363
Is that going to the Hutchinson Truth?

11:23.383 --> 11:24.144
All of this is.

11:24.865 --> 11:26.847
How did you get connected to this?

11:27.282 --> 11:44.359
The bookseller who I thought could handle this introduced me to the people at Huntington, and they just sucked over this.

11:44.379 --> 11:49.584
They had a predisposition to be interested in this material.

11:49.604 --> 11:56.091
You know, I have to tell you, now that it's all over and has such a happy ending, I thought I was a nut.

11:56.324 --> 12:07.316
I mean, I was teaching this stuff, and I saw a lot of issues, but I thought, what am I doing?

12:07.897 --> 12:10.700
It was like the gentle madness, you know?

12:10.860 --> 12:13.963
No, it is the gentle madness.

12:14.324 --> 12:15.505
It's a severe case.

12:15.545 --> 12:17.527
Interior vision that draws you.

12:18.589 --> 12:21.852
The thing is, I heard of, well, I could go on.

12:21.872 --> 12:23.534
Gentle madness.

12:23.554 --> 12:24.475
It's a book.

12:24.944 --> 12:53.078
i have discovered that i have um a learning a learning style that needs to learn from objects not from texts and i just could learn from handling these things or even yeah looking for them um these are louis prang's drawing books when prang came over

12:53.277 --> 13:23.132
to this country he thought he was going to make a bundle on our education which indeed he did but the civil war got in the way so these i believe are pre-civil war 18 this is in the middle of the civil war but he made his immediate fortune making maps battle maps lithographically for when the troops were in the civil war and then

13:24.040 --> 13:53.727
after the civil war came back to the art education stuff and was voracious for getting the business of drawing manuals drawing cards he hooked up with walter smith who was this british educator who was brought over here and so there's tons of things in the name of prang prang ultimately as i see it um

13:54.145 --> 14:23.038
kicked i encourage walter smith to go back to london kept the reputation of the drawing books had and put his wife and other artists in the position of making books that looked a lot like the smith books but were not but the amount of money that was to be made most people don't even understand it's about contemporary education the textbook business is a huge market

14:23.710 --> 14:27.254
Did he die in England?

14:27.614 --> 14:28.195
Yeah.

14:28.275 --> 14:29.256
So he's buried in England.

14:29.316 --> 14:29.697
Yeah.

14:32.119 --> 14:36.464
I have been told the tombstone says he died of a broken heart.

14:36.925 --> 14:40.108
You said that, that's actually why I asked.

14:40.128 --> 14:40.809
Yeah.

14:40.949 --> 14:50.820
I think it's in a country graveyard, a church graveyard of a church that he was involved with.

14:51.621 --> 14:53.363
What has this material brought to you teaching?

14:54.541 --> 14:58.185
It's such a wonderful question.

14:58.225 --> 14:59.366
I'm not teaching anymore.

14:59.386 --> 15:00.147
I've retired.

15:00.547 --> 15:12.059
First of all, I did a whole session of this course on helping students understand the difference between reproductions and originals.

15:13.661 --> 15:22.270
The Pennsylvania Academy put out a device, a box with stuff, celebrating some anniversary or other.

15:22.672 --> 15:43.448
and if you didn't know the real thing you would be fooled so I would give that set of materials you know one piece of paper per person and ask them to look at it and smell it and feel it and then I would give them some of this stuff and you're never the same once you

15:44.069 --> 16:12.000
remember a long time ago morton when um i interviewed you about your parents or how you were educated when you were little a long time ago and i remember you telling me something that i never forgot about how you were told to go right up to the painting really close and to recognize the hand before you get distracted is do i is that correct

16:12.166 --> 16:13.187
Let's pause, correct.

16:13.387 --> 16:18.993
Of course, then people make mistakes and think that's the way you look at the picture.

16:19.013 --> 16:23.097
Yeah, but the notion of how do you know the material?

16:23.257 --> 16:25.720
How do you know it if you don't get close to it?

16:26.180 --> 16:26.661
That's true.

16:27.682 --> 16:33.247
So, I think I'll show you two more things, three more things.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.509
Well, I thought that you got people close to the material.

16:35.529 --> 16:36.831
Exactly, exactly.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.232
And then they started collecting.

16:38.252 --> 16:40.454
They probably ruined my market.

16:41.055 --> 16:42.156
She spawned a lot of collectors.

16:42.355 --> 16:49.905
But here's a wonderful thing in a totally different vein that I couldn't believe when I found it.

16:51.207 --> 16:54.271
These are Japanese pattern books.

16:55.273 --> 16:57.315
These are different kinds of seals.

16:57.956 --> 16:59.438
This is the whole story in itself.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.540
I went to Japan.

17:01.281 --> 17:04.946
This is not where I bought these, but I bought these actually in New Hampshire.

17:05.406 --> 17:10.253
But I found out that the Japanese are the great makers of

17:10.722 --> 17:39.733
drawing painting manuals because copying is so ancient and embedded in the culture but anyway so i stopped and looked at these two in new hampshire and on the inside it says compliments of arthur wesley dowell 1898 you see arthur wesley dowell was the big reformer of 20th century american art education to say nothing about his own wonderful art

17:40.372 --> 17:46.600
And he wrote a book called Composition at exactly the time that his books had dated.

17:47.221 --> 17:57.534
And his notion was that Americans being introduced to aesthetic expression, completely breaking with the industrial stuff from the 90s.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.616
I mean, it's really funny.

17:58.676 --> 18:01.920
It's just exactly changed the century and changed the aesthetic.

18:02.701 --> 18:03.882
So I was thrilled.

18:04.363 --> 18:07.527
You're probably the only person in America who would make that association, too.

18:08.131 --> 18:35.033
really that that's what you call a great association copy but who else would perceive that you know when you think about it some some would what i'm thrilled about about the huntington acquisition is that they know that and they're gonna they call me they say you are the text and they want me to come out there and talk about this stuff and get this you know i mean there are people who just

18:36.380 --> 18:36.761
Get it?

18:36.781 --> 18:39.124
And there are... Done.

18:39.645 --> 18:45.473
Okay, I'm going to... These are... What should I... I can't keep going like this.

18:45.533 --> 18:46.094
Too much stuff.

18:46.154 --> 18:48.438
I'm going to show you one great thing.

18:48.558 --> 18:50.040
They're early black plates.

18:50.060 --> 18:50.961
You want to see that?

18:52.604 --> 18:55.468
These are very interesting.

18:55.568 --> 19:01.517
And in that cabinet in the living room are the modern ones.

19:01.597 --> 19:03.079
Because these are still made.

19:03.717 --> 19:05.540
I don't understand what they are.

19:05.701 --> 19:07.143
Okay, here I'll show you.

19:07.243 --> 19:09.548
These are very fragile.

19:09.568 --> 19:10.309
Oh my.

19:12.754 --> 19:17.542
These are, this one is particularly so far, I know I wrapped it tightly.

19:17.562 --> 19:27.160
This is a wooden frame with a wooden back and a pivoting stick so that you could remove the back and

19:27.494 --> 19:30.098
see different wood engravings.

19:30.338 --> 19:32.421
There's a whole set of wood engravings back then.

19:32.442 --> 19:38.391
You could change them so you could trace on... These aren't like lantern slides.

19:38.471 --> 19:40.394
No, no, no.

19:40.414 --> 19:41.095
Much earlier.

19:41.135 --> 19:42.717
This is probably 1840.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.885
Here's a transparent slate.

19:47.945 --> 19:52.873
And they're all sort of grinchy because they drew on the graphite.

19:53.974 --> 19:56.438
I mean, they drew directly on the glass.

19:56.688 --> 19:58.631
Tracing everything?

19:59.632 --> 19:59.852
Yeah.

19:59.872 --> 20:02.596
And that was a very respected discipline.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.177
That's right.

20:03.197 --> 20:06.862
It's like an early light table, not the light.

20:07.002 --> 20:13.310
You know how designers now have portable tables and they have their image underneath the glass.

20:14.031 --> 20:17.055
They cross the glass on top and they put it right on it.

20:17.256 --> 20:20.620
It's actually very much like that process that's used now.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.524
It's almost like Dura's drawing process.

20:23.584 --> 20:26.588
The glass in the distance with the graph drawn on it.

20:26.608 --> 20:27.529
Oh really?

20:27.649 --> 20:30.653
The object on the other end of the table like a ping pong table.

20:31.073 --> 20:32.915
A glass graph.

20:34.538 --> 20:39.564
What do you call these again?

20:39.724 --> 20:40.345
Glass slate.

20:42.207 --> 20:42.608
Slate.

20:42.668 --> 20:45.291
S-L-A-T-E-S.

20:46.165 --> 20:56.735
And I was talking before about how much money was to be made in Artification Paracenalia, because every school had to have one and every evening drawing class had to have one.

20:56.775 --> 20:59.217
These are exquisitely made.

20:59.277 --> 21:01.359
The wood is just beautiful.

21:02.160 --> 21:13.610
And I like to use this as an example of how the quality of materials declined.

21:14.391 --> 21:15.852
These were...

21:16.017 --> 21:34.110
not so much later this was also a math art and museum school faculty members innovation this crummy little thing but these were the cheap replacement for these and um

21:34.411 --> 21:57.010
I'm going to show you one last thing, which is the last thing I bought, I think.

21:58.812 --> 22:00.034
Which is this box.

22:00.575 --> 22:06.082
We went to Grimfield one day, and I said, I'm not buying any more.

22:07.705 --> 22:15.135
And then I saw this box, and my sniffer was going.

22:15.155 --> 22:19.482
And this is a very wonderful thing to my mind.

22:20.523 --> 22:25.410
This was made in Scotland.

22:26.150 --> 22:52.917
I'm not going to go through the whole thing, but if you think of the growth of the schools in urban areas where people knew nothing about animals and vegetables and minerals, this was to enable a school child to understand the world that was no more.

22:53.673 --> 23:19.292
or was in the process this guy who sold me this sold it at the price of the box it still happens i mean this was about three or four years ago but i think these are such an education both on the origin of materials and of the aesthetic application

23:20.791 --> 23:32.904
I had a photographer come last week who is taking, has taken a picture of every full page with the text.

23:33.124 --> 23:34.646
So this is wonderful.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.207
Granite and marble.

23:36.528 --> 23:37.709
Where does it come from?

23:37.869 --> 23:39.231
How was it applied?

23:39.731 --> 23:40.933
Isn't that wonderful?

23:41.914 --> 23:43.195
Did you say this is American?

23:43.435 --> 23:49.802
It was used, what it says down here is Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, London, blah, blah, blah.

23:50.052 --> 23:58.861
And then, no, but importantly, Heinz Noble, agents for the United States.

23:58.901 --> 24:01.945
Magnificent.

24:01.965 --> 24:03.767
I don't want to handle it anymore.

24:03.787 --> 24:05.969
I think it is.

24:06.129 --> 24:06.950
Oh, what part?

24:06.970 --> 24:08.552
Look at that.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.793
Clay.

24:09.813 --> 24:13.837
The application.

24:14.018 --> 24:17.241
Look at that clay.

24:18.740 --> 24:21.285
You got that for the cost of the box.

24:21.305 --> 24:22.588
Yeah.

24:23.009 --> 24:24.832
Oh, God.

24:24.852 --> 24:25.854
Do you mind if we ask?

24:25.874 --> 24:30.003
$35.

24:30.925 --> 24:32.287
I never did anything.

24:32.568 --> 24:34.933
Except in my own childhood.

24:35.694 --> 24:37.137
We had objects.

24:37.370 --> 25:07.360
leather one a little bit where you had to bring in something and say where it grew or how it was made i remember i brought in a cotton bowl and i you know with the seeds in it you squeeze the cotton and they could feel those seeds but you know there must this was such a wonderful way to introduce children to oh absolutely it's so enticing yeah well and our gallery instructors carried things like this yes that's right

25:07.964 --> 25:10.207
That's right.

25:10.507 --> 25:15.653
Bill is the Education Chief at the Museum of Fine Arts.

25:15.673 --> 25:20.819
And I love that you do that, those hollered bags.

25:20.839 --> 25:24.223
But these are so beautifully composed.

25:24.283 --> 25:25.785
Yeah, yeah.

25:26.626 --> 25:32.493
And you can sort of see, they come out of the South Kensington School.

25:32.553 --> 25:35.136
You're the Education Chief at MFA.

25:35.740 --> 25:38.664
How do you judge something?

25:38.704 --> 25:41.928
How would you evaluate something like this?

25:42.169 --> 25:45.854
Oh, well, I don't think I'm capable of it.

25:45.894 --> 25:55.747
What I mean the connection of is seeing and touching that our gallery instructors, when they go in the galleries, kids can't touch different objects.

25:56.188 --> 26:04.920
When you were in the classical world, for example, so they share silk or they share granite or different marbles

26:05.086 --> 26:07.148
Oh, you can touch it.

26:07.168 --> 26:08.529
Oh, that's a good thing.

26:09.070 --> 26:11.252
And how joinery is done.

26:12.773 --> 26:14.455
Lots of stuff.

26:14.535 --> 26:16.096
Yeah, I forgot it was there.

26:16.136 --> 26:17.698
Do you want to describe it in such a way?

26:17.718 --> 26:22.182
The extent to which kids in the Boston Public Schools or others understand.

26:22.202 --> 26:24.264
I mean, language is difficult.

26:24.964 --> 26:29.088
We can deal with very concrete and abstract.

26:29.228 --> 26:33.492
But we also want to do a lot of different things so kids can excel and feel confident.

26:33.612 --> 26:34.553
So it's not, oh,

26:34.921 --> 27:03.510
have you ever seen anything like that i've not no no no no no this makes many more points yeah because it's also about the application a lot of the stuff was when you grow up you if you learn this you can do that so you would make ornamental pattern and anyway so what do you why do you feel when you discover something like that

27:04.283 --> 27:10.171
That's probably an understatement.

27:10.191 --> 27:11.753
It's a very strange process.

27:11.813 --> 27:14.016
I'm sure every collector has this feeling.

27:14.317 --> 27:19.123
It's as if you sniffed it before you found it, before you looked at it.

27:19.143 --> 27:20.605
I don't understand.

27:20.685 --> 27:26.433
Because there were hundreds of dealers there at Brimfield, that you should be drawn to this piece.

27:26.774 --> 27:30.038
Well, I love looking at stuff.

27:30.305 --> 27:58.995
i mean that if i didn't love it i wouldn't have found any the hunting is um i'm sure i'm saying things that are all too familiar to you but um i think you know to go back to the question you asked bill i think there are many many many children who need to learn in a different way than they do

27:59.735 --> 28:18.085
And I have recently actually, I'm sort of amused by this, so I've always felt that I had a certain kind of learning disability and a certain kind of learning extraordinariness.

28:18.465 --> 28:24.375
On both sides, I have very impatient with reading and endlessly interested in objects.

28:25.705 --> 28:35.118
And I actually had myself tested recently because I figure I'm old enough to find out what the truth is.

28:35.259 --> 28:38.924
And that there are a lot of people I found, but I'm dyslexic.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.506
Really?

28:40.786 --> 28:41.087
Yeah.

28:41.207 --> 28:44.051
And what's really incredible is to have written books.

28:44.892 --> 28:49.739
But I always, the secret is that I walk from object to object.

28:49.779 --> 28:51.021
I learn from the object.

28:51.473 --> 28:59.383
And then if I needed to understand something, I would go and find a book on that subject.

28:59.463 --> 29:01.025
But I wasn't a reader.

29:01.266 --> 29:04.330
And Andy is such a reader.

29:04.350 --> 29:06.773
He's reading all the time, all the time.

29:06.793 --> 29:10.418
And he's so disappointed that I can't share that.

29:10.478 --> 29:11.159
But I don't.

29:11.579 --> 29:13.442
I just don't enjoy it.

29:13.842 --> 29:16.265
But this does.

29:17.307 --> 29:21.312
So it has very big implications.

29:21.595 --> 29:25.941
this stuff for education today.

29:27.403 --> 29:34.012
And I hope this collection will actually influence that.

29:34.452 --> 29:42.703
My sister called the other day and she said, you know, the LA County Museum is just starting a big art education project.

29:42.723 --> 29:46.368
Do you know about that?

29:46.388 --> 29:51.315
With a variety of museums with very diverse objects.

29:51.447 --> 29:57.936
And, you know, there should be more ways to get at this.

29:58.697 --> 30:03.483
The Getty has been so dominant.

30:03.504 --> 30:07.309
And hopefully there'll be some other ways.

30:07.429 --> 30:11.174
I mean, that's a largely, the Getty approach is largely text-based.

30:12.816 --> 30:13.397
That's interesting.

30:13.417 --> 30:14.599
Telling, not looking.

30:16.722 --> 30:18.484
So there it is.

30:19.274 --> 30:47.104
i think so i think so the thing that makes me glad is how appreciative the curators and librarians seem to be at what this is uh the thing that's sad is that and it can't be anywhere this way but i'm having it all together is is such a richness what i've been able to do today

30:47.337 --> 31:15.387
now we're going to have an exhibit out there and they will be selected out there will be selected out there my um so you'll see some just some those who are there will see the juxtaposition that you've seen today but um and you've seen a very tiny part of them i've been thinking about the relationship of what you're showing us this afternoon to the um

31:16.548 --> 31:45.576
collection um focus that you put together in worcester some years ago for that show uh right right in fact that was the model well let me show you something that was the um american antiquarian society um well it was interesting because it was a you know it was an opportunity to frame yeah um theoretically the collection into

31:45.792 --> 32:15.495
uh then make a selection of ways in which it could be exhibited it would be a substantial very large exhibition that's mine yeah i just don't want to do that um some people uh well what i i have a an approach to this whole business which is um that a place should have it for whom

32:15.897 --> 32:25.086
the rest of the city, where the collection illuminates their interests and they can use it, not just because it looks like a neat thing to have.

32:26.067 --> 32:45.246
Anyway, Gigi Barnhill, who we were talking about the other day, who is a print curator at the American Antiquarian Society, she really courted me for the material of Drontart, and she knew exactly what it would mean there.

32:46.087 --> 33:12.803
um because their collection is a history of print and she was widening the definition as much as she could to include art as part of what they collect now so what i did was um say that they could have that material the artwork

33:13.897 --> 33:40.782
I gave them the print material they bought, that was kind of a, not half and half, very small part of the bind, was bind, but the terms, and that's what Nancy was saying before, the terms of the gift was that there would be an exhibit, a symposium, and a publication so that the collection would be identified and accessible to features.

33:41.335 --> 33:48.001
This is the book that has just come out, which is the symposium you were at.

33:49.302 --> 33:53.086
And I'm very pleased about this.

33:53.226 --> 33:55.789
And what I've done with Huntington is the same thing.

33:55.949 --> 34:05.277
I said, you can have this stuff if you'll do a grand exhibit and do a symposium and do a book.

34:05.297 --> 34:05.758
At the Huntington?

34:05.978 --> 34:07.520
Yep.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.081
And they agreed to that.

34:09.449 --> 34:37.718
uh pending pending that the quality of the papers weren't i mean i think it would be foolish you can pass around it would be foolish of them to say yes we'll publish for something i haven't seen but that that program of really focusing people's attention on the material bringing in um various people's interest to focus on this stuff and see what it is

34:38.508 --> 34:40.850
And it generates additional research.

34:41.171 --> 34:41.711
That's right.

34:41.791 --> 34:49.399
I mean, that's the best part of it, is that people come and they lift in and they put, you know, one-on-one together and they go home with five.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.341
Really.

34:51.601 --> 34:55.385
That's right.

34:56.426 --> 35:02.252
When was the exhibition in Worcester, roughly?

35:02.332 --> 35:03.553
Three or four years ago.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.122
Is that right, Nancy?

35:05.162 --> 35:05.763
You were there.

35:05.843 --> 35:06.944
Were you there, too?

35:07.125 --> 35:10.910
I know I went to one and heard the symposium, and I know it's different about this.

35:11.070 --> 35:12.713
It was wonderful.

35:13.374 --> 35:24.030
Every time I think something's two or three years ago, I know it could have to do with getting older, but it's definitely always more.

35:24.050 --> 35:31.661
Whenever I say it's three years ago, I'm down to that.

35:31.881 --> 35:33.844
How does I know it's not in three?

35:34.533 --> 35:40.981
I remember thinking that something happened, people asked me, 20 years ago.

35:41.963 --> 35:45.467
And then I kept them on 20 years ago.

35:45.768 --> 35:49.172
People asked me, 20 years what?

35:49.192 --> 35:50.133
That's wonderful.

35:51.014 --> 35:51.555
Yeah.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.862
This is such a treat, generally.

35:56.977 --> 35:59.681
I mean, I've watched a lot of them grow.

36:00.102 --> 36:01.844
Yeah, you've been in Grimfield with me.

36:01.864 --> 36:03.046
Yes, they have.

36:03.447 --> 36:05.069
Unless you've been on some of these finds, huh?

36:05.430 --> 36:06.191
Oh, yeah.

36:06.211 --> 36:08.274
And has made finds of her own.

36:09.876 --> 36:17.087
I started going to Grimfield, I think, when I was 12, with my aunt and uncle, and there were not very many people there, really.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.529
It was one field.

36:19.066 --> 36:20.848
Is that right?

36:20.868 --> 36:22.149
Yes, it was one field.

36:22.630 --> 36:35.764
I mean, it was one great big, it was large, but it was still considered a bigger thing around here, but it wasn't anything like what it's become.

36:36.004 --> 36:46.255
And there were occasionally, there were people who had small set-ups on the side of the road, but nothing like, you know, nothing.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.852
Do you still go now, Nancy?

36:48.053 --> 36:49.175
No, I don't.

36:49.275 --> 36:54.984
I'm just overwhelmed, I have to admit.

36:55.585 --> 36:58.409
It's a love-hate relationship, but it's overwhelming.

36:59.090 --> 37:01.715
I find it overwhelming.

37:02.997 --> 37:03.478
I too.

37:04.179 --> 37:08.766
I was coming back from Maine a couple of weeks ago.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.984
that on a whole strip of the road were just all one after another.

37:13.024 --> 37:13.645
Did you stop?

37:14.346 --> 37:14.586
No.

37:14.786 --> 37:15.447
I remember.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.650
There were too many other people, but it was very hard not to.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.471
They were good.

37:20.112 --> 37:25.238
There was one wall, and I mean, like, where are we going?

37:25.378 --> 37:28.541
Good stuff in front of those.

37:31.945 --> 37:38.432
You know, one of the things, let me think of how I want to say it.

37:38.969 --> 37:44.396
There's a certain time of life where you want stuff.

37:44.697 --> 37:47.200
And then there's the time when you move it away.

37:47.220 --> 37:58.516
You know, I remember my mother doing that about, not this kind of stuff, but I just think that's an interesting, you deal with that.

37:58.536 --> 38:04.925
There's a fellow in my book who says it's just as hard deaccessioning a collection properly as it is putting it together.

38:04.945 --> 38:06.647
I mean, making sure it goes to the right place.

38:06.965 --> 38:12.480
Toby Holtzman, yeah, making sure that the right people get it, precisely the kinds of things that you're doing.

38:14.947 --> 38:15.408
Wonderful.

38:17.674 --> 38:18.015
Thanks.

38:18.055 --> 38:20.923
So that's the story!

38:21.292 --> 38:24.176
See why I told you, it's hard to describe.

38:24.276 --> 38:27.620
We just chatted for the first half of the days ago.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.903
They just came back from Paris.

38:29.963 --> 38:31.625
Did you do the interview?

38:31.705 --> 38:35.030
Was that it?

38:35.190 --> 38:36.992
We would have.

38:37.112 --> 38:37.773
Well, we will.

38:37.833 --> 38:43.020
Actually, I've been doing a lot of the interviews.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.945
Or magazines, is that it?

38:47.262 --> 38:48.383
I'm sorry?

38:48.404 --> 38:50.106
Is it for a book or a magazine?

38:50.386 --> 38:51.488
Probably both.

38:51.688 --> 38:52.229
Both, uh-huh.

38:52.289 --> 38:52.629
Great.

38:55.473 --> 38:55.593
Great.

38:55.613 --> 38:59.278
You know, when I called you, that was very hard to do.

38:59.298 --> 39:00.299
I could tell.

39:01.000 --> 39:08.310
I could tell, because you left a message, and I could tell that it's not an easy... I have been so private about this.

39:08.410 --> 39:13.877
I'm looking at you and thinking, we've been in the same city, working around the same field,

39:14.144 --> 39:22.054
And you knew more, I don't know how, but I was very, very, very private about this.

39:23.416 --> 39:29.785
And then, of course, most of it just had to be piled together.

39:29.925 --> 39:33.650
It wasn't so easy to take out in my previous house.

39:33.670 --> 39:36.173
But anyway, I wish I'd shared it with you earlier.

39:36.213 --> 39:39.518
I wish we'd figured out a way to do something.

39:40.198 --> 39:41.400
And how long have you known each other?

39:41.819 --> 39:42.841
Yeah, many years.

39:42.861 --> 39:44.603
How long have you been in Boston?

39:44.683 --> 39:46.406
Who would do the 20-year thing again?

39:46.426 --> 39:48.710
I don't quite like that.

39:49.451 --> 39:50.332
Sixteen years.

39:50.352 --> 39:53.758
And this is the first you've known of the extent of this particular thing?

39:53.778 --> 39:54.799
The extent, absolutely.

39:56.402 --> 39:59.847
That's an interesting impact on situating.

40:00.829 --> 40:01.350
Yes.

40:02.371 --> 40:02.912
Yeah.

40:03.212 --> 40:04.795
She's a good scholar.

40:05.015 --> 40:10.003
And this is the woman who, as a curator at the NET,

40:11.063 --> 40:24.096
and prints and drawings, I guess, who worked on 15-length instructional experience with John Chaplin's drawing book.

40:24.537 --> 40:31.344
But you know, even if you didn't share it, but you were cataloging it in the sense that you knew you were going to share it.

40:31.664 --> 40:31.924
Yeah.

40:31.964 --> 40:34.307
I mean, I think the fact that you took such care to catalog it.

40:35.048 --> 40:35.588
Yeah.

40:35.608 --> 40:37.310
When you were writing it.

40:37.330 --> 40:37.510
Yeah.

40:39.616 --> 40:51.212
Would you say this is one of those synergistic collections where, you know, you talk about the value, the most you ever paid for a particular item was $250, but maybe most of them you paid $10 or $5 or $20, whatever.

40:51.552 --> 40:53.435
But this is one of those collections... Two.

40:53.455 --> 40:53.836
Whatever.

40:54.176 --> 40:57.621
But with a sum that's greater than the individual parts.

40:57.641 --> 40:58.542
Yeah, right.

40:58.602 --> 41:02.788
The true value is as a collection, not as individual parts.

41:02.908 --> 41:03.329
Absolutely.

41:03.689 --> 41:04.330
Absolutely.

41:04.350 --> 41:09.437
You know, among art collectors, there's a... or probably among...

41:09.653 --> 41:35.205
book people too the talk of should you let it go scattered to the winds again or keep it together when you have made a personal collection well it's a very I'm very intrigued by that question because look at the joy I had in putting it together and then it's together and it's out of circulation

41:35.810 --> 41:48.807
um except in this new mode of being the wonderful museum but um i guess i've just come to understand that each lifetime has certain opportunities

41:49.242 --> 42:18.861
and this was the opportunity of my moment and you know it's all gone it's all i mean and there are other things i mean furniture collectors say you can't find anything and you know i mean depending there are certain periods when there's uh not quite recognition yeah they're fine i think they're objects well they're they're funny and they're not quite seen

42:19.027 --> 42:20.569
Yet.

42:20.609 --> 42:21.270
That's important.

42:21.290 --> 42:22.071
Of all that time.

42:22.531 --> 42:24.013
Yeah, right.

42:24.033 --> 42:25.075
Well, of your time.

42:26.116 --> 42:26.817
Yeah, right.

42:26.877 --> 42:40.574
But the idea of cutting edge, you know, like, I'm trying to think of who that woman is, the name is Dayton, but another famous collector who always managed to be just at the, thinking of, you know, a certain thing before other people started to get a hold of them.

42:40.714 --> 42:41.034
Yeah.

42:41.194 --> 42:43.718
And that's really part of what it is.

42:43.738 --> 42:44.038
Yeah.

42:44.592 --> 43:06.685
before it's all gone for other reasons for other reasons other than the collectability of them yeah well i mean i'm thinking of the dispersal would mean perhaps the destruction of them depends if you build the understanding um i basically agree with you i'm very glad they're all going to be here

43:07.255 --> 43:14.524
My own personal view is that it would be criminal to break up this particular collection because it could never be done.

43:14.564 --> 43:19.109
And fortunately I've written a lot.

43:19.550 --> 43:28.200
The course that I created that I learned from these things is now a book.

43:28.653 --> 43:41.892
In addition to Drawn to Art, there's another book called Art Making and Education, which is written for a different audience than Drawn to Art.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.316
That's kindergarten stuff.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.139
Tell us what these things are.

43:46.159 --> 43:47.360
These are proebel.

43:47.661 --> 43:50.024
What did you call it again?

43:50.445 --> 43:52.468
F-R-O-E-B-E-L.

43:53.569 --> 43:55.993
Let me put this away and then I'll show you.

43:56.260 --> 44:06.291
Frederick Frobel was a genius who had a little trouble finding himself, but when he found himself he also found the kindergarten.

44:06.411 --> 44:21.728
And he had a tremendous respect for objects and for the way children learn from objects, and he

44:22.079 --> 44:25.424
developed these sets of different sized blocks.

44:25.444 --> 44:28.208
You know what I'm going to do that's better for you to see than these?

44:29.590 --> 44:33.495
These are all complex, different divisions.

44:33.636 --> 44:36.880
Have you seen these formal blocks?

44:37.942 --> 44:44.932
Diana, do you want me to put this top on or do you want to put it on?

44:44.952 --> 44:45.032
Yes.

44:45.299 --> 44:56.937
I think you're right.

44:57.618 --> 45:10.598
I want to just get it out of the way.

45:11.641 --> 45:20.293
You're from the museum, I can tell you.

45:20.313 --> 45:25.300
Anxiety here.

45:25.861 --> 45:27.984
Your excitement has to see the things.

45:28.004 --> 45:30.207
Putting it on a wobbly box.

45:31.449 --> 45:32.230
What a collection.

45:32.651 --> 45:37.197
Yeah, it is a wonderful collection.

45:37.217 --> 45:37.277
Ah.

45:38.557 --> 45:40.319
I haven't seen this.

45:40.339 --> 45:59.682
Fruggle was a mid-nineteenth-century person who made an enormous impact on American educators, particularly on Elizabeth Keabody.

46:01.685 --> 46:06.150
And she wrote, she called the kindergarten the art

46:06.603 --> 46:34.551
academy the children's art academy and this is a book that shows how to use these blocks and how to use kindergarten equipment let me see if i can just find something this sort of stuff they were called the gifts and occupations paper weaving um and uh when

46:34.750 --> 46:40.858
Someone aspired to be a kindergarten teacher.

46:41.739 --> 46:50.189
This is actually German, but this is the kind of... The discipline of the... I'll just show you one of these.

46:50.370 --> 46:52.472
This is the first slide.

46:53.213 --> 46:53.954
Oh, look at that.

46:53.974 --> 46:55.937
Paper weaving is unbelievable.

46:56.638 --> 47:03.306
These were required to be done by teachers, and I couldn't believe...

47:04.957 --> 47:07.040
that this was expected of children.

47:07.301 --> 47:15.473
But I have read recently that this very fine work was little tiny fingers.

47:17.616 --> 47:26.870
And the claim that you were learning math, that you were learning patterns, they're really amazing.

47:28.933 --> 47:33.360
And the blocks are another piece of that same,

47:33.661 --> 48:03.128
working from elements what oh yeah um you know when you think of what um children do in other cultures particularly in in more craft-based cultures you know where for example in third world countries where children are working with very very fine material whether they're doing working on rugs or whether they're working in weaving or dyeing or

48:03.428 --> 48:22.297
I mean, that you can really see, and in other countries, I think even of children working in Chinese painting, traditional Chinese painting, that they're doing this very, very, very same, very fine work at a level that we don't even consider.

48:22.337 --> 48:25.802
Don't believe in expectations of children.

48:25.822 --> 48:29.588
So we could have set a developmental course.

48:30.158 --> 48:55.542
that is self-fulfilling that's right that's right that's right and you certainly see it in other education yeah yeah absolutely true when um i was thinking before you came about how to explain how this whole thing happened and um it was that i got very angry at current art ideas

48:56.247 --> 49:25.849
and the rigidity and doctrinaire ways we say you do this you don't do this and nancy and i both came out of training in art child development and there were all these assumptions that art was the way it was because of the organic makeup of the child well it turns out it was the culture big surprise and um

49:26.335 --> 49:28.258
You can trace the changes.

49:29.980 --> 49:31.062
Now it's the genes.

49:31.082 --> 49:33.245
Now it's the genes.

49:33.446 --> 49:34.868
This is the old nature nurtures.

49:35.649 --> 49:36.971
Going back and forth, yeah.

49:38.153 --> 49:41.217
Well... Thank you.

49:41.377 --> 49:42.900
I'm glad you could all come.

49:42.920 --> 49:47.066
I'm not a professional, but you know, seeing this... Oh, I want it.

49:47.086 --> 49:48.829
Thank you very much to be here.

49:49.049 --> 49:51.853
Well, you have succeeded in...

49:52.137 --> 49:53.819
for the quest that we're making now.

49:53.999 --> 49:56.542
Yeah, I wanted to know where you are.

49:56.602 --> 49:59.525
Tell them what you are trying to do.

49:59.545 --> 50:03.329
I mean, what you are doing and what your aim is in getting a home for this.

50:04.230 --> 50:09.677
Well, to me, you probably don't know what we've been doing.

50:09.697 --> 50:18.867
For some years now, we've been working on a, originally it was a project for a dictionary of American painters born before 1900.

50:20.328 --> 50:20.929
I had

50:23.120 --> 50:29.729
Well, it started when I joined my father after I got to college in the Rose Galleries.

50:31.091 --> 50:31.592
I was 31.

50:31.752 --> 50:36.879
And I immediately began to see signatures on paintings.

50:37.019 --> 50:38.501
I couldn't find them listed anywhere.

50:38.541 --> 50:44.910
And of course, I would do some investigations just for my own purposes and keep notes.

50:45.671 --> 50:48.435
But as it went along,

50:49.377 --> 50:55.382
five or six years of memoir, I began to think that perhaps what was accumulating might become something sometimes.

50:56.143 --> 51:19.283
Well, well, during the 45 years I was there, and 13 years that Ruth was there after our kids had flown somewhat, there was no time, except to, well, on business travels, I would usually try to steal a Sunday or something to look at historical societies, museums, all around the country.

51:20.191 --> 51:25.818
And we did assemble a really considerable amount of material.

51:26.559 --> 51:32.446
And as I say, when we retired, we decided that this was the time.

51:33.868 --> 51:36.011
That was quite a few years ago now.

51:36.031 --> 51:47.245
Had we started to assemble small staff, and eventually when you added

51:48.693 --> 51:51.897
volunteers and interns and so forth.

51:51.917 --> 51:55.482
We at one time had about 10 folks working with us.

51:56.943 --> 52:18.210
That hasn't continued because we found eventually we could have supported ourselves and it has for some years been supported by grants from various foundations and from even interested individuals.

52:20.249 --> 52:28.518
Foundations are, I think, quite properly more interested nowadays, much more interested in social concerns than they are in this sort of thing.

52:29.118 --> 52:30.280
So it hasn't been very easy.

52:31.681 --> 52:40.010
On the other hand, the size of the database for this has grown way out of my imagination.

52:40.571 --> 52:43.894
I should have been.

52:48.346 --> 52:51.370
It's up in the opinion of 10,000 to 20,000 entries.

52:52.231 --> 53:00.440
We are now fiddling with 50,000, 54,000 or something, identified painters.

53:02.222 --> 53:05.286
Now, this is American.

53:05.486 --> 53:07.068
This is all American.

53:07.709 --> 53:09.771
This is all American.

53:09.811 --> 53:17.160
Foreigners who came and worked here did significant work, even though they might have retired later back to Europe or somewhere.

53:17.460 --> 53:18.201
We do include

53:19.278 --> 53:32.993
And, of course, by no means, anyway, all of those are already completely edited and researched, but they've been identified, and we're also getting them onto disks.

53:33.013 --> 53:38.539
They're originally a Godfather, originally, and that's my part of it.

53:39.420 --> 53:46.888
I am computer ignorant, but we have, our son is the computer

53:47.594 --> 53:50.198
curator, you might say, and then we have several others.

53:51.380 --> 54:02.856
But, the reason I was mentioning this was because our time has come when we don't do something such as Nancy's... Diana has done.

54:04.619 --> 54:15.795
We have decided that we had better pull up steaks and go to retirement home before our kids have to drag us there.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.436
We are not 18 anymore.

54:19.798 --> 54:25.426
So we are very regretfully selling our home, Brookline, which was the headquarters.

54:25.806 --> 54:38.763
It was a house big enough for us to live in, and also to have a computer room, file room, and so forth and so on, and another floor for a library.

54:40.145 --> 54:41.127
And that all has to get out.

54:42.468 --> 54:43.690
So we are searching.

54:44.210 --> 54:52.480
or a repository, and I don't see, in my lifetime at least, any publication, considering the sizes of things.

54:52.500 --> 54:57.265
But the database, of course, is something that should be very useful.

54:58.547 --> 55:00.289
And we've tried a number of places.

55:01.050 --> 55:01.470
I can vouch for that.

55:01.490 --> 55:02.632
I can vouch for that.

55:02.952 --> 55:07.838
I was recently, well, not so recently, up in New Hampshire, and I found a beautiful painting.

55:08.290 --> 55:09.691
And what do you do?

55:09.892 --> 55:13.255
You call Morton, and there was a signature.

55:13.395 --> 55:15.917
I called you and I said, does this mean anything to you?

55:16.318 --> 55:19.601
And you called it up and you had a whole story about this person.

55:20.282 --> 55:23.225
It's phenomenal what they have done.

55:23.245 --> 55:24.666
There's a quality not always.

55:24.686 --> 55:27.589
50,000 or so.

55:27.729 --> 55:34.956
Well, we do have inquiries almost every week.

55:35.560 --> 55:38.364
And people say, well, why don't you charge for that?

55:38.425 --> 55:45.676
But nothing doing, because in the first place, we get often as much as we give.

55:46.858 --> 55:55.051
For instance, just to put a very simple way, suppose someone says, well, I know this artist this day, but don't know his death day.

55:55.111 --> 55:57.755
Maybe the other way around with us.

55:57.775 --> 55:59.758
We have learned something as well as giving.

56:00.279 --> 56:03.424
But the rest of us send out letters now and then.

56:03.674 --> 56:11.167
No, I don't think you should call my contact at Huntington's.

56:13.331 --> 56:18.240
Because they have just started this American Museum.

56:18.260 --> 56:18.941
Wow.

56:18.961 --> 56:23.108
And they might be thrilled to have this be housed with that.

56:23.829 --> 56:25.973
Well, yes, it's been suggested, of course.

56:25.993 --> 56:28.197
There are places like Metropole.

56:28.970 --> 56:33.695
National Gallery has expressed some interest.

56:33.875 --> 56:37.479
But there's something else about that.

56:38.059 --> 56:45.427
The point is that I very much hope that it can be in the Boston area, because I would like to keep on working as long as I can on it.

56:46.047 --> 56:51.573
And if we can find a place that, well, for instance, an example of the Boston Epineum.

56:52.153 --> 56:54.876
We did try that without any luck, because I had no room.

56:55.109 --> 56:58.073
I thought they were expanding.

56:58.733 --> 57:00.415
I thought they were expanding.

57:00.435 --> 57:01.557
They are expanding.

57:01.577 --> 57:04.420
They are expanding some, but not enough.

57:04.480 --> 57:05.862
Not enough for us.

57:06.062 --> 57:12.029
We have tried several other places.

57:12.750 --> 57:14.893
That was our first choice.

57:15.373 --> 57:21.401
But they have so little money that they said they just couldn't do anything with it.

57:22.182 --> 57:25.065
The FNAF does have a new director there.

57:25.535 --> 57:28.138
They have a new director of the acting, Richard Wendt.

57:28.158 --> 57:29.100
Oh, I know.

57:29.600 --> 57:38.071
Well, Rodney is a close personal friend, and we thought we had a very good chance, but Rodney listened to us carefully.

57:38.131 --> 57:39.233
I'll never forget the meeting.

57:39.273 --> 57:47.343
We had a little action committee of the trustees, and we met with them.

57:48.525 --> 57:54.012
Rodney obviously had asked John Lennon to carry the ball.

57:54.132 --> 57:54.833
Rodney sat and

57:55.657 --> 57:58.099
Look, Rodney-ish.

57:58.660 --> 58:03.024
John asked us questions, so forth and so on.

58:03.064 --> 58:07.708
Rodney finally said, Morten, I'm afraid we can't help you.

58:08.349 --> 58:08.969
Let's go to lunch.

58:11.331 --> 58:12.993
Which we did.

58:13.633 --> 58:17.917
But this has been our experience in two other places.

58:18.738 --> 58:24.263
And we are now, I think, with some hope of trying another one.

58:24.833 --> 58:31.739
developed at the moment, but Diana will hear about it because she'll be at the meeting later on.

58:33.501 --> 58:44.330
So that's what, why I sort of hope we might have it nearby, so that we could have a place to leave the physical.

58:45.631 --> 58:47.673
That's the immediate problem.

58:47.693 --> 58:48.694
Before the moon.

58:49.074 --> 58:54.199
Because people today are looking at our house by a way away.

58:54.415 --> 59:03.167
Do you have images of all the signatures, or many of the signatures too, or is it strictly biographical information?

59:03.388 --> 59:04.509
Biographical.

59:04.529 --> 59:05.591
Oh, yes, we're trying to.

59:05.711 --> 59:08.355
But you have images of the actual artist's signatures as well?

59:08.415 --> 59:13.823
No, no, no, we haven't.

59:13.883 --> 59:15.064
That would be wonderful, of course.

59:15.225 --> 59:17.227
It's not been done, as you know, in some cases.

59:17.388 --> 59:18.129
Yeah.

59:18.169 --> 59:22.515
But we have enough how our play is about .

59:23.947 --> 59:30.357
No, it's been a lot of fun and a little bit of frustration.

59:30.417 --> 59:31.959
Oh, what a gift that is.

59:31.979 --> 59:37.728
According to our by-laws, we have to give it to another 501c3.

59:38.509 --> 59:42.135
We are a not-for-profit corporation.

59:42.175 --> 59:43.437
What's the name of the corporation?

59:43.737 --> 59:50.006
Well, just because I've done it, it's Bo's Archive, no S on the end, Bo's Archive.

59:50.607 --> 59:51.709
Inc.

59:51.824 --> 01:00:00.013
How would you tell yourself?

01:00:01.234 --> 01:00:05.018
Well, I certainly understand your wishing it to stay in Boston.

01:00:05.699 --> 01:00:06.600
I hope so.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.961
To work with it.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:12.846
I mean, the nature of computer material is that you could be anywhere.

01:00:13.367 --> 01:00:13.707
Yes.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:19.333
But I understand the attachment to...

01:00:20.123 --> 01:00:22.646
And you're not doing the computer piece.

01:00:22.666 --> 01:00:23.507
That's the other thing.

01:00:23.627 --> 01:00:27.772
It wouldn't matter where it was, except the piece you were doing.

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:31.095
Oh, Santa Claus does that computer all the time.

01:00:31.656 --> 01:00:32.617
Nancy Peabody.

01:00:32.677 --> 01:00:35.200
Yeah, Nancy Peabody.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.442
Project Director.

01:00:37.482 --> 01:00:39.224
Yeah.

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:46.653
That's the way we sit, and I say, maybe you have landed.

01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:48.915
You know, I...

01:00:49.385 --> 01:00:51.179
And me, me too.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.538
Because it doesn't have to come out that way.

01:00:53.982 --> 01:00:54.062
Wow.
