WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:03.243
Okay, go ahead.

00:03.263 --> 00:04.425
The third one.

00:05.988 --> 00:10.535
He's the first person to create a non-Roman form of Christianity.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.461
Now, you've told me that you're Greek.

00:14.541 --> 00:27.482
I mean, you realize that whether it was Rome in the sense of the Latin West or Constantinople in the Greek East, they were all Romans.

00:27.502 --> 00:29.886
They saw themselves as citizens of the Roman Empire.

00:30.170 --> 00:33.233
There was the Latin Empire and there was the Greek Empire.

00:34.093 --> 00:46.824
But beyond both of those, the first enculturation that we are aware of outside of the Empire is Patricks.

00:46.844 --> 00:56.912
He is the first person who has to figure out how to build Christianity or plant Christianity in a non-Roman culture.

00:58.974 --> 01:00.075
And the way he did it

01:01.287 --> 01:05.031
shows, I think, his immense creativity.

01:05.731 --> 01:11.517
He didn't try to bring all the Roman trappings with him.

01:11.537 --> 01:29.455
He reduced Christianity once again to the Gospel and planted it in Ireland, and what blossomed was a much more freewheeling, diverse, purposefully diverse Christianity than the Romans would ever have allowed.

01:30.346 --> 01:36.373
Would you describe this book as a labor of love for you?

01:36.453 --> 01:38.815
Give me a little bit of your biographical.

01:38.915 --> 01:43.480
I mean, your surname certainly suggests a vested interest in the subject.

01:43.601 --> 01:46.283
Well, all my grandparents were Irish-born.

01:46.303 --> 01:50.588
They were all immigrants to this country.

01:50.909 --> 01:51.890
I only knew one of them.

01:52.390 --> 01:54.092
Three of them died before I was born.

01:55.287 --> 01:58.230
I'm hanging out with a precise situation.

01:58.830 --> 02:01.092
Four grandparents from Greece, and I only knew one.

02:01.172 --> 02:03.915
But what's interesting is the great melting pot.

02:05.496 --> 02:10.821
Which leaves you sort of feeling as if something's been left out.

02:10.841 --> 02:15.305
There's a link missing there that you'd like to know about.

02:15.465 --> 02:18.147
I can't even explain it, but from the time I was a little kid.

02:18.408 --> 02:19.408
Growing up where, by the way?

02:19.709 --> 02:20.409
In the Bronx.

02:20.429 --> 02:21.490
Okay, so you're a New Yorker.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.472
Right.

02:24.970 --> 02:48.618
From the time I was a little kid, I always felt... My mother, whom I mentioned, she's now dead, used to tell these stories and sing these songs that had been taught to her by her mother, whom I never knew, who was from Galway.

02:49.078 --> 02:53.003
And...

02:53.894 --> 03:03.965
I was always, they always held an immense fascination for me, which I wouldn't even try to explain.

03:04.025 --> 03:07.249
Even now, when I think of some of those things, I can hardly talk.

03:10.192 --> 03:10.753
A big way.

03:11.994 --> 03:19.362
I just feel overcome.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.997
Was a sense of your Irishness passed on to you by your parents?

03:25.758 --> 03:30.807
I suppose, but I don't think they would, you know, they didn't, they were not, it wasn't of the green beer variety.

03:30.827 --> 03:31.969
I was going to say, what did you do on St.

03:31.989 --> 03:32.670
Patrick's Day?

03:33.251 --> 03:35.595
Not necessarily all that much.

03:35.635 --> 03:36.677
It wasn't a St.

03:36.697 --> 03:37.719
Patrick's Day thing.

03:38.280 --> 03:43.088
It was much more, what I remember are these stories and songs and sayings.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.047
It was more of an intellectual appreciation, shall we say.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.068
No, I'm not even sure.

03:48.209 --> 03:49.371
I wouldn't say it was intellectual.

03:49.391 --> 03:51.875
It was extremely heartfelt.

03:51.895 --> 03:59.587
Intellectual would do quite, but it was enveloping, and it grabbed you.

04:02.131 --> 04:09.784
And it was almost like an alternative scripture or a...

04:15.063 --> 04:16.265
Yeah.

04:16.285 --> 04:17.827
Okay, you went to Fordham, I guess?

04:18.168 --> 04:18.548
Is that right?

04:18.749 --> 04:19.029
I did.

04:19.209 --> 04:24.918
I'm deducing that from all the Fordham brothers that you mentioned.

04:25.218 --> 04:33.371
Yeah, I was fortunate enough to be educated by Jesuits at a time when they still insisted that everybody read Latin and Greek.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.295
Too bad they still don't.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.821
Well, I think so.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.908
I mean, I think they gave up just when they... Oh, I'm a hardliner.

04:41.988 --> 04:43.310
Did you read Harold Bloom's book?

04:43.851 --> 04:43.991
Uh-huh.

04:44.252 --> 04:46.515
I mean, there's a lot in there to agree with.

04:46.595 --> 04:51.383
I'm not asking for a comment on it, but I really... Anyway, go ahead.

04:51.403 --> 04:52.244
I'm sorry.

04:52.304 --> 04:55.870
No, I think that we've made terrible mistakes in this regard.

04:56.677 --> 04:58.680
I'm all for multiculturalism.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.306
In fact, I think that my book is a form of multiculturalism.

05:02.326 --> 05:05.071
It's insisting that the Irish have been left out.

05:07.435 --> 05:14.066
On an earlier radio program, somebody said, well, of course you mean that they saved Western civilization, not civilization.

05:14.086 --> 05:14.567
Oh, great.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.953
And I said, well, no, actually I mean they saved civilization.

05:18.013 --> 05:21.098
It's not like civilization is a choice.

05:21.078 --> 05:50.055
it's not as if you know it's a smorgasbord and we pass by and we say i think i'll have a little chinese civilization and i think i'll have a little um a little uh saudi arabian civilization and you know we the only civilization that we can be a part of is western civilization so it is civilization for us uh that doesn't mean that there can't be new ingredients there always are new ingredients but still it's one uh plant

05:50.693 --> 05:58.183
And so as far as the Irish were concerned, they saved civilization.

05:58.203 --> 06:04.772
They saved the only civilization there was or that could be called by that name in that time and that place.

06:05.212 --> 06:05.933
By those people.

06:07.215 --> 06:12.903
Yeah, but you know, it's still, you can't, but if you think about it, civilization is not a choice.

06:13.003 --> 06:16.007
It's not like deciding what kind of clothes you're going to wear.

06:18.750 --> 06:19.992
It's not something to be,

06:21.085 --> 06:24.515
to be put on and taken off at will.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.909
It goes much more deeply than that.

06:28.929 --> 06:30.393
Did that satisfy the questioner?

06:30.433 --> 06:31.416
Of course not.

06:36.357 --> 06:44.328
Multiculturalism can bring its own form of blindness.

06:44.348 --> 06:44.748
Go ahead.

06:45.029 --> 06:45.650
Continue, sir.

06:46.431 --> 06:46.711
That's it.

06:46.751 --> 06:47.472
I don't know.

06:47.492 --> 06:48.714
I don't have much more than that.

06:48.774 --> 06:49.575
Okay.

06:49.595 --> 06:59.108
We were talking again about your own... And looking at the books, the other books that you've done, there does seem to be a preponderance of effort.

06:59.780 --> 07:04.089
to your Irish heritage, your interest certainly in Irish literature.

07:04.169 --> 07:05.412
Well, I'm doing the Jews next.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.614
Are you?

07:06.634 --> 07:07.256
Yes.

07:07.276 --> 07:10.823
I just finished a proposal for a book to be called The Gifts of the Jews.

07:11.024 --> 07:13.269
They have a Jew-safe civilization.

07:13.669 --> 07:14.291
Exactly.

07:14.331 --> 07:15.854
That's all my Jewish friends.

07:16.836 --> 07:19.662
I'm going from the... I'm going to take...

07:20.401 --> 07:23.173
I'm going to take care of the genes.

07:23.193 --> 07:23.755
That would work.

07:23.775 --> 07:24.418
That would work.

07:25.181 --> 07:30.985
You know, I handled in the course of the research for my book, you talk about

07:32.618 --> 07:34.842
Christianity being 500 years old.

07:35.703 --> 07:45.318
One of the people I profile in my book is William Scheide out in Princeton, New Jersey, who has arguably the finest library of private hands in North America.

07:46.440 --> 07:53.952
He's the only individual who owns a Gutenberg Bible, which I handle, which was a kick.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.960
But he went to his safe and brought out this 5th century codex.

07:58.961 --> 07:59.362
Really?

07:59.382 --> 08:02.188
In Coptic, and it is a complete Gospel of Matthew.

08:03.470 --> 08:03.550
Wow.

08:03.570 --> 08:07.738
And I think it's, you know, among the fourth oldest surviving sources.

08:08.107 --> 08:09.809
of the Gospel of Matthew.

08:10.269 --> 08:12.472
Imagine that, and it's in Coptic, and he went through it.

08:13.073 --> 08:13.713
I described this.

08:14.294 --> 08:20.841
In fact, it's in its original binding of beveled wooden boards with still some of the original leather.

08:21.182 --> 08:22.403
Yeah, amazing.

08:22.443 --> 08:36.679
The Copts, actually, I left out the Ethiopians out of all this because I wasn't quite sure how to bring them in, but like Ireland, Ethiopia is a non-Roman

08:38.228 --> 08:43.155
culture onto which Christianity is grafted.

08:43.235 --> 08:44.857
Now, it's different in many ways.

08:44.937 --> 08:47.881
It had a lot of ties to the Jews.

08:49.583 --> 08:56.593
And so it was kind of part of, you could almost say it was part of Mediterranean culture.

08:56.733 --> 09:02.481
It's not quite as wild and crazy as trying to graft Christianity onto Ireland.

09:03.507 --> 09:13.109
But there are still some, there are many interesting parallels, and I would love to study that sometime.

09:13.209 --> 09:15.114
I don't know Copped, but I'd love to learn.

09:15.775 --> 09:18.381
It looks a lot like Greek, actually.

09:18.502 --> 09:21.769
Yeah, I imagine that it is similar in certain ways.

09:22.205 --> 09:27.977
And I think that the parallels might be interesting.

09:29.480 --> 09:29.580
Yeah.

09:29.600 --> 09:36.554
But the odd thing about the cops is that we have no name of an apostle.

09:37.436 --> 09:38.237
We don't know who did it.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.422
Yeah.

09:40.522 --> 09:43.167
I just called up on my computer the page.

09:43.535 --> 09:52.069
And he's describing, we go to the colophon of this codex, and he says, imagine that is an M right there, and take my word for it if you try hard.

09:52.610 --> 09:58.159
The letter next to it is an A. And then this circle with a little line through it, that's a theta, which means th.

09:59.021 --> 10:03.608
Then there's an A-I-O, and that C would be used as an S. I'm just quoting Mr. Scheider here.

10:04.390 --> 10:06.733
So what that means is Matthäus, Matthew, you see.

10:06.753 --> 10:10.099
And before that comes the word kata, which means according to Matthew.

10:10.282 --> 10:15.689
And this word up here is the word for gospel, evangelion, the evangel, where the word evangelist comes from.

10:15.709 --> 10:20.334
So what you have here is a complete 5th century Coptic man, and we're handling this, you know.

10:20.775 --> 10:22.116
That's Greek, what you're just saying.

10:22.136 --> 10:22.957
That's exactly right.

10:23.338 --> 10:25.380
That's what he's showing me, and he's reading it to me, you know.

10:26.762 --> 10:29.685
And as we were talking, he called it up on the computer.

10:30.206 --> 10:32.689
But anyway, you know, I'm hopeful.

10:32.769 --> 10:35.192
We're going now to...

10:35.594 --> 10:40.565
I just closed on the galleys two weeks ago in my book, and I'm getting the bound galleys.

10:40.645 --> 10:41.166
I don't know when.

10:41.186 --> 10:41.888
I don't know how long.

10:41.928 --> 10:44.153
What's the turnaround to urine publishing?

10:44.173 --> 10:52.150
If we closed the galleys on the 17th of February, normally when would you expect to see bound galleys?

10:52.170 --> 10:53.974
A month after that probably?

10:54.983 --> 10:55.524
two months?

10:55.984 --> 10:56.625
No, no, a month.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.087
Something more like a month.

10:58.147 --> 10:58.368
Yeah.

10:58.988 --> 11:00.290
Well, I still have one more.

11:00.430 --> 11:04.075
I'd like to, you know, I don't know, maybe I can get a footnote in here.

11:04.095 --> 11:05.177
I would like to credit your book.

11:05.958 --> 11:13.348
I'm advertising my book as, unlike your book, which you don't go in for a large bibliography.

11:13.809 --> 11:15.671
You might just address yourself to that briefly.

11:15.731 --> 11:16.632
Why?

11:17.053 --> 11:17.193
Yeah.

11:17.634 --> 11:19.076
I love bibliographies.

11:19.156 --> 11:22.240
I said why, because I can never figure out what

11:22.372 --> 11:23.833
was really useful to someone.

11:23.873 --> 11:27.176
I read an awful lot more, needless to say, than the intention.

11:27.196 --> 11:27.997
I'd have to have.

11:28.037 --> 11:29.659
I couldn't possibly have done it any other way.

11:30.619 --> 11:34.663
But an awful lot of what you read, you don't find useful.

11:35.144 --> 11:38.667
It's only the few little nuggets that you really find useful.

11:39.107 --> 11:50.117
So I just thought that for a book of this kind, which is not a scholarly book, but based on other people's scholarship, I would limit myself to the things that I really did find useful.

11:51.076 --> 12:01.228
Plain why I found them useful, so that a reader, especially I think an uninitiated reader, might actually use some of them.

12:01.748 --> 12:13.422
A woman here who read the bound galleys, somebody from the international division said, I want to tell you that I'm reading the Aeneid, and that's thanks to your book.

12:13.462 --> 12:15.885
It never occurred to me to try it before.

12:17.047 --> 12:18.469
So much for liberal education.

12:19.010 --> 12:21.073
Well, I was very happy to hear that.

12:21.093 --> 12:23.596
I really felt I had succeeded with something.

12:23.616 --> 12:27.962
That's exactly the kind of thing I would like to do.

12:28.262 --> 12:33.309
I would love that this book lead every reader to at least one other book.

12:33.870 --> 12:36.133
And I don't particularly care what the other book is.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.235
Good quote, good quote.

12:37.255 --> 12:37.695
I like that.

12:38.356 --> 12:40.239
I'm looking for my sound bites here.

12:40.479 --> 12:40.940
Oh, all right.

12:41.481 --> 12:41.921
That's good.

12:43.543 --> 12:46.227
And so it's with that in mind...

12:46.831 --> 12:48.593
that I limited the bibliography.

12:49.914 --> 12:56.820
Well, you said just a few minutes ago that you did not perceive this, and you do not perceive this as a scholarly book.

12:56.900 --> 13:01.565
So your target audience then is the general reader, right?

13:01.585 --> 13:02.145
My assumption.

13:02.285 --> 13:03.486
I really have that in mind.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.769
There certainly are assertions in here that are original.

13:08.731 --> 13:12.054
All the stuff I just said about Patrick, I have never seen anybody else say.

13:13.075 --> 13:16.298
I think it's all...

13:16.700 --> 13:22.729
extremely defensible from the remaining text, but nobody else has ever said it.

13:23.009 --> 13:36.750
And I've never seen anywhere the claim that he was the first person to condemn slavery, but all you have to do is read

13:37.439 --> 13:40.282
his letters to Carotacus to know that he did.

13:41.003 --> 13:41.103
Yeah.

13:42.184 --> 13:44.386
But no one has ever thought of it in that context.

13:44.707 --> 13:47.590
I'm just so scared when you say the first and the only.

13:48.771 --> 13:54.517
There's going to be somebody out there that's going to come up with, you know, just my... I'm waiting.

13:54.618 --> 13:57.360
I wish you'd have couched it just to... I'm waiting.

13:57.381 --> 13:59.082
Hedged it a tad, you know.

13:59.102 --> 14:05.269
I don't, you know, I do know a lot about this period, and I, you know, I am a sort of...

14:05.485 --> 14:12.933
amateur student of history, and I think, I don't think anybody's going to come up with anything.

14:12.953 --> 14:13.574
That's great.

14:13.594 --> 14:15.316
That actually means anything.

14:15.336 --> 14:16.237
What's the first printing?

14:17.338 --> 14:17.999
You mean how many?

14:18.159 --> 14:18.300
Yeah.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.222
Well, I think we're in our third printing.

14:20.262 --> 14:21.283
We're up to about 25,000.

14:21.563 --> 14:22.004
Really?

14:22.665 --> 14:23.285
Good for you.

14:23.526 --> 14:25.268
I mean, you're two weeks away from pub date.

14:25.828 --> 14:26.028
Right.

14:26.929 --> 14:27.590
I'm just looking.

14:27.670 --> 14:28.812
Yeah, mine's a first edition.

14:28.872 --> 14:29.232
Good.

14:30.697 --> 14:32.099
I care about these things.

14:32.119 --> 14:36.444
I have to go because I have another... Well, we did fine.

14:36.464 --> 14:38.667
I have another thing downtown.

14:39.188 --> 14:41.010
Well, give me your phone number, will you, Case?

14:41.450 --> 14:41.591
Please.

14:41.611 --> 14:42.532
Will you give me your phone number?

14:42.552 --> 14:43.373
212.

14:43.873 --> 14:45.315
Let me just... Okay, 212.

14:45.335 --> 14:45.836
782-9762.

14:45.916 --> 14:48.419
9762.

14:48.719 --> 14:52.384
Okay, good.

14:52.735 --> 14:54.579
I review often for the L.A.

14:54.599 --> 14:55.501
Times.

14:55.661 --> 14:56.583
I used to review a lot.

14:56.623 --> 14:57.484
I don't do as much now.

14:57.525 --> 14:58.186
I don't have the time.

14:58.206 --> 15:01.533
But I would really like to see your book with a view toward that.

15:01.733 --> 15:02.515
That would be wonderful.

15:02.715 --> 15:04.238
I have a whole California channel.

15:04.258 --> 15:05.260
I'm going to shut up for tape recording.
