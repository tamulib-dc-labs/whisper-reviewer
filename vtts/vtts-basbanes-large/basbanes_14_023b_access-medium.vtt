WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:30.609
The idea of total cleansing of the lands, including all Bosnia and two-thirds of the Croatia, with the total loss of 300,000 soldiers, that is general maintenance of Serbian action.

00:30.629 --> 00:32.451
At this point they did not succeed.

00:33.477 --> 00:38.344
pushing to do domestic things in my land, but they did not succeed.

00:39.846 --> 00:45.333
Now, upon the other generation, how do we view the advantages?

00:45.353 --> 00:47.075
That maybe we have a fresh start.

00:48.537 --> 00:51.401
Maybe it's not ridiculous, but we have a fresh start.

00:55.226 --> 00:58.911
To develop some kind of sustainable society.

00:59.515 --> 01:08.805
both economic and both political.

01:09.165 --> 01:12.869
It will be the tricky area in terms of our politics.

01:12.889 --> 01:17.514
It will be under pressure.

01:17.534 --> 01:24.141
Every time you could, when one knew that your sector, or believe me, is not talking to our politicians.

01:24.161 --> 01:27.865
He is doing something to achieve.

01:27.885 --> 01:28.746
I hope that he will come quite often to St.

01:28.766 --> 01:29.387
George and the crew, of course,

01:30.262 --> 01:37.452
We will be thinking earlier for the investment.

01:37.472 --> 01:59.441
Because there is no way that anyone will allow us to be wired and to help the army that is still 50% of our world-class national border and no way that anyone will support us if we are not what we really are.

01:59.461 --> 01:59.982
I think it's just a normal

02:00.350 --> 02:28.686
I was actually trying to have much more anger than the third and fourth and fourth.

02:29.408 --> 02:41.885
Well, you know, you meet that soldier on the line in general, you're actually absolutely mortified, shocked, surprised.

02:41.905 --> 02:53.340
And they don't have to, first of all, have to tie the game, and second of all, so surprised you can't comprehend the people they knew about town to survive and go to Belgrade for a vacation.

02:54.282 --> 03:18.071
There's anger that comes from looking at it more.

03:18.091 --> 03:18.552
It builds in your life.

03:18.572 --> 03:19.373
Sometimes, sometimes, they're all wrong.

03:19.393 --> 03:20.254
You can't have doing deep, deep, deep hurt.

03:20.274 --> 03:21.656
You can't sometimes go in the rocks instead of finding screenwriters.

03:21.676 --> 03:22.357
You know, they relax in your life.

03:22.377 --> 03:23.378
They can hold it like that and you better shut up.

03:24.995 --> 03:27.079
Does that angle spin over to Kosovo?

03:27.761 --> 03:28.923
You mean?

03:28.943 --> 03:32.290
Does that angle spin over to Kosovo?

03:32.310 --> 03:43.915
Well, I think the Kosovo is, you know, what kind of Kosovo that they use every six months in the paper, but, you know, how do you feel about baking for the dinner?

03:43.895 --> 04:11.242
I don't know.

04:11.262 --> 04:11.522
I don't know.

04:11.840 --> 04:34.088
I think most of you, if you read Richard Hawthorne's piece in the show for this group, this one, it's quite interesting, because he really hits his house in the cabins, and he's got an emotion with some targets, and a lot of himself, after the massacre, in the progress of the name of last year.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.531
And the emotions, as soon as he put on the cowboy American, which is that when he's going out and robbing him, he's dead.

04:36.899 --> 04:54.790
So, I don't know if there's any sort of rules to keep playing games for the first time.

04:55.343 --> 05:19.036
That was supposed to be who he was doing.

05:19.057 --> 05:19.477
I think he's done it.

05:19.497 --> 05:20.058
He was never really into it.

05:20.078 --> 05:20.699
He was going to make some cash.

05:20.719 --> 05:21.580
He's a big piece of property and a big man.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.221
He's really a true way in time.

05:22.241 --> 05:22.802
You know, what do you think?

05:22.822 --> 05:23.082
I don't know.

05:23.102 --> 05:23.663
That's a lot of information.

05:26.427 --> 05:45.751
Questions?

05:45.771 --> 05:49.275
I'm trying to say, people who are angry and are so angry, some things that have to be successful, help you get over, and some things that are angry, do you think that's great?

05:49.295 --> 05:49.836
Because I think in general,

05:51.368 --> 06:11.335
I think that I have an instant meaning that we don't have, unfortunately, a symbolical action.

06:11.355 --> 06:12.958
I think that there is no way that it's to, you know, to persecute all the world.

06:12.978 --> 06:13.258
What the hell?

06:14.572 --> 06:38.530
On one level, the people prosecute at the range of the tribunal is taken with the prostitute.

06:38.551 --> 06:39.552
But the existence of the tribunal only is not yet.

06:39.572 --> 06:40.253
The work is the tribunal is taken.

06:40.273 --> 06:40.794
Means a lot, a new roster.

06:40.814 --> 06:41.355
Regardless of their tenure,

06:42.263 --> 07:06.635
to do not turn out what is here on the daily basis of 100% of people.

07:06.655 --> 07:07.276
This process is no action part.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.518
The goal is that people are the understanding of the country.

07:08.538 --> 07:10.060
When we will see what will happen in the future, I am optimistic, I am more.

07:10.563 --> 07:33.316
Tragic guilt.

07:33.336 --> 07:33.596
Tragic guilt.

07:33.616 --> 07:33.957
That's the world.

07:33.977 --> 07:35.619
Because right now we are in a position of some kind of fascination of our actions.

07:35.639 --> 07:36.861
But no one in Bosnia feels himself as a winner or as a loser.

07:36.881 --> 07:37.221
That's the point.

07:37.241 --> 07:37.802
This war ended one year ago.

07:39.453 --> 08:02.254
So I don't feel that I live in this world, not the world, the world is over, but no one...

08:08.714 --> 08:32.341
No one will allow this to happen.

08:32.361 --> 08:34.523
Control of this area now is under social responsibility of the United States involved in all these projects.

08:34.543 --> 08:36.966
And definitely, the United States are performing a magnificent part of the testing of the alliance, of the left alliance,

08:37.756 --> 08:48.188
and working is just a case study.

08:50.090 --> 08:50.711
Just a case study.

08:50.731 --> 09:01.404
Because you have a mighty organization called NATO, which never worked it out.

09:01.424 --> 09:03.906
It does not have an action.

09:03.926 --> 09:04.647
It took eight months of negotiating.

09:04.667 --> 09:05.148
Who's in charge?

09:05.168 --> 09:05.929
Who's in charge?

09:05.949 --> 09:06.970
Who will issue executive order of that?

09:08.030 --> 09:32.678
and acts both upon the Regulation of the Security Council and both as they are leaving the military force.

09:32.699 --> 09:35.742
Eight months of fruitful negotiations between the Allies before we had experienced on the ground how different times they found out in the Bombas Union.

09:36.363 --> 09:58.291
with all the major penalties in relation to the world.

09:58.311 --> 09:59.733
While at the same time, I would say that I would not believe it enough.

09:59.753 --> 10:01.815
I am here talking about musical sounds, a different kind of a sound of things for all the other people.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.838
It is not the word between Mento and the Balkans story now, it is the word between Mento and Russia.

10:04.612 --> 10:25.635
And why not that's the style because there were anti-procites.

10:25.655 --> 10:27.918
They are very likely aiming to enter the majority of the French and American things because of the security area.

10:27.938 --> 10:28.999
So we are under all the countries and they have the .

10:29.553 --> 10:49.557
Every time when there is a moment of momentum ahead, a step ahead, someone from their background wants to pull it and tell them, let's deduce something not to be too, not to be honest with you.

10:50.379 --> 10:52.121
Just curious, you seem very optimistic.

10:52.141 --> 10:56.326
I was wondering, was the president passed more than anyone responsible for that?

10:56.346 --> 10:58.969
Like you said, it seemed like you came more favorably in the profile.

10:59.270 --> 11:21.001
A responsible woman.

11:21.021 --> 11:22.443
I mean, if you look at the search, you see, you know, you get breached.

11:22.463 --> 11:23.284
We often do definitely do responsibility.

11:23.304 --> 11:25.928
I don't encourage you to show much and much, but you can actually recognize the responsibility of the religion that is responsible.

11:25.948 --> 11:27.690
The responsibility also lies to bringing the Chinese people partly conflicted together.

11:28.835 --> 11:49.654
And what was it said?

11:49.674 --> 11:50.094
On that, what was it?

11:50.114 --> 11:53.377
On the bottom of this month, before the iron, before the tearing down the old breach in Mostar, it was shown right there, like it's still under cover, as you feel.

11:53.397 --> 11:56.580
But what I noticed is because of the start of all this story, and then the pain made, the iron would be the body, the brutal scene for the mountain population.

11:56.999 --> 12:20.198
And Ayodhadev may be for the part of everything that he was not very sincere.

12:20.218 --> 12:21.600
The president told us that when they were so often, he was not right.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.302
He was very aware of what he knew.

12:22.322 --> 12:22.602
He went there.

12:24.758 --> 12:51.781
But with regards to like the arms environment and stuff, unfairness provided, you do not see any responsibility.

12:51.801 --> 12:52.962
I have a little bit of a thing about the arms environment.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.023
Well, without the surveillance or the under-framing,

12:54.712 --> 13:01.104
But you know what the funny thing is about it?

13:01.124 --> 13:03.728
It's not that we are desperately in need of the weapons.

13:03.749 --> 13:11.222
It's the thing that we have to buy this weapons and we know at those states who have the weapons.

13:11.242 --> 13:18.255
That practically means that someone did not earn a lot of money by saying that the weapons aren't involved.

13:19.180 --> 13:29.231
What is $100 like for the environment is $500.

13:29.251 --> 13:35.338
This is the most difficult, monthly account of this era to put yourself in.

13:35.358 --> 13:41.164
It effectively means that someone controlled for the situation of standing beyond.

13:41.344 --> 13:45.049
Because we are crossed by the referee in order to survive.

13:45.069 --> 13:47.331
In the current, there is no...

13:47.513 --> 13:51.159
There's no way he arms into Bosnia.

13:52.281 --> 13:56.268
It doesn't look like he was serving as a service plan.

13:56.288 --> 13:58.471
When I was saying what the Russians gave a service plan.

13:59.193 --> 13:59.313
Sure.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.755
Well, a lot of it was just a service character.

14:01.396 --> 14:01.517
Right.

14:01.537 --> 14:01.817
Right.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.063
But it just wasn't a level of the same deal as the U.N.

14:05.083 --> 14:05.443
You know?

14:05.463 --> 14:05.563
Yeah.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.288
I mean, you wouldn't have been written.

14:08.308 --> 14:09.430
Well, I'm just wondering... The U.N.

14:09.450 --> 14:10.672
is nothing more than you think it is.

14:10.692 --> 14:11.293
Passive, bureaucratic.

14:11.645 --> 14:36.857
If you use, I just want it from a Bible perspective, to decide how that came out, how that would work out.

14:36.877 --> 14:41.162
It was that they put down the model as a prevention that the war is already... The wise people, the strategists, already have warned about the possibility that a body of war might occur on the horizon.

14:42.678 --> 15:05.509
That is what they do.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.030
But reality is different.

15:06.050 --> 15:06.551
You have to buy the arms.

15:06.571 --> 15:07.612
Whatever gives you the best price or the best price.

15:07.632 --> 15:08.273
You're going to ask for the LID.

15:08.293 --> 15:09.014
Or you cannot say for your provider.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.997
And the extent of the arms, you know, the homogeneity, lots of support, all the services you have,

15:12.158 --> 15:16.349
is quite astonishing.

15:16.369 --> 15:24.852
Phil Goldbach was going to talk about in the military.

15:25.355 --> 15:46.948
How is content being portrayed in schools?

15:46.968 --> 15:49.472
Is there any sort of discussion about how it's being presented to students on a wide-up scale, or is it just kind of up here?

15:49.492 --> 15:51.615
Is there any sort of information on that, or how the content is about the possibility of things like that?

15:51.865 --> 16:16.741
Right now, in this moment, 18 of the 18 elected professors in the third generation, like in Pittsburgh, they've been put very on of the study towards the aim of the program is how to implement the living life of the learning and the curriculum.

16:16.761 --> 16:17.282
Now there's a special cut.

16:28.737 --> 16:51.158
in the process, regardless of the form of how we present the things, what am I right, or do I have a right, and what I do, of the government, .

16:51.178 --> 16:51.878
Our, for me, our agency is the U.S.

16:51.898 --> 16:52.319
to appeal to the U.S.

16:52.339 --> 16:52.759
to appeal to the U.S.

16:52.779 --> 16:53.200
to appeal to the U.S.

16:53.220 --> 16:53.640
to appeal to the U.S.

16:53.660 --> 16:54.080
to appeal to the U.S.

16:54.100 --> 16:54.521
to appeal to the U.S.

16:54.541 --> 16:54.961
to appeal to the U.S.

16:54.981 --> 16:55.402
to appeal to the U.S.

16:55.422 --> 16:55.842
to appeal to the U.S.

16:56.429 --> 17:20.424
So we are introducing these things that are interesting in the program to give us a necessary background in the background building and the background support.

17:20.444 --> 17:22.067
But when we enter the stage to reform, I want you secondary and higher education.

17:22.087 --> 17:24.310
Because today the war is not a particular good place between any sort of transformation and any sort of reform.

17:24.610 --> 17:33.841
If you can maintain the educational system, that's okay.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.482
But please don't change it.

17:35.502 --> 17:42.030
Educational institutions are more or less changeable.

17:42.110 --> 17:47.777
They have a changeable structure, have some kind of autonomy.

17:47.797 --> 17:50.820
So the issue of changing the curriculum, the changing of the profile,

17:52.218 --> 18:10.044
of the habits of the students and the working habits of the nation, largely depend on the development of all the society.

18:10.064 --> 18:14.191
So it would be useless to have a musical school if you are desperately needed to pretend, I don't know, that's what you knew, or whatever.

18:14.211 --> 18:19.238
But the universities are the places where these things can be done on a daily basis.

18:20.382 --> 18:32.980
because of the concentration of the professor and because the university knows how to do this.

18:33.000 --> 18:49.244
It might be interesting to you that the government just, according to the record and the constitution, reform the central government or the federal government do not have any responsibilities for the university.

18:49.264 --> 18:50.085
So it practically means that

18:51.078 --> 19:09.693
We are talking about something, a mixture of the system between the United States and the Germany, when the minister is not involved in the process of discrimination, in each of other organizations.

19:09.893 --> 19:13.660
That will bring the spirit, that will open the door of the audience of the UK.

19:14.500 --> 19:19.447
who they think, what they want, and how to learn it.

19:19.527 --> 19:28.619
And it could be a variety of different kinds of development, but very intensive development.

19:30.681 --> 19:41.796
And that is a good thing, because if you put the power to the local community, send the local community provider of everything, so the money, the food, the maintenance.

19:41.816 --> 19:43.258
There is no one above who will take care

19:45.837 --> 19:49.963
That's the whole issue about being irresponsible.

19:51.064 --> 20:01.739
So we will be very busy about to survive in terms of our home budget, so we will not stop that.

20:02.019 --> 20:09.229
Yes, this is a question for either speaker, and you actually filled up Bill's carrot made with Jesus.

20:09.496 --> 20:34.268
When we talk about cooperation between people, the key importance that you usually look at is trust and the level of trust between people.

20:34.288 --> 20:37.973
Other than watching for care, what signpost community or would you be looking for to kind of show the guy's trust is being built between one party?

20:37.993 --> 20:38.794
Do you mean you're being very optimistic

20:39.162 --> 20:48.677
I think people will feed off that optimism, but there has to be some concrete scientists that they have.

20:49.699 --> 20:55.729
And one of the things I'm thinking of making is sharing a group, electricity group, something like that along those lines.

20:55.749 --> 21:01.839
What scientists would you suggest that we look for to show that it is moving in the right direction?

21:02.460 --> 21:03.501
It doesn't take a while.

21:03.661 --> 21:04.022
Obviously, right.

21:04.930 --> 21:18.268
The last one, this 22 years, is there anything that you should look at?

21:18.328 --> 21:25.318
There's a certain article in your time by a small village up in the north that was all three groups were operated with a back group.

21:25.703 --> 21:32.270
And it probably started out there before it started.

21:34.012 --> 21:49.888
It was out there, you know, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.

21:53.530 --> 22:06.552
I don't see that happening.

22:06.572 --> 22:07.434
It's just how it is right now.

22:07.454 --> 22:10.659
It's going to take a while.

22:10.679 --> 22:11.761
Most things happen, but it's going to take a while.

22:11.781 --> 22:12.282
You should look for them.

22:12.302 --> 22:13.664
There's nothing that we can really accomplish in the next few years.

22:13.684 --> 22:14.065
Well, I don't know.

22:14.085 --> 22:15.026
My optimism is that it comes to a quiet moment.

22:15.046 --> 22:15.607
It's just what I want to do.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.028
Mind is rooted in...

22:16.413 --> 22:38.773
something that I learned from my own history in my country.

22:38.793 --> 22:43.117
It's an amazing type of tool that can be developed in the community.

22:43.137 --> 22:45.559
So everything, any sort of reaction that you have in this particular issue is welcomed into the momentum that can provide

22:46.653 --> 23:14.649
I'm quite optimistic because I have a set of extra-normal examples of people living, loving, and working together, regardless of the differences between them.

23:14.669 --> 23:15.090
If that hope is gone,

23:16.083 --> 23:40.339
I knew that, as you know, from the current lecture in the Greek literature, folks will dry off and folks, of course, as you can call, blind.

23:40.359 --> 23:42.843
But there are some points in the pictures of the present at the point that gives you best time of the opportunity.

23:42.863 --> 23:44.225
Communication will be intentional.

23:44.245 --> 23:45.567
I mean, communication between the people, exchanging of the views,

23:46.373 --> 24:12.008
free access to the media.

24:12.028 --> 24:13.891
We have enough education, enough communication, but you know, communication is a crazy issue.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.553
People who can use the relations of people who will be a little bit more informed,

24:16.090 --> 24:44.190
And let's face it, total destruction of the country got

24:44.693 --> 25:08.837
26 billions of dollars.

25:08.857 --> 25:09.077
This is OK.

25:09.097 --> 25:11.379
40 billions of dollars is the cost of entering the arms of the atomic bomb that was projected only in Russia only.

25:11.399 --> 25:12.780
They are not talking about other countries like Syria or the Ukraine.

25:12.800 --> 25:13.401
But we are now in the baptism.

25:13.752 --> 25:38.539
We are now being analyzed on a lot of different things.

25:38.559 --> 25:38.859
Are we capable?

25:38.879 --> 25:39.941
And what are we capable to hold our future into life?

25:39.961 --> 25:40.922
We have a tutor, we have an international tutor.

25:40.942 --> 25:42.223
You are living in a little bit of democracy, maybe in Sebastian.

25:43.182 --> 26:02.351
That's the very hard thing to do.

26:02.371 --> 26:03.593
Until things go better in long distance and controlled space.

26:03.613 --> 26:04.214
I mean, in a controlled space.

26:04.234 --> 26:04.835
That's the whole point, right?

26:04.855 --> 26:06.237
The tremendous effort that the UN State Department did in the future.

26:06.892 --> 26:31.943
Maybe you're going to catch it in your news and maybe ask yourself a question, why these talks took so long time?

26:31.964 --> 26:32.484
Why all these conferences?

26:32.504 --> 26:32.925
Why all these visits?

26:32.945 --> 26:33.365
Why all these things?

26:33.385 --> 26:34.146
Good evening, it can't be in that way.

26:34.166 --> 26:35.548
It can't be in that way because we didn't part in the cellar's place.

26:39.308 --> 26:54.111
with the contribution of the country, with the process of the future, and, of course, with the involvement of the community in the world, new people are

27:02.461 --> 27:22.663
I have to say something also is that I'm sure that many of you are sitting here today

27:22.643 --> 27:37.705
And there is a possibility, a strong possibility, about next summer to be promoted.

27:37.726 --> 27:39.849
KSQ was about it, you looked at it a little bit earlier, that we will have a service here in this project.

27:39.869 --> 27:40.790
We're going to be taking a motion to Virginia.

27:40.810 --> 27:41.631
We're going to take a motion to Virginia.

27:41.651 --> 27:42.473
We're going to take a motion to Virginia.

27:42.493 --> 27:43.674
We're going to take a motion to Virginia last summer in St.

27:43.694 --> 27:44.095
Lawrence University.

27:44.075 --> 27:53.764
where we will send a group of students out there who will be given an introduction to the area.

27:53.947 --> 28:18.277
the last four years in Bosnia and the country's development efforts to join our real solid in developing academic and development to that country and to the way people are working for the future.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.900
Then in the afternoon, team students up with other students from the University of Ontario to meet any number of service projects.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.143
I think if you were doing English tutoring or working in soccer camps or as you

28:23.123 --> 28:50.818
see in the film today that the building effort is so important getting out there and actually doing some work with any number of things that need to be done and i think you're setting up such a very exciting opportunity because what we need to do is grab people in your age you get out there need your cup of hearts and very able to make those friendships and make those connections that will go in the culture

28:51.001 --> 29:08.520
The concept is very simple.

29:08.540 --> 29:18.190
In fact, as many American students for the case of Boston, because that would be our reference that we can come from.

29:19.317 --> 29:24.523
The soldiers are now returning from the Bosnia.

29:24.543 --> 29:44.527
Because it was not a bloody war like in Vietnam, I think that the central thing that they can tell in their families is a reference for the future of Bosnia.

29:44.908 --> 29:49.273
On that way, the people trying to focus

29:49.743 --> 30:14.238
There is a very special program in the previous type of simple stories.

30:14.258 --> 30:15.000
What is so specific about the Bosque?

30:15.020 --> 30:17.323
Maybe you are from the spot understanding what is going on and what are the troubles and challenges in front of us.

30:17.343 --> 30:18.805
I don't think that this is too much that you are unable to understand it.

30:19.122 --> 30:43.768
And you see the way it's going.

30:43.788 --> 30:45.430
And then you see the attitude of the people over the land there and over the area.

30:45.450 --> 30:45.930
That's what needs to be.

30:45.950 --> 30:47.652
You know, imagine your camp just being a camp in the history of all the architecture.

30:47.672 --> 30:48.673
It will be a boring place if you're on the ground.

30:50.189 --> 31:03.429
It will be, or even a boring place, the house, the building, the museum, got their full meaning if there are people around.

31:03.449 --> 31:06.673
You know, who cares about the library without a user?

31:07.655 --> 31:09.898
Who will read the books?

31:09.918 --> 31:13.243
Who will preview the books if there is no reader to buy it?

31:15.653 --> 31:45.373
I think that people are in the communication between the people and of course changing of their ideas and although you are only capable to make sure to hold the liberal emphasis in the 21st century as I was mentioning this morning of the college would like to open and be prepared for the type of internationalization in the 21st century and

31:46.113 --> 32:08.183
On my side, I would like to see, uh, I would like to see the department of these opinions.

32:08.203 --> 32:12.829
Well, um, if, if, if there are any more questions, I'm sure that you can, uh, you know, grab hold of some of our speakers, um, but I, I just haven't, I think that, um, uh, kind of, so, no, I want some things, uh, clearly, you know.
