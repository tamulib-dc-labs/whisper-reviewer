00:02.309 --> 00:05.973
I'm with Charles Fleishauer.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.175
I'm sorry.

00:07.235 --> 00:09.238
I need new glasses, by the way.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.040
I have an appointment.

00:11.360 --> 00:11.620
Don't worry.

00:11.681 --> 00:13.963
It's Carl Fleishauer, I'm sorry.

00:14.864 --> 00:18.769
And you are the technical coordinator for the National Digital Library Program.

00:19.230 --> 00:22.434
So can you just tell me a little bit about what that involves?

00:24.136 --> 00:28.401
Maybe act as if I know nothing about the National Digital Library Program.

00:29.039 --> 00:49.242
The digital library program at the Library of Congress is focused on the reproduction of historical collections, the reproduction of historical materials, and we want to provide access for people to

00:50.605 --> 00:54.410
materials especially from our Special Collections Division.

00:54.510 --> 01:03.782
So there's been a considerable emphasis on photographic collections and manuscript collections and collections from the Music Division.

01:04.904 --> 01:10.070
Recently we've added to what we've put online materials from the American Folklife Center.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.275
There's a folk music collection and there's also a math collection.

01:13.916 --> 01:16.579
Now in that mix of things,

01:17.099 --> 01:22.707
Of course, we have an interest in printed matter and books.

01:23.208 --> 01:37.608
And the printed matter collections that have been prepared thus far include broadsides, pamphlets, and some books.

01:38.930 --> 01:46.701
The point, I think, is to suggest that books are part of a mix of different types of materials that we reproduce,

01:47.153 --> 02:01.749
And I would say our emphasis so far has been as much or more on materials other than books and rather less on books, but we have done some and we're coming along on that.

02:02.570 --> 02:11.220
The principal reason for the Digital Library Project at the Library of Congress is...

02:12.095 --> 02:19.722
the provision of access, that is the creation of a resource that would be useful especially to the field of education.

02:20.343 --> 02:39.520
We have traditionally served scholars and higher education people, both teachers and students, and have not traditionally provided much service to the lower levels of education, K-12 education,

02:39.955 --> 02:48.604
And the Librarian of Congress clearly sees the movement of selected materials onto the Internet as a way of broadening our audience.

02:48.724 --> 02:58.093
That is, that we can provide service to the field of education in a way from top to bottom, whereas we've only really been doing it from the middle to the top.

02:59.274 --> 03:07.903
And that means that the selection of materials and the way in which the materials are presented

03:08.727 --> 03:29.298
is intended to serve this function of providing a resource for education and also providing a resource to, you know, the lifelong learner, as the buzzword goes, you know, meaning citizens who are not in formal education at this point.

03:29.318 --> 03:32.423
The reason that's

03:32.707 --> 04:01.701
interesting in the arena of digitizing materials including the digitization of books is that it tends to influence the technical approaches that are taken for example there are other projects at universities part of what's going on at Cornell and part of what goes on at Yale where the impetus has come

04:02.407 --> 04:10.316
And the human energies involved have come from people that have been traditionally in preservation work.

04:10.336 --> 04:13.841
They have the same people, actually, wearing two hats, which is amazing.

04:14.481 --> 04:16.824
Well, I think, and that's highly appropriate.

04:16.884 --> 04:17.966
It's an excellent thing.

04:18.026 --> 04:30.000
And it means, though, that their frame of reference tends to be a continuation or an expansion of preservation programs

04:30.419 --> 04:36.928
And it's especially important, of course, with brittle books and the risk of loss of brittle books and damaged books.

04:37.669 --> 04:41.795
And in a way, you could read their question in the early stages.

04:41.895 --> 04:45.500
I think they've all gotten more sophisticated and complicated about it lately.

04:45.540 --> 04:58.198
But in the early movement, one detected there the question, when can we stop microfilming and start making digital copies for the books that have to be discarded?

04:58.904 --> 05:03.890
And the Cornell Project has been an absolute national model on that.

05:03.930 --> 05:10.439
Everybody's really grateful for it, and they've set a number of technical standards and so on that are very helpful.

05:11.200 --> 05:23.275
But I'm contrasting that approach with where we have found ourselves, for example, in which the motive from the Librarian of Congress has been more

05:24.638 --> 05:29.684
to think about provision of access and to think about the broad provision of access.

05:29.864 --> 05:44.742
And interestingly, one of the impacts of that is that when we select materials of all kinds, including books, the selection is not based on judgments about condition.

05:46.064 --> 05:53.413
Now, sometimes the condition in which a book is or something else, you know, then has certain ramifications about what we do technically.

05:53.647 --> 06:09.946
but the selection is done for the sake of the either known or hoped for or presumed value of the material to people in the field of education.

06:09.966 --> 06:11.007
How about if I do that?

06:11.127 --> 06:12.509
You sure?

06:12.569 --> 06:21.139
Okay, so we're selecting for, well...

06:21.372 --> 06:27.681
In the first years, of course, we selected against a presumption of value because it was really hard to see what there is.

06:27.701 --> 06:37.995
I think more and more we now have users in the education community and will be able to replace the presumption of value with, you know, some clear sense of value.

06:38.075 --> 06:41.980
Could you just, for the record, tell me when you began, when the project began?

06:42.981 --> 06:47.127
The activity here...

06:47.697 --> 07:02.553
started as a pilot project that was nicknamed American Memory, and in fact John Cole and James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, I think, cooked up the idea and the name between the two of them at dinner one night or something.

07:02.573 --> 07:07.539
This would have been back in 1988 or 1989, I think probably 1988.

07:07.619 --> 07:16.168
And there were some others of us who then...

07:16.705 --> 07:21.794
were told of the idea and ultimately enlisted in the effort.

07:22.255 --> 07:40.907
And I had previously worked on some technical projects, so beginning in about 1989, I found myself helping plan what this American memory thing might be, since it sort of was a notion at a fairly high level and hadn't gotten to the practicalities.

07:41.765 --> 07:52.897
Then beginning in 1990, where we had a formal congressional authorization, you know, we go to Congress to make sure that we have an idea that meets their interests.

07:53.078 --> 08:07.614
And so we got funding from Congress for a five-year pilot, 1990 through 1994, and it was on a fairly small scale and used CD-ROM technology and so on.

08:07.674 --> 08:09.696
And when we came to the end of the pilot,

08:10.030 --> 08:12.254
It was clear that there was high interest.

08:12.474 --> 08:17.282
There was especially high interest in the K-12 community.

08:17.702 --> 08:24.253
High schools, especially, were seeing, having stuff in computerized form was useful.

08:25.415 --> 08:32.146
In fact, one teacher, who may have been a school librarian, I can't remember, sort of had an interesting aphorism.

08:32.166 --> 08:32.967
She said...

08:34.853 --> 08:38.398
I'm using history to teach about the computer.

08:38.578 --> 08:39.940
I think that's how she put it.

08:40.480 --> 08:52.215
That is, having historical materials helped her get students in the school library to think through how to use the computer and how to search and research for things.

08:52.336 --> 08:55.920
I mean, it was sort of a complete reversal of what most people would have said.

08:55.940 --> 09:03.510
And what's also accurate is that the computer draws some young people to the use of these materials.

09:04.283 --> 09:14.061
But she was interested in sort of sharpening their skills with research method and searching, which can be complicated, as you know, in the computer environment.

09:14.081 --> 09:26.865
Anyway, in 1994, it was clear that we should go on, but it was also clear that congressional support would be limited or certainly wouldn't grow.

09:27.352 --> 09:31.678
And so Dr. Billington faced the problem of, well, what do we do next?

09:31.758 --> 09:32.840
How do we proceed?

09:32.860 --> 09:45.998
And in 1994 and 1995, there was this big effort to define the project in a broader way for the next five years, and a fundraising effort ensued.

09:46.399 --> 09:55.131
And with a leadership gift from the Packard Foundation, this is the David and Lucille Packard Foundation,

09:55.718 --> 10:07.922
They gave $5 million, shortly followed by an additional gift of $5 million from John Kluge, and that really launched us, and then additional funds have been raised since.

10:07.942 --> 10:18.402
So we now have a project that is, once all the fundraising gets done, if we meet the goals, would be two-thirds donated funds.

10:18.668 --> 10:23.454
gift funds of one sort or another, and one-third congressional support.

10:23.674 --> 10:26.317
And there's no problem with the Congress on that?

10:27.198 --> 10:45.239
I think our sense of it is that Congress is very supportive, and, you know, everybody likes, I think everyone likes the idea of using appropriated funds, the taxpayers' money, as a kind of leverage to encourage private donations, you know, to match it.

10:46.741 --> 10:47.882
My, I mean,

10:48.790 --> 10:54.016
I'm not the right person to sort of say what that is.

10:54.096 --> 11:03.127
You know, we have folks who are officers in charge of congressional relations and so on, you know, but my sense is that it's all extremely warmly supported.

11:03.247 --> 11:18.105
Newt Gingrich himself is keen on future technologies, and when he arrived with the, was that the 104th Congress, the Congress that he was the speaker for the first time, he was enthusiastic, and, uh,

11:18.878 --> 11:36.296
Vice President Gore has been enthusiastic about the national information infrastructure, so I think it's really one of these cases where you have some bipartisan support, and I believe that what the library has been doing has seemed beneficial and useful, so it's been well supported.

11:36.817 --> 11:48.109
Anyway, the point was that we had this five-year pilot, and now we have kind of a five-year program that's defined for the digital library, and we're in the middle of that.

11:48.983 --> 11:50.365
And so you have a website.

11:50.946 --> 11:51.246
Right.

11:51.366 --> 12:04.265
Actually, the other thing I could say is that 1994 marked the point where the World Wide Web became visible, obvious, and widely used.

12:04.726 --> 12:07.310
It had invention some years earlier.

12:07.370 --> 12:10.955
It's the creature of some physicists in Switzerland, I think.

12:11.716 --> 12:15.902
But it burst forth in a way...

12:16.152 --> 12:18.935
just about the moment when we finished our pilot.

12:18.995 --> 12:30.630
So it also was a very convenient moment for us to begin to wean ourselves from CD-ROM discs, which I think are awkward for this kind of material at the extent that we have.

12:31.431 --> 12:35.496
It's not awkward for little batches of stuff, but it's really awkward for big batches of stuff.

12:36.377 --> 12:45.568
And to move into the World Wide Web environment, which we did, and I think October of 1994, if I'm remembering right, marks our debut...

12:45.970 --> 12:49.255
with historical collections on the World Wide Web.

12:49.275 --> 12:50.397
And your website is?

12:51.699 --> 13:03.939
The www.loc.gov is the Library of Congress homepage, and very, very prominent on the homepage is the place to click to get to American memory.

13:03.999 --> 13:09.227
We've kept the American memory name for the current period as a...

13:09.848 --> 13:12.070
sort of a trademark almost.

13:12.131 --> 13:19.078
It's not legally a trademark, but it's a series name or a mark for the collections, although the pilot program is over.

13:20.340 --> 13:25.065
And anyone can go in and access any of these?

13:25.145 --> 13:25.365
Right.

13:25.385 --> 13:27.007
Is this research step material?

13:27.848 --> 13:31.832
Well, the collections that we have up, I'll give you some examples.

13:31.993 --> 13:33.274
I think they are

13:35.245 --> 13:38.209
I think the depth is there more than the breadth, in a way.

13:38.229 --> 13:41.393
You know, we have about 20 collections.

13:41.413 --> 13:43.996
The Library of Congress has thousands of collections.

13:44.036 --> 13:52.087
And for the breadth, for serious research, you need literally hundreds of collections because a researcher will need to move from one collection to another.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.072
So I think as we move forward,

13:56.744 --> 13:59.828
Gosh, it's like publishing an encyclopedia.

13:59.848 --> 14:06.636
You know, we've got volumes A, B, and C up there, and until we get all the way to volume Z, it won't have the breadth one needs.

14:07.598 --> 14:11.062
But the collections are varying in their depth.

14:11.482 --> 14:19.933
We put up, for example, the entire batch of life histories from the federal writers' projects

14:20.302 --> 14:22.406
what they call their folklore project.

14:22.446 --> 14:27.515
The Federal Writers Project had a number of different things that they did, and one was called the Folklore Project.

14:28.096 --> 14:33.606
So that is those life histories number about 2,900.

14:33.866 --> 14:44.605
It covers about 22,000 pages of typescript because the life histories were typed rather than tape-recorded.

14:45.243 --> 14:50.569
And it covers, I think, 24 states of the United States.

14:50.669 --> 14:52.952
We don't have things from every state.

14:53.312 --> 14:56.016
And it's a rich and varied collection.

14:56.076 --> 14:57.798
I think there's been a lot of use of it.

14:58.038 --> 15:03.625
And I think there's some, you know, it's got good depth.

15:04.886 --> 15:08.330
Another collection with... And it's all text, by the way.

15:08.410 --> 15:08.710
Correct.

15:08.730 --> 15:10.052
There's no visual stuff.

15:10.471 --> 15:19.365
That's text collection, and the federal writers were out-of-work writers who were hiring.

15:19.465 --> 15:23.050
I know the history of the project, but I'm thinking in terms of what you put up on the website.

15:23.491 --> 15:30.842
The Internet really is remarkable for things that it can give you that you can never get in text.

15:31.160 --> 15:34.927
Well, I'll get to those in a minute.

15:34.948 --> 15:36.631
We've got glories in the other way.

15:36.691 --> 15:39.196
I'm sorry, am I belaboring this too much?

15:39.296 --> 15:40.438
No, no, no, no.

15:41.420 --> 15:51.801
Yes, that's a text collection, and I think what has really made it useful to a broader audience is the fact that the texts were transcribed and made searchable.

15:52.473 --> 16:05.014
So that one can look at these 22,000 pages and, you know, if you're curious about jazz music or Armenian immigrants or whatever it is, you can search.

16:05.034 --> 16:08.119
Well, you're searching the actual full text of the documents.

16:08.707 --> 16:10.390
And they lend themselves to that.

16:10.410 --> 16:18.262
To get to your own interest in a book, I would say, well, they are narrative in quality, but they are very short narratives.

16:18.523 --> 16:28.279
And it's in fact quite convenient to find an eight or ten page block of stuff by finding keywords in it, and then that makes sense to read.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.462
Another...

16:30.779 --> 16:44.777
I think deep collection for a person who's interested in a certain kind of iconography is a pictorial one, and that is the complete negative holdings that we have from the Detroit Publishing Company.

16:44.817 --> 16:47.581
The Detroit Publishing Company was in the postcard business.

16:48.382 --> 16:52.307
We have their negative file for what they had east of the United States.

16:52.467 --> 16:57.934
The stuff west of the United States went to the Colorado Historical Society

16:59.095 --> 17:02.799
and someday they'll digitize those and they'll unite them.

17:03.059 --> 17:09.645
Isn't that beautiful where you can actually get a very synergistic kind of a collection out of... Well, I think so.

17:09.966 --> 17:21.637
But our negatives, there were 25,000 in number, glass plates, for the most part glass plates, 8 by 10 inches, and there was really no access to them.

17:21.937 --> 17:27.803
It was not affordable to make a print of each one, so in effect the collection was...

17:28.559 --> 17:29.661
You know, unusable.

17:30.843 --> 17:44.103
And we had a project to, you know, with a contractor first made motion picture film, and then the motion picture film was scanned, and the 25,000 pictures were cataloged, and they're up there now.

17:45.505 --> 17:55.461
And I think most people use them to, you know, find illustrative materials that get at hometowns,

17:55.677 --> 17:59.060
If they're curious about that, certain towns are very well covered.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.582
It's turn of the century, I should say.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.145
The date range is about 1880 to 1920.

18:04.226 --> 18:06.768
And some states are very well represented.

18:06.828 --> 18:08.190
Some are poorly represented.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.811
So it's kind of a luck of the draw.

18:09.851 --> 18:12.554
But where it's well represented is very good stuff.

18:12.654 --> 18:17.018
Now, what would be interesting, you know, this is a question of research depth.

18:19.301 --> 18:20.622
We had a...

18:21.125 --> 18:29.359
We had an evaluation period, and one of our evaluation sites was an elementary school in Indianapolis, Indiana.

18:29.519 --> 18:34.788
As luck would have it, Indianapolis is well represented in this collection.

18:34.808 --> 18:43.082
So we had one of our staff folks went over to visit the site and try to gauge how it was used, and she went along on a bus trip through town.

18:44.108 --> 18:57.420
where the kids had printed out pictures of different places in Indianapolis from this collection at the turn of the century, and where they went to look at the buildings or those places today, you know, and snapped their own snapshots.

18:58.882 --> 19:05.988
And so you can see how, you know, in that case, literally at the elementary school level, that collection works.

19:06.008 --> 19:13.255
What I haven't seen, which I think is potentially there, and I used the word iconography before, I think there's

19:13.724 --> 19:27.067
enough in that collection that would wrestle with the question of how a commercial picture enterprise portrays the cityscape or how it portrays public buildings.

19:27.728 --> 19:31.935
I mean, one might be curious about is there something that is done to make

19:34.160 --> 19:36.083
capitals look more heroic.

19:36.103 --> 19:37.806
I mean, I don't know what it is.

19:37.826 --> 19:39.709
There's an angle you can see.

19:39.869 --> 19:52.229
And so it wouldn't be hard to imagine a devoted graduate student in American Studies somewhere mining this collection because it's so large to get at some of those things.

19:52.669 --> 19:58.058
If you're a professional writer like myself, however, and you wanted to write something...

19:58.814 --> 20:06.703
and you wanted to see the correspondence and the records and the stuff like that, well, then this is a first step.

20:06.743 --> 20:11.228
Then maybe I have to call someone here and say, well, what kind of documentation do you have to do?

20:11.428 --> 20:13.310
What kinds of artists did they hire?

20:13.390 --> 20:15.252
What was the conversation for this?

20:16.093 --> 20:16.974
You know, that kind of stuff.

20:17.154 --> 20:21.298
I think, in fact, in this case, the collection really is dispersed somewhat.

20:21.339 --> 20:27.285
My understanding of the history of it was that it was first, and the company was located in Detroit, Michigan,

20:27.890 --> 20:36.601
when they went out of business, or at some point after they went out of business, all of their holdings went to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn.

20:37.502 --> 20:48.615
And the Henry Ford Museum wanted, I think in the 1940s or 1950s, they didn't feel that they could properly take care of the glass negatives.

20:48.635 --> 20:54.943
And the glass negatives at that point were shifted half to the Library of Congress and half to the

20:55.312 --> 20:57.096
Colorado Historical Society.

20:57.176 --> 20:58.498
I think we got them in the 50s.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.384
I wonder why they did a division like that.

21:01.524 --> 21:03.668
I don't know the details.

21:03.709 --> 21:13.969
My impression, although I'm not certain of this, is that it may be that the Henry Ford Museum retained whatever company files there may have been.

21:13.989 --> 21:15.632
So...

21:15.899 --> 21:45.889
the point is that indeed you may need to go look for some more information if you really wanted to delve and in this case the Library of Congress might not be able to provide it we have other collections we're working on again that have that same depth we are in the middle of working on the Farm Security Administration Office of War Information collection and of course the Farm Security Administration photos are world famous in that case we do have

21:46.291 --> 21:50.958
one significant block of written documentation that accompanies them.

21:51.419 --> 22:02.957
There's an additional significant block in Louisville, I think it's at the University of Louisville, which were donated by Roy Stryker, who ran the project.

22:03.037 --> 22:05.200
I think it was like his personal papers went there.

22:05.441 --> 22:09.647
And the National Archives has the official records of the Department of Agriculture.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.695
So here again, you get a sort of division on the different categories.

22:15.046 --> 22:20.294
Do you have the equipment here, or do you outsource the scanning, or do you do it here?

22:21.296 --> 22:30.010
Most of the time we contract out, and we've had a specialist contractor for pictures.

22:31.051 --> 22:41.087
I think we had a specialist contractor for the Federal Writers Project manuscripts, which were scanned in 1991 or 1992, something like that.

22:41.371 --> 22:45.837
We have a different contractor now that's scanning manuscript and book materials.

22:45.937 --> 22:54.108
We have another specialty outfit, actually two, for motion pictures, because we're doing early motion pictures.

22:54.128 --> 22:56.591
You're not limited by the equipment that you have in the building.

22:56.672 --> 22:59.676
I mean, you're limited really by the plants that you have available.

22:59.876 --> 23:00.316
Right.

23:00.497 --> 23:08.948
Well, each one of these collections poses a unique set of technical headaches, and

23:09.502 --> 23:20.114
it has been, I think, effective for us to have separate procurements, you know, over the years, you know, trying to find the best way to do these things.

23:20.134 --> 23:25.941
Well, to do glass negatives must present a particular... Well, you get handling problems.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.863
Well, it's really just handling.

23:27.903 --> 23:30.366
Now, those were done at a very early point.

23:30.686 --> 23:34.551
We actually inherited the movie film from a project that was done in the 1980s.

23:34.811 --> 23:36.673
The company that did it

23:37.177 --> 23:47.027
built something that looked like a huge lampshade with translucent glass that rotated around the central light source.

23:47.047 --> 24:02.543
And they had a work crew where one person took out the glass negative, set it on a panel of the lampshade, it rotated in front of the camera, and exposure was made, and it rotated, and then another person removed it from this lampshade and put it back in the envelope for storage.

24:03.113 --> 24:08.021
So they had a bit of a production line with this specially built rotating device.

24:08.061 --> 24:09.544
How was the resolution quality?

24:09.564 --> 24:26.252
Well, the Detroit pictures are a bit of a disappointment, and I think it has not to do with anything except the decision, because we were working in a video disc environment when we first did it, to use motion picture...

24:27.093 --> 24:32.279
negative size, which is what you would call a half frame for a still camera.

24:32.819 --> 24:41.049
And the film itself is not, shall we say, optimal for that.

24:41.129 --> 24:49.058
If you look at some other collections we've got up, we've used different approaches and larger intermediate film, and in some cases direct digital capture.

24:49.118 --> 24:50.699
So there's sort of been an evolution.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.982
The collection we just put up

24:53.300 --> 24:59.773
which we're proudest of for picture image quality, is a set of 4,000 panoramic photos.

25:00.535 --> 25:03.541
Again, these are quite interesting for some of the same reasons.

25:04.062 --> 25:09.513
There's a lot of documentation of Main Street USA, if you will.

25:09.533 --> 25:10.855
What was it called, this particular?

25:11.336 --> 25:12.659
Panoramic photograph.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.262
So every set of...

25:15.338 --> 25:17.780
Is that a particular collection or anything?

25:17.880 --> 25:21.224
It could be the Grand Canyon or Manhattan or whatever.

25:21.244 --> 25:21.604
Right.

25:21.704 --> 25:27.170
And there are natural scenes, although I think a very, very high proportion tend to be streetscapes.

25:27.330 --> 25:34.637
They date from about 1860 or 1864, and there's one or two that are Civil War period.

25:34.857 --> 25:36.439
I mean, I think there is actually a picture.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.042
It might be Atlanta after it was destroyed.

25:40.142 --> 25:41.063
I mean, I can't remember.

25:41.103 --> 25:44.046
Anybody can go on and copy these, too, right?

25:44.515 --> 25:44.936
Right.

25:45.016 --> 25:59.835
In this case, we made... Well, we made a... The story of the panoramic photos is that most of them, the largest number of them, were sent in with copyright registrations over the years.

26:01.057 --> 26:06.404
The photographers planned to market them and did market them locally, and they would register them.

26:07.305 --> 26:11.771
And I think we checked... I don't know.

26:11.791 --> 26:13.273
Out of the 4,000...

26:13.861 --> 26:20.708
about half of them were so far back in history that even if the copyright had been renewed, it would have expired.

26:21.288 --> 26:39.767
Then there was another thousand or so that could perhaps have been renewed, and we exhaustively checked the copyright records here and determined that the photographers had not renewed the copyright, and then I can't remember, there was a big miscellaneous category we had to

26:40.186 --> 26:57.158
do triage of one sort or another but we determined I think with a half a dozen exceptions or so that the pictures were now in the public domain and that we had harvested this copyright deposit category just as we do our books of course most of them come in that way the U.S.

26:57.218 --> 27:00.945
imprint that they were in the public domain so we were

27:02.005 --> 27:13.981
able to put them online and make them available to people as we have the Detroit collection, which also is not protected, we judge not protected by copyright, to the best of our ability to determine.

27:14.762 --> 27:19.429
And, you know, so we can share them.

27:19.449 --> 27:29.042
We will run into more challenges with providing access to material where there's greater ambiguity or in which

27:29.562 --> 27:31.764
there may be protection of copyright.

27:32.105 --> 27:39.692
We have before us the problem of making those available without injury to the owners.

27:40.513 --> 27:42.335
In some cases, we can get permission.

27:42.455 --> 27:44.657
In other cases, we'll do something else.

27:45.118 --> 27:49.462
Do you have an idea of how many images you've put up?

27:49.482 --> 27:49.822
How much?

27:51.164 --> 27:57.510
Well, it seems to me the pictorial stuff available to the public at this time

27:57.743 --> 28:01.526
must be on the order of 70,000 to 80,000 pictures.

28:03.929 --> 28:15.719
And then the various other things we have probably bring us to counting the source items, the things we started with, probably on the order of 100,000.

28:15.779 --> 28:25.708
The digital files we make, because we have to create multiple versions of some of these things, are probably more like

28:26.313 --> 28:28.456
400,000 or something like that.

28:28.516 --> 28:39.754
There are often three or four versions of a photo in different sizes, and with text materials, you know, there may be two versions.

28:40.215 --> 28:49.890
In fact, to go back to the Federal Writers Project, what we have online is both a facsimile of the page and also the searchable text.

28:50.292 --> 28:52.774
So there's sort of a dual presentation there.

28:52.794 --> 28:56.157
So what's the immediate goal of the National Digital Library?

28:56.177 --> 29:08.288
I mean, do you have numbers that— The target that the Librarian of Congress has set for us is that we're to have five million items by the year 2000.

29:09.169 --> 29:18.257
And that would be materials from the Library of Congress and, in addition, materials that are done by sister institutions,

29:19.722 --> 29:27.894
and become, how shall we say it, you'd have a common gateway or a common searching system.

29:28.455 --> 29:30.137
So you think that's achievable?

29:31.078 --> 29:32.981
You have the fact that you only have 80,000 by now?

29:33.923 --> 29:35.885
Well, we have a lot more in the pipeline.

29:37.347 --> 29:43.516
What I'm telling you there is, and that was pictures only, it's more like 100,000 things that are up right now.

29:43.717 --> 29:46.601
I would say over the next year we'll double or triple that.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.784
So there's an awful lot of stuff in the pipeline.

29:49.490 --> 29:58.978
And in addition, we're just now beginning, I think, to forge the connections with other institutions that will bring those materials in.

29:59.019 --> 30:03.322
We've had a special program to give awards.

30:04.383 --> 30:11.029
A donor gave us money specifically to re-donate it, as it were, to support digitizing in other institutions.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.953
That company was Ameritech in the first round of grants.

30:15.733 --> 30:17.455
I'm sorry, they're awards.

30:18.177 --> 30:37.847
We're not a grant-giving institution, but we have a program we call an award program there, where ten institutions were selected in the first year of the competition, ranging from small pieces from, in one case, North Dakota.

30:37.867 --> 30:41.152
I think it's North Dakota State University or North Dakota.

30:41.453 --> 30:44.117
Anyway, I'm not remembering exactly.

30:44.823 --> 30:50.672
There was also an award made to Harvard and one made to New York Public.

30:51.233 --> 31:03.973
And that begins to get us, you know, and what we'll do there is what we're hoping to do is, generally speaking, not have to sort of take on all of their content, but the cataloging.

31:05.375 --> 31:09.902
So we would build an integrated catalog that an end user could search,

31:10.355 --> 31:19.124
that the content could be distributed around all of these places, and, you know, in effect, invisible to the end user, you know, they could reach out and get it.

31:19.785 --> 31:30.315
There are to be three years of that awards program, and at the same time, there are some activities in other institutions like Cornell and the University of Michigan.

31:30.596 --> 31:32.678
Both of which I visited for this question.

31:32.698 --> 31:35.721
Right, and we're hoping that we can...

31:36.157 --> 31:54.688
find mutually agreeable and mutually beneficial ways, again, to pull, in effect, a catalog into common, perhaps both at their end and at our end, but certainly at our end, and the way in which

31:55.293 --> 32:06.690
you know, we'll really be able to talk about five million items in what will truly be a national digital library will be if you begin to have these... It will, in fact, be a national library.

32:06.710 --> 32:07.372
Right.

32:07.392 --> 32:16.225
And I think everyone who works here thinks that's proper and, you know, eagerly hopes for it and tries to achieve it.

32:16.646 --> 32:23.376
Now, as technical coordinator, you coordinate... Well, what happens...

32:25.313 --> 32:54.510
there's in a sense there's a number of technical coordinators it's a tough thing coming up with titles and government work sometimes the digital library is organized with the largest section or group within it is a group that has to do with production or the conversion of material into digital form and you know I'm a member of that group and uh

32:55.402 --> 33:03.554
maybe I'm a senior member, but there's another woman who works with me who's really more of a supervisor in the boss sense.

33:04.255 --> 33:15.350
And that group, which is maybe 12 or 15 people, something like that, collectively coordinates LC production of digital content.

33:15.831 --> 33:22.320
Then there's another part of the digital library, which is called user services, which is the part that has been

33:23.583 --> 33:40.282
trying to be sure that we're doing the best job we can with making things comprehensible and usable to the field of education, especially K-12 education.

33:40.322 --> 33:47.970
And they've cooked up a whole part of our website called the Learning Page, which is really aimed at educators,

33:48.727 --> 33:52.152
and is intended to help guide them into these collections.

33:52.172 --> 34:04.812
I mean, one of the things we learned during the pilot was that although school systems today are extremely eager to get primary source documents,

34:05.399 --> 34:19.612
and that there's a real movement in education to reduce the reliance on textbooks and increase the use of primary source materials in an attempt to get critical thinking skills built up.

34:20.753 --> 34:32.284
Still yet, the teachers are not always as sophisticated as one might need to be to make good use of fairly raw primary source collections.

34:32.652 --> 34:49.630
So the user services group, you know, is doing what it can to make our collections more comprehensible and to aid teachers in their ability to find things in some of them.

34:50.732 --> 35:01.123
Do you deal at all with what you mentioned briefly, you know, the area of the question of using digital...

35:01.677 --> 35:05.983
technology as a preservation tool.

35:06.003 --> 35:07.145
That's quite a hot subject.

35:07.626 --> 35:13.875
Well, the Library of Congress is moving in that direction, actually.

35:13.895 --> 35:19.483
I would say that, again, the digital activities at L.C.,

35:20.307 --> 35:36.030
launched in 1989 and 1990, really have been access-driven and have been there because the Librarian of Congress really insisted that we find ways to make our materials more available.

35:36.451 --> 35:49.470
His famous phrase was, get the champagne out of the bottle, and I think he saw that the Internet or the computer or whatever was going to get some champagne out of a bottle to where people could drink it.

35:50.277 --> 36:09.418
Now, over the five-year pilot, and especially now as we get into the digital library activities, there has increased interest in the preservation office in how digital fits in their realm.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.745
I'm certain that during the next year or two, we will...

36:16.383 --> 36:34.345
work actively with Cornell, for example, to try to adopt their approach to reproducing brittle books or damaged books using their concepts and approaches and will seek their help in doing so.

36:34.365 --> 36:37.969
And as we do more of that,

36:38.422 --> 36:48.135
then the books that are done in that way could also be made accessible, copyright permitting, by making derivative files or something.

36:48.977 --> 36:54.144
The interesting thing actually has been in the area of sound recordings.

36:54.784 --> 37:06.100
I wasn't really aware of this, but I've learned in the last few months that the 3M company and other American manufacturers have ceased, or have virtually ceased,

37:06.468 --> 37:09.593
to manufacture recording tape, analog recording tape.

37:11.396 --> 37:14.221
It's a thing of the past, I guess.

37:15.182 --> 37:29.185
And the preservation approach that had been used by our motion picture recording sound, recorded sound, and broadcasting division had been to make...

37:29.637 --> 37:33.663
tape copies of materials as preservation copies.

37:33.783 --> 37:39.992
For example, in some cases they had very old tapes that were falling apart and they made newer tapes of them.

37:40.012 --> 37:54.953
In other cases we have, again from WPA projects, transcriptions or what are called instantaneous disc recordings from the 1930s that are

37:55.355 --> 38:24.433
shellac on metal or shellac on glass or acetate on glass it isn't shellac acetate on aluminum or other aluminum materials and some of those are delaminating and coming apart so they make tape copies well they've gotten to the point now where no more tape and so they begin wrestling with the problem of what to do and some of us have seen I've certainly been in this

38:25.375 --> 38:45.582
state of mind that if the audio can be gotten into a computer file, then you have the capability of maintaining that computer file with the usual methods that are available for the preservation of computerized information, which is really this migration strategy.

38:46.243 --> 38:53.813
Diane told me that she'd given you that report by Don Waters, and I forget the other chap's name, but the

38:54.232 --> 39:08.119
I mean, the way digital information is preserved is by copying it through the many generations of equipment that come along, and in some cases by reformatting it as needed.

39:08.159 --> 39:16.054
And we are in our computer center down here trying to

39:16.793 --> 39:27.807
construct what we call a digital repository, you know, which will be so constructed as to permit the migration of information in a reliable way.

39:27.827 --> 39:31.011
But it's one thing to permit it, but who makes sure that it's done?

39:31.031 --> 39:35.676
Well, this is, you know, I used to smile on this one myself.

39:37.679 --> 39:45.889
The history of preservation has been, in a way, a history of finding the best medium of

39:46.443 --> 39:48.706
in putting one's faith in the medium.

39:49.587 --> 40:10.071
For example, a tremendous effort was put out to make sure that microfilm was reckoned out properly, that the right sort of base material was used for microfilm, and that the processing of the silver halide emulsion was such as to keep that silver image alive, and people reckon there's a

40:10.287 --> 40:18.177
you know, a 200-year lifespan to a microfilm or a microfilm master, and indeed it may be longer if properly stored.

40:18.197 --> 40:32.915
But we don't know anything about zeros and ones in various... And in other cases in the area of preservation historically, you also get the acid-free paper and some of those approaches, non-destructive.

40:33.415 --> 40:35.738
So you have a medium-centric...

40:36.275 --> 40:57.675
tradition there you know where people are looking at the medium there's to be fashionable in the jargon I think there's a real paradigm shift and the paradigm shift for digital information well I'm afraid it's an embarrassing one I should find a better way to put it but there really is in effect there's a different model

40:58.094 --> 40:59.497
for digital information.

40:59.577 --> 41:08.754
You cannot put your faith in media because the longevity of the equipment and the media, I mean, even if the media lasts, the readability of it can be a problem one way or another.

41:08.794 --> 41:11.599
How do you define a paradigm shift?

41:11.619 --> 41:12.180
Oh, cripe.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.745
Somebody wrote a book on it, you know.

41:15.626 --> 41:16.448
How do you visualize it?

41:16.468 --> 41:20.355
You don't have to define it, but in the context that you just used it.

41:21.955 --> 41:24.517
Well, it's a model in a way.

41:24.557 --> 41:35.128
There was a model of how one goes about this business of preserving things, and the model was you find media that has a very long life, and then you use it.

41:36.249 --> 41:41.834
The model for the preservation of digital information is forget the media.

41:42.935 --> 41:49.161
You've got to have a system that migrates, but you asked the right question, which is, well,

41:49.512 --> 41:51.274
then where are you putting your faith?

41:51.455 --> 41:54.539
And the answer is you're putting your faith in human administration.

41:55.700 --> 42:03.291
Now, you could argue that, in fact, even if you're putting your faith in media, you're also putting your faith in human administration.

42:03.351 --> 42:11.282
I mean, obviously, the microfilm masters need to be stored in vaults that are safe from fire and safe from atom bombs.

42:11.342 --> 42:14.406
I mean, it's not without its human administration.

42:15.044 --> 42:31.815
But shall we say the reliance on human administration and strategies for mustering human administration are critical to the preservation of digital information.

42:32.757 --> 42:38.487
Those of us who work at the Library of Congress, I think at least some of us, take some comfort from the fact that

42:39.057 --> 42:44.363
In the 1970s, we constructed a very large catalog of our holdings.

42:44.623 --> 42:47.306
That's digital information, the computer catalog.

42:48.227 --> 42:55.995
And I don't know how many generations of the mainframe computer we've been through, but we still have our catalog.

42:56.876 --> 43:04.425
It's migrated now for 20 years, and I don't think anybody doubts that the catalog will continue to be migrated through the future.

43:05.045 --> 43:08.389
So there is a certain amount of...

43:09.179 --> 43:11.202
comfort that someone might get.

43:11.262 --> 43:16.809
But again, the dependency is there for human administration.

43:16.829 --> 43:20.493
The catalog has migrated for 20 years because that's an essential document.

43:21.054 --> 43:21.515
Right.

43:21.875 --> 43:24.859
Nobody's about to forget to do the catalog.

43:25.019 --> 43:25.300
Right.

43:27.002 --> 43:34.071
But, you know, you're talking about millions of items at some point.

43:34.972 --> 43:35.052
Yep.

43:35.977 --> 43:37.259
You know, it's impossible.

43:37.299 --> 43:41.846
You know, somebody owns a library of 50,000 books, and somebody foolishly asks, have you read them all?

43:41.866 --> 43:44.310
Well, that's, you know, it's humanly impossible.

43:44.330 --> 43:48.035
I don't know anyone who's ever read 50,000 books.

43:48.536 --> 43:58.491
How do you ensure, you know, through human administration, that everything is migrated, not just the, you know, the catalog, which we know is going to be migrated?

43:58.707 --> 44:06.423
Well... You know, a little report on ticks, you know, out from the Rocky Mountains that nobody's asked to say in 23 years.

44:06.523 --> 44:11.172
I guess... I don't know, and there's other people who would be better to answer this.

44:13.357 --> 44:17.425
My sense of it is that there's a certain...

44:18.907 --> 44:22.150
that making things digital is an equalizer in this sense.

44:22.250 --> 44:27.254
That is, they are all ones and ohs, as you say, and they are all computer files.

44:27.535 --> 44:32.879
And at some level, they're not differentiated by their value one way or another.

44:33.019 --> 44:47.412
So what you have is you have a huge pool of digital information, and the type of human beings, in fact, that would be charged with the responsibility of sort of day-to-day maintenance...

44:49.096 --> 44:52.600
I think, don't distinguish between elements in the pool.

44:52.620 --> 44:55.062
Their job is to keep the pool alive.

44:56.264 --> 45:00.929
And, I mean, believe me, everybody worries about it, and we should worry about it.

45:01.309 --> 45:04.693
And citizens in our society, like yourself, should worry about it.

45:04.713 --> 45:08.877
I'm not saying that we oughtn't to worry about it, and I don't mean to be glib about the solution.

45:08.937 --> 45:13.382
I'm only saying that there's a shift in the model here where

45:14.071 --> 45:15.734
There is digital information.

45:15.974 --> 45:22.284
Some of it is the reproduction of historical stuff, but some of it is new material that is created in digital form.

45:22.684 --> 45:24.146
And exists in other forms.

45:24.247 --> 45:24.527
Right.

45:24.587 --> 45:32.439
And the society has an obligation to preserve that, just as it has an obligation to preserve things that are not in digital form.

45:32.960 --> 45:42.795
And the mechanism for that preservation, I think, will be the creation of computerized systems that are...

45:43.940 --> 46:02.477
capable of doing the right sorts of backups, keeping the backups in the right places, telling their operators when something's wrong, migrating things through generations of equipment, and migrating things through generations of formats.

46:02.517 --> 46:03.998
So who's working on that?

46:04.939 --> 46:07.922
Well, there's a variety, I think, of folks that work on that.

46:09.383 --> 46:10.885
Who could I talk to, for instance?

46:10.945 --> 46:13.407
Who would you suggest I talk to?

46:13.910 --> 46:14.591
I mean, I agree.

46:15.332 --> 46:19.957
You're a total substance with what you say, but is somebody, in fact, working on that?

46:19.977 --> 46:31.270
The people who are in our orbit include some folks that are working in our computer center.

46:33.092 --> 46:33.813
That's okay.

46:35.495 --> 46:43.444
Caroline Arms, A-R-M-S, is, I think, very knowledgeable about this and has been...

46:43.795 --> 46:49.384
in touch with the so-called Digital Library Federation, which also has an interest in it.

46:49.404 --> 47:02.023
Well, it's a consortium of institutions, including Cornell in Michigan and others, and they're kind of headquartered here in Washington at the

47:03.691 --> 47:10.718
It's CLIR, the Council for Library and Information Resources, or something like that.

47:10.738 --> 47:13.101
Did they put out the online magazine, Do Live?

47:14.602 --> 47:15.984
No, that's another outfit.

47:16.124 --> 47:21.009
That is the Coalition for National Research Initiatives.

47:21.029 --> 47:22.310
That's a very interesting site.

47:22.671 --> 47:22.951
Right.

47:23.111 --> 47:29.698
Well, Caroline Arms has been an author for them, and in fact her husband works at CNRI, so they have...

47:30.151 --> 47:38.080
They're a husband and wife on two sides of the fence, and CNRI is actually a consulting organization to the library.

47:38.100 --> 47:51.636
They were first brought in by the Copyright Office because the Copyright Office wanted to work on how to receive new registered materials in electronic form that safeguard them.

47:51.920 --> 48:06.557
keep them in a repository so they stay alive, but also have them in a repository that had sufficient access protection so the copyright owners would be willing to leave them there, if you see what I mean, without fear of theft or unauthorized use.

48:07.258 --> 48:14.447
And CNRI has been the organization that has done some design consultation on that for us.

48:14.527 --> 48:18.872
But Caroline, who works here, is knowledgeable about it.

48:19.257 --> 48:34.448
The other people in the computer center include a woman named Virginia Vitucci, Virginia Vitucci, V-I-T, Vitucci U-C-C-I, and Jim Stevens.

48:34.765 --> 48:39.730
Jim Stevens is 9688, that is 707-9688.

48:40.291 --> 48:47.578
Caroline Arms is 707-0105.

48:47.638 --> 48:57.728
And I may or may not have Virginia's phone number.

48:57.768 --> 49:01.752
Virginia's phone number is 707-9616.

49:02.592 --> 49:05.395
And they were all working in the computerized... Right.

49:05.415 --> 49:11.022
It's called Information Technology Services, or ITS for short.

49:11.042 --> 49:12.924
And that's the name of our computer center.

49:14.526 --> 49:22.935
And she, in particular, could speak to... Well, what are the elements that are needed to build a repository?

49:23.135 --> 49:25.218
You know, what are the design features?

49:25.718 --> 49:28.161
And how do those design features...

49:29.879 --> 49:37.815
Will those design features reassure worried citizens about, you know, the preservation of digital information?

49:40.941 --> 49:41.181
Good.

49:42.404 --> 49:46.572
I'll have to give him the call back today.

49:46.923 --> 49:49.306
That's fascinating stuff.

49:49.327 --> 49:53.593
Well, it's quite interesting, and I would say, well, sure, it's in its infancy.

49:53.653 --> 50:07.052
I mean, we're not talking about a dumb deal where everybody's got it figured out, but I think, you know, again, the challenge is to reckon out, you know, how one does deal with these materials.

50:07.653 --> 50:12.340
Now, I would say this, to go back to our historical collections program earlier,

50:14.378 --> 50:19.445
we have not discarded the originals, you know, when we reproduce them.

50:20.105 --> 50:22.448
Well, again, our approach has been different.

50:22.468 --> 50:27.795
We're not really tied to the preservation activities right now, and we're not doing brittle books.

50:27.815 --> 50:34.484
So, you know, all the glass plate negatives in the Detroit collection are still on the premises.

50:34.844 --> 50:39.350
All of the original sheets of paper from the Federal Writers Project are still in the files.

50:39.771 --> 50:40.752
Thank goodness.

50:40.772 --> 50:42.394
And, in fact,

50:42.998 --> 51:05.698
go to your topic in a way we try not to hurt the books when we scan them because we want to keep the book it's an important artifact so they've got to be scanned while they're bound so it's not a perfect image then you got it we got it you can choose you know you can either have a perfect image and wreck the book

51:06.455 --> 51:09.720
Or you can not wreck the book and have an imperfect image.

51:09.740 --> 51:10.541
Here's the problem.

51:10.882 --> 51:15.489
And we voted for imperfect images, again, because we're saying, well, this is an access project.

51:16.510 --> 51:21.278
And what we're trying to do is help people get access to some of this information.

51:21.318 --> 51:26.185
It's more important to us to preserve that cultural artifact.

51:26.435 --> 51:27.997
Now, there may be a few exceptions.

51:28.017 --> 51:29.839
I'm giving you a generalization, you know.

51:29.859 --> 51:34.944
But, I mean, it's more important for us to preserve the cultural artifact than to have perfection in reproduction.

51:35.245 --> 51:39.069
Well, Diane showed me a book yesterday that she's pulled in out of the selection room.

51:39.089 --> 51:43.474
I mean, this thing may stand one more pass through the fingers.

51:44.114 --> 51:46.377
There's no way this book's ever going to be preserved.

51:46.777 --> 51:51.863
And, in fact, it's doubtful that you could even get a good scanned copy of it.

51:51.883 --> 51:52.003
Right.

51:52.270 --> 51:56.374
something like this, fine.

51:56.434 --> 51:58.496
You might guillotine this thing and scoop it up.

51:59.277 --> 52:02.159
I don't even see how you could possibly copy it any other way.

52:02.340 --> 52:04.642
No, no, I agree.

52:04.662 --> 52:09.627
So there are going to be exceptions to this, but this is a policy is what you're telling me.

52:09.647 --> 52:10.267
Right.

52:10.708 --> 52:17.094
Yeah, what we would do is, and actually to go back to books, let me tell you something about the books as books that we've done.

52:17.974 --> 52:20.657
I think in the pilot, again...

52:21.700 --> 52:30.310
This is presumptions, you know, working on our presumptions, because it was rather hard to get feedback of the right sort quickly enough.

52:30.831 --> 52:44.307
The presumption was that computers are not the most graceful way to read a longer narrative work, you know, that it's probably not a good way to read narrative work.

52:44.327 --> 52:47.050
Do you know anyone who's ever read a book through on a computer?

52:47.789 --> 52:48.330
I don't.

52:48.470 --> 52:48.991
No, I don't.

52:49.291 --> 52:50.112
I don't.

52:50.473 --> 52:54.498
I've asked a lot of people that question, and they've all answered the same way.

52:54.679 --> 53:02.510
So we found ourselves wondering, well, if we get into book collections here at the Library of Congress, then which sort of books would it be that make the best fit?

53:02.770 --> 53:06.856
You know, it's the medium and the form and content, in effect, question.

53:07.617 --> 53:13.805
And we thought, well, there's a lot of interest in genealogy and there's a lot of interest in local history.

53:14.606 --> 53:16.429
If we gravitated...

53:16.780 --> 53:36.919
in a way, as we did with that WPA manuscript project, towards local history books or county histories or things that would be rich in words and terms and vignettes, you know, that would be rewarding to people with that curiosity.

53:37.459 --> 53:43.665
And we could see how, in a school situation, you know, a school teacher could really make some good use of this.

53:44.118 --> 53:46.781
But you begin to treat, and so that's what we did.

53:46.821 --> 53:50.967
So we had our first book collection, which has finally gotten online.

53:53.190 --> 53:56.134
It goes back several years and has many shortcomings.

53:56.214 --> 54:08.950
But I mean, it's sort of what we've been able to do is books about the state of California or from the movement of people into the state of California between the gold rush and the turn of the century.

54:08.970 --> 54:12.775
There's close to 200 books there, and they're fully searchable.

54:13.447 --> 54:20.393
So it means that if you have a curiosity about a place name or something like that, you know, you can find it.

54:20.493 --> 54:27.259
And our presumption, which again still is a presumption, is that people are going to isolate chapters or sections.

54:27.359 --> 54:30.442
In other words, they're going to treat it like a reference shelf in a way.

54:31.242 --> 54:42.492
And like a reference shelf, it would be, you know, it would probably be used in slices, you know, rather more than it's used in continuous narratives.

54:43.484 --> 54:44.685
The texts are there.

54:45.406 --> 54:47.528
It is possible to download the text.

54:48.909 --> 54:56.637
In theory, a person could print out a whole chapter on their laser printer and might find it more convenient to read it on paper.

54:58.359 --> 55:03.504
And I'd love to know what people are doing with it, and I think we'll find out over time.

55:04.225 --> 55:11.652
The next collections we're going to do continue in this vein with the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

55:12.256 --> 55:25.491
And we see if we can sort of keep plugging away at this, over a few years, we could give you local history resources and genealogical resources, kind of a big searchable bookshelf for the nation.

55:26.853 --> 55:31.959
The other place we've got books really do press more in the area of narrative.

55:32.539 --> 55:34.922
It's a small number.

55:35.965 --> 55:36.626
I don't know.

55:36.686 --> 55:39.489
I think the jury's still out on how useful they are.

55:39.529 --> 55:50.181
We put together a collection on the evolution of the conservation movement, and in fact it was supported by a gift from Lawrence Rockefeller, who does have high interest in conservation.

55:50.201 --> 55:58.750
And the person who compiled that collection for us took a slice of legal materials that reflect

55:59.472 --> 56:01.995
The period is 1850 to 1920.

56:02.236 --> 56:09.745
It's really focusing on late 19th century growth of this sense of a conservation movement and conservation of natural resources.

56:11.207 --> 56:16.954
Well before Teddy Roosevelt, but getting up towards Teddy Roosevelt's time and a little beyond.

56:18.997 --> 56:26.226
And the compiler went to the law library and got a lot of documents that had to do with U.S.

56:26.246 --> 56:28.669
government actions to establish...

56:29.273 --> 56:34.599
national forests and national parks or protected places in that period.

56:35.139 --> 56:47.233
She went to the photo division and got sort of a cross-section of pictorial materials that reflect the popular view and the popular imagination about beautiful places, especially in the West.

56:47.273 --> 56:58.285
You know, the movement into the Rockies after the Civil War, you know, the esthetification of the Rockies after the Civil War, you know, fed this sense of conservation.

56:58.687 --> 57:10.260
And she went to the bookshelves, as it were, and got, I think, I don't know, 40-some-odd books that include works by John Muir, which you'd expect.

57:11.381 --> 57:13.403
I think we've snuck Thoreau in there.

57:13.583 --> 57:16.146
No, he's the guru.

57:16.166 --> 57:17.888
And I can't remember.

57:17.908 --> 57:22.433
And then, you know, a number of rather more obscure books...

57:23.408 --> 57:30.443
including actually one or two by George Perkins Marsh, who was a particular favorite of Lawrence Rockefeller.

57:32.747 --> 57:38.539
And those books are, I don't know how sliceable they are.

57:38.740 --> 57:42.227
You know, they're findable because the full text is searchable.

57:43.186 --> 57:48.196
But, I don't know, I think we're just really interested to see what use is made of.

57:48.216 --> 57:49.058
Do you track that?

57:49.359 --> 57:51.343
Do you record hits and stuff like that?

57:51.363 --> 57:52.866
Well, we record hits.

57:53.487 --> 57:57.535
That's a crude instrument for determining real use.

57:57.736 --> 58:03.287
I mentioned that we have a user services group, and they've been—

58:03.875 --> 58:15.607
in some dialogue with a selected set of teachers, and they're, I believe, now planning to put a kind of an online questionnaire up, which would be voluntary, to try to get at it.

58:16.087 --> 58:21.913
I just got a thing from the New York Times, which I love their website.

58:22.594 --> 58:26.758
But, you know, how do they know who's reading it, how long they're reading it?

58:26.778 --> 58:31.823
So they just said they'll pay you if you'll come to a focus group.

58:32.056 --> 58:38.566
They really want to know who the hell is reading it and what they, you know, what's your time constraint?

58:38.806 --> 58:40.028
Oh, I've got about 15 minutes.

58:40.108 --> 58:42.472
I can go to 11 here and we'll go back.

58:42.512 --> 58:44.194
You're supposed to meet Steve Herman at 11.

58:44.214 --> 58:45.476
Yeah, that's good.

58:46.097 --> 58:48.621
But we're covering just about everything that I wanted to.

58:50.264 --> 58:51.746
Tell me a little bit about your background.

58:52.026 --> 58:54.851
Do you come out of the computer field?

58:55.592 --> 59:01.000
Well, I guess the most...

59:01.469 --> 59:31.358
sort of salient starting point is when I was a graduate student I went to fine arts school and ended up studying photography and motion pictures and where Ohio University has an MFA program in photography and film and I was hired then at a public television station in West Virginia and worked there for a while and through that whole period had interest in

59:32.333 --> 59:34.996
you know, folk music and bluegrass music.

59:35.657 --> 59:40.983
Like a lot of college students of my generation, you know, we remember the Hootenanny period and so on.

59:41.664 --> 59:45.588
But it got me into documenting folk culture.

59:45.928 --> 59:52.516
And after a half a dozen years in West Virginia, I was hired here at the Library of Congress to go to work for the American Folklife Center.

59:53.297 --> 01:00:00.585
And we worked on media documentation, or I was sort of the media documentation specialist with a bunch of field projects that we did.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:12.052
And in the course of that, it was, you know, the work included both archiving and organizing the archiving of multimedia materials.

01:00:12.132 --> 01:00:17.458
And at one point, we published a video disc that was kind of a multimedia package.

01:00:18.339 --> 01:00:19.020
No, it's still going.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.041
I thought I heard my beep.

01:00:20.061 --> 01:00:20.902
There's a beep there.

01:00:20.922 --> 01:00:21.363
All right.

01:00:21.783 --> 01:00:24.186
A multimedia package about a cattle ranch.

01:00:24.527 --> 01:00:29.172
And that got me...

01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:39.354
in touch with other people here at the library who were working on a computer optical disk project in the 80s.

01:00:39.494 --> 01:00:48.582
So I was sort of drawn in through media documentation and working at the Folklife Center at the library into the circle of people who were doing digital work here.

01:00:48.602 --> 01:00:59.732
And ultimately, you know, it got me in a position to be helpful with this pilot project.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:14.982
So I think my background is more in media and the use of media and an interest in the archiving of media documents in a sort of multimedia setting.

01:01:15.382 --> 01:01:24.015
I like that, and I know people I've talked to in France, for instance, these guys coming out of philosophy, you know, philosophers and historians.

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:29.021
as opposed to turning it over to the techies, you know, which is... You've got a broker.

01:01:29.221 --> 01:01:33.688
You've got a broker between the content and the technology somehow.

01:01:33.768 --> 01:01:37.934
And I think, you know, mediation and a writer does the same thing.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:42.621
I think a photographer, I mean, I've always worked as a still photographer, at least until recently.

01:01:43.883 --> 01:01:49.311
Now, again, you're at some nexus between content knowledge and...

01:01:50.033 --> 01:01:54.058
presentation or reporting or organizing, whatever it is.

01:01:54.238 --> 01:02:03.349
And I think part of the reason the digital projects here at the library succeed as well as they do is because it isn't just the computer guys that work on them.

01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:08.915
You've got to involve the content guys as well as the computer guys.

01:02:08.995 --> 01:02:10.958
And I think we've done that fairly well.

01:02:11.318 --> 01:02:13.501
That's a good one to quit on, if you want.

01:02:13.681 --> 01:02:15.383
Let me just ask you a question.
