00:01.820 --> 00:08.110
Here's another thing I figured out.

00:08.190 --> 00:16.362
Let's say you're in Mexico and it's 1950.

00:16.382 --> 00:18.445
And you have an aunt that dies.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.588
She leaves you 100 pesos.

00:22.872 --> 00:27.499
So you say a peso at that time was like 50 cents on the dollar.

00:27.659 --> 00:30.223
One American dollar would buy two pesos.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.834
because there's still gold and silver behind the peso.

00:34.854 --> 00:36.936
So you say, well, I don't need the hundred dollars.

00:36.956 --> 00:41.362
I'm going to put it away for savings.

00:41.382 --> 00:44.446
You know, hide it in the cookie jar, so to speak.

00:44.466 --> 00:50.854
So you go to the bank and you buy a 50 peso gold coin and you put away a 50 peso bill.

00:54.078 --> 00:55.500
Here it is, 1990.

00:55.520 --> 01:00.126
You say, well, I'm going to go, I remember that

01:00.713 --> 01:08.000
little savings I put away, I'm going to go and get it and see what I can get for it.

01:08.020 --> 01:19.651
That 50 peso gold coin's worth about 450 American dollars, and that 50 peso bill, American dollar, it's about 2,900 to one now.

01:20.292 --> 01:22.774
So you divide 50 into 2,900.

01:22.814 --> 01:27.919
You know, it takes 2,900 paper pesos to make a dollar where

01:28.422 --> 01:31.846
50 gold pesos equal 450 American dollars.

01:31.866 --> 01:33.988
That's how the government swindled people, currency.

01:34.008 --> 01:36.451
So that's why I was putting my money into that.

01:38.053 --> 01:53.670
Unless a hot bargain come along, like, you know, if I could buy a big collection of books or stained glass windows or something that I could work, that I needed for research or

01:54.393 --> 02:07.091
That Oregon collection that they described, was that one of your favorite collections?

02:07.111 --> 02:07.491
Oregon collections?

02:07.511 --> 02:11.918
The one that they came from Oregon that they described yesterday?

02:11.938 --> 02:13.380
The stuff that came from Oregon?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.061
Oh, not really.

02:14.081 --> 02:14.441
I don't know that.

02:14.461 --> 02:18.908
It seemed like the most intense, the most extensive single collection.

02:20.430 --> 02:21.711
Oh, what, the manuscripts?

02:21.732 --> 02:21.832
Yeah.

02:21.852 --> 02:22.813
No, I'm not familiar with manuscripts that much.

02:24.751 --> 02:29.717
They said $500,000, $600,000.

02:29.737 --> 02:39.290
No, that was the... I think that was that Norberg Chronicle stuff.

02:39.310 --> 02:40.732
No, no, I thought it was the guy from Oregon.

02:40.892 --> 02:43.435
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:43.455 --> 02:48.301
I never got a chance to research that stuff, to read it, to use it.

02:48.321 --> 02:49.663
I'm glad they got it back.

02:50.264 --> 02:52.146
That's salvation.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.408
I wish I could have read it.

02:55.058 --> 03:03.045
Now, is that something that you had actually wanted, or was it one of the opportunities that presented itself?

03:03.065 --> 03:05.927
Well, in a way, yeah.

03:05.947 --> 03:06.948
In a way, the latter?

03:06.968 --> 03:11.733
Yeah.

03:11.753 --> 03:22.061
Well, it may have been such a long time before they realized it wasn't there.

03:22.082 --> 03:22.182
Yeah.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.964
That one's just almost as wild as a piece of string.

03:25.653 --> 03:27.956
You're going to tell me about that.

03:27.976 --> 03:28.977
Oh, after the trial.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.262
Even if I shut this off?

03:33.322 --> 03:34.443
No, after the trial.

03:36.185 --> 03:38.428
OK.

03:38.908 --> 03:42.953
OK, good.

03:42.973 --> 03:47.238
Well, a person has to be resourceful, you know.

03:47.258 --> 03:50.181
I think this is a pleasant experience for all of us.

03:50.221 --> 03:51.082
Oh, yeah, Adam.

03:52.364 --> 03:53.805
Good to have you guys along.

03:53.825 --> 03:55.187
And with friends.

03:55.420 --> 03:56.341
Isn't it nice?

03:56.841 --> 03:57.001
Yes.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.945
Now, were you ever a Boy Scout or anything?

04:01.305 --> 04:02.046
I was a Cub Scout.

04:02.106 --> 04:03.847
Were you?

04:03.867 --> 04:08.652
Did you acquire a lot of this resourcefulness, do you think, from, uh... No, I acquired it.

04:09.012 --> 04:09.953
Scouting or...?

04:09.973 --> 04:13.496
I acquired it on the street, and the necessity's a mother of invention.

04:13.536 --> 04:20.862
I just sort of figured things out, you know.

04:20.882 --> 04:23.685
So you could really write a book, you know, about this.

04:23.705 --> 04:24.645
Oh, you think so.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.326
About this.

04:25.728 --> 04:26.649
Oh, yeah.

04:26.749 --> 04:29.332
Or we could really talk about it at length.

04:29.452 --> 04:36.420
I mean, I think people would be fascinated to learn how this was done.

04:36.980 --> 04:37.180
Oh.

04:37.481 --> 04:45.249
Not how for the sake of providing a blueprint, but I think the experiences, the anecdotal... Oh, yeah.

04:45.269 --> 04:47.191
Yeah, it was interesting.

04:47.211 --> 04:48.893
It was a high, you know.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.014
Was it a high?

04:51.015 --> 04:51.175
Yeah.

04:51.195 --> 04:53.558
Like digging in that box at an auction and...

04:55.276 --> 04:59.982
finding the last late-side classic you need to complete your set.

05:01.444 --> 05:13.501
In your mind's eye, was the scope of what you had established for yourself, for your collection?

05:13.521 --> 05:18.027
I didn't really understand the scope of it.

05:18.631 --> 05:20.533
I'm not talking about the massiveness.

05:20.593 --> 05:21.794
No, I mean the quality.

05:21.894 --> 05:27.760
The quality, but there was certainly, you understood the focus, because you established the focus, the focus of the collection.

05:28.001 --> 05:28.581
What do you mean?

05:28.661 --> 05:32.185
You're collecting areas, the particular areas.

05:32.205 --> 05:33.666
Well, I'd read of those areas.

05:33.746 --> 05:36.429
That's how I learned about them and was curious about them.

05:37.310 --> 05:44.117
But I'm saying, did you ever feel that you were close to completing the film for the collection?

05:44.137 --> 05:45.178
Yeah, I was getting there.

05:45.968 --> 05:50.836
I was right.

05:50.976 --> 05:57.787
I had a feeling I was getting close to the magnitude of Streeter in the Americana.

05:58.849 --> 06:01.994
I'd just love to see the bibliography and compare it.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.297
I've got a copy of Streeter.

06:04.397 --> 06:04.938
I have Streeter.

06:05.058 --> 06:06.200
I got it from Jenkins.

06:07.362 --> 06:09.065
I got mine from Gladly Martin.

06:09.165 --> 06:10.367
I got that at the Martin sale.

06:11.008 --> 06:12.330
And I'd like to compare

06:13.087 --> 06:19.414
If the government would do an accurate survey, I'd like to compare my... Of course, they're not going to break it down by subject.

06:19.494 --> 06:21.596
I think they're going to break it down by provenance.

06:21.656 --> 06:25.821
I don't think the government's capable of doing that kind of a bibliographic comparison.

06:26.181 --> 06:26.902
No, no, no.

06:26.922 --> 06:28.684
They're not capable of doing much of anything.

06:28.724 --> 06:38.354
I mean, you're asking now for a pretty sophisticated... I mean, let's be real here.

06:38.374 --> 06:41.758
They can't even use the word presently correctly.

06:41.778 --> 06:41.878
Yeah.

06:42.179 --> 06:45.184
But I could do that, go through there.

06:45.204 --> 06:53.077
In fact, in my own head, if you gave me a copy of Streeter, I could sit down and annotate that.

06:53.678 --> 06:55.041
I knew in my mind what I had.

06:55.061 --> 06:57.084
Was Streeter something of a model for you?

07:00.430 --> 07:01.812
Well, in imprints.

07:01.832 --> 07:03.435
He was real strong in imprints.

07:03.455 --> 07:08.203
Did you emulate a model for you to emulate the collector?

07:09.145 --> 07:10.607
Well, it depends.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.949
Streeter, like I say, I like it for imprints.

07:12.969 --> 07:15.912
He had, like, newspaper for his publishing and that.

07:15.932 --> 07:20.337
I'd say Brindley was more of a problem.

07:20.377 --> 07:21.618
Do you have a Brindley catalog?

07:21.678 --> 07:22.559
I have three sets.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.461
Oh, really?

07:24.621 --> 07:24.821
Yep.

07:25.682 --> 07:26.863
What do you need three for?

07:27.424 --> 07:28.265
Oh, I don't know.

07:28.325 --> 07:30.107
I just kind of got carried away with myself.

07:30.187 --> 07:31.949
Maybe I could buy one from you at some point.

07:34.151 --> 07:35.332
Well, you don't need three, do you?

07:36.293 --> 07:38.195
No, but the government has them.

07:38.215 --> 07:38.275
Oh.

07:38.795 --> 07:44.643
Do those belong to you, or will they go elsewhere?

07:45.004 --> 07:47.147
Well, one of them will be mine.

07:47.667 --> 07:48.949
Well, that's yours.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.431
I'm still going to find my Brindley.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.733
I don't know.

07:51.753 --> 07:54.157
You know, one of them is questionable.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.722
In their mind or in their minds?

07:57.742 --> 07:58.363
In their minds.

08:00.005 --> 08:01.026
So I may have one.

08:01.046 --> 08:02.288
I don't know.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.419
No, I thought you said you had three.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.082
Well, I did have three sets.

08:07.102 --> 08:08.904
I understand, but you don't really.

08:08.924 --> 08:11.527
You have one.

08:11.547 --> 08:12.168
One that's yours.

08:12.809 --> 08:13.269
Oh, yeah.

08:13.770 --> 08:16.293
Yeah.

08:16.313 --> 08:17.675
Ma and Pa Gas.

08:18.296 --> 08:18.496
Yeah.

08:22.140 --> 08:24.383
You need a fan belt on this, my friend.

08:24.403 --> 08:24.964
Yeah.

08:25.785 --> 08:27.207
It only does that after dark.

08:27.227 --> 08:27.607
I don't know.

08:27.647 --> 08:28.729
I work on it in the daytime.

08:28.789 --> 08:30.170
I can't get to do it.

08:30.190 --> 08:31.232
It's a weird thing.

08:31.392 --> 08:31.532
Mm-hmm.

08:32.255 --> 08:34.799
It's probably when it's cold, actually.

08:34.819 --> 08:40.527
You don't know if my engine's hot.

08:40.547 --> 08:43.611
And we're back in, uh... Oskaloosa, Iowa.

08:45.975 --> 08:48.378
This is where we had lunch or whatever.

08:48.398 --> 08:50.321
I've had a flight lunch.

08:50.341 --> 08:51.362
The chili was great.

08:52.404 --> 08:55.088
And the, uh, let me see if I can remember the name of that block.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.309
What, Kinkleman?

08:56.430 --> 08:58.292
The, uh... Frankel block.

08:58.372 --> 08:58.853
Frankel.

08:59.575 --> 09:06.661
You know, one of my favorite ethnic folk bands was a Jewish New York folk band.

09:06.681 --> 09:10.765
It was Lieutenant Josh Frankel's Yiddish Dance Band.

09:10.985 --> 09:20.754
And he was popular in New York around World War I, and I just loved his records, you know.

09:20.774 --> 09:27.300
The more contemporary band was a band called, I think, Marty Katz and his Katzenjammers.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.941
He was back in the 40s.

09:29.528 --> 09:33.835
But, you know, I like ethnic music.

09:34.696 --> 09:43.591
German military marches for Germany and Russian bala-laka orchestras for Russia and Jewish.

09:43.611 --> 09:47.537
Well, I'm Greek, you know, I do all of that.

09:47.872 --> 09:49.835
The Greek bouzoukia music.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.397
Oh, yeah.

09:51.557 --> 09:52.939
You probably haven't met many Greeks.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.221
There aren't many.

09:54.241 --> 09:55.202
There are some in Iowa.

09:55.222 --> 09:58.046
I meet them usually in restaurants.

09:58.086 --> 09:59.207
We own them.

09:59.227 --> 10:02.512
The Greeks own all the restaurants.

10:04.755 --> 10:11.684
That's right.

10:11.704 --> 10:11.985
You know them?

10:12.005 --> 10:14.668
I don't, I don't know.

10:14.688 --> 10:15.109
Johnny's best friend.

10:15.129 --> 10:15.870
There used to be a teak pole for him.

10:17.183 --> 10:28.260
It has been suggested, Stephen, that maybe this is a whistleblower suggestion by the defense, but we live in the Victorian age.

10:28.921 --> 10:29.642
Oh?

10:30.423 --> 10:32.025
Yeah.

10:32.045 --> 10:33.648
Do you think that's a preposterous suggestion?

10:33.728 --> 10:35.510
It would have been a better age to live.

10:35.610 --> 10:37.974
We really live the way we are.

10:38.034 --> 10:44.784
We're either influenced by what's outside of us or what's within us, you know.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.026
We can choose.

10:47.153 --> 10:58.529
to conform to the external things to a greater or less degree, or we choose not to.

10:58.549 --> 11:09.023
I don't know, maybe in somebody else's perspective, from the outside looking at me, because we all live within ourselves, you know.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.627
Maybe to some people it appears that way.

11:11.647 --> 11:13.089
To me it appears.

11:13.109 --> 11:15.152
You're living here and now in 1991.

11:17.478 --> 11:29.846
Well, kind of in contrast to it in some respects, but everything I have and do is all right to me, you know.

11:29.866 --> 11:32.773
Doesn't seem strange, but isn't that the way it is for all of us?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.918
Yep.

11:34.938 --> 11:35.098
Sure is.

11:40.124 --> 11:42.386
How many miles would you say this car has got on it?

11:42.406 --> 11:43.587
Oh, it doesn't have too many.

11:43.687 --> 11:44.688
The odometer's broke.

11:44.708 --> 11:45.269
I bought it.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.050
It had 21,000.

11:46.310 --> 11:48.512
It's got probably 60,000.

11:48.692 --> 11:49.533
It was one owner.

11:49.553 --> 11:50.594
You only had 21,000?

11:50.874 --> 11:53.157
Yeah, I bought it for 15 years.

11:53.357 --> 11:54.097
That's amazing.

11:54.138 --> 12:00.143
Yeah, it was from a one owner from an estate.

12:00.163 --> 12:03.266
You get 200,000 miles off of one of these old cabbies.

12:05.408 --> 12:06.610
You like American cars.

12:06.630 --> 12:07.851
You stick to American cars.

12:07.911 --> 12:09.152
None of these foreign jobs.

12:09.318 --> 12:10.980
Well, yeah, I do.

12:11.081 --> 12:13.925
I don't know if I could get a big old Mercedes or something.

12:13.965 --> 12:14.686
I'd travel.

12:14.706 --> 12:16.188
It's so hard to find parts.

12:20.054 --> 12:26.944
Yeah, I pretty much do.

12:26.965 --> 12:29.869
Now, you know, there was a, were you ever interested, like, in the Gronier 100?

12:29.929 --> 12:31.371
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:31.692 --> 12:33.975
I had that bibliography, and I had a,

12:34.613 --> 12:35.874
A number of those.

12:35.894 --> 12:38.037
Does that mean they mentioned the San Marano 80?

12:38.057 --> 12:41.020
You know, I was within two copies of that.

12:42.301 --> 12:42.922
Yes, I was.

12:43.963 --> 12:44.524
You had 78?

12:44.664 --> 12:45.365
Yes, I did.

12:45.385 --> 12:49.650
There were only two other people that had 80.

12:49.710 --> 12:54.995
Henry Clifford in the Yale, the Benecke Library at Yale.

12:55.176 --> 12:57.638
Yeah, the Benecke.

12:57.678 --> 12:57.879
Yeah.

12:58.099 --> 12:59.120
You had 78 barists?

13:00.682 --> 13:02.444
Yep.

13:02.464 --> 13:02.764
Wow.

13:03.402 --> 13:04.563
You want to shut that off?

13:04.884 --> 13:05.965
Yeah, sure.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.446
Let's do it again.

13:07.466 --> 13:08.467
What's the chase?

13:08.507 --> 13:09.248
The chase.

13:10.249 --> 13:16.035
It gets worse the closer you get to achieving the ultimate, doesn't it?

13:16.936 --> 13:17.977
It's agonizing.

13:18.077 --> 13:19.479
Sometimes you wish you hadn't started.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.485
You don't mean that, though.

13:25.945 --> 13:32.312
Let me say, even with knowing with everything that's happened and that's about to happen, do you regret any of it?

13:34.013 --> 13:35.876
You regret having put together that collection?

13:36.477 --> 13:43.046
Well, not putting together the collection, but I regret my inconsideration of others.

13:43.066 --> 13:47.393
I wouldn't do it again.

13:47.413 --> 13:52.500
Ray Cornell suggested to me once that you thought you were rescuing these things.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.662
Is that true?

13:53.762 --> 13:54.263
Yeah, yeah.

13:54.283 --> 14:01.033
Well, and all of it, you know, not only the books, but the doorknobs and the windows and the old house and even the people, Mr. Hall.

14:01.435 --> 14:04.159
Adam today has been exposed to.

14:06.603 --> 14:10.669
Tell me what you mean by rescuing them, rescuing these books.

14:10.769 --> 14:22.887
If these books are removed, say, from the archives, the locked archives of USC or wherever, you know?

14:23.067 --> 14:25.971
How is this an act of rescue?

14:25.991 --> 14:29.076
Well, that's rationalization on my part.

14:29.096 --> 14:29.957
I was sort of...

14:32.047 --> 14:33.288
Oh, let's put it this way.

14:33.308 --> 14:37.233
They were sort of on interlibrary loan to me.

14:37.253 --> 14:40.717
That's what I think.

14:40.737 --> 14:51.909
I don't know if they considered that.

14:51.929 --> 14:54.733
So you went up to Dartmouth, too?

14:54.753 --> 14:55.053
That's amazing.

14:55.073 --> 14:56.254
You went everywhere up to Hanover.

14:56.334 --> 15:01.260
You know, I've never been up to Hanover, New Hampshire, but I've lived in New England all my life.

15:02.084 --> 15:04.967
Because that's the way the heck up there, Hadover is.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.170
Yeah, I had a wonderful trip.

15:07.290 --> 15:08.050
It was in the winter.

15:08.071 --> 15:09.692
It took me a couple of months.

15:09.812 --> 15:15.479
I crossed over into Detroit, and I drove to Montreal, and stayed there a month, and then went down that way.

15:15.839 --> 15:18.702
Now, did you do any collecting up in Canada?

15:18.962 --> 15:19.283
Some.

15:21.906 --> 15:25.049
Did the same kind of procedures work up there as work down here?

15:25.069 --> 15:25.790
Oh, yeah.

15:25.810 --> 15:28.733
I didn't do that much of it.

15:29.759 --> 15:33.384
Uh, what I wanted to go up there to, but it was so damn cold and I was alone.

15:33.484 --> 15:41.796
I, the only place that I didn't get to that I wanted to get to was the Bibliothèque Laval.

15:42.557 --> 15:43.439
Laval University.

15:43.459 --> 15:45.441
And in, uh, Quebec.

15:45.682 --> 15:47.064
Oh, right.

15:47.084 --> 15:51.170
Oh, yeah, McGill.

15:51.190 --> 15:54.054
That's the McLennan Library.

15:54.074 --> 15:55.676
I didn't find McGill too fast.

15:55.937 --> 15:56.998
I've never been there.

15:58.042 --> 16:01.526
Yeah, it's right off, I think it's Dorchester Street.

16:01.546 --> 16:02.807
I didn't live too far from there.

16:02.827 --> 16:06.692
I lived in a rural San Loren or St.

16:06.732 --> 16:07.392
Louis Avenue.

16:09.295 --> 16:11.437
Yeah, that month I stayed in Montreal.

16:11.477 --> 16:16.923
There's the second largest Hispanic Jewish community in North America is up there.

16:17.003 --> 16:17.424
You know that?

16:18.465 --> 16:19.646
And I lived in that community.

16:19.666 --> 16:20.207
I enjoyed it.

16:20.868 --> 16:25.653
Were you thinking of taking your collection to Mexico?

16:25.693 --> 16:25.753
No.

16:26.510 --> 16:51.474
I didn't have any kind of preparation, no.

16:51.494 --> 16:52.415
I mean, is that a fabrication on Rhodes' Park?

16:52.435 --> 16:52.535
Yeah.

16:52.555 --> 16:54.137
You haven't done any research in Canada, huh?

16:54.590 --> 16:57.235
I'm pulling up to Toronto, maybe in February.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.461
Yes, there's a fantastic bibliography that's put out.

17:00.642 --> 17:01.904
It's all on handmade paper.

17:01.964 --> 17:07.755
It's a big folio of the, it's at McGill University now, Canadian Imprints.

17:07.775 --> 17:08.557
What is that called?

17:08.577 --> 17:09.498
It's a big volume.

17:09.518 --> 17:12.204
It's a bibliography, a great big thing in the limited edition.

17:12.224 --> 17:13.205
It's put out like 1960.

17:13.225 --> 17:15.370
It's a bibliography, right?

17:15.390 --> 17:18.235
Yeah, and it has its full page.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.583
Reproductions of what?

17:20.663 --> 17:22.045
Facsimile?

17:22.065 --> 17:25.752
Yeah, but it's on this handmade paper and three-quarter leather binding.

17:25.772 --> 17:27.676
What library is that?

17:28.577 --> 17:31.803
It's one of the famous collections up there.

17:31.823 --> 17:32.084
In Canada?

17:32.104 --> 17:34.729
I'm not familiar with the Canadian collection.

17:34.869 --> 17:38.616
If we could go through my books, I'd show it to you.

17:38.636 --> 17:41.160
It'll come to me eventually, but that's at McGill University.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.062
It's a Canadian influence.

17:44.793 --> 17:55.045
I just added some shelves in my house, you know, for my books.

17:55.846 --> 18:01.352
I mean, one of the great picks is just moving the books and putting them in the way you wanted.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.935
They were all in the perfect order up there.

18:04.436 --> 18:14.327
I had the Incanabula categorized by year, and I had the Americana by states and regions.

18:15.320 --> 18:20.987
little special collections within the collection, you know, the Ferry fishing collection.

18:22.369 --> 18:25.092
I understand they took you out to Omaha to see the stuff.

18:25.112 --> 18:25.793
Yeah.

18:25.813 --> 18:31.399
How did you feel when you went in there?

18:31.419 --> 18:34.523
Like I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

18:35.064 --> 18:36.225
Really?

18:36.245 --> 18:37.227
Was it pain?

18:37.247 --> 18:37.487
Yeah.

18:38.388 --> 18:40.490
Physical as well as emotional?

18:40.931 --> 18:42.593
I am mostly emotional.

18:44.362 --> 18:48.586
And did you see these other people handling them crudely?

18:49.347 --> 18:56.855
I didn't see them handling them crudely, but I seen them all out of order and seen that they'd been handled.

18:57.656 --> 18:58.977
Did that disturb you?

18:58.997 --> 18:59.177
Yeah.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.362
Well, and the fact they were out of order, too.

19:08.567 --> 19:11.650
But the collection is no longer a collection?

19:11.710 --> 19:11.770
No.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.428
Was it, in your view, a collection?

19:14.728 --> 19:15.989
Yeah.

19:16.009 --> 19:19.953
You know, a collection increases in value unto itself.

19:20.053 --> 19:21.635
That's right.

19:21.655 --> 19:23.076
It's synergistic, actually.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.920
Yeah, yeah.

19:26.940 --> 19:31.144
The sum of the whole is greater than its constituent parts.

19:31.164 --> 19:31.724
That's right.

19:33.566 --> 19:34.987
And that is true.

19:35.047 --> 19:39.011
That's the definition of a collection.

19:39.031 --> 19:39.291
Right, right.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.973
Yeah.

19:40.993 --> 19:42.094
Yeah, I wish I could get

19:42.715 --> 19:58.454
a copy of all the titles and then put them back in order and just see what the collection was like and compare it to other collections, you know.

19:58.474 --> 20:02.759
So you think you were close to Streeter and you think Brindley was in sight?

20:02.999 --> 20:04.281
Brindley was pretty tough.

20:04.341 --> 20:12.250
Yeah, real tough because of its time periods a hundred years before, but Brindley was the goal and Streeter I pretty much got to.

20:13.428 --> 20:16.536
Because Isaiah Thomas was a whole different breed altogether.

20:16.556 --> 20:16.877
Oh, yeah.

20:17.298 --> 20:18.421
He was imprints.

20:18.441 --> 20:19.864
He was imprints, newspapers.

20:19.884 --> 20:20.225
Yeah.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.413
Founder of the American Antiquarian Society.

20:23.453 --> 20:24.957
In Worcester, Mass, where I work.

20:25.418 --> 20:25.639
Yeah.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.143
Right down the street for me.

20:28.807 --> 20:30.712
Did you ever go through a Worcester?

20:30.732 --> 20:30.812
Yep.

20:31.315 --> 20:34.378
One of those weird towns where the streets go all over everywhere.

20:34.398 --> 20:35.459
I like it crisscrossed.

20:35.499 --> 20:37.922
Like, I'm a Midwesterner, you know, and you wind around.

20:38.002 --> 20:40.945
I mean, there are eight or nine colleges there.

20:40.965 --> 20:44.849
No major collections to speak of.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.051
But Holy Cross is there.

20:46.171 --> 20:47.092
Cloddard is there.

20:47.552 --> 20:49.795
Worcester Polytech is there.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.277
Robert Goddard invented the rocket there.

20:52.297 --> 20:53.118
Did you know that?

20:53.138 --> 20:53.539
Oh, yeah, no.

20:53.559 --> 20:55.721
Robert Goddard taught at Cloddard.

20:55.781 --> 20:59.685
In fact, I'm on the friends of the Goddard Library on the board.

21:03.091 --> 21:07.676
Worcester, but they call it Worcester.

21:07.696 --> 21:08.317
Worcester.

21:08.337 --> 21:14.725
You know, I used to have a game I used to play with people that I knew, you know, and that was lookalikes.

21:14.865 --> 21:17.288
And we'd travel through town after town.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.452
And the best thing about a lookalike is to have somebody else that knows the person with you.

21:21.873 --> 21:27.199
Well, I was in Worcester, and I went into a donut shop, and honest to God, I saw Dwayne Olsen there.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.221
And I was with Wally, who was a friend of his.

21:29.982 --> 21:31.444
A lookalike to Dwayne Olsen.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.683
And it was such a startling look-alike, I went up and stared at him.

21:34.723 --> 21:37.667
Then I went up and feigned using the phone, and I heard him in the background.

21:37.707 --> 21:38.948
He even had the same voice.

21:39.589 --> 21:43.994
So I said, I went out the car at the door, and I said, Wally, Dwayne's in there.

21:44.475 --> 21:46.076
So he went in, and he seen him.

21:46.116 --> 21:53.705
So what we'd do is, like you and I are old friends, and we have mutual associates, and we're traveling across the country.

21:53.725 --> 21:57.990
So we go up to that associate and says, we seen you in Worcester, Mass.

21:58.010 --> 21:58.731
And he'd say,

21:59.217 --> 22:00.899
I've never been to Worcester, Mass.

22:00.919 --> 22:01.921
What are you talking about?

22:02.221 --> 22:02.842
Ask Wally.

22:02.862 --> 22:03.703
He's seen him, too.

22:04.143 --> 22:07.047
You know, and it was sort of a game I used to play.

22:07.187 --> 22:12.434
I'll always remember that, so I saw Dwayne Olsen at Worcester, Mass.

22:12.454 --> 22:14.337
Now were you just passing through?

22:14.397 --> 22:25.792
No, I'd gotten a check in Brimfield, and I wanted to cash it, and I got in a fight with somebody in the bank because they wouldn't cash this check, and I'd sold some guys some windows.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.334
I hadn't made the sale by...

22:27.719 --> 22:38.475
partner had who I'd consigned stuff to, and the guy had an unpublished number, and it was on Saturday, and the bank wouldn't honor his check, and it was like the $1,300.

22:38.495 --> 22:43.382
I wanted some more money so I could buy some more books and antiques at Brimfield.

22:43.983 --> 22:49.391
As you know, the trouble with Brimfield is it's not like the Texas show where you go away with money.

22:49.411 --> 22:57.102
Every time I go to Brimfield, I go away broke with stuff because you can just, everything you make, you can spend because there's so much

22:57.368 --> 23:02.514
I wanted $1,300 more dollars, a stinking bank.

23:03.275 --> 23:04.416
They said the funds were there.

23:04.456 --> 23:09.822
The guy had like $50,000 in his account, but they wouldn't cash it because I didn't have a mass ID.

23:10.643 --> 23:15.008
I get frustrated with these bureaucrats and these bankers.

23:16.110 --> 23:18.172
He said, well, what's this Minnesota ID?

23:18.192 --> 23:19.434
I said, I'm from Minnesota.

23:19.874 --> 23:22.397
I said, if I had a mass ID, it wouldn't be legit.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.515
He said, well, we can't honor this.

23:24.795 --> 23:25.896
You don't have an account here.

23:25.977 --> 23:29.521
You don't have a mass ID, and we can't reach the fellow.

23:29.621 --> 23:33.466
I had to go all the way back to Minneapolis and deposit that check.

23:33.486 --> 23:34.728
Oh, that stinks.

23:34.748 --> 23:35.529
Yeah, and I was a little short.

23:35.669 --> 23:37.692
There were a few bargains I could buy because of that.

23:39.374 --> 23:47.524
My buddy I was telling you about that goes to New York with me, he goes to every Brimfield, and he's there at the opening bell at 5 o'clock in the morning.

23:48.112 --> 23:52.758
You do your fields every day, May's Field or Quaker's Agents.

23:53.018 --> 23:54.440
Oh, I do too.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.704
In fact, I've got a number of my paintings.

23:57.724 --> 24:00.328
I've got about eight or nine paintings in my notes with these mountains.

24:00.348 --> 24:03.832
I bought some great door knobs and a few hooks.

24:03.852 --> 24:11.622
What I have a nice collection of is that fresh.

24:11.642 --> 24:11.742
Yeah.

24:11.762 --> 24:14.986
Do people ski out here?

24:15.006 --> 24:16.588
It doesn't look like there are any bones really.

24:16.608 --> 24:17.089
That's pretty flat.

24:30.282 --> 24:35.268
Ironically, and just quite coincidentally, a very good friend of mine.

24:35.748 --> 24:39.172
One second, more prosecution.

24:39.232 --> 24:39.913
This is 27 more.

24:40.013 --> 24:40.814
Yeah.

24:40.834 --> 24:48.463
They're probably going to wrap it up, because according to the judge, he said he thought that the prosecution would close on Monday.

24:48.483 --> 24:49.264
I'm surprised at that.

24:49.284 --> 24:49.625
I can't.

24:49.645 --> 24:52.328
Well, they did throw stipulations.

24:52.348 --> 24:58.635
I know, but still, in addition to the stipulations and the ones that testified, there's still 27 more.

24:58.987 --> 25:02.530
I don't see how you can do 20 seconds in one day.

25:03.511 --> 25:04.232
I don't either.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.934
I'm just biting my tongue.

25:06.874 --> 25:09.377
Some I'd rather see to have eaten.

25:09.397 --> 25:10.618
I don't really see what they've got to do.

25:10.638 --> 25:12.860
I mean, what more can they do?

25:12.880 --> 25:17.344
Is there some you'd like to see to eat?

25:17.364 --> 25:21.808
Oh, some of my friends that they've intimidated.

25:21.828 --> 25:26.072
Poor Brian Toohey, they threw him in jail for eight months.

25:27.394 --> 25:28.875
Told him I ratted on him.

25:29.969 --> 25:32.852
And, you know, this Rhodes had taped it.

25:32.872 --> 25:35.994
The only way they got on him was with this driver's license.

25:36.014 --> 25:46.023
He wanted me to keep his ID, and I had it in the desk drawer, and they found him there in Rhodes and seen him on the way up and said all kinds of stuff about him.

25:46.043 --> 25:47.345
So they picked him up in L.A.

25:47.725 --> 25:48.766
He was a street kid.

25:49.046 --> 25:51.348
He was just living out there.

25:51.368 --> 25:56.473
Throw him in the cooler and said, well, we know this and this and this about you.

25:56.533 --> 25:57.173
Now you tell us.

25:58.655 --> 25:59.976
Steve told us that

26:01.964 --> 26:07.330
You did this, and this, and this, or you were involved in this, and this, and this, and Steve was involved in this, or whatever.

26:07.350 --> 26:18.724
So you either tell us, he's told us about you, so come clean, or we're going to do 10 years, so we can't.

26:18.744 --> 26:22.008
And then they gave him a lawyer, and he pled him in 24 hours.

26:23.690 --> 26:25.572
I'm surprised the judge had let that pass.

26:26.994 --> 26:29.777
They like people to talk to us.

26:33.925 --> 26:44.577
Well, he's done eight months in a jail, and they're going to, that's his sentence, like time served, and then they're going to let him go, so he's going to walk.

26:45.878 --> 26:49.883
Yeah, but he had a pretty bad drug cocaine habit.

26:49.943 --> 27:00.675
In fact, he was selling it on the street out there, and he came out to Iowa because he wanted to, I don't know drugs, and he wanted to dry out.

27:01.313 --> 27:26.663
had like run away from home he wanted to get in the drug-free environment and get back with me and uh uh try to straighten himself out but he said he had some withdrawal pains and he got some snakey in houston that i had to put him i bought him a bus ticket to l.a and he went out there and he was wanted on some traffic tickets or something he wanted me to hold his id and he said by the time you get back up to iowa

27:27.554 --> 27:36.047
I'll just have gotten another fix, or whatever they do, and got myself straightened out, and I'm going to try another shot at cleaning my addiction up.

27:36.868 --> 27:37.729
Well, they never made it.

27:37.809 --> 27:45.300
I got back north, got busted, and they found his ID, and they scooped him up out there, and had him in the cooler since July.

27:48.605 --> 27:51.770
Telling him I betrayed him, you know, that's the worst thing, is telling him.

27:51.790 --> 27:53.713
I don't think it's, yeah, yeah, it is.

27:56.393 --> 28:01.077
Did you ever have your IQ tested?

28:01.097 --> 28:06.142
No, I don't know what it is.

28:06.162 --> 28:11.447
It's got to be very high.

28:11.467 --> 28:11.787
Do you think so?

28:11.807 --> 28:15.611
Yeah, because I don't know the dates.

28:15.631 --> 28:16.392
Where are the dates?

28:16.412 --> 28:17.473
It's a man of concepts and language.

28:17.493 --> 28:22.637
I haven't thrown anything at him, but he hasn't had it.

28:22.657 --> 28:23.278
Has Roger started coming in?

28:24.119 --> 28:32.154
I've seen, I don't know, Henry Elton's Widener.

28:32.174 --> 28:33.397
Not Harry Widener.

28:33.417 --> 28:34.078
No, Harry.

28:34.098 --> 28:36.402
The one that died on the Titanic.

28:36.603 --> 28:37.805
He's in my book, too.

28:37.825 --> 28:38.787
Harry's in my book.

28:39.188 --> 28:46.297
There's some... I read one of these anecdotes of books that he died clutching his tomes and he bought at a sale.

28:46.317 --> 28:49.341
He went over there to a sale, you know.

28:50.182 --> 28:52.665
The story is... Did you say that you had an early edition of Bacon's essay?

28:52.685 --> 28:54.968
Early edition of Bacon's essay.

28:55.088 --> 28:56.069
It was a full reel.

28:56.530 --> 28:57.471
Oh, that was a full reel.

28:57.531 --> 28:57.631
Okay.

28:57.671 --> 29:00.575
Well, what Harry had was in that babble, I think.

29:00.595 --> 29:00.775
Oh, yeah.

29:00.795 --> 29:03.398
It was a small one.

29:03.899 --> 29:04.019
Yeah.

29:04.039 --> 29:06.101
Why do you remember our collection?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.423
He came with our collection, too.

29:07.403 --> 29:08.224
Harry was?

29:08.385 --> 29:09.066
Sure he was.

29:09.126 --> 29:14.175
I'd just can't fall.

29:15.216 --> 29:23.370
I've got Harry's own catalog of his collection that he issued prior to his death.

29:23.391 --> 29:25.354
All of his books of his own collection.

29:25.534 --> 29:28.860
This is while he's still alive.

29:29.020 --> 29:30.823
That's a nice one.

29:30.883 --> 29:31.825
That's nice.

29:33.087 --> 29:36.652
Well, his father had a beautiful Victorian turret at home.

29:36.672 --> 29:39.516
It was like a six-story job on Broad and Girard.

29:40.738 --> 29:44.524
And the family donated to the city for a branch library.

29:44.944 --> 29:47.908
And the city sold it or leased it.

29:48.149 --> 29:52.916
When I was there about 12, 15 years ago, it was a black church.

29:53.557 --> 29:56.962
Because North Broad Street out by Temple University is a real bad neighborhood.

29:57.643 --> 30:00.667
And they ran into financial problems or something.

30:00.707 --> 30:02.790
And the place, after I

30:03.715 --> 30:26.787
seen it, got empty vandalized and burned down, and what a oh it was an incredible mansion you know of the fifth avenue caliber. You know they had this three-story huge art gallery behind it it was just an incredible like a wedding cake. It went up. Oh yeah I know. He wrote the rose yeah

30:27.172 --> 30:30.315
He was able to speak to me both about Rosenbach.

30:30.335 --> 30:32.096
He worked for him.

30:32.276 --> 30:35.559
He and John Fleming had the book.

30:36.520 --> 30:41.564
And then he also was able to tell me about the library company in Philadelphia, which is quite interesting.

30:41.604 --> 30:42.945
Franklin did that.

30:42.965 --> 30:44.207
Franklin did, that's correct.

30:44.227 --> 30:46.769
Now, you know who the first great book collector was?

30:47.409 --> 30:50.472
Laws of Pennsylvania, 1744.

30:50.532 --> 30:51.473
You had a copy of that?

30:51.533 --> 30:51.953
Yeah.

30:51.973 --> 30:53.074
What was it, Franklin?

30:53.134 --> 30:56.537
Laws of Pennsylvania, with a Franklin entrance.

30:56.939 --> 31:10.231
Frankly, everything is so desirable.

31:10.251 --> 31:17.278
This is a wonderful splendid job.

31:17.298 --> 31:17.878
Where did that one come from?

31:17.898 --> 31:18.359
Well, it was a bargain.

31:18.379 --> 31:19.600
But it's one that probably won't be going back to the tumble.

31:19.620 --> 31:20.040
Oh, sad to see.

31:20.060 --> 31:25.005
Well, for a year and a half, the tumble was...

31:27.230 --> 31:32.435
a literary spot, an unknown literary jewel in the Midwest.

31:33.836 --> 31:35.318
Was it called an unknown?

31:35.338 --> 31:39.321
Ottumbo, Iowa, was an unknown literary jewel.

31:41.403 --> 31:45.007
Bibbophiles jewel.

31:45.027 --> 31:51.253
But maybe it's only claimed to history in the future, other than having a big slaughterhouse there that closed.

31:51.273 --> 31:54.836
That's the reason why the town exists there.

31:54.856 --> 31:55.937
No culture, but...

31:57.925 --> 32:03.031
I'm in a negative fashion, one of the things that will be noted.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.833
Yeah, Adam?

32:07.636 --> 32:08.417
Oh, somewhat.

32:08.437 --> 32:12.162
I'm interested in black holes and antimatter.

32:15.546 --> 32:20.131
Yeah, well, years ago, people used to navigate by those, you know.

32:20.171 --> 32:20.832
They still do.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.153
I went to Naval Office of Canada School.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.275
I was in Naval Office.

32:23.295 --> 32:26.158
Oh, they still have to study celestial navigation.

32:26.178 --> 32:26.278
Yeah.

32:27.845 --> 32:32.472
I'm interested in black holes because they claim stars are like sun.

32:33.093 --> 32:41.786
They're matter-emitting energy, but they're also like black holes or black stars that are matter that attract energy.

32:41.806 --> 32:43.148
They'll even attract light.

32:43.528 --> 32:44.450
That's right.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.611
Isn't that incredible?

32:45.731 --> 32:48.175
That's why, supposedly, you can't see them.

32:48.195 --> 32:48.375
Yeah.

32:48.395 --> 32:50.178
They consume all the way.

32:50.659 --> 32:50.779
Yeah.

32:50.799 --> 32:54.865
Black holes, black , black .

32:55.621 --> 33:04.675
that stars are like, matter is like in a pendulum of eons of years.

33:05.296 --> 33:18.237
It'll be like a sun emitting energy so long until it's spent and then it goes into an anti-matter where it absorbs energy to a certain degree and then it explodes into emitting.

33:18.757 --> 33:22.602
and then it goes back into absorbing as sort of a pendulum.

33:22.622 --> 33:27.869
That's just theory in my head.

33:27.889 --> 33:29.811
I don't know if there's any scientific basis, but have you ever considered that?

33:29.831 --> 33:30.292
It's fascinating.

33:30.312 --> 33:34.898
The heavens, the heavens absolutely astound me.

33:34.918 --> 33:36.620
Would you agree with me?

33:36.640 --> 33:37.922
Being Greek?

33:37.942 --> 33:40.505
Greek mythology?

33:40.525 --> 33:42.828
Well, it's even more than being Greek.

33:42.848 --> 33:44.009
It is not mythology.

33:44.029 --> 33:48.375
It's just how enormous and unfathomable it is.

33:48.608 --> 33:58.500
But yet the smallest thing in matter, as well as the largest thing, there's a nucleus, which is the sun, with rotating

33:59.493 --> 34:04.500
objects which are like planets and an atom is a nucleus with rotating electrons.

34:04.560 --> 34:09.707
I've often thought in moments of whimsy, you know, that maybe we're on a small atom someplace.

34:09.727 --> 34:13.713
Maybe we are part of a toenail on a leopard or something.

34:13.813 --> 34:15.455
Yeah, I thought of that too.

34:15.495 --> 34:15.976
Really?

34:15.996 --> 34:16.196
Yeah.

34:16.356 --> 34:20.121
Because if you look at them, they look precisely the same.

34:20.141 --> 34:20.482
Yeah, yeah.

34:20.622 --> 34:21.303
Yeah, I've observed that too.

34:21.343 --> 34:23.826
Yeah.

34:23.846 --> 34:24.487
And who knows?

34:24.607 --> 34:28.132
I mean, as my friend Shakespeare said, I love Shakespeare.

34:28.152 --> 34:28.673
I just love Shakespeare.

34:29.210 --> 34:32.934
I had a wonderful Shakespeare portfolio.

34:32.994 --> 34:36.419
1683, wait a minute.

34:36.439 --> 34:43.166
Yeah, I think the illustrations of Shakespeare have been taken out of another volume, remounted.

34:43.587 --> 34:50.856
But it was the largest... It was the largest copy in Southern California.

34:50.876 --> 34:58.845
It even exceeded the Huntington Library copy, because you know how they've all been trimmed to a certain degree, but this was the...

34:59.197 --> 35:00.499
least cut.

35:00.519 --> 35:01.701
It had been cut.

35:01.721 --> 35:04.405
But you don't think it was the original frontispiece?

35:04.526 --> 35:08.452
No, I think it, well, it was an original from another copy.

35:08.472 --> 35:09.253
Oh, it was.

35:09.293 --> 35:09.854
That's nice.

35:09.934 --> 35:11.697
It's still the most desirable thing.

35:11.717 --> 35:14.862
Yeah, but it was an original to the book itself.

35:15.423 --> 35:17.567
But it was the original copper plate.

35:17.587 --> 35:19.009
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:19.590 --> 35:21.673
Portrait pulled from that plate.

35:21.753 --> 35:25.339
Yeah, after this is over, I'll tell you where you'll be able to see it.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.561
Or maybe I'll have to get it back to where it belongs.

35:28.581 --> 35:28.922
I don't know.

35:31.505 --> 35:36.212
Did you ever try to get a course for you?

35:37.454 --> 35:38.976
I wasn't into Shakespeare that much.

35:39.056 --> 35:39.797
I would have liked to.

35:39.818 --> 35:43.503
You know what the ultimate manuscript is, literary manuscript?

35:45.305 --> 35:47.328
It's a Shakespeare signature.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.333
But there's some question as to whether Shakespeare exists.

35:50.353 --> 35:52.997
You know, there's nothing in manuscript by Shakespeare.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.360
No, I'm quite knowledgeable in the study of Shakespeare.

35:56.285 --> 35:59.089
Nothing's ever turned up on Shakespeare.

35:59.109 --> 36:01.273
Well, yes, well, there is, actually.

36:02.114 --> 36:02.956
Isn't it questionable?

36:02.976 --> 36:05.299
Wasn't he assuading him for Bacon?

36:05.319 --> 36:05.640
No.

36:05.660 --> 36:10.948
There's some controversy about that.

36:10.968 --> 36:16.657
You know, as I say, if Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare, it was somebody who was Shakespeare.

36:16.677 --> 36:17.639
Who was capable of writing?

36:17.659 --> 36:20.183
You see, they don't like to acknowledge the Shakespeare.

36:20.467 --> 36:23.270
It's come up in his hand, though, hasn't it?

36:23.290 --> 36:25.974
Well, there are six known signatures.

36:25.994 --> 36:26.334
Oh, there are.

36:26.354 --> 36:28.016
Three of them are on his will.

36:28.036 --> 36:30.079
Three are on other documents.

36:30.099 --> 36:36.807
There's a document in the British Library called, and it's an unfinished fragment.

36:37.007 --> 36:46.339
It's an unfinished play, but it is about a local Minnesota author who wrote that Shakespeare was a

36:47.332 --> 36:54.198
His name was Ignatius Donnelly, and he was an early territorial pioneer and writer in Minnesota.

36:54.378 --> 37:01.525
It's odd that something of a literary nature like that would come out of Minnesota in the middle 19th century.

37:01.545 --> 37:03.106
These theories are endemic.

37:03.126 --> 37:07.010
I mean, they appear constantly.

37:08.671 --> 37:12.755
But there has never been anything persuasive.

37:12.775 --> 37:17.119
You see, the shape of playwrights in those days were not reputable people.

37:17.403 --> 37:21.009
Yeah, actors even up to the mid-19th century were thought of.

37:21.029 --> 37:22.711
They couldn't stay in a well.

37:22.731 --> 37:27.178
Right across the street from the Globe Theater was the Bear Garden.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.221
And you know what they did at the Bear Garden?

37:29.241 --> 37:32.967
They made it to Adam.

37:33.448 --> 37:35.270
I keep forgetting his name.

37:35.290 --> 37:42.862
Kevin, they're not going to go back to East High School and they're going to be exposed to a cultural conversation like they're having.

37:42.982 --> 37:44.384
I hope they're enjoying it.

37:44.404 --> 37:45.486
Oh, I'm sure they are.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.053
And that's one thing.

37:48.093 --> 37:53.819
I like to bring culture to people that art don't always have.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.040
You have to seek it out.

37:56.121 --> 37:59.023
It's stimulating when it comes.

37:59.504 --> 37:59.704
Yeah.

37:59.744 --> 38:03.688
Of course, you're so refreshing because I can communicate.

38:03.708 --> 38:06.170
We sort of hit it off.

38:06.270 --> 38:07.291
I think we have that way.

38:07.311 --> 38:09.113
Yeah.

38:09.133 --> 38:10.314
I think we can be friends.

38:10.815 --> 38:12.836
Yeah.

38:12.896 --> 38:14.578
And I want you to know that

38:15.166 --> 38:19.236
I'm not going to hurt you in this book.

38:19.256 --> 38:19.838
Oh, I didn't think you would.

38:19.858 --> 38:21.803
I'm going to tell the story.

38:21.843 --> 38:22.564
You know that.

38:22.585 --> 38:22.805
Yeah.

38:23.306 --> 38:23.747
You know that.

38:23.908 --> 38:24.128
Yeah.

38:25.732 --> 38:26.494
It's out in here.

38:27.056 --> 38:28.399
Well, I'm going to tell it right.

38:29.628 --> 38:34.235
I'm going to report what goes on in that courtroom.

38:34.255 --> 38:40.986
I'm going to write about this day today that we've spent.

38:41.006 --> 38:42.789
I'm so excited about what's happened today.

38:42.889 --> 38:44.611
That's why I wanted to get to you.

38:44.631 --> 38:46.795
You can't be told about my life.

38:46.815 --> 38:50.300
You have to live it.

38:51.021 --> 38:52.023
It's been wonderful.

38:53.205 --> 38:53.485
Thank you.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.649
It's a great moment for me.

38:55.669 --> 38:56.109
It really is.

38:56.129 --> 38:57.171
I mean, there's a lot of sincerity.

38:59.682 --> 39:04.587
One of the wonderful things I think my book is going to do is that I have done nothing for clips.

39:04.928 --> 39:10.133
You know that newspaper man, but that's the newspaper man's impression.

39:10.154 --> 39:11.055
I like Iowa.

39:11.075 --> 39:19.584
There's a beauty and an innocence and a youthfulness to Iowans, but it's somewhat of a culture shock to me because I'm an urbanite like you are.

39:19.664 --> 39:21.366
How many apples is it?

39:21.386 --> 39:23.789
It's a major city.

39:23.809 --> 39:25.150
I'm an urbanite, you know.

39:27.138 --> 39:35.035
And it's been a learning thing down here in Iowa in that, you know, I can see... It is something.

39:35.055 --> 39:38.382
It is rather ironic in a way, isn't it?

39:38.402 --> 39:46.699
That all these libraries and all these imputables and all these imprints and all this discussion of book plates

39:47.050 --> 39:50.754
should be happening in the morning.

39:51.075 --> 39:52.096
Or come to Iowa, yeah.

39:52.136 --> 39:55.680
Well, I mean, but even the forum where he's being judged.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.961
It's an anachronism.

39:56.981 --> 39:57.682
It is.

39:57.782 --> 40:05.952
I keep looking at those 14 people in the jury box, and I say, what are they making out of this?

40:05.972 --> 40:07.914
They're going to sleep somehow.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.317
Yeah, but I mean, I am fascinated.

40:10.337 --> 40:12.980
I know Ray looked at me yesterday, and he said, you were really excited.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.762
But he says, oh, isn't it?

40:15.130 --> 40:15.971
Do I have to hold on?

40:15.991 --> 40:19.116
He was really excited about that Nuremberg Chronicle.

40:19.136 --> 40:20.398
I said, that's an exciting book.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.501
I said, but you've got to know it.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.703
You've got to know it to know.

40:23.743 --> 40:27.288
I mean, you've got to be one to appreciate what I'm feeling.

40:28.109 --> 40:29.211
And it was excitement.

40:29.231 --> 40:35.880
And I have to say that woman generated the excitement, didn't she?

40:35.900 --> 40:37.082
Lenderie?

40:37.122 --> 40:38.945
Oh, yeah.

40:38.965 --> 40:43.872
She started to get into it, to explain what this book was.

40:45.303 --> 40:46.425
You know, she had it.

40:46.445 --> 40:47.466
She had a feeling.

40:47.486 --> 40:49.489
Yes, she did.

40:49.509 --> 40:53.694
I liked Hymas, or Tyrus Hermanson, too.

40:53.714 --> 40:54.716
Now, which one was that?

40:54.736 --> 40:56.438
From the Occidental College.

40:56.638 --> 40:57.600
Yeah.

40:57.620 --> 41:01.325
I've never met a fellow from the San Marano College.

41:03.087 --> 41:07.954
But I have to say, some of the questions of him were naive, too.

41:08.214 --> 41:10.517
Why didn't they do an inventory when they moved in here?

41:11.122 --> 41:13.044
There was no reason to.

41:13.064 --> 41:17.749
We were moving it from one large storage space to another large storage space.

41:17.769 --> 41:21.252
Yeah, do you remember that?

41:21.272 --> 41:21.412
Yeah.

41:21.532 --> 41:28.239
We were going to a meeting of the Zamorano Palton.

41:28.259 --> 41:34.405
I wonder.

41:34.425 --> 41:34.685
I don't know.

41:34.705 --> 41:36.987
I don't know if we can answer this.

41:37.007 --> 41:38.389
Who's to say, Stephen, who knows?

41:38.409 --> 41:39.410
I wish some, what do I know?

41:39.430 --> 41:39.610
I hope.

41:40.855 --> 41:44.400
That, uh, we've come out of this, okay?

41:44.420 --> 41:49.267
Yeah.

41:49.287 --> 41:50.228
Can we stop there after that?

41:50.389 --> 41:50.789
Oh, yeah.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.093
That's a place called FUNK Seeds.

41:53.173 --> 41:53.353
F-U-N-K.

41:53.533 --> 41:57.078
Is that a C, or is that the name of a guy that does it?

41:57.098 --> 42:00.103
No, that's the Grand Seeds.

42:00.123 --> 42:00.824
Is that right?

42:00.844 --> 42:03.167
So that's for corn, right?

42:03.187 --> 42:03.488
I suppose.

42:03.508 --> 42:04.289
I keep thinking you're in Iowa.

42:04.309 --> 42:06.051
I don't even know the answer to that.

42:06.071 --> 42:06.672
No, I'm in Indiana Power.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.154
I'm like, I don't know what I keep thinking.

42:08.174 --> 42:08.915
There you go.

42:08.935 --> 42:09.737
I don't even know.

42:09.757 --> 42:10.778
I'm in Indiana.

42:13.272 --> 42:21.227
Are you indifferent to food and things, Steve?

42:21.307 --> 42:22.769
Oh, I love it.

42:22.789 --> 42:23.090
Do you?

42:23.110 --> 42:23.952
Nice food.

42:23.972 --> 42:29.041
The only thing, I don't like seafood, but I like Italian food or ethnic foods.

42:30.403 --> 42:35.693
The best Chinese restaurants I've eaten in is up in Toronto and Chinatown.

42:35.713 --> 42:36.715
They're just superb.

42:36.948 --> 42:39.470
Well, Canada's great all over for ethnic.

42:40.071 --> 42:42.853
They have such an ethnic... Toronto in particular.

42:42.873 --> 42:46.136
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's... Ah, that's an ethnic Mecca.

42:46.156 --> 42:47.638
I stayed in Toronto for a while.

42:47.698 --> 42:48.618
It's a nice city.

42:48.638 --> 42:50.060
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.503
Going up there and taking my wife with me as an airbag.

42:53.763 --> 42:57.647
I used to stay on Jarvis off of Dundas, and I'd catch the streetcar.

42:57.747 --> 43:02.951
Dundas has a street, a trolley car yet, you know, and I'd take that into Chinatown.

43:02.991 --> 43:04.913
Chinatown's along Dundas.

43:05.450 --> 43:11.818
can eat in those restaurants.

43:11.838 --> 43:15.962
Yeah, that's crazy.

43:15.982 --> 43:19.567
Oh, to travel again, you know.

43:19.587 --> 43:35.085
Do you think that, this is a personal question, but don't answer what you're going to, but do you think that you will need some help of some sort of the kind that they think that you might be quiet, even if you're a call?

43:36.938 --> 43:46.110
I wonder if they can give it to me, but yeah, after they put me through this, yeah, it's unnerving.

43:46.551 --> 43:49.575
I'm going to try to get things together.

43:50.396 --> 44:01.090
As far as help for what they want me to stop doing, my covers won't.

44:02.251 --> 44:05.294
I mean, the cover's blown.

44:05.454 --> 44:08.217
Is that the only reason why you wouldn't do it again?

44:08.897 --> 44:10.959
Well, that and the remorse.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.482
You recognize the wrongness of it.

44:13.602 --> 44:16.184
Yeah.

44:18.426 --> 44:19.107
Yeah.

44:19.127 --> 44:25.873
I mean, did they make you aware of certain things about yourself that you might agree are true?

44:26.514 --> 44:30.017
Or do you disagree with them?

44:30.037 --> 44:31.819
Or do you think maybe...

44:32.744 --> 44:39.030
And again, if this is an area you don't want to touch, that's fine.

44:39.050 --> 44:41.133
They've made me much more fearful of them.

44:41.153 --> 44:42.354
I didn't trust them to begin with.

44:43.155 --> 44:43.795
Peerful of what?

44:44.456 --> 44:44.976
Of them.

44:45.477 --> 44:46.618
Their coldness.

44:47.179 --> 44:48.260
You're talking about?

44:48.280 --> 44:52.644
The government and the manner of handling this.

44:52.744 --> 45:00.372
If they'd have got a guy like you to befriend me over a period of time, I think

45:01.921 --> 45:09.252
You as a friend spending some time with me, you know, and it would have been worth $50,000 to get a nice guy like you.

45:09.272 --> 45:12.777
You probably could have convinced me to mend my ways.

45:13.318 --> 45:18.566
It would have been a gentle... And I wouldn't have taken any money for it either.

45:18.586 --> 45:18.946
Yeah.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.088
I mean, that's not the kind of thing.

45:20.108 --> 45:22.391
They went about it in such a brutal manner.

45:22.411 --> 45:23.152
That's blood money.

45:23.173 --> 45:27.739
That's blood money.

45:27.900 --> 45:28.020
Yeah.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.582
And it speaks of them, you know.

45:30.423 --> 45:57.510
between eight and one you know I'd be interested now well of course they'll probably figure out what's happened about what Rhonda thinks of me you know of course I don't really

45:58.165 --> 46:01.570
Do you think we should call him?

46:01.590 --> 46:06.678
Do you want to call him and let him know that they shouldn't worry or something, or what?

46:06.698 --> 46:09.261
Well, I don't quite know what his angle is.

46:09.281 --> 46:24.023
I hope it's... I don't completely understand Ray, and I hope it's... He gets mad if I do impulsive things, but the impulsive things I've done so far in this case have been to my benefit.

46:24.444 --> 46:24.544
Yeah.

46:26.515 --> 46:38.905
You're not going to experience what it is to be with me and my associates and what it was to be there without me, you know.

46:38.925 --> 46:40.407
All that was missing was the books.

46:43.730 --> 46:46.132
You know, you're with the type of people I went with.

46:48.574 --> 46:51.036
You ate in the places I ate in.

46:51.056 --> 46:56.100
You rode the kind of cars I do on the highways like I do.

46:56.603 --> 46:57.945
We didn't do any collecting.

46:58.726 --> 47:00.128
I'm not in the position to do it.

47:00.368 --> 47:05.536
We talked about it.

47:05.556 --> 47:05.656
Yeah.

47:05.676 --> 47:08.881
And you can draw your own analogies from it.

47:08.901 --> 47:09.001
Yeah.

47:09.021 --> 47:11.444
Tell me about the thrill of discovery.

47:11.464 --> 47:12.987
Let's talk about the joys of collecting.

47:13.567 --> 47:21.098
Finding something that's totally extraordinary and wonderful.

47:21.178 --> 47:21.879
Isn't that great?

47:21.899 --> 47:25.885
Can you think of anything that you found?

47:26.438 --> 47:29.262
quite legitimately, let's say, in a barn.

47:30.283 --> 47:31.605
Well, I can tell you something.

47:31.685 --> 47:33.287
I was in Troy, New York.

47:34.028 --> 47:35.250
I was down this area.

47:36.411 --> 47:38.414
There was a burned-out brownstone.

47:38.434 --> 47:40.377
All of this left was the facade.

47:40.657 --> 47:41.498
There was nothing.

47:42.239 --> 47:47.286
You go through the second set of front doors, and there was no building left.

47:49.929 --> 47:51.011
And it's just the front.

47:51.071 --> 47:52.793
You know how the row houses are cast?

47:53.234 --> 47:56.378
I went up there, and there was a brand for

47:57.556 --> 48:03.185
1884 pattern knob on the front door I wanted to get, and I got that.

48:03.646 --> 48:21.453
I looked in at the second set of double doors, and there was a Ludwig Kruzinger doggy knob, which is the Shakespeare first folio of doorknob collectors on this door of this derelict building, and I got it.

48:22.615 --> 48:25.740
How far in terms of the book did you go?

48:34.833 --> 48:36.636
Oh, there's so many of them, you know.

48:39.159 --> 48:41.422
I'm going to tell you the title of my book, all right?

48:41.442 --> 48:43.125
Oh, thank you.

48:43.245 --> 48:47.491
I consider it an honor that you include me in the chapter of the book.

48:47.932 --> 48:48.513
Do you?

48:48.533 --> 48:49.153
Yeah.

48:49.174 --> 48:50.736
And you don't mind the title of the book?

48:50.756 --> 48:50.996
No.

48:51.297 --> 48:52.558
Do you like the title of the book?

48:52.578 --> 48:53.420
No, I like it.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.902
It's going to sell books, by the way.

48:55.402 --> 49:01.471
I could call it book collectors and book collecting, you know, past and present, blah, blah, blah.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.215
But I thought that was a nice...

49:05.275 --> 49:35.215
a nice title that describes passion i'm writing about passion oh yeah i'm writing about human nature as much as i am writing about anything else and when i write about these people i'm writing about myself as well yeah because i bring this love you know my job i don't know if you know what my job is i mean i'm egotist in there yeah it's me me me you know i love me yeah one of those i love me books

49:38.266 --> 49:39.468
Yeah, well, I've read them all.

49:41.752 --> 49:44.656
Have you ever subscribed to the periodical, The Book Collector?

49:45.458 --> 49:46.159
You know, the book?

49:46.199 --> 49:46.840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

49:46.860 --> 49:47.581
I've got them all, you know.

49:47.601 --> 49:48.342
I've got every one of them.

49:48.362 --> 49:54.673
I had them up to, well, they had a run like from $54 to $67, and then they quit, and then they started up again.

49:54.733 --> 49:55.815
No, I've got them all, man.

49:55.935 --> 49:59.180
They go from $54 right up to $89 right up to now.

49:59.761 --> 50:00.843
I had them up to $67.

50:00.963 --> 50:03.026
Well, that's a pretty good run.

50:03.046 --> 50:05.370
They're selling for $12.56 each now.

50:06.160 --> 50:07.842
And I got all the colophones, too.

50:07.862 --> 50:08.683
You know, there was a colophones.

50:08.703 --> 50:09.444
Oh, I remember those.

50:09.584 --> 50:10.705
I had worked on those.

50:10.725 --> 50:11.466
Those are wonderful.

50:11.486 --> 50:13.889
I had, like, a couple of issues.

50:13.909 --> 50:18.554
Yeah, the topography and illustration work in there.

50:18.594 --> 50:20.396
They started in the 30s, didn't they?

50:20.756 --> 50:22.338
Yeah, Riley was the 30s.

50:22.358 --> 50:24.300
I guess it was in the 50s.

50:24.320 --> 50:27.664
Just about where it ends, you know, the book collected kind of things.

50:27.684 --> 50:32.169
They sort of had, for a dust jacket, sort of a clear tissue.

50:32.390 --> 50:33.851
Yeah, exactly.

50:33.911 --> 50:34.632
That's great.

50:35.050 --> 50:42.602
Well, do you want to call Ray, or are you going to kind of get right back to Rhonda's?

50:44.084 --> 50:48.491
Well, I got to call Ray and Rhonda, then I'll go stay with my father at the motel.

50:48.511 --> 50:49.052
Okay.

50:49.072 --> 50:52.437
Maybe I can call from the Madison's, and then... All right.

50:52.918 --> 50:53.619
Just dump me up.

50:54.761 --> 50:57.806
We'll go by the Madison's before we get to your place.

50:57.826 --> 50:57.926
Okay.

50:57.946 --> 50:58.527
Okay, fine.

51:00.363 --> 51:05.353
I would invite you in the hotel, but there's all kinds of federal people in there.

51:07.737 --> 51:08.458
Yeah, I don't want to go in.

51:08.679 --> 51:11.484
I don't think you and I should be seen together in that place.

51:11.504 --> 51:13.648
You're in bad company.

51:13.668 --> 51:16.694
Well, it's interesting for me because I'm on the prowl.

51:16.734 --> 51:23.367
Well, I would never have seen Kenny Rhodes if I hadn't gone down to breakfast this morning.

51:25.085 --> 51:27.968
And just that one quote from him was worth everything.

51:28.288 --> 51:29.189
I am a bad man.

51:29.209 --> 51:30.250
I am a bad guy.

51:30.571 --> 51:32.092
Yeah.

51:32.112 --> 51:34.495
Let's see what that man did to appreciate it.

51:34.515 --> 51:34.655
Yeah.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.677
Let's see how that house was absolutely great.

51:36.937 --> 51:41.562
Yeah.

51:41.582 --> 51:44.725
It also shows you how insidiously he lied.

51:45.126 --> 51:45.766
Yeah.

51:45.786 --> 51:49.230
On the stand, on their own, doesn't it?

51:49.250 --> 51:50.571
He represents the U.S.

51:50.631 --> 51:51.312
government.

51:52.405 --> 51:53.446
He's there, boy.

51:54.728 --> 52:00.936
He blew me away with one.

52:01.857 --> 52:09.067
Jack's saying about, uh, taking eight truckloads out of there with your permission.

52:09.087 --> 52:10.569
He trusts me so much.

52:10.589 --> 52:13.793
A lot of stuff behind because of what they left in the warehouse.

52:14.094 --> 52:14.714
You mean the feds?

52:14.855 --> 52:17.879
Yeah, and in Minneapolis they left a lot of stuff too.

52:18.079 --> 52:18.279
Oops.

52:20.302 --> 52:21.163
What's stuff?

52:21.818 --> 52:29.446
Uh, some books are mostly stuff.

52:29.466 --> 52:30.347
He just took everything.

52:30.367 --> 52:33.130
He took the tiebacks for the drapes off.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.891
I had sandwich glass tiebacks.

52:34.911 --> 52:37.154
He beat them off with a hammer and broke the thread.

52:37.494 --> 52:39.476
You know what sandwich glass is where it gets its name?

52:39.836 --> 52:40.877
Sandwich Mass.

52:41.118 --> 52:43.060
My family has a house in Sandwich.

52:43.080 --> 52:43.640
Oh.

52:46.283 --> 52:48.045
Right in Cape Cod.

52:48.165 --> 52:48.265
Yeah.

52:50.962 --> 52:53.125
I got a big old Labradory tree left.

52:56.950 --> 53:07.804
My wife says even this weather is too cold for her.

53:07.824 --> 53:09.667
That's almost Smithsonian quality.

53:09.707 --> 53:10.348
Yeah, 78s.

53:10.608 --> 53:12.751
And those are not, that's not bulk.

53:12.771 --> 53:15.695
Those are selected records just like my books were.

53:15.935 --> 53:16.216
Really?

53:16.816 --> 53:19.500
People that are into ethnic music or

53:20.003 --> 53:24.428
American jazz or early labels.

53:24.929 --> 53:26.551
It's superb.

53:26.571 --> 53:31.496
You know, I'm thinking about something that could help the perception of your rehabilitation.

53:31.516 --> 53:32.417
How's that?

53:32.518 --> 53:33.819
I'll leave it on.

53:35.281 --> 53:43.190
At some point, you might want to donate those records, say, to the Smithsonian Institution or someplace.

53:43.270 --> 53:43.590
I don't know.

53:43.610 --> 53:45.032
You wouldn't think of doing that, would you?

53:45.620 --> 53:48.624
Well, if I enjoy them, I listen to them and use them.

53:48.644 --> 53:54.411
Well, at some point in your life, in the future, 20 years from now, 30 years from now.

53:54.431 --> 53:55.372
What's going to happen to them?

53:55.392 --> 53:56.133
I hate to see them.

53:56.974 --> 54:00.939
Do you think they should go to another collector, or do you think they should go to a repository?

54:00.959 --> 54:01.760
Who knows?

54:01.780 --> 54:05.565
Do you think they should remain together as a collection?

54:05.585 --> 54:07.327
Well, I'd have to organize them.

54:07.387 --> 54:09.189
There's very little work done on them.

54:09.670 --> 54:14.496
You know, 78s aren't that old or that much collected yet.

54:15.337 --> 54:20.383
But there's only one book on the recording companies and labels.

54:20.403 --> 54:26.451
It's Brian Russell, American Record Labels.

54:26.871 --> 54:28.373
Some people collect them by the labels.

54:28.393 --> 54:33.119
There were a lot of little studios all over the country, as well as big ones.

54:33.139 --> 54:35.582
And they put out those records.

54:35.602 --> 54:42.791
And sort of the incanabial recorded sound was like before 1908 when they had the single-based records, you know.

54:43.492 --> 54:44.854
They're not as rare as,

54:45.475 --> 54:52.526
in Cannabula would be, but yet, you know, there's a cradle period of recorded sound, too, you know.

54:52.546 --> 55:00.379
The first ones were on the wax cylinders, but then the discs came in not very long afterwards.

55:01.901 --> 55:09.995
And I have a lot of early... You love music, or you love the records?

55:10.015 --> 55:10.075
Oh.

55:10.095 --> 55:12.158
Was it music that attracted you to the records?

55:12.408 --> 55:13.890
by the Wicked?

55:13.910 --> 55:15.652
Well, really both in a way.

55:16.192 --> 55:18.055
Some of the labels are very pictorial.

55:18.435 --> 55:27.325
There's a label called the Lyric label that has a very colorful art of old woman with a white background with cherubs and flowers all around.

55:27.365 --> 55:28.907
Very colorful.

55:28.927 --> 55:38.398
It's a company that's recorded on a Hill and Dale label, or a cut, that type of cut.

55:38.418 --> 55:40.200
And their machine, I only saw one.

55:40.260 --> 55:41.942
I should have bought it.

55:42.462 --> 55:43.844
heard of one other machine.

55:43.864 --> 55:46.868
It was called the Lyraphone.

55:46.888 --> 55:49.251
It was the Lyra record company.

55:49.271 --> 55:56.741
It went out around the time of World War I. But it's a very beautiful label.

55:58.724 --> 56:01.668
Well, that was common among, you know, records.

56:01.688 --> 56:03.811
You collect them as artifacts as much as anyone else.

56:03.831 --> 56:04.712
And I listen to them.

56:04.732 --> 56:05.193
I use them.

56:05.253 --> 56:07.035
I like the music of that period.

56:09.243 --> 56:17.051
You know, I like the Columbia Green, the Green Label Columbia Epic Series, the E-Series, Matrix of Columbias.

56:17.531 --> 56:22.336
You know, all the labels are the same, but yet I'm into that for the music.

56:22.356 --> 56:26.701
There's different fields of collecting, and that's called discography, collecting discs.

56:28.082 --> 56:33.027
Now, ask your father if he doesn't mind talking to me tomorrow.

56:33.087 --> 56:33.287
Sure.

56:33.307 --> 56:37.131
And I don't want him for six hours, an hour, you know, an hour of his time.

56:37.291 --> 56:38.052
Yeah.

56:39.297 --> 56:41.439
I think Ray said he probably could talk with me.

56:41.459 --> 56:44.141
Ray's probably going to be kicked off at 8pm.

56:44.162 --> 56:46.664
Oh, why do you think he'd be kicked off at you?

56:46.684 --> 56:51.608
Well, they're probably shitting pennies right now wondering where you are.

56:51.628 --> 56:52.149
You think so?

56:52.369 --> 56:54.411
What time are you supposed to check in?

56:54.451 --> 56:54.851
10.

56:55.112 --> 56:55.912
Oh, you get till 10pm.

56:55.972 --> 56:58.315
Yeah, I haven't highlighted anything.

56:58.335 --> 56:58.815
Oh, you're fine.

56:58.895 --> 56:59.456
You're fine.

56:59.476 --> 56:59.976
Yeah.

56:59.996 --> 57:01.377
Well, they're probably wondering.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.739
They're not wondering where I am.

57:02.759 --> 57:04.140
They're wondering where you are.

57:04.620 --> 57:06.622
No, I told them I'm out.

57:06.642 --> 57:07.363
You know, I...

57:08.339 --> 57:09.440
Well, you were supposed to be.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.382
Well, hey, I'm a free agent, man.

57:11.663 --> 57:14.145
Well, I don't have to yell a bit.

57:14.165 --> 57:24.677
I mean, hey, I'm over 21, and I'm lucky enough.

57:24.697 --> 57:25.457
Piece of cake.

57:25.477 --> 57:26.038
Don't sweat it.

57:26.939 --> 57:32.625
I don't know how we'll, well, you'll be with us through the trial, how I'll ever see you again.

57:32.892 --> 57:33.853
Well, we're going to talk.

57:33.873 --> 57:36.095
You and I are going to talk at breaks during the trial.

57:36.716 --> 57:40.239
Nothing to stop you until you come up and say, hello, Stephen, how are you doing?

57:40.399 --> 57:41.080
Well, yeah, I'll see.

57:41.120 --> 57:43.382
But I mean after this thing is over and that.

57:43.402 --> 57:45.665
Well, I'm going home Saturday morning.

57:46.105 --> 57:46.506
Yeah.

57:46.526 --> 57:52.051
If this thing goes to the jury Friday, you have to free, according to your people, to talk to me.

57:52.151 --> 57:52.612
Yeah.

57:52.632 --> 57:53.272
If you want to.

57:53.573 --> 57:53.753
Yeah.

57:55.154 --> 57:56.916
We'll make fun and see you again.

57:56.936 --> 57:57.617
I wish you will.

57:58.137 --> 57:59.018
I wish you know it's a pleasure being here.

57:59.183 --> 58:00.184
Thank you very much.

58:00.284 --> 58:02.627
I'm looking forward to reading your book.

58:02.647 --> 58:06.332
Well, what do you guys think about after having heard all this for the last seven, eight hours?

58:06.772 --> 58:08.254
It's going to be neat.

58:08.274 --> 58:12.580
What do you think about the questions that I've been asking Stephen and he's given?

58:12.600 --> 58:14.822
Have you been paying attention to what we've been talking about?

58:14.842 --> 58:16.084
Yeah.

58:16.104 --> 58:16.745
I tell it.

58:16.885 --> 58:29.140
What Stephen has done in the last 20 years, to me, he doesn't sound like he's someone who's a kid.

58:29.778 --> 58:32.361
They close the art of reading books.

58:32.381 --> 58:34.584
Right, so that collects them.

58:34.604 --> 58:45.417
It gets the knowledge and then it reads from something, from one thing, and then right away knows that he's read something from another book that has kind of linked that together.

58:46.278 --> 58:52.386
Yeah, how he kicked out all these weird books.

58:52.406 --> 58:53.507
To me, I'd say,

58:53.943 --> 59:01.890
would take them... Steven said, you know, that would have been a machine, right?

59:01.990 --> 59:04.593
You know, he just came like a thief.

59:04.753 --> 59:09.117
Usually a thief would steal to make profit and make money.

59:09.337 --> 59:11.759
Well, I had a question I've got to ask.

59:11.779 --> 59:14.642
Excuse me, Kevin.

59:16.984 --> 59:21.908
That item that came up in the trial, the shin catalog,

59:23.845 --> 59:24.706
How did you get that?

59:25.527 --> 59:26.829
I never heard of that thing before.

59:26.910 --> 59:27.731
I mean, I know the case.

59:27.751 --> 59:28.712
Oh, I've read of it.

59:30.515 --> 59:33.920
Was that something that came along, came around?

59:34.040 --> 59:40.550
I had a real good collection of just clippings, and I followed that tin case very closely.

59:40.610 --> 59:47.259
I even went as far as to go to Oberlin College to their college newspaper and go through his arrest.

59:47.660 --> 59:51.085
And even Bill Moffat's house, I looked up.

59:51.554 --> 01:00:18.861
you know i was sort of fanatic to i just wanted to see where moffett lived and he lived in a brick victorian house on a on a northeast corner i wanted to see what the guy who undid chin lived like and that i think i would like him he had a sort of a bitcoin moffett he's going to be here yeah yeah i think i'm i'm looking forward to meeting him he's a lover of

01:00:19.297 --> 01:00:20.919
Well, you must have met him.

01:00:20.939 --> 01:00:23.622
What kind of a... He wasn't, he hadn't taken over there yet.

01:00:24.403 --> 01:00:26.646
I was out there in August, and Moppet hadn't taken over.

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:28.469
Oh, you haven't been to Oberlin and met him, huh?

01:00:28.489 --> 01:00:29.850
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant to Huntington.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:30.631
He's now at the Huntington.

01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:33.755
Yeah, I know he's at the Huntington, but... I haven't been to Oberlin, no.

01:00:33.775 --> 01:00:34.897
Oh, so you've never met him, huh?

01:00:34.957 --> 01:00:35.397
No, I haven't.

01:00:35.478 --> 01:00:38.742
Oh, no, this will be a little for me.

01:00:38.762 --> 01:00:41.986
But, I mean, were you comparing yourself to Shin?

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:47.633
Or were you just kind of interested in... I was just fascinated by the... It's sort of like...

01:00:50.127 --> 01:00:55.415
a moth being drawn to flame, I was sort of fascinated by Shin's undoing.

01:00:56.556 --> 01:01:03.066
But now Shin was a... I thought he was... He violated the books.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.368
He sold them, you know?

01:01:04.388 --> 01:01:05.249
Yeah, he was innocent.

01:01:05.369 --> 01:01:07.793
But... Yeah.

01:01:07.813 --> 01:01:13.601
But were you amused that he was regarded as the greatest at that point?

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:15.183
Yeah.

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:19.189
And did you feel that perhaps you were superior to him?

01:01:19.658 --> 01:01:21.922
in terms of accomplishment?

01:01:21.942 --> 01:01:28.171
Well, I wanted to see what, you know, I've got a little piece of inside information on that shin case that nobody else knows.

01:01:29.573 --> 01:01:31.196
I met a mafia guy.

01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:35.903
He's in the book called, there's a book I have about the mafia.

01:01:35.923 --> 01:01:39.349
But this guy was the biggest loan shark in Cleveland.

01:01:39.409 --> 01:01:41.592
He was affiliated with Presser and these guys.

01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:46.780
His name is Martin DeFabio.

01:01:46.928 --> 01:01:47.829
DeFabio.

01:01:47.849 --> 01:01:48.690
DeFabio.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.031
And he's a... E-F-A-B-I-O.

01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:52.834
Yeah, he's a renowned... Mafiosa.

01:01:52.854 --> 01:01:54.636
Yeah, he was a loan shark.

01:01:54.656 --> 01:01:58.780
I met him in Springfield, Missouri, and, of course, when you get into... That's a prison.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.663
When you get into prison, everybody knows your rap.

01:02:02.123 --> 01:02:09.631
Well, I got to talking with DeFabio, and he said... Now, this is when you were up for your evaluation.

01:02:09.651 --> 01:02:11.152
Yeah, in the federal penitentiary.

01:02:11.192 --> 01:02:15.957
He was in... He's a guy in his 70s, and he was in for some sort of...

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:20.642
And he said, why the hell did you get those books?

01:02:20.682 --> 01:02:24.141
He says, they aren't worth a damn.
