WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:04.612
Okay, the machine is on.

00:04.632 --> 00:07.658
What are you going to eat?

00:07.718 --> 00:10.643
What are you going to eat?

00:10.663 --> 00:15.352
I'm going out tonight, so I'm just going to have a beer or something like that.

00:15.372 --> 00:20.101
I like the idea that this is a... I'm going to start with an artifact.

00:20.121 --> 00:20.642
Okay.

00:20.662 --> 00:22.405
Yeah, I want to start with a book.

00:22.425 --> 00:24.068
We're really obviously going to focus on the booklet.

00:24.889 --> 00:26.292
That, in your preface...

00:26.677 --> 00:29.641
You see this as a biography, as an autobiography.

00:29.962 --> 00:31.804
It's a casual remark.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.827
It wasn't the main point, I think.

00:33.847 --> 00:36.531
It was the one suggestion.

00:36.751 --> 00:39.215
But it does form an autobiography.

00:39.335 --> 00:41.558
Pick up a little bit of that.

00:41.679 --> 00:42.540
In what respect?

00:43.561 --> 00:45.724
Would you think of writing?

00:46.706 --> 00:48.268
I keep journals.

00:48.588 --> 00:53.215
I don't think I could ever write a film autobiography.

00:53.235 --> 00:54.557
It's too large a job.

00:55.837 --> 01:07.910
I've got enough trouble keeping up with the poetry writing and the music and the photography and the journals and the interviews and essays.

01:09.111 --> 01:14.217
And I'm way years behind in editing all that, so to take on another project and put my back.

01:16.379 --> 01:25.489
But the poetry does serve... Okay, the poetry serves as an autobiography of moments when I wake up in the middle of my life and look around

01:26.093 --> 01:31.462
inside or outside, and notate that efficiently.

01:32.543 --> 01:37.812
But it doesn't cover the drama or exciting moments particularly.

01:38.012 --> 01:42.820
It just covers those moments when I wake up and look.

01:43.205 --> 01:51.196
I read that really fine piece in the Paris Review interview 20 years ago.

01:51.216 --> 01:52.277
I like that.

01:52.297 --> 01:52.858
It's nice.

01:53.639 --> 01:55.121
I re-read it again last night.

01:55.642 --> 01:59.647
It was probably one of the best interviews I ever did.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.409
And that was almost untouched.

02:02.491 --> 02:05.475
I noticed that that was basically unedited.

02:05.575 --> 02:08.098
He said that he did it

02:08.416 --> 02:12.141
That's very unusual for those interviews.

02:12.161 --> 02:18.289
Quote, the spirit of the universe was what I was born to realize.

02:18.409 --> 02:29.424
I don't know what I meant then, but the spirit I would define as breath, from Latin spiritus, breathing.

02:30.586 --> 02:36.634
And basically I think of poetry as unobstructed breath.

02:36.918 --> 02:44.748
that is complete breath, vocalization of the whole body and mind and speech together.

02:47.732 --> 03:01.710
And now, by hindsight, long hindsight, say six years afterward, I began getting involved with meditation practice, and meditation is also on the breath.

03:02.652 --> 03:10.623
Using the breath as a vehicle for waking up and becoming conscious of what's going on unconsciously or what's going on automatically.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.468
If you're breathing all the time but you don't notice it.

03:14.488 --> 03:17.413
So you're seeing things all the time so you don't notice it.

03:18.634 --> 03:24.022
So with poetry or with meditation you begin noticing what you notice.

03:24.042 --> 03:27.867
So in that sense realizing the spirit of the universe beginning with the breath.

03:28.538 --> 03:33.323
Let's start where you thought we might want to start, the artifact, because I would like to get that done.

03:34.024 --> 03:34.664
Yeah.

03:34.845 --> 03:51.042
I figured it was my one and only chance to put my hand on, in the construction of an artifact, a book of complete collected poems from early to present.

03:52.503 --> 03:54.085
Well, fellas, I had noticed it.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.128
Okay, well, I...

03:57.445 --> 04:05.693
What an only chance to make a book of all my work, poetry, as I would idealize it.

04:05.713 --> 04:13.741
So the contract I signed gave me right of approval on the artifact itself.

04:13.902 --> 04:22.610
So I had a complete cloth binding, acid-free paper, sewn binding, a cloth cover, sewn binding.

04:23.111 --> 04:26.254
And then I didn't like the cover they did.

04:27.095 --> 04:41.670
So I commissioned an artist, Harry Smith, to determine the optics of the cover, bright, imperial red.

04:41.690 --> 04:46.815
Is there symbolism in all this for you, or is it just something else?

04:46.835 --> 04:53.862
Actually, those are classic Chinese Buddhist colors.

04:54.196 --> 05:04.048
a Buddhist insignia that I'd seen in Bodhgaya originally, which would be stamped on all the books, on all six volumes, so a uniform edition.

05:04.068 --> 05:09.896
So I had to think in town for the uniform edition for Long Rain and the elegance possible.

05:10.276 --> 05:20.389
And then for models, Harry Smith, the painter, filmmaker, and a great man, actually, was mentioned in some of the poems.

05:21.685 --> 05:33.625
suggested the Oxford Greek-English lexicon for tight space, and the Yeats very arm edition of plays McMillan for the design of the cover.

05:33.645 --> 05:37.011
What did this tell you?

05:37.565 --> 05:39.849
About you, about your place.

05:39.870 --> 05:43.737
I mean, this is indicative of something, isn't it, I think?

05:43.897 --> 05:44.639
About your poetry?

05:44.919 --> 05:49.969
Well, I held out a long time and stayed with City Lights, which had elegant little books.

05:49.989 --> 05:53.296
I thought they were nicely designed.

05:53.416 --> 05:56.923
I mean, what I'm saying is maybe the literary establishment is...

05:56.903 --> 06:00.929
as hostile now as it perhaps might... No, that's not the case.

06:00.949 --> 06:01.770
So not altogether.

06:02.531 --> 06:09.041
There still is the various stereotypes that they haven't overcome.

06:09.161 --> 06:12.647
One is the stereotype of public football.

06:12.687 --> 06:21.460
The other is the stereotype of ageism, like the early poems are great and interesting, but the later poems we don't bother to read or review or notice or mention.

06:21.659 --> 06:23.922
Why is that, do you think?

06:23.962 --> 06:25.364
Lack of attention.

06:25.404 --> 06:26.266
Lack of attentiveness.

06:26.446 --> 06:28.128
You know, just like I'm looking.

06:28.829 --> 06:29.550
Lack of noticing.

06:30.472 --> 06:34.317
You think there's a perception among some that maybe you are of an era?

06:34.878 --> 06:36.280
Stereotype?

06:36.380 --> 06:36.761
Oh, yes.

06:36.781 --> 06:43.250
The other stereotype is, oh, this was great for the 60s, and it's our 50s or 60s or 70s.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.233
Sometimes it's the 40s, sometimes the 50s.

06:45.794 --> 06:48.257
Sometimes the stereotype is of the 60s.

06:48.237 --> 06:50.140
But it varies even.

06:50.380 --> 06:55.166
Even the stereotype doesn't get itself straight.

06:55.767 --> 07:02.597
And a complete ignoring of the entire Buddhist development and the implications of that.

07:02.617 --> 07:11.589
And a lack of exploration of what that is in terms of meditation.

07:11.609 --> 07:13.992
You were quoted in the Paris Review piece

07:14.748 --> 07:21.297
as saying how interested you were in doing an epic poem.

07:21.317 --> 07:25.062
Is this still something that... Not really.

07:25.102 --> 07:29.207
The whole book may be composed of some kind of autobiographical epic.

07:29.748 --> 07:32.151
I'm not talking about this particular book.

07:32.171 --> 07:33.853
I don't think I'd be able to do anything.

07:34.103 --> 07:36.949
Whatever you were talking about 20 years ago.

07:36.969 --> 07:39.074
Well, it was an idea.

07:39.956 --> 07:40.737
It was in my head.

07:40.797 --> 07:41.980
A charming idea.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.568
Yeah, but I don't think I have a Kerouac epic scope.

07:46.490 --> 07:47.792
I think Kerouac had epic scope.

07:47.813 --> 07:49.075
Yeah, but you didn't know that.

07:49.095 --> 07:50.919
It initiated an epic.

07:50.939 --> 07:52.483
It was Zuloa's legend.

07:52.503 --> 07:52.703
Oh, yeah.

07:52.683 --> 07:54.268
He completed it.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.514
How about Kerouac's place now?

07:56.795 --> 08:01.308
Do you think that his stature is eroding, or do you think it's stronger than ever?

08:01.328 --> 08:02.532
Do you think he's important?

08:02.873 --> 08:06.844
I think he's more important than ever now.

08:07.955 --> 08:12.459
Eclat that my book makes is due to Karolaj teaching me how to write poetry.

08:12.479 --> 08:19.025
You said that, and Karolaj really wasn't a poet per se, but then you say, read his long sentences.

08:19.586 --> 08:27.733
Or read his Mexico City Blues, or Scattered Poets, or Heaven, three books, or unpublished poetry, which I've read.

08:27.753 --> 08:29.014
And it's amazing.

08:29.034 --> 08:29.655
It's great.

08:29.675 --> 08:34.039
I think it's the seminal book of poetry of the latter half of the century.

08:34.059 --> 08:35.781
How is this an imitation of Israel?

08:36.081 --> 08:37.422
It's a prose line.

08:37.773 --> 08:39.416
Not just.

08:39.436 --> 08:45.688
I mean, Hal takes off from his prose line, modeled on his prose line, except he wrote longer lines than me.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.354
And maybe more eloquent, I'd say.

08:49.434 --> 08:54.544
What is it that Kerouac had specially that says uniquely, shall we say?

08:54.624 --> 08:56.047
A fantastic ear.

08:57.429 --> 09:00.675
A great ear for sound.

09:00.807 --> 09:08.057
for the vowels and consonants, which you can hear in his recordings.

09:08.117 --> 09:10.680
His pronunciation is exquisite.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.223
And my reading style is taking off from this.

09:14.926 --> 09:26.140
My quote-celebrated, unquote, reading style is really inspired by his precision in pronouncing, appreciating his consonants and savoring his vowels.

09:26.721 --> 09:28.924
Had he not died so tragically,

09:29.107 --> 09:31.009
kind of a force.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.092
I mean, this is a silly question, but he'd still be a fairly young man.

09:34.132 --> 09:37.254
He'd be riding high right now with all these Regans around.

09:37.915 --> 09:44.021
Because he, Carol was middle America, but shrewder than Regan and that thinkery.

09:44.521 --> 09:49.085
And Carolack had real reason to be unafraid of him.

09:49.105 --> 09:53.409
I think so, as he said, here at Harvard, at Lowell House.

09:53.429 --> 09:57.713
But also, the second thing is, Carolack introduced a lot of themes in

09:58.233 --> 10:02.499
popular terminology like Buddhist meditation.

10:02.519 --> 10:19.504
And third, he had a gift of association in the stenographer of his mind that turned on me and Gary Snyder and Michael McClure and any number of poets.

10:19.704 --> 10:26.113
If you ask the young poets, the real people, the people who really are into the mechanics of poetry,

10:26.347 --> 10:32.656
about Caroline, you'll find that her poetry is very highly regarded by poets who are very highly regarded.

10:32.676 --> 10:33.578
Ask Robert Creeley.

10:34.719 --> 10:38.244
Creeley thinks Caroline is a major poet.

10:38.284 --> 10:39.486
Just ask any of them.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.471
Snyder, Creeley, I don't know what poets you like.

10:43.152 --> 10:44.393
It may be different for me.

10:44.574 --> 10:47.278
That was an extraordinary gathering of people, wasn't it?

10:47.298 --> 10:48.059
Yeah.

10:48.079 --> 10:51.484
Well, I mean, so were the Beatles' extraordinary gathering.

10:51.524 --> 10:53.046
Yeah, but that was...

10:53.397 --> 11:03.509
basically one group, but I mean, all this writing talent that seemed to come out at one time, almost like Paris in the 20s.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.751
Yeah.

11:05.991 --> 11:09.375
I mean, was it the type of situation where one would energize the other?

11:09.455 --> 11:10.897
Yeah, we all turned each other on.

11:11.237 --> 11:22.290
I think, again, a major element was Kerouac's sense of sympathy and sympathy tolerance, his tenderheartedness, which is run throughout his writing.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.483
which he had in person.

11:26.985 --> 11:33.974
Despite all the vagaries of being drunk or anything, there was a tremendous vulnerability and softness in him.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.296
Where do you think he was moving with this?

11:35.316 --> 11:36.117
Appreciativeness.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.180
Where was he moving with his writing?

11:38.220 --> 11:39.221
Was he moving?

11:39.241 --> 11:41.804
Well, I don't see his last years as a tragedy.

11:41.824 --> 11:45.049
As Philip Whelan says, the Caroway play was hardly a tragedy.

11:45.069 --> 11:47.572
I mean, he produced an enormous literature.

11:47.592 --> 11:49.915
He turned the literary world over.

11:50.637 --> 12:08.798
inspired any number of young kids and elegant poets, was writing the day he died, produced in his last eight years as much as any novel was produced, you know, Big Sur, Vanity of Dual Arts, Leenda Pick, enormous amount of essays and poetry.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.122
Poetry hasn't even been published.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.849
You know, his work was as voluminous.

12:15.869 --> 12:16.931
I wonder why that is.

12:17.031 --> 12:18.494
Less voluminous than when he was young.

12:18.634 --> 12:26.306
If the poetry is as outstanding as you indicated, I'm sure it is, why hasn't it been published?

12:26.326 --> 12:27.989
Because it is published.

12:28.009 --> 12:29.471
I thought you told me there was a lot of it.

12:29.592 --> 12:33.638
Oh, his widow won't allow anything of this to be published posthumously.

12:34.327 --> 12:38.671
I've talked to her, Stella Karouac says, nothing will be public while I'm alive.

12:38.912 --> 12:39.953
While she's alive.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.194
While she's alive.

12:41.214 --> 12:46.239
And she's sitting on several books.

12:46.259 --> 12:49.002
Some of the Dharma, one book.

12:49.062 --> 12:52.566
Wake Up, A Life of the Buddha.

12:53.246 --> 12:55.569
Scattered Pomes.

12:59.493 --> 13:03.557
Pomes, P-O-M-E-S, all sizes, pomes all sizes.

13:04.432 --> 13:05.253
Except the blues.

13:05.354 --> 13:06.255
It's a formal title.

13:06.335 --> 13:08.078
Pomes all sizes, including the blues.

13:08.098 --> 13:10.142
Is she figuring this out?

13:10.342 --> 13:12.405
She wasn't really married to him that long ago.

13:12.566 --> 13:13.467
Yeah, she was married.

13:13.547 --> 13:15.411
Well, she took care of his mother.

13:16.793 --> 13:16.893
Yeah.

13:16.913 --> 13:20.359
There's some kind of psychic tangle between them.

13:20.379 --> 13:25.748
Like, maybe it's not public written about them, but...

13:26.386 --> 13:28.169
I just won't use it, but it's nice.

13:28.189 --> 13:39.847
As an alcoholic, very often you lay your anger on the people that you're closest to and most dependent on, you know, guilt or shame or irritability or irrationality.

13:40.568 --> 13:49.181
And so a month before he died, he wrote to Edie Parker, his first wife, that he wanted to see her, and then wrote her again that he was too sick.

13:49.321 --> 13:53.828
And he wrote to his nephew, Paul, sister's son,

13:54.095 --> 13:58.582
the only surviving camera.

13:58.602 --> 14:00.525
Do you want to leave him?

14:01.907 --> 14:07.295
And I've seen the letter.

14:07.435 --> 14:21.115
Stella got in touch with me after he died and asked if I could connect her with his daughter, Jan, and assured me it was not for any purpose of cutting her out of the will, but just have her sign a paper solution to sell the house.

14:21.871 --> 14:30.961
And then a lawyer went up to her and gave her, which was 18 and it was spaced out, and gave her $500 to sign away any inheritance.

14:30.981 --> 14:33.248
There is even some question about his will.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.334
Is there another will that they suppress?

14:38.898 --> 14:59.488
The legal fact now is that Jan Kerouac, as first blood relation, daughter, established by court, is the legal inheritor of happiness, the state of everything published after 1958, where of everything that copyright of 25 years has expired,

14:59.806 --> 15:10.524
Because no matter what the will, the legal statement is that children, after that 25-year period, the state... How about the unpublished stuff?

15:10.584 --> 15:12.648
That would be the same.

15:13.028 --> 15:14.691
Where is this material physically?

15:14.711 --> 15:16.033
Is that in the hands of a publisher?

15:16.935 --> 15:18.999
It's in a wrong place.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.481
It's in a vulnerable...

15:20.917 --> 15:21.738
Attic.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.022
Oh, Jesus.

15:24.042 --> 15:25.886
And I went up there in 75.

15:25.986 --> 15:31.054
You know, let's just put it someplace where it can be safeguarded, you know?

15:31.075 --> 15:36.584
I went up there in 1975 with Bob Dylan, who... Bob went into Lola?

15:37.345 --> 15:40.290
Yeah, we gave a rolling thunder concert there.

15:41.092 --> 15:42.975
We visited his grave.

15:43.428 --> 15:48.234
And Dillon read some poems over his grave, and we filmed it for a Rinaldo and Clara movie.

15:48.895 --> 15:51.057
And the scene is in the movie.

15:51.378 --> 15:54.221
And going out, I said, what's your interest in Carolach?

15:54.241 --> 15:59.207
He said, oh, Carolach turned me on to poetry.

15:59.267 --> 16:07.697
When I was in 1959, someone handed me a copy of Mexico City Blues, and it blew my mind, and introduced me to poetry that had talked to me.

16:07.795 --> 16:15.785
I mean, even Dillon was influenced by Carolus, as well as Creeley, Snyder, McClure, Waylon, myself, even Burroughs.

16:15.805 --> 16:23.095
This is the type of thing that will become more apparent 20 years, 40 years from now, I think.

16:23.996 --> 16:25.918
But it's definitely visible.

16:26.058 --> 16:32.687
The reason, however, and I'm going back, why is Carolus not known as a poet?

16:32.707 --> 16:34.429
Or not appreciated as known.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.672
I'm saying he's known...

16:37.124 --> 16:44.093
It's pretty nearly universally by generations of poets of the Black Mountain, San Francisco, and New York schools.

16:44.113 --> 16:45.975
They all know it.

16:45.995 --> 16:47.417
You just ask anybody that goes to the St.

16:47.437 --> 16:53.946
Mark's Poetry Project in New York or hangs around San Francisco poetry scene, or any of the elders and youngers.

16:54.527 --> 16:56.449
It's universally appreciated by the poets.

16:56.851 --> 17:01.398
Not at all in any anthology, not at all taught in school, except where we teach.

17:01.418 --> 17:03.923
He really teaches Caroway.

17:03.943 --> 17:22.453
The reason, I think, was Caroway was so abused by the critics during his life, and put down, and especially put down by his so-called proponent, Kenneth Raskin, that when the book Mexico City Blues came out, the major review in the New York Times by Rex Ross,

17:22.518 --> 17:30.376
He denounced the book, said it was separating the men from the boys in Carpenter, the stupid kids that didn't have any discipline, didn't know how to write.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.002
He was sorry he'd never prayed and catwagged at all.

17:33.623 --> 17:35.768
It was the most vicious review of the message.

17:36.558 --> 17:45.732
Because Kenneth Rexroth thought that Jack Howard had been fucking his wife Martha with Robert Creeley when Martha was trying to run away from him.

17:45.752 --> 17:46.853
It comes down to that.

17:46.873 --> 17:47.715
It came down to that.

17:47.735 --> 17:48.976
It came down to that.

17:49.657 --> 17:55.106
You know, you hear these stories so often about why a certain person gets assigned a book.

17:55.126 --> 17:59.552
You're doing something very petty and very simple.

17:59.873 --> 18:01.435
Rexroth was supposed to be...

18:01.651 --> 18:29.413
You know, Mr. Duton was the protector of the San Francisco scene, and he had pushed Caroline 5 with Malcolm Kelly, and then there was this problem with his wife, in which Rexroth almost committed suicide, on the floor chewing the rug, and the cerebral weeping, and his wife had to go back to him completely, and Rexroth had the hallucination that we were all having orgies with his wife in my cottage.

18:29.849 --> 18:31.513
and wouldn't talk to me for a couple of years.

18:31.994 --> 18:33.557
And it was just out of his head.

18:35.021 --> 18:37.366
I did an interview with Robert Giroux a couple of years back.

18:37.727 --> 18:39.771
His Shakespeare book came out.

18:39.791 --> 18:42.698
And, you know, inevitably you ask about Kerouac.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.067
He told the story of how he lost on the road.

18:47.789 --> 18:49.613
And Kerouac came in with this

18:50.318 --> 18:52.482
It was all rolled up.

18:52.703 --> 18:54.747
He just threw it out.

18:55.448 --> 18:55.889
Here it is.

18:56.711 --> 18:57.893
He lost.

18:57.913 --> 19:00.378
No, he didn't lose it, but he said, well... He didn't read it.

19:00.659 --> 19:01.821
Yeah, well, what's happened?

19:01.841 --> 19:05.409
He said, geez, why did you do it like that for?

19:05.429 --> 19:07.112
I mean, how are we going to edit it?

19:07.244 --> 19:08.405
He said, edit it?

19:08.866 --> 19:13.872
He said, this was inspired by the Holy Spirit, according to Giroud.

19:13.912 --> 19:15.734
Yes, and it was.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.456
Giroud didn't believe in the Holy Spirit enough.

19:17.616 --> 19:19.999
So Giroud said, I really made a mistake.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.821
I shouldn't have said that.

19:22.121 --> 19:22.942
Well, you should have read it.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.584
He led to Melvis Cowley with it.

19:24.604 --> 19:25.926
He hadn't even read it.

19:25.986 --> 19:31.412
I have with me a caroac.

19:31.696 --> 19:33.579
correspondence to Milton Kelly.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.583
I'm just reading all that over.

19:36.725 --> 19:38.969
But they did finally edit it, I think.

19:39.089 --> 19:41.353
Much less than people think.

19:41.573 --> 19:42.575
Much less to see that, right?

19:42.775 --> 19:43.296
Yeah.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.141
I kept writing to Kelly that he was editing it for him, blah, blah, blah.

19:46.161 --> 19:48.325
He was just delaying it to make him think he was editing.

19:48.385 --> 19:50.529
And he made some such or so to be more readable.

19:50.709 --> 19:51.831
So really it's...

19:51.811 --> 19:56.761
It's not the same manuscript because it was divided into paragraphs.

19:56.781 --> 20:01.431
Look at that kind of creative editing for an editor, the Max Perkins type of school.

20:01.451 --> 20:09.347
It might have been good for Wolf, but Kerouac was more of a literary man than any of his editors and a better writer than any of his editors, and he really knew what he was doing.

20:09.479 --> 20:15.589
It wasn't until he got into Don Allen's hands that the editor respected him and published Subterraneans.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.633
Subterraneans is... How does that stuff stand up?

20:19.214 --> 20:20.276
Great.

20:20.757 --> 20:26.245
All the Parallax books are now in print and read widely, which was not so in his lifetime.

20:26.866 --> 20:31.093
See, as time goes on, more and more people are able to read it.

20:31.153 --> 20:33.136
Faulkner was out of print in his lifetime.

20:33.457 --> 20:34.759
Yeah.

20:34.779 --> 20:35.520
A lot of people.

20:35.753 --> 20:41.776
John Wieners, who I think is the greatest poet in New England, has been in and out of mental hospitals.

20:41.836 --> 20:43.603
There's not one single book of his imprint.

20:44.275 --> 20:48.541
and Black Sparrow Press is now preparing a collective wiener.

20:48.641 --> 20:49.642
Do you know wiener, sir?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.885
I'm sorry, I don't know his work.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.748
You still give Donnell an anthology.

20:53.968 --> 20:56.792
No, the name is wiener.

20:56.892 --> 20:59.355
I'm weak in forgery, confess.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.918
Well, that's my specialty.

21:00.938 --> 21:02.980
I don't expect other people to be so eager.

21:03.181 --> 21:04.462
Well, it's a failing.

21:04.583 --> 21:07.887
I was just down in New York for the National Book Critic Circle thing.

21:08.187 --> 21:10.069
Sharon Oldswood won the award.

21:10.089 --> 21:11.050
I didn't vote.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.431
Is that 1984?

21:12.451 --> 21:12.952
Yeah.

21:12.972 --> 21:13.772
Is my vote?

21:13.793 --> 21:14.793
84 or 85.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.056
Yeah, yours is this year.

21:18.557 --> 21:19.999
Now, there might be one problem with this.

21:20.139 --> 21:26.225
I don't know what the rule is, but I think it has to be material that is largely written that year, so there may be a problem.

21:26.965 --> 21:29.388
Don't let me judge on that, but it doesn't matter.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.091
I think the book is really quite an achievement.

21:32.211 --> 21:34.633
A little get on the zone, get around the zone of pride.

21:35.052 --> 21:43.405
I noticed also in the prefatory remarks that you mentioned that you did go back and change a few things that have been bugging you always.

21:43.885 --> 21:49.133
So that would make these earlier things rather important variant readings, wouldn't it, to collect these?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.998
What types of things did you go in and change?

21:52.018 --> 21:54.882
I think I mentioned a few words in Sunflower Sutra.

21:54.902 --> 21:56.544
At the last line, you repeated the words.

21:56.785 --> 21:58.828
Nuts and bolts type things, right?

21:58.868 --> 22:01.532
Nothing in terms of... No, no changes in them.

22:01.732 --> 22:03.174
philosophy.

22:03.836 --> 22:14.553
Just the phrasing that was irritatingly awkward or repetitious words that I never noticed until I began checking it out again at the end of Sunflower Syndrome.

22:14.573 --> 22:20.263
And I also added in a few phrases to former America so that I wouldn't have to footnote them.

22:20.503 --> 22:23.408
Like, I once saw Israel after playing.

22:23.468 --> 22:27.435
So now it's, I once saw the Yiddish order Israel after playing.

22:27.938 --> 22:34.550
These are really very... These enrich the line and give an indication of what it's about.

22:34.570 --> 22:38.356
You know, just adding more images.

22:38.376 --> 22:43.185
I think for someone who's never... Have you ever run into people now who are reading you for the first time?

22:43.566 --> 22:44.587
Yeah, a lot.

22:44.607 --> 22:48.454
Half of these people say, oh, I just discovered your reality.

22:48.474 --> 22:51.820
Someone gave me reality sandwiches, which is my weakest book, I thought.

22:52.188 --> 22:54.851
And I've carried it around everything.

22:54.871 --> 22:55.893
And I say, did you read Catter?

22:55.913 --> 22:56.714
She says, no, what's that?

22:58.296 --> 22:58.936
So I don't know.

22:59.277 --> 23:12.773
A lot of readers come from having heard or seen my name or heard me sing on the Clash album two years ago, like young kids, 13-year-olds, and then they go check out a book.

23:12.793 --> 23:19.782
Some people from Dilla, years ago, used to pick up on my fortune because Dilla talked about her on the back of one of the record records.

23:20.453 --> 23:22.836
because I was in the Rolling Thunder tomorrow.

23:22.856 --> 23:24.458
Were you in the Rolling Thunder?

23:24.478 --> 23:24.778
Yeah.

23:24.798 --> 23:26.440
Because that was in Worcester.

23:26.460 --> 23:27.942
I saw that thing in Worcester.

23:27.962 --> 23:29.644
Yeah, in Worcester.

23:29.685 --> 23:32.848
I was on stage at the end seeing This Land and Your Land.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.011
Nobody said anything about it.

23:35.031 --> 23:36.473
No, they didn't have to.

23:36.693 --> 23:39.677
I was just along as sort of a mascot, the resident philosopher.

23:39.697 --> 23:40.838
That was a hell of a show.

23:40.858 --> 23:41.760
It was great.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.263
That was something.

23:44.323 --> 23:47.727
I was on that with Peter Olowski and his girlfriend.

23:47.707 --> 23:50.270
for about four months, touring around.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.712
And then I ran into the group.

23:51.732 --> 23:58.559
We're up in Quebec City, and they're up in Quebec City, and Dylan is out in some cars and buggy out there shooting some shots.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.062
Did you ever see the movie?

24:01.122 --> 24:01.503
I didn't.

24:01.723 --> 24:03.785
I got the fourth starring role.

24:07.229 --> 24:08.771
Hello, please.

24:08.791 --> 24:10.333
Hello, please.

24:10.353 --> 24:12.195
Here's Dylan's idea.

24:12.445 --> 24:13.428
Exactly.

24:13.749 --> 24:15.494
Yeah, that would be good.

24:15.514 --> 24:20.168
Dylan's idea was to present me to his audience in the movie.

24:20.188 --> 24:24.902
Actually, literally try and, you know, see what he had to present me as he saw me.

24:25.726 --> 24:30.592
in the movie, and so he gave me a role as father figure, a poet father.

24:31.733 --> 24:33.275
That's kind of touching, isn't it?

24:33.295 --> 24:34.597
Very sweet, made me cry.

24:34.897 --> 24:44.429
But do you find that a lot of these new readers, let's face it, a lot of your poetry was shocking to many people?

24:44.449 --> 24:51.598
I don't think nowadays, to any younger, very little, very shocking now, to any younger kid.

24:51.916 --> 24:55.149
Is that a function of a poet to shop?

24:55.671 --> 24:57.699
Function of a poet?

24:57.719 --> 25:01.032
Is there anything the poet wants to do?

25:01.501 --> 25:04.224
I think there's no defined form.

25:04.244 --> 25:07.967
Well, there's no defined role.

25:08.027 --> 25:10.069
Make a real try, not too oily.

25:10.089 --> 25:11.590
How is this?

25:11.951 --> 25:17.015
Maybe a little too much gravy.

25:17.095 --> 25:18.877
I'm sorry.

25:19.337 --> 25:19.818
I'm really not good.

25:19.938 --> 25:23.661
I don't know the Harvard Square scene that intimately.

25:23.942 --> 25:24.182
All right.

25:24.202 --> 25:26.004
But it was for them walking this time.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.006
I don't have to stop up the gravy.

25:29.026 --> 25:29.567
Oh, yeah.

25:30.047 --> 25:30.748
Thank you.

25:31.015 --> 25:37.388
I choose my function, so to speak.

25:37.408 --> 25:47.969
And what I want to do is extend poetry as far out as you could toward vocalization and toward the bodhisattva communication.

25:49.813 --> 25:50.695
Poetry is a...

25:51.113 --> 25:52.435
I'm sorry, what was that last phrase?

25:52.835 --> 25:54.197
Bodhisattva.

25:54.217 --> 25:55.359
Communication.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.521
It's a Buddhist term.

25:56.801 --> 25:58.664
Could you spell it for me?

25:58.684 --> 26:00.026
V-O-D-H-I-S-A-T-T-V-A.

26:00.086 --> 26:00.346
Thank you.

26:01.327 --> 26:01.728
Bodhi.

26:02.609 --> 26:04.352
Awakened mind.

26:04.412 --> 26:05.634
Essence awakened mind.

26:06.675 --> 26:12.243
Which involves serving others.

26:12.864 --> 26:14.526
Making yourself vulnerable to others.

26:15.688 --> 26:16.649
Relieving others' pain.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.433
By...

26:19.868 --> 26:30.587
He's throwing down your defenses and letting them see what's inside you so they get less paranoid about what's inside them.

26:31.388 --> 26:33.392
So confession is good for the soul, here go.

26:33.813 --> 26:34.975
Not quite so confession.

26:34.995 --> 26:39.363
There's so much confession that requires a sin.

26:39.383 --> 26:41.286
Does it necessarily, I wonder?

26:41.671 --> 26:45.816
In a Catholic context, yeah.

26:46.097 --> 26:49.300
And I'm orthodox, I should know better.

26:49.321 --> 27:02.957
Well, also there's a school of confessional poetry, which is less literary, I mean, it's literary rather than ethical.

27:03.398 --> 27:09.045
You know, I think my poetry is ethical in the sense of...

27:09.110 --> 27:12.574
Like in Whitman, I celebrate myself and sing myself.

27:12.774 --> 27:14.476
And what I should assume, you should assume.

27:14.496 --> 27:16.478
For every atom of me is going to belong to you.

27:16.498 --> 27:21.844
For every weirdness of me is the same as your weirdness.

27:22.425 --> 27:27.511
For every raw heart in me is the same as your raw heart.

27:28.152 --> 27:31.656
For every sensitivity in me, you're no less sensitive.

27:31.676 --> 27:33.818
So it's setting an example.

27:34.051 --> 27:37.078
of what Whitman asked for, which was candor.

27:37.219 --> 27:44.617
He used that word over and over again in democratic vistas, prophesying what the poet should be.

27:44.637 --> 27:46.341
And he asked for candor, and I think it's great.

27:46.361 --> 27:51.373
It's a very interesting distinction, candor, as opposed to confession.

27:51.393 --> 27:51.874
Confession.

27:52.462 --> 27:57.995
because confession is very egocentric.

27:58.416 --> 28:06.555
Candor is just ordinary practice that you might have between you and yourself or you and your best friends.

28:06.704 --> 28:10.209
And if you can't talk to your best friends in poetry, then who are you talking to?

28:10.229 --> 28:13.474
Okay, so we're talking poetry as conversation, in other words.

28:13.754 --> 28:14.535
As speech?

28:14.716 --> 28:15.316
As speech.

28:15.437 --> 28:18.922
And it kind of goes back to what you were saying to the Nigerian fellow.

28:18.942 --> 28:19.162
Yeah.

28:19.182 --> 28:31.800
You seem fascinated by this ability of these people to be able to recite songs that they've heard just once.

28:31.780 --> 28:36.526
And then all of a sudden you're asking about the philosophical.

28:37.147 --> 28:41.213
Clearly this is something that you think about.

28:41.233 --> 28:59.998
The notion of flux, related to the notion of the nature of the mind, flux of perceptions and thoughts, thought forms as they say, related to method of composition, first thought, best thought, i.e., primordial thought.

29:00.637 --> 29:17.381
or raw thought, one after another as they come, as a way of composition, which is terawax, spontaneous improvisation.

29:17.401 --> 29:19.644
First thought, best thought.

29:19.704 --> 29:21.006
First thought is best thought.

29:21.707 --> 29:27.555
Meaning, chronologically,

29:27.822 --> 29:45.104
In the sequence of thought forms that arises in your mind during the time of composition, there is a flash of recollection, say, pictorial, generally, of a situation.

29:45.124 --> 29:55.197
Maybe slush on galoshes on Franklin Street.

29:56.172 --> 29:59.996
where the dog barks.

30:00.016 --> 30:04.221
In the telegraph, in the telegraph.

30:04.241 --> 30:07.644
I saw pictures in the telephone poles.

30:07.664 --> 30:14.071
Wires are hung with ice drops.

30:14.091 --> 30:20.678
So then you might say, tough weather in Cambridge.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.862
But that wasn't the first thought.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.684
Tough weather in Cambridge wasn't the first thought.

30:24.704 --> 30:32.814
The first thought was the visual flash of the ice drops and the dog barking wild little slush on Franklin Street.

30:32.834 --> 30:34.476
But what's better then?

30:34.496 --> 30:39.582
Oh, I think the first... But why can't you verbalize that first?

30:39.602 --> 30:40.904
I did, just then.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.866
In tough... What was it in Cambridge?

30:42.906 --> 30:46.150
Oh, because tough weather in Cambridge, because that eliminates all the details.

30:47.492 --> 30:48.673
It eliminates the picture.

30:48.907 --> 30:56.678
And it eliminates your first thought and sublimates it into a generalization.

30:56.698 --> 30:59.581
Is your mind working like this all the time?

30:59.602 --> 31:01.284
Are you thinking politically?

31:02.025 --> 31:04.328
I have often wondered if Shakespeare thought in imagery.

31:04.428 --> 31:08.714
I think he thought the way he wrote.

31:08.854 --> 31:10.136
You do believe this.

31:10.637 --> 31:16.264
That the man would throw 15 metaphors at you in one sentence.

31:16.324 --> 31:16.504
Hello?

31:16.645 --> 31:16.905
Hello?

31:17.645 --> 31:20.069
I don't think it was that.

31:20.089 --> 31:22.132
It's just ordinary mind, I think.

31:23.494 --> 31:24.135
Victorio.

31:27.140 --> 31:35.653
I think Kerouac's point was that when you edit, to simplify it and socialize it and make it sound like...

31:36.562 --> 31:46.376
same as any tough weather in Cambridge or something, you lose the pungency and vividness of the original perception.

31:46.396 --> 31:54.027
So we're trying to define what do I mean by first thought, original perception, or primordial mind.

31:54.047 --> 32:02.940
The sensory flash that you have before you verbalize, and that goes with paroads,

32:03.730 --> 32:10.185
suggestion from writing, quote, don't stop to think of the words, but to see the picture better.

32:10.426 --> 32:13.473
Very brilliant tactical advice for a learner.

32:13.493 --> 32:14.676
Don't stop to think of the words.

32:15.077 --> 32:21.773
You get tangled in, you know, verbal association, your stream of consciousness, rather than the actual

32:22.613 --> 32:28.242
original mind that was vividly impressed.

32:28.262 --> 32:34.051
So go back to the original mind's impression and then verbalize it, get the words come out of it.

32:34.071 --> 32:36.615
If you've got a real picture, then the words are easy.

32:36.635 --> 32:45.308
If you have no picture, then you have to make up something in words that really don't relate, have no reference to your experience.

32:45.328 --> 32:51.017
So when he says don't stop to think of the words to see the picture better, that's the technical

32:51.318 --> 33:02.213
instructions for how do you write spontaneously, which requires a discipline of remembering what you saw or noticing what you noticed.

33:02.233 --> 33:12.347
Noticing what you noticed, rather than passing it over and sort of homogenizing it into something that may echo somebody else's previous poetry.

33:12.783 --> 33:19.294
Now, I read where Harper will be publishing also your journals, your letters.

33:19.674 --> 33:28.108
I just delivered a book of collected prose.

33:28.679 --> 33:29.440
Pardon me?

33:29.480 --> 33:30.862
That shouldn't be fascinating.

33:30.882 --> 33:31.642
I suppose to be.

33:31.662 --> 33:37.349
I'm curious as to why you would want your letters, though, in journals, released, you know, now.

33:38.070 --> 33:40.673
That's a euphemism to say why you're lying.

33:40.693 --> 33:40.913
No.

33:42.014 --> 33:45.038
So I can edit it myself before I take the book out.

33:45.098 --> 33:46.580
Or edit up to this day.

33:47.020 --> 33:53.708
Because I wrote a lot that's not ever been published or went public scattered around.

33:53.688 --> 33:55.930
a lot of places and nobody knows it.

33:55.950 --> 34:07.802
And I've explained myself a million times over and over, or Kerouac, or Gregory Porceau, or Shakespeare, or Blake, or whatever else they say.

34:07.822 --> 34:10.324
But it's not in any form where anybody can get their hands on it.

34:10.344 --> 34:12.526
They can go back to an old issue of Paris Review.

34:12.546 --> 34:13.728
I don't mean the prose so much.

34:13.748 --> 34:21.175
I mean the letters in the journal, which one would think is almost by definition private writing.

34:21.195 --> 34:23.357
No.

34:24.805 --> 34:29.190
No, the prose certainly has its place in print right now, I think.

34:30.151 --> 34:35.656
Journals from 23 years ago are ancient history.

34:35.697 --> 34:41.963
The book being edited now is Journals of 50, being edited by Gordon Ball.

34:41.983 --> 34:49.651
And the typescript is ready now, I have to compare it with the original journal handwriting.

34:49.671 --> 34:53.175
But I published two volumes of journals already.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.830
Indian journals from City Lights.

34:56.870 --> 34:59.814
This is a good book, actually, with photographs.

35:00.655 --> 35:04.420
And then a book called Journals, Early 50s, Early 60s.

35:06.002 --> 35:10.988
This is quite a big departure for you to go Harper and Row.

35:11.089 --> 35:14.073
I had one book by McGraw-Hill, Helen Verbato.

35:14.233 --> 35:21.643
But this is, let's face it, this is a major, and the phrase goes, publishing a magazine, a literary magazine.

35:21.663 --> 35:23.365
Well, I offered it to Framingham.

35:24.037 --> 35:25.799
Well, you didn't have the money.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.723
I'm physically pleased.

35:28.763 --> 35:32.208
It's such a big artifact.

35:32.228 --> 35:33.009
To do it.

35:33.610 --> 35:38.637
I'm trying to answer free paper and to do reproductions and all that.

35:38.657 --> 35:41.481
You must be really quite proud of it.

35:41.941 --> 35:43.884
Do you hold with that argument?

35:43.924 --> 35:44.745
Yeah, I'm very happy.

35:45.603 --> 35:49.682
I mean, it's something I love together.

35:49.963 --> 35:54.685
Then I offered it to Don Allen at Great Fox Press, because that was also alternative publishing.

35:55.070 --> 36:04.222
But he didn't have the facilities, money and distribution.

36:04.782 --> 36:09.228
I did an interview with this Russian novel, Vassily Akshanov.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.311
I know him from Moscow.

36:11.491 --> 36:13.494
Yeah, lovely man.

36:14.695 --> 36:20.863
He told me of a Russian, I don't know if it's a testament either.

36:20.883 --> 36:24.047
Basically it amounts to a Russian writer writing for the draw.

36:24.230 --> 36:29.063
His eyes only for a variety of reasons, obviously.

36:29.805 --> 36:32.352
Metropole is one example of that, I guess.

36:33.656 --> 36:35.661
How old was that?

36:35.681 --> 36:37.125
How old was that, which is what I'm...

36:37.325 --> 36:40.269
Basically, I was going to ask the next question.

36:40.289 --> 36:47.220
Have you ever written for, you know, your eyes only and those of a selected circle of friends?

36:47.240 --> 36:56.213
And tell me about this experience, about writing, not for a general population of readers as such, but for what amounts to yourself.

36:56.233 --> 36:57.855
Well, when I wrote Hell, I didn't have any readers.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.097
I didn't have any books.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.219
I had hardly no home to publish.

37:02.282 --> 37:06.488
I had one, two unpublished books, Gates of Wrath and Empty Mirror,

37:07.295 --> 37:08.437
which are unpublishable.

37:08.457 --> 37:16.491
I wasn't long enough known for anybody to be interested in my juvenilia.

37:16.511 --> 37:18.815
And I decided I was a complete failure as a poet anyway.

37:21.099 --> 37:27.030
Partly because my poetry was too deliberate and too academic.

37:27.050 --> 37:29.033
And I realized that Carol had to write

37:29.435 --> 37:31.160
How old are you?

37:31.180 --> 37:33.004
About me?

37:33.024 --> 37:36.714
Yeah, I haven't talked to you since Kiara.

37:36.734 --> 37:37.075
No.

37:37.235 --> 37:39.782
Formalistic and I wasn't really saying the way I talked.

37:40.437 --> 37:42.899
I wasn't really writing the way I did.

37:43.079 --> 37:47.724
I was more eloquent in bed.

37:47.744 --> 37:53.089
And I was on paper.

37:53.309 --> 38:07.943
And so I wrote one poem that I thought was really an exquisite, elegant poem and real on the basis of a dream of Joan Burroughs, Burroughs' wife.

38:07.963 --> 38:09.364
I saw her in a dream.

38:09.665 --> 38:12.429
And we had this conversation.

38:12.489 --> 38:18.258
She asked me what Bill was doing, how I was knocking and what was Jack doing.

38:18.278 --> 38:27.032
Then, in the middle of the dream, I realized she was dead.

38:27.518 --> 38:30.402
I suddenly got surprised and said, Joan, what kind of knowledge of the dead?

38:30.503 --> 38:32.125
Do you still remember your mortal acquaintances?

38:33.447 --> 38:35.650
She faded in front of me.

38:35.670 --> 38:47.128
In her place I saw a rain-stained tombstone reared in an illegible abodaf under a gnawed branch under a small tree in the wild grass of an unvisited garden in Mexico.

38:47.969 --> 38:51.174
So that was like a funny dream.

38:51.254 --> 38:52.516
I haven't used mine.

38:52.536 --> 38:54.960
Take this.

38:55.278 --> 39:03.891
So I wrote it out, and it's in that book, Dream Record, 1955, which is about the last poem before Howell.

39:03.911 --> 39:05.593
It took me one before Howell.

39:07.336 --> 39:09.099
And I sent it to Rex Rawls.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.901
He said, ah, still academic.

39:10.921 --> 39:12.123
Still a Columbia College boy.

39:12.804 --> 39:13.705
I went to learn a book.

39:13.725 --> 39:14.687
I went to Yale.

39:14.707 --> 39:15.989
Get out of that.

39:16.009 --> 39:18.032
And I thought, well, I can't write it.

39:18.052 --> 39:20.796
The poem's good, but it really is kind of stiff.

39:21.164 --> 39:26.981
I'm in such a great visionary moment, and all I could do was make it a sort of sonnet-like format.

39:27.021 --> 39:30.010
You know, lines all even.

39:31.935 --> 39:33.199
So...

39:33.483 --> 39:34.745
I gave up on writing.

39:34.765 --> 39:37.349
He said, well, I'll write something that won't publish.

39:37.369 --> 39:38.091
I'll just write writing.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.775
I'll just write whatever I feel like, whatever I'm thinking about.

39:41.055 --> 39:42.458
The purpose for what, though?

39:42.478 --> 39:44.441
I mean, better than seeing a shrink?

39:44.521 --> 39:46.685
I mean, therapy, self-therapy, writing.

39:46.705 --> 39:48.948
I was seeing a shrink.

39:49.629 --> 39:51.913
Who was saying, why don't you write what you feel like?

39:53.986 --> 39:55.147
What are you trying to perform to?

39:55.287 --> 39:59.371
I don't know exactly.

39:59.391 --> 40:03.596
I used to read poetry about Tiazoni.

40:03.616 --> 40:07.940
But did you think at the time that what you were doing had literary merit?

40:07.960 --> 40:10.442
No, I thought it wasn't poetry.

40:10.462 --> 40:20.112
And on top of that... Well, I talked about the first part of how it was semi-intact.

40:21.053 --> 40:23.657
in an afternoon.

40:23.677 --> 40:29.905
I revised it a lot later, but the main phrasing and the main structure is the same.

40:30.045 --> 40:32.809
The first line is about the same.

40:32.849 --> 40:39.378
Starving mystical naked instead of starving hysterical naked changes the whole meaning of the ceremony.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.641
Well, I was smarter than that.

40:41.661 --> 40:42.743
I'd be that fundamental.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.968
There's a lot of how it's humorous, actually.

40:47.008 --> 40:48.951
I don't think people understood that.

40:49.184 --> 40:54.211
I think one thing people should appreciate is that you are a very humorous writer.

40:54.371 --> 40:57.896
I mean, there's a lot of, there are a lot of very funny lines.

40:57.936 --> 40:59.038
What does he mean here?

40:59.058 --> 41:05.306
Sort of an extra academic view is that how is a poem a pure anger?

41:05.326 --> 41:08.250
No humor, no perspective about it.

41:08.370 --> 41:10.253
It's total anger.

41:10.273 --> 41:14.018
It isn't starving mystical naked, it's starving hysterical naked.

41:14.038 --> 41:16.862
So there's like a chapter in this sort of...

41:17.213 --> 41:18.076
Goofiness about it.

41:18.337 --> 41:19.622
How did you respond to that?

41:19.862 --> 41:21.107
That was a very interesting note.

41:21.127 --> 41:28.152
In the time interview, he quoted the Time Magazine observation, 58, that you were a rebel without a cause.

41:28.452 --> 41:31.275
Time still has to happen.

41:31.295 --> 41:35.439
The time review of the book is mainstreaming Allen Gisbergs.

41:35.459 --> 41:41.125
One eye on eternity, one on the market stock, market share.

41:41.285 --> 41:42.506
$160,000 contract.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.829
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

41:44.869 --> 41:47.631
How an irrelevant historical odyssey.

41:47.651 --> 41:48.532
Kaddish is the great one.

41:50.454 --> 41:55.219
They just want to be right, even if they have to... Then the worst part...

41:55.688 --> 42:03.896
was to substantiate the view that how was a historical anachronism not of interest.

42:03.936 --> 42:17.389
They quoted one line, Moloch, Moloch, spectral nations, invincible suburbs, demonic industries, invincible manhouses, period.

42:17.409 --> 42:21.713
But the line actually continues, Granite cocks, monstrous bombs.

42:22.587 --> 42:26.097
Monstrous bombs is what gave the line validity all along.

42:26.117 --> 42:34.099
You have a series of semi-hysterical rantings and all of a sudden the reality of demonic industries, monstrous bombs.

42:34.467 --> 42:37.110
that loops the line back into grounding.

42:37.750 --> 42:45.137
They cut out the... They actually have to amputate the line in order to... How could they do that?

42:45.238 --> 42:47.079
It greets me, but they've been doing that all along.

42:48.701 --> 42:56.509
Well, because they wrote in 1960 or something, like, this is the sound of a hysterical woman screaming at the back of a police car.

42:56.589 --> 42:59.251
Wild-eyed poet Allen.

42:59.271 --> 43:03.175
So now they have to keep their record clean.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.824
Well, they're consistent in any case.

43:05.844 --> 43:06.225
Yeah.

43:06.245 --> 43:07.888
Well, that's what I mean.

43:07.908 --> 43:09.791
So they won't have to say, well, they were wrong.

43:10.712 --> 43:18.346
Has this... I guess it can be said that you have achieved a degree of notoriety as a public figure.

43:18.506 --> 43:20.930
That's easy to say.

43:20.950 --> 43:22.473
And that's the Bocatian stereotype.

43:22.493 --> 43:27.762
Talking circumlocutiously here, I guess, but notoriety...

43:28.433 --> 43:37.063
has this affected the public, not the public, but the literary evaluation that you work with?

43:37.083 --> 43:37.323
Oh, yeah.

43:37.423 --> 43:39.646
That's the stereotype of the public buffoon.

43:41.227 --> 43:42.669
No, from notoriety to buffoon.

43:43.250 --> 43:46.774
Rather than from notoriety to skillful means.

43:46.794 --> 43:51.579
I mean, there is a historical function of the poet.

43:51.599 --> 43:51.939
I mean, the role.

43:52.040 --> 43:56.905
The poet is an agitator historically in many...

43:57.492 --> 44:02.116
Oh, it can be public hero in Butler Byron.

44:02.577 --> 44:09.464
It can be public pariah critic in Dante.

44:09.484 --> 44:15.990
Public fraud buffoon goof.

44:16.010 --> 44:23.517
Treat Walt Whitman, who got fired from his job in the customs house for having a dirty book in the drawer.

44:24.560 --> 44:30.418
where Nicole can be seen by his contemporary shallow critics as...

44:30.668 --> 44:59.022
any of those models, or to be appreciated, maybe over-appreciated, like the Laureates, or made into a historic cultural fossil, like Kerouac's critics would make them.

45:01.229 --> 45:16.269
But my own thinking is I know what I'm doing, and I'm doing as best I can as trying to be candid in public and speaking.

45:16.289 --> 45:30.527
As I talk to my friends, my most intelligent friends, talk in public the same way and try to break down the schizophrenic difference between what we say and acknowledge to each other in private

45:30.862 --> 45:32.867
and what can be said and acknowledged in public.

45:34.391 --> 45:36.115
Why should the two be the same, though?

45:36.195 --> 45:43.774
Isn't there a place where things should be said in private as it comes to the same things being said in public?

45:44.159 --> 45:52.747
Things that should be said in private are the things that the cops will get you for.

45:52.767 --> 45:53.508
Like in China.

45:55.009 --> 45:57.311
Or Russia.

45:57.712 --> 46:01.195
You can talk one to one with people and they'll tell you what they really think about it.

46:01.215 --> 46:08.682
I'm wondering if, you know, things that you might say with a lover or a wife or whatever.

46:08.702 --> 46:13.727
You know, you wonder if there are certain things that probably should stay between a couple people.

46:13.960 --> 46:14.881
It's all right.

46:16.284 --> 46:18.087
No objection.

46:18.107 --> 46:22.674
But there are some things that we say in private that would be all right to say in public.

46:23.295 --> 46:29.445
Like women saying, I'm being abused and being used and manipulated by the male chauvinist scene.

46:30.286 --> 46:34.132
Blacks saying I'm being kicked around and rejected.

46:34.873 --> 46:35.935
Gay people saying...

46:36.758 --> 46:37.719
I feel normal.

46:37.839 --> 46:38.240
What is it?

46:38.260 --> 46:39.762
What is all this putting me down for?

46:40.703 --> 46:52.797
NAMBLA, people from the National Man-Boy-Lavestation, people, people... I think they had a press conference in Boston about two years ago.

46:52.937 --> 46:54.099
I'm a member of NAMBLA.

46:54.800 --> 46:57.423
I think that... Oh, absolutely.

46:57.723 --> 46:58.384
Absolutely.

46:58.404 --> 47:02.749
Because they're just talking about what they're thinking and feeling.

47:02.797 --> 47:08.555
And for that speech, they're not an organization to seduce boys, they're an organization to discuss that.

47:09.217 --> 47:12.587
And the FBI is treating them as if they were communist revolutionaries.

47:13.090 --> 47:16.557
And the straight press is using them to try and split the gay movement.

47:16.577 --> 47:20.065
Say, you straight gays should be denouncing these boilers.

47:20.085 --> 47:29.384
It didn't help them to have this kind of ironic kid to come up at the press conference and say, well, I'd have trouble with a two-year-old.

47:29.946 --> 47:33.934
I mean, I'd have trouble, I guess,

47:33.914 --> 47:38.920
A good follow-up would have been, well, how about a three-year-old?

47:39.000 --> 47:42.725
And just keep on going to the point where it's okay.

47:42.765 --> 47:45.408
They're easy to make fun of if you're interested in making fun.

47:45.428 --> 47:47.050
They're easy to persecute if you want to make fun.

47:47.070 --> 47:56.682
I'm a father of young children, so it's a matter that's concerning, to justify it.

47:57.151 --> 47:58.713
Well, I think they're saying something.

47:58.853 --> 48:02.418
But you're saying that they have the right to say, and that's the purpose of their being.

48:02.438 --> 48:03.419
Freedom of speech.

48:03.439 --> 48:04.240
That's what they are.

48:04.961 --> 48:09.646
And they're being persecuted as an organization by the FBI and infiltrated.

48:09.666 --> 48:13.491
And they go around with a man with a spokesman and get them kicked out of their jobs.

48:13.591 --> 48:14.673
Is that right, really?

48:14.693 --> 48:15.193
Oh, yeah.

48:15.253 --> 48:17.336
I didn't really think that it was much of an organization.

48:17.436 --> 48:20.340
It's not.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.863
Well, that's why I joined.

48:22.883 --> 48:23.884
You joined it, really.

48:24.151 --> 48:34.161
Yeah, because I think they were being, a trip was being laid on them as a public whipping boy beyond the needs of... This really opens you up.

48:34.181 --> 48:38.866
I mean, this is almost making you trouble when you do something like that.

48:39.006 --> 48:44.532
I think that compared to the things that have been said about them, they're much more honest.

48:44.552 --> 48:53.061
Particularly Time Magazine saying this is a group of people who exploit people who are weaker and more

48:54.053 --> 48:55.295
defenseless than themselves.

48:55.916 --> 49:00.083
Because it's actually what Time magazine does all the time in the public.

49:00.104 --> 49:10.522
Exploiting and manipulating minds, exploiting and manipulating people that are weaker and more defenseless and weaker, in one other word, inexperienced than themselves.

49:10.862 --> 49:15.370
I think it's exactly the S&M in public that people like Time

49:15.940 --> 49:18.866
and the television media do to people wrong.

49:18.886 --> 49:24.198
I think television violence is ten times worse than anything Namla proposes.

49:24.218 --> 49:28.988
Ten times worse than any television violence actually causes rape, murder,

49:29.272 --> 49:30.213
stealing theft.

49:30.253 --> 49:34.017
Well, I don't want to get into a discussion about NAMBLA.

49:34.037 --> 49:37.141
Well, I wouldn't want to censor television.

49:37.441 --> 49:43.207
But NAMBLA, if you ask them, you check with them what the FBI has done with them in terms of trying to fuck them around.

49:44.508 --> 49:53.338
Besides which, the whole NAMBLA case rose out of this superannuated virgin DA who used to run for

49:53.858 --> 49:57.985
Boston District Attorney, I forgot which, Boyle?

49:58.086 --> 49:59.328
He's not, I think, right?

49:59.709 --> 50:02.413
He used to have a homosexual scandal every time he ran.

50:03.616 --> 50:13.774
And the big, the start of the Nambla scandal was a raid on some so-called boys' houses in Lena Revere, in which he was manipulating that to get votes.

50:14.277 --> 50:18.928
as part of his usual semi-annual anti-gay campaign.

50:18.948 --> 50:22.196
If you look into, I'm just talking about the politics of the Napoli thing.

50:22.216 --> 50:23.820
It makes my blood boil.

50:24.542 --> 50:28.050
But I mean, any organization that comes out like MAMLOF,

50:28.283 --> 50:30.545
It's setting itself up.

50:30.605 --> 50:32.247
For police state attacks.

50:32.267 --> 50:33.388
It's not according to the U.S.

50:33.408 --> 50:34.450
Constitution.

50:34.670 --> 50:34.970
I understand.

50:35.110 --> 50:37.112
That's what I'm talking about.

50:37.132 --> 50:38.314
That's what I'm talking about.

50:38.434 --> 50:45.721
But you're talking about a sitting duck, especially with... Homosexuality used to be a sitting duck.

50:45.761 --> 50:46.342
It's not homosexuality.

50:46.362 --> 50:48.604
Lesbian is not homosexuality.

50:48.624 --> 50:50.106
I don't think.

50:50.126 --> 50:52.609
Well, I should say I like 14-year-old boys.

50:53.229 --> 50:54.831
Three or four or five or six.

50:54.811 --> 50:57.439
I don't think anybody's making up with them.

50:57.459 --> 50:59.605
I don't get that type of philosophy.

50:59.625 --> 51:01.130
That's why I said this morning.

51:01.150 --> 51:07.268
A kid got up there and he said, well, I'd have trouble with a two-year... Of course, that was the clip that went on the news.

51:07.417 --> 51:10.601
I'm sure I selected that.

51:10.901 --> 51:31.264
That still sounds like the press exploiting and manipulating vulnerable people, rather than presenting the actual coherent statement in that book.

51:31.615 --> 51:35.903
That sounds like the press on its S&M game.

51:35.923 --> 51:38.749
I mean, it's a two-edged sword.

51:38.769 --> 51:41.995
When you start, you know, trying to prevent people from talking.

51:43.478 --> 51:46.684
Anyway, I don't remember them now, but... You know what?

51:46.704 --> 51:48.187
I got lots of stuff.

51:48.387 --> 51:50.451
Okay, I got time.

51:51.140 --> 51:52.562
It began with Byrne.

51:52.683 --> 52:01.338
In fact, I got up on television and defended Nambl at one time and said, well, I remember I was some guy in Revere Beach when I was there the summer of one year.

52:02.860 --> 52:06.807
Took out his member and tried to get me to take out mine.

52:06.827 --> 52:07.849
It didn't bother me.

52:08.167 --> 52:17.137
Oh, God, there was a barrage of phone calls saying, how dare you put this person on the air and say what he thinks.

52:17.317 --> 52:23.503
I would say there's a distinction between... I'm fascinated to have this.

52:23.523 --> 52:29.950
It's not going to get into my... I don't mind.

52:29.970 --> 52:31.212
Thank you very much.

52:31.812 --> 52:37.178
I believe, depending the weak and the innocent, and in this case, I think it's the weak and the innocent being manipulated by...

52:37.546 --> 52:44.839
the politicians and the press, for the worst of reasons, for commerce and for vote power.

52:44.859 --> 52:56.019
And I don't think, I don't think the politicians and the press are either reporting accurately what NAMBLA is, you know, reporting what the whole NAMBLA is.

52:56.039 --> 52:59.385
I got a feeling that you are as supportive of them as...

52:59.720 --> 53:04.204
It's strictly one of their constitutional right to free speech.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.506
I mean, I'm on the right track here.

53:06.566 --> 53:09.829
I also feel sympathetic to man-boy love.

53:09.890 --> 53:10.951
Say 13, 14, 15.

53:11.011 --> 53:16.195
Remember, Czechoslovakia, the age of consent is 15.

53:18.277 --> 53:21.300
Central Europe, the age of consent between boys and men is 15.

53:22.061 --> 53:23.302
Old Greek practice.

53:23.322 --> 53:27.186
Remember, the parents used to get the teacher when the kid was in adolescence is 15.

53:27.786 --> 53:29.608
That's nothing new in human history.

53:29.977 --> 53:32.361
But to be able to talk about it, even?

53:32.481 --> 53:33.643
But to talk about it, clearly.

53:34.023 --> 53:35.165
Well, what about doing it?

53:35.185 --> 53:37.569
But talking about it to be persecuted by the FBI?

53:37.749 --> 53:37.949
No.

53:38.891 --> 53:40.273
That's going too far.

53:40.453 --> 53:41.475
What would be the purpose?

53:41.495 --> 53:43.878
I mean, is that the purpose of the organization, to talk about it?

53:44.219 --> 53:44.639
Yeah.

53:44.699 --> 53:47.143
Why do you need a national organization to talk about it?

53:47.784 --> 53:56.237
Because Byrne was busting that free house where there were relations between young boys, but not Daniel.

53:56.487 --> 54:04.460
I think there was one case of a nine-year-old kid who was the youngest, and that was sort of like ambiguous whether anything happened really, but that wasn't the whole scene there.

54:04.480 --> 54:10.049
The main scene was runaway boys being taken care of by older men, developing an interesting relationship.

54:10.069 --> 54:21.027
The police grabbing the kids, beating them up, and forcing them to rat on the older guys against the will of the kids, and traumatizing the kids and abusing the kids a lot more than the older men did.

54:21.530 --> 54:25.434
Because the older men actually had a relationship and the police were just using the kids.

54:25.454 --> 54:27.496
And then Vern was using them.

54:27.516 --> 54:28.978
This is a long story.

54:28.998 --> 54:34.444
And it would be almost impossible to... Because I don't remember it all now.

54:34.464 --> 54:45.195
But I have all the old enamel bulletins with all the actually descriptive accounts of police coercing and intimidating the kids and the kids... Well, allegations.

54:45.555 --> 54:45.875
Yeah.

54:45.895 --> 54:49.840
And then the kids on the stands complaining about how the police had treated them.

54:49.860 --> 54:50.220
Yeah.

54:51.044 --> 54:53.049
And that wasn't reported in the paper.

54:53.069 --> 54:53.731
None of that was.

54:53.751 --> 54:54.212
Let's face it.

54:54.252 --> 54:56.297
The cops think this is a very good bus, right?

54:56.638 --> 54:56.919
Right.

54:57.440 --> 55:04.558
The cops think this is a fine bus while the Narcotics Bureau is working with Cosa Nostra penalty penalty.

55:04.578 --> 55:06.323
Can you have a couple of months?

55:06.343 --> 55:07.686
No, I have it at home.

55:07.666 --> 55:13.134
I was supposed to pick up some cash from there.

55:13.715 --> 55:27.256
In other words, if you delve deeply, a little more deeply under the surface of the news stories and the cop stories, it's like, remember that old scandal from Boise?

55:27.637 --> 55:28.378
The boys from Boise?

55:29.500 --> 55:31.763
Oh, that was in the 50s or 60s.

55:31.783 --> 55:34.888
There was this whole town that went on an anti-gay campaign.

55:35.408 --> 55:39.523
on the similar basis than it all turned out to be.

55:39.543 --> 55:47.832
The cop was stealing money and was trying to cover on himself by creating a scandal and a big political... Well, it was a big case out there.

55:48.284 --> 55:50.147
I don't know where, but out in the Midwest someplace.

55:50.387 --> 55:53.111
Everyone was accusing everyone else of child molestation.

55:53.131 --> 55:53.732
You see that case?

55:54.012 --> 55:54.813
Yeah, they're not staying.

55:54.833 --> 55:55.534
It turned out not.

55:56.015 --> 56:00.922
It turned out that somebody inside was on a camera.

56:00.942 --> 56:06.911
I doubt very much that Nambla represents anybody who's making out for those kids under 10 or 12.

56:07.892 --> 56:11.878
I bet it's just pubescent kids and somebody might argue against it.

56:12.230 --> 56:15.936
and somebody might argue for it, but it's something that you could talk about.

56:15.956 --> 56:25.652
Maybe you can't talk about it, but something that people talk about in private and discuss in private more sanely than they do in public.

56:25.672 --> 56:26.453
Or with more humor.

56:29.718 --> 56:35.828
But the question came down to why talk in public the way you talk in private?

56:37.251 --> 56:37.972
Have you been in Russia?

56:37.992 --> 56:39.334
You know why.

56:39.803 --> 56:45.351
If you've been in China, you know why, or in any communist country.

56:45.371 --> 57:08.084
We were around in the 50s, in literary circles, and observed the fact that Henry Miller was illegal, like grass or something, or Nambla, that Burroughs was illegal, that John Cheney was illegal, that Lord Rochester was illegal, that translations of Catullus were illegal, and the classic stuff was illegal, that Shakespeare was one time Bolgara, the Bible was Bolgara.

57:08.104 --> 57:09.186
Thomas Bolgara.

57:09.537 --> 57:37.080
you'll realize that politicians can get away with double talking because the literature is also restricted to euphemism and if you can extend the range of literature to include the speech of ordinary men like Worthworth said it will ultimately affect political speech in

57:37.381 --> 57:40.446
coerce more candor and frankness in political speech.

57:43.231 --> 58:00.018
And Regan's acting and faking and television triumph is part of a wave of trying to roll back on censorship that the moral minority is putting through.

58:00.038 --> 58:02.342
It's part of the same mentality, I think.

58:02.542 --> 58:05.986
Would you like me to send you a copy of this?

58:06.267 --> 58:07.749
Oh, yeah.

58:07.769 --> 58:08.389
I'm going to run.

58:08.590 --> 58:10.112
I'm going to go out, if you don't mind.

58:10.812 --> 58:24.870
The press, the media, Reagan and the media going along with it, they're doing it to Nicaragua as rape and illegal terrorism and the cultivation of international terrorism.

58:25.154 --> 58:41.760
While hypocritically they're announcing, I remember the CIA said after it was discredited in the late 60s and early 70s, the CIA said the main international problem we have to concern ourselves with is international terrorism.

58:41.781 --> 58:45.927
And now it is precisely the CIA that's practicing international terrorism.

58:45.967 --> 58:49.272
They're talking out of the side of their mouth one way and acting another.

58:49.393 --> 58:51.516
And they've got a courier mandate to continue it.

58:52.458 --> 58:55.481
Well, they don't have a public mandate to continue the war on the ground.

58:55.622 --> 58:58.064
Yeah, but it's public apathy.

58:58.084 --> 59:14.182
I haven't really seen a... They don't have a legal mandate, either in international law... Well, that's the point I'm making, that the government is acting illegally and encouraging terrorism, practicing terrorism, and hypocritically denouncing terrorism.

59:14.963 --> 59:18.567
And until people print that in the newspaper, just in those words...

59:18.665 --> 59:39.913
It's never going to be got across to the public, and the public will be apathetic, because the press is treating it, you know, well, Reagan's got a mandate, so anything he does is allowable, because the world is the world, and that's real politics, and I would want to be a sore thumb and start talking straight turkey in the newspaper, because my face will stick out, and I'll be considered a flake.

59:40.737 --> 59:42.178
It's the same thing as 1950.

59:42.399 --> 59:55.973
My face will stick out, and I'll be considered a plague, and I'll get a mark on my record, and I will get a good job as the PR agent for McDonnell Douglas or whoever.

59:56.013 --> 59:58.715
That's a tough one to get into, I'm sure.

59:58.735 --> 59:59.516
Honeywell.

59:59.536 --> 01:00:00.798
Honeywell.

01:00:00.878 --> 01:00:01.739
Local.

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.320
Data General.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.201
Digital.

01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:04.642
Wang.

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:07.945
Wang is a mole.

01:00:07.985 --> 01:00:09.006
Did you know that?

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:11.256
Oh, but he loses.

01:00:11.276 --> 01:00:13.240
The guy has made the city wealthy.

01:00:13.981 --> 01:00:14.562
Is he Chinese?

01:00:15.023 --> 01:00:15.825
He's Chinese.

01:00:16.306 --> 01:00:20.574
I don't know if he's from mainland China or away, but he's been here about 30 years.

01:00:21.797 --> 01:00:26.405
And 20 years ago, he just had a little place, a little lab out on $495.

01:00:26.426 --> 01:00:31.315
And now the guy, his net worth is $1.6 billion.

01:00:31.615 --> 01:00:35.359
one of the three or four richest men who were powered in the country.

01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:44.407
And I mean, this guy is now, all of a sudden, Lowell used to be Greeks, French, Irish, everybody genuflexed in this way.

01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:46.990
You know what?

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:47.851
I hate that run.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.313
I'm taking a look.

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:53.336
From Silk, the wagon part.

01:00:54.177 --> 01:00:56.359
Lowell, Silk City.

01:00:56.379 --> 01:00:57.460
Wasn't it actually?

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.504
Patterson was Silk City.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:11.608
No, Lowell was the city that was created to learn all those looms and textile looms.

01:01:11.628 --> 01:01:14.310
Other canals or more canals there than anywhere else.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:18.454
I had a meeting with Patterson, but Patterson is the Silk City.

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.737
Silk City... This is called Lowell Spindle City.

01:01:21.057 --> 01:01:25.541
Patterson was nicknamed Silk City.

01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:27.443
Or the Venice of America.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.725
They can't take you back.

01:01:29.745 --> 01:01:31.027
I think because of the canals.

01:01:31.747 --> 01:01:32.088
Okay.

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:32.588
Thank you.

01:01:37.613 --> 01:01:38.134
Hey, Barb.

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:58.963
Just look at the little shitty camera.
