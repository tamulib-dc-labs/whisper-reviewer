00:02.512 --> 00:04.474
We're talking to Mr. Wilson.

00:04.494 --> 00:05.215
A.N.

00:07.117 --> 00:09.280
You've caused quite a ruckusle of this book.

00:10.161 --> 00:12.324
And I see you getting out of town just in time for Easter.

00:12.344 --> 00:14.586
I'm getting out of town just in time for Easter.

00:14.606 --> 00:17.069
I don't think it really has caused any trouble, you know.

00:18.311 --> 00:19.712
I'm not aware of any trouble.

00:19.753 --> 00:28.603
There's a little bit of disagreement with some of the more literalists.

00:29.782 --> 00:36.008
But there was nothing in this book which would trouble your average Christian person at all.

00:36.168 --> 00:38.991
Which is important to point out, I think.

00:39.011 --> 00:39.271
Yes.

00:39.351 --> 00:41.914
Of course, you were challenged to this debate.

00:41.974 --> 00:46.839
I was challenged to a debate by an evangelical in England called Tom Wright.

00:46.899 --> 00:49.061
And yes, we don't have a debate.

00:49.942 --> 00:51.864
But I hope it will be a good-humored debate.

00:52.444 --> 00:55.367
And he has, in fact, hasn't he rushed a debate?

00:55.853 --> 01:06.428
Well, you see, I think he was writing a book anyway about Paul, and he's topped and tailed it with the suggestion that this is a reply to my book.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.030
Which makes good marketing sense.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.973
Which makes good marketing sense, I suppose.

01:09.993 --> 01:10.334
Certainly.

01:11.075 --> 01:16.522
Is it a reply to your book?

01:16.583 --> 01:19.026
No, it's a conversation related between...

01:19.276 --> 01:25.985
I mean, his book is a perfectly good book, but it isn't a reply to my book, because I don't think my book is the sort of book which is setting out to have a reply.

01:26.065 --> 01:33.475
I don't mean it's the last word, but it's not positing things which are so controversial they need replying to.

01:33.495 --> 01:38.702
And I think that's important also, is that we don't purport to have uncovered new

01:38.902 --> 01:40.043
Absolutely not.

01:40.063 --> 01:50.012
It's not one of those sort of shock horror books like Holy Blood and the Holy Grail which had Jesus going off to live in the south of France with Mary Magdalene or anything of that kind.

01:50.512 --> 02:07.187
It's really trying to distill what I've read, I suppose I've read 200 or 300 books of modern New Testament scholarship, most of which are very inaccessible to the general reader and I'm trying to distill what scholars over the last 20, 30 years have thought about this stuff.

02:07.657 --> 02:14.865
Maybe written 25, 26 books, I guess, evenly balanced between novels?

02:14.985 --> 02:16.207
Well, chiefly novels.

02:16.967 --> 02:18.709
I mean, I suppose there are about 15 novels.

02:18.810 --> 02:20.431
Okay, so how do you see this?

02:20.491 --> 02:32.425
And even in the nonfiction and the biography, the last two books have quite specifically... Well, I mean, what happened was I was asked to write a book about C.S.

02:32.505 --> 02:33.546
Lewis some years ago.

02:33.948 --> 03:03.246
I was a decade ago and one of the things that struck me was how delicate and sensitive Lewis was as a literary scholar and he urges his readers all the time don't suppose when you pick up a book that's written in the past that you'll be able to understand it at once going into the past is like going into a foreign country and you need to learn its language but when he comes to write his reliefs books he seems to forget that advice

03:04.137 --> 03:33.469
and I was dismayed by re-reading Lewis's religious books I found them so crudely argued it made me want to go and re-discover all the stuff for myself I got interested in it and that was that was how the Jesus book and the Paul book That's a very disappointment in what Lewis does It was a terrible disappointment because he wasn't a scholar in that area he just became a kind of

03:34.715 --> 03:39.083
Evangelical from Belfast, which is what he was in origin.

03:41.387 --> 03:56.293
And I mean, that's a strange thing, but we've all read William James' Psychology, Varieties of Religious Experience, and religion is not a rational part of the brain, it's what happens to the irrational part of ourselves.

03:56.313 --> 03:57.735
And we say this on a day,

03:58.660 --> 04:03.306
that 39 people killed themselves to join up with the spaceship.

04:03.367 --> 04:04.308
Exactly.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.612
They wanted to destroy their containers, as they call the bodies.

04:07.632 --> 04:08.754
They absolutely made it.

04:08.774 --> 04:12.960
To pack their little suitcases with their driver's license in case they were needed in outer space.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.043
I found their website, by the way.

04:15.243 --> 04:16.945
Oh, you found it?

04:17.106 --> 04:17.947
It's off.

04:18.808 --> 04:20.510
I'll tell you how to get it, if you're interested.

04:20.530 --> 04:21.732
I don't have the...

04:22.235 --> 04:23.256
Machinery, I'm afraid.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.919
Well, even at home, you don't have it.

04:25.079 --> 04:25.760
No, too bad.

04:26.100 --> 04:34.331
But you can get it through the Washington Post site, WashingtonPost.com, and then they will... I went through the whole thing this morning.

04:34.411 --> 04:35.413
And this is amazing.

04:36.094 --> 04:41.481
Yeah, well, there's an intelligence over there, and there's ability.

04:41.561 --> 04:47.489
I mean, just the technical ability of creating a site like this with this graphic stuff.

04:47.769 --> 04:49.972
Well, they clearly were very skilled with computers, weren't they?

04:49.992 --> 04:50.453
I mean, they...

04:51.530 --> 04:52.911
That was what they did professionally.

04:53.052 --> 04:54.513
That's what they did professionally.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.977
But then if you read the text, they say that Marianne was here.

04:58.137 --> 05:05.704
I mean, they were absolutely giving you their suicide note on the internet as a group.

05:05.724 --> 05:06.585
That was shocking.

05:06.685 --> 05:09.909
It was one of the most chilling experiences like that.

05:10.589 --> 05:15.134
And one of the frightening things which I... It is pertinent to what we're talking about, if you don't mind.

05:15.194 --> 05:19.258
No, it's highly pertinent, because I think there's this extraordinary distinction, which

05:19.610 --> 05:31.085
If you're outside a religious child, you can make between statements which can be taken as literally true and statements which you can see are really metaphorical, even if the speaker doesn't realize they're metaphorical.

05:31.105 --> 05:36.592
And what so often happens when you get inside a religious mindset is that that distinction becomes blurred.

05:36.852 --> 05:41.578
I'm sorry.

05:41.919 --> 05:44.983
I didn't expect really good coffee.

05:45.243 --> 05:46.044
Oh, she is.

05:46.064 --> 05:47.406
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:47.892 --> 05:48.693
I'm sorry.

05:48.773 --> 05:49.855
That's great.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.960
So, I mean, that's really right.

05:53.721 --> 05:54.302
You're quite right.

05:54.462 --> 06:03.416
I mean, I actually, well, we can talk about that right away, but I do want to get some quotes on the book.

06:04.938 --> 06:06.921
So, Jesus came out of Lewis?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.545
Jesus came very much out of Lewis.

06:09.605 --> 06:15.975
I mean, there's a phrase in one of Lewis's books where he says that there was a man going around in Palestine.

06:16.748 --> 06:18.890
2,000 years ago, claiming to be God.

06:19.531 --> 06:24.295
Now, either that man was telling the truth, in which case we've got to worship him, or he was a liar and a lunatic.

06:25.016 --> 06:25.877
Which do you choose?

06:26.417 --> 06:28.860
And that remark is so crude.

06:28.940 --> 06:40.090
I mean, it suggests total ignorance in the way that the Gospels evolved over many, many years, how they were written down years after Jesus lived, how they were written from the point of view of faith, and so on.

06:40.110 --> 06:41.652
I mean, it's just an astonishing remark.

06:41.672 --> 06:45.996
And yet, when I go about doing radio chat shows or

06:46.415 --> 07:14.987
talkings or phonyers with a literal people quote that to me all the time evangelical Christians they obviously haven't begun to make that intellectual journey which I mean okay it's not surprising some of them haven't but it is amazing that Lewis had not begun to make that journey so once you do of course I think it's very exciting there's no reason to to regard all this stuff as totally destructive

07:15.592 --> 07:17.794
Well, did you see what you were doing as a collective?

07:18.394 --> 07:20.496
No, I didn't.

07:20.556 --> 07:23.179
It simply inspired my own thing.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.442
And did you expect to make new discoveries?

07:27.643 --> 07:29.584
No, I didn't.

07:29.905 --> 07:31.426
I did know enough about the subject.

07:31.466 --> 07:33.608
I studied it in college.

07:34.389 --> 07:40.354
I did know enough about the subject to realise that there isn't anything new here.

07:40.574 --> 07:43.877
What there is new, I think, in the last 10 or 20 years,

07:44.650 --> 07:53.140
is the extent to which scholars have drawn over all this stuff again, and related the New Testament to Jewish literature.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.344
I mean, that's the really new thing that's happened.

07:56.364 --> 08:03.932
Do you think, I did an interview with Robert Fagles a couple of weeks ago, and I don't know if you've had a chance to read his Odyssey or his Iliad.

08:04.353 --> 08:08.157
I've got the Iliad, and I've bought the Odyssey, but I haven't had a chance on it.

08:08.177 --> 08:13.223
It's wonderful, but he says, and I think we all agree, that every generation needs its own...

08:13.692 --> 08:16.195
It's a sad day, even if it's on Shakespeare.

08:17.637 --> 08:19.839
Do you feel the same way with the stories?

08:19.859 --> 08:20.981
I think that's probably true.

08:21.101 --> 08:29.892
And I think certainly every generation needs to look at a figure like Paul, because he's a difficult man to pin down.

08:29.912 --> 08:32.935
I mean, I think everybody makes up their own Jesus.

08:33.736 --> 08:39.463
So it's important to remind yourself where Paul is coming from.

08:40.574 --> 08:44.780
And each generation can see different lights and different perspectives on him.

08:45.101 --> 08:49.507
But as Fagel said, you know, when he's translating, it's inescapable.

08:49.627 --> 08:59.321
I'm writing, I'm doing this in the 1990s, and I have to have James Joyce here, you know, and everything that implies.

09:00.062 --> 09:08.995
And the Greek over here, and I quote, take my idiom, and I stretch it to its limits, and I take his idiom and stretch it to its limits, and I hope that I'll get something

09:09.667 --> 09:12.170
And do you feel that you're doing a similar kind of thing?

09:12.190 --> 09:14.472
Yes, I mean, the whole thing is a matter of translation.

09:14.653 --> 09:34.054
I mean, that's what particularly doing this Paul book has been struck by, that it is literally a matter of translation to start with, because all the concepts with which Paul was dealing with start out as Aramaic and

09:34.658 --> 10:04.632
Hebrew concepts and he's a Greek speaker and a Greek thinker and he's taken him out into the Mediterranean world as soon as he's done that as soon as he's taken a word like Mashiach and called it Christ that's a very subtle shift semantically but it's an enormous shift by the time you've taken it to Corinth or somewhere like that where they don't know anything about the Jewish messianic tradition where they know a lot about demigrants where they've heard about Heracles going down into the underworld and coming up again

10:05.557 --> 10:32.053
and then of course it's an act of translation in the sense that as you were talking about 20th century man or late 20th century man has got to go back and learn the whole mindset of the first century which is only a semi-possible thing to do of course you're bound to fail but unless you try then I don't think you're going to see what the nature of the difficulty is reading an ancient text

10:32.945 --> 10:43.656
Do you enter this as a scholar, as a biographer, as a novelist, as a literary critic, as somebody with an agenda, so to speak, with an open mind?

10:43.676 --> 10:51.605
And again, let's follow the progression from Lewis to Jesus to... I think I've tried to enter it with an open mind.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.369
It's a very difficult thing to do, then.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.532
Because we don't really have open minds.

10:58.652 --> 11:00.894
There is no such thing as an open mind.

11:00.934 --> 11:02.496
Wouldn't it surprise me if you told me?

11:03.083 --> 11:23.070
There's no such thing as an open mind, but thinking of incidents such as we are today in Santiago, and probably, I mean, that's a very, very extreme case, but probably almost every week something in church in the world makes you think religion does very funny things to the mind indeed.

11:23.130 --> 11:30.019
And that doesn't mean one wants to abolish it, or that it should be resisted, but one should be aware of that.

11:31.585 --> 11:34.690
And similarly, probably having non-religious views.

11:35.952 --> 11:41.701
But I... I was trying to approach all this stuff with as open a mind as possible.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.385
To see what kind of sense it made.

11:45.166 --> 11:48.051
After all, I mean, he's been a fantastically influential man, Paul.

11:48.071 --> 11:50.935
It's not so, if I'm just choosing someone, it's your figure.

11:51.596 --> 11:55.903
It being... I mean, you said it made... Christianity.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.827
Okay, that's... With a capital I. Yes.

11:58.847 --> 11:59.348
Okay, yeah.

12:00.273 --> 12:02.356
I'm sorry to interrupt you, go ahead.

12:02.376 --> 12:04.278
No, but I mean, that was really the aim of the book.

12:05.059 --> 12:08.163
It wasn't, I don't think I wrote it with an axe to grind.

12:08.203 --> 12:12.768
I certainly wasn't writing it in all its approval point, all its approval point.

12:12.788 --> 12:21.459
So how about the suggestion that this is iconoclastic and blasphemous, which I've read in a few, you know, British publications?

12:21.479 --> 12:23.481
I think that's just ridiculous.

12:23.501 --> 12:25.364
There is very, very little here in this book.

12:25.384 --> 12:28.828
In fact, nothing that you wouldn't have heard in any theological seminary or

12:30.462 --> 12:32.504
religious knowledge for the last hundred years.

12:32.805 --> 12:34.046
There's nothing new here.

12:34.847 --> 12:42.976
Casey suggests you're a heretic, which is quite a choice of... Oh, John Casey in the English paper.

12:43.416 --> 12:44.557
Yes, well, I mean, that's okay.

12:44.597 --> 12:52.926
I don't mind being a heretic, but I'm sure I am by some people's standards.

12:53.627 --> 12:55.869
You see, even that question is an interesting one.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.153
How much can a

12:59.875 --> 13:03.399
a Christian who's been through all this stuff.

13:03.419 --> 13:10.087
I'm rather detached from religious belief myself at the moment, but how much do the committee Christians accept all this?

13:10.107 --> 13:15.914
And I don't see any intellectual reason why they shouldn't accept the kind of approaches that you find in my book.

13:16.455 --> 13:28.549
We had a very interesting radio discussion in Chicago a couple of days ago with two professors from Chicago University.

13:29.137 --> 13:58.688
the divintist ruler one of whom was a Roman Catholic the other of whom was Protestant they were entirely accepting of the kind of things the civic rights were about entirely that's in fact I mean one of them who was in fact a Christian minister was much more extreme than I was I mean he didn't think we could really know anything at all certainly historically about

13:59.073 --> 14:00.114
Jesus, for instance.

14:00.975 --> 14:06.460
And he didn't think that any of the Christian literature really gets going until the second century.

14:08.422 --> 14:15.228
And that if we read Paul in his original context, we probably wouldn't even think of... I mean, I don't think Paul was a Christian in the modern sense.

14:15.709 --> 14:20.734
But he didn't think... He thinks of Paul simply as a Jewish herity.

14:21.194 --> 14:25.418
And of course, did you point out that Paul didn't consider Jesus the...

14:26.562 --> 14:28.905
Well, Paul doesn't use the word Christianity.

14:29.005 --> 14:34.933
He uses the word Christ, but he uses the word Christ as a development of the word Messiah.

14:36.435 --> 14:39.799
And that's all he's talking about.

14:39.859 --> 14:44.105
He's talking, in the first instance, he's talking to Jews about Judaism.

14:44.325 --> 14:49.011
And then when they reject what he says, he begins to talk to Gentiles.

14:50.013 --> 14:55.540
But even talking to Gentiles, he's talking about what he believes to be the truth and secret of Judaism.

14:56.465 --> 14:59.348
why is it significant that his father is a tent maker?

15:00.289 --> 15:24.936
I don't think it is significant particularly even if it's true it's certainly true that he undertook a trade because he writes about that in his letters but he doesn't spell out very much what it is and Luke tells us he was a tent maker there are several inferences you can draw from that one is if he was a tent maker

15:25.372 --> 15:37.728
who was he making the tents for, and a German astrologer, Martin Hengel, argues quite convincingly that Paul's father was making tents for the Roman legionaries.

15:38.409 --> 15:52.628
This puts you, if you're a first century Jew, even a Jew of the diaspora, not in an ambivalent position, but in a position which is very different from the Palestinian Jews like Jesus.

15:53.249 --> 16:01.362
Because it means that you are very much accepting the political status quo, the existence of the empire, the existence of the soldiers.

16:02.463 --> 16:13.360
And it also, I mean, if you were thinking absolutely strictly, although there were Jewish temptations and leather workers, there's nothing wrong with it.

16:15.263 --> 16:20.792
When you actually get to the business of tanning the hide, you're...

16:21.295 --> 16:50.475
you're in danger there of getting corpse pollution and corpse impurity which would need special purification rituals so in other words Paul is one of those many many Jews the Jews of the diaspora greatly outnumbered the Jews of Judea and Galilee and they I mean the Alexandrian ones

16:50.894 --> 16:59.967
more or less plateness, and they, no more Jews in Alexandria than there were anywhere else in the Mediterranean at that time.

16:59.987 --> 17:01.430
It was sort of New York.

17:01.450 --> 17:08.580
I actually wouldn't let Alexander here in my own court.

17:09.101 --> 17:18.775
They were all coming to terms with things, and the whole situation was much more pluralist and much more fluid and complicated.

17:20.392 --> 17:27.661
some people sometimes realize and they think there's one thing called Christianity and one thing called Judaism who will hop from one to the other.

17:28.542 --> 17:31.846
Well, the book reads beautifully.

17:31.946 --> 17:40.557
I don't have to wonder, I think I know the answer, but I wonder if you can express for me the importance of narrative in human fiction.

17:42.339 --> 17:44.381
You are telling a story here, I believe.

17:44.401 --> 17:45.383
I think I'm telling a story.

17:45.423 --> 17:47.445
It's rather hard to put it in.

17:49.822 --> 17:53.928
I mean, yes, it's very important for me that a book should read fluently.

17:57.613 --> 18:09.170
And I suppose, I mean, I am primarily a novelist, so that if this book has a fault, it is perhaps that I'm trying to fill in the gaps between areas which we don't know anything about.

18:09.691 --> 18:14.017
And is there a temptation there to wager the head of the novelist?

18:14.037 --> 18:14.558
Yes, there is.

18:15.138 --> 18:18.343
And I hope that I've ladled all those bits in the book quite clearly.

18:20.045 --> 18:21.908
That we are making imaginative leaps.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.149
We are making imaginative leaps.

18:23.170 --> 18:28.377
I mean, such as whether Jesus and Paul never sit eyes upon one another.

18:28.397 --> 18:30.500
I don't think there's any harm in making imaginative leaps.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.381
As long as you identify.

18:31.441 --> 18:32.543
As long as you identify.

18:35.467 --> 18:44.981
So telling the story is... When you set out... I mean, what is it, four or five biographies now?

18:45.061 --> 18:46.603
It's Holstoy one, of course.

18:47.705 --> 18:49.107
Again, it's...

18:51.078 --> 18:55.503
It's not just documenting a life, in your view, I would guess.

18:55.563 --> 18:56.725
No, it's not.

18:56.745 --> 18:57.105
It's not.

18:57.245 --> 19:05.796
And I think probably in terms of actual technique, I don't make much distinction between writing fiction and writing nonfiction.

19:07.898 --> 19:20.173
I think probably, I think, I mean, in terms of the actual architectonics of the book, I plan it out, whether it's fiction or nonfiction.

19:20.947 --> 19:28.915
Obviously, the planning in each case is going to be very different, because in fiction I'm dreaming is half in non-fiction, I'm doing research.

19:30.196 --> 19:34.961
But when it actually comes to writing it, I certainly do want it to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

19:36.762 --> 19:44.870
Just an hour ago, I had an interview with a woman, Anne Michaels, a novelist from Canada, an excellent book called Future of Jesus.

19:45.871 --> 19:50.616
But she's a poet, you know, and the first young, 38 years old,

19:51.001 --> 19:52.524
Very interesting.

19:52.544 --> 19:55.970
I mean, how often do you interview a poet?

19:55.990 --> 19:57.052
Usually it's the other way around.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.156
It's a novelist who aspires poetry.

19:59.697 --> 20:05.228
And we're discussing the same kinds of, the same concepts.

20:06.711 --> 20:09.035
Again, it does come out of narrative, doesn't it?

20:09.055 --> 20:11.119
And of course, it's really searching

20:11.943 --> 20:13.905
getting lost in finding perfect work.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.049
You know, get yourself mired in your book.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.051
I mean, you've got to work here.

20:19.852 --> 20:24.177
You've got to keep your eye on the ball, as we say here in baseball.

20:24.217 --> 20:25.779
You've got to keep your eye on the ball.

20:26.340 --> 20:30.324
Otherwise, if you lose it, then the reader loses it.

20:33.908 --> 20:36.972
It seems while we're done, I'm not asking you a lot of questions about the book.

20:37.728 --> 20:39.470
It doesn't seem nice at all to me.

20:39.670 --> 20:41.112
Okay, good.

20:41.172 --> 20:43.955
That's my job to read the book.

20:44.176 --> 20:44.956
No, no.

20:45.157 --> 20:46.718
I'm very happy with the word.

20:46.819 --> 20:48.140
Oh, good.

20:48.541 --> 20:57.471
You'll see, I write these literary essays that draw from my reading of the book and then from this little interaction.

20:58.312 --> 21:04.459
And I do have 25 newspapers in largely university towns, so they'll love this.

21:04.479 --> 21:06.081
This is perfect for my readers.

21:06.820 --> 21:14.628
from Eugene, Oregon to Salt Lake City, Charlottesville, Boston, Columbus.

21:14.728 --> 21:15.309
It's perfect.

21:15.329 --> 21:17.491
I heard you were coming here.

21:17.951 --> 21:19.333
It's quite great.

21:19.353 --> 21:20.734
I had the opportunity to chat.

21:20.754 --> 21:22.135
No, it's wonderful to meet you.

21:23.597 --> 21:25.639
I want to read your Alexandra, but what's it?

21:25.719 --> 21:28.302
Well, did you notice I'm wearing a bobbly tie today?

21:28.362 --> 21:29.203
Oh, yes, I can see it.

21:29.223 --> 21:29.943
I wore this for you.

21:30.003 --> 21:33.587
I said, my goodness, this is an Oxford scholar.

21:34.276 --> 21:36.219
My book really isn't about Alexandria.

21:36.239 --> 21:37.841
It's about bibliomania.

21:37.941 --> 21:41.085
It's about 2,500 years of... Oh, how wonderful.

21:41.105 --> 21:43.269
It's the great library of Alexandria.

21:43.349 --> 21:45.391
And there's another bit of bibliomania.

21:45.432 --> 21:46.213
Precisely, yeah.

21:46.233 --> 21:48.235
This was my second trip up just two weeks ago.

21:48.255 --> 21:49.197
What a marvelous subject.

21:50.479 --> 21:51.880
It's called The Gentle Madness.

21:51.981 --> 21:53.843
I should write it in my cart.

21:57.749 --> 21:58.710
No, I should very much like it.

21:58.730 --> 21:59.832
It's a very interesting book.

22:00.392 --> 22:03.777
I think if you give me your address, maybe I'll have my publisher send you a copy.

22:04.752 --> 22:07.175
sixth printing now, I'm pleased to say.

22:07.215 --> 22:09.419
That's wonderful.

22:09.439 --> 22:10.340
Who is your publisher?

22:10.360 --> 22:10.580
Holt.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.723
Henry Holt is the publisher.

22:12.743 --> 22:12.924
Oh, yes.

22:12.944 --> 22:17.690
The book was shortlisted last year for the National Book Critic Circle Award.

22:19.052 --> 22:22.978
I had a chapter in there, Rule of Retirement, and we still never met a British publisher.

22:23.038 --> 22:23.999
How do you figure that?

22:24.720 --> 22:31.069
I'm told that it's very hard to sell a 638-page book to a market.

22:31.951 --> 22:32.892
It's amazing.

22:32.952 --> 22:33.713
If it's a book,

22:34.064 --> 22:36.126
the general phenomenon of Biblio mania.

22:36.787 --> 22:39.890
I'm amazed you have... I'm amazed, really, because it is.

22:39.910 --> 22:46.737
The title of the book is A Gentle Madness Called Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

22:47.478 --> 22:56.327
And half is history, and then the other half is journalistic, just documenting these very interesting stories over the last 30 years or so.

22:56.347 --> 22:58.169
The Great Book Thief of Biblio.

22:59.230 --> 23:01.152
There were a lot of British resonances to it.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.418
But anyway, that says neither here nor there.

23:03.518 --> 23:04.780
Oh, it's a wonderful story.

23:04.940 --> 23:06.843
I am just definitely going to get rid of a child.

23:06.863 --> 23:14.914
What I'll do is I'll get some friend in New York to... Well, if you give me your card, I'll be happy to have... I don't have a child, but I'll write it down.

23:14.954 --> 23:16.436
I'll be happy to have sent you one.

23:16.536 --> 23:17.517
I'll write it down here.

23:18.178 --> 23:19.720
I'll be writing it right there.

23:19.740 --> 23:19.981
Okay.

23:20.041 --> 23:28.172
Because... I'm sorry, you don't mind chatting around like this, do you?

23:28.192 --> 23:29.113
Well, they don't have parents.

23:29.836 --> 23:31.679
I've been talking about this all week.

23:33.602 --> 23:37.769
My job is to read the book, it seems to me.

23:37.789 --> 23:42.436
I did an interview with Robert Coles a couple of months ago in this new book.

23:43.438 --> 23:50.569
And of course, he believes, and he's a psychiatrist for children, and he's written a Miss Tolstoy, one of his great heroes.

23:50.649 --> 23:56.198
And he says that he always loves to use stories.

23:57.663 --> 24:05.250
in his classes and with children, and he said when he was a child, his mother said, you have to have stories that you can live your life by.

24:05.270 --> 24:07.892
Do you agree with that?

24:08.012 --> 24:08.313
Yes.

24:10.134 --> 24:12.857
I'm writing a new book now, by the way.

24:12.877 --> 24:22.105
I mean, one of my novels, well, in fact, several of my novels have really dealt with this sort of thing.

24:22.205 --> 24:25.408
I've written a sort of five volume, no,

24:26.519 --> 24:31.043
The final one which came out this spring, I think, was it last year?

24:31.063 --> 24:39.572
But, I mean, the central one of that actually has a character who's obsessed by this theme of the myths that we live by and the stories that we live by.

24:40.353 --> 24:44.276
Which is, of course... It's called Daughters of Albion.

24:45.197 --> 24:50.443
And... It's one of my really pet themes.

24:50.603 --> 24:52.965
I mean, this is why...

24:53.300 --> 25:02.777
This is why Julian was so fantastically popular in the ancient world, not just to... Do you mind talking about this at another time, by the way, too?

25:02.797 --> 25:06.002
I mean, now, but if I contact you... No, no, I'd love to talk about it.

25:06.083 --> 25:08.547
I'm coming back for further research.

25:09.208 --> 25:14.257
But maybe... This is a meditation of book culture in the years of a new millennium.

25:15.079 --> 25:17.603
Book places, libraries, book people.

25:18.157 --> 25:28.268
books of the future, libraries of history, the canon wars, the readers, all kinds of stuff.

25:28.308 --> 25:31.351
It's a very nice idea, isn't it?

25:31.371 --> 25:35.476
It's getting... I actually get something out of this Hale-Walk thing.

25:37.217 --> 25:38.459
This really gets me.

25:38.479 --> 25:40.401
I've been studying computers.

25:40.761 --> 25:41.943
I don't want to hear this on tape.

25:41.963 --> 25:44.265
I have to transcribe this one.

25:44.650 --> 25:50.979
I really make a tremendous parallel between what happened with these people and the Unabomber.

25:50.999 --> 25:52.502
It's always chilling, you know.

25:52.582 --> 25:54.464
Are you familiar with the Unabomber story?

25:55.346 --> 26:00.814
The guy who, the big story that we had last year, the guy who was blowing people up with a letter bomb?

26:00.834 --> 26:02.777
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

26:03.097 --> 26:04.940
Extraordinary story.

26:05.100 --> 26:12.531
And as far as I'm concerned, it's the first time in history where somebody's book was published

26:12.730 --> 26:16.574
under the threat that if you don't publish my book, I'm going to continue to kill people.

26:17.756 --> 26:18.176
And he did.

26:18.196 --> 26:19.618
And what was he railing against?

26:19.778 --> 26:21.300
Technology and computers.

26:22.241 --> 26:25.204
And he lived in a shack and he typed in an old typewriter.

26:25.785 --> 26:28.327
And how did he get caught?

26:28.347 --> 26:29.328
By the computer.

26:29.389 --> 26:35.876
His brother read this manifesto on a computer and his brother recognized him.

26:36.336 --> 26:38.839
Now you go just to the flip side, you have these

26:39.697 --> 26:45.886
People who make their livelihood from computers and who actually communicate by computer.

26:46.346 --> 26:47.808
This guy was killing other people.

26:47.848 --> 26:48.549
Who do they kill?

26:48.570 --> 26:49.270
They killed himself.

26:49.371 --> 26:49.751
I don't know.

26:49.771 --> 26:55.039
I haven't made a connection to him yet, but it's really something there.

26:55.359 --> 26:56.260
And it's technology.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.804
And of course, the other guy was alive.

26:58.964 --> 27:00.306
I mean, and he was brilliant.

27:00.326 --> 27:01.648
And they're all brilliant, by the way.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.790
This is also very interesting.

27:02.810 --> 27:03.831
That is very interesting, yes.

27:04.908 --> 27:09.774
They are all brilliant, because, I mean, you need high imagination to develop some of these nutty ideas.

27:12.758 --> 27:14.680
And that's a really scary thing.

27:14.760 --> 27:19.727
But you're talking about the little novel in here.

27:20.387 --> 27:24.753
Yes, but I mean, it just comes into that, the idea of the stories by which people live.

27:24.813 --> 27:28.357
I mean, reverting to your psychology strength.

27:28.377 --> 27:30.941
You continue to be a literary editor, is this correct?

27:31.922 --> 27:32.923
I've just...

27:33.106 --> 27:34.288
Actually doing that up.

27:34.308 --> 27:35.590
Okay.

27:36.111 --> 27:39.075
I'm still doing some journalism on the Evening Standard.

27:39.136 --> 27:42.280
But how is it, how do you feel about books?

27:42.861 --> 27:59.147
If I were to tell you, for instance, a major university, Ivy League University, I've discovered this one, has been ordered by their trustees to reduce the size of their collections from 6.8 million to 6 million by the year 2000.

27:59.988 --> 28:06.774
Now, not only are they going to cut 800,000 books out of their collections... That means that they're not going to be buying a new one.

28:06.834 --> 28:09.456
It also means that they're going to these things.

28:13.080 --> 28:22.388
If you put it simply like that, then I would be chilled... I'd be chilled by that, and I would think that is terrible.

28:23.289 --> 28:27.953
And the days of Philistinism and darkness are upon us, but if, as I do,

28:28.355 --> 28:40.013
or as I did for the last seven years, you sit in an office in the Evening Standard in London, and you watch how many novels are published in England alone each week.

28:40.033 --> 28:42.016
I think it's something like 500 a week.

28:42.477 --> 28:47.004
I think England does 90,000 titles a year, which is more than... 90,000 titles a year.

28:47.064 --> 28:50.129
That was David Brantman who told me that it would be great.

28:50.149 --> 28:51.611
You might believe that, you see.

28:51.631 --> 28:55.097
And an awful lot of it is absolutely rubbish.

28:55.497 --> 28:55.898
Full of it.

28:56.654 --> 28:58.756
It wouldn't be worth a university.

28:59.016 --> 29:11.048
When you think that the copyright libraries, the Library of Congress, British Library, the Library in Dublin, whatever it's called, National Library of Ireland, or Trinity, it's Trinity Library, isn't it?

29:12.349 --> 29:16.873
But they are obliged to take every single one of those volumes.

29:16.893 --> 29:17.333
That's right.

29:17.353 --> 29:19.055
It's only the Library of Congress here.

29:19.095 --> 29:20.697
Because as I say, the Library of Congress.

29:20.817 --> 29:23.960
No, I'm not taking a short word.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.442
I mean, some kind of judicious

29:26.658 --> 29:55.872
the garbage would seem to make sense, but on the other hand it seems for this time it seems sad for those of us who are all bookmen, but not only that but you do find now uh Nicholson Baker the San Francisco thing which is written about the New Yorker and that's just one element that he found that the San Francisco Library was very quietly getting rid of books, but that's fine a lot of people it's not fine, but a lot of libraries have been doing it but they're old books.

29:56.611 --> 29:58.194
and I've gotten a few of these titles.

29:58.214 --> 30:02.300
You'd be amazed at how many of these books we've got the titles.

30:03.402 --> 30:11.855
That's probably only, there are only two or three copies of these left in libraries in the United States, and we can just determine this online.

30:11.875 --> 30:15.241
It's all online now, so you can read library 10 books.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.763
You can basically determine

30:17.114 --> 30:20.061
You can quite specifically determine, I've done it.

30:20.101 --> 30:20.843
They've shown it to me.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.366
They've punched up my book.

30:22.587 --> 30:28.120
I know exactly which libraries in Ohio will have it and how many copies they have.

30:28.775 --> 30:31.039
You can just, you know, run this out.

30:31.800 --> 30:36.147
People are maybe unknowingly getting rid of the last book in many instances.

30:36.588 --> 30:38.651
So I'm dealing with this.

30:38.691 --> 30:40.434
This is absolutely fascinating stuff.

30:40.514 --> 30:41.475
It's interesting, isn't it?

30:41.536 --> 30:41.696
Yeah.

30:42.016 --> 30:42.297
It's fun.

30:42.337 --> 30:44.500
I honestly don't know where it's going just yet.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.642
I didn't know where it's fun.

30:45.662 --> 30:46.644
I mean, I know what I'm doing.

30:46.664 --> 30:51.171
But when I talk to a book man, I love to just...

30:52.147 --> 31:21.563
see what you think this isn't touching my book it's just in brackets one of the things that's happening with Christianity and if you had to say what is Christianity most people would think Christianity was the religion of the book just as Judaism and Islam is but in fact it was very much an oral tradition and a cult around certain rights particularly the Eucharist years and years before

31:22.133 --> 31:24.196
Anybody who thought of writing is all done.

31:24.296 --> 31:26.218
And really it's only when it gets written down.

31:28.080 --> 31:37.092
And when it gets gathered into a written canon, probably 200 years after it writes, that it becomes something that you can define.

31:37.172 --> 31:43.760
And then this sort of orthodox can start past choosing the heretics and all hell from the letter.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.684
And it turns into a different ballgame altogether.

31:47.024 --> 31:49.187
Do you consider yourself and England with

31:50.990 --> 31:55.454
canon awards that are similarly going on here.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.357
You mean things like the Harold Linden book on the Jacqueline?

31:58.878 --> 31:59.959
Yes, very much so.

31:59.979 --> 32:02.401
For instance, you can get a degree.

32:03.602 --> 32:09.368
I have evidence of, I told this to Fabian, he knew a lot, because he graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College.

32:10.269 --> 32:14.774
Amherst College graduated, summa cum laude graduated.

32:14.794 --> 32:16.095
I was going to say the same.

32:16.155 --> 32:16.255
Okay.

32:16.420 --> 32:17.401
Just to let you know.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.364
25 minutes.

32:19.384 --> 32:21.266
Well, let's give us a few more minutes.

32:21.286 --> 32:22.007
You don't mind, do you?

32:22.027 --> 32:22.307
No, no.

32:23.268 --> 32:39.968
In English, not literature, English, literature, and this individual never took a course in Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, Trident, and was granted not only a degree in English literature, but was graduating summa cum laude.

32:42.011 --> 32:43.252
That bothers me.

32:43.393 --> 32:45.415
It bothers me, and I was...

32:45.732 --> 32:47.294
wholly on Bloom's side.

32:47.995 --> 32:50.077
I interviewed him for this new book, by the way.

32:50.137 --> 32:51.619
I thought it was a terrific book.

32:51.639 --> 32:52.400
Yeah.

32:52.420 --> 32:58.707
But of course, all this sort of thing goes on in England and in Europe, just as might have been done in the United States.

32:58.787 --> 32:59.488
But it's politically driven.

32:59.508 --> 33:01.030
That's what bothers me.

33:01.050 --> 33:02.051
Is it the same?

33:02.071 --> 33:02.752
Yeah, it's atrocity.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.553
Of course it is.

33:06.276 --> 33:09.540
And it's the same insidious, but it's like they're behind it, maybe.

33:09.660 --> 33:14.085
Do you find the same battles going on in the universities?

33:14.993 --> 33:20.181
I think that, I wish they did, but I mean, in a lot of English universities, there isn't a battle.

33:20.221 --> 33:23.546
They've given up.

33:23.566 --> 33:24.668
They've given up.

33:24.708 --> 33:28.654
There was just a big story in the globe about this professor at BU who wrote in the T.S.

33:28.674 --> 33:36.466
Eliot book, and he's been forced to resign from the English department because of his very conservative views on what English literature is.

33:37.327 --> 33:38.129
I'm dealing with that.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.292
Well, it's just fascinating to us.

33:40.897 --> 33:42.359
Oh, you gave me your address.

33:42.559 --> 33:42.939
Okay.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.781
Can I have a phone number?

33:43.801 --> 33:44.281
Do you mind?

33:45.863 --> 33:46.664
Why don't I light you?

33:46.684 --> 33:46.904
Write me.

33:46.964 --> 33:48.466
It's better to write me.

33:48.566 --> 33:53.012
And if you'd inscribe this book for me, I'd be delighted.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.474
Give me a pen.

33:54.494 --> 33:58.719
If I could have a pen, yes, please.

33:58.739 --> 33:59.039
I have one.

33:59.940 --> 34:00.561
This is ink.

34:01.422 --> 34:03.805
That's terrific.

34:03.825 --> 34:04.826
This is good.

34:04.846 --> 34:05.487
I'm so angry.
