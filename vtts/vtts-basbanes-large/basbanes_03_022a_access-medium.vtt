WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:03.779
Right.

00:04.079 --> 00:06.625
Well, I mean, I'm loaded with stories.

00:06.645 --> 00:09.811
Okay, so I'm on and we're talking to Bob.

00:09.851 --> 00:11.715
What do you call this room here, Bob?

00:12.156 --> 00:17.226
This is my, actually, I lovingly call it the weird room.

00:17.246 --> 00:17.687
The weird room.

00:17.888 --> 00:18.990
And I have my TV down there.

00:19.050 --> 00:20.453
I go up here, close the door.

00:20.553 --> 00:23.980
Just tell me again briefly what you have in here, some of the things.

00:24.331 --> 00:28.296
The things that mean the most to me, actually.

00:28.356 --> 00:29.958
My shrunken head collection.

00:30.178 --> 00:31.880
How many shrunken heads in the collection?

00:33.082 --> 00:33.843
My skulls.

00:34.624 --> 00:39.991
Some Klu Klux Klan outfits, which offend a lot of people, but I love the history of it.

00:40.011 --> 00:47.480
Well, somebody has to collect, document the seeds of hate.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.241
That's right, that's right.

00:48.261 --> 00:50.984
Somebody has to keep that stuff.

00:51.004 --> 00:53.848
And I say that in my new books that I use all the time.

00:54.318 --> 00:57.460
I'm still a bibliophile, I don't go to the computer as much as I...

00:57.760 --> 01:00.664
I can find it in the book by the time they turn on the computer.

01:01.005 --> 01:04.029
So you might have said it again, how many shrunken heads?

01:04.049 --> 01:04.310
Thirty-eight.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.854
Thirty-eight, and how many skulls do we have?

01:07.334 --> 01:10.719
I've got about forty-five skulls, and most of them have history.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.762
All of them have history to them.

01:12.802 --> 01:16.027
You're anticipating, so you don't even know who they are in many cases.

01:16.067 --> 01:16.868
Some I do, yes.

01:17.529 --> 01:20.454
I mean, like one I got when I was sixteen years old.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.819
It came from the site of the Washington DC.

01:23.839 --> 01:25.962
He was a Confederate Civil War soldier.

01:25.942 --> 01:35.357
I don't know who he was, but... And then I've had friends of people look at him and tell me the sizes of the heads and the weights and the heights and all that kind of thing.

01:35.377 --> 01:38.362
Hey, Alan, I'm going to show you this.

01:38.922 --> 01:39.764
Look, look at this.

01:39.784 --> 01:41.707
Yeah, what is that?

01:42.308 --> 01:50.781
Yeah, it's Frazier's wife who did, you know... But this is... Wow!

01:50.881 --> 01:51.983
Oh, I bet!

01:52.604 --> 01:53.345
Where did that map?

01:53.365 --> 01:55.289
Off in the federal building.

01:55.309 --> 01:56.090
I don't know which building.

01:56.210 --> 02:00.017
Syracuse University has the... Isn't it standard?

02:00.037 --> 02:00.718
I'm going to find out.

02:00.998 --> 02:01.599
Amazing.

02:02.441 --> 02:07.109
But it was done in 1932 for the... So, Bob, you said that you haven't really documented.

02:07.129 --> 02:13.600
I mean, you're not documented so much, but you haven't really catalogued... No, but I'm starting slowly, but it's a very...

02:13.580 --> 02:15.944
You need a computer for that, you know.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.711
Yeah, well, what I'm going to do is... So you're opening a book right now that's a skull collection.

02:20.791 --> 02:32.769
Right, but I've taken photographs, and I've got documents for each one, so I'm going to document them, and I have them... Well, I have them all written up, and... Hey, Bob, whose name is this?

02:32.789 --> 02:33.330
George Washington.

02:33.350 --> 02:37.036
Yeah, we don't want to talk about that too much.

02:37.056 --> 02:37.616
Say that again?

02:38.037 --> 02:40.481
We don't want to talk about that.

02:40.501 --> 02:41.983
There's another piece we don't want to talk about is

02:42.807 --> 02:48.235
The Attorney General of the United States' head over there, William Wirt, who ran for the presidency.

02:48.876 --> 02:49.456
So what happened?

02:49.476 --> 02:51.960
How did it... It was grave rob in the 60s.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.162
It was a congressional cemetery.

02:53.342 --> 02:56.967
I didn't do it, but it's a piece that I really admire.

02:56.987 --> 02:59.570
I've given William Wirt more credit than he's due, actually.

02:59.631 --> 03:04.317
So we said this is Washington's hair here?

03:04.337 --> 03:04.457
No.

03:04.477 --> 03:07.361
This was in the Birkin Herbert Bank for years.

03:07.702 --> 03:07.802
Yeah.

03:08.744 --> 03:10.106
It's just a wild piece.

03:10.726 --> 03:13.570
If it's not his finger, it's somebody's finger.

03:14.591 --> 03:18.315
Is that what I think it is?

03:18.335 --> 03:20.718
No, I got this about 87.

03:20.918 --> 03:26.805
This is wood from Washington's tomb.

03:27.026 --> 03:29.609
So who rubbed Washington's tomb?

03:29.669 --> 03:36.557
In 1830, they moved from the old tomb to the new tomb, which is that.

03:36.892 --> 03:38.395
That would make sense.

03:38.415 --> 03:40.999
Isn't this a wonderful piece?

03:41.019 --> 03:41.560
Look what it's on.

03:41.981 --> 03:42.362
A barrel.

03:45.587 --> 03:46.449
So finish the story.

03:47.591 --> 03:57.128
So they dug him up under a military guard and they thought they'd pick him up and they invited the Kremlin Society to view the father of our country's reburial.

03:57.665 --> 04:01.151
All these big wigs from Alexander standing around, the casket fell apart.

04:01.471 --> 04:02.032
And there he was.

04:02.212 --> 04:02.954
It splattered.

04:02.974 --> 04:04.837
Yeah, so it's a chestnut casket.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.639
So they had to go to Alexander and get another casket.

04:06.659 --> 04:07.661
So his remains were?

04:07.681 --> 04:08.743
Were splattered.

04:09.063 --> 04:10.746
Now, was it Jim Burke?

04:11.387 --> 04:12.589
It was Jim Burke.

04:12.749 --> 04:13.851
So Jim Burke.

04:14.624 --> 04:17.186
great-grandfather got it.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.508
From Lear.

04:18.868 --> 04:23.072
It was always in the lobby and then was brought upstairs and put in the vault, right?

04:23.332 --> 04:23.993
I believe.

04:24.433 --> 04:28.137
Originally they put it in the lobby and people thought it was offensive.

04:28.237 --> 04:30.279
It was there for like a long time.

04:30.299 --> 04:31.660
Then they put it in the vault.

04:31.700 --> 04:37.025
Then Jim Burke the 4th supposedly sold it to Larry.

04:37.266 --> 04:40.088
Larry got really friendly with him and all that shit.

04:40.148 --> 04:41.830
And then Larry purportedly

04:42.721 --> 04:52.556
Mount Vernon knows that I have it, but the fact that I don't display it or do anything with it, they're okay with it, so they're like pissed that I have it.

04:52.616 --> 04:53.938
You bought this from Larry.

04:55.620 --> 05:01.489
This is the last thing you bought from Larry that I walked in with Larry.

05:01.925 --> 05:03.648
3,000-year-old sarcophagus.

05:03.728 --> 05:04.590
Yeah, I remember that.

05:04.790 --> 05:05.291
Okay?

05:05.672 --> 05:07.335
Larry didn't have ownership of that.

05:07.355 --> 05:07.957
I know.

05:07.977 --> 05:09.239
I paid him like 10 grand for it.

05:09.259 --> 05:09.720
Right.

05:09.740 --> 05:12.225
He calls me up and says, I gotta have that back.

05:12.305 --> 05:13.066
Yeah, I remember that.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.431
So I said, well, Larry, you're a friend.

05:15.491 --> 05:16.272
I'll give it back to you.

05:16.453 --> 05:17.655
I don't have the 10 grand.

05:17.838 --> 05:18.939
I said, we know what I want.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.862
And he went, I can't get rid of that.

05:20.982 --> 05:24.086
And I go, well, you know where it is if we want to do that.

05:24.507 --> 05:27.030
So he gave me that and traded for the money.

05:27.571 --> 05:29.914
That's when I signed on as Larry's executive.

05:29.934 --> 05:31.456
That's exactly what I was having.

05:31.476 --> 05:32.597
The sarcophagus vanished.

05:32.737 --> 05:33.658
I knew you had gotten it.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.040
Well, he sent it back to somebody else.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.403
I know exactly what happened because he owed that to me.

05:37.423 --> 05:37.844
Okay.

05:37.864 --> 05:39.206
Okay, because I lent him the money.

05:40.147 --> 05:41.909
Okay, this puts it all together.

05:42.490 --> 05:46.495
Okay, now you can basically clean up a graph of about two months of my life.

05:46.829 --> 05:47.570
With Larry.

05:47.590 --> 05:48.331
Yeah.

05:48.351 --> 05:49.112
Okay.

05:49.132 --> 05:51.815
You had stopped working with him for a short period of time.

05:51.835 --> 05:54.498
He called me up, asked me to become the executive of the state to get the money.

05:54.578 --> 05:55.480
I really wasn't working.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.281
We were just friends.

05:56.341 --> 05:57.702
Well, he was using you.

05:57.762 --> 05:59.444
No, he would tell everybody different stories.

05:59.464 --> 05:59.825
Yeah, here he is.

05:59.845 --> 06:00.506
We were just friends.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.667
I mean, we were just friends.

06:01.687 --> 06:03.850
I was meeting once in a while in the parking lot at NASA.

06:03.870 --> 06:04.090
Right.

06:04.651 --> 06:05.652
So, Larry, where?

06:05.692 --> 06:06.273
Larry, Bob.

06:06.553 --> 06:08.475
That is from Bergen-Belsen.

06:08.495 --> 06:09.136
That's an original.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.741
She's wearing one from Bergen-Belsen.

06:12.761 --> 06:15.604
It's much higher, but that's an original from Bergen-Belsen.

06:15.922 --> 06:18.685
A town right near there was found in an attic.

06:19.226 --> 06:23.251
You know, when they released prisoners, they just went out and did their jobs.

06:25.113 --> 06:32.943
And a lot of this stuff is stuff that I had when I was little, like the Mickey Mouse clock and my Hopalong Cassidy boots and things mixed in, you know.

06:33.424 --> 06:35.466
It's memories, but you know.

06:35.486 --> 06:37.128
Shoes from Mount Halston.

06:37.308 --> 06:38.710
This is a Jewish woman's head.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.292
This is the only head that didn't make

06:40.694 --> 06:43.136
the book, because it's way too offensive.

06:43.156 --> 06:44.178
Which head is this?

06:44.278 --> 06:47.701
This is the head of a Jewish woman from Buchenwald.

06:47.801 --> 06:48.662
They shrunk it?

06:48.682 --> 06:50.404
Yeah, it was from Kud's name.

06:51.205 --> 06:51.765
Who's a woman?

06:51.885 --> 06:55.249
She was the doctor, she's the wife of the woman.

06:55.269 --> 06:56.130
Why did they do that?

06:56.430 --> 06:57.951
They used them for paperweights.

06:58.152 --> 06:59.213
They used them for paperweights.

06:59.873 --> 07:00.774
See the base?

07:00.894 --> 07:03.137
It's exactly, these are the ones that were on it.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.698
That's horrible.

07:04.778 --> 07:05.479
It's horrible.

07:05.499 --> 07:07.461
They used human skin.

07:07.762 --> 07:11.167
I don't want to handle it.

07:11.447 --> 07:12.369
No, I'm not going to.

07:12.609 --> 07:13.390
I would never do that.

07:13.430 --> 07:14.712
No, no, no.

07:14.732 --> 07:22.343
I just want you to see that here's a booting ball.

07:23.745 --> 07:25.247
This is the evidence table.

07:25.287 --> 07:27.210
It's an original signal for a photograph.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.533
You see two shrunken heads here, and these are the prisoners holding it up.

07:30.003 --> 07:30.984
People go, they didn't do that.

07:31.024 --> 07:32.867
Well, here's all the tattoos and lampshades.

07:32.887 --> 07:33.788
How could they deny this?

07:33.808 --> 07:34.489
Oh, that's crazy.

07:34.589 --> 07:36.451
You know, I just finished appraising yesterday.

07:36.592 --> 07:41.038
You know, the appraising for the Holocaust, I think.

07:41.358 --> 07:41.738
Yeah, I know that.

07:41.758 --> 07:44.542
I just did all the artwork from Therese.

07:44.823 --> 07:46.365
There's a catalog of that, you know.

07:46.385 --> 07:48.267
No, this is a new collection that hasn't been seen.

07:48.287 --> 07:48.628
From where?

07:48.808 --> 07:49.549
From Therese.

07:49.569 --> 07:49.829
Really?

07:49.849 --> 07:50.470
From Therese Stock.

07:50.490 --> 07:52.993
Therese Stock, yeah.

07:53.033 --> 07:54.335
Nobody uses Therese Stock.

07:54.415 --> 07:55.797
Everybody uses Therese Stock.

07:55.817 --> 07:56.718
Therese Stock.

07:56.738 --> 07:58.120
Actually, Therese Stock.

07:59.062 --> 08:03.974
That came from a person who was the last head of the Jewish community in Berlin.

08:05.238 --> 08:06.601
What is that Dachau?

08:06.621 --> 08:10.551
That's a cuff title for an SS officer.

08:12.376 --> 08:13.358
Zyklon B.

08:13.540 --> 08:14.942
Yeah, that's one of the labels.

08:15.262 --> 08:15.823
For the cans.

08:15.843 --> 08:16.944
You know what unfortunately is?

08:17.004 --> 08:18.866
They're very easy to obtain them.

08:18.886 --> 08:21.209
The cans are almost, you know, you can buy them.

08:21.229 --> 08:22.371
They're so available.

08:22.411 --> 08:25.134
There were so many cans that were confiscated that were taken.

08:25.154 --> 08:26.556
And a lot of people used the cans for other things.

08:26.576 --> 08:27.256
Other things, yeah.

08:27.316 --> 08:28.658
And they took the labels off and all of them.

08:28.678 --> 08:31.301
Right, and so the cans, they automatically assumed they were in the camps.

08:31.321 --> 08:34.485
And when in fact a lot of them have been sold as camp artifacts and they're not.

08:34.668 --> 08:45.124
It's one of the hardest things when I'm going through the artifacts at the museum, trying to differentiate between actually camp-used artifacts versus materials that were made by the companies that were not used in the community.

08:45.144 --> 08:45.324
Right.

08:45.344 --> 08:46.746
See, like, this is from Dr. Allen.

08:46.766 --> 08:49.110
There's salt and pepper shaker holders, but they were made by the prisoners.

08:49.130 --> 08:49.330
Right.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.674
So we don't know the identity of that woman, let's just tell you.

08:51.854 --> 08:52.315
No, no.

08:52.675 --> 08:54.458
The other is very, very volatile.

08:54.518 --> 08:58.123
I mean, this shrunken head guy didn't even want to put it in the book.

08:58.644 --> 08:59.766
Now, what book are we talking about?

08:59.906 --> 09:00.707
This book over here.

09:00.727 --> 09:02.650
Why don't you think it's a crush?

09:02.883 --> 09:04.467
It was Ilsa.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.094
Yeah, that's what's her name, Ilsa.

09:07.114 --> 09:07.996
Yeah, Ilsa Kosh.

09:08.016 --> 09:08.397
Yeah.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.545
Yeah, she was the woman who was the... Shrunken Head Institute book?

09:12.347 --> 09:13.670
Dr. James Castner.

09:14.071 --> 09:17.179
Actually, the long-drawn-out story... Shrunken Head's book.

09:17.219 --> 09:20.487
Does it have a... C-A-S-T-N-E-R.

09:20.787 --> 09:25.813
came to me when I had the museum in Florida and I was up to my ears and those... Was he working with Kennedy?

09:26.254 --> 09:26.694
No, no, no.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.697
He's an entomologist.

09:28.717 --> 09:30.119
And he lives in Gainesville.

09:30.139 --> 09:30.800
And he's a professor.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.743
But he came to me and said, I know you have a collection of shrunken heads.

09:34.064 --> 09:34.825
I read about you.

09:35.025 --> 09:37.849
And he said, I want to do a book on shrunken heads.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.631
And I said, look, that is a great thing.

09:39.651 --> 09:40.752
That's something I've always wanted to do.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.175
I will help you, but I'm up to my ears with Kennedy.

09:43.215 --> 09:43.896
I can't do it now.

09:44.317 --> 09:44.857
Give me a year.

09:45.438 --> 09:46.980
He kept my number, called me.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.631
We've become great friends.

09:48.651 --> 09:57.061
He spent three days with me, made a photo studio here, and photographed all my heads, went to the Smithsonian and photographed theirs, went to Ripley's and photographed theirs, and loves mine the most.

09:58.162 --> 10:01.526
But I said to my wife, I'm going to co-author this with you.

10:01.826 --> 10:03.808
And she said, do you really want your name?

10:04.189 --> 10:05.570
At that time, I was the Kennedy guy.

10:06.031 --> 10:08.333
So she goes, do you really want your name on a shrunken head book?

10:08.514 --> 10:12.078
Because she always complained about it, and she hates shrunken head.

10:12.538 --> 10:14.881
So I said, well, she kind of talked me out of it.

10:14.921 --> 10:16.022
Plus, the guy wanted, like,

10:16.458 --> 10:20.281
10 grand, you know, up front to help him do the book.

10:20.322 --> 10:22.383
So I said, well, I don't know, I'll do whatever you want.

10:23.224 --> 10:24.005
Give me acknowledgement.

10:24.025 --> 10:27.348
I got a beautiful acknowledgement in there, and all my heads are in there, so.

10:27.368 --> 10:29.630
But actually, it is not just an art form. It's folk history.

10:29.650 --> 10:30.591
It's ethnological or something.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.318
National Geographic can do an article on this.

10:41.361 --> 10:42.301
The woman who did this, Ilse Koch.

10:46.411 --> 10:58.513
She and her husband were Gestapo officers and he was notorious.

10:59.214 --> 11:04.504
And there's a really horrific book that was written right after the war, early pocket edition, 51-52,

11:04.788 --> 11:28.737
on the brutality and the horror. It's just, it's beyond belief. It's grotesque. Yeah it's so horrific. Yeah see that's one of the things, when you go down, like when I went down in the system line where I've been looking for the areas that nobody ever sees. That is only for the appraisers and for the curatorial staff. When we go through the artifacts

11:29.628 --> 11:36.978
and you start handling the really horrible stuff, and you realize the severity of the condition.

11:37.379 --> 11:41.485
And you can even live it after you let alone survive.

11:41.565 --> 11:48.555
And it makes you think, what did you come up with when you read Primo reading, right?

11:48.575 --> 11:52.480
And you read and realize what he had to do to survive, the combination of luck.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.264
Look at that box that I had in there.

11:55.987 --> 12:04.436
One of the biggest problems with the marches from Bhutan was what they did to say they won't walk.

12:04.456 --> 12:05.057
How can they?

12:05.237 --> 12:06.518
Well, not only that.

12:06.538 --> 12:11.744
To live, they could sell somebody else.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.705
Pretty interesting.

12:13.646 --> 12:18.191
That's how you hook up with Larry.

12:19.232 --> 12:19.853
Kind of.

12:19.953 --> 12:21.775
Actually, that's probably the truth.

12:23.780 --> 12:28.498
And it all came out as a Catholicism.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.786
It was all the core of it.

12:31.289 --> 12:42.861
In this area, there are four physical collections in me of curiosity.

12:43.001 --> 12:49.248
A guy named Larry Moon, a guy named William Wayman, and his wife Carla, Bob, and myself.

12:49.829 --> 12:53.172
And I actually was more of an intermediary because I didn't collect a lot of this.

12:53.192 --> 12:57.617
My interest was in eschatology, and so I met Larry out of interest in tapas.

12:58.002 --> 12:59.785
You know, in just an artifact.

12:59.805 --> 13:05.313
There was this couple named Warren.

13:05.373 --> 13:10.041
Warren Raymond was in the Army.

13:10.602 --> 13:11.463
He came out of the Army.

13:11.483 --> 13:16.531
He had studied mortuary sciences.

13:17.412 --> 13:19.616
He did not become a mortician.

13:19.636 --> 13:23.802
He wound up working at the same time.

13:23.962 --> 13:26.406
A woman cashier takes a job.

13:26.825 --> 13:30.454
He talks chat me up one day and says, you know, what do you do for hobby?

13:30.474 --> 13:32.719
She goes, I don't tell anybody what a hobby she does for him.

13:32.740 --> 13:36.128
Because I collect cabinet photos of great children and animals.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.992
You know what I mean when you say that.

13:38.033 --> 13:39.737
So what have decorators come in?

13:39.797 --> 13:40.699
What's the odds, right?

13:40.949 --> 13:53.128
So when I'm handling the Mooney collection as an agent, Warren is all over me because he wants to get ahold of the stuff, so he invites me over the house.

13:53.148 --> 13:58.095
Now he has essentially like bombs, which he thinks it's a little earlier than this.

13:58.256 --> 14:03.704
It's more body parts and extremely cool.

14:03.784 --> 14:09.673
I don't have a problem with it, but a normal human being is going to get an agent.

14:09.653 --> 14:14.260
When Lena is born, I come back to work.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.645
I'm just running back to get a change of clothes, and I'm going to run back.

14:17.745 --> 14:19.167
They're waiting for me.

14:19.427 --> 14:21.510
Now this couple don't have kids.

14:21.530 --> 14:22.952
They have two dogs.

14:22.972 --> 14:24.795
You go into their house in their living room.

14:24.835 --> 14:28.100
They have a kids person, ours collection.

14:28.821 --> 14:30.804
And the rooms get progressively more bizarre.

14:30.824 --> 14:36.572
You get to Warren's sanctuary where you have the skulls and all the hung people, etc.

14:37.126 --> 14:42.233
I go over there one day because they want to negotiate the purchase of a dead body that I'm handing.

14:42.313 --> 14:43.234
It's a museum piece.

14:43.254 --> 14:45.637
It's a legit piece.

14:46.598 --> 14:53.548
So they're trying to show me all the oddities like I'm going to get really overwhelmed by some drinking a Coke or a Pepsi there.

14:53.868 --> 14:55.210
And they show me all this stuff.

14:55.230 --> 14:57.553
Long story short, I tell them I've got to get back.

14:58.074 --> 15:00.236
We're going to have a C-section tomorrow.

15:00.677 --> 15:01.338
I've got to get back.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.539
And so I'll talk to them afterwards.

15:02.559 --> 15:03.741
So I get back.

15:04.160 --> 15:17.400
to the store for a couple of seconds, they had been waiting for me, they had bought me a Beatrice Potter, and I'll show you what you can read from the store tomorrow, a Beatrice Potter frame of bunnies, so I could put the christening picture of Lena in there.

15:17.841 --> 15:18.522
It's on my desk.

15:18.562 --> 15:19.223
That's nice.

15:19.263 --> 15:23.088
Yeah, but the thing is, Lena, actually, where I got it from, I think you'll never want to know.

15:23.249 --> 15:25.252
Just Denny got it for you.

15:25.452 --> 15:26.934
Well, what is that piece?

15:26.974 --> 15:28.176
I'm sorry, I was missing this.

15:28.477 --> 15:30.741
No, I didn't see that.

15:30.761 --> 15:31.943
So this is my website.

15:31.963 --> 15:32.664
I just missed it.

15:32.764 --> 15:33.225
Joan of Arc.

15:33.245 --> 15:33.566
Joan of Arc.

15:33.586 --> 15:33.686
Okay.

15:33.706 --> 15:34.567
She'll be on the one over there.

15:34.607 --> 15:35.689
I have Joan of Arc stuff.

15:36.511 --> 15:36.711
Cool.

15:36.771 --> 15:37.332
Okay, you guys.

15:37.552 --> 15:39.476
And then these are mummies.

15:39.496 --> 15:49.593
Ramesses II's first cousin, exact fifth lady-in-waiting, and 3000 BC, the head of a nobleman, Egyptian, and then Inca from Peru.

15:49.613 --> 15:49.853
Wow.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.396
And these are...

15:51.629 --> 15:53.091
These are pretty wild.

15:53.531 --> 15:56.675
Did that come out of the Royal Repository, the one that they shined up on there?

15:56.695 --> 15:57.336
No, no, no.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.877
No, I got the years ago.

15:59.418 --> 16:02.281
No, I'm talking about they made a big discovery in 1880.

16:02.482 --> 16:03.363
Oh, no.

16:03.583 --> 16:03.983
I don't know.

16:04.003 --> 16:05.285
This came from the Cotter Museum.

16:05.325 --> 16:06.786
This one and this one.

16:07.307 --> 16:09.009
I got this one when I was 16.

16:09.149 --> 16:09.470
Really?

16:09.490 --> 16:10.551
And look at the hair.

16:10.671 --> 16:12.793
It's still a classic curl.

16:13.114 --> 16:13.334
Yeah.

16:14.215 --> 16:15.977
This guy has a goatee and everything going.

16:16.738 --> 16:18.320
Yeah, this.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.581
It's all curl for life.

16:20.142 --> 16:21.163
Look at that.

16:22.493 --> 16:27.721
And so this is where you watch television up here?

16:27.741 --> 16:28.021
Yes, I do.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.185
Surrounded by these frames.

16:31.527 --> 16:34.791
Look at the skull of the glass.

16:34.912 --> 16:35.132
I know.

16:35.653 --> 16:48.312
Yeah, I'm going to keep my glasses on.

16:48.332 --> 16:48.552
Go ahead.

16:55.163 --> 17:04.152
Oh, that's what we do with the other one?

17:04.252 --> 17:05.013
Yeah.

17:05.954 --> 17:07.996
So, Bob, tell us a bit about where we are now.

17:08.016 --> 17:18.346
We're in my basement of my home, and my collection I just got back last week, and I'm apologizing for the way it looks, but it's not a finished basement.

17:18.366 --> 17:21.349
My wife wants to go to theaters and all this stuff down here, but this is the way we got it.

17:21.949 --> 17:24.732
And this is the only place I have to store it up, because

17:24.965 --> 17:27.469
Honestly, I could get a storage area, but it's here.

17:27.509 --> 17:28.190
I can work for it.

17:28.210 --> 17:28.610
It's safe.

17:28.851 --> 17:29.612
It's in my home.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.034
And here it is.

17:31.194 --> 17:41.028
It's just looking at 50,000 to 60,000 pieces of Kennedy that I collected from age 8 to last week.

17:41.869 --> 17:43.352
And where had it been prior to coming here?

17:43.692 --> 17:44.854
The Florida International Museum.

17:45.054 --> 17:45.935
Smithsonian affiliate.

17:46.476 --> 17:46.857
I see.

17:46.877 --> 17:51.343
I mean, any collector in the country that I know, and in the world, actually, that started age 8.

17:51.627 --> 18:01.823
collected my whole life, and ended up with a Smithsonian-affiliated museum, 27,000 square foot, approved by the Smithsonian, sanctioned by the Smithsonian, and put up by the state of Florida.

18:01.923 --> 18:03.145
It was on run for five years.

18:03.606 --> 18:12.520
I loaned my collection for 125,000 a year, which is not bad.

18:13.461 --> 18:14.443
It's everywhere here.

18:16.145 --> 18:19.170
The boxes, the gray boxes are

18:20.011 --> 18:22.574
segregated because this was my travel exhibit.

18:22.635 --> 18:32.428
We traveled last year in Dallas, where we had 240,000 people go through in 24 days at the Hall of State at the Dallas State Fair.

18:32.949 --> 18:38.536
We did a Tropicana in Atlantic City for three months, and we did the opening at Opryland in Nashville.

18:38.556 --> 18:40.179
And these are 15,000 square foot.

18:40.199 --> 18:41.460
I got pictures of all of it.

18:41.801 --> 18:45.746
And how many items did you have in these?

18:45.966 --> 18:46.407
I had 600.

18:46.927 --> 18:54.175
in these boxes, displayed in a museum setting with hard walls, oval office, a traveling seven tractor trailer.

18:54.195 --> 18:56.297
So tell me some of the dazzlers that we've got here.

18:57.118 --> 19:01.723
Well, this is the inventory of just the travel exhibit.

19:02.584 --> 19:06.989
You can open it anywhere and see what I have, pens that things get owned.

19:07.009 --> 19:11.294
I've got, we had it segregated from the campaign which made him his presidency.

19:11.314 --> 19:16.900
Then we went from the early years to political beginnings, the inaugural, the West Wing, which is

19:17.133 --> 19:24.703
going to the White House, family life in the White House, Oval Office, Evelyn Lincoln, my mentor and friend for years, her material.

19:25.344 --> 19:31.331
On the road is his travels, domestic affairs is what he did in the U.S., his assassination, and then his legacy.

19:31.492 --> 19:32.613
So it's 12 sections.

19:32.873 --> 19:34.035
It's 12 galleries.

19:34.075 --> 19:34.736
12 galleries.

19:34.776 --> 19:35.477
Right.

19:35.597 --> 19:41.585
Is it largely an artifactual collection, or is it... It's archival and artifacts.

19:41.685 --> 19:43.427
I have the baby christening ring.

19:44.200 --> 20:13.093
down to uh the flags on the car in Dallas the day he was killed. A to z there's not a period you can't name without John F. Kennedy on it. That's the way I collected. PT 109. Yeah I got I met all the crew. I just went to the two females uh the last crew member and Robert Donovan. The family invited me. I was the only representative of any Kennedy type person. I was the only person with a camera taking pictures at both funerals. Uh Gerald Zinger who was the machinist mate, they invited me and I gave him a private tour of the museum in Florida.

20:13.327 --> 20:14.548
He had Alzheimer's.

20:14.568 --> 20:19.352
I gave him a private tour about a year and a half before he died with his family.

20:20.073 --> 20:32.304
And the biggest misnomer about my collection is that Evelyn Lincoln handed me everything, which is totally wrong because it's a detriment not only to her, but everybody else that helped me along the way.

20:33.125 --> 20:36.088
But I've gotten, I've driven to Pittsburgh for one piece.

20:36.989 --> 20:40.752
I've driven to Pennsylvania to fill my explored place back and forth.

20:41.339 --> 20:48.229
I've gone literally to flea markets, everywhere, buying anything Kennedy since I was 14.

20:49.070 --> 21:00.787
What would you say is the... I hate to get into the area of rarity, but would you say... The majority... The most historically important thing... Yeah, 12 rocking chairs.

21:01.268 --> 21:05.254
This is the rocking chair right here that he's sitting with John Glenn, right here.

21:05.487 --> 21:06.288
And that's that rock.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.028
Tomorrow.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.051
And this was, you know, you're old enough to remember.

21:10.071 --> 21:11.412
It's an icon symbol, the 60s.

21:11.512 --> 21:13.234
I'm old enough.

21:13.895 --> 21:17.418
I was barely just too young to vote for him.

21:17.438 --> 21:19.179
I bought it for LBJ in 64.

21:19.199 --> 21:25.025
Just have a little to the left so I can also have the... Oh, just a little bit to the left so I can get the 50s.

21:25.625 --> 21:26.446
The chair itself.

21:26.466 --> 21:27.007
Yeah, that's good.

21:28.468 --> 21:29.169
Mr. Lee.

21:29.189 --> 21:29.909
Okay, that's good.

21:29.929 --> 21:31.671
This was a major item of the museum.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.093
But I also have his first rocking chair, that's in 55.

21:34.343 --> 21:36.425
How did these fall out of possession of the family?

21:36.445 --> 21:38.066
Well, this was in Evelyn Lincoln's office.

21:38.086 --> 21:45.332
And, you know, back then when he was killed, this stuff went to the, scattered to the winds everywhere.

21:45.352 --> 21:46.613
Jackie gave away a lot of stuff.

21:47.534 --> 21:50.116
Jackie gave his valet a rocker.

21:50.597 --> 21:51.678
He had 12 rockers made.

21:51.918 --> 21:53.699
There's many, many, many stories about his rockers.

21:53.719 --> 21:54.960
He had 12 rockers.

21:55.061 --> 21:57.803
But it's so different from the rockers my wife has at the house.

21:58.844 --> 22:03.928
This is covered with the first material of his first rocker that I got permission from Jackie Kennedy to have.

22:04.297 --> 22:08.344
This is Lyndon Johnson's rocker that he used in the White House afterwards.

22:08.364 --> 22:09.566
He has a bolster on the back.

22:10.267 --> 22:12.491
I mean, we can just look in any one of these.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.794
14 rockers.

22:13.994 --> 22:15.777
There's programs signed by Khrushchev.

22:17.380 --> 22:21.247
Here's signatures by Kennedy.

22:23.851 --> 22:27.798
I know what's in each one of these, but I'd have to look them up to tell you.

22:27.818 --> 22:28.920
But this is the christening ring.

22:29.575 --> 22:32.599
This is the ring that he was on his finger when he was a baby.

22:32.639 --> 22:34.621
How did that fall out of the possession of the family?

22:34.641 --> 22:42.411
This was given to Mary Moore, a gift of the Kennedy's neighbor and friend Mary Moore.

22:42.431 --> 22:44.534
She was the godmother.

22:45.034 --> 22:45.215
Okay.

22:45.475 --> 22:46.276
On top of the sign.

22:46.336 --> 22:50.561
You might not be able to get it.

22:50.621 --> 22:58.491
I got permission from Rose to have this off the negative.

22:58.511 --> 22:58.992
Wow.

22:59.225 --> 23:03.030
Look at that.

23:03.110 --> 23:14.265
People, that's a favorite.

23:14.285 --> 23:23.016
And you have to realize that in the Brookline home, in the Brookline home, Rose saved everything of all the kids.

23:23.958 --> 23:26.020
So nothing exists for these babies.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.342
You can't get anything.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.434
It's all in the files of the Kennedy Library, these negatives.

23:30.914 --> 23:31.996
That's off the original negative.

23:32.777 --> 23:34.919
And baby stuff is just not around.

23:34.939 --> 23:36.942
It's all in that house under, you know.

23:37.222 --> 23:39.786
I'll be darned.

23:39.806 --> 23:46.995
Of the things that you have in your collection, how much does the Kennedy Library have?

23:47.596 --> 23:48.617
That's similar.

23:48.637 --> 23:49.238
Do they have?

23:50.019 --> 23:51.100
Silver or is it gold?

23:51.241 --> 23:52.102
Oh, no.

23:52.202 --> 23:55.887
That was the big thing is they wanted a lot of the stuff that I have, but it's mine.

23:56.387 --> 23:57.008
What's the metal?

23:57.443 --> 23:58.304
It's cold.

23:58.324 --> 23:59.065
It's cold.

23:59.845 --> 24:02.308
Rose had it made, gave it to Mary.

24:02.428 --> 24:04.510
I mean, Mary Moore had it made, gave it to Rose and the baby.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.331
The baby outgrew it.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.553
Rose gave it back to Mary Moore.

24:08.113 --> 24:12.798
And Mary Moore's husband was Joe Kennedy's secretary a long time.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.580
Eddie Moore, famous guy.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.883
So Mary was just a next door neighbor and was friendly with all the kids.

24:17.903 --> 24:19.444
And they came over and played with her and all.

24:19.604 --> 24:23.248
But she kept it around her neck for years as a keepsake.

24:23.431 --> 24:26.997
Just as Jack was sickly and a favorite kid at first.

24:27.017 --> 24:30.363
She was the godmother.

24:31.425 --> 24:35.852
But anyway, let me see what else we have.

24:37.395 --> 24:42.444
I mean, I have their passports, which are stunning.

24:42.464 --> 24:44.147
Oh, yeah, they're stunning.

24:45.349 --> 24:47.312
I don't know which one it's in.

24:48.878 --> 24:55.065
I have to believe that the Kennedy Library people have made multiple inquiries.

24:55.866 --> 25:02.153
They came to my mother's house in 96, Riggs and Johnson, the curator.

25:03.215 --> 25:07.199
They came down and just lost their lunch.

25:08.260 --> 25:09.161
They had all this stuff.

25:10.923 --> 25:13.206
What kinds of things do they have in comparison?

25:13.607 --> 25:14.688
Same type of thing.

25:14.708 --> 25:15.789
It's the National Archives.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.451
They do more research things.

25:17.718 --> 25:27.992
But come on back here, what you fail to see is all of this material, which is not inventory, that is a ton of great stuff.

25:29.393 --> 25:43.152
Like, for instance, I have a basic inventory, but in here are all these files of Edel and Lincoln, which is just crammed with documents and letters and wonderful stuff.

25:43.232 --> 25:47.117
Notes, like you just pulled out something from Hebert Humphrey to Edel and Lincoln.

25:47.958 --> 25:56.470
I spent 18 months working in the museum to put out an exhibit.

25:57.812 --> 26:00.015
I didn't spend time with this.

26:00.115 --> 26:00.877
I didn't get a chance.

26:00.937 --> 26:04.161
I know what's here, but all this is Evelyn Lincoln's stuff.

26:04.181 --> 26:08.948
If you think Herbie and Mary Gallagher had stuff, Evelyn Lincoln had stuff.

26:09.469 --> 26:12.413
No comparison.

26:13.237 --> 26:18.004
I have this listed, but it's very, very, very interesting.

26:18.024 --> 26:20.828
But there's no way to know how the follow-up of that.

26:21.129 --> 26:24.534
No, well, unless it's got papers with it.

26:25.015 --> 26:26.597
But these are, Evel Lincoln kept her files.

26:26.617 --> 26:28.620
I have pictures of her working on her files.

26:29.602 --> 26:32.186
But each box is categorized.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.247
And there's kitsch stuff.

26:33.427 --> 26:36.913
This is all the little kitschy things which people that collect Kennedy would have.

26:36.993 --> 26:38.335
Buttons, pins, badges.

26:38.575 --> 26:38.896
Sure.

26:39.436 --> 26:42.501
Magazines have got tons and tons of, you know,

26:42.987 --> 26:44.772
Anything you want in magazines.

26:46.157 --> 26:46.919
Warren commissions.

26:47.220 --> 26:50.470
How did you become friendly with this?

26:50.670 --> 26:55.826
I wrote in the White House in 63.

26:55.846 --> 26:56.889
So while she was in the White House.

26:56.989 --> 26:57.250
Oh, yeah.

27:10.645 --> 27:11.867
I should have a copy of that.

27:12.027 --> 27:14.651
That's okay, but would you say that's the heart, the core of the collection?

27:15.012 --> 27:15.673
What?

27:15.693 --> 27:18.096
The Lincoln stuff, or is most of the stuff reduced?

27:18.116 --> 27:24.146
The best stuff is Evelyn Lincoln's, but there are things that I got that are just equally as great.

27:24.186 --> 27:28.873
It didn't come from her, but yeah, there's great stuff.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.397
I have... Now, did she sell this to you or give it to you?

27:41.417 --> 27:43.059
No, she gave it to me.

27:43.079 --> 27:51.171
I saw her... What in her mind was the... I always thought I was going to have a museum, and she wanted me to carry one as a legacy to her.

27:51.251 --> 27:54.255
But she didn't know that there was a Kennedy Library in Boston?

27:54.415 --> 27:55.737
She gave tons of stuff to Kennedy Library.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.198
Oh, yeah.

27:56.418 --> 27:58.761
In fact, I had letters from JFK Jr.

27:58.781 --> 28:02.206
in 92 saying, Mrs. Lincoln, we know you got all this great stuff from my dad.

28:03.268 --> 28:04.029
You were close to him.

28:04.249 --> 28:05.070
We were close to you.

28:05.270 --> 28:06.051
give her some stuff.

28:06.071 --> 28:09.155
She felt sorry for him, she sent him two file cabinets up there.

28:09.175 --> 28:16.785
But this stuff, she loved and she willed me, along with the Kennedy Library in 1995 when she died, a significant portion of her collection along with that marker.

28:18.967 --> 28:21.070
This is Elize Palace.

28:21.190 --> 28:23.113
I have like 10 or 12 of these.

28:23.253 --> 28:25.415
I have all the first ones.

28:25.435 --> 28:26.857
These were done by the CIA.

28:26.877 --> 28:30.602
You sold some of the sales, but these were the ones that were scored.

28:30.970 --> 28:55.628
didn't get cut. Right. She stopped it yeah and what I did is I talked about the prayer cards, and made these up and I was going to sell them but I never did and these are two original front and back, but I have all the remainders of uh. Those are prayer cards. Yeah from somewhere from his funeral. Jackie didn't like this. She said forget it, so they went with this one. Yeah this is the only picture in existence of the original. He only wanted him wearing glasses in there.

28:55.912 --> 28:56.653
Look at that.

28:56.673 --> 29:01.520
Even Cecil Stoughton who took it when he saw it, he went, you know the library doesn't have that?

29:01.921 --> 29:03.443
There's a number on the back of this photograph.

29:03.463 --> 29:06.207
If you look in the files of the library and go in, write them down, numbers.

29:07.209 --> 29:10.153
Because Stoughton took pictures on a day, on any given day.

29:10.894 --> 29:13.158
The next day he filed them in a file cabinet.

29:13.178 --> 29:14.480
That's how he kept his file going.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.883
And then one day became two, became three, a thousand days.

29:17.785 --> 29:22.071
So this photograph, when they saw that he had glasses on,

29:22.574 --> 29:24.457
Kennedy didn't even know he snapped it.

29:24.478 --> 29:25.439
He said, get rid of it.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.541
So he destroyed the negative.

29:26.561 --> 29:28.265
So the negative doesn't exist then?

29:28.285 --> 29:28.505
No.

29:28.525 --> 29:30.769
If you look in the Kennedy library, there's a number missing.

29:30.849 --> 29:32.172
That's the only print of that?

29:32.192 --> 29:33.274
That's the only print of it.

29:33.294 --> 29:35.678
He's reading flea powder for the dog.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.083
I'll be down.

29:38.103 --> 29:40.988
Look at that.

29:42.048 --> 29:54.084
And I've actually, in my collection somewhere, I have that published in the newspaper.

29:54.104 --> 29:54.905
You see it in the paper.

29:56.387 --> 29:58.490
I've never seen him with glasses before.

29:58.831 --> 29:59.031
Yeah.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.054
I have one of him as senator with the glasses.

30:01.074 --> 30:03.437
I have his glasses.

30:03.457 --> 30:05.239
I have two pairs of his glasses as president.

30:05.379 --> 30:07.062
And there's a woman in the picture?

30:07.342 --> 30:08.483
That's everyone.

30:09.505 --> 30:11.127
That's John Jr.

30:11.292 --> 30:12.553
I have a bunch of books.

30:13.795 --> 30:20.201
Mrs. Lincoln gave me letters on everything that I have also, plus all her correspondence with me.

30:20.241 --> 30:25.066
That's the last picture of them in the Oval Office two days before Dallas with her cousin.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.228
Two days before Dallas.

30:27.909 --> 30:32.313
And then I had her sign stuff, like this picture right here of Kennedy that hung in the Senate office.

30:32.374 --> 30:33.014
I have that one.

30:34.976 --> 30:38.700
I believe, if I'm not mistaken, I saw it the other day.

30:41.110 --> 30:43.233
So how old were you in 63 when you wrote her?

30:44.615 --> 30:47.599
I was 13.

30:47.699 --> 30:51.765
So she was responding to a kid, a teenage boy.

30:52.727 --> 30:52.907
Oh, yeah.

30:52.927 --> 30:54.890
That's the one from Life magazine.

30:55.030 --> 30:59.957
And all these magazines would send him stuff like that to get close to him.

31:00.418 --> 31:05.705
I have all of these over here are original photographs.

31:05.725 --> 31:08.149
There's thousands of them.

31:09.471 --> 31:10.392
Her and I together.

31:11.587 --> 31:19.536
Kennedy, birthday party, and these are all letters to my wife and cards and this thing.

31:19.556 --> 31:27.985
Here she's, she loaned me that picture, and I took a picture of it, and she's telling me to give it back to her because it's so rare.

31:29.407 --> 31:29.687
Look at that.

31:29.707 --> 31:38.517
And then, this is just one book.

31:38.537 --> 31:39.518
This is another book, Swift.

31:40.696 --> 31:44.703
I photographed each item, and Jimmy Pearsall gave him this.

31:44.723 --> 31:45.444
Jimmy Pearsall.

31:45.464 --> 31:46.345
Yep.

31:46.365 --> 31:50.532
And each item has letters with it, a photograph, and a letter of documentation.

31:51.254 --> 31:51.434
Mm-hmm.

31:51.454 --> 31:53.858
Plus, here, you got this one.

31:53.918 --> 31:55.901
That's very insightful, both of you.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.045
So it's April 5th, 1989.

31:58.065 --> 32:02.873
Dear Robert, I've been a collector of memorabilia most of my life and due to my relationship with important people.

32:03.730 --> 32:08.636
I've been fortunate to collect, and this is with an Emanuel typewriter, by the way, in 1989.

32:09.017 --> 32:12.802
That's not an electric typewriter.

32:13.923 --> 32:17.248
Most of the items I've collected have either been given to me or have been discarded.

32:17.268 --> 32:21.654
The collection which I have made available to you is the John F. Kennedy collection, which I started in the early 1950s.

32:22.495 --> 32:25.679
Many of these personal items have been saved from extinction by me.

32:25.859 --> 32:27.641
Many items were given to me by John F. Kennedy.

32:27.762 --> 32:30.345
Others were discarded items, even from the wastebasket.

32:30.899 --> 32:37.008
Soon after, Mrs. Kennedy moved out of the White House in 1964 to the Avril Harrowman home on Oak Street in Georgetown.

32:37.028 --> 32:54.853
She filled an entire roof with castoffs, dresses, yard goods, all kinds of clothing belonging to the president, herself and her children, et cetera, were piled high on long tables in several boxes and wicker baskets lining the walls where castoff jewelry, memorabilia, gifts, trinkets, and items obtained over the years.

32:54.913 --> 32:57.717
Mrs. Kennedy invited me, among the first of many of her friends,

32:58.152 --> 32:59.354
to come to that room and choose anything I wanted from the entire room.

33:00.275 --> 33:26.252
This I did, and I must say that I carried away many, many very personal items. I have only given you necessary letters of authenticity to accompany each item I have made available to you. I am sending this letter to you to be added to your collection for future generations. Sincerely, Evelyn Lincoln, Personal Secretary to our late President John F. Kennedy. And it's addressed to Robert L. White in Bloomsbury, Baltimore, Maryland, 2122.

33:27.008 --> 33:47.346
I guess that makes it pretty clear doesn't it huh? That's that's the letter of transmittal. Okay that's great yeah that's great. Yes. I don't want to break it. Okay yeah. I asked Mrs. lincoln in 89, I said you know when I'm dead and you're dead

33:48.220 --> 33:50.242
Somebody's going to say, why did you have this?

33:50.282 --> 33:50.823
She told me.

33:51.043 --> 33:52.144
I said, could you write me a letter?

33:52.165 --> 33:54.788
And I never said to her, I didn't put words in her mouth.

33:54.808 --> 33:55.809
I said, you write it.

33:55.849 --> 33:57.050
So that's a great letter.

33:58.051 --> 33:58.131
Wow.

33:58.151 --> 33:59.553
Who was her next of kin?

33:59.573 --> 34:00.514
I mean, she had a husband.

34:00.534 --> 34:02.536
Her husband died 40 days after her.

34:02.556 --> 34:04.919
And so he was all obviously in sync with all this.

34:05.079 --> 34:06.161
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:06.201 --> 34:07.262
We were great.

34:07.302 --> 34:08.103
We were great friends.

34:08.844 --> 34:09.605
Did they have children?

34:10.826 --> 34:15.832
All the items with the lead letters.

34:16.052 --> 34:16.152
Yeah.

34:16.503 --> 34:18.405
Mass 61 H5757.

34:18.485 --> 34:24.149
I even had his lunch tray that he ate lunch off of.

34:25.871 --> 34:27.472
It's a bit overwhelming, isn't it?

34:27.492 --> 34:35.639
Oh, it's interesting stuff.

34:35.659 --> 34:35.759
Yeah.

34:35.779 --> 34:46.408
And what I was getting at with this stuff is... Dad had her sign, but there she is, right here, and with Ted and Peter Walker and all of them at the piano.

34:46.658 --> 34:50.184
And there's been tons of articles about this kind of stuff, you know.

34:50.204 --> 34:52.127
This is from Saturday Evening Post.

34:52.147 --> 34:55.012
You know about the doodles, right?

34:55.293 --> 34:55.413
No.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.637
His secretary even saved the doodles.

34:57.797 --> 35:02.325
Her and I, I could do a book on his doodles.

35:02.345 --> 35:03.187
I know more about his doodles.

35:03.207 --> 35:04.549
This is Evelyn N. Lincoln, JFK.

35:04.569 --> 35:09.257
The secretary during the Senate and the White House even saved the doodles when she cleaned out his desk.

35:10.216 --> 35:11.719
She kept the file for each day.

35:11.739 --> 35:12.981
He was in office.

35:13.001 --> 35:17.028
The valet George Thomas gave her the scrivensy file when he put away the president's clothes.

35:17.990 --> 35:18.872
Compulsive doodle.

35:18.892 --> 35:22.759
Kennedy usually wrote down the topic under discussion, then drew boxes around the names in Cuba.

35:22.779 --> 35:24.161
So did you get most of the doodles?

35:24.762 --> 35:25.984
I've got a lot of them.

35:26.025 --> 35:29.591
She made books for the Kennedy Library, but I got a lot of doodles.

35:29.631 --> 35:31.855
I have him drawing an atomic bomb.

35:32.937 --> 35:34.620
I have him blockading Cuba.

35:34.904 --> 35:37.089
where he's blocking Fidel Castro and all that.

35:37.550 --> 35:38.853
This is an EP sound.

35:38.953 --> 35:39.995
I never showed this to anybody.

35:40.356 --> 35:43.322
This is Mrs. Lincoln in 68, waiting to JFK in heaven.

35:45.006 --> 35:47.251
She was like... Did she start losing it?

35:47.271 --> 35:47.953
No, she didn't lose it.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.536
This is in her hand.

35:49.556 --> 35:50.398
This is handwritten.

35:50.498 --> 35:52.002
It's pretty strange.

35:53.024 --> 35:53.605
Is it dated?

35:54.125 --> 35:57.550
No, but she says it's been five years now since your death.

35:57.570 --> 36:06.044
Well, my dear Mr. President, it has been over six years, so it's 69 since you left us.

36:07.105 --> 36:13.696
And although time has passed rather swiftly, I wanted you to know how very much you have been missed here on Earth.

36:14.978 --> 36:21.668
It seemed only yesterday that you were coming out to my office looking for a mail memoranda and reminders I kept on the

36:22.441 --> 36:51.199
corners of my desk. These were interesting days filled with joy and happiness. I miss them, miss them, very much. In fact I have a feeling that the whole world misses them, and then there was Dallas, looking back over those grim dark hours that followed the long wait in the hospital before they released your body, heaven forbid, the use of that word. The last ride with you in air force one

36:51.533 --> 36:55.638
the plane you designed and loved, and then the vigil.

36:56.119 --> 36:58.562
Oh, I can't get the rest of it.

36:58.582 --> 37:02.487
Just, uh, that's cheap.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.592
Anyway, I just want to read the final sheet.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.837
The vigil at the Bethesda Medical Hospital all seemed like a nightmare.

37:11.017 --> 37:15.503
I will never forget the very next morning after that horrible day in Dallas.

37:15.583 --> 37:21.270
It was so sad to see the new red carpeting in your office.

37:21.520 --> 37:25.184
and mine that had been laid during our absence.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.825
It was to be a surprise for you.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.189
Instead, I was the one who was surprised.

37:30.669 --> 37:40.079
Because shortly after I arrived in my office, a new president came in somewhere around 8.30 a.m., said he would like to see me in his office.

37:40.099 --> 37:45.064
His office, I thought, there must be a mistake.

37:45.124 --> 37:46.806
Only yesterday it was yours.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.148
Neverland, he was saying, I need you

37:49.583 --> 38:15.118
more than you need me. Do you think you could have your things moved out of your office by nine? I have an appointment in this office at 9:30, and I would like to move my girls in at nine o'clock. It wasn't important what I said. All I could think of was the many days weeks and years that had been since together since us together since

38:16.246 --> 38:23.497
taken us to gather together all of the things that... All right, Bob, here's a very... Isn't that interesting?

38:23.517 --> 38:24.458
Yeah, it's really something.

38:24.478 --> 38:32.510
Bob, I spent a day at that desk, that table outside of my office, mixing and matching the collateral stuff, all the garbage, and taking pictures and going, okay, this looks good with this.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.713
I'll remove this Jackie picture, you know.

38:34.773 --> 38:36.575
Right, right, right.

38:36.595 --> 38:37.236
Isn't that neat?

38:37.337 --> 38:38.418
That's something, yeah.

38:38.438 --> 38:39.259
That's something.

38:39.279 --> 38:40.241
I've never seen anybody that.

38:40.922 --> 38:43.305
Did she use that material in her book?

38:44.026 --> 38:45.168
No.

38:45.188 --> 38:45.408
She didn't.

38:45.889 --> 38:45.949
No.

38:46.385 --> 38:51.491
That's a very important document.

38:51.511 --> 38:55.216
No matter what you see, you're going to say yes.

38:55.236 --> 39:03.065
When you try to put it in perspective, it's almost impossible.

39:03.245 --> 39:05.948
Well, some of the things are clearly minutiae.

39:06.028 --> 39:09.533
For whatever reason, I have them all.

39:09.813 --> 39:15.700
I mean, I have to put it in perspective.

39:15.983 --> 39:18.486
of some importance, you lose it.

39:18.506 --> 39:21.991
You lose the whole structure.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.515
Unless you see it as intelligent.

39:24.575 --> 39:28.260
Well, it's the material objects of an important 20th century life.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.261
Exactly.

39:29.341 --> 39:32.325
And the material artifact is the in thing today, isn't it?

39:32.345 --> 39:33.948
Yeah, just to get your point of reference.

39:33.968 --> 39:34.689
I remember that, Nick.

39:34.929 --> 39:37.613
I was picking up, keep your tape on it.

39:37.673 --> 39:42.379
I was doing Helen Susser, who was the most female executive.

39:42.359 --> 39:55.763
She takes over tomorrow when Laurel goes over to Europe and she gets a postcard from Bill Shire from Berlin, December 9, 1939.

39:55.823 --> 39:58.848
Say, Helen, how are you doing?

39:58.869 --> 39:59.991
We miss you over here.

40:00.151 --> 40:01.954
Ed, send us regards.

40:02.373 --> 40:08.705
You know, when are you going to become a war correspondent, and then, I hate it here, signed Bill.

40:08.925 --> 40:10.608
How much is that worth?

40:11.129 --> 40:13.774
A hundred dollars, two hundred dollars.

40:13.794 --> 40:22.390
But when you take a Bill Shire close correspondence, and you put these in a relationship with all the churns, and you see with Ed, I mean, now this is a whole new world.

40:22.370 --> 40:30.584
You know, they were responsible, Edmond and Bill Shire, for the first broadcast of news, of international news.

40:30.624 --> 40:33.890
They had never done it before, and they did it on December 10th.

40:34.431 --> 40:44.007
So this was the day before the international broadcast of the war that they knew together from one day, which acknowledges the first broadcast

40:43.987 --> 40:51.580
It's like I have a custom.

40:52.321 --> 41:04.322
But the one book I've not read, I wouldn't sell it to him.

41:04.382 --> 41:06.045
I just don't want to sell it.

41:06.228 --> 41:16.244
Then when we did the Kennedy auction, he was an expert, he's a civilian, he doesn't buy, he's selling, he belongs to the UAC, he collected the autograph card, and he's the regional president.

41:16.504 --> 41:21.893
So I asked him to come in to overlook my appraiser and tell me what was authentic and what wasn't.

41:22.113 --> 41:31.067
I didn't tell him what I said was real and what wasn't, but he went every item that was exactly where I was, what was authentic, he said was authentic, what I thought wasn't authentic, wasn't.

41:31.328 --> 41:32.910
I do the same thing with Bob.

41:32.890 --> 41:35.412
So I said, what do I owe you for yourself?

41:35.492 --> 41:37.174
And he goes, you know that letter from Johnson?

41:37.374 --> 41:37.935
Give me a price.

41:38.535 --> 41:40.958
So I said, okay, you can have it for $250 or $350.

41:41.538 --> 41:42.799
Whatever.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.561
And he jumped, he went to check.

41:44.581 --> 41:45.862
He goes, Alan, you know what this letter is?

41:45.922 --> 41:50.066
I said, well, it's the last letter he wrote before he had a heart attack and all that.

41:50.947 --> 41:52.228
I told you, it was after you made the deal.

41:52.248 --> 41:52.428
Yeah.

41:52.568 --> 41:54.150
He goes, hey, look at the date.

41:54.170 --> 41:55.491
I said, that's what the date.

41:55.511 --> 41:56.332
I said, okay, I do.

41:56.352 --> 41:58.174
He goes, but look, he even timed it.

41:58.434 --> 42:00.015
He had a heart attack at 1148.

42:00.035 --> 42:01.817
This is timed 1191.

42:01.797 --> 42:06.528
This guy's an expert in that minutia.

42:06.688 --> 42:08.552
But that's what we tell people.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.697
Know your subject better than anyone else.

42:10.817 --> 42:13.022
And I want to break, you know what?

42:13.103 --> 42:17.109
I see my opportunities, and I see them.

42:17.170 --> 42:17.670
I don't care.

42:17.891 --> 42:21.897
You know, because you just told me it was something, and you did it as a friendship.

42:21.917 --> 42:26.144
Now, if you were setting me up to buy this letter and doing it, then I'd be upset.

42:26.184 --> 42:28.929
And I looked at him, and he goes, ah.

42:29.389 --> 42:32.935
Then again, when I got the material from

42:32.915 --> 42:34.396
Yeah, you can have it.

42:34.456 --> 42:34.737
Okay.

42:34.897 --> 42:36.578
I said, well, you won't have it with Alan.

42:36.598 --> 42:37.179
He's an expert.

42:37.419 --> 42:40.642
So, Bob and I wrote down the prices of what we thought he should be able to afford.

42:40.762 --> 42:41.963
And then we turned over the cards.

42:42.103 --> 42:43.104
Anyway, yeah.

42:43.524 --> 42:44.865
I'm sorry, Alan.

42:44.905 --> 42:46.106
No, it's fine.

42:46.306 --> 42:47.988
That's a basic inventory.

42:48.528 --> 42:49.569
Remember, I told you I'd get you all.

42:49.669 --> 42:50.270
The basic inventory.

42:50.290 --> 42:51.251
The basic inventory.

42:51.271 --> 42:51.991
Yeah.

42:52.011 --> 42:52.291
Okay.

42:52.692 --> 42:53.793
All right.

42:54.373 --> 42:55.554
Let me show you this.

42:56.935 --> 42:58.056
That's a basic inventory.

42:58.537 --> 42:59.177
You can read this.

42:59.197 --> 42:59.598
Yeah, okay.

42:59.658 --> 43:00.799
Okay, this is my travel exhibit.

43:02.320 --> 43:02.500
Uh.

43:03.053 --> 43:06.097
Political beginnings is Gallery 3.

43:07.278 --> 43:10.222
So I go to Gallery 3, and I see which case.

43:11.804 --> 43:13.606
Okay, JFK and Jackie's Passports.

43:13.626 --> 43:16.149
It's Gallery 3, Case 18.

43:17.111 --> 43:22.017
Then I go here, and I go to Gallery 3, Case 18.

43:22.037 --> 43:22.457
Miracle.

43:22.938 --> 43:23.839
Well, this is pretty good.

43:23.859 --> 43:25.080
So you're pretty well organized.

43:25.101 --> 43:26.943
Well, I'm organized pretty well.

43:26.963 --> 43:30.327
How do you start this job?

43:31.876 --> 43:33.538
Well, Alan.

43:33.998 --> 43:34.659
No, no, no.

43:34.939 --> 43:37.862
Why don't you open them both?

43:38.102 --> 43:40.064
Well, you got the passport.

43:40.084 --> 43:40.505
Yeah.

43:40.545 --> 43:46.430
Now, the JFK one is his first trip to Vietnam on a fact-finding tour all over Asia.

43:46.651 --> 43:52.797
This is when she's in Southampton attending the coronation of the Queen and cables him to marry her.

43:54.178 --> 43:55.800
Cables him to marry her.

43:56.020 --> 43:58.402
No, it's a lot.

43:58.422 --> 43:59.183
There it is.

44:00.209 --> 44:01.551
And you see the purple stamp right here?

44:01.571 --> 44:02.412
That's Southampton.

44:02.432 --> 44:03.393
She's in Southampton.

44:03.413 --> 44:05.576
So that's when he goes and meets Lansdale.

44:05.596 --> 44:06.477
Oh, this is this one.

44:06.497 --> 44:07.439
Is that the one of 53, 54?

44:07.459 --> 44:08.000
Yeah.

44:08.260 --> 44:10.443
Yeah, that's the one he meets Lansdale.

44:10.583 --> 44:11.604
Okay, we've just come out.

44:11.664 --> 44:12.125
Burma.

44:12.345 --> 44:15.009
Yeah, he had just come out of the Philippines.

44:15.329 --> 44:15.610
Vietnam.

44:15.630 --> 44:17.012
Oh, yeah.

44:17.032 --> 44:22.159
You see, I love getting history books, and they say, at certain certain dates, he's somewhere, and I'm going, no, he's not.

44:22.179 --> 44:22.980
And I know where he is.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.643
But you see, that's a very important historical artifact.

44:25.663 --> 44:26.925
Sure, yeah.

44:27.631 --> 44:29.254
Do you know where the landfill is?

44:29.274 --> 44:29.515
Oh, my gosh.

44:29.855 --> 44:32.480
So just these passports and do you have other passports?

44:32.500 --> 44:34.223
They look like a baby.

44:34.263 --> 44:36.989
They're five years earlier in the life before they got married.

44:37.189 --> 44:38.411
In fact, hers is amended.

44:38.491 --> 44:40.154
It's issued to Jacqueline Bouvier.

44:40.174 --> 44:40.715
He's 31.

44:40.756 --> 44:42.098
He's 33 years old.

44:42.158 --> 44:45.785
It's issued, and she leaves her mother as next to kin, and then it's right here.

44:46.206 --> 44:47.608
See, it's Jacqueline Bouvier.

44:47.628 --> 44:48.029
Jacqueline Bouvier.

44:48.049 --> 44:51.175
And then right here, it's changed to Amanda Bouvier.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.422
Now, where did you get these?

44:52.582 --> 44:53.463
These were from Evelyn Lincoln.

44:53.483 --> 44:54.145
They're castoffs.

44:54.185 --> 44:55.427
They're canceled passports.

44:55.547 --> 44:56.028
She saved them.

44:56.088 --> 44:57.470
Otherwise, they're in the trash.

44:57.691 --> 44:59.494
Now, what kind of a value would you put on those?

44:59.795 --> 45:00.235
Right now?

45:00.396 --> 45:00.616
Yeah.

45:01.037 --> 45:02.980
Considering what we've seen?

45:03.201 --> 45:09.432
If somebody came in with these two passports and put them in an auction, out of context, out of the context of this collection?

45:09.452 --> 45:10.333
$52,000.

45:10.574 --> 45:11.435
I think so, yeah.

45:11.656 --> 45:11.976
Wouldn't you?

45:12.137 --> 45:12.637
I would think so.

45:12.678 --> 45:13.379
Look at that.

45:13.399 --> 45:13.619
I would.

45:13.639 --> 45:15.222
$50,000.

45:15.488 --> 45:20.057
Yeah, but the problem is, you're going to find another one.

45:20.077 --> 45:26.370
No, but the thing is, you're applying monetary value for items which are historically... I know, the pictures are quieter.

45:26.550 --> 45:28.554
How do you make classes?

45:28.574 --> 45:29.696
Well, come on, it's your business.

45:29.716 --> 45:30.919
I know, don't get me there.

45:31.159 --> 45:33.384
I know, I'm sweet.

45:33.704 --> 45:35.488
I'm sure the guts.

45:35.772 --> 45:36.774
Now, what's that?

45:37.135 --> 45:38.358
Yeah.

45:38.478 --> 45:39.541
Oh, those are Xeroxes.

45:39.641 --> 45:41.686
Those are pretty good Xeroxes.

45:41.706 --> 45:43.189
Yeah, they're called Xeroxes.

45:44.171 --> 45:46.036
The people love it.

45:46.056 --> 45:47.218
This is a favorite.

45:47.559 --> 45:50.085
Two people make it worth a quarter of an email.

45:50.825 --> 45:56.392
I'm not suggesting you need one.

45:56.452 --> 45:58.314
I would love one.

45:58.695 --> 46:03.881
No, I have the chocolate ones.

46:04.241 --> 46:06.664
I use multiple ones.

46:06.764 --> 46:13.913
I don't know how long they last, but they make you feel like it.

46:14.804 --> 46:17.709
So we have a whole box of the chalkboard.

46:17.729 --> 46:19.111
I'll give you some chalkboards to the road.

46:19.311 --> 46:20.734
Yeah, change your taste.

46:22.216 --> 46:23.178
I eat a lot of those.

46:23.198 --> 46:24.220
It's like the nose.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.922
Come on back here.

46:25.942 --> 46:31.752
These are my favorites.

46:31.932 --> 46:33.595
Oh, the flag?

46:33.615 --> 46:35.438
The flag on the car in Dallas.

46:36.320 --> 46:36.460
Yeah.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.061
Oh, can I see?

46:37.281 --> 46:37.582
Yeah.

46:38.764 --> 46:39.325
That's the flag.

46:40.467 --> 46:40.727
Yeah.
