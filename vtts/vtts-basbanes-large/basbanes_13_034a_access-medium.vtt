00:02.630 --> 00:03.591
David Shulman.

00:03.611 --> 00:08.197
The first thing I said when he presented me with this copy is the library copy is well preserved.

00:08.237 --> 00:10.019
It's got a hardcover or plastic.

00:10.580 --> 00:12.242
Well, that was a hardcover edition.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.866
This is a beautiful design.

00:14.966 --> 00:16.167
It should be preserved.

00:16.227 --> 00:22.275
What I'm going to do is give him a hardcover copy as well.

00:23.335 --> 00:26.239
He promised to send me another copy.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.621
I'll keep that as a reading copy.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.023
Yeah, I'd love to read it.

00:29.504 --> 00:30.405
Very impressive.

00:30.505 --> 00:31.767
I've ordered some new hard covers.

00:32.508 --> 00:36.574
The book is still in print in our cover, I'm pleased to see it, over four years.

00:36.594 --> 00:42.102
And the other, it's not really a criticism, but I'm chauvinistic about it.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.767
I don't think he did justice to the New York Public Library.

00:45.787 --> 00:52.397
He didn't give me enough space to see the importance of the library rare book division.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.682
And it's personnel.

00:56.003 --> 00:59.688
They have accessible personnel compared to other libraries.

00:59.708 --> 01:01.991
And I've been around the past years.

01:02.833 --> 01:06.197
The present staff is superb.

01:07.038 --> 01:08.280
Tops.

01:08.300 --> 01:08.660
A1.

01:11.144 --> 01:13.807
The collection is also A1.

01:13.827 --> 01:14.368
That's the best.

01:14.753 --> 01:19.118
It deserves more space and recognition and all that.

01:19.138 --> 01:21.060
This book, of course, was about collectors.

01:21.301 --> 01:25.645
But the only one you mentioned here was Bernie McTeague, whom we both knew very well.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.048
I wrote about James Lennox in there, too.

01:28.068 --> 01:41.824
What you did write about the past curators like Frank Mattson and others before him who were associated with the Red Book Division and the present staff.

01:44.302 --> 01:52.012
Maybe we can redress that in the new book.

01:52.173 --> 02:00.524
This new book is really more... I'm focusing more specifically on libraries.

02:00.544 --> 02:03.668
This really wasn't about libraries per se.

02:03.688 --> 02:08.494
This was about the impulse to collect and picking up on that thing.

02:09.576 --> 02:10.377
But anyway...

02:10.762 --> 02:12.987
Look, I did all the searches on you.

02:13.047 --> 02:14.991
You've had quite a few articles on the New York Times.

02:15.011 --> 02:16.234
You've had letters to the editor.

02:16.535 --> 02:19.321
Oh, yeah.

02:19.562 --> 02:21.646
You've been a Scrabble guy.

02:21.686 --> 02:23.370
You've been a cryptologist.

02:23.611 --> 02:28.281
A fascinating career in life.

02:29.155 --> 02:31.177
How long have you known Mr. Schollinger?

02:31.618 --> 02:39.808
I became the curator in 1992, so that immediately I met David, because he uses the division quite extensively.

02:40.228 --> 02:45.815
And with the cryptography collection, he's been giving us money, actually, to process it.

02:45.835 --> 02:48.879
So we've been dealing with that pretty regularly.

02:50.241 --> 02:51.642
Preservation at most.

02:51.662 --> 02:52.323
Preservation.

02:52.383 --> 02:53.104
Very important.

02:54.316 --> 03:02.290
So then in 94, when he became young, we moved his collections out of his apartment and his office.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.454
We went through and selected material for the library.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.679
He had a huge postcard collection that went to the U.S.

03:07.719 --> 03:18.298
History, Local History and Genealogy Division, and collections of engraved images of Washington and Lincoln that went to the print room and children's literature.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.044
tobacco ephemera, and all kinds of things that we collect.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.828
The Arendt's tobacco collection.

03:26.848 --> 03:30.673
I'm sorry, but he's pretty interesting.

03:30.914 --> 03:42.208
He's a lifelong reader, but he's a reader in the rare book world, which really does elevate him a little bit, doesn't it, from the typical reader who might come in?

03:42.228 --> 03:45.452
We have the same approach to the information.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.233
It's everywhere.

03:46.954 --> 03:48.977
And he starts with the most apparent

03:49.413 --> 03:55.279
follows all the references and bibliographic citations and looks at every book that pertains to the subject.

03:55.299 --> 03:55.899
I admire that.

03:56.300 --> 04:00.384
That's the way I do work, so we've necessarily encountered each other over and over.

04:02.165 --> 04:07.010
Because he's looking for, a lot of times, for the OED, the first appearance of the word.

04:07.050 --> 04:09.052
So I've done the same thing here.

04:09.092 --> 04:12.375
That's the real joy of this library.

04:12.395 --> 04:15.218
You have a question, you can find a good answer.

04:16.143 --> 04:19.048
because there's such a broad range of material.

04:19.068 --> 04:31.209
So if you've got a manuscript letter or a booklet inscribed, you can find the papers, the letters, the diaries of the person who it was inscribed to, and maybe read about the day they received it.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.254
I mean, that's amazing, all in one day, in one library.

04:35.015 --> 04:36.598
You were quoted in the Times piece.

04:37.372 --> 04:42.217
to the fact that he's the type of person that you're here to serve.

04:42.237 --> 04:45.359
He's a reader, he's a writer, he's a researcher.

04:45.379 --> 04:46.140
He's a collector.

04:46.220 --> 04:52.486
He makes his contribution back to the library.

04:52.666 --> 04:56.470
He's amazing.

04:56.490 --> 05:00.394
And how long have you been coming here?

05:00.414 --> 05:05.218
Since the days of depression in the 1930s.

05:05.654 --> 05:19.453
Since jobs were scarce at that time, after I graduated from high school and college, I had a lot of spare time on my hands, and so I spent a lot of it in the library.

05:20.374 --> 05:22.618
I just checked this every once in a while, it's fine.

05:22.638 --> 05:30.529
And I found enough to keep me interested, and I stuck with it.

05:30.549 --> 05:35.155
And then also, later on, I was fortunate to be able to get into the

05:35.810 --> 05:45.183
journalism game, which was my ambition as a youngster, because I had a brother who was a copy boy and one of the metropolitan newspapers.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.728
He inspired me.

05:48.748 --> 05:59.183
And then I met some very important writers, starting with the World Telegram, where A.J.

05:59.203 --> 06:02.948
Liebling was at that time one of the columnists or staff writers.

06:03.367 --> 06:05.069
And he did a profile on me.

06:05.089 --> 06:05.349
Really?

06:05.509 --> 06:05.930
Yeah.

06:06.270 --> 06:07.391
A.J.

06:08.032 --> 06:08.392
Leibling.

06:08.412 --> 06:09.393
Is that something we could get?

06:10.494 --> 06:11.535
No doubt.

06:11.555 --> 06:12.296
I'd love that.

06:13.617 --> 06:17.121
I mean, I'd like to do more than just an interview.

06:17.201 --> 06:21.325
Later on, he became staff writer for Talk of the Town for the New Yorker.

06:21.345 --> 06:23.327
That would be great to get a Leibling piece.

06:23.407 --> 06:24.469
Leibling, yeah, A.J.

06:24.569 --> 06:24.929
Leibling.

06:25.209 --> 06:27.872
Do you know generally when that might have been published?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.163
Do you have a rough idea what year?

06:30.744 --> 06:33.248
The profile was back in the 1930s.

06:38.877 --> 06:40.018
And what was the paper again?

06:40.058 --> 06:44.045
The New York World Telegram.

06:44.065 --> 06:49.293
You don't think you'd have that here?

06:49.333 --> 06:50.595
How would we find that?

06:50.615 --> 06:55.783
Would we have to go to an index?

06:57.755 --> 06:58.536
start with catnip.

06:58.556 --> 07:00.419
It may have been converted to microphone already.

07:00.499 --> 07:06.908
It may have replaced the hard copy with commercial film.

07:06.928 --> 07:10.974
But it would be in some kind of an index, like the New York Times index.

07:11.455 --> 07:16.823
No, there's no index to the world television.

07:16.843 --> 07:18.185
Well, I don't want to make it too hard.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.306
It's not too important.

07:19.527 --> 07:25.956
It was a short piece, but it got me started because

07:26.290 --> 07:37.742
I was able, after that, to get a position with the New York World Television as a feature writer for their Sunday magazine.

07:37.762 --> 07:39.183
And how long were you waiting for them?

07:39.924 --> 07:40.965
A very short time.

07:40.985 --> 07:49.394
But while I was writing for it, I was lucky enough to meet Hayward Broom, the writer.

07:49.954 --> 07:52.077
I know all these names.

07:52.257 --> 07:53.098
Yeah.

07:53.118 --> 07:55.420
He was a bear, a man, a husky man.

07:55.855 --> 08:02.341
You would come in with a big stack of books, sit down at the typewriter and dash off his column.

08:02.361 --> 08:04.523
To go back to Liebling, what was his interest in you?

08:04.603 --> 08:07.466
Were you already this fanatical researcher?

08:07.526 --> 08:18.896
At that time, I was an outstanding puzzle solver, a member of the National Puzzles League.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.197
The National Puzzle League?

08:20.217 --> 08:22.960
Yeah, of which I've been a member of for 50 years.

08:25.471 --> 08:26.592
Can you mention college?

08:26.612 --> 08:27.373
Where did you go to school?

08:28.475 --> 08:29.156
City College.

08:29.216 --> 08:30.137
Here in the city.

08:30.197 --> 08:31.419
And what did you study?

08:33.161 --> 08:35.744
General subjects.

08:35.764 --> 08:36.605
Bachelor's degree?

08:36.846 --> 08:38.588
For a Bachelor's degree, BA.

08:38.668 --> 08:44.376
I just kept going in the evening session while I worked during the day.

08:46.538 --> 08:53.267
And I kept going until they threw me out of City College because I had too many credits and I should have graduated a long time ago.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.485
But I was taking advantage because it was free tuition at that time.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.368
This is, again, still the 30s, right?

08:59.709 --> 09:00.430
Yes.

09:00.450 --> 09:05.277
So I accumulated 120 credits I needed for graduation.

09:05.297 --> 09:07.380
I wound up with about 140 credits.

09:07.620 --> 09:10.404
And they told me, oh, no, you can't make a career out of this.

09:10.965 --> 09:12.507
But you loved the education again.

09:12.627 --> 09:18.816
It was for the education and the wonderful teachers they had at that time.

09:19.336 --> 09:25.684
Among the outstanding teachers was Professor Mario Pei, who was a great linguist.

09:25.704 --> 09:26.165
He's famous.

09:27.186 --> 09:28.849
Mario Pei.

09:29.509 --> 09:30.310
Right, he's famous.

09:30.330 --> 09:33.214
He authored many books on languages and linguistics.

09:33.234 --> 09:34.816
Weasel Words is one of his books.

09:35.677 --> 09:37.179
Didn't he write a book called Weasel Words?

09:37.320 --> 09:40.063
Yes, yes, you know that.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.065
You guys are going way back.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.449
I'm going to go take off and write a few letters.

09:44.902 --> 09:46.143
By coming back?

09:46.304 --> 09:50.869
Yeah, give me a call if I don't, but by the time you're ready to go in.

09:50.889 --> 09:50.989
Okay.

09:51.469 --> 09:57.656
We will do a little biographical background here, and I think we have to go back in time.

09:58.817 --> 10:01.020
Can I take a few pictures of him in here?

10:01.280 --> 10:01.540
Sure.

10:01.881 --> 10:02.682
Nobody will be upset.

10:03.362 --> 10:04.404
How about a picture?

10:04.624 --> 10:10.150
When we're done, maybe in here, with the stuff, I think, and in your place.

10:10.315 --> 10:11.977
So I'll be back in a little while.

10:12.137 --> 10:13.738
I'm going to go write a few letters.

10:14.138 --> 10:18.923
You're going to talk about the war, and we've been here a few times.

10:18.963 --> 10:19.904
She knows my story.

10:19.924 --> 10:21.205
Our interview with Ricky Jay.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.066
Remember that afternoon?

10:22.506 --> 10:26.510
I didn't get lunch until 3 o'clock that day.

10:26.530 --> 10:26.870
Ricky's in here.

10:28.231 --> 10:29.492
Okay.

10:29.512 --> 10:37.420
So tell me a little bit about, you said you were at City College, and you were working for the World Telegram.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.002
What kind of stories were you writing?

10:40.336 --> 10:54.912
I did a feature on puzzles, which appeared on the comic page of the Sunday magazine, the miscellaneous puzzles, you know.

10:54.932 --> 11:10.208
And it was all right, but it didn't last too long because the New York Post was running puzzle contests, and I had an idea for a puzzle contest, and I went over to the New York Post.

11:12.263 --> 11:18.789
to see if they'd be interested.

11:19.590 --> 11:21.472
What started your fascination with puzzles?

11:21.492 --> 11:23.333
Is this just something that you've always enjoyed?

11:23.353 --> 11:40.870
Yes, as a youngster, I first got interested in puzzles when Houdini was editing a puzzle and magic section for the New York world.

11:44.343 --> 11:53.292
And back in the 1920s.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.797
So I got interested in that while I was in high school.

11:58.557 --> 12:02.241
And solving the puzzles, I turned out to be very good at that.

12:02.481 --> 12:04.624
This pretty much shaped your life to a great extent.

12:04.744 --> 12:11.270
Actually, this shaped, to a great extent, shaped your life, this fascination for puzzles.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.793
Yeah, well, intellectual fascination.

12:14.296 --> 12:28.454
in lexicography and words and puzzles like charades, enigmas, riddles, acrostics, crossword puzzles.

12:28.474 --> 12:32.239
Have you been pretty much able to solve most of the ones?

12:32.579 --> 12:34.682
Yeah.

12:34.702 --> 12:38.667
I was a completer, well I was known as a completer.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.041
What does that mean?

12:42.101 --> 12:44.704
International Puzzles League.

12:44.724 --> 12:58.722
They published a magazine once a month, a monthly magazine, called The Enigma, which featured all kinds of puzzles.

12:58.742 --> 13:05.851
And they had a solver's department where if you sent them the solutions, they give you the credit.

13:05.871 --> 13:10.717
And if you solved everything, they called you a completer.

13:10.737 --> 13:11.218
So...

13:11.452 --> 13:23.123
For a couple of years, I solved everything in that magazine, and another magazine devoted to cryptograms from the American Cryptogram Association.

13:24.364 --> 13:29.889
That was a bi-monthly magazine, and I solved everything at that time.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.453
And what was your profession?

13:34.274 --> 13:36.856
What did you do to make a living?

13:36.876 --> 13:38.978
Well, as I said,

13:39.177 --> 13:47.188
I approached the New York Post with an idea for a puzzle contest.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.952
This is, again, still in the 30s, right?

13:50.293 --> 13:55.820
Right.

13:55.840 --> 13:55.920
Yep.

13:55.940 --> 14:07.817
And... Paul Sarrison was in charge of their contest at that time.

14:10.126 --> 14:23.981
and the head of his own group, Publishers Service, or other newspapers, with a contest for syndicators.

14:24.001 --> 14:27.886
He told me that he liked my idea, but that he couldn't use it.

14:29.728 --> 14:35.654
And he said, however, since you are a very creative person, I can use you on my staff.

14:35.674 --> 14:36.315
That's great.

14:38.057 --> 14:38.918
I said, fine.

14:39.438 --> 14:42.701
He says, well, I told him I have other jobs.

14:42.721 --> 14:47.085
He said, that's all right.

14:47.105 --> 14:50.087
How much have you been making for the World Telegram?

14:50.868 --> 14:51.328
I told him.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.389
He said, I'll double that.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.650
How much were you making?

14:54.011 --> 14:54.431
Not much.

14:55.212 --> 14:56.673
It was just a Sunday feature.

14:56.693 --> 14:59.776
That's why I was looking for a full-time job.

14:59.936 --> 15:08.263
Also, I was on the WPA project as a teacher of English to foreign-born people.

15:08.564 --> 15:11.768
He asked me how much you're making on that.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.350
And I told him, he said, I'll double that.

15:14.692 --> 15:16.594
I want you to work for me exclusively.

15:16.614 --> 15:17.655
Isn't that spectacular?

15:17.736 --> 15:19.478
How do we spell this gentleman's name again?

15:19.498 --> 15:20.099
Sarazen.

15:21.340 --> 15:24.003
S-A-R-A-Z-N.

15:24.664 --> 15:26.567
Paul Sarazen.

15:26.587 --> 15:33.876
He was formerly a press agent for Sam Goldwyn in Hollywood.

15:33.896 --> 15:34.957
And he's the one that hired you?

15:35.278 --> 15:37.120
Yeah, he hired me, put me on the staff.

15:37.741 --> 15:42.948
And all I had to do is create the same kind of puzzles that they had been using up to that time.

15:45.091 --> 15:46.313
But he must have liked your flair.

15:46.373 --> 15:50.979
He must have liked the intelligence, I guess.

15:50.999 --> 16:00.473
Yeah, for being very intellectual and having a creative spirit.

16:00.653 --> 16:05.740
Of course, I wasn't like in the newspaper, with newspapers.

16:06.597 --> 16:08.139
You have different departments.

16:08.159 --> 16:14.508
You have the business department, the editorial department, the circulation department, and the promotion department.

16:14.528 --> 16:21.839
To increase circulation at that time, contests were very popular, especially games of skill.

16:22.059 --> 16:25.965
So the sweepstakes was illegal then.

16:27.247 --> 16:32.775
So the newspapers were able to really cash in on public interest.

16:32.795 --> 16:36.520
So you did this for how many years for them, would you say?

16:36.736 --> 16:50.316
What happened was that he undertook to do the first major contest nationwide with all grown cigarettes.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.881
$100,000 first prize.

16:53.901 --> 16:56.165
$100,000?

16:56.185 --> 16:56.325
Wow.

16:56.505 --> 17:00.811
At that time it was a lot of money.

17:01.052 --> 17:02.374
That's a lot of money today.

17:02.394 --> 17:05.258
And he had this stair set up.

17:05.626 --> 17:09.150
to make up the puzzles to be solved by the public.

17:11.732 --> 17:23.505
The people who buy packages of cigarettes and so on, and save the coupons, would be eligible for prize money.

17:23.525 --> 17:29.271
And there were three people, including myself, who made up the puzzles for that contest.

17:32.305 --> 17:35.548
Eiffel magazine came down, took out pictures, and so forth.

17:35.928 --> 17:39.691
There's a lot of publicity to it, because it was the biggest contest up to that time.

17:40.052 --> 17:41.593
Did they get any winners?

17:41.613 --> 17:42.994
Somebody went out, I don't know.

17:43.114 --> 17:44.335
Had winners.

17:46.277 --> 17:50.321
But they had ties, and then they had to have a tiebreaker.

17:52.302 --> 17:57.146
And the idea of a tiebreaker, that was part of my idea at that time.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.168
So you came up with really tough buses?

17:59.609 --> 18:01.350
Yeah, we had to make them very tough.

18:01.668 --> 18:04.893
What does it take to make a good puzzle?

18:04.913 --> 18:08.118
I mean, we always ask people what it takes to solve a puzzle.

18:08.138 --> 18:13.285
What does it take to make a good puzzle?

18:13.305 --> 18:19.555
It's mostly inspirational, like trying to make up a good poem.

18:19.575 --> 18:25.744
You have to be sort of interested, motivated, and inspired.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.152
Like Edgar Allan Poe was inspired when he wrote The Raven.

18:31.688 --> 18:36.413
which he considered the greatest poem ever written, better than Shakespeare.

18:36.433 --> 18:37.034
Which he did.

18:37.054 --> 18:38.335
He takes vanity, too.

18:38.495 --> 18:39.556
He does, doesn't he?

18:39.576 --> 18:40.677
Yeah, he takes vanity.

18:41.058 --> 18:43.080
Most writers have that.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.602
They do, and I think I contested that.

18:45.622 --> 18:48.085
They don't like to be criticized and stuff like that.

18:48.125 --> 18:54.592
Well, you don't like being criticized, but you don't like people to say that your stuff isn't good, I guess.

18:54.612 --> 18:56.734
I don't mind if you criticize it.

18:57.372 --> 19:02.420
Well, I try to be constructive in my criticism.

19:02.781 --> 19:10.974
There's one time I picked up a book by Kent Follett, bestseller.

19:10.994 --> 19:12.496
Eye of the Needle, I guess.

19:12.516 --> 19:13.538
Yeah.

19:13.558 --> 19:16.022
His book was Rebecca.

19:16.042 --> 19:24.375
It was about espionage during World War II, and it was involved

19:25.064 --> 19:28.930
some secret writing messages and code and stuff like that.

19:30.012 --> 19:38.505
And I wrote him a letter criticizing the method that he'd used for the secret writing.

19:38.585 --> 19:39.426
Did he answer back?

19:39.606 --> 19:41.489
Yes, he answered me.

19:41.509 --> 19:50.724
I got an answer from his villa in France saying, I wish I had you at my side when I wrote the book.

19:50.904 --> 19:51.004
Sure.

19:51.338 --> 19:57.145
So then you did this for how many years, would you say, in the newspaper?

19:57.466 --> 19:59.589
Well, the war came along.

20:01.191 --> 20:07.118
I must have done it for about three or four years.

20:07.779 --> 20:11.003
I got some department, but then I was dressed.

20:11.023 --> 20:20.215
In the meantime, anticipating that field war

20:21.376 --> 20:30.325
I took a special course offered by the Signal Corps, Cypress and Codes, cryptanalysis.

20:30.345 --> 20:31.246
And was that a home course?

20:31.306 --> 20:34.329
It was through the nail, yeah.

20:34.349 --> 20:38.473
Cypress and analysis, that was it?

20:38.493 --> 20:39.334
Cryptography.

20:39.354 --> 20:42.437
Cryptography.

20:42.457 --> 20:44.659
And this was offered by the Signal Corps?

20:44.679 --> 20:47.502
Offered by the Signal Corps.

20:47.522 --> 20:50.505
That would be Fort Pearl Harbor.

20:51.008 --> 21:11.672
for the outbreak of war, they were anticipating and trying to prepare, because up to that time they had very limited staff, such people who worked for the army or for military intelligence and so on.

21:11.912 --> 21:18.400
So thanks to Mr. Friedman, William F. Friedman, the man who broke the Japanese code,

21:18.667 --> 21:23.293
He wrote some textbooks.

21:23.313 --> 21:23.974
You worked with him?

21:23.994 --> 21:24.715
You met him?

21:25.175 --> 21:29.460
Well, I knew him before the war because I admired his work.

21:31.483 --> 21:35.568
And I went to Washington where I met him and his wife.

21:36.369 --> 21:41.836
She worked for the Treasury Department, the Secret Service.

21:41.856 --> 21:45.140
And he worked for the War Department in Washington.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.682
He was a lieutenant colonel.

21:47.253 --> 22:15.943
and he had done the same kind of work in World War I. So he had prepared these textbooks and a course in cryptography, and his department, they selected people that they thought would be interested in working in the Army if they were drafted.

22:18.252 --> 22:20.735
serving in military intelligence.

22:20.755 --> 22:29.984
And people, they consulted our organization, the American Cryptogram Association, and they tried to select those people who were very good salvers.

22:31.326 --> 22:33.828
So I was right up there.

22:33.868 --> 22:35.310
So you were recruited, actually?

22:35.350 --> 22:35.570
Yeah.

22:36.331 --> 22:38.153
I was invited to take the course.

22:39.574 --> 22:44.459
They conducted a very careful background check through the FBI.

22:46.902 --> 22:48.023
I can imagine.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.262
or you could be accepted.

22:50.442 --> 22:51.343
You're a New York native?

22:51.363 --> 22:52.164
You're born in the city?

22:52.224 --> 22:54.187
Yes, born here in New York City.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.508
You grew up in Manhattan.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.311
I know you live up in Brooklyn.

22:57.331 --> 23:06.702
Yeah, I grew up in Manhattan and lived in the Bronx for a while and then lived in Brooklyn ever since.

23:08.804 --> 23:13.550
So... What was your business or profession?

23:13.570 --> 23:15.993
What did your dad, your father do?

23:16.013 --> 23:17.655
Oh, he was a carpenter.

23:18.125 --> 23:39.416
He had to work through the Depression years, but before he, you know, in the 1920s, he did very well as a carpenter, a contractor, worked on some big jobs, including the construction of the Roxy movie theater.

23:40.237 --> 23:43.702
He took me there to the opening nights.

23:43.782 --> 23:45.044
That's exciting.

23:45.064 --> 23:45.765
In the 1920s.

23:47.007 --> 23:47.187
Yeah.

23:47.453 --> 23:55.161
But then came the stock market crash, and he, like everybody else, had difficulty finding work.

23:55.321 --> 24:03.208
The reason I ask is just curious to see if you picked up any of these interests from your parents and so forth, your interests and puzzles.

24:04.730 --> 24:05.270
None.

24:05.370 --> 24:09.535
I was like self-taught, autodidactic.

24:10.155 --> 24:13.298
Were there books in the family, in the household that you wrote with books?

24:13.378 --> 24:16.161
No, I had to go to my local library.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.674
I think I was a omnivorous reader.

24:19.976 --> 24:24.021
I ran across books of interest to me, books on puzzles.

24:30.270 --> 24:35.056
Sir, did you have an idea when you were a young man, I guess you wanted to view, I guess journalism?

24:35.998 --> 24:36.779
Yeah, I wanted to get into journalism.

24:36.799 --> 24:38.722
That's what you were pointing towards.

24:38.742 --> 24:42.246
So tell me, let's jump ahead to the war years, because that's kind of fascinating too.

24:42.266 --> 24:44.950
Why don't you tell me a little bit about what you did during the war?

24:46.128 --> 24:58.787
After I was drafted, the Army at that time was hectic.

24:58.887 --> 25:13.789
When the war broke out with Pearl Harbor and so on, they started drafting more and more people.

25:15.322 --> 25:24.915
became, I don't know what words to use to characterize what the Army was doing.

25:24.975 --> 25:31.103
They were assigning people here and assigned people there and very little logic behind the assignments and so on.

25:32.545 --> 25:43.320
So when I was drafted at that time, I notified Mr. Friedman being drafted into the Army.

25:44.077 --> 26:10.168
and the head of the Signal Corps, and I got a letter from General Maubourne, M-A-U-B-O-R-N-E, M-A-U-B-O-R-G-N-E, M-A-U-B-O-R-G-N-E.

26:10.807 --> 26:29.190
Little rather, he stated that as soon as you are drafted and you get an army serial number, please notify the authority of Governor's Island, and we will then try to get you into the single court.

26:29.210 --> 26:30.652
And that's what happened?

26:30.672 --> 26:34.717
I notified the authority of Governor's Island.

26:34.998 --> 26:37.501
Didn't hear anything from them.

26:37.521 --> 26:38.502
In the meantime,

26:40.304 --> 26:47.014
My boss, Paul Saracen, was reluctant to let me go, so he got me some deferments as a newspaper man.

26:47.074 --> 26:52.442
Important to newspaper writing a function?

26:52.982 --> 26:55.346
Yeah, very important.

26:55.366 --> 26:56.688
I'm in charge of the contents.

26:57.268 --> 27:01.114
The newspaper might suffer loss of circulation, whatever.

27:01.381 --> 27:04.425
They lose their talent like mine.

27:05.146 --> 27:10.633
But then after a while, the Army decided that there'd be no more departments.

27:10.693 --> 27:11.874
Things were getting critical.

27:11.914 --> 27:13.016
There were even more men.

27:13.677 --> 27:17.522
They had to activate new divisions and so on and so forth.

27:17.542 --> 27:21.106
It was not going so good, especially in North Africa.

27:21.126 --> 27:27.755
So I went along with my boss.

27:27.775 --> 27:29.717
I said, all right, stay on the job.

27:30.592 --> 27:32.314
and tried to avoid being drafted.

27:33.716 --> 27:45.690
So then when they started sending me letters from my local board asking me to report, I ignored those letters.

27:45.710 --> 27:57.645
And then I had advice from a friend of mine who said, look, you're about 28 years old and the government's planning to give the firmness to people

27:57.895 --> 27:59.477
28 years old at all.

27:59.697 --> 28:11.850
I said, I held out, I didn't report, and the government then changed the rule on the aid limitation, and I'm exempt.

28:12.711 --> 28:14.092
That could happen to you.

28:14.112 --> 28:14.693
Sure, sure.

28:15.453 --> 28:16.815
This is about 1942 or so, right?

28:16.835 --> 28:20.218
Yeah, I was like on the borderline about 28 years old.

28:20.419 --> 28:22.100
This is after Pearl Harbor.

28:22.261 --> 28:23.582
After Pearl Harbor.

28:24.170 --> 28:29.395
But then the government needed more and more people, so they didn't make any more changes, and I was stuck.

28:30.756 --> 28:48.712
And finally, a friend of mine who was working at the induction center in Manhattan with the Army, it was a sergeant who was a personal friend who lived in my neighborhood, said, Dave, you better report.

28:48.732 --> 28:52.455
The FBI has been notified they're going to get you.

28:52.688 --> 28:54.110
Well, that'll get your attention, won't it?

28:56.013 --> 28:56.113
Yeah.

28:56.133 --> 29:03.964
So I went immediately to the induction center and reported, and they said, you have to stay here.

29:04.685 --> 29:13.759
You're going to take your physical and all that and stay overnight and go directly to the camp where you are assigned.

29:14.480 --> 29:19.607
You can't go home like everybody else and wind up your personal adventure because...

29:20.988 --> 29:22.270
We can't trust you.

29:22.811 --> 29:29.761
You missed so many invitations to report, to be drafted.

29:30.462 --> 29:31.644
We're not trusting you.

29:31.764 --> 29:34.929
But they grabbed you once you went in signal court.

29:34.949 --> 29:35.550
They grabbed me.

29:35.570 --> 29:36.712
They held me.

29:36.732 --> 29:39.336
Then they sent me to Camp Upton.

29:39.596 --> 29:40.157
Camp Upton?

29:40.177 --> 29:40.818
Where is that?

29:40.838 --> 29:45.325
That was in Long Island.

29:45.541 --> 29:51.410
where then I was reassigned for basic training to the Air Force in Atlantic City.

29:53.573 --> 29:54.114
Wonderful.

29:54.134 --> 29:55.676
I said, I'll be in the Air Force.

29:56.137 --> 29:58.160
You know, it sounded good to me.

30:00.303 --> 30:13.422
Of course, a friend of mine, living in the same neighborhood, who got a letter from the Air Force to report, the same time I did, he reported immediately.

30:13.857 --> 30:15.278
And he was put in the infantry.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.263
And after two weeks basic training, he was sent to North Africa.

30:20.503 --> 30:24.087
So what happened to General Morborn all this time?

30:24.147 --> 30:24.567
No worries.

30:24.627 --> 30:27.810
Nothing was heard from them.

30:27.830 --> 30:32.735
And nothing from freedom.

30:32.755 --> 30:38.460
But being out in the Air Force in basic training, I figured, oh, I'll ride it out, see what happens.

30:38.480 --> 30:43.645
All of a sudden, there's a call for the Army Specialized Training Program.

30:44.502 --> 30:59.003
people with skills and languages and engineering and so on, they would be sent to colleges, special training, and then back to the Army to serve as engineers, as linguists.

31:00.025 --> 31:10.560
And I applied for Russian, because I had studied a little Russian on my own, and I thought maybe since we were allies now with Russia,

31:10.945 --> 31:18.536
They might use translators, interpreters, and so on when we meet up with the Russians in the European theater.

31:21.299 --> 31:38.303
Well, we just about finished with the nine months' training course in Russian, and at that time, all those who were studying Russian were sent back to New York City, to City College, from which I graduated.

31:38.823 --> 31:41.706
So I was comfortable with that, too, because I could go home.

31:42.708 --> 31:44.410
Sure.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.812
I passed it.

31:47.453 --> 31:56.624
After almost nine months, we were just about finished, because the Army decided to terminate it.

31:56.644 --> 31:58.907
The program, the project?

31:58.927 --> 32:08.678
Yeah, because Congress, some of the Congressmen in Congress had been getting letters from women saying, my son went to college, and why didn't he?

32:09.350 --> 32:14.256
get into this program and go back to college with specialized training.

32:15.798 --> 32:28.615
These boys are having it easy in college, while my son is in Guadalcanal in combat, and he's a college graduate of Yale, Harvard, whatever.

32:28.635 --> 32:33.361
So they decided, Congressman, that we were having too soft to snap and all that.

32:33.381 --> 32:34.362
At the same time,

32:34.628 --> 32:39.112
They were scraping the bottom of the battle because they're getting ready for the invasion.

32:39.152 --> 32:40.033
So where are we now?

32:40.453 --> 32:41.715
So you're up to 1944 now?

32:42.135 --> 32:43.917
Yeah, in the 1940s.

32:43.937 --> 32:46.479
So when did you go into the Army?

32:46.499 --> 32:46.699
In 42?

32:46.719 --> 32:47.920
42.

32:48.361 --> 32:49.482
So it's up to 44 now?

32:49.562 --> 32:50.863
No, 43.

32:50.903 --> 32:54.306
I went into 43, 44, and 45.

32:54.326 --> 33:02.374
So I'm in the Army, and the Army decided, instead of sending us back to our original office,

33:02.776 --> 33:04.919
sent me back to the Air Force, Atlantic City.

33:06.241 --> 33:17.838
They put us all on troop trains and sent us all the way down to Mississippi for a whole new division that was being trained and activated and so on.

33:19.140 --> 33:19.861
Be years later.

33:19.901 --> 33:22.505
But you were in your 30s at this point, too, right?

33:22.525 --> 33:23.687
I was around, yeah.

33:24.005 --> 33:28.771
Because my father is your age, and he was drafted at the same time.

33:28.791 --> 33:31.915
He was in his 30s, and they kept him.

33:31.935 --> 33:38.464
The older guys, they waited until really getting to the end of the war before these fellas were ready to ship up.

33:38.604 --> 33:43.891
So you were a little older than most of the other soldiers at this particular point, I think.

33:43.911 --> 33:44.993
That's worth noting.

33:45.013 --> 33:45.533
Isn't that true?

33:46.274 --> 33:50.200
You were older than most of the guys who were going to combat duty.

33:50.380 --> 33:52.763
So tell me a little bit about the work that you finally did.

33:53.367 --> 34:02.159
I was in contact with youngsters who were 18 years who were drafted into the army.

34:03.681 --> 34:15.257
I'll digress a little.

34:18.055 --> 34:30.716
This is a really incredible story.

34:31.898 --> 34:32.739
Hard to believe.

34:34.702 --> 34:36.425
I'm just going to put this in my eye on it.

34:36.545 --> 34:37.587
It's going fine.

34:37.607 --> 34:39.350
Hard to believe.

34:39.370 --> 34:39.671
Wow.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.033
Terrific response.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.696
That article in The Times.

34:43.337 --> 34:44.198
Well, here I am.

34:45.511 --> 34:47.173
You got it?

34:47.193 --> 34:49.175
I'd say, here I am from that article, too.

34:50.597 --> 34:50.877
Yeah.

34:51.819 --> 34:55.783
Douglas Martin, you see, had written me up once before.

34:56.524 --> 34:58.006
I'll get the story here.

34:58.026 --> 34:58.547
Yeah.

34:58.567 --> 35:00.189
He did two profiles on me.

35:00.849 --> 35:14.826
Each time, tremendous calls, including radio shows and TV producers, even the producer, David Letterman, called me up and wanted to say,

35:15.532 --> 35:18.916
put me on with David Letterman.

35:18.936 --> 35:20.738
But he started asking questions, you know.

35:21.679 --> 35:31.589
And I wasn't keen on the idea, so I just let it ride.

35:31.609 --> 35:33.271
And I was glad that he turned me down.

35:34.372 --> 35:43.682
Because some of my friends told me, you're a serious scholar, and you shouldn't be on a show with David Letterman, because he likes to make a baboon.

35:43.763 --> 35:46.867
He does mock people.

35:46.887 --> 35:48.529
Yes, and he might humiliate you.

35:49.311 --> 35:50.112
But he'll make fun.

35:50.452 --> 35:53.356
Yeah, he might make fun of you, and it's not at your level.

35:55.098 --> 36:05.232
Well, I have a good sense of humor, and the producer at one point asked me, is there anything humorous or funny about

36:05.735 --> 36:08.318
and that's economy and dictionary.

36:08.459 --> 36:11.042
I said, yes, and I gave a couple examples.

36:11.062 --> 36:19.553
But I didn't really want to appear on the show, and I was glad when he said, I'll let you know it's on an excuse.

36:19.573 --> 36:21.075
I said, that's all right.

36:21.095 --> 36:33.852
By the other hand, when I got a call from PBS, public broadcasting, it was Channel 13, a radio show with Mel Pate,

36:34.405 --> 36:37.008
Now, he's a very serious interviewer.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.610
He interviews books and writers and stuff like that.

36:40.571 --> 36:46.337
And I said, yes, I'll appear on his show.

36:48.699 --> 36:51.261
And I asked, how much would I be paying?

36:51.842 --> 37:03.113
He said, no, we have other prominent people who have appeared on our show, and they never took any money.

37:03.532 --> 37:07.877
I said, well, they can do it for nothing.

37:07.897 --> 37:09.338
I can do it for nothing, too.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.961
So I made a couple appearances.

37:11.981 --> 37:16.006
He liked me and invited me back two or three more times.

37:18.228 --> 37:19.930
And this is since this most recent article?

37:20.110 --> 37:23.534
No, that was on a previous profile of Doug Martin.

37:23.754 --> 37:26.417
So let's go back to World War II now.

37:26.517 --> 37:30.602
It's a very long, long story, but I'll try to short it.

37:30.734 --> 37:41.588
And there's sort of a digression, so we have to say at this point, after I finish with the war, I'll say, do you know French?

37:42.129 --> 37:43.671
I'm French.

37:43.831 --> 37:45.673
I know Mouton.

37:46.995 --> 38:00.673
It's a very popular... Which translates...

38:01.143 --> 38:04.407
We shall return to our sheep.

38:05.729 --> 38:16.482
That way, if you're a shepherd and you digress, and you lose track of your sheep, your flock, whatever subject, you will promise to return.

38:16.662 --> 38:17.463
Is that one word there?

38:17.503 --> 38:17.984
Revenor?

38:18.104 --> 38:18.845
Revenor.

38:18.865 --> 38:24.051
It's a very kind of saying.

38:24.071 --> 38:25.733
I like it.

38:26.168 --> 38:27.830
all the books on the location.

38:27.850 --> 38:30.013
I might even make a chapter title out of it.

38:30.133 --> 38:31.935
Yeah.

38:31.955 --> 38:43.289
A lot of writers like to use that expression when they find their digression, getting off the beaten path, getting a little bit out of focus.

38:43.309 --> 38:45.191
So anyway, this is about the Army.

38:46.132 --> 38:50.197
I went through all kinds of experiences and escapades.

38:50.738 --> 38:55.804
They put me on a troop train after I was trained to be a Russian interpreter.

38:56.493 --> 39:04.362
I wound up in the infantry down in Mississippi.

39:04.382 --> 39:12.892
Immediately, I applied for a transfer to the Signal Corps, and they transferred me to an anti-tank company.

39:12.972 --> 39:13.312
Jeez.

39:15.174 --> 39:23.884
Once again, I applied for a transfer, and they transferred me to combat engineers, all in the same camp, same division.

39:24.674 --> 39:30.822
And the officers tried to tell me that out of this division, we cannot transfer anybody.

39:30.862 --> 39:35.148
We have to be full strength when we go overseas.

39:38.732 --> 39:41.556
We can't spare any men.

39:41.576 --> 39:51.168
So when I was a combat engineer, I asked one of the officers at headquarters to approve my request for a transfer.

39:51.188 --> 39:53.331
He said, look, I was a lawyer.

39:53.935 --> 39:56.818
before I went to the Army, and I can't get a transfer.

39:57.499 --> 39:59.481
I said to him, oh, then, boy, you've got to lose.

39:59.681 --> 40:03.324
You know I'll be turned down, so you're careful.

40:03.344 --> 40:05.106
Sign it.

40:05.126 --> 40:05.807
So he signed it.

40:07.328 --> 40:08.870
And he said, oh, you're from Brooklyn.

40:08.910 --> 40:13.194
He said, I'll give you some advice, because I also came from Brooklyn.

40:13.214 --> 40:22.744
If you get called in by the colonel, I'm going to recommend that to the colonel that he called you in and went with you on your request for a transfer.

40:23.045 --> 40:36.126
We get called in by the colon, smile, and answer very frankly, whatever it is, whatever questions he'll ask you.

40:36.146 --> 40:38.570
I said, okay, fine.

40:38.590 --> 40:49.327
A couple of weeks later, I got a request from headquarters down in Mississippi, combat engineer in that division.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.689
The colonel wanted to see you.

40:52.154 --> 40:52.835
Go in there.

40:54.818 --> 40:57.763
He says, at ease.

40:57.783 --> 40:58.344
He says, I'm at ease.

40:59.226 --> 41:14.030
He says, soldier, if I decide to transfer you and assign you to combat, would you be willing to go into combat?

41:15.312 --> 41:17.155
I said, yes, sir, but I think.

41:17.576 --> 41:18.418
Fair to last.

41:18.438 --> 41:18.718
Yeah.

41:19.002 --> 41:23.833
I was in the Vietnam War myself, but I went through similar issues.

41:23.893 --> 41:24.936
We have a rapport.

41:25.036 --> 41:35.239
I was in public relations, public affairs, and I kept waiting to hear from people in Washington who wanted me.

41:35.607 --> 41:40.333
You know, all about the red tape and the routine.

41:40.353 --> 41:42.396
That's why I'm laughing.

41:42.416 --> 41:45.180
There are a few things like the boats that don't change.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.742
The military doesn't change.

41:46.782 --> 41:47.743
The boats are in mind.

41:49.565 --> 42:04.365
So I said, however, I think the Army would be making a great mistake in my case to put me in combat because I could save many, many lives with it.

42:04.565 --> 42:18.983
training and background I have as a person with a college degree and also trained in cypress and code, the importance of breaking the enemy code can save many, many lives.

42:19.103 --> 42:19.343
True.

42:19.363 --> 42:21.826
I mean, that's totally true.

42:21.906 --> 42:22.948
Yes.

42:22.968 --> 42:30.917
In fact, that was expressed in some of the books on the history of cryptography and espionage and so on.

42:31.858 --> 42:33.981
To be able to capture the enemy plans

42:34.957 --> 42:48.833
especially if they were in code or secret writing, they would crack those codes, as Friedman did with the Japanese code, the Enigma, I mean, the magic cipher machine.

42:48.853 --> 42:51.957
I have a book on that at home, The Enigma.

42:52.998 --> 43:00.427
So what did you, so they... He said, it's like putting a round peg in a square hole.

43:00.447 --> 43:03.090
He said, I like that.

43:03.796 --> 43:04.877
I like that reply.

43:05.017 --> 43:06.199
I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.922
I'm going to approve your transport.

43:08.942 --> 43:09.262
Really?

43:09.443 --> 43:11.305
I'm going to send it up to headquarters.

43:11.886 --> 43:13.007
This was Mississippi.

43:14.529 --> 43:16.511
Trade on the headquarters in Tennessee.

43:18.533 --> 43:19.474
It will be up to them.

43:19.515 --> 43:20.776
They're on a higher level.

43:21.797 --> 43:30.968
All I can do is push it, but I can't promise you that they'll approve it, but I'm giving you my approval.

43:33.074 --> 43:34.076
That's what he did.

43:34.897 --> 43:42.731
About a month later, an order comes in in Washington, D.C.

43:43.913 --> 43:51.245
in order for me to report to the military police in Washington, D.C.

43:51.305 --> 43:54.711
for further instruction as classified.

43:56.395 --> 43:58.137
I can't say anymore.

43:58.978 --> 44:15.019
I am to take the next train and appear immediately to Washington, D.C., down in Mississippi, and report to the military police for further instruction.

44:15.039 --> 44:20.867
My sergeant's brought out an order, called me out to the drill field, and he said,

44:21.117 --> 44:22.699
Yes, there'll be someone holding.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.923
Worries that he could command, and you're faster.

44:28.104 --> 44:33.870
You're going to the Pentagon.

44:33.890 --> 44:40.397
The commanding officer came in, and he likewise was mad.

44:41.197 --> 44:45.282
I got the transmitter, and he thought I would never get a transmitter.

44:45.342 --> 44:50.567
That's why he signed his approval when I gave him the blanks.

44:50.868 --> 44:59.440
He says, you cannot leave unless you turn in all your equipment.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.042
Let's see your rifle.

45:01.062 --> 45:03.385
It's really giving you a hard time.

45:03.425 --> 45:03.826
Yeah.

45:04.607 --> 45:05.929
Right.

45:06.269 --> 45:09.233
He was going to prevent me from leaving.

45:09.253 --> 45:12.237
So out of spite, is this what this is all about?

45:12.318 --> 45:12.838
The spite?

45:12.958 --> 45:13.860
Is he being spiteful?

45:14.040 --> 45:15.422
Well, you know, you were in the Army.

45:15.502 --> 45:19.848
There was a lot of prejudice and hatred and so on, envy and jealousy.

45:20.008 --> 45:20.689
Jealousy?

45:22.289 --> 45:33.302
I had one sergeant in New York Air Force when I was in basic training, and one day he comes over to me and he says, you wise guys from Brooklyn, we'll show you.

45:35.785 --> 45:44.736
He was from Ohio, a hillbilly from Ohio, big husky guy, and kept my mouth shut because I knew

45:45.577 --> 45:56.671
He had the power to court-martial me, because they even took some fellow who refused to get his hair cut short, and gave him six months in the guardhouse for refusing to obey an order.

45:58.213 --> 46:00.496
Right?

46:00.516 --> 46:01.557
Let's return to our sheep.

46:02.138 --> 46:03.619
Okay.

46:03.639 --> 46:05.902
So finally, I got that transfer.

46:05.942 --> 46:07.224
I got into the Singapore.

46:07.885 --> 46:12.090
I went through the Mill, Curry and Chosen's training.

46:13.133 --> 46:24.905
in a classified camp down in Virginia, and then I was assigned to Alaska to work on Japanese codes.

46:26.206 --> 46:32.373
We had a radio company in Alaska on the Aleutian Islands.

46:32.413 --> 46:39.100
They were intercepting Japanese radio messages, but they were in code.

46:40.101 --> 46:41.402
They were passed on to us.

46:41.737 --> 46:42.938
by the radio operators.

46:43.018 --> 46:49.326
We edited the work and passed it on by teletype down to Washington, D.C.

46:52.810 --> 46:59.197
When the war was over, we were sent to California for reassignment.

47:00.559 --> 47:06.646
I immediately went home because we were given furloughs and were supposed to come back.

47:07.507 --> 47:10.090
Instead of coming back to the camp in California,

47:10.542 --> 47:22.459
I wrote a letter to a commanding officer saying that it would be cheaper for the government to give me my discharge to save the fare from my return to the camp.

47:22.499 --> 47:26.145
I didn't have enough points that there hadn't been a comeback.

47:27.787 --> 47:35.398
All these guys were coming back from the Pacific, from Alaska, from Japan and Okinawa.

47:36.880 --> 47:38.102
So, commanding officer,

47:38.470 --> 47:41.894
Much to my surprise, Wilton, he said, sure, go ahead.

47:42.494 --> 47:45.377
Report to Fort Dix and pick up your discharge.

47:46.158 --> 47:47.640
Great.

47:47.700 --> 47:50.583
Anything really exciting that you worked on during the war?

47:50.603 --> 47:52.345
Did you break any codes?

47:52.625 --> 47:55.789
I broke a Japanese classification code.

48:03.617 --> 48:04.678
And how did that come about?

48:06.060 --> 48:07.161
How did you do that?

48:07.833 --> 48:30.473
We were handling these messages, and the Japanese had a system whereby they could indicate on each message, each telegram that they sent out, a radio message, the nature of the message, like top secret, secret, confidential, and so on.

48:30.493 --> 48:32.136
And there was a system to that request.

48:32.437 --> 48:39.163
You couldn't read what type of message it was because that was in code, a separate code from the message itself.

48:39.503 --> 48:46.590
And since down in Washington, D.C., they had already broken that code.

48:47.010 --> 48:48.892
They knew what was what.

48:49.813 --> 48:56.299
They would send the information to us as to the nature of the code.

48:56.359 --> 48:58.481
It changed each month.

48:58.501 --> 49:00.823
So I worked on it.

49:01.124 --> 49:02.866
and found out what the system was.

49:03.787 --> 49:10.494
Then the next time, Washington had to send us a changeover for the following month before they could send it to us.

49:11.435 --> 49:14.678
I instructed my outfit to send it to them.

49:16.000 --> 49:16.781
To Washington?

49:16.801 --> 49:17.441
To Washington.

49:19.444 --> 49:25.150
What we knew to be the correct classification of the messages.

49:25.170 --> 49:28.313
We got a commendation for that, my outfit, at the end of the war.

49:28.580 --> 49:33.107
They gave us a special certificate of honor throughout our field and the work we did.

49:33.388 --> 49:35.371
So what's the trick of breaking a boat?

49:35.391 --> 49:36.352
What's the trick to it?

49:37.895 --> 49:40.198
No trick, it's mostly hard work.

49:40.258 --> 49:41.600
Are you looking for patterns?

49:41.680 --> 49:56.123
Yeah, you look for patterns, frequencies, and there's a corroborative help when they capture

49:56.677 --> 49:59.039
an enemy, a spy and so on.

49:59.780 --> 50:13.154
But in the case of the military intelligence, they made every effort to capture like a sunken submarine and recover the code books on the enemy.

50:14.255 --> 50:15.256
They kept that secret.

50:15.937 --> 50:21.823
If an enemy ship or submarine went down,

50:22.175 --> 50:26.862
They always had instructions to destroy the code books immediately.

50:28.805 --> 50:29.686
Sometimes they didn't do that.

50:30.067 --> 50:36.597
Sometimes they didn't have time to do that or evacuate immediately to save their lives, you know.

50:36.617 --> 50:47.473
But the Army and Navy, they knew where the ship went down and they sent down deep-sea divers to try to recover the code books.

50:47.493 --> 50:48.735
And they did?

50:48.755 --> 50:49.937
In some cases they did.

50:50.322 --> 51:05.543
So you get out of the... I'm interested now, I'd like to jump ahead to the collections that you put together, those various... Yeah, it was just a time that I was interested in ciphers and codes and so on.

51:05.563 --> 51:16.399
I made every effort to collect any book or article that appeared on the subject, no matter what language.

51:16.419 --> 51:19.603
And it's been in the Depression days,

51:20.107 --> 51:40.075
it was easy to be a collector but books are very cheap at that time while I was collecting books I was supposed to let the dealers know that's what I'm looking for but some dealers were a little bit ignorant they said what?

51:40.115 --> 51:40.916
photography?

51:41.016 --> 51:47.565
I said no cryptography and they said no we don't have any

51:48.372 --> 51:49.693
And they probably did.

51:49.713 --> 51:54.699
And I point to a book over there, a pile of miscellaneous books.

51:54.759 --> 51:56.121
Yeah, I spot a book immediately.

51:56.801 --> 51:58.683
The American Black Chamber, I believe.

51:58.703 --> 52:00.245
You've got that?

52:00.265 --> 52:01.667
And where was this, down in Fourth Avenue?

52:01.787 --> 52:02.568
Did you read it?

52:03.789 --> 52:04.130
Yeah.

52:05.171 --> 52:16.303
I went to all the bookstores periodically, along book row, and checked whatever it was, what they had and so on.

52:16.570 --> 52:18.293
Because I had plenty of time on my hands.

52:19.915 --> 52:26.466
And then later on, when I was working for a puzzle practice, I also had plenty of money.

52:26.486 --> 52:28.590
There we are.

52:33.918 --> 52:37.664
What David is doing right now is he's requesting some items from rare books.

52:37.684 --> 52:41.110
These are items that he's already presented to the library.

52:41.393 --> 52:47.824
Yeah, he gave the library his collection of cryptography, and wonderfully enough, he also gave us his bibliography.

52:47.844 --> 52:49.167
That includes his library.

52:49.687 --> 52:50.769
Yeah.

52:50.789 --> 52:52.232
We'd like to see my bibliography.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.075
So now it's called a bibliography.

52:54.095 --> 52:59.665
So we have access to it, even though it isn't completely processed, which is the perfect way to get a collection.

52:59.685 --> 53:02.149
So often people give us material and they don't have a list.

53:03.351 --> 53:04.954
So we've got to, you know...

53:05.170 --> 53:11.317
We did make a list, too, of the other material you gave us in 1994, so I have an inventory of that as well.

53:11.337 --> 53:15.661
Can you give me a rough sense of the numbers of what he's given you?

53:15.681 --> 53:25.471
Well, in this collection of the cryptography, about a thousand books.

53:25.752 --> 53:28.114
I think there are about a thousand books in that collection, wouldn't you say?

53:28.475 --> 53:28.815
Yeah.

53:29.588 --> 53:38.422
And then with the multiple small collections, the children's literature, sort of like the boys' stories, group of things.

53:38.622 --> 53:39.484
Miniature books.

53:39.504 --> 53:42.709
Miniature books, dime novels.

53:44.391 --> 53:49.880
We didn't count the postcards, but I think there were about 1,700 item numbers in that.

53:49.940 --> 53:52.985
We didn't count the postcard.

53:53.005 --> 53:56.170
That was about 10,000 cards, wouldn't you say?

53:56.487 --> 53:59.370
Yeah, so you collect everything.

53:59.431 --> 53:59.991
20,000 cars.

54:00.011 --> 54:01.193
20,000 cars.

54:01.853 --> 54:03.375
So you're kind of a magpie, aren't you?

54:03.395 --> 54:06.499
You collect everything.

54:06.519 --> 54:07.961
No, there was a method in my mind.

54:07.981 --> 54:16.371
Yeah, there's a theme to it, and it's something that's really hard for people to do when they're making collections because they don't have the patience or the time that David put into it.

54:16.391 --> 54:18.433
Yeah, you have to understand if I'm about collecting.

54:20.276 --> 54:23.119
There are collectors, and then again there are collectors.

54:23.318 --> 54:26.423
There are collectors on one plateau, collectors on another plateau.

54:26.863 --> 54:32.532
I consider for one plateau collectors with deep pockets who can buy anything like J.P.

54:32.572 --> 54:32.912
Morgan.

54:35.076 --> 54:41.245
On another plateau, collectors who really appreciate what they're collecting and read what they're collecting.

54:41.265 --> 54:44.770
They're bibliophiles.

54:44.790 --> 54:46.693
We give them a more academic

54:47.264 --> 54:48.606
and respectful names.

54:48.626 --> 54:53.812
I look at the subtitle of my book, you see, Bibliophiles, Bibliophiles.

54:54.052 --> 54:54.933
That's it, that's right.

54:54.953 --> 54:56.315
Bibliomaniacs.

54:56.415 --> 55:02.502
The maniacs are those who want to have everything, have no sense of discrimination.

55:02.783 --> 55:03.564
They accumulate.

55:03.584 --> 55:04.545
Yeah, they accumulate.

55:05.085 --> 55:07.989
And the result is I've run into many collections.

55:08.109 --> 55:09.971
People want to sell me things and so on.

55:10.432 --> 55:14.176
And as we come down, take a look at my collection, I'm ready to retire.

55:14.437 --> 55:15.518
I want to get rid of all this.

55:16.719 --> 55:17.220
Collection.

55:17.470 --> 55:20.213
I take a look and see.

55:20.233 --> 55:27.359
Romance novels, paperbacks, trash of all kinds and so on, you know, not worth saving.

55:29.641 --> 55:30.783
They didn't understand.

55:31.143 --> 55:40.632
These people were like maybe laborers who suddenly became wealthy, had money to spend, and then some of them were buying books for investments.

55:41.553 --> 55:46.077
And you can't really invest on books unless you know and understand

55:47.018 --> 55:51.964
The value of books themselves, the interest of the value, I understand that.

55:51.984 --> 55:58.472
It's better to collect the Shakespeare first folio than to collect that forever amber by so-and-so.

55:58.912 --> 56:06.782
Well, not only that, but the method of, you know, the patience, the time, the opportunity, making it possible.

56:06.942 --> 56:13.009
I mean, David didn't collect everything out of one bookstore with one bookseller as a guy.

56:13.259 --> 56:14.280
went everywhere.

56:14.380 --> 56:18.005
He bought things at Swan for very little money.

56:18.105 --> 56:19.908
Every week I went through there all the time.

56:19.928 --> 56:22.150
He knew what he wanted and he waited and he saw it.

56:22.191 --> 56:23.372
You said there's a method.

56:23.392 --> 56:24.634
In your view, what's the method?

56:24.654 --> 56:25.875
And then Dale will give David a chance.

56:26.236 --> 56:31.483
I think his theory, or my theory of it, is that he had an idea.

56:32.304 --> 56:34.707
He found an outstanding example of one thing.

56:34.727 --> 56:36.609
The idea being what?

56:37.170 --> 56:39.633
To collect, for instance, the Jacquard printing.

56:39.653 --> 56:40.414
He collected

56:40.900 --> 56:45.587
portraits of people and drawings that were printed with a jacquard loom?

56:45.768 --> 56:46.429
How do we spell that?

56:46.449 --> 56:46.970
Jacquard.

56:47.090 --> 56:47.611
Jacquard.

56:47.651 --> 56:50.115
J-A-C-Q-U-A-R-D.

56:50.455 --> 56:51.156
Okay.

56:51.176 --> 56:58.127
So he had one piece, and then he had several pieces, and then he has a whole collection, including a portrait of Jacquard.

56:58.468 --> 56:58.788
Yeah.

56:58.808 --> 57:02.895
And he has a story about the portrait of Jacquard that he saw hanging, was it in City Hall?

57:03.556 --> 57:04.237
The City Hall.

57:05.259 --> 57:07.482
Somewhere back around 1910,

57:08.204 --> 57:18.999
He spent about $10,000 to acquire this portrait of jacquard woven fabric on a jacquard loom.

57:19.019 --> 57:22.844
I don't know if you're familiar with the jacquard process of weaving.

57:23.785 --> 57:27.470
He invented certain... So how did you get interested in a jacquard loom?

57:27.510 --> 57:33.839
He spent $10,000 on this portrait, and they got down City Hall down in the basement, and they don't know anything about its background.

57:35.081 --> 57:36.743
I did research on it.

57:37.448 --> 57:47.581
And it was only by chance that I found out that the famous mathematician, Babbage... Oh, he's famous.

57:47.982 --> 57:48.502
Yes.

57:48.522 --> 57:52.447
He was the first one to invent a calculating machine.

57:52.708 --> 57:53.669
I've just been looking him up.

57:54.630 --> 57:56.092
Yes.

57:56.352 --> 58:06.105
In a diary, he wrote about a trip he made to the southern part of France where Jacquard had a factory and they were weaving...

58:06.372 --> 58:14.624
all kinds of patterns and silk and other fabrics and so on for commercial and artistic distribution.

58:15.345 --> 58:25.660
And as souvenirs, they had a portrait of Jackhart that they would give away to prominent visitors like Fadich.

58:25.680 --> 58:28.825
And he acquired that portrait, and that's how I know it came about.

58:28.845 --> 58:35.755
It was never offered for sale, and it was just reserved for the visitors in Jackhart.

58:37.118 --> 58:43.190
So for our use, of course, then we can present a whole variety of examples of Jacquard crack.

58:43.250 --> 58:46.897
And this is not the kind of thing that you would normally collect on your own, is it?

58:46.957 --> 58:47.057
No.

58:47.518 --> 58:50.424
You have to understand what you're collecting and the rarity.

58:50.805 --> 58:53.730
And his understanding of what it is that he's buying and why.

58:54.211 --> 58:57.237
So, for instance, the children's, the literature, the boys' books,

58:57.622 --> 59:00.686
Children's literature is the strength of the New York Public Library.

59:00.706 --> 59:06.734
And he picked up this one area of books that were printed for boys, boys' stories, boys' books.

59:06.934 --> 59:10.559
It's kind of a... I think it's an extension of the dime novel.

59:11.260 --> 59:12.842
Is it a pulp kind of a thing?

59:12.862 --> 59:14.765
Or is it actually hardcover books?

59:15.005 --> 59:15.886
It's hardcover books.

59:16.167 --> 59:16.887
Hardcover books?

59:16.928 --> 59:17.428
Hardcover books.

59:17.528 --> 59:26.380
And it's stories about, well, famous Americans, Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders, and also about different...

59:28.520 --> 59:35.147
careers, you know, firemen, policemen, thematic stories, newspaper men, and then it's also stories about boys.

59:35.167 --> 59:48.580
You know, and maybe you can give me a comment on this, what's really quite remarkable, and I didn't see it in the New York Times piece, but I think, and it should be stated, not only are you getting the collection, but you're getting it, you're also getting him.

59:49.561 --> 59:58.290
I mean, most collections come afterwards, as part of a will or whatever he saw fit to turn this material over to

59:58.591 --> 01:00:01.155
at a time when he can help you out with it, tell you what it is.

01:00:01.175 --> 01:00:02.538
And we did struggle with that, didn't we?

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:07.045
He can be a resource, he can be as important a resource in the collection as any item in it.

01:00:07.065 --> 01:00:22.551
Yeah, that's what I meant when I said that he also writes about his collections and publishes, and that gets the word out there with his bibliographies and the descriptions, and the descriptions of his collecting and his collections, and it helps us because people then know what we have, and he helps us with the research.

01:00:23.011 --> 01:00:23.612
Absolutely.

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.155
He writes about the dime novels,

01:00:25.523 --> 01:00:27.847
We have a large collection, by the way.

01:00:27.867 --> 01:00:31.233
You said you were... I mentioned to you about that.

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.134
You saw my article.

01:00:32.174 --> 01:00:32.915
I did, yes.

01:00:32.936 --> 01:00:35.279
Where do you get published mostly?

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.183
American Speech.

01:00:37.543 --> 01:00:46.799
It's a scholarly publication, quarterly, now being published by the University of Alabama.

01:00:46.819 --> 01:00:46.999
H.L.

01:00:47.039 --> 01:00:48.662
Mencken helped to found it.

01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:53.896
devoted to the study of the American English language.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:58.964
And you've also had articles in Brooklyn Bridge, which is a regional... No, not in Brooklyn Bridge.

01:00:59.164 --> 01:00:59.525
Not yet.

01:00:59.905 --> 01:01:00.426
Not yet.

01:01:00.446 --> 01:01:01.427
And then Biblio.

01:01:01.447 --> 01:01:03.691
They were interested, but they didn't do anything yet.

01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:04.973
Biblio?

01:01:04.993 --> 01:01:06.575
Biblio, yes.

01:01:07.617 --> 01:01:15.048
A special article on the Cypher Collection.

01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:16.050
I had the title

01:01:16.452 --> 01:01:17.473
I've got all the magazines.

01:01:17.493 --> 01:01:21.117
Best kept secret, the New York Times, catalog and everything.

01:01:21.297 --> 01:01:22.138
Right.

01:01:22.158 --> 01:01:22.338
Right.

01:01:22.398 --> 01:01:24.100
But we have your bibliography.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:24.681
Okay.

01:01:24.701 --> 01:01:24.941
Okay.

01:01:24.961 --> 01:01:26.403
So I'm going to go get these books.

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:26.683
All right.

01:01:26.763 --> 01:01:29.366
And when we go in, you guys are going to be real quiet, right?

01:01:29.406 --> 01:01:30.847
Because there's a lot of people in there.

01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:32.889
It's a busy afternoon.

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.492
We'll go out again before I do a discussion with you.

01:01:35.512 --> 01:01:37.294
But I want to take a few pictures of you here.

01:01:37.314 --> 01:01:37.995
Yes.

01:01:38.015 --> 01:01:39.597
This is a beautiful space.

01:01:39.657 --> 01:01:41.198
The light is perfect in here.

01:01:41.218 --> 01:01:41.859
A little dark in there.

01:01:41.879 --> 01:01:42.780
A little dark in there.

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.294
You know it's dark in there.

01:01:44.314 --> 01:01:45.255
We don't want it too dark.

01:01:45.275 --> 01:01:45.515
Oh, yeah.

01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:48.178
My picture of the Times came out too dark.

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:49.079
Oh, I didn't think so.

01:01:49.159 --> 01:01:50.281
I thought it was great.

01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:53.604
In fact, I've told people they ought to order that from the Times, so that's probably the pictures.

01:01:53.664 --> 01:01:56.367
They're going to send me one of the pictures.

01:01:56.387 --> 01:01:57.989
He took about 50 pictures.

01:01:58.169 --> 01:02:01.393
He's the dean of the photographers.

01:02:02.013 --> 01:02:02.594
Jack Manning.

01:02:02.874 --> 01:02:04.236
Jack Manning, yes.

01:02:04.256 --> 01:02:05.497
No, I've already checked it out.

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:09.021
He's got an ordinary little camera with him and some Rosser film.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:19.226
You know, there's one other thing that you may be interested in.

01:02:19.246 --> 01:02:23.573
When Mr. Shulman and I talked initially about the collection, he told me what happened.

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:24.856
We had contacted Sotheby's.

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:27.119
You contacted Sotheby's, didn't you, at one point?

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.204
Yes, for the second copy of Trithemius.

01:02:30.865 --> 01:02:34.992
But remember when you contacted, you said you contacted him about your collections as a whole?
