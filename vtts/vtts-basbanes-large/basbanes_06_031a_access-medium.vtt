WEBVTT

00:04.739 --> 00:07.483
How do we pronounce your name?

00:07.663 --> 00:08.004
Karpolis.

00:08.224 --> 00:08.725
Karpolis.

00:09.346 --> 00:09.466
Right.

00:09.486 --> 00:09.987
We're Greek.

00:10.027 --> 00:11.349
It almost looks like a Greek name.

00:11.469 --> 00:11.990
It's not O-U-S.

00:12.010 --> 00:13.532
It's E-S.

00:13.552 --> 00:14.293
It's a slight difference.

00:14.313 --> 00:15.135
Well, very close.

00:15.375 --> 00:15.896
It's Austrian.

00:16.256 --> 00:17.178
It's Austrian.

00:17.198 --> 00:17.799
Yeah.

00:17.819 --> 00:18.780
Well, it used to be Austrian.

00:18.820 --> 00:29.236
Now, I guess, it's from a city named Brandeis, which is on the border, on the very border of Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.

00:29.256 --> 00:31.860
So it depends on where they were standing at the time.

00:32.110 --> 00:36.196
But at that time, it was part of the Austrian, Hungarian empire.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.962
So it's, I guess, Austrian, but now it's something different.

00:40.963 --> 00:45.670
Really, Bart Orbeck told me that when I was coming out to California, I really had to see you.

00:45.690 --> 00:53.702
He said my book would be incomplete without including you.

00:54.063 --> 00:56.847
And he really told me very little about you.

00:56.867 --> 00:57.888
He said, come out and meet you.

00:57.949 --> 01:00.312
And so this is like

01:01.152 --> 01:02.073
kind of new to me.

01:02.093 --> 01:10.300
I'd like to say I've done a lot of background, but really I haven't because I don't know much, but we're going to tell the world in this book about you if that's okay.

01:10.601 --> 01:12.602
This is a private collection that we're looking at?

01:12.622 --> 01:18.127
This is a private collection, although our museums are open to the public and they're all free.

01:18.268 --> 01:23.072
There's no charge for either any admission or services.

01:23.773 --> 01:28.577
We are very well known throughout the world in various universities by we.

01:29.114 --> 01:33.058
Me, myself, and I had, who knows, my wife and the kids, whatever.

01:33.358 --> 01:37.883
The libraries, I should say, are quite well known throughout the world in universities and so forth.

01:37.903 --> 01:53.219
And we get quite a few scholar requests, either for Xeroxes or microfilm, or some of them want to come and visit the library and actually study the manuscripts in person.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.421
And this we do free also.

01:55.481 --> 01:56.823
We provide Xeroxes.

01:57.043 --> 01:58.885
You're happy to provide Xeroxes?

01:59.270 --> 02:01.073
You don't mind providing?

02:01.173 --> 02:04.177
No, that's what we, if you read that, that's what we are here for.

02:04.317 --> 02:06.521
It's not like the HRC in Texas where they won't copy a thing.

02:06.981 --> 02:07.642
Oh, is that right?

02:07.743 --> 02:08.704
I didn't realize that.

02:08.724 --> 02:09.846
The HRC.

02:09.866 --> 02:13.611
The Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas.

02:13.631 --> 02:29.074
We will not only copy anything, but even if it doesn't have publication rights on it, which usually go partly with the owner of the manuscript and partly with the heir to whichever state it was,

02:29.797 --> 02:33.002
Whoever, you know, for example, King Henry VIII.

02:33.022 --> 02:38.911
King Henry VIII's heirs have publication rights, and we all know the manuscript has some King Henry VIII things.

02:39.331 --> 02:40.293
Quite a few, really.

02:40.313 --> 02:41.494
Very huge production.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.859
Is this going to give me some idea of the general holding?

02:44.880 --> 02:45.701
Yes, absolutely.

02:46.161 --> 02:47.243
What is your profession, sir?

02:47.844 --> 02:51.329
Well, I was a mathematician and a teacher on time.

02:52.491 --> 02:56.597
And then I wanted to teach full-time.

02:57.353 --> 03:02.560
But teaching salaries were not that great back in, this was 20 years ago.

03:03.442 --> 03:17.802
And in order to supplement the income I had from being a mathematician in industry, I decided to invest a few real estate houses.

03:18.863 --> 03:19.905
Invest in a couple of houses.

03:19.925 --> 03:22.268
Invest in houses, yeah, a couple of them.

03:22.308 --> 03:25.032
Because at that time, the rents were more than the payments.

03:25.636 --> 03:27.618
And so you could make a profit now.

03:27.658 --> 03:29.760
You know, your payments are doubled.

03:30.061 --> 03:32.503
But at that time, you could make $10 a house.

03:32.523 --> 03:34.706
What are we talking, 60s, 1960s?

03:34.906 --> 03:37.068
In the late 60s, yeah, very late 60s.

03:37.889 --> 03:43.975
So I invested in several of them in order to become a full-time teacher.

03:44.876 --> 03:52.284
And by the time I was ready, by the time I had enough several houses in order to teach, the industry was laying off people.

03:52.925 --> 03:54.867
And they were all going anywhere they could.

03:55.471 --> 04:21.748
uh like it was like during the old crisis in 73 and they were going anywhere they could including the teaching job they're taking up everything because they didn't want to be unemployed and so there wasn't any openings at the time i couldn't just walk over to a teaching job because there's 5 000 applicants and so i decided well i'll invest a few more houses and you know i'll even be better off when i can get with when the time comes it turns out that by the time

04:21.948 --> 04:26.494
The time came, and I was ready, and the teaching positions were available.

04:26.655 --> 04:30.480
I had so many houses that I had no time to teach, in fact.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.184
And I had to quit my industry job to take care of the houses.

04:33.224 --> 04:35.026
What was the industry job?

04:35.046 --> 04:36.208
I was a mathematician at G.E.

04:36.368 --> 04:38.672
Temple, it was called.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.274
Are you a Californian?

04:41.155 --> 04:45.681
I was born in Santa Barbara, believe it or not, but as a child, I lived in Minnesota.

04:47.043 --> 04:48.225
I was

04:49.792 --> 04:58.406
I was born in 1936, and when the Second World War started, I was, well, four or five years old, my parents couldn't speak Japanese, and they thought they might have to.

04:58.426 --> 05:06.298
They thought the Japanese were going to take over California up to the Rocky Mountains, and so everybody has to get back east.

05:06.650 --> 05:11.134
So they believed this, and we went back to Duluth, Minnesota, if you can believe.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.299
Were your parents, are they Californians?

05:15.439 --> 05:22.926
My mother was born in Duluth, and even though she came out here as a child, she was born there, so that's why we went back there.

05:23.066 --> 05:26.750
But really, it was fear of the Japanese coming to California?

05:26.770 --> 05:27.391
Yes, absolutely.

05:27.431 --> 05:28.832
Nothing else, in fact.

05:28.852 --> 05:34.598
And so we moved back there, and we lived back there for my entire school career.

05:34.915 --> 05:36.416
And I thought I was trapped like that.

05:36.436 --> 05:40.100
I had no idea I could even move, you know, because you're there.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.021
You have to be there.

05:41.702 --> 05:50.770
But when I got married, all of a sudden, I was working for Remington Rangina back at the time, and they said, how would you like to move to sunny California?

05:50.790 --> 05:52.091
Oh, sunny San Diego.

05:52.652 --> 05:53.092
Oh, no.

05:53.112 --> 05:55.475
How would you like to move to San Diego?

05:55.495 --> 05:57.397
And I couldn't remember where San Diego was.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.218
That was a very small town at the time.

05:59.238 --> 06:01.040
Maybe that's in Miami or something like that.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.441
They said, it's in sunny California.

06:03.102 --> 06:04.163
And all of a sudden,

06:04.970 --> 06:05.811
Something clicked.

06:05.831 --> 06:08.295
I said, what am I doing in Minnesota?

06:08.435 --> 06:10.478
I mean, I don't have to stay here.

06:10.539 --> 06:21.135
So we accepted their offer of coming out and starting it with several other people starting at the UNIVAC branch in San Diego.

06:21.155 --> 06:22.677
And how old were you?

06:22.697 --> 06:24.760
I was 22 at the time, I think.

06:24.780 --> 06:28.927
Could you just give me a little fast biographical education where did you go to school?

06:29.007 --> 06:32.412
Okay, went to the University of Minnesota and got a

06:32.662 --> 06:58.585
bachelor's there and worked towards a master's there and transferred out here when we I was working on my master's when we transferred out to San Diego with Unibac and got my master's at San Diego State and then I worked on a PhD program at University of California in Santa Barbara and did all the coursework but didn't take the test by that time I had so many houses that I just couldn't

06:58.801 --> 07:00.764
So you became a real estate tycoon.

07:01.024 --> 07:05.371
So I became a real estate tycoon, although that was not my first desire.

07:05.411 --> 07:06.733
I wanted to be a teacher.

07:07.454 --> 07:09.477
But it's important.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.601
This certainly gave you the means to become... That's right.

07:12.641 --> 07:23.998
By the time we opened our eyes, we had so many houses, we didn't know what to... You know, I knew houses were going up and bad because the baby boomers could see the huge classes in school.

07:24.316 --> 07:26.398
from the 9th grade down to 10th grade up, nobody.

07:26.518 --> 07:30.963
And then next year, this whole big mass of people would be 10th grade down and nobody from 11th grade up.

07:30.983 --> 07:33.806
So you could see this huge mass going through the school system.

07:33.826 --> 07:39.393
And as soon as they got out of school, you know they would have to inundate the housing stock.

07:39.453 --> 07:42.396
And so you knew the prices were going to go up.

07:42.416 --> 07:53.428
And so although my first goal was just to buy enough to profit from this and also to increase the income, which it did at the time,

07:54.033 --> 08:01.462
By the time the jobs for teaching were available, I had so many of them that I thought, well, you know, I can't do anything now.

08:01.542 --> 08:02.843
I've got to spend full time.

08:02.863 --> 08:03.784
Might as well just get more.

08:03.844 --> 08:06.367
So you would call yourself an investor at that point?

08:06.387 --> 08:06.748
Yes.

08:06.808 --> 08:14.016
So I became a full-time investor and just went out with a vengeance thinking, well, I know they're going to go up.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.498
Why don't I do it big?

08:15.618 --> 08:17.820
And this was largely in the Santa Barbara area?

08:18.061 --> 08:19.482
Just Santa Barbara area, right.

08:19.502 --> 08:20.624
Which took off like crazy.

08:20.664 --> 08:21.745
Which was probably...

08:21.843 --> 08:25.027
The number one place to buy.

08:25.047 --> 08:29.293
So that's what gave me the background, the money to do this, I guess.

08:29.533 --> 08:35.581
And so now tell me about this passion, which certainly must have become that, a passion.

08:36.262 --> 08:42.551
One day... Do you have any idea when this one day is to... One day back in 1968, I think it was.

08:42.631 --> 08:46.776
Or 70, I'm sorry, 78 or 79, I forget what it was.

08:46.797 --> 08:47.918
78, I think.

08:48.961 --> 08:55.667
My wife and I were at the Huntington Library, which has paintings and a library manuscript.

08:56.748 --> 09:02.293
And we looked in one of these cases and we saw a document which we couldn't believe.

09:03.014 --> 09:09.199
It was a pass that Lincoln gave to one of his bodyguards before the night he was killed.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.583
And we said, why is this not in the National Archives?

09:13.603 --> 09:17.327
Why is this in Mr. Huntington's collection?

09:17.367 --> 09:18.748
Why is it not in the National Archives?

09:19.150 --> 09:26.400
And they informed us that the National Archives was not opened in 1776, like most of us think.

09:26.961 --> 09:28.884
In fact, it wasn't even built until 1935.

09:31.007 --> 09:36.895
And they weren't even able to obtain the Declaration of Independence until 1952.

09:36.915 --> 09:44.486
Well, I don't know where it was in 1951, but I was around, you know, I could have run over there and done it.

09:44.506 --> 09:48.972
And so they informed us that we could see these things being

09:49.795 --> 09:55.321
bought and sold and exchanged if we go to Sotheby's or Christie's in London or New York, which we did.

09:55.361 --> 10:06.572
And all of a sudden we really almost fainted because we saw documents which made the Huntington's documents look like nothing.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.294
And this was just the past.

10:08.334 --> 10:11.597
We saw the Emancipation Proclamation of the United States.

10:11.857 --> 10:14.240
We saw the Declaration of Independence of Peru.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.601
We saw the Constitution.

10:15.621 --> 10:18.604
I mean, these are the original handwritten drafts for these

10:19.192 --> 10:22.736
world-known documents, you know, and they were selling them.

10:23.156 --> 10:30.043
You know, to get enough money, you could buy the Constitution of the Confederate States of America, you know, not at checkout.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.587
But, I mean, so what?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.549
It still has to have something.

10:35.649 --> 10:36.229
Oh, well, certainly.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.511
I've got to have this thing.

10:37.531 --> 10:46.920
Yes, well, you know, I'm sort of materialistic in that respect, too, of course, but to think that the history of these things, I don't know if I had a

10:47.525 --> 10:49.187
love of history before.

10:49.207 --> 10:50.529
I must have, I guess.

10:51.570 --> 11:02.883
But it really impressed me that these super important world-class original documents were not already impounded somewhere.

11:02.923 --> 11:13.396
And so we decided, I decided, to go at it with a vengeance and see how many of these I could get before people realized.

11:13.476 --> 11:16.840
I mean, I couldn't believe that hundreds of years I'm the first guy to realize this.

11:17.309 --> 11:30.974
Although, you know, if reading some books, you realize there are people who went after these things, but maybe they were so inexpensive at the time that if they went up in value, they thought, well, gee, that's too expensive.

11:31.455 --> 11:37.967
If something is $5,000 and goes up to $20,000, they think, oh, my God, why should I pay $20,000 in the Declaration of Independence of

11:38.268 --> 11:40.051
Peru, because that's how it's expensive.

11:40.071 --> 11:41.794
Do you have a Declaration of Independence of Peru?

11:41.814 --> 11:42.775
We did buy that, right.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.118
And when did you buy that?

11:44.138 --> 11:46.021
Actually, Sotheby's, I think.

11:46.461 --> 11:48.605
So you would travel to New York for these shows?

11:48.625 --> 11:51.409
I actually would send agents there and have them bid.

11:51.449 --> 11:55.516
I would look at the catalogs and choose things and send them and have them bid.

11:55.536 --> 12:02.087
And so we decided to, as I said, go out with a vengeance, and we just kept on bidding.

12:02.247 --> 12:05.372
Of the things that were really important, we just kept on bidding until everybody dropped out.

12:05.555 --> 12:08.159
We figured if somebody else was bidding, it must be worth at least that.

12:08.239 --> 12:09.961
It's the underbidder theory.

12:10.161 --> 12:11.483
The underbidder theory, right.

12:12.725 --> 12:29.348
To digress for a moment, Malcolm Forbes, it's a little late Malcolm Forbes, who was telling a story one time, and he was talking to Ross Perot, who is really sort of an amateur manuscript person.

12:29.368 --> 12:31.732
He bought a couple of them, great ones.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.334
But they were both bidding on

12:34.799 --> 12:37.363
a copy, I think, of the Emancipation Proclamation.

12:37.383 --> 12:38.405
It wasn't even the original draft.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.767
It was just a printed copy.

12:40.288 --> 12:44.235
But somebody had gotten Lincoln's signature, a real signature on it.

12:44.815 --> 12:45.897
And they were both bidding on it.

12:46.779 --> 12:48.882
And it finally went for something like $400,000.

12:48.922 --> 12:50.805
This is from Massachusetts.

12:51.627 --> 12:53.750
They found this in a library in Massachusetts.

12:53.910 --> 12:55.132
Yes, that's very possible.

12:56.034 --> 13:00.942
And so they start talking later, and they

13:01.512 --> 13:04.837
question each other, well, how come you were going so high in this?

13:04.897 --> 13:06.499
I mean, you don't know that much about them.

13:06.519 --> 13:21.600
And Forbes said to Perot, and Perot said, or Forbes, yeah, Perot said, well, I was watching you, and you know about manuscripts, and you kept on bidding, so I thought it's gotta be worth it, so I kept on bidding.

13:22.081 --> 13:26.647
And Forbes said, oh my God, the only reason I was bidding is because you were bidding.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.009
Now, how did you get the story?

13:28.765 --> 13:31.387
Uh, I think Steve Forbes told me.

13:31.587 --> 13:31.768
Really?

13:31.808 --> 13:32.848
So it's from the Forbes family?

13:32.868 --> 13:34.270
From the Forbes family, right, yeah.

13:34.290 --> 13:34.910
So it's pretty good.

13:34.930 --> 13:38.613
It might have been, I don't know, this had been years ago, so it might have been.

13:38.633 --> 13:42.417
Yeah, I'm sure it came either through the family or someone who was standing there.

13:42.457 --> 13:45.639
I wasn't standing there, but it could have been through Barnes, I think.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.140
Okay.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.603
If I use it, I just don't want it to be too apocryphal, that's all.

13:50.183 --> 13:52.525
Um, yes, I'm not sure.

13:52.585 --> 13:53.866
That's just the story I've got.

13:53.906 --> 13:55.428
That's why I asked where you got it.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.350
Um, unfortunately, I don't remember.

13:59.073 --> 14:02.736
But, yeah, you better check.

14:02.756 --> 14:06.059
See if Bart knows it and see if he has a response to that.

14:06.159 --> 14:07.000
It's a great story.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.981
Well, you could use, don't even use the names.

14:09.102 --> 14:10.963
Use two great manuscripts.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.144
Oh, I like the names.

14:12.164 --> 14:14.326
I think Parole is a pretty good name.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.108
Yeah, that's how it came to me.

14:16.408 --> 14:22.793
And I think Bart knows that version of it and whether or not it's... Do you have an Emancipation Proclamation?

14:22.813 --> 14:23.734
Yes, we do.

14:24.795 --> 14:28.438
In fact, here is a... I thought I'd bring that down.

14:29.262 --> 14:33.110
Inside, there's some writing about it.

14:33.311 --> 14:38.121
Do you have many of these things, things like this, reprints?

14:38.963 --> 14:40.746
Oh, brochures, you mean?

14:41.127 --> 14:42.490
No, not that many.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.314
I'll take as many as you've got.

14:44.334 --> 14:47.220
These are the only two I have here that help me.

14:47.639 --> 14:54.169
I don't have... So in the beginning, you said with a vengeance, it almost sounds like a feeding frenzy.

14:54.229 --> 14:56.212
Yes, like a feeding frenzy.

14:56.232 --> 15:02.441
We went out and we tried to purchase every single thing, kept on bidding no matter what.

15:02.642 --> 15:05.646
I think we bought every major document that came up for four years.

15:06.087 --> 15:06.367
Wow.

15:06.467 --> 15:07.168
Every single one.

15:08.210 --> 15:09.011
How about the focus?

15:09.051 --> 15:10.934
Was there a focus or just major documents?

15:10.954 --> 15:11.655
Just major.

15:11.675 --> 15:12.797
It's got to be very major.

15:12.837 --> 15:14.980
It's got to be something that a fifth grader would recognize.

15:15.365 --> 15:17.948
That was my key.

15:18.068 --> 15:24.276
If somebody in grade school would recognize it in their textbook, then it's certainly important.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.558
Who are you generally buying through?

15:25.578 --> 15:27.220
Bart in New York?

15:27.501 --> 15:27.681
No.

15:28.562 --> 15:30.384
Bart is our agent in New York.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.809
We have Pierre Beres in France.

15:33.869 --> 15:35.170
We have Richard Sawyer in London.

15:36.092 --> 15:41.779
Dorothy Sloan in Houston, in Austin.

15:42.940 --> 15:43.962
It's just different people.

15:43.982 --> 15:44.983
We have Tony

15:45.402 --> 16:10.785
uh tono tour gutierrez in mexico city we have uh breitfeld in argentina and you've gotten all these places oh yeah all of them we uh are quite active in at all times have you tried to start cataloging the collection well it's not yes it's on um it's on cards we have them on three to five cards and we have a

16:11.170 --> 16:12.452
a summary on computer.

16:12.492 --> 16:14.115
We can't do the whole computer thing.

16:14.135 --> 16:22.289
It would take a tremendous effort to put everything on computer, to actually out-describe each document on the computer, because we have over a million documents now.

16:22.730 --> 16:23.731
A million documents.

16:23.751 --> 16:24.172
A million documents.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.616
Do you have a sense of what these million documents are?

16:26.776 --> 16:27.558
Oh, absolutely.

16:28.018 --> 16:28.619
I can tell you.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.645
They're all here.

16:31.665 --> 16:33.668
My little computer.

16:34.559 --> 16:40.366
motivation, I guess, is that these things, these historic things, these great things are available.

16:40.386 --> 16:58.407
I guess I had a sense of history, which I was latent until I was older, but I was fascinated to see the document after Huntington, and then even more fascinated reading about, you know, it was certainly a, well, I'll tell you what, let me let you read

16:58.555 --> 17:00.698
You're going to let us see a few things, too, right?

17:00.858 --> 17:01.098
What?

17:01.118 --> 17:02.079
You're going to let us see a few?

17:02.099 --> 17:04.042
Sure, I'll bring down a few things.

17:04.222 --> 17:04.763
You can read that.

17:04.803 --> 17:05.483
It'll take a second.

17:05.544 --> 17:07.506
And this might answer the question, in fact.

17:07.586 --> 17:10.490
I'll shut this off for a second.

17:10.650 --> 17:14.014
The reason we're a few minutes late, by the way, is we got caught in that La Casa.

17:14.034 --> 17:14.454
That's okay.

17:14.474 --> 17:16.817
If you had called at 9, I'd have been ready and waiting.

17:16.837 --> 17:19.120
But if you don't call, I don't even remember.

17:19.420 --> 17:20.662
But I'm always here.

17:21.883 --> 17:23.145
Okay.

17:23.497 --> 17:32.026
One of the themes that will run through my book, and I think that you're fulfilling this splendidly, is that the collector is more than an accumulator.

17:32.646 --> 17:33.007
Oh, absolutely.

17:33.027 --> 17:43.718
The collector is responsible, and I will give cite documents, instances of where the collector preserves the product of human achievement.

17:43.738 --> 17:46.080
That's exactly right.

17:46.641 --> 17:48.042
And you're doing this.

17:48.062 --> 17:51.546
I might extend that one thing further, and that is that

17:51.998 --> 18:01.832
Usually the institutional or the governmental agencies who preserve documents are very, very lax in their preservation techniques.

18:01.852 --> 18:09.363
For example, the California archives, manuscript archives and printed archives, were stored in a basement which was known to flood.

18:11.025 --> 18:14.550
In San Francisco, I think it was, or maybe Sacramento, I forget which.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.773
And, in fact, it flooded, and most of it lost.

18:17.935 --> 18:18.816
Once again, where was this?

18:19.201 --> 18:46.896
in san francisco in california somewhere it's the california archives i'm not sure san francisco or the state archives right state archives our um secretary of state i believe is march or something like that recognized this problem and she just recently had a drive to create a new archives so that these things could be saved and uh that would be someone to talk to her that would be a real interesting point that

18:47.416 --> 18:47.917
March?

18:47.937 --> 18:49.819
Well, it's the Secretary of State, whoever named it.

18:49.879 --> 18:50.980
I think it's March Yufong.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.083
I'm not sure who it is.

18:54.124 --> 18:58.009
Yeah, you should always check on any of my stories, because I hear them from other people.

18:58.089 --> 19:00.212
I don't want to be the direct quote of anything.

19:00.232 --> 19:05.939
I have a sense that you probably believe that every piece of documentation is a precious thing.

19:06.139 --> 19:07.681
Absolutely.

19:07.721 --> 19:10.785
That really nothing should be destroyed if it's on paper.

19:11.686 --> 19:13.288
There's a lot of...

19:13.690 --> 19:16.995
The Huntington Library, for example, has a little different view.

19:17.035 --> 19:20.200
They think that every private piece of information should be saved.

19:20.721 --> 19:27.692
And indeed, most of their documents are private letters in Californian history back in the 1850s of everybody.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.037
And they have five million down there.

19:31.057 --> 19:41.233
But mostly, as far as I know, they are letters from John Doe or Jose Garcia or whatever from California.

19:41.551 --> 20:05.449
they then scholars can go there and read personal letters to get an idea of what happened in various parts that's really going farther than i wanted to go i wanted to stick with the with the monumental documents and fill in around them also and it is all manuscripts there are no printed books no there might be

20:05.699 --> 20:06.760
One or two here, there.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.662
Or a printed map or something.

20:08.682 --> 20:09.924
Yeah, but it's a collection.

20:09.944 --> 20:10.865
Oh, yeah.

20:10.885 --> 20:13.207
99.99% is manuscript, right?

20:13.267 --> 20:14.268
Unique material.

20:14.368 --> 20:16.110
Yes, and original material.

20:17.131 --> 20:19.414
Printed material would be a copy.

20:19.554 --> 20:23.679
Unique means a manuscript which exists only in one state.

20:24.219 --> 20:27.363
Yes, you should say one state.

20:27.703 --> 20:35.031
Many letters, for example, if George Washington was writing to Benjamin Franklin in Paris,

20:35.686 --> 20:37.149
He would write more than one.

20:37.189 --> 20:38.411
He'd write maybe three or four.

20:38.711 --> 20:42.658
And then he'd place one on each of three or four different ships.

20:43.139 --> 20:45.924
And only two of them would get there out of five, maybe.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.428
Because somehow people didn't do it.

20:48.468 --> 20:49.490
About mail at the time.

20:49.530 --> 20:54.258
Well, I don't know if they did that, but things got lost.

20:54.279 --> 20:55.180
Things got destroyed.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.424
So sometimes you'll find

20:57.708 --> 20:59.090
two copies of the same letter.

20:59.110 --> 21:01.513
Do you have multiple copies of the same letter?

21:01.574 --> 21:02.495
Very, very few.

21:02.515 --> 21:08.684
Once in a while we'll see a multiple copy of something, but that's very difficult.

21:08.704 --> 21:14.472
Usually most of them are destroyed, but I think once or twice we'll see multiple copies.

21:14.492 --> 21:17.997
Do you get a big kick out of getting something really exciting?

21:18.157 --> 21:19.159
Tell me about the feeling.

21:20.481 --> 21:26.449
Tell me if you could just tell us what, in your mind, are a few of the high spots in the collection.

21:27.121 --> 21:27.902
Okay, which one?

21:27.922 --> 21:29.844
You want me to tell you about the feeling or about the high spot?

21:29.864 --> 21:30.544
Tell me about anything.

21:31.045 --> 21:32.446
Tell me about the feeling and the high spot.

21:32.466 --> 21:33.387
Okay, don't listen to something.

21:33.407 --> 21:33.667
You don't.

21:33.928 --> 21:35.129
Please, no, she's the girl.

21:35.669 --> 21:42.456
I'm getting great documents is better than cotton candy, watermelon, and sex.

21:47.721 --> 21:47.881
Really?

21:48.501 --> 21:49.442
All at the same time.

21:49.462 --> 21:51.564
Or whatever.

21:51.684 --> 21:54.327
I'm sure everybody gets a kick out of a lot of things.

21:54.593 --> 21:57.797
And that's what it feels like to me.

21:57.817 --> 22:05.427
Just because you can feel, or you can feel the presence of these great men right there with you.

22:05.768 --> 22:06.709
I mean, this was the document.

22:06.729 --> 22:07.430
They were touching.

22:08.371 --> 22:14.740
We've got documents where we know their fingerprints are on them, but we've got documents where they spill the ink a bit, and their fingerprints are right there.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.180
We can see it.

22:15.681 --> 22:18.424
George III writing something, and there's fingerprints right there.

22:19.826 --> 22:24.212
And so you know that he was touching it, and his ideas are...

22:24.614 --> 22:30.340
on the paper too, which gives even a closer tie.

22:31.021 --> 22:42.334
Not only that, and the most important thing about manuscripts is the fact that when they wrote by hand, if they changed their mind about a certain idea, they would cross it out and write something else.

22:42.354 --> 22:49.642
And so you can look underneath the cross out, which is not too difficult, and you can see what they taught first, what their first idea was.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.587
Not only that, in some manuscripts, which are

22:54.820 --> 23:00.587
drafts, maybe they were changed before they were printed, or maybe there are several drafts.

23:00.707 --> 23:07.195
Maybe there's two drafts made, and the first draft, they left out a few things from the first draft, and the second, because they didn't think it would work out.

23:07.235 --> 23:08.136
There's a couple variants.

23:08.797 --> 23:09.558
Yeah, right.

23:09.798 --> 23:11.620
But you don't see that in books.

23:11.981 --> 23:16.866
From the printed copy, you don't see what they were thinking.

23:17.427 --> 23:24.135
As a good example of this, in the American Bill of Rights, there was the four

23:24.942 --> 23:26.104
Let's see, what was it?

23:26.124 --> 23:31.272
The First Amendment of the... It was free speech.

23:34.757 --> 23:36.820
Let me just take a... That's embarrassing.

23:36.921 --> 23:39.925
I should have... Okay.

23:39.965 --> 23:43.170
Guaranteed the natural... The First Amendment guaranteed the natural rights.

23:43.551 --> 23:45.874
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

23:50.101 --> 23:51.323
Yeah, if you remember it.

23:51.343 --> 23:52.304
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

23:52.324 --> 23:53.346
That's not what they wrote.

23:53.697 --> 23:57.221
Life, liberty, and that's exactly right.

23:57.241 --> 24:01.766
They said, life, liberty, possessing property, and the pursuit of happiness.

24:01.786 --> 24:05.370
The reason they changed it is because property was slavery, and Thomas Jefferson said, hey.

24:05.390 --> 24:05.811
Exactly.

24:05.831 --> 24:07.232
Well, gee, you know the whole thing.

24:07.472 --> 24:07.933
That's right.

24:08.153 --> 24:12.578
It wasn't Thomas Jefferson, I don't think it was.

24:13.499 --> 24:16.903
But someone else objected that if we put that in there, then...

24:17.137 --> 24:20.921
you're disturbing our right to enslave.

24:21.282 --> 24:21.622
Correct.

24:21.642 --> 24:22.283
That's right.

24:22.303 --> 24:23.885
So there's not only the three.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.046
Did you have all these?

24:25.807 --> 24:27.529
Yeah, well, this is the Bill of Rights.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.151
But you have that draft.

24:29.171 --> 24:29.771
Yeah.

24:30.012 --> 24:30.833
Where did you get that?

24:30.993 --> 24:34.297
Well, I guess there's three or four drafts.

24:34.317 --> 24:35.658
How many drafts do you have?

24:35.698 --> 24:37.000
We just have one.

24:37.881 --> 24:43.347
One of them was just found in the National Archives just recently, which was

24:43.580 --> 24:56.176
James Madison's own draft, and they were looking through his papers just in the last year, I think, or maybe two years, and they found the third draft of the Bill of Rights.

24:56.196 --> 25:05.948
There's also one that I know is in Virginia, which is the same draft as we have, because the Bill of Rights came up through all of the states.

25:06.068 --> 25:11.275
The states, after the Constitution was written, everybody said, okay, we need the Bill of Rights,

25:11.592 --> 25:41.430
we didn't want to put it into the Constitution because it would make it more difficult to approve it, but now, for the first ten amendments, here we go, everybody made their suggestions, but of course Virginia had a Bill of Rights which they had been using for 10 or 20 years for their own constitution for the state, and they had thought so much on it, they said, well, we know what to do, and they submitted their own ideas, and the...

25:42.220 --> 25:55.295
The Congress considered all the states' theories, but they eventually took 90% of the Virginian suggestions as the Bill of Rights.

25:55.315 --> 25:57.177
Are you a full-time collector now?

25:57.657 --> 26:00.260
No, half-time I still have to watch one of the tenants.

26:02.463 --> 26:04.465
I'm trying to become a full-time collector.

26:05.170 --> 26:06.612
a person in the library.

26:06.812 --> 26:09.797
Do you see yourself still as a collector or as an archivist?

26:10.798 --> 26:12.000
What do I see myself in?

26:12.020 --> 26:13.202
That's a good question.

26:13.242 --> 26:21.174
I certainly see myself as a collector, but I think of our exhibit halls as museums.

26:21.495 --> 26:22.696
Now, these are open to the public?

26:22.897 --> 26:23.117
Yes.

26:23.297 --> 26:24.379
Is this something we can look at?

26:24.539 --> 26:24.699
Yeah.

26:26.242 --> 26:33.152
One of them here in Montecito is open just four times a year, four weekends a year, plus special openings.

26:33.318 --> 26:34.700
And they have special exhibits.

26:34.741 --> 26:44.197
In fact, I am going to be giving you schedules for the last 10 years or so, which when you read it, you'll see exactly what we have also.

26:44.818 --> 26:46.401
You made a decision to share.

26:46.982 --> 26:47.503
Absolutely.

26:47.623 --> 26:51.310
I know a lot of collectors that don't even want you to know they exist.

26:51.644 --> 26:56.371
That's true, and that surprises me because nobody knows what good is it.

26:56.391 --> 27:02.080
Well, but then again, I think the manuscript and the book collector is a different creature from the art collector.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.702
Possibly, so.

27:04.303 --> 27:20.908
Well, have you ever thought of the Mona Lisa, if somehow someone stole it and said, you can have it for $1,000, and in a moment of who knows what, you bought it for $1,000,

27:21.800 --> 27:50.440
and but you know it's stolen and let's say they say they the prerequisite you can't give it back and you can't uh you can show it if you want but you can't give it back okay so all of a sudden here's your mona lisa and you've just heard a lot better than the phone say it cost you you had to sell your home to get it and you don't know why you got it because it's stolen but now you have it now the question is can you you can't show the whole world's what i mean you'd be

27:50.673 --> 27:54.620
I'm from jail for life, and they'll take it away, so you can't show it.

27:54.640 --> 27:59.829
You can put it up in your basement and maybe show it to your best friend, hoping they won't tell.

28:02.193 --> 28:03.215
What good is the Mona Lisa?

28:03.235 --> 28:05.539
Yeah, but somebody just stole a Vanier from Boston.

28:05.559 --> 28:06.762
Yes, but what good is it?

28:06.782 --> 28:08.685
They're going to get tired of it very fast.

28:09.206 --> 28:11.550
The only, if you think about that,

28:11.935 --> 28:15.301
You could have the Mona Lisa in your basement and it is worthless.

28:15.401 --> 28:16.643
It's no good to you even.

28:16.863 --> 28:22.352
I mean, looking at it... And it's really quite legitimately worthless because it's so valuable you can't sell it.

28:22.613 --> 28:23.374
You can't sell it.

28:23.494 --> 28:27.902
And even if you could sell it, no one's going to buy it because everybody knows it's... Nobody can't buy it.

28:27.922 --> 28:28.022
Yeah.

28:28.042 --> 28:32.289
And so having it down there is no good because you can't even tell anybody about it.

28:32.309 --> 28:33.751
So it's like it's not there at all.

28:33.811 --> 28:34.633
I mean, you can look at it.

28:34.653 --> 28:35.314
It's a big deal.

28:35.434 --> 28:37.858
It's like... It doesn't...

28:38.412 --> 28:41.415
The only value of that Van Mier or whatever it was.

28:41.435 --> 28:41.736
Van Mier.

28:41.816 --> 28:42.697
Van Mier, yeah.

28:42.817 --> 28:42.997
Sorry.

28:43.097 --> 28:43.998
And Rembrandt.

28:44.899 --> 28:49.284
The only value to those are going back to the original owner and Ransom.

28:49.304 --> 28:49.884
And Ransom.

28:50.084 --> 28:51.206
That's the only value.

28:51.226 --> 28:51.506
Okay.

28:51.586 --> 28:54.369
This is so good.

28:55.850 --> 29:01.957
I gather your artistic inclination, your collection, never was towards painting.

29:01.977 --> 29:03.939
No, I have nothing but art.

29:04.019 --> 29:06.782
Oh, these were, you know, these are just

29:07.252 --> 29:08.553
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

29:08.573 --> 29:09.595
I know nothing about ours.

29:09.715 --> 29:13.179
Now, did you build this house as part of the empire?

29:13.679 --> 29:15.121
No, this part of the house was here.

29:15.141 --> 29:16.302
I'll give you two in a second.

29:16.662 --> 29:21.408
But we added on a wing over there and a wing going down that way.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.270
So we added on two wings.

29:23.290 --> 29:25.632
Excuse me one second.

29:25.652 --> 29:25.753
Okay.

29:25.773 --> 29:31.759
Why bring her along in case we... Now, you were a teacher.

29:32.200 --> 29:32.500
Yes.

29:33.020 --> 29:35.464
And while you're not a teacher... Throughout this whole thing, I was a teacher.

29:35.544 --> 29:39.089
One way or the other, I would always have a course that I was teaching.

29:39.750 --> 29:49.024
While I was at UNIVAC in Minnesota, I was a graduate teacher taking courses and teaching at the University of Minnesota.

29:49.705 --> 29:56.334
In San Diego, I taught for, I believe, actually, what did I teach for down there?

29:56.495 --> 29:58.858
Goodness, I forget.

29:59.328 --> 30:02.171
Oh, at USC Extension.

30:02.271 --> 30:13.363
I taught a course at USC Extension, plus I was, with UNIVAC, I became the training supervisor with the Navy, between the Navy and UNIVAC.

30:13.383 --> 30:21.713
Then when we came up here, I taught at one course at Westmont College, which is a college, plus Santa Barbara City College.

30:22.173 --> 30:27.019
I taught for several years there, and also the... This is Mathematics.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.301
Yeah, all Mathematics, yeah.

30:30.057 --> 30:34.621
But she suggests that maybe sharing the collection the way you do is a way of giving back.

30:35.602 --> 30:36.963
It's definitely a way of giving back.

30:37.023 --> 30:50.155
I mean, the idea from the profits we made out of real estate, we feel that we should give back something somehow, and this is one way of doing it.

30:50.175 --> 30:53.078
I want to be discreet, but I gather the profits were terrific.

30:53.098 --> 30:58.763
We used to buy houses at $10,000 and $12,000 a piece.

30:58.783 --> 30:59.203
Now that we're

30:59.639 --> 31:00.180
250,000.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.603
You mean buying?

31:03.464 --> 31:04.886
That's the value of each of the houses.

31:04.926 --> 31:06.127
So they've gone up from 10,000.

31:06.167 --> 31:08.530
They've gone up 20-fold.

31:09.011 --> 31:09.472
Wow.

31:09.752 --> 31:10.413
In 20 years.

31:10.673 --> 31:11.134
In 20 years.

31:11.154 --> 31:13.237
Now, of course, we didn't buy them all back 20 years ago.

31:13.277 --> 31:16.260
Some, we were buying under 220,000, too.

31:16.581 --> 31:20.005
And so those, we had no property.

31:20.025 --> 31:22.468
Lately, for the past several years, we haven't purchased anything.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.651
But they went up enormously.

31:24.731 --> 31:27.094
And while they were going up, I was buying them as fast as I could.

31:27.174 --> 31:29.157
I mean, I couldn't buy them any faster if

31:29.558 --> 31:32.581
If I would, I would have bought them faster because I knew where they were going.

31:34.403 --> 31:40.350
People thought when they went up from 10 to 15,000 people, I'd say, God, that's 50% increase.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.292
Anybody buys that, they're going to go back to 10.

31:42.312 --> 31:46.336
You're going to lose 50% of your investment on every one you buy.

31:47.077 --> 31:49.860
And yet my figure showed I was an acquisition.

31:49.900 --> 31:57.068
So I actually could get an idea of supply and demand and the number of people coming up as baby boomers.

31:57.537 --> 32:00.601
And I think it showed that it was up to $175,000.

32:01.262 --> 32:04.666
And so at $15,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, I was just buying.

32:04.787 --> 32:07.110
I knew this was cheap compared.

32:07.130 --> 32:10.474
But you know, you have to be able to handle it.

32:10.494 --> 32:11.255
You know, you can't do it.

32:11.395 --> 32:13.598
I should have actually hired other people.

32:13.718 --> 32:22.310
Can you give you an idea, if you want to or if you don't want to, what you gave into the collection?

32:24.052 --> 32:26.295
That would be difficult.

32:27.305 --> 32:28.186
I sort of know.

32:28.206 --> 32:29.509
That's fine.

32:29.589 --> 32:31.993
I respect that.

32:32.854 --> 32:40.026
Everything I touch in that respect is... I mean, real estate or manuscript seems to do very well.

32:40.486 --> 32:45.134
When I, for the first four years, as I said... What were those four years, by the way?

32:45.294 --> 32:50.302
79 or 80 to 84, something like that.

32:51.024 --> 32:51.945
Then all of a sudden...

32:52.398 --> 32:56.063
All of these countries decided that they have been making mistakes.

32:56.083 --> 33:04.315
Rather than keeping the first edition, you know, when they print up the Declaration of Independence, the first one comes off the press as the main copy.

33:04.996 --> 33:07.640
And then they throw away the draft back to the owner or whatever.

33:07.680 --> 33:12.487
And so they realized they had made mistakes just a few years ago.

33:12.527 --> 33:15.011
This is not a hundred years ago.

33:15.151 --> 33:20.599
And so they, everybody was trying to get, also universities have,

33:20.849 --> 33:34.501
when they wanted to raise money for a building, or when a museum wanted to raise money, they would sell, to buy a painting, they'd all sell manuscripts, because they knew they could buy an equal manuscript later, evidently.

33:34.681 --> 33:38.664
I don't know why they would sell a manuscript, but they felt they were like money.

33:39.245 --> 33:43.869
So they'd sell some, a couple years later, buy some back, so they'd have some great manuscripts.

33:43.889 --> 33:49.894
Well, after the four years, they realized that they were going out, but there wasn't anything coming back in.

33:50.279 --> 33:58.806
And so they raised their sights a bit, and of course we did too, and then all of a sudden it just exploded, and that was crazy, just like the houses.

33:58.826 --> 34:03.871
Now some young guy might come along and say, gee, that should be in the National Archives.

34:03.891 --> 34:05.652
How come that's here in the public?

34:05.953 --> 34:08.055
It's only $5 million.

34:08.135 --> 34:11.518
How come in these lives that's worth $20 million?

34:12.198 --> 34:19.965
But things that were selling for $40,000 or even $100,000 are selling for a million, two millions.

34:20.502 --> 34:47.168
it's gone the same routes as i don't know if that was inflation like how did this oracle was the realization now the market these things have taken off yeah and especially manuscripts but uh i gather that as a collector it's not like you know the mindset isn't i'm looking to get something at a good price your mindset is i'm looking to get something

34:47.249 --> 35:15.754
i'm definitely looking and i'm willing and i'm not willing to pay whatever i have to pay almost to a degree there are some dealers out there that you don't want to know that say that you don't want to give them a blank check that's right because they will just say okay instead of 100 000 100 million i don't have that kind of money oh 170 000 let's say oh well i mean that's you know but they would no then these guys go 10 100 times and then

35:16.139 --> 35:21.304
then say, well, how close to 100 million, I mean, they would, you know, I doubt one fell spoof if it's that great.

35:21.664 --> 35:25.348
And so you have to actually, because you have to turn down things.

35:25.368 --> 35:45.808
Although I didn't for the first four years, but in the last four years, if I felt, unless they were unbelievable things, but if they're really great items, but they are not the end of the world things, you have to turn them down sometimes to keep these people from

35:46.126 --> 35:48.168
raising their price every time they talk to you.

35:49.289 --> 35:53.693
Because eventually they will want the entire national debt for one thing.

35:55.395 --> 35:57.397
And there's only a couple of guys like that.

35:57.617 --> 36:05.165
Most of the dealers that get involved in this, and Sotheby's and Christie's are in trouble.

36:05.905 --> 36:07.327
They're not too hard either.

36:07.347 --> 36:09.189
They try to push up the prices.

36:10.230 --> 36:12.792
You know, it's said, well, who knows?

36:13.632 --> 36:17.115
But there are ways to push up prices, certainly, aren't there?

36:17.135 --> 36:17.576
Oh, absolutely.

36:17.616 --> 36:19.918
They know they've got certain left bids there.

36:21.479 --> 36:27.304
Well, Sotheby's comes out, and they put an estimate on something, and it's ten times what it sold for three years ago.

36:27.324 --> 36:28.185
Now, how do they know that?

36:28.305 --> 36:32.829
I mean, do they toss them and find out that someone would pay ten times as much?

36:32.909 --> 36:34.310
Why are they guessing?

36:34.751 --> 36:36.913
And in many cases, they're right.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.435
But that's probably one of the worst at pushing up.

36:39.455 --> 36:41.357
But there's a couple of dealers that are even worse.

36:41.537 --> 36:41.817
Yeah.

36:41.982 --> 36:54.072
My wife is noticing here also that you collect great authors, scientists, philosophers, statesmen, sovereigns, leaders, pardon me, from all the periods of world history.

36:54.092 --> 36:59.457
So you just say, if it's significant, I want it.

37:00.638 --> 37:11.567
And of course, if you get bored and you can't find something that a fifth grader recognizes, then you can get a little more deeper into history.

37:11.682 --> 37:12.543
How about literature?

37:12.964 --> 37:15.688
Do you have holographic manuscripts and writings?

37:15.708 --> 37:18.312
Yes, you name the writings.

37:18.332 --> 37:18.732
Hopefully.

37:18.892 --> 37:20.254
Yeah, we've got Steinbeck.

37:20.835 --> 37:31.210
You know, he just came out, he did, his wife just came out with a book that he had written called The Acts of

37:32.202 --> 37:33.683
King Arthur and his Noble Knights.

37:33.824 --> 37:35.325
Just published, yeah, that's right.

37:35.385 --> 37:39.689
Just published, yeah, which was his main thing in his whole life.

37:39.709 --> 37:45.294
He loved King Arthur, and he had written his book, and it hadn't been published before, and his wife had the manuscript.

37:45.314 --> 37:47.957
And so he just came out with that, and we have that manuscript.

37:47.977 --> 37:49.458
He bought that privately, or?

37:49.498 --> 37:55.664
He bought that from the wife through a New York dealer, a fellow named Fleming.

37:55.684 --> 37:56.645
The late John Foreman.

37:56.825 --> 37:58.427
The late John Foreman, yeah.

37:58.447 --> 37:59.528
Success at the Rosenbach.

37:59.548 --> 38:01.770
Yes, exactly, yeah.

38:02.729 --> 38:04.531
And we have four or five other.

38:05.112 --> 38:05.493
Hemingway?

38:07.055 --> 38:08.958
Hemingway, I'm not sure what I have, but Hemingway.

38:08.978 --> 38:12.803
He's not one of my favorites, but I'm sure I have one of his favorites.

38:13.103 --> 38:14.065
But he's a top favorite.

38:14.265 --> 38:17.569
He's a good one, he's a good one, he's a good one, he's a good one, he's a good one.

38:17.650 --> 38:20.393
I don't know, I've seen... How long in Sacramento that's got a pretty good... Hemingway collection, I guess.

38:20.634 --> 38:25.260
Every auction seems to have a hundred of these things, so they're so...

38:25.527 --> 38:26.768
Maybe mostly letters.

38:26.889 --> 38:28.190
I don't see too many manuscripts.

38:28.210 --> 38:29.291
No, manuscripts are tough.

38:29.311 --> 38:31.995
There are only nine novels anyway.

38:33.016 --> 38:35.239
But I haven't gone much for him because he seemed so common.

38:35.299 --> 38:36.840
I didn't want to get involved.

38:36.860 --> 38:38.863
But I think I have some things.

38:39.083 --> 38:39.724
I'm not sure.

38:39.744 --> 38:42.307
You were going to tell me some of your high spots.

38:42.327 --> 38:43.929
What to you are high spots.

38:43.949 --> 38:44.049
Okay.

38:44.109 --> 38:45.310
What to me are high spots.

38:45.371 --> 38:46.892
Goodness, that's difficult.

38:47.633 --> 38:54.201
Well, in the next year, I'm trying to just think what we're going to be showing the next year at the museum.

38:55.160 --> 39:05.073
Next year, 1992, of course, is the 500th anniversary of the Discovery of America.

39:05.614 --> 39:13.325
Now, Columbus manuscripts are illegal to own, evidently, because if they export them from Spain or Italy, I think it's for death penalty.

39:13.345 --> 39:20.374
So, nobody wants to... Except that there are Columbus manuscripts from the Great Museum, which is a lot of... Very few.

39:20.434 --> 39:23.158
There are letters, and the discovery...

39:23.780 --> 39:52.993
or something like that so there's not too many and a couple of the uh the diary things there's a couple families that have multiple letters in a couple of museums very very cute however um so most of the exhibits will not have a original cum performance letter uh but we do have probably the closest thing to that we have a letter from pertinent and isabella uh relaying to the pope

39:53.446 --> 39:59.251
their ownership of the new world after Columbus just got back from his voyage.

39:59.511 --> 40:02.574
Yeah, that's one of my wife's favorites.

40:02.654 --> 40:04.255
You got that at auction?

40:04.275 --> 40:07.258
No, we bought that from a fellow named Krauts.

40:07.999 --> 40:08.599
Hans Peet.

40:08.899 --> 40:11.081
Hans Peet, yeah.

40:11.181 --> 40:12.302
From Hans himself or his wife?

40:12.382 --> 40:12.943
Well, no.

40:13.183 --> 40:15.765
Yeah, from himself.

40:15.785 --> 40:19.509
A couple of years, not that long, maybe two years.

40:19.709 --> 40:19.929
Yeah.

40:20.309 --> 40:23.352
Just before I started, which was a shame because

40:23.635 --> 40:25.938
He was the greatest living bookseller, no question.

40:25.958 --> 40:29.883
He was definitely not a manuscript man, but a bookseller.

40:29.903 --> 40:32.566
Well, I mean, we use bookseller generically.

40:32.626 --> 40:40.836
I mean, I think it embraces... There's a little... They're different, but... I mean, John Fleming, for instance, dealt with everything.

40:40.956 --> 40:41.737
He's a bookseller, too.

40:41.817 --> 40:43.979
Dr. Rosenbach dealt with everything.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.702
But Rosenbach was half-half.

40:45.722 --> 40:47.524
He was half manuscript, half bookseller.

40:47.544 --> 40:49.005
We had 30 manuscript.

40:49.126 --> 40:51.128
See, Fleming and Sprout...

40:51.918 --> 40:53.140
I mean, they had great books.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.063
So we got that privately through Krauss.

40:55.403 --> 40:56.725
Through Krauss, yeah.

40:57.446 --> 40:59.970
And the price was fair.

40:59.990 --> 41:04.116
$60,000 or $70,000 at the time.

41:04.136 --> 41:06.219
That's pretty damn nice.

41:06.459 --> 41:09.944
I saw a young kid that was cheap at the time, and that was 15 years old.

41:09.964 --> 41:11.627
I saw a kid at the Bradley Martin sale.

41:11.687 --> 41:17.475
A kid, 22 years old, spent $28,000 for an ascribed copy of Tarzan.

41:17.495 --> 41:19.258
Do you know what the kid's name was?

41:19.677 --> 41:20.618
I've got it written down.

41:20.818 --> 41:21.940
Not Joe Magdalena.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.862
No, Joe Magdalena's a dealer.

41:24.042 --> 41:25.824
Well, I thought maybe that's the kid.

41:26.465 --> 41:27.907
That kid spent $450.

41:28.127 --> 41:33.934
No, this was a kid, a collector, and he was with the dealer, and I spotted him.

41:34.515 --> 41:36.677
I don't know where the kid got the money.

41:36.738 --> 41:38.880
That's the top family money.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.923
He had a small inheritance.

41:41.103 --> 41:43.145
He spent $100,000 at the sale.

41:43.165 --> 41:47.651
This might have been, do you think, did he say, no, he hadn't been with him this thing.

41:47.751 --> 41:49.633
He sat with a dealer, the dealer bought for him.

41:49.883 --> 41:50.764
Okay.

41:52.246 --> 41:56.230
I can use his name, but it's in a notebook, and you'd better have it with me.

41:56.490 --> 41:57.371
I'll call you in.

41:57.491 --> 42:02.356
Well, this kid is probably smarter than most of us because these things are still.

42:02.376 --> 42:03.277
He's investing in his life.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.719
Yeah, he's taking the money.

42:05.019 --> 42:15.030
Well, I think, and even in my mind, when you look at everything as an investment, even though there's no possibility we will ever divest ourselves of any of these,

42:15.803 --> 42:16.744
No possibility?

42:16.864 --> 42:17.785
No possibility.

42:17.805 --> 42:24.031
Well, we're going to endow the libraries, or the museums, and no more in favor.

42:24.972 --> 42:36.002
And part of the trust that we have set up for the libraries requires that even these manuscripts, the major manuscripts, and we say all of them because we can't specify which one, cannot be told any.

42:37.063 --> 42:41.507
This is like a Hutchington Trust in progress.

42:41.767 --> 42:42.989
A gestation, right?

42:43.269 --> 42:45.591
Yeah, exactly.

42:45.773 --> 43:14.751
uh people's wishes over the years yeah that's right you're really going to you're really going to stipulate quite definitely that none of this stuff can be that's fine but you have to make sure that they have plenty of money to make that's exact that's the advantage we are going to also have half of our states those are our state goes to our children and the other half goes to the library and being a mathematician i have instructed them exactly

43:15.102 --> 43:16.824
how they can spend this money.

43:16.964 --> 43:29.279
And the money will be, I believe it's only 50% of the money can be used to maintain the libraries and to buy new, first of all, maintain the library.

43:29.299 --> 43:34.986
You have to do all the expenses that are, that have to be paid.

43:35.186 --> 43:37.469
And then with the rest, they can buy new manuscripts.

43:38.810 --> 43:41.333
And with half of it, they can't touch it.

43:41.373 --> 43:43.776
They have to have it in a very,

43:44.667 --> 43:49.693
secure, very, very secure, maybe low interest, doesn't make any difference.

43:49.853 --> 43:59.144
Investment, such as a bank or bonds or some savings bonds or something like it, United States bonds, half of it cannot ever be touched.

44:00.325 --> 44:05.631
Now, if you start thinking about that, that means half the money is going to make money.

44:05.651 --> 44:13.020
And, of course, for the first 10, 15, 20, 50 years, big deal, it's going to make interest.

44:13.692 --> 44:18.298
But do you realize what a million dollars is if you have it for 400 years?

44:18.318 --> 44:20.661
That's more money than there is in the United States.

44:20.681 --> 44:24.005
Except that Huntington left six million or whatever, and that's not enough, they say.

44:24.586 --> 44:29.272
Okay, but they left six million, but I think they used most of it, too, or something.

44:29.292 --> 44:29.773
I don't know.

44:29.853 --> 44:31.655
And then they're trying to charge admission.

44:32.016 --> 44:36.422
Everything's going to be free, but we also... That's stipulated, too.

44:36.442 --> 44:37.523
It always has to be free.

44:37.807 --> 44:41.912
But the key is that he didn't set up a program.

44:41.932 --> 44:44.435
What a good story, by the way.

44:44.695 --> 44:53.126
Every 20 years, that money is going to be 1,600% more than we put in.

44:53.206 --> 44:59.914
If we put in a million dollars, for every million we put in, every 20 years, it'll be worth 16 million.

44:59.934 --> 45:01.736
Or every 16 years, it'll be 20 million.

45:01.816 --> 45:03.338
Let's say 20 years.

45:03.398 --> 45:07.543
Every 20 years, it'll be 16, unless interest rates drop.

45:08.047 --> 45:08.948
you know, considerably.

45:09.669 --> 45:17.356
But if you invest in mortgages, for example, which is good, bonds, mortgages, whatever, you know, give it to people like savings loans do.

45:17.376 --> 45:20.319
Give it to people as first trustees on their house.

45:20.339 --> 45:24.043
Even if the house goes down value, so you take back value, it's still worth something.

45:25.124 --> 45:28.487
And if the economy shrinks and the money shrinks, that's okay.

45:28.527 --> 45:32.311
Just so you don't lose, don't invest in something that disappears.

45:33.412 --> 45:34.273
If you put it in

45:34.945 --> 45:38.449
to a second trustee where the value of the house goes below and you lose everything, that's bad.

45:38.489 --> 45:47.298
But if you put it in a secure item, it will, even if the value goes down, it's still the principal should be there a portion of it.

45:47.318 --> 45:53.324
At any rate, every 16 years, or every 20 years, it'll be 16, a million, every million will be 16 million.

45:54.125 --> 45:54.485
16.

45:54.505 --> 45:55.606
16 million.

45:56.427 --> 46:04.075
And therefore, in 40 years, it'll be 256 million.

46:05.067 --> 46:19.720
In 80 years, every time, by the time a couple hundred years passes, which of course is like thinking back into the 1700s now, which is a long, long time, but it will be multi-trillions of dollars.

46:19.740 --> 46:22.683
And so they will have so much money, and yet they won't be able to spend it.

46:22.743 --> 46:31.171
I mean, if they obey the wishes of God, it'll be the richest museum in the world.

46:31.251 --> 46:33.353
It'll make Getty look like a piker.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.742
But at some point, don't you want them to be able to spend the money?

46:36.962 --> 46:37.223
No.

46:38.844 --> 46:44.129
They'll be able to spend half of it at any time, and they can use half of it to create more, too.

46:44.209 --> 46:46.851
Doesn't the government require that you have to spend a percentage?

46:47.151 --> 46:47.652
I don't know.

46:47.672 --> 46:50.895
I saw this in the Getty Trust, by the way.

46:50.915 --> 46:51.775
I've got the paperwork.

46:51.795 --> 46:54.698
Well, I remember Getty is required to spend some money.

46:54.718 --> 46:56.059
I don't know why, though.

46:56.079 --> 46:59.922
Because the law requires that they have to spend a minimum of 4.5%.

47:00.103 --> 47:02.184
Okay, well, I'm saying 50%.

47:02.685 --> 47:02.985
Okay.

47:03.438 --> 47:05.020
Certainly within the limits.

47:06.643 --> 47:07.324
You're a young man.

47:07.384 --> 47:10.428
Is this for the future?

47:10.508 --> 47:14.574
It's after I pass away.

47:14.594 --> 47:19.822
It's a living trust type situation where it starts with both my wife and I disappear.

47:19.842 --> 47:21.805
But the paperwork is in place.

47:21.905 --> 47:23.728
Oh, it's there.

47:23.848 --> 47:30.178
Already in place.

47:30.198 --> 47:30.778
Not really.

47:30.859 --> 47:33.242
All four of our kids don't seem to have

47:33.863 --> 47:35.626
any passion for this at all.

47:35.806 --> 47:37.609
But your wife shares a passion.

47:37.629 --> 47:37.829
Yes.

47:38.610 --> 47:39.131
That's unusual.

47:39.211 --> 47:43.418
She, well, she looks and she shares in a different respect.

47:43.558 --> 47:46.001
She's more a social person.

47:46.903 --> 47:48.525
Like most women, excuse me.

47:48.545 --> 47:49.126
There she is.

47:49.146 --> 47:49.707
We'll ask her.

47:49.727 --> 47:52.431
I think she heard that, so she's coming.

47:53.072 --> 47:56.217
And so she handles a different aspect of it.

47:56.237 --> 47:58.761
She doesn't delve through the... This is Marcia.

47:58.921 --> 48:02.807
Hi, how are you?

48:03.209 --> 48:04.230
Doing a little interview.

48:04.490 --> 48:05.291
Oh, are you?

48:05.311 --> 48:05.952
Really?

48:06.132 --> 48:08.194
Oh, you've got to go.

48:08.974 --> 48:18.703
What do you think of your husband's... Has he done Quixote or is he... I noticed you have a Quixote in there for you.

48:18.723 --> 48:19.364
That's interesting.

48:19.384 --> 48:23.347
That's an interesting question.

48:23.448 --> 48:25.970
Actually, we're just talking about you.

48:26.150 --> 48:29.893
Where are you from?

48:29.913 --> 48:31.615
How many have you used?

48:31.635 --> 48:32.676
We're from Massachusetts.

48:32.707 --> 48:34.369
And what do you recognize?

48:34.389 --> 48:34.889
I'm a writer.

48:34.929 --> 48:37.592
I'll shut this up.

48:37.632 --> 48:39.914
The title of the book is A Gentle Madness.

48:40.655 --> 48:41.816
A Gentle Madness.

48:41.896 --> 48:44.779
And it's derivative of a man named Isaiah Thomas.

48:44.799 --> 48:47.842
Not unlike yourself, I see resonant themes.

48:48.162 --> 48:50.324
He was a printer in Massachusetts, made a fortune.

48:51.285 --> 48:55.649
He was the most prominent printer in the United States.

48:55.669 --> 48:59.693
And he wrote a book which is still in print, The History of Printing of North America.

49:00.500 --> 49:06.570
he researched manuscripts of Fenler and basically his collection became the American Antiquarian Society.

49:06.750 --> 49:07.792
Oh, yes.

49:07.812 --> 49:11.678
Which is, I mean, he founded it, mainly the Holocaust's collection.

49:11.698 --> 49:16.826
They have one of the two printed copies of the ratification of the Benedict.

49:16.846 --> 49:17.527
Who has the other?

49:17.567 --> 49:17.848
We do.

49:18.309 --> 49:22.896
And when he died, his grandsons wrote in a tribute

49:23.332 --> 49:28.880
My grandfather was afflicted with the gentlest of infirmities.

49:29.881 --> 49:30.942
So I derived that.

49:31.383 --> 49:34.788
I think there's a book called Auction Madness.

49:34.848 --> 49:36.149
Yes, I've talked to him.

49:36.169 --> 49:37.671
It's a scurrilous book.

49:38.332 --> 49:39.594
Yes.

49:40.375 --> 49:41.717
Charles Hamilton's book.

49:41.737 --> 49:44.521
Oh, is it Charles Hamilton?

49:44.661 --> 49:45.122
I don't know.

49:45.202 --> 49:47.124
I just remember the book.

49:47.244 --> 49:49.648
I didn't remember that he wrote it.

49:49.788 --> 49:51.330
He's the autographed guy in New York.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.943
was the autographed guy in the art trilogy.

49:54.183 --> 49:54.904
Sure.

49:54.924 --> 49:57.447
Do you have a deal with Cameron Dell up in the... Oh, absolutely.

49:58.168 --> 49:58.388
Absolutely.

49:58.528 --> 50:03.294
He is certainly a major adjunct to the manuscript world.

50:03.495 --> 50:03.935
He's good.

50:03.955 --> 50:05.036
I guess.

50:06.558 --> 50:09.462
He's a weird fellow.

50:10.163 --> 50:17.452
He would like to think of himself as the number one manuscript person in the world.

50:18.373 --> 50:20.035
And indeed, for a while,

50:20.335 --> 50:25.824
He was close to it, if not the number one manuscript dealer in the world.

50:27.146 --> 50:38.303
As far as being the number one expert, I don't think he can... He likes to think that, but he is... He needs a lot more education, I think.

50:38.323 --> 50:39.565
He's a young guy, though.

50:39.585 --> 50:43.010
He's a young guy, and I don't think he's going to go to try to learn any of these things.

50:43.871 --> 50:47.818
When they had these Mormon... Don't ask him about the Hoffman stuff.

50:47.838 --> 50:48.098
Yeah.

50:48.533 --> 50:58.888
He claimed to authenticate certain things, and the FBI, if you read the book, the FBI eventually states in there, my God, this guy doesn't know a damn thing.

50:59.489 --> 51:07.840
Talking about Rendell, when he was testifying, he was just saying, the guy's a manuscript person, he can look at a manuscript and say, yeah, it looks genuine, that's all he is.

51:07.860 --> 51:14.730
He doesn't know anything about, he doesn't know much about ink, he doesn't know much about paper, he doesn't know much about handwriting, really.

51:16.032 --> 51:18.135
But he, on the other hand, is a,

51:18.875 --> 51:22.219
was probably one of the most important dealers, yeah.

51:22.259 --> 51:23.080
Sort of faded out.

51:23.100 --> 51:25.023
Who has surpassed him any of you?

51:25.043 --> 51:26.545
Well, it's hard to say.

51:26.605 --> 51:34.835
Right now, believe it or not, the kid, Joe Magdalena, is probably the most... He's about 23 years old.

51:35.376 --> 51:37.238
Well, he's got people in back.

51:37.678 --> 51:42.244
I'm not even sure he knew anything about manuscripts.

51:42.404 --> 51:47.090
There must be a manuscript dealer behind him who was secretly doing this.

51:47.110 --> 51:47.751
I don't know who.

51:48.642 --> 51:50.404
I see him at the auction.

51:50.484 --> 51:52.947
I was wearing a T-shirt.

51:53.007 --> 51:54.669
I filled a hole in the notebook.

51:54.749 --> 51:56.491
I said, T-shirt just bid $100,000.

51:57.332 --> 51:58.834
Who is this kid in a T-shirt?

51:59.194 --> 52:01.236
Finally, I went up and introduced myself.

52:01.276 --> 52:02.618
He gave me his card.

52:02.638 --> 52:07.664
Yes, he's got big money of another real estate person behind him.

52:07.684 --> 52:08.705
Beverly Hills.

52:08.785 --> 52:10.127
He's in Beverly Hills, right.

52:10.167 --> 52:12.169
Now, he's one of the great ones.

52:12.189 --> 52:15.713
There are some, I don't know if there's any real leader at the moment.

52:16.250 --> 52:17.111
Well, that's good to do.

52:17.151 --> 52:20.654
Rendell was at one time, but it depends on how you're dealing.

52:20.674 --> 52:27.480
Rendell was dealing several years ago, and his prices were reasonable.

52:28.841 --> 52:36.367
And if you get greedy and try to raise them so that you have no more customers, then you disappear from being a manuscript dealer, almost.

52:36.387 --> 52:38.229
And Rendell has done that recently.

52:38.249 --> 52:39.930
Do you think he's priced himself out of the market?

52:40.731 --> 52:45.295
I think so, and he's stopped buying.

52:45.798 --> 52:48.881
and he's raised the prices on everything to where no one would buy it.

52:50.082 --> 52:51.664
I think Rendell's a collector also.

52:52.044 --> 52:54.186
He's got a secret collection.

52:54.226 --> 52:54.887
He showed it to me.

52:54.987 --> 52:56.529
Oh, he did.

52:56.549 --> 52:57.390
Which is normally good.

52:57.770 --> 53:07.220
I would a hundred times rather talk to a dealer who's a collector because he really knows what's good and who knows, maybe he'll sell one of his collections.

53:07.740 --> 53:14.607
But his collections are focused on areas that he's kind of about to be dealing in.

53:15.076 --> 53:18.860
which is kind of legitimate, which is legitimate, I believe.

53:18.960 --> 53:26.407
Rendell, if he wanted to, could, within two or three weeks, turn himself around and become the greatest theater in the world.

53:26.467 --> 53:35.036
I mean, if he wanted to, he could somehow go around, spend a lot of money, buy a lot of great manuscripts, and put out catalogs again.

53:35.096 --> 53:36.537
I haven't seen catalogs from him.

53:36.557 --> 53:39.820
I mean, instead of one every couple of months, I'd barely see one a year.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.582
He's moving, or has just moved through?

53:41.622 --> 53:43.564
He just moved.

53:43.865 --> 53:47.364
It had a beautiful place, but I don't know why I knew it.

53:47.425 --> 53:49.858
I'm going to put this on the other side before I run it out.
