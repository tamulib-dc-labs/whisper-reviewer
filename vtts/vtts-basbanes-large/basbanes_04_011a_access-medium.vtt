WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:05.141
is rolling now, and we're talking to Alice Schreier.

00:06.303 --> 00:20.684
So I guess the first question would be, you know, we hear all about the paradigm shift and the greater reliance on electronic stuff and the lesser reliance on printed books.

00:20.784 --> 00:24.950
In your view, do books still matter in institutions and institutional libraries?

00:25.350 --> 00:30.578
Well, I think in the...

00:30.811 --> 00:34.399
In the largest sense, they certainly do.

00:35.942 --> 00:48.870
I think it's very clear that research libraries are not only continuing to buy books and will continue to do so for a good time to come,

00:49.002 --> 01:08.935
those of us who work in great research libraries are also aware that we have extraordinary collections that we have a continuing responsibility to preserve and they will have an enduring importance as

01:09.438 --> 01:33.218
not only the materials for things that will be selected for future digitization, but also as the documentation of the past and the way that books were produced and have their own artifactual value above and beyond the content that may be digitized.

01:33.198 --> 01:47.423
So it's both the content for future digitization and also the artifacts of book culture that we need to continue to preserve in their original form in a very selective way.

01:47.443 --> 01:49.907
And that's a real challenge because we can't do it all.

01:49.887 --> 01:56.398
Now, you're familiar, of course, with Cornell, which has been kind of out front in a lot of these areas.

01:57.861 --> 02:08.539
They actually have done some work with using digitization as a form of preservation, and specifically in the area of some books.

02:08.699 --> 02:13.347
I think that at this point, nobody is...

02:13.327 --> 02:21.778
considering digitization a preservation medium except insofar as it reduces the need to handle fragile originals.

02:22.720 --> 02:37.900
We already know enough about the digital medium to know that it has its own preservation issues, and archiving things in digital form is yet another challenge that the digital age has brought us.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.517
And has not resolved.

02:39.537 --> 02:40.558
No, not at all.

02:41.019 --> 03:05.102
So I think that it can be said that there is a preservation component to making a decision to create a digital surrogate, because by doing that, you are enabling its use by a far wider audience and reducing the wear and tear on the original.

03:05.555 --> 03:22.338
But in no way does that solve the problem of preserving the original or, in fact, of having a digital surrogate into the future unless you continue to think about what that requires.

03:22.698 --> 03:26.984
What's the attitude of your university on the matter of deaccessioning books?

03:29.027 --> 03:32.271
Well, we...

03:33.668 --> 03:35.352
Let me think about that for a minute.

03:37.477 --> 03:48.422
We certainly view ourselves as a research library that is building a collection not only for present research needs, but looking ahead to the future.

03:48.482 --> 03:52.892
And while there are

03:53.783 --> 04:11.590
Certainly volumes that are deaccessioned, an example might be a reserve book that was purchased in multiple copies for course reserve, and so we decide at a certain point in time

04:11.924 --> 04:17.390
We don't need 15 copies of that title, you know, but we might keep one or two.

04:18.632 --> 04:35.552
We deaccession assuming that there are no donor or other requirements to the contrary materials that we can improve if we get a better copy of something.

04:36.123 --> 04:44.036
We get a gift that has in it a copy that's in better physical condition or more complete.

04:45.259 --> 04:50.888
And we take a very, very conservative view toward sort of defining a duplicate.

04:51.770 --> 04:59.042
But if one copy is in physical disrepair or...

05:00.389 --> 05:05.195
incomplete and we get a better copy, we would deaccession the inferior copy.

05:05.355 --> 05:08.118
But you'd certainly try to keep a copy of every book, right?

05:08.138 --> 05:10.221
I mean, of every title.

05:11.122 --> 05:12.243
That we've ever had?

05:13.625 --> 05:17.409
Sometimes superseded, well, even superseded reference collections.

05:17.429 --> 05:19.431
We're very fortunate in being a member.

05:19.451 --> 05:26.700
I don't know if you're familiar with something called the, let me get the initials right,

05:27.237 --> 05:30.023
the Center for Research Library, CRL.

05:30.864 --> 05:43.029
That's a cooperative group, a membership group that is a repository for lesser-used research materials.

05:44.232 --> 05:46.697
They collect things like...

05:47.217 --> 06:01.317
They do a lot of microfilm purchasing, but it's also a place where sometimes libraries do send materials that they withdraw from their collections but want to be sure that a copy is available on interlibrary loan.

06:01.357 --> 06:07.125
And so some libraries might send, for example, superseded reference materials.

06:07.626 --> 06:11.872
You know, when a new directory comes out, do you really need to keep the superseded one?

06:12.252 --> 06:14.596
Well, yes, there's a historical value to that.

06:15.978 --> 06:16.178
Yes.

06:17.002 --> 06:27.322
So some libraries would withdraw a copy of a reference book if they know there's a copy available in the Center for Research Libraries.

06:27.963 --> 06:35.117
Chicago considers itself a research library, really a comprehensive research library.

06:35.157 --> 06:38.824
So again, we would not do that because we see

06:38.990 --> 06:44.158
research value in older volumes of books in print, for example.

06:46.221 --> 07:07.613
So in terms of withdrawing copies, if something is completely beyond repair, if something is on brittle paper and has been, you know, there's no way it can be rebound, there's no way the artifact can be saved,

07:08.065 --> 07:21.158
and again, I'm speaking of general collections materials, not something in special collections, I think there is a possibility that a photocopy might be made for circulating use and the original might be withdrawn.

07:22.400 --> 07:37.195
I guess I'm trying to find some way to really, and I really haven't gotten it yet, but this whole matter of last copies, you know, where you do have libraries that...

07:37.175 --> 07:47.405
deaccession titles and maybe for the obvious reasons that nobody's reading them or nobody's read them.

07:48.346 --> 07:52.570
That wouldn't really be an obvious reason in a research library.

07:52.710 --> 08:04.701
If a program, an academic program, is no longer taught here,

08:05.390 --> 08:23.888
okay, say we built up a collection in an area that supported an academic program and that academic program is no longer taught, we might allocate less funding for new purchases in that area.

08:24.209 --> 08:26.233
We would...

08:27.850 --> 08:36.099
you know, look more to, say, interlibrary loan to, you know, support current use, but we wouldn't go and pull those books from the shelf.

08:36.380 --> 08:36.820
You wouldn't.

08:37.181 --> 08:37.421
No.

08:37.481 --> 08:39.443
But, I mean, there are institutions who would, though.

08:39.463 --> 08:40.044
That's right.

08:40.244 --> 08:52.658
And I think that in this, as in so many other things, Nick, technology has really made it possible for those libraries to verify that there are other copies.

08:52.678 --> 08:56.963
But to your knowledge, do they do that?

08:58.276 --> 09:03.222
I mean, are there last copies that you think that are deaccessioned?

09:03.262 --> 09:06.125
How would I go about finding something like that, would you think?

09:06.866 --> 09:10.210
Is that something that OCLC could help me with, do you think?

09:11.992 --> 09:16.257
That's such an individual library policy.

09:16.317 --> 09:20.942
I mean, it's certainly not something we would do here because...

09:21.833 --> 09:42.087
we would be on the very cautionary side of, I mean, we would really not be likely to be withdrawing things, you know, that, how would you, I mean, your question is really,

09:42.472 --> 09:48.838
whether libraries check to see or whether there is a risk that a last copy could be withdrawn.

09:48.858 --> 09:57.045
I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, if you have any knowledge on that.

09:57.265 --> 10:06.594
That's a toughie, because I would assume that most libraries in the process of deaccessioning check OCLC.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.259
That is certainly something we would do.

10:13.623 --> 10:18.070
Now, and I can't speak for whether every library could do that.

10:18.390 --> 10:30.889
So maybe a good way to get at that would be to try and talk to people at smaller libraries that might do more deaccession, more withdrawing.

10:31.390 --> 10:36.458
Would you think, which of the libraries today that are more likely to be doing this, do you think?

10:37.130 --> 10:49.529
Well, I think it would be a library that sees itself as serving more immediate readers' needs rather than defining itself as a research collection.

10:50.150 --> 10:55.759
So you might find that in a public library, and that's obviously one of the issues in San Francisco.

10:56.020 --> 10:56.580
Uh-huh.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.964
Major issue.

10:59.345 --> 11:03.772
And, you know, you might find it in smaller college libraries.

11:03.932 --> 11:04.032
Yeah.

11:05.125 --> 11:11.152
This is not something that's discussed at these various forums and seminars that you go to, though, I gather.

11:11.173 --> 11:15.057
Well, let me just sort of make one distinction for you that may be helpful.

11:15.137 --> 11:21.926
And, you know, I can't help you with this question, but the people who might be able to... That's what I'd love.

11:21.946 --> 11:22.206
Yeah.

11:22.326 --> 11:27.673
I mean, the reason I can't help you is that, and why I feel even uneasy talking...

11:28.480 --> 11:45.125
except in very general terms about University of Chicago library policy, if you think about it, when something is in a special collection, I mean, it really has sort of passed.

11:45.165 --> 11:52.817
By accepting something into special collections, we've really accepted a responsibility for it.

11:53.624 --> 12:00.311
you know, sort of physical preservation, physical safekeeping, long-term retention.

12:00.371 --> 12:18.650
And so any decision by me or any one of my colleagues to deaccessing from special collections really is guided by professional ethics and institutional policy.

12:19.091 --> 12:23.175
And I think it's very unlikely that there's a risk

12:23.678 --> 12:30.046
that something is going to be deaccessioned from a special collection that, you know, might be the last copy.

12:30.146 --> 12:33.950
We really worry about these decisions very, very much.

12:34.491 --> 12:43.822
And I don't think I'm really asking you to, I wouldn't expect to be quoting you on comments on what other institutions might be doing on this.

12:43.882 --> 12:51.711
Right, and so I guess all I'm saying is that in the special collections community, the risk of deaccessioning

12:52.585 --> 13:10.999
a last copy of something is not something that we would be likely to discuss because we agonize and do so much, I would think, all investigate so thoroughly things that we're even thinking about deaccessioning.

13:11.603 --> 13:24.521
So, again, to sort of think about places that don't define themselves as libraries of record or research collections might be where that is more likely to happen.

13:24.541 --> 13:30.209
But I have to tell you, did you see the Getty exhibition at the Morgan Library by chance?

13:30.450 --> 13:30.830
Yeah.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.152
It was really wonderful, wasn't it?

13:32.192 --> 13:32.452
Yeah.

13:32.913 --> 13:39.282
Well, there were three items there, and basically pride of place items.

13:39.262 --> 13:56.376
that one of Brian Meggs' associates said to me are among his favorite, and each one of these, to use his word, was a discard from an American research library, one from the Folger, one from the John Carter Brown Library.

13:56.812 --> 14:01.958
You know, I guess because it no longer fit into the collectory.

14:01.978 --> 14:04.782
It never really did fit into the collecting scheme at Brown.

14:05.022 --> 14:08.507
Well, and also the, yeah, I mean, I think we're talking about two different things.

14:08.527 --> 14:11.230
We are, but I mean it's... We're talking about discarding and deaccessioning.

14:11.270 --> 14:11.731
Exactly.

14:12.412 --> 14:15.656
And so, again, I think it's really important.

14:15.776 --> 14:21.503
I mean, I do think that libraries make...

14:21.685 --> 14:30.531
need to make decisions about what did or did not, does or does not fit within their collecting scope.

14:31.034 --> 14:35.020
You know, the smart ones do that very cautiously and conservatively.

14:35.060 --> 14:36.622
And they don't throw them away, actually.

14:36.682 --> 14:39.707
They get very good value for them.

14:39.867 --> 14:41.289
I was talking about last week.

14:41.309 --> 14:41.910
I understand.

14:42.611 --> 14:44.474
I was just thinking, absolutely.

14:44.494 --> 14:48.800
And I really wasn't blurring the distinction between the two.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.463
It just kind of came to mind there.

14:51.164 --> 14:55.911
So anyway, just to sort of go back to where we started a little bit, I think that

14:56.600 --> 15:20.667
The commitment and the responsibility and the challenge of preserving book culture in book form and taking advantage of the digital age to enable it to be used by a broader public and in different ways.

15:21.170 --> 15:29.442
is really something that we're all facing, but in no way is it going to diminish the importance of

15:30.012 --> 15:34.899
the extraordinary print inventories of our nation's lives.

15:34.919 --> 15:53.666
Now, without asking your comment on specifics, but if I were to tell you that a new university opened in Florida two years ago, and the incoming president said his hope and his goal was to have a library no larger than a telephone booth.

15:53.686 --> 15:53.826
Mm-hmm.

15:53.806 --> 15:55.869
How do you respond to something like that?

15:56.089 --> 16:03.179
I'd want to know what their curriculum is and what they expect to be supporting in terms of education.

16:03.219 --> 16:17.839
I mean, there is no doubt, Nick, that teaching and learning are being transformed in technology and that there are many things that can be taught and studied through distance learning or teaching.

16:18.224 --> 16:19.628
You know, direct learning.

16:20.029 --> 16:26.027
But this has a campus, by the way, with a goal of having, I think, 15 or 20,000 students with a library.

16:26.548 --> 16:30.078
And in fact, there's a very cute story, and I'm including this in the book.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.706
The woman who came in came from Brandeis.

16:33.698 --> 16:37.263
Carolyn Gray is her name, a very capable woman.

16:37.804 --> 16:43.892
And she said, well, that sounds fine, but we need books, is what she said.

16:43.912 --> 16:49.780
And it happened that a liberal arts college in New Jersey closed and went out of business.

16:50.001 --> 16:57.351
And they got the library, and they got it for a song, and a really good, nice academic library.

16:58.452 --> 17:02.558
And so they opened with 150,000 books.

17:03.263 --> 17:08.829
Then on the other hand, you go out to Cal State Monterey, and they put it all right there on the web.

17:08.869 --> 17:11.852
They were going to open without a library at all.

17:12.552 --> 17:17.558
And then there was, I don't know if you remember that story, they said there wasn't even a library planned.

17:17.598 --> 17:18.719
Right, right.

17:18.739 --> 17:22.943
Then there was an uproar, they put one in, but they've been open now for six years.

17:24.044 --> 17:30.531
And to date, they're quite proud of the fact that they only have 38,000 books after six years.

17:31.672 --> 17:31.752
Wow.

17:32.305 --> 17:45.478
Well, you know, like I said, there are, I'm sure, many approaches to learning that can be supported by the web and electronic sources.

17:46.479 --> 17:58.330
But I find it very difficult to believe that the full range of humanistic education can be successfully authored.

17:58.647 --> 18:03.156
without access to books.

18:03.176 --> 18:11.011
Well, I did an interview with Tony Grafton last summer, last July, and it's amazing.

18:11.051 --> 18:14.938
Of course, Princeton, I guess, I forget the number, but I've used it.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.521
It's been a while.

18:16.805 --> 18:26.339
The number, they actually are able to record the number of checkouts per student and per faculty member in a year, and it's just an unbelievable number.

18:29.244 --> 18:43.926
It's vast, but there is no doubt that what I worry about and I think all my colleagues worry about is that increasingly students do rely on

18:44.277 --> 18:46.299
on what is available online.

18:46.500 --> 19:02.039
And I think that educators have the responsibility to make sure they understand what a minute fraction of the world's knowledge is available online and in even their lifetimes ever will be.

19:03.020 --> 19:11.550
And so part of the learning process, I think everybody is aware now, is critical evaluation of what's online.

19:12.796 --> 19:33.560
But just like librarians used to teach how you evaluate and know a good reference book from a bad one or what are some of the critical thinking skills that you need to evaluate, something that you see in print, those same skills need to be translated to an Internet world in spades.

19:34.401 --> 19:41.689
But I think that institutions that don't make it physically clear

19:42.023 --> 19:51.174
that not everything that a student should be consulting is available online is really giving only half the story and not even half.

19:51.194 --> 20:02.026
But we have definitely seen the trend, certainly in journals and in monographs, that I think their time is basically limited, wouldn't you think?

20:02.046 --> 20:04.129
I think it will certainly come.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.171
I mean, it is coming soon as then.

20:06.211 --> 20:09.415
And I think that libraries and universities are...

20:10.289 --> 20:36.820
helping that along by trying to form very creative partnerships between academic publishers and universities and libraries as a way to sort of counteract the spiraling costs of journals and to really get some collaborations going that in effect

20:37.238 --> 20:44.054
put back into the academic arena the production of some scholarly journals.

20:45.317 --> 20:54.960
I had a very interesting interview with Dr. Billington at the Library of Congress, and he feels that, of course, he's committed to books, as well he should be, being the Librarian of Congress.

20:55.649 --> 21:06.484
But he also feels that one area where the electronic stuff will be most useful is in this, in the Ph.D.

21:06.524 --> 21:06.945
theses.

21:07.045 --> 21:13.975
And he said, the wonderful quote is, a lot of wonderful Ph.D.

21:14.055 --> 21:17.179
theses do not get published, and a lot of lousy ones do.

21:17.199 --> 21:21.285
And he thinks that, you know, this will have a very...

21:21.738 --> 21:37.799
positive effect of really allowing the printed book to flourish and to maybe do for the printed book what photography did for the artists, the painters, you know, maybe did release them.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.141
Well, it's interesting.

21:39.181 --> 21:50.175
I mean, we have a collection, you know, we have many, many 17th and 18th century dissertations, highly obscure at the University of Chicago because at that time,

21:50.678 --> 21:55.124
the publication of a dissertation was a requirement, you know, of getting a degree.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.526
The publication was?

21:56.566 --> 21:56.786
Yeah.

21:57.026 --> 21:57.287
Really?

21:57.487 --> 22:02.754
Yeah, I mean, most of them were published, you know, we would, today we would probably call them vanity publications.

22:03.035 --> 22:07.901
I have no idea how many copies were published, but they were printed, let's say printed.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.203
No kidding, really?

22:10.244 --> 22:10.505
Yeah, mm-hmm.

22:10.525 --> 22:12.627
And... When roughly was this?

22:12.647 --> 22:14.610
I mean, has this come up pretty recently, or...?

22:15.282 --> 22:18.706
I don't know when that was stopped.

22:18.786 --> 22:32.183
I mean, ours certainly go, I mean, we have comprehensive collections or very large collections through the 18th century, and it seems like by the early 19th, maybe, things were changing.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.064
I'm really not sure.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.647
It would be an interesting thing to know.

22:34.687 --> 22:39.012
But when you were talking about...

22:39.582 --> 23:03.970
the Florida library that bought the collection of a, you know, New Jersey institution that was going out of business, I was reminded of the founding collection of the University of Chicago library, which, you know, if you think about institutional libraries and why Chicago is different, say, from Princeton or, you know, Yale or, well, you know, we were founded in

23:04.237 --> 23:15.513
the early 1890s, so by the time Chicago was founded, the Eastern Ivy League schools were in business for 200 years and buying books as they came out.

23:16.074 --> 23:26.329
And here you have this institution in the Midwest, the sole purpose of which is to be a research university on the German model.

23:26.849 --> 23:35.121
And the founding president, you know, the university was supported by John D. Rockefeller and the founding president, William Rainey Harper, was

23:36.350 --> 23:41.516
Smart enough to know that you couldn't found a research university without a great library.

23:41.596 --> 23:46.603
So he went off to Germany and he bought the entire inventory of an antiquarian book.

23:47.003 --> 23:48.845
Oh, I've got to have this.

23:49.606 --> 23:50.788
Where can I get this?

23:50.868 --> 23:52.270
It's a great story.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.271
Is there something on it?

23:53.391 --> 23:56.435
Actually, you know, do you use the web a lot?

23:56.455 --> 23:57.135
Oh, I do, yeah.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.218
Okay, let me see if I can.

23:59.198 --> 24:04.506
There's nothing paradoxical about this, but yes, I do.

24:06.269 --> 24:06.729
Of course there isn't.

24:06.849 --> 24:13.980
I'm looking to see if I can get to the site quickly or if it's going to take a little longer for me to send you.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.650
That's a great story because really what I'm in this very chapter that I'm looking at right now, by the way, the college in New Jersey was up so low.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.814
or East Orange, New Jersey.

24:22.915 --> 24:27.924
In May of 1995, they went bankrupt, mainly because of where it was.

24:27.965 --> 24:31.391
I mean, just the demographics changed.

24:31.752 --> 24:32.634
And I'm looking at it right now.

24:32.654 --> 24:35.820
Faced with $12.5 million in debt and declining enrollment,

24:36.070 --> 24:42.784
The school declared bankruptcy and turned all its assets, including a $125,000 volume library over to for liquidation.

24:42.844 --> 24:47.273
So she came in and just got this wonderful library.

24:47.474 --> 24:52.324
Well, I mean, what's ironic about this is that from...

24:52.304 --> 24:54.448
from nothing or very little.

24:54.508 --> 25:05.749
I mean, there was an old University of Chicago that had a small library collection, and there was a Baptist theological seminary that we merged with because it was a Baptist institution.

25:05.829 --> 25:13.063
But by the time Chicago opened its doors, it was, I think, the fourth or fifth largest library in the country.

25:13.043 --> 25:13.564
Wow.

25:13.664 --> 25:17.430
Because of this one acquisition of the Berlin Collection.

25:17.450 --> 25:23.399
And there is an essay about it on our webpage that we'll find and send to you.

25:23.419 --> 25:32.453
What's so good about this is, I mean, when I was up in Toronto, Richard Landon told me about when York University was, and I'm looking at it right here,

25:32.838 --> 25:34.420
This is in the 1960s.

25:34.600 --> 25:40.409
The way they started building their libraries, they sent trucks out to antiquarian bookstores.

25:41.210 --> 25:49.621
Well, we just brought it all back in one fell swoop, and it really was quite a while.

25:49.782 --> 25:54.248
I'm looking at the place in this chapter.

25:54.488 --> 25:56.731
I just called it up exactly where it would go.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.335
Okay, well, I just found it on our website.

25:59.315 --> 25:59.936
Oh, great.

26:00.016 --> 26:00.216
Okay.

26:00.236 --> 26:03.541
And I will cut and paste the URL and send it to you in an email.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.104
That's probably the best way to do it.

26:05.124 --> 26:06.245
That's wonderful, wonderful.

26:06.265 --> 26:06.486
Okay.

26:07.127 --> 26:20.126
So anyway, Chicago has always been... And the reason I was thinking about this story when I was talking about the dissertations, Nick, is that I like to call it our oldest backlog.

26:21.528 --> 26:23.972
We still have...

26:24.323 --> 26:45.056
some things from this Berlin acquisition of 1891 that have not been cataloged, and a large number of them are dissertations from the 17th and 18th century because they are very, you know, they're mostly by obscure authors and they're, you know, very costly to catalog.

26:45.096 --> 26:48.542
And we just got a National Endowment for the Humanities grant

26:48.843 --> 26:52.409
this year that will help us do some of that.

26:52.509 --> 26:56.255
So you still intend to do it, even though it's over 100 years old at this point?

26:56.275 --> 26:56.495
Absolutely.

26:58.258 --> 27:00.582
So this is a backlog that goes back 100 years?

27:00.622 --> 27:01.283
That's right.

27:01.303 --> 27:03.066
That's wonderful.

27:03.086 --> 27:06.812
And do you think that it will have scholarly applications at some point?

27:06.832 --> 27:07.313
Absolutely.

27:07.333 --> 27:07.674
Yeah.

27:07.694 --> 27:12.201
I mean, there are treatises in, you know, there's a lot of science

27:13.447 --> 27:14.950
There's a lot of early science.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.833
There's a lot of history of religions.

27:16.933 --> 27:27.212
The NEH grant that we just got was for our history of religions collection and a lot of the dissertations that were in.

27:27.372 --> 27:28.975
And when I say, you know,

27:29.275 --> 27:31.899
that it's a backlog that goes back 100 years.

27:32.020 --> 27:41.715
I mean, most of the Berlin collection is long catalogued, but there are some few pockets, and some of them do have these more obscure descriptions.

27:41.736 --> 27:43.719
And you call it the Berlin collection, right?

27:43.739 --> 27:55.418
It's called the Berlin collection because the antiquarian bookseller was located in Unter den Linden, the great street in Berlin, in East Berlin, and the...

27:55.718 --> 28:02.345
bookseller, which was a vast bookseller, was called S. Calvary and Co.

28:02.425 --> 28:04.186
Oh, this is all there, right?

28:04.667 --> 28:08.331
I can't wait to go get it.

28:08.831 --> 28:14.257
I can just absolutely, totally guarantee you that it will take pride and place in this chapter.

28:14.577 --> 28:24.747
I mean, I think it's also for me and for us a way of saying that the University of Chicago was founded with the premise that

28:25.250 --> 28:32.599
a great library is part of what we need to offer the kind of education that this institution is committed to.

28:32.679 --> 28:44.352
So to go back to your question about what's my response to startup institutions that don't feel they need a library, well, they're obviously thinking that they're going to offer a different kind of education.

28:46.114 --> 28:46.735
Right.

28:47.255 --> 28:53.163
I don't want to underestimate the fact that higher education is changing.

28:53.183 --> 28:56.387
Distance learning is clearly the wave of the future.

28:56.827 --> 28:57.408
You think so?

28:57.749 --> 29:03.616
Yeah, for a lot of reasons, and just demographics, economics.

29:04.217 --> 29:06.560
Even at the research level that you're talking about?

29:06.580 --> 29:17.194
No, I mean, when I say the wave of the future, I think that there will be vast improvements in the way distance education is offered.

29:17.917 --> 29:28.071
but it's never going to compete with the kind of direct interpersonal interaction that a place like Chicago Pride is going on.

29:28.672 --> 29:37.304
And in environments like that, contact with original sources is always going to be original research.

29:37.664 --> 29:39.587
I mean, what do digital...

29:41.542 --> 29:47.935
Online collections like what the Library of Congress, I don't know if Billington talked about, the National Digital Library.

29:47.975 --> 29:48.596
They did, yeah.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.903
And the University of Chicago is very involved in that.

29:51.963 --> 29:55.129
We just got our second LC Ameritech Award.

29:55.885 --> 29:58.669
You know, I don't know if he talked about that.

29:58.769 --> 30:07.219
He didn't talk about that, but he did talk about the kinds of things that he wants digitized, basically the one-of-a-kind, non-book, unique kinds of things.

30:07.239 --> 30:07.880
That's fine.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.884
Photographs and monographs and whatever.

30:10.904 --> 30:13.487
And that's all fine, but it's a selection.

30:14.148 --> 30:14.268
Right.

30:14.288 --> 30:25.082
And for both research and for teaching, I believe that there is a great loss in something that has been...

30:25.619 --> 30:45.490
selected from a larger whole because the opportunity for discovery and the opportunity for making your own decision about what is trivial and what is significant has, in a sense, been winnowed down for you.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.555
Now, you're in special collections.

30:49.025 --> 30:55.933
Do you feel that it is essential for a serious scholar to, to use a phrase, to handle the goods?

30:56.334 --> 30:57.475
Do you have to, do you have to?

30:57.876 --> 31:00.159
It depends on what they're doing.

31:00.179 --> 31:10.972
You know, I mean, I guess, I guess one of the notable recent examples is this, the Ulysses manuscript, you know, which was a Gabler who worked from facsimiles and made mistakes.

31:11.332 --> 31:17.580
Yeah, I mean, for editorial purposes, I think absolutely, you know, you're not going to,

31:17.729 --> 31:25.204
base conclusions on a digital surrogate, which can be, you know, unreliable or misleading.

31:25.404 --> 31:36.707
On the other hand, there are many, you know, doing preliminary work with digital surrogates.

31:36.727 --> 31:39.332
You know, I think that's a great benefit.

31:39.937 --> 31:52.835
There's no reason not to take a vast collection of photographs and select from that what you want to view in the original form.

31:53.255 --> 31:58.182
And then Roger Stoddard tells me of a circumstance where...

31:58.668 --> 32:06.707
He purchased some Black Panther papers, and he said, you know, these were mimeographed things on the worst quality paper imaginable.

32:07.429 --> 32:10.576
And he said, maybe, you know, and it's in a safe right now.

32:10.617 --> 32:12.240
He doesn't know what he's going to do.

32:12.762 --> 32:17.132
If you came in and requested to read these things, he'd have to turn you down right now.

32:17.112 --> 32:19.975
He said he might have to broker with you.

32:20.936 --> 32:26.362
Maybe you can get some money to make a copy, and then we'll make the copies available to you.

32:26.843 --> 32:32.069
He said, but this more or less has what he perceives to be maybe one good pass through the copying machine.

32:33.050 --> 32:36.253
And, you know, so then we have that particular kind of problem, don't we?

32:36.734 --> 32:37.955
It's almost like a watercolor.

32:37.995 --> 32:45.043
Yeah, well, that's sort of what I said before, you know, that it's a preservation medium insofar as it lets more people

32:45.597 --> 32:55.708
view the surrogates without handling the originals when you would have to, you know, sort of close the door on the originals because they'd be used up.

32:56.249 --> 33:11.665
On the other hand, I mean, here's another, I think, example of where even when teachers embrace the digital sort of stuff, they want their students to handle the goods.

33:12.146 --> 33:14.068
Chicago runs something

33:14.572 --> 33:15.733
It's the Newberry Library.

33:15.793 --> 33:19.057
It's sort of based at the Newberry Library, but it's really run by the public schools.

33:19.137 --> 33:21.940
It's called the Metro History Fair.

33:22.140 --> 33:22.541
I like it.

33:23.242 --> 33:32.231
And every year, students, you know, there's a theme, and students are expected to do original research.

33:32.251 --> 33:33.793
We're talking what level students?

33:33.813 --> 33:34.294
High school students.

33:34.354 --> 33:34.854
Really?

33:34.874 --> 33:36.636
No kidding.

33:36.656 --> 33:38.318
And every year...

33:39.074 --> 33:55.374
we get students who want to study the origins of atomic energy or, you know, the first atomic, you know, the Manhattan Project, and they come to use the Enrico Fermi papers at the University of Chicago.

33:55.594 --> 33:56.255
That's amazing.

33:56.435 --> 34:01.121
Now, you know, every year I worry, are these papers going to be used up?

34:01.982 --> 34:05.706
And so we thought about, shouldn't that be...

34:06.344 --> 34:12.312
a digital, you know, our sort of first priority for digitizing parts of these papers.

34:12.973 --> 34:21.104
Well, the answer is the high school teachers require the students to use the originals.

34:21.124 --> 34:22.566
And have they articulated why?

34:22.926 --> 34:29.615
Well, because they want them to have the joy of firsthand content with these documents.

34:29.635 --> 34:33.921
And do you see it when a youngster... It's mixed.

34:34.087 --> 34:42.800
Some of them are obviously just fulfilling an assignment, and some of them are really very excited.

34:43.961 --> 34:59.824
And a lot of it is dependent on... I mean, it's very labor-intensive for us because in order for them to use these materials safely and appropriately, it's a very labor-intensive effort for us to...

35:00.243 --> 35:04.288
sort of have that transaction with each of us, each of the students.

35:04.508 --> 35:05.830
And this is run out of the Newbery?

35:06.711 --> 35:13.500
No, it's run by the Chicago Public Schools, but I think they, when I said it's run out of the Newbery, I mean, they have an office at the Newbery.

35:13.520 --> 35:13.820
I see.

35:14.421 --> 35:17.645
But it's really a Chicago Public School.

35:17.665 --> 35:18.486
That's fascinating.

35:18.506 --> 35:19.788
I wonder how they hit on that.

35:20.008 --> 35:26.757
I don't know either, but it really happens every year, and some of them, you know, they...

35:26.973 --> 35:42.990
We have the papers of Julius Rosenwald, who was a philanthropist who did a lot of wonderful, started a lot of schools in the South, and his papers are a favorite for students to use.

35:43.030 --> 35:56.524
There are certain key collections that they sort of come back for, and I have to think, like Roger, each year, do I need to close off certain portions of these collections because they're just going to be used up?

35:57.432 --> 36:04.233
But that's an example where digitizing them isn't going to help because the students need to see originals.

36:04.273 --> 36:05.637
They want the artifacts.

36:06.663 --> 36:13.830
It is interesting that you mentioned, I wonder why your founding, that was the founding president who went to?

36:13.910 --> 36:15.052
William Rainey Harper.

36:16.353 --> 36:17.314
Why did he pick Germany?

36:17.354 --> 36:19.236
Was it just an opportunity that he knew of?

36:19.296 --> 36:35.252
Well, I think he was traveling in Europe, and I think he was really looking for libraries, and whether he went there, he probably went there knowing that the firm was going to be going at it, was sort of on the block.

36:36.869 --> 36:39.294
And he had the money to do it, too, which is good.

36:39.354 --> 36:44.383
Well, it's the story in this article or the essay that I'll send you.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.666
I can't wait to see.

36:45.686 --> 36:52.419
Yeah, it's fabulous because basically he raised the money from Chicago philanthropists.

36:54.282 --> 36:55.324
That's fantastic.

36:55.344 --> 36:58.911
So it was really a civic...

36:59.363 --> 37:11.518
to bring these books to Chicago, also a wonderfully controversial one because Harper was known to be a very, he was very flamboyant and a superlative fundraiser.

37:11.538 --> 37:17.425
I mean, when Rockefeller gave money to found the university, it was sort of a matching grant.

37:17.465 --> 37:24.814
So Harper had to raise a lot of money for the founding of the university, and then he had to raise some more for this book acquisition.

37:25.250 --> 37:27.734
which actually included some medieval manuscripts.

37:27.815 --> 37:30.960
I mean, it's just unbelievable what came with it.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.964
So it was basically an unblocked purchase.

37:32.984 --> 37:37.252
He really didn't have an opportunity to go through and cull and pull out the good stuff.

37:37.272 --> 37:37.733
Oh, no.

37:37.753 --> 37:38.634
He bought it all.

37:38.794 --> 37:47.410
And as a matter of fact, there are huge discrepancies between how many tens or hundreds of thousands of items

37:47.879 --> 37:48.921
It included.

37:48.941 --> 37:53.349
And the count has never been reconciled.

37:53.429 --> 37:57.477
I mean, we still don't know exactly how much came with it.

37:57.577 --> 37:59.341
And this was when, approximately?

37:59.361 --> 37:59.601
1891.

37:59.781 --> 38:01.905
So it's over 100 years ago.

38:01.926 --> 38:04.470
And it is a collection that has held up well.

38:04.951 --> 38:08.899
It did make you a major research library.

38:09.119 --> 38:10.241
Oh, absolutely.

38:10.361 --> 38:11.203
And it's set...

38:11.825 --> 38:18.342
the course of this library, in other words, the strengths of this library in

38:18.558 --> 38:21.602
the sort of classical disciplines.

38:21.682 --> 38:32.016
I mean, not only the classics themselves, but philology, philosophy, the humanistic, you know, the Reformation, the Renaissance, archaeology.

38:32.897 --> 38:34.699
It's all in that collection.

38:34.719 --> 38:35.861
You know, that's a great story.

38:36.121 --> 38:38.384
I've not heard it before.

38:38.444 --> 38:41.168
I don't think it's really had much circulation, really.

38:41.428 --> 38:43.110
It really deserves it.

38:43.311 --> 38:45.053
Oh, you've got it.

38:45.073 --> 38:45.173
Yeah.

38:45.153 --> 38:48.278
It's a great... Consider it done.

38:48.298 --> 38:50.280
Yeah, terrific, because it's a good story.

38:50.341 --> 38:56.750
That's why I said when you said, can we talk about the future, I'm probably going to help you more on that.

38:56.770 --> 39:01.056
And that was just an entry into the conversation, you know, where it goes is where it goes.

39:02.258 --> 39:09.328
And then it is interesting also that Chicago, basically, the university developed this whole great books concept that you see at St.

39:09.348 --> 39:12.072
John's College down in...

39:12.052 --> 39:26.951
Yeah, although that was, I mean, certainly associated with Chicago through Mortimer Adler, whose papers we hold, and his association with Robert Maynard Hutchins.

39:28.854 --> 39:41.350
And it's still, I think, in some ways, it's a continuing tradition in the sense that Chicago's core curriculum...

39:42.595 --> 39:59.980
is not a great book's curriculum, but it is very much focused on critical reading and critical thinking and reading sort of primary texts.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.294
and forming one's own.

40:02.534 --> 40:06.378
I won't quote you on this, but are English majors required to read Shakespeare?

40:09.842 --> 40:11.243
And I won't quote you on this.

40:11.303 --> 40:13.726
I'm just curious.

40:14.406 --> 40:15.007
You'd hope so.

40:15.207 --> 40:20.232
I mean, there are no survey courses at Chicago.

40:20.653 --> 40:26.659
They are certainly required to take courses that...

40:27.888 --> 40:39.206
introduce them to canonical literature, whether Shakespeare is always a given or not, I couldn't say, because there's a certain amount of discretion in what each of those core courses are.

40:39.226 --> 40:51.286
You know, and I asked that question to Vartan when he was still at Brown, and he said, you know, you have to understand, he said, we, among our applicants every year, he said, we have 2,000 valedictorians and salutatorians.

40:51.306 --> 40:53.710
He said, the individual who's going to come here

40:53.690 --> 41:01.339
He said, if they're English majors and they don't take Shakespeare, the reason is probably they already know it upside down.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.162
I would sort of answer in a different way.

41:03.242 --> 41:21.604
Probably the line to get into Chicago Shakespeare courses is probably really, really wrong because David Bevington, who's a Shakespearean editor, is one of the most popular teachers at the University of Chicago, and he's just so magnetic that I think

41:22.006 --> 41:23.968
There's not a student who wouldn't want to take it.

41:23.988 --> 41:24.489
I can't imagine.

41:24.509 --> 41:26.391
How can you possibly be an English major?

41:27.693 --> 41:29.455
Did you say English major?

41:29.475 --> 41:30.276
English, yeah.

41:30.296 --> 41:31.056
Oh, forget it.

41:31.157 --> 41:32.778
No, that's no contest.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.000
That's not a problem.

41:34.020 --> 41:34.460
I'm sorry.

41:34.500 --> 41:38.005
For some reason, I thought, is every student required?

41:38.025 --> 41:38.365
Oh, no, no.

41:38.485 --> 41:40.027
I was talking about English majors.

41:40.047 --> 41:41.068
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

41:41.088 --> 41:46.174
You know, I mean, there are any number of institutions now where you can get a degree.

41:46.154 --> 41:49.980
in English literature without having been required to study to read Shakespeare.

41:50.461 --> 41:54.047
Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, you know.

41:54.067 --> 42:04.845
Well, I mean, again, you know, there are no survey courses here, but again, as a major, I think it'd be pretty unlikely that you wouldn't come in contact with them.

42:04.885 --> 42:12.938
And, I mean, Chaucer, there's a great Chaucerian tradition at Chicago because the...

42:13.289 --> 42:34.018
I don't know if you studied from John Manley and Edith Rickert, if you remember the version of the Canterbury Tales that really has been used throughout the 20th century was published by two Chicago English professors, John Manley and Edith Rickert.

42:36.061 --> 42:37.122
Must be the one I read.

42:37.543 --> 42:39.065
I would assume so.

42:39.225 --> 42:41.288
And so Chaucer has always been

42:41.707 --> 42:42.948
sort of a continuing interest.

42:42.988 --> 42:57.444
And another neat story about the library to show you sort of how Chicago was formed and also one of my favorite stories in terms of how things, you know, people say, well, scholarship is going off in new directions.

42:57.505 --> 43:01.028
Don't you have to buy all sorts of new things to support it?

43:01.249 --> 43:09.638
And I think that really misses the point that scholars look at sources from different ways

43:10.107 --> 43:15.853
and in different ways and with different eyes as they're investigating different topics.

43:15.873 --> 43:27.386
It's not so much that you have to buy new sources, you have to make sure that they're described in a way that they support all possible avenues of investigation.

43:28.447 --> 43:39.760
In the 30s, in the 20s or 30s, when this Chaucer edition was getting underway, there came on the market a collection

43:40.195 --> 43:44.803
of the sort of family, do you know what muniments are, the sort of family papers?

43:45.504 --> 43:51.755
Yeah, weren't there some, didn't Rosenbach pick up some muniments in England, I think?

43:51.936 --> 43:52.637
Yeah, exactly.

43:52.657 --> 43:52.937
Possibly.

43:52.997 --> 43:56.063
I mean, it's just a fancy word for family archives.

43:56.083 --> 43:56.964
Family archives.

43:58.026 --> 44:04.718
The muniments, the family papers of a family named Sir Nathaniel, Sir Nicholas Bacon,

44:05.187 --> 44:27.550
came on the market and basically the papers had been in the family since the 12th or 13th century and during the Depression they needed to put them on the market and so they were bought for Chicago because it was thought that they would be very useful in teaching students

44:28.019 --> 44:35.550
how to read Elizabethan handwriting and to help in the production of this Chaucer edition.

44:36.371 --> 44:51.293
And instead they became, I mean, they did that, but they also turned out to be this extraordinary resource for English social and legal and cultural history, tracing the development of English society from like 1250 years.

44:51.830 --> 44:56.598
through the 16th and 17th centuries.

44:56.718 --> 44:59.342
So things just get remined.

45:00.083 --> 45:08.837
Who would you suggest among your colleagues could give me some information about this convention of having to publish your dissertation?

45:10.400 --> 45:13.024
That's also pretty interesting.

45:13.044 --> 45:13.585
Yeah, it really is.

45:13.987 --> 45:16.410
I've not heard of that before.

45:16.650 --> 45:17.050
Right.

45:17.771 --> 45:19.433
But it actually had to be printed.

45:19.453 --> 45:20.354
It had to be published.

45:20.454 --> 45:30.044
It had to be... And they would accept a subsidy or vanity type... Well, the ones that I've looked at look like they must have been published in very small runs.

45:30.064 --> 45:30.184
Right.

45:30.204 --> 45:40.095
I mean, I want to say, you know, with a couple of hours, I don't think that's such a hard thing to get.

45:41.628 --> 46:06.454
information about yeah just where would i look do you think yeah i let me give it some thought okay if i can help you on that and i'd be you know i'll make the calls on that and that's uh be happy to follow up on but that is an interesting point that i think um it is a book culture kind of a thing isn't it without question very much i wonder if tony grafton um

46:07.733 --> 46:14.212
might have any insight because of his work on the footnote, it certainly... I think I'll send him an email and ask him.

46:14.372 --> 46:17.982
You know, he might, and, you know, he's a Chicago Ph.D.

46:18.022 --> 46:21.372
or Chicago...

46:21.790 --> 46:36.133
undergraduate, actually, so you might know that it came up in conversations that we were talking, and I'll sort of muck around also and see what I come up with, but he really might have, he just might know that off the top of his head.

46:36.574 --> 46:37.155
I'll bet he will, yeah.

46:37.175 --> 46:42.083
Listen, I've kept you for an hour, and I usually think an hour is about right for a good start.

46:42.544 --> 46:44.507
Let me go through and transcribe this

46:44.977 --> 46:53.289
And then I'll get back to you and go over a few things with you so, you know, you don't feel that you'll be embarrassed by anything that you said.

46:53.369 --> 46:55.091
I appreciate that opportunity.

46:55.191 --> 46:58.896
And meanwhile, I will send you the URL for the Berlin Collection.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.859
Oh, I can't wait to go look at it.

47:00.999 --> 47:01.981
Thanks so much, Allison.

47:02.001 --> 47:02.722
Okay, not at all, Nick.

47:02.742 --> 47:03.042
Bye-bye.

47:03.082 --> 47:03.443
Appreciate it.

47:03.483 --> 47:03.643
Bye-bye.
