WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:06.412
Test, test, test, test, test, test.

00:06.432 --> 00:13.600
There's one very nice book you may already familiar with that was written for the centenary of the British Library Association.

00:14.441 --> 00:17.585
Have you come across this book?

00:18.466 --> 00:22.590
What's it called now?

00:22.670 --> 00:24.332
As it was read or something like that.

00:26.054 --> 00:32.822
If you look at our Thunder Library Association in some catalogue, it was a very nice book that just, you know,

00:33.106 --> 00:37.811
ranged over lots of nice anecdotal things from British librarianship.

00:37.831 --> 00:39.813
They might have it for sale out here.

00:39.933 --> 00:42.556
No, it's a Library Association publication.

00:43.297 --> 00:48.202
I mean, Library Association is just around the corner from the British Museum.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.985
And it's a book I would recommend to you.

00:51.286 --> 00:52.787
Library Association.

00:53.228 --> 00:54.089
You said it was as?

00:54.810 --> 00:56.191
I don't remember which of that title.

00:56.251 --> 01:00.075
But it's a centenary publication that they published.

01:00.456 --> 01:01.577
I'll take a look for it.

01:01.861 --> 01:04.244
I think it was done for National Library.

01:04.945 --> 01:06.127
Excellent.

01:06.548 --> 01:10.513
The name might come back to me while we're, you know, while we're speaking.

01:10.533 --> 01:14.639
So what are you projecting your move over to St.

01:14.679 --> 01:14.880
Patrick's?

01:14.900 --> 01:17.163
Well, some of our, some of my colleagues there already.

01:17.303 --> 01:17.704
Really?

01:18.625 --> 01:27.177
So it's, can I do take milk and sugar?

01:30.903 --> 01:42.477
We've first British Library staff moved into the building at the end of November, 1996.

01:43.859 --> 01:48.144
And staff are steadily moving in now.

01:49.666 --> 01:53.911
I go in July this year together with various other colleagues.

01:54.612 --> 01:58.176
There was a big move in during September, October.

01:58.544 --> 02:03.411
24th November we open the first reading room for the public.

02:03.831 --> 02:09.960
And then we open reading room over a sequence of time going through to May 1999 after that.

02:09.980 --> 02:14.286
And when do you think all of these materials will be over?

02:15.188 --> 02:17.190
Again, that's being phased.

02:18.012 --> 02:21.617
It'll be not long after May 1999.

02:22.318 --> 02:25.362
The last reading rooms we're opening are the science reading rooms.

02:25.797 --> 02:33.289
And our science collections are mainly in a different building, which is over about one mile to the east from here.

02:34.451 --> 02:34.952
That's exciting.

02:35.673 --> 02:37.296
That's tremendously exciting, yeah.

02:37.496 --> 02:41.302
I mean, the building is going ahead really marvellously.

02:42.244 --> 02:49.996
And we're just very pleased at how progress has lasted here in the last few months.

02:50.016 --> 02:50.998
Hello, Mickey Most.

02:51.018 --> 02:51.619
It's great.

02:52.122 --> 02:54.165
We both have a book tie on this morning.

02:54.185 --> 02:58.471
Mine is slightly less respectful than yours.

02:58.491 --> 03:09.126
I'm curious, do you have something that you could express about how a national library serves as an expression of national culture, national heritage?

03:09.406 --> 03:17.117
I am sure many people have been able to express it far better than I could impromptu in response to your request.

03:17.789 --> 03:44.185
I share the views of many colleagues, including American colleagues, about national memories being national memories, the repository of the national thought of the language of our whole written history, being a source of information both about the past, for the past, about the future, for the future.

03:44.806 --> 03:49.612
But I mean, there's lots of people that have thought about this good and hard and written wonderful things.

03:50.253 --> 03:57.723
The mildest piece I sometimes quote when I'm giving talks from Barbara Tuchman, one of her books.

03:57.743 --> 04:03.571
She's got a beautiful piece at the beginning about the importance of libraries.

04:03.591 --> 04:08.738
She did most of her work, I think, in the New York Public Library, but she's one of those examples of

04:09.207 --> 04:19.379
I did interview with Martin and Gregorian about a week and a half ago, and he said, you know, the Polaroid camera was invented there, basically from research out of the New York Public Library.

04:20.020 --> 04:22.403
But Barbara Tuchman was one of those historians.

04:22.423 --> 04:23.404
I'll check that out.

04:23.424 --> 04:25.426
Oh, it's a wonderful quote.

04:25.446 --> 04:26.708
I can't remember where she got it from.

04:26.788 --> 04:33.416
I mean, she was quoting from somebody else, as I remember, but it's a very powerful quote.

04:33.436 --> 04:38.742
And again, this book I mentioned in the library has got lots of little quotes of that kind.

04:39.599 --> 04:43.444
One, we were up at Oxford yesterday.

04:43.584 --> 04:49.831
We spent a great pleasure morning with Dr. Simmons, John Simmons at all, for the college.

04:50.272 --> 04:58.161
He's done a marvelous work on Russian bibliography for many, many years, and it's actually kind of Dwyer in that field in the world.

04:58.461 --> 05:07.632
And we are interested in Eastern European national libraries and what has happened there, particularly in the post-Soviet period, starting

05:08.000 --> 05:14.007
with Sarajevo, you know, the horrific incident five years ago, four and a half years ago.

05:14.027 --> 05:19.835
I mean, you talk about how important is a national library to a nation or a repository.

05:19.855 --> 05:30.067
We had a party of Bosnian librarians here just a fortnight ago and talked with them about the horrific events that have happened to them.

05:30.087 --> 05:35.374
Fortunately, there's one or two Bosnian libraries, including the one in Tuzla, that has not been damaged too much.

05:35.759 --> 05:38.362
So that is the main repository now.

05:39.043 --> 05:47.913
But our Yugoslav specialist that we have here is in very close contact with Bosnian.

05:47.933 --> 05:51.777
And he's arranging various exhibitions of literature to go out to Bosnia.

05:52.618 --> 06:05.513
He's looking at ways of providing copies of information that we have and have collected over the last two or three years to go back to Bosnia in order to meet the needs that they have

06:05.797 --> 06:09.141
material that was lost in those appalling days of fighting.

06:09.401 --> 06:11.484
And this is the Sarajevo Library or the other one?

06:11.604 --> 06:12.885
The Sarajevo Library.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.768
Yes, that's right.

06:16.149 --> 06:25.681
Professor, Dr. Andres Riddlemeyer at Harvard is kind of spearheading this international effort to try and help in any way that they can.

06:25.701 --> 06:32.088
I remember he the person that wrote a fantastic piece about the Sarajevo Library for an initial conference.

06:32.108 --> 06:33.390
I believe so.

06:33.691 --> 06:42.062
incredibly moving piece that I remember at the time, you know, being overwhelmed by because it was such a powerful piece.

06:42.082 --> 06:47.189
But when you think about it, that is so profound and powerful.

06:48.671 --> 07:01.808
A statement that when you, if we have these other great libraries, for instance, you have Ukrainian libraries in New York, you have the Library of Paris when there was no Poland, and that was the National Library of

07:02.378 --> 07:07.084
To retain a sense of yourself and your culture and your history, you do need the books, though.

07:07.124 --> 07:09.226
You have to have a repository.

07:09.246 --> 07:29.010
Well, Panizzi, who is up there, who was the great librarian of Europe in the 19th century, he aspired that the British Museum Library, which it then was, should be the greatest French national library outside France, the greatest Italian national library outside Italy and France.

07:29.513 --> 07:46.823
And for many of those countries, we do have almost the best collections in the world for those countries, particularly countries like Italy, where they had huge problems right up until post-war time for it to get libraries sorted out, and even now have big problems.

07:47.845 --> 07:54.897
Many Italian scholars will come to the British libraries to do their research on Italian history, Italian culture.

07:55.231 --> 08:01.258
because we've actually collected material systematically during the 19th century, which none of their lives were able to do.

08:01.278 --> 08:03.000
This is precisely the kind of thing.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.381
This is exciting for me.

08:04.481 --> 08:15.434
So Eastern Europe, again, we've identified during the last few years the huge importance of continuing to develop Eastern European dimensions.

08:15.534 --> 08:18.437
Just because there's been such turmoil in Eastern Europe,

08:19.075 --> 08:33.777
Lots of collections have been thrown away, have been vandalized, been privatized, sold, given away, and the repository of much of that material is here in the British Library.

08:34.458 --> 08:36.320
Is this the policy of the library?

08:36.340 --> 08:37.182
It is, yes.

08:37.222 --> 08:38.644
What is the impulse for it?

08:39.285 --> 08:40.887
How would you articulate it?

08:40.907 --> 08:48.238
It's a matter of priority, really, to ensure when we're choosing where to give our priority for our collection.

08:48.843 --> 08:51.387
We obviously can't collect everything from everywhere.

08:52.068 --> 08:54.072
I mean, it's just not affordable in this day and age.

08:54.672 --> 09:05.109
And nor is it necessary, because there are many great libraries in other countries who are able to invest in very substantial collections.

09:06.171 --> 09:15.306
So Bibliothèque Nationale de France has got a magnificent, not just a building, magnificent collection, tremendous collecting policy, very fast out of digitization policy.

09:15.775 --> 09:17.597
I don't know if you're going there on this trip.

09:17.617 --> 09:18.739
Yes, on this trip we are.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.564
But I mean, that's a tremendous example of what can be done.

09:22.584 --> 09:37.264
A tremendous example of a French government investment, or precisely a French presidential investment, which is another marvellous statement of the importance of livelihood.

09:37.344 --> 09:44.854
There's a nice book I've got on the shelf here, which...

09:45.037 --> 10:01.146
I don't know if you read French, but you might find it interesting to get hold of, which is looking at many of the national libraries all around the world.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.111
But they call it the New Alexandrian Library.

10:04.131 --> 10:09.340
Yeah, this is kind of a theme.

10:09.674 --> 10:17.404
I'm told, I haven't checked it out yet, that they're planning to build a new Alexandrian library approximately on the presumed site.

10:17.724 --> 10:22.170
Yeah, it's already, the foundations are there, you know, it's going up, it's all being planned.

10:22.190 --> 10:27.157
I'm hoping that will be the epilogue of this new book that I'm writing, when you talk about a continuum.

10:27.757 --> 10:28.058
Yeah.

10:28.078 --> 10:31.642
And it will be a very modern library, as I understand it.

10:31.662 --> 10:32.063
Indeed, yeah.

10:32.083 --> 10:32.784
So we'll pick this up.

10:32.804 --> 10:35.327
There's a chapter on Alexandria in there as well.

10:35.881 --> 10:39.865
You may not get that easily in Britain, but you can order it through any French.

10:39.925 --> 10:42.827
I'm just going to... Do you want me to photograph it with a title page?

10:42.847 --> 10:43.948
That would be great.

10:44.949 --> 10:45.570
Thank you, sir.

10:48.913 --> 10:53.657
Quite a fine biography of Sir Anthony that was published about 20 years or so.

10:53.697 --> 10:56.620
If I have it at home, I just have it.

10:57.041 --> 11:02.045
Prince of Librarians, I think is the title of it.

11:02.646 --> 11:05.128
So that would be... Does it articulate that?

11:05.497 --> 11:09.243
Oh yes, it has plenty of that in there.

11:09.343 --> 11:09.564
Good.

11:09.924 --> 11:27.252
This is really what I'm trying, you know, part of what I'm trying to do is precisely the things that you... I mean, you could probably do this more easily than we can because we're right in the middle of all this and we don't have much time to get, you know, stand outside and think about what are we doing, what are we here for, where are we going to.

11:27.485 --> 11:38.234
And you and others like yourself can actually do more of that, looking from outside and thinking about the future.

11:38.254 --> 11:44.960
One thing Dr. Simmons said yesterday, that you add approximately a mile and a half of books per year.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.562
More, two and a half, three miles.

11:48.743 --> 11:49.764
And where do you put them?

11:49.804 --> 11:52.186
Do you have depositors like Harvard does?

11:52.947 --> 11:56.530
We've got a whole variety of different arrangements.

11:57.100 --> 12:05.789
We've got, in London, 17 buildings at the moment, of which I should think at least 10 hold some of the collections.

12:06.470 --> 12:13.176
And we've got a very large site in Yorkshire, 200 miles north of London, which holds a whole lot more.

12:14.217 --> 12:15.058
But with St.

12:15.118 --> 12:18.242
Pancras, books, we've already got a million books in St.

12:18.282 --> 12:18.722
Pancras.

12:19.603 --> 12:21.385
They're going at a rate of 10,000 a day.

12:22.686 --> 12:26.550
And we've found that, no.

12:26.902 --> 12:27.843
At the moment, there's not.

12:27.863 --> 12:34.249
If there's a van here, this van is carrying books from the Bruce Museum building.

12:34.809 --> 12:37.512
It's a van right over here.

12:37.612 --> 12:40.975
This van right over here.

12:40.995 --> 12:41.976
Right over here.

12:42.056 --> 12:42.857
Ten summers in a day.

12:43.157 --> 12:45.439
Coming from all over London, right?

12:45.459 --> 12:49.523
Mainly coming from the Bruce Museum building to start with.

12:49.803 --> 12:54.748
And once we've got that moving completed,

12:55.015 --> 12:58.439
which, as I said, is going to go right through into the middle of Monday night.

12:59.641 --> 13:09.193
We shall be down to four buildings in London that hold collections.

13:09.593 --> 13:09.753
St.

13:09.793 --> 13:10.775
Pankhurst will be one.

13:12.977 --> 13:19.666
We've got two big stores that we'll be carrying on using for another few years.

13:20.687 --> 13:23.250
One in

13:23.433 --> 13:26.056
in the city and one in southeast London.

13:27.017 --> 13:35.566
And then we have the newspaper library at Collindaire, which is about seven or eight miles north of St.

13:35.586 --> 13:39.410
Pancras, and where we never envisaged being able to get all our newspapers into St.

13:39.450 --> 13:40.752
Pancras.

13:40.772 --> 13:44.856
And then we've got the big site at Boston Star in Yorkshire.

13:44.876 --> 13:48.660
Is there any thought to digitizing the newspapers?

13:49.001 --> 13:51.263
Yes, we've done some digitizing already.

13:51.682 --> 13:54.065
We've done a lot more microfilming.

13:54.085 --> 13:55.707
We've been doing that for many, many years.

13:55.767 --> 14:03.036
Digitizing newspapers is much more expensive than microfilming newspapers.

14:03.517 --> 14:11.026
And there's still slightly less certain long-term security and conservation prospects.

14:12.247 --> 14:20.878
Also, more and more newspapers, modern ones, are, of course, available in digital form as CD-ROMs.

14:21.432 --> 14:26.557
So we're not rushing ahead with a nuclear digitization program.

14:26.577 --> 14:36.546
We're concentrating on making sure we've got particularly the older and brittle and deteriorating newspapers filmed for posterity.

14:37.387 --> 14:48.597
This might be an appropriate point to move into the whole question of the future of books as we know them, and libraries as we know them.

14:48.617 --> 14:50.899
I don't know if it's happening here in the UK,

14:51.638 --> 14:56.926
In the United States, we have universities that are no longer opening up libraries.

14:56.946 --> 14:58.648
They don't call them libraries.

14:58.668 --> 15:03.095
They call them student research centers, information.

15:03.115 --> 15:05.298
I don't even know what that means.

15:05.398 --> 15:11.287
It's kind of depressing when you think that a library, which means so much more than just a place to park the books.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.174
And I think it does involve a philosophical attitude.

15:16.194 --> 15:20.160
I think that change is taking place here, though in general I'd say it's

15:20.478 --> 15:28.908
not such a change as the addition of an extra form of library alongside the existing kind of library.

15:28.928 --> 15:35.656
So there is still a need for places where people can sit and work and read.

15:35.676 --> 15:41.904
And libraries in our universities are mainly there for people to go and sit in and work and read.

15:42.424 --> 15:45.308
And traditionally the reading matter has been on paper.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.932
With the electronic changes,

15:49.503 --> 15:54.988
That's being supplemented by large amounts of directly accessible electronic information.

15:55.008 --> 16:00.773
But often it's just little bits of information rather than whole text.

16:00.853 --> 16:07.660
Because whole text are not particularly pleasant to read for long periods on screen.

16:07.680 --> 16:13.124
There are still a lot of copyright issues with reading whole text.

16:13.945 --> 16:18.109
And I think it will be quite a long time before we see

16:19.135 --> 16:24.002
a major shift from conventional libraries to a completely new kind of library.

16:24.022 --> 16:28.068
What we'll see is a new kind of library coming and being alongside conventional libraries.

16:29.009 --> 16:37.682
So that conventional libraries will increasingly have masses of workstations in, and the workplaces are going to spread all around university campuses.

16:37.702 --> 16:42.488
In many universities in America that's already happening, beginning to happen in Britain as well.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.733
And that will provide

16:46.220 --> 16:52.547
you know, a much richer source of information for people, but books aren't going to die.

16:52.788 --> 16:56.512
In fact, journals have been published in greater and greater numbers.

16:56.592 --> 16:58.714
Books have been published in greater and greater numbers.

16:59.455 --> 17:01.498
More and more paper is being produced.

17:01.678 --> 17:08.025
We bite all the prophecies from 10, 15 years ago of paping society.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.707
Oh, it's just been the opposite of that.

17:10.727 --> 17:14.692
Yeah, I think even the electronic information has often been printed out by people.

17:15.333 --> 17:24.485
It's more convenient to carry it around somewhere or read it on the beach or in the garden, whereas a laptop's not so convenient in those places.

17:24.505 --> 17:34.999
How about your own attitude about replacing books with scanned books, with zeros and ones?

17:35.019 --> 17:37.422
I see a great place for both.

17:38.009 --> 17:42.995
I simply, we did a calculation of what it would cost to digitize Hobart.

17:43.015 --> 17:44.217
Oh, I'd love to know what that is.

17:44.237 --> 17:51.546
I don't remember the precise thing, but it was somewhere in the range of five billion pounds, something like that.

17:52.287 --> 18:00.638
You know, it was an amount which, you know, was not really a feasible amount to think about.

18:01.859 --> 18:02.080
Our St.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.663
Pancras building is costing 500 million pounds.

18:05.124 --> 18:06.846
So it was something like 10 St.

18:06.906 --> 18:07.847
Pancras buildings.

18:08.131 --> 18:08.471
Wow.

18:08.952 --> 18:10.074
That we were talking about.

18:11.175 --> 18:14.500
And that kind of money is not going to be available readily.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.644
Even though the costs are going down?

18:17.764 --> 18:21.869
It's coming down, but there's a lot of basic labor costs in doing it.

18:22.510 --> 18:35.067
We haven't yet gotten shoes, but we'll take a book and calmly go through turning the pages, doing the indexing, looking to see if the item is fragile.

18:35.536 --> 18:40.423
getting it off the shelf, putting it back onto the shelf, etc.

18:40.443 --> 18:42.666
You need to have people there.

18:43.307 --> 18:51.519
Our experience of digitizing newspapers, we digitized a lot of our 18th century newspapers, while it was very labor intensive.

18:51.539 --> 18:55.605
And there was a lot of dollars per page to copy some of that old material.

18:56.126 --> 19:03.737
Do you have a policy on books that nobody has used for a certain amount of time?

19:04.358 --> 19:07.141
You don't deaccession things, do you?

19:07.881 --> 19:08.562
Not really.

19:08.962 --> 19:15.108
I mean, we do it to a very limited extent, but mainly from our lending collections rather than our reference collections.

19:15.128 --> 19:26.339
The British Library has, in Yorkshire, a very big document supply operation, which mainly lends items and provides photocopies services.

19:26.359 --> 19:32.205
Some of that material is material that's duplicated, duplicate copies of the reference copies we have.

19:32.962 --> 19:37.568
So those we do de-accession after a while because we've got reference copies left over.

19:38.550 --> 19:50.686
For the material in the reference collection, the only de-accessioning we would do is more selectivity at the legal deposit point of entry.

19:51.367 --> 19:58.878
Where we get reprints of books where we just don't think it's worth getting the next copy, then we won't take it in.

19:59.619 --> 20:01.281
And sometimes where we've got reprints

20:01.565 --> 20:06.652
if we're going through the collections, we're finding reprints from the past, then we do our car.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.394
It's a waste of time to have that.

20:08.414 --> 20:10.316
But you are maintaining an archival copy.

20:10.336 --> 20:11.558
We are maintaining an archival copy.

20:12.059 --> 20:29.381
Some of the older newspapers we are deaccessioning, particularly where there are good surrogate copies of them on microfilm or digitized versions, and particularly foreign ones.

20:29.401 --> 20:30.643
So there's no point in our keeping

20:31.147 --> 20:41.502
great runs of German or US newspapers if we've got microfilm versions of them and the items are readily available in those countries.

20:42.343 --> 20:57.745
And even Scottish newspapers, we don't necessarily try to keep all paper copies of Scottish newspapers because the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, has got an excellent comprehensive collection of Scottish papers.

20:58.147 --> 21:08.841
It's fitting to have two national libraries not far from each other, both spending a lot of money on preserving items.

21:08.861 --> 21:09.421
The same thing.

21:09.441 --> 21:10.202
The same item.

21:11.244 --> 21:16.771
And I think that's a very important point we have to emphasize, is that you are the national library.

21:16.871 --> 21:21.437
You are also the deposit, the official deposit.

21:21.797 --> 21:22.078
Yes.

21:22.098 --> 21:26.263
In fact, there are six legal deposit libraries in the British Isles, or British publications.

21:27.053 --> 21:39.627
National Libraries of Wales, Scotland, and Britain, British Library, University Libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, and University Library of Dublin, Trinity College, Dublin, which is the sixth library.

21:39.647 --> 21:44.633
So all those six libraries automatically can get copies of all British publications.

21:44.653 --> 21:49.398
Well, that's probably a little excessive, wouldn't you think, if you're all getting copies of the same thing?

21:50.460 --> 21:53.843
We don't necessarily take copies of everything.

21:54.124 --> 21:54.985
You probably do.

21:55.085 --> 21:57.027
We take copies of virtually everything.

21:57.563 --> 22:13.458
the other libraries are more selective and wouldn't, for example, try and collect all British local newspapers because the cost of storing all British local newspapers is astronomical.

22:14.259 --> 22:25.630
And so we do have collaborative arrangements among these legal deposit libraries where we ensure that we are not taking more copies than we need of material.

22:26.167 --> 22:30.873
Have you ever heard of a phrase called phase deterioration?

22:31.073 --> 22:32.235
Is that a brand new phrase?

22:32.255 --> 22:33.637
Oh, it's new to me.

22:33.737 --> 22:34.958
It's new to me, too.

22:34.998 --> 22:37.542
They have heard of it at the Library of Congress.

22:37.562 --> 22:45.192
Apparently it originated at Cornell, where I've been, which is the cutting edge of all the future stuff.

22:46.173 --> 22:53.102
And apparently that's a phrase they use for books that may be getting fragile, that are fragile.

22:53.403 --> 22:59.169
Somebody has made a decision that the content may not be particularly important.

22:59.670 --> 23:03.714
So they made a determination that will keep it comfortable, give it a place to rest.

23:04.315 --> 23:09.060
But we won't initiate any invasive procedures, so to speak.

23:09.080 --> 23:13.385
It reminds me of a difficult decision being made in the British National Health Service.

23:13.405 --> 23:15.587
The language is almost the same.

23:15.948 --> 23:20.052
Obviously, we have to make priorities, too, in dealing with material.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.515
We've estimated

23:22.850 --> 23:33.902
that the amount of money that we would need to do a proper job in preserving our collections is somewhere near 100 million pounds.

23:34.282 --> 23:40.349
I think it was 250 million pounds is what we thought we would need.

23:41.750 --> 23:49.118
And we've done that on the basis of actually surveying the collections and calculating the cost of doing and looking at the material that we can't deal with.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.502
We actually spend somewhere around

23:53.005 --> 23:56.510
five or six million pounds a year on conservation.

23:57.351 --> 24:03.159
And so we've got about 50 years worth of conservation that we cannot afford to do.

24:04.301 --> 24:11.851
Quite large proportions of that are for material that if we can't do it for 50 years, it will not be doable.

24:12.232 --> 24:14.154
The material will have disintegrated.

24:14.194 --> 24:16.237
That's precisely what that phrase applies to.

24:16.257 --> 24:20.363
And so we're well aware of the concept even if we don't use the language.

24:20.680 --> 24:28.689
And all the time we're having to make very difficult decisions about how do we prioritize our spending on the material that's concerned.

24:29.330 --> 24:41.904
Again, fortunately we have, first with St Pancras, a building which is going to allow us to have far better atmospheric conditions than we've ever had before for collections.

24:42.545 --> 24:45.608
So the rate of deterioration will slow down greatly.

24:46.212 --> 24:56.043
In this building, we have the most awful problems of extremes of heat and cold, dampness, leaks, pollution.

24:56.243 --> 24:59.206
I mean, you know... How old is building recycling?

24:59.446 --> 25:01.549
Most of it's about 140 years old.

25:02.189 --> 25:03.911
Some of it goes back 240 years.

25:05.393 --> 25:08.757
Not designed for keeping books in conditions.

25:08.777 --> 25:12.861
Parts of the building that I walk around quite often, where the heat

25:13.499 --> 25:14.240
is horrific.

25:14.460 --> 25:17.784
It's the kind of heat that you wouldn't dream of keeping books in your own home in.

25:18.464 --> 25:23.450
And yet, there is great national connections being kept in these conditions.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.391
Quite awful.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.815
So that's a factor that will help us a great deal in St.

25:27.835 --> 25:27.995
Pancras.

25:28.535 --> 25:32.139
But still, material is already in such a power state that even the St.

25:32.179 --> 25:34.862
Pancras conditions will not help.

25:35.603 --> 25:38.867
And then we have to think about cooperation with other libraries.

25:39.027 --> 25:42.831
We have very good international and European corporations

25:43.418 --> 25:59.020
on preservation so that we have registers that show what books are being preserved in different countries and we're not duplicating the work on filming or digitizing earlier materials in different countries.

25:59.901 --> 26:11.978
And then we've got the programs of microfilming and a digitizer which we try to prioritize so that those things that otherwise disintegrate we catch before they do disintegrate.

26:11.998 --> 26:13.240
Are you prioritizing

26:14.266 --> 26:19.733
in terms of condition or by content?

26:19.953 --> 26:22.637
It's a mixture, obviously.

26:23.117 --> 26:39.479
There are some items where clearly the content is extremely important, particularly some of the older items, items that are believed to be unique.

26:40.159 --> 26:42.923
Obviously, we've got to deal with them.

26:43.392 --> 26:51.680
And we may give them priority over items whose condition is worse, but where we suspect there will probably be other copies available.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.863
It's a very difficult decision to make sometimes.

26:55.024 --> 27:05.914
And our newspaper library is one of the most difficult areas, because you can imagine that newsprint in the past has often been very poor quality, simply doesn't last very long.

27:06.715 --> 27:11.560
And already we've got thousands of volumes of newspapers

27:12.282 --> 27:18.030
where we can't really let people look at them, because you just have to kind of open the thing up.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.893
And you know what it's like with old newspapers.

27:19.913 --> 27:23.238
Bits of paper kind of crumble in your hands.

27:23.278 --> 27:37.659
Well, a few weeks ago, Gene Ashton from Columbia, I think, is telling me that kind of an ironic comment to this, but for a period of years, the New York Times actually did an archival copy of the Daily Paper on rag paper.

27:37.679 --> 27:40.483
And so this would be like an archival preservation copy.

27:40.801 --> 27:43.724
But nobody ever uses it because it's so difficult to handle.

27:44.184 --> 27:52.232
So what they find that they're using is either going back to the fragile one, right in the microfilm, and the New York Times stop doing it.

27:52.252 --> 27:56.035
So it's kind of an interesting paradoxical situation.

27:56.135 --> 28:02.121
Did they ever do any archival copies of the major... Not that I'm aware of.

28:02.161 --> 28:06.665
Again, with having the CD-ROM versions now, that's making a big difference.

28:07.466 --> 28:09.508
Also, of course, it affects the whole

28:09.792 --> 28:11.514
the comfort of what a newspaper is.

28:11.534 --> 28:13.216
You know, you're searching it in a different way.

28:14.677 --> 28:17.520
The storage becomes much simpler.

28:18.361 --> 28:27.091
But you also lose some things in that newspapers come out of different editions each day, and CD-ROM is going to have to choose one particular edition.

28:27.731 --> 28:33.818
We try and keep, not for all papers, but for many of the major pages, several editions all the time.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.664
So there's lots of quite difficult issues that come up in that area.

28:40.724 --> 28:53.456
If I were to give you an example, let's say an institution, an American institution, has started a procedure where they're selecting older books from their collections.

28:53.476 --> 28:58.881
It's no longer a copyright problem, so they can scan them.

28:58.901 --> 29:03.225
And they're scanning these books, making it a digital copy.

29:03.245 --> 29:05.447
And then they're disposing of the original book.

29:06.589 --> 29:10.292
So all that's remaining is these zeros and ones.

29:10.424 --> 29:13.869
There's been a lot of trouble, hasn't there, in the California department.

29:14.009 --> 29:15.431
One library in particular is doing that.

29:15.451 --> 29:15.731
One library.

29:15.751 --> 29:20.077
In this case, I'm telling you whether you're in the public side.

29:20.337 --> 29:23.461
I mean, we would not do that.

29:24.763 --> 29:39.402
I mean, also there are some areas where, particularly for the foreign newspapers, where we have already in the past, for many years, disposed of material that we have filmed.

29:40.343 --> 29:54.367
And by disposal, I mean offering it to other libraries, particularly to other national libraries, then offering it to other organisations, and as a last resort, actually pulping it.

29:54.687 --> 29:56.210
There's no demand for it.

29:57.011 --> 30:00.357
But that's the only category where we've done anything like that.

30:00.417 --> 30:01.138
I'm talking about books.

30:01.378 --> 30:02.080
Yeah, we're books.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.123
We go against the grain.

30:04.525 --> 30:07.649
And I wonder why would you go against it?

30:07.669 --> 30:08.971
Why would you not do it?

30:08.991 --> 30:13.057
Even if the book was in dreadful condition, it's badly foxed.

30:13.097 --> 30:18.044
We're talking about books when the acidic content of the paper is not good.

30:18.364 --> 30:21.248
It costs a lot of money to restore it.

30:23.852 --> 30:25.034
Maybe it should be called.

30:25.054 --> 30:25.755
I don't know.

30:25.775 --> 30:26.395
Maybe we will.

30:26.516 --> 30:29.019
Maybe we will one day do that.

30:30.081 --> 30:34.026
Obviously, we, at the moment,

30:34.748 --> 30:44.462
I think going back to your medical analogy, we try and give them a very good, comfortable home to live out their last days and extend those lives as long as possible.

30:45.444 --> 30:55.318
And eventually the point may well come, where for some of these older books, we have to make that political decision that it's not worth keeping anymore.

30:55.759 --> 30:57.261
We've got an effective surrogate.

30:58.663 --> 30:59.965
We will dispose of it.

31:00.666 --> 31:03.270
For British material,

31:04.077 --> 31:10.506
So far, we felt it would just be wrong to do that.

31:11.087 --> 31:22.202
We're not actually prevented by law from doing it if we decide ultimately that the book is no longer of any value to the collection.

31:22.903 --> 31:33.477
But perhaps there's some time longer until we're that much more certain about surrogates, about the durability of the surrogates,

31:34.233 --> 31:39.599
we prefer to keep those paper pockets.

31:39.920 --> 31:43.144
I'm not taking a formal position, by the way.

31:43.184 --> 31:48.150
I'm certainly not really as hysterical as Nicholson Baker in it.

31:48.170 --> 31:55.038
I think it was very therapeutic that he did what he did and wrote what he did, but, you know, who knows?

31:55.138 --> 31:57.081
I mean, people have very big problems.

31:57.822 --> 32:02.367
If I was given the choice of...

32:03.511 --> 32:22.977
a magnificent collection, which I had no room to store, I had to make room for it, and the only option was to destroy some material, which was of little value, and where we had, I was pretty confident in the surrogate, then in those situations I might say, right, that's what we're going to have to do.

32:24.339 --> 32:32.370
We've not been put into that difficult position yet, but I can imagine other libraries that could find themselves in very difficult conditions from the point of view of priorities.

32:32.823 --> 32:36.046
Well, I have an institution, Cornell.

32:36.987 --> 32:42.353
And their number two librarian told me that they are under a mandate from their trustees.

32:42.393 --> 32:46.017
Now, this is a university library, so it is slightly different priority.

32:47.158 --> 32:50.441
They do support the curriculum, I guess, et cetera.

32:50.942 --> 32:53.865
But they have 6.8 million volumes now.

32:54.486 --> 32:59.691
And apparently, they have a mandate to have that down to 6 million by the year 2000.

33:00.548 --> 33:07.057
So I guess that says to me we have to get rid of 800,000 books and also factor in what you're going to require.

33:07.077 --> 33:12.185
I guess what you're saying is we've picked a number, 6 million, and that's what it's going to be.

33:13.166 --> 33:22.019
We had a program about 15 years ago in Britain called Self-Renewing Library that applied to university libraries.

33:22.039 --> 33:27.387
And the idea was that universities would take a ceiling on the extended air collection.

33:27.407 --> 33:30.471
And for each new book they got in, one book would be removed.

33:31.328 --> 33:37.896
And that was applied in some universities.

33:38.497 --> 33:43.583
In general, it was felt not to be an achievable objective.

33:43.603 --> 33:56.138
It's actually becoming a little bit easier now because of the electronic information becoming available and because there is more cooperation now among universities and just the budgetary reasons.

33:56.158 --> 33:59.682
Universities cannot afford to buy as much as they used to be able to buy.

34:00.826 --> 34:04.150
That might be something that could be applied in the university library.

34:04.170 --> 34:09.256
Public libraries in Britain, of course, have long applied that in that they are completely limited by space.

34:09.537 --> 34:18.347
They cannot get extra space, and they're part of a cooperative network that does ensure that last copies are retained and are accessible.

34:19.068 --> 34:23.694
But national libraries can't really indulge, I don't think, in that kind of activity.

34:23.714 --> 34:30.462
The university library can only do what you're saying because there are national libraries there that ultimately are the last resort back-up.

34:30.965 --> 34:32.807
And it's called the last copy, right?

34:32.907 --> 34:33.648
The last copy.

34:33.668 --> 34:34.689
The last copy, yes.

34:35.570 --> 34:37.472
Who knows where the last copy is?

34:37.752 --> 34:43.037
Well, we do know for quite a lot of Cadiz material where last copies are.

34:43.057 --> 34:45.120
Public libraries actually mark last copy.

34:46.141 --> 34:46.601
Do they?

34:46.681 --> 34:48.383
On the books.

34:49.664 --> 34:57.793
Most of our public libraries... Meaning the last copy in the... Last copy, usually in a region, a geographical region, that's also a public library administrative area.

34:58.834 --> 35:00.195
And that over there, last copy,

35:00.462 --> 35:03.065
And they would normally not get rid of that last copy.

35:03.186 --> 35:04.968
See, we don't do that, I don't think.

35:05.749 --> 35:07.371
I don't think it happens in the U.S.

35:07.411 --> 35:07.791
or not.

35:08.072 --> 35:08.633
Yeah, it doesn't.

35:08.753 --> 35:18.525
Because one of the things we are looking at, that I'm looking at, and Connie is looking at, is selectively books are being gave sessions.

35:19.066 --> 35:23.652
And then you go to OCLC and you can actually do a scan and see who has the book.

35:23.672 --> 35:27.617
And very often you're finding the books, like that was one of the things that Nicholson Bay

35:30.601 --> 35:31.642
find out in the dark.

35:32.203 --> 35:33.524
They were being thrown away.

35:33.564 --> 35:34.665
Guess what?

35:34.865 --> 35:36.407
Maybe only half a dozen of them.

35:36.988 --> 35:40.551
Well, sadly, our system does not work as well as it should do.

35:41.593 --> 35:52.744
We had another book that was written, I can't remember the author and title, I'm afraid, that was about this kind of similar problem in Britain of books disappearing from public libraries.

35:53.265 --> 36:00.152
Public libraries used to have a policy of offering books which they no longer wanted

36:00.706 --> 36:15.345
to the National Library, and we would then identify any that we didn't already hold, and we would add ones that we didn't hold to the National Library stock, and we would offer the native redistribution.

36:16.166 --> 36:21.132
And that worked quite well in the 1950s, 60s, into the 70s for a while.

36:22.114 --> 36:28.722
Then since the 1980s, there's been pressures on public libraries to earn money.

36:29.579 --> 36:31.962
And one way of earning money is to have book sales.

36:32.882 --> 36:45.716
And so almost every public library in Britain now has book sales where they are offering books that are no longer needed for sale to the public.

36:46.597 --> 36:54.385
Some libraries, I hope quite a high proportion of them, will still be exercising that last copy responsibility.

36:55.006 --> 36:56.127
But except for the others,

36:56.579 --> 37:00.405
who are saying, well, I'm sorry, you know, it's a nice idea, but you can't do it.

37:01.426 --> 37:04.491
And so some of those last copies will be being sold.

37:05.112 --> 37:09.438
They find themselves eventually into secondhand bookshops.

37:09.458 --> 37:15.146
And someone did a survey of X library items in secondhand bookshops.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.328
Is this a published survey?

37:16.348 --> 37:16.769
Yes.

37:17.249 --> 37:19.853
Can I write you a book?

37:19.873 --> 37:25.101
Maybe somebody could direct me to that.

37:25.334 --> 37:27.877
I just remember there being a debate about this.

37:27.917 --> 37:31.401
But it indicated what we were going to say.

37:31.421 --> 37:40.231
And they did this survey and they found that a lot of books that had been in public libraries and weren't accessible anymore had found their way into the book trade.

37:42.114 --> 37:51.865
My own copy of Dividend's Bibliomania, the second plan, which is 1830s and 40s, something like that, was the accession by the conquered public libraries.

37:52.722 --> 37:55.025
which I got from a second-hand bookstore.

37:55.365 --> 37:58.369
This book may well have been handled by Emerson.

37:58.789 --> 38:03.195
It was there, and they deaccessioned it.

38:03.515 --> 38:10.604
I mean, one of the embarrassments in our own past is that the British Museum Library used to deaccession material in the early 19th century.

38:11.625 --> 38:15.450
And it's deaccessioned things which nowadays are priceless.

38:15.470 --> 38:17.452
Because someone said, oh, we've already got a copy of this.

38:17.472 --> 38:19.535
You don't need a second copy.

38:19.555 --> 38:21.497
And this went back to some

38:21.781 --> 38:23.123
really important work.

38:23.764 --> 38:27.509
Didn't Bodley have to go and try and get their own first folio back?

38:27.669 --> 38:29.131
I think they probably did, yeah.

38:29.452 --> 38:33.858
So there's all sorts of, you know, very difficult kind of skeletons in the cupboard there.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.501
Well, even Peaks, I'm sorry.

38:35.521 --> 38:43.872
That's one of the things that has led many of the big research libraries in Britain to be very wary about repeating these mistakes from the past.

38:44.934 --> 38:48.619
Well, Samuel Peaks went up from a first folio, I think, to a third.

38:49.340 --> 38:49.881
You know, it was

38:50.587 --> 38:57.018
more accurate, I guess, because he didn't have any concept of the value of a book, I guess.

38:57.038 --> 39:01.585
And that phrase, self-renewing libraries, was that an official phrase?

39:01.625 --> 39:03.148
That was actually an official phrase.

39:03.468 --> 39:07.675
A report was produced by a committee called the Atkinson Committee.

39:07.695 --> 39:08.998
The Atkinson Committee.

39:09.018 --> 39:10.079
I love that.

39:10.099 --> 39:14.687
About 1977, 78, somewhere around there.

39:16.642 --> 39:23.510
It was for the university grant committee, I think it was produced, which was the body that used to run British universities.

39:23.530 --> 39:26.794
So if we add X numbers, we have to read X numbers.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.778
That's right.

39:30.619 --> 39:31.540
That's great.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.884
There was much controversy, as you can imagine, about this in the UK.

39:34.904 --> 39:38.548
Do you have any questions?

39:38.568 --> 39:39.710
Yeah.

39:40.270 --> 39:44.235
We did cover the... So tell me about the new facility.

39:44.654 --> 39:47.957
This is designed clearly for the future.

39:50.180 --> 39:50.960
For hundreds of years.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.422
And not just as a, I'm sorry?

39:52.662 --> 39:53.443
For hundreds of years.

39:53.463 --> 39:54.184
Hundreds of years.

39:54.204 --> 39:56.466
It's going to last, yeah.

39:56.486 --> 40:07.137
And it's, you know, tremendously inspiring, but also strong and sturdy and lasting building.

40:07.377 --> 40:10.560
Built of very fine material by craftsmen.

40:11.249 --> 40:16.336
Some say it's the last, what will be the last great craftsman building in Britain.

40:18.178 --> 40:22.605
We're going to see it this afternoon, so I'm quite sure.

40:22.825 --> 40:28.473
I think it's changing very fast now because the final building works are happening inside.

40:29.093 --> 40:35.322
And so week after week, new vistas are opened up to us inside that are quite staggering.

40:35.702 --> 40:38.286
I mean, we're all really very excited by it.

40:38.671 --> 40:43.198
And we think readers are going to be completely overwhelmed once they get in there.

40:43.218 --> 40:47.464
Could you give me some examples of what really impressed you in terms of the fashion trip?

40:47.985 --> 40:57.318
Well, I think what's impressed me most of all is the feeling in the humanities reading room area, which you may not be able to go to this afternoon.

40:57.338 --> 41:03.868
It's what we call a completion phase, the second part of the building, which is just finally being finished now.

41:04.152 --> 41:09.760
And we've got three reading rooms with two step reading rooms above.

41:11.342 --> 41:13.745
Fantastic, beautiful, high ceilings.

41:15.227 --> 41:18.612
Beautiful desks, wood, marble around.

41:19.373 --> 41:20.995
And you can just be there.

41:21.556 --> 41:25.241
Many people compare it to a modern cathedral in terms of its feel.

41:25.782 --> 41:28.646
The light has been very cleverly planned in the whole building.

41:28.927 --> 41:32.151
The architect has been very subtle.

41:32.806 --> 41:40.816
in finding ways of bringing natural light in without it actually shining directly onto books and desks and people.

41:41.477 --> 41:50.488
So it feels incredibly light, even though you can't just look around actually see, you know, windows and so on.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.148
Come in, Alex.

41:52.070 --> 41:54.092
I think Alex is the person you're going to hear.

41:54.192 --> 41:54.993
It's Alex Bichastner.

41:55.013 --> 41:55.294
How do you do?

41:55.314 --> 41:56.996
Nick Bichastner, my wife's funny.

41:57.016 --> 41:57.616
How do you do?

41:57.636 --> 41:58.137
Nice to meet you.

41:58.157 --> 42:02.222
Just sit down a moment, Alex, and I'll just let you know how our discussion has been done.

42:02.506 --> 42:16.221
And I'd say I think you've given us a good... We've just been talking very generally around some of the themes of what's happening in libraries in the UK and what's happening in the British Library.

42:16.861 --> 42:21.286
I've just been saying a bit about the fantastic inspiration of what this is, Pancras.

42:21.687 --> 42:25.170
Nicholas and Connie are going there this afternoon and we'll see something on it.

42:26.332 --> 42:29.475
Alice is in charge of our special collection.

42:29.742 --> 42:38.031
which means all the manuscripts, music, the maps, our found collections, what else, Alice?

42:38.091 --> 42:40.234
The Oriental and India.

42:40.274 --> 42:44.739
So she can add to what I've been saying, looking at some of those special areas.

42:44.759 --> 42:50.806
There are many of the points you've been making, particularly important points.

42:50.826 --> 42:58.855
We've been talking about the issues of how far we can conserve everything, how far digitization can provide answers.

42:59.155 --> 43:03.419
What do we do when things have got such a bad condition that they're not going to last?

43:04.320 --> 43:13.168
Do we give them euthanasia or do we keep them going for as long as we possibly can in the hope that the magic cure will come?

43:17.512 --> 43:22.817
I look forward to your book when it comes out in due course.

43:22.837 --> 43:27.982
As you can see, it's a general but I hope also specific.

43:28.002 --> 43:28.082
Yes.

43:28.973 --> 43:31.855
On the eve of a new millennium, that's the point.

43:31.936 --> 43:34.758
We talked about Alexandria a bit and going around in a full circle.

43:34.838 --> 43:40.263
And we just begin to dip our toes into the electronic libraries and so on.

43:40.843 --> 43:43.345
But you can do that one a bit further with Alex.

43:43.385 --> 43:58.238
Alex is the whole spectrum, really, right from the great, fantastic, traditional, historic collection that we have here, right through on the sound side, Alex is responsible for as well, where we're at the other extreme in terms of how do you handle

43:58.505 --> 44:19.905
You don't have here, in the UK, I don't think, and this is just a general observation, you don't have a kind of debate raging here, I don't think, as we have in the United States, over the literary canon, you know, believe it or not, Shakespeare, people are actually asking

44:20.543 --> 44:21.825
Is Shakespeare relevant?

44:22.025 --> 44:24.909
You know, do we have to teach Shakespeare in English for it?

44:25.049 --> 44:27.513
It's preposterous, you know, that question should be.

44:27.533 --> 44:30.877
Alex was involved in helping to plan our national curriculum for education.

44:30.977 --> 44:31.959
Oh, I would love to.

44:31.979 --> 44:35.243
You can talk a bit more to Alex about some of these complex issues.

44:35.303 --> 44:36.365
The national curriculum.

44:36.385 --> 44:43.214
I just read in today's paper what I thought was rather amusing revelation about an Australian book.

44:43.234 --> 44:44.416
Have you seen in today's paper?

44:44.536 --> 44:45.517
No, I haven't.

44:45.537 --> 44:47.580
It was an Australian book by...

44:47.915 --> 44:53.341
an Australian Aboriginal woman that won lots of prize in Australia.

44:53.442 --> 44:57.586
It's about this woman's upbringing and her own background.

44:57.607 --> 45:04.375
And unfortunately, it's actually a white middle-aged man that wrote this book.

45:04.395 --> 45:06.978
Which one were you at the time?

45:07.158 --> 45:08.560
I saw it in the Telegraph.

45:08.780 --> 45:10.682
But I'm sure it will feature in all of them.

45:10.932 --> 45:13.938
I mean, the Australians tend to go to these great hoaxes and so on.

45:14.399 --> 45:22.154
But it just reminds me a bit about some of these problems of what is politically correct literature and information.

45:22.235 --> 45:25.301
Yes, I think that's that purpose before.

45:25.421 --> 45:32.535
Anyway, the book I mentioned about what the planet goes in, I've got it at home.

45:32.819 --> 45:34.985
I will email you for details.

45:35.005 --> 45:35.968
Can I give you my card?

45:36.048 --> 45:36.710
Let me do that.

45:37.251 --> 45:38.795
I think I've already got your email address.

45:38.815 --> 45:40.139
I'll give you my card anyway.

45:40.159 --> 45:40.961
I can send it to you.

45:40.981 --> 45:43.268
It does have the email address on it.

45:43.288 --> 45:44.070
Thank you so much.

45:44.270 --> 45:46.356
Can you think of any other...
