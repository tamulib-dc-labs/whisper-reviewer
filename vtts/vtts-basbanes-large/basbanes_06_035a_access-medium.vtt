WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:06.383
It becomes electrical.

00:06.443 --> 00:19.710
Dr. Howard Gottlieb.

01:00.781 --> 01:16.789
The archive, as you said, about 4,000 documents.

01:17.190 --> 01:23.160
The entire collection is about 4,000 documents, and we've only shown several hundred, actually.

01:25.435 --> 01:28.720
And this, of course, is one of Mr. Richards' rooms, isn't that right?

01:29.861 --> 01:37.191
Look, he invented Henry VII.

01:37.352 --> 01:38.653
Wow.

01:38.673 --> 01:39.374
Henry IV.

01:39.394 --> 01:41.678
Oh, Henry IV, yes.

01:41.918 --> 01:45.122
This is the man who invented the silhouette.

01:46.004 --> 01:47.125
Etienne de Silhouette.

01:47.766 --> 01:48.307
That's his name?

01:48.507 --> 01:48.707
Yes.

01:49.288 --> 01:50.470
Monsieur Silhouette.

01:50.570 --> 01:50.650
Yes.

01:50.849 --> 01:59.858
A-T-N-E-T-I-E-N-N-E-D-E-S-I-L-H-O-U-E-T-T-E 1709-1767.

02:00.979 --> 02:01.980
Napoleon Bonaparte?

02:02.681 --> 02:02.861
Yes.

02:03.221 --> 02:06.945
It is the only known poster of Lincoln's Assassin.

02:06.965 --> 02:07.986
The wanted poster.

02:08.286 --> 02:08.707
That's it?

02:08.767 --> 02:09.448
The only known?

02:09.488 --> 02:10.328
The only known, yeah.

02:11.169 --> 02:11.490
Really.

02:12.190 --> 02:13.211
And Paul had this?

02:15.414 --> 02:15.494
Yes.

02:15.514 --> 02:17.676
Poster issued by the— There's no hours now.

02:17.696 --> 02:18.557
This is not the project.

02:18.577 --> 02:19.277
This is a gift.

02:19.438 --> 02:20.839
This is a hundred—really?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.165
Paul was rather extraordinary.

02:24.265 --> 02:24.666
Really?

02:25.487 --> 02:25.767
You?

02:27.730 --> 02:31.935
I might ask you to tell me a little bit about Paul as a collector, too.

02:33.157 --> 02:34.699
Paul did say he talked to me, by the way.

02:34.719 --> 02:35.940
Sorry, I'm a New York fan.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.322
That'll be interesting.

02:37.362 --> 02:38.884
There's a success story for you.

02:39.645 --> 02:42.549
There's the Texas story.

02:42.569 --> 02:47.856
In one man, Paul's success is just as phenomenal as Texas was success.

02:48.578 --> 02:49.519
How do you mean?

02:49.539 --> 02:51.060
A man that started out without a penny.

02:51.140 --> 02:57.506
Started out without a penny, is now the largest manuscript dealer and the largest manuscript collector in the country.

02:58.247 --> 02:58.647
You know now.

02:59.488 --> 03:00.689
He still collects for himself.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.053
Incredible.

03:04.073 --> 03:04.893
He just salts away for himself.

03:05.053 --> 03:10.459
But is the idea, do you think, for him to send it here?

03:11.359 --> 03:12.260
Not necessarily.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.602
The Henry Wallace he sent to Iowa.

03:14.622 --> 03:18.366
They've got a Henry Wallace room there because Wallace came from Iowa, you see.

03:18.869 --> 03:23.914
He has done things for other institutions, but also he's totally collected.

03:23.934 --> 03:24.976
He's gone into glass.

03:25.016 --> 03:30.101
He's got the largest collection in the world of glass flasks, mostly 18th and 19th century.

03:30.682 --> 03:35.447
He's now collecting Perrin busts, those little white busts of well-known figures.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.269
He's got 4,000 or 5,000 of those.

03:37.969 --> 03:41.994
He's the world's largest collector of Baden-Powell and Boy Scout material.

03:42.214 --> 03:43.856
He's cornered the market and all of that.

03:43.876 --> 03:45.718
These are personal collections.

03:45.818 --> 03:48.741
I've been told that his Boy Scout collection, when it's

03:49.328 --> 03:51.071
It's really going to be something.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.255
Extraordinary, yeah.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.758
And everybody would like to get it, too.

04:00.729 --> 04:01.330
This is nice.

04:01.350 --> 04:07.962
We had this opening last week, and Paul came down for the official opening, and

04:08.228 --> 04:09.450
I was in Chicago for that.

04:09.510 --> 04:10.632
Thank you for the invitation.

04:10.652 --> 04:14.397
And it was quite a... Yes, I hope we sent you one.

04:14.417 --> 04:19.305
I've asked them to keep you on our list, you know, because I thought some of these things might or might not interest you, Nick.

04:19.365 --> 04:21.267
If they don't, just ignore it.

04:21.588 --> 04:23.170
You know, you're always welcome to come to this stage.

04:23.190 --> 04:24.312
That one particularly did.

04:24.492 --> 04:28.138
And it was my... Unfortunately, I was in Chicago that week.

04:30.601 --> 04:30.762
In St.

04:30.802 --> 04:31.042
Louis.

04:31.122 --> 04:37.071
Donuts take constant massaging, as you know, in order to keep them interested and keep...

04:37.574 --> 04:40.679
keep their loyalty to the institution.

04:41.280 --> 04:47.650
That is why we mount a show of this nature, just for that purpose.

04:47.670 --> 04:51.916
From Henry VIII to Woodrow Wilson.

04:52.297 --> 05:01.431
We attempted to take the two better names, you see, and that would attract public to go in and... What is the focus of such a collection?

05:01.592 --> 05:03.234
Just significant manuscripts?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.117
Collector items.

05:05.384 --> 05:05.825
That's all.

05:05.985 --> 05:06.546
High spots?

05:06.806 --> 05:07.767
High spots, you know.

05:07.827 --> 05:08.769
He's like Shady.

05:08.829 --> 05:11.272
He's like all Robert Taylor was at Princeton, you know.

05:11.672 --> 05:12.494
Only high spots.

05:12.534 --> 05:13.555
That's all Paul is.

05:13.735 --> 05:15.277
His personal collection is interested.

05:15.558 --> 05:19.082
Whereas when it came to the Roosevelt or the Frost, he was interested in depth.

05:19.864 --> 05:30.698
I mean, the Frost is the largest, most complete Frost collection in the world, as is the Theodore Roosevelt that we have that he gave us.

05:30.718 --> 05:32.340
How do you feel when you see these things?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.702
What kind of feelings do you have?

05:33.922 --> 05:34.343
Possess it.

05:34.744 --> 05:35.104
Really?

05:35.624 --> 05:37.146
totally possesses.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.329
I think that it's a fate that all curators have.

05:39.349 --> 05:41.833
You never talk about, you say, my manuscripts.

05:41.913 --> 05:43.215
These are my Dickens letters.

05:43.235 --> 05:44.517
They're not the universities.

05:44.537 --> 05:46.640
They're my Dickens letters, you know.

05:46.660 --> 05:53.029
I think you'll find that at any institution, any curator begins to feel terribly possessive over something like that.

05:53.049 --> 05:54.130
Well, you are a collector.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.153
I think people should understand that you are.

05:56.834 --> 06:00.740
You and your wife has come to my home sometime to see my personal collection.

06:02.222 --> 06:04.144
I didn't know you collected personally.

06:04.165 --> 06:04.545
Not manuscripts.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.226
I collect

06:05.729 --> 06:09.633
Presentation copies, books that one author give another author.

06:09.873 --> 06:11.014
Those are very interesting.

06:11.374 --> 06:12.635
And I also collect modern art.

06:12.655 --> 06:17.280
I have a very large collection of art.

06:17.660 --> 06:20.543
Presentation and also association, I would say.

06:20.563 --> 06:21.063
Yes, yeah.

06:21.103 --> 06:24.366
Because that's part of the... Yeah.

06:25.647 --> 06:28.770
This is the manuscript of John's straight shooting.

06:28.850 --> 06:29.251
Oh, really?

06:30.171 --> 06:31.773
I thought I'd give him a little plug.

06:31.973 --> 06:34.455
Why not?

06:34.475 --> 06:35.196
He types?

06:35.800 --> 06:39.084
He long hands and then corrects the top script.

06:41.066 --> 06:42.428
It's gone into paperback now.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.031
It did pretty well and qualified.

06:45.071 --> 06:45.612
Very well.

06:50.558 --> 06:53.041
We have a lot of Lawrence manuscripts.

06:53.201 --> 06:56.846
I find that Lawrence, we cannot keep on the shelves in the stack.

06:56.906 --> 06:58.127
Students read Lawrence.

06:58.688 --> 07:00.971
They read Lawrence now the way they used to read Hemingway.

07:01.311 --> 07:03.093
Now they don't read Hemingway, they read Lawrence.

07:03.113 --> 07:04.575
Students, though.

07:06.698 --> 07:09.541
We're talking to Dr. Gottlieb at Boston University.

07:11.844 --> 07:12.524
Where were we?

07:12.564 --> 07:16.449
Let's talk about a very easy thing.

07:16.909 --> 07:21.194
You were mentioning that you started a book collecting competition here.

07:21.915 --> 07:23.176
Yeah.

07:23.196 --> 07:26.299
You might tell me a little bit about that and why you started it.

07:26.319 --> 07:28.742
It's now 20 years old at this institution.

07:28.942 --> 07:34.208
I started it about seven years after I'd been here based on the one that I had

07:34.407 --> 08:03.250
helped run during my Yale period and we find that it is a wonderful way for us to reach out and make collectors or attempt to make collectors out of our student body because I tell the students when I proselytize or get them to enter the contest you can play tennis up to a certain age and football and any physical sport but when you are beyond that stage

08:03.533 --> 08:06.937
You must have something you can do for the rest of your life and book collecting.

08:07.718 --> 08:09.641
Being a collector is the best way to do it.

08:10.182 --> 08:15.509
And interestingly enough, we've found over the years that some of these collections are wonderful.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.850
I'm amazed at the subjects.

08:18.192 --> 08:23.359
Oh, a few years ago we had a boy who collected novels in which the bugle figured.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.301
It was interesting.

08:25.382 --> 08:26.143
Did you ask him?

08:26.823 --> 08:33.372
It was a collection of some 500 books, but a brilliant collection that he had put together that in some way the bugle...

08:34.229 --> 08:35.210
Oh, you know.

08:36.212 --> 08:38.415
And then we've had an extraordinary subject.

08:39.036 --> 08:41.860
One year we had a young man who collected portmanteaux.

08:42.842 --> 08:44.784
Now, I mean, those are extraordinarily rare.

08:44.825 --> 08:53.037
These were the catalogs that itinerant salesmen carried in the 19th century from farmhouse to farmhouse, selling their wares.

08:53.117 --> 08:58.024
And they were beautifully done, beautifully put together, beautifully illustrated, but very rare.

08:58.424 --> 09:03.612
And this was an extraordinary collection of portmanteaux that this young man had.

09:03.845 --> 09:17.659
One year ago presented a book collection she put together of watch repair manuals, some from the 18th century right up to the present time, because she just happened to be interested.

09:17.960 --> 09:25.087
So it can be an author collection or it can be a subject collection, as long as they show sense and a theme.

09:25.648 --> 09:30.713
And then what we ask them to do is write an essay on how they came to acquire their book,

09:31.115 --> 09:33.458
and why they are collecting in that field.

09:33.498 --> 09:41.968
And that's what the judges, we appoint three judges, usually one book dealer, usually one member of the faculty, and usually a member of the friends of the library.

09:42.369 --> 09:43.530
And they pick a window.

09:43.550 --> 09:49.778
We give $800 for the first prize, and $600 for the second, $400 for the third, and so it's worthwhile to enter.

09:49.878 --> 09:51.460
And it's open to undergraduates only?

09:51.600 --> 09:53.222
No, to anyone in the university.

09:53.402 --> 09:53.723
Really?

09:53.903 --> 09:55.585
I'm a great believer in that, yes.

09:56.306 --> 09:57.187
Not just undergraduates?

09:57.207 --> 09:58.168
Not just undergraduates.

09:58.317 --> 10:00.502
What's your thinking on that?

10:00.923 --> 10:13.010
Because I feel that graduate students and students in our professional schools who devoted a certain number of years to collecting should be rewarded for their collecting activities as well.

10:13.752 --> 10:16.157
We reserve, we want to make sure that

10:17.048 --> 10:20.131
A first-year undergraduate always gets a prize.

10:20.572 --> 10:24.055
So at least one of the prizes is reserved for undergraduate.

10:24.075 --> 10:24.936
That's what they do at Chicago.

10:24.956 --> 10:28.219
They give one to a senior and one to a freshman or a sophomore.

10:28.239 --> 10:31.483
So that's, you know... And each year the number who enter varies.

10:31.543 --> 10:36.308
Some year we have 40, some year we have 30, some year we have 50, you know.

10:36.328 --> 10:41.453
You had mentioned earlier during lunch that the first year a young man

10:41.990 --> 10:46.214
collected Joyce, and they said his collection was probably better than the one we had in the library.

10:46.234 --> 10:47.515
I would have been proud to have it here.

10:47.815 --> 10:51.338
And he may have not have spent more than $50 on putting that together.

10:52.058 --> 10:58.564
But he picked up things like poems penny each for 25 cents from a dealer who didn't know what he had, you see.

10:58.864 --> 10:59.445
And that's how.

10:59.545 --> 11:00.646
He was really a collector.

11:00.686 --> 11:05.810
He even had two ticket stubs from a Joyce performance he had attended.

11:06.210 --> 11:08.232
He had a real collector's instinct.

11:08.632 --> 11:11.895
Do you do any follow-up on these students?

11:12.061 --> 11:30.578
The Book of the Month Club, in conjunction with Bennett Cerf, used to award a national prize for the winners of university prizes, and they called it the Amy Loveman Book Award, awarded jointly by Book of the Month Club and Random House.

11:31.138 --> 11:36.763
Now, that went on for a number of years, and their first prize was $1,000, so that was something.

11:36.903 --> 11:40.046
We used to enter our winners in that national contest.

11:40.687 --> 11:42.068
Then, for some reason,

11:42.571 --> 11:45.516
That contest fell apart.

11:45.536 --> 11:47.919
I'm going to call the Book of the Month Club.

11:47.939 --> 11:49.061
I wonder what happened to that.

11:50.123 --> 11:57.233
But I mean, follow up with respect to the fact that, you know, the kid graduates from college and goes out.

11:57.714 --> 12:00.038
One assumes the individual continues to collect.

12:00.699 --> 12:04.665
It might be worth your while to keep tabs on the individual.

12:04.685 --> 12:10.654
Become James Billings, one of the big book dealers in New York who won the contest here when he was a student.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.406
Now he's an important rare book dealer.

12:13.746 --> 12:15.207
Bill Reese won the one at Yale.

12:15.287 --> 12:15.788
At Yale.

12:15.988 --> 12:19.351
And Bill is the big man in Western Americana, yes.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.712
And Graham Arata won.

12:21.813 --> 12:27.078
That's the other side of the two individuals.

12:27.098 --> 12:31.502
There's a fellow who just founded one at the University of Chicago, Brooker, who won the Yale Award.

12:31.522 --> 12:34.725
He's quite a collector of 16th century stuff.

12:34.745 --> 12:38.148
You said downstairs, I said, how do you feel when you're walking among the Richards?

12:39.289 --> 12:40.270
And you said, possessive.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.424
He sent a request.

12:43.444 --> 12:43.664
I think so.

12:43.684 --> 12:44.085
You do.

12:44.846 --> 13:00.087
At least, maybe not all curators, but I put so much of my life, my time and energy and years, having started a collection from scratch here, it's a little different perhaps than from at other places, when it inherited a collection, you see, and added to it.

13:00.307 --> 13:07.337
This was created, in a sense, during my watch, during the time that I have been here, so I feel it's all mine.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.643
You started about 63, 64?

13:09.663 --> 13:09.723
63.

13:10.024 --> 13:10.825
Okay.

13:12.147 --> 13:21.661
That was about the time, maybe five years after Texas started putting together a 20th century kind of archive.

13:24.064 --> 13:31.255
Tell me a little bit about why you decided a 20th century collection was important, why that was something that you thought you could do here.

13:31.455 --> 13:33.578
Because when I was wooed away to come here,

13:34.351 --> 13:35.372
to create a collection.

13:35.472 --> 13:39.618
I knew that the competition would be with sister institutions across the river and elsewhere.

13:39.838 --> 13:41.660
We'd been collecting for hundreds of years.

13:42.281 --> 13:58.682
How could Boston University, with few funds, which they had, no funds for me to work with, make a mark as a collecting agency or as a research center, unless we collected in some field where we would be rendering a service that no other agency was rendering.

13:59.183 --> 14:03.008
And there really was no college, no university, no repository

14:03.292 --> 14:09.224
who said, this is my territory, contemporary papers, the 20th century, in all fields.

14:09.345 --> 14:17.301
I did not limit us to literature alone, but to the other cultural arts, to politics, to music, to drama.

14:17.787 --> 14:19.228
to civil rights.

14:19.248 --> 14:19.829
Journalism.

14:19.889 --> 14:22.031
I see a picture of Dan Rather.

14:22.091 --> 14:23.052
Those are all his Emmys.

14:23.312 --> 14:24.874
Those are Dan's Emmys right there.

14:25.434 --> 14:27.737
And Dan Rather is a born collector.

14:27.777 --> 14:29.138
Dan is a born collector.

14:29.238 --> 14:36.285
Every other week I get a parcel from him of materials that he sends because he is a born collector.

14:37.486 --> 14:39.608
How did you get Dan Rather, for instance?

14:39.748 --> 14:40.689
He's from Texas.

14:40.769 --> 14:42.150
He works in New York.

14:42.170 --> 14:42.971
How is it he picks?

14:43.792 --> 14:44.192
I don't know.

14:44.653 --> 14:47.035
Maybe my pursuit

14:47.217 --> 14:56.089
Maybe my courtship was a little more ardent than the Library of Congress, who wanted him badly, or some other institutions.

14:56.410 --> 14:56.870
I don't know.

14:57.531 --> 14:58.793
People ask me that all the time.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.035
How did you get so-and-so?

15:00.856 --> 15:07.585
I think if there's any answer to that or to what I do, it's only one thing, and that is persistence.

15:08.186 --> 15:10.649
Well, you used the word courtship.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.033
Tell me, why don't you expand a little bit on that?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.014
It is a courtship.

15:14.054 --> 15:14.655
It's wooing.

15:15.136 --> 15:16.077
It's massaging.

15:16.529 --> 15:17.851
It's caring for.

15:18.512 --> 15:19.474
It's administering.

15:19.734 --> 15:28.208
It's a long period of ambitious desire, in a sense.

15:28.228 --> 15:32.996
I think that it's easy if someone says no to say, yes, that is finished.

15:33.096 --> 15:36.040
But if someone says no to me and they say, I have no papers.

15:36.401 --> 15:37.944
I've destroyed all my diaries.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.887
I've destroyed all my letters.

15:39.947 --> 15:43.212
My first reaction is one of disbelief, constantly.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.859
People do not destroy things so cavalierly.

15:45.919 --> 15:46.500
I know that.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.584
I haven't been an archivist for 30 years not to know that, you see.

15:51.225 --> 15:51.825
At any rate.

15:52.005 --> 15:54.728
So what's the next step if somebody says they've destroyed it?

15:56.049 --> 16:03.777
The next step is to make sure that that individual knows that I'm waiting in the wings.

16:04.477 --> 16:05.038
And you care.

16:05.559 --> 16:08.882
And that I am constantly interested.

16:11.324 --> 16:13.266
And to...

16:13.600 --> 16:14.221
Pursue it.

16:15.502 --> 16:17.245
We recently had an exercise.

16:17.325 --> 16:32.404
Maybe this is telling something out of school, but this past summer we took a period of time here for me to be in touch with everyone who has refused me in the last 20 years, if they are still alive.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.228
And that was done this summer.

16:35.548 --> 16:41.616
I put myself in touch with some 3,000 or 4,000 people.

16:42.727 --> 16:49.193
And just to see, merely just to see what would happen.

16:50.675 --> 16:53.918
And we got some very good collections after all this time.

16:54.658 --> 17:02.105
Number one, they were amazed that one remembered that one had been in touch again after all this time.

17:02.946 --> 17:04.187
And some had changed their minds.

17:04.328 --> 17:08.091
Some let me know that they had decided on another repository, another institution.

17:08.151 --> 17:10.033
And fine, as long as the papers were safe.

17:10.469 --> 17:17.358
I'm the sort of archivist who doesn't necessarily feel it's got to be here, but I do feel it's got to be someplace being cared for.

17:17.838 --> 17:20.442
I worry about collections in private hands.

17:20.562 --> 17:24.647
I think they should be someplace, if not here, at least in another repository.

17:25.468 --> 17:28.973
Who do you think would be worthwhile my talking to in that regard?

17:29.673 --> 17:40.307
Not necessarily that regard, but somebody who could speak to, who might be interested in talking about how they decided to place a collection with you after maybe

17:40.523 --> 17:41.865
deciding not to put it anywhere.

17:42.906 --> 17:44.869
If you think of anybody, it might be worth my while.

17:47.933 --> 17:48.594
Think about that.

17:48.794 --> 17:49.695
Yeah.

17:49.795 --> 17:52.119
Am I talking to someone?

17:52.159 --> 17:54.522
What made you decide?

17:54.602 --> 17:58.848
Actually, someone who just came to mind, who I find a very interesting writer.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.471
Some people call him a regional writer.

18:01.571 --> 18:02.853
I think he is more national.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.916
That is Billy C. Clark from Tennessee.

18:06.658 --> 18:10.243
Old Yeller and many of his other books he writes about.

18:10.510 --> 18:12.432
The country, dogs, animals.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.194
He's a very fine writer.

18:14.895 --> 18:22.063
Now, he has came to us this past summer after many, many, many years of wooing.

18:26.488 --> 18:30.472
If you can... Sure.

18:30.492 --> 18:31.333
You were wooed here.

18:31.373 --> 18:33.896
You used the word wooed.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.258
Yeah.

18:35.558 --> 18:36.979
You were at Yale, I guess, at that time.

18:36.999 --> 18:38.221
Yeah.

18:38.741 --> 18:39.302
And they said...

18:39.603 --> 18:44.991
Dr. Gottlieb, please come to Boston University, and your mandate is to build a great collection.

18:45.352 --> 18:46.353
That's right.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.658
But was there also a codicil to that, that we don't have much money?

18:50.840 --> 18:57.269
I mean, the point is, if you... It wasn't put to me in exactly those terms, but it was a fact that I discovered very rapidly.

18:57.289 --> 19:05.301
I mean, one of the inducements would have to be that you, well, we'll give you the need, you know, certainly you'll have the needs to do.

19:05.321 --> 19:09.087
Or was it understood that you were really going to exploit everything that you never learned?

19:09.387 --> 19:10.668
Yeah.

19:10.688 --> 19:20.137
I think the greatest inducement was the fact that it could be a totally personalized collection, and that if you stop that way, it has to be.

19:20.978 --> 19:21.078
Yeah.

19:21.098 --> 19:26.263
See, I guess the reason I put it in context with Texas is because you both started out about the same time.

19:26.304 --> 19:27.845
They started out a few years ahead of you.

19:28.766 --> 19:30.908
But what they always had was money.

19:32.490 --> 19:32.590
Yeah.

19:32.610 --> 19:38.095
I mean, why would Alfred A., I'm not asking, but why would Alfred A. come up, send his stuff to Texas?

19:39.003 --> 19:41.506
You know, I mean, but it's there.

19:41.526 --> 19:46.931
And he didn't need money, but... And he didn't need money, but... Oh, but Swanson, after my years of wooing of Miss Swanson.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.393
I tell you that story.

19:48.493 --> 19:54.319
Oh, you know, after all those cranberries and dried dates and figs, weekend after weekend, you know.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.021
She was rich.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.043
I've never seen such an establishment.

19:58.103 --> 20:02.247
That green marble palace on Fifth Avenue was incredible.

20:02.688 --> 20:07.913
And yet they offered her one thing I couldn't do, and that was a lifetime job.

20:08.281 --> 20:14.410
for her assistant or secretary, and money, a million dollars in cash.

20:14.450 --> 20:19.977
They claim it wasn't that much, but that's... I'll go off just for a second.

20:20.458 --> 20:22.801
Let's get back to business then.

20:24.444 --> 20:34.778
I guess, again, talking about the mandate to build a great collection but really not having the money to do it, and yet you did it.

20:35.939 --> 20:37.801
Maybe you can talk a little bit about that.

20:37.882 --> 20:39.383
I'd much rather have been the other way.

20:39.424 --> 20:42.287
I would have loved to have gone to the auction houses.

20:42.327 --> 20:44.110
I would have loved to have hired Lou Feldman.

20:44.570 --> 20:51.800
I would have loved to have hired, you know, Kuschenbaum or Fleming or any of them to have worked for us to find us things.

20:52.861 --> 21:01.272
But they, during this period, always sent their catalogs hoping that we would buy something, but we could not afford to buy from them.

21:01.673 --> 21:10.266
or to buy anything at auction, except on those occasions when I went to a member of the Friends of the Library and said, I know such and such a book.

21:10.326 --> 21:11.929
Is it such and such a house?

21:12.289 --> 21:12.990
Buy it for us.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.252
I'll go to the auction and bid.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.154
And they did.

21:15.194 --> 21:25.570
This organization, which I created in 63, 64, the Friends of the Library, is now very strong and very active and very loyal.

21:26.030 --> 21:28.474
But even in the early years, they started buying

21:28.792 --> 21:34.478
because they wanted to be in on the beginning to see if we really could create an important collection here, which we have done.

21:35.159 --> 21:36.741
But it's not easy to do it that way.

21:36.801 --> 21:39.524
It is extremely hard, because you have to collect people.

21:40.025 --> 21:41.606
You have to collect people with money.

21:42.027 --> 21:43.749
You have to collect collectors.

21:44.229 --> 21:45.271
And that is not easy.

21:45.291 --> 21:50.196
It's much easier to go into a shop and buy something or go to an auction house and buy a group of papers.

21:50.617 --> 21:52.699
But to get it this way is doubly hard.

21:52.719 --> 21:53.800
Tell me about collecting people.

21:53.860 --> 21:58.005
Now, Betty Davis has been in the news quite a bit lately, and she's certainly...

21:58.542 --> 22:00.084
That's an extraordinary collection.

22:00.684 --> 22:04.528
It's your privilege to be custodian out here at Boston University.

22:04.548 --> 22:09.573
Tell me a little bit about how she decided to give your... It took her ten years to decide.

22:10.133 --> 22:18.982
It took ten years of abject begging to get her to decide because she knew exactly what her worth was.

22:19.503 --> 22:27.030
She knew she was not only turning over her own archive, her own collection, her book collection, but she was turning over her reputation, her name as well.

22:27.348 --> 22:32.136
Because if you place your papers in a repository, you are saying, that is my institution.

22:32.616 --> 22:36.783
My reputation, in a sense, is bound up with that of the institution.

22:36.803 --> 22:48.602
And that is one of the reasons why my task became so much easier when Silber came here to become president, because he started doing things with the university that were tremendously different than what had happened here before.

22:48.642 --> 22:52.528
He took the university, shook it, turned its own head, set it on a different path.

22:52.762 --> 23:01.375
And so when I would go to London, I didn't have to explain that we weren't small and Jesuit and in Chester Hill, but that we were large and architectarian and in Boston.

23:01.736 --> 23:04.299
People knew who we were for the first time, you see.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.745
And this helped along the way.

23:07.985 --> 23:19.843
But between 63 and 71, when John came here, I had to fight this lonely battle to a great extent, traveling and telling people where we were, who we were, and what we were trying to do.

23:20.404 --> 23:22.026
But once he became president,

23:22.343 --> 23:25.686
I didn't have to do so much of that, because he began hitting the newspapers.

23:26.007 --> 23:29.050
He began making waves, you see, and it's all helped.

23:29.070 --> 23:31.112
And he would travel with me on occasion.

23:31.412 --> 23:32.633
We'd go out to Hollywood.

23:33.034 --> 23:38.699
George Sidney would give a dinner for him out in Hollywood, you know, and it's all worked out very well.

23:38.719 --> 23:40.321
Did he give you a mandate when he came in?

23:41.782 --> 23:49.330
I must say, he's an extraordinary man, because he came from a tradition of collecting at Texas, and he saw what Ransom had done there.

23:49.816 --> 24:08.782
So he didn't come in and say, I wonder what's going on with Gottlieb and what he's trying to do, because he knew that I, in my own way, was trying to do what Ransom had done at Texas, you see, build a large research center, except Ransom had a great deal of help in the way of money, and I didn't have that help.

24:09.403 --> 24:12.848
But I must say, he has been a good right arm.

24:13.068 --> 24:17.815
It's been extraordinary because he is wonderful with the people that I'm dealing with,

24:18.098 --> 24:23.864
They enjoy meeting and talking with him, and he's been extraordinarily helpful right along the way.

24:23.884 --> 24:27.747
Do you want to use another metaphor on that, honestly, another right arm?

24:27.767 --> 24:30.170
I'm not, I mean, no, no, I'm being serious.

24:31.411 --> 24:32.432
I mean, that doesn't matter.

24:32.452 --> 24:34.153
He's been my greatest aid, really.

24:34.394 --> 24:35.795
Your greatest ally or whatever.

24:35.815 --> 24:36.075
Yes.

24:37.497 --> 24:37.597
Yeah.

24:37.617 --> 24:38.157
And a great ally.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.379
I just don't want anybody to... Oh, no, yes.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.322
I mean, I'm not even conscious of that because it never occurs.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.304
You get so used to something you don't even know...

24:45.554 --> 24:48.438
And I'm always amazed when people even mention it to me.

24:48.458 --> 24:53.324
No, I'm a cynic who writes things, and I see things as they appear in print.

24:53.344 --> 24:54.085
You know what I'm saying?

24:55.286 --> 24:56.247
Yes.

24:56.588 --> 24:57.249
Oh, absolutely.

24:57.349 --> 24:57.769
I agree.

24:58.050 --> 24:59.492
I agree with you 100%.

24:59.532 --> 25:11.747
But he gave you... No, because he's eclectic, he's eclectic in his own reading interest, and in his own knowledge of authors.

25:11.980 --> 25:16.227
He constantly amazes me as to how much he knows about books and authors.

25:16.247 --> 25:19.552
How important is a research facility to a university?

25:19.933 --> 25:20.834
Terribly important.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.877
How do you attract good faculty?

25:22.897 --> 25:24.780
How do you attract good students?

25:25.121 --> 25:30.289
How do you attract external scholars to come here and work and lend their name to the university?

25:30.990 --> 25:34.416
The books and papers are what bring people here, quite frankly.

25:35.918 --> 25:37.060
And being in Boston helps.

25:37.512 --> 25:40.356
You must have a lot of complementary kinds of collections.

25:40.436 --> 25:46.485
You must have things that the public library has that help a scholar... Yes, but only in books, not in papers.

25:47.005 --> 25:49.088
There's been a sort of unspoken rule.

25:49.509 --> 25:59.123
Boston Public takes care of the local city politicians whose papers are in the Boston Public and Boston City-orientated materials.

25:59.703 --> 26:02.928
They do not collect in the area that we are collecting.

26:03.409 --> 26:04.330
Harvard, by...

26:04.529 --> 26:09.996
Its tradition collects primarily 18th and 19th century material, maybe a bit of 20th now.

26:10.396 --> 26:15.382
But really, we have not trod on each other's toes to a great extent.

26:15.402 --> 26:20.288
Though I do hear cries of anguish, oh, from other institutions periodically.

26:20.468 --> 26:23.892
Kennedy Library saying, why did the John McCormick papers go there?

26:24.293 --> 26:26.596
They should have come to us.

26:27.637 --> 26:30.881
Or Harvard saying, why has the Benchley papers gone to you?

26:30.901 --> 26:32.022
He was a Harvard man.

26:32.474 --> 26:34.998
Could have gone to Harvard had they asked for them.

26:37.302 --> 26:37.662
I'm sure.

26:37.702 --> 26:39.265
There's a sense of timing.

26:39.285 --> 26:40.327
A sense of timing.

26:41.088 --> 26:41.569
Nuance.

26:41.689 --> 26:43.892
I think you have to be alert to the nuances, don't you?

26:43.912 --> 26:44.553
Yes, yes, yes.

26:44.814 --> 26:47.037
And a sense of overwhelming ambition, really.

26:47.739 --> 26:48.600
And that's what counts.

26:49.181 --> 26:58.015
Now, I read in the New York Times a couple weeks ago that Emory University in Atlanta has come up with hundreds of millions of dollars of Coca-Cola money.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.157
One hundred and nine million.

26:59.727 --> 27:03.332
And they're stealing faculty from Johns Hopkins.

27:03.853 --> 27:12.545
I wonder, would a concomitant thrust also be in the building of a wreath?

27:12.625 --> 27:13.646
We have not heard that.

27:14.227 --> 27:16.030
They have not entered the auction market.

27:16.671 --> 27:18.733
They have not entered the antiquarian market.

27:18.874 --> 27:23.440
One knows immediately, once you have an element of that nature,

27:24.787 --> 27:25.948
Nothing of that has occurred.

27:25.988 --> 27:27.309
There's no reason why they could.

27:27.329 --> 27:42.263
But my question is, and we're just using that as an example, assuming they wish to be a great university, something more than a fine university in Georgia, in your view, do they have to build a really fine research collection in something?

27:42.944 --> 27:44.385
Is it incumbent upon them to do that?

27:44.425 --> 27:44.905
They do.

27:45.926 --> 27:49.670
The library is the heart of any university.

27:49.690 --> 27:51.872
And we're not talking about just printed books.

27:52.152 --> 27:52.212
No.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.822
The library is the heart of any university.

27:55.862 --> 27:59.926
It is the one thing that makes the corpus of that university beat.

27:59.946 --> 28:03.409
It is the one facility that everyone on that campus uses.

28:04.830 --> 28:08.053
And consequently, that's what makes you a great university.

28:09.294 --> 28:11.716
And why is Harvard so proud of its library?

28:11.796 --> 28:13.618
Why is Yale so proud of its library?

28:13.678 --> 28:22.806
These are institutions which those universities have nurtured over the years and which attracts people from all over the world to use those facilities.

28:23.326 --> 28:32.738
Would we get five or six thousand scholars from around the world coming to us now if we did not have something they could not find anywhere else?

28:33.298 --> 28:35.281
The only reason that would bring them here.

28:39.346 --> 28:41.669
There's something we mentioned earlier that I want to go back to.

28:43.992 --> 28:44.472
Yeah, living.

28:44.532 --> 28:48.838
The decision to collect the artifacts of the living.

28:48.898 --> 28:50.700
It was kind of a revolutionary...

28:51.372 --> 28:52.574
decision to make, wasn't it?

28:52.594 --> 28:53.455
I mean, that wasn't really done.

28:53.475 --> 29:05.352
Yeah, because would you take a chance of talking to the person next to you and saying, I want to collect you, if you have no assurance that person's going to end up being well-known or famous or being collectible, if you can use that term?

29:05.832 --> 29:20.333
And I'm sure if you walked outside this building and stopped the first person on the street you met, you would find that that person has saved papers, has saved letters from his mother and father or from her aunt or her uncle or her report cards or her passports or her driver's licenses.

29:20.532 --> 29:21.654
But do you want to save them?

29:22.335 --> 29:24.919
That prison may not turn out to be terribly important.

29:25.319 --> 29:33.512
And that's the tragedy of life, you know, because if we had that kind of material from someone from the 16th or 17th century, that would be historic and very interesting.

29:34.013 --> 29:38.379
But modern technology, you see, has caught up with collecting activity.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.905
We know about what is going on now through other means.

29:41.925 --> 29:47.333
There's no reason to save it from the actual flagstones of our age, because we can save it in

29:47.482 --> 29:51.388
much more manageable form to a great extent.

29:51.408 --> 30:01.986
Nicholas Barker, I said, you know, we discussed one of the purported pitfalls of collecting people who are unknown and who may remain unknown.

30:02.426 --> 30:07.334
He said, you know, we're just discovering poets now from the 16th century here in the British Library.

30:07.835 --> 30:13.224
You know, they've never been, but we're getting to them, and we're discovering that they're important, and we're delighted that we have their works here.

30:13.665 --> 30:14.586
So who's to say?

30:14.785 --> 30:22.055
But yet, at the end of the 19th century, they wouldn't collect Alfred Lord Tennyson, because they were afraid he wasn't well-known, and he might not amount to anything, you see.

30:22.075 --> 30:29.766
Well, Oxford, Julian Roberts, we were talking about the Don Quixote, which sold for $1.65 million from the garden sale.

30:30.808 --> 30:32.951
And he said, well, you know, we bought ours when it was issued.

30:33.491 --> 30:34.933
Cute.

30:34.954 --> 30:38.318
Look, it was such a marvelous, oh, I love that.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.121
It was such a wonderful ride.

30:40.281 --> 30:43.005
So we had an agent in Spain, and we bought it when it was issued.

30:43.025 --> 30:43.105
Yes.

30:43.270 --> 30:46.396
Oh, I must use that sometimes.

30:46.436 --> 30:47.558
Please, please do.

30:48.540 --> 30:52.548
And then later, he said, however, having said that, he said, we never bought Jane Austen's.

30:52.568 --> 30:55.113
We had to go out and buy Jane Austen's books from dealers.

30:55.133 --> 30:57.277
I'm trying to get a... We never collected her.

30:57.338 --> 30:59.201
Novelists were not collected.

30:59.462 --> 31:00.303
I know, that's true.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.490
I bought Emma last year at an outrageous price.

31:03.530 --> 31:04.532
I'm trying to get Pride and Prejudice.

31:04.552 --> 31:05.734
You know what Pride and Prejudice is?

31:06.085 --> 31:08.167
Eight, nine thousand in first edition.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.770
It's incredible for a novel, you know.

31:10.790 --> 31:10.950
It is.

31:11.050 --> 31:11.811
A printed book?

31:11.891 --> 31:12.612
A printed book.

31:12.952 --> 31:14.293
Tied in Princeton.

31:14.313 --> 31:15.214
Eight or nine thousand.

31:15.234 --> 31:15.615
It's incredible.

31:15.635 --> 31:16.736
Are you willing to pay that much?

31:17.036 --> 31:18.057
I have a donor who is.

31:18.758 --> 31:19.118
Oh, that's right.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.319
If we can find a good copy.

31:20.339 --> 31:21.781
But it has to be a good copy.

31:21.841 --> 31:23.402
Now, is the donor a collector as well?

31:23.823 --> 31:24.023
No.

31:24.043 --> 31:30.269
A donor is a lady who is interested in Jane Austen, a member of the Friends of the Library, but will only buy Austen for me.

31:31.030 --> 31:31.370
That's wonderful.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.072
She won't buy anything else if I ask them.

31:33.727 --> 31:35.530
That encourages you to find Austin, then?

31:35.550 --> 31:36.492
Yes, it does.

31:36.512 --> 31:38.415
It encourages you to build a collection in Austin.

31:38.736 --> 31:39.196
That's true.

31:39.918 --> 31:41.500
Tell me, yes, this is very important.

31:43.043 --> 31:56.406
Can you give me some idea of the kind of debt an institution such as Boston University owes to private collectors, the passion of private collectors, how that feeds into the building of collections at an institution?

31:56.426 --> 31:58.069
Oh, it does.

31:58.089 --> 31:58.249
It does.

31:59.663 --> 32:05.789
I have another donor who is interested in private press books.

32:06.891 --> 32:17.001
And bit by bit, she has been completing our holdings of the Nonesuch Press, the Allen Press, or the major private presses.

32:17.502 --> 32:18.343
But it's a passion.

32:18.763 --> 32:25.010
She will call every week and she'll say, has anything appeared in the catalogs this week from Nonesuch?

32:25.510 --> 32:28.033
Because we only lack two, and we'll be totally complete.

32:28.199 --> 32:30.261
She knows that?

32:30.521 --> 32:31.162
She knows that.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.564
Does she look on it, do you think, as her collection, please?

32:33.584 --> 32:34.165
Yes, indeed.

32:34.205 --> 32:35.025
It bears her name.

32:35.526 --> 32:37.087
So what is it, then?

32:37.107 --> 32:37.628
Can you tell me?

32:37.928 --> 32:38.188
Yes.

32:38.248 --> 32:47.797
The idea that I have set myself a parameter, and I have completed the task that I said I would.

32:47.878 --> 32:51.941
In other words, this is something she wished to do.

32:52.422 --> 32:52.902
Can I use her name?

32:52.942 --> 32:57.987
Now she's been making sounds to me that she wishes to do the same thing for us on Max Baerbaum.

32:58.625 --> 33:07.978
We have a nice Max Beerbum, but it's not complete by any means, but she now wants us to go into manuscripts as well as printed materials, and she is willing to subsidize that.

33:09.460 --> 33:16.290
If it's a collection that bears her name, is there somebody you can tell me who she is, or would you rather not?

33:16.470 --> 33:17.471
It's Sylvia Burek.

33:18.052 --> 33:18.613
You've met her.

33:18.633 --> 33:19.394
I've met her here.

33:19.835 --> 33:20.676
She's a lovely woman.

33:20.716 --> 33:27.265
A woman of great means, great intelligence, great warmth and heart, who has been

33:27.464 --> 33:29.866
a wonderful support to me in my activities.

33:29.886 --> 33:30.907
Does she collect herself?

33:32.109 --> 33:32.169
No.

33:32.189 --> 33:32.869
But she collects.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.511
You're kind of a story for her.

33:34.551 --> 33:34.631
Yes.

33:35.572 --> 33:36.493
Isn't that interesting?

33:37.634 --> 33:39.216
I have Sylvia's card.

33:39.556 --> 33:40.617
Do you mind if I call her?

33:40.737 --> 33:41.098
Not at all.

33:41.118 --> 33:41.839
To talk about this?

33:42.659 --> 33:47.504
She's very modest, you know, and she may hem in horror and say, oh, I'm not doing anything and all this and that.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.146
She's one of my main props.

33:49.867 --> 33:52.670
Isn't that wonderful?

33:52.690 --> 33:53.731
We mentioned Betty Davis.

33:53.751 --> 33:55.092
Can you name another really

33:55.207 --> 33:59.212
And you said it took eight years of begging, however many years that was.

33:59.232 --> 34:08.042
Can you give me another example of a famous collection that took that kind of gentle and not-so-gentle persuasion to wrest from the individual?

34:08.082 --> 34:21.899
I'm looking for examples that might... I'm trying to... Oh, I could tell you many that got away after all the begging, but... Well, probably a couple.

34:21.919 --> 34:23.060
We know Swanson, of course.

34:24.422 --> 34:24.522
Yeah.

34:26.611 --> 34:55.504
the second one i'm thinking of um hasn't been designated at another institution so i'd rather not say that i don't want to give that person any ideas of uh he hasn't decided where to place his collection yet he's told me it will not come to us it won't come to us i can see his point he has put together a fantastic archive and library relating to russia and china because that's where he spent most of his years of

34:55.940 --> 34:58.204
active reporting from both those areas.

34:58.825 --> 35:07.359
And he felt that this institution does not specialize in those two areas of study, and he would perhaps prefer to be in one of the other.

35:07.379 --> 35:10.163
It's important for you to follow the curriculum then, isn't it?

35:10.283 --> 35:11.626
Yes, which we do.

35:11.866 --> 35:12.747
You said that to me before.

35:12.767 --> 35:13.829
Yes, yes.

35:13.849 --> 35:17.475
And I do not necessarily find that dictum elsewhere.

35:18.113 --> 35:22.637
I ask, you know, at the University of Chicago, they'll take a good collection if it's a good collection.

35:22.657 --> 35:23.758
Some people would take anything.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.561
Some people would take divided collections, which I would never do.

35:26.621 --> 35:30.365
If a north calls me and says, you are interested in my papers, I say yes, yes.

35:30.385 --> 35:37.491
Well, I have everything from 1960 up to the present, but everything from 1930 to 1960 is in Syracuse.

35:38.132 --> 35:40.875
I'd say, well, give the rest to Syracuse.

35:41.035 --> 35:42.236
It should not be divided.

35:42.396 --> 35:43.557
It's unfair to you, it's unfair to that.

35:43.577 --> 35:46.500
Yes, but some institutions will take anything.

35:47.408 --> 35:48.890
just for the sake of possession.

35:49.631 --> 35:55.640
Somebody told me that Syracuse is an interesting story of a mandate to collect that kind of went sour.

35:55.660 --> 35:59.045
Yeah, I think they're out of the collecting business now, as far as I know.

35:59.065 --> 35:59.586
What happened?

35:59.666 --> 36:00.968
Did there some bad decisions, you think?

36:00.988 --> 36:10.222
I think bad decisions, lack of support from the administration, and an attempt to divest themselves, I think, of some of their collections.

36:10.382 --> 36:10.883
I don't know.

36:11.223 --> 36:12.004
Really?

36:12.024 --> 36:12.845
You mean to sell them?

36:12.986 --> 36:13.807
I have no idea.

36:13.927 --> 36:15.289
I don't know.

36:15.573 --> 36:19.378
What would be a fruitful area for me to explore in that?

36:24.324 --> 36:29.971
I think dealers like Rendell could tell you about Syracuse, perhaps.

36:30.011 --> 36:31.653
I've heard about that out in Chicago.

36:31.673 --> 36:38.641
Or their previous curator, who has now gone on to become head of the Beche collection in Philadelphia.

36:40.724 --> 36:44.989
Howard Applegate, used to be head of the American Society of Archivists,

36:47.112 --> 36:52.418
And he's now director of the Beche Collection in Philadelphia.

36:52.458 --> 36:54.380
He used to be the curator in Syracuse.

36:54.520 --> 36:56.041
What is the Beche Collection?

36:56.061 --> 36:58.023
I think it's business papers, primarily.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.985
At the university, probably, right?

37:00.005 --> 37:00.786
At U-Pen, maybe?

37:00.826 --> 37:01.046
No?

37:01.507 --> 37:01.767
No.

37:01.787 --> 37:02.568
It's independent.

37:06.452 --> 37:06.552
Oh.

37:06.572 --> 37:07.854
Okay.

37:07.874 --> 37:11.597
Now, let me know when I've overextended my welcome, by the way.

37:11.718 --> 37:12.418
Another ten minutes?

37:12.578 --> 37:12.939
Okay.

37:13.159 --> 37:13.319
Sure.

37:13.339 --> 37:14.240
Because I know you're a busy man.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.022
We can always get together again at home.

37:16.373 --> 37:17.234
I would hope so.

37:17.555 --> 37:17.795
Yeah.

37:21.161 --> 37:24.988
Well, oh, you were going to tell me how to get in touch with a few people.

37:26.270 --> 37:27.252
Herman Liebert I can get.

37:27.272 --> 37:28.173
He's in New Haven.

37:28.214 --> 37:29.396
Yeah, University.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.927
Do you have the Golia Club list, membership list?

37:35.947 --> 37:38.391
No.

37:38.411 --> 37:40.575
I can give you the address from that.

37:45.095 --> 37:45.896
I love that.

37:45.916 --> 37:50.463
They're really well known for our manuscript collection here.

37:50.844 --> 37:52.065
Are they housed in the same areas?

37:52.927 --> 37:54.229
Book Vault is to your left.

37:54.309 --> 37:55.831
That's where Kathy will take you through.

37:55.891 --> 37:57.293
It's not housed in the same area.

37:57.554 --> 37:59.556
Could I just kind of see where the manuscripts are?

38:00.137 --> 38:03.703
Or would you rather we do that in a different... Certainly.

38:03.883 --> 38:04.263
Certainly.

38:04.304 --> 38:08.109
I'll have Kathy do that as well.

38:08.129 --> 38:08.550
Let's see.

38:08.570 --> 38:09.972
Liebert.

38:09.992 --> 38:11.054
No, I didn't even think of that.

38:12.015 --> 38:13.397
I have gone through everything.

38:13.951 --> 38:16.755
One of the big kicks for me is to go into a train station.

38:16.775 --> 38:22.044
282 York Street, Suite 4.

38:23.386 --> 38:24.147
That's his office.

38:24.207 --> 38:26.671
New Haven, Connecticut, 06511.

38:26.771 --> 38:27.292
Good.

38:32.380 --> 38:37.849
This is a later edition, unless his address has changed.

38:41.643 --> 38:45.070
Tell me again, why do you use it?

38:45.090 --> 38:46.593
Why is it significant for you?

38:46.874 --> 38:48.357
Because I've clung and I've hoped.

38:51.744 --> 38:54.028
Okay, clung and hope from 20.

38:54.349 --> 38:55.010
Cling and hope.

38:55.571 --> 38:56.133
Cling, right?

38:56.453 --> 38:57.996
Yeah, two cling and two hope.

39:00.421 --> 39:00.622
Gotcha.

39:00.642 --> 39:00.782
Gotcha.
