WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.010
And we're going.

00:06.030 --> 00:07.412
I would like to see number one.

00:07.512 --> 00:09.575
Andrea.

00:09.756 --> 00:10.176
Andrea.

00:11.699 --> 00:12.840
Okay.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.042
On July 24th.

00:14.443 --> 00:14.944
July 24th.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.487
In situ.

00:17.507 --> 00:18.329
Yes, in situ.

00:18.689 --> 00:20.853
I cleaned up my office just for you.

00:20.873 --> 00:24.057
Don't open the doors.

00:24.839 --> 00:26.962
And look, this is stuff just arriving.

00:27.062 --> 00:30.427
No, these are all things I'm working on for the catalog project.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.991
The pamphlets, the archive boxes have

00:35.030 --> 00:38.794
pamphlets published in a variety of languages during the 20th century.

00:38.814 --> 00:48.986
I'm going through adding notes that will appear in the printed volume.

00:49.546 --> 00:51.709
The index, however, is going to come at the end.

00:51.769 --> 01:03.602
The other thing I'm adding is what librarians like to call subject access points, subject heading, in the pre-machine terminology.

01:05.371 --> 01:08.855
we'll have at least the backbone of the index.

01:10.017 --> 01:15.283
That'll be started, although that won't actually appear at the end of the volume.

01:16.725 --> 01:17.826
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

01:17.846 --> 01:19.649
Have you worked with children's books before?

01:19.849 --> 01:22.532
Yes.

01:23.393 --> 01:29.601
I started working for Lloyd when I was about three and a half years in my Ph.D.

01:29.621 --> 01:30.602
at UCLA.

01:30.920 --> 01:58.092
My teaching assistantship was just about to run out, and I got a letter in November from Neutrogena Corporation, and I said, huh, I knew who was at Neutrogena Corporation, because when I left the Morgan Library to go do my PhD at UCLA, I told Justin Schiller, ah, you know, that book collector, Tilda's book collector in Beverly Hills, Cox's, yeah, and I said,

01:58.443 --> 02:01.126
If he ever wants a librarian or somebody to catalog his book.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.507
He said this to gentlemen.

02:02.527 --> 02:03.068
That's so funny.

02:03.408 --> 02:06.671
I said, so you just let him know I'm out there, okay?

02:06.691 --> 02:07.372
So nothing happens.

02:07.392 --> 02:08.493
This letter comes.

02:08.513 --> 02:10.054
And it's a perfect Lloyd letter.

02:10.415 --> 02:11.256
I have it somewhere.

02:12.417 --> 02:13.678
I'm probably misquoting it.

02:14.098 --> 02:16.561
The text is probably better now in my memory than it was.

02:16.661 --> 02:25.069
But the gist of it was, I've been trying to reach you by telephone at home, but you're never there.

02:26.150 --> 02:27.792
Please call my...

02:28.143 --> 02:34.633
assistant to set up an appointment to talk about a job, sincerely.

02:34.693 --> 02:35.214
And this is when?

02:35.234 --> 02:35.554
What year?

02:35.674 --> 02:38.759
Oh, this is November 84, 85.

02:38.819 --> 02:40.141
I can double check.

02:40.582 --> 02:42.425
I've been with Lloyd for a long time.

02:42.445 --> 02:42.605
Wow.

02:42.925 --> 02:45.610
So I made an appointment because he's busy.

02:45.630 --> 02:48.234
It was in the beginning of January.

02:49.355 --> 02:57.087
So I went down and was ushered back to the executive suite where his

02:57.370 --> 03:02.916
Immaculate Assistant Sonia was sitting, and I walked in and she looked at me.

03:03.637 --> 03:04.558
She said, he's not here.

03:06.159 --> 03:06.920
Did she know who you were?

03:07.481 --> 03:08.121
Yeah, she knew who I was.

03:08.141 --> 03:08.742
She asked him.

03:09.062 --> 03:09.543
He's not here.

03:10.544 --> 03:13.747
I said, oh, well, I've had this appointment for a while.

03:13.947 --> 03:14.728
Well, he's in Europe.

03:14.848 --> 03:17.431
He won't be back for another six weeks.

03:17.451 --> 03:18.833
I said, all right.

03:18.953 --> 03:22.697
It would be nice of somebody to call me.

03:22.717 --> 03:25.960
If you'd met Sonia, you would understand.

03:26.463 --> 03:31.689
I said, well, all right, I started to turn around, and she said, somebody said, well, where are you going?

03:31.789 --> 03:37.917
And I said, well, uh, and she said, the books are in there, and pointed, and pointed to the room.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.843
Well, I said, uh, well, what am I supposed to do?

03:42.903 --> 03:45.006
And she looked at me, and she said, you're the librarian.

03:46.668 --> 03:47.729
I said, all right.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.172
Yeah, so, who knows?

03:50.532 --> 03:51.574
So, well, I didn't know that.

03:51.674 --> 03:55.238
I thought it was kind of strange to be told to work on some of these books.

03:55.741 --> 03:59.627
I said, well, all right, I'll go in this morning and see what there is.

03:59.808 --> 04:06.318
And essentially what the office was maybe about, it was larger than this.

04:06.699 --> 04:08.101
So he kept the books at Neutrogena.

04:08.342 --> 04:09.604
Well, he didn't have a condo.

04:09.644 --> 04:17.497
Well, at that point he had them in various storage facilities in Neutrogena.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.420
Most of them were living in...

04:19.805 --> 04:29.653
an old airplane hanger, which was reputed to be one of Howard Hughes's, where it was the product warehouse, and it was in the back, and on pallet, shrink wrap.

04:29.774 --> 04:34.918
And that had all been moved out of the house in Beverly Hills, and they'd been sitting there for years at that point.

04:35.018 --> 04:48.850
Now, what was in the office she showed me into were the last three or four years' worth of acquisitions in boxes, without the invoices, everything piled up, shoved in drawers, and I just started unpacking things.

04:49.117 --> 04:52.041
Did he have a vision of what he was doing at this point?

04:53.283 --> 04:55.806
I mean, when you buy books, usually you handle them a little bit.

04:55.826 --> 04:56.747
You take a look at them.

04:57.108 --> 04:58.169
Well, he can.

04:58.209 --> 05:01.374
He's the kind of collector who's more interested in the chase, I think.

05:01.394 --> 05:01.714
The chase?

05:01.734 --> 05:03.597
And the chase more interested in the chase.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.100
Handling the goods.

05:06.581 --> 05:07.062
Yeah.

05:07.082 --> 05:09.084
He doesn't necessarily go back and look at them.

05:09.104 --> 05:13.150
Well, I should say, if he goes back and looks at them, he does it.

05:13.467 --> 05:17.752
He does it when either Ivy isn't around or he did it when I wasn't around.

05:17.852 --> 05:20.796
I can't say for sure that he didn't do it.

05:20.836 --> 05:23.800
Do you think at this point he had a sense of mission?

05:24.180 --> 05:25.602
He clearly has a sense of mission here.

05:25.622 --> 05:43.103
I've discussed this with him in as gentle a way as I can, but we have touched on some of the horrible tragedy that... Well, that's why all the books were on the pallets shrink-wrapped, because they were moved out of the house and put there.

05:43.927 --> 06:01.873
I mean, there were, you know, there were boxes of things that clearly were just, just stuff was thrown in and sealed, and that was it, because someone, whoever it was, either couldn't bear to throw it away or whatever, and every once in a while, you know, you run into one of these boxes, and it's painful.

06:01.893 --> 06:10.225
Well, when I was out there, and he was showing me through, and my first impressions are big for me.

06:11.227 --> 06:12.769
It's almost even how I start writing that.

06:13.762 --> 06:21.069
And at this point, I didn't know that the boy's name was Noah.

06:22.230 --> 06:24.432
Sometimes ingenuous questions are pretty good questions.

06:24.532 --> 06:26.894
I said, wow, these Noah's Arks.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.378
And he said, I had a son named Noah.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.920
Nice play, Nick.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.001
I walked right into it.

06:34.021 --> 06:37.724
But nevertheless, you know, and then, well, I don't know.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.346
He can talk about it to some extent.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.867
Yeah, and then I came back the next day.

06:40.887 --> 06:42.509
It was good that it was a two-day interview.

06:42.529 --> 06:43.650
And they went back to my hotel.

06:44.002 --> 06:56.414
He told me where to go, the Renaissance Hotel, we'll go there, and listen to my tape, and then he went back there since I was really able to get, and he couldn't ask me anything, you know, and he was ready for it, I think.

06:56.434 --> 07:11.950
But my point is, walking through beyond the Noah's Acts, which impressed me even more, were these little handwritten pieces of, like notebook paper, line paper, four pieces of paper, and each one had a name on it, and it was the surviving children of his.

07:12.233 --> 07:12.854
Oh, right.

07:12.874 --> 07:13.154
Yeah, yeah.

07:13.214 --> 07:18.060
And it was books that were given to them while Joanne was alive.

07:18.120 --> 07:18.861
Right.

07:18.881 --> 07:22.886
And that last chance before these things go to Princeton, books that mean something to you.

07:22.906 --> 07:27.853
And then I asked them, I said, everything else was perfect and precise, and yet this was kind of casual.

07:28.413 --> 07:34.081
Well, actually, not all of those books were sorted out.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.884
Some of the family books are still here.

07:37.605 --> 07:40.789
But no, just the fact that he was doing this.

07:41.596 --> 07:43.818
story touching, you know?

07:43.838 --> 07:43.898
No.

07:43.938 --> 07:46.741
Have you talked about it?

07:46.761 --> 07:59.234
Actually, that's one of the other things I'm doing as I'm going through the books is making sure that we don't lose track of the books that were originally part of the family library that often have Joanne's notes to the children.

07:59.254 --> 08:10.725
I was just the other day, I was a whole set of little French pamphlets, obviously

08:11.093 --> 08:24.949
they've been bought to help the girls with their French, and Joanne, one of them, it's called La Fête de la Petite Sirene, so it's The Party is a Little Mermaid, and so Joanne had written Dear Toby and Happy Birthday.

08:26.811 --> 08:31.036
How do you think it compares with Anderson?

08:31.457 --> 08:32.738
It's hard to think.

08:32.758 --> 08:34.060
It really is.

08:34.080 --> 08:34.941
Yeah, it is.

08:34.961 --> 08:39.666
I've written a lot of stories in my life, you know, you can't get callous to something like this, it's just...

08:40.118 --> 08:43.421
Well, it's something he goes with every day, and I'm sure everyone's told you that.

08:43.601 --> 08:46.604
He very rarely says anything about it.

08:46.624 --> 08:51.809
No, I hate to transcribe myself.

08:51.929 --> 09:08.725
I think the negotiations started while I was in England in 1990-1992, and UCLA had been working on him at that point since the late 80s.

09:09.565 --> 09:11.027
They wanted it very badly.

09:11.908 --> 09:13.609
Michael and Murphy wanted it very badly.

09:13.649 --> 09:15.271
And they still wanted it very badly.

09:16.673 --> 09:16.933
Well.

09:17.233 --> 09:21.538
But he told me, you know, I don't know if this is the way coach of Western.

09:21.598 --> 09:23.600
I've only been at most, you know, these two times.

09:23.660 --> 09:29.367
But he said if Princeton doesn't, it's almost like a Samuel Pepys thing, right?

09:29.547 --> 09:35.353
If Princeton doesn't do X things an X amount of time.

09:35.857 --> 09:37.899
I don't know how serious he is about that.

09:37.919 --> 09:41.603
But I would never start with a guy like him.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.666
I mean, he's probably capable of doing that.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.388
Yeah, he's a wild man.

09:45.468 --> 09:46.569
No doubt about it.

09:46.829 --> 09:48.331
I won't quote you on that.

09:48.671 --> 09:52.215
No, I'd say it to his face.

09:53.136 --> 09:55.399
I know he said that's how he said things out.

09:56.140 --> 10:03.568
I know at one point he said he was... Again, I don't know if this has changed, but if...

10:04.460 --> 10:07.304
For some reason, the collection was going to be sold at auction.

10:07.324 --> 10:13.453
I was supposed to be one of the executors to see it through the auction.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.517
He foresees the possibility of this being sold at auction?

10:16.537 --> 10:20.503
This is something he talked about maybe four years ago, five years ago.

10:20.523 --> 10:25.531
I mean, I suppose it's just a good businessman not hedging his bets.

10:25.991 --> 10:31.099
It's just, I suppose, taking care of, foreseeing every eventual.

10:31.319 --> 10:34.163
I have no idea if he did it or not, but he asked me.

10:34.598 --> 10:41.024
Justin and me, and I think that was the plan.

10:41.044 --> 10:43.827
I don't know if he did it.

10:44.107 --> 10:53.156
But you certainly must come to work every day with the knowledge that this man has an outline of all things.

10:53.577 --> 10:57.360
He wants things to be done in the grand scheme.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.982
He wants things done in the grand scheme.

10:59.322 --> 11:03.306
So right now we're... And there's a big picture.

11:03.421 --> 11:04.903
Yeah, there's a big picture.

11:04.943 --> 11:09.329
How clear it is in his mind, I don't know to tell you the truth.

11:09.349 --> 11:12.933
And we have this extraordinary library, and it is a library, not a collection.

11:12.953 --> 11:14.595
I think we should probably make that point.

11:14.615 --> 11:15.797
Would you agree with that?

11:16.377 --> 11:18.440
Yeah, it's a library.

11:20.483 --> 11:22.625
If I'm repeating material, he's already told you.

11:23.767 --> 11:31.757
On the one hand, he wants the books themselves to evolve into an international research center for children.

11:33.138 --> 12:03.111
I don't know to what extent he envisions it also being a resource for historians, which I think, given the climate right now, it's probably cultural and social historians who are most likely, in some ways, to make use of the books more than people in literature, at least until the maniac or theory passes.

12:03.513 --> 12:08.437
of interest in literary history reemergence, if it does.

12:08.678 --> 12:11.961
Of course, he doesn't have a scholar's temperament at all.

12:13.202 --> 12:18.406
I suppose that's why he has me, because I'm the scholar on the team, I guess.

12:18.426 --> 12:21.629
A scholar on the team being strategic.

12:21.649 --> 12:22.971
You have a PhD, what, in Library of Science?

12:22.991 --> 12:23.811
No, no, no, no, no.

12:23.831 --> 12:26.093
I'm a PhD in 18th century English literature.

12:26.113 --> 12:26.534
Oh, wow.

12:26.554 --> 12:27.034
Oh, that's wonderful.

12:27.094 --> 12:30.417
That's because I specialize in the 18th century children's books.

12:30.437 --> 12:30.637
I see.

12:30.657 --> 12:33.520
I'm particularly interested in them, because it's got

12:35.930 --> 12:49.251
Because the children's book in the form we conceive of is one of the whole products of, if you want to think of it as early consumer capitalism.

12:50.092 --> 12:50.713
You're a scholar.

12:51.074 --> 12:51.555
I'm a scholar.

12:51.975 --> 12:53.137
Are you a librarian as well?

12:53.277 --> 12:55.280
I am a librarian as well.

12:55.301 --> 12:56.162
By training?

12:56.222 --> 13:02.612
By training and by background, I've worked at the, well, of course, I've worked at

13:03.014 --> 13:06.299
special collections at UCLA while I was doing my Ph.D.

13:06.359 --> 13:08.862
I curated some exhibitions.

13:09.263 --> 13:11.666
I was in and out doing various kinds of chores.

13:11.767 --> 13:21.601
I compiled an index of the first review journal devoted to children's books as an occasional publication for special collections.

13:22.262 --> 13:23.904
I've also worked at the Morning Library.

13:24.124 --> 13:29.612
When I'm still in the Department of Early Children's Books, I was a consultant to the

13:29.930 --> 13:38.042
Opie Collection of Bodleian, and my principal role there was to help them with the big microfilming project.

13:38.082 --> 13:40.085
So you really didn't have the interview for this job.

13:40.105 --> 13:42.869
You just had to agree whether or not to take it.

13:42.889 --> 13:47.436
I mean, he certainly must have... Well, no, he didn't... He must have been in a short list of one, would be my idea.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.158
Well, he actually didn't insist.

13:49.178 --> 13:55.047
It was actually Princeton's idea, actually, to approach me.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.413
I, frankly, didn't expect to be asked.

13:59.832 --> 14:16.333
I didn't know very much about, I didn't really know very much about the whole climate at Princeton, and I assumed that from the institution's point of view it would be a drawback to have the private librarian come because... Well, sure, there's conflict.

14:16.693 --> 14:18.015
It's unavoidable.

14:18.035 --> 14:19.797
It's unavoidable.

14:20.438 --> 14:25.464
The other reason I thought they wouldn't ask is because they knew it would have to be a package deal.

14:25.544 --> 14:29.569
They'd have to come up with something for my husband as well.

14:29.735 --> 14:33.699
My husband and I are the first spousal appointments in Princeton University.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.082
He's the curator of graphic arts.

14:36.142 --> 14:40.768
Bill told me, by the way, that I built Joyce, and I should probably want to talk to him.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.931
I hope to have a chapter vaguely considered right now.

14:43.951 --> 14:47.255
It's the only one I really haven't researched yet on the book arts.

14:47.755 --> 14:49.738
You've got to talk to Andrea's.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.438
Yeah, you should talk.

14:50.479 --> 14:55.164
The next trip down, because I'm going to come down to see John McPhee.

14:55.184 --> 14:57.987
That'll be soon, so I'll be in touch.

14:58.844 --> 15:02.188
Yeah, so I more or less just wrote it off.

15:02.288 --> 15:04.932
I said, well, it's going to be somebody else's baby.

15:05.572 --> 15:18.569
And so I was quite surprised when Bill Joyce called and then said... How many people have that kind of influence?

15:18.909 --> 15:19.990
Well, but he didn't ask.

15:20.010 --> 15:21.733
He never asked.

15:22.293 --> 15:24.276
He never suggested that they offer John to me.

15:25.037 --> 15:25.257
Ever.

15:25.523 --> 15:27.245
That was all Princeton's initiative.

15:27.445 --> 15:28.627
At least that's what they tell me.

15:28.647 --> 15:31.370
Well, let's put it in another context.

15:31.410 --> 15:33.553
This is how important Lloyd Coateson is to them, I guess.

15:33.613 --> 15:33.914
Oh, yes.

15:34.374 --> 15:39.321
There's no doubt about it.

15:39.341 --> 15:41.664
And maybe this should be off the record to tell you the truth.

15:41.724 --> 15:43.286
You want something off the record.

15:43.306 --> 15:44.808
You don't have to put it off.

15:45.028 --> 15:45.729
Just so stated.

15:45.909 --> 15:46.910
I'll listen to it.

15:46.950 --> 15:48.973
I go over quotes to people, by the way.

15:49.353 --> 15:49.894
No, that's fine.

15:50.110 --> 16:01.502
To be perfectly honest, it was very difficult to decide to take the job when they offered it, because I knew how important donor Lloyd was to the university.

16:03.204 --> 16:10.731
I also knew that Princeton did not really have programs that would naturally gravitate to the collection.

16:10.771 --> 16:14.055
This wasn't supporting the curriculum.

16:14.155 --> 16:15.156
No, no.

16:16.469 --> 16:24.418
There are some faculty members who are actively opposed to the collection coming here because children's books are not befitting.

16:25.419 --> 16:37.352
And I mean, I would be, frankly, between, I'd be torn between the Downer University Library and the University of Administration.

16:37.372 --> 16:44.400
And frankly, I mean, there are plenty of times I still don't know if I'm up to it because I'm not really a political animal.

16:45.578 --> 16:47.442
I'm a scholar, for better or worse.

16:47.843 --> 16:59.489
I guess I'm an old-fashioned enough kind of curator to believe that part of your mission, in a way, is to take care of your books, like your family, in a way.

17:00.752 --> 17:03.418
That's part of your cultural role.

17:04.850 --> 17:09.096
Well, but it's not a view that's much in fashion among library professionals.

17:09.136 --> 17:12.241
That's a very 19th century view of librarianship.

17:12.341 --> 17:23.577
And if you are supposed to think of yourself as an information specialist or broker, I don't think the two are necessarily incompatible, but that's just the way things have gone.

17:25.580 --> 17:31.228
Because in a way, the kinds of things you learn about

17:31.782 --> 17:35.788
When you work with a large, important collection over the years, they come in.

17:35.828 --> 17:49.128
It's not so much that you go out looking for connections between books, but they come on you, and then you pass that on and turn to other people who can use it, or you use it in your own work.

17:49.168 --> 17:58.802
However, you accumulate a tremendous amount of, well, often it's just ideas.

17:58.934 --> 18:00.216
Why do the books matter?

18:00.256 --> 18:02.058
Why should anybody pay attention to them?

18:02.078 --> 18:03.900
You know, children don't read them anymore.

18:03.940 --> 18:07.745
And there are people mostly in the field of children's literature.

18:07.765 --> 18:15.615
There's a very well-known, rather controversial scholar, Peter Hunt, who essentially says, history are books that children don't read anymore.

18:15.655 --> 18:16.156
Who cares?

18:16.236 --> 18:18.699
The history of children's books is essentially irrelevant.

18:18.719 --> 18:20.461
Oh, all over the place.

18:20.882 --> 18:21.903
Peter Hunt.

18:22.204 --> 18:22.704
Let's see.

18:22.724 --> 18:24.727
I'll do a search.

18:24.787 --> 18:28.051
He teaches in, he writes in Gloucestershire.

18:28.071 --> 18:28.772
He teaches it.

18:29.073 --> 18:30.295
University of Wales.

18:32.197 --> 18:35.902
He says these are really worthless?

18:35.942 --> 18:38.065
Well, he just says it's not relevant.

18:38.085 --> 18:38.826
It doesn't matter.

18:38.947 --> 18:41.590
What really matters is what children are reading now.

18:44.935 --> 18:47.138
Certainly, Darwin would love to get a hold of this.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.324
This is a man who's totally dismissing books as a historical object.

18:51.344 --> 18:52.906
Yeah, essentially, yeah.

18:53.126 --> 18:56.851
Well, Peter Hunt and Brian Alderson, I don't know if that's another name you're familiar with.

18:56.911 --> 18:58.894
Brian Alderson is...

19:01.591 --> 19:06.837
I was very much interested in the history of children's books, and he and Peter just go at it hammering tongs.

19:06.857 --> 19:09.881
As a matter of fact, I can dig it up for you now.

19:09.941 --> 19:16.229
They had an exchange in children's book history newsletter.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.774
Sometimes it's hard to tell how serious Peter Hunt is.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.117
I'm beginning to think now he is genuinely serious.

19:23.177 --> 19:24.278
It's not just polemic.

19:24.339 --> 19:25.600
Young man, middle-aged man?

19:26.521 --> 19:28.864
Oh, I suppose he must be...

19:30.110 --> 19:32.113
I suppose he might be in his early 50s.

19:32.354 --> 19:35.619
He's one of those kinds of Englishmen that's kind of hard to tell how old he really is.

19:35.639 --> 19:39.346
I'm just wondering where he's coming at, or how he's coming at.

19:39.366 --> 19:40.307
Well, he's quite clear.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.371
I mean, he doesn't beat about the bush.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.354
He says why he says that.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.379
Well, what does he suggest as an alternative?

19:47.399 --> 19:49.282
Is this not worth preserving?

19:49.302 --> 19:52.708
Well, he says they're relics.

19:52.908 --> 19:55.152
They're not a part of children's life.

19:55.172 --> 19:57.597
They're gathered by collectors of museums or something.

19:57.677 --> 19:59.621
Yeah, exactly, because they're dead books, I think.

19:59.641 --> 20:08.357
I don't know that he uses that phrase, but that's the upshot of what he says, these books are dead.

20:08.518 --> 20:11.423
I'm dealing with dead books, living books.

20:11.723 --> 20:14.365
Harvard maintains there's no such thing as a dead book.

20:14.385 --> 20:16.367
Yes, that sounds like Roger.

20:16.768 --> 20:23.033
And I've been out to the Depository and really doing the Harvard Depository and how they shelve them, how they barcode them.

20:23.093 --> 20:23.874
Very interesting.

20:23.974 --> 20:26.637
How Ken Carpenter decides what books to send out there.

20:26.677 --> 20:31.061
I went with him on one of his little trips and we selected a couple hundred books.

20:31.201 --> 20:38.828
And I even, God forbid, I selected, you know, I can have this book based on the criteria that you've outlined, you know, to duplicate a copy of a book.

20:39.584 --> 20:40.846
of a book that nobody reads.

20:40.886 --> 20:41.887
It's an old novel.

20:41.968 --> 20:42.689
Yep, that's going.

20:43.089 --> 20:44.992
Let's make sure it doesn't have another introduction.

20:45.012 --> 20:54.767
Let's see if there isn't a textual, physical quality that argues... Right, a special finding that someone wrote in it.

20:54.927 --> 21:00.495
And he suggested that I read Genet's book on paratexts, which is very interesting, and it's going to apply it.

21:00.515 --> 21:02.458
I got that from Cambridge.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.243
I'm not sure I go again, but I'm very interested in this stuff.

21:05.263 --> 21:08.848
And to suggest that books are dead is... Well, I think...

21:09.217 --> 21:16.406
This is actually a long-time split in children's book studies.

21:16.866 --> 21:22.814
People in children's literature often tend to be interested in normative judgments.

21:22.894 --> 21:25.717
They're interested in, will a child like it?

21:25.818 --> 21:26.919
Why does a child like it?

21:26.959 --> 21:29.402
What do they get out of it?

21:31.205 --> 21:37.032
Even if they're teaching children's literature in the university, often those are the kinds of things they're often interested in.

21:37.052 --> 21:41.398
Not always, but that makes sense because, of course, a lot of them are teaching elementary school teachers.

21:41.418 --> 21:43.000
They're teaching school librarians.

21:43.040 --> 21:50.149
They're teaching sometimes parents who are coming back to take extension courses, and they want to know more about what they can give their kids to read.

21:50.750 --> 21:58.680
That's a valid enterprise, and it needs to be done because one of the jobs is hooking adults

21:59.268 --> 22:03.532
up with books to share with children or suggest that children read.

22:03.773 --> 22:12.141
Of course, there are those that say that that's an adultist view, that only choices children make on their own count.

22:12.262 --> 22:15.485
Those are the only real books that children like, all the other stuff.

22:15.525 --> 22:17.347
You don't get into that at all here, do you?

22:17.367 --> 22:20.270
Oh, no, sure, no, sure, because that's a longstanding debate.

22:20.891 --> 22:27.958
To what extent do you let children pick what they read and what, on the other hand, do you expose them to because you think

22:28.310 --> 22:33.837
Maybe they're ready to think about a particular subject.

22:33.917 --> 22:34.758
It's maybe death.

22:35.419 --> 22:45.853
You know, it can be any of those eternal subjects that children eventually have to start wrapping their minds around whether they want to or not.

22:45.873 --> 22:47.875
Just for the record, when did you and your husband come here?

22:47.895 --> 22:48.877
95.

22:48.897 --> 22:50.879
Oh, very recently.

22:50.899 --> 22:51.400
Yeah.

22:51.420 --> 22:56.967
But what I was going to say, I was trying to get... No, I was trying to get back to the whole...

22:57.132 --> 22:58.354
live dead book issue.

22:58.875 --> 23:11.112
I think the problem is, this is something I'd like to write on myself one day, is that, you know, books have shelf lives in terms of how many generations are they read.

23:12.274 --> 23:19.525
And why children, when children's books start being read, they suddenly become a lot better than an adult novel than it is read.

23:19.585 --> 23:24.692
And I think it's partly just because, I suppose more so than for adults,

23:25.752 --> 23:42.472
If you give children anything that's more or less realistic, once the conditions of the lives described become significantly different from the lives that kids now lead, the book doesn't make a lot of sense.

23:42.492 --> 23:43.353
They don't connect.

23:43.413 --> 23:49.340
Did you see the piece in the New York Times a few weeks ago about the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, 70 years?

23:49.460 --> 23:50.121
Why is it?

23:50.401 --> 23:51.683
But they've been rewritten four times.

23:51.703 --> 23:52.263
That's the point.

23:52.324 --> 23:53.225
That's what you're saying.

23:53.245 --> 23:54.426
They're adapting.

23:54.811 --> 24:23.704
you know savvy uh yeah the road the roadster's got to go but the role of the woman is changing uh the mother i mean all of that right and i think the thing is 200 million copies of these books in print exactly and but the thing is when you get the further you get back children's books the texts are simple they look like they're easy but often in fact they're very difficult often what appears like a very simple text may be

24:24.258 --> 24:28.823
really engaging in all kinds of important issues at the time it was written.

24:29.403 --> 24:32.967
But it's very often very hard to recover them.

24:34.248 --> 24:52.307
And so if someone, if somebody really spends the time, a friend of mine who works on Mariah Edgeworth, who was one of the first great, really realistic writers for children, a really marvelous writer, that the amount of work she's done sometimes to reestablish what the, something like what the story meant at the time it was writing it,

24:52.507 --> 24:58.774
often much more controversial and much more pointed than you would think just to read it.

24:58.834 --> 25:04.920
And all of a sudden, you know, it's as rich as reading a novel from a period where you can see, you know, you're dealing with the whole issue.

25:04.940 --> 25:14.690
You know, all kinds of issues about how to raise children, you know, how do you teach children, how do children perceive, you know, all the big issues, they're there.

25:14.710 --> 25:21.838
But on the other hand, when a children's book becomes a classic, it's there forever.

25:22.122 --> 25:22.482
No?

25:22.583 --> 25:24.345
Yes.

25:24.385 --> 25:25.686
If you look.

25:25.846 --> 25:32.414
Most children's classics that are... If you look at St.

25:32.454 --> 25:36.118
Hallsberg's Polar Express, it's just a very small period of time.

25:36.418 --> 25:37.800
That book's a bestseller every year.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.723
For 15, you know, however many years it's been out.

25:41.204 --> 25:45.208
Okay, but the real test is... Well, Harsindak's been on it.

25:45.228 --> 25:51.015
But I was thinking, if you're thinking of real classics that have gone past one or two generations, all of those...

25:51.181 --> 25:53.324
Mid-Victorian.

25:54.506 --> 25:55.487
No, they're not gone.

25:55.507 --> 26:02.236
In a community like Princeton, of course, kids have Alice read to them.

26:02.256 --> 26:02.817
I don't know.

26:04.099 --> 26:07.724
Outside communities like that, I don't honestly know.

26:08.324 --> 26:10.768
It's interesting, though, if you go out on the web sometimes.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.051
You go surfing on the web to see what's out there.

26:13.071 --> 26:17.577
There are all kinds of web pages and children's books.

26:17.978 --> 26:20.221
I mean, one of the reasons we decided to put C.S.

26:20.301 --> 26:23.625
Lewis in the giant book, and I had... It's called the giant book out there.

26:23.645 --> 26:24.446
It's the giant book.

26:24.466 --> 26:25.307
Whose idea was that?

26:26.249 --> 26:28.451
Oh, the gallery designer, Lynn Bradlin.

26:30.754 --> 26:31.676
Men, L-A-N-N?

26:31.916 --> 26:32.597
L-A-N-N-E.

26:34.079 --> 26:36.001
B-R-E-S, L-A-N-N.

26:36.602 --> 26:37.603
Yeah, but she's Jewish.

26:37.944 --> 26:38.204
I don't know.

26:38.224 --> 26:42.830
I never quite asked her how she got... Where is she from?

26:42.850 --> 26:43.751
She's in Manhattan.

26:45.013 --> 26:46.375
Did Voyage pick her?

26:46.395 --> 26:47.496
Yeah, she was his choice.

26:49.636 --> 26:53.002
So he undoubtedly articulated his loss.

26:53.984 --> 26:59.213
Well, she appealed to him because she seemed the most creative.

26:59.233 --> 27:08.370
I guess he thought she'd come up with something unexpected.

27:10.273 --> 27:14.040
But what I was saying just briefly was,

27:14.543 --> 27:21.974
Everybody on the design team wanted some sort of a fantasy to go in there, but the problem is, of course, most of the best fantasies aren't illustrated.

27:23.296 --> 27:24.899
I hesitated to suggest C.S.

27:24.939 --> 27:27.583
Lewis, probably, because it was a favorite of mine.

27:27.763 --> 27:33.853
Most people would probably tell you I have hopelessly high-brow taste with Mr. Richard.

27:34.413 --> 27:36.977
I did see something about Mary last weekend and laughed myself.

27:37.138 --> 27:38.400
I was so ashamed of myself.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.985
Never mind.

27:42.623 --> 27:44.025
But I wasn't going to suggest it.

27:44.245 --> 27:45.988
And then, for some reason, we just went out.

27:46.429 --> 27:48.332
We weren't crawling on the web to see what was there.

27:48.352 --> 27:50.615
And there are all these homepages on C.S.

27:50.695 --> 28:00.870
Lewis, maintained by all kinds of different people, sometimes by... There are a lot of Christian groups, but there are also various chat rooms that kids run.

28:02.032 --> 28:04.155
Anyways, I said, okay, we'll put them up.

28:04.275 --> 28:09.102
Who uses that giant book?

28:09.122 --> 28:09.663
Who's that for?

28:10.124 --> 28:10.825
That's for kids.

28:11.277 --> 28:21.427
The target age for the exhibit is ages 9 to 12, although we get kids a lot younger, casual visitors.

28:22.948 --> 28:25.110
We get everything from 18-month-olds.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.713
Who brings them?

28:27.733 --> 28:30.055
It's mostly casual visitors at this point.

28:31.096 --> 28:37.101
We're just about to hire a person to design and implement an outreach program.

28:38.663 --> 28:38.803
Really?

28:39.391 --> 28:49.005
I should have looked at my, I didn't have time, but I should have looked at my transcript of my chosen interview before I came here, because he really wants to engage.

28:49.105 --> 28:49.666
Yes, he does.

28:50.427 --> 28:55.475
In a real, meaningful way, and as charming and attractive as these things out here.

28:55.695 --> 28:58.619
I don't know if that's precisely what he has in mind.

28:59.020 --> 29:07.272
Well, I think this is another good case of where, I don't know if Lloyd has a clear idea of what he wants, but he'll know it when he sees it.

29:09.243 --> 29:13.690
It's a big challenge, because... He believes in books for kids.

29:14.051 --> 29:15.072
He believes in books for kids.

29:15.092 --> 29:27.953
And he wants kids to come here and do something with books, or that you will do something for these kids with books, whether or not this is going to work within the big picture.

29:28.914 --> 29:36.726
No, well, it's a big challenge, and, of course, part of the problem is... Princeton does not teach the public schools.

29:36.827 --> 29:37.107
No.

29:37.323 --> 29:43.592
Well, there are all kinds of things at Princeton, but finding out who all these people are when they do is a challenge.

29:44.934 --> 29:52.205
Part of the problem is, of course, when you have rare books, you don't have the advantage a science museum has.

29:52.386 --> 29:55.731
You can design stuff to be touched, punched, hit, whatever.

29:55.771 --> 29:56.692
You've got that out there.

29:57.714 --> 30:06.587
Yes, but you'll notice that it's not necessarily tied in any significant way to the collection itself.

30:08.086 --> 30:10.569
It could just, it could be any, anywhere.

30:11.290 --> 30:20.981
Is it an attempt, you don't have to ask, to placate Lloyd in a way, maybe, to, uh, hoping, perhaps?

30:21.001 --> 30:27.388
Well, there's a, I would, it would be a lie to say there isn't an element of that when he threw... I don't want to embarrass you.

30:27.529 --> 30:29.271
No, no, no, no, no, he, no.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.115
I think if you asked him, he would tell you.

30:33.415 --> 30:40.124
He threw this down as a gauntlet to the university to say, this is a challenge that the university needs to accept.

30:44.850 --> 30:58.748
I think he also knows that I was very ambivalent about the whole concept of having a very high-tech interactive exhibit that was designed to teach and to instill lifelong learning with reading.

30:59.487 --> 31:03.132
Partly just because I think there's a big ends and means question.

31:03.613 --> 31:08.360
And I personally think where it really gets kids involved in reading is often just other people.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.603
Other people who... Parents reading books?

31:10.623 --> 31:17.333
Parents, grandparents, older siblings, teachers, librarians, whatever.

31:17.473 --> 31:21.679
It's the personal contact that matters more.

31:21.699 --> 31:27.688
My favorite photographs of my daughter's... We took a lot of research in Channel Land, isn't it?

31:27.803 --> 31:36.337
I picture them on a train going up to Cambridge, and they were little reading books, other than to move under the Michelangelo statues.

31:36.938 --> 31:41.746
I think, well, there's a time you can stop reading the book and look at the statues.

31:42.087 --> 31:43.209
Oh, they're busy.

31:43.349 --> 31:44.772
They're interesting.

31:44.832 --> 31:50.121
But I mean, that's where the passion for books comes, I think.

31:50.281 --> 31:52.765
It doesn't turn on.

31:53.133 --> 31:55.837
I think that's what you're saying.

31:55.897 --> 31:56.037
Yeah.

31:56.057 --> 31:57.379
I was ambivalent about it.

31:57.439 --> 32:01.285
I took the development of the exhibit very seriously.

32:02.046 --> 32:14.263
It was hard to do because, frankly, the content was curated after the designer gave the presentation instead of being the other way around.

32:14.395 --> 32:16.057
So maybe it's a good start?

32:16.077 --> 32:17.018
It's a good start.

32:17.038 --> 32:21.023
As a matter of fact, I have an idea for the next one, but I'll keep that to myself.

32:21.183 --> 32:24.006
So this is a changing exhibition, perhaps?

32:24.207 --> 32:26.009
It'll be there for at least two years.

32:26.209 --> 32:27.971
How much beyond two years, I'm not sure.

32:27.991 --> 32:30.794
Do you have anything printed on it that will help me?

32:30.814 --> 32:32.076
I can send you stuff.

32:32.096 --> 32:32.296
Okay.

32:32.316 --> 32:33.978
I don't have to take notes on the whole thing.

32:34.098 --> 32:36.802
No, we can send you drawings.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.745
Very interesting.

32:41.007 --> 32:45.632
Let's talk a little bit about, tell me about the library that you have, that you are custodian of.

32:47.935 --> 32:53.781
Is it the library of children's books by which others will be measured, do you think?

32:55.924 --> 32:59.147
Well, of course, all the collections are rather different.

33:01.050 --> 33:08.618
Lloyd's is very different because of the international focus.

33:09.340 --> 33:16.410
Well, the major collections focus on one national tradition and then have... Betsy Shirley, for instance.

33:16.470 --> 33:16.750
Right.

33:17.652 --> 33:19.795
The Ball one out of the early library.

33:19.935 --> 33:24.681
Well, the Ball collection, of course, has some foreign language material.

33:25.322 --> 33:26.504
So pretty focused, though.

33:26.584 --> 33:26.824
Yeah.

33:27.425 --> 33:37.339
But we have 32 different languages represented here, which makes it a nightmare for this catalog project, right?

33:37.522 --> 33:52.763
But I didn't tell you Dan is ABD in Slavic linguistics, and frankly I needed somebody with his kind of experience in languages because of the problem of getting all the diacritics in, which in a machined environment is no joke.

33:54.084 --> 34:07.242
As a matter of fact, these are all the sorts of things you've had to develop because we have Turkish, Latvian, Russian, German, Swedish, Czech,

34:07.610 --> 34:14.918
Hungarian, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, some Arabic.

34:14.938 --> 34:22.045
So, I'm assuming, correctly, I'm sure, that Lloyd is not fluent in 32 languages.

34:22.285 --> 34:22.545
Nope.

34:22.766 --> 34:23.546
So, that's fine.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.468
How does he know what he's getting?

34:25.549 --> 34:29.633
Is he just, I mean, is he using, is he relying on the advice?

34:29.713 --> 34:35.659
He uses agents in some cases, all the Chinese material he's been buying the last couple of years.

34:36.179 --> 34:38.262
He's an antiques dealer, I gather.

34:38.322 --> 34:42.948
He's not weighing significance, or he's not even factoring that in, is he?

34:42.968 --> 34:51.781
No, he's trying to get, I think, the idea with buying all the 20th century Chinese books would simply get as much as possible.

34:52.882 --> 34:59.051
So apparently there's all this, it sounds like stuff that never got unpacked from the Cultural Revolution.

34:59.071 --> 35:02.035
We've got a copy of it now.

35:02.723 --> 35:06.707
And he's going to do the same thing for Japanese books, I hear now.

35:06.727 --> 35:17.157
But when he announced this, negotiated it, funded it, got this space, what's your square footage here?

35:17.177 --> 35:18.658
I don't care about that sort of thing.

35:18.839 --> 35:20.560
But I mean, you have a fixed space here.

35:21.001 --> 35:25.145
And yet you're getting twice the library that was anticipated.

35:25.785 --> 35:27.687
Maybe larger.

35:28.048 --> 35:30.710
So you're already basically probably out of space.

35:30.730 --> 35:32.612
Yeah, I'm in that capacity now, essentially.

35:32.845 --> 35:34.607
Well, let's see.

35:35.248 --> 35:37.410
I'm not sure how much we'll get in the room there.

35:38.972 --> 35:39.693
That's about four.

35:39.933 --> 35:42.857
That's a quarter of it, actually.

35:42.877 --> 35:44.318
That's about four of it, yeah.

35:46.081 --> 35:56.693
Is that high spots or stuff that's visually... Well, that's the problem with... No, actually, a lot of it, frankly, believe it or not, is very...

35:59.153 --> 36:21.364
carefully calculated how i could get the most member books up there so it worked it worked up to be almost a perfect mesh the the 20th century imprint in english language uh from the seconds yeah no they're the third and almost all the second

36:21.479 --> 36:23.122
Do you call them tiers, by the way?

36:23.142 --> 36:24.764
What do you call them?

36:24.804 --> 36:26.347
Well, I guess you'd say they're floors.

36:26.367 --> 36:29.892
The third floor, the top floor, and the middle floor.

36:30.814 --> 36:37.885
And I had to fill in the last few just because for the opening.

36:38.607 --> 36:55.030
The bottom range in the gallery on into the entrance are the books in English and European languages up to 1840, excluding the oversize.

36:55.110 --> 36:58.535
Now, this excludes all the oversize.

36:58.696 --> 37:03.422
You see, what you've done, that's the essence of the Harvard model, is you've eliminated the air.

37:04.364 --> 37:06.066
Well, I pretty much had to.

37:06.805 --> 37:23.689
And part of the reason, frankly, the reason why I have 16th, 17th, 18th, and early 19th century materials in there is because after about 1840, formats start getting significantly larger on the average, whereas here you can set the shelves about 10 inches apart.

37:23.709 --> 37:26.233
Are they stuffed animals, or are they just stuffed animals, or are they significant?

37:26.273 --> 37:27.174
No, they are significant.

37:27.214 --> 37:29.978
They're significant.

37:30.937 --> 37:58.564
was made by a woman on a big island in hawaii he was in a general store in the corner lloyd asked the owner of the store and she said no the woman said well maybe she'd make me a copy well anyway she would go to me and i uh anyway so when uh we knew opening day was coming i called up by the university

37:59.219 --> 38:00.882
So that's a copy, or that's the one?

38:00.962 --> 38:03.025
Yeah, that's the one, and he was in Neutrogena.

38:03.065 --> 38:06.150
There were all kinds of animals in the Neutrogena headquarters, one of the boys.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.832
He liked to do interior decorating.

38:07.892 --> 38:11.057
Anyway, so I just said, ah, I'll send you Harry.

38:11.137 --> 38:12.700
I said, Arnie, there's a sheep left.

38:13.701 --> 38:15.885
So we have one of the eight Neutrogena sheep.

38:16.386 --> 38:17.387
And they are?

38:17.587 --> 38:20.873
Oh, she's in the corner of the interior.

38:20.893 --> 38:21.974
I saw her there.

38:22.255 --> 38:22.776
Yeah.

38:22.796 --> 38:23.837
I took back there for the picture.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.500
Now, the chicken, actually, I bought.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.623
Lloyd told me that...

38:28.396 --> 38:35.763
What did you say, the figure was $2,000 or $3,000 and my daughter could pick out more animals for the space.

38:36.344 --> 38:38.686
Now we got the camel and we got the chicken.

38:38.826 --> 38:40.247
How old was your daughter?

38:40.888 --> 38:41.448
Oh, wonderful.

38:41.488 --> 38:42.349
She must have had them all.

38:42.710 --> 38:44.211
She probably wanted to take them home.

38:44.231 --> 38:48.815
Well, actually, we haven't spent all our allotments, so I'm just waiting.

38:48.835 --> 38:51.178
So tell me, what did your daughter pick?

38:51.378 --> 38:51.918
The chicken.

38:52.159 --> 38:56.603
The chicken is actually made by a Pennsylvania stuffed animal maker.

38:56.643 --> 38:57.403
What's your daughter's name?

38:57.544 --> 38:57.964
Claire.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.011
C-L-A-A-R?

38:59.712 --> 39:00.072
E-N-A-N?

39:00.112 --> 39:00.372
E-N-A-N.

39:00.473 --> 39:05.558
And the camel we found in Vermont when we were out visiting at Christmas.

39:06.459 --> 39:15.969
Actually, I think I would like to actually contact the woman that made the little red hen and see if she'd make me the rest of the sky that's falling in, and then we can put them all around.

39:16.570 --> 39:17.932
It's a fox and a scary fox.

39:17.952 --> 39:19.914
Have you had a lot of kids in here?

39:20.374 --> 39:24.259
Yeah, I'd say most days we get between 10 and 20, sometimes more.

39:24.319 --> 39:27.462
So far, it's maybe three to five.

39:27.762 --> 39:54.445
school groups a month we could certainly handle more but we've still been wrestling with things like maintenance contracts and i've been very reluctant to publicize until we get all that straight back because of course the more people come through the more often things break and the more often you have to have it serviced and you want everything up and running what's what's the reaction of the of the student body oh they like it oh yeah you can see him coming in and explain time to waste time

39:54.779 --> 39:57.482
I bet some would like to come in and read here if they could.

39:57.502 --> 39:58.122
Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:58.142 --> 39:59.023
Do you allow it?

39:59.524 --> 40:09.554
I see a couple of brochures I'm going to grab to.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.195
Go ahead.

40:10.215 --> 40:13.018
And so I think you're about to tell me this is room for more books in here.

40:13.218 --> 40:18.383
Yeah, but I'm probably going to fill it all up easy and I might still not get everything in that's in the fall.

40:18.403 --> 40:21.246
You could probably get a couple thousand books in here, maybe.

40:21.266 --> 40:23.048
No, more than that.

40:24.327 --> 40:28.532
I'll probably get all the 19th century imprints.

40:28.552 --> 40:31.256
I'll probably get most of the oversize.

40:34.620 --> 40:37.323
But it's like the pamphlets, the graphic.

40:37.343 --> 40:39.466
I mean, all these papers are going to have.

40:39.486 --> 40:40.928
I have to find another paper.

40:40.948 --> 40:44.412
Has there been much interest expressed by the scholarly community?

40:45.113 --> 40:45.994
They're starting to come.

40:46.094 --> 40:51.421
Most of them come from this.

40:51.441 --> 40:53.203
I got it.

40:54.314 --> 40:57.117
That welcome to the library.

40:57.397 --> 41:01.420
That's lovely.

41:01.441 --> 41:07.446
I like everything.

41:07.466 --> 41:12.411
Great.

41:13.572 --> 41:18.856
Most of the visitors we've had so far have not been within the priesthood.

41:18.876 --> 41:21.619
Does this have anything to say about that?

41:21.639 --> 41:21.739
Yeah.

41:24.706 --> 41:33.877
I might just bring my wife and girls over here.

41:35.198 --> 41:37.201
My older daughter is looking at the university.

41:37.441 --> 41:49.195
She's a wonderful kid and a great student.

41:49.934 --> 41:51.738
It's got to be probably one of the most competitive.

41:51.758 --> 41:53.983
They're looking for leadership qualities, I think.

41:54.003 --> 41:57.490
Well, she's the named head monitor at her school for next year.

41:57.550 --> 42:04.065
She's a swimmer and she's the editor of her paint on all leadership kinds of things.

42:04.105 --> 42:04.385
Really?

42:04.465 --> 42:05.828
Yep, yep.

42:05.848 --> 42:06.650
Looking for leadership.

42:06.991 --> 42:07.993
They are, indeed.

42:08.564 --> 42:09.706
Very much so.

42:09.826 --> 42:15.353
She's the first girl to be named head monitor at Worcester Academy, I think, and, you know, whatever.

42:15.413 --> 42:17.236
But for this leadership, that's great.

42:17.336 --> 42:18.137
Yeah.

42:18.177 --> 42:19.339
Well, I gather that.

42:19.359 --> 42:21.782
Middlebury likes her swimming time, so.

42:21.942 --> 42:23.084
I think they all like that.

42:23.264 --> 42:23.484
Yeah.

42:24.105 --> 42:25.967
They all like the athletics.

42:25.987 --> 42:29.813
My feeling is anyone who gets it would be very lucky.

42:29.833 --> 42:30.614
Well, good.

42:30.894 --> 42:32.917
That's the story.

42:33.458 --> 42:33.678
Yeah.

42:33.698 --> 42:34.018
Let's see.

42:34.058 --> 42:35.280
Who have we had come visit?

42:35.598 --> 42:47.130
Let's see, we've had, from Germany, we've had Dr. Walter Sauer, who's an expert in Schruppelkater.

42:48.212 --> 42:53.838
We've had Jerry Slocum, who collects puzzles of all sorts.

42:55.059 --> 42:58.102
He has a puzzle museum in the back of his house in Beverly Hills.

42:58.122 --> 42:59.143
He's fascinating.

42:59.163 --> 43:03.428
I believe he was an engineer by profession.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.719
Actually, he did one of the .

43:07.739 --> 43:12.303
Oh, that's good.

43:12.644 --> 43:13.204
Oh, that's nice.

43:14.305 --> 43:14.806
Look at that.

43:14.906 --> 43:20.071
But he's also a very serious scholar of puzzles, and he's working on the history of the tangram right now.

43:20.111 --> 43:20.772
Which one do you call it?

43:20.792 --> 43:28.299
The tangram, which is the seven pieces, geometric pieces, which can be put together.

43:28.319 --> 43:29.380
Oh, sure, yeah.

43:29.420 --> 43:34.005
He's busy researching where that came from in China and how it got to the West.

43:35.015 --> 43:48.248
um let's see who else has come um let's see we've also had um oh right one of the uh shelby shelly davis

43:48.835 --> 43:51.858
Collin Davis Fellows in history, and they soon came in.

43:52.959 --> 44:05.431
She's working, she's very interested in, she's actually started out as a historian of medicine, and now she, I think she works, she's more, that's cultural history, but anyway, she was doing a paper on rat catchers.

44:06.032 --> 44:13.459
And so she came to look at, she found some things here that were useful, and it wasn't the Pied Piper panel.

44:16.002 --> 44:17.543
Let's see how else we can.

44:18.282 --> 44:19.944
Yeah, well, I'm forgetting.

44:20.404 --> 44:23.206
Yeah, they're mostly from outside the university.

44:23.227 --> 44:25.849
Do they know it's here?

44:27.030 --> 44:28.331
You mean the Princeton faculty?

44:28.411 --> 44:31.354
No, but I mean these people coming here.

44:31.374 --> 44:33.556
Yeah, they came specifically.

44:33.636 --> 44:38.360
So is the contents of the library pretty well out there?

44:38.460 --> 44:38.701
No.

44:39.822 --> 44:45.707
Okay, what I can do is...

44:47.307 --> 44:50.631
Is it fairly well catalogued?

44:50.651 --> 44:51.431
Oh, yeah.

44:51.491 --> 44:52.973
We have a record for everything.

44:54.054 --> 44:57.938
And then Ivy sends us updates of the material.

44:59.720 --> 45:14.496
What we have at the moment is Microsoft Access, which is not user-friendly.

45:15.674 --> 45:19.059
Of course, you have some extraordinarily rare things, too.

45:19.119 --> 45:20.420
Oh, now, here's some.

45:20.721 --> 45:25.387
Now, I'll just stand up here.

45:25.507 --> 45:31.676
It's an illustrated catalog with a story put out by the big Berlin department store.

45:32.357 --> 45:34.640
I would guess in the 20s, but anyway, here it is.

45:34.660 --> 45:36.102
It's a prize picture.

45:37.003 --> 45:38.105
Everything's a baby's room.

45:39.206 --> 45:42.190
Kids' clothes.

45:42.210 --> 45:43.572
Oh, did you say this one?

45:44.108 --> 45:47.712
I would guess it's in the 20s.

45:54.418 --> 46:08.152
He has this because he does collect advertising ephemera that relate to kids, either if they use characters from children's books, for example, or like this.

46:08.352 --> 46:13.137
It's actual products produced for children.

46:13.640 --> 46:16.984
Another catalog of the same company is Celluloid Toys.

46:19.627 --> 46:24.072
So anyway, we have the records, we have the catalog records in here.

46:24.092 --> 46:41.773
This is one I've worked over and added a note, so... So people can access this from... No, this is essentially, at this point it's an in-house file, partly because it has all the acquisitions information, and one of the many things we have to do is

46:43.458 --> 46:50.006
come up with a way of mounting the data that's fit for public consumption.

46:50.026 --> 46:57.956
So what kinds of things can a scholar from Germany or France or England find here that they can't find?

46:57.976 --> 47:00.540
Obviously, there must be things here.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.422
It would be mostly the earlier material.

47:02.442 --> 47:03.603
If you have it here.

47:04.184 --> 47:04.465
Yeah.

47:04.545 --> 47:08.790
Well, of course, the Germans are light years ahead of us.

47:09.800 --> 47:13.725
appreciation and analysis of historical children's books.

47:13.825 --> 47:16.068
They're very serious about it.

47:16.228 --> 47:23.697
A lot more important catalogs, exhibition catalogs and things that come out of Germany just all the time.

47:23.717 --> 47:28.143
I regret to say I don't know.

47:28.163 --> 47:33.530
I haven't really made contact with prospective colleagues in Germany.

47:33.570 --> 47:39.537
It's something I hope I can do in the next few years because I'd really like to start

47:40.512 --> 47:44.537
So have you anticipated one question that I asked about the response?

47:44.617 --> 47:47.501
And you said among Princeton people?

47:47.801 --> 47:50.465
Well, that wasn't a question I was asking, but it's a very good question.

47:51.526 --> 47:55.992
Well, Princeton in some ways is still very the Princeton it was.

47:56.112 --> 47:57.114
It's changed a lot.

47:57.294 --> 48:09.810
But I get more points for having Princeton faculty and Princeton students come in and use the collection, I think, rather than I can say.

48:10.010 --> 48:12.693
Oh, I had such-and-such from so-and-so come and visit him.

48:12.733 --> 48:16.298
Doesn't compute.

48:16.979 --> 48:17.399
That's right.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.024
That would make a point.

48:21.044 --> 48:23.847
Well, actually, now, what's his name?

48:24.788 --> 48:29.875
He's just retired from art and archaeology, and he's writing his autobiography.

48:30.175 --> 48:34.961
And he came in about two weeks ago, and he said, and this is the sort of question you get all the time.

48:37.044 --> 48:38.886
I had a book when I was a kid.

48:39.710 --> 48:41.072
I don't remember the title.

48:41.152 --> 48:42.413
I don't remember the author.

48:42.734 --> 48:43.675
It was this big.

48:43.695 --> 48:44.416
It was green.

48:44.836 --> 48:46.518
There was a unicorn in it.

48:47.480 --> 48:48.721
Can you help me find it?

48:49.182 --> 48:50.603
What happens so often?

48:50.864 --> 48:52.025
All the time.

48:52.065 --> 48:53.847
That's probably the commonest question you get.

48:53.908 --> 48:55.810
That's great.

48:55.830 --> 48:57.692
Sometimes you can answer them, sometimes you can't.

48:57.712 --> 48:58.934
It depends on how good their memory was.

48:58.954 --> 49:00.596
Well, he came in with one of those questions.

49:00.636 --> 49:06.443
He said, now, we had it just before we were told to evacuate Pearl Harbor.

49:07.030 --> 49:10.594
And my sister, I thought my sister brought it and she didn't.

49:10.614 --> 49:22.325
And it's absolutely crucial to my development because one of these pictures, this is one of my pictures, these pictures, I, you know, attribute to my whole interest in whatever I said.

49:22.345 --> 49:22.505
Wow.

49:22.705 --> 49:23.646
I said, okay.

49:24.047 --> 49:24.928
I'm serious then.

49:24.948 --> 49:26.289
And he said, he said, now.

49:26.549 --> 49:34.077
He said it was this big and it had orange lettering on the cover and it had cats dressed up.

49:35.798 --> 49:36.379
And I thought,

49:37.675 --> 49:41.779
I thought, mister, you don't know how many books there are with cats dressed up in clothes.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.162
And I thought, whew.

49:44.182 --> 49:47.446
Now, he hadn't identified himself at that point as a Princeton faculty member.

49:47.746 --> 49:51.891
And I said, well, okay, what else can you tell me about it?

49:51.971 --> 49:56.936
He said, oh, the illustrations were photographed.

49:56.956 --> 49:57.256
I said, mm-hmm.

49:57.276 --> 50:00.240
He said, and I think... Yeah, he did.

50:00.600 --> 50:07.007
Well, the thing is, his recollections were so precise, I was pretty sure that... I was pretty... Well, and he said, now, I think...

50:08.050 --> 50:10.574
I think it was the four little kittens.

50:11.455 --> 50:12.116
I said, okay.

50:12.196 --> 50:12.737
Oh, he thinks.

50:13.257 --> 50:15.260
He said, he thinks.

50:15.280 --> 50:18.204
So I went into the database.

50:20.067 --> 50:27.117
I searched under subject cats, and I searched the collation for a truncated photograph, and two books came.

50:27.217 --> 50:28.318
You have all that detail.

50:28.338 --> 50:28.739
Well, here.

50:28.839 --> 50:31.563
Actually, I can show you exactly how I did it.

50:31.583 --> 50:32.484
Actually, it was pretty good.

50:32.524 --> 50:34.066
I didn't myself.

50:34.086 --> 50:35.408
I hate to stop the narrative.

50:35.428 --> 50:37.551
It's a great story, but keep going.

50:37.902 --> 50:41.085
Well, the funny thing was, it took me about five minutes to do it.

50:41.105 --> 50:41.746
Walking was here?

50:42.066 --> 50:43.147
He was standing right there.

50:43.928 --> 50:45.330
Did he remember it when you found it?

50:46.871 --> 50:47.552
Yeah, for a second.

50:47.592 --> 50:50.035
Oh, then you went and got the book for him.

50:50.055 --> 50:50.335
I did.

50:50.395 --> 50:52.437
Oh, you better remember his name from me, by the way.

50:53.178 --> 50:53.678
I'll have to.

50:53.779 --> 50:54.579
He gave me his card.

50:54.679 --> 50:59.224
Actually, Dan will remember his name.

50:59.244 --> 51:00.145
I might even give him a call.

51:02.287 --> 51:02.668
It'll help.

51:04.049 --> 51:04.770
Okay, here we go.

51:07.349 --> 51:08.851
So I typed out the records.

51:08.871 --> 51:10.153
Okay, Tiger's King, 1997.

51:10.253 --> 51:11.755
It obviously isn't that.

51:12.676 --> 51:13.918
He was sitting right here.

51:13.958 --> 51:14.940
He was sitting right here.

51:16.622 --> 51:17.343
Why should I pull that?

51:17.463 --> 51:18.465
Okay, here it was.

51:18.545 --> 51:20.007
It says Four Little Kittens.

51:20.127 --> 51:24.293
Oh, and he said in it, so it was in 1930-something.

51:24.313 --> 51:28.779
So here was 1934, Four Little Kittens with photographic illustrations.

51:28.899 --> 51:32.344
I knew that had to be it, so I went up in the wall and pulled it down.

51:32.746 --> 51:33.487
Put it down.

51:33.848 --> 51:39.415
This is about, actually, about five minutes after he came in.

51:41.558 --> 51:42.740
He's the author of this book?

51:42.940 --> 51:46.725
This book is, actually, I can print this out.

51:47.086 --> 51:48.308
I can print this out.

51:48.328 --> 51:49.489
Get this guy's name for me.

51:49.609 --> 51:51.071
I won't surprise him.

51:51.092 --> 51:51.752
We'll give him a call.

51:51.973 --> 51:54.456
Oh, I think he's very nice.

51:54.656 --> 51:57.380
He's a well-known, somebody like that.

51:57.781 --> 51:58.221
Yeah.

51:58.322 --> 52:02.247
Also, he actually knows Lloyd, or knew Lloyd from Princeton.

52:05.382 --> 52:06.283
That's a great story.

52:06.924 --> 52:10.169
Well, I must say, I usually can't pull a rabbit out of the hat.

52:10.349 --> 52:12.933
You pull four kitties out of the hat.

52:12.953 --> 52:14.495
But it's his, you know.

52:14.655 --> 52:18.922
But often people's recollection of their childhood books is surprisingly accurate.

52:19.883 --> 52:22.587
I mean, it sounds like they must be making it up.

52:22.687 --> 52:26.933
But if you put it together often, if they think it was green, it was white.

52:26.953 --> 52:30.098
He'd have been a candidate for hypnosis, you know, how the hypnosis could have pulled out of him.

52:32.241 --> 52:35.085
I had a volume of Shakespeare when I went to Bates.

52:36.280 --> 52:46.610
Oh my God, I hope she doesn't bite his head off.

52:47.211 --> 52:51.615
But this is when people come in and ask you these kinds of things, and a lot of times you can't.

52:51.635 --> 52:57.261
Well, part of the reason I can't do it is because, at least in the 20th century, it's selective.

52:57.321 --> 52:58.422
It's not exhaustive.

52:59.243 --> 53:05.629
And when people come up with this, the collection just isn't that deep in the 20th century to pull it out.

53:06.166 --> 53:11.753
That's someplace where Library of Congress would probably do better with that kind of inquiry that people ask.

53:11.913 --> 53:15.477
Does this library yet support the curriculum?

53:15.777 --> 53:18.500
Is there anything in the curriculum yet that... No, no, no.

53:18.520 --> 53:32.697
Well, of course, there's a professor in the English department, there's Louie Neffelmacher, who teaches children's literature and also does graduate seminars.

53:34.043 --> 53:44.193
Now, I heard a rumor last week that the history department has hired somebody in the history of education, but I don't know what exactly that means.

53:44.213 --> 53:55.203
I don't know if that means he does one specific time period in one country, or if he does... Well, that would be great.

53:55.763 --> 53:56.564
That would be great.

53:57.725 --> 54:03.831
That would answer a lot of... Well, the people who are likely to use the question

54:04.486 --> 54:12.757
here, I think, may not be interested in children's books per se, but they may find children's books useful to their projects.

54:15.861 --> 54:29.920
Now, when she was a senior, a junior, she was doing a paper, and she wanted to do a sociological analysis of literature at the end of the 19th century, and she was interested, and I said, well,

54:30.440 --> 54:37.087
We went round and round, and I said, well, you said, how about trying the Andrew Lang Collar fairy tale books?

54:37.868 --> 54:39.410
Because then you wanted to.

54:39.450 --> 54:42.973
They came out during a very precise period.

54:43.814 --> 54:53.865
There's bound to be a fair amount of response out there, because of the way all the books are set up with identifying the origin of the story.

54:54.605 --> 55:15.769
so she went to town on that and was quite happy because then she didn't need to she started out using the rare editions but i pointed out to her that the other advantages of course a lot of these have been reprinted or you can check them out of the stacks and so you wouldn't need to rely on the copies here but it got her started we had another woman who did a

55:16.373 --> 55:26.084
did a junior paper on images of the Philippines and American children's books in the first quarter of the century.

55:26.865 --> 55:29.288
Well, the funny thing was that she came.

55:30.029 --> 55:32.792
I managed to find her four books, which absolutely floored me.

55:32.832 --> 55:37.337
I didn't think I had to work hard for that one.

55:37.357 --> 55:38.178
And then she went away.

55:38.658 --> 55:40.400
And I thought, well, okay, I guess it didn't work.

55:40.441 --> 55:44.425
And then she came back, maybe three months later, to say thank you.

55:44.465 --> 55:46.127
And then she needed pictures.

55:46.580 --> 55:53.485
We have a graduate student in the English department right now.

55:56.266 --> 56:19.246
working late 18th, early 19th century, and she's doing something on, I think, the construction of femininity, and she's looking at books on dolls, and she's been swatting away on them for most of the summer, so I found her five or six books in the time period she wanted, and I assume, you know, she's still got the books out, and she's coming in a couple times a week, so I assume she's happy, and she doesn't need me, so.

56:19.366 --> 56:19.907
It will happen.

56:20.288 --> 56:20.468
Oh, yeah.

56:20.937 --> 56:24.040
It's going to take a while.

56:24.100 --> 56:28.764
Princeton isn't that crazy about having scholars come from all over the world to use it.

56:30.786 --> 56:32.168
It's just for my own... Oh, yeah.

56:32.488 --> 56:38.794
Well, I know you're going to talk to Tony Grassman, so don't repeat what I'm saying.

56:38.814 --> 56:41.196
Yeah, they tend... Well, all right.

56:41.296 --> 56:42.277
I'll give you an example.

56:43.599 --> 56:44.700
This is off the record.

56:44.740 --> 56:48.143
My husband was at the Clark Library at UCLA for a long time.

56:48.713 --> 56:59.808
And because they have a very extensive collection of Oscar Wilde manuscripts, he was working over the years with Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson, because he's the literary executor of the estate.

57:01.290 --> 57:10.321
So Merlin's just finished another important book on his grandfather, and he was coming through the East on, you know, book tour or whatever.

57:10.361 --> 57:15.328
And he asked John if there was any way that he could maybe come and give a lecture at Princeton.

57:15.764 --> 57:17.246
You know, he's a professional writer.

57:17.266 --> 57:18.929
He needs these to live on.

57:18.949 --> 57:20.050
So, and John knows this.

57:20.070 --> 57:23.055
So John knew he wanted to get him a good honorarium.

57:24.737 --> 57:30.446
Well, the attitude tends to be, well, but we're giving them a venue in Princeton.

57:30.486 --> 57:33.450
What do they name you for?

57:34.632 --> 57:35.253
I know that.

57:36.435 --> 57:40.441
There's always one.

57:40.461 --> 57:41.763
Was it for me, by the way?

57:41.823 --> 57:42.885
Yes, in that way.

57:42.905 --> 57:45.248
And I said, Dan will remember.

57:45.835 --> 58:03.361
The reason I find it a little funny is after working at the Morgan and the Huntington and UCLA, it may partly be because most of my experience has been in independent research libraries, where your mission is much clearer.

58:04.002 --> 58:12.214
People come to your library to use your collections, and people come from all over, and so I just find it a little odd that

58:12.751 --> 58:16.736
Princeton would be... Oh, dear.

58:16.856 --> 58:19.659
I never let people take pictures of me.

58:19.679 --> 58:23.944
Just that Princeton would tend to be that parochial still.

58:24.124 --> 58:26.267
I got one.

58:26.647 --> 58:28.389
This may just be my response.

58:29.090 --> 58:41.104
It may be an idiosyncratic response, but... But you're treated with the utmost civility and not as it's... Stafford, stafford, stafford.

58:42.046 --> 59:05.708
Well, I mean, one thing that Lloyd had said was, well, I mean, he wanted, he said he wants the best librarian, and he wants to pay whatever it takes to do that, and that there was, I don't have that.

59:08.692 --> 59:36.943
academic librarian as a book librarian one of the real problems facing the profession is that right now there's nobody behind my generation to come and take the jobs and so i guess i don't know part of it we haven't been we haven't been reaching out to the right people to make sure that the next generation's custodians are coming coming along and will take take good care of

59:37.497 --> 59:39.119
the collections they're in charge of.

59:39.139 --> 59:42.865
It doesn't help that Columbia dissolves its life.

59:42.945 --> 59:46.290
Well, I think it's part of the whole environment in the last 10 or 20 years.

59:46.430 --> 59:51.617
Anybody in an in-quote so-called service profession, well, I mean, why would you be in one if you weren't a wuss?

59:51.657 --> 59:53.881
You'd be out in business having your own.

59:53.941 --> 59:54.241
Right.

59:55.643 --> 01:00:00.991
So outreach does weigh very heavily on some people's minds.

01:00:01.151 --> 01:00:02.593
If we don't start

01:00:03.704 --> 01:00:16.881
I don't like to say promoting and publicizing ourselves, because I don't know if that's exactly what we're doing, but if we aren't getting younger people engaged in the whole idea of what goes on and why it matters.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:18.123
Let me talk about librarianship.

01:00:18.143 --> 01:00:20.326
Yeah, librarianship, and especially rare book librarianship.

01:00:20.346 --> 01:00:21.167
There's no money in it.

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:26.714
I mean, you can make a whole lot more money managing a system for a business or whatever.

01:00:26.754 --> 01:00:27.915
I mean, there's no doubt about it.

01:00:27.935 --> 01:00:28.736
You'll make more money.

01:00:29.337 --> 01:00:31.500
You'll probably get more recognition.

01:00:32.223 --> 01:00:42.638
for having done it but this is great this is fun though well i think it's i think it's important i think it's important but it's not the sort of thing that you can stand up on the top of buildings
