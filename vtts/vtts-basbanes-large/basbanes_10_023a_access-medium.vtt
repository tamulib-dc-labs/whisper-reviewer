00:04.300 --> 00:25.920
talking to mr charles pierce at the morgan library i'm just going to put this here here don't worry about it it's just there that is perfect that's for you oh that's great thank you well that's wonderful thank you you can kind of uh

00:26.525 --> 00:39.503
I think I mentioned to Gloria that there's a new edition of my book.

00:39.603 --> 00:40.785
It's coming out in March.

00:41.005 --> 00:42.187
It's the first paperback.

00:42.948 --> 00:46.934
And so I have updated it, but I also wrote a little introduction for it.

00:46.954 --> 00:53.443
And I used that introduction as an opportunity to write about Carter and the collection coming here.

00:53.828 --> 01:03.099
I don't know if you read the book, but in the very first chapter, I talk about three collectors, three French, and deciding, you know, different fates for their books.

01:03.359 --> 01:13.871
And in one year, we have Carter, we have Chef Louis Zathmary, and we have Haskell Norman, three people who are in my book, and each of whom did dramatically different things.

01:14.392 --> 01:15.533
So I use that...

01:15.817 --> 01:16.598
You'll be pleased.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.700
I quoted from a release.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.261
I quoted you.

01:19.301 --> 01:19.781
You're quoted.

01:21.984 --> 01:24.647
I remember seeing that part.

01:25.267 --> 01:28.391
Thank you.

01:28.431 --> 01:35.819
I'm delighted that Carter's collection found such a worthwhile home.

01:36.299 --> 01:39.303
This is a statement about the direction of the Morgan estate.

01:39.343 --> 01:42.646
Would you say that you are really entering the 20th century?

01:42.827 --> 01:44.068
Absolutely.

01:44.960 --> 02:00.957
We have, I mean, it must have been about four or five years ago that I actually had a decision, a discussion with the Board of Trustees about the fact that I thought we should make a commitment to collect in the 20th century in the fine fields of the Morgan Library.

02:01.538 --> 02:11.929
So we should do this with regard to pretty books and literary and historical and musical autographed manuscripts, and we should do it with drawings.

02:12.770 --> 02:27.388
And we certainly ought to do it in American literature, as well as in world literature, in English by and large, or in the major Western European languages.

02:27.409 --> 02:40.465
So, at the time we made that decision, we were really making the decision, A, to collect in the 20th century, and B, to collect more aggressively in the American field,

02:40.934 --> 02:45.820
So, American manuscript, American for the book, American drawing.

02:45.840 --> 02:54.411
And I think both make perfect sense because they're both consistent with what Pierpont Morgan and his son Jack Morgan did.

02:55.132 --> 03:02.462
They did collect in the American field, but less aggressively in the American field than in the European field.

03:02.482 --> 03:06.467
What helps you make this decision about the need to enter the 20th century?

03:06.507 --> 03:08.730
Maybe there's a role of this kind of a library.

03:09.554 --> 03:19.065
Well, I think that, as I said, first of all, it just is consistent with the initial collecting interest of the founders.

03:19.085 --> 03:29.797
Pierre Baumoling, for example, did buy manuscripts written by writers who have been deemed great writers of his own time in the 1890s.

03:29.817 --> 03:36.264
He bought with Ned Wilson and the Wife of the Mississippi by Twain, and he bought Oscar Wilde.

03:36.304 --> 03:38.987
There's a famous quote from Mark Twain that you...

03:38.967 --> 03:39.869
That's right.

03:39.889 --> 03:40.911
And permanent exhibition.

03:40.932 --> 03:42.114
That's right.

03:42.134 --> 03:46.003
An august company, I guess, is the kind of that you use for one of your books.

03:46.745 --> 03:50.233
Clearly an American resonance there.

03:50.634 --> 03:51.195
Absolutely.

03:52.157 --> 03:53.280
And so if...

03:53.767 --> 04:10.030
If Morgan can in the 1890s collect objects from his own time, that certainly seems to me, in the library, as it nears the end of the 20th century, we've only got 11 months to go.

04:10.350 --> 04:19.403
We certainly, on the same highly selective basis, with real attention to rarity and quality and so on, try to collect the best things that we possibly can.

04:19.822 --> 04:31.835
And when Carter's collection came along, I mean, there was American literature from 1870, really right down into this decade, being served up on this enormous sort of time.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.797
And it is, in fact, a research collection, too.

04:33.817 --> 04:33.917
Yeah.

04:34.698 --> 04:36.560
It's very comprehensive, as you know.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.062
It's very thorough.

04:38.082 --> 04:40.625
He cared a lot about conditions.

04:40.645 --> 04:44.028
He was very interested in association copies.

04:46.691 --> 04:48.293
He wanted to...

04:49.049 --> 04:53.255
very traditional, very major, and many, many, many, minor, rather.

04:53.275 --> 05:02.647
Of course, it's Richard manuscripts and other materials, which make it very, as we press on the Pinchon material, make it clear.

05:04.409 --> 05:09.816
You know, it's interesting, I did three interviews with Carter for my book, and I was in the apartment.

05:10.638 --> 05:15.384
I never had, he kept that pretty quiet, that Pinchon material.

05:15.524 --> 05:15.804
Oh, yeah.

05:15.824 --> 05:17.807
I never, that was news to me.

05:18.665 --> 05:26.572
My editor, Holt, about to be former editor who's leaving the company is Ray Roberts, by the way.

05:26.672 --> 05:28.294
In fact, I'm having lunch from him today.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.876
I didn't mention that, by the way.

05:30.896 --> 05:35.440
That just didn't seem relevant to use in that introduction.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.523
I mean, it's relevant as a story, but it didn't seem relevant there.

05:38.964 --> 05:44.008
This is an extraordinary coup for you, the Sir Paul Getty Library.

05:44.028 --> 05:45.209
I'm jumping.

05:46.551 --> 05:48.132
But this is quite a coup for you.

05:48.584 --> 05:51.928
Tell me a little bit about that, how this happened.

05:51.968 --> 06:08.909
Well, I knew he, I had met him through a mutual friend, I guess five or six years ago, and when I met him, he asked me how the Board of Aubrey was doing, and I told him I thought the Board of Aubrey was doing just fine.

06:08.929 --> 06:14.155
He said, we were rather sorry to hear that, because he was rather hoping he might go to buy a few of our objects.

06:14.235 --> 06:14.776
Come on.

06:14.796 --> 06:15.537
No, totally.

06:16.343 --> 06:19.468
And he was really very sweet and funny about it.

06:19.488 --> 06:38.036
So I said, well, that's not the situation, but would you ever consider allowing the library to be a host, a site, or an exhibition of some of your greatest books, especially as they relate to the art of the book?

06:38.056 --> 06:43.785
And so one thing sort of led to another, and this eventually came to pass.

06:44.170 --> 06:56.669
And I'm intrigued that this collection has not yet been shown publicly in England, and I don't know whether it will be now or not.

06:56.909 --> 07:00.855
Certainly, one would think that it would be a natural for the British Library to do it.

07:00.875 --> 07:05.963
You'd think so, but I was really astonished at this announcement.

07:06.344 --> 07:13.114
I tried to get in to see that live already two years ago, and I talked with the Manx.

07:13.617 --> 07:16.240
Even Bryant didn't want to talk to me about it.

07:16.741 --> 07:20.566
But it was pretty clear that they really didn't want that.

07:20.586 --> 07:22.368
I don't think it was anything personal against me.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.271
It was just that they didn't want the public.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.033
I mean, I made it very clear why I wanted to come in.

07:26.053 --> 07:27.635
I wanted to write about it.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.419
And they said, no, this is not the time.

07:30.479 --> 07:32.001
So apparently this is.

07:32.101 --> 07:35.225
So I finally, I don't know what's going on in this new book.

07:35.285 --> 07:35.545
I do.

07:35.645 --> 07:36.286
But we'll see.

07:36.306 --> 07:37.287
This is quite likely.

07:38.309 --> 07:40.131
I'm writing a book about libraries.

07:40.600 --> 08:02.203
uh libraries of the future libraries through history book people booksellers we'll see my eclectic manner but uh um so it's it's open to the public now i guess oh yeah it's a public exhibition but i mean officially it's open yes

08:02.369 --> 08:03.992
And how was your function last night?

08:04.012 --> 08:04.693
It was fine.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.316
It was fine.

08:06.756 --> 08:27.010
It was a more modest reception than simply many that we've had, but I think it has to do with everything from winter to the flu, the fact that these are, this is the week of major auctions of Sotheby's and Christie's, and there are also a lot of major meetings of people that we over here for a few of those functions.

08:27.547 --> 08:37.117
We'll see, but I think we hope there's a review that might be coming out from the time, Friday or Monday or whatever.

08:37.137 --> 08:41.662
Only in New York could you have the Wolfenbeutel at the Grollier Club and this.

08:41.902 --> 08:44.665
I mean, really spectacular.

08:44.805 --> 08:45.926
Absolutely spectacular.

08:46.387 --> 08:47.648
And fresh, really.

08:48.289 --> 08:49.851
And you point out this is a first here.

08:50.131 --> 08:53.134
That's pretty much a first over at the Grollier.

08:53.154 --> 08:53.835
Oh, absolutely.

08:53.855 --> 08:55.056
It's wonderful.

08:56.369 --> 09:03.958
Do you have any thoughts on the role of a library like this as we enter the 21st century?

09:03.978 --> 09:14.790
I've been invited to participate in an ALA symposium next year, the year 2000, and the concept is the museum of the book.

09:14.930 --> 09:19.275
Are all libraries becoming museums, and are all books becoming museum objects?

09:19.355 --> 09:20.296
I don't think.

09:20.316 --> 09:22.258
Do you have any thoughts on that?

09:22.745 --> 09:29.852
Well my thought about the future of an independent research library of this sort is that

09:30.271 --> 09:47.458
And my thinking about independent research libraries a little different than the research libraries that were affiliated with the great universities, such as the Hoseley, the Firestone, whatever, is that we really have, I think, two different functions.

09:47.619 --> 09:56.633
One is a research club, scholarly function, where we are trying to be committed to serving scholars,

09:57.187 --> 09:59.552
we should always be committed to serving scholars.

09:59.572 --> 10:06.427
And the great challenge for all of us at this point is to put all this material online.

10:07.108 --> 10:07.449
Really?

10:07.589 --> 10:10.656
And so we have been

10:11.176 --> 10:13.560
We've developed a plan to do that.

10:13.620 --> 10:17.385
We've raised an enormous amount of money to do it.

10:17.405 --> 10:19.408
It is being done as we speak.

10:19.668 --> 10:20.670
Oh, no, you say all.

10:20.770 --> 10:21.631
You mean all.

10:21.651 --> 10:33.329
Every single object in the Morgan Library will have a short bibliographical description of this is... A bibliographical description?

10:33.349 --> 10:35.752
I thought you were talking about scanning the content.

10:35.792 --> 10:36.854
No, no, no, no.

10:37.154 --> 10:39.057
Just a short bibliographical description.

10:39.408 --> 10:41.793
description of every object.

10:41.814 --> 10:42.335
That makes sense.

10:43.257 --> 10:44.339
Well, absolutely.

10:45.282 --> 10:48.649
But this is something that we've not done before.

10:48.950 --> 10:55.084
If you ask my colleagues, have you catalogued the collection, they will of course say no.

10:55.706 --> 10:57.670
But their way of cataloguing the book

10:58.105 --> 11:06.920
and the Folger's way of cataloging the same book and the Houghton's way of cataloging that same book may be three entirely different things.

11:07.020 --> 11:21.784
Now there is general agreement about what a short bibliographical description of a book that printed in this 15th, 16th, 17th century and so on is going to be, and it's now possible to convert this material into this uniform

11:22.118 --> 11:28.688
And it's going to be a fantastic contribution to scholars all over the world.

11:28.929 --> 11:30.531
And when they'll be able to get this.

11:30.872 --> 11:32.574
When do you anticipate this will go online?

11:32.614 --> 11:40.186
Well, I was told the other day by a colleague of mine and my ass about this by the end of the year 2000, so it's only another year and a half.

11:40.206 --> 11:41.788
Do you have a website for this now?

11:41.849 --> 11:49.240
Do you already have a... We actually have a website for the bookshop, and Laura and a number of others are in the process of

11:49.220 --> 11:55.154
I'm creating a website for the library now, and I'm very committed to doing that.

11:55.194 --> 11:57.038
I want it done sooner rather than later.

11:57.058 --> 12:02.912
You may be able to, you know more about where you are, Laura, than I do.

12:02.932 --> 12:06.621
Yeah, we really need to have it up and moving in the spring.

12:07.107 --> 12:11.933
Well, I think it's at the latest when our next exhibition opens.

12:11.954 --> 12:24.350
But a group of us from different departments have formed a committee and, you know, can represent curatorial and information systems in itself.

12:24.370 --> 12:31.319
And we've been making things, we've done some mock pages in itself.

12:31.540 --> 12:36.186
And because we are, you know, again, a dual nature, trying to satisfy the dual nature of institutions.

12:36.740 --> 12:42.609
But anyway, it's a work in process.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.057
What's your position on, or what are your thoughts on?

12:48.799 --> 12:54.288
Scanning some apart, or all of the collections?

12:54.308 --> 12:59.136
As Mother Boyle had tripped down a little bit, and as LC is doing it.

12:59.690 --> 13:00.651
to a great extent.

13:01.492 --> 13:15.865
I'm very interested in doing that, but I felt that the first responsibility to just get this to produce a short bibliographical description of every single object that is here, then two other things can happen thereafter.

13:16.466 --> 13:26.355
The curatorial staff can then provide more scholarly descriptions of the same object as time and energy and money permits.

13:26.943 --> 13:44.800
And the other thing that could be done is that those parts of the collection that are worth scanning, I can ask the curators of those collections which parts, which books, which manuscripts you really think are, does it make sense to do this.

13:44.780 --> 13:54.394
what's your view about the current state of the technology of scanning, and come up with some sort of estimate as to what it's going to cost.

13:54.454 --> 14:10.196
Most people that I've talked to so far feel that there has been great progress made in the scanning and the digitalizing and so on of many of these manuscripts and books, but that the process is still evolving.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.299
It's still very much coming.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.200
So we really haven't

14:13.518 --> 14:16.161
lost anything by not doing this.

14:17.243 --> 14:28.997
And I'd be perfectly willing to let the big boys, the library found, Rose, the National Gallery, Washington, and London, and so on, figure this all out until the rest of us would swim along in their way.

14:29.318 --> 14:30.659
And it's not just a question of access.

14:30.679 --> 14:34.063
I mean, I was up at Cornell, and they're scanning books.

14:34.844 --> 14:37.728
But the process requires guillotining a book.

14:37.828 --> 14:41.753
I mean, you actually have to destroy an object in order to

14:42.509 --> 14:43.791
to make a digital copy of it.

14:43.831 --> 14:49.358
So clearly, what we're talking about in this instance, they also have machines now that they're developing.

14:49.539 --> 14:53.284
They have cradles, and they take into account.

14:53.304 --> 14:55.827
But that's why the Hinman collator is never perfect.

14:55.867 --> 15:02.497
You always see those little wavy, they were shooting these first folios that you really couldn't bend.

15:02.517 --> 15:05.040
So I would have to think that's what you're saying here, is just to

15:05.459 --> 15:07.142
maintaining the integrity of them.

15:07.422 --> 15:08.223
Absolutely.

15:08.263 --> 15:12.930
We have this country's greatest collection of medieval renaissance manuscripts.

15:13.812 --> 15:18.519
A very, very key percentage of it is in Sicily.

15:18.539 --> 15:23.807
Most of them are therefore encoded and are bound.

15:24.348 --> 15:31.939
And one of the great contributions that the Pope Father made to the study of that subject earlier on were in fact to take

15:32.189 --> 15:38.299
photographs of every single miniature and every single one of those manuscripts.

15:38.319 --> 15:45.131
Those photographs are bound and available in black blinders and in the reading room.

15:45.151 --> 15:46.093
But they are all fading.

15:46.714 --> 15:50.260
This is now photographs were taken of how much of the collection?

15:50.580 --> 15:55.088
Well, this was every single illuminated manuscript.

15:55.108 --> 15:56.290
Every illuminated manuscript.

15:56.742 --> 16:07.155
twelve or thirteen hundred of those, but each one of those manuscripts had many, many miniatures, and they were very painstakingly photographed over time.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.178
The photographs were then put in binders, and the binders are in the reading room.

16:10.198 --> 16:18.008
That's all fine, but it now looks like the most incredibly antiquated and obsolete form of

16:18.747 --> 16:30.358
replicating these objects, whereas obviously with digitalizing the scanning process now, we would be able to detect enough of these, produce much higher quality.

16:30.378 --> 16:34.602
And I think the real question is going to be, how long will these things last?

16:34.622 --> 16:37.285
How long will the digital tape last?

16:37.305 --> 16:43.050
And there's some indication that they last from four to six years, and then they tend to... That's exactly right.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.071
I'm writing about this.

16:44.091 --> 16:46.654
Okay, and you know a great deal more than I do about this.

16:46.674 --> 16:47.995
That's just one of the reasons I'm just

16:48.565 --> 16:54.432
You talk about Gilgamesh is from stone tablets, which lasts forever.

16:55.433 --> 17:00.158
But they have Viking material from the space probes.

17:00.238 --> 17:01.399
It's already useless.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.663
Millions and millions of dollars of data that came back from space.

17:04.703 --> 17:06.085
You can't access it now.

17:06.265 --> 17:07.366
You have machines that can read it.

17:07.626 --> 17:11.110
It's on magnetic tape that's unusable.

17:11.451 --> 17:13.493
And the technology is wonderful.

17:14.013 --> 17:17.618
But the longevity is major.

17:18.118 --> 17:21.823
And as you say, four to six years, if it's at zeros and ones, that's fine.

17:21.843 --> 17:30.574
But somebody has to be able to switch to the phrase, the word they use is migration, to migrate the data from one format to another.

17:30.694 --> 17:31.795
That's right.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.380
Now, these photographs, were they shot as a

17:35.782 --> 17:36.944
What was the purpose of that?

17:36.964 --> 17:43.117
I mean, to have a documentary record of what you have outside of the... It was probably to have a documentary record.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.361
It was partly to try to persuade a number of scholars.

17:45.441 --> 17:46.984
It was partly for a combination.

17:47.625 --> 17:55.461
To preserve, in other words, to see if it were possible to persuade a number of scholars who were really studying the iconography

17:55.441 --> 18:02.702
of many of these images, to look at a photograph of it, rather than to have to bring the manuscript down and open up it.

18:02.722 --> 18:03.464
And what did you find?

18:03.484 --> 18:07.155
Oh, it was a tremendous resource.

18:07.591 --> 18:11.856
scholars of these manuscripts were enormously grateful.

18:11.917 --> 18:12.197
They were.

18:12.297 --> 18:21.168
So they were willing to read the copy as opposed to the... Well, it obviously depended very much on the kind of work that they were doing.

18:21.189 --> 18:33.244
But for those, for example, who were primarily interested in studying the miniature as if it were a work of art and studied the iconography, and they didn't particularly have to see the

18:33.224 --> 18:38.233
They didn't have to see the binding, and they weren't particularly interested in the text and all the rest of it.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.577
This served reasonably well.

18:40.757 --> 18:49.412
On the other hand, when they made it clear that they really did need to see the thing itself, and we would provide the thing itself under the reason.

18:49.993 --> 18:53.038
This is one of the questions that I'm asking repeatedly.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.161
to scholars.

18:54.281 --> 18:57.105
Are you satisfied with a thanks simile?

18:57.125 --> 18:59.288
Or do you really feel that you have to have the original?

18:59.728 --> 19:02.732
And nine times out of ten, they really want the original.

19:02.752 --> 19:03.873
Absolutely, they want the original.

19:04.094 --> 19:08.099
And it's for reasons beyond just looking at it.

19:08.119 --> 19:11.003
I mean, there's something almost spiritual.

19:11.263 --> 19:12.945
Yeah, absolutely.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.387
They want to see the thing itself.

19:14.547 --> 19:15.048
Exactly.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.093
So tell me a little bit about your plans for

19:19.310 --> 19:20.352
The 75th year?

19:20.492 --> 19:24.679
This is quite an exciting year for the Morgan, isn't it?

19:25.060 --> 19:26.482
Well, it is.

19:28.085 --> 19:34.416
It's the 75th year of the library as a public institution, and for many people.

19:34.852 --> 19:47.529
It still seems as if it is a private institution that one of them that I've been trying to do with Gloria's help and others in the last ten or twelve years is to dramatize me that we exist.

19:47.549 --> 19:51.454
Because there were a great many people who were born and raised in New York and never been in the lobby library.

19:52.595 --> 19:54.598
Ask me a cop on the street where it is.

19:55.557 --> 19:56.038
Precisely.

19:57.119 --> 20:07.831
And the library should assume as much responsibility for that as anything else because there was a real emphasis earlier on keeping a very, very low profile.

20:08.251 --> 20:16.000
My view here is that we are a public institution here to serve the museum going public and we are to serve scholars.

20:16.020 --> 20:21.526
And therefore we've got to set ourselves up as best we can to do those two things.

20:21.546 --> 20:23.488
And we've also got to advertise

20:23.907 --> 20:49.493
the fact that we are here and that we are a public institution and the creation of this cafe out here and the building in this atrium was actually a great help because a lot of people I think that a lot of people could have a cup of tea or coffee or have a meal here then it is a public institution and it's brought a lot of people in I think some of them only come to have a meal but some of them then

20:50.080 --> 20:50.642
fill out.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.948
It makes a statement, doesn't it?

20:53.008 --> 20:54.232
You're really inviting people in.

20:54.312 --> 20:55.154
Yeah.

20:55.175 --> 20:56.879
And that's a very concrete way to do it.

20:57.140 --> 21:00.951
And I think that that really has helped in certainly the efforts to

21:02.045 --> 21:15.764
to get reviews, to advertise our presence on WQXR, or when we have modest sums of money for in-print advertising and so on, to produce.

21:15.784 --> 21:19.268
We have a much more complicated, aggressive exhibition schedule.

21:19.288 --> 21:22.753
It just gets, I think most people would say that within the last ten years,

21:23.122 --> 21:28.872
the profile of the library as a public institution has, in fact, raised, been raised.

21:29.293 --> 21:31.837
I mean, it may have gone from, you know, here to here.

21:31.857 --> 21:35.043
I think there's a whole quadruple equal.

21:35.063 --> 21:47.425
As a practical matter, when you, being a public institution at this level, what exactly, you certainly don't want to invite the public to come in and to be readers.

21:47.776 --> 21:50.659
No, on the scholarly side, no.

21:50.979 --> 22:01.751
I mean, what we want there is, in fact, anybody and everybody who has a solid, substantial scholarly reason for being here.

22:01.771 --> 22:17.108
But in terms of the library as a museum, I would like more people to know where we are, to know where the collections are, and to have a reason to come here to see both the special exhibitions, but also objects from our own collections.

22:17.527 --> 22:20.956
Do people turn out to see book exhibitions, just out of curiosity?

22:20.976 --> 22:22.710
It's a question I've never asked.

22:22.943 --> 22:29.412
much less the drawings and paintings.

22:29.432 --> 22:44.571
And, in fact, as we just jump in, I think that this exhibition, we were curious to see how much more of the awards we might get, but in comparison to some other kinds of marketing that we were able to do, and, you know, just also the reputation of the quality of this collection.

22:44.591 --> 22:46.013
And the name, of course.

22:46.033 --> 22:49.558
Yeah, and then it hasn't been seen, so we would expect to draw more than

22:49.741 --> 22:53.295
I'd love to get the figures on this.

22:53.596 --> 22:56.186
I really am interested in people who are interested in books.

22:57.069 --> 22:59.278
I never thought that you could measure it in terms of

22:59.545 --> 23:03.491
people who come to an exhibition, but why not?

23:03.992 --> 23:04.793
I don't honestly know.

23:04.934 --> 23:08.599
I have all the curiosity that Gloria has to see.

23:08.619 --> 23:24.625
Obviously, the Getty name is going to be an attraction, but I'll be interested to see how much of an attraction it is, because I think particularly without all the fanfare surrounding the Getty Museum of a couple of years ago, I'm not so sure how

23:24.605 --> 23:31.253
conscious Americans are, average Americans are, of the Gettys, other than a lot of gasoline and oil.

23:31.694 --> 23:40.264
Whereas in England, Paul Getty is a major force, because he's been a major philanthropist, and he's, as you say, made the works of art.

23:40.344 --> 23:43.248
Just do Alexis, as I did, a Lexus search of him.

23:43.488 --> 23:52.519
When I was up at Hereford Cathedral last year, I don't know if you've been up there, the chain book, that building there, he built that.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.422
showed my wife when I arrived.

23:54.623 --> 23:55.865
He's ours now.

23:56.606 --> 23:57.789
He's ours.

23:59.472 --> 24:04.281
And he didn't come for the dedication for that, so I would have been surprised had he come for this.

24:04.301 --> 24:09.410
Well, I don't want to take up too much of Mr. Pierce's time.

24:09.471 --> 24:10.392
I certainly thank you for it.

24:10.412 --> 24:10.873
I'm sorry.

24:10.913 --> 24:13.598
No, I'm glad you've seen you.

24:13.678 --> 24:15.081
I wish you well, and thank you.

24:15.297 --> 24:18.260
These quotes will be very useful.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.582
This will be the April piece, by the way.

24:20.683 --> 24:21.984
Oh, good.

24:22.825 --> 24:23.766
It's the next one I'm writing.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.109
What will you be showing in April?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.391
Oh, that's great.

24:29.592 --> 24:31.273
That's terrific.

24:31.333 --> 24:34.337
That's great from our point of view.

24:34.397 --> 24:37.400
Actually, it comes out at the end of March.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.702
I'll be writing this for the next two weeks.

24:39.850 --> 24:47.461
But then you can give me a good list of what's forthcoming through the end of the year, or I'll be happy to get that in as well.

24:47.742 --> 24:55.193
Yeah, we have a Washington exhibition right now in Huntington.

24:55.753 --> 24:56.895
That's in September.

24:56.975 --> 25:05.988
In the spring we have a drawing, the Major Browning Show, and then the George Washington Show, which opened at the Huntington Inn.

25:06.008 --> 25:07.551
Oh, that's in Huntington.

25:07.631 --> 25:07.731
Yeah.

25:08.403 --> 25:34.343
all right so we're going to go take a look at you have a card that i could use because i'll be quoting it oh yes well i felt wonderful excellent i've been in your facility a number of times and john i've interviewed john a couple of times and ed and this is quite a uh

25:34.981 --> 25:37.645
Quite an exciting development for the Borgen Library.

25:37.665 --> 25:39.527
They're very thrilled to have this.

25:40.168 --> 25:44.955
This is a first, isn't it, for Sir Paul to agree?

25:44.975 --> 25:46.457
It's the first major exhibition.

25:46.557 --> 25:53.286
Individual items have been lent to in various places around the world, but not anything more than that so far.

25:53.306 --> 25:58.453
What was his thinking on this, to allow this to come here, do you think?

25:58.674 --> 26:04.161
It is quite a... It's quite a wrench, because when one does these things, you don't really think...

26:04.715 --> 26:28.967
the fact that um the exhibition runs from january to speaking in may it doesn't sound too bad but actually when you lose your stuff in november and you don't get it back to the middle of the summer it gets a bit worse doesn't it so if you're in a rush why don't you just give me a little bit of a overview of did you have any specific questions you want to get over well i i've read the catalog so i'm just

26:29.082 --> 26:35.029
Maybe you could give me a sense of how representative this is of the entire collection.

26:35.049 --> 26:45.842
Well, it's not like a cross-section of the library, because it's largely that, but it's leavened with sort of personal favourites, which sort of give us a tilt away from the whole effect, I think.

26:47.684 --> 26:57.756
But essentially we try to include a little bit of everything, which is really... It's bindings, it's illumination, calligraphy, typography.

26:57.905 --> 27:00.308
and the colourful books, really.

27:00.368 --> 27:06.735
So he tries to suggest the whole art of the book theme from the Middle Ages right through to the modern.

27:07.656 --> 27:09.879
And that is essentially the theme of the larger collection?

27:09.899 --> 27:11.321
Yes, it's come to become that.

27:11.341 --> 27:14.124
It never was that recently, I don't think.

27:14.144 --> 27:17.528
I didn't know that it was anything other than books being bought.

27:18.469 --> 27:22.073
And eventually it becomes more than it was, doesn't it, the collection?

27:22.353 --> 27:22.954
Sure, of course.

27:22.994 --> 27:24.756
And you suddenly find yourself with a...

27:26.457 --> 27:27.799
Why don't you tell me what this is?

27:27.819 --> 27:29.701
This is an after-text model for the library.

27:30.402 --> 27:32.145
It's not exactly anything.

27:32.165 --> 27:37.793
This was done at the sort of planning stage, but it essentially shows you the interiors as they are.

27:40.717 --> 27:42.459
And do you have readers come here?

27:43.060 --> 27:49.849
Scholars can visit to see specific items, and book collecting groups can visit.

27:50.116 --> 27:56.368
bookbinders societies and things that come on little tours and so on, and we put up an exhibition very much like this in the back.

27:56.448 --> 27:59.514
This largely reproduces what you would see in the library.

27:59.654 --> 27:59.895
Really?

27:59.935 --> 28:02.219
So there is an exhibition?

28:02.260 --> 28:08.732
An exhibition will be put out by Brian Maggs for the occasion, which can be slanted towards whoever's coming.

28:09.337 --> 28:11.039
But Brian is the librarian.

28:11.160 --> 28:17.388
I'm fascinated by that because I'll be writing about scholar booksellers.

28:17.668 --> 28:20.412
It's a new book that I'm working on.

28:20.713 --> 28:21.233
That's a chapter.

28:21.474 --> 28:29.024
I love the fact that you would go to a bookseller to be a librarian.

28:29.044 --> 28:31.868
A collector of this magnitude would

28:32.219 --> 28:41.553
Well, I mean, that again is something that develops over the years, and that's eventually, I mean, you know, one knows the books backwards, so who better to do it, really, I suppose.

28:41.834 --> 28:49.165
Who knows the books, but also, I think, knows what the individual wants, that you have a...

28:49.246 --> 28:51.408
Well, we've all grown up with the collection as it's developed.

28:51.549 --> 28:52.690
Is that right?

28:53.291 --> 28:55.713
So you've been there more or less from the beginning?

28:55.733 --> 28:56.714
Well, I've known it from the beginning.

28:56.794 --> 28:59.337
I've known it for 20 years, which is as long as I've been doing it.

28:59.518 --> 29:04.323
When, essentially, would you say the collection began, as we know it?

29:04.343 --> 29:05.024
In the early 70s.

29:05.304 --> 29:13.313
It was just too late for the Abbey sales, which is, I think, one of his regrets, because many of them, plus John Rowland Abbey, who was a great finding collector.

29:13.428 --> 29:16.112
many of the books in the library came with this collection.

29:16.312 --> 29:17.855
A-B-E-Y?

29:17.875 --> 29:18.876
A-W-E-Y.

29:18.897 --> 29:19.197
E-Y.

29:19.217 --> 29:26.328
Yeah, there was a whole series of sales in the late 60s, which Paul just missed, I think, but picked up many of the items later in the trade.

29:26.348 --> 29:33.479
And that's what really started him off on the sort of fine books, I think, was the dispersal of that collection.

29:33.499 --> 29:34.641
One of the great opportunities.

29:35.222 --> 29:39.148
Would you say that this, I mean, how many collections like this

29:39.989 --> 29:43.355
will a person be able to form?

29:43.595 --> 29:48.544
I mean, this undoubtedly is certainly one of the great collections of the late 20th century.

29:48.564 --> 29:56.798
Yes, it certainly is, and a great amount of work has gone into it from all sides, really, including the collector's thought.

29:58.200 --> 30:02.908
I don't know, one of the encouraging things is when you look at the acquisition dates of the books, how many of them are very recent?

30:03.125 --> 30:05.208
purchases the last 10 years or so.

30:05.228 --> 30:08.472
So I think there's hope for future collectors and I think this proves it really.

30:08.633 --> 30:12.318
Well the material of this caliber can still be had.

30:13.619 --> 30:14.941
Just look at the Caxton out there.

30:14.961 --> 30:15.742
Yes, you wouldn't believe it.

30:15.762 --> 30:23.012
You see, you could wait a lifetime and never get a chance to buy that, but luck and various other circumstances bring it forward.

30:23.433 --> 30:25.656
So you have to grasp the opportunity when it's presented.

30:26.277 --> 30:31.883
Anything at the top of his wish list that you care to share?

30:34.085 --> 30:35.727
There are various holes that one might like.

30:35.747 --> 30:39.290
I mean, the Romanesque binding, for example, would be something we would need one day.

30:40.552 --> 30:43.475
One could never hope for a treasure binding like the Morgan has here.

30:43.655 --> 30:50.682
In fact, Mr. Pierce was jokingly telling me about the... I asked, how did you...

30:51.067 --> 30:53.351
managed to secure such a triumph.

30:53.411 --> 31:03.326
And he said, well, he was talking with Sir Paul, and he said, I was hoping, this was a joke, that maybe they were in desperate straits and they were willing to sell a few things from the collection.

31:03.346 --> 31:05.349
He said, no, I don't think so.

31:05.369 --> 31:08.754
Did you want to show me around a few things and just kind of talk a little bit?

31:08.954 --> 31:14.543
I know you certainly, I mean, I'll be certainly free to look at the entire collection of my own, but maybe you could just point out a few

31:15.147 --> 31:40.446
uh items that that appeal particularly to you how many items do we have here i think 102 or something some such i mean i can't i mean i have my personal biases but that's sort of not really relevant to suppose ideas we all have our favorites i think it's one of the most extraordinary things which have been together as a group what do we call them again wooden bindings

31:40.645 --> 32:02.248
How many items are there in the Wooten?

32:02.515 --> 32:12.811
Obviously there are many other bindings for him around the world, but this is a very substantial tax group of them.

32:12.851 --> 32:15.415
What is it that attracts a person to bindings?

32:15.435 --> 32:21.604
When we think about books, when you think about the text, but are the texts relevant to the bindings in your view?

32:21.624 --> 32:22.746
Well, they can be.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.008
I mean, that certainly is the case.

32:24.028 --> 32:26.852
I mean, obviously many books and bindings tend to be Bibles and prayer books.

32:27.457 --> 32:30.920
but to get something like a utopia at a time by it is a real treasure.

32:30.940 --> 32:33.283
And that is a contemporary binding, right?

32:33.303 --> 32:37.026
Yeah, it's pretty much as the use of stars.

32:37.166 --> 32:37.307
Wow.

32:37.387 --> 32:39.469
It should, shouldn't it?

32:39.489 --> 32:45.755
Maybe you should use your influence.

32:46.155 --> 32:51.520
This is a binding from Yorkshire in the 12th century.

32:51.540 --> 32:52.621
Look at the condition of that.

32:52.681 --> 32:56.485
And the thing that amazes me is that you can actually have something as well.

32:56.735 --> 32:58.938
as good as this, if you look at the back cover.

33:00.340 --> 33:03.345
It's still got this deerskin dust wrapper on it.

33:03.865 --> 33:06.930
This thing put over the covers with its hair still there.

33:06.950 --> 33:17.786
It's incredible when you can visit Byland Abbey in Yorkshire, you can stand in this ruin to be able to sort of have something because it's like this original condition, like the day it was done virtually.

33:17.806 --> 33:18.767
How do you explain that?

33:18.807 --> 33:22.793
How is it that a book that one would think would be more fragile certainly than The Stones?

33:23.060 --> 33:25.703
How is it that books managed to survive?

33:25.723 --> 33:27.644
Books seem to be very indestructible in many ways.

33:27.725 --> 33:28.545
It's extraordinary.

33:28.986 --> 33:31.728
I mean, that hasn't been sitting on a shelf anywhere or anything.

33:31.748 --> 33:32.609
It's been kept.

33:33.210 --> 33:36.493
And it's been out there, and it was just recently acquired in 1997.

33:36.593 --> 33:38.775
It's been in America for the last hundred years, in fact.

33:39.296 --> 33:41.158
Where was it prior to...?

33:41.178 --> 33:45.021
The last public appearance was in the hoe sale in about 1910.

33:45.061 --> 33:46.142
Oh, so that was a hoe copy?

33:46.222 --> 33:46.363
Yeah.

33:47.784 --> 33:48.505
Fantastic.

33:48.525 --> 33:48.925
Amazing.

33:49.265 --> 33:50.907
I had no idea that the...

33:51.038 --> 33:54.685
It's just really marvellous.

33:55.306 --> 33:57.369
So what do you feel when you handle a book like that?

33:57.850 --> 33:59.613
It's just a huge privilege.

33:59.633 --> 34:01.537
I can't believe it.

34:01.557 --> 34:06.045
It's the sort of thing you expect to find in the Morgan Library, for example.

34:06.846 --> 34:08.489
Or the Bodleian or something out there.

34:08.509 --> 34:09.732
I'm not going to find the collection.

34:09.752 --> 34:15.021
It's just such an excitement.

34:15.760 --> 34:18.543
What else is good?

34:18.563 --> 34:20.144
One of only three copies.

34:20.164 --> 34:23.567
This is the first book illustrated with copper engravings.

34:23.727 --> 34:25.649
Boccaccio, catalogue 15.

34:26.610 --> 34:31.975
This is a print by Collard Manchin who was the... I mean this is a nice thing, but it fits together.

34:31.995 --> 34:37.400
He learnt printing together with Caxon and Bruges before Caxon came to London.

34:38.341 --> 34:39.902
So it fits very well with the Chaucer.

34:39.942 --> 34:45.447
But it's just another coincidence when things start to fit together in a collection like this after it's been going for a long time.

34:45.967 --> 34:47.368
Look at the condition.

34:47.689 --> 34:49.811
The paper is so crisp.

34:49.831 --> 34:53.615
And the data on this is, I'm looking for 1476.

34:54.115 --> 34:56.057
This manuscript is so good.

34:56.237 --> 35:01.342
This is the breviary of Bernard Haino, which is number 13 in the catalog.

35:01.362 --> 35:02.143
This is so fantastic.

35:02.163 --> 35:02.644
When H.P.

35:02.664 --> 35:07.529
Krauss showed it to the previous Morgan librarian, Belle de Costa Greene, she told him it was forgery.

35:08.169 --> 35:08.570
Come on.

35:09.090 --> 35:10.672
It's written up in Krauss's memoirs.

35:10.952 --> 35:11.893
It's one of the few stories.

35:11.913 --> 35:13.414
So she passed on this?

35:13.434 --> 35:13.555
Yeah.

35:13.575 --> 35:14.796
She had an opportunity to buy this.

35:15.036 --> 35:15.957
Young man, you have a

35:16.190 --> 35:23.159
An example of the work of a Spanish forger, she said, which rather shook him because it was one of his first purchases in New York.

35:23.179 --> 35:24.500
So Bill Glean passed on this.

35:24.580 --> 35:24.781
Yeah.

35:25.481 --> 35:27.384
So here it is, you see, it's rather a nice touch.

35:29.787 --> 35:31.309
It's probably the first time it's been here since.

35:32.250 --> 35:32.951
That's a great story.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.774
How could you possibly think something like that as a forgery?

35:35.954 --> 35:38.718
It's still perfect, right?

35:38.738 --> 35:40.560
It's wonderful.

35:44.523 --> 35:47.147
This is a 1462 Minds Bible.

35:47.468 --> 35:48.309
It's number 12.

35:49.511 --> 35:51.814
Wonderful.

35:51.834 --> 35:56.321
It's number 2.

35:57.583 --> 36:01.910
Sold off by the Toronto Brown Library, yes.

36:01.930 --> 36:09.442
Now this is an interest, this is a rather... Well, this whole section here actually is rather interesting because this represents the supposants from American institutional libraries.

36:09.502 --> 36:10.804
Come on now.

36:11.465 --> 36:12.066
Five items.

36:12.282 --> 36:14.205
No, no, three here.

36:14.225 --> 36:15.747
You've got the Doheny Library.

36:16.468 --> 36:18.752
That's item number four.

36:18.772 --> 36:19.232
Four.

36:19.553 --> 36:19.913
Okay.

36:20.354 --> 36:22.958
Number one here is the Folger Shakespeare Library.

36:23.879 --> 36:25.862
Folger discarded that?

36:25.882 --> 36:26.483
Yeah.

36:26.503 --> 36:28.967
Very northly, they discarded them.

36:28.987 --> 36:34.114
This was a bookbinding that they discovered on their shelves on a 16th century English book.

36:34.835 --> 36:38.861
And they took it off and sold them leaf.

36:38.942 --> 36:39.943
1989.

36:40.430 --> 36:42.637
And what's the estimated date on that?

36:42.918 --> 36:45.064
It's 7th century.

36:45.084 --> 36:47.130
It's possibly one of the earliest English manuscripts.

36:47.732 --> 36:48.314
And the folder?

36:48.675 --> 36:50.320
Disposed of it.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.667
This was disposed of by the John Carter Brown Library.

36:53.930 --> 36:56.294
Of course they had reasons for doing it.

36:56.395 --> 36:57.477
Of course they did.

36:57.497 --> 36:58.058
What could they be?

36:58.318 --> 37:03.127
Well, the Carter Brown Library wanted to focus on Americana, which is their main thing.

37:03.147 --> 37:05.251
Of course, this is not Americana.

37:05.271 --> 37:06.614
It's a German luxury manuscript.

37:06.634 --> 37:08.096
It's a German luxury manuscript.

37:08.116 --> 37:10.100
So, therefore... So, how did they acquire it?

37:10.120 --> 37:12.124
Why did they acquire it in the first place?

37:12.264 --> 37:13.426
It was a gift.

37:13.446 --> 37:13.987
It was a gift.

37:14.007 --> 37:17.153
It was a gift?

37:18.449 --> 37:20.231
Where it is?

37:20.271 --> 37:21.832
Camarillo, isn't it?

37:22.373 --> 37:22.613
Yes.

37:22.813 --> 37:30.180
They were given the entire collection, and then they decided that that was not their thing, so they sold off the collections to raise money.

37:30.480 --> 37:34.263
But what amazes me is that these are items one, two, and four in the catalogue.

37:34.323 --> 37:36.826
We are making a statement here, aren't we?

37:36.846 --> 37:45.874
Well, it is amazing in one way or another, because most of the great items are in private collections or in public domain, so the only way something is going to be released

37:46.276 --> 37:48.285
is if something like this happens.

37:48.888 --> 37:51.018
And Morgan, of course, had the same problem, too.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.936
By the time he started collecting, though it was

37:55.186 --> 38:03.557
around 1900, most of the major manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, the Lindisfying Gospels, all these things, they were already in the public domain.

38:03.598 --> 38:12.890
So the only way that you're going to get major pieces is if some institution changes its focus and then decides to sell.

38:13.171 --> 38:16.015
But they weren't discarding it because they thought it was worthless.

38:16.035 --> 38:19.019
Well, quite contrary, I mean.

38:19.039 --> 38:22.223
Indeed, they got rid of it for the other reasons, because the things have become

38:22.490 --> 38:28.697
so valuable that they felt that these assets could be what were their own interests.

38:28.717 --> 38:37.746
The suggestion that once an item goes into an institutional library that it's gone forever is not really true, is it?

38:38.187 --> 38:41.670
We've even had a Morgan duplicate sale, haven't we?

38:41.690 --> 38:43.813
Yeah, with the printed books and the Sotheby's sale.

38:43.973 --> 38:44.493
When was that?

38:45.515 --> 38:47.877
There have been several different sales.

38:47.897 --> 38:50.640
This was a couple dozen years ago.

38:51.059 --> 38:53.303
In the 70s there was no.

38:53.383 --> 38:54.104
Printed books.

38:54.144 --> 38:56.008
They were duplicate printed books.

38:57.350 --> 38:58.552
And that is great for collectors.

38:58.792 --> 38:59.113
It is.

38:59.854 --> 39:01.797
Certainly the provenance is wonderful.

39:02.018 --> 39:09.671
You have to say that if a book is good enough for these places, the news certainly is good enough for oneself, isn't it?

39:10.012 --> 39:10.873
That's a great quote.

39:11.090 --> 39:29.961
How did you choose which items that you would include?

39:30.141 --> 39:34.448
Or did Sir Paul make the decision, make the selection?

39:34.850 --> 39:44.801
It was his selection, which I think was perhaps refined by a process of give and take, partly quality questions, but also really space.

39:45.142 --> 39:48.005
It was quite a difficult process.

39:48.485 --> 39:49.306
Space here, you mean?

39:49.406 --> 39:49.747
Oh, yes.

39:49.807 --> 39:58.397
Well, I mean, you see the room is packed, and there are only about 100 items, and there are many more that could have been included, but worth it.

39:58.417 --> 40:01.380
How do you judge this exhibition?

40:01.833 --> 40:06.761
as comparing it to others that you've had here at the Morgan.

40:06.781 --> 40:17.597
I'm not meaning to disparage any of the other ones, but this is quite a triumph for the Morgan to be getting the first public viewing of examples from this library.

40:18.299 --> 40:18.639
Oh, yes?

40:19.821 --> 40:22.024
Well, it's very rare that we have exhibitions like this.

40:22.084 --> 40:24.829
If you'd identify yourself with the tapes... Oh, sorry, Roger Wick.

40:25.790 --> 40:30.237
It's very unusual that we have an exhibition of books and manuscripts that belong completely to somebody else.

40:30.706 --> 40:32.849
That is, first of all, very unusual.

40:32.869 --> 40:46.448
So it was quite a coup that we were able to secure this show, because normally, of course, our exhibitions might include loans from other institutions or other people, but usually they're in the context of more of the material, supporting what is already here.

40:48.711 --> 40:50.774
So this is actually extremely unusual.

40:50.834 --> 40:52.597
Has it happened before?

40:52.637 --> 40:59.987
Can you think of any other individual collections that have been... We had the exhibition from the Bernard Breslauer collection of single leaves here.

41:00.406 --> 41:08.259
That was also, like this, an extremely unusual example, but it was a very fine collection that we wanted to show.

41:08.279 --> 41:10.603
And there were also institutional collections.

41:10.663 --> 41:13.467
Oh, this is William Boakley.

41:14.609 --> 41:16.172
We've had photos from Eton College.

41:16.212 --> 41:25.587
We've had certainly a number of exhibitions relating to institutions, and I think there have been private collections of drawings that have been shown.

41:26.123 --> 41:39.459
But one thing we might say, and Lou Ashby, one thing we might say is that when we decide on an exhibition, we are very interested in showing things which are related to the Morgan collections themselves.

41:40.080 --> 41:50.433
And one of the wonders of the Getty collection, in its beauty and its selectivity, is that in many ways it mirrors the kind of collecting that Pierpont Morgan was doing himself.

41:51.033 --> 41:55.759
And that in showing these things, we're showing the kinds of things which have helped to

41:56.279 --> 41:59.782
serve as the basis for this institution's collective.

41:59.802 --> 42:04.447
And we do these things as a public service, because obviously not the thousands of people that will come to the show.

42:04.807 --> 42:12.035
Those people, A, probably can't all go over across the ocean on an airplane and then tromp through the Wormsley Library.

42:12.095 --> 42:12.795
So I tried.

42:13.036 --> 42:13.896
They wouldn't let me.

42:13.916 --> 42:15.498
I couldn't get in.

42:15.518 --> 42:16.539
Even one person.

42:16.559 --> 42:19.001
So this is a way of sharing this collection.

42:19.082 --> 42:22.485
So we're performing our kind of public service by housing this collection.

42:22.525 --> 42:22.905
I would say so.

42:22.945 --> 42:25.628
Temporarily so it can be shared with the public.

42:26.266 --> 42:28.788
That's one aspect of it that's supposed to be enough.

42:28.808 --> 42:37.036
Would you think, if we're talking about a private collective, would you look at this library that's put together in, what did you say, about 20 years?

42:37.056 --> 42:38.137
30 years.

42:38.657 --> 42:43.762
At this point in the 20th century, do you stand in awe of that?

42:43.802 --> 42:51.608
Maybe I'm asking for too much of a characterization, but it is quite an achievement, I think, for an individual to put together a library.

42:51.909 --> 42:55.632
Yes, and I think also, considering the range, I think that's what

42:56.000 --> 43:12.951
is appealing in what may distinguish from other such exhibitions that we have had, that here we really have the whole range, as Andrew said, that reflects our own collecting interest that starts with the manuscript tradition and goes right up to the 20th century, not only including books for their content, but also the bindings.

43:13.071 --> 43:20.404
It's really put together a collection of book bindings, so it really is an overview of the history of the book.

43:20.722 --> 43:23.125
And every object is beautiful.

43:23.185 --> 43:28.270
I mean, every piece that you see in the exhibition is stellar and stellar and beautiful in addition.

43:28.290 --> 43:31.554
So it's not only a wonderful range, but every example is beautifully preserved.

43:31.754 --> 43:43.106
So these are books which are ostensibly meant to be read, but this is a museum exhibition, and this certainly would qualify as a kind of museum exhibition, right?

43:43.126 --> 43:44.047
Of beautiful objects.

43:44.247 --> 43:46.610
Oh, yeah.

43:46.650 --> 43:48.972
Everything here is of that.

43:49.593 --> 43:49.733
Mm-hmm.

43:50.911 --> 43:57.062
We're interested not only in the intellectual content of the items, but their physical characteristics as well.

43:57.082 --> 43:58.745
It's the Booker's Objects.

43:58.986 --> 44:02.793
I think it's probably the unifying theme of the collection as it's evolved.

44:05.337 --> 44:06.399
It's the whole thing.

44:07.140 --> 44:10.086
How large would you say his library, Sir Paul's library is now?

44:10.106 --> 44:11.148
How many items?

44:11.168 --> 44:11.568
Approximately?

44:11.588 --> 44:12.370
Seven or eight thousand.

44:12.390 --> 44:13.893
Seven or eight thousand.

44:13.913 --> 44:14.674
Which is not many.

44:15.177 --> 44:18.143
in terms of Ho, who perhaps had 100,000.

44:18.664 --> 44:20.206
Certainly Heber had 100,000.

44:20.747 --> 44:21.409
Heber had 100,000.

44:21.429 --> 44:29.524
I don't think Ho's was that large, but he had a jump start on everybody else.

44:29.622 --> 44:31.584
He had two Gutenberg rivals, didn't he?

44:31.664 --> 44:34.748
One on Vellum and one on... Yes.

44:34.768 --> 44:40.294
Yes, we haven't got to that yet, I'm afraid.

44:40.314 --> 44:42.777
Well, how many are there that are in private hands?

44:42.797 --> 44:46.721
I mean, the Scheide copy, which is at Princeton, and that's about it, I think.

44:46.741 --> 44:49.925
Maybe there's one in Germany, I guess.

44:49.945 --> 44:52.508
I think the German ones are in the public collections, also.

44:52.528 --> 44:55.191
I mean, if you count both and utilize the public collections.

44:55.643 --> 44:56.104
You do.

44:56.184 --> 44:57.185
I think you actually would.

44:59.989 --> 45:00.109
Right.

45:00.129 --> 45:02.212
I think there are institutions, but that's not in front of us.

45:02.232 --> 45:02.913
There might be one.

45:03.053 --> 45:03.634
There might be one.

45:04.475 --> 45:04.916
I don't know.

45:05.777 --> 45:11.024
Does anyone have anything they feel I should know for this article that I'm writing?

45:11.425 --> 45:14.229
Any observations that might be particularly useful?

45:14.549 --> 45:22.360
I'm doing an article for the Morgan Library on its 75th, and also, as it happened, I'll be discussing this

45:22.694 --> 45:30.342
exhibition and the Wolfenbeutel at the Globe, that you would have these two exhibitions going on in one city.

45:30.382 --> 45:31.123
Which is nice.

45:31.163 --> 45:32.464
It's pretty nice.

45:32.484 --> 45:33.285
Yes, it is.

45:33.486 --> 45:35.287
And at firsts, too.

45:35.308 --> 45:37.650
I mean, I don't think that that... Well, it's too fast, isn't it?

45:37.770 --> 45:39.232
Yeah, it really is.

45:39.252 --> 45:41.334
It's kind of nice.

45:41.354 --> 45:52.566
I think people will be surprised at what somebody like Mr. Genndy, in his case, has been able to acquire in a relatively short period, that works of this quality are even still available.

45:52.799 --> 45:56.082
If you concentrate on what you're doing, you can still achieve it.

45:56.763 --> 46:02.750
And you have to, how do I phrase this, but it certainly requires more than means, doesn't it?

46:02.850 --> 46:03.130
Oh, certainly.

46:03.150 --> 46:04.692
You have to have the means to do it.

46:05.252 --> 46:06.774
More than the means.

46:06.794 --> 46:07.835
Well, let's start with the means.

46:08.095 --> 46:14.702
But, you know, all right, so let's assume that, fine, we understand that he has the means, but what does it require beyond that?

46:15.523 --> 46:18.907
Well, dedication, patience, and inspiration, I think, probably.

46:18.967 --> 46:21.169
And you combine those together over a long period of time.

46:22.145 --> 46:24.769
And you're probably too modest to say this, but good advice, too.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.071
Well, probably.

46:26.091 --> 46:33.363
Well, the knowledge or the wherewithal to know to where to go, to get that advice, to get it.

46:33.443 --> 46:43.599
I mean, anybody can go out and splurge all their money in Sotheby's and Christie's next week, but you're not going to achieve a collection that is going to sort of have a long-term sense in the way that this has.

46:44.019 --> 46:47.545
I mean, who has greater means than, I'm not asking for a comment, but, say, Bill Gates?

46:48.014 --> 46:55.646
You know, and they say he's creating these digital reproductions of great paintings.

46:56.467 --> 47:05.601
I asked Umberto Eco about that, and he said, isn't it interesting that the man who's doing that is the same man that spent 30 million, you know, outbid the Italian nation for the Leicester Codex.

47:05.621 --> 47:12.992
Isn't that encouraging for books, that actually somebody who will have digital photographs still wants, and is also the master of

47:13.124 --> 47:16.430
The computer thing actually wants to buy real books.

47:16.530 --> 47:18.413
And apparently he has been buying.

47:18.593 --> 47:20.116
I think that's a great encouragement.

47:20.136 --> 47:23.702
It's interesting, and it's certainly interesting, if anything.

47:25.304 --> 47:36.744
Well, I'd like to just kind of look around, and is there anything else that you think that would be particularly pertinent for me to walk away with?

47:36.944 --> 47:39.368
Well, I think that

47:39.500 --> 47:46.287
It made the evidence that he has a special predilection of things, English, and the reasons for that are clear.

47:46.587 --> 48:00.942
And this, too, aligns him really with Morgan, who was an anglophile and one of our greatest strengths in illuminated manuscripts and autographed manuscripts and printed books as English, you know, art.

48:01.763 --> 48:02.123
That is important.

48:02.143 --> 48:02.223
Yes.

48:02.243 --> 48:05.727
It's interesting things Italian was perhaps equally important, wasn't it?

48:06.415 --> 48:09.079
We're talking about Morgan now.

48:09.099 --> 48:10.842
Well, yes, but that was the building.

48:10.882 --> 48:15.108
But I think he was especially interested in English manuscript illumination.

48:16.550 --> 48:18.173
And I think that they were more favored.

48:18.193 --> 48:20.135
His Caxton's are another example.

48:20.155 --> 48:23.681
The Caxton's and certainly the Dickens Holdings, the Sir Walter Scott.

48:23.801 --> 48:24.542
I mean, that was...

48:24.910 --> 48:28.816
And, of course, he lived in England, so he had this real affinity.

48:28.916 --> 48:30.900
There were, what, 63 Caxtons here?

48:31.000 --> 48:32.182
Is that about right?

48:32.422 --> 48:33.504
I haven't counted recently.

48:33.524 --> 48:35.988
We acquired another one about him.

48:36.008 --> 48:36.709
Oh, you did?

48:36.729 --> 48:37.550
Yes.

48:37.570 --> 48:41.637
I just simply didn't want it to seem that Morgan's emphasis was

48:41.937 --> 48:51.509
only English because his European holdings are exceedingly strong, his Italian holdings are as well, but he shared that interest in English materials.

48:51.649 --> 48:58.598
I mean the French bindings, French bindings for example, certainly the best collection in England.

48:59.178 --> 49:05.786
I don't know about America, but certainly outside France and Europe is the best collection of them.

49:07.128 --> 49:08.670
Well, so there is a wider view

49:08.903 --> 49:09.444
here as well.

49:09.524 --> 49:12.467
One wouldn't like to say he was purely English, but there may be a slight favourite as well.

49:12.487 --> 49:24.102
No, I wouldn't say it was pure, but I think there is a special predilection, and Morgan also had that special predilection, but of course both of them collected over the large geographical land.

49:24.122 --> 49:26.004
How many Caxton's does Sir Paul have?

49:26.024 --> 49:27.006
Very well, but it's a good one.

49:27.126 --> 49:30.931
That's not bad.

49:30.951 --> 49:32.633
We've put it in a prominent position.

49:32.793 --> 49:35.176
I was enjoying it when I came in.

49:35.196 --> 49:36.818
It's quite exciting to

49:36.916 --> 49:43.265
We were discussing that wouldn't it be interesting if there was a mirror behind that Sir Thomas More back there so we could see the binding.

49:45.648 --> 49:50.355
Not this time around, unfortunately.

49:50.375 --> 49:53.840
But we're delighted that the front of space is so elegant.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.022
Anyone have any favorites?

49:57.606 --> 49:58.327
Pick two favorites.

49:58.627 --> 50:02.292
Oh, well, of course, I'm quite prejudiced.

50:02.312 --> 50:06.298
But one of my favorites clearly is the Otto Boyerian manuscript because it's

50:06.683 --> 50:07.784
And that's number two.

50:07.844 --> 50:13.031
One example of a true luxury manuscript, and actually some of the other pages are even more impressive.

50:13.451 --> 50:19.719
You can see them in a candlelight, where even the text pages are written in gold and purple vellum background.

50:19.799 --> 50:23.243
So this is really a magnificent piece in gold and silver.

50:23.583 --> 50:28.669
So it's a wonderful example of a monastic luxury manuscript.

50:28.709 --> 50:31.813
And of course, I'm especially attracted to it because I feel that it was

50:32.165 --> 50:54.898
seen by the artists who did a comparable luxury manuscript that we have in our own collections so i have other reasons attached to it because it links up you know with something our own interesting characterization of luxury monastic it's almost an oxymoron in a way yes but these things were regarded as you know part of the assets of the monastery and were kept in the treasury they were not kept on the monastic

50:55.199 --> 51:23.670
I just came back from Mount Athos in Greece and I did a piece for Smithsonian and it's exactly the real treasures are in the sacristy and the treasury and they have to vote the board has to vote that you can go in and see these things it was quite unusual to have that wonderful exhibition really yeah it was so you okay well thanks so much for the time and I'm glad we're able to you can give me a ring back in London I will thank you very much appreciate it

51:24.477 --> 51:27.862
Appreciate it.

51:29.425 --> 51:36.676
Thanks.

51:38.219 --> 51:51.480
Of course, to go completely modern, the romance connected with one of the very late manuscripts is the Keats, which has one of the most incredible book findings ever made.

51:56.692 --> 51:59.375
I thought that was a Kelmscott Chaucer as I was walking by.

51:59.395 --> 52:01.698
Yeah, this is the Sankorskine Sakhla Prusa.

52:01.838 --> 52:02.979
Absolutely amazing.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.602
And I will never forget this.

52:05.742 --> 52:06.463
This is 91.

52:06.703 --> 52:09.426
Yeah, and this is all beautifully illustrated.

52:09.446 --> 52:18.116
And I will never forget this, because I had to go through and be sure that the description which gave the total number of joules was correct.

52:18.377 --> 52:18.777
Come on!

52:19.338 --> 52:23.222
Yes, there are 1,027 joules, and being

52:23.472 --> 52:24.153
And you counted them?

52:24.273 --> 52:27.636
And I counted them to make sure that that description was... Did you get the talent sheet?

52:27.656 --> 52:28.037
I did.

52:28.197 --> 52:29.699
I sent so many of them.

52:29.739 --> 52:31.140
Did you itemize the various jewels?

52:31.160 --> 52:31.280
I did.

52:31.801 --> 52:33.022
And... Is this broken down?

52:33.182 --> 52:34.704
Yeah, it's in the catalog.

52:34.744 --> 52:44.374
However, I decided that I would take the word of the creator when it came to the number of different pieces of leather that were used, which were 4,500.

52:44.394 --> 52:46.256
I made no attempt to verify that.

52:46.656 --> 52:47.097
Extraordinary.

52:47.157 --> 52:48.238
Counting the jewels was enough.

52:49.119 --> 52:51.221
But anyway, it is an extraordinary piece.

52:51.541 --> 52:53.023
And it was...

52:53.425 --> 52:58.673
the second best of its type for a while.

52:58.933 --> 53:07.605
But then the great tragedy that is in everyone's mind, namely the sinking of the Titanic, ended up destroying the most fabulous of this type of life.

53:07.625 --> 53:09.829
It went down in the Titanic, the famous Omar.

53:09.929 --> 53:10.970
I knew that one had gone down.

53:10.990 --> 53:15.096
I didn't realize it was regarded as... This was the penultimate.

53:15.136 --> 53:16.198
This is all in the catalog.

53:16.318 --> 53:19.162
So it has all these romantic stories attached to it.

53:19.222 --> 53:22.006
So I think this has become one of my favorites.

53:22.026 --> 53:23.348
So it may not be everybody's favorite.

53:24.121 --> 53:27.284
Well, you wonder if that would have survived at that depth after all these years.

53:28.065 --> 53:29.586
I don't think the leathers went down there.

53:29.967 --> 53:31.348
I'm just wondering.

53:34.752 --> 53:49.386
Yes, there were other stories connected with that, too, that they tried to make a replica of it, and that ended up in Berlin during the war, where it was kept in a container that was so hot that when they tried to recover it, they found only the gems.

53:49.990 --> 53:50.971
So that was that one.

53:51.132 --> 53:53.515
And so then they did a third Omar.

53:55.939 --> 53:56.920
And where is that one now?

53:57.120 --> 54:00.124
That one apparently is on display in the British Library.

54:00.866 --> 54:04.871
They did it after the designs, because all the drawings, which are very intricate, have survived.

54:04.891 --> 54:06.093
They're all preserved.

54:06.113 --> 54:10.099
So anyway, I'm not particularly fond of this because of all these stories.

54:10.179 --> 54:12.823
And it is a gorgeous piece of bookbinding.

54:12.843 --> 54:16.588
Now, did you all go to England and work in the selection?

54:17.041 --> 54:44.500
selecting things or was this basically sir paul getty well of course george pleasure i know george right well it's his show of course he spent a lot of time there and then bill and i also were able to go there and work uh at the warmsley library doing our research that's exciting this was very very nice to work actually in the place itself well and of course counting these jewels from a photograph would have been very trying indeed

54:44.750 --> 54:46.893
Well, did you ever lose your count and have to spat over again?

54:47.233 --> 54:49.236
How do you keep your count in something like that?

54:49.256 --> 54:59.468
Well, you do little diagrams, you see, because on the back, you see the little grave clusters, you see the little grave clusters, and each of those has one, about 15 or 20 jewels, and then you just do it, you do it piece by piece.

54:59.488 --> 55:00.469
Have you ever done that before?

55:01.671 --> 55:02.292
On a book?

55:02.312 --> 55:07.979
Yes, I counted the jewels in some of our jewel bindings, but never, never with an inventory of a thousand.

55:08.039 --> 55:12.985
Why is it necessary to double, to check up on the, on the, you know,

55:13.252 --> 55:14.474
the person who made the book?

55:14.494 --> 55:20.923
Well, because when you do an entry, you all want to make sure that, you know, that how the thing has been described is correct.

55:21.063 --> 55:29.535
And I think others might have simply accepted the count, but I thought, well, I'm going to check it just this week.

55:29.575 --> 55:30.076
That's great.

55:32.819 --> 55:34.402
How many times did you do it?

55:34.422 --> 55:35.203
I don't think that question is unknown.

55:35.223 --> 55:36.625
Disregarding the counting.

55:36.645 --> 55:40.731
Well, I tell you, it was much easier having someone else's count.

55:40.791 --> 55:42.533
If I had to have counted anew,

55:42.513 --> 55:50.004
But you know, when they say, well, there are so many garnets that make up the great postures, then that way it already gives you a mode of breaking it down.

55:50.425 --> 55:51.446
Don't go crazy.

55:51.627 --> 55:53.830
My first count, I'd be one off, two off.

55:54.131 --> 55:54.892
Have to do it again.

55:54.932 --> 55:56.194
Next one, I'd be three over.

55:56.434 --> 55:58.297
I had to recount some of them a few times.

55:58.517 --> 56:00.140
Well, this isn't just right, but anyway.

56:00.600 --> 56:02.243
So these are your two favorites.

56:02.423 --> 56:03.024
How about yourself?

56:03.064 --> 56:06.669
Yes, I'll tell you my favorites.

56:06.690 --> 56:08.352
Thank you.

56:09.175 --> 56:10.737
I mentioned that we went to Wormsley.

56:11.137 --> 56:12.158
Of course, it's important.

56:12.258 --> 56:16.282
All serious art historians would never consider writing about an object they haven't seen.

56:16.302 --> 56:18.104
Of course, I would think so.

56:18.505 --> 56:19.346
It's important.

56:20.106 --> 56:26.513
And one of my favorite objects is this little soldier that was made for Anne Boleyn, because of the romantic story connected with Anne.

56:27.314 --> 56:38.946
And also, I had read the literature on this book before, and when I was examining the book and doing my discussion of it,

56:39.112 --> 56:44.360
I found that this coat of arms was in a particular place that no one had commented on it.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.884
And I thought, well, why is it there in Psalm 110?

56:47.044 --> 56:47.325
Why?

56:47.445 --> 56:51.671
Because there's only two coats of arms in the book, one at the frontispiece, you expect, and then this one.

56:51.691 --> 56:54.215
And I thought, well, why there, full-page coat of arms?

56:54.956 --> 56:59.243
So I did something which no one else had done before, which is actually just read the psalm.

57:00.144 --> 57:01.286
See if that was significant.

57:01.626 --> 57:02.668
You actually went to the text.

57:02.948 --> 57:05.372
Yes, I read the book.

57:05.352 --> 57:06.313
That's good.

57:06.354 --> 57:07.055
I like that.

57:07.115 --> 57:08.337
That will find its way in here.

57:08.357 --> 57:09.578
That's very, very interesting.

57:09.598 --> 57:19.573
And discovered that this psalm has extremely interesting motives that might relate to the history of where Anne Boleyn was at this particular place in her journey towards queenship.

57:19.934 --> 57:25.563
And this, for instance, is the psalm that mentions that thou shalt be a king forever according to the order of Melchizedek.

57:25.643 --> 57:26.744
It has that phrase in it.

57:26.945 --> 57:31.191
And also the business about let your enemies be your footstool.

57:31.171 --> 57:41.907
And I thought certain key phrases like this might have been encouragement for Anne, as she was then in the process of trying to push Henry to the edge of cutting himself off from Rome.

57:41.927 --> 57:46.354
Because at this stage, when she acquired this book, Henry had not cut himself off yet.

57:46.734 --> 57:48.377
And she was extremely frustrated.

57:48.457 --> 57:49.418
She was a Protestant.

57:49.659 --> 57:51.421
She wanted her husband.

57:51.882 --> 57:53.344
She wanted the divorce to go through.

57:53.825 --> 57:56.249
And Henry was still resisting that.

57:56.689 --> 57:59.153
And so she commissioned this book.

57:59.437 --> 58:25.782
specifically must have asked for this coat of arms to be right here and it's the coat of arms that incorporates henry's name the you know the h-e-r you know now is this in the is this in the catalog yes this is in the catalog so you don't have to remember but but but but is that illustration that is also oh one street yes um and also i have a full set of illustrations with the exception of this one because so many people are they like this one

58:25.930 --> 58:29.460
and so I can get those to you later.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.586
And that's what I mentioned, looking at the actual objects.

58:31.786 --> 58:38.064
I'd seen the photographs of this, I had the literature in my hand before going to England, and I just thought, oh, well, interesting book, coat of arms, so what?

58:38.365 --> 58:40.952
But it was only when I was sitting there going through it, and I thought,

58:40.932 --> 58:42.594
you know, why is this here?

58:42.834 --> 58:43.855
There must have been a reason.

58:43.875 --> 58:49.039
And then reading the text, to me, revealed indeed that she could have had this then, used it to pray for him.

58:49.219 --> 58:56.566
And if Henry had dropped by, she could have opened it up right at this stage and said, oh, Henry, have you paid attention to this particular psalm recently?

58:56.586 --> 59:00.370
See, what you've done, this is almost, this is the ultimate association book.

59:00.390 --> 59:03.172
That's a phrase that we use in the association books.

59:03.192 --> 59:07.716
But what you've done is, and there's a lot of intuition that has to be done here.

59:07.736 --> 59:08.577
I mean, you do have to

59:09.012 --> 59:10.958
think about the evidence in front of you.

59:13.285 --> 59:17.699
But now you were looking at these primarily, initially, as art objects, is that right?

59:17.719 --> 59:19.344
Oh yes, sure, sure, yes.

59:19.484 --> 59:23.055
But, you know, I'm very interested in text-picture relationships.

59:23.221 --> 59:27.007
When something is odd about a book, then you start asking, well, why did it happen?

59:27.027 --> 59:27.728
Why did it occur?

59:27.808 --> 59:31.855
Why did the person who commissioned this want this coat of arms at this particular stage?

59:32.136 --> 59:35.581
Tell me a little bit about your interest in text-picture relationships.

59:35.601 --> 59:37.624
That's something that interests me.

59:38.045 --> 59:41.471
And that doesn't even have to be necessarily with objects in this collection.

59:41.511 --> 59:47.140
This is another one of my favorites that relates to text-picture relations.

59:47.220 --> 59:49.043
This is a book of ours, French.

59:49.327 --> 59:57.697
And it might not have been included in the exhibition were it not for the fact that it has an extremely unusual series of calendar illustrations.

59:57.758 --> 01:00:07.430
Now, it was the tradition for Books of Hours to have a picture, usually of the zodiacal sign, or what's called the labor of the month, trimming grapevines, reaping, sowing.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.153
And this was a tradition that went back hundreds of years.

01:00:10.505 --> 01:00:17.713
But here we have a manuscript that was made for Mr. Gouffier, the Gouffier Hours, and he's in the catalogue, I forget which exact.

01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:18.574
Adrian Gouffier.

01:00:18.654 --> 01:00:21.017
Well, it's kind of like an item 19, yes.

01:00:21.137 --> 01:00:22.619
Who's part of the French Renaissance.

01:00:22.899 --> 01:00:29.346
And part of that, and he must have asked for that, because it comes out of the blue.

01:00:29.687 --> 01:00:36.354
Instead of having the labours of the month, what you have are these illustrations of the antique origins of the name of each month.

01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:37.896
So here we have...

01:00:38.365 --> 01:00:45.875
the goddess Juno and her daughter, and these various characters, any of whose names might have given the name to the month of June.

01:00:46.356 --> 01:00:50.782
So this is a very interesting text-picture relationship that is really unique.

01:00:50.822 --> 01:00:59.614
I don't know of another example of a book of ours that has the antique origins illustrated for the names of the month.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:11.021
And it's not only an interesting text-picture relationship-wise, but also the fact that it's an object of the Renaissance, the French Renaissance, you know, where there is an interest in antiquity.

01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:25.197
And you can only get an example like this in the late 15th, early 16th century, at the milieu of this court, Charles VIII and Louis XII, who were importing Italian artists, you know, constantly running down Italy to conquer it.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.892
bringing back books, bringing back libraries, and the court of Cardinal George D'Amboise.

01:01:30.932 --> 01:01:38.408
They were very interested in Italian culture at this time, and this is the result of that intense interest in things.

01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:40.452
So books of hours were pretty much

01:01:40.803 --> 01:01:44.510
produced according to the specific requests of the individual?

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:45.111
They could be.

01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:52.644
You could modify them pictorially and textually and ask for things like this because it was for your own private use.

01:01:52.664 --> 01:01:55.710
See, books of ours weren't controlled by the church.

01:01:56.571 --> 01:02:00.699
It wasn't like a missal or a choir book where the official church sanction had to be there.

01:02:00.939 --> 01:02:05.207
They were a little bit beyond the control and therefore individual patrons could ask for

01:02:05.187 --> 01:02:11.513
specific kinds of text and pictures to be put in them, and they could be modified and be very unique.

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:12.314
Wonderful.

01:02:12.334 --> 01:02:12.794
Wonderful.

01:02:12.814 --> 01:02:16.037
The last favorite object I'll talk about.

01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:18.340
I just have to meet my editor.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.983
This is the column that I think the public will be very interested in.

01:02:22.003 --> 01:02:23.405
And this is number six.

01:02:23.485 --> 01:02:24.045
Number six.

01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:24.966
This is on the wall.

01:02:24.986 --> 01:02:26.428
This is framed on the wall.

01:02:26.688 --> 01:02:27.489
Four leaves.

01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:29.210
There are only four of them that survived.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.312
They came up at auction in 1986.

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:34.215
They had been in a private collection.

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:43.508
Until then, they had been known only through old photographs, but no one had seen them in 50, 60 years, at least two generations.

01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:46.652
And they came up with a private collection that sailed at Sotheby's.

01:02:47.433 --> 01:02:51.758
It cost a great big stir, a lot of interest, for a number of reasons.

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:57.064
One is that they are the earliest illustrated life of Thomas Beckett.

01:02:58.158 --> 01:03:22.022
date here from the middle of the 13th century wow so you're talking about uh less than 50 years after the death of the archbishop so i mean this is you know stupendous and they're english and um this is vellum yes and they're also quite beautiful and quite poignant i love this scene of in the dispute between thomas beckett and henry ii

01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:26.359
The pope, Alexander, got involved because he wanted to keep the peace.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.407
And so he tried to reconcile the two.

01:03:29.528 --> 01:03:30.470
It didn't quite work.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.495
And this is the leave-taking.

01:03:32.556 --> 01:03:34.240
There they are in horseback.

01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:39.515
You know, embracing each other, giving each other a farewell sort of kiss of peace as they're about to ride off.

01:03:39.535 --> 01:03:41.841
This is one of the most touching scenes.

01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:45.409
These beautiful poignant scenes hardly exist in the 13th century.

01:03:45.911 --> 01:03:47.374
You said this caused a big stir?

01:03:47.555 --> 01:03:48.016
Oh, yes.

01:03:48.537 --> 01:03:52.667
Well, because they are the earliest illustrated life of Thomas Beckett.

01:03:52.647 --> 01:04:19.870
a big deal because they were english that makes them closer to home because they were done within you know uh 50 years of but the stir being that that they shouldn't go into private ownership no no the stir being that there are a lot of people who wanted to acquire the personal collectors and uh private institutions i was working at the walters art gallery then and uh we got word that we were very interested and i know we weren't the only one was it a private transaction or was it kind of auction no they went at auction

01:04:20.879 --> 01:04:22.322
Self-abuse?

01:04:22.342 --> 01:04:25.008
I'll check it out.

01:04:25.048 --> 01:04:27.594
The provenance will be in the catalog.

01:04:28.336 --> 01:04:31.543
So these wonderful episodes... Self-abuse in England or here?

01:04:31.623 --> 01:04:32.786
Self-abuse in England.

01:04:32.806 --> 01:04:37.757
These wonderful episodes that people... I mean, if anybody from the Middle Ages...

01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:44.532
that the common person off the street might know about, they will have heard of Thomas Beckett.

01:04:44.752 --> 01:04:57.400
And it's, of course, the conflict, church-state conflicts that were behind this tragedy, these two men, are still conflicts that exist today in America and other countries.

01:04:57.565 --> 01:04:59.168
separation of church and state.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:08.002
In other words, there are still echoes today of the basic components of the conflict between these two, the relationship between church and state.

01:05:08.022 --> 01:05:09.024
And these were part of a book?

01:05:09.445 --> 01:05:10.927
These were part of a book.

01:05:11.167 --> 01:05:13.491
Do you know for whom it was produced?

01:05:13.591 --> 01:05:14.253
No, no.

01:05:14.533 --> 01:05:16.556
And these are just the only ones that survived?

01:05:16.616 --> 01:05:17.298
These are the only ones.

01:05:17.318 --> 01:05:20.363
They were probably used in a bookbinding as padding, which is why they survived.

01:05:22.146 --> 01:05:23.067
Amazing, huh?

01:05:23.435 --> 01:05:24.479
So there are four of these.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.165
Did they just come to light in 86?

01:05:26.586 --> 01:05:28.192
They had been known.

01:05:28.232 --> 01:05:31.183
As I said, old photographs had existed, but people didn't know where they were.

01:05:31.243 --> 01:05:32.528
No one had seen them for years.

01:05:32.548 --> 01:05:33.411
You think they were bindings?

01:05:34.015 --> 01:05:38.339
They've been probably used as part of a binary, yes, which is why they had survived.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.780
What's on the other side?

01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:45.106
There are four pictures here on view, and there are four other pictures of different episodes.

01:05:45.486 --> 01:05:46.006
On the other side?

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:46.927
On the other side, yes.

01:05:46.987 --> 01:05:48.208
There are a total of eight pictures.

01:05:48.969 --> 01:05:54.054
So at some place in the world, perhaps, there are books that might have these?

01:05:54.074 --> 01:05:57.017
There could be, yes, as possible.

01:05:57.037 --> 01:05:59.619
Interesting, and that's the Ptolemy, of course, right?

01:05:59.639 --> 01:06:01.041
I was present when that was purchased.

01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:03.583
I was purchased in 1990, when I was writing Channel 2.
