WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:05.102
Talking to John.

00:05.142 --> 00:06.103
John, how do you pronounce your name?

00:06.143 --> 00:06.523
Kucica.

00:06.684 --> 00:07.344
Kucica.

00:07.364 --> 00:08.185
Just the way it sounds.

00:08.886 --> 00:16.133
And as long as those numbers portraying as they are, I'll put it like this so I can see it.

00:16.153 --> 00:17.795
That way I'll have to check it.

00:19.256 --> 00:20.357
So, John, you've been here.

00:21.098 --> 00:23.020
You've been at Yale how long?

00:24.281 --> 00:27.184
Since July of 2001.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.505
Oh, fairly recent.

00:28.526 --> 00:30.027
Fairly recent, yeah.

00:30.047 --> 00:30.748
And your title?

00:31.348 --> 00:32.029
Senior editor.

00:32.397 --> 00:38.284
senior editor, and you specialize in areas, and you like literature, I guess, is what they say.

00:38.385 --> 00:44.532
Literature, literary studies, philosophy, poetry, and here and there politics.

00:46.615 --> 00:46.695
Hmm.

00:46.715 --> 00:51.201
So poetry from the Yale Younger Poet Series?

00:51.321 --> 00:51.841
That does.

00:52.442 --> 00:55.846
John Holliday, by the way, too, is another one of my subjects.

00:57.468 --> 01:00.312
John would be one of the best on the history.

01:01.017 --> 01:05.101
But I've got that covered inside out, yeah.

01:05.121 --> 01:05.322
Good.

01:06.002 --> 01:09.506
So I do oversee the L-series vulnerability.

01:11.168 --> 01:15.313
As you know, it started in 1919.

01:17.175 --> 01:25.684
However, we went 80-some years into the history of the series without a female judge.

01:26.505 --> 01:26.805
Wow.

01:27.697 --> 01:34.984
So I actually have the distinction of having appointed the first female judge of the series, Louise Gillespie.

01:36.125 --> 01:38.607
So Louise is the current judge.

01:40.529 --> 01:48.417
There's one year left on her contract, and I will probably extend to her an offer to renew that contract.

01:48.437 --> 01:50.939
And the original contract was for how long?

01:50.959 --> 01:54.162
The original contract was for five years.

01:55.324 --> 01:55.864
I love that.

01:56.232 --> 01:58.814
It's almost unique, isn't it, among competitions?

02:00.095 --> 02:00.356
Right.

02:00.376 --> 02:12.927
The idea for extending a long contract like that is that an individual poet gets to shape a generation of new voices.

02:13.187 --> 02:14.428
So W.H.

02:14.448 --> 02:18.031
Auden, for example, was judge of the series for 11 years.

02:18.852 --> 02:24.957
And so talk a little bit about how he worked to shape American poetry during that period.

02:26.185 --> 02:35.936
I mean, some people think, some historians of the series think that Auden was the best judge of the series.

02:36.357 --> 02:39.260
I mean, he, for example, picked John Hollander.

02:39.340 --> 02:41.563
He picked John Ashbery.

02:41.603 --> 02:47.109
I think he may have picked as well Robert Haas.

02:47.129 --> 02:47.730
Let me see.

02:49.132 --> 02:52.736
If you don't know this book, you'll want to look at it.

02:53.076 --> 02:55.399
The Younger Poets Anthology.

02:57.421 --> 03:03.128
The introduction by George Bradley is first-rate.

03:05.110 --> 03:10.556
But among others, Auden picked W.S.

03:10.616 --> 03:15.622
Merlin, Adrienne Rich, John Ashbery, James Wright.

03:15.682 --> 03:20.448
And these are the first published collections of these.

03:21.289 --> 03:21.770
That's right.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.291
It's the first book away.

03:23.311 --> 03:27.276
So when you think, you know, when these people are being introduced,

03:28.370 --> 03:29.632
African literary world.

03:29.712 --> 03:33.077
Their names could be anyone's name.

03:33.097 --> 03:43.894
We know them now as great American poets, but a lot of them is picking, is plucking these talents out of this.

03:45.336 --> 03:48.962
You get hundreds of, dozens of scores, I don't know.

03:48.982 --> 03:52.166
You get a lot of applicants participating.

03:52.187 --> 03:53.328
Last year I got about 700.

03:53.348 --> 03:54.770
700?

03:55.532 --> 03:57.094
Wow.

03:57.327 --> 04:00.532
You must put together a short list, Walker, though.

04:00.552 --> 04:09.505
I have a group of six or seven readers, each responsible for about a hundred manuscripts.

04:09.825 --> 04:20.240
They will winnow those hundred down to four or five, which they then pass on to Louise.

04:20.380 --> 04:23.244
And from those, she makes her selection.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.107
It's my responsibility, don't you think?

04:25.525 --> 04:28.228
Oh, absolutely.

04:29.729 --> 04:45.105
You know, the series, I suppose, is interesting for all of those who have come out of it, but the series is so old and distinguished that it's also interesting to see who's been passed over.

04:45.165 --> 04:53.794
Sylvia Plath, for example, was devastated because she didn't win.

04:54.314 --> 04:55.976
She entered at least once.

04:56.797 --> 05:02.044
Is there something in any of her biographies that I can... I think you could probably, yeah, you could easily find that.

05:02.825 --> 05:07.391
Louise Glick, for example, entered three or four times in everyone.

05:07.411 --> 05:11.437
The judge, the woman who is judging the competition.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.097
Where is she at?

05:13.399 --> 05:14.300
She's now at Yale.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.824
She's teaching here at Yale.

05:16.844 --> 05:18.746
So I could probably send her an email and chat with her.

05:19.427 --> 05:21.009
No, Louise doesn't do email.

05:21.990 --> 05:23.933
But I'd love to get a quote from her.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.751
Oh, yeah.

05:26.231 --> 05:27.553
Could you put me in touch?

05:27.573 --> 05:27.873
I could.

05:27.893 --> 05:28.614
You should speak with me.

05:28.634 --> 05:30.396
When I get back, I'll send you an email.

05:31.277 --> 05:32.418
Absolutely.

05:32.478 --> 05:33.499
A telephoner is fine.

05:33.519 --> 05:38.184
It doesn't have to be a sit-down, but I'd love to get some thoughts.

05:38.244 --> 05:47.794
I really want to give, and let me just say, this should go on the record, to grab my attention when I get back to transcribing, how important it is.

05:48.755 --> 05:49.296
In terms of

05:50.086 --> 05:55.113
a nut here, what Yale spends and how much it generates in terms of income.

05:55.133 --> 06:02.282
The poetry series probably doesn't even measure on a richer scale, right?

06:02.302 --> 06:02.963
It's minuscule.

06:03.144 --> 06:03.544
That's right.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.667
And I don't know how many copies of the book that you published.

06:05.687 --> 06:09.873
What would you say the actual annual print mark is?

06:10.193 --> 06:18.885
An average book in the series may sell in cloth of 1,500 copies at the outside.

06:18.905 --> 06:19.806
Well, that's pretty good.

06:20.258 --> 06:23.281
That's very good.

06:23.301 --> 06:23.401
Yeah.

06:23.421 --> 06:27.986
But even if it were 300 or 400 or 500, there's no question that we would do it.

06:29.307 --> 06:29.568
Oh, no.

06:29.608 --> 06:30.509
Yeah, no.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.210
Absolutely.

06:32.230 --> 06:33.211
We published the winner.

06:34.573 --> 06:34.933
Period.

06:35.233 --> 06:46.485
And this is part of the mission, not to use an overused word, but the mission of a university prospect, this one in particular.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.203
I mean, is that something that you can pick up on?

06:49.223 --> 06:51.806
Sure, and particularly the series.

06:51.826 --> 07:00.037
You know, it is, the Yale series of younger poets is the oldest annual literary award in North America.

07:00.057 --> 07:01.299
There isn't one that's older.

07:02.821 --> 07:08.088
So it is, um... It's not only the fact that it's venerable.

07:08.588 --> 07:09.710
I'm interrupting you.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.672
I shouldn't do that.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.616
But, you know, we have any number of other literary awards.

07:15.254 --> 07:26.191
that recognized fiction, that recognized whatever, but I just wonder how important this particular, not just the award, but the competition is to sustaining American poetry.

07:26.351 --> 07:27.172
It's significant.

07:27.593 --> 07:30.397
Nobody really publishes poetry anymore.

07:30.417 --> 07:39.591
It's so hard for a young poet to go out and to find some validation in terms of not only being published, but being considered for cover.

07:40.516 --> 07:49.990
To give you hope and to... Yeah, I mean, I think you could make the argument that the Yale series of younger poets is its own credible national literature.

07:50.010 --> 07:54.837
I mean, if you just look at... That's exactly what I wanted to.

07:54.857 --> 07:55.218
Thank you.

07:55.238 --> 07:55.859
Keep going with it.

07:56.600 --> 08:08.177
But if you look at all of the American poets that have been published in the series since 1919, it's not quite the American canon, but it's...

08:08.579 --> 08:36.190
You know it's a lot of our important and significant poets of the 20th century. I don't think it's a stretch to say to make this comparison. If somebody goes out and spends six million dollars for first full of Shakespeare that just happened a couple weeks ago. It's not that one person spent six million dollars. It's that there was an underbidder. It was somebody else who also, I mean you never you can't

08:36.777 --> 08:41.182
You need two people to drive and to establish the price.

08:41.923 --> 08:47.089
The comparison I'm trying to make is, it's not just the winner of the, you know, this poet.

08:47.129 --> 08:48.671
Look at those who haven't won.

08:49.292 --> 09:00.245
And yet, because there's competition and there's interest, it's not just that you get one winner, it's also that you have other very good people competing for it and generating the interest.

09:00.265 --> 09:04.270
I don't know if that's a valid point to me, but it seems to me that

09:05.347 --> 09:07.369
You have 700 entries.

09:07.410 --> 09:08.311
That's the point.

09:08.331 --> 09:10.714
That's the larger point.

09:10.774 --> 09:12.716
That's the larger point.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.439
It's a rite of passage.

09:15.599 --> 09:26.733
Even if they don't win, entering the Younger Poets Competition is a rite of passage for any young poet who is considering a professional career.

09:27.314 --> 09:31.639
And now you're about to embark on a playwright competition.

09:31.659 --> 09:34.122
That's correct.

09:34.372 --> 09:43.082
And if anything's harder in this country for creative artists than to publish poetry, it's to produce a play.

09:43.242 --> 09:52.353
How in the world anyone would aspire to be a playwright when you realize how often and where are new plays mounted?

09:53.455 --> 10:00.683
And now you have this competition that involves publication and a Yale rep staging.

10:00.882 --> 10:05.187
I prefer to think of it as the trifecta.

10:06.868 --> 10:14.977
The winner gets his or her winning manuscript published by Yale University Press.

10:15.898 --> 10:25.869
Gets a staged reading at the Yale Rep with the possibility of a full production at the Yale Rep.

10:25.889 --> 10:29.893
The Yale will have 90 days to exercise its options.

10:30.481 --> 10:33.924
an option on the production of the play.

10:33.944 --> 10:45.875
And the winner also gets a purse of $10,000, and that purse is called the David C. Horne Award.

10:46.616 --> 10:48.178
No, the poet doesn't get a purse, right?

10:49.499 --> 10:51.981
The poet does not get a purse.

10:52.141 --> 10:58.227
We don't have that kind of endowment for the... So, at that level of the hop, the Horne endowment, that's mainly because

10:58.713 --> 11:00.595
the benefactor has chosen to do that.

11:00.735 --> 11:01.156
That's right.

11:01.196 --> 11:05.860
Wouldn't it be nice if somebody were to come forward and do a similar sort of thing for the poet?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.702
I'm just speaking speculatively.

11:07.922 --> 11:11.306
You know, I'm looking for that.

11:12.307 --> 11:12.727
So you are?

11:13.388 --> 11:18.674
I'm looking for someone to create an endowment for the younger poet series.

11:18.934 --> 11:27.943
We have a small endowment now, but it's not one that will allow us to give any kind of significant cash prize for winners.

11:28.379 --> 11:30.942
But winning it is different.

11:32.584 --> 11:37.971
A playwright actually hopes to make a commercial venture out of this.

11:37.991 --> 11:42.157
If you're lucky, you hope to make a living out of it.

11:42.177 --> 11:43.138
That would be a professional.

11:43.999 --> 11:55.934
I think the playwrights may actually have a harder time than poets.

11:55.955 --> 11:57.897
For whatever reason, Americans just

11:58.653 --> 12:01.095
Don't read plays.

12:01.215 --> 12:02.817
I mean, sure, they read Shakespeare.

12:02.837 --> 12:11.845
If you're looking at one of the few, I have a full run of Tennessee Williams first edition, for instance, and it's the one collection I wouldn't part with, by the way.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.567
But try this out as an exercise.

12:13.587 --> 12:16.170
Go to your local Borders, Barnes & Noble.

12:16.190 --> 12:16.930
Oh, try to find one.

12:16.990 --> 12:18.232
Go to the drama section.

12:18.372 --> 12:22.736
What you will find is Shakespeare, O'Neill, Tennessee Williams.

12:22.756 --> 12:25.999
Maybe a paperback of who's played a Virginia Woolf.

12:26.019 --> 12:26.179
Exactly.

12:26.632 --> 12:30.296
David Mamet, things you'll find, maybe, because he's... Maybe.

12:30.717 --> 12:41.009
But you will have, beyond a handful of names, you will probably now find a contemporary playwright represented on your shelf.

12:41.029 --> 12:42.190
I think that's a wonderful idea.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.453
And it generated in here, apparently.

12:44.773 --> 12:46.375
Yes, that's right.

12:46.776 --> 12:49.699
And this is one of those stories... It came out of this office, right?

12:49.819 --> 12:52.302
Well, tell me a bit about it.

12:53.699 --> 13:11.252
Out of the blue, I got a phone call from Francine Horn, the benefactor, and she said to me, what can you do with a million dollars?

13:13.578 --> 13:17.342
And I proposed three different... You know sound bites, right?

13:17.362 --> 13:21.285
You know, can you just see quotes, you know, then get into the manuscript?

13:21.305 --> 13:21.766
That's one.

13:21.846 --> 13:24.589
You gave me one earlier, several earlier, but that's perfect.

13:24.609 --> 13:24.989
Keep going.

13:27.411 --> 13:28.933
What could you do with a million dollars?

13:28.953 --> 13:30.855
And did you know Francine Hornet?

13:30.875 --> 13:31.896
I didn't know her.

13:31.936 --> 13:36.140
She was pointed in my direction from Sandy McClatchy, the poet Sandy McClatchy.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.383
And... Spell the name?

13:40.084 --> 13:41.145
McClatchy?

13:41.165 --> 13:42.166
Oh, it's G.G.

13:42.326 --> 13:42.606
McClatchy.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.285
Who I have to talk to, by the way, about Longfellow.

13:46.106 --> 13:46.467
Yeah.

13:46.487 --> 13:48.790
I'm doing an interview tomorrow with Chip Kidd, by the way.

13:48.810 --> 13:52.435
He's talking about how things all come around from my column, Find Books and Collections.

13:52.475 --> 13:52.655
Okay.

13:52.876 --> 13:56.861
Doing a piece on... Down in New York or up here?

13:56.881 --> 13:59.745
I wanted to get down to New York, but he's in Connecticut.

13:59.845 --> 14:00.446
Okay.

14:01.968 --> 14:02.609
So McClatchy.

14:04.131 --> 14:05.573
Pointed her in my direction.

14:05.941 --> 14:35.880
I outlined for her three different uh possibilities, um four different possibilities, only two of them even involving yeah. Um but the one that that really caught her imagination was the drama competition. Yeah who is she exactly? I mean obviously a woman of some means but. She and her husband her late husband made their money in the fashion industry

14:36.350 --> 14:44.958
and her late husband, David, was an aspiring writer.

14:47.240 --> 14:59.451
Had a friendship with many actors, including British actor.

14:59.471 --> 15:02.013
He was in the movie The Unforgiven.

15:02.434 --> 15:06.137
He played Bob.

15:06.421 --> 15:07.442
Richard Harris.

15:07.463 --> 15:11.168
Richard Harris is great, yeah, okay.

15:11.188 --> 15:14.533
And he, in fact, he and Harris wrote a screenplay together.

15:15.474 --> 15:21.903
But the point is, David had never published, but this was his aspiration.

15:22.124 --> 15:28.713
So, to honor the memory of her husband, um... Approximately, how old is she?

15:28.733 --> 15:29.374
Where is she?

15:29.474 --> 15:30.816
She's 69.

15:31.497 --> 15:35.483
That's why I'm 63.

15:37.910 --> 15:42.395
But she wanted to do something, obviously, with her creative arts.

15:42.555 --> 15:49.303
She wanted to do something that would, you know, outlive her, and that would go on for years and years.

15:50.184 --> 15:56.752
So the idea was that the Yale drama series would be modeled in part on the Young and the Post competition.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.574
So you generated that?

15:59.455 --> 15:59.916
That's right.

16:00.016 --> 16:01.598
So was this kind of on the fly, on the phone?

16:02.379 --> 16:04.681
No, I gave her a written proposal.

16:04.982 --> 16:07.765
But when you had this conversation,

16:08.167 --> 16:10.130
How can I spend a million dollars?

16:10.591 --> 16:11.673
I said you had three.

16:11.713 --> 16:23.051
Had you been thinking about the playwright's... We talked in a very casual way, and I said, you know what, let me think about it, and let me give you a written proposal.

16:24.834 --> 16:29.061
And, you know, it took her all two or three days to make up her mind.

16:30.824 --> 16:35.271
And... So what really drove your...

16:35.757 --> 17:03.256
I was thinking the dramatic arcs for a couple of reasons, primarily because it seems to me that, and I don't have an explanation as to why, but the dramatic arcs are not really treated as a part of American literary culture.

17:03.316 --> 17:04.077
It's an oddity.

17:04.698 --> 17:12.889
I mean, as I said already, you know, I don't think Americans really read plays.

17:12.909 --> 17:20.279
Moreover, playwrights are not welcomed into the community of writers in the way that poets are.

17:20.299 --> 17:21.500
Go back to Shakespeare's time.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.463
They were scoundrels.

17:23.523 --> 17:28.229
They were scoundrels and highwaymen.

17:28.269 --> 17:33.456
And today, they're on the very margins of literary culture.

17:34.128 --> 17:38.233
For example, look at all the MFA programs around the country.

17:38.273 --> 17:43.200
There are very few programs that actually offer writing degrees in drama.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.061
Why is that?

17:44.862 --> 17:47.706
Look at all the summer writing conferences.

17:47.846 --> 18:02.084
The only one that is open to playwrights, the only summer writing conference that has a dramatic arts writing component is the Sewanee Writers' Conference.

18:02.104 --> 18:02.785
It's the only one.

18:03.068 --> 18:07.974
And the flip side of that, of course, is every kid wants to be a script writer.

18:07.994 --> 18:09.676
Because that's where the big money is to go out.

18:09.976 --> 18:11.057
That's right.

18:11.077 --> 18:12.759
And even then, that's not easy either.

18:12.799 --> 18:21.970
But you have the USC, UCLA film school programs, plenty of programs on writing for film.

18:21.990 --> 18:26.875
But really, very hardly anything to support legitimate theater.

18:26.895 --> 18:27.336
That's right.

18:27.416 --> 18:32.822
I mean, I think film has really knocked down the...

18:33.578 --> 18:35.000
state of the stage.

18:35.741 --> 18:37.824
It's a cousin in terms of the creative.

18:37.844 --> 18:39.006
It's a cousin, yeah.

18:39.086 --> 18:40.087
But it's a poor cousin.

18:40.428 --> 18:41.549
A poor cousin.

18:41.569 --> 18:42.110
Absolutely.

18:42.971 --> 18:58.433
And I think this really does feed into the whole scope that I'm trying to apply here to this kind of lively, I hope, examination of the University Press and what University Press is supposed to do.

18:59.194 --> 19:01.678
I mean, to survive today, you really have to sell

19:02.030 --> 19:05.495
books like the Gombrich, you know, you'd love it when you read something like that.

19:05.535 --> 19:06.076
God bless it.

19:06.096 --> 19:10.683
It's a wonderful little book, and it sold 98,000 copies, and they're fabulous.

19:10.923 --> 19:13.006
You know, the Kupuyama is way up there.

19:13.206 --> 19:15.049
You know, the Gordidal is 100,000 copies.

19:16.751 --> 19:25.043
And I think I'm actually getting a breakdown of how many books have sold over 5,000, how many fell over 10, and at least published 300 to 400 books a year.

19:25.064 --> 19:30.231
But through all of this, as we, you know, put it through the great mixer, the great

19:31.122 --> 19:35.986
You are performing a function for the world of letters and for the world of scholarship.

19:36.006 --> 19:40.571
And here's an area, apparently, that you saw that was not existing.

19:41.011 --> 19:46.976
And yet, it is part of the world of letters and the world of, I don't know, creation.

19:46.996 --> 19:50.199
Am I thinking here?

19:50.219 --> 19:54.323
Am I going according to what your mind thought?

19:54.903 --> 19:55.844
No, absolutely.

19:55.944 --> 19:59.948
I mean, I would say that Yale was a trade publisher.

20:00.164 --> 20:10.700
It's a scholarly publisher, and it's also a publisher which is integral to American literary culture.

20:11.542 --> 20:12.203
It's all of this.

20:15.528 --> 20:25.704
I mean, my God, you know, the Yale Younger Poets Competition alone is just such an important part of American literary history.

20:25.744 --> 20:27.927
You couldn't really tell the story.

20:28.733 --> 20:35.119
of American poetry in the 20th century without talking about the American poetry competition.

20:36.561 --> 20:38.403
I thought I'd get a quote from Ellen Bendler.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.626
I'm sure she must have a thought on it.

20:41.646 --> 20:43.348
It would be worth recording.

20:43.868 --> 20:49.634
And again, Louise, if you get some quotes, one of them this year is actually... Louise would be great.

20:49.954 --> 20:55.040
I'd love to get her voice in here, you know, on this album.

20:55.060 --> 20:58.403
You might want to speak to a couple of the winners, too.

20:58.838 --> 20:59.258
Okay.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.680
A couple of them recent winners.

21:00.700 --> 21:00.960
Sure.

21:01.501 --> 21:04.224
Maybe you can recommend if you'll do it.

21:04.405 --> 21:06.227
I can, sure.

21:06.247 --> 21:06.547
Absolutely.

21:06.567 --> 21:10.412
Let's talk generally, you know, about, what did you do?

21:10.652 --> 21:12.774
You came here in 2001, July of 2001.

21:12.794 --> 21:17.520
And why don't you just to finish the biography from where and your own background in publishing?

21:17.540 --> 21:17.780
Sure.

21:19.562 --> 21:23.547
I've been in the industry for 15 years.

21:24.387 --> 21:30.718
Most of my career was in retail.

21:30.978 --> 21:37.950
I worked many years in the Barnes & Noble corporate offices.

21:37.970 --> 21:46.224
I also had been en route for a while toward an advanced degree in literature at Columbia.

21:48.768 --> 21:49.770
Where did you do your undergrad?

21:50.240 --> 21:52.062
Lehigh University.

21:52.463 --> 21:54.205
That's how you know it would be Pennsylvania.

21:54.445 --> 21:59.532
I bet, indeed, you're right.

21:59.552 --> 22:05.780
And I also had this before I came... Home is where?

22:06.861 --> 22:09.084
Home is Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

22:09.905 --> 22:11.147
I'm sorry, and you've had this idea.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.910
I do this, I'm sorry.

22:13.970 --> 22:15.652
No, no, that's okay.

22:15.712 --> 22:17.074
I was going to say that

22:18.708 --> 22:22.352
I've had, for a while now, a moonlighting career as a fiction editor.

22:22.372 --> 22:28.460
So when I came to Yale, it was not only with this retail background, but also as a fiction editor.

22:30.462 --> 22:30.943
For a trade?

22:31.564 --> 22:36.930
In a trade world, I edit Best in the American Voices for Harcourt.

22:36.950 --> 22:41.476
I've also edited fiction for Scribner and other places.

22:41.496 --> 22:44.099
I've probably edited 20 or 30 anthologies.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.263
So that's...

22:47.733 --> 22:52.880
Any authors in particular that would resonate?

22:52.900 --> 22:55.223
Authors that you've edited?

22:55.243 --> 23:09.742
Authors I've discovered, you know, I guess I could take credit for David Benioff, who wrote the novel The 25th Hour, which was adapt to the screen by Spike Lee.

23:11.645 --> 23:17.132
Jennifer Vanderbese, I thought I was the first person to publish her.

23:20.555 --> 23:22.657
Oh, gosh, there are lots of them.

23:22.737 --> 23:23.498
Oh, that's right.

23:23.518 --> 23:26.281
Is it an interest in literary fiction, per se, would you say?

23:26.321 --> 23:28.584
Yeah, literary fiction, yeah.

23:28.604 --> 23:28.704
Okay.

23:28.724 --> 23:29.845
Well, you don't have to look now.

23:29.865 --> 23:38.795
Again, these e-mails, the factual thing, which is very interesting because Yale really doesn't publish fiction.

23:38.815 --> 23:39.136
That's right.

23:39.956 --> 23:44.942
And so tell me how it happened that you came here to Yale as an editor.

23:46.627 --> 23:50.531
It's not such an interesting story.

23:50.592 --> 23:57.900
There was an ad in a publisher's book, which I called Jonathan, and that was it.

23:58.821 --> 23:59.382
But what is it?

23:59.802 --> 24:02.465
You must be looking for something in an editor.

24:02.825 --> 24:07.150
Tell me how an editor functions in a place like you.

24:07.170 --> 24:13.798
Well, I think that Jonathan's at the risk with me, because my route into editing is not the typical one.

24:15.061 --> 24:20.749
I had all of this retail experience, and then I had this weird moonlighting career as a fiction editor.

24:21.770 --> 24:26.616
I can see it myself, but maybe I find it very interesting.

24:27.738 --> 24:32.384
It's certainly not the typical story.

24:33.265 --> 24:44.460
I don't know that my career path is unique, but I can't really think of anyone else who spent so much time in retail and then made the jump.

24:45.672 --> 24:50.157
What makes a good editor, in your view?

24:52.900 --> 24:54.201
A good acquisitions editor.

24:58.727 --> 24:59.688
So you said acquisitions.

25:00.609 --> 25:02.811
Editor, I guess, there are all kinds of editors, right?

25:03.672 --> 25:04.092
There are.

25:04.473 --> 25:11.140
I mean, some acquisitions editors are also good manuscript editors.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.464
Some acquisitions editors are

25:15.153 --> 25:18.737
good publishers, but not necessarily.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.439
They're different skill sets.

25:20.459 --> 25:24.043
Of course, ideally you want someone who possesses all three.

25:24.624 --> 25:37.098
You want someone who has an excellent acquisitions eye, who also has some skills, some manuscript editor, and who is also a savvy publisher.

25:38.840 --> 25:43.725
Very rarely do you have to be at this quality in one person.

25:44.667 --> 25:48.913
So if you go back to what makes a good acquisitions editor?

25:48.933 --> 25:51.617
What makes a good acquisitions editor?

25:54.502 --> 26:02.093
Well, first, it's, I mean, as Hemingway put it, it's having a good shift after.

26:02.313 --> 26:06.960
I mean, you have to know shit when you see that.

26:07.080 --> 26:11.267
But you'll... Oh, you've never written a Yale Press book?

26:11.287 --> 26:13.330
I know.

26:13.650 --> 26:14.151
But it's...

26:14.435 --> 26:21.302
You know, you need to be able to see the dreck right away, but you also need to be able to see what's the value.

26:23.044 --> 26:26.768
Well, does retail also give you an eye for the marketplace, too?

26:26.788 --> 26:27.208
Yes.

26:27.228 --> 26:29.271
Does that work into your deliberations?

26:29.291 --> 26:30.051
It does indeed.

26:31.113 --> 26:43.986
When I'm looking at trade books, I'm looking at them somewhat, or at least with one eye, as a retailer, as a former retailer.

26:45.772 --> 26:53.621
So I do have a good sense of what will work anymore.

26:53.641 --> 27:05.695
My God, if I can't do that, after buying books in the corporate office for 12 years, 10 years in that particular role, if I can't do that, I can't do anything.

27:05.715 --> 27:08.097
I mean, I go back to what you said earlier.

27:08.117 --> 27:13.163
You don't see where Jonathan saw the relevance of that particular.

27:14.476 --> 27:17.741
It makes perfect sense to me.

27:18.862 --> 27:21.987
I mean, because you really are looking for all of these.

27:22.007 --> 27:27.275
It's not just the marketplace, but it certainly goes like what kind of a book.

27:27.295 --> 27:38.691
I hesitate to use the word sells, but that's a P.O., outside of the Academy, which is really what Yale Press is trying to deal with.

27:38.711 --> 27:41.395
And in fact, within the Academy to be smart,

27:41.645 --> 27:43.528
I mean, I think you're right.

27:43.548 --> 27:45.791
I mean, that's certainly what caught Jonathan's eye.

27:46.252 --> 27:56.267
And I think it was, you know, I came to the press at a time when the press was really looking to ramp up its trade publishing program.

27:57.048 --> 28:00.533
So, you know, it was just, it was fortuitous.

28:01.435 --> 28:06.943
I think had I made that application maybe two or three years earlier,

28:07.717 --> 28:12.442
Maybe they would have asked me if I'd actually finished my Ph.D.

28:12.462 --> 28:14.504
work, and I hadn't.

28:16.627 --> 28:21.432
But I do have this, I do also have this, these scholarly interests.

28:21.452 --> 28:24.095
I mean, I was very much in that world for a while.

28:24.395 --> 28:28.459
Tell me what you do during a week.

28:28.479 --> 28:30.361
What's changing?

28:31.583 --> 28:33.825
Any idea of how it goes.

28:36.961 --> 28:40.965
I'm just afraid it's too terribly boring, even for the tape recorder.

28:41.746 --> 28:49.595
Well, these are things for my ears only, so it's just, you know.

28:49.875 --> 29:03.310
My day, a good part of my day is spent mostly moving projects forward through various stages of production.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.432
That's the not very glamorous.

29:06.087 --> 29:21.961
The interesting part of the job is strategizing about acquisitions, coming up with ideas for books, contacting authors, seeing if they're interested, calling up authors, seeing what they're working on.

29:25.864 --> 29:31.569
The acquisition strategy is a solitary thing that happens.

29:32.710 --> 29:35.352
It rarely happens in one's head.

29:36.580 --> 29:41.971
If you were to give me a percentage, agents must argue all the time with ideas.

29:42.712 --> 29:51.029
I'm different from most of the editors here in that, though I do deal with agents, most of my books come out of my head.

29:51.670 --> 29:52.612
Really?

29:52.632 --> 29:54.115
Really?

29:54.135 --> 29:54.736
Oh, I love that.

29:55.558 --> 29:58.504
Give me a couple of examples.

29:59.716 --> 30:04.663
Well, the first one being the playwrights one, for instance.

30:04.683 --> 30:06.386
That would be example number one.

30:06.406 --> 30:10.392
That's example number one, but let's just take the current catalog, if I look through.

30:13.577 --> 30:22.770
The Ivan Brunetti book, which is probably the book that we have in this particular catalog.

30:23.652 --> 30:28.018
Sure.

30:34.158 --> 30:40.444
pages 28 and 29, an anthology of graphic fiction, cartoons, and true stories.

30:42.085 --> 30:43.706
That's a project I commissioned.

30:43.967 --> 31:02.663
I contacted Ivan Brunetti, who is a well-known comic artist, and I asked him if he was interested in putting together an anthology that would both showcase some of North America's best

31:03.554 --> 31:12.425
comics, as well as providing, through its selections, a kind of history at the medium.

31:13.486 --> 31:22.737
And my model for this book was the McSweeney's volume that Chris Ware put together for McSweeney's.

31:22.757 --> 31:29.325
And that had sold 40,000 or 50,000 copies for McSweeney's.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.252
So that was very much on my radar screen.

31:32.272 --> 31:45.806
And I thought there was room for another one if the selection was done in a slightly different way, if it were a more generous selection that wanted to give a kind of history of the medium.

31:47.728 --> 31:49.950
So this is a fall book, right?

31:49.970 --> 31:50.571
It's a fall book.

31:52.273 --> 31:55.336
What was the extreme book again?

31:55.736 --> 31:57.338
I'll show you my copy right here.

32:00.490 --> 32:07.677
It has a ridiculous title, which you can't even see on the cover.

32:07.697 --> 32:08.538
Who publishes this?

32:08.858 --> 32:09.859
McSweeney's.

32:09.879 --> 32:10.580
McSweeney's.

32:11.000 --> 32:11.581
Who are they?

32:12.241 --> 32:15.945
McSweeney's is a publishing outfit that was started by Dave Eggers.

32:18.187 --> 32:19.609
It's an American publisher.

32:19.629 --> 32:20.029
Yeah.

32:20.049 --> 32:22.652
McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, issue number 13.

32:22.872 --> 32:27.576
An assorted sample of North American comic flying strips.

32:27.596 --> 32:29.198
That's all 40 to 50,000.

32:29.363 --> 32:30.204
Yeah, I think 50,000.

32:30.324 --> 32:32.086
I don't know it.

32:32.546 --> 32:35.509
How did that happen?

32:37.190 --> 32:41.314
It must be a terrific... Of course, people collect comic books, right?

32:42.435 --> 32:47.300
Dave Eggers founded the magazine McSweeney's.

32:47.940 --> 32:58.510
He also founded the publisher McSweeney's, and of course he's also the author of the memoir or novel, depending upon your point of view.

32:58.945 --> 33:04.089
called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.

33:04.209 --> 33:15.879
But almost all of the trade books that... Almost all of my trade books in the fall of six catalogs are ideas that came out of my head.

33:15.959 --> 33:17.160
And is this book going to be comics?

33:18.561 --> 33:19.502
The book that you're publishing?

33:20.183 --> 33:20.423
Yes.

33:20.823 --> 33:21.424
It's comics.

33:21.644 --> 33:22.265
That's correct.

33:22.285 --> 33:25.347
It's not text so much, it's comics.

33:25.367 --> 33:28.750
It's both text and it's both word and image.

33:29.253 --> 33:39.348
Depending upon whom you speak with, the so-called literary comic started maybe in the 60s or 70s.

33:40.350 --> 33:43.815
Some people would look to Art Spiegelman as one of the pioneers.

33:43.895 --> 33:47.461
Other people would point to a Pulitzer Prize winning book.

33:47.481 --> 33:50.245
Other people would point to Robert Crumb.

33:51.707 --> 33:56.374
But these are books that combine image and word in a sophisticated way.

33:57.181 --> 33:59.184
Arguably in a literary way.

33:59.344 --> 34:05.071
But that does bring it to the threshold of the university press, justifying it, I would imagine.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.356
How does it get into the catalog?

34:08.376 --> 34:10.899
How does it get into the mix?

34:11.099 --> 34:12.581
I made the argument this way.

34:12.942 --> 34:19.270
Look, Yale is an important publisher of art books.

34:19.290 --> 34:23.796
This is primarily, though not exclusively, a visual art.

34:24.535 --> 34:27.758
and tactile pleasure.

34:29.279 --> 34:33.563
And it's certainly in keeping with the long history of art books here.

34:34.044 --> 34:44.754
And moreover, the cartoon or the comic occupies a different place than it did at mid-century.

34:45.335 --> 34:50.840
The comic is no longer just something for the Sunday fun.

34:53.082 --> 34:54.323
So when you make

34:54.742 --> 34:57.485
You bring it to the publication?

34:57.625 --> 34:58.847
I bring it to the publication.

34:58.887 --> 34:59.848
And you've got to make this pitch.

35:00.929 --> 35:05.695
I bring it first to the acquisitions panel, and I make this pitch in kind of a similar way.

35:05.715 --> 35:06.857
And they say, okay.

35:08.358 --> 35:10.401
Do you have an author yet in mind for this?

35:11.662 --> 35:12.383
No, wait.

35:12.463 --> 35:14.506
Sometimes I don't even have an author in mind.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.387
Sometimes I do.

35:15.587 --> 35:16.508
Most often I do.

35:16.528 --> 35:22.836
I've had some kind of preliminary conversation and usually a thin proposal, which I'm bringing.

35:22.856 --> 35:24.478
So you contacted Brunetti?

35:24.644 --> 35:27.027
You proposed the idea.

35:27.288 --> 35:28.009
Right.

35:28.029 --> 35:28.810
You thought it was fabulous.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.372
I thought it was fabulous.

35:30.392 --> 35:31.594
And he said, great.

35:33.377 --> 35:37.383
And so now you have to bring it to your acquisitions committee.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.245
I bring it to the acquisitions panel.

35:39.666 --> 35:43.952
They say, great, offer him a contract.

35:46.776 --> 35:49.881
Well, so you offer the contract before you've got a publication.

35:49.901 --> 35:50.582
That's correct.

35:50.602 --> 35:51.143
I do that.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.845
For a book like this, I have to do that.

35:53.973 --> 35:55.495
for a trade book of his kind.

35:56.516 --> 36:01.641
So when you get to a publication committee, I mean, theoretically, they could reject it.

36:01.661 --> 36:02.602
They could reject it.

36:02.682 --> 36:10.990
So I have to be pretty confident that what I'm bringing forward is something that they'll accept.

36:11.110 --> 36:17.097
But those members of the publication committee of whom I've spoken said that never happens anyway as a practical matter.

36:17.117 --> 36:19.499
You have to trust your editors, is what they say.

36:19.519 --> 36:21.161
Yeah, I think that's right.

36:21.181 --> 36:23.423
And so again, this is all, you know,

36:23.808 --> 36:32.199
And the final analysis is that either we trust our editors and their judgment or we don't, you know.

36:32.219 --> 36:38.428
So, I mean, it's probably a 98% chance of that, unless it's so counter to everything that they believe in.

36:38.448 --> 36:39.149
I think that's right.

36:39.189 --> 36:43.314
I think you, I think it's an aspect of it.

36:43.334 --> 36:49.202
They might have questions on the screen, the direction that the book might be taking.

36:49.222 --> 36:50.524
They might want to see more.

36:51.432 --> 36:52.913
developed in other areas.

36:52.973 --> 36:59.099
But the committee tends to weigh in more heavily when it's something that's closer to home.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.823
That is to say when it's a scholarly project.

37:04.284 --> 37:17.956
And if the scholarship does not look up to snuff, if the scholarship seems odd in some way, then you will hear them weigh in very heavily.

37:17.976 --> 37:20.258
It doesn't mean that they'll

37:21.807 --> 37:32.342
quash the book, but it means that they may put it through a more rigorous peer review, or they may ask the editor to follow up in some way.

37:34.485 --> 37:38.270
But they tend to be more vocal about things that are posted down.

37:38.651 --> 37:40.053
I love that example, too.

37:40.073 --> 37:43.037
Can you give me one more?

37:43.057 --> 37:43.338
Sure.

37:43.398 --> 37:47.884
Complicity with Evil, which is also a fall book for us.

37:48.966 --> 37:50.147
Complicity with Evil?

37:50.307 --> 37:50.588
Yes.

37:50.608 --> 37:51.409
This is a book...

37:51.541 --> 37:56.207
on the United Nations and genocide.

38:00.533 --> 38:09.045
And that was a very late addition to our fall of six list, so late that you won't actually find a page for it in the book.

38:10.167 --> 38:11.889
It was sold outside the catalog.

38:13.231 --> 38:13.692
And the author?

38:13.832 --> 38:15.214
The author is Adam LeBor.

38:16.776 --> 38:17.176
How do you spell it?

38:17.537 --> 38:19.860
L-E, capital B-O-R.

38:21.157 --> 38:26.743
who is the Eastern European correspondent for the Times of London.

38:28.726 --> 38:41.901
And he wrote a highly praised book, Biography of Milosevic, which was published by Bloomsbury in the UK and by Yale here in the States.

38:43.243 --> 38:48.008
And he and I got to talking one night.

38:50.047 --> 39:01.721
He was telling me that he found it rather remarkable that Kofi Annan's career had taken off quite in the way that it had.

39:02.001 --> 39:19.902
After all, it was under Annan's watch, really, that the atrocities of Srebrenica and Rwanda had happened, partly under his watch.

39:21.215 --> 39:29.509
And, you know, he was elevated to the head of the World Organization.

39:30.692 --> 39:45.838
And then we began to talk in a more general way about how the institution of the UN itself might, both individuals and the institution, might be responsible.

39:46.072 --> 39:57.843
for some of the recent acts of genocide, including the Balkans, particularly Srebrenica, Rwanda, and now Darfur.

39:59.044 --> 40:11.516
And there are incredible parallels between, say, the atrocities of Srebrenica and Darfur, disturbing parallels.

40:12.537 --> 40:15.640
So would you regard this as a form of, this is a phrase that I heard from the

40:15.788 --> 40:21.397
for the first time, as a form of advocacy journalism, in one form or another?

40:21.417 --> 40:22.999
And it's certainly kind of a funny view, isn't it?

40:23.800 --> 40:28.367
It is a form, this book is a form of advocacy journalism, yeah.

40:28.488 --> 40:29.309
Scholarship.

40:29.329 --> 40:32.734
I'm not advocacy journalism, advocacy, scholarship is the phrase.

40:32.754 --> 40:36.360
Advocacy journalism, we don't know what that is.

40:36.380 --> 40:39.805
Advocacy, scholarship are the same.

40:40.510 --> 40:44.876
You know, I would not call this book a book of scholarship.

40:45.617 --> 40:47.199
The book is journalism.

40:47.659 --> 40:50.363
LeBor is a journalist by training.

40:50.543 --> 40:54.107
He was on the ground covering the Balkan Wars.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.955
He knows the history of the Balkan Wars as well as anybody.

41:01.977 --> 41:04.881
But it's reporting with...

41:05.418 --> 41:06.960
analysis, apparently.

41:07.140 --> 41:11.345
This is both reportage and argument.

41:13.067 --> 41:15.490
It is a political book.

41:15.530 --> 41:15.930
Which is?

41:16.231 --> 41:20.536
It's an attempt to motivate the public.

41:20.576 --> 41:32.830
It's an attempt to partly shame the world powers and the United Nations into taking some action in Darfur.

41:33.311 --> 41:35.053
So did it take a political...

41:35.455 --> 41:35.896
position?

41:37.017 --> 41:43.408
LeBor is not one of these critics who wants to get rid of the United Nations.

41:45.250 --> 41:55.006
He thinks it's the only thing that we have as a world organization that can intervene.

41:56.007 --> 41:56.949
When's his book publishing?

41:58.231 --> 41:58.672
October.

42:00.074 --> 42:02.037
I'll have to hear it.

42:02.405 --> 42:05.489
Is this the kind of thing that Yale stands to get some flack for?

42:07.531 --> 42:09.253
This book will be much reviewed.

42:10.535 --> 42:21.929
Of course, in December, Anand steps down from the United Nations, and a new secretary general will be appointed.

42:21.949 --> 42:26.013
So the publication intentionally coincides with these events.

42:27.675 --> 42:31.500
That is to say, as political observers and journalists

42:32.611 --> 42:39.742
are analyzing, assessing Anand's career, this book will have to enter into the discussion.

42:39.882 --> 42:41.645
That was very deliberate.

42:41.805 --> 42:44.669
When did University Presses do this before?

42:44.689 --> 42:51.219
This is not something that's historically something that the University Press is an institution.

42:51.239 --> 42:54.264
I think it's wonderful.

42:54.284 --> 42:56.046
It's different, isn't it?

42:56.066 --> 42:59.091
It's the kind of thing that the University Press has to do, I think, today.

42:59.442 --> 43:04.749
Yeah, I mean, maybe you would expect this from Random House or Simon and Schubert.

43:04.769 --> 43:07.693
Yeah, and I wouldn't bet, you know, who's publishing it?

43:07.713 --> 43:08.414
What difference is there?

43:08.434 --> 43:10.917
Could he come out with the EFSG or whoever?

43:11.237 --> 43:28.960
There were trade houses in their business that put books out there that are relevant and are going to be discussed by the University Preston with the question, because you're a not-for-profit, you know, moral business reflects some sort of political bias on the part of the university, which it doesn't.

43:29.125 --> 43:32.548
Or if it took a different position, would Neil do it?

43:32.608 --> 43:36.392
You know, these are the questions that I take normally, or not normally, but they could be asked.

43:37.373 --> 43:39.054
Am I wrong on that or not?

43:42.478 --> 43:47.282
This is not off the record, but this is now we're getting into a more delicate area.

43:47.302 --> 43:48.684
I mean, we're a university press.

43:48.704 --> 43:51.546
We do have a scholarly mission and a scholarly mandate.

43:52.888 --> 43:58.693
One needs to balance that with other things.

43:59.163 --> 44:16.989
It's not the first time I've heard this in other words, so don't feel that you're a lone ranger on this particular... I mean, certainly, to put it at the most abstract level, the most general level, I mean, you're balancing the trade list and the scholarly list.

44:17.349 --> 44:20.314
It really goes back to the way I see this book shaping up.

44:20.334 --> 44:26.082
It's what I call the Yale paradigm for success in university press publishing.

44:26.686 --> 44:29.109
It seems to me we have to have one look for the other.

44:29.149 --> 44:32.933
It's a somewhat artificial distinction.

44:35.736 --> 44:43.845
You know, with revisionist eyes, we tend to call anything that has sold well a trade book.

44:46.988 --> 44:56.659
But, you know, I would argue, for example, that... Well, while you're thinking, Princeton does a book called Bullshit,

44:57.972 --> 45:06.526
which is a little scholarly thing, but then it sells 85,000 or something copies, and now it's a trade blockbuster, and he's publishing with a trade press.

45:06.786 --> 45:10.492
It's got a book coming out this fall, but I don't even know what it is.

45:10.512 --> 45:13.737
It's clearly exploiting its success from the other people.

45:14.054 --> 45:14.795
That's a little book.

45:14.895 --> 45:16.697
That's kind of what you're saying, right?

45:16.817 --> 45:22.302
Yeah, I'll give you an even more extreme example, though.

45:23.763 --> 45:38.157
Say a book by... This is just an example that I'm pulling out of my head because I'm looking at it on my bookshelf, but Jeffrey Hartman's Criticism in the Wilderness.

45:38.177 --> 45:40.399
I mean, there's not anybody who will...

45:40.683 --> 45:48.995
argue with the fact that this is a scholarly book, but in its day it was a kind of best-seller, and, you know, we're reissuing it.

45:50.477 --> 46:05.998
A more recent example might be this annotated authoritative edition of Henry Davidson Rose Walden.

46:07.075 --> 46:12.062
This is a book with high scholarly ambitions.

46:13.344 --> 46:16.689
It is an authoritative text.

46:16.909 --> 46:18.972
It improves upon the Princeton text.

46:21.035 --> 46:32.492
The editor, Jeffrey Kramer, used as his copy text the first edition of Baldwin, the 1854 edition,

46:34.717 --> 46:43.865
But he also used, he also looked at the galleys surviving manuscripts.

46:43.925 --> 46:46.427
Not much of the Walden manuscript survived.

46:49.110 --> 46:56.236
And he also looked at Thoreau's marginal notes in his personal copy of Walden.

46:56.256 --> 47:02.682
So the idea was to put together the most authoritative text, most reliable text of Walden.

47:02.999 --> 47:04.181
Well, it's a work of scholarship.

47:04.201 --> 47:08.548
It's a work of scholarship, and you can see all the glossings that accompany this.

47:08.728 --> 47:12.515
It's expensive.

47:12.535 --> 47:17.142
I mean, when the Library of America does this, for instance, you get a nice text, you don't get any annotations.

47:17.183 --> 47:17.443
Right.

47:17.864 --> 47:20.508
Now, we published this on a trade discount.

47:21.189 --> 47:24.815
Now, you tell me, is this a trade book or is it a scholarly book?

47:24.835 --> 47:26.157
Well, you tell me what it sold.

47:27.259 --> 47:28.822
It sold 10,000 copies.

47:28.842 --> 47:29.563
It's a trade book.

47:30.927 --> 47:31.908
10,000 is pretty good.

47:32.029 --> 47:35.273
Maybe if it had sold 1,000 copies, we'd be calling it a scholarly book.

47:35.294 --> 47:36.615
Yeah, but you packaged it nicely.

47:37.156 --> 47:37.817
No, it's beautiful.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.061
No, it's a beautiful... You knew where you were going with this.

47:40.141 --> 47:41.703
I knew where I was going with this, yeah.

47:44.327 --> 47:45.529
And what was the first printing on it?

47:47.311 --> 47:51.898
The first printing on this was 5,000, and I had to argue for every single reprint.

47:52.980 --> 47:53.060
Wow.

47:53.080 --> 47:53.340
Really?

47:53.741 --> 47:57.667
Even after the... Even after... Even after selling, you still have to go to bed for the reprint?

47:58.128 --> 47:59.770
Still have to go... Auditors don't justify it?

48:02.180 --> 48:19.019
No, oddly they don't, because there's always the fear that, yes, though there are X number of back orders, they will evaporate, you know, just as we reprint, and there won't be any future orders.

48:19.039 --> 48:22.203
But in fact, this book has proven to be a steady, steady fellow.

48:22.223 --> 48:23.885
And it's 04, I think.

48:23.905 --> 48:24.706
I just noticed in the class.

48:24.726 --> 48:26.168
That's right.

48:26.188 --> 48:27.149
So it's been around.

48:27.169 --> 48:29.311
Have you put any paper yet, or is it still on the head?

48:29.371 --> 48:29.892
I have.

48:30.428 --> 48:38.255
Not quite this text in paperback, but I stripped the Walden text out from this book.

48:38.276 --> 48:47.004
That is to say, Thoreau's text minus all of the scholarly apparatus and minus all of the annotations.

48:47.024 --> 48:49.046
Yeah, but that's what makes the book.

48:49.066 --> 48:49.306
Right.

48:49.546 --> 48:54.391
That's why it's more of a spin-off than it is a paperback edition of the annotated Walden.

48:54.411 --> 48:57.814
My point is, and let's still be selling pretty decently in hardcover.

48:58.014 --> 48:59.095
Oh, yeah.

48:59.176 --> 48:59.676
Absolutely.

49:00.820 --> 49:02.683
and then replication of it in paper.

49:02.703 --> 49:03.544
That's exactly right.

49:03.604 --> 49:07.189
I think they will do at some point for students and for classes.

49:07.209 --> 49:11.995
I'm supposed to meet Tina at about 30, so I'd like to go on.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.377
This is really good.

49:13.397 --> 49:14.138
Thank you.

49:14.158 --> 49:14.358
Yeah.

49:14.378 --> 49:15.460
Can we continue, perhaps?

49:15.981 --> 49:16.461
If you like.

49:17.843 --> 49:20.046
Let me transcribe this at home.

49:21.048 --> 49:25.073
Very good.

49:25.492 --> 49:27.835
I've asked everybody this question, so I should ask you.

49:27.855 --> 49:30.598
By the way, you showed me The Iceman Cometh by Eugene O'Neill.

49:30.618 --> 49:31.479
Two quick questions.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.642
Do you think the University Press should be publishing fiction?

49:38.166 --> 49:41.209
You'd be surprised I had a variety of responses to that.

49:41.710 --> 49:43.112
I don't think that they shouldn't.

49:44.873 --> 49:52.562
Whether or not Yale should... And by that, I mean you're going out to get novelists the way, you know, the way you did when...

49:53.082 --> 49:56.145
I would probably say this.

49:56.285 --> 50:07.837
In the case of Yale University Press, it would make sense for us to venture into the area of contemporary fiction if we understand that to mean important translations.

50:08.999 --> 50:12.122
Which is what John has in mind for another project that he's doing.

50:12.142 --> 50:20.811
Yeah, but I don't think that Yale University Press should be in the business of trying to find

50:22.158 --> 50:24.241
the next literary superstar.

50:24.942 --> 50:27.285
LSU does this occasional fiction, I know.

50:28.227 --> 50:29.428
Some places do.

50:29.448 --> 50:30.370
Some places do.

50:30.891 --> 50:36.018
I happen to think that that's one area where university presses cannot compete very well.

50:36.058 --> 50:40.264
And there are so many other places doing it.

50:40.344 --> 50:40.825
Why?

50:41.005 --> 50:41.786
And doing it well.

50:41.906 --> 50:42.347
So why?

50:42.367 --> 50:44.750
What they aren't doing is poetry and drama.

50:44.770 --> 50:46.813
What they aren't doing is poetry, drama.

50:47.094 --> 50:48.275
So that's good.

50:48.296 --> 50:48.956
That answers that.

50:49.037 --> 50:50.038
And then quickly,

50:50.677 --> 50:57.126
Because I've asked everybody this question, what would you like to see covered?

50:57.146 --> 51:05.739
What would you like to read about your university press in a little celebration or an evaluation of this particular institution?

51:05.759 --> 51:11.827
What is it that you don't know about this place that you'd like to know about it?

51:11.908 --> 51:15.813
Of the 20 different people I've asked this question, I've had 20 different answers.

51:15.833 --> 51:17.055
Did anybody say, I don't know?

51:17.812 --> 51:18.593
That's good, too.

51:20.176 --> 51:23.461
Would you just be interested in seeing what I come up with, I suppose?

51:24.142 --> 51:28.049
I'm very curious to see the shape of the narrative.

51:28.509 --> 51:35.681
It's going to be interesting, because it's going to be kind of chronological, but that's boring.

51:35.741 --> 51:37.925
There's really three big phases here.

51:38.085 --> 51:43.093
And I'm curious to see how you adjudicate all of the competing voices, because

51:44.322 --> 51:45.804
It's certainly not a chorus.

51:46.204 --> 51:47.526
There it is right there.

51:47.646 --> 51:49.448
There's your contribution to this, by the way.

51:49.468 --> 51:49.708
Go ahead.

51:49.768 --> 51:51.190
Continue right now.

51:51.250 --> 51:52.831
It's not a chorus.

51:53.112 --> 51:55.615
It's more like... Oh, forget me.

51:56.155 --> 52:04.124
It's more like 10 or 12 different barkers selling something different and all competing for your attention.

52:04.344 --> 52:05.546
Well, it's kind of fun.

52:05.726 --> 52:06.346
That's my job.

52:06.667 --> 52:07.107
I better go.

52:07.127 --> 52:08.869
Tina's probably thought I'd disappear.

52:10.291 --> 52:10.431
Gotcha.
