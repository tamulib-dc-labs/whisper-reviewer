WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:03.528
Oh, no.

00:03.588 --> 00:08.813
And, of course, one of the reasons they... We'll go back on again.

00:08.973 --> 00:14.399
But, I mean, you might just... In chatting with them, bring up her name.

00:14.419 --> 00:15.560
No, no, no, no, no.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.102
I will let it alone.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.364
At some point, it's going to be public.

00:19.425 --> 00:23.229
At some point, it'll come out somewhere in a story about them.

00:23.469 --> 00:25.931
See, they know I'm here today, number one.

00:26.032 --> 00:26.732
No, no, no.

00:26.752 --> 00:28.514
And number two, they know I know about Ariana.

00:28.594 --> 00:29.295
Nick, Nick.

00:30.271 --> 00:34.036
I ain't going to ever mention it to them until I first see it in print.

00:34.056 --> 00:35.999
Okay, good.

00:36.219 --> 00:37.361
Okay, okay.

00:37.661 --> 00:39.864
But it's an amusing little tinder, isn't it?

00:39.884 --> 00:42.107
They've got every right-winger in the country.

00:42.168 --> 00:44.911
She's just one more nodding.

00:44.931 --> 00:47.615
Yeah, they've got the whole bloody gallery of them.

00:47.635 --> 00:51.180
Red travels around, you know.

00:51.541 --> 00:55.566
And I'm sure that's why Lynn went to Washington to speak about the new thing.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.270
I think Glenn distanced himself a little bit from that.

00:58.655 --> 01:08.566
Because the word they put out was that Lynn was... Lynn was... Yeah, I know they put out the word, but it ain't true.

01:08.746 --> 01:23.883
In fact, the only... Glenn was here yesterday visiting us and bringing us some nice tomatoes, which he'd grown, and... the only harsh moment came when I said joyfully, well, we're up 15 points above you again.

01:23.923 --> 01:25.364
We're certainly going to win the election.

01:25.384 --> 01:28.628
And Glenn's face got very dark, and he said, no, he said...

01:28.912 --> 01:35.162
Because Kenneth Starr is going to come out with the real stuff, and we're going to indict him in Hillary.

01:35.643 --> 01:38.908
We're going to.

01:38.928 --> 01:42.634
And Kenneth Starr is about as much of an assassin as I've ever seen in my life.

01:42.854 --> 01:44.577
My dear, they are all a pack of fascists.

01:45.218 --> 01:46.239
Even our dear friends.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.181
Never mind.

01:47.361 --> 01:47.882
Never mind.

01:48.062 --> 01:49.224
But that's politics.

01:49.344 --> 01:49.805
All right.

01:49.845 --> 01:50.446
That's politics.

01:50.466 --> 01:51.788
Yes.

01:51.808 --> 01:54.312
If you'd like, and I'll say this while the tape is running, um,

01:54.848 --> 02:01.727
I'd be more than happy for the book now, not for the column, but would you like me to run your quotes by you before I use them for this book?

02:02.850 --> 02:04.454
The context will be beautiful.

02:04.534 --> 02:06.118
I'm in your corner.

02:06.179 --> 02:07.302
Nicholas, I trust you.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.347
You don't have to write anything by me.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.372
I mean, I too am fearful.

02:11.493 --> 02:17.340
I'd like, when the column comes out, because I might not run into it otherwise, I'd like to send it to me.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.404
And when the book comes out, Glenn will send me a copy anyway.

02:20.624 --> 02:22.988
Okay, but you feel comfortable with my doing?

02:23.008 --> 02:23.728
Perfectly comfortable.

02:23.748 --> 02:24.650
You don't have to check any.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.031
This book will be published in 1999.

02:26.172 --> 02:32.019
It's going to be books, book culture, the relevance of the text, where we're going.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.862
And you mentioned information.

02:33.922 --> 02:36.465
Now, this is being touted as the information agent.

02:37.373 --> 02:39.255
Oh, it's a horrible idea.

02:39.275 --> 02:39.976
What is information?

02:40.436 --> 02:41.577
Information is data.

02:41.597 --> 02:42.818
That's all a computer does.

02:43.239 --> 02:53.489
The best thing about, quote that marvelous moment in John Ashbery's great poem, Soonest Mended, where he asked, was it information?

02:55.331 --> 02:56.772
Of course, that's always the question.

02:56.873 --> 02:57.954
Was it information?

02:58.014 --> 02:59.635
That's excellent.

03:00.736 --> 03:01.077
That's wonderful.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.600
Look at the poem called Soonest Mended by John Ashbery.

03:04.620 --> 03:05.741
I've heard all of Ashbery as well.

03:05.781 --> 03:07.363
Terrific poem.

03:08.204 --> 03:10.808
But it goes back to information.

03:10.888 --> 03:12.450
So what is information?

03:13.631 --> 03:14.553
Is it wisdom?

03:14.653 --> 03:15.414
Is it knowledge?

03:15.634 --> 03:16.716
It's not knowledge, is it?

03:16.736 --> 03:19.780
I mean, you don't fool around with a computer, do you?

03:19.800 --> 03:20.721
You don't download it.

03:20.741 --> 03:25.788
Well, as I said in this book, information is a parody of gnosis.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.973
You know, gnosis is knowing.

03:30.254 --> 03:31.475
Gnosis is wisdom.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.897
It's a wonderful Greek word.

03:32.957 --> 03:33.979
I'm Greek.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.040
Yes, I know.

03:35.321 --> 03:37.063
It is very much a Greek name.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.069
Including the Nicholas.

03:42.312 --> 03:43.554
You look tired today.

03:44.174 --> 03:45.597
Oh, I'm always tired, my dear.

03:46.618 --> 03:48.541
Do you still suffer from insomnia?

03:49.001 --> 03:51.805
Oh, I had a terrible night last night.

03:51.825 --> 03:53.207
I'm a terrible non-sleeper.

03:54.349 --> 03:58.755
And I was sad, too, because I go back to work next week.

03:58.795 --> 04:04.063
Wednesday's my first class, but my wife, who works as a school psychologist out in Brantford, Connecticut...

04:05.630 --> 04:08.034
I've been so used to her company these last eight weeks.

04:08.054 --> 04:09.456
She went back to work today.

04:09.997 --> 04:14.084
So I'm sad about that.

04:14.324 --> 04:17.790
Also, the New York Yankees are self-destroying.

04:17.810 --> 04:19.413
The Red Sox are on their way.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.254
Yes, I know.

04:20.294 --> 04:24.341
I adored them this summer, and all of a sudden I looked, and they're only four games behind the Yankees.

04:24.501 --> 04:28.127
The Yankees are in a state of...

04:28.411 --> 04:30.975
The Red Sox are caught up to Baltimore, eh?

04:31.155 --> 04:34.500
They're just two games behind Baltimore and four behind the Yankees.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.763
No, Baltimore's four behind the Yankees.

04:36.803 --> 04:39.247
The Red Sox this morning, it's only four games.

04:39.267 --> 04:40.769
The Yankees are self-destructing.

04:40.789 --> 04:44.034
The Yankees are self-destructing, but they're still four ahead of Baltimore.

04:44.675 --> 04:45.336
That could be.

04:45.356 --> 04:47.199
Okay, the Red Sox are two behind Baltimore.

04:47.219 --> 04:48.541
So they're six behind us.

04:48.961 --> 04:51.305
But the way things are going, the Yankees are not going to win.

04:52.447 --> 04:54.049
They're not even going to be a wild card.

04:54.850 --> 04:56.072
Four games is a...

04:56.255 --> 04:59.359
But we've played them the last eight days of the season.

04:59.480 --> 04:59.780
That's right.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.783
And that's where it's all going to come together, right?

05:01.943 --> 05:02.964
Well, it may come together.

05:02.984 --> 05:05.147
There are three more games between the Yanks and Baltimore.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.891
But on the other hand, Mr. Cullen is returning.

05:08.232 --> 05:08.833
He is.

05:09.373 --> 05:10.054
Our savior.

05:10.395 --> 05:12.237
We have Mr. Ken Sinkle coming back.

05:12.798 --> 05:16.503
But Clemens has been pitching very well.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.905
Clemens has been pitching well.

05:17.925 --> 05:23.393
But if Mr. Cullen comes back and can pitch every fifth day, then we have a chance.

05:23.795 --> 05:26.439
I did an interview two weeks ago with Stephen Jay Gould.

05:26.499 --> 05:27.901
He has a home now in Soho.

05:28.101 --> 05:29.783
Yes, yes, yes.

05:30.184 --> 05:31.065
Very far away.

05:31.085 --> 05:32.107
Very interesting man.

05:32.127 --> 05:33.529
Yes, an interesting fellow.

05:33.549 --> 05:41.540
And I go into his room, his reading room, his library, and he has seven inscribed baseballs over there.

05:41.620 --> 05:47.308
He has two Joe DiMaggio's, two Mickey Mantle's, and Hank Aaron.

05:47.328 --> 05:49.411
He must be as sad at the moment as I am.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.513
He sounds like an anxious man.

05:50.553 --> 05:51.274
That was two weeks ago.

05:51.294 --> 05:52.215
He was riding high.

05:52.415 --> 05:56.723
Oh, I have felt it coming for four weeks now.

05:57.223 --> 05:58.425
They have not been playing.

05:58.446 --> 05:58.646
No.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.269
They're falling apart.

06:00.289 --> 06:02.993
And Torrey looks more... Let's change the subject.

06:03.214 --> 06:03.755
Okay.

06:03.815 --> 06:07.221
I'll just tell you the seventh baseball that he has, which I love.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.483
He has a wealth ranker.

06:09.020 --> 06:16.953
I said, oh, boy, that's what I wouldn't give to owner Ralph Branca and a Billy Buckner, you know.

06:17.454 --> 06:19.477
The two famous bad villains.

06:19.497 --> 06:26.067
Yeah, but of course, he said, well, the Branca would be better if Bobby Thompson had signed it, too, and it would be if you're thinking about it.

06:26.087 --> 06:26.628
Anyway, baseball.

06:26.688 --> 06:27.650
We're going off in baseball.

06:27.850 --> 06:28.832
You know, you were mentioning these.

06:29.132 --> 06:31.416
You certainly are, for as much as you read,

06:38.213 --> 06:41.758
You remain an astute observer of social behavior.

06:42.199 --> 06:47.526
You mentioned things like the near-death experience and this new age stuff that people are talking about.

06:47.546 --> 06:49.750
You mentioned rock and roll and MTV.

06:51.071 --> 06:56.559
You must maintain a pretty observant eye about what's social.

06:56.619 --> 07:02.708
I mean, I know sometimes people can see you, perceive you as the absent-minded professor, you know.

07:03.069 --> 07:05.853
I have in many ways absent.

07:05.953 --> 07:07.495
Why is it about to know?

07:07.880 --> 07:17.773
falling downstairs or forgetting to do something I'm supposed to do and so on, but I'm pretty well aware where we live and as we live and what is going on.

07:17.953 --> 07:19.335
It is appalling.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.458
Which is almost part of the curse, isn't it?

07:21.518 --> 07:23.501
Because you can see where we're going.

07:23.521 --> 07:25.303
Oh, we are.

07:25.944 --> 07:34.275
I mean, I'm going to vote for Clinton for dear life, even though I loathe that welfare signing, because he's all we've got against these monsters.

07:34.677 --> 07:42.666
The idea of having a Republican Congress and Senate and Bob Dole, we're going to go even faster.

07:42.966 --> 07:44.107
I can tell you where we're going.

07:44.248 --> 07:45.889
I think we're going to have wealthier riots.

07:46.871 --> 07:50.374
I think we're going to have ungovernable inner cities.

07:51.896 --> 07:53.218
In fact, I see a show in that book.

07:53.758 --> 07:54.759
You say that.

07:55.300 --> 07:59.705
You actually anticipate this whole bill that was signed to a week ago.

07:59.725 --> 08:01.647
Yeah, and I didn't know anything about it at all.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.902
No, I prophesy on that.

08:03.982 --> 08:06.605
How do you look at a kid and say, we're not going to feed you anymore?

08:07.666 --> 08:08.267
A little kid.

08:08.948 --> 08:10.069
We're not going to give you medicine.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.692
Under Reagan, TB came back.

08:12.912 --> 08:13.773
What are you talking about?

08:14.133 --> 08:24.765
That swine Pete Wilson in California happily signed an executive order for the state of California based on the federal welfare bill that our slick willy has just signed.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.467
I saw this yesterday.

08:26.507 --> 08:31.633
He was signing the ordinance on the basis of which...

08:32.457 --> 08:39.386
medicine will be denied, medical care will be denied to the children of illegal immigrants, and they're going to be thrown out of school.

08:39.767 --> 08:44.473
They're not going to be taken into school in a day or two when they start up in California.

08:45.814 --> 08:47.577
Amazing.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.661
And if they get sick, they're going to be allowed to die.

08:50.681 --> 08:59.292
And the fascist Republican platform, which the Emily Dole says he hasn't read, calls for

09:01.229 --> 09:10.821
Children born on United States soil who are the children of illegal immigrants are not to be considered American citizens.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.904
Does that sound constitutional?

09:12.924 --> 09:28.803
This is a proposed amendment to the Constitution, just as the making abortion a crime is a proposed... What they intend to do is repeal the Bill of Rights, and they intend to repeal... Of course, they want to keep the gun provision in there.

09:28.924 --> 09:30.105
If they had their way...

09:30.524 --> 09:35.009
Every Republican in the country would have his or her own 50-caliber machine gun.

09:35.630 --> 09:38.594
And if you or I insult her Ariana, she would cut us down.

09:38.874 --> 09:40.876
I'm sure, with an Uzi.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.558
She's probably quite adept at using.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.721
They're all gun nuts.

09:47.845 --> 09:50.648
Let's get back into it.

09:50.668 --> 09:53.992
Philip Ratha, who you... Philip is a close personal friend.

09:54.012 --> 09:58.337
And at this moment, setting a few poets aside...

09:58.722 --> 10:01.065
Philip is, I think, the best writer in this country.

10:01.205 --> 10:17.325
I have just read, it's over there on the couch, his new novel called American Pastel, which is a very sad and beautiful novel, which he sent me in manuscript, and which is a remarkable departure for him.

10:17.345 --> 10:26.637
He has, as I understand it, he has profound attitudes about how many legitimate and genuine readers there are.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.225
Philip and I have had many conversations about this.

10:30.305 --> 10:31.566
Philip always shocks me.

10:32.668 --> 10:47.049
I told him once, Philip, when we were having dinner, I said, you sound to me like the editor of the old forwards, you know, the Yiddish newspaper, who couldn't bear to read the obituaries because he was losing readers all the time and they couldn't be replaced.

10:47.089 --> 10:49.312
Philip says, Harold, that's exactly the way I feel.

10:49.372 --> 10:53.839
I feel that as my readers die, they are not being replaced.

10:54.663 --> 10:58.930
that there are fewer and fewer people who are truly literate in the United States.

11:00.713 --> 11:04.579
Do you subscribe to this whole dumbing down phrase?

11:05.180 --> 11:06.082
No.

11:06.142 --> 11:09.387
I dislike the phrase in the extreme.

11:10.509 --> 11:13.634
I don't think that we're seeing the dumbing of America.

11:14.616 --> 11:21.447
I think we are seeing the betrayal of civilized literacy

11:22.844 --> 11:32.294
and aesthetic and intellectual standards by the two groups of people who were supposed to protect it.

11:32.975 --> 11:43.205
On the one hand, the university teachers in the humanities, and on the other hand, the supposedly upper-level journalists of the New York Times variety.

11:43.225 --> 11:45.407
I think the two groups have sold out together.

11:45.988 --> 11:46.629
They've sold out?

11:46.989 --> 11:47.890
Yeah, they've sold out.

11:48.899 --> 11:51.802
They've sold out to what they feel makes them fashionable.

11:52.002 --> 11:56.066
They've sold out to so-called multiculturalism.

11:56.186 --> 12:08.579
They've sold out to... The real enemy of what I'm talking about in that book, though I only use the phrase once or twice, is rock religion.

12:10.020 --> 12:17.488
As I say in the book, there was a very brief moment about 1968 or 69...

12:18.194 --> 12:23.880
When what was going on, you know, with the onion rock really was a kind of religious frenzy.

12:24.701 --> 12:32.190
And the moment passed, and it simply became a kind of mechanical reproduction, which is what they've got now.

12:33.031 --> 12:44.023
I think there was something there which tapped into some of the deep roots of American religion.

12:44.624 --> 12:47.307
But what we have now is just so deplorable.

12:47.827 --> 13:03.907
I hope you don't mind my jumping around, but you mentioned in other previous interviews that this journey that you've been on, and I wonder how this new book, where this fits in.

13:03.927 --> 13:08.292
I am writing, what you see all around you is a vast book on Shakespeare.

13:08.332 --> 13:13.699
This is the book I've always wanted to write, and this is my magnum of this,

13:14.405 --> 13:22.873
This is for Riverhead Putnam, the same people who did the paperback of the Western canon who have just published, or were the moment published, God willing.

13:23.674 --> 13:27.398
Omens of Millennium is a book called The Invention of the Human.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.500
The Invention of the Human.

13:30.501 --> 13:44.395
Characters of Shakespeare's plays, and it would be 1,000 pages long, and will be an attempt to get back to the study of character as being what is crucial in Shakespeare's invention of us as we are now.

13:45.117 --> 13:49.944
And it will be a defense of the idea of talking about Shakespearean character.

13:50.865 --> 14:02.161
And it will be in dissent against everything that now goes on in writing about teaching and even acting Shakespeare, because I think we are debasing Shakespeare in the most hideous kind of a way.

14:02.201 --> 14:07.529
And you're going to talk about a journey.

14:07.809 --> 14:10.273
I think that ends me on the literary side.

14:10.513 --> 14:14.078
I don't think when I finish this book in progress...

14:15.138 --> 14:17.801
I think my work as a literary critic will be done.

14:17.841 --> 14:26.532
I still feel that I have work to do as a religious critic, as I call it, but I can't at the moment say where I will go with it.

14:27.053 --> 14:27.574
I don't know.

14:27.594 --> 14:39.188
A lot depends upon whether or not there is an intelligent reaction to this Omens of Millennium book.

14:40.315 --> 14:41.777
which I really do not expect.

14:41.917 --> 14:48.025
I mean, I know there have been two or three intelligent ones already, and clearly you are a highly sensitive and intelligent reaction to it.

14:48.826 --> 14:56.477
And maybe I'll get three or four more, but I think in general I will not get understanding for it.

14:57.218 --> 15:00.602
The good news about my piece is that it now runs in 25 newspapers.

15:01.983 --> 15:03.625
and largely university.

15:03.645 --> 15:04.926
I've syndicated myself.

15:05.187 --> 15:07.489
You live in Worcester, my dear.

15:07.669 --> 15:09.592
Grafton, which is right next to Worcester.

15:09.712 --> 15:12.675
Oh, that means you get to go to that nice art museum, the Clarke.

15:13.096 --> 15:16.119
The Worcester Art Museum, which is wonderful.

15:16.139 --> 15:18.922
Well, I thought that was affiliated to Clarke University.

15:18.942 --> 15:21.685
No, actually it's where you're on.

15:21.705 --> 15:22.767
Isn't Clarke in Worcester?

15:23.067 --> 15:23.908
Clarke is.

15:24.268 --> 15:25.830
Doesn't Clarke have an art gallery?

15:26.502 --> 15:31.129
I've mixed up the two.

15:31.149 --> 15:32.612
I always sort of belonged to Clark.

15:32.792 --> 15:32.952
No.

15:33.052 --> 15:36.417
In fact, I'm the immediate past president of the Friends of the Library, Clark.

15:36.437 --> 15:36.758
I see.

15:37.018 --> 15:40.324
I never went to Clark, but I always say that.

15:40.464 --> 15:41.986
I see.

15:42.006 --> 15:42.847
You have to help books.

15:42.887 --> 15:49.017
But the American Antiquariate Society is in Worcester, which is a very important repository

15:49.469 --> 15:51.251
Your family is in Worcester?

15:51.651 --> 15:56.397
My family, most of the Greeks who came to this country went to Lowell, believe it or not.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.298
I know that, yes.

15:57.318 --> 15:59.700
And so I grew up in Lowell, actually.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.181
I see.

16:00.201 --> 16:02.243
But my parents are there.

16:02.283 --> 16:04.165
My father is 85 now.

16:04.185 --> 16:04.726
God bless him.

16:05.847 --> 16:07.169
You would be about 50?

16:07.790 --> 16:08.570
I'm 53.

16:08.991 --> 16:09.932
Oh, you're a little bear.

16:11.053 --> 16:11.233
I'm 66.

16:11.293 --> 16:14.577
Time marches on.

16:14.617 --> 16:15.358
Do you have siblings?

16:21.650 --> 16:23.613
Your mama, alas, is gone.

16:23.633 --> 16:24.254
No, my mother is.

16:24.374 --> 16:24.915
Oh, good.

16:24.935 --> 16:25.897
Oh, good.

16:25.917 --> 16:26.999
Oh, good.

16:27.099 --> 16:29.402
Vigorous, travels, continues to travel.

16:29.422 --> 16:29.763
Oh, good.

16:29.883 --> 16:30.725
How old is mama?

16:31.065 --> 16:32.087
She's 75.

16:32.648 --> 16:35.432
Oh, much younger than papa.

16:36.354 --> 16:38.818
But I'm nine years older than my wife.

16:39.579 --> 16:40.440
It happens.

16:40.460 --> 16:41.923
Do you have children?

16:41.943 --> 16:42.483
Two daughters.

16:42.944 --> 16:43.625
How old are they?

16:43.866 --> 16:48.433
They are 15 and 13, and they are wonderful readers.

16:48.886 --> 16:50.287
I see how wonderful.

16:50.788 --> 16:52.910
They may be the last readers, my dear.

16:53.030 --> 16:56.514
And they read twice as fast as I do.

16:57.635 --> 17:05.864
When I read how you can do four or five hundred or six hundred pages an hour, I'm in awe of that.

17:05.884 --> 17:11.149
I'm a much slower reader, but I'm a very appreciative and thorough reader.

17:11.610 --> 17:16.395
I have to say, even though it's a steady pace, I can accelerate it if I have to.

17:16.848 --> 17:19.912
I can do maybe 100, 200 pages an hour if I have to.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.636
But I would much rather take it, it's like reading Shakespeare.

17:23.716 --> 17:26.239
Who wants to speed read Shakespeare?

17:26.259 --> 17:28.341
You can't tell me you speed read Shakespeare.

17:28.362 --> 17:29.883
No, no, no.

17:29.903 --> 17:31.385
But I know it all by heart anyway.

17:31.405 --> 17:31.926
You know it all by heart.

17:32.446 --> 17:33.127
It doesn't matter.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.849
Even the obscure plays?

17:35.290 --> 17:35.730
Oh, sure.

17:35.910 --> 17:38.714
I've taught all 38 of them again and again.

17:38.754 --> 17:41.497
For the last 12 years, I've done nothing to teach Shakespeare.

17:43.499 --> 17:44.400
That is absolute.

17:44.420 --> 17:45.842
So I'm very deep in all of them.

17:46.480 --> 17:56.314
And, you know, I've been... This last year I've been writing very hard about Shakespeare all the time, and I will spend the next year writing very hard about it.

17:56.374 --> 17:58.657
Whether I'll finish on time or not, I don't know.

17:59.238 --> 18:02.182
I'd like to have this finished a year from now, but I may not be able to.

18:02.783 --> 18:12.457
I know I asked you the last time... I know it's an unfair question, but it's the famous Desert Island question.

18:12.477 --> 18:13.078
Shakespeare...

18:13.683 --> 18:14.544
Is the answer?

18:14.564 --> 18:15.004
Shakespeare.

18:15.145 --> 18:19.729
Shakespeare, and then for a second book, yeah, I would choose.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.954
In fact, it would be hard to choose between the Hebrew Bible and the King James.

18:24.955 --> 18:26.536
It would be a very difficult choice.

18:26.616 --> 18:27.938
I guess I would want all three.

18:27.998 --> 18:30.781
I guess I'd want a text of the Hebrew Bible.

18:31.582 --> 18:34.725
I would want the King James Bible, and I would want Shakespeare.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.807
I guess those would be the three books.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.690
If I could have a fourth, I would want a Dante.

18:41.155 --> 18:43.377
If I could have a fifth, I would want Cervantes.

18:43.518 --> 18:45.259
After that, it would be very hard to say.

18:45.300 --> 18:52.988
Are there any books that you haven't read that you would want, that you just haven't had time to read?

18:53.008 --> 18:55.671
Have you basically read everything that you feel you want?

18:55.691 --> 19:07.804
There's a wonderful line of Malamés, which is best translated as, The flesh is sad, alas, and I have read all the books.

19:10.433 --> 19:13.837
The flesh is sad, alas, and I have read all the books.

19:14.678 --> 19:15.879
And you have read them all.

19:15.899 --> 19:17.321
I think I have read all the books.

19:18.022 --> 19:20.244
But by now I've re-read all the books.

19:20.324 --> 19:22.447
I've done nothing but read, and I go on reading.

19:22.767 --> 19:25.971
And I re-read things all the time.

19:26.211 --> 19:27.993
I mean, I re-read Shakespeare daily.

19:29.174 --> 19:32.598
I recite poems to myself all the time, anyway, as I walk around.

19:32.658 --> 19:38.685
After you go today, I will go on my Constitutional, and I will just recite poems to myself as I go...

19:39.560 --> 19:46.347
Do you have any thoughts on the American novel as we approach this next millennium?

19:46.367 --> 19:46.907
Oh, sure.

19:47.147 --> 19:49.370
I think Philip is the best we have right now.

19:49.750 --> 19:58.539
We had a fascinating, epic narrative writer, I wouldn't quite call him a novelist, and Thomas Pynchon, but he's gone to hell.

19:58.719 --> 20:08.048
I mean, there was the splendid of somewhat juvenile V, and it was a brilliant short novel, The Crime of Life, 49,

20:08.602 --> 20:14.733
Then there was the extraordinary prose epic, almost a sort of Moby Dick of our time, Gravity's Rainbow.

20:14.753 --> 20:22.546
But then came a long silence, and then he produced a piece of absolute garbage, which I frequently can't believe he actually wrote.

20:22.907 --> 20:24.109
Somebody else must have written it.

20:24.329 --> 20:26.813
Yeah, it was.

20:26.854 --> 20:28.496
I couldn't believe it.

20:29.458 --> 20:30.279
I read through it.

20:30.299 --> 20:34.086
I couldn't find a phrase, a redeeming sentence, a redeeming moment.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.032
And he's been silent since.

20:36.092 --> 20:38.075
He seems to be a complete burned-out case.

20:38.135 --> 20:39.457
I don't know what happened to him.

20:39.477 --> 20:42.040
It's quite reclusive, as I understand it.

20:42.060 --> 20:42.221
No.

20:42.421 --> 20:43.382
He's published by Hope.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.924
We have the same... No.

20:45.926 --> 20:46.927
We don't have the same editor.

20:47.168 --> 20:50.653
Whereas Roth, I must say, has gone from strength to strength.

20:50.853 --> 20:53.697
I find amazing what Philip Roth has been able to do.

20:53.717 --> 21:02.529
This is quite a side from any personal feeling I have for the man, and we are good friends, but I think we became good friends because I liked the work so much.

21:02.870 --> 21:03.010
Um,

21:05.116 --> 21:09.863
The four Zuckerman novels, Ending in the Prague Orgy, are marvelous.

21:10.884 --> 21:16.532
And then came The Counter-Life, and then came the wonderful memoir, The Patrimony.

21:17.774 --> 21:26.466
And then came that shockingly powerful book called Sabbath's Theater, and now this extraordinary, immensely sad book called American Pastoral.

21:27.107 --> 21:29.791
I think Philip is probably the best we've got right now.

21:31.013 --> 21:32.575
And if you were to describe a

21:32.909 --> 21:35.352
I mean, can you articulate what it is?

21:35.472 --> 21:36.874
Yeah, painful laughter.

21:38.056 --> 21:58.222
The extraordinary, sort of morally painful laughter, a laughter which is so profoundly offended by what we have done to ourselves and what our society has done to itself and what life itself seems to do to itself.

21:58.262 --> 22:02.528
It's a kind of...

22:02.845 --> 22:06.588
comic art carried almost to the point of hysteria.

22:07.569 --> 22:10.692
It's quite frightening in its implications.

22:10.712 --> 22:14.816
And you see him improving, basically.

22:14.836 --> 22:20.862
Philip amazes me because each book has been better than the one before, and now they're getting more and more different.

22:20.902 --> 22:29.710
Sabbath Theatre had nothing in common with the previous work, and this American Pastoral has nothing in common with Sabbath Theatre or with Operation Shylock, which I thought was a wonderful book.

22:30.510 --> 22:31.131
This is

22:31.685 --> 22:32.767
Completely different.

22:32.787 --> 22:35.831
It's got a sympathetic hero, though a tragic one.

22:36.051 --> 22:58.182
Poor fellow who's a glove manufacturer in New Jersey who has nothing in common with Roth, nothing in common with these Zuckerman figures of any sort, and who is a victim of the 60s because his life is basically destroyed by his daughter, who becomes one of those weatherwomen bomb manufacturers and throwers.

22:59.191 --> 23:01.494
You know, it just turns him inside out.

23:01.534 --> 23:03.858
It's just scary.

23:04.058 --> 23:10.768
And yet, in the midst of it, there's still that terrible, painful laughter that rises up.

23:10.948 --> 23:13.552
It's quite extraordinary.

23:14.353 --> 23:21.243
You have read thousands of books, and when we're talking about the creative spirit, do you have an answer?

23:21.303 --> 23:22.725
Do you have any idea where it comes from?

23:22.925 --> 23:24.167
I mean, is it innate?

23:24.187 --> 23:26.310
Is it a gift?

23:26.330 --> 23:27.612
I take it, my dear...

23:28.435 --> 23:52.368
that that's partly what I was up to in the book you kindly just read, that I think when I speak of the best and oldest part of ourselves, which I call the gnosis or the spark, which is the traditional way of it, I take it that in some of us it ensues in contemplation or it ensues in a critical faculty.

23:52.408 --> 23:54.831
And in some of us...

23:57.697 --> 24:05.249
that rises up out of a deep well and becomes a creative spark or element.

24:05.850 --> 24:10.217
But I think in this, as in most things, I'm just repeating Emerson quite consciously.

24:11.459 --> 24:23.198
I mean, basically I think I've just written an Emersonian book and I quite deliberately, you know, called the first part of it self-reliance or mere gnosticism.

24:24.241 --> 24:27.686
because one is trying to extend Emerson into the present time.

24:28.667 --> 24:40.083
This is another really totally far-fetched question, but we are certainly in awe of imagination and the creator of the spirit.

24:40.103 --> 24:44.810
But let's say you could wave Prospero's One and you could spend an hour with Shakespeare.

24:44.830 --> 24:48.095
Do you have any idea what you'd like to talk to him about in one hour?

24:48.515 --> 24:48.956
Oh, sure.

24:50.117 --> 24:50.518
Oh, sure.

24:51.258 --> 24:53.460
There's a lot I would like to talk to him about.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.302
Specific things or creative things?

24:55.322 --> 24:55.682
Oh, yes.

24:56.543 --> 25:10.855
I would like to talk to him not so much about the sonnets, which I am content to have remained basically a mystery, but I would very much like to talk to him about some of the characters and some of the players.

25:12.757 --> 25:19.543
I would like to talk to him about the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth as he understood it.

25:21.177 --> 25:40.426
I would very much like to talk to him about whether or not, as I deeply suspect, there's a kind of absolute nihilism that underlies the four major tragedies.

25:40.526 --> 25:49.800
I guess I'd like to ask him how he really felt about Christopher Marlowe.

25:50.945 --> 25:53.188
since I feel increasingly that is a clue to him.

25:54.730 --> 25:55.951
I love Marlowe.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.095
Yeah, but I think Marlowe was for him both a blessing and a curse.

25:59.616 --> 26:01.639
Do you think Marlowe was the better poet?

26:01.659 --> 26:01.859
No.

26:03.281 --> 26:03.481
No?

26:03.641 --> 26:06.725
I mean, for that, for up to the age of 29, shall we say?

26:06.985 --> 26:08.307
No.

26:08.327 --> 26:14.695
I mean, the first one... I think if Shakespeare had died at 29, we would rank him below Marlowe.

26:15.997 --> 26:18.039
Um, but he didn't die at 29.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.281
Um,

26:24.323 --> 26:34.598
Also, I begin to wonder, as you'll see when this book comes out, I'm part of the company from one or two Shakespeareans.

26:34.718 --> 26:48.018
I agree with the late Professor Peter Alexander, the Scottish scholar, that the so-called Orr Hamlet, always attributed to Thomas Kidd on no basis whatsoever by traditional Shakespeare scholarship, was written by Shakespeare himself.

26:49.400 --> 26:49.560
Really?

26:49.580 --> 26:52.845
So that there was a first Hamlet way back there,

26:53.112 --> 27:05.403
probably much under the influence of Marlowe's Jew of Malta, and a very different play from what we have now, probably in existence by 1587, making it one of Shakespeare's earliest plays.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.106
What did you base this on?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.707
Oh, the plays that you base it on.

27:10.168 --> 27:13.571
We know that there was an earlier Hamlet.

27:14.452 --> 27:16.634
Wasn't there a Saxo Germanicus?

27:16.654 --> 27:18.135
Yeah, yeah, there's that.

27:18.155 --> 27:21.398
But we know that there was a play, Hamlet,

27:22.694 --> 27:36.688
And we know that when Shakespeare, in 1589, joined what was later to be called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, suddenly, for the first time, three plays appear in their repertory that weren't there before.

27:37.389 --> 27:43.515
One is Titus Andromachus, another is The Taming of the Shrew, and the third is a play called Hamlet.

27:43.535 --> 27:48.600
And these are supposedly during the lost years, what we call the lost years, and I think there's

27:48.867 --> 27:53.213
Well, yeah, it's just after the so-called lost years.

27:53.613 --> 27:54.815
But here's the point.

27:57.298 --> 28:01.604
They were not licensed to perform any play by Thomas Kidd.

28:03.626 --> 28:08.273
They could not perform the Spanish tragedy, which was vastly part of which they would have liked to perform.

28:09.474 --> 28:11.957
They were performing a play called Hamlet.

28:11.977 --> 28:15.602
They performed it after Shakespeare joined them as an active playwright.

28:16.003 --> 28:16.984
He brought it with him.

28:17.875 --> 28:18.896
and it was his play.

28:19.717 --> 28:25.922
And then he turned against it, and he revised it completely and made it into a very different Hamlet.

28:26.002 --> 28:29.064
I've written a chapter about that in this forthcoming book.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.886
And this idea is not original with me.

28:30.906 --> 28:41.074
This is the late Professor Peter Alexander, a very fine Scottish Shakespearean of the middle century, or I guess the 1940s and so.

28:41.675 --> 28:47.680
But for some reason, people have not taken this seriously.

28:48.115 --> 28:53.340
even though there's no evidence that the Orr Hamlet so-called had ever existed.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.945
There is no lost play by Thomas Kidd.

28:58.685 --> 29:00.607
We have no evidence for that whatsoever.

29:01.528 --> 29:03.831
Shakespeare appears to have written Hamlet twice.

29:05.652 --> 29:11.398
And you see parallels in the writing and the poetry?

29:11.758 --> 29:14.441
Yes, but this is one of the things I want to ask him.

29:15.042 --> 29:17.464
And if I had just one question I could ask him,

29:18.136 --> 29:19.058
It would be sure.

29:19.939 --> 29:40.035
Surely, as Professor Peter Alexander and I have surmised, you and not Thomas Kidd or some imitator of Kidd wrote the Orr Hamlet back there around 1587 or so, and then you got very unhappy with it about 1589 or so, and then you rewrote it completely in 1600, 1601, and made it the Hamlet we have now.

29:40.736 --> 29:43.080
I guess that's the primary thing I want to ask him.

29:43.415 --> 29:47.300
Does it bother you that he apparently never attempted to publish his plays?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.163
Oh, that's not quite true.

29:49.203 --> 29:50.985
That's a very complicated matter.

29:53.088 --> 30:00.097
I believe that had he lived, he would have emulated his friend and rival, Ben Johnson, and would have prepared a folio edition.

30:00.598 --> 30:05.985
I think that Hemmings and Kondo, with Johnson's help, were tearing out a wish that he had expressed.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.988
So you think that Johnson, as Talia said,

30:11.360 --> 30:12.301
It's quite possible.

30:12.321 --> 30:13.862
He certainly helped them with it.

30:15.224 --> 30:37.325
But something else also, the authorized quarters, you know, the second quarters, which correct the bad ones and so on, in some cases it is pretty clearly a case of Shakespeare himself coming forward, either because he doesn't like the earlier version and has revised, and we realize the features are so bad, though.

30:37.345 --> 30:40.168
Or just doesn't like exactly what's going on there.

30:40.807 --> 30:44.551
because they've been badly reported or pirated or whatever.

30:45.292 --> 30:52.340
I think it's very complex, the whole question of publication.

30:53.061 --> 30:57.746
If Shakespeare's manuscripts existed, would the plays be different for you?

30:57.846 --> 30:58.807
Would they read differently?

30:59.368 --> 31:00.369
Would you like to read them?

31:00.469 --> 31:05.515
This is a silly question, I guess, but we're talking about text.

31:05.798 --> 31:07.200
Sure one would love to read that.

31:07.220 --> 31:10.064
And we could get Shakespeare strictly through a printed text, which is amazing.

31:10.144 --> 31:12.688
If we had his file papers, that would be very fine.

31:13.850 --> 31:20.860
The only Shakespearean manuscript we have, besides a few signatures and a few legal things, is a little chunk of Sir Thomas More.

31:20.980 --> 31:21.822
That's all we've got.

31:22.042 --> 31:24.445
And you absolutely believe that is Shakespeare?

31:24.505 --> 31:25.727
Oh, yeah, I think so.

31:25.747 --> 31:27.770
I think they pretty well demonstrated that.

31:27.790 --> 31:33.038
Just as I believe, you know, what some of these young men have found recently, I don't think that this elegy...

31:33.895 --> 31:41.825
for Will Peter is a great poem, though it's not as bad as some people say it is, but I think it is by Shakespeare.

31:41.865 --> 31:42.345
I think so.

31:43.346 --> 31:50.715
And you've been so generous with your time, and if you don't mind, at some point, if there are other questions, I can give you a call.

31:51.496 --> 31:53.439
Oh, of course, dear fellow, of course.

31:53.499 --> 31:54.920
You have my phone number.

31:55.061 --> 31:57.664
Do you have my New York phone number, which is also unlisted?

31:58.365 --> 32:00.567
I don't.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.890
This weekend, my wife and I will be here.

32:03.207 --> 32:10.735
But after that, every weekend we will be at this number, at 212, my dear, 260-7085.

32:11.155 --> 32:14.439
That's in Manhattan.

32:14.579 --> 32:16.341
212-260-7085.

32:16.401 --> 32:24.249
No, no, my dear, when you prepare this column and then when you prepare something for the book, just phone me, my dear.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.812
We are friends, dear Nicholas, we are friends.

32:26.832 --> 32:31.797
And just quickly, if you could just give me one quote on this.

32:32.333 --> 32:42.485
the school of resentment which you wrote about... Well, you know, I took it from Nietzsche.

32:43.186 --> 32:53.178
I quoted that, in fact, in the Western canon when he speaks of the man or woman of resentment, using it in French, whose soul squints, as he put it.

32:54.199 --> 33:00.366
And I just felt that it was... Since I think ultimately...

33:00.650 --> 33:10.281
These are people who resent literature itself, who resent Shakespeare, really, who resent the greatness that they are shamed by.

33:11.362 --> 33:15.326
I thought it was the proper thing to call them, that it seems to have stuck.

33:17.088 --> 33:22.174
My other phrase for them has stuck as well, a rabblement of lemmings, which I like.

33:22.975 --> 33:27.940
Well, the lemmings comes from one of Thurib's fables for our time, about the lemmings rushing down to the sea.

33:28.291 --> 33:46.556
And The Rattlemen is a marvelous coinage of James Joyce, the young James Joyce, who replied to the Irish critics who had rioted when the Abbey put on productions of Ibsen.

33:49.159 --> 33:51.743
He wrote a pamphlet called The Day of the Rattlemen.

33:52.143 --> 33:52.464
Wow.

33:53.905 --> 33:56.229
I've got it right here, The Lemmings and Alice Walker.

33:56.249 --> 33:58.011
You know, he just makes...

33:59.662 --> 34:01.304
Poor Alice Walker.

34:01.324 --> 34:02.626
I met her once years ago.

34:04.048 --> 34:06.771
She was a charming lady, and I'm sure she was a charming lady.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.274
She probably hates my guts now.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.978
I think there's some bitterness with that woman, though.

34:13.039 --> 34:14.461
Oh, she's very bitter.

34:14.501 --> 34:17.905
But I'm not attacking her personally, obviously.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.669
It's just that the exaltation.

34:20.689 --> 34:27.357
I mean, there are some very bad writers in this country who are exalted just because they are black and because they are women.

34:27.775 --> 34:34.863
Adrian Rich is a very bad poet who is exalted just because, you know, she is a lesbian prophetess.

34:35.684 --> 34:47.236
Alice Walker is an extremely bad novelist and essayist and poet who is exalted just because she is a very aggressive, resentful black woman.

34:47.296 --> 34:48.538
And came along at that time.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.119
Are you familiar with this book?

34:50.239 --> 34:53.563
I think, in fact, I think Glenn and Lynn...

34:53.915 --> 34:58.842
were the agents on this one, by the woman at Wellesley about not out of Africa?

34:59.223 --> 35:00.024
Mary Lefkowitz.

35:00.044 --> 35:00.645
Lefkowitz.

35:00.665 --> 35:01.466
Very bright girl.

35:01.486 --> 35:02.768
She was at this point, by the way.

35:02.828 --> 35:03.109
I know Mary.

35:03.249 --> 35:07.415
Mary is a very bright girl, and I believe she's married to my old child, you, Lloyd-Jones.

35:08.076 --> 35:08.256
Yeah.

35:08.316 --> 35:11.421
In fact, I introduced myself to her, and I'm going to talk to her.

35:12.162 --> 35:15.948
Mary is a fine lady, a very fine lady.

35:16.449 --> 35:22.858
And then, of course, this concept, when they are attacking the Western canon, the phrase they invariably use is,

35:23.142 --> 35:24.865
Dead white men.

35:26.067 --> 35:27.229
So dismissively.

35:27.249 --> 35:29.833
Dead white European males.

35:29.873 --> 35:30.434
Jwems.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.178
Dead white European males.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.541
The Jwems.

35:34.561 --> 35:35.803
Dead white European males.

35:35.823 --> 35:38.767
That is to say, Shakespeare, Dante, Huma.

35:39.549 --> 35:42.093
Cervantes, the whole world.

35:42.113 --> 35:47.281
Cervantes, Tolstoy, Wordsworth.

35:47.341 --> 35:48.323
Charles Dickens.

35:49.163 --> 35:50.144
Oh, all of them.

35:50.164 --> 36:03.196
James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, another dead white Montaigne, Emerson, Whitman, or dead white, well, no, some of them are not European, but, or dead white American males.

36:03.517 --> 36:04.758
Are they impossible?

36:04.778 --> 36:06.800
You come to a lot of stuff.

36:06.820 --> 36:08.181
They are just impossible.

36:09.422 --> 36:15.728
But, you know, Nicholas, I'm very grateful to you because as I said to you over the phone, and I'll say to you again for the second time today,

36:16.467 --> 36:25.402
Due to the vicissitudes, normally when a book of mine is coming out, they send me a big batch of them, and I distribute them to friends, and I get some feedback.

36:26.103 --> 36:36.620
With this book, my friend Jonathan Spence, who's off in England, so I haven't had any... I mean, no one has read it except my agents and my editor and a few people, so you're my first reader.

36:36.780 --> 36:40.146
And I'll tell you, the writing is very clean.

36:40.312 --> 36:41.413
Thank you, thank you.

36:41.973 --> 36:42.874
Well, I'm very pleased.

36:43.254 --> 37:10.217
I have seen a review coming out by Michael Derda, the editor of Washington Post Book World, which is coming out in the magazine Civilization, and I've seen a crazy review, wild and flamboyant, by my former doctoral student, the wild Frank McConnell, which is going to come out in the Boston Sunday Globe, and I had read to me over the phone this piece that came out as a sort of op-ed column in last Sunday's Baltimore Sun,

37:10.855 --> 37:16.842
But those are the only reactions I have so far, and you are the first reader I've been able to talk to face-to-face.

37:17.342 --> 37:19.145
So you cheered me up a lot when I needed it.

37:19.165 --> 37:30.518
My feeling is it's hard, because these are anxious times, waiting for the birth of the child and the delivery of the child.

37:30.538 --> 37:32.560
Well, I don't have high expectations.

37:32.928 --> 37:35.031
I don't have high expectations.

37:35.972 --> 37:38.495
The humor comes through, by the way.

37:38.515 --> 37:43.562
I tried to discipline the humor more than I had in the American religion or the Western canon.

37:43.582 --> 37:47.126
I tried to keep it from getting out of hand.

37:47.567 --> 37:49.610
But it's a gentle humor.

37:50.631 --> 37:54.416
Would you do me the honor of inscribing a couple of... Oh, my dear fellow.

37:55.437 --> 37:56.659
I would be honored.

37:56.759 --> 38:01.585
I cannot ask you to inscribe your splendid book because my copy was sent to me in my

38:01.818 --> 38:07.468
apartment in New York, and I read it in New York, and it was in my bookshelf in New York.

38:07.488 --> 38:11.896
This is a great... It's like I told my wife I want to bring three.

38:12.176 --> 38:13.458
Okay, thanks a lot.

38:14.019 --> 38:15.442
I know this seems excessive.

38:15.462 --> 38:16.584
No, not at all, my dear.

38:16.684 --> 38:17.245
I am honored.
