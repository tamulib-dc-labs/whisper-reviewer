00:02.782 --> 00:05.486
Test, one, two, test, test, test, test, test.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.390
Chuck, Amy Chan here.

00:08.410 --> 00:11.314
Congratulations.

00:11.334 --> 00:11.935
New book.

00:12.977 --> 00:15.400
And there's a theme here, of course, of ghosts.

00:15.581 --> 00:22.290
I wonder if you can explain, do you have ghosts that you believe in?

00:22.310 --> 00:28.039
Do you have past existences that, multi-faceted questions?

00:28.099 --> 00:31.624
Well, as Quarren says, we don't call them ghosts anymore.

00:33.106 --> 00:43.201
I've had a lot of experiences in my life that I've tried to explain, explain away, I suppose.

00:43.942 --> 00:50.272
And this was my chance to just sort of let the ghost out of the closet and have fun with it.

00:50.893 --> 00:54.859
So is it a matter of what did the imagination run?

00:55.140 --> 01:02.050
In part that, but also bringing in a lot of the experiences I have had.

01:02.789 --> 01:15.181
All the sounds in the house, the appearance of certain apparitions, I guess.

01:16.542 --> 01:17.163
Whistling.

01:17.423 --> 01:18.824
Very humorous things.

01:19.064 --> 01:24.249
I've had a number of things happen.

01:24.289 --> 01:26.291
Prophetic dreams.

01:30.095 --> 01:32.357
Advice given to me.

01:33.248 --> 01:38.195
give you a chance to put that all in there.

01:40.237 --> 01:41.159
Past lives, no.

01:41.279 --> 01:43.482
I don't know of any past lives.

01:43.502 --> 01:56.900
There's plenty of life to deal with right now, but I'm not discounting the possibilities of past lives.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.968
I've read a few older features, a person of you, and then I read where you have gone to China to meet

02:03.218 --> 02:06.323
to the half-sisters that you have from your mother's lawyer.

02:08.826 --> 02:18.961
Can one assume, therefore, that the premise that you set up here draws out some of this autobiographical experience here?

02:19.602 --> 02:19.962
No.

02:20.243 --> 02:26.091
This is one of those books that is entirely non-autobiographical.

02:26.993 --> 02:30.778
I never lived in 1858, as far as I know.

02:31.332 --> 02:34.455
My sisters are nothing like farms.

02:34.475 --> 02:41.621
One of my sisters, however, the youngest oldest sister, lived in Guayland for about ten years.

02:42.782 --> 02:52.952
From her I was able to find out a little bit more about the cuisine and the way the frogs are prepared, for example, and the pickled nuts wine.

02:54.533 --> 02:59.938
I was in that area of Guayland myself, though, and that's what I

03:00.391 --> 03:09.243
I drew upon an experience of the landscape, but not life there.

03:09.263 --> 03:12.787
Whose voice came to you first here?

03:12.807 --> 03:22.721
Of course, we've heard all the barriers, but I think perhaps easily the more interesting, for my case, sister, is the Chinese.

03:22.881 --> 03:23.922
I'm just wondering.

03:23.962 --> 03:29.149
Yeah, Kwan's voice definitely came through clearly to me.

03:30.209 --> 03:45.943
I know it's clear because I find it easier to write in her voice and surprising things that come out, which to me is when I'm not struggling so hard.

03:46.744 --> 03:59.575
I think when I choose a voice that's closer to my own, there's a little bit of self-consciousness still there, thinking, well, I don't want to sound too stupid or too bitchy or whatever.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.964
And I didn't let go.

04:05.088 --> 04:15.485
But how was the tactical decision to never?

04:16.306 --> 04:19.011
No, no.

04:20.393 --> 04:21.956
He's had a lot of plumbing problems.

04:22.276 --> 04:23.418
What's the doggy's name?

04:23.458 --> 04:24.039
Bubba Zell.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.441
Sorry, what was it again?

04:25.502 --> 04:26.423
Bubba Zell.

04:26.960 --> 04:36.449
B-U-B-B-A and then V-O.

04:36.469 --> 04:36.569
Okay.

04:36.629 --> 04:38.230
You don't mind my shooting pictures?

04:38.791 --> 04:40.332
No, no, that's fine.

04:40.392 --> 04:41.954
No, I even use a flash occasionally.

04:41.974 --> 04:53.344
I'm sorry, so we were talking about the decision to formulate the specific narrative structure that you... Oh, right, right.

04:53.364 --> 04:54.165
I had a...

04:57.352 --> 05:02.298
a sense of Quan, and I didn't know who Lydia was going to be.

05:02.318 --> 05:09.046
In fact, I had to spell out some more of who she was, as well as Simon.

05:09.106 --> 05:15.534
They were mostly, in the beginning, the backdrop to have the story of Quan.

05:16.155 --> 05:26.127
I knew I couldn't have the whole book in Quan's voice because she's such a, in the beginning especially, would be considered your unreliable character.

05:26.933 --> 05:41.028
had strange ideas that most of us would not be familiar with or agree with.

05:41.048 --> 05:42.970
So I had to present her to the eyes of a very skeptical sister.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.312
We had a troubled relationship with her, with the world.

05:45.332 --> 05:47.094
How does it start with the characters?

05:47.114 --> 05:54.342
Because the story really does certainly engage the reader to the very end.

05:54.845 --> 05:57.328
Tell me a little bit about the process.

05:57.348 --> 05:58.569
What do you start with?

05:58.910 --> 06:02.814
You certainly wanted to do something with Two Sisters, I guess, worlds apart.

06:03.595 --> 06:05.577
I started with another novel.

06:07.259 --> 06:11.363
I threw that out after 200 pages because it wasn't working.

06:11.383 --> 06:20.814
And once I decided to write about these ghosts, it was as though my difficulty in writing went away.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.637
And I had a...

06:26.401 --> 06:31.147
really didn't know where the story was going in the beginning, which is good.

06:33.209 --> 06:38.356
Whereas the other story, the other book I was trying to write was trying to control as much.

06:40.018 --> 06:47.808
I had heard about a young girl through a friend of mine who's a child psychiatrist.

06:47.828 --> 06:54.636
And he said that this girl could detect illness and whether somebody had a broken bone

06:55.392 --> 07:00.599
in the field of the past, without touching them, she could just sense through energy.

07:01.901 --> 07:12.537
And she was taunted and feared in the school that she went to by her American classmates, and she became emotionally disturbed.

07:12.557 --> 07:25.315
And the combination of her being distraught and claiming to see ghosts or divine illness, made the psychiatrist

07:26.662 --> 07:29.825
think that she was psychotic or schizophrenic.

07:31.087 --> 07:41.138
Her parents decided not to have her undergo medical treatment, medication, and hospitalization.

07:41.158 --> 07:43.020
They sent her back to Taiwan to love her grandparents.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.242
And there, in that culture, she was revered.

07:45.262 --> 07:46.404
She was respected.

07:46.484 --> 07:50.188
All the kids thought she was the luckiest girl in the world because she could talk to ghosts.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.830
And she became very happy.

07:51.870 --> 07:55.774
And I thought, well, there's an interesting

07:57.391 --> 08:12.426
look at, not a girl, but at cultures and how they influence what we believe and why and how that in turn affects the rest of us.

08:12.446 --> 08:25.879
And so I took as my starting point this girl who was not tolerated that well in this country,

08:27.884 --> 08:30.587
It's fascinating to me.

08:30.607 --> 08:35.912
If you take it a step further, you have to be betrayed by a woman in that system.

08:36.712 --> 08:39.075
Yes, exactly, and then she gets that too much.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.877
That's magnifying it by, you know, multiplying it by 10 in there.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.359
Yes, right.

08:43.379 --> 08:55.410
And any time she's betrayed, the quantity trends it, then it seems to be a trend of love, which is kind of a amusing kind of...

08:56.167 --> 08:57.028
Great, thank you.

08:59.492 --> 09:02.937
Yeah, I think, well, there's a story about love.

09:02.957 --> 09:14.594
Over the last few years, I've talked to people who had marriages in trouble or were falling in love or sort of left one marriage and started another one.

09:14.614 --> 09:18.500
And you've brought up these questions about who are we destined to find?

09:18.520 --> 09:25.650
And people say, well, it was destiny that we always would meet or...

09:26.508 --> 09:30.673
I needed unconditional love.

09:31.293 --> 09:33.896
What are all these notions people have about that?

09:33.916 --> 09:44.768
Like one of the characters who embodied that notion of unconditional love, but somewhere back there is a reason for that unconditional love.

09:44.788 --> 09:50.034
It's not quite understood until later.

09:50.615 --> 09:55.300
But instead of through a male-female love, something between sisters,

09:56.022 --> 10:10.502
And as it turns out later, a sister who might, in fact, not be a sister, depending on what you believe at the end of the book.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.045
I read also where, if you don't mind jumping around?

10:13.065 --> 10:13.626
No, no, please.

10:13.646 --> 10:19.394
Because really, my job is to read the book, too, but I hate to ask you to me a question about the book.

10:19.835 --> 10:23.059
Where I am also interested in the biographical side.

10:24.507 --> 10:33.122
But I did read the research aspect of it, but how taken you were about to use every lung medicine.

10:33.944 --> 10:37.329
And that happens to my wife.

10:38.351 --> 10:46.245
And I also read another quote where initially when you sold your first book,

10:46.732 --> 10:55.606
surmise it to be a form of tokenism, I guess, a gesture to a hyphenated American.

10:56.367 --> 11:02.376
If you could just talk about that a little bit.

11:02.396 --> 11:08.085
I guess what was driving, Allison, your own perception of where your work is in America.

11:08.225 --> 11:14.595
It is American, whether it's a question or a profile and a little bit of a lot of a certain segment of American culture.

11:15.925 --> 11:25.897
Well, as you said, I was suspicious in the beginning that perhaps they were just publishing me to fill some quota that was out there somehow.

11:26.057 --> 11:43.738
It's really the readers that convinced me that people were reading it for other reasons, that they found these specific stories about mothers who happened to be from a different culture from most readers that they could find themselves.

11:45.423 --> 12:06.084
I do think that also over the last few years there remains still some tendency to place any story that is by somebody not of the mainstream culture whose family background may have been from another country and call it some sort of ethnic literature.

12:08.246 --> 12:12.510
That hasn't happened as much with me, but I've heard so often

12:13.148 --> 12:18.356
somebody say, oh, no, we don't need the Gus Lee because we already have the Amy Tan.

12:18.377 --> 12:26.089
Or, no, we're not going to read the, you know, the Miami because we're reading the Amy Tan.

12:26.289 --> 12:28.713
And so somehow they're the same.

12:28.994 --> 12:35.865
And that's what disturbs me, that people will categorize and limit themselves there.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.332
by saying that we're all of the same.

12:39.873 --> 12:42.536
Right.

12:42.636 --> 12:56.352
Well, ignoring it as literature and simply looking at the books as culture, I think that certainly all books have something to say about the cultures in which their stories take place.

12:57.153 --> 13:03.540
But, as you say, there are other aspects to the story

13:03.908 --> 13:19.587
in body language or characters or ideas or emotions that are quite different from one of them.

13:19.607 --> 13:26.356
And the larger framework in terms of American fiction that is in making body, enormous body work, where it allows for so much.

13:26.496 --> 13:33.004
I think that's one of the wonderful things about American literature is that it can

13:33.895 --> 13:53.703
encompass so much, as opposed to, say, French literature, which I find very important in their ideas of, well, not French literature per se, but the French readership, which influences them what gets published.

13:53.723 --> 14:01.995
And I think American readers have become much more open to reading what I call different

14:02.330 --> 14:07.878
I just received a reading copy of Jeneva Kincaid's next book.

14:07.898 --> 14:08.760
I'm so excited.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.504
I love her work.

14:12.225 --> 14:15.209
There's an experience.

14:15.229 --> 14:22.340
Usually her stories are based in Antiqua, and she has the most wonderful way of writing.

14:22.360 --> 14:27.848
She's an American writer, and she lived in New York.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.424
Well, you live in New York now.

14:30.484 --> 14:33.529
How long have you lived in New York?

14:33.549 --> 14:43.065
I've had a place since June, but I really live in San Francisco, and I come here, and I do work here, but I, you know.

14:43.085 --> 14:48.033
Certainly, I never stayed in New York, but I did.

14:48.294 --> 14:52.701
Do you consider yourself a San Franciscan now, or a New Yorker?

14:52.841 --> 14:53.262
San Franciscan.

14:53.900 --> 15:06.000
Right, because this year I was going to be doing so much in New York, finishing my book and looking at some of the projects that I just decided to do as a partner for the year.

15:06.581 --> 15:13.773
I stumbled my place and my husband just left about half an hour ago to go back to San Francisco.

15:14.595 --> 15:18.962
So, yeah, that's what this was done.

15:19.313 --> 15:24.540
She lives in the Bay Area, in Oakland.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.104
Her other house burned down.

15:27.845 --> 15:39.541
She was caught in that terrible fire and lost her novel.

15:40.042 --> 15:46.030
It's appalling because you can never write the same thing over again, the freshness.

15:47.022 --> 15:50.846
Your excitement of writing is gone.

15:50.866 --> 15:51.607
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:51.627 --> 15:52.107
Oh, yeah.

15:52.348 --> 15:55.651
That put her behind schedule.

15:55.671 --> 15:56.412
You know, what a tragedy.

15:56.432 --> 15:58.194
Which, you know, of course, whatever she says.

15:58.214 --> 16:02.438
Yeah, if I lost my novelist, she's done.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.681
She has something coming out, I think, soon.

16:05.421 --> 16:06.763
Maybe next year.

16:06.943 --> 16:11.288
Do you have a sense of your readership in there?

16:11.308 --> 16:14.251
And this is now your very novelist.

16:14.271 --> 16:15.392
Were you writing before?

16:18.022 --> 16:37.492
Yes, and they are primarily women around my age or mothers, but also a lot of students.

16:37.512 --> 16:41.117
But I think it's because their teachers forced them to write these letters.

16:42.079 --> 16:46.746
And the Joy Luck Club especially has been required

16:47.182 --> 16:55.632
I can't tell you how many teachers think it's a new idea that they have their entire classroom write an author questions.

16:56.313 --> 16:59.377
Seeing the author is going to be able to sit down and do that.

16:59.477 --> 17:04.223
I feel so terrible because I have no time to do that.

17:04.563 --> 17:06.105
Not even one for school.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.708
I mean, they just come in floods, you know.

17:09.649 --> 17:16.277
Usually they come around April or May, and it'll be a letter, Dear Miss Tan,

17:16.747 --> 17:20.493
My teacher said I should write to you.

17:20.513 --> 17:22.817
I have a paper due next week.

17:22.837 --> 17:30.870
Could you please answer these 20 questions and send it back to me as soon as possible?

17:30.890 --> 17:31.752
Next week.

17:31.772 --> 17:36.039
But the letter has been forwarded to me from the publisher, and it's two months later.

17:36.079 --> 17:38.022
So, I mean, the deadline has passed.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.488
I keep thinking, what happened to all these students?

17:42.025 --> 17:48.937
I can tell you, my 13-year-old guy is very depressed by meeting with you today.

17:48.957 --> 17:56.350
And that Michael Tyson was on a calendar, too, on a Jurassic Park at the Joy Love Hall.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.474
And he's saying, this is very depressing.

17:58.494 --> 18:06.227
What is it that you think, why is the Joy Love Hall such a good book for young kids to do that?

18:13.463 --> 18:41.766
Well, when I think of the letters that I've received from students who were not assigned to write to me, who wrote from their hearts, they often say they thought they were alone in the world and they felt this place, that they did not belong to either

18:42.775 --> 18:50.043
their parents' culture or that of their schooling.

18:54.247 --> 18:56.169
And in reading this book, they discovered they weren't alone.

18:56.190 --> 18:58.812
And it gave them great hope.

18:58.832 --> 19:05.960
And it made them feel that they were normal.

19:05.980 --> 19:09.904
And I think so many of us grow up in an environment where we don't entirely fit.

19:10.765 --> 19:11.466
And I would say a majority.

19:12.053 --> 19:34.056
young people have those feelings at some point.

19:34.076 --> 19:38.520
And they see that it can happen with somebody from their own culture, or whose family is from their own culture, but it's a common feeling.

19:38.541 --> 19:40.963
In the Joy Luck Club, there are so many characters at different ages, young kids, nine-year-olds, teenagers, young women,

19:41.180 --> 19:47.146
reaching the 30s and 40s in the older generation.

19:47.166 --> 19:54.392
I think that gave people an opportunity to look at what they might have gone through and went to.

19:54.412 --> 20:10.427
I often feel that what I write about is so ordinary, and I'm not saying this to be self-deprecating, but ordinary emotions, meaning that we all have these things.

20:12.635 --> 20:22.966
I've found that if I bought a Volkswagen in 1972, 50% of the people my age bought a Volkswagen.

20:23.646 --> 20:28.691
If I got a little dog, everybody seems getting a little dog.

20:29.212 --> 20:36.159
Somehow, I am that age bracket that is the median age of baby boomers.

20:36.179 --> 20:41.865
Whatever I'm doing or thinking is, we should sort of fall right into

20:42.183 --> 20:47.510
the path of what's happening in that pig in the python.

20:47.971 --> 21:07.036
So even though I might write stories that are specific to a Chinese-American background, the feeling seems to be true for many people.

21:07.056 --> 21:09.099
How do you see your work in developing this body of life?

21:09.119 --> 21:09.439
Is it a corpus?

21:12.035 --> 21:41.502
I haven't consciously set out to build a body of work that follows along certain ideas or themes, but I find looking back that all my books have a lot to do with hope and a sense of

21:42.511 --> 21:52.025
Also, questions about what you believe and why.

21:52.346 --> 22:10.493
This book has much more ado about all kinds of love, as opposed to mother-daughter love, and certainly about hope and how hope feeds into what you believe and why we believe certain ideas.

22:13.915 --> 22:19.020
I don't think I'll know the answer to that until at the end of my life.

22:19.040 --> 22:24.827
Somebody else be on it, I guess, starts to evaluate.

22:24.907 --> 22:33.356
Yeah, I think that'll be the deconstructionist points of view.

22:34.176 --> 22:38.021
I have a friend who's a psychologist, and he's in my writer's group.

22:38.041 --> 22:42.285
We read our work, we'll ask to teach each other.

22:43.008 --> 22:48.376
He's heard this in pieces as I was writing it and reading about it.

22:48.397 --> 22:51.682
But he read the whole thing in yelling form.

22:51.702 --> 23:10.872
And he analyzed it and he's decided that this book is about my coming to grips with a part of me that I rejected early in life that had nothing to do with culture but being overweight and nerdy and

23:11.915 --> 23:16.961
as something, which didn't resonate with me, but, you know, who knows?

23:16.981 --> 23:24.329
I said, well, may you live long enough that after I die that you can write about that.

23:24.669 --> 23:30.436
I don't think that it's true, but, you know, that might be the analysis if somebody comes up with later.

23:30.456 --> 23:33.840
Now, did you always write?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.762
Was writing something that you...

23:37.312 --> 23:40.356
I've always wanted, I always liked writing.

23:40.397 --> 23:45.023
I didn't ever think I'd become a fiction writer.

23:47.808 --> 23:52.915
I think because I was raised to be more practical than that.

23:52.935 --> 23:56.020
I thought you had to get a real job.

23:56.040 --> 24:01.868
You couldn't do something you loved.

24:01.888 --> 24:05.954
You had to do something that was hard work and responsible.

24:05.974 --> 24:07.116
Don't mind me, I'm enjoying it.

24:07.585 --> 24:12.291
I thought I was going to be a doctor because that's what I was told I was supposed to be.

24:12.311 --> 24:15.695
I wrote, when I was young, letters primarily to friends.

24:15.715 --> 24:27.350
I did write an essay when I was eight on what the library means to me, and that was published in the Center of the British Democrats.

24:27.370 --> 24:27.951
It won me a transistor radio.

24:27.971 --> 24:35.601
All my friends who remember getting letters from me say that I was a prolific, amazing letter writer, and they kept the letters.

24:37.505 --> 24:47.037
And because I thought I had a very dull life, I made up things in the letters of what was going on.

24:47.578 --> 24:48.679
I made up names for myself.

24:49.881 --> 24:52.184
I'm doing somebody else, and made up stories.

24:52.644 --> 24:56.269
I suppose that's in my life fiction.

24:56.669 --> 25:07.343
Early readers were just the person that happened to me.

25:07.593 --> 25:12.379
You're talking about irony of irony.

25:14.242 --> 25:19.749
Is it a trip to Europe for you to realize something about your life here and how you do it?

25:19.769 --> 25:20.711
Know if you feel a little bit about that.

25:20.731 --> 25:23.254
I guess you're 15, maybe?

25:23.274 --> 25:23.855
16.

25:23.935 --> 25:30.103
My father died when I was 15.

25:30.203 --> 25:32.186
My mother took us to live in Europe.

25:33.488 --> 25:37.313
We actually didn't know we were in Switzerland, but that's where we ended up.

25:38.103 --> 25:43.590
There, I was so exotic.

25:44.711 --> 25:49.818
Here in the States at the time, I thought I was ugly.

25:49.838 --> 25:57.447
And over there, I was beautiful because I was different and exotic.

25:57.467 --> 25:58.929
I had men following me around.

25:58.949 --> 26:06.979
I was at the time 30 pounds heavier than I am now when I was an adolescent.

26:10.452 --> 26:22.891
It was a revelation to me that the way I felt about myself had so much to do with the people around me and their opinions, and that was dangerous.

26:25.394 --> 26:38.834
It was a good lesson in self-esteem that you have to decide what you truly think is for yourself and what it means to be an individual that you don't have to be the same.

26:38.854 --> 26:39.936
I wanted to be an American.

26:40.777 --> 26:43.821
meaning to be the same as everybody else.

26:43.841 --> 26:48.488
But I think to be an American is to really create your own identity.

26:48.508 --> 26:51.573
That's what this country was founded on.

26:52.013 --> 26:57.201
How long did it take you to this country's realization?

26:57.782 --> 27:10.260
I wouldn't have put it in those words at the age of 16, but I certainly felt the first idea, which is I have to develop my own sense of who I am and not

27:12.080 --> 27:22.251
not allowed myself to fluctuate in my feelings depending on whether I was popular or not or exotic or not.

27:22.431 --> 27:30.960
Those were external opinions and I couldn't be what I held myself.

27:30.980 --> 27:39.910
Of course, you could think that and you go through life and you still want to please people, you still want to be accepted and to belong.

27:40.345 --> 28:02.636
And I think it's been all my life, you know, I've been saying, hey, wait a minute, I can't judge how good of a writer I am by how many books I sell or what kind of reviews I get or, you know, I have to know what's important for me to write.

28:04.078 --> 28:10.167
And if I achieved those ideas

28:11.412 --> 28:19.760
And then what I've written was worthwhile in that sense.

28:19.780 --> 28:30.951
It doesn't mean I'm immune from feeling hurt, you know, if the book doesn't sell or if I get a bad review or if somebody says, I hated your book.

28:31.492 --> 28:33.634
Has anyone said that to you?

28:34.675 --> 28:39.900
Oh, yeah, I've got some letters from people who thought my last book was

28:40.218 --> 28:41.620
absolute pornography.

28:43.382 --> 28:45.604
I would never read another book of mine again.

28:45.664 --> 29:00.422
Another woman who came and heard me give a talk and thought I was, she felt she had wasted her money going to the talk and she could have gone to a movie instead or something like that.

29:00.442 --> 29:08.892
So you get these letters that are, you know, and I realize you can't please everybody, but it

29:09.209 --> 29:20.886
It is, you know, if you take it on the personal level, it's very wounding, and then I just have to let it go and take it out.

29:21.387 --> 29:23.510
You said earlier that you would plan to be a physician.

29:24.692 --> 29:26.775
How far did you take that plan?

29:26.795 --> 29:31.542
I enrolled as a pre-med student my first year of college, and I quickly changed English.

29:31.562 --> 29:35.267
Linfield College, and we had Minville, Oregon.

29:35.551 --> 29:42.058
One of the papers that takes my column is Eugene.

29:42.078 --> 29:45.041
I've read about 30 newspapers.

29:45.061 --> 29:58.375
I've targeted universities, cities like Eugene, Columbus, Ohio, Texas, Gainesville, Knoxville, Charlotte, all these universities.

29:58.395 --> 29:59.556
Right, right.

30:00.777 --> 30:03.600
I got my degree from San Jose State.

30:04.137 --> 30:09.723
and also went to UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley.

30:10.945 --> 30:13.547
And so when did the writing start, in all of this?

30:13.567 --> 30:15.249
When did the Joy Life Club start?

30:18.093 --> 30:29.385
I started writing in 1985, fiction, but I had been a business writer before that, starting in 1985.

30:29.405 --> 30:31.107
And I wrote my first story

30:34.850 --> 30:38.294
Actually, I had little fragments of stories that I never finished.

30:38.314 --> 30:56.053
They were written not as a Chinese-American girl or woman, but a man or somebody completely different.

30:56.173 --> 31:03.861
When I finally wrote this story, it was to get into a writer's workshop called the Squaw Valley Community of Writers.

31:04.415 --> 31:12.565
eventually became rules of the game, and the story about Waverly, the chess player.

31:12.585 --> 31:24.559
That was also, at 86 I read Love Medicine, and then reinforced this idea that I should write and find a voice.

31:24.619 --> 31:32.228
Was it the fact that the multiple voices that Louise used in Love Medicine, that persuaded you that this is something we did?

31:32.883 --> 31:48.017
Well, that I could write a number of stories and then see what it would be like to take a mother's point of view.

31:48.037 --> 31:48.778
And it was liberating.

31:49.459 --> 31:55.685
And I think I really fell in love with the idea of writing.

31:55.805 --> 32:00.409
But I lost that lapse where I didn't feel I

32:02.768 --> 32:06.073
cared enough about fiction writing in some sense.

32:07.195 --> 32:14.265
I loved to read, and I never truly thought I'd become a published writer, and I was doing it for myself.

32:14.285 --> 32:16.068
You didn't think about it, really?

32:16.088 --> 32:20.134
No, I had this dream of, you know, I was a business writer.

32:20.935 --> 32:23.379
I had... This is freelancer.

32:23.399 --> 32:24.881
Freelance business writer.

32:25.602 --> 32:31.932
And I was doing things for corporations, writing for IBM and AT&T.

32:33.633 --> 32:38.558
Bell operating company before and after divestiture.

32:38.578 --> 32:40.040
And that was my living.

32:40.761 --> 32:47.328
I had very good clients, I had as much work as I wanted, and I could pick projects.

32:47.348 --> 32:52.213
And the fiction was something I did in my spare time.

32:52.233 --> 33:00.443
I didn't have a lot of spare time, and sometimes months would go by and I didn't have time to write any fiction.

33:00.463 --> 33:03.606
But something would always happen to remind me

33:04.868 --> 33:08.451
to write more fiction.

33:08.471 --> 33:16.198
This is when I started thinking there was some sort of spirit going on.

33:16.719 --> 33:33.694
I'd get a call and it'd be somebody from a little literary magazine saying, so-and-so told us you were writing fiction and she told us about this story and we'd like her to send it in so we could take a look at it.

33:34.349 --> 33:38.114
I said, sure, where is that thing?

33:38.135 --> 33:43.703
They said, I'm going to publish it and give me $30 for two issues.

33:43.723 --> 33:44.544
I said, oh, that's great.

33:45.025 --> 33:59.466
I had in my mind that maybe when I was about 16, I'd get something published finally in some magazine and that would be proof that it was worth it all along.

33:59.486 --> 34:02.550
Meaning a short story published in some

34:03.796 --> 34:20.292
And here this thing happened, and then I'd forget about writing, and then I'd get a phone call, and I'd go, hi, this is Seventeen Magazine, and we want to reprint your story.

34:20.332 --> 34:28.820
The first time they called, I thought they were trying to sell me a subscription, and I didn't answer back, and they called again.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.963
And then I heard this little voice again, and it was a little kick, you know.

34:32.517 --> 34:38.383
And then another thing happened.

34:38.403 --> 34:41.886
Somebody called me, congratulations on your international debut.

34:43.087 --> 34:46.390
And he had seen my story in an Italian magazine translated.

34:46.651 --> 34:49.834
I never gave permission.

34:49.974 --> 34:51.535
They told him the story.

34:51.595 --> 34:54.318
They claimed they tried to get permission.

34:54.518 --> 34:59.723
They didn't contact me, so they took the story and translated it.

35:00.800 --> 35:09.492
again, you know, a little voice, and then an agent calls, you know, and I heard that, you know, you're a short story writer, and I'd like to talk to them.

35:09.512 --> 35:11.394
I said, no, I'm not, I'm a business writer.

35:11.414 --> 35:16.421
I happen to have this one story that's been published in three places.

35:17.703 --> 35:18.524
Isn't that amazing?

35:18.544 --> 35:19.545
It's an amazing story, I must say.

35:19.765 --> 35:20.526
It's amazing.

35:20.546 --> 35:22.549
I mean, I did my thing.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.812
So you were approached by an agent.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.835
I did not pursue an agent.

35:28.457 --> 35:29.338
Right, right.

35:29.926 --> 35:31.668
I was approached by an agent.

35:33.651 --> 35:53.155
The one thing that I did do was I'd write these terrible stories or this, you know, rules of the game or whatever, and then these other fragments of bad things that were not, you know, like the male macho Ivy League person.

35:53.175 --> 35:59.663
And I'd send them off to The New Yorker, and I'd get my standard rejection, you know, six weeks later or whatever.

36:00.318 --> 36:13.857
And I had this plan that I was going to build this wall in my office, and I was going to like a collage, and I'd have all these rejection splits.

36:14.258 --> 36:23.551
And it wasn't to feel bad, it was just sort of like a humorous thing, but it was my way of, you know, kind of, you had to do something with it.

36:23.571 --> 36:27.456
You sent it out and the world came back, okay, and start over on something else.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.310
And so I did.

36:29.330 --> 36:32.013
I had a little collection of rejections.

36:32.033 --> 36:33.114
So did you have a lot of rejections?

36:34.436 --> 36:38.380
I had, I think, three.

36:39.761 --> 36:41.964
But see, I had one from the New Yorker.

36:41.984 --> 36:43.746
It was a standard rejection.

36:43.786 --> 36:45.928
But somebody had pinned in a little sorry.

36:47.089 --> 36:49.512
And then I got a personalized one.

36:51.174 --> 36:56.379
And, you know, why it didn't quite work for this person to keep writing.

36:56.419 --> 36:56.920
This is great.

36:57.254 --> 37:02.339
Then I got another one that was sort of another nicer rejection.

37:02.419 --> 37:04.801
Peter Osmond, New Yorker?

37:04.921 --> 37:06.363
Yeah, yeah.

37:06.383 --> 37:10.467
So reading a little bit more interesting, I think.

37:10.487 --> 37:18.635
Yeah, and now, this next, I don't know, October 2nd or something, I have a story coming out from New Yorker.

37:18.775 --> 37:19.095
Really?

37:19.476 --> 37:19.996
What happened?

37:20.016 --> 37:20.116
Yeah.

37:20.136 --> 37:21.177
Can you see your question?

37:21.358 --> 37:21.658
Yeah.

37:22.058 --> 37:26.803
A lot of water has to pass the keel on.

37:26.823 --> 37:26.923
Yeah.

37:27.511 --> 37:28.572
I know it's different.

37:28.672 --> 37:42.626
If I had been the complete unknown short story writer, it's a different feeling, obviously.

37:42.646 --> 37:44.168
But I never felt bad about it.

37:44.208 --> 37:48.132
I never took these things as personal rejections.

37:49.173 --> 37:54.919
It was always fun to do, and I always had a little hope, a little excitement.

37:55.591 --> 38:03.040
I didn't have that sort of, okay, you know, move on to something else, write another story.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.722
Plus, you never had a job.

38:05.042 --> 38:06.023
Yeah, right.

38:06.043 --> 38:12.070
And I had a job in which I was writing, and I was very well-liked in my life.

38:12.831 --> 38:18.158
Yeah, you know, it's sort of like, gosh, maybe I can be an interior decorator.

38:19.679 --> 38:22.763
You go off and buy fabric and do something every now and then.

38:23.350 --> 38:35.764
I think it was 16-5.

38:35.784 --> 38:48.199
The reason why it was fairly high for the first book is that I think they had a paperback floor of them, so they knew that.

38:49.140 --> 38:51.703
I think they had some good early responses.

38:52.932 --> 38:58.159
from booksellers with the galleys and then some early reviews.

38:58.179 --> 39:04.868
And then there were some magazines that were going to do profiles.

39:07.632 --> 39:12.979
And that was always, each of these would add a piece down.

39:13.339 --> 39:18.046
So what was your response to that?

39:18.606 --> 39:18.947
Were you shocked?

39:20.088 --> 39:22.011
Were you surprised at that?

39:23.442 --> 39:37.843
I think I was much more reasonable about it than most everybody else who was involved with it.

39:39.665 --> 39:42.730
It was possibly the exception of my answer.

39:42.750 --> 39:48.278
I thought, well, this is nice, but in another month after publication, I had to be off the shelf and forgotten.

39:48.298 --> 39:52.504
I had to go back to my other life and write these other things.

39:53.378 --> 39:57.462
And it's very practical about it.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.485
None of these hype dreams.

40:01.306 --> 40:07.792
I look at so many people today who write their first story.

40:07.912 --> 40:15.339
A friend of mine at Squaw Valley who's part of the staff that a young woman came up to me and showed them the story and she started critiquing it.

40:15.359 --> 40:18.402
And she burst into tears and he said, what?

40:18.783 --> 40:20.204
I think it's a good story.

40:20.224 --> 40:22.086
I just think it needs a little bit more work.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.681
You don't understand.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.284
I've been working on this since January.

40:27.725 --> 40:30.248
It was like February 6th.

40:30.388 --> 40:32.450
Yeah, you know, it was through.

40:32.470 --> 40:39.497
And I've talked to so many people who say things like, well, I'm really fairly reasonable.

40:39.677 --> 40:49.727
I'm not expecting a million dollars from my first book, but I figure I put in five years into this.

40:50.348 --> 40:56.917
I'd like to just get sort of a standard wage, like $20,000 a year.

40:57.498 --> 41:01.122
So $100,000 would be sufficient, I think.

41:01.142 --> 41:05.689
My God, you know, I mean these people have no idea what reality is.

41:06.329 --> 41:08.693
It doesn't usually happen that way.

41:08.713 --> 41:17.284
So here I'm the person who would have said, no, you know, you could expect to, if you're lucky to get $5,000 and sell 5,000 copies,

41:18.023 --> 41:25.434
and go back to, you know, security and... And the new judge, so to speak.

41:25.454 --> 41:46.005
Yeah, and you know, when they were selling foreign rights after a while, and I'd say to my husband, you know, oh, you know, they put something to England, that means that I can stay off work for another month, maybe start another book, you know.

41:47.335 --> 41:57.987
I figured I'd have to return back to my business by a certain period and earn some money.

41:58.088 --> 41:59.990
Things started happening after publication.

42:00.010 --> 42:13.606
Each time something happened, I'd say, oh, you know, I've bought me four more months, you know, I can stay home and write another book, you know, I may be able to print something out or something else.

42:13.846 --> 42:16.549
And then one day, it was like,

42:17.457 --> 42:27.511
It was amazing.

42:27.531 --> 42:36.584
But again, I have to tell you that it was these little sprites or spirits or whatever they are.

42:36.604 --> 42:37.906
One agent took me on.

42:38.827 --> 42:45.557
I didn't go with the agent when she first called me, because I told her I was a great kitchen writer.

42:46.769 --> 43:11.623
Well, I'm 43 now, so I started writing fiction when I was 33, and when the agent... My agent pursued me, but I ended up calling her back on a question of when something was reprinted, the Italian thing, reprinted without my permission.

43:14.086 --> 43:15.949
She came up and I met

43:16.722 --> 43:22.612
She lives down in Delmar.

43:22.632 --> 43:32.327
And after I signed on with her, I said, Lou and I were on vacation, and we're walking around the lake in the mountains, and I said, I want you to remember this conversation.

43:32.948 --> 43:40.240
I said, because something very strange is happening in my life, and I don't understand it.

43:40.861 --> 43:42.644
What is it?

43:42.664 --> 43:43.185
I'll just try to remember.

43:47.553 --> 44:02.634
Something is, someone is pushing me to do this writing, and even if I didn't want to do it, I'd have to do it, because so far, look at what's happened.

44:03.234 --> 44:10.084
I haven't been involved in it, and it just kind of comes, so.

44:10.104 --> 44:11.726
Do you have a sense of these spirits?

44:11.926 --> 44:16.092
I do have a very strong sense of it, and that's why I finally let Gallup

44:16.375 --> 44:33.262
the desk and said, okay, you wanted me to be a writer, you want me to write this story, and I'll write this story, and come and give me your ideas.

44:33.282 --> 44:34.744
So I sit down and read this kind of wonderful time writing it.

44:34.764 --> 44:35.225
Who did you write here?

44:35.245 --> 44:35.545
Sandra Dykstra.

44:35.565 --> 44:43.598
She also represents Maxine Hock-Houston, Susan Faludi, a number of people filling in.

44:44.472 --> 45:04.193
Do you read any of your contemporaries for pleasure, or do you approach, do you look at all of your novels as a craftsman trying to figure out like a watchmaker?

45:05.454 --> 45:07.897
No, I couldn't do that.

45:08.297 --> 45:10.259
I get tired of reading that.

45:10.299 --> 45:12.141
There is a book that I've read from Kraft.

45:12.862 --> 45:13.703
I fall asleep.

45:14.257 --> 45:19.142
about 10 pages into it, and I never tire of reading it, those same 10 pages.

45:19.723 --> 45:21.605
It's Horde Maddox for the Good Soldier.

45:22.666 --> 45:30.174
I think that book is so seamless, at least it must be the rest of the way through.

45:31.516 --> 45:39.805
I just start reading this, and I do look at the craft of how he does this.

45:40.526 --> 45:41.867
But you know who I think does it?

45:43.450 --> 45:49.636
Even better, it's Kazuyo Ishiguro.

45:49.937 --> 45:56.103
I can't help but sit back every now and then admire this craft.

45:56.223 --> 45:59.587
But I just get stuck to the story, too, and just read.

45:59.607 --> 46:01.188
And that's what I have to do.

46:01.228 --> 46:02.610
Jamaica Kincaid is the same way.

46:03.130 --> 46:05.973
I'm reading the book now.

46:05.993 --> 46:10.538
And I just, it's pure pleasure that every now and then

46:10.788 --> 46:15.513
I go back and I read the page just for the crowd.

46:16.414 --> 46:16.715
It's beautiful.

46:16.735 --> 46:27.587
When you go into reading stuff, do you read different things, or do you have pretty much a reconnection of what you love to them?

46:27.607 --> 46:32.552
I like to read stories about childhood and different backgrounds.

46:32.572 --> 46:36.597
But it's anything that... Reviews do influence me.

46:36.617 --> 46:39.580
You know, if I read a good review

46:40.302 --> 46:43.787
the language is beautiful enough.

46:43.987 --> 46:57.908
I don't like books that are, where the language screams at you and says, pay attention to me.

46:57.928 --> 47:08.503
When you read from your own words, you have any specific, any favorite parts

47:08.804 --> 47:09.605
In your own work.

47:09.785 --> 47:11.126
Oh, in my own work.

47:12.948 --> 47:13.329
Yeah.

47:13.829 --> 47:14.790
That's interesting.

47:14.810 --> 47:20.016
Because I noticed you're ready to embark on a huge cross-country tour.

47:20.036 --> 47:21.938
I think you have a lot of reading schedule.

47:21.958 --> 47:22.238
Is that right?

47:22.519 --> 47:23.059
Yeah.

47:23.280 --> 47:27.064
I was talking to somebody about, what do you think I should read?

47:28.865 --> 47:33.090
You know, I read it out loud for the Dove audiotapes.

47:35.180 --> 47:47.794
And I proved the manuscript at the same time, and I asked the woman, who was the producer, you know, what part she thought I should read aloud.

47:47.814 --> 47:49.976
I still haven't decided.

47:52.119 --> 47:52.379
I don't know.

47:52.399 --> 47:55.162
Do you approach the evidence of a new book with almost any anxiety?

47:55.182 --> 47:58.766
Of course, you know that Peter is wonderful.

47:58.826 --> 47:58.926
Yeah.

48:04.627 --> 48:07.210
I had a lot of anxiety with the second book.

48:08.732 --> 48:11.976
The pressure was tremendous.

48:11.996 --> 48:16.602
And, you know, wondering what they'd say about it.

48:16.622 --> 48:20.947
And, oh, she was, you know, one book.

48:20.967 --> 48:30.178
The third book, I think I found more of a steadiness in my own mind and heart about what I'm doing.

48:32.858 --> 48:39.868
It was the right thing for me to do, no matter what.

48:39.888 --> 48:52.066
Because of everything that happened during the writing of this book.

48:52.087 --> 48:56.092
It's been an amazing period in my life.

48:56.112 --> 49:02.562
Just everything was handed to me, you know, in the way of troubles and luck and wonderful things

49:03.233 --> 49:09.520
I got the dog.

49:13.205 --> 49:25.219
I discovered a great love in my life.

49:25.359 --> 49:28.903
But the terrible thing is really also a wonderful thing.

49:29.795 --> 49:33.560
And I can't, I don't know if I really can talk about it.

49:33.581 --> 49:34.362
I'll tell you.

49:36.164 --> 49:39.810
My editor is ill.

49:39.830 --> 49:47.901
And the reason is really why I came to New York.

49:48.582 --> 49:49.504
I don't know how to do it.

49:49.524 --> 49:52.328
But she's doing fun, like a miracle.

49:52.348 --> 49:59.278
And I had to believe, to be loyal, to speak for everything I knew about unconditional love.

49:59.647 --> 50:27.392
I found myself getting on an airplane, coming to New York, I've never lived alone in my life, and walked into an empty apartment with my book still unfinished.

50:29.498 --> 50:37.689
When I landed here, I thought, what am I doing here?

50:37.929 --> 50:39.451
What am I doing here?

50:39.551 --> 50:42.535
I don't know how to pay bills.

50:42.676 --> 50:43.977
I don't know how to be by myself.

50:43.997 --> 50:46.441
What am I doing here?

50:46.461 --> 50:47.802
And everything became unimportant.

50:48.003 --> 50:48.644
All of that.

50:48.664 --> 50:50.066
To take care of her.

50:50.406 --> 50:56.434
To find a cute person.

50:59.654 --> 51:06.461
And she's doing well.

51:06.481 --> 51:06.922
She's doing excellent.

51:06.942 --> 51:07.142
Thank you.

51:07.162 --> 51:08.524
She was at the party last night.

51:08.624 --> 51:14.150
I mean, nobody would know she's still.

51:14.370 --> 51:15.371
She's doing great.

51:15.511 --> 51:20.657
Have you given me an hour of your time, so I'm going to stay my love when I want to get out of town with women?

51:21.378 --> 51:24.261
I wish I had a finished book for you to sign for me, but...
