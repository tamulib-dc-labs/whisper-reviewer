00:03.524 --> 00:10.153
It's our pleasure to be talking with Sanford Berger in Carmel, California.

00:10.173 --> 00:11.956
It's for the benefit of my title.

00:11.976 --> 00:12.857
Right.

00:12.877 --> 00:16.822
And you were telling my wife about the chair that you're sitting in there.

00:16.842 --> 00:22.190
Yeah, well, actually, he was primarily an architectural worker.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.012
We're talking about your father.

00:24.032 --> 00:24.893
My father.

00:24.913 --> 00:26.796
Things to be built into building.

00:27.938 --> 00:32.784
And rarely did he do furniture or free-standing sculpture.

00:32.804 --> 00:33.345
He did something like that.

00:34.625 --> 00:44.237
He loved doing pieces of building, and that's why he always pushed me into being an architect.

00:44.257 --> 00:44.538
I remember.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.120
And what was your father's name?

00:46.600 --> 00:46.901
Samuel.

00:48.322 --> 00:48.523
Samuel.

00:48.543 --> 00:52.828
And he worked all his career in San Francisco.

00:52.868 --> 00:55.972
He arrived there in 1904 from Romania.

00:56.653 --> 00:59.136
Really?

00:59.156 --> 01:01.159
Directly from Romania?

01:01.179 --> 01:04.463
From Romania, where his father was a wood powder.

01:05.033 --> 01:06.615
The father was apprenticed to him.

01:06.695 --> 01:16.028
So when he arrived in San Francisco, he was a 19-year-old, and then a journeyman would play.

01:16.048 --> 01:22.016
And he became the major carver in San Francisco.

01:22.036 --> 01:32.070
And if you're in San Francisco and have time to go to Grace Cathedral on Mount Phil, on each side of the choir,

01:32.793 --> 01:35.896
enormous organ screens, they're called.

01:36.597 --> 01:42.603
It's all the oak tracery that contains all the organ pipes.

01:42.623 --> 01:47.167
I can show you photographs when you don't show me.

01:47.187 --> 01:48.068
That's kind of a good job.

01:48.088 --> 01:54.394
So if you get into the Bohemian flood, all of these... Really.

01:55.435 --> 01:58.598
So from the very beginning, I gather, you had this

01:59.438 --> 02:03.924
Oh, there's a predilection to be in some aspect of design, I guess.

02:03.944 --> 02:04.404
Absolutely.

02:04.424 --> 02:16.619
Well, as I say, as long as I can remember, he had me either sitting on the bench watching him carve, and then later I could mark the wood for this.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.726
It ended up with a pretty good-sized shot, but then he could do 12 carvings.

02:23.208 --> 02:29.175
So all the stencil markings, I and my sisters got to do it.

02:30.539 --> 02:33.303
keep ahead of the time.

02:33.483 --> 02:36.807
But he always said, don't be a carbon, be the architect.

02:36.827 --> 02:40.131
He decides where the carbon is going to go.

02:40.211 --> 02:42.575
That was important.

02:42.595 --> 02:46.780
He taught me to draw more than he taught, even though I did some time.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.323
You make the sisters so you... Three older sisters.

02:50.084 --> 02:52.127
And one friend yourself?

02:53.168 --> 02:55.411
He wouldn't give up.

02:55.431 --> 02:57.894
This was very important to that culture.

02:58.615 --> 02:59.196
You weren't a

02:59.547 --> 03:04.233
You didn't prove you were a man until you had a son.

03:04.253 --> 03:08.218
There was actually another daughter who died when she was one-year-old.

03:08.418 --> 03:11.982
So he went through four girlism, wouldn't you?

03:12.443 --> 03:14.485
Did he meet his wife in California?

03:15.106 --> 03:16.368
Oh, that was another coincidence.

03:16.688 --> 03:22.275
She, too, came from Romania in the same year, but separately.

03:22.295 --> 03:26.620
They didn't know each other until they met in France this time.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.002
And became engaged.

03:29.551 --> 03:33.876
were separated during the 1960 earthquake for three days.

03:34.076 --> 03:40.723
So they found each other in the tent city of Golden Gate Park at the island.

03:40.743 --> 03:44.287
But both their houses had been destroyed.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.108
That's how they met?

03:45.268 --> 03:45.709
No, no.

03:45.729 --> 03:47.070
They were already engaged.

03:47.371 --> 03:48.892
Oh, I think so.

03:48.913 --> 03:52.977
And they finally found each other and got married right away.

03:53.547 --> 03:56.751
Was San Francisco a place where Romanians came?

03:57.071 --> 03:59.734
Generally, ethnic groups kind of go to the same places.

03:59.754 --> 04:02.858
There was quite a large group that came.

04:02.918 --> 04:09.867
I'm not sure who started it, but once, as you say, a group gets started, they keep coming.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.069
And is Briga the family name?

04:12.450 --> 04:18.097
I think it got modified way back.

04:18.197 --> 04:22.542
To avoid conscription.

04:23.213 --> 04:28.358
There were lots of reasons for changing names.

04:28.378 --> 04:33.042
Let's talk about the development of a passion.

04:33.422 --> 04:49.637
Well, I guess you could say our first collection was when we furnished our apartment in Cambridge.

04:50.037 --> 04:50.638
Really?

04:51.749 --> 04:58.014
with all the, I'd say, museum pieces of the international style.

04:59.376 --> 05:08.804
The Nelson desk, and the Eames chairs, and the Sarah, and then Scherz-Long, and the Calder Mobile.

05:09.064 --> 05:10.605
Which you're pointing to.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.127
Right.

05:12.147 --> 05:12.447
Thank you.

05:12.747 --> 05:19.073
And the Brock section over the fireplace.

05:19.093 --> 05:21.655
Just all these choice pieces

05:23.643 --> 05:27.929
and all the exhibits of modern furniture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

05:29.050 --> 05:33.476
Those were all the things that we assembled to live.

05:33.496 --> 05:35.299
This is about when, by the way?

05:36.681 --> 05:45.132
We both arrived at Harvard Graduate School of Design in August 41.

05:45.152 --> 05:48.216
And you know what happened in December 41.

05:49.630 --> 05:53.815
And so I did not get to finish my year's master's.

05:53.835 --> 06:04.489
See, I already had a master's from Eugene Berkeley in architecture.

06:04.509 --> 06:07.853
So I had one year's for a master's.

06:07.873 --> 06:12.199
Instead of an MA, it's called an M-Arch degree.

06:12.219 --> 06:16.144
But I completed only half of it.

06:18.470 --> 06:38.074
I guess it was the federal government came to all the architecture and engineering schools, recruiting people to pass back on, to come to MIT, four months course, six days a week, eight hours a day, ended up with a certificate at Naval Architect.

06:38.094 --> 06:48.207
And I worked the rest of the time that Helen completed her, you might say, undergraduate graduate degree within three years.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.685
I worked at the Boston Navy.

06:50.865 --> 06:56.332
I didn't know what that was.

06:56.652 --> 07:02.820
At the end of which I got drafted into the Navy.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.945
But then the war was over a year later.

07:07.065 --> 07:08.447
And we came back to that.

07:08.888 --> 07:11.091
Is that your career as architect?

07:11.291 --> 07:11.872
As architect?

07:11.892 --> 07:13.193
Both working in San Francisco?

07:13.213 --> 07:13.374
Both.

07:13.394 --> 07:14.675
Well, San Francisco or Oakland.

07:14.815 --> 07:16.377
But based in the Bay Area.

07:16.658 --> 07:17.238
But they are.

07:17.258 --> 07:18.480
And we lived in Berkeley.

07:18.815 --> 07:27.302
that ended up for 31 years before we moved here, I think, for the sake of 15 years ago, I think.

07:27.322 --> 07:46.038
15 years ago, mainly because Berkeley became, I don't know what the right word is, infested or came down with cancer and no longer was the Berkeley we chose to live in.

07:46.278 --> 07:48.400
It became the People's Republic of Berkeley, you've heard this,

07:49.460 --> 07:55.368
reference to it.

07:55.648 --> 08:05.000
I don't know if you ever knew Berkeley in its earlier times, but it was in the late 40s.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.564
Well, it was like a Cambridge of the West, right?

08:07.584 --> 08:07.764
Exactly.

08:08.665 --> 08:09.126
It was.

08:10.588 --> 08:13.732
It was the best place to go on with.

08:13.992 --> 08:17.897
So, that's why we decided it's never going to recover, so we have to go on.

08:19.042 --> 08:23.348
Are you looking also for a place to bring the large collection?

08:23.368 --> 08:25.231
No.

08:25.251 --> 08:31.479
As a matter of fact, it's a disadvantage for scholars that the collection is here.

08:31.860 --> 08:37.748
Because this is an awkward distance from the Bay Area.

08:37.768 --> 08:47.361
You know, two and a half hours drive is a... And if you're going to do a one-day visit, you've got five hours of driving for maybe

08:47.763 --> 08:58.953
Three or four hours at the most, which is not good for a scholar who can't afford to rent a motel and all the rest of it.

08:58.973 --> 08:59.733
But some do.

09:00.954 --> 09:03.316
Quite beautiful though, it's an agreeable drive.

09:03.336 --> 09:04.097
It's marvelous.

09:05.038 --> 09:09.362
But when we lived in Berkeley, it was just routine.

09:09.402 --> 09:14.526
There was always somebody there speaking through some aspect or other.

09:14.546 --> 09:16.808
What was it your intent?

09:17.108 --> 09:20.133
to assemble a collection.

09:20.193 --> 09:24.701
That would be so important that scholars would have to consult it.

09:24.782 --> 09:29.550
If they wanted to write about William Morris, they would have to consult their collection.

09:29.570 --> 09:39.167
I've got to let you read the preface for the catalog of the exhibit that UC Berkeley put on.

09:40.328 --> 09:45.894
the books at the Bangkok Library and all the decorative art at the UC Museum.

09:45.914 --> 09:46.175
Contact.

09:47.496 --> 09:50.439
And the catalog is published.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.161
All of them.

09:52.181 --> 09:52.321
Really?

09:52.341 --> 09:54.223
And who published the catalog?

09:54.243 --> 09:54.724
UC Bank.

09:54.744 --> 09:59.229
And I might be able to get a copy of it.

09:59.249 --> 10:01.391
Those things disappeared.

10:01.432 --> 10:05.015
They kept horrific to get a hold of it.

10:05.116 --> 10:09.360
The best I could offer to do, I can do a Xerox of this process.

10:09.380 --> 10:09.981
That would be great.

10:10.315 --> 10:28.482
Because it explained that no way was there ever an intentional form in a collection.

10:28.662 --> 10:36.293
The only reason I'm hesitating, you could learn a heck of a lot more quicker if you read it.

10:36.313 --> 10:38.196
Well, I'll certainly get it.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.785
I'm still looking for reflections.

10:40.805 --> 10:46.832
The way we got started in New York, that's what I was going to say.

10:47.452 --> 10:54.340
The only thing we started collecting was all the international style furniture, because that's the way we were designing.

10:54.520 --> 10:59.405
The only fit environment.

10:59.425 --> 11:08.014
But in 1960, we happened to be in New York, Museum of Modern Art,

11:09.479 --> 11:15.286
put on an exhibit of their own collection of our new old furniture and objects.

11:17.629 --> 11:24.017
So we went to the Museum of Modern Art the way we do whenever we're in New York.

11:24.037 --> 11:27.001
Here's this exhibit.

11:27.021 --> 11:29.324
Something about it grabs folks.

11:32.007 --> 11:33.288
And we bought the tabloids.

11:34.810 --> 11:36.212
And we came back.

11:36.614 --> 11:47.304
said something like, well, maybe we could look around and see if we can find some piece of Arniveau as a sort of souvenir reminder of this great exhibit.

11:48.686 --> 11:50.608
You know, Arniveau had never been important.

11:50.668 --> 11:55.532
You touch on it when you study history of art and architecture.

11:55.552 --> 11:59.276
Just the way you would touch on William Morris can go right on.

11:59.296 --> 12:02.780
The way you would touch on the pre-racial arts.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.941
Pass right over them.

12:03.961 --> 12:05.322
There's nothing really important.

12:05.909 --> 12:09.353
So that's what he had to do.

12:09.373 --> 12:15.260
So here we came back and we did find a salt and pepper shaker.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.883
And that was the beginning.

12:17.904 --> 12:24.071
And for the next five years, it became serious.

12:24.231 --> 12:33.182
Included in things like getting into furniture, like that corner cabinet and the pieces of gallet glass sitting on it.

12:34.259 --> 12:38.383
And then there's Tiffany and all the rest of it.

12:39.625 --> 12:44.149
Very serious collections.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.373
This is 1960 to 1965.

12:48.134 --> 12:58.304
Like we'd be in Boston with a dealer, mainly just an antique dealer, because there were no real specialists in the 90s.

12:58.324 --> 13:01.768
Not many people were interested in that.

13:02.153 --> 13:15.407
He said, well, he didn't have anything, but he knew that in Kennebunkport, there was a dealer who had a barn, and he had a load of barns.

13:15.727 --> 13:17.348
So I rented a car in Boston.

13:18.189 --> 13:20.091
Helen didn't want to bother driving up.

13:20.111 --> 13:30.642
I drove up there alone and brought back that lamp that's sitting right next to you there, and the tallest of the gal, a whole bunch of people.

13:32.157 --> 13:34.780
So that's how crazy it was done.

13:34.941 --> 13:40.748
But by this time, you had been an architect for at least, I don't know, 20-odd years.

13:40.788 --> 13:41.109
Sure.

13:41.129 --> 13:44.113
And, of course, you didn't say serious collecting, and you mentioned Tiffany's.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.434
Accumulated.

13:45.454 --> 13:46.055
Accumulated.

13:46.075 --> 13:50.781
I mean, the means were such, now, that you could afford... We could do it.

13:52.884 --> 13:57.270
But people have been throwing Tiffany's in our house.

13:57.858 --> 14:01.883
Stickley's a fast move.

14:02.384 --> 14:27.274
Even more so, what's become the current rate is the, I guess it's referred to as the Mission-style furniture, Stickley in New York, and then he moved to New Jersey, or even Albert Hubbard in East Aurora.

14:27.895 --> 14:36.443
Well, that stuff was pure junk powder, and now that stuff is crazy.

14:36.463 --> 14:40.327
Were you cognitive of fashion, or were you oblivious to it?

14:40.627 --> 14:42.048
There was no fashion.

14:42.068 --> 14:42.469
But what else?

14:42.509 --> 14:44.030
But you were still collecting the pieces.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.393
Oh, because they just felt good.

14:47.413 --> 14:53.619
So you weren't really influenced by what was... There was no... There was still no interest.

14:53.699 --> 14:56.502
When you go into an antique theater,

14:56.819 --> 14:59.822
and asked to have him in Arneville because there was something exciting.

15:01.283 --> 15:05.407
He said, oh, yeah, when I bought this house full of stuff, there were a couple of pieces.

15:05.427 --> 15:09.771
You want to go in the back storeroom and look around, you might see it.

15:09.791 --> 15:15.337
So that's where we did a lot of marvelous, very economical purchases.

15:15.357 --> 15:18.320
And you knew, of course, that you were getting timeless things.

15:18.960 --> 15:26.067
Well, by then we started to buy Arneville books, books about Arneville.

15:26.283 --> 15:45.525
from the photograph to really recognize the various designers and some of the characteristics.

15:45.545 --> 15:49.550
So we knew what we were looking for in finding, you know, like Ellen got hooked on inkwells.

15:49.690 --> 15:53.574
I don't know how many of them are, but they must be 40 inkwells.

15:53.594 --> 15:54.736
And now you go try to buy an inkwell, you can't find one.

15:54.756 --> 15:55.176
You can pay for it.

15:55.780 --> 16:03.091
It was an exciting treasure, truly treasure.

16:03.111 --> 16:05.715
Pretty much, yes.

16:06.896 --> 16:10.481
Any favorites among the pieces here?

16:10.602 --> 16:20.055
That you inspired that period?

16:20.376 --> 16:22.840
Do you like them when you like them?

16:22.860 --> 16:24.522
They're like children, right?

16:24.788 --> 16:26.490
This is a lamp I didn't see.

16:27.711 --> 16:28.912
How would you describe that lamp?

16:29.833 --> 16:30.614
Well, let's see.

16:30.634 --> 16:36.280
I think it's referred to as etched glass.

16:36.300 --> 16:48.053
It came from... See, there were two major glass designers in the town of Nancy in France, N-A-N-C-Y.

16:48.073 --> 16:53.479
And Galet, G-A-L-L-L-E with the accent, he was the primary.

16:54.218 --> 16:59.124
designer, and then Dome Brothers, C-N-U-M, or the other one.

17:01.366 --> 17:16.583
And then later we went to Nancy, went to the Dome factory in the house, and then they'd taken over one of the marvelous Arniveau designs, huge residences, and it's not a museum.

17:19.787 --> 17:20.968
Anyway, Arniveau is done.

17:21.657 --> 17:25.863
Before I could get here, I don't mean to break up the train, but just tell me briefly what kind of wood that is.

17:25.883 --> 17:27.646
This is Longwood.

17:27.666 --> 17:31.551
And if you try to give a name to this style, I think it would be Tyrone.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.577
Is that your favorite chair in the room?

17:35.657 --> 17:39.302
Is that the chair you enjoy your father's chair?

17:39.523 --> 17:40.805
It does.

17:40.825 --> 17:43.849
A Baroque chair with carved heads, I guess?

17:44.009 --> 17:46.172
Yeah, Cupid's.

17:46.192 --> 17:49.137
And all you see is a three-piece set.

17:49.157 --> 17:50.078
These two...

17:52.336 --> 17:54.519
These two birds sit on either side.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.124
That's why this is a... Oh, look at the birds.

17:57.304 --> 17:58.566
It's funny.

17:58.766 --> 18:00.449
Your dad did those too.

18:00.549 --> 18:01.791
It's a three-piece set.

18:03.053 --> 18:04.255
They'd be on either side.

18:04.315 --> 18:06.358
And they're meant to be seats as well.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.600
I see.

18:07.620 --> 18:12.348
What kind of birds are they, would you say?

18:12.428 --> 18:12.648
Eagles?

18:14.852 --> 18:15.773
Yeah.

18:16.675 --> 18:19.980
See, and they're the same matching Cupid head.

18:20.686 --> 18:21.927
on those as well.

18:21.947 --> 18:33.358
See, so the arc of this and this is really a handsome assembly.

18:33.378 --> 18:35.420
We've had them rearranged.

18:39.044 --> 18:46.030
They were an anniversary present for my mother one day.

18:46.050 --> 18:46.731
Pretty nice.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.672
That's a very touching present.

18:49.238 --> 19:02.452
And as I say, it was unusual to have furniture, the only furniture that they have.

19:02.472 --> 19:13.064
But he just, well, didn't get around to doing furniture because he was always just a piece of the building.

19:13.104 --> 19:13.524
Yeah, it was.

19:13.544 --> 19:17.929
So we're looking now to try and understand

19:18.196 --> 19:21.740
how you made this, you were a serious collector.

19:22.020 --> 19:28.066
That's the first time we realized that we had this problem.

19:28.566 --> 19:29.367
Problem.

19:29.727 --> 19:33.731
Addiction.

19:35.433 --> 19:38.816
And you were addicted equally, by the way.

19:38.896 --> 19:39.137
Yeah.

19:39.177 --> 19:43.401
Absolutely.

19:44.642 --> 19:45.503
Then the

19:46.242 --> 19:52.369
dealer in Paris who specialized in both Oriental Art and outside of him.

19:52.389 --> 19:58.496
I was his major and his minor was Art Nouveau.

19:58.516 --> 20:08.969
And he showed us at his own apartment, Art Nouveau designed books that we had never seen.

20:08.989 --> 20:16.097
So when we came back from that trip, pursuing Art Nouveau's books is where, by accident,

20:16.668 --> 20:29.899
came across a facsimile of a William Morris printed book, The Gorge of Chaucet.

20:29.919 --> 20:30.460
That's right.

20:31.961 --> 20:44.392
And that had been, it was sort of a three-quarter, but very faithful, well done facsimile.

20:44.412 --> 20:45.713
And I bought that

20:47.617 --> 20:57.791
and read just quite an extensive introduction that the publisher had put into this facsimile.

20:57.811 --> 21:05.042
Facsimile introduction all about Morris's activities.

21:05.382 --> 21:10.890
So then the next thing was, well, let's maybe get a real Tom Scott Press book.

21:14.819 --> 21:20.207
And I went to what was then John Howell's books.

21:22.170 --> 21:28.219
Warren Howell was the son of John Howell who was deceased.

21:28.239 --> 21:34.949
But Warren Howell had become the major bookier in San Francisco.

21:37.633 --> 21:44.083
And I went in and this young fellow who I learned later had just started to work with.

21:45.447 --> 21:52.153
And I asked, did they have any Telstra Pressbooks?

21:52.173 --> 21:53.475
It just happened to them.

21:53.495 --> 22:04.845
He opened this door to this bookshelf, and they had just taken in on consignment.

22:04.865 --> 22:15.015
I think it was 51 or 53 of the 66 volumes.

22:15.282 --> 22:16.103
At one lock.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.184
They were all away.

22:18.345 --> 22:19.065
Were they in a vault?

22:19.646 --> 22:22.808
No, they were just there in the bookshelf.

22:22.828 --> 22:25.371
It was behind the door that looked like a door to a room.

22:30.115 --> 22:44.867
So, that meant I came by three successive extended lunch hours and looked at every single night and finally picked up this marvelous example

22:45.792 --> 22:49.095
There was no Kelmscott Chaucer there.

22:51.177 --> 23:08.553
But I picked out The Life and Death of Jason, which was one of the large corridors, or small folio, inscribed to Berne Jones from W.M.

23:08.573 --> 23:13.538
It had Berne Jones' Kelmscott Crest bookplate, basically.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.303
That's a pretty main story.

23:15.363 --> 23:17.145
So it was mint.

23:17.165 --> 23:18.487
I'll show you.

23:18.507 --> 23:19.127
Still is.

23:20.289 --> 23:21.450
So fine, you know.

23:21.570 --> 23:24.033
This that's the Morris collection.

23:24.894 --> 23:28.319
No, this was just buying one Tom Scott's best book.

23:28.339 --> 23:31.903
Because if you were buying Morris, you'd have bought the whole, you'd have bought the 53 boxes.

23:31.923 --> 23:33.705
That came three weeks later.

23:34.727 --> 23:36.629
That was the start of the collection.

23:37.670 --> 23:42.276
No, this was just intended to have one example of it.

23:42.931 --> 23:50.822
So those three weeks were sort of crawling up the wall.

23:50.842 --> 23:55.027
What happened within the intervening three weeks is what I'd love to know.

23:55.047 --> 23:57.070
What's happening to you at this time?

23:57.410 --> 23:58.251
What do you think?

23:59.073 --> 24:03.499
What's the reverse of withdrawal symptoms?

24:03.519 --> 24:04.320
Acceleration.

24:04.940 --> 24:08.365
Anticipation symptoms that I finally

24:09.374 --> 24:12.358
It was overwhelming when you went back and bought it.

24:12.378 --> 24:19.306
Well, something's happened in here, though, because you've been an art collector, you've been a furniture collector, items, artifacts.

24:19.386 --> 24:21.248
Yeah, but this wasn't Art Nouveau, really.

24:21.548 --> 24:21.969
Oh, really?

24:21.989 --> 24:22.509
And it's a book.

24:23.170 --> 24:23.891
And it was a book.

24:24.532 --> 24:39.229
Although we were, I should explain, during the Art Nouveau period, the 60 to 65, did get involved with Beard Slew,

24:40.357 --> 24:46.063
and the yellow book, which was also because of Beardsley.

24:46.083 --> 24:56.935
And let's say an extensive library about Arneville, all the books that existed at that time.

24:56.955 --> 25:08.608
So it was a pretty impressive couple of bookcases for both about and also good examples of books.

25:09.297 --> 25:13.363
I had never considered it a book collection.

25:13.383 --> 25:16.167
It was just a collection of objects.

25:16.187 --> 25:18.971
So what happens when you bring that first book home?

25:18.991 --> 25:24.819
And then it's three weeks, you say, of accelerating whatever the emotion is.

25:24.980 --> 25:26.222
What are you thinking?

25:26.702 --> 25:27.563
What's happening?

25:27.824 --> 25:32.330
How is it that Morris infected you so thoroughly?

25:32.350 --> 25:37.818
I'm wondering if you've got to intellectualize this at all.

25:37.858 --> 25:39.000
What happened in those three weeks?

25:39.723 --> 25:46.990
I know part of it was the incredible similarity to my father's drawing.

25:47.631 --> 25:52.736
He could draw very much like the Count Scott Borders.

25:53.917 --> 26:00.924
My father would decorate my sister's and my book covers.

26:00.944 --> 26:07.671
You know, when you go to school, and they issue textbooks, and they tell you to put butcher papers and covers on them.

26:08.984 --> 26:13.750
And then my father would enjoy decorating those colors.

26:14.491 --> 26:18.416
I wish I had had one of those, but I don't.

26:18.436 --> 26:22.001
You know, book covers get torn and wasted.

26:22.021 --> 26:23.663
That flashed back in your mind, though.

26:23.683 --> 26:27.108
You probably hadn't even thought of that for 30 years.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.411
But it looked so much like my father's job.

26:29.431 --> 26:30.012
Something happened.

26:30.072 --> 26:32.114
Yeah, but when you see the window, Marla's stuck.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.997
You never forget it.

26:34.097 --> 26:35.258
Yeah.

26:35.299 --> 26:36.240
You think that was it?

26:36.260 --> 26:37.441
That was part of it.

26:37.862 --> 26:37.962
Yeah.

26:38.617 --> 26:59.919
But the other thing, there was something about having handled that many Telmstam Press books in that short a period that there's some kind of transference of realization that these are jewels.

27:00.180 --> 27:01.261
These are important.

27:03.023 --> 27:07.307
These are like handling a marble

27:08.266 --> 27:13.994
figurine or something.

27:14.014 --> 27:18.020
And I chose to remember that, because you're giving me children by sharing it.

27:18.441 --> 27:21.165
So finally it was uncontainable.

27:21.185 --> 27:25.791
I went and brought home these cardboard boxes.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.255
Did you discuss this with your wife?

27:28.355 --> 27:33.102
Sure, she had to write the check.

27:35.325 --> 27:35.826
At the same time,

27:36.312 --> 27:59.350
kind of thing happen, you say, oh, there's been lots of, what I understand, I didn't invent this, the book collector who sneaks home with the book under his coat and gets into the library and gets it on the shelf so that she doesn't see him bring it in.

28:00.089 --> 28:01.651
You know, there's been a lot of those.

28:01.911 --> 28:04.635
But when it's this major, you can't sneak in.

28:04.795 --> 28:07.899
I think it was three cardboard boxes.

28:07.919 --> 28:14.788
Or when we did buy the Morris Archives of the Decorating Press.

28:14.808 --> 28:15.629
This came later.

28:15.649 --> 28:17.772
That came a few years later.

28:18.233 --> 28:21.197
About three or four years later.

28:21.217 --> 28:23.900
She had to be in a match.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.584
That was the most single major.

28:27.725 --> 28:30.028
So they were 43 of what, 60s?

28:30.751 --> 28:35.878
No, it was 50-some or 60-some books.

28:36.578 --> 28:41.304
And then Warren Howell picked up one at a time in the remainder until we had them all.

28:43.567 --> 28:47.653
You got the Chaucer from Hawaii?

28:47.673 --> 28:48.353
Oh, well, here.

28:48.574 --> 29:00.589
First he got a Chaucer bound in the gray boys, just gray cardboard with a linen spine.

29:01.379 --> 29:22.777
See, they printed 425 paper copies, and all but 46 of them were bound in this form, which is basically intended to be a protective binding until you take it to your own binder and have your own binder put on.

29:22.797 --> 29:30.424
But Morris did have 46 of those paper copies bound

29:30.725 --> 29:38.376
in this white pigskin binding that Morris himself designed.

29:39.338 --> 29:45.347
He did design a couple of minor bindings, but this one was a real major one.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.468
Did they call it vellum?

29:46.488 --> 29:46.648
No.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.852
No, it's white pigskin.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.614
I thought it was vellum.

29:52.637 --> 29:52.737
No.

29:53.479 --> 29:59.888
The way that Kelmscott Press books were issued was either in these gray boards or

30:00.239 --> 30:04.803
in Vella, just a flat plain sheet of Vella, undecorated.

30:06.445 --> 30:08.407
But the Chaucer was not.

30:09.048 --> 30:11.350
The Chaucer was not issued in Vella.

30:11.370 --> 30:13.973
It was either the boards or these 46 copies.

30:13.993 --> 30:19.718
So anyway, Howell first got a copy of the Chaucer in boards.

30:19.738 --> 30:21.180
It was sort of beat up, but okay.

30:21.200 --> 30:28.727
This would do with the understanding that when a better boards copy came along, or if possible,

30:29.365 --> 30:30.446
We would trade it in.

30:30.466 --> 30:34.170
Warren would take it back.

30:35.851 --> 30:48.784
So then Warren knew of this American living in Montevideo, Uruguay, who, I guess, getting old and decided to sell his libraries.

30:49.124 --> 30:58.613
Warren went down there, flew down there, and bought a number of things, but he carried in his hand this copy that we had.

31:01.495 --> 31:11.144
You look like you're ready for lunch.

31:11.164 --> 31:13.787
You went out and investigated.

31:13.827 --> 31:15.769
You researched a lot of the things.

31:15.809 --> 31:18.051
This possession wasn't enough for you, I gather.

31:18.071 --> 31:19.332
You had to know.

31:19.372 --> 31:22.195
You had to know what you're looking at.

31:22.215 --> 31:24.057
That's what you were collecting, by the way.

31:24.197 --> 31:27.440
I think it's unavoidable.

31:27.941 --> 31:29.782
See, my dad did those two bags.

31:29.963 --> 31:31.384
Oh, that's been wonderful.

31:31.718 --> 31:37.044
And he did this right away.

31:37.064 --> 31:38.406
Take a look on this one.

31:38.426 --> 31:42.190
As you see, he does a drunken Bacchus.

31:42.211 --> 31:43.552
Oh, boy.

31:43.572 --> 31:44.794
I'm just going to write that down.

31:44.834 --> 31:45.835
Yeah.

31:45.855 --> 31:47.116
Drunken Bacchus.

31:48.158 --> 31:53.324
He's designed to fit on the end of an elliptical wine barrel.

31:53.344 --> 31:56.247
You probably had to get these from other people who own them.

31:56.267 --> 31:57.008
No, no.

31:57.028 --> 31:58.570
These are things he still had in the shop.

31:59.697 --> 32:12.633
See, this piece was carved for William Randolph Hearst's place up near Mount Shasta.

32:12.653 --> 32:15.897
He had San Simeon and he had Wyn Toon.

32:16.497 --> 32:17.118
Wyn.

32:17.298 --> 32:18.940
W-Y-N-T-O-O-N.

32:19.141 --> 32:23.686
What would you call this?

32:24.127 --> 32:28.472
This is like a Bavarian Gothic braille, handrail.

32:30.275 --> 32:39.087
Julia Morgan was the architect, and by the time this had been carved, she had redesigned the bountaine, so this piece was abandoned.

32:39.407 --> 32:41.009
Ah, it was in the shop.

32:41.550 --> 32:51.623
It was in the shop, then we had it in our house in Berkeley, and then we moved it.

32:52.705 --> 32:53.165
Okay.

32:53.486 --> 32:56.109
This is piece number one of the Art Nouveau collection.

32:56.450 --> 32:57.531
This is the way it started.

32:58.321 --> 33:01.444
Two salt and pepper shakers, right?

33:01.464 --> 33:02.586
Yeah.

33:02.606 --> 33:03.707
And what is the material?

33:04.488 --> 33:05.228
Is it silver?

33:05.248 --> 33:06.169
Yeah, it's sterling.

33:07.211 --> 33:11.395
It needs to be polished.

33:11.415 --> 33:18.863
But then you get things like this fantastic, which is the structure is a piece of crystal.

33:18.883 --> 33:20.265
Oh, wow.

33:20.525 --> 33:22.967
These straps hold the top and bottom together.

33:23.748 --> 33:27.252
And her hair was originally gramey.

33:27.432 --> 33:28.193
It was gold.

33:28.679 --> 33:32.863
But her hair makes, that's what it looks like.

33:32.883 --> 33:33.724
It holds up the candle.

33:33.744 --> 33:34.124
Look at the hair.

33:34.144 --> 33:35.185
Look at the hair.

33:39.189 --> 33:39.649
Look at the hair.

33:39.669 --> 33:40.390
Look at the hair.

33:40.410 --> 33:40.830
Look at the hair.

33:40.850 --> 33:43.753
Look at the hair.

33:43.953 --> 33:46.315
Look at the hair.

33:46.335 --> 33:46.896
Look at the hair.

33:46.916 --> 33:49.158
Look at the hair.

33:53.422 --> 33:57.606
Look at the hair.

33:58.531 --> 34:27.660
The reason we have it, I made the drawing.

34:27.826 --> 34:29.349
Oh, really sorry.

34:29.770 --> 34:38.827
We got to know an Italian man who grew up in his house as a kid when he wanted to restore it in his home area.

34:38.847 --> 34:47.224
He had to, as you always do, had to submit his proposal to the local restaurante.

34:47.905 --> 34:48.566
The restaurante?

34:48.747 --> 34:49.007
I'm sorry.

34:49.848 --> 35:10.539
So he needed a drawing, and so when we were staying with him at his villa outside of Buchanan, I would sit and draw this, and he would describe the changes he was planning, and I would incorporate that.

35:10.560 --> 35:18.792
So then they finally executed the place, and there's a restaurant in the lower floor, and they had the drawing made into the place.

35:23.227 --> 35:49.065
I have the Book of Minutes.

35:49.366 --> 36:12.420
from the company in which on the very first page it says the names of the designers will be withheld from the public in other words you're hiring morrison company so to answer your question though the figure was designed by sir edward jones okay now

36:12.805 --> 36:29.108
That's a 50, that's a straight 50, which is not a Y, it's a regular one, yeah.

36:29.128 --> 36:32.413
You're looking at it, this end lady here, see?

36:32.974 --> 36:38.261
So there are five figures standing on top of five more, and then there's the rose.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.364
Now we have the entire window.

36:40.584 --> 36:41.766
And where was the window?

36:42.337 --> 37:11.398
from a unitarian church in haywood near manchester england you went to england and acquired this from a dealer who had bought it at auction of properties see the building had to be condensed so the windows were removed but the thing that's intriguing

37:12.712 --> 37:23.028
The dealer, or let's say some of these, had each of these 10 figures as a separate lot.

37:23.348 --> 37:27.575
And then the top, I think, was a separate lot.

37:27.695 --> 37:38.892
So this dealer had to bid on each of these 11 separate lots in order to keep the window in crack, and he managed to do it.

37:39.292 --> 37:40.474
So that's the first case.

37:41.045 --> 37:46.712
But then he had them in his shop for almost two years.

37:46.732 --> 37:53.621
See, these are separate panels, and they were just stacked in the back storeroom again.

37:53.641 --> 37:53.721
Wow.

37:53.741 --> 37:55.283
He hadn't figured out a way.

37:56.185 --> 37:58.447
I'd made these trains myself.

37:59.329 --> 38:02.893
He hadn't come up with a system for displaying them.

38:03.494 --> 38:07.960
So that's why he had just sort of let them sit there.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.702
So I came to the shop.

38:10.002 --> 38:14.987
because somebody told me they had some Morris ceramic.

38:15.007 --> 38:16.228
And you discovered these.

38:16.388 --> 38:22.575
The woman, when she was riding up the sail swift for the tiles, said, oh, by the way, would you be interested?

38:22.595 --> 38:25.297
Did you break into a cold sweat when these things happen?

38:26.659 --> 38:34.447
So what happened was, she had the 8x10 photos that had been used in the Sotheby's catalog.

38:35.628 --> 38:38.811
And this was a morning when I was going to meet Helen for lunch.

38:39.972 --> 38:44.998
So I said, yeah, you know, after I pulled a couple of panels off.

38:45.218 --> 38:50.685
I said, can I take the photo with me to show it to my wife?

38:50.705 --> 38:56.772
Which I took it, bought her a drink, took the photo out of the envelope and said, I bought it.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.576
And she said, that's nice, thinking I had bought the photo.

39:01.618 --> 39:03.741
Oh, I bought the rooms.

39:03.761 --> 39:06.884
You know, this is 11 feet by 18 feet.

39:07.005 --> 39:08.667
How about all these parts up here?

39:08.687 --> 39:09.928
Did you get those two?

39:10.702 --> 39:21.755
See, this is at Stanford in 1975, and they put on an exhibit, so they built a frame working from the suddenly photograph.

39:21.775 --> 39:24.178
At least that frame, that would be kind of nice to have.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.419
They broke it down.

39:25.659 --> 39:29.103
Where are you going to put it?

39:29.123 --> 39:30.405
In a church, I guess.

39:30.425 --> 39:31.866
Couldn't find a church to buy.

39:33.749 --> 39:39.375
But they had this marvelous art gallery with the big sky to be lighted from behind.

39:39.946 --> 39:43.209
I couldn't find a church to buy.

39:43.330 --> 39:44.271
You added to buy.

39:44.391 --> 39:47.814
It wouldn't be in the goodness of your heart to donate it to a church.

39:48.055 --> 39:51.899
Get out of your mind.

39:51.919 --> 39:53.921
Then we couldn't live with it.

39:53.941 --> 39:57.645
Now this has been one of the best things about it is living this year.

39:57.705 --> 40:07.195
And what's really fantastic is we raised three boys with all this stuff.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.177
And in all their lives,

40:09.410 --> 40:12.695
Only one piece ever got dumped in it.

40:12.855 --> 40:14.237
I can't believe it.

40:14.337 --> 40:16.841
What was that piece?

40:16.861 --> 40:18.103
I don't know.

40:18.844 --> 40:20.186
I ask every question, don't I?

40:20.327 --> 40:24.252
Hey, these dragonflies here.

40:24.272 --> 40:30.822
I'll show you what got there.

40:30.842 --> 40:31.363
I did save all the pieces.

40:31.383 --> 40:32.224
You saved all the pieces?

40:32.265 --> 40:34.187
No, I say I did not save all the pieces.

40:34.508 --> 40:35.890
They were just smithereens.

40:37.574 --> 40:40.158
Well, it wasn't a Morris piece, anyway, was it?

40:40.178 --> 40:41.780
No, it was a galet piece, though.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.541
That's pretty good.

40:43.062 --> 40:48.010
Yeah, and that's very... Here we go.

40:49.191 --> 40:50.253
See the dragonflies?

40:50.493 --> 40:54.079
It was one of those etched glass balls on it.

40:55.861 --> 40:59.347
And it got knocked over just first.

40:59.427 --> 41:01.590
What happens when, well, how do you feel when that happens?

41:02.684 --> 41:04.106
When it happened, it's his.

41:04.246 --> 41:05.228
Thankfully, it's only a year.

41:05.308 --> 41:13.299
I can't remember how long we had him up in the thumb hangers.

41:13.419 --> 41:18.987
Oh, yes, it's identical.

41:19.007 --> 41:20.129
What we're looking at is what?

41:20.149 --> 41:21.110
That's a bee.

41:21.130 --> 41:21.731
A little lamp.

41:22.152 --> 41:25.316
But I mean, this particular thing that you're holding.

41:25.336 --> 41:29.402
These are dragonflies.

41:29.422 --> 41:30.403
Dragonflies, okay.

41:30.543 --> 41:31.645
Well, hey, one.

41:32.435 --> 41:40.264
By having each one of them, when they got to be about 16 or so, come work in my office for the summer.

41:40.465 --> 41:41.246
That was a mistake?

41:41.346 --> 41:43.308
I turned them off.

41:43.428 --> 41:47.433
They saw all the dog work involved.

41:47.553 --> 41:51.438
But you don't wear a beret and a snot.

41:51.458 --> 41:53.540
Raise your phone.

41:55.162 --> 41:59.067
He had to do something about the state of printing.

41:59.637 --> 42:03.361
Morris had lived many years of his life.

42:03.381 --> 42:03.561
Go ahead.

42:03.942 --> 42:25.446
And when he finally did get around to designing the books, he had this enormous background as a designer of fabrics, tapestries, stained glass windows, all of these things.

42:25.466 --> 42:29.070
So as he said, he couldn't help

42:29.641 --> 42:36.071
but lavish his skills on the printed page.

42:38.235 --> 42:49.372
And he was able to do it like nobody ever did before or since because of this whole lifetime of genius designing.

42:49.392 --> 42:53.038
See, his true genius was two-dimensional design.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.323
He barely ever designed

42:56.928 --> 43:04.897
anything three-dimensional, a piece of furniture, even though he started out wanting to be an architect.

43:04.917 --> 43:23.279
But his true genius came out as a two-dimensional designer better than anybody before or since, in the form of the glass, the tapestries, the woven and printed fabrics and the wallpapers.

43:23.299 --> 43:25.922
But he was so disturbed

43:27.252 --> 43:39.189
when they would have an exhibit of good printing, well printed books, that none of his own writings ever appeared in one of these exhibits.

43:39.209 --> 43:51.927
So first he decided he'll try to work with the best printer at that time in terms of doing some type of graphic design with them.

43:53.611 --> 44:03.061
Because, you see, for relaxation, he had been doing illuminated manuscripts for over 20 years before he started the film's podcast.

44:03.081 --> 44:04.062
That's amazing.

44:04.082 --> 44:14.973
So, he already had very, let's say, a deep knowledge of good typographic design because of his study.

44:16.074 --> 44:19.218
Well, it's pretty, it goes straight all the way down.

44:19.238 --> 44:22.521
Because of his study of manuscripts and

44:23.817 --> 44:40.875
See, like his third library was assembled as source material for good typography in the form of manuscripts and the impunables in the early printed books.

44:40.895 --> 44:47.823
And the majority of that library is now at the Morgan Library in New York.

44:47.843 --> 44:51.006
We have, I think, six of the books.

44:54.395 --> 44:55.116
You have six?

44:55.477 --> 45:02.288
Six that were in his library at the time he died.

45:02.309 --> 45:02.809
That's pretty impressive.

45:02.829 --> 45:03.230
Yeah, I'm impressed.

45:03.250 --> 45:03.471
Impressive?

45:03.491 --> 45:04.232
I'm delighted.

45:04.252 --> 45:05.113
I'm paying attention.

45:05.133 --> 45:08.219
I want you to know he can get six of Loras' own books long.

45:08.519 --> 45:09.080
I'm delighted.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.564
With his Kelmscott Press book played in it.

45:11.584 --> 45:11.745
Wow.

45:12.205 --> 45:15.311
That's amazing.

45:15.331 --> 45:15.872
This is beautiful.

45:15.892 --> 45:16.633
Isn't this?

45:16.653 --> 45:17.815
It's splendid.

45:17.835 --> 45:19.558
Now we can turn off the tape.

45:21.310 --> 45:51.165
now that kelp's kelp which is rooted in the bottom and it stands up like a forest and every year this specially designed ship comes and harvests it has a great it looks like an old rear paddle wheel but it's actually scooping it into an endless belt that hauls it into the into the smells too doesn't it we love that and what do they do with it medicinal and i think

45:51.567 --> 45:54.630
The Orientals have some food use for it.

45:54.670 --> 45:56.032
So they actually are harvesting.

45:56.132 --> 45:57.814
Oh, harvesting for commercial crops.

45:57.834 --> 45:58.895
They're not trying to remove it.

45:58.915 --> 45:59.476
They're harvesting.

45:59.496 --> 45:59.796
No, no.

45:59.816 --> 46:02.399
As a matter of fact, it causes more growth.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.883
See, now, if you look up here, look to your right.

46:06.063 --> 46:08.626
There you see Tor House and Hawk Tower.

46:08.646 --> 46:08.826
Wow.

46:09.587 --> 46:10.087
Yeah, I know.

46:10.127 --> 46:11.549
Can you look at that?

46:12.230 --> 46:14.352
I will take a picture of it, too.

46:14.372 --> 46:19.658
And I will, by the way, will not mention that you're adjacent to that because I might as well give them your address.

46:21.440 --> 46:21.540
Yeah.

46:22.904 --> 46:42.631
We're looking at some sketches that Mr. Burger did, and these are travel sketches, and I said, you are an artist, and I said, but I think it energizes the collecting spirit in your case, and your answer was... I realize how hard it is to do what Morris has done, because I've tried it.

46:42.651 --> 46:44.293
And you mentioned your father, too, again.

46:44.353 --> 46:48.439
My father started me drawing as early as I can remember.

46:51.288 --> 46:55.853
Well, if you're real good children, I'll give you copies of those.

46:56.414 --> 47:00.559
I'd rather never put them on the wall.

47:01.820 --> 47:05.344
Here's Helen, before and after.

47:05.364 --> 47:18.780
We were visiting in Vicenza, a woman who was a counter, who outgrew all her Dior's and Chanel, so they were playing dress-up, and Helen's got this great Dior thing with the...

47:19.486 --> 47:20.967
with the coronet on.

47:21.007 --> 47:24.951
So I got it, took them out and about me, and that's in the arrangement from the slide.

47:26.953 --> 47:27.554
That's nice.

47:32.458 --> 47:32.738
Isn't that it?

47:32.758 --> 47:36.662
That's where you designed the picture for the restaurants.

47:36.682 --> 47:37.042
Yes.

47:37.142 --> 47:38.203
Vicenza, I think.

47:38.224 --> 47:39.365
Vicenza.

47:39.385 --> 47:39.765
Vicenza.

47:39.785 --> 47:40.546
Vicenza.

47:40.766 --> 47:44.730
No, that's very cool.

47:44.750 --> 47:46.832
Oh, it's carpet.

47:46.852 --> 47:48.413
I feel the quality of that.

47:50.485 --> 47:57.273
Yeah, would you hit the switch?

47:57.293 --> 48:02.339
Good.

48:02.359 --> 48:19.260
This is a full-size, you're familiar with the Easter word cartoon, of course, by Morris himself, whereas this, and I should have pointed out the two in the dining room, on either side of those windows,

48:20.033 --> 48:22.416
the cartoons by Glenn Jones.

48:24.578 --> 48:27.622
This is using Mrs. Morris as the model.

48:28.784 --> 48:31.847
What are the initials?

48:31.967 --> 48:33.289
Figure portfolios.

48:33.309 --> 48:38.495
They had a numbering system of filings.

48:38.515 --> 48:42.240
And they also had SP for subject portfolio.

48:42.280 --> 48:45.263
That was for groups of figures.

48:45.283 --> 48:48.387
And LP was the third, the large portfolio.

48:48.957 --> 48:50.899
And Morris did this one himself.

48:50.919 --> 48:52.001
That is Morris' own time.

48:52.842 --> 48:52.982
Wow.

48:57.848 --> 48:59.270
Wow.

48:59.290 --> 49:03.374
That's Bern-Jones.

49:03.395 --> 49:07.900
And these are all Bern-Jones studies for various things.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.522
Four, five, six Bern-Jones.

49:09.642 --> 49:10.483
Oh, there's one here.

49:10.503 --> 49:11.845
It's kind of in this wall.

49:11.865 --> 49:12.045
Oh, yeah.

49:19.737 --> 49:20.898
Yes, just look.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.561
He's talking about economy of line.

49:23.581 --> 49:24.662
Look what he achieved.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.830
Yeah.

49:32.850 --> 49:37.655
And he didn't start drawing until he was out of college.

49:37.675 --> 49:38.395
He was just there.

49:38.696 --> 49:39.056
Out of college.

49:40.177 --> 49:40.858
Look at these studies.

49:40.958 --> 49:43.280
They're a figure for a campus, too.

49:43.300 --> 49:43.761
Look at the difference.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.002
And position.

49:48.290 --> 49:50.832
Is there an adequate biography in your view of William Morris?

49:51.893 --> 49:53.254
Is there an adequate biography?

49:53.294 --> 49:54.015
Yeah.

49:54.215 --> 49:56.417
There's so many.

49:56.437 --> 49:57.378
What's your favorite?

49:57.398 --> 49:58.119
Do you have a favorite?

49:58.499 --> 49:59.340
I like Henderson's.

50:00.421 --> 50:04.324
1967, I think it came out.

50:05.205 --> 50:07.367
I'll bet you could write a life, write something.

50:07.387 --> 50:15.054
I'm not a writer.

50:15.074 --> 50:16.255
These are all reproductions.

50:16.758 --> 50:18.640
that I have hanging up.

50:18.660 --> 50:19.541
They're pretty, you know, in groups.

50:20.082 --> 50:20.983
They're beautiful, though.

50:21.003 --> 50:30.032
But it's fun to see things like this, where the same design, a light background and a dark background, how different elements become the dominant.

50:30.053 --> 50:31.574
It's the exact same design.

50:33.076 --> 50:35.078
Here you're aware of these things.

50:35.098 --> 50:40.384
Here you're aware of the surface.

50:40.404 --> 50:42.126
What kinds of flowers are you filming?

50:42.226 --> 50:43.067
Definitely.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.090
And this is fun when it's all

50:46.272 --> 51:01.251
Now, these three drawings here are by Morris, and I refer to these as Greatly Studies.

51:01.271 --> 51:04.916
And these are the concept stage for a design.

51:04.936 --> 51:08.661
These happen to be for stained glass window figures.

51:09.662 --> 51:15.570
This is a photograph of a full-size final cartoon here.

51:15.888 --> 51:24.801
You can see by the fact that every last little fold ends up in the final design.

51:24.821 --> 51:34.234
It's a good evidence that these were in large photography, which Morris's neighbor had the big photo of the great business.

51:34.254 --> 51:36.838
And Morris used photography in all his work.

51:36.858 --> 51:39.982
And you had these slug drapery studies at St.

51:40.002 --> 51:40.463
Cyprian.

51:40.483 --> 51:43.988
C-Y-P-R-I-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A-N-E-R-A

51:44.727 --> 52:05.305
And he wouldn't bother going into the detail of the head or sometimes the hands until you get to the full slides or the detail of his palms.

52:05.325 --> 52:06.847
You do this grouping though?

52:07.047 --> 52:08.849
No, at one of the exhibits.

52:08.869 --> 52:11.771
That's one of the nice things about loading things for exhibits.

52:11.791 --> 52:13.292
It comes back modern.

52:13.413 --> 52:13.873
That's right.

52:14.208 --> 52:16.550
And grouped rather nicely, too.

52:16.570 --> 52:21.075
Well, I decided on the group.

52:22.256 --> 52:30.824
But we have 140 of the Morris figure Jones that were part of the art track.

52:30.844 --> 52:35.990
Whereas, I think the Victoria and Albert has the next most, and they have seven.

52:36.010 --> 52:36.790
The next most?

52:36.810 --> 52:37.451
Did you get that?

52:37.791 --> 52:43.557
He has more than the Victoria and Albert.

52:43.874 --> 53:11.400
See, the thing that is special about our adventure, we have depth in every single one of Morris' activities, whereas you can go to a whole bunch of institutions that could have more than any one of them, but I don't know of any place that'll save you a lot of travel.

53:13.642 --> 53:21.789
And that gets involved with the question of, where do I look forward to this collection ending up?

53:21.930 --> 53:23.431
That's a question I assure you.

53:23.451 --> 53:34.701
Namely, because of Morris' wide range of activities, it is that buzzword, interdisciplinary.

53:35.902 --> 53:43.429
And I hope it can be placed in a suitable situation, probably in an institution,

53:44.067 --> 54:10.576
that will keep it all in one place so that you can look at the drawing and go see it in the illuminated page or in the window or on the drawing of the tapestry and not divide the drawings over to the art department and all the socialist pamphlets over to the history department and so on.

54:11.597 --> 54:12.758
It's got to be kept

54:13.565 --> 54:17.149
available in one place, like it is right here.

54:17.169 --> 54:19.432
But I think you would probably insist upon that, wouldn't you?

54:20.493 --> 54:22.555
You know, you can insist.

54:22.675 --> 54:23.376
Here's the other thing.

54:23.476 --> 54:33.227
Because we can't just give the whole thing away, it's going to have to be a donation slant purchase agreement.

54:33.247 --> 54:36.190
So that involves negotiating.

54:36.210 --> 54:40.315
So I'll try my best to make sure it comes out that way.

54:40.598 --> 54:47.386
Here's Captain Ahoy.

54:47.506 --> 54:49.749
He whispers lots.

54:51.731 --> 54:58.319
Well, the thing of it is, there's nothing here that's mediocre.

54:58.419 --> 54:59.961
Everything is of museum quality.

55:00.482 --> 55:02.604
He did everything class.

55:02.624 --> 55:06.008
Anything.

55:06.268 --> 55:09.272
Everything and anything.

55:11.125 --> 55:15.849
This house is filled with treasures.

55:16.110 --> 55:18.432
Yes.

55:18.452 --> 55:27.680
Part of the yarn invoking it is this important collection of mine.

55:28.101 --> 55:32.165
All of Eiffel's drawings and big books.

55:32.185 --> 55:34.287
His actual Eiffel's drawings?

55:34.307 --> 55:36.288
Well, no, prints of them.

55:36.308 --> 55:38.010
Prints of his actual drawings.

55:39.863 --> 55:45.030
My little son was very good at motocross.

55:45.631 --> 55:48.695
There's another before.

55:49.937 --> 55:55.104
Yeah, I thought that was pretty nice.

55:55.124 --> 55:59.149
Now here's part of the upper rows of the window.

55:59.169 --> 56:01.893
The upper rows of the stained glass window.

56:02.173 --> 56:07.120
Remember there are ten figures of him and the rows above.

56:08.416 --> 56:11.139
Look upstairs, looking out on the, you know, Jeffers' face.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.420
This is the upper part of that.

56:12.600 --> 56:22.770
See, upstairs you saw five figures, and you'll see the other five here, and in these two rooms, the voice.

56:24.192 --> 56:24.692
This is Helen's computer.

56:24.712 --> 56:25.173
Where she does that.

56:25.193 --> 56:26.314
Finance is in the pack.

56:26.474 --> 56:29.377
Oh, he writes the letters.

56:29.397 --> 56:30.278
This is one of their paintings.

56:30.378 --> 56:32.460
That should have been pointing out their paintings.

56:32.480 --> 56:34.982
Yes.

56:35.002 --> 56:37.545
These are moments.

56:38.892 --> 56:40.353
Actual Morris.

56:40.413 --> 56:43.156
Reproduction of Morris.

56:43.576 --> 56:47.500
Very accurate.

56:47.520 --> 56:50.543
Yeah, it's a Morris chair.

56:50.563 --> 56:58.811
You see the movable bar that tilts the bar is what's characterized as a Morris chair.

56:58.831 --> 56:59.571
William Morris.

56:59.731 --> 57:02.314
William Morris.

57:02.614 --> 57:02.914
William Morris.

57:02.934 --> 57:03.475
William Morris.

57:03.495 --> 57:04.696
You have a Morris chair.

57:04.716 --> 57:06.358
That's why you have a Morris chair.

57:06.378 --> 57:06.738
I never knew.

57:06.758 --> 57:07.819
He didn't design it.

57:08.322 --> 57:22.477
But his company used to like to give names to various chairs of Lange, and this was really a traditional chair, and when they started manufacturing their own version of it, they labeled it Morris chair.

57:22.497 --> 57:33.368
It's stuck ever since, and everybody makes their own interpretation.

57:36.908 --> 58:02.207
uh you are entering the first part of the scenic road press formerly the tunnel road press what he's telling you is that he's also this is this is your i can see why sid sid looks at you as a mentor we do a lot of similar things so these are all

58:02.558 --> 58:05.180
things I've set.

58:05.321 --> 58:05.861
The screw?

58:06.322 --> 58:11.646
My father did that, but it was done for a wine tasting room.

58:11.847 --> 58:14.189
You know, the wood screws for a wine present.

58:14.209 --> 58:19.474
So we're looking here at least 50, maybe 100 type papers.

58:19.774 --> 58:22.977
Mustard.

58:22.997 --> 58:29.143
Sandy, when did you start this after the Boris?

58:29.243 --> 58:29.443
Oh, yeah.

58:29.812 --> 58:35.059
So Morris inspired you to go and become— Well, first he inspired me to do good calligraphy.

58:35.340 --> 58:37.402
I'm a very good calligrapher.

58:37.422 --> 58:37.522
Okay.

58:37.542 --> 58:41.187
And then because you print it, I had to print.

58:44.752 --> 58:46.415
What room do we call this?

58:46.435 --> 58:48.698
This is the Scenic Rose Press.

58:49.318 --> 58:51.121
This is the Scenic Rose Press.

58:52.383 --> 58:54.546
What is your imprint, your cauliflower?

58:54.566 --> 58:54.866
Oh, yeah.

58:55.607 --> 58:59.312
I just say Scenic Rose Press.

59:00.355 --> 59:01.456
Oh, now this is earlier.

59:01.576 --> 59:04.219
Two hundred copies of a letter from the collection of San Bernardino.

59:04.239 --> 59:06.141
They're printed at the Tunnel Road Press.

59:06.161 --> 59:07.342
The Tunnel Road Press.

59:07.362 --> 59:09.644
Here it is, printed at the scenic road press.

59:09.664 --> 59:10.725
We live on Tunnel Road.

59:10.745 --> 59:14.029
Look at the quality it was printed.

59:14.129 --> 59:18.113
Here's my magnum opus.

59:18.133 --> 59:19.775
This was great.

59:19.795 --> 59:29.164
The Stanford Library Associates came to visit Tor House, and this I called Comscott Carmel, where you are standing.

59:29.498 --> 59:38.828
And there's a keepsake for their visit to both places.

59:39.629 --> 59:53.143
I borrowed from Jeffer's son his mother's travel diary about when the family visited May Morris at Kelmscott Manor in 1929.

59:53.798 --> 01:00:00.365
This is the picture of the old house by the Thames to which the people of this story went.

01:00:00.385 --> 01:00:09.334
Thereafter follows the book itself, which is called News From Nowhere, or an Epic of West, as written by William Morris.

01:00:09.354 --> 01:00:16.141
See, this is the frontispiece from the Comstock Press edition of News From Nowhere.

01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:17.362
That was a socialist novel.

01:00:17.903 --> 01:00:18.123
Beautiful.

01:00:18.143 --> 01:00:23.248
If you read nothing else of Morris, read that.

01:00:24.173 --> 01:00:32.723
But here's the only time I've used the bloomers.

01:00:32.983 --> 01:00:39.030
Those are blooming initials, referred to as bloomers.

01:00:40.611 --> 01:00:45.237
And this type is Troy type.

01:00:45.257 --> 01:00:47.259
Bloomers, which is short for?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.101
Blooming initials.
