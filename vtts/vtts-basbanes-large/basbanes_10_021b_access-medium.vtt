WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:05.004
She's not independent enough, she's not.

00:05.385 --> 00:07.087
She's too pretty and too sweet.

00:07.347 --> 00:13.517
But it certainly did occasion a resurgence of... Absolutely, no doubt about it.

00:14.418 --> 00:17.522
And it doesn't seem that she'll be showing any signs of letting her be there.

00:17.542 --> 00:28.158
No, because in the wake of all this, I've told you what Random House did, but Morrow then resuscitated behind a mask, which they had published 20 years before.

00:28.959 --> 00:32.805
And it's just out now in paperback again.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.965
and in hardback, and it did wonderfully.

00:35.985 --> 00:38.729
It was translated into German this time.

00:39.210 --> 00:41.513
I don't know what else.

00:42.274 --> 00:48.283
How about this new book, not new, the book that was founded at Harvard?

00:48.303 --> 00:49.044
The Inheritance.

00:49.064 --> 00:51.187
The Inheritance, which at Dutton is publishing.

00:52.248 --> 00:57.696
Well, The Inheritance, I had read it, and I mentioned it in my biography of

00:58.081 --> 01:03.928
I had read it when it was in the Orchard House, the manuscript, and I didn't think very much of it.

01:05.711 --> 01:12.640
What they've done is a charming book, beautifully manufactured, but I think it's a cream book.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.902
It's a sweet little book.

01:14.923 --> 01:20.049
I don't think Louise ever tried to get it published, and I think maybe she was right.

01:21.030 --> 01:26.317
But as long as... Well, it was a piece of juvenilia, I think, number one, right?

01:26.497 --> 01:27.058
Sort of.

01:27.359 --> 01:28.661
It is and it isn't.

01:28.681 --> 01:31.706
It's about lords and ladies in England.

01:31.726 --> 01:36.713
And it doesn't have much approach to reality, but it's pleasant.

01:36.754 --> 01:44.305
The people at Dutton would like you to believe that this is the story that's mentioned in Little Women, but I don't think so.

01:44.345 --> 01:45.427
It's not mentioned.

01:45.447 --> 01:47.871
Not mentioned as a story, but the one that she's working on.

01:47.931 --> 01:50.795
No, no, no.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.940
Much like that.

01:55.220 --> 02:03.071
But I mentioned it in my biography of her, just in passing, what she was doing then.

02:04.012 --> 02:08.939
And it's not her first book, it's her first novel, you might call it that.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.405
Her first book was Flower Fables, which was written when she was only 16.

02:15.148 --> 02:16.850
There's a lot of stuff here.

02:18.692 --> 02:22.037
I love the line where you said, you will become each other's eyes and ears.

02:22.726 --> 02:43.026
There's no reason to ask you things that you've already answered that you say most eloquently in the book.

02:43.046 --> 02:46.229
I mean, I'll be quoting generously from the book of this piece.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.230
We celebrate.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.813
We continue to celebrate.

02:50.266 --> 03:01.177
The thing is, you don't find... What we were doing, we had some project in mind, going through old titles and stuff.

03:02.539 --> 03:05.602
You don't find these books.

03:05.622 --> 03:20.037
You don't find the small, fascinating little book that is a link in the development, say, of a country or...

03:20.168 --> 03:22.230
They don't exist.

03:22.390 --> 03:23.892
They're not around.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.254
Is that the reason?

03:27.455 --> 03:28.396
I don't know why.

03:28.657 --> 03:29.177
I don't know.

03:29.237 --> 03:37.265
Either they're brought up by us, or the dealers don't bother with them.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.067
They don't bother with them.

03:39.087 --> 03:46.174
I'm talking mostly 17th century French mythology books.

03:46.195 --> 03:48.657
For instance, at one time,

03:49.396 --> 03:57.985
It was very, you saw it in catalogue after catalogue, the letters of a Portuguese nun, either in French or Italian.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.648
You don't see them at all.

04:00.668 --> 04:01.869
You don't see them.

04:02.209 --> 04:06.954
We would buy, could buy, say, six copies within two years.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.937
Now you don't see them in a catalogue.

04:10.037 --> 04:11.199
Well, this happens.

04:11.479 --> 04:18.306
Because the dealer doesn't want to waste his time with what I would call middle-class

04:19.400 --> 04:22.945
Most dealers want the good books.

04:22.965 --> 04:26.089
A lot of dealers restrict themselves to books in English.

04:27.291 --> 04:38.906
We have a customer, two customers, one for the Restoration of Charles II, covering the period 1660 to the 85.

04:39.187 --> 04:40.368
Yeah, but only in English.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.910
Only in English.

04:41.930 --> 04:48.259
Now, formally, you would see tract after tract, and you wouldn't even want to look at them anymore.

04:48.779 --> 04:50.421
If you see it, you don't see any.

04:51.002 --> 04:51.422
You don't see any.

04:51.903 --> 05:04.437
And if you do an English track, a track that formerly, well, it would catch, say, three, four pounds, it's now 30 or 40 pounds.

05:05.378 --> 05:07.440
And what is the American dealer going to do?

05:07.961 --> 05:16.391
If we buy an English track for 40 pounds, that is $100, right?

05:16.411 --> 05:18.313
40 pounds, 60 dollars.

05:18.682 --> 05:19.943
Yeah, it's 1.6.

05:20.304 --> 05:23.347
A pound is now 1.5, so that would be about $60.

05:23.367 --> 05:24.628
Oh, I'd say it's $60.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.293
It's worth about $30.

05:29.453 --> 05:34.237
What are we going to ask this customer?

05:34.258 --> 05:37.000
We can't ask them more than $75 or $80.

05:37.981 --> 05:44.488
So what profit is there by the time we pay the potions and everything?

05:44.508 --> 05:47.811
Another customer is only interested in one deal, etc.

05:48.567 --> 05:49.388
will you print?

05:49.948 --> 05:53.132
To find print is like finding a needle in their hands there.

05:53.652 --> 05:57.676
And when you do find them, it's just impossible.

05:58.637 --> 06:03.542
And, I mean, customers, of course, they get to the point where they're probably not going to spend it.

06:03.902 --> 06:17.376
What's happened, basically, is that formally you could buy abroad, pay, let's say, a decent price, and make some profit.

06:17.795 --> 06:26.366
Most of the American dealers are squeezed at, because the European dealer has your American customer in the first place.

06:26.386 --> 06:31.252
He knows who's buying William Grimm, and he knows who's buying Restoration.

06:31.272 --> 06:33.615
Well, that's quite a change then, isn't it?

06:33.635 --> 06:37.359
The European dealer now... Or, I don't think it's entirely correct.

06:37.379 --> 06:39.803
Well, it's to an extent correct.

06:39.823 --> 06:43.347
Or he charges so much that you're squeezed at.

06:44.889 --> 06:45.810
I mean, what's the use?

06:46.178 --> 06:50.864
a bus spending $300 for a book and charging $375.

06:51.005 --> 06:54.149
It makes no sense.

06:54.169 --> 06:56.092
Yeah, but it may be a lot of fun.

06:56.592 --> 07:00.337
It may be fun, but... We're not ready to give you one.

07:00.417 --> 07:08.949
And if a dealer buys it, and the salesman says, well, we own $375, what are you going to do for me?

07:08.989 --> 07:11.112
Are you going to give me at least 20% off?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.076
What profit do we have in my book?

07:15.237 --> 07:17.480
That's what's happening.

07:17.500 --> 07:23.848
Unless you go over and start carrying on yourself.

07:23.868 --> 07:26.912
By the way, when you were in London, did you see Steve Wiseman?

07:26.932 --> 07:27.252
I did.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.475
How is he happy?

07:30.036 --> 07:32.820
He just, he and his wife just bought a house.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.342
Yeah.

07:36.404 --> 07:37.646
Quite, great.

07:38.147 --> 07:39.488
But it was huge.

07:39.628 --> 07:43.293
It's maybe 50 or 60 of these big biocaps.

07:43.393 --> 07:44.755
You know, there's a bio...

07:45.511 --> 07:53.359
all the records of every book he ever handled and sold in his notes, and that would be a very interesting archive, wouldn't it?

07:53.380 --> 07:55.662
We bought quite a few of them.

07:55.682 --> 08:14.202
To show you what a man he goes like was, we were visiting him, and Bellycup came up and said, oh, Dr. Fulton, John Fulton, the great medical collector, said, Dr. Fulton is downstairs.

08:14.603 --> 08:19.268
An American dealer would have said to us, jump out of the window and drop dead.

08:20.669 --> 08:24.733
He said, tell Dr. Fulton that Ms.

08:24.793 --> 08:25.394
Stern and Ms.

08:25.494 --> 08:29.979
Robsonberger are here and we should come back another time.

08:29.999 --> 08:30.699
How do you like that?

08:30.719 --> 08:31.340
Yes.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.543
And that showed the greatness of the man.

08:34.563 --> 08:37.787
He didn't care whether it was Fulton or Mohammed or whoever.

08:37.807 --> 08:38.147
He was busy.

08:38.507 --> 08:42.231
We were there and he was giving us his full attention, I assure you.

08:42.565 --> 08:46.590
We would not buy in the way that the folks would buy.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.832
We'd buy a hobby first.

08:49.574 --> 08:51.197
But this was he, he goes.

08:51.477 --> 08:54.401
He was interested in the person.

08:54.421 --> 08:57.585
And he did not particularly like him.

08:57.825 --> 08:59.247
But he was very fond of us.

08:59.468 --> 09:00.569
He was fond of you.

09:00.729 --> 09:02.191
He was fond of both of us.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.037
And he gave us great feelings now.

09:06.057 --> 09:10.142
And, I mean, his knowledge and his book

09:11.894 --> 09:20.825
Well, we write in the book, it was really like going to God for us, and Dr. Brahe was very charming.

09:20.845 --> 09:28.975
He was from Munich, and he used the German word, very good English.

09:29.055 --> 09:35.543
He would have quarry with his wife, and his brother gets thrown around.

09:36.404 --> 09:41.310
And it was all very delightful, and he was very, he would drop

09:41.543 --> 09:48.453
pearls, you know, just tell you about a certain book or so forth, so on.

09:48.473 --> 09:48.674
Marvelous.

09:49.895 --> 09:54.021
I think... I mean, these were the great, great dealers.

09:54.342 --> 10:08.563
You mentioned when I came to see you about five or six years ago that you, I think it was the one that you actually, you remember going to see BG over at Belle Green at

10:09.185 --> 10:14.431
at the Morgan Library and how curious she was.

10:15.613 --> 10:17.054
Well, when I worked for Reisner.

10:17.455 --> 10:18.496
That was when you worked for Reisner.

10:18.516 --> 10:22.942
Because he sold to the Morgan quite a bit, well, more than we ever did.

10:24.243 --> 10:30.551
And she was a very imposing person and very, very frightening.

10:30.571 --> 10:33.975
And I came to the threshold of one of them.

10:34.956 --> 10:38.280
She had to use one of those magnificent rooms as her office.

10:38.733 --> 10:47.982
And I came to the threshold, and she looked at me and said very imperiously, come directly into my presence, young lady.

10:48.002 --> 10:52.886
I dropped the book like a hard potato.

10:52.906 --> 11:02.435
But later on, Maddie and I attended a lecture at the morgue, and when Goldschmidt was talking, and the two of them walked down the aisle again.

11:02.455 --> 11:04.057
It was very touching.

11:04.077 --> 11:05.398
They were old, and

11:05.868 --> 11:11.235
Of course, those men had some wine in the morgue with some of its finest books.

11:11.255 --> 11:14.139
It was very, very touching to see the two.

11:14.760 --> 11:24.473
Long after that, Cass Canfield of Harper asked me to write a biography of Velda Costa-Green.

11:26.356 --> 11:32.905
And I said I would if... I said we would if...

11:33.475 --> 11:39.663
If the materials were made available to us, I had a very strong suspicion they would not be.

11:40.424 --> 11:42.887
That's why there's never been a real biography written of her.

11:42.907 --> 11:44.769
It should be a wonderful subject.

11:44.789 --> 11:46.231
Marvellous.

11:46.631 --> 11:50.416
Actually, I have all the correspondence and everything.

11:50.436 --> 11:52.098
I was turned down flat.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.981
They claimed to have no material.

11:55.302 --> 11:56.323
Oh, yeah.

11:56.343 --> 12:00.428
Daddy Adams, Reed was then living in Switzerland.

12:00.948 --> 12:02.070
He said, there's nothing.

12:02.510 --> 12:03.992
He said, don't.

12:04.213 --> 12:04.914
He said, don't.

12:05.094 --> 12:05.515
Stop.

12:05.635 --> 12:05.995
Don't.

12:06.316 --> 12:07.337
Don't bother him.

12:08.239 --> 12:09.400
And I didn't.

12:09.761 --> 12:10.642
But you've got a copy.

12:10.662 --> 12:12.425
But now, I got one.

12:12.585 --> 12:14.248
You had got a copy.

12:14.368 --> 12:24.783
Oh, meanwhile, I've gotten a copy of her will, which had a lot of interesting suggestions in it to me.

12:24.883 --> 12:27.747
I couldn't act on anything.

12:27.808 --> 12:29.470
She had Jean Strauss.

12:30.108 --> 12:33.733
She's supposed to be doing a mortgage.

12:33.953 --> 12:34.514
Yes.

12:34.534 --> 12:36.777
She's been working on it for years.

12:37.538 --> 12:40.963
And she has made great discoveries about... Really?

12:41.123 --> 12:42.365
Well, I can't wait to see that.

12:42.465 --> 12:44.507
I'm not going to reveal the liquid.

12:44.868 --> 12:51.597
But in the will, she refers to her jewelry acquired at Cartier's.

12:52.719 --> 12:53.720
From Cartier's.

12:53.740 --> 12:54.761
From Cartier's.

12:55.562 --> 12:57.465
Now, a librarian

12:57.935 --> 12:59.216
I cannot afford it.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.037
Well, that's all right.

13:00.057 --> 13:02.780
She... She was a unique woman.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.462
A remarkable woman.

13:04.502 --> 13:08.225
Why they should put thumbs down on this, I don't know.

13:08.266 --> 13:09.867
What a story she would be.

13:09.887 --> 13:10.688
Fascinating.

13:11.148 --> 13:14.752
So, and just... She was not just a lawyer.

13:14.972 --> 13:17.535
Oh, I think we all suspect that.

13:17.615 --> 13:19.537
The question is, what, you know.

13:20.238 --> 13:22.420
So, you think Jean will have all of this in her new book?

13:22.520 --> 13:27.385
Jean said to tell him that she was a wonderful job, that she's got quite some

13:27.668 --> 13:29.009
How's she coming with that book?

13:29.510 --> 13:30.091
She's coming.

13:30.111 --> 13:32.093
She hopes to finish it in June.

13:32.433 --> 13:32.653
Oh, good.

13:32.733 --> 13:33.474
So, be along.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.058
Her Alice James book was just wonderful.

13:37.078 --> 13:39.741
Remember the book she read on Alice James?

13:39.761 --> 13:39.901
Mm-hmm.

13:39.921 --> 13:41.183
You know, the sister of Henry.

13:41.223 --> 13:42.604
She's a very charming woman.

13:42.724 --> 13:45.247
Yeah, I interviewed her on that, because I do a weekly book call.

13:45.687 --> 13:50.773
I think I've got plenty of material, and if it's okay with you, I'd like to shoot a couple of pictures.

13:50.993 --> 13:51.454
Sure.

13:51.614 --> 13:53.035
I would love to sign the book.

13:53.055 --> 13:54.537
I would love to sign the book.

13:55.613 --> 13:58.757
Did you say that again, please?

13:59.318 --> 14:02.963
He said, in this... We're talking about... Let's set the scene again.

14:03.003 --> 14:03.604
Who are we talking about?

14:03.624 --> 14:05.026
You want to take this.

14:05.186 --> 14:06.208
This sounds wonderful.

14:07.409 --> 14:17.403
Rajner said to Lessing Rosenwald, in this very suit, Herr Rosenwald, I escaped from the Nazis.

14:17.423 --> 14:23.812
Well, I looked up because he had bought that suit at Broad Street a week earlier.

14:23.912 --> 14:24.473
That's

14:24.638 --> 14:41.960
and Lessing Rosenwald, the tears ran down his cheeks, and he bought a very rare, I think it was an incunable, the first musical work of Gavurius, for about a thousand dollars, because he was so moved.

14:42.721 --> 14:46.005
Poor Mr. Reich and his

14:46.373 --> 14:48.235
escape from the Nazis.

14:48.256 --> 14:50.338
He didn't escape from the Nazis at all.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.764
He took refuge in Switzerland for a year before he came over here.

14:55.525 --> 15:01.213
So, anyway, Rosenwald, of course, fought copiously.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.297
Marvelous.

15:04.317 --> 15:05.378
Yeah, he was amazing.

15:05.579 --> 15:06.920
Now, there's one I missed seeing.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.703
I missed Rosenwald.

15:08.763 --> 15:09.884
I missed John Fleming.

15:09.904 --> 15:11.166
I mean,

15:11.551 --> 15:17.877
I missed being able to, you know... You talked about Priscilla Jougallis.

15:18.038 --> 15:20.500
Priscilla Jougallis worked for farming.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.741
That's right.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.024
I would love to have been able to talk to him.

15:24.885 --> 15:28.288
And his stuff is still sealed, you know.

15:28.308 --> 15:28.829
Still sealed.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.050
Here at the Grozier Club.

15:30.190 --> 15:35.395
Well, of course, it's a direct line from Rosenbach.

15:35.415 --> 15:38.018
That's... Flemming worked for Rosenbach.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.560
He brought him in as a kid, I guess.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.001
He was...

15:41.588 --> 15:55.841
We have a book in here that should be in the Grosier Club, speaking of the Grosier Club, because their copy is miserable, and this copy was owned by Ho.

16:00.565 --> 16:01.827
How would you spell preeminent?

16:01.847 --> 16:04.689
P-R-E-E, right?

16:04.769 --> 16:07.712
How would you spell preeminent?

16:07.892 --> 16:09.253
P-R-E.

16:09.273 --> 16:10.014
P-R-E.

16:10.474 --> 16:11.055
Just one A?

16:11.305 --> 16:11.826
You think?

16:11.846 --> 16:12.787
Preeminent.

16:12.807 --> 16:14.089
I think there's a height.

16:15.470 --> 16:16.111
I think.

16:16.532 --> 16:19.015
Well, I'm going to put one, okay?

16:19.035 --> 16:24.101
There's that diuresis or something.

16:24.121 --> 16:24.942
Or two dots.

16:25.964 --> 16:26.705
And I'm wild.

16:26.765 --> 16:30.850
I don't know.

16:46.287 --> 16:52.677
This copy of our Fournier, Emmanuel Typographique, was owned by the founder of the Grosje Club.

16:53.278 --> 16:54.760
And why they don't buy it?

16:55.061 --> 16:56.783
Well, I know why they don't buy it.

16:56.803 --> 16:58.025
They don't want to pay for it.

16:58.566 --> 17:00.569
They want it given to them.

17:01.491 --> 17:01.631
Oh.

17:04.014 --> 17:09.864
All those millions of members of the Grosje Club.

17:09.884 --> 17:11.366
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

17:11.486 --> 17:14.050
You would think so.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.557
Untight founding, that's how it all began.

17:20.340 --> 17:42.246
Gorgeous car.

17:42.366 --> 17:43.648
Oh, excuse me, Peter.

17:52.403 --> 18:18.360
You read the book for Doubleday, right?

18:21.766 --> 18:26.372
we suggest this?

18:26.613 --> 18:27.814
No, I called them, in fact.

18:27.854 --> 18:30.678
I called the Biblio just as soon as I heard.

18:31.119 --> 18:32.921
You know Marlee Russoff at Doubleday?

18:34.443 --> 18:36.046
Her name is Marlee Russoff.

18:36.066 --> 18:37.828
She's a vice president over there.

18:38.449 --> 18:46.039
She's a very good friend of mine, and she alerted me to this book, you know, and I said, thank you, and I'll do a piece for Biblio.

18:46.059 --> 18:50.946
So I called Biblio, and I said, look, if anybody else suggests it, just

18:51.837 --> 18:53.359
You know, let them know I'm doing it.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.986
Because I have a regular column every month at the front of a magazine.

18:58.007 --> 19:00.050
It's starting to get a lot of circulation, you know.

19:00.510 --> 19:02.313
I have my email address in there.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.959
I'm now getting 10 email letters a week.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.742
People just, yeah, from all over the world.

19:07.762 --> 19:08.763
We don't have email.

19:08.803 --> 19:10.105
We don't have a computer.

19:10.386 --> 19:11.968
We're very old British.

19:11.988 --> 19:13.410
We're going to get a computer.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.216
It's a little late in the day for us to stop.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.418
I don't think you need it.

19:20.170 --> 19:24.096
Well, now, for instance, Quaritch has its latest catalog.

19:24.116 --> 19:25.137
It's on the web.

19:25.598 --> 19:25.798
Yeah.

19:27.060 --> 19:28.622
And more and more will happen.

19:28.662 --> 19:30.625
You will be left out more and more.

19:32.708 --> 19:37.475
I'll never master it, but poor Maddie will have to.

19:37.495 --> 19:38.456
I can't.

19:38.496 --> 19:41.641
Of course, the kids, my young... They can teach you.

19:41.701 --> 19:43.704
It's amazing how they... I have problems.

19:43.724 --> 19:47.269
I yell for my younger daughter, Nicole, Nicole.

19:48.551 --> 19:50.093
I'll have to take a course of it.

19:51.338 --> 19:59.290
I have a cousin who's very active, and I'm so comfortable with both the typewriter.

19:59.310 --> 19:59.411
Good.

19:59.471 --> 20:00.593
Thank you.

20:00.733 --> 20:13.833
I'll give a couple of pictures.

20:14.895 --> 20:16.618
Okay, where do you want us to go?

20:16.918 --> 20:19.422
Well, let me just set up the camera.

20:20.245 --> 20:21.927
Up to the light or outside?

20:21.947 --> 20:23.790
I have a flash, so it doesn't really matter.

20:23.870 --> 20:25.872
So it doesn't matter what happens.

20:26.013 --> 20:27.555
It doesn't matter.

20:27.575 --> 20:28.736
I think where you're comfortable.

20:29.778 --> 20:31.780
This room is not meant for books.

20:33.943 --> 20:35.405
Well, my light went out.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.412
We'll have to try to replace it.

20:40.432 --> 20:41.473
So comfortable here.

20:42.535 --> 20:44.397
Get ready to mention something about this.
