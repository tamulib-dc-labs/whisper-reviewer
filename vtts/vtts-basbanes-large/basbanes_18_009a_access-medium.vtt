00:02.258 --> 00:04.141
Now talking to President Bulger.

00:04.181 --> 00:06.064
Congratulations, sir, on your book.

00:06.084 --> 00:06.585
Oh, thank you.

00:06.925 --> 00:13.796
You know, my specialty is books and authors, and I've done close to about a thousand interviews over the years.

00:13.836 --> 00:21.027
And one of the things I've been told is that one of the no-nos in publishing is to have a green dust jacket.

00:21.007 --> 00:26.853
But, of course, in your case, I think it's perfectly appropriate with the pub date being March 17th.

00:26.873 --> 00:27.254
Sure.

00:28.135 --> 00:32.560
I think it's also appropriate that today is a primary day in Massachusetts.

00:32.580 --> 00:32.860
It is.

00:34.301 --> 00:38.186
You want to talk a little bit about, if you don't mind, we'll just talk generally.

00:38.226 --> 00:44.332
Any thoughts about the day as the polls go into their second or third hour of being opened?

00:44.372 --> 00:48.617
Well, I think it's a very light day today.

00:50.015 --> 00:55.001
a bit heavy with the weather.

00:56.043 --> 00:56.964
Have you voted already?

00:57.124 --> 00:57.484
Yes, I have.

00:58.386 --> 01:01.870
It's just as hard as a Democrat to vote today, isn't it?

01:01.890 --> 01:04.834
There's not much beyond it, but locally there's a contest.

01:05.615 --> 01:06.977
My own son is on the ballot.

01:07.117 --> 01:07.497
Oh, really?

01:07.537 --> 01:08.478
For the state committee.

01:09.300 --> 01:15.788
And then on March the 26th, he'll be on the ballot again, seeking to succeed me.

01:16.789 --> 01:16.849
Oh.

01:17.129 --> 01:18.351
Special election.

01:18.483 --> 01:40.660
well congratulations it was his choice to do it and that's that's wonderful i love the early line in the book that uh you you decided that well this politics might even be more more fun than baseball yeah talk a little bit about that and and i also understand at some point you know i'd like to just maybe compare

01:40.640 --> 01:53.779
Massachusetts politics, and maybe even specifically South Boston politics, say, to the way it's played in Texas, or Austin, Texas, where I run, or, you know, I'm in Tallahassee.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.673
If you could just distinguish, and maybe this would be an entry point for our discussion here, what is it about South Boston politics that makes it unique?

02:04.174 --> 02:06.597
Well, politics is a...

02:08.247 --> 02:11.430
It's a very important part of the life of South Boston.

02:11.450 --> 02:14.874
People get into it deeply.

02:14.894 --> 02:15.795
They always have.

02:15.855 --> 02:31.451
There's a long tradition of political leaders from Speaker John W. McCormick, who, as you know, was a son of South Boston, and the dean of the governor's council was Patrick J. Sonny McDonough.

02:31.471 --> 02:36.516
The president of the Boston City Council right now is Jim Kelly from South Boston.

02:37.880 --> 02:51.560
And Joe Moakley, the congressman from South Boston, held a position of great prominence on the Rules Committee until the Democrats were driven out in the last election.

02:52.341 --> 02:59.872
So it's part of the atmosphere there.

03:00.893 --> 03:02.115
We can't get in with our...

03:02.855 --> 03:05.900
first gulps of the salt air.

03:07.101 --> 03:17.658
I don't know whether the piece was in the New York Times or the Globe Sunday, but it was really an interesting piece on just how hateful politics has become.

03:17.678 --> 03:20.943
In the old days, at least, I think you respected your opponents.

03:21.704 --> 03:21.924
Right.

03:22.084 --> 03:27.192
And did you feel some of that when you decided to leave and

03:27.796 --> 03:29.898
Yeah, well, I think it had changed a great deal.

03:29.958 --> 03:35.203
One of the problems, I think, is that it's been depersonalized.

03:36.264 --> 03:50.498
That is to say, we have all the consultants, we have the spin doctors, we have the pollsters, and people obey their dictates.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.302
And could I just shut the door here for a minute?

03:54.322 --> 03:54.782
Sure.

04:12.515 --> 04:14.077
People here are doing my work.

04:14.097 --> 04:16.940
I appreciate it, but I get distracted by it.

04:17.741 --> 04:25.190
No, I think one of the things that I didn't like was that good people would become candidates.

04:25.791 --> 04:38.566
They'd abandon all sense of right and wrong because, after all, this is the advice of the consultant to whom you pay a great deal of money.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.370
And whatever he says goes.

04:43.666 --> 04:51.337
If he says that this particular person is wounded, his blood is in the water, he's an unpopular figure, go after him.

04:52.579 --> 04:56.225
Even if he has nothing to do with your particular campaign.

04:57.266 --> 05:02.795
If someone provides that kind of advice and you're paying for it, you follow it.

05:04.337 --> 05:09.184
And what if someone were to say, but that would be very damaging?

05:10.818 --> 05:12.440
In general or to the individual?

05:12.780 --> 05:31.023
And a bit unfair since it may turn out that the individual has been treated badly by others, and that's the only reason for this current unpopularity.

05:32.705 --> 05:33.767
It would make no difference.

05:34.408 --> 05:35.950
People just plow ahead.

05:36.550 --> 05:40.335
And I think when it was more personal,

05:40.687 --> 05:46.093
when they knew each other, oh, I think they could really take each other's heads off, there's no question.

05:46.534 --> 05:48.896
There would be good, hard battles.

05:50.057 --> 06:08.398
But because I think they were going to look at each other again thereafter, and because they weren't goaded on by this high finance consultant habit, there were limits.

06:09.965 --> 06:11.267
It was just as hard fought.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.810
But there were real limits, I think, on people.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.192
Self-imposed limits.

06:16.874 --> 06:25.986
And some of the things that... Well, I saw a good politician in Massachusetts only a year or two ago running.

06:27.267 --> 06:29.730
And his opponent had no money.

06:31.533 --> 06:32.614
He had lots of money.

06:33.708 --> 06:37.657
And his consultant said, here, let us ridicule this fellow to death.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.100
The guy without money.

06:39.682 --> 06:39.842
Yeah.

06:39.862 --> 06:45.996
Ridicule the fellow without the money.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.002
And there was much fun in it.

06:48.362 --> 06:54.212
I must say that it was clever, and it must have been so debilitating to the individual.

06:54.252 --> 06:57.197
I'm sure at some point he must have said, why did I ever run?

06:57.998 --> 07:00.782
I'm going to be so badly damaged by this run.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.347
Was this a statewide contest?

07:04.508 --> 07:05.470
Yeah.

07:06.631 --> 07:15.662
And, I mean, so this, have you noticed this kind of thing just coming on more recently with the influence of the polls and the consultants and all that stuff?

07:15.722 --> 07:17.003
There are so many people into it.

07:17.063 --> 07:18.325
It's such a business now.

07:19.947 --> 07:22.189
Yeah, but everybody pays so much attention to these things.

07:23.010 --> 07:35.625
Well, people, you know, everyone gives lip service to the notion that negative campaigning is bad, but as I understand it, it's also effective.

07:36.787 --> 07:38.770
that the victim is diminished.

07:40.813 --> 07:41.714
Or even destroyed.

07:42.015 --> 07:44.959
Or destroyed, which seems to be the goal.

07:45.620 --> 08:01.343
And I have to say, it depresses me, being as one who's been a journalist for many, many years, to see this PAC mentality of people who it's almost reflexive to go after stories.

08:01.863 --> 08:05.989
Without any thought of what the hell it's all about, Joe.

08:06.009 --> 08:06.169
Yeah.

08:06.469 --> 08:09.534
I think that's another part of it, though, Nick.

08:09.554 --> 08:11.857
I'm talking right now about what we do to each other.

08:12.297 --> 08:13.619
Uh-huh.

08:13.639 --> 08:14.100
Exactly.

08:14.120 --> 08:19.467
And, you know, I think what you're saying definitely should be a matter of concern.

08:19.487 --> 08:26.577
I mean, you actually point out what you call a criminal class of journalists later on in the book.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.900
Yeah, well, there is such a thing.

08:29.302 --> 08:40.159
people who really will go on a campaign of vilification to destroy a person just by a constantly repeated lie that they will know is not true.

08:41.321 --> 08:45.568
And I think they're, of course, a minority.

08:46.710 --> 08:53.781
And there was a time in this country when you had to check on such people, the libel law, and it's gone.

08:54.582 --> 08:56.946
And so that

08:57.331 --> 09:07.807
These people almost drive the competition among the journalists and the electronic people.

09:09.610 --> 09:13.616
And they really should be brought up short every now and then.

09:15.099 --> 09:22.210
Thomas Jefferson, who really believed in free speech, loved the law of libel.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.515
He said, this is better than having any check by government.

09:25.968 --> 09:29.372
Let whoever has the inclination to do so, you know, step forward.

09:29.753 --> 09:31.895
He said this in his second inaugural.

09:33.137 --> 09:36.541
And he, step forward and take him to task.

09:36.601 --> 09:38.964
And it should only be a law of libel.

09:38.984 --> 09:42.588
It's a limited, only when there's real defamation.

09:42.708 --> 09:54.743
If you call someone fat, or stupid, or lazy, or whatever, or short, me, then that's not defamatory.

09:55.550 --> 10:15.774
There's a piece in the New York Times this morning about a care libel case that was thrown out against John McPhee, and I guess it was, he did a piece where he quoted somebody else saying that this guy had participated in some murders, I mean, and the guy lives in the United States, and he sued for libel, and he lost, you know.

10:16.615 --> 10:16.715
Sure.

10:16.735 --> 10:19.158
He said because they were accurately quoting other people.

10:19.898 --> 10:20.359
Yeah.

10:21.352 --> 10:26.219
All you have to do is find someone to say it.

10:26.239 --> 10:37.616
If a person does it, oh, and deliberately, and there are columnists, sad to say, who do it, and there is a market for it, then there should be a concern of people.

10:37.696 --> 10:48.912
There was a time when, around the turn of the century, when the courts would actually say, if you allow people to say just anything,

10:49.634 --> 10:53.540
then no one is going to step forward to run for public office.

10:53.560 --> 10:58.907
I could show you the cases, but they're there, and the judge has expressed concern about that.

10:59.989 --> 11:05.517
There should be an ability to sue and libel.

11:06.538 --> 11:07.660
By the way, it should not be...

11:09.766 --> 11:12.890
You know, it has to be false and it has to be defamatory.

11:13.010 --> 11:16.834
And generally malice seems to be a criterion as well, I think.

11:17.195 --> 11:20.338
But malice, as they use it, I don't want to get too technical about this.

11:21.019 --> 11:21.940
We're just chatting here.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.924
I don't see this getting into my piece, but I am interested in your thoughts.

11:24.944 --> 11:25.344
But go ahead.

11:25.424 --> 11:36.938
The malice thing is the thing which has wiped out the law of libel because the court in the Sullivan case in 1964, Justice Brennan said that...

11:37.593 --> 11:39.255
You have to show malice.

11:39.935 --> 11:42.177
And malice is not just meanness and hatred.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.820
It has a whole new definition.

11:45.100 --> 11:48.003
It's also knowledge that what you're reporting is incorrect.

11:48.083 --> 11:48.884
That's it.

11:48.904 --> 11:51.787
And there is the knowledge that it's incorrect.

11:51.847 --> 11:53.729
Are you pretty sure it's incorrect?

11:53.749 --> 11:55.010
And you go ahead with it anyway.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.752
You go ahead with it anyway.

11:56.772 --> 12:00.415
But the guy against whom you've used it has to now show your state of mind.

12:00.435 --> 12:01.156
That's right.

12:01.176 --> 12:04.219
And show that you proceeded with reckless disregard, as they say.

12:04.579 --> 12:05.560
Go ahead.

12:05.580 --> 12:05.981
I'm sorry.

12:06.001 --> 12:07.262
And herein lies the...

12:08.339 --> 12:13.410
the end of the law of libel for a public person.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.761
Of course, the definition of what makes a person public enters.

12:19.002 --> 12:21.066
And that's been broadened beyond

12:21.417 --> 12:23.179
I mean, you have to be a Trappist monk.

12:23.199 --> 12:30.927
Yeah, well, if you're involved in a lawsuit, for instance, or if you've been involved in, you know, any kind of charity work or something like that.

12:31.107 --> 12:34.430
If you write letters to the editor, you become a public person.

12:35.131 --> 12:37.333
So a public person is almost everyone.

12:38.394 --> 12:47.083
And the bad thing is that legitimate journalists bridle at the notion that a law of libel would be a threat to them.

12:47.103 --> 12:47.944
It really would not.

12:48.725 --> 12:51.087
It would really be just to those who...

12:51.826 --> 12:53.869
It's something like the law.

12:53.889 --> 12:55.291
You have a law against murder.

12:55.351 --> 12:58.636
There are very few of us that would be inclined to murder someone.

12:59.257 --> 13:01.200
You have to have it for those who just might.

13:02.342 --> 13:04.445
And it's only a small class.

13:05.286 --> 13:07.129
And am I on the tape now?

13:07.309 --> 13:07.510
Yep.

13:07.790 --> 13:08.351
Okay.

13:08.551 --> 13:10.274
If you want me to go off, just tell me.

13:10.334 --> 13:12.477
Let me just go off it for a second.

13:12.577 --> 13:16.483
They're taping again.

13:16.902 --> 13:24.731
First of all, let's talk in general about your view of what a memoir is as opposed to an autobiography.

13:24.771 --> 13:30.097
I think a memoir is a little easier.

13:31.238 --> 13:32.780
Because it can be very selective, of course.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.961
It can be very selective.

13:34.302 --> 13:41.610
You're not trying to give a day-by-day story of a life.

13:43.463 --> 13:47.248
It allows you to lean more on memory.

13:47.288 --> 13:48.590
Well, that was my sense of it.

13:49.551 --> 13:54.037
That's how I felt about it at the time, as best I can recollect.

13:55.699 --> 13:59.984
And some say, well, there's a sharpness.

14:00.044 --> 14:02.488
There's a bite to what you've said about.

14:03.269 --> 14:05.752
I've heard that, and I think that's true.

14:06.332 --> 14:10.618
I don't think it's anything, however, that has not been said.

14:11.408 --> 14:16.815
Most of the disputes I speak of in the book are kind of a public thing.

14:17.857 --> 14:26.248
And I don't think that, and I commend you also, it's my sense, maybe others will feel differently, but I don't think that you're using this as an opportunity to settle scores.

14:27.410 --> 14:39.306
No, no, you know, I really felt as though I, you know, this obligation to truth required me to, you know, state it as,

14:41.159 --> 14:52.856
as honestly as humanly possible, and that does involve your very subjective kind of recollection of things.

14:54.098 --> 14:57.083
I can't think of an example, but here's a quick one.

14:57.443 --> 15:00.147
Bob Crane is an old friend.

15:00.751 --> 15:05.679
Somewhere in the book, Bob Crane is saying to me, why won't you tell me you think I'm a leek?

15:06.300 --> 15:10.126
I said, dear God, I think you're not a leek, you're Niagara Falls.

15:10.807 --> 15:12.229
Because Bob couldn't help himself.

15:12.249 --> 15:13.070
He would tell everything.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.252
No malice in Bob.

15:14.773 --> 15:16.696
Total just irresponsibility.

15:17.878 --> 15:28.935
And so that, by one of my political critics, turned out to be that I had characterized Crane in the book as...

15:29.776 --> 15:31.319
Unreliable is the word.

15:32.121 --> 15:33.664
I don't think that's the word you use, is it?

15:34.206 --> 15:34.687
Not at all.

15:35.027 --> 15:40.800
And I think that the fact that I'm saying it, my suggestion is that you can only understand it in its context.

15:40.820 --> 15:41.261
That's right.

15:41.401 --> 15:43.024
And I'm saying it to Crane.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.207
And when Crane read it,

15:44.812 --> 15:45.893
He himself liked it.

15:45.993 --> 15:46.834
He thought it was good.

15:46.854 --> 15:47.575
He said, I am.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.676
I'm away.

15:48.696 --> 15:50.658
I can help myself.

15:51.579 --> 15:59.789
But, I mean, there certainly could be opportunities to, I mean, without doubt, I mean, a politician, it's endemic to the species.

15:59.869 --> 16:02.532
I mean, there are enemies that are created along the way.

16:02.592 --> 16:08.338
I mean, you acknowledge that and, you know, the opportunity to have a

16:08.977 --> 16:14.702
a book appear between hardcovers, you know, is a sense of permanence.

16:15.343 --> 16:27.153
And it does give an opportunity for, if not the last word, but a word that will endure a lot longer than something said on a radio call-in program, to be sure.

16:28.174 --> 16:31.917
And yet you did kind of hold back here a bit.

16:32.718 --> 16:37.262
There are some people, almost in every case I try to put in

16:37.242 --> 16:39.564
the fact that the person had his own virtues.

16:40.485 --> 16:49.335
I did give the business to Raymond Flynn in some way, but I did say he was, this is not my word, but I like the word, indefatigable.

16:51.337 --> 16:53.639
Worker, you know, he just kept at it all the time.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.102
He had many such qualities.

16:58.144 --> 17:00.887
I'm sorry, go ahead.

17:01.188 --> 17:15.670
But your original question, you know who talked about the difference between a monobiography and a memoir not long ago was Gore Vidal in the book review in the Times on Sunday.

17:16.004 --> 17:40.155
recently spoke of the difference oh yeah oh i've it's it's a matter of continuing interest to me and i and i it's not it's not the first time i've asked the question i just i like to hear what the what the writer has to say about it and i have to say that you dictated this some of it i dictated some of it i wrote out longhand yeah no it's very very nicely written there are some

17:40.135 --> 17:42.637
You know, I take it from one who reads books professionally.

17:42.657 --> 17:43.618
This is my business.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.722
You have a nice facility with the written word here.

17:48.102 --> 17:48.903
Congratulations.

17:48.943 --> 17:52.566
And I kept looking for who the consultant was.

17:52.626 --> 17:54.308
And you say at the back, there isn't any.

17:54.348 --> 17:55.129
This is my own.

17:56.230 --> 17:59.272
And for better or for worse, you know, I admire that.

18:00.073 --> 18:07.560
I really want to see the real thing as opposed to some highly paid ghostwriter, you know, in the suburbs.

18:07.540 --> 18:10.668
Actually, I began to enjoy it.

18:10.688 --> 18:14.097
And I did have a sense that I was having my say.

18:14.578 --> 18:20.855
Again, one of my critics in the Globe said, Paul just seeks to have the last word.

18:21.617 --> 18:22.579
Well, for heaven's sake...

18:22.947 --> 18:25.331
I know the press has the last word.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.035
I'm just trying to have a word.

18:28.455 --> 18:29.497
Have they reviewed it already?

18:29.998 --> 18:30.719
No, they have not.

18:31.340 --> 18:34.304
Some of the sportswriters have strafed and bombed it.

18:34.384 --> 18:35.746
Not sportswriters, but I'm sorry.

18:35.766 --> 18:39.172
I was going to say the sportswriters have covered it.

18:40.013 --> 18:48.786
No, you say early on, and of course, and I'm not going to make any deal out of it, but you do get into your brother, and you do give three pages to it, and...

18:49.255 --> 18:58.365
But you do say that many of the attacks are, you believe, attacks against you, are meant to be attacks against you.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.086
Yeah, I think sometimes that was the case.

19:00.126 --> 19:16.123
I think that, well, way back in 1990, I was seeking re-election, but I was also associated with the campaign of John Silber.

19:17.521 --> 19:22.526
And I think some of the attacks on him were aimed at me.

19:22.546 --> 19:38.040
In fact, it crept into the campaign so that some of the statewide offices... Keep in mind, I was about the last Democrat still standing, so it was a very juicy target.

19:38.540 --> 19:43.064
Everyone was leaving Dukakis, Evelyn Murphy, even Crane, Kavarian.

19:44.186 --> 19:45.807
And so it was sort of the most...

19:46.512 --> 19:53.941
prominent, statewide, democratic, individual in the mix.

19:53.961 --> 19:57.646
And so I became an easy target.

19:57.706 --> 20:04.534
And oftentimes, I think some very false things about my brother were uttered.

20:06.036 --> 20:08.980
And then I would be mentioned.

20:10.201 --> 20:11.783
No nexus.

20:11.803 --> 20:12.604
The sort of

20:12.837 --> 20:42.405
mentioned well but the brother of the context would be the brother of and even Bill Weld with whom I got along very well during my five years he called me for me at one point to step down and he didn't give any real reason for it I told him then I'll step down I said when you're here I'm going to step down on you I admire your you know your loyalty I mean you say this is my brother and and and

20:42.740 --> 20:46.804
He's lived his life and I've lived mine, but he's my brother and I love him, I guess.

20:46.964 --> 20:47.765
What more can you say?

20:49.007 --> 21:00.418
And, of course, it's a credit to your constituency, isn't it, that whatever problems he may have had, they haven't held it against you, have they?

21:00.719 --> 21:02.260
It's an amazing thing there.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.823
I never hear from them.

21:04.843 --> 21:06.765
They don't say anything about it to me.

21:07.666 --> 21:08.887
They might say, how is he doing?

21:10.949 --> 21:11.650
They know him.

21:13.132 --> 21:15.715
Most of them know him as Jimmy to the outside world.

21:15.735 --> 21:16.616
He has a nickname.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.540
The press carries the nickname always.

21:20.660 --> 21:24.724
But the people I know who know him use a different name.

21:26.126 --> 21:31.071
And if anything, they'll just say hello to Jim or something.

21:31.091 --> 21:41.282
And then each time a new kind of reporter would come along, I can remember there was one, Jack Cole.

21:41.903 --> 21:47.351
He'd never let me near an interview or anything, if he is, that he wouldn't want to get into that.

21:47.391 --> 21:48.653
I'd just say I'm not discussing.

21:48.733 --> 21:52.078
But what would there be to say in any case?

21:52.098 --> 21:58.849
There wasn't much to say, but he just thought that was a juicy... Good soundbite, I guess.

21:58.869 --> 21:59.069
Exactly.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.691
So as I sort of said, no, I'm not discussing.

22:00.711 --> 22:02.234
Didn't he run for public office?

22:02.254 --> 22:03.315
He did, yeah.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.477
And he got trounced, right?

22:04.497 --> 22:06.620
And so did Chris Leighton run for public office.

22:07.221 --> 22:11.067
Journalists actually believe that they're doers.

22:11.047 --> 22:11.908
Here I go.

22:11.948 --> 22:14.953
You're lumping them all together.

22:15.273 --> 22:18.738
Are there any Bulger's rules of politics?

22:19.519 --> 22:20.921
I mean... Bulger's rules?

22:21.682 --> 22:21.883
Yeah.

22:22.003 --> 22:35.142
No, I think a couple of things I would say to people is... I think I'd say somehow or other make up your own mind and think for yourself.

22:35.523 --> 22:39.248
And if you come to a strong conclusion...

22:40.527 --> 22:46.475
on a particular matter of importance, don't be afraid to stay with it.

22:47.917 --> 22:49.679
You might provide leadership for others.

22:50.100 --> 23:06.362
People, I really believe in the maxim of Edmund Burke, you know, the famous one where he says, your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgment.

23:06.382 --> 23:08.965
And he betrays instead of serving you.

23:09.991 --> 23:13.674
when he sacrifices it to your opinion.

23:15.196 --> 23:15.596
It's wonderful.

23:15.616 --> 23:19.640
And I have that by heart only because I say it to new legislators.

23:19.720 --> 23:28.649
I say, sir, if you have a strong conviction, don't just remain unshakable and let somebody appeal to reason to dissuade you.

23:28.669 --> 23:33.193
And you'll find that people really, really respect that.

23:34.294 --> 23:39.559
I probably, at some levels, and I'm a Democrat, so...

23:40.332 --> 23:50.745
Allow me to just say this, that some of my favorites are suffering these days, I think, by virtue of the fact that they're viewed as weather vanes.

23:50.765 --> 23:51.627
Democrats, you mean?

23:51.647 --> 23:52.267
Yeah.

23:53.789 --> 24:00.678
The notion that whatever the heck, the prevailing wind is in that direction.

24:01.820 --> 24:05.985
And I've always found that my own constituents, even in disagreement...

24:06.877 --> 24:22.017
You know, I really don't sense defiance in this book, but there is one lovely quote towards the back where you mention particularly this criminal element, which you describe as a discrete criminal class of reporter.

24:21.997 --> 24:26.887
And for everything that's been thrown at you, you say, I am still here.

24:27.568 --> 24:27.989
Yeah, yeah.

24:28.209 --> 24:29.813
I love that line.

24:31.797 --> 24:34.001
Is politics a contact sport?

24:34.061 --> 24:37.187
Maybe we could talk specifically about Massachusetts politics.

24:37.308 --> 24:39.051
And also I want to get into it.

24:39.071 --> 24:41.035
By the way, tell me when we're running...

24:41.015 --> 24:42.597
when you have to run.

24:42.737 --> 24:43.839
Oh, I'm trying.

24:44.840 --> 24:45.361
Okay, good.

24:45.381 --> 25:05.549
You mentioned, of course, the South, and I'm not asking you things that are in the book because my job is to read it and to pull it out of there and stuff that I've already read, but you do say at one point that South Boston has been maligned nationally by headlines and stuff, and I wonder if you could just expand a little bit on that.

25:06.570 --> 25:10.836
The busing edict was a gross...

25:14.292 --> 25:42.342
era and it inflicted injustice upon the people of that community and then the injustice was compounded when on each occasion when they protested they were smeared nationally and internationally as bigots for doing so now

25:43.908 --> 25:47.934
I had Dr. James Coleman one time as a guest of mine.

25:49.577 --> 25:58.811
He says, you know, the sociologist who died only recently, but who had been sort of the father of this busing thing.

25:58.951 --> 26:02.577
By this time, he had sort of recanted, but it was too late.

26:02.657 --> 26:03.959
It now had a life of its own.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.341
No one was going to end it.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.808
And he said to me what I think is true.

26:10.148 --> 26:11.350
He said, your people,

26:11.887 --> 26:14.571
are the innocent third party.

26:17.435 --> 26:22.642
You have the aggrieved black parent who's saying, for heaven's sake, don't assign me on the basis of skin color.

26:24.024 --> 26:29.912
And you have the wrongdoing officialdom, whatever it might be, the bureaucracy or the school committee or whoever.

26:32.216 --> 26:35.741
And then they have swept into this innocent third party.

26:35.781 --> 26:36.942
They've done nothing wrong.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.726
No one even accuses them of having done anything wrong.

26:41.348 --> 26:41.809
And yet,

26:42.312 --> 26:56.567
They're called upon by a federal judge to pay the penalty to have their children shipped about on the basis of skin color, the very thing that we decried elsewhere in the country only a short time before.

26:57.528 --> 27:08.539
And they're also going to see these institutions, local institutions, schools, dismantled, closed, many of them.

27:09.852 --> 27:14.038
And no community can survive without these various local institutions.

27:14.078 --> 27:16.101
They were part and parcel of the place.

27:18.043 --> 27:22.810
The thing that should have been done, of course, was to just make sure the black children could go wherever they wanted to go.

27:22.830 --> 27:27.176
And then respect the same wish on the part of the white parent.

27:27.196 --> 27:33.084
And in that way, you'd have people, they would not be confronting each other and battling it out.

27:34.026 --> 27:36.529
But the unaffected proponents didn't see it that way.

27:37.190 --> 27:38.712
They just saw these people...

27:39.485 --> 27:41.247
in the city as bad people.

27:41.307 --> 27:49.755
Michael Novak says that these are the urban Catholic ethnics who are badly maligned.

27:50.315 --> 28:03.187
But he said, consider, there is no racially mixed city unless they're remaining because they have this kind of a community rootedness, do you know?

28:04.308 --> 28:09.373
And he admired that, Novak, and he thought that that was very important.

28:09.860 --> 28:17.676
Yet I think by, on the part of many, many others, it was not appreciated.

28:17.877 --> 28:19.661
We've become so sophisticated.

28:19.721 --> 28:22.667
We could never think of having a home or town.

28:23.729 --> 28:25.974
Well, but it is a perception that people have.

28:26.014 --> 28:27.497
There was a book that was published...

28:28.000 --> 28:34.876
Oh, two or three years ago, and I wrote a scathing review of it, and it was about the Boston Celtics by two New York Times reporters.

28:35.698 --> 28:39.506
And in there, they quote, without checking their facts, Spike Lee.

28:40.048 --> 28:45.621
And he says, whenever I think of Boston, he says, all I see are those school buses with the kids being tipped over.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.262
Oh, my goodness.

28:46.242 --> 28:48.305
And, you know, rocked and tipped over.

28:48.325 --> 28:51.269
And I said to myself, that never happened.

28:51.289 --> 28:52.831
What the heck is he talking about there?

28:53.492 --> 28:58.159
And these reporters printed that without checking their facts.

28:58.559 --> 29:00.022
And it never did happen, you know.

29:00.422 --> 29:02.024
But yet that's the perception.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.868
And they quoted it.

29:04.888 --> 29:05.790
They said, well, he said it.

29:05.870 --> 29:06.751
Again, it's he said it.

29:06.811 --> 29:10.997
But, you know, the normal reporter would go check your facts and see if such a thing ever happened.

29:11.177 --> 29:13.441
But there never was any kind of an incident like that.

29:13.481 --> 29:15.203
And yet it's put out on a national basis.

29:15.183 --> 29:16.605
publication like that.

29:17.165 --> 29:32.182
I mean, you know, before that, school buses with black children were coming into every school in the community, with the exception of South Boston High, which was so crowded with the locals that they actually had an annex down at the L Street bathhouse.

29:34.645 --> 29:42.253
So the problem came from the judge being so high-handed and from his

29:43.027 --> 29:48.853
distant comfort in Wellesley, where I understand he was quite lionized for his heroism.

29:50.094 --> 29:51.616
He said, no, we'll do this.

29:52.196 --> 29:58.303
We'll uproot several hundred here, several hundred there, and we'll ship them around.

30:00.005 --> 30:07.212
Tom Sowell, you know, the black economist, I think he is, writer, he said that

30:09.284 --> 30:19.595
Those who move other people's children around like pieces on a chessboard demonstrate their profound contempt for those people.

30:20.957 --> 30:26.062
So I, who identify with these folks who are being moved around, I can tell you, you felt their contempt.

30:27.004 --> 30:27.664
You felt it.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.747
You wouldn't sit still for this.

30:31.368 --> 30:32.129
There's not one.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.851
I used to challenge each one.

30:34.031 --> 30:35.193
I think I say all of this.

30:35.313 --> 30:39.257
I say, what you must do is...

30:40.098 --> 30:53.256
tell your congregation to put their children at the disposal of the judge.

30:53.276 --> 30:54.858
I said, you should have to do things at home.

30:55.719 --> 30:57.021
It's not what you tell us to do.

30:58.082 --> 30:59.364
It's what you do yourself.

30:59.384 --> 31:03.149
And if you have children yourself, for heaven's sake, put them at the disposal of the judge.

31:03.470 --> 31:04.531
And there were no takers.

31:05.673 --> 31:06.794
The hypocrisy of it.

31:07.275 --> 31:09.598
And the cynicism of it all was that

31:09.865 --> 31:11.307
You could do this to poor people.

31:11.447 --> 31:19.260
You could never do it in the affluence of Wellesley or Lincoln because those people have checkbooks.

31:19.280 --> 31:25.389
They would not sit still for having their children and their education being disturbed in this way.

31:25.810 --> 31:28.875
And most of them were probably sending their kids to private schools in any case.

31:28.895 --> 31:29.255
Oh, sure.

31:29.275 --> 31:32.160
I never met a...
