WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:23.124
Okay, 17 February 2000, Nick Bazbanes at home in Grafton with Neil Griffin from London.

00:23.144 --> 00:27.327
Is that a tape or is that a mini disc?

00:27.347 --> 00:28.549
It's a nice kind of thing.

00:28.569 --> 00:32.552
Okay, we're up and running now.

00:32.735 --> 00:47.778
I would suggest the best thing to do would be for me to start because that will be shorter.

00:47.898 --> 00:58.354
So, if I talk a little bit about my meeting with Jim Casper,

00:58.688 --> 01:04.453
You can cross the ground with me on that, and, you know, for additional information on that.

01:04.473 --> 01:04.653
Okay.

01:04.753 --> 01:10.459
But for the purposes of my tape, I know who Hedman O'Moore is, but perhaps you could explain who Jim Casper is.

01:10.479 --> 01:17.345
Yeah, Jim Casper is a man now in his, I would estimate, early 40s.

01:18.506 --> 01:20.988
He lived in Newton, in Massachusetts.

01:21.008 --> 01:26.653
He was a student at Brandeis University, contemporaneous, with David Waxman.

01:27.342 --> 01:56.640
and michael davis who was a student of haven o'more's um courses which were conducted off campus for reasons we'll get into later and also sold um products from the shackley pyramid selling so he was which was which was happening um contemporaneously in fact um was an intrinsic part of the course and remind me later on

01:57.127 --> 02:01.794
about Shagli because I do have some documentation on it.

02:01.974 --> 02:02.615
Okay.

02:03.897 --> 02:06.420
He was a filmmaker.

02:07.341 --> 02:12.389
Yeah, and I don't know more, used him to make a film called Hatha Yoga Dashana.

02:12.409 --> 02:13.771
Which we will be watching presently.

02:13.831 --> 02:14.231
We will.

02:14.712 --> 02:23.044
And it's a 35 minute one man show featuring pretty much yoga and only yoga.

02:23.284 --> 02:24.045
He was also

02:24.937 --> 02:33.145
sent up to North Dakota and Montana to make a movie for Haven No More.

02:33.165 --> 02:33.586
Oh, that's new.

02:33.606 --> 02:54.387
Yeah, to make a movie for Haven No More about, well, it was essentially about man and his relationship with Earth, but the environment in which it was being made was a union dispute, a labor dispute, and an environmental dispute with coal mining, coal and oil mining companies.

02:54.738 --> 02:59.184
who were strip-mining the area under conditions of great secrecy.

02:59.204 --> 03:03.930
And Jim Casper was sent off by Haven and was making a documentary about this.

03:05.232 --> 03:07.054
I think... We don't have to go off on this.

03:07.094 --> 03:20.972
No, but I think Haven's involvement in this was that he saw an opportunity to use this subject matter as a way of making a film about the ideal relationship between man and earth.

03:21.313 --> 03:24.677
The movie did actually get made under...

03:25.383 --> 03:51.002
very extreme conditions jim casper tells me and with very little money and he was actually infuriated later when he realized that michael davis was a multi-millionaire he had no inkling every time they were both at brandeis and that i even know more had access to this money let me get this straight uh he met davis at brandeis um casper knew of davis's existence but brett davis whether you know it or not went to harvard

03:51.421 --> 03:53.324
Yeah, he was, but he came on.

03:53.344 --> 03:53.845
He dropped out.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.307
Yeah, he came on subsequently.

03:55.327 --> 03:57.630
He met him, not at Randus, but at the courses for him.

03:57.650 --> 04:00.755
At the courses for Shackley.

04:00.835 --> 04:03.559
Michael met Haven, I can tell you.

04:03.579 --> 04:13.214
And I get this from my attorney, who got it from Haven's attorney, because this was where we were going, about this relationship.

04:13.234 --> 04:15.798
And he said, well, they met, Michael met Haven.

04:18.001 --> 04:18.822
It's good.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.685
Michael met Haven at a Shackley meeting.

04:21.998 --> 04:24.382
while he was a student at Harvard.

04:24.402 --> 04:26.225
And for me, that's like punching me in the nose.

04:26.326 --> 04:32.797
It's like saying, I've looked everywhere to find all these people, these people I talked to in New York.

04:33.839 --> 04:38.126
The young woman, remind me, I'll get you her name, Dawn Weldon, I believe.

04:38.146 --> 04:38.647
Dawn Weldon.

04:38.667 --> 04:39.609
She's in London.

04:39.629 --> 04:40.250
She's in London.

04:40.330 --> 04:43.616
She worked at her, I mean, Priscilla, Priscilla must have told you about her.

04:44.277 --> 04:45.359
Steve Massey knows her.

04:45.739 --> 04:46.200
They all know her.

04:46.585 --> 04:54.576
There's a photograph of her and an article about John Fleming where she's walking in the back with a, I may have it sometimes.

04:54.596 --> 04:54.816
Oh, really?

04:54.836 --> 04:55.838
It's kind of cool.

04:56.018 --> 04:58.041
Nice looking young man.

04:58.101 --> 05:01.325
But in any case, I asked Florence.

05:01.345 --> 05:02.487
She said, well, he disappeared.

05:02.527 --> 05:03.588
He was a party animal.

05:03.628 --> 05:04.730
He was fat.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.292
We called him Falstaff.

05:06.332 --> 05:07.193
That was his nickname.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.316
And he disappeared.

05:09.536 --> 05:10.558
He went away to school.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.799
I said, where did he go to school?

05:12.120 --> 05:13.141
She didn't know.

05:13.241 --> 05:15.124
I mean, had she said everything?

05:16.640 --> 05:17.741
It would have been so easy.

05:17.861 --> 05:24.530
Why, you know, why it never occurred to me that this kid was at Harvard?

05:24.550 --> 05:27.513
You know, it really does answer a lot of questions, by the way.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.356
I mean, a lot of things now fit.

05:30.637 --> 05:41.310
I mean, I don't have... I still haven't seen, and I'll show you the documents later, you know, that are the impounded files in Middlesex Superior Court.

05:42.732 --> 05:46.056
But as horrific as the contents may be, they don't really...

05:46.846 --> 05:52.253
They don't really drive me, motivate, energize me as they might because I think I know now what happened.

05:52.633 --> 06:01.905
And my interest really for this book was to try and understand the dynamic that went into the formulation of this book collection.

06:01.925 --> 06:04.028
And I'm sorry to be going off the track.

06:04.048 --> 06:04.328
No, no, no.

06:04.348 --> 06:04.889
But this is good.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.671
Whatever order, we'll get it.

06:06.691 --> 06:07.152
Yeah, yeah.

06:07.372 --> 06:09.535
So anyway, go ahead.

06:10.216 --> 06:11.457
So I understand who Casper is.

06:11.598 --> 06:13.340
Yeah.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.823
His company was called Inquiry Productions.

06:16.613 --> 06:24.561
And he made an analysis of himself with the various coal companies up there in North Dakota.

06:24.962 --> 06:25.823
Is this one copy?

06:25.963 --> 06:27.104
Yeah, I thought we could do another one.

06:27.164 --> 06:28.225
Hey, Nicky, Nicole?

06:29.827 --> 06:30.428
Come here, sweetie.

06:32.790 --> 06:33.231
Yes, dear.

06:35.513 --> 06:37.115
Would you make two copies of this, please?

06:37.816 --> 06:39.057
One for you and one for me?

06:39.257 --> 06:39.778
Another one.

06:39.838 --> 06:40.539
Okay.

06:40.579 --> 06:42.661
Two copies of yours.

06:42.681 --> 06:43.802
Two of each.

06:44.761 --> 06:48.125
So we're going to give him a file clip.

06:49.567 --> 06:50.769
So the movie got made.

06:51.710 --> 06:55.174
It came back and he was putting it together.

06:55.195 --> 06:55.976
He was editing it.

06:56.296 --> 06:57.437
And it was a working copy.

06:57.457 --> 06:59.060
He brought Michael Davis in to see it.

07:00.161 --> 07:02.945
And Davis loved it.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.086
Because Davis

07:04.640 --> 07:09.808
Asper tells me was more, was familiar with post-production processes of film.

07:10.168 --> 07:15.256
He knew that the scratches and the remarks on it were simply, you know, a work in progress.

07:16.137 --> 07:19.321
And they were probably, you know, a few thousand dollars off finishing it.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.964
They needed that money.

07:20.984 --> 07:24.950
Um, Davis called Haven O'Moore and said, come over and see Phil.

07:24.970 --> 07:28.795
We've got a, you know, we've got a rough class and we can show you.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.980
And O'Moore, Casper is convinced, hated it because

07:32.585 --> 07:35.608
He thought that's how it would look when it was finished.

07:35.628 --> 07:40.833
And as a result, he washed his hands a bit, refused to advance any money for his completion.

07:40.853 --> 07:42.214
I'm not following it.

07:42.294 --> 07:43.436
Why did he hate it?

07:43.936 --> 07:47.540
He saw a copy that was a working copy.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.360
It was scratched.

07:48.380 --> 07:52.244
He didn't understand that?

07:53.165 --> 08:02.254
No matter what Casper said to him, he couldn't get it into his head that with the extra money, once the film had been finished properly and blocked off and everything,

08:02.420 --> 08:04.282
you know, the film would look the way a film should.

08:04.523 --> 08:08.327
Maybe it didn't glorify him in ways of the right of life.

08:08.347 --> 08:12.372
O' Moore didn't say that, and Casper didn't either, but the implication was there.

08:12.412 --> 08:21.824
It's possible that the movie he returned from North Dakota that O' Moore had envisaged.

08:21.844 --> 08:24.647
And the result was that O' Moore washed his hands a bit.

08:24.687 --> 08:28.492
No further money was forthcoming to complete the movie.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.474
And this was 1974, right?

08:30.494 --> 08:31.836
Yeah, O' Moore took the print.

08:32.035 --> 08:34.217
Very interesting time period.

08:34.257 --> 08:36.820
Caspar hasn't seen it since.

08:36.840 --> 08:37.981
He hasn't seen it since.

08:38.001 --> 08:41.985
So, but I don't think this is a matter of some... Nope, this is just... It's peripheral.

08:42.005 --> 08:43.246
It's peripheral, I think, yeah.

08:43.486 --> 08:46.209
Spearing everything.

08:46.229 --> 08:50.013
At Brandeis, David Waxman was Caspar's roommate.

08:50.033 --> 08:51.074
They had a big falling out.

08:51.134 --> 08:53.877
They hadn't seen each other for, well, since then.

08:54.457 --> 09:00.203
The falling out was over what Caspar saw as Waxman's slavish devotion to her mother.

09:00.908 --> 09:05.654
Have you seen the pan that Waxman wrote to Hayman?

09:05.714 --> 09:07.015
No, I've only seen extracts of it.

09:07.195 --> 09:08.938
No, I have a full copy that you can have.

09:08.958 --> 09:09.178
Great.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.721
I spoke to Waxman at the book fair.

09:11.741 --> 09:12.682
That's tough to get.

09:12.922 --> 09:13.943
He wasn't speaking to me.

09:13.963 --> 09:14.444
Yes, I know.

09:14.464 --> 09:15.265
He wasn't giving me a copy.

09:15.285 --> 09:16.607
Well, we have two copies here.

09:16.707 --> 09:19.150
I mean, there's Xeroxes, but that's all I have.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.351
That would be great.

09:20.691 --> 09:22.113
But you should really see this.

09:22.494 --> 09:26.158
I spoke to pretty much everyone at a book fair, with the exception of Waxman.

09:26.178 --> 09:30.443
Waxman was surprised to hear that I was going to meet her more.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.205
but still wanted to wait until O'Maw had met me.

09:33.245 --> 09:34.107
He's terrified of O'Maw.

09:34.167 --> 09:34.788
Yeah.

09:34.808 --> 09:42.239
Still wanted to wait until O'Maw had met me to, um, decide whether or not he wanted to do something.

09:42.339 --> 09:50.891
I mean, there's a fascinating little, there's a fascinating little story to Gentle Madness involving, uh, uh, David Laxman.

09:50.911 --> 09:59.704
Uh, those who own the, the uncorrected page, the, the, the galleys of my book, it's a pretty, a pretty interesting thing to own.

10:00.224 --> 10:05.029
I can certainly show it to you.

10:05.109 --> 10:13.158
But in the first draft, which Waxman got a copy of, I don't know, we don't really know how, but I know how.

10:13.218 --> 10:16.883
I'll see you through the original.

10:16.903 --> 10:17.303
Thank you very much.

10:17.323 --> 10:17.844
You're welcome.

10:17.884 --> 10:18.464
Thank you.

10:18.645 --> 10:18.785
Thanks.

10:18.945 --> 10:25.112
Okay, and then if you'd like to make a copy, you may have the answer.

10:25.132 --> 10:29.877
Waxman had confirmed to me that Haven O'Moore's name originally was Haven Moore.

10:30.397 --> 10:34.682
And that Haven O'Moore was a play on Have No More.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.105
And he did that on tape, and I wrote that into the book.

10:37.646 --> 10:42.491
When he got his hands on a copy of The Galleys, he went crazy.

10:42.611 --> 10:43.212
He went ballistic.

10:43.232 --> 10:45.395
He called my editor, he put in this, he put in that.

10:45.475 --> 10:46.616
I was quoted out of context.

10:46.816 --> 10:47.657
I never said this.

10:47.677 --> 10:48.298
This is impossible.

10:49.239 --> 10:50.961
I'm going to sue.

10:50.981 --> 10:52.543
He would fuck his bad brains think he is.

10:52.623 --> 10:54.425
I mean, you know, he's a quote.

10:55.507 --> 10:57.589
I said, really now, really now, let's take it easy.

10:57.809 --> 11:00.032
And then I really, really,

11:00.788 --> 11:04.494
lacerated my editor's ass for letting copies of the proof get out, you know?

11:04.514 --> 11:07.118
I mean, I said, there's some fiery stuff in here.

11:07.158 --> 11:11.225
We really don't want the world getting your hands on it before we're in print.

11:11.786 --> 11:15.171
Anyway, he said, why don't you talk to Waxman and work this out?

11:15.792 --> 11:16.774
We're concerned here.

11:16.794 --> 11:17.716
I said, fine.

11:17.736 --> 11:19.739
I called Waxman on the phone.

11:19.779 --> 11:26.610
He said, well, Mr. Baxter, David, before you say a word, I said, before you say a word, I said, let me play something for you, okay?

11:27.637 --> 11:30.460
And so I played the tape recording of our telephone.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.562
And he said, did you tape this?

11:32.383 --> 11:33.344
I said, well, of course I did.

11:33.364 --> 11:34.465
And I did it with your permission.

11:35.727 --> 11:35.987
I did.

11:36.528 --> 11:36.848
OK?

11:37.068 --> 11:37.328
I did.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.694
He doesn't remember that, but I did.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.736
And I had work.

11:43.996 --> 11:53.247
I said, now that we understand that I'm not misquoting it, and that I have my facts straight, I said, what's the problem now?

11:54.088 --> 11:57.272
I said, it is so important for me not to have that go in your book.

11:58.012 --> 11:59.253
He didn't want to be the one.

12:00.114 --> 12:07.403
I said, well, you know what, my dad, David, I said, is that it?

12:07.423 --> 12:08.524
Is that the biggest problem here?

12:08.824 --> 12:10.806
He said, I'd like everything out of the book.

12:10.826 --> 12:11.707
I said, well, guess what?

12:11.747 --> 12:12.729
I said, that's not going to happen.

12:13.730 --> 12:16.272
I said, you knew you were talking to a writer when he spoke.

12:17.394 --> 12:19.977
I said, you knew you were being interviewed for a publication.

12:21.258 --> 12:27.445
And I said, I've got you on tape, and I will use material that is pertinent to the book.

12:28.302 --> 12:37.073
But, however, if this is something, I said, but having said that, now let's find out what the problem is and maybe we can lessen the blow.

12:37.193 --> 12:44.442
He said, what he really did not want is his confirming the Haven War thing.

12:44.462 --> 12:45.143
I said, is that it?

12:46.525 --> 12:46.945
He said, yeah.

12:46.965 --> 12:47.686
I said, fine, it's out.

12:48.107 --> 12:50.510
I'm taking it out.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.032
He said, you're going to do that?

12:52.292 --> 12:52.993
I said, yeah.

12:53.429 --> 12:54.470
I said, because, you know what?

12:54.550 --> 12:57.454
I said, David, trust me, it's not because I'm such a nice guy.

12:57.734 --> 13:01.318
I said, because I have confirmation from the federal government.

13:01.338 --> 13:02.700
I've got it in their document.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.505
An official communication in response to a freedom of information at query.

13:08.026 --> 13:16.755
I said, confirming on the strength of a social security number, which is authentic, which I passed on to them, and they'd say the name he used when he was in the U.S.

13:17.156 --> 13:18.157
Army was even more.

13:18.558 --> 13:21.120
I said, so I don't need David Wacken.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.542
But later...

13:23.686 --> 13:37.201
You see, I think that this was a, then when the stuff came from Haven, he was denying that this was him, that I must have the wrong guy, not knowing that I knew about the Kansas thing.

13:37.302 --> 13:52.579
If I don't have that deposition, Neil, I am, I mean, in my mind, this thing, I'll show you the letters that came in, that I had fabricated this, I was reckless, I was malicious, I was all of these things.

13:53.656 --> 14:01.043
And if you didn't have the wrong guy, if I had gone into the Army in 1944, I would have only been fifteen years old.

14:01.063 --> 14:10.652
Well, you'll see, you know, in this sworn deposition here, where he says, uh, he was fifteen years old.

14:10.672 --> 14:12.233
Did you see combat in the Second World War?

14:12.314 --> 14:12.854
A little bit.

14:12.874 --> 14:15.036
Yes, that's a lie, by the way.

14:15.096 --> 14:15.637
Where was that?

14:15.717 --> 14:16.758
In the European theater.

14:16.778 --> 14:17.799
Another lie.

14:17.819 --> 14:19.180
What did you do after you were destroyed?

14:19.200 --> 14:22.363
You came back, well, anyway, you see, this is all wrong.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.606
I wandered around here.

14:25.726 --> 14:29.911
When did you go, where did you go when you left home at age 13?

14:30.451 --> 14:37.198
I wandered around for a couple of years and worked at many things and tried to survive and did end, obviously, and then went into the Army.

14:37.718 --> 14:42.243
Would that have been, I'm just, this is a lawyer now, I'm just trying to do some eyeball mathematics.

14:42.263 --> 14:43.124
Would that have been in what?

14:43.725 --> 14:45.166
The early to mid-40s?

14:45.186 --> 14:48.249
When you left around here, it would have been about the 40 years.

14:48.690 --> 14:49.430
Where did you wander?

14:49.510 --> 14:54.055
Oh, I wandered around Oklahoma, and I wandered around Kansas, and I wandered around South Texas.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.289
All right, you went to be serviced at what age?

14:57.870 --> 14:58.450
What did he say?

14:59.411 --> 15:00.212
Fifteen.

15:00.232 --> 15:00.392
Fifteen.

15:00.412 --> 15:00.572
Fifteen.

15:01.113 --> 15:01.953
Which branch?

15:01.973 --> 15:02.314
The Army.

15:02.474 --> 15:03.154
How long were you in?

15:03.234 --> 15:05.436
Oh, about two, two and a half years altogether.

15:05.997 --> 15:07.238
You see, he's very cagey.

15:07.318 --> 15:09.940
He was in the Army for two and a half years altogether.

15:11.282 --> 15:12.042
But that's total.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.004
When he goes in later, it was Richard H. Moore.

15:14.905 --> 15:20.690
When they found out he was fifteen years old, that explains, you see, now the whole thing makes perfect sense to me.

15:21.270 --> 15:24.413
When they discovered that they had this fifteen-year-old kid in the Army,

15:25.844 --> 15:26.845
They mustered him out.

15:27.406 --> 15:29.449
But, you know, he's not a criminal.

15:30.450 --> 15:33.814
You aren't angry that a young man wants to serve his country in wartime.

15:33.974 --> 15:34.956
You don't make it hard on him.

15:34.976 --> 15:39.622
You allow him to go out under the name by which he came in.

15:39.882 --> 15:40.303
Am I right?

15:40.883 --> 15:42.946
I mean, the documentation shows that.

15:42.966 --> 15:45.089
It was an honorable discharge when they found out his age.

15:45.589 --> 15:51.417
It was an honorable discharge, and that's why he buried the paperwork down in North Carolina.

15:51.697 --> 15:52.999
A pattern, by the way,

15:53.317 --> 16:05.915
which he learned from and which he used again, which is why it's so certain, when he was setting up the limited partnership here in Massachusetts and burying the paperwork, and I'm pointing west, 120 miles west of Poughkeepsie.

16:06.155 --> 16:07.217
That's west.

16:07.237 --> 16:07.858
That's what he did.

16:08.158 --> 16:11.723
The same exact scenario, and guess what?

16:11.823 --> 16:12.224
It worked.

16:12.304 --> 16:12.785
It was good.

16:13.826 --> 16:15.569
Well, to a degree, you know.

16:15.749 --> 16:19.855
I mean, I'm not the one who broke it prior to the dissolution of the book collection.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.058
Somebody found that stuff.

16:22.628 --> 16:23.589
But here you go.

16:23.870 --> 16:25.172
You can have this.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.175
This is fantastic.

16:27.195 --> 16:27.596
That would be great.

16:27.616 --> 16:38.452
If I didn't have this, if it wasn't for my appearance on C-SPAN, I'd have been in the wedding spirit.

16:38.492 --> 16:39.594
Maybe I did get it wrong.

16:40.335 --> 16:40.996
I wouldn't have known.

16:41.116 --> 16:44.622
I mean, it wouldn't have occurred to me that he lied about his age and ended at the age of 15.

16:44.642 --> 16:46.344
And he didn't know I had this when he came.

16:46.565 --> 16:48.147
And so then when I lied, I said, guess what?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.070
We know about the Kansas case.

16:50.624 --> 16:51.705
He ran away.

16:51.725 --> 16:56.230
I asked Hayden about his war record, about his early years of war record.

16:56.310 --> 16:56.931
Yeah, that's yours.

16:57.512 --> 16:59.274
Thank you.

16:59.294 --> 17:02.137
And we'll collate it before you go with the original.

17:02.277 --> 17:04.379
I think that goes on for the pages.

17:04.439 --> 17:07.743
If not, we'll copy the other ones to make sure you have the whole thing.

17:09.405 --> 17:18.775
Hayden talked only of, he segued from talking about his childhood and his relationship with his father into Korea.

17:19.261 --> 17:23.127
Want to see a picture of him when he was in the service?

17:23.207 --> 17:25.932
I'd love to see a picture of him.

17:25.952 --> 17:26.132
Go ahead.

17:26.152 --> 17:26.473
I'm teasing you.

17:26.493 --> 17:31.361
It's going to be a long day, isn't it?

17:31.781 --> 17:39.514
He talks of going into a servicing career in...

17:47.493 --> 17:51.379
The Korean War broke out during the 23rd 50.

17:51.760 --> 17:55.225
He was in his unit two days after that.

17:55.505 --> 17:57.709
An infantry unit.

18:00.153 --> 18:02.316
Before that he'd been at Fort Benham in Georgia.

18:03.738 --> 18:07.304
Airborne training and Ranger training.

18:07.965 --> 18:10.228
Then he was dispatched after graduating.

18:10.248 --> 18:11.811
He shipped to China in 1948.

18:11.931 --> 18:15.897
He left China to avoid the communist invasion in 1949.

18:16.535 --> 18:26.087
When he left to avoid the communist invasion in 1949, he went to Japan and then Korea.

18:27.869 --> 18:31.433
He enlisted in the army because of the economic state in the US.

18:31.854 --> 18:38.842
At the time, he says he was selling women's shoes, he was being an elevator boy, he was living on 75 bucks a month.

18:39.924 --> 18:44.449
He took him past exams for direct army commission, he chose the infantry, went to Benning.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.627
where he had infantry training, he said.

18:46.808 --> 18:56.499
So that's three different versions of training he had at Benning College, Georgia, and that's within the space of a sort of 10-15 minute conversation.

18:56.519 --> 19:01.665
He was also tired of university life, he says, at that time he was also at French University in Wichita.

19:03.187 --> 19:08.753
He says that in Korea he was at the scene of, this is a direct quotation, the heaviest military combat ever faced by U.S.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.074
forces.

19:09.454 --> 19:10.115
Is that Joe's arm?

19:10.856 --> 19:11.977
Yeah, but it's not true.

19:11.997 --> 19:12.698
I'm simply

19:13.319 --> 19:15.561
I've got to ignore that.

19:15.581 --> 19:29.016
He was there versus the Chinese, and he subsequently, having survived that, served General Willoughby, who was MacArthur's chief of intelligence.

19:29.036 --> 19:30.738
Thank you.

19:31.039 --> 19:43.292
He was in charge of a section that was providing daily intelligence briefings on the Korean front, and the report was taken to MacArthur, who checked it, sent it to Washington from the chief of staff and the president.

19:43.711 --> 19:46.235
He says that MacArthur and Willoughby asked him to stay in the army.

19:46.535 --> 19:55.688
He declined even after an offer of promotion to Major.

19:56.389 --> 20:02.398
He was charged with taking a top-secret document to India and was told to consider himself discharged once he delivered it.

20:03.940 --> 20:09.808
That's the history of his military service.

20:09.828 --> 20:12.452
We've got his VA records yet.

20:15.689 --> 20:21.258
Nicole, please.

20:21.278 --> 20:23.282
Do you want a review of the movie?

20:27.970 --> 20:28.971
Two pages of each.

20:28.991 --> 20:32.297
This is going to be tough, so really put it way down.

20:32.497 --> 21:01.693
I think before lunch we were talking about Hagan and Moore's version of his documentary record as opposed to the one that you had.

21:01.876 --> 21:16.795
I put them on the stairs, but they're gone now.

21:16.815 --> 21:21.561
Okay, maybe they're in here.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.582
Did you get a copy of this?

21:22.662 --> 21:24.825
Yep, I'll just read.

21:27.989 --> 21:30.752
Okay, let me just...

21:31.643 --> 21:34.726
We might have to make sure that it's logical.

21:34.746 --> 21:37.588
Well, this is how it came to me.

21:37.608 --> 21:41.832
It is up a piece of microphone.

21:42.032 --> 21:48.738
We could take these, but... Yeah, they take us at the best.

21:48.758 --> 21:49.719
Yeah, that's the best.

21:49.779 --> 21:51.880
Now, this was sent to us, but it is very good.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.182
You really want to have this.

21:53.202 --> 21:54.923
It's obviously from a negative.

21:56.004 --> 21:59.587
It's Richard Haven Moore, Austin, Texas.

21:59.607 --> 22:00.328
Can you make that out?

22:00.408 --> 22:00.688
Yeah.

22:01.478 --> 22:08.904
This is the one I got.

22:08.944 --> 22:16.111
And then down below is the official name change which he did here in Massachusetts to Heyman O'Moore.

22:16.131 --> 22:19.453
Alright, so let's superimpose on the original book.

22:19.473 --> 22:20.334
They were put together.

22:20.354 --> 22:24.338
These were given to my lawyer by his lawyer.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.258
Amazing.

22:25.278 --> 22:30.743
These were documents I was trying to find for years and handed over to him.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.522
That's what it is.

22:35.603 --> 22:36.905
Can you make out these numbers?

22:36.925 --> 22:37.766
That's very important.

22:37.786 --> 22:39.348
One, six, four, five, six.

22:39.488 --> 22:43.954
Well, now you have the official document where he became Haven O. Moore from Richard H. Moore.

22:43.974 --> 22:45.556
And this is filed where?

22:45.576 --> 22:46.757
Is this the Central Bureau?

22:46.837 --> 22:48.439
That is in Boston, Massachusetts.

22:48.459 --> 22:52.925
That is actually Middlesex, Court of Middlesex, which is Cambridge.

22:53.065 --> 22:56.730
Probate court, so that's right in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Richard Haven Moore.

22:57.115 --> 23:04.625
There's his birth date down there, where he was born, and then that's what the name is changed to, and then the filing number is 16457.

23:04.785 --> 23:09.331
And is this freely available to anyone who's requesting it?

23:09.351 --> 23:10.752
These are public records.

23:10.813 --> 23:13.316
But you have to know where they are.

23:13.456 --> 23:18.062
Is that merely American citizens, or could anyone from the United States?

23:18.883 --> 23:20.144
Anyone from the United States?

23:20.164 --> 23:20.445
Anyone.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.768
I agree with that.

23:22.788 --> 23:23.288
These are public records.

23:23.309 --> 23:23.409
Okay.

23:23.429 --> 23:24.490
These are public records.

23:25.516 --> 23:27.920
And I didn't have these when I wrote General Madness.

23:27.940 --> 23:35.552
Not that they were necessary, but what he really had here is the documentation on his identity.

23:35.572 --> 23:39.759
So there was a very important document, yeah.

23:39.959 --> 23:43.685
There was quite a long period of time where he was known as Habermann Moore, but not officially.

23:45.047 --> 23:45.989
That's the point.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.052
For example, the movie was made in 73.

23:48.353 --> 23:52.840
And when you have an opportunity to read the deposition, he will tell you that he went through life

23:54.473 --> 24:00.281
calling himself Haven O'War, when in fact he was really calling himself Haven O'War.

24:01.703 --> 24:07.191
Maybe he was calling himself Haven O'War, but he changed the name legally in 1974 to Haven O'War.

24:07.231 --> 24:15.322
Now I have a theory as to why he did this at that particular time, even though he may well have been calling himself Haven O'War for many years prior to that.

24:15.342 --> 24:16.364
The answer is very simple.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.468
The answer is that he had just met Michael Davis,

24:20.444 --> 24:34.018
And as you will see, when I have the other documents here, when they started doing property transactions, when they started establishing the Dolphin Realty Trucks, when they started establishing the Institute of Traditional Science, which Michael was the principal of.

24:34.038 --> 24:35.879
Michael was the money and all of these things.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.723
Clearly, Haven's name was going to appear on any of these documents.

24:39.763 --> 24:45.189
He wanted it to appear as Haven O'Moore, but the only way he could do that legally is to be named, to be Haven O'Moore.

24:45.649 --> 24:50.434
And so now, even though he had been calling himself by that name for all these years, so he claims

24:51.730 --> 24:54.333
That's when he legally changed the name.

24:54.353 --> 24:59.578
But it was really, I believe, done to expedite the transactions with Davis.

24:59.818 --> 25:14.753
Once Davis had taken that hook, once Haven had seen for the cleanification he had landed, worth millions and millions of dollars, I mean, a con man's greatest dream come true, which is what this guy is.

25:14.773 --> 25:17.216
He's a snake oil sales and so on, Shackley Products.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.358
That's what he is.

25:19.591 --> 25:29.022
What he has now found is Michael Davis, and they set about doing the things that I've documented in that case in Cambridge, which is fully impounded.

25:29.042 --> 25:31.405
You ask if you can go and see these records?

25:31.425 --> 25:32.146
Of course you can.

25:32.766 --> 25:37.132
You should also be able to go to that courthouse and see that case file.

25:38.033 --> 25:39.074
This is egregious.

25:39.134 --> 25:43.219
This violates every law that we have.

25:44.741 --> 25:48.805
Our courts, as are yours, this is not the Stark Chamber.

25:48.825 --> 25:49.446
This is done

25:50.354 --> 25:58.685
in a superior court, and the public has allowed to come in and examine, to observe and to examine.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.629
And they have impounded the whole thing.

26:02.289 --> 26:09.819
Let me pick your brain, American law, or as much as you know about it, because whatever it is, it's going to be more than me.

26:10.400 --> 26:15.246
What steps have to be taken in order to take public documents out of the public domain?

26:15.647 --> 26:18.150
How would this have been done?

26:19.818 --> 26:20.839
You mean to see the records?

26:20.879 --> 26:23.543
No, to prevent other people seeing the records.

26:23.623 --> 26:27.409
How would that case have been taken out of public domain?

26:27.509 --> 26:30.012
I've been an investigative journalist now.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.295
I've been a journalist for 30 years.

26:33.237 --> 26:40.187
I've got a few awards to document my facility.

26:40.988 --> 26:42.670
I've never seen anything like it.

26:42.690 --> 26:44.513
Lawyers I talk to don't believe it.

26:44.833 --> 26:46.956
Another guy called me, another lawyer,

26:47.527 --> 26:51.132
He said he was going to try and see if he could find out about this stuff.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.394
Nobody has ever heard of this.

26:52.414 --> 26:56.580
The fact that you can impound a whole case like that, it's unheard of.

26:57.321 --> 26:59.524
To answer your question, what does it take?

26:59.805 --> 27:01.287
I think it takes money and influence.

27:01.367 --> 27:02.208
That's what it takes.

27:02.268 --> 27:12.403
I'm not suggesting bribery here, but I'm certainly suggesting a tremendous amount of influence by very, very influential people on both sides, plaintiff and defendant,

27:13.430 --> 27:19.879
You see, it was not in the best interest of either side of this dispute to have the differences aired.

27:20.640 --> 27:27.689
Generally speaking, somebody's got an agenda here where it serves my purposes to have this thing come out in the public.

27:27.709 --> 27:36.481
It didn't serve the best interest of the Davises, and it didn't serve the best interest of... I think that's incidental, isn't it?

27:36.521 --> 27:38.644
Because you went along to...

27:38.827 --> 27:45.656
When you were researching the book, a gentleman, you went along to the Middlesex Superior Court to see the records.

27:45.717 --> 27:48.921
You went away, they told you to come back in two weeks or whatever.

27:48.961 --> 27:52.206
When you came back, the whole case had disappeared.

27:54.188 --> 28:00.497
Now, clearly there was great animosity between O'Moore and the Davis family at the time of the case.

28:00.916 --> 28:03.660
I don't believe they colluded in keeping it out of the public.

28:03.780 --> 28:06.103
No, I think they did.

28:06.183 --> 28:06.484
Do you?

28:06.504 --> 28:07.746
Yeah, I can prove it.

28:07.866 --> 28:08.406
I can prove it.

28:08.426 --> 28:18.380
You can prove it, I'll stop talking, because it seems to me that the Davis side of the case... This is now an impounded document.

28:18.801 --> 28:26.772
The day I suspected that there was a case called Davis, individual and as trustee,

28:26.971 --> 28:28.934
We will make you a copy of this.

28:29.074 --> 28:32.499
There's a statement or more, an individual, and a trustee at all.

28:32.539 --> 28:33.741
Nobody else has seen this.

28:34.442 --> 28:36.004
These are the counsels for the defendant.

28:36.024 --> 28:37.286
Look at all the friggin' lawyers here.

28:37.906 --> 28:40.991
Dittler, Leland, Huntington, Woodard Leader.

28:41.031 --> 28:43.755
This is a major... They're both at 60 states.

28:43.775 --> 28:46.919
I mean, isn't that kind of a touch of irony?

28:46.959 --> 28:50.845
This is... This is tail and door.

28:51.025 --> 28:54.230
What's the number one biggest, most famous law firm in London?

28:54.290 --> 28:55.932
That's the equivalent here in Boston.

28:56.249 --> 29:01.336
This is a retainer of $20,000 just to sit down on the desk and tell them what you want them to do.

29:01.376 --> 29:08.305
This now is an impounded... Is that a jury, Charles?

29:08.325 --> 29:09.807
You're not trying to tell you.

29:09.828 --> 29:10.709
This is a case.

29:10.729 --> 29:13.332
This is a commonwealth of Massachusetts.

29:13.653 --> 29:15.115
I don't know.

29:15.135 --> 29:18.259
I don't know whether it's a hearing in front of a judge or with a jury.

29:18.279 --> 29:18.760
It's a jury.

29:18.780 --> 29:19.401
They're a juror.

29:19.461 --> 29:22.725
You see, this is called the docket sheet.

29:22.865 --> 29:24.147
What we're doing is reading...

29:24.953 --> 29:28.578
The summary of the case and various outlines.

29:28.598 --> 29:36.208
So on January 29, 1988, number one was a complaint with demand for jury trial.

29:36.228 --> 29:37.871
It doesn't mean there was a jury trial.

29:37.911 --> 29:47.163
That was the first item that was plaintiff's motion for appointment of a temporary receiver for the affairs of the Garden Limited Institute of Traditional Science and the Dolphin Realty Trust.

29:47.364 --> 29:50.508
So you see, when I had these, I know where to look.

29:50.528 --> 29:53.492
And you'll see later that, thank God I got this, because...

29:53.692 --> 29:56.196
Later, this whole thing was impounded.

29:56.216 --> 29:59.362
8888-635.

29:59.462 --> 30:08.879
That means 1988, this is in the Superior Court of Massachusetts, Middlesex County, and case number 635, Davis v. O'Moore.

30:08.899 --> 30:12.004
Now, if you go and you ask to see that case now,

30:13.267 --> 30:18.231
What you're going to find is this 12 pages, so we're going to make you a full copy of that.

30:18.311 --> 30:19.933
And this is what you also want.

30:20.393 --> 30:25.277
We'll have to make sure I have another copy of it before you go.

30:26.118 --> 30:31.522
I think I do, but if not, we'll send the call downstairs to make another copy of it.

30:31.542 --> 30:34.825
These are all documents that are now out of the register.

30:34.845 --> 30:42.852
You will copy these, anything you want.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.862
Okay, okay, but to jump ahead.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.883
There was a demand for not a jury trial.

30:46.984 --> 30:49.166
Now listen, you've got to see this.

30:49.246 --> 30:54.090
Now I go back a couple weeks, I go in, I see this docket sheet.

30:54.110 --> 30:56.212
I make a copy.

30:56.953 --> 30:57.453
And the elephant?

30:58.134 --> 30:58.574
Okay.

30:58.674 --> 30:59.215
Okay.

30:59.415 --> 30:59.695
Sorry, guys.

30:59.715 --> 31:00.877
Would you prefer that thing?

31:00.897 --> 31:04.200
If we just get the wax mints, just so we know that there's a second copy?

31:05.060 --> 31:05.641
Yeah.

31:05.741 --> 31:10.866
Anything I give you, I've got to, I mean, just don't go far away now.

31:10.886 --> 31:11.486
I won't.

31:12.688 --> 31:13.108
There it is.

31:13.207 --> 31:16.192
Copy that from the bottom up.

31:17.173 --> 31:17.574
All right.

31:18.475 --> 31:18.675
Bottom up.

31:18.695 --> 31:18.876
Okay.

31:19.376 --> 31:20.178
Thank you.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.119
Copy this too.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.603
Now I'll make you get your better one.

31:23.623 --> 31:24.744
This is not that good.

31:24.785 --> 31:25.506
Now I go back.

31:25.566 --> 31:27.469
Yeah, now look.

31:27.489 --> 31:28.130
Even the name.

31:28.530 --> 31:29.912
The whole thing is impounded.

31:31.214 --> 31:37.003
You go into this courthouse now and you ask to see the darkened sheet for 8-8-6-3-5.

31:37.253 --> 31:40.356
I said, I want a certified copy of this blank sheet of paper.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.258
You're going to pay $2.50 for a blank piece of paper?

31:42.278 --> 31:42.938
I said, yes, I am.

31:44.039 --> 31:46.361
And the woman says, and I said, trust me, I really am.

31:46.582 --> 31:52.087
I really want a certified copy of this blank sheet of paper, you know, because I'm getting screwed.

31:52.587 --> 31:54.048
And nobody's been kissing me.

31:54.128 --> 31:57.792
I mean, I'm getting, you know, remember that line?

31:57.872 --> 31:58.432
And Doug, yeah, yeah.

31:58.452 --> 31:59.413
You guys just kiss me, kiss me.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.255
What are you talking about?

32:01.275 --> 32:02.016
He says, I'm getting fucked up.

32:02.036 --> 32:03.197
I'm getting fucked up.

32:03.217 --> 32:03.877
I'm getting fucked up.

32:03.897 --> 32:04.678
I'm getting fucked up.

32:04.698 --> 32:05.159
I'm getting fucked up.

32:05.179 --> 32:05.619
I'm getting fucked up.

32:05.639 --> 32:06.220
I'm getting fucked up.

32:06.240 --> 32:06.720
I'm getting fucked up.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.093
That is the judge somebody gave us to me.

32:09.213 --> 32:09.994
Oh, right.

32:10.014 --> 32:10.535
Uh-huh.

32:10.555 --> 32:14.301
Yeah, that is she.

32:14.521 --> 32:14.621
Okay.

32:15.402 --> 32:16.904
Now, we will make that.

32:16.924 --> 32:18.547
I've got so many copies of this.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.009
I'm trying to find it.

32:20.089 --> 32:20.590
Let's see.

32:20.670 --> 32:21.992
You can have this.

32:22.012 --> 32:23.174
We'll probably make you another.

32:23.554 --> 32:26.699
But why—oh, this is a whole sequence of the darker sheets.

32:27.801 --> 32:27.981
Why?

32:28.001 --> 32:29.864
You say to me, how do I know they colluded?

32:31.526 --> 32:32.087
All right.

32:32.768 --> 32:36.133
Case starts January 29, 1988.

32:37.312 --> 32:43.238
On April 7th, 1989, thirteen months or so later, this is it.

32:43.258 --> 32:44.279
This is typed in.

32:44.299 --> 32:49.605
After all this other stuff has been handwritten, you have to read these very carefully, because this is the words out of stone.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.207
This is where you get Gutierrez's name.

32:51.227 --> 32:54.470
This is where you get his father's name, Leonard Davis.

32:54.811 --> 32:58.895
And this is an official public document, so I can use this with impunity.

32:59.135 --> 32:59.776
You understand?

32:59.796 --> 33:05.462
I mean, I can put this in print and nobody can bust my balls on it, because this is a public document.

33:06.252 --> 33:11.819
But at the end of the case, they reached a resolution, an out-of-court agreement.

33:11.839 --> 33:16.605
So that's not going to—the judge does not have to rule.

33:16.625 --> 33:24.355
The smart money says that they were going to fine against Hayden, but if he continued to fine.

33:26.158 --> 33:32.306
But apparently it was made clear to him that he continued to believe that there will be criminal charges filed.

33:32.326 --> 33:34.909
We're going to let you off because the Davises did not want

33:35.750 --> 33:37.912
How do I know this?

33:39.394 --> 33:41.416
All right, this is it.

33:43.078 --> 33:44.119
We're reaching now.

33:44.560 --> 33:49.065
Depositions outside the commonwealth have been taken, motions, blah, blah, blah.

33:49.085 --> 33:50.607
You'd have to figure out who these people are.

33:51.248 --> 33:54.691
It's been a few years since I've looked at this, but this is very important.

33:54.711 --> 33:57.975
Stipulation regarding disclosure of confidential information.

33:58.736 --> 34:03.141
On April 29, 1988, the parties by their respective counsel

34:03.728 --> 34:08.578
entered into a stipulation to protect the confidentiality of certain information.

34:08.818 --> 34:21.604
They signed to it, they agreed to it, which is why I knew that there's no way in the world, even no more, could ever come and sue me for anything, because then I would say, we are going to demand that you open up that case.

34:21.624 --> 34:25.872
And if I think of that, he would be violating this confidentiality agreement.

34:26.105 --> 34:31.171
that he entered into with the Davises, by which I believe they gave him money to shut up and get the hell lost.

34:31.191 --> 34:31.552
Yeah.

34:31.572 --> 34:34.976
I think that's... Just keep on going.

34:35.036 --> 34:42.325
Whenever he says, I'm reluctant to be involved in this because of my privacy, he's under a legal requirement.

34:42.565 --> 34:42.786
Read it.

34:42.846 --> 34:43.346
Read it.

34:43.366 --> 34:44.768
You can have this.

34:44.808 --> 34:52.838
Pursuant to the stipulation, the parties have agreed to limit disclosure of documents and other materials which identify and describe the rape books

34:53.594 --> 34:54.636
That must be rare books.

34:54.656 --> 35:03.750
Rare books and documents purchased by any of the parties in accordance with the terms of the parties now decide into discussions with self-abuse concerning the possible sale by self-abuse.

35:04.211 --> 35:19.095
And as we assist them, we will give them... The parties hereby agree that the listing of rare books and manuscripts... See, Christy Stephen did the... So all they're agreeing to is that they can talk about the books to help them to sell.

35:19.835 --> 35:28.504
Parties may disclose other information regarding rare books, but everything else, except for the disclosures disclosed with it, the stipulations shall remain in full force and effect.

35:28.704 --> 35:33.509
Which he also watched out of it, Mr. Big Sartegy, when you were there, and the dice running up.

35:33.650 --> 35:35.572
Well, not really.

35:35.712 --> 35:41.218
I think Stephen told me what he did, because he was pissed off furiously that he lost the sale to Self-Adese.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.280
He didn't know about what was in his statue.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.002
You can have this.

35:45.022 --> 35:45.442
That's yours.

35:46.643 --> 35:47.344
That's pretty nice.

35:47.695 --> 36:14.833
that's okay that's the whole thing and we will collate it against and if you want you know the shoots are this longer and when i copied this i didn't have a copy machine have you got a copy of this okay the appraisal by the way the appraisal i think you're saying the book i'll have a look the appraisal didn't take place in bangles it took place at most house oh i'm not so sure about that steven master said he took place at most okay um he said that um

36:15.590 --> 36:21.198
Because, I mean, I remember this particularly, because he's the only guy who has given me any sort of money.

36:21.218 --> 36:21.558
Yeah, I think so.

36:21.598 --> 36:21.859
I think so.

36:21.879 --> 36:22.259
You know what?

36:22.319 --> 36:22.800
I think so.

36:22.820 --> 36:24.242
I think they did bring them from the bank.

36:24.262 --> 36:25.884
They brought them to the house.

36:26.064 --> 36:27.466
They all had to take their shoes off.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.069
It was a Japanese-style house.

36:29.149 --> 36:29.830
I think so.

36:29.910 --> 36:30.290
That's right.

36:30.531 --> 36:33.395
That's right, yeah.

36:33.415 --> 36:34.656
That's right.

36:34.676 --> 36:36.319
Okay, I'm sorry to go off like that.

36:36.339 --> 36:41.386
No, you know, you've got... But you also have to get a copy of the impounded document.

36:41.406 --> 36:42.407
That's also...

36:43.147 --> 36:45.791
So this is the history of the rioters.

36:46.211 --> 36:48.275
That's the key.

36:48.315 --> 36:50.358
That was subsequently impounded when you went back.

36:50.438 --> 36:52.381
That is now an impounded document.

36:52.421 --> 36:58.650
What you're holding now, even though it is an official public document, is now impounded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

36:58.670 --> 37:06.581
Subsequent to, and I'll show you the letters, and it was impounded only, well, this you've got to have, but it doesn't have a copy of it.

37:06.601 --> 37:10.046
That's a copy of the Power of Attorney that Michael Davis gives to Hayden.

37:10.066 --> 37:11.128
Oh, yeah.

37:12.475 --> 37:15.239
Have you got this?

37:16.100 --> 37:17.182
This is very important.

37:17.802 --> 37:28.157
This you may not be able to get now, because the Massachusetts... It used to be that our driver's license numbers were also... Oh, aren't you sweet!

37:29.419 --> 37:30.680
Thank you very much.

37:30.961 --> 37:35.387
Thank you very much.

37:35.407 --> 37:36.829
I got these all over the place.

37:39.003 --> 37:44.770
It used to be that our social security number, which it says right there, our social security number is also your license number.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.674
Driver's licenses in the United States are public documents.

37:47.694 --> 37:48.715
They're sort of IDs.

37:49.155 --> 37:52.359
They are IDs, but they're also public documents.

37:52.600 --> 37:59.168
You can go right now to the Registry of Motor Vehicles and pay $5 and get a copy of my driver's license.

37:59.228 --> 38:02.932
I've changed it so my social security number, they now allow you to do that.

38:02.952 --> 38:05.195
I mean, I learned myself that I could do it legally.

38:05.235 --> 38:07.778
I said, shit, I don't want people to only get my social security number.

38:08.028 --> 38:11.013
But this is how I got the Social Security number.

38:11.033 --> 38:14.939
So you see, for him to claim that I got the wrong guy, I didn't get the wrong guy.

38:15.059 --> 38:15.740
You can have that.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.082
That's the Social Security number.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.065
Here's the actual value.

38:19.105 --> 38:20.848
Now, I didn't block this stuff out.

38:20.908 --> 38:22.310
Now, what is confidential?

38:22.370 --> 38:22.951
This is the one.

38:22.971 --> 38:23.992
This is the actual original.

38:24.293 --> 38:27.037
I also got Lorea here, by the way.

38:27.057 --> 38:28.519
You don't need Lorea, but here she is.

38:28.579 --> 38:32.826
This is Lorea's Social Security number.

38:32.966 --> 38:34.288
In Massachusetts,

38:35.669 --> 38:41.538
Dave walked out the height of the date of birth, you know, if there was a weight there.

38:41.638 --> 38:44.422
So that turned out to be a very key thing.

38:44.502 --> 38:46.785
I would have been nice to have had that date of birth in 29.

38:47.106 --> 38:50.771
Yeah, because I might have thought twice about putting that military stuff in, you know.

38:51.432 --> 38:52.994
It would have been 15 years old.

38:53.074 --> 38:56.379
I might have said, I've got a problem here, you know.

38:56.399 --> 38:59.844
I've got a problem here.

38:59.864 --> 39:03.229
I'm convinced it's the same guy, but if I had that date of birth,

39:03.968 --> 39:05.770
So there's no negligence on my part.

39:05.790 --> 39:10.494
If anyone wants to accuse me of recklessness, negligence is the criteria that you have to apply with.

39:10.514 --> 39:18.822
I don't know what the rules are in the UK, but if somebody is guilty of libel, by the way, first of all, you have to be wrong.

39:18.902 --> 39:20.403
Number two, you have to be reckless.

39:20.423 --> 39:22.586
Number three, you have to be negligent.

39:23.086 --> 39:28.551
This is the burden of proof that is incumbent upon the plaintiff in the libel suit.

39:29.212 --> 39:30.533
First of all, I have to be wrong.

39:30.952 --> 39:33.736
Second of all, I have to have impugned your integrity and your good name.

39:34.116 --> 39:38.922
Third, I have to have acted in reckless disregard of the truth, and I have to have been malicious on top of all that.

39:39.703 --> 39:42.487
Well, I think you'll see here that I, here's a letter.

39:43.608 --> 39:45.551
This is typed in a Daisy Wheel printer.

39:45.571 --> 39:46.672
I got rid of ten years ago.

39:46.712 --> 39:49.155
This is the letter, and this is when he was Dr. O'Moore.

39:49.436 --> 39:56.605
This is the letter, the first letter I sent to O'Moore asking, I have to copy that.

39:58.255 --> 40:04.142
For him to say, I never contacted him, that was sent by a certified male, by the way.

40:04.262 --> 40:05.163
Okay, so this needs copying.

40:05.563 --> 40:07.065
If you want that.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.108
If you're prepared to... Yeah, and here it is.

40:10.128 --> 40:11.350
This is the long one.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.031
This is the one we will copy for you.

40:13.051 --> 40:15.414
This is the one that presents the sheet.

40:15.434 --> 40:19.799
That's the one I love, because that's a great conversation.

40:20.019 --> 40:22.822
And what we will do... They're all long, by the way.

40:22.842 --> 40:24.264
I've given you one that sticks.

40:25.445 --> 40:26.366
You and I will do these.

40:26.386 --> 40:27.908
We'll have to feed them on paper.

40:28.765 --> 40:30.407
This is stuff you ought to know about.

40:30.647 --> 40:41.961
The Division of Public Charities, you find out if it's a public charity, you go to the Department of the Attorney General of Boston Institute of Traditional Science.

40:43.263 --> 40:50.332
This is where you find out what the Department of Traditional Science was, the reports, the taxes they paid, like in $476.

40:50.352 --> 40:57.821
I mean, this is a cost, you know, this is a money they take.

40:57.841 --> 40:58.722
This is very interesting.

40:59.360 --> 41:03.987
Yeah, see, this is Davis.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.750
Here is the IRS who came.

41:05.770 --> 41:07.232
You know, in the U.S.

41:07.252 --> 41:08.154
Institute of Judicial.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.356
Yeah, that's a public record.

41:09.376 --> 41:10.417
That's a public record.

41:10.437 --> 41:12.380
Because it's a charitable organization.

41:12.420 --> 41:12.681
Of course.

41:12.901 --> 41:19.071
For him to claim, you see, if he were to come at me and say, I have a problem, as he's saying to you now.

41:19.091 --> 41:20.854
He's not an individual, but he's not.

41:20.874 --> 41:22.176
He's not.

41:22.196 --> 41:23.177
He's not.

41:23.197 --> 41:25.821
Once you claim... Pardon my Greek, really.

41:25.841 --> 41:26.222
No, no, no, no.

41:26.402 --> 41:27.544
I don't follow that word.

41:28.807 --> 41:49.116
Once you are a private foundation, which is, it's a traditional sign, you are required by law to file your tax return, which is known as a 990-PF public foundation, with not only with the IRS, which is with Federal Internal Industry, but also with the Attorney General of the state.

41:49.136 --> 41:53.002
That's why I'm invited to go get this.

41:53.022 --> 41:54.644
Attorney General of the public foundation.

41:54.664 --> 41:57.548
I haven't done it since 1990.

41:57.798 --> 42:00.721
If you'd better ask you to be here another day or two, we'd go again.

42:00.741 --> 42:01.281
Don't get ready.

42:01.541 --> 42:03.203
Yeah, there's no problem.

42:03.223 --> 42:04.004
We can do it anytime.

42:04.024 --> 42:04.404
It's there.

42:04.924 --> 42:05.525
You walk in.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.426
You ask to see it.

42:07.046 --> 42:08.247
You give the name, the number.

42:08.288 --> 42:10.229
There's a number right here, wherever it is.

42:10.970 --> 42:13.472
Yeah, you shouldn't write that down.

42:13.532 --> 42:15.154
That's a federal ID number.

42:15.214 --> 42:17.936
That's a very important task.

42:18.597 --> 42:27.585
Well, if you're calling to—you go in there and you ask, I'd like to see the file for a 04-2577162.

42:28.763 --> 42:33.488
You know, a piece of cake, a computer, right?

42:33.568 --> 42:34.649
This kind of stuff.

42:34.689 --> 42:35.810
Really, here's another one.

42:37.051 --> 42:37.992
This is another one.

42:38.012 --> 42:39.694
This is from Florida.

42:39.714 --> 42:43.738
This is the Leonard and Sophie Davis Foundation.

42:43.758 --> 42:47.502
Now they're talking money, you know.

42:47.522 --> 42:48.223
This is nothing.

42:48.243 --> 42:51.927
This is just stuff that they, this is for one year, this is what they just did for this year.

42:52.688 --> 42:53.168
Dividends.

42:53.485 --> 42:58.653
You see what I'm saying?

43:00.115 --> 43:02.339
Why do I have this?

43:02.860 --> 43:10.312
Because when they forced Haven, when Michael was leaving, you'll find it's that bracketed here, paperwork.

43:10.332 --> 43:11.113
It might even be here.

43:11.473 --> 43:15.540
They get a check for $200,000 to a traditional sign.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.343
Look at the value here.

43:17.363 --> 43:20.067
$19 million.

43:21.397 --> 43:22.118
This is nothing.

43:22.138 --> 43:27.123
This is money that they do, they give out for scholarships and stuff.

43:28.425 --> 43:30.527
Twenty million.

43:30.547 --> 43:31.208
Twenty million dollars.

43:31.228 --> 43:32.409
And there are increases now.

43:32.509 --> 43:34.932
There are increases.

43:34.952 --> 43:35.773
Some of these increases.

43:35.793 --> 43:38.796
Oh, come on, where is it?

43:39.097 --> 43:39.417
Is this the one?

43:39.437 --> 43:44.763
It's also an exception.

43:44.783 --> 43:48.467
Well, there's an item here where they've got a check for two hundred and forty thousand dollars.

43:49.274 --> 43:54.383
What year is this?

43:55.846 --> 43:56.226
89.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.570
Well, it might be 89.

43:59.051 --> 44:00.975
Yeah, it is.

44:02.097 --> 44:09.971
You were asking how I know that Michael was in... That's the one I've been looking for.

44:09.991 --> 44:13.577
I've been running...

44:14.722 --> 44:19.607
Now, this is Kansas a few years ago, but I would say that it's pretty difficult.

44:19.627 --> 44:21.829
Do you know who Allen Dyches is, brother?

44:21.849 --> 44:22.950
That's a brother, yeah.

44:23.791 --> 44:24.552
But again, I haven't.

44:25.352 --> 44:27.214
I didn't go after the Davis's, you know.

44:27.234 --> 44:27.755
I was scared.

44:28.135 --> 44:33.120
Yeah, well, I'm not going near them until I've got a great big league.

44:33.140 --> 44:35.042
But I think you want coffee to this.

44:35.062 --> 44:35.763
You want the whole family?

44:35.783 --> 44:36.623
That would be great, yeah.

44:36.663 --> 44:40.247
I mean, as much as you're happy sharing with me.

44:40.287 --> 44:41.368
Oh, this is Papa Sarkis.

44:41.448 --> 44:44.391
Then it shows me the...

44:48.050 --> 44:48.491
Nicky!

44:50.172 --> 44:52.695
You're all right.

44:54.578 --> 44:55.038
Oh, yes.

44:55.158 --> 44:57.000
You want this whole thing?

44:57.020 --> 44:58.182
I mean, you don't mind yourself.

45:01.305 --> 45:04.830
Sweetie, I'm sorry, but this is a big one.

45:04.850 --> 45:06.031
Do this all from the back.

45:07.192 --> 45:07.653
Do it from the back.

45:07.673 --> 45:09.415
You don't have to take it apart.

45:09.475 --> 45:10.696
So I know how to do it.

45:10.716 --> 45:12.198
If you can take it apart, take it apart.

45:12.218 --> 45:15.542
But if you take it apart, I want it to take it back together again in this order.

45:17.159 --> 45:26.054
The originals come back to me.

45:29.299 --> 45:30.902
This we will make a copy of.

45:32.184 --> 45:40.838
This is, if you were to call North Carolina right now, they wouldn't give this to you over the phone.

45:41.628 --> 45:44.994
I had to get a lawyer down there to go over and get this black hair for me.

45:45.395 --> 45:46.437
But this is fantastic.

45:46.457 --> 45:58.078
You see, when the government sent this to me, and they sent me the report, this is just a hunch, you see, generally speaking back in the 40s and the 50s.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.712
And Haven does this again, by the way, where he has this department space, which to me was a key pick.

46:06.822 --> 46:13.570
They go, even though you get this document from the government, he went and he recorded it in the Registry of Deeds.

46:13.590 --> 46:18.656
To make it, I think, official that this is where I get out of the service, and here it was, and nobody's ever going to find it.

46:19.277 --> 46:29.889
So when I got that other document from the government that said he was mustered out in wherever it was, North Carolina, I called the courthouse down there, and they had this, but they wouldn't give it to me on the phone.

46:30.490 --> 46:33.293
So I got a lawyer who went and he got it.

46:33.313 --> 46:33.994
Here's his document.

46:34.615 --> 46:44.364
the Army of the United States, the Honorable District, and that's the score by the Haven Moore, the service member, private, first company, blah, blah, blah.

46:44.584 --> 46:46.005
We'll make a copy of that.

46:46.065 --> 46:47.166
I'm going to have time to look at that?

46:47.286 --> 46:47.807
Yeah, sure.

46:49.729 --> 46:54.653
That's not in Haven's hand, by the way.

46:54.873 --> 46:55.374
No.

46:55.434 --> 46:55.954
This is 44.

46:55.974 --> 47:02.580
Yeah, yeah, that's, all it does is, Haven is suggesting that I've got the wrong Haven Moore there.

47:04.383 --> 47:08.549
When enlisted or inducted, he was twenty— Yeah, that's in the book.

47:08.589 --> 47:09.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:09.130 --> 47:12.535
But it also says, about a profession of harm, save my ass.

47:13.136 --> 47:24.012
I believe this document—just believe that this document was actually constructed to obfuscate him.

47:24.032 --> 47:26.976
And it was registered down there because, hey, he was a kid.

47:27.537 --> 47:30.040
He wasn't—he was trying to serve his country in wartime.

47:30.361 --> 47:33.225
You don't want to criminalize the young lad for this.

47:33.610 --> 47:34.171
You're happy.

47:34.211 --> 47:37.395
You say, hey, you know, you're too young, son.

47:37.495 --> 47:38.897
Come on back in a couple years.

47:38.957 --> 47:40.599
We'd love to have you back in the army.

47:40.619 --> 47:42.561
You don't want to send this kid to prison.

47:42.581 --> 47:44.263
You don't want to impugn his name forever.

47:44.924 --> 47:46.726
You do want to show some compassion, right?

47:47.287 --> 47:56.158
So what they did, clearly, they certainly gave him an arrow to stretch under the name of Haven Moore, which he says in the deposition that is the name he used from the age of 13 on,

47:56.864 --> 47:59.627
And obviously you're going to lie about your age to go into the army.

47:59.647 --> 48:02.850
You're not going to use your real name, which is Richard H. Moore, which is readily discernible.

48:02.910 --> 48:07.515
If you're 18, you use the name of Haven Moore, and you say, I'm 18.

48:07.776 --> 48:11.340
I swear, they find we need warm bodies to go to Normandy anyway to take him.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.402
Then they find out that he's a baby, and they let him out.

48:14.483 --> 48:19.669
But you see, all right, they said he couldn't read.

48:20.750 --> 48:22.011
He had to sign him to the next.

48:24.539 --> 48:25.140
character.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.121
Unreadable.

48:26.161 --> 48:27.162
Very interesting.

48:27.683 --> 48:29.605
What do you mean you don't—what's not readable?

48:31.167 --> 48:34.231
I'm looking for that.

48:34.251 --> 48:36.374
This one kind of scared me a little bit.

48:36.594 --> 48:37.335
He was a farmer.

48:38.096 --> 48:39.198
He had brown eyes.

48:39.778 --> 48:41.561
Why would he have said that he couldn't have black eyes?

48:41.581 --> 48:42.742
You don't want a signature or not?

48:44.524 --> 48:46.547
Well, because I think

48:47.371 --> 48:49.213
I mean, that's not going to cite you.

48:49.233 --> 48:50.934
Well, because it's David Moore.

48:51.115 --> 48:52.896
He's really Richard H. Moore.

48:53.017 --> 48:56.180
Well, he's going to say, I'm dumb.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.321
I'm illiterate.

48:57.681 --> 48:59.563
He's not signing his name to any document.

48:59.583 --> 49:00.143
That's a lie.

49:00.164 --> 49:01.645
I think he's got some really good advice there.

49:02.686 --> 49:10.293
I think they enabled him and allowed him to get out without hurting himself in the future.

49:10.353 --> 49:17.040
And then when he finally does go back into the military again, a couple of years later, and he goes to Korea, he goes in as Richard H. Moore.

49:17.543 --> 49:20.447
Everything military you're going to find now is Richard H. Moore.

49:21.348 --> 49:22.930
Not even Richard.

49:23.190 --> 49:24.031
Richard H. Moore.

49:27.035 --> 49:27.195
You see?

49:27.215 --> 49:28.637
Well, but it says here that he's colored.

49:29.599 --> 49:35.947
That's what I'm trying to find in it right now.

49:36.047 --> 49:37.208
How about the big one?

49:37.228 --> 49:41.093
You going to do the big one?

49:42.055 --> 49:43.076
We'll do this later.

49:43.116 --> 49:45.199
I'll get big papers so we can make it large.

49:45.299 --> 49:46.200
I'll give that.

49:47.176 --> 49:54.006
And here is, here is, here is, in fact, I've got big paper.

49:54.026 --> 49:56.389
So this is the original document.

49:57.731 --> 49:59.333
This is just, this is the key.

49:59.513 --> 50:01.596
This, this, this, and it allows general madness.

50:01.837 --> 50:04.801
This to me, that is what I bought that day.

50:05.121 --> 50:06.463
That's the paper that came on.

50:06.483 --> 50:08.326
That is the document.

50:08.346 --> 50:13.794
That is the now impounded document.

50:13.814 --> 50:14.935
I've got paper this big.

50:14.955 --> 50:16.137
You can print this.

50:16.420 --> 50:17.341
Yeah, we'll do it.

50:17.421 --> 50:20.265
I have Nicole.

50:20.285 --> 50:23.409
The one I gave you is like this.

50:23.529 --> 50:30.999
Ask me some questions if you want.

50:33.282 --> 50:34.243
Oh, yeah.

50:37.187 --> 50:37.287
Okay.

50:37.327 --> 50:38.128
Do you have this?

50:40.251 --> 50:41.512
These are the exponents.

50:41.532 --> 50:42.073
Yeah.

50:42.307 --> 50:46.933
I certainly want condom, because I already have the catalog, but without the estimates, I know the estimates.

50:46.973 --> 50:47.754
You got a memo?

50:47.774 --> 50:47.994
Okay.

50:50.377 --> 50:52.920
All right, here's a comment.

50:53.241 --> 50:56.064
We've got a copy of this, but you should definitely have a copy of this.

50:56.765 --> 51:06.578
This is the letter I wrote to the Chief Superior Judge in charge of demanding that they allow me access to these public records.

51:07.158 --> 51:08.500
This is the letter I get back.

51:09.323 --> 51:16.333
This letter is in response to a letter to this office stated, December 3rd, 1989, concerning Exit Davis, Middle Six, blah, blah, blah.

51:16.353 --> 51:21.861
According to First Assistant Court, this case has been impounded and is not available for us.

51:21.881 --> 51:27.910
So they have impounded it after a journalist has asked to see it, not before.

51:28.631 --> 51:34.960
So it's political, and it's personal, and it's got nothing to do... I mean, it had not been impounded prior to this.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.605
It was impounded only when a person was exercising...

51:38.872 --> 51:42.317
his legal right to examine public records that it was impounded.

51:42.417 --> 51:45.082
And this is the absolute documental secret.

51:45.963 --> 51:46.444
We could have that.

51:46.464 --> 51:48.767
That doesn't have to be copy, because I have to copy from it all along.

51:48.887 --> 51:50.230
You've got copies of both of them?

51:50.250 --> 51:51.111
That I don't have.

51:51.131 --> 51:52.313
We'll have to copy that.

51:52.333 --> 51:56.479
We'll just put it over there and copy it.

51:56.539 --> 51:58.582
Yeah, right.

51:58.602 --> 51:59.384
This is just one file.

51:59.404 --> 52:01.227
Would you like a copy of Haven's card?

52:03.089 --> 52:05.453
Can we give you one?

52:07.120 --> 52:09.404
No phone number.

52:09.424 --> 52:11.387
You should get the David Waxman card, too.

52:11.407 --> 52:14.052
That's the best mind and the best interest.

52:15.073 --> 52:16.456
Do it about the one thing.

52:16.476 --> 52:19.781
I'll put the paper with it.

52:19.801 --> 52:21.104
Hey, dear Dr. O'Moore.

52:21.284 --> 52:25.611
I'm going to call him Dr. O'Moore.

52:25.631 --> 52:28.436
There's better be a side friend.

52:28.456 --> 52:32.723
I thought I might put them in the variety, if that's okay with you.

52:33.260 --> 52:34.641
No, I mean, I don't know.

52:34.721 --> 52:35.983
I work a long time.

52:36.003 --> 52:38.925
I think I'd say you'd say three years or five years.

52:39.106 --> 52:41.968
You know, I've been sitting up here just on this chapter.

52:42.048 --> 52:45.111
It's a very, you know, it's very generous of you to share the work.

52:46.593 --> 52:48.154
Well, I don't know.

52:48.214 --> 52:50.136
That's a lot of footwork, isn't it?

52:50.196 --> 52:54.320
And in some respects, I mean, the footwork wouldn't have been any useful.

52:54.340 --> 52:58.664
No, yeah, look, here's another copy of the big one, but we may not even have the copy.

52:58.744 --> 52:59.525
Oh, great, okay.

52:59.545 --> 53:02.828
Well, if you've got more than one copy already, then I'll just want to mention it.

53:04.158 --> 53:12.547
When I spoke to Jim Casper yesterday, I was right.

53:12.587 --> 53:18.613
When I warned you off, you know, deflected you away from coming with me, I was right.

53:19.054 --> 53:20.595
When I got there, he was quite surly.

53:21.416 --> 53:24.880
Quite difficult.

53:25.000 --> 53:32.848
He thought that I was either from the IRS or from another area of

53:33.284 --> 53:35.990
I even owe Moore's life that he didn't know about and didn't much want to.

53:36.832 --> 53:39.157
And basically he didn't believe my story.

53:39.738 --> 53:46.753
He believed me by the end and he was very courteous and very helpful and we established a good working relationship, but I think it was a good move.

53:47.037 --> 53:51.683
But he did insist that I didn't take any... I didn't take the conversation.

53:51.723 --> 53:52.384
You wouldn't allow it.

53:52.404 --> 53:52.545
No.

53:52.825 --> 53:55.328
So everything... He gave you the film.

53:55.929 --> 53:57.611
Yeah, he's got more than one copy.

53:57.631 --> 53:58.773
And he's given me that one.

53:58.913 --> 54:01.597
I mean, the deal was that I run him off a copy on the internet.

54:01.617 --> 54:02.919
Okay, you can do one for me, too.

54:02.939 --> 54:04.901
I can do that, and I'll do it.

54:05.142 --> 54:06.704
See, these are the names I was telling you about.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.046
This is interesting.

54:08.066 --> 54:09.708
I don't know who the hell this guy is.

54:09.728 --> 54:11.370
I don't know anything about him.

54:11.390 --> 54:12.812
And I don't know who this guy is either.

54:12.832 --> 54:15.576
But these were directors of the Institute of Traditional Sciences.

54:16.552 --> 54:18.435
See, that's a mail drop.

54:18.455 --> 54:22.661
Michael never looked up in England, I'm sure.

54:22.681 --> 54:24.423
Who these guys are, I checked them out.

54:24.443 --> 54:26.707
They did have phone numbers, but I never followed through on it.

54:26.787 --> 54:32.014
The best way to check that would be to get through Jim Casper, because they may well turn up with you.

54:32.455 --> 54:32.976
Yeah, whatever.

54:33.296 --> 54:41.348
But I didn't see it as a prudent... Well, again, we can copy stuff I can do before I even leave.

54:41.408 --> 54:44.112
Yeah, but...

54:45.222 --> 54:46.984
So you want copies of this too, right?

54:47.004 --> 54:48.446
No, I'll just take down the names now.

54:49.328 --> 54:51.551
But this is, by the way, the Institute of Traditional Science.

54:51.631 --> 54:54.034
Yeah, just, it's worth a punt.

54:54.775 --> 55:00.683
I bet that a lot of the names we don't know are contemporaries of Jim Casper.

55:00.703 --> 55:06.712
And since David Watkins isn't talking, and we're not going near Michael Davis, Jim Casper is the only link we have to that period.

55:06.732 --> 55:12.900
If I were working with you, I would just, if I were being asked for my advice on this, by the way,

55:15.327 --> 55:17.330
I would go, I would approach Michael Davis.

55:18.151 --> 55:18.891
At the end.

55:19.412 --> 55:22.436
Yeah, I'm going to approach him through, I mean, we need him.

55:22.456 --> 55:31.147
But after you get this thing put together, it's called a killer, you know, I mean, don't worry for the killer when you've got everything else set up.

55:31.167 --> 55:32.889
I'm fine for now, thank you, honestly.

55:32.909 --> 55:33.650
No, we're fine.

55:33.670 --> 55:34.691
Thank you very much.

55:34.711 --> 55:36.473
What's, Antoine?

55:36.493 --> 55:37.755
Yeah, I'm in the glass now.

55:37.775 --> 55:39.377
Hold on.

55:43.947 --> 55:45.990
Don't forget, this is a few years ago.

55:46.010 --> 55:47.572
Actually, not that long ago.

55:47.592 --> 55:47.893
Here you go.

55:50.176 --> 55:55.904
This is 1990, so it's 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

55:55.924 --> 55:56.144
Okay.

55:56.184 --> 55:59.108
This is the tax return.

55:59.128 --> 55:59.228
Yeah.

55:59.248 --> 56:01.712
The annual report of the history of the tradition.

56:01.732 --> 56:04.536
Love that.

56:04.556 --> 56:09.262
And here it is again, James Lowell.

56:09.282 --> 56:11.305
Again, this is also McConnell from that.

56:11.325 --> 56:13.228
This is another report where they show up.

56:13.900 --> 56:14.701
same names.

56:16.804 --> 56:19.588
James H. Lowell II of Westwood, Mass.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.454
Now Boone, you know.

56:23.474 --> 56:28.882
These are officers.

56:28.902 --> 56:30.564
This is the 89 annual report.

56:30.584 --> 56:33.789
This is the 90 annual report.

56:35.331 --> 56:43.603
This one here, which is 19—I see, but they're not on there, so they're officers.

56:47.667 --> 56:48.949
This is very early.

56:49.150 --> 56:51.453
Remember you asked me about the check?

56:51.474 --> 56:52.756
You definitely want a copy of that.

56:53.898 --> 56:55.300
That's how they paid for their fee.

56:55.440 --> 56:58.165
That's a copy of a check.

56:58.746 --> 56:59.207
What is it?

57:00.729 --> 57:02.032
To the traditional science.

57:02.532 --> 57:04.656
That's their check.

57:04.676 --> 57:05.317
What's this for?

57:05.337 --> 57:06.018
Twenty-five bucks.

57:06.038 --> 57:07.781
They paid their fee to the estate.

57:09.384 --> 57:11.087
They had the copy of the check there.

57:11.568 --> 57:12.490
I copied the check.

57:12.690 --> 57:13.371
It cost me a quarter.

57:16.625 --> 57:18.348
Just put it on that file.

57:18.388 --> 57:20.371
Just if you want a copy of the check, that's all.

57:23.255 --> 57:25.799
Here's my receipt.

57:25.819 --> 57:26.821
Secretary of State.

57:27.883 --> 57:30.787
Again, more into the traditional science.

57:32.190 --> 57:35.355
Which is the Secretary of the Attorney General's report.

57:36.436 --> 57:37.418
I got them for every year.

57:37.438 --> 57:38.700
I don't know what that means.

57:38.760 --> 57:42.666
It's just the annual report that you have to file if you are a non-profit agency.

57:43.507 --> 57:52.336
And what I'm looking for is—what I'm really looking for is one where they write out a check, a letter to the Sophie Davis Foundation.

57:52.376 --> 58:03.808
That's how I found out the letter to the Sophie Davis Foundation.

58:03.828 --> 58:06.731
You've got to read these things so damn carefully, you know?

58:08.372 --> 58:09.794
Now, go ahead.

58:09.814 --> 58:10.475
Any questions?

58:10.635 --> 58:10.915
Go ahead.

58:12.481 --> 58:20.548
So you've got the class concerns only up to 90.

58:20.608 --> 58:25.293
He has an unlisted number, but he has to publish his number in this ad.

58:25.453 --> 58:31.078
If you're, again, you have to print an ad in the paper that you are this non-profit organization.

58:31.098 --> 58:36.623
So I never, nobody could argue that I used a list of needs to get an unlisted number.

58:37.224 --> 58:38.505
Which number is it?

58:38.525 --> 58:39.906
It's his number.

58:39.926 --> 58:41.267
Yeah, of course it is.

58:41.327 --> 58:41.948
We'll call it right now.

58:42.316 --> 58:44.040
661-2708, yeah.

58:44.061 --> 58:50.578
All right, and you see, this is how we work.

58:50.598 --> 58:53.265
This is very, that's a letter to the Sophie Davis Foundation.

58:53.345 --> 58:55.009
That's from the Foundation Report.

58:59.697 --> 59:04.862
If, you know, as far as you know, I mean, is this... Oh, totally.

59:06.004 --> 59:07.385
Is Michael Davis involved?

59:07.786 --> 59:08.586
I showed you that.

59:08.707 --> 59:11.409
I mean, yeah, apart from, I mean, actively involved.

59:11.470 --> 59:12.471
He's an heir.

59:12.531 --> 59:14.313
He's one of the officers.

59:16.114 --> 59:18.517
That's where we got his address, from the Lennon.

59:18.577 --> 59:22.141
But this is also, we put in the foundation directory, it's called.

59:24.003 --> 59:24.203
All right.

59:27.642 --> 59:30.125
This is the last big file we have here.

59:30.205 --> 59:32.288
Again, this is another copy of the discharge.

59:34.170 --> 59:41.839
I did have another copy of the Judge Mason letter, but I thought I didn't.

59:41.859 --> 59:47.286
As you can see, numerous multiple copies of this thing.

59:47.306 --> 59:49.208
What's the structure that became what it was?

59:49.949 --> 59:52.232
Oh, you absolutely have to have this.

59:54.710 --> 59:58.094
There's a little document overlay there.

59:58.114 --> 01:00:00.696
No, that's the mother of love.

01:00:00.777 --> 01:00:04.581
That's the document.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.503
If you don't take that, then you're wasting your time.

01:00:08.545 --> 01:00:10.847
That's the second most important document next to me.

01:00:11.388 --> 01:00:14.251
Well, you also have the power of attorney that makes this possible.

01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:20.818
This is where Michael agrees to give him everything in perpetuity, and he waives his right to ever sign his name.

01:00:21.153 --> 01:00:22.174
It's everything.

01:00:22.194 --> 01:00:27.639
And this is the thing, this is the document that is recorded out in Millerton, New York.

01:00:28.399 --> 01:00:29.981
Now, did I give you the power of attorney?

01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:33.003
I think it's in the list.

01:00:33.564 --> 01:00:34.985
This is the whole set.

01:00:35.005 --> 01:00:41.030
This is the certificate of limited partnership.

01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:45.694
What does it say on page two?

01:00:45.794 --> 01:00:48.156
You might just be able to keep that.

01:00:48.196 --> 01:00:50.198
Series 0.5.

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:54.354
We also want the amendment to the certificate of limited time.

01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:55.715
Let's look at what this amendment does.

01:00:56.095 --> 01:00:58.418
Is that when more money is getting published?

01:00:58.438 --> 01:00:58.998
Yeah.

01:00:59.018 --> 01:01:01.561
See, and these are the ads that they had to publish.

01:01:01.621 --> 01:01:03.883
And it's that in the Poughkeepsie Journal.

01:01:03.903 --> 01:01:04.904
Yeah.

01:01:04.924 --> 01:01:05.625
Okay.

01:01:05.645 --> 01:01:18.497
So this makes me... Look at this.

01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:27.766
He had, I mean, is there a formal spring between him and Davis prior to the establishment of the government limited that it may be?

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:29.208
You want it in this regard?

01:01:29.548 --> 01:01:31.410
No, the words of the Dolphin Realty Trust.

01:01:32.171 --> 01:01:41.200
Okay, so the books prior to the establishment of the government limited in 1983 were brought through the Dolphin Realty Trust with Michael Davis.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:48.147
At this particular point in 1983, Michael has now been around him for eight or nine years.

01:01:48.953 --> 01:01:52.516
At this point, he's either totally mind-controlled or drugged.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.538
I'm not making this up.

01:01:54.558 --> 01:01:58.862
At this point, he's signing over his life to this guy and all of his money.

01:01:59.623 --> 01:02:04.387
And it is at this point that the big buying in the Garden Limited starts.

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:12.075
Now Haven can do anything he wants without even dealing with it.

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:16.699
He's got drugged and living in an apartment next door.

01:02:17.438 --> 01:02:21.783
keeping him alive, probably.

01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:23.045
Think what you want.

01:02:23.205 --> 01:02:26.910
I believe that.

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:29.333
What I want to do is get something clear.

01:02:29.353 --> 01:02:31.836
That's why these files are remounted.

01:02:31.996 --> 01:02:40.687
Do you think that Davis was a drug addict of his own volition, or do you think he was kept drugged by Omar?

01:02:40.767 --> 01:02:42.029
It's an important distinction.

01:02:42.089 --> 01:02:43.871
I think he was kept drugged by Omar.

01:02:44.832 --> 01:02:47.175
I think that he was either influenced if you read,

01:02:49.214 --> 01:02:51.557
We got a letter here from Haven's lawyer.

01:02:51.917 --> 01:02:52.718
It's fantastic.

01:02:52.838 --> 01:02:53.499
It's unbelievable.

01:02:53.519 --> 01:03:00.508
It's when they were going to, they wanted, they were threatening, they wanted $15 million from me and my publisher.

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:09.519
And they went through the whole chapter, and they were quoting this person saying, these are damaging words about Haven.

01:03:09.579 --> 01:03:13.123
None of it was, everything, I was quoting people accurately, but Haven said this in the library.

01:03:13.464 --> 01:03:17.989
The one statement they never, never, never,

01:03:18.813 --> 01:03:19.193
Never.

01:03:19.874 --> 01:03:20.755
You have both mentioned.

01:03:20.815 --> 01:03:21.976
I'll just keep a copy of the book.

01:03:22.557 --> 01:03:27.562
There's the one where I am driving in the car with Bob Nightcourt, who is dead.

01:03:28.843 --> 01:03:36.131
And Bob says... And this is the thing.

01:03:36.171 --> 01:03:37.893
This is the one that scared me the most.

01:03:38.153 --> 01:03:40.015
It was hearsay.

01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:43.018
This is the one statement that's not based on anything.

01:03:43.078 --> 01:03:44.140
And it's a guy who's dead.

01:03:45.441 --> 01:03:46.382
But I knew it was true.

01:03:46.402 --> 01:03:47.503
That's why I put it in the book.

01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:49.306
I knew it was true.

01:03:51.408 --> 01:04:02.440
Come on, where's the Nykirk?

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:02.700
Oh, come on.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.781
I'm sorry, I don't know where we go.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.622
All right, here we go.

01:04:04.642 --> 01:04:05.182
Here we go.

01:04:05.202 --> 01:04:05.583
I'll read it.

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:11.409
The morning of the sale, November 9th, 1989, the late Robert L. Nykirk, librarian of the Grolier Club.

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:12.910
He's dead now.

01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:14.692
He died of AIDS, in fact.

01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:17.395
And I took a cab to Southerby's, and that's relevant.

01:04:17.415 --> 01:04:18.216
It's not just a piece.

01:04:18.398 --> 01:04:22.743
His lover was a guy at self-abuse.

01:04:22.763 --> 01:04:23.564
This is between us.

01:04:23.664 --> 01:04:23.924
Yeah.

01:04:24.845 --> 01:04:28.329
Which is why what I'm about to read to you is not just hearsay.

01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:38.039
Bob Nightkirk, his lover, was a major, I don't know what he did at self-abuse, but he was a big deal at self-abuse, which handled the sale.

01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:43.225
And I took the cab to self-abuse for a look at the books to be sold that night.

01:04:43.812 --> 01:04:48.658
As we move through heavy east side traffic, Nykerk speculated about the garden collection.

01:04:48.738 --> 01:04:54.045
He, by the way, would not allow me to record, but I took notes furiously.

01:04:54.065 --> 01:04:56.688
There's something very fishy about this sale, he said.

01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:01.514
What everyone is hearing is that Mr. Davis paid the bills, but he never saw the books.

01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:06.301
Mr. Davis paid out millions of dollars, and he was never allowed to see his own books.

01:05:07.162 --> 01:05:09.144
How this happened, nobody seems to know.

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:11.567
But what I hear is that he was beguiled.

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:13.009
All right?

01:05:13.394 --> 01:05:14.736
I think I've heard of him.

01:05:14.756 --> 01:05:15.357
Yeah, you have.

01:05:15.477 --> 01:05:19.202
I understand where Night Kirk is coming from right now.

01:05:19.763 --> 01:05:22.767
I mean, ask who Bob Night Kirk's companion was.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:25.371
You'll find out that it was a guy itself at least.

01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:33.562
What he hears, have you read what Mr. O'Moore says in the catalog, that all these books were going into his cosmic library?

01:05:33.622 --> 01:05:35.925
Remember we were talking about heaven and stuff?

01:05:36.045 --> 01:05:40.752
The man obviously is a nut, but people who are crazy, and they did pick up on that quote,

01:05:41.018 --> 01:05:43.442
But people who are crazy can also be very bright.

01:05:43.462 --> 01:05:46.847
And nobody denies that this man or more has a feeling for books.

01:05:46.867 --> 01:05:47.708
But what was it?

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:49.751
Something religious?

01:05:50.232 --> 01:05:50.913
Hypnotism?

01:05:51.394 --> 01:05:52.195
Brainwashing?

01:05:52.595 --> 01:05:53.777
Too many diet pills?

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.602
He never questioned this.

01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:57.823
Haven never questioned this.

01:05:58.044 --> 01:05:58.524
You know why?

01:05:58.565 --> 01:06:00.207
Because this is on the money.

01:06:00.527 --> 01:06:01.569
This is on the money.

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:02.751
This is what it was.

01:06:02.991 --> 01:06:03.873
Where's the original, Mac?

01:06:05.455 --> 01:06:06.316
Thanks.

01:06:06.537 --> 01:06:06.737
Okay.

01:06:06.757 --> 01:06:06.857
Okay.

01:06:07.343 --> 01:06:10.747
These are the things people are asking, and they are quite serious.

01:06:10.847 --> 01:06:13.250
Nobody knows except Sotheby's.

01:06:14.592 --> 01:06:15.994
And they're not talking to anyone.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.796
It's unique in the history of book collecting.

01:06:17.816 --> 01:06:20.780
Well, I'll show you the letter from them.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.803
You think they ever questioned that?

01:06:23.924 --> 01:06:26.987
That I repeated these scurrilous rulers?

01:06:28.389 --> 01:06:30.111
They wouldn't question it because they were true.

01:06:30.131 --> 01:06:30.752
That's why.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.958
That's why they didn't challenge me on that, because that is what is in that file.

01:06:35.439 --> 01:06:36.000
How do I know?

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:36.460
I don't know.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.401
Let's go and steal it.

01:06:38.523 --> 01:06:39.384
All right, next question.

01:06:40.725 --> 01:06:41.426
Let me go through.

01:06:41.446 --> 01:06:44.289
I understand who Bob Nightkirk is.

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:46.992
Bob Nightkirk, they've been at the Closure Club on the River.

01:06:47.032 --> 01:06:50.316
That's like the Roxburgh Club when it's here.

01:06:50.576 --> 01:06:52.819
That's our version of your Roxburgh Club.

01:06:52.859 --> 01:06:57.344
It's a very fancy club of bibliophiles.

01:06:57.364 --> 01:06:58.866
When you come here sometime, I'll bring you there.

01:07:00.263 --> 01:07:01.644
We were in New York.

01:07:03.066 --> 01:07:05.648
Bob was the librarian and director for twenty years.

01:07:06.228 --> 01:07:08.490
His companion was a guy in self-abuse.

01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:13.895
He was telling me there was coming straight from self-abuse.

01:07:13.915 --> 01:07:17.479
And we were going in the cab, we were going in the taxi over the day of the sale.

01:07:17.519 --> 01:07:20.281
Half an hour later, as well, I'm confronted by Haver and Omar.

01:07:20.301 --> 01:07:22.263
This is the talk that's going on.

01:07:22.383 --> 01:07:23.704
Where the hell is this guy, Omar?

01:07:23.724 --> 01:07:24.505
What's going on?

01:07:25.306 --> 01:07:27.828
And the thing is, the people in self-abuse knew the whole story.

01:07:27.848 --> 01:07:29.089
They had to know.

01:07:29.609 --> 01:07:33.594
That's another place you ain't going to get any help, isn't it?

01:07:33.714 --> 01:07:38.401
You're not, but... I thought that was my riskiest paragraph on the whole chapter.

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:42.606
Well, you can see, I've annotated it.

01:07:42.646 --> 01:07:45.470
Underline the guile, because the guile sounds like a euphemism.

01:07:46.151 --> 01:07:48.674
That's what Bob was saying.

01:07:48.794 --> 01:07:55.103
I felt I was taking my greatest risk with that paragraph because I am dealing in speculation here.

01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:56.104
Hearsay.

01:07:57.326 --> 01:07:58.367
And I said, the hell with it.

01:07:59.191 --> 01:08:00.352
That's what the guy said.

01:08:00.553 --> 01:08:01.674
I'm confident in the quotes.

01:08:02.014 --> 01:08:03.476
I'll tell you now.

01:08:04.377 --> 01:08:07.862
Let me tell you something else now.

01:08:08.422 --> 01:08:13.869
When Nightcourt gave me the quotes, I was not supposed to use his name.

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.291
I was supposed to be an end name source.

01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:16.372
But then he died.

01:08:16.452 --> 01:08:19.916
But then he died, and I said, screw it, I'm using his name.

01:08:19.976 --> 01:08:22.219
My words no longer apply to a dead man.

01:08:22.239 --> 01:08:28.827
Now, I don't want to be embarrassed by this, but I'm telling you

01:08:29.212 --> 01:08:31.455
how strongly I felt about that quote.

01:08:33.699 --> 01:08:47.299
I don't want to go on record as saying I never betray my word, but I also felt that I had a dead man here.

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:54.610
And I also felt that if I put that in there without an attribution, I weakened my position drastically.

01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:58.476
And because the man was dead, I attributed it to him, and I had not heard a peep.

01:08:58.827 --> 01:09:05.396
a peep from anyone questioning it, from anywhere, because it's on the money.

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:11.023
So let's get to the nugget of the reason that the case was encountered.

01:09:11.724 --> 01:09:25.182
You think the thing that the Davises are most concerned does not get out is just a fact that their son was acting under the inducement of drugs.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:28.547
Would you like it known that your kid went to Harvard?

01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:56.830
dropped out uh became brainwashed probably engaged in homosexual uh activities with the person which is what i you know that that that used drugs that was brainwashed it turned over his fortune and it had to be it had to be rescued by a by a squadron of pinkerton but there is a difference there is a difference between um taking drugs in the youth having a joint having a drop in acid well in the early 70s whatever and being drugged

01:09:58.885 --> 01:10:09.219
Well, now you're asking me to speculate what's in the records, and I can only speculate on what I think.

01:10:09.419 --> 01:10:12.203
That's why public records should be public.

01:10:12.223 --> 01:10:15.628
That's why we should be able to go in there and see what's in there.

01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:18.071
Why should we be guessing about this?

01:10:18.592 --> 01:10:19.814
This is not a private matter.

01:10:19.834 --> 01:10:26.363
The minute you go into a courtroom in this country, it is a matter of public records, whether you like it or not.

01:10:26.743 --> 01:10:28.065
As soon as you ask the court's

01:10:30.205 --> 01:10:34.150
to adjudicate a case, and you know, they ask for a jury trial.

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:35.231
That's a jury of your peers.

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:35.972
That's the public.

01:10:36.793 --> 01:10:37.114
You know.

01:10:38.295 --> 01:10:40.438
Can we pull so I can change batteries and types?

01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:41.780
Do you need to do that?

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:42.541
How am I?

01:10:42.821 --> 01:10:44.283
It just returns itself.

01:10:44.303 --> 01:10:44.964
It's still going.

01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:57.259
I'm just checking as I've gone through the chapter in the book, but there's nothing I need to.

01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:01.918
You got Goulton's book, by the way?

01:11:02.299 --> 01:11:02.599
No.

01:11:02.619 --> 01:11:03.841
Did you?

01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:08.067
No.

01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:08.968
Did he tell you anything?

01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:13.214
I haven't read it yet.

01:11:13.234 --> 01:11:14.095
It's his backup.

01:11:14.115 --> 01:11:14.676
Yeah.

01:11:14.736 --> 01:11:21.385
If you don't mind, I'm going to copy the title page on this, that's all.

01:11:21.405 --> 01:11:21.546
Yep.

01:11:21.566 --> 01:11:21.906
Ninety-eight.

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:26.312
Did he do anything in here about mind control?

01:11:28.255 --> 01:11:29.357
Yeah, the brain works.

01:11:29.597 --> 01:11:30.418
Yeah, I'm looking.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:46.729
Mind control or mind control?

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:59.404
Media, media, marketing.

01:11:59.424 --> 01:12:00.726
How about deprogramming?

01:12:07.979 --> 01:12:09.541
Well, I would certainly make note of this.

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:10.282
I wish to help.

01:12:10.422 --> 01:12:11.423
But this book is 98.

01:12:11.443 --> 01:12:13.326
Yeah, that's good.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.292
That's got the one.

01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:21.777
Yeah, I just put all I want to do is copy that target.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.323
How are we doing?

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:30.769
Yeah, you can have that as a copy of some copies.

01:12:30.789 --> 01:12:34.614
Hold on.

01:12:34.634 --> 01:12:35.034
Good.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:37.277
I'm just looking through stuff now.

01:12:39.299 --> 01:12:40.320
Any questions?

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.941
No.

01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:43.503
I mean, the questions would all arise.

01:12:43.623 --> 01:12:44.564
All right, here's a copy.

01:12:44.724 --> 01:12:46.946
This is just a moratorium in Frederick.

01:12:47.006 --> 01:12:49.528
We tried to assimilate this, so the questions would come by.

01:12:49.548 --> 01:12:54.152
This is the, you know, this is all to stop him from building the Institute of Traditional Science.

01:12:54.252 --> 01:12:55.974
Oh, is this Albion soil?

01:12:55.994 --> 01:12:56.874
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:12:57.094 --> 01:12:58.416
And you have this?

01:12:59.597 --> 01:13:00.958
That's the position.

01:13:01.218 --> 01:13:02.799
Albion's the guy that could get to talk.

01:13:02.819 --> 01:13:03.520
Did he sit around?

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:03.860
Yeah.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.402
Well, he doesn't know anything.

01:13:05.802 --> 01:13:09.085
He thought he was from Harvard, you know, there's not much.

01:13:09.105 --> 01:13:09.205
Yeah.

01:13:12.796 --> 01:13:38.905
card yeah this is i copied everything i don't think there's anything that you need if you want it you're certainly welcome to copy it all right so this is all basically stuff that would be if you're interested we can go through some of them later uh it's the individual yeah they're individual parcels the major instrument is the dolphin realty trust which but we have a bit

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.794
Okay, and then I'll... We're making a couple of stuff, which is useful.

01:13:46.814 --> 01:13:58.189
I mean, it's interesting because he's got lots of people that you may not have... Is there anything in particular, anything else that you... No, I mean, you know, what I really want to do is get my... because all this is new.

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:06.540
So I had no intelligent questions to ask until, or even stupify, until I've... Simulated it, right?

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.384
Right.

01:14:09.624 --> 01:14:11.647
I can't read this definition.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:12.428
That's wonderful.

01:14:12.688 --> 01:14:13.549
That's really...

01:14:14.137 --> 01:14:17.100
And Nicole, I think, did do you the entire case, right?

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.401
Yeah.

01:14:18.441 --> 01:14:21.525
That's fantastic.

01:14:21.545 --> 01:14:23.987
Again, we've been through all the Antoine things.

01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:28.932
This is all replication of stuff that we have.

01:14:28.952 --> 01:14:31.315
Institute of Traditional Asylum.

01:14:31.455 --> 01:14:33.397
Filing fee.

01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:34.238
That's nothing.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.141
I can't find it.

01:14:37.762 --> 01:14:40.144
There are some other things here.

01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:47.690
This is all stuff that we've been through.

01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:49.473
I have a whole file of things here.

01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:51.957
This file right here.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.945
Materials that I received subsequent to the publication of the book.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:08.123
In 1996, while I was out at the California Book Fair, which we just came from, we received a letter

01:15:09.419 --> 01:15:15.067
If you get a copy of this, the final answer to my freedom of the information, you have to have this, because that is the document.

01:15:15.087 --> 01:15:17.670
That's the salient document telling me that Ava no more.

01:15:18.151 --> 01:15:20.574
Yeah, that's the letter from the general.

01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:22.657
You have to have that.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:26.843
But they were going to sue me for $15 million.

01:15:28.165 --> 01:15:29.146
I had libel to him.

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:30.067
I got everything wrong.

01:15:31.269 --> 01:15:34.133
Yeah, we went through this.

01:15:34.894 --> 01:15:37.958
I hope I wasn't giving you something like...

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:42.255
a bit of coffee, but I've got to keep that.

01:15:42.275 --> 01:15:49.446
These are all property transactions, sir.

01:15:49.526 --> 01:16:04.186
I think I've already touched on this a little bit, that I was, had I not had that case in Kansas, and I would have been really very anxious about what was going on.

01:16:04.206 --> 01:16:06.730
These are all property transactions.

01:16:07.823 --> 01:16:12.310
But where the hell is the document?

01:16:13.892 --> 01:16:15.514
Is this part of the document?

01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:20.421
No mention of it.

01:16:20.662 --> 01:16:21.022
Of which?

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.987
The 44 induction.

01:16:24.728 --> 01:16:25.609
That's right.

01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:26.330
That's from the government.

01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:27.131
That's from the U.S.

01:16:27.171 --> 01:16:27.532
government.

01:16:28.814 --> 01:16:30.797
That is a document from the U.S.

01:16:30.857 --> 01:16:31.097
government.

01:16:31.904 --> 01:16:34.667
I mean, come on.

01:16:34.727 --> 01:16:38.590
Listen, although you know that yes or no, they have to listen.

01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:43.155
They have to listen and to get what information you would volunteer.

01:16:43.555 --> 01:16:48.900
All of which would be useful, whether it's true or, you know, whether it's possibly not.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.584
The fact was that I needed to use confidence.

01:16:53.644 --> 01:17:00.831
In this particular file, which we haven't been through yet, I mean, I'm happy to let you look at some of this stuff, but...

01:17:02.228 --> 01:17:08.576
this is material that I received while they were threatening me to this libel post.

01:17:08.596 --> 01:17:16.106
And, of course, while our lawyer was dealing with their lawyer, here's a letter from them.

01:17:16.126 --> 01:17:18.089
These are the things that he finds wrong with the book.

01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:26.600
And they're all, you know, the next, this is all wrong, a libelist per se, false and definitively statements, gravely in Jerome Moore's reputation in business.

01:17:27.181 --> 01:17:29.924
They've caused him severe violence, but they never did anything.

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:31.847
I mean, they threatened to assume that they never did anything.

01:17:32.165 --> 01:17:34.208
My feeling is, if I lie, will you sue me?

01:17:34.588 --> 01:17:36.251
If you believe I lie, will you sue me?

01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:37.593
Let's have it out in court.

01:17:37.713 --> 01:17:39.796
Let's go do it."

01:17:39.816 --> 01:17:41.638
They backed away.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:45.904
They backed away because they tried to—this is what he claimed as the factual background.

01:17:47.807 --> 01:17:49.068
He completed high school.

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:51.271
He went to the Army.

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:52.854
This is what he probably told me yesterday.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:55.878
I'll let you copy this.

01:17:55.898 --> 01:17:56.879
I'll let you copy this.

01:17:56.899 --> 01:17:59.623
I'm not under any obligation.

01:18:05.611 --> 01:18:09.077
I will let him come.

01:18:09.097 --> 01:18:10.139
Now I have stuff here.

01:18:12.323 --> 01:18:18.515
This is a thing, Combat Actions in Korea.

01:18:18.675 --> 01:18:21.019
He sent this one.

01:18:21.039 --> 01:18:22.742
This is a letter from Haven to his lawyer.

01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:28.513
This supposedly describes his combat experiences.

01:18:29.168 --> 01:18:31.911
So Haven gave it to his lawyer, who gave it to our lawyer.

01:18:32.192 --> 01:18:34.354
Yeah, that's right.

01:18:34.374 --> 01:18:37.117
Well, because they were trying to say he served in the Army.

01:18:37.137 --> 01:18:41.102
His Army service was very, very important to him.

01:18:41.743 --> 01:18:46.728
And so in this edition of the book, I took out all mentions of the Army service.

01:18:46.748 --> 01:18:47.089
I did.

01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:54.457
Not because I believe they were wrong, because I do believe that with this information, they were incomplete.

01:18:54.477 --> 01:18:56.920
I now believe that he did serve a second tour of duty.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.382
I didn't know that when I wrote the book.

01:18:59.307 --> 01:19:01.269
because I didn't know he had a third name.

01:19:01.889 --> 01:19:03.351
I didn't know he was Richard H. Moore.

01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:12.980
Had I known he was Richard H. Moore, and then he went in under another number, not his Social Security number, he went in under another number, not his Social Security number.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.062
I mean, it was a direct deception.

01:19:15.142 --> 01:19:15.963
It follows through.

01:19:17.284 --> 01:19:19.406
That's why they couldn't find the paperwork for me.

01:19:19.426 --> 01:19:22.068
That file there came after we knew who Richard H. Moore was.

01:19:22.128 --> 01:19:24.170
Now they put the two together for me.

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:24.851
You know what I'm saying?

01:19:26.192 --> 01:19:26.933
Is that difficult?

01:19:26.953 --> 01:19:29.095
Or maybe it's, uh, no, I understand.

01:19:30.053 --> 01:19:31.537
Uh, yes.

01:19:34.324 --> 01:19:36.790
Service history.

01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:37.472
Oh, I'm off?

01:19:39.918 --> 01:19:40.840
Well, okay, cool.
