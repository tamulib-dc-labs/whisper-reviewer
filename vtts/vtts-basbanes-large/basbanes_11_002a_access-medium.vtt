WEBVTT

00:04.199 --> 00:06.182
They're rolling.

00:06.823 --> 00:10.729
Let's hope I can pick this up around the back race.

00:11.931 --> 00:14.635
I'm curious, you're a senior.

00:14.735 --> 00:16.057
You have Christine.

00:16.618 --> 00:19.382
Christine, you said you're from Texas, is that right?

00:19.402 --> 00:19.723
Where in Texas?

00:19.763 --> 00:20.704
San Enzo.

00:20.724 --> 00:21.145
San Enzo.

00:22.238 --> 00:26.322
Which way did you apply to St.

00:26.482 --> 00:27.964
John?

00:27.984 --> 00:47.663
I had been to another college in Virginia for a few years off and on, and I really didn't take to the kind of education.

00:47.863 --> 00:49.886
I just didn't learn well in that kind of a setting.

00:49.906 --> 00:50.406
Was it liberalized?

00:50.386 --> 00:57.409
I was reading literature mainly, but I didn't know.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.142
Yeah, the focus was completely different.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.764
You know, you had to declare a major.

01:02.844 --> 01:08.188
And the sort of teaching was, it was not, you know, it was traditional.

01:09.089 --> 01:13.133
You go to class, you listen to a lecture, you take notes, and then you take a test.

01:13.153 --> 01:14.694
And I didn't learn well in that way.

01:14.754 --> 01:16.636
And so I quit school.

01:16.676 --> 01:20.339
I mean, I decided I didn't need a degree for anything.

01:20.459 --> 01:21.681
I wasn't going for that.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.522
It was more about education.

01:23.542 --> 01:28.847
So I stopped going to school, and I just decided I would read for the rest of my life.

01:28.827 --> 01:36.335
So when I ended up moving to Annapolis, and I heard about St.

01:37.396 --> 01:46.907
John's, it sounded to me like they were doing just what I had planned to do, and that's why I hide.

01:47.287 --> 01:49.129
I didn't want to stop educating myself.

01:49.229 --> 01:54.295
I knew that I would never stop doing that, but I didn't see any need to get a degree.

01:54.275 --> 02:07.076
because that wasn't the point.

02:07.096 --> 02:10.642
And so, learning was the sort of point.

02:10.662 --> 02:11.864
That's why I thought this would be the place to do it.

02:11.884 --> 02:12.445
And it turned out, you know.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.369
When you're thinking about reading for the rest of your life, you know, I think about my books.

02:14.389 --> 02:15.270
Instead of an academic book, that comes out.

02:15.807 --> 02:21.154
I didn't know.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.596
I really didn't know.

02:22.676 --> 02:26.821
At this point, I've decided I want to go to medical school.

02:26.901 --> 02:30.386
And I decided that right before I came back to St.

02:30.486 --> 02:31.087
John's.

02:31.968 --> 02:35.973
I knew I wanted to go back to school somewhere.

02:36.113 --> 02:39.097
So I didn't have a point before.

02:39.437 --> 02:42.321
I just thought, and really, literally, I mean, the book,

02:42.301 --> 02:44.265
The book took me where I wanted to go.

02:44.285 --> 02:45.248
I started reading.

02:45.869 --> 02:50.760
I read War and Peace.

02:52.264 --> 03:00.462
I read War and Peace as one of the first literature books that I ever read.

03:00.442 --> 03:02.806
I mean, it sort of changed my life.

03:02.967 --> 03:11.202
Like, I... Well, how is it that Tolstoy helped you decide that you want to go to marriage?

03:11.663 --> 03:12.424
Well, I'll just tell you.

03:12.444 --> 03:18.315
I mean, I... It was kind of personal, but at the end of the book, I sort of...

03:18.295 --> 03:24.021
I remember, not the epilogue, you know, the end of a novel.

03:24.122 --> 03:30.369
I remember I just sort of burst into tears because it was over, because it had been such a big part of my life up until then.

03:30.409 --> 03:42.202
I mean, all I'd wanted to do was read, and I was working at the time, and, you know, I would work, and I would think, oh, I wonder what's going to happen next time I pick up the book.

03:42.222 --> 03:47.408
So when it was over, I really, like, it's just sort of, that book, you know,

03:47.877 --> 03:51.942
I just wanted to read everything I could find by him.

03:52.243 --> 03:58.631
It was like I met a new friend and then I went and found everything I could find by Tolstoy and read it.

04:00.133 --> 04:08.164
To me, that's very connected to what I want to do.

04:08.752 --> 04:09.793
connecting with people.

04:09.893 --> 04:20.185
I felt like the characters in the novel were so real that I made friends with them.

04:20.205 --> 04:30.317
I don't know how to really connect it, but I started reading Grey's Anatomy because I wanted to learn about anatomy.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.700
That was because of a different book that I read.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.725
Which book was that?

04:35.925 --> 04:39.010
It was at the Spider House School.

04:39.591 --> 04:46.682
Yeah, you know, that story about the boy who learned medicine through Grey's Anatomy and apprenticeship.

04:46.702 --> 04:56.637
And so that sort of, I mean, that story inspired me to... If you don't mind me asking, Kristen, how old are you?

04:56.897 --> 04:57.338
I'm 29.

04:57.959 --> 05:01.707
Yeah, I was 26 when I came back, when I started St.

05:01.887 --> 05:02.529
Johnson.

05:02.589 --> 05:06.237
I'll be 30 very shortly after I guys came.

05:07.078 --> 05:08.662
I've been accepted to one medical school.

05:08.682 --> 05:10.025
It's a foreign medical school.

05:10.165 --> 05:11.428
I'm not sure I'll go there.

05:11.588 --> 05:13.572
Which is it?

05:13.552 --> 05:16.919
It's in Cambridge, England.

05:16.939 --> 05:18.883
It's not a Cambridge college.

05:18.903 --> 05:23.031
It's actually a Ugandan medical school that's set up in Cambridge.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.574
Yeah, it's an exchange.

05:24.614 --> 05:28.422
The idea is to get a medical school.

05:28.807 --> 05:44.048
So I don't know that I'll go there, but right now I'm looking into doing close back work.

05:44.028 --> 05:59.503
doing post-bacc pre-med, because we don't get the technical sciences here, so I have to do a year of post-bacc pre-medical preparation before I can take the MCAT and then go... You haven't applied any American medical school.

05:59.563 --> 05:59.963
Not yet.

05:59.983 --> 06:01.384
I have to take the MCAT.

06:01.485 --> 06:11.554
You don't know how they respond to this kind of... Well, yeah, I mean, I can't really... I haven't taken the MCAT yet, and I mean, what will...

06:11.534 --> 06:18.861
to prove whether or not this kind of education is useful or not is how I do on the test.

06:19.381 --> 06:33.284
If my scores show that I've learned something here, then I'm sure that this relationship will just be a plus.

06:33.304 --> 06:36.249
But I don't know that yet.

06:38.332 --> 06:45.204
And I do have to take organic chemistry and biology.

06:45.224 --> 06:45.945
I want to say your name on this guy.

06:45.925 --> 06:56.491
I know that there's someone who graduated a couple of years ago who's now at Columbia Medical School.

06:56.511 --> 07:00.200
I think our program is accepted, and I think a lot of medical schools are looking for local arts graduates.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.466
There is the ethical side of medicine that a lot of people

07:02.446 --> 07:20.640
I met a graduate who was in his third year of medical school there, and then there's an MD, PhD candidate who just came and gave a lecture here and graduated in 1991.

07:20.620 --> 07:23.163
He's at Georgetown.

07:23.304 --> 07:26.648
So lots of students go on there.

07:26.868 --> 07:31.094
And you said when we were standing in the line that you took a year off, is that right?

07:31.114 --> 07:32.556
I didn't take a year off.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.359
I took all of my years off before I came.

07:34.539 --> 07:35.680
And I had plenty.

07:36.562 --> 07:39.986
And what was the school in Virginia that it looked like?

07:40.006 --> 07:40.587
George Mason University.

07:41.512 --> 07:43.355
And what were you studying there?

07:43.375 --> 07:51.587
I was reading, I mean, I had declared the major of English.

07:51.707 --> 07:54.652
And I think I changed it at one point to philosophy.

07:54.672 --> 07:56.915
So this has been great for you?

07:56.955 --> 07:58.397
This is what you wanted?

07:58.417 --> 07:58.778
Yeah, I mean, I...

07:58.758 --> 08:06.049
I totally believe in the way we do things here.

08:08.372 --> 08:17.245
I mean, I've learned how to learn, and I've learned how I learn better.

08:17.265 --> 08:21.311
Yeah, I mean, I've found everything I needed to sort of go on to the next step.

08:21.331 --> 08:25.677
I don't know that I would have felt myself capable of going on to learn the really hard things that I have to learn for medical school if I hadn't had this kind of exposure to

08:25.657 --> 08:32.066
a really difficult new book every week that I've had to take on.

08:32.187 --> 08:33.589
It makes one brave to do that.

08:33.609 --> 08:37.414
Have these books inspired you to read other books?

08:37.434 --> 08:39.637
Were there any books?

08:39.657 --> 08:40.779
That's the idea, right?

08:40.799 --> 08:43.603
It's not just 120 books over four years.

08:43.623 --> 08:43.904
Oh, of course.

08:43.924 --> 08:51.334
There are conversations between the books and between people that have a desire to read other books.

08:51.975 --> 08:52.656
There's a lot of that.

08:52.676 --> 08:55.140
I'm sorry, that's good.

08:55.694 --> 09:06.874
So you're a junior, you took a year off, you said, when was that?

09:08.036 --> 09:12.364
And what did you do for that?

09:12.384 --> 09:14.007
Was it in your mind a continuation of your studies?

09:13.987 --> 09:28.748
I read them before I came here.

09:28.768 --> 09:29.650
That's part of the reason I started reading.

09:29.630 --> 09:49.159
I realized there were so many references that I didn't understand, and I felt like I needed stronger background.

09:49.179 --> 09:50.521
I needed to understand that he was making a reference to Rousseau.

09:50.541 --> 09:51.162
I needed to have read Rousseau.

09:51.182 --> 09:51.903
I needed to make love for the Bible.

09:51.923 --> 09:52.785
I read part of the Bible.

09:52.805 --> 09:54.287
It happens if I had never read the Bible like we do at the same time.

09:54.267 --> 10:22.452
you're from philadelphia so how did you hear about this this school um well for christine it was serendipitous it happened to move you on the other hand i just want to make sure we're doing fine we are and i was working there as a busboy and there was a

10:22.432 --> 10:46.410
I was looking for something that could help me understand Dostoevsky specifically, but more modern books in general.

10:46.530 --> 10:48.413
Do you have majors here?

10:48.433 --> 10:49.755
Describe to me, anyway.

10:50.748 --> 10:56.513
It's a specific course of study that everyone takes, right?

10:56.773 --> 10:58.935
No majors?

10:58.955 --> 11:00.056
Right.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.738
There are no majors.

11:02.098 --> 11:06.081
We do things roughly chronologically.

11:06.101 --> 11:13.048
We start out with Homer and go on to read Plato and Aristotle.

11:13.708 --> 11:20.434
And then in our freshman year we have a laboratory and we start with Aristotle.

11:20.414 --> 11:36.951
Then we read Harvey and study biology, physics, and chemistry.

11:36.971 --> 11:37.292
We study Euclid.

11:37.272 --> 11:43.624
It's sort of like a textbook for ancient Greek.

11:44.546 --> 11:45.227
It's not ancient Greek.

11:45.307 --> 11:50.657
It's really our only textbook is the ancient Greek manual.

11:51.160 --> 12:00.569
That helps us with translating things.

12:00.589 --> 12:09.237
But we do a lot of translating right away so that... Translating?

12:09.257 --> 12:09.397
Mm-hmm.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.559
So that... Where do you learn to do it?

12:11.579 --> 12:12.880
We do learn through textbooks.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.063
You know, we learn the alphabet, and then we learn to grab our... through this one textbook.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.245
But it's just, I mean, the same thing applies that the books are teaching us.

12:18.265 --> 12:19.106
We're learning from the language.

12:19.126 --> 12:20.087
When you describe the program, I mean, it says,

12:20.067 --> 12:33.007
It's a four-year program, history of Western intellectual thought.

12:33.027 --> 12:46.328
So you've got, if you were to think about it in other schools, you'd have like a double major of philosophy and history of mathematics and science, and a minor

12:46.645 --> 12:58.945
in comparative literature, and that takes into account the languages we study, and music.

12:58.965 --> 13:06.477
The idea being that nowadays

13:07.013 --> 13:20.335
Academia is so specific that everyone is trained to do a certain, I mean, they're very apt and, I don't know, technically excellent at whatever field that they're doing, but it's extremely narrow.

13:20.415 --> 13:33.477
In other words, at the time of Leonardo da Vinci and Goethe, there was an idea that you could, it's not master every fact that exists, have a general knowledge of every type of learning and art.

13:33.895 --> 13:34.857
that were known to man.

13:35.258 --> 13:39.767
Now that idea is totally abandoned by most people, and we're still preserving it to some degree.

13:39.807 --> 13:54.756
In other words, although we're not studying every discipline, obviously, we're not studying sociology, you know, psychology, anthropology, we're laying a foundation for which to understand the discipline you choose to go into.

13:55.107 --> 14:02.355
If you do choose to go into psychology, you understand the history of the traditions that Freud and Jung and Adler were working with.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.376
Same with sociology.

14:03.396 --> 14:07.921
You understand where Durkheim came from when he said he thinks, right?

14:07.941 --> 14:12.225
And that's going to be true in any field you go to.

14:12.245 --> 14:14.648
And Sean, you said you're from California?

14:14.668 --> 14:14.848
Uh-huh.

14:14.868 --> 14:15.729
And how about yourself?

14:15.829 --> 14:18.312
And how did Durkheim think?

14:18.372 --> 14:20.254
Where in California, by the way?

14:20.234 --> 14:24.871
I was in the San Francisco area, Marin County.

14:25.051 --> 14:28.203
You know, I was late to college, catalogs and books.

14:28.965 --> 14:30.531
We were looking for books.

14:31.777 --> 14:33.759
What were you looking at?

14:33.819 --> 14:35.981
I was just looking at college brochures.

14:38.263 --> 14:40.826
I'm interested in the chronological approach.

14:40.866 --> 14:42.808
That's to me the best thing about it.

14:43.969 --> 14:47.232
Now I realize other things that are a bit pages about St.

14:47.292 --> 14:47.512
John's.

14:47.573 --> 14:52.277
I mean the approach to learning, the kinds of dialogue that we foster, things like this.

14:52.878 --> 14:55.761
You couldn't get that from the guidebooks.

14:56.381 --> 14:58.223
In the guidebooks you could get the idea that

14:59.114 --> 15:00.981
You were studying things chronologically.

15:01.001 --> 15:09.833
I liked the idea of, as I was saying, having a foundation, not just going into... I mean, if I'm going to use calculus,

15:10.201 --> 15:12.104
to build a bridge or something like that.

15:12.144 --> 15:19.534
I want to be able to not just ask how to do that, but why I'm doing it and how this fits in the greater context of things.

15:19.695 --> 15:22.238
What are your career plans?

15:23.220 --> 15:26.905
Well, I don't see any reason to leave the ivory tower.

15:27.085 --> 15:29.629
I don't see any reason to leave the ivory tower.

15:30.891 --> 15:39.583
I want to go probably into college teaching, probably humanities, although my current plan is to try and go to England and study literature.

15:40.998 --> 15:49.066
But I'm interested in all the... I'd like to teach courses which incorporate the different types of humanities.

15:49.106 --> 15:51.936
Like, you might have some background in art and music,

15:52.203 --> 15:58.151
And I'd like to do something that would involve, you know, philosophy, history, literature, art, music, if such a thing is possible to find.

15:58.171 --> 16:00.415
So you say, I see no reason to leave the ivory tower.

16:00.435 --> 16:04.240
The assumption is that we are in the ivory tower.

16:04.701 --> 16:06.704
Fair assumption?

16:06.764 --> 16:09.327
The ivory is of them all, I would say.

16:09.347 --> 16:11.190
It just, I mean, nothing is unique, but...

16:11.407 --> 16:22.684
Do you feel that you've missed anything in this panel?

16:22.704 --> 16:28.492
The one thing I think that's lacking from the program is that we don't get historical context.

16:28.512 --> 16:29.594
We don't study history here.

16:29.734 --> 16:35.963
I really wish we had some way to send a perspective to say

16:36.398 --> 16:51.338
But we were just special Rousseau, and we didn't discuss the French Revolution at all.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.220
We don't really talk about that at all.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.646
We're about to read the Declaration of Independence, and we don't have any sort of context there either.

16:57.666 --> 16:58.407
I think that that's really important.

16:59.146 --> 17:03.531
The history of ideas is important, but the true of events is also important.

17:03.893 --> 17:06.608
So are you expecting to do that independently then?

17:07.027 --> 17:17.540
Well, we're not expected to do it, but it's not part of the curriculum.

17:17.640 --> 17:28.693
I guess the counter-argument to that is that, and I think the reason we probably do it in that way, is that the books are meant to speak to themselves.

17:28.713 --> 17:34.620
I mean, the things are important, the events that surround the ideas, but I think that

17:35.613 --> 17:59.190
the books are supposed to stand alone, and the ideas are supposed to stand alone.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.295
We don't bring the historical context in because... I think the idea is something like, if the idea is great, then it doesn't need anything to enhance it.

18:02.731 --> 18:09.740
rise above the circumstances of time and human events that have surrounded it.

18:10.181 --> 18:15.428
And it will, I guess, reveal it's possible, separate from it.

18:15.728 --> 18:25.802
How about in terms of college experience being, I mean, I look around, I don't think I would conclude that this student body is a microcosm of

18:25.782 --> 18:43.524
in the world of America.

18:43.544 --> 18:44.084
You wouldn't conclude that?

18:44.104 --> 18:44.425
Maybe I'm wrong.

18:44.445 --> 18:44.985
I don't see much diversity.

18:45.005 --> 18:45.566
They're mostly white people.

18:45.586 --> 18:46.127
Is that what you're saying?

18:46.147 --> 18:46.407
I don't know.

18:46.387 --> 19:07.489
Yeah, I think that's generally true, and it's a really interesting question.

19:07.509 --> 19:07.829
A fair question.

19:07.849 --> 19:07.949
Sure.

19:07.969 --> 19:09.271
I think that has to do with, I mean, who's on the rating list?

19:09.291 --> 19:09.791
Dead white men?

19:09.811 --> 19:10.372
Really, that community.

19:10.392 --> 19:11.533
How do you respond as a woman to that?

19:12.509 --> 19:20.042
I mean, I ask the questions, the questions that come up for me when I read the book.

19:20.082 --> 19:24.490
I ask them, and I ask them in class.

19:24.510 --> 19:31.362
I guess the thing about this campus that I've noticed is that this school, both campuses,

19:31.342 --> 19:38.091
I've never met a group of people where the individuals were so distinctly individual.

19:38.111 --> 19:42.517
Each person has a mind of their own and they're different.

19:43.157 --> 19:51.929
I look around and I see really interesting people as individuals and I know that their thoughts are different from mine in every way.

19:51.949 --> 19:56.775
We'll read the same book and I'll come to class and they'll say things that I never would have thought of.

19:56.755 --> 20:02.902
And they're really distinct in that way from each other.

20:02.962 --> 20:04.904
And I think that's a great thing.

20:04.924 --> 20:23.705
I mean, I think in that way, although we appear homogenous externally, I think we're more... Well, I mean, I think that's... I guess I'm just comparing the mind to the external impairment.

20:23.725 --> 20:26.408
And my experience at another college was that

20:26.388 --> 20:33.081
People didn't question or think independently of each other in the ways that students do care.

20:33.222 --> 20:35.352
You said earlier that before you...

20:35.534 --> 20:41.421
came here, you decided that what I wanted to do was read for the rest of my life.

20:41.521 --> 20:45.705
I'm clear to conclude that books have always mattered to you?

20:45.725 --> 20:53.714
Yes, definitely they've always mattered to me, but they started mattering to me more when I read War and Peace.

20:53.734 --> 20:54.896
That was a really significant experience.

20:54.916 --> 20:57.659
That was really the defining experience.

20:57.679 --> 20:58.800
What brought you to War and Peace?

20:58.820 --> 20:59.601
That's a big book.

20:59.581 --> 21:07.109
I found it on sale at a second-hand store.

21:07.290 --> 21:23.968
I found it at the point where I was exasperated with the public education system and trying to put myself into it.

21:24.775 --> 21:27.239
Sean, do books always matter to you?

21:27.519 --> 21:39.597
Well, a friend of mine from the Santa Fe campus once said to me, I don't think there's ever been a point in my life, you know, since I can remember, in other words, after I learned to read, in which I wasn't reading some book.

21:39.617 --> 21:43.543
There was no period of my life in which there wasn't a book in my life somewhere.

21:43.603 --> 21:50.013
I think I can probably say that's true of me and myself, too.

21:50.033 --> 21:50.213
You know?

21:50.233 --> 21:52.576
Do you read for questions?

21:53.237 --> 21:53.618
Well,

21:53.935 --> 21:58.740
How is all your reading books like that?

22:00.061 --> 22:04.206
Any reading data you would rather not have to do?

22:04.226 --> 22:06.568
125 books fascinating.

22:07.209 --> 22:08.891
Overwhelmingly warping.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.074
I don't know if I could read Copernicus.

22:12.094 --> 22:16.378
I mean, to me, has been described as the greatest book I've ever read.

22:16.479 --> 22:21.664
I mean, you have to take reading, at least in my own case,

22:21.847 --> 22:23.069
is only part of the equation.

22:23.129 --> 22:29.602
In other words, reading is basically taking in other people's ideas, other people's experiences of life.

22:30.163 --> 22:35.913
It's like an experience that you wouldn't be getting through a book, but just through living.

22:35.994 --> 22:41.003
In other words, it's a different type of experience, but it's still taking in experience.

22:41.270 --> 22:42.372
i.e.

22:42.392 --> 22:50.584
painting, poetry, even perhaps critical essays, those are borderline, involve a totally different kind of experience of life.

22:50.704 --> 23:01.000
And so for me, I mean, letter writing, poetry, painting, these kind of things should complement reading because that way you get both

23:01.570 --> 23:04.754
appreciation and creation, which are really integral.

23:04.894 --> 23:08.159
So I would say that reading wouldn't be enough.

23:08.299 --> 23:15.228
You need to take what you do and either express it in your profession, or I would say preferably do some sort of art.

23:15.368 --> 23:19.313
Is this discussed with you when you come here?

23:19.333 --> 23:22.537
Is this an understanding of comprehension that you develop?

23:22.577 --> 23:25.401
Is there an orientation here where

23:25.381 --> 23:39.174
You are told this is what the school is and this is what it isn't.

23:39.194 --> 23:41.896
No, there's no reason.

23:41.916 --> 23:48.622
I think it's just how many of them come here, if we know what we're getting into.

23:48.642 --> 23:50.244
And in order to get accepted as a school, we have to write a series of messages.

23:50.264 --> 23:51.244
I think it's five to ten pages.

23:51.264 --> 23:55.168
So we really have to demonstrate that we know what the program is all about.

23:55.148 --> 24:08.329
We're willing and able to take responsibility for our own education.

24:08.910 --> 24:11.855
We're responsible for ourselves.

24:11.875 --> 24:21.510
The level of accountability is a lot higher because we read the books, we go to class prepared or unprepared.

24:21.490 --> 24:29.568
We don't take tests, so it's really up to us to determine how much we get out of it.

24:29.588 --> 24:38.447
So basically any kid who's admitted here is going to graduate if he or she can stay in the course.

24:38.467 --> 24:41.794
I was in a class this morning, 14 kids can really

24:42.095 --> 25:01.369
I would say of the 14, 6 really participated, 10 participated to a degree according to the same word once.

25:01.349 --> 25:25.855
springtime and the weather is nice and see what happens you're sitting in a senior class too i'm practicing that into the equation what class is it i'm curious um there's a 10-21 literature uh there's a robert we did a robert flash call over the whole um scooter

25:25.835 --> 25:33.164
you know, we're all responsible for our own education.

25:33.184 --> 25:35.588
I think that that there are tutors is very important.

25:35.608 --> 25:39.413
I wouldn't be able to go look on a desert island and read the ones that find books on my own.

25:39.433 --> 25:42.917
I think that tutors really help us with asking the right questions.

25:42.937 --> 25:52.990
And I think by junior and senior years, I think we get a better idea of what sort of questions are appropriate and what sort of questions are important.

25:52.970 --> 26:10.994
Would you agree that this kind of educational philosophy is not for everyone?

26:11.215 --> 26:12.376
I don't know.

26:12.396 --> 26:15.600
I don't really know what does it mean to say it's right for everyone.

26:15.641 --> 26:20.107
Do I think that this is the type of education that a person should have to be an educated person?

26:20.868 --> 26:21.188
Yes.

26:21.472 --> 26:23.555
But do I think that it's right for everyone?

26:23.595 --> 26:27.140
I'm not sure what that question would mean.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.883
Does it take into account everyone's learning style?

26:30.464 --> 26:33.248
Does it study all the possible subject matters?

26:33.849 --> 26:34.510
Obviously not.

26:34.970 --> 26:43.041
However, if someone could say that they're an educated person without a history of mathematics or a history of philosophy,

26:43.173 --> 26:45.137
I would say probably not.

26:45.157 --> 26:48.785
How do you weigh in, anyone, can I just say your name when you start?

26:49.286 --> 26:53.435
How do you weigh in with this canon debate, this cultural debate?

26:53.535 --> 27:01.772
For instance, you hear in some quarters that for literature to be relevant to our...

27:01.752 --> 27:08.747
to our contemporary life and situation that people don't want to read.

27:09.368 --> 27:12.535
You used the phrase dead white European males.

27:12.695 --> 27:16.463
Does a book have to be relevant, not only the importance of being read?

27:16.483 --> 27:17.044
This is Sean.

27:17.145 --> 27:17.706
Go ahead.

27:17.726 --> 27:18.327
This is Sean.

27:18.492 --> 27:26.414
In a certain sense, all the books that we're reading are totally relevant to the current situation.

27:26.815 --> 27:28.279
You have to see how that is the case.

27:28.299 --> 27:33.514
In other words, the issues that Homer is addressing in the Odyssey, what does it mean?

27:33.494 --> 27:57.358
to go out and search for something in life and how do you find it and what is it what are the questions of love and questions of you know honesty and discovery all these questions are questions everyone's going to ask themselves in one format or another um in this particularly my sophomore year i had a teacher his name was mr vancatech and christine had him also he was able to take the poetry

27:57.338 --> 27:59.782
and tell stories about his own life.

27:59.802 --> 28:09.416
For example, when he was in China, he would relate medieval English poetry to his recent experience in China in such a way that everyone is just blown away and touched by it.

28:09.756 --> 28:22.255
So I firmly believe that all the things we're reading are relevant, but I don't side on the people who think this is the only education that someone should have and they should stop with these 100 great books and that other things aren't worth reading.

28:22.315 --> 28:25.219
I think there are plenty of other things that are worth reading.

28:25.199 --> 28:30.885
All I would contend is that, just from my own view, it makes more sense to do things chronologically.

28:30.905 --> 28:32.867
In other words, to start with the Greeks and then move up.

28:33.167 --> 28:36.390
That's not that I think that more modern things shouldn't be tackled.

28:36.530 --> 28:39.654
It shouldn't be stopped with the great books and just keep studying them deeper and deeper.

28:39.894 --> 28:45.559
In my view, I think you should expand and do Eastern thought and do 20th century different thoughts after you've done this.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.863
I did look to your Helen Vendler for this book.

28:48.883 --> 28:51.105
She's a great critic of poetry.

28:51.322 --> 28:54.850
Shakespeare.

28:55.592 --> 28:59.461
And I asked him that question.

28:59.521 --> 29:04.071
He said, the word divine is its own excuse for relevance.

29:04.091 --> 29:07.018
You don't have to make a case of relevance for Shakespeare.

29:07.038 --> 29:08.281
And that's the short answer.

29:08.301 --> 29:10.225
So I'm curious to see how he works.

29:10.205 --> 29:21.016
Could you imagine getting an undergraduate degree without him studying or reading Shakespeare?

29:22.097 --> 29:22.657
Could you imagine that?

29:22.678 --> 29:23.839
Could you imagine doing that?

29:23.859 --> 29:30.686
Could you imagine being an English major at a all-time Amorist, at Princeton, at Brown, where it's possible to get a degree in English and not ever having been required to read Shakespeare?

29:30.706 --> 29:38.153
How is it possible to have a degree in English literature and not having, and I do believe Amorist didn't get graduated a summa,

29:38.133 --> 30:06.317
That's a great pity, of course, but whether, I don't know, the issues... I don't know, I mean, maybe one of the two would speak or not, because I'm not going to make any statements about the canon as an off, in other words, whether someone, if they've read X, Y, or Z, ought to be allowed to do X, Y, or Z, but I will say that

30:06.365 --> 30:19.452
I cannot imagine someone never studying Shakespeare because Shakespeare is so incredibly beautiful and moving and profound.

30:19.593 --> 30:22.258
I think the idea is the same.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.605
It doesn't quite make sense.

30:25.585 --> 30:40.469
It seems to be foundational to any kind of understanding of language.

30:41.611 --> 30:50.766
Personally, I haven't experienced any other writer who has even touched the use of language that he has done.

30:50.746 --> 30:55.972
Yeah, I think it's really foundational to any other.

30:56.152 --> 30:59.856
Who do you read for pleasure?

30:59.916 --> 31:00.977
Do you read?

31:01.198 --> 31:03.180
I read lots of different people for pleasure.

31:03.460 --> 31:11.309
Right now, I tend toward more modern people just because of what I'm reading for school.

31:11.429 --> 31:14.453
But I read Shakespeare's Honest for pleasure.

31:14.553 --> 31:19.318
I've been reading Jeanette Winterson.

31:19.923 --> 31:22.627
I can't really handle junk.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.310
I don't do junk very well.

31:25.370 --> 31:32.980
I mean, I guess this school has probably had... No, I have to say that before I ever came here, I couldn't deal with junk.

31:33.541 --> 31:43.053
I mean, I remember reading... I hate to sort of... Well, I don't want to name any names, but I read a couple of... Like a John Christian novel.

31:43.073 --> 31:46.518
And I felt sick because I'd read a couple of Dickens.

31:46.658 --> 31:48.040
You know, and I felt like...

31:48.020 --> 31:56.789
The difference in the quality between them was astounding.

31:57.110 --> 32:04.037
Superfluous, truly superficial and heartless.

32:04.698 --> 32:07.540
That's just before I ever came to St.

32:07.561 --> 32:07.721
John's.

32:07.741 --> 32:12.466
Now I read differently than I did before.

32:12.586 --> 32:17.571
I don't have the patience or the taste for John's really.

32:18.226 --> 32:19.908
There's something else that St.

32:19.928 --> 32:21.950
John's Ben said.

32:21.970 --> 32:22.631
St.

32:22.691 --> 32:26.715
John's forces you to read certain things.

32:26.735 --> 32:31.701
You're supposed to think that you wouldn't approach on your own.

32:31.801 --> 32:41.972
I wasn't ever a student of poetry before I read Shakespeare, and then when I was a career, I mean, outside of school, I think there was a lot of money to consider that.

32:41.952 --> 32:51.255
And I would have never approached that on my hands had I not been exposed to it.

32:51.315 --> 32:54.584
There are no elections and everything is required.

32:54.744 --> 32:57.531
Except for our junior junior year.

32:57.511 --> 32:59.376
Preceptorial.

32:59.958 --> 33:06.356
So all three of us are in the same preceptorial.

33:06.376 --> 33:07.479
Did you call it again?

33:07.499 --> 33:08.141
Preceptorial.

33:08.161 --> 33:10.588
Preceptorial.

33:10.608 --> 33:12.533
Preceptorial.

33:12.513 --> 33:30.589
On a particular subject, depending on what is offered that year, we were all in a precept on the brothers' grandma.

33:30.569 --> 33:34.455
We read it through twice.

33:34.475 --> 33:38.983
I think that's a great way to push.

33:39.303 --> 33:41.467
There are other precepts.

33:41.487 --> 33:46.855
There are pre-sutorials on different levels.

33:46.915 --> 33:52.965
There was a Wittgenstein pre-sutorial, there was a Faraday, there were different precepts.

33:52.945 --> 34:04.219
How do you know how you're doing?

34:04.339 --> 34:05.962
You don't get grades?

34:05.982 --> 34:14.432
We call this classes, by the way, the class I was in this morning.

34:14.452 --> 34:15.814
He didn't fall on anyone.

34:15.794 --> 34:20.409
You haven't contributed to this for an hour.

34:20.509 --> 34:23.017
If you didn't say that, did that ever happen?

34:23.037 --> 34:24.923
Well, we have Don Rags.

34:24.943 --> 34:25.946
There's something called Don Rags.

34:25.966 --> 34:29.297
It's when our guns drag on it.

34:29.513 --> 34:32.858
But they call it downracks because they sit on their rear.

34:32.878 --> 34:34.500
They don their rear.

34:34.520 --> 34:34.720
Right.

34:34.801 --> 34:36.563
So they become formal.

34:36.723 --> 34:41.470
They don't actually sit on them, but the point is that, yeah, it's a formal evaluation.

34:41.911 --> 34:47.058
And they're all your tutors and they sit there and they speak to you.

34:47.078 --> 34:49.922
They speak about you in the third person as if you're not there, but you're sitting there.

34:49.942 --> 34:51.585
What kind of things do they say?

34:51.605 --> 34:51.825
They say...

34:51.805 --> 34:52.487
Ms.

34:52.587 --> 34:56.359
Love was very prepared.

34:56.941 --> 34:58.887
She listened well.

34:59.028 --> 35:01.154
She was thoughtful.

35:01.335 --> 35:02.338
She listened well.

35:02.588 --> 35:04.370
Did they ever say, Ms.

35:04.430 --> 35:06.773
Love was sleeping daily?

35:06.873 --> 35:08.756
And then it started working on her finger.

35:08.796 --> 35:13.742
There was one kid up there working on his fingernails the whole class.

35:13.762 --> 35:17.146
I said, this guy's not going to say anything.

35:17.166 --> 35:17.867
And guess what?

35:17.987 --> 35:22.012
At one point, 45 minutes into the class, he came forward.

35:22.032 --> 35:22.533
He contributed.

35:22.593 --> 35:26.838
It happens, I was an English major, and I kind of got into this.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.380
And he said something really good.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.862
And it was the same.

35:29.842 --> 35:36.188
Well, I mean, I don't know.

35:36.328 --> 35:58.110
It's the same difficulty question you have.

35:58.495 --> 36:01.980
class where there's not a strict multiple choice test.

36:02.460 --> 36:14.717
I mean, it's easier, I guess, to evaluate essays than it would be to evaluate classroom participation, but it's still a call of the teacher, the professor, the tutor, as to what counts as excellence and what doesn't.

36:14.737 --> 36:18.242
But I guess a more important question is that

36:18.526 --> 36:21.795
In high school, it was all measured by tests.

36:21.975 --> 36:27.469
You stayed up all night and studied as hard as you could, and you got this grade on this test, and you could get into Harvard or whatever.

36:28.271 --> 36:34.628
But there wasn't an idea that learning also involved how you were toward other people.

36:34.861 --> 36:50.898
whether you listen to them well, whether you were compassionate to what they were saying, whether you were helpful, you know, in other words, challenge their ideas in ways that were helpful to them, not in ways that were harmful to them or to the other part of the conversation, you know, that you participated your equal share, but not too much or not too little.

36:51.479 --> 36:57.606
These are types of things which are not, you can go home and study for three hours and know the facts.

36:57.626 --> 37:00.649
That's completely different than, I don't know how you want to

37:00.916 --> 37:01.917
what phrase you want to say.

37:01.937 --> 37:06.421
I would say it's more a spiritual kind of thing, where a human dynamic.

37:07.302 --> 37:10.925
So in your Donrack, they would address both of these questions.

37:10.945 --> 37:13.307
They would first address how well you prepare for the class.

37:13.747 --> 37:17.250
You know, if you're calling to do math propositions, you could never do any of them.

37:17.270 --> 37:19.352
Well, they're not going to like that very much.

37:19.372 --> 37:28.380
But even if you could do them all, but you were totally rude to people in class, or you weren't considerate, or you weren't helpful, they'll tell you that.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.120
So it's a part of that, isn't it?

37:29.300 --> 37:29.961
I mean, education,

37:30.515 --> 37:34.028
What we hear is not just about facts, not just about knowledge,

37:34.177 --> 37:36.020
the old style, the way players are out of it.

37:36.040 --> 37:39.464
If you're an educated person, you should try and become virtuous.

37:39.484 --> 37:45.293
You know, whether we actually achieve that is a totally different question, but at least it's the standard that's set up.

37:45.753 --> 37:47.856
I'm sorry, Ben, tell me about your own aspirations.

37:48.096 --> 37:50.139
I'm interested in business.

37:50.360 --> 37:55.527
I will definitely go into graduate school.

37:55.907 --> 37:59.012
There are different programs.

37:59.032 --> 38:02.817
There's one, there are a lot of joint programs

38:03.134 --> 38:10.448
between divinity schools and physical schools, and then there are actual physics-ethics programs, but most of those are abroad.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.317
I'm looking at a few right now.

38:12.702 --> 38:38.423
Any downside to this place One of the

38:38.808 --> 38:55.146
for me one of the downsides was there's not as good of a community feeling here as my high school in my high school there was an art show everybody would go not because they were great art connoisseurs but just because they were supporting their friends same with sports theater um i

38:55.784 --> 39:04.382
I mean, other people might feel more of a community than I do, but there was a meeting recently, and we had discussions about why we don't have as much of a community as we'd like to, and how we could improve it.

39:04.402 --> 39:07.288
I think that's even more true in Santa Fe than it is here.

39:07.308 --> 39:11.717
It's a lack of a kind of cohesive, not necessarily intellectual community,

39:12.288 --> 39:16.477
I don't know, a cultural extracurricular community.

39:16.658 --> 39:19.684
I disagree with that completely.

39:19.704 --> 39:32.372
I think there is a real community here and that the aspects of it are interwoven, the intellectual part, the artistic, the extracurricular.

39:32.352 --> 39:40.166
I have friends who participate in lots of different things, and they're my friends as well.

39:40.226 --> 39:46.277
We can talk about ideas, or we can talk about things that are going on, or we can do sports together.

39:46.443 --> 40:04.789
maybe uh sean's response well i don't know i mean we have different we obviously have different opinions um of being a senior here i've you know i've developed some really close friendships and i think that um that everyone seems to me that everyone participates in the community including the tutors and the students and that um

40:04.769 --> 40:07.313
That's been one of the best things about St.

40:07.573 --> 40:16.347
John's for me is that it is a community, that there are only 400 and some students and we all know each other.

40:16.387 --> 40:20.133
If we don't know each other's names, we know each other's what we all look like.

40:20.234 --> 40:26.203
We know when there's someone on campus that doesn't quite, we wonder who they are.

40:26.183 --> 40:32.595
And I guess I feel like that's what helped me to feel.

40:33.196 --> 40:35.700
It contributes to learning.

40:35.720 --> 40:40.088
I mean, it means learning at all times and not just in the classroom.

40:40.189 --> 40:41.251
Well, let me give you an example.

40:41.271 --> 40:47.883
Like last night we had this singing group, the Madrigal Singers, and we've been rehearsing all semester for the performance.

40:47.923 --> 40:50.267
Only about 30 or 40 people came.

40:50.247 --> 40:54.653
Whereas my high school, a concert like that would have brought at least 80 or 90% of the school.

40:55.234 --> 40:58.819
You'd think that at least 100 people would show up for a musical event like that.

40:58.839 --> 41:04.086
From my point of view, I don't want to say it's because people don't care.

41:04.286 --> 41:08.452
I agree with Christine that there's a lot of close friendships here and a lot of people participating in different activities.

41:09.053 --> 41:12.357
It's just that the program is so demanding upon people's time.

41:12.522 --> 41:20.596
that it's hard to take time out and say, go watch a basketball game or watch a concert, because you have to prepare this big neutral population and read these 50 pages of con.

41:20.617 --> 41:23.221
And there's so much time that that's one of the things.

41:23.662 --> 41:31.476
But again, this is like, you know, it's good that you have a balanced perspective on this issue, because obviously, anyone who's got a problem with the school,

41:31.456 --> 41:53.700
Harder to say it's a universal problem if you get a lot of students, it might just be someone's perspective.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.444
On a collegiate basis or a club basis?

41:56.464 --> 41:57.265
Yeah, we did this.

41:57.285 --> 42:01.831
Virtually everyone participates at some time or another.

42:01.851 --> 42:02.012
Yeah.

42:02.032 --> 42:03.774
Poquet is great.

42:04.695 --> 42:08.741
Can't you play in the Naval Academy in Poquet?

42:08.761 --> 42:08.861
Yeah.

42:08.881 --> 42:11.004
This Saturday, actually, yeah.

42:11.024 --> 42:12.306
Have you the women participated in that?

42:12.326 --> 42:14.609
There are many women on the team this year, if they can.

42:14.709 --> 42:15.070
But that's good.

42:15.090 --> 42:15.190
Yeah.

42:15.210 --> 42:16.792
I'm trying to think of something back here.

42:16.812 --> 42:17.513
I'm not looking for any gratitude.

42:17.533 --> 42:19.536
No, but... I'm just trying to place this...

42:19.516 --> 42:31.592
I think there's a lot of political apathy here.

42:31.653 --> 42:36.059
I think people don't care about the rest of the world so much, and I think that's the problem.

42:36.139 --> 42:43.869
I think that there is no sense of community.

42:44.250 --> 42:45.912
I disagree with that.

42:46.111 --> 42:48.014
that there is a sense of community, St.

42:48.034 --> 42:57.307
John's community here, but we don't really care so much about Annapolis or Maryland or the United States or the world so much.

42:57.688 --> 42:58.829
We're just isolated.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.211
It's like the ivory tower.

43:00.652 --> 43:13.671
We discuss these great ideas, but we don't put them into... Well, I wouldn't say we don't put them into practice, but we don't see the... We'll read...

43:13.972 --> 43:17.856
Do you think that there is this detachment from the world?

43:17.996 --> 43:21.420
I think that's part of me here.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.922
It's just spare time.

43:25.024 --> 43:31.530
I mean, I don't think that people need me.

43:31.731 --> 43:36.536
You don't see yourself as withdrawing from the real world?

43:36.736 --> 43:39.839
No, we are definitely withdrawn from the real world.

43:39.999 --> 43:40.820
That is so true.

43:40.840 --> 43:41.000
You are.

43:41.020 --> 43:42.662
And you're all saying you are.

43:43.216 --> 43:45.112
I mean, I don't know.

43:45.132 --> 43:48.298
That's a very difficult question because you have to ask yourself.
