00:01.263 --> 00:04.826
I guess.

00:04.967 --> 00:09.351
I love the Handmaid's Tale.

00:09.551 --> 00:25.906
It's not necessarily that I want to talk about that or the new novel or your body of work, but where you did present a theocratic society, and we're having this thing with Rushdie and the Ayatollah.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.831
A comment on this extraordinary turn on something that

00:31.503 --> 00:38.052
Religion and politics is the most potent combination.

00:38.072 --> 00:53.834
But to have a religious leader, the head of the political ring of the society, it is an almost impossible situation for anyone who's a fan.

00:55.597 --> 00:59.502
Because not only are you politically persona non grata,

01:00.173 --> 01:03.277
You're religiously the same.

01:03.677 --> 01:11.126
And in Christianity, which has a history of doing this kind of thing... This is a piece I'm writing for next week, by the way.

01:11.226 --> 01:21.858
It's usually been when the two things were the same, that we brought the witch burnings and the inquisition and all of those other examples.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.942
Our past is not spotless.

01:26.984 --> 01:28.066
But a fiction writer.

01:29.127 --> 01:30.028
A fiction writer.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.970
You mean, where did I get the idea?

01:31.990 --> 01:35.934
No, I mean, still on the OSD.

01:36.014 --> 01:40.059
Oh, you mean, how am I responding to that book?

01:40.079 --> 01:40.219
Okay.

01:40.239 --> 01:46.187
It is interesting that a contract has been put out to kill a novelist, do you think?

01:46.207 --> 01:49.350
Well, worldwide, of course, many novelists and poets have been killed.

01:50.592 --> 01:52.194
Could you cite any instances of that?

01:52.534 --> 01:53.255
Oh, yeah.

01:53.575 --> 01:59.222
All you need to do is get the 10 Writers in Prison Committee's list.

01:59.827 --> 02:02.291
of people who are in prison, missing.

02:03.172 --> 02:04.434
Because of what they've written?

02:04.454 --> 02:05.436
Because of what they've written.

02:05.676 --> 02:06.938
Yeah, absolutely.

02:06.958 --> 02:07.959
All over the place.

02:07.979 --> 02:10.964
This would be a worthwhile thing to pursue, I think.

02:10.984 --> 02:12.667
For you to pursue as a journalist.

02:12.687 --> 02:13.448
Yeah.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.871
Because nobody's picked up on it so far.

02:15.972 --> 02:26.087
Well, we've all been saying it because we have worked with Writers in Prison Committee and we know that the depression of a writer is not a unique event.

02:26.894 --> 02:28.356
in the world that we live in.

02:28.376 --> 02:30.398
And it can take all kinds of forms.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.960
They can be killed surreptitiously.

02:32.980 --> 02:39.948
They can be—I mean, in Mexico, they shoot journalists that shoot bad pieces about the pieces the government doesn't like.

02:39.968 --> 02:47.676
Journalism history, I mean, Socrates was a philosopher, but I mean, a person who writes stories.

02:47.696 --> 02:49.178
Oh, poets.

02:49.198 --> 02:51.420
There are hardly any poets in El Salvador.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.222
They're all either dead or an exile.

02:53.540 --> 03:00.428
There are fiction writers in Killie that have death threats against him at this very moment, even at his feet.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.771
So this is by no means... It's not unique.

03:03.752 --> 03:07.897
What's unique about it is that it's ahead of day doing it openly.

03:08.618 --> 03:09.820
And putting a price on it.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.901
Putting a price on it.

03:11.001 --> 03:12.403
I'm sorry to laugh.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.504
It's not funny.

03:13.624 --> 03:14.285
It's not funny.

03:14.305 --> 03:15.466
I mean, I'm laughing.

03:15.546 --> 03:20.172
No, how they usually do it, how many other people do it, is to do it secretly.

03:21.316 --> 03:24.481
And then they don't admit they've done it.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.044
Death, blood, pressure.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.426
They've disappeared.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.392
What's different about this is that it's so open.

03:32.412 --> 03:44.750
Now, there's another way of looking at it, which was that if he had really wanted this guy dead, he would have had him killed first, and then said why he had done it.

03:44.970 --> 03:51.019
But in fact, I think politically, Salman Rushdie is much more valuable to the Ayatollah alive than dead.

03:51.708 --> 03:56.313
Because alive, he can still be used as a rallying cry.

03:56.493 --> 03:58.255
Dead, that's the end of the incident.

03:58.995 --> 04:01.498
He does think of something else.

04:01.518 --> 04:03.980
Well, that's an excellent comment.

04:04.941 --> 04:08.064
I want to make another comment, which is this.

04:08.084 --> 04:09.966
This also has to be said.

04:09.986 --> 04:18.755
Defending freedom of speech means also defending the freedom of speech of Muslims who don't like the book.

04:18.775 --> 04:20.837
In other words, you can't tell them

04:21.374 --> 04:22.555
to like it if they don't.

04:23.457 --> 04:27.321
And you can't put a muzzle on them and say that they cannot express their dislike.

04:27.682 --> 04:30.145
Do you think there's a movement to do that?

04:30.905 --> 04:37.013
Well, I think when anybody ever says, you know, ban the book, everybody else says, sit down and shut up.

04:37.153 --> 04:39.135
As long as they stay within the law.

04:39.556 --> 04:42.620
You can dislike something without banning it.

04:42.640 --> 04:45.443
I mean, I don't think that's the sense.

04:45.523 --> 04:51.330
Or let us say that there is a backlash and mosques are receiving bomb threats too.

04:52.188 --> 05:00.155
Now, the other thing is, there has been a thundering silence from both the American government and from the Canadian government.

05:00.896 --> 05:04.919
They have not said, as they ought to have said, we will protect our citizens.

05:06.220 --> 05:11.164
Both bookstore owners and Muslims whose mosques are being threatened.

05:11.184 --> 05:13.246
Do you have a sense of why this is?

05:14.647 --> 05:15.108
Aha.

05:15.889 --> 05:16.609
Time will tell.

05:17.090 --> 05:21.013
With our lot, I think it's just general chicken-ness.

05:21.517 --> 05:31.929
If I had had a government that had been involved in something so complicated as the Iran contract scandal, I would have other thoughts.

05:34.432 --> 05:35.173
Very interesting.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.536
We have really said nothing about it, haven't we?

05:37.556 --> 05:38.077
Not officially.

05:38.097 --> 05:40.379
And really, our writers haven't said a whole lot about it.

05:40.479 --> 05:41.501
Oh, they sure have.

05:41.581 --> 05:42.141
I mean, we've got a few.

05:42.161 --> 05:43.163
I mean, we had the thing in New York.

05:43.183 --> 05:44.584
Oh, they had a whole big reading.

05:44.604 --> 05:47.828
They've been on television everywhere I have gone.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.499
I've been asked about this, and I've gone blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:51.860 --> 05:58.309
The Canadian ones have been all over the TV, but... The British have been... The British have been way out there.

05:58.349 --> 06:02.074
Margaret Thatcher has delivered a blistering attack.

06:02.094 --> 06:03.636
Well, did you see the Times this morning?

06:03.716 --> 06:05.699
Well, New York, I'm sorry.

06:05.979 --> 06:14.632
Charles Vowell wrote a letter really taking Rushdie to task, saying he knew what he was doing.

06:15.192 --> 06:16.414
Well, nobody knows that.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.004
Nobody knows whether he knew what he was doing or not.

06:20.565 --> 06:24.550
That kind of comment sounds very much to me like she shouldn't have worn that short dress.

06:25.972 --> 06:28.696
You know, so blame the victim.

06:28.716 --> 06:31.820
Forgive the rapist that she had it coming.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.743
You know, I have no patience with that.

06:35.305 --> 06:39.110
He wasn't joined in the statement either.

06:39.170 --> 06:43.136
Well, first of all, you don't know what another person used or didn't know.

06:44.358 --> 06:45.439
And I saw...

06:46.178 --> 06:52.304
So then, Rusty, before this death threat thing came out, but when people were marching.

06:53.145 --> 06:54.566
And he looked pretty shocked to me.

06:54.586 --> 06:58.210
He may have been acting, but he looked shocked.

06:58.230 --> 06:58.931
Really?

06:58.951 --> 06:59.631
And disturbed.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.135
He was just in Boston.

07:03.155 --> 07:03.455
I know.

07:03.876 --> 07:04.857
This was in London.

07:04.997 --> 07:10.142
I was over there doing this very same thing.

07:10.162 --> 07:16.168
So he may have known that some people wouldn't like it, but I don't think he was in any way anticipating

07:16.891 --> 07:20.456
And also, there are other ways of reading that book.

07:20.476 --> 07:26.945
One whole section of it reads like an apologia for religion, indeed.

07:27.786 --> 07:28.668
I've not yet read it.

07:29.589 --> 07:42.527
Well, when you do, you will find that it is a very complicated piece of business and nowhere near as clear-cut as the comments might have had you believe, for instance.

07:43.182 --> 07:52.215
I think the stuff about the prophet, I guess about the closest analogy, would be, in a way, that's the movie The Life of Brian.

07:52.275 --> 07:53.457
Did you ever see that?

07:54.057 --> 08:01.628
Well, it was a parallel figure, a sort of non-Christ, who, however, keeps getting confused with Christ.

08:01.728 --> 08:02.910
And it's pretty outrageous.

08:04.172 --> 08:11.502
And the end of it, it ends with this outrageous scene in which there are all these people on the cross, and they're doing a song and dance on the cross.

08:11.887 --> 08:23.885
And, you know, it's pretty outrageous, but nobody would ever say this is going to ruin Christianity.

08:23.905 --> 08:29.173
Okay, this would be for one piece that I'm writing on this business.

08:29.193 --> 08:37.546
A lot of Canadian Muslims have come out and said, we don't like the book that we disassociate ourselves in the death row.

08:37.566 --> 08:41.151
And other people are saying, this is not what his land teaches.

08:43.257 --> 08:49.684
The death threat is not our understanding of the spirit of our religion.

08:50.105 --> 09:01.598
Meanwhile, I talked to the publicist at Viking Press yesterday, and they had 10,000, 10,000, he said, people marching outside their building on Saturday.

09:01.678 --> 09:03.020
In New York.

09:04.161 --> 09:07.865
All anti-Vikings.

09:08.626 --> 09:10.969
I've known publishing people for 12 years.

09:11.607 --> 09:15.273
They don't want you to use their names.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.156
It's like police contacts.

09:17.216 --> 09:19.960
Please just say a Viking spokesperson.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.002
They're getting bomb threats.

09:21.022 --> 09:22.584
I mean, this doesn't happen to publishing houses.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.086
They have 10,000 people.

09:24.587 --> 09:28.313
Well, it has happened to publishing houses in other countries all the time.

09:29.174 --> 09:32.540
It's just that now it's happening here, and we're getting a taste of what it's like.

09:32.580 --> 09:33.081
Extraordinary.

09:33.521 --> 09:35.284
Publishing houses have been closed down.

09:35.304 --> 09:36.165
They've been wiped out.

09:36.205 --> 09:38.509
The people running them have been murdered.

09:39.063 --> 09:44.309
I'm glad I asked you this question because I hadn't even thought about that.

09:44.429 --> 09:48.634
Ask anybody from Argentina during the terror.

09:49.275 --> 09:53.520
Ask people from Chile who are in exile here.

09:53.580 --> 09:58.305
I think the sense of the question is really storytellers.

09:59.707 --> 10:04.412
Writers in general.

10:05.303 --> 10:09.267
I'm going to look at you thinking New York might have some stuff on that.

10:09.368 --> 10:10.229
Oh, yes, they would.

10:10.289 --> 10:12.711
Call Karen Kennerly.

10:12.731 --> 10:13.813
Karen Kennerly.

10:13.833 --> 10:14.794
K-A-R-E-N.

10:15.675 --> 10:15.955
Kennerly.

10:15.975 --> 10:18.538
K-E-N-N-E-R-L-Y.

10:18.558 --> 10:23.303
Karen Kennerly at the Penn New York office.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.327
Just shut this up for a second.

10:26.627 --> 10:26.947
Say that.

10:27.228 --> 10:32.053
We're trying to get a woman out of prison in another country who's there because of something her husband wants.

10:37.788 --> 10:43.522
Well, I think we're just very naive.

10:43.542 --> 10:47.693
Is that quite a few more?

10:47.713 --> 10:52.484
There's a bag there, but there's also a bag there.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.750
There's a lot of water.

11:10.576 --> 11:13.339
No, thank you, Ms.

11:13.359 --> 11:17.203
Black.

11:18.724 --> 11:25.110
Novelists, for me, are the most difficult interviews, because a novel, to me, speaks for itself.

11:25.551 --> 11:26.592
Good for you.

11:26.612 --> 11:28.814
Good for you.

11:30.636 --> 11:31.797
Either it does or it doesn't.

11:31.817 --> 11:35.180
Either it doesn't, or it does or it doesn't.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.883
And so we kind of do have to dance around a little bit.

11:38.167 --> 11:39.630
I hope that's okay.

11:39.870 --> 11:45.420
I have a wonderful review of your book, which I signed and which I have and which I'm running a week from Sunday.

11:45.440 --> 11:52.933
So if you don't mind, we won't necessarily talk about the novel, but we probably will in any case, but I won't certainly ask you to explain things.

11:53.614 --> 11:55.216
That's my job.

11:56.118 --> 11:57.140
You know what I'm saying.

11:57.160 --> 12:03.651
However, if you don't mind, and consider it a naive question, but why do you feel that you need the disclaimer?

12:04.120 --> 12:14.353
Because with every single one of my other books, including The Handmaid's Tale, somebody has tried to make out that it was autobiographical, including The Handmaid's Tale.

12:14.373 --> 12:15.995
Including The Handmaid's Tale.

12:16.015 --> 12:17.758
Well, people are now asking E.L.

12:17.778 --> 12:23.685
Baltero whether Billy Bosgate's character was autobiographical.

12:23.725 --> 12:27.310
Did he hang out with Scott Schultz?

12:28.252 --> 12:30.335
It wasn't, it wasn't.

12:30.635 --> 12:34.200
I mean, I then said to him, did this happen to that, and he said, no, I made it up.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.544
But I mean, we get our ideas from things.

12:37.564 --> 12:42.390
Oh, sure, you get your ideas from things, but that's not the same as saying it's the story of your life.

12:42.410 --> 12:44.693
Right, otherwise you call it a memoir.

12:44.753 --> 12:50.881
Otherwise you call it a memoir, and you try not to lie too much, or else if you lie, you know it's lying.

12:51.361 --> 12:52.723
So this was...

12:52.973 --> 12:58.378
a statement, please don't ask me any more questions about... Well, it had the opposite effect.

12:58.398 --> 13:07.405
Well, it is rather an unusual... Actually, it's almost the same thing that Alice Monroe put at the front of Life of Girls and Women.

13:07.565 --> 13:08.366
I don't recall.

13:08.386 --> 13:20.637
Well, she said, this may sound like another form of... this is autobiographical, but as soon as you write in the first person, people say, uh-huh.

13:20.677 --> 13:22.238
Why are the paintings...

13:22.758 --> 13:23.880
Not real.

13:24.601 --> 13:25.702
Why are they not real?

13:25.722 --> 13:25.863
Yeah.

13:26.524 --> 13:28.446
What do you mean?

13:28.466 --> 13:29.248
They don't exist?

13:29.268 --> 13:29.408
Yeah.

13:30.069 --> 13:30.590
I mean, they're real.

13:30.630 --> 13:31.891
I'm sorry, they don't exist, yes.

13:32.552 --> 13:33.955
Why not use real paintings?

13:34.876 --> 13:36.438
Why not use real paintings?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.762
Because they wouldn't have in them what I would want them to have in.

13:40.104 --> 13:40.865
That's a good answer.

13:41.706 --> 13:41.806
Yeah.

13:41.826 --> 13:43.328
That's a wonderful answer.

13:43.469 --> 13:44.770
What other real paintings would I use?

13:44.791 --> 13:47.014
They would be by an existing artist.

13:47.114 --> 13:47.615
Right.

13:48.396 --> 13:49.077
Of course.

13:49.237 --> 13:50.599
That is a nice question.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.921
I apologize for that.

13:53.150 --> 13:58.717
If you're going to make up an artist, you have to make up their art, too.

13:58.737 --> 13:58.957
Right.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.301
I'm sorry.

14:02.321 --> 14:04.904
I do like the epigraph, though.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.387
Why do we always look at the past?

14:07.828 --> 14:10.411
Why do we remember the past and not the future?

14:10.431 --> 14:11.252
And not the future.

14:11.693 --> 14:16.078
Well, of course, as soon as you say that, you think, maybe we do remember the future.

14:17.139 --> 14:21.705
Well, and of course the question meets nicely into the previous novel.

14:22.242 --> 14:27.409
And I wonder if you saw these two as a pair, in a way.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.510
The future in the past?

14:28.530 --> 14:33.917
Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty basic question, but you certainly are reflecting in this one.

14:33.937 --> 14:41.867
Well, the Handmaid's Tale is also about the past, of course, because there's nothing in it that human societies have not done.

14:43.249 --> 14:49.397
So, in fact, a great deal more historical research went into it than went into Catholics.

14:50.542 --> 14:55.668
Was there any reason why you set that in Cambridge?

14:55.868 --> 14:59.152
Absolutely every reason you can possibly imagine.

14:59.172 --> 15:01.414
Number one, home of the Puritans.

15:01.434 --> 15:07.060
Number two, seed of one of the great institutions, one of the great living institutions of learning.

15:07.881 --> 15:18.033
And if it's Harvard, in which widely libraries have been taken as a secret service, you can imagine what the rest of the country is like.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.295
Number three, I lived there for four years.

15:20.782 --> 15:30.981
Number four, my ancestors were 17th century American parents, and then came to Massachusetts, India.

15:31.001 --> 15:39.516
So that when I came to Harvard, which I did in 1961, I was retaking ancestral steps.

15:40.002 --> 15:46.631
a certain rag yard which exists there and the wall.

15:46.871 --> 15:48.994
Cambridge is one of my favorite places.

15:49.014 --> 16:04.694
Well you probably don't know what all the buildings were for instance the Stoll Stolls is the Harvard Coupes and the place where they get their costumes is the Brattle Theatre and you can walk the whole thing out.

16:04.795 --> 16:07.478
It's not being filmed there where it's locked, it's being filmed in

16:07.880 --> 16:11.905
in North Carolina, which will do very well.

16:12.045 --> 16:17.311
But, of course, Harvard is quite careful about this book.

16:17.331 --> 16:20.635
They didn't think it was amusing to have all those bodies hanging on the wall.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.159
No, no, and I can appreciate that.

16:24.179 --> 16:25.701
And I didn't mean to be asking.

16:25.721 --> 16:29.706
Well, the other reason was, of course, Terry Miller was one of my professors.

16:29.726 --> 16:34.211
And he's the man who almost single-handedly resurrected the study of American food.

16:35.673 --> 16:37.735
So I thought it quite fitting.

16:37.900 --> 16:41.645
It wasn't necessarily a comment on the United States then, per se.

16:41.746 --> 16:43.208
It was just inappropriate.

16:43.348 --> 16:44.049
Oh, it was.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.331
Oh, yes, it was.

16:45.511 --> 16:48.335
Oh, yes, indeed it was.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.278
Some might sniff, why not Canada?

16:50.779 --> 16:52.621
Oh, well, many a good reason.

16:53.042 --> 16:55.966
Canada is a third French and a half Catholic.

16:56.988 --> 16:59.872
It would be very hard to get unanimity.

16:59.892 --> 17:03.597
It's very hard to get unanimity on anything in Canada.

17:03.617 --> 17:06.962
And you certainly would not be able to get that groundswell

17:07.482 --> 17:13.869
Any totalitarian regime needs a 20 to 30 percent support rate to succeed.

17:13.889 --> 17:19.635
You cannot impose a regime upon a population in which nobody agrees with it.

17:19.655 --> 17:20.216
You can't do it.

17:20.236 --> 17:22.678
You need a certain percentage of people to do it.

17:22.698 --> 17:23.059
Okay.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.140
That's an excellent answer.

17:24.600 --> 17:24.921
Yeah.

17:24.941 --> 17:34.531
One other, which comes to mind now, at the very end of Handmaid's Tale, I hope you don't mind my talking about the body of work.

17:34.891 --> 17:35.532
Not at all.

17:35.714 --> 17:37.737
wondering why you jumped way ahead.

17:37.998 --> 17:40.642
Okay, I've got excellent reasons for that as well.

17:42.065 --> 17:57.730
One of them comes from the tradition of the utopia dystopia, and from my feeling, which I've rarely seen talks about, in fact, when I thought of it, I'd never seen it talk about, but 1984 is a much more optimistic book than people have ever given Orwell credit for.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.816
I've never heard this before.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.278
Well, because

18:02.545 --> 18:08.812
It does not end with Winston Smith coming to love their brother, as we all remember it ending.

18:09.553 --> 18:14.719
It ends with a note on Muir's feet written in the past tense in standard English.

18:15.661 --> 18:31.219
Muir's feet was a language which... Now, if you are going to take the whole form of the book seriously, which I do, we have to assume Orwell is therefore saying that society existed in the future, after 1984,

18:31.537 --> 18:41.045
in which a person existed, he could write in this rather dispassionate, scholarly way about Newspeak in the past tense.

18:41.065 --> 18:43.387
Assumption, it no longer exists.

18:43.407 --> 18:52.435
Assumption, I am a free agent who can write about this with great freedom without having the secret police come and do me in.

18:53.056 --> 19:01.003
So from that I concluded that he foresaw beyond 1984 into a future in which it was over.

19:02.030 --> 19:07.196
So a lot of my books are similarly optimistic.

19:07.216 --> 19:13.442
So the pessimistic part of it is that the scholar from Cambridge, England, sounds exactly the same.

19:13.603 --> 19:17.567
But the assumption about that is that those guys never change.

19:17.667 --> 19:22.172
Did you sense that you were writing a thriller type of a book?

19:22.192 --> 19:23.493
Oh, it has to have tension.

19:25.255 --> 19:26.677
Otherwise, you don't turn the page.

19:27.117 --> 19:30.501
The pitfall with utopia is that you can get easily

19:31.021 --> 19:40.451
seduced into giving a tour of the future, which would be just as boring as tours of the stocking factory usually are.

19:41.072 --> 19:47.238
This is how we do things in our society, here's the sewage plant, you know, this place.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.422
So I didn't know what to do about it.

19:50.602 --> 19:57.349
I have a long reading background in this form, and I had ideas about what works and

19:57.852 --> 20:01.736
It was an extraordinarily popular book.

20:01.756 --> 20:02.377
I thought it was.

20:03.097 --> 20:25.480
My other reason for the note at the end, by the way, is that the character in the book lives in such a circumscribed way that there are questions which will occur to the reader that she is unable to know the answers to, because she does not have the freedom of movement and access to information that would allow her to know those answers.

20:25.797 --> 20:32.083
You don't do sequels, thank goodness, but do you ever wonder what happened to her and Tom?

20:32.103 --> 20:34.085
She's done a handmaid tale.

20:34.165 --> 20:38.510
Well, you know, she does go off.

20:38.610 --> 20:39.270
She goes off.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.173
God bless her.

20:42.253 --> 20:43.254
Yes.

20:43.515 --> 20:55.787
The only thing I could think of, the only other thing I could think of doing with that would be to write the story from the point of view of seeing the joy.

20:56.054 --> 21:01.661
But does that appeal to you, or is this completed work?

21:01.902 --> 21:02.642
Not at the moment.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.705
We never know what's going to appeal to you.

21:04.885 --> 21:10.533
I don't think John Updike thought when he wrote Rabbit Run that he would later write two sequels.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.577
Yeah, but that brings me back to the autobiographical thing.

21:13.597 --> 21:16.661
I think Rabbit really is a part of John Updike.

21:16.761 --> 21:18.583
I don't think you deny that either.

21:18.603 --> 21:21.927
Do you think Janice drowned their baby in the bathtub?

21:21.947 --> 21:25.572
No.

21:26.210 --> 21:31.897
And I don't think anybody ever owned a Toyota agency or whatever, but that would be wonderful, and that was rich.

21:33.799 --> 21:53.584
Anyway, it does kind of leap nicely into that Hawking epigraph, past and future, and maybe some like myself can see these two as a peer, because we really are looking backward here, not to still go in these titles or anything.

21:54.070 --> 21:59.297
I wonder what prompted you to go from the very next work to an examination.

21:59.317 --> 22:02.400
Well, this is a work that has been kicking around for some time.

22:03.342 --> 22:07.206
In fact, I have notes on it that go as far back as 1964.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.050
So it wasn't a sort of new thought.

22:10.891 --> 22:14.155
Indeed, I had started it again before I started it.

22:14.624 --> 22:18.568
Really got possessed by Handmaid's Tale, which took over everything.

22:18.588 --> 22:19.329
Were you possessed?

22:19.489 --> 22:21.110
I don't mean to jump around the block here.

22:21.211 --> 22:24.494
You got possessed by any book you write if it's going well.

22:25.335 --> 22:28.017
The moments that you don't feel possessed.

22:28.037 --> 22:31.220
This work was in progress then prior to Handmaid's Tale?

22:31.240 --> 22:33.443
No, I wouldn't even call it in progress.

22:34.544 --> 22:37.727
It was drifting around.

22:39.529 --> 22:40.349
It was drifting around.

22:42.251 --> 22:43.973
Once you have several pages.

22:44.611 --> 22:48.615
That's drifting around, but it's not really in progress.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.057
But it tends to its beginning.

22:51.438 --> 23:01.468
So, and I interrupted you by telling you you became possessed by Handmaid's Tale, that you finished, and then took this up?

23:01.849 --> 23:04.411
Then I came back to this.

23:04.431 --> 23:08.756
So it wasn't a new, it wasn't a totally new idea that I had.

23:08.976 --> 23:10.938
Did the idea change at all?

23:11.238 --> 23:12.880
The idea changed a lot.

23:13.501 --> 23:15.384
But my ideas always change.

23:16.325 --> 23:17.607
How about the characters?

23:17.627 --> 23:19.590
The characters change.

23:19.610 --> 23:25.378
The things that remain constant are things like the Eaton's catalog.

23:25.398 --> 23:27.741
Going to see the trains on Sunday.

23:27.821 --> 23:30.525
But the decades, they remain the same.

23:30.645 --> 23:36.133
Well, history, setting, and time.

23:37.075 --> 23:39.097
obviously are going to remain what they are.

23:39.157 --> 23:42.139
I'm not going to change the 40s into the 20s or anything.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.941
Well, you might have started in the 50s.

23:44.341 --> 23:47.484
I could have started it in the 50s, but then it would have been a different story.

23:47.724 --> 23:49.706
Then you'd have had a younger character.

23:50.086 --> 23:58.974
I would have had a younger character, and I would have missed a lot of those details that I wanted so much, and I've come to knowing that.

23:59.234 --> 24:06.340
Do you find that your characters are advancing in years at the same time?

24:07.248 --> 24:14.175
Well, when I was eighteen I used to write what I thought were these wonderfully insightful stories about very elderly people.

24:16.117 --> 24:17.818
Were they accurate now in retrospect?

24:17.838 --> 24:19.300
Probably not.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.821
They were always in desperate straits.

24:20.861 --> 24:23.444
They always lived in grooming houses or something.

24:23.464 --> 24:27.828
You've been writing for forever, I guess, sixteen.

24:28.249 --> 24:29.049
Fiction always?

24:29.069 --> 24:33.694
Fiction, poetry, and book reviews.

24:34.214 --> 24:39.739
You are, in fact, a woman of letters, writing in many forms.

24:40.460 --> 24:40.900
I know.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.962
Travel articles.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.846
And your poetry has the greatest respect.

24:48.428 --> 24:50.089
And this is the seventh novel, I guess.

24:51.971 --> 24:59.678
But now, when we discuss Margaret Atwood, we almost say novelist first and poet as opposed to poet.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.301
How do you respond to that?

25:02.321 --> 25:03.462
Well, I say writer.

25:03.847 --> 25:06.811
It covers everything.

25:06.831 --> 25:10.696
You don't have to specialize within your own label.

25:10.996 --> 25:17.325
But in terms of perception, of readership, the big readership out there.

25:17.345 --> 25:20.149
More people read novels than read poetry.

25:20.169 --> 25:21.651
A sad state of affairs.

25:21.671 --> 25:23.032
A sad state of affairs.

25:23.052 --> 25:31.103
The people who read poetry tend to read it very precisely.

25:32.045 --> 25:35.009
that has to do with the audience rather than with the writer.

25:36.311 --> 25:39.475
A lot of Canadian writers of my generation wrote those.

25:39.876 --> 25:42.139
Nobody told them not to.

25:42.399 --> 25:48.227
You could get poetry published a lot easier than you could get novels published.

25:50.390 --> 25:58.221
John Upbeck has said, if you are to be remembered as a writer,

25:59.197 --> 26:01.419
What would you like to be remembered for most?

26:01.640 --> 26:03.282
And I believe he has said his poetry.

26:03.802 --> 26:11.251
It's unlikely to happen, but I think his short fiction and his novels, certainly, and his criticism.

26:11.291 --> 26:18.238
Not to say anything bad about his poetry, but I just don't think that that's what people 30 years or 40 or 50 years want.

26:18.258 --> 26:22.223
Let's turn that question on Margaret Atwood.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.485
What would you like most to be?

26:25.326 --> 26:27.769
This question just developed right now, I'm sorry.

26:28.272 --> 26:40.427
Well, I would just turn the question another way and say that my chief wish would be that there will be people around in 50 years to do remembering.

26:42.490 --> 26:48.678
You are this pessimistic about a world population of 10 billion?

26:52.082 --> 26:56.608
How can it not end in disasters?

26:57.128 --> 26:59.131
You do think we're a terminal species then?

26:59.151 --> 27:00.113
No, no, no.

27:00.133 --> 27:06.243
We still have the building to make choices, but we better start making the heavy things.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.505
Let's put the question another way.

27:07.545 --> 27:11.331
What are you proudest of when you have completed work?

27:11.351 --> 27:14.657
I'm not old enough to be asked those questions.

27:14.957 --> 27:17.000
But you're accomplished enough.

27:17.020 --> 27:18.343
You're accomplished enough, however.

27:18.383 --> 27:21.368
I think it's bad luck to ask your questions like that.

27:21.388 --> 27:22.509
And I think that's a good answer.

27:23.631 --> 27:24.132
It's huge enough.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.003
You certainly are a writer who is a Canadian.

27:29.965 --> 27:37.434
Is Canadian literature still evolving, or can we really characterize or describe Canadian literature?

27:37.454 --> 27:40.518
Well, we constantly do characterize it and describe it.

27:41.138 --> 27:46.525
It's like characterizing and describing American literature in the same way.

27:46.625 --> 27:51.891
That is, as soon as you've characterized it and described it, somebody comes along and does something different.

27:52.664 --> 27:56.010
But that's literature, which is wonderful.

27:56.571 --> 28:06.690
But you look at the New York Times bestseller list, and prominent on the fiction side are two Canadian authors, yourself and Robinson Davis.

28:06.710 --> 28:12.160
Well, that's okay, because prominent on our bestseller list are many Americans.

28:12.421 --> 28:14.605
So it sort of balances things out a little.

28:15.310 --> 28:18.072
But we've got ten times as many people as we have.

28:18.092 --> 28:18.853
Well, that's true.

28:18.873 --> 28:20.374
Probably ten times as many offers.

28:21.375 --> 28:24.258
That's about true as well.

28:24.278 --> 28:33.846
So, I mean, to have in the top ten, twenty percent, you know, two out of ten, that's a pretty decent average, isn't it?

28:33.866 --> 28:36.208
Yes, it is fun, and I like Robert from Davis very much.

28:36.228 --> 28:41.393
He was here a couple weeks ago, so I had the opportunity to talk.

28:41.473 --> 28:45.216
And I love the fact that you're just

28:45.517 --> 28:48.601
The only thing you really have in common is that you're Canadian writers.

28:48.621 --> 28:50.583
Oh, we've got more in common than that.

28:50.603 --> 28:51.104
Oh, come on.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.866
I don't want to lose any of this.

28:53.106 --> 28:53.466
You do?

28:54.327 --> 28:54.548
Yes.

28:54.648 --> 28:55.008
Tell me.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.751
I asked him the same question, by the way.

28:58.172 --> 29:02.677
And he said, I'm a boy and she's a girl.

29:02.697 --> 29:13.650
No, let us just say that all Canadians have a body of knowledge in common, just as all Americans have a body of knowledge in common.

29:14.086 --> 29:20.431
But beyond that, we're both from Ontario, where we make that a large part of the material.

29:21.112 --> 29:27.517
I taught a course in Alabama a little while ago, and then I was the same course in New York City.

29:27.537 --> 29:27.938
It was.

29:28.098 --> 29:29.799
It was very interesting.

29:29.819 --> 29:32.822
And it was called Southern Ontario Gothic.

29:34.163 --> 29:37.306
And it was writers from Ontario.

29:37.466 --> 29:43.671
It was Robertson Davies and Alice Munro and Timothy Simblee and Graham Gibson.

29:44.123 --> 29:47.809
and Marian Angle and a number of fathers.

29:47.949 --> 29:50.312
You put it together, it's really a lot of names.

29:50.473 --> 29:52.556
Yeah, Michael Ondaatje.

29:52.796 --> 29:58.485
I wasn't able to use In the Skin of the Lines if you hadn't written it yet, but I would certainly use it.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.209
I would do it again.

30:01.229 --> 30:09.321
And examining the gothic and magical elements in their work.

30:09.892 --> 30:13.316
a wonderful writer called James Manning.

30:13.336 --> 30:17.441
He was probably not here at all.

30:17.461 --> 30:18.222
We'll say it's high right.

30:18.242 --> 30:18.502
R-A-I-N-E-Y.

30:18.963 --> 30:19.463
R-E-A-N-E-Y.

30:19.483 --> 30:23.147
The Alabamians are so high on him that they found him long distance.

30:24.609 --> 30:34.120
But the similarities, I think, are really kind of circumstantial, actually.

30:34.200 --> 30:34.360
No.

30:34.481 --> 30:37.104
I mean, you can talk about Southern writing.

30:37.124 --> 30:37.925
I'm just going to turn this.

30:37.945 --> 30:38.245
Just excuse me.
