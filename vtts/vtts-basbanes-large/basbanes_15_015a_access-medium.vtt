00:01.938 --> 00:10.430
In London, Martin Amies and myself live really not more than a few hundred yards away.

00:10.450 --> 00:15.257
So he is the laureate of this part of London where we both live.

00:15.337 --> 00:20.865
And I recognize what he writes about very well and enjoy it very much.

00:21.485 --> 00:22.647
I like his humor.

00:23.032 --> 00:28.200
his vitality, his originality, and I've read all his books.

00:28.220 --> 00:28.781
No kidding.

00:28.801 --> 00:30.644
And I'm a fan of this.

00:30.884 --> 00:35.772
I've just done a tiny little piece on the information for a magazine in England.

00:35.892 --> 00:40.178
This is one instance, I think, and I don't want to talk about him at any rate.

00:40.198 --> 00:40.679
No, no.

00:40.699 --> 00:46.027
Well, you can get him to talk about me, of course.

00:46.048 --> 00:46.448
I will.

00:48.391 --> 00:49.613
There's one instance where there's...

00:49.880 --> 00:52.042
All the hype notwithstanding, the book is good.

00:52.323 --> 00:52.983
Oh, yes.

00:53.023 --> 00:53.864
He's a real writer.

00:53.884 --> 00:55.466
He's got real originality.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.389
You get all his stuff, and then you read the book, and it's a disappointment.

00:59.190 --> 01:03.274
Well, what he's got, his intelligence is rooted in comedy.

01:03.314 --> 01:08.560
He is a real comic writer, which is not to say there's not a great deal of tragedy.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.881
There's not black comedy.

01:10.582 --> 01:18.250
And I like, personally, because I think I've tried to some extent in nonfiction to do, also to write from the comic base,

01:18.533 --> 01:25.001
I think that is the only way successfully to deal with a good deal in the 20th century.

01:25.702 --> 01:41.663
And since, as I say, he lives very close to me, I recognize what he is describing, I wouldn't quite call it describing, sending up almost, exalting him, exhilarating him.

01:42.484 --> 01:43.666
I recognize it very well.

01:44.207 --> 01:47.511
Tell me, this is... Yes, back to... But let's

01:48.166 --> 01:51.570
Why is it that you went back to this work?

01:51.590 --> 01:52.171
Tell me about that.

01:52.191 --> 01:59.319
Yes, it's nearly 30 years, pretty well 30 years since I first wrote Lit and Straight View.

01:59.339 --> 02:03.645
And when I wrote it, many people who were in the book were still alive.

02:04.265 --> 02:05.767
And in a way, that was a great advantage.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.209
I could go and see them.

02:07.229 --> 02:10.273
I could speak to them, interview them, as you're interviewing me.

02:10.293 --> 02:11.554
I get a sense of them.

02:12.455 --> 02:18.122
And I met Oswald Sidville, Bertrand Russell, Ian Forster.

02:18.558 --> 02:21.181
people who are, to some extent, legendary characters now.

02:21.782 --> 02:23.344
And that was, as I say, a great advantage.

02:23.364 --> 02:24.946
But there was a disadvantage as well.

02:25.887 --> 02:29.552
It curtailed your freedom to write about living people.

02:29.572 --> 02:30.473
And there was something else.

02:30.533 --> 02:37.062
They were old people, and they had difficulty if I asked them, where are the letters, where is this correspondence?

02:37.502 --> 02:42.008
They couldn't always find it, or perhaps they didn't wish to show it to you.

02:42.589 --> 02:47.215
Well, of course, now they are all dead, but the letters and so on,

02:47.836 --> 02:50.239
and diaries sometimes, are available.

02:50.479 --> 02:53.803
They are in public collections, sometimes in this country.

02:55.085 --> 03:05.178
So I have both the advantage of meeting a number of these people and also seeing what was written to them, by them, and about them.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.280
So that is one thing.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.886
A great deal of information

03:12.220 --> 03:18.230
that was not available when I first wrote this in the 60s has become available.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.532
And there's one other thing.

03:20.854 --> 03:23.178
The world has changed in 30 years.

03:23.799 --> 03:33.555
And so I have brought the book up to date in a different way, which is to see the past from a different angle and a different distance.

03:33.575 --> 03:38.683
And I hope to give Strachey and the Bloomsburg group generally

03:39.980 --> 03:43.403
a topical, a modern relevance.

03:44.064 --> 03:47.367
It was a book of the sixties, very much, I think.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.711
I hope it's now a book of the nineties.

03:50.811 --> 04:07.928
So do you think that that book was involved a lot of journalism in some respect, in terms of, I don't mean writing for periodicals and newspapers, but when you think of the techniques of journalism, you think writing right now involves more perspective and

04:08.330 --> 04:18.244
What I've tried to do is get the best of both worlds, of course, to give it historical perspective and topical relevance.

04:19.045 --> 04:25.614
The point about Strachey is that he didn't treat human beings as mere symptoms of the past.

04:26.395 --> 04:30.440
He thought that the past existed in all of us.

04:31.762 --> 04:36.008
We were the product of the past, and it was a living thing in us.

04:36.325 --> 04:41.270
And if we could analyze it and describe it, we would understand the course of the journey we were on.

04:41.930 --> 04:43.692
I've tried to continue that work.

04:44.653 --> 04:49.497
But my sense is that this has also been a burning thing with you.

04:49.517 --> 04:53.741
I mean, did you feel perhaps that maybe you didn't do the... Yes, I didn't do it.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.243
I didn't do it justice the first time.

04:55.283 --> 04:56.864
I was extremely young.

04:57.745 --> 05:02.109
I came to this book when I was still in my twenties.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.472
And although there are advantages...

05:05.806 --> 05:06.588
in that.

05:07.028 --> 05:08.391
There are also disadvantages.

05:08.471 --> 05:10.916
It seems to me that it all came fresh to me.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.279
It was part of my education.

05:12.319 --> 05:20.115
The whole of the Bloomsbury world, I felt like an archaeologist digging out a past and being amazed at what I discovered.

05:21.798 --> 05:24.604
But I perhaps lacked some sophistication.

05:25.827 --> 05:27.510
What I want to try and do

05:27.727 --> 05:48.840
is to combine the best of that sort of freshness that I had before with perhaps more technical know-how today and try and retain what is fresh and was fresh and vivid, I hope, and was alive in the previous book, even if it wasn't done as I do it now.

05:49.401 --> 05:55.050
There have been pages from the first version where I've said, look, I can do that better.

05:55.537 --> 05:57.039
My God, I know more than that.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.081
And I've said about it.

05:58.101 --> 06:01.467
And at the end of the day, I thought, well, I'll keep what I did.

06:02.588 --> 06:05.493
Because it had some sort of irregular beat of life to it.

06:05.874 --> 06:12.144
And although I now may put it in a more scholarly way or a more sophisticated way, perhaps it's more embalmed.

06:12.164 --> 06:16.230
So in those cases, I have kept what the young self did.

06:16.250 --> 06:22.320
I think an adjective you didn't include in what you might add in a more mature way, too.

06:26.333 --> 06:33.276
I, for one, prefer biographies written by mature people.

06:34.299 --> 06:39.837
I just think that the skills and the knowledge and everything that comes with living

06:40.458 --> 06:46.426
Yes, I was eventually embarrassed by part of my youthful work.

06:46.526 --> 06:47.847
I didn't want to say that.

06:48.048 --> 06:58.721
I was in part embarrassed, as I think perhaps if I showed you perhaps some of the letters you wrote in your teens or twenties, you might... Well, let me just say Bob Carroll, who's, you know, you're working on the St.

06:58.761 --> 07:07.913
Johnson thing, and I did a master's thesis track in the 60s when I was a kid, and Bobby Baker, who was... And Bob said, geez, that might have some stuff that I can use.

07:07.973 --> 07:08.153
Yeah.

07:08.403 --> 07:12.971
So meanwhile I went and I read this thesis, which I thought was wonderful.

07:13.071 --> 07:15.295
Jesus Christ.

07:15.755 --> 07:17.138
Exactly, exactly.

07:17.358 --> 07:19.281
You're just a little embarrassed a little bit.

07:19.381 --> 07:21.525
Indeed, that's exactly how I felt.

07:22.406 --> 07:23.809
It's not that everything was rotten.

07:24.009 --> 07:26.473
No, no, but the information is wonderful.

07:26.654 --> 07:34.647
And also there's this, that there's a tendency when you're young, or at least when I was young, for me to use three adjectives.

07:34.964 --> 07:35.985
where none would do.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.367
Perfectly well, as if we're all one.

07:39.108 --> 07:43.491
To overload, to think, well, they may not understand that I know this, and to put it in.

07:43.992 --> 07:52.359
What I think I'll say on the purpose, the miracle that I'm hoping to achieve in this book is to make it a less long book and to have much more in it.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.702
Was the first book large in it?

07:55.782 --> 07:57.904
Believe you me, it was.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.105
Believe you me, it was.

07:59.165 --> 08:00.626
It was two volumes together.

08:01.367 --> 08:04.009
And it got very good.

08:04.428 --> 08:07.874
because there was a shock element in it.

08:08.014 --> 08:11.219
People hadn't quite revealed as much of personal life.

08:11.660 --> 08:16.428
But it got, you know, the New York Times Book Review made it one of their ten books at the end of the year.

08:16.448 --> 08:25.182
I can't remember what the Boston Globe did here, but I remember the New York Review of Books, and so I gave it a really good review.

08:25.202 --> 08:27.926
George Steiner in the New Yorker, you know, gave it the lead.

08:28.287 --> 08:30.891
So I was very fortunate.

08:31.647 --> 08:35.190
But there are some people, Arthur Schlesinger, who hated it.

08:35.631 --> 08:39.814
You see, you may not trespass into people's private lives and do it in this way.

08:39.854 --> 08:50.604
This young chap going here, there, exposing this, saying that, entering a room where you haven't been invited into dinner and sitting down and dining, you know?

08:50.644 --> 08:51.845
This is bad manners.

08:52.686 --> 08:54.248
So have things changed?

08:54.268 --> 08:55.569
I'd be very interested to see.

08:55.849 --> 08:57.110
Have your perceptions changed?

08:57.130 --> 08:58.632
Have your judgments changed?

08:58.652 --> 08:59.072
Any of them?

09:00.031 --> 09:01.112
Is it a different book?

09:01.132 --> 09:03.134
Yes, there are some things that are different.

09:03.394 --> 09:16.968
I see Strachey himself as being less a sort of hippie figure that he wasn't, the progenitor of flower power and all that, and make love not war.

09:17.509 --> 09:21.713
I see him as a more subversive and challenging figure now.

09:22.494 --> 09:28.300
I think that what he tried to do is to investigate human nature in a way, which is to say...

09:28.482 --> 09:38.354
Lots of strange behavior, deviant behavior, unorthodox behavior, has been going on throughout history and is part of our heritage.

09:39.035 --> 09:40.377
And that's a very strange thing.

09:40.417 --> 09:52.712
So when he wrote about Elizabethan times or Victorian times, he stripped away a certain respectability and showed us quite discreetly how indiscreet they were.

09:53.052 --> 09:53.974
So there are two levels.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.578
Do you think perhaps you were a bit odd...

09:58.385 --> 10:25.523
by the subject yes I think I was I think the point is the everything was unpublished I came across this extraordinary archive in cellars and attics of people's houses and I was overwhelmed a bit by it it dictated to me now I hope there's a more even collaboration between me and the material and indeed some of the new material which I didn't see um

10:26.633 --> 10:30.458
Do you suggest that people read the two books?

10:31.559 --> 10:32.801
I think they read this book.

10:33.181 --> 10:34.143
I can spare them.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.925
You'd like them not to read the first book?

10:36.085 --> 10:41.732
Yes, I would, except for somebody who's a sort of textual scholar or something like that.

10:42.153 --> 10:48.381
I would prefer all libraries to get rid of the first edition and to get this.

10:48.561 --> 10:53.147
It is a better book, and there's nothing...

10:53.549 --> 10:57.635
that was in the first book that isn't in this.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.378
And there's a good deal more, as I say.

10:59.899 --> 11:02.723
And I hope done with greater sight of it.

11:02.743 --> 11:08.291
Were there any misjudgments that you're acknowledging now?

11:08.311 --> 11:08.652
Yes.

11:08.992 --> 11:16.123
I mean, I sometimes got the order of things wrong, and therefore certain things seemed to be as a consequence.

11:17.164 --> 11:20.890
And in fact, they were a cause and not a consequence.

11:21.781 --> 11:26.547
Bloomsbury went in a lot for three-cornered relationships.

11:26.567 --> 11:29.130
I had two sides of the correspondence before.

11:29.510 --> 11:30.772
Now I've got the third side.

11:30.892 --> 11:31.653
I can complete it.

11:32.033 --> 11:36.219
So it's a much more multifaceted, uh, account of things.

11:36.239 --> 11:44.869
You mentioned people, uh, you went to view... Forster and Russell... ...or now deceased.

11:45.558 --> 11:49.263
Did this liberate you in a sense to be a little bit more?

11:49.403 --> 11:54.429
Yes, I could say more about people who were alive.

11:54.449 --> 12:13.253
I can say this time more about people who were alive then, because although people were very surprisingly generous and brave, let me say, if people came to you when you were older, when you were in your 70s or 80s, and showed you things that you had done, reminded you of things you had done in your teens or twenties,

12:13.570 --> 12:21.559
and said, oh, by the way, I'm going to publish all this for the... You might... You know, it's not easy.

12:21.579 --> 12:25.383
So I will celebrate the bravery, the courage of these people, in a way.

12:25.443 --> 12:30.228
Painters, philosophers, poets.

12:30.248 --> 12:32.350
It's not easy to have a young child coming along.

12:32.370 --> 12:35.634
We always remember, you know, as they say, the forest.

12:35.854 --> 12:38.357
Yes, that's true.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.219
Is this kind of a...

12:42.376 --> 12:45.180
for you a similar kind of thing that you really, this was a first book?

12:45.901 --> 12:46.782
Yeah.

12:46.802 --> 12:50.847
It was something... Maybe there's something there that says, I've got to go back and square this away.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.149
That is absolutely right.

12:53.191 --> 13:05.006
It was... I was both overruled by doing this book, which is... It took me nearly eight years, the same as you have taken over yours.

13:06.969 --> 13:12.096
But the extra two years or three years that I've spent doing this,

13:12.667 --> 13:22.496
has made me able to look at the book again and say, that's it, to say that I've done it sort of honourably now.

13:22.816 --> 13:26.579
Beforehand, I was sort of beginning to slink past the bookshops guiltily.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.821
I was embarrassed by parts of it.

13:30.162 --> 13:31.243
I think it had life.

13:31.924 --> 13:33.025
I think it had life.

13:33.445 --> 13:38.450
It wasn't a dead book, but it was a deformed book.

13:40.251 --> 13:41.392
Pretty nice.

13:41.412 --> 13:42.133
That's what I think.

13:42.417 --> 13:47.185
And yet, as you have already pointed out, it was very well received.

13:47.205 --> 13:48.067
It was very well received.

13:48.087 --> 13:48.968
It was still in print.

13:49.389 --> 13:50.631
I had to put it out of print.

13:50.671 --> 13:51.993
I had to buy back the rights.

13:52.053 --> 13:52.995
So you affirm it.

13:53.235 --> 14:00.107
I actually went to my publishers, and you won't get many scenes like this, and said, they said, we're going to do a new edition, a new reprint of it.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.650
And I said, don't.

14:02.271 --> 14:04.474
Put it out of print.

14:04.534 --> 14:04.915
Now...

14:05.097 --> 14:06.879
That's a very strange situation.

14:06.939 --> 14:08.781
Normally you get authors begging them.

14:11.044 --> 14:13.707
Indeed, indeed.

14:13.907 --> 14:17.471
Dr. Oh killed one of his early books in Spain.

14:17.491 --> 14:21.035
Yes, I mean we all... Indeed, indeed.

14:21.075 --> 14:23.898
But this is rather different.

14:24.359 --> 14:27.322
I wanted to resurrect it.

14:28.003 --> 14:28.664
I wanted to resurrect it.

14:28.684 --> 14:29.365
Give it a new life.

14:29.545 --> 14:30.366
Give it a new life.

14:30.586 --> 14:31.527
Were you thinking about it

14:31.777 --> 14:33.339
about it at all during the night.

14:33.379 --> 14:35.141
You were involved, how long on the shop project?

14:35.281 --> 14:36.062
Fifteen years.

14:37.283 --> 14:39.345
There must have been times when you thought that would never end.

14:39.766 --> 14:40.747
Yes, there were.

14:40.767 --> 14:47.775
It was like a marathon, that shore, in which you're running alone, because, as you know, authors write alone.

14:48.656 --> 14:52.180
How many people they interview, they've got to come back to their desk and do it alone.

14:52.200 --> 14:57.866
The little red light is on, by the way, right?

14:57.886 --> 15:00.549
Yep, it's fine.

15:00.569 --> 15:01.530
No, no, of course.

15:01.763 --> 15:05.709
Um, and I wondered whether in that marathon I had perhaps taken a wrong turning.

15:06.490 --> 15:10.216
And I was running along by myself, still running, a bit out of breath sometimes.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.519
But was I, had I taken a wrong, was I on course?

15:12.679 --> 15:14.101
Was there a winning day, if any were?

15:14.141 --> 15:18.027
So it was, and I was out of touch with the reading public for a long time.

15:18.869 --> 15:22.013
I mean, I did some other things and so on, but this is my main work.

15:22.875 --> 15:31.247
So, but it, the Strachey, which really had, uh, established me as a biographer, um,

15:31.970 --> 15:50.756
and in a way that was very particular since I was writing about a biographer, and a biographer who had, in the early part of this century, revolutionized the art of biography and rescued it from Victorian respectability, shall we say.

15:51.817 --> 16:00.289
So I wanted to carry on that torch, and it niggled me that I'd done it partly, but the torch...

16:00.640 --> 16:03.864
spluttered and gone out a bit and come on and gone off.

16:04.184 --> 16:08.870
I wanted to do it better, just simply better.

16:08.991 --> 16:22.468
Do you believe, as many people do, that major figures like Shaw, like Shakespeare, of course, require a new evaluation, a new biographical look with succeeding generations?

16:22.488 --> 16:23.148
Yes, I do.

16:23.168 --> 16:25.171
That there's no such thing as a definitive life?

16:25.411 --> 16:28.335
I believe this very strongly.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.399
there is no such thing as a divinity of life.

16:31.479 --> 16:37.985
Not in the sense that someone is going to discover a new postcard and therefore have one new fact.

16:38.025 --> 16:38.946
It isn't quite that.

16:39.427 --> 16:43.490
It is that the past is always changing.

16:44.351 --> 16:48.535
The past is changing as we re-evaluate it.

16:48.915 --> 16:54.820
And as we re-evaluate it, the figures in it occupy different positions regarding ourselves.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.702
We can get a relative truth

16:57.408 --> 17:00.352
We may not get an absolute truth.

17:00.392 --> 17:05.359
We can get absolute facts, but even they need interpretation.

17:06.080 --> 17:09.245
And they are much more complicated than we think facts nowadays.

17:09.305 --> 17:15.314
For example, I can say something to you that isn't true, but it is a fact that I've said it.

17:15.334 --> 17:22.244
I can have a dream, but that dream isn't true, but it's a fact that I dreamed it.

17:23.265 --> 17:25.288
I can take a decision on something.

17:25.792 --> 17:28.294
But not 100% of myself takes.

17:28.374 --> 17:33.640
If there's a lingering element, perhaps only 75% of myself took that decision on what to do.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.683
And there's a 25% regret.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.925
And that colors what I do.

17:39.325 --> 17:52.418
So things are much more subtle these days in the way that we evaluate, describe, recreate the past.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.820
Is Strachey the type of individual...

17:55.205 --> 18:01.732
but does he have the stature, you think, that will require constantly evaluation?

18:01.752 --> 18:04.995
Well, I think that he will, really for two reasons.

18:05.115 --> 18:06.957
I think his life was so extraordinary.

18:06.977 --> 18:08.499
Oh, we can certainly say that about Shaw.

18:08.599 --> 18:10.200
Oh, yes, there's no question about Shaw.

18:10.601 --> 18:11.081
Exactly.

18:11.121 --> 18:24.435
The case I would make for Strachey is partly that no biographer writing today, I think, will deny that he...

18:24.787 --> 18:29.513
really changed biography quite profoundly.

18:29.833 --> 18:44.430
And therefore, whether you love him or hate him, honour him or react against him, you have to say that he had a great influence on the writing of life, and by one extension, on life itself.

18:45.532 --> 18:53.241
Partly an essential role in the Bloomsbury Group, which had this philosophy of putting...

18:54.605 --> 18:56.587
Private values over public values.

18:56.827 --> 19:13.946
Human relationships, the ability to recognize beauty in music and art, to place that higher than political careerism and public ambition is a sort of philosophy that is very interesting, I think.

19:14.627 --> 19:23.717
And I think that his story, the story of his life, and the extraordinary love affair with Carrington,

19:24.406 --> 19:27.331
which occupied 16 years of both their lives.

19:28.172 --> 19:39.271
No one interested in human nature can fail to be interested in that story, which, of course, as you possibly know, is now a film.

19:39.371 --> 19:43.798
It's going to open in the Cannes Film Festival later this month.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.632
Ah, it comes from this book, yes, indeed.

19:46.712 --> 19:48.234
No, no, no, this is the book.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.519
Do you get some kind of... Yes, I do, I'm glad to say.

19:51.599 --> 20:12.570
In fact, what has suddenly happened is that film people have woken up to what I would call a fact, but as you know, facts are... to the fact that my work is filmable, because what I try to do is to tell a non-fiction scholarly research

20:14.170 --> 20:22.823
story, narrative, so that you get information, certainly, but you also wish to turn the page about it.

20:22.843 --> 20:24.164
What the hell happens next?

20:24.906 --> 20:36.783
So they're now talking to people who made The Madness of King George, that film, the producer, wants to film my biography of Augustus John, which is coming.

20:36.803 --> 20:41.089
So I now find myself rather late in life,

20:41.170 --> 20:47.901
with a secondary career, which is quite powerful.

20:47.921 --> 20:57.177
I have a chapter in here about this fellow who stole 25,000 rare books from 275 universities all over the United States.

20:57.497 --> 20:58.319
It's a big story.

20:58.719 --> 21:00.002
I went to his trial.

21:00.763 --> 21:01.604
I interviewed him.

21:02.265 --> 21:03.387
He was the only person.

21:03.427 --> 21:05.511
His defense was insanity.

21:05.671 --> 21:06.773
It was a wonderful story.

21:07.276 --> 21:14.184
And the stuff was worth twenty million dollars, and he stole it to keep it, because he loved it.

21:15.665 --> 21:19.229
And he has been approached by a number of people for movies and stuff.

21:20.370 --> 21:20.951
And he doesn't want to do it.

21:20.971 --> 21:21.872
He's still in prison.

21:22.813 --> 21:24.355
But I mean, I've got the whole story here.

21:24.375 --> 21:25.996
That's fascinating, you see.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.500
And I'm wondering, because if it's public record, if they could just take it from me.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.923
This has always been the difficulty.

21:32.003 --> 21:36.608
But there is a case in Britain where

21:37.583 --> 21:53.919
I think it was John Osborne was involved in making a film script of a piece of history that had been written by Cecil Wood of Swift, and they took her book, The Charge of the Light Brigade, it was.

21:54.580 --> 22:01.287
And it was proved that they had based it so closely on her book that she was due... Exactly, the rights.

22:01.407 --> 22:05.751
And in this, I mean, Christopher Hampton, who's done the script,

22:06.068 --> 22:10.336
is happy to acknowledge that and to do a contract.

22:10.356 --> 22:15.084
It's so easy to do, and it's not really a great deal of money.

22:16.046 --> 22:20.133
No, it's having a proper status, and so on.

22:20.333 --> 22:21.956
I think people should.

22:22.357 --> 22:27.205
Writers should behave, whatever genre of writing, properly to be one another.

22:27.746 --> 22:30.912
You mentioned writing scholarly

22:31.482 --> 22:37.289
but nevertheless excessively written non-fiction.

22:37.309 --> 22:42.335
Do you have a sense of biography as literary work?

22:42.355 --> 22:43.376
Yes, I do now.

22:43.696 --> 23:01.017
I think that if I was to describe Strachey as the enfant terrible of modern biography, I would then say that he came to maturity with people like Richard Ellman, George Painter, in the late 1950s.

23:01.402 --> 23:08.509
And that since then, we have been going through a golden age of biography, the second golden age of biography.

23:08.529 --> 23:10.451
The first was with Johnson and Boswell.

23:12.553 --> 23:14.355
And it's a very strange genre.

23:14.415 --> 23:16.117
It's a hybrid, really.

23:18.079 --> 23:20.841
Johnson was a very moralist, of course, and a poet.

23:21.902 --> 23:30.531
And Boswell was a great adventurer and a keeper of a great journal, hence that connection between journalists and biography.

23:31.085 --> 23:42.559
And I see a great deal of good writing, really good writing, by genuine writers now taking place in that form of non-fiction.

23:42.920 --> 23:47.365
And it's been a very exciting time to write biographies now.

23:47.385 --> 23:54.374
And so my favorites, of course, and it just seems that so many of the really fine biographies are about writers.

23:54.715 --> 23:55.436
Yes, they are.

23:55.516 --> 23:56.637
And I wonder why that is.

23:56.802 --> 23:57.363
I don't know.

23:57.623 --> 23:58.544
I think it is this.

23:58.644 --> 24:00.085
I have a theory about it.

24:00.385 --> 24:13.677
Is that a literary biographer invites the subject, who is also a considerable writer normally, to write one more book posthumously and in collaboration.

24:14.578 --> 24:18.462
And, you know, and so that's the past and the present.

24:18.842 --> 24:21.644
And it's so satisfactory if it works.

24:21.684 --> 24:23.166
It's like a good marriage, as it were.

24:23.186 --> 24:24.547
You can't tell if it's going to work.

24:24.567 --> 24:25.628
And there are stories of

24:25.928 --> 24:30.834
people coming together, it seemed to be so promising, and then the love affair turns out.

24:30.854 --> 24:32.657
It's been so much a good way to know.

24:32.677 --> 24:33.218
Yes, it has.

24:33.238 --> 24:34.539
Just in the last year, I mean.

24:34.559 --> 24:37.423
I don't know if you had a chance to read the Balzheimer.

24:37.984 --> 24:38.745
Wonderful book.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.367
It's absolutely a wonderful book.

24:40.567 --> 24:41.308
Wonderful book.

24:41.348 --> 24:44.953
We just got one in yesterday on Zola, which looks nice.

24:45.494 --> 24:54.265
No, it's the most wonderful time to be writing this, and the benchmark is going up all the time.

24:55.122 --> 24:56.403
It's really very good, I think.

24:56.423 --> 24:58.946
Now, what are you working on next?

24:59.146 --> 25:10.156
Well, I've only just finished that, but I think I shall be doing for Augustus John what I've done for this, because a lot of papers have come to life, which were smuggled out.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.418
So I'm rewriting it.

25:12.699 --> 25:19.085
But I've been asked to write the official biography of Doris Lessing.

25:20.466 --> 25:23.028
But that's probably... Oh, really?

25:23.108 --> 25:24.910
That's probably...

25:25.177 --> 25:30.546
Not my next book, but my last book, and conceivably, for both of us, a Bostemus book.

25:31.307 --> 25:32.849
Well, isn't it interesting?

25:33.210 --> 25:42.184
She said one reason she is writing these memoirs is because she understood that she said she gave the figure five people were working on them.

25:42.244 --> 25:47.112
And she's also now using my name to threaten them with a no.

25:48.594 --> 25:52.020
So things that she cannot... But she said the reason she's doing this is to get it right.

25:52.140 --> 25:52.821
Absolutely.

25:53.071 --> 25:54.053
Well, that's one thing.

25:54.113 --> 26:09.497
There is another point, that you'll get it right up to a point, but there are things that she cannot quite say while she and some other people are alive that she will put in a suitcase or whatever things to one side for me.

26:09.557 --> 26:10.999
I'm sure you'll agree with this.

26:11.019 --> 26:15.145
I think Justin Kaplan and David McCullough as well.

26:15.366 --> 26:16.768
Justin Kaplan, wonderful.

26:16.928 --> 26:17.349
It's great.

26:17.369 --> 26:21.255
And they both said, you know, when you embark on a biography of somebody,

26:21.674 --> 26:26.060
The first thing you want to read is their own autobiographical.

26:26.120 --> 26:32.610
They say, because what they don't say about themselves is very often just as important as what they do say about themselves.

26:32.630 --> 26:33.270
Absolutely.

26:33.651 --> 26:46.669
And very often, I mean, I found this with Shaw, for example, because he was asked to give accounts of himself later in life when he was famous, he would write long letters to people saying, I did this, this, this, and this.

26:46.730 --> 26:51.276
And it's tremendously convincing, and it's readable, and it's

26:51.712 --> 27:21.077
got tremendous power and then you read what he wrote at the time and you see there are differences and so there would be with all of us we edit out things we forget things and so what you want to do is to plot what people wrote at the time with what they wrote later and then sometimes with what people wrote about them or to them and so it's multifaceted again there are many strands to it and if you can weave them together in a pattern

27:21.597 --> 27:26.743
so that they have a sort of resonance and structure.

27:27.164 --> 27:35.253
Then it becomes part of literature because it has an imaginative as well as a factual quality.

27:35.273 --> 27:39.658
Now, you started work as a biographer as a youngster, really.

27:39.678 --> 27:40.700
Yes, indeed, indeed.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.141
That's so unusual, isn't it?

27:42.161 --> 27:46.026
Very unusual, and it came through really a succession of accidents.

27:47.408 --> 27:50.271
Many things do come as a result of accidents, I think.

27:50.555 --> 27:58.286
I really had been, at school I'd studied the sciences, not literature or anything.

27:58.907 --> 28:13.007
But that was my father's idea, because we had no money, and he saw from the advertisements in newspapers that the future lay with structural engineers and so on.

28:13.027 --> 28:16.512
The trouble is I didn't have any gifts for this, especially in mathematics.

28:17.217 --> 28:20.181
And so at a certain stage, I passed some exams.

28:20.221 --> 28:21.622
I said, look, I can't go on with this.

28:22.183 --> 28:24.226
And I argued with him late into the night.

28:24.987 --> 28:26.048
And he suddenly had a brainwave.

28:26.068 --> 28:30.053
He said, look, you can revive the family fortunes by going into the law.

28:30.373 --> 28:33.898
And when you argue each case as passionately as they'll actually pay you for it.

28:34.438 --> 28:37.162
So I then went to study law.

28:37.182 --> 28:43.950
But what I discovered was that I was bored to tears by a lot of law except for criminal law.

28:44.521 --> 28:47.145
Now, criminal law is not interested in law.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.750
It's interested in human beings, in human nature.

28:50.471 --> 28:51.873
So I gave that up.

28:51.933 --> 28:55.920
And then there was the military service in Britain.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.502
So I had to do two years in that.

28:57.943 --> 29:04.113
And I think that persuaded everybody who saw me that I was not a natural soldier, shall we say.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.659
So I was totting up a list of disqualifications.

29:08.420 --> 29:09.482
I was a reader.

29:10.070 --> 29:18.103
And it seemed to me, I'd been brought up largely by grandparents, that a great deal more was happening in other people's lives than in my own, and perhaps a little more successful.

29:18.343 --> 29:20.527
I got more and more interested in people.

29:21.047 --> 29:23.491
And that's really how it came about.

29:23.531 --> 29:29.982
And what I discovered is that a lot of people who become reasonably successful, don't have that easy beginning.

29:30.462 --> 29:32.085
Don't have... It isn't obvious.

29:32.926 --> 29:33.968
Things are...

29:35.315 --> 29:37.757
Well, they would astonish their parents, shall we say.

29:38.157 --> 29:41.040
Now, you're married to a woman who's quite a wonderful novel.

29:41.100 --> 29:41.741
That's true.

29:41.801 --> 29:48.927
And her muse really inspires the imagination.

29:48.967 --> 29:52.270
You haven't been motivated in those areas.

29:52.290 --> 29:57.534
Well, years before I met her, I did write one novel.

29:57.655 --> 29:57.975
Really?

29:59.436 --> 29:59.997
Published?

30:00.097 --> 30:03.340
Yes, published in the States, not in Britain.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.300
What title, might I add?

30:04.320 --> 30:05.001
A Dog's Life.

30:05.369 --> 30:07.833
It was published by Holt in the 60s.

30:08.935 --> 30:12.360
And the fact was that I was sued for libel.

30:13.842 --> 30:22.315
Now, it seemed rather curious that one should be sued for libel for one's fiction, and not so much for one's non-fiction.

30:22.335 --> 30:28.525
And the criticism, really, of me was that my novel was too sort of documentary.

30:28.842 --> 30:33.589
Whereas perhaps my non-fiction reads too much like a story, like a novel.

30:33.649 --> 30:35.892
Was it based on the life of an actor?

30:35.912 --> 30:38.476
Well, it was partly based on my own family.

30:38.576 --> 30:44.645
But although I disguised things, one member of the family said that he was... He assumed by a member of the family?

30:45.326 --> 30:45.887
My father.

30:46.768 --> 30:48.190
But he never took it to the court.

30:48.630 --> 30:51.755
But I think now... Let me say this.

30:52.035 --> 30:55.721
I don't think it was that wonderful a novel, and I think I actually am grateful to it.

30:56.882 --> 30:58.765
So all my desires

30:59.032 --> 31:10.005
to write fiction, have really gone into the narrative devices that I have borrowed from novelists to write non-fiction.

31:10.205 --> 31:11.667
You've got to even borrow things.

31:11.747 --> 31:23.100
I think the biographers these days have stolen some of, or borrowed some of the magic fire, shall we say, of novelists, where novelists go to non-fiction for a lot of their raw material.

31:23.160 --> 31:27.184
So it's a cross-fertilization which is very healthy for literature.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.566
Exactly, exactly.

31:28.985 --> 31:37.974
Because I'm writing for so many more newspapers now than I was when we saw it, a lot of us, some things almost fear.

31:39.075 --> 31:40.617
Ah, yeah, yeah, indeed, indeed, indeed.

31:40.637 --> 31:51.969
I remember you once talked about the working, if you could describe it this way, the working relationship that you have with your wife, that I think that you actually write in different parts of town.

31:52.069 --> 31:52.529
Yes, we do.

31:52.549 --> 31:58.215
We're 20 minutes apart from one another, and one of the reasons for this is that however sympathetic you are to another person,

31:58.887 --> 32:05.534
You create around you while you are writing something like a magnetic field of concentration.

32:06.275 --> 32:18.768
And just to have somebody else on the premises with a completely different magnetic field of concentration means that you are always aware, not in any obvious way, of someone else pounding away at this or doing that.

32:19.148 --> 32:27.257
And it's much better to separate yourself while you're working and then come together together

32:27.490 --> 32:29.713
When you put that, the finals will stop for the day.

32:30.454 --> 32:31.575
Do you look at each other's work?

32:32.096 --> 32:42.269
No, except for under very special circumstances, where it's felt that there's a particular thing that the other person can help with very specifically.

32:42.930 --> 32:48.698
On the whole, you have to worry things out by yourself and get them on the page.

32:48.758 --> 32:52.823
The way that we help one another is by lifting each other's morale.

32:53.157 --> 33:03.329
of suddenly seeing that one person is rather down in the dumps and saying, right, we'll go out and see a film, we'll go out and do this, we'll go away for the weekend, we'll give ourselves more energy.

33:03.550 --> 33:06.433
And that is very helpful, one to another.

33:06.453 --> 33:18.248
Occasionally we will discuss things, but I think it's sometimes dangerous for a writer to discuss a book while that book is in the process of creation, where it's being written.

33:18.808 --> 33:19.970
You have to do it.

33:20.010 --> 33:22.573
That's why it's rather lonely business.

33:22.756 --> 33:23.697
on the page.

33:24.218 --> 33:29.364
I know people who are very gifted, who've talked away their books.

33:29.544 --> 33:38.734
They're extremely entertaining in the evening to have dinner with, and yet the book either doesn't get written or is disappointing.

33:38.794 --> 33:40.216
It's not so good as what you heard.

33:40.396 --> 33:42.559
Look at Truman Capote's book that never was.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.022
Talked about it for all those years.

33:45.162 --> 33:46.283
Very good examples.

33:46.381 --> 33:47.622
That's exactly what I mean.

33:47.862 --> 33:51.926
And then finally, when they looked at it, the sludge of it, nothing here.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.147
Did he actually write anything?

33:53.588 --> 33:57.952
He probably was a very, very, very entertaining program.

33:57.972 --> 33:59.754
And that's, you know... They were scared of it.

33:59.774 --> 34:01.255
People were saying, what's this book?

34:01.295 --> 34:02.636
They couldn't wait to see what we have.

34:02.817 --> 34:04.078
As it turned out, there was nothing there.

34:04.118 --> 34:04.779
Nothing there.

34:05.820 --> 34:08.502
Well, I think we're both very aware of that.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.364
There will be a special circumstances.

34:10.424 --> 34:14.768
There was something when Margaret needed something...

34:15.068 --> 34:20.315
when I was able to give her something from my family, which worked in the plot, just the paper.

34:20.335 --> 34:21.557
What about the technical things?

34:21.637 --> 34:24.000
Yes.

34:24.161 --> 34:24.721
Exactly.

34:25.823 --> 34:37.840
But what is interesting is that Margaret has turned biographer, and she has just completed, this month, a biography of the English novelist Angus Wilson.

34:37.860 --> 34:39.942
And it's going to be a very good book.

34:40.463 --> 34:41.785
But, she said to me,

34:42.085 --> 34:44.027
Never again, biography.

34:44.067 --> 34:47.010
You never told me what hell it was.

34:47.831 --> 34:51.856
And as you and I know, it is hell.

34:53.177 --> 34:55.340
Well, exactly.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.422
I would love to do a biography, actually.

34:57.442 --> 34:58.183
Yeah, yeah.

34:58.203 --> 35:00.385
But I feel that this is almost practice.

35:02.107 --> 35:03.428
Yes, indeed.

35:03.529 --> 35:04.670
What I need is a subject.

35:04.750 --> 35:05.451
You need, yes.

35:05.891 --> 35:09.115
Well, a subject will select you at one third.

35:09.135 --> 35:09.375
Thank you.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.248
They sometimes select you rather than them, you know.

35:12.268 --> 35:13.229
You're the other way around.

35:13.329 --> 35:23.683
You mentioned that you work 20 minutes apart just for... For reasons of... Just give me an idea where... No, no, no.

35:24.043 --> 35:25.845
She's more in Hampstead.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.409
I am in Notting Hill.

35:29.190 --> 35:33.155
And although... These are separate residences, are they?

35:33.255 --> 35:37.641
At the moment, well, they started out as separate residences, yes, because when we married...

35:37.891 --> 35:42.623
she had three children, and she had the Oxford Companion of English Literature, which filled rooms.

35:42.864 --> 35:47.335
I had Shaw, in my play, which I can tell you, well, I don't have to tell you.

35:47.776 --> 35:51.867
And there wasn't sort of a room during the day times.

35:52.218 --> 35:56.104
So we retained those, but she's now selling her place and so on.

35:56.384 --> 35:58.728
But we do work away.

35:58.768 --> 36:01.251
In the old days, she took an hostage.

36:01.271 --> 36:02.894
Do you both work in the daytime?

36:03.054 --> 36:04.476
Yes, we tend to work in the daytime.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.878
She's got a slightly different clock.

36:05.898 --> 36:11.026
She's about an hour earlier than I am, and I work an hour later, but that's not a hymn of that.

36:11.046 --> 36:14.230
I did an interview with John Keegan last fall.

36:14.251 --> 36:17.996
He was quite an interesting guy.

36:18.016 --> 36:19.699
He said a very interesting thing.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.381
When he was writing the things of battle,

36:22.019 --> 36:27.405
You say you almost entered a zone where, where, and, and, you know, you feel this.

36:27.425 --> 36:27.865
Yes, you do.

36:27.885 --> 36:31.088
You can't even remember almost what you're doing, but you're doing it.

36:31.108 --> 36:34.092
And I wonder if it's a similar kind of... Very much so, very much so.

36:34.132 --> 36:43.241
When writing The Strachey, I got so involved in The Strachey-Carrington Love Affair that, um, people who were interested in me were quite jealous of the dead.

36:45.664 --> 36:48.887
I, it really took over my imagination.

36:49.340 --> 37:09.558
In a way, to some extent, it may be a superficial parallel, but a biographer is to some extent like an actor who puts on the clothes of the subject, learns the lines, takes on the part for some of the time, becomes, so far as the audience is concerned, that person for some of the time.

37:09.698 --> 37:17.305
Of course there's the other thing where you have to then take off the clothes and look at the performance and judge it as a critic.

37:17.690 --> 37:21.016
But you do lose yourself, apparently.

37:21.116 --> 37:28.249
And that, to me, is one of the fascinations of Barclay, to take a holiday from oneself.

37:28.269 --> 37:30.834
You know, I think we've done it in an hour.

37:31.355 --> 37:32.457
God, yes, yes, yes.

37:32.717 --> 37:38.247
Well, it's very charming and good to speak to someone who...
