00:02.697 --> 00:32.367
For us to be successful, for any group to be successful, you do have to be very, very persistent and do have to be constantly working to inform and educate people as to what you are attempting to do and how it will benefit everyone, including that administrator and...

00:32.752 --> 00:40.504
One official I'm told has said, how do you explain the success along the natural river?

00:41.546 --> 00:45.753
And to use the cliche, when it seems appropriate, it's the squeaky wheel against the grease.

00:45.953 --> 00:47.876
Yeah, that's right.

00:47.896 --> 00:50.640
Do you think that's applicable in this case?

00:50.660 --> 00:51.762
Oh, yes, we do.

00:51.782 --> 00:57.211
We use that saying often.

00:57.832 --> 00:58.573
And...

01:00.022 --> 01:14.757
It is definitely the squeaky wheel that gets the grease of the oil, but also the larger the wheel, the more oil it will get.

01:14.973 --> 01:22.222
And so we have realized in the beginning the importance of numbers.

01:22.242 --> 01:23.503
So how do you get numbers?

01:23.583 --> 01:27.207
And again, maybe this comes to the organizational ability that you have.

01:27.228 --> 01:27.408
It does.

01:27.428 --> 01:27.528
Yeah.

01:28.028 --> 01:37.219
One of the things I'm going to give you, Nick, is a little story that was written up by a friend of mine who was the secretary of our group.

01:37.239 --> 01:39.462
And it's called, How Do You Clean Up a River?

01:40.117 --> 01:42.140
You know, that's funny.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.826
I was thinking of starting my story with the same thing.

01:45.946 --> 01:46.227
Yeah.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.034
Excuse me for moving that.

01:51.175 --> 01:54.219
Can I borrow this and copy it?

01:54.239 --> 01:55.081
Yeah, you can have it.

01:55.401 --> 01:56.663
I guess it's the first line.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.246
How do you clean up a river?

01:58.266 --> 01:59.848
Oh, thank God I saw this.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.271
I'm serious.

02:01.611 --> 02:03.795
You know, it's the natural line.

02:04.215 --> 02:04.656
Yeah.

02:05.952 --> 02:18.452
And she does describe in some detail, and I re-read it just before you came, and how you do, how we went about cleaning up her river and how we organized.

02:19.353 --> 02:19.954
Well, that's good.

02:20.174 --> 02:30.571
Yeah, and so I don't know whether you want me to discuss this with you, because I think everything that I might tell you was in there in some more detail.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.175
Well, this will be excellent background.

02:33.880 --> 02:53.087
And there's something else that may be of use to, and I keep thinking and saying that we should update this, but we, several years ago, again, this is very old, we clipped newspaper articles that were most pertinent to our efforts.

02:54.670 --> 02:57.193
And it really gives you a rundown.

02:57.213 --> 03:00.437
If I could borrow this, I'll copy it and mail it back to you.

03:00.677 --> 03:01.438
I'll bring it back to you.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.260
Because we'll probably want to come up and take some pictures.

03:03.360 --> 03:03.901
Okay.

03:04.061 --> 03:06.884
Well, I get a kick out of this one.

03:06.904 --> 03:09.667
These are my two sons.

03:09.908 --> 03:15.254
The pictures were taken about ten years ago, and they're really big boys now.

03:15.294 --> 03:16.535
They're young men.

03:17.576 --> 03:19.959
But that's funny.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.382
When the river...

03:22.970 --> 03:24.412
Well, that was in 66.

03:25.012 --> 03:36.806
In the mid-60s, the river was so putrid that people, I don't know who they were, just people would put up these signs like that one, Nashville Riverhead.

03:36.886 --> 03:40.330
There's another sign over in Eyre and Shirley.

03:40.351 --> 03:44.596
It said, Nazis River.

03:45.236 --> 03:47.799
You know, it crossed out Nashville.

03:47.819 --> 03:48.420
But...

03:49.312 --> 03:56.218
Well, at the point this was written, which is 1970, would you say the river went as well on its way to being saved at that point?

03:56.959 --> 03:59.141
Yes, not everyone recognized it.

03:59.301 --> 04:03.425
I think people felt that we were overly optimistic.

04:03.785 --> 04:15.916
I know they did, because recently I've talked with people who have said to me, well, you know, I wasn't with you then, but I am with you now.

04:15.996 --> 04:17.417
And I said, well, what do you mean?

04:17.437 --> 04:18.458
And he said, well...

04:19.400 --> 04:23.907
I used not to think that it was possible to clean up the river.

04:24.688 --> 04:38.209
And I found then that people, that a lot of people didn't support the cleanup effort because they thought it was an impossible task and no one wants to associate themselves with something that isn't going to be successful.

04:38.729 --> 04:39.731
Yeah, right.

04:39.771 --> 04:41.874
That's the American way.

04:41.894 --> 04:44.779
I mean, we want it to be British.

04:44.799 --> 04:44.899
Yeah.

04:44.919 --> 04:45.019
Yeah.

04:45.303 --> 05:01.027
But in the very beginning, what we tried to do was not to point our finger at someone or like into an industry and say, you are a bad, polluting industry, and to really shake the stick at them.

05:01.047 --> 05:07.797
But rather, we have worked to gain their interest and their support and their cooperation.

05:08.579 --> 05:13.386
And we have felt from the very beginning that it was not possible

05:14.024 --> 05:24.882
for us to be successful, to restore the river and establish the greenway, unless we had the interest and support of everyone.

05:24.922 --> 05:29.530
And so when we first organized... So is this a public relations problem?

05:31.253 --> 05:32.515
I don't see it as a problem.

05:32.535 --> 05:37.744
I mean, what some people call... It's a public relations challenge, a public relations exercise.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.407
I think maybe...

05:42.037 --> 05:45.143
I always like to use the word opportunity.

05:45.243 --> 05:55.821
I always, almost invariably, will substitute the word opportunity for problem, or use the word challenge, but opportunity.

05:56.543 --> 06:05.158
And so when we first organized

06:05.459 --> 06:11.985
the Watershed Association and set up our board of directors.

06:12.286 --> 06:24.297
One of the first directors we had was Don Crocker, who was the general manager of a warehouser company.

06:24.317 --> 06:32.445
And I felt that in the beginning, industries were really, really supportive.

06:33.438 --> 06:34.519
They weren't supportive.

06:34.539 --> 06:39.063
Well, no, all right, not at the very beginning, but they became supportive.

06:39.083 --> 06:43.287
And we worked hard to get their support.

06:43.307 --> 06:47.470
In the beginning... Well, they were supportive.

06:48.471 --> 06:52.595
Were they supportive when they recognized how much money it might cost them?

06:52.615 --> 06:56.318
Their share of the sewage treatment plants?

06:57.039 --> 07:00.181
Which is considerable, right?

07:00.201 --> 07:01.943
Yeah, but now let's take...

07:02.463 --> 07:13.220
Warehouser, for example, they were the largest company, the biggest looter to the river at one time when we first organized.

07:14.582 --> 07:23.757
But they were already taking some measures of their own to treat some of their waste.

07:24.738 --> 07:26.361
But they weren't sure whether

07:26.898 --> 07:36.490
they should go ahead with that or not because federal legislation was just being established then in 1965, the Federal Water Quality Act.

07:36.510 --> 07:54.593
And they then saw the handwriting on the... They then saw that it might be better for them to wait until the federal legislation was passed and...

07:55.315 --> 08:11.235
and requirements were set for industries to abate their pollution because those requirements, well, pretty surely were going to be different from what they were doing.

08:12.437 --> 08:15.100
I have a question.

08:15.120 --> 08:20.567
Obviously a lot of this needed federal money, right?

08:20.587 --> 08:22.910
How did you get federal money?

08:23.471 --> 08:23.871
Okay.

08:24.374 --> 08:28.720
How about maybe we can detail what it was used for?

08:28.761 --> 08:30.804
I think I know it.

08:30.824 --> 08:32.967
Okay, well, there were a bunch of... I'm curious about how you get it.

08:32.987 --> 08:35.250
Maybe, again, it goes back to the squeaky wheel.

08:35.270 --> 08:37.714
Yeah, well, a lot of happy coincidences.

08:37.734 --> 08:46.467
I mean, the Federal Water Quality Act of 1965 was absolutely key to the...

08:48.320 --> 09:10.193
restoration of the Nashua and any river for that matter because it made federal monies available substantial federal monies available for the first time to municipalities and to industries too if they would join in with a municipal treatment facility and

09:11.219 --> 09:23.316
If the Better Water Quality Act of 1965 or some similar legislation had not been passed, we could not have been successful.

09:23.336 --> 09:24.638
It's as basic as that.

09:24.658 --> 09:25.179
Oh, yeah.

09:25.199 --> 09:33.471
All the other projects and the getting the green light, they would have been incidental.

09:33.491 --> 09:35.233
I mean, it would have been a nice try, but you had to have that money.

09:35.253 --> 09:38.037
Well, to clean up the river, to clean up the river...

09:38.422 --> 09:46.035
There definitely had to be state and federal monies invested.

09:46.435 --> 09:52.005
How much finally do you think that you got?

09:52.025 --> 09:54.288
How much were you able to get?

09:54.308 --> 10:04.345
Well, right now the federal government is paying about 90% of the, let's see, 80, 90.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.067
Normally, that's the... About 90%.

10:10.167 --> 10:16.493
Yeah, they're paying about 90% of the cost of construction.

10:17.554 --> 10:25.261
And I think Fitchburg was successful in getting back, yes, they were, those monies.

10:25.961 --> 10:33.488
So I would say that 90% of the construction costs have been made available by federal monies.

10:34.749 --> 10:35.850
And...

10:37.147 --> 10:50.640
with federal money, and then the state has been coming forward with... Okay, but as you say, there were a lot of happy coincidences.

10:50.660 --> 10:50.840
Okay.

10:51.260 --> 10:57.146
However, so the money was made available, or at least it was possible to get some money.

10:57.246 --> 10:58.627
How did you get it?

10:58.687 --> 11:01.530
How did the Nashville get it, say, in the Merrimack River?

11:01.550 --> 11:02.911
I'm from Lowell originally.

11:03.091 --> 11:03.272
Okay.

11:03.732 --> 11:05.854
That means it needs a lot of help.

11:07.420 --> 11:09.845
I noticed they have a new treatment plant.

11:10.006 --> 11:14.135
Do you ever see that one?

11:14.776 --> 11:14.937
Yeah.

11:15.077 --> 11:15.999
I see.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.963
I guess it's still being built.

11:17.983 --> 11:19.086
Yeah, it's enormous.

11:19.106 --> 11:19.907
Yeah, I know it is.

11:20.348 --> 11:22.253
It's being built in a terrible place, too.

11:22.273 --> 11:24.939
It'll never be being built there.

11:24.959 --> 11:25.159
Um...

11:25.578 --> 11:39.760
Well, when you read through these news clippings here, you will see a comment that either Senator Kennedy or Secretary of Interior and Rudolph made when they were visiting the National River in 1966.

11:40.501 --> 11:44.667
And they said that we had been

11:45.423 --> 11:53.534
brought all of these people together, hundreds of people together, to demonstrate our concern for the Nashua.

11:53.994 --> 12:06.891
And they said, boy, is this going to help us when we go back to the Congress and we can tell them that where there had been public apathy,

12:07.343 --> 12:08.965
about polluted rivers.

12:09.025 --> 12:13.490
There is now vital citizen concern.

12:13.510 --> 12:24.283
And so they went back and they voted, Congress voted on $6 billion, you know, for the contrary.

12:24.583 --> 12:29.369
And they said, now $170 million of this is coming to Massachusetts.

12:29.389 --> 12:29.629
Great.

12:29.649 --> 12:37.198
Well, at the same time that we had put together a petition to Governor

12:38.022 --> 12:52.528
And we had, in just, geez, I think it was, I don't know, three weeks, something like this, we gathered over 6,000 signatures, and we took them into Governor Volpe, and they're protesting the condition of the river.

12:52.548 --> 13:00.823
And we knew that a bill within state legislation had been proposed then to set up a division of water pollution.

13:02.744 --> 13:08.773
of 150 million dollars to help construct wastewater treatment facilities.

13:08.934 --> 13:16.826
And so we really went right to work and contacted all of our legislators to ask them to support the passage of this legislation.

13:16.946 --> 13:25.139
And, you know, I think it was a week later the bill was passed and there's been a no-chance passage bill that legislated here.

13:25.159 --> 13:27.182
So we feel

13:27.162 --> 13:34.732
that we really worked awfully hard to gain passage of legislation that was going to provide money.

13:35.072 --> 13:39.598
It wasn't just for the national, though, but for all the communities.

13:39.798 --> 13:42.882
But it was pretty much on a first-come, first-served basis.

13:43.623 --> 13:53.355
And I think initially there was enough money for all the communities, but how many communities were really that interested in organizing?

13:53.791 --> 14:00.823
Because they were going to have to put up some of the local monies themselves, and so there weren't a lot of communities that wanted to be first in line.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.366
Even 10% for them was a lot of money.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.089
Yeah, and before then it was more than that.

14:04.149 --> 14:14.888
Actually, it was 25%, because then the state would put up... Oh, jeez, I guess the federal government would put up... I think that they...

14:15.121 --> 14:42.073
was a maximum like maybe 75% in the beginning and the locals would have to come up with 25% so you didn't see very many cities lining up to be first and but we were really lucky that in Fitchburg we had Bill Flynn who was the mayor then who felt that

14:42.661 --> 14:48.308
the city of Fitchburg had a moral responsibility to do its share to clean up the national river.

14:49.169 --> 14:51.612
And that's pretty rare among mayors.

14:53.274 --> 15:04.868
And that was a very different point of view than previous or succeeding mayors of the city have had.

15:05.429 --> 15:09.113
How many treatment plants did they finally put out?

15:09.273 --> 15:09.734
Two.

15:09.754 --> 15:12.297
And they are the most

15:13.120 --> 15:26.613
I mean, I think Fitchbury, at least about a year ago, was the only city in the United States that had in operation two advanced wastewater treatment facilities.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.816
Why are there two in Fitchbury?

15:29.836 --> 15:31.618
Well, very interesting.

15:33.100 --> 15:38.605
One in West Fitchburg was designed to treat industrial waste primarily.

15:38.888 --> 15:40.951
Yep.

15:40.971 --> 15:42.794
And that is a municipal facility.

15:43.055 --> 15:53.172
And because it's a municipal facility, federal and state monies were given for the construction of that facility.

15:53.192 --> 15:57.198
Now, that would not be possible today.

15:59.842 --> 16:03.208
And the industries would have to build that themselves.

16:04.353 --> 16:08.118
But, of course, construction costs are just a part of the cost.

16:08.239 --> 16:11.844
Another important part of the cost are operation and maintenance costs.

16:12.705 --> 16:16.490
And that's what people in Pitchburg are really trying to do.

16:16.590 --> 16:19.395
You still have some problems in Clinton, though, I guess.

16:19.415 --> 16:25.864
Yes, but we were... What is the problem in Clinton?

16:25.884 --> 16:28.528
What is the problem in Clinton?

16:28.548 --> 16:30.951
Excuse me, I think whoever that is is...

16:31.775 --> 16:33.597
I'll return, you know, these things.

16:33.657 --> 16:35.439
I'll copy them in a copier.

16:35.499 --> 16:35.959
All right.

16:35.979 --> 16:36.620
Yeah.

16:37.601 --> 16:39.123
This is a fascinating little article.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.724
I'm almost finished.

16:40.944 --> 16:41.145
Oh.

16:41.165 --> 16:42.926
Let it go.

16:43.968 --> 16:44.068
Yeah.

16:45.369 --> 16:50.234
You mentioned on the phone that the Nashua has recently been given a B rating.

16:50.815 --> 16:57.141
And reading this, a lot of people thought that a D was the highest it could ever get.

16:59.264 --> 17:08.625
It's supposed to be brought up to, I think they're calling it a B1 now, because they've changed their classification system.

17:09.667 --> 17:10.489
And...

17:10.908 --> 17:21.057
We haven't heard this officially, but we were told that it would probably attain that classification this past winter.

17:21.838 --> 17:25.561
And I just am assuming that it did.

17:25.601 --> 17:28.003
I don't know whether it did or not.

17:28.483 --> 17:34.749
But the state is in the process now of monitoring.

17:35.249 --> 17:40.594
Who can I follow and talk to to get some information on that, do you think?

17:43.055 --> 17:53.070
I think, um, let's see, I think probably a fellow over in Westboro.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.815
Yeah, down the street.

17:56.835 --> 17:58.297
A year old Sanctuary.

17:58.337 --> 18:02.203
They've got, it might be worth your while to go over there to their office.

18:02.243 --> 18:04.606
Have you ever been to their office in Westboro?

18:04.626 --> 18:04.747
No.

18:04.887 --> 18:07.470
I want to do a really powerful job on this.

18:07.490 --> 18:08.953
You know where it is?

18:09.053 --> 18:09.153
No.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.315
What's the name of the office?

18:10.335 --> 18:10.615
I'll find it.

18:10.898 --> 18:18.028
It's a division of Water Pollution Control, and it's at the old... That's where they put out that magazine, I think, right?

18:18.088 --> 18:18.890
Yeah, that's right.

18:19.210 --> 18:20.852
They do, and that's Fish and Wildlife.

18:20.912 --> 18:23.056
But you want to go to Water Pollution Control.

18:25.179 --> 18:28.083
And... Let's see.

18:28.383 --> 18:28.964
That's okay.

18:29.064 --> 18:29.725
Okay.

18:29.745 --> 18:32.109
I think I know who the... Okay.

18:32.129 --> 18:33.310
It's at Lyman School.

18:33.531 --> 18:33.691
Oh.

18:34.853 --> 18:36.255
I think I'm a street from where I live.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.056
Okay.

18:37.076 --> 18:37.176
Okay.

18:38.810 --> 18:57.677
The guy that we had, who was such a good contact, just left Visual Water Pollution Control to work on an advanced degree, and we don't have a really good... Can I ask you a question and change the subject a little bit?

18:57.697 --> 18:58.759
I'm kind of interested in that photo.

19:09.387 --> 19:13.430
Did it really stink, or were you talking imagery?

19:13.931 --> 19:17.013
No, I don't know that it did when we first moved here.

19:17.474 --> 19:21.437
The drought, I think, really started in about 64.

19:22.978 --> 19:26.702
And the first year we were here, it wasn't as bad.

19:26.902 --> 19:28.803
It became worse after here.

19:29.104 --> 19:35.689
I mean, could you sit here in your porch and have that actual... Oh, yes.

19:35.709 --> 19:38.972
I happen to have a very poor sense of smell, but...

19:39.475 --> 19:46.103
During the drought, not only could it be smelled here, but it could be smelled in the center of Groton.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.626
I mean, it was terrible.

19:49.207 --> 20:07.288
And I remember driving with my kids, and we were little then, we'd be starting down the hill, and they would say, okay, hold your nose, and they'd hold their nose, and they'd hold it as long as they could until we crossed the river, but they could never hold their nose long enough to get beyond this.

20:07.927 --> 20:10.992
terrible smell, isn't it?

20:11.012 --> 20:33.546
I mean, I think it's important when we're talking about how do you clean up a river, you know, we still have to get back to what people can relate to, you know, you're ruining the river, it smells, there's no more fish in there, you know, I think that... Oh, yeah, not only that, but, I mean, the people... The quality of life is going to be adversely altered, I think, you know.

20:34.572 --> 20:38.458
I think these important things are touchstones.

20:38.478 --> 20:39.199
That's right.

20:39.720 --> 20:46.971
And I think that's a very important point to make, that we're really concerned.

20:47.012 --> 20:50.056
We're not concerned just about the fish and the birds.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.999
We're concerned about the people.

20:52.620 --> 20:56.226
And that during the drought,

20:56.932 --> 21:04.644
I know that there was a man in Peckle who was trying to sell his land along the river.

21:05.465 --> 21:17.945
And FHA gave him no value on his land and cited the reason as being the nuisance condition of the river.

21:18.626 --> 21:22.191
So people's land had no value.

21:23.273 --> 21:24.475
They couldn't sell it.

21:25.720 --> 21:41.940
And we felt it was very unjust that people upstream were putting their garbage into the river and dumping it on people's yards downstream and totally devaluing their properties.

21:42.697 --> 21:50.826
And, of course, making it impossible for them to use or enjoy their land.

21:50.846 --> 22:02.859
And it used to be, about 40 years ago, that people in this area swam in the river and really enjoyed the river.

22:02.919 --> 22:04.180
Do you foresee that?

22:04.661 --> 22:05.402
Oh, yes.

22:06.683 --> 22:07.183
Definitely.

22:07.203 --> 22:08.365
Are we close to that, do you think?

22:08.385 --> 22:09.126
Definitely.

22:10.327 --> 22:10.867
Definitely.

22:10.907 --> 22:12.349
We're very close to it.

22:12.818 --> 22:17.143
I just brought you out a little photograph that appeared in the newspaper.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.106
Is this the boy with the rainbow?

22:20.187 --> 22:21.649
Or somebody with a rainbow throat?

22:21.769 --> 22:23.411
Well, there is, yeah.

22:23.431 --> 22:30.319
I mentioned this in my letter to... Now, you know, I mentioned this in my letter to Country Journal.

22:32.121 --> 22:39.450
And I said, just recently, because you had mentioned this, I said a young fly boat, a young fisherman caught a punk rainbow.

22:39.667 --> 22:40.609
Oh, this is true.

22:40.670 --> 22:46.084
This just happened to be a picture of a rainbow trout in the North Nashua River in the city of Fitchburg now.

22:46.324 --> 22:54.165
Who would have ever, in Fitchburg, would ever have thought that there would be fish in the river again?

22:55.175 --> 22:57.177
And it's incredible.

22:57.197 --> 22:58.139
Can I borrow this too?

22:58.159 --> 22:58.839
You can have it.

23:00.702 --> 23:07.750
But there are people right now who are fishing in the National River here in this section.

23:07.770 --> 23:15.540
You have to tell them where I go take pictures of some of these things.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.085
And they are catching trout and pickerel and bat.

23:20.572 --> 23:23.237
Now, is the state stocking it with these fish?

23:23.257 --> 23:23.617
No.

23:23.677 --> 23:24.639
They're just coming back?

23:24.659 --> 23:33.895
The state isn't stocking the Nashwood yet, but they are stocking some of the tributaries, the Nisiticits and the Squanacos.

23:34.035 --> 23:37.341
And they're making their way into the Nashwood?

23:37.521 --> 23:37.862
Yeah.

23:37.902 --> 23:38.783
Isn't that something like that?

23:39.284 --> 23:39.484
Yeah.

23:39.524 --> 23:41.027
And there are eagles.

23:41.007 --> 23:44.373
Now, bald eagles, decided this year and last year.

23:44.954 --> 23:45.435
Where?

23:46.036 --> 23:48.341
On the National River here in the Bronx.

23:48.882 --> 23:49.964
And what's the significance?

23:49.984 --> 23:51.126
I had that in my letter.

23:51.286 --> 23:51.567
Yeah.

23:51.627 --> 23:52.709
You mentioned that.

23:52.789 --> 23:52.889
Yeah.

23:52.909 --> 23:58.099
Well, I'm not sure what the whole significance of that is.

23:58.300 --> 24:02.307
I think, one, is that we do have a...

24:04.531 --> 24:05.612
for eagles.

24:05.632 --> 24:17.022
That is a large enough natural area that eagles are coming into this area.

24:17.043 --> 24:24.650
And we do have a great blue heron in Osprey here.

24:25.871 --> 24:32.817
And it is a resting and feeding area for waterfowl.

24:33.269 --> 24:45.380
And I don't know if these birds are nesting here or not, but this is something that we are seeking to determine now.

24:45.400 --> 24:49.584
You're pretty sure that they would have vacated when the river was out of prison?

24:50.104 --> 24:52.646
The eagles were not here before.

24:54.909 --> 25:01.054
And, of course, they are catching food in the river, catching fish.

25:01.074 --> 25:02.095
Sure, right.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.925
So they are feeding here.

25:04.945 --> 25:08.868
Now, you mentioned some of the tributaries in the Mississippi.

25:09.549 --> 25:20.098
In cleaning up the Nashua and the river branches off, I mean, does part of your effort extend to these tributaries too?

25:20.118 --> 25:20.198
Yes.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.139
And how about the success?

25:21.840 --> 25:23.141
Very successful.

25:23.161 --> 25:24.762
I don't have a map here to show you.

25:24.782 --> 25:29.426
We're having a map prepared at our office now, which is showing all the land in the Greenway.

25:29.766 --> 25:32.509
Oh, I'd love to see that.

25:32.609 --> 25:32.689
Yes.

25:34.441 --> 25:36.266
It might be one we could send to Country Journal.

25:36.306 --> 25:37.409
Yeah, yeah.

25:38.191 --> 25:42.101
And we're very lucky that there is such an active group on both.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.206
I have a map of this.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.331
I have all of Everett's stories.

25:46.351 --> 25:46.572
Okay.

25:47.414 --> 25:48.898
I don't know if you have any of them.

25:48.978 --> 25:49.319
I do.

25:49.379 --> 25:50.121
It works.

26:01.475 --> 26:10.831
Well, on the Niseticit River, there is a Niseticit River Land Trust, which is very active.

26:15.299 --> 26:17.904
Is this pretty current now?

26:17.924 --> 26:21.390
This is now 74, but very clean, relatively clean.

26:21.758 --> 26:36.796
Yes, the Niseticit is very clean, and the Niseticit and the Squanacook are, the Niseticit is particularly fine stream.

26:36.816 --> 26:40.200
It used to get bad right around here, right?

26:42.262 --> 26:46.888
Yeah, it was bad right from West Fitchburg, from

26:47.324 --> 27:02.861
warehouse where they used to empty in to the river even before it became, it was the Whitman River before it even became the North Nashua.

27:02.901 --> 27:11.390
That was where the pollution started and the river became unsuitable.

27:12.051 --> 27:16.656
It was grossly polluted from that point, just below

27:17.480 --> 27:20.168
the Snow's Mill Pond.

27:20.328 --> 27:21.512
Do you know Snow's Mill Pond?

27:21.913 --> 27:22.515
Yes, I do.

27:22.735 --> 27:23.056
Okay.

27:23.237 --> 27:27.890
Well, all the way to Nashua, New Hampshire, it was grossly polluted.

27:29.294 --> 27:31.641
And the Squanacook River

27:32.482 --> 27:46.199
It was polluted from here to here by two paper companies in West Groton constructed their own wastewater treatment facilities and restored this section of the Squanicoke.

27:46.279 --> 27:48.481
Is this independent of your efforts?

27:48.581 --> 27:48.822
No.

27:50.504 --> 27:53.587
It wasn't independent of our efforts.

27:57.432 --> 27:58.974
So that's part of the whole thing.

27:58.994 --> 28:01.577
It's part of the whole thing.

28:03.818 --> 28:27.953
I'll tell you one thing that I think is significant and that's really been helpful to us is that, and I think that a big part of it was luck and coincidence, but at the very beginning of our efforts, I think we did just about everything right.

28:31.004 --> 28:47.511
had been contacted, and you will read about this, you already read about it, this fellow from Hollis, New Hampshire, Wayne Kimmelin, was the chair of the conservation mission there, and they got a petition to their government, okay, and they contacted us, and that's what I thought.

28:47.491 --> 28:56.181
Oh, jeez, I really, really wish you'd acquire the land first, but here is an opportunity to do something about cleaning up the river.

28:56.241 --> 28:58.524
I mean, we're in this drought situation.

28:58.564 --> 29:00.787
The river will never be worse than it is now.

29:01.227 --> 29:05.032
People's attention is focused on the river, so we'd better go with that.

29:05.513 --> 29:08.316
And besides, Hollis has already become interested.

29:09.317 --> 29:12.941
So I then contacted a couple of people.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.945
I didn't know them, but people that I'd

29:16.330 --> 29:19.074
had heard were leaders in their communities.

29:19.694 --> 29:34.173
Got them to sit down with me to plot a strategy and we decided that we would develop this petition effort in Massachusetts.

29:34.914 --> 29:41.843
And we got all of our signatures and took them in and decided to take them in to Governor Baldy.

29:42.644 --> 29:45.087
And my husband made this very good suggestion.

29:45.107 --> 29:45.628
He said

29:46.283 --> 30:01.322
Our efforts would have much greater effect on Governor Bolte if our top elected officials presented the petition than if a group of citizens went in with the petition.

30:01.883 --> 30:06.889
And somebody else said, oh, you really ought to have something really dramatic, something splashy.

30:06.910 --> 30:13.158
And so we got this bottle of polluted river water, which was very splashy.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.299
And so...

30:15.916 --> 30:17.198
that ran them out of the river?

30:18.199 --> 30:20.662
No, as it turns out, it wasn't.

30:20.742 --> 30:23.186
It was not taken just at random.

30:23.346 --> 30:25.689
It was a so-called good sample.

30:25.709 --> 30:38.726
And so I got contact with the mayors of the cities and the chairman of the board of the selectmen and asked them if they would present the petition to the governor.

30:39.868 --> 30:40.168
And...

30:45.937 --> 30:47.759
make this presentation.

30:47.779 --> 31:03.773
Oh, and then I... But how many mayors did you... All of them, 15, I guess, the mayors, all the mayors and the chairmen of the board of selectmen along the river in Massachusetts, I guess they were 13, went in to present these petitions.

31:03.793 --> 31:13.142
And then I contacted, I identified all of our state legislators who represented us to ask them if they would be present.

31:14.624 --> 31:25.257
They were all there, and I think there were 24 of them, except one whose youngster had become very sick and couldn't be there.

31:25.277 --> 31:30.023
And this made a great impression on Governor Dalby.

31:31.004 --> 31:44.040
And I felt he was sincere when he said that he was tremendously impressed with the fact that these busy people would take the time

31:44.341 --> 31:50.892
and showed the interest to make this presentation.
