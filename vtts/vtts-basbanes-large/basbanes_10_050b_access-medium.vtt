00:04.283 --> 00:13.872
Unlike Bill Stoneman who came in as Shidey's private employee but was working on the premises I came on from the beginning as a Princeton employee.

00:14.152 --> 00:16.274
Now Paul, does that continue with Paul?

00:16.554 --> 00:16.795
No.

00:16.995 --> 00:26.283
As a matter of fact, that was one of the things Paul negotiated, was that he... Are there matters of... Well... I have to think the very basic thing would matter.

00:26.644 --> 00:33.430
Well, obviously it didn't matter to Bill Stoneman quite so much for people who are married and doesn't have a family, but Paul is.

00:34.304 --> 00:36.767
That was pretty shrewd as many.

00:36.787 --> 00:40.351
It goes up in my neck of the woods now, too.

00:41.552 --> 00:55.468
Harry's reading his guide to social action.

00:55.488 --> 01:03.737
One of the things I wanted to do this letter is to put a big heap of leaves in the corner.

01:04.443 --> 01:06.107
Where do your readers come in here?

01:06.688 --> 01:15.908
Well, we get them started here, but they actually use the books in the department's room because, well, we'd like to open a lot of books.

01:15.928 --> 01:17.351
I would, yeah.

01:17.391 --> 01:20.838
This is all technically, we're on the first floor of the library.

01:21.459 --> 01:21.600
Yeah.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.143
And you have three books.

01:23.647 --> 01:32.459
Right, one of the advantages to having the exhibition here is that you don't have to go past the barriers, you don't have to have an aspect of the task.

01:32.479 --> 01:38.547
See, this is supposed to reverse itself, but it hasn't been reverse itself.

01:38.567 --> 01:39.349
Sorry.

01:40.931 --> 01:46.679
They come in because they just walk in and then come right through.

01:46.799 --> 01:49.182
What was here before?

01:49.533 --> 01:53.757
When the library was first built, it was a big, comfy reading room.

01:53.797 --> 01:56.781
There was a balcony.

01:56.801 --> 02:00.985
Of course, the cathedral was in the chapel.

02:01.165 --> 02:03.067
I've not seen a picture of it, but that's what I'm told.

02:03.087 --> 02:04.248
The balcony came down.

02:05.690 --> 02:09.894
Then it was a microphone reading room, and then here it is.

02:11.836 --> 02:12.417
It's beautiful.

02:12.998 --> 02:14.359
They did a nice job.

02:15.908 --> 02:24.279
Thank you.

02:24.339 --> 02:30.588
How often does Lloyd come by to look in?

02:30.968 --> 02:42.844
This is not actually going to be back until October, but his plans change.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.304
One never knows.

02:46.404 --> 02:52.032
Anyway, you can actually see more clearly from up above that it is in the shape of an open book.

02:52.774 --> 02:52.834
Oh.

02:52.854 --> 02:54.736
And you can see how the rooms fit together.

02:58.241 --> 02:58.542
Yeah.

02:59.223 --> 03:01.606
And we call that the giant book.

03:05.251 --> 03:09.137
It's a giant book.

03:09.157 --> 03:09.978
It is 45.

03:09.998 --> 03:12.021
The ceiling is 22.

03:22.733 --> 03:26.538
Before I forget, do you recommend a nice restaurant, of course, and I can take my hand.

03:26.558 --> 03:26.718
Come on.

03:27.319 --> 03:27.839
Let's see.

03:27.859 --> 03:28.320
Probably later.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.681
It'll be like 4 o'clock.

03:31.964 --> 03:33.226
Well, what do you like?

03:33.266 --> 03:35.028
This is not exactly a restaurant, can you?

03:35.048 --> 03:35.669
It isn't.

03:35.829 --> 03:38.652
You could try Mediterra, which is on Palmer Square.

03:39.013 --> 03:39.533
Mediterra?

03:39.573 --> 03:40.234
Mediterranean?

03:40.635 --> 03:41.336
Yes.

03:41.356 --> 03:41.756
Good.

03:41.776 --> 03:44.479
I'll find something.

03:44.499 --> 03:47.844
I think instead of trying the traffic around New York at 5 o'clock, you may as well eat.

03:47.864 --> 03:48.825
Oh, yes.

03:48.845 --> 03:51.828
And then, you know, try and find traffic.

03:51.848 --> 03:52.369
Yes, Friday afternoon.

03:53.041 --> 03:56.025
Sign that we're working on the catalog project.

03:56.045 --> 03:58.888
We're checking the books against the records.

03:59.148 --> 04:02.052
What do you call this?

04:02.072 --> 04:03.113
Hydromeda?

04:03.493 --> 04:03.694
Hydromeda?

04:03.714 --> 04:05.236
Hydromeda, I think.

04:05.256 --> 04:05.796
I always forget.

04:05.816 --> 04:12.584
Anyway, it's taking the reading of the humidity and the temperature to make sure that the environment is stable.

04:18.131 --> 04:22.356
It's involved at the library.

04:22.893 --> 04:27.338
out of 120 million things, they have selected 18 in this wall.

04:27.879 --> 04:38.831
No, this is probably just trying to get as much stuff in here as possible, but you can see, even in the 20th century, you can probably get a sense of how diverse it is.

04:39.692 --> 04:41.735
Can I take a picture?

04:41.755 --> 04:45.219
Oh, sure.

04:45.239 --> 04:50.605
We've got everything from, you know, parody style, to

04:51.209 --> 05:17.571
in the costumes of fairytales, and, well, there are people looking at charity books, and books from adult authors, that's not so much on books of information.

05:18.040 --> 05:31.119
Science, I'm not sure if that's something we should.

05:31.139 --> 05:33.202
I'll look it on the bridge there.

05:33.222 --> 05:33.402
Oh, yeah.

05:33.422 --> 05:34.604
I can just tell you.

05:34.764 --> 05:35.125
Okay.

05:35.145 --> 05:35.705
Okay.

05:35.725 --> 05:36.026
Thank you.

05:36.146 --> 05:37.127
Thank you.

05:37.147 --> 05:37.348
Thank you.

05:37.368 --> 05:38.990
Thank you.

05:39.010 --> 05:39.491
Thank you.

05:39.571 --> 05:40.232
Thank you.

05:40.773 --> 05:41.293
Thank you.

05:41.313 --> 05:42.295
Thank you.

05:42.315 --> 05:42.916
Thank you.

05:42.936 --> 05:43.497
Thank you.

05:43.517 --> 05:43.857
Thank you.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.179
Thank you.

05:45.199 --> 05:45.419
Thank you.

05:45.980 --> 05:46.180
Thank you.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.202
Oh, that's just terrific, isn't it?

05:47.222 --> 05:47.322
Yeah.

05:47.605 --> 05:50.047
Is that less?

05:50.068 --> 05:50.815
He wants more in.

05:51.380 --> 05:51.642
More in.

05:57.713 --> 06:04.563
I'm not quite sure if she wrote this album.

06:04.683 --> 06:08.909
Sometimes I was going around saying, yeah, come on back and meet my staff.

06:08.929 --> 06:11.793
They just come from California.

06:11.813 --> 06:12.775
So how do you spend most of you there?

06:12.795 --> 06:18.303
Oh gosh, well now, this week I've been doing interviews.

06:18.323 --> 06:26.775
I'm going to offer two of tickets.

06:27.160 --> 06:31.765
I'm supposed to be spending most of my time on the catalog projects, but a lot of other things come up.

06:31.785 --> 06:33.948
But that's what I'm supposed to be doing.

06:35.269 --> 06:35.810
This is beautiful.

06:36.271 --> 06:36.511
Yes.

06:37.052 --> 06:41.457
We need to do something about those save boxes.

06:42.378 --> 06:43.779
This is Ron Lane at Harvard.

06:43.839 --> 06:45.662
He manages the depository.

06:45.862 --> 06:47.344
He tells you you have too much air there.

06:48.385 --> 06:50.367
Yeah, well... What are you going to do?

06:51.494 --> 06:56.539
The shells get larger and smaller and smaller, as they go up, 17 levels, and there's no air.

06:56.579 --> 06:57.900
Everything's in there.

06:57.920 --> 07:06.347
Well, it's part of the problem here, since this is in a public space, because, you know, yeah, we could put them back tight, but it wouldn't look... No, this is wonderful.

07:07.008 --> 07:09.110
So... I'm teasing.

07:09.130 --> 07:13.434
Oh, well, no, it's actually a problem because of all this.

07:13.454 --> 07:13.554
Yeah.

07:13.574 --> 07:15.195
What kind of wood is this?

07:15.215 --> 07:16.216
It's cherry veneer.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.497
Cherry veneer, such as a hair.

07:18.198 --> 07:20.240
And, of course, you have to tie this.

07:20.380 --> 07:21.501
It's very important.

07:22.088 --> 07:35.558
The group coming in for homecoming.

07:35.723 --> 07:41.272
He went to the Gutenberg Bible and found a tiger.

07:41.312 --> 07:43.556
That's pretty cool if you can do that.

07:44.498 --> 07:49.806
I'm surprised that the people down in Champaign Development haven't called me up lately for a picture of a tiger.

07:49.826 --> 07:56.197
He's actually keeping a file of tiger pictures after because I know eventually that one.

07:56.297 --> 08:02.187
Do you want me to take you over to the office of East Plain?

08:03.517 --> 08:07.574
You'll have to take me over.

08:07.594 --> 08:08.056
You can just put me in.

08:08.076 --> 08:09.301
I'll shut this up now.

08:09.321 --> 08:09.662
I'll have a look.
