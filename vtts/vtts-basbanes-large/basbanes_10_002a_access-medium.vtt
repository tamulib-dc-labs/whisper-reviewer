WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:04.764
Well, that's fine.

00:04.845 --> 00:08.888
I can concentrate on you.

00:08.928 --> 00:16.615
So the new building and the bit of the old building, which it joins up with, is really divided between the library and the exhibition.

00:16.835 --> 00:32.670
That's the Mappamundi and Chained Library exhibition is its full title, which is all along the ground floor, and that contains the Mappamundi and the Chained Library, which is really the history of the library frozen at 1840, approximately.

00:33.072 --> 01:00.295
um which i'll show you all that part later but um that's all on the ground floor for the general public but this class on the upper floor is for readers only but this is where anyone who's working on any part of the collection comes to read so generally speaking what what kinds of readers do you get well all sorts because our collection although small is very varied so the lady who's working there now for instance is doing local history on um one of the local villages and using

01:00.528 --> 01:14.488
some of the old documents that we have, because although we only have the records of the cathedral, that does encompass quite a lot of local material as well, because especially in the Middle Ages, the cathedral was a great landowner.

01:16.531 --> 01:18.293
You're familiar with cathedrals, aren't you?

01:18.353 --> 01:22.239
So I can use terms like Dean and chapter, and you'll know what I mean.

01:22.820 --> 01:30.130
But we also, as you see, still have a modern working library, so we have people using the modern theological collection as well.

01:30.363 --> 01:33.908
anyone doing any sort of various sort of historical studies.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.312
So our readers are not many, but they're various, like the collections.

01:37.332 --> 01:46.944
And the great thing about Hertford Cathedral Library, I think, is really its continuity, I mean, compared to other things.

01:46.984 --> 01:48.346
It's never been very large.

01:48.366 --> 01:58.719
I mean, it was a respectable size in the Middle Ages, but unlike most other cathedral libraries, it hasn't ever suffered any great disasters in terms of loss of stock.

01:58.839 --> 01:59.340
So...

01:59.962 --> 02:07.913
Our proud boast is that we've had a working theological library here since the 12th century, more or less, continuously, I mean, with various variations.

02:07.953 --> 02:14.182
So our collections, although it's small, as I said, but we do have books from every period.

02:14.362 --> 02:16.225
How did you manage to survive the dissolution?

02:17.286 --> 02:18.708
Well, of course, we were a secular cathedral.

02:20.130 --> 02:21.152
We were not monastic.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.635
So that's an important distinction.

02:23.715 --> 02:26.459
You know about this?

02:27.621 --> 02:29.884
Well, certainly the cathedrals

02:30.269 --> 02:32.151
were not attached to monasteries.

02:32.171 --> 02:34.013
They were run by bodies of secular canons.

02:35.235 --> 02:36.436
So there was nothing to be dissolved.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.979
So we didn't, in fact, lose anything by the dissolution.

02:39.019 --> 02:51.133
In fact, ironically, we gained, because one of the commissioners involved in the dissolution in this area was actually an antiquary and collected a lot of manuscripts from other collections, which she later passed on to the cathedral library.

02:51.373 --> 02:52.374
And who was Edmund?

02:52.394 --> 02:55.558
Sir John Price, which is usually spelt P-R-I-S-E.

02:56.619 --> 02:57.340
He was quite a...

02:57.522 --> 03:00.945
I thought you were going to say Robert Cotton, but he came with just a bit afterwards.

03:01.405 --> 03:02.607
Oh, yes, not the same.

03:03.607 --> 03:07.051
He wasn't quite in that league.

03:07.251 --> 03:11.114
So we have a lot of manuscripts from Gloucester, St.

03:11.134 --> 03:17.540
Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, which is now Gloucester Cathedral, and Simon Sester, and various other monastic establishments roundabout.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.102
So the dissolution was not a problem.

03:20.343 --> 03:23.806
The Civil War should have been, but we seem to have survived that pretty well as well.

03:23.846 --> 03:27.529
I think the city was besieged

03:28.066 --> 03:51.441
um during the civil war but i think there was some protection of uh and the city lined up with the royalists or with the uh with the royalists i think i'm not an expert i haven't really done that but you can find that of course but anyway we've been very lucky in surviving things like that and and even surviving major sales in the 19th and 20th century which is which well vermont and mundy was a recent uh

03:51.775 --> 04:18.542
yes we couldn't even get rid of that thank goodness well it's uh well thanks to all of that we do hire a building which is the main thing the building has done as far as from the library history point of view is that it's enabled us to bring all the chain library together it had been um actually moved from the lady chapel where it was originally in 1841 and had never been all together again in one place until 1996 so that was

04:18.607 --> 04:20.450
That was the main achievement.

04:20.490 --> 04:24.695
Could you tell us just a little bit about the Chained Library, the history?

04:25.116 --> 04:29.642
I know that you're writing this history, and I don't mean to get it to a great deal.

04:29.662 --> 04:34.609
Well, no, I was trying to think what things I could... Well, how long has there been a Chained Library?

04:34.689 --> 04:37.934
Well, the present Chained Library was begun in 1611.

04:38.635 --> 04:44.783
There was a library before which was presumably Chained, but nothing of the furniture survives of that.

04:45.218 --> 05:12.762
except possibly we think some of the benches might have been from the older library but that was the first library rule was um something sort of on this level but further north it was over the west walk of the cloister nothing of the medieval west walk of this cloister remains but that's where the first library was outside the window um that was only sometime in the 15th century we have no precise dates for that but as with so many other um

05:13.062 --> 05:20.831
libraries, institutions in general, and the first library room doesn't appear until late 14th or 15th century.

05:21.031 --> 05:22.373
Certainly true of cathedrals.

05:22.513 --> 05:25.376
Who generally were the readers, would you say?

05:26.477 --> 05:28.099
That's a very interesting question.

05:28.239 --> 05:30.682
It's very hard to identify, really.

05:30.722 --> 05:35.227
I mean, basically, it was and still is a private library belonging to the dean and canons.

05:36.068 --> 05:39.953
Obviously, their guests and friends used it as well.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.816
I think cathedral libraries have always been

05:43.167 --> 05:49.415
a bit more accessible to the public than, say, the university college libraries, I would think.

05:50.016 --> 05:58.827
There's not a lot of evidence, really, until one gets to borrowing registers, which don't really survive before the 18th century, and there's very little of that.

05:59.127 --> 06:01.330
That would be fascinating.

06:01.350 --> 06:08.179
I mean, one can make sort of an educated guess, but certainly I think that the Dean and Chapter would have made it available

06:08.817 --> 06:12.963
over most of its history to legitimate scholars, as we still do, really.

06:13.423 --> 06:16.868
But that would have been a fairly small amount of people.

06:16.928 --> 06:21.374
But it certainly was used by more than just the clergy.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.979
But accessibility probably explains the chains.

06:26.121 --> 06:27.423
Oh, well, yes.

06:28.224 --> 06:36.495
Whoever was using it, that was considered a very necessary form of security.

06:37.066 --> 06:56.037
not that they didn't trust well i suppose you know books walk very easily as we don't know and i'm dead even in the middle ages as we also know and of course we're so much more um rare and valuable uh we were up at durham yesterday oh yeah and they've never they've never been chained and i i asked uh no i don't know i'm i don't know enough about

06:56.236 --> 06:57.017
as I should.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.180
I haven't been concentrating on the monastic cathedrals.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.663
Well, I asked the question, and he said, well, we're different, he said, because we really didn't.

07:03.703 --> 07:06.505
These books were really for the exclusive use of the brothers.

07:07.566 --> 07:13.351
Yes, this is why another way was monastic cathedrals are a bit different, but secular cathedrals were a bit more spoken as well.

07:13.371 --> 07:17.535
So you undoubtedly had a greater concern for security, it would seem to me.

07:17.655 --> 07:19.237
Yes, that's probably very true.

07:19.597 --> 07:25.062
Yes, I haven't made enough of a study of the monastic cathedrals, but they certainly would be different, because the way they

07:25.548 --> 07:28.531
You know, the monks used books were different as well.

07:28.551 --> 07:33.597
I mean, they were compelled to read them and to write them, of course, which we didn't have a scriptorium here either.

07:33.997 --> 07:35.379
So there's never been a scriptorium here?

07:35.839 --> 07:41.665
No, although it does seem that some books were sort of made locally or made, you know, for the cathedral.

07:41.705 --> 07:42.767
You're anticipating my questions.

07:43.027 --> 07:43.567
Sorry.

07:43.587 --> 07:44.268
No, that's great.

07:44.388 --> 07:52.517
The history of the medieval library

07:53.003 --> 07:54.725
It's been very welcome in the introduction today.

07:54.745 --> 07:57.548
I don't know if you've come across it at all.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.871
It's called Miners and Thompson.

08:01.072 --> 08:05.056
Professor Thompson was really the main author of it.

08:05.076 --> 08:07.338
He'd also done something similar for Lincoln, where I was before.

08:07.358 --> 08:09.841
I don't know if Lincoln was on your list of places.

08:09.881 --> 08:11.323
It has a very fine Wren library for everybody.

08:11.883 --> 08:13.205
What kind of library?

08:13.225 --> 08:13.745
Christopher Wren.

08:14.045 --> 08:15.807
Oh, Christopher Wren.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.370
But he does a very good...

08:19.042 --> 08:22.192
The introduction is the best history of the medieval library to date.

08:22.493 --> 08:23.456
Is this book in print?

08:23.977 --> 08:25.582
Oh yes, but it's rather expensive.

08:25.763 --> 08:27.147
Is it for sale here?

08:29.113 --> 08:30.738
Yes, but it's £100 now.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.085
But I could photocopy the

08:33.824 --> 08:36.367
just the pages of the introduction for you, if that would be of use.

08:37.008 --> 08:41.153
I'd charge you for the photocopies, as I couldn't say.

08:41.193 --> 08:49.803
I wouldn't have expected you to want to, because the main bulk of it is, I mean, it's got some quite nice illustrations as well, but the main bulk of it is... But is it a catalogue of the library?

08:49.823 --> 08:51.145
Just of the medieval manuscripts.

08:51.925 --> 08:58.313
So we have 229 medieval manuscripts, which is, I think, the second

08:59.204 --> 09:04.491
after Lincoln for a secular cathedral in the number of manuscripts that survive.

09:07.234 --> 09:11.179
So that's quite useful history of the medieval library.

09:12.581 --> 09:16.425
And I'm not presuming, you know, I shall more or less tracey that.

09:16.445 --> 09:20.250
I'm not presuming to try and pretend I know any more than Professor Thompson does about that.

09:20.711 --> 09:22.172
And when was this book published?

09:22.213 --> 09:22.393
1993.

09:22.453 --> 09:23.754
It's quite recent.

09:23.774 --> 09:24.095
Yes.

09:24.435 --> 09:27.059
Although it's really, I've been very privileged to be here.

09:27.079 --> 09:27.439
It's a very...

09:28.162 --> 09:32.889
exciting time, you know, because this was such an important thing to do.

09:32.909 --> 09:40.460
There's so much more now we know about the manuscript and about history of the libraries.

09:40.741 --> 09:43.384
Well, because of the book, we now know more, yes.

09:44.466 --> 09:49.694
But anyway, so that's, I'll do that before you go.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.276
That'd be great, excellent.

09:51.376 --> 09:51.977
Charge 20p a sheet.

09:52.358 --> 09:53.900
Whatever, whatever.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.966
The only other thing that we actually sell, which I haven't got available here because it's

09:58.452 --> 10:27.042
exhibition is really the commercial side of the enterprise is a little guide that i wrote just about the chain library which i think i think i brought that oh the pink one i brought four things already downstairs oh well done oh you have you mean in in yes right here um the just pink one that yes um so that that's the only thing that actually sells specifically on the library although it does cover you know a lot of the history so that that's probably but it's not really a sort of i mean it's just a sort of

10:27.545 --> 10:33.972
drawn from other things, and I haven't... It'll already be cited in my pocket.

10:34.753 --> 10:37.356
I'm sorry, I haven't got the better thing available yet.

10:38.437 --> 10:43.864
Oh, well, Mr. Harbour, who's our exhibition's manager, is also very artistically designed that.

10:43.964 --> 10:45.445
Very nice.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.207
But you haven't actually been into the Chains Library.

10:47.348 --> 10:47.908
No, no, no.

10:48.329 --> 10:53.395
We were here a few minutes early, so we went and did some shopping.

10:53.415 --> 10:55.577
But that probably covers, you know,

10:56.519 --> 10:59.723
as much of the history as you need, in a way.

11:00.023 --> 11:02.126
I don't know.

11:03.087 --> 11:11.037
But obviously... I would also like to get a copy of the copyright page and the title page as well, so I can cite this?

11:11.158 --> 11:11.959
Yes, of course.

11:12.079 --> 11:13.921
Yes, I'll do that in a minute.

11:13.941 --> 11:23.353
And if you're... The thing I...

11:24.447 --> 11:32.040
These are now, I'll just print, because they were overtaken by the events of the museum.

11:32.060 --> 11:39.793
This was done by my predecessor, Miss Morgan and her father, but I think that can really... Is it something we can... I can't give you that.

11:39.813 --> 11:42.537
And the short guide, I think, probably doesn't add anything.

11:42.557 --> 11:48.147
That's just a photocopy anyway, but that was the short guide, which I think probably doesn't add anything in.

11:48.347 --> 11:48.908
Thank you.

11:49.088 --> 11:50.050
Great.

11:52.949 --> 12:04.222
So, if I can just pick your brains a little bit about the history that you're writing, so what are you concentrating on?

12:04.322 --> 12:04.822
On people?

12:05.363 --> 12:06.584
Oh, well, everything.

12:06.604 --> 12:17.016
I mean, as you know, it's very difficult with libraries, because there are so many different facets, you know, I'm sort of, because we have such a short time,

12:17.992 --> 12:20.114
Not time, but word limit.

12:20.494 --> 12:23.277
I've only got 5,000 more hours to do 1,200 years of history.

12:25.479 --> 12:35.669
So I think we have to do it chronologically, but of course within each period you have to consider acquisition, content, usage, finance, and housing and furnishings.

12:36.430 --> 12:38.652
I think those are the chief headings I'm thinking of.

12:39.052 --> 12:41.775
Administration, of course, and catalogs and things like that.

12:42.055 --> 12:46.159
And of course there are varied amounts of evidence for each thing in each period.

12:47.152 --> 12:49.836
It's always a difficult thing, right, in the institutional library that way, isn't it?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.419
There's just so many... Oh, it's too much.

12:51.659 --> 13:01.075
And just, well, and you have to sort of... I mean, we have quite a number of documents relating to the first building of the chained presses.

13:01.115 --> 13:02.477
That's quite well documented.

13:03.014 --> 13:06.880
But then there were centuries in which there was nothing about what was happening at all.

13:06.981 --> 13:09.024
So it's, you know, the usual sort of thing.

13:09.044 --> 13:17.759
Is this just about, I know that Broadly has some chained books, but they are not original, I mean, they brought these in after, they really did suffer in the dissolution.

13:17.959 --> 13:18.340
Yeah.

13:19.402 --> 13:25.291
Is this, I would say that this is probably the only working chained library in... Certainly the largest surviving is what we see.

13:25.632 --> 13:27.375
The largest surviving in the world.

13:27.395 --> 13:28.617
All its chains in the world.

13:29.052 --> 13:34.580
I think I can say the world, but certainly in Britain.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.203
And what are some of the others that exist?

13:37.223 --> 13:46.836
Well, there are more sort of small parish libraries that survive, like Franklin, and also in Terreford, which we now have in our exhibition as well.

13:46.897 --> 13:47.998
I've seen a very long story.

13:48.178 --> 13:53.566
My mind's gone blank.

13:55.148 --> 13:56.730
Anyway, there are a few.

13:56.930 --> 14:00.294
And some of the cathedral libraries, Wells, still have a few of its chains left.

14:00.334 --> 14:02.456
And the body, as you said, has a few.

14:03.317 --> 14:14.330
Even at Hereford, during the period when the cases were dismantled from the Lady Chapel, that was the most disruptive period, and some of the chains were taken off, but they were put on again later on.

14:14.510 --> 14:19.235
So they are the same chains and the same books, but they have been taken off and put on again.

14:19.255 --> 14:23.460
But we still think it's counted as a genuine survival.

14:23.508 --> 14:28.995
You mentioned earlier when we started that you described this chained library as frozen in time at 1840.

14:29.296 --> 14:32.320
Why is that date so significant?

14:32.340 --> 14:33.101
Well, that's about 1840.

14:33.121 --> 14:35.965
It was 1841 that the library was moved out of the Lady Chapel.

14:36.946 --> 14:39.489
And since then it's never really been the same again.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.593
And no books have been added to the chained presses since then.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.515
That's the main thing.

14:43.535 --> 14:45.297
So although it was sort of reconstructed,

14:45.530 --> 14:47.714
No books were chained after that date.

14:47.734 --> 14:51.941
They went on being chained right up into the early 19th century here, which is very unusual.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.167
Amazing.

14:55.187 --> 15:04.483
All the 19th century folio public record office commission reports are chained, just in the old manner.

15:04.801 --> 15:12.051
So it's almost like the Peeps Library in that you say nothing has been added and nothing has been removed, so it is a tiny capsule of a library.

15:12.252 --> 15:17.359
Well, that's sort of, but we do also understand it still is a working library and things are still used.

15:17.819 --> 15:18.420
With the chains?

15:18.701 --> 15:19.442
Readers have to...?

15:19.742 --> 15:21.344
Well, no, we have to.

15:21.364 --> 15:24.649
Nowadays, of course, it can't be a reading room because it's open to the public.

15:24.815 --> 15:28.360
So, sadly, it's not a library in the same sense anymore.

15:28.781 --> 15:32.386
But if people want to use the books, we have to unchain them, and they use them up in the reading room here.

15:32.787 --> 15:34.770
But they have to use them with the chains attached, I'm afraid.

15:34.790 --> 15:35.090
They do.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.131
Which is a great use.

15:36.993 --> 15:38.896
The chains are terribly bad for the books, of course.

15:38.916 --> 15:40.878
A great deal of charm in that, though.

15:41.179 --> 15:44.964
Well, yes, because you need at least three hands wanting to use the chains.

15:45.846 --> 15:50.232
But, yes, that's more or less.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.482
That's why the date 1841 is significant.

15:53.502 --> 16:10.617
In fact, things were, because at first, when it was put back together again, partly, in 1855, it was not put together accurately, so a lot of things weren't in their right places, and books that were added after that time were put on the same shelves, even though they weren't chained.

16:10.717 --> 16:20.185
But after the major restoration by Canon Streeter, which was 1930, it's all in the books, even though... That's when he sort of...

16:20.452 --> 16:45.109
restored the cases to how they used to be and the books to the right order that they have been in prior to 1841 and there was a catalogue that that gave him the key to that yes we haven't anything any catalog earlier than approximately 1718 sadly and then there are two or three more from the 18th century but um after that there isn't really another catalog till the end of the 19th century which includes all you know what was in the modern edition so

16:45.612 --> 16:47.634
Really, we've not been very good on cataloging, I'm afraid.

16:47.714 --> 16:54.161
But we have this thick clutch from the 18th century, which are the ones that... And how essentially were they catalogued?

16:54.381 --> 16:57.144
By subject, by... You mean catalogued or arranged?

16:57.945 --> 16:58.745
Either or.

16:58.966 --> 16:59.806
Well, yes.

16:59.826 --> 17:04.711
The first alphabetical catalogue by author isn't until the late 18th century.

17:04.752 --> 17:07.234
The earlier ones are shelf lists, really.

17:07.755 --> 17:09.396
And that's how the books were arranged as well.

17:09.857 --> 17:15.062
I think this is fairly standard, too, that on each side of a bookcase,

17:15.346 --> 17:33.979
would have a subject attached to it and then there seems to have been an attempt initially to arrange books alphabetically by author within the bay but obviously that couldn't be kept up when you're having a fixed location system so it you know because every book has

17:34.280 --> 17:36.865
was common, has its own fixification.

17:37.827 --> 17:42.075
Its own particular shelf number, so it always has to stay in that position of the shelf.

17:42.155 --> 17:47.385
Was the library originally constructed to allow optimum light, sunshine?

17:47.605 --> 17:49.088
No, it couldn't be.

17:49.549 --> 17:56.001
Theoretically, that style of library should have had windows in between the bays so that the light would run.

17:56.268 --> 17:58.250
It couldn't be, because it was put in the Lady Chapel.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.673
I don't know if we've been in the cathedral yet.

18:01.354 --> 18:05.579
Do have a look, because it's a wonderful little Gothic gem.

18:05.679 --> 18:06.800
It's beautiful now.

18:06.840 --> 18:13.868
And actually, probably having the library in it, I think he probably has to preserve some of the paintings on the tomb in there, which has been served very well.

18:13.888 --> 18:16.271
Where those tombs are on the right, that's where the library was?

18:17.913 --> 18:20.496
No, I've got the question, but it's right at the east end, anyway.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.300
So that's the far end of the cathedral.

18:24.449 --> 18:26.132
And it really is an exquisite little chapter.

18:26.152 --> 18:29.077
It's very hard to imagine that it was a library for 250 years.

18:29.618 --> 18:34.867
But because of, you know, the cases just went in there, so the lighting can't have been very good.

18:34.887 --> 18:37.671
I'd like to see that before we go where the library was.

18:37.711 --> 18:38.813
It's very hard to imagine.

18:39.034 --> 18:46.446
I think if you look at the, in the book, there's the only actual visual evidence we have for what it looked like in there.

18:47.027 --> 18:48.870
I think I've got that just to show you.

18:49.897 --> 18:52.783
But this is the thing to sort of hold up when you're actually in the Lady Chapel.

18:52.803 --> 18:54.285
It's a terribly bad drawing.

18:55.047 --> 18:56.610
But this shows, these are the chain presses.

18:57.993 --> 19:01.439
So you have to imagine looking, you can recognise the Lady Chapel from that.

19:01.980 --> 19:02.782
Is that period drawing?

19:03.123 --> 19:08.513
That's shortly before, well it says circa 1840, shortly before it was... That's something that's here?

19:09.134 --> 19:09.735
Yes.

19:09.835 --> 19:15.543
If when my book is published and we wanted to purchase a copy of that, and of course the paper writes to reproduce that, we could do that?

19:15.564 --> 19:16.224
Yes, certainly.

19:16.245 --> 19:17.486
Yes, we have the negative to that.

19:17.526 --> 19:20.170
I think it was only discovered not terribly long ago.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.494
That would be wonderful.

19:22.514 --> 19:26.460
It's a very bad drawing, but it's the only visual representation we have.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.461
But it's wonderful.

19:27.902 --> 19:33.170
One thing that would be nice to do in the exhibition is really have a better reconstruction of what it would have looked like.

19:33.190 --> 19:33.730
That's great.

19:34.031 --> 19:35.513
The scale is terrible, because there seems to be a...

19:35.898 --> 19:47.993
someone meant to be a person walking up there, and if he's really that high, he's about three foot high.

19:57.765 --> 20:00.629
Do you excuse me, I'm sorry.

20:00.649 --> 20:04.774
I want to go back to an earlier, because Connie and I were just, we're still a bit

20:04.957 --> 20:09.281
unclear as to the distinction between a secular cathedral and a... What is it?

20:09.401 --> 20:10.823
A secular and monastic.

20:10.843 --> 20:15.607
Well, a monastic cathedral, obviously, was also a monastery.

20:17.489 --> 20:20.652
But a secular cathedral was run by a body of secular canons.

20:20.753 --> 20:24.776
It's a confusing term because secular just means non-monastic.

20:24.797 --> 20:33.445
They were still clergy, obviously, but they weren't bound by rule or bound to live and be restricted to the house.

20:33.830 --> 20:37.936
The secular canons were in fact quite sort of active in the world and travelled about quite a lot.

20:38.176 --> 20:52.016
But when the dissolution came in 1536, I guess, whatever that was, 1536-38, not only did they dissolve the monasteries, but they made the Church of England the... Yes, but it didn't really affect the secular cathedrals.

20:52.056 --> 21:02.892
They went on much as before, which is why the secular cathedrals came to be called cathedrals of the old foundation, meaning that they carried on with their medieval statues.

21:03.310 --> 21:04.171
As we still do.

21:04.572 --> 21:06.935
But was it of a Catholic Church still?

21:07.476 --> 21:10.159
No, it was the Reformed Church of England, yes.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.042
But, I mean, we still have bishops, you know.

21:12.602 --> 21:20.813
But really, in essence, apart from now being Protestant, the way the cathedral is run has not essentially changed in many ways since the Middle Ages.

21:20.894 --> 21:26.641
I mean, the statutes have been reformed from time to time, but just sort of added to what was there before.

21:26.841 --> 21:29.285
But that's why we are known as cathedrals of the old foundation.

21:29.745 --> 21:33.250
But the monastic cathedrals, obviously the monasteries were dissolved,

21:33.601 --> 21:43.633
And they were re-founded on a very similar basis to the secular cathedrals, with a dean and chapter, but no longer monks.

21:44.334 --> 21:47.998
So they became known as cathedrals of the new foundation, which is very confusing.

21:49.800 --> 21:50.481
Did you know this?

21:50.561 --> 21:51.202
I didn't know that.

21:52.063 --> 21:53.104
It is very complicated.

21:53.124 --> 22:03.557
In fact, it's all going to change again very shortly, because there's a new cathedrals measuring, which is going to make all cathedrals the same anyway, and they're all going to be quite different and have much more lay representation.

22:04.010 --> 22:09.377
What's about to happen is the biggest change since the dissolution.

22:09.437 --> 22:16.886
Everything's going to be different.

22:16.906 --> 22:19.990
It's a very complicated thing.

22:20.411 --> 22:23.895
Of all the ancient cathedrals, it's about half each.

22:24.035 --> 22:25.637
Durham was monastic, obviously.

22:26.478 --> 22:27.400
York wasn't.

22:27.700 --> 22:28.441
Canterbury was.

22:29.963 --> 22:30.844
Hereford and Lincoln

22:31.178 --> 22:35.403
our secular, our Exeter, Chichester, Wells, Litchfield.

22:36.805 --> 22:40.290
The individual community could get together and support the cathedral.

22:40.991 --> 22:41.431
Yes.

22:41.451 --> 22:43.354
And determine it more.

22:43.374 --> 23:00.055
Yes, which is still, it's basically, we call it the Dean and Chapter, which is basically the dean in the few, a handful of residential canons, who usually have, the same offices tend to occur, presenter, chartered for music, and chancellor, chartered for books and learning.

23:00.524 --> 23:08.155
treasurer, obviously, and the archdeacon, which is really a diocesan official, but they tended to be on the chapter as well.

23:09.657 --> 23:11.259
So that's what is meant by the chapter.

23:11.319 --> 23:21.474
But there is also the greater chapter, which includes all the presentaries, and they are the ones who sit in the stalls in the choir, which have their own names.

23:22.015 --> 23:25.620
And the presents

23:25.955 --> 23:45.448
represented actual land or means of finance which actually it is quite complicated the year that the chaining was mandated i guess well yes but that still relates to the um

23:45.884 --> 24:13.292
medieval library so we don't know anything really about whether we think they we think they should certainly were supposed to be chained but um and there is evidence from a few of the surviving books that you know they were evidence of chain staples on the top or bottom of the cover um but we just have no other evidence really so that's formalized that formalized it in other words well it is just trying to tighten things up really the the new status and our printed books

24:13.475 --> 24:15.217
as well as manuscripts represented?

24:15.518 --> 24:15.958
Oh, yes.

24:16.239 --> 24:24.270
The manuscripts only cover two single sides of a bay.

24:24.310 --> 24:30.198
There are mainly double presses or bookcases, and one side we call a bay.

24:30.599 --> 24:33.984
So there are two bays that have manuscripts, and the rest are all early printed books.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.165
And canabula?

24:35.386 --> 24:37.849
Yes, we have about 50-odd canabula, yes.

24:37.869 --> 24:39.652
And what would you say are the jewels of the collection?

24:39.692 --> 24:43.397
Oh, well, the Hereford Gospels is our great treasure.

24:43.867 --> 24:46.471
I could probably actually show you those.

24:46.491 --> 24:53.360
I mean, the problem I have is that I can't really show you anything, actual books in the Chained Library, I'm afraid, because obviously it's open to the public.

24:53.400 --> 25:00.951
But I could take you down to our strong room where there are all our unchanged rare books and all the archives.

25:00.971 --> 25:05.618
We would greatly enjoy that, and it would get into the book.

25:05.698 --> 25:06.759
Yes, I know.

25:06.779 --> 25:08.642
I mean, this is what it's...

25:08.909 --> 25:13.746
And I promise to keep my pen in my jacket.

25:14.730 --> 25:18.864
So that's, I mean, all the medieval manuscripts are obviously all very special.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.012
But the Hereford Gospels... That's famous, of course.

25:21.312 --> 25:21.993
Very famous.

25:22.053 --> 25:22.954
The House of Gospels.

25:22.974 --> 25:23.915
Are you part of them?

25:23.995 --> 25:25.757
They're not as famous as the Book of People.

25:25.777 --> 25:28.520
I do believe there was a facsimile printed of it.

25:28.780 --> 25:29.921
No, sadly not yet.

25:30.882 --> 25:34.086
It's very modest by the standards of the 8th century.

25:34.827 --> 25:40.613
And it's very modest by the, you know, compared to things like the New Testament Gospels and the Book of Clothes, but it's the same sort of period.

25:40.733 --> 25:41.354
It's illuminated?

25:41.854 --> 25:47.961
There are three, just the first page of each Gospel was illuminated, and three of them survived.

25:48.021 --> 25:48.221
St.

25:48.261 --> 25:49.783
Luke has gone missing.

25:50.135 --> 25:52.719
The other three survive.

25:52.859 --> 25:57.585
It's quite modest, but it is the oldest thing in the cathedral, since we haven't any Roman remains.

25:57.605 --> 25:59.107
It's older than any part of the fabric.

25:59.248 --> 26:00.870
Eighth century.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.933
It's older than the cathedral, and the book survives.

26:03.473 --> 26:09.442
Yes, it's a bit of a mystery, because the cathedral was burnt down in 1055.

26:09.702 --> 26:15.450
The tradition is that these gospels were given by the last book, Monfaxon Bishop, Bishop Battleston, who died in 1056.

26:16.173 --> 26:18.916
And he's traditionally supposed to have given this book to the cathedral.

26:18.976 --> 26:29.368
How it survived, you know, the destruction of the cathedral in 1055, we don't know, but it's certainly a good deal older than anything else that we have.

26:30.809 --> 26:40.781
And it's just been there, sitting on the shelves, and it was rebounded in the 17th century very badly, which is sad, and then had a chain put on it, of course.

26:40.801 --> 26:41.582
It's 1,200 years old.

26:41.782 --> 26:42.883
Yeah.

26:42.903 --> 26:45.606
So that's where the history of the library starts, really.

26:45.974 --> 27:07.729
we don't know of anything before then of course there would have been there was a saxon cathedral on this site but again we know nothing about it really but um anyway now yes and how many presses are there in the chain library um six double and two single so that's 14 bays

27:08.030 --> 27:11.835
It's probably in here too, I'm sure.

27:11.855 --> 27:12.155
I hope so, yes.

27:13.157 --> 27:24.251
And I think I did actually list the... because the headings survive partly on the base themselves and partly in the catalogs, just in the different subject areas.

27:26.855 --> 27:31.321
So that's just... And they're now identified by letters, which is confusing.

27:31.341 --> 27:35.286
The letters don't actually mean anything, they're just letters to identify the different base.

27:35.789 --> 27:38.353
But that was a mid-18th century innovation.

27:38.393 --> 27:40.116
Before that, they were just numbered.

27:42.139 --> 27:49.109
Well, Robert Patton used the Roman emperors, which had made no chronological sense at all, but it was wonderful.

27:51.092 --> 28:02.910
The contents are... I mean, basically, it's always been a theological library primarily, including, obviously, biblical commentaries and church history and quite a lot of lore, certainly in the Middle Ages.

28:03.515 --> 28:26.130
but um yes and since in from the 17th century there's been a certain amount of of general scholarly things histories and travel a bit but um really not very much we aren't it's not a very wide-ranging collection in terms of content really but it's difficult to summarize that's also good and just i think you told us and i'm sure it's in here but just for my case

28:26.262 --> 28:50.211
the number of volumes in the chain library uh in the chain library uh we say about 1500 that's including the 229 meta-eva manuscripts but we have all together about 3 000 books printed before 1801 which is still the working definition of a rare book and many of those were given after uh the chain library seems to be

28:50.579 --> 28:55.947
It used to have chains attached to it, so they're all now in our strong room.

28:56.227 --> 28:59.692
I guess one more question before we walk about.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.997
Is the Mappamundi part of your purview as well?

29:03.277 --> 29:04.439
Yes and no.

29:04.459 --> 29:05.420
It's a bit tentative.

29:07.183 --> 29:16.816
I hope I've explained in the book as well, but all the treasures of the Chained Library and the rare books and the Mappamundi now belong to something new called the Mappamundi Trust, which is really a charity.

29:18.138 --> 29:20.181
This is all part of the set-up after this.

29:20.515 --> 29:42.692
So, insofar as it owns an awful lot of our treasures, it's not really a library item as such, although it has been in the library at various points in its past, but it's never been sort of catalogued as a library item.

29:43.381 --> 30:09.490
obviously censoring of the exhibition now but the exhibition is sort of a separate department from the library we're both departments of the cathedral it's a bit complicated but it is interesting though your chained library continues to be a working library well we say that as i said it's not really well you bring it up here i mean the books are still used it's not used as a reading room anymore that's the sad thing but you can't have everything so we like i mean we'll have to think that i mean it's a way of accommodating

30:09.925 --> 30:20.841
the old with the new and the modern needs of the general public who want to come and view the treasures with the continuing needs of people who want to actually have access to the books.

30:20.862 --> 30:28.733
So the building was designed to solve that problem but it is a real problem obviously in historic life as you probably find.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.798
It's wonderful that you've seen books

30:32.268 --> 30:59.659
satisfy both needs well theoretically i mean we've had a lot of we're very proud of the building itself and it's won all sorts of awards and things you know but we've had a lot of problems with the systems of course but that's quite normal and this isn't finished i should have said that straight away that the idea is that there will be shelving cutting off this area into three bits with an office area on either side and then in the middle there will be a sort of extension of the working library which means that we can bring back a lot more of our books just in store

31:00.128 --> 31:02.031
So that's just been hanging over.

31:02.211 --> 31:03.814
We're hoping it'll happen.

31:03.914 --> 31:05.536
It's now due to happen the end of May, I think.

31:07.099 --> 31:11.045
So that's why this place is a bit of a, well, it's obviously our working area, but it is a bit of a mess.

31:12.086 --> 31:18.576
But this is the Dean Lee Library, which was done in 1897, almost exactly 100 years before this new bit.

31:18.674 --> 31:23.081
And that was meant to house the Chained Library as they then knew about it.

31:23.161 --> 31:24.604
That was housed up here.

31:25.004 --> 31:28.770
But that was pre the restoration by Stritia and after Stritia's restoration.

31:28.810 --> 31:30.253
There was no room for it all here anymore.

31:30.293 --> 31:36.342
So half of it went back up to the room where it was on display.

31:36.523 --> 31:38.526
It was the old Newman room above the North Lancet.

31:38.546 --> 31:40.810
And that's where half of it was on display to the public.

31:41.671 --> 31:44.175
So, you know, for the last 60 odd years,

31:44.948 --> 32:08.779
the problem that has been solved by having the library in two places and half the changed library with the bit that was available to tourists and half of the wedding house I'm afraid that physically it's just complicated with history I'm sorry I hope that if you can work it out specifically had I had it before I would have read it before we came I'm delighted we discovered it down below and then just briefly and I'm sure that this is answered in here too

32:08.928 --> 32:12.192
Do we know how the cathedral got the map on Monday?

32:12.312 --> 32:13.093
No, basically.

32:13.113 --> 32:15.136
There's no record of it before the 17th century.

32:15.176 --> 32:30.236
There are various suggestions, but it is assumed that it's been here since the Middle Ages, and since shortly after, or even immediately after its actual creation.

32:31.057 --> 32:33.720
But there's a lot of speculation and arguments about that.

32:33.740 --> 32:35.082
One of these wonderful mysteries.

32:35.182 --> 32:37.365
Yes, and people have all sorts of different theories.

32:37.700 --> 32:43.105
If you wanted to see that, we're trying to organise a big conference next year, 1999.

32:43.125 --> 32:50.393
There's going to be an international Mahamundi conference, because there's been so much interest in it generated since it's been in the news.

32:50.413 --> 32:53.596
It's amazing how much interest there is, really.

32:54.136 --> 32:58.881
But there's an awful lot that's uncertain about it, and always will be, of course.

32:58.921 --> 32:59.942
So that, anyway.

33:00.142 --> 33:00.603
That's great.

33:00.623 --> 33:02.745
All right, thank you.

33:07.079 --> 33:09.783
Actually, that's a mystery.

33:09.803 --> 33:12.067
I was rather astonished when I read the stone.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.591
Oh, well, but he's since he's come out modernity.

33:14.651 --> 33:18.637
His wife, Sabine, came on that occasion instead.

33:18.757 --> 33:21.922
And he's since he's married then, he's come out wonderfully.

33:21.942 --> 33:27.291
And when the Queen opened the building and presented it over, there's a book and everything.

33:27.311 --> 33:32.880
But you see there, this is all this great mystery.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.302
He's there surrounded.

33:34.737 --> 33:40.044
And that really means a knighthood.

33:40.124 --> 33:44.170
So he should have been a sir, but he couldn't be a sir because he wasn't a British citizen.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.313
But now that he's become a British citizen, he's become a sir.

33:46.393 --> 33:51.340
So he's now a sir of the... I don't think it's what I'm saying for Jason or for Paul.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.524
I think he goes by Paul Getty, actually.

33:54.544 --> 33:56.687
Anyway, we just don't think he's the best thing.

33:56.707 --> 34:00.052
He's quite a wonderful good man, too.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.814
Oh, yeah.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.276
Oh, it was very humiliating when...

34:03.965 --> 34:11.111
and his secretary and his assistant came round and he showed them all our specialties.

34:11.291 --> 34:13.198
Oh yes, Mr Gettys, he's got one of those.

34:13.837 --> 34:19.449
That's three hours.

34:19.629 --> 34:34.039
Are they natives that are very frequently?

34:34.019 --> 34:43.233
I'm not sure when you're a producer.

34:43.253 --> 34:46.278
Excuse me.

34:46.298 --> 34:49.944
Do you have to do much of something wrong?

34:50.465 --> 34:50.605
No.

34:51.286 --> 34:58.457
Well, it's really difficult to... If I'm just going to walk with me.

34:58.690 --> 35:14.033
The lighting is too hot to see it.

35:15.255 --> 35:18.079
She's awake.

35:20.143 --> 35:27.634
I think all about here we left my side.

35:27.614 --> 35:46.602
We think that this is a book chest, although the chapters rather than the archive think it was a great chest for the archive, but it's certainly a very fine 14th century chest.

35:47.105 --> 35:50.651
So either books are archived.

35:50.671 --> 35:53.115
But you see the locks are all numbered.

35:53.135 --> 35:57.181
There are three different keys, which would be in the possession of a different person.

35:57.201 --> 36:04.152
So you couldn't have anyone... Very early... How is the expression?

36:05.313 --> 36:07.718
I forget the phrase that you used, but checks on each other.

36:07.738 --> 36:09.040
So you have three different keys.

36:09.160 --> 36:09.982
Well, exactly.

36:10.102 --> 36:13.729
One person can't open, and every other person's compartmentalizing.

36:13.749 --> 36:19.461
The model was called the cloister, so it's just... This is beautiful.

36:19.541 --> 36:20.723
It's been restored.

36:20.703 --> 36:24.607
Well, it was first restored in the late 1890s, 1899s.

36:24.627 --> 36:29.311
Different people were responsible for paying for different days, or it was restored on their behalf.

36:29.791 --> 36:36.137
And that was when the Dean, you know, shortly after the Dean Lee Library was built, the 19th century library, so it was an association with that.

36:36.157 --> 36:37.798
So this might be another book chest?

36:37.818 --> 36:39.920
Yes, again, probably a book chest.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.302
And this is to carry it?

36:41.322 --> 36:42.883
It's a mobile library, yes.

36:43.143 --> 36:44.364
Oh, that's wonderful.

36:44.384 --> 36:50.710
There's a bit of a photograph, we couldn't find a better one than showing the two birds, and it's 1930s carrying it, so we just left that in.

36:50.690 --> 37:01.287
And this actually, although it uses some of the early wood from the changed lives, it's only a mock-up.

37:01.307 --> 37:06.736
It's to give people the ability to see how the changed lives would work.

37:06.776 --> 37:10.842
The idea is to distract them from wanting to handle the real things.

37:10.822 --> 37:15.047
We did want to have a real book as well.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.430
But it was designed based on an actual book.

37:19.692 --> 37:22.435
Just to give you an idea of how it really should be that book.

37:22.515 --> 37:28.061
Is this an original... This end is actually possibly a bit of woodwork.

37:28.141 --> 37:33.947
You can see there's been some paving on the top, but the rest of it is all... You can see it's a bit older.

37:33.967 --> 37:37.051
We did have a kind of a catalogue.

37:37.071 --> 37:38.432
That's right.

37:38.615 --> 37:54.327
And this is actually the list of the actual... I mean, it is done by a political for the exhibition, but it does actually list the actual manuscripts that were in case P. But you see this is the principle of how the claiming works.

37:54.808 --> 37:58.395
And the foreword displays answers.

37:59.270 --> 38:09.058
And this lock is to... Yes, I'm sorry I can't demonstrate it.

38:09.118 --> 38:17.706
This one wouldn't work anyway, but there is a key that we have that unlocks that.

38:17.986 --> 38:23.290
That was only when you're actually taking books off or adding them.

38:23.911 --> 38:28.635
It releases the two hats which came to the top of the bottom, and that releases the barge.

38:28.615 --> 38:32.043
This one is actually chained to the bottom bar, but you can't see so much.

38:32.063 --> 38:37.997
But one end of the chain went along the bars, and the other end is attached to the book.

38:38.799 --> 38:40.262
Yes, I would just wish...

38:40.563 --> 38:53.302
I'm just talking about libraries, not the map at the moment.

38:53.362 --> 39:04.117
You're very welcome to listen if you want.

39:04.458 --> 39:09.405
This is the all-paint chain library which I mentioned, which was the one

39:09.385 --> 39:16.234
at the Church of All Saints, which is along the spire, you can just see the spires at the end of all of this.

39:16.615 --> 39:27.128
And that is written by Dr. Brewster, the gentleman of the portrait, who is a parishioner of All Saints Parish, and a great book collector.

39:27.208 --> 39:39.004
And this is not something like you just gave the All Saints, his theological books, basically, and they're still full of much more interesting things than we have in the main chains, aren't we?

39:39.322 --> 40:02.173
It's a nice contrast because they're much more person-sized books, there's much more quarters and octavos than you'd have in the main chain library.

40:02.423 --> 40:05.067
and also much more than used as well.

40:05.688 --> 40:07.170
So it's just a nice contrast.

40:07.191 --> 40:12.519
It's a private library as compared to... And this is all authentic fitting furniture, right?

40:12.699 --> 40:14.983
Well, I'm not certain.

40:15.003 --> 40:15.964
I wouldn't like to comment.

40:16.125 --> 40:27.182
I think the tables are probably later, but I think certainly most of the wood in the actual cases, but those tables look later to me, but I haven't heard at all further to comment on them, so I wouldn't like to...

40:27.162 --> 40:56.072
So how many of the chained presses did you move down here?

40:56.322 --> 40:57.423
Into this space?

40:59.325 --> 41:00.346
Into this space, sorry.

41:00.726 --> 41:00.966
Yes.

41:01.307 --> 41:04.650
Is that all the chain suppressors that are here?

41:04.690 --> 41:06.171
That is the All Saints chain line.

41:06.211 --> 41:08.373
Oh, that's the All Saints?

41:08.393 --> 41:08.473
Yes.

41:08.494 --> 41:09.615
So that's all of it.

41:09.635 --> 41:09.895
I see.

41:10.095 --> 41:11.296
I mean, the All Saints.

41:11.396 --> 41:11.717
I get it.

41:11.857 --> 41:12.117
Okay.

41:13.839 --> 41:14.099
I see.

41:14.159 --> 41:15.660
So that's just an hors d'oeuvre.

41:15.760 --> 41:22.186
So, how do you do that on that thing?

41:22.206 --> 41:23.187
Just do it.

41:23.207 --> 41:23.308
Okay.

41:23.328 --> 41:23.848
Thank you.

41:25.195 --> 41:31.684
No, that's fine.

41:32.585 --> 41:39.695
But that's it.

41:39.935 --> 41:48.587
Extraordinary.

41:49.090 --> 42:15.098
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:16.462 --> 42:21.247
The more atmosphere it means.

42:21.708 --> 42:24.291
And that's our most destination management.

42:24.531 --> 42:25.952
Absolutely.

42:26.053 --> 42:42.030
And this is the heart of the manifestation.

42:42.010 --> 42:53.284
And as you can see they've designed the room so it's suitable for a 17th century library without actually being a pastiche.

42:53.304 --> 42:59.172
We think it's quite beautiful in its own life without being sort of aggressively different.

42:59.532 --> 43:07.022
It still gives me a bit of a thrill because it is the first time they've all been together again

43:07.205 --> 43:09.771
We moved out of the Lady of Chapel in 1841.

43:09.791 --> 43:12.819
So the Queen came up to open this two years ago?

43:12.839 --> 43:13.300
That's right, yes.

43:14.022 --> 43:16.909
It was rather wonderful.

43:16.929 --> 43:21.060
She had an assembly of baling of stones in another part of the cathedral.

43:21.180 --> 43:23.205
And then she came back to the exhibition in Italy.

43:23.472 --> 43:41.818
different people and ended up in the chain gallery and then went out to the service in the creval and while she was at the service the masons dashed through with the stones and mounted them on the wall in time for all the distinguished guests who came after the service from building the cement was still west of the town
