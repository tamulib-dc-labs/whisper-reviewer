00:03.237 --> 00:13.314
There is a grant of $734,000 from the Mellon Foundation for us in the AHA to launch this prize program.

00:13.334 --> 00:16.259
It will be a prize competition for the best dissertations.

00:16.459 --> 00:26.376
The prize is $20,000, which should be used for converting the raw dissertation into a high-quality electronic book.

00:27.217 --> 00:36.908
And there is also a subsidy given to the Columbia University Press to develop its infrastructure for producing these books.

00:37.509 --> 00:52.026
Now, this isn't going to solve everything, but we hope it will provide a model for high-quality electronic publishing and will show that scholars can gain some control over this new medium.

00:52.343 --> 01:07.427
good enough to the American Council of Learning Societies that they, and they were working on the same set of problems, that they said, well, we're going to develop a program for mature scholars to do e-books.

01:07.447 --> 01:17.423
And they are now in the last stages of perfecting that proposal, which is also going to the Mellon Foundation,

01:18.618 --> 01:21.261
But what they need is someone to write the damn thing.

01:21.281 --> 01:24.466
So they pointed a finger at me.

01:24.486 --> 01:27.249
Since I was, you know, asked my advice along the way.

01:28.110 --> 01:30.433
Since you're the troublemaker, right?

01:30.453 --> 01:31.054
I'm teasing.

01:31.074 --> 01:32.596
And they said, you do one.

01:32.616 --> 01:33.637
You should.

01:33.658 --> 01:34.579
And then I thought about it.

01:34.599 --> 01:47.916
And I thought, you know, if I did such a book, I could get across the richness of the material in these 50,000 letters in Switzerland and whatever it is, 20,000 more I've read in Paris.

01:48.554 --> 01:51.338
I couldn't print them all or put them all online.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.881
That's too big a job.

01:52.901 --> 02:02.937
But I could get across the full richness of the documentary base for the argument I'm trying to make.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.383
And I can do that by creating a new kind of book.

02:06.423 --> 02:07.905
So that's what I'm now doing.

02:07.925 --> 02:09.668
Do you have a provisional title for this?

02:13.900 --> 02:15.222
No, I don't.

02:15.322 --> 02:24.116
I've tried various titles, but somewhere I want to get the idea of an electronic book about books in the Age of Enlightenment.

02:24.136 --> 02:26.439
Wow.

02:26.459 --> 02:28.001
When are you projecting publication?

02:28.883 --> 02:29.283
When?

02:29.303 --> 02:29.524
Yeah.

02:30.085 --> 02:34.291
Well, maybe, if I'm lucky, three years from now.

02:34.331 --> 02:34.571
Oh.

02:34.591 --> 02:42.844
Because I've read all the archives, but after writing two full-scale books on this, I plan to do a trilogy.

02:43.094 --> 02:50.480
And I wrote the first two volumes, one in the Encyclopédie, and the other in the Forbidden Books of Pre-Revolutionary France.

02:50.941 --> 02:56.926
But that left the bulk of the material untreated.

02:58.227 --> 03:05.894
And at that point, I said, are you going to spend the rest of your life as a chronicler of the Société d'Antiquité, really what you just said to me?

03:06.874 --> 03:09.237
And I thought, life is short.

03:10.077 --> 03:12.139
I want to try out some other things.

03:12.507 --> 03:15.250
I let my index cards sit in drawers.

03:15.270 --> 03:22.397
I have thousands of them for many years, thinking I would write volume three when I retired.

03:23.999 --> 03:36.491
And that was my plan until the people at the ACLS said, we really need someone to try to do one of these electronic books.

03:36.511 --> 03:42.177
And then when I thought about it, I realized, I think I realized, I may be wrong, that

03:42.612 --> 03:48.224
My subject lends itself perfectly to this kind of electronic book.

03:48.244 --> 03:49.687
I described it.

03:49.807 --> 03:51.952
I think I mentioned this in the piece.

03:52.513 --> 03:53.095
You did.

03:53.115 --> 04:02.595
It's a pyramid structure, the top layer, being the main narrative that will come out simultaneously as a normal codex.

04:02.963 --> 04:16.872
But then there will be a series of layers underneath that in which I will have many monographs and documents and historiographical discussions and all kinds of things that will, I hope, do justice to the

04:18.893 --> 04:21.277
This is just so perfect for this chapter that I'm writing.

04:21.317 --> 04:28.488
I won't bore you with the details, but I just can't tell you how this works into precisely what I'm trying to do here.

04:28.748 --> 04:30.771
What is the chapter?

04:30.791 --> 04:35.939
Well, this is the concluding chapter of my book, and making an accommodation with the future.

04:39.945 --> 04:40.806
Well, that's it.

04:40.866 --> 04:42.589
You just told me precisely...

04:42.569 --> 04:44.932
what you're doing.

04:44.952 --> 04:49.278
I think it was Dr. Billington who made this comparison.

04:49.318 --> 04:54.585
It may not have been, but it was somebody whose opinion I really trust and respect.

04:54.605 --> 05:06.741
But this person suggested that what the electronic book might actually be doing is to freeing the printed book to really achieve its destiny, its greatness.

05:07.242 --> 05:09.505
And he made the comparison, you know, when the

05:09.485 --> 05:22.442
when the camera was, the daguerreotype was invented in 1839, I mean, there were fears were rampant among the painters, the artists of the day, that this was the end, you know, that they would be put out of business.

05:22.482 --> 05:25.886
And what it actually did was allow them to explore new areas.

05:26.087 --> 05:32.495
And I don't know, maybe it's too simple a parallel, but I wonder, you know, what you think about that.

05:32.615 --> 05:33.556
I like the parallel.

05:33.576 --> 05:36.140
I think it's illuminating.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.783
No parallels exactly fit anything else, but

05:39.286 --> 05:42.590
I think that is, in fact, exactly the case.

05:42.610 --> 05:49.617
So that it's quite wrong to imagine a fight to the death between the printed book and the electronic book.

05:49.637 --> 06:00.049
It seems to me they are complementary, and that the electronic book is going to open up new possibilities for the printed book, even new ways of reading.

06:00.069 --> 06:05.074
So I think what I imagine the reader of my future e-book

06:06.202 --> 06:24.945
doing will be to, let us say, read horizontally through the standard narrative from one chapter to the next until he or she comes upon something that intrigues him or her and then clicks onto a link to a level below that.

06:25.966 --> 06:29.691
So let us say he comes upon book smuggling.

06:29.711 --> 06:31.052
It's a wonderful subject.

06:31.092 --> 06:35.618
We know next to nothing about smuggling in general, not to say nothing about book smuggling.

06:36.425 --> 06:50.228
And I could go on and on about it, but the point is I will try to press into one chapter an account of book smuggling during the 20 years before the French Revolution.

06:50.248 --> 07:01.808
But there are hundreds and hundreds of letters of book smugglers in these archives in Switzerland and in other letters in Paris by the police when they catch one of them.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.943
and so on.

07:03.963 --> 07:14.434
You know, you can reconstruct the roots and economics of it, and the kind of cannon-mouse game played by police and professionals, et cetera.

07:14.454 --> 07:28.369
So if you're interested in that subject, you click down a link, and then I will write a mini monograph of the technique of book smuggling in Dion, which is peculiarly interesting and special worth discussing.

07:28.737 --> 07:40.691
as opposed to the technique of distance distribution across trade routes to Versailles, which I mentioned earlier.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.214
Versailles is a warehouse.

07:43.234 --> 07:49.141
That's another mini-monogram for Versailles and this woman, Madame Lanoue, that I mentioned.

07:49.161 --> 07:51.904
So there will be a series of mini-monographs.

07:51.984 --> 07:56.770
Maybe each one will be perhaps ten, perhaps pages, perhaps more.

07:57.475 --> 08:10.896
And if the reader is even more intrigued by, let's say, Versailles as a warehouse, the reader can click down yet to another level and read all the letters of Madame Lalou.

08:11.798 --> 08:20.952
And you could even click below that to perhaps other monographs on smuggling or the historiographical

08:21.573 --> 08:27.920
question about the relative importance of the illegal and legal book trade as discussed by other authors.

08:29.221 --> 08:35.328
So you can imagine vertical reading that would accompany horizontal reading.

08:35.488 --> 08:37.811
Or the reader can make his own book.

08:38.631 --> 08:49.403
And in fact, as you know from the research you've done yourself, you can download chunks of a book like this.

08:49.957 --> 08:57.594
and print them out and even have them bound so that you create your own paperback volume.

08:57.614 --> 08:58.035
Exactly.

08:58.857 --> 09:08.860
And, you know, it could be quite different from the paperback top level that I will write because it will be something peculiar to your interests.

09:09.211 --> 09:16.441
So this will, I think, free the book in a way that goes quite parallel.

09:16.461 --> 09:17.042
That's great.

09:17.943 --> 09:21.088
I don't want to overstay my welcome, but I do want to ask you a question.

09:21.128 --> 09:35.067
I'm also doing a chapter on what I call the emigre libraries, and it's an extension of the national libraries, but repositories as expressions of national culture and also the destruction of libraries.

09:35.047 --> 09:50.895
as a means of destroying a people and using as an example Sarajevo or the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and Cornell's subsequent attempt to reseed their collections because they have the finest collection of Southeast Asian.

09:50.935 --> 09:54.000
This is where digital stuff can be very useful, by the way, of course.

09:54.622 --> 10:02.932
where the Khmer Rouge destroyed all of the library collections and every vestige of their literature.

10:03.572 --> 10:09.720
Cornell, now with the new government, has been digitizing stuff and sending it back to Cambodia.

10:09.800 --> 10:10.340
Very interesting.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.923
So I'm writing about that, and I'm writing about Sarajevo.

10:13.504 --> 10:17.929
But I'm also interested in an interview I did with Vartan Gregori, and he mentioned

10:17.909 --> 10:26.987
that when there was no Poland, for instance, during the period of the partition, the de facto National Library was the Bibliothèque Polonaise in Paris.

10:27.468 --> 10:32.417
And you did a wonderful essay in 1981 in the New York Review, and Poland rewrites history.

10:32.457 --> 10:38.349
And you write there about Poland as a country as obsessed with its past as it is worried about its present.

10:38.369 --> 10:39.411
And I just wonder,

10:39.391 --> 10:48.522
Is it a stretch to say that a good deal of the preservation of Polish culture and history was affected by this particular library?

10:48.602 --> 10:50.164
Also, there was another library in St.

10:50.204 --> 10:54.910
Petersburg, for instance, but by these what we might call emigre libraries.

10:56.111 --> 10:57.293
I don't think it's a stretch.

10:57.613 --> 11:07.525
I couldn't prove it, not being a specialist in Polish history, but it seems to me that Poland existed in the minds of Poles and others

11:07.808 --> 11:11.633
after the last of the partitions.

11:11.653 --> 11:20.606
And that had to carry it through until it was recreated after World War I. It existed in its music, too, of course.

11:20.986 --> 11:21.387
Of course.

11:21.607 --> 11:23.410
And its religion as well, as you point out.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.792
Yes.

11:24.812 --> 11:28.537
But I think the book was absolutely central to this.

11:29.238 --> 11:30.880
And where did the book exist?

11:30.900 --> 11:32.302
Well, in libraries.

11:33.103 --> 11:34.305
Also in publishing houses.

11:34.825 --> 12:01.137
And I think something similar happened in a way not exactly the same way after World War II, because you got these reviews devoted to Polish culture, literature, and politics outside of Poland, notably in Paris, that became central rallying points for a

12:01.538 --> 12:07.384
kind of Polish culture that had been repressed by the communist regime.

12:08.465 --> 12:19.497
So the emigre presses, I think, kept alive the rival version of the nation, so to speak, when the nation continued to exist, but as a kind of occupied power.

12:20.778 --> 12:29.908
So I think that the role of emigre libraries, emigre reviews, and literature in general, in the case of Poland, was absolutely

12:30.327 --> 12:32.415
Absolutely crucial.

12:32.435 --> 12:36.812
Now, in the case of Cambodia, I didn't know this, I must admit.

12:37.254 --> 12:39.021
How extensive was the destruction?

12:39.102 --> 12:40.244
Oh, almost total.

12:41.926 --> 12:44.470
Because it was mindful destruction.

12:44.490 --> 12:48.836
I mean, it was not one of the peripheral casualties of war.

12:48.896 --> 12:53.502
I mean, their whole policy was this is the year zero.

12:54.584 --> 12:56.707
And it wasn't just destroying the libraries.

12:56.747 --> 13:02.595
It was killing the librarians and anyone who had this documentation for this.

13:02.575 --> 13:12.992
They would look at you, and if you had these little depressions on your nose, it was evidence that you had reading glasses and that you could read, you know, and you were executed.

13:13.032 --> 13:15.636
So, I mean, it was a quite horribly systematic thing.

13:16.317 --> 13:22.828
I've documented it as much as I can, but mainly to try and profile what Cornell did previously.

13:23.298 --> 13:33.954
And then, of course, I have the Sarajevo, the deliberate destruction of that library, 1.2 million books in one night, which is more than Hitler did in his best day.

13:34.394 --> 13:36.117
He never did that many books in one day.

13:37.258 --> 13:52.140
And then the attempt by the Harvard people to what they call this ingathering, trying to find scholars such as yourself who may have, say, done some work there and made some Xerox copies of things, and maybe they can

13:52.120 --> 13:55.252
So that's a very interesting story, but they'll never replicate it.

13:56.035 --> 14:01.776
Are there estimates about the number of books destroyed?

14:02.026 --> 14:04.889
Cambodia or the number of libraries?

14:04.909 --> 14:05.630
I have no idea.

14:06.711 --> 14:08.032
There was the National Library.

14:08.092 --> 14:10.915
The contents of that were totally destroyed.

14:10.955 --> 14:13.078
The records.

14:13.358 --> 14:16.081
I mean, they evacuated Phnom Penh.

14:16.261 --> 14:21.627
And then they just said about... I could email this.

14:21.767 --> 14:25.931
Did you do email some stuff that I found on this?

14:26.392 --> 14:31.257
I'd be very interested just to have some basic information about it.

14:31.473 --> 14:31.773
Yeah.

14:32.154 --> 14:37.040
Well, if you'd like, I could send you the fragment of the chapter that I've written.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.502
That might even be the best thing.

14:39.383 --> 14:39.483
Yeah.

14:39.523 --> 14:40.064
It's very simple.

14:40.084 --> 14:44.850
It's just darntonatprinceton.edu.

14:44.870 --> 14:45.291
Okay.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.393
Darntonatprinceton.edu.

14:47.894 --> 14:48.094
Yep.

14:48.234 --> 14:48.755
Good.

14:48.775 --> 14:49.656
Well, why don't I do that?

14:50.257 --> 14:54.342
That way you'll... By the way, I described my...

14:54.878 --> 15:03.532
fantasy of writing an e-book of this sort, which is no longer a fantasy because I've started, and an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education.

15:03.552 --> 15:04.434
Okay, and I have access.

15:04.514 --> 15:05.375
How recent was that?

15:07.820 --> 15:08.661
It was quite recent.

15:08.681 --> 15:10.183
It was maybe two months ago.

15:10.204 --> 15:10.865
Okay, good.

15:10.885 --> 15:14.170
I have access to that on the web, so I can.

15:14.190 --> 15:17.596
You might find, I mean, there's described as notion of levels and so on.

15:18.077 --> 15:21.342
I now have actually a team of graduate students.

15:21.828 --> 15:29.460
five of them who are going to be transcribing Xerox manuscript and working with me.

15:29.480 --> 15:43.362
So it'll be a team effort, not at the top basic narrative, which will be the published codex version of things, but the various levels beneath that, I hope, well, that can only be done with the help of other people.

15:43.382 --> 15:43.482
Yeah.

15:44.457 --> 15:45.558
I'll go check that out.

15:46.139 --> 15:47.060
I do have the Chronicle.

15:47.080 --> 15:52.607
I have one other question to ask you because I know it's kept you for a long time.

15:52.727 --> 15:56.291
In your PW interview, you have a wonderful quote in there.

15:56.351 --> 15:58.674
You have fantasies about books all the time.

15:59.435 --> 16:00.376
I love that quotation.

16:00.396 --> 16:04.340
I wonder if you could just briefly expand on what you meant by that.

16:08.745 --> 16:10.307
I have fantasies towards the end of the piece.

16:10.327 --> 16:12.190
I'll have to find it here now.

16:12.210 --> 16:14.312
I've just written it down in my notes here.

16:15.473 --> 16:29.970
Well, I forget, it's no big deal, but it just was kind of a nice... Well, maybe it's... Yeah, I think most authors do spend a lot of time daydreaming about the books they're going to write.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.913
Is it along those lines?

16:31.933 --> 16:40.603
Because I have... I constantly think of why I do the A, and that I could be shape A, and this much better to do B, and so on.

16:41.123 --> 17:03.535
Okay, I've got it here by the way.

17:03.975 --> 17:05.798
So let's just see.

17:06.149 --> 17:07.071
This was in 1995.

17:07.351 --> 17:10.596
You know, we talk about computers are great.

17:10.616 --> 17:15.845
I have a LexisNexis account, you know, and I can just search.

17:16.927 --> 17:19.030
It's amazing the things that you can find, you know.

17:21.014 --> 17:22.817
Where, where, where, where?

17:23.077 --> 17:29.187
I have fantasies about books all the time, Darnton says, about his desire to investigate many subjects.

17:29.470 --> 17:34.166
I would like to write a book about the way people use sex to make sense of life, but I probably never will.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.795
Sex has become a way to explore pleasure and morality.

17:36.836 --> 17:39.565
It is often a vehicle for understanding other things.

17:40.253 --> 17:56.417
citing the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, who says, people think with things, doubt and suggest philosophers and academics think with abstractions, ordinary people use the world about them, objects, stories, and popular motifs, and combine them in a way to make sense of life.

17:56.477 --> 18:00.923
I don't know if that really pertains to fantasies, but it's a great quote.

18:00.943 --> 18:02.005
But that was the context.

18:02.025 --> 18:03.527
Well, of course, you should feel

18:03.507 --> 18:16.950
Yeah, and I really haven't asked you questions about other things because I have the books and no sense in replicating what you've done elsewhere, but I really did want to get into these other things.

18:17.451 --> 18:22.340
I'll be happy to email you that little piece, that little fragment on Cambodia.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.465
It's about 3,000 words, I think, and...

18:25.748 --> 18:37.782
I have to talk with some librarians, I think next week or something like that, so if I can edify them with some of the information you've got up.

18:38.082 --> 18:40.045
Well, would you like to see the Sarajevo thing too?

18:41.106 --> 18:42.648
Well, I'll settle for the Khmer Rouge.

18:42.668 --> 18:43.529
Okay.

18:44.149 --> 18:45.571
I have so few minutes.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.492
Okay, good.

18:46.512 --> 18:54.321
But it's part of the appeal to librarians to not think that they can just digitize the world away.

18:54.706 --> 19:00.592
buying digitizing with respect for the preservation of the book as a physical author.

19:00.672 --> 19:00.913
Yeah.

19:01.313 --> 19:03.896
Because without that, book history is impossible.

19:03.916 --> 19:07.860
I think you'll find this pretty interesting, so I'd be delighted to send it on to you.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.241
Yeah, thanks.

19:08.301 --> 19:09.182
I'm most grateful.

19:09.202 --> 19:10.523
Well, I'm grateful for the time.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.287
It's a wonderful book you're doing.

19:14.307 --> 19:14.788
I can't wait to read it.

19:14.808 --> 19:15.148
Thank you.

19:15.629 --> 19:21.615
Well, I'm going to finish it this summer, the Lord willing, and I'm changing publishers as we speak.

19:21.755 --> 19:23.397
Who's your new publisher?

19:23.849 --> 19:28.657
Well, I haven't moved yet, but I'm going over to Viking, I believe.

19:28.857 --> 19:39.514
I've been orphaned a couple of times with editors leaving, and it's awfully depressing to have to start explaining what you're doing over again.

19:40.416 --> 19:44.903
I'm with Holt, and we did very well with my first book, I must say.

19:45.063 --> 19:47.106
It's still in print, and the paperback just came out.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.350
I'm going to shut off the tape recorder now.
