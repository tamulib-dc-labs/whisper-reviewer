00:03.963 --> 00:25.930
Well, the point about the Richter was that he had memorized the classical repertory, which is all the Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, Scherbert sonatas, piano works, and then he dies, and I imagine his brain goes off much like a television set.

00:26.731 --> 00:29.915
So all those memories are gone.

00:30.015 --> 00:33.379
That great library in Richter's head is gone.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.554
when I read the Milton thing, because that scared me.

00:37.134 --> 00:37.915
That really scared me.

00:37.935 --> 00:38.817
Where did that go?

00:39.157 --> 00:41.480
It's gone.

00:42.241 --> 00:50.493
But the Milton thing of what books are, which is what, if Richter could have written it down, we would have known.

00:50.553 --> 00:53.717
But he didn't have to write it down because he was a pianist.

00:53.737 --> 00:56.201
So we can listen to him play it and imagine anything we like.

00:56.842 --> 00:58.624
But I am now past

00:58.908 --> 01:07.577
two years have been entirely absorbed, and I'm even obsessed with reading Shakespeare and Keats, for very personal reasons.

01:07.977 --> 01:13.143
And now, in fact, I have a list that I want to show you.

01:13.303 --> 01:15.285
Maybe you can help me track certain things.

01:15.705 --> 01:17.667
Keats now is critical to me.

01:17.808 --> 01:18.148
Keats?

01:18.308 --> 01:19.449
Keats is critical to me.

01:20.330 --> 01:27.818
And it's partly from my having gotten over an inhibition of reading great poetry, because, you know,

01:28.912 --> 01:36.822
My lack of a college education always made me presume that if you didn't go to college, don't try to read The Great Masters, because that would be beyond you.

01:36.842 --> 01:39.606
But I'm getting over that.

01:40.787 --> 01:46.154
And so even reading Shakespeare seriously is having gotten over that inhibition.

01:47.016 --> 01:58.851
And certainly Keats and Wordsworth, but the point of it is that in reading them, the purpose always is to find...

01:59.101 --> 02:01.163
what you're looking for in yourself in them.

02:01.703 --> 02:03.385
That's how I'd always done it.

02:03.405 --> 02:24.085
If I was illustrating a book, then I'd look at William Blake, and I'd look at Goya, whoever, always with the joy of looking at work, but always with the not-quite-unconscious motivation that I will find me here, and I will take it, and I will use it for my own purposes.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.967
But what at this point has brought you to Shakespeare and Keats?

02:26.987 --> 02:28.669
It's very interesting to me.

02:29.729 --> 02:31.912
Shakespeare didn't have a university education either.

02:32.072 --> 02:32.472
I know.

02:32.653 --> 02:48.252
And in fact, it was so amusing because once I began to read about everything about him, that amused me a good deal that the critics of the time and other playwrights of the time were very snotty and contemptuous of his lack of good Latin because he didn't go to a proper Latin school.

02:48.272 --> 02:49.133
Yeah, exactly.

02:49.453 --> 02:54.179
And so that was lovely to find the man I'm afraid of was as uneducated as I am probably.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.643
But that's funny inhibition about...

02:58.062 --> 03:05.955
Because I refused to go to college, and it hurt my father very much because of the three children, me being the youngest, I was the only one he could afford to.

03:06.496 --> 03:10.442
He couldn't send my sister, he couldn't send my older brother, and I was the one who didn't want it.

03:11.003 --> 03:12.726
So it was a slap in his face.

03:12.806 --> 03:17.854
My sister would have given anything, but in those days it was worthless sending girls to college.

03:17.874 --> 03:19.116
They were going to get married.

03:19.236 --> 03:20.478
I mean, what else do girls do?

03:21.059 --> 03:25.386
So she, who was probably intellectually the most brilliant of the three of us, was totally...

03:26.007 --> 03:29.191
But you had such a passion for books and for reading.

03:29.231 --> 03:31.153
Why didn't you want a formal education?

03:31.234 --> 03:32.755
I just wanted to work.

03:32.776 --> 03:39.023
And, well, more to the point was an almost congenital hatred of school.

03:39.043 --> 03:40.385
I hated school.

03:40.746 --> 03:42.267
I hated the confinement of school.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.771
And don't forget, we're talking about the 30s now.

03:44.811 --> 03:50.698
Now there's a certain concern for children who don't quite fit in or conform.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.290
There's such a thing as reading disabilities.

03:53.350 --> 03:55.994
We know all kinds of subtleties about handling children.

03:56.034 --> 03:57.616
Not then.

03:57.636 --> 03:59.278
You were just herded into a room.

03:59.719 --> 04:01.561
You were thrown into competition.

04:01.581 --> 04:04.285
The smart one sat in the front of the class.

04:04.325 --> 04:11.374
The dumb one sat in the back of the class, where I mostly sat, because I was numb with anxiety at the endless competition.

04:12.236 --> 04:14.258
So there was no pleasure at all.

04:14.318 --> 04:15.480
It was no fun at all.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.023
And to me, I didn't want to go to art school.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.285
I was still schooled.

04:19.957 --> 04:22.821
I went to the Art Students League simply to quiet my father.

04:24.744 --> 04:30.453
But then you are really the product of your reading, of your observation of other artists.

04:30.473 --> 04:32.696
And ripping off everybody who kept coming.

04:32.896 --> 04:33.798
Shamelessly, right?

04:33.818 --> 04:34.479
Shamelessly.

04:35.280 --> 04:46.016
And one of the things you like, and we will get a Jim Marshall question in now, one of the things you say you admired most, like your good friend Jim Marshall's work, is that he borrowed.

04:46.357 --> 04:49.221
He stole as ferociously as I did.

04:49.589 --> 05:00.179
And we were both excellent thieves, which is one of the reasons we were excellent friends, because thievery in that department is utterly necessary to the creative act.

05:00.679 --> 05:04.563
The whole point is that when you steal something, you cook it, and it becomes you.

05:05.504 --> 05:09.808
If you can't cook it and make it become you, then you're just a cheap crook.

05:10.689 --> 05:12.571
And there are lots of those around, too, as we know.

05:12.631 --> 05:15.533
Some people borrow styles, and it's revolting.

05:16.014 --> 05:19.377
But we prided ourselves on our adroitness,

05:19.694 --> 05:27.284
We were really top-notch thieves, because we could take something, and there was enough of ourselves going, boiling with excitement.

05:27.584 --> 05:30.909
It is like putting it into a night kitchen.

05:30.929 --> 05:37.297
That's where that comes from, a night kitchen cooking pot, and serving it up, voila, a whole new dish.

05:37.678 --> 05:43.546
It's Jim Marshall, or it's me, or any one of the few really terrific people who did books for kids.

05:44.547 --> 05:46.950
Jim was probably best at that,

05:48.517 --> 05:58.909
because he added to it an incredible intellect, an incredible cultivated sensibility, which made his turning it into himself something marvelous.

05:59.750 --> 06:05.876
Because what I envied him about, a number of things, but was the simplicity of it.

06:05.896 --> 06:06.858
Just making sure.

06:07.358 --> 06:08.519
I mean, it's fine.

06:08.539 --> 06:11.102
This is a very warm tribute, and of course this is the 20th.

06:11.282 --> 06:13.545
Let's get rid of the martial arts if you can.

06:14.133 --> 06:17.036
as I did promise Sandy Gore I might do this.

06:17.076 --> 06:17.977
No, and I wanted to.

06:17.997 --> 06:19.178
It's very important.

06:19.198 --> 06:22.180
And this is for my column, which would be a nice 900-word column.

06:22.201 --> 06:26.444
I've got two papers in Connecticut, by the way, and I'll certainly make sure you get tear sheets.

06:27.886 --> 06:29.287
But this is a very warm tribute.

06:29.427 --> 06:32.991
It's the 25th anniversary, I guess, of George and Martha.

06:33.491 --> 06:37.755
And, of course, when you look at these pictures, they seem very simple, don't they?

06:37.855 --> 06:38.115
Yeah.

06:38.235 --> 06:39.216
Just very spare.

06:39.617 --> 06:41.018
Yeah, but that's a great...

06:41.757 --> 06:48.143
adroit beauty of it, that he was not an egotist, he was not a show-off.

06:48.163 --> 06:49.945
Aesthetically, he was so principled.

06:50.005 --> 06:52.147
And the amazing thing is that he started that way.

06:52.187 --> 06:55.771
He wasn't like an artist groping and coming to style.

06:56.271 --> 06:58.954
Jim just came out in full bloom.

06:58.974 --> 07:04.099
When you think how early George and Martha is and how they were already hip, yes, there were refinements.

07:04.159 --> 07:09.925
The Brother Goosebook that came years later is ultra wonderfully refined, but it's all there.

07:10.276 --> 07:19.927
It's one of those rare things, because he was so smart, so verbal, so quick, loved the arts, music, opera, books.

07:20.387 --> 07:28.717
I mean, our conversations on the phone had all to do with music we're listening to, what we were reading, what performances of what we were going to go see.

07:28.737 --> 07:39.709
I mean, he frankly was the only colleague I had in the entire profession where we shared such complicated and lovely interests.

07:40.263 --> 07:43.028
You do say that you believe he's the last.

07:43.649 --> 07:44.169
Yes, I do.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.974
And this is... Oh, that's not hyperbole.

07:46.994 --> 07:47.755
It's not hyperbole.

07:47.775 --> 07:49.098
No, that is not hyperbole.

07:49.618 --> 07:52.223
That article I wrote, it was hard writing.

07:52.263 --> 07:56.049
I rewrote it a dozen times just to make sure there was no hyperbole.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.753
What is happening in the industry now, you know.

07:59.134 --> 07:59.475
We all know.

07:59.635 --> 08:01.698
It is the death of publishing as we knew it.

08:02.159 --> 08:02.740
Let's face it.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.182
It is kaput.

08:04.202 --> 08:04.603
Really?

08:04.683 --> 08:05.524
Yeah.

08:05.545 --> 08:05.865
Yeah.

08:06.385 --> 08:24.683
Certainly as I knew it, certainly a young person coming in as I did in the 50s, I doubt why things would be published now, since most publishers are desperate to keep a bottom line just to sell books, just to stay alive.

08:25.023 --> 08:28.867
You think they're going to experiment with anything off the wall?

08:29.748 --> 08:30.829
It's not possible.

08:31.569 --> 08:35.413
Jim, now I was a lucky kid, lucky dumb kid.

08:35.849 --> 08:41.996
I came into the early 50s, just children's book industry started in the 40s in America.

08:42.016 --> 08:51.146
Bill Scott, who just died last week, broke my heart to read that, began it all with William R. Scott books and Margaret Weisbrown and Bruce Krauss.

08:52.187 --> 08:59.976
I came in maybe five, seven years after the industry began, which was just coincided with roughly the end of World War II.

08:59.996 --> 09:01.077
The industry as we know it.

09:01.097 --> 09:01.998
I mean, there have been children's books.

09:02.018 --> 09:02.939
The industry, yes, of course.

09:03.060 --> 09:05.282
I'm talking about the picture book industry,

09:05.566 --> 09:11.411
The business of picture books as a publishing industry where you can make money viable.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.514
There was always, of course, but there were scatterings.

09:14.574 --> 09:20.340
There was no, I think Bill pulled it together, whether he was conscious of doing that or not.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.844
But he started a new industry, which was the picture book industry, as we know it.

09:25.404 --> 09:28.607
And when I came in, it was just gusting into life.

09:29.428 --> 09:30.469
And everybody was there.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.632
And I was this dumb kid from Brooklyn.

09:34.237 --> 09:45.395
And I had Ruth Krauss, and I had Ursula Nordstrom, I had Crockett Johnson, I had Dr. Seuss, I had, oh, you give up, I had, they're all there, older people, took me on.

09:46.076 --> 09:58.877
They all took me home with them, they all stuck, I had Leonard Weisgard, who, thanks to him, literally took me home, and showed me how to do color separations, and told me how to read, and told me how to look at pictures.

09:59.397 --> 10:01.700
I was an apprentice.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.302
This is an apprenticeship.

10:03.322 --> 10:04.964
I was an apprenticeship for 10 years.

10:05.625 --> 10:08.769
I was apprentice to Ursula Nordstrom at Harper's.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.291
I did any book she told me.

10:10.471 --> 10:11.272
I had no taste.

10:11.773 --> 10:13.575
I had no definition of what I was doing.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.217
She said, Maurice, do this.

10:16.058 --> 10:17.280
And then I want you to do that.

10:17.980 --> 10:19.402
And I said, I can't draw that.

10:19.442 --> 10:20.383
And she said, do it.

10:20.824 --> 10:22.166
You don't want to just draw that.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.567
You want to draw this, too.

10:23.948 --> 10:24.789
I was trained.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.953
So by the time the 50s were over,

10:28.287 --> 10:34.353
beginning of the 60s, starting roughly with the Nutshell Library, I was blooming into an artist.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.795
Late bloomer.

10:35.855 --> 10:38.598
Unlike Jim, who was an early bloomer, I was a late bloomer.

10:39.319 --> 10:43.563
Fortunately for me, I lived long enough so that I bloomed at all.

10:44.704 --> 10:54.615
But that whole period of 60s, fabulous, the world was insane, but publishing was heaven.

10:55.203 --> 11:06.439
And if you do all the crazy books you want, all the great Ruth Krauss books, the books I was allowed to do, which were considered peculiar, were denounced and banned and all that nonsense, still you could do it.

11:07.080 --> 11:19.257
And that lasted right through to the end of the 60s, and we got to peter out towards the 70s when children's books began to make too much money, and we drew the attention of the wrong people.

11:19.277 --> 11:21.160
We drew the attention of the suits.

11:21.663 --> 11:24.588
Because mostly women ran these large departments.

11:24.748 --> 11:25.169
And why?

11:25.229 --> 11:26.611
Because the men wouldn't be caught dead.

11:26.911 --> 11:33.822
And the kiddie book department was like the nursery in the third floor.

11:33.842 --> 11:37.528
You never ran into the grown-up people publishing parties.

11:38.510 --> 11:40.553
And that was a mistake.

11:41.314 --> 11:44.539
We were having such a good time that we were being profitable.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.006
And by being profitable, the men began to sniff.

11:49.026 --> 11:49.527
Not the

11:50.165 --> 11:53.370
the books that began to slip, the money that was coming in.

11:53.670 --> 11:55.894
I'm laying on the table once I really can't stop.

11:55.914 --> 11:56.935
Okay, could you just handle lunch?

11:57.837 --> 11:58.418
Just bring it out?

11:58.878 --> 12:00.301
Thank you.

12:01.943 --> 12:02.604
That was the end.

12:03.405 --> 12:04.547
No, it was the beginning of the end.

12:05.208 --> 12:12.660
Beginning of the end was when Ursula was retired, as far as I'm concerned, mostly unwillingly.

12:13.401 --> 12:16.746
And she became a pain.

12:17.401 --> 12:22.147
her perfectionism, her fanaticism, Nordstrom.

12:22.908 --> 12:31.840
And then things began to change very, very rapidly, and it became a much more, I'm giving you a very rough, gross, generalized overview of the whole thing.

12:32.340 --> 12:38.508
But then becoming an apprentice in the 70s and 80s was getting harder and harder.

12:38.869 --> 12:45.838
You had to come in, and you had to load the cannon and shoot your first book out and be a success in order to get a second book.

12:46.949 --> 12:48.672
It's even worse now.

12:48.692 --> 12:49.793
It's even worse now.

12:49.813 --> 12:51.396
So you've got to score in the first time.

12:51.776 --> 12:58.386
We are on a level of Hollywood now, where you read the thing, the movie comes out on the weekend, and it doesn't make big bucks.

12:58.787 --> 13:02.192
And even the New York Times tells you how much money Men in Black made.

13:02.412 --> 13:03.734
The New York Times is doing that.

13:03.794 --> 13:04.996
That's amazing.

13:05.016 --> 13:05.257
Right.

13:06.258 --> 13:07.841
It's exactly the same in publishing.

13:08.061 --> 13:11.766
If you don't make it on the first few days out, I'm exaggerating, only slightly.

13:11.786 --> 13:12.147
It's true, though.

13:12.751 --> 13:13.172
You're done.

13:13.192 --> 13:13.752
You're screwed.

13:13.772 --> 13:15.735
They're not going to publish you again.

13:15.795 --> 13:23.867
A book's life now can be 30 days, 45 days, and if it's not selling with this return policy, it's back.

13:24.468 --> 13:25.309
They don't even want to return.

13:25.329 --> 13:26.110
They've got a pulpit.

13:26.230 --> 13:26.931
They've got a pulpit.

13:26.971 --> 13:38.228
We used to have books that were on the list forever, and if you didn't sell, well, it'll... Look, if this had happened to me, Night Kitchen didn't sell for years afterwards because of the scandal that arose.

13:38.468 --> 13:39.990
Anyway, please take free software.

13:41.506 --> 13:42.447
Thank you.

13:42.487 --> 13:45.330
Maybe you should bring in another.

13:45.350 --> 13:45.690
No, it's not yet.

13:45.710 --> 13:46.991
Thank you very much.

13:48.052 --> 13:59.544
How do you respond to a, and I'm not going to put you into a, you know, crossfire fire, but I did an interview with Anita Sylvie, an incredibly capable woman.

13:59.564 --> 14:01.385
Yeah, she's a very capable woman.

14:01.646 --> 14:03.527
It's her, and she's of course at Hope Mifflin now.

14:04.228 --> 14:08.352
It's her belief that we're in a, and I didn't even think we'd be getting into this, but it's very interesting.

14:08.572 --> 14:11.395
It's her belief that we're in a new golden age of children's books.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.144
How do you respond to that?

14:15.184 --> 14:19.490
She's talking, of course, technology that makes wonderful stuff available.

14:20.371 --> 14:24.737
The artists who she says are now being attracted to the field.

14:25.859 --> 14:33.168
I will preface what I'm about to say with I'm a 69-year-old man who lives in the country and is absorbed in my own work, in my own reading.

14:33.228 --> 14:39.036
So I say that only to clarify that I don't know what's going on in the real world, okay?

14:39.617 --> 14:40.238
I admit that.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.239
I don't watch TV.

14:41.259 --> 14:41.820
I don't dare.

14:42.914 --> 14:43.835
But I don't agree with her.

14:44.777 --> 14:46.399
I respect Anita tremendously.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.042
We work together on Jim's book.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.485
I don't see a new world at all.

14:50.505 --> 14:51.727
The golden age, you say.

14:53.009 --> 14:54.491
Look, I'm getting older all the time.

14:54.511 --> 14:55.473
I'm in my golden years.

14:55.533 --> 14:59.259
If these are the golden years, give me a raise and I'll slit my wrists.

14:59.279 --> 15:01.762
I mean, getting old ain't perfection at all.

15:02.183 --> 15:04.627
I don't know what she sees that I don't see.

15:04.887 --> 15:08.753
All I see is a beautiful industry crashing.

15:09.774 --> 15:10.375
Crashing.

15:10.916 --> 15:11.537
How...

15:11.770 --> 15:12.711
Do kids grow?

15:12.951 --> 15:19.077
How do they have the time that I have to be apprenticed and work out and become fully developed artists?

15:19.097 --> 15:19.998
There isn't that time.

15:20.599 --> 15:24.282
I defy her to contradict me and tell me where that time is.

15:24.382 --> 15:33.091
I think probably what she said in the next breath was, well, of course, children's books now account for perhaps 20%.

15:33.391 --> 15:37.074
That goes back to what you were saying earlier of the sales.

15:37.455 --> 15:38.696
Okay.

15:39.657 --> 15:40.798
The sales ain't there.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.022
If the sales ain't there, the books ain't there.

15:43.043 --> 15:55.842
But maybe that's what she means by, you know, the... Well, also, maybe also between me and you, and you'll eradicate this on your tape, she doesn't have the freedom to say what I'm saying.

15:56.043 --> 15:56.664
That's right.

15:56.884 --> 15:57.925
She's a publisher.

15:57.946 --> 15:58.306
That's right.

15:58.326 --> 15:59.027
What is she going to do?

15:59.047 --> 16:03.073
I mean, is she going to really admit that she's in a nosedive?

16:04.836 --> 16:05.978
Do you want some of this now?

16:06.238 --> 16:07.040
I'll wait on that.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.902
I'll have a roll, please.

16:08.922 --> 16:09.283
Yes, sir.

16:10.192 --> 16:11.553
And please take one for yourself.

16:11.573 --> 16:12.154
I shall.

16:13.455 --> 16:14.216
Coming your way.

16:14.256 --> 16:16.838
This is lovely.

16:16.898 --> 16:17.319
Thank you.

16:17.659 --> 16:18.039
Yes, it is.

16:18.059 --> 16:19.020
Thanks very much.

16:21.002 --> 16:24.665
But that's what I mean by Jim is the last.

16:25.606 --> 16:27.748
Because he got caught in a squeeze play.

16:28.449 --> 16:31.432
In the sense that he began a little later than I did, obviously.

16:31.492 --> 16:33.994
He suffered, as you read in the article I wrote.

16:34.334 --> 16:38.258
He was ignored by the establishment in terms of awards completely.

16:38.980 --> 16:44.885
just as Dr. Seuss was, because the books were funny and they weren't portentous.

16:45.445 --> 16:48.688
They didn't teach children anything.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.490
They weren't politically correct.

16:50.530 --> 16:52.872
They weren't all those things that give prizes.

16:53.913 --> 16:57.976
I'll always wonder why the Wild Things won the Coltican.

16:58.016 --> 17:05.362
I'm sure there was a rumor I was on my deathbed and I thought they should do it already before the guy croaked, because otherwise I can't figure that out.

17:07.704 --> 17:08.565
Do whatever you will.

17:09.473 --> 17:22.788
But then what happened to him was his unhappiness and disappointment of being ignored, the fact that he never got to sell terrifically well.

17:23.389 --> 17:32.259
What he didn't see, and what I didn't see, was that he was in the get-a-dem-a-rung of all of this, the collapsing of a system that had worked for 20, 30 years.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.742
It was now being shrunk and truncated.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.544
It wasn't time for a Jim Marshall.

17:36.845 --> 17:39.911
He was becoming a kind of eccentric in his own time.

17:40.633 --> 17:52.157
By the time he died, he was popular, but nowhere as popular as he should have been, nowhere as famous and beloved as he should have been.

17:53.019 --> 17:55.204
And could he be alive?

17:55.284 --> 17:56.727
I would explain it to him now.

17:57.112 --> 18:01.338
and that he would torture himself as to what was wrong and what wasn't he doing.

18:01.459 --> 18:02.220
It wasn't him.

18:02.260 --> 18:06.386
The industry was changing right in front of his eyes, but it was so close to us, we couldn't see it.

18:06.526 --> 18:10.372
But knowing what you know, would you advise him to do anything different?

18:10.392 --> 18:13.737
No, no more than I would advise myself, which is continue working.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.622
I'm continuing working, you know.

18:16.742 --> 18:19.885
It's like asking a literary writer to try and write a bestseller.

18:19.905 --> 18:20.685
How are you going to do this?

18:20.705 --> 18:21.526
Well, precisely.

18:21.586 --> 18:22.747
Nothing is going to change.

18:22.827 --> 18:43.285
Me now, the sad thing is I think kids coming in, young people coming in, as I did, have this mindset that they're going to have to do a book that will be very popular, make a lot of money, be able to be merchandised, and hopefully some movie company will be interested to make a film out of it.

18:44.986 --> 18:52.714
Now, that is the way to do a successful book now, as compared to me just having satisfied Ursula Nordstrom.

18:52.734 --> 18:54.716
There was nobody else to satisfy but this woman.

18:57.579 --> 19:03.886
So what do you think is persuading Houghton Mifflin to bring out a 25th anniversary volume of Jim's work?

19:05.328 --> 19:10.413
Well, it's wonderful, because now everybody who hasn't known George and Martha will know George and Martha.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.594
But I mean, what's persuading?

19:11.694 --> 19:13.356
It's certainly not the marketplace, is it?

19:14.450 --> 19:24.665
It's Anita Sylvie, who is a honorable forthright person who loves Jim Marshall's work, and she's a terrific editor and publisher, and she knows this is necessary.

19:24.725 --> 19:25.346
So she's doing it.

19:25.426 --> 19:26.567
She's doing the right thing.

19:28.610 --> 19:32.356
I mean, and also she's publishing something which, God willing, is going to be a tremendous seller.

19:32.656 --> 19:38.364
For people who love George and Martha, they've got an all-in-one volume, and for those who don't know it, they've got an all-in-one volume.

19:38.705 --> 19:40.407
So commercially, it makes sense.

19:40.427 --> 19:42.330
And it helps, of course, that you...

19:43.272 --> 19:44.253
Yes.

19:44.273 --> 19:46.335
Alive yourself with the project.

19:46.615 --> 19:47.056
Okay.

19:47.336 --> 19:49.458
I always feel uneasy about that.

19:50.359 --> 19:51.380
I can understand that.

19:51.400 --> 19:56.886
And I thought modesty makes me uneasy that I should be necessary to help Jim.

19:57.267 --> 19:58.107
I don't even like that.

19:58.788 --> 20:00.470
What I did it for was because I loved him.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.874
And I miss him terribly as a colleague and as a friend.

20:05.015 --> 20:12.182
And there are very, very, very few wonderful artists working in this profession.

20:12.449 --> 20:13.590
And it's a lonely profession.

20:13.730 --> 20:15.953
All art is a lonely profession, all commercial art.

20:15.973 --> 20:17.274
You don't talk to writers.

20:17.635 --> 20:22.460
The only conversations I have is with William Blake, John Keats, Wordsworth, and Shakespeare.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.281
And you know what?

20:23.421 --> 20:25.103
They don't talk back to me.

20:25.343 --> 20:27.566
And these are conversations that you have, of course.

20:27.626 --> 20:29.728
These are passionate conversations that I have.

20:30.108 --> 20:33.152
These are intense conversations.

20:33.172 --> 20:40.600
You asked me the question before which I averted because I didn't want to really talk about it because it sounds like...

20:41.204 --> 21:10.705
putting out too many personal things here but it was the death of my brother two years ago which was catastrophic to me because this was the best person in my life to whose memory by the way you dedicated the Rosenbach yes and Pierre and Pierre because Pierre was his favorite novel I have them both with me these are my two very favorite latest great thank you I brought them with me well he taught me to love Herman Melville he was five years my senior oh yeah oh he was a great the greatest influence in my life

21:11.495 --> 21:12.316
in every way.

21:12.717 --> 21:20.229
And when I illustrated Pierre, the irony of the situation is that he died just before the book was published.

21:21.090 --> 21:28.182
But the reading of Shakespeare came as a result of how to pull myself out of an emotional nosedive.

21:29.343 --> 21:38.498
And I did what everyone has always done, what Melville did when he was... I'm not comparing myself to him except in this one instance that when his depression set in,

21:38.933 --> 21:44.061
of the failure of Moby Dick and the failure of Pierre, he went to Shakespeare.

21:44.481 --> 21:47.306
It's like some people go to the Bible, some people go to Shakespeare.

21:47.787 --> 21:52.013
And Shakespeare was where I went like I scooted there.

21:52.714 --> 21:56.239
No more anxiety about was I smart enough to read Shakespeare.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.924
I knew this was my Bible.

22:00.125 --> 22:05.734
And so it was for the first year after my brother's death and then

22:06.085 --> 22:09.289
just little flickerings and senses and talking to people.

22:09.469 --> 22:13.574
And I have called people whom I don't know who are amazed.

22:13.594 --> 22:15.617
Am I calling scholars for Shakespeare?

22:15.657 --> 22:17.979
I was at Berkeley and I lectured and I met Stephen.

22:17.999 --> 22:18.680
I can help you on this.

22:19.061 --> 22:20.222
Oh, you've got to help me on this.

22:20.242 --> 22:21.303
Helen Bendler.

22:21.323 --> 22:21.664
Oh, Helen.

22:21.684 --> 22:23.026
I'm going to see someone in a couple of weeks.

22:23.406 --> 22:24.968
I give all time.

22:25.008 --> 22:25.228
Okay.

22:25.248 --> 22:26.470
We have so much to talk about.

22:26.650 --> 22:30.895
Shakespeare happens to be my, like don't even,

22:31.651 --> 22:33.394
We'll get into that another time.

22:33.614 --> 22:35.678
We'll have to do that another time.

22:36.018 --> 22:37.100
Shakespeare and Keats, of course.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.102
She's Keats as well.

22:38.442 --> 22:41.487
She has a brand new book coming out from Harvard.

22:41.507 --> 22:42.169
It's huge.

22:43.190 --> 22:48.179
She treats each of the 154 sonnets and major essays on each one.

22:48.499 --> 22:51.644
I called as soon as the proof came in.

22:51.664 --> 22:54.469
I said, you must set up an appointment with

22:54.955 --> 22:56.817
me, for me, with Helen Fennell.

22:57.178 --> 23:01.403
Nick, if I may call you Nick, we have got to work this out.

23:01.443 --> 23:04.446
This is a big project for the rest of my life.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.171
And also, it's making me happy after something that may be very, very sad.

23:08.912 --> 23:12.576
The Keats thing, I don't know what flicked me on to Keats.

23:12.796 --> 23:14.658
Well, he's the best poet who ever lived.

23:14.799 --> 23:16.761
Well, second to Shakespeare.

23:17.462 --> 23:20.465
I think for pure poetry, I have to go with Keats, maybe.

23:21.006 --> 23:24.490
Poetry and Menschkeit.

23:24.959 --> 23:30.184
This is one of the most humane persons I've ever known.

23:31.145 --> 23:31.645
Keats now.

23:31.685 --> 23:32.386
Keats, yeah.

23:33.187 --> 23:35.069
And so I just read, I know what it was.

23:35.509 --> 23:37.911
Somebody said you have to read the Bates biography.

23:38.972 --> 23:39.393
Of Keats?

23:39.553 --> 23:39.773
Yeah.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.694
Yeah, it's excellent.

23:40.714 --> 23:53.346
It's an excellent, it was the first introduction, but not only was it excellent about Keats, it was excellent about the whole English romantic poetry movement, so it got me involved with Wordsworth and Byron and blah, blah, blah.

23:53.663 --> 23:59.128
And mostly it set up the whole situation for me of reading Keats, because he quotes from the letters.

23:59.148 --> 24:00.369
The first thing I did was read the letters.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.351
I read all the letters.

24:02.411 --> 24:07.075
I got the volumes, the letters to George, the soul-making letters.

24:07.155 --> 24:13.561
And I'm thinking, how does this 22-year-old know everything and verbalize something I, in my late 60s, can't?

24:13.581 --> 24:14.722
I feel everything at such a young age.

24:14.822 --> 24:15.803
Yeah, and what is that?

24:16.924 --> 24:17.264
What is that?

24:17.284 --> 24:19.026
What is that kind of rare genius?

24:19.106 --> 24:19.506
You know what?

24:19.526 --> 24:20.347
He's Mozart.

24:20.367 --> 24:21.728
He's Schubert.

24:21.748 --> 24:21.848
Yeah.

24:21.912 --> 24:27.681
These are the very tiny cluster of perfection that has appeared on this earth.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.344
I love this person.

24:30.085 --> 24:35.053
Now I'm reading the poetry, and I'm doing the same thing with Keats that I've done with Shakespeare.

24:35.493 --> 24:41.663
Now I reached a point in Shakespeare where I found what I was looking for, but not consciously.

24:41.703 --> 24:43.786
I just knew I was there, so I had to stop for a while.

24:44.968 --> 24:47.953
And I then went to Keats, and now I'm reading Keats, and I'm waiting like,

24:48.237 --> 24:49.499
Like, what do you call that?

24:49.719 --> 24:50.601
A mine thing?

24:50.621 --> 24:52.884
When you're looking for... That's what I feel like.

24:52.924 --> 24:53.545
What is it called?

24:53.605 --> 24:54.526
I don't know what you're saying.

24:54.546 --> 24:55.047
What is it?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.531
It's not a mine sweeper.

24:57.551 --> 24:58.913
That's a ship.

24:58.933 --> 25:00.014
Well, you know what I mean.

25:00.275 --> 25:03.079
Like a guy who only looks for mines.

25:03.099 --> 25:05.923
That's what I think I look like when I'm reading Keats.

25:05.943 --> 25:09.689
I'm snuffling through everything, and when I find what I want, I'll stop.

25:10.330 --> 25:15.898
Are you... I hate to use the word interacting, but with Shakespeare and Keats...

25:16.773 --> 25:17.334
Verbally?

25:17.574 --> 25:21.077
See, I for one believe that Shakespeare totally thought in images.

25:21.638 --> 25:28.364
I mean, when you look at the imagery, the guy shoots you with an Uzi, I mean, with all different images that come at you.

25:28.384 --> 25:30.046
He had to think in images.

25:30.126 --> 25:33.128
I'll bet you think in imagery.

25:33.229 --> 25:33.529
I do.

25:34.129 --> 25:34.790
Of course I do.

25:35.531 --> 25:39.234
Everything I read, I see pictorially.

25:39.254 --> 25:40.095
That's what I do.

25:40.115 --> 25:43.298
I mean, in terms of actually think in terms of it.

25:43.318 --> 25:45.400
So I'm wondering now what you're getting out of Shakespeare.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.341
Are you getting images?

25:46.658 --> 25:48.340
Is it language coming for us?

25:48.360 --> 25:53.888
It's language engulfed by images, or images engulfed by language.

25:54.168 --> 25:59.475
One sweeping into the other or being eaten, engulfed is as good a word as any.

26:01.057 --> 26:16.277
The plays, I was reading in a very disorderly fashion when I met Stephen Greenblatt at Berkeley, who's the Shakespeare maven, who's a wonderful man, became friends, and he guided me a little bit

26:16.932 --> 26:27.204
and suggested, after my sort of maniacal, enthusiastic chatter, to read such and such plays, and I did.

26:27.224 --> 26:28.666
He recommended Pericles.

26:29.967 --> 26:32.290
So I went straight to Pericles.

26:33.151 --> 26:34.132
It's the best play.

26:34.693 --> 26:35.074
It's what?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.816
I don't think it's his best play.

26:36.916 --> 26:39.919
No, but what is going on in that play?

26:40.079 --> 26:40.760
I choked him.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.381
I'm sorry.

26:44.164 --> 26:46.006
It's like saying Titus Andronicus.

26:46.047 --> 26:46.467
Go ahead.

26:46.767 --> 26:53.515
Well, we know that, you know better than I, that not much of Pericles is Shakespeare.

26:54.436 --> 26:56.378
It wasn't even included in the first folio.

26:56.939 --> 27:15.340
But what has to be Shakespeare is the death of the wife, the so-called death of the daughter, and the resurrection of the wife and the daughter, because he gets into resurrections from Pericles to Cymbeline to Winter's Tale.

27:17.024 --> 27:18.625
which finishes with Tempest.

27:19.947 --> 27:20.867
Okay?

27:22.008 --> 27:22.869
I've been working hard.

27:24.270 --> 27:39.003
When I read Pericles, when he casts his wife on the ocean when she dies in childbirth to his daughter Marina, his wife is cast in the waters and the casket lands on the sand.

27:39.643 --> 27:42.306
Forgive me, Jim Marshall, I'll get right back to you.

27:43.247 --> 27:43.907
She should be dead.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.069
There was a magician living there

27:46.353 --> 27:49.178
And they open it and they spell the roses and essence of flower.

27:49.358 --> 27:49.939
This is Keats.

27:50.841 --> 27:53.866
And they open it and Marina is fresh and alive and beautiful.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.150
Shakespeare doesn't bother to explain.

27:56.451 --> 27:56.972
How come?

27:57.633 --> 27:58.855
He's not a religious man.

27:58.915 --> 28:00.798
This is art.

28:01.139 --> 28:02.101
This is not religion.

28:02.161 --> 28:05.507
And I got so close.

28:05.587 --> 28:06.969
My Geiger counter.

28:07.470 --> 28:08.091
Is that the word?

28:08.211 --> 28:10.255
Well, that's for uranium, but why not?

28:10.275 --> 28:10.976
All right, fuck it.

28:10.996 --> 28:11.517
Whatever it is.

28:13.505 --> 28:14.406
But it's good.

28:14.626 --> 28:15.627
But I like it.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.169
But I like Geiger Conner.

28:17.189 --> 28:18.551
I like it better than the other thing.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.373
I was getting closer.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.475
So then I went to Cymbeline.

28:23.316 --> 28:24.217
That drove me crazy.

28:25.058 --> 28:26.059
Because then we had the same thing.

28:26.119 --> 28:28.042
Somebody thinks somebody's dead.

28:28.062 --> 28:28.602
It's very dark.

28:28.622 --> 28:29.303
It's very dark.

28:29.323 --> 28:30.344
That's beautiful.

28:31.546 --> 28:38.574
The song that the brothers sing over what they think is the corpse of their new little brother, who's really a girl.

28:38.674 --> 28:39.715
I mean, it's Shakespeare.

28:40.015 --> 28:45.781
after Shakespeare, with sexes turned inside out, dead people who are living, living people who are dead.

28:47.342 --> 28:48.663
But what did it was The Winter's Tale.

28:50.365 --> 28:51.226
The Winter's Tale.

28:53.728 --> 28:54.409
That's where I stopped.

28:54.789 --> 29:00.374
I knew my Geiger counter told me, Moishe, here is the gold.

29:00.394 --> 29:01.496
Stop here for now.

29:01.516 --> 29:01.816
Really?

29:01.956 --> 29:02.176
Yeah.

29:02.837 --> 29:04.398
And I did stop there.

29:05.079 --> 29:07.221
I read The Tempest because they...

29:07.657 --> 29:15.468
It was always my favorite, but it was a wrong time for me to read it because The Winter's Tale threw me for such a loop.

29:15.508 --> 29:21.056
The temper seemed pale for the first time, so I put it aside to read it again, but I calmed down.

29:22.078 --> 29:22.939
Then I switched the keys.

29:24.581 --> 29:26.063
Are you searching for something?

29:26.103 --> 29:28.206
Of course, I'm going to write a book.

29:29.388 --> 29:34.255
I'm going to write a book, and it will have to do in some...

29:36.800 --> 29:41.424
essence way about my brother, but it won't be about my brother.

29:43.146 --> 29:52.234
But it'll be profoundly about something I'm scouring for, which I'm always scouring for every time I'm going to do a book, and it takes years to start a book, and I'll be very patient.

29:53.395 --> 29:54.956
If it doesn't get done, who cares?

29:55.737 --> 29:56.958
Can you see it?

29:56.978 --> 29:57.318
Vaguely.

29:57.919 --> 29:58.579
Very vaguely.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.441
Do you see pictures yet?

30:00.541 --> 30:00.761
Yep.

30:02.083 --> 30:02.843
I always see pictures.

30:02.863 --> 30:05.946
I try to ignore them because

30:06.365 --> 30:08.027
Otherwise, I'm seduced by pictures.

30:08.849 --> 30:09.770
So I banish them.

30:10.451 --> 30:11.593
My brain is like a Polaroid.

30:12.334 --> 30:13.636
Never stops making pictures.

30:13.696 --> 30:20.405
And I literally have to tear the film out of the goddamn machine so I can see language and just dwell on language.

30:20.425 --> 30:24.832
What's lovely about Keats, I don't want to draw pictures to Keats.

30:24.852 --> 30:26.234
I did watercolors to Shakespeare.

30:26.254 --> 30:26.955
I couldn't resist.

30:27.035 --> 30:28.637
And they're even being published.

30:28.657 --> 30:28.918
Really?

30:29.118 --> 30:29.659
By Cabin.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.783
When might I ask?

30:32.804 --> 30:35.207
Some have come out, but they're not very happy with it.

30:35.828 --> 31:05.768
be careful with this please I keep forgetting this yeah I will okay otherwise I'll be if you'll feel comfortable we'll go over quotes okay okay you know the point is I the pictures I did are so intensely erotic because when I read Shakespeare I was I couldn't believe how erotic he was how he's like drenched in sex so so am I so when I drew these pictures I did homage to Shakespeare you know

31:06.676 --> 31:08.239
Horny, horny images.

31:08.739 --> 31:10.222
They wanted.

31:10.322 --> 31:12.225
Are they doing it for kids?

31:12.906 --> 31:14.329
No, not for kids.

31:14.629 --> 31:18.075
These are cabin records of old Dick performances on CD.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.297
These are for grown-ups.

31:19.618 --> 31:20.399
So what's the problem?

31:20.820 --> 31:21.961
No problem.

31:21.981 --> 31:22.763
Not my problem.

31:22.903 --> 31:25.127
Not my problem.

31:25.147 --> 31:28.873
Well, look, if everybody made such a fuss in 1970 over Mickey's dick.

31:30.395 --> 31:31.738
No, we're talking about America, right?

31:31.778 --> 31:31.958
Yeah.

31:32.242 --> 31:34.425
which has a problem with such things as dicks.

31:34.565 --> 31:36.087
I mean, a lot of people don't know what a dick is.

31:36.167 --> 31:37.348
I think it's a cancerous growth.

31:37.628 --> 31:40.111
Apparently, a lot of people never saw it in 1970.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.816
I mean, who would have thought I would have opened their eyes to dicks?

31:44.857 --> 31:48.562
A strange, disorderly claim to fame, wouldn't you say?

31:49.162 --> 31:49.383
Right.

31:52.486 --> 31:57.152
So, they're being surprised that I would see Shakespeare in such an erotic light.

31:57.552 --> 31:57.973
Same thing.

31:57.993 --> 32:02.198
Isn't Shakespeare nice with women in long gowns and men in doublets and

32:02.819 --> 32:05.182
You don't expect them to be fucking or anything like that.

32:05.342 --> 32:06.022
That's all I do.

32:06.223 --> 32:08.946
Well, you got some flag for Pierre.

32:09.306 --> 32:11.649
I mean, God.

32:11.669 --> 32:12.269
Are you kidding?

32:12.329 --> 32:23.982
He said, as understatement, I mean, you talk about erotically charged illustrations, but that's what you saw, right?

32:24.002 --> 32:24.723
That's what I saw.

32:24.763 --> 32:26.365
That's what I always loved about the book.

32:27.266 --> 32:32.151
Because it was so hot because Melville is such a black comedian.

32:34.561 --> 32:37.985
We will... Let's go back to Jim.

32:38.306 --> 32:40.168
Well, I have plenty for Jim, by the way.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.031
Believe it or not, we talked about 15 minutes.

32:42.091 --> 32:42.671
Good, all right.

32:42.691 --> 32:43.412
That's a lot of time.

32:43.432 --> 32:44.594
That's a lot of quotes.

32:44.614 --> 32:51.302
And I will write about... But I don't want to sound negative about putting the whole business down and Jim being caught in a trap.

32:51.363 --> 32:52.083
Trust me on this.

32:52.103 --> 32:52.364
All right.

32:53.405 --> 32:54.046
I can say that.

32:54.066 --> 32:55.027
I don't have to quote you on it.

32:55.047 --> 32:55.227
Right.

32:55.468 --> 32:59.573
Because otherwise, if anybody knows I'm a curmudgeon and I sound like curmudgeon,

33:00.194 --> 33:05.058
The fact is, I'm not a curmudgeon, but now that I'm getting old, the old Susan, a curmudgeon.

33:05.379 --> 33:06.780
I'll put it in a positive sense.

33:07.020 --> 33:10.343
I mean, you say that you believe him to be the last in the line.

33:10.363 --> 33:10.543
Right.

33:10.563 --> 33:11.344
And we'll say that.

33:11.524 --> 33:18.730
I'm not going to put you into a dialogue with people on all this other shit of a golden age and stuff like that.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.031
The golden age.

33:20.051 --> 33:21.593
I mean, I was amazed.

33:21.613 --> 33:28.999
This is, you know, it's just not relevant to what... The golden age always makes me think of somebody who's so old they can't control their bladder anymore.

33:29.019 --> 33:30.100
That's the golden age.

33:31.953 --> 33:33.135
That's very, very good.

33:34.016 --> 33:37.421
You know, I've gone through everything, I have to tell you.

33:39.284 --> 33:45.193
You really, you're a writer, as much as you are an artist.

33:45.213 --> 33:46.094
Oh, yeah.

33:46.114 --> 33:46.194
Yep.

33:46.214 --> 33:48.658
I mean, it's not often assumed about me, but I know it's true.

33:48.678 --> 33:53.945
Well, I mean, I reread yesterday, I mean, from page one to the end, you know, Caldecai and Company.

33:53.965 --> 33:54.827
It's the writing there.

33:54.847 --> 34:00.475
If you want to look at a sweep, you know, a take on

34:01.332 --> 34:03.836
a certain take on book illustration.

34:04.998 --> 34:06.119
It's in that book.

34:06.139 --> 34:06.480
I agree.

34:07.061 --> 34:13.971
And the writing, even though there are little years and dates after them, and I'm sure, and I've read many of these from the New York Times or Book World or wherever.

34:14.712 --> 34:17.376
Actually, a paper called the Herald Tribune.

34:17.536 --> 34:20.040
A wonderful paper called the Herald Tribune.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.242
Book World for the Herald Tribune.

34:23.345 --> 34:26.370
These are, as you say of Jim's work, they're not dated.

34:27.491 --> 34:28.273
His work is not dated.

34:28.293 --> 34:29.514
These essays are not dated.

34:29.534 --> 34:29.955
Thank you.

34:30.205 --> 34:35.053
And I wrote your acceptance remarks.

34:35.133 --> 34:40.421
These things are written to go beyond the moment, I think.

34:40.862 --> 34:41.203
Thank you.

34:41.223 --> 34:41.783
So you're a writer.

34:41.904 --> 34:43.807
Yeah, but that's why I don't write them anymore.

34:43.867 --> 34:50.217
I mean, the only reason I ever did the Marshall piece for Anita was because it was Jim.

34:50.237 --> 34:52.260
I don't intend to write anymore except for myself.

34:53.001 --> 34:54.183
Because you know this, too.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.208
You're going to write serious essays and articles

34:57.948 --> 34:59.190
Hey, that's hard.

34:59.551 --> 35:00.132
Takes weeks.

35:00.612 --> 35:02.195
Rewriting, editing, rewriting.

35:02.556 --> 35:03.517
Did you really mean this?

35:03.537 --> 35:04.459
Did you really mean this?

35:04.539 --> 35:05.080
Write it again.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.622
It came to me.

35:06.663 --> 35:07.504
Why am I doing this?

35:07.524 --> 35:09.147
Do it for yourself.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.549
You know, it's a Shakespearean key.

35:10.589 --> 35:12.452
The book is brewing in you.

35:14.195 --> 35:14.596
No more writing.

35:15.217 --> 35:16.299
No more writing except for me.

35:16.860 --> 35:18.122
I'm never going to do this again.

35:18.182 --> 35:20.125
It's too hard to do it.

35:20.898 --> 35:22.359
I'm sorry, go ahead.

35:22.379 --> 35:23.661
No, that's it.

35:23.681 --> 35:24.081
I did it.

35:24.101 --> 35:25.302
I came out only for Jim.

35:25.543 --> 35:26.443
That's the only reason.

35:26.504 --> 35:44.261
Well, when you go to Shakespeare and the Keats and we're talking about a book, we're talking about, for instance, your best-known book, Where the Wild Things Are, one of your three or four, you know, one of your certainly, one of your great books, books that's certainly one of the books that's identified you in many ways.

35:44.281 --> 35:45.062
Almost entirely.

35:45.562 --> 35:46.303
It's 385 words, right?

35:46.623 --> 35:47.504
That's right.

35:48.145 --> 35:49.386
Very condensed poetry.

35:50.024 --> 35:54.990
Do you think that this book that you're going to Shakespeare and the Keats for, that would be the extent of the text, right?

35:55.010 --> 35:55.090
Yes.

35:56.352 --> 36:00.757
And we probably, we would have to know that there are echoes of Shakespeare in there, like Keats.

36:00.777 --> 36:01.418
I don't even care.

36:02.099 --> 36:05.864
Maybe somebody like you with your reading and intuition will know that.

36:06.885 --> 36:08.787
Maybe somebody, most people won't.

36:10.229 --> 36:12.512
I read Keats poetry and I do what everybody does.

36:12.532 --> 36:13.914
I underline and make little statements.

36:14.354 --> 36:16.477
Take this, take this, take this.

36:17.838 --> 36:19.120
I'm taking from a kid.

36:19.673 --> 36:24.678
I'm 45 years older than this kid, and he's saying something better than I ever thought of.

36:25.519 --> 36:33.987
I have to tell you, a couple years ago on my birthday, it was two years ago, precisely, my editor at home called, and I was in a pissy mood, and he says, Nick, what's the matter?

36:34.007 --> 36:36.389
Your book's coming out in two months, and it's wonderful.

36:36.449 --> 36:39.912
I said, Alan, do you realize I'm 52 years old today?

36:39.952 --> 36:41.234
Today.

36:41.914 --> 36:43.075
He said, well, happy birthday.

36:43.095 --> 36:45.698
I said, you know who died on his 52nd birthday?

36:46.319 --> 36:46.839
Shakespeare.

36:46.959 --> 36:48.921
He died on his 52nd birthday.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.722
I said, and my first book hasn't even come out yet?

36:52.563 --> 36:57.288
Hopefully he had accomplished, you know, by the time... You have a lot of company.

36:57.308 --> 36:57.968
No, no, no.

36:57.988 --> 36:58.809
I'm not comparing myself.

36:58.849 --> 36:59.470
I know you're not.

36:59.490 --> 37:06.336
It doesn't make you stop and think about... I think Keats died... 29, wasn't he?

37:06.356 --> 37:06.997
26?

37:07.017 --> 37:08.378
No, he wasn't even 26.

37:08.418 --> 37:09.399
He was approaching 26.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.323
Look how many more years I've been given than he was given.

37:14.184 --> 37:17.507
What is obvious that I think that

37:17.909 --> 37:29.267
What he would have done with these years that I couldn't do because I'm not endowed, the unfairness of that situation, so did Beethoven die at 52 or 54 or something like that.

37:30.108 --> 37:34.055
It's so unreasonable that Keats was plowed down.

37:34.776 --> 37:39.103
In his case, we talked about Stephen Crane, who died at 29.

37:39.483 --> 37:40.325
He was burned out.

37:40.866 --> 37:41.767
He had nothing left.

37:42.268 --> 37:43.530
He used himself up.

37:44.551 --> 37:45.553
Keats was just...

37:45.668 --> 37:46.910
He hadn't even reached it yet.

37:46.930 --> 37:47.450
That's right.

37:47.731 --> 37:49.012
He hadn't even reached it yet.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.254
He was just reaching it.

37:50.274 --> 37:53.659
He was just getting there, and... It was stolen from him.

37:53.979 --> 38:00.007
So any comfort we may take from the gods are watching us because we're artists and we're worth protecting is total bullshit.

38:00.588 --> 38:01.890
Nobody's watching anybody.

38:02.451 --> 38:03.892
And if you make it, you're lucky.

38:05.354 --> 38:05.955
I'm serious.

38:06.075 --> 38:12.224
If I... I was so late in coming to who I am as an artist, and I'm such a sickly person.

38:12.284 --> 38:14.747
I was sickly as a child, sickly as an adolescent...

38:14.913 --> 38:16.155
heart attack when I was 37.

38:17.456 --> 38:19.959
You know, I never expected I would live to this age.

38:21.241 --> 38:21.942
I just didn't.

38:21.982 --> 38:23.524
I'll be 70 next year.

38:24.485 --> 38:25.226
When's your birthday?

38:25.466 --> 38:25.846
In June.

38:27.609 --> 38:32.695
So, to me, being 70 is glorious.

38:34.117 --> 38:34.858
I didn't count on it.

38:34.998 --> 38:37.241
And I'm not there yet, so maybe I won't even get to 70.

38:37.401 --> 38:42.507
Do you have a sense of where you are in this tradition that you come out of?

38:43.718 --> 38:44.619
No.

38:44.699 --> 39:08.180
I think I'm of obviously an older generation who adheres and believes in these great prophets like Mozart, Schubert, Keyes, etc., who totally believes they're alive and that my entire life's work, spirit, intellectual, in every other way, depends on my connection to them.

39:08.641 --> 39:11.363
This whole new education in colleges where

39:11.917 --> 39:14.580
You don't read Herman Melville because he treated women badly.

39:15.301 --> 39:17.764
You don't read so-and-so because they treated kids badly.

39:18.504 --> 39:19.826
It's so dumb.

39:21.268 --> 39:22.089
It's so mindless.

39:23.670 --> 39:27.475
Politically correct is like the death of a lot of art.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.297
It's like white European males.

39:29.477 --> 39:30.458
I know.

39:31.059 --> 39:32.160
And Herman is one of them.

39:32.260 --> 39:33.281
Herman is one of them.

39:33.561 --> 39:37.486
Screw Herman because he kicked his wife down the stairs.

39:37.546 --> 39:38.447
We don't know that.

39:39.102 --> 39:39.743
He may have.

39:40.004 --> 39:41.847
He may have kicked her twice down the stairs.

39:42.868 --> 39:45.573
I'm sorry for Lizzie, but it doesn't change anything.

39:45.593 --> 39:46.875
You know, what did Faulkner say?

39:47.356 --> 39:49.399
One good novel is worth ten grandmothers?

39:49.419 --> 39:52.324
I mean, I don't know what to call it.

39:52.384 --> 39:52.905
Make it 15.

39:52.925 --> 39:54.408
I don't know what to call it.

39:54.748 --> 39:57.994
Rather crude, nonetheless.

39:59.296 --> 40:03.523
But Scott Turow told me he's on the board of trustees at Amherst College.

40:04.297 --> 40:17.712
And that he had heard, he was at the table with a president of Amherst College who was informed, this was about two years ago, that they had just graduated summa cum laude, an English major who had never taken a course in Shakespeare.

40:18.352 --> 40:20.795
And the president, he said, we did that?

40:21.015 --> 40:22.257
Did we really do that?

40:22.477 --> 40:23.238
We allowed that?

40:23.999 --> 40:26.922
And, you know, I did an interview with Harold Bloom last summer.

40:26.942 --> 40:27.422
Oh, wow.

40:27.442 --> 40:28.644
He's going to be in this book.

40:28.664 --> 40:29.064
Oh, wow.

40:29.645 --> 40:32.548
And we talk about, because I want to have a chapter on the canon.

40:32.866 --> 40:33.447
by the way.

40:33.747 --> 40:36.651
He made me.

40:37.753 --> 40:39.716
Someone asked him about the children's book canon.

40:39.736 --> 40:40.917
It was me and Salinger.

40:42.820 --> 40:43.581
In fact, I read it.

40:43.601 --> 40:46.345
I found it on the internet, by the way, preparing for this interview.

40:46.946 --> 40:47.987
Did you see it, by the way?

40:48.027 --> 40:49.249
No.

40:49.309 --> 40:51.112
I only heard about it.

40:51.452 --> 40:54.316
I'll be happy to send you a comment if you like.

40:54.336 --> 40:55.858
I should have brought it with me.

40:57.020 --> 40:57.881
I was so proud.

40:57.921 --> 41:02.788
The junior canon, Western canon, they asked you to

41:03.663 --> 41:05.405
In fact, I'm not going to ask you questions.

41:05.425 --> 41:10.592
I'm going to try to stay away from questions that you've answered eloquently elsewhere, if that's okay with you.

41:11.093 --> 41:11.293
Please.

41:11.354 --> 41:16.521
I mean, I would like to talk about how music, you say, energizes everything that you do.

41:16.561 --> 41:23.530
I'd like a fresh quote on that, but you seem to have spoken to that question half a dozen times elsewhere.

41:24.251 --> 41:27.255
Unless your thought has changed on that.

41:28.317 --> 41:29.879
No, let me think.

41:30.780 --> 41:32.202
But you certainly are working more...

41:32.485 --> 41:33.606
heavily with music.

41:34.487 --> 41:35.388
Always with music.

41:35.408 --> 41:41.815
I make strange partners in my own imagination.

41:42.516 --> 41:47.621
To me, I don't know why I like Keats.

41:48.042 --> 41:51.265
I've decided he was Mozart.

41:52.086 --> 41:59.334
Now, since I've been listening mostly to Schubert because of the Richter thing, Keats is more Schubert.

41:59.374 --> 42:00.315
There is

42:00.751 --> 42:06.680
It's a completely, this is not, we shouldn't even go here, because it's a mindless little game I play in my own thing.

42:08.442 --> 42:14.832
Well, we talked about, I think that's wonderful that you told me about the Shakespeare and the Keats stuff, because that's new.

42:14.852 --> 42:16.013
That is brand new, yep.

42:16.394 --> 42:20.580
That's new in my life, and it has invigorated my life.

42:21.482 --> 42:28.071
I mean, I would say The Winter's Tale, it sounds facetious, has made me a happy man.

42:29.193 --> 42:29.273
Hmm.

42:29.607 --> 42:37.438
There are secrets in that play that will more than feed me for the rest of my life.

42:37.599 --> 42:37.959
Really?

42:38.119 --> 42:39.321
Oh, yeah.

42:39.361 --> 42:41.124
Can you give me any specifics?

42:41.424 --> 42:41.624
No.

42:42.526 --> 42:42.986
I can't.

42:45.089 --> 42:45.570
I don't know.

42:45.670 --> 42:47.934
But is it something that resonates with your own life?

42:47.994 --> 42:48.855
Oh, well, of course.

42:48.975 --> 42:50.157
It has to resonate.

42:50.397 --> 42:51.559
That's the Geiger count.

42:51.579 --> 42:54.503
If it didn't resonate with my own life, I wouldn't feel this intensely.

42:55.505 --> 42:57.167
Art teaches us about ourselves.

42:57.704 --> 43:02.010
You know, you sniff around and you find out what you're feeling, what your idea is.

43:02.731 --> 43:04.954
That's what great art always has done.

43:05.014 --> 43:06.516
That's why Shakespeare is Shakespeare.

43:06.576 --> 43:07.458
He does that for you.

43:08.199 --> 43:10.242
Ibsen does it for you on occasion.

43:11.163 --> 43:20.075
But I have to say, in going through everything that I could find on Maurice Sendak, is that, you know, and you've spoken to this, and I've pulled them together.

43:20.095 --> 43:23.600
You know, we have echoes of Blake and Pierre.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.603
We have echoes of Melville elsewhere.

43:25.643 --> 43:26.344
We have echoes of

43:26.662 --> 43:29.566
Dickens and the Brothers Grimm yet again.

43:30.247 --> 43:34.733
You went and you immersed yourself for a week in Hans Christian Andersen.

43:34.954 --> 43:37.938
You went to see Thomas Buick's study.

43:38.779 --> 43:41.843
I had a heart attack there.

43:42.084 --> 43:42.504
Is that right?

43:43.606 --> 43:46.189
Sure, but it wasn't Thomas Buick that got me that excited.

43:46.270 --> 43:49.154
It was just a bad heart.

43:49.174 --> 43:50.155
It was a bad heart.

43:50.557 --> 43:52.879
I mean, the kinds of things that you've done.

43:52.959 --> 44:01.847
I mean, does the touching of objects, be they artifacts or be they text, is there something ineffable there, something that... I'm a collector.

44:02.948 --> 44:04.130
I have to have first editions.

44:05.791 --> 44:13.058
I can open up The Whale, first English edition of Moby Dick, six months before it became Moby Dick, even, in America.

44:13.939 --> 44:18.623
And I can smell a copy that wasn't...

44:18.822 --> 44:19.803
Hermann's possession.

44:20.043 --> 44:23.888
This literally was in Hermann's possession because he gave it to his brother, Alan.

44:24.088 --> 44:25.069
His name is in the book.

44:25.089 --> 44:25.870
And you have that one?

44:25.890 --> 44:26.511
I have that one.

44:27.492 --> 44:33.138
So every time I open it, it's Proust, who I love, adore.

44:34.259 --> 44:35.240
Because everything is Proust.

44:35.481 --> 44:37.483
Everything is Proust, ultimately.

44:37.983 --> 44:48.475
Open up our first edition and the essence comes out and I'm an arrowhead and there's Hermann and there's Alan and there's Augusta and there's Maria and there's a ganzer familia and

44:50.750 --> 44:51.631
That's what books are.

44:51.992 --> 44:54.635
Stephen Gould says this for my new book, by the way.

44:54.895 --> 44:58.360
He has to, you know, of course, he's the scientist, the art fiction writer.

44:58.540 --> 45:00.022
You are the artist.

45:00.042 --> 45:02.185
I've got Humberto Eco as the fiction writer.

45:02.205 --> 45:04.988
These are people I've interviewed for this book.

45:05.789 --> 45:11.797
How does the text, how does handling the real thing... Here's Gould writing about science.

45:12.278 --> 45:14.200
He said, I can't do it with facsimiles.

45:14.761 --> 45:16.944
Something magical happens.

45:16.964 --> 45:17.044
Yes.

45:17.378 --> 45:18.840
And don't ask me to describe it.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.102
Well, because he's right.

45:20.302 --> 45:23.266
But the thing is, well, we don't even have to describe it.

45:23.567 --> 45:26.230
We're animals, and we have animal natures.

45:26.431 --> 45:28.193
And there is something... Yeah, I would.

45:28.433 --> 45:29.775
Please have some for yourself.

45:31.658 --> 45:35.724
I think it has a sensual component to it.

45:36.384 --> 45:43.234
It must... It must... I can't explain it any more than he can...

45:44.328 --> 45:46.611
Now, you also have manuscripts, I understand.

45:46.631 --> 45:48.313
I have letters.

45:48.534 --> 45:50.757
You have letters, which I've seen in the Rosenbach.

45:50.777 --> 45:55.924
I'm a little anxious about talking about project collections only because there are maniacs all over the world.

45:55.964 --> 45:57.426
So I have to be really careful.

45:57.646 --> 46:00.791
And, by the way, I never say where people live, by the way.

46:00.811 --> 46:01.451
Please.

46:01.471 --> 46:05.537
And even... And you'll see in here, we work it out.

46:05.797 --> 46:06.458
Okay.

46:06.618 --> 46:09.222
Because I live alone here, and I have a lot of...

46:09.421 --> 46:32.003
stuff here i'm not but this is not a book about collecting i know i know but i have to say that compulsively because i worry ultimately we'll talk about things i mean i'm not going to say i'm not going to mention sir but i'm not going to get into that he has a you know a manuscript of uh pierre or letters talking about this you know the things that were in the rosenbach that's you know i'll cite

46:34.801 --> 46:37.805
have a scholarly bent, we'll go to that.

46:37.825 --> 46:49.903
Something I have that I want you to see, but I don't want it recorded at all, but I think you will appreciate it, but I got it anonymously under a pseudonym, is a death mask of Keats.

46:51.405 --> 47:03.643
This was made 24 hours after his death by Severin, who the young artist, I can't remember his first name, who was with him in Rome, who was terrified.

47:04.012 --> 47:06.034
taking care of two young men.

47:06.795 --> 47:13.602
And Severin is trying to get a reputation of painting pictures of Italian landscapes and trying to take care of this dying young man.

47:13.642 --> 47:25.595
And he is the one who wrote Holm and described the terrible last months of Keats, the physical agony that he was suffering.

47:26.476 --> 47:32.382
And it's his last letter Holm describing the moment where he said,

47:33.678 --> 47:37.322
He called him over to him and said, 7-7, and he went to Keats.

47:38.383 --> 47:41.005
And at this point, Keats knew he was hopeless.

47:41.025 --> 47:41.886
He fought to the end.

47:41.966 --> 47:43.428
He desperately didn't want to die.

47:43.928 --> 47:45.210
He was furious.

47:45.410 --> 47:52.337
The letters to Fanny Braun, his fiancée, are full of rage that he can't have her, that she's having a life.

47:52.397 --> 47:53.758
It's terrible.

47:53.778 --> 47:55.180
There was no philosophy left.

47:55.800 --> 47:59.064
So, well, I can't use it, so it's too bad I can't do.

48:00.245 --> 48:02.487
Harvard, of course, has a life mask of Keats.

48:03.091 --> 48:08.936
I have a life mask, but it's a commercial one, and it's probably not as good as what they have.

48:09.757 --> 48:13.621
They may have, the death mask is very hard.

48:15.002 --> 48:21.007
One was made, as I said, 24 hours after his death, mostly of his hand and of his foot.

48:21.428 --> 48:22.889
The hand and the foot have disappeared.

48:24.571 --> 48:29.355
Sever made the mask because he wanted to do a portrait of Keats later, which he did.

48:29.395 --> 48:31.377
Unfortunately, he was not a very good painter.

48:32.318 --> 48:33.620
and the portrait isn't very good.

48:34.622 --> 48:36.765
He had the matrix for the mask.

48:37.546 --> 48:41.873
His wife was so disgusted by it that she had it destroyed.

48:41.913 --> 48:44.677
There were any number of them, but they're all gone now.

48:45.478 --> 48:51.708
The one I have is the best one I've ever seen from photographs because it is intact.

48:51.768 --> 48:52.930
It is not mutilated.

48:53.030 --> 48:55.334
Usually they're scratched, worked over, repaired.

48:55.354 --> 48:58.098
This is a real thing.

48:58.238 --> 48:59.440
And it came from his...

49:00.230 --> 49:00.831
Remains.

49:01.151 --> 49:01.992
Came from his remains.

49:02.132 --> 49:06.698
While the body perhaps was... When you look at it, I have the life mask in one room, the death mask in another.

49:06.758 --> 49:08.160
It's only like two years.

49:08.180 --> 49:12.526
The life mask is that fleshed face of a 22-year-old.

49:13.327 --> 49:14.909
You can almost see the color of the cheeks.

49:15.750 --> 49:18.413
Healthy, vigorous, English face.

49:18.974 --> 49:20.076
Half smiling.

49:20.096 --> 49:23.180
And the death mask is... The flesh is melted away.

49:23.200 --> 49:27.746
24 hours already, the face is caving in.

49:27.766 --> 49:28.887
But it's so incredible.

49:29.069 --> 49:31.131
Because this mass covered that brain, too.

49:31.151 --> 49:31.952
That's right.

49:32.092 --> 49:33.193
Covered that forehead.

49:33.353 --> 49:35.154
Covered those eyes that observed.

49:35.375 --> 49:39.879
And does this, you know, this has to go through.

49:39.899 --> 49:44.963
It has to be some... I am a living sieve.

49:44.983 --> 49:46.224
Everything is going through.

49:46.545 --> 49:54.072
And the Rosenbach catalog, a fellow who wrote the introduction, says you slept in Phil Rosenbach's bed, I guess.

49:54.412 --> 49:56.574
Dr. Rosenbach's bare rug.

49:57.014 --> 49:57.575
Is that right?

49:57.675 --> 49:59.076
A rug thrown over his bed.

49:59.495 --> 50:00.556
Rosenbach would faint.

50:00.797 --> 50:11.190
They know what went on in those days where I said, can I have the Songs of Innocence and Experience, and can I have... You want real coffee put up?

50:11.210 --> 50:12.632
You can have some?

50:12.652 --> 50:12.712
No.

50:12.732 --> 50:13.152
You sure?

50:13.853 --> 50:14.494
Put it up.

50:14.554 --> 50:15.395
No, no thanks.

50:15.415 --> 50:18.479
I had plenty this morning.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.322
Just put some water up.

50:20.502 --> 50:21.223
I'll take care of it.

50:21.403 --> 50:22.204
Okay.

50:22.965 --> 50:28.192
I'll just be around here calling me when you're ready.

50:28.212 --> 50:28.472
Um...

50:28.942 --> 50:49.109
You notice I haven't said, and I don't really wish to pursue it to any great degree, and maybe only tangentially if I can, but you always find a subtext in your reading that involves children.

50:49.750 --> 50:50.110
Yeah.

50:50.591 --> 50:53.515
And, you know, I mean, I, for one, you know,

50:53.883 --> 50:56.146
I think it's insulting to say these are children's books.

50:56.466 --> 50:57.647
Well, I do too.

50:57.747 --> 51:07.879
In fact, I have started, and I'm now, from my syndication, I'm doing a monthly children's book column just about children's books of what I'm defined as.

51:08.019 --> 51:15.467
But I am treating them as books to be reviewed on their merits, on their terms, as writing.

51:15.487 --> 51:16.989
That would be historical breakthrough.

51:17.109 --> 51:22.455
And I've already got major newspapers that are picking it up because there's nothing else quite like it.

51:22.739 --> 51:24.541
And I'm bringing everything I have to bear.

51:24.561 --> 51:26.163
Do you realize that it is a breakthrough?

51:26.183 --> 51:29.247
That when I fought for years, I don't fight for more.

51:29.327 --> 51:30.569
I'll send you a couple.

51:30.589 --> 51:31.710
I've done six now.

51:31.870 --> 51:33.312
I do eight books a month each one.

51:33.332 --> 51:35.034
I give each one like 200 words.

51:35.054 --> 51:36.076
That's a lot of words.

51:36.977 --> 51:46.048
For a book that's only 32 pages long in some instances, I go into the writing, I go into the story, the originality of the story, the artwork, what the artwork's trying to do.

51:46.488 --> 51:50.974
If it's politically correct, basically I'm not interested in it, unless...

51:51.663 --> 51:57.068
I mean, if this is trying to make a politically correct statement, that's not interesting to me anymore.

51:57.088 --> 51:58.169
Well, to kids or to anybody.

51:59.531 --> 52:11.362
Children are offended by that, to be treated as receptacles for pure morality tales, and for how to be a good little boy or a good little girl.

52:11.723 --> 52:15.686
It doesn't work anyway, because they're all turning out to be bad little boys and bad little girls.

52:15.787 --> 52:19.290
Did you see the article in the New York Times, which I thought was like

52:20.452 --> 52:28.199
A Magna Carta of degeneracy is about two weeks ago why children's movies don't make it.

52:28.239 --> 52:38.448
And it's because Hercules and a few other children's movies that came out had not been that successful financially.

52:39.349 --> 52:49.598
And the people at Disney and the other people involved whose movies had not been successful said, I guess there's no such thing as a children's movie because we made our attempt

52:49.831 --> 52:51.454
Children aren't what they used to be.

52:51.995 --> 52:53.097
Children are barbaric.

52:53.939 --> 52:54.921
Boys are degenerates.

52:54.941 --> 52:55.482
They come in.

52:55.522 --> 52:56.123
They're monsters.

52:56.163 --> 52:57.145
They want to see killing.

52:57.165 --> 52:57.786
They want to see this.

52:58.327 --> 53:00.110
Who has made them this way?

53:00.171 --> 53:05.921
They've been looking at shitty, corrupt movies and television for so long, and now it's a kids' forum.

53:06.322 --> 53:11.552
So these studios have to conform to the new degenerate needs of American children.

53:11.853 --> 53:14.177
I could not believe this.

53:14.257 --> 53:15.038
I'll do a search.

53:15.058 --> 53:16.661
There's no irony in the situation.

53:17.362 --> 53:18.404
None whatsoever.

53:18.704 --> 53:19.786
Totally.

53:19.806 --> 53:22.230
They didn't make the money.

53:23.171 --> 53:27.138
Okay, let's have more dinosaur movies where little girls are eating up for lunch or brunch.

53:27.799 --> 53:28.781
Especially little girls.

53:28.801 --> 53:31.064
The whole thing would have girls are of no use.

53:31.084 --> 53:33.388
If a girl's in the movie, forget it.

53:33.408 --> 53:37.074
No money, because no little boy is going to go see a little girl in a movie.

53:37.094 --> 53:38.316
They actually said that.

53:39.595 --> 53:42.858
setting up the kids for just what they wanted to do.

53:44.160 --> 53:52.649
And I thought, the irony of the situation, I've been saying for 30 or more years, there's no such thing as a children's book, there's no such thing as a children's movie.

53:53.009 --> 53:53.870
Now they're saying it.

53:54.251 --> 53:58.495
But look at the reasons why they're saying it, and look at the reasons why I said it.

53:59.136 --> 54:01.779
And it's depressing.

54:02.499 --> 54:04.962
But your point is, a point is,

54:05.988 --> 54:09.733
You refuse to insult the intelligence of the reader.

54:10.655 --> 54:12.918
They say, well, your books are scary.

54:14.801 --> 54:16.703
Maybe it's too scary for some kids.

54:17.765 --> 54:32.586
And you respond by saying, you love the instance when a child is free to make any choice that he wants to make, she wants to make, and to see the consequences of that.

54:32.836 --> 54:35.840
You know, rub two sticks together and see what kind of sparks fly.

54:35.920 --> 54:38.584
I guess maybe it's kind of like... Exactly, and let them go.

54:39.405 --> 54:43.111
I can't tell you how many... I got a degree at Yale.

54:44.593 --> 54:45.594
A lot of kids came over.

54:47.056 --> 54:48.859
Wow, first saw your book.

54:49.039 --> 54:50.221
I was really scared.

54:50.661 --> 54:51.603
And I really love it.

54:51.623 --> 54:55.228
And you see the time that it takes to get involved into a work of art.

54:56.029 --> 54:56.770
Okay, that's great.

54:58.973 --> 55:00.075
I'm sorry, go ahead.

55:00.095 --> 55:00.215
No.

55:00.235 --> 55:00.295
No.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.744
Your father used to read to you, I guess, scary things?

55:05.285 --> 55:06.007
He never read.

55:06.047 --> 55:06.748
He made them up.

55:07.389 --> 55:08.130
They were petrified.

55:09.012 --> 55:10.034
These were all invented stories.

55:10.074 --> 55:11.176
These were all invented stories.

55:11.396 --> 55:12.899
He couldn't read English.

55:13.139 --> 55:14.983
They got that wrong on the net.

55:15.183 --> 55:16.966
No, they got a lot of things wrong on the net.

55:17.527 --> 55:18.729
In fact, the net is wrong.

55:20.132 --> 55:21.895
You should talk about that.

55:22.516 --> 55:25.178
Just today's paper, there's Kurt Vonnegut.

55:25.279 --> 55:25.659
I love it.

55:25.699 --> 55:26.520
I clipped it already.

55:26.540 --> 55:27.661
It's already in my file.

55:27.741 --> 55:28.502
It's hilarious.

55:28.602 --> 55:30.243
It's exactly what's going to happen.

55:30.383 --> 55:30.724
I have.

55:30.904 --> 55:33.246
I'm going to do a chapter on books.

55:33.266 --> 55:34.187
Books of the future.

55:35.348 --> 55:36.869
And, you know, the consequences.

55:37.190 --> 55:39.832
The fact that you can go in and fuck around with these things.

55:39.872 --> 55:40.413
Completely.

55:40.493 --> 55:41.394
Anything you like.

55:41.634 --> 55:43.456
And attribute it to somebody, you know.

55:43.696 --> 55:46.498
I'm getting tons of boxes saying, please autograph these books.

55:47.579 --> 55:48.821
What the fuck are these coming from?

55:49.341 --> 55:50.022
You track it down.

55:50.142 --> 55:51.443
On the internet, there's somebody.

55:51.693 --> 55:58.744
who, for a dollar, will send you the personal phone number and address of any artist you like that you want to have autographed.

55:58.764 --> 55:59.525
I have no control.

55:59.545 --> 56:00.767
I can't stop this man.

56:01.468 --> 56:05.233
Somebody, we read wild things on the Internet, the whole text.

56:06.295 --> 56:06.675
Really?

56:06.715 --> 56:11.763
I just obliterated from my consciousness.

56:11.783 --> 56:17.271
But even more threatening, of course, is the fact that people can vote.

56:17.311 --> 56:18.493
There's no guarantee...

56:19.604 --> 56:22.808
that the integrity of something that somebody... That's whatsoever.

56:23.069 --> 56:28.797
His Vonnegut... His own wife... Comments are being attributed to him that he didn't make.

56:28.857 --> 56:29.157
That's right.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.639
And there's nothing he can do to stop it.

56:30.659 --> 56:30.860
Nothing.

56:30.980 --> 56:32.242
It's all over the world.

56:33.083 --> 56:35.606
And really, it's going to take... It's a small thing.

56:36.047 --> 56:37.930
But it could be something very significant.

56:37.970 --> 56:39.051
It's a cute little remark.

56:39.332 --> 56:40.253
But let's say it wasn't.

56:40.513 --> 56:41.615
Let's say it was a slander.

56:41.795 --> 56:47.583
What if I hurt somebody or destroy somebody's life or career or throw somebody to suicide?

56:47.763 --> 56:48.885
And there were no editors...

56:48.950 --> 56:51.793
There are no filters that this stuff is going through.

56:52.614 --> 56:57.460
You just hear these schmucks on television talking about the virtues of this and the future.

56:57.500 --> 56:59.523
Again, the golden age coming, right?

56:59.643 --> 57:05.930
Well, they have a department at Brown University, which I'm going to get into, this interactive fiction workshop.

57:05.970 --> 57:11.937
Bob Cooper is running it, where you start a novel and somebody else, the reader, can play with it.

57:11.958 --> 57:17.224
And I wonder if people will be able to fool around with your pictures, for instance.

57:17.244 --> 57:17.404
Why not?

57:17.519 --> 57:19.121
They're already fully around my pictures.

57:19.562 --> 57:22.066
You can get any picture of mine you like on the internet.

57:22.086 --> 57:24.109
You can tattoo it on your back, on your ass.

57:24.369 --> 57:25.551
Anything you like.

57:25.852 --> 57:26.793
I have no control.

57:26.813 --> 57:28.596
I cannot fight anymore.

57:28.936 --> 57:31.660
You used to sue somebody for not asking permission.

57:31.700 --> 57:32.341
Forget it.

57:32.982 --> 57:39.111
But I mean, even worse than that, they can manipulate the actual artwork, the image itself.

57:39.252 --> 57:46.142
What I do is, like a lot of people of my age,

57:47.472 --> 57:50.055
I retreat from the entire situation.

57:50.996 --> 57:51.617
I retreat.

57:52.358 --> 57:54.260
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

57:55.101 --> 57:56.082
I don't want to get email.

57:57.144 --> 57:58.705
I don't want to know nothing about computers.

57:59.306 --> 58:02.250
I don't give a flying fuck about the whole thing.

58:02.270 --> 58:02.810
I'm lucky.

58:03.331 --> 58:06.855
I can sit with my Shakespeare at my keys and draw my pictures.

58:07.035 --> 58:09.959
It is mine, too.

58:09.979 --> 58:11.801
It's so virile, isn't it?

58:11.821 --> 58:14.024
I love it.

58:14.044 --> 58:15.085
I love it.

58:15.105 --> 58:16.787
Thank you.

58:17.037 --> 58:18.319
It's just how I feel.

58:18.339 --> 58:20.001
It's a privilege I've earned.

58:20.462 --> 58:21.323
I can afford it.

58:21.484 --> 58:25.870
I can afford to turn my back on this cockamamie crap culture we're living in.

58:26.331 --> 58:28.795
Fuck everybody.

58:29.796 --> 58:32.780
But your father did... These were stories that he made up.

58:32.801 --> 58:33.722
These were stories he made up.

58:33.742 --> 58:34.002
Yeah.

58:34.824 --> 58:36.426
He only spoke in Yiddish.

58:36.446 --> 58:43.276
It was years later that he began to teach himself English by reading Marvel comics, Superman comics.

58:43.517 --> 58:45.880
He graduated to amazing magazines.

58:46.180 --> 58:48.102
then graduated to books.

58:48.503 --> 58:59.837
We always go Yiddish at home when we were children, and he'd sit and he'd make up stories, and they were all shtetl stories from the old country of how the Poles killed Jews.

59:00.498 --> 59:03.922
That was the basic theme of this was pre-World War II, of course.

59:06.906 --> 59:08.628
Nightmare stories of pogroms.

59:09.189 --> 59:11.472
I mean, I am an insomniac.

59:11.492 --> 59:12.994
I wonder why I'm an insomniac.

59:13.094 --> 59:15.377
That's the story he told us before we went to bed.

59:15.880 --> 59:18.199
I'll give you an example of a story.

59:18.239 --> 59:20.558
I'm going to just turn this tape.
