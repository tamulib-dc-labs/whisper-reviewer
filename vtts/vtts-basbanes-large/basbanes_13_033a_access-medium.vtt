WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:09.998
That will be fine.

00:10.138 --> 00:18.175
That will be perfect.

00:18.762 --> 00:39.882
or most of the things in the library, which is not books, but they include my collection, which is all manuscript books, and the Oriental and the Eros collection, with their wonderful records, books, scrolls, and so forth, music, maps, and the National Foundation.

00:39.902 --> 00:48.330
So it's a fairly wide range, and it goes back from the beginning of the book, it goes back to the beginning of the book, and the origins

00:48.310 --> 01:00.829
most of the world is right up to the present day.

01:01.390 --> 01:15.091
I've just, in the corridor along with my office, I've just passed our latest exhibition, which has come in today in large cardboard boxes, which is the archive of the theatrical agent that we've just bought, and we bought it from her estate.

01:15.111 --> 01:15.431
She's just died.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.254
And it includes no amount of reports of correspondence that have been used for everything.

01:17.234 --> 01:34.146
Now you mentioned British things, but you also have as your mandate, you collect all

01:34.649 --> 01:37.873
Yes, we do.

01:38.354 --> 01:58.041
In 1983, the India Office Library in Redford became part of the British Library, transferred to us by the Foreign Office, and that, of course, was an enormous accession of material relating to the British presence in the Far East, not just

01:58.274 --> 02:13.028
in straight colonial and imperial terms, but in Cading, the East India Company was founded in 1800, with the predecessor of the India Office, which is part of an arm of its government.

02:14.230 --> 02:17.177
So we've got vast archives of all of our Cading links.

02:17.157 --> 02:32.630
with Asia, and also it covers a great deal of the British interest in Oriental cultures.

02:32.650 --> 02:39.916
There's always been a very strong fascination to do with Oriental cultures in this country.

02:39.936 --> 02:45.561
And that has now been amalgamated, the India office now has been wrestled with the old Oriental manuscripts and written books of the British Museum.

02:45.581 --> 02:46.742
So we've got a very, very strong

02:47.195 --> 02:56.344
There's a set of collections on Asian and Oriental cultures in particular for those historic regions.

02:56.364 --> 03:01.489
They include some North African material, but we're not so strong on Africa, thousands of people.

03:02.289 --> 03:13.320
And we are, the library of the whole, is not particularly strong on Latin American material either, where we do collect in that area.

03:13.857 --> 03:17.841
a fascinating aspect because it's not just your own history and culture.

03:17.861 --> 03:18.241
Oh, no.

03:18.461 --> 03:19.803
No, very much not.

03:20.203 --> 03:24.727
And we regard ourselves as being guardians of the world heritage.

03:25.928 --> 03:36.198
And, of course, through digital imaging and various digital devices, we're now able to make that world heritage more available than it has been in the past.

03:36.218 --> 03:41.383
And in a paradoxical way, available to the very sections of the world,

03:41.617 --> 03:46.284
that you're documenting, they may not even have as expensive... Oh, indeed, yes.

03:46.444 --> 03:51.912
We certainly have the finest oriental collections outside Asia.

03:52.152 --> 03:58.041
And we have very close links with libraries in Japan and China, for example, and in India, of course.

03:59.503 --> 04:06.493
Exchanging data, online cataloguing, we exchange with National Diet Library in Japan.

04:07.013 --> 04:17.167
But one of our most exciting digital projects, and I think you're interested in the way that the design is helping.

04:17.387 --> 04:27.942
One of our most exciting and innovative digital projects is based on the Dong Han manuscript, which come from the Dong Han cave.

04:28.242 --> 04:35.814
on the Silk Route in Central Asia, which is now part of Turina.

04:36.675 --> 04:43.626
And this was a cave that was closed in about the 10th century in a Buddhist monastery.

04:43.646 --> 04:49.155
It could be sealed up, containing what was regarded by the Mount Sinai's debris records.

04:49.415 --> 04:50.757
Oh, I've not heard of this.

04:50.737 --> 05:11.707
It was reopened in the very end of the 19th century, and several different explorers, different nationalities, scholars, one by one discovered and purchased material from the cave, and it was scattered.

05:11.727 --> 05:15.512
Some of it came to England through Sir Aurel Stein,

05:15.847 --> 05:17.088
of Hungarian origin.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.530
He had British citizenship.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.252
What was his name again?

05:20.652 --> 05:21.333
Stein.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.034
Did you know that?

05:23.054 --> 05:24.716
There's a book by Stein.

05:24.796 --> 05:27.139
Well, there are several books.

05:27.159 --> 05:28.380
What's his first name again?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.121
Aurel.

05:29.221 --> 05:31.183
He was Mark, M-A-R-T.

05:32.224 --> 05:33.906
Aurel, A-U-R-E-L.

05:35.247 --> 05:35.628
Stein.

05:35.728 --> 05:40.773
He's always known as Sir Aurel Stein.

05:40.793 --> 05:43.776
And Hungarian origin, which became a British citizen.

05:43.796 --> 05:44.757
He was sponsored

05:45.192 --> 05:51.058
jointly by the British Museum of the India, to explore in Central Asia.

05:51.479 --> 06:02.290
And he had several expeditions, four expeditions, during which he caught frostbite and had feet amputated, and God knows what, toes anyway.

06:02.390 --> 06:04.673
It's a very interesting, exciting story.

06:04.713 --> 06:09.698
There's a recent biography of him, by a woman called Annabel Woodcraft.

06:09.948 --> 06:13.173
A British book?

06:13.453 --> 06:14.354
Yes.

06:14.375 --> 06:14.715
W-A-L-K.

06:14.735 --> 06:17.219
I'm about Walker.

06:17.279 --> 06:17.439
A-L-K.

06:17.539 --> 06:19.262
Oh, Walker, basically.

06:19.362 --> 06:22.306
I can't remember the exact title, but it's a sign, in a way.

06:22.326 --> 06:24.069
It's published a lot more years ago.

06:24.089 --> 06:26.633
It almost sounds like the Chirogynesia, in a way.

06:26.993 --> 06:28.996
Is the content more formal?

06:29.016 --> 06:34.344
Was it more... What, the content of the materials that he brought back?

06:34.624 --> 06:35.145
Some of it.

06:35.480 --> 06:47.293
About 60% of it is in the form of Buddhist sutras, religious documents, which have a very formal structure and often are rather tested, I suppose.

06:47.313 --> 06:59.806
But the most exciting thing about the context of the case was that it's a very, very rare fund of material documenting the economic and social history of classical China.

07:01.207 --> 07:03.850
Because, generally speaking,

07:04.825 --> 07:14.123
In Chinese culture, the history of a dynasty would be written by the scribes and scholars of the dynasty.

07:14.143 --> 07:19.354
After the end of the dynasty, the scribes and scholars of the next dynasty.

07:19.434 --> 07:25.686
And then they would destroy the documents because they were written in the definitive version as far as they were confirmed, and that was the end of the century.

07:25.666 --> 07:35.219
So it's very rare to find surviving documentation of ordinary knights in China, especially from that early period.

07:35.800 --> 07:48.518
So what it had in a cave, or those caves, plural, in the monastery, in this monastery in Deng Phan, was material from the 4th to the 10th century.

07:49.493 --> 07:59.666
the classical Chinese period, which had been sealed up, not rediscovered until the end of the 19th century.

07:59.686 --> 08:02.650
Were they meant to be hidden, obscured?

08:02.670 --> 08:04.953
I don't know why they were sealed up.

08:05.514 --> 08:07.136
My colleagues made it.

08:07.156 --> 08:10.761
They were essentially lost to knowledge, to human knowledge.

08:10.881 --> 08:14.526
But how do you spell the name of the cave research again?

08:14.546 --> 08:14.826
Dunfan, D-U-A.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.082
H-U-A-N-G.

08:17.102 --> 08:19.066
H-U-A-N-G.

08:19.086 --> 08:20.067
A-N-G in Huang.

08:20.688 --> 08:34.671
Now, our project is an international project, but we're taking the lead, but it's based on the British Library, and we are marrying up the collections that were dispersed after the cave was opened up.

08:35.258 --> 08:40.906
And there are four main places where there's materials to be found.

08:40.926 --> 08:52.643
That is in Gere, in the British Library, in the Bibliotech National, in Paris, in Petersburg, and in Good King.

08:53.855 --> 09:06.635
with scattered bits in Japan, other parts of China, a lot of very closely related material from other parts of the country in Berlin.

09:06.655 --> 09:16.150
Using very good resolution scanning, we are able to pull together a total catalogue

09:16.788 --> 09:26.663
or to contests in the cave of Des Moines, and even to marry up fragments, you know, where in Paris there may be a fragment for me, a matching fragment of here.

09:27.284 --> 09:40.443
So you can match them on the stage.

09:40.463 --> 09:46.051
In a sense, reassemble a lot of the heritage.

09:46.071 --> 09:51.479
And we just, two days ago, it's very much in my mind, but it's just completely funding from our heritage lottery bank for the next three years' work.

09:51.499 --> 09:51.780
It's all that.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.262
It's not something we can afford to do with our nationality.

09:53.282 --> 09:53.983
This is President of Waller League.

09:53.963 --> 09:58.929
We call it the International Film Film Project.

09:58.949 --> 10:01.051
Is there any literature on it?

10:01.452 --> 10:04.575
Yes, I will make sure I send it to you.

10:05.096 --> 10:09.981
I think I gave away my last leaflet yesterday, so I'll ask you to go and find one for you.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.183
Sure.

10:11.203 --> 10:13.906
That's fascinating.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.850
And we have just a little bit to play.

10:17.870 --> 10:18.711
Some of the original material you'll see.

10:18.731 --> 10:20.393
Do you want to handle the tape of it?

10:23.697 --> 10:29.979
Here's something from my collection.

10:29.999 --> 10:33.572
The Diamond Sutra.

10:34.227 --> 10:45.147
All we've got at the moment on display is a croquis, it's a diamond sutra, because we are engaged in some very delicate conservation work.

10:46.129 --> 10:50.517
And that comes, I think that, am I writing a memory?

10:50.537 --> 10:57.450
I think that's brilliant.

10:57.470 --> 10:57.670
Thank you.

10:58.595 --> 11:28.213
doesn't say but it's it's the earliest example of printing this is the earliest printing this is about that unfortunately the original is in another building at the moment it's about a thousand years before gutenberg i think right well it was it was it was in the in eight something uh this is your gutenberg being used in korea

11:28.463 --> 11:32.027
before this date.

11:32.608 --> 11:37.474
This is the earliest European example.

11:37.494 --> 11:39.877
It's quite a beautiful stage, the decorations there.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.981
I've never ever seen decorations before.

11:43.001 --> 11:49.008
I don't know whether you've got the display of the Timbal Bible in the United States.

11:49.028 --> 11:49.589
I missed it.

11:49.609 --> 11:49.869
No.

11:49.969 --> 11:50.910
What about it?

11:50.930 --> 11:57.578
It's been in New York, and then it was going to the Huntington's.

11:57.598 --> 11:58.099
I missed it.

11:58.400 --> 12:05.026
Our copy, which we bought just last year, is also illuminated rather like this.

12:05.046 --> 12:10.552
It's printed, but with hand illuminations, which is rather nice.

12:10.572 --> 12:12.934
That's a hand, those are hand illuminations there.

12:13.094 --> 12:27.208
I thought you thought that we're at the point that in time that you probably, and I'm sure you've written about this, but it was rather analogous to the Erasmian period, when the text was

12:27.593 --> 12:35.523
people's conception of the text was very fluid, a very changing dynamic from the manuscript text to the printed text.

12:35.563 --> 12:42.071
And very often the marriage of manuscript and print is still going on.

12:42.091 --> 12:48.118
Their whole approach to what constituted the definitive version is being transformed.

12:48.238 --> 12:51.762
I just found a book yesterday that I've been looking for in the Abbott Trithemius.

12:51.983 --> 12:53.905
Of course it was quite...

12:54.779 --> 13:01.245
wrote about this, you know, it was right during that period, it was about 40 years after Gutenberg.

13:01.525 --> 13:03.507
Oh, yes.

13:03.527 --> 13:10.332
And he thought that the printing press was going to destroy the whole concept.

13:12.494 --> 13:14.816
I'm wishing you can't talk to things.

13:14.836 --> 13:15.837
We've been through it.

13:15.857 --> 13:17.999
We have an education service.

13:18.019 --> 13:20.081
This is very nice.

13:20.181 --> 13:23.824
British Library Education Service Primary Schools Workshops.

13:26.268 --> 13:28.912
Sorry.

13:28.952 --> 13:37.184
Chinese books and you're in your purview again.

13:37.204 --> 13:38.145
Yes, that's right.

13:38.205 --> 13:48.079
This wood slip comes from the case of Deng Kwan.

13:49.001 --> 13:49.782
I want to write this down.

13:49.802 --> 13:51.905
It's in the groovy desert.

13:51.925 --> 13:52.005
Yes.

13:53.369 --> 14:02.020
So the conditions were right to preserve it too?

14:02.040 --> 14:05.865
The conditions were right to preserve it.

14:05.885 --> 14:09.970
It's not so good for the explorers, even at the end of the 19th century.

14:09.990 --> 14:15.277
And this is from 206 BC.

14:15.297 --> 14:15.377
Wow.

14:20.909 --> 14:46.392
Do we have an estimated date on that there?

14:46.412 --> 14:47.293
Well, it could be in the early 90th century.

14:47.313 --> 14:49.195
I don't think we have a chance to think of around that.

14:52.263 --> 15:03.819
Okay.

15:03.839 --> 15:08.806
Now this one, does that come from Dunhuang?

15:08.826 --> 15:12.651
I'm not sure.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.911
Yes, that's one here.

15:17.931 --> 15:23.380
This is one of the formal Buddhist manuscripts that I described to you.

15:24.281 --> 15:31.172
Unlike some of the other explorers who came after him, Stein didn't speak Chinese.

15:31.192 --> 15:37.702
He was an amazing linguist and he had about 20 oriental languages but not Chinese.

15:37.722 --> 15:41.288
So he didn't know what he was taking away.

15:41.622 --> 15:53.638
And as a result, that's why about 60% of what he took was all this very formal religious documentation, which is so beautiful, very interesting, the scripts are very interesting.

15:53.658 --> 16:01.909
But then, in fact, he missed another to put up some of the really more fascinating material.

16:02.142 --> 16:09.050
He was judging the whole of the beauty of the physical.

16:10.032 --> 16:11.173
Yes, that's right.

16:11.293 --> 16:17.601
And also, it was a little smash-and-grab ring.

16:17.621 --> 16:22.246
He couldn't spend that long there.

16:22.266 --> 16:22.907
This is from John Brown as well.

16:22.927 --> 16:24.069
What is his name, Sir Argus?

16:24.089 --> 16:26.091
Yes.

16:32.264 --> 16:34.466
It's called the Cave Library.

16:34.486 --> 16:38.790
Well, that's, yes, that's the description.

16:38.850 --> 16:40.972
In fact, it was a dump.

16:41.953 --> 16:48.098
In the Annabel Walker biography, there's a photograph of Stein.

16:48.979 --> 17:00.870
I think in that cave, anyway, you can see, because I have seen, if not in that book, that it was all piled up high, like when the cave was unseen.

17:00.968 --> 17:04.011
It was quite clear that things had just been thrown in.

17:04.352 --> 17:05.753
It was intentional.

17:06.594 --> 17:07.315
Yes.

17:07.455 --> 17:23.572
One of the things that these scribes from classical China did for civil servants was that they would use wood blocks and they would write notes on wood blocks and then shave them off until the wood was all shaved away.

17:23.592 --> 17:26.555
They just went on using it as a notebook.

17:26.575 --> 17:28.377
And there were all these wood shavings

17:28.711 --> 17:41.287
This almost compares, in a way, to the chiroganesia, you think, in a way?

17:41.367 --> 17:43.409
Yes, yes, I think in a sense.

17:43.429 --> 17:47.154
In a sense, where that stuff was, I guess, all thrown away.

17:47.615 --> 17:50.959
Yes, that was the Don Juan stuff was.

17:51.359 --> 17:53.622
And so is Cairo, I think.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.214
Yes, I suppose that's right.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.857
I'm thinking, yes, you're right, you're right.

17:57.937 --> 18:02.143
I'm thinking of Alexandria more, and of course Alexandria is a very different thing, because that was the library.

18:02.163 --> 18:02.763
That's right.

18:02.803 --> 18:08.571
No, no, I'm thinking, they called it the Genesio, and it was part of a synagogue where they found all this buried material.

18:08.591 --> 18:09.612
Oh, right, yes.

18:09.712 --> 18:11.615
So it does compare, yes.

18:11.875 --> 18:18.023
And it was considered a refuse, but there were daily records of ancient, in a way it is.

18:19.707 --> 18:33.428
I have to be kept from the India office building on Blackfriars Road, where they've been since the 1960s, and they will move from there straight into the country, the end of next year.

18:33.448 --> 18:36.894
But we've got these samples on this year.

18:36.914 --> 18:43.904
And we'll have a fabulous collection of Korans.

18:43.924 --> 18:44.365
Thanks to this year.

18:45.948 --> 18:54.230
and financial terms, which is always a problem, that we do have real security worries.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.975
You're not alone in that one.

18:57.203 --> 19:14.546
We're thinking about, in partnership with a commercial publisher, we're thinking about producing a facsimile of one of these, not this particular Quran.

19:14.566 --> 19:17.309
There is a Bayadar Quran, which we've got over.

19:17.329 --> 19:18.971
Is that on paper?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.173
No, I think.

19:21.082 --> 19:28.329
That would be the parchment.

19:28.349 --> 19:30.417
Yes, maybe.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.260
There's a...

19:33.282 --> 19:51.882
A story about our earlier conservation techniques, a story against the libraries, British Museum libraries, that we have some very important Buddhist religious work, some Hindu religious work, and one of the Vedas needed rebinding, and they've rebinded in the past.

19:53.110 --> 20:03.340
You have to be so careful which material is appropriate in which religious work.

20:03.420 --> 20:18.375
In relation to digitisation and several issues, we lent the Lindisfarne Gospels to an exhibition in Newcastle last year.

20:18.642 --> 20:22.566
which was very well attended and we were very pleased to be able to do it.

20:22.746 --> 20:33.416
They're obviously terribly precious and terribly vulnerable, so we don't lend them except to the North East about once in 50 years.

20:34.618 --> 20:46.489
Following that, there has been a campaign mounted by Newcastle Valley Council to say that the Lindisfarne Gospels should be returned to the North East, which is their spiritual home.

20:47.195 --> 21:04.671
And it raises, of course, all sorts of questions about collections and general public access to a world-class inheritance.

21:05.031 --> 21:11.056
And the idea of the original and the sort of mystic sense that inheres in the original.

21:11.917 --> 21:15.160
What we want to do, we can't possibly say that we would

21:15.393 --> 21:20.139
we store this item and then another item and then another one and so on and so forth.

21:20.219 --> 21:34.398
I mean, the whole sort of what we do for displaying manuscripts heritage for the public from all over the world, Christian world heritage, you know, would be sort of decimated.

21:36.480 --> 21:44.691
But what we do want to do is to do a digitised version on our Turning the Pages technology.

21:45.346 --> 21:57.185
of the illuminated pages and decorations in the Lindisfarne Gospel, probably amounting to something like 30 pages.

21:57.205 --> 21:58.207
Amounting to what I'm saying?

21:58.227 --> 22:00.911
Something to the order of 30 pages altogether.

22:00.931 --> 22:03.976
They aren't all as richly decorated as these.

22:07.802 --> 22:12.450
Interesting, you talked about... You call it the turning... Turning the pages, yes.

22:12.785 --> 22:23.194
It's a technology that we've pioneered which will be unveiled officially when we open our exhibition galleries in the new building next March.

22:23.214 --> 22:41.290
And basically it involves extremely high resolution computer photography and then some very sophisticated editing using simulated shadows and so forth so that you can

22:41.472 --> 22:52.082
put your finger on the bottom corner of the computer screen and turn the page and go like this, literally, and the page turns.

22:53.123 --> 23:08.998
So what we can do, Peppa, I hope it will be different from, but in some way better than, having the original just in one place in the region where it originally was produced.

23:09.704 --> 23:24.169
is to provide in several places, with any number, potentially, this very, very expensive hardware with this very, very expensive program, which we call turning the pages.

23:24.189 --> 23:29.738
And schools and the public can come and turn the pages.

23:30.055 --> 23:33.099
They can see all the illuminated pages.

23:33.259 --> 23:38.686
We're not offering to do the whole lot because the damage to the manuscript potentially is so much greater.

23:39.167 --> 23:44.414
But all the decorated pages we're offering to show them, they can see them all at one time.

23:45.135 --> 23:53.245
Whereas now, if you visit the Newspan Gospels, you see this, which is beautiful, but, you know, it's tantalizing.

23:54.119 --> 23:57.703
So it's different from the original.

23:57.984 --> 24:07.535
We would be the very first to say it is not the same as having the original, but in some ways it's actually, there's more access.

24:08.336 --> 24:10.278
Is this the technology that was developed here?

24:10.458 --> 24:12.621
Yes.

24:12.641 --> 24:16.065
Yes, we're very proud of it, but we haven't yet unveiled it.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.407
I mean, I'd come back to see it, actually.

24:18.728 --> 24:23.333
Well, it will be available on a permanent basis in our galleries from next March.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.002
at the new building.

24:25.022 --> 24:26.724
We'll still be working on it.

24:26.864 --> 24:27.605
It's time to come down.

24:27.625 --> 24:27.806
Yeah.

24:28.807 --> 24:38.860
So, it is, I mean, we've displayed it at meetings of our board and preparing the ministers with them, that sort of thing.

24:39.301 --> 24:42.485
But we haven't yet got it to the stage where we can mount it.

24:43.026 --> 24:49.154
We've got two examples mounted on the prototype at the moment.

24:49.174 --> 24:51.497
One is the sport for ours.

24:52.068 --> 24:54.250
which I think is on my hand now.

24:55.051 --> 24:56.092
We'll have a look in a moment.

24:56.572 --> 25:00.836
And the other one is the Leonardo da Vinci notebook.

25:00.856 --> 25:01.276
Which one?

25:01.817 --> 25:02.718
Our notebook.

25:02.938 --> 25:05.801
No, not Bill Gates'.

25:05.901 --> 25:12.246
We were just completing our work on that when Bill Gates announced that he was going to digitise his.

25:13.087 --> 25:19.493
And one of the things you can do with the Leonardo notebook on this technology is...

25:19.642 --> 25:22.306
There's an icon called Mirror.

25:22.887 --> 25:28.396
You press that, and you know he kept his note from the mirror writing.

25:28.416 --> 25:34.225
If you press Mirror, it produces the image so that you can read it.

25:34.245 --> 25:36.027
Now, do I understand this?

25:36.047 --> 25:40.815
You'll be able to buy a CD and do this, or you have to come and see the turning pages that you're in?

25:42.057 --> 25:43.419
Well, it's extremely expensive.

25:44.581 --> 25:47.505
And the hardware at the moment, I mean, it takes...

25:48.717 --> 26:01.582
If we were to do the 30 pages or so of the Lindisfarne Gospel Swift Decoration, you would need a gigabyte of RAM, which means one whole machine all to itself.

26:01.662 --> 26:04.247
So it's not really at this sort of CD-long level.

26:04.267 --> 26:07.493
Well, will it be on a screen or will it be like a physical book?

26:07.633 --> 26:08.976
Yeah, it's on the screen.

26:08.996 --> 26:11.080
It's on the screen, but it's a screen...

26:12.460 --> 26:20.309
where you see the image of the book as close as possible, the same size as the original.

26:20.329 --> 26:30.801
And then you turn, you touch the screen, turn the page, and you can zoom, so you can see an enlargement, digitised enlargement of the detail.

26:30.821 --> 26:35.826
I mean, if you wanted to see the brush strokes, that would guide you.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.308
Will it give you a crinkling sound?

26:38.289 --> 26:40.932
No, I don't think so.

26:41.688 --> 26:47.936
No, he said prinkle when you turn it back.

26:49.017 --> 26:50.760
Parchment is quite silent.

26:50.780 --> 26:51.841
That's right, yeah.

26:51.901 --> 26:56.567
But no, there's not going to be a sound or smell or visual.

26:56.828 --> 26:59.551
And it will be able to return some of the heritage.

26:59.571 --> 27:00.612
In a way, yeah.

27:00.633 --> 27:01.173
Well, yes.

27:01.414 --> 27:07.982
I mean, I think this is the same problem that American libraries and museums face.

27:08.283 --> 27:27.652
we do all over the Western world, it's questioned restitution and nobody can deny that in some instances some of the materials we have were taken from foul means rather than fair, some were purchased, you know, there's a whole spectrum of virtue attaching to why we have these things.

27:27.672 --> 27:34.122
And I think that digital imaging is an enormous step forward in helping us to be

27:34.692 --> 27:43.102
give back the heritage while still taking care of the regional and keeping it within our collections as part of the intricate collection.

27:43.122 --> 27:46.206
You've given me something I hadn't even thought of.

27:46.226 --> 27:48.088
I hadn't even thought of this, you know.

27:48.108 --> 27:50.130
It's like the Elven Marbles, for instance.

27:50.691 --> 27:54.776
It's a whole other issue.

27:54.956 --> 28:01.864
I think with manuscripts, we're on a winning ticket here because you can actually have papers

28:01.996 --> 28:07.284
You can see the whole thing, and that in some ways is better than seeing the original.

28:07.304 --> 28:10.388
With the Elk in marbles, you can't quite see that.

28:10.408 --> 28:11.130
That's right.

28:11.210 --> 28:11.811
It's a different issue.

28:11.831 --> 28:15.376
But I mean, the issue is similar.

28:15.536 --> 28:17.479
It's almost resolving.

28:17.499 --> 28:19.602
It's very exciting.

28:20.163 --> 28:23.708
Do you have anything to speak of the original and what it meant?

28:23.768 --> 28:24.049
Yes.

28:24.069 --> 28:26.352
And I thought maybe you could talk about that a little bit.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.375
Well, that's...

28:29.350 --> 28:31.012
a different issue, isn't it?

28:31.232 --> 28:36.378
I mean, it's all connected with this, with the Lindisfarne gospel.

28:36.398 --> 28:55.618
I don't think people will ever lose a sense of awe at seeing the original, just to be in the presence of something that's survived for that long, or which has attached to it, has been touched and created by somebody they think is special.

28:55.839 --> 28:57.180
I mean, it's just

28:57.768 --> 29:00.050
Another example is the Beatles alone.

29:00.070 --> 29:14.505
We have some manuscripts of the Beatles on display just back through there, and they're also very popular, and they're very special to people who have known the Beatles, who grew up in the 60s, like me.

29:15.806 --> 29:27.117
So, I mean, there are all kinds of reasons, and it's not always what one might describe necessarily as a spiritual feeling, but it's just the thought that this is the original, this really is a place

29:27.485 --> 29:32.933
produce has an irreplaceable importance, I think.

29:34.957 --> 29:44.371
But I think that one must avoid being, I don't want to use a pejorative word, but I was going to say sentimental.

29:44.391 --> 29:53.205
I think if you can use it as a neutral word, one must not allow sentiment to

29:54.451 --> 29:57.495
govern what happens to these artifacts.

29:57.516 --> 30:00.440
It seems to me that the most important thing of all is that they be preserved.

30:01.662 --> 30:07.671
And after that, then, of course, the second most important thing is that there must be access to them.

30:07.931 --> 30:11.536
But unless you preserve them, well, you can't give access.

30:12.257 --> 30:23.614
And national libraries and museums can very often provide very much higher quality preservation and better means of access

30:24.404 --> 30:25.406
some other places.

30:26.688 --> 30:38.810
And then there is also, of course, the question of bringing together a critical mass of a collection rather than just one beautiful object seen out of context.

30:40.172 --> 30:48.808
We have a very large collection, very beautiful manuscripts, Bibles, and other religious texts from other religions from all over the world.

30:49.362 --> 30:55.470
And it's important to people from all over the world to be able to come and see these together in one place.

30:56.331 --> 30:58.394
And it means something to them as it's the original.

30:59.656 --> 31:13.374
It's just as much as it would mean to the people who reside in a particular region to have that single original there.

31:13.394 --> 31:19.082
So there are irreconcilable interests on that.

31:20.041 --> 31:22.605
I can't say how important that is.

31:22.625 --> 31:27.932
It's kind of what we came to discuss.

31:28.133 --> 31:29.214
Thank you.

31:29.535 --> 31:36.425
One of the things that's so beautiful about the Sherburne Missile is its birds.

31:37.006 --> 31:42.073
Some wonderful and very lifelike paintings of birds you get in the margins.

31:42.093 --> 31:49.744
And another thing about it is that we know, as we do with Lindisfarne, we actually know the names of the scribes and the artists

31:51.057 --> 31:52.960
who put the manuscript together.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.904
This is very rare, of course, for this period.

31:55.924 --> 31:58.087
And we have portraits of them.

31:58.107 --> 32:00.290
They keep cropping up.

32:00.310 --> 32:01.391
They're not just there.

32:02.873 --> 32:07.359
They put themselves in all over the place.

32:07.399 --> 32:08.841
They preserve themselves.

32:09.182 --> 32:12.667
I've never seen them actually put portraits of themselves.

32:12.687 --> 32:15.510
This is on loan.

32:15.831 --> 32:19.596
And we are going to have to negotiate to purchase it.

32:20.268 --> 32:35.542
And this is another issue that all libraries and museums are sort of standing face, that we attract loans and deposits, and in the past we've got trepidly put a lot of resource into looking after the material, making them available.

32:36.022 --> 32:44.771
And then a new generation of the family that owns it comes along, they face a new tax bill, and they want to sell it.

32:45.211 --> 32:47.473
We've invested a lot.

32:47.977 --> 33:12.567
uh in in making it available we feel we have an obligation to continue to keep it in the public domain uh something as rare and beautiful as this we feel we must attempt to purchase so of course we again we have to try and raise the money in this case we hate from the heritage lot we fund but that's um

33:12.800 --> 33:15.163
constant pressure on us at the moment.

33:15.183 --> 33:24.155
A lot of the material we've been given on loan is now going to be put up for sale and I don't expect we can keep all the shame.

33:24.175 --> 33:26.738
That's the Duke of Northamble and Toronto, is that correct?

33:26.758 --> 33:29.082
Yes, that's correct, yes.

33:29.102 --> 33:30.183
It's quite beautiful.

33:30.203 --> 33:32.366
And the condition is incredible.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.952
Well, I mean, could you designate it a national present?

33:36.972 --> 33:41.558
No, I don't know, I think it's formfully like that, except that's

33:41.977 --> 33:43.539
There are countries which do that.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.683
You know better than I do which ones.

33:45.703 --> 33:49.088
I think they do this in France.

33:49.288 --> 33:59.864
It has been discussed in this country whether we could produce a sort of, as we do, lift buildings as being of historic importance.

33:59.884 --> 34:04.170
Could we have a sort of lift of works of art and manuscripts?

34:04.522 --> 34:08.987
We decided that that would be a very dangerous route to take.

34:09.067 --> 34:18.117
Partly it would encourage an absolute stampede of people who were afraid that their treasures were about to be listed.

34:19.278 --> 34:26.626
The avoidance and evasion of such a list to me would create more damage.

34:28.188 --> 34:31.271
And it sustains it right here a major masterpiece of English art.

34:31.291 --> 34:31.732
Yes.

34:31.832 --> 34:33.634
Well, we call ourselves

34:34.306 --> 34:37.450
try to call ourselves the National Gallery of Medieval Art.

34:38.171 --> 34:49.085
Because, of course, medieval art is preserved in books and in ways that it wasn't, in walls, chapels and churches and big houses and so forth.

34:49.105 --> 34:58.137
So, I mean, yes, I think the masterpieces of English medieval art is better preserved here than anywhere.

34:59.770 --> 35:20.310
The British Museum collections, which these were, were of course very important foundation collections.

35:20.965 --> 35:21.848
and quite a few.

35:21.868 --> 35:30.115
The Lindisfarne Gospels, for example, were part of the collection of C. Robert Cotton, the Elizabethan antiquary.

35:31.934 --> 35:45.146
we have a priceless collection of medieval and Tudor manuscripts from the collections of Cuffin, which through his air came to the British Museum as one of its foundation collections in 1753.

35:45.626 --> 35:48.188
He's one of the heroes of my first book.

35:48.348 --> 35:49.610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:49.630 --> 35:51.751
Well, forgive me for telling you all about him.

35:51.992 --> 35:55.375
Have you read Colin Tite's Panizzi lecture?

35:55.395 --> 35:56.335
Yes, yes I have.

35:56.516 --> 35:57.096
Oh, good, good.

35:57.196 --> 36:00.439
Well, you know... I used it as a source this morning.

36:00.571 --> 36:01.192
Oh, really?

36:01.352 --> 36:01.633
Good.

36:02.054 --> 36:02.875
Oh, I'm delighted.

36:02.895 --> 36:04.779
Well, that means he's been useful.

36:04.919 --> 36:22.731
Well, of course, there's Cotton, the other people's foundation collections of Sloan and Harley, very closely followed by the Royal Manuscripts of George II, which came to the library, to the Meuse British Museum Library in 1757, four years, I think.

36:23.858 --> 36:26.905
But we go on collecting.

36:27.547 --> 36:36.509
We've just this week learned that we should be able to purchase a leaf in Merovingian script.

36:36.529 --> 36:41.260
And we were lacking Merovingian script, so we're rather pleased about that.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.187
I'm just going to follow up on that statement you just made.

36:45.388 --> 36:47.511
We go on collecting.

36:47.531 --> 36:51.176
You know, there are institutions that have more or less put on hold in collecting.

36:51.196 --> 36:54.340
They feel they have so much, they have to absorb what they have.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.563
We don't have that kind of an attitude here.

36:56.623 --> 36:57.745
Definitely not, no.

36:58.005 --> 37:06.437
Although, because of the budgetary cuts, we think, I am facing at the moment a planned reduction to zero,

37:07.193 --> 37:08.995
in 18 months' time.

37:09.236 --> 37:14.964
We may not have an acquisition budget for manuscripts in 18 months' time.

37:14.984 --> 37:16.386
I'm sure you'll get all comfortable.

37:16.826 --> 37:33.910
Well, my worry is, I mean, this is a glamorous thing, but we have an obligation to continue to preserve the national heritage for future generations, to do for the future what the World of Cotton did for us.

37:36.050 --> 37:40.983
We need to maintain the capacity to purchase.

37:41.003 --> 37:51.932
We've got to be out there in the field with good relationships with dealers, known to have a budget, known to be purchasing.

37:52.081 --> 37:58.907
known to be a place that's worth approaching if somebody needs to sell their family archives or whatever it might be.

37:59.107 --> 38:06.795
And I'm very concerned that if we, even just for a year, which is what's planned, if we go down to zero, this will all begin to integrate.

38:06.815 --> 38:09.457
They'll go elsewhere with the... You don't want that.

38:09.477 --> 38:12.059
Do you have any priorities in your collection?

38:12.179 --> 38:13.961
Yes, well, we build on our strengths.

38:13.981 --> 38:16.123
That's the first priority.

38:16.143 --> 38:20.367
So, for example, we would be interested in additions

38:20.988 --> 38:28.264
really first great edition of the medieval collections, like the Merovingian scriptures that we just come up with.

38:29.273 --> 38:42.467
Our strengths also include statesman's political papers, and we do try to collect those, and that's an area where we would try to wish to increase our strengths in the 20th century.

38:42.487 --> 38:48.653
We're not so strong for the 20th century material, for political papers.

38:48.673 --> 38:57.222
We're very, very strong on English 20th century literary manuscripts, and in fact, pre-20th century works by

38:57.421 --> 39:08.342
Milton, the great galaxy of original manuscripts of 19th century writers and 20th century, the archive I mentioned is just coming today.

39:08.542 --> 39:12.987
the 20th century theatrical collection.

39:13.007 --> 39:14.569
So those are strengths.

39:14.589 --> 39:23.540
And then of course religious materials we're known for and huge numbers of violent groups come together.

39:23.860 --> 39:27.585
So we're always interested in that.

39:27.605 --> 39:30.128
And we're always interested because

39:30.108 --> 39:39.562
and making people's notion of what's important primary material is the theory.

39:39.582 --> 39:42.085
Do you have a budget that you can disclose?

39:42.286 --> 39:42.606
Oh, yes.

39:43.187 --> 39:49.196
I disclose for both.

39:49.256 --> 39:56.166
The overall budget for manuscripts this year, quite badly cut, was a little under £600,000.

39:56.534 --> 39:58.616
But we've actually spent... That's acquisitions, right?

39:58.656 --> 40:00.078
Yeah, acquisitions project.

40:00.118 --> 40:04.342
That was for manuscripts, not for the other materials I'm responsible for.

40:04.843 --> 40:08.307
We've actually spent about 1.5 million.

40:08.667 --> 40:09.908
We've spent a lot of other people.

40:10.369 --> 40:11.430
So you're a player.

40:11.770 --> 40:12.992
You've decided to be a player.

40:13.372 --> 40:21.881
We're the biggest player in manuscripts practicing in this country.

40:21.901 --> 40:25.265
One of the biggest, obviously, in Europe.

40:25.285 --> 40:25.545
And...

40:26.150 --> 40:43.602
Therefore, actually very important as far as the preservation of unique material is concerned, that we should continue to be, because if we were removed from the theme, one of the things that would happen is people would start making small rocks for collecting.

40:44.206 --> 40:46.869
and putting things into the sale rooms straight away.

40:46.929 --> 40:50.233
Collections would be dispersed.

40:50.253 --> 40:51.815
And broken up.

40:52.596 --> 40:53.016
Exactly.

40:53.397 --> 40:54.538
That's the point.

40:54.558 --> 40:56.200
They'd be broken up.

40:56.220 --> 41:06.873
If they go to a university library in the United States, for example, they're going to be publicly available and we can swap the catalogs, digital images or microforms or whatever.

41:06.893 --> 41:08.955
And they're professional people taking care of them.

41:08.975 --> 41:09.916
Well, exactly.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.338
And they're available to scholars.

41:11.358 --> 41:14.061
I mean, it may be an inconvenience, but that's

41:14.395 --> 41:17.079
That's minor.

41:18.721 --> 41:25.691
Last year we were unable to purchase some materials and correspondence of Edward Elgar, the Composer World.

41:27.073 --> 41:42.816
We didn't think we would have the budget to do it, and we were approached privately by the doulas to buy the whole lot, and we said we couldn't do so, and it was broken up into about 38 lots, and some of them were sold to private collectors, some of them remain unsold.

41:43.538 --> 41:44.980
And that's really very sad.

41:45.281 --> 41:46.663
That is.

41:46.683 --> 41:47.284
That's too bad.

41:47.424 --> 41:54.756
We will be more and more effective in that pain, I'm afraid.

41:54.776 --> 41:59.624
That's great.

41:59.865 --> 42:03.952
I don't know how much... Well, David, it's very kind to mention that.

42:05.614 --> 42:10.322
You've got an awful lot of tape in that tiny machine.

42:10.437 --> 42:32.988
As David was kind to mention that, I came to the library from the University of London four years ago and while I was in the University of London I was the administrator of the Institute of Historical Research and I was one of the people appointed to the History Working Group on the National Curriculum.

42:33.008 --> 42:36.833
In the year of 1989

42:38.669 --> 42:53.586
So we spent a large part of unpaid voluntary time in 1969 with the committee of ten of us, which increased to twelve, making recommendations for the national curriculum in history.

42:53.606 --> 43:05.038
So I can't speak from personal experience about a curriculum in literature, but we don't have the same fierceness of debate about the canon.

43:05.098 --> 43:07.461
And of course Shakespeare is...

43:07.964 --> 43:09.526
much closer to us.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.889
Well, it's actually pretty close to us.

43:11.930 --> 43:12.871
Well, he is indeed.

43:12.891 --> 43:17.477
I mean, like Trindle and all the rest of the founders of the modern English language.

43:17.497 --> 43:21.843
But it's a very sad thing, I think, in a manner that one watches with dismay.

43:22.624 --> 43:24.707
But it's not happening here.

43:25.509 --> 43:36.504
Well, I mean, there are just a handful of universities that require English majors to take courses in Shakespeare, Bell, Ruth, Charles, and Spencer.

43:36.524 --> 43:36.604
Yes.

43:37.023 --> 43:39.527
Doubtably they do, but they're not required to.

43:40.829 --> 43:48.782
And Amherst College, one of the great, great colleges in America, recently graduated a summa cum laude in English, who had never taken any of those courses.

43:50.145 --> 43:58.518
I mean, how could he possibly call himself a literature major, but don't call yourself an English major?

43:58.538 --> 43:59.260
That concerns me.

43:59.280 --> 44:02.625
You obviously don't have that same kind of... No.

44:03.061 --> 44:05.524
Lack of focus here, shall we say.

44:05.544 --> 44:14.554
As far as I'm aware, the national curriculum only goes for school children up to the age of 16, which is when compulsory schooling ends.

44:15.615 --> 44:26.888
And in the case of history, greatly to my grief, we were given the task of it was going to be compulsory up to the age of 16, but it was cut back to 14 just after we'd finished our work.

44:27.789 --> 44:32.815
So a lot of what we recommended was immediately irrelevant, and in any case

44:33.014 --> 44:37.198
needed to be redesigned, and it's a fascinating experience.

44:38.079 --> 44:45.866
As far as English is concerned, that is compulsory about the way through literature and language to the age of 16.

44:46.086 --> 44:59.359
But it's at the A-level stage, you know about the system in this country, well, advanced level or A-level examinations taken by school kids from 16 to 18, basically.

44:59.879 --> 45:04.985
My daughter's just about to embark on English history and French.

45:05.005 --> 45:06.967
She's 16.

45:07.327 --> 45:10.390
And you have to choose generally three subjects.

45:10.511 --> 45:13.534
Occasionally, especially if you're doing two maths, you might do four.

45:13.614 --> 45:26.448
But the English curriculum at that level, there are different examination boards, but I don't know of one that does not include Tulsa and Shakespeare.

45:26.989 --> 45:29.211
So in other words, if you've done English at school,

45:29.680 --> 45:35.076
to A level, you already had to do the children in Shakespeare.

45:35.277 --> 45:41.315
And my two children, they put Chaucer in the primary school.

45:41.335 --> 45:42.238
Oh, my goodness.

45:42.893 --> 45:51.722
I can remember my son, I mean, he really rather enjoyed, I think, was it The Nun's Tale, or, you know, he was quite bawdy, whichever.

45:51.742 --> 45:55.305
The Miller's Wife, I think, he was given.

45:55.986 --> 45:58.989
He had to write a sort of poem inspired by the Miller's Wife.

45:59.069 --> 46:02.793
I remember these things, helping Kip with their homework.

46:03.413 --> 46:05.295
So, they do feature.

46:06.957 --> 46:12.242
But, I'm sure there will be people who would attack it, but I think it's unlikely.

46:12.610 --> 46:30.419
We don't, in my opinion, I think, in British culture, we don't suffer... any cultural fashion is not quite so pervasive as it will be in the United States.

46:30.499 --> 46:39.394
So political correctness is not a... it doesn't dominate in the same way.

46:39.830 --> 46:42.192
as it does in the United States.

46:42.212 --> 46:46.637
And you don't get the same sort of intellectual fashions which become a sort of rooted doctrine.

46:47.378 --> 46:47.518
No.

46:48.719 --> 46:51.582
It's a central chapter in this new book that I'm writing.

46:51.602 --> 46:53.083
It's very interesting.

46:53.884 --> 46:55.065
So there's no problem.

46:55.105 --> 46:59.129
There is an understanding of what the core knowledge should be.

46:59.189 --> 47:00.651
There are core knowledge.

47:00.671 --> 47:07.778
Well... I mean, as a historian, I...

47:08.922 --> 47:16.133
rather resist the idea that there is a core knowledge.

47:16.173 --> 47:30.976
But I didn't like what the Thatcher government was trying to do on my subject, which is history, which was to say that it must be very nationalist and it must push the national side.

47:31.237 --> 47:33.360
And they were expecting that we would

47:33.560 --> 47:40.789
put in place an assessment system, which in effect would have said that some facts were more important than other facts.

47:40.809 --> 47:43.253
And as a historian, I resist that.

47:43.473 --> 47:47.318
I think that's... Did that happen?

47:48.359 --> 47:58.833
To a very limited extent, but our working group refused to make such recommendations, and it became very much the centre of a political storm about it.

47:59.394 --> 48:00.495
I mean, we weren't saying...

48:00.847 --> 48:11.599
We were saying everybody should know about Shakespeare and everybody should know about Henry VIII, but we were saying they must do it in the same last steps.

48:11.979 --> 48:24.574
You know, we wanted to leave teachers with the latitude to teach within a chronological framework about 50% of the history of this country, but also the history of other cultures we thought was very important, world history.

48:25.094 --> 48:30.280
And we were told it would be absolutely scandalous for any school child to get away with doing less than that.

48:30.850 --> 48:34.794
half of their historical learning specifically about Britain.

48:35.074 --> 48:37.897
There's a very sort of Little England approach to it.

48:37.917 --> 48:42.242
Well, it sounds like a political agenda was being imposed upon the curriculum to a degree.

48:42.402 --> 48:47.007
Well, I don't know to what extent Satch has realised who was doing it.

48:47.487 --> 48:49.209
It was herself personally.

48:49.970 --> 48:53.673
She took a very close interest, although she's never had a training in history herself.

48:54.995 --> 48:58.258
But there's a very sort of simple approach that says, you know,

48:58.964 --> 49:00.947
national greatness.

49:01.849 --> 49:18.558
So I mean I would agree, I would be standardised if my children did learn from Shakespeare as part of their general education, let alone at the university if they were doing anything.

49:18.638 --> 49:24.128
But I think there's a lot of debate to be had about how far you take the concept of the core

49:24.682 --> 49:32.134
In English literature, it may be a different question from history, and I've addressed it for history.

49:32.154 --> 49:38.604
It's not just history, of course, but we don't have the purpose of her and the foreknowledge program on the university.

49:38.624 --> 49:40.647
I've looked at some of the late curricula.

49:41.428 --> 49:50.442
When we were working on the national curriculum, California and New York both come through the recommended curriculum for history, I think.

49:50.462 --> 49:52.545
It's a very different approach.

49:52.812 --> 49:56.920
there from what we adopted.

49:57.060 --> 50:08.882
A much greater sense of the great national project being unfolded through history, which is not very British.

50:08.902 --> 50:09.944
Can I email you?

50:10.145 --> 50:11.327
Yes, of course.
