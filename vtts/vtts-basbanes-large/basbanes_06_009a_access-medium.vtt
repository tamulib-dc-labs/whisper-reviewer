WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:04.472
Well, it's your agenda.

00:04.492 --> 00:05.753
You go ahead, whatever you want.

00:06.795 --> 00:14.564
I really... Texas is one of the great collecting stories of the last 25 years, 30 years, let's say.

00:15.946 --> 00:23.696
I'm going to be writing a lot of Harvard and Yale, but really I think in this book, I'll be writing more about Texas and Boston University to a lesser degree.

00:23.796 --> 00:27.821
I like the groove and the... Gottlieb.

00:28.041 --> 00:30.464
Howard Gottlieb is a very interesting story, isn't he?

00:30.745 --> 00:32.687
And he certainly...

00:33.072 --> 00:44.548
lacks your means, shall we say, to acquire, and I think what he is acquiring really pales, I think, a comparison of what... Well, it's a different kind of collection.

00:44.668 --> 00:50.717
I mean, this is a major league, a big league... Well, it's just a different... It's different.

00:50.737 --> 00:53.982
Well, as early as 1973, there's a piece in the New York Times.

00:54.723 --> 00:58.548
That's the first reference to Harry Ransom in the New York Times index.

00:58.588 --> 00:58.949
What year?

00:58.969 --> 00:59.149
1973.

00:59.249 --> 01:02.674
In fact, I even have a copy of that.

01:02.992 --> 01:07.579
And I would imagine it was their first profile of Harry Ransom.

01:08.080 --> 01:14.009
At that point in 73, he's been doing this for 15 years, I guess.

01:14.029 --> 01:29.031
And they are then comparing this place, this institution, with the collections of Harvard, Yale, the great, the New York Public Library, the really and truly great American collections.

01:29.492 --> 01:30.754
So he did it in 15 years.

01:31.274 --> 01:44.351
Well, and there were differences, of course, in what he was trying to do, and when he did it, and how he did it, and all of these things are what allowed him to do it.

01:44.371 --> 01:53.242
One aspect of it was, of course, money, but there were a lot of reasons why he was successful other than simply that.

01:53.262 --> 01:59.290
The obvious one, of course, was his recognition of 20th century materials.

01:59.928 --> 02:18.856
He realized that, you know, there's a myth that Texas didn't have anything for them, but the history of the play, I mean, if you look at some of the academic bibliographies in the 40s and 30s, I mean, Texas had some very good strings in 19th century materials and 18th century materials, and it was a respectable library.

02:18.976 --> 02:26.087
As he said, it was a good library, and it was a good library, but it wasn't a great library, and he understood what the great library was.

02:26.489 --> 02:40.231
It had a strong base in English literature, and of course the irony was he felt that he could never compete with, well, Yale had the 18th century with the Boswell Babers and Johnson and the like.

02:41.433 --> 02:51.889
But the irony is, long after his death, we acquired the Pforzheimer Collection, which is that cornerstone of English culture, where you have the first editions of every major work.

02:52.527 --> 02:57.914
Of course, you have the corrections, the first edition of Milton, and the corrections in his own room, and things like that.

02:57.974 --> 03:03.101
As I understand it, that collection had been available for quite a while.

03:03.662 --> 03:05.785
Well, available, it was in private hands.

03:06.566 --> 03:09.390
But, I mean, it could have been purchased, shall we say.

03:10.091 --> 03:11.693
It had been for sale for many years.

03:12.794 --> 03:12.874
Yes.

03:12.894 --> 03:17.000
I wonder why, I mean, did Mr. Forsheimer strike that hard?

03:17.020 --> 03:20.104
I want to see if that had a little tougher negotiator, I wonder.

03:20.405 --> 03:20.986
I don't know.

03:21.406 --> 03:27.691
You know, that was 10 years before I got here, and I don't know that it's... Didn't that come down in 86?

03:27.972 --> 03:28.492
No, no, 82.

03:28.512 --> 03:28.752
82.

03:28.832 --> 03:31.975
82.

03:32.395 --> 03:40.983
It might have gotten near in 83 or 84, but I think the deal was struck in 83.

03:41.783 --> 03:43.845
Yeah, you can check that out.

03:44.085 --> 03:49.450
16 million, which is not, in the grand scheme of things, a tremendous amount of money.

03:50.054 --> 03:53.038
I wonder why somebody else didn't... I'm just... I don't know.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.039
This is not a big deal for me.

03:54.079 --> 03:54.680
I'm just curious.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.423
No, I don't know.

03:57.443 --> 04:16.246
I don't know... I imagine a lot of the institutions that could afford it had a great many of those, like folios and the like, and the institutions that didn't have it, probably very few of them could have afforded it or saw that as an important acquisition.

04:16.327 --> 04:17.848
I want to just make sure we're taping.

04:17.989 --> 04:18.389
Go right ahead.

04:18.409 --> 04:19.150
We've come a long way.

04:20.581 --> 04:25.189
I'm reading to Dr. Staley a piece in the New York Times from January 1, 1973.

04:26.591 --> 04:37.369
And what this piece, I guess the springboard for this piece, and it was an overall, since 1958, he has added $45 million worth of papers and books and materials to the center.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.153
This is 1973, though.

04:40.173 --> 04:47.365
$30 million coming from gifts, and the collection has become so significant that most educators and collectors are now rated on the same level

04:47.969 --> 04:54.038
as the research centers at Harvard and Yale University of the Air Public Library in Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

04:54.819 --> 05:03.611
The springboard for this piece is Dr. Ransom's latest major acquisition as a collection of love letters between the 19th century Mexican Emperor Ferdinand Maximilian and his Empress Carlotta.

05:04.673 --> 05:05.915
The letters were sold for $125,000.

05:05.935 --> 05:09.720
Apparently, they were hidden for more than 100 years.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.863
Nobody knew that they were coming on the market.

05:12.905 --> 05:16.069
How Dr. Ransom got the letters widely coveted in Europe

05:16.420 --> 05:18.722
as well as North America, is not exactly clear.

05:19.443 --> 05:25.029
Dr. Ransom is guarded about revealing his methods of knowing when and where rare books and papers will become available.

05:25.830 --> 05:31.776
We learned that the Belgian royal family was about to release the letters, and an alumnus got an option, as Dr. Ransom's explanation.

05:31.796 --> 05:34.018
The existence of these letters is not commonly known.

05:35.139 --> 05:43.508
Apparently, as Dr. Ransom's direct approach appears to have endeared him to many sources on the University of Texas, his lending collections that other universities thought were theirs,

05:44.399 --> 05:46.501
And then it's a little more background.

05:48.203 --> 05:52.087
Where is the... How Dr. Violet read that to you?

05:53.649 --> 06:06.003
I guess he, I wouldn't say made enemies, but he upset a lot of people in the traditional institutions.

06:06.023 --> 06:11.028
I guess he had a pretty aggressive policy of acquisition.

06:11.048 --> 06:12.330
He has a... Well, go ahead.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.372
Maybe we can just pick it up there.

06:15.432 --> 06:26.307
I think where he really saw this was in auction.

06:26.327 --> 06:36.222
And Lansing thought that a successful auction was at 85, 100 percent of all of the material that would come up under the gavel.

06:36.482 --> 06:44.493
And most people at auction were satisfied with 15 or 20, or targeted particular items.

06:44.513 --> 06:45.034
Lansing frequently watched

06:45.520 --> 06:49.105
and did that extremely well.

06:49.806 --> 06:57.337
You obviously weren't here then, so you can't really speak to the mandate.

06:57.477 --> 07:14.802
My encounter, of course, I was, as provost in the University of Tulsa, we were very active in the modern market, and we had bought the Cyril Conley collection, we bought the Paul Scott, we bought the Rebecca West, and had bought a group of

07:15.372 --> 07:25.345
late 20th century women writers, which now I regret terribly that Texas didn't get them instead of Tulsa.

07:25.526 --> 07:28.349
But those were interesting years, too.

07:28.370 --> 07:42.849
The point I'm making is there were a number of institutions that I'm coming to detail into the story instead of the beginning of it, but competition became much keener because Ransom established a kind of pattern for collecting.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.092
The four or five things that Ransom did that are important

07:45.730 --> 07:49.757
First, of course, is his recognition of 20th century materials.

07:50.218 --> 08:00.977
The second was his recognition of pretextual materials, the abop texts, the notebooks, the diaries, the chapbooks, all of the pre-publication materials.

08:00.997 --> 08:06.126
Of course, if you were collecting in the Renaissance in the 18th century, most of this material wouldn't be available anyway.

08:06.206 --> 08:09.392
It was in the 20th century where large quantities of it were available.

08:09.794 --> 08:16.704
Ransom was very quick to note that the pre-publication materials were of great value.

08:16.724 --> 08:23.333
Not just the letters, which always have had value, but this was the diaries, notebooks, all those kinds of things.

08:23.353 --> 08:27.038
The idea that the text doesn't begin with the first edition.

08:27.058 --> 08:27.499
That's right.

08:27.539 --> 08:32.085
The text, in one sense, ends with the first edition, doesn't it?

08:32.105 --> 08:37.793
And the study of the imagination, it's important to see the whole evolution of it.

08:38.431 --> 08:41.895
And that was an extremely important move.

08:41.995 --> 08:48.683
That's where the whole idea of archives and manuscripts became so important to Manson.

08:48.703 --> 08:50.565
With particular focus on the 20th century.

08:50.585 --> 08:51.066
Of course.

08:51.546 --> 08:54.630
Of course, because that's what was available.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.734
It wasn't that he had any strong predisposition to the moderns.

08:58.675 --> 09:07.425
Manson's own field was in rhetoric, copyright law, and taught a wide range of subjects when he was an English professor.

09:07.979 --> 09:10.322
It's that this is where it was.

09:10.683 --> 09:11.804
This is what was available.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.046
This is what you could acquire.

09:13.667 --> 09:21.377
And he recognized that the 20th century materials were the ones that were going to be studied.

09:21.397 --> 09:25.963
Now, those are important elements in recognizing what he did.

09:25.983 --> 09:34.695
The other thing that, because he was able to acquire such large numbers of things,

09:35.300 --> 09:38.605
he became clearly aware of networking.

09:38.625 --> 09:48.038
You know, you get the papers of so-and-so, but you get the other side of the correspondence here, and both correspondences list party, another party, and then you would get those.

09:48.098 --> 10:05.121
And so, before you know it, for example, with Bloomsbury, you've got the network of all kinds of correspondence, where you can recreate and study in all kinds of ways literary history, and the relationships of authors, the relationship of author culture, and these became extremely important components of what

10:06.181 --> 10:08.364
the Ransom collections are about.

10:09.446 --> 10:20.201
I don't know of many places where you can reconstruct so much historically with primary evidence because of all of these interrelationships and connections.

10:20.221 --> 10:26.730
The Ransom collection and the art collections are enormously, the great strength of them is in 20th century British.

10:26.750 --> 10:34.021
Now there's strength in 20th century American and major international strength in 20th century French literature.

10:34.041 --> 10:34.922
I don't know that any place

10:35.088 --> 10:39.613
in America would be as strong as we were in 20th century French literature.

10:39.633 --> 10:41.936
But, uh... It's largely related to that.

10:41.996 --> 10:42.997
Yes, largely, yes.

10:44.078 --> 10:54.870
The other, the other point, although we were not as broadly strong in 20th century America, we're extremely strong in the 20th century American drama.

10:54.890 --> 10:59.896
We have the papers of Lillian Hellman, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, a lot of Inge.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.019
So, except for O'Neill, you have the great

11:03.522 --> 11:04.904
the notable exception of William.

11:05.184 --> 11:06.105
Yes.

11:06.906 --> 11:09.629
Now, Dr. Miller is living.

11:09.649 --> 11:09.930
Sure.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.393
Now, did he give these to the university, or were these purchased?

11:12.413 --> 11:18.039
Some were given, and then, of course, remember, these were in the days of tax, and some, a lot of it is loan.

11:18.059 --> 11:18.200
Really?

11:18.280 --> 11:19.681
I mean, permanent loan, yeah.

11:19.701 --> 11:21.323
Now, does Mr. Miller come down here?

11:21.363 --> 11:22.745
He has, yes.

11:22.765 --> 11:30.394
In fact, I invited him down about last September or October.

11:30.514 --> 11:33.478
We wanted his wife, who's a remarkable photographer,

11:33.897 --> 11:37.800
and we wanted to have a show of her work.

11:37.901 --> 11:38.741
I collect Miller.

11:39.182 --> 11:40.323
Oh, you're good.

11:41.924 --> 11:45.387
She wrote the preface, of course, to her last night collection.

11:46.388 --> 11:49.491
We have a great photography collection here.

11:49.511 --> 11:50.512
I understand it's majoring there.

11:50.532 --> 11:51.392
Well, I don't know.

11:51.432 --> 11:56.497
I mean, of course, Eastman is stronger, but we have five million photographs, including the world's first.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.579
It's a remarkable collection.

11:58.599 --> 12:02.402
Now, when you say you have five million photographs, does that mean that you have the negative?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.219
Either that or the image, one or the other.

12:05.860 --> 12:13.209
But to say you possess the photograph implies that, I'm new at this figure, implies that you have the negative.

12:13.269 --> 12:14.090
Not necessarily.

12:14.470 --> 12:15.331
Not necessarily.

12:17.474 --> 12:19.617
If you have a signed image, that's a photograph.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.660
That's a photograph.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.924
You said there were about five things that ran some of the records.

12:26.105 --> 12:31.191
Yeah, the fact that it was 20th century number one, two, that he collected the pretexts,

12:31.643 --> 12:34.446
and the pretextual material.

12:34.786 --> 12:40.031
Three, that he was able to network and draw a connection to these people.

12:40.051 --> 12:48.820
A fourth area was why Ransom, one reason why Ransom was so successful was, is because nobody had any real idea of the market.

12:50.401 --> 12:52.844
I mean, people said, well, gee, he's paying too much for those things.

12:52.884 --> 12:54.325
He's pretty much established.

12:54.345 --> 12:59.170
Well, yeah, you're paying too much for an odd manuscripts of $1,400, well,

12:59.453 --> 13:01.495
In 62, you might have been.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.838
Now you pay 60, 80, 100,000.

13:04.138 --> 13:09.244
I'm sure some people thought Rosenbach paid too much when he paid $1,600 for your listings.

13:09.264 --> 13:10.285
Yeah.

13:10.626 --> 13:25.242
So this was always the question, you know, I think the important part and the fifth point that I would make is ransom went against expectations.

13:26.133 --> 13:43.874
People felt, British press especially, felt that the direction that a behemoth like Texas would go, and as the most private collectors who were getting into this, people had a lot of money to pursue folios.

13:43.894 --> 13:49.761
Let's get a pretty Shakespeare folio, because that's kind of the cornerstone of the culture, or let's get a this or a that.

13:50.365 --> 13:59.235
And that's what the British press would expect from a, you know, a gauche Texan out here in the primitive parts of the world.

14:00.035 --> 14:15.512
And instead, he went into an area that they didn't even know that they never did much with, up until Phil Blarkin, who was a librarian at Hull and, of course, a great poet, who talked about a national archive.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.186
and some of the schemes that the British worked, which were very good.

14:19.206 --> 14:23.450
The regional libraries were able to purchase papers, and there were some grants for them to do that.

14:23.470 --> 14:25.432
But up until that time, they was ready to have that done.

14:25.953 --> 14:28.395
You did get a Guggenberg Bible, however.

14:28.415 --> 14:29.356
Yeah, that's late, though.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.277
That's later, yeah.

14:30.357 --> 14:31.178
Much later.

14:31.198 --> 14:34.140
But that, you talk about getting a monument, that is the monument.

14:35.562 --> 14:35.762
Yes.

14:35.782 --> 14:36.363
The monument of Texas.

14:36.643 --> 14:42.268
But Ransom was, was he in line with that?

14:42.288 --> 14:43.069
I think he was dead.

14:43.690 --> 14:45.031
Oh, sure.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.052
No, I think that was 82.

14:46.072 --> 14:50.577
You know, I might have these dates of the Pforzheimer, uh, 85 and then the, and the, and the, and the Gutenberg.

14:50.597 --> 14:52.739
I am a New York Times that was at 86, I think.

14:52.779 --> 14:53.440
The Gutenberg?

14:53.680 --> 14:54.281
The Pforzheimer.

14:54.301 --> 14:54.802
It could be.

14:54.942 --> 14:57.324
It could be, but the negotiations were earlier than that.

14:57.404 --> 14:57.885
Yeah.

14:58.045 --> 15:00.968
Well, then maybe it was the Gutenberg that was 82.

15:01.148 --> 15:02.189
I think the Gutenberg of Gutenberg.

15:02.209 --> 15:03.671
They got from the Pforzheimers, too.

15:03.871 --> 15:04.652
Yeah.

15:04.672 --> 15:05.933
So that's probably the dates, yeah.

15:05.953 --> 15:10.558
His nephew, by the way, is quite a collective Pforzheimer.

15:10.808 --> 15:19.041
He's a charter member of the CIA, and he has the finest collection of intelligence anywhere.

15:19.061 --> 15:23.368
In fact, we're going to see him in Washington.

15:23.949 --> 15:33.363
I guess, also, one thing you didn't mention, or if you did, I missed it, he also decided to put living, which is a departure, isn't it?

15:33.383 --> 15:33.944
Absolutely.

15:34.485 --> 15:38.892
And I think this is where, see, I'm asking you to speculate, and

15:39.530 --> 15:42.093
go back on things you weren't here, so that's not scary to you.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.836
No, but I mean, I know the market.

15:44.856 --> 15:48.601
But on the other hand, you have picked up... Sure.

15:49.482 --> 16:01.015
Yeah, the fact that he bought things directly from writers, this was something new, or relatively new, at least.

16:01.197 --> 16:02.879
from an institutional point of view.

16:02.899 --> 16:06.705
Now, did he identify the writers who were important or who were going to be important?

16:06.725 --> 16:08.087
This is something that you're doing now.

16:08.107 --> 16:12.112
I read some books where you have a list, a short list of writers you could go back to.

16:12.613 --> 16:20.584
No, I don't think that you could say that there was anything done that was systematic at this time, at the time of Ransom.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.148
Ransom is not systematic in this.

16:23.168 --> 16:28.015
You know, no business, I mean, every business, every kind of

16:29.648 --> 16:32.092
institutional aspect of something has a rhythm.

16:32.112 --> 16:37.159
And I think the rhythm of the Ransom Center is not unlike the pattern of libraries everywhere.

16:37.179 --> 16:39.002
And the first thing you do, you've got to sew.

16:39.022 --> 16:39.883
You've got to buy.

16:40.003 --> 16:46.773
And I remember the story someone told of somebody that said, you know, we really have to catalog this grand green material.

16:46.793 --> 16:50.859
There's somebody writing a book, and I know we've got that here, but we can't find it.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.963
He said, Dr. Ransom, couldn't you leave some money aside for cataloging?

16:54.644 --> 16:57.568
And Ransom looked at him and said, I understand what you're saying.

16:57.588 --> 16:58.710
He said, not now.

16:59.028 --> 17:01.671
this was the time to get it before the others started.

17:02.171 --> 17:07.658
I would like, and I guess I've already asked to talk to Alex Strip in his writing of I'm Told a Biography.

17:07.678 --> 17:07.958
Yes.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.161
I really would like to capture some of the flavor.

17:11.362 --> 17:15.266
There must be these incredible exciting times here.

17:15.306 --> 17:29.001
People, as I say in this talk that I gave, I mean, one of the great things about Ransom is the story of the guy who walked in to see Ransom told his, said, you know, I've got a terrible, I've got a terrible faculty situation, I need

17:29.656 --> 17:33.482
He said, I've got a mean dean.

17:33.502 --> 17:38.930
I need travel funds to go to a meeting so I can give a paper and all this.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.334
Ransom talked with him and left the office.

17:41.354 --> 17:42.295
He went home that night.

17:43.617 --> 17:47.182
Ransom just had him on his shoulder and everything.

17:47.202 --> 17:50.127
He went home and took his wife out there and said, Isn't it wonderful to be here?

17:51.088 --> 17:51.950
Nothing was resolved.

17:51.970 --> 17:52.591
Nothing was done.

17:52.631 --> 17:57.798
But Ransom could, in a very short time, elevate expectations.

17:57.818 --> 17:58.920
That got dangerous, too.

17:59.305 --> 18:03.249
I saw a phrase of yours someplace, the myth of Harry.

18:03.269 --> 18:05.231
The myth of Harry Ransom.

18:05.291 --> 18:08.575
What is the myth of Harry Ransom?

18:08.595 --> 18:11.938
Well, sometimes it dissolves as you look at it carefully.

18:11.958 --> 18:25.272
I think the reason it's a myth is because you can get 30 people to talk about Ransom, and what they thought was Ransom's real mission and purpose and everything, and it's amazing how various it can be.

18:25.432 --> 18:28.435
For example, one thing that isn't really thought of as Ransom is that

18:28.820 --> 18:34.706
One of his primary purposes was to build a great undergraduate library, a great general library.

18:34.726 --> 18:37.528
When he went in and bought these collections, he said, why did you buy that?

18:37.628 --> 18:47.638
Ransom said, he said there was a small black university down in Tennessee, down in the south of the state, that needed a library.

18:47.658 --> 18:50.861
He said, sure, we'll get the plums out of it, but it's going down there.

18:50.881 --> 18:51.562
They need books.

18:51.982 --> 18:52.703
They just need books.

18:54.184 --> 18:58.388
To you or to me, it looked like just a fair, average, or even poor collection.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.627
But to those people who have no books, it's important.

19:01.887 --> 19:04.790
You mean he would buy a library, call what he wanted?

19:05.231 --> 19:09.415
Well, potentially call, yeah, and send the books to where they're needed.

19:09.575 --> 19:11.297
And this is when he was chancellor.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.820
He had all these different institutions under his orbit.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.403
He said, Tennessee, did you mean Texas?

19:16.423 --> 19:19.005
Lower Texas, yeah.

19:19.766 --> 19:25.472
The other sense of ransom that you have to keep in mind and you have to recognize is

19:26.009 --> 19:30.953
And that is that unique role that research libraries play in the culture.

19:30.973 --> 19:41.122
And the affinity in the nexus with departments and graduate studies, as those things are institutionalized.

19:41.142 --> 19:48.408
And I think not to recognize that is not to recognize one of the great fabrics of all of this.

19:48.428 --> 19:50.550
Let me explain that.

19:50.570 --> 19:55.054
The first point is, in the 60s, if you recall,

19:55.642 --> 20:02.212
all of these institutions across America were exploding with a post-war, becoming doctoral programs.

20:02.252 --> 20:07.960
There was Southern Illinois, Illinois State, California was building six other places besides UCLA.

20:08.481 --> 20:11.245
Everyone was trying to have a graduate program.

20:11.265 --> 20:16.893
The NDEA, Title IV was out, funding graduate programs.

20:17.033 --> 20:19.937
All of these things were emerging and developing.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.843
There was a tremendous demand to

20:25.747 --> 20:29.070
have research materials, and that was one's linked with respectability.

20:30.351 --> 20:38.618
Besides that, after World War II, the tremendous dominance of new criticism as a method.

20:38.638 --> 20:43.582
New criticism had important implications of the text again.

20:43.602 --> 20:50.608
One, it also established its own canon, what were the writers to be studied.

20:50.628 --> 20:54.792
It made important and it made respectable the study of modern literature.

20:55.885 --> 21:00.890
It also looked at the pretexts and preliminaries of the text.

21:00.910 --> 21:06.116
It was not a kind of bellatristic literary history that focused him.

21:06.916 --> 21:15.986
This development lent itself absolutely naturally to the study of literature in a place like this.

21:16.006 --> 21:24.154
So there were a number of parallel movements which had important cultural

21:24.995 --> 21:28.500
extremely important cultural implications.

21:28.520 --> 21:39.937
The whole business of the academy, as it were, moved in these kinds of directions and were appropriate for Ransom's parallel and appropriate to what Ransom was doing.

21:41.519 --> 21:43.723
The literature itself helped to form the canon.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.225
See, it was respectable.

21:45.265 --> 21:50.833
Students weren't even examined in 20th century literature until the 50s.

21:51.286 --> 21:59.599
And the first dissertation on Joyce was done at Harvard very early, but the next one was 20 years later.

22:00.180 --> 22:03.845
The first academic book on Joyce was 1941 by Harry Levin.

22:04.346 --> 22:07.931
So, I mean, you had this catch-up.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.976
Of course, it wasn't published in America until 1934.

22:11.056 --> 22:12.519
1934, The Woolsey Decision, right.

22:12.599 --> 22:18.087
So you have a lot of things kind of concatenating and coming together.

22:18.421 --> 22:25.829
that made so much of what Ransom did move with the flow of the intellectual life and the humanities.

22:26.310 --> 22:35.720
And I think that's an extremely important factor because it's what gives it, it certainly is what has given it its life flow, its move.

22:35.740 --> 22:37.282
It's become institutionalized.

22:37.882 --> 22:41.807
Had Ransom done all this and these things just sat here, it wouldn't even be a story.

22:42.067 --> 22:44.850
See, Joyce is perfect for you, isn't it?

22:46.012 --> 22:48.535
I think that you're kind of embracing this philosophy.

22:48.595 --> 22:56.342
It's a philosophy I embrace, but for you to be a scholar enjoys, I think it's really appropriate, because modern literature starts.

22:56.803 --> 22:59.265
Well, it's certainly very much there.

22:59.906 --> 23:00.767
Very much there.

23:01.267 --> 23:04.871
Let me just read you a quote from the Times, because it is pertinent to what you're saying.

23:06.092 --> 23:11.898
As fast as material arrives and is arranged, it is open for study to undergraduates as well as to scholars.

23:11.938 --> 23:13.960
Dr. Anthony said it before and that's in the record.

23:14.311 --> 23:20.700
Adding that it had never occurred to the center to restrict use of the Texas collections to local students and scholars.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.081
Right.

23:21.101 --> 23:21.882
Final quote.

23:22.082 --> 23:22.503
I love this.

23:22.703 --> 23:24.005
I don't use this quote.

23:24.025 --> 23:27.009
Collecting is an empty vanity unless it's useful.

23:27.029 --> 23:27.750
That's right.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.732
And a wonderful quote.

23:29.473 --> 23:33.619
You might say, we don't collect treasures, we collect research material.

23:35.221 --> 23:36.683
If I could put it that way.

23:36.703 --> 23:36.803
Yeah.

23:36.823 --> 23:39.427
And you do have some treasures.

23:40.649 --> 23:40.909
But...

23:42.256 --> 23:46.000
You certainly paid king's ransom prices for some of them.

23:46.020 --> 23:47.221
Yeah, absolutely.

23:47.661 --> 24:00.814
But I think that the trust is clearly now research materials, which isn't to say that it isn't important to have those great cultural artifacts of the centuries.

24:00.934 --> 24:01.515
Sure, they are.

24:01.595 --> 24:04.178
And I'm not saying that we wouldn't buy something else.

24:04.198 --> 24:08.702
But mainly what we're doing is research materials.

24:09.053 --> 24:16.043
Now, he had, I guess from the state, a commitment for a million dollars a year to buy a million dollars a year.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.206
It's never clear how much he had.

24:18.307 --> 24:20.470
I guess he had a million dollars.

24:20.550 --> 24:22.533
But of course, he frequently had more.

24:22.613 --> 24:23.875
And he had donors.

24:23.895 --> 24:26.939
Yeah, I mean, he had a million, I guess, from the state.

24:32.107 --> 24:35.792
But clearly, he got much more from benefactors.

24:36.073 --> 24:36.934
Absolutely.

24:37.555 --> 24:44.425
If there is a phase one, phase one would be to cast a wide net and gather.

24:44.826 --> 24:45.206
That's right.

24:45.287 --> 24:45.707
Gather.

24:46.308 --> 24:47.169
And he was a gatherer.

24:47.189 --> 24:48.071
He was a gatherer.

24:48.151 --> 24:54.360
And I don't know if we can quantify it by phases, but what phase would you see yourself?

24:54.420 --> 25:04.255
I think our phase is clearly moving into a much clearer definition of what we are as a research center.

25:04.623 --> 25:07.265
That's clearly one.

25:07.365 --> 25:13.271
Second is to make available in the finest possible way the collections that are here.

25:13.291 --> 25:33.248
And that means fuller cataloging, automation, and it means a research link where we define collections, provides finding lists, provides scholarly guides and aids, establish research agenda, have publication projects of our own material.

25:33.708 --> 25:34.309
In other words,

25:34.525 --> 25:43.817
you begin to see the Manson Center more and more closely defining itself as a research center, and with all of what that implies.

25:46.300 --> 25:47.242
Okay.

25:48.143 --> 26:02.882
This apparently will be recognized if you're going to study 20th century, British, French, American, I guess, and other related, but those are the three primaries, or any number of other areas in the first century.

26:02.902 --> 26:03.823
You have to come here.

26:04.715 --> 26:16.288
But we're also conscious of the fact that in 2020, when we look back on this, I don't want it to be said that we were essentially a great collection for the first half of the 20s.

26:16.628 --> 26:17.349
That's right.

26:17.429 --> 26:18.210
20 years to run.

26:18.250 --> 26:18.791
That's right.

26:19.632 --> 26:32.106
We have, as you get to that kind of that point, that peak, that from the 90s, you're looking ahead to the decade, that

26:32.660 --> 26:35.063
is essentially going to be looking backward.

26:35.083 --> 26:42.351
And we are going to be very, we have programs now that concentrate on post-1950 writers and this sort of thing.

26:42.371 --> 26:47.618
What specifically are you doing to continue the acquisitions?

26:47.638 --> 27:00.953
Specifically, we have, let's give you an example of the kind of thing we do.

27:00.973 --> 27:01.654
It's a full computer print ad.

27:05.077 --> 27:07.421
Is this something I can get?

27:07.441 --> 27:15.274
No, this is just a, first of all, it's a movable piece.

27:15.294 --> 27:17.818
It changes every week or ten days.

27:18.499 --> 27:23.027
But we have writers, and we have about 1,400 writers.

27:23.828 --> 27:27.014
And of those writers, we then set them up in various categories.

27:27.474 --> 27:29.518
Collection evaluation.

27:29.919 --> 27:30.780
Writers are ranked.

27:31.182 --> 27:58.016
Now, they're not ranked simply, yeah, a lot of dealers in the world would, too, as you can imagine, and we have to be sensitive to that, but the important thing, Edward Abbey, born in 1927, it's alphabetical, but we rank these writers one through five, as you can see the different numbers here, but it is not simply on some kind of literary evaluation that we make it.

27:58.036 --> 28:01.020
I mean, for example, Edward Albee is rated four, which might

28:01.203 --> 28:07.212
which is a very high rating on our list, but we also have manuscripts, as you see here, of Albie.

28:07.232 --> 28:07.873
James Baldwin.

28:07.893 --> 28:08.594
Your highest rating is?

28:08.654 --> 28:09.315
It was five.

28:09.555 --> 28:10.737
It was Baldwin, five.

28:10.998 --> 28:11.899
Okay.

28:17.467 --> 28:25.239
Martin Bell would be high, a British poet.

28:25.259 --> 28:25.399
Uh-huh.

28:25.419 --> 28:25.839
Isn't this wonderful?

28:25.860 --> 28:28.223
I don't know if it goes through... How about John Bunga, where he's got his book?

28:29.401 --> 28:30.142
It doesn't matter.

28:30.382 --> 28:40.015
All that's represented here means that their first work was published after... What this means is their first work was published after 1950.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.197
Who prepares this list?

28:42.798 --> 28:47.644
We have our research staff that works on it, but we also consult with the dealers.

28:47.745 --> 28:52.050
We watch catalogs to see who's... We also have a faculty committee.

28:52.435 --> 28:54.497
that looks at this list and works with him.

28:54.517 --> 28:57.240
Now, William Graham, unfamiliar to me.

28:57.780 --> 28:58.781
William Graham is a five.

28:58.801 --> 28:59.582
Why is that?

29:00.123 --> 29:09.832
We have, we feel he's an important figure and knew a great many people, had rich correspondence with him and other people, and we already have a good one.

29:09.852 --> 29:10.633
Kerouac's five, too.

29:12.055 --> 29:15.998
I'm a Lowell native, so Jack Kerouac's from Old Man.

29:16.018 --> 29:16.759
Yes, he sure is.

29:17.780 --> 29:20.603
You have a number of Kerouac things, I guess.

29:20.887 --> 29:21.768
Quite a bit, yes.

29:22.128 --> 29:26.013
Now, you would see Robert Lowe is not on here because his first work was published before 1950.

29:26.633 --> 29:29.316
Bill Kennedy, I would expect to be higher than a three.

29:30.318 --> 29:31.719
Well, but you don't know what a three means.

29:33.361 --> 29:35.063
What does it mean?

29:35.103 --> 29:42.832
See, the first level is representative works, mint copies, representative works.

29:42.852 --> 29:49.459
Second level is more than representative works, but an option to get all copies of each thing that comes out.

29:49.945 --> 29:58.536
The third is representative words plus secondary material that's published also with a look toward manuscript material.

29:58.717 --> 30:00.018
If it's available, exciting.

30:00.098 --> 30:14.718
So a four might be on here because we don't think that four is nearly as good a writer as a two, but we know that someone else already has the manuscript material, so there's no sense in us trying to get anything complete because, I mean, we're glad that someone else is doing it.

30:14.818 --> 30:16.560
And I mentioned Kennedy.

30:16.793 --> 30:18.775
clearly all of this stuff is going to stay in Albany.

30:18.795 --> 30:19.776
Yes.

30:19.897 --> 30:29.147
So the reason why I'm very lucky to show that kind of thing is that it is not necessarily some hierarchy.

30:29.167 --> 30:37.537
Then within this list, we also narrow it down to key writers that were very active in the acquisitions of the material.

30:37.918 --> 30:44.345
And that's a list that we're definitely, you know, put out to the world because every book here will be out there.

30:44.365 --> 30:46.007
No, we keep

30:46.308 --> 31:14.087
pretty much to ourselves but on the other hand people uh know where we are i mean everyone knows what hectic is doing sure here's one of the great uh this is what you'll see this is a picture for you there they are there's that's the the hierarchy of the book world in the 60s can you identify them for me left to right uh jake zeitland jake zeitland is famous drake

31:14.388 --> 31:23.229
The Lady of Barker, Hamill and Barker in Chicago, Bertram Rhoda, famous Margie Cohen, and Lou Feldman of Haskell Viette, and Franklin Gillum.

31:23.930 --> 31:26.075
Franklin's the only one alive now.

31:26.817 --> 31:27.920
This is Lou Feldman here.

31:27.940 --> 31:31.488
Lou Feldman, I guess, was the exclusive agent for... Not exclusive.

31:31.548 --> 31:32.751
He did a lot of the...

31:34.334 --> 31:36.737
I've heard a lot of things about Lou Feltman, you know.

31:36.938 --> 31:37.579
Everybody says, why?

31:37.619 --> 31:40.283
What was the maker of Lou Feltman?

31:40.303 --> 31:41.404
Oh, I'd love for you to do that.

31:41.424 --> 31:42.365
Well, it's a simple one.

31:42.386 --> 31:47.793
It takes, again, it takes... Feltman had capital.

31:47.813 --> 31:50.097
Feltman had capital.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.480
Feltman had capital.

31:52.500 --> 31:56.446
Feltman could hold this stuff for 90 days or 120 days.

31:56.966 --> 31:58.428
Dealers couldn't do that.

31:59.089 --> 31:59.530
Or longer.

31:59.570 --> 32:00.471
He could hold longer.

32:00.491 --> 32:00.932
Longer.

32:01.418 --> 32:04.483
I understand that he actually held stuff for over a year.

32:05.144 --> 32:05.986
He could well have.

32:06.246 --> 32:12.336
I mean, I just haven't studied the dates and times, but I know he could hold them.

32:12.396 --> 32:13.778
Some of it was it, yeah.

32:14.439 --> 32:17.505
Yeah, I mean, he could have held, some things were probably held longer.

32:17.525 --> 32:22.393
I mean, there were so many things going on then, it's hard to know whether you were paying for this then or that then.

32:23.054 --> 32:25.117
But this is one of the ways you make the omelet, I guess.

32:25.197 --> 32:26.079
That's right.

32:26.099 --> 32:26.920
That's right.

32:27.254 --> 32:28.636
You know, there's a great joke.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.098
There was a great joke in the book world.

32:30.118 --> 32:36.907
He said, you know, a book dealer could only afford to have two good customers, especially if one of them was Texas.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.533
I've read a hundred new books.

32:41.553 --> 32:43.376
Sure you have.

32:43.396 --> 32:46.400
But everybody says, but you've got to go to Texas and ask down there.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.862
And I said, well, what do I ask?

32:47.982 --> 32:51.146
Well, the other great one was Jake Schwartz, of course.

32:51.226 --> 32:52.868
I don't know if you heard stories about Jake Schwartz.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.010
I don't know how it'll come out.

32:54.150 --> 32:56.333
Jake Schwartz was...

32:56.650 --> 32:58.672
He brought the Hanley collection.

32:58.693 --> 32:58.993
Yes.

33:00.295 --> 33:00.975
Am I right?

33:00.995 --> 33:01.296
Yeah.

33:01.316 --> 33:04.760
The Hanley story, I was telling Connie about it on the airplane yesterday.

33:04.780 --> 33:05.681
It's fantastic.

33:05.701 --> 33:06.462
It's a great story.

33:07.123 --> 33:08.925
Where would I get something on that, you know?

33:09.746 --> 33:15.053
You know, you had that thing when Ransom, at the celebration down here, Ransom State.

33:15.073 --> 33:16.214
I mean, I'll have to get you that.

33:16.294 --> 33:16.795
Oh, right.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.237
Yeah, yeah.

33:18.277 --> 33:20.059
Hanley was from Bradford, Pennsylvania.

33:20.079 --> 33:20.640
Bradford, Pennsylvania.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.681
His widow was still alive.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.543
She was a ballet dancer.

33:23.563 --> 33:24.384
She's still alive?

33:24.464 --> 33:26.607
Yeah, she was a tool that was still alive.

33:26.941 --> 33:32.592
She sent me a lovely, I think it was a Rupert Brooke or a Rudyard Kipling item the other day.

33:32.612 --> 33:37.641
I mean, do you know the history of, how did this man collect such extraordinary things?

33:37.782 --> 33:40.807
I mean, was Tula part of the collection, do you think?

33:40.827 --> 33:43.212
She came a little later.

33:43.765 --> 33:44.747
She's a belly dancer.

33:44.767 --> 33:45.409
She wrote a book.

33:45.489 --> 33:48.475
Well, and her sister moved in with him, too.

33:48.495 --> 33:52.063
They lived in a house that the insurance company would not... Finally wouldn't insure.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.326
They wouldn't insure the stuff.

33:53.346 --> 33:55.370
There had been paintings hanging in the bathroom.

33:55.390 --> 33:59.158
And, of course, he was such a collector that he'd fill the house and...

33:59.999 --> 34:04.783
and then sell it off, and then start all over again, and end up with more than he had the first time.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.325
You see, that's a syndrome, by the way.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.046
You know, Jerome Curran did that.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.268
Thomas Jefferson did that to a degree.

34:10.288 --> 34:12.770
Thomas Jefferson built three great libraries.

34:12.790 --> 34:16.113
The Library of Congress, the University of Virginia, and then another one after.

34:16.153 --> 34:17.514
I mean, he just took on.

34:17.815 --> 34:18.575
Sure, it is.

34:18.775 --> 34:29.685
Oh, it's a... Jerome Curran, you know, the great... It's fascinating, too, to watch the relationship between the book trade, the private collector, and institutional buying.

34:30.003 --> 34:35.851
It's fascinating to watch how that has moved through the 20th century.

34:36.031 --> 34:36.672
It's tri-par.

34:37.093 --> 34:47.927
And now you've seen where the book for the 60s and 70s, that the private collector moved away from it, moved out of it as a major player, and drifted.

34:47.947 --> 34:53.835
And then, of course, it changed, and now the private collector has moved back in, and it's very, very powerful.

34:54.576 --> 34:59.503
Did I send you the piece where I quote David Reddy himself, who says,

35:00.108 --> 35:05.235
He believes we're in the middle of another great golden age of collecting.

35:05.255 --> 35:05.756
He hopes so.

35:06.157 --> 35:06.657
He hopes so.

35:06.718 --> 35:09.802
And he said, if you have a hundred million dollars, and I laughed.

35:09.822 --> 35:10.062
Yeah.

35:10.583 --> 35:11.825
And he said, don't laugh just yet.

35:11.945 --> 35:16.932
He said, if you have a hundred million dollars, you could build one of the finest private libraries in the world.

35:16.952 --> 35:17.213
Yeah.

35:17.233 --> 35:18.475
Because the stuff is available.

35:18.835 --> 35:20.958
And if you were in painting, you'd maybe get three.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.420
Yeah, well, then that's what he said.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.263
And when I laughed, he said, don't laugh.

35:24.303 --> 35:29.170
He said, I sit in a place where people spend fifty million dollars for one

35:29.639 --> 35:30.581
Masterpiece.

35:30.601 --> 35:39.904
The night before, the evening before the Garden Limited sale, which I attended, a Japanese collector paid $22 million worth of kooning.

35:39.924 --> 35:42.250
This is a living artist, not an actor.

35:42.310 --> 35:43.272
I'm not a living artist.

35:43.292 --> 35:47.783
His reputation still has to be assessed, I guess, or maybe perhaps is secure.

35:48.607 --> 35:54.073
But the whole garden collection, including portfolios of Shakespeare... Well, it's the thing to keep it on.

35:54.093 --> 36:03.463
We talked about knowledge transfer and all of the public, about how quick knowledge moves and everything, and the technology that's associated with it.

36:03.483 --> 36:08.268
Well, one aspect of the 20th century is the solidification of reputations.

36:08.308 --> 36:16.437
I mean, I think when the three of us can sit in this room today and say it's really safe to say that Joyce, Eliot, Faulkner, Proust,

36:17.075 --> 36:20.019
are the figures of the 20th century.

36:20.039 --> 36:23.724
I don't know if in 1890 we could have said that about Keats.

36:24.165 --> 36:30.053
I mean, just if you take this... The greatest poet of one of the left.

36:30.073 --> 36:30.514
Yeah, right.

36:30.534 --> 36:31.776
I mean, I don't know that you could say that.

36:31.796 --> 36:34.780
Of course, he was a short life and all of that.

36:34.940 --> 36:37.964
But what I mean is the so-called kind of canon of literature.

36:38.025 --> 36:43.352
This century has seen a pattern of solidification that I don't think there was ever...

36:43.720 --> 36:46.423
just by sheer knowledge and information exchange.

36:46.563 --> 36:49.306
Let me just finish this Golden Age thing, Bob.

36:50.107 --> 36:53.571
I threw that same thing to Ed Wolf in Philadelphia.

36:53.931 --> 36:55.253
And he said, I don't agree with that.

36:55.453 --> 36:57.415
He said, a lot of great stuff is available.

36:57.455 --> 37:00.879
He said, but can anybody buy a full run of Shakespeare photos for any price?

37:01.320 --> 37:02.041
They're not available.

37:02.481 --> 37:08.648
He said, we at the library company in Philadelphia do not have a complete run of poor Richard's Almanac.

37:08.797 --> 37:11.481
And I'd like to know where one is so we can get one.

37:12.142 --> 37:18.892
In other words, the money might be there, some people might be selling, but you do not have the extraordinary ability.

37:19.633 --> 37:21.936
Well, plus, we're dealing with unique items.

37:22.297 --> 37:27.845
And so it's not a, I mean, you know, if there's a, see, that's where we have a real problem.

37:27.865 --> 37:34.915
I mean, you know, you see a book in a catalog and you say, well, you know, it's a really limited edition, maybe 80 copies, 30.

37:36.137 --> 37:36.998
That's one thing.

37:37.366 --> 37:42.613
But when you see a D. H. Lawrence manuscript, you know, how many times do you get a shot at it?

37:42.633 --> 37:47.640
Well, Metamorphosis, Costa's Metamorphosis went for two mil, two million.

37:47.660 --> 37:51.184
If that's, that's a seminal manuscript, of course it is.

37:51.224 --> 37:56.711
Sure, but if that's two million, what is Ulysses' worth on the open market?

37:56.732 --> 37:57.172
Absolutely.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.056
And would you be there swinging?

38:00.076 --> 38:01.057
You know, I'll tell you.

38:01.818 --> 38:03.200
Let me do a hypothetical.

38:03.220 --> 38:06.985
Well, I'll answer that question of where we would be and where we wouldn't be.

38:07.403 --> 38:09.446
It's not about to happen, number one.

38:09.646 --> 38:10.327
It's not.

38:11.589 --> 38:12.850
We know where it is.

38:13.151 --> 38:21.042
We know that that manuscript, we would measure it in terms of what we had of Joyce, where it wasn't its research value.

38:21.262 --> 38:23.084
There are a lot of manuscripts that we don't even touch.

38:23.205 --> 38:25.267
I mean, there's a stack.

38:25.287 --> 38:26.129
I was gone four days.

38:26.149 --> 38:30.174
There's a stack of probably 13 authors in here of Catherine Ann Porter, D.H.

38:30.234 --> 38:31.997
Lawrence, James Agee, so-and-so.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.979
There's some of those we'll look at very carefully.

38:34.019 --> 38:35.261
There's some that we won't even bother.

38:35.281 --> 38:35.942
We'll just thank them.

38:36.361 --> 38:40.508
Because all of Catherine Ann Porter's material, for example, was at Maryland.

38:40.888 --> 38:48.240
What good is it, really, from the point of view of helping the research, for us to have 19 letters of Catherine Ann Porter's here, if that's all we've got?

38:48.681 --> 38:49.322
We do not find.

38:49.342 --> 38:55.712
Now, the Lilly, which is one of the great libraries, has built their great collections on a different principle, really.

38:56.013 --> 39:03.465
I mean, they've gotten representative things, and they've done that very, very carefully, representative aspects of the library.

39:03.817 --> 39:05.559
writers in certain points.

39:05.739 --> 39:08.421
They maintain a list, short list.

39:08.441 --> 39:08.901
Do they?

39:08.921 --> 39:09.202
Yeah.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.765
That's the first time I saw that, when we put out a book.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.746
We're going up there at some point.

39:15.207 --> 39:15.627
Good.

39:16.348 --> 39:17.589
We already talked to Kegel.

39:17.769 --> 39:17.989
Good.

39:18.149 --> 39:18.870
Kegel's a good man.

39:18.910 --> 39:20.231
And do you know Matheson?

39:20.251 --> 39:20.632
I don't.

39:20.652 --> 39:21.672
Matheson's important.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.134
Building 20th Century Collections.

39:23.154 --> 39:23.974
Do you know that article?

39:24.555 --> 39:26.096
It's an important article.

39:26.116 --> 39:27.518
No, I don't.

39:27.558 --> 39:28.859
Matheson, where was that?

39:28.899 --> 39:31.741
He was the chief head of rare books at Library of Congress.

39:31.781 --> 39:32.642
He's retired now.

39:32.993 --> 39:36.698
But his article appeared in what is called the RBMS.

39:38.079 --> 39:41.283
Are you going to see Sally Leach on your schedule?

39:41.303 --> 39:42.305
Ask her about that.

39:42.365 --> 39:43.546
She's been here for quite a while.

39:43.586 --> 39:44.828
Yeah, she'll be very good.

39:44.848 --> 39:45.589
She'll be right here.

39:45.609 --> 39:52.537
She'll be much more useful than I about the stages of development, as an institution especially.

39:52.557 --> 39:53.238
She's very good.

39:53.258 --> 39:54.660
She's got a good memory.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.043
She's my historical link.

39:57.445 --> 40:00.008
Was this done from life, by the way, this choice?

40:00.089 --> 40:01.550
No, this is Milton Hebel.

40:01.711 --> 40:04.655
He's the poet who did the death mass.

40:04.675 --> 40:07.619
And he, I mean, he's the one who did the grave in Zurich.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.241
By the way, incidentally, everything in here is mine.

40:09.922 --> 40:11.704
I mean, that's a rule I have.

40:11.744 --> 40:15.029
No book from the HRC goes, comes in here.

40:15.109 --> 40:17.592
But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

40:17.612 --> 40:27.385
I mean, I've been to any number of, any number of repositories where... Well, but the difference, I don't know the difference, but my difference is this is a working library, and I've...

40:27.618 --> 40:31.002
You know, I teach a seminar on Joy's on Wednesdays, and I'm writing on Joy's.

40:31.022 --> 40:32.243
We edit a journal on Joy's.

40:32.643 --> 40:34.906
So this is very much a working library.

40:34.926 --> 40:36.367
So you are a collector?

40:36.387 --> 40:37.689
Well, there it is.

40:37.709 --> 40:39.571
That's all the Slocum A's.

40:41.793 --> 40:42.794
That's the Slocum A's.

40:43.795 --> 40:43.975
Wow.

40:44.997 --> 40:45.958
Plus Curiosities.

40:46.638 --> 40:48.721
Where is the Shakespeare and Company?

40:48.741 --> 40:49.762
It's in the blue volume.

40:49.782 --> 40:51.303
I'll show it to you in a minute.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.505
Those are all the translations.

40:52.585 --> 40:56.629
The German, the French, the Japanese, the Danish, the Swedish.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.143
Many of them signed by the translators.

41:00.044 --> 41:03.268
Then I have Joyce's copy of Portrait.

41:03.668 --> 41:09.196
You know, Sylvie B. sent him two copies when he was in Zurich, so here they are.

41:09.616 --> 41:10.457
I have one of those.

41:11.018 --> 41:15.544
But then you can get into really unusual things as a collector with Joyce, as you might imagine.

41:15.704 --> 41:17.286
How long have you been collecting, Doctor?

41:17.306 --> 41:17.807
Since I was a kid.

41:20.032 --> 41:23.575
We might want to talk a little bit about his own personal collection, you know, wouldn't you think?

41:23.595 --> 41:29.500
Now, here's the kind of thing that you ask.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.044
Joyce was, as you know, had severe odds growth.

41:33.064 --> 41:33.764
Very.

41:33.784 --> 41:36.307
And he was in London.

41:36.767 --> 41:40.750
They wanted him to do a recording of I.A.

41:40.771 --> 41:47.256
Richards in Ogden, as is the Orthodox Society, where we can talk about moral interpretations and all that.

41:47.276 --> 41:49.178
They wanted him to leave for Matt Olivia Plurville.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.386
the section in the wake.

41:51.646 --> 41:54.489
Well, he's in the blind, and he remembered a lot of it.

41:55.390 --> 41:56.250
So what did they do?

41:56.871 --> 41:59.493
They posted it on ten boards.

41:59.693 --> 42:00.114
Oh, wow.

42:00.774 --> 42:03.717
And these are the boards, so he could read from them.

42:04.177 --> 42:09.602
You see, Chris, this is deteriorated because of the paper that they used at that time.

42:09.622 --> 42:11.904
This predates the stuff they do on television.

42:12.064 --> 42:13.005
Oh, yeah, yeah.

42:13.025 --> 42:13.726
And the prompt is.

42:15.187 --> 42:18.810
So this is the kind of mania that you get into, Joyce, you know.

42:19.432 --> 42:49.371
but this is something that these are this is a text from which joyce read we know that we have the recording of it so these are the kinds of things that you got the regular or oh yeah yeah when the when the orthognographical institute in organ was uh clearing out and everything i'd have to pick that up do you have a little biographical board that i'll be able on yourself that i'll be able to uh have oh sure but i'll show you a couple other items before i forget

42:49.958 --> 42:56.766
This is the, uh, this is the, uh, the Joyce.

42:57.787 --> 43:01.851
There are three or four good, really, Joyce collections still in private hands.

43:01.951 --> 43:04.694
One's Ronnie Zurbicki in Michigan.

43:04.714 --> 43:06.576
Uh, how do you spell his name?

43:06.596 --> 43:10.661
Uh, it's, uh, DZ, DZ, the, I have got it in there.

43:10.681 --> 43:11.282
That's all right.

43:11.302 --> 43:11.422
Okay.

43:11.562 --> 43:15.386
There's the one of 28 of the Buenos Aires edition.

43:15.406 --> 43:15.766
Oh, boy.

43:16.087 --> 43:18.970
Here's, of course, the, uh, the, uh,

43:22.223 --> 43:22.964
This is it.

43:23.164 --> 43:25.769
Yeah, this is the first to shape the income.

43:25.789 --> 43:28.272
It's a good condition, number.

43:28.293 --> 43:30.216
But, you know, it's very hard to find it.

43:30.416 --> 43:31.718
But it's good.

43:31.818 --> 43:33.280
It's in good shape.

43:34.322 --> 43:37.186
I understand the University has, what, 40 of these or 41?

43:37.206 --> 43:39.250
It's 12, I don't know.

43:39.290 --> 43:39.871
One of the hundreds.

43:40.091 --> 43:40.412
Yeah.

43:41.333 --> 43:42.915
But, you know.

43:42.956 --> 43:44.458
Talk to me a little bit about that.

43:44.518 --> 43:44.858
Yeah.

43:44.879 --> 43:46.140
How would you do that?

43:46.161 --> 43:47.182
It's gilding a lily.

43:49.305 --> 43:49.806
We've got another one.

43:50.027 --> 43:50.307
Why?

43:51.113 --> 43:57.103
Because we've got a collection out of Paris.

43:57.123 --> 43:58.645
We ran it out on Ascension Thursday.

43:58.665 --> 44:00.729
You've got the whole thing right on it.

44:00.749 --> 44:03.052
There was one in there.

44:03.073 --> 44:07.440
Plus there were papers, but you have that Joyce manuscript that says, is there anything left?

44:07.660 --> 44:11.887
We found the missing range in the Philippines Lake Stemma.

44:11.907 --> 44:13.470
Got it here.

44:13.490 --> 44:15.012
This is a little bit out of Paris in March.

44:15.650 --> 44:17.632
Is this something that I'll be able to get?

44:18.513 --> 44:19.915
Is this something... No one knows it yet.

44:20.756 --> 44:23.039
You can get... Where is your book coming out?

44:23.059 --> 44:24.320
A year, a year and a half.

44:24.581 --> 44:26.203
Yeah, well, you can get it after May.

44:27.384 --> 44:27.845
After May?

44:28.405 --> 44:28.666
Yeah.

44:28.686 --> 44:29.887
Who do I call and ask about?

44:30.548 --> 44:31.309
Who do I call?

44:31.349 --> 44:31.930
You call me.

44:32.290 --> 44:34.192
And ask and ask you, what will be the key word?

44:34.212 --> 44:35.133
I'll give you the whole thing.

44:35.174 --> 44:37.536
I'll tell you the whole collection that we got.

44:38.057 --> 44:38.598
It's major.

44:39.799 --> 44:40.560
It's major.

44:41.502 --> 44:43.744
So, you see, this is what you're doing.

44:43.864 --> 44:47.067
This goes back to the, oh yeah, this is what you're doing.

44:47.607 --> 44:52.672
It's one of the last, it's probably the last great George collection.

44:52.692 --> 44:53.373
That's exciting.

44:53.493 --> 44:55.815
I want it as contemporaries.

44:55.835 --> 44:58.077
So, yes, that's what we do.

44:58.437 --> 45:01.320
These are, of course, you know, this is the important Odyssey Press edition.

45:01.360 --> 45:05.083
This is the first Spanish translation that was published in Mexico.

45:05.423 --> 45:07.065
These, of course, are all the different editions.

45:07.525 --> 45:09.467
There's the one with the Eric Gilbo.

45:10.021 --> 45:37.800
first indies regular the bodily head with eric gills this of course look at my piece i didn't realize my piece did that yes it was signed by matisse yeah it is that's the old limited edition ugly book spines loose on it yeah you never see it in good shape it's not an attractive book well yeah there's one of you nevertheless nevertheless here's one you appreciate oh chinese this is the first japanese but here's one you also appreciate

45:39.130 --> 45:40.091
This is appropriate.

45:41.192 --> 45:41.973
The first Gaelic.

45:42.974 --> 45:48.119
Imagine taking Ulysses back to Gaelic.

45:48.659 --> 45:50.201
This is all Ulysses.

45:50.361 --> 45:51.642
What don't you have?

45:51.682 --> 45:54.505
Here's Klumczynski's, the famous Polish translation.

45:54.705 --> 45:56.167
He's the James Bond of Poland.

45:58.890 --> 45:59.430
Ian Fleming.

45:59.871 --> 46:01.112
Yeah.

46:01.132 --> 46:03.374
He's going to be in my book, Ian Fleming.

46:03.394 --> 46:04.355
He's a great book collector.

46:04.375 --> 46:05.356
Oh, he was, yeah.

46:05.376 --> 46:06.297
This stuff went to Lily.

46:06.477 --> 46:07.298
There's the check.

46:08.290 --> 46:08.871
edition.

46:09.472 --> 46:11.074
You know exactly where everything is.

46:11.094 --> 46:12.676
You notice he knows where everything is.

46:12.696 --> 46:13.777
There's one of the French trade.

46:13.797 --> 46:15.780
Here's the Romanian.

46:16.181 --> 46:17.262
We've got them all here.

46:17.603 --> 46:22.549
And these are kind of special editions, you know, the fancier editions, limited.

46:22.589 --> 46:25.393
Then I collected this.

46:25.453 --> 46:29.759
This is the Ulysses, but I also have the one with the, when they did the play, the film.

46:30.060 --> 46:30.300
Ulysses.

46:30.320 --> 46:31.101
That's the same Gil.

46:32.363 --> 46:33.985
That's the bow, yeah.

46:34.486 --> 46:37.690
Now these are all the...

46:39.138 --> 46:41.401
things where his earlier work appeared.

46:42.162 --> 46:44.145
How long did it take you to put this collection together?

46:44.165 --> 46:46.628
Oh, I've been collecting for 20, 30 years.

46:46.748 --> 46:47.770
But, you know, off and on.

46:47.890 --> 46:49.872
That's the first Portuguese done in Brazil.

46:50.714 --> 46:53.417
Here's the Finnegan's Lake.

46:53.437 --> 46:55.160
Now, that's your first American over there.

46:56.121 --> 46:56.341
Right?

46:56.541 --> 46:57.062
This one here?

46:57.122 --> 46:58.444
Isn't that the Random House edition?

46:58.845 --> 46:59.445
This here?

46:59.465 --> 47:00.226
Yeah, right there.

47:00.246 --> 47:02.349
You should have one with a better dust jacket than that.

47:02.509 --> 47:04.212
I have one.

47:04.372 --> 47:05.133
Isn't that amazing?

47:05.153 --> 47:06.255
And I take nothing for it.

47:06.275 --> 47:07.056
Well, you're lucky.

47:07.536 --> 47:08.858
See, these are very early...

47:09.698 --> 47:16.226
Here, of course, is the... Here's the first two essays.

47:16.246 --> 47:17.347
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

47:17.828 --> 47:22.233
There's the two essays.

47:22.253 --> 47:23.154
The Day of the Ravelment.

47:23.215 --> 47:23.715
There it is.

47:23.855 --> 47:26.198
Day of the Ravelment.

47:26.218 --> 47:29.122
Do you like a little... Look at this one, Colin.

47:31.244 --> 47:33.427
It must be Japanese or Chinese one.

47:33.507 --> 47:35.450
I don't know the difference.

47:35.470 --> 47:35.930
Look at this.

47:36.010 --> 47:37.512
In January 1898,

47:37.897 --> 47:40.219
Belvedere College Theatrical Entertainment.

47:41.080 --> 47:42.101
And what do we have here?

47:44.003 --> 47:54.092
We have the Gymnastic Theatrical Entertainment on January 10th and 11th in 1898.

47:55.573 --> 47:58.556
And who do we have playing Mr. Grimstone?

47:59.557 --> 48:00.578
James A. Joyce.

48:01.819 --> 48:03.500
This is what we call ephemera.

48:03.921 --> 48:05.442
Ephemera, but boy.

48:05.462 --> 48:07.684
Ephemera, ephemera, ephemera.

48:08.356 --> 48:12.841
Then these are, you even get into... What don't you have that you'd like to have, though?

48:12.881 --> 48:15.424
We do the Prokosh forgeries.

48:16.886 --> 48:18.227
These are the second edition.

48:18.248 --> 48:20.290
These are all the different editions of chamber music.

48:20.310 --> 48:21.952
Then there's, of course, Ibsen's New Drama.

48:22.693 --> 48:31.263
And then here, you give this a special box because you have... These are the three chamber music.

48:31.323 --> 48:33.285
I had the box made to get them.

48:33.746 --> 48:34.406
All three of them.

48:34.426 --> 48:35.848
That's the seven of the box, by the way.

48:36.723 --> 48:39.934
And it's well worth the investment.

48:39.954 --> 48:42.141
And then, of course, you keep records.

48:42.201 --> 48:47.880
There are other Joyce items that you would be...

48:49.970 --> 48:57.520
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.884
Now, why do you have those two press release photographs?

49:00.924 --> 49:04.729
There's one of Graham Greene I can see up there.

49:04.789 --> 49:06.512
These are either people that I signed them.

49:06.552 --> 49:18.387
There's David Plank, and those are different writers that I got them at the time I was with them or to that effect.

49:18.407 --> 49:19.909
Here's something we enjoy.

49:22.370 --> 49:23.671
You don't see this a lot.

49:24.773 --> 49:28.016
There's the Holy Office, and that's in mint with the eagle.

49:28.617 --> 49:33.042
If you look up there, you'll see the eagle.

49:33.442 --> 49:34.263
Oh, look at that.

49:34.724 --> 49:35.304
Watermark.

49:38.087 --> 49:39.589
It's very hard to get that.

49:39.609 --> 49:43.213
I bought that in 1963.

49:44.294 --> 49:45.856
When did he stop using the middle initial?

49:46.817 --> 49:49.440
Or did he always use it?

49:50.298 --> 49:53.302
When he signed things, he signed James A. Forrest.

49:53.322 --> 49:53.662
Did he?

49:53.682 --> 49:53.782
Yeah.

49:54.303 --> 49:57.086
There's Lucia's ABC Chats that I haven't told.

49:57.106 --> 50:05.377
And then these are some of the very small limited editions of things that came out in Paris.

50:05.617 --> 50:08.040
It never fails to excite you, I can say.

50:08.060 --> 50:12.205
Those are all the different exiles.

50:14.125 --> 50:15.347
This is the interesting thing.

50:15.387 --> 50:17.810
McCosh's bookstore in Minneapolis, St.

50:17.830 --> 50:26.021
Paul, did a facsimile of that two essays that you saw, and reprinted it, and without anything painting in 1957.

50:26.481 --> 50:29.005
That book, it was very expensive in 1957.

50:29.025 --> 50:35.233
It was a $17 book, and then they, now they, that book's about a $150 book.

50:35.253 --> 50:40.740
It just was a... Yeah, really active.

50:41.885 --> 50:44.308
And then you get into association things.

50:44.428 --> 50:49.033
See, this is the kind of thing that you... This is also a scholar's library.

50:49.674 --> 50:57.662
This is a book that was in Joyce's library, from the library of James A. Joyce, another book of the way, Sex Mythology, Including an Account of the Masculine Cross.

50:57.682 --> 50:59.044
This becomes very interesting.

50:59.524 --> 51:02.668
It deals with transmutation of sexual symbols and rituals from the original object.

51:03.309 --> 51:07.473
You begin to see what Joyce did with Finnegan's Wake, with Anna Lydia.

51:07.493 --> 51:08.314
It's a source book.

51:08.699 --> 51:15.848
This is a major library.

51:16.689 --> 51:19.793
It's a major collection here.

51:19.813 --> 51:21.676
We're looking at a very major collection.

51:21.696 --> 51:23.438
Oh yeah, it's one of the big ones.

51:24.700 --> 51:27.844
What don't you have that you still have?

51:27.864 --> 51:34.032
I do not have the limited editions Ulysses signed with Joy.

51:34.265 --> 51:35.687
Matisse signed all of them.

51:35.707 --> 51:39.493
Joyce thought they were so ugly he got tired of signing and quit after about 80 or 90.

51:40.114 --> 51:40.755
I've run it down.

51:40.815 --> 51:43.659
It's always been about $300 or $400 more than I was willing to pay for it.

51:43.699 --> 51:50.830
And I don't like the book, so that's one that I haven't kept up with.

51:51.170 --> 51:53.554
The translations are very strong.

51:53.774 --> 51:56.318
That's one of the really strong things in the book.

51:56.338 --> 52:00.084
You can see all the Doverner's translations and the like.

52:00.144 --> 52:01.746
All that's Joyce material, by the way.

52:01.806 --> 52:02.888
And then, of course, this is secondary.

52:04.184 --> 52:05.085
This is all Joyce.

52:07.229 --> 52:11.836
This is the so-called industry of James Joyce.

52:11.856 --> 52:14.541
I just did this.

52:14.561 --> 52:17.906
This is just to annotate.

52:18.046 --> 52:19.629
That's a bibliography of your collection?

52:20.170 --> 52:22.614
Bibliography of the Important Studies on Joyce.

52:23.034 --> 52:24.597
These are my books on Joyce here.

52:25.258 --> 52:27.642
But this is all alphabetical.

52:27.662 --> 52:31.508
There's the Garland Archive of Joyce.

52:32.298 --> 52:33.299
This is, these are his books.

52:33.319 --> 52:34.641
Yeah, that I've written, yeah.

52:34.661 --> 52:42.532
And that's his bibliography, and edited by this plus, that's a Simon Schuster one.

52:42.552 --> 52:45.437
Yeah, it's Simon Schuster in England and St.

52:45.477 --> 52:48.701
Martin's here, and you know how it seems to go.

52:48.721 --> 52:50.564
This is a good book, this John Quinn book.

52:50.804 --> 52:51.785
Yes, it's a wonderful book.

52:51.846 --> 52:53.067
John Quinn is one of my subjects.

52:53.087 --> 52:56.552
One thing that you should read is in the Nora biography, you know that last chapter.

52:56.572 --> 52:57.494
Brenda Maddox's book.

52:57.514 --> 52:58.575
On the slogan books.

52:58.977 --> 53:01.621
How Slocum started collecting joys and everything.

53:01.641 --> 53:02.282
That's wonderful.

53:03.063 --> 53:09.892
This, of course, is the pre-copy of the chapter that had to be excised in the edition.

53:10.633 --> 53:11.394
Well, I didn't know one.

53:11.434 --> 53:12.075
Yeah.

53:12.135 --> 53:13.998
What chapter had to be excised?

53:15.600 --> 53:17.363
Did we run into a problem here?

53:17.463 --> 53:18.785
We reviewed the book, of course.

53:19.846 --> 53:21.729
I know, but I should have had one of those.

53:21.889 --> 53:24.212
When you review it, there's a letter.

53:24.513 --> 53:27.176
Oh, it's in my other copy, and the kids have it down here.

53:27.196 --> 53:28.478
We're working on some letters, but...

53:28.778 --> 53:32.743
They sent a letter on saying, through an agreement with Stephen Joyce, Ms.

53:32.763 --> 53:34.945
Maddox has agreed to excise this chapter.

53:35.366 --> 53:37.108
So would you please destroy this one?

53:37.248 --> 53:39.851
Well, you can see I destroyed it.

53:39.931 --> 53:46.659
This is the chapter that, uh, called Norris, I guess it isn't, and it's not in the book.

53:47.840 --> 53:51.184
That's the Hoden, that one.

53:51.284 --> 53:53.727
Yeah, that's the Hoden, that one edition.

53:54.287 --> 53:56.110
This, of course, is 1904, which you have to have.

53:56.130 --> 53:57.351
This is the, uh,

53:57.955 --> 54:05.322
the Thom's directory that Joyce used when he was in Trieste.

54:06.263 --> 54:18.594
There's some other things there, but these are the... That's the T-O... Thomas... T-H-O-M, apostrophe, yes, official directory, 1904, and that's the official directory of... Dublin.

54:18.714 --> 54:19.175
Of Dublin.

54:19.195 --> 54:20.796
See, that's how he did all the streets and names.

54:20.916 --> 54:22.358
And so he used that book.

54:24.019 --> 54:25.200
How did he get the names?

54:25.220 --> 54:26.342
The streets of who lived where?

54:26.562 --> 54:26.882
Yeah.

54:27.588 --> 54:29.730
of every priest that he used in the book.

54:29.750 --> 54:30.491
Where did you get this?

54:30.551 --> 54:32.092
I got it out of Dublin.

54:33.053 --> 54:36.956
You got two of them.

54:36.976 --> 54:43.162
Dublin was the earliest city to get electrified transportation now, in spite of its being backward and many other ways.

54:43.502 --> 54:45.864
And this one doesn't have all the electrical maps and the tram.

54:45.984 --> 54:48.847
That's a nice little detail.

54:49.367 --> 54:49.888
Oh, yeah.

54:50.428 --> 54:52.430
And then this section is just as they come in.

54:53.411 --> 54:54.092
These are all new.

54:54.212 --> 54:55.553
I have to get them

54:55.820 --> 55:01.248
catalog, and I write an annual piece on that sort of thing.

55:01.308 --> 55:07.318
What do you, I mean, if you could give it to me in a paragraph, what kind of stimulation do you get from Trace?

55:07.458 --> 55:11.724
Obviously, this is, you're a scholar, but you're also a collector.

55:11.865 --> 55:12.305
Oh, yeah.

55:12.325 --> 55:14.649
And I've been watching you for the last 15 minutes.

55:14.669 --> 55:18.755
I mean, you have been really energized by this collection.

55:18.835 --> 55:24.544
Well, yeah, this is the, obviously, you know, you have a professional interest in it, but you're also

55:25.064 --> 55:31.731
The collector who you begin, you can always tell a collector who's the most genteel when they see something that they don't have.

55:32.552 --> 55:36.976
The signs of avariciousness immediately come to the eyes and the pupils dilate.

55:36.996 --> 55:40.560
No, I mean, that's all part of it, isn't it?

55:40.580 --> 55:45.464
And one collects and one follows the system.

55:46.485 --> 55:48.568
I mean, there are marvelous examples of all kinds of things.

55:48.608 --> 55:53.012
For example, this is this concordance of Douglass.

55:53.515 --> 56:02.064
Here's the size of Dubliners, and here's the conclusion.

56:02.084 --> 56:06.969
This is a testament to German scholarship.

56:06.989 --> 56:09.111
I mean, I wish I could read German.

56:09.131 --> 56:15.638
I've seen so many books referenced at the Widener Library that are... Here's how I print my own copies of the Dubliners.

56:17.119 --> 56:18.701
See?

56:18.781 --> 56:20.603
Well, but you see, what I do is,

56:21.983 --> 56:23.286
So these are your annotations.

56:23.627 --> 56:25.471
I have an interleaved page.

56:26.252 --> 56:27.014
Ah.

56:27.034 --> 56:28.297
So if I want to make notes.

56:29.820 --> 56:36.114
But you see, I have to do that every so often because... I'll show you.

56:36.134 --> 56:40.063
See, mine get a little bit... It was the earlier edition.

56:40.083 --> 56:41.646
And I can throw all these notes away.

56:41.947 --> 56:42.908
and start all over.

56:43.169 --> 56:45.733
You're building an archive as well.

56:46.594 --> 56:48.858
Do you agree with the discrediting of this edition?

56:48.878 --> 57:02.218
Well, as they said in the New York Times, in the New York Review, Kidd claimed that I had endorsed it by keeping it in the Joyce establishment, and my letter vehemently denied that.

57:02.298 --> 57:07.566
I think that the test of it needs to be by sexual scholars, not Joyce scholars.

57:07.968 --> 57:23.648
We're like Richard Ellman, in the sense that Ellman says to Goblin in a letter, he says that, I know that there's no textual evidence that Joyce left this in the manuscript, but it just feels right.

57:23.668 --> 57:25.871
Well, if you feel it or I feel it, it doesn't matter.

57:25.891 --> 57:27.693
I mean, you've lost the technical.

57:28.474 --> 57:35.123
So these are questions that are going to have to be decided, and this is where they're decided, of course, right here.

57:36.757 --> 57:41.341
These are the papers of the bibliographic, the proofreading and inquiry into Ulysses and the corrected text.

57:41.381 --> 57:49.169
Now, if you go through 130 pages of this line by line, I'm not a textual scholar.

57:50.370 --> 57:51.791
Changes of dates, money, I don't know.

57:51.811 --> 57:53.112
I mean, you look at how long this is.

57:53.132 --> 57:54.574
What publication is it for publication?

57:54.614 --> 57:58.017
This is the papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, like Kidd.

57:58.037 --> 58:00.179
I mean, so you're going to have one.

58:00.219 --> 58:03.882
He's going to write one back of me, another 200 pages, and then you're going to debate it.

58:03.963 --> 58:06.645
That makes that a pretty interesting collectible item, then, doesn't it?

58:07.098 --> 58:08.700
Oh, yeah.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.001
All of these things are collectible.

58:10.021 --> 58:10.521
And every stage.

58:10.561 --> 58:12.023
And this is the Joyce Quarterly here.

58:12.043 --> 58:15.567
This is what I edited since I was a kid.

58:15.627 --> 58:15.887
Really?

58:16.087 --> 58:17.268
For six years.

58:17.288 --> 58:18.970
It's fun, you see.

58:18.990 --> 58:19.971
He's edited all of it.

58:20.772 --> 58:23.975
This is what I started when I was a kid, and it's a good journal.

58:24.215 --> 58:27.458
I mean, it covers all kinds of things.

58:27.478 --> 58:29.601
And we keep that going all the time.

58:31.362 --> 58:33.004
And then we just started Joyce's studies.

58:34.064 --> 58:42.712
But, you know, see, I write other, I mean, I've written books on literature and theology, Dorothy Richards, and do you know Jean Rhys, the Welsh writer, English writer?

58:42.732 --> 58:43.412
Oh, yeah.

58:43.492 --> 58:50.298
And I've been working on a lot of women writers, 20th century women novelists.

58:50.318 --> 58:52.380
There's a book I did at Italian.

58:52.400 --> 58:54.282
Where do you get the time to write all these books?

58:54.482 --> 58:55.623
Oh, I used to get more time.

58:55.643 --> 58:56.404
I don't anymore.

58:56.524 --> 59:02.569
Of course, then I see I have full, I have full maps of every date.

59:02.870 --> 59:09.980
that I give the students of Dublin, so we can trace every footstep that Bloom takes.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.342
What do you do on Blues Day?

59:11.963 --> 59:30.709
Well, I'll be in Monaco getting a paper this year, but we always try to get some kind of celebration.

59:30.829 --> 59:31.510
Adrian Monier.

59:32.283 --> 59:35.566
That was Solia Beach's partner.

59:35.666 --> 59:37.168
Yes.

59:37.188 --> 59:37.949
Across the way.

59:37.969 --> 59:40.231
Well, now, here's what I think we ought to do.

59:40.251 --> 59:45.176
You need to get to meet a lot of different people and see a lot of things, and then you ought to check with me.

59:45.516 --> 59:46.437
How long are you here?

59:46.457 --> 59:46.877
Two days.

59:47.218 --> 59:48.038
So you're here tomorrow.

59:48.198 --> 59:48.559
Right.

59:48.579 --> 59:50.481
Then you probably want to see me tomorrow.

59:50.521 --> 59:51.201
I'd like that.

59:51.402 --> 59:51.662
Sure.

59:51.842 --> 59:53.023
Could you have a few other areas?

59:53.163 --> 59:55.626
Yeah, because then you'll know more what you want to cover.

59:55.646 --> 59:56.086
Okay.

59:56.106 --> 59:59.369
Well, I think that it's been a very, very useful introduction.

59:59.489 --> 01:00:02.172
Well, I just thought that I would open up these things and then

01:00:02.759 --> 01:00:06.284
Tomorrow, I have some time.

01:00:06.364 --> 01:00:10.249
I'm giving a talk on Joyce and modernism to the modernist group here.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:15.696
Tomorrow at noon, but I will be free early afternoon.

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:16.758
Great.

01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:18.681
What, do you want to try two?

01:00:19.201 --> 01:00:19.522
Whatever.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:23.026
I haven't really studied Ray's... Ray, I think, will you tomorrow?

01:00:23.046 --> 01:00:24.568
He gave me a schedule.

01:00:24.689 --> 01:00:26.251
I just haven't had a chance to study it.

01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:31.298
Let's see what exactly is going on.

01:00:31.318 --> 01:00:31.618
How's he doing?

01:00:31.902 --> 01:00:33.825
Yeah, my bed bigger is 230.

01:00:35.087 --> 01:00:36.249
You're going to 4.

01:00:39.754 --> 01:00:43.280
You know.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.445
Boy, you're getting a full show, huh?

01:00:46.465 --> 01:00:52.714
Yeah, I mean, I... Well, I want to see Cartland Lake, and I do want to... Yeah, I really think he's got you... Well, Howard told me this.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:53.716
Howard Gottlieb.

01:00:53.756 --> 01:00:55.298
You said I should talk to Cartland Lake.

01:00:55.398 --> 01:00:56.981
Oh, no, you must talk to Lake.

01:00:58.103 --> 01:00:59.665
This woman even must.

01:01:01.653 --> 01:01:04.542
Yeah, you know, Sally Reed's a different one, sir.
