WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:28.114
i was just saying that it is a unique story and i've talked to a number of people obviously i'm not i'm interested not just in the collection and the collections but the building of the collection the motivation i started a number of people who have given me insights

00:28.448 --> 00:34.159
And to Dr. Ransom, the word that recurs over and over is the vision of.

00:34.179 --> 00:42.595
But let's, you know, most of the people I talked to kind of came after the golden, the heady days.

00:42.755 --> 00:45.340
And those were exciting times.

00:45.540 --> 00:50.329
You were here for pretty much the whole ride, I guess.

00:50.630 --> 00:50.710
Yes.

00:50.993 --> 00:54.518
Now, let me say at the outset that this is a good-spirited book.

00:54.538 --> 01:05.756
I mean, I have sensed a degree of anxiety among people, and I don't, you know, I don't know what... Texas has had a lot of cheap shots thrown at it, let's face it.

01:06.236 --> 01:09.041
Particularly from the British press and the critics.

01:09.922 --> 01:10.663
You know, they've been whacked.

01:10.723 --> 01:18.435
I saw the BBC tape yesterday, and they whacked Texas for having, you know, some locks of hair, you know, or...

01:18.888 --> 01:20.931
It's one of our great items.

01:20.951 --> 01:22.453
That's been here for years and years.

01:22.633 --> 01:24.335
Yeah, so-and-so's socks.

01:24.355 --> 01:24.816
Well, listen.

01:24.956 --> 01:26.558
It was here long before I came.

01:26.578 --> 01:27.319
Yeah, well, so what?

01:27.359 --> 01:33.727
I mean, the Massachusetts historical, the Boston Athenaeum has a book bound in human skin, you know?

01:33.847 --> 01:34.909
I mean, you can go all over.

01:34.949 --> 01:36.351
Mark and Gary, no doubt.

01:36.431 --> 01:41.237
You know, I mean, it's kind of, if you cast a wide net, you know, you're going to bring in a lot of other things.

01:41.337 --> 01:45.623
Oh, we had more fun with that collection of oxen hair than anything else.

01:45.643 --> 01:46.684
Great item.

01:47.187 --> 02:00.547
You were here from the very beginning, and I guess it certainly can be said that Dr. Ansem's policies were unconventional, perhaps controversial.

02:00.627 --> 02:05.154
Yeah, he had a great talent in getting money out of the Board of Regents.

02:05.174 --> 02:07.657
Do you have any idea how he was able to do that?

02:11.503 --> 02:13.566
Well, he was a good con man.

02:17.933 --> 02:21.998
I think he was a man with that kind of personality.

02:22.018 --> 02:30.968
I mean, he could make people believe that anything was possible, even whether it was or not.

02:31.628 --> 02:44.683
I think John Silver had a quotation about him, which is a book written by a man named Ronnie Duggan called Iron Bay Universities, which John Silver said.

02:45.575 --> 03:04.117
Ransom's most exciting characteristic was that he couldn't tell the difference between what was possible and not possible, which allowed people a lot of scope.

03:04.137 --> 03:09.403
I forgot exactly what that quotation is.

03:09.423 --> 03:13.388
But it was very interesting, in a very interesting way that that was the truth, and he did this way.

03:13.874 --> 03:17.279
So that was his great genius in getting money.

03:17.299 --> 03:24.850
And he let us buy things in huge amounts.

03:25.311 --> 03:30.118
Did he have a scheme of what he wanted to get, or did he just want to get as much as he could?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.742
Maybe assess its value.

03:32.782 --> 03:43.257
I don't know that he actually set a policy we created in the beginning, rather deliberately, the notion that

03:44.907 --> 03:54.956
create a truly great library, we would have to collect on a certain materials, because, as I say in the speech of mine, you'll get it.

03:55.056 --> 03:58.319
As I say, you may want to ask questions after you read it.

03:58.399 --> 04:04.264
Nobody else was doing it, and they were very, very expensive.

04:04.284 --> 04:14.593
It would not, I don't think there's enough money in the world, for example, to build a collection of the Cannabula, equal to, say, even Yale Harbor.

04:16.177 --> 04:21.865
But there was enough money to build a better 20th century place.

04:21.885 --> 04:32.159
You know, I think, in effect, we've got intellectual history over the first half of the 20th century, and nobody can prove anything, I think, without it.

04:32.179 --> 04:43.855
I have some exhibition calendar, I showed you in May, and nobody invited, really discussed with you the activities that we carried on so many years, which are really kind of at a load now, because

04:44.442 --> 04:51.392
Well, they don't really do the same kind of thing, so.

04:51.692 --> 04:59.604
And, of course, they're having that position of consolidating and doing other good things, so that's beyond the quite fair thing to say.

04:59.924 --> 05:03.930
I just wanted to do a test here and make sure you're right.

05:03.950 --> 05:04.050
Okay.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.993
I'm sorry to interrupt.

05:07.816 --> 05:13.504
Of course, a lot of the interest, the first notice I could find

05:13.990 --> 05:16.914
in the New York Times about Harry Ransom.

05:16.954 --> 05:21.960
The first entry they had on him in their file, in their index file, is in 1973.

05:22.021 --> 05:29.130
So actually, for 15 years, the first profile they did on him was on January 1st, 1973.

05:29.751 --> 05:34.136
And the occasion for that was the acquisition of the Maximilian Letters.

05:35.859 --> 05:42.968
But in the body of that story, they say that Dr. Ransom has angered other institutions

05:44.180 --> 05:53.714
in the United States and abroad for his occasionally controversial methods of acquisition, the way he finds out about things.

05:54.174 --> 06:01.665
Maybe it was sour grapes that they were leading other institutions to the punch.

06:03.648 --> 06:05.070
Did you have a feel for his methods?

06:06.652 --> 06:13.242
You hear the name Lou Feldman thrown around a lot, and White, a lot of other dealers, I guess, who weren't

06:14.251 --> 06:21.121
On the end with Texas, kind of were disturbed that maybe one dealer was getting pretty much most of the action now.

06:22.002 --> 06:25.447
You know that all book dealers are very jealous of each other.

06:25.467 --> 06:25.807
Indeed.

06:25.827 --> 06:26.508
Don't you?

06:26.528 --> 06:27.430
Indeed.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.673
Of course they are.

06:29.693 --> 06:34.880
They don't exactly hate each other, but they... They're jealous of each other.

06:37.524 --> 06:44.173
Frequently, when I went to New York, and I went to New York quite quickly to make contact with dealers,

06:45.048 --> 06:49.015
to see materials and talk with them about things.

06:50.677 --> 06:54.303
Sometimes, if you think about what I know, you go and see the other one.

06:54.344 --> 06:57.609
There were about three people in New York that we dealt with primarily, I guess.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.075
One of them was we dealt with and one of them was Margie Cohen at the House of Books.

07:01.095 --> 07:03.218
I don't know if you remember her or not.

07:03.238 --> 07:03.980
I don't know.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.303
She was a fabulous lady.

07:06.344 --> 07:07.225
Her husband was

07:07.525 --> 07:09.107
She's gone, isn't she?

07:09.127 --> 07:09.969
Oh, yeah, she died.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.653
She was a bus hitter in front of its hotel, London.

07:12.693 --> 07:16.659
She only went to London each and once each year and stayed at the Ritz Hotel.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.064
And I don't know how old she was, but she was really bad.

07:20.144 --> 07:23.710
Because when you went to her shop, she would always sit out for sandwiches.

07:23.730 --> 07:26.354
She would sit there and eat sandwiches for lunch and talk about books.

07:26.374 --> 07:27.355
She loved collectors.

07:27.415 --> 07:28.717
Oh, yeah, she loved it.

07:29.499 --> 07:34.967
But she... Let me see where I've got that picture.

07:35.639 --> 07:38.643
I'll show you something.

07:38.663 --> 07:40.686
I'll set this up.

07:40.706 --> 07:42.569
This is a gorgeous study, by the way.

07:44.612 --> 07:45.633
Are you doing any writing now?

07:46.575 --> 07:49.218
Well, yeah.

07:49.579 --> 07:54.886
I'm a advisor, but we are looking for it.

07:54.906 --> 07:55.647
And I want to do a book of memoirs.

07:55.687 --> 07:57.871
Carlton Lake has a book of memoirs coming out.

07:57.891 --> 07:58.351
Yeah, I know it.

07:58.371 --> 07:59.052
I know it.

07:59.132 --> 07:59.833
I'm looking forward to it.

08:00.274 --> 08:01.756
Let me just get out of here right here.

08:01.776 --> 08:02.457
This is...

08:03.027 --> 08:12.600
at the location of the opening of the Undergraduate Library, which is not the HRC building, but another one is directly west of the main building, which is Undergraduate Library, right.

08:14.563 --> 08:18.068
This is Franklin Gilliam, the Booker Bookshop, who is now in Charlottesville, Virginia.

08:18.629 --> 08:19.410
What's his name again, sir?

08:19.670 --> 08:20.371
Franklin Gilliam.

08:20.631 --> 08:22.514
Franklin Gilliam.

08:24.216 --> 08:32.528
His bookshop was originally, I think, New Haven, and he bought it, and then he moved ahead to New York for a while, then he came to Austin,

08:32.828 --> 08:35.952
San Francisco, now he's in Charlottesville.

08:35.972 --> 08:43.262
This is Lou Phelps, this is Marty Covey, this is Bertram Rowley, this is the Pantheon, isn't it?

08:43.302 --> 08:49.530
Francis Hayman, Jim Drake, and Jacob Leibniz.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.873
How is the right one, I think?

08:52.474 --> 08:55.297
Yeah, he died not long ago.

08:55.358 --> 08:58.802
These are all dead now except this one, except Franklin Franklin and Charlottesville.

08:58.951 --> 09:00.933
Now, what was the occasion of that photograph?

09:01.033 --> 09:03.917
Now, this was the opening of the Undergraduate Library.

09:04.537 --> 09:12.526
Of course, they were all very eager to come, because they always were all on some of the money taxes, so they accepted the invitation to come to this opening.

09:12.546 --> 09:15.790
And we had a kind of a symposium in which I asked the questions.

09:15.810 --> 09:17.452
When, about, approximately when was it?

09:19.334 --> 09:23.539
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't remember.

09:23.559 --> 09:24.079
That's okay.

09:24.119 --> 09:25.441
What is this interesting?

09:25.681 --> 09:28.384
Well, this is a joke.

09:29.039 --> 09:32.784
Yes, sir.

09:32.944 --> 09:35.127
I'd buy in there.

09:35.228 --> 09:36.569
This is Andreas.

09:38.011 --> 09:43.199
Andreas came down here and studied and worked for a while, and I got this picture off of his application.

09:43.219 --> 09:43.639
Oh, that's great.

09:43.659 --> 09:46.663
He was a graduate assistant or something.

09:46.684 --> 09:48.887
But, of course, he was always working.

09:48.907 --> 09:56.397
He used to be like you said, Mark Cohen wasn't certain to kill him, and he was in his wife in Texas.

09:56.765 --> 09:58.588
He wasn't in here, so I put this in.

09:58.648 --> 09:59.669
I had this in here.

09:59.689 --> 10:04.516
When he photographed it, he sent it to Andrea.

10:04.576 --> 10:05.698
Oh, he's playing a character.

10:05.718 --> 10:07.901
Oh, he was a innocent character, yeah.

10:09.203 --> 10:13.749
I can tell you something about Don wanted to be the Rosenstock of the generation.

10:14.350 --> 10:15.151
He wanted to be.

10:15.311 --> 10:15.672
Yeah.

10:15.692 --> 10:16.913
He practically was, I guess.

10:17.214 --> 10:18.055
Did he know his books?

10:19.337 --> 10:19.517
Yeah.

10:20.418 --> 10:21.920
He's an exceptionally well-read man.

10:22.982 --> 10:23.042
Oh.

10:24.473 --> 10:36.468
His father educated him to be a rabbi, and he was fitted to be a rabbi, so he quit, and joined the Marine Corps.

10:38.451 --> 10:48.664
And he was stationed in Washington, and he got married secretly, which he shouldn't have done, without his permission.

10:49.685 --> 10:53.029
So his regimenter

10:53.262 --> 10:58.569
group was ordered to China, and he couldn't go without confessing he was married because he had to get his insurance with it.

10:58.589 --> 11:01.232
So when they did, then the officer said, I'm going to punish you.

11:01.292 --> 11:02.534
You can't go to China.

11:04.216 --> 11:06.739
But anyway, that's where he got, one place he got started.

11:06.779 --> 11:10.083
He ran a rental library from the Marine Post.

11:10.244 --> 11:11.565
He was stationed in Washington somewhere.

11:11.605 --> 11:15.651
I think they were at Fort McNair or someplace like that.

11:15.671 --> 11:15.931
I don't know.

11:15.951 --> 11:23.100
And afterwards, he went, when he got out of the Marine Corps, he went to Long Island, I think, and dealt mostly in

11:23.654 --> 11:29.340
Detective Fiction, and he built the Elder Queen collection for Frederick Genet.

11:29.620 --> 11:33.103
You know, the two Elder Queen people, Frederick Genet and the Elder Queen.

11:33.123 --> 11:36.226
He built that, and we bought that Elder Queen collection.

11:36.246 --> 11:39.109
That was one of the first things we bought.

11:39.129 --> 11:40.931
Well, that wasn't the first thing.

11:40.971 --> 11:44.715
That wasn't really the first thing that was going on.

11:44.735 --> 11:53.003
And then he, I think he inherited a lot of money from his brother, a brother who died.

11:53.489 --> 12:01.317
And he had another brother who was a millionaire in Denver who was in the cattle fattening business.

12:01.957 --> 12:08.564
But Lou was a man who lived up to an image that he was former himself.

12:08.584 --> 12:14.169
With a cane, a gold-headed cane, a magnificent portly figure.

12:15.591 --> 12:16.672
But I'll say one thing now.

12:17.312 --> 12:19.935
Coleman took a lot of flack, and a lot of people said that he

12:20.945 --> 12:23.087
Oh, you know this guy Hamilton, for example, don't you?

12:23.167 --> 12:25.009
You read that Sperilus book you wrote?

12:25.149 --> 12:27.772
I've heard it described as libelous.

12:27.872 --> 12:28.793
Oh, it is.

12:28.833 --> 12:31.115
If you can't libel the dead, unfortunately.

12:31.215 --> 12:31.956
Yeah, that's right.

12:32.777 --> 12:33.838
Well, anyway, it is, yeah.

12:33.858 --> 12:37.101
Well, he said that Feldman and Ransom made.

12:37.121 --> 12:37.642
Okay.

12:38.523 --> 12:40.305
Made millions of dollars out of Texas.

12:40.645 --> 12:43.828
Well, this is an outright lie.

12:43.948 --> 12:48.673
I don't know where the hell Feldman money came from, but if Amwell didn't come from us, I mean, he

12:50.628 --> 12:59.479
I mean, well, I don't know.

12:59.499 --> 13:03.744
We owed him millions of dollars sometimes for two or three years.

13:05.466 --> 13:14.276
And the majority of this, a lot of it was purchases, and he purchased it at 10 percent, the dealer's commission, auctions.

13:14.296 --> 13:16.739
He came in a million dollars that way.

13:16.759 --> 13:20.584
I mean, he had, he would think, I used to have to go to the bank with him

13:21.408 --> 13:25.373
in New York, and said, how do you do, Mr. Banker?

13:25.393 --> 13:29.418
Yes, we do owe this man a lot of money, you know.

13:29.438 --> 13:32.883
I wouldn't have looked at it repeatedly.

13:33.424 --> 13:38.050
So he was, yes, he was borrowing money, but he had enough money to operate anyway.

13:38.070 --> 13:40.253
And he allowed you to buy books?

13:40.953 --> 13:41.414
Well, yes.

13:41.434 --> 13:42.455
Buy credit, basically.

13:42.596 --> 13:43.577
In effect, yes.

13:43.597 --> 13:44.258
A layaway place.

13:44.278 --> 13:45.219
He was a banker for us.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.362
He was a banker for us, yeah.

13:47.402 --> 13:49.845
I mean, people don't really know this.

13:50.382 --> 13:51.844
I don't know that it should be.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.288
I've heard it before.

13:57.473 --> 13:58.534
Did you pay him interest, though?

13:58.554 --> 14:00.317
That's the only question I have.

14:00.457 --> 14:01.799
No, I didn't pay him interest.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.121
We just paid him a commission.

14:03.361 --> 14:07.868
He finally raised his commission to 15%, but we never paid him any interest at all.

14:10.652 --> 14:13.216
So, whatever money he made, he didn't make it here.

14:13.877 --> 14:15.259
I know the rents didn't make any.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.884
So he was agreeable to making purchases?

14:18.904 --> 14:20.566
Well, he wanted to build a collection.

14:20.626 --> 14:21.487
He was a bookman.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.268
He loved books.

14:22.849 --> 14:26.773
He had a compulsion like Carl Lake for buying books.

14:26.793 --> 14:29.897
And Carl Lake, he just said, man, he's got a compulsion for buying stuff.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.259
He admitted as much yesterday.

14:31.279 --> 14:31.559
Yeah.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.702
I interviewed him yesterday.

14:33.762 --> 14:35.925
I was in Paris with him once for a couple of weeks.

14:36.826 --> 14:42.833
My wife and I were over there, and we went with him up on Montmartre, and...

14:44.112 --> 14:50.938
as we were just leaving, oh, that church is up there, you know.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.659
He said, wait a minute, I've got to go see somebody.

14:53.260 --> 15:00.246
And he, for two or three times there, he'd say, wait a minute, I've got to go see, he'd go and see some widow, somebody, that he was keeping in touch with and developing.

15:00.266 --> 15:08.013
You see, that's really the way that we built our collection, was that I kept in touch with these people by corresponding to going to see them, for sometimes for a period of 10 years.

15:08.714 --> 15:13.798
And they'd get up where they wanted to come here, and they'd let them spy and let them get it, because you can't do it.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.923
just by going with money.

15:15.943 --> 15:16.443
They don't like it.

15:16.463 --> 15:18.686
Scouts, they're kind of like scouts.

15:19.166 --> 15:23.270
Yeah, for example, even the dealers.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.972
Could you give me a couple of examples of this?

15:25.012 --> 15:27.414
This is great, I would say.

15:29.716 --> 15:33.420
Well, I don't mean to interrupt your train of thought.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.903
For example, I went to see Pound and Daughter in Murano.

15:37.183 --> 15:38.365
I took with Vercomoda.

15:41.628 --> 15:42.509
That's your Pound.

15:42.529 --> 15:43.009
Yeah, that's your Pound.

15:43.428 --> 15:44.350
They wouldn't accept it.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.073
They wouldn't accept the U.S.

15:46.093 --> 15:50.121
A lot of people wouldn't accept Palma without me or somebody in the university.

15:51.123 --> 15:58.438
And I was the one, when I used to go to New York maybe a couple times a month, I went to Europe two times a year usually for 20 years.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.748
And a lot of these people,

16:03.998 --> 16:09.427
They don't mind taking the money from the dealers, but they're not going to give their stuff to a dealer and let it disappear somewhere.

16:09.447 --> 16:11.411
They want to know that it's coming someplace.

16:11.431 --> 16:14.536
They want to know where it's going and who's going to take care of it.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.477
As a collection, too.

16:15.498 --> 16:17.180
Yeah, right, as a collection, too.

16:17.441 --> 16:18.703
And they want it to stay together.

16:18.763 --> 16:19.504
A dealer gets it.

16:20.005 --> 16:21.989
99 dealers out of 100.

16:23.411 --> 16:25.314
That was our great selling point.

16:25.414 --> 16:29.922
I mean, I can't tell you how many times, but Edmund London, we got his collection.

16:30.509 --> 16:35.394
We'll keep it all together, what we call the Edmund Bunn Collection, who it is.

16:35.414 --> 16:38.097
We have his books with paper, the library, the correspondence, everything.

16:39.058 --> 16:41.440
And this is the only way they would do that.

16:41.761 --> 16:47.487
And you couldn't sit in an office here in London without personal contact.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.869
And you gave people rooms, which is nice.

16:50.910 --> 16:58.558
Well, that's kind of a sore point of ransom problems rooms to everybody, and we had a lot of .

16:58.927 --> 17:01.871
It's kind of like a little Smithsonian over there in some respects.

17:02.172 --> 17:13.068
I don't find it unpleasant, but after... Well, I would arrange it if I had had to be arranging the building, which I didn't, unfortunately, even though I was the director of it.

17:13.088 --> 17:15.251
I'd have put all those public rooms on the bottom.

17:15.611 --> 17:18.856
But anyway... How would you arrange it differently?

17:19.036 --> 17:26.267
Well, I'd have it so that you could get to the public rooms easily downstairs, like a museum area, and then have a library upstairs.

17:26.332 --> 17:30.838
Oh, there are some rooms upstairs that have a lot of stuff I don't know that people ought to be looking at.

17:30.858 --> 17:31.959
Did you go to the seventh floor?

17:31.999 --> 17:33.661
I didn't go to the seventh floor.

17:33.681 --> 17:34.122
Well, you should.

17:34.142 --> 17:36.425
That's a theater collection.

17:36.465 --> 17:41.552
There's a larger collection of the Hester Bateman Silver in the world sitting up there in some glass cases.

17:42.292 --> 17:43.854
And they didn't take me up there.

17:43.895 --> 17:47.619
Well, you should go back and sneak up there, and that's the theater collection.

17:47.659 --> 17:49.161
They've got a wonderful lot of stuff there.

17:50.122 --> 17:51.504
Now, that's kind of museum stuff.

17:51.544 --> 17:54.448
Yeah, that's right, museum stuff, and it's got to be where people can see it.

17:54.918 --> 17:58.482
Of course, the theatrical stuff we used to research a lot of times, too.

17:58.502 --> 18:02.026
I did see theatrical stuff, but I really didn't see it in the museum pieces.

18:02.046 --> 18:15.101
But that Hester Bateman collection was given to us by some woman of East Texas whose husband, and she lived in San Angelo at the time, San Angelo, West Texas, and she gave us the Bateman silver.

18:15.942 --> 18:22.129
And she decided she wanted the carpet for it, so her husband could buy one of the funniest stories that I've ever seen.

18:22.149 --> 18:24.351
I loved it.

18:26.120 --> 18:35.790
She and her husband came and met there, and they had a carpet burn out of San Antonio to bring up, you know, especially wearing carpets.

18:35.810 --> 18:43.058
And they would pull one down and see if they liked it, and they would go to stuff and take it out and try to bring another one up.

18:43.078 --> 18:54.270
Finally, they got one they liked, and there was a kind of young, not too old boy that was very superintending it, and he said, Mr. whatever his name was, I forgot, and I said, now you can take this anywhere you go, I can owe you because

18:54.706 --> 18:58.691
that you paid for the much money.

18:58.711 --> 19:03.136
So I said, I'm going to give you a check for it.

19:05.999 --> 19:12.887
This man has been president of both of the Texas Cattle Raising Association and Texas Sheets and Goal Raising Association, where a few people would have.

19:13.388 --> 19:15.490
But I think that man was absolutely wonderful.

19:15.510 --> 19:18.053
He was just as thankful as he could be.

19:18.934 --> 19:23.700
God, he could come right out of Dallas, you know.

19:24.305 --> 19:27.089
You just pat that boy on the back.

19:27.109 --> 19:28.631
I don't know, give him a check.

19:28.731 --> 19:34.359
I heard a story, a lot of different things, about a fellow that went in to see Ransom.

19:34.379 --> 19:37.843
I heard this from Kathleen G. I hear.

19:37.863 --> 19:41.248
And the man came out and said, well, what did Ransom say?

19:41.268 --> 19:42.930
He said, I don't know, but I gave him $20,000.

19:43.351 --> 19:45.233
He didn't even remember what he gave.

19:45.253 --> 19:48.077
He didn't even remember what he was giving it for.

19:48.297 --> 19:49.719
He was so impressed by this.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.343
Well, that was sort of a joke.

19:52.363 --> 19:53.164
He was a Ransom engineer.

19:54.089 --> 20:01.737
He would lay things out, one, two, three, four, and when you got out, you'd say, two, three, four, and you couldn't remember what they were.

20:01.757 --> 20:04.179
How do you judge the man and his accomplishments?

20:05.221 --> 20:08.103
Well, I don't know.

20:08.164 --> 20:11.847
I don't think I reached a conclusion.

20:12.848 --> 20:22.138
I think it was the fact that he allowed an atmosphere to predominate in which people could

20:22.625 --> 20:24.207
do almost anything he wanted to do.

20:25.848 --> 20:32.636
He never just knowed anybody, and if they could break up the money and get him to break up the money, it would be all right.

20:33.977 --> 20:35.339
I don't fully grasp that.

20:35.539 --> 20:37.501
You mean you've let people do anything they want?

20:37.521 --> 20:42.546
Well, he's, uh, there was no, as I say, there was no discipline.

20:43.528 --> 20:50.455
I mean, uh, any project would be, it's wonderful, let's do it.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.022
And he kind of expected people to do things on their own.

20:54.123 --> 20:55.404
He didn't want to tell them to do it.

20:55.724 --> 21:03.953
He was the idea man, so to speak, of the—not even— No, he was a man who listened to your ideas and let you go ahead and do them.

21:03.973 --> 21:04.894
Without interference.

21:05.174 --> 21:07.336
Yeah, well, yeah.

21:07.356 --> 21:14.564
Unless you happened to cross some ship load or something like that.

21:14.584 --> 21:18.568
And this kind of, I would imagine, puts you in a rather awkward position, because you were—

21:18.987 --> 21:20.810
You were sort of the exact, I guess.

21:21.190 --> 21:21.912
Sometimes.

21:22.172 --> 21:23.734
Sometimes it did, yeah.

21:25.016 --> 21:26.599
I've got a good name going to give you here.

21:26.759 --> 21:27.260
Oh, great.

21:29.103 --> 21:30.565
I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

21:30.585 --> 21:33.550
I don't know whether they showed you any of the exhibition cattle over the line jump.

21:33.650 --> 21:36.755
They really didn't, and I... Well, this is typical of them.

21:36.775 --> 21:38.858
Now, that's Cyril Cotton.

21:39.038 --> 21:46.530
We had a girl working for us, a man, a local brother named Mary Herth, and we bought the...

21:46.747 --> 21:54.616
And she said she wanted to do an exhibit for her.

21:54.636 --> 22:03.166
And so we, in our collections, we did an exhibit.

22:03.186 --> 22:03.907
Is that all 100?

22:04.668 --> 22:04.908
Yeah.

22:04.948 --> 22:05.649
Good for you.

22:05.909 --> 22:06.150
That's okay.

22:06.170 --> 22:07.391
Can I close it to each other?

22:07.411 --> 22:09.273
Yeah, I'm going to give that to you.

22:09.353 --> 22:12.417
I've done this out of it.

22:12.517 --> 22:13.518
Isn't that lovely?

22:13.919 --> 22:15.100
Yeah, I mean, very nice.

22:15.586 --> 22:18.309
Oh, that's a wonderful exhibit.

22:18.409 --> 22:22.172
And this is Cyril Connolly's introduction to it.

22:22.212 --> 22:23.854
Wow, there's a review.

22:25.075 --> 22:28.539
He wrote a review afterwards because of some book he found in there.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.962
Who the hell was it?

22:31.982 --> 22:38.248
Maybe Graham Greene or... Anyway, somebody in the depot there wrote some very unfathomable remarks about it.

22:39.009 --> 22:43.433
Yeah, that gives me a check, because you were able to do this in 1971.

22:43.885 --> 22:44.506
Yeah, right.

22:44.526 --> 22:47.910
These people didn't even start acquiring until 57, 58.

22:47.950 --> 22:48.331
Right.

22:49.132 --> 22:51.735
And within 10 years, you're able to mount.

22:52.236 --> 22:53.137
This is 1964.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.018
Oh, look at that.

22:54.038 --> 22:55.340
Look at that.

22:55.420 --> 22:55.701
That's 100.

22:55.801 --> 22:58.324
You're going to look at that.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.225
100 items, yes.

22:59.325 --> 23:02.910
And this is a little narrow day reduction.

23:02.970 --> 23:05.854
You're not going to have to just write it for me.

23:06.254 --> 23:06.675
Oh, sorry.

23:06.695 --> 23:09.599
I'm sorry.

23:09.619 --> 23:11.622
Yeah, I'm sorry about it.

23:11.642 --> 23:12.002
Now, this.

23:13.720 --> 23:19.489
This is really a magnificent exhibition.

23:19.630 --> 23:24.057
We had a very good, let me see who didn't design for this.

23:24.077 --> 23:25.920
I don't think we had a good designer.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.688
He'd already left us then.

23:31.229 --> 23:34.314
I imported a guy I found on.

23:34.334 --> 23:35.455
I found him that time.

23:36.938 --> 23:38.901
He was teaching at a...

23:39.657 --> 23:48.911
Oh, that radical school in England that let the little girls and boys play with each other if they wanted to.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.453
I don't know.

23:50.473 --> 23:51.555
Well, it's Dartmouth.

23:51.755 --> 23:55.401
It was where all the children of all the actors and actresses went.

23:55.421 --> 23:58.746
And it was one of those very advanced liberal things.

23:58.806 --> 24:00.088
Well, Kim was that way, too.

24:00.749 --> 24:02.792
But he was there, and we did a book together.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.357
And by that time, he'd gone to Zurich.

24:07.130 --> 24:13.560
And he was designing it in Zurich, and he was being prayed for a friend of his carnival, and I was in Italy teaching it at the University of Pisa.

24:14.321 --> 24:18.148
And we were trying to get Ransom to give us the money that he promised in 1957.

24:18.769 --> 24:27.983
And anyway, afterward, we got him to come over here, and we kept him here for about 10 or 20 years, and he designed this, he designed this.

24:28.664 --> 24:31.849
I mean, his design is just absolutely beautiful.

24:31.889 --> 24:34.774
Oh, he was the most, I think, most beautiful.

24:34.990 --> 24:37.874
He came close to being a genius.

24:38.195 --> 24:43.563
He could draw, he could write, he could design, topography, layouts and everything.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.046
And this is an Ezra Pound exhibit that we have.

24:46.067 --> 24:50.012
It's symposium with Pound's daughter and a lot of other people.

24:50.513 --> 24:52.977
I don't think I have an extra money to you.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.340
I could do it to you.

24:56.021 --> 24:57.744
But I don't have one.

24:57.784 --> 25:00.128
I don't know whether they have any or not.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.329
But this is one copy.

25:01.349 --> 25:03.833
Why don't I just write it down and see if I can get a copy of it.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.161
It's called The First Hundred.

25:06.462 --> 25:10.045
They often have copies of it out there.

25:10.085 --> 25:20.715
What this is, is a bibliography of our first hundred publications in the Atlantic Research Center.

25:20.735 --> 25:23.838
It was done by Edwin T. Baum.

25:25.059 --> 25:25.539
Who's called it?

25:25.559 --> 25:33.887
The First Hundred Publications of the University of Texas A. Larson, Edwin T. Baum, D-L-W-T-E-N, D-E-E-N, D-E-N, D-E-N, D-E-N, D-E-N, D-E-N, D-E-N.

25:34.154 --> 25:37.578
Yeah, that was an old picture.

25:37.598 --> 25:40.641
It was in 1971, so I could be able to get a copy of that.

25:40.661 --> 25:42.823
Well, if they have them, they should have them.

25:42.843 --> 25:47.268
I don't know who else will have them if they don't, but ask them.

25:47.288 --> 25:49.610
That's a nice kid there, Dave Oliphant.

25:49.771 --> 25:50.892
Dave Oliphant, yeah.

25:51.272 --> 25:54.115
But anyway, this describes all of these first collections.

25:54.135 --> 26:00.762
And in the beginning, obviously, we were very inexperienced, and our first exhibition catalogs were pretty critical.

26:00.782 --> 26:03.385
But here's that first book.

26:03.685 --> 26:07.270
This was the one that, Kevin, I did when I was in B.B.

26:07.290 --> 26:13.219
I had gone to Florence and found some of these farms and stuff in Oriole's old bookshop.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.181
Remember Oriole Ann?

26:14.581 --> 26:15.883
I've not been there, no.

26:15.943 --> 26:23.655
Well, Oriole was the guy that published the Lugarno series, which was an Apocalypse.

26:24.316 --> 26:24.756
Oh, yeah.

26:24.776 --> 26:29.203
The translations appeared, and also he, I think he saw Lady Charities in the crowd.

26:29.504 --> 26:33.228
He was the private publisher of Lady Travel, he's lover, I believe.

26:33.248 --> 26:36.792
Yeah, well, a large publisher privately, himself, but he doesn't have .

26:36.812 --> 26:40.215
The Montgomery Board spying a paper label on the spine.

26:40.235 --> 26:41.076
Yeah, that's right.

26:41.096 --> 26:42.658
I have a very unusual copy of that book.

26:42.678 --> 26:43.419
Yeah, you do.

26:43.459 --> 26:43.779
Yeah.

26:44.019 --> 26:48.424
Well, it's unusual in that it has all the points of the first edition.

26:48.504 --> 26:49.505
It's a little smaller.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.346
It's not signed.

26:50.406 --> 26:55.111
And I think it was one of the 200 copies that he may have done for review purposes.

26:55.211 --> 26:57.013
I found it for 20 bucks in the store.

26:58.107 --> 27:00.253
Does it have a paper cover?

27:01.156 --> 27:06.351
No, it's like mulberry boards with a paper label on its spine.

27:07.153 --> 27:07.715
You think so?

27:09.982 --> 27:12.910
The quality of the paper is quite extreme.

27:13.868 --> 27:17.032
Well, even then, it's a nice item, even if it is a forgery.

27:17.092 --> 27:18.073
Well, let me see what I can do.

27:18.093 --> 27:19.174
But it is, I've seen it.

27:19.194 --> 27:26.083
A man named Gertzman has just concluded a bibliography of Lady Chattery's honor in which he's described every forgery.

27:26.163 --> 27:27.524
I can't find a darn thing.

27:27.645 --> 27:30.528
And it's here someplace.

27:30.548 --> 27:33.472
Here's my bibliography, if you want.

27:34.172 --> 27:34.533
Okay.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.475
I'll say about it in there.

27:36.495 --> 27:38.878
This is Cambridge, 50-year-old.

27:38.898 --> 27:41.561
Well, I don't know.

27:41.581 --> 27:42.222
It's a bibliography.

27:43.973 --> 27:57.850
I'm doing a lot of my archival research at Widener.

27:59.071 --> 28:01.434
Fortunately, they have just about everything.

28:01.494 --> 28:09.424
I don't know why I can't find things and put up here.

28:09.775 --> 28:10.656
Oh, not to worry.

28:10.736 --> 28:13.279
I'm sure they've been at Harvard and I'll check it out.

28:13.339 --> 28:14.881
Oh, period.

28:14.901 --> 28:15.662
Is this where this goes?

28:15.682 --> 28:16.483
Here it is.

28:16.503 --> 28:18.045
Yeah, here it is.

28:18.245 --> 28:19.426
He just finished it the other day.

28:19.446 --> 28:21.629
He sent me a copy of it.

28:21.709 --> 28:25.413
A lot of pleasure out of your books, I would say.

28:25.994 --> 28:27.776
Well, I'm cutting them down.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.299
I'm going into Texas stuff.

28:30.319 --> 28:32.562
That's what I really keep.

28:32.582 --> 28:36.266
And World War II and these other things.

28:36.386 --> 28:38.128
Most of this large stuff I'll get rid of.

28:39.509 --> 28:44.277
I'll give it to somebody who wants it.

28:45.419 --> 28:50.407
This is a beautiful working study, and I have to take note of it.

28:50.427 --> 28:51.088
Yeah, it is.

28:51.789 --> 28:52.130
It is.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.773
I've kind of made it.

28:54.894 --> 28:55.816
You've got a wine can.

28:57.258 --> 28:57.679
Four maps.

28:57.699 --> 29:01.205
You have one map that shows Texas being part of Colorado.

29:01.545 --> 29:03.188
Right.

29:04.180 --> 29:07.844
And another one that shows when the Republic of Texas was recognized by Great Britain.

29:07.964 --> 29:08.705
Really?

29:08.725 --> 29:09.486
Oh, that's nice.

29:12.329 --> 29:14.631
And then I love that one with California as the island.

29:14.651 --> 29:15.452
That's a famous map.

29:15.552 --> 29:16.814
Yeah, it's nice.

29:16.854 --> 29:18.495
And the history of mapping.

29:18.816 --> 29:19.817
Andreas gave me that.

29:20.177 --> 29:20.538
Really?

29:20.718 --> 29:20.898
Yeah.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.763
Is this Warren Roberts as a naval officer?

29:26.184 --> 29:26.424
Yes.

29:26.764 --> 29:28.706
I was a naval officer myself.

29:28.746 --> 29:29.327
Were you?

29:29.611 --> 29:30.132
Yes, sir.

29:30.652 --> 29:31.914
1968.

29:32.034 --> 29:34.998
I suspect that's what it was later.

29:35.018 --> 29:38.041
68 to 71, USS Ariskany, CVA-34.

29:38.342 --> 29:39.583
Ariskany, what is that, a carrier?

29:39.703 --> 29:41.245
A carrier, now retired.

29:41.506 --> 29:42.207
Was it a small carrier?

29:42.307 --> 29:45.290
It was an Essex class, an exact carrier.

29:45.310 --> 29:46.332
Were you the pilot?

29:46.672 --> 29:48.635
No, I was the public affairs officer, right?

29:49.235 --> 29:50.957
Ah, yeah, right.

29:50.977 --> 29:53.741
Then they won the argument, so I went back to the service.

29:53.861 --> 29:54.642
So what are we on here?

29:54.722 --> 29:56.124
This looks like a pretty good-sized ship.

29:56.144 --> 29:57.546
That's the commissioning of the ship.

29:57.586 --> 29:58.707
Looks like a cruiser, maybe.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.330
No, no, it's a DE.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.615
It had 11 officers and 200 men on it.

30:04.675 --> 30:05.576
Here it is.

30:05.596 --> 30:06.517
That's the real Navy.

30:06.678 --> 30:07.779
That's the Black Shoe Navy.

30:07.899 --> 30:08.380
Oh, God.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.183
It was a what Navy then?

30:10.223 --> 30:10.984
This is the ship.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.806
Douglas L. Howard.

30:13.287 --> 30:14.088
Taken from the U.S.

30:14.108 --> 30:17.753
Mission Bay, which is one of the small carriers.

30:17.773 --> 30:19.876
No, it was a diesel.

30:19.896 --> 30:21.759
It looks like two stacks.

30:22.039 --> 30:24.082
Well, it's just a pony stack.

30:25.043 --> 30:26.305
They had those pony stacks.

30:26.325 --> 30:26.946
I don't know why.

30:27.426 --> 30:27.867
No, you didn't.

30:28.049 --> 30:29.651
Yeah, just one, actually, I think.

30:29.691 --> 30:31.394
It just had one stack, and it was phony.

30:31.815 --> 30:34.419
I don't think there's another one.

30:34.439 --> 30:37.143
Yeah, one day, we did general quarters every morning.

30:37.163 --> 30:39.286
I don't know whether you still did that sort of thing.

30:39.366 --> 30:40.988
Not every day, thank God.

30:41.008 --> 30:47.398
Every morning, we had a day regular general quarters, and they had to test all the firing circuits.

30:47.418 --> 30:48.259
We had to do that?

30:48.279 --> 30:51.825
The guy forgot to take the, there's a torpedo mount here, right here.

30:51.905 --> 30:55.911
He forgot to take the primer, or whatever it was.

30:56.471 --> 30:57.533
And when he tested it,

30:57.850 --> 31:00.894
It shot it off and buried it about three seasons.

31:00.954 --> 31:02.035
God bless us.

31:02.616 --> 31:04.538
The only issue of air tarpeze is that.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.940
But of course it wasn't armed.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.943
It had to go through the water.

31:07.983 --> 31:09.965
I'm sure there were a lot of reports that had to be.

31:09.985 --> 31:12.268
I'll tell you that the people jumped off of that.

31:12.408 --> 31:14.451
Boy, it was like, man, I'll tell you for sure.

31:14.511 --> 31:16.674
And where is this?

31:16.734 --> 31:19.197
Well, that's my son.

31:21.460 --> 31:25.205
He's a chairman of the Department of Microbiology at Cornell.

31:25.225 --> 31:25.545
Really?

31:26.572 --> 31:27.333
That's right.

31:27.433 --> 31:33.342
All the English teacher's children become scientists.

31:33.362 --> 31:34.864
That's nice.

31:34.884 --> 31:38.229
Anyway, this is what I was showing.

31:38.249 --> 31:41.994
While I've got the machine, why don't you just tell me briefly what this collection of books is over here.

31:42.916 --> 31:47.682
Oh, those are the little Oxford Press blue books.

31:48.463 --> 31:52.289
And I buy the ones that were printed before the modern ones.

31:52.429 --> 31:53.431
They're not printed right now.

31:53.991 --> 31:55.093
These are earlier ones.

31:55.765 --> 31:59.389
But you like them as a collection-wide one?

31:59.409 --> 31:59.989
Yeah, right.

32:00.009 --> 32:01.691
I have control them first.

32:01.831 --> 32:06.696
I read all of them once every four or five years.

32:06.716 --> 32:13.242
But anyway, this is the Jonathan Cape Traveler Library, which goes all there down to here.

32:13.262 --> 32:15.745
I don't really have all of them yet.

32:15.765 --> 32:17.266
I used to buy them when I go to England.

32:17.406 --> 32:23.072
And this is a similar series used by it.

32:24.858 --> 32:30.824
Okay, so let's go back to, let's go back to this first.

32:30.844 --> 32:32.025
You always have something to read.

32:32.365 --> 32:34.928
Let's have this go back to this first hundred we were talking about.

32:34.948 --> 32:36.770
Oh, yeah.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.872
Anyway, see if you can get this.

32:38.892 --> 32:39.312
Beautiful.

32:39.593 --> 32:40.013
I'll try.

32:40.133 --> 32:43.557
Oh, he just did the most beautiful job of it and designed it.

32:43.617 --> 32:45.939
He designed this when he was already done.

32:45.959 --> 32:47.661
Put this piece of paper over here, Dr. Rose.

32:47.881 --> 32:48.722
Oh, that's my name.

32:48.802 --> 32:50.303
Okay.

32:50.323 --> 32:50.724
I'm Nick.

32:51.184 --> 32:52.165
This is the doctor.

32:52.313 --> 33:02.585
Is that a wood engraving that was pulled on this?

33:02.685 --> 33:03.025
No.

33:03.145 --> 33:03.966
No, it's not.

33:04.046 --> 33:07.631
No, this is an illustration for something that we picked up somewhere else.

33:07.651 --> 33:08.912
Frank Dolby used it.

33:08.972 --> 33:09.833
Do you know who Frank Dolby was?

33:09.853 --> 33:10.954
Oh, I saw his collection.

33:11.635 --> 33:12.877
Huh?

33:12.977 --> 33:15.239
The greatest Western writer who ever lived, I would say.

33:15.339 --> 33:16.861
Marvelous.

33:18.102 --> 33:18.683
He used that.

33:18.763 --> 33:22.067
I don't know where that came from, but we used it anyway, frequently.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.987
for anything having to do with Texas and Brooks.

33:29.054 --> 33:30.216
That was the first one.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.580
Yeah, that was the first one.

33:33.101 --> 33:45.081
And then the first exhibition we had, that I engineered myself, was this one, Hanley Library.

33:45.401 --> 33:46.724
Oh, you have to talk to me.

33:46.804 --> 33:48.747
Is there a catalog available there, I wonder?

33:50.397 --> 33:51.539
Prefaced by H.H.

33:51.559 --> 33:55.764
Ransom, compiled by Warren Roberts, 500 copies with limitation notice numbers.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.867
That would be a pretty rare book.

33:58.208 --> 33:58.408
Yeah.

33:59.169 --> 34:00.551
Turn it off for a second.

34:00.571 --> 34:00.811
Okay.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.415
I wouldn't say that.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.918
But I've got a copy of it.

34:07.701 --> 34:10.605
My writing was his corrections, because he didn't like some of the things I said.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.849
Anyway, that was the first one.

34:14.850 --> 34:18.936
And it was very...

34:19.675 --> 34:23.141
Listen, it was the first one, though.

34:23.962 --> 34:25.645
And, of course, that Hanley, that T.E.

34:25.705 --> 34:29.612
Hanley Library was, you know, that was something.

34:30.613 --> 34:33.498
November 17th, 19th.

34:33.558 --> 34:38.326
You've got to tell me a little bit about that.

34:38.427 --> 34:42.553
I used to go out to see Frida when she went along to New Mexico.

34:43.836 --> 34:45.278
And she said, well, they don't.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.436
I've been selling manuscripts for a long time to one collector.

34:49.456 --> 34:50.977
He said, well, that's nice.

34:50.997 --> 34:52.339
Who is that?

34:52.359 --> 34:53.780
Well, I'll have to.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.784
We'll have to have to find out if it's hard to tell you.

34:57.944 --> 34:59.966
So finally, they wrote the paper.

34:59.986 --> 35:01.548
He put a letter in and he said, here he is.

35:01.568 --> 35:01.888
Wow.

35:02.429 --> 35:03.229
You can write to him.

35:03.249 --> 35:04.090
He said, you can write to him.

35:04.110 --> 35:04.631
So I wrote to him.

35:05.171 --> 35:10.917
So he told me what manuscripts he had and what letters and stuff that I used when I was finishing the bibliography in Italy.

35:11.958 --> 35:12.419
Well, then.

35:12.459 --> 35:15.642
What is your reaction to this, being a Lawrence scholar?

35:15.662 --> 35:16.783
Oh, well, it was wonderful.

35:17.303 --> 35:20.507
And he had a lot of large stuff.

35:20.527 --> 35:24.593
I mean, this would be a swarant out of it, for example, in case one, down to here.

35:25.314 --> 35:28.018
It's rather nicely produced, that cattle, right?

35:28.038 --> 35:33.165
Well, it was all—they're all—they were designed at home, homemade, home-designed.

35:33.205 --> 35:34.286
The paper looks kind of nice.

35:34.426 --> 35:34.887
Well, it is.

35:34.947 --> 35:36.389
The Praying Division did pretty well.

35:37.611 --> 35:44.100
This is a Texas report by Whitman, in western Texas.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.483
But anyway—

35:46.717 --> 35:49.099
Case five, case three, these are the cases of the book.

35:49.119 --> 35:50.360
Yeah, the cases of the book.

35:50.380 --> 35:51.341
Now, this is all Lawrence.

35:51.741 --> 36:01.190
He had things like a beautiful early Lawrence manuscript with a story, a Russian officer, which is original.

36:01.210 --> 36:04.552
Early manuscript version of the rainbow, final manuscript version of the rainbow.

36:04.973 --> 36:07.075
I mean, God, the things he had are incredible.

36:07.095 --> 36:11.278
Now, this guy was a brick manufacturer, and Bradford comes away.

36:11.298 --> 36:11.699
You know that.

36:11.819 --> 36:12.199
I know that.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.021
Had an interesting wife, too.

36:14.181 --> 36:15.542
She's still alive, I understand.

36:16.012 --> 36:16.933
She is.

36:17.914 --> 36:22.078
I told you that she's really a character.

36:22.259 --> 36:34.412
Well, why did you think she was going to scratch the deal or something, or what?

36:34.532 --> 36:38.636
I said I had a correspondence with him for a long time.

36:39.117 --> 36:39.597
With Henley.

36:39.978 --> 36:41.379
Yeah, with Henley.

36:41.399 --> 36:44.162
And when I was in Italy,

36:45.104 --> 36:52.971
I told Ransom about it, and he got in touch with Jim Drake, and Jim Drake made the approach.

36:52.991 --> 36:57.435
Jim Drake was a member of the James Drake, the firm in New York.

36:57.515 --> 37:00.718
They were the carriage you built, Drake.

37:01.599 --> 37:04.501
Where did Eric Schwartz come into this?

37:04.521 --> 37:08.345
Jake Schwartz was the man who... Who sold the Hanley, I guess.

37:08.365 --> 37:09.286
Who sold the Hanley, right.

37:09.426 --> 37:15.111
I was going to tell you, if you know who Jake Schwartz is, he was the man at... The dentist.

37:15.614 --> 37:18.999
John Hayward called it.

37:19.019 --> 37:19.880
The plot thickens.

37:20.942 --> 37:25.128
John Hayward called it in the docu... What do you call it?

37:25.148 --> 37:33.900
The docu... Now he tried to get... Well, I don't want to break up the... His copy of his book, you know?

37:34.581 --> 37:35.823
I got him to describe it for me.

37:36.023 --> 37:37.105
Whose copy of whose book?

37:37.125 --> 37:38.467
Dick Schwartz's book.

37:38.487 --> 37:39.688
What's the title of his book?

37:39.789 --> 37:41.211
1100 Obscure Parts.

37:41.231 --> 37:44.355
1100... Is it published by a trade publisher?

37:44.875 --> 37:45.756
No, he did.

37:46.137 --> 37:47.960
It was Ulysses Bookshop.

37:48.100 --> 37:48.861
Okay.

37:49.161 --> 37:50.944
1100 obscure points.

37:50.964 --> 37:56.572
I think it was referred to by other books as 1100 obscene points.

37:56.592 --> 37:56.732
Uh-huh.

37:57.474 --> 38:03.663
By Dr. Jacob Schwartz, S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z, published by the Ulysses Bookshop, 2020.

38:03.763 --> 38:08.530
That's his bookshop, I think.

38:08.971 --> 38:09.211
Uh-huh.

38:09.231 --> 38:14.038
Well, anyway, he was the one that built Hannah's collection, and Schwartz was very shrewd.

38:14.474 --> 38:19.603
And, of course, rather merciless in getting these things out of people.

38:23.188 --> 38:24.130
But Hanley got in a fix.

38:24.170 --> 38:35.168
He lived in an old Victorian wooden house in Bradford, and the insurance people came to see him one time, and he had all these books and manuscripts, and he also had about $3 billion worth of French paintings and new things.

38:35.249 --> 38:39.756
And they said, you're going to have to get rid of either the paintings and the books, or your insurance is not going to work.

38:39.922 --> 38:43.186
I heard that, yeah, they had to keep them up in the garage and stuff, right?

38:43.206 --> 38:46.570
So he sold all the books, yeah.

38:46.591 --> 38:49.895
So it was really a thing with the insurance company?

38:49.915 --> 38:54.240
It's hard to fathom because... Well, it was in a fire trap.

38:54.260 --> 38:57.545
Yeah, but how does a person... That is a consideration of mine.

38:57.805 --> 38:59.006
We bought two.

38:59.026 --> 39:00.048
We bought two questions in.

39:00.068 --> 39:02.150
The first one, this was the first one.

39:02.170 --> 39:03.432
I bought the second one then.

39:05.555 --> 39:06.276
Was it a million dollars?

39:06.296 --> 39:07.057
Several years later.

39:07.117 --> 39:08.118
I've already made it.

39:08.138 --> 39:08.899
Is that about right?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.862
The first one, I don't think the first one was.

39:10.902 --> 39:12.264
The second one may have been.

39:12.284 --> 39:15.328
The price had gone up by then, and it could have been out there.

39:15.649 --> 39:16.350
Well worth it, certainly.

39:16.370 --> 39:17.832
I don't think the first one, though.

39:17.852 --> 39:18.032
Oh, God.

39:18.813 --> 39:20.756
I can't imagine the thing.

39:20.776 --> 39:27.465
I got back from Italy just before the collection of the little ship down here.

39:27.485 --> 39:28.987
So I was here when I got packed.

39:29.007 --> 39:30.269
I hope I'm packing.

39:30.289 --> 39:32.992
And you can't believe the things that came out of it.

39:33.012 --> 39:36.557
Tell me some of the things you felt coming from the collection of stuff.

39:37.904 --> 39:40.648
Well, let me see if I can remember.

39:40.668 --> 39:41.890
Oh, wait.

39:41.910 --> 39:44.373
I just put them over here, so you don't have to get a handy library.

39:44.393 --> 39:46.957
Let me see that.

39:46.977 --> 39:48.299
He didn't just have modern stuff.

39:48.319 --> 39:51.082
He had all that, of course, modern stuff, excitedness.

39:51.143 --> 39:54.467
And George Bernard Shaw, you know, he had about 4,000 or 5,000 letters.

39:56.130 --> 39:58.733
But some of the other things were really incredible.

39:58.994 --> 40:00.255
How long had he been collecting?

40:00.756 --> 40:01.337
I don't know.

40:01.477 --> 40:02.899
Did he love the stuff?

40:03.159 --> 40:04.541
What was your impression?

40:04.561 --> 40:07.185
He was really an unlettered person.

40:07.418 --> 40:08.960
But he was very canny.

40:09.962 --> 40:13.667
He had that instinct to buy what was good.

40:14.048 --> 40:15.309
Did you say lettered or unletered?

40:15.970 --> 40:16.771
Unletered.

40:17.893 --> 40:21.899
He had things like this.

40:22.279 --> 40:26.085
Oliver Carmel's proclamation, making himself chief magistrate of the country.

40:27.687 --> 40:33.335
In the Francis Bacon's advance from learning the first edition, his copy is one of four large paper copies known.

40:33.976 --> 40:37.341
I picked that thing out of that.

40:37.996 --> 40:39.317
when we were unpacking it.

40:40.459 --> 40:43.963
I mean, I don't think anybody even knew that he had the others.

40:44.103 --> 40:48.688
The title is Advancement of Learning, that's the full title, the first edition, 1605.

40:49.869 --> 40:53.053
This copy is one of four large paper copies known.

40:53.073 --> 40:55.736
It is in a magnificent state of the original.

40:55.836 --> 41:06.248
And look here, Isaac Newton, William Godwin, Thomas Hobbes of Isaac, Wealth of Nations, William Harvey's Circulation of Blood, Arden's Peace of the Charter.

41:06.683 --> 41:09.206
William Harvey's anatomical.

41:09.226 --> 41:11.408
John Hayden has his autographed signature on the flywheel.

41:11.428 --> 41:11.588
Yeah.

41:11.648 --> 41:12.289
On the Darwin.

41:12.309 --> 41:12.949
Yeah.

41:12.969 --> 41:14.771
And John Locke's essay on human understanding.

41:14.811 --> 41:17.274
I mean, it's just William Braxton's commentary.

41:17.294 --> 41:20.077
But look, as well as having, we're not just talking about a title.

41:20.097 --> 41:35.172
We're also saying this particular copy, we're talking about John Locke's essay on humane understanding, is the first issue as well, is the first issue as well, having the undated dedication to the Earl of Pembroke born in the 16th century.

41:35.422 --> 41:37.044
So we're not just talking about a rare book.

41:37.064 --> 41:40.148
We're talking about an association.

41:40.168 --> 41:44.614
That was one of the most exciting things that ever could happen, unpacking it.

41:44.894 --> 41:46.316
You didn't know the stuff was in there?

41:46.376 --> 41:48.839
No, we didn't know what was in there all over together.

41:48.899 --> 41:49.260
Who could?

41:50.622 --> 41:54.326
Jim Drake took a quick look at it and said, sorry to pay how much money for it.

41:54.346 --> 41:56.890
I think it was $200,000 or $300,000 maybe.

41:57.190 --> 41:58.071
This is the first one?

41:58.171 --> 41:59.853
Yeah, well below a million anyway.

42:00.374 --> 42:01.075
My God.

42:01.342 --> 42:04.025
You know, what that's worth now?

42:04.045 --> 42:04.846
Yeah, this is yours over here.

42:04.866 --> 42:06.248
What that's worth now?

42:07.550 --> 42:17.141
Well, if somebody from Scandinavia could pay two million dollars just for the holographic manuscript of Metamorphosis.

42:19.024 --> 42:19.564
Yeah.

42:19.764 --> 42:29.256
Well, the thing is, one of the arguments we used to use for this money, actually, when all was said and done, we didn't spend very much money for all this, you know.

42:29.624 --> 42:31.587
What, ten million, fifteen million dollars?

42:31.627 --> 42:32.027
Whatever.

42:32.168 --> 42:36.914
You know how much money they spend over there for scientific research without even thinking about it?

42:38.036 --> 42:38.997
Ten million, twenty million.

42:39.018 --> 42:41.040
As you say this, you're pointing towards the campus now, right?

42:41.060 --> 42:42.122
Yeah, right.

42:42.142 --> 42:49.052
I mean, and they'll spend five million dollars for something which is obsolete before they can get it operated.

42:50.073 --> 42:52.216
And everything we bought increased in value.

42:52.958 --> 42:54.520
And is unique.

42:55.021 --> 42:55.121
Yeah.

42:55.141 --> 42:59.547
And I have to say, over two days that we've spent in that facility,

42:59.611 --> 43:01.533
I am so impressed at the care.

43:02.353 --> 43:03.695
Yeah, it was very nice.

43:04.035 --> 43:06.657
I mean, it's state-of-the-art.

43:06.677 --> 43:07.158
It's wonderful.

43:07.398 --> 43:08.879
Yeah, we worked pretty hard on that.

43:08.899 --> 43:09.800
It's very impressive.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.402
After I retired, they put that conservation.

43:13.523 --> 43:16.586
It always happened, you know.

43:17.147 --> 43:28.757
The new people can demand what they want when they come in, but the old person is there and can't get money to, you know, enough money to keep the doors guarded.

43:29.412 --> 43:35.380
both of these people that have come in after me have been able to get a lot going.

43:35.640 --> 43:38.284
So now they're really on firm establishments.

43:38.304 --> 43:43.871
Well, I've spent, I've had two sessions with Tom Staley and he's quite an impressive guy.

43:44.312 --> 43:45.233
He's very good.

43:45.293 --> 43:46.435
He is excellent.

43:46.575 --> 43:48.097
I'm very glad they got him.

43:48.117 --> 43:49.078
He seems right.

43:49.119 --> 43:50.601
He's right, quite right.

43:50.641 --> 43:52.363
Deckard Turner maybe wasn't right.

43:52.383 --> 43:54.626
No, I'm afraid not.

43:55.487 --> 43:57.910
No, Tom Staley is, I think he's got everything.

43:57.930 --> 43:59.132
He's a book collector himself.

43:59.433 --> 44:01.275
He showed me his experience.

44:01.295 --> 44:02.537
He's a James Joyce person.

44:03.197 --> 44:18.896
I think it's well to have somebody whose main focus of researchers in the 20th century there, because there's too much 20th century stuff, and people who are interested in older periods of life have been undervalued 20th century materials, and he won't.

44:18.916 --> 44:21.199
So that's a plus.

44:21.759 --> 44:22.961
And he'll do a good job.

44:23.702 --> 44:29.068
You can't speak for him, and I asked him, and he said, I'll do what I have to do.

44:29.538 --> 44:39.292
Is it hard to follow Harry Ransom here, or does Harry Ransom cast a large shadow in the eyes of Texas?

44:39.352 --> 44:49.066
I'm not talking about the national or the international community, but is it hard to work, you know, where the man approaches icon stature, you know, whether justifiably or not?

44:50.588 --> 44:50.949
I wonder.

44:51.570 --> 44:52.491
What did he say to that?

44:53.399 --> 44:54.440
He really didn't.

44:55.101 --> 44:57.043
Well, he didn't really follow Harry Ransom.

44:57.063 --> 44:58.044
He followed the secretary.

44:58.064 --> 45:00.426
I understand, but that's right.

45:00.446 --> 45:02.048
I'm afraid the shadow was gone.

45:02.108 --> 45:04.510
Yeah, but Ransom still cast the shadow.

45:04.550 --> 45:05.891
I don't think it's Turner's shadow.

45:06.172 --> 45:16.001
Well, Ransom's a very complicated person.

45:16.021 --> 45:16.742
There are some books.

45:19.224 --> 45:19.845
Read about them.

45:20.973 --> 45:23.337
Well, the great libraries, the Hobson book, I know.

45:25.601 --> 45:28.426
The Awkward Embrace up there.

45:30.429 --> 45:42.310
The Awkward Embrace.

45:42.330 --> 45:46.457
There's a study that created arts in the institution of America.

45:46.657 --> 45:51.003
An inquiry based on interviews with nine men who have, through the organization, worked in North America.

45:51.143 --> 45:51.584
Oh, really?

45:52.385 --> 45:53.747
What of was Harry Ratzel?

45:53.767 --> 45:54.648
The Awkward Embrace.

45:54.668 --> 45:56.831
Now, this is by Knauss, no less.

45:56.851 --> 45:59.835
But when she came down, she didn't see anybody from Harry Ratzel.

46:00.637 --> 46:02.259
Joan Simpson Burns.

46:04.222 --> 46:06.204
It's titled The Awkward Embrace.

46:08.528 --> 46:15.357
And do you think that was maybe the creative artist in the institution in America?

46:15.377 --> 46:15.938
I don't know how many of us.

46:16.711 --> 46:17.772
No comment, huh?

46:18.233 --> 46:18.813
Here's a book.

46:19.714 --> 46:24.099
Our Invaded University's book on a desert.

46:25.281 --> 46:33.951
So what you're telling me is that if I read this book, you're not telling me this book, but you're... I'm telling you if you read that book, it's on your own, on your own.

46:33.971 --> 46:40.118
I'm not going to get... This is 75, too, a fairly recent book, isn't it?

46:40.518 --> 46:40.618
Yeah.

46:40.638 --> 46:45.884
And this is a book... Our Invaded University.

46:45.964 --> 46:46.465
Which is

46:49.499 --> 46:56.570
The development of theses that the industrial military complex has invaded our universities and taken over education.

46:57.492 --> 47:01.097
I think it's one-sided.

47:01.117 --> 47:07.407
But there's quite a bit about Branson in there, and I have no comment about that either.

47:07.548 --> 47:09.190
You're on your own.

47:09.310 --> 47:13.277
You read that.

47:13.377 --> 47:17.363
No comment positively or negatively, or just... No comment.

47:20.060 --> 47:23.484
Don't say that.

47:23.504 --> 47:27.630
In fact, I won't even mention that you mentioned the books.

47:27.650 --> 47:28.331
How's that?

47:33.037 --> 47:33.898
Can I just write it down?

47:37.242 --> 47:39.245
Let me just shut this up.

47:39.265 --> 47:43.290
All right, again, Dr. Roberts, we're talking about you could build a collection, not like the one.

47:43.370 --> 47:48.076
Many times, people have said over the past 20 years, well, you can't build another collection.

47:48.096 --> 47:49.037
The books are all gone.

47:49.726 --> 47:57.297
And I even said myself, with all the money in the world, you couldn't build a collection of people, Widener or Heineke.

47:57.397 --> 48:06.851
But things do keep coming up, and if you've got money and you're willing to spend it, you could put together a marvelous library.

48:07.431 --> 48:10.416
I wish somebody would give me a job doing it.

48:10.436 --> 48:13.480
Do you think $100 million has been spent in Texas?

48:13.500 --> 48:13.901
I don't know.

48:13.921 --> 48:14.642
Oh, in Texas?

48:14.662 --> 48:14.762
Here?

48:14.782 --> 48:14.882
Yeah.

48:14.902 --> 48:15.463
Oh, no, nothing.

48:15.865 --> 48:16.887
You mean for our library?

48:16.967 --> 48:18.449
Yeah, from beginning to end.

48:18.649 --> 48:18.870
No.

48:20.192 --> 48:22.756
This is important because I think this puts it in perspective.

48:23.097 --> 48:26.302
If it's as much as $20 million, I'd be very surprised.

48:26.322 --> 48:27.463
Oh, I think it's more than that.

48:28.525 --> 48:31.069
The New York Times in 73 said $45 million.

48:31.290 --> 48:31.931
Oh, they were wrong.

48:32.251 --> 48:33.032
They were wrong.

48:34.915 --> 48:36.598
So that's a problem that you have then, isn't it?

48:36.758 --> 48:38.040
The misperceptions.

48:38.421 --> 48:39.122
There is a myth.

48:39.254 --> 48:40.315
There's a myth, Russ.

48:40.456 --> 48:41.657
Maybe you could talk about that.

48:41.797 --> 48:43.900
Does that kind of tick you off every once in a while?

48:43.920 --> 48:44.261
Let's see.

48:44.281 --> 48:46.944
How much did this Perot stuff cost that he gave us?

48:46.964 --> 48:47.745
Sixteen million.

48:48.005 --> 48:48.166
Sixteen.

48:48.186 --> 48:50.529
But he didn't give you, you know, he loaned it, I found out.

48:50.549 --> 48:51.850
Yeah, oh, yeah, I know.

48:51.951 --> 48:53.072
The papers say he gave it.

48:53.092 --> 48:53.813
That's another myth.

48:53.833 --> 49:01.743
He mortgaged all of our... Yeah, we were reputed to be kept with lots of things.

49:01.763 --> 49:02.464
We spent money from him, too, yeah.

49:02.484 --> 49:05.388
I think we've mortgaged our future with that Perot stuff.

49:06.810 --> 49:07.551
That's a nice collection.

49:07.571 --> 49:08.492
That's sixteen million, isn't it?

49:08.512 --> 49:09.073
Yeah.

49:09.093 --> 49:09.193
Yeah.

49:09.477 --> 49:13.182
We were after them for years, you know.

49:13.362 --> 49:13.823
I had dinner.

49:13.863 --> 49:14.784
Alfred dropped with me.

49:14.804 --> 49:17.989
We'd have dinner.

49:18.009 --> 49:19.751
What happened?

49:19.851 --> 49:20.833
I think we just had a nice dinner.

49:21.273 --> 49:26.460
Alfred wanted to come down here.

49:27.422 --> 49:32.008
He had a nice little smile and jokes about it.

49:32.832 --> 49:35.095
And they gave me a copy of their book.

49:35.115 --> 49:39.040
You know, they kept all the Shelley stuff and all the romantic periods.

49:39.100 --> 49:39.581
They kept it.

49:40.903 --> 49:42.925
Which is really what we wanted, too, in the beginning.

49:44.007 --> 49:44.888
Do they still have that?

49:45.509 --> 49:48.633
Oh, they set it up somewhere in the foundation.

49:48.673 --> 49:49.354
This I don't know.

49:49.514 --> 49:50.035
I don't think so.

49:50.355 --> 49:52.118
I think so.

49:52.138 --> 49:52.358
Yeah.

49:52.478 --> 49:53.760
Well, at the Potsdamer Library.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.262
Where is the Potsdamer Library?

49:55.282 --> 49:55.823
I don't know.

49:56.043 --> 49:57.064
I'm going to find out now.

49:57.585 --> 50:00.950
It's in New York.

50:00.970 --> 50:01.270
No one.

50:01.773 --> 50:02.374
I'll find out.

50:02.394 --> 50:06.820
Don't worry about that, sir.

50:08.002 --> 50:09.444
But why did they sell so much stuff?

50:10.005 --> 50:11.207
Did they need the money, or what?

50:11.547 --> 50:12.388
Well, I don't know.

50:12.609 --> 50:15.973
If they had a library going, and their Gutenberg came down here, too.

50:17.716 --> 50:19.238
Were you involved in that, the Gutenberg?

50:19.919 --> 50:21.762
No, that was after I'd retired.

50:21.942 --> 50:22.903
What did you think of that?

50:22.963 --> 50:26.428
Well... I mean, they certainly didn't support the collection.

50:26.689 --> 50:27.510
Well, my...

50:27.895 --> 50:35.225
My theory has always been that money is only money, and you can't believe the way people spend money for other things.

50:35.245 --> 50:40.372
And so, I've never felt that any kind of money they wanted to spend from any work put in the library, they'd misspent.

50:42.074 --> 50:44.978
Bravo, you know, I feel that way myself.

50:46.059 --> 50:49.684
My wife and I left HRC yesterday, and we're walking.

50:50.457 --> 50:53.101
And I said, you know, I don't care what anybody says.

50:53.562 --> 50:55.344
This place is extraordinary.

50:55.705 --> 50:57.227
And it's here, and it's loved.

50:57.287 --> 50:58.128
It's not just here.

50:58.929 --> 51:02.434
Everything is so delicately and lovingly cared for.

51:02.895 --> 51:06.801
Because I've been to all the great libraries in the United States, except the Huntington.

51:06.821 --> 51:07.602
That's next.

51:07.622 --> 51:09.565
I'm going there in May of June.

51:09.985 --> 51:13.551
And that, I think, Huntington did in the early part of this century, which you guys did here.

51:13.571 --> 51:14.131
Yeah, right.

51:14.272 --> 51:14.772
Yes, right.

51:14.792 --> 51:15.854
He did exactly the same thing.

51:15.874 --> 51:17.236
He bought it, and he could buy it.

51:17.256 --> 51:17.937
On block.

51:17.957 --> 51:18.658
Yeah, you couldn't.

51:18.908 --> 51:21.011
Even when you get it, he couldn't buy it.

51:21.031 --> 51:21.992
He bought it, yeah.

51:22.273 --> 51:23.795
And he did it, and he didn't waste time.

51:24.796 --> 51:25.197
Right.

51:25.277 --> 51:27.941
And he really preferred buying on block.

51:28.121 --> 51:28.402
Right.

51:28.422 --> 51:29.263
Let's take the whole thing.

51:29.303 --> 51:31.186
Give me a price for the whole lot, and we'll take it.

51:31.606 --> 51:35.031
Now, he actually is a role model, I suppose, for this one.

51:35.532 --> 51:36.193
That's my guess.

51:36.293 --> 51:37.775
That's my feel.

51:37.795 --> 51:38.797
He could be, yeah.

51:39.858 --> 51:42.622
And that's one of the themes in my book, We Are Tracing Continuum.

51:43.243 --> 51:44.124
It is a continuum.

51:44.505 --> 51:45.546
Well, think how much money.

51:45.566 --> 51:47.189
You've seen this campus, haven't you?

51:47.209 --> 51:48.190
It's wonderful, yeah.

51:49.098 --> 51:53.444
Well, you haven't seen the medical research place in Houston, Indiana, it's an hospital.

51:53.884 --> 51:55.166
We've got one in San Antonio.

51:55.686 --> 52:05.419
You can't imagine how much money, how many millions of dollars have gone in building scientific research and other things.

52:07.001 --> 52:09.404
And what has gone into the humanities?

52:09.424 --> 52:11.106
Practically nothing.

52:11.287 --> 52:12.208
By comparison.

52:12.228 --> 52:13.249
By comparison, nothing.

52:14.714 --> 52:25.363
If everything that we spent from the time we first started until the time I retired, I don't think it would reach near to $20 million.

52:25.383 --> 52:26.824
That's conservative.

52:27.005 --> 52:28.386
So the Times was wrong, in other words.

52:28.986 --> 52:29.927
Flat wrong.

52:29.947 --> 52:32.609
Oh, the Times was completely wrong.

52:32.629 --> 52:33.190
That was 1971?

52:33.290 --> 52:35.232
January 1st, 1973.

52:36.032 --> 52:38.374
I'll send you a copy of that if you'd like.

52:38.615 --> 52:40.276
That's wrong.

52:40.436 --> 52:43.759
The occasion for that piece was the purchase of the Maximilian papers.

52:44.228 --> 52:47.033
Which the Times said was shrouded in mystery.

52:47.153 --> 52:49.718
How did Dr. Ransom find out about those letters?

52:49.979 --> 52:53.044
Well, Lou Feldman had them trying to sell them for years.

52:53.766 --> 52:55.469
I got that file yesterday.

52:55.529 --> 52:56.972
It's Lou Feldman who had them.

52:56.992 --> 52:58.034
That's exactly right.

52:58.134 --> 52:59.216
I used to go up and look at them.

52:59.236 --> 53:00.659
But why did nobody else know about them?

53:01.460 --> 53:02.683
Feldman wanted to become here.

53:02.743 --> 53:05.568
Feldman was building, helped build this collection.

53:05.608 --> 53:07.772
Feldman wanted to be known as the man who

53:08.140 --> 53:09.562
was behind the man.

53:09.902 --> 53:10.202
Really?

53:10.723 --> 53:12.165
And you think he was sincere about that?

53:12.185 --> 53:13.466
Oh, absolutely.

53:14.167 --> 53:17.611
You don't think it was the possibility of riches?

53:17.651 --> 53:18.692
No.

53:18.873 --> 53:21.275
He was already richer than he needed to be.

53:21.896 --> 53:23.097
God, he had money.

53:23.118 --> 53:23.898
I think you've got it.

53:24.559 --> 53:25.300
I think that's it.

53:25.320 --> 53:27.222
Oh, I can tell you that.

53:27.443 --> 53:29.245
He would have been the modern Rosenbach.

53:29.285 --> 53:32.428
Rosenbach who built Folger and Morgan and the others.

53:32.849 --> 53:33.810
Exactly.

53:34.297 --> 53:34.818
I know.

53:34.858 --> 53:37.500
I know how much money we spent.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.661
I had the spending out of it.

53:38.721 --> 53:40.363
I know the records.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.285
I know how much money went to Lou Thelma.

53:42.846 --> 53:43.226
How much?

53:43.746 --> 53:48.831
I don't know, but there is absolutely no way that he could have made the kind of money that he owned out of us.

53:49.112 --> 53:51.454
He was selling to other people all the time, too.

53:51.474 --> 53:51.915
It's true.

53:52.675 --> 54:03.426
But I think at least 85 percent of the stuff that we got from him came with him acting as a broker.

54:04.435 --> 54:12.465
Auction R. I found it and said, Lou, we want this.

54:12.485 --> 54:13.386
How'd you find things?

54:13.486 --> 54:15.549
Well, I found things all kinds of ways.

54:16.410 --> 54:20.415
I got a letter once in this, for example.

54:20.435 --> 54:22.818
This is most of my memoirs, too.

54:22.958 --> 54:26.823
I got a letter from a man at Louisiana State University.

54:26.843 --> 54:30.487
I believe it's Louisiana.

54:30.507 --> 54:32.450
He said, would you be interested in college?

54:33.351 --> 54:33.531
I'm like,

54:34.591 --> 54:34.931
Maybe.

54:35.913 --> 54:37.114
And I wrote back at you.

54:37.274 --> 54:38.115
Well, maybe I would.

54:39.357 --> 54:40.638
I didn't get any answers.

54:40.658 --> 54:41.079
I called.

54:42.240 --> 54:42.841
He wasn't there.

54:42.901 --> 54:43.542
He was going to Europe.

54:43.582 --> 54:44.563
Nobody knew where he was.

54:46.766 --> 54:47.847
Lou Feldman was in London.

54:47.867 --> 54:48.428
I called him.

54:48.488 --> 54:54.335
I said, Lou, somewhere in London there is a Coleridge collection for sale.

54:54.375 --> 54:55.496
He'd think you could find it.

54:55.516 --> 54:57.799
He called me four days later and he said, I bought it.

54:58.219 --> 54:58.600
Jesus.

55:00.101 --> 55:00.582
It was...

55:01.102 --> 55:08.149
Not very much of Simon Taylor, but it had every other Coleridge you ever lived, Hartley Coleridge the whole one.

55:08.169 --> 55:08.850
How did he find it?

55:09.190 --> 55:09.270
Huh?

55:09.550 --> 55:10.211
How did he find it?

55:10.491 --> 55:11.072
I got it.

55:11.092 --> 55:11.552
I don't know.

55:11.572 --> 55:13.794
He was just... So he had a network.

55:14.075 --> 55:15.696
Well, not a network, but he just wasn't.

55:15.816 --> 55:17.998
He probably lined up to Coleridge Ayers.

55:18.018 --> 55:19.580
It was one of the Coleridge Ayers that had it.

55:20.401 --> 55:20.981
Name Coleridge.

55:22.002 --> 55:22.463
He bought it.

55:22.483 --> 55:26.907
He said, I bought it, and if you don't want it, he said, I'll keep it myself.

55:27.443 --> 55:32.429
You know, Rosenbach used to say that to his clients, too, you know.

55:32.449 --> 55:34.692
Whatever his percentage was, he was charging that.

55:34.772 --> 55:41.560
I think he finally went up to 50%, because before he died, he went up to 10% most of the time.

55:41.580 --> 55:43.383
But that's the way he did.

55:43.403 --> 55:45.105
And, God, that was a marvelous thing.

55:45.125 --> 55:47.888
I mean, that's— What did it come in called what?

55:47.928 --> 55:53.555
What was the arch—did it come in as an archive with a name on it, or— Yeah, we just called it the College Project, I'm sure.

55:53.575 --> 55:54.556
We referred to it as that.

55:54.576 --> 55:55.898
I don't know what they call it now.

55:56.333 --> 55:57.335
That's a great story.

55:57.795 --> 56:00.720
So the Maximillian Letters you knew had been around for a while?

56:00.880 --> 56:01.541
Oh, yeah.

56:01.561 --> 56:02.863
I used to say about the news.

56:04.326 --> 56:05.067
He had a shot.

56:05.147 --> 56:08.532
It went for $125,000, which is not a lot of money, I guess.

56:08.953 --> 56:10.535
But so why did it take so long to get it?

56:11.337 --> 56:14.141
Well, we owed him money first.

56:14.582 --> 56:16.705
We didn't want to owe him any more money right there.

56:17.377 --> 56:23.182
Did he buy stuff for you and say, okay, you're going to have to pay this year, you can pay next year, out of next year's budget of the year after?

56:23.202 --> 56:30.809
Yeah, well, he usually would have a list of collections, and he'd send them down, and I'd go look at them.

56:30.829 --> 56:38.736
And we'd consider a ton of money coming in, and I'd go and grab some, and tell him, well, we should get those or we shouldn't.

56:38.756 --> 56:46.843
And then, he'd probably get it, and he would eventually end up getting most of the stuff, and he wouldn't have anything to do with what we wanted to do.

56:48.815 --> 56:51.700
No, there was things up there for a while.

56:51.740 --> 56:54.164
Was it the Hanley collection that really got you on your way?

56:54.644 --> 56:55.826
Yeah, that was the first one.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.269
That was really the first one.

56:57.289 --> 56:59.152
You really entered the big leagues with that one.

56:59.572 --> 57:02.257
Oh, that was just out of the world, yeah.

57:03.118 --> 57:05.702
And he had a second collection a few years later.

57:05.722 --> 57:07.926
Now, is that a stroke of luck that you guys get into that?

57:07.986 --> 57:09.048
You just heard about that?

57:09.328 --> 57:11.852
I did Frieda Lawrence, she told me.

57:12.743 --> 57:14.365
that she was selling manuscripts.

57:14.425 --> 57:20.191
Now, if somebody from Houghton had heard about it, maybe they would have, if they had, it was a question of being the first one there.

57:20.251 --> 57:20.451
Maybe so.

57:20.471 --> 57:22.453
He was completely unknown, as far as I know.

57:22.753 --> 57:25.096
But, I mean, it was a question of being the first one there.

57:25.616 --> 57:28.559
Well, it's a collection of being there, a question of being there at the right time.

57:28.619 --> 57:30.121
The first thing I'd find out is it was.

57:30.341 --> 57:31.282
Nobody knew he existed.

57:32.263 --> 57:34.826
And I had this long correspondence with him.

57:35.106 --> 57:38.970
I ran up a postcard line right here the other day.

57:39.878 --> 57:48.513
He was telling me that he had some more letters applied to Pinker.

57:48.533 --> 57:49.795
Did he love his stuff, Henley?

57:50.336 --> 57:51.158
Did he know his stuff?

57:52.260 --> 57:54.003
Or was he just an obsessive collector?

57:54.063 --> 57:56.788
I heard there were paintings all over the house, hanging in the bathroom.

57:56.828 --> 57:57.048
Oh, yes.

57:57.068 --> 57:58.811
Oh, you can't imagine the paintings he had.

57:59.052 --> 58:01.856
He was an accumulator.

58:02.157 --> 58:05.042
Oh, yes.

58:06.878 --> 58:14.869
I don't know whether there's, I don't suppose there's any pictures of that house or anything, but the walls are completely covered with Renoir, Matisse, Picasso.

58:15.469 --> 58:16.971
A lot of money in bricks, huh?

58:16.991 --> 58:21.437
Monet, Monet, Gauguin, you name it, they're there.

58:21.637 --> 58:22.439
I mean, I mean.

58:22.879 --> 58:25.042
I would say there's a lot of money in the brick business, I guess.

58:25.102 --> 58:36.217
And he was, he was happy to sell those books to us for that price because this proved to the rest of his family that he had to throw money away buying that stuff over his years instead of getting a brick.

58:36.277 --> 58:36.497
Yes.

58:37.355 --> 58:38.036
Did he say that?

58:38.656 --> 58:39.998
No, somebody told me that.

58:40.038 --> 58:40.719
I guess it was Jim Rake.

58:40.739 --> 58:41.439
Was he a nice guy?

58:41.459 --> 58:43.602
Jim Rake, maybe.

58:43.622 --> 58:44.803
He's a strange man.

58:44.823 --> 58:46.785
He had this unusual wife, to be sure.

58:46.825 --> 58:48.307
He wrote a book, a memoir.

58:48.907 --> 58:51.450
The Art of Love and the Love of Art, or something like that.

58:51.470 --> 58:53.532
The Art of Love and the Love of Art.

58:53.552 --> 58:58.157
And I'm told her motto was, I aspire to inspire before I expire.

58:58.638 --> 59:00.280
That's exactly what she said, yeah.

59:00.300 --> 59:03.543
That's the strange bird.

59:04.724 --> 59:06.366
She's still around, I'm told, you know.

59:07.088 --> 59:13.457
How am I doing?

59:14.979 --> 59:16.922
Do you like the sound of my book in any case?

59:17.042 --> 59:19.165
Oh, yeah.

59:19.545 --> 59:21.308
The first, really, it's going to be a good book.

59:21.508 --> 59:23.451
I'm not going to, you know, I want to tell the story.

59:23.571 --> 59:24.392
Let's put it that way.

59:25.053 --> 59:25.814
