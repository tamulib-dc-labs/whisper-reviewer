00:02.528 --> 00:04.231
So how did you feel to be?

00:05.053 --> 00:12.367
My last book, I believe, was your collective non-fiction, which was the occasion for our last talk.

00:12.407 --> 00:17.517
And now, tell me a little bit about this novel, how it

00:17.716 --> 00:19.518
if it's in the grand scheme.

00:19.838 --> 00:23.461
I'm also curious about your selection of the years, 84 and 1912.

00:23.501 --> 00:33.150
Is it your research that kind of moves you towards picking these years, or are these essential years in the cycle of your characters?

00:33.350 --> 00:34.271
Well, that's what happens.

00:34.331 --> 00:41.077
These people lived their lives in these years, and I'm stuck with them.

00:43.639 --> 00:47.082
This book I started to write in...

00:48.175 --> 00:48.857
1976.

00:49.478 --> 00:51.142
Wow.

00:51.282 --> 01:01.345
And I have a note to myself about writing a novel that's a flaming corset.

01:01.506 --> 01:02.488
And in 1976,

01:02.755 --> 01:09.927
I think I finished Billy Phelan.

01:10.247 --> 01:27.295
Billy Phelan has now become like the crucible for the whole cycle.

01:27.848 --> 01:34.096
Remind me to go back to another book called An Albany Trio, which you may not have seen yet.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.818
I don't think anybody has seen this book.

01:35.838 --> 01:37.260
This is a well-kept secret.

01:37.280 --> 01:43.588
They were supposed to have it out with... I haven't seen it in any bookstore yet.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.090
Is this Viking snowing?

01:45.110 --> 01:46.512
England.

01:46.532 --> 01:47.634
There's a paperback?

01:47.674 --> 01:51.679
It's legs building an ironweed in one volume.

01:52.064 --> 01:56.752
plus a new intro by me called Prelude in a Saloon.

01:57.172 --> 01:58.835
I had to get that then.

01:58.855 --> 02:04.825
And call Meg Linehan, and she'll get an hold of it for you.

02:04.845 --> 02:06.387
She'll fax it, I'll get it up to you.

02:06.407 --> 02:07.028
She could fax you.

02:07.068 --> 02:08.250
All you really need is the...

02:08.534 --> 02:09.355
the prelude.

02:09.375 --> 02:12.279
Yeah, sure, but, you know, she'll take care of it.

02:12.299 --> 02:17.045
But if you're going to write this, because this is how the cycle came to be, you know.

02:17.065 --> 02:23.873
And in this, I make Danny Quinn the author of the Albany Cycle.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.155
You got that?

02:25.175 --> 02:28.198
Danny Quinn is Francis Phelan's grandson.

02:29.079 --> 02:34.506
He's George Quinn and Peg Phelan's son.

02:34.526 --> 02:37.350
He's ten years old and Iron Week.

02:37.370 --> 02:37.630
And, um,

02:38.200 --> 02:44.797
He grows up and goes into the army and he's a pal of Corse and Purcell in Ferialbone.

02:45.218 --> 02:48.526
They're in the army together in Germany.

02:48.546 --> 02:53.258
And he marries a Cuban girl at the end of Ferialbone.

02:53.278 --> 02:55.163
He's also the grandson of

02:55.835 --> 02:58.901
Daniel Quinn of Quinsburg.

02:58.921 --> 03:08.520
So anyway, he has written this cycle, and this is a story of how these various books came to pass.

03:08.620 --> 03:16.476
And in this story, he's interviewing a gangster, and the interview has been set up by Billy Phelan, who's also

03:16.709 --> 03:18.732
They're in the saloon, owned by the gangster.

03:18.752 --> 03:22.338
They used to hang out with Mike Steinle, and they're talking about Mike Steinle.

03:24.241 --> 03:37.401
And in the course of the talk, Billy becomes prominent in the conversation, and it occurs to Danny Quinn that...

03:37.617 --> 03:39.900
Billy needs his own book.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.484
Billy needs his own book, so he has to write Billy Phelan.

03:44.104 --> 03:59.642
And then he writes Billy Phelan, and in the course of that, he goes back to a previous book that he wrote, and he quotes the passage from a character in that first book, which is...

04:00.415 --> 04:09.186
about Francis failing before Francis was married or anything, and he quotes this little moment of vignette.

04:09.427 --> 04:15.134
And then Francis becomes eminent in Billy's book and demands his own book.

04:15.795 --> 04:19.760
So one book begets the other, and he comes back to it.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.803
It's all told as a short story.

04:22.023 --> 04:24.887
It's a piece of fiction, but it's also an essay.

04:25.222 --> 04:28.486
on how this cycle came to pass.

04:28.506 --> 04:32.551
You can get Meg to fax it to you this afternoon.

04:33.392 --> 04:34.974
She can overnight it, actually.

04:34.994 --> 04:39.720
It'll take me a while to transcribe this tape, anyway.

04:40.381 --> 04:53.237
Anyway, this book I started as soon as I finished Billy Phelan, and I meant to write a complete novel

04:53.960 --> 05:23.899
called the flaming corsage and also the play which would be a three or four act play i didn't know the play is the play that we have at the at the back that edward doherty writes right and i was going to write the whole play and have the play and the novel in the same value the play would be kind of a coda it would be a parallel element but you know they would work together oh it is kind of a coda sure it is it is but it's in quite a different way you know

05:24.689 --> 05:25.891
to write a whole play.

05:25.991 --> 05:29.496
It would be ambitious beyond my capacity in those days.

05:29.516 --> 05:32.560
Except you are staging a play, I think we should point out, aren't you?

05:32.580 --> 05:33.341
Yes.

05:33.381 --> 05:40.291
The play is closed on June 9th, last Sunday.

05:41.834 --> 05:42.715
They had the dates around.

05:42.735 --> 05:44.377
I thought it was just opening in July.

05:44.658 --> 05:45.239
No, no, no.

05:45.319 --> 05:53.551
It opened May 8th and closed... It was supposed to close June 2nd, and it was such a hit, they extended it a week.

05:53.711 --> 05:54.612
Oh, that's...

05:54.811 --> 05:58.396
And they may bring it back for two more weeks in September.

05:58.536 --> 05:59.157
Did they print?

05:59.377 --> 06:01.901
Did they publish the... No.

06:01.921 --> 06:02.081
No.

06:02.221 --> 06:03.523
It's a work in progress.

06:04.004 --> 06:05.666
And I'm still fiddling with it.

06:05.846 --> 06:13.156
And I think it'll be a long time before anything gets set in stone.

06:14.298 --> 06:18.363
Is it the kind of thing that you hope to bring it down to... It's got a shot.

06:18.824 --> 06:20.746
Down to the Big Apple?

06:22.008 --> 06:22.509
I don't know.

06:22.909 --> 06:23.350
Maybe.

06:24.325 --> 06:28.230
A lot of people are asking to see copies of it.

06:28.250 --> 06:33.956
It's a little early to get the reaction.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.818
How about the skills as a fiction writer, though?

06:35.838 --> 06:39.002
I mean, do you have to think differently as a playwright?

06:39.763 --> 06:40.023
Very.

06:41.966 --> 06:45.730
This is really the second play I've done.

06:45.750 --> 06:46.671
The first play.

06:47.393 --> 06:57.686
It's taken from a novel I wrote, Very Old Bones, and it's still in process.

06:58.307 --> 07:05.195
I haven't finished that.

07:05.296 --> 07:14.447
As soon as I get home, that'll be my next creative project.

07:14.680 --> 07:22.494
to put that into a final form and get it into a workshop situation in Albany.

07:22.514 --> 07:24.818
At this stage, I'm calling it The Sparrows.

07:24.898 --> 07:25.579
That's all it is.

07:25.860 --> 07:28.604
I don't know what the title will be, but it might be that.

07:33.633 --> 07:39.203
The other play is called Grand View, and it's a political play.

07:39.892 --> 07:43.737
And it's really part of the cycle of novels and stories.

07:43.797 --> 07:50.066
I mean, it's no longer a cycle of novels because now I've got a play in the middle.

07:50.166 --> 08:05.266
And the play is about Patsy McCall, the political boss, who is a character very much so in Billy Phelan, and who I have a full novel that I'm going to write a long book about one of these days.

08:05.286 --> 08:06.327
Can I get you in the glass of wine?

08:06.347 --> 08:06.928
Yes, please.

08:07.752 --> 08:15.424
And it's 1944.

08:15.484 --> 08:19.590
Dewey is the governor, although he's never named, it's just the governor.

08:20.832 --> 08:26.320
And he's trying to break the political machine in Albany in order to enhance his reputation.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.506
And he's running for president against FDR.

08:30.526 --> 08:32.469
And it's Labor Day.

08:32.670 --> 08:32.950
And...

08:33.790 --> 08:42.200
It's a closed down summer hotel in Saratoga called the Grandview Lake House, which comes out of very old bones.

08:46.105 --> 08:56.457
It's a conflict between the governor and the political boss through an emissary who used to know the political boss 20 years ago.

08:57.263 --> 09:01.971
The emissary also brings his wife, who used to be the boss's old girlfriend.

09:01.991 --> 09:06.819
So you have a love triangle, and you have a political war all wrapped up together.

09:06.879 --> 09:15.694
Do you see the writing of the plays as an artistic challenge, or is it just whether it's... Oh, very much so.

09:15.674 --> 09:18.377
Yeah, it's definitely an artistic challenge.

09:18.397 --> 09:20.518
It's a totally different form.

09:21.820 --> 09:28.826
I mean, it's... I'm wondering what's driving you to move in that direction where clearly you're so firmly established as a novelist?

09:30.968 --> 09:34.692
Well, it was... It's twofold.

09:37.574 --> 09:43.740
The primary purpose... I do believe was...

09:44.497 --> 09:56.073
An unconscious one was to make myself equal to Edward Doherty in order to invent him.

09:56.874 --> 10:01.862
You're getting these great lines.

10:01.882 --> 10:04.926
I'm sorry.

10:04.946 --> 10:09.412
I can see these things in quotations.

10:10.033 --> 10:13.558
I was intimidated by the idea of writing that

10:14.180 --> 10:17.264
three or four-act play back in the 1970s.

10:17.645 --> 10:28.640
And I just kept reading about theatre and turn-of-the-century theatre and grounding myself in it.

10:28.940 --> 10:37.572
And eventually somebody came to me from the local theatre in Albany and said,

10:38.159 --> 10:43.746
we want to stage Billy Phelan, we want to stage legs, we want to stage iron, we don't want to stage anything you want to do.

10:43.826 --> 10:46.429
I said, no, no, no, no, no.

10:47.971 --> 10:54.158
And I had nothing to give you, and I'm not going to write a poem.

10:54.178 --> 11:03.289
So then Norman Mailer came up to an event in Albany at the Writers Institute, which I run, at the University at Albany.

11:03.944 --> 11:14.321
We had a, about four years ago, 1992 I think it was, we had a thing called Telling the Truth.

11:15.784 --> 11:20.292
And it was a state of the art of non-fiction.

11:20.312 --> 11:27.724
And we had 35 or 37 major American non-fiction writers and a few select novelists.

11:28.261 --> 11:36.331
who also dealt with non-fiction like Mailer and Mary Gordon and myself.

11:36.351 --> 11:39.615
And the three of us were on a panel together.

11:39.695 --> 11:42.378
But Mailer at that point was the president of Penn.

11:43.440 --> 11:52.851
And he wanted to put on some kind of a fundraiser for Penn with a...

11:53.287 --> 11:57.652
a group of plays by novelists.

11:57.672 --> 12:01.497
And he asked me, did I have anything?

12:01.617 --> 12:12.370
And he had to ask Doctorow, and Styron, and Joe Heller, and Susan Sontag, and himself, and a bunch of other people.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.352
It never came to pass.

12:14.532 --> 12:16.134
They never used anything.

12:16.935 --> 12:19.378
But I did write a play.

12:19.398 --> 12:22.602
And it was called, it was a one-act play.

12:22.852 --> 12:30.042
It's called Dinner at the Phelan's, and it was right out of very old Barnes.

12:31.363 --> 12:47.144
And Mailer liked it very much and gave it to Frank Corsero, who was then sort of the artistic director at the Actors Studio, the Actors Workshop, whatever it was.

12:47.164 --> 12:49.247
And he loved it.

12:49.987 --> 12:54.511
And they encouraged me to make it into a full-length play, which I did.

12:56.232 --> 13:02.318
And they wanted to do it at the Active Studio, develop it.

13:02.358 --> 13:06.762
And so I wrote it again, and then I wrote it again.

13:07.262 --> 13:10.045
And the more I wrote it, the more they loved it.

13:11.786 --> 13:14.228
Except it still wasn't quite working.

13:14.268 --> 13:16.210
It was still novelistic.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.673
And I was still learning how to...

13:19.855 --> 13:35.376
You know, to organize the unities of time and place and characters and not have 45 characters running around in different time periods.

13:35.396 --> 13:38.921
But I think that you as a novelist really are aware.

13:39.021 --> 13:42.245
I mean, alert more than most to the unities, I think.

13:42.265 --> 13:49.575
Well, in a sense, I've learned a great deal from the theater and from the movies all my life.

13:49.960 --> 13:59.214
And the sense of confusion, especially in this book, and the use of dialogue has been part of my kit bag.

14:01.358 --> 14:06.866
But it's still a very different art form.

14:08.489 --> 14:17.082
And I've got a lot of work cut out for me to get this thing called the Sparrows into...

14:17.534 --> 14:35.391
serious shape as a play do you have to see it performed it helps enormously i mean this play grand view i i uh it began as a collaboration collaborator fell by the wayside and i carried on all by myself

14:35.877 --> 15:02.070
and in January we had a stage reading of my draft and it was good but it was flawed seriously by a couple of gaping flaws and we all knew it but then it had to be fixed so I went back and I rewrote it and

15:02.624 --> 15:13.083
Then we did some rehearsals and I kept rewriting constantly and constantly, you know, right up until three days before opening night.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.946
I mean, I was driving the actors crazy.

15:14.966 --> 15:20.156
I one day gave them 60 new pages out of an 82-page draft.

15:20.557 --> 15:20.757
Wow.

15:21.558 --> 15:23.502
And, you know, there were all changes in

15:23.836 --> 15:27.580
staging directions, dialogue cut, everything, you know.

15:27.741 --> 15:29.723
I mean, were you kind of directing it?

15:29.783 --> 15:30.824
No, no, no, no.

15:30.844 --> 15:32.466
I have no idea about directing.

15:32.506 --> 15:33.647
I would never do that.

15:35.069 --> 15:51.328
But I'm very close with the director, who is Maggie Mancinelli Cahill, who is the artistic director of the...

15:51.697 --> 15:58.907
Capital Repertoires here.

15:58.927 --> 16:09.042
Why don't you go ahead and have a bite?

16:09.062 --> 16:12.948
Maggie Mancinelli Cahill.

16:13.609 --> 16:15.932
M-A-N-C-I-N-E-L-L-I Cahill.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.657
C-A-H-I-L-L.

16:18.919 --> 16:26.871
She's out of New York, and she has just become the new artistic director of Cap Rep, Capital Repertory Theater in Albany.

16:27.652 --> 16:29.335
Not so soon, sir.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.199
I know that.

16:32.219 --> 16:33.381
And...

16:34.103 --> 16:47.625
She directed the piece, and I learned an enormous amount.

16:50.230 --> 16:56.500
You know, I had never gone through this process at all.

16:57.087 --> 17:17.775
This is my allergy season, too, I have to say.

17:18.436 --> 17:22.842
I take pills every day.

17:23.598 --> 17:29.405
So anyway, this came along, and I couldn't resist it.

17:29.865 --> 17:38.215
It was just they got a grant to do it, and it seemed ideal to try.

17:38.255 --> 17:51.090
And I had a kind of a ready-made story of this political boss that I wanted to use, and I'd for years been thinking about doing a...

17:51.745 --> 17:54.809
a story at a summer hotel after Labor Day.

17:55.610 --> 17:57.031
So I had the setting as well.

17:57.492 --> 17:58.433
And I had the hotel.

17:59.895 --> 18:03.899
And it just worked.

18:03.979 --> 18:07.063
And I was very happy with how it all came out.

18:07.143 --> 18:11.488
And I love the process.

18:11.628 --> 18:13.531
And I'm not afraid of it anymore.

18:13.591 --> 18:16.594
And I want to do it again.

18:18.096 --> 18:21.600
Because I got another one that's sort of ready to go.

18:22.070 --> 18:31.183
It helps, certainly, that you're in an area where they're not only able to stage them, but willing and delighted to do it.

18:31.203 --> 18:32.885
And you have a very good company.

18:32.905 --> 18:38.713
And that's enviable, because I would say the hardest thing in the world, even more than getting a first novel published, is to get a play stage.

18:38.934 --> 18:42.539
I can't imagine why anyone would want to be a playwright today.

18:43.260 --> 18:48.347
You think of how almost impossible it is, I mean, for a young writer emerging...

18:48.800 --> 18:52.907
I mean, I did an interview with Albert Albert, and I said, what do you tell people?

18:52.967 --> 18:55.351
And they said they want to be young people, and they want to be playwrights.

18:55.371 --> 19:00.319
He said, first of all, he said, I tell them to do it only if they can't live without doing it.

19:00.339 --> 19:05.869
And he said, and then, if that's the way you feel, then I'll give you the wisdom of my ears.

19:06.830 --> 19:11.819
He certainly doesn't advise it, because staging... He doesn't advise it at all.

19:12.039 --> 19:12.580
That's right.

19:12.813 --> 19:16.119
Well, let's get back to that.

19:16.199 --> 19:22.169
We aren't going to talk much about the novel because that's my job, you know, to read it, of course.

19:22.189 --> 19:29.381
Well, to telling you about the basic origin of the novel is the key to this.

19:29.401 --> 19:36.232
And so, you know, I kept wanting to do it over a period of like 20 years.

19:36.433 --> 19:37.234
I mean...

19:37.383 --> 19:40.790
But the conception of it, let me interrupt, actually precedes Iron Weed?

19:41.391 --> 19:41.531
Yes.

19:42.113 --> 19:45.239
When I couldn't write this, I wrote Iron Weed instead.

19:47.143 --> 19:49.046
That was my next book after Billy Phelan.

19:49.447 --> 19:55.780
As soon as I was finished with Billy Phelan, I started to write this, and I spent like a summer...

19:56.131 --> 20:22.037
trying to to make it work and i never did what was the difficulty in this artistically well i didn't know what was really going on in the love nest for instance i didn't know who those people were i had some ideas about them but i i really didn't know uh what happened in the love nest it was it was a mystery to me and um

20:22.439 --> 20:25.743
It was a mystery because really everybody was lying.

20:26.904 --> 20:30.848
And they were lying to me as well as they were lying to one another.

20:31.189 --> 20:44.804
And it took me many, many thrusts and parries and so on to arrive at the conclusion of who was in there and what they were doing there.

20:44.824 --> 20:46.185
And then it was a

20:46.385 --> 20:52.555
It was an engineering problem to construct the plot.

20:53.336 --> 21:00.668
You said it was an engineering problem.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.815
And it became a mystery story.

21:04.835 --> 21:06.958
And I didn't realize that that's what I was writing.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.943
Is this your first mystery story?

21:09.983 --> 21:10.063
Yes.

21:11.427 --> 21:13.489
It's the first one I'd finished.

21:17.613 --> 21:22.077
Back in 79 or 80, I started to write a thriller.

21:26.781 --> 21:28.143
I got about 100 pages in.

21:29.464 --> 21:31.706
And what was the motivation for that?

21:33.307 --> 21:33.788
Make money.

21:35.730 --> 21:38.312
At the same time, I...

21:38.680 --> 21:42.704
I became a screenwriter, and I made some money in doing that.

21:42.724 --> 21:44.806
I didn't make any money on the thriller.

21:44.826 --> 21:51.312
Because the thriller, I got 80, 90 pages in it, and it was turning into a comedy.

21:51.333 --> 21:59.020
I couldn't take the thriller genre seriously, and I didn't know how to.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.842
I got into a Damon Runyon mode.

22:00.962 --> 22:04.405
Everybody was cracking jokes all the way around.

22:04.506 --> 22:05.707
I don't know if you know Richard Yates.

22:05.947 --> 22:06.788
Do you remember Richard Yates?

22:06.808 --> 22:08.029
I do, yeah.

22:08.296 --> 22:36.177
wonderful writer remember him saying he tried mindfully once to try and write a commercial bestseller he said God if I knew how to do this I'd do it and he said it always would turn out to be a farce you know he couldn't you know inevitably return to what you do and I guess all these stories I mean do you think all these stories are there and they're waiting for you to go in and chronicle them or is it like

22:36.646 --> 22:42.134
Michelangelo, who says that the sculpture is beneath the marble, I think... Yeah, all you have to do is cut away the excess.

22:42.154 --> 22:44.037
Cut away the excess.

22:44.057 --> 22:46.260
Well, you cut away a lot of excess in this novel.

22:46.280 --> 22:51.248
That's one of the things that you wanted to do is make it a very tight... Right, sure.

22:51.268 --> 22:55.314
...very intentional.

22:55.334 --> 23:02.364
Well, I have a... You have a sense of certain... A sense of the characters.

23:03.646 --> 23:04.948
But their stories as well?

23:05.772 --> 23:10.920
The stories develop.

23:11.340 --> 23:15.547
There's usually a situation, not a story.

23:23.579 --> 23:30.750
The novel I'm planning to write, not necessarily next, but about the political boss...

23:32.384 --> 23:56.569
is the establishment of the party 1919 1921 and i'll take that i hope through 1931 or 32 32 probably which will give it the first decade of the party's existence i have no idea whether i'll really do that but that's that's the impetus i have that

23:56.802 --> 24:00.766
have the 20s to deal with in a different way from the legs.

24:00.906 --> 24:06.932
But this story or these stories, they certainly do figure when you're writing other stories.

24:06.952 --> 24:09.414
I mean, because you kind of make references.

24:11.156 --> 24:11.396
Right.

24:11.856 --> 24:14.078
They all intermesh now, you know.

24:15.960 --> 24:26.370
They have their own integrity, but there's also a kind of...

24:27.785 --> 24:36.919
world that they are operating within, and I have to be cognizant of that.

24:36.959 --> 24:46.333
You know, I have to be... You know, when I wrote this play about Passive McCall, Grand View,

24:47.242 --> 24:48.945
I felt like I was stealing from my novel.

24:50.307 --> 24:52.130
Because I'm giving so much.

24:54.454 --> 24:56.457
In a sense I am, but in a sense I'm not.

24:56.617 --> 25:02.667
In a sense that this is 1944, he's another creature now.

25:02.687 --> 25:08.596
What he was in 1921 to 1932 is not clear at all to me.

25:10.720 --> 25:14.025
I don't know what I want to do with that novel.

25:14.512 --> 25:16.414
But I know he's there.

25:16.754 --> 25:17.915
I know a lot of people are there.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.521
I got some great politics.

25:23.541 --> 25:25.683
I got so much stuff.

25:26.644 --> 25:28.025
Are you still doing tremendous research?

25:28.926 --> 25:31.068
I've done the research on that one.

25:31.088 --> 25:36.773
I mean, all I'm going to do now is figure it out.

25:37.374 --> 25:39.616
The research comes when it's necessary.

25:39.636 --> 25:40.637
You know, like...

25:40.921 --> 25:44.866
I had to research the Delavan fire in this one.

25:45.728 --> 25:49.112
I had to research that fight on the barge.

25:49.172 --> 25:52.357
I knew about both of them years and years ago.

25:53.919 --> 26:03.112
But I knew there was some kind of coverage that must have been on the barge fight, because it was such a horrendous event.

26:03.232 --> 26:07.738
It was based in the real 1912 event.

26:08.326 --> 26:09.528
And eventually I found it.

26:10.470 --> 26:13.576
But, you know, it added something.

26:14.097 --> 26:17.703
I could have done without it, without the research.

26:19.026 --> 26:21.250
That's not the way you work.

26:21.330 --> 26:25.718
No, I like to do the... Well, the real stuff is so often better.

26:25.738 --> 26:26.579
Anything you can make up.

26:27.201 --> 26:31.789
It's really so wild and so funny sometimes.

26:31.809 --> 26:32.270
Crazy.

26:32.290 --> 26:32.410
Crazy.

26:33.217 --> 26:42.829
This is pretty good when you get rid of the peppers.

26:43.070 --> 26:47.075
Let's talk a little bit, obviously, about the themes in this novel.

26:47.095 --> 26:55.966
I'm amazed that you would have had an Irish Catholic marrying a Protestant girl at that particular point.

26:57.368 --> 27:02.194
Well, that was part of the discovery, you know.

27:02.410 --> 27:17.086
I knew she was... I invented this whole thing like that when I was writing Billy Phelan, because I don't know where the invention came from.

27:17.106 --> 27:20.669
But it was all there in Billy Phelan.

27:20.689 --> 27:26.055
The mixed marriage, the Loveness scandal, the killings, the writing of the play.

27:26.356 --> 27:34.408
the closing of the play, the death of Katrina, the fire that destroyed all his papers.

27:35.110 --> 27:35.851
You knew all that.

27:36.592 --> 27:38.835
You go back and look at Billy Fallon, you'll see it.

27:38.855 --> 27:39.616
It's all there.

27:39.837 --> 27:40.578
Everything was there.

27:41.399 --> 27:44.524
But, you know, it's an outline of facts.

27:44.544 --> 27:53.578
It's like having a passersby sketch of an individual.

27:53.727 --> 28:19.482
the scene of a crime, you know, like that guy in Royster last week, took a pen sketch of him, and it sort of looked like him in one of the sketches, but that's very remote from what the full human being is, you know, but that's what you discover, you start with those outlines of an individual, of a situation, and

28:19.917 --> 28:22.002
It just grows.

28:22.022 --> 28:23.586
You talk to yourself about it.

28:25.470 --> 28:28.958
The complications are there to be solved.

28:29.820 --> 28:33.268
The more complications are solved, the more there were to be solved.

28:33.890 --> 28:39.095
the various motivations of the people, how to get them to do it, who did it, and why did they do it.

28:39.356 --> 28:40.637
And it's so compact, though.

28:40.657 --> 28:43.340
I mean, you did this with a great deal of economy.

28:45.782 --> 28:53.730
Well, that was willfully... The form was something I wanted to do all my life, which was to do this.

28:53.750 --> 28:57.274
A book in fragments and jumps.

28:57.294 --> 29:03.660
It was... You know, if I was to write this as a...

29:04.282 --> 29:07.926
coherent saga, the thing would be two miles long.

29:08.727 --> 29:17.597
And I would die before I got to chapter six.

29:17.617 --> 29:28.770
So I really wanted to do these jump cuts, this kind of fragmenting of the story in order to

29:29.189 --> 29:36.220
is there such a word, ellipticize?

29:37.462 --> 29:44.433
To ellipticize the narrative for the sake of the reader and make the reader work.

29:45.876 --> 29:51.805
One of the things that

29:52.021 --> 30:01.255
I've heard about, you know, a couple of reviewers who said that this seems too short.

30:01.335 --> 30:07.084
These are readers who demand expansiveness or something like that.

30:07.104 --> 30:08.306
What time is your next thing?

30:08.406 --> 30:09.167
2 o'clock.

30:09.187 --> 30:11.030
More or less 2 to 10.

30:11.050 --> 30:11.831
No, no, no.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.754
You've been picked up at 2.20.

30:13.954 --> 30:18.781
I've had a five-minute conversation with you.

30:19.042 --> 30:19.142
Yeah.

30:19.409 --> 30:24.096
Okay, well, let's get on to whatever other things.

30:24.216 --> 30:25.638
Am I on to the right stuff?

30:25.658 --> 30:37.575
I think we're covering the things I want to... I think you're talking about the idea that you had about the concisement of the building is really important.

30:37.595 --> 30:43.904
Yeah, well, I don't know where it came from, but it was one of the books I wanted to write would be like that.

30:44.365 --> 30:45.847
In a sense, the ink truck was that way.

30:45.867 --> 30:47.509
You know, it made those jumps...

30:48.046 --> 30:56.958
I guess I'm interested also, again, I'm not asking many specific questions about the novel, because I don't think I have to do that.

30:58.440 --> 30:58.981
Pardon me.

31:00.503 --> 31:12.239
You've talked often about Albany and the cycle, and I'm wondering, is there an end, in your view, to the cycle, or does the cycle keep going as long as you keep going?

31:12.299 --> 31:14.442
Or do you think at some point it will be complete?

31:14.877 --> 31:17.663
And you'll want to move on to other areas?

31:17.843 --> 31:18.004
No.

31:18.825 --> 31:20.188
And it is all part of the course?

31:20.208 --> 31:23.736
There are no other areas.

31:25.299 --> 31:25.399
Okay.

31:25.419 --> 31:28.145
No, it's just a kind of constant.

31:29.468 --> 31:31.131
Could I get anyone anything else?

31:31.499 --> 31:34.503
Enjoy your lunch.

31:36.225 --> 31:36.425
Thank you.

31:36.445 --> 31:42.492
It's a constant growth from within the stories themselves.

31:42.632 --> 31:50.522
I have, you know, every so often I have a novel of the 60s now that I want to do about a priest.

31:50.542 --> 31:59.953
I have a novel of pre-war 40s, late 30s that may have something to do with theater but also

32:01.840 --> 32:06.868
Probably about a lawyer, and maybe it's a court case, I'm not sure.

32:09.612 --> 32:19.306
But it's more a character-driven event at this stage, that novel.

32:19.346 --> 32:30.463
That seems to be the one I want to write, and yet I haven't had a chance to... I've got these three novels now that are always...

32:31.675 --> 32:41.047
floating free in my brain to tempt me to come and do this one, do this one, do this one.

32:41.067 --> 32:42.248
And I don't know which one to do.

32:42.268 --> 32:48.276
I don't know what the... There's nothing compelling in any of the three yet.

32:49.037 --> 32:51.580
They all are there, and I really want to write them all.

32:51.740 --> 32:55.905
And you're certainly not doing them in any kind of chronological fashion or systematic.

32:56.366 --> 32:57.547
No, nothing like that.

32:57.808 --> 32:59.590
It's how they present themselves and...

33:00.599 --> 33:12.613
Tony Bennett was at the ABA, believe it or not.

33:12.633 --> 33:12.854
Yeah.

33:12.874 --> 33:16.198
This is very nice, I have to say.

33:16.218 --> 33:16.899
That looks beautiful.

33:17.259 --> 33:19.021
The oil is like this.

33:19.041 --> 33:19.802
Was it poached?

33:19.822 --> 33:20.523
Did they see poached?

33:20.543 --> 33:24.768
Yeah, very good.

33:24.948 --> 33:26.370
One killer quote on this.

33:26.992 --> 33:30.716
which I probably got going, if I go back to my earlier interviews, I'll find it.

33:30.836 --> 33:48.375
But again, the meaning, the metaphoric significance for you of Albany and why Albany, or did you know it was Albany with the ink truck or with Billy or with Legs, or that, what the heck, I'm into it now and this is where it goes.

33:50.277 --> 33:52.159
I didn't know when I was in Legs, no.

33:53.860 --> 33:56.323
Legs was Albany and I was discovering it, but...

33:56.573 --> 34:04.783
I had no idea what I was going to do.

34:05.664 --> 34:07.125
These things presented themselves.

34:10.990 --> 34:19.560
Legs came out of my desire to write a political model about Patsy McCall.

34:19.912 --> 34:23.576
I was going to do that way back in the late 60s.

34:23.596 --> 34:26.139
Almost 30 years ago.

34:27.220 --> 34:33.426
And as soon as I started to write it, I decided I should put Lakes Diamond into it.

34:36.430 --> 34:37.931
Oh, that's another book.

34:38.632 --> 34:39.493
Maybe it's a play.

34:39.513 --> 34:41.595
Probably it's a book.

34:41.615 --> 34:42.856
Maybe it's a long, short story.

34:42.917 --> 34:43.477
I don't know why it is.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.259
Maybe it's part of something else.

34:47.021 --> 34:48.062
Which is the...

34:48.835 --> 34:53.207
The death of a lake planet.

34:55.232 --> 34:59.824
Kind of a notion of how to do that now.

35:00.175 --> 35:19.839
I think I was involved in Albany in the Ink Truck in Lex.

35:19.859 --> 35:21.721
That was a question.

35:21.781 --> 35:22.362
And I didn't.

35:22.502 --> 35:28.950
I was very much...

35:30.010 --> 35:32.654
involved in the projects as they were.

35:32.694 --> 35:34.437
I took the rest of your role, I'm sorry.

35:34.517 --> 35:35.158
That's okay.

35:35.378 --> 35:36.259
Don't worry about it.

35:37.021 --> 35:38.022
You're welcome.

35:38.242 --> 35:39.584
That's your addition, not mine.

35:39.785 --> 35:40.265
It's okay.

35:40.486 --> 35:41.367
I just needed a knife.

35:41.948 --> 35:43.350
What do you want, butter?

35:43.470 --> 35:44.812
There's butters right here.

35:45.073 --> 35:46.635
This one, I don't want all that bread.

35:48.877 --> 35:57.925
Well, was there any kind of a... I'm wondering if there's any of yourself in any of these characters.

35:57.985 --> 36:02.109
Certainly here we have a newspaper man who's also a creative writer.

36:02.850 --> 36:05.992
He becomes a playwright.

36:06.012 --> 36:11.237
So, I mean, how much of Will Kennedy is in any of these characters?

36:11.257 --> 36:12.158
This one in particular.

36:12.278 --> 36:16.422
I'm inside all of them, I presume.

36:17.243 --> 36:17.803
But they're...

36:19.167 --> 36:22.072
They're really not, none of them are autobiographical.

36:23.775 --> 36:28.843
Well, a newspaper man is a very useful kind of a character, isn't he, too?

36:28.903 --> 36:44.128
No, I mean, really, because he observes, he's a trained, he's present at a lot of things, and I know Ed Doctorow's book last year, or was it two years ago, The Water Works,

36:44.581 --> 36:55.377
very effectively use a 19th century New York City newspaper man, you know, narrating of it.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.782
An untold story.

37:01.547 --> 37:06.754
Cominantly enormous figures.

37:06.775 --> 37:10.420
Every, uh...

37:10.771 --> 37:11.693
Everything I do.

37:11.713 --> 37:18.289
Journalists figure probably everything I do.

37:21.115 --> 37:21.857
That's my life.

37:22.518 --> 37:25.766
I've been a journalist all my life.

37:25.946 --> 37:28.813
It's been a great...

37:29.367 --> 37:32.151
thing to be.

37:32.492 --> 37:34.835
Led me places I would never have gotten otherwise.

37:35.055 --> 37:38.180
Thank you for that.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.743
But do you think you bring a reporter's eye to your fiction?

37:41.024 --> 37:41.344
I do.

37:43.708 --> 37:50.037
I hope I don't bring a reporter's language or clichés.

37:50.057 --> 37:55.064
I hope I bring, you know, a novelist's imagination.

37:55.084 --> 37:57.348
Well, first thing, you're not doing these things on deadline either.

37:57.448 --> 37:58.349
That's right.

37:58.369 --> 37:59.070
That's right.

38:04.417 --> 38:33.147
This is very good.

38:33.167 --> 38:33.748
I've traveled with mine.
