WEBVTT

00:01.482 --> 00:02.002
There you go.

00:02.223 --> 00:03.684
Yeah.

00:03.704 --> 00:03.804
Okay.

00:03.864 --> 00:04.625
The tape is running.

00:05.485 --> 00:08.668
No, I appreciate your asking.

00:08.688 --> 00:10.229
Because really, you have to.

00:10.269 --> 00:12.571
I wouldn't do it if you didn't want me to.

00:14.373 --> 00:16.875
You're having your coffee and I'm just finishing my bagel.

00:17.856 --> 00:20.618
Oh, I was going to accuse me of being late.

00:20.658 --> 00:22.720
I was going to tell you what I've done since I've been up.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.641
Well, what have you done since you've been up?

00:25.242 --> 00:25.322
Huh?

00:25.342 --> 00:25.902
What have you done?

00:26.343 --> 00:27.083
Anything interesting?

00:27.144 --> 00:30.146
Oh, walked the dog, cleaned out the refrigerator.

00:31.047 --> 00:31.287
Mm-hmm.

00:31.823 --> 00:41.075
unpacked some stuff I brought up from New York and made a shopping list because I have a friend coming down from Montreal.

00:41.315 --> 00:42.637
Oh, that sounds like fun.

00:42.717 --> 00:43.298
For a weekend.

00:43.999 --> 00:50.167
I'll be here when Stanley... I live with a man named Stanley Leff, L-E-F-F.

00:50.187 --> 00:56.775
We've been together for almost 10 years now, so maybe that was already true the last time I talked to you.

00:57.536 --> 01:00.480
We spoke the last time after Emily...

01:00.899 --> 01:01.340
Uh-huh.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.381
Well, then it wasn't true.

01:02.601 --> 01:07.328
And then another woman, when I was at the Worcester paper, came in and interviewed you.

01:08.650 --> 01:08.790
Uh-huh.

01:08.810 --> 01:09.231
Okay.

01:09.251 --> 01:11.054
And I think it was for August, but I'm not sure.

01:11.074 --> 01:12.215
But that's 83, right?

01:12.896 --> 01:13.998
Um, MLM was 80.

01:14.258 --> 01:16.662
Yeah, MLM was... Oh, my God.

01:16.682 --> 01:18.505
Don't tell me that.

01:18.685 --> 01:19.446
It is time goes.

01:19.466 --> 01:22.490
So then I guess it was August that you talked to Dolores.

01:23.672 --> 01:26.196
Anyway, this is quite a change of pace for you, I guess.

01:26.576 --> 01:27.818
I guess we can start...

01:28.186 --> 01:29.267
easily.

01:30.549 --> 01:34.034
Did you kind of conceive of this as a change of pace?

01:34.174 --> 01:38.399
No, I never think that way.

01:41.383 --> 01:55.662
Let's see, in 1980, let's see, August was 83, I meant to write about Mata Hari, and I wrote a book instead called His Little Women, but in the interim, I had a very serious

01:56.654 --> 02:21.497
illness that people are are uh even doctors disagree about but i lost my short-term memory and went on a computer and wrote um that was when i wrote his little women in which some people feel you can see the the tracks of my memory loss i haven't had the courage to go back and read it yet but at any rate that came out it was a great disappointment in um

02:22.945 --> 02:24.287
commercially at the very least.

02:24.487 --> 02:27.110
As I say, I haven't re-read it yet, so I don't know what I think of it.

02:28.372 --> 02:32.377
And then... You say you haven't read it yet, or you haven't read it at all?

02:32.638 --> 02:33.919
No, that's not.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.523
I read the book hundreds of times.

02:36.543 --> 02:38.526
I'm just kidding.

02:40.368 --> 02:45.014
And then Stanley and I went off to Italy.

02:45.134 --> 02:46.276
I had never been to Italy.

02:46.376 --> 02:48.399
I'm sort of a non-traveler.

02:48.899 --> 02:52.564
I've been places where my publishers have sent me tickets to go.

02:52.898 --> 02:57.145
I mean, I'm a traveler within the United States, but I don't like being where I don't have a language.

02:57.165 --> 03:01.452
I don't have the travel impulse, whatever it is, intellectual curiosity.

03:02.554 --> 03:11.348
Anyway, we went to Italy, and I had finished His Little Women, and we went to Venice.

03:11.368 --> 03:13.652
This was the second place we were in.

03:14.153 --> 03:19.902
And late one afternoon, when we'd been there two or three days, Stanley...

03:20.438 --> 03:50.293
took a nap and I sat down at the window and I there was a notebook nearby and I started writing a story that turned into a long story called 116th Street Jenny about a young woman from an academic family in Manhattan who two older an older brother and sister both of them were academics and from her earliest days she's huddling in the kitchen with with the cooks and eventually she goes to Italy and

03:50.965 --> 03:59.260
as a babysitter, and has an affair with a man tending the vineyards of the family she's working for.

03:59.300 --> 04:16.230
And then she comes home, and there's some more to the story, but I thought it was finished, and what I meant to write was a book, a sequel to August, because I was interested in the girls making the transition from the analytic to the

04:16.463 --> 04:17.344
to the politics.

04:17.405 --> 04:19.829
She goes off to Washington at the end of August.

04:20.510 --> 04:24.516
And I wanted to take her through Washington a bit.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.419
Was this going to be with the same characters?

04:27.501 --> 04:31.508
Well, the same main character, Don.

04:32.590 --> 04:41.865
And I sat down to write, and what came out instead was a continuation of this story I'd written, 116th Street, Jenny.

04:41.885 --> 04:41.965
Hmm.

04:42.417 --> 04:53.169
which she comes back to the States, isn't happy here, goes back to Italy, gets pregnant by this guy, marries him and cooks there for some years.

04:54.271 --> 04:57.254
And that's what happened.

04:57.274 --> 04:58.075
That's what came out.

04:58.115 --> 04:59.517
You don't always control.

04:59.537 --> 05:04.883
I don't believe in controlling what enters my computer.

05:04.923 --> 05:06.965
I believe in editing it after it's in there.

05:07.666 --> 05:10.129
But I don't believe that fiction writers should

05:10.784 --> 05:17.496
control too tightly what comes out because I think, I mean, August was not supposed to be a book about a psychoanalysis.

05:17.576 --> 05:19.179
It was supposed to be about a libel suit.

05:20.922 --> 05:28.455
And this girl in analysis took over the book instead of the analyst and the guy who was being sued taking over the book.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.630
This is a lighter treatment for you, though, this book.

05:32.670 --> 05:37.020
I mean, certainly compared to what you've done in the past.

05:37.521 --> 05:39.345
Well, people keep saying that.

05:39.365 --> 05:41.490
You know, to me, the stuff with the kid is pretty heavy.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.922
Painful business.

05:46.942 --> 05:48.385
You know, they're sort of the two...

05:48.938 --> 05:57.233
It seems there's the food, which is in the kitchen, and she can control it and pretty much do what she wants with it and have it come out okay.

05:57.714 --> 06:07.551
And the kids are much less subject to control, much less likely to do what you want them to do in this day and age, certainly.

06:09.174 --> 06:13.221
And the kid, of course, has another story altogether.

06:13.462 --> 06:13.562
Yeah.

06:13.542 --> 06:14.544
Which is true.

06:14.604 --> 06:16.627
I mean, the title of the book could be food.

06:16.887 --> 06:17.328
It's not.

06:17.568 --> 06:19.171
I mean, it's Olivia, right?

06:19.191 --> 06:19.691
That's right.

06:19.711 --> 06:28.465
And as a matter of fact, I fought that cover with the food on it because I felt it didn't represent the book accurately.

06:28.745 --> 06:29.066
Really?

06:30.568 --> 06:34.795
So you didn't want this bagel and the zucchini and the corn?

06:34.835 --> 06:35.796
It's very pretty.

06:35.996 --> 06:36.537
It is pretty.

06:36.557 --> 06:40.543
And it draws people, but I thought it misrepresented the book.

06:40.563 --> 06:41.625
I wanted to have...

06:42.533 --> 06:56.395
A picture, actually, the picture I had in mind at both, the picture I wanted was, you remember in the book the story about the statue, the statues of the naked boys?

06:57.397 --> 07:01.443
And they're all sort of holding this big tray or bowl.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.508
So I wanted that statue with maybe some spaghetti on top.

07:05.078 --> 07:06.260
That would have been cute.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.002
Yeah.

07:07.503 --> 07:08.104
They tried it.

07:08.144 --> 07:09.186
They didn't feel it worked.

07:09.407 --> 07:10.469
Well, I can see marketing.

07:10.509 --> 07:12.513
Now, when you say they tried it, what do you mean?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.855
They actually go to a test group.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.821
Well, I have, you know, I have some control.

07:16.901 --> 07:19.847
And so I said, I don't like this.

07:20.452 --> 07:21.934
I wanted a different cover.

07:22.494 --> 07:25.638
And they played with different ones and everyone felt they didn't work.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.340
They weren't graphically as appealing.

07:27.820 --> 07:29.702
You see, people are interested in food, though.

07:29.842 --> 07:38.192
I mean, as you just used it, as you just, I mean, not necessarily used it in the book, but as you just expressed it, food certainly is a metaphor, isn't it?

07:38.512 --> 07:39.533
It's everything.

07:39.613 --> 07:42.276
It's there in our daily lives.

07:42.356 --> 07:43.558
It cannot be eliminated.

07:43.618 --> 07:44.879
It can be pleasurable.

07:45.380 --> 07:47.522
It can be fraught with all kinds of

07:48.683 --> 07:53.630
complications, limitations, discipline from self and others.

07:53.790 --> 07:55.993
There's really nothing like it.

07:56.073 --> 07:58.877
Even shelter doesn't do it.

07:58.897 --> 08:04.665
But I mean, as you just expressed it, food, when she goes into the kitchen, she's in control.

08:05.025 --> 08:18.083
And if she follows her... Well, initially what she is, initially when she goes into the kitchen, what she is is with someone who loves her, who she doesn't feel unwelcome.

08:18.485 --> 08:21.571
She feels like part of it, and she can do something.

08:21.751 --> 08:29.405
From the time kids are very little, there are some things they can do in the kitchen if their mothers or whoever is inclined to let them.

08:30.306 --> 08:39.042
And with her family, she felt not quite a part of it, whereas she felt welcome in the kitchen with a housekeeper.

08:40.422 --> 08:48.549
There's one section there where you actually say that food has almost taken the place of sex in many contemporary lives, right?

08:48.569 --> 08:48.870
Right.

08:49.550 --> 08:55.396
Well, the whole obsessive talk, you know, and the media filler was sex for a while.

08:55.456 --> 09:00.821
And I would say, you know, somewhere from the 70s, really, we all know went from 75 to 85.

09:01.601 --> 09:08.268
And somewhere in there between diseases and it was the end of a fantasy.

09:08.288 --> 09:09.889
It wasn't just that sex involvement.

09:10.426 --> 09:40.382
diseases it was that there were other there were other difficulties that came from living a life centered around it and um people weren't about to give up the idea of having anything that was so much you know great fun you say that when you start a novel you really are you let it develop the way it and it's just being developed and then and then the re the revision phase is where you kind of shape it more to uh

09:41.172 --> 09:42.914
to where you think it ought to be, right?

09:43.034 --> 09:45.097
Well, or shape it at the very least.

09:45.177 --> 09:51.406
In other words, if August... I mean, August began as the story of a libel suit.

09:51.786 --> 09:57.574
And this guy, Vincent, from one of my early books, actually, consults this analyst for help.

09:58.015 --> 10:04.864
He's being sued by a woman he once lived with, a rather awful woman who was a hooker, actually, and he took care of her kid.

10:04.904 --> 10:11.112
And one of the real lunatic feminists grabs hold of him, a lawyer...

10:11.699 --> 10:25.258
and gets this woman to sue him over the book, and he doesn't know what to do, and he consults this analyst, Lulu Scheinfeld, and falls in love with her.

10:26.440 --> 10:34.351
And I wrote about 100, I think it was 117 pages of that, if I remember correctly.

10:34.371 --> 10:35.272
And nothing happened.

10:35.312 --> 10:36.614
It wasn't going anyplace.

10:36.634 --> 10:38.196
The libel, nothing was coming.

10:38.699 --> 10:43.544
So I said, well, I'll show Lulu at work because the work is usually the most interesting part of people.

10:44.065 --> 10:50.272
And I literally, I mean, I remember this so distinctly with all my memory stuff that I've had.

10:51.513 --> 10:52.174
I sat down.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.576
I was then renting.

10:54.696 --> 10:58.601
I guess I was still in my second marriage.

11:00.503 --> 11:08.031
We were renting a house on the tip of East Hampton on the water that's

11:08.416 --> 11:11.640
this rickety old cottage, but it was with wonderful views.

11:11.981 --> 11:24.417
And I made my coffee, and I got my previous day's New York Times, which is the way I did it there, because I couldn't, it was too far to town for the current day.

11:25.739 --> 11:32.888
And I sat down, and I put aside the newspaper and started writing this

11:34.184 --> 11:38.027
This girl entered Lulu's office and took over the book, quite literally.

11:38.068 --> 11:42.091
She started talking, and I wrote for 200 pages.

11:43.132 --> 11:44.433
Later on, I shaped it.

11:44.994 --> 12:02.790
Later on, I made alternate chapters where one is of the analyst's own life, which is where it began, and the other was Dawn's life in the office, you know, showing, for one thing, the difference in how much she could...

12:03.142 --> 12:06.405
and how she could deal with patients and how she dealt with her own life.

12:07.025 --> 12:09.568
Where do these characters come from, do you figure?

12:10.629 --> 12:12.630
Well, they're all stored in my unconscious.

12:12.711 --> 12:17.495
I mean, I see similarities that other people don't see.

12:18.035 --> 12:27.404
You know, when people start this business of my own life, I say the seeds of my own life are what blossoms in a book, if not the life itself.

12:29.305 --> 12:31.107
The seeds of people.

12:32.268 --> 12:39.898
My craziest book in a way, Attachments, I don't know if you ever read about, is about women friends who marry Siamese twins.

12:39.958 --> 12:42.742
And that's the book my best friend hates.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.786
She can't read it at all because she sees me in there so much.

12:48.290 --> 12:54.298
So it's obviously, we're not talking about the events of one's life precisely, but about something else.

12:54.999 --> 12:57.482
The animating spirit, the conflicts.

12:58.728 --> 13:01.011
Now, this one had to be narrated, too, didn't it?

13:01.211 --> 13:02.974
This particular book.

13:04.415 --> 13:07.399
As opposed to... Well, as opposed to, you know, a different voice.

13:07.479 --> 13:09.101
I mean, the voice was so important here.

13:10.163 --> 13:12.526
The voice of the narrator.

13:13.647 --> 13:16.030
It came out... It began that way.

13:16.071 --> 13:23.120
The story, which was called 116th Street Jenny, it was published in Modern American Fiction.

13:25.523 --> 13:28.026
That...

13:30.335 --> 13:32.197
It began with her voice.

13:32.217 --> 13:34.320
It came out naturally that way the first time.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.964
It doesn't always happen, obviously.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.227
And it's decidedly a contemporary story, too.

13:40.247 --> 13:41.208
It would be awfully hard.

13:42.109 --> 13:44.271
I mean, changing lives.

13:44.472 --> 13:46.794
Here's a woman who left her daughter.

13:47.295 --> 13:53.342
I mean, that is almost an unforgivable thing at another time, isn't it?

13:53.362 --> 13:53.983
Yeah, sure.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.264
It's almost unforgivable.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.407
It's almost unforgivable, actually.

13:57.467 --> 13:59.149
It's a very extreme act.

13:59.189 --> 14:00.190
She had to feel...

14:00.743 --> 14:04.268
that she was utterly superfluous to the kid to do it.

14:05.310 --> 14:09.576
But, and I think it's possible by the circumstances as well.

14:09.596 --> 14:16.987
I mean, you have this Italian father, you know, and a rigid Catholic and also on his own turf.

14:17.007 --> 14:18.109
So, I mean, there are circumstances.

14:18.129 --> 14:21.634
He's not a rigid, you know, he's a Catholic when it's in his best interest.

14:21.654 --> 14:27.122
When it's in his interest and, you know, he's deeply Catholic in some way, but he certainly is not.

14:28.537 --> 14:33.502
what one would call a religious man, a legitimately religious man.

14:33.622 --> 14:43.632
And, of course, you certainly do raise issues of anti-Semitism, and there are many other contemporary themes as well in here.

14:43.772 --> 14:47.275
Well, I've been surprised that no one has talked about the abortion stuff.

14:47.315 --> 14:47.816
I don't know.

14:47.836 --> 14:54.342
To me, the central issue of the book is whether this girl...

14:55.148 --> 15:07.329
This pregnant 16-year-old is going to have a baby, or she's this highly academic kid who has no desire in the world to take care of anybody else, and she gets pregnant.

15:08.651 --> 15:15.182
And to me, the issue of how that will work out is the central issue of the book.

15:16.124 --> 15:25.730
You know, I'm looking again through the book here as we speak, and of course you say you don't want it to be perceived as a food book.

15:26.271 --> 15:31.686
No, I don't mind how it's perceived as long as it sells, but I hope when people read it, they'll see that.

15:32.257 --> 15:34.980
All right, I interrupted you.

15:35.000 --> 15:35.481
You go ahead.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.343
No, but I'm just reading the very first sentence.

15:37.743 --> 15:40.927
It was my intention that this memoir be a lighthearted kitchen romance.

15:41.227 --> 15:42.749
My life and food, you know.

15:43.790 --> 15:43.911
Right.

15:43.931 --> 15:45.472
But that's her intention, Nick.

15:45.492 --> 15:45.993
That's right.

15:46.133 --> 15:46.554
That's right.

15:46.874 --> 15:47.174
You know.

15:47.655 --> 15:57.126
But how many people never read me on the first page before they start writing their reviews, you know, or throwing up their jacket art, you know.

15:58.568 --> 15:58.688
Yeah.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.489
Right.

15:59.509 --> 16:00.610
You might say that.

16:01.130 --> 16:07.940
You certainly bring a New York sensibility to what you write, don't you?

16:07.960 --> 16:08.641
Yeah, I really do.

16:08.661 --> 16:16.132
It doesn't explain why Boston's, I think, my best town in the whole country for selling books, but... Is that right?

16:16.392 --> 16:16.632
Yeah.

16:17.814 --> 16:24.724
Maybe Boston people read about... Bostonians read about...

16:25.447 --> 16:39.793
the New York sensibility like foreign tourists reading about going to I know I find that I try to be especially since I've got newspapers on both coasts and in the middle though you really don't want to focus on

16:40.583 --> 16:43.406
writers from one region, but you can't help it.

16:43.466 --> 16:49.112
I mean, you know, when Grace Paley comes around, you've got to do Grace Paley, regardless of where she's from, right?

16:51.075 --> 16:55.760
So New York, any place, once it gets the reputation for being the center of action, draws people.

16:55.860 --> 16:56.341
That's right.

16:56.501 --> 17:00.545
Everybody wasn't born in New York City, but they go there, you know.

17:00.565 --> 17:00.986
That's right.

17:01.086 --> 17:07.553
In fact, most of us, one of my kids now lives in California, the other in Framingham.

17:07.972 --> 17:08.533
Right up here.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.375
Yeah.

17:09.676 --> 17:11.820
And he went to school in Boston and has never won.

17:12.261 --> 17:15.909
And my best friend, all three of her kids stayed in Boston.

17:15.949 --> 17:19.317
The New York kids who go to Boston don't want to come back.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.023
And that's a tough city to leave.

17:22.283 --> 17:27.314
I certainly in my younger days had opportunities to go to much larger newspapers.

17:27.916 --> 17:28.056
Mm-hmm.

17:28.222 --> 17:29.383
But who wants to leave here?

17:29.403 --> 17:30.945
I love it up here.

17:31.145 --> 17:34.688
They have many of New York's virtues without some of the difficulties.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.630
But let me say also, I love New York.

17:37.711 --> 17:44.477
You won't find any Boston people who will admit to that foolishly, but it is the greatest city.

17:44.817 --> 17:54.126
But just to go back, I mean, in the last couple of months, Paley, Dr. Rowe, even Kotswinkle's new book is set in New York, which is crazy.

17:54.246 --> 17:55.107
It's a fun book.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.205
Is the doctor wonderful?

17:57.746 --> 17:59.428
I can't read fiction when I'm working.

18:00.991 --> 18:03.555
He got very respectful.

18:03.575 --> 18:04.276
I liked it.

18:04.557 --> 18:05.198
I really did.

18:05.478 --> 18:07.321
I just like everything he writes.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.528
He's a really wonderful writer.

18:12.270 --> 18:16.116
And I have a hard time not liking anything that he does.

18:16.467 --> 18:17.969
Yeah, I feel the same way.

18:17.989 --> 18:19.490
When he gives a speech, I'll listen.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.695
I just hope he gets that cable thing going.

18:24.075 --> 18:27.619
Remember, he was going to get involved in a 24-hour cable.

18:28.821 --> 18:30.342
Also, let's talk about the mother-daughter.

18:31.203 --> 18:40.934
I mean, there is a whole, I hesitate to use the word genre, but there certainly is a generation of mother-daughter books, explorations.

18:41.835 --> 18:46.120
Tell me what you thought you might bring to the debate here.

18:46.893 --> 18:50.038
Take it anywhere you want.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.201
I'm sorry, what?

18:52.221 --> 18:54.425
I said, when you frame it that way, I want to hang up.

18:56.007 --> 18:56.548
Don't hang up.

18:56.788 --> 18:58.070
It drives me wild.

18:58.090 --> 19:01.115
Take it anywhere you want, is what I said.

19:01.175 --> 19:07.765
Well, one of the things that's true is that the early 70s, the first Ms.

19:07.805 --> 19:09.508
Magazine flourish, you know.

19:09.860 --> 19:24.435
The mother-daughter relationship, which had been underplayed, was suddenly romanticized and suddenly, you know, nobody needed men, which is sort of funny, and mother-daughter is the only thing in the whole world that counts.

19:24.495 --> 19:37.588
Well, it's certainly the primary relationship in one's early years, and then hopefully one moves away some, and then if things go well, as...

19:38.041 --> 19:41.806
Later, after adolescence, one becomes friends again, you know.

19:41.866 --> 19:46.451
Two becomes friends.

19:47.933 --> 19:58.586
At any rate, I think that, you know, when politics enters personal relations, there are always difficulties.

19:59.166 --> 20:03.812
And while...

20:04.957 --> 20:34.947
doubtless some good good things came out of it a lot of how shall we say it a lot of it was baloney um uh it's very much more complex than that um if if only because i mean it has to be in fact uh kids have to go through adolescence and rebel and then grow up that's you know the ideal although it's hellish to live through uh

20:37.475 --> 20:50.012
But in this case, you know, the relation was infinitely complicated by what the father did with the daughter.

20:51.234 --> 21:04.832
And then there was, I guess, the cultural difference made it harder because there is that extraordinarily...

21:06.010 --> 21:17.366
idealized relation between, I think, between many Italian fathers and daughters.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.988
And who knows?

21:19.008 --> 21:22.373
I don't want to... Can I just eliminate that whole sentence?

21:22.854 --> 21:28.462
I don't want to sound as though I think I'm an authority on Italian fathers and daughters.

21:28.562 --> 21:31.326
Let's just talk about Angelo, who...

21:32.234 --> 21:36.200
in a sense, by marrying a foreigner, which he does as well.

21:36.220 --> 21:38.124
It's not just Carolyn who marries a foreigner.

21:38.144 --> 21:51.706
So in a sense, by marrying a foreigner, he leaves himself needing that elementary communication that comes when people come from a common culture.

21:53.228 --> 21:59.338
And so he needs to, you know, the love that he feels for

22:00.702 --> 22:11.035
This lively American girl, before they marry, gets transferred in a way that probably doesn't do either of them any good.

22:11.676 --> 22:24.213
You know, it's very clear that the kid would have been better off if the father had let her grow up, let her... She would have turned against her mother maybe anyway, some, but there would have been cultural limitations.

22:24.793 --> 22:27.537
And they would have stayed together and...

22:28.141 --> 22:31.713
And the kid might have outgrown that Oedipal attachment.

22:31.854 --> 22:35.105
As it is, she's completely mired in it.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.369
Yeah.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.978
She's not the most...

22:39.751 --> 22:40.392
What's the word?

22:40.412 --> 22:41.753
I'm sympathetic of girls.

22:41.773 --> 22:43.515
Well, she's a pain in the ass.

22:43.535 --> 22:45.397
She's a total pain in the ass, isn't she?

22:45.698 --> 22:46.398
Yeah, she really is.

22:46.699 --> 22:51.544
And I wonder, is this endemic to the species of teenage girls?

22:52.205 --> 22:53.847
I have two daughters, by the way.

22:53.867 --> 22:54.287
Oh, you do?

22:54.307 --> 22:57.191
They're 13 and 11, and they're wonderful.

22:57.631 --> 22:57.751
Right.

22:57.931 --> 22:58.913
But let's just, you know.

22:59.773 --> 23:00.534
It's getting rough.

23:01.215 --> 23:04.138
You know, they get older, and every day they get a little older.

23:04.158 --> 23:04.479
Yeah, yeah.

23:06.121 --> 23:06.501
Well.

23:06.751 --> 23:19.707
I've seen, I know one family where there are four daughters, and there's been somewhat different treatment.

23:19.727 --> 23:28.018
Basically, the mother has been a loving mother most of the time, and never completely unloving.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.442
I can get into trouble with this one.

23:31.743 --> 23:36.710
All right, you will leave out any specifics that might cast them.

23:37.391 --> 23:41.538
And anyway, the point is that all four girls, the youngest is now a teenager.

23:42.719 --> 23:51.713
And all four of them, two or three of them were quite reasonable human beings, and then they had adolescence, and then it was hell.

23:53.295 --> 23:53.836
Just hell.

23:54.657 --> 23:56.620
The ones who are most steadily loved.

23:57.595 --> 24:02.567
Are there special pressures today, or is this basically human nature, do you suppose?

24:02.628 --> 24:06.678
Today meaning, you know, the time in which we live.

24:06.698 --> 24:09.264
You know, today is in another era.

24:09.304 --> 24:13.354
For one thing, a lot of girls were married by the time they were 15, 16 years old.

24:13.414 --> 24:14.297
Isn't that funny?

24:14.317 --> 24:14.878
We were out.

24:15.230 --> 24:16.171
It was for dinner.

24:16.392 --> 24:18.114
It was my daughter's birthday the other day.

24:18.154 --> 24:26.364
My mother, we went out and she said, you know, my wife, she said, well, I was much older than Barbara here when I got married.

24:26.384 --> 24:28.567
You know, 18 or whatever it was.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.089
And she was pregnant with my brother.

24:30.109 --> 24:32.332
I was 19 the first time I got married.

24:32.713 --> 24:36.818
And what's remarkable to me now is that I was still living at home then.

24:36.918 --> 24:41.524
And one of the things that goes on that's so wild these days is that the kids never...

24:41.842 --> 24:42.703
Never grow up.

24:42.763 --> 24:45.588
They act like grownups in some ways much earlier.

24:45.948 --> 24:47.110
Then they never leave.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.753
The kids come home.

24:50.255 --> 24:55.062
If they were away from home for college, whatever, then they come home and live for a while.

24:55.242 --> 24:58.387
Well, it's less expensive these days, too, probably.

24:58.407 --> 25:02.153
I mean, there aren't any number of other factors that come into play, I guess.

25:02.734 --> 25:02.854
Right.

25:03.425 --> 25:06.950
You don't see this as a satire in any way, do you?

25:07.591 --> 25:08.352
On whom?

25:08.372 --> 25:09.614
No, I mean not on whom.

25:09.694 --> 25:11.696
I mean the book in general, on things.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.901
I mean, I don't think that there's any element of satire in here.

25:15.061 --> 25:20.488
Well, I know I tried to be funny, but I don't think of it as satire.

25:20.509 --> 25:21.610
No, I don't either.

25:21.710 --> 25:22.852
I just saw it someplace.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.397
Where does the humor come from?

25:26.877 --> 25:30.082
Does this kind of generate itself?

25:30.602 --> 25:32.165
Do you want my best friend's phone number?

25:32.485 --> 25:33.246
Should we give you my...

25:33.563 --> 25:38.030
Credentials about being, I mean, you know, there's humor in my other book.

25:38.090 --> 25:40.895
Attachments is a funny book.

25:40.955 --> 25:43.239
His Little Women has a lot of funny stuff in it.

25:44.400 --> 25:52.293
The initial stuff about Los Angeles and Hollywood is so funny that nobody would talk to me there when it was published.

25:52.393 --> 25:52.854
What else?

25:52.994 --> 25:54.036
I mean, Goodbye.

25:54.252 --> 25:57.177
Humor stems, you know, from the situation.

25:57.337 --> 26:01.304
The bar isn't very funny for the obvious reasons.

26:01.324 --> 26:04.309
All right, but it does have to be organic, as they say.

26:04.349 --> 26:07.654
I guess it has to generate itself from the situation.

26:07.794 --> 26:11.561
Yeah, well, I'm a Bronx Jew, you know, funny sometimes.

26:11.581 --> 26:13.644
So what's coming next?

26:13.684 --> 26:15.467
Have you thought about that at all?

26:15.868 --> 26:16.469
Oh, indeed.

26:16.529 --> 26:20.175
Well, there are two things going on.

26:21.337 --> 26:25.241
And it's a coincidence that they both related to Emmeline.

26:26.102 --> 26:27.963
My hometown, you know.

26:28.023 --> 26:28.944
I'm from Lowell.

26:28.964 --> 26:29.465
Lowell.

26:29.745 --> 26:30.686
I'd forgotten that.

26:30.726 --> 26:32.047
I think maybe I knew it.

26:32.288 --> 26:38.233
An opera is being made of Emmeline.

26:38.453 --> 26:41.897
In fact, the Lowell Son takes my column, by the way.

26:41.997 --> 26:42.517
Oh, good.

26:42.838 --> 26:44.279
It's going to be an opera.

26:44.299 --> 26:47.042
It's going to be performed in Santa Fe in 1996.

26:47.122 --> 26:48.863
No kidding.

26:49.104 --> 26:49.504
Yep.

26:50.007 --> 26:54.291
All the elements of the plot are intact?

26:55.152 --> 26:56.052
Yes.

26:56.072 --> 26:56.953
Yes.

26:57.934 --> 27:00.596
The composer's name is Tobias Picker.

27:00.717 --> 27:02.158
How do you spell Picker?

27:02.498 --> 27:04.680
P-I-C-K-E-R.

27:04.700 --> 27:04.900
Okay.

27:06.081 --> 27:15.129
And he saw a PBS thing about Emmeline and got interested in it and mentioned it to a friend who knew me and we got together.

27:15.410 --> 27:19.153
And Tobias, he's modern but melodic composer.

27:19.555 --> 27:30.410
his music is and um the libretto is being written by a poet named Francis J.D.

27:30.450 --> 27:46.812
McClatchy he's well known and maybe coincidentally um my next book is going to be about his son ah uh

27:48.445 --> 28:14.706
sequel so to speak yeah i i use that word but i hate it but there's no other word listen joe heller can do a sequel to catch 22 33 years after the fact i'm sorry what in fact i don't think he could uh i mean i think it's a did that come out hey i just got the proofs i just got i'm interviewing him in a couple weeks i'm going up to vermont next week to see john irving

28:15.040 --> 28:19.288
And that's going to be, I just got that book, and this is getting terrible reviews.

28:19.548 --> 28:22.894
He's written a couple, some wonderful books.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.577
He's written a really awful one.

28:25.218 --> 28:30.207
The only one I ever reviewed was Hotel New Hampshire, which was just dead garbage.

28:30.387 --> 28:31.910
It was GARP, you know, revisited.

28:31.950 --> 28:36.458
Yes, exactly, and it didn't have any internal life to it.

28:36.809 --> 28:40.975
And I can't even remember what it was about, to tell you the truth, except there was a stuff there.

28:40.995 --> 28:42.638
It was the same, no, revisited.

28:42.738 --> 28:44.480
It was all the same people, sort of recycled.

28:44.580 --> 28:48.086
Yeah, in fact, I reviewed it myself, and I didn't review Garb.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.568
Somebody else did it for me then.

28:49.688 --> 28:50.689
Garb was wonderful.

28:50.890 --> 28:51.791
Garb was great.

28:51.811 --> 28:52.272
Mostly wonderful.

28:53.013 --> 28:54.195
And there were a couple of others.

28:54.215 --> 28:59.002
Since my memory loss, I haven't read much fiction, but Cider House Rules is supposed to be wonderful.

28:59.022 --> 29:01.225
Yeah, it was all in Meany or something.

29:02.106 --> 29:05.331
I'm going to spend the next week just getting ready for this, because...

29:06.290 --> 29:13.938
I did an interview with Tim O'Brien a couple weeks ago, and he's friendly, and he had a very interesting observation.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.781
He said this is a guy that was perceived as a literary writer.

29:18.763 --> 29:19.744
John Irving.

29:20.105 --> 29:21.606
You know, prior to GARP.

29:21.746 --> 29:23.348
Yeah, he's a storyteller.

29:23.588 --> 29:26.431
But Iowa Writers Workshop, the whole thing.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.935
And then all of a sudden he has this extraordinary success.

29:30.337 --> 29:37.543
And he feels that it actually took away from, he said, there are some really magical parts of garb that got lost in this whole commercial thing.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.605
You know, this wave that washed over him.

29:40.285 --> 29:41.607
It's a very interesting observation.

29:41.827 --> 29:42.808
I'm simplifying it here.

29:42.828 --> 29:45.250
In fact, I'm going to look back at O'Brien's.

29:45.650 --> 29:50.354
As someone who's not classified as a literary writer, I resent that distinction.

29:50.434 --> 29:52.115
You might talk about that.

29:52.356 --> 29:54.197
I think there are better writers and worse ones.

29:54.277 --> 29:59.922
I think that a writer who is

30:00.695 --> 30:05.343
A decent writer is some degree of literary, you know.

30:05.403 --> 30:07.667
I mean, literature means what?

30:07.827 --> 30:08.408
What does it mean?

30:08.488 --> 30:10.231
Fiction, doesn't it?

30:10.251 --> 30:10.492
I guess.

30:10.512 --> 30:11.774
I haven't looked it up in the dictionary.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.480
But I think that...

30:16.220 --> 30:19.185
I don't know, it looks like a way of dividing up people on bookshelves.

30:19.485 --> 30:24.173
I'm always amused when you buy a VCR and the guy says, now you've got to read the literature on this, you know.

30:24.233 --> 30:26.977
Yes.

30:26.997 --> 30:27.999
I look around, you know.

30:28.500 --> 30:32.386
He means the owner's manual, you know.

30:32.406 --> 30:35.130
It's a very loosely defined word, isn't it?

30:35.311 --> 30:40.018
No one actually, the Japanese instructions we're getting now, no one even tries to buy that.

30:40.038 --> 30:41.140
Oh, God, I mean, they're funny.

30:41.160 --> 30:41.721
They're amazing.

30:41.701 --> 30:48.609
There's a fortune to be made for technical writers who can take these things and make them really accessible.

30:48.849 --> 30:49.730
I really believe that.

30:50.271 --> 30:52.494
They're really trying now, but it's not working.

30:52.594 --> 30:54.556
It's odd.

30:54.596 --> 30:59.722
They will not use American proofreaders or editors.

31:00.784 --> 31:05.109
I can't remember what it was we bought recently, but it's a bit of a joke.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.012
Well, I remember when I was in the service way back,

31:08.633 --> 31:27.283
um not on my ship but another ship they these cruise books that we used to produce you know they're like yearbooks only they were cruise books and most of them went to these japanese firms and in this particular case not one of these guys could read english and they put in the you know they did gorgeous color reproduction but they had these
