WEBVTT

00:03.811 --> 00:08.698
So we're on, and we're talking to Susan.

00:08.798 --> 00:09.078
Okay.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.191
So we can just chat a bit, if you don't mind, about a little background.

00:18.431 --> 00:19.493
Between gulps of muffin.

00:19.733 --> 00:22.557
I'm going to grab one of these myself, if I may.

00:23.098 --> 00:23.999
This looks wonderful.

00:25.241 --> 00:25.481
Sure.

00:25.521 --> 00:30.308
A little bit on the sticky side.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.818
I'll be transcribing this.

00:55.702 --> 01:03.973
I was looking at Patience and Fortitude yesterday, which I have to confess, I haven't read all the way through, but I reread your

01:05.135 --> 01:06.957
acknowledgments.

01:07.838 --> 01:09.640
It's funny how many people we know in common.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.885
Read the acknowledgments in general.

01:13.905 --> 01:20.172
It's a continuation of the same, that same circle of people.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.696
But this is really more library-oriented, this book here.

01:24.096 --> 01:24.216
Right.

01:25.878 --> 01:29.382
Of the twelve chapters, seven are definitely library chapters.

01:29.402 --> 01:29.863
That's great.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.986
I'm glad HarperCollins wants to publish it.

01:33.006 --> 01:33.927
Well, he did, um,

01:34.717 --> 01:36.520
It's got 30,000 copies in print.

01:37.000 --> 01:37.581
That's wonderful.

01:37.922 --> 01:38.543
Perfect.

01:38.563 --> 01:41.106
You know, and the high cover is being delayed.

01:41.327 --> 01:45.152
I don't have to.

01:45.172 --> 01:48.217
Now we start.

01:48.237 --> 01:50.019
As soon as we see one number move.

01:51.501 --> 01:52.944
I don't have to do that, but there you go.

01:54.246 --> 01:55.848
You got a theory as to what's going to happen.

01:56.028 --> 01:59.193
Well, you know that I like science and speculative fiction.

01:59.894 --> 02:04.200
And I had been tweeting Star Trek, which is one of my favorite shows,

02:04.990 --> 02:07.012
as fiction, purely fiction.

02:07.633 --> 02:08.073
Just that.

02:08.594 --> 02:11.497
And a way to, as my husband says, rot my mind.

02:12.358 --> 02:30.116
And then I realized that the way things are moving, when you see Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Enterprise, dealing with information by talking to a computer and getting information from a computer, that's already happening.

02:31.237 --> 02:33.900
And I'm convinced that over the

02:34.032 --> 02:43.024
years, and it may not be centuries, it may be decades, we'll see most of the information that we use converted to electronic form.

02:43.846 --> 02:53.459
But that then, when Jean-Luc Picard goes back to his cabin to relax, he picks up a book and reads it.

02:53.479 --> 02:55.442
I think so, and that's what I say in my new book.

02:56.423 --> 02:58.866
I quote Billington, in fact.

02:58.886 --> 03:02.892
And he says, I think that what all of this electronic stuff that's

03:03.057 --> 03:09.545
going on will accomplish, is that the printed book now has the opportunity to achieve its true potential.

03:10.707 --> 03:15.994
And then I quote none other than Charles Lamb, you know, but he said, I'll read anything, I'll read any book.

03:16.454 --> 03:18.717
He said, well, first of all, let me tell you what I think a book is.

03:19.198 --> 03:28.390
And he excludes almanacs, he excludes all of these, you know, reference things, but we're talking in the early 1800s, 200 years ago.

03:28.758 --> 03:32.003
What's different from what he's saying there than what we say today?

03:32.043 --> 03:32.503
Nothing.

03:32.523 --> 03:33.405
I don't use telephone.

03:33.425 --> 03:34.707
I throw you all my telephone books.

03:34.807 --> 03:37.811
I can get anybody I want anywhere in America.

03:37.831 --> 03:38.953
I just, it was wonderful.

03:38.973 --> 03:41.997
I had all these phone books from Washington, New York.

03:42.638 --> 03:43.459
Threw them all away.

03:43.559 --> 03:45.903
MapQuest that you went on to yesterday.

03:46.483 --> 03:48.066
Encyclopedia stuff.

03:49.428 --> 03:51.971
Better, because you can constantly update it.

03:52.212 --> 03:52.712
Right.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.275
But to read the pleasure of a book.

03:54.295 --> 03:56.638
And then I have a chapter on paratextual elements.

03:57.378 --> 04:00.020
Jeanette's book on paratexts.

04:00.201 --> 04:02.383
It's going to be a fun book.

04:02.403 --> 04:07.167
I think it's going to be really, where the artifact really has to be part of the package.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.128
Sure.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.350
Where it goes beyond just the text.

04:11.230 --> 04:13.653
You know, we're going to have any number of examples.

04:13.673 --> 04:15.795
That was your kind of point.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.076
I had the luck with you there.

04:17.436 --> 04:18.797
Well, that's basically it.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.760
Well, no, there's another piece to it.

04:22.541 --> 04:27.385
I started working at Harvard in 1963, and at first,

04:28.630 --> 04:30.212
I filed cards in the catalog.

04:30.492 --> 04:34.638
That was before I got my master's degree, before I realized that I did like libraries.

04:35.359 --> 04:46.713
And then once I got into library school, they were forming their first systems office, and for some reason they asked me to be the first member of that systems office.

04:46.733 --> 04:47.694
Do you know Dick DeGennaro?

04:48.816 --> 04:57.827
He was the director of the New York Public Library for a while, and he was at Harvard earlier, and then he was later.

04:58.567 --> 05:04.195
He retired finally from Harvard about five years ago or six years ago.

05:05.637 --> 05:10.965
But he was in charge of the systems office, and I reported to him, but he wasn't doing systems work.

05:10.985 --> 05:13.629
He was just sort of overseeing what I was doing.

05:14.730 --> 05:19.397
And at that time, nobody thought you could convert a whole car catalog.

05:19.437 --> 05:20.619
It was just too much to do.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.425
I'm sorry.

05:25.686 --> 05:25.806
Sorry.

05:27.473 --> 05:29.615
You couldn't convert a whole card catalog.

05:29.635 --> 05:30.836
It was just too much to do.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.678
And this was in the 60s.

05:32.698 --> 05:33.599
This was in the 60s.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.968
And so there was all this discussion about, well, since we didn't have the ability to convert the whole catalog, how would we do it?

05:42.008 --> 05:50.256
Would we do certain subject areas, or would we do the most used books, which would be a weird thing?

05:50.716 --> 05:53.860
Or should we do... But that theory's still in play in many places, though.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.282
Well, as far as catalogs are concerned,

05:56.988 --> 06:02.413
If Harvard can convert its entire catalog, anyone can convert its entire catalog.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.434
Sure, 2.1 million books at the last census.

06:04.454 --> 06:04.655
Right.

06:05.055 --> 06:17.285
So, you know, that feeling of not being able to do it because it's too large a task, just with the changes in technology and improvements, it just went down the tubes.

06:17.325 --> 06:18.306
It's no longer an issue.

06:18.967 --> 06:21.489
I'm convinced that the same thing's going to happen with full text.

06:21.929 --> 06:22.250
Really?

06:22.450 --> 06:23.070
Yeah.

06:23.691 --> 06:26.353
Over a longer period of time, because it is a bigger problem,

06:27.211 --> 06:30.394
Well, you think there will come a point where every text will be digitized?

06:33.718 --> 06:35.039
Yeah, I think so.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.661
Or, yes.

06:37.141 --> 06:37.382
Really?

06:38.022 --> 06:38.963
Or at least imaged.

06:39.003 --> 06:41.946
And then what's going to happen to the hardcovers?

06:42.267 --> 06:52.037
Well, I think there will still be hardcover, and maybe I'm just being, you know, a perennial optimist here, but it's still much easier to read a book than it is to read a screen.

06:52.372 --> 06:55.336
And that's why I make the distinction that it's made of Star Trek.

06:55.376 --> 06:57.539
Sure, but that didn't save the newspaper itself.

06:57.840 --> 07:08.795
That attitude, not that I'm agreeing with Baker here, I mean, I don't think you can keep every newspaper that's ever been printed, but that attitude still didn't prevail.

07:08.815 --> 07:19.449
I mean, the cost element here in the storage thing, people are going to see that you can put a whole library into a computer.

07:20.411 --> 07:22.193
Well, partly it's going to be market-driven.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.806
And industry-driven.

07:26.967 --> 07:41.283
And once the industry does, you know, turns a corner and does even more and more that's, as we call it, born electronic, you know, at some point there's going to be more going back.

07:41.323 --> 07:42.284
Do you know Kevin Guthrie?

07:42.625 --> 07:43.486
I've interviewed him.

07:43.506 --> 07:43.646
Yeah.

07:43.686 --> 07:44.567
He'll be in the next book.

07:44.767 --> 07:45.067
Yeah.

07:45.328 --> 07:45.648
The same book.

07:45.668 --> 07:48.231
He's a good friend.

07:49.004 --> 07:49.785
It's a pretty fun book.

07:49.925 --> 07:52.248
I think I'm talking to the right people, but I just think so.

07:52.268 --> 07:53.169
Oh, it sounds that way, yeah.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.552
Yeah, so go ahead.

07:55.572 --> 08:06.084
So he's, JSTOR is a good example of probably the first effort to really go back and do from the beginning of core material.

08:06.825 --> 08:10.890
And it's not hypertext.

08:10.910 --> 08:12.492
It's actually the regular page.

08:13.292 --> 08:13.753
It's both.

08:14.434 --> 08:15.055
It's both now?

08:15.115 --> 08:18.859
Yeah, it's both full-text searchable and image.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.679
But I still don't like to read it on the screen.

08:22.699 --> 08:24.421
No, no.

08:24.441 --> 08:30.671
And I can't imagine, but I think that's just my own 20th and 21st century outlook on life.

08:31.111 --> 08:35.578
I can't imagine being comfortable reading on a screen.

08:36.740 --> 08:40.646
But I suspect that if you asked a six- or seven-year-old, you'd get a different answer.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.369
Read that article.

08:42.409 --> 08:45.594
The assumption is that, oh, they're too busy to go to the library.

08:46.114 --> 08:49.099
Such a bore, you know, to go and take the book out and to read it.

08:50.193 --> 08:55.297
It's, uh, they'd much rather get the text, and then when you have to get the book, a machine's gonna get it for you.

08:56.819 --> 08:58.480
Something's wrong there, but... Yeah.

08:58.981 --> 09:00.622
And I've got two daughters, both in college.

09:02.023 --> 09:05.746
Nothing amazes me more than to see them sit up there.

09:05.766 --> 09:10.090
I feel like I'm talking to them, but I'm not, but we're talking to them.

09:10.110 --> 09:13.593
You know, we're IMing, you know, this instant messaging thing.

09:13.613 --> 09:13.753
Mm-hmm.

09:13.773 --> 09:15.455
And so Nicole will be doing her homework.

09:16.315 --> 09:19.238
I know she's got her earphones on, listening to her music.

09:19.505 --> 09:23.249
She's doing her homework, she's listening to music, and she's carrying on a conversation with me.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.072
I mean, that's multitasking.

09:27.173 --> 09:28.354
If I'm reading, I'm reading.

09:28.374 --> 09:35.222
If I'm working, as much as I love music, it is a distraction to me.

09:35.282 --> 09:36.283
I don't know about yourself.

09:36.303 --> 09:40.547
I mean, if you're trying to do some very serious writing, do you have music on in the background?

09:40.567 --> 09:41.168
I can't do that.

09:41.288 --> 09:41.568
I don't now.

09:42.489 --> 09:45.252
But when you were a kid, didn't you study with music on?

09:45.853 --> 09:46.153
I did.

09:46.606 --> 09:50.691
And so we wanted to avoid, you know, to escape doing what had to be done.

09:50.731 --> 09:53.395
But exactly, of course we did.

09:53.415 --> 09:59.883
And we did call our friends and talk on the telephone and, you know, click the phone like this and whatever you're doing.

10:01.065 --> 10:06.672
But it's a fascinating, and who knows?

10:06.832 --> 10:08.795
As a final analysis, who knows?

10:08.935 --> 10:11.939
I have to say, I went to the University of Arizona a couple months ago.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.582
I went down there to get a brand new building.

10:14.602 --> 10:15.043
Fabulous.

10:15.547 --> 10:17.849
I mean, even the benches outside are wired.

10:17.969 --> 10:24.094
You can go out with your laptop, sit outside, and you can plug into the bench.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.898
And they call it the information comment.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.159
They even call it a library.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.621
But you know what?

10:31.641 --> 10:32.762
I was there during term.

10:32.862 --> 10:41.530
It was mobbed, and it was mobbed, and it was the social center, and they had little things going on over here, and kids were, they had little areas where they were in there doing this.

10:42.470 --> 10:44.372
And then I went over to the library, and I was like,

10:44.588 --> 10:47.551
But, you know, where the books are.

10:49.353 --> 10:55.399
I was very, I was down a little bit, because I said, I said, please assure me.

10:55.439 --> 10:56.740
I said, are the kids using the books?

10:57.401 --> 10:59.202
They said, oh, yeah, they're using the books.

11:00.724 --> 11:02.446
You wouldn't be kidding me.

11:02.546 --> 11:04.067
I mean, they are using the books.

11:04.307 --> 11:06.930
Everything's not going on over there, I hope.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.171
I said, they were using the books.

11:08.191 --> 11:10.213
Who's responsible for the information commons?

11:10.353 --> 11:12.836
Is it the library, or is it the computer center?

11:13.016 --> 11:14.157
It's part of the library.

11:14.491 --> 11:15.092
Oh, that's good.

11:15.372 --> 11:17.374
But it's physically separate.

11:17.394 --> 11:17.994
That's too bad.

11:18.314 --> 11:19.435
No, it's connected.

11:19.535 --> 11:27.642
It's just they built their joins, but it's a different building, and you kind of walk through a courtyard, and you go, but they're not the same building.

11:29.224 --> 11:38.932
But the fellow who was walking me around was the guy who raised money for, and he works for a library, so I have to ask a question, but I do believe it's all under one umbrella.

11:38.952 --> 11:39.192
Yeah.

11:39.653 --> 11:39.973
I think.

11:39.993 --> 11:42.275
But it was very impressive.

11:42.295 --> 11:42.976
What can I say?

11:43.316 --> 11:44.397
Well, at Georgetown, we just

11:44.832 --> 11:58.949
took the former audio-visual department and renovated it with a gift from an alumnus, and put together the former multimedia center, the computing center, the AV stuff.

12:00.070 --> 12:11.243
We upgraded it with closed carols where you can do music, you can perform, you can compose, all that kind of thing.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.865
It's constantly occupied.

12:13.081 --> 12:18.649
But it's right there in the middle of the library, so the library's getting a lot of use, too.

12:22.174 --> 12:25.058
You probably have a CV that you can email me or something like that.

12:25.098 --> 12:25.418
Oh, yes.

12:25.438 --> 12:32.008
You shouldn't have to go through the whole thing, but just, if you could ... You said you went to library school, and where did you go to library?

12:32.068 --> 12:32.789
I went to Simmons.

12:32.869 --> 12:33.890
You went to Simmons.

12:33.910 --> 12:35.713
The only library school in New England at the time.

12:36.394 --> 12:40.219
I worked at Harvard for ten years, most of the time in the systems office.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.373
And then I went to Berkeley as head of the library systems office.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.876
I worked for Dick Doherty, if you know him.

12:45.896 --> 12:48.700
He used to be University of Michigan.

12:50.742 --> 12:54.908
Then I was hired by Hopkins to be the director of the library.

12:55.449 --> 12:56.530
I was there for nine years.

12:57.131 --> 13:04.320
I went to the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science as the executive director for two years, which was enough.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.383
I'm glad I did it, and I'm glad I left.

13:07.584 --> 13:10.408
Working for the government was difficult.

13:10.760 --> 13:13.062
And then I went to Georgetown, and I was there for 11 years.

13:13.102 --> 13:13.182
Wow.

13:13.362 --> 13:16.505
And so now you're a consultant.

13:16.905 --> 13:17.606
I'm a consultant.

13:17.626 --> 13:19.868
And what does a consultant do?

13:19.888 --> 13:21.149
I do all kinds of things.

13:21.289 --> 13:22.970
I write.

13:23.451 --> 13:27.514
I just did a consulting job for WACO, the Worcester Area Cooperating Libraries.

13:28.335 --> 13:29.256
I teach.

13:29.336 --> 13:33.419
I taught academic librarianship at Simmons this past semester.

13:33.439 --> 13:40.345
I consult on development, because I did a lot of fundraising at both Hopkins and Georgetown.

13:40.730 --> 13:50.459
I'm actually trying to not work quite that much, because I'm having so much fun doing other things.

13:50.679 --> 13:56.605
I'm being a member of the Sweet Adelines Chorus that's local here, and being involved with the public library.

13:57.586 --> 14:08.256
I'm also doing some work for an organization that's headquartered at Kent State that is a consortium of programs of teacher education for the deaf.

14:08.489 --> 14:10.311
And they have a three-year government grant.

14:10.351 --> 14:15.917
They're approaching their third year, and they're trying to figure out where they're going to get funding for in the future.

14:16.337 --> 14:18.980
And so that's development.

14:19.480 --> 14:33.855
And in fact, I'm doing my last couple of days of work for them just this week, helping them identify foundations where they might reasonably have a chance of getting at least a hearing.

14:34.426 --> 14:36.828
when they approach them with what their program is.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.210
But what do you hear out there?

14:40.131 --> 14:47.318
And this is almost becoming a tedious exercise, this debate.

14:47.338 --> 14:48.619
But what do you hear about the books?

14:48.700 --> 15:01.412
I mean, is it...it's no longer the people...is it a smart thing to say that the book is going to be replaced totally by the electronic stuff?

15:01.612 --> 15:03.994
But you can see where people are going.

15:05.273 --> 15:12.402
Yeah, but anybody who says that books are going to be replaced, I consider, frankly, a little bit naive.

15:12.422 --> 15:18.229
Right, and I have a chapter in my book, Patients and Fortitude, which I call In the Facts, and it's about academic libraries.

15:18.509 --> 15:31.224
And while I state flat out that the best colleges and universities today, the finest, we can make this as a statement, one of the factors that go into this recognition is the fact that they have extraordinarily good libraries.

15:31.745 --> 15:31.945
Right.

15:32.185 --> 15:33.627
And collections of depth.

15:33.893 --> 15:40.681
not only size, liberal arts colleges, as well as university graduate programs.

15:40.962 --> 15:41.122
Right.

15:41.522 --> 15:41.863
Flat out.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.224
And then look at Duke.

15:43.485 --> 15:48.030
That thing I have in there about Duke trying to raise their ARL ranking just a little bit.

15:48.050 --> 15:48.971
How is this going to help us?

15:49.011 --> 15:52.776
What kind of outweigh are we going to need to catch whomever, you know?

15:52.796 --> 15:53.897
That's right.

15:54.118 --> 15:54.919
And B.C.

15:55.479 --> 15:56.280
to get into.

15:56.300 --> 15:56.401
B.C.

15:56.421 --> 15:56.761
to get into.

15:56.901 --> 15:58.002
I wrote it, but I have it.

15:58.023 --> 15:58.323
G.W.

15:58.383 --> 15:59.304
Same thing.

15:59.344 --> 15:59.504
G.W.

15:59.524 --> 16:00.966
to get into that.

16:00.986 --> 16:01.467
Last year.

16:01.487 --> 16:01.707
Good.

16:01.855 --> 16:03.617
University of Louisville just got in.

16:03.877 --> 16:05.659
I suspect that they went through the same process.

16:06.380 --> 16:10.865
I've never been on that committee, but I know that it's a very lengthy process.

16:10.905 --> 16:13.347
So that's not reversing in any way, is it?

16:14.949 --> 16:23.598
No, partly because ARL, as the leader, has not yet found a way to measure, and measurement is how you compare.

16:24.499 --> 16:29.685
They haven't found a way to measure the quality, measure quality rather than quantity.

16:30.205 --> 16:58.390
we've been talking about it i was on the statistics committee for quite a number of years and there are clearly ways in which you can do it and remember title 2c it was a department of education program that was designed to support research collections that's back that's a long time ago 60s 70s oh no it was more recent than that i think it started probably started in the 70s 70s but it didn't stop until the mid 90s they gave them money to go out and get books

16:58.775 --> 17:01.738
Or to provide access.

17:01.799 --> 17:05.243
So they would give money for conversion of catalogs at one point in time.

17:05.283 --> 17:06.184
That was real bad.

17:06.204 --> 17:09.468
And then it moved more towards preservation, just as NEH did.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.031
But they had a very nice way.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.493
They would only give to research libraries.

17:14.513 --> 17:27.769
And they had a few questions there to determine researchness, which involved things like, to what extent the library was used by people other than your own community.

17:28.778 --> 17:31.061
You mean your academic community?

17:31.101 --> 17:31.421
Yeah.

17:31.761 --> 17:39.971
How much it was used by others outside, people from other universities, people from other countries, universities from other countries.

17:42.053 --> 17:52.185
What kinds of research, what kind of publications were produced as a result primarily of, or in large part, of research in your collection?

17:52.545 --> 17:53.186
Interesting.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.988
Yeah, it is.

17:55.373 --> 18:01.720
sort of leading in the right direction of quantity, I mean, quality rather than quantity, but we haven't yet been able to.

18:02.020 --> 18:05.504
Yeah, Duane talks about that in that chapter that I have.

18:05.524 --> 18:17.136
If you have a chance to read that chapter, I think you'll like that, because it really is an academic library, and again, people that you know talking about this stuff in there.

18:17.536 --> 18:21.280
What was, let's just talk a little bit about Ruth Baker.

18:21.648 --> 18:24.671
your reaction when that book came out last.

18:24.691 --> 18:29.957
I mean, just say anything you want, you know, and I'm looking for controversy.

18:29.997 --> 18:35.924
I'm really not going to do a great takeout on this thing, but I do have to address this.

18:35.944 --> 18:43.292
I guess what upset me, what offended me, really, about that is this demonization of librarians.

18:43.893 --> 18:46.235
These are the most accommodating people in the world.

18:46.816 --> 18:48.378
To make them the enemy is absurd.

18:48.658 --> 18:50.440
You know, to make fun of...

18:50.943 --> 18:55.549
Not Bellington, but his predecessor, Borsington, with bow ties, you know.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.714
I mean, this is ... And he's not even a librarian.

18:58.814 --> 19:00.917
And he's not even a librarian, that's right.

19:00.937 --> 19:02.639
And neither is Bellington.

19:02.659 --> 19:03.701
That's right, yeah.

19:04.141 --> 19:09.489
You know, and ... But anyway, why don't we enter the conversation on that a little bit?

19:09.509 --> 19:13.555
Well, the first thing is to be insulted by it, for exactly that reason.

19:14.896 --> 19:15.517
For which reason?

19:15.537 --> 19:16.639
Well, why don't you articulate it?

19:16.679 --> 19:18.942
Being insulted as a librarian.

19:20.018 --> 19:31.390
because I'm being accused of doing something that sounds professionally reprehensible, but in fact, it just makes good sense.

19:31.611 --> 19:41.081
I mean, when we lived in California, we started subscribing to the Chronicle of Higher Education, and my husband would pile up the issues.

19:42.322 --> 19:49.570
This is the year that I was in Maryland, and he still had to stay in California for a year, and I would come

19:50.157 --> 20:05.579
back to California once a month, and I'd look at this pile, and you could see the color, not only grown, but you could see the colors, and you could see the gradual shading from the white newspaper color at the top down to sort of orange at the bottom.

20:05.659 --> 20:06.981
It's like an archaeological site.

20:07.301 --> 20:07.661
Yeah.

20:07.742 --> 20:14.291
Well, you just knew that over a period of a very short number of weeks, this paper is just not credible any longer.

20:14.431 --> 20:15.472
It's fragile.

20:15.893 --> 20:16.734
It just disappeared.

20:17.135 --> 20:18.096
So there's a need.

20:18.116 --> 20:18.797
If you're going to have

20:19.385 --> 20:22.729
The content, you have to replace it with something.

20:22.910 --> 20:37.449
You have to reformat it, or either have it in microform, which everybody hates, but we know is a durable medium, or electronics, which still, it's presumably durable, but it has... It has to be migrated.

20:37.850 --> 20:38.591
Yeah, that's the problem.

20:38.611 --> 20:40.173
Somebody has to be, oh, we get the switch.

20:40.333 --> 20:40.934
That's right.

20:41.214 --> 20:41.455
Yeah.

20:42.736 --> 20:44.699
So, you know, that's... It hasn't been resolved.

20:45.100 --> 20:45.460
That's right.

20:47.515 --> 20:53.102
migration, emulation, which way are we going, but when you see exactly what they've done, they don't have it.

20:53.122 --> 20:54.784
They haven't figured it out yet, have they?

20:54.945 --> 20:55.105
No.

20:55.165 --> 20:56.106
Not by a long shot.

20:56.246 --> 20:56.467
Right.

20:57.688 --> 21:17.033
They will, I suspect, I hope so, but when you think of the durability of the carrier here, we are in jeopardy of losing so much stuff, aren't we, because of the, maybe you disagree with that, but... No, my dissertation was on eight-inch floppy.

21:17.789 --> 21:18.350
No kidding.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.993
But then, of course, it was printed out.

21:20.233 --> 21:20.473
Right.

21:20.634 --> 21:21.114
And bound.

21:22.256 --> 21:24.560
So I can no longer read the eight-inch floppies.

21:25.401 --> 21:28.787
But if I had to, I could scan a copy.

21:29.267 --> 21:30.409
An OCR is wonderful.

21:30.770 --> 21:31.150
It works.

21:32.733 --> 21:32.833
Yeah.

21:32.853 --> 21:36.659
Well, my first book was written literally ten years ago.

21:36.679 --> 21:38.843
I mean, it's a five-inch floppies.

21:38.863 --> 21:39.003
Mm-hmm.

21:39.023 --> 21:41.126
And I try and find out.

21:41.146 --> 21:44.792
I still have an old computer, but precisely that reason, because I have a lot of results.

21:46.325 --> 21:59.400
disks that I may want to look at at some point, and all my interviews, and I never did migrate them over to the smaller disks, but all the transcripts of all my interviews I have are stored on the logic, you know.

21:59.541 --> 22:03.725
See, I wonder if the old computer can accommodate a zip line.

22:03.745 --> 22:04.867
No way.

22:04.887 --> 22:05.247
Oh.

22:05.267 --> 22:05.828
No way.

22:05.888 --> 22:07.530
It's only 25 milliseconds.

22:07.930 --> 22:08.091
Oh.

22:09.252 --> 22:09.993
It's really old.

22:10.013 --> 22:12.075
Well, I'm very sentimental.

22:12.115 --> 22:16.180
I mean, you know, I've written two books on this.

22:16.683 --> 22:20.688
I'm not going to get rid of it.

22:20.968 --> 22:22.230
I love manual typewriters.

22:22.731 --> 22:23.391
What can I say?

22:23.932 --> 22:24.693
My husband does too.

22:25.754 --> 22:27.577
I've been getting them on eBay.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.119
My wife says, no, I'm a typewriter.

22:30.781 --> 22:32.002
You must have a large house too.

22:32.483 --> 22:33.804
You don't have a large house.

22:34.005 --> 22:38.971
I want to keep it downstairs in my basement where I work, my little museum of typewriters.

22:39.612 --> 22:40.453
I love them.

22:40.473 --> 22:44.698
You don't have to put a piece of paper in it and you type it enough to set up the format.

22:45.353 --> 22:50.419
create a file, I can put an envelope in there or a memo thing and type it up, you know.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.483
There are advantages to simplicity.

22:53.904 --> 23:03.536
We have my father's old typewriter, probably from the 1920s, when he lived in Germany, and of course it has the German keyboard on it, which has the Z in a much more prominent place.

23:04.197 --> 23:06.500
So you can't do the QWERTY, G-E-R-T-Y.

23:06.780 --> 23:14.230
There's only a couple of letters that switch around, and the Z, I can't remember what it replaces, but there's

23:14.581 --> 23:18.385
There's a letter that we use a lot that German doesn't use much.

23:19.826 --> 23:21.127
I just don't remember which one it is.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.209
But, yeah, it's nice.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.452
Let's go back to Baker.

23:27.053 --> 23:38.464
So, it's partly just the insult that it was insulting, and I think it's not true, what he's saying about librarians and their motivation.

23:38.484 --> 23:44.470
Well, he actually down there alleges

23:44.939 --> 23:46.360
A conspiracy, you know.

23:46.380 --> 23:49.443
I mean, I don't think he uses that phrase.

23:49.463 --> 23:51.986
He's denied that he's making that statement.

23:52.006 --> 23:53.407
But, you know, I've been to Leipzig.

23:54.008 --> 23:54.729
He hasn't been.

23:54.949 --> 23:57.832
I've walked in there, and I spent a day there.

23:58.732 --> 24:03.457
I see the books that come in, that they do the page splitting on, and the mass deacidism.

24:03.477 --> 24:04.838
You can pick up these books.

24:05.499 --> 24:06.981
They will fall apart in your hand.

24:07.021 --> 24:10.424
You can't tell me that these books are not in need of some attention.

24:10.684 --> 24:11.125
Absolutely.

24:11.445 --> 24:14.608
And, you know, Ken Carpenter, I quote him, we're walking through Widener one day.

24:15.027 --> 24:16.869
And, of course, it's that intoxicating smell.

24:17.530 --> 24:20.012
Anybody who loves books, it's like ambrosia, you know.

24:21.333 --> 24:25.317
And Ken says, I quite agree with you, it is intoxicating.

24:25.337 --> 24:27.379
He says, well, what you smell is decaying books.

24:28.641 --> 24:36.829
That's what you smell when you walk into a big library, and that one, that smell that we all like is, well, what you are smelling, that's the smell of books decaying.

24:37.109 --> 24:37.409
Right.

24:38.330 --> 24:41.153
Now, maybe he's wrong on that, but I don't think he is.

24:41.193 --> 24:42.975
No, no, I don't think he's wrong.

24:43.394 --> 24:49.902
I think Baker's problem, another part of his problem, is that he is, well, he's misleading people.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.967
As I mentioned, as I said, he's being naive.

24:55.068 --> 24:56.069
And, you know, it's obvious.

24:56.089 --> 25:06.782
He's making statements about something that he thinks he knows something about, but he doesn't know quite enough to make truly expert statements.

25:08.444 --> 25:12.169
But they're sort of tantalizing, and so

25:12.368 --> 25:18.840
Publishers like to publish them, and people like to read them, and go, oh, boy, there may be a scandal here.

25:18.960 --> 25:29.559
Well, the newspapers really jumped onto this one, because, of course, what are the deal with the throwing away newspapers that document their own existence?

25:29.799 --> 25:31.903
I'm thinking now, why did the newspapers jump on this?

25:31.963 --> 25:32.685
And they're very naive.

25:33.005 --> 25:35.710
I thought the review of his book and the New York Times was

25:36.466 --> 25:39.450
not written by somebody who has any professional experience.

25:39.490 --> 25:41.492
And he was using, oh, Jesus.

25:41.512 --> 25:42.393
He said, I can't believe this.

25:42.413 --> 25:43.495
He said this on the review.

25:44.075 --> 25:45.117
I can't believe this.

25:45.137 --> 25:45.777
They're doing this?

25:46.739 --> 25:48.961
And he doesn't even question whether Baker's right or wrong.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.484
And he doesn't even question whether Baker's right or wrong.

25:52.345 --> 25:57.211
Baker's article in the New Yorker about card catalogs.

25:57.231 --> 25:57.412
Right.

25:58.072 --> 26:01.617
I read that, and I read it very, very thoroughly.

26:02.418 --> 26:05.882
I read the whole thing, and then I went back with a pen, and I underlined,

26:06.166 --> 26:13.356
every place that was either flat out wrong or significantly wrong or misleading.

26:13.997 --> 26:18.163
And the page was full of my pen marks.

26:18.183 --> 26:21.929
Can you think of a few things that are particularly egregious in your view?

26:21.949 --> 26:22.149
Oh, boy.

26:22.610 --> 26:26.756
Not so much the card catalog thing, but the double fold, the preservation.

26:27.857 --> 26:31.262
Well, the idea that you must.

26:32.255 --> 26:33.276
preserved.

26:33.436 --> 26:34.958
You know, these things have to be kept.

26:35.219 --> 26:42.268
It doesn't make sense to keep some, it's just what we just said, it doesn't make sense to keep something that's falling apart.

26:42.288 --> 26:51.779
Unless it has some iconic value, or some paratextual element that makes it, or association value, or if it's a last copy, or whatever.

26:52.040 --> 26:56.145
I mean, there have to be some scenarios where you would keep something, wouldn't you think?

26:56.365 --> 26:59.289
Well, perhaps, but then you'd probably better do something to it.

26:59.309 --> 27:01.772
And if it's so valuable, and so

27:01.972 --> 27:06.758
so much of an icon or whatever, there are ways of dealing with it.

27:06.778 --> 27:08.140
You can deacidify.

27:08.160 --> 27:08.961
They're all expensive.

27:09.502 --> 27:10.363
You can deacidify it.

27:11.405 --> 27:13.107
You can treat it page by page.

27:14.409 --> 27:21.598
You can encapsulate each page to make it both usable and to prevent further deterioration.

27:21.959 --> 27:23.721
I mean, there are all sorts of ways to deal with it.

27:24.302 --> 27:28.047
But the material that is commonplace

27:28.280 --> 27:47.659
that's not rare, it's widely held, it's widely reformatted, so you're not talking so much about the page of paper as making sure that you're able to get at the content at some point, including ads and classifieds and all those kinds of things, because you want to retain that content as well.

27:47.679 --> 27:58.270
I mean, it would be nice if you could, but people who publish or who create newsprint

27:58.722 --> 28:00.545
don't care that it contains acid.

28:01.286 --> 28:06.514
Maybe you should write a book about paper manufacturers instead.

28:06.554 --> 28:09.479
Well, he opens up his newspapers, and he says, look at this.

28:09.499 --> 28:11.181
These are fantastic.

28:11.201 --> 28:11.963
They haven't degraded.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.186
These are the British Library.

28:14.206 --> 28:15.869
Well, probably they've never been used either.

28:16.049 --> 28:18.172
I don't know what the situation is.

28:18.192 --> 28:27.126
But that was probably a mistake on their part, the British Library, to get rid of some of those newspapers.

28:27.983 --> 28:37.837
They had the full runs of newspapers that really, New York Journal Tribune and Chicago Tribune copies.

28:38.177 --> 28:38.438
I don't know.

28:38.458 --> 28:38.658
Yeah.

28:38.678 --> 28:39.980
Well, they have a space bill.

28:41.602 --> 28:43.284
And I assume that they have a microfilm.

28:43.825 --> 28:47.250
So they are able to offer the content.

28:47.951 --> 28:54.380
And I assume that those weren't last runs, that somebody's got a full run of the hard copy.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.843
Well, that's not necessarily a

28:57.920 --> 29:03.668
Even the New York Times, you know, doesn't keep archival copies of their own newspaper.

29:03.848 --> 29:05.771
That amazes me.

29:05.851 --> 29:11.259
I had that, and he actually had that in his book, too.

29:11.279 --> 29:23.096
And they have a microfilm copy, but even the microfilm copies don't do color, so they've been using color now for four or five years, so there's no color copy of the source.

29:23.296 --> 29:25.039
They could use color microphones.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.522
Well, Emma, it doesn't...

29:28.345 --> 29:30.548
It's not all that reliable, was it, because there's a color.

29:31.009 --> 29:31.530
Yeah.

29:31.550 --> 29:33.893
I don't know.

29:34.054 --> 29:41.264
To me, newspapers, I guess, it would be nice if there were one copy someplace.

29:42.767 --> 29:43.207
Mm-hmm.

29:43.227 --> 29:45.290
You know, a J-Store says that they do that, too.

29:45.411 --> 29:50.138
If it's a last copy, they send it out to Chicago, you know, to that... CRL.

29:50.678 --> 29:52.101
CRL, which is a fabulous place.

29:52.121 --> 29:53.923
They write about that.

29:53.943 --> 29:55.045
That's become a rare...

29:55.480 --> 29:59.404
It's become a collection of rare things by default.

29:59.424 --> 30:00.925
It's stuff that people have disguised.

30:00.965 --> 30:01.386
That's right.

30:01.486 --> 30:03.428
And that nobody else has except them.

30:04.108 --> 30:05.570
But that's not really by default.

30:05.590 --> 30:06.410
That's by intention.

30:06.731 --> 30:09.714
The problem is that it's expensive to maintain.

30:10.434 --> 30:18.582
And when I was at Hopkins, we were a member of CRL, and it cost us over $20,000 a year.

30:20.023 --> 30:21.084
And I cost it out.

30:22.386 --> 30:23.867
We used it very rarely.

30:24.185 --> 30:34.997
And so the question is, how much are you paying to be able to tell your faculty members that they can have access, if they ever need it, to these things that you don't want to or can't get?

30:35.878 --> 30:42.385
And in a time of economic constraint, that's one of the things that can go.

30:42.565 --> 30:43.486
And I dropped out.

30:43.526 --> 30:51.255
Once my provost, who was on the board for a short while, he said, no, you can't drop out until after I'm on the board.

30:52.147 --> 30:55.452
So his term ended, and then I dropped out.

30:55.472 --> 30:55.632
Yeah.

30:57.194 --> 31:06.568
So I haven't had a chance to read this yet, but my sense is that he certainly is mounting a point-by-point rebuttal to Baker.

31:07.169 --> 31:18.065
And I actually was doing, I found out about it, I was doing an Amazon search for Baker's book, which I have, but I wanted some bibliographical information on it.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.587
And I came up with two double-pulls.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.850
I said, okay, it's there.

31:22.302 --> 31:24.404
was this book, which is coming out in August.

31:24.444 --> 31:25.285
Have you read about this?

31:25.406 --> 31:25.906
No, I haven't.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.388
Meanwhile, you can take a quick look at it.

31:27.408 --> 31:31.312
And I contacted him, and I said, look, I'd like to get this in my new book.

31:31.332 --> 31:33.595
And he said, well, I'll have the publisher send you a set of the galleys.

31:33.615 --> 31:34.816
But those are the unbound galleys.

31:35.878 --> 31:40.823
And he's got a great bibliography in there, in fact, I have to say.

31:44.908 --> 31:49.373
But he seems to have assumed the position as the...

31:50.332 --> 31:58.200
a foil to Baker and this whole running dialogue.

31:59.241 --> 32:00.502
What is he again?

32:00.542 --> 32:00.902
Cox.

32:01.022 --> 32:04.586
He was at the library school at Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh.

32:04.706 --> 32:04.846
Okay.

32:04.866 --> 32:08.149
He was the guy that they had in a debate at Civitts last year.

32:08.270 --> 32:08.810
Right.

32:08.830 --> 32:10.612
And Winston Tabb was there, by the way.

32:10.632 --> 32:17.959
And he, at the very end, yeah, and he brought up something, and he spoke at length about the Library of Congress.

32:18.698 --> 32:23.643
And I have my tape recorder running in half, so I have this on tape at home.

32:24.784 --> 32:27.147
And I haven't had it, I haven't transcribed it yet.

32:28.948 --> 32:34.314
But this is coming out in August from Greenwood in Connecticut.

32:34.334 --> 32:35.735
Yeah.

32:35.755 --> 32:37.557
It seemed that everything should be saved.

32:38.158 --> 32:47.187
And, you know, he says here that that's an argument that has found resonance with the media and the public, but I wonder how long it will

32:47.858 --> 32:56.809
have resonance with the media and the public, because everybody is exposed immediately when you start using the internet to a system in which everything is saved.

32:57.330 --> 33:03.037
Well, not everything, because things get lost, too, but you run across so much junk.

33:03.057 --> 33:05.741
Do a search for something and get 157,000 hits.

33:06.001 --> 33:06.822
Yeah.

33:08.344 --> 33:09.946
Well, now you're searching.

33:09.966 --> 33:16.174
You're looking for the salient ones, and you have to start wading through all this trash there, you know.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.275
It would be kind of nice to get the

33:17.440 --> 33:19.042
15 that you're looking for.

33:19.443 --> 33:22.507
Yeah, that's right.

33:22.787 --> 33:24.830
But, you know, Tom Tanzel is, right?

33:24.850 --> 33:26.632
He's at the Guggenheim.

33:26.653 --> 33:26.833
Right.

33:28.835 --> 33:44.697
But he's one of the great proponents of saving everything, even multiple paperbacks with different colored dust jackets, because these are different states of the same dust jackets, or different states of the same publication.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.611
It depends.

33:46.691 --> 33:52.176
I mean, I guess the thing is that there is such a thing as too simplistic an argument.

33:52.196 --> 34:00.644
And that last example, from my perspective as director of the library, I wouldn't agree with that.

34:00.964 --> 34:13.115
You don't save everything and not every copy, unless it's an area within which my special collections department has a special scope, special expertise.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.937
And then, yeah, you do want to save everything.

34:15.288 --> 34:22.678
When I think about my personal collection of science fiction, I probably want to save the different dust jackets.

34:23.079 --> 34:26.103
But you're attacking as a bibliophile, not a librarian.

34:26.143 --> 34:26.804
That's right.

34:26.824 --> 34:30.188
And there are two different sets of standards that apply here, right?

34:30.328 --> 34:38.199
But that's why I'm saying it's too simple just to say, flat out, everything should be saved, under all circumstances, anywhere.

34:39.240 --> 34:39.781
You see what I mean?

34:40.562 --> 34:41.383
Yeah, it can't.

34:42.184 --> 34:44.147
I mean, even a library that has to

34:45.072 --> 34:51.779
or that wants to support an academic community and therefore considers its collection one of record.

34:52.339 --> 35:09.477
And most of us who are involved in academic libraries consider ourselves collections of record, and therefore we eliminate as little as possible in the interest of giving our community as broad an exposure to the collection or to the work.

35:09.659 --> 35:12.642
Put it within your area of expertise, of course.

35:12.662 --> 35:15.625
That's one of the Farmington Plan was a great idea, I think.

35:15.645 --> 35:16.727
Did it divide?

35:17.407 --> 35:23.133
Certainly gave people the attitude that I'll specialize in this, and you specialize in that, and maybe we'll have some overlap.

35:23.153 --> 35:31.162
Undoubtedly we'll have some overlap, but at least your area of specialty will be something that you're going to collect in great depth.

35:31.182 --> 35:39.531
The problem arises when you get things that no one is paying attention to, at least in a certain period of time.

35:39.815 --> 35:46.323
I remember when I was at Hopkins, we were a member of RLG and the research libraries group.

35:47.004 --> 35:51.950
And we were trying, there were only 35 institutions that were members at the time.

35:52.331 --> 36:05.908
We were trying to divide up our collection so that every area of knowledge would have at least one library collecting and being responsible for making sure that everything was acquired, collected, and made available.

36:07.009 --> 36:09.332
And the University of Michigan had

36:09.548 --> 36:15.354
a sizable Turkish collection, but it wasn't a priority at that time anymore.

36:15.955 --> 36:21.901
They had the collection, they weren't going to do away with it, but they weren't really putting a whole lot of effort into it any longer.

36:22.362 --> 36:34.514
And when Dick Doherty was faced with the proposition that Michigan be made responsible for acquiring, cataloging, and making available everything in Turkish, he revolted.

36:34.615 --> 36:36.957
He said, no, I'm not going to do this.

36:37.426 --> 36:41.190
They probably didn't have any interest on campus for it, either, right?

36:41.210 --> 36:41.510
That's right.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.474
Maybe they didn't even have a curriculum that supported it.

36:45.334 --> 36:45.475
Mm-hmm.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.718
Must have at one time, or probably had at one time, but no longer.

36:48.738 --> 36:50.740
Well, the professor probably died, or retired.

36:50.920 --> 36:51.461
That's right.

36:51.481 --> 36:54.865
I mean, there was probably a Department of One, you know, a person who taught this.

36:55.065 --> 36:55.946
Yeah.

36:56.727 --> 36:58.929
Had a moderate following, but he's gone now.

36:59.169 --> 37:01.612
Because this happens a lot, I see, at schools.

37:01.632 --> 37:04.615
It'll be some professor that has started a collection.

37:04.983 --> 37:16.597
They've built around him or her, as the case may be, and then this person retires or whatever, and now this course is no longer, especially at the Liberal Arts, like Oberlin, I'm thinking of Lady English.

37:17.257 --> 37:18.439
I forget what the collection was.

37:18.459 --> 37:20.361
They had a really terrific collection.

37:20.381 --> 37:22.223
They put it together, and then the guy retired.

37:22.644 --> 37:24.826
Now there is no more, what are we going to do with all these books?

37:25.267 --> 37:31.054
Well, maybe somebody will come back and teach this, but what they did is they found another school that could use it.

37:32.836 --> 37:34.838
Oh, that's an interesting way to deal with the problem.

37:35.797 --> 37:36.458
I think it is.

37:37.219 --> 37:39.342
You know Bill Gosling at the University of Michigan?

37:39.362 --> 37:39.462
Sure.

37:39.482 --> 37:41.565
Well, he and I went to Bates together with classmates.

37:41.585 --> 37:42.086
Oh, really?

37:43.127 --> 37:43.548
That's great.

37:43.568 --> 37:48.415
And so I spent a little time with him last week, and he invited me out to speak.

37:49.757 --> 37:53.041
But they had an exhibition, fabulous exhibition.

37:53.101 --> 37:59.270
It just opened last week, and it's their Netherlands Dutch Books Art.

37:59.310 --> 38:04.217
So they've got a fabulous collection of Dutch things from the earliest.

38:04.737 --> 38:07.421
days of print, you know, all the way through.

38:07.441 --> 38:24.687
And then they had one item there on display, but it was representative of a collection of 1,800 books, which had just been given to them, gratis, from the Catholic University, and I can't pronounce it, but it's N-I-G-M-E-G-E-A-N in the Netherlands.

38:24.767 --> 38:25.728
I'd never heard of it before.

38:26.590 --> 38:28.753
But these are 16th, 17th century books.

38:29.105 --> 38:31.268
I mean, some bindings, you can't believe them.

38:31.289 --> 38:34.494
But what they did is these were duplicates from their own collection.

38:34.894 --> 38:35.956
They didn't want to sell them.

38:35.976 --> 38:36.657
They insisted.

38:36.677 --> 38:38.620
They tried to find a match.

38:39.261 --> 38:43.428
And the provisional, the woman that's in charge of special collections, she's going to give me the whole story.

38:43.688 --> 38:46.493
I think it's a fabulous story of what you do with the collection.

38:46.974 --> 38:51.501
All right, we don't want to keep, we don't have space for these 1,800 books.

38:51.937 --> 38:57.122
Let's find somebody who wants them, who can use them, and they guarantee us that they will never sell them.

38:57.243 --> 38:58.043
They will never sell them.

38:58.123 --> 39:02.308
If they don't want them, then they have to do a similar kind of a thing, find another.

39:03.029 --> 39:09.996
Well, Bill said, you can't believe this stuff, because it's all just, what it is, it's not the great high spots, but it's the next level down.

39:10.236 --> 39:12.018
It's the stuff just beneath the high spots.

39:12.398 --> 39:16.763
It just adds such depth, and they have a fabulous collection in Michigan.

39:16.861 --> 39:17.882
And do they have a program?

39:18.343 --> 39:19.705
They have a fabulous program.

39:19.965 --> 39:23.109
I mean, I got a copy of the catalog.

39:23.129 --> 39:24.110
I mean, it's a little catalog.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.432
Somebody actually teaches Dutch.

39:25.812 --> 39:26.693
Somebody actually teaches Dutch.

39:26.713 --> 39:27.014
That's great.

39:27.034 --> 39:30.038
But apparently there are a lot of people out in that part of the world.

39:30.058 --> 39:33.082
You know, Michigan has a whole history of it there.

39:33.102 --> 39:38.208
I mean, they've been teaching it there for a long time, and have developed and built a major collection.

39:38.769 --> 39:40.851
I know that Harvard was one of them.

39:40.871 --> 39:42.213
Is that an interesting story?

39:42.453 --> 39:42.774
Yeah.

39:42.974 --> 39:43.695
Oh, yeah.

39:44.317 --> 39:46.980
New to my experience, and I said, gee, I wonder if there were any other cases.

39:47.241 --> 39:48.422
It's a fabulous story.

39:48.462 --> 39:50.325
I'm totally going to write it into the book.

39:50.645 --> 39:51.706
Yeah.

39:52.487 --> 39:54.930
It's not... I'm sure it has happened.

39:54.951 --> 39:55.671
It's happened.

39:56.573 --> 39:59.616
But I like the way... I like the narrative.

39:59.636 --> 40:01.799
I like the way they want to keep it together.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.762
They found an American university.

40:04.042 --> 40:05.244
They attached strings.

40:05.264 --> 40:06.946
The strings had nothing to do with money.

40:06.986 --> 40:09.149
They had everything to do with keeping it together as a collection.

40:09.369 --> 40:09.990
Yeah.

40:10.010 --> 40:12.653
If you find that it doesn't serve your purposes,

40:13.645 --> 40:17.330
then return them to us or find somebody else.

40:17.691 --> 40:26.184
Now, does that mean that they have to actually keep it physically together as a collection or just have a record of it so that if they got rid of it in the future?

40:26.204 --> 40:27.986
You can't sell it, apparently.

40:28.006 --> 40:29.849
They're adamant about selling.

40:30.170 --> 40:35.197
But they're not prescribing how you handle it within your, or how Michigan handles it.

40:35.477 --> 40:36.659
No, not at all.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.522
Because that's another issue, you know, of

40:38.705 --> 40:46.395
A benefactor will come along and say, I have this great collection, and I want to give it to you, but only if you put it in a room, keep it all together.

40:46.816 --> 40:48.979
Change the flowers every day, you know.

40:48.999 --> 40:49.219
Yes.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.363
And that's always a difficult problem for a library.

40:52.644 --> 40:58.672
But, you know, there are all kinds of ways of dealing with getting rid of— I mean, they exist, but they have fresh flowers.

40:58.692 --> 41:01.616
I mean, Mrs. Widener did that, didn't she, I think, at Harvard?

41:01.636 --> 41:02.497
Yeah, in the Widener Room.

41:02.517 --> 41:04.780
In the Widener Room, you know.

41:04.912 --> 41:07.094
the small thing, I suppose.

41:07.154 --> 41:08.736
Have you been there since the renovation?

41:08.756 --> 41:08.976
No.

41:09.257 --> 41:09.917
Oh, you should go.

41:09.957 --> 41:10.398
Take a look.

41:10.418 --> 41:10.758
I will.

41:11.059 --> 41:12.220
It's quite something.

41:12.821 --> 41:13.341
Well, I will.

41:13.361 --> 41:14.462
I'll take it.

41:14.482 --> 41:16.484
I have to be in Cambridge for a week or so, so I'll follow up.

41:16.505 --> 41:24.954
Well, it used to be the cataloging department, when you walk up the steps, and the cataloging department was over there, and I had a desk there for a year, is now the periodicals, right?

41:24.974 --> 41:26.936
And the catalogers were all in Central Square.

41:27.196 --> 41:27.556
Wow.

41:28.137 --> 41:32.402
And they apparently kicked up real fuss about it initially, and now they're quite happy.

41:33.603 --> 41:34.564
Here we are, I think.

41:35.827 --> 41:43.674
Oh, different ways of dealing with materials that you can't use any longer.

41:43.694 --> 41:49.199
It's either out of scope or you've gotten a gift and it's a duplicate or whatever.

41:49.219 --> 41:53.983
I mean, in Washington, we were quite fortunate because we were where all the embassies were.

41:54.463 --> 42:05.833
So one of the things that we could do was to either respond to pleas from embassies of other countries for materials or just go to them and say, yeah, would you like

42:06.168 --> 42:07.209
some of these materials.

42:08.311 --> 42:08.852
Oh, yeah.

42:08.912 --> 42:17.583
And as often as not, they'd take you up on it, and then they would pick them up, and they would pay for the shipping, and of course, that's all a big, it's a hassle.

42:17.704 --> 42:21.048
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

42:21.128 --> 42:27.737
And we didn't have to pay for it, because then the handling and the processing is also

42:28.139 --> 42:29.340
It's a burden.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.322
But just the cost to put one book on the shelf.

42:31.342 --> 42:32.283
I forget what it is.

42:32.303 --> 42:34.706
It's like 50 bucks, or I don't know what it is.

42:34.726 --> 42:41.353
Maybe more, but what it actually costs you to take the book, catalog it, and for the first time, it's not just the cost of the book.

42:42.334 --> 42:44.717
And then there's the cost of taking a book off the shelf.

42:45.898 --> 42:50.503
And what we had to do at Georgetown last year, we were running out of space.

42:50.763 --> 42:55.969
We had a handful of years left, and we either had to form

42:56.320 --> 43:07.131
a new unit that would be constantly identifying what should be weeded or what should be sent to storage, or make it a one-time mass project.

43:07.271 --> 43:25.990
And I didn't have the wherewithal to put together a new unit, and so we did a one-time, one-year project in which we identified 150,000 books to be stored in the Washington Research Library Consortium headquarters out in Maryland.

43:26.729 --> 43:38.084
And there were another, I think, five or eight or nine thousand books that were duplicates that were identified to be discarded.

43:39.246 --> 43:53.185
Because another reason that a library discards books is because a professor ordered 15 copies to go on reserve when he was using it as a reserve textbook, and that course is no longer being taught.

43:53.645 --> 43:55.588
So you don't need 15 copies on a shelf.

43:56.149 --> 43:56.449
Sure.

43:56.733 --> 43:58.495
Maybe two.

43:58.515 --> 44:00.018
But at most.

44:00.078 --> 44:10.532
I mean, we are academic libraries tend to have one copy of a lot of titles, unlike public libraries, which have lots of copies of a smaller number of titles.

44:11.033 --> 44:17.162
And then when the title is no longer fashionable, maybe the whole thing goes away.

44:17.262 --> 44:17.963
Yeah.

44:18.023 --> 44:20.506
And Baker hasn't looked at that, has he?

44:20.526 --> 44:20.787
No.

44:20.907 --> 44:24.932
Has he talked about public libraries?

44:24.952 --> 44:25.373
I don't think so, no.

44:27.344 --> 44:28.385
I hope he doesn't target them.

44:28.505 --> 44:30.287
No, I think he's out of it now.

44:32.289 --> 44:36.212
I mean, I don't know what he's working on now.

44:36.633 --> 44:38.254
I don't know.

44:38.274 --> 44:42.218
But, you know, the whole preservation issue.

44:43.219 --> 44:46.602
I mean, you're absolutely right when you say librarians.

44:47.423 --> 44:52.127
Librarians are librarians not necessarily because they are constant readers.

44:52.148 --> 44:55.150
I mean, that's the wrong reason to go into the profession.

44:55.871 --> 44:56.912
But they do like books.

44:57.533 --> 44:58.814
Yeah.

44:58.834 --> 45:00.116
Yeah, I think so.

45:00.156 --> 45:01.417
And they like serving people.

45:01.437 --> 45:02.699
They at least like information.

45:05.602 --> 45:11.308
The only professionals in the world that I know of whose mandate is to help you, is to encourage you to borrow things.

45:13.210 --> 45:13.991
Yeah.

45:15.113 --> 45:16.794
And we trust you, you know, to return it.

45:17.635 --> 45:17.876
Yeah.

45:17.976 --> 45:18.276
Amazing.

45:18.296 --> 45:20.018
You know, how many people do that?

45:20.559 --> 45:21.039
That's true.

45:21.059 --> 45:23.642
And to find things, to really assist you with that.

45:25.951 --> 45:35.760
It was incredible to me that he would take on the library and to be involved in this hoax about these books.

45:36.060 --> 45:36.961
There were a million books.

45:37.021 --> 45:37.602
A million books.

45:38.503 --> 45:40.004
What was the number that he gave?

45:40.024 --> 45:43.247
900,000 books of me have been pulped or whatever.

45:43.847 --> 45:45.129
Where did he get that from?

45:46.009 --> 45:47.070
Quite a bit.

45:47.110 --> 45:50.974
Not a lot of books, a period of time, to be discarded.

45:51.014 --> 45:55.418
I mean, especially books that have been used and are falling apart.

45:55.651 --> 46:00.477
mean that these books weren't replaced by other copies, or new copies, or that they weren't duplicates.

46:00.897 --> 46:01.258
I don't know.

46:01.398 --> 46:03.881
Well, that's what I mean about it being a simplistic argument.

46:04.081 --> 46:05.082
Yeah.

46:05.102 --> 46:14.173
Well, it resonated with some people, and, but I'm not going to, I really have to walk a fine line, because I don't want to be Nick Baker's Boswell either, you know.

46:14.193 --> 46:15.415
I mean, he writes his own books.

46:15.955 --> 46:18.779
This fellow is, I'm really kind of pleased he's doing that.

46:18.799 --> 46:19.580
Yeah, because you don't have to.

46:19.600 --> 46:20.641
Well, I can quote him, though.

46:20.701 --> 46:25.607
I don't have to, I don't have to, I can quote him myself, I can quote people like,

46:26.026 --> 46:31.573
him and you, you know, and I'm the reporter here.

46:31.593 --> 46:41.144
There's a wonderful paragraph here in the introduction, all of the reasons, all of Baker's arguments.

46:44.969 --> 46:47.632
Do you want me to leave that with you and you could mail it to me in a week or so?

46:47.652 --> 46:48.453
No, that's fine.

46:49.134 --> 46:50.095
Partly because I'm leaving tomorrow.

46:50.115 --> 46:52.658
You're leaving tomorrow and you're going to the Caribbean, that's right.

46:53.532 --> 46:55.414
I'm glad to know about it.

46:55.494 --> 47:00.340
Yeah, and it'll be out in August, so if you're interested in it.

47:00.361 --> 47:04.706
I thought you'd kind of like to see the, uh... Jeanette Bastion.

47:04.726 --> 47:06.628
I've never heard of him.

47:06.648 --> 47:07.449
He writes well, too.

47:07.469 --> 47:13.417
And he's got a website, Richard Cox.

47:13.437 --> 47:18.563
And he just goes to search in Pittsburgh, you know Richard Pittsburgh.

47:18.583 --> 47:19.825
And who's the publisher, I assume?

47:19.885 --> 47:20.425
Greenwood.

47:20.506 --> 47:21.607
Oh, that's right.

47:21.727 --> 47:23.269
They do a lot of library-type things.

47:23.772 --> 47:24.032
Yeah.

47:30.039 --> 47:36.506
Serious news is generally made through a hook, preferably one with a famous name, before jumping on important societal issues.

47:37.687 --> 47:37.908
Yeah.

47:37.928 --> 47:39.509
Yeah.

47:39.529 --> 47:46.297
Baker, a non-librarian and non-archivist, displaying a remarkable lack of understanding about what these institutions and their professionals do.

47:46.978 --> 47:50.321
Well, you see, Baker's an academic, right?

47:50.642 --> 47:50.842
No.

47:51.022 --> 47:51.442
Isn't he?

47:51.803 --> 47:53.625
Isn't he a faculty member somewhere?

47:53.685 --> 47:53.745
No.

47:53.827 --> 47:55.709
Well, he's behaving like a faculty member.

47:55.729 --> 47:57.270
People mistake him for a faculty member.

47:57.290 --> 48:01.013
He's lived in Berkeley because his father-in-law taught in the Classics department.

48:01.033 --> 48:02.355
But he didn't teach Berkeley.

48:02.835 --> 48:03.315
Oh, okay.

48:03.335 --> 48:04.096
Now he's up in Maine.

48:04.156 --> 48:05.217
He moved back to Maine.

48:05.277 --> 48:06.418
I don't think he's ever taught.

48:06.778 --> 48:11.242
He worked in Boston for some computer company before he was Nick Nicholson Baker, you know.

48:11.262 --> 48:13.725
But, no, he's not an academic.

48:13.965 --> 48:16.827
He looks like one, I have to say.

48:17.128 --> 48:18.829
He's a very nice guy, by the way.

48:18.889 --> 48:22.112
I mean, if you get beyond the...

48:23.847 --> 48:26.150
But he's not an academic.

48:26.170 --> 48:28.973
It is funny, because he does come across like one very much, though.

48:28.993 --> 48:29.894
Yeah, he does, but he's not.

48:30.535 --> 48:31.356
Yeah.

48:31.376 --> 48:45.233
It's funny, because as I was getting ready to leave Georgetown last year, my advisory, my external advisory council, during their meeting, gave a dinner for me, and then gave me some gifts.

48:45.253 --> 48:51.481
You know, certificate of appreciation, and this and that.

48:51.521 --> 48:53.263
And one of them came up to me and handed me

48:53.665 --> 48:58.810
something, a wrapped, something rather felt, it was a book.

48:59.591 --> 49:00.012
I opened it.

49:00.552 --> 49:10.763
It was double-fold, and I opened it up, and the guy had gone, had met Nicholson Baker somewhere, and had gotten him to autograph the book to me.

49:12.665 --> 49:13.286
I screamed.

49:13.326 --> 49:15.968
That's funny.

49:16.249 --> 49:17.690
Yeah, it was very funny.

49:18.771 --> 49:19.352
But, um,

49:22.268 --> 49:24.852
I guess that's my bottom line, you know, it's too simplistic.

49:25.172 --> 49:31.381
Why do you think that we haven't really heard from the community of librarians in response, have we?

49:31.421 --> 49:32.082
Has that?

49:32.662 --> 49:37.689
And maybe they just haven't been given voice in the media at all.

49:37.709 --> 49:39.011
I suspect that that's the case.

49:40.393 --> 49:42.516
It's probably a combination of things.

49:42.877 --> 49:45.220
There have been some organizational responses.

49:45.240 --> 49:46.862
I know ARL put something together.

49:47.683 --> 49:49.326
I'm not sure what ALA did.

49:49.846 --> 49:51.769
I was certainly paying attention to ARL.

49:52.171 --> 49:54.473
And that's there.

49:55.274 --> 50:03.721
One of the things is probably, if you respond to something like this, people are even more likely to believe it.

50:04.322 --> 50:10.187
Or if you react too much, then people are going to think you have something to hide.

50:10.207 --> 50:14.190
Or if you don't pay attention to him, maybe he'll go away.

50:16.452 --> 50:17.793
Now, is Nichols still at Hopkins?

50:18.894 --> 50:19.134
Yes.

50:19.915 --> 50:22.077
Is that going to make a telephone conversation with him?

50:22.293 --> 50:24.435
I quoted him in the patient report.

50:26.738 --> 50:48.503
Winston Tabb, I might have spoken with him two years ago, and he mentioned this at the Simmons Conference last year, but he said, Elsie is exploring, that's kind of almost so quixotic, but there is this Norwegian approach, strategy, where they borrowed an underground cave up in the Arctic Circle,

50:48.787 --> 50:50.128
The Deep Please Approach.

50:50.209 --> 50:51.049
Have you heard about that?

50:51.470 --> 50:52.751
It sounds vaguely familiar, yeah.

50:52.871 --> 50:53.933
And he wants to do that.

50:53.953 --> 50:54.874
Well, I call these people.

50:54.914 --> 50:57.637
I talk to them, you know, and that'll be in this new book, too.

50:58.057 --> 50:59.959
The Deep Please Approach.

50:59.999 --> 51:00.460
In Norway?

51:00.920 --> 51:01.681
Yeah, Norway.

51:02.842 --> 51:03.443
I talk to them.

51:03.483 --> 51:07.587
I didn't go there, but I did a telephone, and they've got a website so you can see what it looks like.

51:09.129 --> 51:13.474
But Winston, how could you possibly do something like that with the United States, though?

51:14.415 --> 51:15.456
Yeah, this is a little Norway.

51:15.536 --> 51:17.258
I mean, we're talking...

51:17.795 --> 51:21.819
60,000 new books a year that we publish in this country.

51:21.839 --> 51:22.639
I mean, L.C.

51:22.679 --> 51:24.561
gets thousands of things a day.

51:25.002 --> 51:32.548
How could you possibly take one and send it up to a cave up in Alaska or something like that?

51:32.689 --> 51:43.018
The facility that is most like that that I can think of in the United States is the one outside of Salt Lake City, where the Mormon Church has its archives.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.401
It's right in a mountain.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.102
It's rather spectacular.

51:49.803 --> 51:50.304
Is that right?

51:50.404 --> 51:51.806
There's some Mormon church that does this?

51:51.826 --> 51:52.046
Yeah.

51:53.529 --> 51:55.371
I'm going to be out there in September.

51:55.792 --> 51:58.536
I'm going to have a great Salt Lake book conference and invite me out.

51:58.556 --> 52:00.519
Maybe I'll take a look at it while I'm there.

52:01.280 --> 52:01.400
Great.

52:01.420 --> 52:01.641
Yeah.

52:01.741 --> 52:08.051
Also, the University of Minnesota borrowed, under the banks of the Mississippi, they did their deep, their off-site story.

52:08.111 --> 52:08.651
Oh, that's right.

52:08.712 --> 52:09.352
Yes.

52:09.373 --> 52:09.573
Yeah.

52:09.593 --> 52:11.456
Which is really not off-site because it's the camp.

52:11.496 --> 52:12.377
Now, that's perfect.

52:12.718 --> 52:15.462
You know, I see limestone and sandstone caves.

52:15.482 --> 52:15.662
Yeah.

52:16.064 --> 52:18.968
I mean, you can actually get a book within an hour from off-site storage.

52:19.309 --> 52:21.031
I don't know of any place that could do that.

52:21.071 --> 52:22.493
Harvard can do it in a day.

52:22.914 --> 52:23.154
Yeah.

52:23.294 --> 52:25.818
But they say they can do it within an hour.

52:26.499 --> 52:26.879
That's nice.

52:27.199 --> 52:27.740
But it's right there.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.284
Here's the campus, and here are the caves.

52:31.305 --> 52:33.949
And they've got two of them, plenty of room to do others.

52:34.029 --> 52:34.970
But that's a blessing.

52:35.090 --> 52:36.593
It's a location.

52:36.613 --> 52:43.282
And in Minnesota, they're used to digging tunnels to protect themselves from the cold weather.

52:43.602 --> 52:44.303
Yeah, exactly.

52:45.164 --> 52:45.565
Perfect.

52:45.815 --> 52:47.757
It's Salt Lake, and of course it's in S. Salt.

52:48.978 --> 52:49.519
I checked that out.

52:49.539 --> 52:52.001
That's the Mormon Church that does that?

52:52.021 --> 52:52.322
Yeah.

52:52.342 --> 52:55.085
It doesn't have a name in the library or anything like that.

52:57.107 --> 53:05.976
It's the vault for the genealogical, you know, all the microfilm and the archival stuff.

53:06.617 --> 53:12.683
Because, you know, part of their faith is that you seek out your ancestors and

53:13.169 --> 53:16.312
save them that way, and so all of these records are very important.

53:17.354 --> 53:18.915
I'll check it out.

53:18.935 --> 53:26.483
Listen, I want to let you... I'd like to go back and absorb this and maybe follow up with a future... Sure.

53:26.984 --> 53:29.667
I don't feel that I've given you very much information.

53:29.687 --> 53:31.068
I've certainly given you my feelings.

53:31.188 --> 53:31.889
Yeah, well, that's good.

53:31.909 --> 53:32.650
The feelings are good.

53:32.890 --> 53:38.376
Maybe you can tell me a little bit more about how exactly you're doing the preservation thing.

53:38.656 --> 53:40.138
Yeah, well, why don't I...

53:40.203 --> 53:43.455
digital libraries and that kind of stuff.

53:45.262 --> 53:47.952
I've written most of this, a lot of this.
