WEBVTT

00:03.305 --> 00:04.126
Okay, we'll run again.

00:07.150 --> 00:07.250
Okay.

00:07.270 --> 00:12.556
One thing, I love reading about other collectors and about the whole world.

00:12.897 --> 00:17.722
I've always been curious as to whether, I mean, is there in fact a market for these books?

00:17.742 --> 00:18.864
I mean... My book?

00:19.004 --> 00:19.344
Yeah.

00:20.406 --> 00:21.487
I sold Random House.

00:24.551 --> 00:26.273
I'll shut this up.

00:26.453 --> 00:28.455
Yeah, I'm very interested.

00:28.495 --> 00:28.956
Fascinating.

00:28.976 --> 00:29.076
Okay.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.418
Can't wait for the book.

00:30.438 --> 00:30.738
Am I on?

00:30.858 --> 00:32.240
Yeah, I'm on.

00:32.981 --> 00:33.261
All right.

00:33.595 --> 00:35.097
I think I've covered most things.

00:35.137 --> 00:36.559
Is there anything you feel I should know?

00:36.620 --> 00:40.225
Not that I can think of.

00:40.325 --> 00:41.727
I may think of some things afterwards.

00:42.268 --> 00:42.689
Okay.

00:42.929 --> 00:47.215
At some point, when you're set up, could I come soon?

00:47.236 --> 00:47.536
Absolutely.

00:49.158 --> 00:57.571
We had to gut this apartment, and we're supposedly going to get in in April, and it'll probably take me a couple of months to get the books in.

00:57.671 --> 00:59.093
But I, of course, would love you to see it.

00:59.113 --> 01:02.218
I don't know whether that's going to be too late for you.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.014
I'm sorry, April?

01:03.314 --> 01:03.615
April.

01:05.958 --> 01:06.639
Well, we'll see.

01:06.839 --> 01:08.322
Yeah, okay.

01:08.342 --> 01:09.423
How far along are you?

01:10.064 --> 01:14.070
I'm supposed to have a copy in by March of 91, but I'm going to need more time.

01:14.090 --> 01:14.991
And they said I can have it.

01:15.111 --> 01:15.972
They're very excited.

01:16.213 --> 01:16.753
Are they excited?

01:16.774 --> 01:17.294
That's great.

01:17.314 --> 01:18.376
Well, you talk about it so well.

01:18.396 --> 01:19.337
I've got a paperback deal.

01:20.258 --> 01:21.020
Great.

01:21.721 --> 01:22.041
Great.

01:22.141 --> 01:23.002
Terrific.

01:23.523 --> 01:24.945
Terrific.

01:24.965 --> 01:25.566
I can't wait.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.808
You grew up in Beverly Hills.

01:27.649 --> 01:29.311
I'm going to have a chapter in California.

01:29.432 --> 01:29.792
Really?

01:30.380 --> 01:32.121
because it's different collecting out there.

01:34.163 --> 01:39.608
It had been alleged, and I use that verb, that the action had moved to California.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.309
I don't think that's the case.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.433
Yeah, I mean, were there Huntington and Doheny and... I don't even mean that.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.033
I mean, today.

01:46.113 --> 01:48.615
I mean, with Hollywood money, Beverly Hills.

01:48.755 --> 01:50.016
Have you ever been to Heritage?

01:50.817 --> 01:51.318
Yes.

01:51.338 --> 01:51.978
Oh, sure.

01:51.998 --> 01:52.979
Absolutely.

01:52.999 --> 01:55.281
And Lou tells me, I had a guy come in today.

01:57.563 --> 01:59.304
We have to designate him I.I.

01:59.384 --> 02:00.285
You know, we can't name him.

02:00.923 --> 02:07.332
And he's been married for 21 years, and he gave me 21 authors, and I have to go out and fill, meaning Lou.

02:07.853 --> 02:09.435
And when it's ready, give it to him.

02:09.455 --> 02:10.437
Price is no object.

02:11.418 --> 02:13.682
And I said, Lou, is that collecting?

02:13.702 --> 02:14.543
That's not collecting.

02:14.763 --> 02:15.664
I said, the joy.

02:16.045 --> 02:16.906
That's like buying.

02:16.966 --> 02:17.848
That's like buying.

02:17.868 --> 02:20.131
I said, I want red books, and I want blue books.

02:20.151 --> 02:23.556
What I said to him, I said, don't you feel like an interior decorator?

02:24.918 --> 02:28.483
And he said, do you know how much money interior decorators make in Beverly Hills?

02:28.801 --> 02:29.883
That's probably true.

02:29.964 --> 02:31.727
Well, but I mean, it's not book collecting.

02:31.747 --> 02:33.030
No, it's not book collecting, exactly.

02:33.050 --> 02:38.603
So, I intend to make... Well, I don't think he knew how devastating that was.

02:39.705 --> 02:41.930
Well, I mean, it's becoming like art out there.

02:41.950 --> 02:44.295
I mean, people say, I've got to have a... You've got to have...

02:44.579 --> 02:45.480
Calder or something.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.782
I don't care what it looks like.

02:46.802 --> 02:54.715
It goes back to what you were saying earlier, also, that paintings are much too expensive to buy, and it's kind of something else.

02:54.795 --> 03:04.570
But there's still, I mean, people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a second-rate picture by second-rate artists.

03:04.730 --> 03:11.300
It's what I guess books were in the 20s, and books certainly are not, they just don't have that kind of glamour.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.303
I mean, the explosion in

03:14.009 --> 03:16.031
fine arts and, you know, values and so forth.

03:16.612 --> 03:19.315
It seems to me that books, in a way, have not participated in that.

03:19.336 --> 03:27.185
I mean, prices have gone up, but... Is there a vision at work in your collection?

03:27.205 --> 03:27.566
I don't know.

03:27.606 --> 03:28.907
That's too big a word for me.

03:28.927 --> 03:29.708
Okay.

03:29.728 --> 03:30.429
Good.

03:30.569 --> 03:31.871
That's fine.

03:32.512 --> 03:36.877
You don't see yourself going the way of Arthur Holton and losing interest in something like that?

03:36.897 --> 03:37.217
No.

03:37.237 --> 03:37.358
No.

03:37.378 --> 03:39.140
No, no, no.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.361
I'm going to be more selective.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.425
I'm going to be a lot more selective.

03:44.249 --> 03:47.392
for physical and financial reasons.

03:47.412 --> 03:53.198
And I'm going to, you know, my want list is going to be much smaller in the future.

03:53.218 --> 03:55.180
But there's no way I'm going to stop.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.484
That's a wonderful quote.

03:58.524 --> 04:02.408
I can see that in type.

04:03.228 --> 04:05.691
And I guess that kind of anticipates the next question.

04:05.731 --> 04:06.412
Where does it end?

04:06.472 --> 04:07.213
Does it ever end?

04:07.273 --> 04:11.097
I think it's such an ornament in one's life.

04:11.137 --> 04:12.518
I mean, I think it's such a pleasure.

04:13.173 --> 04:15.498
You don't want sex to end.

04:15.558 --> 04:18.364
You don't want to stop eating good food.

04:18.424 --> 04:25.078
I mean, it may be a madness, but it's also very gratifying and a lot of fun.

04:26.040 --> 04:26.701
Okay.

04:26.721 --> 04:32.734
And the quote from the house and garden, as far as I'm concerned, you can't be too rich, too thin, have too many books.

04:33.035 --> 04:35.519
quote still on the record, or do you want to amend that?

04:35.719 --> 04:37.382
Well, it's a, you know, that's been used.

04:37.402 --> 04:41.028
I mean, not the eye out of the thing about the books, but the other one is such a cliche.

04:41.068 --> 04:42.570
There's nothing very original in that.

04:42.751 --> 04:44.994
But there's too many books, though.

04:45.014 --> 04:48.720
But I think in light of what you just said, you are going to be a little bit more selective.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.368
I have to, but this became unmanageable.

04:53.388 --> 04:55.291
Let me just take a quick look.

04:55.311 --> 04:56.773
And it's not a high spot collection.

04:56.793 --> 04:58.476
No, by any matter of means.

04:58.516 --> 04:59.818
That's very, very important.

05:00.322 --> 05:09.576
I think it's the kind of collection that would ultimately be of real value to scholars and students and so forth.

05:09.656 --> 05:11.178
Which suggests another question.

05:12.680 --> 05:17.026
Let's say I'm doing a thesis on Tennessee Williams.

05:17.046 --> 05:17.928
Could I see your stuff?

05:18.308 --> 05:18.789
Absolutely.

05:19.510 --> 05:21.573
You don't close your stuff to scholars?

05:21.593 --> 05:21.713
No.

05:21.773 --> 05:22.134
That's right.

05:22.154 --> 05:24.237
I think you ought to make that point, by the way.

05:24.537 --> 05:27.201
Because the collector does have a responsibility, don't you think?

05:27.361 --> 05:27.962
Right.

05:28.122 --> 05:28.503
I agree.

05:28.523 --> 05:29.224
Let's put a question on that.

05:29.244 --> 05:29.584
I agree totally.

05:29.624 --> 05:30.345
I've cooperated.

05:30.365 --> 05:33.349
Do you think the collector has a responsibility to the role of scholars?

05:33.409 --> 05:33.990
Absolutely.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.693
And I think you've got to make it available.

05:36.033 --> 05:36.434
Absolutely.

05:36.454 --> 05:37.355
And you do make it available.

05:37.375 --> 05:41.541
I do, absolutely, with Williams' pension material I've made available.

05:41.581 --> 05:45.106
So what they do is they submit a request?

05:45.126 --> 05:45.707
Yeah, yeah.

05:45.807 --> 05:46.428
You consider it?

05:46.548 --> 05:47.609
Yeah, yeah.

05:47.770 --> 05:48.651
That's good to know.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.674
I mean, Folger would never let anybody see anything.

05:50.694 --> 05:51.675
Yeah, I know, I know.

05:51.790 --> 05:57.338
And I've lent stuff to Columbia on several occasions for exhibitions.

05:57.679 --> 06:00.823
You did anticipate the collecting of screenplays, I guess.

06:01.044 --> 06:02.085
Yeah, I think so.

06:02.326 --> 06:05.490
That's probably my Hollywood background, as a matter of fact, I think.

06:07.794 --> 06:09.136
That's an interesting area, I think.

06:11.139 --> 06:14.243
I guess LD is into that now, too.

06:14.804 --> 06:16.267
Well, it's just another area.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.633
Fleming had, I forget who they belonged to originally.

06:20.866 --> 06:26.314
apparently a big box of Faulkner material, including all the Faulkner screenplays.

06:27.375 --> 06:32.543
And apparently never even opened the box.

06:32.563 --> 06:36.428
And he once said to me that he had material in what I'd be interested in or anything in any of it.

06:36.448 --> 06:37.850
And I said, God, yes.

06:38.491 --> 06:41.455
And I bought about three screenplays.

06:41.475 --> 06:46.322
I mean, The Big Sleep, The Have and Have Not, and I think one other.

06:47.063 --> 06:47.204
Jeez.

06:47.965 --> 06:50.248
And then LD bought the rest of it.

06:50.431 --> 06:53.975
But, I mean, Fleming had no conception of what he had there.

06:53.995 --> 06:55.717
Did he just offer it as a lot?

06:56.057 --> 06:56.918
He offered it as a lot.

06:57.299 --> 06:59.321
And did he put an arbitrary price on it?

07:01.403 --> 07:04.006
I think the price for the lot was too much for him.

07:04.026 --> 07:05.588
It was like $100,000 for the lot.

07:06.769 --> 07:08.251
He had some idea of what he had.

07:08.271 --> 07:08.911
Well, yeah.

07:09.272 --> 07:11.414
I think he paid a lot for it, though, as a matter of fact.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.738
But, I mean, I don't know.

07:14.818 --> 07:16.340
Cheap at the price, frankly.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.582
That's a unique material.

07:19.658 --> 07:29.731
I think that when you have Faulkner adapting Chandler or Faulkner adapting Hemingway, I mean, talk about connections, that's a great connection.

07:29.751 --> 07:31.253
Is it typescript or is it...?

07:31.273 --> 07:33.897
The good ones are typescripts, yeah.

07:34.338 --> 07:42.128
Technically, Peter Howard's pretty good, and I'll tell you, Peter Stern is good on this.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.953
There are screenplays and there are screenplays.

07:46.169 --> 07:55.186
There could be 2,000 of them like the apathetic proof at some point, and more and more that's happening because people realize they have value.

07:59.734 --> 08:06.707
I guess Henry Miller, Tropical Cancer, is the first thing you've got.

08:06.727 --> 08:08.751
That's pretty much all on the record.

08:09.828 --> 08:11.831
I guess I think I've covered most of the stuff.

08:11.851 --> 08:13.773
I'd like to get in touch again if that's okay.

08:13.893 --> 08:14.514
Absolutely.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.255
One other question.

08:15.295 --> 08:19.801
I guess one thing you did say when you started, that there really was no competition to Mount.

08:20.382 --> 08:21.243
There wasn't a lot.

08:21.263 --> 08:23.246
I mean, for what I was doing, major competition.

08:23.266 --> 08:25.709
I mean, you mentioned Jane Engelhard, but not really.

08:25.929 --> 08:26.750
Not really, no.

08:27.411 --> 08:27.772
Not really.

08:27.812 --> 08:31.276
She had some American things, but it wasn't really a literary collection.

08:31.296 --> 08:32.658
So that's very important.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.223
I guess that weighed very heavily in your consideration, the fact that it wasn't

08:36.473 --> 08:38.496
Lennox going against John Carter Brown.

08:38.736 --> 08:40.659
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

08:40.679 --> 08:51.353
And then if you were able to bring taste, which you had, a modicum of means, which you had, and... It was a big asset, there's no question about it.

08:51.473 --> 09:02.869
I find in more recent time, I mean, in the Martin Sale, there was a Henry James piece that I didn't have.

09:04.908 --> 09:07.091
But it's just, I mean, it's, you know, the little, whatever it is.

09:07.432 --> 09:11.598
The Europeans, is it?

09:11.659 --> 09:15.264
I mean, it's the little pamphlet.

09:15.284 --> 09:16.186
Sold for big bucks, I think.

09:16.206 --> 09:16.366
What?

09:16.606 --> 09:17.768
I think I know the one you're talking about.

09:17.788 --> 09:19.931
Sold for big bucks, I think.

09:19.952 --> 09:25.741
The last time I ever saw it, you know, for said lesson, was like $600, something like that.

09:25.761 --> 09:28.305
And I said, well, this is one of the few things I haven't got.

09:28.465 --> 09:32.451
And I told the, Glenn Horowitz, I guess, was bidding for me, let's go to

09:32.701 --> 09:34.043
$3,000, more up to $17,000.

09:34.223 --> 09:40.573
I mean, whatever it is, 50 times higher than the last one.

09:40.753 --> 09:41.635
Tarzan went for $28,000.

09:41.935 --> 09:45.581
A kid from Texas, 22 years old.

09:46.322 --> 09:48.265
I talked to him.

09:49.026 --> 09:51.350
Okay, I shut off.

09:51.370 --> 09:52.712
Is that right with you?

09:52.732 --> 09:52.992
Absolutely.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.117
Do you believe this is a new golden age?

09:57.299 --> 09:57.699
Does this run?

09:57.819 --> 09:58.400
Yeah, that's right.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.784
It goes so slow, I can't tell sometimes.

10:01.169 --> 10:17.633
David Redden at South Beach once said he thought this was a new golden age in book collecting, because the institutions, number one, don't have the money, number two, the tax laws have changed, and so collectors really aren't encouraged to give things, and also the value.

10:17.653 --> 10:19.175
I mean, do you agree with that?

10:20.517 --> 10:27.447
Well, I'm still amazed by the lack of

10:27.730 --> 10:33.457
people with the resources and paste who wouldn't occur to them to collect books.

10:33.477 --> 10:37.001
I mean, it has not become fashionable yet.

10:37.321 --> 10:43.749
You have Sotheby's and Christie's promoting the hell out of it, then it probably will become more fashionable.

10:43.869 --> 10:45.231
But I prefer it the way it is.

10:45.311 --> 10:54.822
I mean, I keep the prices down, and, you know, when you start selling Jasper Johns prints for $150,000, it becomes really absurd.

10:55.183 --> 10:56.404
Ed Wolfe said,

10:57.734 --> 11:02.759
He said, look, we don't have every poor Richard's almanac here at the library company in Philadelphia.

11:02.799 --> 11:03.960
I don't know if there's a set ever.

11:04.080 --> 11:04.681
He said, no.

11:05.321 --> 11:08.885
Yeah, but he's saying golden age means also the stuff is available.

11:08.925 --> 11:13.009
He said, do you think that Hunt there, anybody can go out and buy 22 Shakespeare quartos?

11:13.029 --> 11:13.729
Right.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.232
It's not available.

11:16.272 --> 11:26.762
One of the reasons I started where I started was that I really felt I could not put together a major Melville or Whitman collection or Twain collection and most of the good material.

11:27.181 --> 11:28.023
You know, it was gone.

11:28.665 --> 11:33.296
But by starting later, that material was still available.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.740
You see, I'm glad I hung around.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.144
That's a very important quote.

11:36.164 --> 11:36.585
Yeah.

11:36.605 --> 11:38.049
It relates to what Texas did.

11:38.069 --> 11:39.131
Right, exactly.

11:39.292 --> 11:40.334
In fact, the 20th century.

11:40.374 --> 11:41.036
Yeah, exactly.

11:41.116 --> 11:44.485
Well, it took the next text.

11:44.505 --> 11:44.565
OK.
