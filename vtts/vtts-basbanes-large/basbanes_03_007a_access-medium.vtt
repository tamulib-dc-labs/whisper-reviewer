00:03.389 --> 00:07.355
We're talking with Dr. Klass, and she just asked me a wonderful question.

00:07.635 --> 00:08.477
Why don't you just repeat it?

00:08.817 --> 00:28.346
Oh, I was asking whether, we were talking about books that changed the world, and I was asking how many of them were fiction, and I was wondering whether there are any of the sort of industrial revolution novels of England, many of which were written in a spirit of protest, which actually changed the world, turned up in legislative debates, anything?

00:28.386 --> 00:30.409
Well, what do you think?

00:31.520 --> 00:34.883
I mean, Rachel Carson I would certainly put in there.

00:36.025 --> 00:53.883
I would even put To Kill a Mockingbird in there, and if not changing the world, it's certainly changing the way people think about civil rights, and even its life as a movie, which transcends its impact as a literary work.

00:53.943 --> 00:56.245
Industrial Revolution is a great question.

00:56.545 --> 01:08.805
Well, I actually cite To Kill a Mockingbird every time I talk about Reach Out and Read, because I talk about how our ideas of how children learn to read have changed.

01:09.506 --> 01:23.869
And one of the things which I read in a history of ideas about how children learn to read was that in the 1920s, there was an idea that the developing brain wasn't ready for the work of reading until children were six years and six months old.

01:24.203 --> 01:38.657
And that seems very far away, but if you read To Kill a Mockingbird, she goes to the first day of school in first grade, and the teacher discovers that she can read and is very upset by it and tells her to go home and tell her father not to read with her anymore.

01:39.738 --> 01:41.460
Boy, that's amazing, isn't it?

01:41.520 --> 01:41.780
Yeah.

01:41.820 --> 01:46.325
That's almost a negative approach to the situation.

01:46.385 --> 01:47.626
Yeah, yeah.

01:47.706 --> 01:52.391
The teacher says something like, you know, your daddy does not know how to teach reading.

01:52.471 --> 01:52.911
I'm going to...

01:53.195 --> 01:55.538
try to undo all the damage that he's done.

01:56.239 --> 02:00.564
And was this a prevailing thought?

02:00.644 --> 02:06.510
That's what the articles that I had read about the history of attitudes about how to teach reading had said.

02:07.011 --> 02:10.215
But you never know whether that's real or whether it's kind of a straw man.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.819
You know, we're sort of laughing at the funny ideas they had in the 1920s.

02:13.919 --> 02:17.363
Wasn't it a thought for many years?

02:17.866 --> 02:20.350
medical people, that reading was bad for women?

02:20.790 --> 02:27.300
Yeah, well, certainly that reading fiction, maybe not reading, you know, improving devotional.

02:28.001 --> 02:43.384
But, yeah, you come frequently, in the nineteenth century, you come across the idea that, you know, reading frivolous novels is bad for people, or saps their energy, or saps the strength that they should use for something else.

02:43.651 --> 02:47.055
I find it fascinating that you have ... Here we are, Somerville.

02:47.476 --> 02:52.722
You could, as a professional, as a physician, you could probably be anywhere you wanted to be.

02:53.864 --> 02:58.590
Here you are in an industrial area that's hard to find.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.031
It's right off an interstate.

03:00.432 --> 03:01.253
You're upstairs.

03:02.054 --> 03:03.075
There's an iron foundry downstairs.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.478
There's an iron foundry, I learned, downstairs.

03:06.259 --> 03:13.388
I guess, what is it that brings you here as an entry into the conversation?

03:13.604 --> 03:20.092
Reach Out and Read grew up in... Do I need to go sort of check myself out in the bathroom mirror?

03:20.292 --> 03:22.655
Am I groomed?

03:22.675 --> 03:23.376
You look wonderful.

03:23.396 --> 03:23.597
All right.

03:23.857 --> 03:25.499
You tell me if I'm in trouble.

03:26.180 --> 03:33.329
Reach Out and Read grew up in Boston Medical Center, actually in the hospital, in the Department of Pediatrics.

03:33.409 --> 03:35.291
I'd be able to look at these before I go.

03:35.852 --> 03:42.160
And we outgrew it at a certain point, as we went from being one program to being multiple programs as we...

03:42.578 --> 03:48.885
hired staff and actually started becoming a small nonprofit organization.

03:48.905 --> 03:52.229
And we needed more space.

03:52.389 --> 04:01.218
And we went looking for space that would really work for us, where we could accommodate what seemed to us a very large staff.

04:02.219 --> 04:04.882
And this building was available.

04:04.922 --> 04:07.025
We could have much more space for the same money.

04:07.105 --> 04:09.768
It's worked out well for us.

04:09.788 --> 04:11.910
We may soon grow it.

04:12.363 --> 04:15.367
But, you know, we are a nonprofit.

04:15.507 --> 04:16.828
We raise money.

04:18.110 --> 04:25.379
I mean, there's something wrong about a nonprofit that spends its money on very lavish offices.

04:25.399 --> 04:36.652
This is comfortable and actually very convenient for all the people who commute, much more convenient than a wonderful address in downtown Boston would be, because they'd have to all drive into the city.

04:36.672 --> 04:38.995
People just come through on the expressway.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.983
I don't think I was talking so much geographically, I guess.

04:46.226 --> 04:50.030
Philosophically, what brings you here as a professional?

04:50.050 --> 04:59.559
Well, my involvement with Reach Out and Read really started as an accident, and maybe many such things do.

04:59.659 --> 05:04.684
Maybe many obsessions or fanaticisms do.

05:05.225 --> 05:07.767
This program was founded 15 years ago.

05:08.101 --> 05:17.932
by two other pediatricians, Barry Zuckerman and Robert Needleman, and an early childhood educator at what was then Boston City Hospital and is now Boston Medical Center.

05:18.873 --> 05:29.745
And when one of the pediatricians who'd founded it, Robert Needleman, got a job and moved to Cleveland about ten years ago, and I had interviewed him.

05:29.785 --> 05:36.673
I had written an article for the New York Times Magazine about the Department of Pediatrics and about the

05:37.244 --> 05:53.367
about the practical issues of trying to practice and teach pediatrics and do research in pediatrics in a setting that was essentially serving very poor children, and what kinds of programs and what kinds of research and what kinds of medicine and what kinds of medical issues.

05:54.028 --> 06:00.197
And I had interviewed Robert about the Reach Out and Read program, and I had liked it, and when he told me he was moving to Cleveland,

06:00.599 --> 06:02.722
He'd given me what I thought were very good quotes.

06:02.742 --> 06:04.304
He told me he was moving to Cleveland.

06:04.324 --> 06:07.547
I said, oh, what's going to happen to that nice little book program you run?

06:08.068 --> 06:14.256
And he said, I'm looking for someone who can take it over, because I'm afraid otherwise it'll just wither away.

06:14.916 --> 06:21.324
And I believe his actual words were, they won't pay you anything, but it'll only take an hour or so a week.

06:21.344 --> 06:27.512
So I was doing pediatric infectious diseases, which is what my fellowship training is.

06:27.592 --> 06:28.513
And I said, sure.

06:29.202 --> 06:57.268
And soon after that, the other founding pediatrician, who's Barry Zuckerman, who's now the chairman of the department and the chairman of our board, had this vision that we should replicate the program, that we should write a grant, that we should write a manual, that we should help other programs do this, and that, in fact, this idea of promoting reading aloud and giving out books at pediatric visits was something with enormous potential that it could become

06:57.586 --> 06:59.910
he likes to say, as standard as giving shots.

07:00.711 --> 07:07.884
And I'm not even sure that he had a sense of how it would catch on and how it would grow.

07:08.024 --> 07:15.317
But as it grew, it kind of took over bigger and bigger chunks of my life, squeezed out other things.

07:16.879 --> 07:20.826
And I suspect that it has now

07:21.700 --> 07:23.763
I've probably become a fanatic.

07:23.963 --> 07:29.350
It's probably consuming your life to a degree, but pleasantly so.

07:29.450 --> 07:34.256
As I say, it's a gentle madness in another context.

07:34.696 --> 07:35.177
Exactly.

07:35.577 --> 07:43.387
You have to watch out that you don't become someone who's always looking for opportunities to hold forth on your subject and how it can save the world.

07:43.507 --> 07:48.754
If everybody else would just stop nattering on about all these other less relevant

07:49.173 --> 07:51.797
You've got the subject.

07:52.518 --> 07:55.923
See, you used the phrase, this little book program that he had.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.726
And is that basically how it started?

07:57.766 --> 07:59.489
I read this wonderful lecture that you gave.

07:59.509 --> 08:03.495
It published a PDF file.

08:03.515 --> 08:04.717
Colorado published it.

08:04.817 --> 08:16.294
It was a big 12-page lecture where you really get into the details of this Reach Out report, the three parts and the three elements that you try to use, and how you actually measure

08:16.527 --> 08:19.753
We can give you lots of research on the book.

08:19.773 --> 08:24.963
And really how a child will actually hold a book and turn it around.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.530
This dazzles me, and then making the transition from the picture to the word.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.674
Oh, I'll have to show you some of our materials.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.281
Yeah, well, what happened, the legend, I mean.

08:34.301 --> 08:39.210
Just let me finish, because I can frame that and then pick up as part of the question, but was any of this

08:39.663 --> 08:47.971
kind of in the part of the discourse when this program was starting, or really was it an attempt to put books in the hands of kids who might otherwise not have them?

08:47.991 --> 08:50.113
Well, I think some combination.

08:50.373 --> 09:04.787
That is to say, the legend of the founding of the program, and I wasn't there, and if the program was sufficiently successful that it already, even though it was only 15 years ago, has a little bit of legend to it, is that... And the legend is good, by the way.

09:04.807 --> 09:04.907
Yeah.

09:05.107 --> 09:07.189
Oh, absolutely.

09:08.131 --> 09:12.936
that you had this big waiting room for this big, busy inner-city clinic, and it was pretty barren.

09:13.457 --> 09:19.102
And the doctors and nurses used to bring in all kinds of used books from home, so there'd be something there.

09:19.743 --> 09:23.247
And that as fast as they brought in the used books, the kids took them home.

09:23.927 --> 09:28.833
And some people thought that this was... I can close the door.

09:28.853 --> 09:29.173
I'm sorry.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.474
Especially if you're taping it.

09:30.654 --> 09:31.455
Okay.

09:31.996 --> 09:37.141
It's probably better to close it, just so you won't end up with... They won't have to listen to me hold forth.

09:37.161 --> 09:37.902
They know all this.

09:38.219 --> 09:45.929
Some people thought this was a problem, that as quickly as you brought books in, they left.

09:46.389 --> 09:51.856
But most people thought that it was actually kind of nice to see the children leaving the clinic, holding on to the books.

09:51.956 --> 09:55.781
And they began to think about, should we do this systematically?

09:55.881 --> 10:00.907
What about if we actually bought books, and we bought new books, and we bought beautiful books?

10:01.288 --> 10:07.315
And then from that came the question, well, if you're going to actually spend money and get grants and beg for money to buy books,

10:08.425 --> 10:10.308
What kind of books would be most useful?

10:10.408 --> 10:12.011
What ages would you want to target?

10:12.091 --> 10:13.033
Who should give the book?

10:13.073 --> 10:18.562
What can you say when you give the book that will actually make it more likely that a parent will know what to do with the book?

10:19.042 --> 10:21.026
And that was the beginning of the program.

10:21.066 --> 10:28.337
But from the very beginning, there was a lot of thought about, you know, where should we concentrate our energies?

10:29.680 --> 10:30.701
We begin at six months.

10:30.721 --> 10:31.583
We end at five years.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.606
Neither of those is an accident.

10:33.957 --> 10:40.106
And in fact, both of those, there are people who disagree about, you know... Some think six months is too early, do you think?

10:40.206 --> 10:41.147
No, some think it's too late.

10:41.207 --> 10:46.134
There are a lot of programs out there that especially give a book at birth or a bag of books at birth.

10:46.154 --> 10:54.646
It's a very appealing idea, and a lot of states do it, or charitable groups that give you a book when you're born or a first book in the hospital.

10:55.427 --> 10:57.350
And we deliberately don't do that.

10:57.370 --> 11:01.095
We deliberately wait till six months because, well...

11:01.328 --> 11:07.957
Barry Zuckerman, my boss, feels strongly that up till six months, babies aren't really interested in objects.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.900
They're interested in voices and people.

11:09.920 --> 11:14.967
It's very important to talk to your baby and sing to your baby, but the book itself is not going to be that interesting.

11:15.027 --> 11:24.820
They can't focus that far away in terms of their eyes, and they're really much more, much less likely to reach and grasp and enjoy an object.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.884
And also, at six months, they can sit up by themselves.

11:27.964 --> 11:29.506
They've got social smiles.

11:29.566 --> 11:30.728
They're very interactive.

11:31.012 --> 11:33.295
So if you will, let me grab a book.

11:34.276 --> 11:34.957
I have all of our books.

11:38.020 --> 11:56.703
If you have a mother who maybe has never thought about reading to a child as an important activity, and you give her, this is one of our six-month-old books, because babies like faces.

11:57.404 --> 12:00.327
And so if you hold this book out to a six-month-old,

12:00.779 --> 12:02.241
The baby will smile.

12:02.301 --> 12:03.742
The baby will reach for the book.

12:03.762 --> 12:05.084
The baby will vocalize.

12:05.684 --> 12:15.435
The parent, even if the parent thinks this is like a strange or a silly idea to read to a child this young, the parent's going to see the reaction, and then, of course, the baby will grab the book and chew it.

12:16.256 --> 12:17.637
That's why we start with board books.

12:17.998 --> 12:25.926
So starting at six months is very deliberate, and then we do this at every checkup until five years, and then we stop at five years because...

12:26.277 --> 12:31.944
At that point, we hope the child's in school and there's at least somebody else in the child's life to talk about books and reading.

12:32.444 --> 12:43.417
And the idea was to target that window when maybe there, for many children, isn't anybody else pushing books and reading aloud.

12:43.457 --> 12:50.125
And I mean, one of the interesting things about talking to

12:50.797 --> 13:04.921
audiences, which include daycare providers and first-grade teachers and Head Start teachers and kindergarten teachers, is the unanimity with which those people say that on the first day of school you can look around the room and tell which children have never handled books.

13:05.482 --> 13:05.622
Really?

13:05.642 --> 13:13.395
And that there are always such children in the room, and they don't, at whatever age, three, four, five, they don't know how to hold a book, they don't know

13:13.645 --> 13:15.547
what it's for, why it's appealing.

13:15.567 --> 13:16.949
They don't know how to listen to a story.

13:16.969 --> 13:20.353
They don't understand kind of the narrative arc of the story.

13:20.373 --> 13:29.524
You probably have thought about all of this, but I had never thought about the question of how you know whether I'm talking to you or reading aloud to you.

13:30.165 --> 13:37.113
What is it about my voice which signals to you that I'm talking, not reading?

13:37.193 --> 13:42.319
Or when you're listening to a lecture, how do you know whether the lecturer is speaking from notes or

13:42.552 --> 13:49.803
reading a prepared talk, the children who are read to understand that difference very young.

13:50.524 --> 13:52.908
And you can tell they understand it because they babble.

13:52.948 --> 13:54.310
There's something called book babble.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.994
I saw that phrase, and I wrote it down.

13:57.014 --> 13:58.497
That's a new phrase for me.

13:58.617 --> 14:00.780
You know, babble, babble is this wordless

14:01.047 --> 14:04.370
It sounds an oxymoron, isn't it?

14:04.390 --> 14:06.212
No, book babble is really cool.

14:06.732 --> 14:07.993
It sounds like reading aloud.

14:08.013 --> 14:20.765
I can't really do it well, but it's a... Just as you can have a conversation in babble, a child whose, you know, children, babies go from just random syllables to babble that sounds like questions.

14:20.905 --> 14:31.054
And then, but they also, they develop a babble which sounds like reading aloud.

14:31.034 --> 14:38.625
And that's very early, and then by the time you get to school, right, you understand there's something about that cadence, that reading aloud cadence.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.068
Somebody must have analyzed what is the difference.

14:41.870 --> 14:44.714
I mean, I know I can hear the difference, but I don't know what I'm hearing.

14:44.754 --> 14:45.375
Fascinating.

14:45.895 --> 14:48.339
And it's a very productive step in the development of the child.

14:48.459 --> 14:50.081
Yeah, absolutely.

14:50.121 --> 14:58.273
Because the child is aspiring to read and is responding to... But it's also, the brain is somehow taking in, and there's a difference, you know...

14:58.507 --> 15:08.487
In addition to the actual work of decoding spoken language, what does this word mean, you have to learn as a child to decode all kinds of things.

15:08.647 --> 15:10.090
What's the emotional content?

15:10.130 --> 15:11.193
Is this information?

15:11.253 --> 15:12.415
Is this prohibition?

15:12.631 --> 15:13.972
What am I hearing?

15:14.012 --> 15:14.873
Why am I hearing this?

15:15.314 --> 15:20.619
And by the time you get to school, you want to know, oh, that's somebody reading a story.

15:20.679 --> 15:23.942
And you also want to think, oh, good, that's somebody reading a story.

15:24.122 --> 15:32.371
Now I'm going to pull up close so I can see the pictures, and I'm going to listen, and I want to know what happens next, and this is going to be fun.

15:32.891 --> 15:36.795
And children who are coming to school without being read to, this is all news.

15:37.676 --> 15:41.980
And I think it's a much harder job for teachers.

15:42.533 --> 15:48.560
Getting them from there to the work of learning to read is such a struggle.

15:49.100 --> 15:55.948
One of the things that I've come to understand working with this program is what an impressive thing it is that we learn to read.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.830
You know, what a hard job it is.

15:58.351 --> 16:12.507
You mentioned in one of the essays that you wrote, one of the lectures that you gave, probably in a room, that you really hope to have ten books in the possession of the child between the ages of six.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.949
That's how many visits there are.

16:15.989 --> 16:17.511
That's kind of a magic number.

16:17.551 --> 16:18.413
Do you want to grab that?

16:18.453 --> 16:21.376
No, no, no.

16:21.436 --> 16:24.040
So the selection becomes very significant, doesn't it?

16:24.060 --> 16:26.383
I mean, you must labor.

16:27.324 --> 16:27.604
We do.

16:27.885 --> 16:31.830
I'll introduce you to the people who put our catalog together.

16:31.890 --> 16:37.397
We put a catalog together with Scholastic Books that includes books from a large number of publishers.

16:37.732 --> 16:43.754
And it's a combination of the books that we think will work and we think are good and we can get good discounts on because money's always tight.

16:44.598 --> 16:48.231
And each program orders its own books because we have

16:48.565 --> 16:50.267
Our populations are very varied.

16:50.307 --> 16:53.131
I mean, this book that I was showing you, you'll notice it's bilingual.

16:53.452 --> 16:54.113
Russian English.

16:54.153 --> 16:54.974
Russian English.

16:55.855 --> 16:58.639
It also comes in Vietnamese.

16:58.739 --> 17:02.504
We have 13 languages for this book, and here's the Spanish version.

17:02.985 --> 17:17.745
So every clinic orders its own, but we've got lots of books that we think are, you know, especially for the younger children that are really appealing, that they'll really reach for.

17:18.721 --> 17:31.958
Um, these pictures with, these books with the pictures of babies, but also, um... Oh, that's quite nice.

17:32.239 --> 17:34.442
Oh, good.

17:34.462 --> 17:35.523
So you can keep talking.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.145
These are for younger babies.

17:37.165 --> 17:37.986
I multitask these things.

17:38.006 --> 17:38.527
Okay.

17:38.547 --> 17:39.729
Well, these are for younger babies.

17:39.769 --> 17:48.340
These are for six-month-olds and nine-month-olds, you know, because they're built for people with small hands, and they have faces, and they're very chewable.

17:48.607 --> 17:57.517
But they're also, I always point this out to doctors, they are engineered for people without pincer grasps, because babies don't have pincer grasps until they're about nine months old.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.619
When they grab, they use the whole hand.

17:59.659 --> 18:04.844
So if you open this book, the pages all separate, so you can get from page to page by doing this.

18:04.864 --> 18:08.228
You don't need to do this, which you can't do at all in a paper page book.

18:08.909 --> 18:12.032
There was a wonderful quote of yours, which is...

18:14.138 --> 18:15.740
repeated any number of different places.

18:15.880 --> 18:19.183
And, in fact, I used it in my proposal to Harper's on this book.

18:19.524 --> 18:26.411
Were you—and I can only paraphrase it, but were you—you say reading is as essential as food.

18:26.451 --> 18:35.040
You can't think of a child without—you think of a child without reading as you would think of a child without food and nourishment and medical care.

18:36.281 --> 18:36.822
Well, that's true.

18:36.842 --> 18:37.342
It's a waste.

18:37.783 --> 18:43.048
I mean, I don't know if you've looked at two-year-olds recently.

18:43.282 --> 18:48.687
And it's hard to look at two-year-olds because they are essentially completely uncooperative.

18:48.787 --> 18:51.850
Whatever it is you want them to do, they won't do, and they'll do the other thing.

18:52.390 --> 19:08.845
But two-year-olds, a reasonably bright, not brilliant, just a reasonably bright, normal two-year-old who has been read to, their level of engagement with books is very profound and very complicated and very intense.

19:09.225 --> 19:11.027
They use books as transitional objects.

19:11.311 --> 19:24.189
many of them, you know, they have one book that they carry everywhere, they take to bed with them, they want to hear the same books over and over and over, and they know exactly what belongs on every page, and they memorize them, and if you change a single word, the two-year-old corrects you.

19:24.570 --> 19:40.052
They have these incredibly intense, powerful relationships with, it can be hundreds of books, and when you think about that not being there, when you think about, and we're talking about children who just started talking, we're not talking about very sophisticated or very grown-up children, when you think about

19:40.775 --> 19:53.131
a two-year-old missing that, you know, not having any chance to sort of make those connections, to relate to books in that way, in that very powerful early way, something's just missing.

19:53.151 --> 20:01.922
It's just, you know, some tremendous opportunity has been lost, something which could make that child's brain grow.

20:03.144 --> 20:10.172
Years ago, we developed a poster that was going to hang in doctors' offices, and I can show it to you.

20:10.192 --> 20:10.613
It was a

20:10.913 --> 20:15.918
a doctor bunny listening to a patient, and I was supposed to write a jingle to go on it.

20:16.498 --> 20:21.563
And I wrote the jingle which said, this is something like, this is a message from your doctor's heart.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.026
Books help babies grow up smart.

20:25.046 --> 20:28.950
And I was told I couldn't use the word smart because it was judgmental.

20:29.611 --> 20:35.696
And I couldn't believe that I was, this was, you know, the publishing company, the underwriter said, you know, smart is a judgmental world.

20:36.937 --> 20:38.659
I work with a

20:38.993 --> 20:42.157
you know, inner city, fairly impoverished population.

20:42.577 --> 20:44.400
All these parents want their kids to be smart.

20:45.221 --> 20:46.001
It's not judgmental.

20:46.042 --> 20:47.503
People are delighted if you tell them.

20:47.523 --> 20:53.591
And most babies, most pediatricians secretly believe that most babies and most toddlers are very, very smart.

20:53.611 --> 20:54.332
They're very alert.

20:54.352 --> 20:55.213
They're very interested.

20:55.233 --> 20:57.716
They'll sort of suck up whatever you give them, good or bad.

20:57.976 --> 20:59.037
They want to know everything.

20:59.418 --> 21:01.180
You don't have to encourage them to learn.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.222
That's the developmental trajectory.

21:03.623 --> 21:07.988
And when you look at a two-year-old who is just missing all of this, has had no chance to

21:08.930 --> 21:14.337
memorize the books or learn the books or, you know, look at them, something's lost.

21:14.357 --> 21:18.502
And you don't get that window back in the same way you don't get it back for spoken language.

21:18.522 --> 21:19.764
You get other chances.

21:19.804 --> 21:23.488
It's not, you know, it's not that... You miss the train, you can't get it.

21:23.508 --> 21:23.608
Yeah.

21:24.089 --> 21:27.714
Yeah, but there's some moment... But you do get there earlier if you get the earlier train.

21:27.894 --> 21:30.177
But also some moment when this is just joy.

21:30.517 --> 21:34.482
You're not, it's not pedagogical, it's not forced, it's just

21:34.681 --> 21:43.413
You know, you've got this sponge-like brain and this child who's ready to memorize and ready to absorb all this, and it's just, you're not giving it.

21:43.453 --> 21:44.434
You're just skipping it.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.477
It seems very sad.

21:46.517 --> 21:53.767
And the two-year-olds are especially fun because they can do so much and they can memorize.

21:53.827 --> 22:02.038
You know, if you talk to a parent who's got a dinosaur-obsessed two-year-old or I had a truck-obsessed two-year-old and I have no interest in trucks,

22:02.525 --> 22:07.211
But there was a period there where we probably, he and I, could identify hundreds of trucks.

22:07.912 --> 22:12.619
You know, these are the world's most boring children's books are about trucks.

22:12.939 --> 22:16.124
And they come, there are thousands of them.

22:16.424 --> 22:19.068
My wife and I review children's books for a couple of newspapers.

22:19.088 --> 22:19.548
Oh, really?

22:20.009 --> 22:25.056
It's kind of a thing we do together, and I do eight of them a month, but it's amazing the truck books that come in.

22:25.457 --> 22:27.840
And they just, I send them out to the library.

22:27.860 --> 22:30.844
There's a series called Vernie Drives a Truck, which was,

22:31.111 --> 22:37.277
You know, you would read these aloud, and they would be like, trucks do many very important jobs.

22:37.297 --> 22:41.241
Trucks deliver groceries to the grocery store.

22:41.261 --> 22:42.423
Fire trucks.

22:42.443 --> 22:43.103
Fire trucks.

22:43.123 --> 22:43.664
Dump trucks.

22:44.385 --> 22:45.105
Absolutely.

22:45.125 --> 22:45.926
Cement trucks.

22:45.946 --> 22:46.907
I don't know what it is.

22:47.448 --> 22:57.338
I don't know what it is, but, and it's not that, you know, your life would be poorer if you couldn't name a hundred different trucks, but that intense level of engagement, that sort of

22:57.655 --> 23:02.820
Being a two-year-old and already being a specialist, learning a specialist vocabulary.

23:03.080 --> 23:10.687
There's a recent book that came in, and I can't think of the title, but it's a study of the brain, and it's a study of language.

23:11.388 --> 23:21.257
And the woman who wrote the book puts forth the, it's not a theory, but she says that the propensity for language is instinctive.

23:22.698 --> 23:26.802
I guess they had a chance to look at some feral children or whatever.

23:27.001 --> 23:33.834
And even though there was nobody to teach them language, I guess the ability is there.

23:33.894 --> 23:36.418
Obviously, the learning element comes in.

23:36.438 --> 23:42.489
Do you think that taking it to the next level, that reading is kind of an innate?

23:43.832 --> 23:44.694
Interesting question.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.054
I wonder.

23:45.615 --> 23:46.056
What do you think?

23:47.268 --> 23:56.037
Well, I mean, I'm thinking of, when you talk about these kids just reaching out for these books and responding to them without any, it's extraordinary.

23:56.277 --> 24:00.902
I mean, written language does develop independently in numerous cultures.

24:00.922 --> 24:01.342
It is amazing.

24:01.923 --> 24:02.243
It does.

24:02.704 --> 24:03.204
Yeah, it does.

24:03.624 --> 24:06.628
Which I can write about in this book here, to a small degree.

24:06.648 --> 24:16.077
But, which is why it is, what you're learning with this program totally fascinates me, I have to say.

24:16.293 --> 24:19.696
Is there a tactility to it as well?

24:19.796 --> 24:20.897
I mean, it sounds like it.

24:20.917 --> 24:21.958
Does it have to be an object?

24:22.599 --> 24:27.663
And I don't want to get into the debate about the electronic book, but it is relevant to the conversation.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.625
I think it has to be an object.

24:29.645 --> 24:40.195
I think, you know, there are an awful lot of ways, and I'm sure that I don't have to convince you, but there are an awful lot of ways in which there's nothing as satisfying as a book.

24:40.215 --> 24:43.498
And starting with the six-month-old who can chew it,

24:43.968 --> 24:47.532
and handle it and kind of master it and manipulate it.

24:47.572 --> 24:52.897
And then what we do is we move, even if you hear, say, books for an older, these are books for like a one-year-old.

24:52.917 --> 24:54.639
They're a little bigger and a little heavier.

24:54.699 --> 24:57.542
They're still indestructible, but they're a little more conceptual.

24:57.562 --> 25:00.285
You know, you have baby animals and a little more of a story.

25:01.146 --> 25:03.308
But these books don't all pop up.

25:03.328 --> 25:04.349
You need a pincer grasp.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.530
You need to turn the pages.

25:06.031 --> 25:10.195
That's important with kids, handling the book, controlling the book, manipulating the book.

25:10.445 --> 25:14.909
And then one of the really exciting things that happens when you turn two.

25:15.310 --> 25:17.252
Well, possessing a book, too, is a factor.

25:17.272 --> 25:17.732
Absolutely.

25:18.253 --> 25:21.436
But you've described quite, these kids take them.

25:21.456 --> 25:22.236
I'm sorry to interrupt.

25:22.256 --> 25:22.957
No, no, no.

25:23.017 --> 25:23.358
Go on.

25:23.818 --> 25:25.199
Having it in your home, owning it.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.981
And I love libraries.

25:27.041 --> 25:36.030
And one of the things we try to do is if the parents, once the parents are hooked, once they're saying, yeah, he really does like books, is direct them toward the library.

25:36.751 --> 25:39.253
But there's also something about owning.

25:39.723 --> 25:41.485
a certain number of them that are yours.

25:41.825 --> 25:43.267
Yeah, I know.

25:43.807 --> 25:49.974
But I think you've got to remember, a lot of these kids are growing up in homes with no books, no print.

25:50.815 --> 25:53.058
You don't get your information from print.

25:53.078 --> 25:55.220
You don't get your celebrity gossip from print.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.521
You don't get anything from print.

25:57.082 --> 25:59.825
I think it changes the character of the home, even a few books.

26:00.686 --> 26:04.330
What I was going to say about two-year-olds is that two-year-olds can turn paper pages.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.725
They have pincer graphs.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.467
So that's where we make that key transition.

26:07.527 --> 26:08.628
Somewhere right around there.

26:08.648 --> 26:09.949
It depends on how much you've been read to.

26:09.990 --> 26:15.976
A child who's growing up in a home full of books and has learned to be careful of books and how to handle them by two.

26:16.336 --> 26:20.621
A child who's not been exposed to paper pages as much, maybe it's going to be two and a half.

26:21.081 --> 26:25.606
But by two, they've definitely got the control, and they can turn the pages without ripping them.

26:26.206 --> 26:31.752
Although, one thing which really happened to me is that...

26:32.373 --> 26:35.718
I had this bruiser of a two-year-old in my office.

26:35.738 --> 26:36.358
I said, really?

26:37.740 --> 26:39.383
Sort of the Incredible Hulk.

26:39.403 --> 26:41.506
And I gave him a board book like this.

26:42.407 --> 26:44.790
It was clear to me that he was not ready for paper pages.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.693
And I said to the mom, I'm going to give him this board book.

26:46.753 --> 26:48.075
It's nice and sturdy.

26:48.615 --> 26:49.697
It'll last a long time.

26:49.737 --> 26:50.678
And she said, oh, no, it won't.

26:50.698 --> 26:55.305
And he shredded it in front of me, like Superman with the phone book.

26:55.325 --> 26:56.426
It's really funny.

26:57.568 --> 27:00.692
All right, for your child, we need books made out of metal.

27:00.976 --> 27:25.482
know board books won't do it but i think the tactile thing is really important i think that it's also what me for babies part of the appeal of the book is that if you wave the book at mom and mom's going to reach you that means you get to be on mom's lap and you get mom's voice and you get mom's one-on-one attention which is interesting very much what babies want i mean to you

27:26.170 --> 27:30.775
Once you get to three-year-olds or four-year-olds or five-year-olds, you have that electronic competition.

27:30.835 --> 27:33.597
You might have, you know, I want my video or I want my video game.

27:34.138 --> 27:40.785
But a six-month-old or a one-year-old or even a two-year-old would probably rather have the parent one-on-one than anything.

27:40.825 --> 27:47.532
You know, some of these are, you know, kids will scream or tear the house down just to get a parent paying attention, even if the parent's angry.

27:48.052 --> 27:52.937
So one of the things that you get is not just the tactile quality of the book, but you get to be

27:53.187 --> 27:59.014
on a parent's lap in physical contact with the parent, the parent looking at you, looking with you at the book, holding you.

27:59.535 --> 28:08.266
And I suspect that that's where some of those positive associations, even for people who can't quite identify it, that's where it comes from.

28:08.306 --> 28:16.697
Your first repeated exposure to the sound of someone reading aloud or to words on the page or to the object of a book is in this

28:16.981 --> 28:28.508
most safe, most protected, most familiar, you know, with the most important person in the world when you're a one-year-old, most important voice in the world, and the book is one of the ways you get that person to yourself.

28:28.869 --> 28:33.319
At what point does the content of the book become important, or does it in this

28:33.485 --> 28:35.688
in this window that you're talking about?

28:35.728 --> 28:45.440
I think that, you know, I think it's important from the beginning in the sense that I think, you know, you want faces for the youngest babies and then you want interesting things like animals and pictures of families.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.065
By the time the kids get to three, you're asking them if you can.

28:49.105 --> 28:52.990
You're bringing in two or three books and you're saying, you know, which one would you like?

28:53.030 --> 29:02.682
And one of the interesting things, talking of book ownership, that I've found again and again is if I bring in, you know, if I have a three-year-old or a four-year-old

29:03.016 --> 29:07.321
And I bring in... That's kind of like your doctor bag, right?

29:08.142 --> 29:11.046
Oh, my sample bag of books.

29:11.066 --> 29:18.595
Well, also because when I talk about... Oh, that's a great picture.

29:18.615 --> 29:21.078
I don't mean to interrupt your... Okay, that's all right.

29:21.098 --> 29:22.019
Oh, yeah, you're right.

29:22.600 --> 29:31.150
But so if I bring in three books and I say, you know, I want to choose one of these, and say the three-year-old looks at it and says...

29:31.585 --> 29:33.109
We have that one at my school.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.074
We have that one at my daycare.

29:35.154 --> 29:36.838
We have that one at my Head Start.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.763
That's the one that he wants, always.

29:39.404 --> 29:42.552
It's never, oh, we have this one at my school, so I'll take that one.

29:43.033 --> 29:47.063
It's always, if there's a book that they have at school and it gets read at school, they want to own it.

29:47.465 --> 29:48.326
They know that book.

29:48.507 --> 29:49.989
It's familiar.

29:50.069 --> 29:55.076
And it's sort of really interesting because I'm usually there saying, oh, well, if you already know this one, take that one.

29:55.096 --> 29:56.158
No, no, no, I want that one.

29:56.178 --> 29:56.559
But you know what?

29:56.599 --> 29:57.220
I'm the same way.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.682
I go into the library.

29:58.742 --> 30:12.042
If I go to Widener or wherever, which is why the library, you go to find a particular book, but it's always the one half a dozen volumes down that you never heard of before that's vastly more interesting.

30:12.062 --> 30:14.025
You take it out and you take it home or whatever.

30:14.506 --> 30:15.828
I have to own that book.

30:15.848 --> 30:16.729
I mean, I have...

30:17.030 --> 30:23.039
Do you have to possess multiple copies of some books?

30:23.159 --> 30:27.385
Some books I do, yeah.

30:28.226 --> 30:35.937
What was it that said Hebrew, I guess, in my first book?

30:35.957 --> 30:36.679
You have to have three.

30:36.779 --> 30:38.742
A gentleman must have three copies of every book.

30:38.842 --> 30:42.167
One is the collectible, one to read, and one to loan.

30:42.187 --> 30:42.807
To lend.

30:42.827 --> 30:44.590
To lend.

30:45.127 --> 30:47.049
Yeah, I have reading copies of some books.

30:49.212 --> 30:53.197
Books that are pretty, well, of course, variant editions with different, that's a whole different one.

30:53.217 --> 31:02.729
How about the, now this is not really serious, but how are there certain books that you feel you have to rescue if you see copies of them sort of randomly on a shelf?

31:02.749 --> 31:11.199
I have a chapter in there where I, shelf life, my shelf life chapter, where I talk about my favorite collection within a collection at home.

31:11.219 --> 31:12.501
It's called my orphan collection.

31:13.156 --> 31:18.262
the books that my wife Connie and I actually go out and rescue their discards from libraries.

31:18.423 --> 31:29.256
And the title of this book comes from an Emerson essay in the Dial magazine, which Emerson and I have the same birthday, which is May 25th.

31:29.316 --> 31:38.488
That's not overly relevant, but the fact is this, and the epigraph of this book is where the title for this, and we found that in an essay that had been

31:38.722 --> 31:44.150
And a bundle of dial magazines had been discarded at a bookseal.

31:44.170 --> 31:52.622
Well, these things are worth, never mind the monetary value, just the fact that this library had chosen to sell for five dollars this bundle.

31:52.722 --> 31:58.331
I mean, Emerson was the founder, Margaret Fuller was the founding editor, or was the contributor.

31:58.351 --> 32:05.421
And here's this extraordinary essay where Emerson refers to books as the splendors of letters.

32:05.975 --> 32:17.988
Sorry, I'm babbling here, but books that are discarded and about to, for me, it's like going to the pound, you know, and giving some animal a very uncertain future.

32:19.590 --> 32:21.672
It doesn't matter if it's, I like books that are read.

32:21.852 --> 32:26.197
I love books that have prior ownership and a history.

32:26.817 --> 32:27.998
It doesn't bother me at all.

32:28.019 --> 32:32.323
In fact, I kind of like annotations, and I don't know if you feel the same.

32:32.383 --> 32:34.125
I like to, if it's intelligent,

32:34.780 --> 32:37.665
Well, it depends on what they are.

32:37.885 --> 32:39.668
If it's a great rarity, you don't want to touch it.

32:39.749 --> 32:44.377
But on the other hand, a book that's pristine, as far as I'm concerned, has never been handled.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.280
So what's the point there?

32:46.921 --> 32:49.245
I don't know.

32:49.647 --> 32:50.709
We have lots of fun.

32:51.069 --> 32:52.852
I'm sorry we're jumping around the block.

32:53.813 --> 32:54.294
That's all right.

32:54.354 --> 32:56.137
And tell me, by the way, what your schedule is.

32:56.998 --> 32:57.939
If you're fine, I'm fine.

32:57.959 --> 32:58.520
I'm fine.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.985
And at some point, I'd love to walk you around and show you and introduce you to people.

33:02.005 --> 33:02.366
I would like that.

33:02.566 --> 33:05.731
And if it's okay, maybe we can have a follow-up at some point.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.635
And do you think Dr. Zuckerman would be... I could be delighted.

33:08.995 --> 33:10.217
I'd love to talk.

33:10.237 --> 33:13.662
I really plan a major treatment on this thing.

33:13.682 --> 33:14.163
Oh, good.

33:14.203 --> 33:17.528
Robert Coles I want to talk to, who I talked to before.

33:17.862 --> 33:26.351
And I also want to get into another concept, absolutely related, but I noticed that you're involved with that as well.

33:27.111 --> 33:43.828
Teaching medical students at a course where you teach them fiction, you know, how to read the classics and how you really believe, you know, we're talking about arguably the most intelligent, sensitive people in our culture.

33:44.429 --> 33:47.312
Everywhere I go, if I give talks or lectures or signings,

33:47.765 --> 33:55.133
I can always count on having a physician or two come up, and there'll be bibliophiles.

33:55.253 --> 33:57.035
And the specialty won't be medicine.

33:57.075 --> 33:59.958
It'll be something else.

33:59.978 --> 34:00.659
It'll be music.

34:00.679 --> 34:02.601
It'll be poetry.

34:02.621 --> 34:05.985
It'll be 18th century French.

34:06.005 --> 34:07.106
It doesn't matter.

34:07.486 --> 34:13.172
There must be something in the brain there, I'm sure.

34:13.212 --> 34:15.595
That'd be nice.

34:15.794 --> 34:21.102
How many physicians, such as yourself, are wonderful writers?

34:21.703 --> 34:21.923
Yeah.

34:21.943 --> 34:23.205
I mean, that's not a coincidence.

34:23.225 --> 34:23.646
No, it's not.

34:23.666 --> 34:30.897
After a while, the pattern is... And I see that you have theories on that as well, in fact.

34:30.957 --> 34:31.878
You need descriptions.

34:32.679 --> 34:37.687
There's a lot of metaphor involved in medicine, I guess.

34:37.707 --> 34:38.228
Yes, there is.

34:38.248 --> 34:39.550
I do think that's true.

34:39.590 --> 34:40.992
I also think that...

34:41.748 --> 34:58.470
Well, one of the talks that I give, I sometimes talk about the relationship between learning medicine and learning journalism in the sense of learning to ask rude questions or getting permission to ask rude questions.

34:58.590 --> 35:07.401
A large part of medical training, what they call taking a history, is walking into a room, meeting someone old enough to be your grandmother,

35:07.600 --> 35:13.268
and, you know, sitting down and within five minutes you're asking her questions, which no one would ask in polite company.

35:13.849 --> 35:26.947
And the fact that medicine attracts people who are interested in having the license to do that and then actually teaches them how to do it and rewards them for it, I think is in some way related to the impulse that drives many journalists.

35:27.007 --> 35:34.437
I mean, I know it would be, you know, I know it would be more polite not to ask you how you feel as you wait to be executed, but, hey, I'm allowed to ask that.

35:34.457 --> 35:35.038
I'm a journalist.

35:35.519 --> 35:36.460
It's my job.

35:37.047 --> 35:44.997
So I think there are overlaps, and certainly medicine is, there's a lot of plot.

35:45.037 --> 35:46.920
There's a lot of plot and a lot of detail.

35:47.140 --> 35:55.511
Kohl's, when I talked to him a few number of years ago, why would you teach a Tolstoy story to medical students?

35:55.531 --> 35:59.996
There was one story in particular, the death of Ivan Elyich.

36:00.036 --> 36:06.885
Not the death of Ivan Elyich, it's where a family is, they're angry at a grandparent who's

36:08.013 --> 36:21.949
eating sloppily, and so they say, we're going to feed you in a bowl, you know, like a toiletry type thing, and so that's fine, and then one day they come home and the child is making something, and I say, what are you making?

36:21.969 --> 36:34.003
Well, I'm making a bowl for you when you get older, so I can, you know, I'm not doing justice to this story and the way he told it, but, you know, and then he asks his medical students, what does that tell you about

36:34.507 --> 36:42.655
Whatever, you know, and how fiction can be so instructive, how stories can be instructive to medical students.

36:42.735 --> 36:51.263
There's a whole genre now of, I've seen any number of stories, of programs, everywhere.

36:51.423 --> 36:53.105
They just seem to be catching on.

36:53.305 --> 36:54.326
And mental humanity to people.

36:54.907 --> 36:56.848
The power to listen, I guess.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.650
Yeah.

36:58.670 --> 37:01.533
And empathy, I guess.

37:01.733 --> 37:02.674
And empathy.

37:02.873 --> 37:24.005
You know, medicine becomes more and more technological, and people are wrestling with the question of how to produce doctors with more skills in empathy and human relationships, because it's not been the pride of the profession all along.

37:24.025 --> 37:25.928
When you have a child, a patient come in.

37:27.055 --> 37:31.261
Do you talk about the reading over the past six months or whatever?

37:31.281 --> 37:34.345
Well, you talk about development.

37:34.886 --> 37:47.284
So what I try to do, and I usually do this when I get it right, when I do a physical, is I try to come into the room with a book, give the child a book, and then as I'm saying, you know, hi, how's he doing?

37:47.304 --> 37:48.826
Oh my gosh, she's gotten so big.

37:49.667 --> 37:53.132
Watch and see what the child's doing with the book and see what the parent says.

37:53.232 --> 37:56.016
And so, for example, I had these

37:56.519 --> 38:07.213
great 18-month-old twins the other day, and it was incredibly chaotic, because they were 18-month-old twins, and I had two different board books, and I came in with them, and I said to the model, okay, you know, who gets which?

38:07.294 --> 38:14.343
And she looked at them, and she said, oh, you know, he gets that one, because he loves animals, and his favorite book is some other, and he gets the other one.

38:14.363 --> 38:15.905
And I said, so, you know, they like books.

38:16.065 --> 38:23.235
Oh, and she was, you know, she started talking and boasting about, you know, how much they love the books, and this one knows this book about animal sounds by heart.

38:23.637 --> 38:28.744
And the truth is that, first of all, that's very reassuring from the point of view of what kind of childhood they're having.

38:28.764 --> 38:40.381
But second of all, if her 18-month-old knows the Animal Sound book by heart, then I don't need to say to her, okay, by 18 months, he should have some words besides mama and dada.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.042
Now, does he?

38:41.082 --> 38:45.929
Now, when he says those words, are you the only one who can understand them?

38:46.149 --> 38:50.235
And those are kind of standard pediatric developmental questions, because...

38:50.401 --> 39:01.714
between one year and two years, part of our standard brief is we're supposed to pick up speech delay, we're supposed to pick up developmental delay, a child who's not learning to talk on time, we're supposed to refer.

39:01.774 --> 39:05.138
There's a whole lot of imperatives that are part of our practice.

39:05.739 --> 39:15.370
When I do this right, by having the book in there, by having the parent talk about the child's skills with books, by watching the child with the book, I get those questions answered.

39:15.410 --> 39:17.573
And so I had another child

39:18.025 --> 39:20.228
Animal sounds are very popular, too.

39:20.248 --> 39:26.917
I had a two-year-old yesterday who I gave him a book, and the father starts pointing at the pictures and saying, what does a dog say?

39:26.957 --> 39:28.339
And the kid goes, woof, woof.

39:28.359 --> 39:29.320
It was a pretty good woof.

39:29.921 --> 39:32.945
I mean, I could understand the woof, and what does the sheep say?

39:32.965 --> 39:34.067
Bah, bah.

39:34.087 --> 39:45.923
And again, so that tells you a lot as a doctor about, first of all, the parent's interaction with the child and whether the parent kind of knows what he's doing with a two-year-old and has reasonable expectations, and it

39:46.190 --> 39:49.373
Also tells you something about the child's hearing and the child's cognitive development.

39:49.393 --> 39:50.695
And yeah, he's got words.

39:50.835 --> 39:55.980
You know what you're telling me is that the book is as helpful to you, the physician, as it is.

39:57.582 --> 39:58.343
When it works right.

39:58.683 --> 40:00.045
When we do it right, I think it is.

40:00.105 --> 40:01.887
That's part of our case at Reach Out to Me.

40:01.907 --> 40:02.567
That's pretty interesting.

40:02.587 --> 40:04.770
Well, because we're adding something to a visit.

40:04.790 --> 40:08.133
There are so many imperatives that you're supposed to fulfill in these visits.

40:08.153 --> 40:13.699
Talk about discipline, talk about nutrition, growth, weight and height, all of this stuff.

40:13.898 --> 40:22.547
that one of the reasons this works is that people who get used to doing this with the book find out that they can use the book for a whole bunch of things.

40:23.147 --> 40:28.413
In the same way that if you've got, you know, there are all of these rules that you learn.

40:28.493 --> 40:34.899
For example, when you're two, you're supposed to have a vocabulary of a couple of hundred words.

40:35.840 --> 40:42.707
And when you speak, about 50% of your language is supposed to be intelligible to someone other than your parent.

40:43.160 --> 40:48.025
So if you bring your two-year-old to me and some of his words are garbled, that's not a red flag.

40:48.065 --> 40:49.887
I don't have to send you for evaluation.

40:50.327 --> 41:00.057
If you bring your two-year-old and all of his words are garbled and I can't understand a single one, I need to test your child's hearing and I need to have you have a speech evaluation.

41:00.197 --> 41:09.066
And if I don't do that as the pediatrician and it turns out that your child can't hear well and we go another year and we lose that window in which speech is formed,

41:09.670 --> 41:11.172
I'm not doing my job right.

41:11.432 --> 41:21.105
How essential is, and you must have cases where the parents are illiterate and can't read to the child.

41:21.706 --> 41:22.888
That's a really good question.

41:22.908 --> 41:23.729
Does that happen?

41:23.749 --> 41:32.320
Yeah, it's a really good question, and we've tried a lot here at Reach Out and Read to link up with adult literacy and family literacy organizations.

41:34.358 --> 41:43.447
Well, I have a lot of answers to this question, none of which are very satisfactory, and I'm sure you know all of the horror statistics on how many adults in this country.

41:43.487 --> 41:49.073
Most adults in this country are not actually unable to sign their names.

41:49.153 --> 41:55.539
Most of them can sign their names, or they can figure out a word on a page, but many of them can't go much further than that.

41:55.980 --> 42:01.345
They don't read fluently, and they don't read for pleasure, and there's no real proficiency.

42:01.460 --> 42:09.371
I mean, 37 percent of the adult population in Washington, D.C., according to Ralph Nader's group, which is helping with this Save D.C.

42:09.511 --> 42:12.896
Libraries thing, is functionally illiterate.

42:12.916 --> 42:13.057
Right.

42:13.077 --> 42:13.758
37 percent.

42:13.778 --> 42:14.118
Yeah.

42:14.138 --> 42:15.720
That's, you know, a lot.

42:15.740 --> 42:16.421
That's a lot.

42:16.461 --> 42:17.102
That's a lot.

42:17.783 --> 42:20.006
But they can sign their names, is what I think.

42:20.046 --> 42:26.155
I mean, I have patients coming from the Sudan at the International Clinic who actually sign their names with their thoughts.

42:26.255 --> 42:29.560
That's not what illiteracy looks like in this country, by and large.

42:30.198 --> 42:32.862
We have people who can fake it, too, and pass.

42:32.882 --> 42:34.324
We have people who can do it all the time.

42:35.706 --> 42:45.882
But as far as with the very little babies, I think, you know, you can just still tell the parent, hold them on your lap, look at the pictures, you know, what does the dog say, what's the baby do.

42:46.663 --> 42:54.475
We don't, in medicine, it's been studied numerous times, we generally don't know which of our patients can read and which of our patients can't read easily.

42:55.016 --> 42:58.922
And we don't generally ask it.

42:59.695 --> 43:04.821
And when I talk to doctors about this, most people feel uncomfortable asking that question.

43:05.121 --> 43:06.543
But I suspect you can perceive it.

43:07.464 --> 43:21.299
Well, you sometimes can, but I think you often... I don't know the point of that question, but I'm just... Yeah, you sometimes have an idea, but it's one of the things that we actually really need to get better at is figuring out how to ask that question.

43:21.319 --> 43:26.184
I mean, there's a lot of received wisdom in medicine about how to ask awkward questions.

43:26.245 --> 43:29.348
For example, you don't ask, so how much do you drink?

43:30.003 --> 43:31.124
I mean, that doesn't work.

43:31.144 --> 43:33.107
My doctor asked me that question.

43:33.127 --> 43:33.407
Well.

43:34.568 --> 43:38.893
She says that I answer honestly, but a little bit of wine here and there.

43:39.013 --> 43:49.506
If you are talking to someone you don't know well, and you are concerned that that person may have a drinking problem, so how much do you drink is not a recommended question to get an honest answer.

43:49.566 --> 43:52.810
People rarely answer by saying, you know, I'm drunk every night.

43:52.830 --> 43:53.030
Right.

43:53.150 --> 43:57.495
So instead, there is, for example, there's something called, there are four questions.

43:57.965 --> 44:02.250
that you're supposed to ask, and if you get a yes to any one of them, it's a red flag.

44:02.290 --> 44:03.711
There's probably a drinking problem.

44:04.012 --> 44:05.493
Ask some more questions.

44:05.513 --> 44:10.799
But the questions are, they start with, so have you ever tried to cut down on your drinking?

44:12.501 --> 44:14.984
Do people ever annoy you about your drinking?

44:16.005 --> 44:18.428
Do you ever need an eye-opener in the morning?

44:18.788 --> 44:20.931
It's a real drinking problem.

44:20.951 --> 44:21.171
Right.

44:21.404 --> 44:23.827
So, but those are, they're less direct ways.

44:23.928 --> 44:31.758
So, doctors that I talk to are usually pretty uncomfortable about asking, so, you know, can you read, or do you have any problem with reading?

44:31.778 --> 44:33.080
Whether or not people would present that.

44:33.100 --> 44:35.424
I think that would be almost harder to ask on the drinking question.

44:35.444 --> 44:36.705
That's what doctors say?

44:36.725 --> 44:37.386
Don't you think so?

44:37.446 --> 44:41.973
Well, it's interesting because so much of our training... Because that's driving to what people perceive as intelligence.

44:42.754 --> 44:45.117
Yeah, but I routinely ask.

44:45.485 --> 44:51.493
mothers with new babies, whether they used drugs during the pregnancy or drank during the pregnancy or smoked during the pregnancy.

44:51.993 --> 44:55.978
And I don't feel embarrassed asking it, and I also... Yeah, because you're concerned about the child at this point.

44:55.998 --> 44:56.319
Right.

44:56.499 --> 45:03.848
But I also routinely ask, you know, adolescents people who I hardly know how many sexual partners they have or what they do with them.

45:04.389 --> 45:07.813
All I mean is we feel a certain professional entitlement to ask

45:08.266 --> 45:09.548
fairly personal questions.

45:09.568 --> 45:12.933
This one worries us, and I think we need to figure out how to ask it.

45:13.073 --> 45:15.296
But that's right in there in that league, isn't it?

45:15.596 --> 45:17.519
About sexual activity, about drinking.

45:18.300 --> 45:20.143
I hadn't thought of it.

45:20.163 --> 45:27.754
It's actually more complicated because many people who don't read proficiently think they do.

45:28.374 --> 45:37.227
Some of them are covering it up and hiding it and lying, but I think that many people who can't... Okay, we're going again.

45:38.371 --> 45:39.613
That's the same tape, right?

45:39.633 --> 45:41.996
That's the same tape, right where I left off.

45:42.437 --> 45:42.577
Oh.

45:43.198 --> 45:45.501
Oh, I see, the machine clicked, not the tape.

45:45.641 --> 45:49.907
The machine must have, the battery, which was fresh, must have just run out of gas.

45:50.769 --> 45:50.829
Oh.

45:50.849 --> 45:53.312
So instead of changing the battery, I just changed the machine.

45:55.455 --> 45:56.417
I see.

45:56.897 --> 46:01.845
I was going to say something else.

46:01.865 --> 46:02.225
Sorry, go ahead.

46:02.245 --> 46:03.387
I don't remember what I was saying.

46:05.289 --> 46:07.112
If it seems that I haven't asked you a lot of

46:07.244 --> 46:08.506
biographical questions.

46:08.546 --> 46:15.798
I have all that, and I'm looking for some nice fresh quotes that I think we're getting.

46:19.163 --> 46:26.575
You had mentioned the board books and how the ten books over the five years, so you do have a progressive transition that is measured?

46:26.595 --> 46:34.888
Yes, starting with the board books, moving on to the simpler books with paper pages, and then especially as the children get

46:35.830 --> 46:43.820
get older and can choose more complicated story books, books with more words on the page.

46:46.163 --> 46:47.845
This is a very cool one.

46:48.245 --> 46:55.434
This one, actually, I work in Dorchester, and about a third of our population at my health center is Vietnamese.

46:55.454 --> 46:58.598
And this is a book which, when we first got it,

46:59.422 --> 47:01.125
It has too many words on the page.

47:01.165 --> 47:06.053
We don't usually give books with quite as much text, especially since it's about the Vietnamese family.

47:06.073 --> 47:08.677
I was afraid we'd be giving it to people who didn't read English easily.

47:09.358 --> 47:14.546
But it's about Vietnamese girls on their first days at an American school.

47:15.147 --> 47:23.100
And the pictures were so evocative for our population of the Vietnamese girls at the school that we still use it.

47:23.280 --> 47:23.881
We still get it.

47:24.382 --> 47:25.163
It's a nice book.

47:25.584 --> 47:26.425
But, yeah.

47:26.607 --> 47:34.698
You know, once you can handle paper pages and, you know, parents are a little more adventurous, there's a lot of books out there.

47:35.099 --> 47:42.990
And then there's that transition to the library, and then there's school, which if the schools survive and their libraries survive, there's more and more books.

47:44.031 --> 47:46.054
Do you have a process for measuring the results?

47:47.135 --> 47:47.436
We do.

47:47.576 --> 47:54.285
What we have, we have a collection of studies, all of which were peer-reviewed and published in the

47:55.042 --> 48:01.289
medical literature in which a number of different researchers around the country had studied a couple of different outcomes.

48:02.010 --> 48:12.161
They started out studying parent attitudes, which they did by asking parents, what are your favorite things to do with your child or what are your child's favorite activities?

48:12.221 --> 48:17.927
And then they would score them according to whether or not they spontaneously mentioned reading books because

48:18.329 --> 48:20.713
You can't really ask parents, do you read to your child?

48:20.733 --> 48:22.496
There's too much social desirability.

48:22.516 --> 48:28.185
People know they're supposed to say yes, so you have to ask them, what's everything that you do routinely at bedtime?

48:28.225 --> 48:29.988
And then you listen to see whether they say they read.

48:30.028 --> 48:38.381
And there are a number of studies, and I can give you copies of some of them, to show that the children who participate in this program and parents are much more likely to mention.

48:38.562 --> 48:39.283
Oh, yeah.

48:39.303 --> 48:41.486
Documentary backup.

48:41.506 --> 48:42.548
Load you up with data.

48:42.680 --> 48:44.662
It can never be too much from my standpoint.

48:44.682 --> 48:54.955
And there are also three published studies now looking at both expressive and receptive language in a group of children getting the Reach Out and Read program and persisting group of kids.

48:54.975 --> 48:55.716
And is it searchable?

48:55.736 --> 48:56.637
Like you have these online?

48:56.818 --> 48:57.599
I can give them to you.

48:57.679 --> 48:59.241
We have the research summary.

48:59.261 --> 49:00.262
I'd love to have this stuff.

49:00.282 --> 49:02.745
Yeah.

49:02.765 --> 49:09.053
So, yeah, we actually, as interventions go, we have good data.

49:09.073 --> 49:12.417
I would say about our data that

49:13.527 --> 49:19.094
inadvertently, some of what we're studying is what I would call the barrenness of the background.

49:19.134 --> 49:26.923
That is to say, ten books in the home shouldn't make such a big difference.

49:28.005 --> 49:32.811
If my kids had ten more books in the home, you wouldn't notice it.

49:33.832 --> 49:38.758
So I think when we're seeing the effects that we're seeing, one of the things that we're studying almost inadvertently

49:39.042 --> 49:47.030
is how many children are growing up in print-poor or actually print-free environments, and not just very poor children either.

49:47.050 --> 50:00.685
I think that there are... Some of what we're doing is we're getting the book in early, and we're talking about reading aloud to the six-month-old, and maybe the parents would have thought of it when the child was three, but wouldn't have thought of it this early, and we're doing them a favor by starting them early.

50:00.725 --> 50:08.273
But some of what we're seeing, I think, is that a lot of children who may not even be economically very impoverished

50:08.557 --> 50:14.644
are growing up in very impoverished environments in terms of the stimulation that's there is electronic.

50:15.485 --> 50:18.388
And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work.

50:18.989 --> 50:21.532
It doesn't, you don't learn language from the TV.

50:21.572 --> 50:25.517
So you do think that, and I don't, again, want to make a big deal out of this.

50:25.537 --> 50:34.547
I have three chapters in the future enough on that already, but the book does make, is... If you could learn language from the television set,

50:35.843 --> 50:44.234
From my point of view as a pediatrician serving the population I serve, it would be only good news because my patients are exposed to so much television.

50:44.655 --> 50:55.069
If television made you smart and taught you language, I mean, I love television myself, but if television made children smart and taught them language, it would be great news.

50:55.430 --> 51:00.096
It would be wonderful news for the kids that I take care of and their opportunities when they get to school.

51:00.852 --> 51:02.714
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to.

51:02.754 --> 51:18.150
We had a lecturer at our conference this year, a woman, a scientist from the University of Washington, Washington State, named Patricia Kuhl, KUHL, and she talked about language acquisition.

51:18.190 --> 51:30.403
She showed us some of the videotapes they make of babies and the whole question of the way that newborns can recognize all the different sounds in the world and that then you

51:31.379 --> 51:35.067
You concentrate down on the sounds that are actually used in your language.

51:35.648 --> 51:41.860
And she showed us the way that the exposure to a little bit of spoken Chinese changed baby sound recognition patterns.

51:42.221 --> 51:49.416
But then they tried to do the whole same thing with videotapes and having the babies here exposed to the same sounds on videotapes.

51:49.436 --> 51:50.719
And it didn't work.

51:50.799 --> 51:52.442
You don't learn to talk.

51:52.878 --> 51:55.661
You know, what do you make of this Harry Potter phenomenon?

51:55.681 --> 51:57.283
I mean, really, it's books.

51:57.744 --> 52:02.029
The Boston Globe said when one of the books came out, the day the video screens went dark.

52:02.890 --> 52:04.732
You know, the day the kids.

52:04.752 --> 52:08.176
The way they hunger for this object.

52:08.817 --> 52:08.997
Oh, yeah.

52:09.017 --> 52:18.489
And what you see is they're grabbing... My daughter, Nicole, when she had this little program with the girls' club, my wife and I gave a bunch of children's books and we reviewed books.

52:19.610 --> 52:20.391
Yeah, yeah.

52:20.411 --> 52:21.332
It was like

52:21.498 --> 52:22.659
Better than candy.

52:22.700 --> 52:23.901
Better than treats.

52:24.522 --> 52:25.763
I don't think that's changed.

52:25.844 --> 52:36.818
I mean, children, even children who play video games and are confident with computers and watch TV, there is still something for many of them about the book.

52:36.838 --> 52:41.564
And there's a sort of, I think that addiction, that addicted quality persists.

52:41.584 --> 52:44.347
I mean, I have three kids, and I recognize it in all of them.

52:45.368 --> 52:46.530
I don't think that's changed.

52:46.590 --> 52:49.233
And Harry Potter's, I love the Harry Potter stuff.

52:49.253 --> 52:51.336
I haven't read any of them, but there are no illustrations.

52:51.704 --> 52:52.705
They're quite complicated.

52:52.725 --> 52:53.967
There's no interactivity.

52:54.027 --> 52:57.932
It's bigger than any one of my books, and my books are 600 pages.

52:57.952 --> 52:58.373
Yeah.

52:58.393 --> 53:00.636
There's not this one, but... And they're, you know what they are?

53:00.656 --> 53:04.821
They're old-fashioned school stories, like the stories that many of us grew up reading.

53:04.841 --> 53:11.930
You know, they're boarding, there seems to be, even for children in this country, something so irresistible about the idea of, you know, being sent off to a boarding school.

53:12.411 --> 53:12.811
Yeah.

53:12.831 --> 53:16.296
And, you know, having to get along with the other kids and get along with the teachers.

53:16.336 --> 53:16.436
Yeah.

53:17.077 --> 53:21.002
So it's a little early yet, 15 years, to really have any kind of,

53:21.320 --> 53:28.186
studies that might say how these kids would have measured otherwise if they hadn't... That's hard to do.

53:28.226 --> 53:30.188
I'll show you what we've got.

53:30.208 --> 53:32.510
I don't want to claim more for our data than they do.

53:32.610 --> 53:40.297
The problem with long-term follow-up studies in the populations we serve is just that there's so many other factors come into play.

53:41.298 --> 53:49.825
How are you going to look at the impact of getting ten books from the doctor between six months and five years if there's also been, oh, I don't know, three changes of custody or...

53:50.108 --> 53:56.958
five different schools or, you know, many... That's going to be a hard study to do.

53:57.138 --> 54:08.314
And, you know, in a way, my hope is, my aspiration for children is that, again, it's not a case of, you know, miss the train and it's gone forever.

54:09.475 --> 54:19.069
I don't like to think... I think the children who grow up without books and without being read aloud to are behind in a disadvantage when they come to school and that they're less likely...

54:19.285 --> 54:21.848
to learn to read on schedule and their language support.

54:22.409 --> 54:26.734
I don't, with my whole heart, I don't want to say, and that's it.

54:27.596 --> 54:38.950
You know, I want to believe that there's enough plasticity and enough potential that if you find the right ways to teach and you find the right environment in the school, that it's more work and more effort for everyone.

54:39.270 --> 54:45.078
But I want to believe that those children can also be readers and can, you know, can learn and be smart.

54:45.098 --> 54:48.482
And we haven't even talked at all about your own writing and how...

54:48.850 --> 55:00.189
your work as a physician and a pediatrician and as a pioneer in this Reach Out Read program, does this work its way into your own... Well, certainly the work as a physician does.

55:00.509 --> 55:03.995
I mean, a lot of what I've written... Particularly your fiction, I would say.

55:04.015 --> 55:12.569
Yeah, a lot of the fiction that I write is connected in some way to my work as a physician, partly just because there's sort of so much plot and so much incident.

55:12.589 --> 55:13.430
It's so tempting.

55:13.971 --> 55:14.993
And also because...

55:15.310 --> 55:24.123
For reasons of patient confidentiality, there are lots of great things I see that I would never use in journalism where you have to keep the details the same.

55:24.904 --> 55:27.448
So you save it and you make it into fiction.

55:27.848 --> 55:37.042
I don't know exactly how... I mean, I can see the ways that Reach Out and Read and working with Reach Out and Read influenced me as I was watching my youngest child grow up.

55:37.062 --> 55:39.085
It certainly changed my perspective.

55:39.125 --> 55:44.052
I don't know how it shaped me as a writer, except that I have written about Reach Out and Read.

55:46.158 --> 55:55.812
I mean, I think you would find if you went wandering around this office that most of the people here believe that they were profoundly shaped in various ways by books.

55:56.773 --> 56:11.113
And working on this program has made me see more clearly the gaps and what happens to people who are sort of just left out of the print universe.

56:11.133 --> 56:12.154
It's just not real to them.

56:12.174 --> 56:12.996
That would be wonderful.

56:15.239 --> 56:15.439
Thank you.

56:15.790 --> 56:16.651
How are we doing here?

56:17.532 --> 56:17.973
Very good.

56:19.074 --> 56:23.399
Now, what this will do when it gets to the end of the tape, it will automatically reverse and record in the other direction.

56:23.499 --> 56:26.002
They're really wonderful little things.

56:26.663 --> 56:32.871
And I haven't lost an interview yet, so there's no... Did you want to show me around a little bit?

56:32.891 --> 56:33.271
Yes, let's do it.

56:33.291 --> 56:38.177
And then if it's okay, what I'd like to do is go home and transcribe the tape and get going on what I want to do.

56:38.397 --> 56:40.600
And then if it's okay, maybe we could do some follow-up.

56:42.841 --> 56:59.861
They're a lot larger than they appear to be.

57:05.327 --> 57:07.870
Can I introduce you to someone?

57:08.542 --> 57:09.663
Hi, Matt Dino.

57:09.683 --> 57:11.165
Nice to meet you.

57:11.185 --> 57:20.676
He is a writer who writes about books and reading and readers and libraries, and he's writing a book about... My reading book.

57:20.697 --> 57:21.918
And he's interested in that.

57:22.379 --> 57:22.819
Oh, really?

57:23.200 --> 57:23.960
Oh, very.

57:23.980 --> 57:24.922
Matt is interested.

57:25.062 --> 57:25.923
Very interested.

57:26.323 --> 57:30.128
Matt is, well, now he is our... I'm taping this, okay?

57:30.188 --> 57:30.869
Just so you know it.

57:30.889 --> 57:31.189
Sure.

57:31.209 --> 57:34.653
He's now our Director of Government Relations and External Affairs.

57:34.793 --> 57:37.857
He works with the federal government and with

57:38.444 --> 57:47.916
a lot of our important relationships with major organizations and other initiatives statewide, federal.

57:48.276 --> 57:52.262
But actually, tell them where you come from before you would reach out and reach out, what you used to do.

57:52.282 --> 58:07.641
I was with the Books for Kids Foundation, a small literacy organization in New York that got donations of children's books from publishers and forwarded them on to programs like Reach Out and Read that sort of

58:08.009 --> 58:08.850
kids in need of books.

58:08.910 --> 58:14.497
So that's actually how I found out about Reach Out and Read and was looking to relocate up here back to Boston.

58:14.517 --> 58:15.018
Do you have a card?

58:15.679 --> 58:17.661
Yeah, many of them.

58:17.681 --> 58:20.965
I might want to follow up a little bit with you.

58:21.065 --> 58:21.486
Oh, good.

58:21.506 --> 58:21.826
Super.

58:21.846 --> 58:22.908
Yeah, excellent.

58:22.928 --> 58:26.472
But you notice the list of the House of Representatives on the wall.

58:26.652 --> 58:28.194
Yeah, of Congress, color-coded.

58:28.875 --> 58:29.876
Yellow are supporters.

58:31.599 --> 58:31.859
Green.

58:31.959 --> 58:33.561
What is green?

58:34.300 --> 58:38.626
The yellow are supporters by signing on to a letter in support of our request.

58:38.706 --> 58:44.053
Green are members of the Appropriations Committee that help in other ways to help us get our funding.

58:44.093 --> 58:46.075
I don't see a color for those who are opposed.

58:47.016 --> 58:48.078
No, we don't have a color.

58:48.118 --> 58:51.702
I can't imagine that anyone would come out in opposition to this.

58:51.802 --> 58:55.347
Well, thanks in large part to Matt and the people who work with.

58:55.597 --> 59:00.945
We're sort of proud to have very bipartisan support, both in the Senate and in the House.

59:01.265 --> 59:03.769
The photos are bipartisan photos.

59:03.809 --> 59:04.370
Here we go.

59:04.570 --> 59:06.212
Well, there's Hillary Clinton over there.

59:06.252 --> 59:10.058
I'm sure Barbara, well, not Barbara, Laura Bush must be around.

59:10.078 --> 59:11.800
Yeah, there she is right there.

59:11.820 --> 59:13.703
This is a Republican senator from Kansas.

59:13.723 --> 59:16.307
This is a Republican senator from Texas.

59:16.347 --> 59:18.149
That's Kay Hutchison Bailey.

59:18.189 --> 59:20.333
And there's Ted Kennedy.

59:20.833 --> 59:23.477
But...

59:23.710 --> 59:25.212
Well, that's important, isn't it?

59:25.232 --> 59:25.612
It's bipartisan.

59:25.633 --> 59:36.607
It's bipartisan, and it's also... We're probably, well, we're the only national organization talking about very young children in all of the book and literacy and education.

59:36.667 --> 59:45.118
We're the only ones who really are aiming at children, not children in preschools, not children in schools, six months to five years, children before they get to school.

59:45.138 --> 59:46.680
And...

59:47.386 --> 59:55.775
It had a lot to do with sort of keeping us addressing that and making sure that people hear us addressing that at federal level and also at state level.

59:56.756 --> 59:59.979
Making sure they invest in us as well.

59:59.999 --> 01:00:00.179
Great.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:01.500
Fabulous.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.504
Well, you have, what, 2,000 or so affiliates now?

01:00:05.524 --> 01:00:08.287
We have more than 2,000 sites around the country now.

01:00:09.168 --> 01:00:10.670
That's amazing.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.372
And so how many children do you think roughly participate?

01:00:14.894 --> 01:00:15.635
Two million.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:16.736
Two million a year.

01:00:16.756 --> 01:00:16.836
Wow.

01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:18.001
Totally.
