00:02.647 --> 00:10.438
I'm merely referring to these two women as representing sort of two sides of the coin, like Punch and Columbine.

00:15.564 --> 00:19.730
They're an act, to my mind, and an act of relentless self-promoters.

00:20.872 --> 00:26.359
And...

00:26.879 --> 00:30.163
But it's distressing to see the audience which they reach.

00:30.504 --> 00:34.029
You know, something like The Book Collector, we should perhaps get a little ice for that.

00:35.090 --> 00:42.680
Something like The Book Collector has been, it's got a subscription rate of, I mean, a subscription list of 1,500, 1,700.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.544
You look at the Papers of the Book of the Society of America, 1,500 copies.

00:45.564 --> 00:48.108
I mean, these are just miserably small amounts.

00:48.368 --> 00:52.954
The Book Collector advertising, not that I advertise, I mean, I would advertise if I ever decided to promote myself.

00:53.238 --> 01:06.278
value for money, you're only reaching 1,500 people, but they are the right 1,500, and yet Nichols Barker can't charge any more than a certain amount for an ad there, because he's only got this miserable subscription rate.

01:06.798 --> 01:13.068
I mean, it's value for money compared to Biblio, which I think is a despicable rag, which I know you write for.

01:13.088 --> 01:16.473
They charge this immense amount of money, and what are you reaching?

01:16.513 --> 01:17.895
You're reaching just the

01:18.854 --> 01:22.500
If you want to sell books to stupid people, it's a great way to do it.

01:22.701 --> 01:24.284
But I view that as a con game.

01:24.344 --> 01:28.050
And the booksellers who are thinking, you know, it's the Internet marketing, this reaching out.

01:28.070 --> 01:31.897
The AB is constantly wringing its hands about how can we make book collecting more appealing.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.964
You know, there's no point in making book collecting more appealing.

01:35.984 --> 01:38.008
There are always a small fit but few.

01:38.088 --> 01:39.951
And why should you, is it really...

01:40.252 --> 01:44.277
It reminds me of these National Library Week things where getting people out to read.

01:44.297 --> 01:45.920
I mean, there are people who like to read, there are people who don't.

01:45.980 --> 01:54.171
I don't think you should keep people in willful illiteracy because, of course, especially if you have a democracy, they damn well better be able to read the ballot.

01:54.191 --> 01:59.878
They ought to be able to read a newspaper or inquire some information, although they have no critical judgment to judge.

02:00.479 --> 02:04.384
And, you know, you look at these ballot measures, which are just, you know, it's all in legalese.

02:04.404 --> 02:06.307
No one can be expected to do that sort of thing.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.288
But beyond that,

02:07.538 --> 02:11.422
Those people who actually want to read books, I'm not out to promote more reading.

02:11.442 --> 02:16.588
It's one of the problems with Chernofsky's AB, which again, I mean, that's even crappier than Biblio.

02:16.989 --> 02:21.133
It's complete, well, he's going to go bankrupt because, of course, he's been greedy.

02:21.234 --> 02:25.158
His big mistake is charging much too much money for his advertisements there.

02:25.438 --> 02:28.502
But people who use the computers now, they have put him out of business.

02:28.522 --> 02:31.986
Exactly, they're going to put him out, but it's partly his own fault that people got used to him.

02:32.006 --> 02:33.107
I mean, it's so cheap.

02:33.273 --> 02:41.064
You look at the British one, the book dealer, vastly better done, actual information of real value to booksellers written by intelligent people.

02:41.104 --> 02:46.311
And they charge, I think that's like a quarter of what Chernofsky does to advertise.

02:46.552 --> 02:48.535
And it's a convenient little thing that you can carry.

02:48.555 --> 02:55.905
I mean, there will still be the quoters, the sort of my quoters who buy something at a garage sale and have 500 or 1,000 books and read through it.

02:56.105 --> 02:59.889
the thing, and those people won't be affected, but Chernovsky has priced those people out of the market.

03:00.089 --> 03:17.007
Those people, of course, I've talked to some of them, they think Chernovsky is just this quack for, you know, he believes that any book, well, this is, I mean, not to say, I don't take this as an anti-Semitic remark, but there is the Jewish people of the book feeling.

03:17.027 --> 03:25.656
If you look at uncritical adulation of the book, it is something, possibly to the credit of Jewish people brought up, they cannot throw out a book

03:26.260 --> 03:30.424
And many another person finds it a little easier to throw it at a book.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.428
Now that's an admirable thing as far as, the Chinese are the same way.

03:33.748 --> 03:39.414
Any little scrap of book with writing on it floating across the street as a rag is a precious relic.

03:39.814 --> 03:40.956
That's an admirable thing.

03:41.016 --> 03:42.357
It helps for the conservation book.

03:42.397 --> 03:45.501
What it isn't admirable for is critical judgment of books.

03:45.521 --> 03:49.365
To Chernovsky, all books are equal, getting the right book to the right person at the right time.

03:49.605 --> 03:53.449
Chernovsky is not a, he's probably the stupidest person in the book of trade.

03:53.615 --> 03:54.436
Well, I never remember.

03:54.496 --> 03:56.759
I've got to see the lucubraceous stuff that he writes there.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.040
I mean, he's a total idiot.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.503
He has no judgment about game or anyone else.

04:00.543 --> 04:02.546
I mean, I'm one of the few people who actually reads the stuff.

04:02.626 --> 04:08.112
I'm stopping my subscription, though, because time is too... Yeah, it's just a complete waste of time.

04:08.293 --> 04:08.793
Cheers.

04:08.813 --> 04:12.778
Thank you.

04:12.798 --> 04:18.525
But if he had more discrimination, as, say, somebody like Nicholas Parker or Arthur Freeman does, you would have...

04:19.096 --> 04:21.921
Yes, we get this from our next-door neighbor, another reason for living cheaply.

04:22.341 --> 04:25.266
Her father has seven chateaus.

04:25.527 --> 04:26.047
Really?

04:26.268 --> 04:27.129
It's very nice.

04:28.091 --> 04:31.536
Well, this is their cheapest, poorest wine.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.630
That's another, I should have actually told you, the one further ingredient when I told you I sold books in completely the wrong way.

04:41.533 --> 04:45.880
To my mind, I try to pay my expenses and buy a few books for myself.

04:46.096 --> 04:47.698
That's the summit of my ambition.

04:47.718 --> 04:50.141
I'm not trying to have an enormous, wonderful stock.

04:50.201 --> 04:52.784
But you have a family to support.

04:53.605 --> 04:55.126
Well, yeah.

04:55.206 --> 04:56.568
Yeah, she illustrates books.

04:57.309 --> 04:59.992
We didn't formally... I'm Anne Arnold.

05:00.553 --> 05:04.737
No, you probably... Peter showed you Ranjit Sinji at Serendipity, the children's book.

05:04.757 --> 05:10.024
She illustrated that, but she's also illustrated books for HarperCollins and Fanny at Chez Fun East.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.285
There's a restaurant around the corner.

05:11.746 --> 05:15.630
So she does make some modest amount of money, but again, she's a grossly underpaid...

05:15.965 --> 05:17.932
She spends too much time on her paintings.

05:17.952 --> 05:21.825
If you look at her paintings after she spent two days on it, it's still underpainting.

05:21.845 --> 05:24.253
It looks like much of the finished stuff that sold

05:24.622 --> 05:25.603
by people.

05:25.623 --> 05:27.485
So she's ridiculously uneconomical.

05:27.505 --> 05:36.014
But the great advantage of living in California, which I despise for low-grade intellectual surroundings, the only good thing is the library, and it's going down the drain.

05:36.555 --> 05:39.258
Ever since I got my NUC, I hardly need to go up to the library.

05:39.278 --> 05:41.060
I used to go every day for two or three hours.

05:41.420 --> 05:42.682
Now it's maybe twice a week.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.084
How many libraries is that NUC, by the way?

05:45.104 --> 05:45.505
756.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.727
You have 756 libraries?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.827
I had to rebuild the bookcases to fit them.

05:51.847 --> 05:56.637
That ensured that I did put it in my catalog before I picked it up, and I felt no one wanted to buy it.

05:56.978 --> 06:08.162
I would rebuild the bookcases so that I could never put anything else on it, so I'd never be still subject to a temptation to... It's not only Berkeley that has it, the Graduate Theological Union is still in Five Block Walk, has another set.

06:08.463 --> 06:12.649
So, although now, with Reconstruction, you can't get to the public NUC.

06:12.969 --> 06:15.974
They've closed down the reference room for the last... What's going on up there?

06:16.014 --> 06:17.295
I'm trying to get a handle on this.

06:17.315 --> 06:19.398
The library is completely gone to shift.

06:19.438 --> 06:19.919
Why?

06:20.740 --> 06:24.826
Well, lack of money, lack of... I know Peter Lyman, who I talked to yesterday.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.069
Do you like some of everything?

06:28.171 --> 06:29.372
I don't know.

06:29.392 --> 06:30.254
I won't be shy.

06:30.334 --> 06:33.178
Why do they say lack of money?

06:33.638 --> 06:35.601
Well, they claim lack of money, which is true.

06:35.969 --> 06:41.138
But it's also that this post, I mean, nowadays you catalog with computers and you have people who don't know anything.

06:41.158 --> 06:43.842
There are people like Tony Bliss up there who do still know something.

06:43.862 --> 06:48.791
If you have a rare book blogger, he's, you know, don't quote me, he's totally burnt out, obviously.

06:49.111 --> 06:50.514
I mean, he's just... He won't admit it, though.

06:50.935 --> 06:54.180
I will shut the machine up at this point.

06:54.548 --> 07:01.556
Well, Hallow had a... the esprit de corps that Hallow was capable of creating was really remarkable.

07:01.937 --> 07:12.689
He made... He would say to people as they went off on the... Yes, Jennifer Larson even quotes... Now, Jennifer Larson and I do have a dislike, but she's got John Warren Hallow on her brain, and has a completely uncritical view of the fellow.

07:12.709 --> 07:14.551
She even prints... It's sad, in a way.

07:14.772 --> 07:15.372
It is sad.

07:15.693 --> 07:20.218
She... you know, Hallow with his... Let's admit that he got a stolen book.

07:20.553 --> 07:22.375
Yeah, yeah.

07:22.395 --> 07:38.876
But she closed and says, I think it's in the thing put out by the Gleason in San Francisco, the USF, where she says, yes, when he gave her her first auction commission, she went off, he said to her, never forget who you are and who you represent.

07:39.276 --> 07:43.021
I mean, this is like being somebody sent off to... Like a kamikaze mission.

07:43.041 --> 07:48.788
Yeah, and it's just that she could print this without seeing if she ever stand back and think,

07:48.987 --> 07:51.351
What will another person think when they read this?

07:51.671 --> 07:52.412
And Howell had that.

07:52.452 --> 07:55.877
He was a very polished... You know, he had an excellent bookshop.

07:55.897 --> 07:56.779
He was sort of charismatic.

07:56.799 --> 07:57.760
Yeah, charismatic person.

07:57.800 --> 08:02.888
I mean, between womanizing on the one hand... See, that's the thing with her.

08:03.248 --> 08:16.648
Obviously, there's the librarian in Jennifer, and she... This esprit de corps, they really do believe, and you can still know, you've seen that thing, the consanguineous tree?

08:16.898 --> 08:29.310
that Jennifer Larson and John Clayton did after Howell's death, which shows there's a tree with John Howell at the bottom, then Warren Howell, and everybody who ever worked there, including people who lasted only two days or were fired.

08:31.452 --> 08:34.355
Jeremy is a little more, although some people say unkind things about him.

08:34.395 --> 08:46.247
I've always gotten along with him, and I think there is... I'm actually rather sympathetic to Jeremy Norman, although he's completely the reverse sort of bookseller that I would choose to do.

08:46.345 --> 08:50.611
He does realize that there's another world out there.

08:50.651 --> 08:57.721
There are many people who are so locked into printing in the mind of man, Garrison, Morton, great books, they really don't have a sense of it.

08:57.741 --> 09:00.865
Jeremy does know, he knows how ignorant he is in many ways.

09:00.905 --> 09:11.801
And there is a, you know, he makes occasional arrogant statement in his catalog prefaces, but there is an element to him that isn't present in many other history of science.

09:11.861 --> 09:13.483
History of science is a bad thing.

09:13.885 --> 09:16.088
It does bad things to people, I think.

09:16.108 --> 09:21.256
But at any rate, the consanguinistry, yes, all those people.

09:21.697 --> 09:24.541
If you look at them, some of them are perfectly nice people.

09:24.581 --> 09:25.843
Others are rather insufferable.

09:25.863 --> 09:30.030
They've all still there some slight vestige of what Howell did to them.

09:30.070 --> 09:35.759
The esprit de corps, they believe that other people who didn't go through the Howell training can't collate a book.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.543
I mean, in the back of their mind, there's that feeling about it.

09:38.692 --> 09:43.039
And, well, here's an excellent idea which you can list, which I think is a very characteristic.

09:43.059 --> 09:43.720
I can or can't?

09:43.800 --> 09:44.160
You can.

09:44.221 --> 09:44.601
Oh, you can.

09:44.882 --> 09:46.344
This thing is well worth quoting.

09:46.404 --> 09:51.512
I won't say which Howells staff member it was, but this to me is the quintessence of Howells.

09:52.313 --> 09:52.874
I was there.

09:53.435 --> 09:54.597
I was probably just a student.

09:54.617 --> 09:56.680
This was probably 1971 or something.

09:58.022 --> 09:58.402
You were there.

09:58.422 --> 09:59.023
You worked there.

09:59.104 --> 09:59.704
No, no, no, no, no.

09:59.745 --> 10:03.190
I was in the Howells shop browsing around when a customer came in.

10:03.210 --> 10:05.614
There was always, Howells was very well staffed.

10:05.634 --> 10:06.555
Lots and lots of people.

10:06.957 --> 10:14.688
And one of these people, always very well dressed, and I've been giving a whole air that, you know, this is money here, and, you know, you need that to induce people.

10:14.708 --> 10:17.272
I mean, many a wealthy person, well, my catalogs look just like type.

10:17.312 --> 10:21.177
They are just, they're on a, they're just typewritten things.

10:21.498 --> 10:29.289
So you don't, people who want it actually to look like printing are going to think there's something suspicious or wrong here, or the price is too wrong.

10:29.309 --> 10:31.151
It can't be any good because it's only $75.

10:32.073 --> 10:34.496
Howell had the mark, he was a superb marketer.

10:34.516 --> 10:35.918
I mean, everything, as what,

10:36.303 --> 10:42.450
Book-selling, not the sort of book-selling I-esteem, but book-selling within the AVAA mode.

10:42.690 --> 10:45.213
Howell's a master practitioner.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.696
And anyway, he taught these people quite well.

10:47.896 --> 10:48.737
So somebody comes in.

10:49.078 --> 10:50.039
You know, tourists would come in.

10:50.219 --> 10:51.881
It was right next to Union Square.

10:52.602 --> 11:05.837
And they do have an ability, which I would be unwilling to have, of being quite nice to total yokels and hicks and people who don't know anything but who may have money, you know, piles of Oklahoma oil money, but can hardly or mispronounce things.

11:06.121 --> 11:10.127
This person came in and asked, do you have any Bibles?

11:11.650 --> 11:13.092
And, well, of course they have Bibles.

11:13.132 --> 11:13.933
Bibles are very collectible.

11:13.953 --> 11:19.823
In fact, John Howell, Warren Howell's father, gave, had a big Bible collection which he gave to the theological union.

11:19.843 --> 11:23.168
They were very, they're devout something or others, I think, Episcopalians.

11:23.869 --> 11:26.874
And this person asked, do you have any Bibles?

11:26.894 --> 11:31.521
And the employee took him over and showed him, they had a,

11:32.210 --> 11:36.174
original edition of Erasmus' Greek New Testament, which is a monument.

11:36.734 --> 11:38.215
I think it is imprinting in the mind of men.

11:38.295 --> 11:38.796
It ought to be.

11:39.536 --> 11:43.740
And the person looked at it.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.944
And you know, many a collector who couldn't read the Greek would buy this.

11:48.164 --> 11:53.469
Norman Strauss, for instance, would have bought something like this, even though he can't read any foreign language.

11:54.570 --> 11:59.414
Does that offend you, by the way, if somebody buys a book that they can't read?

11:59.514 --> 12:00.495
No, no.

12:00.627 --> 12:04.931
But people who, no, it's only when they become a poser.

12:05.372 --> 12:06.573
You know, I have books in languages.

12:06.653 --> 12:13.560
I have a book on Neolatin versifiers in Czechoslovakia, a Czech book.

12:13.580 --> 12:17.944
Barney Rosenthal has this also, and he said, you know, I see you've got the only other copy in California.

12:18.545 --> 12:21.028
I keep telling myself I shouldn't have books in languages I can't read.

12:21.048 --> 12:22.649
And Barney reads more languages than I do.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.153
But it's, of course, it's just a reference book.

12:26.173 --> 12:29.436
I would not have a book of Czech literature on my shelves.

12:29.770 --> 12:33.574
However, this is Neo-Latin poetry, and you've got the titles in Latin.

12:33.814 --> 12:40.700
You've got the account, and it's a schematic thing where you can figure out and check what they're... You know, I have a Danish biograph.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.121
Let me share.

12:41.161 --> 12:45.725
You can sort of take the Danish as being German, and you can figure out birth and death dates.

12:45.745 --> 12:48.408
And many a bookseller uses things like the Biographie Universelle.

12:48.428 --> 12:56.155
I mean, the biggest universal biographies are both in French, and even if you don't know French, you do have to use them, but you can use them because they're very schematic.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.338
So I don't... It's just these people who try to promote...

12:59.656 --> 13:23.467
I guess I would say this applies to Einstein off-prints, where they have a totally artificially inflated value to my mind, which is, and a lot of people don't read the German, very few people do read German, particularly among science book collectors, or there's things, the thing on non-Euclidean mathematics, things published on Gary, all of these Central European things.

13:23.488 --> 13:26.091
You can take it for granted that a person probably knows French.

13:26.411 --> 13:28.414
In the old days, it was the polite accomplishment of

13:28.715 --> 13:35.225
Beyond that, what's the point of somebody having a three-page thing?

13:35.245 --> 13:45.059
It doesn't so much offend me with the Einstein because it's been reprinted and collected papers, but there are things that are out there in the hands of ignorant collectors that could be in the hands of someone who can actually use it.

13:45.099 --> 13:55.515
And I guess I feel that if you learn some obscure language, you might perhaps have the concomitant benefit of spending five years that the books in that language will be cheap.

13:55.647 --> 14:00.653
And you can have, therefore, a very good collection of Czechoslovakian literature because you can buy it.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.277
Well, in this country, Swedish literature would be an excellent example.

14:03.517 --> 14:04.438
There are a lot of emigrants.

14:04.478 --> 14:07.362
There are Swedish books, particularly in Minnesota, are fairly common.

14:07.622 --> 14:09.124
The next generation doesn't know it.

14:09.404 --> 14:12.308
If you still know Swedish, you can buy Swedish books through almost nothing.

14:12.568 --> 14:17.314
And it seems to me that's a sensible area of collecting if you happen to learn such things.

14:17.655 --> 14:21.840
What I object to is in the—this is very common in history of science—the

14:22.360 --> 14:29.355
notion that intellectual value is somehow measurable in financial terms.

14:29.375 --> 14:34.988
And this is totally different from English literature, which used to be the great collecting.

14:35.048 --> 14:39.357
I mean, the days of the early collectors and the early chapters of your things on from

14:39.522 --> 14:41.044
you know, dipped into Huntington.

14:41.305 --> 14:43.088
It's all monuments of English literature.

14:43.108 --> 14:46.333
It's famous things that Huntington may well have read a little Shakespeare.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.715
He may well have read a little Tennessee.

14:47.735 --> 14:48.857
I don't think he read any of it.

14:48.877 --> 14:49.418
Well, but he might.

14:49.438 --> 14:52.724
He probably knew a line or two of quotation from Shakespeare.

14:53.044 --> 15:03.461
At any rate, it wasn't inconceivable that he could have read Shakespeare, so you don't spot him immediately as a poser because he's got something on non-Euclidean geometry in Czech on his shelves.

15:03.922 --> 15:04.703
So, um...

15:06.320 --> 15:11.308
I just think it's bad for humans to attempt to pretend to more learning than they have.

15:11.649 --> 15:18.059
And the ABA, the whole code of book collecting, has forced people into this mode.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.243
I collect Nabokov, so I have to have his early things.

15:20.283 --> 15:25.071
Of course you have to have the early things, but of course no one reads Russian who collects Nabokov largely.

15:25.253 --> 15:27.135
and you're forced into this false position.

15:27.155 --> 15:29.557
I always think that's bad for people, because it's like Haven O'More.

15:29.577 --> 15:30.338
It leads them to lie.

15:30.518 --> 15:31.579
Look at the Haven O'More thing.

15:31.599 --> 15:35.482
He was selling these books, and yet the entire globe at the back... A little tip.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.003
A little tip.

15:38.044 --> 15:38.265
What to do.

15:38.285 --> 15:38.625
What to do.

15:38.645 --> 15:40.347
Well, you know, we can talk later.

15:40.647 --> 15:42.248
He's not going to be here for all that long.

15:42.729 --> 15:45.931
And you can give me advice, and then I can tell other people about it.

15:45.952 --> 15:51.516
Haven O'More, the whole thing about how, you know, this is the library for the heavenly city, and yet it's being sold.

15:51.537 --> 15:53.218
This contradiction is never addressed.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.134
But it's this great poser.

15:56.075 --> 15:56.956
Anyway.

15:57.176 --> 15:58.297
Get back to the Bible.

15:58.317 --> 15:59.398
Get back to the Bible, exactly.

16:00.059 --> 16:00.880
There's the Greek Bible.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.842
So he's got this in this Erasmus New Testament.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.106
And the fellow looks at it.

16:06.186 --> 16:07.327
And, well, he doesn't read Greek.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.489
And he wants something the folks back home can, you know.

16:09.509 --> 16:12.913
So he says, don't you have anything in English?

16:12.933 --> 16:16.697
Well, he obviously might well have bought a first edition of the King's James Bible.

16:16.717 --> 16:18.639
A perfectly worthy, antiquarian thing.

16:18.679 --> 16:20.822
Wouldn't have disgraced the shelves of Powell's.

16:21.783 --> 16:23.104
They didn't happen to have one at the time.

16:23.303 --> 16:29.671
They finished showing him what they had in Greek, and when he said, don't you have anything in English, the fellow drew himself up.

16:29.691 --> 16:41.366
He drew himself up in this typical Howell fashion and said, at Howells, they always identified himself at Howells, at Howells, we don't deal much in translations.

16:42.767 --> 16:50.357
And I felt, you know, of all things to say, if he'd asked for Nabokov first editions, and they didn't have the Russians, they only offered them the Russians to ask them, I do.

16:50.557 --> 16:56.062
But the King James Bible, and the King James Bible has had more influence on English civilization than the Greek Testament ever has.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.365
The only work of art ever produced by a committee, I think.

17:00.586 --> 17:14.077
So it was the mot injuste for absolutely, if you couldn't have picked a wronger book to say it up, that to me summarizes the ethos that Hallow instilled in his people, which I, of course, as I've said, despise.

17:14.517 --> 17:17.480
How do you respond to somebody like Herbert Tentured?

17:18.961 --> 17:19.542
Is that Tentured?

17:19.562 --> 17:19.922
Tentured?

17:20.358 --> 17:23.863
I hardly do or know anything about manuscripts.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.691
They're very fancy catalogs.

17:30.753 --> 17:31.374
I really don't know.

17:33.937 --> 17:35.860
I certainly will in my Parnassi Reticule.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.184
Well, I think I may even have a rhyme somewhere else.

17:38.404 --> 17:39.646
People like the Sourges.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.670
I do despise the Sourges.

17:42.835 --> 17:44.818
But, of course, everyone despises his associates.

17:44.838 --> 17:58.555
They're even below booksellers because they know even they're more, obviously, money-grubbing than... Most booksellers try to pretend that, although they're not advertising them as investments necessarily, at least in print, they try to pretend that we love the book.

17:58.575 --> 17:59.457
And I think they really do.

17:59.857 --> 18:02.020
Even Chernofsky, he loves the book.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.161
He's a total idiot.

18:03.181 --> 18:04.183
But he does like the book.

18:04.203 --> 18:07.527
And it's personally possible he could be writing an in-house magazine for...

18:08.553 --> 18:10.256
Edmond Scientific Company.

18:10.616 --> 18:11.277
I was talking about the Sourges.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.199
Sourges, yes, the Sourges.

18:12.219 --> 18:12.980
Patrick and Elisabeth Sourges.

18:13.000 --> 18:25.701
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

18:26.288 --> 18:34.601
No, he's once said to somebody, you know it, Papa, that stupid person, we're going to damn him to hell.

18:35.162 --> 18:36.745
We're going to write a Claire Hugh about it.

18:37.706 --> 18:41.512
He actually wrote a Claire Hugh about Rob Rulon Miller, which is this.

18:41.572 --> 18:42.935
This was about a year and a half ago.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.697
He was tired of hearing my Claire Hughes.

18:45.398 --> 18:48.503
He said, Rob Rulon Miller is getting stiller and stiller.

18:48.824 --> 18:52.650
Sooner or later, he was eaten by an alligator, which has the lack of

18:52.985 --> 18:56.371
Rob's the only person who's been done twice by my clarities.

18:56.391 --> 18:58.915
I should also point out, I won't name the names of the school.

18:58.935 --> 19:03.522
Now, why is Rob... I've never met him, by the way.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.744
I think Rob's a perfectly fine person.

19:05.105 --> 19:06.567
And actually, they aren't offensive.

19:07.288 --> 19:10.313
No, neither of them are offensive to Rob.

19:10.594 --> 19:14.220
Actually, in spite of my opinions I've given you now are fairly unbuttoned.

19:14.240 --> 19:19.228
I wouldn't dream of... You know, to write them out indicates a degree of...

19:20.052 --> 19:26.060
You know, if these things were said by almost anyone else in the book trade, there would be an agenda behind them.

19:26.080 --> 19:31.328
To me, although I am a bookseller, I don't buy from these people.

19:31.348 --> 19:33.230
I'm a disinterested observer.

19:33.951 --> 19:39.999
I know most of these people, but I don't make deals with them.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.765
I'm a distant observer.

19:43.785 --> 19:46.228
So there's no axe to grind here.

19:48.436 --> 19:54.866
You know, I simply look at a person as what they pretend to be, what they put out officially in print, their catalogs, for instance.

19:54.886 --> 19:59.954
And I see, I mean, Nicholas Markin does the same thing in his funny catalogs every couple of years.

19:59.974 --> 20:05.182
I mean, there are these people who make ridiculous mistakes, and they're pillory, I think, in a perfectly gentle way.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.804
I mean, not everyone knows everything.

20:06.824 --> 20:09.308
Some people are more willfully ignorant than others.

20:09.608 --> 20:13.154
That's another objection I have to many a bookseller.

20:13.554 --> 20:15.237
It's not merely...

20:16.128 --> 20:46.033
ignorance because everyone can't know everything it's willful ignorance because you will note I buy most of my books from other booksellers that's the cheapest way to get them I get a few things privately but I always pay too much if I buy privately it's much cheaper to buy it from a bookseller and that's also a clean transaction if you actually know a book is worth X number of dollars you're obliged to pay a certain percentage of X to the person whereas if a bookseller has already priced it you buy it at that minus 10 or 20 percent and there's no you haven't cheated anyone

20:47.026 --> 20:54.898
But there are, and this is fairly, again, I won't name names, there are booksellers who I think are deliberately ignorant.

20:54.918 --> 20:57.582
What they do is they buy the book and they can shrug their shoulders.

20:58.383 --> 21:04.313
You know, you know that in their heart of hearts they have a bit of a notion that this book printed in such and such a year and such and such a place.

21:04.853 --> 21:10.061
It sends signals to them, possibly even finger spits into you, that it might be worth something.

21:10.141 --> 21:10.502
But

21:10.718 --> 21:11.980
I don't know.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.106
So they'll buy it for, let us say, $25.

21:16.388 --> 21:19.093
They don't want to pay too much for it, so I'll buy a safe sum.

21:19.113 --> 21:20.555
It's always incredibly small, $25.

21:20.976 --> 21:22.338
They then go home.

21:22.358 --> 21:26.185
It wouldn't be fair to the customer if I didn't put a fair price on it.

21:26.626 --> 21:29.191
And so they go and look it up heavily and discover it's worth $1,000.

21:29.331 --> 21:34.600
And, of course, they don't go back to the... In the honest thing, if you're completely ignorant...

21:34.968 --> 21:39.533
and you're buying a single book, which seems to be of some value, is to say, well, I looked this up.

21:39.553 --> 21:40.815
It could be worth $50.

21:40.855 --> 21:42.056
It could be worth $3,000.

21:43.958 --> 21:45.239
Give me a day or two, and I'll find out.

21:45.620 --> 21:53.228
But there are a number of booksellers, and I'm not saying that it is when you've got a huge library, this possibly isn't practical, or they've brought them over the counter, and they've got to leave right then.

21:53.569 --> 21:53.989
I'm not saying.

21:54.009 --> 22:02.399
But there are certainly people who seem to know an enormous amount about their book after it's been priced, and they know absolutely nothing beforehand.

22:02.819 --> 22:03.760
There's a bookseller...

22:04.060 --> 22:06.863
Well, some local men.

22:06.883 --> 22:07.885
There are some local men.

22:07.905 --> 22:10.207
No, I think it's a fairly common phenomenon.

22:10.568 --> 22:16.075
I think the person honestly ought to say, well, a place like Moe's.

22:16.375 --> 22:23.604
I think they know a good bit about certain sorts of books and not a lot about others, but they buy at a certain rate and sell at a certain rate.

22:23.864 --> 22:24.164
Moe's.

22:24.224 --> 22:28.870
It's just a typical second-hand bookstore, a very well-run second-hand bookstore.

22:30.976 --> 22:36.242
They are the sort of people who regularly buy books for $10 and discover that they're worth $1,000.

22:36.902 --> 22:41.708
They regularly buy books for $500 and sell it for $1,000, or buy it for $10 and sell it for $20.

22:42.468 --> 22:46.873
They tend to know about as much as they knew about the book.

22:47.334 --> 22:50.237
You bring it in, and they look it up in a few... They don't have a huge reference library.

22:50.257 --> 22:51.298
They look up in a few places.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.940
They see what seems to be a fair price.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.442
They pay you half of that, and they put it out on the shelves at that.

22:55.462 --> 22:56.123
They've never...

22:56.305 --> 23:00.569
You know, it hasn't gone back in the back room and six months later after it's been fully researched, it appears.

23:00.849 --> 23:03.151
That to me, now they may be selling the book for too little.

23:03.551 --> 23:05.173
Of course, they may be sometimes paying too much.

23:05.513 --> 23:07.835
But that seems to me it's an honest way of doing business.

23:07.855 --> 23:08.936
One can't know everything.

23:08.956 --> 23:16.522
So when I trash these people for being stupid, which many booksellers are, you know, I recognize it's a business and you cannot know everything.

23:16.542 --> 23:25.570
And I think Moe's represents a level of scrupulousness, honesty, learning within the sort of general second-hand thing, which is...

23:26.022 --> 23:31.108
admirable and could be imitated by many others.

23:31.248 --> 23:39.437
But, you know, it's a big firm where there must be 15 employees, maybe even 20, and you've got to have some sort of corporate ethos.

23:39.517 --> 23:40.518
This is the way we do it.

23:40.538 --> 23:44.182
So you get these people who, you know, you pay $10 for a $20 book.

23:44.222 --> 23:44.823
Just do it.

23:45.443 --> 23:53.532
And the downside is you have some slightly mindless people occasionally, and there are certain sort of books which they ought to buy and they don't because they're

23:53.984 --> 23:56.227
They have their little sort of books that they sell.

23:56.247 --> 24:01.973
I mean, they're aiming at what, to my mind, is a slightly stupid customer, sort of typical 18-year-old undergraduate.

24:02.254 --> 24:03.835
It's not as though they won't have an intelligence.

24:03.996 --> 24:07.059
But you look at the difference between that and Black Oat, which I despise.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.701
Well, I shouldn't say that.

24:08.961 --> 24:11.184
He's a much greedier person.

24:11.564 --> 24:12.585
But he has better books.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.889
But, of course, the reason he has better books is because they're all protectively priced.

24:16.290 --> 24:21.936
Mose never has quite as good books as he does because they're always being sold.

24:21.976 --> 24:23.518
A good book arrives there in three months.

24:23.617 --> 24:28.242
What's that?

24:28.402 --> 24:29.343
Mose, huh?

24:29.423 --> 24:29.723
M-O-E-S.

24:29.804 --> 24:31.305
Mose himself was like Chernofsky.

24:31.325 --> 24:32.967
He knew something about paperbacks, and that was about it.

24:33.327 --> 24:35.790
But he had employees who knew more than he did.

24:36.350 --> 24:43.518
And I'm not saying it's the pearl of bookshops, but as a way of a corporate ethos, we do it this way.

24:44.019 --> 24:45.760
They have money behind them.

24:46.001 --> 24:46.962
They have a big shop.

24:47.222 --> 24:51.126
They realize that if you can have a fast turnover, see, they give trade to people.

24:51.342 --> 24:54.645
And if you've got trade in a place and there are never any new books, who wants to have trade?

24:55.126 --> 24:59.370
If you have trade and there are always new books, you think, well, I'll trade my books in and I'll be able to find something wonderful.

24:59.410 --> 25:02.173
If I don't find it now, I'll go back in a week and the stock will be different.

25:02.413 --> 25:05.436
So they have trucks that people, book trucks, they have to shelve anything.

25:05.456 --> 25:05.977
Where are they?

25:06.157 --> 25:07.458
And they're right out on Telegraph.

25:08.539 --> 25:13.645
So they, you know, of course, if you have trade, you don't invest capital in these books.

25:14.726 --> 25:16.067
And so...

25:16.385 --> 25:17.586
It's a very sensible way.

25:17.606 --> 25:21.611
And you can play with the IRS too, which is interesting.

25:21.631 --> 25:24.415
Well, I'm not sure how much they're able to do it nowadays.

25:24.475 --> 25:29.741
But yes, obviously there are no codes as to what they paid for it in the book.

25:29.761 --> 25:33.826
They must have a set value of the stock, which is probably fair.

25:33.846 --> 25:35.228
They've always got books on their shelves.

25:35.809 --> 25:40.294
I'm not writing about that in any way.

25:40.434 --> 25:41.516
So it's interesting.

25:41.576 --> 25:44.299
You largely buy from booksellers and you sell

25:44.650 --> 25:46.872
in great measure to booksellers.

25:46.892 --> 25:48.194
That's right.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.336
90% of my books are bought from booksellers.

25:50.497 --> 25:51.898
Is that a paradox in any way?

25:52.198 --> 25:52.419
No.

25:52.699 --> 25:54.000
Booksellers are your best customers.

25:54.681 --> 26:08.176
Yeah, but you're recognizing something in a book that another bookseller hasn't recognized, certainly enough to justify your purchasing it and being able to sell it for a profit to another bookseller.

26:08.196 --> 26:10.759
A lot of people could not imitate my style of doing it.

26:10.879 --> 26:14.303
Obviously, leaving intellect aside,

26:15.481 --> 26:18.405
How can you leave intellect?

26:18.425 --> 26:23.872
No, but I'm just saying there's a program for if I wrote a book as to how to sell, how you can sell books.

26:25.053 --> 26:27.717
I don't necessarily, you know, you have to then leave.

26:27.737 --> 26:29.819
Well, at Moe's they leave intellect largely.

26:29.999 --> 26:30.981
Well, that's Moe's.

26:31.001 --> 26:36.728
That's Moe's and this is... Yeah, well, I understand, but I'm trying not to... Obviously, I have no disciples.

26:36.788 --> 26:38.370
No one else sells books in this way.

26:38.751 --> 26:42.315
You need to ally it to a certain manner of living, which I was...

26:42.886 --> 26:46.060
explaining when you asked how my wife and family to support.

26:46.421 --> 26:48.149
I don't make very much money.

26:48.671 --> 26:51.242
But living here...

26:52.927 --> 26:54.129
It's a good source of supply.

26:54.149 --> 27:01.699
Berkeley has a huge number of books, although people on the East Coast would think, in California, there's hardly anything, because they're thinking about a few overpriced booksellers with a few.

27:01.899 --> 27:03.882
And there isn't a huge number of 19th century books.

27:03.982 --> 27:07.146
The perception of the East Coast might say, 18th century.

27:07.266 --> 27:10.250
How could there possibly be any 18th century stuff?

27:10.270 --> 27:18.741
But if you compare the bookshops, the books post-1950, because there's at least some intellectual life in Berkeley, it's vast.

27:18.761 --> 27:19.963
So you look at Harvard or Yale.

27:20.298 --> 27:22.140
Look at the bookshops right around Harvard or Yale.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.684
They're pitiful, pitiful compared to here.

27:24.704 --> 27:26.746
There's nothing in Harvard Square that excites me.

27:26.766 --> 27:27.548
Yeah, there's absolutely nothing.

27:27.848 --> 27:30.451
Where is this one?

27:30.612 --> 27:32.454
Oh, right.

27:32.474 --> 27:33.435
You need one of those.

27:33.916 --> 27:38.462
You can only stay for two hours without being.

27:38.502 --> 27:40.024
We have little slips for guests.

27:41.246 --> 27:42.407
Yale is even worse.

27:42.623 --> 27:45.586
I mean, it's Bill Rees, great books and stuff, but there's no second-hand.

27:45.827 --> 27:54.317
If you look at the number of second-hand bookshops in Berkeley, I mean, Moe's, Peter Howard, I mean, there are easily 750,000 second-hand books.

27:55.298 --> 28:00.944
Well, I shouldn't tell you... But you have to have known Peter for an enormous amount of time.

28:01.485 --> 28:02.626
I buy easily from Peter.

28:02.646 --> 28:04.729
But, of course, I'm not trying to buy modern first editions.

28:04.789 --> 28:12.057
I don't expect him to sell his first edition of Ulysses that he's already paid $50,000 for for $51,000.

28:12.290 --> 28:16.777
Peter is deceptive.

28:18.459 --> 28:20.642
I think Peter is quite remarkable, too.

28:20.863 --> 28:22.545
He's built an enormous amount of booksellers.

28:22.585 --> 28:24.128
You have to remember that stuff on the floor.

28:24.188 --> 28:25.550
It's spectacular.

28:25.830 --> 28:33.702
I feel like I've been in there, but I have never physically been in there before this morning.

28:33.722 --> 28:35.464
We've talked dozens of times.

28:37.007 --> 28:39.410
This is my fourth trip to Berkeley this week.

28:39.470 --> 28:39.951
I'm here.

28:40.690 --> 28:47.143
about living here is that food is amazingly cheap, even if you don't get wine cheaply from your neighbors.

28:47.844 --> 28:54.177
You know, we're within the farmer's markets, and we're within 20 miles of things that have just been picked this morning.

28:54.494 --> 28:58.679
It's hardly been crated in, and food is incredibly cheap, and the quality.

28:58.699 --> 29:06.008
I mean, the East Coast is just, you know, especially in the winter, I mean, you've got these horrible things, and the rest of Europe, all of England, is just full of... Yeah, food costs almost nothing.

29:06.028 --> 29:10.613
I only eat tomatoes in the summertime, and we can get them fresh from our local farmers.

29:11.013 --> 29:19.483
And, you know, if you are married to a fairly good cook and have cheap ingredients, you can live on almost nothing, and I don't, you know, we don't travel very much.

29:20.084 --> 29:22.527
A lot of these expenses, you know, by the way, no computer...

29:22.642 --> 29:24.965
no television set, we don't go out a great deal.

29:25.206 --> 29:26.908
There are all these no fancy clothes.

29:27.369 --> 29:31.235
There are a lot of these expenses that Americans seem to think are absolutely essential to life.

29:31.655 --> 29:34.439
And that count for, you know, $10,000, $15,000 a year.

29:34.740 --> 29:42.391
You can actually, also if you're a bookseller and your chief interest is books, everything you do is tax deductible.

29:42.411 --> 29:44.594
You know, I subscribe to all the bibliographies on the site.

29:44.634 --> 29:49.101
Well, of course, you know, if anyone ever questioned it, I'd say, well, you know, just here's a sheet with my catalogs.

29:49.121 --> 29:49.982
Look at what I quote.

29:50.333 --> 30:09.601
I thought it's like a far better case to make for using my reference library than almost any bookseller, because I actually footnote things which, well... Every single book I buy, every newspaper I buy, every magazine I buy, is fully, I deduct 100%.

30:09.942 --> 30:18.855
I don't care if it's, you know, The New Yorker or any subscription that my wife subscribes to, or even...

30:19.392 --> 30:20.694
pay with my business check.

30:20.714 --> 30:22.577
Yeah, well, it's perfectly legitimate.

30:22.677 --> 30:27.244
Tell me it's not, you know, anything that gives me an idea or anything that gives me a footnote.

30:27.264 --> 30:30.128
You mentioned this guy, the 20,000 books.

30:30.649 --> 30:32.972
Before I forget, you know, I didn't know that reference there.

30:33.213 --> 30:34.134
Oh, Mark Patterson.

30:34.234 --> 30:36.137
Yeah, that's new to me, and I've heard that.

30:36.217 --> 30:37.119
He said that's famous.

30:37.539 --> 30:38.340
Not a famous, Mark.

30:38.861 --> 30:45.672
I'm sure it's probably in, if you look up in the index to, like, Holbrook, Jackson's, and Naomi's Bibliomania, I'm sure.

30:45.692 --> 30:48.015
I'm going to have a chapter on reading in here.

30:48.704 --> 30:56.653
which is why Tilly was remarkable the other night, because this is a woman who had never finished high school, and it's totally a product of her reading.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.856
I did an interview with Maurice Sendak a couple of weeks ago.

30:59.876 --> 31:03.500
I love Maurice Sendak.

31:03.520 --> 31:09.046
Totally a product of the books that he's read, and Stephen Jay Gould, who I've interviewed.

31:09.066 --> 31:13.250
You know, I mean, it's kind of got a variety of voices.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.533
See, those are instances of what I was saying.

31:15.553 --> 31:18.576
You know, they've learned to read, and they have some curiosity.

31:18.944 --> 31:26.592
And anyone whose opinions are worth hearing or can think can proceed from that.

31:26.693 --> 31:32.379
We always want these institutional fixes for things and trying to homogenize everything.

31:32.679 --> 31:35.843
We can create a standard product out of the American high school.

31:36.784 --> 31:44.833
And we've gone in this direction of multiculturalism, which is just, again, it's sort of lowest common denominator, God-given.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.334
In other words, you don't have to do anything.

31:46.354 --> 31:48.917
You are Armenian culture.

31:49.673 --> 31:58.988
It seems to me that if we simply, you know, we'll recognize genuine diversity in people, like some people are a lot more intelligent than others, or some people have some interests that others don't have.

31:59.269 --> 32:06.360
And I think my own, when I was saying I would leave intellect out of it, I do think certainly to have an opinion in intellect is useful.

32:06.681 --> 32:15.816
It is perfectly possible, though, to sell books with a degree of cunning, which most businessmen do have, and a decent memory, which of course you have to have,

32:15.998 --> 32:18.382
and having put a fair amount into your brain.

32:18.422 --> 32:21.728
And I tend, well, there's another quotation you could perhaps remember.

32:22.108 --> 32:25.494
It's said of, well, you should have to look this book up.

32:25.514 --> 32:26.055
It's by R.W.

32:26.275 --> 32:26.736
Chapman.

32:26.796 --> 32:32.726
Chapman is the editor of Jane Austen's letters and of the editor of the earlier edition of Samuel Johnson's letters.

32:32.746 --> 32:36.032
He worked for Oxford University Press, Cardinal Press for years.

32:36.052 --> 32:37.534
He died about 1960.

32:38.088 --> 32:39.690
and wrote books himself.

32:39.710 --> 32:46.460
He wrote a volume called, I think it's like Essays in Macedonia, or it's his first book, about 1919.

32:46.500 --> 33:01.260
It collects in it an essay he wrote called Portrait of a Scholar, which also appears, that's the easiest way to find it, otherwise it's an account of Ingram Bywell.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.877
More information than I need.

33:02.897 --> 33:03.759
I have the book in here.

33:04.940 --> 33:10.128
Bywater was the Bywater and Sotheby professorship of Greek at Oxford.

33:11.030 --> 33:15.596
Bywater was a very learned scholar and a great book collector.

33:15.616 --> 33:18.000
His wife had money, and would buy books as presents for him.

33:18.461 --> 33:22.347
But he also had, and no children.

33:24.269 --> 33:29.357
Anyway, Chapman, this portrait of scholars, beautifully written, deftly sketched,

33:29.641 --> 33:31.503
It's my notion of the game.

33:31.523 --> 33:32.865
Patterson, of course, had some problems.

33:32.885 --> 33:35.688
The personality of the game was a very learned man with a brain.

33:36.269 --> 33:41.114
See, you do have to distinguish intellect and learning, which people often don't bother to do.

33:41.415 --> 33:45.780
There are many, I can name a few, booksellers who are very learned and really have no intellect at all.

33:46.220 --> 33:56.172
You would find these inspired idiots, some of these Welsh, you know, Roberts, who was the great linguist around 1820, knew, you know, 75 language, but couldn't say anything in any of them.

33:56.489 --> 33:59.833
It was a complete, you know, idiot savant sort of linguist.

34:00.474 --> 34:03.297
Bywater and Patterson are both very learned men.

34:03.858 --> 34:10.867
And this is a portrait where, you see, Chapman also collected books, usually rather dog-eared copies.

34:10.887 --> 34:16.534
It's a catalog of his library just published as Library of a Scholar, probably echoing this thing.

34:16.574 --> 34:21.300
Percy Muir, Elkin Matthews, about 1945, is a lot of 18th century books.

34:21.380 --> 34:24.724
It's Chapman's libraries or turnouts.

34:25.261 --> 34:30.689
It's a wonderfully sketched account of not only a scholar's life, but the position that books fill in that.

34:30.729 --> 34:32.651
What's the title, Library of a Scholar?

34:33.713 --> 34:34.814
It's Portrait of a Scholar.

34:34.834 --> 34:36.557
Okay, you just said Library of a Scholar.

34:36.577 --> 34:37.678
Yeah, Portrait of a Scholar, I'm sorry.

34:37.738 --> 34:41.283
It's this thing, it's in this Essays in Macedonia, I think.

34:41.303 --> 34:44.267
If we remember, I can show it to you before you read.

34:45.309 --> 34:53.080
But it has some, because Chapman himself was a scholar and used antiquarian books, had some notion of how books could be used in a learned context.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.762
And I'm always very interested in

34:55.214 --> 34:56.676
scholarly methodology.

34:57.317 --> 34:59.441
And I have a little hole down there that you came down.

34:59.461 --> 35:01.844
It's nothing but biographies of scholars and naturalists.

35:02.425 --> 35:05.190
And there must be at least 2,000 of them.

35:05.891 --> 35:07.573
And you've read them all, I'm sure.

35:08.515 --> 35:08.955
No.

35:09.496 --> 35:12.521
I do think most books, there are books to read through.

35:12.581 --> 35:16.708
There are books which you spent half an hour dipping into.

35:16.748 --> 35:17.649
You check the index.

35:17.689 --> 35:19.011
You check the table of contents.

35:19.071 --> 35:22.757
You sample through it so that you've got a grasp of what's in there.

35:23.041 --> 35:25.303
And you can then... And how it can help you when you need it.

35:25.323 --> 35:25.984
How it can help you later.

35:26.004 --> 35:28.206
And I think, you know, obviously I have 30,000 books.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.729
And the fact is, of course, many of the books I read aren't the books I own.

35:30.749 --> 35:31.890
They're books I borrow from the library.

35:31.990 --> 35:34.352
Well, no, the 30,000 books, this is not stock for sale.

35:34.372 --> 35:35.513
This is your personal library.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.055
No, I have 6,000 for sale in the attic.

35:37.075 --> 35:37.215
Okay.

35:37.235 --> 35:38.917
I haven't taken any of the attic.

35:39.117 --> 35:41.459
And I have maybe, it's probably only 25,000, 28,000.

35:41.579 --> 35:45.563
Well, that's... It's a substantial number.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.146
But, you know, with reference... 50,000 of yours, then.

35:48.166 --> 35:48.967
Yeah.

35:48.987 --> 35:50.348
But with reference books, of course,

35:50.463 --> 35:52.525
I mean, there are many a reference book with D&B.

35:52.565 --> 35:53.747
I haven't read the whole D&B.

35:53.787 --> 35:54.467
You know what's in it.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.368
You use it when you have it.

35:55.649 --> 36:02.036
And you need, well, Calderon, what I was saying was the book collector who said, you know, it's unwise to have a wife and family if you want to collect books.

36:02.416 --> 36:09.564
He points out there was a, he wrote, he's a very outspoken scholar who publishes in English but largely abroad.

36:09.584 --> 36:17.833
And with this modern technology where you provide camera-ready copy to some German publisher, he never edits it.

36:17.873 --> 36:19.795
So Calderon's wonderful account, I think,

36:20.247 --> 36:21.929
of life.

36:21.949 --> 36:28.897
He was a grad student at Harvard in classics in the 1950s, of sort of internecine warfare in the Harvard Classics Department in the 50s.

36:28.917 --> 36:31.460
It was printed in some sort of best script.

36:32.221 --> 36:37.267
You print quaderni di studi classici in Bologna or something.

36:37.287 --> 36:39.650
You know, Calder's Friends, I got an off-print of something.

36:39.670 --> 36:41.432
Calder's Friends will get a free off-print from him.

36:41.753 --> 36:44.936
A few classicists to read Italian classical journals will see it.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.238
Otherwise, this sort of

36:46.589 --> 36:50.455
time bomb, anti-Harvard time bomb, will be completely unknown to anyone.

36:51.117 --> 36:52.198
Do you mind if I take your picture?

36:53.160 --> 36:54.282
Certainly.

36:54.763 --> 36:55.704
Go ahead, just keep talking.

36:56.526 --> 36:58.870
I just don't want any surprises.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.654
No, no, I think, are you in, should I be in the line?

37:01.674 --> 37:02.396
No, I like it.

37:02.676 --> 37:04.199
Just keep talking.

37:04.399 --> 37:12.833
Anyway, Calder points out that if you have Polyvosova, which is the

37:13.522 --> 37:20.049
German classical dictionary of classical antiquities in about 100 volumes.

37:20.429 --> 37:24.214
It's very expensive to have it because it costs $10,000.

37:24.454 --> 37:27.878
He claims that if you own it, you are more likely to cite it, which is perfectly true.

37:28.538 --> 37:29.760
And that's the same with the NUC.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.563
I've got it right here, so I've got no excuse to just walk in.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.605
It's easier to use than microfiche or anything.

37:34.645 --> 37:35.706
It's quicker than online.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.449
So...

37:41.247 --> 37:42.468
I know this is a distraction.

37:42.488 --> 37:43.069
No, it's all right.

37:43.369 --> 37:51.917
So I think books are very useful to have one's own copies of reference books on the shelf, but you again don't need to have actually looked at it.

37:51.937 --> 38:02.666
Anyway, what I was about to say about... You really have five times as many books of your own than you have for sale, which I've never heard of such a... Well, you know, Barney Rosenthal and I buy as to quantity.

38:03.006 --> 38:10.393
Barney has, I would say, about 8,000 reference books and maybe 400 books for sale.

38:10.930 --> 38:13.694
Of course, they're all incunables or manuscripts.

38:13.714 --> 38:16.438
So his stock is much more valuable than my 6,000.

38:16.679 --> 38:18.581
But I would say his proportion is even more extreme.

38:18.602 --> 38:22.888
In fact, he often says the stock exists to support the reference library.

38:23.008 --> 38:25.352
It is true not a lot of people have as many reference books as mine.

38:25.412 --> 38:26.754
Do you subscribe to that for yourself?

38:27.555 --> 38:27.936
Of course.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.321
Well, where do you get your greatest satisfaction daily?

38:31.901 --> 38:33.203
Reading books on my own.

38:33.264 --> 38:35.126
I would quit book selling tomorrow if I could afford it.

38:35.527 --> 38:38.912
And I wouldn't need to have too much extra money to do it.

38:39.331 --> 38:43.717
You know, an income of $20,000 a year out of stocks or something, I would quit tomorrow.

38:44.618 --> 38:46.580
Your income is less than that?

38:47.822 --> 38:48.723
No, it's about that.

38:49.084 --> 38:49.544
$20,000.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.831
But you see, I should point out the number of... I can use that figure, you don't mind.

38:57.394 --> 39:04.123
So he's writing this new problem, and he said to me, finally he's on Chapter 14, he's almost done with the problems, and he...

39:05.167 --> 39:10.553
but he'd spent the previous day and a half of solving one of these problems himself.

39:11.274 --> 39:14.217
You know, you invent the problem, and then you have to give the complete solution showing your work.

39:14.457 --> 39:20.864
And I felt that my father, who's been doing classical electrodynamics for 50 years, takes a day and a half.

39:20.884 --> 39:23.227
I mean, pity the poor graduate student.

39:23.247 --> 39:28.092
And yet this was said without any notion of this might be rather too difficult.

39:28.172 --> 39:34.819
I was going to tell you another tale of a person who's now making a lot of money in computers, but he originally came as a physics graduate student here

39:35.440 --> 39:41.069
And he said, he was rather cocky about himself.

39:41.089 --> 39:46.056
He said he arrived in a first-year physics grad student, head state, my father's course taught by my father here.

39:46.717 --> 39:52.547
He said, I arrived in that class thinking I was Einstein, and I left realizing I was nothing.

39:52.567 --> 39:53.348
And he dropped out.

39:53.768 --> 40:03.844
So there is that, obviously, it's, I think, an astonished, you could say, Scottish Calvinist severity, which, you know, the American way of life is just this,

40:04.415 --> 40:16.271
I mean, when I say Scottish Calvin, I mean, we're Canadian by birth, but Ontario was 90% Scottish emigrants, and it certainly preserves a fair amount of ethnocentric way of judging things.

40:16.491 --> 40:26.084
You come up to America, particularly California, where it's all just sort of anything goes, low standards for everything, and that's also time.

40:26.344 --> 40:31.671
At any rate, University of Illinois is a superb library, and better than Berkeley's.

40:32.393 --> 40:39.243
and far the most largest circulation of anything I've done.

40:42.108 --> 40:43.229
Fifty-few, right?

40:43.289 --> 40:43.630
Fifty-few.

40:43.950 --> 40:45.994
Well, you know, the happy few of Stendhal.

40:46.094 --> 40:47.356
Again, it sounds arrogant to say.

40:47.656 --> 40:50.921
It's not as though I'm meaning to be... The happy few, the happy few, the band of brothers.

40:51.061 --> 40:51.802
That's Shakespeare.

40:52.243 --> 40:57.591
Well, Stendhal, though, I used to dedicate, he was one of the vague...

40:58.381 --> 40:59.823
he used it as an epigraph.

40:59.843 --> 41:07.033
It was one of his slightly fractured English, but Stolendhal was always claiming he was writing for the happy few or for posterity or something.

41:08.195 --> 41:18.970
And anyway, I'm not out to convert anyone who doesn't want to be converted, but it seems, you know, I do admit I also have a tendency in my conversation, unlike some people, to actually give you the citation.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.133
I have a fairly good memory, so I can tell you where I've read it.

41:21.153 --> 41:24.237
I don't just say, you know, he knew nothing that he didn't

41:24.537 --> 41:27.261
that wasn't worth learning and say, well, gee, I sort of heard it somewhere.

41:27.561 --> 41:32.969
Because, of course, I tend to think my interlocutor possibly is as interested in looking up as myself.

41:33.089 --> 41:36.074
I found, I've educated myself largely by looking up footnotes.

41:36.094 --> 41:52.097
You get a book, and you find it, and if it's a decent book, that person has presumably read and assimilated the literature on the subject, and therefore you don't, it's not like the Internet where these giant catalogs, you know, I pity these poor students typing in on the computer trying to find a book on Chicano studies or something,

41:52.415 --> 41:55.159
far better to find the rough call number.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.801
Nicholson Baker will tell you this.

41:56.841 --> 42:02.990
Get the rough call number, get the book, find out what looks to be the most valuable, check the bibliography and footnotes of that.

42:03.010 --> 42:04.171
You've got it selected down.

42:04.211 --> 42:08.157
The dreadful thing with modern computerization of it is you notice this again and again.

42:08.497 --> 42:17.930
People have footnotes that are books they haven't even read because you can download somebody else's database and you get these huge lists of books which may be absolute rubbish.

42:18.211 --> 42:19.432
They may be completely irrelevant.

42:19.452 --> 42:21.375
There are things in the data, I saw the reading of it,

42:21.625 --> 42:36.327
book on the history of academies of art published by some Dutchman and not a subject that's greatly been written on so I try to keep up with all the literature on it and they had through their search of their database they had
