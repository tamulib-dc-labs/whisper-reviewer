00:02.495 --> 00:26.247
And I'm really interested in this new book that I'm working on.

00:26.267 --> 00:27.068
You know, books of the future, don't we?

00:27.088 --> 00:29.091
Books... I spent several days out at Cornell University last week where they're digitizing things.

00:29.111 --> 00:29.872
They're putting on books on computers.

00:29.892 --> 00:31.995
We could talk about it, but they're doing it there to the point that they are some books that they are...

00:32.498 --> 00:39.685
putting it on the computer and then they're destroying the books and sending the books off to the landfill.

00:39.845 --> 00:44.569
And then there's this whole question of the relevance of the book.

00:44.589 --> 00:48.273
Do you have any thoughts on the book with a capital B or however you want to approach it?

00:48.293 --> 00:57.281
I think that these advances in technology are very important for research institutions.

00:57.301 --> 01:01.105
It's, I presume, the only way to go simply in terms of space.

01:01.658 --> 01:02.960
And access, of course.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.365
And access, it's wonderful.

01:05.385 --> 01:20.933
But in the respect of the love of reading, the interaction, the communion with books, I am very old-fashioned and I really believe that the

01:21.487 --> 01:51.004
the physicality of that exchange where you can smell the book and see it and touch it and turn back the pages and re-read and linger and again go back. Nothing else can. And I think in a world where one gets more and more remote from whatever one may call reality from where things happen

01:51.406 --> 02:10.786
Because everything is at a distance, in a way, which removes the sense of responsibility for what you're doing.

02:10.806 --> 02:14.269
Even a nuclear war is made by somebody pressing a button and the bomb explodes over there.

02:14.289 --> 02:16.131
The book and its immediacy and its physicality, I think, retains something which is vital to

02:16.600 --> 02:20.244
to being human.

02:20.684 --> 02:44.667
Psychologists who've made tests with children or with monkeys or whatever who are deprived from contact with a mother where they never touched and they lose the whole dimension of being in the process and I think this sort of dimension which books can provide cannot be replaced by anything else.

02:46.148 --> 03:11.717
In your country, how important are books to the national... Well, in my country, in terms of reading, probably the prime problem at the moment is the fact that we have about 60% illiteracy in the country of the total population.

03:13.283 --> 03:31.466
Which means that, in fact, writers can't really start talking about their readership before massive programs of literacy have been mounted.

03:31.606 --> 03:41.198
In this process, books are tremendously important, but also the computers and CD-ROM and so on, to get these literacy programs rolling.

03:42.629 --> 04:01.569
But, again, it is that awareness that you are in touch with something now, physically in touch with something, which I think lends it a dimension of nothing else than supplant.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.751
I didn't realize that the literacy rate was that high.

04:02.771 --> 04:03.152
It's enormous, 60%.

04:04.094 --> 04:19.099
So when you're writing, then you write with the understanding that, right off the bat, six out of ten people can't, you can't reach 60% of the people in your commission.

04:19.620 --> 04:23.767
You're mindful of that when you're writing?

04:23.787 --> 04:24.468
It is a terrible film.

04:24.488 --> 04:28.735
Inevitably, one is shaped by a specific community and

04:29.525 --> 04:40.276
In your writing you direct yourself at this community in the first instance.

04:40.296 --> 04:41.880
And if six out of ten in this community can't read you, it creates problems.

04:44.037 --> 05:04.621
which is why during the years of the struggle for liberation so much of the really valid writing in the country that was done by black authors was in the form of poetry, plays, or very short stories that could be recited to deal with all the interest.

05:04.641 --> 05:06.483
The sound of a voice plays a very important role.

05:07.705 --> 05:09.707
And maybe one reason why now

05:10.312 --> 05:23.753
After an absence of over 20 years, I am also returning to the theatre.

05:23.773 --> 05:31.084
I've just finished my first play in 20 years, and it is a very particular joy to working in the theatre and writing for it.

05:31.104 --> 05:32.927
It is such an old cliché that writing is a lonely business.

05:33.228 --> 05:44.472
But when you're in the theatre and the interaction with actors and the director and the stage, that folds a kind of void which is very important.

05:44.492 --> 05:50.865
I just did an interview about three weeks ago with Neil Simon for his new work.

05:50.845 --> 05:58.941
You know, just the whole attitude of writing for performance.

05:58.961 --> 05:59.362
It's different.

05:59.382 --> 06:02.649
He reads his material aloud.

06:02.669 --> 06:05.234
He wants to hear the words.

06:05.314 --> 06:07.899
The way they will sound, you know, in tongues of actors.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.266
I just had a wonderful experience a month ago in Salzburg.

06:11.507 --> 06:12.128
There was a conference where...

06:13.103 --> 06:32.769
Three of us, Arthur Miller, Ariel Dorfman and I, had to conduct master classes and lecture and work with groups of actors and directors.

06:33.249 --> 06:34.451
Huge international gathering.

06:34.471 --> 06:36.373
And that really fired me up so much that we sang back.

06:36.654 --> 06:39.297
So this play that you're working on, is there an expectation that it will be...

06:41.285 --> 06:58.387
those people who are unable to read your books.

06:58.407 --> 07:03.614
That's what I hope, yes.

07:03.634 --> 07:06.097
So then, as a writer, you're still doing the same thing, still trying to reach people.

07:06.117 --> 07:06.378
Oh, yes, yes.

07:06.398 --> 07:07.359
I mean, ultimately, it's the same sort of thing.

07:07.379 --> 07:07.680
Medium, medium.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.802
I would think writing for performance is going to be even harder than writing for poetry.

07:09.822 --> 07:10.363
In a way, it is, because...

07:11.457 --> 07:27.099
In a way, it is always disheartening because there are always other people in between.

07:27.119 --> 07:34.570
Ultimately, it's the actor and his or her way of speaking that's going to get the message across or influence the audience or whatever.

07:34.590 --> 07:38.095
But I think you gain so much too in the process by exchanging your ideas and throwing them around and seeing them develop in their production.

07:38.115 --> 07:38.916
Of course, when you're writing...

07:39.436 --> 07:53.961
character for the stage, as Neil Simon said, he said he never thinks of an actor.

07:53.981 --> 07:56.926
He never even really visualizes the character, because the hope is, if it's really good, you know, the actors yet unborn would be kind of doing it.

07:56.946 --> 07:57.968
You know, when you're writing for a movie, well,

08:00.361 --> 08:10.040
a one-shot deal, it's only going to be done once.

08:10.060 --> 08:12.585
Yes, that's the story, yes.

08:12.605 --> 08:13.707
You know, a play on the other hand.

08:13.727 --> 08:20.580
Hundreds of times by different people, every time you can discover something new, even in an awful performance, it's usually just at least a moment here or there where you discover something new about yourself.

08:22.940 --> 08:30.494
I believe that your next interview is in 10 minutes, so I don't want to know... Well, I think we've covered all this amount of knowledge.

08:30.514 --> 08:31.956
Would you kindly inscribe that?

08:32.738 --> 08:35.062
Do you consider yourself a political person?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.204
Are you a political person?

08:36.324 --> 08:39.029
A political creature, so to speak?

08:39.049 --> 08:40.712
No, I'm not a political creature.

08:41.232 --> 09:04.675
I had to incorporate a lot of reasonably practical politics in my whole modus operandi during the apartheid years when I was only too aware of the fact that as a writer I had access to audiences across the world really and that as a result of that I had a certain responsibility

09:05.009 --> 09:12.818
towards people in South Africa who could not at that stage speak for themselves, make themselves heard of them.

09:12.838 --> 09:31.540
I was very close to many members of the ANC in exile, and at a time when that movement was proscribed in South Africa, I felt it was necessary for me to simply to let other people know what

09:32.701 --> 09:54.591
what the people inside the ANC were really like because they were just branded by the blanket term of terrorist and it was sometimes very difficult and amusing even to sit in Lusaka and listen to Beethoven's Fifth with one of these people and you're supposed to be a terrorist and it's so different.

09:55.229 --> 10:05.564
And just getting this across in the first instance to watch in South Africa.

10:05.584 --> 10:12.975
Not only a terrorist, but in some ways a savage.

10:12.995 --> 10:15.819
Do you ever listen to Beethoven?

10:15.839 --> 10:16.300
Certainly.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.622
Couldn't read.

10:17.642 --> 10:17.722
Yes.

10:17.742 --> 10:23.430
So I felt it was very important for me, since I had this measure of fluidity in my movements, to transmit something of what I'd witnessed.

10:24.693 --> 10:37.472
But now it is just as much of a pleasure to be able to be a writer who continues to have a real interest in what is happening politically.

10:37.492 --> 10:45.283
But that is part of a larger human scene and the politicians can and must now speak for themselves.

10:45.770 --> 11:01.047
a very important question all of a sudden.

11:01.267 --> 11:03.609
How many languages have you published?

11:03.629 --> 11:03.689
29.

11:03.709 --> 11:05.051
And 60% of the people in your own country are ready to get to read.

11:05.071 --> 11:06.713
So therefore, are you mindful of writing?

11:06.733 --> 11:07.233
Are you all the audience?

11:07.253 --> 11:11.558
Well, when I write in English, that is the kind of reader I have to bear in mind.

11:13.175 --> 11:30.087
But when I write an upper part... Are there any people outside of the borders of the country?

11:30.107 --> 11:31.329
Yes, yes, in the first instance when I write English.

11:31.349 --> 11:33.333
And obviously that must change something in the tone, in the approach, in the perspective one.

11:33.353 --> 11:34.175
You're alert to this, you're aware of it.

11:34.195 --> 11:34.275
Yes.

11:34.295 --> 11:35.778
And you certainly have no way of visualizing who the reader is.

11:35.798 --> 11:35.858
No.

11:35.878 --> 11:36.499
Potential reader is an opinion.

11:37.542 --> 11:42.669
No, in fact, if I would try to visualize that, I could be very far off the mark.

11:44.812 --> 11:45.433
That's fascinating.

11:45.453 --> 11:48.377
But you have to be mindful of it.

11:48.397 --> 11:53.084
I have to try, try to be aware of it.

11:53.104 --> 11:54.846
Do you hear from readers all over the world?

11:54.866 --> 11:59.112
Yes, that is one of the really profound pleasures of writing.

11:59.969 --> 12:13.354
Just to know that there are people out there who in fact read what I write, who respond to a touch, sometimes get angry more often than not, or respond very generously.

12:14.870 --> 12:18.034
Is course intelligent most of the time?

12:18.054 --> 12:18.615
All kinds.

12:18.915 --> 12:22.860
Some very, very naïve, gutsy things.

12:22.920 --> 12:40.202
One of the most touching responses I had very recently, a few months ago, and that apropos of a book that I published twenty years ago, An Instant in the Wind, was from a woman, an Indian woman, I think, living in Britain.

12:40.942 --> 12:47.472
wanting to know the address of somebody she could send flowers to to put on a grave of one of my characters.

12:47.492 --> 12:49.595
And it was a fictitious character.

12:49.615 --> 12:50.196
Wow.

12:50.216 --> 12:53.241
And I found that so touching.

12:53.261 --> 12:54.503
How did you respond?

12:54.703 --> 13:02.635
I had to explain to her as gently as possible that this was a fictitious character.

13:02.655 --> 13:06.360
But she also, she wrote back again and said, it doesn't matter.

13:06.521 --> 13:08.063
I know that person lived.

13:08.549 --> 13:12.875
Even if you didn't know her.

13:12.896 --> 13:13.577
I know she lived.

13:13.597 --> 13:14.518
What a feeling that must be.

13:14.538 --> 13:16.361
It is wonderful.

13:16.381 --> 13:17.402
You really did create.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.589
Yes, somebody's so alive to somebody else.

13:21.609 --> 13:26.596
You waved the wand and you created something out of imagination.

13:26.676 --> 13:27.197
It's magnificent now.

13:27.397 --> 13:30.262
And then briefly, what is the book on Shakespeare about?

13:30.282 --> 13:32.565
Is it about his time?

13:33.035 --> 13:55.465
It's just titled Destabilizing Shakespeare, in line with so many of the new readings, sort of deconstructive readings, but I don't try to do a vicious dismantling job or anything, but just to see what kinds of new meanings come to light if you read a bit differently, a bit off-key.

13:56.356 --> 13:59.683
And the gender issue is very central to that.

13:59.704 --> 14:11.530
The whole notion of kingship and the repressions that went on there and the discomfort that he and others must have felt by having a queen on the throne of England.

14:11.510 --> 14:17.018
And there were strange masked ways in which he found his way around that.

14:18.460 --> 14:21.504
And that was when he's changed.

14:21.524 --> 14:23.347
That was changed to Goldberg's 1603, I think.

14:23.467 --> 14:24.108
Oh, yes.

14:24.568 --> 14:25.189
Oh, yes.

14:25.209 --> 14:27.312
Yes.

14:27.893 --> 14:30.737
That is the miracle of that corpus of work.

14:31.018 --> 14:31.378
That's right.

14:31.398 --> 14:36.165
That it is so incredibly relevant to us today still.

14:36.185 --> 14:36.285
Yeah.

14:36.265 --> 14:48.785
You see, when people say, who needs to read these dead and white European novels?

14:48.805 --> 14:49.486
Because they're not relevant.

14:49.646 --> 14:51.068
You said, Jake, there's not a lot of them.

14:51.088 --> 14:51.168
God.

14:51.188 --> 14:53.111
He's as relevant as anyone I can possibly read.

14:53.131 --> 14:53.372
Oh, yes.

14:53.392 --> 14:53.612
Oh, yes.

14:53.632 --> 14:54.433
Well, I really have fun with this stuff.

14:54.453 --> 14:54.814
Now we have to go.
