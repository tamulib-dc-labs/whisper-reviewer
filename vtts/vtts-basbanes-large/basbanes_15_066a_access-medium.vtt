WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:03.839
Certainly we're not going to talk to you.

00:04.040 --> 00:04.821
I'm Michael Doris.

00:04.841 --> 00:06.323
I'm going to be right here in Boston.

00:06.363 --> 00:16.216
I don't see the point of discussing the novel because that certainly speaks eloquently enough for itself.

00:16.236 --> 00:23.085
But I guess I am interested, as everybody is interested, in this collaborative work of art.

00:23.706 --> 00:30.375
Certainly writing a novel is traditionally, historically, I cannot think of many instances where

00:31.486 --> 00:36.552
more than one mind comes together to produce a novel.

00:36.572 --> 00:40.357
I mean, or any number of other works.

00:40.377 --> 00:43.781
Maybe we could talk about, and I certainly know that you've worked together also.

00:44.061 --> 00:48.727
I don't know what word you would use as consulting each other.

00:50.088 --> 00:51.530
Well, more than that.

00:51.730 --> 00:56.776
We've had a kind of collaborative relationship all along in the novels.

00:57.698 --> 01:01.442
The person whose name is going to be on the book writes

01:01.827 --> 01:19.843
the graphs, but they get passed back and forth all through the process, and the other person is very free to say, this isn't working, this is working, why don't you move the direction of the book here, scrap this.

01:20.583 --> 01:26.108
It's more than an editor because it forms it as it's going along.

01:26.268 --> 01:31.733
I think most editors, you wait until the book is finished and you turn it in, and then they make suggestions, but in this case,

01:32.253 --> 01:50.410
It's a word-by-word kind of thing, and we talk about the characters before anything is written, have a general sense of the book, and then it surprises the writer as he or she goes along, but that surprise is then shared on a daily basis, usually.

01:51.471 --> 01:58.378
But each of us write in separate rooms, and that was true for this book as well, except that we were both

01:59.017 --> 02:02.966
producing the initial text in about the same way.

02:03.146 --> 02:05.371
Are you writing at the same time?

02:05.832 --> 02:13.870
I mean, even though you have different voices and you kind of alternate voices, obviously,

02:14.204 --> 02:16.967
Can you write your segment?

02:17.067 --> 02:19.330
You have to wait for Michael's segment.

02:19.350 --> 02:19.870
No, no.

02:19.890 --> 02:24.075
If you go, we work backwards.

02:25.076 --> 02:32.405
It's like putting both together when you're writing a linear book.

02:32.425 --> 02:37.671
And we figure out a plot in any number of ways.

02:37.771 --> 02:42.456
As we're going along, something suggests itself, or we're taking a walk and we get an idea.

02:43.027 --> 02:47.152
the character, what's going to happen.

02:47.213 --> 02:54.762
One of us just has inspiration and just starts writing it and brings it to the other end and says, this is what happened.

02:54.782 --> 02:56.965
Which the other person might disagree with.

02:57.005 --> 02:58.327
No, no, this isn't working.

02:58.347 --> 03:06.838
But it doesn't happen that often that one of us really thinks the character is going some particular way.

03:06.858 --> 03:09.642
So the novel is pretty thoroughly applied.

03:10.094 --> 03:12.337
Well, it's very fluid.

03:12.437 --> 03:17.883
It's hard to describe this because there's no real technique that I think we haven't really quantified this.

03:18.144 --> 03:38.768
Let's say we think it is heavily plotted at first and then it never turns out to be what we expected it to be because at a certain point you get to know your characters so well that you just simply drop them into a situation and instead of them doing something predictable, they do something unpredictable because they are who they are and you have to kind of follow them.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.502
rather than confine them.

03:41.963 --> 03:50.273
Do you think as one writer here, or are you two different, is it a synergistic kind of thing?

03:50.293 --> 03:52.976
Yeah, I don't think we think as one person.

03:52.996 --> 04:01.327
I mean, I think that we think as a couple of individuals who really have a booking line and who try to work.

04:01.347 --> 04:05.532
I mean, we don't have, we don't know what the other person is going to come up with.

04:06.558 --> 04:20.813
I think somehow this is really easier in a first-person narrative novel like this is, like our others have been, because it really is the characters who are operating, and we invest the characters.

04:21.194 --> 04:36.430
But once they're in place, when you're doing only a first person, they can only know what they know, and they can only react as they would react, and you don't have the kind of omniscience that maybe an overreaching single-voiced person would have.

04:36.967 --> 04:44.695
because there is this other character besides us involved, and that is Vivian Two Star, Roger Williams, or Nash.

04:45.896 --> 04:54.185
Whatever we may want from them, they are defined by their history, by their history that has been created for them.

04:54.205 --> 04:57.808
Do you have any word to describe what you've done here?

04:58.129 --> 05:01.472
How would you describe the product?

05:01.492 --> 05:02.593
What would you call it?

05:02.613 --> 05:03.514
This book?

05:05.570 --> 05:10.958
It is different, as a literary one.

05:11.058 --> 05:27.342
How many novels that are treated as literary works are done by more than one person?

05:28.283 --> 05:35.053
I think that rather than say it's different because that happens, you have to start by saying is it different because it's different.

05:35.219 --> 06:05.108
I think this book is different because we intended to violate all sorts of conventions.

06:05.628 --> 06:34.538
Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.: Male Speaker 1.:

06:35.092 --> 06:41.684
that is put in very consciously right at the moment when you expect the action to unfold.

06:42.866 --> 06:58.855
And the point of all of that, I think, for us, and these were conscious choices, we tried writing this novel in many different ways, in the voice of Columbus, in a sort of historical way, intermittent Columbus and the present and everything.

06:59.273 --> 07:05.562
I think that the intent was to reflect the chaos of discovery.

07:06.263 --> 07:12.792
When two people or two cultures are coming to encounter with each other, they don't know what's going to happen next.

07:12.892 --> 07:19.701
It's full of surprise and accidents and anecdotes and aggression and all of that kind of stuff.

07:21.143 --> 07:27.272
The poem is finally a way for the historical voice to assert itself.

07:27.809 --> 07:36.518
And also, it proves that Roger is who he says he is, that he really can write a poem, and proves that he's in the cave a long time.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.303
One more thing that I'll shut up today.

07:41.463 --> 07:46.048
The poem, we got very fond of Roger in the course of this book.

07:46.308 --> 07:48.170
And we thought, what would he do with this poem?

07:48.190 --> 07:52.434
And we thought he'd want it to be published in a classy literary journal.

07:52.454 --> 07:55.858
Caliban came to mind because of The Tempest, of course.

07:56.092 --> 07:59.895
And so we sent it to them, and it's in the current Caliban under Roger Williams.

08:00.476 --> 08:07.662
We submitted it as Roger's poem, and so that was our, that was his proudest accomplishment.

08:07.682 --> 08:17.851
Would you call this an experiment, an experimental work, or was it just a natural progression from the kinds of things we've done together in the past?

08:17.871 --> 08:19.313
I think it's a natural progression.

08:20.153 --> 08:25.558
I don't... I guess when something has...

08:25.741 --> 08:36.757
The word experimental attached to it, you think it's just going to be... It's not going to be a good story.

08:37.197 --> 08:41.484
It's not going to be a story, yeah.

08:41.504 --> 08:43.426
It's going to be a good storytelling as much as anything else, I think.

08:43.446 --> 08:44.448
It is a natural progression.

08:45.629 --> 08:50.196
It's still personal voices, and it's still...

08:51.475 --> 09:06.531
Although I think one thing that's very different is this little story that frames it, and we use this very small story of the girl finding the baby, what it means to lose the baby, to hurt it, and to frame it.

09:06.697 --> 09:19.511
the whole big story, the little hook ends for the rest of the story.

09:19.792 --> 09:28.061
Of course, discovery, as Michael pointed out, is certainly the spark as we approach the 500th anniversary.

09:28.081 --> 09:33.047
I'm just curious about the creator of Wellsprings and this thing.

09:33.067 --> 09:35.269
Were we thinking about 1492 and 1992?

09:35.620 --> 09:37.782
Ten years we've worked on this book.

09:37.882 --> 09:41.346
Ten years, that's an important piece of information.

09:41.366 --> 09:43.308
Well, I mean, not constantly.

09:43.328 --> 09:53.117
Obviously, we've turned other things in in the meantime, but we were taking a trip ten years ago and stopped in a little town in a rainstorm and went to the library until afternoon.

09:53.638 --> 09:54.879
You love this library.

09:55.079 --> 09:59.564
It was a little underground library in North Dakota.

09:59.604 --> 10:02.046
You've walked down this little basement steps.

10:02.306 --> 10:03.588
Of course, nobody in there.

10:03.608 --> 10:04.969
You just checked out your own books.

10:05.253 --> 10:06.755
There was only about 200 people in the town.

10:06.775 --> 10:08.056
It was under a book store.

10:08.436 --> 10:09.938
It was sort of irresistible.

10:10.919 --> 10:13.041
Minnowak and the U Library.

10:13.162 --> 10:21.391
There on the table is Los Passos' Columbus translation or excerpts.

10:21.551 --> 10:23.193
This is about 10 years ago.

10:23.213 --> 10:25.475
Yes, about 81.

10:26.816 --> 10:27.978
We started reading it.

10:28.018 --> 10:31.902
I think we both probably had a vague idea of Columbus.

10:32.776 --> 10:44.877
maybe even glanced at it before, but in the downpour outside and the kind of enforced reading room sense, it was like Vivian in a way.

10:45.599 --> 10:48.344
She was trapped in a library and discovered it.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.438
We got interested in him as a character because Las Casas

10:56.654 --> 11:01.561
reproduces only certain parts of the diary for his own political agenda.

11:01.581 --> 11:02.783
But there's these big gaps.

11:03.123 --> 11:12.777
First, there's this guy who is a utopian who sees the first Native people and who thinks they're beautiful and gentle and guileless.

11:13.118 --> 11:19.026
And yes, they make good servants, but clearly they're human beings.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.530
And then Las Casas leaves out stuff.

11:21.550 --> 11:25.395
And then the next thing we know, and later on, he's bringing them back as slaves.

11:26.067 --> 11:32.174
and becomes the first slavery of the Western Hemisphere.

11:32.194 --> 11:33.876
What happened, basically?

11:33.896 --> 11:35.518
What happened psychologically?

11:35.538 --> 11:38.381
What happened historically?

11:38.782 --> 11:39.743
There just were gaps.

11:40.764 --> 11:46.090
Then we started figuring out who Columbus was and found out that he kept lots of diaries.

11:46.550 --> 11:49.574
Each of them was like the vanilla ice of his day.

11:49.594 --> 11:53.498
He told a different story to every person he was talking to.

11:53.598 --> 11:54.960
Very self-conscious.

11:55.615 --> 11:59.882
master of himself because he probably had something to hide.

11:59.902 --> 12:05.070
Probably he was son of conversos or he was this or he was that.

12:05.371 --> 12:07.734
We haven't figured out who he was.

12:08.375 --> 12:12.883
But anybody who has that many faces is an interesting character.

12:13.544 --> 12:16.148
His son was a collector.

12:16.448 --> 12:21.336
Columbus decided to respond to a lot of them.

12:22.193 --> 12:25.080
You mean was Nick Ferdinand?

12:25.221 --> 12:27.125
Yeah, I think so.

12:27.286 --> 12:37.030
Somebody mentioned actually the other day, and I should look at Columbus's son, but the reason is that perhaps a lot of what we know of Columbus as a result of

12:37.820 --> 12:38.501
It is.

12:38.621 --> 12:44.207
It's what the son chose to keep and then keep.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.390
Oh, that's a whole interesting story in itself.

12:47.410 --> 12:50.353
What happened to his papers and the squabble.

12:50.413 --> 12:53.416
He never kind of stepped it up.

12:53.436 --> 12:54.277
None of his stuff.

12:54.377 --> 13:07.371
I mean, the wonderful thing about this and what is so intriguing once you start to think about the actual viaries is how they were lost and how...

13:08.161 --> 13:27.783
One story which may or may not be true is that after Columbus brought the first diary and gave it to Isabel, and she had a copy, a Barcelona copy made, given back to Columbus, she kept the original and it was not seen after she died.

13:28.003 --> 13:37.273
And one of the stories is that when Napoleon invaded Silantres and quartered his army,

13:37.928 --> 13:40.251
around the castle.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.273
The whole library was taken out.

13:42.293 --> 13:46.678
The man out of Sprawn used to bed the horses.

13:46.698 --> 14:00.474
And it probably was pitched out with the... And the other thing that happened was he used diaries on the second voyage.

14:01.335 --> 14:04.138
He ran into a terrible gale coming back.

14:04.658 --> 14:09.086
and wrapped them very carefully in an oil closet.

14:09.346 --> 14:14.616
And there was this wonderful discovery name.

14:14.636 --> 14:20.386
Well, someone claimed to have discovery for those long ago.

14:23.172 --> 14:23.993
It's just wonderful stuff.

14:24.033 --> 14:28.962
There are a number of cases in history where we have stories.

14:29.262 --> 14:30.163
Not unlikely.

14:30.304 --> 14:30.644
Yes.

14:30.905 --> 14:34.410
And so some of them finally boiled up.

14:34.430 --> 14:44.305
The only problem was, it was this big discovery, but they were all written in English.

14:44.345 --> 14:52.418
The other funny thing that happened with this book, which happened all along, is that we would think we were making something up.

14:52.752 --> 14:56.318
And then further research would yield that it was not plausible.

14:56.538 --> 15:01.326
They don't want to give away the crown of thorns, but the crown of thorns really was something called the crown of thorns.

15:01.346 --> 15:04.291
It was bouncing around Europe at that time, we later discovered.

15:04.311 --> 15:08.538
We had thought of the crown of thorns before we knew anything about it as a metaphor.

15:08.558 --> 15:12.805
And the Saint-Chapelle was built to be the jewel box for it.

15:12.825 --> 15:18.034
And then it was in the possession of Genoese sailors.

15:19.516 --> 15:23.061
They're bringing it.

15:23.081 --> 15:26.245
They're going to bring us a snack.

15:26.345 --> 15:32.413
Actually, I got you some notes.

15:32.954 --> 15:35.517
No, no, go ahead.

15:35.538 --> 15:36.439
She's never been with me.

15:36.579 --> 15:39.242
I've done about 500, 600 interviews.

15:39.283 --> 15:42.467
This is the very first time she's ever been on.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.591
I'm so glad you came along.

15:46.145 --> 16:11.663
It's very interesting that this project was conceived ten years ago, and then in the interim, you've done three novels a year old, you've done two or three books a year old.

16:11.683 --> 16:14.667
So let's talk a little bit about that.

16:15.136 --> 16:18.801
I guess we work that way.

16:18.981 --> 16:31.980
You know, you get an idea for something and it just kicks around and stays there for a long time.

16:32.180 --> 16:39.090
And I can go back to my notebook and find the title of the book I'm looking at now.

16:39.891 --> 16:42.274
I thought of when I was

16:42.490 --> 16:47.396
over in Alston, here, which was 15 years ago.

16:48.837 --> 16:58.368
And I was just having to look through some old notebooks and realize that's how long things take to get through the psychological process or however it works.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.430
It takes a long time.

17:02.272 --> 17:11.603
And I tend to work in little increments and I think we both work

17:11.903 --> 17:21.137
You know, we worked slowly through to come up.

17:21.157 --> 17:27.566
The idea gathers and collects weight and we had to read a book here and take one down there.

17:27.587 --> 17:31.392
And one of the things we did to try and get a sense of Columbus was read what he read.

17:31.813 --> 17:33.616
Because his print had kept his library.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.277
That was beautifully kept.

17:34.297 --> 17:38.603
With wonderful notes that Columbus had made in the margins.

17:39.342 --> 17:42.759
with his Bible and St.

17:42.780 --> 17:42.920
Gustin.

17:43.101 --> 17:45.252
That's a picture of a question you get in the right book.

17:45.873 --> 17:50.860
That kind of detail should really be in my book.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.143
It's wonderful.

17:53.163 --> 17:55.987
My book is coming out next year.

17:56.007 --> 17:56.207
That's 92?

17:56.227 --> 17:56.327
Yeah.

17:56.447 --> 17:56.748
Oh, yeah.

17:56.768 --> 17:57.409
Oh, that's great.

17:57.429 --> 18:08.924
That wonderful, um, Wondersar that he, in all of his purposes, would see, Wonders as God in the Depths, I think he wrote that in a little bit of a margin of, you know, only.

18:08.944 --> 18:11.728
The most important part of my book is how collectors,

18:12.046 --> 18:22.162
I mean, we're obsessed, of course, but in the process, you preserve the product of achievements, human, whatever, you know.

18:22.182 --> 18:28.332
I have any number of very interesting little stories that you mention, you know, all the stuff overboard.

18:28.613 --> 18:39.150
And the Linda's Fine Gospels, and, you know, when they sacked the monastery in the 1500s, they stole that, and they took that for the

18:39.569 --> 18:50.124
for the binding, which was actually, and then they discarded the book, and the book was rescued, and then there's a story about it actually being seen floating in the water.

18:50.244 --> 18:58.356
I guess while it was still in this extraordinary binding, it was saved, and of course you go into the British Library, and it was surrounded by... Floating in the water?

18:58.576 --> 19:08.530
Yeah, yes, and I'll have to find out precisely how that came to that, but I mean, it's, you know, this magnificent illuminated manuscript going to the British Library, it's number two or three there,

19:08.982 --> 19:15.070
It's a collector who grabbed it and saved it.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.833
We read and reviewed it.

19:17.893 --> 19:28.306
We read and reviewed a book on the Cosmo ghetto in Lithuania about a year ago, I guess it was.

19:28.406 --> 19:35.715
That was a fascinating story because what the man did is kept the secretary of the ghetto council, kept the meticulous journal,

19:36.252 --> 19:49.526
He put in all of the orders that the Nazis had, which were these little instrumental things, the daily things that Jews may not have, tropical fish or cats or something like that.

19:49.566 --> 19:53.590
You see the accumulation of the horror that's going on.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.512
Next to, Jewish women may not be pregnant.

19:55.612 --> 19:55.893
Right.

19:56.353 --> 19:57.354
What was this again?

19:57.595 --> 20:00.317
It's the Kavno Ghetto Diary.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.800
It's something the Holocaust survived.

20:02.982 --> 20:04.243
How do you spell it?

20:04.624 --> 20:05.905
It's K-O-V-N-O.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.870
I think it's Surviving the Holocaust.

20:09.890 --> 20:11.952
It's Harvard Press, isn't it?

20:11.992 --> 20:13.274
Harvard Press?

20:13.794 --> 20:16.838
I'll check it out.

20:16.878 --> 20:27.910
The story is that when it was clear that the ghetto was going to be destroyed, he buried all of these papers in the foundation of a building that was buried.

20:28.447 --> 20:30.410
He ran off to the partisans.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.972
The ghetto was completely destroyed.

20:32.032 --> 20:33.053
Everybody was gone.

20:33.474 --> 20:34.696
It was bombed and everything.

20:34.736 --> 20:50.138
And then he and that four or five others came back after the war and dug up the foundation and strapped parts of these diaries to their bodies and then split up through Europe to meet in Palestine and put it together.

20:50.358 --> 20:54.964
And some of them didn't make it, and so there are holes in it, and put it back together again.

20:55.145 --> 20:56.867
But it was remarkable how much of it created.

20:57.640 --> 21:03.146
you know, the transmission of documents, not just collecting.

21:03.166 --> 21:10.954
And it's a whole other story of the Holocaust, because it is this very minute, daily... Where did you run across this?

21:11.034 --> 21:12.376
We reviewed it.

21:12.436 --> 21:14.498
We reviewed it for the Chicago Review, and I reviewed it for Newsday.

21:14.618 --> 21:16.420
And when was it published?

21:16.440 --> 21:17.361
Last year.

21:17.601 --> 21:21.365
Harvard Press, you think?

21:21.385 --> 21:23.848
I'll find it.

21:23.868 --> 21:24.188
It's easy to do.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.982
I'm trying not to ask you this.

21:26.002 --> 21:39.461
I've got a whole plan on your interviews, and I know that people are asking me the same things over and over again, and I have that material to drop on, so if it seems like I'm not covering the obvious, it's because I have so much.

21:40.101 --> 21:41.223
Oh, thank you.

21:42.405 --> 21:49.234
I was with Kitty Kelly the day before yesterday, you know, on the Reagan book.

21:50.335 --> 21:53.820
The title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.470
I'll send it to you.

21:59.092 --> 22:04.960
In fact, give me your address and I'll make sure.

22:04.980 --> 22:10.607
I was going to bring a copy today.

22:10.687 --> 22:10.987
Box 70.

22:11.007 --> 22:12.609
Box 70.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.913
Cornish Blast.

22:15.933 --> 22:16.534
N.H.

22:17.678 --> 22:26.286
Yeah, here's a fun little piece.

22:27.227 --> 22:31.450
And is it going to be part of the film?

22:31.470 --> 22:32.752
Not really.

22:32.772 --> 22:34.113
I did it as a lot of the stuff that's in there.

22:34.133 --> 22:37.055
I mean, I started with Henry Huntington in 1911.

22:37.075 --> 22:38.277
I went to the University of Texas.

22:38.297 --> 22:42.340
I went to the University of Texas.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.442
And all the sales I went to in New York and I brought those in.

22:44.462 --> 22:47.685
I mean, it's really a mishmash.

22:48.053 --> 22:55.984
but with a theme, you know, this madness to acquire and collect.

22:56.004 --> 22:58.448
So what are you working on next?

22:58.468 --> 23:04.336
Are you going to continue this kind of collaboration, do you think?

23:04.356 --> 23:05.898
I don't think so.

23:05.958 --> 23:08.562
At least I don't think the next ones are going to be.

23:09.623 --> 23:12.748
What you are is separate.

23:12.768 --> 23:15.211
Well, we have separate corners, anyway.

23:15.231 --> 23:17.875
And we started working on that.

23:18.395 --> 23:25.324
books that have a lot more... They just aren't collaborative.

23:25.344 --> 23:32.433
I can't define why this particular one was, and why these aren't.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.576
You do work in separate parts of the house?

23:35.697 --> 23:36.017
Sure do.

23:36.878 --> 23:41.945
One week, in fact I wrote these two together, I had to do it.

23:41.985 --> 23:47.592
Michael Holroyd and Margaret Gravel were following each other, like within days.

23:47.757 --> 23:51.121
They both had books on her at the same time with different publishing houses.

23:51.621 --> 23:53.363
One was a random house and the other was a Viking.

23:53.383 --> 23:57.207
And I said, gee, you know, you're going to the same cities.

23:57.307 --> 24:00.190
Why couldn't the two houses get together?

24:00.210 --> 24:03.054
And they said, believe me, we went through this.

24:03.074 --> 24:11.863
They thought Viking, you know, thought that maybe Michael would get more attention than the other one thought.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.085
You know, they each had their own agenda to pursue.

24:14.105 --> 24:15.587
So they had to, they basically,

24:16.225 --> 24:18.547
followed each other by three or four days.

24:18.567 --> 24:23.152
So at the end of the whole writing interview, he said, will you see Margaret?

24:23.172 --> 24:27.716
He said, say hello to Margaret.

24:27.796 --> 24:29.118
But then I had to write the two together.

24:29.138 --> 24:33.962
But you know, they actually write in different houses, different parts of London.

24:34.002 --> 24:40.288
They find that they have to really be separate to produce.

24:40.329 --> 24:42.891
And I guess in your cases, it's

24:43.107 --> 24:51.978
When it really comes down to the point of creation, that's where you go by yourself.

24:52.078 --> 24:54.641
Is that a fair initial creation?

24:54.681 --> 25:07.656
We go back and forth with the drafts currently a lot, and we read the books aloud to each other a couple of times before they go out, and changes get made at that point.

25:08.257 --> 25:12.642
As with dialogue, we try out with each other and that kind of thing.

25:13.347 --> 25:19.774
And then every day we rendezvous for a long walk and check out what has happened.

25:19.794 --> 25:24.059
You won't believe what so-and-so just did today, you know, kind of thing.

25:24.079 --> 25:25.021
On ideal days.

25:25.281 --> 25:27.984
On ideal days without PTA meeting dentists.

25:28.004 --> 25:32.229
Are you working along parallel courses, do you think?

25:32.309 --> 25:38.376
I mean, are you ahead of Michael or are you ahead of Louise?

25:39.638 --> 25:58.231
We work at different hours, too, sometimes, so I might be working part of the day, and Michael thinks, you know, I'm usually sleeping in my great work, and Michael's very wonderfully early rising, but, um... The best time.

25:58.251 --> 25:59.453
The earlier, the better, it's made to improve the lifestyle.

25:59.990 --> 26:03.936
I can get night's sleep to get started.

26:04.376 --> 26:06.760
Do you like to work in the evening?

26:06.960 --> 26:12.388
Well, I'm in the morning, but I just don't get up at 10 or 4.

26:12.448 --> 26:12.768
3 o'clock?

26:13.029 --> 26:17.335
Well, when I'm cooking, when it's really in there.

26:19.738 --> 26:26.468
But we have a lot of kids, so we have to fit it in.

26:26.488 --> 26:28.731
There's not a lot of time for...

26:29.082 --> 26:33.948
fooling around.

26:34.348 --> 26:41.957
I asked Louise, who had stepped away, about continuing this kind of collaboration.

26:43.839 --> 26:45.962
And she said, well, perhaps, but not right now.

26:45.982 --> 26:55.613
Is that... Yeah, I think if the subject would equally grab us, and we were... I mean, we had to wait a long time for us both to have...

26:56.200 --> 26:59.363
to be between the other books to do this together.

27:00.584 --> 27:05.850
There was nothing in this that would discourage us from doing it again.

27:05.870 --> 27:07.531
The book was writing.

27:07.572 --> 27:08.392
It was a lot of fun.

27:08.793 --> 27:12.496
I think also you had to establish your own identities first.

27:12.777 --> 27:13.918
That's probably true.

27:13.938 --> 27:14.378
Yeah.

27:14.398 --> 27:21.105
I mean, a collaborative book from two unknowns is not going to make it.

27:21.185 --> 27:25.870
But now, of course, with the solid reputations that you have,

27:26.086 --> 27:29.311
well-earned and newly recognized.

27:29.351 --> 27:34.720
Maybe it's more of an acceptable... I don't know.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.867
I think that would be a tough one to start with.

27:38.947 --> 27:39.367
It would.

27:39.548 --> 27:41.331
You're right.

27:41.531 --> 27:46.198
And it also would be impossible to write to start with.

27:46.218 --> 27:50.946
We had to work towards having...

27:52.546 --> 27:58.293
giving up some of that ego attachment to the individual book.

27:59.475 --> 28:05.422
But I think your readers have to know who the authors are for this kind of book.

28:05.442 --> 28:08.666
I think that's a fair assessment.

28:08.686 --> 28:09.547
It certainly helps.

28:09.567 --> 28:14.353
You come with baggage, which is positive.

28:14.373 --> 28:17.017
The perception of the two of you is excellent.

28:17.037 --> 28:19.259
And so you start with that.

28:19.279 --> 28:21.422
I don't know if that's a fair assessment.

28:21.706 --> 28:30.719
Well, you know, but the other thing is, I think too much can be made that we work together about, you know.

28:30.739 --> 28:32.161
I mean, a lot is made of it.

28:32.181 --> 28:39.812
Well, I know, and I think that... But, you know, that's interesting.

28:39.832 --> 28:43.758
And some people write in the nude, and some people do this, and some people do this.

28:43.778 --> 28:46.562
But what ultimately matters is books.

28:46.582 --> 28:48.625
And, you know, our...

28:50.208 --> 28:55.236
I mean, clearly what we wanted is for somebody to pick up this book and read it and take it as a book.

28:55.737 --> 29:02.929
I mean, it was unusual that in Yellow Rattle, I wrote in the voice of three women, you know, and I'm not a woman.

29:02.990 --> 29:05.153
Well, that's an unusual thing.

29:05.173 --> 29:10.502
But people read the book and that isn't what they're thinking about all the way through.

29:10.522 --> 29:12.165
Or if it is, then it's not done well.

29:12.533 --> 29:27.408
And if they read this book and they think all the way through, this must have been written by two different people, then... Not necessarily, yeah, because, and that's a question I should have brought up, but it just seems so obvious, because the two of you do write in so many different voices in the same work.

29:27.428 --> 29:35.035
I mean, Love, Medicine, there's so many voices in page 7, 8, 9, I forget, you know, it was expressed, and I mean, every one of them worked.

29:35.055 --> 29:38.018
You know, we had young students and old people, we had that, and we had that, and we had that.

29:38.588 --> 29:44.314
That's really difficult, isn't it, writing on the voice of the opposite sex, or is it?

29:46.177 --> 29:53.545
It's not that voice is really speaking.

29:53.565 --> 29:53.965
It isn't any harder.

29:53.985 --> 30:00.633
I know Mary Gordon has said to me the reason she doesn't write about men is because she can't really do it.

30:01.274 --> 30:03.516
I mean, she says she feels very uncomfortable.

30:04.745 --> 30:09.792
trying to entail sexuality is her phrase.

30:09.812 --> 30:17.143
I think it probably has to do with the way you grow up in your family.

30:17.183 --> 30:24.173
Michael grew up with women, I grew up in a real mixture, but with very strong attachments to uncles, father, brothers.

30:24.914 --> 30:32.625
And you internalize things about, for me, about men that don't seem

30:33.010 --> 30:40.542
at all out of my experience.

30:41.083 --> 30:51.479
I'm very felt with my dad or whatever, you know, so that stuff doesn't seem out of my grasp.

30:52.280 --> 30:59.271
And I have, I guess, an intense sympathy for men that I might not have if I never experienced what it was to have to help a little brother out or something.

30:59.740 --> 31:16.663
So, I really think it's how you are formed in a family and who you're close to.

31:16.683 --> 31:18.766
Are you working on love now?

31:18.786 --> 31:19.647
Are you working on anything now?

31:19.667 --> 31:19.847
Oh, yeah.

31:19.868 --> 31:21.810
It's called Heels of Burning Love.

31:21.830 --> 31:23.873
It's called Heels of Burning Love.

31:23.893 --> 31:24.634
And it's a book about...

31:28.799 --> 31:42.496
It's a collection of stories, but here's how they get told.

31:43.317 --> 31:51.467
It's about a group of women who like to go out and play blackjack, gambling as legal happens.

31:51.487 --> 31:55.752
And they get stuck in a blizzard in a car.

31:56.643 --> 32:07.639
They get stuck overnight, and in order to keep themselves alive, really, each one has to tell the tale of burning love about themselves that will keep the others awake.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.945
So as you fall asleep, you freeze to death.

32:11.965 --> 32:14.288
So each one of them has to come up with something.

32:15.850 --> 32:23.822
And they have to be a certain length, because every 45 minutes you have to go out and knock the snow out of the exhaust pipe.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.245
It's that kind of, you know,

32:26.647 --> 32:30.032
We travel... Drawing the stories along.

32:30.493 --> 32:34.459
And do you talk this over with, Michael?

32:34.519 --> 32:36.282
Oh, yes.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.584
It's more than talk over.

32:37.604 --> 32:39.246
We work on the manuscript.

32:39.266 --> 32:39.667
Really?

32:40.088 --> 32:41.189
Sure.

32:41.209 --> 32:41.910
And how about yourself?

32:41.930 --> 32:43.413
What are you working on?

32:43.433 --> 32:44.755
A novel called The Dark Snake.

32:45.736 --> 32:54.249
And it is about how a single act of revenge works its way through several generations.

32:54.269 --> 32:55.371
Old woman who...

32:55.857 --> 33:15.368
has two sons and the younger one is killed and she decides her allegiances to him and that that decision affects the life of her other son and his children and their children over the course of the next 30-40 years.

33:15.770 --> 33:41.915
Talk to me about, and it's so obvious, but talk to me about the importance of voice in all these various works, and how do you contribute to the formation of the articulation of the voice of whatever.

33:41.935 --> 33:43.797
I mean, voice is such an important element in all of the books, even in the non-fiction book.

33:43.817 --> 33:45.118
It's a non-fiction work, but yet it's written in literary skills.

33:45.470 --> 33:49.654
Yes.

33:49.714 --> 33:50.355
Here we go.

33:50.475 --> 33:51.036
Thank you.

33:54.459 --> 33:55.700
Okay.

33:55.720 --> 33:56.201
Thank you.

33:58.283 --> 34:09.033
All right.

34:09.053 --> 34:10.735
First, some milk.

34:11.153 --> 34:24.623
Oh, good.

34:25.312 --> 34:49.041
One of the books that you read, the only copy in North America is at Williams.

34:49.061 --> 34:50.602
Williams has a great collection.

34:50.622 --> 34:54.467
And so, you know, this is neat to see it.

34:54.487 --> 34:55.028
Right, the Charles Letters.

34:55.048 --> 34:55.268
He was...

34:55.805 --> 35:15.096
The books are the clue to he couldn't be who he says he was, because he portrays himself as this mercenary, illiterate, who was washed overboard and held onto a spar very melodramatically and washed onto the shore of Portugal, and the rest is history.

35:15.599 --> 35:26.832
Then he starts reading, within a couple of years, all of these books, and Latin, and Pauli, and Esgras, and St.

35:26.893 --> 35:29.636
Augustine, and everything like that.

35:29.656 --> 35:34.442
It couldn't be that this person had no background.

35:34.462 --> 35:44.053
Of course, everybody, me, every educated person thought the world was round in those days, but Columbus's

35:44.776 --> 35:50.604
gimmick, that the world was rather small, so that this was a vast route.

35:50.704 --> 35:59.777
And the thing about him that also is interesting as a character, and almost as a comic character, you go with Bergson's notion of what is comedy.

35:59.797 --> 36:01.640
Comedy is rigidity.

36:02.041 --> 36:03.583
Columbus was absolutely rigid.

36:03.603 --> 36:07.008
Once he made up his mind what he was going to find, it had to be that.

36:07.589 --> 36:12.255
And he went through his grave insisting that this was Japan.

36:12.275 --> 36:14.158
All evidence to the contrary.

36:14.459 --> 36:27.638
And so, in a sense, it makes him a tragic figure, but it also makes him kind of a comic figure, because he couldn't see what was there, even though what was there was better than what he thought he was looking for.

36:27.658 --> 36:33.987
And so when we do our Columbus, modern-day Columbus, at Vivian and Nash,

36:34.507 --> 36:40.055
and Roger and so forth, each with their various quests and so forth.

36:40.075 --> 36:43.280
The question for them is, do you have to be that rich?

36:43.300 --> 36:47.126
Do you have to insist that what you find is what you expect?

36:48.108 --> 36:53.897
And the thing that we got very fond of Roger about is that he is able to change.

36:53.917 --> 37:01.408
I mean, he moves from this very tight, self-protective, terrified, a payoff guy,

37:01.793 --> 37:16.886
and to a person who can achieve a spontaneous Adam.

37:16.906 --> 37:19.469
And Vivian believes her own blood, finally.

37:19.489 --> 37:20.029
And that is her progress.

37:20.049 --> 37:20.750
And Nash grows up.

37:20.770 --> 37:20.970
Thank God.

37:21.370 --> 37:25.954
That's another thing.

37:25.974 --> 37:28.637
The love story was, again, part of the storytelling that he thought of.

37:29.617 --> 37:30.298
He had this challenge.

37:31.190 --> 38:01.078
I think the only other thing I would say, and you asked a question before about whether this was an experiment

38:01.497 --> 38:04.881
In a way, each of our books have been an experiment.

38:05.001 --> 38:14.893
I mean, the cardinal rule that we have followed from the beginning is that we don't replicate the previous book, and that we take some risks.

38:14.913 --> 38:27.387
And, you know, The Beat Queen was a real departure for blood medicine, and Trax was a departure for The Beat Queen, and Gallagher was a departure for the others, and Book of Courage, and this, so that every book

38:28.278 --> 38:32.906
that's come along after the first one, people have said, you didn't write the previous book.

38:33.667 --> 38:33.887
Yeah.

38:34.188 --> 38:36.171
That's the idea.

38:36.191 --> 38:40.899
Well, the book could actually be something almost because you had to write it.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.742
I don't know if that's part of the progression.

38:42.763 --> 38:49.394
I think it's part of the progression because of exactly what you said about it, and that is that it is written in a certain way.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.658
I mean, because it is a literary work.

38:51.738 --> 38:52.719
It's a literary work.

38:52.739 --> 38:54.302
I mean, it could have been an article.

38:54.856 --> 39:18.797
in that sense, in terms of what I had to write to find that information.

39:18.817 --> 39:19.418
But we really, it was a story.

39:19.438 --> 39:20.839
It was a story that had these reverberations every day.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.000
I still get, or we still get, maybe four letters a day.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.361
And they're the kind of letters that you have to answer because

39:23.881 --> 39:34.785
They're people who have just discovered that the last 20 years of their lives hadn't been their fault, I think.

39:34.805 --> 39:39.375
The reason I don't have that with me for you to describe it, by the way, is that somebody's... No.

39:39.777 --> 39:44.645
Well, books have to be read, too.

39:44.665 --> 39:47.129
I think that's pretty important.

39:47.149 --> 39:50.715
You know, you go into these libraries and the books can't be touched.

39:50.735 --> 39:54.221
I mean, they really can't.

39:54.241 --> 39:55.884
But on the other hand, I know I mentioned Roger Strader.

39:55.904 --> 40:06.021
He has books with engravings in them, and they are really reaching a point where, like watercolors, you can only allow them so much time

40:06.862 --> 40:25.034
you know, every year, every ten years in the sunlight because they have books where they are now actually a portion of time because exposure will destroy them.

40:25.055 --> 40:25.716
What about this Grudenberg Bible?

40:25.736 --> 40:26.457
Isn't that something that every time

40:26.842 --> 40:35.834
Is it just someone who's also taking away the life of it?

40:36.194 --> 40:39.038
I don't think the Bible.

40:39.318 --> 40:44.164
The Gutenberg Bible is a great example of where the first was the best.

40:44.185 --> 40:44.325
Really?

40:44.365 --> 40:45.206
The printing is magnificent.

40:45.226 --> 40:47.228
It's acid-free paper.

40:47.248 --> 40:48.911
There's no boxing in it.

40:48.931 --> 40:52.095
You look at it and you'd swear it was done yesterday.

40:52.115 --> 40:54.057
Of course, you guys keep a block in a vault.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.259
You swear it was done yesterday?

40:55.279 --> 40:56.140
You've seen Gutenberg Bibles.

40:56.508 --> 40:59.954
They have one of the Library of Congress over here in Ireland.

41:00.776 --> 41:01.296
Yale has one.

41:01.316 --> 41:04.342
No one might laugh.

41:04.362 --> 41:08.349
Well, he actually felt the illuminations.

41:08.369 --> 41:08.429
Oh.

41:08.449 --> 41:08.930
He knows.

41:09.751 --> 41:14.279
He is so wonderful.

41:14.299 --> 41:15.782
This guy's a scholar.
