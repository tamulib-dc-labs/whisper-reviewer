WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:04.985
No problem, I'll just shut this off.

00:05.005 --> 00:05.946
We're now recording.

00:08.088 --> 00:11.131
Thank you for agreeing to see us today, Doctor.

00:11.331 --> 00:20.361
I'm just curious, you mentioned when we came in that this is called a national library in name, but it is really not precisely that.

00:20.381 --> 00:21.502
I wonder what you meant by that.

00:21.742 --> 00:31.472
Yes, because a century ago they decided to give the title of national library to all the libraries of the

00:31.705 --> 00:34.949
ancient independent Italian states.

00:36.330 --> 00:45.100
So in Piedmont, in Turin, in Milan, in Venice.

00:45.981 --> 00:53.810
So there are many national libraries, as many as the ancient states which existed before the Union.

00:53.830 --> 01:00.497
Italy, there are two real national libraries, one in Florence and one in Rome.

01:00.646 --> 01:02.108
So there are national libraries?

01:02.128 --> 01:07.695
These are really national, in the sense that they have the right to have a copy of every book published in Italy.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.177
So they're deposit libraries?

01:09.197 --> 01:10.058
They're deposit libraries.

01:10.519 --> 01:11.961
How about in terms of the collections?

01:12.041 --> 01:17.608
Are they national ones that go beyond the deposit, I mean, like the special collections?

01:17.628 --> 01:24.217
Well, the national libraries, this means in reality state libraries.

01:24.237 --> 01:24.617
I see.

01:24.837 --> 01:28.442
And they should have...

01:29.654 --> 01:58.817
something of every subject but of course it's impossible in modern culture so we try to specialise ourselves a little so in our case we are determined by our history in the sense that we have a lot of precious things of classical culture and in particularly Greek so we go on buying books in the field of philology

01:59.236 --> 02:10.212
Greek and Latin, and humanism, tradition of texts, those kind of things.

02:12.135 --> 02:23.893
And also history, because we have many books concerning the Venetian history, and so we buy all about Venice, all the books related to the Venetian history.

02:24.515 --> 02:25.716
And in general, history.

02:26.237 --> 02:29.380
We don't find medicine, we don't find law.

02:29.940 --> 02:33.663
Of course you find ancient books of law, but not modern.

02:33.884 --> 02:38.608
So it would be impossible to cover the whole range of human knowledge.

02:38.648 --> 02:43.413
So, roughly, what is the size of your holdings?

02:44.413 --> 02:46.055
A little less than a million books.

02:47.036 --> 02:47.717
So it's not much.

02:47.737 --> 02:52.581
If you compare it with the Library of Congress, how many are they?

02:52.882 --> 02:55.766
100 million, so... 117 million, they say.

02:55.786 --> 02:56.807
117 million.

02:56.827 --> 02:59.050
It's not all books.

02:59.591 --> 03:00.853
And it's all of America.

03:00.873 --> 03:11.347
It's not, you know, you have a number of, as you've already pointed out, your specialty here is Venice and Greece, and you have other libraries throughout Italy that have similar specialties.

03:11.367 --> 03:13.589
Yes, a sort of division.

03:14.270 --> 03:18.035
And that more or less represents the Italian character and nation, doesn't it?

03:18.055 --> 03:22.281
I mean, the nation itself is only 120-something years old, so it's not...

03:22.615 --> 03:27.379
That would explain to a great extent why there are so many different... Ah, yes, of course, yes.

03:27.419 --> 03:29.982
The unity is very recent, yes.

03:31.143 --> 03:34.406
When you say a million books, that's printed and manuscripts?

03:34.426 --> 03:34.966
Yes, yes.

03:35.006 --> 03:40.271
The manuscripts are 13,000, and we have 13,000 manuscripts.

03:41.052 --> 03:52.302
For 24,000 editions of the 16th century, Cinque Centine, 2,400

03:52.602 --> 04:01.294
44, 46 Incunabula, and not much else.

04:03.678 --> 04:15.635
If we could talk a little bit, we're very interested in the role of Venice and the fall of Constantinople and the migration of Greek texts and culture here.

04:15.895 --> 04:21.323
This is a very, this library is a repository for a lot of that material, isn't it?

04:21.343 --> 04:22.204
Yes, of course, yes, yes.

04:22.471 --> 04:26.837
No, because we are born from the donation of Bessarion, who was a Greek, as you know.

04:30.383 --> 04:44.363
It is to say that we started, the first idea of a public, of a library belonging to the state and open to the public in Venice was conceived by Petrarch.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.568
Petrarcha.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.469
That's a long time ago.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.672
Long time ago, in 1360.

04:50.753 --> 04:55.200
It was near to do it in 1362.

04:56.481 --> 05:01.689
He proposed to the Venetian Republic a sort of agreement.

05:01.769 --> 05:06.256
He said, I give you my library.

05:06.496 --> 05:11.003
He had the most important library in Europe at the time.

05:12.445 --> 05:19.275
After my death it will become property of the Venetian state.

05:19.508 --> 05:24.577
But even now it would be open to the scholars and so on.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.685
In exchange, you give me a house where I could live for my life.

05:28.725 --> 05:31.510
So the Venetian state accepted.

05:31.550 --> 05:40.065
There was a solemn proto.

05:44.821 --> 05:48.827
This is from inside, so I cannot stop them.

05:48.927 --> 05:55.998
I should make a circular... This is your work, and you're very kind to take the time from this.

05:56.338 --> 06:10.339
Coming back to Petrarch, there was a solemn deliberation on the Great Council of Venice in September 1362, and

06:10.522 --> 06:12.685
Petrarch came to Italy, to Venice.

06:12.705 --> 06:16.531
He stayed here on the river degli Schiavoni for five years.

06:17.232 --> 06:19.736
The house is no longer there, unfortunately.

06:19.756 --> 06:23.001
But the place is, there is another building.

06:23.621 --> 06:25.685
But then he changed his mind.

06:25.705 --> 06:32.715
He went to Padova, carrying his life with him, and he left.

06:32.915 --> 07:00.222
because he was not happy at the beginning, yes, but after the Doge, Chelsea, who was a friend of him, died, the great Chancellor Benintendi, who was another friend of him, died, the new Doge, Marco Corner, was not particularly interested, but mainly the fact was that he hoped to have more success, more followers,

07:00.775 --> 07:08.002
But Venice was not yet prepared to this kind of vision of the world with humanistic.

07:08.022 --> 07:14.088
They were more aristotelic, more interested in science, in medicine.

07:14.728 --> 07:17.911
Petrarch hated the physicians.

07:20.934 --> 07:28.842
So they couldn't... He preferred to go to Padua where the Signore was his friend.

07:29.328 --> 07:31.090
And he stayed back there.

07:31.110 --> 07:39.678
And so this project was not carried on.

07:39.698 --> 07:43.341
It was not definitive.

07:43.361 --> 07:54.191
The person who gave birth to the library was Cardinal Bessarian, who was an extraordinary figure of the humanistic world.

07:54.211 --> 07:58.575
He was born in Trebizond at the beginning of the century.

07:58.775 --> 07:59.976
Which century?

08:00.517 --> 08:05.361
Potrocento, 15th century.

08:05.381 --> 08:06.682
And he was born in Trebizond.

08:06.702 --> 08:09.365
The date is not sure about the beginning of the century.

08:09.865 --> 08:15.891
Then he went to Constantinople, he studied there with scholars.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.494
He was still a great center of culture.

08:20.936 --> 08:27.702
Then he became a monk, a Brazilian monk.

08:28.576 --> 08:37.649
passed some years in Mistra, where there was a great scholar called Gemistos, Plato.

08:38.009 --> 08:43.317
George Gemistos.

08:43.337 --> 08:44.699
I don't know how he was in Greek.

08:44.719 --> 08:46.642
Gemistos, I think.

08:46.662 --> 08:47.182
It's Plato?

08:47.583 --> 08:48.685
Plato.

08:48.785 --> 08:50.067
So not Plato.

08:50.187 --> 08:50.607
Plato.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.149
P-L-A-T-H.

08:53.051 --> 08:58.178
Because he was a sort of surname, because he was a follower of Plato, the ancient.

08:58.428 --> 09:02.712
And so he tried to, gemistos means full.

09:03.773 --> 09:13.544
So he'd take a name with Plato, sort of translation of his name, and also reminded the name of Plato.

09:13.564 --> 09:21.211
And so he's a great, an eccentric and extraordinary figure, a great, great scholar, and he was a pagan.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.854
He was not a believer in any religion.

09:24.335 --> 09:26.697
He was a follower of real ancient philosophy.

09:26.980 --> 09:34.347
And Bessarion stayed there for some years, and he became familiar with the culture of ancient Greece.

09:37.250 --> 09:44.217
He knew very well astronomy, all sciences, and also the classical literature.

09:44.897 --> 09:46.319
Then he became Archbishop.

09:46.359 --> 09:52.785
He came to Italy in 1438.

09:53.727 --> 10:07.186
in order to participate to the council, the ecumenical council of Ferrara, Firenze, because they wanted to try to unite the two churches, the Greek and the Latin.

10:07.206 --> 10:22.367
So he came here and he passed through Venice going to Ferrara and in this moment started a great friendship with many figures of the Venetian aristocracy and clergy.

10:23.225 --> 10:27.410
And then he went to Ferrara to Florence.

10:28.391 --> 10:34.018
He was the leader of the group who was in favor of the Union.

10:34.919 --> 10:45.152
So he became the most important figure in this group of Greek.

10:45.953 --> 10:51.039
And there were many bishops, archbishops and monks and so on.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.641
Plato, Plato,

10:52.992 --> 11:18.612
And then the Union was proclaimed in Florence, and the Stalinists were very happy, but unfortunately the Greeks did not accept it, because they found it probably, it has risen probably, they found it was a sort of trick made by the West in order to limit the liberty of the East.

11:20.009 --> 11:27.556
The Emperor wanted it very strongly because he wanted to have allies against the Turks that were surrounding the city.

11:27.576 --> 11:33.022
But the Greeks just said that this was not a solution.

11:33.042 --> 11:37.326
And so, Vestalian remained in Rome.

11:37.366 --> 11:41.910
He went back to Constantinople, seeing the atmosphere against the Union.

11:41.970 --> 11:44.273
He preferred to come back to Rome.

11:44.293 --> 11:45.394
He became a cardinal.

11:46.235 --> 11:48.717
And then he devoted his life to

11:49.186 --> 12:02.241
do all what he could to help his countrymen in Greece, organizing leagues against the Turks and so on, but with no success because of course he fell and so on.

12:02.261 --> 12:13.675
But what he did in fact was to transform his private library into the Greek national library in some sense.

12:13.715 --> 12:18.400
He wanted to buy or to have copied

12:18.920 --> 12:22.803
for what he could find of the Greek ancient culture.

12:22.823 --> 12:33.153
Not particularly the religious books, because there were many, but books which were in danger to be destroyed were the classical books, the ancient books.

12:33.873 --> 12:46.885
And so he created a very important library, about a thousand books for the Epochism Arch, let's say six

12:47.506 --> 12:49.509
600 Greeks and the remaining Latin.

12:49.749 --> 13:04.228
And then, at the end of his life, he decided to give it to Venice because he thought it was the most proper place where these books would be kept, would be preserved.

13:04.649 --> 13:07.592
And also there were many Greeks who came to Venice.

13:07.612 --> 13:10.356
It was in Padova, the center of Greek culture.

13:11.157 --> 13:15.483
Many friends of him had great positions in the government.

13:15.903 --> 13:17.125
So he found that the

13:17.476 --> 13:21.841
best place where to put his treasury was Venice.

13:22.081 --> 13:33.153
And also there was a reason that Venice was the only European power who was effectively fighting against the Turks.

13:34.574 --> 13:37.938
And he came here the first time in 1438.

13:41.081 --> 13:44.665
Then he came back probably another time

13:44.965 --> 13:45.686
in 1460.

13:45.786 --> 13:50.392
Then he stayed for more than one year in 1463-64.

13:51.853 --> 14:00.064
And then he made his donation in 1468.

14:00.184 --> 14:13.420
The books arrived a year later, but he kept some books for himself because he was still active in culture and politics and so on.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.535
And the remaining part right when he died in 72.

14:19.577 --> 14:22.421
And was this called, what was this library called?

14:22.441 --> 14:23.482
Was it named after him?

14:24.063 --> 14:31.031
No, he gave it to Venice, to the Venetian state, to St.

14:31.071 --> 14:31.732
Marco.

14:32.193 --> 14:32.373
St.

14:32.393 --> 14:36.237
Marco was a symbol of the Venetian state, so he gave it to St.

14:36.277 --> 14:42.465
Marco in order to be governed by the procurators of St.

14:42.525 --> 14:44.267
Marco, who were a great

14:44.973 --> 14:49.277
had a very important position in the state.

14:49.317 --> 14:57.986
They were the people who administered the wealth of the church.

14:58.046 --> 15:05.393
There were also great political figures.

15:05.473 --> 15:12.060
They came after the Doge, immediately after the Doge, in the pyramid of the Phoenician state.

15:12.817 --> 15:41.490
it was in fact a donation to Venice to the Venetian public and in exchange Venice accepted the gift and promised to build a proper space for the library and this required a long time because they started only in 1527 and before the books were kept in the Ducal Palace in a room over here and

15:42.247 --> 15:51.919
The idea was to create a Venetian library, a library of the state, open to scholars, like Petrarch.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.527
It was the ancient dream of Petrarch, who was made effective by the Sarian.

15:58.448 --> 16:06.698
Avanti.

16:06.718 --> 16:09.222
The books went to Florence, I think, finally, didn't they?

16:09.242 --> 16:10.363
Where did Petrarch's

16:10.647 --> 16:25.024
They are still finding some of the books of his library in the most remote countries.

16:25.104 --> 16:26.605
He should have given them here.

16:26.966 --> 16:28.428
It was better.

16:28.448 --> 16:29.028
It's a pity.

16:29.489 --> 16:39.220
Because when he died, part of the library was bought by the Signore di Padova.

16:39.402 --> 16:41.965
the Carraresi, the family of Carraresi.

16:41.985 --> 16:46.631
Then Pada was conquered by Visconti, who carried the library to Milan.

16:46.651 --> 16:54.580
Then Milan was conquered by the French, who takes part of it to France, partly dispersed the collection.

16:55.080 --> 16:59.025
And so they are everywhere now, unfortunately.

16:59.065 --> 17:02.870
So in 1527, where was the building that was built for the books?

17:02.990 --> 17:03.751
This building here?

17:03.791 --> 17:04.692
No, this is the Mint.

17:05.272 --> 17:06.574
We are now in the Mint.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.166
The nearby.

17:08.206 --> 17:11.129
Well, we're going to see it in a minute.

17:11.149 --> 17:13.491
The one which is on the piazza, you see.

17:13.511 --> 17:22.359
On the piazza, in front of the Ducal Palace, that is this classical building called, born as a library.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.581
What does Marciana mean?

17:24.922 --> 17:25.262
Of St.

17:25.282 --> 17:25.582
Mark.

17:25.602 --> 17:25.883
Of St.

17:25.903 --> 17:26.864
Mark.

17:26.884 --> 17:28.625
So Biblioteca Nacional of St.

17:28.665 --> 17:28.966
Mark.

17:28.986 --> 17:30.827
Of St.

17:30.847 --> 17:31.047
Mark, yes.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.810
It was the name, Marciana is the adjective for

17:34.381 --> 17:37.124
which corresponds to St.

17:37.145 --> 17:37.825
Mark.

17:39.047 --> 17:45.215
Under the Venetian Republic it was called Liberia di San Marco or Publica Libreria, Public Library.

17:45.235 --> 17:48.119
So the most common way to call it was Public Library.

17:48.139 --> 17:52.444
Did the Venetians have their own dialect or did they all speak the same language?

17:52.464 --> 17:53.345
Of course they have.

17:53.585 --> 17:55.688
They still have their own dialect.

17:56.089 --> 17:57.450
They do.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.032
Yes.

17:59.052 --> 18:04.219
But it's rather complicated because they spoke in normal life

18:04.638 --> 18:06.140
Of course, they spoke Venetian.

18:07.763 --> 18:19.642
In the Council, they spoke a sort of a nobler Venetian, similar to the Italian, more similar to the ideal Italian.

18:20.824 --> 18:31.742
So there was always a bit complicated, because we didn't have a national language for the whole of Italy, but still the great writers like Dante,

18:32.009 --> 18:35.094
Petrarca Boccaccio wrote in Florentine.

18:35.976 --> 18:49.258
So if a person wanted to be cultivated, he spoke a sort of nobler dialect, similar to, very near to Florentine.

18:49.643 --> 18:50.985
Could they understand each other?

18:51.005 --> 18:56.733
I mean, were the languages close enough to each other that they could... Not much.

18:58.196 --> 18:58.336
Really?

18:58.356 --> 19:05.466
Even now, if you go to... For instance, if you go in Lombardy, you don't understand a word of the dialect.

19:05.486 --> 19:06.988
Absolutely.

19:07.008 --> 19:18.385
Not to speak for... about Sicily or... In fact, when Visconti, a great director of... film director of ours, made a film called La Terra Trema,

19:18.787 --> 19:36.751
the earth trembles, and it was about Sicily, the life of Sicilians, in particular of the fishermen, poor fishermen, which was spoken in Sicily, but with under titles, because nobody would.

19:36.771 --> 19:39.014
There must be a good biography of this Viserion.

19:39.355 --> 19:40.997
I'm sure I'll be able to find

19:41.315 --> 19:42.736
Oh, well, there are plenty.

19:42.897 --> 19:44.238
A very famous person.

19:44.258 --> 19:46.721
It's a wonderful story.

19:46.741 --> 19:47.682
Now, was he Greek?

19:47.922 --> 19:49.383
Did you say he was Greek?

19:49.404 --> 19:51.025
Was he Orthodox?

19:51.366 --> 19:53.027
Did he become Catholic?

19:53.748 --> 19:58.213
Yes, because he made it a union, a union of churches.

19:58.233 --> 20:03.218
But when the Greeks didn't accept it, he stayed... He remained unionistic.

20:04.179 --> 20:06.041
Very interesting.

20:06.261 --> 20:07.963
Very, very important.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.092
Are these your predecessors up here?

20:10.612 --> 20:12.435
Some are predecessors.

20:12.455 --> 20:14.036
This is Bessarian.

20:14.056 --> 20:15.698
Oh, that's Bessarian.

20:15.718 --> 20:19.483
This is a copy of the original, which is in the Academia.

20:20.664 --> 20:21.825
The portrait in the Academia.

20:21.845 --> 20:25.830
So if I want to get a picture of him to use in my book, I contact the Academia.

20:26.190 --> 20:28.393
But I want to purchase a picture with him.

20:28.413 --> 20:31.997
Yes, perhaps, yes.

20:32.017 --> 20:37.123
But also about him, there are plenty of portraits.

20:38.217 --> 20:44.343
It's not so simple because there are portraits in Vienna, there are portraits in... There are many.

20:44.363 --> 20:44.783
There are many.

20:45.504 --> 20:46.905
The one in the middle you're pointing to?

20:46.925 --> 20:57.456
Yes, yes, because here in his hands he has a precious reliquary which is still preserved in the Accademia.

20:57.476 --> 20:57.996
It's still there.

20:58.176 --> 21:01.139
Luckily it has not been robbed by any of all.

21:01.640 --> 21:08.106
Yes, has there been much loss here through... In the library, not much.

21:08.727 --> 21:26.430
because Napoleon took 470 books, but he gave them back, except with some exception, because when he fell, the Emperor of Austria wanted them back, and the French had to give them.

21:27.211 --> 21:37.384
Some were changed in other books of less value, but this is not so important, because for the manuscript they came.

21:37.769 --> 21:46.900
What do you consider, of course, I'm sure it's all your family, all of the million books, but what do you consider the most precious?

21:48.182 --> 21:54.489
Without any doubt, the collection of Bessarion, the books, the Greek books given by Bessarion.

21:54.509 --> 22:04.401
In particularly, that is, for instance, the so-called Homer A, Homerus Velitus A, number one, which is

22:04.718 --> 22:16.693
The most important manuscript of the Iliad, for instance, which is a 10th century book with an extremely important commentary, for instance.

22:16.713 --> 22:25.505
Homerus A. Homerus Venetus A. Is that the earliest surviving text of Homer, do you think?

22:26.106 --> 22:32.734
Perhaps there are one which is a little older, but here, what is the...

22:33.187 --> 22:37.633
Homer survives in thousands of manuscripts.

22:38.534 --> 22:55.557
This is particularly important for the commentary because all around and in the middle there is a lot of commentaries which are the sort of resume of the summary of books concerning Homer which are now lost.

22:55.998 --> 23:01.405
The Byzantine scholar had at his disposal a lot of books which after disappeared.

23:01.790 --> 23:10.383
And so the great part of what the Greeks thought about Homer is preserved in this book.

23:10.403 --> 23:11.825
That's wonderful.

23:11.845 --> 23:26.728
For instance, we have the Planoidean anthology, which is the Greek epigrams for short poems survive in two manuscripts.

23:26.748 --> 23:29.552
One is the Palatine anthology,

23:30.511 --> 23:37.858
and the Planudean anthology, which is ours, made by a monk called Planudes in the year 1300.

23:38.539 --> 23:41.522
So the two books together, they're not equal.

23:41.542 --> 23:49.950
There are two anthologies made by two different persons, and so they cover all what remains of these short Greek poems.

23:50.351 --> 23:52.153
And these again were Cardinal Vesarian?

23:52.173 --> 23:53.214
Again Cardinal Vesarian.

23:54.155 --> 23:56.637
Cardinal Vesarian bought, for instance,

23:57.022 --> 24:04.873
the most ancient and precious manuscript of Hippocrates, the great physician, 10th century.

24:04.913 --> 24:26.202
And we have a manuscript, the two most ancient and in practice, the whole of Phocios, who was a great scholar of the 9th century, beginning of 10th, who...

24:26.553 --> 24:39.873
made a famous book called The Library of Mirio Biblon who made the summary of a hundred or more books.

24:41.215 --> 24:52.712
Many of these books are lost and so they remain only in the summary and made by this patriarch who also has transcribed some

24:53.317 --> 24:54.358
part of these books.

24:54.458 --> 25:04.130
And so many, many books remain in these, in this compilation of thoughts.

25:04.531 --> 25:08.916
And there are, what else, many, many other things of this quality.

25:09.156 --> 25:17.907
But these are links with the ancient culture which would have been lost entirely if Cardinal Busserian had not had the foresight to gather them up

25:18.157 --> 25:18.918
and bring them here.

25:19.199 --> 25:19.840
Yes.

25:20.040 --> 25:27.072
Perhaps the Lost would not have been so complete as it was thought at this moment, because many other things came out.

25:27.673 --> 25:33.323
And then in some cases, yes, in some cases, for instance, Athenaeus.

25:33.764 --> 25:43.641
Athenaeus is a book that I think remains only in this copy of Bessarion, which was a very scholarly book concerning

25:43.891 --> 26:01.357
a discussion made by some scholars in the second century after Christ, which remains in practice in this copy much later, but of the 10th century, bought by Vassarion.

26:01.457 --> 26:03.460
There are many, many other things.

26:03.480 --> 26:11.873
Just to say, without his collections, certainly the knowledge we have about the Greek culture would be much less extended.

26:12.157 --> 26:13.599
That was Athenaeus, you could say?

26:13.619 --> 26:16.503
Athenaeus, yes.

26:16.523 --> 26:18.126
And all these books are here in this building?

26:18.546 --> 26:19.287
Yes, yes.

26:19.728 --> 26:22.612
Will you be able to show us some of them?

26:22.632 --> 26:26.238
Yes, some of them, yes, yes.

26:26.258 --> 26:27.379
It's fascinating, isn't it?

26:28.381 --> 26:29.402
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

26:31.185 --> 26:40.138
I thought you should... But perhaps in the book written by Stichos you'll find, because Stichos made another book

26:40.490 --> 26:46.459
which, unfortunately, is now borrowed by a person of mine.

26:46.479 --> 26:53.769
You can find it in about Greek libraries in the world, or big libraries, or ancient libraries.

26:53.990 --> 26:58.236
And there is a chapter concerning the Vassalian's library.

26:59.518 --> 26:59.898
Stikos.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.781
I'm going to contact him with this.

27:02.101 --> 27:04.124
Stikos is your man.

27:06.027 --> 27:07.089
Is he a professor, a teacher?

27:07.109 --> 27:08.050
No, he is a...

27:08.333 --> 27:13.121
A rich gentleman whose pleasure is to collect books.

27:13.141 --> 27:14.102
He's a collector.

27:14.122 --> 27:17.428
So if I send him a copy of my book... He will be delighted.

27:18.990 --> 27:19.250
That's great.

27:19.270 --> 27:35.877
I don't want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to... If you want to show you the... If you want to show you the... The rooms

27:36.903 --> 27:39.407
Can we leave, should we leave our things here?

27:40.368 --> 27:41.249
Or should we take them with us?

27:41.510 --> 27:43.272
Perhaps it's better to wear.

27:43.433 --> 27:43.713
Okay.

27:45.015 --> 27:51.124
Okay.

27:52.466 --> 27:58.896
Okay.

28:00.298 --> 28:01.780
Okay.

28:09.303 --> 28:23.778
What was Cardinal Busserian's first name?

28:23.878 --> 28:32.867
It's a very recent discovery that nobody knew, and now I've maybe found it.

28:32.887 --> 28:34.509
It was Basilio.

28:34.929 --> 28:38.753
Basilio, they say.

28:47.204 --> 28:51.230
We are in the stacks now.

28:51.610 --> 28:55.295
I'm sorry.

28:55.316 --> 28:55.596
Oh, thank you.

28:55.616 --> 28:55.816
I'm sorry.

28:55.836 --> 28:56.297
Oh, my.

28:56.958 --> 28:57.459
This is thrilling.

29:03.647 --> 29:07.853
I've got goose pimples.

29:07.873 --> 29:13.121
These are mainly the silent books.

29:13.141 --> 29:16.806
Unfortunately, they have been re-bound in the .

29:17.056 --> 29:26.549
These are the thousand books that he gave.

29:26.589 --> 29:35.821
Look at some of these, Connie.

29:35.841 --> 29:43.992
They are not particularly splendid to look at, but they are very precious.

29:45.119 --> 29:50.083
Can you describe what you're holding in your hands, this particular book?

29:50.103 --> 29:52.886
Well, let's find something more.

30:04.456 --> 30:05.277
This is exciting.

30:06.318 --> 30:06.979
Syntagma.

30:07.019 --> 30:08.720
What is Syntagma?

30:08.740 --> 30:09.781
Astronomia.

30:10.742 --> 30:11.643
Astronomy.

30:12.183 --> 30:15.126
Astronomy.

30:15.427 --> 30:18.572
And that's all in Greek, too?

30:18.833 --> 30:19.915
They're all in Greek.

30:23.180 --> 30:27.127
That's what's so important, isn't it?

30:27.307 --> 30:28.810
So that's your label.

30:29.351 --> 30:32.035
This is my label.

30:46.274 --> 30:48.397
You said these were 19th century bindings, or 18th?

30:48.417 --> 30:51.080
18th, yeah, they look more than 18th, yeah.

30:58.929 --> 31:05.597
Is this, would you call this your rare book vault, or does this have a name, this room?

31:05.618 --> 31:06.499
No name.

31:06.519 --> 31:09.482
No name.

31:09.502 --> 31:11.565
That's a folio-sized book on vellum.

31:12.486 --> 31:13.107
Look at that.

31:13.207 --> 31:15.910
This is Homer A. That's Homer A.

31:16.278 --> 31:18.200
Where are the emendations?

31:18.881 --> 31:19.361
Look at those.

31:20.243 --> 31:22.265
These first pages are a little later.

31:22.305 --> 31:25.428
They were made two centuries after.

31:26.590 --> 31:32.476
These illustrations are probably made in southern Italy.

31:32.496 --> 31:33.017
We don't know.

31:33.437 --> 31:34.178
Oh, they're beautiful.

31:34.459 --> 31:41.847
It's a sort of paraphrases of the poem made by Nonno.

31:42.383 --> 31:44.366
He's eating a man?

31:44.746 --> 31:47.670
Yes, this is a zodiac symbol.

31:47.751 --> 31:51.316
I'm sorry, once again, what was that?

31:51.336 --> 31:53.359
Zacharias?

31:53.419 --> 31:55.822
Now, these are Greek or Italian illustrations?

31:56.783 --> 31:58.225
No, it's all Greek.

31:58.245 --> 32:06.537
The illustrations of the miniatures are perhaps made in southern Italy, but we don't know whether they are strange or little.

32:06.577 --> 32:08.560
Not Greek, not of the capital.

32:09.822 --> 32:12.005
But they're a thousand years old, perhaps, right?

32:12.045 --> 32:17.433
No, they are of the 12th century.

32:17.454 --> 32:19.396
The illustrations, but the text is a thousand.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.139
The text is a thousand years old.

32:21.159 --> 32:21.940
It's the 10th century.

32:22.501 --> 32:24.144
Look at that.

32:24.164 --> 32:25.666
Look at that.

32:25.686 --> 32:28.751
Can you see the commentary, as I told you?

32:30.653 --> 32:31.395
A thousand years.

32:31.775 --> 32:35.020
Yeah, that's what you were saying.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.913
So this was commentary on Homer.

32:36.953 --> 32:39.977
This was literary criticism of the 10th century.

32:41.399 --> 32:41.980
Not quite.

32:42.360 --> 32:54.516
It's also of the 10th century, but also there is a sort of summary of what other scholars had said before.

32:54.576 --> 33:03.488
So there is some original elaboration, but also there is a lot of information

33:03.721 --> 33:09.669
It's very important.

33:09.729 --> 33:20.684
It's very important that we don't have the original works of the many of the Alexandrian school, these great scholars.

33:20.724 --> 33:22.887
The Alexandrian school, yes.

33:22.907 --> 33:32.901
And they still have, for instance, in some of these verses, these signs, these symbols which were invented by the Alexandrians.

33:33.455 --> 33:44.467
the Alexandrians, the Obelos, this means for instance, this verse is not, in my opinion, is not by Homer.

33:44.967 --> 34:00.964
To be very synthetic, instead of repeating these ideas, they made a sign, there is a sort of six or seven symbols, which remain found in this particular manuscripts and in some

34:01.484 --> 34:06.570
leaves or papyrus.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.111
They knew that they existed.

34:08.131 --> 34:13.918
They are visible only in here and in some fragments.

34:14.699 --> 34:15.620
Is this your specialty?

34:16.120 --> 34:17.061
No.

34:17.081 --> 34:20.565
No, I would like it.

34:20.585 --> 34:21.846
This is a beautiful library.

34:24.049 --> 34:25.210
We are in the mint now.

34:25.530 --> 34:26.892
Is that Dante over there?

34:27.913 --> 34:28.774
It's Pichak.

34:30.290 --> 34:31.792
It's a beautiful furniture.

34:32.913 --> 34:33.835
Look at holding the book.

34:33.895 --> 34:34.836
That is so wonderful.

34:40.643 --> 34:46.090
Do they sell any books here with background or informational things that I could purchase, do you think?

34:47.532 --> 34:50.356
Nothing in the library, per se, that you have any materials.

34:52.999 --> 34:53.981
I wanted to show us.

34:54.081 --> 34:57.445
Connie, do you want to show us something?

34:58.032 --> 35:21.171
the prince started in his years probably it came to Italy because he he was a person who

35:22.315 --> 35:28.844
This is written by his hand.

35:29.244 --> 35:29.845
Now whose hand?

35:30.226 --> 35:31.968
That's Bessarian's hand.

35:32.769 --> 35:37.856
He wrote the position of the book.

35:37.896 --> 35:48.070
The position you mean in the library?

35:48.090 --> 35:51.715
So he was telling you, so he had his own

35:52.707 --> 36:08.308
And what was that book you were holding?

36:09.109 --> 36:09.910
That particular book?

36:15.959 --> 36:20.605
Well, look at that.

36:21.698 --> 36:34.410
That was the book you were telling us about.

36:34.511 --> 36:40.016
Look at the decorations.

36:41.337 --> 36:45.802
That's the cardinal's coat of arms?

36:46.402 --> 36:46.803
Yes.

36:46.883 --> 36:50.406
So this was illuminated for him?

36:50.757 --> 36:55.603
engaged artists to decorate his books, do you think?

36:55.623 --> 37:04.715
Some, some books are decorated, but he's not particularly interested in decoration, because we want to discuss things, but still some of them.

37:04.735 --> 37:18.452
But what is interesting is that this is a printed book, you see, one of the first printed books in Italy, and these two printers who were German,

37:19.512 --> 37:31.264
Feinheim and Pannard came to Rome in, to Italy in 1465 and to Rome.

37:31.444 --> 37:31.945
Massimo.

37:34.007 --> 37:37.070
And they set up their press in Palazzo Massimo, which we visited.

37:37.210 --> 37:37.350
Yes.

37:38.151 --> 37:41.014
And there it is right there, Massimo.

37:41.214 --> 37:42.435
Massimo.

37:42.455 --> 37:43.616
And what is the date on that?

37:46.760 --> 37:49.182
Dung, 69.

37:50.647 --> 37:51.128
1469.

37:51.408 --> 37:54.591
Beautifully printed.

37:54.832 --> 37:55.613
It's very clear.

37:55.893 --> 37:56.654
Very clear.

37:56.974 --> 37:59.917
The paper is absolutely extraordinary.

38:00.077 --> 38:00.678
This is vellum.

38:00.978 --> 38:01.960
That's vellum.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.663
That's a beautiful vellum, isn't it?

38:04.683 --> 38:07.185
The condition of the book is wonderful.

38:07.666 --> 38:09.348
Wonderful.

38:09.368 --> 38:12.651
And I wonder where the Cardinal got that, you know?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.133
He got that here in Italy, obviously.

38:14.153 --> 38:17.056
He must have acquired it when it was issued, do you think?

38:17.737 --> 38:20.400
Of course, yes, because these printers were his

38:20.633 --> 38:23.075
He brought them here.

38:23.095 --> 38:24.176
He brought them here, that's right.

38:24.277 --> 38:27.560
He brought them here.

38:27.580 --> 38:30.983
So probably the first copy was written.

38:31.063 --> 38:34.787
You think this could possibly be one of the first books printed in Italy?

38:35.187 --> 38:38.770
Not quite, because they have already started.

38:38.790 --> 38:46.658
The first is made in Subiaco in 1965.

38:49.102 --> 38:51.786
Then they moved to Rome in 68.

38:52.607 --> 38:56.032
This is one of the first books printed in Rome.

38:59.496 --> 39:04.724
And the title again, just so I'm sure we're talking about, what do you call this book?

39:04.744 --> 39:06.446
What is with the cardinals?

39:08.609 --> 39:09.851
Apuleius.

39:10.091 --> 39:10.672
Apuleius.

39:10.872 --> 39:17.041
Italian Latin, Apuleius, Madaurensis, Madaurensis, Metamorphosis.

39:17.161 --> 39:18.703
Oh, Metamorphosis, okay, good.

39:19.105 --> 39:19.806
I can find that.

39:20.707 --> 39:23.571
And what number is this in the library so I can check it against the catalog?

39:28.558 --> 39:32.664
I mean , which means .

39:35.087 --> 39:37.350
But the catalog number for the library, I think.

39:37.370 --> 39:38.372
Ah, well, the catalog number.

39:38.392 --> 39:40.194
No, for your catalog number.

39:40.214 --> 39:42.818
Yes, this is the number.

39:46.628 --> 39:53.476
Now I can check it against the catalog.

40:04.929 --> 40:12.298
She loves the crest of a cardinal, his coat of arms.

40:15.822 --> 40:40.996
It's a different world if that church is united.

40:41.016 --> 40:42.298
I think also the Western health groups have been more effective.

40:42.318 --> 40:43.960
They tried to do something in Western, but then there was a great battle in Barna.

40:43.981 --> 40:44.361
There were problems

40:45.067 --> 40:52.176
It was a defeat for the West, so they were no longer much willing to help them.

40:52.196 --> 41:08.577
Because the temple and boy government Cesarino was killed, I think that time they were killed, and the birds were strong fighters.

41:08.677 --> 41:09.218
And Venisa had to...

41:10.565 --> 41:20.740
When the father came to Venice in 1463, he came also to persuade Venice to engage herself against the Turks.

41:20.860 --> 41:25.647
And Venice decided to start a war in 17 years.

41:25.907 --> 41:26.708
Really?

41:27.410 --> 41:36.423
Are you from Venice?

41:36.443 --> 41:37.725
Yes.

41:37.825 --> 41:38.766
He's Venetian.

41:55.553 --> 42:18.363
Can we take some of these?

42:18.383 --> 42:23.350
These are the statues

42:23.819 --> 42:31.009
given to the Renaissance Republic by Patriarch Grimani in 1587.

42:33.553 --> 42:42.826
Originally kept in this room.

42:43.627 --> 42:49.776
And what is it?

42:50.245 --> 42:51.827
What do we call this building?

42:51.867 --> 42:52.829
What is the name of this?

42:52.849 --> 42:53.470
Libreria.

42:53.490 --> 42:55.112
Libreria Sansoviniana.

42:55.132 --> 42:57.615
I can say because Sansovino made it so they're great.

42:58.076 --> 43:02.402
And it's right next door to, so it's still very close to where they were originally, the books.

43:02.643 --> 43:04.105
Yes.

43:04.125 --> 43:06.989
Those globes are magnificent too.

43:07.009 --> 43:08.751
Made by Coronelli.

43:08.771 --> 43:12.817
And you see on the walls it has Tintoretto.

43:13.178 --> 43:13.778
Tintoretto.

43:14.019 --> 43:17.704
So I'm just trying to, I mean, four kilometers of these two.

43:18.747 --> 43:33.384
In the last series of the... ...the music, arithmetica and honor.

43:35.266 --> 43:47.100
They all belong to the same period in the mid-15th century, with these two exceptions, Straussi and Padovanino, which were made in...

43:47.789 --> 43:53.235
1635, because the water had damaged the tools, which existed before.

43:54.456 --> 43:58.921
I notice that scholarship is present in all of these murals here, pretty much.

43:59.141 --> 44:01.203
There's book, there are books, books.

44:01.324 --> 44:05.228
No, the books were kept probably in things like these.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.709
No, but I mean in the paintings.

44:06.990 --> 44:08.031
Ah, in the paintings.

44:08.051 --> 44:09.072
That's right.

44:11.775 --> 44:12.936
This is magnificent.

44:13.422 --> 44:16.185
This is an exhibition, not ours.

44:16.245 --> 44:17.547
It's textiles mainly.

44:17.567 --> 44:21.010
These textiles will go away soon.

44:21.030 --> 44:23.894
And then we used to have an exhibition from the library here.

44:23.954 --> 44:29.440
We had sometimes exhibitions.

44:29.460 --> 44:34.385
So this was the room that was built for the Cardinal's books.

44:34.405 --> 44:37.448
They did a very noble job, didn't they?

44:37.909 --> 44:41.573
They built a beautiful building for them.

44:42.194 --> 44:43.336
Late as well.

44:43.356 --> 44:46.681
Now these globes are date from when?

44:47.101 --> 44:48.924
Coronelli.

44:48.944 --> 44:57.858
1688, okay, so they knew about the... But look, they have California as an island.

44:58.939 --> 45:03.366
Ah, that's true.

45:03.386 --> 45:10.337
Look at this, honey.

45:10.357 --> 45:11.138
You don't ever get a lake yet?

45:13.092 --> 45:13.793
Oh, my!

45:14.333 --> 45:18.438
And what is this, doctor?

45:18.758 --> 45:23.543
There's up the town, you know?

45:23.623 --> 45:26.507
He's going in there.

45:27.388 --> 45:29.149
Okay, okay.

45:29.170 --> 45:30.531
But that's the mapamundo.

45:31.232 --> 45:36.097
Mapamundo.

45:37.559 --> 45:41.563
Diframabro.

45:43.585 --> 45:44.226
1459.

45:44.466 --> 45:47.009
I notice it's heading east.

45:47.069 --> 45:48.311
The east is to the top.

45:48.351 --> 45:49.833
Jerusalem would be at the center.

45:54.559 --> 45:55.080
It's huge.

45:55.700 --> 45:56.541
The south is there.

45:56.822 --> 45:57.543
There's no.

45:58.844 --> 46:04.752
So you see Italy, Italy, Spain, Greece.

46:04.892 --> 46:12.782
It's magnificent.

46:13.758 --> 46:21.267
Oh, it's upside down.

46:21.287 --> 46:23.169
That's 1459.

46:23.209 --> 46:27.594
That's 40 years before Columbus.

46:27.675 --> 46:28.295
That's wonderful.

46:28.736 --> 46:37.386
That's great.

46:54.528 --> 46:56.251
How long have you been at this library?

46:56.832 --> 47:13.137
Twenty years.

47:13.157 --> 47:18.024
Twenty.

47:18.225 --> 47:22.932
Excuse me.

47:23.485 --> 47:25.648
So this right here is the library.

47:26.469 --> 47:27.671
This is the library.

47:27.951 --> 47:29.313
I mean, right here is the library.

47:29.553 --> 47:31.957
Here is nothing.

47:32.177 --> 47:33.879
Here is empty.

47:33.899 --> 47:36.282
Now it's the library.

47:36.303 --> 47:48.379
And this is the second floor.

47:52.325 --> 48:00.299
You're very, very generous with your times.

48:01.160 --> 48:16.206
I don't think we have to take a... Well, if I can do something else...

48:16.642 --> 48:23.871
I think this is wonderful.

48:24.492 --> 48:26.454
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the visit.

48:27.055 --> 48:27.916
Thank you so much.

48:27.936 --> 48:28.737
And I'll be in touch.

48:29.057 --> 48:30.319
And I'll make sure you get a copy.

48:30.379 --> 48:31.860
Thank you for the book.

48:31.881 --> 48:32.181
Thank you.

48:32.381 --> 48:33.823
And I'll make sure you get the new one, too.

48:34.464 --> 48:35.825
I'll send you a copy of the new book.

48:36.266 --> 48:42.193
Thank you.

48:47.405 --> 48:49.382
I'm glad we came over early, you know?
