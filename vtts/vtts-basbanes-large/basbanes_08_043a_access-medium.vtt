WEBVTT

00:03.811 --> 00:05.714
We're rolling.

00:05.734 --> 00:07.076
Great books, Mary Parr.

00:07.937 --> 00:10.000
I really started all the notes I had.

00:10.020 --> 00:10.661
Oh, so great.

00:10.942 --> 00:13.686
Tell me a bit about writing a memoir of a little girl.

00:13.806 --> 00:17.712
Let me also say, last summer, I do interviews with P.W.

00:17.732 --> 00:17.932
too.

00:18.513 --> 00:21.918
And I do the Tobias Wolfe piece with P.W.

00:22.018 --> 00:22.699
Uh-huh.

00:22.819 --> 00:24.402
Yeah, well, actually, I didn't see it.

00:24.442 --> 00:27.867
I never get P.W., but Toby's my old friend and neighbor.

00:27.927 --> 00:32.113
Yeah, but it's interesting that I think two of the finest memoirs I can think of growing up are

00:32.448 --> 00:35.331
written by Sarah Fusen.

00:35.351 --> 00:36.433
Sarah Fusen.

00:36.453 --> 00:36.933
I could say it.

00:37.374 --> 00:40.577
You know, the weird thing is I actually live in his old house.

00:40.938 --> 00:41.418
Is that right?

00:41.458 --> 00:46.845
But I've also known him for 18 years, and I knew his brother when he wrote that memoir about their daddy.

00:47.586 --> 00:47.886
Which is good.

00:47.906 --> 00:49.648
The Duke of Deception, which I really liked.

00:50.249 --> 00:59.640
I've always liked the form, and I think I cultivated... I mean, you know, the myth is that these things happen through nepotism.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.662
I think it's much more that you...

01:02.198 --> 01:05.923
If you're really interested in a certain kind of writing, you seek out the people who do it.

01:06.323 --> 01:07.285
Now, what's the myth?

01:07.305 --> 01:08.306
What happens to an epitome?

01:08.326 --> 01:08.867
Oh, I don't know.

01:08.967 --> 01:13.853
You know, that there's some connection other than, that there's some evil connection.

01:13.893 --> 01:18.419
But it's really just, I remember, I mean, I always, Toby was always a great writer.

01:18.439 --> 01:21.162
I mean, even before he wrote This Boy's Life, he was a great short story writer.

01:21.182 --> 01:21.803
Oh, it's a short story.

01:21.823 --> 01:24.427
Oh, yeah.

01:24.447 --> 01:27.010
But he had, I mean, he had nothing to do with my getting hired.

01:27.030 --> 01:30.214
He's not even, I'm hired as a poet, and he's a proser, so...

01:30.683 --> 01:31.865
Uh-huh.

01:32.005 --> 01:32.926
It's all lost on you.

01:33.346 --> 01:34.128
No, it's not lost.

01:34.188 --> 01:35.870
I just think it's a stupid argument.

01:35.890 --> 01:36.631
Yeah, it is.

01:36.651 --> 01:38.754
If you teach the course and the right to.

01:38.774 --> 01:39.394
Yeah, yeah.

01:39.515 --> 01:41.637
I mean, you certainly have the skill to write.

01:42.979 --> 01:47.265
The decision to write, though, did Toby influence your decision at all to write about... No.

01:48.246 --> 01:52.251
No, no, but I mean, certainly his book did.

01:52.271 --> 01:55.035
I mean, the... It's working.

01:55.055 --> 01:55.155
Okay.

01:55.490 --> 02:03.700
The other one wasn't out yet, obviously, but I remember reading that book, and I hadn't seen him in a long time, seven or eight years, and I read him a fan letter.

02:04.802 --> 02:13.393
And I had tried to write this book as a novel, and he sent me back a wonderful little paragraph of advice.

02:14.354 --> 02:16.176
And this was before I was at Syracuse.

02:16.216 --> 02:20.081
I was actually at the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe at the time as a poet.

02:20.802 --> 02:22.324
Can somebody bring us something to drink?

02:22.473 --> 02:26.298
We would kill for something to drink.

02:26.378 --> 02:27.200
He wants an iced tea?

02:27.280 --> 02:31.485
I want a Diet Coconut, the biggest glass of water I can get.

02:35.811 --> 02:41.519
So, I mean, he wrote me a really great letter of advice that I taped above my desk while I wrote.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.342
He said a lot of smart things.

02:43.382 --> 02:46.246
One of them was, take no care for your dignity.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.789
Take no care for your dignity?

02:49.210 --> 02:50.792
But why did he advise against the novel?

02:51.093 --> 02:51.574
He didn't.

02:51.594 --> 02:52.915
I just wasn't able to do it.

02:52.935 --> 02:55.257
It would have made a terrific novel.

02:55.478 --> 02:58.101
No, but I don't know anything about writing a novel.

02:58.121 --> 03:00.343
But you write creatively.

03:00.363 --> 03:00.904
You write poetry.

03:01.064 --> 03:02.645
And it's filled with beautiful imagery.

03:02.806 --> 03:03.687
I know, I know.

03:03.747 --> 03:04.668
And it has a plot.

03:05.288 --> 03:08.632
But I think a memoir is necessarily anecdotal.

03:09.153 --> 03:13.157
The reader sort of allows for the fact there's going to be one story, then another story, then another story.

03:13.537 --> 03:17.902
And I try to have an overarching plot in it that pulls you forward a little bit.

03:18.002 --> 03:20.745
But a novel seems to me just such a

03:21.434 --> 03:25.941
When I tried to write a novel, I behaved better than I did in real life.

03:27.923 --> 03:37.217
So, I mean, some people, I've talked to real fiction writers, I think, find a novel easier to tell the truth in a novel, and I just found it easier to lie.

03:37.237 --> 03:40.742
Now, we talk about truth, of course, with a capital T, but I used to

03:41.026 --> 03:46.892
You certainly are recalling events that happened 33 and 33 years ago.

03:46.952 --> 03:47.993
Yeah, yeah, a long time ago.

03:49.014 --> 03:53.719
How confident are you in the accuracy of the detail, or is that relevant at all?

03:53.739 --> 03:54.340
Not at all.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.383
I mean, I can tell you a couple of interesting anecdotes.

03:57.823 --> 03:59.645
I mean, I saw it.

03:59.725 --> 04:01.207
I think there are two ways to write a memoir.

04:01.227 --> 04:09.295
You write a memoir as if it's an act of history, which I think Jeffrey did with his first book, where he went and he interviewed and he looked up records and he did all that.

04:09.629 --> 04:14.917
Or you can do it as an act of memory, which is what Toby did, I think, with this baseline.

04:14.937 --> 04:16.078
Particularly the last one.

04:16.299 --> 04:16.539
Yes.

04:16.819 --> 04:21.186
Where he said he took no notes in Vietnam because I knew I'd remember what was important.

04:21.566 --> 04:21.747
Yeah.

04:21.767 --> 04:22.768
And I'd forget that it wasn't.

04:22.848 --> 04:23.389
Yeah.

04:23.649 --> 04:30.920
So what I decided to do was to write it as a memory and then do some, a little, I did a little fact checking after.

04:30.940 --> 04:34.405
And certainly my mother and my sister both read it.

04:34.823 --> 04:36.285
There are some interesting things.

04:36.445 --> 04:51.524
One is that not only did they not correct a single point of fact, not one, but I just did an article for the June Harper's and the June Harper's Bazaar where I interviewed like half a dozen, like Frank Conroy, Jekyll Jeffrey, Maxine Hong Kingston.

04:51.804 --> 04:52.925
I saw that.

04:52.945 --> 04:54.828
Yeah, yeah.

04:54.848 --> 05:01.136
Not one of them had anyone in their family correct a fact.

05:01.156 --> 05:04.780
And, you know, the only thing I can figure is

05:05.030 --> 05:31.594
that I mean for a long time I just thought like in my family everybody was so tickled it was you know that we're gonna have a we're gonna settle down and raise a book you know that they you know they were excited about it that um but then it occurred to me that you know I think in a family you adjust all the time for um somebody else's perception you know like when you try to do the eulogy for for my dad's wedding

05:31.827 --> 05:34.751
He was a different dad for me than he was for my older sister.

05:34.811 --> 05:40.058
And I think families accommodate that, the difference in experience.

05:40.519 --> 05:45.325
I did have another sort of weird piece of anecdotal evidence about the veracity of it.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.549
I'm sure it's rife with mistakes.

05:48.710 --> 05:57.762
I went back to Colorado with my sister after I'd written a section on Colorado.

05:58.343 --> 05:59.404
And I have the worst

05:59.924 --> 06:28.986
memory for where i am of anybody in christendom i mean when i lived in boston i never went anywhere except on the subway or if someone came to get me but i'm just you put me outside i get lost i'm just the opposite are you my sister is like you i can be one place once and that's all you have to be i can go there 20 years later well that's why you live here okay i lived here i was lost for 13 years the whole time i was here i never knew where i was you lived here 13 years yeah a long time a long time

06:29.523 --> 06:38.635
Um, but I went to, I found all these, um, thank you, we were both killed for a glass of water.

06:39.216 --> 06:39.596
Oh boy.

06:42.260 --> 06:44.002
What's in there?

06:44.843 --> 06:46.666
Oh, for the tea.

06:47.307 --> 06:47.947
Oh, how smart.

06:47.967 --> 06:51.873
How inventive, I've never tried it.

06:51.933 --> 06:52.233
Yeah.

06:53.495 --> 06:54.276
Thanks a lot.

06:55.578 --> 06:55.918
Um,

06:57.232 --> 07:05.943
And I went right to all these places, like in the one town I went to the stable, I went to the little mountain trail where we rode our horses.

07:07.064 --> 07:16.315
And I do have a really good memory for language, and I tried to minimize the dialogue I did.

07:19.179 --> 07:22.883
You know, I tried to not have whole long passages of dialogue.

07:22.923 --> 07:25.146
I tried to do exposition.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.401
Here and there.

07:26.441 --> 07:35.634
I mean, except for the Liars Club stuff, which is obviously... That's the biggest fudge in the whole thing, is making up the... Of course, we all belong to Liars Clubs, I think.

07:37.076 --> 07:40.020
That's a metaphor that a few of your critics have picked up.

07:40.060 --> 07:40.741
No kidding.

07:40.841 --> 07:43.024
It's more than just Daddy's group.

07:43.044 --> 07:43.825
Oh, it's all of us.

07:44.065 --> 07:46.529
I mean, towards the very end, we're all liars.

07:46.869 --> 07:49.893
Any subjective truth is a lie, obviously.

07:50.093 --> 07:52.737
And, yeah, I pretty much...

07:53.138 --> 08:00.047
bellied up to the bar and said, you know, this is, um, I've chosen not to do an historical study.

08:00.227 --> 08:08.137
It's a subjective truth, and therefore, I mean, my mother said a smart thing, I thought, about the whole deal, which isn't she the ball?

08:08.938 --> 08:09.979
I wish you could see her now.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.262
She's such a sex poodle.

08:12.442 --> 08:13.684
She really is so cute.

08:14.485 --> 08:15.366
She's, um,

08:16.122 --> 08:16.823
She's hot.

08:16.903 --> 08:17.563
She really is.

08:17.583 --> 08:20.546
I mean, she's 74 years old, and she, you know, smokes.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.488
Kind of a poor lady's Elizabeth Taylor.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.349
She really is.

08:23.969 --> 08:25.050
She always did.

08:25.170 --> 08:28.513
I'll tell you, even now, 74 years old, she just had bypass surgery.

08:28.553 --> 08:30.876
You could send her out on the street, and she could pick somebody up.

08:31.176 --> 08:32.637
You send her to a museum.

08:32.657 --> 08:34.239
Those eyes.

08:34.259 --> 08:37.702
She has an old man to eat lunch with within 10 minutes.

08:38.282 --> 08:44.588
But she said an interesting thing that she said, I never knew that you didn't have, that you didn't understand.

08:44.708 --> 08:45.589
I'm trying to just check over.

08:46.008 --> 08:50.754
I don't blame you.

08:51.815 --> 08:56.841
She said, I can't believe you didn't understand my motives.

08:57.642 --> 09:01.827
You know, you didn't know that in fact I was trying to get you and your sister out of this town.

09:01.907 --> 09:09.757
I mean, my experience of it was she ripped me away from my father, took me to this place with all these crazy people, bought a bar and tried to drink herself to death.

09:10.498 --> 09:14.783
But in fact, she was trying to make a better life.

09:15.910 --> 09:19.014
I mean, it's a sort of wacky, you know, plan.

09:19.134 --> 09:21.056
But, no, she's terrific.

09:21.096 --> 09:22.018
I mean, she really is.

09:22.338 --> 09:27.865
Oh, I think that scene in the drinking the margaritas of the Mexican restaurant.

09:27.885 --> 09:30.168
Well, no, that is as true as I can remember it.

09:30.208 --> 09:31.469
It's absolutely wonderful.

09:31.970 --> 09:32.230
It really is.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.353
She said, I'll tell you, but we have to get drunk to do it.

09:34.453 --> 09:36.275
She was just like... Sounds good to me.

09:36.295 --> 09:37.797
I know, exactly.

09:37.817 --> 09:39.079
She's so great.

09:39.099 --> 09:39.860
And I love the image.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.682
This guy looks like a cut plumb.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.410
Oh, yeah.

09:43.730 --> 09:44.811
Thank you so much.

09:44.831 --> 09:45.212
I really like that.

09:45.232 --> 09:45.872
That's hers, huh?

09:45.892 --> 09:46.473
That's hers.

09:47.074 --> 09:47.955
Well, she's an artist.

09:48.375 --> 09:52.300
You know, she has this amazing visual intelligence, which I don't have.

09:52.340 --> 09:55.063
I'm pretty good with the words, you know.

09:55.163 --> 09:56.905
But she has this amazing eye.

09:57.325 --> 09:57.746
Visuals.

09:58.447 --> 09:59.007
Yeah.

09:59.408 --> 10:01.470
Now, how come just two years, basically?

10:01.991 --> 10:03.432
I mean, we have to go back.

10:03.452 --> 10:04.894
We go to 1980.

10:04.914 --> 10:10.420
I wanted to tell the plot that I had in mind had to do with this

10:10.957 --> 10:16.605
The one part of my childhood I didn't remember was the night when she had this big breakdown, dragged everything out in New York.

10:17.286 --> 10:29.724
And I guess I... But the big mystery, I mean, that was the only, you know, sort of part of my childhood that I had, that I didn't remember until I was in therapy.

10:29.784 --> 10:34.070
Everything else I remember, you know, none of it was repressed or forgotten or anything.

10:34.751 --> 10:39.478
But just the story of finding those...

10:39.627 --> 10:41.789
out about her past finding those kids.

10:42.770 --> 10:45.814
You kind of don't want us to mention that in that piece, right?

10:45.834 --> 10:46.494
It's up to you.

10:46.614 --> 10:48.777
I mean, other people have mentioned it, you know.

10:48.797 --> 10:53.862
I mean, you can say... It really is a climax.

10:54.022 --> 11:04.754
But the fact that she had this dark past, and... Oh, I must say, I sensed it when Grandma showed the picture, and we knew about the many husbands.

11:04.914 --> 11:05.234
Right.

11:06.155 --> 11:07.737
Who the hell is Belinda?

11:07.757 --> 11:08.518
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:09.019 --> 11:09.499
Yeah, yeah.

11:09.884 --> 11:15.451
But it's weird that my sister and I had the same experience, and then we both promptly forgot it.

11:15.611 --> 11:16.653
I mean, it's weird.

11:17.654 --> 11:23.141
And then when I started, again, so I wanted to tell that story.

11:23.221 --> 11:36.178
And that patch in our lives was the patch where things were craziest, where all our characters, I think, or all our feelings,

11:36.597 --> 11:39.960
as a family, were sort of at their peak for all of us.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.965
We all, I mean, most of my life wasn't this crazy, thank God.

11:45.446 --> 11:52.493
Now, was it just a decision to create Leachfield, just to, I mean, it's pretty obvious.

11:53.153 --> 11:54.615
A mythical place, yeah.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.516
A mythical, I mean, it's pretty obvious what it is.

11:56.536 --> 11:56.817
Right.

11:57.357 --> 11:58.018
Well, I, um.

11:58.038 --> 12:00.140
Especially in the biography where they say you grew up in Port Ireland.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.361
Yeah, exactly.

12:02.302 --> 12:03.263
Well, the, um,

12:05.234 --> 12:07.197
I didn't grow up in Port Arthur proper.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.843
There are, like, dozens of little towns that it could be.

12:11.424 --> 12:13.507
My mother still lives in the same house I lived in.

12:13.587 --> 12:14.529
I mean, that was one thing.

12:14.769 --> 12:16.292
And you know people there still.

12:16.312 --> 12:17.173
It's not even that.

12:17.213 --> 12:25.407
It was, like, people like the guy who was my grade school principal, you know, or just the guy who ran the drugstore and killed himself.

12:26.548 --> 12:29.453
How often are you dealing with living people here?

12:29.753 --> 12:31.516
Well, he's obviously not living.

12:31.536 --> 12:32.237
Yeah, but there are living people.

12:32.898 --> 12:34.160
Yeah, but I mean, that's the thing.

12:34.200 --> 12:40.269
You didn't want somebody who didn't know already to know, you know.

12:40.289 --> 12:43.835
I mean, anybody who grew up in my town knows that the guy who ran the drugstore blew his brains out.

12:43.855 --> 12:45.016
I mean, it's not a big secret.

12:45.637 --> 12:50.665
But you didn't want someone who didn't know to learn about it in some, I don't know.

12:51.134 --> 12:53.197
And I wanted as much as possible.

12:53.217 --> 12:56.522
I mean, I also changed the names of people who weren't in my immediate family.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.783
I bet you make that pretty clear.

12:57.904 --> 13:00.507
You even changed the names of Tex and Belinda.

13:00.567 --> 13:01.268
Yeah, exactly.

13:01.308 --> 13:02.330
Let's call it Reno.

13:02.430 --> 13:03.071
Yeah.

13:03.091 --> 13:04.072
I think it's cool.

13:04.092 --> 13:08.238
Now, you mentioned the reunion with these kids, and you leave it for them.

13:08.519 --> 13:11.483
You said, this is not my story, this is their story.

13:11.503 --> 13:12.705
Well, that's sort of how I feel.

13:12.785 --> 13:13.906
I mean, I really felt that way.

13:13.946 --> 13:20.095
I felt like, you know, my time with my parents was mine.

13:20.783 --> 13:30.914
And, I mean, I can say that it really, that they're, you know, terrific people and that they've stayed in touch with my mother and my brother, in fact, moved in with her.

13:31.815 --> 13:34.739
And they were really thrilled to find each other.

13:36.100 --> 13:39.424
I can't believe they pulled those kids away like that.

13:39.444 --> 13:39.724
I know.

13:39.824 --> 13:44.129
And they, see, they had always been told, I'd rather you not print this for his stepmother.

13:44.149 --> 13:47.533
The old man, their daddy's dead, but for the stepmother's sake, but...

13:47.935 --> 13:52.461
They had told them all their lives that she just ran off and left them.

13:52.481 --> 13:59.971
So when they heard this story, it had for them, one, their father wouldn't talk to them about it for the 15 years.

14:00.011 --> 14:01.153
I mean, he just died last year.

14:01.253 --> 14:10.886
But two, he... No, the evil one here is the grandmother, it seems to me.

14:10.906 --> 14:11.847
She seemed that way.

14:12.087 --> 14:15.732
The thing is, that's what my half-brother and sister...

14:16.066 --> 14:26.500
confirm that with me, that they remember her as this incredibly domineering, manipulative, controlling, a lot like my maternal grandmother, actually.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.161
She was something.

14:27.181 --> 14:28.183
She was a trap.

14:28.203 --> 14:35.673
Now, again, I felt like I had to say that my sister got along with her okay, but she also, she does remember that she was nuts.

14:35.813 --> 14:36.754
I mean, she was really crazy.

14:36.774 --> 14:37.015
Lisa.

14:37.055 --> 14:37.536
Lisa.

14:37.636 --> 14:38.357
Yeah.

14:40.139 --> 14:41.201
Crazy spelling.

14:41.221 --> 14:44.545
Well, she's on morphine or something when they ask her to put it on.

14:44.645 --> 14:45.887
Um,

14:47.167 --> 14:48.589
This is just a start.

14:48.669 --> 14:52.193
I'm wondering, this is such a poetic work and lyrical work.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.014
Oh, thank you.

14:53.155 --> 14:56.339
And, of course, you published two volumes of poetry, one of which I have.

14:56.419 --> 14:58.301
I'm so tickled, you have my poems.

14:58.321 --> 15:00.284
I wish I had the first book, but anyway, I'll find it.

15:00.704 --> 15:01.205
I collect.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.709
You're a bibliophile or something.

15:05.210 --> 15:05.430
Yeah, yeah.

15:05.450 --> 15:09.135
I have a book coming out from Hope in a Month on Bibliomania.

15:09.315 --> 15:10.277
Oh, you're kidding!

15:11.178 --> 15:12.119
Oh, that's great!

15:12.239 --> 15:13.401
What's it going to be called?

15:13.421 --> 15:14.963
The title is A Gentle Madness.

15:15.804 --> 15:16.144
Oh!

15:16.546 --> 15:21.033
Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and the internal passion for books.

15:21.173 --> 15:22.375
Oh, that's so great.

15:22.475 --> 15:24.879
And we just got our first Perkins review.

15:24.899 --> 15:25.500
Oh, how was it?

15:25.780 --> 15:26.321
I read it.

15:26.341 --> 15:27.242
Oh, that's great.

15:27.262 --> 15:31.028
I got more link than Sue Grafton, who's also a whole project.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.290
Oh, that's great.

15:33.091 --> 15:34.393
Isn't it great to be coming up?

15:34.894 --> 15:39.381
I sold more books than Stephen King last week.

15:39.682 --> 15:41.844
But his book was only out for like three days.

15:42.264 --> 15:44.787
Oh, you know where this piece is going to run, by the way?

15:45.207 --> 15:47.329
I have a paper in Long Island, Hamptons Magazine.

15:47.349 --> 15:48.390
Oh, you're kidding.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.291
Oh, great.

15:49.371 --> 15:50.112
Who might run?

15:50.472 --> 15:51.873
Well, I'm going to write it right away.

15:51.893 --> 15:52.514
Yeah, yeah.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.174
Oh, great.

15:53.194 --> 15:54.916
Why would I be out in the Hamptons this weekend?

15:54.936 --> 15:55.637
I know that.

15:55.957 --> 15:56.758
Oh, that's great.

15:57.178 --> 15:58.679
You know, I'm marketing.

15:58.699 --> 15:59.580
Oh, that's great.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.762
I'll have it in 25 or 30 papers.

16:01.782 --> 16:02.122
Wow.

16:02.423 --> 16:03.984
Salt Lake City, Eugene, Oregon.

16:04.024 --> 16:05.345
I'm into lots of college towns.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.186
Oh, that's great.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.107
And then...

16:07.745 --> 16:10.330
I mean, Knoxville, Gainesville, Charlottesville.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.556
I went up to the three girls and I got them, but they're all university.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.219
Toledo, Columbus.

16:15.239 --> 16:18.184
Well, now, will Paul, will my publicist know all this?

16:18.204 --> 16:18.685
I tell him, yeah.

16:18.705 --> 16:19.326
Okay.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.692
He said that you had a whole lot of syndications, but I just wanted to be sure that.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.475
My mother will send her all these clippings.

16:24.616 --> 16:25.938
I mean, that's what I do now.

16:26.078 --> 16:27.862
Well, they'll be in Austin for sure.

16:27.902 --> 16:28.483
For my mother.

16:28.503 --> 16:30.066
So great.

16:30.086 --> 16:30.867
Tallahassee.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.301
Absolutely.

16:32.321 --> 16:33.302
Let's not talk about that.

16:33.483 --> 16:35.285
But anyway, we will get a lot of pickup.

16:35.405 --> 16:36.827
Oh, terrific.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.249
I've been so lucky already.

16:38.269 --> 16:39.290
I mean, press-wise, it's been wonderful.

16:39.310 --> 16:39.631
It's great.

16:39.711 --> 16:40.311
It's been wonderful.

16:40.331 --> 16:43.015
I mean, Mishiko's piece in The Times was a mind-blower.

16:43.576 --> 16:44.397
Oh, my trip.

16:45.398 --> 16:47.380
What were you just talking about, by the way?

16:47.901 --> 16:54.229
I guess I'm curious when the... Can I ask the question of when... Yeah, I started to talk about the poetry.

16:54.269 --> 16:57.173
When the poet's voice started to assert itself.

16:58.314 --> 17:00.297
Well, I mean, look at... I know you say five years old.

17:00.665 --> 17:02.567
That was when I decided I wanted to be a poet.

17:03.347 --> 17:05.930
There were a bunch of... There was one E.E.

17:05.970 --> 17:13.457
Cummings poem I really loved, and my mother taught me, read me, and I... I have a really good memory for poetry, and I did even as a child.

17:13.537 --> 17:14.978
And then there's A.A.

17:15.018 --> 17:17.841
Milne poems and the Winnie the Pooh books I always really liked.

17:18.661 --> 17:29.271
And I think you grow up with my dad, you know, who has this... comes from this oral tradition that's just

17:29.875 --> 17:30.856
all metaphor.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.241
You know, it's raining like a cow fist on a flat rock.

17:35.203 --> 17:42.734
I mean, if you start reading Milton, you know, the mind is its own place and it can make a hell of heaven or a heaven of hell.

17:43.034 --> 17:44.697
It's just like home to me.

17:44.817 --> 17:49.884
I mean, that didn't seem, that wasn't hard for me to, I was ready for that stuff.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.126
You know, I was hungry for it.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.690
And of course your father was such a great storyteller.

17:53.710 --> 17:53.830
Yeah.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.254
He was an unbelievably good storyteller.

17:56.274 --> 17:57.115
He really was.

17:57.787 --> 18:00.149
really, I mean, you know, really tickled me.

18:00.369 --> 18:02.551
Did you think in terms of imagery at all?

18:04.693 --> 18:05.454
When I was a kid?

18:05.514 --> 18:05.774
Yeah.

18:08.117 --> 18:08.817
I think so.

18:09.618 --> 18:10.399
You know, I think so.

18:10.419 --> 18:23.291
I mean, my mother was so visual and my father had this wonderful descriptive language, metaphoric language, you know, and yeah, I think so.

18:24.732 --> 18:25.853
Are you hopeful that the

18:26.288 --> 18:33.316
You talked directly to this kid that abused you, seven years old, eight, whatever it was.

18:33.336 --> 18:37.181
Are you hopeful that this will be brought to you with some religious attention, I'm sure?

18:37.241 --> 18:37.782
I don't know.

18:38.022 --> 18:39.103
You know his name, I'm sure.

18:39.203 --> 18:39.684
Sure, sure.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.707
I don't know what I want from that.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.992
I just wanted to... I guess so, yeah.

18:46.152 --> 18:48.194
That was lose-lose for you the whole way, wasn't it?

18:48.294 --> 18:48.835
What do you mean?

18:48.955 --> 18:50.938
Well, I mean, there's nothing you could have done about it.

18:51.038 --> 18:52.099
Because my father would have killed him.

18:52.119 --> 18:54.642
Would have killed him, but you would have been...

18:55.853 --> 19:02.460
Yeah, but even if I weren't, I knew my daddy would kill him and he would go to jail.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.902
It's just no question.

19:03.962 --> 19:05.403
Got him like a fish.

19:05.463 --> 19:06.625
Would not have hesitated.

19:07.425 --> 19:10.349
I mean, you know, it's funny, you know, I mean, in some ways.

19:11.390 --> 19:12.531
No, no, but it is funny.

19:12.551 --> 19:23.903
I mean, it's funny that, you know, that the desire, I mean, probably there's some Italian girls, you know, have the same thing, you know, I mean, the desire to protect the women in your family can actually wind up

19:25.081 --> 19:30.727
You know, interfering with their ability to, you know, talk about such a thing.

19:30.807 --> 19:34.611
I mean, it's ironic.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.032
But you talk to him directly, though.

19:36.092 --> 19:36.693
Yeah, I do.

19:36.753 --> 19:37.694
I just step right out.

19:38.475 --> 19:39.276
I was pissed.

19:39.296 --> 19:41.818
I mean, I think this happens to a lot of people.

19:41.879 --> 19:42.759
I mean, just say that.

19:42.819 --> 19:54.852
I mean, I think the last statistic I heard, which I'm sure is inaccurate, either because I'm misremembering it, was that one in three women and one in five men had sexually abused in some way.

19:55.287 --> 19:59.613
And I think most people, you know, take their power back.

20:00.855 --> 20:16.217
You know, I think most people do just say, you know, I can't speak for anybody else, but I just, if those statistics are true, obviously we're not all walking around, a third of the women in America aren't walking around, you know, thinking what, you know.

20:16.257 --> 20:21.384
I don't mean to be maudlin, but I mean, do you see it as a loss of innocence of some sort for yourself?

20:22.065 --> 20:24.088
It wasn't, no.

20:24.128 --> 20:24.248
No.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.338
Actually, I don't.

20:25.498 --> 20:33.308
It didn't have anything to do with... In fact, you're looking back as you write it, it's almost like you understood that you were set up by this guy for this.

20:33.328 --> 20:34.089
I don't know if I would.

20:34.109 --> 20:41.798
I mean, I remember just wondering, you know, whether it had been planned in advance or whether it was an occasion.

20:42.198 --> 20:50.908
And I didn't know which would be worse, you know, whether I'd been sort of stalked and looked for or whether it was just one of those carpe diem deals for him.

20:51.549 --> 20:52.210
But...

20:53.573 --> 20:56.156
I mean, both seem really diminishing and terrifying.

20:59.140 --> 21:01.263
You know, it was a bad night.

21:04.366 --> 21:17.843
But I think, you know, these, you know, I mean, you can also be born in Rwanda, you know, I mean, just in all fairness to me on the, you know, I don't think, I just had a radio interview, you know, where the woman just talked to me like I was,

21:19.072 --> 21:21.334
as if I were Oliver Twist or something.

21:21.354 --> 21:30.664
You know, I was just this Dickensian child, you know, just beaten and abused, and I was just like... Well, you do describe it as a dysfunctional family, though.

21:30.684 --> 21:31.505
You describe it.

21:31.525 --> 21:32.746
It was nuts.

21:32.766 --> 21:34.568
And this was the worst time in our lives.

21:34.648 --> 21:38.812
I mean, it was a... I think every family has a really bad patch.

21:39.012 --> 21:44.178
I mean, probably not this bad, but... But that's the thing.

21:44.238 --> 21:48.522
I mean, a dysfunctional family, I once heard described as any family has more than one person in it.

21:49.177 --> 21:54.342
So, and in some ways, we did function.

21:54.362 --> 21:56.264
We just functioned differently than other people.

21:57.005 --> 21:59.627
And, in fact, we're very good now.

22:00.368 --> 22:05.353
A lot of the things we should be good at, we've got ten minutes.

22:06.054 --> 22:13.081
A lot of the things we should have been good at, like baking cookies and having funerals and taking care of sick people, we're not so good at.

22:13.421 --> 22:17.125
We're really good at various kinds of crises.

22:18.387 --> 22:20.711
getting things done in a weird way.

22:20.791 --> 22:26.381
I mean, my childhood bred a weird competence in myself and my sister.

22:27.463 --> 22:34.636
You know what I think really impresses me is that you don't look back with any degree of bitterness to those years.

22:34.656 --> 22:35.277
Who does?

22:36.058 --> 22:36.699
Who does?

22:37.060 --> 22:41.728
I mean, whose parents didn't, you know, I was talking to somebody and I was saying, you know,

22:42.248 --> 23:05.148
In fact, this radio interviewer was talking to me like I was this, you know, little wounded bird, and I said, you know, there are people whose parents never raise their voices, never do anything that you couldn't have on the 5 o'clock news, and exude such a steady stream of low-key scorn and disapproval for their children.

23:05.928 --> 23:08.611
Now, that's a burden I didn't have to bear, you know.

23:09.091 --> 23:11.293
My parents both gave me the sense

23:12.117 --> 23:39.610
that I was adorable, you know, in some, I mean, really, in some, and, you know what I'm saying, I mean, I'm framing these quotes, I can see them in print, you know, but, no, but it's true, but it's true that, yeah, there are people, you know, you know, who grow up with a lot more money, and a lot, who don't have these kinds of periods in their lives, and who had less, sort of, bottom line approval,

23:40.197 --> 23:48.712
My mother still thinks, I mean, even now, you know, things are, you know, coming out, there's a thing in Time Magazine today, you know, about her, you know, getting drunk and not being able to do anything.

23:48.732 --> 23:49.313
In Time Magazine?

23:49.333 --> 23:49.834
Yeah.

23:49.854 --> 23:50.054
Today?

23:50.315 --> 23:51.918
Yeah.

23:51.938 --> 23:56.506
And, um, I can't even remember the thing.

23:56.566 --> 23:57.327
You have to look at it.

23:57.888 --> 24:00.192
Her getting drunk and not being able to take care of us.

24:01.194 --> 24:04.259
And I called her about this when they first, when the reviews started coming.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.361
And, um,

24:06.303 --> 24:07.865
I said, Mother, does this upset you at all?

24:07.885 --> 24:10.788
And she says, oh, shit, honey.

24:10.808 --> 24:17.795
If I'd been the kind of person who gave a shit what people thought, I would have been home baking cookies and going to PTA, which I didn't do.

24:18.976 --> 24:22.479
And she just thinks this is great.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.604
I mean, her thought is, isn't this wonderful for Mary?

24:26.624 --> 24:28.946
She's been writing all these years, you know.

24:28.986 --> 24:30.407
Getting some attention, though.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.028
Yeah.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.523
I'd make a little bit of money driving on.

24:33.603 --> 24:34.064
Exactly, exactly.

24:34.124 --> 24:38.367
I mean, you know, a lot of people's mothers would be, you know... I'm bald.

24:38.508 --> 24:44.593
Yeah, I mean, she's also been sober for 13 years.

24:45.054 --> 24:50.759
You know, Pat Conroy, who writes novels about his family, I'm seeing him in New York on Wednesday before.

24:50.879 --> 24:52.180
Oh, really?

24:52.480 --> 24:53.081
And he's a friend.

24:53.101 --> 24:54.883
He's right next to me in Time Magnum.

24:54.903 --> 24:55.543
Is he?

24:55.583 --> 24:56.124
Oh, really?

24:56.144 --> 24:58.686
Then I'll have to get it, because I haven't seen him in the years of the book.

24:59.223 --> 25:00.344
Oh, they jumped the gun.

25:00.684 --> 25:02.927
I'm supposed to have a first interview with him.

25:03.767 --> 25:04.648
It's very brief.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.410
I mean, it's Time Magazine.

25:06.430 --> 25:07.371
We're both on one page.

25:07.411 --> 25:15.859
But supposedly, when his father read The Great Santee, and this is fiction, read The Great Santee, he threw the book across the room, so furious, and disappeared for three days.

25:16.300 --> 25:19.643
And then when his mother was divorcing his father, she entered that book in evidence.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.706
I mean, she gave it to the judge and said, this is what I read.

25:22.846 --> 25:28.892
So you're talking about fiction, and these are supposed to be novels.

25:29.328 --> 25:43.011
and yet here are the families going ballistic over what they read in... I mean, the other advantage I have in my family is, I mean, these things were secret for a long time, but there got to be a time when they weren't anymore.

25:44.193 --> 25:50.524
So, for instance, I've had a lot of conversations with my mother over like a 15-year period about this period of time.

25:52.567 --> 25:55.352
Fewer, actually, with my sister, and I think in some ways...

25:55.720 --> 25:58.323
The book has been much harder for her.

25:58.903 --> 25:59.284
For your sister?

25:59.304 --> 26:06.512
Yeah, even though she's not ashamed of how she's portrayed.

26:06.752 --> 26:09.174
I mean, you know, she's sort of a hero in the book.

26:09.194 --> 26:09.895
She's not portrayed badly at all.

26:09.915 --> 26:11.177
No, no, it's not that.

26:11.257 --> 26:16.362
But I think it's been painful for her to remember that it all happened.

26:16.382 --> 26:18.905
And she sort of dealt with it by not dealing with it.

26:19.385 --> 26:21.287
But you don't look back on it as a nightmare.

26:22.128 --> 26:23.310
The whole period of time?

26:23.410 --> 26:23.770
Yeah.

26:24.256 --> 26:28.200
It was a really bad, I mean, it was the worst time in my childhood.

26:28.300 --> 26:28.761
For sure.

26:28.781 --> 26:33.706
But it seems to me that the grandmother was 18 months ago.

26:33.726 --> 26:34.467
Yeah, exactly.

26:34.487 --> 26:34.767
She was awful.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.089
That must have been terrible.

26:36.109 --> 26:40.613
It was terrible, and it was scary, you know, when my mom was... And the smells proper.

26:40.634 --> 26:40.914
Oh, I know.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.255
You know, it's everything.

26:42.275 --> 26:43.757
You can smell something that I can.

26:44.378 --> 26:46.500
You can go shooting back 25 years.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.020
I know.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.584
It's supposed to be the seat of emotional memory or something.

26:50.604 --> 26:50.804
Really?

26:51.225 --> 26:53.267
That's what I read somewhere in some, like,

26:53.585 --> 26:54.626
in the Science Times.

26:55.408 --> 26:59.273
You came up with an image of a water moccasin of a snake.

27:00.275 --> 27:01.396
Have you ever smelled one?

27:01.416 --> 27:02.518
No, I haven't.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.900
They really smell bad.

27:04.260 --> 27:06.784
In fact, I don't know if there is another snake.

27:06.844 --> 27:09.528
I was just down in Central America and saw a lot of snakes.

27:10.269 --> 27:12.192
I don't know if there is another reptile.

27:13.433 --> 27:20.824
I mean, it smells like a... You know, if you leave a... Hemingway is a great...

27:22.812 --> 27:26.016
I believe it's in a story.

27:26.897 --> 27:29.640
It might even be in that story where he dies.

27:29.660 --> 27:29.820
Oh, God.

27:32.864 --> 27:37.149
But anyway, where he's describing what death smells like.

27:38.090 --> 27:51.807
And he says, you know, if you leave the flowers and all the whorehouses that have been rotting and left in the water and not taken out, and they take that and they take the slop buckets and they pour that out, and that's what death smells like.

27:52.343 --> 28:03.433
And, you know, I mean, that's what the snake, the thing of the rotting flowers in the water, that's what those snakes smell like on the ground.

28:04.354 --> 28:08.458
And that's what my grandmother smelled like, or that's what I remember her smelling like.

28:08.818 --> 28:10.960
That's the image.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.162
But where did the nickname pokey come from?

28:13.182 --> 28:14.383
I don't have any idea.

28:14.403 --> 28:19.768
You know, I've often wondered, in retrospect, if it didn't come from a, I was a very, um,

28:20.508 --> 28:30.197
As high-strung as I am now, it's hard to believe, but I was a very fat, affable, slow-moving child.

28:30.397 --> 28:32.399
I dawdled endlessly.

28:32.940 --> 28:39.006
So I don't know if it's because I was Pokey, or if it was from, like, Gumby, and he had a little pony named Pokey, remember?

28:39.026 --> 28:40.127
I don't know where it came from.

28:40.167 --> 28:41.948
He was a mine of names like this.

28:41.968 --> 28:45.031
I mean, he came up with names for everybody, you know.

28:45.692 --> 28:48.895
Would you say that your father was the love of your mother's life in your own?

28:49.735 --> 28:53.519
Gosh, I couldn't speak for her.

28:53.539 --> 28:56.021
She certainly spent the longest time with him.

28:56.061 --> 29:03.128
And, you know, she's the one husband, I guess, who would have been willing to take... Who put up with her.

29:03.148 --> 29:05.350
Who also would have taken the two other kids.

29:05.370 --> 29:05.590
Yes.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.972
Yeah, that was his... Which is noble.

29:07.992 --> 29:08.152
Yeah.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.475
No, he loved kids.

29:11.515 --> 29:12.757
I mean, he was one of these guys.

29:13.497 --> 29:16.720
If you had him in a restaurant and there was a kid, he'd have to have its attention.

29:16.780 --> 29:17.481
You know what I mean?

29:18.068 --> 29:21.413
or a bar or something, somebody had a bed of you would have to hold it, you know.

29:21.713 --> 29:22.675
You just love kids.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.057
You like little kids.

29:24.077 --> 29:30.126
And was it hard for you to establish this voice with a couple of new reviews?

29:30.146 --> 29:31.969
I don't know if you've seen Gayle Caldwell's review yet.

29:31.989 --> 29:32.870
I heard it was great.

29:32.910 --> 29:34.533
Somebody read it to me, but I haven't seen it.

29:34.673 --> 29:35.735
Sarah Constantine.

29:35.775 --> 29:36.776
She's a Texas gal.

29:36.796 --> 29:37.297
I know.

29:37.617 --> 29:37.858
I know.

29:37.898 --> 29:40.662
Every time there's a Texan, I'm all tickled.

29:40.682 --> 29:45.409
And she throws a few little lines in herself, you know.

29:46.655 --> 29:48.597
Well, I think... I think she's West Texas.

29:48.877 --> 29:52.080
Actually, she said she grew up within spitting distance of Europe.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.001
Oh, is that right?

29:53.021 --> 29:54.323
Oh, is that right?

29:54.343 --> 29:54.803
Yeah, she said.

29:54.863 --> 29:55.904
It sounds like it.

29:57.466 --> 29:58.667
If you don't get them, you will.

29:58.687 --> 29:59.287
Oh, I'll get it.

29:59.688 --> 30:01.049
They'll send it to me eventually.

30:01.770 --> 30:04.072
I've been trying not to pay too much attention to them.

30:04.833 --> 30:06.134
You know, I think it's not healthy.

30:06.375 --> 30:07.736
Yeah, I agree.

30:07.876 --> 30:09.558
I just think it's none of my business.

30:09.578 --> 30:12.060
The worst thing people can do is ask you what your world needs are.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.962
You know, what you don't want.

30:14.515 --> 30:15.076
Who cares?

30:15.296 --> 30:17.098
I just, it's none of my business, you know.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.763
I write the books and they do it.

30:21.164 --> 30:24.067
But you asked about my father's, about my voice.

30:24.568 --> 30:28.894
I just pretty much tried to steal his voice as much as possible.

30:29.254 --> 30:29.855
For this memoir.

30:30.276 --> 30:33.139
In a way, yeah, I see it really as an homage to him.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.723
He was a real, it's funny, it's interesting.

30:35.763 --> 30:38.206
I don't see him more than your mother.

30:38.226 --> 30:39.848
My mother's not a great storyteller.

30:40.958 --> 30:44.421
My mother does very dramatic things that are fun to write about.

30:44.441 --> 30:46.803
The book, though, is an homage to your father?

30:46.823 --> 30:47.724
The voices.

30:47.784 --> 30:48.685
The voices.

30:48.705 --> 30:49.766
Okay, I misunderstood.

30:49.886 --> 30:51.848
He had a couple of things.

30:51.888 --> 30:59.895
He had an amazing ability to imitate somebody and to capture, like Chekhov, like in a single detail, somebody's character.

31:00.676 --> 31:07.842
You know, to say the one thing about them that would tell you everything about the character.

31:07.882 --> 31:08.583
The precise ones.

31:08.623 --> 31:08.923
Yes.

31:09.376 --> 31:23.758
Well, and the thing, the detail, you know, how their hair was, or a big guy who happened to have small feminine hands, you know, or, you know, something like, he was just very astute student of character.

31:24.619 --> 31:37.999
And then he had this wonderful idiom with all this great metaphor and description, and he also had real, I mean, I had, I set down a story of his, I think, I transcribed it,

31:38.435 --> 32:07.969
from tape in one of the last two chapters he had real pacing he had the ability to pace something to plant something at the beginning that you would then sort of suspense i guess you would sort of wonder until the end about it and then to pace it in such a way as to increase the drama did you know when you were writing this that you were pointing towards this final section i knew that i was yeah because i wrote a proposal for it

32:08.287 --> 32:30.092
before I wrote it, and I knew that I wanted to cover this two-year period, and I knew that I would, that any reader would want to know what happened, you know, after this time, and that I would have to leap forward, and so my editor kept working, saying, you know, have you figured out how you're going to move forward in time, have you figured out anything, and so I finally

32:31.287 --> 32:34.892
you know, before I got there, I said, how about 17 years later?

32:34.912 --> 32:37.736
I mean, you know what I mean?

32:37.916 --> 32:39.578
It's not an epilogue in any way.

32:39.598 --> 32:40.780
It really is part of the book.

32:40.800 --> 32:54.058
It's supposed to be part, I mean, yeah, you want to know what the story is, and that's where the secret comes out, and that's, so, I mean, I tried to have it have a whole, you know, plot, and there was just an intervening 17 years.

32:54.118 --> 32:56.001
I thought you wouldn't like me anymore.

32:56.321 --> 32:58.604
It's heartbreaking.

32:58.624 --> 32:59.185
I know.

32:59.671 --> 33:25.611
she is so unbelievable i tell you something about my mother you really could she has a wonderful quality i got really mad at her a couple years ago when my marriage broke up i went i took my son down to texas she promised me she would take care of him while i worked out every day and he was a toddler and a wild man just like a i should go see him just like a chimpanzee and he said um

33:27.194 --> 33:31.900
She said she'd take care of him, swore up and down, yes, yes, I'll do this, I'll do this.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.424
And after a couple days, she said, I can't for an hour, guys.

33:34.484 --> 33:35.345
She said, I can't do this.

33:35.365 --> 33:36.426
You know I don't do kids.

33:37.588 --> 33:40.712
And I said, Mother, you don't do kids.

33:40.732 --> 33:42.074
You don't cook, you don't claim.

33:42.094 --> 33:43.536
You haven't had a job in 40 years.

33:43.696 --> 33:45.358
What exactly do you bring to the party?

33:46.059 --> 33:50.365
And she said, she thought for a minute, she said, I'm a lot of fun to be with.

33:51.626 --> 33:52.948
That's the quote we can end a piece with.

33:53.148 --> 33:54.731
Isn't that a great?

33:55.011 --> 33:56.294
Well, somebody's got to use it.

33:56.334 --> 33:57.095
It's too good.

33:57.115 --> 34:03.166
I do, and it's... What kind of name is that?

34:04.008 --> 34:04.669
Good for you.

34:04.729 --> 34:09.418
We've got a good interview here.
