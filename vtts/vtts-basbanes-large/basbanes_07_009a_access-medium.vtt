WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:08.852
Right down there or something.

00:08.872 --> 00:11.082
Okay, that's good.

00:11.183 --> 00:12.167
In the case of

00:12.485 --> 00:21.276
an ornithological collection like Bradley Martin, there's no question that every effort should have been made to have kept it intact.

00:21.376 --> 00:28.745
And if we'd been asked to make a proposal for the sale, that's what we would have proposed.

00:28.785 --> 00:31.909
We would have proposed attempting to try and keep it intact.

00:31.929 --> 00:34.573
And how would you have gone about doing that?

00:34.753 --> 00:38.037
Offering it as a private...

00:38.371 --> 00:58.101
we would have handled the high spot sale first bringing in a lot of money up front just as we did with Doheny One and then we would have held the bird collection until the end of the series

00:58.418 --> 01:02.344
giving us time throughout the series to have tried to market it en bloc.

01:02.424 --> 01:11.919
There was a strong certainty that we couldn't have sold it en bloc, that at least we would have been seen to have made the attempt.

01:12.260 --> 01:13.462
We would have given it a chance.

01:13.502 --> 01:15.545
Have you done that?

01:15.565 --> 01:17.869
Is there any question for that?

01:18.109 --> 01:26.282
We tried it later with Kistner, we failed, but an attempt was made.

01:26.667 --> 01:32.355
And certainly there wasn't the flag.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.365
There wouldn't have been the flag.

01:34.767 --> 01:43.518
that was received by the Sotheby's, the Martin's, and everything else.

01:43.559 --> 01:49.326
There was a lot of flat due principally to the ornithological dispersal.

01:49.346 --> 01:50.087
Yes, yes.

01:50.107 --> 01:52.290
It's really strictly the ornithological stuff.

01:52.310 --> 01:55.014
Yeah, that's right.

01:55.034 --> 01:59.339
Have you been involved well in talks of the Mulholland, the magic collection?

01:59.600 --> 02:00.881
No, I've not been involved.

02:00.901 --> 02:02.744
Have you heard any scuttlebutt?

02:03.244 --> 02:03.745
No.

02:03.944 --> 02:09.350
I've offered my services, but I've heard no talks about it.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.774
I heard some talk.

02:15.197 --> 02:18.941
Anyway, I just mentioned that as a piece of gossip that I'll pick up out there.

02:19.462 --> 02:23.286
I would say considering the source, it's probably pretty good.

02:23.566 --> 02:24.568
Yes.

02:24.668 --> 02:30.154
Oh, by the way, we do a round during the

02:30.860 --> 02:38.611
The crazy years, and I'm not calling them the crazy years, but the wild years, the reckless years of acquisition... Of ransom.

02:38.671 --> 02:39.953
Of ransom, yeah.

02:40.173 --> 02:53.432
No, I first visited the University of Texas in 1972 and was entertained by the Lawrence scholar, Roberts.

02:54.012 --> 02:59.500
Warren Roberts, who succeeded...

02:59.783 --> 03:26.770
anytime you want to order i'd like to order yeah yes that's good you have a monkfish yes we do um yeah give me a quick biographical uh thing on yourself how long have you been with christie's here in new york how long have you been involved with rare books just so i can have a background i started in the uh rare book business on a holiday job in 1962

03:26.986 --> 03:28.910
Christie's London.

03:29.692 --> 03:34.242
My father, my grandfather, and my great-grandfather were in the Red Book business.

03:34.823 --> 03:40.656
And my grandfather and my father were directors of Pickering and Chateau.

03:41.758 --> 03:47.070
My father died in 1980, and William Reece-Mogg bought Pickering and Chateau in 1981.

03:47.742 --> 03:57.156
My uncle is the only surviving partner left and he lives in retirement in Ireland.

03:58.598 --> 04:11.217
I joined Christie's full time in August 1964 in London, remained with them until March 1975 and I came straight over here.

04:12.499 --> 04:16.365
Been with them now for 27 years.

04:16.970 --> 04:28.061
I started coming over here on business trips from London in 1969, 70, 71, 72, not 73, then in 74.

04:28.141 --> 04:39.552
So I've been in contact with this country steadily for 22 years on business.

04:39.953 --> 04:42.235
And I used to do a lot of business with the dealers every year.

04:42.957 --> 04:54.609
Before we get back to Texas, so you've actually been able to observe for 22 years from this vantage point of the action, so to speak.

04:54.629 --> 04:59.995
I've observed the American action, sure, but not in great detail.

05:00.135 --> 05:04.760
I mean, I was 23 when I first came over here, but I certainly, yeah.

05:05.741 --> 05:12.508
Well, the dealers I was closest to when I came over here were Mike Papantonio.

05:12.708 --> 05:16.693
who was a great, great friend of my father, because they dealt in the same kind of hook.

05:16.753 --> 05:22.520
They had a kind of rapport, and my father represented Seven Gables at Auckland.

05:22.540 --> 05:26.965
I met Bart when I first came over here in 1969.

05:27.065 --> 05:34.474
Mike gave Bart $10 out of the till and said, take Stephen out for a night on the town.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.459
And we went down to the Whitehorse Tavern.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.382
And, you know, he...

05:42.425 --> 05:45.788
That was 69, so I've never brought that long.

05:46.148 --> 05:47.630
Is the action still here?

05:47.970 --> 05:53.395
Or has it really shifted as people... Different kinds of action for different places.

05:53.555 --> 06:10.390
I mean, there's no doubt in my mind of the strength of the London market, for example, for a bullish and aggressive trade in the colour plate market and the...

06:10.825 --> 06:37.474
sort of voyages and travel and yet if you have a focus sail like this DuPont sail or a focus sail like a sail of high spots it's going to do just as well or better in New York because somehow you can pull in

06:38.146 --> 06:44.933
that private money to at least participate in the sale, which wouldn't otherwise go there

06:45.267 --> 07:09.267
to the west end of london part of california as they say not a california something like that but i mean basically new york new york is yeah the californians are wondering why they it doesn't go out there i mean why they don't have auctions yeah because they have so many collectors out there you could certainly have auctions out in california did but did you ever talk to um

07:09.550 --> 07:38.528
did you ever talk to david redden about the demise of sotheby's california no i went to sotheby's california in 72 and i think there was a portfolio of shakespeare sold which mike had sent a bid on and that was one of the i guess that was the last sort of moderately large sale that sotheby's ever held in the book division over there and quite simply

07:38.879 --> 07:57.478
Sotheby's California was closed up as far as I know because it was competing with home base and you can see it I mean if you I mean we just we just laid off 50 people in Glasgow two weeks ago well

07:57.712 --> 08:02.180
You might ask yourself, what the hell were we doing in Glasgow in the first place?

08:04.444 --> 08:06.968
That's a lot of people even have, never mind layoffs.

08:06.988 --> 08:07.649
That's what I'm saying.

08:07.689 --> 08:09.091
What were we doing up there?

08:09.112 --> 08:18.167
But I mean, between 1988 and 1990, you could open anywhere and do it, because you've got the money coming out of your... What happened?

08:19.463 --> 08:22.248
Now everything's tightened up a bit.

08:22.268 --> 08:26.375
You mentioned focus at single owner sales, such as the Manny sale.

08:26.435 --> 08:31.644
Dick Manny is a character of mine, and I do see these people as characters.

08:31.664 --> 08:33.147
He's a creation of yours, is he?

08:33.167 --> 08:33.888
He's a character.

08:33.928 --> 08:35.872
I have characters in this book.

08:35.892 --> 08:36.673
You certainly do.

08:36.693 --> 08:40.560
Because I've been with him, not with him, but I've watched him from the beginning.

08:40.962 --> 09:08.590
I first met Arthur Houghton in 1912 from London and was given his phone number by a colleague of mine in London called Michael Tree and nobody from my firm in London had ever met Arthur Houghton so I rang him up at his New York office

09:09.025 --> 09:14.291
and was told that he was in Maryland and they gave me the Maryland number.

09:14.311 --> 09:16.634
So I phoned Maryland and said, I'd like to come and see him.

09:16.654 --> 09:18.617
He said, I'd love to see you and come on down.

09:19.778 --> 09:24.424
And I went to stay with him and the house was being built on the Eastern Shore.

09:25.585 --> 09:33.395
We had sort of kitchen supper and I stayed over the library and we had a lot of old Fitzgerald way into the night.

09:34.456 --> 09:35.978
And he showed me his...

09:36.329 --> 10:01.932
he showed me his books and we became friendly and I he asked me in 1977 when I'd been over here if I would do an appraisal updating an appraisal done by John Fleming and I said yes I'd love to do it and he said well who would you use to oversee your work and I said well can I share it with Mike Cavantonio and he said yes so Mike and I

10:02.232 --> 10:02.693
Really?

10:02.753 --> 10:04.755
Did an appraisal in the summer of 77.

10:04.795 --> 10:17.671
Then Arthur was very instrumental and helpful in the sale we had at Christie's in 1978 at the General Theological Seminary Gutenberg Bible.

10:20.395 --> 10:22.317
The Freslauer.

10:22.853 --> 10:27.599
on behalf of the Landes Bibliothek in Stuttgart.

10:29.963 --> 10:40.837
And so Arthur... Arthur then in 79 and 80, as Ralph has just said, he sold his collection with us in London.

10:41.939 --> 10:47.806
He wanted to sell the books in London because he's a great Anglophile.

10:47.847 --> 10:51.932
He loved the idea of the books selling well in London and in many ways...

10:53.228 --> 11:00.086
He was right because Quarrett went very strong for the British Library on the things they didn't have.

11:01.791 --> 11:08.689
Barton and I have always thought that probably the 18th and 19th century might have done better over here.

11:09.175 --> 11:11.918
And there were spectacular strengths in all areas, you see.

11:12.698 --> 11:37.022
The reason I say that is because the street assail took place at a time when there was a particular strength in the purchasing power of the institutions.

11:37.424 --> 11:45.443
in this country very important and we don't see that now

11:45.794 --> 11:59.531
And I think you'd find that Clarence Wolfe and Bill Rees would have to work awfully hard for another Street of Sale coming up in the 90s, but they've got to sell the stuff on.

12:01.193 --> 12:02.374
That's a very interesting point.

12:02.394 --> 12:07.961
Whereas the gardeners, Doheny and Martin had this amazing range.

12:07.981 --> 12:09.503
And there were high spots.

12:09.843 --> 12:13.928
Lots of high spots, which appealed to people like Dick Manning.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.574
He's now selling his books next month.

12:18.097 --> 12:19.299
Yeah, I don't think you can compare.

12:20.301 --> 12:35.511
Yeah, I know what you mean, but I think the garden sale had a certain... It didn't have as much age as you really want, but it had a certain age to it.

12:35.710 --> 12:39.356
Haven had been around buying since 1976.

12:39.496 --> 12:43.943
And then it gets sold in 1989.

12:44.324 --> 12:45.846
That's 13 years.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.293
And the books were impeccably chosen.

12:52.156 --> 12:58.326
And they were superb.

12:59.548 --> 13:02.713
That we did lose in straight combat to Sotheby's.

13:03.487 --> 13:10.017
Well, you must expect that that's on my agenda to talk about today.

13:10.498 --> 13:16.027
I've been through the docket of the civil case in Massachusetts.

13:16.047 --> 13:17.229
Oh, that's right.

13:17.249 --> 13:18.631
You mentioned that at the opening.

13:18.651 --> 13:24.741
And quite clearly, the stuff had gone to Christie's first.

13:24.801 --> 13:29.528
Not as material, but you did an appraisal on that.

13:29.549 --> 13:29.609
No.

13:29.629 --> 13:30.490
Let's backtrack.

13:31.178 --> 13:58.873
A lawyer for Michael Davis came to New York without identifying the name of his client at first but saying he represented the Garden Limited or a partner in the Garden Limited rather and that they were looking for an appraisal prior to

13:59.107 --> 14:25.424
the dissolution of this partnership, which might require, at some stage, a sale of... And this particular lawyer was exploring various angles about who should do an appraisal.

14:26.926 --> 14:28.168
And he came to us

14:28.300 --> 14:32.167
amongst other people.

14:32.187 --> 14:42.785
And we had worked with Steve Weissman down valuing the Pforzheimer Library down at the University of Texas.

14:42.886 --> 14:46.512
Bart, Steve and I had done that work together.

14:46.593 --> 14:54.570
And so we thought it was a sensible idea to field a sort of international team again.

14:54.610 --> 15:01.264
So we had Felix from Lathrop Harper, Felix Hoyens, to help us with incunables.

15:01.906 --> 15:02.948
We had...

15:03.552 --> 15:15.194
Steve on English Literature, we had Bart, consultant in-house, then Chris Cooper for autographed manuscripts, and myself.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.061
Well, let me explain.

15:19.142 --> 15:24.632
We proposed this at the same time very much aware that

15:24.950 --> 15:33.363
that we were involving ourselves, and we knew, we said, heavens above, maybe we're backing the wrong horse here.

15:33.383 --> 15:35.506
But on the other hand... Then we wouldn't know what you mean.

15:35.586 --> 15:43.819
Well, by that, we didn't know if we valued a collection for Michael Davis.

15:44.002 --> 15:45.845
Had you ever heard of Michael Davis before?

15:45.865 --> 15:49.349
No, but we then heard about him pretty quickly.

15:49.369 --> 15:55.137
Prior to that, your understanding was that the garden was haven no more.

15:55.157 --> 16:01.426
No, I mean, the garden was haven no more.

16:01.446 --> 16:05.892
There'd been constant speculation as to how he bought it.

16:05.872 --> 16:12.122
because he actually got to know Arthur Houghton and thought he was a little crazy.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.026
He got to know Arthur Houghton?

16:15.046 --> 16:20.555
Yes, because Houghton was the principal buyer at Arthur Houghton's sale.

16:20.575 --> 16:25.763
Houghton swept whatever he wanted from Houghton.

16:25.963 --> 16:30.630
That's what made the garden sale so magnificent.

16:31.066 --> 16:36.542
to those open coffees coming back again, and other things that Haven had put in as well.

16:36.843 --> 16:38.427
As a result of that, he got to meet Arthur.

16:38.829 --> 16:39.671
He got to meet Arthur.

16:39.691 --> 16:41.717
He went down to meet Arthur, yeah.

16:42.068 --> 16:46.294
Would you say that that made Haven a major book collector in everyone's eyes?

16:46.334 --> 16:47.075
What do you mean?

16:47.235 --> 16:48.537
Well, in terms of stature.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.099
Statue is very important.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.621
But what did what make him?

16:51.641 --> 16:56.347
That the Holtonson, his success, his triumph at the Holtonson.

16:57.008 --> 17:04.178
Was that basically, in your estimation, his coming out, the emergence as a major collector on the international scene?

17:04.158 --> 17:12.841
He was a major collector, he had major potential before, great potential, and he was a great buyer before.

17:14.485 --> 17:20.361
George Laurie describes him as a common...

17:20.341 --> 17:23.525
A comet that flashes across the sky.

17:24.006 --> 17:25.888
That's his metaphor.

17:25.949 --> 17:28.131
I think George Lowry is incorrect.

17:28.212 --> 17:32.137
Comet takes a long time.

17:32.337 --> 17:36.363
I think he meant meteor, but basically he said comet.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.507
Well, basically, flash across the sky.

17:39.567 --> 17:46.877
Nobody knows where he comes from, but he's a major player to be taken seriously.

17:47.057 --> 17:48.559
Well, people...

17:48.775 --> 17:50.704
But you said you think he's wrong on that.

17:50.724 --> 17:55.748
Well, what I'm trying to say is that his span,

17:57.128 --> 18:05.098
His span was not terribly long-lived, but his span wasn't like Manny's span.

18:05.579 --> 18:18.295
Manny's more like a sort of old-fashioned mortar attacking a town that just comes up and clocks down.

18:20.177 --> 18:23.001
But in the case of Haven O'Moore,

18:23.335 --> 18:30.584
He bought, for example, the Dove's Press Bible envelope, one of three copies known.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.046
He bought that in 1977.

18:32.467 --> 18:34.950
He was a big collector before.

18:35.010 --> 18:40.137
Cotin must have certainly put a stamp on his collection, yes.

18:40.157 --> 18:42.179
But then other things he bought afterwards.

18:42.199 --> 18:44.983
The Yates notebook, this kind of thing.

18:45.123 --> 18:48.027
All these things made him into a...

18:48.226 --> 18:57.217
into a great collector dominating the scene for a much longer period of time than somebody like Manny or George Abrams.

18:58.239 --> 19:02.204
Well of course Manny is selling his stuff by choice.

19:02.925 --> 19:08.732
Haven's quote, I can't tell you where I got the quote, but he wrote to this person,

19:09.050 --> 19:13.036
He said, they are forcing me to sell my children into slavery.

19:13.056 --> 19:15.961
He did not want to disclose of this collection.

19:17.043 --> 19:18.285
No, I know that.

19:18.465 --> 19:26.518
But in Matty's case, he is choosing to sell his books because he thinks he can get close to full value for them.

19:26.802 --> 19:29.626
That's why he's not selling any of his art.

19:29.646 --> 19:33.171
That's what he told me a couple weeks ago at lunch.

19:33.391 --> 19:35.495
I don't mean to jump around the block here.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.137
We're losing our focus.

19:37.197 --> 19:44.487
Well, anyway, concerning Haven, let's concentrate on Haven.

19:44.648 --> 19:46.971
The chronology of this is then that

19:47.035 --> 19:50.579
Let's not neglect his meeting with Arthur Houghton.

19:50.599 --> 19:52.362
I thought he was a little bad, you said.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.304
Yeah.

19:54.404 --> 20:04.997
I thought he was not the sort of person... Arthur Houghton found him insufferable.

20:05.017 --> 20:06.860
As a show-off.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.444
And slightly crazy in terms of where he was coming from.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.650
which was an air of mystery that Haven always liked to cultivate.

20:14.670 --> 20:22.326
But to go back to our involvement with Haven, we undertook to do the appraisal.

20:22.687 --> 20:30.002
And after that, we were then told that...

20:30.370 --> 20:38.301
our appraisal was going to be accepted as value by both parties.

20:38.941 --> 20:43.067
That's what we'd hoped was going to happen, but we didn't know at the outset.

20:43.828 --> 20:54.522
We agreed to do an appraisal for Michael Davis, but eventually Haven agreed that that appraisal would occur because we also knew that

20:54.502 --> 21:03.252
If Michael Babis had chosen to go ahead with our appraisal and Haven had argued it, he would have then actually got his own appraisal.

21:04.093 --> 21:08.999
And probably that appraisal would have been handled by somebody like Quaritch in London.

21:09.019 --> 21:09.519
Probably.

21:09.579 --> 21:11.802
I'm not sure about that.

21:12.443 --> 21:15.586
And they would have been close in any case, I think.

21:15.606 --> 21:16.427
The appraisal would have been.

21:16.447 --> 21:17.809
I haven't any idea.

21:18.076 --> 21:25.816
I can't say, because you don't know what another appraisal is going to be.

21:25.937 --> 21:26.659
Yeah.

21:26.679 --> 21:29.185
Well, his value is value, I think.

21:29.286 --> 21:30.308
No, I don't think so.

21:30.549 --> 21:32.895
One person values things different from another.

21:33.010 --> 21:42.740
Well, I tell you, do you know what we valued the garden collection at?

21:42.821 --> 21:46.464
I'd say ten million.

21:47.165 --> 21:48.767
Nine.

21:48.847 --> 21:58.617
And we went... We competed very strongly for it.

21:58.637 --> 22:01.060
Why do you think it went to some...

22:01.495 --> 22:02.756
They wrote a large check.

22:06.180 --> 22:08.803
They wrote a large check in advance.

22:11.285 --> 22:30.085
And we went in with our usual pre-1989 argument that if you have a capital involvement in the goods that you sell,

22:30.065 --> 22:34.815
it's potentially damaging to the sale.

22:36.899 --> 22:45.576
And we made this argument, we brought Lord Carrington over, and I was

22:45.910 --> 22:47.732
for this particular marriage?

22:47.852 --> 22:48.713
For this proposal?

22:48.733 --> 22:49.494
Absolutely.

22:49.514 --> 22:50.816
We stayed in Boston together.

22:51.297 --> 22:54.360
Me, my colleague Stephen Lash and Lawrence Harrington.

22:55.281 --> 22:58.986
And we went in.

22:59.006 --> 23:02.330
We were well received by a battery of about 13 lawyers.

23:03.191 --> 23:03.972
From both sides?

23:04.112 --> 23:05.073
From both sides.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.114
From both sides, yeah.

23:06.154 --> 23:07.116
There was a big meeting.

23:07.416 --> 23:09.298
Was Haven and Michael there?

23:09.318 --> 23:10.780
No.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.881
Neither client was there.

23:11.901 --> 23:13.363
Neither client was there.

23:13.944 --> 23:14.905
And we went in.

23:15.374 --> 23:19.561
At one time, and Sotheby's went in at another.

23:20.642 --> 23:22.826
This all would have been around 88, 89?

23:23.246 --> 23:26.632
No, it was around... No.

23:28.094 --> 23:32.681
Yes, you're right.

23:32.701 --> 23:33.062
It was.

23:33.082 --> 23:34.023
It was June or July.

23:34.063 --> 23:34.644
That's right.

23:34.725 --> 23:36.187
It was June or July 89.

23:36.628 --> 23:39.372
You're absolutely right.

23:39.392 --> 23:40.133
And also...

23:40.720 --> 23:45.026
And I phoned up Bob Pirrie to give him the news.

23:45.126 --> 23:46.668
I heard the news when I was in Vermont.

23:47.289 --> 24:01.429
I was stunned by the news because it seemed to me that the only people that

24:01.915 --> 24:05.563
Sotheby's were sucking it to with a martin second.

24:06.084 --> 24:11.897
They were shooting martins in the foot by having gardened.

24:12.097 --> 24:14.623
And the martinsale, no it came at the beginning.

24:15.124 --> 24:17.629
The martinsale was damaging to the

24:17.812 --> 24:20.578
The Martinsale was damaged by the Gardner prices.

24:22.421 --> 24:26.509
Why do you say that?

24:26.650 --> 24:27.812
Why do I say that?

24:27.832 --> 24:30.958
Did they offer competing things, competitive types of things?

24:31.479 --> 24:32.762
Well, you attended those sales, didn't you?

24:32.842 --> 24:35.888
I did, but I mean... Did you look at the cattle then?

24:35.868 --> 24:37.329
I have all the catalogs.

24:37.550 --> 24:42.034
Well, if you look at the catalogs, you see there was a lot of duplication.

24:42.715 --> 24:54.686
I think part of the deal with the court was you had to think, I think they had to sell when they did.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.789
I don't think there was any choice.

24:57.809 --> 24:59.391
Yeah, I agree.

24:59.611 --> 25:05.277
So therefore, I'm saying, well, I understand, but we could certainly compete with him.

25:05.317 --> 25:05.757
Couldn't we?

25:06.175 --> 25:07.717
because we weren't holding them together.

25:07.737 --> 25:09.499
Yeah, that's right.

25:10.520 --> 25:17.889
But they were lured in, the lawyers were lured in by a large cheque, which showed... A cheque means what?

25:17.909 --> 25:20.131
This is a guarantee against... No, not a guarantee.

25:20.332 --> 25:22.674
No, just an advance of money, yes.

25:22.774 --> 25:31.685
How much did you... Have you heard that it... I heard it was $4.5 million, half the appraisal.

25:32.005 --> 25:33.227
Not bad.

25:33.847 --> 25:36.030
Were you prepared to give any advance at all?

25:36.601 --> 25:42.968
If we'd been asked to, we wouldn't have been referred to, but we went out of the starting blocks advising against it.

25:44.751 --> 25:45.592
You see?

25:45.612 --> 25:50.057
Which was our policy, which was our policy prior to 1989.

25:50.077 --> 25:52.980
It was company policy.

25:53.181 --> 25:58.727
I'm not saying that there have not been exceptions prior to 1989.

25:58.859 --> 26:05.067
When we've not given an answer, I'm not saying that at all.

26:05.087 --> 26:15.181
What I'm saying is that we have always done second to our competitors when it came to inventive money matters.

26:15.201 --> 26:17.644
And it's no coincidence, therefore,

26:17.827 --> 26:28.941
that we were not approached by Richard Manning for the sale of these things and also I have heard from someone that he still owes money on the failure.

26:29.601 --> 26:35.529
It is now Tuesday the 24th of September.

26:38.492 --> 26:42.417
Why haven't we seen a catalogue of the Manning sale yet?

26:42.633 --> 26:44.496
You know, it hasn't been in the New York Times.

26:44.556 --> 26:47.600
Do you think it might be something to do with the estimates?

26:48.201 --> 26:48.922
I don't know.

26:49.062 --> 26:55.931
I've asked, and I intend, when we're done, by the way, to even take a ride over there, just to stop in and say hello.

26:55.951 --> 26:57.293
The proofs have been out for a long time.

26:57.834 --> 26:58.315
Yeah, I don't know.

26:58.335 --> 27:08.809
I wonder if, when you said to me earlier on that, when you said to me earlier on today that he believes...

27:09.211 --> 27:17.369
that he's selling, that you believe he's selling books because he's not touching his art because he thinks he's going to get near to full value.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.295
That's what he said.

27:20.375 --> 27:22.801
Well, I'm saying that's your quote.

27:22.821 --> 27:27.451
Well, one wonders therefore where the estimates will be fixed.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.295
That's what Martin Balber Irish is.

27:29.444 --> 27:38.258
It's all in the newspapers.

27:38.278 --> 27:41.883
I believe, by the way, that he owes them a hell of a lot more than 1.1 million.

27:41.984 --> 27:44.748
Well, that's what one would understand.

27:44.808 --> 27:56.987
I read the transcript very carefully and... He's your man who would know because Ralph's forte and the man with him deemed failing.

27:57.490 --> 28:26.620
they're involved in american furniture and i believe that richard manny's biggest passion after books or conjunct or is well is american furniture um and he's not selling any of the art he's not selling any of the furniture and he maintains because he said he would if he thought if he could get full value has he sold his house his house is for sale he hasn't sold it

28:27.089 --> 28:32.895
I'm invited to go down there and look at the empty shelves, which I will do shortly.

28:32.915 --> 28:40.022
It says the house is 30,000 square feet.

28:40.042 --> 28:41.303
I can't imagine.

28:41.623 --> 28:43.185
That's what Jim Cummins told me.

28:43.905 --> 28:49.170
I can't imagine a 30,000.

28:49.190 --> 28:50.191
In Irvington on Hudson.

28:50.231 --> 28:56.978
Well, he said to me,

28:57.228 --> 29:00.152
Don't forget, we're selling on November the 27th in London.

29:01.514 --> 29:06.401
A copy of the 36-line Bible.

29:06.502 --> 29:11.188
And the last time a copy of that book came up for sale was 1789.

29:11.369 --> 29:20.041
There's no copy in this country.

29:20.101 --> 29:23.286
There are 13 copies known in the world, including this one.

29:23.536 --> 29:30.285
as opposed to 48 copies known of the Gutenberg, and 21 copies of the Gutenberg known of Hertha.

29:31.667 --> 29:46.727
This copy of the book is a fragment of two-thirds of the book, B-36 as we call it, but the interesting thing is the last copy to come up, which is owned this particular piece or part of it, at the Pinelli sale in 1789.

29:47.588 --> 29:52.294
So therefore, E-A-N-E-L-L-I, so therefore Brinley couldn't have it,

29:52.730 --> 29:55.093
Morgan couldn't have it.

29:55.113 --> 29:57.016
Ho couldn't have it.

29:57.036 --> 30:00.160
And Huntingdon couldn't have it.

30:00.501 --> 30:02.063
Isn't that wonderful?

30:03.165 --> 30:05.308
I was worth going to England for, isn't it?

30:05.348 --> 30:17.204
Well, it's a very... In pure bibliophile terms, it's a real landmark, because none of those people... We didn't enjoy it.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.648
Thank you.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.011
And...

30:21.991 --> 30:27.057
It was a wonderful reduction, wasn't it?

30:27.257 --> 30:34.586
The reduction of the... We have coffee or something?

30:34.806 --> 30:41.574
We're talking about Salem in London on the 27th.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.236
Yeah, that's the November of the 27th.

30:44.438 --> 30:49.604
Well, I mean, that's the really big thing that you know.

30:49.704 --> 30:50.665
What I...

30:51.758 --> 31:12.687
In May 1977, Christy's book was happening in New York, came out of the sharding blocks, where the world record price had auctioned for a printed book, $320,000.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.002
for Audubon's Birds of America.

31:16.323 --> 31:24.936
In November 1977, we beat our own world record with another copy of Audubon's Birds of America for $360,000.

31:25.116 --> 31:36.934
And then in April 1978, we afflicted them all with a copy of the Gutenberg Bible from the General Theological Seminary.

31:37.775 --> 31:39.097
It made $2 million.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.020
All these are hammer prices.

31:41.253 --> 31:47.966
At that time, nothing printed exceeded the price of $404,000.

31:48.888 --> 31:58.167
Paid for the Corn Leary Declaration of Independence at Freemans in 1969.

31:58.187 --> 32:02.215
And I was tickering around with reserve prices of $1.5 million.

32:03.005 --> 32:06.409
which nobody had ever done before.

32:07.391 --> 32:22.330
Then we held that world record until October the 22nd, 1987, when we beat it twice in the same sale with the Dahini Volume 1, Gutenberg 5.

32:23.525 --> 32:29.815
and with a block that made 2.2 million.

32:30.076 --> 32:35.886
Are these world records important?

32:36.186 --> 32:42.857
Only in as much as some people like to hear.

32:45.261 --> 32:48.807
I don't think there's anybody around now

32:49.428 --> 32:54.177
with the same stature as a collector of, say, Robert Ho or J.P.

32:55.480 --> 32:55.700
Morgan.

32:56.221 --> 33:07.363
These have all basically been on your watch, I would say, right?

33:08.725 --> 33:09.166
I'm sorry?

33:09.186 --> 33:12.212
All of these great sales have basically come on your watch.

33:12.580 --> 33:15.703
Yes, the ones I just mentioned.

33:15.763 --> 33:21.167
Sure, they have, and that's important, I think.

33:21.387 --> 33:38.302
And also, I feel very fortunate to have been able to handle two Gutenberg Bibles and the sale of them.

33:38.842 --> 33:42.165
Did you have any, speaking of two Gutenbergs, one of which was the Doheny,

33:42.837 --> 34:08.592
uh did you have any this is this is a one of these serendipitous questions but any dealings with the uh with the church in la on this did they ever give any indication of why they were selling the library yeah i mean yeah yeah well yeah they gave indications so they they the sale was handled by somebody called jerry lynch

34:08.572 --> 34:12.536
He's a monsignor, I think.

34:12.556 --> 34:16.260
No, Gerry Lynch has nothing to do with the church whatsoever.

34:16.501 --> 34:24.109
He used to work for Ford, the Ford who died recently.

34:24.910 --> 34:27.673
Ford who was with Sotheby's as an advisor.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.375
Remember, what was the man's name?

34:30.156 --> 34:31.457
The famous Ford.

34:31.943 --> 34:33.965
The head of the Ford Motor Company.

34:34.025 --> 34:34.486
Oh, Henry.

34:34.626 --> 34:36.148
Henry Ford, that's right.

34:36.468 --> 34:36.988
Henry Ford.

34:37.009 --> 34:38.610
He used to work for Henry Ford.

34:38.630 --> 34:38.971
That's right.

34:38.991 --> 34:40.953
He used to work for Henry Ford.

34:40.973 --> 34:51.504
Jerry Lynch would now be over 90, and he's a pillar of the church in the sense that he's a layman who's a great developed Catholic, but he's very much a businessman.

34:52.125 --> 34:58.592
Jerry Lynch, in one week, in 1986, made two telephone calls.

34:58.943 --> 35:04.999
One was to Christie's LA and the other was to Sutherland's LA.

35:05.019 --> 35:09.511
And he spoke to a girl called Hilary Holland in our LA office.

35:10.453 --> 35:11.957
And in 1985...

35:12.376 --> 35:13.978
When I was out in L.A.

35:14.319 --> 35:23.373
with the Bibliophiles, the International Bibliophiles, Hillary had just started there from New York.

35:23.393 --> 35:26.858
And I said, look, you know, do you ever hear from Doheny and Trump?

35:26.878 --> 35:31.264
Do you ever hear from Doheny and Trump?

35:31.284 --> 35:36.272
And Jerry Lynch just called up and he said, out of the woodwind.

35:36.292 --> 35:39.717
Yeah, he just said, my name's Gerald Lynch, the expert firm.

35:40.118 --> 35:54.159
And I'm an advisor to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and I'm handling the sales of the Bohemian treasure, the library and everything else.

35:54.259 --> 35:56.723
And I want you to come down to my office to see me.

35:56.823 --> 36:00.309
And she froze a flash and everything else inside.

36:00.329 --> 36:03.874
I was in Germany in 86.

36:04.755 --> 36:07.780
She called her boss, Stephen Lash, in...

36:07.979 --> 36:18.215
New York, and he said, why don't you postpone that jewellery appointment that you've got to do, and go see this guy.

36:18.335 --> 36:20.458
And Sotheby's were equally on the ball as well.

36:21.099 --> 36:23.663
And the thing started just like that.

36:23.683 --> 36:30.173
And what had happened was around the wall of the treasure room,

36:30.440 --> 36:56.700
in the seminary was a remington mural that should be removed from chester place where she used to live because she moved out of chester moved the things out of chester place when she gave them to the church and the big library was put up the top floor of the library two-story building was the treasure room there was a mural by remington around the wall

36:57.035 --> 37:01.254
In 1985, I noticed a talk to Tom Langer of the Huntington.

37:01.274 --> 37:04.750
When I was up there with the Woodley class, I said, Tom, what's with the mural?

37:05.287 --> 37:09.190
It was a colour photograph by this time.

37:09.270 --> 37:14.295
You know, just like those photographs in the Hyde rooms at Harvard, you know, photographs of masters.

37:14.395 --> 37:16.397
You could tell if it was a photograph if you were.

37:16.757 --> 37:17.678
Look carefully.

37:18.258 --> 37:25.965
What had happened was that they had it insured for $4 million.

37:26.225 --> 37:29.508
The church was offered some sum of money, I forget which.

37:29.548 --> 37:34.112
They were about to sell the thing for the sum of money offered.

37:34.497 --> 37:37.363
And Jerry Lynch just stayed.

37:37.684 --> 37:38.405
Stay on.

37:39.848 --> 37:42.654
Why don't you let me ask for double?

37:42.975 --> 37:45.180
And you know what happened?

37:45.360 --> 37:47.284
They get it.

37:47.344 --> 37:48.507
He did and they got it.

37:48.547 --> 37:50.090
And that's why he made the call.

37:50.110 --> 37:53.738
And there was no...

37:53.988 --> 37:59.235
Jerry was not a paid person.

37:59.676 --> 38:05.504
Jerry, I'm sure, he's a senior man.

38:06.105 --> 38:07.307
A very senior man.

38:07.888 --> 38:09.330
And he's very, very devout.

38:09.350 --> 38:14.817
He's a widower, but I think he may have married again.

38:14.837 --> 38:16.820
He lives in L.A.?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.122
He lives in L.A.?

38:17.721 --> 38:18.122
?

38:18.305 --> 38:19.347
And Gerald Lynch.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.528
Gerald Lynch.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.031
You never know, do you?

38:22.051 --> 38:23.673
Gerald Lynch, you can ask Bart about him.

38:24.234 --> 38:26.217
We all know him.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.919
You never know what you can get with a book.

38:28.060 --> 38:28.681
He's great.

38:28.701 --> 38:29.983
Gerald Lynch is great.

38:30.183 --> 38:38.375
And anyway, the thing was that he basically, he ground us to peace.

38:38.395 --> 38:40.699
Well, did he demand up front money the way he did?

38:40.719 --> 38:40.959
No, no, no.

38:40.979 --> 38:42.361
He put everything.

38:42.582 --> 38:44.024
Everything.

38:44.044 --> 38:46.427
We could have offered him up for our money.

38:46.447 --> 38:47.569
We could have done everything.

38:47.802 --> 38:53.630
It was just down, down in the dirt, competition.

38:53.710 --> 38:54.111
Just competition.

38:54.171 --> 39:00.119
Well, you must take terrific pride in the fact that you beat out Selfies.

39:00.139 --> 39:01.181
That must be in the police.

39:01.201 --> 39:05.547
Yes, but I'll tell you something, in hindsight.

39:06.308 --> 39:10.454
This is where competition doesn't help you.

39:10.494 --> 39:14.620
What would have been better?

39:14.937 --> 39:26.663
would have been, if we'd have sold what we normally sell, what we normally do best, and I can honestly say the same for Sotheby's New York too.

39:26.683 --> 39:30.752
Sotheby's New York and Christie's New York.

39:30.901 --> 39:35.066
do not generally sell tons of books in lots.

39:35.246 --> 39:42.776
And when Sotheby's does it, it's pretty disastrous.

39:42.836 --> 39:46.040
Because basically their buyers don't expect that.

39:46.881 --> 39:54.310
What we should have done with Doheny where there were tons and tons and tons of cheap books, we should have had those in a secondary auction house.

39:54.745 --> 39:59.737
But when you're competing with somebody like Gerry, this is not something you can tell him.

39:59.757 --> 40:03.886
Because the other side says, oh, Christie's doesn't want it all.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.270
Wouldn't you love to have it?

40:05.290 --> 40:08.156
Yeah, but do you think you'd earn more money in that the other way?

40:08.638 --> 40:10.903
I mean, you did close to $40 million on that.

40:11.003 --> 40:11.404
I think...

40:11.772 --> 40:15.360
I think the church would have made more money.

40:15.380 --> 40:15.961
They really did.

40:16.302 --> 40:18.006
Yes.

40:18.026 --> 40:18.627
Yes.

40:18.647 --> 40:28.228
Because all those items that we sold in the Camarillo sale, and we had basically three cattlemen.

40:28.208 --> 40:33.815
But if I can describe them for a second.

40:34.416 --> 40:35.597
No, forget that one.

40:35.817 --> 40:38.721
Just talking books.

40:38.741 --> 40:44.548
We have three catalogues which have total focus.

40:45.629 --> 40:52.798
The catalog one of Infunibus, the catalog two of manuscripts that we held in Alvin, and the last catalog was William Morris.

40:53.386 --> 40:59.091
If you examine catalogs, you'll find a magnificent thing.

40:59.612 --> 41:09.481
But adding to those things was a real sort of cement around the ankles.

41:09.521 --> 41:11.523
Tons and tons of bulk.

41:13.565 --> 41:22.093
And the tons and tons of bulk costs us time and money, and we bundled it up into great big lumps.

41:22.242 --> 41:33.756
And basically, a lesser auction house such as Square, or Christie's South Kensington, or a local auction area there, could have sold those things as individual books.

41:34.777 --> 41:42.166
I mean, hey, you walk into South of East or Christie's this afternoon with a $1,500 book and see what you get.

41:42.186 --> 41:44.028
Do you know what you're going to get?

41:44.068 --> 41:44.649
Sorry.

41:44.709 --> 41:45.550
Sorry.

41:46.154 --> 41:47.616
That's right.

41:47.636 --> 41:51.740
Which brings me back to... I mean, you look at what it costs.

41:51.840 --> 41:55.163
I look at all the personnel in there and I see this.

41:55.183 --> 41:58.187
Can I ask you another one?

41:58.227 --> 42:01.350
Can you lend me $1,500 now?

42:01.390 --> 42:03.752
Well, exactly.

42:03.893 --> 42:06.115
It's the sum of money, isn't it?

42:06.215 --> 42:08.257
I can't lend you $1,500 either.

42:09.298 --> 42:10.980
It's a large sum of money.

42:11.416 --> 42:26.734
And if you talk to the person down the road where you live, or I talk to somebody in Hawaii where my daughter aged 11 lives, or I talk to my daughter aged 11 about $1,500, it is a tensile sum of money.

42:26.754 --> 42:39.870
And we are now at the stage in our lives when Christie's and Santa Claus say $2.500, which is a strange state of affairs, which brings me back

42:40.154 --> 42:42.898
in a nice little circle about this very matter.

42:43.038 --> 42:54.514
That is why the garden sale is a greater sale than Street, than Doheny, than Martin.

42:54.534 --> 42:57.698
It's greater for all points of view.

42:57.899 --> 43:00.302
You get it in July, you sell it in November.

43:00.422 --> 43:03.106
You smile.

43:03.126 --> 43:06.371
You get it in July, you sell it in November.

43:06.391 --> 43:08.153
You get Martin,

43:08.926 --> 43:15.076
That's what they must have had with Martin.

43:15.257 --> 43:17.200
And also 314 watts.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.264
That's all we're talking.

43:19.464 --> 43:24.873
They did it on Thursday night, three sessions.

43:24.893 --> 43:26.195
One, two, three, in and out.

43:26.336 --> 43:26.856
One catalog.

43:27.117 --> 43:29.281
One catalog run.

43:30.543 --> 43:31.064
Clean.

43:31.084 --> 43:33.187
Fast and clean, right?

43:33.267 --> 43:33.668
The best.

43:34.120 --> 43:34.663
Nice.

43:34.845 --> 43:36.314
The best.

43:36.334 --> 43:38.950
Hope magnificent collection.

43:39.233 --> 44:05.410
few things few things not so good haven didn't buy those people for good stuff um how well did you get to know hey very well is there something you can talk to me about job and all well you know you can go as far as private you can go as far as you think prudent no i mean

44:06.115 --> 44:07.597
How did you get to know him?

44:07.617 --> 44:08.718
That's how I got to know him.

44:08.738 --> 44:09.239
I got to know him.

44:09.259 --> 44:12.262
It's a very good story.

44:13.224 --> 44:15.166
We had... I've heard of him.

44:16.608 --> 44:21.614
We had the General Theological Seminary Gutenberg Bible on view at Christie's.

44:22.435 --> 44:28.562
As you know, with Christie's viewings, we have a label in every copy of the catalogue, viewings by appointment only.

44:29.143 --> 44:35.751
And I got a phone call somewhere around about 11 o'clock that there was a man downstairs demanding

44:36.052 --> 44:44.383
not asking, demanding, to see the Gutenberg Bible.

44:44.403 --> 44:45.424
I love people like that.

44:45.504 --> 44:47.046
I used to love them more than I love them now.

44:47.106 --> 44:47.887
I'm a bit soft.

44:47.967 --> 44:50.671
I was tough when I was 32.

44:50.691 --> 44:54.216
I said, oh, he's demanding.

44:54.236 --> 44:57.119
He said, well, I'd love to go and see him.

44:57.139 --> 45:01.485
And here was this man, very neatly dressed, on his own,

45:01.718 --> 45:12.370
and he wheeled around at me and said

45:12.653 --> 45:17.439
I want to see this book, and I said, I'm sorry, you can't see this book without an appointment.

45:17.819 --> 45:20.442
He said, do you know who I am?

45:20.682 --> 45:26.569
And I said, no, I haven't got the slightest idea, but I'm Stephen Massey, and I'm pleased to meet you.

45:26.589 --> 45:35.239
And he said, I am Abraham Moore, and I said, well, as I just said, I'm Stephen Massey, and I'm pleased to meet you.

45:35.259 --> 45:36.340
Have you anything else to say?

45:36.501 --> 45:37.922
Have you heard of him prior to that?

45:37.942 --> 45:38.543
Of course I've heard of him.

45:38.708 --> 45:45.464
And if the book's good enough, they come back, they crawl.

45:45.765 --> 45:46.827
Unless they're foolish.

45:47.950 --> 45:52.079
But if they really want the book, they play by the rules.

45:52.180 --> 45:55.367
So we've got friends.

45:55.347 --> 45:57.030
We became friendly.

45:57.110 --> 46:03.379
But he didn't buy it, did he?

46:04.481 --> 46:06.985
No, he did not buy it.

46:07.145 --> 46:07.886
Was he in it?

46:07.966 --> 46:14.416
I think he meant it.

46:14.476 --> 46:19.844
Did he buy it by himself or did he use an agent?

46:19.864 --> 46:20.585
What do you mean?

46:20.605 --> 46:21.827
Well, did he use...

46:21.807 --> 46:24.009
an agent to buy for him at these sales?

46:24.029 --> 46:26.352
Did he buy... No, he always used an agent.

46:26.372 --> 46:27.793
I mean, he'd often be with the agent.

46:28.634 --> 46:32.097
He was with Warren Howell at the sale.

46:32.197 --> 46:37.983
He was with Warren Howell at the General Theological Seminary sale.

46:38.624 --> 46:43.108
He was with Warren Howell, and Warren Howell was the underbidder.

46:43.128 --> 46:44.610
Warren was the underbidder of the sale.

46:45.311 --> 46:47.913
Now, whether that means, I don't know.

46:48.073 --> 46:48.774
We don't know that.

46:48.794 --> 46:49.855
Warren is now deceased.

46:50.095 --> 46:51.116
Warren is deceased.

46:51.136 --> 46:51.797
Yeah.

46:52.233 --> 47:01.652
Would you say that, don't I breathe a sigh of relief, that the Gartenstale didn't have a Gutenberg rival.

47:01.692 --> 47:02.954
Two vols.

47:03.034 --> 47:03.615
Complete.

47:03.636 --> 47:05.960
Don't I breathe a sigh of relief.

47:06.421 --> 47:13.515
Then, you would have had one more lap, and it would have made 31 million.

47:13.495 --> 47:14.416
Why not?

47:14.516 --> 47:14.897
Fifteen?

47:14.917 --> 47:15.517
More?

47:15.537 --> 47:17.760
Do you have fifteen for them?

47:17.780 --> 47:21.424
Well, they went sixteen for the day.

47:21.444 --> 47:23.927
Sixteen.

47:24.868 --> 47:25.930
Do you buy books?

47:25.950 --> 47:26.590
Yes.

47:26.711 --> 47:27.371
Yes.

47:27.451 --> 47:29.294
Got any books in two bowls?

47:30.515 --> 47:31.676
I think it's the same.

47:31.716 --> 47:39.626
What I'm saying is if you've got a book in two bowls that costs you five thousand dollars, how much would you pay for volume one of them?

47:39.646 --> 47:41.528
If you buy it at all.

47:41.508 --> 47:44.072
There's no way out.

47:45.455 --> 47:46.536
The Doheny Vol.

47:46.577 --> 47:48.760
1 was the finest copy of Vol.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.784
1 you'd ever see.

47:51.044 --> 47:53.789
But would you buy Vol.

47:53.809 --> 47:55.732
1 of Gulliver's Travel?

47:56.874 --> 47:59.458
Large paper, pristine, uncut.

47:59.478 --> 48:00.840
I know of such a copy.

48:00.861 --> 48:02.383
My father used to have it.

48:02.403 --> 48:02.924
But it's Vol.

48:02.944 --> 48:03.224
1.

48:03.805 --> 48:05.929
No wonder my father still had it.

48:06.196 --> 48:08.487
never sold it, just a nice object.

48:08.507 --> 48:09.351
But what's it worth?

48:10.577 --> 48:12.325
Is it worth Manny's

48:12.760 --> 48:22.755
Two volumes that hung around for a long time at Harry Levenson and at Quarrett and was bought at the Sion College sale in 77.

48:25.439 --> 48:38.498
I'm not giving you an estimate of 15 million on the garden sale, but in the garden sale... In the garden sale, prices the way they were, perfect Gutenberg Bible, that night, what do you think?

48:38.663 --> 48:41.208
And people were of a mind to spend money.

48:41.288 --> 48:44.735
They were spending money that night.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.137
It was quite a night, wasn't it?

48:46.157 --> 48:49.464
Manny himself spent... Thank you.

48:49.544 --> 48:49.925
No?

48:49.965 --> 48:50.606
Not for me.

48:50.666 --> 48:51.187
No.

48:51.488 --> 48:55.255
Manny himself spent... Over...

48:55.454 --> 48:57.876
two times the value on a book that wasn't worth half.

48:58.077 --> 49:05.304
2.1 million of work that Shakespeare, not even in their original bindings.

49:05.324 --> 49:11.329
I mean, I saw the Shakespeare... We weren't kidding around.

49:11.690 --> 49:14.633
We had Steve, Felix, myself, Bart.

49:15.213 --> 49:20.158
We had some fairly decent minds on that appraisal.

49:20.458 --> 49:24.162
And we came in at $400,000 on the set.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.105
What were they paid once the $265,000?

49:27.125 --> 49:27.746
Well, yeah.

49:27.766 --> 49:28.547
They gave the pros.

49:29.148 --> 49:29.549
$200,000.

49:29.569 --> 49:31.411
$200,000, yeah.

49:31.451 --> 49:33.635
$200,000, yeah.

49:33.655 --> 49:35.137
$200,000.

49:35.197 --> 49:36.098
My memory of it.

49:37.901 --> 49:39.563
We reckoned it at $400,000.

49:40.966 --> 49:44.290
It certainly was... All the money's on volume one.

49:44.310 --> 49:45.332
Of course.

49:45.392 --> 49:46.233
We all know that.

49:46.654 --> 49:50.440
The last copy up was the Webster copy, which was a damn good copy.

49:50.840 --> 49:51.782
Mags underbid it.

49:51.982 --> 49:54.165
Fleming buys it and sends it to Japan.

49:54.382 --> 49:55.864
And, of course, there's new levels.

49:56.465 --> 49:58.288
We know there are new levels, but it's not.

49:58.608 --> 50:00.371
It's not a $2 million set.

50:00.391 --> 50:03.315
However... Who is the underbidder, though?

50:03.335 --> 50:04.016
Who is an underbidder?

50:05.037 --> 50:05.959
Small, I think.

50:06.079 --> 50:07.641
Small, in Washington.

50:07.661 --> 50:07.982
Really?

50:08.142 --> 50:08.983
I think so, yeah.

50:09.003 --> 50:10.385
I mean, doesn't that surprise you?

50:10.485 --> 50:12.708
It's not a $2 million set yet.

50:12.748 --> 50:15.252
There's an underbidder who pushes it into $2 million.

50:15.352 --> 50:16.995
But Small's an autograph collector.

50:17.055 --> 50:22.903
He's never bothered to get any sound advice except from an auction house about what he buys.

50:23.947 --> 50:26.673
I mean, do you think Small will be in this time?

50:26.813 --> 50:28.256
I haven't got any idea.

50:28.276 --> 50:30.301
Depends who's advising him.

50:30.321 --> 50:35.412
If he's advised by Sotheby's, he'd better be there.

50:35.833 --> 50:38.158
Small was said to be the other bit around these things.

50:39.421 --> 50:44.566
I think you could say that Small is almost certainly the underbidder.

50:44.586 --> 50:44.966
Really?

50:44.986 --> 50:45.086
Yeah.

50:45.106 --> 50:50.571
Why would he be going after the folios all of a sudden if he was not a red folios?

50:51.612 --> 50:55.636
Because he bought a declaration of independence?

50:55.656 --> 50:58.879
So he's collecting a housewife's big tag.

50:58.899 --> 50:59.919
I have no idea.

50:59.939 --> 51:00.280
I don't know.

51:00.300 --> 51:03.182
But I know he's got a declaration of independence.

51:03.202 --> 51:06.405
I'm almost certain that he was the underbidder on the set of folios.

51:06.646 --> 51:09.428
And I do know that he bought a set of signers.

51:09.408 --> 51:12.433
So I know he collects autographs.

51:12.453 --> 51:16.459
Let's get back to Hayden.

51:20.185 --> 51:21.287
You get to know him pretty well.

51:21.647 --> 51:25.413
Very well, I know.

51:25.473 --> 51:27.096
You get to be a social...

51:27.447 --> 51:30.131
kind of a thing, come over for dinner, I guess.

51:30.311 --> 51:32.814
No, we never actually had dinner at my apartment.

51:32.834 --> 51:32.894
No.

51:32.914 --> 51:33.555
You're smiling.

51:33.575 --> 51:37.020
Well, you know why I'm smiling, and I'm not going to say.

51:37.160 --> 51:42.407
If I were to report that, would I be in error?

51:42.467 --> 51:42.968
Report what?

51:43.589 --> 51:47.034
What I report about the groupings at your apartment.

51:47.074 --> 51:47.675
Who was there?

51:48.295 --> 51:49.377
A number of people.

51:49.397 --> 51:49.557
Who?

51:49.958 --> 51:50.498
You tell me.

51:50.538 --> 51:52.922
You tell me who was there.

51:53.222 --> 51:54.243
I don't know.

51:54.264 --> 51:54.744
I can't tell you.

51:54.804 --> 51:56.226
You can't tell me who was there.

51:56.246 --> 51:56.847
No.

51:57.299 --> 52:00.264
Why not?

52:00.284 --> 52:01.105
You can't tell me.

52:01.285 --> 52:09.479
Well, if you don't know, then how... How many sources?

52:10.480 --> 52:12.944
Two, sir.

52:14.186 --> 52:15.949
Well, one of your sources was Bach.

52:15.929 --> 52:17.351
Because he told so.

52:19.193 --> 52:23.820
But... I would never say... But who was the other source?

52:23.840 --> 52:26.944
Because the thing is that... I know exactly who was there.

52:27.264 --> 52:36.477
Well, I can comment if you let me know who else was there.

52:36.737 --> 52:40.502
Because the fact is that I know exactly who was there.

52:40.482 --> 52:43.234
And I need to... Was that my father that evening?

52:43.254 --> 52:44.279
Yeah, I'd love to.

52:44.299 --> 52:44.540
Okay, fine.

52:44.560 --> 52:45.605
There was Haven and Moore.

52:45.625 --> 52:46.288
There was my wife.

52:47.273 --> 52:48.940
There was Fanny Neville Rose.

52:49.443 --> 52:51.726
And there was Stephen Manson.

52:52.046 --> 52:52.927
That's it.

52:52.947 --> 52:53.668
And Bob.

52:53.988 --> 52:58.974
How the hell does the story get around?

52:59.015 --> 53:01.157
Because it's the book tray.

53:02.078 --> 53:02.899
Turn this thing on.

53:02.999 --> 53:06.263
You said you were very fond of me.

53:06.323 --> 53:07.565
I was very fond of Haven.

53:07.585 --> 53:11.750
I used to see him when he came to New York at fairly frequent intervals.

53:12.331 --> 53:18.798
I'd have lunch with him on his own or with him and with Laurier.

53:18.818 --> 53:19.399
And...

53:19.801 --> 53:27.453
I was upset when he told me his decision that he wanted to sell anyway, that he had to sell.

53:27.873 --> 53:29.796
Did he tell you he had to sell or he wanted to sell?

53:31.078 --> 53:41.995
No, he didn't tell me in so many words, but it was obvious to me that something was up when he expressed some interest in the Doheny one sale.

53:41.975 --> 53:46.520
It was mild interest, and he didn't buy anything.

53:47.221 --> 53:52.186
And I understood that he dropped from sight for a while.

53:52.386 --> 54:00.135
And I and Bart and a number of people wondered what was going on.

54:01.196 --> 54:02.537
Wondered if anything would happen.

54:02.557 --> 54:05.401
We used to sort of joke when the phone rang.

54:05.421 --> 54:08.104
We'd say, hey, it's probably Heyman.

54:08.124 --> 54:10.426
Have you heard from him in the Ralsons Groups?

54:10.446 --> 54:11.307
Yes.

54:11.557 --> 54:28.300
recently or no not recently i i uh he he made a telephone call to me um soon after the sale i've forgotten exactly when um and i saw him at the southerby sale

54:28.280 --> 54:52.937
and he gave me a sort of cordial phone call and he understood how disappointed I was not getting the collection for sale and he asked me on my comments about the sale itself and I said that his modern press books were

54:52.917 --> 54:58.723
They didn't perform well, which they obviously didn't.

54:58.824 --> 55:01.797
But everything else was giant.

55:02.165 --> 55:26.698
Did he ever talk to you about his... Did he think he was the great collector of... The great collector alive, as he told William Shady, I'm the greatest collector of... That's why Shady was... That's what Arthur Houghton found insufferable.

55:26.718 --> 55:30.262
When I said insufferable, that's what Arthur Houghton found insufferable.

55:30.282 --> 55:31.564
Because actually...

55:32.287 --> 55:36.391
As a single collector, Arthur Houghton was far greater.

55:36.411 --> 55:44.700
Bartman should have mentioned this to you, because in terms of range, Arthur Houghton had a Gooseberg Bible, which he bought and sold.

55:45.281 --> 55:54.851
He had the greatest collection of Alice in Wonderland put together in recent times since Eldridge Johnson.

55:54.871 --> 56:00.117
He had a magnificent icebox all bought from...
