WEBVTT

00:03.946 --> 00:05.689
Brainy where it goes.

00:05.709 --> 00:16.065
And I looked at it and I said, Jay, where the doors aren't opening and closing, and they're locking people in or locking people out.

00:16.486 --> 00:20.973
Well, you had a 36-year-old architect who had never done a library before.

00:22.195 --> 00:27.102
And of course, the British Library is just wonderful, on the other hand.

00:27.563 --> 00:30.167
It had been poked at for 30 years.

00:30.267 --> 00:30.628
Right.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.680
But, uh, I'll deal with that.

00:32.740 --> 00:36.403
National libraries, academic libraries, public libraries.

00:38.465 --> 00:43.650
Um, you know, I've spent, uh... So, have you mixed, uh, my good friend Alexander Vatomare in here?

00:44.070 --> 00:44.311
No.

00:44.791 --> 00:45.292
Who is that?

00:45.392 --> 00:50.076
I'll copy something for you.

00:50.116 --> 00:59.485
Nicholas, I guess, Nicholas Alexander Vatomare, V-A-T-T-E-M-A-R-E, was a French ventriloquist.

01:01.439 --> 01:05.567
And he's the man that I really credit with founding the Public Library movement.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.490
I didn't know who he is, yes, okay.

01:08.832 --> 01:24.561
We've had an interesting little correspondence lately with the National Library in France, because we credit him with really being one of the instigators in the founding of the Boston Public Library.

01:25.081 --> 01:30.709
And the first books actually donated to the Boston Public Library were books that he assembled.

01:30.729 --> 01:32.452
And we still have the Vadimir collection.

01:32.612 --> 01:35.677
I always thought it was Tickner and those guys from Harvard.

01:35.737 --> 01:46.573
Well, they were the people who Vadimir assembled to begin with to sell his idea of the exchange of books.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.718
And they began to build on that idea.

01:50.198 --> 01:53.383
But he was really the seed.

01:54.308 --> 01:56.091
So it was a European, actually.

01:56.872 --> 01:57.874
Yeah, in a way it was.

01:58.094 --> 02:04.886
But, you know, it was interesting because he saw this as an idea that was American.

02:04.906 --> 02:05.707
Interesting.

02:05.727 --> 02:07.931
I mean, it wasn't an idea that he planted in France.

02:08.192 --> 02:09.955
Are there some good references on him?

02:09.975 --> 02:11.016
Yeah, there are, actually.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.681
Nancy Quinn, who you need to talk to.

02:14.122 --> 02:15.203
You know John Cole?

02:15.464 --> 02:15.925
Oh, of course.

02:16.185 --> 02:17.568
Well, Nancy Quinn is his wife.

02:17.868 --> 02:20.232
She runs the Smithsonian Libraries.

02:21.089 --> 02:27.318
She's done a lot of research on Vadamar, and his papers actually, I think, are at the New York Public Library.

02:30.463 --> 02:50.151
We have an oil painting out just hanging out here where you were sitting, which was presented to Vadamar in 1839, I think, during really the period of his intense interest in this whole library movement, this whole exchange of books idea here in this part of the world.

02:50.553 --> 02:54.358
I thought I would start this chapter, and I haven't started writing it yet.

02:56.882 --> 03:02.189
I've spent a week in San Francisco, of course, and I think I have an excellent talk to everybody.

03:03.691 --> 03:04.532
Talk to Ken.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.113
Talk to Ken.

03:05.413 --> 03:10.280
And I had a terrific interview with him, actually.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.805
Terrific in terms of, I think, what I was able to get out of him.

03:14.205 --> 03:15.768
You know, I don't have an agenda.

03:15.868 --> 03:16.869
I'm a journalist.

03:16.949 --> 03:19.733
I certainly have a point of view.

03:20.641 --> 03:29.431
But I have to say, that morning, I thought I would start this chapter, actually, on that day that you were observing your 150th anniversary.

03:29.471 --> 03:32.214
This is really the way a big city should do it.

03:32.234 --> 03:33.736
Got that old, beautiful building there.

03:34.457 --> 03:35.418
Got this building here.

03:36.139 --> 03:43.387
We have a community that, I mean, this is an institution as much as the BSO and the Red Sox and the MFA.

03:44.629 --> 03:45.390
And that's not kidding.

03:45.410 --> 03:46.010
That's a fact.

03:47.292 --> 03:50.175
And I don't have to go down the list.

03:50.442 --> 03:50.882
I know it.

03:51.783 --> 03:55.408
But also, you had that flood.

03:55.428 --> 04:03.637
I came here, I arrived, you know, and I saw people really who needed counseling who were working feverishly frantically to save their books.

04:04.257 --> 04:04.538
That's right.

04:04.558 --> 04:09.143
Flash to California, the 1989 earthquake.

04:09.163 --> 04:18.373
Quote, I asked Ken Dolly, did you say that the 1989 earthquake was an opportunity to clean the Aegean stables?

04:20.378 --> 04:27.692
you know, basically comparing books on the floor with what we know is horseshit in the stable.

04:28.694 --> 04:31.079
And he said, well, that quote wasn't original with me.

04:31.139 --> 04:31.820
I said, well, I know it.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.504
I know the problem.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.490
And he said it, you know.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.255
And then he went on to defend that.

04:39.275 --> 04:40.257
Give me your attitude on that.

04:40.277 --> 04:42.842
Well, it's interesting, because I, you know, because

04:43.109 --> 04:45.952
you sort of know the connection between Ken and me.

04:45.972 --> 04:48.294
I'd be coy if I were to tell you I'm not going to ask you about it.

04:48.615 --> 04:52.338
And so this is a good, I guess, segue your beginning point to that.

04:54.401 --> 05:10.517
When I got to the Pikes Peak Library District, which Ken had run for, I don't know, maybe a dozen years or so, I found a library that had a grand reputation for its technology

05:11.290 --> 05:14.615
but not actually as much application as I had hoped to find.

05:16.398 --> 05:37.332
I also found a library serving a major urban city, major urban center, so deficient in its collections of materials that even the grandest of technology couldn't make up for the very lack of substance to a library.

05:40.197 --> 05:50.647
We were able to build a collection from a half a million items to over a million items, I think in six or seven years' time.

05:52.369 --> 05:54.411
I mean, a phenomenal amount of work.

05:55.291 --> 05:56.553
Had he reduced?

05:56.573 --> 05:58.194
I'm sorry, go ahead.

05:58.214 --> 06:01.477
To bring up what I saw as a major deficiency.

06:03.199 --> 06:07.403
I think what he had done for many years was use resources that I thought

06:08.362 --> 06:12.207
And obviously, we would disagree about this if you were here talking with us.

06:13.189 --> 06:29.270
I thought those resources should have been more effectively divided between investing in the new technologies, which I think have an important place in libraries, but maintaining this important and relevant perspective around books and library materials.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.719
I think in this sort of hell-bent lunge forward,

06:37.319 --> 06:57.586
He had sacrificed what is the stock and trade, this enormously important human connection between people and books, between an individual book and an individual person, which I think is still at the very core of what a library is, any kind of library.

07:00.510 --> 07:05.436
On Tuesday, I was at a speaker at a colloquium at Wayne State University.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.448
And Toby Holtzman, who I'm sure you've talked to.

07:09.468 --> 07:10.329
Toby's in my book.

07:10.349 --> 07:10.910
Right, I know.

07:11.490 --> 07:14.433
You just saw him in New York a couple weeks ago, as a matter of fact.

07:15.714 --> 07:20.039
Why don't I shoot a couple pictures while we talk, and then I'll get you behind your desk.

07:20.059 --> 07:22.421
You know, and I love Toby.

07:23.162 --> 07:24.303
He's sick.

07:24.363 --> 07:26.004
He'd really be very intense, though, can't he?

07:26.024 --> 07:26.485
He's intense.

07:26.505 --> 07:26.925
He's intense.

07:27.706 --> 07:34.933
But, you know, the perspective in talking to him about this passion, this connection that individuals have with books,

07:35.993 --> 07:45.488
is part of this connection that goes beyond the words on a page or the images that people see when they read.

07:45.548 --> 07:52.339
This connection to the book as a cultural instrument, a tool.

07:52.820 --> 08:02.676
People look at people who are carpenters and they see the hammer as the instrument of creation for a carpenter.

08:04.411 --> 08:06.573
Well, a book is an instrument of creation also.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.055
People are enriched by books.

08:10.537 --> 08:20.505
It may be enriched by the computer experience as well, but there's nothing like this amazingly very special connection between humans and books.

08:20.526 --> 08:27.272
I don't know what I'm... Even the youngest of kids, I mean even the youngest of children, make this bond.

08:28.873 --> 08:29.834
It's fascinating.

08:29.854 --> 08:31.475
I don't know what I'm calling this new book.

08:32.076 --> 08:34.418
I played it a couple of times.

08:35.191 --> 08:42.479
One, at the moment, is an ingenious cipher, which is what Archibald MacLeach called the book when he was a librarian, of course.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.522
And it might be just a little too... I don't know.

08:45.542 --> 08:45.923
I like it.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.445
My editor thinks it doesn't tell anything.

08:47.465 --> 08:48.045
It doesn't, yeah.

08:48.065 --> 08:51.008
Some people probably wouldn't... It's not a gentleman.

08:52.030 --> 08:52.830
Wouldn't connect to it.

08:53.431 --> 08:55.593
But, you know, I like the... Anyway.

08:56.374 --> 09:03.342
So, when you got to... And, by the way, I gave the keynote address at Jay Trenofsky's Colorado Springs...

09:03.625 --> 09:32.417
book seminar this summer so I did have a chance to go see the library and this is a major which is great now which is great I mean we worked real hard at building the library we're going to talk about some little library out talking about a very large metropolitan area with universities and and we were able to establish that library as a very very important information point and cultural point for the community did the people express

09:32.718 --> 09:36.543
their dissatisfaction of the library when you arrived there?

09:36.563 --> 09:37.564
Oh, yes.

09:37.584 --> 09:46.536
Did they feel like they were being shortchanged in terms of... The number of complaints that I received about the lack of books was simply overwhelming.

09:47.897 --> 09:51.222
In terms of titles, in terms of breadth, in terms of... Everything.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.824
Everything.

09:52.844 --> 10:01.695
I remember the first dinner that I was a speaker at, I had an elderly man come up to me and he said, Mr. Margolis,

10:02.165 --> 10:06.191
If you do nothing here, buy a few books.

10:07.953 --> 10:10.737
If you do nothing else, buy a few books.

10:11.859 --> 10:17.166
Had Dowling reduced the collections, or just not strengthened?

10:17.187 --> 10:19.670
I think for the most part he neglected the collections.

10:21.573 --> 10:23.255
And turned his attention to what the things were.

10:23.275 --> 10:29.404
The resources were refocused on technology.

10:30.008 --> 10:53.417
I think the thrust and expectation was that what a library was was a connection to information, which I see as a narrower purview than the world of knowledge and culture.

10:55.372 --> 11:01.621
The technology did a fair job, but only a fair job, as an information tool and information resource.

11:01.641 --> 11:04.765
Now, let me say, I don't plan to make this a tale of two cities.

11:04.805 --> 11:05.646
Yeah, right.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.770
Well, in some ways it is a tale.

11:08.790 --> 11:10.393
In some ways it is.

11:10.413 --> 11:19.886
And certainly my experience is sort of unique, because I came to Colorado Springs as a bookman.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.308
I consider myself a bookman.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.371
Why don't you expand?

11:23.391 --> 11:25.193
I mean, I'm a librarian, but I'm a bookman.

11:25.409 --> 11:27.071
I mean, I like books.

11:27.171 --> 11:28.433
I collect books personally.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.956
I'm passionate about books.

11:31.376 --> 11:32.778
I mean, I have thousands of books.

11:33.859 --> 11:41.729
I've been in Boston 20 months, and I finally have my library, my bookcases in, and I've been unpacking my books.

11:42.490 --> 11:45.374
Hundreds of boxes of books that I've been sort of without.

11:45.434 --> 11:48.057
They've been in boxes in the attic and the basement and other places.

11:48.237 --> 11:49.399
Tell me a little bit about books.

11:49.419 --> 11:54.505
And I, you know, my interest in books is very eclectic.

11:56.240 --> 12:10.855
I collect everything from books about cowboys to the Shakers, the religious American religious movement.

12:11.136 --> 12:18.283
I collect oddities of all sorts, you know, books on unusual subjects.

12:19.124 --> 12:19.585
Where are you from?

12:20.385 --> 12:21.887
I was born in Greenwich, Connecticut.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.088
So you're from New Islander?

12:23.108 --> 12:23.749
Yeah, a New Islander.

12:24.235 --> 12:25.937
But I lived in Michigan.

12:26.077 --> 12:26.959
I lived in Colorado.

12:28.040 --> 12:28.981
She can give me a CV.

12:29.362 --> 12:30.904
We don't have to go through all of that.

12:31.905 --> 12:52.352
You know, my sense, my connection, you know, is that I have some appreciation for the artistic elements of a book, physical elements of a book, values of collecting, the relative things, and what's in Canubula, what's, you know, medieval, what's,

12:52.872 --> 12:55.236
illuminated, what's fore-edge painting.

12:55.957 --> 13:11.523
I appreciate the book in terms of its reality, in addition to its content, and how books change people's lives, how books influence the world.

13:11.763 --> 13:18.154
The term I like to use is books make people rich.

13:19.130 --> 13:36.052
And take that away in every context, whether it's a book that helps you invest in the stock market, or a book that enriches you spiritually, or a book that gives you a new skill or a talent or a new insight that helps you be more successful.

13:36.272 --> 13:39.036
I don't think I'm going to take the cheap shot and put it in my book.

13:40.418 --> 13:46.926
But I did interview Ken Dowland in his apartment, and I did glance at the books on the shelves.

13:47.412 --> 13:51.676
And there were Reader's Digest condensed books there, just a point of fact.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.581
Ken is not a bookman.

13:56.641 --> 14:01.165
Ken is an information technologist, first and foremost.

14:01.445 --> 14:16.339
And I think it's important when you look at libraries, particularly, and when you look at the world of books, to see that if there is any degradation that I see, and not only the Ken Dallans specifically, but the other Ken Dallans out there,

14:16.842 --> 14:23.789
particularly in the library world, is that is a movement and a trend that is frightening to me.

14:25.191 --> 14:28.574
Because I see, first of all, I see the need for balance.

14:30.216 --> 14:32.619
With any new technologies, there's offsets.

14:33.860 --> 14:41.408
And I don't see, you know, that you should be hell-bent to embrace a new technology and abandon the oldest technology around.

14:42.189 --> 14:46.073
Now, this is pertinent, and it goes beyond the superficial.

14:46.846 --> 15:00.365
I asked Gina Menoudry, who I interviewed before I interviewed, a nice woman, and then I interviewed Dallin, but she said this first, and it was corroborated by Dallin.

15:01.486 --> 15:08.836
I said, do you see the San Francisco Public Library performing the function of a research-depth library?

15:09.096 --> 15:10.238
And they both said no.

15:11.737 --> 15:18.584
Now, we are sitting in one of the great research libraries, public libraries, public or whatever, in the world.

15:18.744 --> 15:19.725
In the world, yes.

15:19.745 --> 15:23.648
And I don't think the city of Boston would be very happy.

15:23.668 --> 15:25.110
37.2 million items.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.951
We are the practitioners.

15:27.012 --> 15:30.455
If you said this is not a research library, you're probably going back to Pikes Peak.

15:30.475 --> 15:30.915
That's right.

15:30.935 --> 15:38.082
We are the practitioners of research library critical mass theory in its ultimate, I mean.

15:38.365 --> 15:40.748
How do you respond to that?

15:40.828 --> 15:45.554
And I don't mean for you to engage in a colloquy with people in San Francisco.

15:45.574 --> 16:00.272
I respond to that, that we are blessed with a history, a 150-year history, of people being thoughtful and visionary in collecting a resource that is second to none.

16:01.033 --> 16:04.117
I had David Hennington working on a project.

16:04.177 --> 16:06.280
He's the former director of the Houston Public Library.

16:07.120 --> 16:14.648
He was in a few weeks ago, and he got a tour of the building, and we stopped to talk, and he was overwhelmed.

16:14.668 --> 16:16.390
He said, I had no idea you had all of this.

16:17.251 --> 16:36.452
And I said, you know, David, the comparison is, if somebody walks into the Houston Public Library looking for a book on a particular subject, or books on a particular subject, they're likely to find in your library, and he's retired, but still referred to his library, they're liable to find maybe 25 books in the Houston Public Library on that subject.

16:37.225 --> 16:43.936
If they come here and ask for the same subject, it'll be 25,000 books that we'll pull off the shelves for them.

16:45.739 --> 16:52.390
This sort of critical mass, which I think is what makes us an amazing institution.

16:52.410 --> 16:56.216
But let's take it to the next... The depth, the depth of our collections.

16:56.236 --> 17:04.870
You see, because this drives to the heart of the role of the public library in the 21st century, or, you know, in the future, whatever,

17:05.390 --> 17:10.776
A lot of people are saying maybe a public library's role is not to be a research facility.

17:11.637 --> 17:23.911
And one of the reasons that they gave out there is that, listen, Berkeley has a wonderful collection, Stanford has a wonderful collection, whatever's out there.

17:23.931 --> 17:28.837
But of course, and if people really need access to this material, they can get it.

17:29.377 --> 17:33.422
And then our job is to do these things for the public.

17:34.128 --> 17:38.553
And here we are, of course, with probably the greatest concentration of books in North America.

17:38.593 --> 17:38.913
That's right.

17:38.933 --> 17:39.273
Isn't that great?

17:39.634 --> 17:43.718
And yet we still have the BPL saying, well, that's fine.

17:43.738 --> 17:49.004
We're delighted that Harvard has this, and all these other places have this, and the Massachusetts Historical Society.

17:49.244 --> 17:51.446
Well, I think there's some important distinctions.

17:51.466 --> 17:57.773
But does the public library, in your view, I guess, maybe you could address yourself to that, have a role in the

17:58.782 --> 18:01.064
Yeah, for the researcher.

18:01.084 --> 18:02.066
It's a critical role.

18:02.106 --> 18:07.411
You know, when we began... And not many public libraries also are in a position to do that either, I think.

18:07.431 --> 18:08.012
That's right.

18:08.112 --> 18:27.793
But our founders in 1848, if you read that first annual report of 1852 that lays out the four categories of things that we should buy, it's clear and very distinct that a critical role and one of the equalizing roles of a public library was to buy resources that no one could afford to buy.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.675
It speaks to this research function.

18:31.715 --> 18:34.559
It speaks to this repository function.

18:34.599 --> 18:43.851
It speaks to the need to buy expensive, important, critical tools that help everybody and level the playing field.

18:44.552 --> 18:53.083
So it doesn't matter if you're Josiah Quincy and can afford to buy anything, or Sally or Joe Slob, who just got off the boat.

18:53.163 --> 18:58.791
Or if I'm Nick Basbings, who can afford to pay $275 for a six-month reading ticket at Widener.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.772
Exactly.

18:59.887 --> 19:28.780
that's the other distinction that is critical harvard is a private library boston university is a private institution boston college is a private institution this is the public institution we're not a university of california that's a public institution we don't have one we have university of massachusetts of boston is the closest that we come to that we also in this city have an interesting connection in my mind higher education is one of the four

19:29.114 --> 19:34.519
leading businesses in our community, as a business generating money.

19:36.561 --> 19:44.309
To have public infrastructure that supports that kind of economic vitality is important.

19:46.551 --> 19:57.282
I think one of the reasons that Boston historically has become, and obviously it was a leading educational city even before the library got here, as Harvard goes back to 16,

19:57.717 --> 19:59.720
38 or whatever.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.101
The dating is 38.

20:01.121 --> 20:02.223
Give or take.

20:02.263 --> 20:02.463
Right.

20:04.446 --> 20:12.016
But one of the reasons that more modern institutions happened, you know, MIT was just a couple blocks from here when it began.

20:13.418 --> 20:16.402
Boston University actually began, I think, right in this corner.

20:17.964 --> 20:25.834
I think one of the reasons that that enterprise developed with such significance in Boston is that we had a public research function.

20:26.607 --> 20:31.833
We had public infrastructure to support those institutions, and we still do that today.

20:32.293 --> 20:35.036
We have 68 institutions of higher learning in Boston.

20:35.897 --> 20:38.880
And I think somebody told me now there's a new college opening.

20:39.441 --> 20:40.842
Maybe it's 69 or 70.

20:40.862 --> 20:42.204
Well, there's that Olin money.

20:43.365 --> 20:43.926
Yes, yes.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.048
And he's not going to have a library, by the way.

20:46.688 --> 20:54.657
Well, even though many of these institutions have libraries, they can't have the richness of the kind of resource that we have.

20:56.105 --> 21:06.175
And so this is public infrastructure, very much like we have a T, or we have roads, that serve to support that whole enterprise.

21:06.456 --> 21:24.694
On the day that you observed your 150th, I don't know whether it was you or John Berry who said this, but one of you, it was one of you who said, if you look at the municipal budget, you look at the percentage of that that is earmarked for the public library, and then you factor in the number of people

21:25.163 --> 21:26.204
benefit from the library.

21:26.464 --> 21:27.525
It's got to be the best deal.

21:29.327 --> 21:30.768
What is your percentage, by the way?

21:30.788 --> 21:32.790
I have no idea.

21:34.352 --> 21:34.992
How much do you get?

21:35.052 --> 21:39.016
I mean, our total resource is about $35 million.

21:40.117 --> 21:42.780
But we get it from different, you know.

21:44.681 --> 21:47.924
You get two and a half million people a year that come in here, approximately.

21:48.685 --> 21:53.770
Are you concerned that the demographics show that

21:54.408 --> 22:01.535
You're not really reaching the 18 to 24 age proofs.

22:01.595 --> 22:03.897
I'm concerned about the Benton study.

22:03.917 --> 22:08.401
Actually, my colloquium speech at Wayne State this week was at the public library dead.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.583
Did you have a text to that one?

22:10.603 --> 22:12.185
No, I don't.

22:12.225 --> 22:14.067
It's sort of a hodgepodge thing.

22:14.107 --> 22:17.730
But, you know, I cite declining SAT scores.

22:17.830 --> 22:21.433
I cite book sale figures.

22:21.453 --> 22:23.115
I cite enormous

22:23.753 --> 22:27.136
illiteracy issues that we have.

22:27.276 --> 22:28.397
You know, I cite all that.

22:28.517 --> 22:35.163
I cite, you know, some of the public perspectives, which have been challenged, some of the Benton Study stuff.

22:35.643 --> 22:37.044
When was the Benton Study published?

22:37.365 --> 22:38.445
In 96, I think.

22:39.086 --> 22:41.508
I could probably find that on the internet or whatever.

22:42.809 --> 22:45.231
Yeah, yeah.

22:45.391 --> 22:48.954
My perspective is, I actually don't think we're losing people.

22:50.115 --> 22:53.338
I think we're being forced to look at the world differently.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.432
In Boston today, we speak 140 languages.

22:59.715 --> 23:10.311
The Boston of 1848, while there were different language groups here, was nowhere near a world city in terms of its cultural diversity.

23:11.553 --> 23:12.534
It was a bustling place.

23:12.554 --> 23:15.679
There was the China trade, so there was Chinese.

23:16.640 --> 23:23.190
There was certainly major immigration from almost all the key ports in Europe, so a lot of European influx.

23:23.963 --> 23:33.512
Italian, Portuguese, certainly British, French, German, Polish migration.

23:34.914 --> 23:42.681
But today, we have a different complexion to what our constituency is.

23:42.701 --> 23:45.464
We're buying books now, I think, in about forty languages.

23:48.287 --> 23:51.490
How much do you spend each year on acquisitions?

23:51.510 --> 23:52.671
I think seven million.

23:53.967 --> 23:55.608
Up, down, status quo?

23:56.669 --> 24:02.014
It's about status quo, percentage-wise, but I think our target is to keep it at about 20%.

24:02.354 --> 24:06.358
And we're always looking for more money for acquisition.

24:06.418 --> 24:07.859
And what's your policy on deaccessions?

24:09.521 --> 24:10.401
We do very little.

24:11.763 --> 24:13.284
We keep almost everything.

24:15.366 --> 24:18.509
And, of course, we have off-site storage, which confirms that.

24:18.829 --> 24:20.430
We keep almost everything.

24:20.811 --> 24:22.472
I'll give you an example.

24:22.891 --> 24:26.435
what we think is the largest collection of city directories in the world.

24:26.455 --> 24:28.336
We have 50,000 city directories.

24:30.278 --> 24:31.860
It's an invaluable resource.

24:32.961 --> 24:33.802
Sure, they're out of date.

24:34.463 --> 24:35.744
You know, people laugh.

24:35.784 --> 24:37.225
I say, we have city directories.

24:37.806 --> 24:40.969
That's why you started at Harvard, how important city directories are to it.

24:40.989 --> 24:41.930
It's called research.

24:41.970 --> 24:43.051
Spectacular tools.

24:44.593 --> 24:52.020
It's interesting now, in our newspaper collections, as, say, in Bosnia,

24:52.979 --> 24:54.201
Cultures are being destroyed.

24:54.782 --> 24:58.407
I'm writing about that, by the way, in this book.

24:58.427 --> 25:03.334
Where do people go to re-establish their culture?

25:05.397 --> 25:08.421
We have newspapers that they don't have.

25:09.623 --> 25:10.625
You have newspapers here.

25:10.645 --> 25:11.566
I think so, yeah.

25:12.047 --> 25:14.931
And are you making copies available to them?

25:14.951 --> 25:17.214
You're working with Andreas over at Harvard on this?

25:17.735 --> 25:20.539
I think there's been contact.

25:21.042 --> 25:35.716
But it's interesting to see, because people don't see... You know, people don't see that what we do is capture all the evidence of culture.

25:38.338 --> 25:42.282
You know, that role is important.

25:43.163 --> 25:47.607
Our own culture, as well as this huge world, which is

25:48.177 --> 25:48.938
Certainly shrinking.

25:48.958 --> 25:55.928
But deaccessioning, you say that you do very little, but undoubtedly there must be some weeding and grooming.

25:55.948 --> 25:59.654
Yeah, I think what happens generally is we weed from the branch collections.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.398
Duplicates.

26:02.418 --> 26:06.424
You know, the best sellers, where you end up with, you know, 50 or something that you don't need.

26:07.405 --> 26:09.749
Most of those end up going into library book sales.

26:10.730 --> 26:13.855
The friends of the library, the citywide friends, organize.

26:14.596 --> 26:16.058
We throw very little out.

26:16.730 --> 26:20.853
I mean, it has to be generally... Is that kind of an institutional thing?

26:20.934 --> 26:22.555
Yeah, we are collectors.

26:22.695 --> 26:24.376
We are professional collectors.

26:24.456 --> 26:25.257
We believe in this.

26:26.498 --> 26:39.169
We believe in... Actually, you know, going back to the 1852 report, there's a little interesting review there of these four categories I mentioned.

26:39.189 --> 26:46.635
And one category, I've got to find it for you because it's worthy of a chuckle or two, but it's indeed...

26:47.307 --> 27:11.713
It's an important practice because it speaks to the second category of books on page 16 that the library should be collecting.

27:13.415 --> 27:15.357
The first category

27:16.163 --> 27:18.366
is books that cannot be taken out of the library.

27:18.526 --> 27:26.775
This is the expensive stuff and encyclopedias and things because of their rarity or costliness can't easily be replaced.

27:27.736 --> 27:33.864
Second category, books that few persons will wish to read.

27:35.145 --> 27:37.328
Excellent.

27:37.348 --> 27:38.289
And why is this important?

27:38.909 --> 27:41.232
Why would we buy something that few people want to read?

27:42.874 --> 27:45.377
Because it not only documents a culture,

27:46.268 --> 27:55.202
But because there may be no interest today doesn't speak to the potential interest that there may be 50 years or 100 or 150 years from now.

27:55.222 --> 28:05.819
I have Ken Carpenter telling me that when he was at Cress, he would buy books, 18th century economics books, that were uncut, meaning they'd never been read.

28:06.320 --> 28:06.780
That's right.

28:06.861 --> 28:11.147
And he said, and I bought them, and not really caring whether they would be read for another 200 years.

28:11.187 --> 28:11.648
That's right.

28:11.828 --> 28:12.850
That's not the point.

28:13.707 --> 28:19.232
becomes part of, as you say, the critical mass of a great research collection that has to be there.

28:19.252 --> 28:19.992
Exactly.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.995
So we today have things that no one else has.

28:25.077 --> 28:26.238
We have the ephemeral things.

28:27.319 --> 28:29.541
We have the fly-by-night.

28:30.642 --> 28:35.486
We just acquired a huge collection of the Haldim and Julius Little Blue books.

28:37.708 --> 28:38.469
They were ephemeral.

28:40.190 --> 28:42.032
There were thousands of them published, apparently.

28:42.072 --> 28:43.613
I think our collection now has

28:44.032 --> 28:57.224
5,000 of them, some of them written by important authors under pseudonyms, some of them important perspectives of the world, because they were like the supermarket little books.

28:57.264 --> 29:03.450
I don't know how much time you've been, but there are two areas I really want to hit.

29:03.470 --> 29:11.237
We have to talk about the flood, and you have to bring me up to date on that, and I want to press the feeling when you got the wood.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.402
Totally outside of—it happened.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.203
It was exterior.

29:15.524 --> 29:20.568
And was there an Augean stable discussion?

29:20.709 --> 29:24.812
Maybe this was an opportunity to get— You know, it's interesting here.

29:24.852 --> 29:26.654
The discussion was quite the opposite.

29:26.794 --> 29:28.376
Or was it general quarters to save?

29:28.656 --> 29:31.199
Save as much as we could possibly save.

29:31.239 --> 29:37.464
I mean, we sent 50,000 containers to be freeze dried.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.687
Worried about what it's going to cost later.

29:39.707 --> 29:40.127
Exactly.

29:42.098 --> 29:51.048
And only actually worried later in terms of would the quality of the saving be adequate to support the kind of service that we're used to.

29:51.789 --> 29:54.152
And there were unique things down there, weren't there?

29:54.172 --> 29:55.433
Unique things.

29:55.453 --> 29:56.735
Some of the patent things.

29:56.775 --> 30:08.528
A lot of damage in our gifts area, which is we've built great collections because there's a wonderful tradition of donating books to the library.

30:09.773 --> 30:12.257
I don't know how San Francisco feels about donating books.

30:12.317 --> 30:14.861
My suspicion is they don't.

30:15.461 --> 30:16.803
You don't want them?

30:16.824 --> 30:17.404
But we love them.

30:17.905 --> 30:18.166
Do you?

30:18.766 --> 30:19.307
We love them.

30:19.768 --> 30:20.088
Really?

30:21.691 --> 30:23.994
Because, I mean, there can be a lot of bulk in there.

30:24.014 --> 30:24.415
Of course.

30:26.177 --> 30:26.999
But it's interesting.

30:27.620 --> 30:33.508
Just a couple months ago, a person who handles our gifts came up and said, our goals, look what I found.

30:35.271 --> 30:37.975
It was a land grant from John Adams.

30:42.224 --> 30:42.765
Wow!

30:42.785 --> 30:44.667
Sealed.

30:44.687 --> 30:47.069
Stuck in a book.

30:47.089 --> 30:49.912
In a box of gifts.

30:49.932 --> 31:06.710
I mean, not only the sense of discovery that we have about that, and that's sort of my bookman part gets really revved up and excited about that, but this is how you systematically preserve and catalog your community's culture, your world culture.

31:08.211 --> 31:10.133
Gifts inform us.

31:10.273 --> 31:11.775
Gifts bring us things that

31:12.430 --> 31:14.533
We miss that no one else wants to read.

31:15.314 --> 31:17.958
The little red things, the more obscure things.

31:18.779 --> 31:24.588
So can you give me a brief update on how we're dealing with the flood?

31:24.628 --> 31:26.070
Where do you stand at this point?

31:26.150 --> 31:27.812
I'm not sure why I paid it again.

31:27.832 --> 31:30.716
Yeah, and maybe if we have time, we'll take a walk down there.

31:33.120 --> 31:38.207
We expect the flood loss is the cost to be somewhere between $10 and $16 million.

31:38.307 --> 31:40.851
And there has been an outpouring.

31:41.422 --> 31:42.744
We've had a lot of support.

31:43.505 --> 31:44.907
We've had some challenge grants.

31:44.947 --> 31:45.968
We've had fundraising.

31:45.988 --> 31:51.056
We've had, I mean, we put out a call because we needed plastic crates.

31:51.476 --> 31:52.097
I know that.

31:53.098 --> 31:55.121
You know, we had somebody call us.

31:56.163 --> 31:57.004
I have two crates.

31:57.445 --> 31:58.286
Can I bring them by?

31:59.047 --> 32:00.489
But I think it's pertinent, I doubt.

32:00.749 --> 32:08.360
We had a woman, an elderly woman come by, and we were closed, still closed, to the closest street door with a plastic crate.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.842
She said, I want to help you.

32:10.328 --> 32:14.553
This is an outpouring of support for collections.

32:14.573 --> 32:15.213
Exactly.

32:15.233 --> 32:15.714
Isn't it?

32:15.734 --> 32:15.994
It is.

32:17.216 --> 32:18.177
The building is sound.

32:18.257 --> 32:19.398
The building is fine.

32:20.179 --> 32:20.299
It is.

32:20.319 --> 32:20.559
It is.

32:20.599 --> 32:22.762
What we are concerned with here are the contents.

32:22.922 --> 32:23.382
Exactly.

32:25.164 --> 32:26.626
And it is kind of reassuring.

32:26.646 --> 32:35.936
Enormous testimonial to people's interest in this whole activity of preserving even what they may not themselves ever use.

32:36.717 --> 32:38.219
A patent from 1876.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.340
That's right.

32:39.995 --> 32:40.616
Who cares?

32:41.437 --> 32:42.819
I mean, the argument could be made.

32:44.341 --> 32:44.481
Right.

32:44.501 --> 32:44.982
A lot of people care.

32:45.002 --> 32:50.489
Well, actually, a lot of people not only care, but benefit from that information, from that resource.

32:51.451 --> 32:52.813
It is kind of uplifting in a way.

32:52.833 --> 32:58.140
And I'll tell you, to see your staff, to see these people, I mean, it was... Well, my people are great.

32:58.160 --> 33:08.314
I mean, I was interviewed by BBC, and the guy said to me, well, why would people be concerned about this?

33:09.425 --> 33:17.497
And I said, well, if you were a preacher and you lost the holy book, would you be upset?

33:18.939 --> 33:24.407
If you were a pianist and your piano was destroyed, how would you feel?

33:25.429 --> 33:30.637
If you were a carpenter and you lost your hammer, how would you feel?

33:31.037 --> 33:36.225
I mean, these are the tools that we permit us to practice our professions.

33:37.454 --> 33:38.896
What were the actual numbers?

33:38.916 --> 33:42.722
Because I see a variety of numbers on books and microfilm.

33:43.383 --> 33:47.990
I think right now about 3.3 million items.

33:48.010 --> 33:55.522
But that includes individual fiche, you know, and film rolls and books and documents and so on.

33:55.662 --> 33:57.945
Can you freeze by the fiche in the same manner?

33:58.246 --> 33:58.787
We tried.

33:59.207 --> 33:59.768
We tried.

34:00.209 --> 34:03.474
Some of the fiche in the film did not do as well.

34:03.714 --> 34:05.537
And I suspect most of that

34:06.597 --> 34:08.640
we will probably end up having to replace.

34:11.965 --> 34:14.228
We had two sort of problems.

34:15.109 --> 34:29.750
One was time, and the other was that there was so much silt and dirt that came up with the water that that just permeated everything.

34:29.770 --> 34:34.697
And so you can dry it out, you can remove the water, but then you have a book that is dirty.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.529
I mean, almost impregnated.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.532
This freeze-dry process is amazing, though.

34:41.592 --> 34:42.353
That's fascinating.

34:42.673 --> 34:44.315
It is fascinating.

34:44.335 --> 34:45.176
It is fascinating.

34:45.956 --> 34:47.958
Just a visionary statement.

34:48.679 --> 34:52.743
Your concept of what it takes to be a librarian now and in the future.

34:52.983 --> 34:57.307
You're no longer just a custodian of books.

34:57.447 --> 35:04.093
Well, for me, it's hard to speak because, I mean, obviously in my case, you know, a position like this,

35:05.238 --> 35:25.729
I'm a manager, I'm an administrator, I'm sometimes a politician, I'm a salesman, I'm an orator, I'm a huckster, I'm a counselor, I'm a therapist, I'm a million different things, depending upon the day and the time, it seems.

35:25.749 --> 35:29.034
You have to raise funds in the manner of saying that Paul Mclare does in New York.

35:29.054 --> 35:29.575
Of course.

35:29.926 --> 35:31.708
Of course, I'm out hustling all the time.

35:31.888 --> 35:34.050
Paul says he has to raise a half a million bucks a week.

35:35.072 --> 35:43.441
That's his nut.

35:43.901 --> 35:45.643
You know, there are all those demands.

35:45.743 --> 35:58.617
I like to think of myself, though, as someone who indeed embodies the principles of equal access and this idea that you get rich at the library.

35:59.558 --> 36:15.080
This idea that it doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter the color of your skin, it doesn't matter your name, it doesn't matter the language you speak, the nation of your ancestry, it doesn't matter what kind of clothes you wear or the shoes on your feet, whether you're, you know, it doesn't matter any of that.

36:16.322 --> 36:22.811
This is a place where you can come, our 26 branches, this building is where you can come and get rich.

36:23.872 --> 36:27.878
This is a public library and not an academic library, and I'm mindful of that.

36:28.550 --> 36:40.101
When I tell you that there's a new university opened in Florida, and the president, his original thought was to have a library no bigger than a telephone booth.

36:40.121 --> 36:42.543
I mean, this is virtual you.

36:42.903 --> 36:44.004
It scares me.

36:44.024 --> 36:44.785
It scares you.

36:44.805 --> 36:46.306
Yeah, it scares me.

36:46.366 --> 36:48.749
First of all, I don't think that's likely to be very successful.

36:48.809 --> 36:54.354
Then they went off and bought 100,000 books from Upsil and College in New Jersey, which is in my book.

36:55.695 --> 36:58.017
Well, I tell this story when I was in Monroe, Michigan.

36:59.532 --> 37:03.738
We had an annual book sale, books that were donated.

37:03.818 --> 37:06.082
Actually, we became very entrepreneurial.

37:06.122 --> 37:11.670
We got leftovers from other library book sales, things that other libraries couldn't sell.

37:11.770 --> 37:16.698
We used to go and get truckloads from Ann Arbor or Lansing or other places and bring them in.

37:17.699 --> 37:24.730
And a big, I don't know, six-bay garage, bookmobiles that we'd just fill the books.

37:25.351 --> 37:29.517
We'd get publishers to donate stuff, and we had a lot of stuff.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.343
And one book sale, and I was out there.

37:33.383 --> 37:39.171
It was sort of an interest of mine as a way of raising money, and I had a lot of fun with it.

37:41.214 --> 37:50.568
And we had a guy, and it was like a three or four day sale, and he came the first day, and he bought $100 worth of books and paid in cash.

37:52.430 --> 37:53.552
He came back the next day.

37:55.709 --> 37:56.550
Another hundred hours.

37:58.511 --> 37:59.452
Came back the next day.

38:01.374 --> 38:04.136
And this went on and we ended up extending the sale.

38:04.897 --> 38:08.160
He'd come back like four days in a row, a hundred hours worth of books.

38:09.321 --> 38:13.905
And each time I gave him a deal, you know, quote unquote, you know.

38:13.925 --> 38:18.109
And I couldn't figure out, there was no rhyme, no reason that I could see what he was buying.

38:19.950 --> 38:22.753
So I finally said to him, I said, you know, why don't you buy the whole thing?

38:23.033 --> 38:24.214
Why don't you buy every man's left?

38:25.409 --> 38:29.554
And he said, well, I'd consider doing that.

38:30.535 --> 38:31.275
Let's talk about it.

38:33.698 --> 38:35.200
And I said, well, what do you want all these for?

38:38.043 --> 38:49.415
He was founding a new college, a Christian college, and the state required for accreditation a certain number of books in the library with certain imprint dates.

38:50.116 --> 38:52.699
You had to have X number of books printed.

38:53.337 --> 38:54.038
In the past 10 years.

38:54.058 --> 38:55.220
Do you know the name of this college?

38:55.501 --> 38:56.282
I don't know the name of it.

38:56.442 --> 38:57.244
Where was it again?

38:57.604 --> 38:59.287
It was in suburban Detroit.

38:59.307 --> 38:59.808
About when?

39:02.012 --> 39:06.881
This would have been probably 84... I've used this in another context.

39:06.901 --> 39:08.243
84, 85.

39:09.085 --> 39:13.232
So it ended up, so it ended up, it ended up that he bought everything.

39:14.374 --> 39:16.257
And he brought the church buses...

39:18.751 --> 39:28.286
And we loaded these boxes after boxes after boxes onto these church buses to take back for them to store for their new, quote, college.

39:28.987 --> 39:30.490
So content was irrelevant to him.

39:30.590 --> 39:31.151
Irrelevant.

39:32.012 --> 39:33.415
Irrelevant.

39:33.435 --> 39:34.536
And in a way it was sad.

39:34.556 --> 39:36.440
In a huge way it's sad.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.104
Because he's fooling the accreditation people.

39:39.124 --> 39:39.464
Exactly.

39:39.524 --> 39:40.386
It was a way.

39:41.488 --> 39:44.052
And the irony that this was a religious institution.

39:44.713 --> 39:46.075
But he was following the rules.

39:46.747 --> 39:49.450
And obviously it helped us financially.

39:49.530 --> 39:55.778
Which is why, you know, you look at ARL statistics, and people say numbers don't really matter, but look at Berkeley.

39:56.458 --> 40:03.126
When the numbers start going down, and you have this extraordinary uprising going on, the numbers do better.

40:03.226 --> 40:10.615
And for years, David Stamm told me, he said, you know, a lot of people for years were buying just bulk to spike their numbers in the first place.

40:11.135 --> 40:15.100
So what they're getting rid of, and he's very honest about it, is the bulk.

40:15.282 --> 40:18.066
But I'm skeptical about that.

40:18.126 --> 40:22.793
I mean, I think somebody has to be thorough.

40:24.996 --> 40:27.180
And the system right now is serendipitous.

40:28.782 --> 40:39.318
It's amazing if you're a researcher, and I've researched things that I've been interested in, to go to the places where you think the best collections are and to find things that aren't there.

40:40.219 --> 40:44.125
To find oddities.

40:45.505 --> 40:49.511
An interesting experience, some years ago I had bought a painting.

40:51.214 --> 40:53.518
It turned out to be a painting by a very well-known artist.

40:54.339 --> 40:59.047
And the way it had been framed, the signature was covered.

41:00.449 --> 41:04.776
And no one knew until I bought it and sort of took it apart.

41:05.717 --> 41:08.061
It was a fairly well-known painter.

41:08.962 --> 41:09.503
American?

41:09.523 --> 41:10.264
American painter.

41:11.286 --> 41:12.508
And it turned out that

41:13.923 --> 41:30.406
This was, this had originally been produced as an illustration and was the first illustrated published piece by this painter, Maynard Dixon, western painter.

41:32.910 --> 41:43.525
And I learned just sort of accidentally in reading something about him that I thought that this was, what I had was the piece that probably had been

41:43.994 --> 41:46.257
printed in the first book that he illustrated.

41:48.460 --> 41:51.824
I searched high and low to find the book.

41:53.005 --> 41:53.686
Obscure book.

41:54.948 --> 41:55.949
Found it in my own library.

41:58.372 --> 41:59.313
You mean your home library?

41:59.674 --> 42:00.014
Yeah.

42:00.034 --> 42:00.935
Mike's Big Library District.

42:02.598 --> 42:05.081
Had acquired this book in 1898 when it was published.

42:07.504 --> 42:13.191
But many other libraries with important Western collections that I had queried

42:13.542 --> 42:14.143
didn't have it.

42:15.124 --> 42:15.985
That's a great story.

42:17.226 --> 42:19.429
What was the title of the book?

42:19.949 --> 42:25.316
Um, Tales of Sunland, I think is the name of it.

42:25.336 --> 42:37.730
But, you know, it's interesting for me to see that as thorough as we are in library collection development, there are gaps everywhere.

42:38.531 --> 42:42.115
Because it isn't a coordinated, disciplined,

42:43.225 --> 42:48.510
collection approach among and across libraries.

42:48.530 --> 42:52.294
So what's bulk somewhere may not be somewhere else.

42:53.736 --> 42:56.018
You know, your trash, my treasure.

42:56.679 --> 42:57.700
Oh, indeed.

42:57.720 --> 42:58.601
That happens a lot.

42:58.661 --> 43:00.182
That happens a lot.

43:01.063 --> 43:02.745
And the stories are wonderful when you encounter them.

43:02.785 --> 43:10.333
Yeah, you know, would I argue that the Boston Public Library should be buying every Reader's Digest condensed book?

43:10.353 --> 43:10.413
No.

43:10.433 --> 43:11.494
But somebody probably should.

43:13.077 --> 43:16.423
And interestingly enough, as you all know, people collect them.

43:17.124 --> 43:17.885
Amazingly enough.

43:18.326 --> 43:20.590
People collect them.

43:20.690 --> 43:24.337
At the same library book sales, I remember a man who had a notebook.

43:25.439 --> 43:26.340
He had everyone listed.

43:26.921 --> 43:28.664
And he'd come and he'd go through the piles.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.850
He'd go through the piles looking for the ones he was missing.

43:32.932 --> 43:34.835
So tell me, you were in New England there.

43:34.855 --> 43:36.638
You traveled around?

43:37.242 --> 43:41.326
I've probably spent half my life in Colorado.

43:41.346 --> 43:45.830
Tell me, is there something about Boston and the book culture here that you could come and do?

43:45.850 --> 43:46.251
I love it.

43:46.551 --> 43:48.893
I love being in this library.

43:48.953 --> 43:54.959
This is the cat's meow for a librarian, I think.

43:54.979 --> 43:59.023
I mean, particularly for somebody who appreciates the kind of book and treasures.

43:59.063 --> 44:01.085
I mean, because our treasures even go beyond books.

44:01.105 --> 44:02.727
Our prints and print department are

44:03.618 --> 44:05.682
I mean, the unusual things we have.

44:05.782 --> 44:10.812
I mean, the gold medal that was presented to George Washington when he won the Battle of Dorchester Heights.

44:11.734 --> 44:13.818
I mean, we have that in our collection.

44:13.838 --> 44:15.140
I've held that in my hands.

44:15.160 --> 44:21.552
I mean, if that doesn't give you sort of this amazing, you know, feeling.

44:21.572 --> 44:26.622
You know, I did a panel this week on that C-SPAN has been around.

44:27.277 --> 44:56.254
on on the book in the in the next century that are dead or alive no this is something that the associates did actually here in boston and i took one of i took a leaf from the gutenberg bible that we have in our collection to show people i mean we have these amazingly important treasures and certainly our task is how do we share those how do we and this is an area where maybe technology can help maybe technology can

44:56.791 --> 44:59.513
give people some of the taste and feel and flavor.

44:59.534 --> 45:04.438
The British Library has this turn-the-page thing that they're dealing with the Indus foreign gospels.

45:04.458 --> 45:04.958
Interesting.

45:06.240 --> 45:10.664
Because it is a book that nobody is ever going to be able to see at any age.

45:10.684 --> 45:11.845
That's right, exactly.

45:11.945 --> 45:20.052
As Umberto Eco told me, he said, if I, you know, one page a day of the Book of Tales... Are you going to quote his essay on... The page I wrote on him, I'm putting in the book.

45:20.072 --> 45:22.875
I wrote a... I didn't interview you... Umberto Eco on his thing on a library.

45:22.895 --> 45:24.216
He did an essay on a library?

45:24.685 --> 45:29.993
I interviewed him last fall and I wrote a piece for Biblio, which was a really nice piece.

45:30.954 --> 45:32.716
And that's going in the new book.

45:32.736 --> 45:34.900
I did a piece with Maurice Sendak for Civilization.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.201
That's going in.

45:36.221 --> 45:42.050
It's going to be really... Crazy hodgepodge book like the other one, but book culture.

45:42.190 --> 45:43.692
Yeah, important.

45:43.712 --> 45:48.058
And how I sorted out a little sleight of hand in mirrors, maybe.

45:48.899 --> 45:50.562
I'm losing my voice, and I know you're busy.

45:50.802 --> 45:52.765
And I would like to take a couple more shots.

45:53.045 --> 45:54.287
The beauty is you're close.

45:54.723 --> 46:08.500
and I will transcribe this, and Boston is really, you know, it's wonderful, and it will play a major role in this new book, and so that's great.

46:08.600 --> 46:09.381
Anything I missed?

46:11.363 --> 46:12.525
Probably tons, but you know.

46:12.545 --> 46:21.135
Something that you would particularly like me to walk away with, you know, the knowledge of anything that you think I should... I think...

46:21.301 --> 46:25.206
But probably, you know, that at least I believe that books are alive and well.

46:27.209 --> 46:31.435
It's very much part of what we do here at the Boston Public Library.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.917
Can I get a couple shots behind the desk?

46:32.937 --> 46:33.658
Sure, sure.

46:34.259 --> 46:34.860
And I have this.

46:34.880 --> 46:35.881
You gave this to me already.

46:35.901 --> 46:37.604
My book lamp?

46:37.624 --> 46:37.784
Yeah.

46:37.884 --> 46:40.928
And did you, did I get some of those?

46:43.772 --> 46:46.376
I could do a whole section in your book about library book sales.

46:46.816 --> 46:49.180
I love them.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.802
This is a library book sales story.

46:51.946 --> 46:57.073
Friends of the Library at Pikes Peak actually had been two annual book sales.

46:58.695 --> 47:05.824
And after one sale, they had so much material left that they didn't have a clue of what to do with it.

47:07.687 --> 47:19.202
And so they came to me and said, you know, Bernie, we'll get you the CD when that's done, and here's

47:19.756 --> 47:21.478
And the propaganda.

47:21.498 --> 47:24.942
They came to me and said, well, what do you think we should do?

47:24.962 --> 47:26.304
I said, well, I don't really know.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.567
I think we should probably have a contest or something.

47:28.607 --> 47:31.591
And they did have some kind of contest.

47:31.751 --> 47:38.539
And the end result was they had a suggestion that they should make furniture out of the books.

47:38.559 --> 47:48.852
So a guy by the name of Chuck Robinoff, who was a book, actually a book, a rare bookseller and an engineer, decided, well,

47:49.372 --> 47:49.853
A lamp.

47:52.638 --> 48:00.213
I think $150 later, not counting his labor, this is the lamp that he produced.

48:00.233 --> 48:01.295
I love how to get pregnant.

48:01.616 --> 48:04.060
Right.

48:04.221 --> 48:12.156
They produced this, and they figured out that there was absolutely no economic utility to trying to produce these lamps.

48:12.777 --> 48:20.248
with the amount of money that he had to invest in the lampshade and the wiring and the base and all the other material, that there's no way.

48:21.290 --> 48:28.180
So they presented this to me and they put a plaque on it as a gift of thanks to me as being a friend of the friend of the libraries.

48:29.402 --> 48:41.080
And he teased me because he said now, and I know this really wasn't quite true, but that they picked out the books with me specifically in there.

48:41.819 --> 48:50.050
So one of them is, I think, seeking spiritual direction and how to get pregnant and how to more effective meetings or something.

48:50.931 --> 49:09.056
And, of course, I cackle when I... So it's something that I've had as part of my office since that presentation quite a few years ago, actually.

49:09.076 --> 49:10.999
I want you to use it for...

49:12.886 --> 49:16.390
I came back with 500 pictures.

49:16.991 --> 49:17.131
Uh-oh.

49:17.151 --> 49:19.734
And how many are good?

49:20.635 --> 49:21.796
You know, a couple in each room.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.299
I started looking for them.

49:24.319 --> 49:28.484
You know, I had one spectacular picture of a pretty old library.

49:28.504 --> 49:29.285
You know, that's the one.

49:30.526 --> 49:34.251
Only one is one.

49:34.271 --> 49:37.534
20 pictures, that's more.

49:37.554 --> 49:38.415
You going to the book fair?

49:39.156 --> 49:39.356
Yeah.

49:41.739 --> 49:42.420
Can I not?

49:44.105 --> 49:45.107
I don't know if I'll go tonight.

49:45.127 --> 49:50.781
I always like to go on the first day, but I'm not actively collecting these days.

49:50.801 --> 49:52.084
What I do is support my research.

49:52.224 --> 49:55.091
I'm not actively collecting, but I'm just buying books.

49:55.211 --> 49:57.777
Well, I spent a fortune on it.
