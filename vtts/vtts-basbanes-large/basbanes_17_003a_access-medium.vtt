00:02.579 --> 00:27.135
And hello everybody, welcome to The Book Guys, our inaugural occasion.

00:27.487 --> 00:37.743
Delighted to be speaking with you from the studios of WAMU in Washington, where The Book Guys is recorded live on tape, making it easier for you to participate.

00:38.325 --> 00:39.268
I'm Mike Cuthbert.

00:39.603 --> 00:46.793
And our special guest every week, our co-host is Alan Stipek, the owner of Second Story Books here in Washington, D.C.

00:47.474 --> 00:49.597
And we do, well, we're going to tell them what we do.

00:49.697 --> 00:50.478
Alan, good to see you.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.000
Good to see you tonight, Mike.

00:52.020 --> 01:01.813
We have done this, we should mention, several times before here in Washington on both commercial and public radio stations as separate episodes of a talk show that I formerly had.

01:01.793 --> 01:08.383
And frankly, this is a program that just had to come to the air nationally because people kept telling us it had to be.

01:08.463 --> 01:09.745
It was perfect for public radio.

01:10.326 --> 01:13.872
Well, we got very good response from the shows for now 15 years.

01:13.932 --> 01:22.645
And every time we're on, we get a lot of interesting questions and we try to give a lot of interesting information back to the audience.

01:22.726 --> 01:24.288
The ground rules are very simple, folks.

01:24.328 --> 01:25.590
This is all you have to do.

01:25.570 --> 01:30.255
When you call the book guys and when you're on the air with us, just be sure you have your book with you.

01:30.495 --> 01:30.916
That's all.

01:31.396 --> 01:33.438
A book that is probably used.

01:33.538 --> 01:43.629
Now, as you'll find out as we go along, some of the used books may be only a year old because it turns out, Alan, that the value of a book doesn't always depend just on its age.

01:43.649 --> 01:43.869
No.

01:44.850 --> 01:52.058
The listeners should understand that a book that might be printed in the year 1700 will be worth a lot less than a book that was published six months ago.

01:52.098 --> 01:54.160
And we're going to give you many examples of that.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.783
As we go along week by week.

01:56.144 --> 02:00.051
Well, actually, you'll give us examples of that because it's your books that we talk about.

02:00.532 --> 02:02.877
Now, to get involved with the book, guys, it's very simple.

02:03.238 --> 02:11.794
As I mentioned, we record live to tape, which means that our answering service takes calls at 1-800-828-BOOK.

02:12.061 --> 02:20.480
And during the week before a broadcast, our producer goes through all the calls, picks the first several that appeal to her, and you get on the air.

02:20.660 --> 02:21.562
We call you at home.

02:21.602 --> 02:28.197
It's a very convenient, easy way to get on the radio, and we have a good time.

02:28.632 --> 02:34.139
The guideline we've got to mention to you, though, is that neither Alan or I are going to know what these books are about.

02:34.679 --> 02:36.602
Alan, in fact, is almost nutty on the subject.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.264
Well, no, I'm passionate about it.

02:38.384 --> 02:53.762
I do not want to have one piece of knowledge before a person calls in, because I really want to feel that the listeners understand that I'm going along with them, and I want them to ask me every question they can conceive of, and if they stump me, so much the better.

02:53.742 --> 02:57.788
Now, we have had some really success stories on here.

02:57.888 --> 03:05.198
I suppose the biggest one, Alan, for the book guys when we were just doing a segment was the lady who called about Gone with the Wind.

03:05.338 --> 03:05.879
No question.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.461
What happened in that case?

03:07.482 --> 03:15.853
Well, a woman called us, and it must be a year ago, and said that she had an inscribed copy of a first edition of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell.

03:15.873 --> 03:18.417
Now, what's the difference between an inscription and a signed copy?

03:18.397 --> 03:22.002
Well, Sign Company would simply have the signature of the author in it.

03:22.062 --> 03:29.131
An inscription could be anywhere from yours very truly, Margaret Mitchell, to a five-page inscription talking about the book.

03:29.572 --> 03:37.743
And in this situation, the Margaret Mitchell inscription was a ten-line poem in hand by Margaret Mitchell of the fall of the South.

03:37.763 --> 03:40.827
Though that was printed in 1865,

03:40.807 --> 03:47.658
There was also a, not printed in 1865 by Margaret Mitchell, but was previously published.

03:47.979 --> 04:07.371
She copied that, but did have enclosed in the book a four-page letter on her personal stationery discussing the creation of the book, the writing of the book Gone with the Wind, stating to her friend that she was now in the middle of a nervous and physical breakdown due to the pressures put on her by her publisher, Macmillan, to get the final draft on the book.

04:07.351 --> 04:09.075
talking about what the book was about.

04:09.295 --> 04:10.898
This is a phenomenal source letter.

04:11.480 --> 04:19.336
And we were able to sell that book with the inscription and the letter for $15,000 for this person, who I understand using it for very good purposes.

04:19.356 --> 04:21.560
She put a couple of her kids through school for a couple of years.

04:21.901 --> 04:25.589
Now, we're not going to guarantee that's going to happen every week, but it happens periodically.

04:26.029 --> 04:28.735
So let's find out if our listeners, you at home,

04:28.715 --> 04:30.938
have some valuable books or not.

04:31.338 --> 04:35.964
Along the way, we're just going to have a lot of fun talking about one of our favorite activities, and that's reading.

04:36.264 --> 04:42.672
Because eventually, whether or not the book is worth thousands of dollars or not, if it's not worth reading, it's probably not worth having.

04:42.692 --> 04:46.056
But have you seen a book that could be described as that other than a blank one?

04:46.516 --> 04:47.057
What?

04:47.297 --> 04:48.759
That's worth reading?

04:49.180 --> 04:52.123
Oh, there's a lot of books that I personally wouldn't read, but...

04:52.103 --> 04:54.266
I'm not saying that somebody out there would.

04:55.127 --> 05:01.456
But, you know, every book has its person that will want to buy one or to feel it's worth something.

05:01.496 --> 05:07.845
We just want people to understand that if we say a book is valueless, that doesn't mean it is not important for the individual.

05:07.885 --> 05:11.149
It just means on the market, it just doesn't have any resale value.

05:11.269 --> 05:18.399
On the current market, because one thing I've learned is never assume that today's book that isn't worth much is going to be tomorrow's book that isn't worth much.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.080
Oh, no question.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.283
I mean, we can use examples like...

05:21.263 --> 05:23.005
The Bridge Over Madison County.

05:23.045 --> 05:25.769
This is a book which came out in a limited edition printing.

05:26.170 --> 05:30.215
The publisher didn't anticipate the book would be popular, but it was skyrocketed.

05:30.255 --> 05:33.119
And now a first edition of that book sells for over $300.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.442
Even though there's millions of them out there?

05:35.462 --> 05:37.045
Well, the first edition there aren't millions.

05:37.085 --> 05:38.927
The first print run probably was $2,500.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.512
And that's a perfect example of books which come out

05:42.492 --> 05:47.058
which the publisher didn't anticipate the popularity of John Gresham, A Time to Kill.

05:47.439 --> 05:49.882
The first edition of that book was 1,500 copies.

05:50.383 --> 05:55.950
Now that book sells for almost $2,000 or $2,000, depending on what bookseller has it.

05:55.970 --> 05:59.155
So let's go to our phones and talk with some of you about your books.

05:59.295 --> 06:01.398
Let's go first to Washington, D.C.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.320
Rudy, you're on with the book guys.

06:04.101 --> 06:04.602
Hi there.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.358
Whoops, let me put Rudy on the air.

06:07.378 --> 06:07.799
Hi, Rudy.

06:08.340 --> 06:08.500
Hi.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.303
Can you speak a little louder?

06:10.323 --> 06:11.484
This is not the greatest connection.

06:11.544 --> 06:12.346
Sure, we got you.

06:12.386 --> 06:13.347
How do you hear us now?

06:13.407 --> 06:14.509
Much better, thank you.

06:14.529 --> 06:14.729
Okay.

06:15.110 --> 06:16.292
What have you got for us, Rudy?

06:16.532 --> 06:19.837
Well, I've got something that isn't even in English.

06:20.238 --> 06:29.712
But what I've got is a complete set of the works of Goethe, which is, in fact, in 56 volumes, although fairly small ones.

06:30.063 --> 06:35.971
The size cover is about three and a half inches by five and a quarter inches.

06:36.652 --> 06:43.441
It's his complete works, although there may be one with two little things missing because, in fact, it appeared before he died.

06:43.521 --> 06:44.442
This is dated 1828.

06:44.562 --> 06:45.744
He died in 1832.

06:47.846 --> 06:54.315
Apart from that, these are his complete works, which were printed, as I say, in 1828.

06:54.565 --> 07:02.220
by something called the Kotta bookshop.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.682
I guess they did their own printing also.

07:03.702 --> 07:09.494
Now, the thing is, I speak German, but I won't be here forever.

07:09.734 --> 07:11.457
My children do not speak German.

07:11.558 --> 07:13.401
I have heard, how reliably, I don't know,

07:13.668 --> 07:16.332
that this could be worth something either here or in Germany.

07:17.433 --> 07:18.435
Do any thoughts come to you?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.718
Yes, it could be worth something here or in Germany.

07:20.758 --> 07:21.779
You're correct about that.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.789
A set of Goethe that early automatically is going to have value because it was published during the author's life.

07:29.150 --> 07:36.300
Now, in the set, do the individual volumes have different dates on them, or are they all dated the same year?

07:36.280 --> 07:41.348
I think they have different dates with the last one, I believe, shortly after his death.

07:41.448 --> 07:49.320
Well, that will indicate that probably some of the volumes are first editions, and they were published as the author wrote the individual work.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.341
That is possible, yes.

07:50.542 --> 07:51.743
It's probable, to be honest.

07:51.823 --> 07:53.306
What are the books bound in?

07:53.346 --> 07:54.808
Are they bound in contemporary leather?

07:54.848 --> 08:00.236
No, it is bound in something you would probably be able to tell immediately.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.760
It looks like parchment paper.

08:03.145 --> 08:08.493
something like that, very thick paper with a kind of a brown pattern on it.

08:08.554 --> 08:13.862
I don't think it pretends to be leather, with a pattern almost like you might find in some types of marble.

08:13.882 --> 08:14.162
Right.

08:14.263 --> 08:15.785
Those are marbleized boards.

08:15.845 --> 08:19.190
They're cloth boards that probably have some vellum in it.

08:19.411 --> 08:28.345
Vellum is goat skin, and if it looked like parchment and it felt like, would you say, does it feel like skin?

08:28.786 --> 08:30.368
Have you ever seen vellum?

08:30.601 --> 08:32.243
You've got it exactly, yes.

08:32.323 --> 08:32.523
Okay.

08:32.543 --> 08:39.992
It's probably bound with a cloth board over it to kind of act as an extra reinforcement.

08:40.113 --> 08:43.196
It's not abnormal for that time period, especially in Germany and in France.

08:43.997 --> 08:46.660
Does that kind of cover, does that have to be contemporary?

08:46.681 --> 08:48.443
Oh, it's definitely contemporary.

08:48.603 --> 08:50.305
That is probably the publisher's binding.

08:50.645 --> 08:53.689
Now, probably what happened was when that book was published,

08:53.669 --> 09:23.490
the or the set was published that it came into two variant bindings one which is the boards that you have which would be an inexpensive binding and then depending on the subscriber an individual who wanted a more deluxe binding they would get a leather binding that could be anywhere from a quarter leather to a full leather binding and then the the elaboration on that binding being you know a full morocco versus just a regular calf binding yes I'm almost sure that it is not leather I do have some some older German books which are bound in full leather

09:23.774 --> 09:27.622
And the binding is, the covering rather, is falling apart.

09:27.642 --> 09:30.187
I guess the American climate doesn't agree with it too much.

09:30.608 --> 09:34.676
Whereas these look as good as they must have looked the day they were published.

09:34.797 --> 09:36.400
All the bindings are the same then.

09:36.498 --> 09:39.323
All the bindings are the same, the whole set, correct?

09:39.343 --> 09:39.904
Right.

09:39.925 --> 09:41.387
Well, I'm going to just hazard a guess.

09:41.447 --> 09:47.900
I mean, I don't have a reference book here that would have that individual set that I could tell you right off the top of my head.

09:48.260 --> 09:51.667
But a set like that would sell for thousands of dollars.

09:51.787 --> 09:53.931
I don't know how many thousands of dollars.

09:53.971 --> 09:54.833
It could be a thousand.

09:54.853 --> 09:55.975
It could be three thousand.

09:55.955 --> 10:00.267
What you'd have to do is get in touch with a competent bookseller in your area.

10:01.270 --> 10:06.023
What we suggest is that you contact the ABAA at 50 Rockefeller Plaza in New York.

10:06.043 --> 10:07.146
One moment, let me get that down.

10:07.226 --> 10:08.530
50 Rockefeller Plaza.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.058
in New York?

10:10.178 --> 10:12.342
New York, zip 10020.

10:13.023 --> 10:19.736
I am a member of the ABAA, and I highly refer anybody who calls in to use the ABAA, which is a national organization.

10:19.756 --> 10:21.980
There are 450 dealers around the country.

10:22.301 --> 10:26.569
They can supply you with a directory, or if you want, you can call 1-800-

10:26.549 --> 10:32.178
828 book, and we would be happy to send you a copy of the directory because we keep them in stock.

10:32.198 --> 10:40.230
And so you'd be getting the opportunity to look through the directory and find booksellers in your specific area that could help you get a true value on it.

10:40.331 --> 10:41.893
Alan Rudy brought up something interesting.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.739
He said that it's probably worth something here or in Germany.

10:45.759 --> 10:50.106
Is this the kind of set that it would be worth Rudy's time to go to Germany to try to sell?

10:50.186 --> 10:54.092
Well, I wouldn't say it's... I mean, if you want to take a trip to Munich and this is...

10:54.072 --> 11:15.453
Great opportunity to use an excuse, but quite frankly, with the way telecommunications are, I think a fax would suffice, and certainly you could contact the ILAB, which is the International League of Antiquarian Bookmen, which the ABAA is the American organization, and you can get an ILAB directory, again, from 50 Rock, and they can give you the names of all the booksellers in Germany.

11:15.773 --> 11:18.816
And believe me, all those booksellers would love to get a set of Goethe.

11:18.836 --> 11:23.100
It's a very popular time period in German literature.

11:23.080 --> 11:32.896
German books sell very well in both the states, and I know so many American dealers, including myself, that are frequently sending over to Germany faxes of books that we pick up.

11:33.217 --> 11:34.759
And there is a very strong market.

11:35.360 --> 11:35.741
I see.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.582
And an international one.

11:36.602 --> 11:37.023
Oh, sure.

11:37.303 --> 11:38.405
You could FedEx the set.

11:39.026 --> 11:47.400
I mean, one of the beauties of the fact that we now have Federal Express and other overnight companies, and we have the faxes and the Internet...

11:47.380 --> 11:56.616
is that book selling has become a touch kind of business, and people can now sell books in foreign languages to the areas that are indigenous, and it's really picking up the market.

11:57.437 --> 12:01.044
In the late 80s, Japan was where everybody sold their books.

12:01.084 --> 12:05.912
I mean, the Japanese were feverish in their attempt to buy every known book on Earth.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.537
Including non-Japanese books?

12:08.678 --> 12:10.421
Oh, especially non-Japanese books.

12:10.681 --> 12:20.280
You would go to any auction house around the world, and you would see every Japanese bookseller in the first or second row with their paddles up, not putting them down for anything.

12:20.301 --> 12:20.902
How interesting.

12:20.922 --> 12:22.585
Rudy, we thank you very much for your call.

12:22.565 --> 12:25.929
And I thank you, and I'll follow your suggestions.

12:25.949 --> 12:26.149
Very good.

12:26.169 --> 12:26.690
Thanks very much.

12:26.730 --> 12:27.311
Good talking to you.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.873
That's Rudy with a complete set of Goethe.

12:28.953 --> 12:33.018
And we should mention, we didn't mention at the start, that foreign language is perfectly fine with us.

12:33.218 --> 12:34.039
Oh, sure.

12:34.059 --> 12:35.701
More exciting things happen in foreign languages.

12:35.721 --> 12:35.982
Sanskrit.

12:36.362 --> 12:37.103
Especially French.

12:37.704 --> 12:41.428
Robert, good day to you, and welcome to the book, guys.

12:42.670 --> 12:43.271
Hello, Robert.

12:43.391 --> 12:44.252
Are you talking to me?

12:44.272 --> 12:45.053
We certainly are.

12:45.153 --> 12:45.573
Okay, I'm here.

12:45.954 --> 12:46.955
Okay, what have you got for us?

12:47.396 --> 12:48.437
Well, I've got a book.

12:48.839 --> 13:03.743
The title of it is With a Prehistoric People by Rutledge and his wife, and it discusses his living in East Africa and writing a history, and been one of the first ones to write a history of the Kukuku in Kenya.

13:04.178 --> 13:08.043
And I got it while I was there, and I just wondered if it was any value at all.

13:08.063 --> 13:11.346
Okay, Rutledge, this was what, published in about 1940?

13:12.388 --> 13:13.970
Which Rutledge was this?

13:13.990 --> 13:15.712
1928, I think.

13:15.732 --> 13:18.955
Okay, and the first name of Mr. Rutledge?

13:20.037 --> 13:20.898
W. Scoresby.

13:21.318 --> 13:21.859
W. Scoresby.

13:22.480 --> 13:30.309
And this is on, would you say this is a colonialist point of view of the world of Kenya?

13:31.750 --> 13:32.211
Well...

13:32.377 --> 13:48.199
Probably because the reason I got it at Kenyatta College, when the Africans took over the college and discovered that it was a book about the kukuyu, they did not like the way it was written.

13:48.399 --> 13:51.424
And so that's how I got a hold of it, because it was going to be destroyed.

13:51.464 --> 13:51.804
Right.

13:52.005 --> 13:59.215
Now, just on the book itself, is it a cloth-covered book with a pictorial cover, which normally was the kind of book that would be published that time?

13:59.335 --> 14:01.658
Cloth cover, but it has nothing on the cover at all.

14:01.638 --> 14:07.588
Really, most probably what you have is the trade copy, not the deluxe copy.

14:07.628 --> 14:13.397
Because quite frankly, we handle a lot of books pertaining to the history of Africa, colonialism, etc.

14:13.738 --> 14:18.706
And the majority of the books of that time period usually are issued with a pictorial cover.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.529
Robert, we've got to take a slight break.

14:20.549 --> 14:24.736
We're going to leave you on the line and solve the problem of the kukuyu in just a moment.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.599
We're the book guys.

14:56.347 --> 14:58.891
We're the book guys, Alan Stipek, and I'm Mike Cuthbert.

14:58.951 --> 15:07.004
Robert has challenged us with a book written in Africa by William Scoresby Rutledge, or W. Scoresby Rutledge, I guess I'm assuming the William.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.670
Alan, what more can you tell us about the likelihood of this book?

15:10.690 --> 15:19.405
He's the brother of Archibald Hannibal Rutledge, who is also a famous author of African Travels, including an American hunter.

15:19.425 --> 15:20.346
Great.

15:20.326 --> 15:28.033
white safari man, and I would hazard a guess that that book is worth somewhere between $35 and $100.

15:28.613 --> 15:39.963
Now, we just picked up a big collection of books on Africa, and quite frankly, it's very interesting to see the difference between books written by the indigenous peoples of that time period, especially in Kenya.

15:40.764 --> 15:47.530
You have writings by Kenyatta when he was in Paris and in London, and by people who were living in Kenya who were white colonialists.

15:47.910 --> 15:50.232
Boy, there are two separate points of views to the country.

15:50.212 --> 15:50.553
For sure.

15:51.095 --> 15:51.437
Oh, yes.

15:51.477 --> 15:54.629
Well, I've read Kenyatta's book, so I'm well aware of that.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.898
But this is different.

15:56.918 --> 16:00.190
This is more like from an anthropologist's point of view.

16:00.211 --> 16:01.656
Yeah, but do you think it's accurate, sir?

16:02.395 --> 16:03.557
I think so, yes.

16:04.157 --> 16:06.060
Okay, you know, you have to do some research.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.423
I would say the book is between $35 to $100.

16:08.583 --> 16:08.804
Okay.

16:09.725 --> 16:11.067
Robert, thank you very much for calling us.

16:11.087 --> 16:11.427
You're welcome.

16:11.447 --> 16:11.928
Thanks a lot.

16:12.328 --> 16:14.171
We're the Book Guys in Washington, D.C.

16:14.271 --> 16:15.493
Mike Cuthbert and Alan Steipek.

16:15.513 --> 16:19.298
We're talking used and rare books, and you can see how it goes.

16:19.498 --> 16:21.140
It gets very unusual.

16:21.701 --> 16:23.343
Let's go to Boca Raton in Florida.

16:23.444 --> 16:25.246
Max, you're on with the Book Guys.

16:25.306 --> 16:26.007
Hello to you.

16:28.012 --> 16:29.034
Hello, Max.

16:29.054 --> 16:29.414
Are you there?

16:29.475 --> 16:29.975
There he is.

16:30.116 --> 16:30.396
Sure.

16:30.416 --> 16:31.177
Yes, I'm here.

16:31.298 --> 16:32.660
Didn't punch the button hard enough.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.383
Oh, all right.

16:34.503 --> 16:35.245
Now I'm here.

16:35.265 --> 16:36.126
What have you got for us?

16:36.988 --> 16:51.673
I have here a four-volume set of translation of Don Quixote de la Mancha, translated by somebody called Motteux, M-O-T-T-E-U-X.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.648
And published in Boston by Little Brown and Company in 1854.

16:56.788 --> 17:06.287
It's four octavo volumes, leather bound, in a sort of tan leather.

17:06.773 --> 17:13.789
Gee, there's only one of possibly 2,000 different editions of Don Quixote published between 1840 and 1875.

17:13.889 --> 17:14.510
Really?

17:14.530 --> 17:18.620
Very popular book written in the 19th century.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.085
Very popular book written in the 17th century.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.192
And then the 20th century.

17:24.172 --> 17:30.220
It sounds like it's just a general reading copy of one of the many translations with an illustrator.

17:30.280 --> 17:38.751
The name doesn't really strike a bell as being a highly collectible book, and I would hazard a guess that it's probably worth because of the leather.

17:38.831 --> 17:39.912
Is the leather in good condition?

17:40.713 --> 17:42.075
Reasonable for the age.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.497
Okay, and the size of the book, sir?

17:43.628 --> 17:45.130
Octavo.

17:46.011 --> 17:46.552
It's funny.

17:46.572 --> 17:51.218
If you could give me two minutes, let me explain what's happened with the definition of book sizes.

17:51.819 --> 17:56.425
Book sizes used to be defined by the actual pagination of the book.

17:56.765 --> 17:59.889
An octavo was eight pages to a signature.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.935
Now, everybody out there who doesn't know what a signature is, that's how a book is bound.

18:04.235 --> 18:05.637
It's bound in signatures.

18:05.617 --> 18:08.160
And that's the paper folded over.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.665
Now a quarto would be bound in signatures of four pages each.

18:13.125 --> 18:20.653
Now they're taking books by the size, and they actually even have a ruler, which actually tells you the size of the book by using the ruler.

18:20.693 --> 18:24.557
So a book that's X amount of inches in height is now a folio.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.319
If it's a little small, it's a quarto.

18:26.620 --> 18:32.586
If it's smaller, then that's an octavo, down all the way down to the itsy bitsy 64mo, or the miniature books.

18:32.566 --> 18:35.351
And now, to me, that's the improper way of defining a book.

18:35.691 --> 18:39.277
A book is defined by size, by the pagination, by the signatures.

18:39.798 --> 18:44.505
So when you say octavo, are you talking about the size of the book or by the signatures?

18:44.706 --> 18:49.253
Well, the page size is four and a half inches by seven inches.

18:49.273 --> 18:53.460
Well, yeah, that would be, at this point, a regular octavo.

18:54.482 --> 18:56.565
But that's by its size.

18:56.765 --> 18:57.747
Now...

18:58.604 --> 19:00.526
See, he's being a purist with you, Matt.

19:00.546 --> 19:03.649
Yeah, I am being a purist, and I'm not trying to sound condescending.

19:03.669 --> 19:16.682
It's just a very peculiar problem that booksellers have when they're cataloging because you're going to have one person who identifies a book in a catalog as being an octavo by size when, in fact, it could be a quarto or a royal quarto in its real sense.

19:17.103 --> 19:22.288
But the bottom line is the book you have is probably worth between $100 to $250 if the leather's in good condition.

19:22.809 --> 19:23.169
Oh, good.

19:23.389 --> 19:23.709
All right.

19:24.090 --> 19:24.791
Thank you very much.

19:24.891 --> 19:26.372
Thank you very much, Max.

19:26.853 --> 19:26.953
Okay.

19:26.973 --> 19:27.193
Good night.

19:27.359 --> 19:28.020
Good night.

19:28.160 --> 19:34.467
Every week at around this time, about the middle of our program, we're going to bring you somebody very, very special.

19:35.569 --> 19:40.114
Nicholas Basbaines is going to join us because... Whoa!

19:40.534 --> 19:40.915
Hello.

19:43.398 --> 19:53.029
Nick has written a book that is, I don't know which printing, we'll find out from him, but it's a fascinating book called A Gentle Madness, and it's all about collecting books.

19:53.161 --> 19:56.024
Nick is in his home in Boston, Massachusetts.

19:56.044 --> 19:57.026
He joins the book guys.

19:57.126 --> 19:59.368
Nick, how are you?

19:59.388 --> 20:00.310
I'm fine, Mike.

20:00.330 --> 20:00.670
How are you?

20:00.910 --> 20:01.992
Very good to have you with us.

20:02.212 --> 20:02.512
Hi, Nick.

20:02.913 --> 20:03.493
Hi, Al.

20:03.513 --> 20:06.076
It's a pleasure to be with the book guys tonight.

20:06.397 --> 20:19.152
Now, every week you're going to just give us a visit into your world, tell us some stories about either book collectors that you know, book collecting that is going on, or you can even dip into your own book if you would like to tell some of the stories like

20:19.132 --> 20:22.217
Well, I must admit, the greatest story in your book about St.

20:22.237 --> 20:24.520
Cuthbert, but we'll get to that another time.

20:25.161 --> 20:28.046
What's happening in your world that you'd like to share with us this week, Nick?

20:28.306 --> 20:28.947
Cute story.

20:28.987 --> 20:40.064
I was signing books this past weekend at the Boston Antiquarian Book Fair up here, and at one time I had a nice long line.

20:40.084 --> 20:42.428
I must have had 15 or 20 people waiting for books.

20:43.309 --> 20:47.856
And this young man, I would guess about 12 years old, came right to the front,

20:48.325 --> 20:49.246
and asked me a question.

20:49.266 --> 20:50.107
He said, excuse me.

20:50.127 --> 20:52.330
He said, do I have to buy something to get a signature?

20:53.712 --> 20:54.233
And I looked at him.

20:54.293 --> 20:56.155
I said, do I look like Reggie Jackson?

20:56.316 --> 20:57.437
Do I look like Greg Maddox?

20:58.679 --> 21:01.703
Would you like me to... But it's kind of cute, isn't it?

21:02.384 --> 21:03.085
Incredible.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.426
I signed a card for him.

21:04.446 --> 21:06.830
I even asked him his name, and I asked him if he liked books.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.071
Hold that thought for just a minute.

21:08.111 --> 21:10.975
We have to tell folks that we're the book guys in Washington.

21:11.748 --> 21:12.790
Okay, go ahead, Nick.

21:13.291 --> 21:19.942
Now, at that same signing, what do people talk about when they ask you to sign their book?

21:19.962 --> 21:21.043
They haven't even read it yet.

21:21.224 --> 21:22.025
Why are they getting it?

21:22.686 --> 21:24.549
A number of people, I have to say.

21:24.569 --> 21:35.207
I was on an interview with Brian Lamb on C-SPAN, which aired about a month ago, and it's amazing how many people watched that program and indicated that they had

21:35.727 --> 21:52.102
They had seen me there, and many of them had even already purchased the book and were there to get first editions because the ABAA, which sponsors these book fairs, had the foresight, I guess, to buy up quite a few first editions of my book, which has now gone into the fourth printing.

21:53.263 --> 21:56.346
And so they were there to get signed first editions.

21:56.807 --> 22:02.332
How does it feel, Nick, to know that your first edition signed is now selling for more than the published price?

22:02.692 --> 22:03.793
And how long has your book been out?

22:04.280 --> 22:07.949
The book was published officially in August.

22:08.029 --> 22:09.773
It was available in late July.

22:09.793 --> 22:14.424
As I understand it, the first printing was gone within three days.

22:15.467 --> 22:19.757
While we were still within our first month of publication, there were three printings ordered.

22:20.041 --> 22:20.682
That's your question.

22:20.702 --> 22:21.764
It's wonderful.

22:21.784 --> 22:22.345
I see.

22:22.545 --> 22:30.217
So, you know, I can just tell you that Second Story is cataloging your first edition now for more than the list price, and people are desperate for copies of it.

22:30.978 --> 22:32.060
Music to my ears.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.524
Speaking of Second Story, I'm going to Toledo this week.

22:35.205 --> 22:35.666
Question.

22:35.686 --> 22:36.447
Okay, quiz.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.244
What's the first thing you do when you go into a city you've never been into before?

22:40.745 --> 22:41.205
Personally?

22:41.265 --> 22:42.247
Yeah.

22:42.307 --> 22:43.168
Go to a bookstore.

22:43.328 --> 22:43.728
What else?

22:44.109 --> 22:46.131
It sounds like a setup.

22:46.151 --> 22:50.476
No, the first thing I do is I check the yellow pages to find out where all the bookstores are.

22:50.657 --> 22:54.021
The first thing I do is double-check to make sure my hotel room has a king-size bed.

22:54.481 --> 22:56.624
I would say the first thing I do is check into my hotel.

22:56.684 --> 23:02.471
But, I mean, I think the real book nut always wants to know where the second-hand bookstores are.

23:02.491 --> 23:04.493
I love the second-hand bookstores.

23:04.709 --> 23:09.237
And the antiquarian guys, I know who they are, and I'll see them later.

23:09.297 --> 23:13.304
But, boy, you go to those second-hand places, you never know what you're going to find.

23:13.644 --> 23:16.188
And I'm going to Toledo this weekend.

23:16.329 --> 23:18.332
And what are you doing in Toledo, Nick?

23:19.634 --> 23:21.618
Well, he asked and he answered.

23:21.958 --> 23:27.868
I've been invited out there by the friends of the Toledo Public Library to talk about my book.

23:27.888 --> 23:30.092
I write a weekly book column.

23:30.663 --> 23:44.688
That's carried, it's syndicated in 25 newspapers or so, and I write about new books and authors, so the blade out there in Toledo takes my column, and so I'm kind of known out there, I guess, and I'll be out there talking about a gentle madness.

23:45.149 --> 23:47.854
I hope you'll bring us some stories from Toledo when you come.

23:48.074 --> 23:48.996
It would be my pleasure.

23:49.156 --> 23:50.919
All right, Nick, good luck, and thanks for joining us.

23:50.959 --> 23:52.422
We'll see you next week at the same time.

23:52.622 --> 23:53.404
Thanks, Mike.

23:53.424 --> 23:53.684
Thanks, Alan.

23:53.704 --> 23:54.105
Good luck.

23:54.085 --> 23:54.546
Bye-bye.

23:54.706 --> 24:00.914
Nick Basbane is author of A Gentle Madness, a book about collectors through history, published by Henry Holt.

24:00.954 --> 24:02.095
You know, I'd say something about Nick.

24:02.395 --> 24:08.964
I just have to tell you, since he's come on the scene with this book, he has breathed such a breath of fresh air into book collecting.

24:09.024 --> 24:16.513
He is so overwhelmed by the market and by everybody who collects books that he's made us more aware of who we are.

24:17.034 --> 24:19.637
And, I mean, I just got to tell you that...

24:19.617 --> 24:22.282
To see him sign a book, he just doesn't sign your book.

24:22.322 --> 24:23.904
He inscribes every book.

24:24.165 --> 24:29.354
And I've seen him online with 100 people, and he has spent three to five minutes coming up with an inscription.

24:29.774 --> 24:35.905
And the last time in Boston, he said, you know, inscribing books takes a lot of time, you know, but he still does it.

24:36.509 --> 24:39.913
We're going to take more calls in just a moment here at The Book Guys.

24:40.114 --> 24:43.818
Our number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

24:43.838 --> 24:48.084
And you use that number simply to call, register your name, and the book that you've got.

24:48.144 --> 24:51.208
When you call, just give us the title, the author, and the publisher.

24:51.548 --> 24:57.616
The year would be helpful as well to help guide us a little bit as to what's happening with your books.

24:57.656 --> 25:03.343
We'll then get you on the radio in the next week or so, and you'll be part of The Book Guys.

25:03.323 --> 25:06.773
As a matter of fact, we're the book guys in Washington.

25:08.358 --> 25:09.481
Let's go to Massachusetts.

25:09.782 --> 25:11.888
And Gene, you're on with the book guys.

25:12.068 --> 25:12.630
Hello to you.

25:13.834 --> 25:14.475
Gene, are you there?

25:15.699 --> 25:16.281
Hello, Gene.

25:17.364 --> 25:18.447
Let me try once again.

25:19.473 --> 25:20.214
There she is.

25:20.415 --> 25:20.956
I'm right here.

25:21.036 --> 25:21.557
There you go.

25:21.597 --> 25:22.218
Jean, go ahead.

25:22.338 --> 25:22.598
Thanks.

25:23.300 --> 25:31.173
My father has given my husband a two-volume set of a handbook of American Indians, and he handed it over as though it had some value.

25:31.674 --> 25:38.005
And we wondered if maybe Al could help us describe a monetary...

25:38.677 --> 25:42.081
value to my father's love for my husband.

25:42.221 --> 25:44.423
Are we talking Catlin's Handbook of American Indies?

25:44.443 --> 25:45.764
This is not Catlin's, no.

25:45.985 --> 25:55.474
This is a Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology, printed in 1907 in Washington.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.256
Okay, it's got the green bindings?

25:57.396 --> 25:58.417
No, it's tan.

25:58.438 --> 26:04.023
They're both two tan leather bindings with what looks like vellum inserts.

26:04.043 --> 26:04.564
Really?

26:04.764 --> 26:07.587
The spines are tan leather in exquisite condition.

26:07.955 --> 26:12.584
And there are about 2,200 pages worth of, but there is a two-volume set.

26:12.604 --> 26:12.785
Wow.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.686
You know what that sounds like?

26:13.727 --> 26:20.640
That sounds like every year the Bureau of American Ethnology comes out through the Smithsonian with a handbook on American Indians.

26:20.681 --> 26:22.584
And that went from about J.D.

26:22.665 --> 26:23.606
Powell, J.W.

26:23.626 --> 26:24.288
Powell, excuse me.

26:24.308 --> 26:24.428
Right.

26:24.408 --> 26:27.251
was the compiler, the editor.

26:27.552 --> 26:34.920
And I believe it started in about 1879 and went through about 1916 and then sporadically has been issued under another editing head.

26:35.841 --> 26:46.213
They sell the individual annual years, will sell anywhere from $25 for a bulletin up to $250 for a bulletin.

26:46.193 --> 26:52.824
An individual volume like the one on the Hopi dolls or the Kachina dolls sells now up to about $500.

26:52.844 --> 27:00.757
And then other ones just on Indian dresses or Indian dances, Indian music, will sell for $150 to $250.

27:01.118 --> 27:10.193
It sounds like what you have is a compilation of a variety of the years that were issued prior to 1907 in a deluxe binding by the Smithsonian.

27:10.173 --> 27:11.615
And I'm going to hazard a guess.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.338
I mean, I really think that's what you have.

27:13.698 --> 27:17.784
And if that's the case, I would say it's probably worth... This is a leather set?

27:17.804 --> 27:18.024
Yes, it is.

27:18.044 --> 27:19.466
I would say it's worth at least $400.

27:19.506 --> 27:20.087
Wonderful.

27:21.670 --> 27:22.411
Now, wait a minute.

27:22.491 --> 27:25.034
The government printed something that's worth $400?

27:25.175 --> 27:27.798
Well, the government printed stuff that was worth more than $400.

27:27.939 --> 27:30.222
I mean, this is a remarkable set of books.

27:30.943 --> 27:34.408
If you had the whole collection, you would probably be looking at...

27:34.388 --> 27:37.455
A $10,000 investment, $15,000 investment.

27:37.756 --> 27:42.788
Another example of the government printing something that's very valuable are the Pacific Railroad surveys.

27:43.149 --> 27:52.752
Fifteen volumes that came out in 1852 to 1855 with color plates in the back of the birds that were indigenous to the southwest.

27:52.732 --> 27:58.022
Again, Indian textiles, animals.

27:58.904 --> 28:02.251
Those books now sell for the 15 violence for about $4,000.

28:02.451 --> 28:04.616
Jean, what's the subject of this handbook?

28:04.636 --> 28:07.281
Is it all Indians, or is there a special feature in 1907?

28:07.321 --> 28:07.922
No.

28:07.902 --> 28:09.324
No, it's all Indians.

28:09.424 --> 28:17.973
It's an alphabetical listing through two volumes of, I suppose, every known tribe or group.

28:17.993 --> 28:19.975
But they're North American.

28:20.516 --> 28:21.898
These are North American Indians.

28:22.198 --> 28:23.659
Right, so that's what Powell's was.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.181
Is it edited by Powell's by any chance?

28:25.822 --> 28:29.826
The first volume, it is edited by Frederick Webb Hodge.

28:31.608 --> 28:33.150
And it doesn't say Powell's at all?

28:33.653 --> 28:35.295
Not on this particular one, no.

28:35.435 --> 28:35.816
Okay.

28:36.857 --> 28:38.259
I'm still going to stand by my price.

28:38.279 --> 28:41.163
I'm pretty sure that's what it would sell for, about $400.

28:41.203 --> 28:42.044
Well, great.

28:42.064 --> 28:42.745
Thank you very much.

28:42.845 --> 28:43.767
Thank you very much.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.930
Good night.

28:46.010 --> 28:53.620
The curious thing, I guess, to me is I've seen some of these handbooks, and most of them are in a very businesslike green cloth binding, not very exciting.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.882
And yet we've got leather here.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.486
The government does the leather, huh?

28:57.506 --> 28:57.746
Oh, sure.

28:57.786 --> 29:05.117
They had special bindings that were issued to subscribers or to special people in leather, or, in fact, a person could have rebounded in leather after the fact.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.622
I have just opened up and found the book, okay?

29:08.642 --> 29:16.213
And, in fact, it is published by the Bureau of American Anthology, and it was bulleted number 30, and it came out in 1907, and the final binding was 1910.

29:16.974 --> 29:18.256
All right, so one of the later ones.

29:18.997 --> 29:20.299
Let's go to...

29:20.633 --> 29:21.298
Let's see.

29:21.802 --> 29:25.429
Well, first of all, let's just remind you that we're the book guys.

29:57.877 --> 30:02.722
Alan Stipek, I'm Mike Cuthbert, the Book Guys in Washington, D.C., going to Virginia.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.304
And Sally, are you there?

30:04.544 --> 30:05.345
Yes, I sure am.

30:05.365 --> 30:05.845
Hi, Sally.

30:05.865 --> 30:06.646
What have you got for us?

30:06.686 --> 30:06.886
Hi, Sally.

30:07.447 --> 30:07.587
Hi.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.168
Well, I've got a volume here.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.371
It might actually comprise two volumes.

30:11.411 --> 30:12.252
I'm not really sure.

30:15.415 --> 30:20.019
The Poetry of Samuel Johnson and also the Poetry of John Pomfret.

30:20.980 --> 30:24.364
And these were published by C. Cook, No.

30:24.384 --> 30:26.466
17, Paternaster Row in London.

30:27.104 --> 30:33.471
They've got engraved, as I say, it's one volume, but from a listing that's in the back of the book.

30:33.531 --> 30:40.059
It appears that originally these were sold in separate editions, published at either six pence or a shilling apiece.

30:40.459 --> 30:41.700
So those are poor man's editions.

30:42.061 --> 30:46.746
Yeah, actually they even describe it as, let me see here.

30:47.647 --> 30:49.329
Common folk edition?

30:49.769 --> 30:53.133
Plan of Cook's Uniform Cheap and Elegant Pocket Library.

30:53.614 --> 30:53.854
Right, okay.
