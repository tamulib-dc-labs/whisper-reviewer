This is the library of Pope Pius VII Pius VII Pius VII Pius VII Why are these books here?

00:16.893 --> 00:32.772
Pius VII was from Cesena His family was Chiaramonti's family from Cesena But don't the Pope's books go into the Vatican library?

00:33.376 --> 00:40.939
Yes, but Pius VII was the Pope of Napoleon.

00:41.273 --> 00:46.980
who was prisoner of Napoleon in French.

00:47.741 --> 01:05.382
And when we returned in Italy, his library was brought in, had brought in Cesena.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.407
It's a magnificent library.

01:09.674 --> 01:16.241
Yes, he had a lot of beautiful business.

01:17.122 --> 01:19.144
Was he a bibliophile?

01:19.264 --> 01:20.125
No, no.

01:23.229 --> 01:26.793
He was interested in archaeology.

01:27.914 --> 01:33.640
So how did he come to collect these books?

01:35.780 --> 01:39.326
present, a lot of gifts.

01:43.634 --> 01:48.443
And these cabinets are his or they were created for the library?

01:48.783 --> 01:50.126
Yes, but in 1941.

01:50.226 --> 01:59.863
So you are responsible for this library too?

02:00.215 --> 02:07.726
Yes, but the property of the Pius was to the state.

02:07.746 --> 02:09.108
It is to the state.

02:09.268 --> 02:25.952
It's a state library deposited in... Very interesting.

02:28.008 --> 02:34.817
And how long has this been the public library for the city?

02:34.937 --> 02:36.640
At the beginning of 19th century.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.986
1810.

02:48.156 --> 02:55.786
That's great.

02:55.806 --> 02:56.547
That's the vulgar.

02:58.248 --> 03:02.376
Are there any... Where did he get all these soldiers?

03:02.457 --> 03:04.501
Where did the Pope get all of these?

03:04.521 --> 03:06.084
These were given to him too, you think?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.288
These were presents, these books?

03:08.308 --> 03:16.505
No, no, the core books didn't come from the Pope.

03:16.806 --> 03:18.389

03:18.449 --> 03:19.952

03:20.202 --> 03:30.252
were on right from Cacivel, on left from Cardinal Bessarion.

03:34.916 --> 03:37.059

03:38.000 --> 03:47.068
