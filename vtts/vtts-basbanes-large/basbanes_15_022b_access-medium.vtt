00:03.203 --> 00:04.365
Congratulations, Joe.

00:04.385 --> 00:05.566
Joe Finder.

00:08.630 --> 00:12.155
You changed publishing houses, by the way, with Viking to Valentine's.

00:12.175 --> 00:12.295
Right.

00:12.315 --> 00:20.045
That was a... It was actually not a... It wasn't a traumatic thing.

00:21.767 --> 00:32.822
I only had a one-book contract with Viking, and so my agent gave it to Viking, and they offered good money, actually more than the Moscow Club, and

00:33.410 --> 00:35.192
Then there was an auction.

00:35.332 --> 00:41.657
Putnam and Ballantyne and Viking were all involved.

00:42.078 --> 00:51.786
So Linda Gray had just moved to Ballantyne from Bantam.

00:51.806 --> 00:53.248
Really was hot for the book.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.811
So she paid a lot.

00:57.852 --> 00:59.813
But I miss Viking, I have to say, honestly.

01:00.914 --> 01:01.695
I like them a lot.

01:02.300 --> 01:20.284
Tell me a bit about, I mean, I know your background, but your background is so, it's not unsuited for the, certainly for the subject that you bring to this, but the fact that you're writing thrillers now, classy, nice, nicely written thriller.

01:20.304 --> 01:21.626
But you're a thriller writer now.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.127
That's right.

01:22.147 --> 01:22.968
This is your profession.

01:23.008 --> 01:23.709
Yeah.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.671
You're not teaching anymore, are you?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.093
I have not taught since 89.

01:28.315 --> 01:30.518
And I love what I'm doing.

01:31.443 --> 01:37.290
And what do you want me to tell you about your background?

01:37.390 --> 01:40.374
Well, tell me about your background.

01:40.394 --> 01:41.816
I know I've got it in the previous story.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.178
I have to move on to find it.

01:43.218 --> 01:43.979
But tell me about it.

01:43.999 --> 01:44.439
Oh, sure.

01:44.459 --> 01:45.781
Okay.

01:47.663 --> 01:53.230
I grew up, first of all, briefly, in Afghanistan and the Philippines.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.855
We traveled a lot in my childhood.

01:56.975 --> 02:00.319
And I was a Russian studies major at Yale.

02:00.890 --> 02:10.103
and went right to graduate school at Harvard, to the Russian Research Center, to study Soviet politics and foreign policy.

02:10.123 --> 02:22.481
And I took a leave after the first year to write Red Carpet, this nonfiction book that no one read.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.164
It was published on the list.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.966
It was published.

02:25.986 --> 02:27.809
It sold 13,000 copies.

02:27.889 --> 02:30.593
Nothing wrong with that.

02:31.332 --> 02:36.739
And it was, you know, I was 24 years old when it was published, and it was a... That's extraordinary.

02:36.759 --> 02:44.709
Yeah, and it was, in a sense, I think it was... I'm happy with the book, but you know how it is.

02:44.769 --> 02:46.331
You can always do better.

02:47.313 --> 02:48.574
What year was this?

02:48.634 --> 02:48.855
83.

02:49.716 --> 02:52.580
And what I do know is that I was pretty young to do it.

02:52.620 --> 02:56.164
I was pretty too young to actually go through the publishing experience, because this was really tough.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.607
Libel threat from Dr. Armand Hammer.

02:58.988 --> 02:59.128
Mm-hmm.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.523
I remember that.

03:03.284 --> 03:09.650
He had Louis Neisser publish an op-ed piece in the New York Times threatening me in veiled terms.

03:10.471 --> 03:10.971
In print?

03:11.171 --> 03:11.612
In print.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.814
He threatened my publisher.

03:15.236 --> 03:19.580
What was the bone of contention?

03:19.600 --> 03:28.609
Well, this was the first book that had been done about, this was the first book on Armand Hammer that he had not commissioned or written himself.

03:28.977 --> 03:31.580
Had he read any of it, or is this just here?

03:31.841 --> 03:32.281
Yeah, yeah.

03:32.301 --> 03:44.857
Well, I had done an investigative take on him, and I found a lot of very interesting things about Hammer, and things that he wanted to keep concealed, a lot of stuff.

03:44.877 --> 03:48.681
And I laid it right out, and every word in that book is true.

03:48.782 --> 03:49.743
Everything is documented.

03:50.444 --> 03:52.246
Well, there were no lawsuits, were there?

03:52.266 --> 03:55.710
There were no lawsuits, but the most powerful thing you can do is threaten a lawsuit.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.073
If you're a rich, powerful guy like Hammer, you threaten them.

03:58.660 --> 04:03.445
Well, you know, I think it's a good thing.

04:03.525 --> 04:05.827
It's a good thing.

04:05.947 --> 04:08.190
It's a good thing.

04:08.210 --> 04:10.032
It's a good thing.

04:10.432 --> 04:12.314
It's a good thing.

04:12.634 --> 04:14.096
It's a good thing.

04:14.456 --> 04:17.279
It's a good thing.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.623
It's a good thing.

04:22.544 --> 04:23.926
It's a good thing.

04:24.747 --> 04:28.110
It's a good thing.

04:28.428 --> 04:39.062
And so after I published Red Carpet, I started writing for other newspapers, magazine, Wall Street Journal, New Republic, places like that.

04:39.803 --> 04:45.451
And I really couldn't make it freelance and started teaching writing at Harvard.

04:47.113 --> 04:48.154
I taught there for five years.

04:48.835 --> 04:54.002
And I really taught there until, I think, the program began to fall apart.

04:54.223 --> 04:55.404
You might have heard stories.

04:55.484 --> 04:56.005
No, I haven't.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.173
That's a whole separate subject.

04:58.273 --> 05:02.240
Expository writing, they forced the head out, forced Richard Marius out.

05:02.280 --> 05:02.640
He's gone?

05:03.642 --> 05:04.323
He's gone.

05:05.685 --> 05:05.805
Yeah.

05:05.825 --> 05:06.787
In confidence.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.229
Since when?

05:08.369 --> 05:09.752
Since January, I guess.

05:09.992 --> 05:12.817
Is there an expository writing program still?

05:13.017 --> 05:13.678
Yes, there is.

05:14.259 --> 05:15.621
But he's not the head of the name.

05:15.641 --> 05:16.623
Who took it?

05:16.643 --> 05:18.266
Well, they're looking for a director right now.

05:18.286 --> 05:19.748
They're probably going to give it to the associate director.

05:19.768 --> 05:21.030
But the place is in chaos.

05:22.090 --> 05:24.954
I'm sorry to hear that, because I know Marius is a nice guy.

05:24.974 --> 05:27.237
Obviously, I don't know him that well, because this is news to me.

05:27.257 --> 05:29.440
Yeah, yeah.

05:29.781 --> 05:35.749
But also in 89, I sold the Moscow Club, and I had sort of given myself a couple of years.

05:35.769 --> 05:36.510
Got it in 89?

05:36.530 --> 05:37.511
Oh, you sold it in 89.

05:37.591 --> 05:39.995
I sold it in 89.

05:40.516 --> 05:50.950
And they sold it to eventually 30 countries, and so I was able to, and that was good money, and I was able to quit Harvard and start off on my own.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.227
and writing full-time.

05:52.247 --> 05:53.408
So I've been writing full-time since 1989.

05:53.428 --> 05:54.949
That's wonderful.

05:55.250 --> 06:02.096
But for me, if you ask, is there anything sort of discordant about my background, don't forget, I do nonfiction.

06:02.116 --> 06:05.479
I do sort of serious nonfiction as well as entertainment.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.200
And you continue to do this series now?

06:07.220 --> 06:07.941
Oh, absolutely.

06:08.041 --> 06:11.905
You did have a piece in the New York Times about, I don't know, a year or so ago.

06:11.925 --> 06:13.726
I write, yeah, I review for them pretty regularly.

06:14.467 --> 06:20.312
Whenever there's a book on espionage or intelligence or Russia,

06:20.613 --> 06:21.394
that sort of thing.

06:22.135 --> 06:26.662
I've reviewed for them, including a couple of, at least one cover review, one semi-cover review.

06:26.682 --> 06:29.827
I remember the cover review.

06:29.867 --> 06:38.860
So I sort of keep my hand in, partly because I love writing nonfiction, but also partly because it sort of bolsters my fiction.

06:39.180 --> 06:43.667
It's synergy, one reinforces the other.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.812
Well, it gives you a credibility, too.

06:45.832 --> 06:46.473
Well, that, too.

06:46.673 --> 06:47.494
I can't deny that.

06:47.654 --> 06:52.439
I assume it also gives you access to sources.

06:52.599 --> 06:53.180
Absolutely.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.583
I mean, you thank sources here.

06:57.284 --> 07:00.648
It seems to me that they were very helpful.

07:00.768 --> 07:05.133
Authenticity, clearly, is a very important issue.

07:05.153 --> 07:12.321
Yeah, and I've got friends in CIA and FBI and...

07:13.229 --> 07:17.655
other intelligence agencies and the government and private sector.

07:18.115 --> 07:22.101
All that stuff really makes a difference when you're writing a book, I think.

07:22.662 --> 07:42.628
And so basically I get to write serious, there's this sort of graduate student academic, call it the academic side of me, which writes nonfiction pieces for the New Republic, Times Literary Supplement, New York Times Book Review,

07:42.963 --> 07:50.491
And then there's the other part of me, which is the entertainer, which sort of feeds on that underpinning, in a sense.

07:50.511 --> 07:54.576
Did you know you had this knack for storytelling in there?

07:55.938 --> 08:01.163
Yeah, I did, but I was scared to make the leap for a long time.

08:02.825 --> 08:05.648
I like this just as much, if not better.

08:06.850 --> 08:07.230
Thank you.

08:07.290 --> 08:09.513
I like this a lot better.

08:10.214 --> 08:12.396
The writing's a lot better.

08:12.595 --> 08:18.921
I think maybe you did one or two more drafts here.

08:18.961 --> 08:19.562
Maybe I'm wrong.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.042
I don't know.

08:20.182 --> 08:22.624
Not true, but I grew as a writer.

08:22.644 --> 08:23.766
Well, that's what I see.

08:24.406 --> 08:27.209
And you write in a word processor?

08:27.569 --> 08:28.290
Yeah, I do.

08:29.211 --> 08:31.533
I can sense that for some reason.

08:31.613 --> 08:34.295
There are things that you see in the editing.

08:34.315 --> 08:35.937
Go ahead.

08:36.237 --> 08:38.860
Bob Parker just started writing with a word processor.

08:38.940 --> 08:39.400
I saw it.

08:40.381 --> 08:42.383
He said he'd never give up the old typewriter.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.717
You think it's better for writing or worse?

08:45.398 --> 08:46.359
I think it's better.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.361
I think it is, too.

08:47.722 --> 08:50.807
But, you know, what I have to do... I don't know exactly what you're saying.

08:50.827 --> 08:51.328
No, no, no.

08:51.368 --> 08:54.493
The number two pencil is sacred, but no, I think it's better.

08:54.513 --> 09:00.744
No, what I do is I print out, I do hard copy, as they call it, print it out, and I edit with a pencil.

09:01.726 --> 09:06.514
So I really believe that you have to edit it by looking at the hard copy and not looking at it on the screen.

09:06.534 --> 09:08.337
There was a study at MIT about this that

09:08.654 --> 09:18.665
that indicates that there's a difference between the transmitted image, i.e., the PC, and the reflected image, which is what we see on the page.

09:18.765 --> 09:20.808
And at the reflected image, we perceive it differently.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.170
There's no question about it.

09:23.190 --> 09:25.513
I don't have to be part of a study to validate it for you.

09:25.533 --> 09:30.819
I mean, I've been writing for print for 20 years, and I have to see it in hard copy.

09:31.199 --> 09:32.000
And it looks different.

09:32.060 --> 09:32.881
It sounds different.

09:32.901 --> 09:33.962
You see mistakes.

09:34.042 --> 09:37.446
My columns now that I'm sending my modem, I was telling my wife, I said,

09:37.797 --> 09:41.120
It's possible to do this and never see it on paper until it's printed.

09:41.221 --> 09:41.481
Right.

09:41.501 --> 09:42.942
But I print it out.

09:42.962 --> 09:43.082
Right.

09:43.103 --> 09:45.825
I have to, because then I start to see the way it's going to look at type.

09:46.286 --> 09:46.786
Yeah.

09:46.806 --> 09:48.188
And quotes look different.

09:48.308 --> 09:48.768
Absolutely.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.410
What people say looks different.

09:50.971 --> 09:51.071
Yeah.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.272
And they'll say, I say that.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.373
I've got tape now.

09:53.633 --> 09:54.354
I say no shit.

09:54.374 --> 09:55.295
You didn't say that.

09:55.315 --> 09:55.415
Yeah.

09:55.555 --> 09:55.896
Yeah.

09:56.757 --> 09:58.919
But maybe you didn't think it would look like that.

09:59.059 --> 09:59.319
Right.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.442
No, so I print out.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.264
But with this book.

10:05.246 --> 10:06.707
Yeah, it does.

10:08.324 --> 10:11.047
I really sort of let myself go.

10:12.649 --> 10:20.979
You see, Moscow Club was my first book, and I like it a lot and all that, but it was my apprentice effort in a lot of ways.

10:21.239 --> 10:30.851
However, you did gain a certain cachet by having, in a way, predicted the demise of the Soviet Union, and that is something that you kind of have to live up to, isn't it?

10:30.871 --> 10:31.391
Yeah.

10:31.411 --> 10:35.496
I'm sure people are looking at this and saying, well, is this really what's going on?

10:37.332 --> 10:41.376
I don't know if you finished the book, but I don't want to wreck this book.

10:41.396 --> 10:41.636
No, don't.

10:41.997 --> 10:43.718
I haven't finished it.

10:44.299 --> 10:45.240
But I will say this much.

10:45.460 --> 10:59.494
I think I will not wreck it for you, but the resolution of this book, the whole plot centers on the revelation that there is a high-level KGB mole in the CIA after the Cold War is over.

10:59.514 --> 11:01.756
I can use that in print, then, you think?

11:01.776 --> 11:01.957
Yes.

11:02.637 --> 11:03.458
Yeah, that's okay.

11:03.657 --> 11:09.365
And the timing for the Ames thing could not be better because the Ames case broke.

11:09.385 --> 11:10.626
We may even have our lead here.

11:10.687 --> 11:11.528
Yeah, yeah.

11:11.968 --> 11:16.735
The week this book shipped, the Ames case broke.

11:16.795 --> 11:17.997
It's amazing, isn't it?

11:18.017 --> 11:18.117
Yeah.

11:18.157 --> 11:21.261
In fact, there are a lot of... It's totally coincidental.

11:21.321 --> 11:25.226
I mean, I didn't have any inside knowledge when I was writing this book.

11:25.246 --> 11:27.950
But the character... Oh, boy.

11:28.351 --> 11:31.154
Well, these maverick killers, though, that's... Well, yeah.

11:31.174 --> 11:31.855
One second.

11:31.996 --> 11:33.057
But the...

11:33.543 --> 11:39.348
The mole in my book turns out to be in CIA.

11:39.368 --> 11:40.349
Well, don't tell me who it is.

11:41.370 --> 11:42.291
I'm afraid to.

11:42.311 --> 11:42.591
All right.

11:43.272 --> 11:44.733
It's very similar to Ames.

11:44.914 --> 11:45.154
It's true.

11:45.174 --> 11:46.715
The population is very similar.

11:46.795 --> 11:47.456
That's all I'll say.

11:47.536 --> 11:48.537
I'll handle it properly.

11:48.557 --> 11:50.158
I'm not writing this for next week, by the way.

11:50.178 --> 11:50.959
Ethan's next week.

11:51.099 --> 11:52.260
You're the week after.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.023
It's better because I'll have another newspaper online by then.

11:55.103 --> 11:56.665
Right, right.

11:57.445 --> 12:00.428
And, yeah, the maverick, you know, the Stassi,

12:00.745 --> 12:02.567
killers and that sort of thing.

12:03.087 --> 12:14.219
This is, you know, the telepathy angle is one thing which I want to talk about, but there are a number of absolute factual underpinnings.

12:14.239 --> 12:15.020
I wish you would talk about that.

12:16.261 --> 12:17.683
Yeah.

12:17.703 --> 12:22.488
The Stassi sort of freelancers, this is now a matter of documented fact.

12:23.889 --> 12:30.516
The CIA has realized that there are really thousands and thousands of

12:31.053 --> 12:37.121
operatives, field agents from the old Soviet bloc who were suddenly unemployed.

12:37.141 --> 12:38.663
Well, I love the epigraph.

12:38.683 --> 12:39.084
It's true.

12:39.364 --> 12:42.408
Is that an actual... Absolutely.

12:42.889 --> 12:43.890
Isn't that amazing?

12:43.910 --> 12:44.411
It's wonderful.

12:44.711 --> 12:50.900
So a lot of these people have their... Some of these guys are working for the Russians.

12:51.701 --> 12:54.044
Some of them are working for... Soldiers of Fortune.

12:54.104 --> 12:54.885
Soldiers of Fortune.

12:54.925 --> 12:56.627
They're working for private industry.

12:58.009 --> 12:58.850
So that's a matter of fact.

12:59.191 --> 13:00.773
The thing about the Russian gold...

13:01.597 --> 13:10.847
It's a matter of fact that the Soviet gold reserves now have dropped from $50 billion to a few billion.

13:10.947 --> 13:22.098
They estimate that $50 billion in Soviet gold was siphoned out of the Soviet Treasury right before the coup, as a matter of fact.

13:22.178 --> 13:24.020
And so I heard that, and I said, oh, thank you.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.021
Was that the premise then?

13:25.181 --> 13:27.584
I mean, was that what gave you the what?

13:27.604 --> 13:27.704
Yeah.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.125
I said, what?

13:28.545 --> 13:31.468
I said, what a great notion for a story.

13:31.735 --> 13:36.943
You're getting this information then that more or less inspired.

13:37.624 --> 13:41.810
This book, did the writing start after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

13:41.931 --> 13:42.151
Yes.

13:42.371 --> 13:47.599
In fact, I started, I haven't actually said this anywhere else, but there's nothing wrong with it.

13:47.699 --> 13:50.343
I started a book and scrapped it.

13:50.664 --> 13:55.291
The guy upstairs, the reason he wrote these short stories, he hit the wall in his novel.

13:57.214 --> 13:58.536
Right, right.

13:58.718 --> 14:01.281
I went back to writing what I know how to do, which is a short story.

14:01.442 --> 14:02.343
Yeah.

14:03.044 --> 14:09.152
Well, I started writing, after I finished Moscow, I started writing.

14:09.412 --> 14:16.822
I went, Michelle and I went to Moscow, and I established connections there with a guy in the black market there.

14:17.603 --> 14:20.767
And I started working on a novel, and I did a lot of research for it.

14:21.488 --> 14:27.055
And then, and my central character was in the KGB, was a hero.

14:27.845 --> 14:29.947
And I really liked this book a lot.

14:29.967 --> 14:35.612
And then the country collapsed, and I said, I'm not getting into this situation.

14:36.133 --> 14:37.354
This is too much mess.

14:37.374 --> 14:38.175
I put it aside.

14:38.195 --> 14:39.096
I'm not throwing it away.

14:39.156 --> 14:41.718
Someday I might use it in some form or another.

14:41.738 --> 14:42.819
The characters might be good.

14:42.839 --> 14:44.040
The characters, the situation.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.502
Maybe it'll be part of a flashback.

14:45.542 --> 14:46.723
Maybe it'll be part of a novel.

14:46.743 --> 14:47.924
I don't know how.

14:48.144 --> 14:54.490
So I started writing this one after the collapse of Russia when I thought, you know.

14:55.692 --> 14:57.193
I truly respect you.

14:57.629 --> 15:03.476
much more for having the wisdom to say, hey, this ain't going to go anywhere.

15:03.496 --> 15:06.219
I mean, Justin Kaplan quit on things.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.942
He really didn't want to quit on, was it, Grant?

15:08.962 --> 15:09.923
Yeah.

15:10.424 --> 15:12.906
But Feeley's book is out there, and it's wonderful.

15:12.947 --> 15:13.367
That's right.

15:13.968 --> 15:14.789
What am I going to do?

15:15.229 --> 15:17.111
David McCullough was doing Picasso.

15:17.131 --> 15:19.634
He says, I hated Picasso.

15:19.674 --> 15:21.676
The more I learned about him, the more I disliked him.

15:21.697 --> 15:23.158
And I said, no, I'm quitting.

15:23.418 --> 15:24.259
That's it.

15:24.279 --> 15:26.202
Going to Eric Truman is what he did.

15:26.662 --> 15:27.383
Good decision.

15:27.532 --> 15:28.613
Yeah, and it's tough to do.

15:28.693 --> 15:35.199
It's really tough to sort of discard something you've been really pouring your heart and soul into.

15:35.219 --> 15:36.940
I think it's a mark of a professional, really.

15:37.921 --> 15:41.344
I think it indicates your growth as a writer.

15:41.404 --> 15:41.524
Yeah.

15:41.584 --> 15:43.366
Don't be embarrassed by admitting to that.

15:43.426 --> 15:45.288
Yeah, but I'm glad I did.

15:45.668 --> 15:57.218
And this sort of sprung, you know, certainly power sprung from a what-if that is, the question really was, so if the Cold War's over, what happens to all the spies?

15:58.396 --> 16:01.940
Of course, you read Le Carre's recently.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.441
I sure did and liked it a lot.

16:03.702 --> 16:06.865
I think it's better than several of his recent books.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.887
I think it's best in the last three or four.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.129
Yes, yes.

16:10.149 --> 16:12.631
It's really written.

16:12.852 --> 16:13.773
Wonderful.

16:14.814 --> 16:24.865
I remember talking to friends in the agency and other places and realizing that the Cold War is over, but the spies are not out of work, that they're going to have to justify their own work.

16:24.885 --> 16:27.087
They're going to have to make trouble.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.366
The spying continues, as we've seen.

16:30.487 --> 16:32.148
So I sort of started with that premise.

16:33.550 --> 16:48.303
And one of the... And I started digging into research into CIA, and I found this mention of a CIA project in telepathy.

16:48.323 --> 16:49.364
Which is the person I didn't believe.

16:49.444 --> 16:50.906
Oh, wow.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.989
So you actually got this from the factual basis?

16:54.009 --> 16:54.469
Absolutely.

16:54.950 --> 16:55.470
There is...

16:56.041 --> 17:05.474
Whenever I mention another study in this book that is documented fact, and... Well, that's cool.

17:05.554 --> 17:11.683
Yeah, let me show you a couple things quickly.

17:12.784 --> 17:15.348
Well, you're getting some pretty heady reviews, Joe, I have to say.

17:15.548 --> 17:18.833
I mean, you're the successor to Ludlum, I think.

17:18.853 --> 17:19.594
That was The Globe.

17:20.535 --> 17:21.857
I started two places.

17:21.877 --> 17:23.600
There was another one out of Chicago.

17:23.820 --> 17:25.322
Yeah.

17:25.437 --> 17:32.467
I don't know, but I know Greek name when I say it.

17:32.488 --> 17:35.652
Yeah, yeah.

17:35.672 --> 17:37.034
I brought this just for you.

17:37.435 --> 17:39.438
Don't forget it.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.022
I'd like to have it.

17:42.482 --> 17:43.264
Anything will help.

17:43.284 --> 17:44.546
In fact, you might mail some stuff.

17:44.566 --> 17:45.126
Yes, I could.

17:45.507 --> 17:46.789
Yes, I could.

17:47.270 --> 17:48.712
You don't have a fax, right?

17:48.792 --> 17:49.092
I do.

17:49.293 --> 17:50.174
You do?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.336
Just my phone number.

17:51.396 --> 17:52.277
Tell me you're calling.

17:53.138 --> 17:53.859
You put the fax on.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.921
Okay, yeah.

17:55.390 --> 18:05.639
When I have two more newspapers, I want to get my own facts.

18:05.659 --> 18:06.160
Yeah, you should.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.921
It's worth it.

18:08.402 --> 18:08.582
I agree.

18:08.602 --> 18:11.104
Especially for the motive, I think.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.345
Yeah, definitely.

18:12.445 --> 18:14.807
So that's one of the things I started to look into.

18:14.847 --> 18:23.355
I was really intrigued by it, and it turned out the more I did research that the KGB had a similar program.

18:23.605 --> 18:34.938
These are really kept very, these are buried, partly out of fear of ridicule, partly because it sort of strains credulity in a lot of ways.

18:35.919 --> 18:42.567
But as I mentioned in this book, the Defense Department has, I believe in it myself too.

18:42.587 --> 18:44.789
I've got a personal experience, I'll tell you how to do that.

18:44.809 --> 18:46.371
I want to hear about that.

18:47.112 --> 18:51.537
I've had, I mean, there have been friends of mine, academics particularly, who said,

18:52.023 --> 18:53.185
ESP.

18:53.205 --> 18:54.186
You can't be serious.

18:55.127 --> 19:06.543
And the truth is, it was sort of ballsy, pardon me, but I said, I believe in it, and I've read enough about it, but I believe this could happen.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.204
Impertinent?

19:07.224 --> 19:08.947
Can we put in that word instead of ballsy?

19:09.227 --> 19:09.928
Yeah.

19:09.968 --> 19:12.011
I can't use ballsy for my clients.

19:12.031 --> 19:12.932
Yeah, no, you can't.

19:14.515 --> 19:17.659
It's called risky, in a sense, all right?

19:18.382 --> 19:19.283
I do believe in it.

19:19.924 --> 19:40.995
And when I saw that the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, has psychics on their payroll, and they used them to find a general dozier in Italy when he was kidnapped by the Red Brigades, a number of cases which are all in there, I said, well, okay, maybe Cambridge doesn't believe in it.

19:42.698 --> 19:44.220
But I do believe.

19:44.453 --> 19:49.659
And the Defense Department does, and the Russian KGB, and the East Germans do.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.022
There are some people who have this ability.

19:52.443 --> 20:03.456
And I talked to a couple of friends of mine who are neurologists and neurobiologists, and I said, if it's possible that we can hear other people's thoughts in any way, where would this be?

20:03.476 --> 20:13.228
And they told me there's a speech center in the brain, which is basically where thoughts are downloaded before we speak.

20:13.681 --> 20:15.003
We're about to form words.

20:15.604 --> 20:16.685
Yeah.

20:16.705 --> 20:23.175
And then, you know, by the way, there was a front page story in the Globe a few months ago, right after I'd finished writing the book.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.298
It really is risky for a fiction writer.

20:25.318 --> 20:25.498
Yeah.

20:25.918 --> 20:26.419
Oh, yeah.

20:26.439 --> 20:27.160
I'm trying to interrupt.

20:27.180 --> 20:27.280
Yeah.

20:27.621 --> 20:28.863
There's a front page story in the Globe.

20:31.246 --> 20:33.850
Cornell researcher finds evidence for an ESP.

20:34.330 --> 20:41.240
Well, you know, okay, people buy Anne Rice and they believe in witches and vampires.

20:41.360 --> 20:41.661
Okay.

20:41.681 --> 20:41.781
Okay.

20:42.672 --> 20:44.594
This is something that I really think is plausible.

20:45.295 --> 20:49.740
And in any case, I thought this would be very entertaining.

20:50.841 --> 20:59.211
And as long as I have as much underpinning of fact around it, there'll be the suspension of disbelief.

20:59.231 --> 21:04.717
You know, Jurassic Park comes out of actual DNA fossil research.

21:04.858 --> 21:07.120
You know, that is what emboldened me, I have to say.

21:07.140 --> 21:11.245
When I read Jurassic Park, I said, you know, dinosaurs do not live

21:11.630 --> 21:14.413
And so far, we cannot clone them.

21:15.293 --> 21:18.236
But it is a possibility.

21:18.256 --> 21:21.239
And Crichton did all the up-to-date research and found out that it was brilliant.

21:21.259 --> 21:22.640
He was brilliant.

21:22.660 --> 21:29.667
And I said, I was so blown away by Jurassic Park, and I realized, I think that this is something that could happen in the near future as well.

21:29.867 --> 21:33.791
They did something not unlike it shortly thereafter.

21:33.891 --> 21:34.191
Right.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.754
Nothing as dramatic as a dinosaur, but they did.

21:36.774 --> 21:37.755
No, but they got the amber.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.877
Yeah, there was a clone of something.

21:39.897 --> 21:40.738
I mean, they did something.

21:40.778 --> 21:41.198
That's right.

21:42.005 --> 21:45.088
So it really was Jurassic Park, but that's what it was.

21:45.108 --> 21:46.149
All you need is that premise.

21:46.269 --> 21:47.811
That's the actual premise.

21:47.911 --> 21:48.392
Right.

21:48.412 --> 22:07.371
And again, it was risky, but I have to say, you know, I sort of, this is corny, but I clipped out a quotation from Herodotus that I put up ironically that said, what is it, great deeds are wrought at great risks.

22:07.925 --> 22:16.717
Now, understand, I meant this with irony, but nonetheless I thought, you know, if you're going to do something, if you're going to really go out on a limb, go out on a limb, you know?

22:17.258 --> 22:18.479
That's right.

22:18.499 --> 22:18.619
Right?

22:19.140 --> 22:23.726
So, and the other risk I took with this book is writing this in the first person.

22:24.568 --> 22:25.769
You do not do this in thrillers.

22:26.971 --> 22:27.992
Interesting.

22:28.012 --> 22:29.194
It's highly unusual.

22:29.795 --> 22:34.741
You know, I hadn't... If you look around, if you look at your shelf, whatever... It seems right to me.

22:34.942 --> 22:35.162
Yeah.

22:35.182 --> 22:35.282
Yeah.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.202
Why is that?

22:37.262 --> 22:41.626
Because very often the only character might be blown away, too.

22:41.846 --> 22:42.247
Yeah.

22:43.588 --> 22:45.030
Fundamentally, you lose a threat.

22:45.190 --> 22:48.673
You lose the feeling that the person— But you came up with a very interesting device.

22:48.693 --> 22:48.954
Yeah.

22:48.994 --> 22:49.654
Well, it's a frame.

22:49.714 --> 22:52.297
It's something that Michelle helped me with, actually.

22:52.958 --> 22:56.081
Michelle's specialty is 19th-century fiction.

22:56.922 --> 23:01.346
I mean, Margaret Atwood did the same thing with Handmaiden's Tale.

23:02.407 --> 23:04.189
They find the manuscript.

23:04.338 --> 23:04.678
Right.

23:05.019 --> 23:06.780
It's the old 19th century frame.

23:07.301 --> 23:21.655
And I use that framing device to say that this would sort of make it, in a sense, more involving and scarier to realize that what you are reading is an actual manuscript that has been, you know, sent by a dead man.

23:22.536 --> 23:26.120
And throughout the book you get me wondering how was he killed and why.

23:26.180 --> 23:31.425
And that, you know, that tweaked attention as far as I was concerned.

23:32.030 --> 23:34.133
But writing in the book, I loved the first person.

23:34.393 --> 23:34.894
I loved it.

23:35.395 --> 23:40.862
And there's riskiness to, it's kind of a downer at the beginning.

23:40.882 --> 23:45.489
And again, I abused the book, but you know, you get to like the character.

23:45.649 --> 23:46.971
And you don't want him to die.

23:46.991 --> 23:47.552
But he's dead.

23:47.612 --> 23:48.473
He doesn't want him to be dead.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.715
I don't want him to be dead.

23:49.895 --> 23:50.937
Maybe there's a trick here.

23:50.977 --> 23:52.579
Maybe he's not dead.

23:52.639 --> 23:53.140
Maybe there is.

23:53.160 --> 23:53.881
Maybe there isn't.

23:53.901 --> 23:54.862
Right.

23:55.723 --> 24:01.952
But my agent and my editor both were very nervous about first person.

24:02.270 --> 24:07.797
And they said, readers don't really buy first-person narratives.

24:07.897 --> 24:09.539
I couldn't disagree more.

24:09.719 --> 24:10.120
Me too.

24:10.900 --> 24:13.383
I think the first person is appealing as hell.

24:13.403 --> 24:19.050
I see some structural problems with it, because you really have to have it entirely from the point of view of the narrator.

24:19.170 --> 24:20.132
That's the major problem.

24:20.212 --> 24:21.674
You cannot get any third-person perspective.

24:21.694 --> 24:22.815
You can't go over there to get that.

24:22.835 --> 24:24.897
You don't see the bad guys in the bushes.

24:25.258 --> 24:25.738
You don't see that.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.262
But the immediacy, and this is the way it happens.

24:28.322 --> 24:28.682
Yeah.

24:28.932 --> 24:30.775
It's so enrapturing.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.561
It's not a word, but so appealing.

24:34.903 --> 24:36.185
I loved it.

24:36.306 --> 24:50.833
And also, the other sort of risk I think I took is not allowing myself to be straight-jacketed by the conventions of the genre.

24:50.853 --> 24:52.155
In other words, there are

24:52.709 --> 24:55.112
You know, there has to be a bad guy and a good guy.

24:55.192 --> 24:56.694
Certain things have to happen.

24:56.714 --> 24:59.558
No sense of humor, all that sort of thing, right?

24:59.578 --> 25:00.479
It'd be deadly earnest.

25:01.080 --> 25:09.612
Well, as you see, you know, my character, the narrative voice, makes jokes and witticisms.

25:10.693 --> 25:17.282
And perhaps he's a little too intellectual, you know, for a CIA agent.

25:17.971 --> 25:20.293
Well, yeah, but he's kind of a maverick, too.

25:20.313 --> 25:20.994
Yeah, he's a maverick.

25:21.014 --> 25:22.235
He left at a young age.

25:22.456 --> 25:24.318
Yeah, yeah.

25:24.338 --> 25:25.739
He had problems with it.

25:25.759 --> 25:28.001
Right, right.

25:29.343 --> 25:29.883
He's different.

25:30.224 --> 25:30.484
Right.

25:30.844 --> 25:37.271
And so, you know, there's stuff in there in Boston in which I sort of make fun of certain restaurants and that sort of thing, you know.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.874
On the Wall Street without any bars.

25:39.994 --> 25:40.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:41.015 --> 25:43.478
And there's stuff in there which I really enjoyed writing.

25:43.678 --> 25:45.760
And it sounds immodest.

25:46.381 --> 25:47.742
I know it'll sound immodest.

25:48.683 --> 25:52.426
I'd pick this book up, and I'll look through it, and I'll really take pleasure out of reading the passage.

25:53.487 --> 25:53.928
That's nice.

25:53.988 --> 25:57.551
Now, this is not literature, obviously.

25:57.951 --> 25:58.912
This is entertainment.

25:58.932 --> 26:05.098
This is like, you know, I hope this is as effective as, you know, No Way Out or, you know, a movie like that.

26:05.978 --> 26:08.401
But I really enjoyed writing it.

26:08.581 --> 26:09.381
Like a movie like that?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.703
I mean, is there a subtext to that?

26:11.723 --> 26:16.107
Do you have any sold options on this at all?

26:16.127 --> 26:16.868
This week...

26:19.210 --> 26:24.176
Yeah, we had several offers, and we were just about to sign a deal, make a deal.

26:25.758 --> 26:26.739
It's very exciting.

26:26.979 --> 26:30.744
But I'll tell you this off the record, because it's not a thing I'll say.

26:31.485 --> 26:40.456
But I can say on the record that we're on the verge of signing a movie deal, and it's a major star.

26:40.476 --> 26:43.399
You should get a deal as consultant to this thing, too.

26:43.439 --> 26:44.461
I'd like to, yeah.

26:44.501 --> 26:47.364
And I'd like to be involved.

26:47.424 --> 26:48.205
I don't want to be...

26:48.607 --> 26:52.932
I do believe that movies are a very different language from books.

26:53.553 --> 26:56.096
Well, they are, by definition, collaborative efforts.

26:56.196 --> 26:56.756
That's right.

26:57.818 --> 27:02.123
And, you know, you take someone like Tom Clancy, who... Take him, please.

27:02.183 --> 27:08.390
Yeah, who went out, you know, and started lambasting Patriot Games, which, number one, is better than the book.

27:09.732 --> 27:09.932
Oh, I see.

27:09.952 --> 27:10.072
Right?

27:10.092 --> 27:12.295
And number two was an excellent movie, I thought.

27:12.775 --> 27:15.238
Yeah, his writing has become maddening.

27:15.455 --> 27:17.158
Off the record, he's a shitty writer.

27:17.219 --> 27:17.780
No, it's okay.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.904
That's fine, but I will tell you.

27:20.505 --> 27:24.232
No, we're not.

27:24.453 --> 27:24.974
Oh, we are?

27:24.994 --> 27:26.236
Okay, sorry.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.782
Red light is on the way out.

27:29.263 --> 27:29.403
Yeah.

27:29.623 --> 27:35.194
No, he, at Random House, they never edited him at all.

27:35.214 --> 27:37.058
And he just moved to Bantam.

27:37.173 --> 27:39.055
You know, nobody edits Stephen King.

27:39.156 --> 27:39.937
They're scared.

27:39.957 --> 27:40.177
Right.

27:40.277 --> 27:42.340
Nobody edits Clancy.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.942
They're scared.

27:44.002 --> 27:46.305
I guess what they're thinking is it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

27:46.345 --> 27:48.968
People are going to buy the next Ludlam or Clancy or King.

27:49.069 --> 27:50.470
No, but these guys have egos.

27:50.550 --> 27:51.472
Tom Clancy.

27:51.492 --> 27:51.672
Right.

27:51.692 --> 27:55.897
Stephen King brought out his first novel in the unexpercated Ludlam.

27:55.917 --> 27:57.219
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:57.239 --> 27:57.580
Endless.

27:58.481 --> 27:59.302
I've never read any of that.

27:59.322 --> 28:05.830
Yeah, you're not going to see the unabridged Moscow Club or the unabridged Stuart Harry Powers.

28:05.890 --> 28:06.131
I love that.

28:06.151 --> 28:07.112
The editors...

28:07.312 --> 28:36.441
if you have a great editor it makes all the difference and you know i have i already have two editors before i've been given to my publishing house michelle and my brother henry two terrific editors you mentioned that here yeah i mean you know and my agent who actually is an editor i mean my agent's wife is a first have you read the book how we die you know the book i've heard about him i haven't read it it's labor intensive a really terrible thing well ethan says that glenn came to him first the idea

28:36.640 --> 28:41.646
I mean, I don't know.

28:41.726 --> 28:46.131
I don't know.

28:46.391 --> 28:53.700
Forget about writing about it.

28:55.702 --> 28:58.105
Go ahead.

28:59.226 --> 29:03.711
Don't worry.

29:03.944 --> 29:07.569
Yeah, and my brother had him.

29:08.870 --> 29:09.431
Let's see.

29:11.574 --> 29:11.894
What else?

29:11.914 --> 29:12.855
We talked about the gold.

29:12.895 --> 29:16.480
We talked about the ESP.

29:18.662 --> 29:20.705
You did tell me about the ESP.

29:20.745 --> 29:22.607
Let me ask you a question.

29:22.667 --> 29:24.550
Do you know Walter Forteimer?

29:24.570 --> 29:25.531
Is that his library?

29:27.393 --> 29:28.855
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

29:29.881 --> 29:33.304
You know, I mean, Edmund Moore's library that you have?

29:33.324 --> 29:36.127
Or is that just something you... It's based on Walter Ford Simon.

29:36.147 --> 29:37.108
Because he's in my book.

29:37.769 --> 29:37.989
Yeah.

29:38.009 --> 29:40.151
I went to his house at the Watergate.

29:40.412 --> 29:40.732
Yeah.

29:41.353 --> 29:43.575
And the collection is very similar to his.

29:44.996 --> 29:46.017
But I'd heard about that.

29:46.057 --> 29:49.881
So yeah, he's sort of based on the concept of Ford Simon.

29:49.901 --> 29:51.242
Yeah, and that's not a question.

29:51.262 --> 29:55.787
Yeah, and there are characters in my book, no question, who are based on...

29:56.020 --> 30:17.640
cia officials i know retired cia officials i know in particular absolutely you you do mention using your it isn't often in a work of fiction that you that you acknowledge the uh the help of you know professional intelligence people yeah and you do maintain this network of context

30:18.093 --> 30:20.756
Oh, it's very important.

30:20.816 --> 30:27.204
It's very important for plausibility and for when I want to do research, you know, and I do a lot of research.

30:29.227 --> 30:35.956
And also just in terms of the gestalt, you know, I need to know what they're feeling.

30:36.937 --> 30:44.286
That's why I'm portraying a CIA in this book post-Cold War, where there's sort of a scared...

30:44.857 --> 30:46.939
anxious feeling, now what?

30:46.999 --> 30:47.500
What do we do?

30:47.540 --> 30:48.420
What's the purpose?

30:48.440 --> 30:49.782
What's the mission of the CIA?

30:50.342 --> 30:54.066
And I was hearing this sort of angst from a number of CIA people I talked to.

30:54.206 --> 31:04.556
I remember when you and I sat, and I think we even did that interview here, and you were actually predicting the demise of the Soviet Union.

31:04.676 --> 31:06.978
So this was no fluke in the last book, wasn't it?

31:07.659 --> 31:11.202
You saw something there that...

31:11.587 --> 31:12.728
it's not clairvoyance.

31:12.788 --> 31:30.569
It really is, you know, if you study this stuff closely, this is, you know, this is the advantage to actually having a nonfiction expertise, where instead of, I think a lot of thriller writers pick up their ideas from the headlines and just run with it.

31:31.009 --> 31:39.659
But in fact, if you have access to intelligent sources and you sort of have your ear to the ground, you do hear things.

31:40.120 --> 31:40.480
And

31:40.679 --> 31:48.807
I heard about this gold before it was in the press.

31:48.847 --> 31:53.472
I heard about the Ames case almost a year ago.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.254
So they've been working on it for quite a while.

31:55.274 --> 31:56.796
They've been working on it for about two years.

31:56.816 --> 31:57.957
You heard Ames didn't hear about it?

31:57.977 --> 31:59.438
You heard about Ames didn't hear about it?

31:59.458 --> 32:00.740
Well, I didn't have a name.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.061
I didn't have a position.

32:03.623 --> 32:05.504
Bad trade craft.

32:06.065 --> 32:08.948
And the book I'm working on now, which

32:09.535 --> 32:11.718
sort of centers on an event that will happen.

32:11.758 --> 32:17.164
All this stuff you get from maintaining the sources.

32:17.184 --> 32:26.255
And there is a sort of trade-off, because you cannot abuse CIA if you want to maintain relations.

32:27.116 --> 32:29.799
Give me a current quote on Ames.

32:30.961 --> 32:32.102
I mean, what do your people tell you?

32:32.142 --> 32:34.445
I mean, is it as bad as they say?

32:34.986 --> 32:36.167
Well, first of all, there is...

32:36.687 --> 32:41.693
I heard this several months ago that there are two highly placed moles.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.656
This isn't the end of it.

32:44.676 --> 32:45.517
This is not the end.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.782
Because they've been looking for the moles since Angleton.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.224
Yeah, but you know, Angleton died in 75.

32:51.684 --> 32:56.470
Excuse me, was fired in 75.

32:56.850 --> 33:00.955
And it wasn't until 85 that Ames started to work.

33:00.975 --> 33:05.901
So Angleton really was...

33:06.337 --> 33:07.298
Semi-runatic.

33:07.418 --> 33:08.519
Hunting phantoms, right?

33:08.659 --> 33:09.540
I think so, yeah.

33:10.221 --> 33:13.905
And he sabotaged the CIA in many ways.

33:14.445 --> 33:21.392
And in fact, it really is a reaction to Angleton that made the CIA so lax.

33:21.833 --> 33:27.138
The Angleton era was like their McCarthyism.

33:27.979 --> 33:33.805
And there's such a fear of going back to that paralyzing era.

33:33.825 --> 33:36.107
Yeah, this guy slipped through the cracks.

33:36.307 --> 33:39.791
The Office of Security at the CIA is inept.

33:40.372 --> 33:43.855
Their polygraph examiners only do it occasionally.

33:44.877 --> 33:46.679
He passed the test, apparently.

33:46.699 --> 33:49.121
He was boxed, as they call it in the agency, twice.

33:50.022 --> 33:51.404
And he passed the test.

33:51.664 --> 33:54.668
But if you know how to beat the test, there are ways to do it.

33:55.328 --> 34:01.856
And if you're examined by someone who's not a good examiner, it doesn't make any difference.

34:01.896 --> 34:03.057
It's easy to pass it.

34:03.222 --> 34:27.728
and plus he was an old boy and they probably his name was aldrich ames like somebody said his last name is right reversible right right i can't believe this um so that's you know we have a fascination for this stuff yeah yeah and the other thing is the fbi and the cia did not work together until recently yeah there's such rivalry that if they'd cross-checked

34:28.501 --> 34:30.123
their own reports.

34:30.764 --> 34:35.251
I was trying to read a book yesterday, lately, not yesterday, but recently, from Holt.

34:35.351 --> 34:36.793
I couldn't finish it.

34:36.853 --> 34:37.794
You know what I mean?

34:39.176 --> 34:40.618
Last Train from Germany or something.

34:40.638 --> 34:41.419
Oh, Noah Highland.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.341
Do you know the book?

34:42.861 --> 34:43.903
Oh, is it Tyler?

34:43.923 --> 34:44.724
Tyler.

34:44.744 --> 34:45.345
Yeah, W.T.

34:45.365 --> 34:45.966
Tyler.

34:45.986 --> 34:46.667
Couldn't finish it.

34:47.007 --> 34:49.451
What's it about?

34:49.511 --> 34:50.612
Again, it's a post.

34:50.672 --> 34:51.113
It's a guy.

34:51.133 --> 34:53.356
If the CIA leaves, they can't find him.

34:53.376 --> 34:55.860
And it would be perfect for him.

34:56.501 --> 34:57.462
But it's just...

34:57.998 --> 34:58.659
It doesn't grab you.

34:59.119 --> 34:59.920
It doesn't grab me.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.382
My wife could figure me, what are you doing with this book?

35:02.402 --> 35:05.445
I said, I'm going to give it one more day.

35:05.465 --> 35:07.427
You know, if you can't do it, you can't do it.

35:07.447 --> 35:08.508
All of a sudden, you're right.

35:08.548 --> 35:10.290
This is what I've never understood.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.272
Why do people write entertainment that is not entertaining?

35:13.913 --> 35:14.894
It has to entertain you.

35:14.914 --> 35:16.175
Absolutely.

35:16.195 --> 35:20.499
Now, do you surprise yourself where you're going, or are you pretty fairly well-plotted?

35:21.760 --> 35:24.763
I don't believe in letting the story get out of control.

35:25.664 --> 35:27.786
There are writers who say,

35:28.289 --> 35:30.232
Wherever the muse takes me, that's where I'm going.

35:30.672 --> 35:33.436
But I believe in knowing the last scene.

35:33.456 --> 35:35.999
I always know the last scene.

35:36.019 --> 35:41.246
And the last scene of this book, I really loved writing.

35:41.346 --> 35:42.307
You'll see, it's very exciting.

35:42.568 --> 35:44.730
I'll probably finish it tonight or tomorrow.

35:45.932 --> 35:46.953
I have to know where it's ending.

35:47.134 --> 35:48.836
I don't always know how it's going to get there.

35:49.757 --> 35:50.378
But that's fun.

35:50.698 --> 35:58.228
That's what's fun, because it's too... I have tried to write things that are too rigidly outlined and plotted out, and it's no fun.

35:58.580 --> 35:59.781
You sort of feel like a machine.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.343
So I'll have notes.

36:01.383 --> 36:05.909
I'll say, in this chapter, Ben goes to see Edmund Moore.

36:06.529 --> 36:14.458
I'll say, you know, talk about the libraries and the CIA old boy, and he learns X. And then the scene is mine to create.

36:15.520 --> 36:15.900
You know?

36:15.920 --> 36:24.230
Ford Zimmer, by the way, claimed in this interview with me that the six days of Bacondo, which was based on his character, based on him.

36:25.211 --> 36:25.451
Interesting.

36:25.471 --> 36:26.513
You have a guy who reads.

36:26.533 --> 36:26.933
Yeah.

36:27.048 --> 36:55.705
he was the cia like he was the curator he built a library over there and he built his own library yeah and uh i bet if you asked him at the time when you know when the book of the movie came out he denied anything interesting house dog he had something about that yeah it's it's clear that germany is is the major power is going to become you know there as a unit as their problems of unification worked out uh a a major

36:56.039 --> 37:00.245
political forces, and that there really is going to be some realignment in Europe.

37:00.846 --> 37:01.668
Russia is weak.

37:01.988 --> 37:02.990
Germany is strong.

37:04.752 --> 37:08.558
There is an absolute resurgence in neo-Nazism.

37:08.899 --> 37:13.245
But you also predict a major depression, a recession in Germany.

37:13.265 --> 37:13.486
Yes.

37:14.066 --> 37:14.287
Yes.

37:14.387 --> 37:21.177
Which would lead... Is there something that you divide, or is there something that's just here for dramatic purposes?

37:21.197 --> 37:24.342
I sort of think it's possible that

37:25.081 --> 37:28.625
I mean, the weight of the East.

37:28.685 --> 37:29.005
Yes.

37:29.386 --> 37:43.621
Can well collapse, and when it does collapse, it's at that point that all the dissatisfaction finds the expression in the form of neo-Nazism and sort of this statism.

37:44.001 --> 37:45.743
The weight is in Russia, too, for example.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.746
I'll predict right now Yeltsin will be out within two years.

37:48.946 --> 37:49.667
I really think so.

37:50.488 --> 37:52.270
Replaced by what kind of a prison?

37:52.435 --> 38:04.008
not necessarily Geronofsky, but maybe with Skoy, or maybe one of these quote-unquote right-wing neo-fascists.

38:04.028 --> 38:07.131
And that is the right-wing in Russia.

38:07.192 --> 38:12.217
We used to think that the reactionaries are communists, are hard-line communists.

38:12.938 --> 38:13.479
That's not so?

38:13.999 --> 38:18.124
It doesn't make any sense to apply that to Russia, really.

38:18.164 --> 38:21.868
But based on our notion of fascism,

38:22.287 --> 38:23.328
versus communism.

38:23.368 --> 38:26.051
Now the left is the left and the right is the left.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.292
It's very confusing.

38:27.452 --> 38:39.505
But basically I think that we're going to see a strongly nationalistic drive for great power to restore the greatness of Russia.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.807
And they really don't have a democratic tradition.

38:42.608 --> 38:42.908
They don't.

38:43.709 --> 38:47.012
And the majority do not want democracy.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.114
They've never had it.

38:48.254 --> 38:48.514
Right.

38:49.085 --> 38:50.287
It's not in their blood, everything.

38:50.307 --> 38:50.567
Yeah.

38:50.647 --> 38:53.271
I don't know why we assume that democracy is the only way to go.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.594
It didn't work in Africa for the most part.

38:56.135 --> 38:56.355
Yeah, yeah.

38:56.375 --> 39:00.561
You know, we all try to set up these little Americas with these constitutions everywhere we go.

39:00.621 --> 39:02.504
It doesn't work, does it?

39:03.004 --> 39:03.605
It doesn't work, does it?

39:03.625 --> 39:03.685
No.

39:03.745 --> 39:04.446
Look in Japan.

39:04.486 --> 39:04.867
Right.

39:04.947 --> 39:12.357
If you look at Korea or Taiwan or a number of countries, you're not going to see standard democracy.

39:12.377 --> 39:12.898
No.

39:13.385 --> 39:16.028
It's still very much in a great state of flux.

39:16.048 --> 39:16.368
Oh, yeah.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.290
I mean, Russia's a mess.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.913
But you don't want to get into the prediction business, either.

39:21.973 --> 39:23.455
I just did.

39:24.716 --> 39:27.619
Well, you did, I guess, actually.

39:28.079 --> 39:30.742
Why don't you restate your prediction, then?

39:32.403 --> 39:40.191
I predict that within two years Yeltsin will be out and his government will be replaced legally.

39:41.091 --> 39:41.772
I mean, you know,

39:41.988 --> 39:43.971
Judicially, legislatively.

39:44.952 --> 39:45.934
Same way Hitler took over.

39:46.094 --> 39:46.294
Right.

39:49.158 --> 40:08.687
By a dictatorial oligarchy or straight-on dictator who will rally the people around the restoration of Russia as a great power, Russia versus its surrounding former republics.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.643
as a threat, the U.S.

40:10.663 --> 40:13.007
as a threat, NATO as a threat, et cetera.

40:13.507 --> 40:20.238
This idea of the outside world being a threat to us is very powerful in terms of obtaining cohesion.

40:20.318 --> 40:25.846
And what kind of consequences do you see for the rest of us?

40:25.926 --> 40:31.214
I mean, do you see a return to the fear and the... Oh, well, yeah.

40:31.935 --> 40:37.524
At this point... Well, you know, the Russian army is totally enfeebled now.

40:38.024 --> 40:38.505
It's ridiculous.

40:39.194 --> 40:43.421
We couldn't make it to Kiev, right?

40:44.943 --> 40:49.370
But the fact is that Russia still has a vast nuclear arsenal.

40:49.991 --> 40:54.479
And you can be a minor state in Africa.

40:54.539 --> 40:58.305
If you have that kind of nuclear arsenal, you become a world force.

40:58.645 --> 41:02.652
And they have a formidable delivery system on top of it.

41:02.672 --> 41:03.413
Yes, they do.

41:04.085 --> 41:24.311
So I think that we will see another version of a Cold War, quite likely, based on not ideology, not communism versus capitalism, but based on the war of two great states warring for dominance.

41:24.331 --> 41:25.553
This is entirely possible.

41:25.870 --> 41:29.755
In any case, within Europe, Russia is struggling to establish pressure.

41:29.775 --> 41:31.777
But how about those former East Blocs?

41:31.797 --> 41:36.142
I mean, Poland is supposed to be doing okay.

41:36.162 --> 41:39.126
Some of these countries kind of coming into the community.

41:39.206 --> 41:39.747
Yeah.

41:39.807 --> 41:51.961
It'll depend really on how successful these countries are in terms of re-emerging as democratic or socialist democratic states.

41:52.382 --> 41:52.722
And...

41:53.140 --> 42:00.489
You know, you see already in what used to be Yugoslavia that if it doesn't happen, there's all this internal strife that can explode.

42:01.410 --> 42:03.353
Chaos.

42:04.314 --> 42:05.235
Yeah.

42:05.255 --> 42:14.146
So when people, you know, have said to me, now that the Cold War is over, what do thriller writers write about?

42:14.467 --> 42:14.927
Oh, really?

42:15.688 --> 42:19.814
And, you know, Le Carré answered that with The Night Manager.

42:20.434 --> 42:22.557
My next book has to do with terrorism.

42:22.823 --> 42:24.284
Martin Cruz Smith tried it.

42:24.585 --> 42:26.106
Yeah, yeah.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.027
He read it, actually.

42:27.227 --> 42:27.708
I didn't read it.

42:27.988 --> 42:29.189
I'm going to.

42:29.409 --> 42:30.130
He's terrific.

42:30.250 --> 42:30.951
One of Joe Fox.

42:31.051 --> 42:31.852
Yeah, another great Joe Fox.

42:31.872 --> 42:35.635
Well, that's really one of his triumphs, actually.

42:35.695 --> 42:35.955
Yeah, yeah.

42:35.975 --> 42:37.497
You know, Gorky Park was one of his periods.

42:37.877 --> 42:38.137
Right.

42:38.157 --> 42:39.919
Well, Gorky Park's amazing.

42:41.240 --> 42:44.443
But, I'm sorry, what was it?

42:44.463 --> 42:49.328
You were talking about such than a thriller writer.

42:49.508 --> 42:51.430
Oh, yeah, well, yeah, what I'm saying is that

42:51.764 --> 42:56.090
is that the thriller did not emerge from the Cold War.

42:56.170 --> 43:00.596
The thriller was born really in the late 19th century, beginning of the century.

43:00.616 --> 43:04.000
It really had to do with... The spy novel is a subgenre.

43:04.281 --> 43:04.481
Yes.

43:05.062 --> 43:05.262
Yes.

43:05.342 --> 43:08.426
And that was born probably with the informing, I would say, no?

43:08.446 --> 43:09.248
Or maybe earlier?

43:09.548 --> 43:12.672
I would argue that it was born earlier.

43:13.633 --> 43:19.101
I did a piece, which I could send you if you want, for the TLS about the spy novel, The Fate of the Thriller.

43:19.121 --> 43:20.202
You might be interested in it.

43:20.222 --> 43:20.963
I would, actually.

43:21.164 --> 43:21.484
But...

43:22.207 --> 43:45.430
uh you know it was it was born in really edwardian england and their fear of the germans and their feel fear of infiltration and you know don't forget that uh graham green and eric amber some of the great ones wrote before world war ii yeah so um we just think of this as a spy novel as being a cold war phenomenon and it's just not

43:45.545 --> 43:51.813
Whenever there is a geopolitical threat in the world... What was the Maltese Falcon?

43:51.834 --> 43:52.795
Yeah.

43:52.815 --> 43:54.777
Well, that's a mystery, I suppose.

43:55.719 --> 43:55.939
Yeah.

43:56.320 --> 44:04.491
But whenever there's a geopolitical threat in the world, there will always be a hunger for the international thriller.

44:05.131 --> 44:12.261
And that's why I believe that we're not seeing the end of... We're not seeing a world that's become safe and happy.

44:12.281 --> 44:14.404
We're seeing a world that's more tumultuous.

44:14.789 --> 44:16.214
I'm going to ask you to sign this for me.

44:16.255 --> 44:16.355
What?

44:16.395 --> 44:18.001
You got a nice pen?

44:18.443 --> 44:19.005
I got it, Claire.

44:19.125 --> 44:21.414
Oh, good.

44:21.434 --> 44:23.321
I think we've got a pretty thorough thing here.

44:23.341 --> 44:23.683
Oh, yeah.

44:23.703 --> 44:23.884
Oh, yeah.

44:23.904 --> 44:24.365
We've got a lot.

44:24.426 --> 44:25.289
And I can call you.

44:25.309 --> 44:26.132
Yeah.
