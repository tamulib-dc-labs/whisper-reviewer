01:28.223 --> 01:34.433
Bye.

02:40.192 --> 02:46.221
Now check this out, one day back in the belly, four guys wanted to sing.

02:46.241 --> 02:47.863
They came up to me, I said, but what's your name?

02:47.883 --> 02:48.204
What's the name?

02:48.224 --> 02:50.047
Hey, you know what I'm saying?

02:50.067 --> 02:52.230
And then I said, all right, fellas, let me see what you can do.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.775
And then a smile one day whining and said, yo, Mike, check this out.

02:55.795 --> 02:57.137
See if this one moves you.

03:39.743 --> 04:02.725
Boy, it's the man, ABC, baby.

Hey, you're all my love.

04:04.667 --> 04:05.628
Cause that's all right.

04:05.668 --> 04:09.632
Girl, it won't be there for you.

04:16.109 --> 04:31.294
Ain't got no time for part-time loving in my mind But you want to be loved, huh?

04:31.594 --> 04:43.213
Hey, that's okay If I fall in line right with my sexuality But you gotta be real And you gotta be true Cause I don't know why this thing ain't got no time for you

04:59.731 --> 05:02.034

05:02.054 --> 05:06.940
.

05:07.000 --> 05:20.777

05:33.464 --> 05:36.167
and back to the field.

06:02.388 --> 06:12.644
Bye.

06:13.366 --> 06:18.574
Bye.

06:31.210 --> 06:36.238
Informer, you know the enemy told me I have a blame.

06:36.398 --> 06:37.780
I like the bomb bomb now.

06:37.820 --> 06:44.311
Take the money to see the enemy told me I have a blame.

These are them alone for me, now they blow down me door.

06:53.005 --> 06:54.949
Bring me the car through, through my window.

06:54.969 --> 06:57.433
So they put me in there, but they call at the station.

06:57.453 --> 06:59.697
From that point, I'm gonna reach my destination.

06:59.717 --> 07:02.021
When the destination is, you're not a easy tension.

07:02.041 --> 07:05.788
We're the loot on the pants, look up me, but I'm so informant.

07:05.808 --> 07:07.992
You know, they don't miss me, they have a blame.

07:08.012 --> 07:08.813
I like it boom, boom, damn.

07:08.833 --> 07:12.540
Take them on the street, they don't miss me, they don't miss me, they stop somewhere down there.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.144
Every way me go, me never left for a tolling.

08:50.324 --> 08:52.909
You say that it's no me, you're the ram dance man.

08:52.970 --> 08:55.334

09:28.668 --> 09:32.076
Kiss what?

09:36.427 --> 09:46.491
No.

10:06.383 --> 10:14.923
It doesn't mean that I'm not standing up.

10:14.943 --> 10:15.765
No, no, no.

10:15.785 --> 10:16.827
Oh, my, forgive me for heavy strength.

Thank you.

18:41.645 --> 18:48.668
We'll be right back.

19:57.143 --> 20:01.062
Why does it have to be so good?

20:36.985 --> 20:39.308
It should be those who think it's dirty.

20:39.389 --> 20:39.829
Have a choice.

20:39.889 --> 20:42.273
Pick up a needle, breath, pause, or turn the radio off.

20:42.353 --> 20:43.575
Will that stop us, Ben?

20:43.595 --> 20:44.236
I doubt it.

20:44.256 --> 20:44.816
All right, then.

20:44.836 --> 20:45.658
Come on, spin.

Let's talk about sex, baby.

20:47.901 --> 20:49.844
Let's talk about you and me.

20:50.064 --> 20:54.350
Let's talk about all of the things and the bad things that make me.

20:54.370 --> 20:55.893
Let's talk about sex.

20:56.534 --> 20:57.535
Let's talk about sex.

20:57.555 --> 20:58.657
A little bit, a little bit.

20:58.737 --> 21:00.860
Let's talk about sex.

21:00.880 --> 21:01.681
Let's talk about sex.

21:01.701 --> 21:04.385
Let's talk about sex.

21:04.405 --> 21:04.766
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

21:04.786 --> 21:05.647
Try to make any man vibe.

21:05.667 --> 21:06.368
Pops, use the street.

21:17.553 --> 21:44.640
They men of taste, lawyers, doctors No one was too great for her to get wit or even mess with The press, she says, was next on her list And, believe me, you, it's as good as true There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to She had it all in the bag So she should've been glad But she was mad and sad and feeling bad Thinking about the things that she never had No love, just that, followed the answers with the check and the notes That last night was dope, dope, dope, dope

21:45.278 --> 21:49.146
Let's follow up 620 Let's follow up

22:02.069 --> 22:19.723
Ladies, all the ladies Louder now, help me out Come on, all the ladies All right, ladies, all the ladies Louder now, help me out Come on, all the ladies

22:52.930 --> 22:57.085
Let's talk about that.

23:21.871 --> 23:41.989
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner, sometimes I feel like my only friend is the city I live in, the city of angels, lonely as I am.

23:50.643 --> 23:58.576
I drive on the streets, cause she's my companion.

23:58.596 --> 24:04.586
I walk through with her, cause she knows who I am.

24:04.606 --> 24:07.731
She sees my good dancing, she kisses you Wendy.

24:07.751 --> 24:11.858
And I never worry, now that is a lie.

24:21.845 --> 24:28.259
Like I did that day, take me to the place I love.

24:28.279 --> 24:33.690
Take me all the way that I don't ever want to be.

24:33.710 --> 24:38.841
Like I did that day, take me to the place I love.

24:52.287 --> 25:21.332
There's nobody out there It's hard to believe That I'm all alone At least I have her love To see that she loves me Lonely as I am Together we cry I don't ever wanna be

25:23.590 --> 25:39.861
Take me away

26:10.621 --> 26:17.813
I could not get enough Oh, God, I'm not my love

26:43.612 --> 27:03.021
Thank you.
