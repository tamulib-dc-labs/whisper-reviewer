WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:30.763
I'm the curator for the acquisitions and cataloging at the Herzog August Bibliothek at Walschenbüttel Duke August Library at Walschenbüttel and I'm also since about 20 years the secretary for the library history group at Walschenbüttel and it's my task to prepare the meeting

00:30.997 --> 00:36.906
the conferences of this working group, which is working internationally.

00:36.926 --> 00:52.368
We make our meetings together with the library history group of Great Britain and London, or with other groups, or with other institutions, and therefore I have to do a lot with old printed books as well.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.471
You're exactly the kind of person I should be talking to.

00:54.732 --> 00:59.839
When you talk about library history, are you talking about just in terms of the history of libraries

01:00.207 --> 01:01.789
as institutions?

01:03.312 --> 01:07.879
Maybe you could tell me a little bit about how you define library history and how you approach it.

01:08.279 --> 01:14.208
Yes, I think library history is no longer the history of the single institutions.

01:14.669 --> 01:21.940
This is a very old form, perhaps an anachronistic form of library history.

01:21.960 --> 01:27.008
Library history is a very interdisciplinary method

01:27.443 --> 01:35.775
has to deal with the history of knowledge, I think, especially the history of knowledge, the history of humanism, the history of science.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.318
I think it's a focus.

01:38.499 --> 01:50.095
It's a focus of most of our business disciplines dealing with humanist conditions and so on.

01:50.796 --> 01:54.902
And I think, too, the library history doesn't see

01:55.456 --> 01:58.920
this aim for its own dealing.

01:58.940 --> 02:05.609
In some years it will no longer be of any interest.

02:05.769 --> 02:07.071
Do you think so?

02:07.091 --> 02:07.732
I don't think so.

02:07.812 --> 02:12.277
It's no longer the history of the single institutions.

02:12.297 --> 02:19.166
I think it's perhaps too old a theme for dealing with.

02:19.186 --> 02:20.528
Why do you think it will no longer?

02:20.548 --> 02:25.294
What are the forces that are causing that to happen, do you think?

02:25.898 --> 02:27.140
Is it electronic?

02:27.160 --> 02:28.802
I mean, is it the movement away from books?

02:28.982 --> 02:35.091
No, I think it's also dealing with the databases and so on.

02:35.652 --> 02:49.191
But I think library history, only dealing with the library and that, this no longer seems interesting, a lot of people.

02:50.012 --> 02:53.998
Therefore, I think this discipline must

02:54.198 --> 03:03.889
together with other disciplines, like history, like philosophy, history of knowledge, as I said.

03:04.890 --> 03:11.658
Now you have people like Robert Darnton and Anne Chatier, they study the history of the book.

03:12.318 --> 03:15.882
Is this similar to the history of libraries?

03:15.902 --> 03:18.165
Are we talking about the same thing, or are we talking about different things here?

03:19.206 --> 03:23.631
In Germany, always the history of books,

03:23.864 --> 03:26.888
and history of the libraries were different things.

03:27.569 --> 03:39.705
But in France, Chartier, or in the US, Robert Danton, both disciplines were always turned together as one thing.

03:39.725 --> 03:48.156
And Robert Danton, Roger Chartier, and the others, I think they are dealing with the history of reading, history of learning.

03:48.177 --> 03:52.302
And this is what I think must also deal with.

03:55.268 --> 04:07.248
I'm interviewing Darton next month at Frankston, and I've already done a nice wonderful interview with Tony Grafton as well, and Father Boyle I interviewed at the Vatican Library.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.574
People with different takes.

04:12.357 --> 04:16.103
I'm really interested, but you distinguish between the library and the book, right?

04:16.123 --> 04:21.512
The library is an institution, I gather, in your view.

04:21.880 --> 04:28.967
The library is an institution, and in Germany there are very different minds about libraries.

04:29.848 --> 04:36.314
A lot of the university libraries are in no way dealing with their own history.

04:36.334 --> 04:43.481
They're only dealing, they're only interested in the work of the day.

04:43.962 --> 04:46.024
They're not looking back and so on.

04:46.064 --> 04:50.368
We have no time for looking back and no chance.

04:50.939 --> 04:57.467
The libraries with stockings of old printed books, they are dealing also with history.

04:57.987 --> 05:12.524
There's not a lot of libraries in Germany, only I think perhaps ten, which have a great lot of old printed books, and who are dealing with themes like book history and library history.

05:13.145 --> 05:19.292
This is the libraries at Walsham-Buttel, at Göttingen, at Leimann,

05:19.947 --> 05:23.432
and other ones, but it's not worth a great deal.

05:23.572 --> 05:30.861
And of course, your library is quite an extraordinary library in that it began as a private collection, isn't that right?

05:30.881 --> 05:35.427
It began as a collection of the Dukes of Franzi Wolfenbüttel.

05:36.468 --> 05:45.280
And the name of Duke August is the name of the greatest collector, but August was not the first founder.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.604
He was one of his predecessors in the

05:48.989 --> 05:51.132
second half of the sixteenth century.

05:51.152 --> 06:03.028
August was a re-founder in the midst of the first half of the seventeenth century, but his library is the focus of our work.

06:03.048 --> 06:07.454
It was a very, very great collection in the seventeenth century.

06:07.494 --> 06:16.667
When August died in 1666 he had collected perhaps one hundred thirty-five thousand

06:17.018 --> 06:20.382
That's an amazing number for that period of time.

06:20.402 --> 06:23.485
I can't think of any other comparable collections at that point.

06:23.825 --> 06:32.174
His library was, at this time, one of the greatest collections of northern Europe, I think.

06:32.194 --> 06:37.900
And he had built up this library not as a private library.

06:37.920 --> 06:42.925
It was a political institution for his country.

06:43.782 --> 06:45.524
That's how he conceived it?

06:45.544 --> 06:46.846
Oh, yes.

06:47.026 --> 06:59.703
He called his library as an immeasurable treasure for the whole country, which mustn't have gone over, which must take forever.

07:00.865 --> 07:09.216
And I think he knew that this was not a private thing, also because he had spent a lot of money for this.

07:09.685 --> 07:12.408
Was he a bibliomaniac?

07:12.428 --> 07:13.790
I mean, was he a bibliophile?

07:14.791 --> 07:24.543
Yes, I think he was too bibliophile, but at first rate he collected the books of his time.

07:25.765 --> 07:34.436
His time was the time of the Great War, the so-called Thirty-Year War, which has compended his whole life.

07:35.397 --> 07:38.781
And I think more than half of

07:38.896 --> 07:43.942
These 135,000 titles are titles from the 17th century.

07:44.182 --> 07:46.304
So they were largely printed books, obviously.

07:46.324 --> 07:47.726
Yes, printed books.

07:49.768 --> 07:52.632
The main discipline of the library was theology.

07:53.252 --> 07:54.814
It's not amazing.

07:54.854 --> 08:04.785
Theology was, still in the 17th century, the leading discipline of the thinking and so on.

08:04.805 --> 08:06.287
Theology, history,

08:07.077 --> 08:11.223
deuce, and philosophy, and so on.

08:12.084 --> 08:15.489
These are the main disciplines of Islamery.

08:15.949 --> 08:21.457
But I'd say once again, the 17th century is on time.

08:21.897 --> 08:24.140
This is the leading period.

08:24.161 --> 08:28.086
And he collected, and that is because he was also a bibliophile.

08:28.106 --> 08:32.913
He collected, naturally, the manuscripts of the early and the high medieval times.

08:33.073 --> 08:36.898
And he collected the manuscripts about all Europe, not only from

08:37.132 --> 08:48.567
and so on in Germany, what he collected, especially in France, Italy, yes, France, Italy, and Germany, I think, the main countries.

08:48.587 --> 08:51.531
He got his very, very wonderful manuscripts.

08:51.551 --> 08:54.875
And did he separate the manuscripts from the printed books?

08:55.055 --> 08:55.516
Yes.

08:55.536 --> 08:55.676
He did.

08:56.037 --> 09:04.928
He had the systematization, the classification, 20 groups, and one of these 20 groups was the manuscripts, the Augusteer,

09:05.262 --> 09:14.510
One of the things that amazed me up on Mount Athos in Greece was that they bought a lot of printed books, too, as they were issued.

09:14.731 --> 09:16.152
Incunubals, in fact.

09:16.172 --> 09:17.993
But they would mix them up with the manuscripts.

09:18.013 --> 09:20.296
They would even sometimes put them in the same binding.

09:21.296 --> 09:28.803
They really didn't distinguish between, you know, what was a unique work, a work in manuscript and a printed book.

09:28.823 --> 09:30.084
It was mainly the information.

09:30.385 --> 09:35.269
Now, was he collecting for rarity or was he collecting really for knowledge, do you think, in your view?

09:36.025 --> 09:38.428
I think he was especially collected for knowledge.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.335
He was very interested in theology.

09:43.875 --> 09:48.501
He studied jurisprudence, like all princes in Europe.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.585
But he was very interested in theology, in history.

09:53.087 --> 09:59.656
He has written by himself a book about chess-playing, chess-spiel, a very wonderful book.

09:59.676 --> 10:01.358
You can see it on the exhibition.

10:02.165 --> 10:20.362
And he discussed with the professors of his university at Helmstedt, a small town, I think 30 kilometer eastern of Wolfenbüttel, that was the university of the duchy of Brunswick, Lüneburg, and so on.

10:20.602 --> 10:26.327
And this university played a great part in the discussion of Aristotelism in the 17th century.

10:26.367 --> 10:31.632
And he took part in this discussion at a very high level.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.322
Was he a scholar in his own right?

10:34.563 --> 10:37.066
Yes, he was a very, very highly educated scholar.

10:37.967 --> 10:47.160
He couldn't only write and speak Latin, he also could read and translate Greek.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.361
That's amazing.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.506
This was not the usual thing.

10:51.666 --> 10:58.395
And do you think it was always in the forefront of his mind that this was something he was building for Germany, not for himself?

10:58.578 --> 11:01.221
It's the most important part for his country, you must see.

11:01.442 --> 11:05.227
Not Germany, I would say, Germany... His country, whatever.

11:05.267 --> 11:08.831
...a lot of small, small... Like Italy in some respects.

11:08.851 --> 11:12.196
...countries, but it was a political institution for his country.

11:12.676 --> 11:17.242
It was Dutchie, Brunswick, Los Angeles, part of the greater Dutchie of Brunswick, UNIROG.

11:17.903 --> 11:23.350
Do you think that this was a library in a political sense, the way the Ambrosiana is in Milan?

11:24.291 --> 11:27.015
It was a library for supporting

11:27.485 --> 11:31.932
his own ideas about theology, about history and so on.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.337
He was a very peaceful prince.

11:36.118 --> 11:53.745
I said that the great war, the 30th year war, was a part of his life and he has always tried to make peace with all other parts to make his own country rebuild, which was very hard destroyed by the

11:54.046 --> 11:56.389
parties of this war.

11:56.949 --> 12:17.572
And he also tried to bring peace to the different parties of the confessions between the Lutherans, Orthodox, and the other people who were somewhat liberals and so on.

12:17.592 --> 12:20.275
And a great, great lot of authors in his library.

12:20.295 --> 12:23.378
I think that these books

12:23.678 --> 12:30.428
his board for bringing arguments for his ideas and his confessions.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.912
Were scholars always welcome?

12:33.874 --> 12:34.274
Oh yes.

12:34.294 --> 12:35.696
Even while he was alive?

12:35.817 --> 12:36.217
Oh yes.

12:36.798 --> 12:48.196
The Duke lent his books to other scholars, and I think the Volcker Library was also a center of discussion for scholars.

12:48.756 --> 12:51.120
Scholars came not only from his own country,

12:51.286 --> 13:02.661
They came also from other countries in Germany or other great and important towns from southern Germany, like Nuremberg, Augsburg and so on.

13:02.901 --> 13:05.044
Not only scholars, but also poets.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.587
Poets were ever welcome.

13:07.687 --> 13:12.173
Would you say that his material largely supported a point of view?

13:14.376 --> 13:14.676
Yes.

13:16.399 --> 13:19.122
I think he supported a point of view.

13:19.443 --> 13:20.584
His point of view

13:20.699 --> 13:27.228
But also, you can also find naturally the books for the other side of the coin.

13:27.268 --> 13:28.389
But he collected them?

13:28.609 --> 13:29.971
Yes, he has collected them.

13:29.991 --> 13:30.452
Mindfully.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.453
Oh yes, he collected them.

13:31.674 --> 13:39.464
I think no book has come to his library without, that the Duke has said, okay.

13:40.445 --> 13:47.214
He also, every, each book was in his library, I think he has seen, he has told it in himself.

13:47.254 --> 13:47.955
Really?

13:48.290 --> 13:52.917
He paid the invoice, I think so.

13:52.937 --> 13:53.317
Really?

13:53.437 --> 13:53.838
Yeah, really.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.843
And was he also in charge of the acquisitions, or did he have staff who did that?

13:57.864 --> 14:00.027
Yes, he was in charge of the acquisitions.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.590
So he signed off on everything?

14:02.610 --> 14:08.138
There's a huge catalog of six volumes, and three of the six volumes he has written by his own hand.

14:08.877 --> 14:11.580
The titles are written there.

14:12.962 --> 14:18.848
Would you say he basically committed his life, dedicated his life to this project, or did he have other interests?

14:20.430 --> 14:23.293
I think he was a very, very busy man.

14:25.015 --> 14:28.419
From 6 a.m.

14:28.439 --> 14:32.223
till perhaps 6 p.m., he worked for his country.

14:33.044 --> 14:35.627
He ruled.

14:35.945 --> 14:38.989
He worked for his library.

14:40.712 --> 14:46.019
Did he give the library to his country before he died?

14:46.079 --> 14:48.522
No, no, no.

14:49.023 --> 15:02.762
He made his last will, and in this last will you can read the sentences about what I said, the great unmetall of his library, which means the library is for his country.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.505
and that this institution has to remain forever.

15:07.346 --> 15:15.576
And he doesn't say what his sons had to do with the library.

15:15.616 --> 15:21.344
And he didn't say you must buy books in the same way like I do, like I did.

15:22.425 --> 15:30.235
But he has written down that no one could say this library has to be

15:30.569 --> 15:36.375
put to another town, or we can sell the library.

15:36.935 --> 15:39.818
But he has said the library has to be here.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.379
It wasn't better forever.

15:41.400 --> 15:49.808
But under the auspices of the government, or just as like the Morgan Library is, you know, I mean, obviously Morgan left money to take care of it.

15:50.128 --> 15:51.589
Did he turn it over to the government?

15:52.210 --> 15:53.331
No, no, no.

15:54.032 --> 15:59.137
The financial situation was during his life very, very good.

15:59.157 --> 16:00.458
But after his death,

16:01.079 --> 16:03.743
The sons had other interests.

16:03.763 --> 16:11.294
They were collecting pictures of their times, of the 17th and then later on in the 18th century.

16:12.416 --> 16:16.142
There was no fixed fund for his library.

16:17.344 --> 16:23.433
At this time he spent a lot of money, but his sons, I think, hadn't great interest.

16:23.453 --> 16:28.200
But the library was opened for the public after his death for our public.

16:28.585 --> 16:38.419
For all people who were interested to read, they could come and learn the books for one week.

16:38.579 --> 16:39.320
Really?

16:39.561 --> 16:42.345
So they would actually allow the books to go out to circulate?

16:42.365 --> 16:43.526
Yes.

16:43.787 --> 16:47.392
Would you say, did he have any unique items or scarce items?

16:47.492 --> 16:53.040
Is this a library that is replicated elsewhere?

16:53.577 --> 16:57.782
describe the role, the function of this library.

16:57.802 --> 17:00.986
Does it fill any kind of a niche that is not available elsewhere?

17:01.046 --> 17:01.807
No.

17:02.768 --> 17:11.519
The people of August's times has also seen the great importance of the library.

17:11.539 --> 17:23.533
And there was a special... The devise about this, I think that told it the

17:23.902 --> 17:31.671
Eighth wonder of the world, achtes Weltwonder, for this library because of this.

17:31.991 --> 17:32.592
Really?

17:32.612 --> 17:33.993
Yes.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.094
Who called it this?

17:35.355 --> 17:40.080
Yes, it was Georg Philipp Haster, a German poet of Nordenberg, and other ones too.

17:43.023 --> 17:51.192
I think all people who had seen the books and had the possibility to work there,

17:51.577 --> 18:03.633
were very impressed and they knew that this is not to repeat at another town or another place and so on.

18:03.793 --> 18:08.119
If you were to compare this with anything, would you compare it, say, with the Morgan and the Huntington?

18:08.139 --> 18:10.162
It is an independent research library?

18:11.484 --> 18:16.791
It's today a research library.

18:16.811 --> 18:20.115
It's not independent because the library of the

18:20.382 --> 18:25.511
state of La Saxony, one of the states of Germany.

18:26.453 --> 18:36.891
But it's not the role to support an institution like a university or so on.

18:36.911 --> 18:37.893
It's there for scholars.

18:37.913 --> 18:38.133
OK.

18:38.153 --> 18:44.685
It's only for scholars and for all people who would like to come there and read until we're 15 years old.

18:45.070 --> 18:49.016
And do you get a lot of independent readers, people come in?

18:49.036 --> 18:49.417
That's okay.

18:49.757 --> 18:50.879
We have a lot of fellows.

18:51.520 --> 18:57.389
We have fellows from, I think, nearly all over the world.

18:57.409 --> 18:58.991
A lot of fellows come from the U.S.

19:00.213 --> 19:09.407
and therefore we founded, some years ago, also the Society of the American Friends of the library.

19:09.927 --> 19:12.932
We have since, I think, 25 years.

19:13.493 --> 19:17.079
Society of the Friends of the After Congress Library in Germany.

19:17.861 --> 19:26.215
And some years ago, the former fellows, having been for some time in Washington, have found it here.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.343
There must be a wonderful biography of him.

19:29.764 --> 19:33.628
Is there a good biography of him?

19:33.648 --> 19:42.118
I think it is necessary to write a new biography of Duke August.

19:42.258 --> 19:53.752
It's not so easy because he has a very long life and he has written a lot of material and he has read a lot of letters and so on.

19:53.772 --> 19:54.953
They are very interesting.

19:55.456 --> 20:05.973
But I think it will cost a lot of time and some years to write this biography.

20:05.993 --> 20:08.096
You need a good scholar to do this.

20:08.337 --> 20:12.283
I think a good scholar and he must be

20:12.567 --> 20:18.714
He must be willing to spend, I think, perhaps 10 years of his life to deal with this.

20:18.734 --> 20:20.176
There's a new biography of J.P.

20:20.216 --> 20:26.864
Morgan coming out shortly by Jean Strauss, and she's been working on it for about 15 years, as I understand.

20:27.104 --> 20:34.913
In our archives, and in the other archives of Laura Saxony, a lot of letters, the letters between Duke August,

20:35.264 --> 20:36.225
and his agents.

20:36.925 --> 20:44.913
Agents, they were people collecting and buying and selling books and pictures and furniture and so on.

20:45.633 --> 20:54.961
And with some of these agents in towns of Germany, in Augsburg and Nordenburg, he has built up his library.

20:54.981 --> 20:56.543
Did he have a want list?

20:56.563 --> 20:59.505
Did he send out lists of things that he wanted?

20:59.525 --> 21:02.528
Or was he basically buying contemporary things as they were issued?

21:02.688 --> 21:03.509
Yes.

21:03.569 --> 21:04.630
These agents.

21:04.863 --> 21:11.593
Perhaps there was one very famous man, Philip Heinhofer at Augsburg.

21:11.673 --> 21:15.478
H-A-I-N-H-O-F-E-R.

21:15.498 --> 21:16.600
Heinhofer.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.162
Philip Heinhofer.

21:18.182 --> 21:34.566
He's a very famous man who dealt with, I think, most of the courts in Europe and who sold books for them, books, pictures, furniture,

21:35.086 --> 21:51.811
clocks, and so on, and he had very, very good, very good senses for finding, for finding manuscripts, for finding books, which Duke August would like to have.

21:52.151 --> 21:59.963
He was a very, very, very important man for him, and I think each week, every week, a long guitar from Wolfram Wottel, from Duke,

22:00.398 --> 22:27.330
went to Philip Hainhofer in Augsburg, and also a week, a long letter came from Philip Hainhofer, the August, dealing with books, with the wishes of the Duke for having books and the answers of Mr. Hainhofer, telling which would be possible, this book or this book not, at the price, at the price, it was very, very important.

22:27.610 --> 22:29.292
Duke August was not a rich man.

22:29.963 --> 22:32.926
And he was dealing about the price.

22:32.946 --> 22:33.847
He was not a rich man?

22:33.887 --> 22:35.189
No, no, not a rich man.

22:35.890 --> 22:43.318
He was not a rich man, and for it, therefore, he dealt about the price of every book in a very hard form.

22:44.119 --> 22:45.881
He was not a rich man.

22:46.442 --> 22:52.388
And his country was destroyed by the war, and he had to build up this country.

22:54.731 --> 22:56.393
And he said the library is an instrument.

22:56.845 --> 23:05.399
The library is an instrument, yet I think his third wife had some of the money, and I think his wife gave him some money for building up the library.

23:06.040 --> 23:10.908
When did the state assume control of the library?

23:12.851 --> 23:13.873
Right after his death?

23:14.314 --> 23:22.988
When did the state take control of the library?

23:23.795 --> 23:27.400
Really after the First World War.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.020
Really?

23:28.441 --> 23:29.302
Yes.

23:30.063 --> 23:38.373
In 1919, the last Duke of Branding Wolfmittl was depossessed.

23:38.394 --> 23:44.461
He lost his reign, and he got some money, and then he should go away.

23:44.481 --> 23:52.992
And then there was, I think, a combination between the

23:53.242 --> 24:01.191
the court, the court of the dukes and the government of the country of Brunswick, which was there.

24:01.712 --> 24:09.060
This institution remained till after the Second World War.

24:09.080 --> 24:15.908
But I think it was not before 1955, 1955, that the state of Lower Saxony

24:16.563 --> 24:25.575
took this library as an institution of the state.

24:25.595 --> 24:28.559
And are you constantly, is it a constantly growing library?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.742
I mean, you said he had 135,000 titles.

24:30.823 --> 24:33.346
What's the size of it now?

24:33.686 --> 24:40.376
Oh, yes, but also, this is only one of our stocks of alternate books.

24:40.436 --> 24:45.743
Also, the books of the former university library at Helps that I told about the university,

24:46.263 --> 24:53.690
And we have also, I think, about 10 smaller private libraries of other dukes of Brunswick, Wolfenbottor.

24:53.730 --> 25:06.902
The library is now about the size of 800,000 books, and of these are perhaps 450,000 books before 1850.

25:06.922 --> 25:14.329
450,000 books before 1850, altogether a time

25:14.731 --> 25:27.690
about 800,000 printed books, 12,000 manuscripts, and of these 12,000 manuscripts, they are 3,500 medieval manuscripts.

25:27.770 --> 25:31.115
I think there's a lot of medieval manuscripts.

25:31.836 --> 25:42.291
We have also some special collections like prints, like portrait prints, and so on.

25:43.503 --> 26:05.983
And we are also collecting the books, the books of the art of the 20th century, the livres de peintre, artists' books, and books of the hand presses.

26:06.875 --> 26:12.021
as they say in the university world, a dedicated budget for the purchase of material every year?

26:12.061 --> 26:15.165
I mean, do you have a regular budget?

26:15.185 --> 26:20.792
Yes, we have a regular budget as a state library.

26:21.853 --> 26:29.462
The budget is altogether for one and a half million.

26:30.544 --> 26:33.287
One and a half million German marks.

26:33.824 --> 26:44.680
The library is, since some years, also the special libraries for books of the 17th century.

26:44.700 --> 26:45.581
17th?

26:45.601 --> 26:47.924
17th century.

26:48.886 --> 26:53.272
You know perhaps that Germany has no national library before 1912.

26:54.374 --> 26:57.779
Not before founding the Deutsche Bücherei.

26:57.979 --> 27:00.362
There is no national library.

27:01.043 --> 27:03.527
Ten years ago, they were made

27:04.081 --> 27:12.833
for building up the Displace National Library for the former centuries.

27:12.853 --> 27:16.879
There are five libraries dealing with this theme.

27:17.179 --> 27:22.306
This is the Bavarian State Library for the incredible time of the 16th century.

27:22.326 --> 27:25.651
This is the Hanzig August Library for the 17th century.

27:26.752 --> 27:31.118
This is the University Library of Göttingen for the 18th century.

27:31.722 --> 27:41.076
And the 19th, the 20th century, there are two libraries dealing with it.

27:41.176 --> 27:52.553
There's the University and State Library at Frankfurt on Main, and the State Library in Berlin.

27:52.573 --> 27:53.594
And where do you fit in?

27:53.614 --> 27:54.696
Where does your library fit in?

27:55.357 --> 27:58.101
Our library is for the 17th century.

27:59.262 --> 28:02.406
And basically it's a national library.

28:02.466 --> 28:02.766
Yes, okay.

28:02.786 --> 28:04.248
For the 17th century, yes.

28:05.610 --> 28:15.301
I think the Walkman Library has about 150,000 printed books of the 17th century.

28:15.321 --> 28:27.936
And now we can buy perhaps 400,000 German marks a year, books of the 17th century from the antiquarian market.

28:28.608 --> 28:40.961
Or is it possible to get the original books by second forms, like microfiche or microcups, or CD's, CD-ROMs?

28:41.582 --> 28:47.789
I was fascinated when I was in Leipzig that the YouTube book where I was 1912 and that it was established by the publishers.

28:48.890 --> 28:52.434
It was really established as a depository for their own books.

28:53.074 --> 28:56.438
You know, it's almost unique when you think of national libraries.

28:56.553 --> 29:04.982
Also, the successor institution, the Deutsche Bibliothek at Frankfurt am Main, was also founded as part by the publishers.

29:05.703 --> 29:10.388
And the other part were the town of Frankfurt am Main and the country of Hesha.

29:10.689 --> 29:18.197
And when I was there, they took me into the boardroom, and they have portraits of all the publishers on the wall, which is quite interesting.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.739
You don't really see that.

29:19.759 --> 29:23.623
Yes, I think the publishers would like

29:23.907 --> 29:33.880
at the beginning of the century that there must be an institution for collecting all books printed in Germany or printed about Germany and so on.

29:36.604 --> 29:44.955
Germany is very interesting as a national library today because you had the West Germany, the East Germany, you had the National Socialists.

29:45.796 --> 29:49.881
So I asked Dr. Lehmann

29:50.671 --> 29:54.014
how do you distinguish between, I mean, do politics enter into it?

29:54.035 --> 30:00.922
And he said, what we do is we collect everything in the German language, and that transcends political lines or about Germany.

30:00.942 --> 30:03.665
I mean, because it is an interesting consideration.

30:03.705 --> 30:08.590
With reunification, how do you decide what to collect and what not to collect?

30:08.610 --> 30:09.431
And he said, very simple.

30:09.491 --> 30:10.892
If it's in German, we collect it.

30:11.613 --> 30:12.053
It's okay.

30:12.434 --> 30:18.400
But it was so that also during the times of the

30:18.734 --> 30:28.545
German Democratic Republic, the publishers of the Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, sent one issue of the books to Leipzig.

30:29.647 --> 30:47.948
And did they send some... I remember I talked to you about Kurt Nowak at Frankfurt, and he was saying, even during the years of the two Germanys, we used to send each other books, you know, kind of this kind of misunderstanding that you would send each other books.

30:48.603 --> 30:50.585
And so now you do have these two institutions.

30:52.467 --> 30:57.913
And I'm very interested in the fact that they are trying to preserve everything.

30:57.993 --> 30:59.254
It doesn't matter what the book is.

30:59.314 --> 31:04.279
I mean, it can be a basically worthless old city directory.

31:04.680 --> 31:11.547
You know, they're going through this leaf casting and... I went through the whole place while they were doing this.

31:11.567 --> 31:12.588
I'm fascinated by this.

31:12.728 --> 31:15.771
You know, so many places will dump this stuff.

31:16.452 --> 31:17.513
You know, let me get rid of it.

31:17.847 --> 31:21.111
Out in San Francisco, I'm writing about the San Francisco Public Library.

31:21.131 --> 31:28.742
They built a new library and they set 200,000 books off to the landfill, quietly, to the dump, you know, to get rid of them.

31:28.762 --> 31:35.952
Yes, but I think you have also here at libraries who are collecting not only books, but also other special things.

31:36.092 --> 31:42.741
Your public library is collecting, I think, great special collections, great post-top and so on.

31:43.193 --> 31:48.599
Local history in particular is very interesting.

31:48.619 --> 31:56.829
The New York Public Library is one of the great libraries in the world, and the Boston Public Library is also quite a wonderful day.

31:56.849 --> 32:04.358
But a lot of public libraries are more or less advocating this responsibility as research libraries.

32:04.810 --> 32:10.077
I would say that Mr. Lehmann has done a very good job in unification.

32:10.117 --> 32:10.638
He has.

32:10.658 --> 32:15.485
These two libraries was not an easy task.

32:15.505 --> 32:20.471
But I think this was without any difficulties getting out.

32:21.573 --> 32:27.441
The other way is unification of the two libraries in Berlin.

32:28.442 --> 32:29.704
They are only struggling.

32:29.920 --> 32:41.470
But now Mr. Lehmann will go as the president of the foundation to Berlin in February and then I think he will also... I'm sorry, I missed that.

32:41.510 --> 32:51.980
What is happening with the... Klaus Lehmann is the future president of the foundation that is a very, very huge institution for culture in Germany.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.885
So he's leaving his country... He's leaving Frankfurt and he's going to Berlin at the beginning of the next year.

32:58.895 --> 33:06.024
And then I think he would at first unificate these two libraries, these two state libraries in West and in East Berlin.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.590
So he's kind of a work of magic in Berlin now, too, I guess.

33:11.610 --> 33:12.952
I think so, yes.

33:12.972 --> 33:15.195
I don't know if you have seen this.

33:15.215 --> 33:22.984
This was a very political thing in Germany before the elections in September.

33:24.466 --> 33:26.809
The government of the Federal Republic,

33:27.008 --> 33:39.918
The chancellor, Mr. Coro, had a known attendant for the job, and the country, the so-called lender, had another, and this was Clausi de Lehmann, another.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.950
But that had to wait until the elections, and after changing the government,

33:45.284 --> 33:46.586
He is the candidate.

33:47.808 --> 33:51.053
So he wasn't affected by the results of the election?

33:51.073 --> 33:51.594
He was not?

33:51.955 --> 33:53.417
No, no, no.

33:53.958 --> 34:03.013
He was chosen, I think, two weeks ago as president, and I think he will start his new job in January or February.

34:03.614 --> 34:04.595
I'll have to send him.

34:04.635 --> 34:11.967
We had a pretty nice correspondence, and I had a very nice interview with him when I was in Germany.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.901
This is very interesting.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.823
I like the way he did the division.

34:16.223 --> 34:29.935
In Leipzig, they are concentrating on preservation, and they are dividing up responsibilities a little bit, instead of working in competition with each other.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.839
That was my sense of how they were doing things.

34:34.859 --> 34:41.565
Yes, I have only a small insight in the institution, but I think

34:41.798 --> 34:56.058
I think he has made his politics dealing with Leipzig and Frankfurt that they should do nothing in another way but they should give up nothing.

34:56.980 --> 35:08.616
They should continue all things they have done but no one could say you are doing the same thing at Frankfurt and at Leipzig.

35:08.798 --> 35:18.532
It was a very great success, but nobody could say they had to do double things at Leipzig and at Frankfurt.

35:18.913 --> 35:32.933
They have divided their work in a very clear sense, and they had no problems I think with the jobs and so on, and all people I think are

35:33.368 --> 35:35.530
Mostly content.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.411
Mostly.

35:37.112 --> 35:39.315
I didn't sense any disquietude.

35:39.795 --> 35:45.742
Maybe a little bit in Leipzig, but people who were happier under the GDPR.

35:45.902 --> 35:48.185
I was surprised to see that.

35:48.205 --> 35:56.354
I think there was also a problem with the money, because the jobs are not paid to the same level.

35:57.476 --> 36:03.122
And the former federal public people,

36:03.592 --> 36:08.778
I'm working in the libraries and other institutions.

36:09.739 --> 36:12.402
The civil service gets twenty percent more.

36:13.383 --> 36:24.656
I think in perhaps five or six years they're all getting the same money, but today there are differences.

36:24.676 --> 36:29.201
You know Michael Norman, the fellow who left Henry Holt?

36:29.361 --> 36:31.624
That's my publisher, Holt.

36:31.840 --> 36:40.528
He was the head of the publishing house that I went back to Germany.

36:40.569 --> 36:41.449
I just point that out.

36:41.509 --> 36:48.997
So I was following his fortunes here in a curious situation.

36:49.858 --> 36:53.281
Well, this is fascinating.

36:53.621 --> 36:57.025
It is interesting that Germany never did have a national library prior to 1912.

36:57.145 --> 37:00.548
I mean, this is a country with such a profoundly

37:00.848 --> 37:02.030
profound book culture.

37:03.332 --> 37:08.522
Yes, I think the reason is the history of Germany.

37:09.403 --> 37:22.587
Germany was unificated by the Chancellor Bismarck in 1871, politically unificated, but not in a cultural sense.

37:22.870 --> 37:26.433
Already, already after this unification.

37:26.473 --> 37:27.594
Now what year was that again, I'm sorry?

37:28.235 --> 37:29.276
What year was that again?

37:29.376 --> 37:30.237
This was in 1871.

37:30.577 --> 37:39.285
The Chancellor of Bismarck, right, the unification of the German country to one government.

37:39.925 --> 37:52.877
But in the cultural thinking and cultural sense, the former countries remained.

37:53.785 --> 38:08.952
They also, the countries, had ever a great interest not to give up their own possibilities to a central government.

38:08.972 --> 38:15.945
And today, I think it would be impossible to found

38:16.651 --> 38:26.188
national libraries for the older old times the state of Bavaria the state of Baden-Württemberg

38:26.506 --> 38:31.091
It's like Italy, really, in many respects.

38:31.171 --> 38:32.953
You have six national libraries.

38:33.233 --> 38:41.422
You have the Marziana, Naples, Venice, Milan, and the Marziana is strictly Venice.

38:41.442 --> 38:47.949
I mean, that's Venetian history, and you really only have two depository libraries in Italy, but it's the same kind of situation.

38:48.010 --> 38:50.252
Italy wasn't unified until 1876.

38:50.502 --> 38:57.872
Yes, in Germany we have the Deutsche Bibliothek, the depository library for the whole country.

38:58.433 --> 39:04.702
And then I think each country has his own depository library.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.168
Each country of Germany?

39:09.188 --> 39:10.349
Each country of Germany.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.612
Lower Saxony... So we still call them countries?

39:13.874 --> 39:16.998
Yes, Germany has 15 countries.

39:17.359 --> 39:18.160
They're called countries?

39:18.460 --> 39:20.323
Countries, Linda.

39:20.523 --> 39:24.607
country, not regions, lander countries.

39:24.848 --> 39:26.149
How do you spell lander?

39:26.910 --> 39:29.192
L-A with two points.

39:30.473 --> 39:32.015
L-A-E, I think, right?

39:32.035 --> 39:34.938
L-A-E-N-D-E-R.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.482
L-A-E-N-D-E-R.

39:38.682 --> 39:40.364
Because they're still called countries.

39:40.925 --> 39:42.046
There are 15 of them.

39:42.066 --> 39:42.827
15, yes, 15.

39:43.567 --> 39:48.032
And I think most of them have so-called

39:48.569 --> 39:53.095
and national libraries of their countries.

39:53.115 --> 39:56.720
And these libraries are depositary libraries.

39:56.740 --> 39:57.541
For that region?

39:57.561 --> 39:59.543
For the region, for this country, yes.

39:59.804 --> 40:11.639
And all publishers have to give one issue of a book to this Landespiritique, to this national library of the country, and the other one to Frankfurt.

40:11.799 --> 40:12.520
So we have two.

40:12.841 --> 40:17.547
So how do you...

40:18.016 --> 40:25.646
evaluate, how do you see the state of book culture in Germany today?

40:25.666 --> 40:28.630
And that's a very wide-ranging phrase.

40:28.910 --> 40:31.573
I don't even know if you subscribe to it.

40:31.754 --> 40:34.337
I can say I'm not afraid.

40:36.800 --> 40:40.745
I'm not afraid about the future of the book culture in Germany.

40:41.106 --> 40:46.993
I think every year in October at the Frankfurt Book Fair you can see

40:47.480 --> 41:01.643
70,000 new books, 70,000, 70,000 new books, or perhaps 80,000 new books, and there are also some people who call every year, this is the end of the book.

41:02.224 --> 41:03.246
I don't think so.

41:04.227 --> 41:10.698
All publishers are making a lot of books, and are making a lot of CD-ROMs, and digitalization, and so on.

41:11.359 --> 41:13.302
We have a very different

41:13.737 --> 41:19.162
different scene of media, like here in your country too.

41:20.383 --> 41:32.434
I don't think that the books will lose their part in the scene.

41:32.954 --> 41:33.875
Tell me about yourself.

41:33.895 --> 41:37.218
Are you a librarian or are you a scholar?

41:37.378 --> 41:42.563
A little bit about your background, how you come to be the person you are.

41:42.813 --> 41:47.761
I've studied history, literature, and philosophy.

41:50.205 --> 41:53.550
I've made my incriminations and my philosophy doctor.

41:56.315 --> 42:08.955
I would prefer to make an academic career, but there was no job, no possibility, and therefore I had to look for another job.

42:09.475 --> 42:15.260
And I quickly mentioned to work in a library, and this is a very little way to go there.

42:16.762 --> 42:26.411
In Germany, the academic librarians have to make an education after finishing their studies for two years.

42:27.331 --> 42:37.761
One year they work practically in the library, and the second year they have to go to an education institution for librarianship.

42:37.781 --> 42:38.942
I've been at Cologne.

42:39.091 --> 42:49.904
here as one of the institutions, and then you have to make the second examination, and then you can try to get a job.

42:49.924 --> 42:52.227
I'd love to come visit your library sometime.

42:52.307 --> 42:53.368
I'm going to give you my card.

42:54.009 --> 42:57.133
Oh, thank you very much.

42:58.314 --> 43:00.617
That's my email address there, too.

43:00.637 --> 43:02.319
Maybe we can correspond by email.

43:02.559 --> 43:03.501
Oh, excellent.

43:03.541 --> 43:05.503
Yes, Dr. Arnold, yes.

43:06.682 --> 43:09.526
That's wonderful.

43:11.088 --> 43:14.113
How long are you here for in the States?

43:14.133 --> 43:14.353
Here?

43:14.633 --> 43:17.397
Yes, I'm here only for the exhibition.

43:17.437 --> 43:21.203
I've come last Saturday and I'll go back tomorrow.

43:22.164 --> 43:23.706
Oh, I'm glad we were able to.

43:24.187 --> 43:33.921
I mean, I would have, I was telling Steve, this is a trip I would have made for this interview, you know, but now I can go home and transcribe this and now

43:34.357 --> 43:36.920
think of more questions to ask you.

43:36.940 --> 43:40.723
Yes, I think you should perhaps read all these small books.

43:41.044 --> 43:44.567
I think the second part is English.

43:44.647 --> 43:47.050
You can write your question by email.

43:47.070 --> 43:47.550
Exactly.

43:47.630 --> 43:50.333
And this is your library?

43:50.673 --> 43:51.214
The future.

43:51.654 --> 43:53.316
Oh, that's the future.

43:53.336 --> 43:56.079
Yes, we have some old buildings.

43:56.099 --> 44:02.005
And we have one old building which must be rebuilt.

44:02.465 --> 44:04.127
It's an old corn house.

44:04.478 --> 44:20.034
corners of the second half of the Augustine Hall, the old corners of the second half of the seventeenth century, and we would like to re-build this house for our library in the future.

44:20.255 --> 44:32.207
So would you describe this, and I hate to ask a silly question about it, but is this a unique library in your view, or is it part of a larger system?

44:32.474 --> 44:38.721
It's not a unique library in the combination of old printed books and modern scholarly books.

44:38.781 --> 44:46.930
This is the typical library type in Germany and in France and in England and so on.

44:47.350 --> 44:56.641
It's still a unique library in the combination of being a library and being a scholarly institution.

44:57.121 --> 45:00.625
The library has the possibilities to give fellowships

45:01.313 --> 45:09.248
and to organize meetings for other people, for academic people and universities and so on.

45:09.930 --> 45:14.158
I think you hear some

45:14.442 --> 45:17.947
research libraries would do this in a lot of years.

45:18.147 --> 45:18.808
Something like this.

45:18.988 --> 45:20.050
Like the Morgan and the Hunter.

45:20.070 --> 45:21.391
The Morgan and the Hunter.

45:21.411 --> 45:25.097
I apologize for Shakespeare.

45:25.137 --> 45:28.361
We know the colleagues there.

45:28.401 --> 45:32.326
But this is in Germany still a Jungunig type.

45:33.328 --> 45:43.842
Perhaps in the next years also other libraries like the Herzogin Anna Amalia Library at Weimar will also perhaps have the possibility

45:44.311 --> 45:47.456
they are going in this direction.

45:47.476 --> 45:53.765
But I don't think they will be successful to get to this aim.

45:54.506 --> 45:59.534
But in this sense, Wolpert is a unique library in Germany.

45:59.554 --> 46:02.558
You know, I read a lot of magazine articles about libraries, too.

46:03.139 --> 46:06.925
It sounds like yours would be a perfect candidate for one of my stories.

46:07.025 --> 46:07.286
Yes.

46:08.868 --> 46:09.489
We're proud of it.

46:10.831 --> 46:12.293
I think I'd really like to

46:13.049 --> 46:13.990
I had a question.

46:14.210 --> 46:17.694
Are you familiar with the bookseller Heriber Tentrit?

46:18.676 --> 46:21.799
Tentrit is one of our... I had to go to him last year.

46:21.899 --> 46:24.082
I went to visit him in Switzerland, as a matter of fact.

46:24.522 --> 46:37.478
I think we buy some books of the 17th century by him, but... He deals, basically, with very wealthy... He deals, basically, with very wealthy and so on, and his prices, his level is very high.

46:37.518 --> 46:39.580
He told me, basically, as business...

46:40.454 --> 46:43.057
He deals basically with about 25 people in the world.

46:43.137 --> 46:49.465
And he said his gross is $50 million a year.

46:49.485 --> 46:51.948
I've never heard of a bookseller doing that kind of business.

46:52.169 --> 46:53.851
It's amazing.

46:53.871 --> 46:57.155
I think his main partners are private collectors.

46:57.375 --> 46:58.417
I think so.

46:58.497 --> 47:00.920
He has a lot of money.

47:01.140 --> 47:06.006
He told me that last year when I was there he had a bad year because three of his collectors

47:06.863 --> 47:08.005
had various problems.

47:08.406 --> 47:09.549
One had problems with the law.

47:09.669 --> 47:10.891
I mean, income taxes.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.835
Another one died, I think.

47:12.875 --> 47:13.978
That's a real problem.

47:14.358 --> 47:20.491
But just two or three collectors can really make a very significant influence.

47:20.872 --> 47:22.295
It'll be a very interesting story.

47:22.695 --> 47:25.902
I'm also very interested in the whole concept of the scholar-bookseller.

47:26.438 --> 47:29.282
I mean, he really is quite an interest.

47:29.302 --> 47:30.704
He writes all of his catalogs.

47:30.764 --> 47:39.675
He seems to really know his... And like yourself, he studied to be a university professor.

47:41.318 --> 47:41.658
Yeah.

47:41.738 --> 47:50.470
Teter makes very, very, very good catalogs, catalogs of a very high level in bibliographic sense and so on.

47:50.550 --> 47:55.416
And I think he invested a lot of money in these catalogs.

47:55.852 --> 48:10.573
And we have in Germany, for some years, some other antiquarian antiquarians, which also try to make their deals of a very financial, very high level.

48:10.713 --> 48:18.484
Starting with, I think, about 10,000, 15,000 DMs and going higher.

48:18.835 --> 48:24.342
And not to deal with the... Because Germany lost so many of its booksellers during the war.

48:25.484 --> 48:46.412
A lot of the Jewish booksellers who came here... You know, Stephen, he comes back to Germany, to Leipzig book fair, and brings him, and he and his friends, other friends, he come for them, they bring... I introduced those two fellows, by the way, who came... They bring these books back to Germany.

48:46.696 --> 48:50.781
The last year, when they were for the first time in Leipzig.

48:50.801 --> 48:54.625
That's very interesting to me.

48:54.665 --> 49:03.075
They had amazing, a lot of books of the 16th and 17th century, and I asked them about these books.

49:03.095 --> 49:15.370
And yes, these are the books of the collections of former Jewish booksellers, people of Germany who were exiled to study.

49:15.772 --> 49:19.836
And their children are no longer interested in these books.

49:20.236 --> 49:21.417
They cannot read these books.

49:21.457 --> 49:22.198
They're interested.

49:22.218 --> 49:24.780
And then, yet, now they come back.

49:24.800 --> 49:25.881
They're starting to come back.

49:25.901 --> 49:26.982
Well, I'm writing about that.

49:27.103 --> 49:35.030
You see, it is very interesting that the booksellers who left, who came here to New York or went to Canada, went to South America.

49:35.591 --> 49:37.973
I interviewed Nico Israel in Holland.

49:37.993 --> 49:39.614
Of course, he didn't leave.

49:39.694 --> 49:43.618
But these were, they knew what the books were.

49:43.970 --> 49:47.334
And, of course, right after the war, people were in desperate need of money.

49:48.275 --> 49:51.840
These books left Germany, and now you say they're coming back?

49:51.880 --> 49:53.462
They're coming back.

49:53.662 --> 49:56.966
In volume, or little by little, or...?

49:58.228 --> 49:59.029
I don't know.

49:59.189 --> 50:11.985
I asked them, and one of the entrepreneurs said, he thinks that this process could endure for about ten years or so.

50:12.134 --> 50:15.218
Are you impressed by the quality of the books?

50:15.238 --> 50:19.064
Very, very, very, in very good condition.

50:19.084 --> 50:21.227
And how about the content and the titles?

50:21.608 --> 50:25.113
Yes, I think most of them were very interesting.

50:25.433 --> 50:31.041
Stephen told me yesterday that one of his colleagues had made a very good deal in Leipzig.

50:31.061 --> 50:37.551
He has sold books for, what did he say, $150,000.

50:38.111 --> 50:39.754
That's the fellow I introduced to him.

50:40.254 --> 50:40.435
Yes.

50:40.795 --> 50:42.057
I introduced those to him.

50:42.357 --> 50:45.401
I'm on a radio program with this other guy.

50:45.421 --> 50:48.004
And he called me and he said, gee, I've got this German library.

50:48.564 --> 50:49.325
What should I do with it?

50:49.686 --> 50:53.250
I said, well, let me put you in touch with somebody because I knew Steve and I were talking.

50:54.651 --> 51:04.242
Yes, I think that Leipzig is very interested in these antiquarian books because this is the only chance for the Leipzig Fair against Frankfurt.

51:04.263 --> 51:11.571
This is a very, I think, a real chance to get a part of this market

51:11.905 --> 51:15.914
if they specialize in two indigenous books.

51:15.934 --> 51:22.870
And do you think this is an attitude throughout Germany, that Germany is interested in bringing these books back to Germany?

51:23.271 --> 51:23.411
Oh yes.

51:23.431 --> 51:28.362
It is part of the word they use in France, part of the national patrimony.

51:28.814 --> 51:31.037
There's no question about that.

51:31.117 --> 51:32.780
And what specifically are you looking for?

51:32.980 --> 51:35.965
Books in your century, in your 17th century era?

51:36.285 --> 51:41.573
Yes, if we find books in our century, we try to get them.

51:42.795 --> 51:51.809
There are sometimes problems when the prices are too high, but we can also deal with the antiquarians.

51:52.430 --> 51:58.078
I think we have got for the last years most of the books we would like to have.

51:58.784 --> 51:59.485
in our library.

52:01.328 --> 52:10.260
Fortunately, books of the 17th century are still not too high-level priced.

52:10.861 --> 52:11.121
Really?

52:11.702 --> 52:12.563
I think so, yeah.

52:12.583 --> 52:14.366
They're not too high-priced.

52:14.426 --> 52:15.367
They're accessible.

52:15.387 --> 52:24.299
You cannot compare the prices of books of the 17th century with books of the 16th century.

52:24.320 --> 52:25.741
Oh, and the Incunible, of course.

52:26.082 --> 52:28.285
Books of the 16th century are, I think,

52:28.568 --> 52:34.459
at least, double or third times priced like the books of the 17th century.

52:34.479 --> 52:37.725
The 17th is still accessible.

52:37.745 --> 52:38.727
Accessible.

52:39.127 --> 52:42.113
A lot of small, very small books survive.

52:42.133 --> 52:51.049
You can get for 1,000 or 2,000 DM a lot of books survive, but you can't get any book of the 16th century

52:51.637 --> 52:53.219
for 1,000 DM.

52:53.479 --> 52:58.244
Perhaps if it is destroyed, then it will be possible.

52:58.264 --> 53:05.692
By the way, I know you probably want to get downstairs pretty soon, but were there a lot of books destroyed in the war?

53:06.232 --> 53:12.799
World War II, were there a lot of books and libraries destroyed in the war?

53:12.819 --> 53:15.322
What was the extent of war damage?

53:15.382 --> 53:17.104
Professor Dieter Lehmann

53:17.708 --> 53:25.978
said to me, when I was in Leipzig, he said, well, we had a Gutenberg Bible here, it's still in Russia, you know, and we would like some point to get those back.

53:26.599 --> 53:36.511
I think we have learned during the last nine years that I think most of the books haven't been destroyed by the war.

53:36.791 --> 53:37.753
Why not?

53:37.853 --> 53:41.337
They have been stolen after the war.

53:42.413 --> 53:45.518
That's right.

53:46.219 --> 53:52.089
When I was at Mount Athos, in this one library, there was a beautiful geography.

53:52.570 --> 53:53.832
You know, ancient.

53:53.852 --> 53:57.478
And very cleanly cut out of that were the maps of England and Ireland.

53:57.498 --> 54:01.444
You know, some Englishman came through and cut it out, and it's in the British line for me.

54:01.685 --> 54:04.049
And you'd think they would return that to the book.

54:04.069 --> 54:04.950
You know, they won't do that.

54:07.254 --> 54:08.556
This is very good.

54:08.941 --> 54:11.205
There should be a few books that I could consult.

54:11.225 --> 54:21.721
I mean, I do a lot of reading at Harvard, so there should be some books on... Do you think that there is a biography on this gentleman that might be useful for background information for me?

54:23.424 --> 54:24.906
But I'll send you an email.

54:25.227 --> 54:26.989
Yes, okay.

54:27.630 --> 54:30.215
I think you probably want to get downstairs.

54:33.420 --> 54:34.341
Exhibition.

54:35.131 --> 54:42.645
I think we spent two years for working about this with the roller club here.

54:43.426 --> 54:47.113
Yes, it's a real experiment for us.

54:48.035 --> 54:49.498
It's the first time this way.

54:49.618 --> 54:51.942
And what's the point of it?

54:52.546 --> 54:55.469
because it's a good idea to have exhibitions outside the country.

54:56.129 --> 55:01.834
We think that globalization is not only an economic problem, also a cultural problem.

55:02.875 --> 55:04.236
Yes, I think so.

55:04.316 --> 55:16.086
And we wanted to take this chance to introduce us here to the States with such an exhibition.

55:16.927 --> 55:21.591
The other point of view is the support of the

55:21.942 --> 55:25.306
Society of the Friends here in the U.S.

55:25.326 --> 55:25.827
States.

55:25.847 --> 55:28.090
So is this basically a first for the library?

55:28.150 --> 55:29.592
Have you done this kind of thing before?

55:30.292 --> 55:30.673
Elsewhere?

55:31.975 --> 55:43.409
We have made a lot of exhibitions, but it's the first time that we made such a great exhibition with our main treasures outside Germany.

55:43.429 --> 55:44.110
Are you anxious?

55:45.351 --> 55:46.353
Not really.

55:46.673 --> 55:49.857
Not really anxious, but I can say you are the

55:50.444 --> 55:56.874
The insurance value is 50 million German Mark.

55:56.894 --> 55:58.697
Therefore, you see there are treasures.

55:58.717 --> 56:03.785
The value is 50 million German Mark for insurance.

56:04.526 --> 56:07.310
Not just for the materials here, for the whole collection.

56:07.771 --> 56:09.714
No, no, no, for this year, for this year.

56:09.874 --> 56:10.295
For this year?

56:10.315 --> 56:12.418
50 million German D Mark, yes.

56:12.702 --> 56:17.429
Yes, and therefore, I'd say you can see the terms here.

56:17.449 --> 56:18.471
I can't wait.

56:18.491 --> 56:27.745
Without one manuscript, the so-called Evangelia of Duke Henry the Lion, this isn't possible to bring out of our country.

56:27.765 --> 56:33.394
It's a national cultural heritage in which must have been...

56:33.762 --> 56:40.208
impose the same kind of restrictions on the export of national treasures the way France does, for instance, in England now.

56:40.228 --> 56:40.949
Yes, I think so.

56:42.030 --> 56:46.134
And this is more recent, of course, before you could, obviously, some of these things could leave the country.

56:46.154 --> 56:48.256
Now that's impossible, right?

56:48.476 --> 57:02.149
All countries have so-called lists of national heritages, of martial heritages, and all things, books or pictures or other things you can imagine which are listed there cannot be

57:02.703 --> 57:04.806
brought out of the country.

57:05.466 --> 57:09.071
And the Evangelia of Henry the Lion is on this list.

57:09.231 --> 57:10.292
It's impossible.

57:10.613 --> 57:13.476
I can't wait to get out of it.

57:13.776 --> 57:17.341
You can only come to Boston.

57:19.163 --> 57:22.387
I think I've tried to explain it in a very short way.

57:22.848 --> 57:31.478
It's starting two cases of the original conviction of the Duke Library and his own first catalogs, you can see here.

57:31.964 --> 57:57.330
and then his first alphabetic catalogue, this is not the real catalogue, this real catalogue was founded at first into disciplines, and then into the accession, built up in the accession of the books, and to find his own books again, the Duke

57:57.648 --> 58:03.620
has to start as a short, as well as a catalogue that you can see here.

58:05.203 --> 58:11.535
Raphael Lucelius, Maratus de Lucinga, Anton Lucius, Lucenius, Lopanus, and so on.

58:12.156 --> 58:16.585
There's only the nine, and then the shelf marks.

58:16.953 --> 58:21.439
Is this in his hand, by the way?

58:21.499 --> 58:22.741
This is in his hand.

58:23.242 --> 58:31.273
This is the old room, the old room, the castle, and the library was built up.

58:31.413 --> 58:35.839
You can see the Duke.

58:35.819 --> 58:36.620
Where is he?

58:36.700 --> 58:38.683
Standing there.

58:39.003 --> 58:40.565
That's wonderful.

58:40.585 --> 58:47.835
This is August, different stages of his life.

58:47.935 --> 58:54.744
He is a young man, in this way to begin a time.

58:54.985 --> 59:02.755
I told you, this is a book about the chest.

59:03.089 --> 59:04.951
I think at the right hand, he is sitting there.

59:05.092 --> 59:08.736
That is he, as a young man, I think.

59:08.756 --> 59:14.243
Another interest was the cryptography of Gehypschrift.

59:14.263 --> 59:19.109
He developed a different system of cryptography.

59:19.270 --> 59:27.460
He has written a book about this, his manuscript for this book.

59:27.777 --> 59:38.919
You know, one thing I was going to ask upstairs, we were talking about how the Ambrosiana was founded by Cardinal Borromeo as an expression of the Counter-Reformation.

59:38.939 --> 59:45.111
Do you think this library was established as an expression for

59:46.019 --> 59:57.684
The foundation of the library in the 16th century, this is in the context of the Reformation, I'm very sure.

59:58.085 --> 59:59.488
No question about this.

59:59.628 --> 01:00:04.298
No question, but August was a refounder in the century.

01:00:04.683 --> 01:00:12.012
He's also, this is a library which is oriented in the Protestantic and Protestantic.

01:00:12.252 --> 01:00:17.518
But he was very often, he was very open for all directions.

01:00:18.139 --> 01:00:20.382
He didn't have a closed mind, in a way.

01:00:20.482 --> 01:00:33.137
Yes, the beginning of the Spanish scripts, medieval manuscripts from France and Germany, the Spanish scripts from early medieval times.

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:42.949
You see, these dates are almost exactly the same dates when Borromeo was establishing the Ambrosiana.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.075
It was like 1609, 16, right around there.

01:00:46.095 --> 01:00:50.283
So you almost have the sense that you have these libraries going up in opposition to each other.

01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:55.193
Maybe I'm overreaching on this, I don't know.

01:00:55.645 --> 01:01:21.282
You can see one of our famous manuscripts from the ... from the ... And there's a very, very slight binding of ... And this is, I think, really a unique ...

01:01:21.532 --> 01:01:27.300
type of manuscripts, the so-called Tyronian notes.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.421
Wow.

01:01:29.683 --> 01:01:31.565
That's a thousand years ago.

01:01:31.585 --> 01:01:35.490
The highest, the greatest present of these works are the so-called Jackson Speeder.

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:44.903
This is the manuscript of the High Middle Times of the Rite spoken in the country.

01:01:45.263 --> 01:01:47.286
The great value comes from the

01:01:47.266 --> 01:02:03.547
Congratulations on the exhibition.

01:02:03.627 --> 01:02:03.948
It's wonderful.

01:02:03.968 --> 01:02:07.232
Thank you.

01:02:07.415 --> 01:02:08.696
We're having a little interview.

01:02:08.736 --> 01:02:31.802
He's giving me a... Have you been in the... It's 14th century.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.802
So he was a bibliophile.

01:02:34.843 --> 01:02:39.849
He was also collecting for beauty and for rarity.

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:42.713
That's a Wycliffe library.

01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:45.898
Wow.

01:02:46.438 --> 01:02:50.404
That is unbelievable.

01:02:50.424 --> 01:02:57.233
You know the medieval poems?

01:02:57.517 --> 01:03:11.691
This is unbelievable.

01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:15.916
Do we know who the artists are of these?

01:03:16.336 --> 01:03:17.117
Never do, do we?

01:03:17.177 --> 01:03:23.203
That is quite remarkable.

01:03:23.437 --> 01:03:30.706
Early modern times, 16th century and so on.

01:03:31.427 --> 01:03:34.131
Tournament books, I believe.

01:03:37.135 --> 01:03:43.342
These pictures are very colored and so on.

01:03:44.264 --> 01:03:45.265
Are these printed books?

01:03:46.206 --> 01:03:46.827
Yes.

01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:47.688
Printed books.

01:03:48.008 --> 01:03:48.709
Printed books.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:52.414
But they're hand-colored pictures.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:07.956
In the autumn of August, in the autumn of the library in Latin, the census, census, everybody who is commissioned to the library and hearing who can use the books.

01:04:08.476 --> 01:04:13.161
should all the books get back and should not steal.

01:04:13.441 --> 01:04:14.402
And it's dated 1636.

01:04:14.703 --> 01:04:15.343
Yes.

01:04:15.524 --> 01:04:25.014
Because these books should be useful for other ones too, and not only for a single person to take back.

01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:28.538
And this was brought over for this exhibition as well.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.743
This must have been quite a job, putting all this material together.

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:35.445
Yes.

01:04:35.628 --> 01:04:47.685
I told you he was very interested in theology and he also tried to make a new translation of the Bible because it was not contained with Martin Luther's works.

01:04:47.845 --> 01:04:52.191
He was not content with Martin Luther's works.

01:04:52.211 --> 01:05:01.804
He tried really to make a new translation but this was in his older times and he died about this work.

01:05:01.784 --> 01:05:03.687
So these are all his annotations?

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:04.869
That's okay.

01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:09.778
This is the beginning of the new translation.

01:05:09.798 --> 01:05:10.960
And he was attempting it himself?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.981
Yes, I think.

01:05:12.001 --> 01:05:13.364
But he found it himself.

01:05:13.384 --> 01:05:14.906
This is the new August.

01:05:14.926 --> 01:05:17.831
It's the symbol of Augusta.

01:05:19.234 --> 01:05:26.526
I'm surprised that there isn't a really... It feels like he really deserves an important biography.

01:05:26.945 --> 01:05:31.350
This is Martin Luther.

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:36.917
1522, very famous.

01:05:36.957 --> 01:05:38.218
Excellent.

01:05:38.779 --> 01:05:40.921
And how many items all together in the exhibition?

01:05:40.941 --> 01:05:41.482
Fifty-eight.

01:05:41.782 --> 01:05:43.044
Fifty-eight.

01:05:43.484 --> 01:05:46.187
Yes, this is one of the great strikers, Nicolaus Deutonicus.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.452
And whose annotations are these?

01:05:52.134 --> 01:05:52.615
Do we know?

01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:53.796
Yes.

01:05:53.928 --> 01:06:01.558
This is the text of the author, Nicholas Copernicus.

01:06:02.078 --> 01:06:06.364
Really?

01:06:06.404 --> 01:06:06.704
Wow.

01:06:06.724 --> 01:06:13.653
I'm very interested in Owen Gingrich, who went around the world to handle every person's edition of Copernicus.

01:06:13.673 --> 01:06:14.574
That's why I was curious.

01:06:14.594 --> 01:06:18.099
This is one of our great, a lot of astrolabias.

01:06:20.442 --> 01:06:21.403
But this one is

01:06:21.383 --> 01:06:22.926
in a very, very high standard.

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:31.185
Most of them are destroyed because I think children turn around.

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:36.777
A very early interactive book, we might say.

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:45.838
books, nice, nice, nice to see here, I think.

01:06:46.239 --> 01:07:06.578
I think there is also a chronicle box of the 17th, 17th century, and we have also

01:07:06.659 --> 01:07:12.468
collected some books because of their standard binding.

01:07:12.508 --> 01:07:18.317
You can see the binding is standing here.

01:07:18.557 --> 01:07:27.090
Franz Laurentier was the court cook of one of the dukes of Hans-Holfe Bartol in the 16th century.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:33.780
He couldn't read and he couldn't write, and he dictated to a writer, and his writer

01:07:34.334 --> 01:07:36.898
And that's his recipes there.

01:07:36.918 --> 01:07:53.322
Yes, you know, New York arteries have a great tradition of

01:07:53.504 --> 01:08:00.792
The reception of books of Rome and Greece, they have a great path to discovery.

01:08:00.812 --> 01:08:06.658
And this is also books for them, not only the virtual, but human.

01:08:06.678 --> 01:08:11.383
It's clear that human has this must be seen here.

01:08:11.403 --> 01:08:20.473
And these books are also tonight, all of their illustrations.

01:08:21.112 --> 01:08:22.574
And he acquired all of these.

01:08:22.634 --> 01:08:25.919
These were all acquired during his lifetime, do you believe?

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:27.701
That's amazing.

01:08:27.721 --> 01:08:29.484
Let's see.

01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:29.944
Yes.

01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:33.529
One of the most famous, can I hear?

01:08:33.549 --> 01:08:34.991
Francesca Colonna.

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:39.938
I think that's one of the... It's an album, of course.

01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:41.721
Yeah, yes.

01:08:41.881 --> 01:08:50.393
One of the nice, nice, interesting of the late 15th century.

01:08:50.373 --> 01:09:16.161
Do you have any favorites?

01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:20.818
Yes, I think I have something that works.

01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:46.890
So, this book here, one of the books, the story of the Emperor Maximilian I, written by himself, and I think the illustrations are very, very fine because of the comments used here.

01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:49.789
The entry of Emperor Charles.

01:09:50.431 --> 01:09:55.523
Symbol on the end.

01:09:55.543 --> 01:09:56.846
Remarkable.

01:10:00.694 --> 01:10:01.617
Thank you so much.

01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:02.499
Thank you.

01:10:02.519 --> 01:10:04.002
This is great.
