WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:07.666
That was the catalog we did for the exhibition.

00:07.906 --> 00:09.468
I'm going to write it down.

00:09.488 --> 00:11.870
Just take that one.

00:11.890 --> 00:12.610
Oh, that's great.

00:12.971 --> 00:13.391
Thank you.

00:14.312 --> 00:17.454
That tells in the beginning a little bit of what I've been telling you.

00:19.156 --> 00:22.539
Well, let me tell you, this is some collection.

00:23.059 --> 00:32.367
It's an unusual collection in that it combines aspects of a private collection with

00:32.920 --> 00:35.102
a bookseller's expertise.

00:36.323 --> 00:39.707
The problem with many private collections is the collector.

00:39.747 --> 00:40.788
They don't know anything.

00:41.088 --> 00:47.855
I mean, booksellers know a lot more about rare books than collectors do.

00:47.875 --> 00:53.240
And this has always been treated by me as sort of my collection, so I'm very fussy about it.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.223
I mean, books are in fabulous condition.

00:56.283 --> 00:59.025
I'm quite stingy.

00:59.086 --> 01:01.628
I won't ever pay for it.

01:01.928 --> 01:08.117
But over 30 years, we've found a lot of stuff, and this is absolutely beautiful.

01:08.137 --> 01:09.660
Do you mind if I give him a call?

01:10.261 --> 01:11.442
Oh, no, he'll love it, sure.

01:11.643 --> 01:13.546
And I'll explain this.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.348
How would I get in touch with him?

01:15.368 --> 01:17.171
I'll give you his phone number.

01:17.471 --> 01:18.172
He'll give me him a call.

01:18.373 --> 01:19.374
Come on, this is nice.

01:21.798 --> 01:26.205
How do we spell Chai's name?

01:26.225 --> 01:26.485
W-A-C-H-S.

01:33.822 --> 01:41.209
The thing is, I haven't heard of this collection since—that was just—I just got into the Gorgia Club last year, so I missed this by eight years.

01:41.229 --> 01:44.513
Well, I mean, I don't know if Jared goes very often, but you might run into it.

01:44.533 --> 01:47.516
Yeah, but I mean, I would have probably seen the exhibition, too, you know?

01:47.536 --> 01:54.323
Well, it was done for the January Disney Graphical Society Week.

01:54.523 --> 01:56.865
Okay, and we just went to this 97 one.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.649
Yeah, I think it was 95.

02:00.869 --> 02:02.151
Yeah.

02:02.231 --> 02:03.492
And that's his—

02:03.978 --> 02:07.343
And that's his lawyer.

02:07.363 --> 02:08.505
496-0005.

02:09.546 --> 02:13.211
Yeah, you could definitely call.

02:13.231 --> 02:13.892
Yeah, no problem.

02:14.093 --> 02:17.317
You could talk about, you know.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.801
I mean, it's a stunning call.

02:19.821 --> 02:22.525
I mean, this is worth a million pounds now.

02:22.545 --> 02:25.910
And does he take pride in it as a... He'll talk to him.

02:25.970 --> 02:26.691
He sure does.

02:26.711 --> 02:29.815
I mean, he's more keen on it now than on it.

02:29.835 --> 02:30.897
Because he knows what it is.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.235
Do you think he's keen on it because of the value aspect of it?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.597
Or do you think he has a sense of... No, actually.

02:37.718 --> 02:45.545
I think the value... Any collector who tells you he's not interested in the value is either the dupe of Devonshire.

02:45.625 --> 02:49.309
He doesn't focus on the real world or his lie.

02:49.329 --> 02:52.332
I mean, now, of course you're interested in the value.

02:53.152 --> 02:55.254
Well, it shows that you're not stupid, too.

02:55.274 --> 02:57.036
I mean, it shows that you haven't wasted your money.

02:57.817 --> 02:57.917
Yeah.

02:57.937 --> 02:59.078
I mean, I...

03:01.977 --> 03:04.661
Generally speaking, money has come to do with it.

03:04.681 --> 03:05.782
It's not the whole thing.

03:06.062 --> 03:07.825
It's horrible.

03:07.845 --> 03:11.750
So you take a proprietary view to this collection?

03:12.110 --> 03:15.014
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

03:15.635 --> 03:18.959
And I've had other experiences like this.

03:18.979 --> 03:31.596
This is the most dramatic one, but to show you how one thing leads to another, one of Jerry's investment advisors.

03:31.863 --> 03:36.612
The guy sort of did real estate deals and so on.

03:36.632 --> 03:39.357
The kind of person who takes doctors' money.

03:39.397 --> 03:47.571
Jerry's friend Marty saw his collection, and I got to know Marty.

03:48.613 --> 03:53.141
And Marty had a sort of collector's mentality and was definitely interested in money.

03:53.863 --> 03:56.267
But Marty's also no fool either.

03:56.483 --> 03:58.826
He was more educated.

03:58.886 --> 04:00.568
He got a degree in philosophy.

04:00.648 --> 04:03.171
He had a year at Oxford at studying philosophy.

04:03.191 --> 04:10.859
And now he's a sort of realer dealer in investment funds and so on.

04:12.181 --> 04:17.207
He said, you know, I want some philosophy books.

04:17.227 --> 04:24.415
So I started buying and selling things, Hume and John Locke.

04:25.778 --> 04:29.142
various things like that, and he began to build up a little collection.

04:30.704 --> 04:39.194
He wasn't quite as fanatic about it, but he began to get more interested.

04:41.717 --> 04:48.485
At one point he was in the office, and he's also very interested in Jewish stuff.

04:48.665 --> 04:55.633
He's involved in Israel and politics, anything Jewish.

04:57.301 --> 05:09.153
He saw on the shelf, I had a row of books by Voltaire, which was then of developing interest in my, from a sort of book collecting.

05:09.173 --> 05:10.435
It was a graphical standpoint.

05:11.676 --> 05:21.626
And it was a title of a book, Attacking Voltaire, but it had something about the Jews in the title.

05:21.646 --> 05:22.627
He said, what's that?

05:22.807 --> 05:26.211
And I explained to him that it was part of his Voltaire collection.

05:26.731 --> 05:30.517
Voltaire being sort of a philosopher.

05:30.537 --> 05:33.080
That was somebody he knew about.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.282
And he said, what are you doing?

05:34.302 --> 05:44.638
And I said, you know, I'm just buying Voltaire now because I think this is really interesting and booksellers don't know about Voltaire because it's too complicated.

05:44.658 --> 05:47.742
And so he said, well, sell that book to me.

05:47.782 --> 05:48.884
I said, no, I'm not going to sell it.

05:48.904 --> 05:49.805
It's part of the collection.

05:49.865 --> 05:55.033
I said, if you want it, you have to buy it all the collection, which wasn't that big at the time that

05:55.739 --> 06:06.055
He mulled it over for a while as the collection was getting bigger and finally said, okay, I'll take the Voltaire collection.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.137
So I sold him the whole thing.

06:07.157 --> 06:08.359
I said, you can buy it.

06:08.539 --> 06:11.063
On one condition, you let me keep going.

06:12.586 --> 06:21.460
Well, that was about eight years ago, I says, and it's gotten big now.

06:21.760 --> 06:27.886
Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot, but mostly Voltaire, but it's 400 titles now.

06:27.906 --> 06:30.047
So you get to collect for yourself, really.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.350
Yeah, he's just a custodian.

06:32.890 --> 06:37.774
But he said, he's making a lot of money now.

06:38.395 --> 06:44.380
So that aspect of it doesn't bother him, but he said, you know, I don't have room for Voltaire anymore.

06:45.882 --> 06:51.767
So we're in the process now of trying to negotiate the sale of this collection on block.

06:52.220 --> 06:57.968
to the New York Public Library because Leclerc, who took over there, is a Voltaire scholar.

06:57.988 --> 06:58.529
He went to St.

06:58.549 --> 07:01.052
Petersburg just to see Voltaire's library.

07:01.072 --> 07:01.893
That's right.

07:01.913 --> 07:09.143
Paul has discovered that the New York Public Library's Voltaire holdings are embarrassing.

07:09.504 --> 07:13.509
For some reason, their 18th century French holdings are minimal.

07:13.589 --> 07:15.352
They have nothing.

07:15.372 --> 07:17.755
So I think this is working now.

07:18.562 --> 07:22.448
He and Marty are now working out the tax consequences and so on.

07:22.508 --> 07:28.618
But sometime this year, with any block, this collection will be transferred into the New York public.

07:28.638 --> 07:32.464
And then Marty will have a lot of money to spend on philosophy books.

07:32.664 --> 07:34.327
Is Marty somebody I know?

07:34.447 --> 07:41.498
Maybe you're assuming that Tony right now?

07:41.613 --> 07:46.180
Because this deal is in the works, I think I won't get you involved with him.

07:46.381 --> 07:47.082
Jerry will do.

07:47.723 --> 07:48.644
Okay, good.

07:48.664 --> 07:52.611
Well, when the thing is classified, I'll find out about it anyway.

07:52.631 --> 07:55.095
Yeah, let's keep your fingers crossed.

07:55.115 --> 07:59.682
I think it is going to happen, actually, because Leclerc said, it's just a sort of mummy.

08:00.524 --> 08:05.612
But the deal is, and I hope they stick to it, is that

08:05.997 --> 08:10.643
New York Public can only have that collection if they let me keep going on it.

08:10.863 --> 08:21.256
But you're going to keep building it even after... Well, LeClerc says that he has, you know, money is tight around the New York Public and he's trying to raise money.

08:21.436 --> 08:27.824
That's a problem for suddenly buying a collection, especially his own particular subject.

08:27.925 --> 08:31.389
I think he feels a little leery about doing that.

08:31.409 --> 08:33.912
But he has some discretionary funds that

08:34.060 --> 08:35.302
as the president.

08:35.342 --> 08:39.448
So I said, it doesn't have to be a lot of money, just keep me interested.

08:39.489 --> 08:45.578
So he said he could find $25,000 a year to add to the collection.

08:45.598 --> 08:49.645
I said, great.

08:49.685 --> 08:52.108
But the rule is that I have to buy the books.

08:52.189 --> 08:54.112
Just don't you buy them.

08:54.172 --> 08:54.933
Let me do it.

08:55.754 --> 08:58.819
And so...

08:59.238 --> 09:03.843
I mean, I said, you can stop this arrangement any time you want, obviously, if you don't like it.

09:03.863 --> 09:05.105
It's not a contract.

09:05.225 --> 09:08.288
But, you know, just a gentleman's agreement.

09:08.308 --> 09:09.289
Let's see how it goes.

09:09.329 --> 09:10.511
Let me keep going on it.

09:11.031 --> 09:16.397
But you're certainly happy to see the collection is going to stay together as a collection.

09:18.740 --> 09:19.941
Yeah, kind of.

09:20.001 --> 09:21.243
I don't even care that much.

09:21.423 --> 09:24.286
But how about the poetry collection?

09:24.306 --> 09:25.127
That'll be sold.

09:26.474 --> 09:27.215
some day.

09:27.455 --> 09:29.758
I mean, we've talked about that actually.

09:29.918 --> 09:38.268
I mean, Gary doesn't really... He says, I mean, he's in the process of a divorce now.

09:38.288 --> 09:44.255
Unfortunately, his wife doesn't... She doesn't want to split the collection up.

09:44.275 --> 09:47.860
So what they've agreed is that the collection will stay intact.

09:49.101 --> 09:51.724
If it's ever sold, she will own half of them.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.789
But they say now, both of them, that

09:56.039 --> 09:57.862
it'll go to the children.

09:59.324 --> 10:07.015
I think that's probably... A couple of his kids say they're interested, and may actually be interested, but... They'll sell it.

10:07.035 --> 10:09.318
They'll sell it, because the taxes will be too much.

10:09.378 --> 10:15.967
You know, if they suddenly have to write a check for half a million dollars, estate tax, they'll sell it.

10:16.088 --> 10:18.591
And they have to like books, too.

10:18.611 --> 10:22.076
Well, I can see his son sort of is interested.

10:22.096 --> 10:24.139
He might like it, but...

10:24.845 --> 10:26.848
But a million dollars might be more interesting.

10:27.288 --> 10:30.273
Yeah, and by that time, you know, it can be many millions.

10:30.293 --> 10:30.793
I don't know.

10:31.815 --> 10:33.117
I suspect it'll be sold.

10:33.137 --> 10:41.829
I hope it will be sold by another bookseller, not just thrown into an auction.

10:41.849 --> 10:49.039
But, you know, I probably won't be around until I can.

10:49.059 --> 10:53.485
I mean, I spent some auction of butchers

10:53.887 --> 10:57.192
the way they do my collections now anyway.

10:57.212 --> 11:05.924
I'm not a great fan of the auction catalogs.

11:05.944 --> 11:08.948
But I don't mind that it's dispersed.

11:09.148 --> 11:10.250
It's catalogued.

11:10.270 --> 11:18.761
I mean, one of the things I've done with these collections, I mean, every book in Jerry's collection is fully catalogued by me.

11:19.623 --> 11:21.345
And we keep a file very quick.

11:22.422 --> 11:35.423
For the Voltaire collection, because the interest there was very much bibliographical as well as intellectual, I've done these very complicated descriptions of them.

11:35.623 --> 11:45.780
There's a sheet for every book in the Voltaire collection with very complete collations and so on.

11:48.865 --> 11:56.956
And one of the things I said to Luke Burke when I was first talking to him about this is that this, you know, I thought this was interesting to do.

11:57.076 --> 12:02.563
And he looked at what I'd been doing and I think was quite impressed by that.

12:02.583 --> 12:06.848
You know, this was not just a casual selection.

12:09.272 --> 12:12.696
I think that's where we put a lot of ground.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.719
Have you heard of a guy around London, Jack Lundzer?

12:15.739 --> 12:19.002
Have you ever heard of a collector of them that's collecting all this Jewish stuff?

12:19.022 --> 12:19.683
Lundzer.

12:19.743 --> 12:20.183
Lundzer.

12:20.203 --> 12:23.666
Lundzer, no big diamond, African.

12:23.686 --> 12:25.868
He's supposed to have a war.

12:25.948 --> 12:28.911
He's got like his own museum here at London.

12:28.931 --> 12:29.511
Lundzer.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.533
W-N-Z-E-R.

12:31.553 --> 12:39.480
The only one from the diamond business I know as a collector is Harry Oppenheimer.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.161
He's got a great collection.

12:40.181 --> 12:41.502
Did you have to go to South Africa for that?

12:41.920 --> 12:45.185
So this collection is just kind of Jewish, Hebraica.

12:45.546 --> 12:49.893
Yeah, because that's not a subject I've ever done anything with.

12:51.716 --> 12:52.998
So, you know, I could easily not.

12:53.018 --> 12:57.446
I think it's very, very quiet, mysterious, reclusive.

12:57.466 --> 12:59.349
Oh, right.

12:59.369 --> 13:03.476
It has like his own museum right here in London.

13:03.496 --> 13:04.377
Well, it's possible.

13:05.058 --> 13:06.701
Do you ever collect anything?

13:06.721 --> 13:07.422
Oh, yeah.

13:07.688 --> 13:08.854
What do you think?

13:08.914 --> 13:11.627
What I mean, certainly.

13:11.687 --> 13:14.661
But the books that support my...
