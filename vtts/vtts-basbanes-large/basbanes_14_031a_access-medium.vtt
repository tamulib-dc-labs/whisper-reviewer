00:04.250 --> 00:34.189
okay where oh great picture okay we are in oh this is magnificent hold this honey i don't know where we should begin uh these bookshelves the design the regular sketches are made by the really these were for the altieri archive you see there is sort of uh

00:34.692 --> 00:40.017
They are in the, actually, you know, call of arms.

00:42.459 --> 00:50.466
So they belong to Hope, and I don't know what they mean now.

00:50.846 --> 00:52.888
These are all... In the 19th century, I think.

00:53.148 --> 00:53.428
17th century?

00:53.448 --> 00:58.513
Yes, and they moved in here in... I don't know why I'm after it.

00:58.533 --> 01:04.378
Because these were done by... One of them, Camillo Massimo, he was the author.

01:04.763 --> 01:28.172
and there is a painting made by Maratta, Carlo Maratta is famous century painter and another famous painting is made by Velázquez of him and he was a big collection of everything from Roman coins to

01:29.468 --> 01:31.070
books and paintings.

01:31.410 --> 01:33.712
I know that he was... And he... Yes.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.995
He commissioned the paintings from Toussaint.

01:36.315 --> 01:47.526
Toussaint, the last... Do you have anything by him or is it... Yes, we have... No, now they were divided but we have about six or seven paintings by Toussaint.

01:47.546 --> 01:59.138
And he designed... He was... He could draw very well and apparently he...

01:59.607 --> 02:04.652
He helped Poussin or Uvelazquez.

02:04.972 --> 02:06.373
He drew with him.

02:06.914 --> 02:07.354
I know.

02:07.394 --> 02:11.298
He drew with him at Poussin.

02:11.338 --> 02:13.319
He had a big collection of classical.

02:14.180 --> 02:16.542
So this man, again, what is his name?

02:17.103 --> 02:18.464
Camillo Massimo.

02:20.786 --> 02:24.489
It's usually spelled Massimi.

02:25.350 --> 02:29.614
Yes, because in the ancient time Massimi came from the Latin.

02:29.999 --> 02:33.943
was referred to the whole family.

02:35.164 --> 02:39.008
Massimi and Massimo is the same in the modern times.

02:41.131 --> 02:51.041
And he's the designer of... No, this is made by Bernini and he commissioned to Bernini this library and the Palazzo Altieri.

02:51.521 --> 02:57.728
He draws some of the pieces of the Palazzo Altieri which is near here.

02:57.748 --> 02:59.770
But why were they moved here?

03:00.830 --> 03:15.712
I think the Altieri sold them, I don't know exactly, maybe after the death of the Pope, or maybe because there was a marriage between Altieri and Massimo, I remember now.

03:15.832 --> 03:19.197
Can you give me a date of when this was, about when?

03:19.377 --> 03:19.778
Bookshelf?

03:19.798 --> 03:20.138
Yes.

03:21.603 --> 03:22.424
Approximately?

03:22.444 --> 03:25.629
1600 and I don't know, 50.

03:25.649 --> 03:27.752
1600 something.

03:27.772 --> 03:28.333
16.

03:28.493 --> 03:30.116
Bernini is 1600.

03:30.356 --> 03:30.576
Yes.

03:30.596 --> 03:33.921
Not the beginning of 1600, maybe.

03:37.226 --> 03:49.905
So there is a lot of papers also for this cardinal here, and there are, for example, autographs, well, autographs, letters by Caravaggio,

03:50.138 --> 03:59.669
by Poussin saying that I give Cardinal Camillo Massimi these paintings and so on.

04:01.091 --> 04:04.895
Signed by Caravaggio, Poussin, Velázquez.

04:05.296 --> 04:15.167
We have autographs by King of Spain and various kings.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.232
These are basically the family archives?

04:18.292 --> 04:22.558
Is this what we would call... How would you describe the papers that are in here?

04:23.079 --> 04:33.836
Everything which had to do with the family, so things... For example, this is one of the indexes.

04:36.560 --> 04:44.192
You can find a lot of... ...castles which were...

04:44.948 --> 04:51.696
sold or which came to the family.

04:52.316 --> 04:52.957
This is a lot.

04:59.725 --> 05:07.293
This is all the famous and other things related to this palace, Palazzo delle Colonne.

05:07.834 --> 05:10.137
Palazzo di Pirro is the other one here.

05:10.437 --> 05:10.717
That's OK.

05:10.737 --> 05:13.360
You point to where you started.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.922
This is the palace.

05:16.252 --> 05:19.956
which is the other one.

05:19.976 --> 05:29.166
This one is a very big palace with a huge villa like Villa Borghese, Villa Doria, which belonged to Sisto Quinto, the Pope of Peretti.

05:29.266 --> 05:30.927
What's the name of this?

05:30.947 --> 05:36.273
This was called Villa Massimo alle Terme di Dio Cleziano.

05:36.293 --> 05:42.900
And it was originally the villa of the Pope Sisto Quinto,

05:44.804 --> 06:09.748
he was a Popperetti was his family name and then came into our family this villa and for example it belonged to what's called the Villa Palombara Palombara is the title of the Savelli family which now doesn't exist anymore it's a very old Roman family and we have the archive of the Savelli too because they were

06:10.184 --> 06:14.369
The last Savelli married Massimo in the 18th century.

06:14.409 --> 06:17.233
How do we spell that name?

06:17.574 --> 06:18.174
Savelli.

06:18.194 --> 06:18.555
S-A-V-E-W-L-I.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.499
And this is part of the Savelli archive.

06:22.400 --> 06:30.210
Savelli is a very old Roman family and they lived in this beautiful palace in... Theatro di Marcello.

06:30.450 --> 06:34.135
It was first Palazzo Savelli and then Palazzo Orsini.

06:34.155 --> 06:35.797
Are they living there now, Orsini?

06:35.957 --> 06:36.878
Orsini, yes.

06:36.898 --> 06:38.941
They're living there.

06:39.061 --> 06:39.502
Yes.

06:39.522 --> 06:39.702
And...

06:40.492 --> 06:42.816
It is still called Monte Cavello.

06:45.240 --> 06:52.673
So tell me what a scholar would learn if he or she came in and started going through the archives.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.938
What kinds of things would we learn about the Massimores?

06:55.958 --> 06:58.403
What kind of researches are coming here in a way?

06:58.543 --> 07:03.411
These are, for example, the last people.

07:04.285 --> 07:07.690
For example, they looked for this statue of Tirro.

07:07.710 --> 07:12.297
Virro was the king of Epilus in the ancient times.

07:12.317 --> 07:17.945
And she probably looked for documents when this statue was found.

07:18.265 --> 07:21.630
And it was in this other palace, which is called Palazzo di Virro.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.673
This one, it belongs to the familiar one.

07:24.454 --> 07:30.763
And now it is in the Campidoglio, the collections of Rome.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.706
It was a huge statue of Virro.

07:33.293 --> 07:36.377
Which is Mars?

07:36.397 --> 07:38.439
No, Pyrrho was the king of the Pyrrhus.

07:38.940 --> 07:44.346
Yes, but I read something about the Confucian, so people thought it was Pyrrho.

07:44.426 --> 07:45.747
They thought it was, yes.

07:45.928 --> 07:47.830
And then perhaps Mars.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.312
Well, they didn't know it.

07:49.372 --> 07:59.183
Maybe it's Mars, but on his, how do you say, lorica, the coat, yes, the armor.

07:59.602 --> 08:08.252
He had some elephants, so they thought it was Peter, because he came with the elephants to Rome, to invade the Italy of Rome.

08:08.473 --> 08:12.137
So this is the formal name, the Archivo Hassa Massimo.

08:12.678 --> 08:16.222
That is the formal name of the Hassa Massimo.

08:16.242 --> 08:17.704
Yeah, excellent, most excellent.

08:17.724 --> 08:18.725
Excellent piece, yeah.

08:18.745 --> 08:19.966
Okay, let's do the whole thing.

08:19.986 --> 08:24.472
This is not the whole, this is just the index.

08:24.492 --> 08:25.253
I understand.

08:25.273 --> 08:27.195
By the subject.

08:29.032 --> 08:38.946
For example, this is various feudi lands and castles.

08:39.868 --> 08:55.410
And here we have other... Here you can find it, for example,

08:57.078 --> 09:03.243
Here you have all the dates.

09:03.664 --> 09:18.196
And if you want to look for Cardinal Massimo, for example, Poussene and things like this, just go into here and look for Cardinal Massimo, Caffe, Poussene.

09:18.797 --> 09:22.680
What is the date of this calligraphy here, would you suggest?

09:23.041 --> 09:25.903
Well, the old archive was

09:27.233 --> 09:33.240
Yes, during the Sacco di Roma in 1527.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.824
So it was still in here.

09:37.486 --> 09:40.269
This palace belonged to the family.

09:40.790 --> 09:54.226
We don't know for how long, but there are papers in various archives which came to the year 1000 or 10th century.

09:54.246 --> 09:55.688
10th century.

09:56.174 --> 10:00.701
From the 10th century, but maybe earlier.

10:00.741 --> 10:10.075
We don't know exactly, because all the older Cai was burned by the troops of Carlo Quinto, Charles XV.

10:10.275 --> 10:16.765
Everything was burned in 1527, and we have some earlier papers, but not a lot.

10:16.897 --> 10:23.445
So these dates from the 16th century, early 1500, up to now.

10:23.545 --> 10:29.432
So very early the family realized how important it was to record its history, to keep its archives.

10:29.772 --> 10:33.197
Yes, but everybody was doing this.

10:33.357 --> 10:43.909
Because every payment, every whatever, I don't know, you were buying a statue, or Poussin came with a painting.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.853
We had, for example, these autographs by him, or by Caravaggio.

10:47.069 --> 10:54.278
I, Michelangelo Melisi, will give this painting too.

10:55.479 --> 10:59.785
Like a deed or a receipt or contracts.

10:59.945 --> 11:01.547
We call them contracts, I guess.

11:01.847 --> 11:02.868
Well, it's not really a contract.

11:02.888 --> 11:06.292
Yeah, but you can find a lot of things.

11:06.312 --> 11:11.659
From payment made to tailor, to armor.

11:11.791 --> 11:19.806
Well, you can determine the kinds of clothes they had, what kind of cutlery they had, what kinds of furnishings they had for the house.

11:19.826 --> 11:22.291
Yes, we don't have just payment.

11:22.792 --> 11:30.306
Then you can find all the letters from, for example, Gabriel Massimo to Caravaggio or to the King of Spain.

11:30.742 --> 11:33.226
from Cristina Lisbethia for example.

11:33.246 --> 11:35.048
Can we see some of this?

11:35.108 --> 11:51.872
There are some letters between Cristina Lisbethia and Massimo because when she came here to Rome there was the famous Cagliostro, a magician.

11:51.852 --> 12:05.748
And they organized in Palazzo Colonna some experiments with Cristina Ligretia, with Massimo and Calliostro, they were three or four.

12:05.848 --> 12:08.030
Because I know she was involved in alchemy.

12:08.330 --> 12:09.832
Exactly, it was all alchemy.

12:09.872 --> 12:13.676
Calliostro was a big alchemist, very well known.

12:14.938 --> 12:16.600
We just have to find some.

12:16.620 --> 12:21.285
Okay, I think for my purposes it would be very good if we could have some specific items like

12:21.839 --> 12:31.131
the kind of item you just suggested, if you have a letter to Queen Christina, if you have something to Caravaggio, this would be the kind of material that would be very useful.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.314
Caravaggio and all this stuff is not in here.

12:33.534 --> 12:38.520
It's closed in another... That makes sense, yeah.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.184
...of the past, but now we can't see.

12:41.244 --> 12:45.709
But it's also important, first, if you could tell me some of the things.

12:45.749 --> 12:46.811
We have a letter to Caravaggio.

12:46.831 --> 12:47.972
I can tell you maybe something else.

12:50.075 --> 12:51.677
The first...

12:52.653 --> 12:56.719
book which were printed in Rome.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.642
It was printed in here.

12:59.082 --> 12:59.423
Really?

12:59.743 --> 13:01.386
The first press?

13:01.446 --> 13:03.208
No, no, no.

13:03.529 --> 13:11.180
In this room here, we don't know exactly where, but it was the first... The first printing press in Rome was in this building.

13:11.941 --> 13:13.623
The first one was in Germany, no?

13:13.643 --> 13:21.715
Yes, and my... No, no, first in Germany, and then two people who worked with Gutenberg,

13:21.965 --> 13:24.388
They were called Schweinheim and Tannas.

13:24.549 --> 13:35.163
They came to Subiaco and then they were brought here and they found the Mechinate in one of the masses.

13:35.183 --> 13:37.847
And for example this was printed here.

13:38.047 --> 13:43.195
So this is still the old binding.

13:43.215 --> 13:44.597
Yeah, I've got to take a picture of that.

13:45.117 --> 13:48.462
It's forty hundred and...

13:48.661 --> 13:49.302
1497.

13:49.362 --> 13:55.109
Can you just open it a little bit so we can see some of the printed pages?

13:55.530 --> 13:59.555
Wait, I'll show you the last page because it was written in print.

13:59.575 --> 14:01.918
Do you have the colorblind page there too?

14:01.979 --> 14:02.199
Yes.

14:04.622 --> 14:05.223
I think, yes.

14:05.824 --> 14:07.566
Well, we have a lot of these.

14:07.706 --> 14:18.280
It's very famous.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.670
The binding is original, too.

14:21.790 --> 14:22.011
Yes.

14:22.431 --> 14:26.897
Which one is that?

14:27.017 --> 14:29.900
It is 1497, but they began here in 1470, 57.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.844
14?

14:34.125 --> 14:34.946
They began here?

14:35.006 --> 14:39.952
I'm not sure exactly.

14:39.972 --> 14:40.793
Now we'll see it.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.535
They began in 1457?

14:42.735 --> 14:42.976
Well, yeah.

14:42.996 --> 14:43.216
1460?

14:43.396 --> 14:45.659
Yeah, 1460, yeah.

14:45.679 --> 14:47.181
1460, question mark.

14:47.501 --> 14:48.402
Wrong.

14:48.635 --> 14:49.556
Look at the cat.

14:50.817 --> 14:53.540
That's a different one.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.201
He's guiding.

14:55.242 --> 14:57.925
So, tell me, what is this book, the title of this book?

14:57.945 --> 14:58.906
Arctic Knight.

14:59.126 --> 14:59.686
Arctic Knight.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.069
But I see this is... Attic?

15:02.109 --> 15:02.890
No, wait.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.132
No, this is printed in Venice.

15:05.152 --> 15:05.272
Yeah.

15:05.853 --> 15:06.754
It's not this other one.

15:06.814 --> 15:07.735
It's Venice.

15:07.755 --> 15:08.255
This one.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.839
But we have... I mean, we have a lot of these.

15:11.859 --> 15:12.720
This is another one.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.123
This is Herodoto, the history.

15:15.203 --> 15:16.384
That's Herodotus' history.

15:16.404 --> 15:17.545
This is made in...

15:17.744 --> 15:19.106
In Rome, 1475.

15:19.386 --> 15:19.987
Let me see.

15:21.989 --> 15:22.971
By Panac.

15:22.991 --> 15:25.634
And these are printed in here.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.718
These are the first, these are the very first printers in Italy.

15:28.738 --> 15:38.150
You're holding, basically, Subiaco, they printed about seven different... This book, yes, this book to Italy is what Gutenberg is to Germany.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.393
These are the first printers in Italy.

15:41.268 --> 15:42.249
That's what we're holding.

15:42.269 --> 15:43.330
That excites me.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.011
Yeah.

15:44.031 --> 15:48.235
And here you can see all these books printed here in it.

15:48.255 --> 15:49.877
I mean, the first ones printed in Rome.

15:50.378 --> 15:51.579
Let's get the first one page.

15:51.599 --> 15:55.243
Impressus Rome in domo nobilis viri petri de maximis.

15:56.284 --> 15:56.704
In here.

15:57.825 --> 15:58.066
1475.

15:58.206 --> 15:58.286
Wow.

15:58.306 --> 15:58.446
Wow.

15:58.466 --> 16:02.410
Let me write that down.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.853
And the sixth is the fourth.

16:05.974 --> 16:08.777
So it's Pietro e Massimo.

16:09.753 --> 16:39.473
you find always maximi because it came from the latin the maximis so maximis is the plural but when do you think this book certainly is not a contemporary binding this is a much later binding so this is not in a library someplace outside of this did they have a formal library that that looks like a very formal binding yes no this is not very well i mean it is old but not as this one what i'm saying is did you keep the books in a formal library

16:40.094 --> 17:08.903
yes they were together with the archive but not in here they were in another room it's a flat actually it's very big on the other side and we have all the frescoes with the press with the Scheinheim and Pannert printing books there are all these frescoes like this one with books so this has to be restored and so now it is moved because we are doing some restorations and this is a

17:09.862 --> 17:14.827
temporary place for, yes, location for the archive.

17:14.847 --> 17:19.572
You mentioned when we chatted on the phone that you were putting some of this on the web?

17:20.113 --> 17:20.373
Yeah.

17:20.934 --> 17:22.636
My idea was the following.

17:24.218 --> 17:27.641
So I wanted to talk to, well, you told me I could talk to you.

17:28.302 --> 17:39.514
The idea was putting all these indexes of the archives, not just of our archives, but some other Roman archives, in, for example, a CD-ROM, doing a

17:40.253 --> 17:50.644
searchable index, and selling it to everybody who has to study something in archives.

17:51.084 --> 17:52.366
Yes, for example.

17:52.406 --> 17:59.193
We have a lot of requests from the United States to send photographs of certain documents and of this and that.

17:59.213 --> 18:05.960
So it would be maybe very useful to everybody who studies archives or other things.

18:06.801 --> 18:10.024
Not just historians, because you can find here

18:10.932 --> 18:15.197
who did various dresses.

18:15.217 --> 18:18.100
You can find a lot of things.

18:18.421 --> 18:21.725
From what they ate to what they wore.

18:21.745 --> 18:22.986
Many people would be interested in it.

18:23.006 --> 18:26.150
That's social history, that's very important.

18:26.170 --> 18:29.454
She had heard a lot of things.

18:31.256 --> 18:34.780
Do you have an archivist who is cataloging it for you?

18:35.063 --> 18:36.525
It is all catalogued.

18:37.125 --> 18:40.269
This is one of the indexes.

18:40.609 --> 18:43.793
And there we have other four books of indexes.

18:46.436 --> 18:50.321
We have seven.

18:50.621 --> 19:00.312
And there you can find, for example, papers of the Cardinale Camillo Massimo, 1620 to 1670.

19:00.511 --> 19:29.016
or papers of Cristina Lisvezia and maybe we find... I think there was something... So you can see, these are very old bindings, we have... Or this book... For example this was...

19:29.603 --> 19:36.570
the daughter of the king of Saxony, who married a Massimo in the 1800s.

19:36.590 --> 19:45.038
These are, for example, papers of Princess Cristina of Saxony, where Massimo was she.

19:45.058 --> 19:49.702
Married a Massimo from the year 1870 to 1827, then all the others.

19:50.423 --> 19:54.227
And so you can find, and everything is in these indexes over there.

19:54.947 --> 19:57.670
But there, you can find it in, you know,

19:58.004 --> 20:04.791
letter of Cristina Uzvezia to Camillo Massi, for example.

20:04.811 --> 20:13.981
So, putting all these indexes on the archive, it's very interesting for a lot of people, so they know exactly what they can find in the archive.

20:14.001 --> 20:23.792
If you are studying Cristina Uzvezia or Poussin, you know that here you can find a lot of things about Poussin.

20:24.042 --> 20:32.554
putting just not our archive, but some other archives on the same CD-ROM, for example, just the indexes, because you can't put all these things in just one CD-ROM.

20:32.834 --> 20:38.402
Then you have a powerful tool to study history and then whatever.

20:38.803 --> 20:40.946
So we have, for example, the Savelli family in here.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.791
There are some other friends of mine that want to do these things.

20:44.811 --> 20:52.682
So we will have all the Scalchi family, Colonna, Serlupli, Crescenzi, Teodoli.

20:52.747 --> 20:56.492
And there will be a lot of... Tell me what these are.

20:56.552 --> 20:58.675
These are the records that are indexed here?

20:58.695 --> 21:05.143
These are records of, for example, Rocca Secca is a feudo, so land and castles.

21:05.163 --> 21:11.692
And so you can see altri feudi, other lands, Rocca Secca.

21:11.812 --> 21:16.678
So how does Rocca Secca, how does that... Rocca Secca is a town in Lazio.

21:17.536 --> 21:20.119
So there was a family home there?

21:21.181 --> 21:22.383
It was a family castle.

21:22.403 --> 21:23.424
A family castle.

21:23.764 --> 21:24.746
Castle and land.

21:25.507 --> 21:28.311
This is another castle, Castello di Montefortino.

21:29.212 --> 21:32.576
So this is everything which is this Montefortino, Montefortino.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.540
How many castles do you have?

21:35.560 --> 21:36.622
Well, there were quite a lot.

21:38.424 --> 21:41.749
Nowadays, not very much.

21:41.769 --> 21:44.312
But we have two or three castles.

21:44.332 --> 21:44.893
Three castles.

21:45.211 --> 21:53.222
But at that time there were approximately a quarter of Lazium belong to Massimo.

21:53.242 --> 21:54.264
One quarter of where?

21:54.404 --> 21:57.809
About, of Lazium, of the region around Rome.

21:58.069 --> 22:01.314
Well, a lot, there was a lot.

22:02.616 --> 22:14.172
In the year 1600, when there was this sacco di Roma, Pietro Massimo was the rich of many Rome.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.771
At that time they had a lot of things.

22:17.051 --> 22:23.820
1642 to 1853, that one book catalogs, indexes everything that happens?

22:23.840 --> 22:25.442
Well, but just in Tivoli.

22:25.522 --> 22:26.844
Just in Tivoli.

22:26.944 --> 22:32.010
When you rent something.

22:32.030 --> 22:35.354
So houses rented and land rented.

22:35.374 --> 22:40.281
So it's just things belonging to rentals of land.

22:40.301 --> 22:40.421
Okay.

22:42.804 --> 22:43.585
Extraordinary.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.374
And so, where are the three castles now?

22:47.734 --> 22:48.755
You said there are three in the family.

22:48.775 --> 22:50.056
There is one, Arsoli.

22:50.997 --> 22:52.899
How do we spell that?

22:53.360 --> 22:56.602
A-R-R-S-O-L-I.

22:56.623 --> 22:58.264
And the other two are?

22:59.145 --> 23:00.286
They are all in the Lazium.

23:00.306 --> 23:08.774
They don't belong to the Massimo family, but to people related to us very closely.

23:08.934 --> 23:09.114
Yes.

23:09.134 --> 23:11.076
So they don't... Other branches of the family.

23:11.156 --> 23:11.997
Yes, yes.

23:12.277 --> 23:13.538
So what's the other...

23:13.973 --> 23:14.794
Two places.

23:14.814 --> 23:30.678
The one is called San... Oh, San... San... I think the design of the lock, it repeats.

23:30.698 --> 23:33.583
Yes, this is always beautiful.

23:34.885 --> 23:36.046
You should just take a photo of it.

23:36.487 --> 23:36.607
Next.

23:37.468 --> 23:38.250
It's beautiful.

23:38.730 --> 23:39.291
San Girolamo.

23:39.311 --> 23:39.812
San Girolamo.

23:40.298 --> 23:41.800
Girolamo.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.763
Girolamo, yes.

23:44.783 --> 23:45.904
San Girolamo.

23:47.786 --> 23:48.607
These are seals.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.030
Is that seals?

23:51.230 --> 23:54.154
Yes, in there there is something.

23:54.354 --> 23:56.336
You should take a photo.

23:56.356 --> 23:58.378
These are maybe of popes.

23:58.398 --> 23:59.600
They had this bolle.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.243
Oh, my God.

24:02.323 --> 24:05.506
So do you have any, you must have cardinals in the family.

24:05.526 --> 24:07.909
Do you have any popes in the family?

24:08.159 --> 24:13.765
I brought you around this book.

24:13.825 --> 24:14.065
Okay.

24:14.085 --> 24:16.588
This was done in the 18th century.

24:18.750 --> 24:23.836
On the family history, historical families.

24:23.856 --> 24:26.959
This is about Massimo.

24:26.979 --> 24:32.285
About two books.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.548
And... Look at the seal.

24:35.688 --> 24:36.609
Is this the seal?

24:37.090 --> 24:37.390
Yeah.

24:38.686 --> 24:42.611
But there is a better one in the... Okay, I want to get this way to go.

24:44.053 --> 24:50.382
There is a beautiful one of the 16th century on the scene, just in the entrance.

24:54.167 --> 24:58.393
They said there were two popes before the year 1000.

24:58.914 --> 24:59.514
Two popes?

25:00.336 --> 25:01.337
Can we name them?

25:01.697 --> 25:07.225
And there is the famous Panvino, which was a famous...

25:08.217 --> 25:15.328
He was a historian and he studied all the... Historical writer?

25:15.769 --> 25:16.430
Yes, writer.

25:16.891 --> 25:21.838
And he wrote a lot of books about historical things.

25:21.858 --> 25:25.424
And he wrote one book about the history of the Massimo family.

25:25.945 --> 25:32.716
And he had demonstrated that... Well, we say the Massimo family is the oldest in Italy.

25:32.976 --> 25:34.258
So we say in the whole world.

25:34.424 --> 25:38.150
Yeah, because Rome was very old.

25:38.290 --> 25:39.572
Yes, that's the beginning.

25:39.933 --> 25:52.553
So all our family descended from the family Fabia, which was the family of Quinto Fabio Massimo, was the Roman general who defeated Hannibal, who saved Rome.

25:52.753 --> 25:57.882
Yes, that's what you say, and that's what got lost at 1527, the proof for that.

25:57.902 --> 25:59.925
No, no, no.

26:00.243 --> 26:00.884
Sorry?

26:00.904 --> 26:03.267
The name of the general who defeated Hannibal?

26:03.287 --> 26:04.688
Quinto Fabio Massimo.

26:05.009 --> 26:12.778
Well, who saved Rome, so he was given the title of pater patrie, so father of the country.

26:13.419 --> 26:15.562
But are you really sure?

26:15.602 --> 26:16.623
Are you sure about that?

26:17.244 --> 26:17.424
Yes.

26:17.464 --> 26:18.025
How sure?

26:18.405 --> 26:19.026
No, no, no.

26:19.046 --> 26:21.349
It was then proved by Panvino.

26:21.629 --> 26:24.973
And we have these books in the Vatican, too.

26:24.993 --> 26:25.934
There are these manuscripts.

26:26.135 --> 26:27.376
It was never published.

26:27.636 --> 26:29.018
We have just manuscripts of him.

26:29.420 --> 26:35.971
And he could show, he's shown until the year... This is the genealogy here.

26:35.991 --> 26:40.318
Yes, but until the year... I wish you could get a picture of the genealogy.

26:42.281 --> 26:43.844
Until the 10th century.

26:44.264 --> 26:45.326
No, this is just one.

26:45.346 --> 26:46.648
I know.

26:46.668 --> 26:47.149
Very great.

26:47.169 --> 26:48.692
This is old, you know.

26:48.712 --> 26:51.176
Maybe you can fold it up a little bit.

26:51.196 --> 26:51.276
Yes.

26:51.296 --> 26:55.022
So this Panavino, he never published that book, is that right?

26:55.441 --> 26:58.664
No, there are just manuscripts.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.127
The Vatican Library has another one.

27:01.287 --> 27:07.613
Van Vigne was a genius writer and he studied all these sort of things.

27:07.953 --> 27:09.255
And he published a lot of things.

27:09.955 --> 27:15.181
Books about Latium and... You should have it published.

27:15.521 --> 27:17.503
I'm going to take a picture of it.

27:17.523 --> 27:19.184
The history of your own family, I mean.

27:19.204 --> 27:24.790
And for example, Tito Livio, the famous historian,

27:25.141 --> 27:36.211
Talking about Quinto Fabio Massimo, he said that the Gens Fabia, so the family Fabia, said the Gens Fabia De Inde Maximorum Ditta.

27:36.492 --> 27:41.797
So after he saved Rome, was called Massimo.

27:42.617 --> 27:44.759
Ah, so that's the... Quinto Fito Livio.

27:45.140 --> 27:47.262
Can you tell me the names of the popes, though?

27:47.282 --> 27:53.848
Yeah, I'll have to... It was... Wait, one was, I think, Pasquale.

27:54.267 --> 28:04.182
This is excellent.

28:04.443 --> 28:10.092
And the other one was Canacleto.

28:10.112 --> 28:12.455
Canacleto, I don't know which one.

28:12.475 --> 28:16.201
Fasquale and Anacleto should be the two both.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.810
That's good, this is excellent.

28:21.925 --> 28:29.917
And the Quinto Fabio Massimo, so the Gens Fabia, was one of the patrician families in Rome, was very, very important.

28:30.517 --> 28:38.329
And they were, they found Rome, fondato, were at the foundation of Rome.

28:38.829 --> 28:42.895
So we say that our family is about 2,700 years old.

28:44.438 --> 28:50.987
And the Gens Fabia, so the family Fabia, was, they said they came from Hercules, Hercules.

28:51.322 --> 29:02.095
So we have all frescoes with the foundation of Rome, Hercules, we have tapestries with Hercules, statues, all things you can always find.

29:02.115 --> 29:10.144
And here in the entrance, on the top, you have a beautiful coat of arms made by Peruzzi or Giulio Romano.

29:10.985 --> 29:19.675
And there is Hercules with two snakes, because when he was a child he...

29:20.279 --> 29:22.242
Hercules, the Greek?

29:22.262 --> 29:22.823
Sorry?

29:22.843 --> 29:23.344
Hercules?

29:23.504 --> 29:24.065
Hercules, yes.

29:24.085 --> 29:25.246
Hercules?

29:25.266 --> 29:26.288
Oh, my God.

29:26.548 --> 29:29.132
And holding our coat of arms is here.

29:29.232 --> 29:32.297
So your family is ultimately descended from Hercules.

29:32.477 --> 29:33.418
Exactly.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.420
That's the point.

29:35.061 --> 29:37.945
It's much better than books I've read so far.

29:38.145 --> 29:41.370
Let me ask you, how important are the... Now, your name is Fabrizio.

29:41.530 --> 29:41.711
Yes.

29:41.731 --> 29:42.652
Who are you named for?

29:42.672 --> 29:48.200
There is plenty of Fabrizio Matthew.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.041
Two thousand years.

29:49.061 --> 29:49.442
Wow.

29:50.013 --> 29:53.576
It is overwhelming.

29:53.596 --> 29:54.957
Tell me the names of your parents.

29:55.238 --> 29:57.800
So who are you really?

29:57.960 --> 29:58.521
In the family?

29:58.541 --> 30:00.082
I guess that's what I'm driving at.

30:00.122 --> 30:13.454
Well, I'm the oldest of the... In Roman families, you have just the oldest of the... The oldest man who has the title.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.436
So Massimo are princes.

30:16.157 --> 30:18.138
My father is the Prince Massimo.

30:18.599 --> 30:18.979
You are not.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.020
You will be.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.440
I will be because I'm the oldest.

30:22.560 --> 30:31.194
And I have another name, which is Brancaccio, and Brancaccio is another very old family, but of the south of Napoli and Sicily.

30:31.494 --> 30:45.737
They were vicere di Napoli, vicere king of Naples, and it was another family which is very old, before the year 1000, they came with Carlo Magno,

30:46.190 --> 30:47.532
How do you spell your other name?

30:47.752 --> 30:48.714
Brancaccio.

30:48.734 --> 30:50.076
Maybe when did you write it down?

30:50.276 --> 30:50.757
Much more complicated.

30:50.777 --> 30:53.641
Brancaccio is these other two castles.

30:53.882 --> 31:01.994
Other castles were... Okay, so the Brancaccio owns... Brancaccio is another... Princess Brancaccio.

31:02.034 --> 31:05.279
Does that have anything to do with the modern Palazzo Brancaccio?

31:05.299 --> 31:07.522
Yes, that's of the family.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.806
Here in the city, which is like a museum for something?

31:09.826 --> 31:11.047
Yes, for Oriental Art.

31:11.488 --> 31:14.152
Okay, so they own it, but they rent it to the museum.

31:14.573 --> 31:15.454
It's rented, yes.

31:15.704 --> 31:30.555
So we would describe you as Fabrizio Massimo, the son of Prince Massimo, right?

31:30.575 --> 31:30.835
Yes.

31:31.316 --> 31:36.447
And does he use a first name or just Prince?

31:36.933 --> 31:44.101
Of course everybody has a first name, but formally my father is the Prince Massimo.

31:44.822 --> 31:47.885
That is how we would refer to him in an article.

31:50.167 --> 31:52.790
Fabrizio Massimo Brancaccio.

31:52.910 --> 31:58.436
I am the Prince Massimo Brancaccio.

31:58.717 --> 31:58.997
You are?

31:59.437 --> 32:00.058
Yes.

32:00.078 --> 32:02.721
My father is the Prince Massimo and the Prince Massimo Brancaccio.

32:03.477 --> 32:05.018
No, I don't get it anymore.

32:05.159 --> 32:10.383
Because Brancaccio was given to me because the family Brancaccio has no more hairs.

32:10.844 --> 32:14.407
Okay, so you are a prince, but you are the Prince Massimo Brancaccio.

32:14.748 --> 32:15.048
Yeah.

32:15.068 --> 32:15.308
Right.

32:15.408 --> 32:17.110
But you're not the Prince Massimo.

32:17.130 --> 32:17.490
I will be.

32:17.891 --> 32:18.671
You will be.

32:18.691 --> 32:20.153
But I can't even split the two things.

32:20.533 --> 32:20.853
Sure.

32:20.873 --> 32:27.139
Because the last king of Italy, before he died, he gave me all the titles of the Brancaccio family.

32:27.159 --> 32:30.603
Because my grand... The other one.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.265
The mother of my grandmother was Brancaccio.

32:33.447 --> 32:57.700
okay the last king what what did he last king of italy umberto the second yes well all the things related to aristocracy titles and things like this they they should belong to the king i mean if if somebody uh if the family ends then all these titles they go back to the car and then he's free to to redistribute them so he can

32:58.439 --> 33:00.982
if you have the right on some titles.

33:01.303 --> 33:05.388
So he gave me all the titles of the Brancaccio, because there were no more herons.

33:05.468 --> 33:07.871
So your uncle who gave you these titles once again?

33:07.911 --> 33:18.265
The King of Italy, the last King of Italy, which was my uncle, because my grandmother was the first cousin of the King, Savoia.

33:19.326 --> 33:22.049
When did the last King die?

33:23.291 --> 33:27.957
About 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 1980,

33:28.612 --> 33:32.457
I don't know the exact date, it's about 15 years ago.

33:32.477 --> 33:38.485
So you're not only a prince then, you're like a Duke and several other titles as well?

33:38.505 --> 33:40.068
Yes, yes.

33:40.708 --> 33:43.352
Tell us some, tell us some.

33:43.372 --> 33:50.121
So, my father is the Prince of Atsoli.

33:50.381 --> 33:52.224
Atsoli is this castle we still have.

33:52.424 --> 33:55.969
A-R-S-O-L-I.

33:56.573 --> 34:00.537
Why don't you write them down?

34:00.697 --> 34:01.958
Oh, there is.

34:02.318 --> 34:02.679
A-R-S-O-L-I.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.801
A-R-S-O-L-I.

34:06.963 --> 34:09.685
Why don't you keep it?

34:11.246 --> 34:12.968
Well, we have a lot.

34:13.509 --> 34:20.535
Allora, Principe.

34:20.555 --> 34:22.056
I am Principe di Roviano.

34:22.377 --> 34:24.859
Roviano is his other castle which was Massimo and then

34:25.447 --> 34:32.556
went to Brancaccio because they married him.

34:32.576 --> 34:38.603
So this is my father, this is me.

34:39.063 --> 34:43.268
I'm Duca di Lustre.

34:44.890 --> 34:46.192
This is my son.

34:46.212 --> 34:50.577
Marchese di Montescaglioso.

34:50.597 --> 34:51.438
That's you.

34:51.458 --> 34:54.402
That's all me.

34:54.422 --> 34:54.542
Ah.

34:54.910 --> 34:57.834
I forgot, Principe again, the Bridge of Yano.

34:59.736 --> 35:04.061
This is me.

35:04.081 --> 35:08.987
And then some other titles, small titles, it's like Nobile of this, Nobile di Napoli.

35:09.228 --> 35:12.552
But really, you know, you're... My father has other titles.

35:12.572 --> 35:16.597
Yes, but the... Principe di of Yano.

35:16.617 --> 35:20.501
In fact, it means much more to be Musmo than all those titles, right?

35:21.142 --> 35:23.365
Yes, so the only title is

35:23.564 --> 35:28.510
and Principe Massimo, so the title of Prince on the surname.

35:29.271 --> 35:30.252
This is another title.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.735
So like you have the Principe Colonna, it's just one.

35:32.995 --> 35:33.956
Principe de Scalchi.

35:34.537 --> 35:37.300
So this is 25, that's 29, 24.

35:37.701 --> 35:41.485
What are the significance of these numbers on the bookcases?

35:41.505 --> 35:42.547
You can find them in here.

35:42.647 --> 35:52.018
You have to look for a paper, and in there it's written Armadio, 25, shelf 4,

35:52.370 --> 35:55.153
number 167.

35:57.556 --> 36:14.715
There are a lot more in the in the flat over there where the archive has always been but now it moved so we have lots of in here because there were more than 30 29 there are some others

36:15.016 --> 36:17.440
Tell us a little bit briefly about what was on the ceiling.

36:17.480 --> 36:27.217
I see a tantalizing fragment of... Yeah, we don't know because it has to be restored and it will come out.

36:27.278 --> 36:29.802
Is it underneath the plaster?

36:29.950 --> 36:30.891
Yes, yes.

36:30.911 --> 36:31.212
Oh my goodness.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.394
That's underneath.

36:32.414 --> 36:33.035
So it's been painted over?

36:33.055 --> 36:33.475
Yes, it's underneath.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.599
So if you restore, you think the picture will emerge?

36:35.639 --> 36:36.340
Yes, of course.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.241
Well, that has.

36:37.261 --> 36:37.782
You see that.

36:37.802 --> 36:39.485
This was done recently.

36:39.565 --> 36:51.142
This, August 6th century, it was made, all this, by the school of Raffaello, Giulio Romano, Pierin del Vaga, Aldassare Peruzzi, Daniele da Volterra.

36:52.825 --> 36:57.031
And these bookcases, all of these bookcases were made by that... Bernini.

36:57.232 --> 36:58.033
Bernini.

36:58.435 --> 37:01.559
Well, not made, but designed.

37:01.599 --> 37:16.940
And we found the designs of this, many of these faces, and the old, they are in, I don't know, in Windsor Castle or in Paris, I don't remember where, maybe the original drone is.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.442
What do you call this room?

37:18.462 --> 37:20.344
Do you have a name for this room that we're in here?

37:20.605 --> 37:25.591
No, now it is... What do you think it originally was?

37:25.631 --> 37:28.375
What was the purpose of this room when it was first...

37:30.498 --> 37:35.747
a function I guess.

37:35.767 --> 37:39.854
I'm just thinking for when I'm writing this story how we would describe it.

37:39.874 --> 37:41.517
Where are we in the building?

37:41.657 --> 37:46.366
This is the Patel, let's say.

37:46.967 --> 37:48.950
It's just on the right of the entrance.

37:49.932 --> 37:53.518
About here there are all the big rooms

37:54.022 --> 37:59.652
With, again, all these frescoes with the foundation of Rome, stories of Hercules.

37:59.792 --> 38:04.100
Now, I understand once a year you... Tatuies, all above us.

38:04.481 --> 38:05.703
Can we see some of these things?

38:06.805 --> 38:07.826
No, it's not possible.

38:07.867 --> 38:12.655
But I can show you some frescoes which are on the portico up here.

38:12.675 --> 38:14.899
Whatever you can show us would be greatly appreciated.

38:15.183 --> 38:18.988
And then secondly, I understand once a year you open the house up on the Saints Day.

38:19.008 --> 38:20.490
Could you tell us a little bit about that?

38:20.650 --> 38:22.533
This is the 16th of March.

38:22.913 --> 38:24.736
Yes, I was there.

38:24.756 --> 38:25.457
The 16th of March?

38:25.477 --> 38:27.259
Yes, yes.

38:27.279 --> 38:28.220
The 16th of March.

38:28.721 --> 38:32.806
And it was because of San Filippo Neri, so this saint.

38:32.826 --> 38:33.027
What?

38:33.287 --> 38:34.609
San Filippo Neri.

38:34.629 --> 38:35.670
San Filippo Neri.

38:36.551 --> 38:38.194
I'm going to write the album down.

38:38.274 --> 38:41.117
Now we'll find it.

38:41.137 --> 38:44.582
And he worked with Massimo, Paolo Massimo, who died.

38:45.203 --> 38:52.231
and the father and all the family at that time was very, was in friendship with the San Filipponelli.

38:52.591 --> 39:01.241
So for example in this church now, in this chapel you saw, we have a lot of reliquie.

39:01.682 --> 39:03.043
Relicaries.

39:03.263 --> 39:03.904
Relicaries.

39:05.025 --> 39:06.447
Not the relicaries.

39:07.228 --> 39:08.629
Relicaries where you keep the relics.

39:08.649 --> 39:09.330
Yes, no, no, no.

39:09.510 --> 39:12.454
The things you keep in the relicaries of San Filipponelli.

39:12.474 --> 39:13.675
We have a very

39:14.110 --> 39:19.357
The strange thing is, for example, we have the... How do you call it?

39:19.898 --> 39:21.240
Spectacles?

39:21.380 --> 39:23.382
Yes, exactly, of San Filippo Neri.

39:24.824 --> 39:31.293
You have the spectacles of... We have a lot of things of San Filippo Neri, because it was very friendly.

39:31.313 --> 39:34.097
Here you see a Fabrizio of the 16th century.

39:34.117 --> 39:37.441
Fabrizio is always... Pietro, Fabrizio, Fabrizio, Pietro, Camillo.

39:38.263 --> 39:42.328
I read that he was living out in your... Paolo Massimo.

39:42.848 --> 39:53.120
He was born in 1569 and his birth was predicted by San Filippo Neri because he had five daughters.

39:53.441 --> 39:58.447
The father was Fabrizio Massimo.

39:59.648 --> 40:02.171
He had a lot of daughters.

40:03.673 --> 40:06.797
He had about twenty sons.

40:07.385 --> 40:09.568
Nineteen dollars and one.

40:09.588 --> 40:12.171
And the birth of the son was predicted by San Filippo Neri.

40:12.392 --> 40:17.559
For example, San Filippo Neri told him to buy arzoli, which we still own.

40:19.121 --> 40:23.927
And he told him to sell this, buy this, and... To sell, buy what was it again?

40:24.087 --> 40:25.409
He told you to buy what?

40:26.090 --> 40:32.178
He told him, Fabrizio, to buy, you know, lands, castles, or sell these castles.

40:32.198 --> 40:36.784
So Filippo Neri was an advisor to... Exactly, because they were so very...

40:37.034 --> 40:45.667
So he told us, asked Fabrizio Massimo at that time in the 16th century, to buy the castle of Arcelino all the land around, which we still own.

40:47.409 --> 40:48.511
So it was a good advice.

40:50.013 --> 41:03.733
And there is a prediction about our family he made, and he said that the Massimo family will always have a male hearse, so it will never end.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.845
And they will always have bread, so they'll always have something to eat.

41:08.865 --> 41:09.586
We won't starve.

41:09.766 --> 41:12.168
But sometimes it takes 19 daughters to do it.

41:12.769 --> 41:15.311
Yes, but the 20th wasn't the right one.

41:16.553 --> 41:18.995
No, it wasn't the right one because he died.

41:19.576 --> 41:20.617
And he had another one.

41:21.097 --> 41:27.564
No, because he had first five daughters, then Paolo, which died, and then the other Pietro, Giambattista.

41:27.584 --> 41:32.809
And so names of the family is always Fabrizio, Pietro, Camillo,

41:33.380 --> 41:38.245
So Fabrizio, and then the son was Pietro, and then the son was Fabrizio again, Fabrizio Camillo.

41:38.485 --> 41:58.487
And we have one thing, that every first, I mean, when the new Prince Massio, let's say, even if it is, as soon as one is born, he gets the name Camillo.

41:58.867 --> 41:59.488
The first one.

42:00.262 --> 42:01.343
Yes, just the first one.

42:01.623 --> 42:05.947
So you see Camillo the 4th, Camillo the 5th, there's always just one.

42:06.468 --> 42:10.171
As soon as you... For every generation there is one.

42:10.211 --> 42:14.735
And then they were called, for example, in the Bartesimo, Meri Fabrizio Pietro.

42:16.017 --> 42:18.139
So there is Camillo... I'm, for example, Camillo the 18th.

42:19.240 --> 42:26.486
But why... Because it was... There was... Legato.

42:26.506 --> 42:27.027
Legato.

42:27.567 --> 42:28.328
Legato.

42:28.595 --> 42:31.339
Well, the first one had to be Camillo.

42:31.399 --> 42:31.659
Yes.

42:32.060 --> 42:35.845
And from... But Fabrizio, was that the second name?

42:36.345 --> 42:36.525
No.

42:37.367 --> 42:39.409
This name was before the baptism.

42:39.650 --> 42:43.895
So as soon as you were born and you were the future prince, you were Camillo.

42:44.596 --> 42:50.784
So this was Camillo IV, this was... So your name is Camillo XVIII?

42:51.265 --> 42:52.507
No, my name is Fabrizio.

42:52.867 --> 42:55.851
But I am also...

42:56.033 --> 42:57.895
Camillo, 18.

42:58.195 --> 42:59.477
18.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.940
Like, for example, in France.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.703
Before you got your name, you were... Yes, exactly.

43:04.823 --> 43:05.664
Now, do you have children?

43:06.345 --> 43:06.545
No.

43:06.866 --> 43:10.610
So, when you have a son, that son will be Camillo the 19th?

43:10.670 --> 43:11.431
The 19th, yes.

43:13.353 --> 43:16.336
Now we are beginning to understand.

43:16.356 --> 43:16.457
Okay.

43:16.497 --> 43:17.478
Like the king of France.

43:17.638 --> 43:21.923
And he will be Camillo the 19th even before he's baptized.

43:22.003 --> 43:22.584
Exactly.

43:23.565 --> 43:25.467
And when you're baptized, you will be...

43:25.868 --> 43:31.153
Giovanni, Fabrizio, Pietro, or Camillo, if you like the name Camillo.

43:31.173 --> 43:32.635
May I ask you how old you are?

43:32.755 --> 43:34.356
Yes, 34.

43:38.921 --> 43:39.762
You live here in Rome?

43:41.083 --> 43:41.924
Yes.

43:41.944 --> 43:43.245
You live in this village?

43:43.265 --> 43:47.810
I live between Rome and the country, and it's a little bit complicated.

43:48.270 --> 43:48.891
It's still rough.

43:49.291 --> 43:50.172
I'm always around.

43:50.512 --> 43:55.217
But I live here and in the countryside, near Rome, not in Arsoli.

43:56.007 --> 43:56.828
Very natural.

43:57.870 --> 43:59.432
Why have they crossed some of them?

44:00.854 --> 44:01.996
Is there any significance to that?

44:02.016 --> 44:04.280
Yes, maybe these are the paintings.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.482
I don't know exactly.

44:05.522 --> 44:11.851
I think it's the paintings we still have of.

44:11.871 --> 44:12.052
Of those.

44:12.072 --> 44:12.352
I think, yeah.

44:12.372 --> 44:12.733
Interesting.

44:13.153 --> 44:19.483
So San Filippo then, this Paolo Massimo died, and San Filippo brought him again to life.

44:20.105 --> 44:21.066
He brought him to life.

44:21.146 --> 44:22.568
Yes, it was a miracle.

44:22.869 --> 44:25.312
And he was... Here in this building?

44:25.432 --> 44:47.901
Yes, in this building, and the room of Paolo Massimo, where the miracle happened, is now chapel, and then it was given the privileges of church, which I don't know what it means, but... And so once you're here to honor this saint, on his day, you open up the... Yes, every day, from every 16th of March, from the year 1583,

44:49.012 --> 44:59.423
It is opened and we have masses being set all day long, well, in the morning.

45:00.104 --> 45:08.073
And we have cardinals and a lot of other priests who come to see mass.

45:08.093 --> 45:13.639
How many other archives do you think there are like this in Rome?

45:13.659 --> 45:14.680
Do you think this is unique?

45:14.760 --> 45:16.282
Do you think there's anything else like this?

45:16.502 --> 45:16.883
No, no, no.

45:16.903 --> 45:17.844
There are a lot.

45:17.864 --> 45:18.985
Like this.

45:19.235 --> 45:20.637
What other families do you think?

45:20.657 --> 45:21.738
Not that I want to see them.

45:21.758 --> 45:22.620
Yes, yes, yes.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.262
No, no, there's no problem.

45:24.402 --> 45:25.383
There are a lot of families.

45:26.365 --> 45:33.254
The Vatican has... No, no, the Vatican has a lot of archives belonging to Roman families.

45:33.274 --> 45:36.879
Because they gave them to keep it.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.044
Like the Borghese archive is in the Vatican.

45:41.265 --> 45:43.408
Do they still have the Palazzo Borghese?

45:43.428 --> 45:44.169
Yes.

45:46.152 --> 45:46.432
They do?

45:46.452 --> 45:49.056
But they lost the museum, the villa.

45:49.508 --> 45:51.671
Yes, yes, it was.

45:51.691 --> 45:53.153
A little scandal then.

45:53.253 --> 45:54.756
Yes, a lot of people lost.

45:54.996 --> 45:58.201
We lost our villa of the Sisto Quinto Cosi.

45:58.541 --> 46:01.806
Now there is the Stazione Termini on it.

46:01.826 --> 46:04.049
It was expropriated.

46:04.269 --> 46:05.491
Did you get any money for it?

46:05.511 --> 46:06.232
No, hardly.

46:07.174 --> 46:13.763
It was in 19th century, before Italy.

46:14.284 --> 46:15.145
Right.

46:17.858 --> 46:27.208
Okay, so San Filippo Neri became saint from this miracle too.

46:27.528 --> 46:32.514
He did a lot of miracles, but this was the most famous.

46:33.875 --> 46:39.061
He died, Paolo, and then... Yeah, he died, woke up, and then he died again?

46:39.481 --> 46:45.908
Yes, because Paolo Massimo wanted to talk to San Filippo Neri because he was ill.

46:46.394 --> 46:52.441
And he couldn't get in time to see him still alive, so he began to pray.

46:52.681 --> 46:54.523
And then Paulo Massimo woke up again.

46:55.424 --> 47:01.812
They talked a little bit, and then he asked if he wanted to go back, because the mother of him already died.

47:02.713 --> 47:07.859
And he said, no, I want to go to my mother, so I want to die again.

47:07.879 --> 47:13.405
So he died again.

47:13.425 --> 47:14.106
Quite a story.

47:15.200 --> 47:21.048
He wanted to see his mother and one of his daughters.

47:21.689 --> 47:26.235
And it's all written here in the archive.

47:26.276 --> 47:28.619
This is the genealogy, right, this book that you're holding?

47:28.639 --> 47:28.939
A piece.

47:28.959 --> 47:32.424
This goes to the year 1000 or shortly before the year 1000.

47:32.444 --> 47:34.828
You showed us a couple of incunabula.

47:35.228 --> 47:37.311
Do you have a lot of incunabula here?

47:37.471 --> 47:37.852
Yes.

47:38.252 --> 47:38.993
No, no, we have.

47:39.033 --> 47:40.836
These are elsewhere in the house, right?

47:40.956 --> 47:41.697
Yes, yes.

47:42.118 --> 47:44.481
I wanted to show you this...

47:45.608 --> 47:48.652
signatures of Caravaggio or something else.

47:48.673 --> 47:49.754
Yeah, that would be nice.

47:49.774 --> 47:51.877
They are not, because there is nobody in here now.

47:51.917 --> 48:01.071
They are closed in a couple, maybe on Monday, but I'm not sure, because we had some problems.

48:01.211 --> 48:01.792
Yeah, Monday.

48:01.832 --> 48:04.035
We were all on the countryside.

48:05.217 --> 48:12.948
Monday, I have appointments with the Vatican Library, but maybe in the afternoon, we can photograph them.

48:12.968 --> 48:13.209
Whatever.

48:13.289 --> 48:14.130
We'll see.

48:15.106 --> 48:16.207
It is not in here now.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.890
And we have, yes, some others in Cannaboli.

48:19.910 --> 48:20.631
And we have a lot.

48:20.651 --> 48:22.453
I mean, the library is not in here.

48:22.853 --> 48:23.994
We have lots of books.

48:24.815 --> 48:30.480
Because in the 19th century... Oh, look at that.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.561
Ah, this is lovely.

48:31.581 --> 48:32.222
Madras.

48:32.242 --> 48:33.603
Ah, this is the Cardinale.

48:34.384 --> 48:35.645
Oh, let's take a minute.

48:35.945 --> 48:37.927
They've made portraits of them?

48:37.947 --> 48:39.128
This is made by Marasta.

48:39.188 --> 48:41.570
This is the miracle of San Pedro.

48:41.590 --> 48:42.531
Oh, my goodness.

48:42.764 --> 48:45.226
You have to take a picture.

48:45.246 --> 48:46.568
Could you just hold it up?

48:46.668 --> 48:47.148
Excuse me.

48:47.228 --> 48:51.432
Did you want to take a picture, Nicole?

48:51.512 --> 48:59.300
I could just hold it up a little bit like this, so I can take a picture.

48:59.380 --> 48:59.840
Take one first.

48:59.860 --> 49:05.486
I'm going to get one back here with you in the picture, like this.

49:05.506 --> 49:11.992
Now I'm going to come a little closer and get one like this.

49:12.012 --> 49:12.332
Okay, thank you.

49:13.291 --> 49:15.334
And these are all family members.

49:15.434 --> 49:18.378
Are these portraits, original portraits, that were drawn in the book?

49:18.398 --> 49:20.140
These are famous portraits, yeah.

49:20.160 --> 49:23.004
This is of Sermoneta, 16th century.

49:23.886 --> 49:25.087
This is Sermoneta again.

49:25.227 --> 49:26.549
This is Maratta.

49:26.589 --> 49:31.416
Maratta was probably the most famous painter of the 17th century.

49:32.377 --> 49:34.140
Maratta did these paintings?

49:34.480 --> 49:37.665
Yes, a lot of paintings by Maratta.

49:37.685 --> 49:40.108
Because he was a mecenate, so he

49:40.713 --> 49:44.440
That's Cardinal Camillo Massimo.

49:45.982 --> 49:47.024
And what are his years?

49:47.084 --> 49:47.565
Are they there?

49:47.805 --> 49:48.988
No, Cardinal Camillo.

49:49.008 --> 49:49.228
Sorry?

49:49.589 --> 49:51.572
What are his years, the years that he lived?

49:52.754 --> 49:58.925
No, 1700, no, 1620.

50:00.548 --> 50:01.650
I'd love to get there.

50:01.670 --> 50:04.054
Beginning of the, let's say, 17th century.

50:04.405 --> 50:10.194
Okay, and this is Francesco Massimo, and what was his... He was in Castel Sant'Angelo.

50:10.355 --> 50:16.284
Castellano was the... not the owner of Castel Sant'Angelo, because it was of the Pope.

50:16.304 --> 50:22.194
It was the one who, let's say, like Gerard, who was in charge of Castel Sant'Angelo.

50:22.214 --> 50:23.816
And this is Angelo Massimo.

50:27.102 --> 50:27.703
Fascinating.

50:28.544 --> 50:29.826
And that's the miracle.

50:29.846 --> 50:30.407
It's the miracle.

50:30.467 --> 50:31.729
Here's San Filippo Neri.

50:32.468 --> 50:36.552
This is the room up on the second floor.

50:37.593 --> 50:38.554
Now it's all closed.

50:39.775 --> 50:42.138
And this is the Palazzo.

50:42.158 --> 50:45.501
And the room was subsequently turned into his chapel.

50:46.962 --> 51:01.817
He had huge collections of Roman coins, of statues, of

51:02.573 --> 51:05.958
You mentioned he was a collector of many things.

51:05.978 --> 51:21.740
Yeah, the Palazzo, now the Palazzo del Drago, which is in Via Quattro Fontane, a huge palazzo, was built by him, and, well, by him, was his palace, and there he had all these huge collections, which is a huge palace.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.222
And he filled it?

51:23.542 --> 51:24.944
It was full of things.

51:24.964 --> 51:26.246
Palazzo del Drago.

51:26.546 --> 51:27.928
Palazzo del Drago.

51:27.948 --> 51:28.509
Belonged to him.

51:29.230 --> 51:29.931
And he was...

51:30.248 --> 51:30.829
Camillo.

51:31.089 --> 51:31.769
Camillo.

51:32.350 --> 51:34.332
But you don't have that one anymore.

51:34.352 --> 51:35.013
What?

51:35.033 --> 51:35.393
Palace.

51:36.214 --> 51:37.495
No, no, it belongs to the Drago.

51:37.635 --> 51:48.306
Yes, after he died, he spent so much in art things that a lot of things had to do.

51:48.326 --> 51:52.650
But we still have... Are there any other portraits or just these pages?

51:52.670 --> 51:53.130
Oh, maybe yes.

51:54.131 --> 51:57.134
These are some of the things we have.

51:57.154 --> 51:58.095
These are the...

51:58.953 --> 52:06.204
of the 10th century, the old Massimo of the year 1900 or something, yes.

52:06.224 --> 52:11.211
Is that the 6th century?

52:15.597 --> 52:17.600
These were sculptures that were done?

52:17.761 --> 52:20.104
No, this is like this one.

52:20.124 --> 52:20.845
It's made of wood.

52:20.945 --> 52:21.746
Of wood, okay.

52:22.207 --> 52:22.828
Fresh cars.

52:22.908 --> 52:23.289
Is it a crest?

52:23.309 --> 52:23.509
No, no.

52:23.649 --> 52:24.150
A crest?

52:24.451 --> 52:26.133
No, I don't think you open it.

52:26.153 --> 52:26.894
Oh, just a chest.

52:27.054 --> 52:27.495
A chest.

52:27.515 --> 52:27.915
A chest.

52:28.116 --> 52:31.059
So these are the drawings of the chest, the plans or whatever.

52:31.099 --> 52:33.162
And you still have these chests.

52:33.182 --> 52:34.724
They're very ancient.

52:34.744 --> 52:36.106
Do these chests still exist?

52:36.146 --> 52:37.648
Yes, yes, we have them.

52:38.489 --> 52:39.870
And they're from what century again?

52:39.890 --> 52:40.751
16th century.

52:41.092 --> 52:46.739
You can see here these are all of them and this was the wife of him.

52:47.360 --> 52:48.461
They did it when they married.

52:48.982 --> 52:51.465
So it's all wood with gold.

52:52.026 --> 52:53.968
They are very precious because they are very old.

52:54.742 --> 52:58.406
And they are quite rare.

52:58.627 --> 53:05.975
By the way, it's looking a bit like a coffin, so I have to ask, where's your family church, family burial place?

53:06.035 --> 53:08.438
We have different, because the farm is very big.

53:08.899 --> 53:09.840
Yeah, here there is one.

53:10.841 --> 53:17.429
But in Arsoli we have a chapel.

53:18.190 --> 53:21.694
And there is in Laterano, in Trinità dei Monti,

53:21.995 --> 53:23.978
You raise an interesting point.

53:24.198 --> 53:25.259
You say you have a large family.

53:25.299 --> 53:27.602
How large is the family right now?

53:27.622 --> 53:28.103
Right now?

53:28.243 --> 53:28.403
Yes.

53:30.926 --> 53:46.065
Massimo family is not very large, but we have lots of... We're related to nearly all the... How do you say?

53:46.666 --> 53:47.327
No, no.

53:48.083 --> 53:52.229
like kings of France, Borbone, Savoia.

53:53.030 --> 53:57.998
I'm a descendant of the stewards, so kings of England.

53:58.018 --> 54:00.081
The stewards of England?

54:00.161 --> 54:00.782
The Windsors?

54:01.943 --> 54:03.606
No, stewards.

54:03.626 --> 54:04.607
The Windsors came late.

54:04.627 --> 54:05.609
The Windsors came late.

54:10.696 --> 54:15.323
So this was a guy with Cagliostro and 59th grade.

54:19.184 --> 54:24.089
No, maybe it was the... Calioso was the 18th century.

54:25.891 --> 54:32.257
Christiane-Sweze was the end of the 17th century, the end.

54:32.277 --> 54:34.379
This is Savoia again.

54:34.559 --> 54:35.320
Oh, that's so lovely.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.923
Before the unity of Italy.

54:38.083 --> 54:40.785
That's lovely.

54:41.827 --> 54:44.289
Has anyone written the history of your family?

54:44.309 --> 54:44.870
Yes.

54:44.890 --> 54:47.352
The unpublished book.

54:48.040 --> 54:51.844
And then published history by, what's his name again?

54:52.505 --> 54:53.726
Can you spell it?

54:54.087 --> 54:58.071
Can you spell it for us?

54:58.091 --> 54:59.673
It's very famous, Onofrio.

55:03.477 --> 55:04.418
Why isn't it published?

55:04.639 --> 55:06.220
Is it?

55:06.240 --> 55:06.801
I don't know.

55:06.821 --> 55:07.782
Is that at the Vatican?

55:07.802 --> 55:09.064
There's other books by Fandinho.

55:09.784 --> 55:13.428
But I'm surprised the family doesn't publish it.

55:13.449 --> 55:17.473
But because we have the...

55:18.348 --> 55:19.209
Oh, these are beautiful.

55:19.349 --> 55:20.730
These are like lithographs.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.113
Oh, I saw this.

55:23.133 --> 55:26.196
These are, sorry, but this is an old... That's the family castle?

55:26.797 --> 55:29.940
Yeah, now it seems a little... It's bigger.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.041
It's bigger now?

55:31.862 --> 55:33.303
No, it was bigger at the time.

55:33.323 --> 55:37.347
It's viewed from a strange point of view.

55:38.889 --> 55:44.895
For example, here there is a huge... It's a huge park.

55:46.968 --> 55:53.075
And we have even a garden in the Giardino Pensile.

55:53.095 --> 55:54.457
Sounds beautiful.

55:54.477 --> 55:55.999
Now you said you still own Pensile?

55:56.299 --> 55:56.760
Yes.

55:56.780 --> 55:57.861
You still have Pensile.

55:57.881 --> 55:59.623
And it's bigger than this now?

55:59.643 --> 56:01.285
These are the Theodi of the Messino Pensile.

56:01.305 --> 56:02.907
So I told you it was about a quarter of the last.

56:02.927 --> 56:03.468
It was huge.

56:03.688 --> 56:06.912
This is Rome here down in Napoli.

56:06.932 --> 56:07.953
Regno di Napoli.

56:07.973 --> 56:09.375
This was their property around Rome.

56:10.156 --> 56:12.179
They owned one quarter of the property around Rome.

56:12.199 --> 56:13.380
About and even on.

56:13.597 --> 56:22.832
So, what do you do now?

56:22.852 --> 56:25.256
Are you involved in agriculture in any way?

56:25.276 --> 56:26.098
Yes.

56:27.721 --> 56:29.023
Is there a family business?

56:31.607 --> 56:35.233
Well, the agricultural means.

56:35.737 --> 56:39.781
Well, I wouldn't call it a business.

56:39.982 --> 56:42.685
It's not a real business.

56:42.705 --> 56:43.566
What is it?

56:43.806 --> 56:46.209
We have a lot of land to steal.

56:46.689 --> 56:49.532
Do you rent it out to farmers?

56:49.913 --> 56:52.495
No, no, we calculate it.

56:52.676 --> 56:53.456
You calculate it?

56:53.477 --> 56:55.759
Yes, but it's not a real business.

56:56.059 --> 56:57.421
What kinds of things do you raise?

56:57.441 --> 57:03.027
Lots of olives and granules.

57:03.563 --> 57:05.765
And that again, is it Astley?

57:06.146 --> 57:07.367
Astley, Astley.

57:07.387 --> 57:15.736
We have other land around the world, not just that.

57:15.756 --> 57:15.856
Good.

57:15.876 --> 57:17.658
Anything to be missing?

57:17.678 --> 57:21.443
Oh, it's just if we could see some, you know, Queen Christine or something.

57:21.463 --> 57:25.527
Or is everything away in the close part?

57:25.747 --> 57:26.068
No, no, no.

57:26.088 --> 57:32.895
In the close part, we have all these autographs, like Caravaggio, things of Spain, of France, Hussein Velázquez.

57:33.297 --> 57:37.562
Here we have, maybe even on Christiane Isletia.

57:37.582 --> 57:43.088
We can find something here if you like, but we have to look in the other end.

57:43.108 --> 57:51.998
And the signatures that you would have here of Caravaggio and the Kings, it would be letters that were exchanged in the course of routine business, shall we say.

57:52.218 --> 57:53.059
For example, what?

57:53.079 --> 58:02.089
Because all these Matthews, they had some works in, well,

58:02.626 --> 58:06.630
It was not a work in Carichi.

58:06.971 --> 58:12.957
This Camillo Massimo, for example, he went to Spain.

58:12.998 --> 58:16.041
He was Archbishop in Spain.

58:17.302 --> 58:19.565
We are related to the kings of Spain.

58:19.585 --> 58:28.174
The wife of... It's not an uncle, Prozio.

58:28.234 --> 58:31.418
It was the uncle of my grandfather.

58:31.921 --> 58:42.980
He married one of the Borbone of Spain, and after Franco died, she was one of the possible heres to the throne.

58:43.360 --> 58:47.327
And then he went to Juan Carlos, and she was one of them.

58:47.347 --> 58:55.681
Then we are led to the Luigi, king of France, like Louis XIV, the son king.

58:57.384 --> 58:58.165
And so...

58:58.938 --> 59:09.013
And we have lots of letters of kings and of important persons because all this Massimo had some important things to do in politics.

59:09.133 --> 59:11.176
So there's correspondence with Louis XIV, you say?

59:11.236 --> 59:14.361
There's correspondence with... There are correspondences.

59:14.681 --> 59:21.612
I don't know now with who, but there is correspondence with nearly everybody in Europe.

59:21.632 --> 59:25.958
And we are descendants even from Borbone, so the king of Spain of...

59:26.545 --> 59:29.869
King of France and Savoia and all.

59:30.410 --> 59:35.977
You mentioned earlier that a lot of the other families have turned their archives over, say, to the Vatican.

59:36.097 --> 59:39.121
Is this something that you had considered or would consider at some point?

59:39.141 --> 59:44.127
No, it stays in the family in perpetuity, I would guess.

59:44.348 --> 59:47.432
That's why I wanted to do this.

59:47.452 --> 59:48.773
Maybe you need an archivist.

59:48.813 --> 59:51.256
Maybe it should be more secure than it is now?

59:51.277 --> 59:56.383
Yes, no, we have somebody who comes from time to time, but now we have to, again,

59:56.802 --> 01:00:05.415
I mean, maybe it needs a little professional attention in terms of security and stuff like that.

01:00:05.855 --> 01:00:06.256
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.200
It works.

01:00:09.661 --> 01:00:10.542
It works.

01:00:10.562 --> 01:00:12.065
It's invaluable.

01:00:12.085 --> 01:00:13.787
I mean, you can't, it's priceless.

01:00:13.807 --> 01:00:15.970
You could not replace these things.

01:00:16.892 --> 01:00:20.397
That's why I wanted to, I had this project, to put all the archives.

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:23.588
It's very difficult to put it on.

01:00:23.628 --> 01:00:24.690
Tell me about your project.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:25.592
Let's go again.

01:00:25.652 --> 01:00:26.835
You were mentioning the CD.

01:00:27.035 --> 01:00:31.344
Is this a project that you've actually begun or it's something that you're thinking about?

01:00:31.605 --> 01:00:32.467
I'm thinking about it.

01:00:32.707 --> 01:00:38.599
I already talked to other people who have archives and they want to do this.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.343
The idea is to do a

01:00:40.846 --> 01:01:10.785
for example cd-rom or even put it on the web or whatever but it's not not just your archives but also other other archives so if you have to find something you can do you have a website yes you have a website yeah so we can i can actually go to your website and see what's on there yes but now there is there is no archive right so it's massimo.it probably dot it for it yeah or mass yeah massimo dot it

01:01:11.592 --> 01:01:16.680
But there is nothing related to the family now, it's just some general stuff.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.425
What was your thinking in terms of Biblio?

01:01:19.445 --> 01:01:23.091
I mean, what would you want me to relay to Pauline's self?

01:01:24.293 --> 01:01:26.357
In terms of marketing, is that what you were interested in?

01:01:26.377 --> 01:01:27.539
Yeah, for example, yes.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:36.233
Because it would be interesting to know if there is a, I don't know, if you have an idea or if she has an idea,

01:01:36.415 --> 01:01:43.882
of who will buy this product, how many people, or if it can be sold even through the Biblio.

01:01:43.982 --> 01:01:44.862
I'm not so sure.

01:01:44.923 --> 01:01:50.307
I will certainly mention it to her, but I think that there may be other ways to look at that too.

01:01:50.327 --> 01:01:56.793
I mean, I think it certainly has a great scholarly interest that may not be reached by Biblio.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.675
Maybe there are other ways to reach this.

01:01:59.495 --> 01:02:00.797
It was just an idea.

01:02:01.057 --> 01:02:03.419
I think maybe I can give you some ideas on that.

01:02:03.639 --> 01:02:04.560
Yes, why not?

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.781
Let me think about it.

01:02:06.453 --> 01:02:17.952
My question was, if you or she is interested in a sort of collaboration, so we could see how to do it.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:23.862
Because it is quite difficult to digitize all these things.

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:31.735
You can still read what is written here and just type it on the computer.
