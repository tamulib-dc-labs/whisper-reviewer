00:02.393 --> 00:12.250
And I guess everybody wants to know how it is that you came to start writing books at this juncture of your tenure.

00:13.011 --> 00:18.741
Well, there's a myth that I started writing at the age of 70, and it's quite untrue, but it's a fairy story.

00:19.863 --> 00:25.212
I always worked all my life on and off to amuse myself.

00:25.462 --> 00:34.015
And it was only when I was in my 50s that my husband said to me, look, stop throwing things away and start getting published.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.140
And I did have a couple of children's books published.

00:38.682 --> 00:41.747
And then he died and I blocked for about five years.

00:42.668 --> 00:50.960
And then I wrote my first novel, which was shown to, I think, five or six publishers who refused it.

00:52.503 --> 00:54.726
And then I found Macmillan and they took it.

00:55.043 --> 01:01.053
So everybody thinks I wrote it when I was 70, and it had been written when I was young.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.577
We're fine, I'm just checking.

01:04.639 --> 01:07.544
You can just keep on, I'm just checking my tape.

01:07.564 --> 01:14.355
And they think I started writing at 70, which is not, as I say, true.

01:14.816 --> 01:21.827
It's something I've done on and off all my life as a therapist, because I enjoyed writing.

01:22.364 --> 01:26.590
When I had a husband and children and housed around, it came last.

01:28.472 --> 01:29.854
And I didn't have time.

01:30.395 --> 01:34.140
But then when I started getting published, I had more time.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.703
And since my husband died, I've got much more time.

01:37.664 --> 01:38.886
And he encouraged me a lot.

01:39.947 --> 01:44.293
And a writer friend of mine, Antonia White, encouraged me a lot.

01:44.313 --> 01:49.620
And so having had one novel published, my editor said it was

01:50.073 --> 01:51.134
got any other ideas.

01:51.214 --> 01:57.279
I said, yes, I'm halfway through another, so he said, please finish it, and that's what I got there.

01:57.299 --> 02:01.983
I didn't just start at the Serpentier.

02:02.003 --> 02:06.047
I just started getting published, and then I'm gradually getting known of that bit.

02:06.467 --> 02:12.773
Well, it's quite amazing.

02:12.793 --> 02:18.898
I think that it's not the circumstance of your beginning to publish at the Angel Seminary, but the quality of the work.

02:19.705 --> 02:26.972
But I think, you know, by the time you're married, you've had so much experience in life, which is the fifth truth.

02:26.992 --> 02:31.957
Yeah, but writing is not something everybody is able to do, however.

02:31.977 --> 02:36.201
No, but an awful lot of people try, and a lot of people write who can't write.

02:36.762 --> 02:38.464
Isn't that the truth?

02:38.484 --> 02:44.970
I think probably most, all my life when I was writing for my own pleasure, I was teaching myself to write.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.433
And evolving my own style.

02:47.933 --> 02:55.624
And your style is charming and engaging, but you seem to think a lot about your characters.

02:55.644 --> 02:58.729
I mean, it's not just writing to write a good sentence.

02:58.749 --> 03:05.739
You really love doing some very sophisticated character development.

03:05.999 --> 03:08.783
I know I'm quite good at dialogue.

03:09.364 --> 03:11.447
I listen a lot to people.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.685
I'm in an awkward situation now.

03:15.146 --> 03:29.225
I have people watching me and listening to me, but I've spent most of my life of a fly on the wall listening to other people and watching other people and paying attention, especially to the language that changes for the whole time.

03:29.285 --> 03:37.336
The use of English is changing from year to year, month to month almost.

03:37.456 --> 03:41.822
And there are some words that I never would use, but I know they're going to be out of passion anymore.

03:42.005 --> 03:46.713
Six months, some expressions have become popular.

03:47.194 --> 03:52.363
Do you see what you do as a form of social comedy at all, as someone suggested?

03:52.543 --> 03:56.510
I only write about people I think I know, who amuse me.

03:57.732 --> 04:01.498
I love the hypocrisy of people.

04:01.782 --> 04:02.783
conversation.

04:02.963 --> 04:04.786
They say one thing and they mean another.

04:04.806 --> 04:05.527
I love that.

04:06.007 --> 04:08.270
Well, you say you write about people you think you know.

04:08.310 --> 04:13.596
Do you think that these people who think they know you see themselves in your book?

04:13.656 --> 04:14.517
No, I don't.

04:14.537 --> 04:17.661
And I don't write about real people who I have known.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.905
I wouldn't do that or I wouldn't have any friends.

04:22.447 --> 04:31.738
I invent people and I know or think I know people's moods and attitudes, social attitudes,

04:32.832 --> 04:40.304
and the hypocrisy of thinking, which amuses me very much.

04:40.324 --> 04:41.045
But I enjoy it.

04:41.746 --> 04:47.955
But now, as I say, I'm finding it quite embarrassing to be listened to and watched myself.

04:47.975 --> 04:50.499
Right now, what is that?

04:50.640 --> 04:52.943
Well, I'm naturally rather a shy person.

04:53.003 --> 04:55.167
I may not care if I hide that.

04:55.988 --> 05:00.595
But to be able to watch and observe, I find it quite scary.

05:00.997 --> 05:06.750
I understand if there's some talk about, are they actually doing some television productions of these?

05:06.770 --> 05:07.572
Yes, they have.

05:07.612 --> 05:12.664
They've done, I think it's four or five of my books now, and I've only really been happy with one.

05:14.929 --> 05:17.014
But you understand, of course, that

05:17.382 --> 05:19.405
It's out of your hands at that point anyway.

05:19.425 --> 05:20.526
Terrible.

05:20.546 --> 05:24.492
The television people take over, the director and the producer take over.

05:24.632 --> 05:35.166
And I have learned that I've got to have it written into my contract, that I've got to be consulted about all sorts of stupid things, like what people were.

05:37.028 --> 05:40.173
And I've got to have a really good scriptwriter.

05:40.193 --> 05:41.955
I've been lucky in that several times.

05:43.049 --> 05:49.376
Even when you've got a very good scriptwriter, you're not safe with what's seen on the screen.

05:49.396 --> 05:59.827
Now, from this book, I know very little about your life, but I have to assume that gardening is essential for your own... I love gardening.

05:59.868 --> 06:02.931
I've got a very tiny, what I call a London gardener.

06:03.051 --> 06:06.855
I live in a country in a very small town, and I've got a tiny walled garden.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.737
I love it.

06:08.757 --> 06:10.379
And before that, I had a bigger one.

06:10.740 --> 06:13.022
It's a very therapeutic occupation.

06:13.222 --> 06:14.463
My wife is the same way.

06:14.483 --> 06:17.327
She goes out... Something to do with bonding down.

06:17.367 --> 06:20.009
The blood goes to her head and makes her think.

06:20.029 --> 06:21.191
And she loves flowers.

06:21.451 --> 06:23.073
She's not particularly keen on vegetables.

06:23.093 --> 06:26.857
We can buy vegetables at the food stand.

06:26.997 --> 06:32.443
I've never been able to grow vegetables successfully, but I do grow flowers.

06:32.543 --> 06:33.684
I like that.

06:33.704 --> 06:37.409
You mentioned therapy, but I think you see the garden here almost as metaphor.

06:38.029 --> 06:38.390
Yes.

06:38.870 --> 06:41.473
She's building, restoring something.

06:42.247 --> 06:46.556
And maybe tell me a little bit about, you know, the process.

06:48.019 --> 06:50.023
It's more than just seeing people that you know.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.906
It's also building a story.

06:51.926 --> 06:54.672
Well, this book, I mean, really, it's about pain, isn't it?

06:54.692 --> 07:03.630
It's about suffering and loss and the partial recovery of two wounded people getting together.

07:04.724 --> 07:09.288
But the way the book started was where I got the idea of the book.

07:09.348 --> 07:14.433
I was going up to London on the train, and I did see a sheep on his back on the field.

07:15.334 --> 07:23.542
And I've often in my life picked up a sheep, which they get, they've bred so big now, they get on our backs and can't get out, as they would if they were natural.

07:24.663 --> 07:30.228
And I thought, what sort of person would have the courage to stop the train, which I haven't got.

07:30.248 --> 07:32.470
It's beautiful.

07:33.142 --> 07:37.688
either have to be insane or in a state of trauma.

07:37.768 --> 07:41.132
And when you're in a state of trauma, you don't care what you do.

07:41.152 --> 07:47.880
So I have invented this girl in a state of trauma and grief.

07:48.521 --> 07:51.505
And the whole book started from that, from the sheep.

07:53.547 --> 08:02.018
Because you certainly believe in coincidence, too, the fact that they're able to... I say in that that it's unlikely, but the whole of life is coincidence.

08:02.487 --> 08:12.022
I mean, people get jobs through coincidence, friends, and another friend who's heard of a job, and a few might like, and that kind of thing.

08:12.082 --> 08:16.109
It's all coincidence, isn't it?

08:16.129 --> 08:17.151
It's amazing how often it's there.

08:18.353 --> 08:19.895
Of course.

08:19.915 --> 08:24.943
I think also that your books, you certainly profile a city.

08:25.043 --> 08:28.048
London becomes characters in its own way.

08:29.731 --> 08:29.811
Yes.

08:30.483 --> 08:36.953
And that's a very, you know, how often do you see a city profiled in the description?

08:36.973 --> 08:42.181
It's a part of London I know very intimately and have lived in.

08:42.441 --> 08:56.041
My children always laugh at me because they say, when we know Chelsea and I wish it to Kensington on the West End, because now everybody, because the price of living is so huge, they live scattered all around London.

08:56.061 --> 08:59.747
So that is my part of London I wrote about, and they are very well.

09:00.436 --> 09:06.383
Do you look at society with an amused eye yourself?

09:06.643 --> 09:07.004
I do.

09:07.084 --> 09:08.506
I love listening to people.

09:08.526 --> 09:17.476
I love listening to conversations and watching people and guessing at some motives.

09:17.496 --> 09:26.747
Something I have enjoyed doing for years is to be walking down a street in New York or sitting in a bar someplace.

09:27.352 --> 09:30.256
and just picking up a fragment of a conversation.

09:30.376 --> 09:31.117
Just a fragment.

09:31.137 --> 09:31.558
Oh, yes.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.661
And trying to make a narrative out of this.

09:33.681 --> 09:37.446
Trying to fill in just the one or two sentences that you hear.

09:37.486 --> 09:39.149
They might be very pregnant sentences.

09:39.249 --> 09:39.629
Absolutely.

09:39.669 --> 09:45.718
And the whole character will grow after that snippet of conversation I've overheard.

09:45.778 --> 09:48.121
The whole character may grow after this.

09:48.141 --> 09:51.466
And then the story becomes... You invent the story.

09:51.506 --> 09:54.049
Maybe you'd even be disappointed with the real story.

09:54.310 --> 09:55.051
Exactly, yes.

09:55.351 --> 09:56.633
Or you'll never know it.

09:57.119 --> 10:01.224
You never know why you've heard this exclamation.

10:02.165 --> 10:06.209
Have you kind of jotted things down through the years?

10:06.289 --> 10:08.312
No, not really.

10:09.593 --> 10:14.058
I do make notes when I'm working on a book.

10:14.078 --> 10:20.005
I make notes on my shopping list, on my newspaper, on the book I'm reading.

10:20.407 --> 10:28.537
a notebook by my bed, and I know those brilliant thoughts I have in the night, which are quite useless when you wake up in the morning, I write all of them down.

10:32.602 --> 10:39.310
The use of words I'm really interested in, and the movement language, the development language.

10:39.330 --> 10:50.143
I have a lot of friends who are, most of my friends are in their 50s, or the children are still at school or at university, and I listen to the language growing among the young.

10:51.237 --> 10:53.821
I find that fascinating.

10:53.841 --> 10:55.843
Are you generally an optimistic person?

10:58.607 --> 11:02.312
I worry about the state of the world.

11:02.332 --> 11:07.039
I worry about population explosion very much.

11:07.059 --> 11:08.862
I was talking about it recently.

11:10.584 --> 11:14.630
I'm sure it's the same in Boston or New York, any big city.

11:14.830 --> 11:19.236
I was walking around London, driving around London a couple of years ago, and I

11:19.655 --> 11:23.739
past my grandparents' house, which was a house of one family.

11:23.759 --> 11:25.621
It's now 14 apartments.

11:27.023 --> 11:32.508
And the house, so that means minimum 14 cars in London.

11:32.528 --> 11:38.394
And the house I lived in when I was first married in 1937.

11:38.515 --> 11:39.736
It's now six apartments.

11:40.977 --> 11:44.080
And the whole of London has exploded like that.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.743
Too many people, too many cars.

11:46.763 --> 11:48.565
And then my concern is to see

11:49.152 --> 11:54.140
In Japan, you have an oil gas attack by their own people.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.142
God, it sounds right.

11:55.162 --> 12:01.432
And in this country, we have, I mean, everybody, it was almost okay if it had been a Mideastern bomb blast.

12:01.612 --> 12:04.356
I said, thank God it was an American.

12:04.376 --> 12:08.443
But it's an American, a white American who blows up his children.

12:08.463 --> 12:09.845
I mean, this is what terrifies me.

12:09.865 --> 12:10.747
We're going to kill each other.

12:10.927 --> 12:11.548
We're going to kill each other.

12:12.271 --> 12:15.535
with nerve gas, with bombs, with nuclear weapons.

12:15.555 --> 12:20.321
And of course, I'm sure a lot of it has to do with overpopulation.

12:20.341 --> 12:22.604
How are these poor Africans going to feed themselves?

12:23.205 --> 12:26.509
I had to interview with Doris Lessing last fall.

12:27.030 --> 12:37.924
Her concern is that we introduced this corn over there that allows more people, the populations to grow quadruple.

12:38.630 --> 12:52.090
We've put the cart before the horse, and we've stopped babies dying, but we've now given them to eat when they've grown up.

12:52.951 --> 13:03.366
There's only one place I've heard of which is working, and that's Kerala, South India, which has got a so-called communist government, and they limit their families to two children.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.329
Everybody's listening to it.

13:05.613 --> 13:06.915
This is in India?

13:07.075 --> 13:07.436
Yes.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.641
I don't think the Indians were alert to this.

13:10.661 --> 13:14.967
I mean, all the rest of India is, you know, out of control.

13:15.047 --> 13:15.888
Out of control.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.954
But in Kerala, they limit their families to two.

13:20.515 --> 13:24.421
The girls go to school as well as the boys and get educated.

13:24.441 --> 13:27.526
It's a very good climate, so they grow a lot of food.

13:28.087 --> 13:32.774
If you're poor, you go to the state shop and you can always get your food.

13:33.234 --> 13:35.097
If you have a bit more money, you go to the other shop.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.327
And it works.

13:37.148 --> 13:38.690
I have a son who goes there a lot.

13:39.491 --> 13:48.183
He's the only place that's so-called communist, and he's just a version of liberalism, communism, whatever.

13:48.203 --> 13:51.387
How do you feel about these comparisons with Jane Austen?

13:52.389 --> 13:53.350
I'm very flattered.

13:53.691 --> 13:54.412
I must say.

13:54.652 --> 13:55.833
Thank you.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.822
Thank you very much.

14:01.942 --> 14:02.923
You're welcome.

14:03.207 --> 14:04.669
No, I'm extremely flattered.

14:04.689 --> 14:07.672
I love Jane Austen, but I held off.

14:08.453 --> 14:09.895
I'm very contrary by nature.

14:09.915 --> 14:14.280
I was always being told when I was young to read Jane Austen by my mother, and I never did.

14:14.981 --> 14:18.145
And I came to her very late.

14:18.305 --> 14:20.228
She's a wonderful writer.

14:20.328 --> 14:22.470
I was a literature major, Englishologist.

14:22.691 --> 14:26.095
I read her, you know, in about 1920.

14:26.195 --> 14:27.116
You know, that was a good age.

14:28.077 --> 14:29.839
I've gone back to her with great pleasure.

14:29.899 --> 14:30.480
She's wonderful.

14:31.118 --> 14:34.622
And I just did an interview last week with Patrick O'Brien, you know.

14:35.363 --> 14:36.024
Yes.

14:36.544 --> 14:40.308
And his work is often sometimes compared.

14:40.328 --> 14:42.391
He can say, is that the greatest compliment?

14:42.411 --> 14:44.033
She's an enormous compliment.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.896
Huge compliment.

14:46.916 --> 14:50.460
She's so witty and so observant.

14:50.480 --> 15:00.251
When you started writing these stories, I mean, I guess, does your success surprise you?

15:00.271 --> 15:01.092
Absolutely.

15:01.595 --> 15:09.006
And I can't, because I'm so old, lived so long without it, I find it difficult to take it seriously.

15:10.509 --> 15:19.242
I mean, I'm very amused when people say, you know, compare me with Jane Austen or write a book.

15:19.262 --> 15:22.227
And you mentioned how gardening is a therapeutic exercise.

15:22.347 --> 15:26.353
Would you say that writing started out a lot in much the same manner for you?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.276
Writing, I do.

15:28.336 --> 15:29.037
Yes, it was.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.546
a sort of therapy I felt a compulsory.

15:31.606 --> 15:34.188
I think it's a form of illness.

15:34.209 --> 15:37.332
Anybody not quite in my right mind wants to be a writer.

15:38.493 --> 15:41.537
I look upon it as a sort of disease I can't do without it.

15:42.798 --> 15:47.604
I used to go to bed and tell my children I was ill and I had flu, don't come near me.

15:47.624 --> 15:48.545
I wanted to write.

15:50.387 --> 15:53.510
Do you think that you're writing for yourself or do you have a certain reader in mind?

15:53.871 --> 15:54.231
Never.

15:55.072 --> 15:55.573
Never.

15:55.973 --> 15:59.317
I'll never thank my audience, or if I have one, at all.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.841
I'd write purely pleased myself.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.824
It's the kind of book that you'd enjoy reading, perhaps.

16:06.404 --> 16:06.925
I don't know.

16:07.586 --> 16:11.790
It's just a situation I want to create and see if I can sort it out.

16:13.012 --> 16:23.323
And when you're creating these, because since the sequence of novels has started to be published, I mean, you've been exceedingly prolific, I mean.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.046
What are you doing?

16:25.066 --> 16:26.367
About one a year or perhaps?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.969
Not quite, but I've had nine.

16:28.389 --> 16:28.570
Nine?

16:29.070 --> 16:30.872
Nine in 14 years, yes.

16:30.952 --> 16:31.873
Which is not bad.

16:31.893 --> 16:41.183
There's about one every 18 months or whatever.

16:41.203 --> 16:41.984
Where was I going?

16:42.004 --> 16:42.805
I was asking the question.

16:42.825 --> 16:44.767
But apparently they come very easily to you.

16:44.947 --> 16:47.269
Do you get into them?

16:47.289 --> 16:48.450
No, not really.

16:48.751 --> 16:49.952
Not really easily.

16:50.253 --> 16:54.659
It fits and starts as the characters develop, and I cannot harry it.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.524
I don't write work as fast as I did.

17:03.931 --> 17:08.396
My first novel had been written about five years before it was published.

17:08.416 --> 17:08.697
Really?

17:09.558 --> 17:11.961
And refused by a lot of publishers.

17:12.001 --> 17:15.265
They only think I wrote a book a year, and I was already...

17:15.903 --> 17:19.346
about a third into the next novel when I chose that one.

17:19.466 --> 17:21.629
And that came out a year later.

17:21.649 --> 17:25.973
So then they think I wrote a book a year, but it's not quite true.

17:25.993 --> 17:33.420
And how did it come to pass that you were able to, after so much, not so much, but after rejection?

17:35.062 --> 17:35.883
Just persistence.

17:35.983 --> 17:39.446
I think my agent had said to me, I've shown your manuscripts through.

17:39.546 --> 17:43.530
They've been refused by five publishers, and publishing is a bit sad at the moment.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.572
I don't want to show them to any more publishers.

17:46.615 --> 18:10.631
And I had met somebody at Macmillan who had been kind to me about a children's book of mine, and had said, as all publishers do, this is not for our lists, and if you write anything else, you'd love to see it, which is a way to get you out of their office.

18:10.651 --> 18:16.099
And I wrote to him, and I said, I now have a novel, and would you look at it?

18:16.332 --> 18:18.275
And he wrote and said, do send it to me.

18:19.176 --> 18:28.087
And he was actually head of crime of Macmillan, but he had a new fiction editor who'd arrived the week before, who's still my editor.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.429
He freelances for me.

18:30.270 --> 18:41.585
And he read my manuscript, and he took it to this young man, James Hare, and said, I think you'll like this.

18:41.605 --> 18:43.087
And he took me on.

18:44.509 --> 18:45.951
But the joke was that

18:47.078 --> 18:48.660
It took him about five years to tell him.

18:48.680 --> 18:54.748
For the next year, I worried terribly because he said lots of people can write one book and the next one.

18:54.908 --> 18:56.170
I was 70 years old.

18:56.190 --> 18:59.254
It's a risk to take on somebody of 70.

18:59.274 --> 19:03.119
I heard an editor saying the other day, we never take anybody over the age of 25.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.463
Come on.

19:05.483 --> 19:10.069
This is a head of fiction as a paper, Robert McCrum.

19:10.089 --> 19:11.010
It's disgraceful.

19:11.210 --> 19:17.842
Anyway, my editor worried and bit his nails for a year, because I wouldn't tell you to say, how's the book?

19:17.862 --> 19:22.410
And I'd say, you'll see it when it's finished.

19:22.430 --> 19:25.997
And when I had finished it, I sent it to him.

19:26.017 --> 19:29.663
And he was so enthusiastic, I thought he'd gone mad.

19:29.683 --> 19:34.151
And I said, it was relief, of course, that it wasn't bad.

19:35.133 --> 19:35.614
And...

19:35.999 --> 19:39.142
I remember saying to him, I'm not going to believe what you're saying.

19:39.182 --> 19:40.723
If you write, put it in writing.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.126
And he sat down and he wrote me a six-page letter.

19:44.327 --> 19:48.091
And about five years later, he said, now I can tell you.

19:48.131 --> 19:50.453
For a whole year, I'm worried.

19:50.493 --> 19:55.157
What am I going to say to this woman when the second book is bad and I can't publish it?

19:56.939 --> 19:58.440
He was expecting it to be bad.

19:58.821 --> 20:04.386
No, he was afraid it might be because, I mean, they always say everybody's got one book.

20:04.990 --> 20:08.495
and he was expecting, thinking it might possibly be bad.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.920
He was delighted with it, thank God.

20:13.082 --> 20:22.836
So where was the general response to the first book?

20:22.856 --> 20:28.484
I had a wonderful review for my first book in the Times, and I had one of the best put-downs I've ever had in my life.

20:28.504 --> 20:34.693
I was walking down the street in my little town, and I met a fellow novelist who was a failure,

20:35.163 --> 20:36.184
And he said, how are you?

20:36.204 --> 20:38.567
And I said, I'm walking on air.

20:38.587 --> 20:42.131
I'm so happy because I've had a lovely reviewing of times.

20:43.031 --> 20:46.735
And he said, Nicholas Shakespeare's so kind.

20:46.756 --> 20:49.378
So wonderful.

20:50.560 --> 20:56.326
And I think there's no more wonderful feeling than to have your book accepted.

20:56.346 --> 20:56.826
Wonderful.

20:57.367 --> 21:00.590
My first book has been published this summer by Holmes.

21:00.610 --> 21:02.232
And you're feeling marvelous.

21:02.673 --> 21:04.595
And I'm 52 years old almost.

21:04.615 --> 21:04.815
And I'm...

21:05.572 --> 21:08.455
I don't particularly think I'm old to be published by a person.

21:08.515 --> 21:09.517
Of course we're not.

21:09.577 --> 21:10.157
Fifty-two.

21:10.177 --> 21:10.878
Of course not.

21:10.898 --> 21:12.620
I've been working on it for eight years, too.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.704
It's really quite lovely.

21:15.724 --> 21:20.189
We just closed the galley on it this week in my dust jackets.

21:20.209 --> 21:22.511
We got picked up by a small book club here.

21:22.952 --> 21:23.733
Yeah, I'm feeling ready.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.074
Very exciting.

21:25.194 --> 21:28.318
It is, but there's also this anxiety, too, isn't it?

21:28.338 --> 21:28.779
Oh, terrible.

21:28.799 --> 21:29.920
It never gets me better.

21:30.961 --> 21:31.782
Each time I...

21:32.217 --> 21:32.998
finished book.

21:33.218 --> 21:35.261
I've been terrified.

21:35.281 --> 21:37.344
It's like sending your child out into the world.

21:38.505 --> 21:38.806
It's funny.

21:38.826 --> 21:44.453
I just sent out the desk jacket picture to my editor, and I had a couple more corrections.

21:44.713 --> 21:45.674
I said, please.

21:46.476 --> 21:47.897
He said, Nick, you have to let it go.

21:47.937 --> 21:50.300
He said, this is exactly what you're saying.

21:50.341 --> 21:51.262
There comes a point.

21:51.682 --> 21:52.483
He said, it's beautiful.

21:52.623 --> 21:53.044
We love it.

21:53.345 --> 21:58.790
But Natalie said you have to release it and let it go, and it'll be fine.

21:58.830 --> 22:00.151
You can't change it anymore.

22:00.172 --> 22:01.092
Can't do anymore.

22:01.233 --> 22:06.878
And then the world is there, really, to criticize and write reviews and pick on it.

22:07.258 --> 22:08.640
And that's fine.

22:09.040 --> 22:12.764
And it's going to be read by a whole lot of people I've never met in my life.

22:13.084 --> 22:16.907
And I'm always terrified.

22:17.568 --> 22:18.609
Are you?

22:18.629 --> 22:20.010
Do you hear from a lot of readers?

22:20.211 --> 22:22.693
I get a lot of vessels, yes.

22:24.074 --> 22:27.558
extraordinary cross-section of people from the age of 14 to sort of 19.

22:27.698 --> 22:28.218
No kidding.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.163
So there's no profile of your readers?

22:32.183 --> 22:32.463
No.

22:32.723 --> 22:34.585
And men and women.

22:34.605 --> 22:45.957
I remember getting a wonderful letter from a lawyer in Chicago who said, for several years, my wife and daughters have been bullying me to read your books, and I've held up.

22:45.977 --> 22:49.421
He said, I have just finished the last.

22:49.481 --> 22:53.305
I've read that whole lot on the trot, and it is four in the morning.

22:53.943 --> 22:55.765
And I'm writing to tell you I love them.

22:56.406 --> 23:00.711
And I thought, that is the most lovely little letter I've ever had.

23:01.712 --> 23:05.116
And a month or two later, I was signing in Russia.

23:05.256 --> 23:06.757
I wrote back to him, of course.

23:07.498 --> 23:09.380
I was signing books in London.

23:10.041 --> 23:22.515
And two very tall American girls bent over to the desk I was sitting at and said, you wrote to our pa, you thanked him for his letter, and we want you to sign this new book of yours to take home to Chicago.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.741
That is very rewarding.

23:25.322 --> 23:25.662
Lovely.

23:25.682 --> 23:26.483
It really is.

23:26.603 --> 23:27.524
Really lovely.

23:27.544 --> 23:28.785
How often do you connect with that?

23:29.486 --> 23:30.547
Not very often.

23:30.567 --> 23:31.808
You kind of connect to the book.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.108
Yes.

23:32.949 --> 23:36.392
But actually the physical contact like that.

23:36.853 --> 23:37.513
It's lovely.

23:37.533 --> 23:38.754
Yes.

23:39.075 --> 23:41.217
There's a boy who's been writing to me.

23:41.237 --> 23:41.997
He's a man now.

23:42.017 --> 23:42.798
He's a doctor.

23:42.818 --> 23:44.940
He's been writing to me since he was 14.

23:45.821 --> 23:52.587
And he turned up when I was signing in Hatchard's in London.

23:53.107 --> 23:57.652
He came up to me and said, I'm Jamie, look at the world, it's full of Jamie's.

23:57.672 --> 24:04.539
And I said, yes, of course, wondering who the hell Jamie was.

24:05.300 --> 24:14.510
And then he kept on writing, and he said he was going to Cambridge, and I was going to Cambridge to design, and I thought, I must watch out for Jamie.

24:15.130 --> 24:19.755
And he appeared again, and he had all the cuttings, all the critics.

24:20.410 --> 24:28.901
And he turned up and I was able to say, Jamie, and recognize him.

24:28.961 --> 24:32.366
What is it that you think connected with him?

24:32.386 --> 24:33.327
I don't know.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.451
That's got to be so grand.

24:36.471 --> 24:40.437
He had loved my books and he made all his friends read them.

24:41.077 --> 24:44.562
And I was absolutely delighted.

24:45.622 --> 24:50.228
What a great feeling that was, because you're writing young men.

24:50.308 --> 24:52.871
Young men, girls, old women.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.654
These are books for?

24:55.555 --> 24:58.759
All ages, yes.

25:00.922 --> 25:07.110
It's very beautiful to get letters from young people as well as middle-aged stories.

25:07.410 --> 25:12.777
There was a piece that I read about you, and I think it was a vanity fair or whatever.

25:15.811 --> 25:19.236
But how pertinent is your earlier life?

25:22.480 --> 25:25.284
A member of the aristocracy, so to speak?

25:25.364 --> 25:26.386
Well, I get set up with that.

25:26.406 --> 25:30.812
I was only married to that man for about five years, and I lived to him for three.

25:31.973 --> 25:40.245
And I get very annoyed that it seems to matter that I married somebody with a title.

25:40.265 --> 25:42.207
To me, it's just no importance, whatever.

25:42.227 --> 25:44.991
Well, I saw a wonderful quote from you.

25:45.832 --> 25:49.095
Somebody asked, when did you know that you'd made a mistake?

25:49.115 --> 25:57.303
And I think you said halfway into the cell phone.

25:57.323 --> 25:57.564
That's true.

25:57.584 --> 25:58.264
Classography, yes.

25:58.284 --> 26:02.649
So that was Nicholas, Christopher Hitchens from Banner de Clare.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.471
Yeah, I was very pleased to that.

26:05.491 --> 26:05.572
Yes.

26:05.592 --> 26:14.100
He was quite amusing, because we got off very well, because he'd written an exposé of Mother Teresa.

26:15.076 --> 26:16.898
Oh, I know that piece.

26:16.918 --> 26:18.881
And I so approve that.

26:18.901 --> 26:23.047
I mean, she goes round the world selling... Is he the one who wrote that?

26:23.067 --> 26:23.287
Yes.

26:23.347 --> 26:27.933
I've seen a scapegoat piece on Mother Teresa that she... That he wrote that.

26:27.953 --> 26:28.754
She's a phony.

26:29.075 --> 26:29.976
She's a phony.

26:30.036 --> 26:43.074
She goes round to people like Robert Maxwell, who was the biggest crook there ever was, and gets money from the poor, and doesn't spend it on the poor, but builds more contents.

26:43.094 --> 26:43.294
And

26:44.067 --> 26:49.074
Preachers like the Pope, I'm a Catholic and I say what I like about him.

26:49.094 --> 26:55.683
Preachers like the Pope, they've got more and more children, more and more little Catholics.

26:55.703 --> 26:57.545
I think it's so wicked.

26:57.565 --> 26:58.266
That's interesting.

26:58.286 --> 27:01.591
I also read about your, you converted to Catholicism, isn't that right?

27:01.931 --> 27:04.114
Because you love Latin.

27:04.134 --> 27:08.139
Yes, I love the theater of the Catholic Church.

27:08.159 --> 27:09.301
I love Latin.

27:09.321 --> 27:10.482
It was about spiritual.

27:10.603 --> 27:11.644
Yes, spiritual.

27:11.928 --> 27:14.110
I also had read Théard de Chardin.

27:14.130 --> 27:15.511
Have you ever read him?

27:15.531 --> 27:16.352
No, I'm sorry.

27:16.953 --> 27:20.096
He was a Jesuit priest who was excommunicated by the church.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.299
He spent the large part of his life in China.

27:23.879 --> 27:26.121
He's now looked upon as a saint.

27:26.161 --> 27:27.162
He's a philosopher.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.165
And he wrote extremely obtruse books.

27:30.305 --> 27:36.511
And I remember when my husband, who was highly intelligent, said, I can't make him tell you these books.

27:36.531 --> 27:39.454
But I was absorbed in them.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.138
And I cooked it up.

27:41.198 --> 27:43.961
And then also I read Timon Weil.

27:44.101 --> 27:44.842
Do you remember her?

27:46.023 --> 27:48.066
And she influenced me.

27:48.086 --> 27:49.447
She wouldn't become a Catholic.

27:49.467 --> 27:51.769
She influenced me.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.954
And as a child, we lived in Italy.

27:55.994 --> 28:04.623
And my mother used to take us to Catholic churches to listen to the sermons to improve our Italian.

28:05.324 --> 28:08.547
Not for any other reason.

28:08.847 --> 28:11.330
said we'd hear, she thought, good Italian.

28:12.211 --> 28:17.456
Well, of course, the bishop or the Monsignore might have had a terrible Italian accent for what she knew.

28:18.397 --> 28:24.224
But I loved the smell of innocence and the beauty of it.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.907
And that had great attraction to me.

28:26.927 --> 28:34.195
Whereas my husband came to Catholicism through Dostoevsky.

28:34.455 --> 28:36.057
Interesting way.

28:36.077 --> 28:37.318
My background is Greek.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.329
And of course, there's the Greek Orthodox Church.

28:40.349 --> 28:43.675
The Greek Orthodox Church, the gain out of this world.

28:43.715 --> 28:44.757
Beautiful.

28:44.777 --> 28:47.903
And of course, the Greek Easter was just this past weekend.

28:47.923 --> 28:51.769
And that is always, I mean, we go once a year just because it's theater.

28:51.970 --> 28:54.414
It's theater and wonderful music.

28:54.514 --> 28:56.718
With that one candle that comes forward.

28:56.738 --> 28:56.819
Yes.

28:57.460 --> 28:59.323
And this flood of fire just kind of.

29:00.164 --> 29:00.845
It sweeps back.

29:01.526 --> 29:02.928
It's really wonderful.

29:03.028 --> 29:03.850
It's really uplifting.

29:04.050 --> 29:10.320
I don't know necessarily in a spiritual way, but it's theater, and it's art, and we go to the theater.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.822
And it'll come away feeling great.

29:12.022 --> 29:15.868
And the incense goes up to the place.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.833
And the same with the Greek or the Russian Orthodox.

29:18.893 --> 29:21.677
It's more of the deep voices.

29:22.078 --> 29:23.460
Greek, you have.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.685
They're the same church, basically.

29:26.705 --> 29:28.568
There's chants.

29:28.970 --> 29:29.891
Very lovely.

29:30.112 --> 29:31.133
Very nice.

29:31.153 --> 29:33.296
And I love the Gregorian chants, too.

29:33.316 --> 29:41.108
It was a program of Gregorian chants that my wife and I watched for a while back.

29:41.128 --> 29:41.529
It was quite moving.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.011
We get them on disc now.

29:43.091 --> 29:46.917
We get them on tape from Solemne in France.

29:47.918 --> 29:52.925
And actually, the most beautiful is the Masters of the Dead.

29:52.945 --> 29:53.626
I have them.

29:54.287 --> 29:55.429
I play them a lot.

29:55.509 --> 29:56.911
They're very good to work, too.

29:57.152 --> 29:58.393
They're peaceful.

29:58.413 --> 29:58.774
They're marvelous.

29:59.041 --> 30:02.847
from all this time.

30:02.927 --> 30:06.733
I call myself a French Catholic because I'm such a bad one.

30:07.494 --> 30:17.209
I love your reasoning for becoming a Philly because of the Latin and the pageantry and all this other stuff.

30:17.229 --> 30:19.052
It's kind of fun.

30:19.072 --> 30:20.674
How do you write longhand?

30:20.794 --> 30:22.116
I can't type.

30:22.277 --> 30:23.639
I'm the last of the Luddites.

30:23.659 --> 30:24.861
I hate anything mechanical.

30:24.921 --> 30:27.765
I write longhand when I'm sufficiently

30:28.032 --> 30:28.733
satisfied.

30:28.753 --> 30:31.096
I could have typed up by somebody else.

30:31.116 --> 30:34.141
And then do you revise again?

30:34.601 --> 30:39.248
Probably revise, but by the time it goes to her, I've revised and revised.

30:39.989 --> 30:43.694
Are you serendipitous, or are these things fairly well plotted and outlined?

30:44.355 --> 30:47.059
No, the book usually builds up as I go along.

30:47.139 --> 30:52.287
I may know when I start a book, I may know the end, or I may know the middle, or I may know the beginning.

30:52.868 --> 30:54.630
In one book, I knew the end.

30:55.387 --> 30:59.191
and I had to work out how was this end that happened.

30:59.211 --> 31:01.273
What a great country.

31:01.814 --> 31:10.964
My sex was not all become my law, and I wanted to try and describe the atmosphere as I knew it when I was young in the war.

31:11.805 --> 31:15.809
The people of my generation are a bit younger, what we got up to.

31:16.750 --> 31:21.616
And it was a very odd atmosphere.

31:21.816 --> 31:22.997
If you haven't lived in it,

31:23.753 --> 31:25.035
can't understand it.

31:25.055 --> 31:34.025
It's very erotic for one thing and very exciting and people will do things they wouldn't do otherwise and might not have time again.

31:36.008 --> 31:50.585
And I knew a lot of people who were fighting and a lot of my friends got killed and actually a lot of women were getting killed as well as civilians.

31:50.605 --> 31:53.068
But it was a very strange

31:53.707 --> 31:58.294
at the Strandee, which I've never known the lack of since.

32:00.317 --> 32:07.308
And I wanted to put that down on PayPal, and I'm told I succeeded by people of my generation.

32:07.328 --> 32:10.754
That's pretty gratifying.

32:10.974 --> 32:17.925
The fellow who wrote the manuscript, he was almost embarrassed to ask you about that.

32:19.576 --> 32:24.100
It was an awful lot.

32:25.061 --> 32:26.482
Nobody wasted any time.

32:26.502 --> 32:28.604
It was an awful lot.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.727
It went on all the way.

32:31.987 --> 32:34.610
You haven't had any degree of reticence about that.

32:34.630 --> 32:42.958
You talk about being a shy person in general, but it doesn't seem to affect you in your writing.

32:42.978 --> 32:43.818
In writing, no.

32:44.619 --> 32:46.000
Operal sex is part of life.

32:46.020 --> 32:46.561
It's in everything.

32:46.581 --> 32:47.322
It's in music.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.823
It's in painting.

32:49.276 --> 32:50.658
literatures and everything.

32:50.798 --> 32:53.181
You can't write a book without it.

32:54.642 --> 32:59.108
Yes, we're writing about some scientific subjects, even then.

33:03.093 --> 33:04.034
And it doesn't die.

33:04.074 --> 33:12.524
People think there's a wonderful... I'm always asked, you know, why... In other words, why, as you're so old, do you write sexy books?

33:13.365 --> 33:14.647
I mean, you forgot about it.

33:15.307 --> 33:16.349
I didn't ask that quite.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.410
You didn't ask.

33:18.301 --> 33:20.143
Stupid people ask me.

33:20.804 --> 33:23.508
And there's no moment in life.

33:23.588 --> 33:25.010
There's a moment when you shut off.

33:25.811 --> 33:26.572
There's no more sex.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.214
When does that happen?

33:28.294 --> 33:29.636
I'd like to know.

33:30.877 --> 33:31.258
Never.

33:31.358 --> 33:32.560
I hope it never happens.

33:32.580 --> 33:33.020
Never.

33:35.624 --> 33:37.666
In fact, if anything, I think we appreciate it more.

33:37.887 --> 33:38.247
Yes.

33:41.611 --> 33:43.213
I'm not going to think of too much of your time.

33:43.274 --> 33:46.738
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to inscribe the

33:46.955 --> 33:47.976
Indeed I will.

33:48.237 --> 33:54.945
I have lots of pencils.

34:00.111 --> 34:02.213
This is done by a designer?

34:02.994 --> 34:12.726
They wanted to revamp my paperbacks with all of my previous books.

34:13.364 --> 34:21.152
And they started sending me these photographs, and the first lot were bad, but they've got some rather good ones now, and for the paperback.

34:21.173 --> 34:23.675
The problem with that is... It looks neat.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.357
It's quite a smart color.

34:25.377 --> 34:31.003
It's lovely, but it gives a visual... I wonder, do you see your characters?

34:31.304 --> 34:33.506
Do you have a visual image of what they look like?

34:34.207 --> 34:37.270
Well, there's very little description in that book of what they look like.

34:37.310 --> 34:38.932
They describe her... I mean, for you.

34:39.212 --> 34:40.013
Yes, for me.

34:40.212 --> 34:44.165
Yes, I do see them, not very often, not complete.

34:44.607 --> 34:47.095
But that's not a variance with what you see?

34:47.115 --> 34:50.205
No, that's more or less all right.
