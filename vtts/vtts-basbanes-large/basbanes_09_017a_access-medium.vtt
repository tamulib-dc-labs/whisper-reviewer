00:06.545 --> 00:09.227
I have the word catharsis in here.

00:09.528 --> 00:11.389
That's the word she used.

00:12.610 --> 00:14.252
Yes, my daughter read the book.

00:15.093 --> 00:20.958
Well, she's had the book for a couple of weeks, and she also was reading it as I would give her pages, every 30, 40 pages.

00:20.998 --> 00:22.099
She's the only one I did it with.

00:22.119 --> 00:24.481
I didn't show anyone, not even my wife, the book.

00:24.981 --> 00:25.662
Just Nancy.

00:26.282 --> 00:34.570
And she said she read up until the last 30 pages, and then she couldn't go near it for about two weeks, and then she finally did.

00:34.830 --> 00:35.050
And

00:35.401 --> 00:51.865
She said although she cried a lot, it became a catharsis for her because she remembers it differently and she didn't realize what went on between me and Joan's mother and finally my two friends who were the only ones that got me through it.

00:52.366 --> 00:54.589
But it was like a whole new experience for her.

00:55.250 --> 00:59.216
She feels that she's been filled in with a lot of information that she didn't know.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.320
And she's the one you didn't tell.

01:02.907 --> 01:04.630
She's the one I didn't tell, right.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.394
She's the daughter that you actually felt very badly at the end.

01:07.534 --> 01:07.974
Terrible.

01:08.816 --> 01:11.680
And what you say very clearly in the book.

01:11.900 --> 01:24.519
Yeah, and she says, because her daughter, her sister was five years older, is five years older, and she said she just wished she had fought that five years more with Joan than as Ellen did.

01:27.784 --> 01:30.788
And I have to tell you, there are some very funny lines in here.

01:31.068 --> 01:31.429
Well...

01:31.628 --> 01:34.290
That's part of my business.

01:34.310 --> 01:38.715
But I wasn't sure I'd be able to do it in prose, but I think I found a way.

01:38.735 --> 01:53.028
And I think my playwriting career helped me write this book because I seem to have a natural ability, I guess, for construction, even though I don't sit down to plan the construction.

01:53.908 --> 01:59.914
But I find whenever I write something, there's usually a beginning, middle, and end, even though I may deviate and go...

02:00.400 --> 02:01.801
go back and forth in time.

02:02.562 --> 02:08.448
How long now did you rewrite this with the same intensity that you do the day?

02:10.350 --> 02:25.244
Well, not quite as much, because when you do a play and you try out the play, you're trying it out night after night after night, and there are different audience reactions, and there are different critics as you, well, not during the previous, but certainly when you're out of town.

02:25.644 --> 02:28.467
So you keep adjusting it and adjusting it.

02:28.767 --> 02:38.707
Here the rewrites came mostly from when I finished the book, put it aside for about a month or so, then went back and started to read it and started to fix things up.

02:39.067 --> 02:47.424
Then came the process of working with the editors who would say, that's a wonderful story, but I think it's irrelevant to what you're saying at this point.

02:47.504 --> 02:48.666
Let's leave that out.

02:49.152 --> 02:50.494
unless you don't want to.

02:50.514 --> 02:51.635
They're very good about that.

02:51.715 --> 02:53.197
It's a different experience for you, isn't it?

02:53.217 --> 02:56.882
I mean, because a playwright, now that I think of it, doesn't really work with an editor.

02:56.902 --> 02:57.623
No, not at all.

02:57.804 --> 03:08.678
The closest you come is with a director who will only suggest, but he knows that you're going to see up on stage what he sees, so you both make the decision at the same time.

03:09.099 --> 03:17.590
But here I was relying a lot on what Michael Corder and Chuck Adams at Simon & Schuster had to say about it.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.329
And sometimes they'd say, you didn't go far enough with this.

03:20.369 --> 03:20.890
This is good.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.131
Let's hear more about it.

03:22.611 --> 03:27.095
And once they wanted to know why I left out something.

03:27.155 --> 03:28.256
I can't recall what it was.

03:28.977 --> 03:33.521
So I wrote them a two-page letter to tell them why I left this thing out of the book.

03:34.242 --> 03:38.025
And Chuck Adams called me back and he says, can I put the letter in the book?

03:38.105 --> 03:42.029
Because it explains exactly what I wanted to know about this specific subject.

03:42.569 --> 03:44.251
So that process was wonderful.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.733
And then you go through the various, as you know,

03:47.135 --> 03:52.603
of various other editors, the one who just cleans up the... The copy editor.

03:52.923 --> 03:56.868
The copy editor, right, the grammar and the spelling, etc.

03:57.289 --> 03:58.751
But then there's the legal one.

03:59.732 --> 04:05.260
And that kind of drove me crazy, because they would say, can you verify that your mother and father have these fights?

04:05.861 --> 04:08.324
And I said, I beg your pardon, I was there.

04:08.344 --> 04:11.809
I mean, they are just so specific about things.

04:12.042 --> 04:12.964
They're so afraid.

04:13.284 --> 04:14.025
Well, they didn't know.

04:14.045 --> 04:18.933
They said, well, perhaps your father is alive and he's going to come and sue us for this.

04:18.993 --> 04:22.339
I have to tell you, my own experience, that's ridiculous.

04:22.419 --> 04:22.659
It is.

04:23.441 --> 04:24.402
With all due respect.

04:24.783 --> 04:27.888
It must have been a young copy editor, somebody who knew it.

04:27.908 --> 04:28.489
Well, I don't know.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.093
They're just a voice, you know, or a fax away.

04:34.078 --> 04:36.582
I'm just so impressed and amazed by it.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.135
this process of writing for performance.

04:39.155 --> 04:43.881
I mean, every work, it seems, is a work, a play is a continual work in progress.

04:43.921 --> 04:45.202
Yes, it's malleable.

04:45.222 --> 04:46.523
You keep changing and changing.

04:46.543 --> 04:49.867
And you don't get that with the book, I guess, once it's done.

04:49.947 --> 04:50.908
Once it's done, I know.

04:50.928 --> 04:51.249
I can't go back.

04:51.269 --> 04:54.672
I mean, would you like to go back and tinker with any parts of it now?

04:54.692 --> 04:55.854
Oh, I guess, sure.

04:56.134 --> 04:57.676
I mean, there's not a thing I've ever written.

04:58.597 --> 05:00.999
I don't know why.

05:01.500 --> 05:06.265
About tinkering, that I do go back with plays that have opened.

05:06.785 --> 05:11.971
And I go back a couple of months later and I said, let's take out that speech and let me add a different speech there.

05:11.991 --> 05:13.873
I think I could, I finally fixed it.

05:13.893 --> 05:28.451
There's a play I did Laughter on the 23rd floor and there was an exit line that truly needed a laugh because it was the Sid Caesar character called Max Prince left on an exit line and it cried out for something funny at that moment.

05:28.871 --> 05:29.952
And I never could get it.

05:29.972 --> 05:33.957
Three months later, it just, my daughter said something to me, uh,

05:34.240 --> 05:39.767
It's about April, June, and November, and I switched the words around, and I was able to put it in.

05:40.889 --> 05:46.016
So it won't happen with rewrites, but I'll get another chance, because there'll be a sequel to this.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.099
I have to write the second half of my life.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.944
You say very early in the book you love great beginnings.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.247
Well, it's true, I do, yeah.

05:54.267 --> 05:56.951
They have everything in life and plays.

05:56.971 --> 06:00.956
A. Bowes, the author, said anyone can write a first act to a play.

06:00.976 --> 06:01.797
It's the second act.

06:02.418 --> 06:03.960
It's what separates the boys from the men.

06:04.767 --> 06:05.969
Or the girl from the lake.

06:07.791 --> 06:12.678
But it seems to me that you've already set up the beginning for the sequel.

06:12.839 --> 06:30.724
Well, I set it in the introduction, because I wrote the introduction after I finished the book, and I intended to write the full book, but when I cut to around page 400, which has been reduced a little bit, I said, if I keep on writing the next 20-some-odd years,

06:31.126 --> 06:32.127
It's another 400.

06:32.147 --> 06:35.973
I don't want an 800-page book as an autobiography.

06:35.993 --> 06:38.336
It just seems presumptuous on my part.

06:38.877 --> 06:41.200
And I felt spent.

06:42.242 --> 06:47.569
After I wrote those last 25, 30 pages about Joan, I said, I just don't want to deal with it anymore.

06:49.151 --> 06:51.895
So he put aside, and Michael Carter said, absolutely.

06:51.955 --> 06:53.978
He says, we'll do the sequel next time.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.623
Do you know what the first printing was, just out of curiosity?

06:57.890 --> 06:59.292
I think 60,000.

06:59.312 --> 07:05.101
Now they're up to 80,000.

07:05.442 --> 07:14.537
People think that you, because you've written so many really genuinely funny things, that you probably always expect it to be funny.

07:15.137 --> 07:16.700
Well, they may have in the beginning.

07:16.800 --> 07:25.534
I think with the plays that I've done in the last 15 years, which have been much more serious plays, at least the subjects are dramatic, even though there is comedy within it.

07:26.088 --> 07:28.431
they stopped expecting that from me.

07:29.152 --> 07:32.998
But with critics, it's interesting.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.803
It's such a love-hate relationship.

07:36.903 --> 07:39.026
I love it when you learn something from them.

07:39.807 --> 07:48.199
When they are there, there are some, what I call the gunfighters, the gunslingers, the ones who are just out there, bang, there's the next play, I'm going to shoot it down.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.782
I mean, in the New York Times, there was this guy.

07:51.503 --> 07:54.087
It really irritated me

07:54.320 --> 08:13.061
not so much about what he didn't like about it, because I've gotten some really wonderful reviews with this, but he started comparing the end of the book, of my telling of the death of Joan, as being, of course it's going to move anybody, but it wasn't as good as the one I did in the play of Jake's Women.

08:13.682 --> 08:21.711
And that irritated me so much, because he was now treating something that is so important to me and to my family as a

08:22.096 --> 08:26.742
Something about commerce, you know, gee, I could do the ending of Joan's death better.

08:27.422 --> 08:30.166
I could make it more touching, more emotional.

08:30.867 --> 08:35.873
It's mind-boggling that somebody would be so idiotic to write something like that.

08:36.193 --> 08:39.978
But this is a man from Variety they got to write the review.

08:40.018 --> 08:43.282
I said, give me William Sapphire, give me John Upback.

08:43.322 --> 08:47.267
You know, if you want to knock the pros, I'll take it from them, but Variety not.

08:47.507 --> 08:50.010
The only bad review I got in my book,

08:50.648 --> 08:51.429
was in the L.A.

08:51.469 --> 08:53.553
Times by some putz.

08:53.573 --> 08:55.676
It's a copy editor for Variety.

08:55.696 --> 08:58.140
He clearly didn't even read the book.

08:58.260 --> 09:01.285
I don't want to get into it.

09:01.305 --> 09:02.727
I know how you feel.

09:02.787 --> 09:03.669
It's from Variety.

09:03.929 --> 09:09.298
These people don't realize how much of your heart and your soul goes into this thing.

09:09.318 --> 09:15.728
And with a 20-minute review, how hurtful it can be.

09:16.163 --> 09:24.557
I guess the people who don't write books, because I was interviewed by a woman this morning who works for Theatre Week, and I told her how irritated I was.

09:25.359 --> 09:31.329
I mean, I'm used to getting bad reviews in the New York Times, and you can't complain about a bad review on your play.

09:31.509 --> 09:32.591
It's not done.

09:33.152 --> 09:40.585
But I wasn't complaining about this review, which was, if you don't get to the last paragraph, it was a very good review.

09:42.168 --> 09:47.835
This thing of singling out how I portrayed my wife's death in one thing as opposed to another.

09:48.836 --> 09:50.318
You see what kind of a mind that is.

09:50.859 --> 09:57.106
And also that it comes from variety, which is not known for their prose, I wouldn't say.

09:57.126 --> 10:01.392
I think that in drama, the review is so much more important.

10:02.253 --> 10:06.037
I mean, it can really spell the difference between life and death.

10:06.057 --> 10:09.582
Well, because you've only got about eight or nine that make any difference.

10:10.262 --> 10:10.723
And...

10:10.990 --> 10:31.557
although I've overcome a lot of New York Times bad reviews, if the play is solid and the word of mouth is good during the previews, you can overcome it and they'll just say, oh, well, that critic, he always does that to me or to somebody else because Frank Rich, who was the critic for so many years, there was called The Butcher of Broadway with good reason, I think.

10:33.079 --> 10:38.706
But he could give you a good review and if the audiences don't like the play, they're just not going to come.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.288
So it's up to them

10:41.416 --> 10:43.599
Initially, or eventually, rather.

10:43.619 --> 10:47.183
That's what you have to live with.

10:47.223 --> 10:55.073
I just read in the Times a couple days ago that there was this monster musical, I guess, on Broadway.

10:55.433 --> 10:55.553
Big?

10:56.014 --> 10:56.855
Yeah.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.617
Close to a $10 million loss.

10:58.637 --> 10:59.698
$10 million loss.

10:59.919 --> 11:01.641
It's unbelievable.

11:02.281 --> 11:06.627
In the grand scheme of things, that's not a lot of money, is it?

11:07.147 --> 11:08.028
Yeah, it's a lot of money.

11:08.048 --> 11:09.330
$10 million for painting.

11:09.428 --> 11:18.156
Oh, well, someone pays $80 million for a building, but $10 million for a musical, the stakes are big.

11:18.537 --> 11:31.209
I don't know where they get their money, and yet it's very hard to get money to do a straight play, because the returns aren't as big, because you can't run eight or nine or ten years like, you know, it's Phantom of the Opera.

11:31.689 --> 11:37.815
If a play is a hit today, and it runs a year and a half, you've had a big hit.

11:39.247 --> 11:48.136
I wonder, I wonder, I know how hard it is to publish a book for the first time.

11:48.376 --> 11:48.656
Right.

11:49.277 --> 11:55.803
I have to think that getting a play produced has got to be the most intimidating thing in the world.

11:56.364 --> 11:56.584
Yeah.

11:56.604 --> 12:00.107
What do you tell a youngster that comes up to you and says, I want to be a part?

12:00.127 --> 12:08.916
Well, there aren't a lot who come up anymore because they're all aiming to write screenplays, and then they want to drop the screenplays and become a director.

12:09.824 --> 12:23.506
And because even writing films, since I came into it, has changed so much, is that almost there's hardly a writer who can make a contract and say, I can't be rewritten.

12:23.946 --> 12:25.348
If you want rewrites, I'll do it.

12:25.389 --> 12:32.420
They'll say, no, we want to bring in other writers and fix this stuff, because their investment is $70 million, $60 million, something like that.

12:33.081 --> 12:35.224
So I'm

12:35.677 --> 12:38.400
amazed when I hear that there's someone who wants to be a playwright.

12:39.081 --> 12:43.406
I called Stanford University once because I wanted to teach for one year.

12:44.086 --> 12:50.153
And I said, I was looking around what universities I would go to, and I liked the idea of Stanford because I liked where it was.

12:50.173 --> 12:53.137
It was close enough to home, not to be away so long.

12:53.817 --> 12:58.783
And they were overwhelmed, and they said, my God, yes, we would love it.

12:59.283 --> 13:01.446
I said, just tell me how many students you think you can get.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.110
So she called me back in about three days, and she said, we can get five.

13:06.355 --> 13:07.536
Yeah.

13:07.776 --> 13:12.100
And I said, if I was going to teach screenplay writing, how many would I get?

13:12.120 --> 13:13.502
She said, well over 200.

13:15.444 --> 13:17.165
So that's where the world is going.

13:17.185 --> 13:23.031
And if you read the New York Times Magazine section, the world of the future, we're all going to be wiped out by something.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.192
Is that today's terms?

13:24.212 --> 13:24.692
Yeah.

13:24.953 --> 13:26.114
I've been traveling.

13:26.134 --> 13:26.955
I haven't seen it.

13:26.975 --> 13:27.695
My wife has any problem.

13:28.476 --> 13:30.538
The entire issue is dedicated to the future.

13:30.938 --> 13:35.923
Every writer that they have on their staff, or maybe some outside writers, too, talk about the future.

13:36.038 --> 13:38.161
like a hundred years from now.

13:38.421 --> 13:42.847
Well, do you think then that it's an anachronism?

13:42.867 --> 13:45.070
I mean, do you think writing... No, I don't.

13:45.090 --> 13:53.862
I mean, we got this far, you know, since the beginning of drawing on the walls of a cave that I think the great writers will still persist.

13:54.443 --> 13:56.726
I think people will still always want live theater.

13:57.107 --> 13:59.170
The venues will change.

13:59.190 --> 14:01.573
Off-Broadway has a great many plays,

14:02.077 --> 14:07.763
But the plays that are running now, and again, it's only because of dollars, which is what the movie business is about.

14:08.623 --> 14:22.477
The day that I first saw in the New York Times, which has to be well over 10 years ago, I guess, where the New York Times started printing the grosses each weekend of the movies, and I said, it's all over because now it's all about money.

14:23.278 --> 14:25.260
It's not about how good it is.

14:25.820 --> 14:28.523
When you hear people in California talk about a picture,

14:29.127 --> 14:31.430
They rarely talk about the quality of the picture.

14:31.450 --> 14:35.737
They may say it's great or it's bad, but they never talk about what the content is about.

14:36.198 --> 14:40.664
They'll say, did 60 million, and I think it should go through the roof to 100 million.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.647
That's what they talk about.

14:43.468 --> 14:44.350
Now, you said home.

14:44.410 --> 14:45.712
Home now for you is there?

14:45.732 --> 14:54.124
Well, yeah, I live there mostly now because I'm married to Diane, and we have a 12-year-old daughter, and she's in school there.

14:54.565 --> 14:56.388
My two daughters live in Santa Barbara.

14:56.468 --> 14:57.590
One of them is writing screenplays.

14:57.610 --> 14:58.611
Nancy's writing screenplays.

14:58.912 --> 14:59.733
short stories.

15:01.536 --> 15:07.885
So it's easier for me to be there, but this is the department we've been in here for about eight or nine years.

15:08.746 --> 15:11.109
And when I do a play, then I come here and I spend a lot of time.

15:11.850 --> 15:16.537
But I mean, you talk about New York is still... It's home, yeah.

15:17.298 --> 15:17.718
It's New York.

15:17.779 --> 15:18.520
Absolutely.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.943
I'm rooting for the Yankees down in the woods.

15:21.003 --> 15:25.890
I mean, New York, if you'd been out to see New York, it's book country on Fifth Avenue.

15:26.311 --> 15:27.332
I know.

15:27.734 --> 15:30.197
Oh, there's some people out there.

15:30.217 --> 15:31.398
Well, that's what's great.

15:31.458 --> 15:31.919
L.A.?

15:31.939 --> 15:32.179
No.

15:33.400 --> 15:33.841
Forget it.

15:33.921 --> 15:37.945
There were some good bookstores in L.A., but you can't find them anymore.

15:38.426 --> 15:42.330
Well, the big ones, Brentano's.

15:42.431 --> 15:45.254
I did a signing out there in February.

15:46.295 --> 15:48.237
I sent 450 bookstores.

15:48.878 --> 15:50.720
Oh, you mean in a number of places?

15:51.000 --> 15:51.721
No, one place.

15:51.741 --> 15:52.242
In one place?

15:52.262 --> 15:54.124
It was the Antiquarian Book Fair.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.345
I signed for a whole weekend.

15:55.831 --> 16:02.722
And, no, but it was book collectors, you know, they were coming and they were buying my books and they were sitting ducks for me, you know, but, but.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.404
But it's this one book you're talking about.

16:04.424 --> 16:08.511
This book, yeah, it's fancy.

16:09.853 --> 16:16.183
You know, but really, you'd never see anything like this, any place that I could think of.

16:16.203 --> 16:22.733
I mean, even Boston, as literate a community as Boston is, just thousands and thousands of people out there.

16:23.033 --> 16:26.879
walking up and down just out of interest in the book.

16:26.899 --> 16:27.520
That's true.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.384
Yes, it's really wonderful.

16:30.405 --> 16:36.314
It took me eight years to write my book.

16:36.414 --> 16:42.584
And, you know, you write it, and you say, Jesus, what a hell he likes it.

16:42.604 --> 16:45.548
And finally, you know, it gets out, and you wait for the reviews.

16:45.929 --> 16:48.012
I have to think that as a playwright, though,

16:48.565 --> 16:49.426
You get that.

16:49.446 --> 16:50.348
It's like a musician.

16:50.728 --> 16:55.636
You know instantly if the audience likes it or if they don't like it, don't you?

16:55.656 --> 16:57.039
Not with the book, with the play.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.785
I'm saying by contrast to the book.

17:01.105 --> 17:01.426
Right.

17:01.446 --> 17:05.032
I know that on the first night that we show it in front of an audience, what that reaction is.

17:05.512 --> 17:12.163
I mean, it may not be totally accurate, but you can tell by the end of that first week that this audience loves this play.

17:12.403 --> 17:15.889
It doesn't mean that the critics will, but it makes me feel good about the play.

17:16.156 --> 17:27.373
But a book, I mean, once it got around to some of my friends, it would trickle in because it takes them a few days to read it if they even had devoted to it.

17:28.094 --> 17:31.720
You get a phone call here, you get another phone call there.

17:32.842 --> 17:33.903
So it's a different process.

17:34.344 --> 17:39.972
I guess I'm actually asking about writing a play for performance.

17:40.613 --> 17:44.239
And, you know, it's one reason I still write for newspapers.

17:44.405 --> 17:50.092
I'll write something tomorrow, and I'll see it in print in a couple days, and I'll know if it's a bust.

17:50.692 --> 17:52.575
I mean, if I messed it up, I'll hear.

17:52.995 --> 17:54.276
If people like it, I'll hear.

17:54.417 --> 18:01.645
You know, that is one of the nice things about waiting for the papers, is you do get that immediate feedback.

18:01.685 --> 18:04.548
But, I mean, I get it eventually, because it takes a long time.

18:04.609 --> 18:08.833
I'm doing a new play the next summer that I've been on for five years.

18:08.874 --> 18:11.897
It doesn't mean I've been on all the time, but it's been

18:12.333 --> 18:22.503
a lot of rewrites, and then I wrote it as a film, and then a number of studios wanted to buy it, and I said, oh, they're anxious for it, and I think I'll go back and do it as a play, and now I have more faith in it.

18:22.903 --> 18:25.946
So I have to wait a long time until I'm going to get that first reaction.

18:25.966 --> 18:41.901
You know, because you've been so private about yourself over the years, which I respect, I guess I never, and I've seen all of the movies and the number of the plays, and I guess I never realized how much of yourself

18:42.674 --> 18:51.987
Yeah, I did, even though I changed the facts around a lot.

18:52.007 --> 18:59.237
For example, something like Brighton Beach Memoirs, which in the play, it's my family taking in my mother's sister and their two daughters.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.139
In real life, it was the opposite.

19:01.500 --> 19:09.070
My parents broke up, and my mother and I went to live with a cousin, and my brother went to live with an aunt.

19:09.421 --> 19:14.869
I'm not interested in making these plays autobiographical, and they know what my life is about.

19:14.889 --> 19:18.114
The creative process is such that you are taking elements from your own life.

19:18.134 --> 19:18.995
Yeah, I have to, yes.

19:19.216 --> 19:23.963
But I've done it in about nine of the 29 plays I've done, but that's a lot.

19:24.684 --> 19:26.126
I think so, yeah.

19:26.146 --> 19:32.916
I mean, some that I consider autobiographical aren't even about me, like the odd couple is about my brother and a good friend of ours.

19:35.099 --> 19:38.905
But, I don't know, I seem to know it so well.

19:39.104 --> 19:44.730
Sometimes I can make a mistake in geography and not get the play right.

19:44.770 --> 19:48.894
For example, I wrote a play that was not very successful, and I didn't like it very much.

19:48.915 --> 19:50.416
It was called Star Spangled Girl.

19:50.857 --> 19:55.762
But it came from, well, if you read the book, you know it came from that Patty Chiafstein meeting with this woman.

19:56.823 --> 20:08.976
Had I written with a conversation on that level, plus written the play, Star Spangled Girl, and said it in New York, it would have been a better play.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.504
because I would know where the people went to and where they came back.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.267
I was writing about San Francisco where I had never been.

20:15.768 --> 20:17.270
It's like writing in a vacuum.

20:17.510 --> 20:19.413
And it's absolutely wrong for me.

20:19.833 --> 20:21.756
And I did a play in London Suite.

20:23.198 --> 20:24.740
The first play took place in England.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.901
They all took place in England.

20:26.101 --> 20:33.771
But it was about two Englishmen, a writer and his business manager, who robbed him of all of his money.

20:34.352 --> 20:36.114
And he brings him up to this hotel to kill him.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.056
And ultimately he doesn't.

20:37.116 --> 20:38.638
It just humiliates him.

20:38.658 --> 20:38.878
But

20:39.365 --> 20:47.897
It was tough going here because I was keeping so close to the English idiom, which I can write sometimes well.

20:49.118 --> 20:52.203
But had I made that in American play, it would have been much better.

20:52.223 --> 20:54.205
It was one of four one-act plays.

20:55.407 --> 21:01.115
Do you have a sense of who you're writing for, who the audience is?

21:01.275 --> 21:03.118
Well, it depends what medium you're writing for.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.101
I have no sense if I write for television.

21:05.201 --> 21:06.182
None.

21:06.770 --> 21:09.073
22 million people out there.

21:09.113 --> 21:10.455
You can't see them, you know.

21:10.475 --> 21:17.083
I was able to be in the garage someplace, you know, drinking beer, and I had no idea what they want to see.

21:17.103 --> 21:19.186
And it's generally not what I want to write.

21:20.428 --> 21:22.611
With a movie, it comes down.

21:22.671 --> 21:23.632
The numbers come down.

21:24.133 --> 21:26.055
But again, that's spread out over the country.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.840
When I think about my plays, I don't think where they'll ultimately be.

21:29.980 --> 21:36.068
I'll think of New York with a thousand people in the audience that night and a tough audience, too.

21:37.010 --> 21:42.078
And if it goes well there, then I feel like I've done well with it.

21:42.599 --> 21:43.861
So that's who I picture.

21:44.542 --> 21:50.552
And I can picture some of the critics, but that's pointless, because you can never have cast the critics.

21:50.572 --> 21:53.016
Do you make yourself laugh?

21:53.978 --> 21:59.847
Well, when I'm writing it, at the moment that it happens, some things will make me laugh.

21:59.987 --> 22:03.132
Others, I just... I like it.

22:03.193 --> 22:04.114
I mean, there was a time...

22:04.482 --> 22:12.831
when I would write a line like The Art Couple, and I said, God, this is going to be a humongous laugh, which it was.

22:13.671 --> 22:17.115
I stumbled on it.

22:19.517 --> 22:28.347
But people who lived with me, like Joan and Marsha Mason and now Diane, said they walked by my door and they hear me mumbling.

22:29.127 --> 22:33.612
So I'm talking aloud as I'm writing, mostly, oh, not on this book,

22:34.081 --> 22:40.710
Only when I'm doing it for plays, because I want to hear what it sounds like in the mouths of the actors, if you can hear it.

22:41.331 --> 22:42.552
So you do that with all the plays?

22:42.953 --> 22:43.133
Yeah.

22:43.614 --> 22:44.335
I don't realize it.

22:44.355 --> 22:47.158
I try to keep it low, but they hear me mumbling away.

22:47.539 --> 22:50.943
But it doesn't happen when I'm doing this, because I'm not reading it aloud for somebody.

22:50.963 --> 22:53.367
Do you visualize it in performance, too?

22:53.507 --> 22:53.907
Oh, yeah.

22:53.927 --> 22:54.568
Do you see it?

22:54.688 --> 22:58.313
And why it's easier for me to write for the theater, which isn't for most people.

22:58.373 --> 23:01.978
Most writers I know would rather write if it's not a book.

23:02.262 --> 23:04.405
they would rather write for the screen.

23:04.945 --> 23:12.374
But what I picture in the audience, I don't care what seat you're sitting in, way over the side, this side, upstairs, there's still that proscenium.

23:12.795 --> 23:21.846
So that's the view you're gonna get, whereas the film, they come in, they shoot from this side, from above, underneath, not even that character, they're on this character.

23:21.866 --> 23:25.210
And in that editing process, they break up the music.

23:26.531 --> 23:32.218
I write, I always hear a certain kind of music, not literal music, but the music of the words.

23:32.958 --> 23:51.437
and there's a certain flow to them, and I've had actors like Jack Lemmon say, he said, it's odd, it doesn't happen with hardly any writer that he works with, but if you leave out an and, an if, or a but, he says, it doesn't make much difference to the speech, but when you hear it, something is missing.

23:52.338 --> 23:55.681
So, uh... And Lemmon is quite a cerebral... Oh, yeah.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.683
...can really articulate the craft.

23:57.743 --> 23:59.125
He can, yeah, he's wonderful.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.408
Well, Mercedes' rule, when we're doing Lost in Young,

24:02.742 --> 24:03.363
came to me.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.665
What's your schedule?

24:05.685 --> 24:06.486
Pardon me?

24:06.506 --> 24:07.707
Yeah, I have a full 6.15.

24:07.727 --> 24:08.528
Okay.

24:09.709 --> 24:30.589
Mercedes came to me when we were in previews with Lost in Young, and she said, and we had done the play for six or eight weeks on the road, really, four weeks in University of North Carolina and then in Washington, and she said, I beg of you, Neil, if you would just take this one line out of the speech, because I think it hurts what she's trying to say, and it

24:31.008 --> 24:38.737
She gave me about five different reasons, and I said, Mercedes, try it tonight, and, you know, if you're more comfortable with it, then fine, we'll leave it out.

24:39.177 --> 24:42.141
So she did the speech that night, and she didn't take the line out.

24:43.102 --> 24:45.004
And I came to her, and I said, why don't you take it out?

24:45.024 --> 24:45.985
And she said, I missed it.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.408
She says, I felt the music was wrong.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.629
That's wonderful.

24:50.230 --> 24:55.576
That must make you feel... Well, you feel wonderful about that, yes.

24:55.817 --> 25:00.542
You say in the book that you've really only written two plays with a specific actor.

25:01.147 --> 25:04.312
No, I don't think any plays.

25:04.512 --> 25:09.459
Walter Matthau was in my mind, but I didn't know I would get it when I was writing the article.

25:09.579 --> 25:10.901
It's two films.

25:11.221 --> 25:12.403
I'm sorry, two films.

25:12.423 --> 25:12.984
Two films.

25:13.144 --> 25:17.190
That you've actually written with the actors in mind that I knew I would get.

25:17.230 --> 25:17.951
That's right.

25:18.151 --> 25:20.415
Because it's pointless to write for an actor.

25:21.656 --> 25:26.343
Because someone said to me, when you're doing a film, you're only going to do it for these two actors.

25:26.784 --> 25:29.888
But when you're writing a play, you're hoping 50 years from now they'll be

25:30.290 --> 25:32.212
all kinds of people doing this play.

25:32.312 --> 25:47.749
So you tend to think much more of the character as a real character when you're doing it as a play than I do when I'm writing a film, which sometimes can hurt it, because I'm thinking of a personality.

25:48.190 --> 25:58.120
Because I know, especially in this day and age, that if I go to a studio with a film that I'm writing, they're going to say, well, we're limited to the kinds of actors we can get for this part.

25:58.160 --> 25:58.761
We can't get

25:59.348 --> 26:09.820
a box office actor for this, so they're not as interested in that film as much, which may change your mind about the kind of movie you want to do.

26:10.421 --> 26:18.571
That was not the case 25 years ago when a movie cost about $2 million to do or $3 million.

26:18.591 --> 26:20.794
You can't even get a supporting agent for that category.

26:20.814 --> 26:23.357
That's right, yeah.

26:24.398 --> 26:26.200
But when you're writing a play,

26:26.686 --> 26:28.528
Do you still kind of visualize?

26:28.769 --> 26:32.774
Do you have a sense of what the character is?

26:32.794 --> 26:34.576
Is there a generic character in mind?

26:34.596 --> 26:35.437
Yeah, there is.

26:35.518 --> 26:35.938
There is.

26:35.998 --> 26:38.341
And when they come for auditions, you say, that's it.

26:38.401 --> 26:47.773
First, when you see them coming in to read, and you say, oh, God, please let this person read well because it's exactly what I'm looking for in the type.

26:49.356 --> 26:50.958
And it's about 50-50.

26:51.098 --> 26:53.381
It doesn't really work out that much.

26:54.442 --> 26:56.625
The performance takes over of what they do.

26:57.668 --> 26:59.351
There's some wonderful moments in there.

26:59.371 --> 27:03.257
You even tell that story about Dustin Hoffman when he does the graduate thing.

27:03.277 --> 27:04.339
Well, he told me that story.

27:04.359 --> 27:05.400
I would never tell it.

27:05.420 --> 27:06.903
I heard it from someone else.

27:07.243 --> 27:09.627
But she knew immediately, didn't she, was there?

27:09.747 --> 27:11.270
And he knew, I guess.

27:11.290 --> 27:21.887
Well, it's what I wrote later on in the book when I had the opening night of my first play, Come Blow Your Horn, when Joan, who was the most supportive person in the community, and she...

27:22.745 --> 27:28.073
had a fight with me that night, and I realized that she was afraid something was going to change us if it was successful.

27:29.094 --> 27:30.957
And the fact that it was, was wonderful.

27:31.398 --> 27:43.916
And then there was the other side of the coin, how she protected me later on when I did the gingerbread lady, and the man came to the phone from Life magazine, wanted to listen to the review coming in, and she shoved him across the room.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.118
She was small.

27:45.138 --> 27:47.161
I mean, I just cheered for her.

27:48.323 --> 27:48.583
It was great.

27:48.817 --> 27:53.722
My editor, incidentally, Holt is my publisher, lives in Pound Ridge.

27:53.862 --> 27:56.204
Do you still have the property up there?

27:56.344 --> 27:57.706
No, I sold all those.

27:57.846 --> 28:00.608
After she died, I sold it.

28:00.869 --> 28:04.752
That was nice to have that place as you did.

28:05.393 --> 28:12.780
Well, I mean, I was lucky enough to be able to afford it, and I felt so helpless in not being able to do anything for her.

28:13.321 --> 28:17.625
And also because I was just trying to keep things from her.

28:18.466 --> 28:26.558
But still going up and buying that house, I knew she would love to be there, because she thought she would be all right.

28:26.578 --> 28:28.941
The doctors told her she would.

28:28.961 --> 28:30.383
He said, listen, you never can tell.

28:30.443 --> 28:40.558
One doctor said that to me, but the one who did the operation, who was going to do the biopsy on the leg, found it here, and he says, no, no way.

28:40.578 --> 28:44.163
That's 25 years ago, because times have... Oh, yeah.

28:44.303 --> 28:46.887
I don't even think about chemotherapy then.

28:47.187 --> 28:49.489
Whether they would have given it to her or not, I don't know.

28:50.610 --> 28:52.752
I'm sure things would have been treated differently.

28:53.312 --> 28:57.115
Do you have favorites in your works?

28:59.037 --> 29:02.960
Well, I mean, I never understood what favorite may mean.

29:02.980 --> 29:07.924
Do I like the play better, and for what reason do I like that play better?

29:08.525 --> 29:13.609
So it always has to do with that I have a good time doing that play.

29:13.629 --> 29:14.990
Was the writing experience good?

29:15.010 --> 29:16.992
Were the actors that I worked with fun?

29:17.512 --> 29:20.697
I mean, I've done plays where I hated every minute of being there.

29:20.717 --> 29:24.462
I had trouble with the director, and then the play came out all right.

29:25.203 --> 29:29.991
But I think Lost in Yonkers, I think, is the best play that I've written.

29:30.011 --> 29:32.975
But, you know, they're like your children.

29:32.995 --> 29:34.397
You don't favor any.

29:34.417 --> 29:35.699
There are some I disfavor.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.382
I mean, I don't like them.

29:37.402 --> 29:39.645
I felt, God, I really did a lousy job with this.

29:40.346 --> 29:45.814
Not that I could have done a good job, because I think it's written on the wall already about the play.

29:46.182 --> 29:56.615
I feel when I sit down to write a play, I usually say this to myself, if you write this to the best of your ability, how good could it be?

29:57.075 --> 30:03.082
And sometimes the answer is, it could be pretty good, and sometimes it could be incredible.

30:03.863 --> 30:14.316
And so you have to resist the temptation to write the one that's going to be just pretty good, because it's going to be an easier play to write.

30:15.140 --> 30:22.387
I wrote a couple where I knew there wouldn't be hits at all, but I felt the need to write them, which I think I talked about in the book.

30:22.487 --> 30:30.795
One was God's favorite because it was something that would be cathartic for me to get out my anger towards why John died.

30:31.596 --> 30:37.582
And the other was The Good Doctor because I wrote that while John was sick and I had to keep myself busy back then.

30:37.602 --> 30:43.307
That's the professional, and actually the

30:43.658 --> 30:49.384
Well, there's something that happens, and I've never been able to figure it out, too.

30:50.145 --> 30:52.748
Joan was in the bedroom, and I was in this room here.

30:53.108 --> 30:56.011
And the minute I go into that world, I'm in there.

30:57.172 --> 30:59.795
And it has to be broken by something.

30:59.855 --> 31:04.080
I don't just think about what's waiting on the other side.

31:04.300 --> 31:10.307
I knew that, A, if I didn't just keep writing every day, she was going to suspect something.

31:10.367 --> 31:10.967
What's the matter?

31:10.987 --> 31:12.068
Why are you not doing it?

31:12.589 --> 31:13.530
Why aren't you working on it?

31:13.780 --> 31:21.550
And she was making somewhat of a recovery then because the radiation reduced the tumor.

31:21.570 --> 31:24.534
So I thought, gee, maybe we can do all right, and I kept writing.

31:25.255 --> 31:28.339
Do you enter a kind of zone when the writer entered that world?

31:29.160 --> 31:31.343
You mean a figurative one?

31:31.683 --> 31:32.885
Yeah.

31:32.905 --> 31:33.005
Yeah.

31:33.025 --> 31:36.530
I mean, you just mentioned, you just said that, you know, you divorce yourself and what's going on.

31:36.650 --> 31:38.052
Why could there be any place?

31:38.072 --> 31:40.615
I've written in the dentist's office waiting to go in.

31:40.966 --> 31:47.573
Because if I'm driving to get to the dentist's office, my mind is working on the thing that I had been writing that morning.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.857
So I said, oh God, I want to hold on to those couple lines.

31:50.877 --> 31:53.080
So I brought the pad with me or whatever.

31:53.100 --> 31:56.404
Sometimes I just write down a magazine and take it with me.

31:57.004 --> 31:57.985
But I am in a zone.

31:58.786 --> 32:05.314
And I've heard for so long how lonely it is for writers.

32:05.334 --> 32:06.535
I've never felt that.

32:07.358 --> 32:10.322
I've never felt like, God, I'm alone in this room.

32:10.342 --> 32:12.024
I wish there was somebody here with me.

32:12.044 --> 32:14.807
I wish there was someone who was going to call me.

32:14.827 --> 32:17.731
It's just a place I like to be.

32:22.377 --> 32:25.821
Have you ever thought, you know, do you see the plays as a corpus?

32:26.281 --> 32:37.315
I mean, if we really want to know about your life and about you, and you've mentioned 50 years from now, 100 years from now, do you think that anybody who reads your plays

32:37.852 --> 32:40.255
will get a sense of that?

32:40.275 --> 32:40.936
Well, some.

32:41.156 --> 33:00.102
I mean, Patty Chiesky said to me that Prisoner of Second Avenue will give a very clear picture of what New York City and maybe America was like at that particular time, because it's right at the period when the drugs started to proliferate and crime started to hit the big cities, and that's what that play was about.

33:01.144 --> 33:03.006
They were robbed right in their house.

33:03.226 --> 33:07.352
Everything about it was grim, and yet somehow I managed to find some humor in it, too.

33:07.957 --> 33:13.468
the art couple too, I guess, but the art couple is very universal.

33:13.528 --> 33:17.916
I mean, that'll go on for years and years because it's such a universal subject.

33:18.097 --> 33:23.708
And that's a title, actually, like The Right Stuff Can Catch 22, that I think has entered our language.

33:23.728 --> 33:24.209
Oh, it has.

33:24.229 --> 33:25.471
But it was in our language first.

33:26.313 --> 33:27.535
And I just used it

33:27.937 --> 33:32.023
And if something's taken on a new meaning... Yeah, it's really taken on a context.

33:32.103 --> 33:36.950
It has a context that you think of the art couple, you think of the play.

33:37.270 --> 33:39.153
Well, I purposely do that sometimes.

33:39.233 --> 33:46.523
I take things from the language that sometimes sound like something we heard, like Last of the Red Hot Lovers.

33:48.365 --> 33:53.893
That was a play on what Sophie Tuckie used to be called, Last of the Red Hot Mamas.

33:54.110 --> 33:58.337
Since this man was anything but the last of the Red Hot Lovers, he was not a lover at all.

33:58.417 --> 34:00.580
It seemed so an ironic title.

34:00.600 --> 34:14.602
Prisoner of Second Avenue was a good title because it gave a perfect image of what this man was going through because he lost his job at the age of 48 and his wife went out and went back for the job that she used to have that she quit to raise her daughters for.

34:15.363 --> 34:21.433
And he knew how many steps around the corners of the room there were.

34:22.072 --> 34:23.313
So titles are very important.

34:23.373 --> 34:29.681
Sometimes when I don't get a good title, it means I don't know what the name of it, what the play is really about.

34:30.782 --> 34:45.939
I had this title way before I ever wrote the book, because I feel my life is about rewrites, not only in terms of the rewrites I actually do, but the way I've had to rewrite my life based on the circumstances that have happened over.

34:45.960 --> 34:46.760
It's a wonderful quality.

34:48.322 --> 34:51.606
It's distracting me from where I was going with the next thing.

34:52.463 --> 34:57.972
It's the next question.

34:57.992 --> 34:58.372
I'm sorry.

34:58.873 --> 34:59.874
Has that ever happened to you?

35:00.195 --> 35:10.731
You're on a track and it was... I also like the fact, you know, this could almost be a... I've got a primer for prospective players.

35:10.811 --> 35:12.354
That's what Joseph Yachty said.

35:12.374 --> 35:20.867
He said this should be required... Because, you know, it's... People are saying, hey, character...

35:21.640 --> 35:25.526
the dialogue, giving you the sequence of things that come.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.490
Yeah, from the beginning to the end, as I was learning it.

35:28.771 --> 35:30.713
I didn't want to keep it strictly that.

35:30.753 --> 35:32.035
I didn't want to just be that.

35:32.095 --> 35:34.138
No, of course not, but it's not dropping names.

35:35.921 --> 35:37.584
You're not dropping names.

35:37.604 --> 35:39.607
No, they were all part of my learning process.

35:39.627 --> 35:45.335
And I love Jerry Lewis, you know, astounded by the fact that, well, let's cut this, cut this.

35:45.515 --> 35:45.876
He was.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.658
I'll never forget that.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.803
He said, you're the first writer I ever met who didn't mind

35:51.053 --> 35:52.555
cutting something.

35:52.575 --> 35:56.419
And I said, well, why would I want to leave it in when we both know it's not working?

35:56.599 --> 35:57.580
I'm glad to get that.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.202
Well, plus you had to get eight minutes out of that.

35:59.502 --> 36:01.264
Yeah, well, that's the pragmatic thing.

36:01.304 --> 36:07.771
But to find which eight minutes was easy for me, because I had heard it in the rehearsal.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.474
I said, this doesn't work, and this doesn't work.

36:10.494 --> 36:16.521
So as I said at the end of that chapter, I was sure learning about how to rewrite, even though I didn't know how to write yet.

36:16.801 --> 36:20.605
What's funny for me is that you laugh at him despite yourself.

36:21.192 --> 36:22.273
Jerry Lewis.

36:22.453 --> 36:28.880
Right, because I knew it was the lowest common denominator of humor, but it also appealed to that part of Cambridge's life.

36:29.441 --> 36:32.585
And listen, the whole country was a Jerry Lewis fan at that time.

36:32.605 --> 36:34.066
Well, I mean, I'm 53.

36:34.146 --> 36:37.230
I grew up watching Martin and Lewis and all the other stuff.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.211
Yeah, they were pretty funny.

36:38.271 --> 36:38.952
They were funny.

36:38.972 --> 36:44.277
And then, of course, the French, as you point out, are crazy about it.

36:44.297 --> 36:50.344
You know, all these different plays that you've been talking about, there is a poignancy with all of them.

36:50.364 --> 36:51.165
And we're talking about

36:51.432 --> 36:52.674
levels of humor.

36:52.694 --> 36:55.158
Do you have a philosophy on humor?

36:55.178 --> 37:00.426
I mean, is it possible for you to go out and write a very serious drama without any... I doubt it.

37:00.546 --> 37:09.700
I mean, I've thought about that, and people have asked me about that, and I said somehow the humor would come in because I see humor in certain kinds of situations.

37:11.422 --> 37:19.495
I did something at the end of this book which I thought was kind of daring and worried me, but it's what was going on.

37:19.635 --> 37:19.735
I

37:20.035 --> 37:33.488
When I was going to look for the coffin for Joan, I didn't want to be met by somebody who was going to treat me the way I was treated looking for a coffin for my father and for my mother.

37:33.548 --> 37:35.870
It was the third time I had to do it alone.

37:36.531 --> 37:37.972
And so I switched it.

37:38.372 --> 37:46.640
Instead of saying what I did that time for Joan, I switched it to get my anger out about what happened with the man who was showing it to me for my father.

37:47.401 --> 37:48.642
But there was some humor in it.

37:48.858 --> 37:50.941
It's black humor.

37:51.722 --> 37:53.365
But there was a need to put it in.

37:53.625 --> 37:57.992
And sometimes I'm not always aware where the humor is.

37:58.513 --> 37:59.815
In other words, I'm not always writing.

37:59.835 --> 38:03.420
They're not jokes, because if we take them out of context, they're not very funny.

38:04.001 --> 38:11.393
But when Mike Nichols and I were doing Plaza Suite, we were in Boston trying it out at the Colonial.

38:12.094 --> 38:15.439
And we felt that the first piece had some humor in it.

38:15.740 --> 38:23.830
And then it turns dark when the wife finds out that her husband is probably having an affair with the secretary, and in fact he is.

38:25.191 --> 38:31.859
But the things that she said back to him had humor to them, but they weren't jokes.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.063
But we didn't want the audience to laugh, and they kept laughing.

38:35.223 --> 38:43.413
And Mike and I went in, and we started taking out every laugh, and they found other places to laugh, because I think it made them very uncomfortable.

38:43.694 --> 38:45.696
It was a period in this country...

38:46.098 --> 38:57.754
when the company manager of the play, who was the man who was in charge of really helping us sell the tickets and giving theater parties and all, who said, you can't put this play on.

38:58.535 --> 38:59.296
And I said, why not?

38:59.316 --> 39:02.019
He said, well, you know how many men in the audience are sitting there?

39:02.380 --> 39:03.441
They've come from out of town.

39:03.481 --> 39:04.803
They've brought a girl.

39:04.843 --> 39:05.865
They hired for the night.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.246
I said, tough.

39:07.807 --> 39:12.934
I said, I'm not going to worry about what their moral problems are.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.316
But you say that you

39:14.971 --> 39:19.898
You don't, people do ask you about writing a serious, old serious play.

39:19.918 --> 39:20.218
I did.

39:20.238 --> 39:21.180
I mean, God knows.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.723
Lost in Yonkers is a serious play.

39:24.184 --> 39:27.328
There's humor in it that's the strangest kind of humor.

39:27.769 --> 39:33.236
And I thought it was the best character humor that I had, or character writing I had done.

39:33.356 --> 39:39.665
And it was the character of Bella, who was emotionally retarded by the way her mother spilled in her growth.

39:40.466 --> 39:44.792
And so she wants to tell the family

39:45.127 --> 39:49.052
now that she has met somebody that she wants to marry and open a restaurant with.

39:49.452 --> 40:00.545
And he too, this man has much more, I would say, physical problems in terms of his retardation.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.309
And it's so difficult for her to tell them that she's planned it all.

40:03.889 --> 40:06.492
And someone sits down and she goes, no, no, no, you don't sit there.

40:06.512 --> 40:07.914
You sit over here.

40:07.974 --> 40:09.936
And Jack, you have to sit over here.

40:09.977 --> 40:11.899
Audience laughed their way through it.

40:12.099 --> 40:12.940
And it was funny.

40:13.426 --> 40:14.647
I knew it was funny.

40:14.888 --> 40:20.013
I also knew that the sister, I don't know if you saw it, did you ever see it?

40:20.033 --> 40:20.093
No.

40:20.454 --> 40:23.617
All four children are dysfunctional one way or the other.

40:24.138 --> 40:30.225
One of them had a voice problem, which she couldn't breathe properly, mostly because she was nervous around her mother all the time.

40:30.245 --> 40:34.409
So she had to say the words either on the intake or the outtake.

40:34.429 --> 40:36.251
It was on the out breath, I guess.

40:36.632 --> 40:38.093
I didn't know that.

40:38.974 --> 40:40.115
She would talk like that.

40:40.576 --> 40:41.577
Audiences would laugh.

40:42.164 --> 40:55.581
and I knew they would laugh, and I knew that it was disrespectful to laugh at it, and I think they felt guilty about it, and I think that's what the duty of a playwright is, is sometimes to make the audience uncomfortable about something.

40:56.843 --> 41:00.708
But that's not necessarily what makes a hit, because they don't want to feel uncomfortable.

41:00.728 --> 41:08.998
They don't want you to do that in a play, and yet that became the most successful play for me, in terms of praise, I guess.

41:09.873 --> 41:13.056
Because you don't spend a lot of time on the TV years.

41:13.136 --> 41:16.180
That was the training for you.

41:16.200 --> 41:16.500
Yeah.

41:17.061 --> 41:20.885
Well, first of all, I did do it in a play, Laughter on the 23rd Floor.

41:20.965 --> 41:29.734
And as I try to do in the structure of this book is, when I'm up to a play, then I'll go and talk about what it led up to, or what led up to it.

41:30.014 --> 41:38.023
So when I'm writing about Bath in the Park, I have to proceed it with, Joan and I lived in this apartment, which was five flights up, and so-and-so then comes the play.

41:38.476 --> 41:42.803
But then the art couple, I talk about Danny, me, Roy Gerber, and I get divorced, and so on.

41:42.823 --> 41:45.166
So then comes my writing about the play.

41:45.607 --> 41:55.001
So when I come to writing about laughter on the 23rd floor in the next book, which would be way near the end of the book, I'd go back and talk about the television days.

41:55.442 --> 42:01.831
Because that's what, it was strange to me when I wrote the play, and I said, God, this was 40 years ago, and I was working with these guys.

42:02.292 --> 42:03.934
But this is the time to do the play.

42:06.198 --> 42:07.099
I know you get to,

42:07.636 --> 42:12.162
If you're through, fine.

42:12.182 --> 42:13.985
This is great stuff.

42:16.048 --> 42:17.049
I have no one else coming.

42:17.189 --> 42:21.775
My wife and I are just getting ready to go to dinner in the past 15 minutes.

42:21.795 --> 42:22.556
I'm getting dressed.

42:25.841 --> 42:26.442
Okay.

42:26.462 --> 42:34.673
You know there was a point, you mentioned in the book, a regional theater has kind of, I am interested in the advice that you'd give to a,

42:34.889 --> 42:38.112
a young playwright, and you say, but they're identity, they all want to be screeners.

42:38.132 --> 42:40.275
Yeah, no, but that's, I don't mean that.

42:40.295 --> 42:43.598
But the kid comes up and says, gee, Mr. Senator, are you really serious?

42:43.698 --> 42:59.114
If they're really serious about writing plays and knowing that they're not going to make much money in it, and unless they became successful, then the only advice is you just have to do it out of your own passion and need to do it.

42:59.134 --> 42:59.935
There's no general

43:00.438 --> 43:03.761
advice you give in terms of the writing itself.

43:03.801 --> 43:05.783
Try to write a play about such and such.

43:06.223 --> 43:08.365
Make sure you don't do this when you're writing.

43:08.785 --> 43:10.767
There's nothing, I mean, you have to go your own way.

43:11.208 --> 43:14.691
I broke a lot of rules and laws when I first started doing it.

43:14.711 --> 43:24.059
I asked this question to Edward Albee once, and he said, I asked him, first of all, he advises against trying to be a playwright, and then he says, well, if you can't live without it.

43:24.079 --> 43:26.401
Well, that's what I meant, by the passion.

43:26.421 --> 43:28.723
That's right, and then he said, in that case, I'll

43:29.159 --> 43:33.644
give you the best advice than I can, but the passion has to be there.

43:33.925 --> 43:34.686
Exactly, yeah.

43:34.706 --> 43:37.949
You have to feel that I can't live without trying this, without doing this.

43:37.969 --> 43:45.578
Well, I try to sometimes discourage someone, and I said, if I can discourage you and you'll quit, then you aren't meant to be a playwright.

43:45.879 --> 43:48.162
Then you say, no, I'm going to do it anyway.

43:48.182 --> 43:57.833
So I know what the odds are, and this is not a country anymore, a civilization, as it is in Europe as much, where the theater is the

43:58.015 --> 43:59.837
primary source of entertainment.

44:01.479 --> 44:06.464
You have to realize it's all about movies and television now, and you still want to do it, and you must do it.

44:06.524 --> 44:07.245
Now, you're a writer.

44:07.865 --> 44:12.070
When you write, it's different for me.

44:12.090 --> 44:15.153
Do you think of people reading what you write at any point?

44:15.614 --> 44:16.334
Reading the plays?

44:16.414 --> 44:17.556
Yeah.

44:17.576 --> 44:18.557
Like we read Shakespeare.

44:18.577 --> 44:22.801
They probably read them now more than see them, because it's easier for them to get it.

44:23.162 --> 44:26.385
They could either get the Samuel French editions, or it's published by

44:26.618 --> 44:30.483
It was Randon House, Hussain and Schuster will do it.

44:30.503 --> 44:34.207
So they do read them, but they have readings of them themselves.

44:34.568 --> 44:38.553
There's a man, Senator Alan Simpson, from Wyoming, who's just retired.

44:39.874 --> 44:53.290
I knew him, I know him, and his wife has a group in Wyoming, and they get all the plays from Samuel, French, or wherever, and they have a group of men and women, they sit around the living room and they read the plays, each take a part.

44:54.812 --> 44:56.254
But as a whiter,

44:56.538 --> 45:03.766
It never seemed that you were motivated to write, to be a writer for hard covers, shall we say.

45:03.846 --> 45:06.108
No, no, no.

45:06.128 --> 45:07.970
That's how I spent my youth, reading books.

45:07.990 --> 45:17.280
I mean, I read tons of books, but... I'm just wondering how it happened that you never even... I was just bitten by the theater.

45:17.561 --> 45:26.410
The theater was so glamorous then, back in the 50s when I was going, and even in the 40s, there'd be

45:27.132 --> 45:31.358
30 plays on Broadway, and every year they'd be just all new plays.

45:31.378 --> 45:38.007
And you went to see the good ones and the bad ones, and I was slowly learning about it, even though I didn't know that that's what I was going to do.

45:38.568 --> 45:42.734
Blown away when the first time I saw Streetcar Named Desire with Brandon.

45:42.754 --> 45:45.157
And I said, wow, they broke through all the rules.

45:45.758 --> 45:48.001
There's a guy who's mumbling up on the stage.

45:48.021 --> 45:52.988
And I said, those are people I know on the street, but I never, you have to have good diction to be in the theater.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.342
at that in the first day.

45:55.462 --> 45:57.445
I love to read Tennessee Williams.

45:57.465 --> 46:03.555
I think that... Oh, well, he's a poet, so... I mean, he would take such care of these stage directions.

46:03.835 --> 46:05.498
Yeah, that's true.

46:05.518 --> 46:07.401
And you would never see that in performance.

46:08.462 --> 46:11.908
I'm thinking of Sweetwater View, for instance, this is a brilliant opening.

46:12.368 --> 46:13.871
He is my favorite.

46:13.891 --> 46:16.495
I have everything he did in that first thing.

46:16.515 --> 46:19.880
I'm going to ask you to inscribe this for me.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.743
Would you do that for me?

46:22.921 --> 46:24.948
I have a pen right here.

46:25.068 --> 46:26.313
I hope there's ink left in it.

46:26.534 --> 46:27.657
Oh, I can go get mine.

46:27.678 --> 46:30.006
I guess I kind of used a ton of it right there.

46:31.190 --> 46:32.033
I'll shut this up.

46:32.053 --> 46:32.695
It's really good.

46:32.715 --> 46:35.023
Now, I went up with the signing of the book.
