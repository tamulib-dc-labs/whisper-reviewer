00:02.309 --> 00:05.853
You live in what you say is called a San Francisco flat.

00:06.173 --> 00:06.414
Right.

00:06.434 --> 00:06.954
Which is what?

00:06.974 --> 00:07.975
It's like a full house?

00:08.476 --> 00:11.760
It's the one floor of a house.

00:12.701 --> 00:19.008
Matter of fact, I live on that floor of that building.

00:19.048 --> 00:20.089
That's the third floor.

00:20.470 --> 00:22.392
Right.

00:22.412 --> 00:32.063
So, you know, deciding whether to take the books upstairs or not was kind of...

00:33.393 --> 00:36.157
My preference was to put them in the basement here.

00:36.477 --> 00:38.279
And this sign was right outside your door?

00:38.299 --> 00:38.600
Right there.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.623
Right there.

00:42.485 --> 00:42.585
Wow.

00:42.605 --> 00:45.669
And that was—there were several—I've asked around.

00:45.709 --> 00:49.094
There were others around town, but that one happened to be right outside my door.

00:49.114 --> 00:51.096
And what district of the city do you live in?

00:51.216 --> 00:57.124
That's the—I guess they call it the Panhandle.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.366
Oh, you're in the Panhandle.

00:59.748 --> 01:01.510
See, that's Golden Gate Park down there.

01:04.409 --> 01:12.297
Right near Golden Gate, aren't they?

01:12.317 --> 01:12.417
Yeah.

01:12.437 --> 01:12.537
Okay.

01:12.557 --> 01:14.799
And which of these materials can I take with me?

01:14.819 --> 01:16.621
You can take, no, let's see.

01:16.681 --> 01:17.862
This one I do.

01:20.285 --> 01:21.406
This one I do.

01:22.186 --> 01:23.287
And this is the code.

01:25.069 --> 01:26.691
And this.

01:26.711 --> 01:32.757
This is, these are just all the books with one copy remaining all kind of gathered together.

01:32.937 --> 01:34.078
Yeah, in the system.

01:34.278 --> 01:36.460
Right.

01:36.480 --> 01:52.014
And then this is a kind of study I made of, and a report I made of the books, which I hope is lucid.

01:52.054 --> 02:03.424
I've given that around in a lot of, I've handed it around as much as I could during the Library Association Convention here, whatever you called it.

02:04.568 --> 02:06.410
Well, this is terrific, actually.

02:06.430 --> 02:10.033
Yeah, I tried to summarize it.

02:10.053 --> 02:16.399
Can you just tell me a little bit about your—you said you were involved in social research and all kinds of things.

02:16.479 --> 02:20.062
I mean, this clearly is the work of a professional woman.

02:20.082 --> 02:32.213
I mean, it's a—this is not a haphazard— No, I pulled on my rusty old skills to do that.

02:34.100 --> 02:48.780
Well, I studied sociology and did some graduate work at the University of Chicago, and then worked on various research projects, coding questionnaires, as I came on.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.182
For various foundations?

02:50.202 --> 03:03.280
Yeah, well, at the University of Chicago I worked for the social science research something.

03:03.833 --> 03:09.701
And then I worked for the American Jewish Committee in New York City on a study years ago.

03:09.762 --> 03:12.686
It's fascinating about people's attitudes towards doctors.

03:15.730 --> 03:19.035
They were having trouble then.

03:19.456 --> 03:25.164
But most of my employment as a social researcher was here.

03:25.224 --> 03:32.254
I worked in Berkeley on an aging study, geriatrics.

03:33.145 --> 03:33.926
This is when?

03:34.727 --> 03:39.815
That was, let's see, in the early sixties.

03:40.676 --> 03:48.227
And then I worked at Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Clinic, a sub-study.

03:48.447 --> 03:52.393
Again, it was geriatrics research.

03:52.413 --> 03:54.496
But this is sort of interviewing people.

03:54.576 --> 03:55.517
My wife did something.

03:55.537 --> 03:58.822
Yeah, interviewing people, long interviews, ten-hour interviews.

03:58.962 --> 04:03.068
She did an Alzheimer's project for Cornell.

04:03.537 --> 04:04.940
in front of the project.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.503
There's actually still a quarter.

04:07.124 --> 04:09.488
She worked in it for about five years or so.

04:09.889 --> 04:11.252
They're doing interviews.

04:11.272 --> 04:12.334
Panel studies?

04:12.755 --> 04:12.955
Yeah.

04:13.035 --> 04:21.732
It's called the Caregivers Project, the people who give what it's like for the person who takes care of the family member with Alzheimer's.

04:21.931 --> 04:28.600
I guess they got money to do it, and what they'll ever do with the data is, you know, news to us.

04:28.780 --> 04:31.584
Well, they would periodically put out papers.

04:31.664 --> 04:33.988
I put out a paper with Marjorie Lonefall.

04:34.048 --> 04:34.909
She was the director.

04:36.070 --> 04:39.355
Some, you know, little slice of the data.

04:40.497 --> 04:50.250
They had these huge computers, you know, and they'd run out content analyses and things like that on them.

04:50.568 --> 04:58.977
politically active things, the war, the, you know, this was a pretty interesting part of the world.

04:59.177 --> 04:59.637
Oh, yeah.

04:59.717 --> 05:03.942
Well, some of the tapes that went were taped.

05:04.122 --> 05:09.908
I spent a lot of time out in the streets running around with people and hollering.

05:10.088 --> 05:12.731
I mean, we're talking in the sixties now, right?

05:12.771 --> 05:13.932
Well, not in the sixties.

05:14.012 --> 05:16.294
I was raising a child in the sixties.

05:16.314 --> 05:20.018
The only thing I did in the sixties was I went on one march and I interviewed everybody.

05:20.302 --> 05:21.925
I tried to walk faster or slower.

05:21.945 --> 05:23.587
So you were being a professional woman at the time.

05:23.607 --> 05:26.391
Yeah, I was just checking out, why are you marching?

05:26.572 --> 05:27.553
How did you hear about it?

05:32.280 --> 05:46.883
But then, I think it was in the late 70s, my kid was getting to be a teenager and I was sitting biting my nails and about climbing the walls over

05:46.947 --> 05:55.135
I felt, sitting alone in this room and thinking, this is insane, I've got to do something about this insanity.

05:56.116 --> 05:59.719
And I joined a group, and I hate groups, but I joined a group.

06:01.781 --> 06:15.334
We met every week, and we devised, we became affiliated with another group, and so we were part of the nuclear freeze movement before it became the nuclear freeze movement.

06:15.922 --> 06:25.632
So it basically started with anti-nuclear concerns, although there was a strike when I was still working at UC.

06:25.713 --> 06:29.497
There was a strike at Student Days of Protest.

06:30.097 --> 06:40.869
I don't know what it was about, but we took over all of the compute—we used all the equipment just for what we wanted to say instead of what the organization wanted to say.

06:42.711 --> 06:44.713
That was kind of fun.

06:47.022 --> 06:56.574
One of the phrases Coulter used today was, he says he, by the way, is a liberal Democrat.

06:56.914 --> 06:58.015
Well, liberals.

06:58.816 --> 07:03.502
But then he described the gadflies as lefties.

07:04.083 --> 07:08.428
I said, Jesus, I haven't heard that word in ages, you know, to describe.

07:08.448 --> 07:11.612
But he was throwing this into the discourse, you know.

07:12.757 --> 07:20.586
like your left-wing, radical, agitating type groups who are looking for a cause.

07:20.986 --> 07:25.471
They suggested, perhaps, that there's no war to fight.

07:26.632 --> 07:32.058
Maybe this is the cause du jour, that kind of thing.

07:32.078 --> 07:33.059
How do you respond to that?

07:33.079 --> 07:34.801
Because he basically suggested that.

07:35.722 --> 07:40.367
He's fishing, because the fact is that it's a very disparate group of people.

07:41.090 --> 07:45.176
And there may be some people who have radical backgrounds.

07:45.276 --> 07:46.918
That's a very good point.

07:46.938 --> 07:48.180
That's excellent.

07:48.200 --> 07:48.901
He doesn't know it.

07:48.961 --> 07:50.403
He doesn't know where we're coming from.

07:51.164 --> 07:52.005
That's a very good point.

07:52.025 --> 08:00.136
You know, there's a couple of people who are pro-labor.

08:00.897 --> 08:06.405
There's some that I haven't figured out yet that I'm wary of because I think when

08:06.740 --> 08:17.131
You know, if I was to sit down with this group of people and start making really serious objections to the computers, we'd fall apart.

08:17.812 --> 08:25.860
There are people there that are, you know, I just don't know where they're coming from.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.382
And they're not, they're not.

08:28.303 --> 08:29.704
It's not a political thing.

08:30.044 --> 08:31.186
No.

08:31.306 --> 08:32.807
I think it's an ethical thing.

08:32.948 --> 08:34.509
It's an ethical thing about books.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.291
A cultural thing, an intellectual thing.

08:37.132 --> 08:49.084
It's partly, there is, and it was created by Coler, there is an outrage about the subversion of the democratic process, which is what he did.

08:50.246 --> 09:06.042
So people are almost unanimously enraged at the feeling that their legitimate concerns are being misinterpreted

09:07.102 --> 09:11.388
And treated with contempt.

09:12.810 --> 09:17.997
And in fact, that got said to him in his face by Tilly Olsen, for one.

09:18.017 --> 09:19.219
I'm seeing Tilly tomorrow, by the way.

09:19.399 --> 09:21.121
Oh, well, she's a radical.

09:21.902 --> 09:23.404
I love Tilly.

09:23.464 --> 09:25.728
I got her book today, Silences.

09:26.388 --> 09:31.035
I called her to arrange today, and she said to me, I'm reading your book, my book.

09:31.315 --> 09:32.557
And she said, I'm loving it.

09:32.657 --> 09:34.780
I said, well... She's a dear.

09:34.945 --> 09:38.188
I said, well, I'm reading your book and loving it.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.532
I said, we'll have a nice conversation tomorrow.

09:41.552 --> 09:46.978
Yeah, she really gave it to him, because he had said something.

09:46.998 --> 09:47.758
I don't want to get it.

09:47.778 --> 09:54.485
Well, she may be a radical, but her credentials are so impeccable.

09:54.505 --> 09:55.166
She's a writer.

09:55.647 --> 10:00.091
She's a person who uses collections.

10:00.272 --> 10:01.112
She loves libraries.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.674
She's self-educated.

10:02.958 --> 10:17.820
And she produces, she contributes to our culture, and she discovers that they've raped us, you know, that they've stripped the collection.

10:18.140 --> 10:23.268
And that's a pretty tough one, too.

10:23.288 --> 10:25.311
And he was really fishing today.

10:25.612 --> 10:29.337
I'm sure you've been talking to this when he's trying to

10:30.464 --> 10:33.107
get me to confirm, you know, who I've been talking to.

10:33.127 --> 10:37.353
And I said, Mr. Coulter, I want to tell you, I'm really, I'm talking to everyone.

10:38.534 --> 10:43.500
I said, everyone, I mean, everyone I can talk to this week, and I'll probably have to come back.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.201
I hope I don't.

10:44.762 --> 10:49.608
I mean, I want to come back, but I'd love to get sufficient information and write this chapter.

10:49.648 --> 10:50.830
This is one chapter in the book.

10:52.372 --> 10:57.518
I said, you know, don't, don't, don't, don't,

10:58.105 --> 10:58.686
hurt yourself.

10:58.706 --> 11:01.492
I'm sorry, I'm getting a little inarticulating on myself.

11:02.854 --> 11:06.041
I said, I'm really trying to talk to everybody, yourself included.

11:06.241 --> 11:10.329
Ken Dow and Gina, you know, I want to talk to everybody.

11:11.752 --> 11:13.516
And he already knows.

11:14.237 --> 11:19.287
He said, I know you're going over there Wednesday and you're going to see, apparently you've requested to see Brooks Hall.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.209
I said, not apparently, I have.

11:23.069 --> 11:26.273
And I said, I intend to see it.

11:26.373 --> 11:29.916
I said, TV cameras are gone in there, and I'm writing a book.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.479
I said, I think it's essential that I see it.

11:32.499 --> 11:34.000
It's absolutely part of the story.

11:34.881 --> 11:35.662
I went in there once.

11:35.982 --> 11:37.504
I got caught.

11:37.524 --> 11:38.765
I went in with a truck.

11:38.925 --> 11:42.629
Up goes the gate, truck goes in, and I walk along with the truck.

11:42.649 --> 11:47.434
And I go in, and it was the day after they had put the old card catalog.

11:47.819 --> 11:48.660
in Brooks Hall.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.663
They had finally brought it over from the Old Main.

11:50.683 --> 11:54.227
It was getting ready to be scuttled, and it was saved, right?

11:54.588 --> 11:54.928
Right, right.

11:55.409 --> 12:01.036
Nicholson Baker saved it by filing a suit and turned them into public records, and then they couldn't get rid of them.

12:01.076 --> 12:04.881
They were going to sell them along with all the other stuff they sold.

12:05.763 --> 12:15.295
I have pictures here of the—this is one of the murals in the Old Main.

12:15.545 --> 12:16.727
These were auctioned off.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.509
This was lot number 107.

12:18.530 --> 12:26.442
This is one of the card catalogs from the other library.

12:26.862 --> 12:31.269
What they did was they put them together with whole lots of furniture.

12:33.512 --> 12:38.860
There would be one card catalog and then six decks and twenty-five chairs and stuff.

12:39.682 --> 12:43.948
And if there wasn't a card catalog in one of those lots,

12:44.485 --> 12:45.286
There'd be no bid.

12:45.346 --> 12:47.390
They didn't advertise the thing.

12:47.710 --> 12:50.435
They only made $7,500 on all of the furniture.

12:51.877 --> 13:06.180
And most of it they made on the... Well, I'd say they averaged between $20 and $100 for one of these card cabinets.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.345
Yeah, that's it.

13:09.781 --> 13:22.795
It's very sad, because if they hadn't auctioned them off, here's the main card catalog part of it.

13:23.535 --> 13:25.257
That's the one that they moved to Brooks Hall.

13:25.277 --> 13:27.079
That's the one that Nicholson Baker saved.

13:28.481 --> 13:29.522
And you'll see it down there.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.504
I'll take some pictures.

13:33.866 --> 13:34.947
Yeah.

13:34.967 --> 13:39.332
So these are just one card catalog after another that they auctioned off.

13:40.004 --> 13:41.206
You took a lot of pictures.

13:41.246 --> 13:42.367
So what happened?

13:42.387 --> 13:45.271
Did they tell you to leave?

13:45.571 --> 13:48.315
Well, I noticed they were watching me.

13:53.021 --> 13:55.485
No, they let me go on taking the pictures of that.

13:55.665 --> 13:59.070
But at the auction, they held the auction.

13:59.190 --> 14:00.572
It was surreal.

14:01.213 --> 14:04.577
They held the auction at the top of the main staircase.

14:05.806 --> 14:08.771
on the balcony, and then the stairs go down like this.

14:08.851 --> 14:13.398
And so the auctioneers were at the far end, and everybody was strung along these pillars.

14:13.999 --> 14:17.765
I don't have a picture of that, because they wouldn't let me take pictures in there.

14:17.785 --> 14:33.990
But there were these pillars along the walkways on the sides where the elegant murals are that are being fought over now, because the Asian Art Museum that's moving in there wants to take them down.

14:34.662 --> 14:41.110
They're not suitable, although they're only sort of vague trees.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.532
Are they WPA things?

14:43.072 --> 14:43.793
Sort of, no.

14:43.913 --> 14:45.175
They're wonderful.

14:45.195 --> 14:46.076
I love all those.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.058
These are not that style.

14:48.138 --> 14:51.623
These are very— They're pre-art deco?

14:52.984 --> 14:56.849
Yeah, they're very mild-mannered.

14:56.889 --> 15:01.935
And then there's a lot of writings on the walls that have to be taken down.

15:02.236 --> 15:20.993
And I got an audio tape of the auctioneer, and they'd start with, over and over, they'd start with 50, 40, 30, 10, and then they'd hit 10, and maybe they could get someone to stick up a card to, for $10, get one of these whole lots of furniture.

15:22.614 --> 15:27.599
But if there were a card catalog in it, they'd get a couple of beads.

15:28.340 --> 15:32.023
But there weren't enough people to bid against each other.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.241
Oh, so it goes.

15:35.862 --> 15:36.563
Yeah.

15:36.743 --> 15:37.584
It's sad.

15:37.664 --> 15:41.769
It's sort of like a bloodless revolution, you know?

15:41.789 --> 15:42.169
You know what?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.993
I think I've got lots of stuff.

15:45.013 --> 15:47.375
Do you think there's anything else I need?

15:48.437 --> 15:55.505
Not that I can think of now, but I wanted to... I'm seeing Walter Biller tomorrow morning.

15:55.665 --> 16:00.751
Oh, he's really... That's... And I'm seeing Killy, and I'm seeing Chafee at the wrong time.

16:00.771 --> 16:02.533
Okay, you're going to... Fine, I lost it.

16:02.885 --> 16:06.389
Anyway, that's like unloading stuff from the Old Main Library.

16:06.429 --> 16:09.452
And you know what it says, over the Old Main Library?

16:09.492 --> 16:11.294
You need that quote.

16:11.434 --> 16:12.396
I don't know if I have it.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.418
Tilly knows it by heart, however.

16:14.518 --> 16:15.699
Walk over it.

16:15.719 --> 16:16.100
Yeah.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.742
What is it, roughly?

16:17.762 --> 16:23.388
May this thing built on imperishable books last forever or something.

16:23.408 --> 16:25.490
Well, that could be the beginning of the chapter.

16:25.510 --> 16:26.091
Yes, indeed.

16:26.651 --> 16:28.093
Quote, over the Old Main.

16:28.574 --> 16:28.894
Yeah.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.696
I think we'll go right now.

16:30.716 --> 16:30.816
Yeah.

16:31.167 --> 16:40.836
And then I wanted to be sure to show you, or tell you, I don't know if you'll have time for him, it's another man that is into books.

16:41.757 --> 16:43.359
His name is David Farrelly.

16:44.020 --> 16:44.500
David.

16:45.541 --> 16:50.246
F-A-R-R-E-L-Y.

16:52.328 --> 16:59.875
Why has it vanished?

17:03.500 --> 17:11.169
You've taken pictures, you've done audio tapes, you've gone over for books, you've gone to meetings, you've mobilized people.

17:11.189 --> 17:12.531
Would you say you're obsessed by this?

17:12.771 --> 17:14.713
Yes, I would, and I have.

17:15.354 --> 17:22.343
And I need to recover because I have become occasionally anxiety-ridden.

17:22.403 --> 17:29.051
I mean, I'm really nervous and intense, and I've let other parts of my life get out of order.

17:29.852 --> 17:32.595
So it's like I'm sort of...

17:33.757 --> 17:36.340
And this still needs some kind of order.

17:36.380 --> 17:45.950
I mean, I need to be able to put the books up on shelves in order or get them off my hands, you know, because it's... Yes, I'm obsessed.

17:45.970 --> 17:47.771
You'd like to be done with this?

17:48.052 --> 18:00.945
I think maybe, although I never thought that would happen, but I think... I don't know, maybe I got exasperated with...

18:02.275 --> 18:13.073
The day that I was interviewing people who couldn't get into the library, my car was illegally towed away from right up on Grove Street there.

18:13.113 --> 18:28.738
There's a whole row of cars, all parked, and I came, you know, like they had marked off, tow-away zone, don't park, all around Civic Center, all around this block of, oh, I'm pointing wrong, all around the library itself, but across the street from the library,

18:29.140 --> 18:31.863
There were no signs, and there were a whole lot of cars parked.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.126
A car pulled out just as I pulled out.

18:34.466 --> 18:35.007
I'm lucky.

18:35.567 --> 18:36.508
I got a parking place.

18:37.269 --> 18:37.810
Parked there.

18:39.212 --> 18:43.356
And lo and behold, later on, all those cars had been towed away.

18:43.416 --> 18:46.039
This isn't every night, I hope, when I'm parked there.

18:46.059 --> 18:46.340
No, no.

18:46.780 --> 18:50.004
No, it was for that mayor's conference.

18:50.024 --> 18:50.404
Oh, I see.

18:50.424 --> 18:50.524
Okay.

18:50.544 --> 18:51.305
Yeah, no, no.

18:52.206 --> 18:56.892
Although I'm leery, across the street there is a sign towed away.

18:57.112 --> 18:58.033
I cannot believe.

18:58.553 --> 19:01.637
This is another friend.

19:03.199 --> 19:09.929
This is a brilliant fellow.

19:10.430 --> 19:11.531
Yeah.

19:11.551 --> 19:19.422
He is collecting books to give to—they're all over this car.

19:19.662 --> 19:21.004
It is phenomenal.

19:22.146 --> 19:25.310
He's getting them from community thrift shops.

19:25.530 --> 19:25.911
These are just

19:26.144 --> 19:29.589
books are piling out of this culture, just pouring out of them.

19:32.735 --> 19:33.776
That's his number.

19:33.856 --> 19:38.824
And I talked to him last night, and he'd be quite happy to talk to you if you want to talk to him.

19:38.964 --> 19:52.506
His concern is to get these books somewhere, perhaps to prisons, because he'll tell you about how prisons are the third world in the third world here, and that California is the

19:53.684 --> 19:58.490
found land for that, since we had such a high proportion of people stuck away in prisons.

19:59.872 --> 20:03.817
But these are books, these are also library books?

20:04.018 --> 20:08.003
No, no, no library books.

20:08.023 --> 20:09.925
He just, these are just books.

20:09.945 --> 20:21.801
I happened, somebody told me about him because they thought I was totally obsessive about all books, although I have taken books too from the library

20:25.527 --> 20:35.035
You know, the public gives the library books that I suppose they think are going to go into the collection, or going to help the library somehow.

20:35.656 --> 20:36.317
All right, books are gone.

20:36.337 --> 20:39.079
Those go to twenty-five cent sales, yeah.

20:39.099 --> 20:41.701
But every library does that to us.

20:41.721 --> 20:41.922
Right.

20:42.462 --> 20:46.266
And if they don't sell them, what they do is they trash them.

20:46.926 --> 20:50.049
They admit that they send them to the dump.

20:50.069 --> 20:54.673
And I know people who have been digging around in

20:54.907 --> 20:55.988
What do you call those bins?

20:56.549 --> 20:56.949
Dumpsters.

20:57.050 --> 20:57.810
Dumpsters, you know.

20:58.471 --> 21:02.236
In the dumpster with the books, finding great old books and getting them out.

21:03.217 --> 21:20.577
So at any rate, I have gone to—what the Friends of the Library do is to offer to community groups who are interested at the end of the sale to come and take whatever books they want, because they know that if they don't go that day, then they get dumped.

21:22.312 --> 21:24.995
If I have time to give David a call, I will.

21:25.015 --> 21:28.380
You'll find him a very interesting person, very high energy.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.982
Does he bring all these books to his home?

21:30.923 --> 21:33.146
Yeah, that's next door to his house.

21:34.808 --> 21:46.362
But his room, I went up, I met him once, I went into his room, and you could just barely get in through a little pathway, and then there was a little corner area with two chairs where you could sit and a window.

21:47.033 --> 21:51.420
And that was the space he had left to live in, and it was all just stacked to the ceiling with books.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.124
What explained his passion for them, do you think?

21:54.144 --> 21:55.486
He's a passionate person.

21:55.566 --> 22:00.594
He wrote a book called The Bamboo Book, and it's all about bamboo.

22:00.614 --> 22:02.137
It was kind of a 60s book.

22:02.277 --> 22:02.898
It was published?

22:03.078 --> 22:12.012
Yeah, big paperback, big oversized thing, and it had everything you ever wanted to know and ever didn't care if you didn't know about bamboos.

22:13.578 --> 22:25.175
He thought it might save, you know, like you can make paper out of it and you can, the trouble is, what he doesn't admit in there, he had me convinced and I was telling people about bamboo and they'd just look at me and say, it takes over.

22:26.737 --> 22:27.739
You can't control it.

22:27.759 --> 22:32.005
The root system, it's hard to control.

22:33.086 --> 22:39.736
Oh, and one other thing, you have to have another book.

22:41.058 --> 22:41.799
This is your book.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.281
Yeah, Poems.

22:43.582 --> 22:44.603
Oh, okay.

22:46.184 --> 22:47.045
You don't have to.

22:47.085 --> 22:50.609
You must not accept it if you... Oh, I thank you.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.892
And this is supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.416
Congratulations.

22:59.197 --> 22:59.717
Well, thank you.

22:59.737 --> 23:01.579
It'll give me a sense of you, I guess.

23:01.599 --> 23:07.605
Well, it'll give you a sense of where I'm coming from in relation to technology.

23:08.065 --> 23:08.966
You're giving this to me?

23:08.986 --> 23:09.447
Yeah.

23:09.467 --> 23:10.888
Would you describe it for me?

23:11.864 --> 23:14.086
I never know how to do that.

23:14.306 --> 23:15.247
You're a book person.

23:15.267 --> 23:15.727
You know.

23:17.209 --> 23:18.570
Yeah, you say whatever you want.

23:18.590 --> 23:19.731
It's my card, I believe.

23:19.751 --> 23:20.451
It's my card.

23:24.295 --> 23:24.735
Thank you.

23:24.755 --> 23:30.540
You could call me Nick or Nicholas or whatever, but it was such a great kind.

23:35.384 --> 23:40.889
I believe people who write poetry reveal everything in their poetry.

23:40.909 --> 23:41.449
Don't you think?

23:42.357 --> 23:45.642
Let me think a second.

23:49.788 --> 23:58.961
And dated, too.

23:58.981 --> 24:07.994
And how did the grant come into being?

24:08.014 --> 24:10.457
Uh, through, uh,

24:11.112 --> 24:17.000
A poetry workshop that was run by a poet by the name of Stephanie Mines.

24:20.364 --> 24:25.691
Congratulations.

24:25.711 --> 24:27.133
How long have you been writing poetry?

24:28.074 --> 24:31.478
Oh, years, the date.

24:31.498 --> 24:34.923
Today's September 8th, 1997.

24:34.943 --> 24:38.908
And then you can write San Francisco, too.

24:40.930 --> 24:45.998
It's all part of the echo, you know, makes it a place and time.

24:48.963 --> 24:51.928
Yeah, that makes it so nice.

24:52.108 --> 24:52.549
Thank you.

24:52.950 --> 24:53.951
You're very welcome.

24:54.272 --> 24:55.013
That's great.

24:55.955 --> 25:02.365
Well, what I might say about that is that they are

25:02.918 --> 25:11.769
a number of poems that were written over a period of time and not necessarily in connection with each other, but I arranged them in the form of a monomyth.

25:12.150 --> 25:12.710
Is that yours?

25:12.730 --> 25:13.952
That's yours.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.494
You have basically that.

25:15.534 --> 25:15.634
Okay.

25:15.654 --> 25:19.779
If I have that information, there's no need to replicate it.

25:19.839 --> 25:19.959
Right.

25:19.979 --> 25:22.763
This is in order of publication.

25:22.803 --> 25:26.147
But I can derive that.

25:26.167 --> 25:29.491
One of the lists is, I think, in order of publication.

25:29.511 --> 25:32.335
So it's in the form of a monomyth, Joseph Campbell's.

25:32.956 --> 25:48.593
of a boiled down analysis of what all the ancient myths are composed of, which is that you have a setting, a locality, a community.

25:50.776 --> 25:52.177
It's going along.

25:52.998 --> 25:55.281
It's threatened by something from outside.

25:55.581 --> 26:00.246
Something comes upon it, and it has to deal with it.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.519
doesn't necessarily come into their midst, but they are threatened.

26:03.739 --> 26:29.018
The hero takes on the responsibility for dealing with this threat and goes forth to save the community from the threat and then returns in some form or other, might be transformed into another life form, you know, might not have made it through the...

26:29.521 --> 26:34.169
grows himself in encountering the dragon.

26:34.970 --> 26:54.364
So would you say, is it just coincidental that the Great Panthers abuts the library that explains part of your interest in this, or that you could see things going on here from where you are?

26:55.103 --> 26:58.507
I think just totally coincidental that we happened to be here.

26:58.847 --> 27:01.330
It is literally right out the door here.

27:01.991 --> 27:02.251
Right.

27:02.392 --> 27:14.526
No, although it was distressing from the get-go to see the construction process beginning, again, feeling that the system is coming in upon us.

27:14.586 --> 27:23.997
That used to be open space, a parking lot, green lawn, and a little kind of...

27:24.905 --> 27:31.952
Yeah, so as we would come and go from the office, it wasn't just me, we would see there were other people that were even more hostile to the idea.

27:31.972 --> 27:33.974
I didn't have a lot of reaction.

27:34.014 --> 27:37.017
I had more important things on my mind.

27:38.478 --> 27:47.827
But I didn't like that the pleasant kind of open space thing was going to be intruded upon.

27:48.288 --> 27:50.490
I didn't know anything about what was coming our way.

27:51.145 --> 27:57.395
And then when they started really working and excavating, that was distinctly unpleasant, and they didn't like that.

27:57.415 --> 28:17.305
And then there was a fight over this, and they spent a million dollars to move a huge statue, which is now between, you'll see it, it's a, I can't remember what it's called, it's a huge, on a big pedestal statue of a

28:19.023 --> 28:21.506
figures and a kneeling Indian.

28:22.427 --> 28:22.928
He told me about that.

28:22.948 --> 28:41.632
So the Indian community, the Native American community, did not feature preserving this thing at all, so there got to be a great fight, and so they spent all this money to move that huge heavy thing over to where it is now in order to accommodate that weird design on the back of the building.

28:44.155 --> 28:44.515
Amazing.

28:44.535 --> 28:45.717
I'm going to talk to the architect.

28:45.817 --> 28:47.359
Let me talk to that woman and see what

28:47.508 --> 28:53.855
Well, there were a lot of fights between bureaucracies.

28:53.935 --> 29:04.648
There was the art commission, there was the Department of Public Works, and there's the city planning department.

29:05.408 --> 29:17.262
Anyway, part of the difficulty was that the work orders kept changing.

29:19.368 --> 29:21.690
But Coulter was in the midst of that.

29:22.050 --> 29:28.756
I mean, I always figured that he had a lot to do with the— I have an 800 number, too, by the way, which I'll just give you.

29:30.798 --> 29:32.839
With the changes that took place.

29:32.899 --> 29:36.683
And one of the changes—don't let him kid you—it wasn't just money being taken away.

29:36.763 --> 29:48.953
One of the changes was that the original design called for another floor than there is, and that floor got lost because when they dug down,

29:49.321 --> 29:57.993
They found water, and they couldn't put anything in that close to the water, so they had to move up everything that was happening.

29:58.013 --> 30:01.317
So that was one of the reasons that was given for losing a floor.

30:03.180 --> 30:04.321
Do you mind telling me how old you are?

30:04.361 --> 30:06.044
You don't have to, but you're— Sixty-five.

30:06.444 --> 30:10.069
Great Panthers don't lie about their age.

30:10.089 --> 30:13.033
And so how long have you been a Great Panther?

30:14.077 --> 30:17.922
Well, I guess it's getting on about 20 years or longer.

30:17.942 --> 30:21.186
So there's no age, you just join it for issues?

30:21.206 --> 30:30.779
Yeah, yeah, yeah, kids can join, because it's an intergenerational, we're perceived as only older people, and in fact, in this group, there aren't any younger ones.

30:30.879 --> 30:33.403
We keep inviting them, and they don't want any part of us.

30:33.423 --> 30:34.644
That's important, you know.

30:35.245 --> 30:43.476
I mean, I said to myself, this woman can't be, I'm looking at you, I mean, you're not 70, that's for sure, you know, and I went home, I said,

30:44.300 --> 30:52.078
I had this impression, you know, when you hear of Grey Panther, that this is this retired lady, you know, that's just not the case.

30:52.119 --> 30:52.840
Don't I wish.

30:53.121 --> 30:55.226
That's just not the case.

30:55.246 --> 31:02.443
No, some of them, I mean, a lot of our members, we're an aging organization, and unless we get in new blood, we're going to be, you know, like,

31:03.132 --> 31:08.218
People get sick, and they get put in nursing homes, and they fall down and break their knees.

31:11.422 --> 31:14.966
So we're having a convention here in a month.

31:14.986 --> 31:16.668
A national convention?

31:17.009 --> 31:17.349
Yeah.

31:17.529 --> 31:22.495
And our founder, Maggie Kuhn, who's a—she's why I joined.

31:22.555 --> 31:25.959
I thought, okay, I don't know what else— Maggie Kuhn, K-U-H-N.

31:27.561 --> 31:30.625
She was a witty, smart, brash.

31:32.275 --> 31:34.578
fiesty, marvelous human being.

31:34.598 --> 31:36.481
I love the name, The Great Phantist, too.

31:36.501 --> 31:36.942
It's wonderful.

31:37.002 --> 31:38.063
Yeah, yeah.

31:39.525 --> 31:52.784
But she just died a year or two ago, so we had an organizational identity crisis, and apparently a lot of power-shifting stuff going on in Washington where the main offices are.

31:52.985 --> 32:01.557
It's a national organization, and so we're just recovering from that, trying to get restructured

32:02.296 --> 32:11.426
And so we're going to have a convention here at the end of this month and hopefully settle some differences that have been coming up.

32:11.446 --> 32:18.714
Like the national office will make some kind of decision and not let us know, and then we'll just be told that we're a little too independent for that.

32:20.275 --> 32:21.897
That does not go down well.

32:23.619 --> 32:29.485
Well listen, I'm going to, I think I've taken up two hours a week.

32:29.887 --> 32:31.509
got made over the months.

32:32.270 --> 32:45.708
I took them out of the newsletter, and I put it together to give to the people at the library conference, or what do you call it, the Library Association Convention that was here.

32:46.309 --> 32:53.178
And then we handed these out on a most— Here comes the information superhighway you're talking about, yeah.

32:53.258 --> 32:56.923
Yeah, and we—a bunch of us, the Grey Panthers,

32:57.477 --> 33:03.064
went to the Mosconi Center where the convention was being held and stood in the hallway.

33:03.144 --> 33:16.740
And on this side was, let's see if I can make sure I can't mistake this, Kathy Page was doing, the librarian, the former librarian, was doing a presentation.

33:17.381 --> 33:21.325
And on the other side, I think it was Ken Dallin.

33:21.646 --> 33:26.792
Yeah, he was talking about how to, I don't know, one of them was talking about how to raise money for

33:27.633 --> 33:31.679
Anyway, we were standing in between handing this thing out.

33:31.699 --> 33:32.220
That's funny.

33:32.741 --> 33:34.644
It was funny.

33:34.684 --> 33:37.248
Have you read any of these books that you've taken?

33:37.268 --> 33:38.449
Oh, that's why, yes.

33:42.475 --> 33:47.283
You know when somebody else kind of wanders around the house and wonders what they're going to do and they turn on the TV?

33:47.743 --> 33:49.606
Well, I don't turn on the TV, I never have.

33:50.147 --> 33:54.754
I've been wandering around the house, getting to those points of what am I going to do, and I

33:55.173 --> 33:57.577
reach into one of the boxes and pick out a book.

33:58.578 --> 34:14.543
And I have read, that's part of the reason I'm addled, I have read probably, not all of, but seriously into maybe fifty books over the past, say, six months or so, or maybe a year.

34:14.824 --> 34:18.329
But the first part of the time I was in this frenzy.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.932
I didn't have time to read.

34:19.952 --> 34:22.075
It was a project at that point.

34:22.207 --> 34:25.672
But since then I'm left with all these sort of leftover books, right?

34:26.553 --> 34:37.549
And I'm curious about them, and in fact the ones on the stairs are the ones that I was down in the basement writing out the index cards on, and I keep another box beside me.

34:37.569 --> 34:40.674
That's a book I need to kind of check out when I get a chance.

34:41.215 --> 34:49.547
So they're lined up on my stairs going up into my flat, but there are other books already

34:50.438 --> 34:53.543
in my flat that I had special interest in.

34:53.603 --> 34:59.712
So there's just this kind of bottomless pit of books yet for me to check out.

34:59.752 --> 35:03.197
And what happens is I don't read all of them, but I— You dip into them.

35:03.277 --> 35:03.938
Right, right.

35:04.078 --> 35:08.404
And then, not having a system, I kind of pile them up next to the bed.

35:09.145 --> 35:11.008
So I get surrounded.

35:11.028 --> 35:14.173
And any of them particularly grabbing you as you go along?

35:14.193 --> 35:17.037
Can you think of any of that?

35:18.822 --> 35:30.678
One that really impressed me was a book that surprised me by Mark Twain called... They deaccessioned a Mark Twain book?

35:30.698 --> 35:30.979
Yeah.

35:31.139 --> 35:31.740
That you got?

35:31.760 --> 35:33.222
They had other copies.

35:33.242 --> 35:33.682
Oh, I see.

35:33.762 --> 35:34.784
Okay.

35:36.186 --> 35:38.829
About Joan of Arc.

35:38.849 --> 35:39.550
I know that book.

35:39.931 --> 35:41.913
I haven't read it, but I know it.

35:41.933 --> 35:42.674
Well, I read it.

35:42.795 --> 35:48.222
I don't think I want... You know, there's so many... It's like this... My head is like...

35:48.607 --> 35:52.152
all chopped up, you know, like there are other books too.

35:52.212 --> 36:06.029
But that one, I was so impressed by his almost belief in the myth of Joan of Arc.

36:06.049 --> 36:07.932
Well, he believed in a lot of weird things.

36:08.252 --> 36:09.173
Yeah, yeah.

36:09.534 --> 36:13.980
He liked to come on like a kind of a, what would be the word?

36:14.020 --> 36:14.981
I'm too tired now.

36:15.081 --> 36:16.723
I'm exhausted myself.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.635
Let's go.

36:19.226 --> 36:19.592
We've done it.
