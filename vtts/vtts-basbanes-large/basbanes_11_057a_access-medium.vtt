WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:06.241
We're going to have to take notes on what... So how do you pronounce your name?

00:07.362 --> 00:08.945
It's very difficult for an American.

00:09.325 --> 00:10.246
Let's say U-A.

00:11.108 --> 00:11.969
U-A, okay.

00:12.529 --> 00:13.290
H-U-R-E-T.

00:13.471 --> 00:16.134
And your friends called you Steve Land this day.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.817
Exactly, because my mother was American.

00:17.837 --> 00:18.738
Uh-huh.

00:18.758 --> 00:21.742
And you are the president of what we call SLAM.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.486
Yes, which is like your ABA.

00:24.506 --> 00:26.889
Which is like our ABA.

00:28.010 --> 00:29.072
In the States.

00:30.554 --> 00:31.455
And...

00:31.908 --> 00:37.058
with about 220 booksellers in France.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.842
Would you say most of them are here in Paris?

00:39.022 --> 00:44.112
No, about half in Paris and half in the province.

00:45.094 --> 00:47.318
When we were chatting out in the other room,

00:47.737 --> 00:55.126
I asked if the power of the book is still as strong as ever, and you said it depends on the age of the... What did you mean by that?

00:55.146 --> 01:14.470
What I mean is there's a long tradition of fine books in France, and as they're getting very, very expensive, young people who have the problems you know, I mean, even if it's quite different in the States,

01:15.142 --> 01:22.031
In France, they have a problem to find a job, to keep their job, to find an apartment.

01:25.175 --> 01:38.753
So we are not sure that young people will be as interested as their parents were with the fine books.

01:39.374 --> 01:45.503
And furthermore, they are very much interested by music, by internet, and so on.

01:47.385 --> 01:49.989
That's what I call a question of age.

01:50.329 --> 01:52.072
Do you have any younger customers?

01:52.232 --> 01:53.894
Any at all?

01:53.914 --> 01:58.561
Yes, but not for very expensive books.

01:58.581 --> 02:04.029
And don't forget, we have about three million unemployed.

02:04.069 --> 02:08.655
So that's a real problem.

02:08.804 --> 02:17.611
Even if people have the money to buy books, they don't, they think it's wise to wait a bit.

02:18.832 --> 02:22.996
Personal problems and problems with the children are more important.

02:24.778 --> 02:30.362
But now, do you find, however, when you find a wonderful book, that there is still a buyer for the wonderful book?

02:30.382 --> 02:32.064
Of course, of course, of course.

02:33.125 --> 02:38.389
I'm not saying, I'm not saying, it's...

02:40.529 --> 02:47.258
I'm just saying that the market, I think, is getting pretty difficult.

02:48.800 --> 02:54.608
Furthermore, there are more and more books that are sold at auction.

02:55.790 --> 03:09.388
As you know, probably, Salve and Christie are going to settle in Paris because it's going to...

03:10.246 --> 03:39.679
the status of the people who sell books now is going to change and at the beginning of 98 because here books are not sold by private firms as they are in other countries but it's a special status which is going to change at the beginning of 98 do you find you mentioned the

03:39.946 --> 03:46.855
the wonderful books, do you find that the values are continuing to appreciate, or are they holding steady?

03:46.895 --> 03:52.202
I think they're holding pretty steady.

03:52.242 --> 04:06.640
They've gone down for what you call artist book or illustrative books, because that follows the market of the modern paintings.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.784
So that has gone down a bit.

04:10.405 --> 04:15.169
But the other books, no, because they're getting scarcer and scarcer every day.

04:15.189 --> 04:21.855
So, I mean, there's no question that they still sell for a good price.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.938
How would you describe your specialty?

04:26.479 --> 04:26.860
Here?

04:26.960 --> 04:27.180
Yes.

04:28.841 --> 04:35.327
Well, we have a very important search service.

04:35.347 --> 04:39.771
That's not our main activity, but we are known for that.

04:40.139 --> 04:42.983
120,000 books in stock.

04:43.924 --> 04:49.853
And every week we issue a list of wants.

04:50.974 --> 05:09.741
And I have another bookshop, which is called the Librairie Niquez, which I just bought, and who was created in 1943, which is very well known for modern bibliophily, books that are done today.

05:10.092 --> 05:14.097
And this was a story that was created during the war in 1948?

05:14.117 --> 05:14.697
Exactly.

05:14.717 --> 05:16.119
That's interesting, isn't it?

05:16.219 --> 05:23.288
Well, you know, it was so difficult to find books at that time, but the business was very good.

05:23.548 --> 05:24.409
The business was good?

05:24.809 --> 05:31.838
Of course, because as soon as they had a book, it was sold immediately.

05:32.338 --> 05:34.361
Who were the customers during the war?

05:34.381 --> 05:35.622
The people who were in Paris.

05:35.662 --> 05:37.905
I mean, there were quite a few.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.508
Who is the proprietor?

05:41.049 --> 05:41.510
Niquez.

05:41.790 --> 05:42.291
Niquez.

05:42.932 --> 05:45.055
Is he deceased now?

05:45.115 --> 05:46.076
No, no, no, no.

05:46.697 --> 05:48.039
He's very ill now.

05:48.159 --> 05:53.407
He's 87, I think, and very ill in the south of France.

05:53.848 --> 05:58.555
He finally decided to sell the... Yes, he must be a very interesting man.

05:58.995 --> 06:00.097
Very interesting.

06:00.117 --> 06:03.041
Is he somebody that I should talk to, do you think, at some point?

06:03.141 --> 06:05.665
I don't think you can, because he...

06:05.932 --> 06:10.459
I don't know how you call that, but he's on, you say a dialyse?

06:11.761 --> 06:13.924
When you have problem with your kidneys?

06:14.585 --> 06:16.508
The dialysis?

06:16.528 --> 06:17.530
Yes, exactly.

06:17.570 --> 06:20.234
So he has that three times a week.

06:20.254 --> 06:20.675
Oh my goodness.

06:20.715 --> 06:23.419
Twenty-four, twenty-two hours every time.

06:23.439 --> 06:27.525
Nobody, nobody.

06:27.565 --> 06:29.709
Has he written a memoir of this?

06:29.729 --> 06:30.690
Not at all.

06:31.582 --> 06:40.852
I'm going to see Pierre Bérez this afternoon, who worked during, who was in business during the war.

06:42.574 --> 06:43.295
That's very interesting.

06:43.335 --> 06:47.760
So were books inexpensive during the war, do you think, or were they expensive?

06:48.081 --> 06:51.204
I don't think they were very expensive, but they sold very well.

06:51.284 --> 06:54.148
I'm not speaking so much of the old books.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.351
I'm speaking of the books that were published.

06:57.892 --> 06:58.272
I see.

06:58.412 --> 07:00.795
As soon as they had some paper,

07:01.147 --> 07:09.137
They issued a book, I mean the big publishers, and it was very easily sold, so I was told.

07:10.579 --> 07:12.521
Do you find changing fashions in books?

07:13.382 --> 07:13.963
Of course.

07:14.003 --> 07:18.789
What would you say is on the ascendancy now of what kinds of books are?

07:19.970 --> 07:28.200
I would say books on science, books on travels, but certain regions of the world,

07:29.277 --> 07:37.068
It's very, we follow the, I don't know how you say it in English, but l'actualité, which is what happens.

07:37.109 --> 07:56.517
I mean, for instance, now it's very difficult to sell a book on Russia and the eastern world, because since the Berlin Wall fell, and other countries are very much looked after,

07:57.104 --> 08:04.791
Africa is less looked after, Asia is very much looked after, Korea, Japan.

08:05.692 --> 08:10.556
So it follows the general economy, as always, as always.

08:10.576 --> 08:14.559
Do you have any thoughts as we approach the 21st century?

08:14.620 --> 08:23.487
I mean, you were saying that the younger people of today don't seem to be expressing the same degree of enthusiasm for books as their parents, perhaps.

08:24.168 --> 08:26.270
Do you have any thoughts as we approach?

08:26.290 --> 08:26.470
No.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.100
No.

08:28.962 --> 08:44.575
What I think is that there is a whole, many, many categories of books which were not looked after before, that are more and more looked for now.

08:45.156 --> 08:46.977
For example, photography.

08:48.438 --> 08:56.305
Because as people work less and have more, how should I say, have more

08:56.690 --> 09:01.116
more time to spare for their leisure.

09:01.176 --> 09:02.918
They have many, many interests.

09:04.180 --> 09:13.032
And as always, when you are interested by something, you always can finally come to a book because there's a lot of knowledge in books.

09:13.793 --> 09:26.190
So many books, for example, books about food and gastronomy, which did interest many people 20 years ago,

09:26.525 --> 09:29.909
now interest lots of people.

09:30.469 --> 09:45.685
Same thing for books about anything that's related to life, natural history, science, photography, horses, and so on.

09:46.726 --> 09:50.851
So that's not what we used to call bibliophily.

09:51.471 --> 09:56.076
Bibliophily was essentially for literature,

09:56.663 --> 10:00.789
big text, important text in the first editions.

10:01.831 --> 10:07.760
And that I think is still very important.

10:07.800 --> 10:12.367
I mean, Joyce is always very looked for after.

10:13.269 --> 10:21.962
But I mean, there's many categories of books which I think are going to interest more and more

10:22.195 --> 10:24.158
Very many people.

10:24.178 --> 10:32.749
For example, books about mystery, how do you say, science fiction?

10:32.769 --> 10:33.089
What?

10:33.310 --> 10:34.091
Science fiction?

10:34.111 --> 10:35.152
Yes, science fiction.

10:35.192 --> 10:38.597
Nobody was interested by that 20 years ago.

10:38.617 --> 10:41.981
And now you have dealers who only deal with that.

10:42.001 --> 10:43.683
Same thing with mystery books.

10:43.984 --> 10:47.588
I mean... Do you think because they're available?

10:48.590 --> 10:51.814
I think because young people...

10:52.148 --> 11:05.802
who are not interested by what we call the literature, the important literature, are interested by that kind of books, which don't cost much.

11:05.942 --> 11:09.706
I mean, it's easy for them to buy them.

11:09.887 --> 11:12.629
Easy to buy, easy to find.

11:12.669 --> 11:17.334
And I think there's quite a market there.

11:17.795 --> 11:18.055
Wow.

11:18.592 --> 11:30.422
See, we in the United States have this debate going on about the collapse of the Western canon, the canon of literature, the great books that you're talking about here in France.

11:30.442 --> 11:34.206
You say they're not so interested in Voltaire or Guiderot.

11:34.506 --> 11:35.827
No, I didn't say that.

11:35.847 --> 11:40.852
I think that, I mean, if you want a Voltaire, everybody wants the Kelly edition.

11:42.953 --> 11:48.278
What I think, I mean, I'm not sure, what I think is that the younger people

11:48.865 --> 11:53.873
I'm not that much interested by that kind of literature.

11:53.893 --> 11:54.674
The great works.

11:54.895 --> 11:55.836
The great works.

11:56.397 --> 12:01.705
Because it's available in so many editions.

12:01.846 --> 12:13.204
I mean, you find the big paperbacks, you find the playaids, you find many, many, many collections which don't cost much.

12:13.344 --> 12:13.945
So...

12:17.047 --> 12:28.016
And as the television is very, very important, I think they're more interested by things, as I said, their daily life.

12:31.299 --> 12:38.345
Fine arts, architecture, you see, all those things that they deal with in their life.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.368
More, I think, than literature.

12:41.608 --> 12:43.690
But I might be wrong, I don't know.

12:43.870 --> 12:46.092
So do you think that these represent

12:46.612 --> 12:58.083
the best opportunities and directions for... No, not at all, because, as you know, every bookseller has his own field of interest.

12:58.424 --> 13:01.907
I mean, Bob Fleck is interested by bibliography.

13:03.268 --> 13:11.637
He doesn't care whether it would be more worthwhile to deal with an actual history book.

13:11.877 --> 13:13.058
He's interested in that.

13:13.578 --> 13:18.165
Here, for example, we are interested in the search service.

13:19.246 --> 13:31.745
So it's a very personal pleasure, I mean, so... Let's talk a bit about that, because I'm actually writing two books for Henry Holt, which is my publisher.

13:32.026 --> 13:39.737
One is this general philosophic kind of anecdotal narrative history, history of...

13:40.207 --> 13:46.075
But another is actually a useful guide to book collecting for the 21st century.

13:46.095 --> 13:49.560
Now, you mentioned you have 120,000 books in stock.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.642
Obviously, they're not here.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.404
They're all here.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.065
In this building?

13:53.606 --> 13:54.507
No, in front.

13:54.828 --> 13:56.010
Oh, over there.

13:56.050 --> 13:56.510
Okay.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.633
So everything is in computer.

13:58.854 --> 14:00.236
Well, that's my next question.

14:00.316 --> 14:01.658
Everything is in computer.

14:01.678 --> 14:08.307
If you ask me any subject, I think we have about 680 subjects.

14:08.708 --> 14:17.340
Three minutes after you have a list, all the books are here, and then it takes three minutes to have them brought here.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.966
So the computer then is essential for the business that you do.

14:22.166 --> 14:26.292
And it has changed quite a lot the business.

14:26.753 --> 14:28.235
Could you talk a little bit about that?

14:28.655 --> 14:29.476
Oh, very easily.

14:29.516 --> 14:38.108
I mean, some people think that the antiquarian book business

14:38.510 --> 14:40.072
can be a part of life.

14:41.634 --> 14:42.415
It can't be.

14:42.996 --> 14:56.272
For example, the circulation, the driving in Paris is very, very difficult.

14:56.793 --> 14:58.114
Very difficult.

14:58.134 --> 15:00.517
You can't leave your car anywhere.

15:01.018 --> 15:04.382
So less and less people take their car.

15:05.172 --> 15:11.239
So less and less people go to bookshops, and they all wait for the catalogues.

15:11.259 --> 15:15.303
So more and more booksellers publish catalogues.

15:17.205 --> 15:23.913
So the catalogues are less and less, how do you say, rentables.

15:24.934 --> 15:29.859
You get less and less money because everybody now sends a catalog.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.323
And we, with the computer,

15:34.990 --> 15:37.553
Hello?

15:37.573 --> 15:39.355
What did I say?

15:39.375 --> 15:40.095
The computer.

15:40.156 --> 15:43.319
For example, the computer has changed quite a lot.

15:43.619 --> 15:48.945
It has changed quite a lot the way of even seeing things.

15:48.985 --> 15:54.191
We don't know whether we're still going to publish catalogs in two or three or four years.

15:54.211 --> 16:03.040
Because now, as people have very specific interests, if they say they're interested in Tibet, we just pressure

16:03.256 --> 16:09.584
press a button, and we can send that person a list of all the books we have on Tibet.

16:10.586 --> 16:29.171
So why should we sign a catalogue as we do now of 2,000 titles, I'll give them to you afterwards, which are sent to 3,000 people, most of them being only interested in one part of the catalogue.

16:29.191 --> 16:30.833
So why sign a whole catalogue

16:31.403 --> 16:34.568
to people who are only interested in one or two or three subjects.

16:34.588 --> 16:44.224
It's easier to send them lists once a year of all that we have or that has come in the stock since the last list.

16:44.244 --> 16:47.910
And what you would hope that as more people get onto the Internet,

16:48.548 --> 16:59.723
that you won't even have to publish the list so that they can... We are also on the internet, and we work pretty much with them, with the whole world, as anybody.

16:59.943 --> 17:10.918
Do you find that where most of your business is, by search and by telephone call, I guess, that most of them do not come into the store?

17:10.938 --> 17:11.820
Oh, no, no, no.

17:11.860 --> 17:17.307
They send us either a fax or a... fax or a...

17:17.877 --> 17:25.528
or a phone call to ask if others are looking for such and such a book, and then we try and find it.

17:26.750 --> 17:34.521
There are many, many people who are looking for very different reasons for a book.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.245
It's very interesting.

17:37.265 --> 17:45.336
So at what point would you say that your business started to develop more towards the search service when the computer became more...

17:46.008 --> 17:51.998
No, because I started that 20 years ago and we had no computer.

17:52.238 --> 18:01.393
The computer helps us to do things that we could even dream of doing before.

18:02.755 --> 18:06.221
Every book, for example, was on a little card.

18:06.781 --> 18:11.509
So when somebody asked us in the province, what do you have on...

18:12.299 --> 18:15.930
Tibet, we couldn't say because you have to come to Paris.

18:16.713 --> 18:19.923
Now we just press a button and you receive it in 24 hours.

18:20.003 --> 18:26.022
If somebody like myself is looking for a very obscure book, you put it in the computer, attach it to my name,

18:26.373 --> 18:29.438
When this book comes in, it runs through the computer.

18:29.498 --> 18:31.562
You say, oh, Mr. Bazbaines wants this book.

18:31.582 --> 18:32.023
Exactly.

18:32.043 --> 18:33.986
And you notify me there that you have it.

18:34.207 --> 18:37.953
So the way of working has changed enormously.

18:38.053 --> 18:40.237
And I think it's still going to change very much.

18:40.938 --> 18:43.483
Internet, I think, is going to be very important.

18:44.425 --> 18:45.867
And...

18:46.657 --> 18:50.221
They're going to work with the whole world.

18:50.381 --> 18:57.669
Do you see yourself coming to the point where you won't issue any catalogs, printed catalogs, unless everything will be electronic?

18:57.689 --> 18:58.010
Perhaps.

18:59.592 --> 19:00.252
That's possible.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.154
I don't know if it's going to be electronic.

19:03.316 --> 19:07.080
Maybe I'll send lists, but I think I'm going to send more and more lists.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.081
Without descriptions.

19:08.622 --> 19:09.923
With the descriptions.

19:10.003 --> 19:11.965
I'll show you.

19:11.985 --> 19:12.967
You'll tell me anything.

19:13.087 --> 19:14.308
You'll see how long it takes.

19:14.328 --> 19:16.090
It takes two minutes to think.

19:16.643 --> 19:18.466
So it's not going to be electronic.

19:18.787 --> 19:24.256
I'll sign the list to someone, but perhaps one day I won't even sign the list, I don't know.

19:26.019 --> 19:34.855
And if one day I have a feeling I sell more with the list than with the catalog, then I'll start the catalog, of course.

19:35.392 --> 19:38.637
With the catalogs, you depend on someone else.

19:39.319 --> 19:49.555
Chris, one of the marks of a really great bookseller has always been the production of a wonderful catalogue, and by that I mean the descriptions.

19:49.776 --> 19:50.116
I know.

19:50.177 --> 19:50.437
I know.

19:50.457 --> 19:56.507
How much weight do you put on making the description of the book?

19:56.567 --> 19:57.008
Very much.

19:57.288 --> 19:58.751
I'll show you my catalogs.

19:58.851 --> 20:00.133
We believe very much

20:00.502 --> 20:03.425
In... Researching the... Right.

20:03.445 --> 20:10.112
That's the whole reputation of the total moment is all the information we give on the book.

20:10.353 --> 20:14.937
And is this research that you do here yourself, or you have a staff that works?

20:14.957 --> 20:16.759
We have a staff, yeah.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.341
Twelve people working here.

20:18.361 --> 20:19.542
Twelve people, really.

20:19.843 --> 20:23.927
And how many work on bibliography, on the bibliographic matters?

20:24.616 --> 20:28.541
So how do you find the books, the books that you purchase?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.945
Well, we buy them from other booksellers.

20:31.085 --> 20:45.845
We go to the Ruhr, which is an auction sale, and we buy them from people who change apartments, who die, who want to lose interest.

20:45.905 --> 20:49.069
No, no, it's very seldom that they lose interest.

20:49.610 --> 20:53.475
It's either they want to buy an apartment for their child or a house,

20:54.012 --> 20:59.176
or they have to go from a big apartment to a small apartment.

21:00.237 --> 21:02.980
Or they die in the air for selling the books.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.962
Yes, exactly.

21:06.062 --> 21:08.865
It's not that they are not interested in any more people.

21:09.225 --> 21:15.110
Who are interested in books are usually always interested in books.

21:15.130 --> 21:20.915
And that's very different from the artwork.

21:20.955 --> 21:23.057
There's no speculation

21:23.273 --> 21:25.795
very little speculation on books.

21:25.815 --> 21:26.936
There's no speculation.

21:27.877 --> 21:32.481
So people... People who buy books, it's because they like books.

21:32.781 --> 21:33.922
It's not for investment.

21:35.604 --> 21:35.664
No.

21:35.684 --> 21:41.549
Very, very, very, very... Because in the United States there are people who buy for investment, which is very foolish, too.

21:41.729 --> 21:42.630
Some here, too.

21:43.010 --> 21:47.494
But when someone says, do you think it's going to go out, I always say, buy it for the pleasure.

21:47.895 --> 21:51.778
Don't ask me whether it's going to go out, because first I don't know,

21:51.910 --> 21:52.791
And nobody knows.

21:53.272 --> 21:55.876
So, I mean, what's the use of saying that?

21:55.896 --> 21:58.139
And I don't want to have that kind of customer.

21:58.379 --> 22:00.142
The customer who's looking for investment.

22:00.483 --> 22:02.866
You're interested in the bibliophile, obviously.

22:03.247 --> 22:04.468
Yes, I'm not interested.

22:04.508 --> 22:06.371
I don't want to speak about money.

22:06.471 --> 22:09.275
I always have to speak about money at the end.

22:09.916 --> 22:11.098
But it's not my problem.

22:11.118 --> 22:15.504
I don't want them to come every six months to say, so it's going up or down.

22:15.765 --> 22:16.326
You see what I mean?

22:16.346 --> 22:16.866
Like a stock.

22:16.886 --> 22:17.968
Do you have any questions for that?

22:18.134 --> 22:23.040
You mentioned that everything was going to change in 1978.

22:23.060 --> 22:23.981
That is due to Christie's and some of these?

22:24.001 --> 22:24.321
No, no, no.

22:24.341 --> 22:37.838
It's because the sales, public auction sales, I can't say it in English because it doesn't exist, were limited to a certain number of persons.

22:39.980 --> 22:40.681
I don't know if we understand that.

22:40.701 --> 22:43.384
You mean people who can come to the auction and buy?

22:43.404 --> 22:44.225
No, no, no, no.

22:44.466 --> 22:47.790
I'm saying other people who both conduct auctions.

22:47.810 --> 22:48.090
Yes.

22:48.391 --> 22:49.112
Oh, that's right.

22:49.933 --> 22:55.398
France strictly limited the people who could mount auctions.

22:55.799 --> 22:57.641
They were never able to operate in here in France.

22:57.661 --> 23:03.127
So as we are going in the common market, we have to do like the other countries.

23:03.868 --> 23:12.136
So at the end of 1997, that's going to be over.

23:12.777 --> 23:15.580
So anybody will be able to sell

23:16.167 --> 23:20.454
Books or pieces of art and so on.

23:20.934 --> 23:27.244
So prior to that, the French government restricted the sale of books to French companies, I guess, is that right?

23:27.264 --> 23:27.965
Is that what you're saying?

23:27.985 --> 23:29.948
Yes, it wasn't companies.

23:29.968 --> 23:36.718
It was, I can't say, officier ministeriel, that's a very specific French word, I can't tell you.

23:37.299 --> 23:42.828
But it wasn't, for example, it wasn't commercial firms.

23:43.609 --> 23:44.470
I see.

23:44.838 --> 23:46.761
It was something very special.

23:47.101 --> 23:54.513
So that's going to change, and that's why Sorbet and Chrissy are coming to sell.

23:55.955 --> 23:59.821
I would be able to go and sell books, too, of course.

24:00.021 --> 24:04.868
Anybody would be, as it is in England, in Germany, in Italy, and so on.

24:05.509 --> 24:07.732
It was a very specific franchise.

24:08.333 --> 24:12.820
Another interest of this new book is the...

24:13.694 --> 24:20.906
the concept of the European bookseller, the tradition of the European bookseller, which came to the United States during the war.

24:20.926 --> 24:29.340
We had many immigrate booksellers who came, and they brought this attitude, which you profess, to research that you're doing, knowing the book.

24:29.401 --> 24:32.426
It's not just acquiring a book and selling the book.

24:32.826 --> 24:35.912
It's getting a book, researching it, understanding what it is.

24:36.873 --> 24:39.718
Is there a tradition of the European bookseller

24:39.952 --> 24:40.873
Of course.

24:41.093 --> 24:43.015
Of course, and still very strong.

24:43.856 --> 24:44.897
It's still very strong.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.078
Of course, of course.

24:46.098 --> 24:53.787
When you look at the catalogs published by important firms, very fine catalogs.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.389
What, in your view, is a great bookseller?

24:56.690 --> 24:59.112
What qualities distinguish?

25:02.636 --> 25:06.600
How does one become a French bookseller, a European bookseller?

25:07.188 --> 25:15.860
Well, there's no schooling required, but something has to contribute.

25:17.102 --> 25:26.735
You know, that's very difficult to answer, because each has his own definition of what is a great bookseller.

25:28.337 --> 25:31.221
I would say, having fine books,

25:31.927 --> 25:40.617
issuing fine catalogues, often on subjects that nobody was interested in, and lots of research.

25:42.479 --> 25:52.571
I would say helping the bibliography to improve, to get better, and so on.

25:54.092 --> 25:56.936
Yes, honey.

25:56.956 --> 25:57.356
How did you succumb?

25:57.376 --> 25:58.557
Did you know that?

25:58.577 --> 25:59.318
Yes, your background.

25:59.699 --> 26:00.820
I don't know that, actually.

26:01.407 --> 26:02.288
And how did you...?

26:02.608 --> 26:08.815
Well, I... If you could give us a brief biographical... No, then I... OK.

26:10.376 --> 26:11.657
I went the other way.

26:11.738 --> 26:28.815
I was in the, what do they call, big business with the press till I was 40, and I was a book collector, and then I decided that I wanted to be a professional, so I started this shop in 1973.

26:29.335 --> 26:38.665
And the only thing that I was interested in was bibliography, because that was, when I saw a book, I didn't know anything about the book.

26:38.685 --> 26:44.651
So, I mean, you just, either you write what you find in other books, or you try to go a bit deeper.

26:46.072 --> 26:53.740
I'll give you two or three categories, and you'll see that I think that's the way we work.

26:54.631 --> 26:59.456
But, you know, everyone has his own idea of this job.

26:59.536 --> 27:03.139
I don't think there's any way that's better than another one.

27:04.981 --> 27:08.905
If you take American booksellers, they're all different.

27:08.925 --> 27:17.353
Some deal with only very expensive books, very fine books, although with not expensive.

27:17.373 --> 27:19.635
But you can't say that one is better than another.

27:19.655 --> 27:22.798
Not better, and I don't mean to use that word, but...

27:23.369 --> 27:26.953
There are some people who open bookstores by buying some books and opening the store.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.176
They don't know anything about the books that they're selling.

27:29.196 --> 27:30.598
They do very little with the research.

27:30.618 --> 27:40.009
Well, you know, even if everybody starts more or less like that, except if you've been working at a bookshop, you better know what you're speaking about.

27:40.029 --> 27:41.731
So you were in publishing prior to this?

27:41.751 --> 27:43.573
Yes, yes, in Archette.

27:43.593 --> 27:45.936
Okay, and what kinds of, were you an editor, a publisher?

27:46.557 --> 27:49.360
No, I was in marketing, I mean.

27:49.762 --> 27:52.586
And what kinds of books were you collecting?

27:52.646 --> 27:53.748
You said you were a collector.

27:54.809 --> 28:02.601
Very special books published between 1870 and the First World War.

28:05.245 --> 28:15.560
Children's books with, how do you say the first cover, you know, I don't know how to say that in English.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.925
When the first

28:19.310 --> 28:43.174
uh how do you call that not the dust no no not the dust cover i mean with the first cover gives an image of all your pictorial cloth we call it yes picture pictorial cloth exactly yes between eight let's say 1870 and bindings of course yes 1870 and 1914 yes

28:43.458 --> 28:45.981
In the United States, they did a lot of pictorial.

28:46.021 --> 28:48.644
I know you've got another interview.

28:48.684 --> 28:50.566
I can see you another time, but there.

28:53.569 --> 28:53.870
Great.

28:53.990 --> 28:58.214
Can you recommend any people that we, other people who might see while we're here this trip?

28:58.234 --> 29:00.477
We'll probably be coming back to Paris.

29:00.497 --> 29:04.221
The problem is... They're all on holiday.

29:04.762 --> 29:06.343
No, it's... No, no, no, no, no.

29:06.363 --> 29:08.706
I don't know who speaks English.

29:09.867 --> 29:16.454
Do you have a catalogue of the books, do you use?

29:18.215 --> 29:18.516
Yes.

29:18.856 --> 29:21.158
I don't know who speaks English.

29:23.621 --> 29:27.264
How about collectors that I might make contact with?

29:27.605 --> 29:29.647
Can you recommend any interesting collectors?

29:29.947 --> 29:33.891
I know I've heard the name Henri Chelaire is a great collector.

29:34.011 --> 29:34.211
Yes.

29:34.411 --> 29:39.216
Well, he's a big collector of Incunabula.

29:39.584 --> 29:42.086
Is he difficult to get in touch with, or do you think?

29:42.166 --> 29:43.868
Is he easy to get in touch with?

29:44.869 --> 29:45.609
I can try.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.191
I can try.

29:47.231 --> 29:48.872
I don't know if he's in Paris now.

29:50.934 --> 29:51.875
Or I could call him.

29:52.556 --> 29:55.338
No, I'm going to ask him if he agrees.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.139
I can't give you anything.

29:56.159 --> 30:02.385
I wrote him a letter a couple of weeks ago, and I didn't hear back, but I know it was just a couple of weeks ago.

30:02.465 --> 30:03.826
And he knows of my book.

30:04.667 --> 30:08.190
And that's small books.

30:08.947 --> 30:13.058
of small prices, let's say less than more reasonable.

30:13.900 --> 30:21.420
I wouldn't say more, but more or less under 2,000 francs.

30:21.586 --> 30:28.920
This kind, I'm giving you two of them, there's always varia and a special something.

30:28.960 --> 30:34.170
This was special history, and this was erotic books.

30:34.190 --> 30:38.619
So there's always a certain number of books on the subject and varia.

30:38.719 --> 30:41.805
I'm giving you two, so once it's like that...

30:42.157 --> 30:59.237
and this is what we call expensive books on bibliophilia and for example you see when you said do you need to write something that's what i call a that's what i call a real uh thing you see all this an extensive uh entry
