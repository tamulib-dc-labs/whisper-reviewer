WEBVTT

00:01.347 --> 00:03.550
And my audience is your audience.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.671
Oh, this will be great.

00:04.992 --> 00:07.054
I'll have them sent to you.

00:07.354 --> 00:09.197
It would be in everybody's best interest.

00:09.217 --> 00:09.657
No, no, no.

00:09.757 --> 00:11.019
You'll see what I mean.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.062
Oh, I'd be so grateful.

00:13.082 --> 00:14.563
You'll see what I mean.

00:14.684 --> 00:17.627
Read the editor's stories in each issue.

00:17.647 --> 00:22.213
Here, let me show you what it looks like.

00:22.233 --> 00:23.114
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:23.274 --> 00:26.058
Look at this.

00:26.078 --> 00:27.800
This is a series.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.582
Yeah, this is a series.

00:30.575 --> 00:32.497
When did it start?

00:33.618 --> 00:36.280
We're going into our second year.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.802
And how often is it?

00:37.842 --> 00:38.662
A quarterly.

00:38.682 --> 00:40.544
We're going to go bi-monthly.

00:40.564 --> 00:40.784
Wow.

00:41.965 --> 00:42.946
Oh, I'm thrilled.

00:42.966 --> 00:44.548
This is so important.

00:44.568 --> 00:45.228
I'll learn about it.

00:45.528 --> 00:46.629
You'll see what I mean.

00:46.830 --> 00:53.135
Oh, look at the, this is a cool world.

00:54.416 --> 00:59.161
Let it be, boy.

00:59.221 --> 01:00.582
Oh, this looks wonderful.

01:01.203 --> 01:06.931
Tell me, by the way, when I'm running.

01:07.111 --> 01:10.215
I'll have every copy sent to you.

01:10.315 --> 01:10.896
Will you?

01:10.916 --> 01:11.197
Yeah.

01:11.657 --> 01:12.258
I'll write about it.

01:12.799 --> 01:13.260
Great.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.201
I promise.

01:16.404 --> 01:18.607
The tape is back on.

01:21.811 --> 01:28.240
Could you talk a little bit about

01:28.810 --> 01:32.435
You mentioned how William Parallels Williams changed your life.

01:33.496 --> 01:37.682
Oh, you'll see it in that book.

01:38.463 --> 01:42.047
I wrote my thesis on the first two books of Patterson.

01:42.748 --> 01:49.637
I got to meet him, I went on rounds with him, and I think if I hadn't met him,

01:50.174 --> 01:58.283
I would have gone on to become a high school English teacher, which is what I envisioned myself as doing when I was a college senior.

01:58.804 --> 02:06.052
Instead I went and took pre-med courses to try to follow his lead, at least the doctoring side of his life.

02:06.113 --> 02:08.455
I never thought that I'd ever do any writing.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.279
I pictured myself becoming a doctor.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.964
And it was hard because I was not a very good pre-med student.

02:15.984 --> 02:19.388
I had majored in English.

02:19.688 --> 02:24.373
Somehow I got through medical school and then went into pediatrics.

02:25.073 --> 02:28.797
But I kept visiting him, and he was an enormous influence on me.

02:28.817 --> 02:38.166
And when I started doing my research, I'd send him some of the articles, and he'd write back and say for kind of loud, speak English!

02:39.507 --> 02:49.577
Write for all of us folks out here, instead of he was attacking, in other words, the technical jargon of psychiatry and psychoanalysis.

02:49.912 --> 02:54.798
He wanted me to write clearly for ordinary people, as you called them.

02:54.818 --> 03:00.165
Which is something we continually see in professional academic writing, isn't it?

03:00.186 --> 03:04.992
I see so many books published by universities that have so much promise, just by the title.

03:05.973 --> 03:06.093
Right.

03:06.374 --> 03:08.877
And then you pick it up and you go, hey boy!

03:09.037 --> 03:16.527
Yeah, it's a sad— They're either talking to their colleagues and to a very few choice people.

03:16.810 --> 03:21.037
It's a pity, because there is so much good material there to share.

03:21.578 --> 03:22.540
That's right.

03:22.760 --> 03:30.974
But is it just coincidental that also, I mean, William's position, writer, yourself, position, writer.

03:30.994 --> 03:33.038
Walker Percy's position, writer.

03:33.058 --> 03:35.823
Is there something there that we do?

03:35.863 --> 03:37.325
Well, I think there is.

03:37.445 --> 03:41.873
There are some of us who do that as well.

03:42.595 --> 03:49.882
And I think it's no accident that both of them have meant so much to me, and that I've followed them with such a— Have you given any thought?

03:50.022 --> 04:10.662
I mean, what is there that— I think I just am taken by their moral energy and their ability to not only—their ability to—you know, I think both of them address as physicians

04:11.097 --> 04:15.882
the moral question of, what does life mean?

04:17.484 --> 04:25.492
That's what a physician, not only wants to heal someone, but is face to face with these existentialist questions.

04:26.413 --> 04:40.868
I think for some of us, this becomes a pride to our writing life, because we face hurt and the pain of people, and like all of us, we wonder, why is this?

04:41.067 --> 04:50.181
and how what we lived, especially given the vulnerability of all of us, since we're all going to die anyway.

04:50.201 --> 04:56.751
So I think maybe there's that existentialist side of medicine that the writer will connect with.

04:59.496 --> 05:08.830
You mentioned the phrase deconstructionism earlier, you know, and then of course you've had the opportunity to know Williams and to know Prissy and also to know that it worked.

05:09.181 --> 05:23.402
Have you learned different things from these people as individuals, as opposed to their writing, or is it, again, something that... In both of those instances, you know, sometimes you get to know people... I don't know if I'm phrasing the question, but I think... No, I know what you're saying.

05:23.482 --> 05:29.591
Sometimes you get to know people and you're disappointed in them, even though they're well-known and have been very successful.

05:30.172 --> 05:34.939
I was not disappointed in either of those individuals.

05:36.221 --> 05:38.985
Did they amplify in life what you learned from their books?

05:39.117 --> 05:44.764
The more I knew them, the more I learned about their books as well as about them.

05:44.844 --> 05:49.410
And that, I think, is probably the highest compliment a reader can pay a writer.

05:49.430 --> 05:51.072
Just say it once more, if you would.

05:51.212 --> 06:07.892
The more I got to know them as individuals, the more impressed I was with not only the nature of their lives, but the more I learned from those lives about them as writers, and the more I learned about the meaning of their book,

06:09.020 --> 06:19.176
So, there was a continuity and a connection between their individual lives and their writing lives, which I have found very impressive.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.241
And in a way, that's what your letter shows.

06:24.104 --> 06:36.664
That letter shows Walker Percy as a deeply concerned and responsive human being, trying to connect with someone who has reached out to him, offering him

06:36.982 --> 06:40.828
you know, whatever responsiveness he has.

06:40.948 --> 06:46.557
And you know, he wasn't doing this for anyone's benefit but that particular person.

06:46.577 --> 06:49.100
And just by circumstances came into my possession.

06:50.242 --> 06:56.892
There's something that you can, that letter belongs in The Movie Goer and in The Last Gentleman.

06:57.333 --> 07:02.360
That letter is an aspect of what he's writing about in both of those novels.

07:02.821 --> 07:05.385
I mean, what happens at the end of The Last Gentleman?

07:06.040 --> 07:10.600
Now, Will Bowers running after that doctor.

07:11.069 --> 07:13.191
And they're trying to come back.

07:13.492 --> 07:23.063
And at the end of the moviegoer, you know, Binks is saying, here we are, we hand one another along, and that letter is, you know, the— I hadn't made that leap.

07:23.323 --> 07:24.124
No, no, no.

07:24.565 --> 07:26.767
That letter belongs in those books.

07:26.787 --> 07:28.850
And I wonder if I had it tucked into that.

07:28.870 --> 07:36.979
Well, whether we knew it consciously or not, it's one of those wonderful, fateful moments that a good novelist would always offer us.

07:38.501 --> 07:38.721
Wow.

07:39.122 --> 07:40.283
I didn't mean to—

07:40.567 --> 07:44.774
take you away from the track that you might have been on, knowing them and knowing their works.

07:44.794 --> 07:49.321
Knowing them and knowing their works, and knowing them helped me know their work even more.

07:50.382 --> 07:53.227
Because, you know, they both lived this hour.

07:53.247 --> 07:58.114
Walker struggled with the death, the suicide of his father, of his grandfather.

07:58.575 --> 08:01.680
He struggled with illness that could have killed him, tuberculosis.

08:01.700 --> 08:08.110
He knew what it meant to be an orphan at the age of thirteen or fourteen.

08:08.393 --> 08:21.746
He knew what it was to suddenly be sidetracked by a potentially fatal illness, and out of this came the moral introspection that enabled these novels.

08:21.766 --> 08:23.668
He tells you that in the letter, too.

08:24.929 --> 08:35.599
And Williams, you know, Williams spent his life working with poor people in Patterson who had nothing but what he – they had nothing

08:35.748 --> 09:00.490
by the standards of social and economic indices, but they had vitality, they had rhythms of language, they had an energy which he appreciated and responded to, and as a writer invoked and offered to the rest of us a huge gift, a huge gift to us readers, to understand

09:01.077 --> 09:08.086
the story of Patterson, which is where the first factory in America was built.

09:08.106 --> 09:08.947
I didn't know that.

09:08.967 --> 09:09.388
Yeah.

09:09.408 --> 09:11.230
I'm from Lowell, originally, of course.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.452
First factory in America.

09:12.472 --> 09:12.752
Oh, yeah.

09:13.353 --> 09:28.452
And out of all—I mean, he gave us the story of America in Patterson, in poetry and also in prose, because there were very important prose sections of Patterson.

09:28.820 --> 09:35.309
You know, I asked Harold Bloom, because he brought her up at one point, the famous Desert Island book.

09:35.930 --> 09:41.657
He's the one person, I said, is there anything that you wanted to read that you've never read?

09:41.677 --> 09:45.162
I said, nobody's asked me that, because of course I said, I've read everything.

09:45.222 --> 09:46.544
How many people can say that?

09:46.584 --> 09:53.373
He's actually had a heart attack and bleeding ulcers because he can't sleep and he reads all night.

09:53.393 --> 09:57.038
But what book would he take with him to the Desert Island, you know?

09:57.473 --> 10:03.321
And I guess he said, well, it would have to be either Shakespeare or the King James Bible or the Hebrew Bible.

10:04.343 --> 10:06.086
Have you ever given thought about what books?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.407
Only one book?

10:08.068 --> 10:09.070
Well, I give you three or four.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.272
Give me three or four.

10:11.754 --> 10:16.140
I would take War and Peace.

10:16.160 --> 10:16.441
Really?

10:16.761 --> 10:18.183
Yeah.

10:18.203 --> 10:20.567
I would take War and Peace.

10:20.587 --> 10:25.033
I would take Middlemarch.

10:26.161 --> 10:29.344
I would take Middlemarch.

10:29.445 --> 10:32.568
I would take War and Peace.

10:48.886 --> 10:51.949
I would take the Bernanos, the Dietary of the Country Priest.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.203
Now these are books you're going to read over and over again.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.907
I do read them over and over again.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.751
I've read one piece three times.

11:02.771 --> 11:05.795
And what is it about those particular characters?

11:05.815 --> 11:11.662
I think they are filled with wisdom, and they would give me the kind of perspective I'd need on it.

11:11.682 --> 11:12.463
That's an island.

11:12.943 --> 11:13.784
To keep going.

11:13.804 --> 11:14.525
To keep going.

11:15.927 --> 11:16.248
Wow.

11:16.668 --> 11:20.893
How about if I pushed it to five, did you put a couple more of them?

11:20.973 --> 11:21.334
If what?

11:21.434 --> 11:23.877
If I said you could take five books.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.916
I like the way this is going.

11:33.663 --> 11:46.360
I just feel you're prioritizing for me, which is very interesting.

11:46.380 --> 11:52.768
I would take Salone's Bread and Wine, which I teach and love.

11:52.788 --> 11:54.370
I should send you my reading list.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.753
Because those are basically the books that I do.

11:56.773 --> 11:58.075
You're reading it from school?

11:58.095 --> 11:59.557
Yeah, from my course.

12:00.438 --> 12:00.998
I'm sorry.

12:01.279 --> 12:02.440
No, no, no.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.502
This is for a book, by the way.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.264
I love doing this.

12:05.284 --> 12:06.286
I'll send you a reading book.

12:06.706 --> 12:06.906
Would you?

12:06.926 --> 12:09.510
Would you see my book, which you'll get tomorrow.

12:09.530 --> 12:10.752
When are you leaving for North Carolina?

12:11.573 --> 12:12.013
Next week?

12:12.414 --> 12:13.015
Next week.

12:13.035 --> 12:16.299
Okay, I'll mail the thing today, because I'm going to go to the first book.

12:16.339 --> 12:17.220
I would take bread and wine.

12:17.260 --> 12:20.605
I would take, and I'd take the moviegoer.

12:21.246 --> 12:23.108
No, in fact, I'd take the last gentleman.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.912
Over the moviegoer.

12:24.932 --> 12:28.877
Well, if you really pushed me, I'd take The Last Gentleman over the moviegoer.

12:28.897 --> 12:30.539
Do you think that's his greatest book?

12:30.679 --> 12:34.283
It's not his greatest book, but it's his wisest.

12:34.303 --> 12:38.769
It's a further development of the kind of wisdom that gave us the moviegoer.

12:38.789 --> 12:45.437
I think literary critics, using their criteria, would tell us that the moviegoer is a better novel, quotes, unquote.

12:45.657 --> 12:52.285
But I'm responding, you see, out of my heart, in my own situation of a desert island,

12:53.311 --> 12:53.972
I love this.

12:55.134 --> 13:10.495
I'd also take, frankly, and I should take his, you know, The Message in the Bottle, because one of the essays is about a man standing that does an island trying to figure out the meaning of life and hoping for a message.

13:10.515 --> 13:15.201
You know, the metaphor is that this earth is an island.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.465
And they were looking for some meaning, you know, some bottle wall.

13:19.525 --> 13:21.188
That's the message of the wall precisely.

13:21.208 --> 13:21.588
Yeah.

13:21.608 --> 13:38.250
And then, of course, the Thanatos Syndrome, the metaphor there is that he's up in the woods looking for fires, again, trying to protect and trying to... The reason I didn't give you, in a way, the stock answers, which would be the Bible and Shakespeare and whatever is... I don't know if it was wonderful.

13:38.671 --> 13:42.876
...is because I'm trying to tell you that

13:44.813 --> 13:47.756
I'm trying to give you books that I live by, you know.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.039
And that goes back to what we were saying.

13:50.159 --> 13:51.520
What we were talking about.

13:51.681 --> 13:54.364
I'm looking for a quote here that I pulled out of a P.W.

13:54.464 --> 13:57.347
interview you did about six or seven years ago.

13:57.367 --> 13:58.008
Oh, yeah.

13:58.048 --> 13:58.769
Thank you.

13:58.909 --> 14:02.573
About how novelists are, how you live with novelists.

14:02.833 --> 14:03.354
Yeah.

14:03.374 --> 14:07.959
And otherwise it was that one quote there, and I would just kind of like to expand on that a little bit, you know.

14:08.159 --> 14:09.881
I wouldn't have the exact quote to read to you.

14:09.901 --> 14:14.466
I feel you'll see it on the call of stories, but I consider novelists companions.

14:15.053 --> 14:18.256
in this life of search for meaning.

14:18.757 --> 14:29.208
They are people who are wise observers of the human scene, and I find their wisdom terribly important and helpful.

14:29.268 --> 14:44.183
And I read what they have to say, not only to be entertained and to be amused and to be engaged in that sense, but I feel that some of them move, as God reminded us, from the aesthetic plane to the moral plane.

14:44.602 --> 14:53.613
And they do so in a way that is gripping and engaging and potentially life-changing.

14:55.795 --> 14:59.039
I mean, I have just been re-reading The Magic Mountain.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.262
I saw it.

15:01.282 --> 15:04.406
I was going to ask you about it next to the Bonhoeffer book.

15:04.566 --> 15:14.558
I've been reading The Magic Mountain, and I read it years ago, but I'm once again caught up in that world that Thomas Mann creates.

15:14.909 --> 15:27.644
which is a world of the intellect, yes, but it's also a moral, it's the universe examined morally and exposed morally.

15:27.885 --> 15:43.043
And I find it, you know, it's just an enchanting experience to be summoned this way by another human being, Thomas Mann, into this kind of reflection, which is basically moral and spiritual reflections.

15:43.732 --> 15:47.562
Do you read any contemporary novels in your books?

15:48.885 --> 15:49.066
Yeah.

15:53.277 --> 15:56.204
I love, do you know Alice Elliot Dark?

15:56.345 --> 15:56.766
I know.

15:56.826 --> 15:58.450
She's a short story writer.

15:58.784 --> 16:04.670
She did a wonderful story in New York about a man dying of AIDS.

16:05.911 --> 16:09.255
Tobias Wolfe, I love his short fiction.

16:09.275 --> 16:11.136
You just have a new collection already.

16:11.156 --> 16:13.459
Yeah, I love his fiction.

16:13.719 --> 16:18.844
I love Richard Ford's fiction, the short stories.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.526
I love Independence Day.

16:20.566 --> 16:23.869
Carver, I teach.

16:24.029 --> 16:27.593
Obviously, yeah, but he's recently, what was that?

16:28.619 --> 16:35.690
Ford, Wolfe, Alice Elliott-Dark.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.154
I said Alice Elliott, G-A-R-K.

16:38.574 --> 16:39.937
G-A-R-K.

16:40.337 --> 16:42.861
She's had one question for her.

16:43.021 --> 16:45.525
I'll check her out, yeah.

16:45.545 --> 16:49.311
And then there's republished and double-take, you read a couple of her stories.

16:50.084 --> 16:56.171
Well, tell me how you get into this double-take thing.

16:56.611 --> 17:07.623
Oh, a couple years ago we got very—there is no way that the visual side is connected to the textual side.

17:07.923 --> 17:11.507
There's no outlet for good narrative photography.

17:12.709 --> 17:15.872
And I'll send you—if you read the reader's stories,

17:16.072 --> 17:23.984
And I'll send you a piece that I wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education that tells you the story of the magazine and how it got going.

17:24.084 --> 17:29.712
In fact, it has to do with my wife as an elementary and secondary school teacher.

17:29.732 --> 17:31.274
This is not going to be for this newspaper.

17:31.294 --> 17:33.898
I'm going to send you a huge copy of this book.

17:35.901 --> 17:36.802
This is remarkable.

17:37.183 --> 17:42.130
This is great.

17:42.565 --> 17:46.411
I see over there, I didn't see before, Joe DiMaggio and Lou Gehrig.

17:46.651 --> 17:47.712
Yeah.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.235
So you're a baseball fan.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.760
My father used to take me to baseball games all the time.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.021
He was the fan.

17:54.923 --> 17:55.063
Uh-huh.

17:55.083 --> 18:00.991
And they were his—that picture originally was my five, yeah.

18:01.012 --> 18:04.657
And when he died, you know, it's my way of connecting with him.

18:05.077 --> 18:06.900
That's wonderful.

18:06.960 --> 18:12.488
They were my parents over there.

18:12.755 --> 18:40.011
Yeah, I think it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.

18:40.328 --> 18:46.954
There are many other rooms.

18:47.214 --> 18:48.675
I have a library about the side.

18:48.755 --> 18:51.698
I have a basement where I can show you.

18:51.718 --> 18:53.399
It's unbelievable!

18:53.419 --> 18:59.044
Yeah, I'm going to have a—because really in this concluding section of my new book, the future of the book.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.945
Do you think about that at all?

19:00.965 --> 19:10.133
Oh, I hope that people will get to meet the people who—I mean, when you read a book, you're meeting a fellow human being.

19:10.771 --> 19:15.939
You're meeting another life, and it's received wisdom, which is offered to you in the book.

19:16.781 --> 19:20.266
A book, I keep repeating, is a form of companionship.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.969
It's a human experience.

19:23.131 --> 19:32.446
And even if you don't read this, getting back to what you were talking about, correcting books, this is your way of engaging the spirit of these books.

19:32.787 --> 19:34.530
You don't have to read every word of them.

19:35.351 --> 19:36.593
Well, Churchill said, is it?

19:37.028 --> 19:41.514
necessary to have read all 50,000 books in my library so you can talk to me.

19:41.534 --> 19:43.557
He said, no, but make them your friends.

19:43.577 --> 19:44.518
Know what you have.

19:44.738 --> 19:46.340
Know where they are when you need them.

19:47.141 --> 19:48.022
And how they can help you.

19:48.163 --> 19:51.527
And I call upon them in all the rooms in this house.

19:51.787 --> 19:52.468
And they're alive.

19:52.769 --> 20:04.424
Have you heard of this notion called hypertext and all this stuff with computers where there's interactivity where the reader can actually go in and change the story?

20:04.484 --> 20:06.867
I mean, this is what

20:07.184 --> 20:09.146
Well, that's right.

20:09.227 --> 20:13.772
I mean, there's a new book I'll call The Future of the Book from the University of California Press.

20:13.792 --> 20:14.633
I have two copies.

20:14.653 --> 20:16.996
I'll send you one, if you're at all interested.

20:17.156 --> 20:18.378
No, I'll order it.

20:18.398 --> 20:20.160
I don't want to say that.

20:20.180 --> 20:32.415
I've got one all marked up, because there was a big seminar, and it was Alberto Eco's group out in California, and there were all these people, and this one fellow talks about hypertext, which is

20:33.037 --> 20:35.522
Oh yeah, like a novelist.

20:35.803 --> 20:41.575
Yeah, and it's constantly changing, and the readers can go in.

20:41.716 --> 20:45.544
And of course, because you can call these things up on computers.

20:47.127 --> 20:48.730
And there is no sacred text.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.775
Well, you know, I think we do this as readers all the time.

20:51.795 --> 20:53.277
We do, but that's fine.

20:53.357 --> 20:56.843
But you can't go change the text of what the writer has written.

20:56.863 --> 20:59.427
Well, you change it in your mind.

21:00.349 --> 21:09.123
But what you do is, it filters through your sensibility, and you write notes to yourself, or don't, but you absorb it in your own particular way.

21:09.203 --> 21:10.906
That I agree with.

21:11.407 --> 21:12.990
I mean, I don't agree with it.

21:13.030 --> 21:13.911
It happens.

21:14.414 --> 21:17.899
But to change it for other people, no.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.503
Yeah.

21:20.523 --> 21:21.906
And how will books be written?

21:21.986 --> 21:24.890
How will they be accessed?

21:24.910 --> 21:31.220
Well, I hope they'll always be available to us to sit and read it.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.883
Yeah.

21:32.903 --> 21:37.009
I don't want to take up too much of your time, but how long are you going to be in North Carolina?

21:37.229 --> 21:38.311
Just for a couple of months.

21:38.491 --> 21:42.317
Do you have an address down here, I reckon?

21:42.738 --> 21:42.818
Yes.

21:43.490 --> 21:50.879
I'll send the book here to you immediately today.

21:51.040 --> 21:58.469
I think this has been a really good session.

22:00.532 --> 22:05.498
What I'd like to do is go transcribe this tape.
