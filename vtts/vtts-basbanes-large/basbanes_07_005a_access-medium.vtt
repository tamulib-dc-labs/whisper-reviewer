WEBVTT

00:03.355 --> 00:11.768
And do we call this by its initials, the URL, as in HRC in Texas?

00:12.129 --> 00:18.398
Well, on campus, yes, people know that, but I don't think it's nationally known as the URL.

00:18.438 --> 00:24.688
We are generic, the Department of Special Collections, the University Research Library, and

00:25.175 --> 00:28.578
As of now, we don't have a name attached to it.

00:29.339 --> 00:33.523
HRC is actually HRHRC, right?

00:33.603 --> 00:35.765
Even Harry's name is on the building.

00:35.805 --> 00:39.229
A lot of people think that he had that in mind.

00:39.929 --> 00:40.210
Right.

00:42.532 --> 00:52.802
But as I started to say, I think we are a young university, first of all, and I think that's one of the reasons that perhaps

00:53.457 --> 01:04.229
UCLA isn't thought of, as I said before, in the same breath with Houghton or Beinecke or the great private libraries like Morgan or Newberry.

01:05.550 --> 01:22.148
But when you think of just the breadth of the collections alone, and I can give you numbers if you want to start with numbers, okay, more than 300,000 rare books, approximately 25 million manuscripts,

01:23.461 --> 01:25.283
five million photographs.

01:26.804 --> 01:30.628
And the manuscripts are in approximately 2,000 collections.

01:32.750 --> 01:45.021
So, I came here in 84, and I felt one of my major tasks was to publicize what this library has to offer.

01:46.082 --> 01:50.987
And so, we have embarked on a program of publications, and I'll be glad to give you

01:51.153 --> 01:53.415
any of the ones that appeal to you.

01:53.535 --> 01:57.219
There's a case full of them outside the door.

01:57.779 --> 01:58.800
Well, that's okay.

01:59.121 --> 02:00.882
I'd be happy if that helped.

02:01.823 --> 02:07.929
But I felt that scholars need to know more about the resources that are here.

02:08.750 --> 02:21.042
We have become the second city of America, notwithstanding the outcome of the basketball game last night, and a major research hub.

02:21.325 --> 02:34.283
I mean, I think you're here and you're seeing not only UCLA, but I assume you either have interviewed before or will interview people at the Huntington, people at the Getty, USC, etc.

02:34.323 --> 02:44.016
This is a cultural community that I think is sometimes overlooked because of Hollywood, the film industry, and so forth.

02:44.096 --> 02:47.080
But this is a very strong cultural community.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.950
And UCLA has played a part in that since the 1920s.

02:52.371 --> 02:55.535
And that's when this campus was really established.

02:55.935 --> 02:57.997
I can go into some of the history.

02:58.017 --> 03:14.873
But I think the main thing that I want to point out is that this has all happened in... This campus was opened in 1929, about three or four weeks before the crash of the stock market.

03:15.038 --> 03:16.519
It really is.

03:16.660 --> 03:20.483
When you said young, I thought you were saying like 100 years, which is... No, well, all right.

03:21.024 --> 03:24.647
What happened was Berkeley was established in 1868.

03:26.669 --> 03:40.523
By the turn of the century, there was enough application for admission to University of California from people in the south part of California that the regents decided they needed another campus.

03:41.448 --> 03:48.355
So in 1919, they established what they called the Southern Branch of the University of California.

03:49.155 --> 03:53.400
And this was closer to downtown on Vermont Avenue.

03:54.841 --> 04:05.912
And then this campus was planned and the first four buildings of it were constructed between 1925 and 1929.

04:06.352 --> 04:11.337
And the campus here on the west end of town opened in 1929.

04:12.532 --> 04:15.214
There have been five university librarians.

04:15.675 --> 04:17.556
Only one of them is still not living.

04:18.457 --> 04:19.638
It is not living now.

04:19.938 --> 04:29.907
I mean, everything that has happened, I could run off a dozen names of people, and they're all still alive, you know, and they're all still doing things.

04:29.947 --> 04:42.538
The first head of special collections, Neil Harlow, just published a book on mapping of California, and he was head of special collections from 1946 to 1952.

04:43.379 --> 04:57.719
So I think this is, you know, it's sort of like that adage about hard science where 99% of all the great discoveries in science have been made by people who are still living, you know, that kind of thing.

04:57.739 --> 05:11.918
And you think back to Copernicus and all of the greats in the history of science, and we kind of feel that way at UCLA as well about the library, that it's all happened in a very short period of time.

05:11.982 --> 05:14.065
It is interesting that the decision was made.

05:14.966 --> 05:27.803
Apparently, from the outset, and I'll correct me if I'm wrong, but in addition to having a southern branch, as you call it, you also saw the need for establishing really important special collections.

05:28.003 --> 05:33.650
Well, again, this is the heart of it, too, because this is where I think it gets really interesting.

05:34.471 --> 05:41.280
Lawrence Clark Powell, who was our second university librarian, began work here under John Goodwin,

05:41.699 --> 05:45.725
the first librarian in the middle 1930s.

05:45.826 --> 05:52.616
And the first job that Larry Powell had here was to catalog the Californiana collection.

05:52.636 --> 05:54.199
So this is around 1935, 1936.

05:56.943 --> 06:08.922
Larry became university librarian in 1943, and by 1946 had amassed enough material where special collections, which was a lacked room up until then,

06:09.593 --> 06:15.458
was large enough to have its own department with its own reference desk and that sort of thing.

06:16.599 --> 06:21.043
And so that was when the department was formally established.

06:21.063 --> 06:30.551
And Larry and his successor, Bob Vosper, who was another great university librarian here, were bookmen.

06:31.051 --> 06:35.315
And they really amassed collections, but it was always a struggle.

06:35.415 --> 06:38.638
Larry, in fortune and friendship,

06:39.108 --> 06:50.058
in that part of my graphical work, said at one point that he was always going begging up north, and so was UCLA.

06:50.639 --> 06:56.644
Larry's line was, Berkeley gets support in yards, UCLA gets support in inches.

06:57.705 --> 07:03.711
And it wasn't until Franklin Murphy became chancellor in 1960 that UCLA really blossomed.

07:04.371 --> 07:08.575
So the campus was established 60 years ago,

07:09.247 --> 07:17.897
two years ago, but it was really only about 30 years ago that UCLA really came into its own, and it was really Franklin Murphy's doing.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.200
And you said go begging up north, you mean Sacramento.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.141
Yeah, yeah.

07:21.161 --> 07:21.721
For state money.

07:21.901 --> 07:24.645
But then in fact, who might be up north?

07:24.665 --> 07:29.831
No, no, for state funding, for equitable funding between the campuses.

07:29.891 --> 07:37.279
In the meantime, the legislature and the regents of the University of California were establishing seven other campuses.

07:37.934 --> 07:49.574
There are nine University of California's now in the state, and Berkeley and UCLA are the largest two, but there are other major campuses as well.

07:49.754 --> 07:52.880
Do you feel you've surpassed Berkeley and Special Collections?

07:52.900 --> 07:53.140
No.

07:53.441 --> 07:55.244
Have you equal them?

07:55.404 --> 08:01.174
I think when youâ€”in fairness to everybody, Special Collections are not really

08:01.458 --> 08:04.501
comparable because everybody has unique material.

08:04.521 --> 08:11.749
You can deal with it quantitatively, and Berkeley is still bigger in numbers of materials.

08:11.829 --> 08:15.553
I think their manuscript count is pushing 50 million, something like that.

08:16.754 --> 08:23.641
But I would say we are comparable in our readership, in what we're trying to do.

08:23.681 --> 08:25.343
We work very closely together.

08:25.463 --> 08:31.009
We don't think of ourselves really as rivals anymore the way it was in Powell's time, where

08:31.462 --> 08:41.633
and in the early days of Franklin Murphy's tenure as the chancellor, but back then there was competition.

08:41.693 --> 08:45.396
How come Berkeley gets all this and we only get this and so forth?

08:45.416 --> 08:51.923
And Murphy was the one who really put this campus on par with Berkeley.

08:51.943 --> 08:53.465
And our programs are different.

08:53.705 --> 08:55.347
I mean, we have a medical school.

08:55.387 --> 08:56.128
They don't.

08:56.468 --> 09:01.333
Their medical school is University of California, San Francisco, which is across the Bay.

09:01.972 --> 09:08.222
And so it's very hard to make line-for-line comparisons.

09:08.242 --> 09:14.692
But I would think that we are holding our own now, and we are not in the shadow of them any longer.

09:14.712 --> 09:17.115
Do you collect similar things?

09:17.256 --> 09:20.080
I mean, are there... I would... Go ahead.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.163
That they would go after, that you'd go after as well?

09:24.387 --> 09:28.553
Not really anymore, because we're really trying to cooperate.

09:28.938 --> 09:31.341
We both have Californiana collections.

09:31.441 --> 09:51.145
We have a tacit agreement that says that we will collect principally south of the Tehachapi mountain range, and they will collect principally north of the Tehachapi, so that we are covering the state regionally, but there are certainly things that are pertinent to the whole state that both of us will want.

09:52.868 --> 09:55.671
Our heads of collection development have

09:56.292 --> 10:18.655
sit on a collection development council that is a nine campus council and they are working very hard especially in hard financial times to get more formalized cooperative collection development but we've always talked to one another when it comes to special collections we do the same thing with the getty uh huntington usc locally

10:18.905 --> 10:23.050
so that we're not tripping over each other at auctions and so forth.

10:23.330 --> 10:29.718
Our attitude within Los Angeles is if there's something important, it ought to be in Los Angeles.

10:30.599 --> 10:41.531
And it's becoming less and less important who actually owns it as much as the fact that the resource needs to be here and we have cooperative research facilities and so forth.

10:41.932 --> 10:47.258
An example of that, the Getty Center uses our online

10:47.693 --> 10:49.155
system called Orion.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.318
They are hardwired into it.

10:52.720 --> 11:07.402
The quid pro quo for it was that they put up the money for us to convert our card catalog as completely as possible to the online system.

11:07.422 --> 11:14.612
So, in effect, our library online catalog is their library online catalog now, and their scholars

11:15.402 --> 11:20.109
and their staff have, in effect, faculty status and faculty privileges here.

11:20.169 --> 11:22.953
That's the kind of cooperation I'm talking about.

11:23.534 --> 11:27.860
Then we get into areas of what are you collecting, what are we collecting?

11:27.880 --> 11:32.586
Well, let's just take what... I'll skip around to the Huntington for a second.

11:32.967 --> 11:36.973
Sorry.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.502
Dr. Murthy was very interested in early Italian printing.

11:43.837 --> 11:51.108
And that's become one of our great collections, a collection of world renown.

11:52.591 --> 11:58.079
And we've been buying a lot of 15th and 16th century Italian books.

11:58.099 --> 12:00.242
Well, we talked to the Huntington.

12:00.302 --> 12:06.272
The Getty isn't collecting this area so much except for iconographical items.

12:06.332 --> 12:11.700
And even there, we're not really overlapping much at all.

12:12.102 --> 12:21.031
We talked to the Huntington, and the Huntington has got probably the second greatest collection of 15th century books in the country after the Library of Congress.

12:22.012 --> 12:24.995
So we're not duplicating what they already have.

12:25.396 --> 12:34.686
These are expensive books, and what's the point of us having the same thing at UCLA, which 20 miles away is at the Huntington?

12:35.326 --> 12:38.970
So first and foremost, we're not duplicating their Italian holdings.

12:39.558 --> 12:47.869
Secondly, they are pretty much not buying anything more Italian because they know we are, so they're concentrating in German books of the jury.

12:49.131 --> 12:50.773
That's what we're trying to do.

12:50.813 --> 13:07.135
And I think when you're in a young community like Los Angeles, there's more of an opportunity to do that sort of cooperative collecting than perhaps there is in the East where you look at Harvard, 300 years old or plus, and...

13:07.486 --> 13:12.593
However, I was just going to say, I've heard the same thing in Boston.

13:12.733 --> 13:21.525
Well, Roger Stoddard will say, hey, the BPL is collecting whatever, and he'll call Laura Marty over at Boston Public Library and say, are you interested in this?

13:21.845 --> 13:28.174
Because they have a few collections which overlap, but really their interest is in serving the scholar in this little area.

13:28.194 --> 13:33.481
And if you have to go across town, fine, as long as the material is in the community.

13:33.541 --> 13:37.206
Yeah, and I think, in fairness to them, I didn't mean to disparage

13:37.507 --> 13:44.453
Roger, Harvard, or Boston, but I think everybody is doing that now.

13:44.473 --> 14:06.653
I think we're all coming to see, when you look at general collection material, the price of serial subscriptions, the price of reference books are getting so expensive that I think we're all at the point that we're having to share collections, we're having to establish issues of ownership

14:07.240 --> 14:20.257
who will own what, and then who will have access to that if the other person is agreeing, no, I won't own that if you will let me come and see yours, and in return, I will concentrate in this area and do that.

14:20.317 --> 14:33.613
I think every major metropolitan community, and I guess in the Midwest, some of the states as a whole are working towards those kinds of cooperative arrangements.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.836
Do you allow undergraduates in here?

14:35.856 --> 14:36.437
Absolutely.

14:36.788 --> 14:42.776
Our rules are very simple.

14:43.257 --> 14:48.103
You have to be over the age of 18 to use the University of California libraries, period.

14:48.143 --> 14:59.438
And this is so that we don't have every one of the 150,000 high school seniors in here writing their term papers, you know.

14:59.654 --> 15:05.101
specifically to answer your question about special collections, we encourage the use of undergraduates.

15:05.161 --> 15:06.903
I've actually taught courses here.

15:06.943 --> 15:18.897
I taught a course in the history department called Research with Primary Resources, California History Without Textbooks, and it was geared to undergraduates.

15:18.917 --> 15:19.718
All right.

15:19.738 --> 15:21.460
I have a

15:22.317 --> 15:29.647
sort of a Catholic Church approach to this, give me an undergraduate before he graduates and he's mine for life, you know, that sort of thing.

15:30.007 --> 15:49.793
When it comes to showing them how to use rare books, how to use manuscripts, that they don't have to regurgitate textbooks, that they can go in-depth, even as an undergraduate, with a term paper and, you know, look at original documents about

15:50.178 --> 16:00.314
the establishment of California as a state in 1850, and what that entailed, taking over from Mexico, in effect.

16:00.414 --> 16:10.010
And we have documentation here that they can look at and examine and figure out, well, and then maybe go to the textbooks and say, now, is this just glossed over?

16:10.070 --> 16:17.822
Usually it's accurate, but how much am I really seeing when it says...

16:22.190 --> 16:31.239
I'm blanking out on the name right now, but somebody, you know, marches in and takes over Monterey, for example.

16:34.382 --> 16:40.889
By the same token, what was it, Sheldon said, you know, history repeats itself, but historians repeat one another.

16:41.569 --> 16:48.096
And, you know, maybe a kid might find something that maybe wasn't available to that historian, too, right?

16:48.481 --> 16:51.506
And do you find that you get pretty interesting papers out of these?

16:51.606 --> 16:52.307
Absolutely.

16:52.708 --> 16:59.058
I have a person who now works for me who was in one of those classes several years ago.

16:59.078 --> 17:06.269
There is a pageant that goes on here every year called the Ramona Pageant.

17:06.369 --> 17:07.671
I don't know if you've heard of that.

17:08.512 --> 17:11.897
And it happens out in the desert in a town called Hemet.

17:11.937 --> 17:18.788
But it's based on a myth about a woman named Ramona who married an Indian and, of course, was an outcast and so forth.

17:18.808 --> 17:23.074
And this pageant depicts the myth.

17:23.094 --> 17:27.080
I mean, there were movies made at this as well in the 30s and 40s.

17:27.461 --> 17:30.866
I think Dolores Del Rio was in one of the movies.

17:30.966 --> 17:36.274
But this staff member of mine wrote a very...

17:37.030 --> 17:53.312
detailed paper about the actuality of the myth, you know, what was really behind it, examined, I think, about 60 different editions of Ramona that had come out, you know, and then looked at the pageant and so forth.

17:54.273 --> 18:05.468
And a lot of that research was then used in one of our local public television series called Los Angeles History Project, and it was a whole

18:05.718 --> 18:08.822
segment devoted to the Ramona myth.

18:08.842 --> 18:11.866
That's a pretty good scholarship, isn't it?

18:11.986 --> 18:21.438
Yeah, and a lot of what this woman did, you know, was used and given credit for in the KCET production of that.

18:21.458 --> 18:25.003
So they can take it as far as they want.

18:25.143 --> 18:29.849
You know, of course, that so many research facilities don't allow undergraduates.

18:30.129 --> 18:32.873
I mean, you have to go in and really demonstrate

18:33.967 --> 18:35.608
the worthiness of your research.

18:35.628 --> 18:35.949
Right.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.090
And we do interview.

18:37.170 --> 18:47.239
I mean, if a kid comes in and says, I want to see your first edition of The Whale, you know, from the novel, okay, well, why do you want to do that?

18:47.259 --> 18:49.121
He says, I've got to read it for class tomorrow.

18:51.082 --> 18:58.349
We say, well, gee, why don't we see if there's a circulated copy in College Library, you know, and we can find that very quickly.

18:58.469 --> 19:03.113
Or, why don't you go to the bookstore and buy the Riverside edition or whatever.

19:03.616 --> 19:12.764
But if an undergraduate comes in and we've tried to work, especially, this library is focused in humanities and social sciences.

19:12.784 --> 19:17.768
There are other special collections on campus I can tell you about later on.

19:17.868 --> 19:32.661
But if they come in and they've got a specific project and they say, you know, I've got this topic, I'd really like to look at something, some primary resource about it, we're delighted.

19:32.793 --> 19:33.914
I look upon it.

19:33.935 --> 19:35.196
We're a state institution.

19:36.618 --> 19:44.909
There's a certain amount of justification that has to be made for the existence of a special collections library, especially in hard financial times.

19:44.929 --> 19:49.755
We're always the one that's looked at first and said, you know, do you really need this?

19:49.775 --> 19:51.057
And I can say, yes, we do.

19:51.117 --> 19:52.098
Look at our readership.

19:52.960 --> 19:58.267
You know, we've got 100, 150 readers a week in here.

19:59.308 --> 19:59.408
And

19:59.776 --> 20:01.098
There are visiting scholars.

20:01.118 --> 20:17.060
There's a woman from Columbia sitting in there right now looking at medieval Armenian manuscripts, and there could be an undergraduate sitting next to her looking at a copy of the whale, and he or she needs the bibliographic comparison.

20:18.823 --> 20:23.609
Larry Fowler has been described as a great collector, an institutional collector.

20:24.711 --> 20:27.775
Do you attribute a lot of the success of the collections to his

20:28.109 --> 20:31.194
Absolutely.

20:31.294 --> 20:34.379
And he established a pattern here.

20:35.100 --> 20:48.600
I mean, he had to go, he said, you know, yes, we have to buy the individual book, but I have to look at UCLA as a research institute and a place where scholars will come.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.565
And he actually tried to collect on a library level.

20:51.745 --> 20:56.412
And, you know, there are numerous collections that came in here that were

20:56.712 --> 20:57.974
wholesale libraries.

20:58.254 --> 21:03.600
I'll show you the Michael Sadler collection, 19th century fiction, for example.

21:03.661 --> 21:08.527
That's one of the great collections, and that was bought on block.

21:09.328 --> 21:13.352
We have one of the greatest Spinoza collections in the world here.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.834
That was bought on block.

21:14.854 --> 21:17.257
It was the library of Abraham Wolfe.

21:19.941 --> 21:25.167
We have a children's book collection that's made up of about five or six different collections that were bought

21:25.771 --> 21:29.817
in the late 40s and 50s and into the early 60s.

21:34.224 --> 21:44.080
The Cowan collection, which was the first Californiana collection that we had, and I mentioned earlier that Powell's first job was to catalog, was bought en bloc and so forth.

21:44.441 --> 21:45.502
And it just goes on and on.

21:45.522 --> 21:52.133
The woman who's looking at the medieval Armenian manuscripts is looking at

21:52.788 --> 21:58.415
the Armenian part of the Karo Manassian collection that was bought from Dr. Manassian.

22:00.358 --> 22:01.439
What was the date of this?

22:01.459 --> 22:05.204
67 or 68.

22:06.746 --> 22:11.893
And it was a whole library.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.996
We bought a whole bookstore in Jerusalem.

22:14.436 --> 22:19.783
We bought out a whole bookstore in Jerusalem to form the basis of our Judaic and Debraeva collection.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.727
You say that really the major acquisitions

22:23.332 --> 22:26.615
have been in the last 30 years or so?

22:27.616 --> 22:28.417
Not really.

22:28.457 --> 22:33.941
The major acquisitions have been since Powell's time, from the mid-30s to the present.

22:34.502 --> 22:52.478
What I meant was that since Murphy's time, the whole UCLA campus has come up on par, let's say, with Berkeley, and we're looking at facilities and quality of the faculty and number of students and

22:52.812 --> 22:55.756
when you get to the library, a comparable library budget.

22:57.438 --> 23:04.909
UCLA is consistently ranked second or third among the Association of Research Libraries, Harvard being number one.

23:05.870 --> 23:10.196
And we're constantly trading places back and forth with Berkeley.

23:10.256 --> 23:14.922
But UCLA, Berkeley are either two or three.

23:15.623 --> 23:21.351
And I'm talking about all the other major institutions, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, you name it.

23:21.753 --> 23:28.622
Only Harvard surpasses these two libraries, and we'd like to say they had a 300-year head start.

23:33.407 --> 23:40.116
Would you say that you experienced the same kind of explosive growth, say, that Texas did?

23:42.439 --> 23:42.999
Of course, they're there.

23:43.059 --> 23:47.625
Their situation is pretty interesting, as you know.

23:47.960 --> 23:54.507
Would you say a comparable kind of program, a quote, when Reformation took place here?

23:55.808 --> 23:56.749
Not exactly.

23:57.410 --> 24:01.674
I think Harry Ransom was really the moving force there.

24:02.675 --> 24:07.980
And you could really focus almost all of it on his efforts.

24:08.020 --> 24:12.865
They decided they were going to collect 20th century literature, and boy did they do it.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.688
And their book collections are...

24:16.141 --> 24:18.885
twice or two and a half times the size of ours.

24:19.285 --> 24:20.988
But we have more manuscripts now.

24:21.248 --> 24:28.578
I mean, I think this is where it gets very hard to compare because, you know, it can't just be a numbers game.

24:28.598 --> 24:31.863
I'm not checking in terms of the holdings either.

24:31.903 --> 24:37.090
I'm talking about the mandate and the kind of backing you get from the state and the money they spent.

24:37.150 --> 24:39.994
I mean, down there it was kind of, if you want it, we'll get it.

24:40.815 --> 24:42.597
And we'll figure out how to pay for it later.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.101
All right.

24:45.121 --> 24:45.962
In that case,

24:46.178 --> 24:59.194
Since Franklin Murphy's time, yes, it's been like Texas, because virtually everything that the library went to Franklin over, he got for them.

24:59.435 --> 25:06.283
And it wasn't, but I guess the difference is it's not a case of go ahead and get it, we'll figure out how to pay for it later.

25:07.225 --> 25:14.734
Powell and Vosper would go to him and say, you know, gee, here's the Manassian collection, and it will really establish health

25:15.490 --> 25:22.117
form a foundation for our Center for Near Eastern Studies, and he said, fine, I'll get you the money, and he did.

25:22.797 --> 25:27.562
I mean, it wasn't a case of, you know, saying, well, we'll figure it out.

25:28.043 --> 25:30.605
He got the money, you know.

25:31.466 --> 25:41.076
We just had a reception this past Sunday because one of our Near Eastern professors just published a book about

25:41.917 --> 25:50.947
the cornerstone manuscript in the collection, which is a gospel that was done in Glazor, Armenia, around 1300.

25:51.087 --> 26:00.819
And this is a scholarly work about it, but with complete plates of all illuminations and that sort of thing.

26:01.820 --> 26:09.088
And Murphy was here, and Professor Sanjan, who published the book,

26:09.490 --> 26:17.544
told the story of getting him an Austrian collection, and he said he'd gone, he and Bob Bosford had gone to Franklin Murphy and said, there's this opportunity.

26:18.345 --> 26:25.919
And Murphy says, well, it just so happens I happen to be having lunch with one of the leaders of the Armenian community today.

26:26.039 --> 26:27.381
Why don't you come join us?

26:28.062 --> 26:28.483
You know?

26:29.344 --> 26:30.807
And as

26:31.073 --> 26:34.797
Professor Sanjian said, I remember distinctly what the lunch was.

26:34.877 --> 26:37.641
It was cold cuts, and it cost Mr. Mnougian $25,000.

26:37.761 --> 26:41.445
M-A-N-O-O-G-I-A-N is that?

26:42.026 --> 26:47.372
Let me, if you could, you want to stop this for a second?

26:47.672 --> 26:49.194
Let me get the book.

26:49.214 --> 26:53.259
This is the book which just got published.

26:55.001 --> 26:56.603
Good boy, who published that?

26:56.623 --> 26:57.604
Dumbarton Notes.

26:57.854 --> 27:02.419
We offered to the University of California first, and I wish you had.

27:02.439 --> 27:05.262
I get the U-C-A-L.

27:05.783 --> 27:06.323
Let's see.

27:07.805 --> 27:08.906
Here's Manuvian's name.

27:09.166 --> 27:13.791
Alex Manuvian, A-L-E-X, M-A-N-O-O-G-A-N.

27:14.071 --> 27:15.873
This is in print now from Dumbarton Works?

27:15.934 --> 27:20.959
Yeah.

27:20.979 --> 27:25.684
Okay, Tony, why don't you... One school?

27:26.103 --> 27:28.705
Mr. Manugian's gift was the beginning of it.

27:29.186 --> 27:31.989
I don't remember what the total cost of the collection was.

27:32.069 --> 27:35.912
I think it was maybe $200,000 at that point.

27:37.954 --> 27:52.688
But I think the point I'm trying to make is, Sanjan and Vosfer go to see Murphy at 10 o'clock in the morning, and he just happens to be having lunch with Manugian that day.

27:52.708 --> 27:55.671
He says, come along, and the whole thing is put into

27:57.068 --> 27:58.709
into process right away.

27:58.770 --> 28:03.614
This is the legacy of Franklin Murphy.

28:03.694 --> 28:07.698
I mean, he is a doer, and he still does for us.

28:08.198 --> 28:14.063
And isn't it wonderful if you had a man of Armenian descent or Armenian, American or Armenian, is that right?

28:14.404 --> 28:16.846
Mr. Mnubi, I believe so, yes.

28:16.866 --> 28:19.108
Well, he was doing something for his heritage, too.

28:19.769 --> 28:26.755
Now, while he's not a collector, because again, this is a focus in my book on collecting, here is a man that's contributing to a collection.

28:26.937 --> 28:39.434
That's also one of the great attributes, I think, of Franklin Murphy, that he is able to put people together.

28:41.437 --> 28:45.683
We can talk about our Italian printing collection.

28:45.723 --> 28:56.117
We started that 30 years ago, 1961, and there was an opportunity to buy 45 Aldi's.

28:57.599 --> 29:02.546
from John Howell books in San Francisco.

29:02.566 --> 29:07.033
And my predecessors went to Franklin and said, here's this opportunity.

29:08.455 --> 29:16.106
They needed $13,000 to buy these 45 books, which is unbelievable.

29:16.146 --> 29:17.067
But they didn't have it.

29:17.448 --> 29:19.070
And he said, fine, go buy it.

29:19.611 --> 29:20.953
And the money was there.

29:20.973 --> 29:22.375
And that's what started.

29:22.996 --> 29:25.820
We have over 750 Aldeans today.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.602
How many is that over 750?

29:27.622 --> 29:31.347
That's pretty spectacular.

29:32.569 --> 29:33.991
I was offered one for one.

29:34.251 --> 29:36.654
I served a similar money and I passed on it.

29:36.674 --> 29:39.699
I haven't collected Aldeans.

29:39.779 --> 29:42.402
How was that for Clark?

29:42.442 --> 29:43.023
$50.

29:43.404 --> 29:46.768
I can give you an order sheet.

29:46.788 --> 29:49.712
I would love to have it.

29:50.671 --> 29:57.182
And this was a collection that was developed here, too, wasn't developed by an individual collector.

29:58.104 --> 29:59.606
I would say, is that correct?

29:59.626 --> 30:01.149
You didn't buy one collection here.

30:01.289 --> 30:13.811
Well, the Manassian collection formed the basis of the medieval Renaissance Middle Eastern manuscripts.

30:13.991 --> 30:16.155
It's not just Armenian manuscripts.

30:17.671 --> 30:45.062
uh 14th to 18th century we have about 15 000 middle eastern manuscripts and the core of them came from the manassian collection um and this gladzer gospel is um again one of 92 armenian manuscripts in that collusion and and it's it's it's an incredible and it should be noted too though we're from

30:45.464 --> 30:49.689
the Worcester, Massachusetts area, which has a considerable Armenian community.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.493
I think the largest is out here, isn't it?

30:52.513 --> 30:58.241
So this has functioned for scholars in this area, I would think.

30:58.361 --> 31:00.343
It's not just having a great Armenian collection.

31:00.904 --> 31:04.088
No, it supports the community.

31:04.228 --> 31:07.813
And now we get back to the issue of who can use the library.

31:07.853 --> 31:09.355
It's a public institution.

31:10.296 --> 31:13.260
And I think we've established a pretty good rapport

31:13.612 --> 31:20.159
with the community, various aspects of the community, and we want them to have access to these resources.

31:20.200 --> 31:24.565
This is a place worth of Huntington and the Getty, too, but this is the place for it.

31:25.145 --> 31:32.073
To go back to, as you said, you would go to Murphy and say, we want this, and Murphy would say, fine, I will get the money.

31:32.814 --> 31:36.138
In contrast, Texas bought on time, you know, in some cases.

31:36.218 --> 31:41.644
It's the only state of state I've ever seen where actually they bought stuff, and

31:41.843 --> 31:45.990
terms were worked out where they would pay for two or three or four years?

31:46.010 --> 31:47.332
Oh, we've done that, too.

31:47.452 --> 31:47.632
Have you?

31:47.813 --> 31:48.173
Oh, yeah.

31:48.193 --> 31:50.016
I mean, we did it with Manassian.

31:50.036 --> 31:59.892
I mean, Manoogian put up, you know, the first pledge towards us, which was about 10%, you know, but the same day he got, you know, an initial response.

32:01.014 --> 32:06.062
And that's really a funny story, too, because...

32:08.438 --> 32:17.127
I don't know what the final balance of the payment to Dr. Manassian was, but I know where the funds came from.

32:17.147 --> 32:27.698
They came from the athletic department, who made a profit one year, and Dr. Murphy said, okay, we'll pay off the Manassian collection from the Rose Bowl or something like that.

32:27.718 --> 32:28.158
I don't know.

32:28.719 --> 32:30.621
That's a case.

32:30.741 --> 32:33.904
That's kind of exquisite, isn't it?

32:33.924 --> 32:37.568
We were just looking at the illuminated names for someone at Big Daddy the other day.

32:37.970 --> 32:45.160
Yeah, now that is the premier collection in the community.

32:45.942 --> 32:53.032
And, you know, we wouldn't be going after something like this today because this gets back to what I was saying before about the cooperation.

32:53.813 --> 33:04.408
If this were put forward to us today, we would say, well, gee, the Getty is really the one who's collecting this sort of thing.

33:05.330 --> 33:05.530
All right?

33:06.134 --> 33:13.466
I can show you the original.

33:13.727 --> 33:19.416
Let's talk a bit about the private collector.

33:20.378 --> 33:24.464
And you said that this is something of an interesting noise, too.

33:24.545 --> 33:27.590
Didn't you say that in the form that you are interested in collectors?

33:28.371 --> 33:31.416
Maybe you could talk a little bit about

33:32.189 --> 33:41.883
Do you owe anything, not necessarily in terms of monetary help, but what does a research library like this owe to private collectors?

33:42.104 --> 33:42.504
A lot.

33:44.968 --> 33:52.539
Not so much the rest of the general library, but certainly the special collectives on campus rely heavily on private gifts.

33:56.244 --> 34:00.070
We have an allocation from the state

34:00.370 --> 34:04.337
budget that comes to us through the Head of Collection Development.

34:04.797 --> 34:06.099
And it's not a lot of money.

34:07.081 --> 34:09.525
I mean, we're a public institution.

34:09.585 --> 34:10.827
I can tell you these figures.

34:10.867 --> 34:13.331
You can find them out, you know, in public ledgers.

34:13.391 --> 34:26.212
So the allocation to this department is about, it ranges from $70,000 to $90,000 a year, which is not a lot of money for special collections.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.154
So we spend

34:27.742 --> 34:33.951
a good deal of it on our reference resources for the department, on our serial subscriptions for the department.

34:35.493 --> 34:45.648
And we put some of it into our Californiana collection, our children's books, and our 19th century fiction to continue satellite.

34:47.351 --> 34:50.395
Everything else we spend comes from private resources.

34:51.256 --> 34:57.225
And the Italian printing collection is entirely from private resources.

34:57.492 --> 35:08.508
I got a check in the mail yesterday from an estate supporting a collection of children's books.

35:08.528 --> 35:17.461
We have the paper of Holland Clancy Holland, the papers of Holland Clancy Holland who was a children's book writer and illustrator.

35:17.481 --> 35:22.969
He wrote books like Paddle to the Sea and Men at the Mississippi and so forth.

35:22.989 --> 35:26.554
We have all of his original papers and Mrs. Holland died

35:27.091 --> 35:43.414
six or eight months ago, and we had worked with her for years, and she made it a codicil of her will that a certain proportion of her estate would come to this department to support the collection.

35:44.255 --> 35:53.769
And by that, in this case, it means I don't think there's anything more to acquire, but we're going to process it, we're going to put together a traveling exhibition of it, and so forth.

35:53.789 --> 35:56.052
So that's the kind of resource that we get.

35:56.352 --> 36:04.526
And then we get people who just give us collections, we have people who give us money to add to collections like the Italian.

36:04.606 --> 36:08.572
$60,000, $70,000, that's not a lot of money at all.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.317
And that's all you get in your budget?

36:11.337 --> 36:12.078
From the state.

36:12.219 --> 36:16.065
From the state, but that's all you get in your budget from the state for acquisitions?

36:16.568 --> 36:17.750
From the state.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.093
I understand that.

36:19.173 --> 36:22.759
It represents about 15% of what we spend.

36:22.839 --> 36:25.664
The other 85% coming from private parts.

36:25.744 --> 36:30.753
But you couldn't put together special collections then without the benefactors out there.

36:30.894 --> 36:32.697
No, absolutely not.

36:33.218 --> 36:40.551
And conversely, there is the issue of how much state money would you spend on a department like special collections.

36:43.265 --> 36:45.808
staff to keep hours open and so forth.

36:45.828 --> 36:57.702
So I think there's a political issue involved in not wanting to spend much state money and therefore having to rely on private benefaction to build a special collection side of the library.

36:57.762 --> 37:00.125
And that's livable to me.

37:00.525 --> 37:02.928
Has that always been the case here, by the way?

37:02.948 --> 37:03.209
Absolutely.

37:03.409 --> 37:09.296
So your extraordinary collections are due largely to the beneficence of... Absolutely.

37:09.896 --> 37:12.379
To Alex Mnudian and people like him.

37:12.800 --> 37:12.900
Yeah.

37:13.049 --> 37:13.850
That's nice.

37:13.870 --> 37:22.682
Yeah, but I think it's a little bit more complicated for a state institution as opposed to a private institution.

37:22.702 --> 37:26.286
A private institution has its own Board of Regents.

37:26.306 --> 37:35.158
It looks at its resources and says, okay, we're going to give this much money to the library, and we will help the library so far in fundraising.

37:35.859 --> 37:42.988
A state institution says, you have a library budget based on enrollment, essentially.

37:43.627 --> 37:55.159
And that's the way it works in California, based on your enrollment and number of graduates and undergraduates and size of faculty and so forth.

37:55.820 --> 38:10.396
And it makes it very difficult to justify spending $15,000 or $20,000 on a 15th century book when you could get I don't know how many thousand serial subscriptions for that that would support a wide variety of things.

38:10.476 --> 38:12.418
So we don't want to spend state money.

38:13.242 --> 38:16.147
on this department except for operations.

38:16.488 --> 38:19.032
That's the one thing that I think ought to be fond of.

38:19.052 --> 38:20.295
You clarified something for me.

38:20.315 --> 38:26.165
Going back, you said, if you go to Dr. Murphy and you say, this is something we want, I'll get the money to get it.

38:26.205 --> 38:27.267
What were you talking about there?

38:27.347 --> 38:31.334
Were you talking about, they'll get the money to acquire a special collection?

38:31.354 --> 38:31.955
Yeah.

38:31.976 --> 38:36.083
But he will go out into the community and write and contact his sources.

38:36.403 --> 38:37.866
Yes, exactly.

38:38.977 --> 38:40.940
in the Los Angeles area?

38:40.960 --> 38:42.563
And beyond, sometimes.

38:42.723 --> 39:01.093
I mean, there were times, I don't have a specific example for you, but I know that there were times, as he was trying to bring UCLA up to par, when he would go to the regents and ask the regents or the president of the university to speak to the legislature about augmenting the library budget.

39:01.113 --> 39:05.760
But once again, I think there he was looking at basic operations.

39:08.845 --> 39:14.191
And to give, well, this isn't really relevant.

39:14.211 --> 39:23.762
I was going to talk about the number of cereals that the library gets, but it's irrelevant, really, to overturn down and take that from if you want.

39:23.782 --> 39:33.392
Do you find that the Los Angeles community, the Beverly Hills community, is very supportive in general of your needs?

39:34.173 --> 39:35.234
To a certain extent.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.637
I mean, we have a very...

39:38.714 --> 39:41.498
complicated development program on campus.

39:42.460 --> 39:54.758
And I cannot go out unilaterally and go talk to Magic Johnson or somebody like that and say, or Corrine, let's say, who is an alumnus, and say, Corrine, how about the library?

39:54.818 --> 40:00.066
Because the development office has already decided what Corrine is going to do for UCLA.

40:00.627 --> 40:05.334
But we do identify people who are interested in library events.

40:05.494 --> 40:08.198
I mean, we have strong friends of the library group.

40:09.005 --> 40:14.030
And then it's up to the development office to cultivate them.

40:14.050 --> 40:20.075
And then we have people like Franklin Murphy, Chancellor Emeritus, who is in the community, too.

40:20.816 --> 40:22.577
And it all kind of works.

40:23.038 --> 40:23.618
Networking.

40:23.858 --> 40:24.139
Yes.

40:24.919 --> 40:26.120
That's the buzzword.

40:26.681 --> 40:27.221
Networking.

40:28.082 --> 40:29.323
It all kind of works.

40:29.824 --> 40:33.547
Let's talk about collections as collections.

40:33.607 --> 40:39.012
How much do you think in terms of so many

40:39.262 --> 40:52.202
Great collections wouldn't exist if it weren't for the idiosyncrasies of the obsession of a person who might be fascinated by, you know, 17th century New England witchcraft.

40:53.384 --> 40:59.433
Cornell has this great witchcraft collection, and that's because somebody just had it and put it together.

40:59.794 --> 41:06.484
I don't think that anybody at Cornell would actually think, if you're thinking about developing collections, that go out and do this, but somebody did it.

41:06.886 --> 41:09.669
and the collector put it together, and then you have this resource.

41:09.689 --> 41:12.672
I mean, do you find this kind of situation?

41:13.593 --> 41:14.994
Every library has that.

41:15.114 --> 41:33.653
I would say it's not the way that UCLA has grown, because, again, historically, if you look at what Lawrence Clark Powell, Bob Bosker, Franklin Murphy, Russell Shank, one of our more recent university librarians, have been trying to accomplish,

41:34.443 --> 41:42.494
I think the real difference is we've always had a plan of what we wanted to accomplish, and that plan is focused on the academic programs.

41:42.995 --> 41:50.665
We establish a Center for Near Eastern Studies, and then we know we have to have library resources for it.

41:50.685 --> 42:03.623
So when our librarians are out looking for collections that support what's going on on campus, the Italian printing collection doesn't exist in a vacuum.

42:04.126 --> 42:19.630
We have several chaired positions in art history and history and so forth that make use of this collection.

42:19.650 --> 42:32.530
It's a collection that also has many first printed editions of classical works, and so the classics department makes use of it, and certainly the library school does from teaching the history of the book.

42:33.185 --> 42:46.647
So when I speak of some of the great collections that are here, and I say, for example, that we had an opportunity to buy 45 Aldeans in 1961, it wasn't buying Aldeans for the sake of buying Aldeans.

42:46.667 --> 42:52.436
It was buying Aldeans to support the research that's going on on this campus.

42:52.456 --> 42:55.621
Well, do you ever get any collections that don't?

42:56.142 --> 42:59.968
Is that kind of a role that every collection that you require?

43:00.691 --> 43:03.374
has to in some way support the curriculum?

43:04.015 --> 43:05.897
No, but it's the first thing that we look at.

43:05.937 --> 43:18.372
Nowadays, if someone offers us a collection, the first thing we say is, how does this fit into what we already have?

43:18.452 --> 43:20.474
How does it support what's going on here?

43:21.896 --> 43:25.720
Or a third question, is this breaking new ground that needs to be broken?

43:26.290 --> 43:34.119
That's another way of looking at it, of a collection that doesn't seem to quite fit in to what you're doing.

43:35.360 --> 43:47.594
But that's, again, a historical policy, written or unwritten, that that's the way this library has developed.

43:48.696 --> 43:54.222
And therefore, that's the attitude that we have when something is offered to us.

43:54.927 --> 43:59.312
I also have an unwritten rule of thumb nowadays because we have so much.

43:59.352 --> 44:14.228
If someone offers us a collection, let's say of books, because that's relatively easy to deal with as an example, and we have more than 50% of the books in that collection, I'm inclined to turn that collection down.

44:14.509 --> 44:16.571
But I don't just say, no, we're not interested.

44:16.611 --> 44:21.036
What I say is, we already have most of what you've got.

44:21.623 --> 44:31.516
Have you considered some of the smaller institutions in town like Occidental College or the Claremont Colleges who might better be able to make use of this?

44:31.536 --> 44:34.240
So it's not a singular thing.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.282
Oh, here's a collection on witchcraft.

44:36.363 --> 44:37.104
Do we want it?

44:38.545 --> 44:41.109
But here's a collection on witchcraft.

44:41.129 --> 44:43.412
Anybody teaching witchcraft on campus?

44:43.592 --> 44:47.277
I mean, you know, we don't just give an instantaneous answer.

44:48.134 --> 44:54.481
We go and find out what's going on, first and foremost, if it's out of our scope of knowledge.

44:54.622 --> 45:04.173
To go back to your example of the collector who may have a pretty nice collection of first editions or something or anything, and you may have 50% at war.

45:04.453 --> 45:08.798
As many institutions I can think of would take it anyway and probably sell them.

45:09.339 --> 45:10.720
We do that sometimes, too.

45:10.740 --> 45:13.163
I mean, I can't give you...

45:14.527 --> 45:22.196
A cut-and-dry policy and procedure, I have to look at everything, and my librarians have to look at everything on an individual basis.

45:22.376 --> 45:26.001
I mean, is this an area of activity?

45:26.041 --> 45:27.362
Do we want the other 50%?

45:28.804 --> 45:30.826
And then we would certainly take the duplicates.

45:31.147 --> 45:37.414
I mean, if it's something that's not an area of activity, that's the point at which we might refer them somewhere else.

45:37.494 --> 45:40.618
Is it something you think you might tell the prospective donor?

45:41.645 --> 45:52.550
You've got a 500 book or a 1,000 book collection, and there are 300 there that we'd really love to have, that we'd love to take it, but understand that we may sell out the others.

45:52.570 --> 45:53.773
Do you think that you'd tell them that?

45:54.735 --> 45:57.882
Again, if it looks like it's an appropriate thing to do.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.784
I mean, I wouldn't take it and not tell them that if that's what we were going through.

46:01.804 --> 46:05.409
Because a lot of people are really interested in keeping these things together as a unit, too.

46:05.889 --> 46:06.870
Exactly.

46:07.091 --> 46:11.796
And there are times when we will simply do that and duplicate the holdings.

46:11.856 --> 46:20.747
But what I'm saying is that I have to look at every collection in and of itself that is offered to us.

46:21.183 --> 46:23.846
and see is it being offered as a gift?

46:23.946 --> 46:25.407
What are the political connections?

46:25.467 --> 46:28.931
What are the research values to the collection?

46:29.231 --> 46:30.533
What do we already have of it?

46:31.514 --> 46:41.864
To answer your question, or to rephrase your collection, would the donor be willing for us to break the collection up?

46:42.225 --> 46:43.045
I've done that.

46:43.406 --> 46:46.549
I've done all of that.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.361
We just do it one way.

46:48.622 --> 46:54.187
We have to look at every single thing that comes in individually and say, and ask all of those questions.

46:54.207 --> 46:55.969
Let's go to another point that will help us.

46:57.211 --> 47:00.674
Let's say there's a collection you really want, really, really want.

47:00.894 --> 47:08.743
Warrior Swanson's collection, let's say, which went to Texas, and a lot of people thought they were going to get it.

47:08.763 --> 47:10.705
I don't know if it was USC or here, that was after it.

47:10.925 --> 47:12.166
BU certainly wanted it.

47:12.367 --> 47:13.708
It was SC, not us.

47:13.948 --> 47:14.929
SC, I think, yeah.

47:15.189 --> 47:16.671
But it wasn't there.

47:17.056 --> 47:23.041
And there were inducements, the Texas curator, maybe a room.

47:23.321 --> 47:24.522
Have you ever offered rooms?

47:26.024 --> 47:29.026
We went through Texas with a Knotch room.

47:29.187 --> 47:30.648
There must be a dozen rooms.

47:30.768 --> 47:32.049
I have no rooms to offer.

47:32.069 --> 47:33.771
Rooms coming out of their ears down there.

47:33.791 --> 47:35.592
Yeah, I have no rooms to offer.

47:35.912 --> 47:40.657
And a lot of times we get people who say, I want to give you this, but on condition.

47:41.677 --> 47:46.962
And we cannot promise what we cannot give.

47:47.600 --> 47:53.067
When you walk around here, in a few minutes you'll see that we are very pressed for space.

47:53.327 --> 47:59.635
I have no empty rooms waiting for names to be added to them or collections to be put into them.

48:00.656 --> 48:11.650
And we are talking about building an addition to this library, but we don't have the funding for it yet.

48:12.220 --> 48:14.882
When we do that, well, not some talk.

48:14.902 --> 48:19.826
We know that special collections will move into new quarters in that wing if and when we get that wing.

48:22.008 --> 48:27.913
But I'm not lining up people and setting up 20 separate rooms of collections.

48:27.973 --> 48:30.055
It's impossible to manage, number one.

48:30.075 --> 48:31.696
We don't have the staff to do that.

48:32.437 --> 48:38.742
And we come back to the issue of state institution and a budget that's driven by enrollments.

48:39.223 --> 48:42.025
That budget also means the number of staff that we can have.

48:42.899 --> 48:44.000
in the whole library.

48:44.040 --> 48:48.225
And I don't have positions waiting to be filled either.

48:48.946 --> 48:54.031
If anything, I need more staff, but that's not the way I would fill it.

48:54.152 --> 48:58.156
We cannot function that way.

48:59.177 --> 49:00.719
It can't happen.

49:02.841 --> 49:12.552
We are talking to a couple of donors whose collections are already here about the funding of that new building

49:13.223 --> 49:16.246
and are talking about rooms with them.

49:17.007 --> 49:24.595
But to answer the question about if somebody on the outside comes along and says, I want a room, I can't promise them that.

49:25.035 --> 49:29.901
It's not for me to give, it's for the development office to decide if they want to do that.

49:29.921 --> 49:39.311
But to go back to that example you just cited, these few individuals you are talking to, it's understood that they would probably pay for these rooms, right?

49:39.331 --> 49:41.593
And if they want the room... Right.

49:42.232 --> 49:49.259
I worked at another institution, George Washington University in Washington, before I came out here.

49:50.260 --> 49:59.088
And we used to say of the development officer, the head of development there, the vice president for development, that he had every inch of the campus priced.

50:00.229 --> 50:08.717
But there was a huge building program going on there, a revitalization of that whole west end of Washington, and a lot of new buildings going up.

50:08.897 --> 50:11.580
We don't have new buildings.

50:12.185 --> 50:26.900
We're playing musical chairs right now with departments, and not just the library, but other departments on campus, because our power library is to undergo seismic renovation, and everybody has to get out.

50:27.781 --> 50:40.774
And we are really scrambling just to find places to put existing programs, people, if this building, I don't know if you came in from the west side of the building, but there's construction on the west end.

50:40.957 --> 50:46.522
And that's a temporary building that's going up to house a library school, which has to get out of Powell Library.

50:47.002 --> 50:53.968
I mean, we're not in a position to, we have no space to offer anybody as an inducement to giving them, giving us their collection.

50:54.409 --> 51:10.963
What we do offer them is this, that we are, we have competent staff that will process and catalog the collection, that we have a high activity of use, and it's not a collection that's going to be accepted never to see the light of day again.

51:11.180 --> 51:23.317
If we think the collection is worthwhile, based on all the criteria I gave you before about to what use would it be put, who's teaching witchcraft, who's doing this or that, that's what we offer them.

51:24.639 --> 51:31.909
You know, if you want to place your collection somewhere, give it to us because I can guarantee you that it will be used.

51:32.810 --> 51:35.053
That's great.

51:35.073 --> 51:36.495
Yeah, yeah.

51:37.133 --> 51:43.743
Did you see Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first Indiana Jones movie at the end?

51:44.023 --> 51:55.380
At the last scene when the government has taken the Ark away from Indiana Jones and there's this clerk wheeling it into a warehouse that goes on endlessly full of crates.

51:55.601 --> 51:57.203
Do you remember that image at all?

51:58.926 --> 52:06.617
I don't want anybody to ever have that image that it's going to get, something is going to get buried here, lost forever, never

52:07.424 --> 52:09.807
to be used again.

52:09.827 --> 52:12.089
And that's what our attitude is.

52:12.109 --> 52:17.716
Do you allow photo duplication of your manuscript stuff?

52:18.917 --> 52:20.018
Manuscripts in particular?

52:20.559 --> 52:20.839
All right.

52:21.140 --> 52:23.222
I know the context of that.

52:23.282 --> 52:25.785
The simple answer is yes.

52:26.566 --> 52:36.537
The complicated answer is if there are no restrictions placed on the manuscripts by the donor or the literary executor of the manuscripts,

52:38.542 --> 52:51.719
and if the photo duplication does not do any physical harm to the item, and if the person is doing it only for private research purposes, not for publication.

52:51.739 --> 52:57.386
Well, what if it's a scholar who's doing research and then will be quoting from this document?

52:57.406 --> 52:58.968
Quoting from it is one thing.

52:59.028 --> 53:04.916
Reproducing it in facsimile or transliterating it is another matter.

53:04.936 --> 53:06.017
Okay, and it also...

53:06.183 --> 53:13.414
But as every institution, you'll require approval, permission to quote from writing.

53:13.875 --> 53:18.462
But, you know, of course, you do know the context I'm asking, I said, because it's policy in Texas.

53:18.502 --> 53:20.344
You can't do it.

53:20.405 --> 53:27.175
I mean, if you want... Michael Holroyd wants to finish his Shah biography and he wants to see these letters, he can't see them.

53:27.195 --> 53:28.957
He has to go to Austin to do it.

53:29.538 --> 53:33.304
He can't order Xeroxes from Texas

53:33.554 --> 53:36.457
You may have to spend four weeks down there going through the letters.

53:36.517 --> 53:36.958
That's right.

53:37.178 --> 53:38.299
And it's policy.

53:38.319 --> 53:44.946
In fact, even if there are copies, they insist, they say when they buy things that there better be no other copies of this.

53:45.086 --> 53:49.391
They want total title to the whole thing.

53:49.411 --> 53:50.592
What do you think of that policy?

53:52.794 --> 53:58.060
There are many days when I wish we had it because it would be so easy to administer, okay?

53:58.597 --> 53:59.579
you just say no.

53:59.819 --> 54:02.263
But it doesn't do much to serve scholarship.

54:02.403 --> 54:03.745
Exactly, exactly.

54:03.825 --> 54:09.754
So we're trying to work from the point of view of the criteria that I mentioned.

54:09.774 --> 54:12.839
I'll give you a copy of our photo duplication policy.

54:12.879 --> 54:18.748
That's a standard policy, by the way, which is perfectly understandable and makes sense.

54:18.888 --> 54:26.460
Yeah, and I think what they're reserving, especially if they've obtained literary rights to the material, is

54:26.744 --> 54:35.594
the possibility of their publishing it at some time and garnering some financial return on that.

54:36.355 --> 54:52.313
I guess what it comes down to is that I don't have a staff here that is going to fulfill that kind of promise, you know, where we will publish it rather than anybody else.

54:53.214 --> 54:54.996
We don't want to impede scholarship.

54:55.229 --> 54:57.692
We do want to protect literary rights.

54:58.673 --> 55:00.715
So here is a good example.

55:02.136 --> 55:05.860
It's not just a matter of whose papers they are, but what are in those papers.

55:06.721 --> 55:12.147
We have, I'm trying to think, I guess it's in our oldest Huxley collection.

55:13.768 --> 55:14.509
There are T.S.

55:14.529 --> 55:15.510
Eliot letters.

55:17.152 --> 55:25.000
There are certain restrictions on Huxley's material from Laura Huxley, and permission has to be obtained from her by readers.

55:25.655 --> 55:39.449
If a reader wants to quote or reproduce any of the Eliot material which are in the Huxley papers, they have to get permission from the Eliot estate.

55:39.469 --> 55:40.410
I mean, you know this.

55:41.051 --> 55:42.512
I mean, this is standard procedure.

55:42.873 --> 55:51.722
But it doesn't... We will... Our department functions this way rather than just saying, no, you can't have a copy.

55:52.282 --> 55:54.364
We'll serve as an intermediary to a scholar.

55:54.385 --> 55:54.885
We will write.

55:55.135 --> 56:07.607
to Mrs. Elliott and say, so-and-so is here, wants a copy of Mr. Elliott's letter to Mr. Huxley dated such-and-so, wouldn't give permission for a copy for private New Zealand.

56:07.627 --> 56:08.868
And she can say yes or no.

56:08.888 --> 56:12.131
But I mean, we're not just saying no categorically.

56:12.151 --> 56:18.897
And what I meant before when I said it, that would save us a lot of trouble and work if we were to do that.

56:18.937 --> 56:24.923
But I think this also goes along philosophically with what we're trying to do

56:25.848 --> 56:35.821
with use of the collections again, and we want to facilitate research, not impede it, not make Michael O'Royd, make a trip to L.A.

56:36.222 --> 56:37.824
And stay here for six weeks.

56:37.844 --> 56:40.708
Yeah, just for the purposes of access.

56:41.069 --> 56:43.572
Now, and that's where I'm trying to make the distinction.

56:44.333 --> 56:49.740
Access for us is free, quote-unquote.

56:49.760 --> 56:54.066
I mean, if he asks for microfilm of something, he will pay for the cost of the microfilms.

56:54.738 --> 56:56.260
But the access is free.

56:56.420 --> 56:58.943
It's the publication that isn't.

56:59.564 --> 57:02.387
Well, I purchased two oral histories from UCLA.

57:02.567 --> 57:02.988
Okay.

57:04.049 --> 57:06.452
I mean, we were able to do this over the phone and through the mail.

57:06.592 --> 57:07.012
Right.

57:07.253 --> 57:08.234
Exactly.

57:08.254 --> 57:10.557
I paid whatever I paid for the pages.

57:11.478 --> 57:12.158
That's understood.

57:12.219 --> 57:14.341
And a mailing charge, probably, and that's it.

57:14.441 --> 57:16.564
I mean, that's the way we function.

57:16.804 --> 57:17.725
Yeah, that's terrific.

57:18.295 --> 57:19.276
Maybe we shouldn't.

57:19.296 --> 57:19.937
Who knows?

57:20.317 --> 57:21.959
What's the point of it all?

57:22.520 --> 57:25.723
Then I come back to the issue of justifying why we exist.

57:27.085 --> 57:32.771
I think the main thing is we don't want to be this department perceived any differently from the rest of the library.

57:32.831 --> 57:35.354
We catalog our books using the same system.

57:35.975 --> 57:46.587
We provide the same kind of access to materials, although under a more restricted basis, but not access because, oh, you're only a kid.

57:46.647 --> 57:47.728
What do you need with this?

57:48.063 --> 57:51.788
or not access because whatever.

57:52.068 --> 57:57.675
You know, if you can't come here, you can't see it.

57:59.177 --> 58:00.238
We don't function that way.

58:01.560 --> 58:06.907
And like I said, there are many days when I'd like to function like Texas, so I'm not criticizing them either.

58:07.287 --> 58:07.948
Okay.

58:08.909 --> 58:09.550
What else?

58:09.670 --> 58:12.614
Do you have any questions for us?

58:12.634 --> 58:13.775
That's an excellent interview.

58:13.795 --> 58:15.077
I love it.

58:15.097 --> 58:15.738
I love it.

58:15.918 --> 58:16.399
That's good.

58:16.479 --> 58:17.580
I mean, everything was useful.

58:18.185 --> 58:20.337
Maybe you could... I'll walk you around.

58:20.780 --> 58:23.093
Did I send you brochures and things like that?

58:23.314 --> 58:25.004
You did, yeah.

58:25.084 --> 58:25.225
Okay.
