WEBVTT

00:03.524 --> 00:07.249
Donna?

00:07.890 --> 00:11.315
Yeah?

00:11.435 --> 00:12.497
Why don't you keep going?

00:13.618 --> 00:14.980
Oh, no.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.185
I came for two napkins.

00:18.205 --> 00:18.285
Huh?

00:18.305 --> 00:19.507
We can get back here.

00:26.316 --> 00:26.737
Oh, thanks.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.764
Were you both collectors when you did that?

00:31.824 --> 00:33.126
When you got married?

00:33.697 --> 00:37.742
This is something that developed, and the machine is on now, by the way.

00:38.543 --> 00:40.165
Were we collectors when we met?

00:40.605 --> 00:44.510
You have to understand.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.051
Well, you won't understand.

00:46.091 --> 00:48.214
We've known each other forever, by the way.

00:48.254 --> 00:50.256
Since we've been 15.

00:50.296 --> 00:51.217
We married at 22.

00:51.237 --> 00:51.738
I didn't know that.

00:52.038 --> 00:52.659
Yeah, yeah.

00:53.260 --> 00:55.302
When does that question totally move?

00:55.442 --> 01:01.189
I mean, we were not the whole... We fully developed as married people.

01:01.473 --> 01:03.034
We've been married almost 38 years.

01:03.094 --> 01:04.516
Do you finish each other's sentences?

01:05.076 --> 01:06.457
Do you have that only look-a-like?

01:07.338 --> 01:13.003
You know, my wife and I know it's scary sometimes how the thoughts are.

01:13.023 --> 01:15.685
They're thinking about the same exact things at the same moment.

01:15.806 --> 01:17.367
I mean, you've got to have that, right?

01:18.268 --> 01:21.270
Yeah, I mean, you can talk about a code that nobody else will understand.

01:21.330 --> 01:22.171
You don't realize it.

01:22.191 --> 01:23.192
Right, that's right.

01:23.552 --> 01:24.093
That's right.

01:24.113 --> 01:29.758
I can look at her face and know pretty much what she's most of the time.

01:29.778 --> 01:29.978
I don't.

01:31.055 --> 01:49.578
as with me, but I collect, as a child, I collected stamps, still have the stamp collection, and I tried to strive at that time, not having any money, I mean, just to have a very strong collection of certain countries.

01:50.860 --> 02:00.572
It just wasn't a desire, but I wasn't, I don't collect stamps today, but I think I collected, I collected little things, you know, rocks and

02:01.868 --> 02:08.415
I mean, you started early on, which is... I think Donna, you did too.

02:10.057 --> 02:17.205
But not, you know, just collecting as children collect.

02:17.365 --> 02:24.212
You said you started basically in your 40s, right?

02:24.312 --> 02:29.698
Yeah, but I read... I encouraged you to buy the first book that you read.

02:30.185 --> 02:32.687
encouraged him to do that a great deal.

02:32.707 --> 02:38.313
Yeah, I mean, I was always a heavy reader since I've been eight years old to five years old.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.135
So reading has always been a passion, but Donna's right.

02:41.756 --> 02:45.259
The first book was strictly Donna's.

02:45.279 --> 02:45.760
Encouraged me.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.581
I was very shy about buying it.

02:48.862 --> 02:50.504
It was a $10 book.

02:52.005 --> 02:59.112
And there was a letter in the book from Alfred Canoff to a newspaper editor, a book editor,

03:00.340 --> 03:05.046
talking about him, you know, Fitzgerald and all of that period.

03:05.106 --> 03:09.451
And the letter was written on the day I was born.

03:09.952 --> 03:12.335
And that was why he was finished.

03:12.355 --> 03:13.556
He had to have that book.

03:13.576 --> 03:14.357
Right, you know.

03:16.119 --> 03:17.401
I think he might have that book.

03:18.402 --> 03:23.308
But, you know, should he, should may, you know.

03:23.468 --> 03:28.795
Our place was so filled with all the contemporary readings, things we were reading day by day.

03:32.993 --> 03:36.918
wonderful bagels, may I say.

03:37.518 --> 03:37.698
Yes.

03:37.738 --> 03:38.399
Have another one.

03:38.620 --> 03:42.023
I should have asked you if you wanted to post it.

03:42.043 --> 03:43.045
This book is priceless.

03:46.348 --> 03:53.777
The Sea of Grass, Connery Richter.

03:56.220 --> 03:57.601
Pre-publication copy.

03:57.922 --> 03:59.844
$7 on it, by the way.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.427
$5.07.

04:03.875 --> 04:04.335
Here it is.

04:04.356 --> 04:06.838
This is one of 250 copies, signed by the author.

04:07.499 --> 04:11.083
It goes with his publisher's best wishes for Christmas in the New Year, 1937.

04:12.104 --> 04:16.929
Harry Mack, the other held in 1937.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.472
And you say this letter that accompanies it.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.100
Well, that's quite a letter from Alfred, isn't it?

04:30.142 --> 04:30.743
Two pages.

04:31.094 --> 04:34.959
December 12, 1936, which is your birth date, right?

04:36.762 --> 04:37.422
Right.

04:37.442 --> 04:37.843
Oh, Warren.

04:37.923 --> 04:38.964
That is your birth date.

04:39.245 --> 04:39.525
Yes.

04:41.067 --> 04:58.410
It seems to be a two-page, a full two-page typed letter signed by Alfred Knopf to Harry MacDill, A-M-C, capital I-L-L-E-A-I-N-E, Esquire Lawyer of the Cleveland News Company.

04:59.452 --> 05:00.493
So this is a local book.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.863
I mean, a local person that had it.

05:03.883 --> 05:05.945
Cleveland News is an old Cleveland newspaper.

05:07.727 --> 05:09.588
It was our other daily paper.

05:09.668 --> 05:10.689
We don't have it anymore.

05:12.691 --> 05:14.533
So that book to me is priceless.

05:15.935 --> 05:17.476
And you know that prices are relevant.

05:17.816 --> 05:18.337
Isn't that great?

05:19.698 --> 05:20.879
So that was the first one.

05:20.899 --> 05:23.002
So did you know you were a collector with that book?

05:23.282 --> 05:23.502
No.

05:23.722 --> 05:23.902
No.

05:24.443 --> 05:28.607
The thing that made you, the collector, was the next purchase, which was the yellow book.

05:29.768 --> 05:30.389
which I saw.

05:30.449 --> 05:31.851
Right.

05:33.112 --> 05:35.976
I brought one copy home, one of the editions home.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.458
It was expensive for me.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.725
I said to Don, I'm sure I didn't show it down.

05:42.745 --> 05:44.467
For a week, we said, that's a lot of money.

05:45.408 --> 05:48.512
How much, do you remember, what you're talking about?

05:49.314 --> 05:50.976
A hundred dollars, a hundred dollars.

05:50.996 --> 05:54.420
And this is about how many years ago, would you say?

05:56.162 --> 05:56.603
Eighteen.

05:58.507 --> 05:59.208
I'm sorry, what?

05:59.228 --> 05:59.829
18 years ago.

06:00.089 --> 06:03.974
18 years ago.

06:03.994 --> 06:04.074
19.

06:04.194 --> 06:07.518
So your law practice was proceeding well.

06:08.760 --> 06:14.267
This was something that you could certainly... You were a struggling young lawyer at that particular point.

06:14.347 --> 06:20.815
No, but it was just the idea of making this fateful move, right?

06:20.835 --> 06:21.056
Right.

06:23.279 --> 06:25.001
And we bought it down in the first year to buy it.

06:25.181 --> 06:25.742
The whole set?

06:26.202 --> 06:26.342
Mm-hmm.

06:26.663 --> 06:28.145
And how many volumes was that?

06:28.165 --> 06:28.345
13.

06:28.882 --> 06:30.404
And is that like the whole run?

06:30.744 --> 06:31.885
That's the whole run.

06:32.026 --> 06:34.008
It came out in monthly parts.

06:34.208 --> 06:34.929
Parts again.

06:34.949 --> 06:38.553
So you basically started as a collector with parts, didn't you?

06:38.573 --> 06:39.374
Well, kind of.

06:39.434 --> 06:40.775
Although that's a magazine.

06:41.156 --> 06:42.938
That's not really parts.

06:42.958 --> 06:45.120
But the next one after that was Little Dorit.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.283
But conceptually it's the same thing.

06:47.303 --> 06:54.251
And then Little Dorit came next, which just Peter Heisercloth started, which also started Hugo.

06:55.692 --> 06:56.273
And he had this

06:57.383 --> 07:08.433
And then he had a letter from Dickens to someone talking about how his daughter died, named Dora, and named the book after her.

07:08.453 --> 07:15.920
And that became, you know, I loved Dickens, and that went from that to other things.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.080
Yeah.

07:17.381 --> 07:18.182
Just some O'Neill.

07:18.983 --> 07:26.850
You know, just sort of a... And then we were up in Cape Cod, and we were at a friend's parents' home, and he had a...

07:27.623 --> 07:29.244
a number of books in Rockwell, Kent.

07:31.386 --> 07:44.037
And I started reading into Kent and realized he was the kind of person, not an attractive person, but traveled a lot and lived in different countries and was an explorer of sorts, and that's kind of what we do.

07:44.758 --> 07:48.941
And became fascinated with his history and his talents and started collecting Kent.

07:48.961 --> 07:51.724
And so everything has a connection.

07:51.844 --> 07:53.725
Well, everything has a connection.

07:53.745 --> 07:56.888
Would you say your shared passion for traveling,

07:57.155 --> 08:00.520
outlined briefly last night, which sounds extraordinary.

08:01.421 --> 08:03.244
Does this feed off every time?

08:03.344 --> 08:05.527
Does this energize the collecting at all?

08:05.708 --> 08:07.049
No, it's separate.

08:07.130 --> 08:07.751
It's just separate.

08:08.972 --> 08:09.894
I mean, I'm not a traveler.

08:09.954 --> 08:11.756
I don't collect travel books per se.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.001
I read a lot.

08:15.241 --> 08:17.965
We read a lot to travel and get ideas.

08:18.026 --> 08:24.495
I mean, we went to Afghanistan in 1980 when the Russians, while the Russians were coming in.

08:25.252 --> 08:38.190
And we went there simply because, as a child, I read about Marco Polo and the Silk Route and decided it would be a great trip, not knowing how dangerous it was at that point.

08:38.210 --> 08:42.456
And you read out of books, you develop fantasies or wish fulfillment.

08:43.017 --> 08:52.710
We've been very lucky over the decades to execute and come together with our fantasies.

08:52.994 --> 08:59.443
Do you find often, usually, that the actual experience fulfills the fantasy?

08:59.844 --> 09:01.166
I'm just a curious question.

09:01.186 --> 09:04.330
Good question.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.015
Yeah.

09:08.696 --> 09:08.917
Yes.

09:09.297 --> 09:14.164
We've been following the Silk Route for 20 years, for instance, off and on.

09:15.306 --> 09:21.955
And one day, you know, we went to Mazar-e-Sharif, which is the northern part of Afghanistan.

09:22.492 --> 09:25.095
I said to Donna, I would love to cross the river.

09:25.435 --> 09:31.120
Can we get up to Russia, which is where the steppes are, because the fantasy of the steppes and Tolstoy.

09:32.141 --> 09:34.183
And we tried to get up there.

09:34.203 --> 09:39.088
I want to wear my jeans and take a quick shower.

09:39.729 --> 09:44.994
And we tried to get up there, but we were, the Russians were starting to come in then.

09:45.094 --> 09:46.335
We had to get out of there.

09:47.577 --> 09:52.161
And so I said to Donna that I wanted to

09:53.542 --> 09:54.723
go back there.

09:54.743 --> 09:55.665
What's on the side of the river?

09:56.105 --> 09:57.006
Samarkand.

09:57.887 --> 09:58.448
S-A-M-A-R-K-A-M-D.

09:58.668 --> 10:02.313
Samarkand, okay.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.195
And Bukhara, or Bukhara.

10:04.736 --> 10:09.402
These are fabled cities from... So I said to Donna, we've got to get over there.

10:09.842 --> 10:21.777
And so a few years later, there was a trip to Central Russian Asia, and we took a trip to Samarkand, and Bukhara

10:22.229 --> 10:34.183
And although the cities aren't quite obviously the same as in fairy tales and in the history, I can say we were there and we lived on both sides of the river.

10:34.484 --> 10:35.705
It was a wonderful experience.

10:37.728 --> 10:50.683
A few years ago we went to Pakistan, traveled up to the Hunza River, and we were going up to China when we got trapped in upper Pakistan for ten days.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.339
I'll give you a... I mean, I'll show you.

10:54.799 --> 10:55.240
Okay.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.021
I just read a few notes here.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.273
This is an article I wrote.

11:08.357 --> 11:10.019
So you've done a little bit of writing, haven't you?

11:11.841 --> 11:12.142
Oh, yeah.

11:12.222 --> 11:15.206
This is called A False Paradise by Robert H. Jackson.

11:15.426 --> 11:16.888
And who did you write this for?

11:17.369 --> 11:17.809
Myself.

11:18.951 --> 11:20.533
So it exists in this forum?

11:20.633 --> 11:21.514
I haven't published it.

11:21.832 --> 11:23.073
Is this a copy?

11:23.093 --> 11:24.255
No, I can make a copy.

11:24.355 --> 11:24.735
Why not?

11:24.895 --> 11:26.698
I'd love to have a copy.

11:26.718 --> 11:30.001
You know, you can send it so you don't have to do it right now, sort of like that.

11:30.021 --> 11:34.206
But, you know, I wrote this, you know, it's a 5,000-word article.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.789
And I said to myself, and I've shown it to a few people.

11:37.310 --> 11:38.691
I like that.

11:38.711 --> 11:41.294
You know, I like everything that I can.

11:41.314 --> 11:42.976
Well, you know, I write.

11:43.296 --> 11:44.197
But I just, you know.

11:44.898 --> 11:46.940
And I have started another article in Yemen.

11:47.321 --> 11:49.223
See, this is where we had to be.

11:49.945 --> 11:54.171
They evacuated by helicopter and were pushing people off the helicopter.

11:54.251 --> 11:55.834
It's like Vietnam.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.316
It was a terrible experience.

11:58.057 --> 12:04.427
And then the road started in Arco on Yemen, being across an empty corridor with bodyguards.

12:04.467 --> 12:07.351
So we've had our, you know, we've been chased by police.

12:07.912 --> 12:10.015
So you kind of pushed the envelope a little bit.

12:10.035 --> 12:10.516
Oh, yeah.

12:10.536 --> 12:11.778
Did you get a kick out of that?

12:11.798 --> 12:12.559
A little adrenaline?

12:12.579 --> 12:13.180
A little bit.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.483
I mean, we've been... How about your life?

12:16.805 --> 12:17.927
Not as much, no.

12:18.498 --> 12:24.143
We've been in tribal wars in New Guinea, where we got shot out with bolts and arrows.

12:25.264 --> 12:27.386
You know, we had to fend off.

12:27.486 --> 12:30.929
You know, we had some... We've had... How long are these trips?

12:31.089 --> 12:32.410
What duration?

12:32.530 --> 12:32.970
Three weeks.

12:33.871 --> 12:40.537
And you do... So I gather it's your practice to do something like this, a major... Every year.

12:40.637 --> 12:41.097
Every year.

12:41.918 --> 12:43.740
About the same time each year?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.281
Yeah, September is always a good time.

12:45.821 --> 12:47.863
Usually weather, except in...

12:48.738 --> 12:50.561
Pakistan, the weather was superb.

12:52.143 --> 13:11.634
Last year we went to Bolivia and crossed the Alto Plano, the high desert, and we got lost on the Salt Lake, which is a flat in the south because the driver we had had never been there before, so I had to figure out a way to get out of there.

13:12.355 --> 13:16.922
And then we ran into, it's a great story, we ran into, we were in a little hut,

13:18.185 --> 13:20.589
on the edge of the Salt Sea.

13:21.170 --> 13:30.645
And we stayed there this night, and the people, the Indians who put us up, are being threatened by the neighbors because they're making money.

13:31.447 --> 13:44.648
And we ran across a French archaeologist who is stealing some of the treasures from Bolivia.

13:45.269 --> 13:47.012
He got caught, and now he's back again.

13:47.052 --> 13:48.935
We just happened to run into him that night.

13:49.136 --> 13:51.420
It was a little hot.

13:51.941 --> 13:56.829
You know, there's no electricity, no water, and we were able to, you know, have an experience with him.

13:56.849 --> 13:59.454
I have eight pages, ten pages of notes.

13:59.974 --> 14:01.437
I interviewed the drivers.

14:02.018 --> 14:02.719
I did everything.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.142
Probably knew what you were doing.

14:04.162 --> 14:06.946
I just had him go sit down and put it to him.

14:06.966 --> 14:07.668
It's a great story.

14:07.688 --> 14:08.489
It's a great little.

14:09.451 --> 14:10.432
You're right.

14:10.453 --> 14:10.753
You're right.

14:10.953 --> 14:13.295
Or even do it orally, you know, even talking into people.

14:13.315 --> 14:13.776
I know.

14:13.796 --> 14:15.157
It's a great story.

14:15.277 --> 14:24.927
I mean, it's not profound or anything, but it talks about the Indians and the French, how they... The context is that he's stealing, too, right?

14:25.027 --> 14:26.369
Yeah.

14:26.389 --> 14:27.910
Well, that's how they've raped.

14:27.970 --> 14:31.914
The French have raped more of South America than almost any other group.

14:31.934 --> 14:32.315
I know that.

14:33.055 --> 14:39.622
Well, and you know how the cultural... Well, the Spaniards have done a pretty good job.

14:39.642 --> 14:40.723
Well, I met him recently.

14:41.058 --> 14:49.207
and how the Indians are fighting with each other because they keep, they themselves are their own own cities because they don't allow free enterprise.

14:49.728 --> 14:53.392
They like to keep the people down.

14:55.274 --> 14:56.376
You know, things like that.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.196
Yeah.

14:57.216 --> 14:57.957
Well, it's interesting.

14:57.977 --> 15:08.770
So many of us read to travel, you know, I mean, to experience, and you certainly do that, but you do like to take it to the next speaker.

15:08.790 --> 15:09.851
Oh, I know.

15:09.871 --> 15:10.812
There aren't many people.

15:11.230 --> 15:22.341
We went to Tierra del Fuego some years ago to follow Rockwell Kent's footsteps, and I interviewed some of his people who thought knew him at that time.

15:22.361 --> 15:25.344
He's obviously been there a while.

15:25.364 --> 15:27.566
And I just enjoyed the weather.

15:28.167 --> 15:32.872
Is that a pattern, you say, to follow Rockwell Kent with the silk trade?

15:33.913 --> 15:39.398
It's a pattern of getting ideas from writers.

15:40.475 --> 15:43.099
In other words, it's just not... Let's pursue that a little bit.

15:43.279 --> 15:46.283
It's not just... How do you decide where you're going to go each year?

15:48.246 --> 15:52.472
Well, now it's more complicated than... You've been to most places that are interesting.

15:52.633 --> 16:00.043
So, one thing I haven't been to is Greenland, and I want to do a dark side ride across Greenland.

16:00.103 --> 16:00.364
Why?

16:00.384 --> 16:09.537
Because Rockwell Kent did it, and he gave me the idea, and it's Leif the Red, Leif Erickson, you know, just to... I read into history.

16:10.748 --> 16:15.053
I like to go down the Ebangi River where the Pygmies are to read about.

16:16.235 --> 16:17.176
Why would you want to do that?

16:17.576 --> 16:18.677
What gave you the idea for that?

16:19.538 --> 16:24.364
Reading a book by some Frenchman who spent time in the jungle with the Pygmies.

16:24.404 --> 16:27.328
Can you think of his name?

16:27.348 --> 16:29.230
No.

16:29.270 --> 16:29.911
He's Belgian.

16:30.692 --> 16:33.175
Well, let's think about it at some point.

16:33.275 --> 16:34.837
I have a vision of the book.

16:34.857 --> 16:35.678
I can tell you the book.

16:35.758 --> 16:40.283
It doesn't even matter, the title of it doesn't matter at this point, but it certainly fired you.

16:40.938 --> 16:44.883
Well, give me some other examples of this.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.466
Now, this is an interesting little angle here I like.

16:47.866 --> 16:57.778
Well, the evidence we found was Silk Road, and we read about Kashgar, which is the furthermost post in a city in China.

16:58.039 --> 17:00.101
And this was prior, of course, to going there.

17:00.121 --> 17:00.341
Oh, yeah.

17:00.361 --> 17:08.011
You read about Ariel Stein and some of the other great explorers, and Kashgar was the last outpost.

17:08.031 --> 17:08.531
I like this.

17:08.651 --> 17:09.052
I like this.

17:09.072 --> 17:10.333
This is a good angle.

17:10.353 --> 17:10.894
I like this.

17:11.161 --> 17:13.505
But this has nothing to do with collecting.

17:14.606 --> 17:21.156
Well, this book concerns itself with, as I said, matters beyond collecting.

17:21.376 --> 17:26.824
I'm really trying to explore how books make people play.

17:27.065 --> 17:27.706
See what I'm saying?

17:27.746 --> 17:29.929
We've been very lucky.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.176
You know, I read something.

17:32.236 --> 17:34.418
Now, this is not today and then go tomorrow.

17:34.578 --> 17:35.319
I mean, it just goes back.

17:35.339 --> 17:36.179
No, of course, but it's been.

17:36.239 --> 17:37.160
It's been 15 years.

17:37.921 --> 17:39.002
And it sits with me.

17:39.082 --> 17:41.063
Well, it becomes a fantasy, as you said earlier.

17:41.264 --> 17:43.325
And I actually... You fantasize it.

17:44.386 --> 17:44.687
Yeah, actually.

17:44.707 --> 17:45.427
I love the jungles.

17:46.268 --> 17:48.670
And so... Did you read Kipling?

17:48.690 --> 17:53.034
Yeah, and saw the movie with Sabu.

17:53.054 --> 17:56.356
And so what was the first thing I did when we were able to?

17:56.376 --> 17:59.179
We went to the jungles in Amazon.

17:59.539 --> 17:59.940
By ourselves.

17:59.980 --> 18:00.540
We all do...

18:01.567 --> 18:02.729
We did everything by ourselves.

18:04.011 --> 18:06.074
And we may hire God, but no groups.

18:06.475 --> 18:07.957
You may hire a guide, you said.

18:08.017 --> 18:09.139
Yeah, in that level of God.

18:10.220 --> 18:16.610
And we went up to jungles in Amazon to Leticia, where there's smugglers, and we went into the jungles with a guide.

18:17.431 --> 18:21.057
You know, and I just, you know, I could just envelop myself.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.519
It was fantasy.

18:22.539 --> 18:24.122
Tarzan movies, type of thing.

18:24.382 --> 18:28.088
And where did you stack this, during this, of your life?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.650
1970.

18:30.170 --> 18:34.394
So it's close to 30 years doing this.

18:34.434 --> 18:35.795
Now you have how many children?

18:35.815 --> 18:35.995
Two.

18:36.756 --> 18:41.040
And they're adults and they're away from home.

18:41.060 --> 18:44.683
Did you ever take them on any of these trips?

18:45.063 --> 18:55.172
We've taken them to... We climbed Mount Kinabalu in Borneo some years ago with my son and his friend.

18:55.252 --> 18:58.675
I couldn't climb all the way because of bad meat.

18:59.043 --> 19:04.810
Douglas I took to Pakistan, where we got trapped, and then I eventually took him to Tibet.

19:05.631 --> 19:17.285
And the kids I've taken to Israel and Egypt, we were there when they were turning over the Sinai to Egypt, and they saw the anger and the violence at the time.

19:17.685 --> 19:28.678
We've taken our daughter to Europe several times, and we've taken them around the country.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.422
place in the Bahamas we'd spend a lot of time in.

19:31.843 --> 19:32.984
Winter, of course.

19:33.064 --> 19:35.526
In about Montana.

19:36.047 --> 19:38.950
I think I'm camping a lot.

19:39.110 --> 19:49.760
That's a good little... I'm really willful in what I read or think about.

19:49.780 --> 19:58.969
The other part of it is to be accurate is to also talk to other travelers

20:00.063 --> 20:00.804
Go back on it.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.106
You're delighted by the Stanford acquisition of Ginsburg?

20:03.206 --> 20:03.787
Right.

20:03.947 --> 20:10.173
Because, you know, my sale to Arizona State was modest.

20:10.834 --> 20:22.146
The collection I have now is the major, I think it's most important, in private hands of the material, and it just gives credibility to it.

20:22.166 --> 20:28.112
Of course, the Whitney retrospective, I have a major lunch manuscript, and

20:28.852 --> 20:34.560
118 letters from Brinsburg to Burroughs at that time, Paul Bowles, Maturna.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.162
Things of that quality.

20:36.182 --> 20:38.926
I'll show you tonight if you want to try.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.748
I'm leaving about what time?

20:40.789 --> 20:41.029
10.30.

20:41.049 --> 20:42.972
We've got time there.

20:43.352 --> 20:43.893
I've got to go.

20:43.913 --> 20:45.034
Oh, you've got to go?

20:45.135 --> 20:45.916
I have to go to work.

20:46.136 --> 20:48.579
Oh, can I shoot a couple pictures before you go?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.522
There is a nice light.
