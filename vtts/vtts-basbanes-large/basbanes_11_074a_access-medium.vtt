00:02.731 --> 00:07.937
We're talking to Curtis Wong, is that correct?

00:08.497 --> 00:08.778
That's right.

00:08.798 --> 00:11.020
And your position, your title here?

00:11.661 --> 00:14.364
Oh, well, I see.

00:14.404 --> 00:18.228
My title these days is Director of Publishing Strategy.

00:18.849 --> 00:19.249
I see.

00:19.269 --> 00:23.034
So your job basically is to determine.

00:23.975 --> 00:28.840
I think about the long term of what this place does as a business.

00:29.292 --> 00:36.041
and how we create the things that we create, what we create, how it fits in the larger picture of where this company is going.

00:37.063 --> 00:39.806
Can you break that down a little bit for me?

00:40.007 --> 00:42.550
That's a strategic, I guess... That's a strategic thing.

00:42.911 --> 00:58.472
Thinking about, we've done a number of CD-ROM titles, why we pick what we pick, how those things are going to take us into the next realm of what electronic publishing might be like, how those things work with this large digital image archive that we're creating,

00:58.790 --> 01:00.052
why we have both of them.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.176
We can get into a discussion of that in a little while, and that's actually pretty interesting.

01:03.196 --> 01:10.327
Okay, well, I'd like to do that, and if it seems like I'm ignorant about these areas, just put me on track and talk about it.

01:10.848 --> 01:20.401
But you also, in general, determine the ways that these stories, if we want to call them that, these narratives.

01:20.422 --> 01:24.127
You have, I don't know how many images you have at your disposal.

01:24.147 --> 01:26.150
There must be millions of them now.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.632
We have, well,

01:28.085 --> 01:36.053
Along with the Bettman Arpacay, we have about 16 million images, of which about 700,000 are in digital form right now, and soon by the end of the year it will be about a million.

01:36.073 --> 01:37.995
So that's progressing.

01:38.135 --> 01:43.501
The area that I helped to get started here in this company deals with doing CD-ROMs.

01:43.541 --> 01:46.464
The first one I did was called The Passion for Art.

01:46.484 --> 01:48.226
I don't know if you've seen that.

01:48.486 --> 01:50.668
It's about the Barnes Foundation.

01:50.868 --> 01:51.929
Will I be able to get a copy of that?

01:51.949 --> 01:53.451
Sure, we'll get you copies of all of those.

01:53.718 --> 01:56.623
Let me also say, incidentally, you might be interested.

01:56.643 --> 01:58.005
I'm just pointing out something.

01:58.025 --> 01:58.125
Okay.

01:58.145 --> 02:01.410
It has nothing to do with my question.

02:01.431 --> 02:06.719
When I read in the New York Times, I guess it was February of the purchase of the Bettman Archive.

02:06.739 --> 02:07.020
Right.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.846
I read that Otto was alive and well and lucid and living in Florida.

02:10.866 --> 02:11.166
Florida.

02:11.186 --> 02:13.731
I went and did a two-day interview with him.

02:13.751 --> 02:13.931
Oh, good.

02:13.951 --> 02:15.654
And this new book will start.

02:16.134 --> 02:20.822
The prologue will be with Otto Bettman playing the organ, playing a violin.

02:21.916 --> 02:23.838
And I say to him, why Bach?

02:24.639 --> 02:26.121
And he said, I like Bach.

02:26.261 --> 02:30.005
Always returns to the same place that he started.

02:30.026 --> 02:41.619
You know, if you have two chapters called Continuum, and you really are talking about life beyond life, I just thought that, and plus he has lived and touched every decade of the 20th century.

02:41.639 --> 02:45.884
And plus he was a rare books librarian at Leipzig, and plus he was an emigre.

02:45.964 --> 02:50.910
I'm having a chapter in the emigre booksellers who were forced out by Hitler, all the survivors.

02:51.346 --> 03:02.717
how they totally influence the change of the flow of books, not the collectors, but the institutions, to the point that American collections are preeminent now in certain areas.

03:02.737 --> 03:03.818
I mean, they have to come here.

03:04.198 --> 03:06.781
The Europeans have to come here to see how they're all in history.

03:06.901 --> 03:08.923
Interesting, because of Hitler.

03:08.943 --> 03:16.350
Roger started at Harvard and said, it's amazing how much we owe to Hitler here at Harvard, and he says it without guile or irony, you know.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.872
Anyway, Otto touches so many different

03:19.375 --> 03:21.338
I'm sorry, but I thought you'd be interested.

03:21.358 --> 03:22.179
No, I am interested.

03:22.860 --> 03:23.261
Go ahead.

03:23.281 --> 03:24.683
I'm sorry, what you were about to say.

03:24.843 --> 03:28.568
You did say before we put on the tape recorder, I love books, I wouldn't give up.

03:28.588 --> 03:30.130
Why don't we just talk about that?

03:30.170 --> 03:30.471
Sure.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.133
My own love for books.

03:32.293 --> 03:33.956
Yeah, your own passion feeling or whatever.

03:33.976 --> 03:35.618
Well, I think it's interesting.

03:37.281 --> 03:41.046
One of the questions I always get asked when we're doing interactive is, well,

03:41.380 --> 03:44.343
Now that you're doing CD-ROMs, we don't need books anymore.

03:44.403 --> 03:46.946
We don't need to go to art museums anymore.

03:47.326 --> 03:50.369
I say, you know, that's not the case at all.

03:50.389 --> 03:52.511
I mean, I think that I love books.

03:52.771 --> 03:53.812
I would never give up books.

03:54.173 --> 03:57.316
It's really hard for me to get rid of a book, and that's one of my problems.

03:57.356 --> 03:59.678
I've got boxes and boxes of books.

04:00.099 --> 04:01.500
I also love movies, too.

04:02.041 --> 04:09.548
And to me, they're two very different things that both provide a way of telling stories and giving you information.

04:09.967 --> 04:26.465
And I think one of the problems with people doing interactive CD-ROMs early on is that they took material, repurposed material, from a book and, quote, turned it into a CD or tried to turn a movie into a CD, and that just didn't work.

04:27.707 --> 04:30.350
Because it's hard to beat a book.

04:30.790 --> 04:31.431
It's portable.

04:31.791 --> 04:35.856
It's much clearer resolution-wise, being able to look at the type and look at pictures.

04:36.157 --> 04:38.200
You don't need to buy a computer for it.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.521
You don't have to plug it in anywhere.

04:39.902 --> 04:41.083
It's cheap.

04:41.123 --> 04:42.004
You can go fast or slow.

04:42.024 --> 04:43.366
You can go anywhere you want in the book.

04:43.426 --> 04:44.087
That's right.

04:44.107 --> 04:45.008
It doesn't need batteries.

04:45.028 --> 04:45.649
It doesn't need batteries.

04:46.010 --> 04:46.751
I mean, it's great.

04:47.832 --> 04:52.037
The only problem is that there's some limitations with books.

04:53.519 --> 04:56.763
Some of that experience that you're trying to communicate.

04:56.823 --> 05:04.493
Now, I don't think that movies are better than books because whenever you go to a movie, you always say, you know, it wasn't as good as the book.

05:04.513 --> 05:05.995
You know, when have you ever heard

05:06.262 --> 05:08.204
You know, books say it wasn't as good as the movie.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.345
There are a few exceptions.

05:09.465 --> 05:10.006
Only a few.

05:11.147 --> 05:14.030
Gone with the Wind is probably a much better movie than it was a book.

05:14.050 --> 05:15.691
And maybe The Godfather, too.

05:16.913 --> 05:17.153
Yeah.

05:17.193 --> 05:17.954
But, you know.

05:18.554 --> 05:20.997
But most of the time... I can only think of two examples.

05:21.157 --> 05:22.298
Yeah.

05:22.318 --> 05:24.560
Most of the time, people feel that the book is better.

05:25.141 --> 05:29.786
Because it's hard to get the depth and richness that you can get in a book.

05:30.266 --> 05:31.788
That's right.

05:31.848 --> 05:33.049
But films... Can I just... Sure.

05:33.069 --> 05:36.252
Because one of the things that a movie does, and that a CD-run does,

05:36.670 --> 05:39.254
know that a CD-1 doesn't do.

05:39.274 --> 05:43.360
There is a linear approach to a good movie.

05:43.681 --> 05:43.921
Right.

05:44.141 --> 05:51.512
If you have a novel that has all this depth of character and all these different things, you're not necessarily working in that manner.

05:51.592 --> 05:58.202
You lose all of that in a 120-page... Right, because you have to condense it into two hours.

05:58.222 --> 06:04.011
I don't know if that's relevant to anything, but you do have to think in a linear way how to do things that you can't

06:04.261 --> 06:08.387
express in a linear way in a book, I guess, that you can't necessarily do.

06:08.407 --> 06:08.588
Right.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.551
So there's shortcomings in books.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.655
Shortcomings in films are like the brevity issue that you're talking about.

06:14.016 --> 06:20.105
But one of the things we love about movies is that movies really are, you know, the music and the dialogue and the images.

06:20.165 --> 06:22.008
It really kind of transports you somewhere.

06:22.068 --> 06:25.393
And sometimes better than the text in a book.

06:26.114 --> 06:33.205
And what we try and do with our CD-ROMs is, you know, in my thinking about what's wrong with Interactive, is to not try and replicate either of those.

06:33.421 --> 06:38.189
But you try and create an experience on CD-ROM that's the best of both and the worst of neither.

06:39.331 --> 06:44.199
So whenever we create our things, I always ask, you know, how is this better than a book?

06:44.219 --> 06:45.561
How is this better than a movie?

06:45.882 --> 06:47.684
Because if it's the same thing, why do we need it?

06:48.326 --> 06:52.432
So we try and create that element out of each title that's a unique kind of experience.

06:52.492 --> 06:57.741
And let's point out that of the 16 or 17 million images that you have access to,

06:58.025 --> 06:59.967
You've only done four CD roms.

07:00.047 --> 07:00.567
Exactly.

07:00.608 --> 07:05.652
So you're really choosing your targets quite mindfully and having a great deal of thought.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.593
Exactly.

07:06.854 --> 07:09.036
And how can we attach a narrative to this?

07:09.076 --> 07:10.057
We have all these images.

07:10.457 --> 07:12.259
How can we stitch them together to make something?

07:12.279 --> 07:13.400
That's the other part.

07:13.420 --> 07:19.286
The other half that's equally important is that it's not just about information.

07:19.866 --> 07:21.248
For us, it's about story.

07:21.988 --> 07:23.830
There has to be a good story.

07:24.046 --> 07:30.093
Because for me, story provides the context and background and interest to make you want to get into the material.

07:30.473 --> 07:34.437
And I think a lot of CD-ROMs started first from the reference model.

07:34.638 --> 07:37.200
Oh, look how much space we have here.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.081
Let's fill it up.

07:38.101 --> 07:43.768
Let's put the complete works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on CD-ROM.

07:43.808 --> 07:45.049
Great, all the text is there.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.431
Who wants to read it?

07:46.751 --> 07:48.112
You know a soul?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.475
You know anyone alive who has read a novel?

07:50.928 --> 07:52.670
page one to the end.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.451
On the computer screen?

07:54.492 --> 07:55.072
No way.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.173
Why would you bother?

07:56.213 --> 07:58.656
Nobody probably ever will.

07:58.676 --> 08:00.197
It's too much work.

08:00.237 --> 08:01.398
It just doesn't look right.

08:02.299 --> 08:06.624
The value of that is being able to have the computer search for information.

08:07.124 --> 08:09.066
That unquestionably has value.

08:09.086 --> 08:12.469
To be able to search across lots of books to find citations and passages.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.072
That's when you're doing directed search for information.

08:15.092 --> 08:16.493
That's in a reference mode.

08:17.674 --> 08:18.235
For me,

08:19.632 --> 08:23.496
how do you get somebody interested in a subject if they don't know anything about it?

08:23.997 --> 08:26.720
How do I know what to ask for if I don't know the first question to ask?

08:27.160 --> 08:29.503
And to me, that's the point of a CD.

08:30.263 --> 08:44.659
It's to create that kind of engagement, give you the background, allow you to explore, get you excited about it, know enough to help you find things that you're interested in that, and then you go and read more books about those particular areas.

08:44.699 --> 08:46.401
Then you want to go find other films.

08:46.801 --> 08:47.462
To me, it's

08:47.712 --> 08:51.676
a way of entering a subject area where you don't have a lot of background.

08:51.696 --> 08:54.400
Like for me, the first CD-ROM I did was a passion for art.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.583
Well, people always ask me, do you have an art history background?

08:57.603 --> 09:01.247
I mean, you know, and all this kind of stuff about art, and I said, you know, if you only knew.

09:01.287 --> 09:17.145
In college, you know, I took one class in art called Integrated Arts, and it was this huge auditorium with 500 people in there, and there was a professor that sat up in front, dark, and was flashing each slide on the screen, and the assumption was that you knew all about

09:17.378 --> 09:20.802
art and artists and all these other things through time, I had no context.

09:20.902 --> 09:28.952
I didn't remember anything because I didn't know any interesting stories that he was attaching to it, the interrelationships between things, one ear off the other.

09:28.972 --> 09:32.557
So how do you explain then this remarkable CD that you were able to produce?

09:33.358 --> 09:37.323
Because in a conversation I had with Ken Burns, he echoed kind of the same thing.

09:37.343 --> 09:42.289
He said, sometimes you have to be dumb as a stone and ask those questions.

09:42.329 --> 09:43.430
So wait a minute, wait a minute.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.774
Before you get into that, you know, what's the background here?

09:46.995 --> 09:47.335
You know,

09:47.872 --> 09:49.454
You have to create engagement first.

09:49.554 --> 10:00.264
All of our CDs start with this little opening, and it's about 90 seconds, 60 to 90 seconds long, that, in a nutshell, tells you the story, and it's a hook, just like the pre-title sequence of a movie.

10:00.724 --> 10:03.727
It grabs you and brings you in, and then you want to say, oh, well, that's interesting.

10:04.568 --> 10:05.249
Tell me more.

10:05.349 --> 10:08.031
You see, now, the Barnes story in particular is fascinating.

10:08.051 --> 10:08.412
It is.

10:08.432 --> 10:09.272
I mean, I happen to know it.

10:09.292 --> 10:10.714
I reviewed the book for Clark.

10:10.854 --> 10:11.515
There you go.

10:12.736 --> 10:17.220
You know, this thing was set up down in Philly, and nobody can go see it unless you have tremendous

10:17.707 --> 10:18.348
Right.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.132
And nobody even knew this stuff was there.

10:21.292 --> 10:28.742
People are making something available, but really is not otherwise available, I guess, anywhere else.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.323
Anywhere else.

10:29.523 --> 10:30.104
Yeah.

10:30.264 --> 10:31.385
But you also had a story.

10:31.786 --> 10:32.347
We had the story.

10:32.367 --> 10:37.874
We started with the story, and that was a little hook, and then the next thing we have is a little welcome by Carter Brown.

10:37.914 --> 10:40.137
And here is the counterpoint to the opening.

10:40.418 --> 10:45.925
Here's a guy who's head of the National Gallery of Art for 25 years, telling you that this is the greatest private collection

10:46.242 --> 10:48.426
you know, that a post-impression draft has ever been there.

10:48.486 --> 10:52.373
So there you go, wow, it's not just a sensational story about this guy collecting all these paintings.

10:52.674 --> 10:53.755
This is really significant.

10:54.136 --> 10:57.562
And then the next thing, there are four guided tours, and it starts broad.

10:58.003 --> 11:01.369
You know, the first question is, well, who is this guy Barnes, and where did he get his money?

11:01.409 --> 11:02.431
Why did he collect all these things?

11:02.451 --> 11:03.353
And that's the first story.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.456
And then the next thing narrows a little bit further.

11:05.837 --> 11:10.225
Then we take you through, but with a guy named Joe Richard, who's curator of European painting.

11:10.508 --> 11:11.489
at the Philadelphia Museum.

11:11.829 --> 11:20.358
Room by room, he talks about their major masterpiece, and you find out, my God, some of the greatest paintings of Matisse's career and these other artists are there, a place that people don't get into.

11:20.918 --> 11:23.581
Then you narrow a little bit further, thematically.

11:24.141 --> 11:30.307
Carter Brown does a tour, and he talks about the theme of the female nude in art.

11:30.748 --> 11:38.455
He talks about some of the same paintings that were mentioned earlier, but it's done a different way, so you get a little bit more context, and a little bit stories about different paintings as well.

11:38.756 --> 11:40.077
Then you narrow down to

11:40.715 --> 11:42.257
the story on the Matisse dance mural.

11:42.517 --> 11:45.021
It's an in-depth look at the creation of a single work of art.

11:45.321 --> 11:49.407
You've really kind of funneled it down to a case study of one work of art.

11:49.687 --> 11:59.541
And in that study, you learn about Matisse as a human being, that he worked on this painting, and he struggled, and he finally thought he was finished, and he realized he measured wrong and had to start all over again.

11:59.601 --> 12:02.866
And you learn about the creative process, but you learn about his humanity.

12:03.126 --> 12:04.608
He's not just some legendary artist.

12:04.628 --> 12:05.549
He's a real human being.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.532
And you're able to do this visually.

12:07.782 --> 12:09.905
You do it visually, you do it with music.

12:10.185 --> 12:14.971
I think the thing that really engages people about this title is the music.

12:15.391 --> 12:24.423
And because in a moment of the dance tour, there's a particular strong emotional moment in there, and we have a certain kind of music that goes with it.

12:24.743 --> 12:28.508
And then at the end of the title, we have closing credits, just like you do in a movie theater.

12:28.848 --> 12:36.658
And in those credits, we have that same music that echoes the same part of that particular tour, because I want people to think back about that experience they had

12:36.993 --> 12:40.898
And they have that experience when they're, quote, leaving the theater or leaving the title.

12:40.918 --> 12:44.883
And I had more people come to me and say, God, I love that music and that credit.

12:45.203 --> 12:46.965
It just makes me feel so good about the title.

12:47.285 --> 12:51.831
And it's very much orchestrating an experience from the very beginning to the very end.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.935
We're telling stories and shaping that experience.

12:54.955 --> 13:01.162
But what is it about this title that gives people something different than they don't get in a book as well or in a movie?

13:01.603 --> 13:05.127
It's the experience of recreating the barns, learning about

13:05.562 --> 13:11.910
You know, you're in the main gallery, room one, and you're looking at this wall, and you can go through these doorways and learn about this Van Gogh here in the corner.

13:12.410 --> 13:14.874
And what you're getting is you're getting a sense of scale.

13:14.954 --> 13:15.695
Wow, here's the wall.

13:15.735 --> 13:16.956
Look how big that painting is.

13:17.016 --> 13:17.857
I didn't know it was that big.

13:18.238 --> 13:26.468
And when you look in books and everything's reproduced the same size to fill the page to make it, you know, look as good as it's possible, you don't know if it's the size of a postage stamp or the size of a wall.

13:26.928 --> 13:27.329
Yeah.

13:27.349 --> 13:34.658
And the reason why I brought, I felt that was important is because when I was a kid, still not knowing any of my art,

13:35.026 --> 13:40.872
But in elementary school, they put little prints of art on the wall so that kids would become familiar with it.

13:41.373 --> 13:46.938
The only art I had seen was the dogs playing poker at home.

13:46.978 --> 13:50.562
So there was this picture by Suraj called Sunday in the Park on the Isle of Grunja.

13:51.203 --> 13:52.824
I never knew about that painting.

13:52.964 --> 13:54.226
I just remember that picture.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.168
And it was this big.

13:56.348 --> 14:00.392
It was about two feet by two feet on this print on the wall, and it was hung low because it was in second grade.

14:01.098 --> 14:09.190
And when I finally got as an adult to the Art Institute of Chicago and saw the real thing, it amazed me that the thing is the size of, you know, this huge wall.

14:09.210 --> 14:09.911
It's like a mural.

14:09.931 --> 14:13.136
And so I realized that art is something that's created at arm's length.

14:13.637 --> 14:15.660
So scale is important.

14:15.680 --> 14:22.610
So the idea is to try and communicate that sense of scale, attach stories to those things, learn about the artist, what he was doing.

14:23.492 --> 14:29.260
And we tried to put that in the experience in going through the gallery itself.

14:29.280 --> 14:29.541
Let me go.

14:29.701 --> 14:30.362
I just want to see.

14:31.051 --> 14:54.510
give me an idea of how you just described how you create a process if i may you know that they put together this cd now did you script it did you sit down i've got this material i mean it's like almost like writing a book it was almost like writing a story and producing a play and you've got music and you've got

14:55.013 --> 14:57.256
visual stuff, and you've got narration.

14:57.336 --> 15:04.223
It comes in succession, but the beginning of it probably is very much like what you do, which is thinking of a treatment.

15:05.084 --> 15:06.206
What is this going to be about?

15:06.306 --> 15:15.316
And for a passion for art, it was called something different back then, was just a one or two page description of what this thing could be.

15:15.436 --> 15:23.525
And for me, it was my way of synthesizing, okay, I don't know much about art, but what kind of art experience would I like to have?

15:24.106 --> 15:24.987
And for me, it's

15:25.338 --> 15:32.809
to be able to walk around the gallery with an expert telling me, you know, so what's the big deal?

15:32.829 --> 15:33.670
I don't know anything about it.

15:33.770 --> 15:35.373
And he'll tell you stories about the artist.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.334
He'll tell you about the work.

15:36.354 --> 15:39.138
He'll tell you about, you know, why it's important.

15:39.659 --> 15:41.181
And I need that.

15:41.702 --> 15:44.366
You know, to me, it's all about context.

15:44.426 --> 15:50.535
We created this timeline in A Passion for Art that we've included in a number of other titles where we put the works in

15:50.920 --> 15:54.404
by the artist sort of visually, chronologically, but you can see them over time.

15:54.485 --> 15:56.207
I've seen the Cezanne one, by the way.

15:56.227 --> 15:56.487
Oh, okay.

15:56.507 --> 15:58.910
And I love that you have the little... The little squares?

15:58.990 --> 16:00.953
The little pictures, yeah.

16:00.973 --> 16:01.213
Yeah.

16:01.313 --> 16:03.636
I mean, that's something you're not going to get someplace else.

16:03.897 --> 16:04.157
Right.

16:04.638 --> 16:14.771
But we tried to put other things, like events in music and literature and history, to give people context of, you know, oh, Stravinsky was working on the Rite of Spring when Renoir was being.

16:14.851 --> 16:16.573
I didn't know they were alive at the same time.

16:16.874 --> 16:18.917
you know, maybe there are some influences there.

16:19.238 --> 16:25.107
And that was sort of the beginning of thinking about, holistically, of how things interrelate, that art just isn't in isolation.

16:25.127 --> 16:28.873
So how do you see yourself as a writer, as a producer, as a director?

16:29.695 --> 16:36.165
Well, I think in that, my credit is producer and director, because there are two parts of that job.

16:36.325 --> 16:43.557
One is producing, which is the business part of, I hired the team, I got the project started,

16:43.790 --> 16:47.035
figured out the budget and the schedule and getting all these people going.

16:47.175 --> 16:51.662
So all these things are parts of the equation, aren't they?

16:51.682 --> 16:52.143
Exactly.

16:52.203 --> 17:05.464
And then the director part is, you know, I'm visualizing here's how I want this scene to look, here's the information, here's where you go from here, and directing people on how you want things to work and look, that's the directing part of it.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.190
Are you thinking in terms of a screen like this, whereas I have to believe I'm

17:09.592 --> 17:13.658
a Hollywood person that's thinking of a big screen or a TV person?

17:13.678 --> 17:14.059
I don't know.

17:14.079 --> 17:14.540
Same thing.

17:14.720 --> 17:22.371
I mean, what I did probably the second week of starting to work on A Passion for Art was storyboard.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.216
I drew on pieces of paper.

17:25.356 --> 17:27.019
Here's what the first thing.

17:27.039 --> 17:29.142
If you go here, you zoom in, and here's a wall.

17:29.202 --> 17:31.525
And if you click on the wall, you'll see a close-up.

17:31.606 --> 17:34.250
And if you go through this doorway, you'll end up going here.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.493
And I had these ideas of showing

17:37.368 --> 17:50.039
a map and having these little stick pins show up on the map, and there would be different artists and works, and you could slide the slider and see different pins and say, oh, wow, look, Renoir and Cezanne were painting at the same place at the same time.

17:50.439 --> 18:01.148
It turned out to be impossible to try and do that, but there were ideas like that where we'd just say, what would a really interesting experience be like, and what could we put up there?

18:01.168 --> 18:05.752
So in terms of the technology, what do you have to know about the technology?

18:05.772 --> 18:07.273
Well, I have to sort of know

18:07.608 --> 18:17.322
somewhat the bounds of the technology, what's possible, but I don't constrain myself to that.

18:17.722 --> 18:26.675
I mean, I think when we were thinking about Leonardo da Vinci, and I'll show you that, yeah, I mean, I'll show you the original treatment for it.

18:27.095 --> 18:30.160
I was present at the sale, by the way, when Boogings bought that.

18:30.180 --> 18:30.480
Oh, you were?

18:30.520 --> 18:31.942
And it's in my book, by the way.

18:31.962 --> 18:32.843
Oh, how exciting.

18:32.863 --> 18:36.889
I've always been very much interested in Codex, and when it was on display for four weeks,

18:37.291 --> 18:40.837
It was on display at the Corcoran for two weeks.

18:40.857 --> 18:41.618
That's right.

18:41.638 --> 18:43.841
And then right after it went from there, I went to L.A.

18:44.142 --> 18:45.484
County Museum, and I saw it there.

18:45.504 --> 18:46.786
It was on display for four weeks.

18:46.906 --> 18:49.670
That was 1981, I think in May or something, or March.

18:50.432 --> 18:51.533
When was it recent than that?

18:51.553 --> 18:51.734
81.

18:51.814 --> 18:53.276
You mean when it was sold?

18:53.476 --> 18:55.139
When it was first sold to Arm & Hammer.

18:55.159 --> 18:56.040
Oh, to Arm & Hammer.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.421
Yeah.

18:56.982 --> 18:57.122
Okay.

18:57.743 --> 19:00.247
I was at the sale that we built.

19:00.267 --> 19:01.208
Oh, Bill bought it.

19:01.228 --> 19:01.609
Okay.

19:01.829 --> 19:04.773
Oh, my interest goes... Even prior to that.

19:04.834 --> 19:05.274
Yeah, 1981.

19:06.256 --> 19:07.257
I was there.

19:07.277 --> 19:08.719
It was a whole consortium.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.923
And he helped bid the Italian government.

19:11.143 --> 19:12.185
Right.

19:12.425 --> 19:14.168
But he did a nice thing and loaned it back to them.

19:14.608 --> 19:18.694
I believe that he's going to take better care of it than anybody.

19:18.875 --> 19:22.220
Anybody who spends $30 million.

19:22.240 --> 19:22.640
You better.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.586
If you see my book, I'm

19:27.173 --> 19:31.739
I believe in the private owner of things, and it's the reason things are safe.

19:32.180 --> 19:34.363
That's an essential theme of my book.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.184
I'm sorry, Andrew.

19:35.224 --> 19:35.945
No, go ahead, Andrew.

19:35.965 --> 19:38.409
I love these side topics, too.

19:38.809 --> 19:42.414
Are you mindful of who your audience is when you're doing this?

19:43.055 --> 19:44.057
Well, yes or no.

19:44.077 --> 19:50.025
When I'm writing my book, I have a general idea who's going to read it, and you really hope that you're going to cross over.

19:50.410 --> 19:58.218
I know my core audience, I know what my bread and butter is, but I also know that if I tell a good story, I'm going to get that general audience, which I did.

19:58.278 --> 20:00.721
Well, that's exactly what I tried to do with a passion for art.

20:00.741 --> 20:14.114
I mean, I created it, in a sense, for me, somebody like me, who has an interest in art or knows that they should, or has wanted to have an interest in art, but maybe didn't have the time or wherewithal to learn more about it.

20:14.655 --> 20:18.679
And I had hoped by making it that accessible that I would then appeal to a larger audience.

20:19.030 --> 20:31.081
Because I knew if I created enough significant scholarly material in there or put enough interesting material in there, I'd appeal to the core audience of people who are really interested in the barns or really interested in the specific artists there.

20:31.161 --> 20:32.182
But I wanted to open it up.

20:32.242 --> 20:41.171
I wanted it to be a point of entry of learning about art so that from there they say, oh, yeah, well, now that I've learned all about Matisse, I want to see other Matisses that aren't in the barns.

20:42.712 --> 20:46.956
Very interesting, in a way, when we talk about the intended audience.

20:46.976 --> 20:48.818
And this is almost an enamel.

20:49.844 --> 20:54.570
a contradiction in a way.

20:54.590 --> 21:00.717
My kid, my 13-year-old daughter, you know, she's playing with these things.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.179
Literacy of the new generation.

21:02.259 --> 21:04.322
I got a new, you know, a new CD.

21:04.342 --> 21:06.404
She's the one that loads it and gets going.

21:06.785 --> 21:10.990
And they introduce, you know, the adult, so to speak.

21:11.410 --> 21:18.619
Are you mindful of the fact that children today, in this odd circumstance, this odd inversion, are more

21:19.021 --> 21:26.370
computer literate, shall we say, are capable, computer capable, than the adults who you might be trying to reach with the CD-ROM.

21:26.511 --> 21:32.478
Well, very much so, but I'm also trying to reach those kids, too, because, sure, they're interested in the technology.

21:32.558 --> 21:33.680
They're not interested in the art.

21:33.980 --> 21:37.485
I've had more cases of where they're interested in because they can play around with it.

21:37.925 --> 21:45.876
You know, this art, these stories and this thing about art are really interesting, and they learn about that, or they're going to learn about FDR, even though they didn't care about FDR, you know?

21:45.896 --> 21:47.678
You see, I review children's books, too.

21:48.080 --> 21:54.148
And I maintain, you know, if you're writing a children's book, you have to impress the parent first.

21:54.168 --> 21:57.313
I mean, if you're writing it and you're producing it, it's the parent.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.514
That's the one that's going to buy it.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.116
Buy the book for the kid.

22:00.136 --> 22:00.357
Right.

22:00.377 --> 22:01.458
Introduce it to the kids.

22:01.478 --> 22:04.402
I mean, you have this level, this filter that you have to go.

22:04.602 --> 22:05.664
It's like selling dog food.

22:05.684 --> 22:06.745
You're not selling to the dog.

22:07.086 --> 22:08.127
You're selling to the owner.

22:08.468 --> 22:09.589
Who cares what it tastes like?

22:09.629 --> 22:10.831
You want to see what the label is.

22:10.951 --> 22:12.433
In a way, but this is more...

22:12.582 --> 22:13.123
appeal.

22:13.323 --> 22:13.583
Sure.

22:14.224 --> 22:16.467
I'm sorry, you don't mind jumping around?

22:16.487 --> 22:17.668
No, we're having lots of fun.

22:17.868 --> 22:20.752
I am definitely having lots of fun.

22:20.772 --> 22:25.517
Do you have a sense of the shapes of things to come, books of the future, libraries of the future?

22:26.678 --> 22:31.684
Because that is, you know, do you not have a clue?

22:32.185 --> 22:33.346
Well, I think a lot about that.

22:33.566 --> 22:41.796
In fact, one of my, back in 1988, I filed a design patent for an idea that

22:42.907 --> 22:51.455
It was granted, I think, in 1991, and it dealt with reference books and, well, libraries and books in general, electronic books.

22:51.635 --> 22:57.661
Back then, it was, C. D. Browns were just coming out, and... 1988, and it was granted in 91.

22:57.941 --> 22:58.222
Yeah.

22:59.403 --> 22:59.543
Okay.

22:59.563 --> 23:01.365
It was with the patent office, I guess?

23:01.385 --> 23:01.665
Yeah.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.527
Patent office in D.C.

23:03.547 --> 23:07.751
You'll have to tell me your background at some point, too, but we'll get back to that.

23:07.951 --> 23:08.071
Yeah.

23:08.151 --> 23:12.255
Well, I remember as a kid, you know, when you're going to the library and you're doing research, and

23:12.691 --> 23:17.719
you know, great, I found these books, but the problem is they're reference books.

23:17.839 --> 23:18.901
I can't check them out.

23:19.342 --> 23:22.888
The other books you also want, they're checked out and they'll never be back because somebody took them.

23:22.908 --> 23:25.271
You know, that's sort of the frustration of working in the libraries.

23:25.291 --> 23:31.482
And I always felt that, you know, if they were on CD, then they wouldn't have to be reference books.

23:31.562 --> 23:34.847
Everybody could have them because you could stamp them out really, really cheaply.

23:34.887 --> 23:39.154
So I had this idea of creating an electronic book that you would slide a CD in and it would have

23:39.438 --> 23:51.370
a touch screen LCD and speakers on it and be no bigger than a regular hardback book that you could just carry around and you could go and these CDs would cost 50 cents a piece and you could just, you know, buy anything you want.

23:51.650 --> 23:54.132
Well, the CDs have started to happen.

23:54.152 --> 23:57.916
You know, you can get Encarta on a CD and the manufacturing cost is, you know, under a buck.

23:59.057 --> 24:00.218
But there's tons of them.

24:00.238 --> 24:03.381
So the concept of encyclopedia is not quite so referencing anymore.

24:03.421 --> 24:04.402
Everybody can have them.

24:04.802 --> 24:08.466
But the idea is that, you know, hopefully someday people will have

24:08.952 --> 24:14.339
an electronic book that starts to mimic a real book that has those kind of features to it.

24:14.399 --> 24:15.681
It'll be a screen?

24:15.701 --> 24:16.482
It'll be a screen.

24:16.562 --> 24:17.343
It'll be like a book.

24:17.403 --> 24:21.508
Hopefully the idea is that you won't be able to tell the difference in quality.

24:22.209 --> 24:24.052
We've got a ways to go before that's going to happen, apparently.

24:25.153 --> 24:26.815
How is it going to replicate a page?

24:27.456 --> 24:30.480
To show you a page exactly like a real page.

24:30.500 --> 24:38.250
The whole thing about, you know, you would actually have to flip a page and, well, you would press a button and it would flip the page looking like a page.

24:38.534 --> 24:42.221
Didn't Bill Gates do that with his own book?

24:42.341 --> 24:44.626
Yeah, in the back on his CD.

24:44.666 --> 24:45.487
That's on the CD.

24:45.788 --> 24:54.845
But the idea that I had was to create this device that would be a portable electronic hardback book that you could just put lots of CDs in.

24:55.066 --> 24:55.727
What did you call it?

24:57.831 --> 24:58.973
What did I call that thing?

24:59.830 --> 25:01.332
I'd like to check this out.

25:01.432 --> 25:03.754
Do you have some paperwork that you could send me on this?

25:03.814 --> 25:04.595
Yeah, I have it at home.

25:05.316 --> 25:06.377
I'll bring it.

25:07.138 --> 25:11.543
The idea was a patent on the design, an idea to create an electronic CD-ROM book.

25:13.565 --> 25:14.626
And they granted the patent?

25:14.886 --> 25:15.807
Yeah.

25:16.528 --> 25:18.870
This is my card.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.414
Never mind the title and stuff, just for my interest.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.057
My own little company, I do a syndicated call.

25:26.979 --> 25:27.880
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

25:29.463 --> 25:34.830
I sent a copy to the chairman of Apple back at that time, John Scully.

25:35.331 --> 25:41.359
He was interested in and also got a guy named Jean-Louis Gasset, who was head of technology at Apple that time, to look at it.

25:41.379 --> 25:45.084
And they were exploring devices, something like that, too.

25:45.504 --> 25:49.830
But they ultimately decided they didn't have the technology to create it at that time.

25:49.930 --> 25:55.357
So how can you get the patent on something for which there's no technology yet to produce it?

25:55.377 --> 25:56.960
Well, it's a design patent.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.862
It's an idea for, here's something that

25:59.905 --> 26:01.667
of how something might work.

26:01.747 --> 26:05.211
So it's probably very hard to be able to detect it then.

26:05.231 --> 26:05.451
Yeah, yeah.

26:05.471 --> 26:07.273
The guy who invented the weed eater, you know.

26:07.293 --> 26:09.215
Right, right, somebody else knocked it off.

26:09.255 --> 26:13.040
But I just thought, what the hell, I'll try and I'll just put this out there just to see.

26:13.060 --> 26:13.901
What were you doing then?

26:15.202 --> 26:24.853
Back then I was working for a company called The Voyager Company that started doing some of the very first, well, I started Voyager in like 90, but before then I was producing interactive video discs.

26:25.133 --> 26:25.554
Oh, you were?

26:25.754 --> 26:26.014
Yeah.

26:26.416 --> 26:28.579
So your background is in this stuff.

26:28.599 --> 26:29.801
Well, here's my background.

26:31.864 --> 26:32.305
Let's see.

26:32.866 --> 26:38.855
In college, I did student films, but I was at UCLA.

26:38.875 --> 26:47.167
I majored in environmental science, and I also have a minor in astronomy and physics, because that was an interest of mine, too.

26:47.828 --> 26:52.896
And I got out of school, and I pursued a career in environmental science, and I worked for...

26:53.230 --> 26:57.114
consulting company called Dames & Moore, their big environmental consulting firm.

26:57.135 --> 27:08.327
Went to another firm, and because at that time the whole environmental movement was kind of dying down, went to, at this other firm, I started doing more strategic planning, strategic management consultant.

27:08.347 --> 27:10.330
Was doing that for a while, very much in the business.

27:10.370 --> 27:15.015
I got my MBA while I was doing that, and I was pursuing the corporate route.

27:15.035 --> 27:21.803
And it's kind of weird, but after a while, I worked with a number of big companies, you know,

27:23.335 --> 27:26.359
I worked on the divestiture of Pacific Bell from AT&T.

27:26.419 --> 27:30.505
I did restructuring of big companies, government agencies.

27:32.487 --> 27:38.615
But it got to the time when you're working in consulting, you have to make a decision whether you want to be a partner or not.

27:39.036 --> 27:46.125
And I decided that, no, just making companies rich was not that fulfilling for me.

27:46.686 --> 27:50.271
And then to me, I was really much more interested in

27:50.723 --> 27:53.306
in education and teaching and things like that.

27:53.406 --> 27:54.867
And I was interested in film, too.

27:55.588 --> 28:14.148
And multimedia didn't exist at that time, but I kind of gave up the corporate business stuff, went into business for myself, doing some consulting, because I could make enough money to pay the bills working a couple days a week there, but doing other things that I liked.

28:14.188 --> 28:15.469
I got a teaching credential.

28:15.990 --> 28:19.313
I started working with schools.

28:20.525 --> 28:30.258
developed computer software doing some of the things that I was doing consulting, strategic planning, strategic management consulting.

28:31.439 --> 28:45.418
It's funny because the software I developed back then in the early days of computing, the first thing we did was on an Apple II, and that's pretty hard to do on an Apple II, and then we went to other machines, and eventually when the IBM PC came out, I developed the version for the IBM PC, but

28:45.803 --> 28:49.551
What did you call it?

28:50.092 --> 28:58.109
The name of it was Spans, which was an organization analysis software.

28:58.831 --> 29:01.416
Funny, I ended up talking to another guy who's the

29:01.885 --> 29:05.170
a Seattle partner of this firm that I used to work for.

29:05.190 --> 29:06.852
It's in a big international consulting firm.

29:06.932 --> 29:08.955
And he says, yeah, you're the creator of Spanish?

29:08.975 --> 29:09.957
I go, yeah.

29:09.977 --> 29:10.998
I said, what's it doing these days?

29:11.239 --> 29:14.944
Oh, it's a $40 million consulting practice.

29:14.964 --> 29:15.906
Creates it everywhere.

29:15.946 --> 29:17.208
It's been used all over the world.

29:17.288 --> 29:18.129
I said, well, that's great.

29:18.670 --> 29:24.659
But anyway, so I have this weird background of education, software, a little bit of dabbling in film.

29:24.699 --> 29:28.184
And one of my hobbies has been to sort of study feature film production anyway.

29:28.865 --> 29:29.766
And then...

29:30.488 --> 29:37.000
So in working with school districts, I ended up getting involved in doing some interactive educational video disc projects.

29:37.020 --> 29:39.525
And then from there, that's how I went to the Voyager company.

29:39.965 --> 29:42.991
They produced video discs, and they also produced some of the very first CD-ROMs.

29:43.672 --> 29:52.328
And they were kind of a... If you look in sort of the history of multimedia, they were generally considered to be

29:52.679 --> 29:56.503
the pioneers of creating really interesting things in multimedia.

29:56.563 --> 29:57.704
So you were a natural for them.

29:57.744 --> 29:59.526
How did you come into this position?

29:59.546 --> 30:04.171
This position, they were starting to do interactive multimedia here.

30:04.371 --> 30:06.393
It was called Continuum at that time.

30:06.874 --> 30:14.221
And I was recruited to come up here and help start doing CD-ROMs because that's what I had done for the Voyager company.

30:14.342 --> 30:16.984
And initially it would be in the nuts and bolts end of it?

30:17.004 --> 30:17.485
Creating.

30:17.785 --> 30:19.347
Creating these CDs, yeah.

30:20.208 --> 30:22.450
But how about now in selection of

30:23.037 --> 30:34.092
Charles was saying earlier, he sees this as what you're trying to do as a celebration of the high spots of the archive.

30:34.132 --> 30:49.494
There's no way you can ever make these stupid CD-ROMs out of everything that you have, but you see something really compelling that really suggests all the elements that you mentioned earlier that go into making a very effective thing to jump on it.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.036
How does that process work?

30:51.742 --> 31:13.890
It's a very complex mix of thinking about what we have in the archive, the different areas, what compelling stories there are out of there, intersecting that with, okay, who are the people that are interested in CD-ROM, have the capability of one of these machines, what are they interested in, and how does that intersect?

31:14.591 --> 31:19.437
And what are the different kinds of things that can show off

31:19.737 --> 31:26.183
different areas of the archive so that it's not just about art or science or history or something like that to try and diversify.

31:26.803 --> 31:29.205
So that's a pretty broad mix.

31:29.225 --> 31:36.972
And then when you're looking at the customer side, you also have to see how many are in that particular market segment and does it make sense.

31:37.873 --> 31:39.774
And that's always a challenge.

31:39.875 --> 31:44.258
So as the archive, are you involved in the acquisition of stuff?

31:45.980 --> 31:46.220
No.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.621
So that's Charles' area.

31:47.661 --> 31:48.422
That's Charles' area.

31:48.602 --> 31:49.643
We talked about that.

31:50.247 --> 31:53.192
So then you're working with what we've got.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.133
Working with what we have.

31:54.153 --> 31:55.015
This is what we've got.

31:55.335 --> 32:02.907
Well, we're working with what we have mostly, and also a little bit on what I'd like to do, too.

32:03.087 --> 32:06.933
I mean, you know, I was telling you about Leonardo da Vinci and my interest back in 1981.

32:07.334 --> 32:09.257
I can't wait to do that.

32:09.277 --> 32:14.024
Well, I mean, my pushing for that is a big reason why we're doing it.

32:14.866 --> 32:15.006
Mm-hmm.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.153
Actually, people think it's because Bill bought the codex.

32:17.173 --> 32:18.656
Well, that would be my assumption.

32:18.676 --> 32:21.481
Yeah, but it's actually not because I was related to that.

32:21.802 --> 32:23.926
I would have gotten to that.

32:23.946 --> 32:27.111
I would have just assumed that he got it.

32:27.452 --> 32:28.133
That's not the case.

32:28.233 --> 32:31.639
No, actually, it's funny because he bought that, and you know, of course, it went on tour.

32:32.521 --> 32:34.084
And so it's actually never been here.

32:34.164 --> 32:34.865
We've never seen it.

32:35.226 --> 32:38.091
The images that we have in the product of the Codex Lester are actually...

32:38.324 --> 32:41.728
the transparencies that Armand Hammer shot in 1981 when he first bought it.

32:41.748 --> 32:45.331
The ones I have in my Christie's catalog at home, in other words.

32:45.732 --> 32:46.212
Exactly.

32:46.613 --> 32:47.414
Exactly.

32:48.575 --> 32:57.004
So, you know, even though Bill owns it, there's very little he had to do with us doing it other than us asking him, you know, is it okay if we do this thing on Leonardo?

32:57.024 --> 32:58.305
He said, yeah, sure.

33:00.507 --> 33:04.551
I think what you're doing, what I've written, what I've written Publishers Weekly, sounds really exciting.

33:04.571 --> 33:06.053
Of course, Leonardo wrote backwards.

33:06.370 --> 33:12.776
in a language that most of us are going to be unable to decipher.

33:12.916 --> 33:13.217
Right.

33:13.237 --> 33:17.461
What you're going to do, apparently, is you can click onto a section here.

33:17.481 --> 33:17.921
I'll show you.

33:17.961 --> 33:18.702
Would you like to see?

33:18.722 --> 33:19.683
Yeah, I'd love to see that.

33:19.923 --> 33:20.123
All right.

33:20.143 --> 33:22.926
That's something that you're never going to get out of a book or anything.

33:22.946 --> 33:24.107
Exactly.

33:24.387 --> 33:27.250
Because I remember looking at the Codex, 1981.

33:27.330 --> 33:30.053
I thought, wow, look at these drawings.

33:30.073 --> 33:30.874
They're amazing.

33:30.914 --> 33:31.815
I'm looking at handwriting.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.116
I'm trying to make out letters.

33:33.697 --> 33:36.259
And I realized it's largely iconic.

33:37.083 --> 33:41.388
You know, it symbolizes this is something that Leonardo did.

33:42.048 --> 33:46.473
But I don't have the faintest clue about what's really going on in the writing.

33:46.893 --> 33:51.118
And sure, we've heard all our life, Leonardo is a genius, right?

33:51.959 --> 33:53.640
And it's pretty much third hand.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.584
How many of us have ever read Leonardo's writings?

33:56.604 --> 33:57.064
Nobody.

33:57.404 --> 33:58.986
And I said, that's what we have to do.

33:59.066 --> 34:02.770
We have to allow people to go in and really see his writings and

34:03.070 --> 34:06.176
And have an expert there at your side to tell you the significance of this.

34:06.216 --> 34:08.801
He was right about some things and he was wrong about some things.

34:08.822 --> 34:11.808
But to be able to see that, that's a magic connection.

34:12.088 --> 34:14.333
And that's one thing you're going to be able to do.

34:14.453 --> 34:17.399
And that's, you know, an inspiration, I think, in your part, really.

34:17.419 --> 34:18.341
Of course, it's made for us.

34:18.441 --> 34:19.543
It's Lord and Nicole.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.701
Well, where do you see it?

34:21.721 --> 34:23.183
And so what you're going to do now is penetrate.

34:23.524 --> 34:24.044
Yeah.

34:24.225 --> 34:25.867
And you're helping your reader.

34:26.047 --> 34:29.412
Do you call these people your readers, by the way, or your viewers, your customers?

34:29.552 --> 34:32.937
I like viewers, but some people end up calling them users.

34:33.678 --> 34:41.468
Users is probably the... But, you know, you know what I say about users is that there's only two businesses that have users and one's illegal.

34:43.832 --> 34:44.753
Oh, please.

34:44.773 --> 34:46.335
Yeah, no problem.

34:46.435 --> 34:47.276
Toss it over there.

34:48.959 --> 34:49.159
Oh, there.

34:54.978 --> 34:57.662
Now, what's that comet there?

34:57.682 --> 34:59.645
Oh, it's, you know, I'm very interested in astronomy.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.289
That was the last comet that just came.

35:03.211 --> 35:04.132
I saw it one night.

35:04.152 --> 35:07.898
Yeah, I mean, the comet was out there.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.121
Yeah, you have to be in a dark place.

35:10.482 --> 35:13.446
When you're in a dark place, boy, it was pretty amazing.

35:13.566 --> 35:16.170
It was pretty dark.

35:16.190 --> 35:17.172
Yeah.

35:17.192 --> 35:18.013
What are we doing?

35:19.876 --> 35:20.437
What's that?

35:20.457 --> 35:22.420
That was my little sound.

35:24.053 --> 35:26.336
Do you still do astronomy?

35:26.796 --> 35:28.338
Yeah, although not as much.

35:28.398 --> 35:29.439
I live in Seattle.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.741
When I was in L.A., I did a lot more.

35:34.585 --> 35:36.687
It seems to me the air is a lot clearer up here.

35:37.007 --> 35:42.513
Yeah, the air is clearer, but in astronomy, what matters is... You can do better astronomy in L.A.

35:43.034 --> 35:44.996
Yeah, if the clouds are there, it just doesn't work.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.121
Let me see.

35:49.141 --> 35:49.521
I'll turn.

35:51.813 --> 35:54.216
Can I grab an Altoid?

35:54.496 --> 35:54.957
Oh, please.

35:54.977 --> 35:55.838
That's what it's there for.

35:55.858 --> 35:56.819
It's pointed away.

36:10.657 --> 36:13.961
Save your tape.

36:14.722 --> 36:18.867
Oh, good.

36:22.728 --> 36:24.491
Here, why don't we stop it for just a second.

36:25.152 --> 36:25.853
I'm going to start it over.

36:25.873 --> 36:28.518
Things work, some things don't work, and it takes a little while.

36:28.898 --> 36:33.385
They haven't gone through the process of optimizing to make sure it runs fast on the CD yet.

36:33.406 --> 36:36.290
They just put it on the CD so all the elements are there.

36:37.673 --> 36:41.599
Now, these are your technicians who are... Right, they're down on the second floor working.

36:41.619 --> 36:48.190
And I took a walk through the room.

36:48.210 --> 36:48.330
Okay.

36:48.867 --> 36:53.092
Just pick it up just to get the audio.

36:53.172 --> 37:03.524
Are these things scripted to run a certain length?

37:04.005 --> 37:12.775
Excellent.

37:12.815 --> 37:15.178
Good for you.

37:15.462 --> 37:19.887
that the title of the main purpose was.

37:19.907 --> 37:27.835
Painting is the way to know the maker of all marvelous things.

37:27.855 --> 37:36.023
In order to give the true science of the flight of birds, heaven must first give the science of the wind.

37:36.043 --> 37:45.233
The air moves like a fervent, carries the clouds with us as it be seen in ancient trees.

37:45.213 --> 37:55.426
The genius of man may make various images, but it will never discover a more beautiful one than nature says.

37:55.586 --> 37:59.532
I am not to be accused of idleness.

38:02.816 --> 38:07.342
Well, that'll run a lot smoother when those things are going.

38:09.404 --> 38:11.487
All right.

38:11.507 --> 38:12.248
I don't know if the welcome is there.

38:12.268 --> 38:12.829
Maybe there is a welcome.

38:12.849 --> 38:14.511
We'll see.

38:15.183 --> 38:33.088
Ever since I was a child, I have been both fascinated and inspired by Leonardo da Vinci.

38:34.030 --> 38:44.785
The notebooks of this Italian Renaissance genius reflect the creative potential of the human mind, the power of invention, and the revelation in discovery.

38:45.659 --> 38:49.503
I've always admired Leonardo as a visionary in so many ways.

38:50.283 --> 38:52.325
He was hundreds of years ahead of his time.

38:53.326 --> 39:07.259
Using his extraordinary abilities as an artist and scientist, he pursued such questions as why the sky is blue, why the moon shines, and why seashells are found on mountain tops.

39:07.279 --> 39:13.405
His paintings, drawings, and manuscripts hold the answers to these questions.

39:13.807 --> 39:16.850
and reflect his profound understanding of nature.

39:17.991 --> 39:22.855
The Codex Leicester is a remarkable example of Leonardo's mind at work.

39:25.477 --> 39:33.084
It is fitting that this great thinker and artist would inspire creative and technological achievements in multimedia.

39:33.945 --> 39:39.010
This CD-ROM allows you to examine Leonardo's ideas as never before.

39:39.830 --> 39:42.733
For example, our unique translation tool

39:43.068 --> 39:47.494
The Codoscope truly brings the writings of Leonardo to life.

39:48.716 --> 39:55.786
It is my sincere hope that this project will help others draw as much inspiration from Leonardo as I have.

39:57.448 --> 39:58.670
Was it your idea to have him introduce it?

39:59.511 --> 40:00.272
It wasn't my idea.

40:00.472 --> 40:01.053
Very cool.

40:01.073 --> 40:02.335
But we think it's appropriate.

40:02.395 --> 40:11.708
This is Professor Martin Kemp, who is the professor of art history at Oxford, and widely considered to be one of the one or two scholars on Leonardo in the world.

40:13.342 --> 40:16.525
So who, now, where are you getting the authorities?

40:17.687 --> 40:19.088
Do people recommend them?

40:19.529 --> 40:27.818
Well, when we first started this project, part of my work was to figure out who's who and start to negotiate and deal with him.

40:27.838 --> 40:31.241
So I went to England and met with him.

40:31.281 --> 40:36.207
I had spoken with a number of people and the only name that kept coming up was Martin Kent.

40:37.228 --> 40:37.548
Yeah.

40:38.129 --> 40:41.172
And he has a great background in

40:41.371 --> 40:43.615
art, but also in natural science.

40:43.635 --> 40:45.358
So he's a great combination for both.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.263
I just want to see the CODIS.

40:48.283 --> 40:51.107
Yeah, no, I... Yeah, well, we'll cut right to the chase here.

40:51.127 --> 40:52.049
Yeah, it's very cool.

40:52.109 --> 40:53.892
We're going to move on to Doug.

40:53.912 --> 40:55.194
He's got to leave us.

40:55.214 --> 40:56.917
Why don't you do that right now, then?

40:56.977 --> 40:59.241
Well, no, you have a few minutes to see this.

40:59.301 --> 41:01.264
I'll go right to the CODIS scope here, and you can look.

41:01.304 --> 41:02.166
And then you can come back.

41:02.346 --> 41:03.268
Okay.

41:03.288 --> 41:06.934
I think we've covered most of the stuff, too, so... Okay.

41:06.954 --> 41:07.615
And whatever...

41:08.573 --> 41:12.178
He's going to be working on the book for a while, so we can always come back and follow up.

41:12.198 --> 41:17.624
I probably will even come back here at some point, you know, down the line.

41:17.644 --> 41:25.494
Okay, so these are all the pages of the Codex, and there are a number of themes that appear in the different pages, and you can mouse over them.

41:25.514 --> 41:26.175
Oh, that's wild.

41:26.195 --> 41:27.837
There should be 72 pages there.

41:27.857 --> 41:28.518
Yep.

41:29.459 --> 41:30.801
There's also an introduction.

41:31.982 --> 41:33.424
So you just punched into one.

41:34.045 --> 41:34.125
Yep.

41:35.320 --> 41:39.385
And, in fact, if you go to any other section, you can kind of see what else is there.

41:39.425 --> 41:44.211
But you can go get insights about this page, get a synopsis, look at the written order of it.

41:44.251 --> 41:44.992
So here's the page.

41:45.072 --> 41:46.074
Oh, that's great.

41:46.094 --> 41:46.694
Look at that.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.917
It's easier to see if you flip it around.

41:49.758 --> 41:51.761
So you can see, look.

41:53.563 --> 41:56.106
What I want to see is how you... Oh, there it is.

41:56.207 --> 42:00.552
That's really... That is spectacular.

42:00.835 --> 42:02.678
Look at the words here.

42:03.199 --> 42:04.201
He's talking to you.

42:04.241 --> 42:08.328
Remember how I have to demonstrate first the distance of the earth and find out his true size?

42:11.053 --> 42:12.917
You just couldn't do this anywhere else.

42:13.277 --> 42:17.665
I mean, with a book, I don't know how a book could do it unless you have these overlays.

42:17.805 --> 42:18.306
Yeah.

42:18.567 --> 42:19.568
Look at this.

42:19.588 --> 42:23.856
You can see a literal translation of his writing and start to check out the words.

42:25.405 --> 42:26.246
Congratulations.

42:26.266 --> 42:27.868
That's really spectacular.

42:27.888 --> 42:28.349
Isn't that great?

42:28.569 --> 42:33.014
It would be a very powerful tool, I think, to help people to understand and interpret the document.

42:33.034 --> 42:38.060
But also, you know, there's a brand new book out now called Great Books, a guy by the name David Denby.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.244
I'm going to be on a panel with him in Miami next November.

42:42.606 --> 42:49.854
And, you know, he went back to college to read the great books he read 30 years earlier in his, you know, when he was an undergraduate at Columbia.

42:50.395 --> 42:52.898
Leonardo Boyd insisted on observation.

42:54.346 --> 42:55.809
Who understands these things?

42:55.829 --> 43:00.016
Who has the time to go and look up a... But you've made this stuff accessible.

43:00.056 --> 43:01.799
Together, all the references from so many areas.

43:01.839 --> 43:03.642
You've actually made... That's right, yeah.

43:03.722 --> 43:04.764
It's in context.

43:05.285 --> 43:09.132
I remember seeing a literal translation of it, but I go, where is that?

43:09.192 --> 43:11.656
Where is that illustration you're talking about?

43:12.197 --> 43:13.920
And this is a way to keep them both together.

43:13.940 --> 43:15.162
That's terrific.

43:15.182 --> 43:15.803
That's great.

43:15.823 --> 43:16.685
I'll shut this off.

43:17.406 --> 43:17.907
We'll go see...
