WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:09.526
And we're talking with Glen Dawson at his bookstore in Los Angeles.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.869
And how long have you been here, sir?

00:12.889 --> 00:18.375
Well, in this location, 20 years or so, however, I'm a second generation bookseller.

00:19.115 --> 00:27.123
My recollections go back to 1928, and my father took me to Europe.

00:27.143 --> 00:27.764
And so you're mentioning Maggs.

00:27.784 --> 00:31.708
A few minutes ago, we met Benjamin Dawson Maggs, and my father,

00:32.178 --> 00:38.506
one of the original Mack's fathers.

00:38.526 --> 00:57.309
The Mack's family came from Manchester, and the father's family came from Manchester, but they joked about being cousins, whether or not.

00:57.329 --> 00:57.810
I don't know what it is.

00:57.830 --> 00:58.611
Dawson was a name in the Mack's family.

00:58.631 --> 01:00.413
So we had a grand tour in 1928, so I've been connected with the book business ever since.

01:01.658 --> 01:11.049
you say, with the book business, was your mindset, so to speak, as a bookseller, as a businessman, or as a collector?

01:11.069 --> 01:12.871
I wonder how you kind of emerged.

01:12.891 --> 01:31.412
Well, as a bookseller, as an antiquarian bookseller, and that was because my father, that was what he wanted, and he made it very easy for me in giving me trips and teaching me and making this, but I have never thought of being anything

01:31.882 --> 01:40.613
of course I did have a tour to Italy, paid for by the U.S.

01:40.733 --> 01:46.280
Army, but other than that, either in school or in this business.

01:46.300 --> 01:51.046
Did you see it as a profession or did you see it as a passion?

01:51.206 --> 01:53.329
I mean, was it a passion for you?

01:56.212 --> 01:58.175
Well, it's what I enjoy doing.

01:58.235 --> 02:00.758
If I go on a trip, why, then I enjoy

02:01.278 --> 02:11.593
visiting libraries and bookshops.

02:11.613 --> 02:15.599
I don't know about passion, but certainly it's been my life and I wouldn't do anything else.

02:15.619 --> 02:17.782
Have you ever collected yourself?

02:17.802 --> 02:28.297
I have a small collection of books about books, bibliographies, which I can justify as being tools.

02:28.317 --> 02:30.120
I have a very few books

02:30.556 --> 02:40.811
I have collected books, which Dawson's Bookshop has published or distributed, and that has several hundred volumes there.

02:40.831 --> 02:51.947
I do have a personal collection of pamphlets printed in Los Angeles before 1877.

02:51.967 --> 02:57.795
The idea of that was that it would fit on a shelf, and the theory is that if I

02:58.298 --> 03:00.120
add an item, I take an item out.

03:01.482 --> 03:05.928
In bulk, it's not going to be great.

03:05.948 --> 03:07.791
The quality is involved.

03:07.811 --> 03:09.533
More or less the way Samuel Peeps collected.

03:09.553 --> 03:11.235
He kept it at 3,000.

03:11.896 --> 03:14.259
If it got any more than that, he would weed out those.

03:14.340 --> 03:18.826
But he kept the library precisely at 2,000 volumes.

03:18.946 --> 03:26.536
Well, it's hard to do when you get a nice item as to what's going to be disposed of.

03:26.696 --> 03:28.018
I did not realize that you had

03:29.011 --> 03:41.549
been in a position to see the book, and I hesitate to use the word trade, but the business, the world, for half a century, at least.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.330
You have watched it.

03:42.350 --> 03:45.595
Has it changed dramatically, or are we still the same?

03:45.615 --> 03:47.938
I can see changes.

03:48.960 --> 03:58.393
For instance, my father bought one lot, and I bought another lot from Lathrop Harper, and he had a lot of incandulized 15th century books.

03:59.234 --> 04:04.341
And I bought 100 of them for $15 a piece.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.908
Now they had some imperfections.

04:08.928 --> 04:13.715
They needed binding or they had a pay job or something was wrong with them.

04:13.735 --> 04:24.010
But nevertheless, those same books that I paid $15 a piece now would easily be worth $1,500 a piece average.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.640
a change in my own lifetime in that moment.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.561
What kinds of books did you say?

04:28.581 --> 04:29.703
They were in funerals?

04:29.723 --> 04:30.363
In funerals.

04:30.443 --> 04:32.666
I know what they were, but I didn't know whether or not they were.

04:32.886 --> 04:35.369
You bought some in funerals for $15 a piece?

04:35.389 --> 04:37.832
A hundred of them.

04:37.852 --> 04:38.132
My God.

04:38.152 --> 04:49.705
And Lathrop Parker thought I was going to sell them to Hollywood Motion Picture Stars and so on, but actually we listed them and sold them back to his own customers in East Coast Libraries.

04:49.765 --> 04:50.606
Who was Lathrop Parker?

04:50.626 --> 04:51.287
I'm not familiar with you.

04:51.307 --> 04:52.528
Well, Lathrop Parker was one of the

04:53.538 --> 05:01.608
old booksellers that I met as a young man.

05:01.668 --> 05:02.209
He was a publisher.

05:02.229 --> 05:16.507
He probably had some money in real estate or other reasons, but Laper Parker was instrumental in forming some of the really great collections.

05:16.527 --> 05:19.290
And he was based, did you say, in New York?

05:19.310 --> 05:20.592
And he had an interest in

05:22.495 --> 05:28.120
I'm selling early printed books on books relating to history of America.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.523
Now you say you succeeded your father in the business.

05:30.563 --> 05:33.265
When did your father start the business?

05:33.285 --> 05:42.714
My father started business for himself in 1905 and passed away around 1945.

05:44.035 --> 05:49.761
So my brother and I left the business as equal partners.

05:49.781 --> 05:52.063
And so you have worked with your brother for—

05:52.465 --> 06:01.575
He's currently the president of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Americans.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.197
Oh, really?

06:03.237 --> 06:07.321
We're going to see Lou Weinstein tomorrow.

06:07.341 --> 06:10.805
The later generation, I guess.

06:10.865 --> 06:16.611
Lou Weinstein has been an officer in the ILAD, International League of Antiquarian Booksellers.

06:16.671 --> 06:22.337
He's been a treasurer, and that's a position that I held a few years ago.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.636
You mentioned movie stars and movie people.

06:24.876 --> 06:34.427
Would you say the movie industry does support the book collecting passion at all?

06:35.108 --> 06:35.849
Well, partially.

06:35.949 --> 06:49.185
Sometimes there's a director or a writer, or it can be one of the stars that has shown some interest, but most of them not.

06:51.292 --> 07:07.097
I was at the Library of the Library of Lionel Barrymore, and I was a person at the auction of the effects of John Barrymore, and a few books included.

07:07.217 --> 07:16.752
Gene Hershoff was really a collector and a scholar.

07:16.772 --> 07:18.194
Generally speaking, the motion picture stars have not been a collector.

07:18.214 --> 07:18.515
I have nothing.

07:18.535 --> 07:19.476
There are a few.

07:19.743 --> 07:26.289
We're going to see John Marroquette tonight, as a matter of fact.

07:26.309 --> 07:26.870
He's on the television show.

07:26.890 --> 07:29.132
He's quite a passionate collector of modern firsts.

07:30.813 --> 07:37.279
A few producers, I guess, as well, the new Bill Self.

07:37.299 --> 07:40.322
Do you know Bill Self?

07:40.342 --> 07:41.483
Obviously, he has a pretty remarkable Dickens collection.

07:41.503 --> 07:47.168
Well, generally, how would you characterize, basically, your entire life,

07:47.637 --> 07:51.941
in the buying and selling of antiquarian books.

07:51.961 --> 07:58.086
Do you have a fix on what kind of person it is that becomes so passionate about books?

07:58.106 --> 08:03.571
What kind of person becomes a bibliomaniac, to use a phrase?

08:04.692 --> 08:10.557
No, it could come from any profession or any economic status.

08:10.577 --> 08:17.323
One of the most remarkable collectors was Michael D. Hurley, who was

08:18.248 --> 08:35.311
worked as a postal clerk and never married, never had a car, wore the same suit year in and year out, and got all his energy and all his resources going into buying books.

08:35.331 --> 08:40.499
Michael D. Hurley, H-U-R-L-E-Y, and this was a California man?

08:40.519 --> 08:47.428
Yeah, California, and he left without a will and the books went to the county

08:47.662 --> 08:57.512
administrator, but through, I guess, his sisters, we were able to get some of the books.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.875
How would you describe the collection?

09:00.895 --> 09:08.603
Well, it was a collection of English literature and rare books of all kinds.

09:08.623 --> 09:08.863
Great.

09:08.883 --> 09:13.288
I mean, the quality you would judge is— Great quality.

09:13.308 --> 09:14.068
That's good.

09:14.088 --> 09:15.610
And when did he die?

09:15.944 --> 09:19.369
Well, we've got a couple of catalogs I can find for you here.

09:19.389 --> 09:29.802
This is very interesting to me, because he does represent the kind of collector who, I would say, on the surface of just what you've told me, didn't have a tremendous amount of money to throw into this.

09:29.822 --> 09:33.948
I don't necessarily want to just profile a millionaire collector.

09:33.968 --> 09:39.435
You know, I'm also interested in a person of more modest means, and then who is able to pursue the passion.

09:39.555 --> 09:45.343
We had an Arnold Hyland, who was also a bachelor,

09:45.880 --> 09:59.217
He was an art director for Fleur Corporation, and I'm buying now a collection of Robert Shearer, but that's a lesser one.

09:59.297 --> 10:10.492
Of the collectors that I've known, I would say that one of the greatest, he had the money and the skill, and it was Thomas Streeter.

10:10.512 --> 10:14.157
I've got Bradley Martin's copy of the Streeter catalog.

10:14.177 --> 10:15.178
I bought it at the Martin State.

10:15.817 --> 10:24.971
Yes, he was a very satisfactory collector, because if I wrote him by air mail, he wrote back by air mail.

10:24.991 --> 10:28.476
I telegraphed him, he telegraphed by return mail.

10:28.496 --> 10:44.541
And he would either say, I'll buy the book, I want an approval, or he'll say, I think your price is too high, or I think your price is very fair, but I bought one two weeks ago, and it would ever stop.

10:45.061 --> 10:54.990
He would buy from me promptly, and he would pay promptly, or he would tell me what he thought of the book.

10:55.010 --> 11:01.556
Or he would give me the information about the book if he wasn't going to buy it himself.

11:01.576 --> 11:06.440
And then he did a rather tremendously remarkable thing, which I have to write about in my book.

11:06.821 --> 11:10.484
It may not be unique, but it's quite extraordinary.

11:10.504 --> 11:14.848
In his will, he put the vast amount of his collection up for auction.

11:15.520 --> 11:28.475
But he did say to places like the American Antiquarian Society and a number of other important collections, all right, I will comp you up to, say, $100,000, $150,000, and you can go buy what you want at the auction.

11:28.495 --> 11:32.419
In other words, he wanted to really... That was something he got the idea from some other collection.

11:32.439 --> 11:35.963
I don't know what the wholesale or what it was, but it was not a unique idea.

11:35.983 --> 11:36.965
Ho didn't do that at all.

11:36.985 --> 11:37.445
Ho didn't do it.

11:37.485 --> 11:39.588
Somebody did, but any... Brinley made it.

11:39.648 --> 11:40.328
Brinley made it.

11:40.368 --> 11:41.890
Brinley, I think.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.413
But it was...

11:45.136 --> 11:56.595
However, for the heirs, it probably increased the interest in the sale and drove the prices up so that it was not as much a sacrifice to the estate as you want to think.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.458
Well, I think the estate was thrilled.

11:58.678 --> 12:04.387
Well, you know, he could have just given the collections to these institutions.

12:04.407 --> 12:06.731
He was not a man without means.

12:06.751 --> 12:11.599
I don't think the heirs would have been left destitute if he had given those collections away.

12:12.355 --> 12:22.969
But it was an interesting, I guess the correspondence at the AAS is full of Streeter writing back and forth with Clarence Brigham.

12:23.189 --> 12:32.361
He had quite a correspondence going with Henry R. Wagner, who was one of the great collectors.

12:32.381 --> 12:36.085
So, now, Streeter bought generally what kinds of things from the Americana, the Californian stuff?

12:36.105 --> 12:37.207
Well, it was Americana.

12:37.247 --> 12:38.869
He was interested in the

12:39.203 --> 12:42.507
He wrote a bibliography called Americana Beginnings.

12:42.988 --> 12:51.119
He was interested in the first printing or the first book about each state of each region of the United States.

12:51.139 --> 12:56.766
And so I was able to find some things for him from the Robert Callum collections and other places.

12:59.910 --> 13:07.320
And the interesting thing is that in his catalog, he gives, in many cases, the source of where he bought the book.

13:07.638 --> 13:14.066
So, you'll see Dawson's Bookshop mentioned as a source for quite a few interesting things.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.407
He was a scholar-collector.

13:15.627 --> 13:17.269
Would you think that's a fair answer?

13:17.289 --> 13:19.632
Yes, I think he was a scholar.

13:19.652 --> 13:28.062
I think each morning he took his mail and answered it that day and did research.

13:28.482 --> 13:33.268
He was really a great collector.

13:33.328 --> 13:35.190
Another great collector was Everett Graham.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.493
I think his collection went to the Newbury Library.

13:38.030 --> 13:44.198
I knew him, but he was rather frustrating for me, because if he already had it, he didn't want it.

13:44.219 --> 13:55.434
He didn't see anything, and then I didn't know if he was on a trip, or was away, or what, because then he would be unhappy if I sold the book.

13:57.096 --> 13:59.099
So, frequently T.W.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.484
Streeter got first choice, never draft got second.

14:02.504 --> 14:05.708
Did you meet Mr. Streeter, or was it

14:06.160 --> 14:31.847
I think he was in the shop a time or two, but I visited him once and had my three children, my wife and three children, and he got one of his—the woman that took care of his children to come over that day, and he had a guest house down below with a swimming pool.

14:32.367 --> 14:40.239
The kids had a marvelous time swimming and being at head lunch and down with this woman down there.

14:40.259 --> 14:47.610
And my wife and I were up and had lunch up above and viewed his walk-in safe and so on.

14:47.630 --> 14:50.014
Let's go back to Mr. Fellow Hurley that you mentioned earlier.

14:50.034 --> 14:51.897
He does really fascinate me.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.921
Can I just see if I can get a picture?

14:54.961 --> 14:55.062
Sure.

14:55.082 --> 15:00.670
That's a picture of Mr. Hurley working at the post office, right?

15:01.257 --> 15:03.141
Tell me a little bit about him.

15:03.421 --> 15:06.708
Well, he grew up in Iowa, I think it was.

15:06.728 --> 15:14.383
We've got a little brief biography of him.

15:14.403 --> 15:21.797
He, on a number of occasions, worked for us as a shipping clerk.

15:22.250 --> 15:31.741
We would pay him something, or sometimes he would just come in and work without pay, but he liked to be here when libraries came in, so he'd have first crack at things.

15:31.801 --> 15:34.585
That's delightful.

15:34.605 --> 15:34.865
Oh, boy.

15:35.986 --> 15:37.328
And he worked at the post office?

15:37.348 --> 15:39.791
Did he have any kind of special background?

15:40.411 --> 15:49.422
Well, he was very accurate and very conscientious, and he liked to work the night shift.

15:50.043 --> 15:56.333
He was also a time clerk to keep track of people's time and check them in and check them out and so on.

15:56.353 --> 16:01.362
So he had a responsible position and he was very dependable.

16:01.522 --> 16:07.432
But he preferred to work Sundays and preferred to work nightshifts.

16:07.492 --> 16:09.095
He got a little more money for nightshifts.

16:09.816 --> 16:12.660
And do you think this was so he could make more money to spend on books?

16:13.201 --> 16:16.607
Well, he had no particular...

16:17.060 --> 16:23.269
Sunday the bookshops were closed, so we might as well work that day.

16:23.289 --> 16:25.172
Did he prowl all the bookshops?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.974
Well, he did.

16:27.815 --> 16:37.449
But he not only bought here, but he bought at auction, and he bought from dealers like Lota and Mags.

16:37.569 --> 16:45.801
At that time he had no bank accounts, so he had to make money orders out.

16:46.017 --> 16:52.084
Sometimes he'd have the books shipped here if he were successful.

16:52.104 --> 17:00.014
If he made a big bid on a thing at auction, he would be all pins and needles to know whether he got it or not.

17:00.094 --> 17:05.100
Did you have some sense of how strong his collection was prior to his death?

17:05.120 --> 17:05.661
Well, we knew it.

17:05.741 --> 17:14.792
Of course, the latter part of his life, while he was filling his garage full of junk, and he was a great reader, and had certain

17:15.532 --> 17:23.523
Authors he liked, Woodhouse, W. W. Jacobs, A. A. Milne, and all those people.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.869
And he would collect in depth, and he would collect autographs and all kinds of things.

17:27.989 --> 17:28.530
I'll show you his account.

17:28.590 --> 17:29.391
I'd love to see it.

17:29.932 --> 17:33.817
But he made no provision for its disposition, though.

17:33.837 --> 17:43.210
No, he—Tom Neal, who worked for us, would kid him along about leaving the collection to here and so on.

17:43.477 --> 17:52.926
But he left no will, and he was saying he was perfectly willing to have his books put in the dump on him along with it.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.607
Do you say that?

17:54.627 --> 17:54.847
Yeah.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.969
Do you think he meant that?

17:56.989 --> 18:01.653
Well, he just had no provision, whatever.

18:01.673 --> 18:03.855
Well, what do you think the kick was for him?

18:03.996 --> 18:07.519
Just the ownership of them?

18:07.559 --> 18:08.820
He was very competitive.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.222
There were some books that

18:11.962 --> 18:20.832
There were a hundred numbered copies made, some Shelley thing, and he had three or four of them, and I guess his dream was to get every one of them.

18:20.852 --> 18:22.975
This was a Shelley type of a thing?

18:23.035 --> 18:24.777
He liked Shelley and Keats, particularly.

18:24.797 --> 18:27.720
Did he have any Thomas J. Weiss things, I wonder?

18:27.741 --> 18:30.744
Yeah, I think he did.

18:31.325 --> 18:33.287
And then when he died, what happened?

18:33.387 --> 18:35.009
I mean, how did things progress?

18:35.029 --> 18:36.931
How recently did he die, by the way?

18:36.951 --> 18:38.213
How recently did he die?

18:38.233 --> 18:40.956
Well, I could check on the catalog here and look at that.

18:41.493 --> 19:03.140
He had a Filipino girl who was an associate of his at the post office, and she tipped off the sisters, and the sisters got in touch with us, and so anyway, we got the county administrator to let us take a couple hundred items of our choice out of his house.

19:04.221 --> 19:10.048
And then when the things were, a large part of the bulk was sold at auction by the county administrator.

19:11.058 --> 19:13.582
Out here in California?

19:13.602 --> 19:13.902
In California.

19:13.943 --> 19:15.705
Did it have, was it a successful sale?

19:16.346 --> 19:23.778
Well, the county naturally takes a lot of fees in handling it.

19:23.818 --> 19:25.000
Oh, sure.

19:25.020 --> 19:25.961
That's a great story.

19:26.642 --> 19:28.806
Was it written up at all in the local press?

19:28.826 --> 19:31.730
Well, there were some things on it.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.695
This is a delightful little story.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.700
Did he ever talk about his passion for books?

19:37.720 --> 19:39.242
No, he talked about it.

19:40.117 --> 19:57.576
I think that the collector that is the most unusual, however, is the one that I have most recently been connected with, and what I can really say at this point for publication, I don't know, but have you heard of a Stephen Blumberg?

19:57.737 --> 19:58.758
Stephen Blumberg, yes.

19:59.078 --> 20:02.822
He's now in Omaha, Nebraska, I think.

20:02.842 --> 20:08.048
Well, that was—I've had the collections—I've had something to do with the formation.

20:08.770 --> 20:19.099
or disposal or and disposal of a number of collections, Thomas Treeter, Everett Graff, Edith Gallier, Mrs. Goheny, and so on.

20:19.400 --> 20:19.800
Thank you.

20:19.820 --> 20:21.802
All of whom are in my book, by the way.

20:21.982 --> 20:27.727
I interviewed DeGoglia's granddaughter, Michelle Marcia Carter, in Washington, D.C.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.169
W.J.

20:29.189 --> 20:31.531
Holliday is another.

20:31.551 --> 20:38.457
At any rate, Steve Blumberg, the ABAA, was looking for somebody to go back to do some appraisal work for him.

20:38.808 --> 20:43.293
KBA paid my airfare back to... This is after his arrest by the FBI?

20:43.534 --> 20:46.277
After his arrest.

20:46.417 --> 20:50.081
And so I spent eight days back there.

20:50.101 --> 20:52.944
In Omaha or in Iowa?

20:53.425 --> 20:54.026
In Omaha.

20:54.046 --> 20:59.012
And so it's quite possible that I'll be the government witness.

20:59.032 --> 21:07.161
It's just about now the indictment is coming through, but the FBI tells me that

21:07.765 --> 21:25.704
The defense attorney has got to ask for a postponement of the trial, because they've taken four months or so to prepare all this stuff, and the attorney can't even look at it unless he has a lot of time.

21:25.724 --> 21:28.367
I've talked to the FBI on this, too.

21:28.387 --> 21:29.388
Terry Tucker?

21:29.408 --> 21:30.449
Terry Tucker, and he's another guy.

21:30.469 --> 21:32.572
I'm in touch with the U.S.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.773
Attorney out there.

21:34.799 --> 22:03.051
Fascinating story because this is a the first few stories that were broken on this, they're calling him a bibliomaniac, which isn't right. He's a bibliokleptomaniac. Kind of a little difference I think. But you well I've had a lot of experience with books that have been stolen, but they've all been to sell, basically to sell them that is. People who come in coming with them. I've uh books

22:03.470 --> 22:10.779
stolen in England, offered for sale here, and I have on several occasions recognized that there's something wrong.

22:11.460 --> 22:27.199
If somebody comes in with a dozen books, eleven of which are other junk and one is a good one, I can believe that they found this in Salvation Army or they got it from my aunt or their grandfather or something like that.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.844
But if somebody comes in with twelve books and they're all terrific books,

22:32.090 --> 22:33.993
They didn't get them at the Salvation Army.

22:34.013 --> 22:36.316
They all have book plates taken off, too.

22:36.436 --> 22:39.640
They have book plates off or marks of ownership or something.

22:39.680 --> 22:44.787
At any rate, there have been cases where books have been stolen but then tried to be sold.

22:44.848 --> 22:53.880
However, Mr. Blumberg has had an income from his grandfather or someplace and has not had to sell anything.

22:53.900 --> 23:00.169
Now then, he probably did sell or exchange material if it improved his collection.

23:00.970 --> 23:01.911
Do you think that's the case?

23:02.161 --> 23:05.004
I think that's it.

23:05.024 --> 23:06.466
Had he ever been in here, do you know?

23:06.486 --> 23:12.333
Yes, the FBI showed me two receipts, one for $2 and one for $18 or something.

23:12.793 --> 23:31.915
So the strange thing is he kept all the receipts for a number of years as to every hamburger he bought, every motel, every phone call, every book, and possibly his defense is to prove

23:32.232 --> 23:35.217
he really bought these things, but he obviously didn't.

23:35.237 --> 23:38.062
Well, he kept the receipts, apparently, of every book that he stole, too.

23:38.142 --> 23:39.384
I mean, he kept the book plates.

23:39.404 --> 23:42.329
He took the things out of books and put them in stacks.

23:43.050 --> 23:50.723
Well, many of the things still have book plates and everything on them that he took out in wholesale lots.

23:51.044 --> 23:56.333
I mean, he just came in, I mean, I don't know if you know the Curtis Indians, which is

23:57.882 --> 24:01.467
I couldn't, in three loads, I couldn't carry it.

24:01.968 --> 24:03.951
Well, I mean, that's a lot of mysteries.

24:04.031 --> 24:08.738
I'd like to interview him and find out how he got some of these things out.

24:08.818 --> 24:27.045
However, I was told that he had some Minnesota or something booklet which he fabricated, and he would pose as a university professor and come in and do some work, and then he would

24:27.413 --> 24:36.764
take out a book plate, and I understand the one he took out he would eat to get rid of it, but then he would put this new phony book plate over it.

24:37.245 --> 24:56.728
And then when he would check out, probably late at night or a student on the watch or something, and they'd say, oh yes, check these books, they're mine, and they would look and here's this University of Minnesota Education Library or something book plate in there, and it would go out that way.

24:56.995 --> 25:04.987
The putting him with the book plates was partly a system of getting him out.

25:06.670 --> 25:14.241
However, he did have a couple of scrapbooks of sample book plates of 140 places or so that he appears to them.

25:14.261 --> 25:16.044
Did you see this?

25:16.064 --> 25:25.078
What was your, without betraying anything, and I'm aware of the limitations, okay, but I would just like your reaction when you saw this thing in its mask.

25:25.548 --> 25:29.632
Well, I'm just absolutely, audibly amazed.

25:29.752 --> 25:36.698
I mean, one of the big surprises was a member of the Samorano Club, a group of collectors here locally.

25:36.718 --> 25:38.319
What do we call the club?

25:38.479 --> 25:43.584
Samorano, that's the name for the first California printer.

25:44.164 --> 25:54.593
It's similar to the Grotier Club in New York, or the Roxborough Club in San Francisco, or the Rofant Club in Chicago, or the Jackson Club in New York.

25:54.792 --> 25:55.132
Right.

25:55.152 --> 25:55.793
Chicago.

25:56.334 --> 25:58.416
I mean, a similar sort of an organization.

25:58.476 --> 26:09.549
At any rate, I once made a survey of the Zamorano Club Library when it was at the University of Southern California and recommended that it be moved to another location.

26:09.569 --> 26:24.225
Well, before it was moved, Steve Bloomer got to it, and he took a hundred or so titles, not extremely valuable, but some very interesting

26:24.475 --> 26:54.246
things that people like Henry R. Wagner had given to the seminar club and so I and no one I didn't know in the numbers because I don't know if I didn't know that he had taken his books. That's one of the really interesting things about this whole case. I don't know what the current number is, 14000 15000 items whatever estimated low side 18000 the high side 28000. Totally half of them have not they don't even

26:54.445 --> 26:58.109
The people they were stolen from weren't even aware that they'd been stolen.

26:58.129 --> 27:10.304
Because they were mainly books that were rather specialized and kept in special collections, and they were not being used for reference very frequently.

27:10.324 --> 27:13.247
Were there any items of extreme value?

27:13.308 --> 27:14.229
Individual items?

27:14.249 --> 27:17.332
Or you say it's more valuable as a collection?

27:17.392 --> 27:19.575
I don't know about that.

27:20.045 --> 27:24.452
I mean, there's one of the most beautiful Nuremberg Chronicles I've ever seen.

27:24.472 --> 27:29.339
It's a $35,000 book or so.

27:29.439 --> 27:40.135
He liked Incunabula from several different libraries, but some of those, and the books were related to the Spanish Southwest.

27:40.295 --> 27:47.065
Cabeza de Vaca, for instance, an early edition of his first travel across the continent.

27:47.585 --> 28:07.634
a whole lot of really rare books, and he would have had opportunity to pick a lot of junk too, and there's some junk in the library, but for some reason there is no natural history or no science or no medicine to Mount, I think.

28:07.654 --> 28:15.685
It's mainly, actually, he would like to have followed in the footsteps of Thomas Streeter.

28:16.120 --> 28:24.968
to collect the same type of things, things relating to regional, local, national history of American history.

28:24.988 --> 28:28.452
So you do have a feel for his taste as a collector.

28:28.472 --> 28:33.696
And as a collection, let's forget for the moment that it's all stolen.

28:33.716 --> 28:36.439
As a collection, would you say he has very good taste as a collector?

28:36.459 --> 28:37.080
Yeah, of course.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.742
I personally do not like ex-library copies.

28:39.762 --> 28:45.047
I don't like books with perforations or rubber stamps or rebinds or things of that sort of soda.

28:45.517 --> 28:50.703
If you do your collecting in libraries, why, you're going to get it's all X library.

28:51.023 --> 28:55.168
And I like a book with a few exceptions.

28:56.510 --> 29:01.195
I prefer a book which is not been marked up by a library.

29:01.215 --> 29:09.805
Our mutual friend, Michael Zinman, will collect basically anything if it's like, in the old days, he would actually take anything.

29:09.825 --> 29:13.549
He would take crack copies, incomplete copies, which I think is

29:13.698 --> 29:43.553
he was going to do something on early Bibles or something. He showed me it looks pretty interesting. It's in progress. He says it's going to go for 8500 a pop. I said that's a lot of money and he said well they'll sell, they'll sell, and then we'll do a trade edition, but it's basically the first of everything in American Bibles. The first Bible done by a woman, first Bible done by an American Indian, first Bible and this and that and that and he owns all of these. Well in that case he can

29:44.005 --> 29:50.914
If he's going to smash him up, he can get a defective copy or an Alex Library copy.

29:50.935 --> 29:52.056
That doesn't matter.

29:52.076 --> 29:55.681
He's got three Eliot Bibles, too, which sort of like impresses.

29:55.701 --> 29:58.925
I think he's quite an interesting character.

29:59.126 --> 30:06.656
At any rate, Stephen Blumberg is sort of toward the end of my career here.

30:06.716 --> 30:13.185
Here is a collection I've had something to do with that if you're

30:13.587 --> 30:20.616
getting a postman and getting a criminal and getting a banker and getting a countess.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.440
Do you work with the countess?

30:24.460 --> 30:26.983
Yeah, we call her Mrs. D. I know she is, yeah.

30:27.003 --> 30:37.876
Well, one of my earliest bookselling recollections is delivering a book to her on Christmas Eve, and as a delivery boy I got a silver dollar.

30:37.896 --> 30:40.860
That was all the delivery boys got a silver dollar that day.

30:41.380 --> 31:02.771
Also, I can remember that when I went back to the holiday sale, normally she operated through Lucille Miller, who was her secretary and librarian, but she knew I was going back to the auction, so she called me personally and said she wanted the Zenus Leonard in the collection.

31:02.911 --> 31:07.438
She told me a story about how sometime she and her husband had

31:07.857 --> 31:09.518
missed something by very little.

31:09.839 --> 31:17.526
Anyway, gave me the indication that I was to buy that book, no matter what, which I did.

31:17.786 --> 31:20.108
Did you buy it at auction for her as well?

31:20.148 --> 31:22.250
I bought it for her at auction, yes.

31:22.270 --> 31:25.212
And did you have what they call a blank check to buy it?

31:25.393 --> 31:37.223
Well, really, there is no such thing as a blank check, because the bookseller has got to crack sometime that he just feels that

31:37.658 --> 31:43.886
In all honesty, he can't go up above a certain amount.

31:43.906 --> 31:47.090
But I did have pretty wide limits.

31:48.452 --> 31:49.553
Did she know her books?

31:50.555 --> 31:52.357
Oh yeah, she enjoyed them.

31:52.677 --> 31:56.843
It was a very eclectic collection, certainly.

31:56.863 --> 31:57.644
Yeah.

31:57.664 --> 32:05.674
It got started through my father here and then people like Korich and Meigs and Dr. Rosenbach and all that.

32:06.363 --> 32:18.660
I'll be spending a day at the Rosenbach, again, in a couple weeks, going through the doctor's correspondence with a number of collectors, and she's one of them.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.483
I'm very interested in it.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.247
You're going to be with the Rosenbach Foundation in Philadelphia?

32:23.267 --> 32:23.547
Yes.

32:24.629 --> 32:25.790
Very good question.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.154
The whole Rosenbach correspondence is there.

32:28.174 --> 32:34.783
Why don't you look around here a little bit and let me see if I can find a couple of things to show you at the documents.

32:35.472 --> 32:39.097
Thank you, sir.

32:39.117 --> 32:40.238
We're looking at the Doheny catalog.

32:40.258 --> 32:47.547
Well, I was looking at the street or sale where you'll find provenance of many books, but then this is the second part of the Doheny collection.

32:48.228 --> 32:56.779
And those are numbers there that... 141, 146, 167, 169.

32:57.379 --> 32:59.642
I have all these catalogs.

32:59.662 --> 33:05.209
And usually here again, they give the provenance of the book.

33:05.577 --> 33:16.871
And there's a... Well, that's for mags, for instance, and 45.

33:19.734 --> 33:30.007
That's the wrong one here.

33:30.027 --> 33:31.008
Let's see where am I?

33:31.048 --> 33:33.171
Well, you said 141, so try 141 and 146.

33:36.374 --> 33:37.856
Well, I don't see the problem.

33:37.956 --> 33:39.699
I said, here it is, here it is.

33:39.719 --> 33:42.162
Purchased by Countess Doheny from Dawson, 1950.

33:42.262 --> 33:45.086
That was my brother and I were in there.

33:45.547 --> 33:47.670
And I don't know the exact figures I could get.

33:47.710 --> 33:51.535
It was like $5,000 or so and sold for $100,000.

33:51.556 --> 33:58.766
And this Huntington Library considers the most important manuscript acquisitions since the time of Huntington.

33:58.786 --> 33:59.146
Really?

34:00.088 --> 34:00.388
Yeah.

34:00.448 --> 34:01.289
Who bought it?

34:01.349 --> 34:01.730
Huntington?

34:01.750 --> 34:02.551
No, Huntington bought it.

34:02.571 --> 34:04.714
They had a... At the Doheny sale?

34:04.734 --> 34:05.335
At the Doheny sale.

34:06.158 --> 34:13.207
And so I have a certain pride in the fact that I once owned that book, or at least I had it on commission.

34:13.227 --> 34:15.009
And the name of this book is?

34:15.670 --> 34:20.095
It's a manuscript of about 1140.

34:20.435 --> 34:21.236
Wow.

34:21.256 --> 34:25.341
So it's one of the great prizes out of the Huntington Library.

34:25.682 --> 34:33.391
Well, is this satisfaction for a bookseller if you don't even collect basically on a large scale yourself?

34:33.651 --> 34:35.794
But you must take pride in seeing

34:36.382 --> 34:38.485
and placing things in collections.

34:38.705 --> 34:49.097
And now you just mentioned that you have a lot of satisfaction in knowing that one of the great acquisitions for the Huntington is something that you acquired from Mrs. Doheny.

34:49.117 --> 34:50.859
I mean, is there satisfaction in that?

34:50.919 --> 34:51.941
I guess it's kind of what I'm saying.

34:52.081 --> 34:53.342
Yeah, well, here I'm going to give you this.

34:53.382 --> 34:58.028
There's my collection on early Los Angeles printing here.

34:58.689 --> 35:01.512
Oh, wonderful.

35:01.532 --> 35:04.836
And in 1967, I had a lot of

35:05.390 --> 35:30.302
bids, and I bought something I would have liked, but I had a bid from UCLA, and my obligation to my customer was greater than my personal thing, and so I did not buy it for $5,500, which I, well, actually, I could have gone for $5,500, but I bought it for $1,400.

35:30.843 --> 35:32.325
However, I did

35:32.609 --> 35:38.355
take delivery in New York at a prize, and I brought it home on the airplane with me, and I put it in my case.

35:38.916 --> 35:39.597
I'll get that, sir.

35:39.617 --> 35:40.257
Let me get that.

35:40.277 --> 35:41.018
Let me get that.

35:41.399 --> 35:46.544
I put it in my case of Los Angeles imprints for one night before I delivered it to UCLA.

35:46.724 --> 35:51.510
So I have the satisfaction of that book was in my collection for one night.

35:51.930 --> 35:52.210
That's nice.

35:52.230 --> 35:52.691
You got it, Chuck.

35:53.171 --> 35:54.213
That's nice.

35:54.233 --> 35:55.814
That's the Ho-Ho Volante there.

35:56.215 --> 36:01.080
This is a recent Ho-Ho Volante that I wrote an article here that

36:01.381 --> 36:28.452
about this uh this material. Here that's yours. This has been published twice on miniature books but I don't have a copy of the published version. And this is a very uh minor little thing but. It's all important. Excellent. Anything else you could tell me about Mrs. Dokini that I should know? Or Mr. Blumberg?

36:29.140 --> 36:32.766
Those are certainly two of the prime candidates.

36:33.387 --> 36:44.326
Do you know books by someone over in Arizona that wrote a book on the... There's one a Carl Cannon book on American Book Collectors.

36:44.346 --> 36:45.628
I have it.

36:45.669 --> 36:47.131
That's by Don Dickinson.

36:47.151 --> 36:50.797
The Cannons came first, and then Dickinson out of Arizona.

36:50.998 --> 36:51.739
Those two...

36:51.955 --> 36:55.459
The things there are basic hard facts.

36:55.479 --> 36:58.583
Yeah, I've talked to Dickinson as a matter of fact.

36:58.643 --> 37:01.086
He's actually doing a biography of Huntington now, you know.

37:01.927 --> 37:04.590
And I have a Huntington chapter where he comes up.

37:04.610 --> 37:06.692
I just did some research.

37:06.712 --> 37:09.035
And there's a little bit about the final sign.

37:09.055 --> 37:10.477
This is your 500th catalog?

37:10.497 --> 37:10.637
Yeah.

37:10.717 --> 37:12.079
Would you sign that for me?

37:12.099 --> 37:15.323
No kidding.

37:15.343 --> 37:16.444
That would be nice.

37:19.462 --> 37:25.889
Actually, this was, I've done a lot of catalogs.

37:25.949 --> 37:26.149
This is .

37:26.169 --> 37:37.402
It's your 500 catalog, and I'm Nick or Nicholas.

37:37.422 --> 37:44.810
Today's August 6th.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.752
Give this gal here a phone call.

37:47.322 --> 37:48.484
Emily Driscoll.

37:48.504 --> 38:07.488
She did not pay her dues, and so my brother is a president of the ADA, and I said, well, you can't drop her out, because she was on the original board with me on the founding of the ADA.

38:07.508 --> 38:09.912
She was one of the original directors.

38:10.252 --> 38:16.300
So we made her an 11th member, which she was entitled to.

38:16.583 --> 38:22.732
She can't see very well, and she has somebody, but she still buys the cell a little bit.

38:22.772 --> 38:30.103
But she must be in her 90s, so if you're looking, I don't know whether you or Sid Berger was looking for the oldest bookseller or not.

38:30.123 --> 38:31.906
Well, I think she might have some great stories.

38:32.327 --> 38:35.271
Well, she knew everybody.

38:35.291 --> 38:36.753
One other fast question.

38:37.955 --> 38:45.747
It has been said by a number of people that the book collecting game, shall we say, has kind of moved to the West Coast.

38:46.317 --> 38:49.702
that the action is out here?

38:49.722 --> 38:58.694
Oh, I think London and New York are still there.

38:58.754 --> 39:01.237
Still there.

39:01.257 --> 39:04.201
And I think Michael Zinion responded similarly when I put that question to him.

39:04.222 --> 39:06.945
A lot of people see, well, there are a lot of people who are collecting out here who kind of have what's said new money.

39:07.947 --> 39:13.354
But maybe it's a lot freer money and it's happier money and maybe they're more willing to

39:15.275 --> 39:34.904
Invested in, and I hate how to use the word invest, too, but spend it on collectibles.

39:35.064 --> 39:37.928
People can turn up anywhere with interest and money.

39:37.948 --> 39:38.369
That's a good answer.

39:38.389 --> 39:44.478
And just like I bought the books from Baker Parfer, he thought I'd sold them in Hollywood, and I sold them back to New York, you see, and we've had people from every part of the world coming here.

39:44.498 --> 39:44.758
That's crazy.

39:47.607 --> 39:48.471
I'm going to leave you.

39:48.491 --> 39:57.769
If you don't mind, that's the end of the Glen, G-L-E-N, Dawson, D-A-W-S-O-N interview.
