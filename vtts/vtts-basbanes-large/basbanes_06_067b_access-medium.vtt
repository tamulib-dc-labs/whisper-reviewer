WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.443
Oh, we're in the vault.

00:04.463 --> 00:05.084
We're in the vault.

00:06.526 --> 00:14.658
And the books in the vault are arranged the same way that the books in the stacks are, that is in Library of Congress classification order.

00:14.759 --> 00:24.874
So if you want, for example, to see our American literature that's down here, then we're going to the section of the PS's.

00:25.968 --> 00:28.892
I'm just passing by a first folio, though.

00:28.912 --> 00:29.312
That's right.

00:29.693 --> 00:32.957
Passing by a set of the four folios.

00:32.977 --> 00:34.359
Yeah, and they have the same bindings.

00:34.379 --> 00:34.960
That's right.

00:34.980 --> 00:37.924
But the four that sold at the garden last year had different bindings.

00:37.944 --> 00:39.626
Well, that's a little different bindings.

00:39.646 --> 00:40.867
That's kind of the same.

00:40.887 --> 00:43.411
Yeah, Mr. Lilly bought this in the 1930s.

00:43.431 --> 00:45.854
It's the first time I've touched a first folio.

00:45.874 --> 00:45.934
Oh.

00:46.201 --> 00:47.583
I've touched the Gutenberg Bible.

00:47.623 --> 00:51.929
I touched the Caxton and the Tamerlane, but that's my first first folio.

00:51.949 --> 00:53.891
Well, we have a Caxton and Tamerlane as well.

00:54.091 --> 00:55.153
You do have a Tamerlane.

00:55.473 --> 00:55.874
Yeah.

00:55.894 --> 00:56.595
Oh, good for you.

00:56.735 --> 00:58.758
Yeah, we do.

00:59.178 --> 01:01.041
We don't have one anywhere in New England.

01:01.061 --> 01:01.601
Did you know that?

01:01.902 --> 01:03.244
No, I didn't.

01:03.604 --> 01:05.507
Not at the American Antiquarian?

01:05.547 --> 01:06.608
No, not at Harvard.

01:07.549 --> 01:09.011
Go ahead.

01:09.031 --> 01:15.600
So this is all American literature with some inscribed Mark Twain's Tamerlane, a lot of

01:15.884 --> 01:16.645
Nice.

01:16.665 --> 01:18.047
Was that Mr. Lilly's Ulysses?

01:18.067 --> 01:19.810
I don't know.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.753
I wonder if he'd afforded Ulysses.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.160
Oh, look at the condition of that, huh?

01:26.180 --> 01:27.382
That's a beautiful condition.

01:27.402 --> 01:28.284
I mean, my God.

01:30.808 --> 01:31.729
I better want to fill it up.

01:31.749 --> 01:33.152
I'm going to write a few things down.

01:33.352 --> 01:35.475
I don't see Mr. Lilly's book.

01:35.535 --> 01:36.918
I've never seen a Ulysses.

01:37.358 --> 01:42.587
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:42.607 --> 01:43.528
Perfect condition.

01:45.618 --> 01:48.202
I don't know how they use any of the stuff in the store, but it's just that.

01:48.722 --> 01:49.263
I touched it.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.106
That was enough.

01:51.126 --> 01:53.749
And the first limited edition of T.E.

01:53.769 --> 01:53.970
Lawrence.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.133
Oh, that's a toughie, isn't it?

01:56.153 --> 01:56.453
Yeah.

01:56.473 --> 01:59.257
How do you decide what... Now, what have we got here?

01:59.317 --> 02:03.483
This is the first edition of Alice in Wonderland, the 1865 Alice.

02:04.224 --> 02:04.925
That's the tough one.

02:04.945 --> 02:07.629
That's the one he tried to destroy, right?

02:07.649 --> 02:07.969
That's right.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.954
And then the American, the 1866.

02:12.596 --> 02:13.197
And what else?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.038
We have a lot of...

02:14.407 --> 02:19.714
The first editions of Dickens, published in the original parts.

02:21.697 --> 02:24.981
Could you open up the... Shakespeare is pretty special to me.

02:25.322 --> 02:25.963
Yeah.

02:25.983 --> 02:28.306
Open up the first folio to the frontispiece.

02:28.346 --> 02:28.626
Sure.

02:30.509 --> 02:33.272
This will make my... I'm putting the pen away.

02:35.515 --> 02:35.876
I know.

02:36.096 --> 02:37.478
I've got... Oh, my goodness.

02:38.059 --> 02:40.903
May I hold this stuff down?

02:40.923 --> 02:43.146
Oh.

02:44.067 --> 02:44.127
Oh.

02:44.680 --> 02:49.406
It's really something.

02:49.426 --> 02:50.046
This is good.

02:50.347 --> 02:51.708
What's the provenance of this?

02:53.450 --> 02:55.793
It was a set.

02:55.813 --> 02:57.135
I'd have to look it up.

03:01.199 --> 03:01.920
I'll check it out.

03:02.561 --> 03:03.602
This is making my day.

03:03.622 --> 03:04.123
Don't worry about it.

03:04.143 --> 03:06.486
I was just going to see whether there were any book plates.

03:06.546 --> 03:07.567
I got it.

03:09.709 --> 03:10.510
I got it.

03:10.530 --> 03:11.852
What were your book plates?

03:12.862 --> 03:13.823
Oh, it is.

03:13.923 --> 03:14.884
Oh, there it is.

03:14.904 --> 03:15.926
Okay.

03:15.946 --> 03:16.847
I'm going to take out my pen.

03:17.047 --> 03:17.868
I don't know.

03:17.888 --> 03:18.569
It's way over here.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.982
Your caxton's in this room, too?

03:29.382 --> 03:30.423
Yeah, it's right down.

03:30.444 --> 03:34.649
Here's the caxton tosser, the 1477, and here's the caxton.

03:34.729 --> 03:36.070
Can I see one?

03:36.411 --> 03:36.591
Yeah.

03:38.765 --> 03:40.908
Really, really bought some wonderful thing.

03:41.008 --> 03:42.571
Oh, look at the condition of this!

03:42.831 --> 03:48.519
Yeah, well, it is racking a number of leaves at the front, so I love the prologue.

03:48.539 --> 03:50.222
This is a rebinding itself.

03:50.242 --> 03:51.263
Okay, but it's wooden wood.

03:51.604 --> 03:55.549
Yeah.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.312
Let me just fill the paper.

03:58.754 --> 04:00.236
And which Caxton is this?

04:00.256 --> 04:02.880
This is the first of the Canterbury Tales, the 1477.

04:04.002 --> 04:07.667
We also have the second edition published a few years later that's the first illustrated.

04:08.088 --> 04:08.248
Mm-hmm.

04:09.005 --> 04:14.873
Do you have any quartos?

04:15.373 --> 04:16.455
Any Shakespeare quartos?

04:16.835 --> 04:18.798
Yeah, Huntington has it.

04:18.978 --> 04:24.906
All we have is one of the false-dated quartos, the ones, let's say, 1600, but early 1619.

04:25.086 --> 04:29.291
Whew, that's exciting.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.654
And that's, which, Cameron, is that?

04:32.015 --> 04:34.999
It's a very early... 1481, obviously.

04:35.459 --> 04:38.303
And let's see, we've got some good stuff on the other side.

04:38.705 --> 04:46.075
This is the first American edition of the Audubon.

04:46.236 --> 04:49.740
This is a beautiful set in the original.

04:50.502 --> 04:58.172
I've already got my kick for the day.

04:58.192 --> 04:59.294
You have the elephant folio?

04:59.374 --> 05:00.956
Yeah, it's not down here, it's elsewhere.

05:01.056 --> 05:02.218
It's too big to take out.

05:03.780 --> 05:07.986
This is where a lot of the Bibles usually go, but they're in the

05:08.303 --> 05:11.006
Now, do you keep the Gutenberg on permanent display?

05:11.027 --> 05:11.587
Yes, we do.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.450
Is it a two-line Gutenberg?

05:13.470 --> 05:15.432
Unfortunately, all we have is the New Testament.

05:15.452 --> 05:18.676
We don't have the Old Testament.

05:20.038 --> 05:20.218
Oh.

05:20.238 --> 05:23.963
And here's the first of Homer in Greek, 1488.

05:23.983 --> 05:24.684
This is down here.

05:27.948 --> 05:31.593
This is Jefferson Davis' copy of the Constitution.

05:31.713 --> 05:32.034
Oh, ma'am.

05:32.995 --> 05:36.319
I held the first printing of the... of the...

05:37.328 --> 05:41.954
Constitution, which is owned by a private collector in Santa Barbara, Dave Karpolis.

05:41.994 --> 05:42.775
Have you ever heard of him?

05:42.795 --> 05:44.117
No, I haven't.

05:44.137 --> 05:45.338
He's a fascinating story.

05:45.358 --> 05:46.219
You'll see it in my book.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.944
Okay, we have one of the draft proofs, I guess.

05:49.964 --> 05:51.566
Yeah.

05:51.586 --> 05:54.730
It's Jefferson Davis' copy of the Constitution.

05:54.790 --> 05:55.090
Okay.

05:57.073 --> 06:06.745
And Samuel Pennypacker has written in this book, you know, about Jefferson Davis, his book, and little good did it do him.

06:07.163 --> 06:07.804
Do that again?

06:08.345 --> 06:09.446
This is the Pet Pennypacker.

06:09.466 --> 06:10.228
It was quite an important book.

06:10.248 --> 06:10.949
Yeah, you can read.

06:10.969 --> 06:21.244
Okay, this book, and little good did it do him, Samuel W. Pennypacker, April 27, 1895, and it is signed Jefferson Davis, 21st December, 1848.

06:21.264 --> 06:25.490
No, it has to be 18... Give me the date on that again?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.211
1848.

06:26.331 --> 06:26.511
Okay.

06:26.551 --> 06:27.232
Yeah.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.815
1848.

06:28.855 --> 06:34.403
Yeah, this is something...

06:34.619 --> 06:35.360
What is it now?

06:35.680 --> 06:37.783
It's an edition of the Constitution.

06:37.803 --> 06:38.524
Okay.

06:38.544 --> 06:39.425
Of the United States.

06:39.525 --> 06:39.866
I'm sorry.

06:39.886 --> 06:40.707
I thought we were handling it.

06:40.727 --> 06:42.630
No, we've got the Confederate Constitution.

06:42.650 --> 06:42.750
Okay.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.671
I was off on that.

06:44.552 --> 06:44.993
Okay.

06:47.556 --> 06:50.320
Well, that makes it a very, very, very, very interesting item.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.803
That's right.

06:52.823 --> 06:53.324
The U.S.

06:53.344 --> 06:53.945
1848.

06:54.105 --> 06:58.491
That's the 1846 edition of the Constitution.

06:58.511 --> 06:59.972
He signed it 1848.

07:00.273 --> 07:00.373
Yeah.

07:02.429 --> 07:13.106
And this is Thomas Jefferson's copy of the first printing of the Bill of Rights, which was printed as part of the acts passed to the Congress of the United States.

07:13.126 --> 07:14.028
How did you guys get that?

07:14.388 --> 07:15.350
The question is asked.

07:17.293 --> 07:20.198
It came from Mr. Lilly's collection again.

07:20.899 --> 07:27.009
And this is the transmittal letter from the President's office from George Washington.

07:27.029 --> 07:27.149
May I?

07:27.169 --> 07:27.549
I'll read it.

07:27.830 --> 07:27.930
Yeah.

07:28.535 --> 07:44.575
The President of the United States requests the Secretary of State to accept the enclosed volume of laws passed during the first session of the Congress of the United States, March 29th, 1790.

07:44.636 --> 07:48.841
And so Jefferson was Washington's Secretary of State.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.984
And so does Jefferson sign this anywhere?

07:51.404 --> 07:53.727
Well, he does in his own way.

07:54.068 --> 07:57.512
Jefferson marked his books in a particular...

07:58.235 --> 08:21.348
In signature I, since there was no J in lettering these signatures, he wrote a T in Thomas Jefferson, and he did the same thing in signature T. Well, it's held up pretty nicely, doesn't it?

08:21.368 --> 08:21.969
Oh, yeah, it has.

08:21.989 --> 08:22.850
Just a little yellow.

08:23.191 --> 08:23.812
Okay, I got you.

08:23.832 --> 08:25.494
So that is his T. That is his, yeah.

08:26.696 --> 08:27.617
And so this was bound.

08:27.935 --> 08:32.001
While he was Secretary of State.

08:34.284 --> 08:38.050
It's a treat.

08:38.310 --> 08:49.407
Today's like a frenzy of treasures.

08:50.389 --> 08:51.510
Douglas Debates.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.735
It's a presentation copy from Abraham Lincoln.

08:56.335 --> 08:59.499
It looks like we could have been bound, you know, 20 years ago, doesn't it?

08:59.519 --> 09:00.981
Well, again, these are all boxes.

09:01.982 --> 09:02.523
Okay.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.003
Can I see it?

09:05.206 --> 09:05.306
Yeah.

09:05.326 --> 09:06.648
Who did he present it to, I wonder?

09:17.322 --> 09:19.144
Steven Winchester.

09:19.925 --> 09:20.626
Is that in pencil?

09:20.806 --> 09:21.006
Uh-huh.

09:21.627 --> 09:22.048
Yeah?

09:22.068 --> 09:23.690
Yeah.

09:23.710 --> 09:24.831
And again, is this Mr. Lilly?

09:25.392 --> 09:26.173
That I don't know.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.635
Carol Edward Wilson.

09:28.655 --> 09:35.282
Carol A. Wilson, who's a noted... Again, magnificent condition.

09:38.606 --> 09:46.775
Oh, Lincoln Jefferson of Washington.

09:48.777 --> 09:51.861
So this is some of our Western Americana.

09:51.881 --> 09:56.346
This is the first edition of the...

09:59.043 --> 10:07.334
a published report of the Lewis and Clark expedition in the original boards.

10:07.354 --> 10:11.140
A history of the expedition and the command of Captains Lewis and Clark.

10:11.821 --> 10:13.082
This is such a rare item.

10:13.102 --> 10:14.945
1814.

10:27.562 --> 10:28.864
Do you enjoy coming in here?

10:29.232 --> 10:36.821
Oh, yes.

10:36.841 --> 10:41.227
I guess the decision on what comes in here is kind of a judgment call, right?

10:41.307 --> 10:41.567
Yeah.

10:41.607 --> 10:42.989
We know it when we see it.

10:43.409 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, and that's all Bill Cagle's decision.

10:52.020 --> 10:52.120
Yeah.

10:52.140 --> 10:57.687
Early Mexican and Japanese-related...

10:58.493 --> 10:59.955
First War and Peace.

10:59.975 --> 11:02.057
Is that in the Russian?

11:02.137 --> 11:02.718
Yes, it is.

11:05.001 --> 11:08.425
I have a number of important books.

11:08.445 --> 11:09.607
Probably signed by Felstead, right?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.450
That I would doubt.

11:12.470 --> 11:13.832
I would doubt.

11:13.852 --> 11:14.673
Let me see.

11:15.574 --> 11:16.295
Francis Bacon?

11:16.655 --> 11:20.720
Yeah, we have Francis Bacon.

11:20.740 --> 11:24.485
A lot of nice original bacon.

11:25.526 --> 11:26.948
This is...

11:27.940 --> 11:29.462
Isaac Newton, you know?

11:29.622 --> 11:30.082
Oh, yeah.

11:30.102 --> 11:37.250
We've got, uh, this is the first edition of the Principia.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.094
I do like the Principia.

11:44.018 --> 11:44.158
Yeah.

11:44.198 --> 11:50.365
Beautiful coffee and wonderful early vineyard.

11:50.385 --> 11:53.349
Wow.

11:53.369 --> 11:54.790
That's... That's Mr. Loeb.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.052
...Exlibris.

11:56.072 --> 11:56.412
Yeah.

11:56.898 --> 11:58.240
Kirby Lilly.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.403
Josiah Kirby Lilly.

12:00.643 --> 12:01.945
Josiah Kirby Lilly.

12:02.025 --> 12:02.846
Sorry about that.

12:02.866 --> 12:04.528
I've been up since 5 o'clock this morning.

12:04.548 --> 12:06.191
I don't have to forgive me.

12:06.211 --> 12:09.755
Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica.

12:10.376 --> 12:11.838
And what was the year on that?

12:11.858 --> 12:12.339
1687.

12:12.359 --> 12:13.100
1687.

12:13.380 --> 12:19.689
Not bad, huh?

12:19.709 --> 12:25.757
So we have a number of important sciences.

12:27.138 --> 12:33.084
The history of science and medicine was an area that Mr. Raleigh called.

12:33.124 --> 12:35.647
That would make sense, wouldn't it?

12:35.667 --> 12:36.207
Yeah.

12:36.267 --> 12:42.374
Here we have one of our most important, probably our most important binding.

12:42.394 --> 12:46.798
This is one of the... This would be my third boy.

12:48.180 --> 12:55.187
And, wow.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.872
Well, it's a Fort Siler, who I interviewed.

12:57.892 --> 12:59.294
You've heard of him down in Washington?

13:01.156 --> 13:01.596
Oh, yeah.

13:01.616 --> 13:03.618
Let me handle this.

13:03.638 --> 13:07.162
This has been on exhibit at the Grolier Club when they had it there.

13:07.622 --> 13:13.388
It's a big exhibition.

13:13.408 --> 13:13.688
Wow.

13:14.589 --> 13:19.074
So, as is the case in the other areas, things that are too large.

13:19.634 --> 13:21.016
I don't have to handle anything else.

13:21.236 --> 13:22.557
I've been satiated.

13:23.098 --> 13:24.499
You get the idea.

13:24.597 --> 13:27.040
We did one, two, we did ten.

13:27.681 --> 13:28.442
This is the record.

13:28.782 --> 13:33.308
Yeah, and there are also a number of manuscripts down here as well.

13:33.348 --> 13:35.190
Well, what would be really great?

13:35.270 --> 13:38.494
Well, that's something that you'd have to talk to the curator of manuscripts about.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.238
We're running out of time anyway.

13:42.639 --> 13:46.504
We do have, for example, George Washington's letter accepting the presidency.

13:47.007 --> 13:48.109
of the United States.

13:48.189 --> 13:49.411
That's just so bad.

13:49.831 --> 13:52.776
You wonder why something like that is not in the National Archives, don't you?

13:53.076 --> 14:07.639
Well, it was written to someone who, you know, and it descended, it was written to John Langdon, and it descended through John Langdon's family, and eventually was sold to the Lilly in the 1970s.

14:08.059 --> 14:09.201
That's very interesting.

14:10.244 --> 14:14.711
Yeah, that's how a guy out in California got the Confederate States of America Constitution.

14:14.911 --> 14:15.211
Really?

14:15.552 --> 14:20.199
It was in the Georgia State House for a hundred years until his people parents said, we need the money.

14:20.239 --> 14:21.561
We'd like our Constitution back.

14:21.581 --> 14:23.003
And he says, what are you, crazy?

14:23.023 --> 14:24.125
I said, look it up.

14:24.285 --> 14:25.046
Lo and behold.

14:25.327 --> 14:34.120
Well, it was just wonderful.

14:34.140 --> 14:34.520
Thank you.

14:36.804 --> 14:37.585
What a heck.

14:43.808 --> 14:47.612
Is there any questions you've got?

14:47.632 --> 14:48.653
I was just wrapping up.

14:48.693 --> 14:59.104
I'm going to go and purchase some documents, some things, and then I think I'll look at the exhibit and take a few photographs and head back to Chicago.

15:01.747 --> 15:05.370
This is the Lincoln Room, which houses a portion of our Lincoln collection.

15:05.991 --> 15:08.854
We're getting the exhibition cases

15:09.290 --> 15:18.044
Now, not related to Lincoln, it's a selection of Arabic manuscripts, because there's something going on on campus this month, and that's in connection.

15:18.064 --> 15:20.247
Do you have any catalogs in these things?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.790
Of these small exhibitions?

15:21.810 --> 15:22.030
No.

15:23.212 --> 15:34.890
No, we put in probably between 30 and 40 exhibitions each year, and only two or three of them get cataloged, but we do produce checklists for some of the smaller ones.

15:34.910 --> 15:36.613
This is a replica of something.

15:36.762 --> 15:40.146
Well, it's just a room decorated in the style of the American Southwest.

15:40.166 --> 15:49.717
This is called the Ellison Room, and houses a portion of the collection that was formed by Robert Ellison, whose portrait is up there.

15:50.498 --> 15:57.265
And the Lily 25th anniversary book tells about Ellison, but that's where we got a lot of our good Western Americana.

15:57.285 --> 15:58.627
And this was built for him?

15:59.127 --> 16:05.014
Well, he died in the 40s, and when the collection got moved over to the Lily in 1960,

16:05.332 --> 16:09.257
This room was specially built to house a part of it to be a memorial room.

16:09.317 --> 16:15.404
It's now also used as a classroom, because we have classes meeting frequently in the lily.

16:16.685 --> 16:20.450
This room right over here is called the Elizabeth Ball Room.

16:20.610 --> 16:21.651
Elizabeth Ball was who?

16:22.132 --> 16:31.142
She was of the Ball Family of Mercy, Indiana, with ball canning jars and so forth, and she collected historical children's books.

16:31.262 --> 16:34.166
She was a collector?

16:34.186 --> 16:34.326
Mm-hmm.

16:34.694 --> 16:38.398
her collection of some eight to ten thousand children's books in 1983.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.139
Phyllis Ball.

16:40.359 --> 16:41.601
Elizabeth Ball.

16:42.201 --> 16:42.702
I'm sorry.

16:42.742 --> 16:49.348
I was looking at Phyllis Wheatley and you know how that happens, right?

16:49.368 --> 16:49.888
I'm sorry.

16:50.289 --> 16:53.031
It's Elizabeth with an S. Elizabeth.

16:53.332 --> 16:55.173
What was her little?

16:56.194 --> 16:57.055
Elizabeth Ball.

16:58.036 --> 17:00.298
Collector of, what was her special?

17:00.518 --> 17:01.219
Children's books.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.220
Okay.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.162
And again, there's a chapter on children's literature.

17:06.263 --> 17:07.303
And she's in there?

17:07.323 --> 17:08.144
She's in there, yeah.

17:08.324 --> 17:08.725
Okay.

17:09.766 --> 17:19.974
Really small women feel like there's a heart to come by, as you probably know, right?

17:19.994 --> 17:20.094
Yeah.

17:20.114 --> 17:20.214
Okay.

17:20.234 --> 17:23.337
There are just a couple more rooms that are normally locked upstairs.

17:23.357 --> 17:25.539
If you want, I can show you better.

17:25.659 --> 17:26.580
You got the time?

17:26.840 --> 17:28.221
Yeah.

17:28.241 --> 17:30.683
I know, I'm coming back here again.

17:30.703 --> 17:32.545
But we haven't put the label again.

17:34.212 --> 17:37.216
Right here, this came from Mr. Lilly as well.

17:43.223 --> 17:43.743
Moyer?

17:45.926 --> 17:46.467
Sir Peter.

17:47.648 --> 17:48.229
I don't know why.

17:48.249 --> 17:49.430
Must be an ancestor, right?

17:49.790 --> 17:50.591
George Sand.

17:51.312 --> 17:53.935
Samuel Pepys, whose library I visited in Cambridge.

17:56.358 --> 17:56.559
Very nice.

17:56.579 --> 17:57.600
Handled his diary.

18:00.663 --> 18:00.764
Oh.

18:00.784 --> 18:02.025
Entering the Woodsworth Room.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.840
This is a very substantial structure, isn't it?

18:05.860 --> 18:06.200
Yes, it is.

18:07.001 --> 18:18.775
This is used for small seminars, and it also holds a portion of our collection of books related to William Wordsworth.

18:18.795 --> 18:21.699
Any manuscript stuff on Wordsworth?

18:21.779 --> 18:22.520
We do have some.

18:22.540 --> 18:24.202
They're not kept in its room.

18:24.302 --> 18:24.883
We have some.

18:25.544 --> 18:28.367
Wordsworth bust is

18:28.786 --> 18:34.234
also very important one that was the one that Wordsworth really liked and all that.

18:34.295 --> 18:42.067
We sent that to the New York Public Library traveling Wordsworth in the exhibition a couple of years ago.

18:42.107 --> 18:45.091
For the Fort Siler, Shelley and the Sheikho.

18:45.111 --> 18:48.236
Yeah, it was a big book, Wordsworth and the Age of Romance.

18:48.937 --> 18:50.920
There must be stuff from the Fort Siler.

18:51.061 --> 18:53.865
Well, there was a little bit, but there was a lot of stuff from England.

18:55.094 --> 18:57.256
This is the Mendel, M-E-N-D-E-L room?

18:57.497 --> 18:57.917
Mendel.

18:58.298 --> 18:58.958
Mendel?

18:58.978 --> 18:59.299
Yeah.

18:59.859 --> 19:01.061
Oh, this is beautiful, isn't it?

19:01.081 --> 19:05.045
Yeah, Mr. Mendel was a collector and dealer for a while.

19:05.085 --> 19:12.013
He also, he owned in the 1950s and 60s, he owned the firm of Lathrop Harper.

19:12.293 --> 19:12.593
Oh, really?

19:12.613 --> 19:13.735
In New York, yeah.

19:13.775 --> 19:20.863
Renato Mendel, M-E-N-D-E-L, bookman extraordinaire, 1895, 1967.

19:21.003 --> 19:22.244
That's right.

19:22.264 --> 19:23.886
Is that a publication you published?

19:24.575 --> 19:26.337
I'd probably purchase a copy of that one.

19:26.357 --> 19:28.199
I don't think that's out there, but I can get you a copy.

19:28.219 --> 19:29.040
Can you?

19:30.221 --> 19:33.264
I need as many things as I can get, by the way.

19:33.424 --> 19:34.425
Well, look at the books.

19:35.987 --> 19:36.407
Gorgeous.

19:36.487 --> 19:38.550
Now, he collected some bindings currently.

19:38.810 --> 19:46.017
Well, he collected books related to the history of Latin America, as well as early voyages and travels.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.159
That's where we got our atlases.

19:47.239 --> 19:49.221
Our Ptolemies came from Mendel.

19:49.902 --> 19:53.265
But the Mendel collection, as we received it,

19:53.903 --> 19:57.548
consisted of about 40,000 books and 26,000 manuscripts.

19:57.669 --> 19:58.289
Wow.

19:58.309 --> 19:59.531
This was a gift or a purchase?

19:59.551 --> 20:00.252
That was a purchase.

20:00.312 --> 20:05.039
And then there were gifts as well, but a lot of it was purchased.

20:05.059 --> 20:05.881
While he was alive?

20:06.762 --> 20:07.022
Yes.

20:07.743 --> 20:16.877
And then after his death, his widow donated the capital stock of Laker of Harper to the university.

20:16.957 --> 20:23.286
And so for a while, Indiana University was the official owner of Laker of Harper.

20:23.536 --> 20:27.523
What's in this room is probably about 5% of the Mendel Collection at most.

20:28.144 --> 20:35.396
But this is now used as an office for Dr. Cecil Bird, who was the first head of Special Collections at IU in the 1940s.

20:36.057 --> 20:41.866
And he's kind of an emeritus type of a... Yeah, and he comes in and works on exhibitions for us.

20:41.906 --> 20:46.254
He's got one on the California Gold Rush that's going in next year.

20:46.274 --> 20:50.100
It's taken largely from the Allison Collection.

20:51.211 --> 20:52.352
That must be Mrs. Mendel.

20:52.873 --> 20:55.196
Mrs. Mendel still lives in Bloomington.

20:55.636 --> 20:56.237
Really?

20:57.318 --> 20:57.619
Yeah.

20:57.639 --> 20:59.941
Oh, so they lived in Bloomington?

21:00.922 --> 21:02.164
Is this how we made the connection?

21:02.384 --> 21:09.773
No, they visited Bloomington frequently, and then I think, you know, they would be in Bloomington for part of the year and New York for part of the year.

21:10.033 --> 21:11.775
So they kind of followed the collection?

21:11.795 --> 21:13.017
The collection, right.

21:13.037 --> 21:15.059
Now again, that's a cute little... Yeah.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.224
And so this is another exhibit area.

21:19.464 --> 21:20.205
Is this the...

21:21.063 --> 21:22.584
Is this the portrait of Peeps?

21:23.405 --> 21:25.767
The one that's on his book plate?

21:25.907 --> 21:26.548
I don't know.

21:26.568 --> 21:29.191
I wonder if that's the original painting.

21:30.952 --> 21:31.573
That's the picture.

21:31.653 --> 21:34.275
He basically used his book plate.

21:35.436 --> 21:37.478
That's the overview.

21:42.763 --> 21:43.224
Terrific.

21:43.944 --> 21:45.446
So you were at the Newberry yesterday?

21:46.026 --> 21:47.167
I did a little work at the Newberry.

21:47.187 --> 21:49.129
I was there for two days, actually.

21:49.666 --> 21:52.200
research.
