WEBVTT

00:02.512 --> 00:05.596
Tracking Sir Donald Riggs, E. Riggs.

00:05.637 --> 00:06.678
What's your title now?

00:06.958 --> 00:08.541
I'm the Dean of the University Library.

00:08.861 --> 00:09.102
Uh-huh.

00:10.123 --> 00:15.611
And you've had a couple of things that you've done here, right?

00:16.733 --> 00:19.497
Are you moving to another position, I guess?

00:20.358 --> 00:24.204
I'm going over to the School of Information in January.

00:25.005 --> 00:25.906
I've been here six years.

00:27.348 --> 00:30.813
This is the first job, except for one, and I've stayed more than five years.

00:31.014 --> 00:31.354
Really?

00:31.537 --> 00:32.979
Yeah.

00:33.580 --> 00:41.071
At Arizona State where we built five new libraries and added 112 new positions, I stayed 11 and a half years.

00:41.571 --> 00:44.916
But could you tell me a little bit about what the new duties will involve?

00:45.237 --> 00:54.710
Well, I will be teaching courses in library leadership and academic libraries and advanced management.

00:56.172 --> 01:00.919
How do you feel about, I mean, it is kind of a, of course Michigan is

01:01.692 --> 01:04.155
considered one of the innovators, right?

01:04.375 --> 01:09.462
This digital library and stuff.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.724
How do you feel about that?

01:11.064 --> 01:14.649
Let's just start over the very general entry.

01:15.169 --> 01:20.016
Well, we have the, this library has one of the better collections in many areas.

01:20.116 --> 01:20.877
Collections of what?

01:21.037 --> 01:23.160
Well, for example, research collections.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.783
We have the best mathematics collection.

01:25.803 --> 01:29.328
We have the best dentistry, academic dentistry library collection.

01:30.209 --> 01:30.990
We have one of the better

01:31.274 --> 01:32.255
Faulkner collections.

01:35.097 --> 01:36.238
And we have, right Toby?

01:37.780 --> 01:39.881
Our Japanese collection is about the second best.

01:41.183 --> 01:53.093
So when I came here, one of the things I wanted to do was create an environment whereby we could take a leadership role in digitizing library materials and also work with corporations.

01:53.233 --> 01:57.056
And for example, we're working with the Mellon Foundation.

01:58.097 --> 02:00.319
We're digitizing ten

02:01.058 --> 02:05.543
social science, well, 10 history and economics journals from 1990 all the way back.

02:05.844 --> 02:14.194
And Bill Bowen, who used to be the president of the Princeton University, and has taken a very keen interest in this area.

02:14.214 --> 02:16.657
So, we're doing that work here at Michigan.

02:16.677 --> 02:17.458
Right.

02:17.478 --> 02:19.620
And, um, we're going.

02:20.161 --> 02:21.443
Go ahead.

02:21.463 --> 02:30.053
We're working with, on this sheet, with the Cornell University and digitizing about 5,000

02:30.607 --> 02:38.763
volumes of classics between 1850 and 1950, those items which are no longer protected by copyright.

02:39.044 --> 02:39.785
Right.

02:39.805 --> 02:42.270
So I was telling you, Kobe, copyright is the key.

02:42.611 --> 02:43.132
Exactly.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.917
Kobe said, why are they picking such and such a date?

02:45.957 --> 02:48.362
I said, I don't know, but my sense is,

02:48.764 --> 02:51.987
There's no copyright problem there.

02:52.528 --> 02:52.828
That's right.

02:52.848 --> 02:55.411
No, I was out at Cornell two weeks ago, so two days there.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.713
So you sold it, probably, at some of it.

02:57.913 --> 02:58.954
I sold a lot of it.

02:58.974 --> 03:02.117
I've been to Stanford and the Waterloo Congress.

03:02.377 --> 03:13.528
I've been to Corvus out in Washington State, so I'm, you know, I'm not... And, of course, everywhere you go, you hear Michigan, and you talk about digitizing books.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.210
Now, at Cornell,

03:15.477 --> 03:19.543
For instance, some of the things they digitize, they then deaccession and get rid of.

03:20.704 --> 03:24.510
What do you people do with things that you digitize?

03:24.550 --> 03:26.272
We haven't gotten rid of anything yet.

03:28.155 --> 03:35.164
Those ten journals which we're sending down to Barbados, actually, to have a digit scan because of the labor.

03:35.405 --> 03:40.211
However, the Mellon Foundation is paying more than the prevailing wage, and Bill Bowen has been challenged on it.

03:40.232 --> 03:41.894
Are you exploiting people in Barbados?

03:42.154 --> 03:42.655
Are they kidding?

03:43.256 --> 03:43.476
I'm sorry.

03:43.996 --> 03:45.538
No, they're not.

03:45.799 --> 03:47.341
No, they're not children.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.603
They're working as equipment.

03:48.843 --> 03:49.164
Right.

03:50.746 --> 03:54.171
So, we have to tear those journals apart, and here's something.

03:54.191 --> 04:01.783
For example, we may only have one copy of the journal, but a place like Harvard may have ten copies of that same title, full background.

04:02.163 --> 04:05.769
So, when we bring it back, we re-bind it.

04:05.809 --> 04:06.269
You do.

04:06.410 --> 04:06.830
Yeah, we do.

04:07.111 --> 04:12.619
At Cornell, when they break them up, I mean, they're going off to

04:13.190 --> 04:14.892
parks unknown, probably the landfill.

04:14.932 --> 04:16.674
I mean, you're aware of that.

04:17.675 --> 04:17.996
Yeah.

04:18.236 --> 04:19.618
What do you think?

04:19.638 --> 04:22.261
Should we keep both?

04:22.781 --> 04:26.285
I think publishers are going to... I don't have a position on this, by the way.

04:26.345 --> 04:31.451
I'm just really interested in, you know, what your attitude is on this.

04:32.633 --> 04:37.599
I think for a while we will probably keep the paper copy as well, Steve.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.184
But eventually we're going to, for example, for our card catalog,

04:42.468 --> 04:46.473
You know, many universities just threw them out, and that person wrote the article for the New Yorker.

04:47.033 --> 04:47.794
Nicholson Baker.

04:47.874 --> 04:48.575
Thank you.

04:48.595 --> 04:49.356
Yeah, I couldn't think of his name.

04:49.596 --> 04:51.919
But when I came, I told myâ€”we had not filed any cards.

04:51.979 --> 04:53.000
I came here in 1991.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.644
We had not filed any cards in the card catalog since 1989 or so.

04:57.045 --> 05:03.792
And I told my faculty group, I'm going to move that card catalog out so we can develop this Knowledge Navigation Center.

05:03.812 --> 05:07.176
And they said, well, give us a couple more years, and so on and so forth.

05:07.780 --> 05:12.267
We moved it down in the basement, took it out of that primary real estate, and we still have our card catalog.

05:12.328 --> 05:14.311
Not one peep out of the faculty here.

05:15.032 --> 05:16.715
That's what they were saying.

05:16.735 --> 05:26.692
They said, some faculty member said, you know, all of my material, most of my material is reflected in the card catalog, and it's not new material, so it won't be online.

05:27.112 --> 05:31.780
I said, well, it will be, but they said, well, we can still access it better, and so on and so forth.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.520
Will we keep the card catalog forever?

05:34.581 --> 05:35.582
I don't think so, Toby.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.565
Well, that happens.

05:37.585 --> 05:38.627
As long as I'm alive.

05:39.749 --> 05:40.951
Well, you have to.

05:41.271 --> 05:41.932
Thanks very much.

05:42.032 --> 05:43.234
As long as I'm alive.

05:43.294 --> 05:43.895
Now, there's a brand new one.

05:43.915 --> 05:44.737
Do you want to call him?

05:45.037 --> 05:46.379
Do you want me to call him now?

05:46.399 --> 05:46.700
Could you?

05:46.740 --> 05:48.543
Maybe you could do that, but then I could, yeah.

05:48.563 --> 05:53.511
And just tell him, I'm asking Stephen to come up here while Toby's here, and we've got this Brodsky collection.

05:53.691 --> 05:57.437
Just here, a little while ago, the story on the Robert Brodsky.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.138
This guy was?

05:58.158 --> 05:58.419
Yeah.

05:59.220 --> 06:00.482
He's missing.

06:00.502 --> 06:00.602
Well,

06:01.038 --> 06:02.220
I'll give him a call.

06:02.240 --> 06:02.340
Okay.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.642
How long are you going to be here, Toby?

06:04.202 --> 06:07.106
Until I leave.

06:07.427 --> 06:15.538
Toby will be back on Monday the 2nd of December.

06:15.558 --> 06:23.769
One of the reasons we are making things happen here as compared with some other universities is the fact that I discovered we couldn't go on this alone.

06:23.789 --> 06:25.712
We don't have the expertise in the library.

06:26.182 --> 06:32.810
So when Elsevier came out with their TULIP project, that's where they took material science journals and put it online.

06:33.091 --> 06:34.873
There were nine universities, I think, involved.

06:35.173 --> 06:44.965
We were able to get the project done faster than the other ones because we engage other people on campus, like our School of Engineering.

06:46.007 --> 06:55.058
And I have one person we lost to the University of Virginia, John Price Wilkins, who is probably the best in the country in the Humanities Tax Initiative.

06:56.101 --> 06:58.224
Anyway, John went down to Charlottesville.

06:58.244 --> 07:03.630
He didn't like it there, and Yale offered him a job, and so I wanted him back here.

07:03.650 --> 07:04.972
I didn't want him to leave in the first place.

07:05.152 --> 07:16.126
Anyway, so I called the dean of the arts and sciences, the director of University Press, and the dean of the library school, and I asked each other, can you give me fifteen thousand dollars to pay toward John's salary?

07:16.166 --> 07:17.728
They'd like if the library didn't come up that much.

07:17.768 --> 07:19.510
And they all said, we'd be happy to do this.

07:19.861 --> 07:22.705
So we're using other people's mothers in a sense.

07:22.906 --> 07:38.870
And this person who you met here a few minutes ago, Wendy Roger, she's employed as our Assistant Director for Digital Library Initiatives, which she's employed, her salary's paid 40% by library, 40% by information technology, and 20% by the School of Information.

07:39.471 --> 07:44.739
So we're using a kind of a, I suppose, a collaborative effort here on campus.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.083
And that's how we're making some of these things happen,

07:47.603 --> 07:51.988
University libraries really don't, on their existing staffs, do not have the expertise.

07:52.008 --> 07:53.831
We need to make these things move.

07:53.851 --> 07:56.714
Now, Cornell was, I couldn't believe how set up they are.

07:56.814 --> 07:57.035
Yeah.

07:57.255 --> 08:12.494
Now, the assistant librarian there, I can't think of his name right now, not Sarah, but the man just immediately beneath her, he said that they have been mandated by their trustees to limit, as of the year 2000, five million books.

08:12.734 --> 08:13.375
Have you heard that?

08:14.722 --> 08:15.723
And that's it.

08:15.883 --> 08:17.425
No more on a campus.

08:18.186 --> 08:20.810
Outrage.

08:22.772 --> 08:23.373
Burn the books.

08:25.336 --> 08:26.797
Undoubtedly, there is pressure.

08:27.278 --> 08:28.680
What are we going to do with all this stuff?

08:28.820 --> 08:30.142
We've got this great technology.

08:30.182 --> 08:30.923
We can scan it.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.286
Who needs the printed book?

08:33.366 --> 08:34.467
It was interesting.

08:34.507 --> 08:41.697
My provost told me, I said, we have 1.6 million volumes in storage, which we can get within 24 hours.

08:42.197 --> 08:42.838
Where do you keep them?

08:43.122 --> 08:44.143
about a mile from here.

08:44.443 --> 08:48.147
What do you call that facility?

08:48.167 --> 08:49.268
Is it just part of the library?

08:49.448 --> 08:53.232
It's called the BUHR, B-U-H-R, that's the name of the building.

08:53.392 --> 08:54.253
BUHR.

08:54.313 --> 08:59.658
I've been to the Harvard Depository, which is about 20 miles out of Cambridge.

08:59.938 --> 09:02.681
Yeah, but this is just down the road, down in Green Street.

09:03.482 --> 09:09.988
Well, we have 1.6 million volumes there, and the provost asked me, when I told him, I said, Bernie, we need more.

09:10.128 --> 09:13.011
We have to expand that area, because

09:13.345 --> 09:17.391
It's my understanding, we have one of the largest acquisitions budgets here.

09:17.591 --> 09:24.200
But since I've been here, I've really pushed that because we also buy our non-print materials out of that, the multimedia resources.

09:24.741 --> 09:32.492
So last year, the University of Michigan got the largest increase of any major research university library in the United States and Canada.

09:32.612 --> 09:33.013
Is that right?

09:33.033 --> 09:33.273
9.1%.

09:33.514 --> 09:35.176
I can show you this.

09:35.196 --> 09:35.757
What's the number?

09:35.777 --> 09:39.122
How much money did you have to spend on acquisitions?

09:39.142 --> 09:40.163
Last year we had...

09:40.548 --> 09:41.949
about $11 million.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.291
This year we'll be going over $12 million.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.092
Really?

09:45.132 --> 09:45.412
Yeah.

09:45.833 --> 09:46.934
That's for the whole university.

09:47.114 --> 09:57.803
Also, last yearâ€”I can show you statistics, thoughâ€”that last year the University of Michigan Library spent more for journals than any other university, including Harvard and Yale and all those.

09:58.304 --> 10:02.187
This university, since I've been here, when I came our budget was $19 million.

10:02.387 --> 10:04.209
Now it's $27 million.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.692
So we've addedâ€”and a lot of that's in the accuracy.

10:07.712 --> 10:09.053
I've heard a lot of them resign this year.

10:09.252 --> 10:11.535
And we've got an 8-point this past year.

10:11.555 --> 10:18.426
Well, when we got the 9.1%, the average was something like 3% among research libraries.

10:18.546 --> 10:24.335
And, of course, how do you break that down in terms of, you say, the multimedia stuff has kind of folded into that.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.598
What percentage goes to multimedia?

10:26.618 --> 10:33.388
Yeah, we're up to about, we're up to about, this doesn't sound much, but it's much when you compare federal libraries, about 7% now.

10:33.468 --> 10:33.749
Seven.

10:34.149 --> 10:35.031
Seven percent.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.234
Seven percent of that figure is for...

10:37.670 --> 10:38.311
Non-print.

10:38.491 --> 10:39.532
Non-print things?

10:39.633 --> 10:41.415
Well, I would have expected it to be more than that.

10:41.675 --> 10:41.935
Really?

10:41.955 --> 10:46.381
Yeah, but see, there's no university library is spending, say, ten percent.

10:46.401 --> 10:46.702
Yeah.

10:46.722 --> 10:49.445
And most, I was in a conference... So yours is less, actually.

10:49.505 --> 10:52.809
The lower percentage than most... No, ours is more.

10:52.970 --> 10:53.250
Really?

10:53.490 --> 10:54.552
Yeah.

10:54.572 --> 10:57.075
It's closer to four, four percent.

10:57.095 --> 10:58.817
And some people are not buying any

10:59.135 --> 11:05.906
CD-ROMs and, you know, database, electronic databases out of their budget, out of their materials.

11:06.006 --> 11:08.931
They try to get supplemental funding, but it's only like one time.

11:09.432 --> 11:12.317
We're trying to build it into our base, and administration has it.

11:12.517 --> 11:14.420
Part of the whole project.

11:15.362 --> 11:18.187
We have this one project, this Humanities Tech Initiative.

11:18.207 --> 11:21.292
Let me tell you just how the machine has helped scholarship.

11:21.312 --> 11:24.417
We use a software engine called Pat Lecter.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.891
P-A-T-L-E-C-L-E-C-T-O-R.

11:28.171 --> 11:29.372
It's a hyphenated word?

11:29.632 --> 11:30.953
Yeah, out of the University of Waterloo.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.916
And a professor was showing this one day.

11:34.116 --> 11:38.660
And he was saying, he used four words.

11:38.700 --> 11:43.945
He said, you know, I'm looking to see how many times these four words are connected or strung together.

11:44.025 --> 11:46.407
And the four words are like, in the search of.

11:46.427 --> 11:46.987
Rather simple.

11:47.908 --> 11:52.392
So he sits there, and there are 3,000 old English texts.

11:53.693 --> 11:54.454
1770.

11:54.957 --> 11:56.579
because the machinist did it.

11:56.979 --> 11:59.201
Another part would say, so what, you know?

11:59.221 --> 12:01.243
But I said, is this really important?

12:01.343 --> 12:03.225
But see, that's information, what we talked about again.

12:03.245 --> 12:04.086
That's concordance.

12:04.106 --> 12:06.468
Yeah, and here's what he... Well, you link concordance.

12:06.488 --> 12:06.589
Yeah.

12:06.609 --> 12:08.510
It's one word, right?

12:08.531 --> 12:08.931
Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:09.471 --> 12:16.879
But see, what he was saying, he was saying, for people who study linguistics, that's important, to have those words, I mean, you know.

12:17.139 --> 12:21.884
And I said, but how many... I said, just roughly, what would have taken you, you know, to do it manually?

12:21.904 --> 12:23.125
He said, 17 years.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.479
And if you think about that, that's quite an impact on scholarship.

12:26.142 --> 12:33.311
I don't want to belittle the importance of that, but it's kind of... Well, no, but when we talk about the information age, this is information.

12:33.472 --> 12:33.773
Yes.

12:34.259 --> 12:35.200
Not knowledge.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.121
It's not knowledge.

12:36.261 --> 12:36.461
Right.

12:36.481 --> 12:37.062
It's data.

12:37.082 --> 12:37.782
It's information.

12:37.822 --> 12:39.864
And it's extraordinarily useful.

12:40.004 --> 12:45.709
And I'd be a fool and a hypocrite and say I don't use it myself every day of the year because I do.

12:45.870 --> 12:46.170
That's right.

12:46.190 --> 12:49.673
When I'm asking you for your website, I say I'll do this at home.

12:49.793 --> 12:50.334
Oh, yes.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.935
Why waste valuable time here?

12:52.135 --> 12:54.057
Except you won't be able to do it.

12:54.077 --> 12:54.678
I think you will.

12:54.718 --> 12:55.238
I can do it.

12:55.819 --> 12:56.139
Pretty good.

12:56.279 --> 12:57.800
You might be shocked to learn, Toby.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.583
You're a great computer literate.

13:00.863 --> 13:01.504
You have to be.

13:01.524 --> 13:01.884
Oh, yeah.

13:01.904 --> 13:02.865
You have to be today.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.676
See, this is where the students know more.

13:05.916 --> 13:15.247
At one time, professors could stand up before their students and display their knowledge and all the great classics and, you know, all the great books and all the erotic articles.

13:15.627 --> 13:19.772
Now, these studentsâ€”the professor said, the students know more than I do, what's on the web.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.354
Isn't that interesting?

13:21.374 --> 13:21.874
Well, I know that.

13:21.894 --> 13:26.980
So, this is where the librarians are going to have to work hard and work with the faculty to get them up to speed, so to speak.

13:27.567 --> 13:35.955
This is, you know, a softball pitch, but what is a librarian's function historically and today, in your view?

13:35.976 --> 13:37.877
It's called information now.

13:37.897 --> 13:41.902
Did you notice the School of Libraries is now called School of Information?

13:41.922 --> 13:52.332
The role of the librarian has been, it's been a multi-role, identifying and ordering, organizing, articulating collections.

13:53.814 --> 13:57.237
Now, the role of the librarian, it still involves that.

13:57.622 --> 14:12.741
librarian serves as a navigator, someone, the navigator for online resources, someone who can, who can identify and seek out and locate and customize information online, you know, for the, for the user.

14:14.744 --> 14:19.130
Before digital, before the digital environment, we would have bibliographic resources.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.371
You can get the author and title.

14:20.752 --> 14:23.896
Now, you can bring that information right to the user's workstation.

14:24.537 --> 14:27.240
And see, I go, I go throughout the country and get speeches on

14:27.845 --> 14:32.090
on universal access to materials andâ€” Is this a specialty of yours?

14:32.851 --> 14:32.991
Mm-hmm.

14:33.011 --> 14:36.756
Nationalâ€”I was just inâ€”I missed Toby's conference.

14:36.796 --> 14:37.957
I was in Prague.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.299
I gave two speeches over there.

14:39.419 --> 14:43.664
One was on human values and theâ€”and cyberspace.

14:44.305 --> 14:45.407
You got a copy of that?

14:46.107 --> 14:49.031
I don't think I have one here, but I can see you.

14:49.051 --> 14:49.391
Would you?

14:49.492 --> 14:50.092
Yeah.

14:50.112 --> 14:52.435
And my otherâ€” I'll just have toâ€”I left my cards in my briefcase.

14:52.455 --> 14:57.261
And my otherâ€”my other talk was onâ€”

14:58.456 --> 15:07.465
universal access, a digital library, let's not forget the have-nots.

15:08.966 --> 15:12.990
Do you know two, one half of the world's population lives two miles from near his telephone?

15:13.871 --> 15:14.271
Think of it.

15:15.752 --> 15:18.435
One half of the world's population lives two miles from near his telephone.

15:19.116 --> 15:19.576
Think of this.

15:19.596 --> 15:25.982
25% of the public school children who are attending

15:26.182 --> 15:31.046
public schools in the city of Chicago come from homes without telephones.

15:31.287 --> 15:35.130
Now, talking about haves and have-nots, but it's not just a money issue.

15:35.190 --> 15:39.474
In some countries, for example... How many of them are going to have computers, then?

15:39.995 --> 15:46.040
Well, yeah, if they don't have... Maybe the book is more suited for people who are the have-nots.

15:47.061 --> 15:54.788
Maybe this technology does exclude a major... Well, I think, as a matter of fact, it might be one of the most serious problems in our

15:55.207 --> 16:04.380
Civilization, in the future, if you think about my, you know, because the people have access to all this information, it's going to be much farther ahead, I think, and those two do not.

16:05.161 --> 16:11.891
And, but there are other, it's just, I mean, sure, money's one issue, but there are many other issues, too.

16:12.512 --> 16:15.236
In some countries, they don't want you to have access to information.

16:15.256 --> 16:17.900
I mean, they control what you, what they want you to read.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.786
No, you used to be a crime to teach black people how to read.

16:21.806 --> 16:22.246
Exactly.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.670
Yeah, we haven't gone much farther.

16:24.690 --> 16:24.910
Yeah.

16:25.143 --> 16:30.848
I'm sorry, I was off on my track.

16:30.868 --> 16:31.409
That's okay.

16:31.449 --> 16:35.713
How about, you mentioned you have this very aggressive acquisitions program.

16:35.753 --> 16:36.654
How about deaccessions?

16:37.114 --> 16:45.783
You know, and also the librarian, you more or less characterized him or her as a person who marshals and gathers and organizes them.

16:45.803 --> 16:49.866
How about, you know, you have 1.2 million books stored a mile off campus.

16:50.347 --> 16:52.669
Clearly the books you've put out there are books that nobody's using.

16:53.020 --> 16:56.083
Those are books that no one's checked out, say, in the last 10 years.

16:56.263 --> 16:57.684
So you're making a decision there.

16:59.887 --> 17:00.607
We want to keep them.

17:00.627 --> 17:02.049
We don't want to deaccession them.

17:02.069 --> 17:03.430
But then what's the step after that?

17:03.450 --> 17:12.999
Do you decide that there are any collections that haven't been used in 20 or 30 years, that there's nobody teaching, and that maybe we could use that space for something else?

17:13.059 --> 17:14.380
Yeah, we discard.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.603
We have books there.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.846
Yeah, but how about deaccessioning collections?

17:20.867 --> 17:21.407
Do you do that?

17:22.771 --> 17:23.732
You do that?

17:23.772 --> 17:24.213
Yeah.

17:24.413 --> 17:28.699
Can you think of any collections?

17:28.959 --> 17:32.384
Well, we've taken some collections that we have.

17:32.444 --> 17:36.729
We think that should be, that would be better.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.452
Okay.

17:38.532 --> 17:39.313
Thank you very much.

17:42.577 --> 17:43.799
Yeah, this is it.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.040
Sidebars.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.582
You don't tell the donor's family, don't you?

17:48.164 --> 17:50.167
I don't think he's talking about special collection.

17:50.187 --> 17:52.390
No, I'm not talking about a rare collection.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.144
Did you use the word collection?

17:55.584 --> 17:55.945
I did, yeah.

17:55.965 --> 18:08.864
For example, we had some, I think there were some dissertations in Southeast Asia stored out by, what's this airport out here?

18:09.805 --> 18:11.488
I can't think of the name.

18:11.608 --> 18:12.009
Willow Run.

18:12.029 --> 18:12.830
Yeah, Willow Run.

18:14.332 --> 18:16.495
When I heard about it, I said, we don't have access to this.

18:16.515 --> 18:21.162
Let's send those down to the Center for Research Libraries down in, it's a storage facility.

18:21.344 --> 18:31.097
which they specialize in things like that down in Chicago, and they were so happy to get that, because they handle foreign dissertations, and I knew that, so that's an example.

18:31.898 --> 18:48.239
Let me tell you, I didn't finish one story I was going to tell you, and that's when my provost said, why don't we, rather than sending all those building this physical storage facility onto the bureaus to handle these books, why don't we just digitize them?

18:48.720 --> 18:51.283
So we did a real quick cost analysis.

18:51.483 --> 18:51.864
You did.

18:52.104 --> 18:53.886
So you actually looked into this.

18:54.087 --> 18:54.427
We did.

18:54.848 --> 18:56.490
What if we were to take a 300-page book?

18:56.750 --> 18:58.693
How much would it cost to digitize it?

18:59.174 --> 19:01.858
And we came out with something like a cost of about $75.

19:02.639 --> 19:04.381
But those costs are always going down, too.

19:04.762 --> 19:05.082
Well, no.

19:05.122 --> 19:08.627
As a matter of fact, we've discovered that was a conservative cost.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.809
That was based on scanning.

19:09.929 --> 19:11.691
Like $5 a page, something like that?

19:11.751 --> 19:12.032
Yeah.

19:12.052 --> 19:16.218
Well, they said $0.40 a page, I think.

19:16.238 --> 19:16.979
That's not bad.

19:17.419 --> 19:19.602
Cornell's got it down to $0.18 a page now.

19:19.662 --> 19:20.764
But see, the...

19:20.963 --> 19:26.809
The Mellon Foundation is finding out it's costing more than they'd expected, so I don't know what Cornell's getting its figures.

19:26.829 --> 19:29.952
So what are they calling building a better point?

19:29.972 --> 19:30.112
Mm-hmm.

19:30.132 --> 19:34.316
And see, Bill Bowen is theâ€”he's the economist of, you know, he was president of Princeton.

19:34.457 --> 19:38.381
He comes outâ€”this adjacent project, he takes a special interest in.

19:38.801 --> 19:49.772
Anyway, for the same cost, it would cost, you know, forâ€”if we were to digitize 50,000 volumes, we could build

19:50.090 --> 19:52.535
a storage facility that would accommodate a million volumes.

19:52.956 --> 19:56.944
So they'd probably say, well, economics doesn't add up, so forget about digitizing.

19:57.225 --> 20:00.211
But see, but then again... But what if the numbers were right, though?

20:00.231 --> 20:03.719
I wouldn't have any difficulty in digitizing if they're no longer protected.

20:05.222 --> 20:08.970
Now, people like Toby and the faculty would probably be after me, but no.

20:08.990 --> 20:09.972
I mean, if they're not used,

20:11.403 --> 20:15.729
And when that cost comes down to that point, then... But see, you can ask... It's numbers.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.132
What you're telling me is it's the economics.

20:18.373 --> 20:23.980
The only thing standing between you and getting rid of 50,000 books is how much it's going to cost.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.565
If the price was right, you'd say it's okay.

20:28.066 --> 20:28.567
Oh, I think so.

20:28.627 --> 20:29.928
And how would you pick the 50,000 books?

20:29.968 --> 20:32.472
Which 50,000 books would you pick out of your six million?

20:32.672 --> 20:33.293
Well, okay.

20:33.931 --> 20:38.941
For example, in the storage facility, naturally you have to pick the ones that are no longer protected by copyright.

20:39.361 --> 20:41.686
I would probably pick the ones that have not circulated.

20:41.706 --> 20:44.712
I would be real safe to say in the last 15 years.

20:46.435 --> 20:50.683
And when you say not circulated, you mean so much as one person checking it out.

20:50.703 --> 20:51.184
Right, right.

20:51.765 --> 20:56.494
Can you differentiate between use and circulation?

20:56.514 --> 20:56.935
No.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.117
Yeah, I can.

20:58.237 --> 20:58.457
I do.

20:58.938 --> 21:00.199
I can, you know, in my own life.

21:00.219 --> 21:03.163
Well, these are books that haven't seen the storage facility.

21:03.483 --> 21:06.967
This is an academic library, so we can't measure them.

21:06.987 --> 21:09.610
See, in the storage facility, it's closed stacks.

21:09.931 --> 21:16.358
See, so we know who, actually, the book has moved out the shelf because the faculty do not go into the stack area.

21:16.379 --> 21:18.541
It's a closed stack in the storage facility.

21:18.561 --> 21:24.068
You use the words concurrently, use them without separation, use and circulate.

21:24.088 --> 21:25.870
That's my question.

21:25.890 --> 21:26.010
Hello?

21:26.412 --> 21:28.234
Well, I left my card on the card.

21:28.254 --> 21:34.563
It used to be that the library got money based upon the circulation tables.

21:34.583 --> 21:37.086
And we started yelling and screaming about that.

21:37.106 --> 21:38.288
Yeah, no, we don't do that.

21:38.308 --> 21:40.491
I use use as my word, not circulate.

21:40.691 --> 21:42.453
You use the two words interchangeably.

21:42.473 --> 21:43.214
That's all the manscaped.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.656
Only in the beer facility, Toby.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.021
Because, see, there, here we have open stacks.

21:48.201 --> 21:50.344
So we have a lot of people go into the stack area.

21:50.712 --> 21:53.776
And they'll take books off the shelf and sit down at the table and read them right there.

21:53.896 --> 21:54.357
That's what I call use.

21:54.377 --> 21:55.038
Yeah, right, right.

21:55.058 --> 21:59.343
But see, in the beer facility, if they want a book, it has to be retrieved, okay?

21:59.363 --> 22:02.387
So we know, we keep a record, that book was actually called for.

22:02.567 --> 22:07.333
It may be only used in the library there at the beer facility, and it's not checked out.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.234
I'm following all that.

22:08.255 --> 22:12.420
Don't y'all tell me that I'm giving you my email address.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.902
Well, you may have several questions after you.

22:14.002 --> 22:17.226
It's bouncing from circulation to use, and for me, use is a higher form.

22:18.168 --> 22:20.511
Yeah, that's fax, email, phone, address.

22:20.591 --> 22:21.211
Okay, good.

22:21.231 --> 22:23.294
That's more than information I have on my card.

22:23.314 --> 22:23.914
But let's go back.

22:23.934 --> 22:26.978
You said you'd do a... Would you want to... We didn't want him finish what he was saying.

22:27.138 --> 22:27.218
No.

22:27.258 --> 22:28.860
This is interesting.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.740
You don't want to finish?

22:29.761 --> 22:31.102
Yeah, you read all that stuff.

22:31.582 --> 22:31.763
Okay.

22:31.783 --> 22:33.705
We said you'd have a group, maybe.

22:33.725 --> 22:36.688
Maybe you'd have somebody study the books, copyright, and then we stopped.

22:36.708 --> 22:37.529
So let's go.

22:38.890 --> 22:39.491
We're on.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.572
Great.

22:40.632 --> 22:41.693
Thank you.

22:41.713 --> 22:42.334
Thanks very much.

22:42.634 --> 22:43.195
Okay.

22:43.235 --> 22:43.856
Thank you.

22:43.876 --> 22:45.277
Wonderful.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.378
Thank you.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.820
All right.

22:48.003 --> 22:51.849
Okay, I'll go back and talk about how I would determine.

22:51.869 --> 22:53.671
What I wrote is just to be in the safe side.

22:54.052 --> 22:59.901
Yeah, I would consult with the faculty and tell them what I plan to do.

23:00.902 --> 23:13.200
These books have not been used in 15 years, therefore I want to digitize them and save space and also make them accessible to the world, so to speak, which they cannot, they're not accessible if they had to come here.

23:13.301 --> 23:15.083
And then what would you do with the 50,000 books?

23:15.464 --> 23:16.305
I would sell them, yeah.

23:17.905 --> 23:23.052
I would put them in book sales.

23:23.172 --> 23:31.144
So there's no particular... Or give them to another... There's no attachment, then, that you don't feel any special attachment, then, to the printed book.

23:31.164 --> 23:33.267
I mean, I think... No, but that's going a little bit too far.

23:34.268 --> 23:37.573
I'm a strong believer in collections, in special collections.

23:37.933 --> 23:40.437
And I also, there's just something about a book.

23:40.720 --> 23:47.067
You know, and the computer won't do this for some time, but even the olio from the smell of it.

23:47.087 --> 23:47.968
I mean, that turns me on.

23:48.028 --> 23:49.390
Maybe that turns you off the doctor.

23:50.071 --> 23:50.131
No.

23:50.151 --> 23:51.412
It turns me on a very, very way.

23:51.532 --> 23:52.614
No, but when I go on.

23:52.634 --> 23:53.795
Especially his own books.

23:53.835 --> 23:54.095
Right.

23:54.136 --> 24:04.127
When I go into special collections, and see what my projections are, and I've done some writing on this, about that we're going to have a demise of the reference book as we know it.

24:04.147 --> 24:04.928
You know, like book books.

24:05.028 --> 24:05.949
Who's who in America?

24:05.969 --> 24:07.251
And his books, you know, they're going to be.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.993
And I think that's correct, by the way.

24:09.153 --> 24:09.293
Mm-hmm.

24:09.695 --> 24:17.884
Mike Keller at Stanford, you know, points out, he said, you get some monographs that cost, you're only going to sell three or four hundred of them at best.

24:17.904 --> 24:20.026
They're going to cost you two, three hundred dollars to buy.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.730
And in the sciences, they're going to be obsolete the day they come out.

24:25.252 --> 24:28.435
Doesn't it make better sense to make them available here?

24:28.515 --> 24:31.018
Go to what you want, download print that you want.

24:31.218 --> 24:34.541
The graphics of the color now are such that they're extraordinary.

24:35.002 --> 24:36.023
It's awfully hard.

24:36.239 --> 24:40.024
To argue with that, it's awfully hard to argue with putting the OED online.

24:40.044 --> 24:40.224
I know.

24:40.244 --> 24:43.208
In the words of Christophageism, the Encyclopedia Britannica.

24:43.288 --> 24:47.052
You know, I mean, you have to acknowledge there are certain areas that it makes sense.

24:47.172 --> 24:49.595
That's right.

24:50.737 --> 24:51.418
Well, whatever.

24:52.038 --> 24:55.663
You know, you can't be a total Luddite here in some of this stuff.

24:55.823 --> 24:57.225
I'd like to see all the reference books.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.386
I would like to see journals.

24:58.646 --> 25:02.411
I think someday we will see the demise of the journals we know of.

25:02.431 --> 25:05.655
I think you'll go in and you'll access information on the topic.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.563
and you have proceedings, book chapters, and so-called journals.

25:10.845 --> 25:21.078
My concern, I think the publishers are very concerned about are they going to lose their shirts with some of the journals, because these journals are really expensive.

25:21.579 --> 25:30.411
You know, there's almost a racket going on here whereby professors generate all this intellectual property, and then for some journals now you have to pay $200

25:30.695 --> 25:32.517
per page in order to have your article.

25:32.617 --> 25:35.399
So if you have a 20-page article, what is that?

25:35.459 --> 25:36.801
What's that, $4,000?

25:36.821 --> 25:37.361
$4,000.

25:37.401 --> 25:42.586
You send the $4,000 into the public in order to get promoted and to get tenure.

25:42.606 --> 25:43.186
That's right.

25:43.206 --> 25:44.768
It's almost blackmail, isn't it?

25:44.828 --> 25:45.308
Oh, yeah.

25:45.348 --> 25:46.509
Then they send this.

25:46.529 --> 25:47.670
That counts as a publication?

25:48.271 --> 25:48.571
Yeah.

25:48.591 --> 25:49.012
Oh, yeah.

25:49.032 --> 25:49.652
Journal.

25:49.672 --> 25:49.932
Journal.

25:49.952 --> 25:50.493
Yeah, journal.

25:50.553 --> 25:51.574
See, a journal article.

25:51.594 --> 25:54.577
That's where most of the faculty, that's how they... It's close to a book.

25:54.597 --> 25:55.217
It's a journal.

25:55.497 --> 25:56.458
It's beneath a book.

25:56.478 --> 25:58.440
For example, to... The closest thing to a book.

25:58.555 --> 25:59.776
I added this journal.

26:00.077 --> 26:00.998
I added this journal.

26:01.318 --> 26:05.583
This is the best journal in academic library, academic research life.

26:05.824 --> 26:06.625
Yeah.

26:06.645 --> 26:08.607
I'm the editor of that particular journal.

26:09.468 --> 26:14.594
Now, our rejection rate is, we reject 65% of the articles that are submitted.

26:15.055 --> 26:16.236
Now, that's a high rejection rate.

26:16.256 --> 26:17.678
In other words, only 35% of the articles.

26:17.698 --> 26:18.399
Can I have a copy?

26:18.499 --> 26:19.500
Yeah, you can have a copy.

26:19.868 --> 26:21.530
Matt, thank you.

26:21.551 --> 26:24.555
I'm one of these people who wants everything, by the way.

26:24.675 --> 26:24.916
Okay.

26:24.936 --> 26:30.885
My editorial here is working with the faculty, and that pretty much articulates what I said earlier.

26:31.185 --> 26:33.008
At one time, faculty members knew all the literature.

26:33.228 --> 26:36.513
Now the students know what they do on the web.

26:37.474 --> 26:46.027
But back to this story, then the publishers sell all of this property that's created by the faculty back to the universities at an enormous price.

26:46.208 --> 26:47.850
Some journals like

26:48.303 --> 26:51.066
The Journal of Physics is like 20,000 a year.

26:51.826 --> 26:53.248
These are enormous prices.

26:53.668 --> 26:57.512
How much longer can universities continue to pay all of this, you know?

26:57.712 --> 26:59.694
So... They're supposed to share.

27:00.034 --> 27:00.835
Well, we are sharing.

27:00.855 --> 27:02.376
I'd like to talk a little bit about that.

27:02.396 --> 27:03.437
Why don't you talk a little bit about that?

27:03.457 --> 27:05.099
Okay, I know we're jumping all over the place here.

27:05.119 --> 27:05.419
That's fine.

27:05.439 --> 27:05.900
I like jumping.

27:05.920 --> 27:14.968
Anyway, when I came here in 1991, I went to my provost, Gil Whittaker, and I said, the Big Ten Universities need to do something.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.401
library-wise.

27:17.221 --> 27:21.585
I said, we need to develop more interdependence among these, now there are 13 libraries.

27:21.665 --> 27:23.187
Penn State is part of the Big Ten.

27:23.227 --> 27:27.751
So, actually, it became an athletic conference, going into the library.

27:27.791 --> 27:28.231
Right.

27:28.552 --> 27:32.916
It's called the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, CIC.

27:33.356 --> 27:36.539
And I mentioned to Gil, I said, we need to do something, we need to do something fast.

27:36.559 --> 27:39.482
And he said, well, why don't you develop a strategic plan?

27:40.102 --> 27:42.524
Which I did, and I went and made a presentation as a provost.

27:42.584 --> 27:43.285
And they liked it.

27:43.501 --> 27:46.986
Naturally, but to see, they can oversimplify and think they're going to save a lot of money.

27:47.026 --> 27:51.251
We have saved some money, and I can give you some documentation on that.

27:51.652 --> 27:51.752
Okay.

27:51.772 --> 27:52.353
Yeah.

27:52.373 --> 27:57.340
One of the things, for example, we are taking the Modern Language Association Bibliography here.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.442
I'm talking about the online database.

27:59.963 --> 28:01.185
We're sharing the other 12.

28:02.527 --> 28:03.308
The site license.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.150
But we're saving money.

28:05.470 --> 28:06.772
I mean, all of us are saving money.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.596
The University of Wisconsin is working with Baustein.

28:09.616 --> 28:12.580
That's... Oh, Treonis.

28:13.268 --> 28:17.394
Could you come in here for a second?

28:17.654 --> 28:20.619
I'm trying those guys.

28:20.959 --> 28:24.324
This guy knows exactly what he's doing.

28:24.344 --> 28:26.247
This is our Greek papyrologist.

28:26.287 --> 28:30.613
And Nick was interested in seeing this.

28:30.694 --> 28:33.698
Maybe you could give a demonstration briefly or sometime.

28:33.738 --> 28:36.021
He could pull it up maybe on his homepage.

28:36.402 --> 28:37.243
Can he pull it up?

28:38.144 --> 28:39.386
Maybe there's no need to.

28:39.667 --> 28:40.548
You can have a Luke.

28:41.249 --> 28:42.651
We have a lot of stuff at this month.

28:43.390 --> 28:46.414
It's not appearing yet.

28:46.434 --> 28:50.941
It will appear sometime at the beginning of December.

28:50.961 --> 28:51.602
Okay.

28:52.202 --> 28:54.926
But there is quite a bit online already.

28:54.966 --> 28:55.627
That I can do it.

28:55.687 --> 28:57.390
From samples to exhibits online.

28:57.510 --> 28:57.770
Okay.

28:58.411 --> 28:59.052
That I can do it.

28:59.593 --> 29:00.915
Good.

29:00.935 --> 29:02.517
I'm glad you came down.

29:02.537 --> 29:04.900
Well, June actually has left a message on the machine.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.865
Well, it's probably... We've got to copy the article for it.

29:07.885 --> 29:09.627
You know, I have given away at least 120 copies.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.710
And I kept...

29:12.044 --> 29:13.987
Now, aren't you glad you did it?

29:14.047 --> 29:15.769
Yes, yes, yes.

29:15.789 --> 29:19.054
One of the pieces, the dean said, you better write something.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.417
And then it appeared for a while.

29:22.078 --> 29:24.121
And then she said, you better rewrite.

29:24.141 --> 29:25.984
I rewrote, eventually came out last year.

29:26.104 --> 29:27.305
Working with editors, I know.

29:27.406 --> 29:33.694
The people keep saying that the experience alone that comes out of this article is very useful for similar projects.

29:34.035 --> 29:37.680
This is the oldest collection we have, and it reflects how

29:38.065 --> 29:41.170
This enabling technology can improve the human condition.

29:41.190 --> 29:44.776
I think that when you read this, you'll have a much better appreciation of our civilization.

29:45.517 --> 29:50.946
But I, yeah, but I think the technology... Of course, when you take all your thoughts in your face.

29:51.046 --> 29:55.633
Well, I think it's going to help, you know, with the health and these developing countries.

29:55.653 --> 29:57.276
It's going to help in so many ways.

29:57.917 --> 29:59.460
And with libraries, it's just one way.

29:59.540 --> 30:04.107
Of course, when you have a scholar that comes in and wants to look at these papyrus,

30:04.340 --> 30:12.812
Are you going to allow that scholar to look at the original, or are you going to restrict them to the stuff that's digitized?

30:13.193 --> 30:13.513
No.

30:13.714 --> 30:32.842
We actually use the digital project as a pointer to our actual collection, because ultimately a scholar who is interested in deciphering reading this ancient text, we can start from the screen, of course, because we have very high resolution images, but you have to go ultimately at some stage to the original.

30:33.543 --> 30:33.823
That's right.

30:34.107 --> 30:41.714
This is a concern that some people have, that maybe by putting this... You wonder about the intellectual honesty of it, you know.

30:42.314 --> 30:44.336
Because, as you know, you can manipulate things.

30:44.596 --> 30:48.380
At the same time, you disseminate this information so widely.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.902
That was not possible before.

30:50.922 --> 30:58.249
Before, the only way to do it is to have people write to you to ask for a black and white photograph, which can be very expensive and time-consuming.

30:58.309 --> 31:01.752
Time-consuming is actually the most important factor in our work.

31:02.204 --> 31:05.408
Now, all this, of course, has started into a consortium project.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.110
It's not only the University of Michigan.

31:07.130 --> 31:10.535
We started the whole idea of coming here.

31:10.555 --> 31:13.699
So are you embarked on digitizing the whole collection?

31:14.079 --> 31:14.460
The whole?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.222
Well, we are working in phases.

31:17.463 --> 31:20.928
Phase one will deal with everything that has been published so far.

31:20.988 --> 31:23.952
Published by that means we have started the content of it.

31:23.972 --> 31:25.273
It has appeared in some journals.

31:26.355 --> 31:30.960
So then you published because, therefore, now you're digitizing a published copy?

31:30.980 --> 31:31.401
Yeah.

31:31.820 --> 31:35.265
No, no, no, we're authentic.

31:35.285 --> 31:38.349
How do you scan it if they're fragmentary?

31:38.489 --> 31:42.795
Well, that's after work and after it has been assembled, reassembled by the scholars.

31:42.815 --> 31:46.060
We are hiring experts to do this thing.

31:46.300 --> 31:53.570
So what we do is once we know where the fragments go and they're physically located there, we can scan, shoot.

31:53.671 --> 31:57.135
But then maybe again, what if you later determine that that's not where the fragments go?

31:57.576 --> 32:01.101
Well, you see, then physically you can do that on the screen.

32:01.537 --> 32:02.338
You can move them around.

32:02.358 --> 32:03.059
You can move them around.

32:03.780 --> 32:20.824
That's another side effect, and there are many manuscripts, especially individual papyrides, a paper like that, a contract, which when it was sold from the dealers to the various universities, in some cases, the intention was cut down by the dealer, well, to make more money.

32:20.944 --> 32:26.071
Now, it's the only time, this is our chance, to start putting this together in a sort of virtual mode.

32:26.131 --> 32:27.133
Does this article say that?

32:27.914 --> 32:29.676
Well, I think it mentions that.

32:29.817 --> 32:30.177
Yeah.

32:30.629 --> 32:35.054
It talks a bit more about the research aspect of it and the teaching aspect of it.

32:35.074 --> 32:37.637
You see, now we use images for teaching purposes.

32:37.657 --> 32:43.183
Instead of having the students, you know, if you have a class of ten peopleâ€” Just for the sake of my tape, could you just identify yourself?

32:43.663 --> 32:47.047
My name is Treyanos Gagos, and I'm the associate artist of the collection.

32:47.287 --> 32:48.168
I see.

32:48.188 --> 32:49.730
How long have you been here?

32:50.911 --> 32:51.932
In Ann Arbor, eight years.

32:52.993 --> 32:56.637
Working with the collection eight years, being in this position five years.

32:57.747 --> 33:01.332
And this is your background with Papyrus?

33:01.773 --> 33:03.396
Yes, I am a papyrologist.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.258
A papyrologist.

33:05.278 --> 33:06.600
How do you feel as a papyrologist?

33:06.620 --> 33:13.872
I mean, you really are literally going from one extreme to the other, aren't you, in terms of communications, media?

33:14.713 --> 33:17.497
Well, you know, that's actually a sort of false impression.

33:18.258 --> 33:26.691
If you look back in the history of scholarship, and that's something I mentioned in the article, every single effort from the moment all the ancient libraries were established,

33:26.992 --> 33:33.417
was to preserve and copy and propagate the written work.

33:34.318 --> 33:39.222
When they were writing on rolls, they wrote on rolls because they wanted to put as much information as possible.

33:39.523 --> 33:42.345
When they were copying, they were copying the next generation.

33:42.385 --> 33:45.688
We're doing the same thing, just we use different types of technology.

33:46.148 --> 33:51.673
You know, when you go up and down the screen, what do you do?

33:51.693 --> 33:52.694
I'm alert to that.

33:52.794 --> 33:56.357
There are all these subtle things.

33:57.130 --> 34:03.678
So many thousands of years have passed from the beginnings of this that we have forgotten that we are still living in the same tradition.

34:03.698 --> 34:08.483
We just need different means to propagate this tradition, to continue this tradition.

34:08.543 --> 34:10.866
So you have no problem with that at all?

34:10.886 --> 34:10.946
No.

34:11.006 --> 34:13.810
No, just things are much faster today.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.592
You can do much more at the same time.

34:16.893 --> 34:17.754
Very interesting.

34:18.315 --> 34:18.735
Good.

34:18.755 --> 34:24.062
And this is, I mean, we are thrilled that, you know, relies heavily on text.

34:24.082 --> 34:26.985
And this is the first time, really, that we combine text, image,

34:27.269 --> 34:28.070
and put them together.

34:29.311 --> 34:36.020
I've been told that what he's doing here in Michigan is comparable only in one or two other places in the world.

34:36.040 --> 34:36.520
Is that right?

34:36.881 --> 34:40.645
Well, we started this here, and then other institutions learned from our experience.

34:40.665 --> 34:42.608
And Duke, for instance.

34:42.628 --> 34:44.590
Duke managed to get an NIH grant early on.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.834
Don, is it possible that the trainers could show me some of the papyrus?

34:47.894 --> 34:48.355
Oh, yeah, sure.

34:48.615 --> 34:48.935
You mind?

34:49.156 --> 34:49.936
I will be next door.

34:50.217 --> 34:50.497
Okay.

34:50.517 --> 34:51.218
Come by anytime.

34:51.518 --> 34:52.019
Okay.

34:52.039 --> 34:53.461
Except for two to three when I have a meeting.

34:53.641 --> 34:56.525
Okay, I would, just even if it's only for five minutes.

34:56.565 --> 34:57.467
Oh, I think we'll do it now.

34:57.487 --> 34:57.947
I'll come back.

34:58.128 --> 34:58.488
Do you mind?

34:58.989 --> 35:00.751
This is our reference section.

35:00.771 --> 35:01.833
Okay.

35:01.913 --> 35:04.256
We have everything that comes out with regard to papyrology.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.638
So we are in the department now?

35:05.739 --> 35:06.980
Yes, this is the reading area.

35:07.441 --> 35:09.424
This is where people come around this table and they work.

35:09.444 --> 35:12.168
But this space belongs to this department, basically, right?

35:12.769 --> 35:14.251
This is papyrology, room 807.

35:14.832 --> 35:16.574
And were you a papyrologist in Greece?

35:18.277 --> 35:20.580
Well, this is where I got my first, first, first training.

35:20.830 --> 35:21.571
In Greece or here?

35:21.691 --> 35:22.592
Yeah, no, in Greece.

35:23.093 --> 35:25.356
When I was in my final year as an undergraduate.

35:25.376 --> 35:25.857
Where was this?

35:26.297 --> 35:31.504
In the University of Ioannina, that's northwest, south of Albania.

35:31.544 --> 35:34.428
For the first time, the university offered a class in papyrology.

35:35.489 --> 35:43.099
And I took that class, and I took it at the beginning as a sort of game, you know, playing with the text.

35:43.219 --> 35:44.401
We were starting from Xerox.

35:45.522 --> 35:48.466
Can you imagine now a photograph of a papyrus in Xerox?

35:48.486 --> 35:50.128
It was terrible.

35:50.395 --> 35:51.677
What was your attraction to it?

35:51.697 --> 35:54.741
Just the touching of history?

35:55.182 --> 35:56.804
We had no originals.

35:56.964 --> 35:59.668
I could make out very little about history.

35:59.889 --> 36:02.412
As I said, it was a game in the beginning.

36:02.532 --> 36:03.654
I took it as a challenge.

36:04.315 --> 36:05.076
Here is a text.

36:05.256 --> 36:07.560
Try to see if you can read something out of it.

36:07.580 --> 36:08.381
That's how it started.

36:08.401 --> 36:18.355
The following year, the Greek government announced a program with scholarships for my field, for papyrology, and I had to take exams.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.318
It was competitive.

36:20.450 --> 36:29.543
I managed to get a scholarship, and then a year later, I took a year off, I went to England at the University of Durham, that's northeast.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.183
D-U-R-H-A-M?

36:30.203 --> 36:31.926
Durham?

36:31.946 --> 36:35.030
Yeah, like Durham here, the sister city.

36:36.172 --> 36:40.117
I'm from Massachusetts, so I'm not that familiar with Michigan.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.821
This is where I got a PhD.

36:42.901 --> 36:49.410
I worked on materials sent out there from Oxford, from a particular site in New York, the Oxiricus papyrus.

36:50.639 --> 37:13.159
And then in my final year, during the PhD, I got involved in the building of a textual database that ran actually between Duke University and Durham, North Carolina.

37:13.179 --> 37:13.980
What's this word?

37:14.348 --> 37:16.030
Oxyrhynchus.

37:16.051 --> 37:20.357
Oxyrhynchus is an... O-X-Y-R-H-Y-N-C-H-U-S, yeah.

37:20.377 --> 37:26.947
Yeah, this is a very famous sign in Egypt, where the British excavated the trash piles, basically, of the city, and they discovered it.

37:26.967 --> 37:28.188
Like the Ganesias?

37:28.228 --> 37:29.350
They're the same thing?

37:29.570 --> 37:30.932
I'm sorry?

37:31.213 --> 37:36.681
Like the Hebrew, the Jewish, where they called them a Ganesia, Ganesia, where they buried all the papers and stuff?

37:36.721 --> 37:38.704
No, this was just the trash.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.765
And that was at that close?

37:39.785 --> 37:41.588
This is where the city used to throw its trash.

37:41.608 --> 37:42.870
O-X-Y...

37:43.289 --> 37:46.033
R-H-Y-N-C-H-U-S.

37:46.053 --> 37:46.594
That's a place.

37:46.614 --> 37:47.516
That's the name of the place?

37:47.536 --> 37:48.417
That's a city, yes.

37:48.437 --> 37:49.499
And this city is where again?

37:50.000 --> 37:50.260
Yes.

37:52.564 --> 37:56.229
Close to what you might want to call Middle Egypt.

37:56.249 --> 37:58.032
Actually, have there been any books written about this?

37:58.173 --> 38:00.076
Oh, yeah.

38:00.096 --> 38:02.399
If I wanted to read about this.

38:02.419 --> 38:03.561
About Oxyrincus.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.446
Well, actually, if you want to read generally about paparology.

38:08.289 --> 38:09.811
You mentioned it there, right?

38:09.831 --> 38:10.472
Oh, yeah.

38:10.492 --> 38:11.153
There's a very good book.

38:11.639 --> 38:22.434
This is a very basic introduction.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.796
He actually talks quite a bit.

38:28.082 --> 38:33.950
And this has been published by Oxford University Press.

38:34.310 --> 38:34.991
What year?

38:35.732 --> 38:38.416
Oh, well, there are all sorts of re-editions.

38:38.436 --> 38:39.958
68.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.949
So, of course, you're telling me about this place where all these papyri were found.

38:45.030 --> 38:45.490
Is that right?

38:45.650 --> 38:45.851
Yes.

38:46.511 --> 38:49.995
Well, not all, but I mean a very large number of papyri.

38:50.336 --> 38:52.338
What kinds of things are there?

38:52.378 --> 38:54.320
Very mundane things like that?

38:54.340 --> 38:55.261
Oh, easy papyri?

38:55.281 --> 38:55.582
Yeah.

38:55.602 --> 39:02.049
Anything you can imagine, from literature, known, unknown, unidentified, to daily documents.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.050
Here's a good example.

39:03.070 --> 39:04.091
That's almost the mother of the Lord.

39:04.111 --> 39:05.253
When was this place discovered?

39:06.134 --> 39:08.616
This was discovered in the late 19th century.

39:09.097 --> 39:09.237
Uh-huh.

39:10.229 --> 39:11.170
About a hundred years ago.

39:11.230 --> 39:12.852
From Homer.

39:13.914 --> 39:14.334
Homer?

39:14.554 --> 39:15.075
Really?

39:15.095 --> 39:18.039
Have they found any unknown things?

39:18.059 --> 39:18.880
Daily documents.

39:19.681 --> 39:21.483
How about in terms of literary things?

39:22.104 --> 39:22.544
A lot.

39:22.564 --> 39:22.805
A lot.

39:22.825 --> 39:28.392
A lot of literature that did not survive to us through the Middle Ages.

39:29.854 --> 39:31.095
How come I haven't heard of this place?

39:31.315 --> 39:33.839
Different literary tastes.

39:33.859 --> 39:34.920
That's a serious question.

39:35.018 --> 39:44.232
And actually, this site, a Greek name for an Egyptian site, and another site called Karanis, K-A-R-A-N-I-S.

39:44.472 --> 39:47.757
K-A-R-A-N-I-S, okay.

39:47.777 --> 39:49.840
Which was excavated by the University of Michigan.

39:50.180 --> 39:50.901
Where was this?

39:51.562 --> 39:53.305
Between 1924 and 1935.

39:53.565 --> 39:54.106
Okay.

39:57.231 --> 40:00.756
Are the most promising sites in the United States, I write.

40:00.989 --> 40:05.295
Now, in Oxford, they dug the trash piles and they got the fire out.

40:05.776 --> 40:09.601
In Karan, the University of Michigan excavated the actual town.

40:09.621 --> 40:09.701
Wow.

40:09.721 --> 40:21.077
And they had plants of the houses, streets, papyri found wherever, in any kind of structure, any street, and archaeological objects.

40:22.138 --> 40:28.988
Actually, I'm working on a fellowship this year and trying to put together all these different types of evidence on the weather.

40:29.407 --> 40:34.856
Now, would you say material here is better than to be found in the actual source of this material?

40:35.838 --> 40:36.359
I'm sorry?

40:36.559 --> 40:47.718
Would you say that the quality of the material, in terms of comprehensiveness, is better here than it is to be found, say, at the sites where they were found in Egypt or Greece?

40:47.738 --> 40:53.748
Well, most of the papyri, most collections, were built from purchases from dealers.

40:54.389 --> 40:54.790
I see.

40:55.107 --> 41:00.793
you know, the Egyptian farmers would go to the old sites to remove dirty fertilizing fields.

41:00.813 --> 41:04.016
And along with that, they were removing papyri objects.

41:04.377 --> 41:09.822
When the first Europeans went there with Napoleon, you know, the French, 1812, I think it was the exhibition.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.103
They found the Rosetta Stone.

41:11.163 --> 41:19.932
Well, they are the ones who actually realized when they brought back this material in Europe, yeah, this is the way the scholars realized that this is very important.

41:20.653 --> 41:21.854
We cannot just throw it away.

41:22.575 --> 41:23.376
Because that's what

41:23.913 --> 41:25.555
the farmers were doing.

41:26.316 --> 41:29.139
And this is when the first dealers, European dealers, went there.

41:29.560 --> 41:35.306
Now, if you have purchases from dealers, in most cases, in many cases, you don't know where the fire comes from.

41:36.648 --> 41:37.629
They come from a village.

41:37.809 --> 41:41.353
Sure, we know by name, but in these cases, we know the actual site.

41:41.393 --> 41:44.257
We know where exactly it was located.

41:44.597 --> 41:49.583
Now, these are the annual reports of, these are the annual publications.

41:50.626 --> 41:51.187
Why?

41:51.747 --> 41:54.010
I could probably find this at Harvard, I would bet, huh?

41:54.030 --> 41:54.871
Yes.

41:54.891 --> 41:57.314
I'm sure Harvard has everything.

41:57.334 --> 41:59.717
Go ahead, I've got the tape on, so you can talk.

41:59.757 --> 42:06.465
Yes, and here we have, you know, the, I was talking to you about the Karanis that we have in our collection.

42:06.485 --> 42:06.765
Yeah.

42:06.785 --> 42:07.546
This is one text.

42:08.167 --> 42:11.250
This entire volume contains one text.

42:11.270 --> 42:11.991
Really?

42:12.011 --> 42:12.772
They have a whole text?

42:12.792 --> 42:17.157
This is the most complete tax roll we have from the ancient world, from one village.

42:18.605 --> 42:20.667
6,000 lines.

42:20.947 --> 42:21.387
Wow.

42:23.309 --> 42:24.730
What's the title of that book?

42:26.132 --> 42:29.034
Doctorals from Koranis.

42:29.074 --> 42:31.657
There we spell K-A-R-A-N-I-S-H.

42:31.717 --> 42:33.218
And this is in the Michigan papyrus.

42:33.618 --> 42:35.940
University of Michigan.

42:35.960 --> 42:40.685
It's out of frame.

42:40.705 --> 42:42.866
Crickle-woman memoirs.

42:43.087 --> 42:45.008
Is there all this stuff going online now?

42:45.168 --> 42:46.129
I imagine.

42:46.830 --> 42:46.890
No.

42:47.562 --> 42:50.805
The British will have to make their own decision.

42:50.825 --> 42:53.488
Our stuff is going to go online.

42:53.929 --> 42:57.232
The Columbia stuff is going to go online.

42:57.432 --> 42:57.953
And more.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.034
And these are pretty old, too.

42:59.054 --> 42:59.855
And more, yes.

43:00.876 --> 43:03.779
Most of them are out of print, actually.

43:04.620 --> 43:12.068
We will have a test on the web around the beginning, hopefully the beginning of December, with volume three.

43:13.069 --> 43:13.249
This one.

43:13.567 --> 43:18.794
which is titled the Miscellaneous Papyri, Winter, W-I-N-C, as a person.

43:19.295 --> 43:20.736
Again, in the Michigan Papyri series.

43:21.197 --> 43:22.759
That's called the Michigan Papyri.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.001
Michigan Papyri.

43:25.923 --> 43:29.628
That's volume three.

43:29.929 --> 43:33.073
So how did it happen that Michigan came to be so preeminent?

43:34.014 --> 43:38.680
Through Francis W. Kelsey, who was a professor of flat in here.

43:39.402 --> 43:40.183
No, no.

43:40.343 --> 43:41.104
On State Street.

43:41.124 --> 43:44.027
Did you go on State Street?

43:44.047 --> 43:45.208
I just really am.

43:45.228 --> 43:48.872
You have Angel Hall on the one side, and then the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology.

43:48.892 --> 43:51.975
Oh, the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology is here.

43:52.075 --> 43:59.363
And Francis W. Kelsey was a professor of Latin here at the turn of the century, and he traveled extensively.

43:59.403 --> 44:04.628
He went to Egypt, too, and he saw what was happening, and he knew that the Europeans were building up their collections.

44:05.009 --> 44:06.410
His name was Francis Kelsey?

44:06.430 --> 44:08.092
Francis W. Kelsey.

44:08.112 --> 44:09.173
K-E-L-S-E-Y.

44:09.777 --> 44:11.600
Yes.

44:12.902 --> 44:14.684
And he started building the collection.

44:14.704 --> 44:15.866
And then 75 cents.

44:15.886 --> 44:18.510
So it's a joke, right?

44:18.530 --> 44:19.512
This is a room within a room.

44:19.932 --> 44:20.273
OK.

44:20.653 --> 44:21.695
What do we call this room?

44:21.915 --> 44:23.117
Environmental cleaner.

44:23.217 --> 44:23.417
OK.

44:23.538 --> 44:27.424
It's a safety box.

44:27.884 --> 44:28.826
Well, it's not in the safety box.

44:28.846 --> 44:32.171
We call it the Dear Vault.

44:32.191 --> 44:37.759
Steady humidity at 45% to 46%.

44:38.077 --> 44:40.741
Temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

44:40.761 --> 44:44.847
This is duplicating basically the conditions in the desert.

44:44.867 --> 44:46.350
This is how they survive.

44:46.910 --> 44:49.554
Any other place in the world they would... Right?

44:49.995 --> 44:54.582
And this is the only collection that has this kind of furniture.

44:55.003 --> 44:57.707
Most collections don't.

44:57.727 --> 44:59.710
We have not seen any... There's nothing like this in Greece?

44:59.750 --> 45:01.232
There's nothing like this in England?

45:01.252 --> 45:01.412
No.

45:01.753 --> 45:03.736
There's nothing like this anywhere in the United States.

45:04.457 --> 45:05.198
Or anywhere in Europe?

45:05.431 --> 45:09.696
Greece doesn't have very big papyrus collections.

45:09.716 --> 45:10.517
Papyrus didn't survive in this.

45:10.537 --> 45:11.659
It's too humid.

45:12.119 --> 45:14.182
I don't know what's everywhere.

45:14.202 --> 45:15.344
Let me survive there, right?

45:15.384 --> 45:19.168
Nothing really doesn't.

45:19.188 --> 45:21.451
You can see why we call it the beer vault.

45:21.712 --> 45:22.773
We call it the what vault?

45:23.073 --> 45:23.694
The beer vault.

45:23.894 --> 45:24.355
The beer.

45:24.816 --> 45:25.076
Beer.

45:25.536 --> 45:26.217
Like beer?

45:26.237 --> 45:27.339
Oh, like we drink beer.

45:27.479 --> 45:28.500
Yes.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.383
So, all the locals can see around here.

45:30.603 --> 45:33.126
It's a huge collection.

45:34.017 --> 45:38.043
We honestly still don't know how much we can.

45:38.063 --> 45:41.188
Although, we've been researching for 75 years.

45:44.293 --> 45:47.518
We're looking at the log class of 1890 collections.

45:47.979 --> 45:52.306
The three first lockers contain mounds of iron guns.

45:52.766 --> 46:01.560
We do this to prevent damage, also for display purposes and for research purposes.

46:02.266 --> 46:13.099
The text roll I showed to you of the published book, all this, all this, about 105 frames are one text.

46:13.119 --> 46:14.921
Is that that text?

46:14.941 --> 46:15.041
Yeah.

46:15.061 --> 46:17.103
Look at that, huh?

46:17.123 --> 46:21.268
Text roll, Karanis, K-R-A-N-I-S, 172-173AD.

46:22.049 --> 46:23.651
How did you determine the age?

46:24.112 --> 46:24.512
We know it.

46:25.273 --> 46:26.695
It's specified.

46:26.715 --> 46:31.640
Most documentary texts, daily texts, are dated by the emperor.

46:31.660 --> 46:32.121
Really?

46:32.422 --> 46:36.889
So we know exactly where they were written, the exact date, month date.

46:37.129 --> 46:44.781
We're looking at something here that's, what, you know, 1,700, 1,800 years old, right?

46:44.801 --> 46:45.903
It looks like it could have been written.

46:46.263 --> 46:48.447
What was the ink?

46:48.507 --> 46:49.008
Very basic.

46:49.709 --> 46:53.154
Soot from the chimney in water.

46:53.174 --> 46:54.897
And how did they make the quill?

46:54.917 --> 46:56.499
Were these a quill for a pen?

46:56.960 --> 46:57.721
Oh, just the reed.

46:58.142 --> 47:00.285
They sharpened the reed, and then just

47:00.535 --> 47:01.736
And these are recording what?

47:01.776 --> 47:02.537
Tax things?

47:02.777 --> 47:06.521
These are recording in detail all the mails of this village.

47:06.822 --> 47:07.523
All the what?

47:07.583 --> 47:08.183
All the mails?

47:08.864 --> 47:12.047
Yeah, women in the village.

47:12.067 --> 47:17.373
That had to pay all sorts of different types of... And what language is this?

47:17.393 --> 47:18.114
This is all in Greek.

47:19.015 --> 47:20.156
And it goes... Can you read this?

47:20.296 --> 47:20.897
Yes.

47:20.917 --> 47:24.861
You see, this is the 14th day of the month, whatever the month is.

47:24.981 --> 47:26.123
It's a ledger.

47:26.543 --> 47:27.144
It's a day book.

47:28.085 --> 47:30.087
And then they list the names of the people that paid.

47:30.539 --> 47:34.745
And on the right here, they record the exact amount that each person paid.

47:34.765 --> 47:37.068
So the name, an individual's name is here.

47:37.208 --> 47:38.149
Can you read one for me?

47:38.229 --> 47:39.210
Can you see one?

47:39.230 --> 47:39.451
No.

47:43.176 --> 47:44.778
The name of this guy is Heraklas.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.182
And he's Apator, fatherless.

47:49.264 --> 47:50.946
It's a very interesting case.

47:51.587 --> 47:53.429
Where does it say fatherless?

47:53.790 --> 47:54.671
Here, Apator.

47:54.691 --> 47:55.532
He has no father.

47:56.213 --> 47:57.555
So why is that important, do you think?

47:57.675 --> 48:00.158
It's very important because the father probably...

48:00.712 --> 48:01.333
was not known.

48:02.635 --> 48:10.769
And in this case, when they don't know the name of the father in official records, they give the name of the mother, and that's what we have here, Me, abbreviated.

48:12.051 --> 48:19.444
His mother being, and I think this is Tao Nof, and it's abbreviated.

48:19.464 --> 48:21.167
Oh, Nofris, maybe.

48:21.187 --> 48:23.050
That was the name of the mother.

48:23.691 --> 48:25.875
And then here you have eight drachmas.

48:26.868 --> 48:34.057
This is a single like S, this is a single for drachma, and eta in Greek, the counting system in Greek, is 8.

48:34.718 --> 48:36.700
The writing is remarkably good, isn't it?

48:36.720 --> 48:37.782
The quality of the writing.

48:37.802 --> 48:39.564
I was just talking about how well it's preserved.

48:39.784 --> 48:41.646
I mean, these were literary people, weren't they?

48:41.666 --> 48:42.608
Yeah.

48:42.668 --> 48:44.410
Well, this was done by the tax collectors.

48:44.430 --> 48:47.694
Tax collectors were normally rather well-educated people.

48:47.854 --> 48:50.177
We have a suspicion we know where it was found.

48:50.437 --> 48:53.521
We know the actual structure, because this was not excavated.

48:54.262 --> 48:55.744
It was purchased locally.

48:56.146 --> 48:57.368
During the excavations.

48:57.428 --> 48:59.912
That particular item you just showed me?

49:00.413 --> 49:01.235
Yes.

49:01.515 --> 49:03.579
Not all of these frames?

49:03.599 --> 49:05.462
That particular item that you just pulled out?

49:05.482 --> 49:06.323
No, all these frames.

49:06.644 --> 49:07.525
All of these frames?

49:07.726 --> 49:09.990
They are all one text.

49:10.070 --> 49:11.272
But how were they found?

49:11.312 --> 49:13.015
This was 106 feet long.

49:13.556 --> 49:14.938
This was found as one scroll?

49:14.958 --> 49:15.038
Yes.

49:16.260 --> 49:17.182
And it survived?

49:17.703 --> 49:17.903
Yes.

49:19.145 --> 49:19.927
Now who broke it up?

49:20.027 --> 49:21.850
It was cut down here.

49:22.083 --> 49:24.306
For mounting purposes, you can see.

49:24.326 --> 49:26.309
So the scroll went in this direction?

49:26.369 --> 49:26.810
Yes.

49:27.150 --> 49:27.731
And how did they read?

49:27.751 --> 49:28.893
Did they read from left to right?

49:28.913 --> 49:29.493
From left to right.

49:31.416 --> 49:34.220
As I said, when it first came here, it was 106 feet long.

49:34.340 --> 49:34.741
Wow.

49:35.342 --> 49:40.609
We had to go into the records to find out what they did to do their records, how it was preserved.

49:40.629 --> 49:45.296
At the time, it was thought that the best way to keep this was to cut it down into sections.

49:45.316 --> 49:46.197
Did they do that today?

49:47.198 --> 49:47.579
I don't know.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.503
I'm actually working on another row right now.

49:51.293 --> 49:52.374
that is still rolled.

49:52.394 --> 49:52.615
Here?

49:54.657 --> 49:57.120
It's not as long, but it's very important.

49:57.320 --> 49:59.363
Recently acquired, or has been here all these years?

49:59.383 --> 50:00.945
It was from the excavations.

50:00.965 --> 50:04.068
So we're just getting around to it now?

50:04.088 --> 50:04.189
Yeah.

50:04.209 --> 50:07.192
And this is just the process of the next in line, is that right?

50:08.113 --> 50:08.213
Yeah.

50:08.233 --> 50:09.996
That's fascinating.

50:10.016 --> 50:10.496
Yeah.

50:10.516 --> 50:12.839
But most of the papyrus kept in boxes like this.

50:13.199 --> 50:13.820
And look at this.

50:15.803 --> 50:17.705
So this material would not have survived.

50:17.765 --> 50:20.288
I mean, this is a climatic

50:20.842 --> 50:22.263
Yes, yes.

50:22.503 --> 50:27.948
And this stuff was just taken out and dumped, in many cases, at the other sites you're telling me about.

50:28.709 --> 50:37.296
Well, in most cases, you know, the people, they would use the papyrus, they would write them to one side and write them to the other side, and then, that was it.

50:37.316 --> 50:42.401
So, they were recording payments, but there was no intent to keep the stuff alive.

50:42.581 --> 50:48.746
They kept them for a while, but then, after the expiration of those dates, the stuff would be thrown away.

50:48.787 --> 50:49.347
That's right.

50:49.968 --> 50:52.130
Do they tell us much about ancient life?

50:52.651 --> 50:59.739
Well, if we know something in detail about the ancient life today, about daily life in the ancient world, we know things like the papyri.

51:00.680 --> 51:09.529
Until they discovered the papyri, a century ago, what we knew about daily life in the ancient world was based completely on literature.

51:09.549 --> 51:11.772
And, of course, there is a fictional element.

51:12.312 --> 51:12.853
That's right.

51:13.205 --> 51:17.252
And also the literature is only going to focus on a certain segment of the society.

51:17.312 --> 51:18.434
And it's written by one person.

51:18.554 --> 51:21.319
It has all these limitations.

51:21.520 --> 51:29.814
So inscriptions in papyri actually have contributed very heavily to knowing how, you know, everyday people think about this.

51:29.834 --> 51:32.239
And what was your intention when you were studying at university?

51:32.259 --> 51:33.020
What were your plans?

51:34.463 --> 51:35.645
Well, I had no plans.

51:35.725 --> 51:37.508
I was just, I took it as a challenge.

51:37.859 --> 51:41.604
Were you attending on a career as a scholar?

51:41.624 --> 51:43.347
No, you were just studying that.

51:43.567 --> 51:43.868
I did.

51:44.408 --> 51:48.414
Well, in a field like this, you would study paparology.

51:48.454 --> 51:49.796
You had to continue working.

51:50.096 --> 51:51.939
It was very hard to switch after that.

51:51.959 --> 51:52.900
It was very hard to what?

51:52.921 --> 51:56.125
To switch, to get into something else.

51:56.145 --> 52:01.212
I mean, we are in the first place classicists, you know, philologists.

52:01.232 --> 52:05.478
And we do part of our work now, teaching the classics.

52:05.498 --> 52:06.600
But in terms of research,

52:07.070 --> 52:08.472
This is our material.

52:08.512 --> 52:09.734
We're trained to do this.

52:09.754 --> 52:11.336
And you're at a great place for this, obviously.

52:11.356 --> 52:11.637
Yes.

52:12.217 --> 52:14.561
And there are very few of us in the world.

52:14.921 --> 52:17.425
So you have a fraternity of a few, I gather.

52:17.445 --> 52:17.645
Yeah.

52:17.665 --> 52:18.587
Let me show you just that.

52:18.607 --> 52:21.110
Let's get our papyrus in a box.

52:22.232 --> 52:24.015
You can see how flexible they still are.

52:24.916 --> 52:36.092
They still are.

52:36.112 --> 52:36.773
Here's a cake.

52:37.208 --> 52:40.291
This is very fragmentary.

52:43.354 --> 52:45.356
Look at it.

52:45.436 --> 52:46.397
How is it kept together?

52:46.417 --> 52:49.820
Of course, it's a reed, right?

52:51.462 --> 52:55.666
It's a big reed, 12, 13 feet.

52:55.846 --> 53:04.975
The papyrus has very large stems, so what they do is they extract stripes, fibers, which they place horizontal liver very closely.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.116
They pound strips.

53:06.416 --> 53:07.097
Strips, yes.

53:07.415 --> 53:15.805
And then they pound the two layers that cells break, and that's what keeps the two layers together, and they polish it very heavily.

53:15.825 --> 53:17.347
Yes, they did right on both sides.

53:18.228 --> 53:20.290
This is what I call recycling in the ancient world.

53:20.310 --> 53:24.015
I don't hold it, but what are these holes, or that's just natural deterioration, I gather?

53:24.596 --> 53:25.657
Well, maybe wormholes.

53:27.038 --> 53:29.602
You know, worms like papyrus, because that's a plant.

53:29.622 --> 53:30.342
It tastes good.

53:31.884 --> 53:36.730
There are reports that papyrus was even edible in the ancient world.

53:37.148 --> 53:37.869
People would have it.

53:38.310 --> 53:39.973
They would make shoes out of it.

53:39.993 --> 53:42.717
They would make boats out of it.

53:42.737 --> 53:43.639
Does it still grow?

53:43.659 --> 53:46.925
It's like a weed over there?

53:46.945 --> 53:47.606
It is.

53:47.646 --> 53:48.828
It's all over the place.

53:48.848 --> 53:50.491
It goes to Egypt along the Nile.

53:51.572 --> 53:52.895
It's all over the place.

53:52.915 --> 53:53.876
That's papyrus.

53:53.916 --> 53:59.646
Of course, the story was when they found Pergamum and they had the big argument with Alexandria,

53:59.795 --> 54:06.062
They stopped the exportation of papyrus, so they improved parchment.

54:06.122 --> 54:07.604
It's a great story, but we don't know that.

54:07.624 --> 54:11.108
We don't know to what extent that's true.

54:11.128 --> 54:19.698
Except that parchment does mean it's a medieval Latin phrase from Pergamum, so it certainly does have that provenance.

54:20.159 --> 54:23.963
No, I accept this theory that there are people that don't.

54:24.145 --> 54:27.893
Except the parchment was in use long before Pergamum came along.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.058
I mean, the Jews used it, the Persians used it.

54:30.078 --> 54:33.605
Right, but it was not used extensively because it's more expensive.

54:33.625 --> 54:35.269
You have to kill many animals.

54:35.289 --> 54:39.077
Yeah, not only that, this stuff wasn't meant for the 80s, right?

54:39.298 --> 54:39.538
Yes.

54:39.991 --> 54:42.635
When you do parchment, it is meant for the ages, I think.

54:42.695 --> 54:47.082
Parchment is also more durable, and it doesn't deteriorate as fast as the virus.

54:47.883 --> 54:51.428
I mean, if you have a papyrus roll a hundred and sixty feet long, you want to get to the end of it.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.032
You have to roll them all the time, right?

54:54.252 --> 54:58.298
Well, through that process, however, the papyrus doesn't do damage.

54:58.319 --> 55:04.648
I suspect that was a very serious reason for considering alternative writing.

55:04.628 --> 55:15.440
Do you have any clay tablets here?

55:16.561 --> 55:22.908
We had pot charts, but most of that stuff has been returned to Egypt.

55:22.928 --> 55:25.791
That was part of the excavations in Karan.

55:25.831 --> 55:30.636
The deal with the Egyptian government was to

55:30.937 --> 55:38.103
keep them here for 30 years, keep all the materials here, and then return whatever the agreement was at the time, X amount of them.

55:38.123 --> 55:41.146
What would you say are the oldest papyrus that you have?

55:41.166 --> 55:44.469
The oldest we have here is from around the 12th century BC.

55:45.930 --> 55:48.452
It's a copy of the Book of the Dead.

55:48.693 --> 55:49.193
And that's here?

55:49.553 --> 55:50.414
Yes, that's here.

55:50.694 --> 55:55.439
Actually, it's not right here, right now, but it's on display in the Kelsey Museum right now.

55:55.459 --> 55:56.840
How about that other roll?

55:56.980 --> 55:58.601
Is that here, the one that you're working with?

55:59.042 --> 56:00.403
That's still a roll?

56:00.755 --> 56:02.657
I'm afraid to touch that.

56:02.757 --> 56:04.459
Okay, can you show it to me without touching it?

56:05.800 --> 56:06.461
You don't have to touch it.

56:06.501 --> 56:07.281
I'd just like to see it.

56:07.301 --> 56:09.503
Actually, part of that has been mounted in glass.

56:11.245 --> 56:18.172
Don't open it.

56:18.192 --> 56:19.853
I can just see it.

56:20.134 --> 56:22.136
We use paper to protect it.

56:22.256 --> 56:23.897
And then it takes the shape of the paper.

56:24.658 --> 56:28.462
So it rolls inside of this and it rolls around.

56:28.482 --> 56:29.783
But this is part of it.

56:30.235 --> 56:31.376
And where was this recovered?

56:32.137 --> 56:33.419
It was in Karanis again.

56:33.579 --> 56:35.321
That's quite a sight then.

56:35.341 --> 56:35.581
Oh yes.

56:36.242 --> 56:39.806
That sight produced about 5,000 individual papyrates.

56:40.507 --> 56:41.428
And where again was that?

56:41.448 --> 56:42.829
Is that Egypt did you say as well?

56:43.170 --> 56:45.172
All the papyri that we had here come from Egypt.

56:46.093 --> 56:50.258
And papyrus was preserved primarily in Egypt because of the climate conditions.

56:50.678 --> 56:53.802
I mean we have papyri from the caves in Israel.

56:54.543 --> 56:57.306
We have papyri from Herculaneum in Israel.

56:58.265 --> 56:58.806
Carbonized.

56:59.026 --> 57:01.028
That's all because of the eruption.

57:01.348 --> 57:05.933
And we have very simply papaya also from Petra in Jordan.

57:06.374 --> 57:08.276
Again, carbonized next to Vincent King Church.

57:08.296 --> 57:10.438
I'm actually working with that program.

57:10.458 --> 57:12.560
I go to Jordan every year, every summer.

57:12.580 --> 57:14.462
So is this exciting for you?

57:14.762 --> 57:15.543
It's more than a job.

57:15.643 --> 57:16.124
Oh, yeah.

57:16.384 --> 57:17.245
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:17.405 --> 57:20.268
I don't take it as a job.

57:20.288 --> 57:20.489
No.

57:20.809 --> 57:25.574
It's what I've been doing for the rest of my life.

57:25.594 --> 57:26.155
Makes a pose.

57:26.435 --> 57:26.635
Thank you.

57:27.340 --> 57:28.721
This is great.

57:28.782 --> 57:29.943
This is a treat.

57:29.963 --> 57:32.165
And these books here are old?

57:32.185 --> 57:34.107
These are not part of our collection, actually.

57:34.127 --> 57:37.091
These are part of special collections, but we're always going to mention special collections.

57:37.111 --> 57:42.777
And these are Islamic manuscripts, 18th and 19th centuries, maybe 17th too.

57:42.797 --> 57:47.382
And we have also a very small collection of Western manuscripts.

57:48.283 --> 57:55.170
And by that we mean manuscripts in Greek and Latin, or even parchment and paper after the 9th century.

58:00.466 --> 58:03.671
You seem to know where everything is, though.

58:03.731 --> 58:05.594
You can put your name right on.

58:05.614 --> 58:07.757
Vulgate Bible here, 13th century.

58:08.218 --> 58:09.480
Now, this is an original book.

58:10.441 --> 58:11.283
Look at the vinyl.

58:11.623 --> 58:13.005
Wow.

58:13.025 --> 58:13.967
What are we looking at here?

58:14.287 --> 58:14.688
Wow.

58:14.788 --> 58:17.312
This is a Coptic manuscript.

58:17.332 --> 58:20.377
This is probably 7th or 8th century.

58:20.397 --> 58:20.637
My God.

58:20.777 --> 58:21.919
Is that the original scrap?

58:21.939 --> 58:22.860
This is the original scrap.

58:23.862 --> 58:24.783
And I don't want to open it.

58:24.883 --> 58:25.524
No, I don't play well.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.127
What is the text?

58:27.227 --> 58:27.568
I don't know.

58:27.588 --> 58:28.549
I have to check it out.

58:29.069 --> 58:30.331
I've seen it.

58:30.351 --> 58:31.513
I expect it's Christian.

58:31.613 --> 58:32.875
It's probably the Bible.

58:35.960 --> 58:36.661
Oh, my goodness.

58:37.762 --> 58:39.205
This is a nice Islamic manuscript.

58:39.225 --> 58:39.886
This is the Koran.

58:41.388 --> 58:42.229
Look at that.

58:43.131 --> 58:47.497
Look at that illumination there, huh?

58:47.517 --> 58:52.265
Many of these manuscripts, you know, this is a holy book.

58:52.285 --> 58:54.628
And how old do you estimate this?

58:55.109 --> 58:57.793
Like six months, this was bought at auction, I gather.

58:59.630 --> 59:00.651
Oh, it's very possible.

59:00.851 --> 59:01.712
Many of this is rare.

59:03.254 --> 59:08.199
It's on paper, so I suspect this could be... Look at that.

59:08.800 --> 59:11.903
This could be 14th century.

59:13.364 --> 59:13.544
Wow.

59:13.564 --> 59:15.386
It's not early, eh?

59:15.406 --> 59:17.509
That is... This is unbelievable here.

59:20.732 --> 59:20.872
Yeah.

59:20.932 --> 59:24.736
Michigan MS-248, just for the sake of my tape, the 248.

59:25.797 --> 59:28.540
That's the one in the original binding of object manuscripts.

59:29.633 --> 59:32.596
This is again from Egypt, this one.

59:32.616 --> 59:34.818
Most of these were purchased in Cairo.

59:34.898 --> 59:37.600
Look at the strap though, even the strap.

59:38.361 --> 59:42.525
So that's like a carrying case, it's almost like a purse in a way, it's almost like a shirt.

59:43.626 --> 59:51.813
It's possible that people were carrying this in churches, you know, what they would get from the service.

59:51.833 --> 59:52.314
Here's another.

59:53.395 --> 59:54.115
This is in Greek.

59:55.096 --> 59:57.278
This is again on paper and later.

01:00:02.405 --> 01:00:17.218
Okay, good.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:17.459
Beautiful.

01:00:17.479 --> 01:00:18.159
Well, that's great.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:19.981
Okay.

01:00:20.001 --> 01:00:21.462
I don't think I feel much of your time.

01:00:21.903 --> 01:00:25.266
And you can see what we have, you know, electronically.

01:00:27.728 --> 01:00:31.431
So, when you came here, have they already embarked on this digital program?

01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:32.412
That's my baby.

01:00:33.016 --> 01:00:34.822
It's my baby.

01:00:34.922 --> 01:00:39.859
So when you came here, you didn't even expect that this would be the... No, and I was not.

01:00:40.922 --> 01:00:43.952
I just started working computers.

01:00:44.294 --> 01:00:45.658
Were you enthusiastic about it?
