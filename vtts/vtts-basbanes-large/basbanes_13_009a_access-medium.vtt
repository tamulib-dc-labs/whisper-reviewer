WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:04.212
pronounce your name, Professor.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.254
Okay.

00:08.157 --> 00:26.781
And, you know, one of the things that Edward Kasanek told me at the New York Public Library is that during the Soviet period there was this attempt by the Soviet government to really have the appearance of one library, one kind of book culture.

00:27.301 --> 00:32.468
Is that a fair statement that maybe with all these nationalities that we have

00:32.920 --> 00:45.031
in Eastern Europe, but I know, for instance, that a lot of the Ukrainian books and manuscripts were taken out of the Ukraine and brought to Moscow or, say, Petersburg.

00:45.051 --> 00:47.193
Does that make any sense at all?

00:47.313 --> 01:02.387
Yeah, well, to the degree that the Soviet system and wherever it was implemented in East Central European countries was based on centralization of authority and centralization of

01:03.160 --> 01:09.628
centralized control over and direction toward all aspects of life.

01:10.409 --> 01:31.075
Within that context, production of anything, including books, was ostensibly directed by centralized state audiences.

01:31.831 --> 02:00.488
and uh and at the same time libraries were also under the direction of centralized state organs or libraries or a live national library and so from that standpoint clearly there was a greater degree of control and even direction as to

02:00.957 --> 02:29.091
what was published and for most of the Soviet period as well as for most of the communist period in East Central Europe this was a time that before the recent technological revolution which

02:29.611 --> 02:58.251
now make it possible for anyone to be a publisher and and being in a in an older technological mode the only way primarily the way that books got published was through line of pipe machines and an old industry and these kinds of

02:59.125 --> 03:05.495
instruments were carefully controlled by the state.

03:05.855 --> 03:28.609
In those particular countries where the government was especially nervous about the spread of uncontrolled information, it could go so far that you would have to have them commit to have a typewriter.

03:28.960 --> 03:35.148
Sure, Albania being the example of this, so... Oh, yes, definitely.

03:35.448 --> 03:38.792
Oh, in Albania, yes.

03:38.893 --> 03:45.140
So, I mean, that's the extreme that it could have gone.

03:45.180 --> 03:55.153
But the point was that information in any form, and here we're talking about in the printed form,

03:55.893 --> 04:01.081
was clearly the control of, under the control of the state.

04:01.883 --> 04:06.249
As a result of that, one can talk about a unified book culture.

04:06.650 --> 04:18.209
I guess what I'm driving at, was there, did the Soviet form, did they discourage the sense of a national memory?

04:18.349 --> 04:19.150
You know, I mean,

04:26.335 --> 04:46.862
as an example of... No, not only did they not... The Soviet system not only did not discourage a sense of a national memory, on the contrary, it probably put as much effort, but not only the Soviet... We'll talk about all the individual, I think, here.

04:46.882 --> 04:47.503
Exactly.

04:47.744 --> 04:49.866
They encouraged it, in your view?

04:49.886 --> 04:50.648
Absolutely.

04:52.550 --> 04:54.773
They not only...

04:55.225 --> 05:17.580
When I'm talking about the Soviet system, we're talking about the Soviet Union, which was comprised of 17 republics, and then we're talking about those countries in East Central Europe that followed, to a greater or lesser degree, Soviet model.

05:19.242 --> 05:23.629
And again, I will repeat, not only did they not discourage

05:24.284 --> 05:42.152
a sense of a national memory, they encouraged, and probably encouraged as much as any society, one might argue even more so than any society, the recreation of a historical memory.

05:42.212 --> 05:43.794
That is the difference.

05:44.595 --> 05:49.583
The very basis for the existence of these systems

05:50.440 --> 05:55.344
was the fact that they were embedded in a historical process.

05:56.926 --> 06:09.157
The communist regimes, the worker states, based on Marxist ideology, were the ultimate achievement of historical evolution.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.038
In their view.

06:10.838 --> 06:20.447
Well, and as the ultimate achievement in historical evolution, it was incumbent upon them

06:21.052 --> 06:37.971
to continually remind those citizens over whom they had control, many of whom they got control over them unwillingly, of this historical reality from their perspective.

06:38.071 --> 06:49.303
And the way to justify that historical reality was to rewrite the historical records.

06:49.672 --> 07:03.404
So this was not by any means a system that was trying to do away with historical memory, but it was a system that was trying to redefine historical memory.

07:03.744 --> 07:05.245
That's the difference.

07:05.265 --> 07:19.257
So every time it is true, they may have deliberately forgotten certain historical events, certain historical figures who may not have

07:19.692 --> 07:39.062
easily fit into their framework that would allow for a justification of the present system, and calling such people reactionaries or events unimportant, or as Trotsky said, relegated to the dustbin of history.

07:40.164 --> 07:43.489
So yes, in certain instances,

07:43.587 --> 07:46.571
Who was Trotsky talking about when he talked about it?

07:46.591 --> 07:57.426
He was talking about those forces that were not part of the... That's a very key core.

07:57.666 --> 07:58.708
Yeah, sure.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.773
His context is probably worthwhile to take another look at it.

08:02.853 --> 08:03.394
Right, exactly.

08:03.414 --> 08:11.485
He was referring to those figures and those events in history that seemingly not to have importance because they did not have an effect on the outcome

08:11.718 --> 08:15.663
of a present communist regime.

08:16.124 --> 08:33.628
But what I want to say, just to finish this point, every time an event or persons were removed from history, they then found new events, created new events, and blew them out of proportion, usually.

08:34.229 --> 08:37.033
Every tiny little protest

08:37.385 --> 08:42.712
that someone would write a letter was suddenly transformed into a major revolt.

08:43.233 --> 08:45.416
We see this on historical maps.

08:45.476 --> 09:06.885
If you look at historical maps that were produced for classrooms or for general consumption in the Soviet Union, you will always see these little red flags or these little red flames, dots all over maps, showing that in the 19th century, all over...

09:07.102 --> 09:08.123
a territory.

09:08.143 --> 09:10.627
There were workers' protests, for instance.

09:10.647 --> 09:21.502
Those workers' protests, as I said, could range from a true strike to a true revolt to two or three people holding out the placard or writing a letter.

09:21.903 --> 09:24.226
But this was rewriting history.

09:24.727 --> 09:31.236
Those workers' revolts were much more important than some statement or book

09:31.486 --> 09:47.785
by some intellectual that was concerned with building a nation-state that wasn't socialist in orientation, or that was related to the aristocracy, or something that was not fitting into the framework.

09:47.806 --> 09:51.129
So by no means were they destroying it, on the contrary.

09:51.470 --> 09:59.940
And we have books upon books, of course, and we have books upon books, and encyclopedias and guidebooks about biographies

10:00.241 --> 10:17.348
of totally irrelevant, not totally irrelevant, because no one's totally irrelevant, but significantly unimportant figures, and they're in these biographical dictionaries simply because they were communists or left-wing sympathizers or whatever.

10:17.829 --> 10:24.139
Can you think of any English-language books that might enlighten me on this?

10:24.159 --> 10:26.923
Any studies that address what you're talking about right now?

10:31.223 --> 10:32.144
It's in background.

10:36.170 --> 10:36.830
Well, think about it.

10:36.911 --> 10:40.956
I'll call you, but maybe you can come up with a couple of things that might help me.

10:41.557 --> 10:48.827
I'm certainly interested in, I noticed, are those books about libraries that you have right here in the description of Ukraine, for instance?

10:48.847 --> 10:50.489
Is that a book about the country?

10:51.270 --> 10:58.159
One of the things Edward mentioned is that one of the things during the Soviet period that was not

11:04.383 --> 11:12.737
and you mentioned Ukraine in particular, how central manuscripts and documents, very precious items, were brought to the center.

11:13.599 --> 11:18.307
And in fact, a lot of these places are seeking repatriation, at least.

11:18.647 --> 11:24.637
Is this something that you know about, or do you agree with Edward on that?

11:24.657 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, well, yes.

11:26.020 --> 11:30.407
Was there a centralization of the memory into when

11:30.657 --> 11:31.939
Yes, there was.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.843
It would have been part of that process of redefining that you thought.

11:34.963 --> 11:35.523
Yeah, there was.

11:35.704 --> 11:53.267
I think, you know, we're talking about much of what I just said when you ask about books on the subject, I can't think of any immediately offhand because much of what I just said at one level was common knowledge.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.415
The history

12:01.505 --> 12:04.469
was an instrument of the state.

12:07.894 --> 12:30.145
History and the teaching of history was of extreme importance because it allowed for if done according to guidelines of the party it justified the existence

12:30.547 --> 12:32.370
of the present regimes.

12:33.491 --> 12:54.962
Now, in a sense, what the Soviets were doing, wherever they were, was not really any different than any other state that has to justify its existence.

12:55.182 --> 12:59.288
We also know the quip that history is written by the winners.

12:59.555 --> 13:10.992
So when a war ends, the way the war is interpreted, the received knowledge, is basically that of the victor.

13:11.673 --> 13:15.919
Just look at Shakespeare's historical place, and you can tell.

13:16.019 --> 13:22.569
So, I mean, this is not something that is unique to Soviet society.

13:23.210 --> 13:28.718
It is present in every society, including so-called democratic societies,

13:29.187 --> 13:35.053
as those in North America or Western Europe, just as much as anyone do they do this.

13:35.673 --> 13:39.617
Usually, in our systems, it takes the following form.

13:39.997 --> 13:47.024
It's a bit more complex and a bit more diffuse, but it does take the following form in the school system.

13:47.484 --> 13:56.393
School systems are always the most crucial aspects of any society because it's through the school system that one pervades

13:56.744 --> 13:59.248
the common historical memory.

14:00.389 --> 14:02.392
It's not through scholarly monographs.

14:02.492 --> 14:04.695
It's how that information gets watered down.

14:06.057 --> 14:25.705
And I think what's very important to note that in particular, in particular with regard to history, though this occurred perhaps in other disciplines as well, but in particular with regard to history in former Soviet Union and East Central Europe,

14:26.782 --> 14:55.084
no books on history, especially those that were for mass consumption, whether large popular works or school textbooks in particular, was ever allowed to be published unless it went through numerous committees in which all questions of whether the proper ideological emphasis was being

14:55.638 --> 14:56.940
drawn or stated.

14:57.741 --> 15:07.974
And then after the experts finished, then it had to go through to the ideological center.

15:07.994 --> 15:22.472
I mean, every one of these systems had people who read it and made sure that it coincided with the party directors.

15:22.908 --> 15:28.496
whether those party directors were within Moscow or within each of the republics.

15:28.516 --> 15:47.745
Only difference is that if you were in a republic, the Ukrainian Republic or the Estonian Republic, its own experts would approve a text, then it would go to the ideological expert in the particular republic, but then that one always, always had to think, well, what will Moscow?

15:50.048 --> 15:51.210
Am I violating...

15:51.410 --> 15:52.872
what Moscow would think.

15:52.892 --> 15:55.194
So it was just another step.

15:55.214 --> 15:58.438
But it was basically the same kind of situation.

15:58.818 --> 16:06.167
And once again, this is not unique to the Soviet system.

16:06.187 --> 16:11.493
Probably the closest analogy to the Soviet system is the Roman Catholic Church.

16:11.513 --> 16:20.843
There is not one book that is used within the Roman Catholic Church ever that does not have a printed imprimatur from a bishop.

16:21.869 --> 16:22.851
Now, what does that mean?

16:24.013 --> 16:38.937
That means that it had to be approved by that bishop and or his ideological expert before it is allowed to be disseminated amongst the faithful.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.823
Because, God forbid, if there is something... This continues to be the case?

16:42.843 --> 16:43.124
Absolutely.

16:44.045 --> 16:44.887
Absolutely.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.251
They did give you the index, right?

16:47.832 --> 16:48.653
No, they didn't.

16:49.139 --> 16:50.521
There's still things on the index.

16:50.541 --> 17:08.161
That is just a specific... And God forbid... Yeah, God forbid that there would be something in those books that were not in accord with accepted Catholic practice.

17:08.181 --> 17:10.984
Then you would be committing heresy.

17:12.066 --> 17:18.353
In that case... As an individual, as a lay person, or are you talking about people within the church?

17:20.155 --> 17:42.419
a person, if there would be something in a book, in a book produced by, this is very analogous to the Soviet system, if there would be something in a book of catechism, catechism is the basic rules or guides to belief.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.344
So, if that book did not go through proper control

17:47.695 --> 18:02.428
and receive the informator from a bishop who is responsible for a given area and is responsible for protecting the souls of his flock.

18:03.329 --> 18:08.754
So if there is something in that book that, who knows?

18:08.854 --> 18:15.340
Someone sneaks in and says, well, it's possible to, you know, it's possible under certain conditions to have an abortion.

18:15.877 --> 18:16.578
That's right.

18:16.598 --> 18:20.564
Well, I mean, this is against the teachings of the Catholic Church.

18:20.704 --> 18:24.129
It's against taking the life of an individual.

18:24.370 --> 18:27.254
A priest probably should be allowed to have a life.

18:27.274 --> 18:27.875
Whatever.

18:28.135 --> 18:28.716
Whatever.

18:28.896 --> 18:33.063
All such things could get snuck into text one way or another.

18:33.523 --> 18:44.179
Well, and if that got snuck into a text, and if then it gets printed, and then the faithful read it, they are now committing heresy in the eyes of the Church,

18:44.159 --> 18:52.608
They are sinners, they cannot be saved, or they, or whatever, and this now is being promoted by someone within the church, you see?

18:53.809 --> 19:04.780
So by the same token, if you were in the Soviet Union... I have to see if that's still really... Paul LeClaire, who's the president of the New York Public Library, told me an interesting story.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.464
He went to Holy Cross College in Washington, which is a Jesuit school.

19:08.484 --> 19:11.487
And we're talking the 60s, he's about my age.

19:12.468 --> 19:13.609
He actually had to...

19:13.690 --> 19:19.055
write the bishop for permission to read Rousseau, Voltaire, Revelé.

19:19.336 --> 19:22.139
And they wrote back and they gave permission.

19:22.199 --> 19:24.681
But he actually, so he wouldn't be committed.

19:24.861 --> 19:31.588
And the Jesuit teacher also had to write for permission to be able to discuss these books in his class.

19:31.949 --> 19:37.654
There is still an index, to the best of my knowledge, but I'm talking about two different things here.

19:37.674 --> 19:39.096
I mean, there are two different things.

19:39.416 --> 19:43.140
One is the need, and this is absolute,

19:43.812 --> 19:49.577
are in present publications within the Roman Catholic Church to have an imprimatur of a bishop.

19:51.379 --> 19:58.465
The other thing is, is books that already exist, whether published by the Church or not published by the Church, that are somehow potentially dangerous to the faithful.

19:58.825 --> 20:01.808
So we're talking about books and books through history.

20:01.828 --> 20:03.489
Yeah, these are two different things.

20:04.130 --> 20:11.997
The index is basically a review and

20:12.162 --> 20:17.170
an identification of dangerous things, no matter what those things are.

20:18.131 --> 20:30.170
The other stuff is simply new stuff that is being produced by and in which the organization is concerned with its ideological purity.

20:30.370 --> 20:34.937
And from that standpoint, direct analogy with Soviet system.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.566
Soviet system, whether it was in the Soviet Union or whether it was a

20:41.069 --> 20:44.834
similar system in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or anywhere.

20:45.495 --> 20:58.191
All of these, and so therefore, in that context related to your question of collection of documents or other things and centralizing them, it's all related.

20:58.671 --> 21:07.963
Because in order to produce a common ideological script, you have to have control of the data.

21:08.884 --> 21:10.907
Not anyone should be allowed to

21:11.444 --> 21:32.116
have access to documents that somehow might be in violation of what the party has decided, what the government has decided, to be the acceptable body of knowledge that people should have.

21:32.837 --> 21:32.957
Right.

21:32.977 --> 21:38.566
Of course, during the Soviet period, books and libraries were there to serve as an instrument of the state.

21:39.367 --> 21:39.527
Correct.

21:39.980 --> 21:45.985
And so, what I'm interested in now is the dramatic, dramatic change that this has happened.

21:46.005 --> 21:58.576
Of course, they're not getting the funds, but they're actually having to come around and raise money, and they're becoming libraries like, you know, you and I know, this library across the street.

21:58.596 --> 22:01.459
Do you agree with this?

22:01.479 --> 22:05.983
Yeah, well, I think the dramatic change that is taking place is basically the following.

22:06.423 --> 22:08.485
Every regime...

22:09.292 --> 22:16.720
Every ruling power, in some way, tries to manipulate knowledge.

22:21.385 --> 22:36.582
And depending on the period of time, it's really only in the 20th century, where you approach the possibility through mass communication.

22:37.540 --> 22:39.963
to control the way people think.

22:43.247 --> 23:06.957
Probably as controlled as anybody are the masses of population in the United States and in Canada whose knowledge of the world is based on snippets that come over television, on the news,

23:07.595 --> 23:17.949
either the evening news, so-called international news, which is not international, network news, or on your late news program.

23:17.969 --> 23:28.103
I mean, what we know about the world is what is packaged for us in entertainment shows called news programs.

23:29.465 --> 23:35.593
So what I'm describing here is not a function simply of what we would call

23:36.097 --> 23:38.079
classic totalitarian societies.

23:42.284 --> 23:46.529
But that is possible only really, that was only possible in the 20th century.

23:47.109 --> 24:04.028
But even, even in those societies that have tried to control and manipulate knowledge amongst the vast majority of its citizens, and have gone out and tried to erase

24:04.430 --> 24:33.205
certain aspects of the historical memory in their in their recreation process not in their erasing but in their recreation to erase certain aspects of it even to the degree of destroying cemeteries or you know disinterning bodies this has happened as well because you wanted to get rid of memory even in the 20th century no system has been able to succeed in this activity

24:33.607 --> 24:55.537
historical memory, after all, rests in the minds of individuals, and it is passed on not only through books, but through oral tradition, just as it had been passed on through oral tradition in the time of the Homer, the Iliad, and the Odyssey, etc.

24:55.957 --> 24:56.238
Right?

24:56.658 --> 25:02.466
In many ways, aspects of modern 20th century societies return to...

25:02.986 --> 25:12.621
to prehistorical days in which information and historical memory of events of individuals was passed on verbally.

25:14.003 --> 25:24.960
So there was always an awareness that somewhere out there there was information that we were not getting through our official channels, if you will.

25:25.548 --> 25:34.916
And certainly if someone became a little bit more intellectually inclined, immediately they would know that what they read was not the full story.

25:36.077 --> 25:55.234
And so now when those ideological controls have been removed as a result of the fall of the Soviet Union and fall of communism in East Central Europe, there has been a flood of people who are desperate for...

25:55.383 --> 26:05.796
trying to get concrete knowledge about those events and individuals who they had a vague memory of.

26:06.016 --> 26:08.960
And how are they satisfying this?

26:08.980 --> 26:10.682
They're satisfying it?

26:13.465 --> 26:24.799
The first way they have done it, the very immediate way that it was done, concretely, was to reprint, and now technology makes it possible,

26:25.235 --> 26:26.536
All the old books.

26:28.198 --> 26:29.199
Where were all the old books?

26:29.219 --> 26:31.201
The old books, and that's another thing.

26:33.042 --> 26:38.347
The Soviet system, in general, no, there was exceptions.

26:38.367 --> 26:41.310
The Soviet system never destroyed things.

26:41.330 --> 26:42.311
They kept everything.

26:43.552 --> 26:45.594
They may have kept it under lock and key.

26:46.135 --> 26:51.220
Every library had what is known as a special collection.

26:51.240 --> 26:51.580
I can spell that.

26:51.813 --> 26:54.516
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

26:54.776 --> 26:57.579
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.421
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

26:59.441 --> 27:00.502
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:00.923 --> 27:01.804
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:01.984 --> 27:02.685
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:02.765 --> 27:07.770
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:08.651 --> 27:09.132
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:09.612 --> 27:11.615
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:11.935 --> 27:16.300
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.521
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.504
S-P-E-T-S-F-O-N-D.

27:20.885 --> 27:21.145
S-P-E-T-

27:21.530 --> 27:34.365
that the only people who could read them who were those who had special permission or who were writing ideological or historical tracts against them, right?

27:35.186 --> 27:37.689
But they were closed, it was restricted.

27:39.571 --> 27:41.994
So, the stuff was never thrown away.

27:42.014 --> 27:43.576
Do you have first-hand knowledge of this?

27:43.636 --> 27:47.240
Oh, sure, this is common knowledge.

27:47.300 --> 27:48.782
Everyone knows this.

27:48.962 --> 27:50.524
I mean, in this part of the world, it's this.

27:51.685 --> 27:54.049
I believe everyone knows it was a normal thing.

27:54.189 --> 27:59.096
And besides, I know historians who actually worked in Spets Fundy.

27:59.617 --> 28:12.597
And those Westerners, when we came there during the detente period in the 60s and 70s, when these exchange programs existed, as the only

28:13.015 --> 28:27.671
We were allowed to use material, because we knew about the existence of material, and we would ask for publications, usually not archival material, but publications that were not available for the general public, but we could get them because we weren't the general public.

28:28.412 --> 28:33.278
And they came from these special funds, special collections.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.038
This is normal.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.021
This is normal.

28:36.081 --> 28:42.228
And by the way, by the way, by the way, you know, we have spets funds in this library.

28:42.248 --> 28:42.668
Oh, sure.

28:43.272 --> 28:48.880
And on also every library, certainly in the 40s and 50s, I mean, it's not like the Catholic Church.

28:48.920 --> 29:08.669
We were beyond the Catholic Church in terms of being able to read Rousseau, but we certainly couldn't read Lady Chatterley's Lover for a long time, and I would imagine that the story of O is probably still locked up somewhere as well because of sadomasochism.

29:09.009 --> 29:10.191
You think so?

29:10.211 --> 29:11.473
Oh, it's without question.

29:11.858 --> 29:19.790
Well, I can tell you, when I was an undergraduate at Rutgers and at Princeton, there was special collections.

29:22.213 --> 29:24.076
Well, I mean, everybody has special collections.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.079
That's how you define the word special, I guess.

29:26.099 --> 29:35.993
Here was limiting access to people because of the content of the book, not because of its rarity that you didn't want people destroying it.

29:39.584 --> 29:42.829
Definition of words special takes out a new context, doesn't it?

29:43.129 --> 29:43.810
Absolutely.

29:45.292 --> 29:56.168
And so the first thing in terms of this explosion of access to former knowledge was to... What did you call it?

29:56.188 --> 29:57.109
Former knowledge?

29:57.630 --> 30:04.841
Yeah, well, yeah, what I meant was to... That's interesting.

30:04.881 --> 30:05.862
Like I went into...

30:06.095 --> 30:06.796
Hibernation.

30:08.437 --> 30:14.223
To reprint books that haven't been available for a long time.

30:14.723 --> 30:31.920
And if you walk the streets of the former Soviet Union today, you can still see in many of the kiosks that sell books on the street, reprints of things from before World War I. Like very recent reprints.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.841
Absolutely.

30:32.861 --> 30:34.523
In the last two or three years, yes.

30:34.883 --> 30:35.764
Absolutely.

30:35.930 --> 30:57.385
And again, you have to remember, if you travel there, some of the most popular books are books of history and of literature, because a lot of literary works and writers were banned as well.

30:58.386 --> 30:59.368
How about Western stuff?

30:59.388 --> 31:03.034
I understand that they have a pretty good, strong interest.

31:03.352 --> 31:16.650
Oh, well, they've always had an interest in cultures from other parts of the world, but for the longest time, only certain authors were permitted.

31:16.711 --> 31:30.810
Those authors that were, you know, left-wing sympathizers, or those that described the underside of American or capitalist life, so third-rate writers like Erskine Caldwell and...

31:31.010 --> 31:39.078
Some of these others were really big sellers in the Soviet Union, but the readers knew that there was other kind of literature as well.

31:39.819 --> 31:44.804
Tell me a little bit what Ukrainian Studies is, which was the department you're sharing here.

31:46.826 --> 31:50.931
Ukrainian Studies is... Excuse me, one second.

31:51.611 --> 31:57.017
I thought I'd...

32:00.845 --> 32:16.120
various disciplines that are concerned with the study of the territory of Ukraine and Ukrainian culture.

32:17.141 --> 32:24.869
So Ukrainian studies can include Ukrainian history, Ukrainian literature, Ukrainian language.

32:25.550 --> 32:26.751
It's straightforward.

32:27.153 --> 32:38.528
In this particular case, I hold a professorship of Ukrainian, literally called Ukrainian studies, though in effect it's Ukrainian history.

32:39.529 --> 32:47.380
I teach Ukrainian history, just like one would have German studies, Germanic studies, or Italian studies, or whatever.

32:47.540 --> 32:55.110
Is the Ukraine a political, what are the boundaries of Ukraine in the context of how you teach it?

32:55.771 --> 32:56.552
Could you give me a

32:57.190 --> 33:02.699
a sense of what you cover in terms of scope?

33:02.719 --> 33:03.820
Physically, geographically.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.361
Yeah, okay.

33:04.381 --> 33:08.107
Well, I'm surprised by the question.

33:08.127 --> 33:12.133
No, I... It doesn't reflect ignorance, by the way.

33:12.153 --> 33:12.514
No, no.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.699
It's just, you know, is it strictly the Ukraine?

33:15.719 --> 33:16.720
I know the Ukraine.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.844
Then that's the... Yes.

33:19.505 --> 33:20.086
Okay.

33:20.146 --> 33:20.987
Very simple.

33:21.608 --> 33:35.808
I mean, you mentioned something earlier about Albanians, so you don't really sneak off into Albania for... Well, me as an individual and me as a scholar, I mean, I don't just simply write about Ukraine.

33:36.609 --> 33:44.640
I happen to write about other things in the world, including the Monegosk or Malta or Luxembourg.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.663
I've published in all of these areas.

33:47.344 --> 33:50.028
That's because of my particular interest.

33:50.048 --> 33:50.248
Sure.

33:50.414 --> 34:03.291
And one of the things that I have done, a major work that I have done, is a historical atlas of East Central Europe, which has specific chapters on book culture, by the way.

34:03.331 --> 34:18.712
And so I'll just show you what we've probably done.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.134
I can have this?

34:20.485 --> 34:23.050
Can I have this brochure?

34:23.390 --> 34:28.619
Yeah, you can take that.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.601
It's quite reasonable.

34:29.621 --> 34:31.084
It's exactly the same thing.

34:31.104 --> 34:33.308
It's just the paper's the same.

34:33.969 --> 34:39.999
So here, for instance, is on education and printing.

34:40.801 --> 34:40.941
Mm-hmm.

34:41.225 --> 34:46.273
So you can see the evolution of printing and the discussion of book culture in this part of the world.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.015
That's an essential thing.

34:48.035 --> 34:50.499
Yeah, this is what you want to begin with.

34:50.519 --> 34:51.160
Okay, great.

34:51.401 --> 35:04.400
And this is... And this is... I can give you... That's great.

35:04.821 --> 35:06.844
You have to... Forgive me, this was put together...

35:08.275 --> 35:11.979
You know, usually I'm much better prepared for that.

35:11.999 --> 35:14.321
Edward just proposed this about three days ago.

35:14.341 --> 35:16.784
I called you the day this came together.

35:16.804 --> 35:18.305
He said, you're going to be in Toronto.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.467
I must talk to you.

35:20.107 --> 35:21.769
And I'm glad he suggested it.

35:21.889 --> 35:24.372
I understand you're something of a bibliophile as well.

35:24.392 --> 35:28.376
I mean, do you, in terms of books?

35:28.396 --> 35:37.405
Well, yeah, I, yes, I am,

35:38.937 --> 35:42.642
And in fact, I have a piece which you probably will find of interest.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.124
Let me see if I have a copy of it.

35:45.025 --> 36:08.117
I have done a lot of bibliographies and descriptions of libraries, specifically as they are related to my area of specialty, which is either Ukraine or a...

36:08.857 --> 36:18.369
a small people in East Central Europe, and there I have done catalogs of books.

36:18.549 --> 36:30.504
I'm in the process of producing a kind of mini national bibliography, which, so it's in that sense, so I'll show you with some of that.

36:31.145 --> 36:35.390
And you said that you have a copy of an essay that you wrote?

36:35.410 --> 36:38.053
Yes, I'm going to skip that, because that I...

36:38.759 --> 36:41.942
of this kind of national bibliography.

36:41.962 --> 36:47.927
The second volume is now in its latter stages.

36:49.268 --> 36:59.958
This is an example of a catalog of all Ukrainian-related materials, two volumes, 2,000 pages.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.261
These are all yours.

37:04.182 --> 37:07.585
Yeah, well, I'm working together.

37:19.006 --> 37:20.829
Oh, you get it?

37:20.849 --> 37:21.229
Yeah.

37:21.390 --> 37:33.348
Oh, well, then it was published—I thought I had a— If you have it, if you have an off-print, that would be great.

37:33.368 --> 37:39.939
Well, that's what I was looking for, and I don't have an off-print, but as minimally I can give you the— You can just cite it for me, I guess.

37:40.019 --> 37:47.190
The point, or the— Because I thought I had the whole thing here, but I don't know.

37:47.508 --> 37:49.932
You know, it's incredible.

37:51.454 --> 37:52.976
Is it within the last five years?

37:54.178 --> 37:59.886
Yeah, I just had to... I don't have... Can you believe it?

38:00.086 --> 38:03.751
I don't have a goddamn... Oh, wait a minute.

38:03.772 --> 38:05.093
Theography.

38:05.254 --> 38:08.799
What I published.

38:08.819 --> 38:09.860
Terrible.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.282
This was in the 70s.

38:11.302 --> 38:13.145
And this is a good piece, actually.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.207
No, I'll get it.

38:14.227 --> 38:16.570
I'll get it.

38:17.208 --> 38:20.552
Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.

38:20.772 --> 38:22.654
Here it is.

38:22.674 --> 38:26.558
Lo and behold, it would be on a... It was even reprinted in the Harvard series.

38:26.578 --> 38:29.722
Look at that.

38:29.742 --> 38:40.193
It's called Nationalism and National Bibliography, and it does a comparative analysis of varying bibliographical works through every country in Europe.

38:40.213 --> 38:41.174
Yeah, that's important.

38:41.314 --> 38:41.875
It's contextual.

38:43.176 --> 38:46.860
And I'll... I'll feel after that.

38:47.077 --> 38:47.618
Terrific.

38:57.151 --> 39:08.125
You point out here, and I was just reading this Journal of Ukrainian Studies, looking at it, and you talk about the importance, of course, of materials, of research materials.

39:08.146 --> 39:14.434
And we were talking, you know, the other interviews I was doing here.

39:15.427 --> 39:21.916
If you're going to be recognized as a great university, I mean, one way to really measure this is by the numbers of books that you have, isn't it?

39:21.956 --> 39:25.141
It's almost like putting your chips on the table, I guess.

39:25.161 --> 39:32.091
If you want to be regarded as the best and the greatest in Canada, you have to have 10 million books.

39:34.955 --> 39:39.622
Is that a preposterous statement, or do you agree with that just on its face?

39:39.642 --> 39:40.263
Totally agree.

39:41.104 --> 39:44.809
And would you say that the...

39:45.143 --> 39:48.246
Do they have, obviously you've done a bibliography of materials here.

39:48.266 --> 39:49.608
Are the materials strong here?

39:51.770 --> 39:56.715
Yeah, I went to the point that they attract serious scholars and generate scholarship.

39:56.735 --> 39:57.797
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:57.817 --> 40:04.184
I would say that this is one of the ten top libraries in North America.

40:04.264 --> 40:11.151
It's the only one in Canada, but it's one of the, I would say, one of the ten best in North America.

40:11.435 --> 40:21.325
It is relatively strong in East Central Europe and the former Soviet Union.

40:21.345 --> 40:22.326
And how does that happen?

40:22.426 --> 40:27.010
I mean, does the faculty say we have to get certain materials?

40:27.030 --> 40:28.452
Do they give you a budget for this?

40:28.892 --> 40:37.000
Are they supportive in your... Yeah, I'm dancing around a subject.

40:37.060 --> 40:37.601
Yeah, sure.

40:37.621 --> 40:38.682
How does it happen?

40:39.102 --> 40:39.923
Very often...

40:40.223 --> 41:08.340
are great collections and there are books about Widener Library which kind of which kind of underlie what I'm about to say very often great collections grow somewhat serendipitously let me give you an example a a former

41:09.890 --> 41:20.181
A colleague of mine at Harvard, Carl Deutsch, who's a specialist in the history of nationalism, well known.

41:22.744 --> 41:33.035
He used to tell this story when he was writing his book on nationalism.

41:35.478 --> 41:39.222
Before that, he did an article for World Politics, I believe,

41:40.197 --> 42:08.668
varying peoples of Europe, and in connection with that, traveled to varying places, and wound up in the town called Hur, C-H-U-R, in eastern Switzerland, which is the cultural capital of the Romant, or the Retoromant, which is a small minority of people, because they are official people,

42:09.222 --> 42:12.506
Switzerland doesn't have three peoples, it has four.

42:12.526 --> 42:21.236
One of these is the Reto-Roman, there's about 50,000 of them in the far eastern part of the country, and Khur is their cultural center.

42:21.256 --> 42:36.715
And so, while he was there, he was visiting various libraries, and one man was very proud and brought him to this library in Khur, where he pointed out and said that this is the

42:37.488 --> 42:49.144
you're standing in one of the richest collections of retro-romanche books you're going to find anywhere.

42:50.927 --> 42:52.209
But it's not the richest.

42:52.429 --> 42:58.638
The richest collection is at Widener Library in Cambridge.

42:58.658 --> 43:03.985
And that's because somebody in the 20s or 30s

43:04.235 --> 43:13.205
no, excuse me, in this case, no, no, it was before World War I, was interested in this area and simply collected it all, right?

43:13.225 --> 43:16.709
And then it was a professor's university and then gave it to them.

43:16.729 --> 43:17.570
Which happens often.

43:17.791 --> 43:18.732
Which happens often.

43:18.752 --> 43:26.921
So from that standpoint... But this professor had a collection that exceeded the one that was... Yes, exactly, exactly, exactly.

43:26.941 --> 43:27.722
And that happens.

43:28.263 --> 43:31.947
And it occurs...

43:32.348 --> 43:55.956
And so a lot of these great collections evolve because there are individual professors at the university who become interested in a specific area and then when they die or during their lives they donate their collections to the library.

43:59.060 --> 44:00.702
Mixed with that are

44:01.137 --> 44:29.177
the university, for whatever reason, decides to specialize in some parts of the world, and therefore you bring in new professors who are specialists who then enrich that collection either by giving their own stuff or by requesting the library to purchase stuff because they're teaching in that area, which libraries usually do.

44:29.297 --> 44:29.457
If one

44:29.825 --> 44:33.949
It's very rare that a professor will ask the library to get something, and the library will not.

44:34.150 --> 44:35.191
It almost always does.

44:35.951 --> 44:54.030
So, in that sense, certain parts of the world may have very rich collections that... And the University of Toronto is not bad in East Central Europe.

44:54.050 --> 44:55.111
And again, why?

44:55.632 --> 44:58.515
Because of the specific nature of

44:59.187 --> 45:18.615
of Canada is that the federal government about 20, 30 years ago started allotting money, matching money with community organizations that were interested in endowing university chairs that are in their cultures.

45:18.635 --> 45:22.600
So the University of Toronto is actually unique in North America.

45:22.780 --> 45:28.789
It's the only place where there are endowed chairs in

45:29.377 --> 45:33.804
as an example, Hungarian, Estonian, and Finnish.

45:34.365 --> 45:38.212
Now, this is the Finno-Ugric group.

45:38.272 --> 45:38.913
It's rare.

45:38.953 --> 45:46.305
It's the only place in North America where you can study all three of these languages, Finno-Ugric languages.

45:46.420 --> 45:48.243
with people who are full-time specialists.

45:48.764 --> 45:50.167
And the materials are here.

45:50.367 --> 45:52.671
And so therefore, exactly.

45:52.711 --> 45:55.576
So now suddenly, you know, we've got Estonian stuff.

45:55.656 --> 45:58.481
I mean, where the hell are you going to find Estonian stuff in North America?

45:58.562 --> 46:01.787
Well, you will find it here because we happen to have an Estonian chair.

46:01.807 --> 46:05.294
And then besides that, we have a chair of Ukrainian studies.

46:05.935 --> 46:07.838
We already have a Ukrainian program.

46:08.206 --> 46:10.108
But the university is willing to buy the stuff.

46:10.128 --> 46:11.610
Yes, exactly.

46:11.650 --> 46:14.594
You don't find this at all places.

46:15.755 --> 46:20.281
And then, again, the university is willing to buy it.

46:20.521 --> 46:28.491
In this particular case, the chairs, when they were established, had a certain budget also that helped buy some material.

46:29.151 --> 46:32.175
Then you have individual donors who will endow collections.

46:32.255 --> 46:34.618
Just last week, this library...

46:34.919 --> 46:45.894
received a large endowment by some check to permanently endow the purchase of books dealing with checks and slow books.

46:45.914 --> 46:47.015
That's how these things happen.

46:47.356 --> 46:50.900
Edward mentioned something about emigre libraries that were set up.

46:52.022 --> 46:52.302
Yes.

46:52.442 --> 46:54.185
Are you familiar with that?

46:54.225 --> 46:58.270
And what was the genesis of that?

46:58.390 --> 47:00.833
Okay, the genesis of that was the following.

47:01.634 --> 47:04.318
You remember when I was talking about the

47:05.767 --> 47:35.470
a Soviet system and it's wanting to not destroy historical memory but refashion it but yet it even a totalitarian society was unable to control historical memory because it's embedded in individuals or physical either in their minds or their physical presence because a lot of these people fled their homelands

47:36.057 --> 47:55.281
and some of them brought books with them right uh or produced new literature wherever they lived not being under the control of a totalitarian state and perhaps even enter into some kind of

47:55.598 --> 47:58.522
surreptitious or stealthy way of getting more material.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.663
Oh, absolutely.

47:59.683 --> 48:00.824
Oh, absolutely.

48:00.844 --> 48:02.366
Of getting a pipeline.

48:02.386 --> 48:02.947
Absolutely.

48:02.967 --> 48:12.839
And how do you think some of the great literature of the 20th century from the Soviet Union, including Dr. Zhivago, I mean, being the outstanding one, but there's a whole host of them.

48:13.360 --> 48:13.720
Of course.

48:14.821 --> 48:24.373
So many of these peoples, in particular those that were under regimes that they perceived as denying them of freedom,

48:25.906 --> 48:37.418
established a whole host of cultural organizations to retain their historical cultural heritage in whatever land they lived.

48:39.039 --> 48:53.854
And certain communities, peoples that were stateless for a long time, built enormously important cultural institutions abroad.

48:54.087 --> 49:03.958
So, for instance, you know Poland existed in the 20th century, but it didn't exist in the 19th century.

49:04.339 --> 49:23.200
Poland was just an idea amongst some intellectuals, many of whom fled to Paris, and the most important library of Polish materials in the 19th century is not anywhere in Poland or anywhere in those countries that had controlled Poland, but in Paris.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.327
and some of the most important journals and publications.

49:27.347 --> 49:28.008
What's the name of it?

49:28.169 --> 49:29.932
That was called the Polish National Library.

49:29.972 --> 49:30.874
And it was in Paris?

49:30.974 --> 49:31.636
Yeah, of course.

49:31.656 --> 49:32.297
Is it still there?

49:33.099 --> 49:35.363
I don't know if the Polish one still is there.

49:35.664 --> 49:38.409
They certainly have publishing houses, Polish.

49:38.429 --> 49:40.273
I mean, this is a common phenomenon.

49:40.333 --> 49:43.039
So the Polish National Library, and it was in Paris.

49:43.099 --> 49:43.720
Exactly.

49:44.172 --> 49:45.293
Exactly.

49:46.214 --> 49:49.938
And this was... Well, there is a Polish National Library in Poland, too.

49:50.639 --> 49:58.087
But this, of course, existed in Paris in the 19th century, the greatest Polish writer of the 19th century, Adam Nitzkewicz.

49:58.107 --> 49:58.928
That's where he lived.

49:59.649 --> 50:00.049
But why?

50:00.309 --> 50:11.361
Why did they go... Well, in this particular case, because he was a Pole, and Poland was just occupied and destroyed in the late 18th century, and the Poles

50:11.560 --> 50:15.146
revolted twice against the Russian Empire in 1830 and 1863.

50:15.326 --> 50:17.429
That's a great historical story.

50:17.449 --> 50:30.669
Those revolts were put down, were put down, you know, with force, and as a result of that, many intellectuals and other people were forced to emigrate abroad.

50:30.890 --> 50:34.175
Is there a good book on this that you can recommend?

50:36.519 --> 50:36.859
Um...

50:37.733 --> 50:43.801
I guess I would begin by looking at the equivalent of my history of Ukraine, history of Poland.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.064
Well, there's a whole section on there.

50:46.084 --> 50:48.007
It's called Norman Davies.

50:48.387 --> 50:49.108
Okay.

50:49.128 --> 50:51.251
But what is this period called in Polish history?

50:51.311 --> 50:53.093
Oh, this is the 19th century.

50:53.694 --> 50:54.856
It's the 19th century.

50:54.876 --> 50:55.577
It doesn't have a name.

50:55.597 --> 50:56.338
It's not like the 30th century.

50:56.358 --> 50:59.321
Yeah, it's the period of time when Poland didn't exist.

50:59.622 --> 51:03.006
Poland didn't exist from 1795 until 1918.

51:03.207 --> 51:05.810
There was no country of Poland.

51:06.311 --> 51:06.992
What was it called?

51:07.012 --> 51:07.352
What was it?

51:07.855 --> 51:08.796
What was that area?

51:08.816 --> 51:16.406
It was divided between the three empires, Russia, Austria, and Prussia.

51:17.828 --> 51:19.790
It's known as the three partitions.

51:19.810 --> 51:20.872
That's a great story.

51:20.952 --> 51:22.354
The three partitions of Poland.

51:22.374 --> 51:28.902
Well, Poland became... Don't you understand that we Americans are really ignorant of the East and European history?

51:29.607 --> 51:30.308
Terribly.

51:30.689 --> 51:32.732
Yeah, well, that's true.

51:32.872 --> 51:37.360
However, in the case of Poland, it's somewhat a bit different.

51:37.400 --> 51:44.512
What I just described to you was written down in great detail by Voltaire already in the 18th century.

51:44.572 --> 51:50.562
So, I mean, this is not something that is beyond the pale of even Western knowledge.

51:50.582 --> 51:54.889
I'm not saying it's beyond the pale, but I think that we're kind of myopic about...

51:55.949 --> 52:23.627
Well, but again, also I would be somewhat surprised that even if any place in America, and certainly in American cities like New York, New York City is just filled and overflowing with Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian, Sikh, Kurd, name it, cultural centers, museums, libraries.

52:24.417 --> 52:45.868
evil the great center of yiddish culture is in new york city it is not in vilnius anymore where it was founded i mean it's you know america is just teaming with this stuff teaming why do you suppose that is why why new york city why well

52:47.215 --> 52:51.782
That sounds like a stupid question, but why not to London?

52:52.002 --> 53:01.516
I would say that I'm surprised that as an American, you're asking the question.

53:02.277 --> 53:03.619
No, but I want to hear your response.

53:03.679 --> 53:04.060
Okay.

53:05.522 --> 53:05.842
All right.

53:05.943 --> 53:06.644
Where do you live?

53:07.044 --> 53:08.146
Massachusetts.

53:08.166 --> 53:09.588
How was Massachusetts founded?

53:10.890 --> 53:11.751
How was it founded?

53:11.791 --> 53:14.455
Well, what's the West American mythology?

53:14.688 --> 53:17.190
The mythology is that the other pilgrims came.

53:17.210 --> 53:18.752
Yeah, stepped off on this rock.

53:18.772 --> 53:19.253
It's 1620.

53:19.373 --> 53:19.873
Right.

53:19.893 --> 53:21.194
Well, who were the pilgrims?

53:21.214 --> 53:21.955
Well, they were Brits.

53:21.975 --> 53:22.776
And what did they do?

53:23.937 --> 53:25.218
Why were they here?

53:26.179 --> 53:26.700
To escape.

53:27.120 --> 53:27.421
What?

53:28.181 --> 53:28.962
Persecution.

53:29.202 --> 53:30.684
For religious purposes.

53:30.824 --> 53:32.526
And what did they do when they came here?

53:32.866 --> 53:41.675
They set up institutions eventually to preserve their common historical heritage, which was different from the land that they fled from.

53:42.916 --> 53:44.037
There is hardly...

53:44.303 --> 53:46.265
America is that.

53:46.846 --> 53:50.130
In one sense, America is that and nothing else.

53:50.550 --> 53:55.496
So to ask the question, why did these people come to America and not somewhere else?

53:55.516 --> 53:58.439
Or why did they do what they did?

53:58.779 --> 53:59.921
Why did they do what they did?

53:59.961 --> 54:04.406
It's because almost that's what all America is about.

54:05.347 --> 54:07.429
And why certain centers and not others?

54:07.449 --> 54:09.231
Well, obviously cities.

54:09.363 --> 54:13.490
have always drawn, you know, and have been places of concentration.

54:13.791 --> 54:32.164
New York City happens to be this international emporium that has always drawn people from various parts of the world, and as we know just in terms of immigration pattern, that is where, it was the largest city in the United States, and also the place of entry for the longest period of time.

54:32.330 --> 54:37.778
But you have the same... Sure, you have the same thing on the West Coast in California.

54:37.978 --> 54:41.383
For the Asian... Exactly, exactly.

54:41.463 --> 54:47.833
And also, interestingly, for the Russians, because some Russians came from Siberia and from that part.

54:48.454 --> 54:54.242
I know these questions might sound naive and stupid, but they are... How did you get some quotation in front of me?

54:54.643 --> 54:57.206
No, no, you're provoking me well.

54:58.428 --> 55:01.172
And you're getting them, aren't you?

55:01.192 --> 55:01.813
I'm pleased that

55:02.603 --> 55:03.805
You know, take a look at my book.

55:03.985 --> 55:05.206
My book speaks for itself.

55:05.967 --> 55:09.672
When I write, it does come out pretty... I have to run.

55:09.692 --> 55:10.753
I'm going to catch an airplane.

55:11.414 --> 55:14.038
Is there anything else I want to do?

55:14.058 --> 55:15.239
Can I call you at some point?

55:15.259 --> 55:17.882
What I'd like to do is go back and transcribe the tape.

55:18.423 --> 55:19.164
Sure.

55:19.184 --> 55:20.245
Find some of these things.

55:20.305 --> 55:20.666
Sure.

55:20.686 --> 55:21.327
Look at them.

55:21.887 --> 55:25.752
And then, as they say, now we begin.

55:25.812 --> 55:30.198
The Multicultural History Society of Ontario.

55:30.238 --> 55:31.800
That's actually an institution.

55:32.236 --> 55:48.011
And it was established about 20 years ago, and its function is to collect archival material, publications, oral history, and publish books about the different peoples who live in Canada.

55:49.653 --> 55:51.234
All the peoples who live in Canada.

55:51.254 --> 55:57.680
And our major project at the moment is an encyclopedia of Canada's peoples, of which I'm the editor-in-chief.

55:57.700 --> 56:00.463
Maybe that can be the discussion of a telephone conversation.

56:00.483 --> 56:00.623
Fine.

56:01.075 --> 56:02.276
If you don't mind.

56:02.537 --> 56:03.538
When's the best time?

56:03.558 --> 56:04.239
Yeah, that's right.

56:04.259 --> 56:10.025
I was just going to say, right on the back of the card, on this card, Monday through Wednesdays.

56:11.547 --> 56:13.749
And at the chair.

56:14.470 --> 56:14.891
Meeting here?

56:15.051 --> 56:16.633
Yeah, Thursday and Friday, like today.

56:18.375 --> 56:19.676
Thursday and Friday at the chair.

56:19.996 --> 56:20.357
Okay.

56:21.879 --> 56:25.282
Monday and Wednesday, multicultural.

56:25.803 --> 56:26.404
How about time?

56:27.545 --> 56:29.207
Preferably the mornings.

56:29.227 --> 56:29.327
Okay.

56:30.607 --> 56:31.274
I'll give you a call.

56:31.294 --> 56:33.698
That's because you must have some...
