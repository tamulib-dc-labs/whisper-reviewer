WEBVTT

00:03.727 --> 00:14.395
That would be my fool's

00:14.712 --> 00:30.486
I spent a lot of time going to Jerusalem over the past about seven years now.

00:30.526 --> 00:43.858
And there isn't anything in the book that isn't based on something, I mean in terms of the big picture, not in terms of the lives of the individual, but in terms of the events, in terms of events,

00:44.142 --> 00:51.582
political events that take place, all of those are based on something that happened.

00:51.602 --> 00:59.282
I mean, whether it's some of the drug dealing, some of the supplying of Gaza Strip

00:59.633 --> 01:12.558
the irregulars with arms, all that stuff is pretty much based on, I mean, I've imagined my way into the details of some of it, but it's essentially based on reality.

01:12.638 --> 01:14.882
Now this is the fifth novel, I think.

01:15.023 --> 01:16.846
Is this the first time that you've met?

01:17.127 --> 01:18.149
This is the sixth.

01:18.349 --> 01:18.790
Is it the sixth?

01:18.955 --> 01:21.578
Sixth novel and seventh book, I guess.

01:21.598 --> 01:30.669
They were coming a lot quicker in recent years, which is... That's only sensible, yeah.

01:30.789 --> 01:44.625
Is this the first time you've actually used actual events to... No, I mean, you know, my first book was a kind of political flat fire, in a way, in the world, and so forth.

01:44.943 --> 02:02.277
And my second one is a Vietnam book, so there are a lot of those events in that work, again in terms of the big picture work, were true.

02:02.594 --> 02:06.701
I think that's generally true of Flag for Sunrise.

02:07.663 --> 02:19.945
Politics, I mean, when I write politics, I usually base it on political situations that are real.

02:20.870 --> 02:26.819
Could you, I mean, there are any number of different titles I think you could have picked for this book.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.663
Explain the particular pertinence of this one.

02:29.743 --> 02:34.590
Well, Damascus Gate is, for one thing, the most beautiful gate.

02:35.211 --> 02:37.114
It's really emblematic of the city.

02:37.134 --> 02:46.328
If you were going to have a city feel or something, if you didn't put the Dome of the Rock on it, you'd put Damascus Gate on it.

02:46.908 --> 02:49.392
It's also the gate leading east.

02:49.372 --> 02:52.632
It's a case that is associated with

02:52.713 --> 02:59.382
martyrdoms and conversions and sudden visitations.

02:59.502 --> 03:06.191
I mean, it's the gate that all went through on the road to Damascus.

03:06.211 --> 03:09.155
So it's got these associations with reversals and conversions.

03:09.175 --> 03:15.964
Do you think of it in terms of a metaphor as well, or is it just a perfectly appropriate title?

03:16.084 --> 03:17.666
Well, I think it's both.

03:17.687 --> 03:21.792
You know, I think it's a good title, and it's a metaphor.

03:21.772 --> 03:25.617
The metaphor is very clear for you.

03:26.298 --> 03:28.842
Well, the metaphor is not so clear.

03:28.902 --> 03:31.446
I mean, it's not closely bound.

03:32.427 --> 03:44.003
It's kind of a little bit like Out of Ridge Reach, which is also, I mean, I mean it to be associative rather than directly referential.

03:44.324 --> 03:49.551
I mean, there are associations in Out of Ridge Reach, just in the words.

03:49.750 --> 04:00.585
And similarly, in Damascus Gate, less so in the sound of the word than in the, you know, in the word.

04:00.605 --> 04:01.949
It's associations, I think.

04:01.969 --> 04:02.190
Absolutely.

04:02.525 --> 04:07.798
I think it's fair to say that these are quintessential stone characters.

04:09.281 --> 04:12.309
Is there such a thing as a stone character?

04:12.790 --> 04:20.027
Well, a stone character is often somewhere far away from where he belongs, he or she belongs.

04:20.007 --> 04:27.098
doing something unlikely, but the world these days is full of people like that.

04:27.779 --> 04:34.430
They're appropriate subjects because they represent the contemporary world in a lot of ways.

04:35.591 --> 04:47.550
People, freelance reporters living in remote cities outside their own lives, so to speak.

04:48.087 --> 04:53.113
people in search of something, people in search of a light, in search of a free.

04:53.173 --> 04:57.539
There's a lot of such people, and I write about them.

04:57.559 --> 05:09.994
So they're my quintessential characters, I guess, people who are slightly lost in search of something.

05:10.632 --> 05:15.138
and in search of each other whether they know it or not.

05:15.158 --> 05:18.702
Would you consider yourself a stone character?

05:19.303 --> 05:37.246
Um, well, my life has been more stable because I've been married for a long time, and, you know, to the same man, and I think in my life, in a way, I would be a stone character, but it wasn't for a little bit of good luck.

05:37.266 --> 05:38.327
How was looking?

05:38.678 --> 05:51.256
When I have to do these interviews, I always say, I have to leave with my lead, and I have to leave with my food and sex.

05:51.817 --> 06:05.277
I know sometimes you feel a little shy about asking a novelist to consider a work in the context of a corpus, but do you see an art in your career that

06:05.408 --> 06:08.332
that really does speak for each book along the way.

06:08.512 --> 06:14.821
I mean, books that speak for where you are in your... Well, yeah, I think so.

06:17.685 --> 06:33.087
I mean, I like to think that I'm, you know, that I'm learning, that I'm, you know, that I'm getting better, that I'm learning, but everybody, you know, I think wants to think that, and I want to think it too, you know, that I'm learning in my business, that I'll go on continuing

06:33.455 --> 06:34.136
to learn.

06:35.558 --> 06:44.490
I've got, you know, what is for me, I think, more, you know, a substantial amount of work.

06:44.950 --> 06:56.045
And I think there's a, you know, not an ongoing, not something like an ongoing story, but there is a kind of art.

06:56.185 --> 07:02.213
I mean, we all like to think that our most recent book is our best.

07:02.193 --> 07:16.970
You know, I'm no exception to that.

07:16.990 --> 07:21.215
I liked Outer Bridge Reach very much.

07:21.235 --> 07:22.377
It was very important to me.

07:22.397 --> 07:22.877
It was very close to me.

07:22.897 --> 07:23.858
And this, in a way, is true.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.642
I'm so close to it, it's hard for me to distance myself and look at it.

07:26.662 --> 07:27.002
It's just normal.

07:27.337 --> 07:35.011
I think I'm trying to work faster.

07:35.271 --> 07:39.018
I'm trying to make them be better.

07:39.278 --> 07:41.943
I'm still trying to learn.

07:42.123 --> 07:48.795
Ideally, each one should be better than the last, because I will have learned a few things between both of them.

07:48.815 --> 07:50.137
Yeah, and that occasioned this question.

07:50.157 --> 07:52.281
I was showing my daughter the other day.

07:52.261 --> 07:59.872
instead of the Henry James New York edition, you know, as his performance.

07:59.892 --> 08:04.158
And when he was doing this, he was writing these puppets, you know, as his famous.

08:04.178 --> 08:11.669
But it also prompted him to go in and tinker with some of the early adopters, which is, you know, would you ever be tempted to make it 70-something to the New York edition of Robert Stone?

08:11.689 --> 08:13.792
Life is too short, at least.

08:14.053 --> 08:18.679
I mean, I don't work hard enough to be able to do that.

08:18.820 --> 08:19.180
I...

08:19.430 --> 08:23.637
For me, it would be, you know, I would feel like a regression.

08:23.697 --> 08:26.402
I would feel like I ought to be doing something else.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.505
That's, you know, what's past is that.

08:28.645 --> 08:32.011
Completed work in your view is completed work.

08:32.672 --> 08:33.293
Yeah, yeah.

08:33.313 --> 08:40.645
You know, Tim O'Brien, who I have the greatest respect for, I've been with him a couple of years ago, he said that.

08:40.962 --> 08:56.850
Very quietly, he had gone in and fooled around with Paciano, you know, from paperback, and he got a letter from a teacher, and from the course, and the teacher was reading it from the type cover, and the students were, and all of a sudden they said, we're not reading the same book.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.411
I mean, what's going on?

08:57.431 --> 08:59.274
But this is not something that you'd be tempted to do.

08:59.334 --> 09:00.396
Well, that's Tim.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.662
I mean, he's, you know, a great perfectionist.

09:03.642 --> 09:07.087
and, oh, I don't know, I might do that.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.469
I might do something like that.

09:08.529 --> 09:20.126
I think if something was bothering me, you know, and there are some, there are misprints and things like that that bother me or things I would have said a little better.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.610
I mean, I can see doing that.

09:22.650 --> 09:24.533
I can see making a change like that.

09:24.893 --> 09:29.240
I wouldn't go through the whole thing looking for... I mean artistic changes.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.021
Yeah.

09:30.305 --> 09:36.226
I wouldn't do that simply because I don't feel like the time.

09:36.668 --> 09:38.354
Do you ever edit while you're reading, though?

09:38.374 --> 09:39.638
I mean, like you're reading?

09:39.659 --> 09:39.759
Yeah.

09:39.779 --> 09:40.080
Oh, yeah.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.766
And you see something that...

09:42.151 --> 09:47.017
and you feel you can express better until you do it right there?

09:47.037 --> 09:47.899
Yeah.

09:47.999 --> 09:49.280
Oh, I do that all the time.

09:49.361 --> 09:56.470
I mean, sometimes I'm thinking, hey, you know, how could I have let this get back at me?

09:56.590 --> 09:59.294
And other times I'm thinking, hey, this is even good.

09:59.814 --> 10:03.840
You know, it's different experiences.

10:03.860 --> 10:07.344
You say this stuff was particularly important to you.

10:07.725 --> 10:08.266
How is that?

10:08.286 --> 10:09.407
Why is that?

10:09.995 --> 10:15.494
Well, I mean, I think the character is really a lot like me in a lot of ways.

10:16.698 --> 10:22.738
I share a lot with his character, and I don't know, he's just somewhat less.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.044
Selfish.

10:25.046 --> 10:25.507
I like him.

10:25.968 --> 10:28.072
Maybe I like him better.

10:28.092 --> 10:28.352
I don't know.

10:28.372 --> 10:32.962
He's a nicer guy than some of the other characters.

10:33.182 --> 10:42.921
I know when he expresses his religion as once practicing, but now I've read interviews with you that this pretty much describes your own status.

10:43.289 --> 10:44.231
Yeah, that's true.

10:44.331 --> 10:55.311
I mean, I've always been writing, you know, around, under, around, and so forth, religion, and this time I took it on directly.

10:55.331 --> 10:58.998
I really find a lot of that Kabbalistic stuff, you know, sublime.

10:59.298 --> 11:01.382
I mean, really sublime.

11:01.666 --> 11:10.044
And I wanted to take it on, presumed to take it on directly.

11:10.104 --> 11:14.393
He has other reflections that are on the subject of religion

11:14.542 --> 11:20.869
you know, which are flat out, which are not indirect, but direct.

11:20.889 --> 11:28.518
And I always kind of wanted to allow myself to do that if I could get away with it.

11:28.538 --> 11:33.063
I thought I could get away with it, and I hope I got away with it.

11:33.083 --> 11:39.651
Is it particularly appropriate, do you think, at this point in your life, to take one of these various things, something?

11:39.671 --> 11:41.914
Well, it was one thing that I had to deal with.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.076
This seems like as good a time as any.

11:45.187 --> 12:10.660
I don't know where that's going to lead me.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.501
I'm still sort of lost in that dimension.

12:11.521 --> 12:12.423
So I don't know what the future holds for me.

12:12.443 --> 12:13.564
I was trying to find out, I guess, when I read the book.

12:13.584 --> 12:14.265
But I still feel sort of... I see.

12:14.498 --> 12:19.004
So writing the book is an exploration for you as well.

12:19.085 --> 12:22.510
I did an interview in London a couple of weeks with Penelope Fitzgerald.

12:22.610 --> 12:28.959
I spent all of a sudden having the only interview with her in the United States by an American Journal of Greenhand Photographs.

12:29.019 --> 12:31.883
I've been able to place it now in my 30th century.

12:32.318 --> 12:37.747
She says, she never even starts a book, and she says, I have to have my first paragraph and my last paragraph.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.490
It's very interesting.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.333
And the title, which they always change on her.

12:41.353 --> 12:44.699
But I said, well, that's very interesting.

12:45.260 --> 12:50.749
By knowing your final paragraph, then you clearly know where this thing is going.

12:50.769 --> 12:55.677
Well, she says, yeah, in her case, what I'm saying, I'm just using this as a way of asking you,

12:55.994 --> 13:08.112
I don't think that's the case with you, where you say it is an exploration, and you know where we're doing this, and I guess where the characters are, but it's a journey for you.

13:08.332 --> 13:14.902
That's just like a painter knowing something about the last element they're going to put in the painting.

13:14.922 --> 13:20.550
It doesn't really mean that they know what the whole thing is going to be like.

13:20.783 --> 13:31.601
Even if I know the ending or if I have a scene in mind near the ending, it doesn't mean I know Vanilla Holt Harriot.

13:32.643 --> 13:40.075
I think you always should have some kind of sense of what the ending is going to be like.

13:40.055 --> 13:41.199
of how it feels.

13:41.922 --> 13:51.415
Even if you don't know exactly what it is and what happens and how it turns out to everybody, you have a scene in mind that you're working through.

13:51.817 --> 13:55.143
It doesn't mean you know the narrative in advance.

13:56.346 --> 14:01.415
It's quite a rich cast of characters, I have to say, that you have here.

14:01.455 --> 14:03.920
Did you plan a really big book?

14:04.441 --> 14:13.538
Well, I didn't exactly plan it, but I knew that it was going to be a big book.

14:13.805 --> 14:18.701
Sometimes it was so big that I, you know, I was about to give up on it.

14:18.802 --> 14:21.992
I mean, I felt, you know, hopeful.

14:22.052 --> 14:22.915
Did you despair?

14:23.377 --> 14:26.447
Yeah, I did.

14:26.933 --> 14:41.748
And there were times when I said, if this isn't, you know, if I haven't got this together, and a sense of, you know, confidence by, you know, by summer or by Christmas or something, I'm going to put advantage of something else.

14:41.768 --> 14:43.250
But I kept being drawn on.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.852
I kept doing it.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.254
Kept your eye on the ball.

14:47.794 --> 14:48.275
Yeah.

14:49.196 --> 14:53.300
The importance of story is in your work.

14:53.420 --> 14:54.561
I mean, it's very...

14:54.541 --> 14:56.564
Well, story is important for me.

14:56.704 --> 15:18.017
I mean, I use plot, I use the old-fashioned realistic narrative, and if you're going to choose to do that, I mean, I don't think there's necessarily a better way of doing things than the non-realistic or post-realistic.

15:19.128 --> 15:25.499
But it is a way, and if you want to do it, you've got to follow through on it.

15:25.519 --> 15:28.123
You've got to follow through.

15:28.223 --> 15:30.768
And so that's the mode that I most commonly use.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.733
I depart from it sometimes.

15:33.853 --> 15:40.203
I mean, some of my scenes are pretty strange and not strictly realistic, and I may do more in that direction.

15:40.283 --> 15:45.372
In a way, some of my first novel is my least realistic, capital R.

15:45.723 --> 15:52.632
than with the others.

15:52.932 --> 15:54.935
The Jerusalem syndrome.

15:54.975 --> 15:58.479
Tell me a little bit about this is an actual... Oh, that's a real, sure.

15:58.519 --> 16:02.064
That's an actual... I agree with that.

16:02.104 --> 16:04.727
That would be a great story for a journalist to write about.

16:04.827 --> 16:06.289
I'd go after that with myself.

16:06.369 --> 16:08.873
Well, I think people are out there after it.

16:09.834 --> 16:10.415
Is that right?

16:10.435 --> 16:10.735
Yeah.

16:10.715 --> 16:14.903
And you became aware of it, first of all, having spent so much time there.

16:14.923 --> 16:20.274
It sounds to me like, you know, have you developed contacts, the way you develop contacts like this?

16:20.314 --> 16:21.056
Yeah.

16:21.156 --> 16:21.817
Sort of.

16:21.837 --> 16:26.066
Like six people killed a day, not five, not seven, not six a day.

16:26.366 --> 16:27.028
Yeah.

16:27.308 --> 16:30.715
And have you met sources like this who promise you, you know,

16:30.695 --> 16:36.706
The real thing on those files and... Yeah.

16:36.726 --> 16:37.968
Oh, yeah.

16:38.128 --> 16:49.829
And so you really have to have a... Well, it doesn't always matter what's bullshit and what's not.

16:49.950 --> 16:51.893
Sometimes, you know, sometimes it's...

16:52.075 --> 16:56.482
You know, bullshit is, you know, perfectly fine.

16:59.767 --> 17:00.789
It's funny.

17:02.011 --> 17:08.622
You mentioned in New York at that lunch, you know, how Jerusalem really impresses you.

17:08.642 --> 17:11.026
I mean, it's an ancient historical city.

17:11.046 --> 17:14.591
But on the other hand, there is not just a sense of the past.

17:15.513 --> 17:16.294
I wonder if you could...

17:16.477 --> 17:21.236
Well, I always felt there was no past, that everything was about now.

17:21.417 --> 17:24.951
Everything was about a kind of an ongoing now.

17:25.319 --> 17:47.817
a future which is you know kind of a transcendent future and a present which is dynamic and and up for grabs but no cast i mean every all those old stones aren't really about the past and the way that if you go to you know greece or rome in a way what you're seeing

17:48.421 --> 18:04.371
You can't say it's dead because it's still contributing to art, but it is of the past.

18:05.060 --> 18:14.171
The mosque and the Western Wall and so forth in Jerusalem, those things are about right now.

18:14.831 --> 18:16.213
They're going on right now.

18:16.954 --> 18:25.404
They're actively functioning, actively being fought over.

18:25.484 --> 18:29.008
If you dig a tunnel, you're likely to have a riot.

18:28.988 --> 18:32.472
I mean, there is no balance.

18:32.492 --> 18:35.335
It is amazing, isn't it?

18:35.375 --> 18:42.702
They have all these different religious groups, all attracted to this particular place.

18:42.722 --> 18:48.468
John Keegan has said, you know, he's traced the importance of place and the history of battles, you know.

18:48.528 --> 18:52.793
Why have there been so many battles that are often fought in the same place?

18:52.813 --> 18:54.034
You know, what is it about a place

18:54.014 --> 18:57.498
And you can always say the same thing here.

18:57.758 --> 19:09.612
I mean, originally, I mean, Jerusalem originally was important for just a reason like that.

19:09.632 --> 19:15.499
It controls the roots going north and south, and it also overlooks

19:16.137 --> 19:21.143
the plane towards the ocean, so it's strategically very important.

19:21.163 --> 19:26.870
But then it began to improve this supernatural dimension.

19:26.970 --> 19:33.978
As soon as David brought the art there, it became the home of the art.

19:34.438 --> 19:45.992
It became this kind of theater, almost, you know, kind of a cosmic theater where human destiny was packed out on a small

19:46.208 --> 19:53.044
scale, it became the place, you know, it became God's camp, it became God's own city.

19:53.144 --> 20:02.226
To the Crusaders, it was, I mean, you know, there they were sitting out in the middle of, you know,

20:02.678 --> 20:11.351
They had even the vaguest conception of where Jerusalem was or what it was like to live there.

20:11.451 --> 20:20.545
But they were prepared to put their armor on and go out and take it because it was holy to them as a notion, as an idea.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.872
So it's an extraordinary place and it goes on.

20:25.308 --> 20:49.256
It goes on driving people, driving people into allegiance and intensity of the idea of reviving.

20:49.276 --> 20:49.797
It just sort of repellents

20:50.924 --> 20:53.093
existence I'm making at a capital.

20:54.017 --> 20:56.507
The question of who's Jerusalem it is?

20:56.527 --> 21:00.563
Who really, who it really belongs to?

21:01.150 --> 21:03.193
It's an old, old bus.

21:03.213 --> 21:09.082
Did you go there with a sense of a notion that you were there for the first time, or did you go there?

21:09.242 --> 21:17.735
I went there kind of by accident as a tourist, because I've been doing a travel story in Egypt, and my wife and I had been, we'd been doing this trip in the desert.

21:17.755 --> 21:21.221
We ended up in the desert, in the Sinai Desert.

21:21.241 --> 21:30.094
We'd been out for weeks in the Land Rovers with a party of the German people.

21:30.530 --> 21:38.903
so that we'd been in these land rovers long enough that if Rommel came around the next sand dune, you know, it wouldn't have been defrauded for like a week in the Africa Corps.

21:39.344 --> 21:42.690
I mean, they were perfectly nuts.

21:42.850 --> 21:48.038
But anyway, we crossed the border.

21:48.178 --> 21:50.622
I mean, you know, we found ourselves in that corner.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.627
So we thought, well, you know, we can go back that way.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.250
We can work it out to go back that way.

21:55.310 --> 21:56.031
So we crossed.

21:56.365 --> 22:07.540
The Egyptian army lines, it wasn't just the border then, the army was sort of holding the line at the aftermath of the war.

22:08.212 --> 22:14.660
This is back in the 1980s, but they were returning Sinai.

22:14.680 --> 22:31.940
I guess this is the wake of the Yom Kippur War, and they're returning Sinai to Egypt in chunks, and they were just getting the last part of it back to the Egyptians.

22:31.960 --> 22:37.847
So we ended up in our lab across the border, and then we took a bus

22:37.827 --> 22:44.795
overnight through the Negev, which you didn't really see.

22:44.815 --> 22:50.723
And we arrived in Jerusalem in the early morning, just when the sun was coming up.

22:50.863 --> 22:57.090
All of the middle of Jerusalem is made with this pink stone.

22:57.110 --> 23:01.135
I mean, even the British Mandate made that a law.

23:01.672 --> 23:08.160
Everything built had to be built with that pink stone and master walls and so forth.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.122
It's really beautiful.

23:10.142 --> 23:17.031
It's a beautiful place to watch the sun come up because of the sun on the walls and the sun on the buildings.

23:17.291 --> 23:28.405
Then I got to know it a little better and I began to recognize how many people like my people that were around.

23:28.385 --> 23:36.684
This happens often to you.

23:36.704 --> 23:43.921
I mean, you mentioned last time we spoke, you were up on the last day, you saw these salmon going up the stream.

23:43.941 --> 23:47.389
That's going to figure in something and it became that wonderful.

23:47.740 --> 23:50.183
a wonderful story.

23:51.485 --> 23:53.467
I mean, this pretty much happens to you, doesn't it?

23:53.487 --> 23:57.733
I mean, you go places and you say, okay, you know, this is good.

23:57.873 --> 24:00.657
And it starts to happen.

24:00.677 --> 24:06.805
Whatever alchemic process takes place, it starts to kick in.

24:06.925 --> 24:13.513
And does the commitment to do a novel come first, or does the elements of a narrative?

24:13.533 --> 24:17.258
Well, more or less the thing, you know, the author

24:17.238 --> 24:20.461
You know, I mean, it kind of comes at once.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.343
They come together.

24:22.563 --> 24:30.570
I mean, the novel can exist abstractly from what makes it up, you know, what it's made of.

24:30.690 --> 24:35.475
So it's not so much that the idea of the novel is there.

24:35.495 --> 24:42.681
I mean, you've got to have the conception of the novel first before you can say, well, what I'll do now.

24:43.662 --> 24:46.705
I mean, the theory is when you come to the end of the book,

24:47.579 --> 24:49.381
You're going to start another novel.

24:49.401 --> 24:50.402
I mean, that's the assumption.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.804
That's my assumption.

24:51.964 --> 24:56.850
But I have to have, you know, I need more than that to go with.

24:57.111 --> 25:07.964
I have to, you know, I have to have something that's something that's moving, something that's important.

25:08.044 --> 25:13.430
Making Lucas a journalist, I think, is really a session for how this novel is.

25:13.450 --> 25:13.731
Oh, yeah.

25:13.751 --> 25:14.852
I don't know how you could have got it.

25:15.136 --> 25:16.559
with him being anything else.

25:17.039 --> 25:17.220
No.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.642
No, he has to be exposed.

25:18.662 --> 25:20.526
He has to be trafficking and information.

25:20.546 --> 25:22.149
He has to be dozy.

25:22.209 --> 25:29.142
He has to meet with these kinds of people and kind of get into this mix.

25:30.264 --> 25:34.451
I don't know what else you could have made him.

25:34.471 --> 25:38.038
The journalist is a pretty good parent, kind of a generic character.

25:38.373 --> 25:38.936
There's a lot.

25:38.956 --> 25:46.611
We've covered so much of this stuff, and I did tape everything that you did in New York, so that I had to feel free to use some comments there, so I'm headed into it.

25:46.895 --> 25:56.508
cover ground we've covered before.

25:56.528 --> 26:13.411
You know, I'll be able to let you go real quick if you can get rid of it.

26:13.431 --> 26:14.773
One thing I was really taken by is a quote.

26:14.793 --> 26:16.154
Do you consider writing as a form of religion for you?

26:16.174 --> 26:16.255
Yes.

26:16.275 --> 26:16.615
It is

26:16.763 --> 26:23.292
You know, it's sort of going up against, you know, the fundamental nature of things.

26:23.312 --> 26:30.462
And it's, you know, there is in aesthetics a certain transcendent element.

26:30.482 --> 26:34.167
You know, art is religion in a way.

26:34.187 --> 26:37.692
At least it's as close as I can comment and organize it.

26:37.712 --> 26:44.041
Is there any sense of explanation for you from practice or whatever where you're writing?

26:44.061 --> 26:45.403
Well, in a traditional sense,

26:45.670 --> 26:51.976
Yeah, that's what I mean, and that's what I want to adopt in the reader.

26:53.178 --> 27:03.428
I mean, because whether it's a religious one or, you know, whether it's a kind of a moral one, I don't know.

27:03.568 --> 27:07.112
The aesthetic one is just buzzed up for the moment.

27:07.132 --> 27:13.979
What you do as an individual, you have these epiphanous moments when you're out there, and they do almost explode into being, they give you the stuff for work.

27:13.999 --> 27:14.359
Yeah, it works.

27:14.379 --> 27:14.479
Yeah.

27:14.864 --> 27:18.773
What would be next on your horizon as a writer?

27:19.073 --> 27:20.997
What areas would you like to explore?

27:21.098 --> 27:28.053
I think, actually, I was going to do something about a missionary in Alaska in the 30s.

27:31.942 --> 27:32.603
A novel?

27:33.578 --> 27:34.559
I think they're funny.

27:34.579 --> 27:34.900
Would you?

27:35.440 --> 27:37.864
I'm sure you've got to inscribe one of these for me.

27:37.964 --> 27:39.926
I've looked at my editor.

27:39.946 --> 27:43.271
This is for Allen, J-L-L-E-N, peacock.

27:43.371 --> 27:47.296
Let me give you a good tip.

27:48.317 --> 27:50.260
I'll give you something nice about this.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.102
He was jumping home, right?

27:52.122 --> 27:54.485
Yeah, you heard that, yeah.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.548
Needless to say, he's cutting me a bit of paint.
