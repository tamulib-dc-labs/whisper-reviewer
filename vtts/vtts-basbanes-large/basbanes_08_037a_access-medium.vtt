00:03.473 --> 00:04.594
I'm talking to Bruce Olds.

00:06.756 --> 00:07.817
Don't mind me.

00:07.837 --> 00:08.058
All right.

00:09.179 --> 00:11.581
Oh, this means I can't get up and perambulate.

00:11.601 --> 00:13.403
You can go anywhere you want.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.285
I'll just follow you with me.

00:17.207 --> 00:24.154
Congratulations, Bruce, on your book, which, as you can see, I had a dog ear in my newest copy of it.

00:24.794 --> 00:25.155
Thank you.

00:25.295 --> 00:27.077
And we're going to talk.

00:27.217 --> 00:28.418
I've read the book, so...

00:28.769 --> 00:37.219
If it seems a time that I'm not questioning you about it, my job is to read it, and so that's, you know, I'll do that.

00:37.239 --> 00:41.143
But inevitably we will talk about it.

00:41.163 --> 00:44.867
I guess I'm fascinated by John Brown, of what form to do.

00:44.968 --> 00:46.289
And it's a first start.

00:46.309 --> 00:48.552
This is the first book for you.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.595
First work of fiction, I guess, is that right?

00:52.716 --> 00:55.840
So tell me how, why John Brown would come?

00:56.883 --> 01:04.513
Is that very, very... Let's just enter the conversation.

01:04.714 --> 01:04.834
No.

01:05.395 --> 01:14.387
There's no sexy stories about how I saw a photograph and was struck.

01:14.828 --> 01:15.589
Histographic?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.991
Yeah.

01:17.011 --> 01:21.837
Or how I heard childhood stories and they fascinated me.

01:21.857 --> 01:26.063
It's really... I came to it...

01:27.005 --> 01:29.247
in a more intellectual fashion than that.

01:29.707 --> 01:30.868
It's a bit more calculated.

01:30.909 --> 01:57.012
I just, for whatever reason, I've always been attracted to or fascinated by what I call pathologies of American culture and specifically how those pathologies manifest themselves in our collective past

01:57.312 --> 01:59.375
in American history.

02:02.800 --> 02:08.367
When I talk about pathologies, I suspect there's an infinite number of them.

02:10.651 --> 02:21.025
I mean, as Americans, our proclivity to violence, gunplay, or schizophrenia about sex,

02:21.764 --> 02:36.463
what I call the mammon factor, our tendency to supermaterialism, the various perverse ways that we express our religiosity.

02:37.544 --> 02:39.447
Religiosity.

02:39.687 --> 02:40.909
Yeah, religiosity.

02:41.409 --> 02:43.993
Just for my own sake of transcribing.

02:44.013 --> 02:44.714
Yeah, that's right.

02:44.854 --> 02:45.315
That's all right.

02:47.157 --> 02:49.560
I mean, as well as other stormtroopy

02:50.367 --> 03:17.090
little impulses that vent themselves from time to time in the culture that used to go by the kind of catch-all term of nativism, xenophobia, and that somehow the culture is spongy enough to keep from kind of bursting into some full-blown shitstorm.

03:17.391 --> 03:19.092
So it's these kind of carcinomas

03:19.730 --> 03:23.193
on the culture that have always attracted me.

03:23.954 --> 03:28.378
And certainly the granddaddy of them all is racism.

03:29.079 --> 03:49.078
And so when I was kind of casting about for either a personality or an event that I thought would trigger my imagination or that I would match up with on some level

03:49.413 --> 03:55.222
in terms of my own sensibility, John Brown just seemed to fit like a glove.

03:55.462 --> 04:04.336
I mean, that's a very long... Well, when you were casting a book, can you tell me what you... Let's fit in a little bit of biographical stuff.

04:05.257 --> 04:08.402
I gather that you worked as a journalist.

04:08.502 --> 04:08.783
Right.

04:09.924 --> 04:13.129
Could you just give me a little bit... Hi.

04:13.149 --> 04:13.209
Hi.

04:13.229 --> 04:17.496
Could you give me a little bit of background about your...

04:18.320 --> 04:24.849
what you've done in terms of journalism?

04:24.869 --> 04:25.469
What kinds of jobs did you do?

04:25.489 --> 04:26.371
Just doing basic things.

04:26.431 --> 04:27.372
Occupational stuff.

04:30.516 --> 04:37.505
Well, I came out of graduate school at the University of Wisconsin and took a job.

04:38.106 --> 04:39.848
What did you study?

04:40.029 --> 04:41.811
Well, I had my master's in journalism.

04:42.632 --> 04:44.755
My undergraduate degrees were in English and history.

04:46.637 --> 04:47.078
Both were Wisconsin?

04:48.239 --> 04:53.425
and took a job fairly quickly.

04:53.465 --> 05:02.456
I was offered a job out of graduate school working for a $70,000 circulation daily outside of Philadelphia in Bucks County.

05:04.078 --> 05:08.122
The first day on the job was handed my own personal signed column.

05:10.685 --> 05:15.010
That's pretty good.

05:16.632 --> 05:16.953
Yes.

05:17.113 --> 05:18.094
I never...

05:18.901 --> 05:22.365
served that kind of apprenticeship.

05:22.385 --> 05:26.891
I mean, I did those stories later on, but I didn't serve the apprenticeship.

05:27.312 --> 05:31.637
I was handed this really kind of privilege.

05:32.859 --> 05:35.722
That would have been 77.

05:35.742 --> 05:37.464
And you're how old?

05:37.484 --> 05:37.885
43.

05:40.228 --> 05:47.457
And I was there for about three years, much decorated in terms of winning

05:47.605 --> 06:09.580
awards, national and otherwise, and was offered a job in Baltimore at the now defunct News American, where I also had my own column.

06:10.049 --> 06:21.164
Yeah, the columns tended to run on the soft side, the feature side of paper, rather than on the hard side.

06:21.784 --> 06:33.660
And I did feature stories, and I did Sunday magazine pieces, and near the end did rewrite, when they used to have a rewrite man, and editing.

06:35.643 --> 06:37.525
And I spent...

06:38.585 --> 06:39.526
How many years there?

06:39.766 --> 06:40.047
Four.

06:40.868 --> 06:41.769
Four years there.

06:41.789 --> 06:43.471
So you're a native of Wisconsin.

06:43.491 --> 06:44.091
Yeah.

06:44.352 --> 06:50.118
And you're living now in Florida, is that right?

06:50.138 --> 06:52.441
For the next couple of weeks in Miami, yeah.

06:52.461 --> 06:55.184
So you've been down there how long?

06:55.724 --> 06:57.506
Approximately six years there.

06:57.526 --> 06:59.469
Is that another newspaper?

06:59.489 --> 07:01.331
My wife is in newspapers.

07:02.532 --> 07:05.976
She was an assistant managing editor at the Herald.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.963
And that's why we were there.

07:10.325 --> 07:14.131
I mean, she has worked for Newsday and the New York Post.

07:16.996 --> 07:20.661
She has also worked at the same paper in Baltimore.

07:20.681 --> 07:21.282
That's probably where you met.

07:21.302 --> 07:22.945
Well, no, we met in Bucks County.

07:22.965 --> 07:25.909
She was my boss and remains that.

07:28.734 --> 07:29.495
Yeah.

07:29.515 --> 07:29.635
Oh.

07:29.902 --> 07:37.852
So we were six years in Miami, and then she just recently left to come up here in the spring to work at the Star Ledger.

07:37.872 --> 07:40.936
Oh, that's great.

07:41.697 --> 07:46.503
So you said you were cast, to go back to a phrase, that we used casting above.

07:47.003 --> 07:54.913
So clearly the venture into writing fiction was not something that just came

07:56.210 --> 08:04.340
Right, right.

08:04.980 --> 08:22.521
It had to be what I call fiction that is written out of history.

08:22.838 --> 08:25.081
Can you put that phrase in quotes?

08:25.121 --> 08:26.503
I knew I wanted to do that.

08:28.845 --> 08:36.735
I'm fascinated by our collective past, American history.

08:36.996 --> 08:41.541
And so I knew going in that I wanted to do something.

08:41.561 --> 08:43.464
Now, that's a vast, vast period.

08:43.604 --> 08:51.333
Well, when you say out of history, does that mean that you reserve for yourself a prerogative to invent?

08:51.914 --> 08:52.575
Absolutely.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.582
Yeah, absolutely.

08:53.842 --> 08:57.286
I'm sure that you've done that with this flow.

08:57.306 --> 08:57.907
Absolutely.

08:58.588 --> 08:59.188
Absolutely.

08:59.609 --> 09:02.832
The whole question of, I don't know, we're probably going to come to this.

09:03.593 --> 09:09.159
Of how much is fact and how much is fiction and the whole thing.

09:09.240 --> 09:15.186
Do you feel an obligation to be accurate factually?

09:15.206 --> 09:15.386
No.

09:16.388 --> 09:16.588
You don't?

09:16.748 --> 09:16.808
No.

09:18.323 --> 09:21.869
I don't mind talking around if you're talking about it.

09:22.189 --> 09:23.471
No, I don't mind.

09:23.491 --> 09:26.757
That's the way the book was written, which we can talk about as well.

09:28.539 --> 09:44.365
No, I feel no... And I don't understand, quite frankly, don't understand why I ought to, I mean, if implicit in the question,

09:45.087 --> 09:56.783
For you, is John Brown a fictional character or a historical figure?

09:56.803 --> 09:57.724
What is he to you?

09:59.166 --> 10:06.256
Is he somebody that you feel a responsibility to profile?

10:06.276 --> 10:08.179
No, not at all.

10:08.479 --> 10:10.602
If I was going to do that, I'd write biography, wouldn't I?

10:10.722 --> 10:12.184
I mean, why wouldn't I?

10:12.244 --> 10:14.908
No, no, no.

10:16.222 --> 10:18.345
I'm not being judgmental at all.

10:18.365 --> 10:19.507
No, no, I understand.

10:19.848 --> 10:26.297
The historical John Brown, in the final analysis, is really someone who doesn't interest me that much.

10:29.102 --> 10:30.464
Why not write a biography?

10:30.504 --> 10:31.445
Why write a novel?

10:31.485 --> 10:41.200
Well, the reason one writes the novel is because it allows for, even demands, the introduction of the I...

10:42.277 --> 10:43.598
into the material.

10:43.658 --> 10:48.002
It allows the linkage of self into the material.

10:48.423 --> 10:53.207
John Brown, for me, the John Brown of Raising Holy Hell is a very personal John Brown.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.129
It's intended to be that way.

10:55.149 --> 11:00.074
When one writes a biography or journalism or history, just the opposite is true.

11:01.275 --> 11:10.083
One has to remain detached, distanced, objective, whatever words you want to use.

11:10.884 --> 11:12.165
This is a very subjective

11:12.736 --> 11:20.144
Now, the question is how much of it is true and how much of it isn't.

11:21.266 --> 11:28.053
It's a question that I think is not a good question, but I understand people's curiosity.

11:28.173 --> 11:29.835
And in fact, I didn't ask it.

11:29.855 --> 11:34.300
No, no, I asked it.

11:34.501 --> 11:34.981
I'll say this.

11:35.101 --> 11:40.988
There are three threads that run through the novel.

11:41.980 --> 11:55.420
And one thread is the material that is in there that is verifiable fact that comes straight from the historical record with corroboration.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.602
And I think that we can recognize it.

11:56.622 --> 12:05.355
And I think, I mean, and the other thread is all the stuff that I made up Hope Hoth.

12:06.348 --> 12:12.876
According to the voices of the various characters, which nobody could possibly have any idea what the voices were like.

12:13.957 --> 12:16.740
Particularly John Brown speaking from Beyond the Grey.

12:17.301 --> 12:29.335
Beyond the Grey, because you had a sense of what his voice was like while he was alive, you could imagine what he liked Beyond the Grey, but I think that a great deal of invention was involved here.

12:29.551 --> 12:37.744
But I think neither of these two threads are really... I mean, the wives and the siblings and the kids and all these various voices.

12:40.969 --> 12:41.950
Right, absolutely.

12:44.614 --> 12:47.699
Reading letters helps to an extent when you're picking up on voices.

12:47.719 --> 12:58.275
But I wanted to get back to the third thread, because the first two, the straight history and the straight invention, as it were,

12:58.610 --> 13:01.674
are not really, perhaps not that controversial or provocative.

13:02.114 --> 13:16.473
But there's a third thread, and the third thread is, at times, throughout the book, deliberate violation of, distortion of, and contradiction of what we know to be true.

13:17.354 --> 13:28.228
So that you have these three threads, and they're braided together on virtually every page, sometimes in the same paragraph, often in the same sentence.

13:28.732 --> 13:54.975
so that I can dip into that book and find a sentence and say, this part of the sentence is historically accurate, this part of the sentence I made up whole cloth out of my head, and this part of the sentence I know to be false, but I violated the historical fact of the matter to suit my own fictional purposes.

13:55.360 --> 14:04.849
for my own fictional reality, to create my own fictional reality, or for the sake of dramatic tension, or whatever reason suited my purpose.

14:05.229 --> 14:06.551
So do you have a name for what you did?

14:07.351 --> 14:07.872
Can you describe it?

14:07.892 --> 14:08.793
I have a name for what I did.

14:08.813 --> 14:14.458
Well, I don't think it's accurate to call it historical fiction, because it's certainly not conventional historical fiction.

14:15.039 --> 14:23.967
And, I mean, it's not the sort of fiction... You really wouldn't encourage anybody to go to this book, anybody who wanted some kind of an accurate...

14:24.757 --> 14:26.900
record of what happened.

14:27.942 --> 14:30.706
I mean, maybe they've probably been a struggle.

14:30.806 --> 14:37.696
Well, when you say accurate, I'll pluck a marquee name out of the ether and quote him.

14:37.856 --> 14:54.561
Il Doctorow, who said, respecting Reiton, when asked a similar question, said, I am satisfied that everything I made up is true, and probably all the truer for my having made it up

14:55.503 --> 14:57.466
And to that I say, bravo.

14:58.108 --> 15:02.856
I mean, that is my impulse as a novelist, precisely.

15:03.938 --> 15:12.152
When you say accurate, do you mean accurate historically or accurate journalistically?

15:13.374 --> 15:14.496
You brought up Ragtag.

15:14.556 --> 15:18.523
Ragtag certainly uses historical characters, but I think

15:19.162 --> 15:28.676
the events that he... Oh, well, I'm not comparing Rave Time to Raging Holy Hell, but the impulse... Well, we are writing about a very, very well-known historical event.

15:29.057 --> 15:29.698
Right.

15:29.718 --> 15:32.842
You know, led up to his execution.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.144
So that's on the record.

15:34.545 --> 15:39.212
And you are dealing with this... Obviously, this is what you do to have.

15:40.534 --> 15:42.377
There is an historical event.

15:43.078 --> 15:43.679
Another quote.

15:44.820 --> 15:45.041
Okay.

15:45.061 --> 15:45.321
Just...

15:45.824 --> 15:49.449
I'm not really one to drop names.

15:49.950 --> 15:53.635
I'm not one to drop names.

15:53.755 --> 15:55.738
Russell Banks made this statement.

15:56.178 --> 15:57.721
I might as well give credit where credit is due here.

15:57.741 --> 15:59.042
I don't pass these off as my own.

15:59.683 --> 16:03.689
He said that novels are not intended to be versions of history.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.112
Intended to be visions of life.

16:06.933 --> 16:13.823
And so I think you have to take the work on its own merit and say, does this work

16:14.545 --> 16:35.592
as a piece of fiction, or doesn't it, and not worry too much about what's true and what's made up, how much of it is true and how much of it's made up, and if you really, really are concerned about those issues, then my suggestion to you in all sincerity is to find a good biography.

16:35.943 --> 16:39.548
You'll have... That might not be doing as entertaining.

16:39.769 --> 16:40.670
Well, entertaining.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.892
Well, perhaps.

16:41.932 --> 16:46.199
I use the word entertaining in a very broad sense.

16:46.219 --> 16:49.524
We know it's a story to be entertaining.

16:49.684 --> 16:51.006
Well, among many things.

16:51.727 --> 16:52.608
To be touched on.

16:52.668 --> 16:56.274
I certainly think that storytelling is part of what you try to do.

16:56.294 --> 16:56.655
Absolutely.

16:57.516 --> 17:02.223
Someone else had asked me, do you consider yourself a storyteller?

17:02.263 --> 17:04.887
This is another interviewer.

17:05.677 --> 17:11.005
And I thought for a moment and finally said, well, of course I do.

17:11.245 --> 17:12.146
Of course I do.

17:14.730 --> 17:23.322
And my hesitation merely sprung from the fact that I consider myself to be so many other things first.

17:24.584 --> 17:31.954
I must say my own prejudices, and you can stick this in anywhere in the interview you want because this is kind of out of

17:32.457 --> 17:35.179
out of sequence here relative to what we're talking about.

17:35.199 --> 17:37.822
Okay.

17:37.842 --> 17:47.950
My own predilections are not to be attracted to heavily plotted or even cleverly plotted novels.

17:48.831 --> 17:54.336
What attracts me and what I'm concerned about is a lot of language.

17:58.299 --> 18:01.722
The rigging or scaffolding or structure

18:03.237 --> 18:13.527
of the story, and of course character, and the nuances of character.

18:17.451 --> 18:19.974
So that, am I a storyteller?

18:21.075 --> 18:22.417
Yes, of course I am.

18:22.877 --> 18:28.503
But, I mean, I'd be more comfortable just being called a writer of fiction.

18:28.523 --> 18:32.687
I mean, certainly this is a novel.

18:33.697 --> 18:37.000
I don't know if it's more accurate, perhaps, to call it a fiction.

18:37.701 --> 18:41.444
I mean, I don't know what the formal definition of a novel is.

18:44.527 --> 18:47.129
But is this fiction a novel?

18:49.331 --> 18:59.560
I'm not concerned with those kinds of formal definitions myself, and I'm very comfortable with calling this a novel, but if it is, and I believe it is, it's a novel that's somewhat unconventional.

19:00.061 --> 19:02.623
Well, and let's talk a little bit about destruction.

19:03.852 --> 19:17.712
After you had cast a vote and decided that there was something haunting, I guess, about John Brown, you mentioned the photograph again, which had fairly... Well, no, what I said, I think you'll hear it on here.

19:17.732 --> 19:18.233
I said...

19:18.584 --> 19:21.927
I have no story to tell you where I saw a photograph.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.169
No, it's just the opposite.

19:24.450 --> 19:31.616
Yeah, but I came to it in a much more cerebral way.

19:31.757 --> 19:46.971
My point is, having decided that John Brown would be your subject, taking it from there, instead of writing a conventional novel, you really came up with a fairly

19:47.677 --> 19:59.431
I'm happy to talk about the structure.

19:59.851 --> 20:04.156
It's one of the aspects of the book which I don't mind confessing a deep personal affection.

20:04.857 --> 20:17.211
All I knew, you say it was a premeditated, all I knew when I started out was that I wanted to write something compelling.

20:18.524 --> 20:42.633
by which I suppose I meant something different, by which I suppose I meant something idiosyncratic and personal, and perhaps, if I got very lucky, even unique, but without being merely novel, gimmicky, or avant-garde.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.978
And so one of the ways

20:49.186 --> 20:59.378
that I knew I wanted to do that is that I wanted to fiddle or toy around with or monkey around with notions of structure.

21:00.179 --> 21:02.542
I call it the ossature of the book.

21:04.224 --> 21:08.428
O-S-S-A-T-U-R-E.

21:09.770 --> 21:16.678
You seem to try to get that word but I'll try to describe it.

21:16.912 --> 21:22.801
You've been through this.

21:23.322 --> 21:24.183
No, I do, I do.

21:26.466 --> 21:34.038
So I knew I wanted to fiddle with structure a little bit, to do something different somehow.

21:35.420 --> 21:45.535
Now... Give me a sense, by the way, of the chronology, wouldn't it just get percolated as an idea and research it and tinkering?

21:46.088 --> 21:50.213
I guess there has to be a point where you say, hey, I'm on track here.

21:50.413 --> 21:58.343
You tinker and tinker, but all of a sudden it's working now, too, and you're excited about what you're doing.

21:58.363 --> 22:00.767
You're asking... I'm asking about 20 different questions.

22:00.947 --> 22:01.467
Right, that's right.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.529
Rephrase it again.

22:02.869 --> 22:10.579
I guess really give me an idea of a time, going from the idea that you wanted to do something like this to what you do.

22:10.599 --> 22:12.601
It must have been a lot of historical research.

22:12.621 --> 22:13.743
I did about a year's worth of homework.

22:14.123 --> 22:14.644
Yeah, you had to.

22:15.451 --> 22:35.232
I had to be well grounded enough in my subject, which is to say very well grounded, in order to be on sure enough footing to violate with some confidence and hopefully artfulness what was on the record.

22:37.515 --> 22:38.736
I did about a year's worth of homework.

22:38.756 --> 22:42.420
I took two or three trips to Harper's Ferry.

22:43.177 --> 22:44.639
What an extraordinary place.

22:44.879 --> 22:45.940
Which is a wonderful place.

22:46.681 --> 22:47.822
It's a great place.

22:49.404 --> 22:53.729
Which I haven't visited in about 25 years.

22:53.889 --> 22:54.870
It's a gorgeous spot.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.313
Tony Preserve.

22:57.393 --> 22:58.053
It's a time capsule.

22:58.133 --> 22:58.834
Yeah, it really is.

22:59.815 --> 23:00.396
It really is.

23:01.057 --> 23:05.622
The sense of history there really is overwhelming.

23:05.642 --> 23:07.163
I think it's unique.

23:07.904 --> 23:09.606
It's really a town.

23:10.480 --> 23:15.287
But it's just preserved exactly where it lasts, and you can walk through it.

23:15.307 --> 23:18.831
Except for the Harpers Ferry Armory itself, which is no longer there at all.

23:21.034 --> 23:23.037
But you were certainly able to visualize it.

23:23.057 --> 23:24.239
Oh, you can.

23:24.399 --> 23:25.240
You can visualize it.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.002
You can get a visual image of things.

23:27.023 --> 23:27.984
It must have helped you at all.

23:28.124 --> 23:28.444
Oh, it did.

23:28.585 --> 23:30.167
With the atmospherics, you know.

23:30.647 --> 23:36.936
The atmospherics, which is another... Well, technically, I'm just very attracted to what can be done with atmospherics.

23:36.956 --> 23:39.880
But it was about a year's...

23:40.197 --> 23:41.018
worth of homework.

23:41.118 --> 23:43.781
It took another nine months to a year to write it.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.426
And this was all on spec, right?

23:48.446 --> 23:48.686
No contract?

23:48.706 --> 23:51.930
Oh, it was in total isolation, in utter solitude.

23:51.950 --> 23:52.631
But I mean you had no agent?

23:52.991 --> 23:54.493
After years of—well, go ahead.

23:54.513 --> 23:56.435
You had no agent representing your interest?

23:56.615 --> 23:57.376
I had an agent.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.019
I had an agent.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.561
I always had an agent.

24:02.661 --> 24:08.668
I didn't experience too much trouble finding an agent, quite frankly.

24:10.066 --> 24:16.657
I don't know why, but, I mean, I've heard stories that agents are harder to come by than publishers.

24:17.458 --> 24:20.664
It's true, but I have to say I got mine first.

24:20.684 --> 24:21.926
Everybody's experience is different.

24:22.807 --> 24:23.869
I got mine fairly quickly.

24:27.455 --> 24:29.058
So, that's about two years.

24:29.118 --> 24:34.487
Now, how long was the idea germinating before I even started to research it?

24:34.788 --> 24:37.491
as I was casting about, the casting about process.

24:37.651 --> 24:38.492
How long did that take?

24:38.752 --> 24:40.894
This I have no clear memory of.

24:41.074 --> 24:44.617
What other pathological candidates did you have?

24:44.637 --> 24:46.079
Did you have a short list?

24:46.639 --> 24:55.187
Well, I actually started doing research about Benedict Arnold, but found... More passion here.

24:55.428 --> 24:55.508
Huh?

24:55.528 --> 25:04.356
Well, I mean, I just found Benedict Arnold being such an inhospitable character, so utterly without redemption that I just couldn't

25:04.775 --> 25:07.839
envision myself spending any length of time with the man.

25:09.261 --> 25:17.834
I mean, I did maybe a month or two with him and then just said, I can't do this.

25:17.854 --> 25:18.715
I know.

25:18.735 --> 25:19.636
I can't do this.

25:19.656 --> 25:30.471
I interviewed any number of biographers, major big-time biographers like David McCullough and Justin Kaplan, who will tell you, you've got a subject and you discover all this.

25:31.012 --> 25:33.716
I don't want to live with this son of a bitch for the rest of the year.

25:33.736 --> 25:34.377
You test him.

25:34.627 --> 25:38.693
Well, Cabal was doing Picasso before he went over to Truman.

25:38.713 --> 25:39.454
I hate this man.

25:39.474 --> 25:42.840
He said, the more I learn about it, the more I detest him.

25:42.860 --> 25:44.803
See you later, you know.

25:44.823 --> 25:55.900
You don't have to have, I don't think you have to have sympathy for your subject, but you have to have a very deep empathy.

25:57.302 --> 25:57.442
Yeah.

25:57.462 --> 26:00.907
He's quite a fascinating character.

26:00.927 --> 26:01.268
Oh, he is.

26:01.288 --> 26:02.710
Yeah, they're late.

26:02.993 --> 26:05.175
self-flagellation.

26:05.195 --> 26:07.157
Again, that's all factually.

26:07.177 --> 26:08.238
The self-flagellation?

26:08.378 --> 26:08.799
Yeah, all that stuff.

26:10.481 --> 26:14.144
Twenty children, that's... I mean, you can't... Well, you could.

26:14.224 --> 26:15.846
You see, I mean, I reserve the right.

26:15.886 --> 26:18.949
Twenty children isn't factual.

26:19.270 --> 26:31.482
But, I mean, I just want to make clear that I reserve the right as a novelist to... If John Brown had twenty children and I want to have him have thirty children or no children, I reserve...

26:32.035 --> 26:33.757
that right as a novelist to do that.

26:34.798 --> 26:40.645
But I reserve that right... Well, why call John Brown at that point?

26:40.665 --> 26:42.186
Well... Maybe I'm missing something.

26:42.647 --> 26:52.278
Well, look, I mean, if I want to write a book where houses sprout legs and run down the street, as a novelist, I reserve the right to do that.

26:53.219 --> 27:00.127
Now we're talking about a surrealistic or maybe a magical, realistic form of fiction, which this is not.

27:01.028 --> 27:01.468
But...

27:01.786 --> 27:07.736
You could write a magically realistic or surrealistic novel about John Brown.

27:08.237 --> 27:09.099
I mean, why not?

27:09.700 --> 27:16.632
And, you know, it depends upon the... Right, right.

27:16.672 --> 27:17.954
It's too technical.

27:17.974 --> 27:23.745
It's not something, frankly, that only... That people are going to care about.

27:23.765 --> 27:25.047
I accept your explanation.

27:25.067 --> 27:25.127
No.

27:26.238 --> 27:28.100
Where were we?

27:28.301 --> 27:29.602
Fascinating figure, absolutely.

27:29.662 --> 27:30.784
Haunting figure.

27:30.804 --> 27:37.913
When you mentioned Benedict Allen, was there anyone else on your short list?

27:37.933 --> 27:39.234
No, so it was Brown, obviously.

27:39.254 --> 27:47.545
So you're thinking, so you came to this guy, you researched him, he started to develop, and then this structure, did this structure come to you?

27:47.705 --> 27:49.267
You know, I'll tell you about this structure.

27:49.747 --> 27:50.689
It's a very odd thing.

27:50.769 --> 27:54.253
I mean, like I said, I knew I just wanted to do something different, but that doesn't tell you much.

27:54.622 --> 28:06.470
I knew I did not want to write a conventional linear point A to point B to point C to point D narrative.

28:07.051 --> 28:09.818
I wasn't interested in doing that.

28:09.838 --> 28:12.985
Why was I not interested in doing that?

28:13.117 --> 28:15.661
Why does one like the color blue instead of the color red?

28:15.921 --> 28:16.682
I mean, I don't know.

28:16.782 --> 28:21.729
Because I am attracted as a human being and as a reader and as a writer to work that doesn't do that.

28:23.892 --> 28:30.000
What kind of books do you read that put you on the spot?

28:32.824 --> 28:35.528
Are you bored by the conventional narrative forms there?

28:35.668 --> 28:41.436
Or do you feel that they have forms that have been fairly well developed and you wanted to try something that hadn't been?

28:42.715 --> 28:45.798
You might say that.

28:45.838 --> 28:49.742
I think it's a matter of temperament as much as anything else.

28:52.525 --> 28:58.210
I mean, I find this to be the case even in film.

28:58.470 --> 29:08.520
I'm attracted to film that is broken-backed and episodic and elliptical and ambiguous and

29:09.243 --> 29:16.091
and atmospheric and all of those things.

29:16.251 --> 29:27.084
And I just really believe that explicitness and literalness is the enemy of art.

29:28.105 --> 29:35.214
Is the John Brown of your imagination similar to whom you've ever developed in affection?

29:35.354 --> 29:36.195
Something you know?

29:36.530 --> 29:37.852
Who became real for you?

29:37.872 --> 29:38.693
Oh, absolutely.

29:38.773 --> 29:48.547
I mean, I feel I know him, and he did become real for me, and my feelings about him are mixed.

29:51.951 --> 29:53.554
Extremely mixed.

29:54.295 --> 29:57.579
And this, by the way, is the character you created.

29:58.580 --> 29:58.721
Mm-hmm.

29:58.741 --> 30:05.490
Because you've already acknowledged that you felt free to let him go, or to reabuse... I don't mind saying...

30:05.521 --> 30:17.593
I don't mind saying that Bruce Oles is there in every sentence, and that I have found in the aftermath of writing this book something that's fairly frightening to me.

30:19.054 --> 30:30.806
Which is that I am John Brown on many, many more levels than I might want to, temperamentally and psychically.

30:33.889 --> 30:35.410
To an extent, it's a marriage.

30:36.892 --> 30:38.454
To an extent, it's a marriage.

30:39.956 --> 30:41.138
I didn't realize it at the time.

30:41.178 --> 30:56.579
John Brown is an extremely angry, extremely profoundly alienated character, and if I'm to be honest with myself, I am too, for whatever reasons.

30:57.180 --> 31:04.890
Did you find, I mean, I certainly find that many descriptions of the institution of slavery and the development of that community, and

31:06.845 --> 31:11.250
the process by which they were brought here and how they lived here.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.652
I have a sense of outrage here in your part.

31:13.893 --> 31:17.417
I mean, you know, much have been written about slavery.

31:17.477 --> 31:24.124
You really are putting your own stamp on this, your own spin on it.

31:24.144 --> 31:34.836
And I'm wondering if there was a sense, a feeling that you had about this awful chapter of American history that you wanted to comment on in this novel.

31:34.856 --> 31:35.957
As I just throw it out,

31:36.494 --> 31:47.353
You certainly dug up a lot of stuff, honestly.

31:47.373 --> 32:00.156
I did a lot of research on the topic and brought together in a very sort of tunneled or... You certainly had to explain Brown's

32:00.828 --> 32:04.312
I felt I had to do more than just write a novel about John Brown.

32:04.332 --> 32:17.827
In order to make John Brown mean anything, I had to furnish some sort of context, and that's where the examination of slavery comes from, and that's where the Nat Turner stuff comes from.

32:17.867 --> 32:29.400
I felt that including that stuff was absolutely essential to having any sense of this character.

32:30.781 --> 32:49.224
Outraged by slavery, I mean, well... You were trying to get back to the structure and stuff like that.

32:50.565 --> 32:51.967
I'll tell you one thing about this book.

32:51.987 --> 32:56.653
This book was not... It is chronology.

32:58.068 --> 33:12.304
or the chronological ordering of the material that gives it more of a structure than perhaps I might have intended, even.

33:15.888 --> 33:17.890
The book was not written chronologically.

33:18.911 --> 33:20.253
We were talking about this at once.

33:21.454 --> 33:26.860
That book was written, I hopscotched all over the place.

33:27.616 --> 33:30.680
The stuff that comes at the very end was written first.

33:31.901 --> 33:34.604
The stuff that came at the very beginning was written second.

33:36.206 --> 33:41.272
Some of the stuff in the middle was written near the beginning and blah, blah, blah.

33:41.312 --> 33:44.056
I mean, I just, I hopscotch from one thing to another.

33:44.096 --> 33:47.500
The description of his execution, Richard, is almost very journalistic.

33:48.781 --> 33:48.982
Yeah.

33:49.983 --> 33:52.546
Is that really accurate, by the way, the comments that he made?

33:52.926 --> 33:53.387
Yeah.

33:53.553 --> 33:54.915
That is.

33:55.416 --> 33:58.662
Was he really impatient about getting off the disc at the goddamn thing?

33:58.682 --> 33:59.023
He was.

33:59.083 --> 34:02.368
Already, you know, you're keeping me waiting, let's do it.

34:02.388 --> 34:03.290
Yeah, I think, yeah.

34:03.310 --> 34:08.740
Yeah, I mean, that's certainly... It was such a character, in fact.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.583
I mean, it was wonderful.

34:10.623 --> 34:18.717
You know, this character, you're looking for that, what are you telling... Well, what you look for, yeah, when you're researching...

34:19.102 --> 34:31.742
You're looking for little telling things that you can take and run with, or you're looking for gaps that you can throw this wonderful stuff into the breach, as it were.

34:31.822 --> 34:32.703
So you are, yes.

34:32.743 --> 34:37.110
When you go out and you research as a novelist, you're using a novelist's eye,

34:37.681 --> 34:47.074
casting it on the research, and looking for those little tiny things that may spark something that you can take and run with, or you're looking for that stuff that's not there.

34:47.735 --> 34:58.550
I can't emphasize too much how important it is to find, to look for and find what is not there.

34:59.231 --> 35:05.680
I have to feel also that when you're writing a story that you just

35:06.402 --> 35:12.371
the bare bones of it involved a person who every school could knows about.

35:12.391 --> 35:13.753
John Brown's body.

35:13.773 --> 35:16.337
You know, you can sing a song about it.

35:16.357 --> 35:17.919
You know, basically what happened.

35:18.640 --> 35:29.977
So even while you reserve for yourself the prerogative of changing and inventing and elaborating and improvising, you still have to know how the story ends.

35:30.137 --> 35:32.500
He still has to hang for his crime.

35:34.163 --> 35:34.283
Right.

35:35.157 --> 35:39.263
So within that sense, you had to know where you were going.

35:39.283 --> 35:41.146
You had to end where it did.

35:43.530 --> 35:46.314
But while you were writing it then, what was the challenge to create?

35:46.394 --> 35:50.400
Did the character go in directions that he wanted to go?

35:53.505 --> 36:03.139
Keeping in mind the fact that even though it is a character-driven novel, you are pretty much confined by the way it has to end, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.

36:03.457 --> 36:06.340
pretty specific resolution that we all know about.

36:06.421 --> 36:09.104
You don't have to surprise anybody with the way it is.

36:09.725 --> 36:11.407
The surprise is going to be in how we get there.

36:11.427 --> 36:13.029
Well, in how you get there, of course.

36:13.169 --> 36:13.569
Of course.

36:14.490 --> 36:18.455
I guess that was a long time.

36:18.515 --> 36:19.436
That's okay.

36:19.617 --> 36:33.193
My only reaction to that is that this material yielded itself up to me in the way...

36:33.899 --> 36:37.423
that it determined it would yield itself up.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.605
I did a... Was it in control?

36:39.625 --> 36:39.885
Yes.

36:41.127 --> 36:41.347
No.

36:41.627 --> 36:49.436
I found that the more I tried to control the material, manipulate the material, and direct the material, and put my own... You got your hand slapped.

36:49.456 --> 36:51.618
...very conscious stamp on the material.

36:51.958 --> 36:54.701
You can say I got my hand slapped if you want.

36:54.841 --> 37:00.427
I blocked at one point because I tried to control the material too much.

37:00.467 --> 37:03.771
I blocked for two or three weeks.

37:04.561 --> 37:10.128
I found myself having to, when I did that, to go back and throw material away.

37:10.148 --> 37:20.220
I found myself, I mean, it was a feeling of kind of going, this book is what it wanted to be.

37:20.560 --> 37:27.829
I don't know if this will make any sense, but this book is what it wanted to be, precisely what it, well, it's precisely what it needed to be.

37:30.112 --> 37:33.876
What the material communicated to me, what it wanted to be.

37:34.261 --> 37:41.669
Had I written the book, I, Bruce Olds, wanted to write, it would be a different book.

37:42.249 --> 37:46.234
As I mentioned before, well, it wouldn't be chronological for one thing.

37:47.995 --> 37:49.837
It wouldn't be chronological for one thing.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.781
It would be more ambiguous for another thing.

37:54.522 --> 38:01.990
And it would have a less documentary quality to it.

38:02.527 --> 38:06.953
and perhaps a dreamier or more nightmarish quality to it.

38:07.553 --> 38:16.305
But, that said, I'm just, I'm tickled with the way it turned out.

38:16.705 --> 38:18.628
But it needed to be what it is.

38:18.668 --> 38:20.710
Is he a tragic character?

38:21.471 --> 38:23.554
And if so, what is his tragic character?

38:23.574 --> 38:24.996
Tragic character.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.540
Well, we have to empathize with the characters.

38:28.560 --> 38:32.145
We have to feel for him, even though he committed crimes, you know.

38:32.986 --> 38:34.147
for which he was punished.

38:35.469 --> 38:40.054
Nevertheless, we have to empathize with him if he's going to be at all sympathetic.

38:40.495 --> 38:44.179
Well, look, I'll tell you what I personally admire about John Brown.

38:44.239 --> 38:48.344
Did you intend him to be sympathetic?

38:48.404 --> 38:52.889
You can continue with your answer, but keep that in mind.

38:52.909 --> 38:55.372
Did I intend the character to be sympathetic?

38:56.072 --> 38:58.195
You said what I admire about John Brown.

38:58.215 --> 39:01.879
Well, what I admire about John Brown is his purity.

39:02.585 --> 39:09.656
his purity of motive, his moral purity, if you want to call it that.

39:10.738 --> 39:25.302
That's not to say, of course, that one approves of his going out and killing people, but one can empathize with his purity.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.384
At least I can.

39:26.404 --> 39:29.689
It is what made this character

39:29.973 --> 39:31.215
palatable for me.

39:31.255 --> 39:35.822
It's why I was able to live with this character as long as I did.

39:35.842 --> 39:40.770
Did he like him in real life?

39:41.331 --> 39:42.372
It's too simple a question.

39:42.432 --> 39:43.674
I can't give a simple answer.

39:43.734 --> 39:45.697
I think there are things about him that I would like.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.320
There are many other things that I would not like.

39:47.340 --> 39:48.662
The man had no sense of humor.

39:50.986 --> 39:58.377
What I value in people in general is passion, intelligence, and a sense of humor.

39:58.863 --> 40:03.709
I generally have no use for people who are lacking in one of those qualities.

40:03.769 --> 40:07.053
So, you know, I might have him over for dinner.

40:07.073 --> 40:10.157
I'm not sure I want to be his best friend or anything like that.

40:10.197 --> 40:12.420
I mean, it's a hard case.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.805
This is a very stiff-necked character.

40:15.885 --> 40:17.266
At what point did you know you had it?

40:18.188 --> 40:24.876
And I'm not talking about in terms of time, but in terms of where you were in writing this.

40:24.896 --> 40:28.701
When did I know that it was clicking or something like that?

40:29.812 --> 40:31.994
You started to get excited.

40:32.054 --> 40:35.717
That moment comes when you feel a sense of excitement.

40:36.178 --> 40:38.760
Right, right, right.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.321
Again, a roundabout answer.

40:40.341 --> 40:43.544
I don't mean to be elliptical in these answers.

40:45.006 --> 40:48.329
Ordinarily, I am an agonizingly slow writer.

40:48.889 --> 40:54.194
I mean, you talked before about how you were moving out a clip of about a thousand words a day.

40:54.474 --> 40:56.216
Quiet.

40:56.656 --> 40:57.557
I have...

40:57.925 --> 41:02.249
heard of others who write, you know, twice that, three times that, whatever.

41:03.450 --> 41:04.491
I, oh, good for them, right.

41:04.531 --> 41:12.237
I mean, I probably had an output on a good day that was half of what your output was, ordinarily.

41:14.119 --> 41:15.200
This book was different.

41:16.821 --> 41:26.650
This book, from the beginning, I mean, once the research was done, once I had written the very end and the very beginning,

41:27.085 --> 41:29.769
which came to me like that.

41:31.791 --> 41:33.354
And you wrote those two parts first?

41:33.574 --> 41:43.928
Well, I wrote the funeral procession segment, which comes virtually at the end of the book, first.

41:44.048 --> 41:47.112
And you knew that was basically the end of the book when you wrote it?

41:47.553 --> 41:48.374
No, I didn't know that.

41:48.755 --> 41:50.497
Because you could almost have started the book.

41:50.697 --> 41:52.039
In fact, it wasn't the end of the book.

41:52.059 --> 41:53.802
Because you could have started the book with that.

41:53.822 --> 41:54.162
Could have.

41:54.903 --> 41:56.265
Could have.

41:57.224 --> 41:59.169
I never considered that, but there was a lot more.

41:59.189 --> 42:01.255
You could have.

42:01.275 --> 42:01.375
Yeah.

42:01.395 --> 42:03.541
You could have done that as kind of a flash forward.

42:05.105 --> 42:08.794
The self-flagellation scene, I think, is what I wrote.

42:09.035 --> 42:10.719
Yeah, I like that, actually.

42:10.739 --> 42:10.980
I like that.

42:11.669 --> 42:15.252
I mean, we know where we are.

42:15.292 --> 42:16.613
We have a sense of the character.

42:16.834 --> 42:17.354
Well, exactly.

42:17.394 --> 42:24.500
I mean, the whole point of that beginning scene was to touch on a number of, I don't know, what you want to do, you want to call them themes, you can.

42:24.581 --> 42:30.045
Touch a bunch of nerves that were going to be expanded upon in the rest of the book.

42:30.065 --> 42:34.069
It's a character-driven novel, so we might as well get a sense of the character straight away.

42:35.250 --> 42:35.370
Right.

42:35.390 --> 42:36.791
And very effectively.

42:36.811 --> 42:37.192
Well, thanks.

42:37.552 --> 42:38.053
Thanks.

42:38.073 --> 42:40.815
You said during lunch that there were things that

42:41.183 --> 42:50.276
had been taken out and which Alan had asked you to show him and which together you agreed should be received.

42:50.296 --> 42:53.240
Can you give you an idea of what some of these things were?

42:54.522 --> 42:55.504
You'd like to be specific.

42:55.524 --> 42:56.425
Well, I can be specific.

42:56.705 --> 43:08.963
All of the faith of our fathers, things which were almost verbatim

43:09.820 --> 43:14.567
quotations from the Founding Fathers, as well as Abraham Lincoln.

43:16.670 --> 43:39.304
That was all material that was there in the original manuscript, but... All of that stuff was there in the original manuscript in a different form, and Alan

43:40.364 --> 44:08.835
liked that stuff so much and thought it would be so effective and would add so much that we went back and forth because it could be perceived the wrong ways if I'm trying to gratuitously skewer these men and of course it's not

44:09.457 --> 44:11.559
there for that reason at all.

44:12.280 --> 44:24.074
It's there to lend context and also, particularly in the case of the Lincoln stuff, it's there to place into heightened relief John Brown.

44:26.717 --> 44:39.092
I mean, I think that we have an image, it's public property, of Abraham Lincoln as one thing when he was, is often the case,

44:39.545 --> 44:41.087
with our myths and legends.

44:41.147 --> 44:43.371
He was quite another.

44:44.032 --> 44:53.545
And so we placed Lincoln, or we placed John Brown alongside Lincoln, and we see the contrast.

44:55.789 --> 45:09.028
In my research, this is going to sound like a bold and provocative statement, there was no American historical figure

45:09.818 --> 45:17.546
white, up to John Brown, who was not a racist.

45:17.566 --> 45:19.588
They were all racists.

45:19.608 --> 45:22.450
I did not run across— By contemporary standards.

45:24.112 --> 45:25.193
Well, by contemporary standards.

45:26.494 --> 45:33.501
I mean— I hate to think that Tubbs-Jefferson was this racist, but— Of course he was a racist.

45:34.582 --> 45:35.363
Of course he was a racist.

45:35.383 --> 45:37.745
He has many other things, but he was a racist.

45:37.866 --> 45:39.387
Everyone was a racist.

45:39.822 --> 45:42.966
John Brown was the only one who wasn't.

45:45.008 --> 45:48.032
The only one I could come up with who wasn't.

45:48.752 --> 45:50.154
The only white person.

45:50.234 --> 45:54.639
White person, yeah, I qualified as a white person.

45:54.659 --> 46:03.990
So that material, I mean, especially the Lincoln material, is there to show really how radical

46:04.983 --> 46:07.266
and how unique John Brown was.

46:07.787 --> 46:24.549
Because I think we have an idea of Lincoln as being... So, you've had wonderful success with, certainly, all the signs there that you've got is a really wonderful book here.

46:25.070 --> 46:28.675
And I know it's premature, and everybody wants to write it.

46:28.775 --> 46:32.340
But, you know, it looks like it's certainly going in the right direction.

46:33.535 --> 46:35.278
You've got a wonderful letter there with Alan Peacock.

46:35.298 --> 46:35.959
Oh, absolutely.

46:35.979 --> 46:42.368
I mean, if you want to talk to me about, if you want me to talk about Alan and Holt, I can do that.

46:42.689 --> 46:54.287
I have so many friends who have had absolutely nightmarish, including yourself, including yourself, nightmarish experiences with having books published.

46:54.707 --> 47:00.816
I mean, I really think that God took care of me, but fear after what I went through.

47:00.977 --> 47:01.197
Yeah, yeah.

47:02.172 --> 47:06.479
It's so nice, so nice, so good, so caring.

47:06.499 --> 47:09.244
Right, it's almost like a family thing, isn't it?

47:09.785 --> 47:13.010
It sounds so corny and saccharine, but it's true all the same.

47:13.030 --> 47:17.077
I just don't care that it becomes true.

47:17.638 --> 47:24.990
But he, as an editor, I have to say, he just has this sensitivity, and he's so loyal to his audience.

47:25.747 --> 47:26.588
Well, to a fault.

47:26.888 --> 47:32.814
I mean, he was more upset about it than I was.

47:33.054 --> 47:35.917
You know, relax.

47:35.937 --> 47:38.860
Like, that was no big deal.

47:38.880 --> 47:44.326
But he really was very, very protective of his office.

47:44.346 --> 47:51.874
Well, and you and I, I think... Well, I won't strike that.

47:51.894 --> 47:54.336
I won't say anything, because it's private information.

47:54.738 --> 47:59.102
But no, he's just been the world's greatest editor, as far as I'm concerned.

47:59.122 --> 48:02.085
Now, tell me, you mentioned also at once that you're working on something else.

48:02.105 --> 48:02.746
Yeah.

48:02.766 --> 48:06.970
I'm about 160, 170 pages into the new thing.

48:08.791 --> 48:11.374
Well, I can tell you... You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

48:11.394 --> 48:11.834
That's all right.

48:11.994 --> 48:17.239
I mean, it's really nothing more than mere superstition, probably.

48:17.319 --> 48:23.125
But, I mean, I can tell you... Is it a similar kind of character, pathological character?

48:24.944 --> 48:27.647
Forget it.

48:27.667 --> 48:28.127
No, no, no, no.

48:28.247 --> 48:33.793
I can tell you very broadly that, again, it's a novel and that it's written, again, out of history.

48:33.833 --> 48:34.534
It's American.

48:35.935 --> 48:36.856
What was that word?

48:36.876 --> 48:37.377
American.

48:37.837 --> 48:38.438
It's American.

48:38.638 --> 48:39.880
So, I mean, it's fiction.

48:40.620 --> 48:42.322
It's written out of American history.

48:44.304 --> 48:45.565
Is it a pathology?

48:45.585 --> 48:46.727
It's a pathology.

48:46.747 --> 48:53.013
Yeah, it expands on, definitely expands on one of these pathologies that I've articulated.

48:53.033 --> 48:53.854
Well, there are similar techniques.

48:54.695 --> 49:21.124
I believe that there will be similarities, but the new book will be more complex structurally and will be more interior in terms of texture and will be very

49:21.593 --> 49:29.763
generally probably more challenging to the reader and hopefully, for that reason, more rewarding.

49:32.706 --> 49:37.312
It's in some ways a more ambitious book, I think.

49:37.632 --> 49:41.156
I mean, technically at least more ambitious.

49:45.241 --> 49:48.324
Have you got it solved in your mind?

49:48.345 --> 49:49.626
I'm not, it's not...

49:50.365 --> 49:56.153
I told you before, and I don't think I ever finished, that this will relate to what we're talking about.

49:56.173 --> 49:56.994
Do I have it solved?

49:57.334 --> 50:02.421
The quick answer to that is... No.

50:02.461 --> 50:06.366
I'm sneaking up on a solution, even as we speak.

50:06.787 --> 50:11.874
I said I was an agonizingly slow rider.

50:12.435 --> 50:15.058
And the thing about Raising Holy Hell was, you said, when did you know you had it?

50:16.780 --> 50:20.305
It came like nothing...

50:20.909 --> 50:22.491
had ever come for me before.

50:22.612 --> 50:24.455
It came almost in a rush.

50:24.815 --> 50:32.667
It flowed, it breathed itself through me as if I was a conduit onto the page.

50:32.928 --> 50:35.932
I had to race to keep up.

50:36.814 --> 50:47.170
I would write 12, 13 hours a day and then I would awaken in the morning and

50:48.500 --> 50:52.665
raced back to see what I had written, which I assumed would be utter dreck.

50:53.226 --> 50:54.026
I didn't trust it.

50:54.307 --> 50:55.328
I was suspicious of it.

50:56.029 --> 50:58.211
Nothing had come like this before.

50:58.732 --> 51:05.220
It wasn't necessarily that it came easily, but it came in a way that was uninterrupted.

51:06.301 --> 51:10.646
And I was able to pick it up always the next morning until I blocked there for a while.

51:12.488 --> 51:18.355
So I knew almost immediately that something was happening, and what I...

51:18.554 --> 51:26.486
discovered when I would return to the material in the morning was, it wasn't half bad.

51:28.249 --> 51:29.231
It wasn't half bad.

51:29.371 --> 51:33.858
Usually, when stuff comes like that to me, I have to throw it away.

51:34.278 --> 51:34.819
It's not very good.

51:35.260 --> 51:38.445
This was really, I thought, I was quite pleased with it.

51:38.485 --> 51:41.069
Now... Were you writing in the work process?

51:41.089 --> 51:42.070
Yeah.

51:42.090 --> 51:43.793
Yeah.

51:43.813 --> 51:43.913
Yeah.

51:43.933 --> 51:46.958
That almost makes it sound like it wrote itself.

51:47.191 --> 51:54.682
It didn't write itself, but it did have this quality of a life of its own.

51:55.002 --> 51:55.863
I can identify it.

51:55.943 --> 51:56.364
Do you know?

51:56.484 --> 51:59.008
It's so hard to articulate to people.

52:00.370 --> 52:02.493
I know I did an interview with John Keegan.

52:04.315 --> 52:08.080
I basically went through a similar experience.

52:08.100 --> 52:13.468
I mean, you asked me to recount the details of those 14 months when I was writing, and it's vague.

52:13.786 --> 52:17.772
I know I wrote my column every week, but I can't tell you what I wrote.

52:18.012 --> 52:24.442
I remember working every day, seven days a week, waking up, literally waking up with sleep.

52:24.482 --> 52:25.704
That's the way I found them.

52:25.724 --> 52:26.184
Exactly.

52:26.224 --> 52:27.807
They resolve themselves during my sleep.

52:27.827 --> 52:29.950
Yes, yes, yes, precisely.

52:29.970 --> 52:32.594
And they can't wait to get down and put it in there.

52:32.614 --> 52:32.954
Right.

52:32.974 --> 52:34.356
And it's perfect when you see it.

52:34.797 --> 52:35.658
I found it.

52:35.678 --> 52:36.159
You read that.

52:36.199 --> 52:37.902
That's the solution to the problem.

52:37.922 --> 52:38.382
Right.

52:38.402 --> 52:42.308
Because I care about my writing and my transitions and the creature and everything came together.

52:42.541 --> 52:48.592
When I interviewed John Keegan, he said to me, he wrote about 14 books, and he's a great military writer from England.

52:48.612 --> 52:50.876
And I said, what book has been most satisfied?

52:50.896 --> 52:52.700
And I knew the answer, but I wanted to hear him say it.

52:52.740 --> 52:53.842
It's The Face of Battle.

52:54.603 --> 53:01.255
And he said, when I wrote that, and he used the phrase, I entered a zone.

53:01.636 --> 53:02.237
Exactly.

53:02.487 --> 53:07.214
That's a sports term, but having played sports myself, I know exactly what the zone is.

53:08.756 --> 53:10.738
I was there, but I wasn't there.

53:10.919 --> 53:12.481
I wasn't really in control.

53:13.062 --> 53:13.863
Right, exactly.

53:13.903 --> 53:17.408
Exactly what you just said to me.

53:17.788 --> 53:25.299
I've been to the 900 authors over the years, and I can't tell you how many really... Relate the same kind of process.

53:25.319 --> 53:30.286
Yeah, the authors that I respect, but it's a work of passion, and it's a work of dedication and feeling.

53:31.107 --> 53:31.347
I mean...

53:31.546 --> 53:36.172
have immersed yourself in the work, and you rely on yourself to be immersed in it.

53:36.372 --> 53:37.774
This thing happens.

53:37.854 --> 53:39.516
It's an alchemy, and I can't explain it.

53:39.536 --> 53:40.157
Exactly, it is.

53:41.058 --> 53:41.999
But that's one hat.

53:43.121 --> 53:48.768
Now, it would be disingenuous to say that that's just... No, no, no.

53:48.888 --> 53:59.241
You take that hat off, you throw it away, you put the other hat on, which is you self-censor yourself, you fiddle, you polish, you flenze,

53:59.390 --> 54:02.353
Which is some of the most satisfying... Yes, in its own way.

54:02.513 --> 54:04.675
But you're dealing from a different hemisphere of the brain.

54:05.255 --> 54:11.281
For me, the other stuff, and I resist it, but I don't resist it, is the actual composition and creative stuff.

54:11.301 --> 54:13.803
I love the... Right.

54:13.823 --> 54:14.463
You're like I am.

54:15.224 --> 54:18.087
Well, Alan said before, I mean, we're exactly the same.

54:18.127 --> 54:20.189
To the last minute, you can't let it go.

54:20.789 --> 54:22.130
And it's every little thing.

54:22.210 --> 54:25.153
And finally, when it's beyond my control, I'm saying what about it.

54:25.173 --> 54:26.574
Because there's nothing I can... What can you do?

54:26.814 --> 54:28.536
But as long as I have a chance...

54:28.972 --> 54:29.713
to make it better.

54:30.534 --> 54:31.155
You're going to do it.

54:31.195 --> 54:32.557
I'm going to do everything.

54:32.657 --> 54:34.119
I'm going to lie.

54:34.139 --> 54:34.539
I'm going to scream.

54:34.559 --> 54:35.120
I'm going to beg.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.723
I'll do whatever I can to get the changes.

54:37.743 --> 54:41.067
And he basically dumps me up until the murder end.

54:41.328 --> 54:42.810
So you told me about the new work.

54:44.672 --> 54:47.295
Well, but the new work is coming, I must say.

54:47.315 --> 54:48.857
Then don't go into it anymore.

54:48.877 --> 54:49.318
No, that's all right.

54:49.338 --> 54:51.781
It's not coming in quite the same way.

54:51.821 --> 54:56.667
There may be, there have been portions of it that have, but then for some reason it

54:57.085 --> 54:58.167
It doesn't sustain.

54:58.187 --> 55:00.752
Now having, now you're 43.

55:01.453 --> 55:01.593
Yeah.

55:01.613 --> 55:04.499
And obviously you've embarked on a new career.

55:04.519 --> 55:05.821
Yeah.

55:05.841 --> 55:11.171
Is this basically what you feel that you've, having played sports as you just said?

55:11.191 --> 55:11.291
Yeah.

55:11.311 --> 55:13.355
Is this what you've trained for all your life?

55:13.375 --> 55:15.499
Is this kind of making it to the show?

55:15.519 --> 55:19.346
I mean, becoming an office.

55:19.366 --> 55:19.667
Well,

55:20.018 --> 55:21.820
I have to say, for me, I'm 52.

55:22.882 --> 55:29.830
I knew this book would come, whether it was going to be sooner or whether it was going to be later, but it was in me to do this.

55:30.651 --> 55:35.537
And I have to feel that, you know, when you're using those words earlier, casting about, it was there.

55:36.298 --> 55:37.520
You were ready.

55:37.540 --> 55:39.122
You had done your journalism.

55:39.522 --> 55:40.744
Your wife was working.

55:41.602 --> 55:44.605
God bless wives who are willing to indulge husbands.

55:44.625 --> 55:48.289
Well, the book's dedicated to her, and, you know, it's without a doubt.

55:48.569 --> 55:51.412
She gave me emotional permission to do it.

55:51.992 --> 55:54.535
Once I started doing it, she was nothing but supportive.

55:54.975 --> 56:01.162
And let's not even talk about the financial aspect of it.

56:01.182 --> 56:01.682
Ditto, ditto, ditto.

56:01.702 --> 56:01.822
Yeah.

56:01.842 --> 56:02.343
Ditto, ditto, ditto.

56:02.363 --> 56:03.324
I mean, I've got two kids.

56:03.984 --> 56:07.208
I quit my newspaper job four and a half years ago.

56:07.228 --> 56:08.689
Hey, you've got two kids.

56:09.110 --> 56:10.291
You've been quitting the job.

56:10.411 --> 56:11.592
You're not getting any compensation.

56:11.740 --> 56:14.124
So there was no medical insurance that came with that.

56:14.685 --> 56:21.415
I walked, and it was for the... Of course, we have a contract with Brandeis, which made that doubly brutal.

56:23.098 --> 56:32.392
But it was with the expectation that we were making a dramatic career change that would involve some hard times, which continued.

56:32.552 --> 56:34.255
But I think we've rounded the corner on it.

56:34.454 --> 56:36.476
Well, I can remember the conversation.

56:36.516 --> 56:58.282
It was in Baltimore in a place called the Kent Lounge, late at night in the wee hours over Ailes, and she was pregnant, and we were in the midst of an economic recession, and it made absolutely no sense at all, except that it made even less sense to continue to do what I was doing.

56:59.023 --> 56:59.644
Which was where?

56:59.664 --> 57:01.026
It was newspaper.

57:01.046 --> 57:03.769
I was just, I won't say I was burnt out,

57:04.205 --> 57:05.507
but I was certainly fed up.

57:06.368 --> 57:10.074
And she just said, you must, what is it you want to do?

57:10.174 --> 57:17.004
And out of my mouth, much to my surprise, came, I want to write a novel.

57:17.525 --> 57:19.628
And she said, well, then, that's what you must do.

57:20.149 --> 57:22.713
And just for the record, I know you've dedicated the book to your wife.

57:22.773 --> 57:26.579
Her name are the kids and give you the biographical stuff.

57:26.599 --> 57:27.861
Oh, her name?

57:28.101 --> 57:29.062
Yeah.

57:29.082 --> 57:30.344
Oh, it's Susan Silkwood.

57:31.606 --> 57:33.008
She's here.

57:33.129 --> 57:33.469
Right.

57:33.922 --> 57:36.806
And I have one son who's 13 years old.

57:36.846 --> 57:37.688
His name is Bryce.

57:38.449 --> 57:39.030
We are wise.

57:39.190 --> 57:39.791
Senior, right.

57:40.271 --> 57:40.512
Right.

57:41.974 --> 57:42.535
Only child.

57:45.820 --> 57:46.200
I don't know.

57:46.220 --> 57:48.524
We've been married 15 years.

57:50.607 --> 57:54.232
No one else... She must be so proud.

57:54.252 --> 57:59.019
She's... I think, yeah, it's beyond that.

57:59.580 --> 58:03.726
She's really thrilled with it, and she keeps urging me to be proud of it.

58:04.246 --> 58:12.499
I am, but I'm humbled more so by what's happening.

58:12.959 --> 58:20.912
Still, I don't know why I feel a need to somehow, I used the word wary before.

58:20.952 --> 58:22.915
Distance yourself.

58:23.696 --> 58:26.380
Yeah, I mean, I... Oh, are you anxious?

58:27.001 --> 58:27.622
Am I anxious?

58:27.762 --> 58:29.545
I wake up anxious.

58:29.778 --> 58:33.303
I mean, I wake up in a state of anxiety, go to bed in a state of anxiety.

58:33.323 --> 58:36.487
Well, you think about the reception of the book?

58:36.507 --> 58:37.208
Oh, well, of course.

58:37.268 --> 58:41.554
I mean, it would be inhuman not to be, I think.

58:41.774 --> 58:48.143
I mean, I want readers, you know, just like anyone else.

58:48.303 --> 58:55.373
I have a column that I basically give away just to get readers, literally.

58:56.455 --> 58:58.958
If I got Kansas, I could give you ten bucks just to get in there.

58:59.275 --> 59:16.378
My fondest hope for this work would be that it be read by those who would be in some manner touched by reading it.

59:16.519 --> 59:27.814
And if that's, you know, if that's 10,000 readers or 5,000 readers or 100,000 readers or however many readers it is, I would just hope that it somehow word gets out and they...

59:28.250 --> 59:31.493
can get this book in their hands and read it, and get something from it.

59:32.234 --> 59:34.716
It's not a quantitative point of thing so much.

59:34.736 --> 59:38.299
Did you have a specific reader in mind when you were writing it, or did you write it yourself?

59:38.319 --> 59:39.200
No, I didn't neither.

59:39.260 --> 59:42.083
The answer to that is that I didn't either.

59:42.103 --> 59:49.930
I neither wrote it with a reader in mind, which I feel is, for any author of serious fiction, dead.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.954
And I didn't write it for myself, to please myself.

59:54.034 --> 59:57.717
I mean, I think I indicated to you before, if I wrote it to please myself, it would have been a different book.

59:59.047 --> 01:00:00.770
Well, but who was the reader?

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:03.774
I haven't the foggiest.

01:00:04.636 --> 01:00:11.146
I wrote this book according to what it needed to be, period, and just put it out there.

01:00:12.247 --> 01:00:19.258
I didn't have a market for my reader in mind, and I did not write it to please myself.

01:00:19.418 --> 01:00:24.646
Well, did you see it as a commercial fiction, literary fiction, neither both?

01:00:26.149 --> 01:00:27.130
I mean, you didn't even think about it.

01:00:28.763 --> 01:00:32.608
I didn't, well, I don't know what I say here.

01:00:33.188 --> 01:00:46.665
I mean, I... I just want you guys to know I'm still here.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:55.716
I know that those are terms that are used in the publishing business to kind of, you know, buttonhole or pigeonhole words work.

01:00:56.894 --> 01:01:02.736
I did not, I did not, there's nothing, look, there's nothing wrong with commercial fiction.
