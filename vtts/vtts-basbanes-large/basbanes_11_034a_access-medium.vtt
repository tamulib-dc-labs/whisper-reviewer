00:02.275 --> 00:05.478
I mean, do you want me to start, you know... You're talking to Victor Burch, yeah.

00:05.498 --> 00:08.742
Yeah, I mean, how I got started.

00:08.962 --> 00:10.764
Well, let's start, let me start with a question.

00:10.984 --> 00:17.511
I remember the first time you and I met, it's got to be six years ago, you gave me a card that said, Victor Burch, literary detective.

00:17.551 --> 00:17.831
Right.

00:18.011 --> 00:19.253
Do you still have that card?

00:19.273 --> 00:21.215
Do you still consider yourself... I still have that card.

00:21.295 --> 00:27.361
I still do literary detection on a pretty refined basis.

00:27.381 --> 00:29.363
Can you tell me what a literary detective is?

00:29.967 --> 00:42.623
Well, a literary detective is really one who uncovers literary works that either are anonymous, are pseudonymous, lost forever.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.607
Not really once I find them.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.351
So that's the sort of thing I enjoy doing.

00:49.912 --> 00:51.834
That's really the fun of it, you know.

00:53.316 --> 00:55.519
I don't know if you...

00:56.309 --> 01:07.365
No, a book that came out about Louisa May Alcott within the past year or so of nine stories that were recently discovered.

01:08.066 --> 01:10.850
And I was the one that uncovered them.

01:10.870 --> 01:11.291
All nine?

01:11.811 --> 01:12.693
All nine.

01:12.993 --> 01:13.714
Tell me about that.

01:14.335 --> 01:19.222
Well, I have been in contact with Madeline Stern.

01:19.763 --> 01:20.905
She's the expert.

01:20.925 --> 01:23.228
She's the expert on Louisa May Alcott.

01:23.748 --> 01:25.130
I'm just checking my speed here.

01:25.170 --> 01:25.591
That's all.

01:25.831 --> 01:26.632
You just keep going.

01:28.134 --> 01:29.015
You just keep talking.

01:29.156 --> 01:35.164
And, you know, we had, you know, exchange letters and stuff like that.

01:36.126 --> 01:45.058
And one time I just, you know, figured, well, I went through one of her bibliographies and there were things there that they couldn't find, you know.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.583
They said she had written them, you know, but they didn't know where.

01:49.785 --> 01:51.207
And how did they know about them?

01:51.592 --> 01:53.695
Well, they were in her day book, you know.

01:53.715 --> 01:54.035
I see.

01:54.055 --> 01:55.697
In her, you know, record keeping book.

01:56.779 --> 02:07.632
And I figured I would go through the record keeping book and just, you know, make sure that these were the ones that were not known.

02:08.994 --> 02:19.067
And I decided that, you know, the best way to tackle this would be to go through every periodical

02:20.752 --> 02:26.077
that was published by her publisher at the time, and that was Frank Leslie.

02:27.058 --> 02:28.580
Now, where did you find these?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.062
You must have gone to AAS or whatever?

02:30.142 --> 02:43.195
Well, yeah, I went, you know, to AAS, BPL, or wherever they had them, you know, and I went through all of them, and some of them matched up, no, the actual volumes.

02:43.896 --> 02:49.982
Some of them matched up, some of them didn't match up, but I had to read, you know, the text because sometimes

02:50.738 --> 02:57.985
She maybe didn't remember, or the publisher may have changed the title slightly.

02:58.646 --> 03:05.313
So, therefore, you know, by reading through the text, I figured this was the one that she wrote.

03:05.573 --> 03:07.575
Now, were these pseudonymously published?

03:07.595 --> 03:08.416
Anonymously.

03:08.536 --> 03:09.717
Anonymously published.

03:10.218 --> 03:17.725
So, how are you making the... So, really, what you have to do then is check the text that's published.

03:18.818 --> 03:22.703
Once the title matched, I didn't care, you know, because the title matched.

03:23.003 --> 03:31.914
But if it didn't match, then, you know, sometimes the title would have, you know, the person's name that was in the story.

03:31.954 --> 03:36.078
Then I would read the story and I'd say, oh, this is about that person.

03:36.479 --> 03:38.641
So are you doing textual analysis here?

03:38.802 --> 03:39.583
No, I don't.

03:39.963 --> 03:42.206
No, that's not my forte.

03:43.667 --> 03:44.168
Okay.

03:44.907 --> 03:48.319
Now, is this something you do as a hobby, or do you get complicated for this?

03:48.440 --> 03:52.334
Well, I mean, you know, maybe I get a copy of the book, signed, or something like that.

03:52.755 --> 03:57.111
I mean, you know, I figure I've gotten...

03:57.766 --> 04:00.710
enough out of the system that it's time to pay back.

04:01.631 --> 04:03.634
Tell me a little bit about that.

04:03.934 --> 04:08.079
Do you want to go back to my roots?

04:08.259 --> 04:15.088
Let's proceed as if that first interview we had didn't exist, because I took notes that day, and I'd like to make this a fresh interview.

04:15.128 --> 04:16.650
If you don't mind, if you've got the time.

04:17.011 --> 04:17.211
All right.

04:18.232 --> 04:19.714
I can give you my background.

04:19.734 --> 04:20.155
Okay.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.782
I grew up in the Roxbury

04:25.913 --> 04:38.927
Dorchester, Mattapan area, and I attended, you know, one of the most prestigious high schools in the country was, you know, Boston Latin School.

04:39.007 --> 04:45.915
There I got my language background, and I got to be pretty good in, you know, quite a few languages.

04:47.817 --> 04:55.245
And, but all the time, you know, I, you know, just a young boy growing up, and I became interested in

04:56.407 --> 04:59.090
like science fiction at the time.

04:59.190 --> 04:59.751
As a reader?

05:00.111 --> 05:02.915
As a reader, yeah, as a reader and a collector, too, you know.

05:03.355 --> 05:11.205
I mean, I made a business of just trying to collect everything that was, all the magazines about science fiction that were published.

05:13.347 --> 05:24.000
And at the time, you know, I would like, you know, work after school, and I would get, you know, maybe like five dollars a week.

05:24.706 --> 05:31.576
Out of that five dollars, half of it went to my mother, and part of it went to my car fair to get to school.

05:32.257 --> 05:35.862
Part of it went to, you know, maybe a lunch or two, something like that.

05:36.302 --> 05:41.189
And whatever was left at the end of the week was maybe 25 cents or something like that.

05:42.070 --> 05:53.186
When I got a dollar, I would go into Boston and go scouring through all the old news bookshops for all the magazines that I wanted to add to my collection.

05:53.206 --> 05:54.628
The magazines you were really looking for.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.366
Right, because they were the ones that really, you know, pushed science fiction.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.388
Any favorites of things?

06:01.408 --> 06:02.590
Do you remember any of the things?

06:04.572 --> 06:09.198
Yeah, you know, I read a lot of astounding and amazing stories.

06:10.219 --> 06:24.396
And then there were, you know, some adventure-type science fiction-y sort of things, like Operator 5, or G8 and his battle aces, that had, you know, elements of fantasy in them, you know.

06:24.882 --> 06:26.444
Now, give you an idea of when this was.

06:26.724 --> 06:34.034
This was like in, let's see, probably, I was about 12 at the time, probably 1936.

06:34.114 --> 06:36.638
So, roughly 1924.

06:36.698 --> 06:38.721
That's when I was born.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.783
So, you were about... I'm 70.

06:40.904 --> 06:42.265
I'm going to be 72.

06:42.386 --> 06:51.618
So, you know, with that sort of, you know, once I had that dollar, I would go in and blow it.

06:52.199 --> 06:54.602
Then I became interested in...

06:55.493 --> 06:59.719
the languages of the Near East, which meant, you know, the older languages.

07:01.342 --> 07:08.152
Not only Hebrew, but Tunei form, you know, Babylonian.

07:08.172 --> 07:11.497
Then I got interested in Egyptian hieroglyphics.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.565
Did you have any expectation at this point that you'd be a scholar?

07:17.046 --> 07:17.987
No, none.

07:18.007 --> 07:21.032
I mean, I knew that I would never go to college.

07:21.052 --> 07:21.833
Why did you know that?

07:22.033 --> 07:23.515
Well, my parents were poor.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.657
They didn't have the money.

07:25.244 --> 07:29.411
And my father was just an ordinary working man.

07:29.431 --> 07:33.577
And he couldn't afford to do it.

07:34.439 --> 07:36.462
And then, you know... Were you an only child?

07:37.263 --> 07:40.749
No, I had three own assistants.

07:40.769 --> 07:41.830
Were your parents immigrants?

07:42.672 --> 07:42.912
No.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.575
But my father was.

07:44.595 --> 07:44.975
From where?

07:45.236 --> 07:46.097
He came from Russia.

07:47.279 --> 07:48.841
To Wisconsin.

07:48.861 --> 07:50.023
A draft.

07:50.043 --> 07:50.784
Whatever.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.108
Yeah, well, I mean, they all did, you know.

07:53.594 --> 07:57.140
Is bridge your original name?

07:57.460 --> 07:57.881
No.

07:58.662 --> 08:02.969
It was changed, but I think I've tracked down what the origin was.

08:04.191 --> 08:05.333
Did your father use bridge?

08:05.914 --> 08:06.254
Yeah.

08:06.454 --> 08:10.641
He at one time was a bridge at one time before the crash came.

08:10.661 --> 08:11.943
Oh, really?

08:11.963 --> 08:12.164
Yeah.

08:12.464 --> 08:15.549
And he was in like the real estate business.

08:15.569 --> 08:16.110
In Boston?

08:16.430 --> 08:17.352
In Boston.

08:17.893 --> 08:20.597
He like built up, him and his brother built up like

08:21.438 --> 08:24.181
all those big apartment houses that are next to the museum.

08:24.381 --> 08:25.022
Oh, yeah.

08:25.262 --> 08:25.783
Well, that's nice.

08:25.803 --> 08:27.124
They owned all those.

08:27.144 --> 08:27.284
Really?

08:27.725 --> 08:29.747
And when the crash came, Zippo.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.210
It went, bye-bye.

08:33.691 --> 08:34.452
So, you know.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.754
So, you're talking about the Depression now, basically.

08:36.795 --> 08:36.975
Right.

08:36.995 --> 08:37.635
You know, wandering.

08:38.336 --> 08:38.857
Right, yeah.

08:39.898 --> 08:46.585
And, well, in Boston Latin School, I really became interested in languages.

08:47.780 --> 08:51.806
And that just kind of stayed with me, even in the service, you know.

08:52.427 --> 08:55.531
I always carried a bunch of books with me.

08:55.671 --> 08:57.053
Now, you were in the Navy, I think.

08:57.073 --> 09:03.422
Well, I was in the Merchant Marine for four years and in the Army after that for five years.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.164
Getting out of the Army when?

09:08.549 --> 09:09.631
Either the late 40s.

09:09.711 --> 09:10.632
So you were in the war?

09:10.983 --> 09:13.065
Well, I was in the war, yeah.

09:13.085 --> 09:13.746
The Merchant Marine.

09:13.766 --> 09:16.870
The Merchant Marine, mostly in the Merchant.

09:17.771 --> 09:19.593
I went into the Army before.

09:20.414 --> 09:22.877
Well, yeah, I was overseas, you know, with the Merchant Marine.

09:23.438 --> 09:35.852
But, when, as the war was winding down is when I went into the Army, because I figured, you know, the Merchant Marine were not going to get any benefits.

09:35.912 --> 09:36.673
The Army would.

09:37.314 --> 09:40.838
So, I went into the Army, and I spent five years there.

09:41.273 --> 09:48.860
But interestingly enough, one of my first jobs in there was working in a library.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.122
Fortuitous, huh?

09:50.222 --> 09:53.945
Well, it may have been, but it wasn't anything, you know.

09:54.406 --> 09:56.668
It took a great amount of brains.

09:56.688 --> 09:59.731
It was like removing the checkout slips.

09:59.751 --> 10:04.616
Like what I saw these guys doing this morning at the depository, big kites and putting things away.

10:04.956 --> 10:06.798
Well, I mean, we weren't putting things away.

10:06.818 --> 10:09.120
We were just taking, you know, they used to have a,

10:10.484 --> 10:15.268
slip in there when you checked out the book, you know, it would be dated.

10:16.009 --> 10:21.814
I guess this stuff didn't circulate anymore, and it was just taking that stuff out of there, you know.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.859
But that was my, you know, my biggest experience with the library.

10:27.800 --> 10:33.104
But, you know, I was a voracious reader as a kid, you know.

10:33.124 --> 10:40.491
I think when I was about maybe ten years old, I remember going

10:41.011 --> 10:55.485
to the American Public Library and ordering that they should get for me from the Boston Public Library, BOP's Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European Languages.

10:56.306 --> 10:56.867
B-O-P-P-BOP.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.108
B-O-P-P-BOP, yeah.

10:58.909 --> 11:10.360
BOP's Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European Languages, which sort of, you know, brought, you know, all the languages that they were, you know, really derived

11:10.913 --> 11:12.074
from the common source.

11:13.295 --> 11:17.779
It's always intrigued me, you know, this common source business, you know.

11:17.799 --> 11:20.442
Are you into symbiotics at all?

11:20.462 --> 11:21.803
No.

11:21.823 --> 11:28.650
Umberto Hecco recently wrote a book about an original language that may be a common source of what you talked, you know, that you're alluding to.

11:28.970 --> 11:29.350
Maybe.

11:30.451 --> 11:40.701
Uh, but, uh, it always fascinated me, you know, where mankind really started, you know, and what did he speak.

11:41.035 --> 11:44.739
So, you know, we got them talking, going back to the caveman days.

11:44.759 --> 11:44.900
Sure.

11:45.400 --> 11:51.567
But at any rate, you know, so that really got me interested in the languages of the Near East.

11:54.811 --> 12:03.541
And I always, you know, was very, you know, studious about the whole thing, you know.

12:03.561 --> 12:04.963
I just learned it on my own.

12:05.003 --> 12:05.724
What do you call it?

12:05.804 --> 12:10.249
Didactism or something like that.

12:12.592 --> 12:19.919
I could learn myself that I had a fairly good memory, so that kind of helped, too.

12:20.399 --> 12:22.661
This was in the years immediately following the war.

12:24.263 --> 12:26.064
No, I was interested in it before.

12:26.205 --> 12:28.507
But I mean what you're talking about now.

12:31.189 --> 12:33.191
You get out of the Army after five years, I think.

12:33.211 --> 12:40.658
I got out of the Army, and then I went to work for my father, who had bought a small delicatessen or something like that.

12:41.330 --> 12:47.877
And I worked for him God knows how many years, you know.

12:48.338 --> 12:52.523
And I think he sold the business.

12:52.703 --> 12:54.425
Where are we now, in the 40s or the 50s?

12:54.685 --> 12:57.108
We're probably in the 50s now.

12:57.128 --> 13:03.275
He sold the business, and later one of my friends bought the business, and I went in with him.

13:03.635 --> 13:05.037
So you worked at this for some time?

13:05.377 --> 13:05.617
Yeah.

13:05.758 --> 13:06.298
At the deli?

13:06.699 --> 13:06.879
Right.

13:06.939 --> 13:07.860
What was the name of the deli?

13:08.296 --> 13:09.197
Eli's Deli.

13:10.559 --> 13:11.019
Where was it?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.942
It was in Mattapan.

13:15.245 --> 13:17.227
A well-known deli?

13:17.447 --> 13:17.668
Huh?

13:17.688 --> 13:18.929
Was it a well-known deli?

13:19.370 --> 13:21.993
They make sandwiches or just sell stuff over there?

13:22.053 --> 13:22.474
Everything.

13:22.914 --> 13:37.813
So, at any rate, I had really become interested in this newly discovered decipherment of Linear A and Linear B.

13:38.232 --> 13:46.502
I love the image of a man working at a deli being fascinated by the decipherment of linear A. Do you know what it is?

13:46.582 --> 13:46.943
Yeah, sure.

13:47.023 --> 13:47.944
It's a hieroglyphic.

13:48.004 --> 13:51.108
Well, it was from Cleet, from Cleet, from the Island of Cleet.

13:51.568 --> 13:55.493
And supposedly in, you know, Greek style.

13:55.513 --> 13:56.935
I'm a good Greek, you see.

13:57.015 --> 13:58.777
Oh, that's okay.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.480
I don't speak any, but... Well, I do.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.022
I mean, I can read it, speak it.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.366
How many languages do you figure your fluent in?

14:06.903 --> 14:10.626
Well, I can get by in probably about 16.

14:10.947 --> 14:13.249
Very good.

14:14.390 --> 14:14.650
Wow.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.613
Self-taught knowledge?

14:17.633 --> 14:23.938
Well, it's either self-taught or, you know, like I learned to read Russian because I learned the Greek alphabet.

14:24.539 --> 14:27.402
But once you can read it, then you can use a dictionary.

14:27.882 --> 14:35.109
And once you can use a dictionary, you notice what terms, you know, well, right now I'm dealing with, you know, military aspects.

14:35.589 --> 14:36.690
So, you know, all the

14:37.548 --> 14:41.434
All the military terms in the Slavic languages tend to be the same.

14:41.454 --> 14:42.215
Military what?

14:42.275 --> 14:42.936
History?

14:42.996 --> 14:55.675
Well, right now I'm the activist of a group of Americans that volunteered to fight in Spain in 1936 and 1939, which was known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.520
I know the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.282
Quite a few Greeks went there.

15:00.302 --> 15:01.384
That's right.

15:01.664 --> 15:02.366
Very well known.

15:02.626 --> 15:02.906
Right.

15:03.607 --> 15:04.669
So I'm the activist.

15:05.273 --> 15:10.318
And these people, now this is the archivist for people who still survive from this, is that?

15:10.338 --> 15:14.382
Well, yeah, the organization, they have a veterans organization, that still survives.

15:14.963 --> 15:15.864
And that's based where?

15:16.064 --> 15:27.596
That's, well, the veterans are based in New York, but this is an organization that is made up mostly of academics who want to preserve that history.

15:28.697 --> 15:34.183
And it was, you know, formed at Brandeis.

15:34.568 --> 15:36.812
That's where I operate.

15:36.832 --> 15:42.381
So let's go back then to your fascination for linear B. Linear A. Linear A, I'm sorry.

15:43.023 --> 15:56.726
So, you know, with that fascination, when I wasn't working, I would go to, you know, some lectures given by one of the foremost scholars at Brandeis on that.

15:56.746 --> 15:57.628
I didn't go to Brandeis.

15:57.648 --> 15:58.990
You're probably in your 30s now.

16:00.016 --> 16:03.642
I'm a late bloomer.

16:03.802 --> 16:10.113
So am I. My first book was published when I was 52.

16:10.393 --> 16:13.559
I didn't learn how to drive until I was 55.

16:15.001 --> 16:22.193
My wife became disabled, and it was just a matter of survival.

16:23.455 --> 16:27.801
Uh, so I went to listen, you know, listen to a couple of his lectures and— Whose lectures?

16:27.982 --> 16:29.203
Did you name him?

16:29.263 --> 16:30.786
Professor Cyrus Gordon.

16:31.627 --> 16:31.727
Okay.

16:31.747 --> 16:36.534
The scholar in Eucharitic, which is another Near Eastern language.

16:37.535 --> 16:43.925
And he became fascinated with Linear A and Linear B, and also the Festus Disc.

16:44.505 --> 16:51.876
And the Festus Disc was this, like a wheel that was, it had pictographs on it.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.602
And it was found on one of those Greek islands.

16:54.742 --> 16:56.364
How do you spell Festus?

16:56.965 --> 16:59.687
P-H-A-I-S-T-O-S.

17:00.048 --> 17:04.572
P-H-A-I-S-T-O-S.

17:04.592 --> 17:05.193
Oh, look at that.

17:05.673 --> 17:05.773
Yeah.

17:05.914 --> 17:07.195
And it was found on one of the islands?

17:07.215 --> 17:09.717
On one of the Creighton islands, yeah.

17:09.738 --> 17:10.278
And what about it?

17:11.259 --> 17:17.605
And it was, you know, it had a, it was written in pictographs.

17:18.046 --> 17:20.108
And, you know, he'd been trying to decipher that.

17:20.543 --> 17:27.013
So, you know, I just lent, you know, some of my humble expertise, and he looked at me, you know.

17:27.073 --> 17:27.894
So you volunteered?

17:27.914 --> 17:29.677
You went on this after election?

17:29.697 --> 17:31.800
Yeah, after election, I went out and I stopped talking to him.

17:32.301 --> 17:37.669
And he says to me, together, going, I think, you know, going to school.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.212
He asked you if you'd ever thought of going to school?

17:40.373 --> 17:41.755
Right, you know, going to college.

17:41.775 --> 17:42.976
I said, yeah, I thought about it.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.619
My father couldn't afford it, you know.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.745
So he says, well, Brandeis, you know, has a program whereby

17:49.366 --> 17:55.833
they will acknowledge, you know, previous learning, even after your own, and they will give you credit towards it, you know.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.937
And this is Brandeis at its very earliest stages.

17:58.957 --> 17:59.277
Right.

17:59.377 --> 18:03.061
I mean, it was established in... Established in 1948.

18:03.141 --> 18:06.946
Yeah, so this is within ten years of its formation, right?

18:07.026 --> 18:07.627
Right, right.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.750
And this gentleman, Dr. Gordon... Cyrus Gordon.

18:10.770 --> 18:11.511
...is teaching there.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.153
Right.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.295
And so you introduced yourself to him.

18:15.335 --> 18:16.977
He was impressed by your...

18:17.530 --> 18:21.434
By my, yeah, by my knowledge, yeah.

18:21.454 --> 18:29.524
And, you know, maybe at the time, you know, I may be the only one of those students that understood what he was talking about, you know.

18:30.465 --> 18:41.878
And he says, well, we do have a program, you know, where we recognize, you know, this autodidactiveness, you know, and we can, you know, see if we can get you in here, you know.

18:42.458 --> 18:45.241
I said, well, I couldn't go except on a part-time basis.

18:45.602 --> 18:46.643
He says, that's okay, you know.

18:47.838 --> 18:51.061
So he, you know, expedited it, and I got in there.

18:51.101 --> 18:53.863
And this is at an undergraduate level or graduate level?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.044
What level did you get in?

18:55.285 --> 18:58.788
I have no bachelor's degree, but I went there to get a master's.

18:59.929 --> 19:00.229
Really?

19:00.509 --> 19:00.770
Right.

19:00.930 --> 19:01.710
Isn't that wonderful?

19:01.871 --> 19:04.012
Yeah.

19:04.032 --> 19:06.415
So they kind of gave you credit for... Right.

19:07.275 --> 19:15.803
Now did you have to take any tests, or was this... The only test I think I had to take was at the end was a French...

19:16.407 --> 19:19.510
languages then to see, you know.

19:19.570 --> 19:20.130
Isn't that great?

19:20.150 --> 19:20.251
Yeah.

19:20.311 --> 19:21.652
So you were awarded the Masters?

19:22.713 --> 19:23.093
Yeah.

19:23.113 --> 19:24.034
And what year was that?

19:24.054 --> 19:25.395
That was in 1966.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.496
1966.

19:26.757 --> 19:29.119
After how many years of studying were it?

19:29.139 --> 19:31.561
Well, let's say 42 years.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.663
No, maybe 30 years of studying.

19:34.023 --> 19:35.985
No, I mean... Oh, you mean there?

19:36.085 --> 19:36.926
Formal study.

19:37.206 --> 19:38.388
There?

19:38.408 --> 19:40.810
I think I went three or four years, I think.

19:40.830 --> 19:41.490
Three or four years?

19:41.651 --> 19:42.551
Yeah, part-time.

19:42.631 --> 19:45.334
And what was the degree in?

19:45.652 --> 19:51.699
Well, it was in, at that time, they gave, you know, degrees in what's called Near Eastern Studies.

19:51.719 --> 19:53.221
So it was a master's, an MA?

19:53.522 --> 19:57.507
Yeah, in Near Eastern, but I specialized in Egyptian higher levels.

19:57.527 --> 19:59.008
And did you write a paper, a dissertation?

19:59.028 --> 20:06.177
Didn't have to write a paper, just took my competency exam to see that I knew what the language was about.

20:06.197 --> 20:09.722
So this is 1966, so you're about 44 now.

20:09.982 --> 20:10.242
Right.

20:10.583 --> 20:14.207
So I, right away, you know, I graduate.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.396
And I said, what the hell am I going to do now?

20:17.416 --> 20:18.257
I got an M.A.

20:18.617 --> 20:19.738
I'm working in a deli.

20:20.559 --> 20:24.623
And, you know, gee, I've got to do something.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.364
I've got a master's degree, you know.

20:26.885 --> 20:31.549
So a lot of my friends were working at the library, you know, for the summer.

20:31.569 --> 20:32.029
BPL?

20:32.049 --> 20:32.490
At the BPL?

20:32.550 --> 20:33.811
Yeah, at Brandeis.

20:33.831 --> 20:34.752
For the summer, you know.

20:35.172 --> 20:37.594
So I said, maybe I'll go over there, you know, and inquire.

20:37.674 --> 20:39.416
Maybe I can work here in the summer.

20:40.477 --> 20:41.438
It's a part-time job.

20:42.579 --> 20:45.021
And I went there, you know, and...

20:45.895 --> 20:50.321
I spoke to the person who was the acting director then.

20:51.022 --> 20:52.705
They didn't have a full-time director.

20:53.846 --> 20:58.513
And in the meantime... At the library?

20:58.533 --> 20:58.773
Yeah.

20:58.874 --> 21:11.852
Prior to all this, you know, like maybe after World War II had ended, I did a lot of book scouting for George Gloss, who was, you know, the Brattle Bookshops.

21:12.085 --> 21:13.888
I was just here the other day.

21:13.908 --> 21:15.231
The Globe was doing a piece on me.

21:15.531 --> 21:16.132
Oh, yeah?

21:16.152 --> 21:18.156
And we took a shot down at the Brattle.

21:18.477 --> 21:18.817
Right.

21:18.837 --> 21:20.360
And his son, Kenny, is running the place.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.225
So, you know, I used to, you know, do some book scouting for him.

21:24.528 --> 21:25.690
I'm going to ask you about this.

21:25.730 --> 21:26.932
I'm doing another book for Holt.

21:26.952 --> 21:27.714
I'm doing two books.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.857
One is going to be on book hunting.

21:29.877 --> 21:30.318
Oh, okay.

21:30.899 --> 21:32.342
Tips for the beginners.

21:32.442 --> 21:34.566
Maybe you can give me some ideas about book scouting.

21:34.900 --> 21:35.921
I'm going to circle this here.

21:35.941 --> 21:38.043
We'll come back to it, all right?

21:38.063 --> 21:38.163
Okay.

21:38.524 --> 21:40.286
So you were out picking, so to speak?

21:40.366 --> 21:41.327
Yeah, right.

21:42.488 --> 21:49.215
And I figured out what's the best way to learn the kind of things that people are looking for.

21:49.816 --> 21:55.402
So I got a hold of, oh, what the heck, the guy that wrote the book on Americana.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.406
The name escapes me.

22:00.635 --> 22:01.696
Massachusetts guy?

22:02.157 --> 22:02.998
No, no.

22:03.018 --> 22:04.860
Not Frank Streeter, the great collector.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.561
No, no, no, no, no.

22:05.581 --> 22:06.462
He was a collector.

22:06.882 --> 22:11.988
This guy was, he wrote... No, I mean Tom Streeter, not Frank Streeter.

22:12.008 --> 22:12.149
Right.

22:12.469 --> 22:12.969
Frank Streeter.

22:12.990 --> 22:22.080
So, you know, I just started to look that over, you know, and he would give, you know, like he would mark something A, D, C, D, you know, according to what value, you know, he might have.

22:22.941 --> 22:24.343
And I just looked that over.

22:24.363 --> 22:26.305
I got to know Americana pretty good.

22:27.587 --> 22:28.768
After, you know,

22:29.744 --> 22:34.631
reading it for maybe six times, just familiarizing myself with it.

22:34.952 --> 22:42.523
So, when I went to speak to the guy at the library, you know, he asked me, you know, what did I know about librarians?

22:43.664 --> 22:46.749
You go there, you take books, and you read them.

22:47.570 --> 22:52.538
But, you know, he was kind of impressed with my knowledge of Americana.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.625
He said, you know, Brandeis is looking for a rare book librarian.

22:58.043 --> 23:02.169
I mean, this is like, you know, being in the right place at the right time.

23:02.189 --> 23:03.551
Who's this you're talking to again, though?

23:04.032 --> 23:05.514
He was the acting director.

23:05.534 --> 23:06.195
Do you know his name?

23:06.996 --> 23:10.041
Oh, God, it was on the tip of my tongue.

23:11.022 --> 23:13.206
Tarlin, Mr. Tarlin.

23:13.346 --> 23:13.827
Tarlin?

23:14.027 --> 23:15.609
Yeah, T-A-R-L-I-N.

23:17.031 --> 23:18.213
Okay.

23:18.233 --> 23:26.886
So he advised you that the rare books... Well, that the Brandeis was what I, you know, like to...

23:27.625 --> 23:28.766
considered the job."

23:28.966 --> 23:30.167
I said, yeah.

23:30.187 --> 23:31.569
Have they ever had one at that point?

23:32.309 --> 23:32.369
No.

23:32.390 --> 23:37.394
So they were at this point deciding that they're going to form a special collections division.

23:37.414 --> 23:37.695
Right.

23:37.715 --> 23:39.316
And they needed somebody to head it up.

23:40.197 --> 23:40.317
Right.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.359
He said, but you've got to promise me one thing.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.141
I said, what's that?

23:44.161 --> 23:48.225
He said, you have to go get another master's degree in library science.

23:48.845 --> 23:49.486
Where'd you do this?

23:49.726 --> 23:50.266
Simmons?

23:50.306 --> 23:52.529
Yeah, yeah.

23:52.549 --> 23:53.369
So I did.

23:53.409 --> 23:56.092
And I went through that part to it.

23:56.132 --> 23:57.193
So did you get the job?

23:57.950 --> 23:58.811
prior to this?

23:59.132 --> 24:03.278
Well, they were, like, simultaneously.

24:03.298 --> 24:05.221
How long did it take you to get the second Master's?

24:06.083 --> 24:07.004
I think three years.

24:07.124 --> 24:08.607
And is this an MS or an MA?

24:08.847 --> 24:09.768
It's an MS.

24:09.788 --> 24:11.251
In Library Science.

24:11.591 --> 24:12.292
Right.

24:12.312 --> 24:13.895
MSLS.

24:14.075 --> 24:15.758
MSLS, that's what it is?

24:15.778 --> 24:16.459
I think that's it.

24:16.479 --> 24:17.380
So you have two Master's.

24:17.460 --> 24:17.841
Right.

24:17.981 --> 24:18.702
Did you keep going?

24:18.803 --> 24:20.826
Anything after that?

24:20.886 --> 24:20.946
No.

24:20.966 --> 24:22.408
Were you protected by the PhD?

24:22.468 --> 24:22.809
No.

24:22.949 --> 24:23.250
No.

24:24.732 --> 24:26.134
No.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.224
So, you became Director of Special Collectors?

24:31.244 --> 24:37.769
Well, I became, well, I don't know if they had a name for it then, but I became the head of Special Collectors.

24:37.829 --> 24:48.438
And then, you know, while you're there, you know, you're constantly learning, you know, because working in a library is, you know, educating yourself every single minute.

24:49.439 --> 24:56.425
And I believe in that, you know, that people should educate themselves as long as they're alive.

24:56.962 --> 25:00.467
And, and so, let's get a date on this.

25:00.507 --> 25:04.893
When did you become, assume this job at Brandeis, of the rare books?

25:05.334 --> 25:06.215
Well, let's see.

25:06.275 --> 25:09.059
It's probably about 10 years since I was out of Brandeis, as that.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.163
So, that's 66, 76.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.107
And I was there 20...it was probably 67.

25:14.167 --> 25:18.713
So, 67 to 87 you had this?

25:18.733 --> 25:19.655
22 years, yeah.

25:19.675 --> 25:20.696
So, to 89?

25:21.097 --> 25:21.197
Yeah.

25:21.532 --> 25:24.416
So it was 67 to 89.

25:24.917 --> 25:25.478
Something like that.

25:25.498 --> 25:26.259
Approximately.

25:26.439 --> 25:27.781
I can't remember.

25:27.801 --> 25:28.822
But it was 22 years.

25:29.143 --> 25:29.443
Yeah.

25:31.246 --> 25:40.279
And then, you know, I tried to, you know... This I don't want to go in the book.

25:40.299 --> 25:40.660
Okay.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.043
Administrators know shit about books.

25:44.625 --> 25:47.269
They know how to administrate, but when it comes to books...

25:47.553 --> 25:49.355
They don't know anything, you know.

25:49.375 --> 25:50.617
So, were you an administrator?

25:50.877 --> 25:51.178
No.

25:51.398 --> 25:53.180
I mean, not really, you know.

25:53.601 --> 25:54.843
I didn't have any staff.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.728
So, this was a fledgling collection.

25:58.788 --> 25:59.048
Right, yeah.

25:59.068 --> 26:02.473
Did you acquire for them, or did you basically take care of stuff that they had?

26:02.493 --> 26:02.793
I did, yeah.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.976
I was given a small budget, you know, to buy things.

26:05.417 --> 26:07.559
What kind of materials did you have at that point?

26:07.579 --> 26:11.805
Well, they had gotten an awful lot of contribution, you know.

26:12.123 --> 26:14.886
New School opening up for the Jewish communities.

26:14.906 --> 26:20.010
A lot of people who were book collectors, you know, gave their collections.

26:21.051 --> 26:24.174
So, they had, you know, a fairly amount of valuable material.

26:24.274 --> 26:29.479
Would you characterize it as really good material, useful material that supported the curriculum?

26:30.660 --> 26:34.844
Well, the library really didn't have a direction in which to go, you know.

26:34.864 --> 26:37.767
Did you try to establish one for them?

26:37.787 --> 26:41.370
Well, I felt that was up to the director, you know.

26:41.637 --> 26:44.080
to really initiate something like that, you know.

26:46.664 --> 26:53.493
It was at the point there, you know, where one faculty member said this, and another one was interested in his own thing.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.696
No, you know how it is, you know.

26:55.716 --> 26:57.278
It gets political, you know.

26:57.358 --> 27:07.211
So, you know, what did happen was that, you know, we did focus on this Spanish Civil War thing.

27:08.433 --> 27:10.716
The History Department bought a small collection

27:11.033 --> 27:14.979
And they asked the library if they would like to develop it.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.623
And it was given to me to develop.

27:17.823 --> 27:23.231
And I developed it to where it's now one of the most outstanding collections in the country.

27:23.792 --> 27:26.015
And how do you go about developing a collection like that?

27:26.997 --> 27:31.924
Well, first of all, you try to get, you know, first of all, you've got to look at bibliographies.

27:31.944 --> 27:39.235
And then you've got to try to buy as many books on that subject as you can.

27:39.417 --> 27:43.901
Are you looking for books or primary materials or both, manuscripts, everything, right?

27:43.921 --> 27:44.682
Well, yeah.

27:44.702 --> 28:02.919
And then, you know, after a while, my really interest really became intrigued in that because at that particular period of time, people who were writing, you know, political material were never using their right name.

28:02.959 --> 28:04.620
And that intrigued me also.

28:05.381 --> 28:07.243
Who were these people that were writing?

28:07.443 --> 28:08.884
So this may even have been...

28:10.332 --> 28:16.259
the beginning of this, what became this fascination for literary detection, is that right?

28:16.319 --> 28:22.366
Can you give me a couple of examples of people who maybe rode under Sudan?

28:22.446 --> 28:39.445
Most of them were Spanish, you know, although, you know, some of the ones in the United States, their names became pretty well known, you know, after a while, but you'd have to dig them out in, you know, political

28:43.458 --> 28:46.562
and stuff like that, and they would use a different name.

28:47.624 --> 28:52.971
Those that wrote for, you know, retirementists and socialists would never use their real name.

28:52.991 --> 28:55.194
So these were more or less noms de guerre, sort of?

28:55.214 --> 29:00.861
Yeah, well, noms de guerre, noms de partie, something like that.

29:00.902 --> 29:10.174
And that sort of intrigued me, and I got in touch with a

29:11.504 --> 29:19.792
with a scholar in France, who was an American, by the way, who had really specialized in building up collections like that, you know.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.614
He was interested in the Spanish Civil War.

29:23.435 --> 29:33.925
He had built up a really big collection that he sold to Berkeley, and then he had, after he sold that, he started in again and built up this collection.

29:33.945 --> 29:35.847
Well, I became, you know, pretty much interested.

29:35.867 --> 29:36.888
Do you remember his name?

29:36.908 --> 29:38.549
Yeah, Herbert Southworth.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.810
Herbert Southworth.

29:39.971 --> 29:40.431
Right.

29:40.698 --> 29:43.081
And he was a pretty major collector, you'd say?

29:43.281 --> 29:44.402
He's a major collector.

29:44.442 --> 29:45.504
He, uh... He's still around?

29:46.485 --> 29:47.526
Self-worth?

29:47.626 --> 29:49.308
From what I heard, yeah.

29:49.448 --> 29:53.173
He's fairly way up there, maybe close to 90 or more.

29:54.254 --> 30:09.051
He had worked for the Library of Congress, and also left that position to work for the Ministry of Propaganda, I think, of the Spanish government.

30:09.419 --> 30:14.848
He lived in France for a good deal of his life.

30:15.289 --> 30:28.210
Well, I shouldn't say a good deal of his life, but I think he married a woman who was in the French underground, and I went to visit him one time.

30:32.317 --> 30:35.983
This was really an amazing thing, you know.

30:36.233 --> 30:37.134
Was he a wealthy man?

30:37.254 --> 30:37.754
Huh?

30:37.774 --> 30:38.755
Was he a wealthy man?

30:39.076 --> 30:41.198
Well, I would say that he had a lot of money.

30:41.258 --> 30:48.905
But he had the means, certainly, to collect them at a level that institutions would find most interesting, I guess.

30:48.925 --> 30:49.165
Right.

30:51.027 --> 31:00.396
Before I went there, you know, my wife and I, we went to Paris, and we went down to see him.

31:00.416 --> 31:03.899
And I asked him, you know, what was his telephone number?

31:03.919 --> 31:05.160
He told me his number one.

31:05.917 --> 31:07.539
You know, number one.

31:08.140 --> 31:12.426
Okay, I said, when I get to this certain point, I'll call, you know.

31:12.446 --> 31:24.564
Well, we get to this certain point, we come south from Paris, and we get off at this railroad station, and I call up this number one, you know.

31:24.584 --> 31:28.449
And he answers, I'll be there in about 20 minutes, you know.

31:28.509 --> 31:31.013
He comes in this old station wagon,

31:31.550 --> 31:35.955
with cowboy boots and a cowboy hat.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.416
I guess he's originally from Texas.

31:38.257 --> 31:43.823
And it takes us, you know, like 20 minutes into the countryside.

31:45.184 --> 31:50.430
And we get to his house, and it's this big, big castle.

31:50.770 --> 31:51.130
Jeez.

31:52.432 --> 31:53.032
It was in France.

31:53.313 --> 31:54.133
Yeah.

31:54.153 --> 32:00.460
The castle had belonged to, what's it, Richelieu's sister.

32:01.233 --> 32:01.714
Oh, really?

32:01.994 --> 32:06.980
Yeah, at some point it belonged to her.

32:08.162 --> 32:17.034
So we got into this castle, and the only reason that he had number one, he was the only one who had a phone in that town.

32:17.094 --> 32:20.198
So, you know, it was quite an experience, you know.

32:20.218 --> 32:21.720
I just couldn't believe my eyes.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.941
Did he have books in this place?

32:24.183 --> 32:26.085
Were you just going to visit him to visit him?

32:26.165 --> 32:30.531
Well, I went to visit him, and, you know, just shot the breeze, and

32:30.815 --> 32:34.098
exchange information and stuff like that.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.761
Did he kind of set you on the direction of finding things?

32:38.583 --> 32:44.229
No, he knew that, you know, at some point we would come to him to buy some more books, you know.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.032
Did this carry his name at Brandeis?

32:48.052 --> 32:49.834
Was it called the Self-Worth Collection?

32:49.854 --> 32:55.300
No, because the Women's Committee at Brandeis put up the money.

32:56.841 --> 32:57.622
So he sold it.

32:58.022 --> 32:58.983
He sold it.

32:59.003 --> 33:00.585
It's not like he gave one.

33:00.835 --> 33:02.356
Yeah, that's a different story.

33:02.757 --> 33:04.859
But it was an important collection?

33:05.299 --> 33:05.980
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.482
Yeah, it really filled in, you know, a big chunk.

33:09.103 --> 33:15.749
And then I got to thinking, you know, what about the Americans that were involved?

33:15.769 --> 33:26.640
You know, I knew that there were, you know, plenty of Americans, and my only contact with them had been when I was in the American Marine,

33:27.869 --> 33:34.615
Some guys came aboard my ship, you know, sailors, said they had been in the Arab League again.

33:35.116 --> 33:39.940
To me, okay, you were in the French Foreign Legion, same difference to me, you know.

33:40.941 --> 33:43.524
I was completely apolitical as a kid, you know.

33:43.544 --> 33:46.587
I had no concept of politics.

33:50.370 --> 33:55.215
But I knew that, you know, there was a stigma attached to these people.

33:55.815 --> 33:57.657
I went down there and I talked to them.

33:58.042 --> 34:09.758
And, you know, after looking over a lot of books and things like that, there really is nobody here to preserve the role that the Americans played in that.

34:09.959 --> 34:11.340
This is back in the States now?

34:11.461 --> 34:11.801
Yeah.

34:12.542 --> 34:20.794
And I went down and I talked to a bunch of guys, you know, and they had, you know, this I don't want to go in the book either.

34:20.814 --> 34:23.738
They had had a bad experience with the New York Public Library.

34:24.519 --> 34:27.643
They'd given a lot of material to the New York Public Library.

34:28.231 --> 34:32.435
The New York Public Library microfilmed it and trashed it.

34:35.238 --> 34:35.559
Wow.

34:35.939 --> 34:40.964
And they had, you know, these posters from the war that were worth, I think, thousands of dollars.

34:41.024 --> 34:42.226
And they trashed it.

34:43.367 --> 34:44.228
That's amazing.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.930
So that, you know, really set them off, you know.

34:47.391 --> 34:50.534
So, you know, I said, that wouldn't happen, you know, in our collection.

34:51.135 --> 34:52.636
We're here to preserve everything.

34:55.239 --> 34:57.081
Just in the 70s now, would you say?

34:57.101 --> 34:58.002
Yeah, yeah.

34:58.589 --> 35:03.094
So, uh... So, Brandeis is the home, then.

35:03.114 --> 35:05.416
It's the repository for the Abraham Lincoln stuff?

35:05.637 --> 35:05.917
Right.

35:06.197 --> 35:13.465
Whatever documents, you know, that survived, uh, are here, uh, at our, you know, library.

35:14.366 --> 35:17.309
Uh, a lot of the documents, you know, some of them were destroyed.

35:18.451 --> 35:19.392
By a library?

35:19.812 --> 35:20.293
Uh, no.

35:20.773 --> 35:24.457
No, some of them were destroyed by the records themselves.

35:24.477 --> 35:26.459
Uh, because, you know, it's a McCarthy period.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.921
They had to hide stuff.

35:28.390 --> 35:37.244
We have to point out that the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, rightly or wrongly, was characterized as being... A subversive organization, yeah.

35:37.264 --> 35:44.595
I mean, you know, there were plenty that weren't, you know, but the FBI didn't care about that.

35:44.616 --> 35:46.358
I mean, as a scholar, that's quite irrelevant.

35:46.539 --> 35:48.762
The point is, it has to be... Right.

35:49.079 --> 35:50.881
documented and preserved.

35:51.021 --> 36:01.255
I mean, you know, like one time, you know, we had... Your politics are irrelevant here, and I don't want to know them, but as you said, you're apolitical and... Right.

36:01.695 --> 36:04.819
My objectivity was to preserve, to collect and preserve.

36:04.839 --> 36:13.230
It's like saying... I don't make the judgments, let the historians... I mean, you can apply the very same criteria to, you know,

36:13.447 --> 36:21.019
the Anti-Defamation League should not go out and document, you know, the activities of the Nazis or something like that, or the neo-Nazis.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.762
Of course you have to document it.

36:22.782 --> 36:22.902
Right.

36:23.183 --> 36:29.292
Well, I always found, you know, that usually your enemies know more about you than you do yourself.

36:30.474 --> 36:31.376
Okay?

36:31.416 --> 36:32.277
They do, you know.

36:32.998 --> 36:40.450
An example, when the first contingent of Americans went over to Spain,

36:40.868 --> 36:42.270
They left New York City.

36:42.290 --> 36:45.635
It was supposed to be very hush, hush, hush.

36:45.675 --> 36:48.438
They got off the boat in Sherbird or something like that.

36:49.860 --> 36:52.384
The next day, the French newspaper had their names.

36:55.368 --> 36:57.070
The French right-wing newspaper.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.993
Well, we used to say, loose lips think shit.

36:59.013 --> 37:05.662
Well, not loose lips, but I mean, you know, the left is watching the right, and the right is watching the left.

37:06.523 --> 37:09.627
And they're gathering information on each other.

37:09.647 --> 37:10.048
So...

37:10.501 --> 37:12.903
That's the way it operates, you know.

37:13.924 --> 37:15.946
So, okay.

37:16.426 --> 37:21.551
Then you retired from this position, I guess you said, in 89, I guess, right?

37:21.571 --> 37:22.192
Yeah, 87, 89.

37:22.352 --> 37:24.534
87, 89.

37:24.754 --> 37:28.017
But you still maintained an office there at Brandeis, I guess.

37:28.117 --> 37:40.508
Well, what happened was that another organization called the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, which is chartered as an educational institution, was founded.

37:41.045 --> 37:45.530
And they joined together with Brandeis, you know, as a mutual partnership, you know.

37:46.871 --> 37:51.757
And I worked for them, you know.

37:51.777 --> 38:02.569
So now recently, you know, we've started to get microphones of records that were housed in Moscow for over 60 years ago.

38:02.649 --> 38:06.974
And they're just Western sculptors and never seen them, really, you know.

38:07.314 --> 38:08.615
Is it interesting stuff?

38:10.097 --> 38:11.018
Very interesting.

38:11.217 --> 38:13.460
And are the scholars already working on it?

38:14.381 --> 38:23.552
Well, we haven't opened it up yet because there's a lot of logistical problems to have to be worked out with the microfilms and stuff like that.

38:23.573 --> 38:24.654
Now, who's microfilming it?

38:24.674 --> 38:25.575
Who's shooting it for you?

38:25.875 --> 38:28.339
Well, the Russians... And they're selling it.

38:28.619 --> 38:29.780
They're selling it, yeah.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.924
And they're keeping the original documents?

38:32.964 --> 38:35.908
The original documents are being kept at Moscow.

38:36.732 --> 38:44.600
So, let's move then over to the literary detection stuff and the stuff that you've been actively doing since you left.

38:45.280 --> 38:49.064
Well, I enjoy hunting out pseudonyms, you know.

38:49.925 --> 39:03.398
Writers, you know, that write under pseudonyms, especially famous ones that sometimes, you know, wrote in order to put bread on their table, they wrote, you know, these

39:04.593 --> 39:08.939
soft-core pornography, sometimes hard-core pornography.

39:09.700 --> 39:12.204
You know, it's a fast $500,000.

39:12.224 --> 39:17.311
We were talking about 20th century stuff?

39:17.531 --> 39:18.593
Yeah, 20th century.

39:18.613 --> 39:19.954
Recent stuff?

39:19.974 --> 39:21.797
Recent stuff.

39:21.817 --> 39:27.024
And how do you determine... I mean, I don't want to give away my detecting methods.

39:27.044 --> 39:27.745
Oh, I quite agree.

39:27.765 --> 39:33.233
Yeah, you know, but I mean, I use every available source that I have at my fingertips.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.615
Can you give me some examples of things?

39:36.635 --> 39:39.397
I use copyright records.

39:41.839 --> 39:43.381
Can you give me some examples of writers?

39:44.081 --> 39:47.925
Well, I'd rather not mention their names, you know.

39:48.345 --> 39:54.691
There's only one or two that I know that have, you know, admitted.

39:54.751 --> 39:58.755
One is Lawrence Block, who's a mystery writer.

39:59.755 --> 40:03.559
Donald Westlake, he's a mystery writer.

40:03.619 --> 40:04.840
He's admitted, you know.

40:05.157 --> 40:07.240
This is stuff they wrote for money.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.684
How do you find this stuff?

40:10.744 --> 40:15.871
I don't mean the actual records.

40:16.812 --> 40:19.976
How do you find the original material?

40:21.678 --> 40:32.953
Being a book collector at the same time, I always was interested in the stuff that falls in between the cracks that publishers don't make and are known.

40:33.490 --> 40:36.013
paperback books for a long, long time.

40:36.674 --> 40:38.817
Never got into, you know, books in print.

40:39.778 --> 40:40.159
Never.

40:40.819 --> 40:43.863
And they fell in between the cracks.

40:43.964 --> 40:58.562
Now, you know, from just working in AAS, you know, trying to figure out stuff that, you know, publishers published a hundred years ago, you know, this stuff just disappeared because no record was kept.

40:59.023 --> 41:02.147
And, you know, at one time, I was collecting...

41:02.380 --> 41:08.928
the paperback books of one publisher who had been in business since 1963 to 1973.

41:09.309 --> 41:17.879
That's 10 years of paperback publishing, maybe close to 3,000 paperbacks.

41:17.899 --> 41:18.981
Titles.

41:19.001 --> 41:19.161
Huh?

41:19.181 --> 41:19.561
2,000 titles.

41:19.681 --> 41:23.426
Well, titles and, you know, printings and stuff like that, some kind of it.

41:23.787 --> 41:25.929
It was called Lancer.

41:26.750 --> 41:27.631
How do you spell it?

41:27.651 --> 41:30.234
L-A-N-C-E-R.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.476
And when I start, you know,

41:31.895 --> 41:41.269
digging around the records there, like, who's writing what, you know, so that people there are usually seeing them, even for good stuff, you know.

41:41.289 --> 41:44.053
Well, what kind of stuff did they... Well, they published everything.

41:44.073 --> 41:45.695
They were, you know, into everything.

41:45.775 --> 41:50.101
I mean, they published hardcore, softcore, cookbooks.

41:52.645 --> 41:54.067
Did you get most of their titles?

41:54.087 --> 41:57.052
Did you get most of their... I got about 2,000 of them, maybe 25.

41:57.092 --> 41:57.713
You still have them?

41:57.833 --> 41:58.574
I still got them.

41:58.594 --> 42:00.096
You're gonna show me some?

42:00.565 --> 42:05.169
He'd be amazed.

42:05.189 --> 42:10.855
You told me once on the telephone or whatever that if you don't save this stuff, it's going to wind up in the dump.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.796
I mean, that was very bad.

42:12.816 --> 42:14.158
I don't think so.

42:16.480 --> 42:20.664
I'm more into the information rather than, you know, the actual book, you know.

42:21.124 --> 42:25.128
Although, you know, the books are starting to become worth money, you know.

42:25.148 --> 42:26.369
They're highly collectible.

42:26.449 --> 42:28.311
I've got to show you, you know, catalogs.

42:28.763 --> 42:33.148
where some of these things sell for more than a hardcover book.

42:33.168 --> 42:33.929
Yeah.

42:33.949 --> 42:36.031
So how did you get interested in this particular publisher?

42:38.174 --> 42:40.216
I just picked one out that did a lot of publishing.

42:41.658 --> 42:42.999
So you focused on one?

42:43.060 --> 42:43.300
Right.

42:43.420 --> 42:44.061
Yeah, right.

42:44.121 --> 42:48.506
I focused on some other, you know, collectors.

42:48.546 --> 42:50.688
They focus on another one.

42:50.708 --> 42:56.896
I mean, in paperback book collecting, there's many, many aspects that go into it.

42:57.296 --> 42:58.197
I mean, the covers.

42:58.582 --> 43:03.328
The artwork on the covers fascinates some people.

43:03.648 --> 43:18.627
Some will focus it down to artwork that have people with glasses where the image of somebody else is in the glasses.

43:18.667 --> 43:22.932
There's no end to what guys want to collect.

43:22.952 --> 43:25.095
There's absolutely no end.

43:25.750 --> 43:29.554
Is this stuff you started doing after you left your job, or...?

43:29.574 --> 43:31.756
No, I did it in between times.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.559
Then I collected pulp magazines, too.

43:34.579 --> 43:35.600
And where did you find these?

43:35.880 --> 43:36.481
Did you buy these?

43:37.322 --> 43:40.705
I buy everywhere, you know.

43:41.226 --> 43:42.807
I used to go to conventions.

43:44.909 --> 43:50.195
Can you name some of the magazines, some of the...name some pulp magazines for me?

43:51.656 --> 43:52.917
Well, Operator 5.

43:53.438 --> 43:55.420
I have some railings.

43:56.058 --> 43:58.761
called the Octopus.

43:58.882 --> 44:02.045
These came out in the 30s, you know, when I was growing up.

44:04.028 --> 44:05.510
Lurid colors.

44:05.930 --> 44:07.773
Really lurid colors.

44:08.714 --> 44:10.556
Then there was the Spicy Detective.

44:10.656 --> 44:11.898
Those were more lurid.

44:12.759 --> 44:14.000
Spicy Western.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.584
I'll show you some of that.

44:16.664 --> 44:18.446
I'd like to see some.

44:18.606 --> 44:18.826
Yeah.

44:18.866 --> 44:20.869
But then there were more, you know, the regular one.

44:20.889 --> 44:22.351
There was one called Agassi.

44:22.691 --> 44:24.113
Oh, Agassi's more famous.

44:24.313 --> 44:24.934
Right, yeah.

44:25.252 --> 44:27.916
which carried a lot of fiction.

44:32.082 --> 44:34.104
So you'd see these when you read them?

44:34.144 --> 44:36.227
Yeah, I mean, well, I don't even know if I'd read them.

44:36.808 --> 44:41.935
But you'd see the names of authors who clearly probably don't exist in any other, you know.

44:42.336 --> 44:43.498
Right, in any other format.

44:43.558 --> 44:45.320
I mean, they may have sold one story.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.724
Some of them may have sold ten stories.

44:48.084 --> 44:50.888
Some guys would be...

44:51.188 --> 44:55.694
Maybe they had three or four stories under three different names in the same magazine.

44:56.115 --> 44:56.555
You know.

44:56.655 --> 44:58.498
Evan Hunter used to do that, he told me.

44:58.638 --> 44:59.479
Evan Hunter.

44:59.499 --> 44:59.800
McBain.

44:59.860 --> 45:00.621
Yeah, McBain.

45:00.701 --> 45:02.243
He's used a dozen different names.

45:02.483 --> 45:02.704
Right.

45:02.944 --> 45:07.651
And I think Dutch Leonard has done a lot of that, too.

45:08.071 --> 45:08.732
Not too much.

45:08.832 --> 45:13.959
I think he used his name pretty much on his own.

45:14.580 --> 45:17.384
So you'd see some of these things, and maybe the writing's not bad.

45:17.404 --> 45:18.666
You'd say, who is this guy, right?

45:19.547 --> 45:20.368
But I mean...

45:21.091 --> 45:21.692
It was.

45:21.712 --> 45:23.235
That didn't interest me, the writing.

45:23.256 --> 45:25.180
The writing didn't interest me.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.587
The idea, you know, I want to know who it is.

45:28.607 --> 45:30.751
Is he a contemporary artist?

45:30.771 --> 45:33.958
If he isn't there, maybe he's somebody else.

45:34.699 --> 45:36.603
So what's the motivation here?

45:37.285 --> 45:42.255
Just knowledge, you know, just curiosity and knowledge.

45:43.450 --> 45:47.276
Did you see the page one story in the New York Times a couple weeks ago?

45:47.356 --> 45:53.205
They found a Alcott novel, and actually they found it about four years ago.

45:53.746 --> 45:55.789
They just authenticated it.

45:55.949 --> 46:00.055
But I'm amazed that they let it sit there all those years without coming out with it.

46:00.135 --> 46:09.930
I mean, you know, well, I mean, I have my own ideas about, you know, collecting.

46:10.450 --> 46:14.253
We go around, we collect all the office papers and everything like that.

46:15.915 --> 46:17.036
That's piddling.

46:17.476 --> 46:23.262
The real meat of research is in not the office papers, but in their agent's papers.

46:25.464 --> 46:27.626
Want to expand on that?

46:27.646 --> 46:30.629
Well, the agent is the one that sells the thing.

46:30.849 --> 46:39.917
If this guy wrote under different names, then you would know, because he had to make a check to that guy for selling, you know, this particular thing.

46:40.319 --> 46:43.383
And agents don't let go of their papers.

46:43.403 --> 46:47.169
I don't know of any agent that lets go of their papers.

46:47.189 --> 46:51.315
But that's where really some deep research could be done.

46:51.635 --> 46:54.880
Have you ever looked, have you ever had access to any agent's papers?

46:55.200 --> 46:56.041
No.

46:56.081 --> 46:58.825
I mean, I think there is one that I've read about.

46:59.346 --> 47:09.280
It's out in Oregon, you know, a guy who was an agent for, guys who wrote for Western Pulp Magazine, you know.

47:09.563 --> 47:12.226
So they're going to find a lot of pseudonym information.

47:12.726 --> 47:18.192
Well, to cite an example, right now, this anonymous, the guy who ever wrote Primary Colors.

47:18.212 --> 47:18.472
Right.

47:18.512 --> 47:24.398
The agent's, all the money's going to that agent, that agent's paying the author, and everybody's saying, who is the writer, who's the author?

47:24.498 --> 47:25.639
Well, the agent certainly knows.

47:26.300 --> 47:27.141
Right, absolutely.

47:27.661 --> 47:32.786
And, of course, her files are going to tell you quite clearly who this author is.

47:33.847 --> 47:34.428
Absolutely.

47:34.568 --> 47:38.372
Should these files ever go into... So, you know, that's where, you know, that's where you've got to use...

47:38.690 --> 47:47.721
every bit of acumen, you know, to find out, you know, what is available and what you can use for research.

47:47.902 --> 47:50.425
So what do you get out of it when you find something?

47:50.605 --> 47:51.086
Do you get a kick?

47:51.126 --> 47:53.869
No, I write, you know, I write articles, you know.

47:53.889 --> 47:57.234
And also, so do you write, you report your findings?

47:57.854 --> 47:59.196
A lot of times, yeah.

47:59.216 --> 48:01.078
And in what publications?

48:01.098 --> 48:03.802
Well, they're mostly fan magazines, you know.

48:05.985 --> 48:07.026
I mean,

48:07.732 --> 48:10.735
My interests are so broad, you know.

48:11.316 --> 48:29.073
I mean, I'm the sort of guy, you know, if I focus in, you know, on something I will become interested in, I'm going to learn all about that from A to Z. Right now, I sort of took an interest into silent film period.

48:29.093 --> 48:29.914
Silent film?

48:29.934 --> 48:30.334
Yeah.

48:31.876 --> 48:33.778
Mostly in biographical material.

48:34.478 --> 48:35.479
You write all this down?

48:35.499 --> 48:36.220
You take notes?

48:37.128 --> 48:39.250
I take a lot of notes down.

48:39.530 --> 48:41.032
I do a lot of, you know, research.

48:43.975 --> 48:48.219
I had been interested in it first from a literary, you know, viewpoint.

48:48.640 --> 48:55.787
What movies were derived from some literary piece, you know?

48:56.327 --> 49:01.853
And I noticed that, you know, quite a few were derived from stories that came out of the pulp magazine.

49:02.339 --> 49:09.567
Will you be able to furnish me at some point some examples of this, just so I can use in my, you know, for some specific examples?

49:10.308 --> 49:20.238
Well, what I'm doing now is through this, you know, I learned that, you know, a book had been published.

49:21.199 --> 49:24.202
It's called A Necrology of Silent Film Stars.

49:24.423 --> 49:25.204
Necrology?

49:25.404 --> 49:27.186
Necrology.

49:27.446 --> 49:28.807
Necrology.

49:29.108 --> 49:29.448
Right.

49:30.189 --> 49:32.211
And I looked at it and I, you know,

49:32.512 --> 49:40.984
The guy did a fairly good job, you know, because he would list, you know, all the sources he got his information from.

49:41.004 --> 49:45.570
And there was a lot of things that he missed.

49:46.872 --> 49:47.413
And who's he?

49:47.473 --> 49:48.294
Do you have his name?

49:48.314 --> 49:49.396
Yeah.

49:49.856 --> 49:52.480
He also publishes a... No, what's his name?

49:52.580 --> 49:54.042
Oh, Eugene Vazona.

49:54.643 --> 49:57.787
V-I-Z... G-Z-V-A-Z-Z-A-N-A.

49:57.928 --> 49:58.268
Okay.

50:00.151 --> 50:00.251
Yeah.

50:00.271 --> 50:01.152
And...

50:03.697 --> 50:07.483
So I've been, you know, sending him whatever information I get out.

50:08.665 --> 50:12.170
I'm not interested in, you know, publishing something myself.

50:12.230 --> 50:15.555
I just don't have the time to, you know, sit down and write.

50:16.176 --> 50:18.860
What I need, you know, is really a writer.

50:19.942 --> 50:21.384
So what you collect is information.

50:21.604 --> 50:21.864
Right.

50:21.925 --> 50:23.126
I'm an information buff.

50:23.988 --> 50:28.154
And I pass it on to the most appropriate person, you know.

50:28.174 --> 50:30.818
So who are some of the people that might be able to tell me about their

50:31.186 --> 50:32.648
their relationships with you.

50:32.668 --> 50:34.210
This guy Bazana might be one.

50:34.390 --> 50:35.371
Oh, yeah.

50:35.411 --> 50:36.072
Eugene V-A-Z-Z.

50:36.192 --> 50:36.953
Where would I reach?

50:36.993 --> 50:38.215
Where would I find him?

50:38.916 --> 50:42.681
Oh, well, he's like in between New York and Pittsburgh.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.865
I think he's getting ready to move back to Pittsburgh.

50:46.005 --> 50:47.567
The name of his organization?

50:47.767 --> 50:47.887
Huh?

50:47.907 --> 50:49.229
What's the name of his organization?

50:49.249 --> 50:50.971
Well, it's not an organization.

50:51.972 --> 50:59.522
He puts out a... Oh.

51:00.548 --> 51:03.591
He puts out this thing called The Silent Film Monthly.

51:03.611 --> 51:05.073
Oh, The Silent Film Monthly.

51:05.273 --> 51:06.534
Maybe there's a phone number here.

51:07.335 --> 51:09.397
Mmm, no, there isn't.

51:10.719 --> 51:13.441
The Silent... Yeah.

51:13.461 --> 51:13.922
...Monthly.

51:14.222 --> 51:17.005
Gene Vazana, 1407th Ave.

51:17.666 --> 51:21.810
That says New York, Adam, but he's getting ready to move back to Pittsburgh.

51:21.830 --> 51:22.431
One-oh.

51:22.451 --> 51:27.336
Probably famous number.

51:27.356 --> 51:29.959
I mean, I'll come highly recommend it from now.

51:30.119 --> 51:30.319
Yeah.

51:30.721 --> 51:40.712
I mean, this year was, what I had done was I traced back like one of the earliest stories about film.

51:40.772 --> 51:42.514
Can I get a Xerox of this?

51:42.594 --> 51:43.395
Sure, not right now.

51:43.495 --> 51:44.116
Oh, all right.

51:44.616 --> 51:46.759
I'll leave you in my card.

51:46.779 --> 51:49.242
Whatever you have that you could let me.

51:49.842 --> 51:51.724
Oh, I mean, I've published a lot of books.

51:51.744 --> 51:55.889
I've published some books, giving students in.

51:57.931 --> 51:58.652
Whatever happened?

51:59.054 --> 52:02.479
No, that's just trying to sell that book.

52:03.060 --> 52:08.748
But this was a story, you know, like anything else that I become interested in.

52:09.910 --> 52:19.183
There was an article I read about, you know, books about Hollywood, you know, film books.

52:19.564 --> 52:28.757
So, you know, in this article it said that, you know, the earliest story that they could find was somewhere in 1912, you know.

52:29.277 --> 52:33.604
and it was done a thing by, you know, some English publication.

52:33.624 --> 52:33.724
Yeah.

52:34.805 --> 52:47.985
I know this is asking a lot, but, you know, are there maybe a dozen or so different articles that you've written over the years that, that... Oh, I think I have a, somewhere I have a Vita.

52:48.526 --> 52:52.993
Yeah, but I mean, could I read some of them, get copies of some of them, to see some of the things that you've written?

52:53.013 --> 52:53.874
I don't even know if I have.

52:54.034 --> 52:55.176
Well, I do have some.

52:56.197 --> 52:57.900
A Vita would be terrific.

52:58.235 --> 53:11.114
And then, in addition to that, some of these articles like this one, so I can actually go with people that I work with, you know, work with, people that I have worked with at the library, you know, something like that.

53:11.975 --> 53:22.971
A friend of mine, you know, he was a pretty good scholar in Arabic manuscripts, you know, and Arabic printing.

53:23.733 --> 53:26.757
And, you know, I would, if I found something that, you know,

53:26.956 --> 53:30.140
that he didn't know about, I would, you know, contact him.

53:30.400 --> 53:37.409
He wouldn't write the article, but he would say, you know, he would, you know, whatever footnote, I would be there, you know.

53:37.770 --> 53:39.552
How often have you written for this photo?

53:39.572 --> 53:41.294
This is the first thing I had published.

53:42.015 --> 53:53.790
Now, one of the things that I did have, a couple of things, well, there's another article that I'm going to write there, and that's on the origin of the word photo play.

53:54.817 --> 54:01.344
I also like to beat out the Oxford English Dictionary in their dating of things, you know.

54:01.364 --> 54:02.966
You like to get earlier?

54:03.066 --> 54:03.326
Right.

54:03.927 --> 54:04.868
Have you done that often?

54:05.168 --> 54:07.150
Well, I did it with the word detective.

54:08.872 --> 54:14.958
That was published in an English fan magazine, detective fan magazine.

54:15.018 --> 54:16.860
And you found it an earlier citation?

54:17.681 --> 54:18.562
Which one did you find?

54:18.582 --> 54:19.443
Huh?

54:19.623 --> 54:20.464
The word detective.

54:21.005 --> 54:23.187
I mean, I found it like maybe

54:24.044 --> 54:26.087
four or five years before they started it.

54:26.668 --> 54:27.830
And did you give that to them?

54:28.611 --> 54:35.702
I haven't given it to them yet, but I'll do that when I send them both the photo play and this one together, you know, to them.

54:36.683 --> 54:40.228
It isn't too often that one beats them, but to beat them twice.

54:40.268 --> 54:42.812
So you found Detective?

54:43.453 --> 54:43.814
Yeah.

54:44.254 --> 54:45.256
Where did you find it?

54:45.476 --> 54:47.499
I was in the London Times.

54:48.581 --> 54:52.667
And what were you doing in the London Times?

54:53.305 --> 54:54.807
I was just looking for the word detective.

54:55.608 --> 54:56.389
No, wait a minute.

54:56.409 --> 54:57.570
You just went through the .

54:57.650 --> 54:59.593
I didn't go through the London Times.

55:00.094 --> 55:03.918
I went through the index of the London Times.

55:03.938 --> 55:05.861
Went through, and you saw the word detective.

55:06.442 --> 55:08.604
Right, and I wanted to see what that was about.

55:09.085 --> 55:15.533
And it was actually, it was about, you know, the guy on forming the first detective service in England.

55:15.817 --> 55:16.698
And there it was.

55:16.779 --> 55:18.021
And what was the year on that?

55:18.221 --> 55:19.303
I think it was 1839.

55:19.523 --> 55:22.408
And they had it down for 1844 or something like that?

55:22.428 --> 55:23.249
1842, you know.

55:23.690 --> 55:34.788
But the big argument is that, you know, if, the big argument is that if Poe had known that the word existed, he would have used it for Dupin.

55:35.389 --> 55:35.670
Okay.

55:35.690 --> 55:36.872
So there's a significance there.

55:36.972 --> 55:42.381
But he did not, but the word did exist when he wrote The Murder and the Remorse.

55:42.968 --> 55:43.729
It did exist.

55:43.749 --> 55:44.350
It did exist.

55:44.370 --> 55:45.552
He just didn't use it.

55:45.572 --> 55:46.553
Well, he didn't use it.

55:46.573 --> 55:50.058
I mean, he used rationalization or something like that.

55:50.258 --> 55:52.061
Well, there is a significance to it.

55:52.742 --> 55:53.122
Right, right.

55:53.182 --> 55:55.646
So is this what sent you to looking for the word?

55:56.227 --> 56:02.516
Because was there some kind of... Well, it just stood in the back of my mind, you know.

56:02.636 --> 56:04.358
Everybody was always saying this, you know.

56:04.378 --> 56:05.400
So now when did you do this?

56:05.840 --> 56:10.126
You just did this in an idle time, or the AAS, or... No, in an idle time.

56:10.787 --> 56:11.248
Where, here?

56:11.448 --> 56:12.790
Brandeis, probably.

56:12.770 --> 56:14.031
Just going through the index.

56:14.271 --> 56:14.532
Right.

56:14.772 --> 56:19.456
Going through the index, saw the word detective, focused in on it.

56:19.616 --> 56:22.519
And the word photo play is another one.

56:22.679 --> 56:33.088
The word photo play, they have given, you know, they cite an example that it appeared in the moving picture world on such and such a date.

56:33.509 --> 56:35.070
This is the OED we're talking about.

56:35.090 --> 56:35.450
Right.

56:35.490 --> 56:35.731
Yeah.

56:36.751 --> 56:40.735
And, yeah, it did appear on that date, but it did appear earlier.

56:41.440 --> 56:45.465
they didn't know was that it was a contest.

56:45.485 --> 56:51.131
And the winnings of the contest were announced in this moving picture world.

56:51.552 --> 56:53.995
And they said, this is the word that won, you know.

56:54.035 --> 56:54.956
Now, how did you find this?

56:55.457 --> 56:58.100
By reading in the moving picture world.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.082
Well, what prompted you to go looking for this?

57:00.963 --> 57:02.665
Why were you looking for photos?

57:02.685 --> 57:08.612
Well, I, well, when I saw the, first I found, I wasn't looking for the word photo, first I saw

57:09.740 --> 57:11.863
You might have been looking for something else.

57:12.163 --> 57:16.749
Well, I was looking for, you know, stuff for this guy here, you know.

57:17.169 --> 57:21.955
And then I, you know, I read the story about, you know, that this happens as a contest.

57:22.015 --> 57:23.757
And I said, gee, when was that?

57:23.977 --> 57:25.980
So then I went out and looked it up in the OED.

57:27.342 --> 57:30.125
And they had it, you know, like maybe two months later, you know.

57:31.326 --> 57:31.767
What year?

57:32.968 --> 57:37.594
I think it was 1912, I'm not sure.

57:37.614 --> 57:38.295
Okay.

57:38.832 --> 57:40.253
So, that's kind of fun.

57:40.273 --> 57:40.534
Right.

57:40.574 --> 57:43.056
And these are both recent discoveries in your part.

57:43.076 --> 57:44.217
Right, yeah.

57:44.237 --> 57:46.960
So, are you going to send this to the OED?

57:47.841 --> 57:50.163
The other one, the detective one, has been published.

57:50.683 --> 57:54.867
Maybe when this one is published, then I'll send both of them in together.

57:54.887 --> 57:56.589
Now, you won't forget to get me some articles.

57:56.609 --> 57:57.570
Yeah, right.

57:57.590 --> 57:58.211
Will you do that?

57:59.071 --> 58:03.155
I'd love to get a copy of this and anything else you've done, not necessarily just detective stuff.

58:03.175 --> 58:05.057
Well, I wrote one under a student.

58:05.077 --> 58:05.377
You did?

58:05.758 --> 58:08.080
Yeah, it was kind of a fun one.

58:08.600 --> 58:17.470
And it was about, you know, pornographic books that were written about the Vietnam War.

58:18.332 --> 58:21.075
So, you know, I just gathered a bunch of them together.

58:21.095 --> 58:22.997
And where did you publish that?

58:23.618 --> 58:26.882
I was in another paperback fan magazine.

58:27.723 --> 58:33.890
And are you willing to come out of the closet and claim credit for that now?

58:33.910 --> 58:34.230
Yeah, of course.

58:34.250 --> 58:35.171
What name did you use?

58:35.572 --> 58:36.032
I forget.

58:36.573 --> 58:38.235
Oh, I think it was

58:38.418 --> 58:39.219
Just in case.

58:39.840 --> 58:40.601
Just?

58:40.621 --> 58:41.462
Just in case.

58:41.502 --> 58:43.204
J-U-S-T-A-N.

58:43.224 --> 58:44.466
Just in case.

58:45.247 --> 58:46.289
C-A-R-Y-C-E.

58:46.369 --> 58:50.054
Just in case.

58:50.074 --> 58:50.134
Oh.

58:50.154 --> 58:52.036
You're pretty obviously a pseudonym.

58:52.196 --> 58:53.458
Oh, yeah.

58:53.478 --> 58:54.299
Just in time.

58:54.540 --> 58:56.442
Yeah, that's great.

58:56.462 --> 58:58.305
Okay, I'm going to turn this tape on the other side.

58:58.325 --> 58:59.346
I think we're about to run out.
