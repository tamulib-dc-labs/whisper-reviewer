WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:12.273
Americans are almost very slow to pick up with American readers, not American fiction writers particularly.

00:12.293 --> 00:22.587
Yeah, it's hard to come to the attention of anyone, unless perhaps they're coming over to promote it.

00:22.607 --> 00:26.713
Have you done any publicity tours here before, or is this basically the first time?

00:26.913 --> 00:29.696
Have you visited the States before?

00:29.716 --> 00:31.798
Yeah, I was in the States 30 years ago.

00:31.838 --> 00:34.380
My family emigrated here to L.A.

00:35.020 --> 00:39.104
But it wasn't successful, and we came back after four months.

00:39.144 --> 00:43.368
This is not you, but this is... Yeah, me and... Have you moved to L.A.?

00:43.488 --> 00:45.810
Yeah, for four months, when I was 17.

00:47.672 --> 00:51.155
But my older brother, he stayed... In California?

00:51.816 --> 00:56.160
In California, but within a couple of years he had moved to New York, and then he was...

00:56.427 --> 00:57.669
He was in the army.

00:57.689 --> 00:59.611
He was in the army during the 60s.

01:00.693 --> 01:01.474
The American army?

01:01.554 --> 01:01.794
Yeah.

01:02.455 --> 01:04.258
And since then he's lived in Long Island.

01:04.378 --> 01:04.999
He has four kids.

01:05.660 --> 01:09.205
So I saw him about four days ago for the first time in 14 years.

01:09.225 --> 01:09.345
Wow.

01:10.206 --> 01:12.149
Including a nephew who I'd never seen before.

01:12.529 --> 01:15.133
And he's an extremely skillful soccer player.

01:16.434 --> 01:17.236
So that was really good.

01:17.256 --> 01:18.718
And what's your brother's name?

01:18.738 --> 01:19.118
Ronald.

01:19.318 --> 01:19.599
Ronald.

01:19.699 --> 01:20.360
Ronald, yeah.

01:21.361 --> 01:21.962
Ronald's been good.

01:22.313 --> 01:25.416
Well, so it's kind of a dichotomy, isn't it?

01:25.636 --> 01:46.798
These pieces that I've read in interviews with you, it's kind of a love-hate relationship that you have with the, and I'm putting quotation marks, around the literary establishment on the one hand, but on the other, the recognition that you get from something such as the Booker Prize, it does help introduce you to the readers, doesn't it?

01:46.818 --> 01:48.901
Yeah, definitely.

01:48.921 --> 01:50.262
I would rather do this.

01:50.782 --> 01:59.232
really, because I feel that I don't have any particular relationship in the sense that the Lafayette comes from your side, I think.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.914
I'm just looking at your tobacco here.

02:01.494 --> 02:02.896
Golden, what is it?

02:03.237 --> 02:04.498
Golden, Virginia.

02:04.878 --> 02:06.861
That's an American tobacco?

02:06.921 --> 02:13.388
No, it's British, but inside it's drum, because it's drum that you get here.

02:13.408 --> 02:19.135
But, yeah, they have a lovely relationship with me more than the other way around.

02:20.380 --> 02:32.737
There's a dichotomy in a way that you wouldn't be considering, really, is that, generally speaking, I get very good reviews from the military establishment, and that's what made the odd situation after the Booker.

02:33.218 --> 02:37.985
It's rather as though the Booker was the final show for people watching from the wings.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.591
Well, of course, we'll be pointing out from people who read my stories that

02:43.229 --> 02:45.492
This is a big deal in England.

02:45.512 --> 02:48.536
I mean, this is almost like the Super Bowl, which is coming up this weekend.

02:48.556 --> 02:50.739
Not quite, but... It extends far.

02:50.859 --> 02:56.707
I mean, the reason even why it's been of interest in the States is because it extends far beyond England.

02:57.068 --> 03:00.072
I should also point out, it extends into my country, which is Scotland.

03:01.373 --> 03:05.619
And also, it goes right across the former Commonwealth.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.806
So, it's the top prize, and also for Canadian leaders.

03:10.955 --> 03:13.638
for Australian writers, for writers from Africa.

03:13.758 --> 03:14.078
Oh, really?

03:14.118 --> 03:15.339
Are they eligible for the book?

03:15.359 --> 03:18.802
Yeah, everyone in the, say, the foreign or commonwealth.

03:18.822 --> 03:19.003
Yeah.

03:19.743 --> 03:23.627
Yeah, so it goes right across a real frame.

03:23.647 --> 03:29.793
As opposed to the National Book Award in this country, or the Pulitzer, it requires you to be an American citizen.

03:30.874 --> 03:31.855
Yeah.

03:31.875 --> 03:32.135
Not this.

03:32.475 --> 03:37.620
I mean, London's the centre of publishing for, not only for the UK, you know,

03:37.972 --> 03:41.837
as other people would aspire to be published in London.

03:43.059 --> 03:49.488
So I think the qualifications are that anyone who's published in the UK, perhaps that's it.

03:49.508 --> 04:01.064
But that's why it makes such news across the world, because it's very important in each literary culture or community in these countries.

04:01.084 --> 04:03.507
And also, I don't know why it's taken off,

04:04.448 --> 04:08.173
But, I mean, it's also, the information's relayed across Europe, too.

04:08.354 --> 04:17.547
So, I had, you know, people making contact from places like Italy and Germany and Holland, you know, Finland.

04:17.847 --> 04:18.168
Wow.

04:19.410 --> 04:25.378
Especially, again, in consequence of the speech, the kind of speech that I made after it.

04:25.398 --> 04:25.579
Mm-hmm.

04:25.659 --> 04:28.523
That was a... Well, it was quite an impassioned speech, as I understand it.

04:28.723 --> 04:30.726
It's what... Tell me a little bit about that.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.008
Well...

04:32.140 --> 04:39.970
I mean, our idea is one like soundbite, as we call it, you know, one quote, that nobody's going to take away your culture or your language.

04:39.990 --> 04:44.076
I mean, you have a right to do this, and maybe you could just kind of pick up on that a little bit.

04:44.216 --> 04:44.496
Right.

04:44.557 --> 04:47.460
So, the point I'm trying to establish was not a nationalist point.

04:47.801 --> 04:50.164
It wasn't a... Well, it wasn't a nationalist.

04:50.184 --> 04:51.326
It wasn't, really.

04:51.946 --> 04:56.933
It was a...it was basically the right of any indigenous culture

04:57.048 --> 05:10.067
The right of any indigenous culture, both to exist and for writers and artists within the culture to use the experiences, the language, et cetera, of that culture in which to create art.

05:10.768 --> 05:24.287
So it took pains to establish that it wasn't a nationalist position, although the implication is also a call for the right of self-determination for small countries, but not only countries, also like

05:24.773 --> 05:34.430
you could say ethnic communities within our country, the same argument that there was no hierarchy within cultures or within languages.

05:34.831 --> 05:45.330
I mean the language that I use is not really described as a language at all, it's called a slang or a vernacular or dialect, all of these kind of inferiorisations.

05:45.648 --> 05:48.993
I'm just thinking in terms of the transcription, though.

05:49.053 --> 05:49.313
Yeah.

05:49.553 --> 05:50.154
Okay, go ahead.

05:50.334 --> 06:01.830
You know, they're always relative to the main language, the dominant language, which is English as it is used by authority, really.

06:01.850 --> 06:13.646
So, in a sense, what I'm doing is no different, really, from what people like Faulconer and others within the American alternative tradition have been doing for a hundred years.

06:13.666 --> 06:15.368
You know, regional writing is

06:15.601 --> 06:18.206
is basically the norm here.

06:19.187 --> 06:22.133
In fact, we'll get to talk a little bit about the book.

06:23.455 --> 06:26.220
Are you familiar with William Kennedy at all, who wrote Iron Weed?

06:27.122 --> 06:28.324
I'm not familiar with the novel.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.528
I've heard about him often since I've been here.

06:30.708 --> 06:33.773
Are others making the comparison to him?

06:33.894 --> 06:37.440
Yeah, I'm really keen to look at his work in.

06:37.657 --> 06:53.455
Well, there are a number of parallels, not just in terms of the concept, the artistic structure, but also in terms of the fact that I've done a number of interviews with Bill Kennedy over the years, and everybody in the world rejected that book.

06:53.495 --> 06:58.201
Nobody wanted to buy it, and finally Saul Bellows said, look, this is a wonderful book.

06:58.701 --> 07:06.330
And one of the reasons was the character is that all the publishers would say to him, who's interested in a trunk, who's interested in a bum, you know?

07:06.513 --> 07:13.743
Who wants to read about some guy down and out who's been drinking for 20 years, and he comes home, and he hallucinates for 10 days, or something like that.

07:14.184 --> 07:25.019
And so there are, you know, and also the fact that it's almost Joyce-ian in the way that, you know, you enter this life.

07:25.259 --> 07:28.063
Coming into the perspective.

07:28.143 --> 07:28.904
Exactly.

07:29.005 --> 07:35.794
I read one interview with you where the writer suggested that this is a stream of consciousness,

07:36.162 --> 07:41.092
back to Jesus Christ, because you're reading this, you know, and maybe you could address yourself to that.

07:41.132 --> 07:44.760
I mean, it suggests that you sort of lack out this thing.

07:44.840 --> 07:54.981
Well, it's good that you say that, you know, as a writer, you'll understand that when people say that, well, there are certain things that get said about me that, and I try and say, look,

07:55.484 --> 07:56.865
You're actually talking to a writer.

07:56.885 --> 08:00.989
If what you see applies, you're giving a writer the bravest, and so you could probably give... Really?

08:01.009 --> 08:03.732
I've got my own galleys for my own book in the bag, by the way.

08:03.852 --> 08:09.717
My book is being published in five months, so we need to thank you for recognizing a kindred spirit.

08:09.737 --> 08:13.361
Well, what happened... I'll give you a really good example now.

08:13.381 --> 08:16.103
The last novel I published, A Disaffection... Which was short-listed.

08:16.123 --> 08:16.824
Short-listed.

08:16.904 --> 08:22.369
It also won another sort of a good kind of award, the James Tate Memorial one, which is...

08:22.923 --> 08:27.969
There's only one book is selected and it's not kind of a competition or such.

08:27.989 --> 08:44.068
Now, after the ceremony, one of the guys who was involved with the selection process, it's a university-based award, so an academic, who likes my work, you know, and he took myself and my wife out for a meal.

08:46.250 --> 08:51.917
And he made the comment that really set me back in my heels up there and he said, do you ever revise?

08:52.707 --> 08:55.551
He's probably revised 150 times.

08:55.571 --> 09:00.518
Well, the interesting thing, again, is, you know, because there are so many... Did he revise?

09:00.719 --> 09:01.019
Yeah.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.122
Did he realise he was insulting you?

09:05.686 --> 09:22.090
But you see, that's part of a whole kind of range that fall into a same set, which is, I mean, if you give them the benefit of the doubt, because you're involved in voice also, as opposed to the literary, they somehow...

09:23.015 --> 09:28.782
cannot bring themselves to bring a literary criteria to evaluate its merit.

09:29.803 --> 09:44.820
It's like the field where they have to get involved in orature or something, you know, and again, all those hierarchies in operation, that the orature is a lower art medium than say literature, you know, because it's basically

09:46.977 --> 09:55.728
It's not educated people who are involved in literature, you know, so there's all these different kind of hierarchies that go to kind of, even in physicality, there's an important issue.

09:55.828 --> 09:56.909
Well, that's right there.

09:56.929 --> 10:03.177
And England, and more so even than here, I mean, it's almost structured, it's almost a caste system.

10:03.877 --> 10:08.123
You know, it's like they can't believe Shakespeare wrote the plays because he didn't go to university, you know.

10:08.243 --> 10:12.007
How could anybody be so smart?

10:12.087 --> 10:14.250
Don't worry about it, the cigarettes don't bother me.

10:14.618 --> 10:19.783
Another thing that's common, a lot of black writers experience precisely the same.

10:20.003 --> 10:25.268
People get surprised that you've actually read Joyce, you know, that kind of thing.

10:26.389 --> 10:41.824
So, in a way, one of the nice things about the States, without kind of romanticising it perhaps, and also because I'm meeting people involved in literature, I suppose, is that they can begin from a point above all that stuff, you know.

10:42.648 --> 10:57.677
And another thing, speaking with a journalist yesterday, who was unable to comprehend what all the hostility and controversy was about... No, I comprehend it very well.

10:57.697 --> 11:05.432
Well, you'll have more knowledge of the workings of the elitism than he has,

11:05.750 --> 11:10.440
Again, in a sense, it's because it is actually a prejudice, and it's not irrational for him.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.104
It's not based in reason, you know?

11:12.124 --> 11:12.986
It's got a lot of things.

11:13.266 --> 11:15.792
It's anger that you probably write so well.

11:16.333 --> 11:22.847
It's having to acknowledge that it's good, that it's beating out more conventional stuff in the whole country.

11:23.097 --> 11:32.510
the fact that you probably don't have a university degree and you're not part of the establishment, and that you maybe even in your own way show a little bit of contempt for them every once in a while.

11:32.711 --> 11:33.011
Yeah.

11:35.455 --> 11:42.605
Yeah, there's a friend of mine, a black friend of mine, who said, Jim, your trouble is your uppity.

11:42.625 --> 11:49.054
And again, it has to do with not being grateful, you know,

11:50.063 --> 11:55.109
It's not enough that they allow you to be published in London, for instance.

11:55.629 --> 12:00.355
Or even the award you the prize, that I didn't wear a bow tie in that evening.

12:00.996 --> 12:03.338
And even that was regarded as kind of a major statement.

12:03.699 --> 12:07.183
Well, I understand that they were suggesting that you should have a tuxedo.

12:07.323 --> 12:07.763
Yeah.

12:07.884 --> 12:09.806
And you said, well, who's buying this for me?

12:09.826 --> 12:10.687
I can't afford it.

12:10.847 --> 12:15.753
Well, I mean, I've been on prize shortlist basically since I started writing.

12:15.833 --> 12:18.636
Or rather, since about eight, my first novel.

12:18.937 --> 12:20.540
which is at 83 or 84.

12:21.481 --> 12:35.664
And I've always tried to make the point on, you know, on behalf of writers in general, you know, that all these publicity deals to do with awards and prizes, and they expect you to travel two or three hundred miles, give over three days out of your working life.

12:35.904 --> 12:37.908
You have to pay most expenses yourself.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.692
You have to buy the proper clothes or hire them.

12:41.245 --> 12:43.528
All of these things are done out of your own pocket.

12:43.548 --> 12:45.590
I mean, most writers have got no money, you know.

12:45.730 --> 12:46.731
Tell me that.

12:46.751 --> 12:49.354
You know, so, I mean... I'm a freelancer, by the way.

12:49.374 --> 12:51.056
I'm not employed by a newspaper.

12:51.076 --> 12:57.183
Well, you know, when you're involved with people who are on regular incomes, you can never comprehend the basic economics, you know.

12:57.203 --> 13:03.490
That would be a kind of really heavy irony, such as, how do I get to London from the long ago?

13:03.740 --> 13:04.641
and who's going to pay.

13:04.801 --> 13:09.067
Yeah, I'll shut this off just for a second, because we don't need this.

13:09.328 --> 13:11.310
Okay, we'll be back on here.

13:13.854 --> 13:16.597
Who is your ideal reader?

13:16.677 --> 13:18.320
Who are you writing these for?

13:18.340 --> 13:19.922
Are you writing for people in Scotland?

13:19.942 --> 13:21.164
Are you writing for people in England?

13:21.184 --> 13:24.168
Are you writing for everybody who reads in the English language?

13:24.368 --> 13:25.690
Tell me a little bit about who you're writing.

13:25.850 --> 13:30.817
Well, the way I operate as a writer is not to bother about the reader at all, really.

13:30.837 --> 13:32.599
It's just to...

13:32.984 --> 13:35.868
The end lies in the actual story itself.

13:37.130 --> 13:52.213
I feel that you have to forget these notions and work out what you're in control of as a writer or what you should be in control of and not kind of get bogged down in what should be a publicity officer's job or something like that.

13:52.794 --> 13:57.321
I think our job is to write the story properly or just to finish the story properly.

13:58.246 --> 14:00.008
and after that it's on its own, really.

14:00.629 --> 14:08.098
You know, you can maybe sell the thing after all, put it into a certain magazine or whatever, but you should never write intentionally for the magazine.

14:08.118 --> 14:20.993
I think it's the healthiest thing to do for writers is to do the stories, and once you've done the stories, then see where you should replace it, for example, if it's individual stories, but not the other way around.

14:21.013 --> 14:27.561
The thing the other way around just needs to compromise is ultimately... But you really, your reader has to...

14:28.216 --> 14:29.097
go halfway.

14:29.197 --> 14:37.506
I mean, you're not presenting something that is easily penetrated, shall we say, or absorbed or entered.

14:37.526 --> 14:41.671
I mean, it does require the attention of the reader, doesn't it?

14:41.691 --> 14:43.533
You mean your compromise is what you say?

14:43.633 --> 14:51.902
Well, I try not to, but I'm not sure how far that's true, but, you know, it's just a case of being as precise as you can.

14:52.002 --> 14:58.189
I think the precision really is about, is it really, you know, and

14:58.625 --> 14:59.947
as precise as possible.

15:00.708 --> 15:13.824
Working the way I am, using language for two purposes, or using rather punctuation for two purposes, say for the grammatical but also for phrasing, almost like a score, directions for a speaking voice.

15:13.984 --> 15:16.728
So there's two ways it's operating.

15:16.928 --> 15:24.738
So to that extent you're kind of in the same situation as maybe a poet, a really good poet might be, you know, using vowel sounds.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.459
If you look at some

15:25.962 --> 15:37.580
just say the red field, but one of these kind of poems, and you realise that I work out that every single bill sounds different, and every bill sounds different, you know, right across.

15:38.001 --> 15:48.257
That kind of precision, so that the reader will never, and this is after the effect, but one of the results or effects of it is

15:49.148 --> 15:53.234
that you're stopping the reader from losing concentration by repetition.

15:53.535 --> 15:57.300
You know, again, another basic part of the writer's craft, repetition.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.844
I get condemned for all these F-words, you know.

16:00.024 --> 16:04.972
Again, one of the gravest insults you could give, that repetition is part of.

16:05.172 --> 16:12.643
Obviously, if we use repetition, there has to be a reason for, there has to be an emphasis of some description.

16:13.284 --> 16:14.867
How do you respond to this criticism?

16:15.007 --> 16:18.312
One of the judges, out of the Book of Price, really, I guess, was a little upset.

16:18.882 --> 16:31.858
Yeah, I mean, you know, even going back to your previous question and taking that question, part of it's the same thing.

16:31.878 --> 16:41.070
As a writer, you hope that your work will be seen in a context that will make it less difficult if you're using an English language in a different way from the norm.

16:41.951 --> 16:48.079
You kind of assume, I think that's the best way of saying it, you assume that the educated critic

16:48.464 --> 16:57.953
has had some experience of the other English language traditions that are relative to the norm, or rather a negating standard English literary form.

16:58.794 --> 17:02.758
I mean, we don't have to stay in the States or in Ireland in Scotland to see it.

17:02.778 --> 17:15.990
We see it happening in all the countries that would be under the Commonwealth Booker Prize thing, you know, in other words, whatever English has been the language of imperial authority and imposition on indigenous culture,

17:16.662 --> 17:22.367
we'll find at this moment in time that this is where writers are moving again.

17:22.807 --> 17:23.748
They're using English.

17:24.449 --> 17:26.030
Okay, a lot of them have to use English.

17:26.411 --> 17:32.216
Some have actually rejected English, like Medugi Wationgo, the Kenyan writer, who has been back to writing in Kukuyu.

17:33.317 --> 17:39.883
And we find in Nigeria, writers like Amos Tutuola using English in really exciting ways.

17:39.943 --> 17:44.627
The rhythms of the languages of his own culture, again, Yoruba, Hauser,

17:45.248 --> 17:47.771
So the phrasing and the syntax is used differently.

17:47.791 --> 18:00.624
We find it also in the Afro... One of the things that I can find odd, I must say, odd, is the lack of awareness of the white people in the States to what's going on with the Afro-American writers.

18:01.325 --> 18:15.019
And even the good academics who are doing really useful work in the kind of things I'm saying, like June Jordan, obviously, is one, you know.

18:15.353 --> 18:25.348
Writers, Bell Hooks is another, you know, who have been very analytic and the best sort of academic, and who are also either poets or writers of fiction.

18:25.368 --> 18:29.274
So these kind of things we're talking about, that's part of the problem.

18:29.294 --> 18:36.444
You sort of assume that there is a context, that this literary context, a tradition, will be known to literary critics, you know.

18:37.626 --> 18:41.451
And also down the line, in fact, it works the other way.

18:41.572 --> 18:43.875
When I'm giving the readings, the last three readings I've given,

18:44.547 --> 18:56.297
in DC, New York, in Boston, the level of sophistication amongst the people who have been in the audience has been what I would have hoped would have come from the critics.

18:56.658 --> 18:57.558
So they are familiar.

18:57.598 --> 19:14.453
Okay, they won't always know, but as soon as I kind of point out, just a point out to the parallels between writers, you know, you can actually see it almost in their faces, you know, just the, of course, of course, of course, you know.

19:14.804 --> 19:36.569
So, I mean, to go back to the Booker, the judge who made these points, I would have assumed, obviously, and especially because the women's Jewish priesthood, she's a rabbi, I mean, part of what I'm talking about was central to the Jewish tradition and literature.

19:36.729 --> 19:41.014
Isaac Singer, he always wrote in Yiddish.

19:41.281 --> 19:57.064
I knew precise, and again, this was an intentional and political position, because that is central, like, in 1840, 1850, at the Mendele Seforum, the bookseller, who was a great... Oh, well, he's one of... I'm going to give us the other guy, you know.

19:57.084 --> 19:59.087
My book is about bibliomania, by the way.

19:59.167 --> 20:08.841
Well, he's one of... I mean, even with Jewish friends, you know, like, one guy was...

20:09.918 --> 20:27.682
But again, as a writer, of course, you move into all the different traditions, but what's especially important, of course, is his insistence in using Yiddish and to get into the experience of the people, you know.

20:28.403 --> 20:30.205
He gave his Nobel lecture in Yiddish.

20:30.758 --> 20:32.801
I didn't even know he won the Nobel Prize.

20:32.821 --> 20:34.444
Oh, you're talking about Singer.

20:34.464 --> 20:37.108
Sorry, I was talking about his set-form.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.491
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:39.611 --> 20:41.454
I thought we came back there.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.838
Yeah, no, but it's the same.

20:43.918 --> 20:45.961
So, I mean, Singer is working in that tradition.

20:46.081 --> 20:46.342
Right.

20:46.662 --> 20:59.702
And the other two major figures, too, I like him, but a much stronger writer, the stronger writer, I think it was his name, who was working around about 1900,

21:00.205 --> 21:02.008
I know who you mean, yeah.

21:02.028 --> 21:02.528
But anyway.

21:03.029 --> 21:03.890
Pettis.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.671
Isaac Pettis.

21:04.772 --> 21:05.853
Oh, okay.

21:06.194 --> 21:06.294
Good.

21:06.314 --> 21:06.935
Yeah.

21:06.955 --> 21:16.869
Tell me the importance of writing a literature as an expression of your culture.

21:17.951 --> 21:19.553
How important it is.

21:19.573 --> 21:23.178
I mean, you are a Scotsman, and that's important.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.562
Yeah.

21:25.582 --> 21:26.483
I mean, could you write

21:26.800 --> 21:28.683
in conventional English prose?

21:29.444 --> 21:49.231
You would find, I think, like, you know, the short stories, and there is a range, you know, again, there's a range of formal themes, not themes, but there's a range of voice and a range of experience that open the stories.

21:49.431 --> 21:55.660
So, I mean, yeah, there are very, especially when I was maybe younger, in my late 20s, early 30s, I did a lot of,

21:56.433 --> 22:00.498
experimentation and exercise work in stories.

22:00.538 --> 22:06.604
And the stories work, you know, about using, uh, that's the kind of things you do, doing pastiches and various things.

22:07.185 --> 22:08.707
So yeah, I mean, yeah.

22:08.727 --> 22:12.110
Do you see your work as a corpus, as a... Yeah.

22:12.130 --> 22:15.654
...everything as part of a scheme?

22:15.674 --> 22:17.516
Yeah, yeah, definitely as a corpus.

22:17.576 --> 22:24.364
And that, again, was one of the things about the Book of Price hostility, again, because

22:24.580 --> 22:38.214
I was treated as though, basically, I had appeared from nowhere by one section of the media, and of course, in the other section, and also these, they knew carefully, of course, there was a corpus of work.

22:38.234 --> 22:46.583
I've published many more than a hundred short stories, and I've published five plays, essays, four novels, you know.

22:46.603 --> 22:46.863
Wow.

22:47.164 --> 22:54.351
But again, the thing is that there is, of course, a political subtext to others.

22:54.955 --> 22:58.219
a discourse that could have taken place and didn't take place.

22:59.281 --> 23:10.415
It was good to have raised questions of the right to self-determination and have these kind of broadcasts from the heart of Imperial England, really.

23:11.336 --> 23:23.933
But there are other issues that could have been raised too, such as things that the central characters involved in, you know, such as

23:24.098 --> 23:29.868
Is this fantasy that someone who's blind cannot have his blindness diagnosed by a doctor?

23:31.891 --> 23:33.193
These are some questions.

23:33.213 --> 23:36.499
If you don't mind jumping to the metaphor of blindness.

23:37.581 --> 23:40.165
I guess where Sammy comes from.

23:41.728 --> 23:47.878
Was it a challenge for you to put yourself into the shoes of a man who all of a sudden can't see you?

23:49.512 --> 24:01.243
Absolutely, because of course the way I operate is not to begin with an idea, you know, so I just begin with start from the woods, you know, and make the story, you know.

24:01.263 --> 24:03.446
I make the story up, that's what storytelling is.

24:03.946 --> 24:06.368
I make the story.

24:06.609 --> 24:17.359
Using the old thing, you know, the maker, so I had no idea the character was going to become blind at all until he, you know, so his grappling

24:17.795 --> 24:22.400
the way he was created, almost by chance.

24:22.440 --> 24:22.761
Yeah.

24:23.762 --> 24:37.998
I guess you saw this confrontation and they beat him up and... I didn't, no, it was just like, so, at the point in the story where he's going, I don't seem able to see it, whatever happens, well, that was like, that was me straight also.

24:38.559 --> 24:40.301
I had no conception of it.

24:40.361 --> 24:44.005
You know, it was basically having to stop occasionally and go, what,

24:44.778 --> 24:46.019
Good God, you know.

24:46.039 --> 24:48.101
The story all of a sudden went from here to there.

24:48.181 --> 24:48.822
Yeah.

24:48.842 --> 24:49.142
It changed.

24:49.162 --> 24:56.390
Well, I'd begun from nowhere anyway, because I'd only begun from playing about with words and carrying through one line, you know, which is how it operates.

24:56.410 --> 25:06.339
It just began in me being depressed and probably hungover and feeling that, you know, I have to go to work today, you know, and sitting down.

25:06.400 --> 25:11.825
The way I began was just to almost like take cognizance of my immediate surroundings, you know.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.907
If a kid bangs in the door, then

25:14.393 --> 25:20.800
that's the opening sentence, or I can't work because I've got a hangover, that becomes the opening sentence for me.

25:20.820 --> 25:24.184
I always try to, there's no such thing as a blank page, you know?

25:24.204 --> 25:25.606
There's no such thing as a blank page?

25:25.666 --> 25:30.871
No, I feel, you know, I do a lot of tutoring, or I have done over the years, and that's about the first thing.

25:30.892 --> 25:32.333
How are you writing these days?

25:32.353 --> 25:34.215
By, by, by... Remote control?

25:34.235 --> 25:37.259
Yeah, well... Do you use a word processor?

25:37.279 --> 25:41.143
Oh yeah, I use J-word processor.

25:41.815 --> 25:56.591
So at once at the point when it has become blind, it's just like you have to go with the invention and be patient, pay attention to detail, work in the concrete, work in the immediate, and don't jump ahead.

25:57.091 --> 25:58.673
No shortcuts.

25:59.033 --> 26:02.657
How long did it take you to write this book?

26:02.677 --> 26:04.439
The two main bursts.

26:04.479 --> 26:10.185
The first burst was about six months, and then I was off for about a year and a half.

26:10.975 --> 26:13.659
and then they brought it to conclusion another six months.

26:13.859 --> 26:17.644
So it was in two, which is fairly short for me, or rather fairly quick.

26:18.305 --> 26:21.229
The novels are usually longer than that.

26:21.249 --> 26:22.771
Um, you're how old now?

26:22.791 --> 26:23.693
Forty-eight.

26:23.713 --> 26:24.314
Forty-eight.

26:24.334 --> 26:24.794
Yeah.

26:25.015 --> 26:30.062
And I gather that you don't have much formal schooling, is that correct?

26:30.082 --> 26:38.333
Well, what happened was I left school at fifteen, but I actually went to university

26:40.085 --> 26:40.866
When I was 20.

26:40.886 --> 26:42.348
20, 29.

26:42.628 --> 26:43.969
In Glasgow.

26:43.989 --> 26:45.231
Yeah.

26:45.251 --> 26:46.953
I was already published by then.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.476
I'd been published for about four or five years before.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.219
Where did this come from?

26:53.040 --> 26:54.882
Where did the writing come from?

26:55.222 --> 26:58.666
What did you do when you started out of school at 15?

26:58.686 --> 26:59.086
I didn't do it.

26:59.927 --> 27:00.708
Did you work?

27:00.768 --> 27:01.028
Yeah.

27:01.289 --> 27:02.891
Well, yeah, I started work at 15.

27:03.391 --> 27:05.974
I started work as a compositor in the printing trade.

27:06.629 --> 27:08.231
and stuck there for about two years.

27:08.331 --> 27:10.713
After I came back from the States, I couldn't get back in.

27:10.733 --> 27:13.456
The union would not allow me back in.

27:14.197 --> 27:21.304
So then I began the sort of range of jobs that most writers want to put on their page, you know.

27:22.345 --> 27:30.172
So I worked in the construction industry as a labourer, and I worked in factories and driving buses, a number of things, you know.

27:30.393 --> 27:32.755
But I gradually forced myself out of employment.

27:33.865 --> 27:37.308
because my real work was writing.

27:38.229 --> 27:44.935
At what point did this dawn on you, that you had this gift?

27:45.556 --> 27:47.958
Well, I wanted to work on it.

27:48.038 --> 27:51.321
About twenty-one started writing.

27:52.222 --> 27:55.045
Very early twenty-two, I started to write.

27:55.245 --> 27:56.406
And it was fictional, right?

27:56.426 --> 27:57.487
Yeah, yeah.

27:57.887 --> 28:00.690
At the same time I got married, about twenty-two.

28:01.090 --> 28:03.012
I met my wife around the same time,

28:03.683 --> 28:05.445
I was settling down, you know.

28:05.465 --> 28:06.907
Married to the same woman?

28:06.927 --> 28:08.249
Yes, yeah.

28:08.449 --> 28:10.112
All these years, 28 years now?

28:10.172 --> 28:11.534
Well, no, 25 years.

28:11.814 --> 28:13.216
How many?

28:14.598 --> 28:16.360
Two daughters who are 24 and 25.

28:16.500 --> 28:22.348
I've got two daughters, 13 and 12, so I know they're close together.

28:23.890 --> 28:29.678
Yeah, so, well, we were with me at the Booker Prize, my daughters and my wife.

28:29.698 --> 28:31.260
That was one reason why I went, I think.

28:31.645 --> 28:33.387
Very strong support, you know.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.069
Have you had to work through all the years?

28:35.089 --> 28:39.174
I mean, you've got a very impressive list of publishing credits.

28:39.674 --> 28:42.478
Have you had to work through a day job?

28:42.558 --> 28:43.259
No.

28:43.279 --> 28:57.315
My wife and I really began from a partnership, and she kind of was very pragmatic about the whole thing, and knew that she had to be the breadwinner.

28:58.308 --> 28:59.749
You know, the real breadwinner.

28:59.809 --> 29:02.191
And she has accepted this office?

29:02.291 --> 29:18.225
Yeah, so Marie started off in a part-time job, and did night school, and then did day school, and then got to university, and then did a social work course, and has been a social worker for the last 10 years.

29:18.325 --> 29:19.566
And she also went to Glasgow?

29:20.247 --> 29:20.967
At the University of Glasgow?

29:20.987 --> 29:22.749
Yeah, but she's not from Glasgow.

29:22.909 --> 29:26.252
She's originally from Wales, and we met in London.

29:26.272 --> 29:26.812
But she's Welsh?

29:27.313 --> 29:27.893
She's Welsh.

29:28.177 --> 29:30.840
And we met in London, but our people are Canadian.

29:31.400 --> 29:31.701
Wow.

29:32.141 --> 29:32.762
And what's her name?

29:33.442 --> 29:34.744
Her name is Marie.

29:34.864 --> 29:36.466
Marie, yeah.

29:36.486 --> 29:37.767
And the daughters' names are?

29:38.247 --> 29:38.988
Laura and Emma.

29:39.949 --> 29:40.690
Laura and Emma.

29:40.710 --> 29:40.950
Yeah.

29:41.651 --> 29:46.376
So, really, she's been the breadwinner right the way through.

29:46.476 --> 29:50.320
Like most writers or artists, I just, I provide the luxuries.

29:51.861 --> 29:52.962
My wife's a social worker.

29:52.982 --> 29:55.165
She's the supreme.

29:55.185 --> 29:56.126
It's wonderful, isn't it?

29:56.146 --> 29:57.407
Well, one of the things that,

29:58.130 --> 30:07.245
And she's never even, like, she has never had that absolute trust that would allow her to say, oh well, we can rely on him.

30:07.706 --> 30:09.048
She's never been able to do that.

30:09.969 --> 30:19.245
And since the booker, the thing that's allowed hourly, or been good for our relationship really, is that it's allowed her to go part-time for nine months.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.450
She's gone part-time until September.

30:22.700 --> 30:24.502
You know, but she won't go beyond September.

30:24.582 --> 30:26.865
So you're actually carrying a little bit of the load here.

30:27.866 --> 30:29.628
Yeah, for nine months though.

30:29.648 --> 30:32.472
I don't think she trusts it enough to go beyond nine months.

30:32.492 --> 30:37.658
Well, you must have a pretty good advance on the next book by now, I hope.

30:37.918 --> 30:39.340
No, not anyway.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.301
But you have one.

30:40.321 --> 30:41.382
Yeah, I've got one, yeah.

30:41.402 --> 30:43.565
Is it a work in progress or is it done?

30:43.585 --> 30:47.570
Yeah, the publisher assumes it is.

30:47.890 --> 30:48.831
You say what?

30:48.851 --> 30:52.015
The publisher assumes it's a work in progress.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.603
What are you hoping to deliver it?

30:57.127 --> 31:03.355
Well, I should have about two years to deliver, so I've got really plenty of time.

31:03.376 --> 31:08.443
But I wouldn't start back work until April, once all the stuff's by, you know.

31:08.463 --> 31:20.820
Um, talk to me about this, one of the press releases that I've seen identifies you as, as at the vanguard of this, and these are their quotes, this two-wave of,

31:21.239 --> 31:24.503
of the Scottish literary tradition.

31:24.523 --> 31:24.803
Yeah.

31:25.004 --> 31:30.410
Except that... There are... No, in a way, no.

31:30.530 --> 31:41.684
It's fine from the outside, but in Scotland, over the last 20, 25 years, there's been... Right now, there are quite a few good writers around.

31:43.786 --> 31:50.875
Good young writers and good old writers working from similar sets of premises.

31:51.530 --> 32:11.979
but not formally akin, you know, and also writers who are not really known outside of Scotland, but who have also been very influential, not known mainly because they're poets and operating in language that is Scottish in whatever way.

32:12.139 --> 32:18.027
Of course Scotland has quite a wide diverse culture, you know, there's been a lot of immigration to Scotland,

32:19.087 --> 32:23.932
And also, of course, there are the old, the Gaelic, which is still current and in use.

32:25.253 --> 32:31.460
So, obviously, writers working in Gaelic have a very hard time, and also have remained unknown.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.743
The best Scottish writers are totally unknown, basically.

32:34.763 --> 32:43.412
There's an old man of Haiti, Sorley Maclean, who's a Gaelic speaker and uses and writes in Gaelic in the same way the singer did, and for the same reasons.

32:43.832 --> 32:44.733
He's a major poet.

32:45.354 --> 32:46.815
He's genuinely a major poet.

32:47.504 --> 32:59.362
But he'll be known in places like Castilla, or Brittany, in some parts of Europe, some parts of Canada, in some parts of the States.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.928
But generally speaking, he's not known at all.

33:02.948 --> 33:07.134
He's also a tradition bearer, in the way that a singer would want to be.

33:08.837 --> 33:12.382
Talk a little bit about Sammy as a character.

33:13.304 --> 33:15.587
He's likable, certainly.

33:16.462 --> 33:22.449
He's a sympathetic character, but he certainly has his flaws, doesn't he?

33:22.469 --> 33:23.430
Yes.

33:25.352 --> 33:30.998
The difficulty again in the writing was not to fall off the line and make it become sentimental.

33:31.559 --> 33:38.247
I think the bottom line is that he's used to surviving around the lowest ebb possible.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.009
Around the lowest grip?

33:40.029 --> 33:43.853
About the lowest ebb or level.

33:44.339 --> 33:51.688
At that level, I think light blindness just becomes really like another problem to be encountered.

33:52.870 --> 34:02.121
New strategies are to be developed, but you continue to exist, you know, a fear that are not existing.

34:02.142 --> 34:08.530
Is blindness a metaphor for existence for you?

34:08.550 --> 34:12.034
Personally, outside of the novel, I don't know,

34:13.010 --> 34:15.132
Many people prefer to be myopic.

34:17.876 --> 34:26.125
I kind of go along with a great deal of Tromsky's thesis on the myopia of the citizens of our country.

34:26.806 --> 34:35.176
I think that is also part of the reason for the reaction of the hostility, is that people prefer not to see what's under their noses.

34:35.977 --> 34:40.502
They prefer to believe that the people who are hanging around, begging in the street,

34:40.972 --> 34:43.114
are not really 100% people.

34:44.035 --> 35:00.331
They're not really thinking beings, but they're just kind of a... not machines, but things that only kind of act in a behaviourist way, that they don't really have any... Do you see yourself as a spokesman for any certain class or group of people?

35:00.351 --> 35:00.571
No.

35:01.072 --> 35:05.376
I'm against kind of a representative politics altogether, you know.

35:05.536 --> 35:08.599
I do believe in empowerment, you know,

35:10.418 --> 35:19.229
genuine democracy, as opposed to what we get in the West, which is just a charade, you know, whether in your country or my country, it's just a con.

35:19.249 --> 35:23.615
No, I believe in a genuine democracy, i.e.

35:23.635 --> 35:26.919
not representation, the way it's degenerated into.

35:26.979 --> 35:31.505
In the purest sense, then, you see this as a depiction.

35:31.545 --> 35:31.885
Yeah.

35:31.905 --> 35:32.746
As a story telling?

35:32.766 --> 35:36.431
I mean, tell me about the necessity of narrative.

35:37.452 --> 35:38.433
Definitely.

35:38.574 --> 35:38.974
I think

35:39.410 --> 35:47.900
I have strong political opinions and beliefs myself, but it really is, it would be intrusion, and it would be self-indulgent that that would enter into my work.

35:47.960 --> 35:55.909
I mean, that would tie in with the idea of writing for a readership, or writing for an editor, or writing for the market.

35:56.130 --> 35:59.814
That really is intrusion, and it would always act against the story.

35:59.834 --> 36:02.958
I really do regard myself all I've ever wanted to do.

36:02.998 --> 36:06.241
Like the Carlos Williams thing, I wanted to write a poem.

36:06.802 --> 36:07.543
That's basically it.

36:08.114 --> 36:25.036
I just want to write stories, you know, and from an early age, and that's the way it is now, and it's just getting deeper and deeper into it and expanding it out the way, you know, going deeply into it to kind of come out the way.

36:25.056 --> 36:29.002
Are you a strong believer when that story emerges from character?

36:29.703 --> 36:33.868
Are your novels, stories, character driven or fraud driven?

36:34.642 --> 36:36.103
They're certainly not plot driven.

36:36.123 --> 36:38.546
They can't be because of the methodology I use.

36:39.667 --> 36:46.574
They begin from character and being faced by the outside world.

36:47.855 --> 36:53.240
So if I want to begin a new story, there are different devices I use.

36:53.361 --> 36:57.685
One of the most important ones is to take a character for a walk.

36:59.126 --> 37:02.910
Just take the character for a walk and stay in the immediate past.

37:03.835 --> 37:06.519
In other words, don't be bothered using the present tense.

37:08.281 --> 37:10.444
I say to him, you know that kind of crap.

37:10.464 --> 37:20.819
All you have to do is think of the act of saying what is happening sets a thing in the past, that immediate past.

37:23.403 --> 37:26.006
And then your character, you're open for anything.

37:26.487 --> 37:29.932
The kind of brute reality of what's going on in the world will hit you.

37:31.594 --> 37:33.437
You'll act upon it and be acted upon.

37:33.772 --> 37:47.629
So the character in that situation is what drives the story, and also gives it its drama and its mystery, because it's not plotted.

37:47.649 --> 37:49.071
You don't know anybody like Cary.

37:49.131 --> 37:50.393
Cary's a total invention.

37:50.553 --> 37:52.355
Yeah, total invention.

37:52.375 --> 38:00.285
It was more difficult for, you see again, if you know more of work, being able to handle a character that's blind,

38:00.451 --> 38:27.117
as a kind of extension of how I've been operating in the narrative for ten years, which I began from a point, or rather not, well in the novels I began from a point of trying to write a kind of value-free prose, in the same way that Gertrude Stein was after Rob Greer, some of the French writers, trying to find a way of not having value, you know,

38:27.603 --> 38:33.268
trying to strip things right down, almost as the presentation of a fact, in a way that Kafka does.

38:33.789 --> 38:34.810
Kafka also does that.

38:36.351 --> 38:38.333
It seems to me that you do a tremendous amount of reading.

38:38.974 --> 38:56.530
Well, I have done, I don't seem to do it these days, but again, reading as a writer reading, in a way, so the things that you pick up further intuitively, or occasionally just seeing something that a writer does, so maybe a close reading is more

38:57.218 --> 39:02.383
Are you mindfully influenced by other writers, or do you think it's more... No, I'm not.

39:02.403 --> 39:04.305
...a closest kind of a thing?

39:04.325 --> 39:09.591
Yeah, I think what happens is, retrospectively, and it can be different periods.

39:09.691 --> 39:15.717
If you look back and see a story you wrote maybe 10, 15 years ago, and you think, Christ, I must have been reading Dostoevsky then, you know?

39:15.737 --> 39:19.060
Or, I must have been reading, you know?

39:19.140 --> 39:21.623
So, especially, I think, when you're younger,

39:22.227 --> 39:25.632
You know, because you find these exciting new ways of doing things.

39:25.752 --> 39:30.679
As a craftsman, basically, you become, God, you know, I could do this.

39:31.540 --> 39:43.717
You find a way, even basic things like how to move on a day later without saying, all that day he was in a huff.

39:43.957 --> 39:47.242
You might say you published a huff, about a hundred stories or so.

39:47.282 --> 39:48.143
More than that, yeah.

39:48.964 --> 39:49.665
How many novels?

39:49.866 --> 39:51.508
Four, this is a four.

39:52.231 --> 39:59.603
Do you like to do a story, do a couple stories, do a novel, or do you basically like writing that?

39:59.803 --> 40:08.777
I like to have a lot of work in process, and a lot of it will never be around after I'm dead, you know.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.059
But I don't throw anything away.

40:10.941 --> 40:19.875
And even occasionally a story may develop differently from the first couple of pages, and you may get rid of the first couple of pages, but I would keep that.

40:20.243 --> 40:31.576
and use it again, you know, because occasionally you can make stories, more stories like, you know, Chekhov or Flannery O'Connor is another one who you'll see, like... I love Flannery O'Connor.

40:31.596 --> 40:43.230
Yeah, but you know, there are a couple of stories of Flannery O'Connor where you'll see where the same kind of motivation or impulse that didn't quite develop in that way has given rise to another story.

40:44.872 --> 40:47.635
I did interview with Megan Gordomar a couple of months ago.

40:48.037 --> 40:55.907
And she says, it's amazing that she finds, to look at, I asked her the same question, does she see it as a corpus and as a body of work?

40:55.947 --> 40:57.028
She says, oh, absolutely.

40:57.049 --> 41:00.473
She says, in fact, it's almost the same thing written over and over again.

41:00.913 --> 41:02.235
It's like walking around.

41:02.636 --> 41:06.581
You think you've done everything from this side, but then you walk around and see it from that side.

41:06.961 --> 41:10.225
And maybe it is an exploration of the same thing.

41:10.366 --> 41:11.827
Yeah, yeah.

41:12.088 --> 41:12.949
The body of work.

41:13.530 --> 41:13.870
Yeah.

41:14.491 --> 41:17.014
It was an interesting conversation like that.

41:17.669 --> 41:22.434
Yeah, well, again, the corpus, again, it's what you assume as a writer.

41:22.935 --> 41:29.903
I mean, it's so kind of, it's not foolish, but it's impractical.

41:30.163 --> 41:41.235
It's to assume that everyone who interviews, every critic or every reader, is intimately aware of the corpus, you know, which, of course, is not the case.

41:41.756 --> 41:45.280
But if that were true, the idea of the... I would hope that's true, at some point.

41:45.648 --> 41:49.092
Do you have a sense of where you'd like to see this all go?

41:49.112 --> 41:51.635
I mean... No.

41:51.935 --> 41:57.421
As a writer, again, you... You certainly have a sense of your life, though.

41:57.441 --> 41:58.583
Yeah, yeah.

41:58.743 --> 42:01.066
It's not an idle pursuit, I mean... Yeah.

42:01.766 --> 42:02.787
No, no.

42:02.868 --> 42:09.135
I mean, there was a politics to it many years ago, even in trying to subvert narrative for them.

42:10.036 --> 42:11.217
I was kind of aware of

42:12.293 --> 42:16.378
being angry because I was not being allowed as a young writer to do certain things.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.402
So I was very much aware of that.

42:20.864 --> 42:27.573
You know, I was writing in kind of phonetic transcription when I was 25, and I stopped doing it for about 15 years.

42:27.794 --> 42:29.977
I've gradually more and more returned to it.

42:33.081 --> 42:34.903
Well, I'll tell you, I think we've got a lot of stuff here.

42:35.364 --> 42:38.949
We've come out of ground pretty quickly.

42:38.969 --> 42:41.592
Anything else that you feel that I've...

42:41.842 --> 42:43.864
I'm not sure.

42:48.510 --> 42:50.472
I've got a lot of material for it.

42:52.254 --> 42:52.755
Yeah?

42:52.775 --> 42:56.739
Let's do this again.

42:56.779 --> 43:00.844
You're talking about a fellow named Roland Comstock from Missouri?

43:01.084 --> 43:04.648
Yeah, well, yeah, Romans are loyal, you know.

43:04.668 --> 43:07.832
Do you know where in Missouri, what town?

43:09.027 --> 43:09.327
St.

43:09.347 --> 43:10.990
Louis, Kansas City?

43:11.150 --> 43:13.153
No, and it's not.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.134
How do you know about that?

43:14.314 --> 43:23.867
Well, he collects certain contemporary writers, and has been for a while, you know, so I'm one of the writers that he collects.

43:23.887 --> 43:26.451
So you've known him for some time, so there's been a power in abundance?

43:27.012 --> 43:30.316
Four years since he, yeah.

43:30.897 --> 43:33.921
So, you know, well, this will include

43:34.373 --> 43:40.181
rare magazines and where I produced maybe an essay or a short story.

43:41.663 --> 43:47.772
There was also a guy last night here in Boston who also is a collector.

43:48.213 --> 43:53.260
These people I'm basically writing about very to the ultimate degree with, but why does Comstock impress you?

43:53.510 --> 43:55.133
he would fly to see you?

43:55.393 --> 43:59.059
Well, yeah, it wouldn't obviously just be me.

43:59.079 --> 44:03.626
I know that he collected Burgess and, you know, Alastair Graves.

44:03.686 --> 44:06.170
He also collects Salman Rushdie.

44:06.190 --> 44:09.174
So he likes... It's contemporary.

44:09.194 --> 44:10.757
But not necessarily American writers.

44:10.837 --> 44:11.558
No, not at all.

44:11.718 --> 44:14.382
Not American writers, as you just mentioned.

44:14.402 --> 44:17.367
Yeah, well, I'm sure he collects American writers, too.

44:18.469 --> 44:20.732
Does he impress you as being obsessed?

44:21.303 --> 44:23.086
No, he doesn't at all.

44:23.106 --> 44:28.314
I mean, I don't think any lawyer would impress as being obsessed, really.

44:28.354 --> 44:39.852
He doesn't know, but he, as a self, kind of a, well, describing himself as a completist, indicates that he is a good ironic.

44:39.892 --> 44:40.453
Yeah.

44:40.493 --> 44:41.455
Meaning he wants everything.

44:41.475 --> 44:41.775
Yeah.

44:42.777 --> 44:49.167
But, again, you know, I mean, you wouldn't do that unless it was with a nice irony, you know, so.

44:49.872 --> 44:52.535
I liked Roland, but he's business-like.

44:53.276 --> 44:54.117
You've met him before?

44:54.157 --> 45:04.170
This was the first time I'd met him, but he'd corresponded before, and I was asking, you know, he'd occasionally send books over to Britain for me to sign that he managed to get.

45:05.191 --> 45:07.474
And he fooled from where to where, from Missouri?

45:07.574 --> 45:09.176
From Missouri up to D.C.

45:09.216 --> 45:11.479
To Washington, D.C., so that's a pretty good flight.

45:11.519 --> 45:12.680
That's quite across the country.

45:12.760 --> 45:18.107
Yeah, so he said maybe a 3,000 mile round trip or something.

45:18.577 --> 45:20.919
And of course, how many books did he ask you to sign?

45:22.040 --> 45:23.462
Oh, I lost count.

45:23.482 --> 45:23.922
I don't know.

45:24.142 --> 45:25.684
He brought a whole lot of them on the strip?

45:25.704 --> 45:26.104
Yeah.

45:26.124 --> 45:26.885
How many would you think?

45:26.925 --> 45:27.205
Ten?

45:27.666 --> 45:29.267
Oh no, I've got more than that.

45:29.287 --> 45:31.049
More than that, yeah.

45:31.069 --> 45:31.530
More than that.

45:31.670 --> 45:32.571
I can't believe books.

45:32.791 --> 45:33.912
A lot of the same books?

45:35.173 --> 45:40.098
A couple of the same ones, some of the same ones, yeah, but mainly... But they all being signed or just being signed?

45:40.999 --> 45:42.220
Just being signed, yeah.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.161
Do you think he's selling them?

45:43.982 --> 45:44.382
No.

45:44.851 --> 45:46.233
No, I don't, not at all.

45:46.973 --> 45:53.501
I know that he would know about what was on in the literary auction.

45:53.701 --> 46:01.591
My sense is if he brings a box of the same books, and he's asking just to sign them, not to inscribe them to a certain person.

46:01.731 --> 46:03.933
Some of them scribes, some of them.

46:03.953 --> 46:06.757
It almost sounds as if he's in the business.

46:07.257 --> 46:09.600
No, I wouldn't do that.

46:10.081 --> 46:11.002
Check it out.

46:11.262 --> 46:12.624
I'll never get in my book.

46:12.644 --> 46:13.845
My book's closing on Monday.

46:14.517 --> 46:18.481
But let me just write down your tobacco here.

46:19.603 --> 46:22.226
We call it Golden Virginia.

46:22.326 --> 46:22.566
Yeah.

46:22.866 --> 46:24.268
It's hand-rolling tobacco.

46:25.549 --> 46:28.633
And it's a British blend, right?

46:29.073 --> 46:29.374
Yeah.

46:29.614 --> 46:33.318
I've been smoking that since I was 21, you know.

46:33.338 --> 46:34.680
And that doesn't scare you at all?

46:35.020 --> 46:37.062
Well, I gave up for seven years.

46:37.082 --> 46:39.485
I just started smoking again four years ago.

46:39.685 --> 46:40.927
Well, how come?

46:41.327 --> 46:42.448
I used to smoke cigars.

46:42.508 --> 46:43.950
I loved them.

46:44.487 --> 46:49.633
Not all pressure, it's also just kind of, I enjoy smoking.

46:49.653 --> 46:53.938
You said you like to party a little bit, I gather, too.

46:53.958 --> 46:59.224
Well, I like to occasionally just go and have a few beers.

47:02.147 --> 47:11.338
Well, I explain to people, too, that if you're a writer, most of what you do is you're in a house working on your own and not wanting to be disturbed.

47:11.707 --> 47:14.090
That's why I like even doing readings in the house.

47:14.110 --> 47:14.731
You're meeting people.

47:14.951 --> 47:16.313
You don't always meet people.

47:17.134 --> 47:18.656
But also I like to go to pubs.

47:19.818 --> 47:23.423
My wife says she can't understand why I like to go to the post office every day.

47:23.643 --> 47:25.065
Or I like to go to the landfill.

47:27.548 --> 47:28.650
Go ahead.

47:28.670 --> 47:33.516
What's been good is obviously the general interest has been good.

47:34.378 --> 47:38.704
The individual interest from a lot of people and also very knowledgeable about my work.

47:39.465 --> 47:40.566
I've found that it's been

47:41.305 --> 47:46.270
It's been quite exciting and, what do you say, night is a nice thing, you know.

47:46.710 --> 47:51.535
People do know quite a lot of my work has managed to get in the States.

47:51.555 --> 47:52.616
It's kind of pleasing, isn't it?

47:52.896 --> 47:54.117
Very, yeah, very.

47:54.137 --> 48:04.647
And also a lot of the younger... I mean, to be perfectly frank, the people that I usually, that I know see in the States, writers are generally black.

48:08.411 --> 48:09.912
You know, that's who I meet.

48:10.162 --> 48:21.132
I'm friendly with the no, and I don't usually meet radical or white people often with the same politics that I have, you know.

48:21.552 --> 48:23.834
It's not like being South Africa by any means.

48:24.595 --> 48:36.546
But again, it's just nice to meet people who have good beliefs, you know, strong views, especially amongst the younger people, you know.

48:36.566 --> 48:38.768
I mean, on a personal level,

48:39.524 --> 48:51.143
One of the things that isn't so good, but not surprising, is that very few Afro-American people come to the readings amongst the audience.

48:51.603 --> 48:53.947
It's mainly all white people.

48:54.168 --> 48:57.773
It's one of these things that is noticeable.

48:57.793 --> 49:06.207
I'm not so sure that it's a major literary issue.

49:08.617 --> 49:10.999
Put it right here.
