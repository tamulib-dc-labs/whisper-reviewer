00:02.022 --> 00:03.965
You're going to forget it.

00:03.985 --> 00:04.305
Which one?

00:04.325 --> 00:07.230
You said you live very well.

00:07.330 --> 00:07.891
Say that again.

00:08.011 --> 00:08.872
Start for me.

00:08.892 --> 00:09.994
Let me say I live very well.

00:10.174 --> 00:12.998
Are you in the IRS?

00:13.018 --> 00:14.841
I'm not even looking at your watch.

00:14.901 --> 00:17.484
I just want to hear that quote.

00:17.585 --> 00:22.772
But you were leading to catalogs.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.316
You said something.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.078
I live very well.

00:27.239 --> 00:28.841
But my obsession.

00:29.081 --> 00:30.223
I live very well.

00:30.811 --> 00:40.723
I like that too.

00:42.064 --> 00:50.033
No, it's just hard to read at the same time.

00:50.394 --> 00:52.296
The lights got to be on too.

00:53.778 --> 01:00.248
I have an obsession.

01:00.569 --> 01:06.678
There's no question that I am obsessed with the collecting of documents.

01:06.698 --> 01:10.043
Fortunately, Michael and I don't collect exactly the same things.

01:10.084 --> 01:14.250
I like manuscripts a little more than he likes the printed matter.

01:14.230 --> 01:40.114
But I spend many hours reading and researching, and as well as I live with the places that I go and the plays that I attend and all the cultural events, any other time, free time but that, is spent in study, is spent in collecting, is spent in pursuit of, in reading catalogs.

01:40.214 --> 01:43.697
What's wrong with that?

01:44.133 --> 01:48.331
Well, you know, you just made an interesting statement about the condominium.

01:49.154 --> 01:54.497
And I can remember years ago when I was...

01:54.933 --> 02:00.620
with a friend who I was passionately involved with.

02:04.024 --> 02:14.117
We were together early in the morning, and I had a bit at Sotheby's at 10 o'clock, and it was 7 o'clock in the morning.

02:14.557 --> 02:17.481
There was a piece of Georgian silver that came up.

02:17.849 --> 02:19.672
Or early American silver?

02:20.513 --> 02:22.636
No, I was bidding on the phone.

02:22.656 --> 02:23.538
Was it here or there?

02:23.618 --> 02:25.220
I was in L.A.

02:25.281 --> 02:26.623
Where was the sale?

02:26.643 --> 02:27.123
There.

02:27.143 --> 02:29.167
So it was three hours difference.

02:29.187 --> 02:32.632
Yes, I was being distracted and she saw me bid on something.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.516
It was an early American piece of silver.

02:36.117 --> 02:43.028
Did anyone else get interested in a coffee or a cappuccino or a decaf?

02:43.048 --> 02:43.389
Not sure.

02:43.509 --> 02:46.253
And...

02:46.722 --> 02:53.574
She heard me bidding on it, and I showed her what I was bidding on.

02:53.594 --> 02:56.439
It was this John Coney Bowl or something.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.826
She said, $21,000 that thing went for?

03:00.846 --> 03:02.128
She said, $21,000.

03:02.148 --> 03:05.534
I put wheels on it and drive it.

03:05.634 --> 03:09.000
Basically, it's the same kind of thing that you say with the...

03:09.149 --> 03:11.332
Did you get it?

03:11.812 --> 03:14.315
No, I didn't.

03:14.776 --> 03:16.538
Were you the underbidder?

03:16.558 --> 03:18.881
I was the underbidder.

03:19.422 --> 03:23.968
But I have no concept of the value of money.

03:24.949 --> 03:29.875
You must have because you were the underbidder.

03:29.855 --> 03:42.375
As a matter of fact, one of the things I'm most adamant about is that I charge the wealthy as much as I charge the poor.

03:42.935 --> 03:56.016
I do not believe that a wealthy person, but I don't believe that a wealthy patient should pay any more for my services because they are wealthy.

03:56.096 --> 03:58.039
It is not up to me to determine

03:58.458 --> 04:07.673
the distribution... I don't think you should have to apologize for that.

04:08.615 --> 04:24.280
My practice does not in any way affect my collecting except for being an impediment to my reading catalogs that come in early in the morning that are three hours late by the nature of the time zone.

04:24.260 --> 04:30.542
because it supplies no money for me at all in terms of collective.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.392
Fortunately, I have other things to do.

04:33.473 --> 04:37.017
My first appointment is 11 o'clock.

04:37.137 --> 04:38.738
How many days a week?

04:38.999 --> 04:41.641
Two to three days a week.

04:41.662 --> 04:47.167
My first appointment is about that hour.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.969
My first appointment is 11 a.m.

04:49.049 --> 04:55.156
and by that time I've been on the phone to New York since six.

04:55.276 --> 04:58.519
I've been up since six.

04:59.495 --> 05:03.621
And then I go back to bed.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.086
I really do because I'm up.

05:07.106 --> 05:07.507
Oh yeah.

05:07.527 --> 05:15.358
I've been up for, you know, three hours by the time.

05:20.005 --> 05:23.650
The greatest quote I ever heard of books, on books, I ever saw or read.

05:23.670 --> 05:24.211
It's a quote that's an A-B.

05:24.231 --> 05:25.012
You'll never shut him up there.

05:25.032 --> 05:25.713
No, it's this.

05:25.733 --> 05:26.194
It's this.

05:27.068 --> 05:31.223
It was in the verso of a page in the lower left-hand corner when A.B.

05:31.283 --> 05:32.869
was a little octavo-sized.

05:33.571 --> 05:37.365
And it said, my wife said, it's me or the books.

05:37.868 --> 05:38.929
I chose the book.

05:39.049 --> 05:41.192
It's open for this and such and such and such and such.

05:41.252 --> 05:45.878
Really, it's a little warning shed and I've been trying to get that goddamn thing for 10 years.

05:45.938 --> 05:46.238
What?

05:46.619 --> 05:47.680
I'm going to find it.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.562
It's in you.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.443
Go read A.B.

05:50.563 --> 05:51.384
I can tell you.

05:51.404 --> 05:53.987
My wife said it's near the book, so I chose the book.

05:54.088 --> 06:04.500
I like that quote that was under that old catalog about the 18th century man and disposing of his books.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.725
He said, you're going for it.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.225
That's the one.

06:09.426 --> 06:19.217
And the stupid gaze of the... He would much rather send... I would much rather see it to auction so that those... That's in the opening chapter of my book.

06:19.237 --> 06:26.325
So those who follow me... Those who follow me may see the same... It was the embassy galleries who used that quote for 20 years.

06:26.345 --> 06:32.732
Yeah, and I've seen it on the back of their... Someone, I don't know, has written me away... I didn't sell... I didn't sell my books at auction.

06:32.712 --> 06:38.006
You know what I have done in the book?

06:38.026 --> 06:38.929
That was whole.

06:38.949 --> 06:39.069
Oh.

06:39.651 --> 06:40.954
I said it was whole.

06:40.974 --> 06:42.940
You said gremlin.

06:43.060 --> 06:46.690
I said you didn't hear me all first.

06:46.710 --> 06:47.011
Read your tape.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.274
I could see a chase right now.

06:49.300 --> 06:57.518
as being very important in that I don't have time to thoroughly enjoy all the things that I buy.

06:57.558 --> 07:05.976
They come in faster than I can research them.

07:05.956 --> 07:11.764
Well, I peruse them, I look at them, I fondle them, I play with them, but you know what?

07:11.824 --> 07:15.990
I do some research on them, but inevitably it's on to the next thing.

07:16.511 --> 07:20.136
But somewhere in the back of the mind... No, not at all.

07:22.419 --> 07:23.480
No, no, not at all.

07:24.041 --> 07:29.128
In the end, it's somewhere in the back of my mind, I see myself...

07:29.513 --> 07:37.067
stopping that and going back and researching each and every one of those pieces.

07:37.688 --> 07:49.951
Fortunately, the way and the nature of collecting is that if you acquire all these pieces, at some point they start to merge.

07:49.971 --> 07:52.315
That is, especially manuscript documents.

07:53.088 --> 07:58.515
You get a document from here, a document from there, and they all come together.

07:58.615 --> 08:09.889
Like I have five or six documents relating to Samuel Adams and John Hancock, and John Hancock at the Battle of Lexington and getting married.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.493
And they've all come from different sources.

08:13.844 --> 08:24.961
But it's interesting that history is wrong in terms of his moving his then-girlfriend from Boston to Lexington just before the battle.

08:25.001 --> 08:30.250
They were going to get married, and they did when the war broke out.

08:30.270 --> 08:35.838
But I have letters of her brother and all her uncles and all of them.

08:36.379 --> 08:41.387
But they've all merged together, and the history becomes clearer.

08:42.211 --> 08:48.119
When you have them... Oh, well, that's basic to me.

08:48.459 --> 09:04.560
And if you don't have that, and you don't have that reverence for the past... Unfortunately, I think her interest revolves through me.

09:05.882 --> 09:06.423
That's right.

09:06.443 --> 09:10.328
In other words, it's not the true thing.

09:11.455 --> 09:19.529
If she's interested because I'm interested, that doesn't explain the passion, the obsession.

09:20.190 --> 09:26.961
It doesn't explain the exhilaration.

09:27.242 --> 09:31.128
My favorite quote was Howard Carter.

09:34.053 --> 09:37.058
I'm not quite sure.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.022
She collects money.

09:40.383 --> 09:42.266
She's very penurious.

09:43.828 --> 09:44.088
Sorry.

09:44.228 --> 09:45.890
She spends no money at all.

09:46.771 --> 09:47.432
Very little.

09:47.813 --> 09:49.054
She hates to spend money.

09:49.074 --> 09:51.517
She loves to collect money.

09:51.638 --> 09:54.361
No, she doesn't spend my money either.

09:54.381 --> 09:55.503
Are you very lucky?

09:55.523 --> 09:56.424
I am indeed lucky.

09:56.444 --> 09:58.406
She does not spend my money either.

09:58.586 --> 09:59.788
Now do you know what you have?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.219
No.

10:02.279 --> 10:05.023
Do you ever run across things that astonish you that you own them?

10:05.363 --> 10:05.904
Yes.

10:05.924 --> 10:09.910
I have more than once ordered twice the same thing.

10:10.050 --> 10:13.536
I have called a book dealer and I said, I'd like to order this.

10:13.556 --> 10:15.058
And he says, I'm sorry, they're sold.

10:15.639 --> 10:22.649
And I go away with my head hanging and I walk into my office and the UPS shows up and I open the box and there they are.

10:23.010 --> 10:23.871
They're sold all right.

10:23.931 --> 10:26.535
I bought them a month ago.

10:26.515 --> 10:33.483
I've ordered duplicate books.

10:34.584 --> 10:38.268
The same reference source, inevitably.

10:39.610 --> 10:42.553
The kick is getting him?

10:42.573 --> 10:46.117
No, the kick is the history.

10:46.177 --> 10:51.443
The kick is beating Ximena.

10:51.743 --> 11:01.638
The kick is the history.

11:02.078 --> 11:20.265
The previous discussion was held in New York City on Friday

11:21.089 --> 11:30.507
April 19th, during dinner with Michael Zinman and Dr. Gary Millan of Beverly Hills, California.

11:31.148 --> 11:35.697
This was after we had attended the New York Book Fair.

11:35.757 --> 11:37.039
We got together at a restaurant.
