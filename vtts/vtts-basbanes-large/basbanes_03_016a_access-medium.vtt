WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:11.693
I'd say it on tape, you know, anything that I choose to quote directly, I'll be more than happy to run by you.

00:11.713 --> 00:14.176
And we're rolling, and we're talking to David.

00:14.196 --> 00:18.201
And how do you pronounce your name?

00:18.221 --> 00:19.543
It's David Bromwich.

00:19.623 --> 00:20.965
Bromwich, yep.

00:20.985 --> 00:21.706
G-O-F-M-G-O-I-C-V, right?

00:21.726 --> 00:22.046
I-C-H.

00:22.066 --> 00:22.587
H. Yep.

00:22.807 --> 00:27.573
And you've been here how long?

00:27.833 --> 00:30.297
I've been teaching at Yale, I guess, 17 years.

00:30.417 --> 00:31.438
This is my 18th.

00:31.418 --> 00:52.228
I think this is my eighth year on the board, and it's my second year as chair of the publication.

00:52.613 --> 01:18.413
Could you do a swordfish on panini?

01:20.516 --> 01:21.017
That'd be great.

01:21.554 --> 01:34.262
Yeah, I published other universities in Yale, and that one time was Clark Court-Rey.

01:34.282 --> 01:41.638
And now, I mean, I'm under contact to William Wang and Penguin for a biography first.

01:42.057 --> 01:51.395
It's well on its way, closer to the end of the beginning, I think.

01:51.495 --> 01:55.363
It's a biography, I think?

01:55.383 --> 01:55.924
It's a critical biography.

01:57.006 --> 01:57.607
It sounds fascinating.

01:57.627 --> 02:00.032
I saw a message in Lincoln with that book.

02:00.012 --> 02:17.835
I wish I had a little riff on Lincoln in my new book.

02:18.170 --> 02:25.862
Well, he's always thinking.

02:26.162 --> 02:43.789
When you read me, I hear co-teach a class on Lincoln from time to time.

02:44.191 --> 03:08.988
Most of the reading is from his speeches and writings, and we did some from Webster, Emerson, and others.

03:09.008 --> 03:10.470
So tell me a little bit about your chairman of the publication committee.

03:10.490 --> 03:10.991
That's fascinating to me.

03:11.011 --> 03:11.652
Tell me a little bit about that.

03:11.672 --> 03:13.995
Well, we receive a packet of books, that is to say, cover notes, reader's reports, descriptions of books,

03:14.431 --> 03:17.608
and often a sample from the book.

03:17.909 --> 03:21.910
In different states of readiness for people, there are books...

03:22.177 --> 03:35.418
that an editor is asking us to encourage, which maybe to get an early contract with, or just to tell the author Yale would be very interested.

03:35.438 --> 03:41.808
I think at this stage they don't come to us unless the editor wants to go for a contract.

03:42.549 --> 03:45.113
Then we get books that are

03:45.582 --> 03:51.520
finished and only waiting for approval.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.763
But under contract?

03:52.783 --> 03:58.540
And needing a contract and approval or, you know, since they already have a contract.

03:58.641 --> 04:00.486
And those books can be

04:01.867 --> 04:13.206
In different states of, how to say, unfinished completion, too.

04:13.226 --> 04:20.939
That is, some of them have been commented on and criticized by one reader or another in ways the author is asked to respond to.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.465
So one reads through the whole package and tries to arrive at such a... Writing reports.

04:24.445 --> 04:29.270
And I didn't realize how important that is.

04:29.290 --> 04:30.971
They are important.

04:30.991 --> 04:33.174
As a writer, it makes me sick.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.716
I hope I haven't, you know, touched somebody's chances.

04:35.736 --> 04:37.478
I can't really say if you're a writer.

04:37.498 --> 04:44.845
Well, it's important that it's, in a way, the detail of what the referee says is more important than the yes or no.

04:45.125 --> 04:48.909
Because there's very seldom a straight out no.

04:49.410 --> 04:50.531
Well, that's not true.

04:50.671 --> 04:51.752
I should say, on the...

04:52.087 --> 04:56.996
on the Publications Committee, we don't see books that Garlock's can have.

04:57.016 --> 04:57.878
They don't get to that.

04:57.898 --> 05:11.344
The editors weed them out, and we're told that I think the proportion we've seen of the total books that includes manuscripts that disappear,

05:11.324 --> 05:26.939
books that are offered in letters with heavy descriptions so that the editors can judge what's data.

05:27.220 --> 05:36.108
I think we see only about one in a hundred that comes to this level, but of books that have been in some way encouraged by the editors, what proportion we see somewhat larger.

05:36.128 --> 05:36.989
How often do you meet?

05:37.009 --> 05:37.990
It used to be monthly, it's now every six weeks.

05:38.189 --> 05:40.593
I'd like to sit in on one of these at some point.

05:40.773 --> 05:47.124
And again, with the understanding... I have no position on that at all.

05:47.264 --> 05:51.191
It would be John Donatitz and John Moran.

05:51.231 --> 05:58.864
But I think, except for swearing you an oath of confidentiality... I'd be more interested to see how you feel about your deliberations.

05:59.435 --> 06:08.226
Do you have anything to say about anything specific?

06:08.246 --> 06:09.908
Feel free to ask them.

06:09.928 --> 06:16.576
The publishing process is kind of what I'm trying to do here and get a handle on it.

06:16.596 --> 06:20.661
You guys really are going to help me with that.

06:21.542 --> 06:26.388
We're the last toll gate, however you want to be.

06:26.949 --> 06:28.851
You know, what we do

06:29.405 --> 06:39.738
Now, a little more than in earlier years, or under the immediately previous committees, is advisory.

06:39.838 --> 06:49.551
But there's something said about, oh, every other book or so that can be passed on to the author or that is meant to be.

06:49.571 --> 06:53.356
And do you try and read as many of these manuscripts as you can?

06:53.376 --> 06:54.417
Of full manuscripts?

06:54.734 --> 06:57.178
But that's only occasionally.

06:57.198 --> 07:08.135
I mean, if there's a manuscript that an editor tells that you really ought to look at this much cost the discussion, or I want you to look at it for other reasons, even though it's already gone to the package of approval.

07:08.155 --> 07:18.632
More often, I'll look at a manuscript in an earlier stage when an editor, usually John Culka or Jonathan Brent or Laura Heimer, when she was here, you know, wants

07:18.983 --> 07:28.658
a view of it from someone outside who wants to know if their house is the same as yours or whatever.

07:28.938 --> 07:35.288
And I still write these reports occasionally, and I get paid the usual readers for writing for that.

07:35.521 --> 07:40.286
There's not time enough in my, I teach a full schedule, so.

07:40.306 --> 07:42.108
Have you enjoyed doing this?

07:42.408 --> 07:43.129
This job.

07:43.249 --> 07:45.432
Have you enjoyed your reading on most occasions?

07:45.452 --> 08:00.908
Yeah, I would say at least, you know, I feel I'm being useful, and sometimes with a startling negative, expletive reaction, and sometimes with the reverse, you know, maybe you can see them getting the book.

08:00.928 --> 08:04.552
So what do you try to bring to the process in the review?

08:04.572 --> 08:04.752
You know,

08:04.732 --> 08:16.952
What I know in the areas of learning that I have any feelings with is poetry, romanticism, some projects.

08:17.388 --> 08:28.383
on political writing or 18th century, 19th century politics.

08:28.403 --> 08:32.508
I mean, there's things I know and things I don't know.

08:32.528 --> 08:40.819
And if it comes down to giving an opinion on something I'm much farther from, where it's just more sense or does this make a joke or whatever, unless it's a very obvious case, I'm fairly modest.

08:40.839 --> 08:43.302
They pull back and advise people to go to somewhere else.

08:43.322 --> 08:46.787
And I think most, I mean, I think that's part of being a conscientious, you know, servant of the

08:46.953 --> 08:53.787
of the craft is not to overextend.

08:54.268 --> 08:58.517
So, and pardon my general question.

08:58.537 --> 08:59.359
At some point, I want to get back to you.

08:59.879 --> 09:14.898
Do you have a sense of the glory of the university press in the 21st century?

09:14.918 --> 09:17.982
That's a good question.

09:18.002 --> 09:23.028
And, of course, we're looking at arguably the most successful universities in the United States that operate in America.

09:23.048 --> 09:24.790
Well, I think the statement of mission to the press says something.

09:25.225 --> 09:26.868
Did I use that word?

09:26.888 --> 09:27.689
No, you did not.

09:27.830 --> 09:41.614
I'm revealing to you that I vaguely remember what it said, which is it's about to promote free inquiry and to represent what is

09:42.809 --> 09:47.059
Most worthwhile in learning in the various fields.

09:48.241 --> 09:53.954
Do you generally support the curriculum of the university?

09:54.495 --> 10:01.932
Do I. I'm thinking in terms of one who's written at some length about special collections.

10:01.912 --> 10:19.082
And there really is an argument in places like this where we should collect things that kind of vaguely support what we do as a... Yeah, where Yale collections are used, or where Yale talent and their archival parties are... I think Yale Press could do that more than it does.

10:19.262 --> 10:25.793
I'd be happy to see it encourage that sort of use of local resources that are also of very general interest.

10:25.773 --> 10:28.118
a little more than it does.

10:28.138 --> 10:29.742
I mean, your book is a sort of example.

10:29.762 --> 10:34.052
One can think of it as the Beinecke or the Franklin Project or whatnot.

10:34.072 --> 10:42.972
You know, there are collections or editions that Yale has done relating to papers that are here, and the Franklin, for example.

10:42.952 --> 10:57.356
and the Walpole is another where there are massive additions and the press is relating not to the curriculum but to the on-the-ground scholarly research.

10:58.959 --> 11:08.335
Right now, if you look at departments like classic history, English, you know, I don't think there is

11:08.315 --> 11:18.467
I don't think there is a very close correlation between what the press publishes and those deals.

11:18.587 --> 11:33.645
I've talked to the editors about this, and I think in earlier years, say 35 years ago, this press and others probably erred on the side of local loyalty.

11:33.665 --> 11:36.769
I think now the error may be on the other side.

11:36.749 --> 11:54.172
It would do no harm and might do a lot of good all around, but for best editors to be more conversing with the scholars in their field.

11:54.593 --> 11:57.677
So that's been a change of, you know, corporate culture at university presses generally, but maybe.

11:57.877 --> 12:00.982
specifically here that people work in their offices.

12:01.022 --> 12:02.244
Sometimes they work at home.

12:02.925 --> 12:07.272
They can email or occasionally travel to conferences to visit scholars.

12:07.913 --> 12:11.658
Sometimes editors meet Yale scholars in Chicago.

12:11.699 --> 12:23.597
But I think formerly an eminent professor of literature or history, you know, telephones,

12:23.847 --> 12:32.822
an older and gentile and literate person who's working at the net of the press.

12:33.022 --> 12:36.247
My next book is on cotton mather and spectral evidence.

12:36.267 --> 12:40.033
I think you'll like it, and oh, who would you like as a reader, and so on.

12:40.073 --> 12:44.100
It worked rather differently.

12:44.468 --> 12:50.875
I think it'll be brought back a little more into some kind of equipoise, some appropriate balance.

12:50.955 --> 12:59.385
Part of this is that... And I didn't mean to sidetrack, but to get back to the original question about your... Oh, the idea of what a press does.

12:59.685 --> 13:06.493
I think it should be considered the...

13:06.862 --> 13:13.961
You know, the publishing backbone of intellectual life.

13:14.021 --> 13:16.728
I mean, if the university press like Yale isn't that, what is?

13:16.748 --> 13:18.813
You can't name any magazines.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.758
You can't make fields of study that work that way.

13:20.778 --> 13:23.706
You can't name a high school curriculum or a general college curriculum.

13:23.973 --> 13:31.663
So, you know, I am for keeping it intellectually serious and academic.

13:32.043 --> 13:34.586
Is Congress important, too?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.108
I mean, this is a very successful press.

13:37.290 --> 13:50.166
I think it's important that the press be on the map and have its reputation in such good order that its books are notes, as Yale Press books now are.

13:50.146 --> 13:54.193
very nicely noticed in the New York Times.

13:54.533 --> 13:59.361
Well, I mean, it's not a profit.

13:59.381 --> 14:03.047
On the other hand, it's not a profit organization.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.449
The bottom line, it doesn't work at all.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.651
But it's profitable.

14:05.671 --> 14:05.911
Yeah.

14:06.352 --> 14:08.596
And it's a tricky balance to keep.

14:08.676 --> 14:16.288
I mean, I think that you take these factors into consideration when you're sitting in judgment.

14:16.640 --> 14:21.975
To my knowledge, I've never approved a book that people thought was

14:22.630 --> 14:29.457
trash or was lacking, was trash, garbage, or lacking in the relevant learning.

14:29.817 --> 14:37.765
But we've approved popular books, including some that, you know, persons on the board thought were written down in a way that they wouldn't do it themselves.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.707
There's occasional books like that.

14:39.767 --> 14:48.435
We've approved books that are also, you know, written too much in the terms of art of a given field of study, whether it's medicine or

14:48.415 --> 14:58.033
or whatever, editors try to work with that and try to work more to bring the language into something like that.

14:58.734 --> 15:00.197
I think that continues to be a problem.

15:00.257 --> 15:04.585
Do you place a value on the quality of the writing?

15:04.953 --> 15:07.056
At the extremes, definitely.

15:07.076 --> 15:20.918
That is, if I see a project where, from the writing sample in the packet, I can tell that there's real mastery, both of how the material is conveyed and seemingly of the material, that's impressive.

15:20.978 --> 15:29.070
And if I see a reservation in a letter, I'm probably going to use my own judgment and say, well, maybe that's an academic opponent of some sort.

15:29.050 --> 15:37.962
starts accordingly, and if I see something where from the sample one can tell that it's abominably written, then the question comes up for the editor.

15:37.982 --> 15:43.129
What's happened to the sample?

15:43.269 --> 15:45.592
Are you working on the sentences?

15:45.732 --> 15:51.059
And, you know, you press that way and hope that the author recognizes it's not yet in a suitable place.

15:51.079 --> 15:55.746
Mary Lesh told me this morning that she used to go to the public in training.

15:55.766 --> 15:58.990
There would be a list of what she called A books, B books, and C books.

15:58.970 --> 16:11.728
And they were divided strictly by one marketability.

16:11.748 --> 16:13.273
5,000 copies or more, and B would be somewhere between... I got the wrapper.

16:13.293 --> 16:13.654
I got the wrapper.

16:14.326 --> 16:21.037
I'd like water too.

16:21.138 --> 16:34.821
It's not so overt now, but there's a print run on the bottom of each cover sheet.

16:34.941 --> 16:39.068
Anyway, they appear in every item in the packet.

16:39.453 --> 16:52.129
One can always ask the editor or, you know, Jonathan or Jonathan, or Tina, because we can get discussed among them before the production runs.

16:53.010 --> 17:00.620
Sometimes the committee acting in an advisory way will say, this isn't going to sell as much as you think we don't believe.

17:00.640 --> 17:08.970
Or, more generally, this is a better seller than you may realize now because the subject is so...

17:09.642 --> 17:13.028
But these issues do come up in your meeting.

17:13.048 --> 17:14.610
Yeah, but books aren't.

17:15.191 --> 17:17.154
You don't know.

17:17.475 --> 17:25.468
Just looking at an item, you don't know what the editor or the editorial board thinks of it or with what attitude.

17:25.488 --> 17:32.259
But you don't necessarily take these factors into account in deciding whether or not you think it's your opponent.

17:32.439 --> 17:33.040
Not at all.

17:33.081 --> 17:34.303
Not at all.

17:34.343 --> 17:36.426
Really, it's the merit that matters.

17:36.710 --> 17:46.551
Well, I think there's some law of natural selection that's working now, even in academic publishing, more than it used to, and that a book that is

17:46.717 --> 18:06.268
you know, promoted by two or three able persons in the field, and it receives pretty good but not extraordinary readers across, by a full professor at a respectable university may get turned down now before even reaching the board, whereas in earlier years it would just go forward.

18:06.369 --> 18:09.113
But by the time they get to us,

18:09.852 --> 18:11.174
that doesn't have been made.

18:11.214 --> 18:12.296
This is a trade book.

18:12.316 --> 18:22.032
We really can hope to sell 20,000 books, but it's a contribution to learning to John Lucas's recent books or examples like that.

18:22.052 --> 18:22.493
Which book?

18:22.573 --> 18:28.603
Lucas's books like on Winston Churchill and The End of the War.

18:29.461 --> 18:32.726
There was a book on democracy.

18:33.207 --> 18:41.841
Anyway, he's published three or four now, fairly small, not too much good as a pamphlet size, with Yale.

18:41.861 --> 18:45.606
And these are in that middle category, if not runaway bestsellers.

18:45.887 --> 18:48.311
Are they important in a scholarly?

18:48.371 --> 18:50.134
They're good enough in a scholarly way.

18:50.154 --> 18:52.277
They're felt to have an audience, and they sell well.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.839
They sell better than a scholar.

18:54.160 --> 18:54.861
So that...

18:54.841 --> 19:00.591
That's an example of that little category.

19:05.298 --> 19:14.614
My father, why don't you go ahead and have a break.

19:14.634 --> 19:14.774
I will.

19:14.794 --> 19:19.622
We're talking about, you know, tenure.

19:19.642 --> 19:20.764
Do you feel some kind of...

19:21.115 --> 19:24.701
The book is really being championed, especially an editor.

19:24.721 --> 19:26.083
There's very pressure coming in.

19:26.104 --> 19:31.954
Do you occasionally feel pressure coming in to give us a fast read on it?

19:31.974 --> 19:34.538
To get a fast reading for the sake of a tender decision?

19:34.658 --> 19:36.081
No, I've never felt that.

19:36.241 --> 19:36.822
And I haven't.

19:37.082 --> 19:38.685
I haven't especially felt

19:38.986 --> 19:55.134
that the Yale Press editors are used in a networking way to advance the cases of people who are at that stage, and the book is the necessary bargaining system.

19:55.154 --> 20:02.327
But I think in general that is a problem, and I think for academic publishing, including Yale Press books, the shapes that books get put into by their authors

20:02.965 --> 20:09.718
have a lot to do with the conventions of academic research at a given time.

20:09.738 --> 20:11.501
And in my field, those have changed enormously in the last of their years.

20:11.682 --> 20:13.124
You see a different kind of book.

20:14.828 --> 20:20.839
You don't see, for example, critical studies of an individual author very often, even as somebody's second or third book.

20:20.819 --> 20:25.390
That's considered hard to publish and people don't even try it.

20:25.410 --> 20:35.875
But cultural studies, it mixes something about material culture and the lifestyle of the high bourgeoisie in the end of the 19th century.

20:35.855 --> 20:38.259
French literature and American literature.

20:38.539 --> 20:50.136
I mean, if you get the right mix of things, academics, even in their middle stage of their careers, are willing to go out on a limb and try, and try to do a little over their head.

20:50.156 --> 20:57.627
I mean, there is a perception among people who should know better that university presses are not necessarily at Yale, and I think this is probably not the case at Yale.

20:58.298 --> 21:03.209
You know, they are fundamentally two public institutions.

21:03.570 --> 21:16.999
You know, I know that from somebody who was recently an editor of Yale, who in going to conferences had a great deal of criticism from people in the humanities field saying,

21:16.979 --> 21:18.803
You don't publish us.

21:18.823 --> 21:30.326
You've given up on your mission, which is to serve us, which is to serve the office of advancing tenure and keeping things going in the profession.

21:30.346 --> 21:31.528
And it's true that in that sense,

21:31.964 --> 21:41.073
the better known university presses have fallen off.

21:41.834 --> 21:52.304
If that is their responsibility, not only Yale, but Harvard, Chicago, others have fallen off nonsense.

21:52.324 --> 21:57.709
Do you think there is a function, there is that function of the university press?

21:58.290 --> 22:01.853
I'm sure it does, but it is the biggest misconception.

22:03.757 --> 22:16.838
I think what gets how a book published on academic stress is formed is from a kind of negotiation between the author and the author

22:17.375 --> 22:41.526
usually fairly heavily influenced by what's going in the field and an editor who should know the field but also stands for the general reader or stands for the reader with some knowledge but not the most usually not the most special i mean i'm one of the five world experts on the subject of the book and that in that way a book gets shaped that is not uh

22:42.012 --> 22:50.182
exactly like a conference paper times 10, but that comes out of the interests and even, and for better or worse, the conventions of academic work in the field.

22:50.202 --> 23:00.174
And I don't think the expectation is right on either side that, you know, from the academic perspective, they should just publish what we're doing.

23:00.995 --> 23:06.001
Or from the fact perspective, the public has rejected the present-shaped academic discourse.

23:06.021 --> 23:07.784
It's obscurantist and over-professionalized.

23:07.964 --> 23:08.965
We'll do what we want.

23:08.945 --> 23:10.767
will create a discovery.

23:10.927 --> 23:11.929
They can.

23:11.969 --> 23:14.151
Who are they going to go to?

23:14.231 --> 23:18.096
They're going to go to scholars.

23:18.116 --> 23:19.177
Where are scholars?

23:19.198 --> 23:19.598
In universities.

23:19.618 --> 23:32.213
Are you going to prevent them from being influenced by, you know, the going ways of doing things in their subject?

23:32.253 --> 23:33.315
There's no way to do that, so.

23:33.335 --> 23:33.535
Thank you.

23:33.818 --> 23:49.498
Well, I once wrote something for, like,

23:49.782 --> 23:52.746
It has disappeared from off their bibliography.

23:52.766 --> 23:58.954
And there is somebody named David Bromwich who was supposed to review the book by Jamaica Kincaid, but it wasn't me.

23:58.974 --> 24:06.683
So my confidence in it is, you know, correspondingly a little bit under pressure compared to what I think about book culture.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.145
But I use it.

24:08.165 --> 24:11.049
I use the Internet a lot to read the newspapers.

24:11.189 --> 24:13.272
He's doing foreign papers that I can't read.

24:13.452 --> 24:18.979
I was just doing a search of Amazon to see how they're doing pre-selling my book.

24:19.702 --> 24:22.106
And that's okay.

24:22.206 --> 24:25.952
I mean, whoever wants to buy it is buying it.

24:25.972 --> 24:27.454
But there's no image there.

24:27.474 --> 24:28.916
I'm doing a search of myself.

24:28.936 --> 24:31.400
I'm the author of a book I haven't heard of before.

24:32.021 --> 24:34.064
There could be two, Nicholas.

24:34.124 --> 24:37.329
There are no other vast beings in the world.

24:37.349 --> 24:43.559
It's either going to be myself or my brother.

24:43.579 --> 24:47.785
There are only eight people in America.

24:47.765 --> 24:57.488
Somebody types it in.

24:58.261 --> 25:05.010
But on the other side, the book is not available.

25:05.030 --> 25:06.652
You can't buy it.

25:06.772 --> 25:09.596
This book I reportedly wrote.

25:09.616 --> 25:21.171
But no, I mean, in terms of the electronic book, the kind of, as the alternative say, for publishing a dissertation that might only sell $500.

25:22.113 --> 25:24.015
That means the book will creep out.

25:23.995 --> 25:25.357
on your own.

25:25.377 --> 25:29.724
You download it, you print it out on your own.

25:29.744 --> 25:34.933
I suppose, but it even has these other different, you know.

25:35.073 --> 25:35.674
Searching, linking.

25:35.994 --> 25:40.962
Searching, I mean, that's really fantastic.

25:41.002 --> 25:44.268
That really is, you can link to various things and equipment.

25:44.288 --> 25:46.491
You get the entire citation that pops up.

25:46.571 --> 25:47.974
That's exciting.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.319
It's not an unusual view, but my view is.

25:51.299 --> 25:56.297
For people who already know what they're doing, it's an enormous help because it speeds things up.

25:56.615 --> 26:24.394
for people who don't know what they're doing it prevents them ever learning because they use the length culture they don't read through books they're convinced that their topical lines are you know piercing the structure of the universe and it it it promotes uh slickness speed um so do you allow your students to incite them oh i can't stop them i just want to stop them but i i recommend books mainly you require it

26:25.353 --> 26:29.059
I recommend it.

26:29.399 --> 26:31.062
I recommend secondaries.

26:31.082 --> 26:34.567
I thought you meant you require the Internet.

26:34.587 --> 26:36.871
No, no, no, I meant the book.

26:36.891 --> 26:40.517
No, no, no, no, no, I meant the book.

26:40.637 --> 26:45.825
No, no, no, no, no, I meant the book.

26:46.767 --> 27:09.298
In things like senior seminars and graduate papers, it's understood that some of their research will be in here.

27:09.278 --> 27:19.834
Some of them do, but here, I mean, what I teach is mainly a bit of critical textual.

27:20.054 --> 27:21.176
So, it's critical.

27:21.196 --> 27:29.548
That is to say, I teach primary text like the Freeluge or Great Expectations.

27:29.528 --> 27:47.391
And I'm compared effectually, you know, which would you prefer, the polio or the quartile, this or that way, that kind of work would be, which is integral, and needs a separatism.

27:47.411 --> 27:48.833
I don't do that.

27:49.493 --> 27:54.760
But I've done work in the body, and she was doing it often, and much more often.

27:54.740 --> 28:07.511
Dissertation writers who reach the state where they know they need materials from the pamphlet form of the 1790s or whatnot, but they're not going to find anywhere else.

28:07.531 --> 28:10.639
I'm going to pick up a little book about 15 times a year and the rest of this.

28:10.619 --> 28:24.772
What would you be most interested in seeing?

28:24.792 --> 28:40.626
I'd like to hear about or learn about the change in mores and the change in understanding of what the press was supposed to do and what

28:40.606 --> 28:44.634
From the beginning?

28:45.155 --> 28:47.279
From the beginning, which is when exactly?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.844
Well, it'll be a hundred years in the end.

28:49.924 --> 28:59.222
I'd also like to see it explain to me how the... I mean, I think...

29:00.215 --> 29:15.912
I don't think there's any exact tracking that goes on in this, but to what extent the vision of intellectual culture and math culture in the society is tracked.

29:15.892 --> 29:25.766
by the difference between the kind of books, Yale University Press and the kind of books that say Random House or Crown Publisher.

29:27.088 --> 29:34.298
Yeah, I think that this university press has stayed very personal and intellectual by comparison with some.

29:34.438 --> 29:40.887
It's only in the last seven or eight years that it's gone, started to go.

29:41.305 --> 29:42.828
to trade in a significant way.

29:43.169 --> 29:46.174
Do you think that's a bad thing or a good thing or a necessary thing?

29:46.475 --> 29:49.701
I think the balance right now is about right.

29:49.781 --> 29:56.935
I suppose I see myself as putting on the brakes when necessary and hoping to have good trade books to applaud.

29:56.915 --> 30:09.309
But I don't think people work in university press editing or any other kind of editing need to be encouraged to go for the dollars, to go for the readers.

30:09.369 --> 30:10.030
They feel it.

30:10.110 --> 30:12.112
They want that kind of success.

30:12.192 --> 30:18.780
And in wanting it, their reading will repress or labor or whatever.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.623
But on the other hand, they argue that

30:21.603 --> 30:32.755
If they really want to publish the kinds of books that the male would like to yield when the poets... Yeah, the others need to sell them.

30:32.775 --> 30:34.460
And so there's that argument.

30:34.601 --> 30:36.827
And then it's a persuasive argument.

30:36.807 --> 30:53.550
There was a book by Alan Dershowitz that proposed

30:53.530 --> 31:00.386
a legal method of handling authorization for torture after 9-11.

31:00.627 --> 31:02.371
I think that was a fast idea.

31:02.872 --> 31:09.708
I don't know that I would say it hit my ideas of what scholarly reflection ought to mean.

31:10.190 --> 31:11.252
There's an example of

31:11.232 --> 31:15.005
something just on the boundary for sure.

31:15.025 --> 31:16.029
I wonder what that is.

31:16.049 --> 31:22.009
It had advocates at the press, and it had readers' reports from representing Scotland.

31:22.090 --> 31:22.631
It's interesting.

31:22.772 --> 31:23.976
I checked again at Smith.

31:24.175 --> 31:32.705
He's doing the history of the university, but he's not including the place.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.628
Thank you very much.

31:35.708 --> 31:39.152
Do you want tea, coffee, or tea?

31:39.172 --> 31:39.332
I don't.

31:39.352 --> 31:41.214
Do you want tea, coffee, or tea?

31:41.234 --> 31:41.775
No, I'm fine.

31:41.795 --> 31:44.778
In fact, you probably want to get your... Five more minutes.

31:44.798 --> 31:46.520
Pick this up, perhaps, at another time.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.802
Another time would be good.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.325
Can you give me your email address and a phone number?

31:50.585 --> 31:52.427
Email is...

31:52.407 --> 31:54.052
David.

31:54.874 --> 31:55.275
David.

31:55.716 --> 31:57.421
Bromwich at Yale.edu.

31:57.461 --> 31:58.524
That's right.

31:58.544 --> 32:05.183
And I emailed you.

32:05.203 --> 32:07.429
What was that?

32:07.409 --> 32:13.643
Dennis had said that he wanted me to look into the Vinland map.

32:13.944 --> 32:21.301
Of course, he's the historian.

32:21.361 --> 32:25.671
He wants you to look at the embarrassment.

32:25.651 --> 32:32.363
And then he said there were two books published in the 1930s that were just outlined in the New Deal and Roosevelt.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.910
Along with the academic culture of that car.

32:35.930 --> 32:41.280
And he said they were just books that nobody else in America were to publish.

32:41.260 --> 32:46.851
I certainly don't even know about that.

32:46.871 --> 32:52.001
I think in literature it was more chaste, less ideological or whatever, at least in the 30s.

32:52.021 --> 32:55.007
So do you think the press should be doing fiction by all means?

32:55.308 --> 33:00.518
But I think it should be interested in

33:00.498 --> 33:15.593
reprinted with maybe minimal readerly scholarly help, you know, an introduction or whatnot, you know, classics of fiction, books, distinguished books in translation that have gone out of print, that kind of thing.

33:15.613 --> 33:18.760
I think Yale could do much more of it, but I don't think it should be published.

33:18.740 --> 33:28.034
except that you're arguably, as I said earlier, you're one of your best-selling books of all time in the play.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.357
It's a dramatic work.

33:30.678 --> 33:32.420
That's true.

33:32.440 --> 33:32.941
That's true.

33:32.961 --> 33:33.662
You're right.

33:33.722 --> 33:34.744
That's an anomaly.

33:34.884 --> 33:37.248
Or it continues to be.

33:37.268 --> 33:38.610
I mean, it's very odd.

33:38.630 --> 33:39.691
The year of that is 1950-something.

33:39.972 --> 33:40.933
So, I mean, O'Neill...

33:40.913 --> 33:46.347
had been three decades in American limelight, and it was a classic by then.

33:46.368 --> 33:53.386
So it's not exactly like publishing some of those third, fourth or fourth novels, but it is a contemporary writing.

33:53.466 --> 33:56.695
I'd like to take a photo of it.
