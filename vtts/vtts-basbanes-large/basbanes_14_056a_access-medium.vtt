WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:06.039
Can you just give me your full name for the tape?

00:06.279 --> 00:06.380
Sure.

00:07.561 --> 00:08.923
My name is John Dean.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.786
I'm Director of the Department of Preservation and Conservation.

00:13.128 --> 00:29.447
And to tell you a little bit about the department, first of all, we have ten units here, the staff of 35, that are concerned primarily with, well, preservation of all the university library and archive materials.

00:30.592 --> 00:35.377
The units include, obviously, scanning and digitization.

00:36.338 --> 00:48.211
We really began—we really pioneered this technology beginning, latter end of 1989, working in cooperation, the Xerox Corporation.

00:48.231 --> 00:49.673
And were you here at that time too?

00:49.973 --> 00:51.875
Yeah, I started this program in 1985.

00:51.915 --> 00:53.817
This is your baby.

00:54.298 --> 00:55.539
Right.

00:55.659 --> 01:00.244
But we, as I said, we have ten units.

01:01.152 --> 01:10.347
A good many of our staff are concerned with actual conservation treatment, restoring books, manuscripts, and so on.

01:10.367 --> 01:21.606
And our work in Cambodia really is a result of the Southeast Asian programs here at Cornell, which are very strong.

01:22.427 --> 01:27.075
Cornell Southeast Asian book collections are actually the strongest in the world, significantly stronger than

01:27.612 --> 01:33.000
And how did that happen?

01:33.821 --> 01:35.123
They started collecting early.

01:35.163 --> 01:55.594
You know, they're collections that were built to support local programs here at Cornell.

01:57.886 --> 02:03.792
It clearly went through a lot of hard times.

02:04.773 --> 02:07.315
Certainly... You're talking about the country now, of course.

02:07.335 --> 02:07.516
Right.

02:08.877 --> 02:14.443
Incredible corruption under various leaders supported by the United States.

02:14.663 --> 02:20.429
Most recent was Meng Nol, who the Khmer Rouge overthrew.

02:20.449 --> 02:27.876
And of course it went through a very, really awful period of Khmer Rouge occupation of the country.

02:28.531 --> 02:38.705
during which time not only were a great many people destroyed, but there were a great many books and manuscripts destroyed also.

02:39.146 --> 02:42.290
Were these in formal repositories and libraries?

02:42.310 --> 02:43.492
Well, it was a national library.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.936
And that was in Pell-Pen, is that right?

02:46.116 --> 02:46.216
Yeah.

02:46.236 --> 02:54.808
The Guglutek, the Guglutek, the Camborish, as it was called.

02:56.864 --> 03:15.176
There's a number of collections there, the National Library right next to it, the National Archives, the School of Fine Arts, and more modern materials such as the Archives of Tule Sling, which became very important.

03:15.417 --> 03:16.198
Could you spell that?

03:16.719 --> 03:17.280
Tule Sling.

03:18.362 --> 03:21.167
There's an article that I wrote here.

03:21.350 --> 03:22.672
American Archivist.

03:22.732 --> 03:23.493
Oh, great.

03:23.513 --> 03:27.698
And this has a lot of the, this has a lot of numbers in here that you might find useful.

03:27.718 --> 03:28.779
Is there something I could have?

03:28.959 --> 03:29.040
Yes.

03:29.060 --> 03:29.140
Oh.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.342
I made this copy for you.

03:31.362 --> 03:33.505
And there's some nice little sort of photographs in there.

03:33.525 --> 03:34.226
Excellent.

03:34.246 --> 03:36.669
Super.

03:36.929 --> 03:41.595
In fact, I would love copies of just anything that you think is pertinent.

03:41.615 --> 03:41.735
Right.

03:41.976 --> 03:45.079
And not just the Cambodia project, but… Right.

03:45.820 --> 03:48.724
These are some photographs from

03:49.784 --> 03:57.517
Actually, there's a lot of stuff in here also from Vietnam, too, because we've done a lot of work elsewhere.

04:00.141 --> 04:01.744
This is a good example here.

04:03.066 --> 04:11.120
When the Khmer Rouge carrying them, they threw a lot of materials out of the National Library, including a lot of really important political manuscripts.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.564
Many of them were rescued by citizens.

04:14.303 --> 04:17.027
And this is an example of a hawker's palm leaf.

04:17.187 --> 04:21.853
Of course, palm leaf manuscript precisely doesn't sound like.

04:21.873 --> 04:25.097
These are paper that's made from palm leaf.

04:25.157 --> 04:27.280
Well, no, it's actually the palm leaf itself.

04:28.562 --> 04:31.606
It's just a palm leaf cut in strips.

04:33.088 --> 04:34.550
And are they ancient documents?

04:35.311 --> 04:40.237
Some of them are for the second century, some of them are more recent.

04:40.257 --> 04:42.420
The method of preservation

04:42.704 --> 04:48.072
This is true throughout the Southeast Asia, except for Vietnam.

04:48.092 --> 04:52.499
Method of preservation is essentially copying, constant copying for centuries.

04:52.519 --> 05:04.557
And it's rather difficult to tell which of 15th century, which of the 19th century, which of even early 20th century.

05:04.577 --> 05:07.141
But generally, the materials are exactly the same.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.686
The weight of deterioration is dependent as much on

05:11.071 --> 05:13.053
environmental conditions.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.255
It's just aging.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.898
Is this something I can take to it?

05:18.918 --> 05:20.820
Let me see if I can find a copy.

05:20.860 --> 05:27.205
These are what was being done there.

05:29.087 --> 05:34.051
This is work in the actual royal palace of Cambodia.

05:34.151 --> 05:37.574
This is essential for me, actually.

05:38.215 --> 05:39.576
These are Cambodian

05:41.294 --> 05:57.113
Now, is this all this work done under your guidance?

05:57.253 --> 05:59.015
Oh yes, I trained all this work.

05:59.035 --> 06:02.780
So how much time did you spend in Cambodia?

06:02.920 --> 06:04.822
Not a lot of time, about three weeks.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.748
So most of the effort was really directed from here, is that right?

06:12.310 --> 06:13.451
We had to get the money.

06:13.631 --> 06:14.452
We've always done this.

06:15.413 --> 06:16.474
We had to get the money.

06:16.974 --> 06:18.876
In other words, Cornell doesn't have money for that.

06:18.956 --> 06:21.538
Cornell doesn't have one of its own collections.

06:21.558 --> 06:25.761
It's a matter of writing the proposal, trying to get a foundation to give us money for it.

06:26.282 --> 06:30.005
And the first one, actually, was funded by the Christopher Reynolds Foundation.

06:32.667 --> 06:41.895
And we were able to... Basically, in a three-weeks project, you're really looking at...

06:43.192 --> 06:50.298
21 solid days, no breaks from really very early morning, from 5 a.m.

06:50.799 --> 06:57.004
really up to quite late in the evening because you really have to take advantage of every minute that you're there.

06:57.925 --> 07:01.709
And these people learn just incredibly fast.

07:01.729 --> 07:12.338
Their manual skills, their really excellent innate manual skills because so many more things there are made by hand now than there are in the West.

07:13.280 --> 07:25.358
So we were able to get the program going, provide them with materials and minor equipment, basically chart out the work that needed to be done.

07:25.378 --> 07:36.874
We put in place a graduate student to oversee the project, and then began the task of getting money for microtorming, particularly the two-slank archives.

07:37.575 --> 07:42.763
That's sort of important because when the Khmer Rouge came in, they

07:43.334 --> 07:49.583
took over, it was originally a Catholic high school, and used it as an interrogation center.

07:50.264 --> 07:57.975
And during the period of Khmer Rouge rule, some 35,000 people were killed there.

07:59.618 --> 08:03.764
And they were fairly meticulous.

08:03.864 --> 08:11.135
They kept records, which means very large numbers of records, which... Of these trascends?

08:12.176 --> 08:12.717
Confessions.

08:13.355 --> 08:20.624
Yeah, hundreds of confessions of sometimes hundreds for one person with thousands of confessions all told.

08:21.064 --> 08:24.809
Also, photographs of almost every person we went through.

08:25.249 --> 08:25.429
Wow.

08:25.730 --> 08:30.215
So what we were concerned about was— Those people were all killed, exceptionally.

08:30.235 --> 08:30.495
Oh, yeah.

08:31.216 --> 08:33.399
I think only two people ever came out of there alive.

08:34.120 --> 08:42.670
Yeah, and one of those was a person who had some skill of maintaining the generator, so he was left alive.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.900
Do you have copies of these records, of these confessions here?

08:46.401 --> 08:51.667
We are the only institution that does, because we were able to get... In the world, we're only anywhere.

08:51.687 --> 09:01.659
Yeah, we were able to get money, and it required an incredible amount of tenacity to film those materials, because we got a camera in there, we got a generator in there.

09:02.320 --> 09:09.248
We had great difficulty with getting government permission to film this material.

09:09.548 --> 09:12.792
At that time— American government or Cambodian government?

09:12.812 --> 09:13.473
Cambodian government.

09:13.493 --> 09:15.355
At that time it was called democratic Cambodian.

09:15.996 --> 09:18.799
There were no formal relationships with any Western nation.

09:20.001 --> 09:20.962
This is about when?

09:20.982 --> 09:26.689
This is dated 1990, so it's— That's when this article was written.

09:26.749 --> 09:32.135
The work that we did started in 1988, but the real project started in 1988.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.618
Is a lot of that included in here?

09:35.459 --> 09:37.001
So you discussed a lot of that in this article?

09:37.241 --> 09:38.543
Some of that.

09:39.248 --> 09:48.498
Part of the problem, as I said, at the time when we went there was that democratic Campuchia, the Khmer Rouge had been driven out by the Vietnamese.

09:49.559 --> 09:59.409
In other words, we had the misfortune to be rescued from the Khmer Rouge by the Vietnamese, and the United States and any other Western nations did not have relationships with.

09:59.429 --> 10:05.456
Consequently, it made Cambodia sort of a pariah.

10:06.176 --> 10:07.838
So the only

10:08.122 --> 10:16.770
The only embassies, the only consulates there were East Germany and Russia.

10:18.311 --> 10:23.016
And the only people working there were non-government organizations.

10:23.876 --> 10:28.761
Oxfam, UNICEF was there.

10:28.781 --> 10:36.508
It's the only United Nations organization that's allowed to work in places like that, environmental children with humanitarian efforts.

10:37.062 --> 10:38.985
So it's very, very difficult doing business.

10:40.106 --> 10:51.862
It's very difficult actually getting things out of here, over there, because almost everything that we did, everything, every piece of material that we wanted to send over there was regarded as strategic material by the U.S.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.444
government, by the state of Congress.

10:53.464 --> 10:54.766
It was real hard.

10:54.786 --> 10:56.628
Did you have to clear all of this material?

10:57.249 --> 11:00.593
We sent it in through Singapore.

11:00.914 --> 11:02.496
So you did not run it by...

11:05.564 --> 11:06.766
No.

11:06.986 --> 11:16.699
The, um... Well, this is kind of a paradoxical situation, isn't it?

11:16.739 --> 11:32.259
I mean, the material central to that, there's a lot of this cultural stuff that we're talking about, that is so essential to their own memory of themselves, is up here in Ithac and New York, right?

11:32.339 --> 11:33.681
And not in Cambodia.

11:33.813 --> 11:36.035
Did that strike you as a paradox?

11:36.956 --> 11:37.897
It's not unusual.

11:38.858 --> 11:46.206
Coronel Selections is stronger than a number of national libraries in Southeast Asia.

11:46.226 --> 11:54.615
The reason is that so many have been destroyed, not just through war, but through neglect, through insects, that environment.

11:56.336 --> 11:59.820
In fact, we've had a number of

12:00.391 --> 12:04.276
projects here to microfilm Southeast Asian materials, our own Southeast Asian materials.

12:05.097 --> 12:13.608
And we have automatically, at Cornell's expense, made copies of the film and sent them there in order for them to rebuild their collection.

12:13.949 --> 12:19.816
So we've been sending them materials in their own language in order to begin to rebuild the national bibliography.

12:19.836 --> 12:20.717
This is Cambodia.

12:21.178 --> 12:24.422
In Cambodia and Vietnam, the last... As well.

12:24.442 --> 12:26.225
Yes.

12:27.086 --> 12:29.269
In the case of Cambodia, it was difficult.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.330
The government...

12:31.458 --> 12:36.586
Um, the government was obviously a communist government.

12:36.606 --> 12:39.450
It was, um, well, theoretically a communist government.

12:39.470 --> 12:45.899
It was still fairly heavily, um, staffed by former Khairouge.

12:47.061 --> 12:51.828
There were a number of political reasons why they didn't want us to film the Teusling archives, but yet.

12:52.269 --> 12:57.837
So we had sent them the—we had given them the proposal, had given the Ministry of Education proposal,

12:58.441 --> 13:01.725
to film this material, because the material is very important.

13:01.965 --> 13:04.708
Filming the material here, or filming on this one?

13:04.929 --> 13:05.890
In Teosling.

13:06.250 --> 13:06.531
Okay.

13:06.551 --> 13:08.773
So what material is this that you're going to do?

13:08.793 --> 13:10.636
These are the archives.

13:10.656 --> 13:10.916
Oh, Teosling.

13:10.936 --> 13:15.021
In fact, I think there may be a photograph in here about these archives.

13:15.041 --> 13:27.756
Anyway, so filming the confessions and so forth in Teosling was

13:29.018 --> 13:32.281
difficult because we gave them a proposal to look at.

13:33.602 --> 13:34.903
They didn't disagree with it.

13:34.963 --> 13:40.548
They agreed with it sort of orally, but never gave us written permission to work on it.

13:41.228 --> 13:42.249
So we started anyway.

13:43.130 --> 13:57.042
And that was sort of difficult because we were filming this material, and soldiers would come about every week, and we'd go through this sort of elaborate charade.

13:58.223 --> 13:58.823
What are you doing?

13:59.579 --> 14:00.761
we're filming these materials.

14:01.221 --> 14:02.523
Do you have written permission?

14:02.683 --> 14:03.144
No, we don't.

14:03.945 --> 14:04.886
Well, then you must stop.

14:07.911 --> 14:10.674
Anyway, eventually we did get it filmed.

14:11.395 --> 14:13.198
And we have that film here.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.681
What kind of film?

14:15.822 --> 14:16.342
Max film.

14:16.362 --> 14:17.043
35 millimeter.

14:17.063 --> 14:20.248
So you're taking an exposure of each page that works.

14:20.268 --> 14:22.090
Yeah.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.713
So all of those confessions are here.

14:24.173 --> 14:27.458
Moreover, thanks to some work done by an Australian, David Hawk.

14:27.638 --> 14:28.960
So you've got all of them?

14:28.980 --> 14:29.080
Yeah.

14:29.549 --> 14:30.450
Well, all that there was.

14:31.031 --> 14:32.653
A lot had been destroyed.

14:32.673 --> 14:33.955
It was only fortuitous.

14:33.975 --> 14:38.381
There were about 8,000 actual out of the 35 that were saved.

14:39.263 --> 14:50.699
When the Vietnamese went in there, of course the Khmer Rouge got the hell out, but they tried to destroy as much of this stuff as they could.

14:52.241 --> 14:58.830
The 8,000 confessions are actually— Out of 35,000, there were 8,000 that survived.

15:01.223 --> 15:02.284
copies of those are here.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.006
Right.

15:04.046 --> 15:06.508
The 8,000 were actually stored in another building.

15:07.609 --> 15:09.050
It was sort of an overslaw building.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.412
That's the reason why they survived.

15:10.432 --> 15:12.694
It was just fortuitous when they survived.

15:17.138 --> 15:28.168
So filming that material was probably as important as anything else, because we had a strong influence that there was a good chance that that material might disappear, might just quietly disappear.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.169
Has it?

15:29.430 --> 15:30.130
You don't know?

15:30.150 --> 15:31.011
Not to my knowledge.

15:31.463 --> 15:35.310
But then again, things changed fairly significantly since then.

15:36.192 --> 15:41.181
One thing, the United Nations moved in there to sort of guarantee an election about three years ago.

15:42.784 --> 15:45.729
Who did you have doing photography?

15:45.749 --> 15:46.511
You sent your own people?

15:46.571 --> 15:47.352
You hired people?

15:47.733 --> 15:54.906
It was a graduate student from Cornell who was trained to work with Clear.

15:55.612 --> 15:57.355
stuff to film this material.

15:57.675 --> 15:59.838
Did you send the unexposed film back here?

15:59.878 --> 16:01.801
Did you process it over there?

16:01.821 --> 16:03.103
That was difficult.

16:03.684 --> 16:08.110
No, we couldn't process it over there, and that was really fairly complex.

16:08.230 --> 16:16.162
Generally, when you're filming stuff like this, quality control is very, very difficult, and it's really hard to have high-quality film.

16:17.483 --> 16:20.708
So what was happening was that as a reel was being shot,

16:21.397 --> 16:27.767
Remember, this is a country that has no connections with any other country, with any other Western country.

16:29.169 --> 16:36.401
So when the film was shot, it was taken out in the diplomatic by the International Red Cross to Bangkok.

16:37.382 --> 16:39.205
And then it was airmail here.

16:40.307 --> 16:45.255
We processed it immediately and then inspected the film.

16:45.916 --> 16:49.041
If there was anything wrong with it, then we would fax a message back

16:49.460 --> 16:56.210
to somebody in Bangkok who would give that message to the next person going out to Cambodia.

16:57.431 --> 16:58.913
Was it black and white, color?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.155
Yes, all black and white.

17:00.175 --> 17:00.796
Say again?

17:00.816 --> 17:01.898
All black and white?

17:01.918 --> 17:04.061
Yes, all black and white.

17:04.081 --> 17:05.743
With a flash or a tri-X?

17:06.424 --> 17:08.587
I'm just curious about the light.

17:08.848 --> 17:14.055
Well, with microfilm cameras, basically you have to— Oh, these are microfilm cameras, okay?

17:14.235 --> 17:14.315
Yes.

17:14.876 --> 17:18.201
You have to basically set it up for a controlled lighting.

17:18.603 --> 17:23.908
So you basically have usually four lights on a table.

17:24.248 --> 17:25.669
You have to exclude all other light.

17:26.550 --> 17:31.315
So quality control is really pretty crucial.

17:31.335 --> 17:32.596
You're concerned about resolution.

17:32.616 --> 17:37.240
You're concerned about the amount of light going onto the piece.

17:37.801 --> 17:39.382
And how many units did you have working?

17:39.782 --> 17:39.983
One.

17:40.383 --> 17:40.783
Just one?

17:41.044 --> 17:42.685
Right.

17:42.705 --> 17:44.947
So that took a long time.

17:44.967 --> 17:45.107
Right.

17:45.127 --> 17:45.808
It was a lot of work.

17:46.312 --> 17:47.634
But anyway, it got done.

17:47.654 --> 17:49.276
How much time do you think it took to do that project?

17:49.877 --> 17:55.945
It took about three times longer than it should have done because of constant interruptions, but I think all told it must have taken about four years.

17:56.645 --> 17:57.246
Four years?

17:57.286 --> 17:57.386
Yeah.

17:59.289 --> 18:01.632
And what was the scholarly imperative?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.294
What drove Cornell to do this?

18:04.756 --> 18:06.999
Well, there are two reasons.

18:07.079 --> 18:15.610
I think that, first of all, Cornell is the place where this information is on Southeast Asian materials.

18:16.349 --> 18:24.961
If any scholar expects to find this information, he would expect to find it here or now.

18:26.643 --> 18:30.148
But there's also another factor, certainly this is true in the training that we have done.

18:30.208 --> 18:38.060
There truly is a sort of a humanitarian motive as well.

18:38.841 --> 18:42.305
It is important for us to try to help other people.

18:43.587 --> 18:44.128
Moreover,

18:44.750 --> 19:01.993
One of the things that impresses me about area studies, it doesn't matter what part of the world it is, is that scholars, particularly in the United States, their contact, it doesn't matter whether it's Latin America or Asia or anywhere, their contact is with another person.

19:02.634 --> 19:07.961
It's not Cornell and some university someplace else that makes the deals.

19:08.341 --> 19:13.288
It's usually some guy who gets to know somebody there and all of the...

19:13.471 --> 19:16.035
quartered programs sort of flow from that.

19:18.779 --> 19:22.926
So as much as anything else, many of our programs have helped establish those contacts.

19:23.507 --> 19:36.868
Moreover, one of the things that certainly has brought home to me is that preserving these materials is the responsibility of scholarship worldwide.

19:37.849 --> 19:41.014
You can't put walls around what it is you do.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.663
your scholars need access to that material.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.046
And if it's not there, then they can't have access to it.

19:49.047 --> 19:53.931
We're not going to be able to pull out all of these palm leaf manuscripts, nor is it desirable that we do so.

19:54.612 --> 20:03.640
But in order for scholars to understand Southeast Asian culture, we've got to make sure that they preserve, even if it means helping promote programs there.

20:04.581 --> 20:10.326
Now, we've done an awful lot of this over the last several years.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.950
Not just in Cambodia, most recent.

20:13.570 --> 20:15.853
Cambodia is less of a problem now, as a matter of fact.

20:16.314 --> 20:19.077
The most serious problem right now is in Burma.

20:19.097 --> 20:21.299
Because again, you're looking at a priori nation.

20:22.140 --> 20:27.286
You're looking at very important collections, just deteriorating and disappearing at a very fast rate.

20:28.287 --> 20:29.349
Very, very difficult.

20:29.869 --> 20:37.478
Well, there are very few resources for the librarians and archivists in countries like that.

20:38.470 --> 20:51.548
You know, the destruction is—the kind of destruction is primarily the result of not enough resources being put into the collections.

20:54.692 --> 20:59.118
So it's really negligence is more than ballast, would you say?

20:59.899 --> 21:07.009
In countries like that, it's because you're looking at a very harsh environment, very high—

21:07.428 --> 21:18.343
very high temperatures, fluctuating but very high levels of relative humidity, really exacerbate the deterioration of this material.

21:19.585 --> 21:27.957
For some materials, and this is true of some paper, but particularly from these manuscripts, really extreme insect damage.

21:29.819 --> 21:35.427
And really trying to take care of that, trying to make sure that...

21:36.166 --> 21:40.890
The materials are protected from insects, which is basically one of the strategies that we employed in Cambodia.

21:41.411 --> 21:46.035
It was basically creating microenvironments for the materials that were not coming to insects.

21:46.536 --> 21:53.001
It would have been useless saying, well, what we need is an air-conditioned building here.

21:53.061 --> 21:59.167
I mean, there's not even running water at that time in the National Library, let alone air-conditioning.

21:59.628 --> 22:05.633
And in any collection that is used, killing insects doesn't do it, because the insects keep going back.

22:06.440 --> 22:29.553
In fact, a few years ago, a project we were working on in Vietnam, we found that in the National Archives, in one of the National Archives branches in Saigon, about 20% of the collection had been closed off, because it had been bond so many times with different chemicals that staff were getting liver cancer.

22:29.914 --> 22:33.038
And they just sort of locked it up and couldn't get at it.

22:33.507 --> 22:38.013
So, you know, there are very desperate problems in these countries in dealing with things like that.

22:38.033 --> 22:43.561
I mean, there are easy solutions to it, but they need to be trained and they need to be able to put things in place.

22:44.622 --> 22:51.472
Do you sense in these people a passion on their part to try and preserve these things?

22:51.552 --> 22:52.193
Oh, yes.

22:52.994 --> 22:54.456
Well, Cambodia is a good example.

22:55.137 --> 22:59.022
You're looking at a country, and I think there are parallels here.

22:59.122 --> 23:01.225
I understand you're interested in Bosnia in particular.

23:01.565 --> 23:02.687
There are real parallels here.

23:03.241 --> 23:09.951
You had a regime that set out to smash an entire culture, to destroy the culture.

23:11.514 --> 23:20.728
They killed almost all the librarians, almost all the archivists, most of the collections.

23:20.748 --> 23:21.689
In Cambodia?

23:21.709 --> 23:21.810
Yeah.

23:21.830 --> 23:22.330
Really?

23:22.350 --> 23:22.971
Deliberately?

23:22.991 --> 23:23.893
I mean, they were targeted.

23:24.253 --> 23:25.355
Oh, yeah.

23:25.395 --> 23:28.540
All educated people were.

23:29.228 --> 23:40.018
They destroyed many materials in the National Archives, destroyed a lot of the stuff in the National Library.

23:40.038 --> 23:43.802
Anybody that was a teacher, anybody that was educated was basically killed.

23:44.542 --> 23:50.928
So there you've got a society really leveled under those circumstances.

23:51.068 --> 23:52.510
Mindfully, too.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.471
This was the program.

23:54.491 --> 23:57.134
This is what they were doing.

23:58.255 --> 23:58.375
Right.

23:58.675 --> 24:02.419
Under those circumstances, how do you begin to rebuild?

24:03.180 --> 24:07.725
Nothing in your national library, very little national library.

24:07.745 --> 24:11.349
How do you start constructing even textbooks for primary schools?

24:12.030 --> 24:12.951
You don't have any teachers.

24:14.152 --> 24:18.296
How do people learn about history when materials come?

24:18.316 --> 24:19.398
It's very, very difficult.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.621
It's a very effective way of, as I say, destroying a culture.

24:22.641 --> 24:28.007
And I think I allude to that particularly in India, primarily because...

24:28.139 --> 24:30.101
It's quite perceptive in your properties.

24:30.121 --> 24:33.385
That is precisely the angle I'm trying to pursue here.

24:34.006 --> 24:34.427
Right.

24:35.648 --> 24:41.175
You know, I am looking at the books and libraries of the future, but, you know, the future involves me.

24:41.235 --> 24:43.818
I think you look at the last paragraph there.

24:43.938 --> 24:45.320
Okay.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.543
And, Kim, I don't have to read this out loud.

24:48.123 --> 24:48.744
Okay, Rebecca.

24:50.046 --> 24:57.555
Well, in each of the projects that we have done, we really have done a lot.

24:58.008 --> 25:03.074
I've basically been spending an average of about two months out of every year working at Southeast Asia.

25:03.855 --> 25:04.396
Your unit?

25:05.237 --> 25:05.517
Me.

25:05.717 --> 25:06.699
You personally?

25:08.140 --> 25:08.401
Yeah.

25:09.842 --> 25:15.469
In Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Burma particularly.

25:15.489 --> 25:19.154
And there are serious problems in those countries.

25:19.254 --> 25:20.655
Now who sets these things up?

25:20.675 --> 25:21.456
I do.

25:21.817 --> 25:21.957
You do?

25:22.696 --> 25:24.218
I get the money for it.

25:25.019 --> 25:29.404
Who are your counterparts?

25:30.606 --> 25:36.913
I contact them because I know them from previous trips.

25:41.639 --> 25:43.902
Basically what I've been trying to do is organize these people.

25:43.962 --> 25:52.112
About three years ago, I was looking for money to try to get these countries to cooperate with one another.

25:52.649 --> 26:01.921
It seemed to me that one of the big problems in many of these countries, and I think it's certainly true, and it's not limited to Southeast Asia.

26:02.962 --> 26:13.455
Part of the problem is in needs assessment, figuring out what it is they need, and then after they've done that, articulating that in terms of an actual program.

26:14.256 --> 26:19.342
Because if you're going to get money, you've got to make some sort of reasonable, persuasive case for getting it.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.386
There are a number of international foundations out there who really...

26:22.720 --> 26:26.684
you know, really not unwilling to support projects.

26:27.024 --> 26:31.148
Toyota Foundation, for example, has been very generous in Southeast Asia.

26:31.608 --> 26:47.863
So some of the things that, one of the things I've been particularly interested in is providing training at the same time, however, trying to bring many of these people to the point where they can articulate what the problems are, try to get the wrong money and try to develop the programs.

26:48.383 --> 26:52.727
So our objective, my objective three years ago in going to, in

26:53.264 --> 27:02.894
in trying to get funding to establish a center was to try to bring them together so that we'd be able to work with us to help solve the wrong problems.

27:02.914 --> 27:20.453
Anyway, I had very little support in the United States, primarily because there was, at that time it was not fashionable to fund Vietnamese institutions and so on, before normalization occurred.

27:20.669 --> 27:40.075
I was encouraged by the Nordic Institute for Research Studies, and I was invited there, gave a little talk, was able to talk to the foreign ministries in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway.

27:40.275 --> 27:49.427
Actually, the Dutch government came up with some money, and it allowed us to bring all of these people together in account of what we wound up with establishing the Swashen.

27:50.150 --> 27:55.817
to actually establish a center for the whole of Southeast Asia.

27:56.197 --> 28:06.810
The first part of that is a proposal that I've just written to go to the Henry Luce Foundation that will provide an internship program here at Cornell.

28:07.351 --> 28:09.213
So we can take two interns at a time.

28:10.995 --> 28:19.465
Two of them will be technicians basically training people to actually do things, and two of them will be administrators training people how to

28:20.086 --> 28:21.147
how to do the assessment.

28:21.788 --> 28:27.536
Now, when we talk about the headline of the story, The Preservation of Books and Manuscripts in Cambodia, I haven't had chance to read it yet.

28:29.278 --> 28:33.804
But it seems to me that your mission has several objectives.

28:33.865 --> 28:37.029
First of all, to teach these people how to preserve what they have.

28:38.210 --> 28:45.961
But also, it seems to me that you are helping them reseed and replicate the things that they lost.

28:46.061 --> 28:48.064
Is that a fair statement?

28:48.084 --> 28:49.806
To some extent.

28:50.545 --> 28:58.193
First off, it's really important for them to save what they've got, you know, to basically stop any further deterioration.

28:59.514 --> 29:20.316
I mean, in terms of, you know, in terms of access to new technology, I mean, the largest library, and it's a big library in Burma, for example, and Burma has not really gone through the same wars that Vietnam and Cambodia and Paris and those countries have come through.

29:20.566 --> 29:26.255
Things have been relatively stable in terms of wars with other countries concerned.

29:28.659 --> 29:34.689
In the whole of the Central University's libraries there, there are two computers.

29:35.851 --> 29:39.156
Those computers are not talked to anything.

29:39.216 --> 29:40.999
They're basically used to produce catalog cards.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.101
That's not unusual.

29:44.885 --> 29:46.708
I have...

29:47.718 --> 29:57.874
I am not at all hopeful that those libraries will ever, will be wired into the web, for example.

29:58.134 --> 30:03.382
It will be a very, very long time before that happens.

30:03.402 --> 30:08.450
I mean, getting typewriter reverence is a real major event for them.

30:08.570 --> 30:11.194
It's very, very difficult.

30:12.187 --> 30:16.271
Digital technologies are clearly a really important technology.

30:16.291 --> 30:23.119
It's going to provide us with an opportunity to make materials in libraries like Cornell broadly available.

30:24.100 --> 30:27.643
But a large part of the world is really going to be left out.

30:27.663 --> 30:40.557
Even with the Indian subcontinent, most countries in Southeast Asia, with the exception of Thailand, which is technologically streets ahead of anyone else, the chances of those people

30:41.026 --> 30:49.294
Gaining access to materials over the web is very, very slight.

30:49.895 --> 30:52.618
You know, meanwhile we've got to work with what we've got.

30:54.319 --> 30:59.405
We are trying to rebuild our collections, and at some point, clearly— With material from your collections?

30:59.505 --> 31:00.906
Yes.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.248
In what specific areas?

31:03.068 --> 31:05.391
Well, Southeast Asian literature, primarily.

31:06.452 --> 31:09.615
We've done a lot of social science stuff, but primarily Southeast Asian literature.

31:10.405 --> 31:16.615
You know, we filmed about 25,000 books in the United States.

31:16.635 --> 31:17.636
Of their literature?

31:18.618 --> 31:18.758
Yeah.

31:18.858 --> 31:21.643
Which effectively was destroyed in their own country.

31:22.043 --> 31:22.724
Oh, yeah.

31:22.744 --> 31:24.467
It doesn't exist in their own country.

31:24.487 --> 31:25.809
It doesn't exist in their country.

31:25.849 --> 31:32.600
Are there scholars over there who have expressed a need of this material?

31:32.620 --> 31:33.702
Oh, yeah.

31:33.722 --> 31:35.845
And how is it being replicated over there?

31:35.865 --> 31:38.269
You're not making physical copies of it?

31:38.452 --> 31:39.614
Or is it microfilm?

31:39.634 --> 31:44.482
It's film at the present time, and that in itself is a little cumbersome.

31:45.323 --> 31:53.096
One of the possible benefits of digital technology, and I don't look at an opportunity to see it.

31:53.116 --> 31:54.097
You'll get that tomorrow.

31:54.318 --> 31:55.339
I can't believe so.

31:55.580 --> 32:03.953
One of the advantages in digital imaging technology, which is basically what we're doing here, is the fact that

32:04.945 --> 32:10.911
You capture something, and having captured it, you have created a set of images that you can do a lot with.

32:10.931 --> 32:11.732
It's very flexible.

32:12.653 --> 32:19.761
Clearly, you can make those images available over the web and various other ways.

32:20.742 --> 32:33.535
More importantly, and I think this is perhaps where digital technology can have a real impact in South East Asia, more importantly, you can replicate a printed volume

32:33.869 --> 33:02.948
very very very very well at very high speed and at very low cost the Ducutech printer prints at the rate of 139 pages a minute and produces very very high quality facsimiles it seems to me that that it's as I said it's probably unrealistic to look at digital the electronic library in terms of those people receiving images

33:03.586 --> 33:09.335
But the ability to reproduce books from those images is, I think, very powerful.

33:10.197 --> 33:15.185
Moreover, obviously, we can produce them on very high-quality paper.

33:17.148 --> 33:23.859
And the nice thing about digital technology is that because it is digital technology, there's no generational problem.

33:24.039 --> 33:30.910
In other words, the millionth copy isn't a bit as good as the first copy because it's either a zero or a one.

33:32.223 --> 33:42.576
So I think that the real impact of digital technology on third world countries may well be in the production of printed copies.

33:43.858 --> 33:45.040
From digital?

33:45.060 --> 33:46.121
From digital images, yeah.

33:46.542 --> 33:49.986
It's either a zero or a one.

33:50.006 --> 33:50.226
Right.

33:50.527 --> 33:57.456
Anne is the associate director of this program here at Cornell, our program.

33:57.476 --> 34:00.660
And she basically is really one of the

34:00.877 --> 34:03.881
one of the most knowledgeable people in the world on digital technology.

34:04.422 --> 34:11.191
She's actually had an international committee on digital imaging for Apple materials.

34:11.211 --> 34:12.593
I think it's actually tomorrow morning.

34:12.613 --> 34:18.281
Yes, committee is tomorrow morning.

34:18.301 --> 34:28.735
So it is a very happy circumstance, isn't it, that you have this confluence of situations where I remember when Cornell has all this material.

34:28.755 --> 34:28.875
Right.

34:29.328 --> 34:32.752
And number two, you are the leader, apparently, in this technology.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.835
And it seems that you couldn't do, obviously, you couldn't do one without the other.

34:35.855 --> 34:35.975
Right.

34:36.796 --> 34:37.396
Yeah.

34:37.416 --> 34:41.400
And the other thing, too, is that, you know, it's like preserving collections here at Cornell.

34:42.602 --> 34:44.043
There is no one solution.

34:44.063 --> 34:47.507
We have to take a very broad approach to that.

34:47.647 --> 34:55.555
You know, people actually use materials, and, you know, they're actually taking books out of the library bringing them back again.

34:56.243 --> 35:02.712
There's a lot of artifactual value in a lot of the materials that we deal with.

35:02.732 --> 35:11.224
Moreover, you know, you're looking at in this library alone, and it's only the tenth largest library in the United States.

35:11.244 --> 35:13.667
This library, yeah?

35:13.687 --> 35:13.907
Yeah.

35:13.928 --> 35:15.650
You say only the tenth?

35:15.710 --> 35:17.553
Yeah, it's only the tenth largest in the country.

35:18.033 --> 35:18.494
Only?

35:19.015 --> 35:22.960
Yeah, but this library has around 7 million books, 70 million manuscripts.

35:23.311 --> 35:41.921
Now, under those circumstances, you know, this picture that people have of all these resources suddenly being out there, um, unavailable over the web, at least clearly it's extremely unrealistic.

35:42.562 --> 35:45.927
And we've been working at this for a long time now.

35:46.666 --> 35:52.371
You know, it's the nearest fraction of the collections that we have available over the networks.

35:52.391 --> 35:56.155
So somebody clearly, obviously, then is making a selection of things.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.717
Who's doing the prioritizations?

35:59.178 --> 36:03.642
Well, right now, all of the work that we do is grant-funded.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.704
Everything that we do, we have to get money to do.

36:05.724 --> 36:15.593
The university doesn't have money for us to do it, which means that most of the work that we've done has been done in the name of reception development.

36:16.467 --> 36:32.507
We basically have taken groups of materials to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technology, except for about six months ago when we began with support from the Mellon Foundation, the Making of America project.

36:32.527 --> 36:41.258
That's extremely important because most American historical material was produced during the period of the worst paper.

36:42.680 --> 36:45.343
Really bad paper began to be produced

36:45.897 --> 36:53.446
Oh, from about the end of the Civil War, which is basically when they discovered how to produce mechanical wood pulp.

36:53.466 --> 36:58.892
So, you know, the really crucial documents in American history date from after that time, most of them.

36:59.312 --> 37:01.795
Certainly most of them really wonderful publications.

37:02.216 --> 37:09.104
The history, for example, the history of the rebellion, which is a really important set, runs to about 150 volumes.

37:09.564 --> 37:12.527
Papers are so brittle that you turn the page and fall in bits.

37:13.328 --> 37:14.790
So...

37:15.428 --> 37:24.328
What we have is a support from the Mellon Foundation to work with the University of Michigan to begin the process of digitizing all of that material.

37:25.410 --> 37:30.180
Now, we automatically, when we digitize that stuff, make a new copy for our own collections.

37:31.163 --> 37:33.007
At the same time, getting this stuff out.

37:33.027 --> 37:33.748
A hard copy.

37:34.029 --> 37:34.129
Yeah.

37:35.881 --> 37:42.748
Well, you've got a digital copy, but in addition to a digital copy, you'll make a paper copy.

37:42.828 --> 37:43.789
Right, right.

37:43.809 --> 37:47.513
The paper copy is just a by-product of the digital image.

37:48.074 --> 37:50.076
But, you know, we're getting all these things out there.

37:50.096 --> 37:52.519
It's not to use the opportunity to make a paper copy.

37:52.719 --> 37:54.421
Right, right.

37:54.441 --> 38:04.251
Because we're actually replacing the Briffle book with one that's, in some cases, looks better, because when the paper begins to deteriorate, it tends to go darker.

38:04.602 --> 38:08.666
So what we're doing is producing a much crisper, fresher-looking book than the original.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.267
And these are copies that you own here?

38:11.448 --> 38:11.629
Yeah.

38:11.889 --> 38:17.374
And so are you preserving the pages as you go along as well, and deacidifying them?

38:17.394 --> 38:17.654
No.

38:18.295 --> 38:18.735
Twin amounts.

38:19.196 --> 38:20.197
So—I'm sorry, what?

38:20.397 --> 38:21.057
We're twinning them out.

38:21.898 --> 38:25.101
So once they're shot, they're gone.

38:25.221 --> 38:25.342
Right.

38:25.882 --> 38:34.390
Unless they're—well, I mean, most of this stuff is—I mean, it's not—you know, you've not got them doing Bibles, these things.

38:35.838 --> 38:48.573
There are some things, however, that do have fine illustrations, and in many cases the illustrations, because of the production process, is on a different paper than the text.

38:48.593 --> 38:55.181
So frequently they are able to save the original illustration and transfer them into a new text.

38:56.142 --> 39:01.508
We've done that on a couple of occasions where it's been a very fine engraving or a colored illustration, for example.

39:01.909 --> 39:03.651
You've been able to save the original illustration.

39:04.508 --> 39:07.031
Of course, you can't get that over the web.

39:07.051 --> 39:11.677
What you see is the illustration in a bitonal image.

39:12.718 --> 39:21.188
So, 7 million books and 70 million manuscript pages.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.930
And that's not all on campus, isn't it?

39:22.970 --> 39:24.332
There must be a book.

39:24.492 --> 39:25.773
Oh, yeah.

39:25.793 --> 39:27.916
So it's not an off-site facility.

39:28.056 --> 39:29.498
Yeah, there is one off-site facility.

39:29.698 --> 39:31.760
It's about two miles off campus.

39:31.820 --> 39:33.182
It's actually in the orchards here.

39:33.736 --> 39:35.758
And that's got about a million volumes in it.

39:37.441 --> 39:42.567
We're actually in the process of planning, they built within a year another annex facility.

39:42.767 --> 39:50.657
I've been to the Harvard one, which is one of the modules out there.

39:50.697 --> 39:54.842
Ours actually have been very similar to the new one, but very similar to the Harvard one.

39:54.862 --> 39:57.185
The Harvard Depository, which is huge.

39:57.205 --> 39:58.546
Yeah, very similar to that.

39:58.606 --> 40:01.089
Forklifts and everything is barcoded.

40:01.109 --> 40:02.511
There are even other titles.

40:02.812 --> 40:11.462
The new one that we will have will be almost exactly like that.

40:11.962 --> 40:14.345
The old one that we have is like a conventional library.

40:14.365 --> 40:15.767
Everything's crammed in.

40:16.688 --> 40:19.230
We also have a fairly large conservation facility up there.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.573
That's our paper conservation facility.

40:21.593 --> 40:25.758
With that facility we are concerned with graphic materials.

40:26.699 --> 40:32.245
Those are non-book materials such as photographs, works about on paper,

40:32.866 --> 40:36.693
maps, some flat manuscripts, things like that.

40:37.013 --> 40:42.302
Our conservation facilities here, in this building, are concerned primarily with books.

40:43.224 --> 40:51.258
What would you consider some of your more dramatic missions in Southeast Asia?

40:51.358 --> 40:58.570
If you could think specifically of some items where you mentioned those palm— Palmies, right.

41:07.983 --> 41:37.703
I don't think any it's difficult to think of any of any particular individual title because what we'd be concerned with as much as I think of this process it's it's working with the collections working with the people um showing them more than more than more important more important than anything else showing them that it's doable um showing them that it is possible to use local materials to convert local materials um to um

41:38.240 --> 41:41.183
to the service of conservation.

41:42.504 --> 41:44.406
But, you know, you don't have to be paralyzed.

41:44.426 --> 41:45.487
You really can do it.

41:46.328 --> 41:50.532
And, you know, generally, they're really wonderful people.

41:51.153 --> 41:52.214
Truly wonderful people.

41:52.855 --> 41:57.419
Do you feel sometimes that you're in a race against time or is there an urgency?

41:58.661 --> 41:58.841
Oh, sure.

41:58.861 --> 42:00.563
But that's true in the United States, too, you know.

42:00.643 --> 42:05.007
I mean, stuff's disappearing at a fairly rapid rate.

42:05.830 --> 42:26.669
Any materials that you have, by the way, that I can have copies of, you can help me.

42:26.689 --> 42:28.191
I love background material.

42:28.531 --> 42:28.951
I'm crazy.

42:29.032 --> 42:30.373
That's from the encyclopedia.

42:30.433 --> 42:31.534
Oh, that's important.

42:31.554 --> 42:31.654
Okay.

42:31.674 --> 42:32.635
Yeah.

42:32.655 --> 42:34.977
This is the offering for me.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.448
It has a nice colour.

42:37.508 --> 42:41.113
Those are my little fat hands with brittle paper.

42:41.313 --> 42:43.576
That's this article that I have here, right?

42:43.596 --> 42:44.797
Yeah, you can keep that.

42:44.817 --> 42:46.099
Thank you.

42:46.700 --> 42:54.790
The reason why that's useful, this one, is because it sort of gives a little bit of background about, you know, what the causes it to do.

42:55.231 --> 42:55.992
But there really is.

42:56.192 --> 42:59.736
And it was you saying that, race against time, that made me think of it.

43:00.217 --> 43:02.500
Because that particular illustration is,

43:02.969 --> 43:06.453
is designed to show that.

43:08.475 --> 43:10.117
This is the Britannica.

43:10.958 --> 43:17.985
So the work you do here at Cornell is probably among the most accomplished, I would say.

43:18.126 --> 43:22.590
It's state-of-the-art Time magazine.

43:22.610 --> 43:27.456
Yeah, there's another, there's something in here, I just remembered.

43:27.556 --> 43:32.301
There's actually an article coming out in

43:32.804 --> 43:41.416
In Libya, this is an international library journal in Zoom that describes some of the projects in Southeast Asia.

43:42.518 --> 43:44.320
I was looking for sort of a list of them.

43:44.340 --> 43:48.586
I couldn't point it.

43:48.686 --> 43:59.942
And I realized that this is my resume that I use for grants here, that the real list of the programs that we have done

44:00.682 --> 44:02.724
is actually listed here.

44:02.965 --> 44:04.366
Is that something I can have?

44:04.386 --> 44:10.793
Yeah, this is just—I pulled this off the computer now, because I was actually looking for something that would list the stuff here.

44:10.813 --> 44:12.195
I'd love to have that.

44:12.275 --> 44:13.877
I'll need that at some point anyway.

44:13.897 --> 44:15.078
Right, okay.

44:15.098 --> 44:22.126
Because this thing here, I say, sort of lists the things here.

44:22.306 --> 44:24.728
Great, I see it.

44:24.749 --> 44:25.730
So that might be useful.

44:26.871 --> 44:30.655
All these writers who believe everything is useful.

44:31.107 --> 44:31.387
Right.

44:31.568 --> 44:32.168
Oh, I know.

44:33.249 --> 44:37.274
Just to be able to put some numbers in sometimes, that's all the difference.

44:37.294 --> 44:40.557
So, tell me a little bit, I'm sure I'll get it here, your background.

44:41.038 --> 44:45.643
Is it in library work or is it in preservation?

44:47.785 --> 44:49.287
Tell me how you got to do this.

44:49.327 --> 44:51.289
Get into this?

44:51.309 --> 44:52.530
Yeah.

44:54.593 --> 44:57.756
What time is our next gig, by the way?

44:58.529 --> 45:05.017
I got a—I went a scholarship to the Royal College of Art when I was 10, and I was there until I was 15.

45:06.158 --> 45:13.386
And then at 15 I started my apprenticeship in book conservation, a six-year apprenticeship.

45:14.407 --> 45:17.371
And then I went to work at the Manchester Central Research Library.

45:18.372 --> 45:26.882
And then—

45:28.516 --> 45:32.620
I got myself a degree in management while I was working there.

45:33.902 --> 45:40.268
Then in 4066, I ran into a fellow who, from the United States, who wanted me to come over here.

45:41.249 --> 45:41.629
I did.

45:41.649 --> 45:51.079
I came over here as a consultant in Newbury Library in Chicago in 1960, and went to work with her for five years.

45:52.220 --> 45:53.882
Basically, again, training people.

45:54.267 --> 45:56.509
Let's try to establish a program.

45:56.749 --> 45:59.792
Because we really know training in the United States in book conservation.

46:00.433 --> 46:07.320
All our conservatives here, for example, all trained abroad, which is a real pity.

46:09.942 --> 46:20.052
And then after five years at the Newbury, I went to Johns Hopkins University, where I started a five-year apprenticeship program there, which weren't really that well.

46:21.013 --> 46:22.815
So I was there for 10 years when I came here.

46:22.835 --> 46:24.156
I'd been here for 11 years.

46:26.127 --> 46:31.374
Do you have a passion for books at all?

46:31.395 --> 46:33.477
A bibliophilic passion in any way?

46:33.498 --> 46:33.978
Yes, some books.

46:34.259 --> 46:36.161
Some books, yes.

46:36.181 --> 46:39.626
So I enjoy working with them.

46:39.646 --> 46:46.216
You see, as I said before, it's important that we move forward on a whole number of fronts.

46:46.296 --> 46:52.084
And for some materials, and this is true for materials generally published before 1850,

46:53.363 --> 46:58.970
It isn't just the textual information that's valuable to a scholar.

46:58.990 --> 47:07.681
The way the book is printed, the paper on which it's printed, the way it's bound, the materials used in its binding, the decoration of the binding, that's all information too.

47:08.782 --> 47:17.653
And so we put a great deal of effort into restoring materials to their original format so that scholars can use that information in their research.

47:18.974 --> 47:21.177
And clearly,

47:21.393 --> 47:23.776
That's stuff that can't be replicated.

47:24.137 --> 47:30.946
We can replicate the, you know, the textual information, but we can't replicate the physical evidence.

47:30.966 --> 47:35.833
Which, of course, is the whole essence of what digital, you know, what scanning does.

47:35.893 --> 47:44.485
It does replicate the information, but as a rule, I mean, although you do say that you can make precise cards in some instances.

47:44.505 --> 47:47.629
And for a lot of purposes, that's enough.

47:47.829 --> 47:48.430
Sure.

47:50.654 --> 47:51.475
I'll give you an example.

47:51.515 --> 48:05.537
When we began working on the Making of America project, we started with that very big set, as I mentioned, The History of the Rebellion, which is a real classic piece about the Civil War in the United States.

48:05.557 --> 48:07.219
But not a lot of libraries had that.

48:07.239 --> 48:14.010
It was a very expensive set to buy, and it's one that's in really quite poor condition.

48:15.412 --> 48:17.455
I think it's out of copyright.

48:18.599 --> 48:22.603
We didn't realize how this was being used.

48:23.324 --> 48:33.576
And during the last summer, we had a number of scholars from other institutions, in some case from another country, who had come to Cornell specifically to use that set.

48:34.136 --> 48:38.501
And they were complaining that we had pulled it off the shelf in order to digitize it.

48:38.521 --> 48:39.723
Otherwise, we wouldn't have known.

48:41.044 --> 48:42.926
But you see how powerful that is now.

48:43.227 --> 48:44.488
And basically, what we said to them,

48:44.924 --> 48:48.688
You know, we're sorry we've pulled this and we'll try to work around it with you.

48:49.248 --> 48:52.751
But, you know, you're not going to have to come to Cornell again to use this.

48:54.073 --> 48:57.776
You know, that really sort of brings it home to that kind of material.

48:58.457 --> 49:07.285
So how do you stand on this whole discussion of books and libraries of the future?

49:07.365 --> 49:14.172
I mean, do you see the printed text slowly disappearing from

49:14.928 --> 49:19.536
I think we will be able to do a lot of research that we can't do now.

49:20.617 --> 49:24.464
I think that we're going to be able to save a lot of time.

49:25.345 --> 49:27.569
We're going to be able to put together a lot of information.

49:31.615 --> 49:35.281
Obviously, this stuff's got to be up there for people to get to it.

49:36.764 --> 49:41.712
But I see a time where a person sitting in front of a computer...

49:42.265 --> 49:47.733
The communication is, you know, basically between yourself and the computer.

49:47.753 --> 49:56.264
And I don't know, let's say you're doing biographical research on somebody like, I don't know, some person.

49:56.284 --> 50:06.298
You're going to be able to pull up documents from, I don't know, the Illinois State Library.

50:07.679 --> 50:10.042
Look at manuscript materials about Lincoln.

50:10.143 --> 50:12.025
You're going to be able to pull Civil War documents out.

50:12.045 --> 50:15.831
You're going to be able to pull pieces of popular books up.

50:15.851 --> 50:17.954
You're going to be able to do all of that.

50:18.555 --> 50:21.139
And you don't know and you don't care where these things are.

50:21.379 --> 50:23.763
And there's correspondence, which could be everywhere.

50:24.363 --> 50:24.804
Yeah.

50:24.824 --> 50:32.956
So, I mean, you see, you know, the stuff from, some of it could be from Illinois, some of it could be from Virginia, some of it could be from some other country.

50:32.976 --> 50:37.062
But it doesn't matter because your communication is that thing free away from you.

50:37.700 --> 50:47.529
I think that's the power of the technology, that it allows you to pull that material together and to use it in a way that you couldn't really do that before.

50:47.809 --> 50:51.312
You could always do that, but you'd have to travel around a great deal.

50:52.133 --> 51:00.621
The problem, however, and this is going to be this way for a very long time, unfortunately, is that not everything's going to be there.

51:02.243 --> 51:04.324
Actually, you're saying none of it's going to be there?

51:04.344 --> 51:07.167
Not all of it's going to be there.

51:07.265 --> 51:18.575
You know, I teach at Syracuse University in a library school, and one of the students had done really quite a good research paper for me.

51:19.336 --> 51:29.765
And I talked it over with this young woman, and I said, you know, it's a really good paper, but you missed a couple of really quite important sources here that you really should look at.

51:29.785 --> 51:32.548
And she looked at me, she said, well, they weren't on the database.

51:33.809 --> 51:35.230
And I think that's going to be a real problem.

51:35.564 --> 51:39.108
that there is sort of a critical mass.

51:39.128 --> 51:49.840
You reach a point where you begin to leave traditional print behind and move onto a computer, and you're not going to get everything.

51:49.860 --> 51:51.742
We see that with catalogs, by the way.

51:51.762 --> 51:53.564
Oh, I absolutely believe that.

51:53.665 --> 51:58.931
I mean, when I'm doing my research, I do like Picard catalogs, because it is very scientific.

51:59.451 --> 52:03.336
It does allow you to discover things, which is why I like to browse the stacks.

52:03.356 --> 52:04.677
So more often than not,

52:05.399 --> 52:11.565
You know, the item that's right next to the one you're looking for is far more fascinating than one you wanted to get.

52:11.585 --> 52:14.348
Yeah, and that's why we put all the money into subject applications.

52:14.368 --> 52:14.989
Yeah, that's right.

52:15.009 --> 52:22.657
Yeah, but, you know, the thing that's interesting is that with library collections, again, it's sort of this balance here.

52:23.477 --> 52:32.807
At what point, when bibliographic records are being converted to machine-readable form, at what point do people not use a catalog?

52:33.108 --> 52:36.672
Is it when 60% of the collection's been converted or 70%?

52:37.393 --> 52:53.473
At some point, and we'll see this with students, graduate students, and faculty, at some point, they make that leap where they begin to, I'm sure they don't consciously believe that, that what's in the computer is what there is.

52:55.035 --> 52:56.797
And they're missing a hell of a lot, obviously.

52:56.837 --> 52:58.339
I hope that's not the case, yeah.

52:58.419 --> 52:59.340
Yeah, but you know what I mean?

52:59.460 --> 53:01.242
It's, and I, I,

53:02.909 --> 53:09.077
The sort of image is the sort of somebody doing research on Abraham Lincoln.

53:10.398 --> 53:17.627
What's available may well channel what's published.

53:17.727 --> 53:21.592
Not only what's published, but the scope of the research.

53:21.812 --> 53:21.953
Right.

53:22.453 --> 53:23.975
The quality of the research.

53:24.756 --> 53:25.477
Absolutely.

53:25.497 --> 53:32.005
Will be pretty much determined by what somebody decided was good enough to be scanned and what wasn't.

53:32.491 --> 53:34.053
You know, without making a deal.

53:34.113 --> 53:41.841
And that's what I'm concerned about, is that certain decisions, scholarly decisions, are being made by the person who holds the scanning plates.

53:42.301 --> 53:42.802
Right.

53:43.943 --> 53:49.109
So, I mean, it really needs common sense.

53:49.189 --> 54:00.000
I mean, you know, somebody at some point is going to say, well, you know, I'll get some valuable information, and this is one source of getting that information.

54:00.892 --> 54:16.172
And I think that that's the proper role for digital technology is, from our standpoint, from a preservation standpoint, it's a tremendously important and powerful tool in preserving collections and making them accessible.

54:16.192 --> 54:17.214
But it's not the only tool.

54:18.115 --> 54:27.928
Because, for example, we have, as I said, very large numbers of manuscripts here.

54:28.297 --> 54:40.251
Even if a manuscript were available over the web, it in no way validates the original manuscript because people interested in provenance.

54:40.271 --> 54:43.534
People interested in seeing that original manuscript.

54:43.815 --> 54:54.927
I was involved in a conference in September in England and the other conference was digitization and preservation.

54:56.169 --> 54:57.510
Many of the projects in

54:57.710 --> 55:00.834
in Britain, and this was in England and stuff.

55:00.854 --> 55:04.558
The other projects in Britain are actually CD projects.

55:05.399 --> 55:10.505
And they basically take very classic texts like Beowulf, for example.

55:10.646 --> 55:14.250
That wonderful copy of Beowulf in the British Library.

55:14.270 --> 55:15.732
Which I write about in my book.

55:15.752 --> 55:16.753
Right.

55:16.793 --> 55:17.314
The Cotton.

55:18.034 --> 55:19.456
Right, that's right.

55:19.556 --> 55:22.300
It exists solely because of a book collector.

55:22.600 --> 55:22.880
Right.

55:22.900 --> 55:24.502
Robert Cotton saved Beowulf.

55:24.522 --> 55:25.303
That's right.

55:25.323 --> 55:25.824
And there it is.

55:25.844 --> 55:26.805
And I think

55:27.207 --> 55:42.092
Well, it's a very good, fairly high-cost project, but it creates a CD of Bill Wolf, and the quality is very, very high.

55:42.112 --> 55:51.308
Now, the reason for the CD is to provide people—to provide broader access to the manuscript without actually handling the manuscript.

55:51.592 --> 55:55.036
Well, I don't think they allow you to handle that script.

55:55.116 --> 55:55.277
Right.

55:55.497 --> 55:56.418
Oh, yeah.

55:56.438 --> 55:57.019
It's in the case.

55:57.039 --> 55:59.121
If you make a good enough case, you could.

56:02.966 --> 56:15.141
Their argument is that by providing that image surrogate, it will allow the original to last significantly longer.

56:16.122 --> 56:20.147
No one anywhere is suggesting that that will ever be first the original.

56:20.549 --> 56:27.175
And I think that that probably applies to the vast majority of materials that we have in rare books and manuscripts.

56:27.235 --> 56:29.377
I don't know whether Mark took them in the vault or not.

56:29.417 --> 56:29.977
He did, yeah.

56:29.997 --> 56:30.258
He did.

56:30.478 --> 56:32.740
It's quite a less spectacular thing.

56:32.800 --> 56:37.744
I mean, you look at our French Revolution.

56:37.904 --> 56:43.009
We've basically just completed our preservation project on French Revolution.

56:43.029 --> 56:47.192
French Revolution collection here is not just about the Revolution.

56:47.212 --> 56:50.235
It is about the Revolution, but it's all materials published

56:50.671 --> 56:52.533
within the period of the revolution.

56:53.694 --> 57:09.352
It consists of about 45,000 books, 20,000 manuscripts, but it also includes all of Lafayette's manuscripts, all of his personal collections, all of Lafayette's manuscripts, all of his personal collections, and so on.

57:09.372 --> 57:15.960
I mean, even if that stuff were available digitally, it does not make the collections any less important.

57:16.721 --> 57:18.062
So I don't think, I don't

57:18.380 --> 57:20.943
I don't think it would change the use of that material.

57:21.124 --> 57:23.207
No, and I can't imagine that it would.

57:23.727 --> 57:27.112
Now, you mentioned the Beowulf, but is that available on a CD-ROM now?

57:27.152 --> 57:27.332
Yeah.

57:28.233 --> 57:31.297
See, I was on a quibus last year.

57:31.317 --> 57:33.621
There are a number of things you do.

57:33.821 --> 57:45.096
One of the things we're very strong on here, for example, is we're very strong on natural history, particularly on anthology.

57:45.650 --> 57:55.201
And one of the great bird illustrators, Louis Fuertes, was a faculty member here.

57:55.221 --> 58:00.287
So one of the things that we digitized was Fuertes' journal and all his paintings.

58:00.728 --> 58:03.030
I mean, very wonderful paintings.

58:03.050 --> 58:05.393
Now this is under your direction here?

58:05.874 --> 58:12.241
No, this was using photo CD technology in special collections and rare books here.

58:12.261 --> 58:13.783
Well, manuscripts and archives, actually.

58:14.202 --> 58:18.168
So here you've got the man's journal, the early part of the century.

58:19.210 --> 58:25.018
Many remote countries of the world, particularly Asia Minor and so on.

58:25.920 --> 58:32.630
So if you want, you can get a map of the world up, and you can see a line showing where he went.

58:33.451 --> 58:39.040
You can click anywhere on that line, and it will immediately show you the relevant page in his journal.

58:39.060 --> 58:39.841
We've got that here?

58:40.061 --> 58:40.322
Yeah.

58:40.342 --> 58:42.505
I can see this at some point probably tomorrow, though.

58:43.733 --> 58:48.640
On the page of that journal, if you see the name of a bird, you can click on that.

58:48.680 --> 58:51.224
You will immediately see his painting of that bird.

58:52.265 --> 58:58.054
Moreover, because of the Library of Natural Sound, you can click and you get the actual bird call of that bird.

58:58.835 --> 59:06.446
You can also click and see illustrations of that same bird by other artists like Audubon, Wilson, Gould.

59:06.767 --> 59:08.950
So a book is never going to do that.

59:08.990 --> 59:12.475
Well, you can do it, but it's more cumbersome, and you've got to have the book to do it.

59:12.674 --> 59:18.322
And, you know, very few people have autobons because you're looking at $50,000 a print.

59:19.263 --> 59:22.327
It's amazing.

59:22.768 --> 59:26.412
So, I mean, that's a really powerful teaching tool.

59:26.933 --> 59:38.108
And it's a very useful way to use the technology, a very useful way to navigate through complex documents.

59:38.510 --> 59:48.200
The nice thing about, incidentally, about doing by-told imaging of books and monographs here is that the book itself is a fairly well-ordered instrument.

59:48.220 --> 01:00:06.998
So basically, if you get to a book title and you go look at the title page and the table of contents and then move electronically to the index and browse the index and find out that the thing that you want is on that index, click on that index in exactly the same way you would if you were

01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:10.982
turning from the index to a page and get that same image up.

01:00:11.443 --> 01:00:18.351
I mean, that's the nice... I mean, this is essentially what we're able to do using books.

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:37.153
If we're doing things like periodicals, and certainly popular periodicals like Scientific American, for example, which we're doing now as part of Making America, the early 19th century ones, we're really having to create some fairly complex indexes so that people can navigate that stuff.

01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:53.657
But, um, ordering this material, organizing it, um, requires an immense amount of effort, otherwise you're going to have a whole bunch of random images out there that people can't.

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:56.200
Yeah, it really has to—it can't be haphazard.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:06.972
It has to—I know when San Francisco Library moved, uh, um, they took the opportunity to cull a lot of stuff, you know, which—which got a hell of a lot of hot water out there, you know.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:17.557
But it does give you an opportunity to really organize, I guess, in moving and digitizing.

01:01:17.577 --> 01:01:21.662
But it seems to me that Cornell has a pretty—strikes a pretty good balance.

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:28.871
I mean, you go to Stanford University, where they are really a wired program, you know.

01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:31.694
I mean, everything seems to be computer-oriented out there.

01:01:31.714 --> 01:01:34.798
Well, it is here to such an extent.

01:01:35.487 --> 01:01:37.770
Stanford do have a conservation operation.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.712
It's a fairly modest one.

01:01:41.274 --> 01:01:51.647
I think the major difference between what's going on at Stanford and what's going on here is that everything here has always been within the Department of Preservation.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:59.757
We like that because it really allows us to integrate the technology into what it is we're doing.

01:02:00.209 --> 01:02:03.092
Maybe you could just explain that a little bit.

01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:07.097
You say it's within the department of preservation.

01:02:07.497 --> 01:02:19.931
Well, one of the problems with digital technology, when you start making images, particularly of printed books available, you're really clearly running into potential copyright problems.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:29.322
Now, if you look at the stuff that we're preserving, for the most part, we're preserving materials that are out of copyright.

01:02:30.736 --> 01:02:33.143
So it's a comfortable match.

01:02:34.106 --> 01:02:37.255
These guys are preserving books because they're deteriorated.

01:02:38.158 --> 01:02:40.645
They're deteriorated in many cases because they're old.

01:02:41.528 --> 01:02:45.640
If they're all around a copyright, why not use digital imaging technology?
