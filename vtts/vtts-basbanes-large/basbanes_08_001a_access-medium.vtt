WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:04.009
I'll lead us into a question.

00:07.112 --> 00:17.703
On the eve of the 24th century and the relevance of poetry, if we just kind of enter a conversation, are that... Sure.

00:18.463 --> 00:24.249
The astonishing thing to me is the enormous growth in numbers in poetry in this country.

00:24.749 --> 00:29.734
You realize when I was in college, a pretty well-known poet, as far as poets were well-known,

00:30.237 --> 00:35.024
would be published in an initial edition of 1,000 copies, possibly 750.

00:36.285 --> 00:40.932
And if it's sold out in two or three years, a hundred times the publisher is reprinted mostly now.

00:41.913 --> 00:46.559
And an initial printing now is going to be a minimum of 4,000, really.

00:46.579 --> 00:51.726
And Jane Kenyon's otherwise, my late wife's book, was published in April.

00:52.167 --> 00:55.531
I'm sorry, I should have mentioned that.

00:55.572 --> 00:57.174
Published in April out of St.

00:57.194 --> 00:58.135
Paul, Minnesota.

00:58.823 --> 01:04.752
Grey Wolf Press in an edition of 7,500 copies, which sold out in a month.

01:05.193 --> 01:06.074
They reordered 6,000.

01:06.094 --> 01:08.117
3,000 are on order.

01:08.858 --> 01:11.642
That is 10,500 gone.

01:11.662 --> 01:14.747
Two months after publication.

01:15.849 --> 01:19.053
And I think it's going to go 2025 in the first year.

01:19.334 --> 01:19.955
Wow.

01:19.975 --> 01:20.716
I know a dozen.

01:21.177 --> 01:23.019
Where is it selling, basically?

01:23.039 --> 01:23.801
Do you know?

01:24.001 --> 01:24.802
I don't really know.

01:24.822 --> 01:26.805
I don't...

01:27.578 --> 01:31.564
People have been writing me that it's out of stock in Seattle, a lot of stock in Portland.

01:31.864 --> 01:39.715
And I went out to San Francisco, where they had five copies before I had only one.

01:39.735 --> 01:40.456
I had only one.

01:40.916 --> 01:42.539
And they went in about 30 seconds.

01:42.619 --> 01:43.820
It's such an amazing thing.

01:43.881 --> 01:46.164
But, you know, fresh air did an hour.

01:46.384 --> 01:53.354
And the fact of her relatively early death is really part of it.

01:53.814 --> 01:54.655
That's the story.

01:54.736 --> 01:55.797
The story of that, you know.

01:56.333 --> 02:08.426
And there had been an hour-long program of Bill Moyers, about the two of us, which brought her to people's attention the more she'd published five books.

02:08.566 --> 02:14.132
And they, you know, and they were reprinting and selling more than 10,000.

02:14.572 --> 02:21.439
You know, there are dozens of poets in this country who will routinely sell more than 10,000 copies of their books.

02:21.459 --> 02:22.240
That's news.

02:22.557 --> 02:24.039
Newspapers don't know it.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.345
I keep reading the same story about how nobody reads poetry anymore.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.327
That's not true.

02:29.347 --> 02:32.351
I did an interview with Moyers last summer when he did the book on poetry.

02:32.391 --> 02:37.458
In fact, prior to this interview, I read this segment again on you, which is some good stuff in there.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.206
You know, that whole thing that he did, poetry is exploding all over the United States.

02:43.226 --> 02:48.313
The poetry reading is the link, but that doesn't tell you why there's a poetry.

02:48.334 --> 02:48.434
Yeah.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.518
I mean, when I was in college again, I was in my reunion,

02:52.409 --> 02:55.874
Harvard had an end out front for poetry readings.

02:55.894 --> 02:59.819
But there were very few colleges or institutions that had poetry readings.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.861
Poetry readings were a rare, rare event.

03:02.502 --> 03:08.270
If you look through the biography of Ball Stevens or William Collins Williams, they read their poems once a year, once every two years.

03:09.071 --> 03:12.576
And now there are many of us who could easily read a hundred times a year.

03:12.676 --> 03:13.937
The drama does crazy.

03:14.338 --> 03:18.163
But there are many, many people who will read, say, 40 times a year, 30 times a year.

03:18.835 --> 03:20.216
And you get paid for it.

03:20.256 --> 03:23.340
I was going to say, it's possible for a poet now to make a living from that.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.100
Pretty much, yeah.

03:24.201 --> 03:25.942
Yeah, it depends on what you call a living.

03:26.543 --> 03:39.957
And my freelancing for 21 years now has been supported by children's books and essays and magazine writing, my journalism, interviewing people, like Bob Hoosie and Worcester.

03:40.958 --> 03:45.062
But a great leap, maybe 25%, by the poetry reading itself.

03:45.734 --> 03:51.784
And then less we saw by the, uh, less by the royalties from books and magazines and parable.

03:51.804 --> 03:53.171
Well, they're a hundred dollars.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.698
Well, I don't make any money in the syndicate.

03:54.965 --> 03:55.365
No.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.908
But it does get me in three million papers every year.

03:57.928 --> 03:58.769
Yeah, yeah.

03:58.789 --> 03:59.689
And that helps my book.

03:59.749 --> 04:02.312
My book is 60, you went into a fifth reading, 60 pounds.

04:02.412 --> 04:03.673
Oh, very good.

04:03.693 --> 04:05.515
For a $35 book, which is not bad.

04:06.155 --> 04:06.876
That's very good.

04:06.896 --> 04:11.340
But I have to believe that they read me every week in these cities.

04:11.561 --> 04:13.903
Absolutely.

04:14.183 --> 04:16.325
And the talks have been getting them written.

04:16.345 --> 04:18.127
All of a sudden, it's been a pretty nice source of income.

04:18.147 --> 04:18.787
Yeah.

04:18.807 --> 04:19.028
Good.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.190
You know, I'd like to get one a month, actually.

04:21.290 --> 04:21.630
Sure, sure.

04:22.184 --> 04:24.947
But anyway, poetry has kind of exploded.

04:25.067 --> 04:29.572
And first of all, I need to say two things back where I've said that.

04:30.013 --> 04:30.593
That's all true.

04:31.194 --> 04:41.125
But of course the quantity of poets, of books, of sales of books, of poetry readings, of magazines, does not mean it's good.

04:42.006 --> 04:43.468
I think a lot is good.

04:43.528 --> 04:48.073
I want to make it clear that when I'm talking about numbers, I'm talking about numbers.

04:49.049 --> 04:53.336
And the other thing, that there's a change in the audience.

04:54.057 --> 05:01.869
It is more apt to be a poetry audience, reading poetry, not a sort of general literary book reader audience.

05:01.889 --> 05:06.096
Now, the poetry audience has increased enormously in this country.

05:06.430 --> 05:10.234
But there are so many people who will read, who are readers.

05:10.354 --> 05:12.056
I mean, we know a lot of people.

05:12.076 --> 05:13.817
Most people are non-readers.

05:14.838 --> 05:17.261
But there will be readers who read nothing but novels.

05:17.281 --> 05:19.683
There will be readers who read nothing but science fiction.

05:19.703 --> 05:21.805
There will be readers who read virtually nothing but poetry.

05:22.606 --> 05:26.790
And this kind of vulcanization, I think, is negative.

05:27.251 --> 05:30.935
There are fewer general magazines that publish poetry.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.097
The Atlantic, Harper's, not Harper's.

05:33.117 --> 05:36.420
Harper's publishes occasionally, but that's no sign of it.

05:36.721 --> 05:37.943
They don't have an atmosphere.

05:37.963 --> 05:45.232
But obviously the Atlantic, and the New Yorker, and the Nation, and the New Republic, and then where?

05:46.494 --> 05:53.182
Whereas before there was a Saturday venue, there was Harper's, and there were other places that tended to do it.

05:53.262 --> 06:03.235
Harvard Magazine, which was the Alumni Magazine, became a general magazine, and is now becoming an Alumni Magazine again, has dropped a regular poetry feature from it.

06:03.873 --> 06:10.099
And I deplore this sort of separation into Balkans.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.242
But I think poetry thrives.

06:13.143 --> 06:14.384
Of course, it thrives.

06:14.404 --> 06:16.466
I think my question was the relevance of poetry.

06:16.726 --> 06:20.210
It thrives because people find it relevant, you know.

06:20.610 --> 06:20.891
It's right.

06:21.031 --> 06:23.894
Well, I mean, whether it's people being entertained by it.

06:24.374 --> 06:30.741
But, I mean, you as a poet, a distinguished poet, and I guess I'm thriving at

06:32.206 --> 06:48.472
you know, what the poet has to say, I guess it has... I feel that, I think there are more people reading it, and more people getting something from it, and one thing that they're getting from it, by and large, well, say two major things.

06:49.053 --> 06:58.247
One is an attention, an intimate attention to language, which is a zone, which one's counter to the information culture, but people

06:58.413 --> 07:26.192
uh overwhelmed by the information culture by numbers and figures and uh flat fat uh turns to something else which is uh has some juice to it and some something organic to it and parallel to that and somewhat similar is the quest for a test of feeling kind of litmus feeling for a litmus paper of emotion um feeling uh grief which is my major feeling in recent time uh i go to the poet's uh

07:26.476 --> 07:41.596
Not to be consoled in the sense of being told everything is all right, but in joining or feeling together, I can't stand the word share, and I'm trying to avoid it.

07:41.696 --> 07:46.543
Share is the most ridiculous word of the world at the moment.

07:46.623 --> 07:47.624
Especially for an artist, too.

07:47.644 --> 07:47.884
Yeah.

07:48.345 --> 07:51.249
But I go to something in the 17th century.

07:51.269 --> 07:55.234
I go to Gilgamesh, for God's sake, the oldest poem that survives.

07:55.703 --> 08:01.291
to feel company in grief, brotherhood in grief.

08:01.311 --> 08:24.445
And I think that for poetry by and large, either or both, and better both, enhances the reader by its attention to language and its accuracy, close use of language, and by mirroring and making possible and making artful

08:24.762 --> 08:26.824
the extremes of freedom.

08:26.844 --> 08:28.726
I'd like to say I read a lot of poetry.

08:29.426 --> 08:29.747
I don't.

08:30.728 --> 08:36.573
The nature of my work is that I read just to stay current with what I'm doing.

08:36.593 --> 08:48.685
But I have to say also how profoundly moved I was by this book of yours, and also how I read a ton of memoirs and autobiographies.

08:48.705 --> 08:54.550
I've learned as much about you, I think, through reading this book, and you have really

08:55.542 --> 09:05.771
Maybe you could have, you probably could have written a 60 or 70 or 80 or 90,000 word memoir, but I wonder if I'd have learned more about you, Heather, than I would of these.

09:05.791 --> 09:10.855
I have written a lot of memoir, and I've told some of the same stories twice, but you tell them in a different way.

09:11.816 --> 09:21.344
Yeah, but it is interesting that you did decide to, you chose to tell this story of your own life again in this fashion.

09:21.364 --> 09:24.447
Maybe we could talk a little bit about that.

09:24.487 --> 09:24.587
Sure.

09:25.613 --> 09:32.781
I didn't set out to write The Old Life Speaking now, not of the book as a whole, but of the poem.

09:32.801 --> 09:34.103
Of the poem, yeah.

09:34.203 --> 09:41.071
I did begin, of course, including the fourth poem as well, which is a question of a very recent book.

09:41.472 --> 09:53.005
I did literally begin by spending years deploring the sort of current, the poem of the moment, which is not quite the same as this.

09:53.457 --> 09:57.442
It's a short-lined pre-verse anecdote out of the life.

09:59.284 --> 10:04.149
This is the poem of our moment, which is always to be derived.

10:04.169 --> 10:08.715
And I spent a lot of time yelling at it, yelling about it, and so on.

10:08.735 --> 10:17.084
And I spent so much time yelling about it that literally I had the thought, if I'm talking so much about this, it must be I want to write some of these.

10:17.104 --> 10:21.169
And I experimentally wrote a few, not in the form that I eventually arrived at.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.564
and discovered, yes, I didn't want to tell stories out of my life.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.365
Okay, go ahead.

10:26.286 --> 10:31.633
And I don't think I've, I hope I haven't written the poems that I was deriding.

10:31.653 --> 10:33.616
No, I don't think anybody could describe.

10:33.977 --> 10:39.344
But these are actually in a kind of arcane form that nobody's ever going to see.

10:40.385 --> 10:41.567
But that pleased me.

10:41.907 --> 10:45.152
Every two lines adds up to 15 syllables.

10:45.172 --> 10:48.777
And I don't expect anybody ever to notice this.

10:48.797 --> 10:49.738
Is there a name for that form?

10:50.545 --> 10:54.490
It's a form of syllabics, and I invented this particular thing.

10:54.510 --> 11:00.857
Generally, in syllabics, you've got the number of syllables per line, but I wanted to disguise it further, so I took every two lines.

11:00.958 --> 11:04.422
So there's some sevens and eights, but there's some tens and fives.

11:04.642 --> 11:06.484
Do you want to name it?

11:06.524 --> 11:07.666
Syllabics.

11:07.806 --> 11:11.010
A subspecies of syllabics.

11:11.550 --> 11:12.692
I'll use it in the piece.

11:12.932 --> 11:16.136
If you want to give it a name, we'll christen it.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.038
I don't think I've got to give it a further name.

11:18.457 --> 11:20.660
But I've written more, actually.

11:20.821 --> 11:31.197
I had more in that same form in a book that I'm working on now that I'll probably delay for a couple of years, about Jane's illness and death.

11:31.217 --> 11:32.619
And why 15 syllables?

11:32.799 --> 11:33.119
No reason.

11:34.622 --> 11:37.747
I like the shapes I can make with it.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.589
I had written... You mean visual shapes?

11:39.609 --> 11:40.731
Yeah, visual shapes.

11:41.432 --> 11:46.540
I had written some poems in a long 15-syllable line before.

11:47.009 --> 11:51.355
The poem called The Thirteenth Ending is in a thirteenth syllable line.

11:51.415 --> 11:52.817
But there are some others.

11:53.558 --> 11:56.081
There's a long narrative I have in fifteen.

11:56.101 --> 12:04.012
And what I did, more or less, was to take that old fifteen syllable line and split it into two, but at any point.

12:04.773 --> 12:06.916
Not at a particular point.

12:06.936 --> 12:08.699
I mean, say, not always seven and eight.

12:08.779 --> 12:11.042
Seven and eight, or anything, but...

12:11.528 --> 12:14.531
I don't have any force.

12:14.591 --> 12:15.573
I should have known something.

12:15.593 --> 12:17.034
No, you shouldn't.

12:17.054 --> 12:17.995
It's not for you.

12:18.015 --> 12:21.579
You have read so perfectly, though, so smoothly.

12:23.281 --> 12:25.484
Does this kind of impinge on the creative process?

12:25.504 --> 12:26.825
No, it helps the creative process.

12:26.845 --> 12:27.726
It forces change.

12:28.507 --> 12:35.715
It is arbitrary, and I change one word that makes me change another one.

12:35.735 --> 12:38.278
Part of the process of revision, I revise endlessly.

12:38.680 --> 13:07.101
is to force yourself to think think over every single word again and again and again and this constraint constraints are liberation okay opposites are always the same constraint i'm sorry what are always the same opposites are always i don't want to label over any word on the tape that's all right yeah uh and so constraint is a constraint is a liberation and this uh syllabic uh form is one way i haven't forcing myself uh if i have the word become

13:07.418 --> 13:20.476
in the poem, and it's perfectly fine, to think it through and think if there's something better, especially, you know, if I change a word or a little one next to it, become, I no longer need two syllables there, I need one or I need three, perhaps, and I go over it again.

13:20.956 --> 13:24.881
Then if become is still the right word, I'll think some of the words until I get it the way I want it.

13:25.422 --> 13:29.768
One of the presuppositions is that you can always do it if you just keep at it long enough.

13:30.429 --> 13:36.497
But, again, you're forcing the number of syllables into the poem, in a way, aren't you?

13:36.815 --> 13:37.856
Theoretically.

13:37.896 --> 13:39.098
Becoming is the best word.

13:39.158 --> 13:39.999
It's the best word.

13:41.521 --> 13:45.585
I will do it so that it comes out the right number of syllables and I've got the best word.

13:45.766 --> 13:47.888
Then I will.

13:47.908 --> 13:52.414
I mean, people say they don't want to rhyme because it means they can't use the word they want.

13:52.434 --> 13:53.175
That's amateur.

13:54.136 --> 13:57.320
I mean, if you're going to rhyme, you get the right word and you rhyme it.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.000
No excuses.

13:59.322 --> 14:03.367
I love also to work things over and over and over.

14:03.387 --> 14:04.448
This is my great pleasure.

14:04.468 --> 14:05.269
I hate first draft.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.524
because I can't stand how bad they are.

14:08.544 --> 14:09.906
You hate reading them or you hate writing them?

14:10.366 --> 14:13.290
I hate writing them, and then I hate reading them the next day.

14:13.911 --> 14:15.313
And I start trying to make it better.

14:15.814 --> 14:20.901
And, you know, typically I work at least two years off in four units on poems.

14:20.921 --> 14:27.730
Well, I've read in that Moyer's interview that you spent as many as 15 and 16 and 17 years on poems.

14:28.587 --> 14:29.908
But that's exceptional.

14:29.928 --> 14:31.810
I'm trying to talk more average.

14:32.391 --> 14:38.096
Since Jane died, I've done nothing but write poems about her, and I began to write her letters.

14:38.297 --> 14:44.503
And there are seven of the letters, and the numbers of drafts at the moment from the early ones, about 120.

14:44.583 --> 14:45.344
I don't understand.

14:45.364 --> 14:49.328
You're writing her letters in verse, telling her what's happening, remembering things.

14:49.428 --> 14:50.609
Oh, you're writing letters to her?

14:50.869 --> 14:51.109
Yes.

14:51.309 --> 14:51.410
Okay.

14:52.150 --> 14:55.894
And some of them got 127 drafts, 104 drafts.

14:56.296 --> 15:04.265
The earliest one, which I began two months ago, was about 27, 29 drafts, and it's getting there.

15:04.285 --> 15:07.709
It was a draft 22 that I figured I got a form.

15:07.729 --> 15:08.470
Do you number these?

15:08.770 --> 15:09.631
Yeah, I number them.

15:09.651 --> 15:09.972
Right.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.174
I keep them all.

15:12.414 --> 15:14.056
Do you anticipate every question?

15:14.096 --> 15:17.660
You're making it very easy for me.

15:17.681 --> 15:22.546
I hadn't started numbering them until fairly recently, but I do keep all the old drafts.

15:22.566 --> 15:23.367
And I go back.

15:24.241 --> 15:33.028
You know, when I'm stuck or when I think the thing is finished, which I think from time to time, I go back and look at old things, things I crossed out.

15:33.669 --> 15:41.215
It's possible and occasionally I discover that on one day I crossed out a line or a word or a phrase that was really the right one.

15:41.235 --> 15:41.796
I'm in the state.

15:42.657 --> 15:47.240
And so I go back and I can tell where I'm at just because I've got the numbers.

15:47.461 --> 15:50.783
Can you imagine how much of this would be lost if you were doing this on a word processor?

15:51.504 --> 15:53.826
Well, yeah, unless you...

15:54.262 --> 15:56.324
Pat that out in a few minutes.

15:56.404 --> 15:58.146
I gather you don't do any of this stuff.

15:58.166 --> 15:58.666
No, I don't.

15:58.726 --> 15:59.507
I write longhand.

15:59.627 --> 16:04.331
I found my appropriate technology a number of years ago that suits me.

16:04.411 --> 16:05.993
And which is?

16:06.073 --> 16:08.235
Which is to write longhand.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.296
With a pen or a pencil or what?

16:10.357 --> 16:10.717
Either.

16:11.017 --> 16:12.318
Anything.

16:12.338 --> 16:16.182
The power moves from all writers and magic makers.

16:16.202 --> 16:22.007
The power moves from the number one pencil to the roll of ball to a casing to a thousand pen.

16:22.409 --> 16:25.073
because I hold it like this a long time, and it dries up.

16:27.216 --> 16:32.743
But then I dictate, and I have a typist for the word processor.

16:32.763 --> 16:44.760
So that makes it a lot more convenient when I'm working on a poem, 120 drafts, and I'm changing a period to a semicolon, and a word from the end of one line to the next, and taking out one word.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.446
Then she's going to type the whole thing up again, and I appreciate the word processor, but I don't touch it.

16:49.915 --> 16:55.562
Thirty-five years ago, I decided I stopped typing.

16:56.083 --> 16:56.663
My back hurt.

16:57.204 --> 16:57.705
I hated it.

16:57.725 --> 17:02.791
I think I was delaying some prose writing, not poetry, because I hated to type so much.

17:03.512 --> 17:06.376
And I hired somebody to type the manuscript at that time.

17:06.916 --> 17:13.244
And I dictate letters now, and I dictate all my prose and poetry.

17:13.885 --> 17:17.830
And then, because my handwriting is illegible, I dictate the revisions.

17:18.350 --> 17:28.863
Every day, I did my typist, the latest pile of revisions, and just go through and say, page two, would instead of seen, and so on.

17:29.023 --> 17:30.945
And I get back clean copy the same day.

17:31.486 --> 17:34.750
And the next morning, I have clean copy to work on it.

17:34.770 --> 17:40.316
You don't notice the difference from the dictation to the actual writing of it?

17:40.336 --> 17:45.943
Dictation is just a mechanical device to transfer it from handwriting to

17:46.177 --> 17:50.061
I'm sorry, you've written it, and then you dictate it.

17:50.301 --> 17:53.264
So you're not composing through dictation?

17:53.284 --> 17:54.005
I'm not composing.

17:54.065 --> 17:55.827
In letters, I compose through dictation.

17:56.227 --> 17:57.228
And I have tried it.

17:57.248 --> 18:02.674
You know, Henry James could dictate the Ambassadors, but I can't dictate a 500-word book or two.

18:03.014 --> 18:03.695
No, I don't know.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.216
People could, actually.

18:05.617 --> 18:09.941
But I have occasionally... I've dictated news stories on Deadline, and that's a bitch.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.683
That's the hardest thing in the world to do.

18:12.844 --> 18:13.905
You have to write in your head,

18:14.307 --> 18:17.332
And to have it be publishable within 15 minutes.

18:17.612 --> 18:23.341
Lots of times in letters I write perfectly fine prose, but if I sat down to write what I'm going to publish, ah, I'm just going to follow.

18:23.361 --> 18:26.726
So obviously the whole concept of completed work with you doesn't exist.

18:26.766 --> 18:27.587
No, no.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.290
People say, how do you know when a poem is finished?

18:29.610 --> 18:30.932
And I tell them, well, I don't.

18:31.233 --> 18:34.437
Because after a book comes out, I begin to make changes.

18:34.497 --> 18:43.510
But don't you feel that, I mean, obviously then you agree with Whitman who is constantly revising and leaves the grass up until we have the deathbed edition, you know.

18:44.271 --> 18:47.335
Do you feel that that's an appropriate thing for a poet?

18:47.355 --> 18:51.641
I think it's mine and I can do with it what the hell I wish.

18:51.661 --> 18:57.088
I also know that there are printed copies in libraries and if in the future anybody cares.

18:57.355 --> 18:59.237
and they like an earlier version more than you.

18:59.898 --> 19:05.665
But, I mean, this whole thing about certain poems reflecting certain stages of your development, uh, artistically.

19:05.705 --> 19:09.430
Well, it would be, uh, it has been hard, uh, to go.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.913
See, sometimes, Suzanne, a poem I wrote when I was 25.

19:12.594 --> 19:13.755
That's kind of what I'm asking.

19:13.855 --> 19:18.481
There's one word that just bothers me so damn much, I don't want to rethink the whole poem.

19:18.501 --> 19:22.806
And if I can do invisible mending, um, at the age of 60,

19:23.461 --> 19:30.290
and get a word in there, which is, you know, not a great word, but not offensive, I'll do it.

19:30.311 --> 19:32.474
Yes, it's hard to go back that far.

19:32.494 --> 19:41.186
But as you get older, and I don't know how much older I am, but quite a bit, you don't change so rapidly.

19:42.127 --> 19:52.962
And I don't want to go back and... If I... I'm wanting to make enormous changes, unless you probably would be to write a...

19:53.718 --> 20:02.491
But many times I find, despite a hundred drafts and so on, that I have goofed that I have done something stupid in there.

20:02.551 --> 20:06.516
And I can, if I can close it out, I can make the poem better.

20:06.536 --> 20:09.541
And that's my... How about during readings?

20:09.681 --> 20:10.923
Do you revise on the spot?

20:11.403 --> 20:13.506
I have every now and then, not lately.

20:13.566 --> 20:21.598
But I also, during readings, which is publishing, which is making public, I will discover that I come up to a word and I don't want to read it, you know.

20:21.832 --> 20:23.835
I would read it anyway, but I'll remember.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.437
There's something wrong in there.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.139
Will you mark it, or will you just mark it?

20:27.159 --> 20:28.281
I'll mark it at some point.

20:28.301 --> 20:30.443
Would you ever change it on the spot, if you thought of something wrong?

20:30.464 --> 20:31.004
Well, I have done.

20:31.865 --> 20:37.633
I found myself doing it, but by mistake, and once it tries purposefully, but I don't think for 20 years.

20:38.574 --> 20:42.419
But I had noticed that, and then, of course, I'd make a note and so on.

20:42.459 --> 20:48.868
And sometimes after a reading, I will immediately revise a poem.

20:49.253 --> 20:52.857
There's more to have to be true with management.

20:53.778 --> 20:58.183
When I first work on poems, I will not show them to anybody.

20:58.244 --> 21:00.146
I didn't show them to Jane for a long time.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.247
Jane didn't show them to me.

21:01.928 --> 21:07.935
For me, there's a point that it varies in time, from one month to six months or so, when I don't want anybody to see it.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.278
The poem is still changing on its own.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.640
Every time I look at it, I don't want to fiddle with it.

21:12.660 --> 21:19.108
And then when it gets set, I don't mean I know this is finished, this is just the way I want it, but I don't know what to do now.

21:19.493 --> 21:21.295
Then I will show it to others.

21:21.315 --> 21:23.438
Then I will read it aloud in the reading, perhaps.

21:23.978 --> 21:32.949
Knowing that it's not finished, but thinking it's okay, it's not terrible, and thinking that reading it aloud, I may learn about it.

21:33.730 --> 21:39.897
Sometimes people speak to me afterwards about a poem and tell me, read like this and didn't like that.

21:40.197 --> 21:46.665
But it's more that simply by the act of reading aloud the faces, I'm making it public, and that changes it.

21:47.303 --> 21:48.585
As when the poem comes in print.

21:48.605 --> 21:51.750
You know, I'll send the poem to a magazine and it'll come out a year later.

21:51.771 --> 21:55.938
And when the magazine arrives and I see it in print, it doesn't look like my typing.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.099
It objectifies it.

21:57.580 --> 22:00.906
I look at it again as if anew.

22:00.926 --> 22:02.188
And immediately.

22:02.248 --> 22:03.590
It is different, isn't it, in type?

22:03.671 --> 22:05.253
Immediately what I'm making.

22:05.874 --> 22:11.083
I mean, I know when you interview people, or I interview people, and they tell you something, and you quote them precisely.

22:11.772 --> 22:16.559
People who've never been quoted before say, I know I said it, but it doesn't look like that's what I said.

22:16.659 --> 22:18.882
I mean, they don't know.

22:18.902 --> 22:23.208
And there are times they'll say, you really want to say that to somebody, because I know what it's going to be.

22:23.228 --> 22:24.990
Feel free to say that to me.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.334
No, I've never embarrassed anybody, really.

22:27.434 --> 22:38.189
I've never had, I've never, I've done close to a thousand of these interviews over the last 20 years, and I've never had a problem with anybody who could.

22:39.130 --> 22:41.273
I'm very sensitive to...

22:41.472 --> 22:51.446
Anyway, you talked about living with grief, and obviously for a clear and understandable reason.

22:52.147 --> 22:57.694
Tell me about this book, then, if we could talk a little bit about this book.

22:57.715 --> 22:59.217
I began it.

22:59.377 --> 23:02.862
I mean, much of it was originally drafted before Jane McEwen Hill.

23:03.523 --> 23:07.688
Jane was diagnosed with leukemia in January of 1994.

23:08.209 --> 23:10.072
Thank God.

23:10.092 --> 23:10.332
15 months.

23:11.510 --> 23:19.580
She had acute, she would have died in two or three weeks if she had not had chemo.

23:19.600 --> 23:30.273
And she had lots and lots of chemo and eventually a bone marrow transplant, which was the only thing that might have served her life.

23:30.413 --> 23:32.075
An enormous amount of suffering.

23:32.095 --> 23:32.816
I took care of her.

23:32.836 --> 23:34.238
I was by her side all the time.

23:35.099 --> 23:36.641
I was by her side in the hospital.

23:36.661 --> 23:40.065
I got a motel room nearby, or out in Seattle.

23:40.501 --> 23:45.086
little apartment houses for the caregivers of the bone marrow transplant.

23:45.106 --> 23:45.987
She was in the hospital.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.971
I'd be with her from 6 in the morning until 7 or 8 at night.

23:48.991 --> 23:56.900
And when she was at our house or in the Seattle apartment, of course, I was just there 24 hours.

23:56.920 --> 24:02.647
I learned how to program pumps to infuse drugs and nutrition for her.

24:02.667 --> 24:08.854
I'm technophobic, and I never thought I could learn how to program a pump.

24:09.256 --> 24:14.162
and, you know, assemble all the tubing and get it into her.

24:14.182 --> 24:22.873
They dangle a heart catheter outside her, so you don't have to go on your skin all the time.

24:23.294 --> 24:28.460
I was rewriting this book and writing further poems all the time, she'd say.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.942
And I wrote a couple of stories.

24:30.022 --> 24:35.829
I just finished proofreading a story that's coming in Atlantic that I wrote entirely what she'd say.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.773
And she loved it, that when I was an actualian,

24:39.513 --> 24:41.615
you know, giving her pills and infusing, and I was under.

24:42.836 --> 24:49.142
And, of course, in the hospital, other people were doing that, so I just sat and wrote all the time, not all the time.

24:49.162 --> 24:57.270
I wrote, rewrote these poems over and over again, and wrote further poems about her illness, which will be in my next book.

24:58.471 --> 25:03.375
And I would, when she felt well enough, well, I would read aloud to her.

25:03.395 --> 25:05.017
She couldn't read much of the time.

25:05.037 --> 25:08.440
I would read, I used to read Hannah Jane's to her, and now I was reading that.

25:09.365 --> 25:11.587
I'll date Barrett.

25:12.688 --> 25:13.689
Why not?

25:13.729 --> 25:14.890
Under the circumstances.

25:14.910 --> 25:15.771
Yeah.

25:16.211 --> 25:17.392
But I also read her my poems.

25:17.812 --> 25:21.075
And when she felt well enough, she loved it.

25:21.375 --> 25:26.480
It was the old life, you know, that we were working together.

25:27.361 --> 25:28.782
And was this therapeutic for you?

25:28.802 --> 25:29.442
Did you see this?

25:29.462 --> 25:31.084
To write, absolutely, yes.

25:31.144 --> 25:34.507
It was all during her illness, and it has been afterwards.

25:34.767 --> 25:35.928
But it was helpful to her.

25:35.948 --> 25:38.190
If she couldn't write, at least somebody was writing.

25:38.575 --> 25:40.076
And she gave me advice.

25:42.038 --> 25:45.542
We only knew she would die for the last 11 days.

25:46.423 --> 25:49.626
On April 4, 1995, her blood counts were better.

25:49.686 --> 25:51.848
She was recovering.

25:51.868 --> 25:53.790
She was terribly sick.

25:53.810 --> 25:57.133
On April 11, the leukemia had returned, and she was going to die.

25:57.914 --> 25:58.534
And we went home.

25:58.875 --> 26:07.603
And the first thing we did after that day, the next morning, was to work on her postures for the one I've been speaking of otherwise.

26:08.765 --> 26:14.371
And the next, we worked a couple of hours, and the next day we worked an hour, and we finished it.

26:14.972 --> 26:17.674
That is, we didn't make any revisions in Poland.

26:17.694 --> 26:22.119
It was a matter of order and organizing, and what was in and what was out, and so on.

26:22.139 --> 26:23.941
And we wrote her obituary together.

26:24.381 --> 26:24.882
Really?

26:24.922 --> 26:25.162
Yeah.

26:26.023 --> 26:27.004
We planned the funeral.

26:27.124 --> 26:32.150
When we finished the obituary, she said, it was fun to work together.

26:32.170 --> 26:34.032
She wasn't just talking about obituary.

26:35.513 --> 26:37.115
And so I thought, okay, it's fun.

26:37.235 --> 26:38.316
I was at another point.

26:39.157 --> 26:44.244
And I think she'd heard it before, but I read it aloud to her.

26:44.264 --> 26:48.150
And she gave me a critical note.

26:48.591 --> 26:54.179
But I could see that she was straining terribly to talk and to think, and so I didn't do any more.

26:54.199 --> 26:59.366
But, I mean, I wrote that poem, and because she had just said it was fun to work with.

26:59.386 --> 26:59.867
So we did.

26:59.907 --> 27:01.249
So this is about this book.

27:01.269 --> 27:03.612
We worked together on this book.

27:04.199 --> 27:06.963
He saw it and read it from time to time, and so on.

27:07.003 --> 27:10.267
Not the book as in existence, but parts of it.

27:10.807 --> 27:15.994
And, of course, the old life itself is very episodic, so I showed it to her called my poem.

27:16.194 --> 27:21.341
And she couldn't read at the end anyway, but I would read her some things.

27:21.381 --> 27:30.072
Especially, I made sure I read all the things that included her, and some other things that were close to her.

27:30.406 --> 27:32.488
I read it without, you know, the final poem.

27:32.508 --> 27:34.751
I was just going to ask you if you'd read it back.

27:34.831 --> 27:37.694
That's a poem written out of illness, not out of death.

27:38.995 --> 27:45.543
Not especially hopeful, but it's in P.W., you know, the dumb review said it was about her death.

27:45.943 --> 27:49.968
It was about how it was to live with this disease for 15 months.

27:49.988 --> 27:54.412
Well, I probably began it about six months into the disease.

27:54.432 --> 28:00.379
And I'd never written a poem before that was sort of asymptactical and unpunctuated.

28:00.865 --> 28:04.410
I think the circumstances demanded it, though, actually.

28:04.470 --> 28:05.611
Yeah, I think it came.

28:05.692 --> 28:06.993
This poem came out of thoughts.

28:07.474 --> 28:09.377
Poems don't come out of thoughts.

28:11.079 --> 28:16.867
The year was without seasons, without compartments, without divisions.

28:16.887 --> 28:22.394
And then I thought without punctuation, and that, of course, brought me to the point where I picked up a piece of paper.

28:23.576 --> 28:29.224
I read it to her several times at different points in its career.

28:29.404 --> 28:30.265
And that one probably went.

28:30.599 --> 28:34.022
80, 90 times or something like that.

28:34.042 --> 28:35.063
80 or 90.

28:35.143 --> 28:36.004
So something like that.

28:36.084 --> 28:38.347
I don't think that one went over 100.

28:39.287 --> 28:42.751
I mean, once I had the idea, it was just a matter of getting the words right in the right order.

28:43.111 --> 28:47.075
I mean, the forms would have played itself out of it.

28:47.095 --> 28:48.236
It could have gone on forever.

28:48.256 --> 28:49.538
It could have been shorter.

28:50.198 --> 28:51.179
Curious.

28:51.459 --> 28:55.303
I read that on Terry Gross, excerpting from it.

28:55.323 --> 29:00.268
But every part of it, with minor exception, mirrors every other part.

29:00.738 --> 29:05.384
You just want to get as much of the world as you can get in without going too far and reading these things.

29:05.404 --> 29:06.145
But I read it to her.

29:06.886 --> 29:09.169
And she called me Perkins.

29:09.870 --> 29:10.331
Told you what?

29:10.551 --> 29:10.992
Perkins.

29:12.534 --> 29:13.916
And she said, Perkins, you've got it.

29:14.176 --> 29:14.537
That's it.

29:14.857 --> 29:15.378
You've got it.

29:16.259 --> 29:19.223
She wasn't meaning at that point, you've got a terrific poem.

29:19.403 --> 29:21.186
She meant, you've got, that's realism.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.769
That's what it's like.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.292
It was very much our disease.

29:26.353 --> 29:28.956
My cancers earlier were always our cancers.

29:29.543 --> 29:30.724
And this was our leukemia.

29:31.245 --> 29:32.086
We were very close.

29:32.106 --> 29:34.989
We had a 23-year marriage without children.

29:35.309 --> 29:37.532
I had children by an earlier marriage.

29:37.552 --> 29:51.988
But we were 20 years in the same house, two of us, all day, following the same ambition toward poetry.

29:52.088 --> 29:54.031
We didn't chatter a whole lot.

29:54.051 --> 29:57.154
We were both kind of, it was kind of a double solitude.

29:58.062 --> 30:04.430
And we got together to eat and to make love, and in the evening we'd chat a little bit, reading opposite each other.

30:05.631 --> 30:07.273
But it was intensely close.

30:07.293 --> 30:08.735
So when there were words, they mattered?

30:09.736 --> 30:12.420
Well, yeah, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't have much small talk.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.601
Cain didn't have much time.

30:13.801 --> 30:14.542
We had some, you know.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.725
We talk about the neighbors and the weather, but why not?

30:17.526 --> 30:22.652
You say here that you went out to dinner, uh, this, I was at the 20, out of the 24 SPF.

30:23.003 --> 30:25.527
There were those who didn't give it five weeks or something.

30:25.647 --> 30:26.849
Yeah, right, yeah.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.251
So much for the Jews.

30:28.311 --> 30:31.116
Well, we were, you know, we were 19 years old.

30:31.136 --> 30:33.560
I was 10 years older than my wife.

30:33.580 --> 30:34.802
And it made no difference at all.

30:35.763 --> 30:40.511
Except that, of course, the problem was that she was going to be a widow for trying five years.

30:40.531 --> 30:41.232
Isn't that something?

30:41.833 --> 30:42.674
Who can do that?

30:42.694 --> 30:44.156
Well, I had these dances, you know.

30:44.217 --> 30:48.303
Oh, I mean, it's... The dances weren't very good after the second one.

30:48.603 --> 30:50.226
And so far, I'm doing okay.

30:51.775 --> 30:55.639
Well, I mean, you got these things, but... I'm trying.

30:57.782 --> 31:03.669
You know, we haven't even talked about... I mean, you've done so much.

31:03.729 --> 31:04.730
I mean, children's books.

31:04.790 --> 31:07.173
I'm trying the children's books, too.

31:07.753 --> 31:11.978
I want to do a book about libraries through history for kids.

31:12.058 --> 31:14.661
Is that a nice idea?

31:15.029 --> 31:38.640
yeah well i'm going okay we're about to get into that

31:39.278 --> 31:47.734
Do you see the work as a corpus, as something that, when it's time, when there will be no more work from you?

31:48.675 --> 31:49.697
Well, not exactly.

31:49.717 --> 31:52.122
There are textbooks that you do.

31:52.202 --> 32:01.860
There's a textbook for freshman English called Writing Well, which would fit in in the, oh, Berber manual.

32:02.313 --> 32:13.268
The best part of that book is just about words one at a time, which is, of course, my material, whatever the hell I'm doing, and my obsession.

32:13.288 --> 32:17.513
But then there would be... Maybe everything would fit together in one way or another.

32:18.375 --> 32:23.181
Certainly the children's books and the poetry would fit together in many ways.

32:23.201 --> 32:25.865
They're written with an equal economy.

32:26.165 --> 32:29.890
And then the subject matter of a lot of the...

32:30.983 --> 32:35.969
poems, children's books, short stories, whatever, as a continuity and an overlap.

32:36.590 --> 32:37.291
So I suppose so.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.673
I don't think of myself this way.

32:38.693 --> 32:44.460
You know, you don't sort of plan what you'll do so that it'll be consistent with what you have done or anything.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.963
It just comes out of your character and your history.

32:47.644 --> 32:49.386
And your reading, too.

32:50.127 --> 32:53.611
My reading habits changed a lot about 15 years ago.

32:54.072 --> 32:55.273
I found history.

32:55.293 --> 32:57.396
I found history, but I finally did them.

32:57.967 --> 33:03.537
And then read all of Gibbon's sources and all the Greeks, and then began to read the... Did you read all of Gibbon's sources?

33:03.997 --> 33:05.019
Oh, no.

33:05.039 --> 33:08.806
They're not all in print, but... No, but that's, see, very early.

33:09.527 --> 33:10.949
I read a lot of Gibbon's sources.

33:10.970 --> 33:22.810
One of my chapters in my book, I was talking about the migration of books to North America, you know, and then, was it, which president was it who said, if we had a library that would just have Gibbon's, the books that Gibbon... Yeah.

33:23.279 --> 33:25.703
use, we have a very good library.

33:25.963 --> 33:33.235
And I've often wanted to go and actually look at the... No, you know, but I think that I've probably read five of these sorts.

33:33.255 --> 33:43.431
Yeah, but nevertheless, it's an awesome... I'm really interested, by the way, in what people, for my next book, what people, what writers and artists read

33:43.782 --> 33:46.184
how it does find its way into the end.

33:46.204 --> 33:47.806
I read some contemporary novels.

33:47.886 --> 33:49.308
I reread Henry James.

33:50.168 --> 33:51.710
Jane and I read a lot of things.

33:51.730 --> 33:52.751
You've mentioned James five times so far.

33:52.811 --> 33:57.075
Jane and I read him almost entirely.

33:57.856 --> 34:01.420
But we actually read The Ambassadors from beginning to end twice.

34:03.021 --> 34:04.243
And I read Ulysses a lot.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.445
You know, it's one of my favorite books ever.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.986
My piece on it?

34:08.187 --> 34:09.688
My assassination was history.

34:10.225 --> 34:14.189
has come into my children's book.

34:14.530 --> 34:20.236
And sometimes, you know, you have to sort of have this notion you have before looking at it to see.

34:20.557 --> 34:25.923
But there's, I just have a book, a children's book called When Willard Met Babe Ruth.

34:26.063 --> 34:31.229
It's absolutely full of social history of the teens, twenties, and thirties.

34:31.249 --> 34:34.292
Do you reflect what you're reading now or what you read?

34:34.930 --> 34:38.315
Well, that's what I've read over that.

34:38.355 --> 34:42.261
It reflects a historical attitude toward character.

34:42.281 --> 34:52.335
Yeah, because as you've said in the past, you know, you have no idea where this stuff comes from, I mean, in terms of how far back it's... Yes, and you have no idea what might turn out to be useful.

34:52.395 --> 34:57.142
When you're acquiring something, it'll turn it up somewhere 20 years ago or 50 years ago.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.567
Well, in the Moyers interview, you were talking about the apples on them.

35:00.867 --> 35:03.151
He said, geez, that's it.

35:03.251 --> 35:06.516
It's amazing.

35:06.676 --> 35:11.123
Something like that happened to me very recently when I realized the source of something.

35:11.223 --> 35:12.926
I can't remember what it was.

35:12.946 --> 35:13.607
There's no anecdotes.

35:13.627 --> 35:14.268
I can't remember what it was.

35:14.829 --> 35:15.810
But that'll happen.

35:16.611 --> 35:24.043
Poets revisit their old work more than novelists do, because they're always reading aloud.

35:24.063 --> 35:26.887
So I will read old things, and at least you shouldn't know about it.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.630
I've got to tell you a story.

35:29.015 --> 35:29.596
my A.S.

35:29.676 --> 35:31.718
Fyatt piece just this week.

35:33.079 --> 35:34.601
Maybe I'll even ask you this question.

35:34.621 --> 35:38.125
I asked her, who are you writing for when you're writing these huge books?

35:38.766 --> 35:39.987
And she said, well, that's interesting.

35:40.007 --> 35:43.491
She said, I'd like to think I'm writing for Henry James.

35:43.511 --> 35:44.131
I loved that.

35:44.151 --> 35:44.892
I used the quote.

35:44.952 --> 35:46.494
I ended my piece with that quote.

35:46.514 --> 35:48.876
She said, I think he'd understand what I'm trying to do.

35:49.057 --> 35:53.301
Now, that's a great, wonderful quote.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.263
And who are you writing for?

35:55.283 --> 35:57.005
I mean, I may as well ask you the question.

35:57.065 --> 35:58.126
It is an interesting question.

35:58.487 --> 35:58.667
Yeah.

35:58.968 --> 36:10.940
Sometimes, you know, people ask me in another way, a naïver way, which is, you know, when you are writing a poem, whom do you imagine as your audience?

36:10.960 --> 36:13.923
Well, I don't imagine my audience as your audience.

36:13.983 --> 36:23.693
But one thing I wanted to say that I think is really important is that I meet people who write poems, and they really are writing for themselves.

36:24.179 --> 36:30.345
And people will even say, oh, I can't change that because that's the way I felt when I first put it down, you know.

36:30.365 --> 36:33.167
And that is just being true to your own damn ego, you know.

36:34.228 --> 36:38.332
I want to write a beautiful thing that will last forever.

36:38.352 --> 36:40.874
I'm not telling you that I believe I will.

36:41.314 --> 36:42.175
But that's what I want.

36:42.275 --> 36:42.876
That's the goal.

36:43.016 --> 36:43.316
Sure.

36:44.157 --> 36:48.541
And a beautiful thing that will last forever is directed outward.

36:49.122 --> 36:51.203
It comes from you, but it goes elsewhere.

36:51.784 --> 36:53.005
There is...

36:54.082 --> 36:55.384
amused.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.008
That's probably just an evasive answer.

36:58.028 --> 37:06.783
But there is the possibility of getting through to somebody else the way the author, the old Gamache, gets through to me, or George Herbert, or Bishop King.

37:06.823 --> 37:09.888
That's a beautiful answer, and I'll use that in my new book, by the way.

37:09.908 --> 37:10.629
I'll tell you why.

37:11.130 --> 37:16.338
The title of my new book is Life Beyond Life, and it's from Milton in Arioppa Jericho, I guess.

37:16.359 --> 37:20.325
Well, what is a book that gives you, you know, the book's precious life, the

37:20.727 --> 37:22.289
life beyond life.

37:22.309 --> 37:24.472
And that's what the best writing is, isn't it?

37:24.772 --> 37:25.113
I guess.

37:25.553 --> 37:27.837
I want to write for Henry James, like A.S.

37:27.897 --> 37:28.718
Byatt, if you will.

37:29.238 --> 37:32.663
And in the sense that he is writing for me, he is addressing me.

37:33.244 --> 37:39.312
His self and character and knowledge is coming directly to me from his page.

37:39.332 --> 37:40.173
So that's my model.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.296
And therefore I want to do that.

37:42.817 --> 37:43.518
Not for anybody.

37:43.918 --> 37:44.679
Wonderful quote.

37:47.683 --> 37:48.304
Don't...

37:48.858 --> 37:50.900
Forgive me if I seem to be going too far afield.

37:50.920 --> 37:57.988
We are in Cambridge surrounded by all these computer companies and all this talk about books of the future.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.851
I'm going to get into that in my next book.

38:00.871 --> 38:02.773
I'm going to interview George Steiner.

38:02.893 --> 38:04.495
Oh, yeah.

38:04.515 --> 38:05.476
He really writes.

38:05.676 --> 38:08.018
He says, I go back to the Bible.

38:08.038 --> 38:16.047
I mean, not for religious purposes, but for religious lighting and how resident our books through generations.

38:16.921 --> 38:29.919
I don't know if this is a question or not, but I am really wondering if you have any thoughts about books, between hardcovers, and does it bother you that all this talk about books being on computer screens?

38:30.479 --> 38:31.581
I don't have a computer.

38:32.923 --> 38:35.065
But books being published, I imagine.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.869
A lot of people call me, you know, for quotes for C.B.

38:37.929 --> 38:45.139
Robbins and so on, and they're going to really do Robert Frost so that you can, you know, I don't know,

38:45.980 --> 38:49.223
plunge on the word birch and have to see a picture of the birches and so on.

38:50.504 --> 38:55.628
It's the confusion of literature and information, essentially.

38:55.769 --> 38:56.769
That confusion.

38:56.870 --> 39:01.734
And it's a basic confusion of our age, the confusion of everything with information.

39:01.894 --> 39:15.666
And the experience of reading a poem, hearing it, reading it on the page, I suppose reading it off the screen, I don't know why, is not the experience of information, but the experience of

39:16.490 --> 39:25.180
Reading an embodiment that bodies itself in your body and changes you, returns you, it's not reducible, it's not translatable.

39:25.200 --> 39:33.829
The notion of information has a notion of equivalence, that a paraphrase or a translation is the same thing as the original.

39:33.849 --> 39:40.637
It has that, I mean, no one would actually defend that saying a translation is the same as the original, but they act as it.

39:40.817 --> 39:42.098
They feel that way increasingly.

39:42.138 --> 39:43.780
All sorts of people who want to know better,

39:44.215 --> 39:49.484
The poem is itself and nothing else but the poem, and the poem is its total impingement upon you.

39:49.524 --> 39:55.794
And the more you can read it and the more deeply you can read into it, the more it impinges on you and comes inside you.

39:55.814 --> 40:09.717
And it is by means of its language and its cadences and its vowels and the, oh, originality and tellingness of its images, or we could go on listing forever.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.452
But it is not one of those things.

40:11.572 --> 40:13.254
It's not reducible to those things.

40:13.434 --> 40:14.755
It's the whole thing.

40:14.775 --> 40:17.138
It's like looking at an abstract painting.

40:18.059 --> 40:18.960
I say that.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.581
It should be like looking at a portrait.

40:20.621 --> 40:24.926
But when we look at a portrait, the first thing we see is a person and a character.

40:24.946 --> 40:34.817
And then maybe later if we look at it, we see brushstrokes and the rhyming of colors and the distance of colors and so on.

40:34.837 --> 40:36.899
And the point is all those things.

40:36.959 --> 40:38.100
It is usually also a portrait.

40:38.688 --> 40:40.410
with people, as it were, for a story.

40:40.870 --> 40:41.891
But, uh, not always.

40:42.431 --> 40:50.159
But, uh, if we do not, uh, take in the brushstrokes, the vowels, and so on, we are not reading a poem.

40:50.179 --> 40:54.342
We're, we're looking for a story we can repeat.

40:54.362 --> 40:56.544
I just want to, uh, I wanted to go see it.

40:56.564 --> 41:01.989
It was a brand new library in New York, from New York Public Library, the Sybil, S-I-B-L Library.

41:02.230 --> 41:03.090
Hundred million dollars.

41:03.831 --> 41:08.155
They were on the 34th and, uh, right near the Morgan Library.

41:09.063 --> 41:12.386
And there are some books, but they're really decorations.

41:12.406 --> 41:15.469
This library is strictly computer terminals and docs.

41:15.529 --> 41:25.198
And I've just learned that there's a brand new college that the California system was just built in Monterey, California, that was built without a library.

41:25.218 --> 41:25.718
Can I do it?

41:25.979 --> 41:29.422
Of course, it's sciences and... I feel about books the way you feel about books.

41:29.482 --> 41:30.523
I'm writing about this.

41:30.563 --> 41:31.924
Yeah, but I want to write about this.

41:32.044 --> 41:35.948
I mean, can you imagine across school,

41:36.620 --> 41:48.836
The head librarian, I got this quote, I'm going to confront the guy with this, of Stanford University that said, quote, the future, if you can't plug it in, I'm not interested in it.

41:48.856 --> 41:50.218
That record is happening soon.

41:50.238 --> 41:53.703
Stanford, the Harvard of the West, allegedly.

41:53.783 --> 41:57.768
You don't have a library, you have an information resource center.

41:57.788 --> 42:04.517
And information, as you so eloquently pointed out, is data, which computers do a very good job of, but data and information,

42:04.818 --> 42:14.093
And that wisdom, then, that knowledge, which we don't read in a coherent... We don't reduce money to information, nor... Do you think in imagery?

42:15.134 --> 42:15.876
Oh, sure.

42:15.896 --> 42:17.318
Yeah, yeah.

42:17.338 --> 42:21.224
I think in pictures and stories a lot.

42:21.244 --> 42:21.845
And language.

42:21.865 --> 42:25.451
But I think in dialogue a great deal, too.

42:25.912 --> 42:27.735
Immensely.

42:27.955 --> 42:31.180
But it's dramatic and active.

42:31.885 --> 42:37.733
And there is something in me, I think, when while I wake, that is always dreaming.

42:37.753 --> 42:56.700
And like nightly, and sometimes that bubbles up to the surface, too, with sometimes nightmarish action in a picture of color, which has something to tell me.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.205
Do you wake up in the morning at all with solutions to problems?

43:00.775 --> 43:02.577
Sometimes in problems in poems.

43:03.198 --> 43:04.961
That's what I mean, basically.

43:05.081 --> 43:17.317
I've worked by getting up usually about five and reading a paper with coffee and breakfast to wake up, and then getting to the desk is the first thing I do.

43:17.337 --> 43:21.923
It's the reason I want to wake up now to change it.

43:21.944 --> 43:26.670
And now I go and fiddle with poems about that.

43:27.952 --> 43:28.993
But my...

43:31.235 --> 43:48.196
I feel clearest, clearest, and also most critical of myself early in the morning, as to that.

43:48.397 --> 43:52.822
And I already, you know, I'll begin a poem or revise a poem any time.

43:52.842 --> 43:57.428
It strikes me any time of day and night, but the regular daily work is a big poem.

43:57.543 --> 43:59.385
I can't follow tapes at night.

43:59.665 --> 44:06.012
Then I can write prose later in the day.

44:06.032 --> 44:21.407
I remember when Elon Musk's letters and his journal came out, and I forget which one, but the letters were very nicely done, and the journal was a mess, and they figured, well, he did one in the morning when he was sober, and clear-headed him to do the other at night when he was drunk, you know?

44:21.467 --> 44:23.449
That means you could see it throughout the whole body of

44:23.885 --> 44:28.251
I forget what it was, the Journal of the Letters, which was written quite a few years ago.

44:28.591 --> 44:31.896
We only talked about baseball or going back to the home in New Hampshire.

44:31.916 --> 44:36.301
I mean, you talk about, I mean, was this a place to go back to, or was it, I mean, tell me about this.

44:37.563 --> 44:49.679
When I was growing up in the suburbs of Connecticut, I hated it, and I longed to get to New Hampshire in the summer, the same place where I live now, where I'd be hanging with my grandfather.

44:49.699 --> 44:50.500
I mean, the same home.

44:50.783 --> 44:52.105
Literally, yeah.

44:52.305 --> 44:54.589
I lived where my grandmother was born as well as my mother.

44:54.669 --> 44:57.313
1803, I read some places how the house was built.

44:57.353 --> 44:58.635
But the house was built then.

44:58.695 --> 45:01.720
My family moved in 1865.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.541
It was still 130 years.

45:03.222 --> 45:04.123
Continuous since then.

45:04.724 --> 45:07.669
But I loved my grandfather and grandmother and the old people.

45:07.849 --> 45:10.833
I didn't really like kids very much.

45:10.853 --> 45:16.622
And I thought, you know, from the age of 12 or 13 or something, well, I'll be the writer and I'll live up here.

45:16.906 --> 45:20.010
not in this house, because that would involve killing off my grandparents.

45:20.030 --> 45:21.952
I didn't want to think that, but that's where I wanted to live.

45:22.793 --> 45:29.200
And I've been, you know, various childhood sorts of how I've made my living, which is mostly about writing novels or something.

45:29.521 --> 45:34.887
And then when I was, say, college age, I knew better.

45:34.927 --> 45:45.259
And I began to think of teaching for a living while I wrote poetry, but maybe being able to get back to New Hampshire

45:45.391 --> 45:46.592
lived there some and so on.

45:46.652 --> 45:52.318
And in my first marriage, my wife did not want to live in the country, did not want to live in New Hampshire.

45:52.358 --> 45:55.662
And I didn't think I ever could, so I didn't, that wasn't any quarrel between us.

45:56.122 --> 45:57.604
But I kind of gave up on it.

45:57.624 --> 45:59.766
And then there was divorce and five years.

45:59.826 --> 46:02.129
I was single for five years, and I married Jane.

46:02.629 --> 46:08.035
Same thing from Ann Arbor, but it was the outskirts, and she grew up opposite a working farm.

46:08.055 --> 46:13.761
And she adored New England, which she'd hardly seen, and she loved the farm itself, which I took to after we were married.

46:14.517 --> 46:23.407
And we, I expected to keep on teaching in Ann Arbor, but we were looking, maybe living in a farm outside Ann Arbor.

46:24.228 --> 46:29.554
And then one day James said, it was ridiculous to buy a farm here when it was New Hampshire.

46:29.954 --> 46:33.498
Well, that made no logical sense, since I couldn't move to my classes.

46:33.518 --> 46:39.445
But it began us thinking about getting this place.

46:40.775 --> 46:43.698
uh, 94, 95, turning senile.

46:43.718 --> 46:47.362
She had to leave the place in order to support her in the old folks' home.

46:47.382 --> 46:49.484
They were going to take a mortgage on the farm.

46:50.065 --> 46:53.829
We had it, uh, surveyed first time since 1865.

46:54.469 --> 47:04.420
Got a price on it, and I found out that I could, uh, give a, give them a lump sum now, like a mortgage, and it would turn into down payment labor, and move her on the way.

47:05.463 --> 47:08.326
In the 1970s, who was them?

47:08.527 --> 47:09.568
Are these your family members?

47:09.608 --> 47:10.048
Yes, right.

47:10.069 --> 47:17.237
My mother and her two sisters and two of the three did not have enough money to save us for realhood.

47:17.257 --> 47:20.801
So having a little money from the farm, I mean, I bought it.

47:20.821 --> 47:23.525
I didn't inherit it.

47:23.745 --> 47:27.029
Having a little money from the sale of the farm was essential.

47:27.890 --> 47:33.917
And I had written a textbook which was called Writing Well, which was the first thing I had.

47:34.555 --> 47:38.581
I never did that make any money.

47:38.782 --> 47:39.743
Well, you know.

47:39.783 --> 47:40.184
Profile.

47:40.204 --> 47:40.664
Pardon?

47:41.185 --> 47:42.487
What year was it?

47:42.648 --> 47:43.789
Late eight?

47:43.930 --> 47:44.310
Maybe 1972.

47:44.490 --> 47:49.098
You know, I'd sold a profile to the New Yorker for 40 rand.

47:49.118 --> 47:49.959
40 rand?

47:50.339 --> 47:51.181
Yeah.

47:51.201 --> 47:51.581
Way back.

47:52.122 --> 47:53.004
That's pretty good.

47:53.104 --> 47:56.689
It was a 40,000-word profile of Henry Moore.

47:56.729 --> 47:57.290
That's fair.

47:57.310 --> 47:57.811
That's fair.

47:58.031 --> 47:58.692
That's fair.

47:58.813 --> 48:01.677
And then...

48:02.129 --> 48:09.078
We decided to take a year's leave without pay and to camp in the house and go see my grandmother in the old folks home.

48:09.819 --> 48:21.594
But when we arrived with our U-Haul with television set and a couple of things, my grandmother took her turn for the worse, and I sat holding her hand while she died.

48:21.614 --> 48:31.647
And it's as if, and possibly, that she was able to let go because the house was very important to her and giving the family was.

48:31.863 --> 48:32.804
I was there to take over.

48:32.844 --> 48:41.518
Well, we planned to spend just a year, but after two months, Jane said, I'll chain myself in the root cellar.

48:42.239 --> 48:42.840
I won't go back.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.784
You know, I felt the same way.

48:46.385 --> 48:49.770
We wanted to stay there, but I didn't know how the hell I was going to make a living.

48:49.987 --> 48:52.850
beginning to make some money, but I didn't know how it would next year.

48:52.870 --> 48:54.192
You know about freelancing.

48:54.212 --> 48:55.293
I know.

48:55.313 --> 48:57.916
A good week is only good this week.

48:57.936 --> 48:58.396
Yeah.

48:58.697 --> 49:05.244
And, you know, I've been all these years on the TED, you know, with medical insurance and everything, all that stuff.

49:05.264 --> 49:05.764
It was scary.

49:06.005 --> 49:06.405
I know.

49:07.366 --> 49:11.370
But the passion to stay there and to write all the time.

49:11.391 --> 49:15.195
The place to live was the first thing.

49:15.215 --> 49:18.238
But it's been my dream since I was a kid.

49:18.742 --> 49:21.344
to make a living as a freelance writer.

49:21.445 --> 49:26.109
I was sensible enough to give up on it or forget about it from time to time, but I really wanted it always.

49:27.090 --> 49:43.385
And so I quit my job, we stayed there, and I began to do, you know, four books a year, and 40 periodical pieces, and children's books.

49:43.525 --> 49:46.588
And stuff is job work to you, right?

49:46.838 --> 49:51.785
I managed mostly to write about things I wanted to know about, or had fun writing about.

49:51.845 --> 49:52.927
I mean, there were a lot of things.

49:52.947 --> 49:53.868
Baseball was one of them.

49:54.529 --> 49:56.632
And New Hampshire was another one of them.

49:56.672 --> 49:57.853
And poetry was another one.

49:57.873 --> 50:01.138
We didn't get much money for writing about poetry, but a little.

50:01.759 --> 50:02.660
And poetry readings.

50:03.001 --> 50:08.969
And I began to put it together from, you know, in a given year there might be 250 different sources of income.

50:09.510 --> 50:10.711
I'd judge a contest.

50:10.872 --> 50:15.478
I got a hundred bucks here and a thousand bucks there, and so on.

50:15.678 --> 50:27.556
My children's book, Oxcart Man, which came out about six years after he moved there, really probably was the thing that relieved me of anxiety.

50:27.596 --> 50:29.699
I didn't have a lot of anxiety.

50:29.779 --> 50:33.284
Every few months, I'd get worried about how I was going to take college.

50:33.305 --> 50:34.787
Who published his own book?

50:34.887 --> 50:36.249
All sorts of people.

50:36.289 --> 50:37.992
Viking published Oxcart Man.

50:38.152 --> 50:41.938
Parker Brace has done a whole bunch of style.

50:42.979 --> 50:44.942
And I've continued to do them.

50:45.580 --> 50:55.551
It was a long time when I didn't, but seven years, almost eight years ago, I started to have grandchildren, and I said, Sam, I'd rather done five or six years.

50:55.791 --> 50:58.755
But, you know, I made actually a very good living.

50:58.775 --> 51:01.277
I made a better living than I would have as a professor.

51:01.297 --> 51:04.581
Children's books are almost like annuities, because they stay in print forever.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.183
If they're good, yeah.

51:06.483 --> 51:08.405
They take off, yeah.

51:09.767 --> 51:12.550
My grandchildren would be getting income from outside.

51:12.783 --> 51:15.026
Yeah, and is that the one that went to Calveter?

51:15.246 --> 51:15.546
Yeah.

51:15.566 --> 51:16.167
Yeah.

51:16.187 --> 51:18.290
That's a big day.

51:18.370 --> 51:19.672
Well, that's big day.

51:19.732 --> 51:20.953
But others have done pretty well.

51:20.973 --> 51:22.395
Well, I review children's books.

51:23.096 --> 51:26.420
I review children's, yeah, that's one of the things I do.

51:26.440 --> 51:29.083
We do special children's books and cookbooks.

51:29.103 --> 51:30.886
Well, by the way, what's your time constraint?

51:30.946 --> 51:32.648
Well, I'm getting a little tired.

51:32.748 --> 51:33.809
How are you?

51:33.829 --> 51:34.330
I'm fine.

51:35.251 --> 51:37.454
We can wrap it up very quickly.

51:37.474 --> 51:39.156
I don't like to go over an hour either.

51:39.176 --> 51:42.520
It's very repetitive after a while.

51:42.989 --> 51:45.371
How about the farm?

51:45.451 --> 51:46.852
How large is the farm, acre-wise?

51:46.952 --> 51:48.414
152 acres.

51:48.454 --> 51:49.735
Is it a working farm still?

51:50.015 --> 51:50.756
No, no.

51:50.836 --> 51:52.597
It wouldn't be in any case.

51:52.617 --> 51:54.239
It's not just that I don't want to do farm work.

51:54.659 --> 51:57.642
That kind of farm is not possible.

51:57.702 --> 51:59.884
Oh, you could turn it into an orchard or a strawberry.

51:59.904 --> 52:00.685
Yeah, but that's what it was.

52:00.705 --> 52:01.966
No, the land isn't very good.

52:01.986 --> 52:02.906
It was a multi-farm.

52:02.947 --> 52:06.830
My grandpa had, you know, eight hoes peens, 50 sheep, 200 chickens.

52:06.850 --> 52:10.994
And he worked all day, every day, all year, and he never complained.

52:11.014 --> 52:11.494
He liked it.

52:12.065 --> 52:15.430
Are you hopeful that the farm stays in the family?

52:15.450 --> 52:20.157
I would love it if it would, and we're working on it.

52:20.177 --> 52:23.903
And I didn't ask you about baseball, but I don't know if that's terrible.

52:23.923 --> 52:25.906
You told me some of the things that you're working on.

52:27.689 --> 52:33.678
And I think it's pretty obvious that your own sense of mortality works into everything that you write.

52:34.940 --> 52:36.903
But I was a kid.

52:37.204 --> 52:38.245
That's the kicker, by the way.

52:38.265 --> 52:40.148
I'm always looking for the last sentence, you see.

52:40.246 --> 52:41.488
And that's the one.

52:41.708 --> 52:43.972
It always has.

52:44.132 --> 52:45.494
What's your zinger at the beginning?

52:45.574 --> 52:47.718
Well, this one I'll have to work on.

52:47.738 --> 52:48.279
Okay.

52:48.579 --> 52:51.364
Would you describe my book for me, please?

52:51.384 --> 52:52.746
All that's theirs and that's signed.

52:53.747 --> 52:56.331
And they've gotten behind it 100%.

52:56.612 --> 52:57.573
I'm giving talks.

52:57.593 --> 52:59.036
I'm giving four talks this month.

52:59.116 --> 52:59.977
I mean, it doesn't stop.

52:59.997 --> 53:02.020
It gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

53:02.762 --> 53:08.110
And I just told them, look, these people paid 20 bucks to get into a bookstore to buy books.

53:08.562 --> 53:09.983
You think you're not going to buy this book?

53:10.003 --> 53:12.726
They're going to go crazy over this book.

53:12.746 --> 53:14.948
I mean, you've got that as a given.

53:14.988 --> 53:18.331
But Alan called me.

53:19.512 --> 53:22.115
My agent said, I want to try Alan Peacock.

53:22.135 --> 53:22.695
And I didn't.

53:22.715 --> 53:24.837
I said, try Alan Peacock.

53:24.857 --> 53:26.279
He waited.

53:26.299 --> 53:27.400
He called.

53:27.420 --> 53:30.122
The day before Thanksgiving at 93, he called me.

53:31.183 --> 53:33.586
He said, hey, Alan, how you doing?

53:34.266 --> 53:36.148
He said, I want to tweet out of the guy.

53:36.168 --> 53:38.050
He's a lovely one.

53:38.070 --> 53:38.350
He said, yeah.

53:39.258 --> 53:44.944
I want to be in the family, have a nice Thanksgiving tomorrow, and I'm going to buy your book."

53:44.964 --> 53:46.165
He said, it's going to take a while.

53:46.746 --> 53:50.430
I've got people, even he had to convince people at home.

53:50.450 --> 53:51.511
It's going to take a while.

53:51.571 --> 53:53.293
He's just on the Pulitzer with Bart Butler.

53:53.693 --> 53:59.099
He did the Shimon Peres book.

53:59.419 --> 54:00.961
His stock was writing very high.

54:01.742 --> 54:04.245
It's going to take me a while, but trust me, we're going to buy it.

54:04.265 --> 54:05.586
He said, having said that now,

54:06.123 --> 54:06.764
I'm going to buy it.

54:07.005 --> 54:08.668
Nothing you say now will change my mind.

54:08.688 --> 54:11.012
He said, what's wrong with the book?

54:11.032 --> 54:13.376
Why didn't it random house tell it?

54:13.517 --> 54:15.240
I said, Alan, did I read it?

54:15.260 --> 54:15.841
It's wonderful.

54:15.861 --> 54:16.482
What's wrong with it?

54:17.023 --> 54:17.524
Tell me.

54:17.544 --> 54:18.606
Tell me.

54:18.766 --> 54:20.630
I said, I'm going to try this idea.

54:20.650 --> 54:21.171
I don't know why.

54:22.092 --> 54:24.917
The only thing they would ever tell me, I'd press the box on the phone.

54:24.957 --> 54:25.899
You don't want to have it.

54:25.919 --> 54:28.484
I'm sorry to pour you without it.

54:28.504 --> 54:30.207
This is probably a nightmare.

54:31.790 --> 54:33.812
I said, what's wrong with my book?

54:33.832 --> 54:36.935
You know, first, it's like being told somebody died of this.

54:36.955 --> 54:43.621
I was to be called in one morning, and I said, I'm not publishing your book.

54:43.641 --> 54:45.042
And he was not nice.

54:45.062 --> 54:45.803
He wasn't sympathetic.

54:45.823 --> 54:47.805
I got a feeling he was enjoying this, you know?

54:48.626 --> 54:50.808
And I said, well, what the hell is wrong with my book?

54:50.948 --> 54:51.929
Tell me what's wrong with it.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.091
I'll tell you what's wrong.

54:54.111 --> 54:54.932
I'll tell you what's wrong.

54:54.952 --> 55:00.717
He said, part one, you end in the great part of the book is history, and the second part is contemporary.

55:01.675 --> 55:02.696
He says, I'll tell you what's wrong.

55:02.716 --> 55:07.462
He says, part one ends in the Great Depression, and it starts part two in the 1980s.

55:07.563 --> 55:08.684
I said, yeah, that's true.

55:09.124 --> 55:10.406
There's a high reading to that.

55:11.047 --> 55:13.710
I did want to kind of get straight into the journalism.

55:14.131 --> 55:16.534
He said, you could have given me a transitional paragraph.

55:17.856 --> 55:19.297
I said, right hand.

55:19.818 --> 55:21.160
I said, transitional paragraph?

55:21.180 --> 55:21.761
I said, good point.

55:21.781 --> 55:23.042
I'll fax one within the hour.

55:23.082 --> 55:23.923
What's next?

55:23.943 --> 55:25.005
What next do you need?

55:25.886 --> 55:28.009
And he said, well, your Blumbridge chapter, the bookseed.

55:28.089 --> 55:31.513
The guy that stole the $20 million worth of books, I went to his trial, and

55:31.747 --> 55:33.789
wonderful, wonderful stuff.

55:33.809 --> 55:35.050
He said, you call him Steven.

55:36.332 --> 55:37.853
He said, you should be calling him Blumberg.

55:38.474 --> 55:41.437
I mean, we're talking really heavy stuff here.

55:41.457 --> 55:42.438
I said, yeah, good point.

55:42.498 --> 55:44.420
I'll do a search for all the Stevens in the computer.

55:44.520 --> 55:45.201
I'll change it.

55:45.241 --> 55:45.561
What else?

55:46.762 --> 55:47.103
What else?

55:47.383 --> 55:47.903
Nothing else.

55:48.964 --> 55:49.765
I called my agent.

55:50.246 --> 55:52.048
He said his everlasting credit will stop.

55:53.409 --> 55:57.433
He said, he called Bill Fox instantly, and he said, fine.

55:57.818 --> 56:03.363
He said, all right, I'm sending a messenger over there right now to make a manuscript.

56:03.383 --> 56:04.785
And he said, no, no, I'll send it over.

56:04.825 --> 56:05.465
No, no, no, no.

56:05.485 --> 56:06.006
He said, right now.

56:06.026 --> 56:06.426
Right now.

56:07.347 --> 56:08.728
He said, you're not going to tamper with it.

56:08.829 --> 56:09.850
I want it.

56:09.870 --> 56:12.192
He said, there'll be a messenger there in 10 minutes.

56:12.212 --> 56:14.034
Have it ready.

56:14.054 --> 56:18.318
And so I've got this manuscript, which is absolutely line edited.

56:19.118 --> 56:20.880
All these little marginal comments.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.562
Nick, you go, we should move this over here.

56:22.582 --> 56:23.543
We're going to move this here.

56:24.043 --> 56:25.485
No problem with the book.

56:25.505 --> 56:27.066
Straight through to the last page.

56:27.687 --> 56:34.036
It is absolutely minor that it's prepared for publication, and it's essentially a young book that is published.

56:34.056 --> 56:38.902
And they never invoked this acceptability clause, it would have been ridiculous.

56:38.922 --> 56:42.127
So I thought, I couldn't keep you there, because it's altered.

56:42.147 --> 56:44.090
I mean, I didn't know how to have a Joan Collins suit.

56:44.190 --> 56:49.577
I mean, you're only trying to cover what you lost, I guess, right there.

56:51.008 --> 56:52.250
Grim story.

56:52.270 --> 56:53.332
How many go to work?

56:53.532 --> 56:55.215
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56:55.316 --> 56:56.337
Without inspiration.

56:56.357 --> 56:56.778
I'm sorry.

56:56.818 --> 56:58.321
Let's get my ass in here.

56:58.361 --> 57:03.069
The good news is it never would have been done as well as it was by Hope.

57:03.089 --> 57:04.211
I don't think the book was great.

57:04.231 --> 57:08.880
And it was the second best-selling book at Hope last year.

57:09.280 --> 57:10.823
Congratulations.

57:15.173 --> 57:23.624
I'm sorry to bore you with that story, but it's nice, and we're going to do another book about books, and that'll be there.

57:24.665 --> 57:25.306
All right, sir.

57:26.547 --> 57:30.753
Glad to see you, Nick.

57:30.773 --> 57:31.434
Thanks.

57:31.454 --> 57:31.994
Bye-bye.

57:33.436 --> 57:33.636
Bye-bye.

57:33.716 --> 57:36.159
I'm sorry.

57:36.460 --> 57:37.401
I hope you write it up.

57:38.849 --> 57:42.812
Keep notes, and you may not write it up this year, but write it up.

57:42.832 --> 57:43.493
At some point.

57:43.833 --> 57:51.500
When I get orphaned like that, the temptation was to go tell the New York Times.

57:51.520 --> 57:52.160
I write for them.

57:52.741 --> 57:56.244
I publishes weekly, but I felt you're going to be a pariah.

57:57.105 --> 58:01.128
Your responsibility is to the book, to sell the book and get the book published.

58:02.770 --> 58:06.453
I still haven't told the story publicly yet.

58:06.473 --> 58:07.894
There's nothing to be gained from it.

58:09.106 --> 58:13.311
There's a guy in my book, a chef, you'll like this.

58:14.112 --> 58:19.599
Chef Louie lost everything in World War II and he came here to this country as a DP.

58:19.619 --> 58:25.526
He's a displaced person and he became this guy in Chicago, Louis Zafmari.

58:25.546 --> 58:35.117
He owned a bakery restaurant in Chicago and he's now given hundreds of thousands of books and major collections all over the country.

58:35.137 --> 58:37.560
I said, well, how do you feel losing those books?

58:38.367 --> 58:47.965
You know, he said, God put the eyes, he said, there's an old Hungarian saying, he said, if God wanted you to look backward, he could put the eyes in the back of your head.

58:48.005 --> 58:52.853
He said, God put the eyes in the front so we look forward.

58:52.874 --> 58:54.977
And he said, I don't look back at what I lost.

58:55.017 --> 58:59.906
He said, I look like what I'm capable of doing, which is a wonderful attitude.

58:59.926 --> 59:00.347
All right.

59:00.848 --> 59:01.970
Inspirational.

59:02.351 --> 59:02.451
Yeah.
