00:04.823 --> 00:05.785
Hi, this is Nick.

00:07.427 --> 00:09.410
It's Friday, January 23rd, 1998.

00:09.490 --> 00:24.434
I'm on my way home to Grafton from New York City, where I participated in a couple of events involving Bibliography Week.

00:27.198 --> 00:29.582
It's snowing, it's slippery, it's messy.

00:31.013 --> 00:36.361
And I listened to as much news as I cared to hear about Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton.

00:38.183 --> 01:00.075
And this seemed like a pretty good and appropriate time to summarize my thoughts regarding what could be a tentative outline for this new book, which I at present plan to call Life Beyond Life, colon, book people, book places, book culture.

01:00.612 --> 01:04.095
at the dawn of a new millennium.

01:04.155 --> 01:27.878
The title, Life Beyond Life, we derive from the famous excerpt in John Milton's Ariopagitica, where he says something to the effect that books are the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and served on purpose to a life beyond life.

01:28.639 --> 01:29.640
And that is

01:30.042 --> 01:39.056
as Milton saw it, and as many of us who care about books continue to see it, is the function that they serve.

01:42.261 --> 01:45.125
They are the precious lifeblood of a master spirit.

01:46.447 --> 01:48.971
Okay, that's background.

01:51.675 --> 01:55.982
I'm very, very interested in really trying to crystallize

01:57.700 --> 02:05.814
the substance of what will appear in this book in terms of how it will go into the individual chapters.

02:05.934 --> 02:23.083
I have made a tentative, scratched out, written, decidedly informal, outlined by subject headings, and it's very sketchy and could hardly be described.

02:24.025 --> 02:34.560
by any yardstick as being a detailed outline, but it does more or less summarize my thoughts as to what I think should go into these chapters.

02:36.223 --> 02:41.210
Here I am doing 40 miles an hour on Interstate 84 on a pretty snowy winter day.

02:41.791 --> 02:45.696
So if it sounds at some point like I'm distracted, it is because I am.

02:46.678 --> 02:51.585
It's snowing and I've decided to amuse myself

02:51.903 --> 03:04.297
and occupy this time productively by thinking out loud into this little tape recorder about the work in progress.

03:04.317 --> 03:07.441
Okay.

03:07.461 --> 03:09.163
I start with a prologue.

03:12.847 --> 03:19.615
The prologue begins with Otto Bettman playing a Bach piece for Connie

03:20.303 --> 03:23.868
and I in Florida two years ago this coming March.

03:24.889 --> 03:28.053
Otto Bettman at that time was well into his 90s.

03:29.435 --> 03:33.460
He has lived in and touched every decade of the 20th century.

03:35.904 --> 03:40.870
He is a Jewish émigré who fled Germany in 1933.

03:41.371 --> 03:49.922
He said when I interviewed him, it was like God picked me up and set me down in America.

03:51.151 --> 03:52.512
America saved his life.

03:52.593 --> 03:54.234
He had the foresight to get out.

03:55.736 --> 04:03.484
When he left, he was a rare books librarian in Germany, in Berlin, I believe.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.206
We'll have to check the files.

04:05.466 --> 04:06.107
We have it.

04:06.127 --> 04:07.789
It's been two years since I looked at that aspect.

04:08.549 --> 04:15.817
But he also was a pioneer in taking photographs of documents with his new Leica.

04:16.878 --> 04:19.301
He started taking pictures, making copies.

04:19.401 --> 04:20.382
Isn't that interesting?

04:21.155 --> 04:21.896
making copies.

04:22.416 --> 04:27.962
Think about the copies when we get into that chapter a bit later, but he's making copies.

04:28.743 --> 04:33.628
And when he came here, he brought his Leica and a trunk full of images.

04:34.729 --> 04:50.925
And he began what became known as the Bettman Archive, which in 1996 was bought by Bill Gates' Corpus Corporation.

04:52.576 --> 05:01.644
So now whenever you see the Bettman Archive, it's Corbis slash Bettman Archive, and the stuff is all being digitized and made available over the net.

05:02.885 --> 05:10.392
And subsequent to the interview with Otto Bettman, I went out to Bellevue, Washington and did some interviews there with the Corbis people.

05:12.774 --> 05:17.018
It may well be at some point that I might want to go see the original Bettman Archive in New York.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.559
That might be pretty interesting.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.402
We'll see as the writing goes along.

05:22.782 --> 05:31.992
My point is that Otto touches any number of different aspects in this book, and he belongs in the prologue.

05:32.012 --> 05:40.661
Because as he was playing this Bach piece, it was beautiful, and I tape-recorded it, I was thinking, why Bach?

05:40.681 --> 05:47.989
And when he was done, I said to him, Dr. Bettman, why Bach?

05:48.009 --> 05:52.013
And he said, because Bach always returns

05:52.685 --> 05:55.028
to the same place that he started.

05:58.111 --> 06:09.645
Now, I tentatively had planned, and I may yet still have two chapters called Continuum, Continuum One and Continuum Two.

06:10.846 --> 06:12.929
And what is it about a continuum?

06:12.949 --> 06:14.210
And what is it about the way I write?

06:14.270 --> 06:15.672
When you think of General Madness,

06:17.508 --> 06:19.210
I came back to where I started.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.232
That's the way I like to write my stories.

06:21.492 --> 06:23.834
I like to come back to where I started.

06:25.275 --> 06:43.633
No matter how much I might want to improvise or wander and go far afield and do these discursive things, I always feel that I'm okay as long as I come back to where I started and it's my track.

06:44.525 --> 06:56.883
So here's Otto expressing that, and here he is touching all of these various aspects that we will be developing in the book, and he comes back to where he started.

06:58.826 --> 07:03.813
Well, I love that, and so therefore, we have that in the prologue.

07:03.833 --> 07:14.228
Straight off, bang, we have come, my wife and I, to the Florida home of Otto Bettman, and he's playing this song.

07:14.663 --> 07:20.769
and then we go into some of the material that I've already written and developed for my Biblio column.

07:21.690 --> 07:43.371
Also in the prologue, from Otto, where we express the continuum concept, from there I will discuss how I tried, quixotically perhaps, to go and visit some of the great libraries and book places in the world.

07:44.228 --> 08:10.017
to establish and to give a dramatic narrative in narrative fashion an adventure that would take me from Pergamum where there was still this relic, these ruins of an ancient library that one time competed straight up with Alexandria and Egypt.

08:11.448 --> 08:17.154
and then we come forward and we go to Patmos and we go to Mount Athos and we go to St.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.997
Gaul where St.

08:21.558 --> 08:36.152
Columba, a medieval bibliomaniac, that might be a phrase we want to use, a medieval bibliomaniac came and established that monastery where the plans of St.

08:36.172 --> 08:39.075
Gaul were later developed and designed

08:39.427 --> 08:53.422
and to a great extent influenced how monasteries and scriptorio were constructed through Europe during this critical period of preservation and transmission.

08:53.442 --> 08:59.409
But we also go to Monte Cassino, where the rule of Benedict was formulated, and we discussed the importance of that.

08:59.429 --> 09:01.551
But this is really in chapter one.

09:01.571 --> 09:03.894
I'm jumping ahead of myself.

09:03.914 --> 09:07.678
But we wanted to just suggest some of this in the prologue.

09:09.025 --> 09:32.506
And then we will conclude the prologue with the little anecdote that I have told a number of times in my public presentations at libraries around the United States, throughout the United States over the past two and a half years.

09:32.526 --> 09:38.712
And the purpose of this anecdote is to provide a seamless transition

09:39.535 --> 09:45.161
as seamless a transition as possible from gentle madness to life beyond life.

09:46.082 --> 10:07.686
And so I tell the story in April of 1995 as I was feverishly attempting to get the galleys closed and corrected and off to New York so we could get the book published and out on time.

10:08.408 --> 10:24.589
It happened that I needed to see a copy of the 1911 edition of the three-volume catalog to the library of Samuel Pepys at Modeling College, Cambridge University, England.

10:24.609 --> 10:33.640
I won't point to this too deeply in the prologue, but the point is I needed to see the books for bibliographical purposes.

10:34.092 --> 10:39.779
I had worked off an incomplete Xerox copy, which Richard Luckett had sent to me.

10:40.480 --> 10:46.568
And we wanted to cite it in the bibliography and in the footnotes, and I really needed to see the books.

10:47.129 --> 10:51.294
And I couldn't get Luckett on the phone, and so I needed to see the books.

10:52.095 --> 10:52.516
Guess what?

10:52.576 --> 10:55.480
I couldn't find them at Harvard.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.721
Not the 1911 edition.

10:56.741 --> 10:57.722
They had an earlier edition.

10:57.742 --> 10:59.485
They had a later edition.

10:59.505 --> 11:01.768
I couldn't find one at the Boston Public Library.

11:01.788 --> 11:03.610
I couldn't find one in Worcester, certainly.

11:03.978 --> 11:32.635
at Clark and there's other places that I read and there's no reason why such an art king title would be at those places anyway but lo and behold and to make a long story short I was in Boston and I went over to the Boston Athenaeum where I read and of course they don't deaccession there and their policy is to keep and to maintain and to preserve and lo and behold I find the books

11:33.290 --> 11:34.611
They're in perfect condition.

11:36.313 --> 11:36.693
Lovely.

11:36.973 --> 11:37.614
Three volumes.

11:39.375 --> 11:48.443
And the Athenaeum, and still even to this day as we speak, the books are signed out, not scanned.

11:49.945 --> 11:59.934
And as I was signing out these books, I noticed that I am the first person in 84 years to take out these books.

12:00.714 --> 12:01.575
There they have been.

12:02.332 --> 12:04.815
They're dusty, but in otherwise perfect condition.

12:05.556 --> 12:06.177
And there they are.

12:08.219 --> 12:14.927
And I note this fact as I'm signing out the books, and I say something really incredulous and naive and dumb.

12:15.828 --> 12:18.571
But, oh, gee, look at that.

12:19.612 --> 12:20.553
84 years.

12:20.894 --> 12:23.397
I'm the first person to ever take out these books.

12:25.299 --> 12:28.763
You wonder who they bought these books for in the first place.

12:28.783 --> 12:32.187
And so the gentleman who's there, whose name I have to get,

12:32.605 --> 12:39.794
A silver-haired man looked me in the eyes and said, why, we bought them for you, sir.

12:40.314 --> 12:42.036
We bought them for you, sir.

12:45.020 --> 13:01.920
So when you think and when you wonder, as libraries throughout the United States particularly are deciding whether or not they should keep books in their libraries on the basis and on the strength of

13:02.288 --> 13:03.689
of frequency of use.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.271
What is the purpose of Mindbooks?

13:06.291 --> 13:16.921
Is it just to serve today's readers or a reader who might be interested in something three or five years from now?

13:18.542 --> 13:23.406
If a book has not been withdrawn within five years, then it's a candidate for the accession.

13:24.287 --> 13:27.730
These are issues that we deal with later in the book.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.912
But there's our prologue.

13:30.873 --> 13:32.194
We bought it for you, sir.

13:33.271 --> 13:46.324
And we go from there, immediately, from that quote, our comment upon that quote, into Chapter 1, which would be Continuum 1, or just Continuum.

13:46.424 --> 13:51.429
I think Continuum 1, and I do believe we will conclude the book at the end with Continuum 2.

13:52.510 --> 13:56.995
Either Roman numeral 1 and Roman numeral 2 are the words 1 and 2.

13:57.655 --> 13:58.176
We'll see.

13:59.697 --> 14:01.219
That remains to be determined.

14:03.832 --> 14:11.962
But we go straight from, we got it for you, sir, to this high hill in Pergamum.

14:11.982 --> 14:17.989
And here I am, there, to absorb the ambience of this ancient library.

14:19.731 --> 14:20.752
And we talk about that.

14:21.573 --> 14:30.784
And then we continue on through this cavalcade of libraries

14:32.553 --> 14:49.856
from Pergamum to Patmos, from Patmos to Mount Athos, perhaps from Mount Athos to Monte Cassino, from Monte Cassino when a little Benedict was formed to Saint Gaul.

14:51.899 --> 14:52.660
We're still cooking.

14:53.461 --> 15:02.273
Now Monte Cassino is destroyed, has been destroyed four times through the centuries of its existence.

15:03.046 --> 15:22.797
most recently in World War II, when it had been used by the Germans to direct artillery fire at Allied troops, and the Allies, after warning the residents to leave the mountain, destroyed the abbey at Munchies.

15:23.358 --> 15:25.501
Interestingly enough, the books survived.

15:27.044 --> 15:29.728
The place was destroyed, but the books survived.

15:31.598 --> 15:51.988
Let me interject at this point that when I did an interview with Eva Hanebert Benz, the director of the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz in Germany, she said, you know, I was asking her about, here we were, really very, very close to where Gutenberg had set up his first printing shop.

15:52.008 --> 15:58.197
We don't know precisely where his shop was, but it couldn't have been far from where this museum now stands.

15:59.476 --> 16:00.737
And she said, we really don't know that.

16:00.757 --> 16:01.959
We don't have his press.

16:01.979 --> 16:08.226
This is an imaginative reconstruction of his press that they have there.

16:09.227 --> 16:10.889
And none of his type survives.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.112
And none of his records survive.

16:14.353 --> 16:17.776
And really a very fragmentary portrait of Gutenberg himself survives.

16:19.698 --> 16:24.344
All we have, she said, is the book.

16:24.364 --> 16:25.585
And the book, of course, that we

16:26.290 --> 16:31.735
Referred to here is also known as the Lutenberg Bible, the 42-line Bible, the Mediterranean Bible.

16:33.056 --> 16:34.817
But it's the book that survives.

16:35.778 --> 16:36.999
We're talking about paper, aren't we?

16:37.600 --> 16:42.284
We're talking about buildings that are destroyed, buildings of stone, cresses made of steel.

16:44.106 --> 16:44.646
They're gone.

16:45.267 --> 16:52.533
But what you would think would be the most fragile element, the book, that survives.

16:54.375 --> 16:54.795
So...

16:55.889 --> 17:03.516
a very, very important point to make, I think, here, when we're at Monte Casino.

17:05.157 --> 17:21.112
And I think you could put in parenthetically there, you know, one of our little discursive ways of writing that we enjoy doing so much mentioned the book Survive.

17:22.152 --> 17:23.854
And I think that as we continue to write,

17:24.627 --> 17:25.889
as I continue to write.

17:28.413 --> 17:30.295
I'll find other examples of that.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.619
Maybe we can use three or four of those things.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.782
The books don't always survive, though.

17:40.951 --> 17:52.288
But they don't survive when they are deliberately destroyed, and that would introduce the Sarajevo matter and the Cambodia matter.

17:54.563 --> 17:57.086
But there is a sense of survival, and there is an attempt to survive.

17:57.106 --> 17:58.047
Well, that's jumping ahead.

17:59.689 --> 18:01.832
Excuse me.

18:01.852 --> 18:06.217
So, I think we were last at St.

18:06.237 --> 18:07.678
Gall and Monte Cassino.

18:09.501 --> 18:24.418
And then at this particular point, I think I'll shoot over to England, and I'll do the Durham Cathedral Library, which survived the wrath of Henry VIII when he

18:24.736 --> 18:31.986
and dissolved the monastery, seized their property, and destroyed their structures and burned their books.

18:34.230 --> 18:37.855
Miraculously, Durham Cathedral Library made it through.

18:40.238 --> 18:43.683
Once again, destruction, survival, the books survived.

18:43.804 --> 18:45.546
Not all of them, but some.

18:47.315 --> 18:54.783
and then maybe over to the Hereford Cathedral Library where we have chained libraries, a working chained library.

18:55.183 --> 19:12.282
Don't forget to bring in this wonderful book, Akira Books by John Willis Clark, which is the development of library design and how that has influenced how scholarship has been conducted over the centuries.

19:12.762 --> 19:15.465
Books are chained, they can't move, the desks are there.

19:16.019 --> 19:21.284
Are you building your desks and cabinets and presses and your windows?

19:21.945 --> 19:35.597
And then, of course, we have the cloisters also at Durham Cathedral, where I am led to believe that there are still authentic spaces and cells where the monks in their scriptoria work.

19:35.617 --> 19:36.038
We'll see.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.281
But we'll be able to get that in.

19:42.183 --> 19:42.904
From there,

19:43.913 --> 19:48.037
I think from there we'll either go to Italy or to Spain.

19:49.719 --> 19:50.780
How do we want to do this?

19:51.261 --> 19:53.263
Spain is a very interesting case study.

19:55.985 --> 20:05.115
The Biblioteca Colombina, which was founded by the son of Christopher Columbus, who was a bibliophile, and put one of his father's books in there.

20:05.815 --> 20:12.182
This was the first library, apparently, that was built with money from the New World, with riches obtained from the New World.

20:14.288 --> 20:42.363
And we wish to point out here, a matter of some importance, that the history of America, history as we know it, and the history as it pertains to the Europeans who came here, not the Indians or as they are oftentimes called Native American, but the European presence in North America is bracketed by print.

20:42.383 --> 20:43.384
It is totally

20:44.596 --> 20:49.000
recorded in history, and not only in history, but in printed books.

20:49.020 --> 20:59.049
It was, in fact, through a printed letter that Columbus announced his discovery.

20:59.069 --> 21:00.130
We get that in right there.

21:00.331 --> 21:06.657
We want to get the archive of the Indies in here, which you'll also be seeing in Spain.

21:08.218 --> 21:11.481
And then from there we go to Italy, and I suspect that

21:13.891 --> 21:17.697
Continuum One will conclude in Italy.

21:20.622 --> 21:28.295
This wonderful country, this extraordinary country where you have so many libraries and different kinds of libraries.

21:28.315 --> 21:38.852
You have in excess of 1,000 ecclesiastic libraries, which account for some 27 million books.

21:40.587 --> 21:44.553
And that does not include the Vatican Library, which is technically not part of Italy.

21:45.555 --> 21:46.496
It's the Vatican Library.

21:46.536 --> 21:49.180
That's the Pope's library.

21:51.965 --> 21:53.247
Let's pass the snowplow here.

21:53.347 --> 21:54.388
And so it's a little tricky.

21:54.408 --> 21:55.250
And we've passed him.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.351
And now we're doing fine.

21:58.475 --> 21:59.376
OK.

21:59.596 --> 22:00.798
Now we're passing another truck.

22:03.763 --> 22:08.991
But then you also have, I believe we'll have to ascertain, you have a half a dozen or so.

22:09.342 --> 22:19.520
national libraries in Italy, not one like the Library of Congress here or the British Library in England or the Bibliotheque Nationale in France, etc., etc., etc.

22:20.843 --> 22:31.722
And the reason for that is Italy, unlike these other countries, has only been a nation for about 125 years.

22:35.566 --> 22:41.692
It was Garibaldi who pulled them together in 1876, as Umberto Eco mentioned to me.

22:42.533 --> 22:52.983
And so all these libraries were in place, representing these various areas and regions and provinces of Italy, and they're still there.

22:53.423 --> 23:04.594
And then we also had this string of pearls, these wonderful libraries that just kind of go across the top of Italy and then kind of snake their way down through the line.

23:06.717 --> 23:20.873
So far, I have visited and am able now to write about the Ambrosiana in Milano, the Capitulare in Verona, the Medicea Lorenziana in Milan.

23:21.954 --> 23:32.065
I will be visiting, I hope, the famous library in Chechnya.

23:32.466 --> 23:34.328
It looks like Cecina, but it's Chechnya.

23:35.270 --> 23:40.116
which Hobson says is, in fact, the oldest continuous library in the world.

23:40.196 --> 23:45.002
And then he also says maybe even the Capitular in Verona is.

23:45.022 --> 23:52.272
And in each of these, we have to write a little story about the prominent people in the manner which we will do at St.

23:52.312 --> 23:54.014
Columba, at St.

23:54.034 --> 24:01.704
Gall, at Benedict, at Monte Cassino, at, I think, Ambrosiana, or at St.

24:01.784 --> 24:04.247
Cardinal Borromeo, who had bought books.

24:04.835 --> 24:11.384
And this library kind of went up as a statement of the anti-Reformation, as an outpost against Luther.

24:11.404 --> 24:24.400
Luther, whose whole movement, by the way, was made possible strictly by the printing press, and as has also been argued, the French Revolution.

24:24.881 --> 24:29.307
Look what books, look what print, look what print hath rise.

24:32.331 --> 24:33.272
So that's it got you.

24:33.826 --> 24:47.100
Now, whether or not we end it there, this Continuum 1, or we go directly into the libraries of the future, I think I will save them for Continuum 2, that discussion of Continuum 2.

24:48.562 --> 24:50.164
You know, let's just think about that right now.

24:50.204 --> 24:54.989
Continuum 2 to conclude the book with these modern, futuristic libraries.

24:55.049 --> 25:00.475
And for those who say the libraries are dead as we know them, why are they going up all over the world at the same time?

25:01.687 --> 25:04.751
in addition to the ones I've visited and still plan to visit, the new ones.

25:05.812 --> 25:12.680
I mean, there's also a new one in Mexico City, there's a new one in Tokyo, there's a new one in Sweden, which I have visited.

25:14.602 --> 25:15.002
Everywhere.

25:16.284 --> 25:27.036
And the epilogue, we may as well state it now, will be, I hope, assuming we can arrange it, a visit to Alexandria in Egypt, where they are building another

25:27.573 --> 25:31.077
the great library on the site of the ancient library of Alexandria.

25:31.097 --> 25:38.725
That is our, bringing us, like Otto Bettman, back to where we started at Frigam of the Great Rival.

25:39.566 --> 25:43.931
So that will be the epilogue, as I now have it conceived.

25:44.992 --> 25:49.176
So after we conclude with Italy, yes, that sounds good and that feels good.

25:49.196 --> 25:50.678
After we conclude with Italy,

25:54.185 --> 26:06.741
I will either go into a discussion of the emigre booksellers, the Jewish emigres, and in a much larger context than just booksellers, because unfortunately most of them are dead.

26:08.263 --> 26:18.977
We have been able to talk with a few survivors, Marguerite Goldschmidt and Anne Rothenbacher, who talked to me about their late husbands.

26:18.997 --> 26:23.483
I do hope at some point to talk to Anne-Marie Krauss,

26:24.577 --> 26:30.124
daughter of Hans B. Krause and her husband, Roland Folter.

26:32.787 --> 26:34.329
I've talked to Barney Rosenthal.

26:35.450 --> 26:50.027
Barney, of course, gave the Malkin Lecture on the Gentle Invaders, and I have indicated to Barney that I would like to use that as the title of this chapter, Gentle Invaders.

26:51.813 --> 27:01.007
and give him full credit, either in the main body or in an end note.

27:01.027 --> 27:04.873
Perhaps, you know, I have no problems using somebody else's title.

27:05.114 --> 27:12.385
I like it, I appropriate it, and I'll give credit to it.

27:12.405 --> 27:15.630
So maybe we will do that, the tradition of booksellers.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.356
The European tradition of booksellers

27:19.792 --> 27:22.095
and the emigres as they came here.

27:22.155 --> 27:33.648
Now, it'll either be in that context or do the general booksellers chapter and then do the emigres after.

27:33.668 --> 27:34.329
I don't know.

27:35.190 --> 27:39.335
Or I might just have to fold that emigres into the much larger bookseller chapter.

27:40.697 --> 27:44.982
I'm not so sure that's going to work quite the way I have it in mind.

27:45.002 --> 27:48.786
So I think maybe we will go from, let's plan to do Gentle Invaders

27:49.424 --> 28:10.403
and then go straight into the whole tradition of book selling the european tradition of book selling and how it's maintained today in practice and then here you know the people who i have already interviewed now nico israel will either go in that

28:13.403 --> 28:16.546
gentle invaders, even though he didn't come to America.

28:17.247 --> 28:29.519
He hid from the Germans, the Nazis in Holland, and his brother Max was out in the woods, literally, in the forest, where he's learned medical books and became the great bookseller of medical literature.

28:31.400 --> 28:43.292
Nico's recollections are wonderful, but he's also one of the great bookmen of his day, so we will include Nico in there, or with the gentle invaders.

28:44.875 --> 28:49.502
I mentioned Fred Schreiber.

28:50.083 --> 28:58.595
Fred Schreiber could go... I think Fred Schreiber goes into the Eucharist scholar, the scholar-bookseller.

29:00.778 --> 29:02.561
The scholar-bookseller, the tradition.

29:02.701 --> 29:13.617
All right, what we will do is discuss the... You know, as we write the thing, let's go ahead and write... Let's try and write that chapter with the Jewish booksellers.

29:14.255 --> 29:16.799
and see if there's enough to sustain that as a chapter.

29:16.819 --> 29:19.023
It may only be 10,000 words.

29:21.908 --> 29:35.451
Actually, in the book culture context, so we can tell the story of Hans Krauss, of Russ Lauer, of Walter Johnson, of Schatzky, of the Rosenthal's.

29:38.216 --> 29:40.279
Let's do it there.

29:40.883 --> 29:45.489
As we're going along, we're discussing the tradition of the scholar, bookseller, which is what they brought.

29:46.810 --> 29:52.878
And then we will get into a more, and also Kurt Wolf, the publisher who came here.

29:54.400 --> 29:59.486
Otto Bettman, I think here is where we can bring Otto in.

30:03.131 --> 30:08.157
Exiled in Paradise, that whole idea of being exiled in paradise, here.

30:08.879 --> 30:16.809
And perhaps we begin this chapter with an image of Christelnacht.

30:16.829 --> 30:20.394
Or we save that for the Sarajevo segment.

30:20.414 --> 30:27.123
Well, we'll just have to play it by ear and see how best it works.

30:27.143 --> 30:38.498
So, among booksellers, scholar booksellers, Pia Beres, Carlo Alberto Chiesa,

30:40.570 --> 30:48.602
John Maggs, I don't know if he's a scholar per se, but his company is certainly distinguished.

30:48.622 --> 30:54.210
We would mention Quaritch to a degree, but we really didn't get anybody over there to help us.

30:54.932 --> 30:57.075
I'm tired of Arthur Freeman, frankly.

30:58.677 --> 31:01.602
And he didn't give us anything useful or worthwhile.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.144
So I think we'll leave Arthur alone.

31:05.507 --> 31:07.270
But Steve Weissman, for sure.

31:08.971 --> 31:10.753
Peter Howard, these are Americans.

31:12.536 --> 31:16.180
Well, Weissman is an emigre in reverse, isn't he?

31:16.200 --> 31:19.465
He's gone back to England.

31:19.485 --> 31:20.626
Roger says he's essential.

31:22.469 --> 31:26.394
And Steve gave us some pretty good stories.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.517
In America, Peter Howard and Bill Reese.

31:28.537 --> 31:29.718
I haven't interviewed Bill yet.

31:29.758 --> 31:30.780
I have to interview Bill.

31:32.041 --> 31:36.447
Bring in Priscilla Javelis, Leona Rostenberger, Madeline Stern.

31:37.557 --> 31:38.578
scholar booksellers.

31:43.985 --> 31:51.976
Priscilla Jubeles, who I want in here in some capacity, and perhaps this is the place to put her.

31:53.037 --> 32:04.953
Or if it comes to pass that I do a chapter on the book arts, which I would really like to do, I'll say Priscilla for the book arts chapter.

32:05.414 --> 32:05.814
Book arts.

32:06.475 --> 32:07.176
The book arts.

32:08.877 --> 32:15.664
Maybe that's what we'll call it, unless we can come up with something a little more singy.

32:15.684 --> 32:20.809
So, okay, so we've got the first three chapters, we've got the prologue, and we've got the first three chapters.

32:20.829 --> 32:27.316
Now, how will develop from here remains to be seen, and I have the feeling.

32:29.738 --> 32:36.705
We do have a couple of chapters that are narrative-driven.

32:36.725 --> 32:37.686
And they include...

32:38.898 --> 32:41.040
the destruction of the Sarajevo Library.

32:43.583 --> 32:48.369
You see, because the future is not entirely rosy and brave New World-ish, is it?

32:49.170 --> 32:57.859
The human capacity to create and to preserve and to do wonderful things is balanced by the human capacity to destroy.

33:00.242 --> 33:07.150
The war on culture, the war on memory, that was a possible chapter titled

33:08.210 --> 33:12.656
which I got from Andreas Riedelmeier at Harvard.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.141
I will save that.

33:16.181 --> 33:17.723
That's not at this particular point.

33:17.763 --> 33:24.672
I need something to come right after the scholar booksellers.

33:24.692 --> 33:37.069
And I think, actually, what would work nice at this particular point, but this all remains to be seen, are the writers and artists

33:38.011 --> 33:42.536
who have been shaped by their books, by their reading.

33:45.079 --> 34:01.859
And these would include Maurice Sendak, Umberto Eco, Stephen Jay Gould, Tilly Olsen thus far, and also for background, or I may say William Blake.

34:01.879 --> 34:05.723
If I do a book arts chapter, then Blake will go in there.

34:07.745 --> 34:09.027
If not, he goes in here.

34:09.787 --> 34:19.979
Milton, John Milton, who graduated cum laude from Cambridge University.

34:22.562 --> 34:23.203
A brilliant man.

34:25.045 --> 34:27.248
After his graduation, continued to read.

34:27.268 --> 34:31.273
He spent the next five years reading, preparing himself for the work at hand.

34:33.035 --> 34:34.917
George Bernard Shaw, who

34:35.386 --> 34:41.654
It's a product of the British Library, and Alfred Kazin is a product of the New York Public Library.

34:42.615 --> 34:48.623
Certainly has paid great debts to the contributions of the New York Public Library.

34:52.228 --> 34:56.774
You know, we understand that Malcolm X learned how to read in a prison library.

34:59.137 --> 35:02.221
Isn't that interesting?

35:02.241 --> 35:03.182
We have Borges.

35:03.702 --> 35:33.422
I also don't know where this would work, but I want to just keep it in mind as something to use at some point, but the writers, the great writers who have been librarians, and I do believe that it includes Geta, Borges, Lessing, Casanova's not a great writer, but he was a librarian, Archibald McLeish,

35:35.562 --> 35:39.046
And we'll think of some other people.

35:43.752 --> 35:44.914
So that's what we'll do with the writers.

35:44.954 --> 35:47.797
But then we also want a reading chapter.

35:47.817 --> 35:49.419
A reading chapter.

35:49.479 --> 36:01.975
And whether or not these people are in the reading chapter, or there are two reading chapters, we'll just have to determine that by how it writes.

36:04.148 --> 36:11.838
But I like when Tony Grafton gave that speech a year ago today at the Bibliographical Society of America meeting, which I attended.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.840
I'm not attending today because of the snow.

36:14.581 --> 36:20.990
I'm down at 35 miles an hour in central Connecticut.

36:21.010 --> 36:30.662
He gave a really exciting talk, a copy which I really do have to get you from Arthur Steyer or from Tony Grafton.

36:31.132 --> 36:35.358
It's about reading, he said, is really hot.

36:35.378 --> 36:51.362
All right, so reading, reading, what we get from reading, the annotations of reading is, you have Coleridge, one of the great readers of all time, who thoroughly kept a reader's notebook.

36:52.143 --> 37:00.295
Virginia Woolf, who wrote an essay on how to read, but who never was schooled formally, was entirely educated at home.

37:01.996 --> 37:03.658
Don't forget to bring in Abraham Lincoln.

37:03.938 --> 37:07.621
Never went past the second grade, did he?

37:07.721 --> 37:13.266
And a couple of anecdotes we picked up on him.

37:13.747 --> 37:20.253
And then the nice little story that we already have, the four books a year story, which I've already written.

37:20.813 --> 37:23.295
And I think it's pretty clean, the way it's written.

37:23.315 --> 37:31.783
The Stephen Cusisto story, which I just wrote, the fellow who quite literally

37:34.160 --> 37:44.812
was told that reading is dangerous to his health, and we talk about that, and he carried around a letter which said he can only read for half an hour a time, and then his eye was damaged by a sharp bookmark.

37:48.416 --> 37:49.638
You know, it's a cute story.

37:49.718 --> 37:59.509
It's not cute, it's poignant again, and I don't want to use that word, but when people say reading is dangerous, it makes you think.

38:00.603 --> 38:03.306
This is where it's physically dangerous.

38:03.546 --> 38:07.970
I've never actually heard of any other case where reading is physically dangerous to your health.

38:07.990 --> 38:12.174
And I would contrast that immediately right there, immediately right there.

38:13.435 --> 38:14.476
Next segment, pop.

38:16.278 --> 38:21.843
The pediatrician in Boston who recently was written up in the New York Times.

38:22.924 --> 38:26.948
I forget his name, but I have it in the database.

38:29.206 --> 38:56.023
and and he runs a medical center in boston for four people and as part of his program they actually prescribe books books are made part of the early care and attention that they give and every kid that comes in for a checkup a routine checkup a physical is given a book

38:56.763 --> 38:59.366
instead of a lollipop or a toothbrush or whatever.

38:59.406 --> 39:09.395
And the hope is that by the time the kid enters first grade, the kid has a small home library of books.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.318
They've started to build their library.

39:12.338 --> 39:25.251
And so we go from books being injurious to your health and books being beneficial to your health in a very literal sense.

39:25.585 --> 39:30.211
so we can bracket that in the way that we've bracketed a lot of things in Gentle Madness.

39:30.311 --> 39:36.438
I like that format of symmetry.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.361
Ding-dong.

39:38.781 --> 39:39.062
Nice.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.246
And so that's reading.

39:42.266 --> 39:44.248
The reading chapter, the reading chapter.

39:48.033 --> 39:52.598
What still has to be formulated is a bibliography chapter.

39:52.919 --> 39:55.542
I will have to do an interview with Thomas Tanzel,

39:55.994 --> 40:00.401
I already have done an extensive interview with Father Boyle at the Vatican Library.

40:00.461 --> 40:04.167
We have Carol Fitzgerald in the Rivers of America.

40:04.207 --> 40:06.911
We have Audrey Hahnemann of Hemingway.

40:06.951 --> 40:16.045
We have Owen Gingrich chasing the great Copernicus chase.

40:16.244 --> 40:34.194
scanning, spanning the globe, searching the globe for every possible first and second edition copy of The Revolution of Les Orbis of Copernicus, which he said was once alleged to be the greatest book never read.

40:34.214 --> 40:41.205
He tried to disprove that by looking at the annotations of the earliest readers of that book, and he's come up with some startling findings.

40:41.573 --> 40:46.798
Again, it's the text, and we're not just want to call it bibliography, but what we learn from text.

40:47.219 --> 41:06.277
And I think within this context right here, so this would be a nice full chapter, we can also get into the whole concept of the history of the book, which is really a fairly recent social science.

41:09.020 --> 41:10.922
In the last 20 years,

41:11.948 --> 41:16.114
The French call it.

41:17.276 --> 41:18.718
Robert Darnton at Princeton.

41:18.738 --> 41:24.987
Wouldn't it be great if I could do an interview with Darnton at Princeton on this subject?

41:26.689 --> 41:31.556
To just go back briefly, I was mentioning writers, creators.

41:32.277 --> 41:40.048
I failed to include there Robert Cole's books that you can live

41:40.619 --> 41:44.165
your life by, stories that you can live your life by.

41:44.906 --> 41:51.496
You know, maybe that could also go with a pediatrician.

41:51.576 --> 41:53.960
I don't know, we'll have to see.

41:54.621 --> 41:55.443
But it's pretty good.

41:55.843 --> 41:57.826
It would work.

41:59.048 --> 42:03.876
I want to get into the canon debate, the culture wars.

42:04.835 --> 42:13.487
I think I already have a tentative lead on that, a beginning academic debates are best left to academics.

42:13.508 --> 42:28.429
But we are talking about books and books that it is threatened may no longer be part of college curriculum, which are said to no longer be relevant.

42:28.645 --> 42:37.954
So, we will get into that discussion, and that discussion will be advanced by people I've already interviewed.

42:37.975 --> 42:44.581
Harold Bloom, Alfred Kazin, Helen Vendler, Robert Fagels, a classicist and translator.

42:47.284 --> 42:50.007
Books by Robert Alter.

42:50.027 --> 42:51.408
I don't think I have to interview him.

42:51.428 --> 42:58.095
He's on the record in his book, which is very good.

42:59.442 --> 43:01.504
So that's on the canon.

43:01.524 --> 43:06.588
And let's just remember that we've got all this stuff, all these people.

43:06.848 --> 43:13.815
I'm not going to resolve the canon debate, but I do have people arguing it.

43:15.136 --> 43:28.167
And, of course, we've had the Association of Literary Critics and Scholars, ALCS, of which I'm a member.

43:28.450 --> 43:29.011
in fact.

43:30.712 --> 43:36.677
And I pretend that one of their meetings and Roger Shattuck's comments there.

43:38.319 --> 43:39.960
And I don't think we need an interview with him.

43:40.100 --> 43:46.126
We've got his comments, everything caught him from that, our impressions from that.

43:47.127 --> 43:58.457
And maybe Mary Lefkowitz, who wrote, not out of Africa, in response to this Afro-centrist claim that the Greeks stole from the Africans.

43:59.365 --> 44:26.183
an absurd notion but it has to be addressed and she addressed it so we've got the canon there to a great extent and so where do we go from there we've done the readers we've done the bibliography we've done the canon um i guess at this point i would do the san francisco public library story

44:27.412 --> 44:32.400
case study of public libraries, and that takes care of that.

44:33.342 --> 44:37.428
Public libraries, and then we would work in the New York Public Library.

44:40.554 --> 44:51.732
I really am not going to go to all the public libraries in America by any means, but I think you frame the debate with San Fran, New York as large city libraries.

44:51.998 --> 44:55.743
Let's go to the small town library, which is part of the community.

44:55.763 --> 45:00.009
Maybe we could get Cleveland in there because we've been through Cleveland.

45:00.029 --> 45:02.252
Cleveland is part of the book culture story.

45:03.313 --> 45:06.337
How Cleveland works into here, the idea of book culture.

45:07.919 --> 45:09.802
Book culture in America or in Cleveland?

45:09.822 --> 45:10.443
Middle America.

45:12.245 --> 45:13.326
Well, we'll see, won't we?

45:15.029 --> 45:16.230
We'll see how that works.

45:17.031 --> 45:21.297
So at this point, we do San Francisco public cautionary jail.

45:22.323 --> 45:23.364
and all that entails.

45:24.626 --> 45:25.747
That's a discrete chapter.

45:25.807 --> 45:28.370
That's pretty much like a Texas chapter in General Madness.

45:30.072 --> 45:32.895
From there, let's give them two good ones, bang, bang.

45:37.701 --> 45:45.070
Let's go next to Harvard and Cornell and the institutional chapters.

45:45.090 --> 45:47.893
And we can call this paradigm lost, paradigm regained.

45:49.835 --> 45:52.178
Paradigm lost, paradigm retained.

45:53.508 --> 45:57.172
Paradigm lost, paradigm retained.

45:57.192 --> 46:01.116
So we're playing on the two, again, John Milton.

46:01.136 --> 46:06.421
Two of his poems, Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, but also Retained.

46:07.282 --> 46:07.702
I don't know.

46:08.443 --> 46:10.265
Think about it.

46:10.285 --> 46:13.768
And we start in Harvard, at the Depository.

46:13.788 --> 46:17.232
We talk to Ken Carpenter.

46:17.252 --> 46:21.036
Go with him on a book-starting tour.

46:21.176 --> 46:22.317
We quote him.

46:23.056 --> 46:52.675
about books and now we're kind of really getting into the the deaccession business the history of the printed book business the virtual library the numbers that matter the farmington plan where where subject matters were carved up like like countries on a map like we're back in the late 40s right after world war ii the research library association group sat down and divided up the world

46:53.313 --> 47:00.100
of the books they were going to collect and they were establishing turf.

47:00.300 --> 47:01.561
We get a lot of that in there.

47:01.721 --> 47:05.345
At David Stamm, we interview here.

47:05.365 --> 47:23.202
And I think, by the way, going back to New York Public, San Francisco Public and New York Public, that's the place, that is the place to use the recently disclosed material on the deaccessioning.

47:23.907 --> 47:33.221
of pamphlets and pamphlets and monographs, et cetera.

47:33.942 --> 47:50.186
But Stam's point today, very, very, very stressfully made, he stressed it, it wasn't stressful, but they didn't compromise the research material.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.470
They have the research material.

47:52.490 --> 47:53.391
What they did,

47:53.759 --> 47:57.904
was change formats.

47:57.924 --> 47:59.626
At San Francisco, what they did was dump.

48:00.507 --> 48:04.491
And you got Gina Manoudry saying she does not see her role as a research library.

48:04.511 --> 48:05.552
Well, you know, there you go.

48:06.313 --> 48:08.356
San Fran, New York.

48:09.357 --> 48:16.144
Brand new library, but it doesn't see itself as a research library that's no longer their function.

48:16.164 --> 48:19.248
New York, one of the great research libraries in the world.

48:20.790 --> 48:22.872
And it does.

48:23.375 --> 48:48.353
that's pretty good i like that maybe that's where we use the new york public libraries okay so uh getting back to harvard where we start with the depository and ken carpenter the image i've occasionally used and enjoy using the valley of the kings and books

48:48.552 --> 49:18.390
the books are put to sleep and then we can enter the discussion and then we go to Cornell high above Cayuga's waters in that room the books are sliced and diced they've been guillotined to use the phrase the jargon they look like veal cutlets filleted and pounded and

49:18.944 --> 49:21.668
and ready to be breaded or whatever.

49:22.249 --> 49:26.977
And here they are, sliced and diced, ready to be scanned.

49:27.998 --> 49:30.042
And we go into that whole discussion there.

49:30.062 --> 49:33.487
And what we have here are two Ivy League institutions.

49:33.507 --> 49:45.947
We're framing the debate with two Ivy League institutions, two five-star universities, two great universities, where one is going one way and the other is going another way.

49:46.484 --> 50:04.308
And then we would bring into this discussion our visits to Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, Toronto, absolutely.

50:05.429 --> 50:12.559
Or maybe we'll save Toronto for the National Library story.

50:13.923 --> 50:16.606
Either way, I'll be working on that as a biblio piece.

50:16.626 --> 50:19.810
I saw Richard Landon last night at the Groydia Club dinner.

50:21.071 --> 50:22.593
And so I'm doing that as the next one.

50:28.520 --> 50:37.310
So we'll bring in Toronto, Michigan, Stanford, Berkeley, Illinois when I go out there.

50:38.731 --> 50:41.955
Let's not forget that school in Monterey.

50:42.948 --> 50:51.742
that was planned without a library, and that I found down in Florida.

50:53.324 --> 50:54.826
Brand new university just opened in 1997.

50:54.847 --> 50:59.213
They outsourced the library.

50:59.774 --> 51:07.386
And Richard Landon, who told me about York University, that when it was established they went and bought books from two bookstores.

51:07.518 --> 51:16.868
And Roger Stoddard, who told me how the fellow who did the job at UMass basically built the library and he's very impressed with it.

51:19.591 --> 51:20.432
All this goes in there.

51:21.533 --> 51:27.180
All this goes in there and how they are part of the virtual revolution.

51:30.263 --> 51:36.630
Don't forget in the bibliography, the little case studies, whether or not it's done in paradigm shift or in the research libraries.

51:37.792 --> 51:50.665
The good things that are done with the computers, how you can do very synergistic things like get all these Blake materials from all over the world and make them available on one site.

51:52.287 --> 51:55.410
I want to talk to Tom Staley at the University of Texas.

51:57.012 --> 52:02.297
He did sound interested in talking to me about that and maybe I can talk to him.

52:02.935 --> 52:09.104
Send them an email and say, I'd like to give you a call, Tom, maybe we can chat.

52:10.186 --> 52:16.635
Because he has this Joyce stuff, and he has this great, great archive at HRC, which they don't make available.

52:16.675 --> 52:23.385
And then you have Ellen Dunlap, who says, we believe in making stuff available.

52:23.405 --> 52:24.126
Put it out there.

52:25.568 --> 52:27.290
Why are you hugging it?

52:27.311 --> 52:28.352
Why are you...

52:28.957 --> 52:35.345
denying people access to what's to be gained.

52:35.745 --> 52:40.831
So, yeah, that could all go into that institutional chapter.

52:41.272 --> 52:52.225
And I think right after the institutional chapter would be the place to do the Lloyd Coatsen story, because it is institutional.

52:54.127 --> 52:55.909
It's a very poignant story.

52:57.307 --> 52:59.409
And that's a discreet story.

53:01.992 --> 53:06.536
Or it could even be in the institutional package.

53:07.918 --> 53:08.658
We'll have to see.

53:08.819 --> 53:16.286
It all depends on the length, but I do believe Coatsen goes by himself about the length of the Shitey story.

53:19.229 --> 53:22.993
And I still have to go down to Princeton.

53:23.699 --> 53:26.143
I'm going to see Bill Joyce and Andrea Immel.

53:26.163 --> 53:31.953
I will try to have a discussion with Harold Shapiro, the president of Princeton.

53:31.973 --> 53:32.995
Put him on the record here.

53:36.140 --> 53:38.464
And that's a very discreet chapter.

53:39.365 --> 53:46.197
But you would bring in here, however, how difficult it has been

53:47.054 --> 53:51.481
for some institutions to deal with major donors who are making very serious demands.

53:51.561 --> 53:54.325
And now Yale, of course, turned down, what was it, $50 million.

53:54.345 --> 54:00.154
Harvard turned down some money because they are making demands on the curriculum.

54:02.638 --> 54:07.846
And I don't know if Cochin is making demands on the curriculum, but he's making demands on the university.

54:07.866 --> 54:09.849
And he's still adding to the collection right here.

54:10.030 --> 54:15.458
I'm told that there's plenty of tons of material out there now that he's just acquired.

54:15.742 --> 54:19.628
So I guess I have to talk to Colton again about this.

54:22.152 --> 54:23.334
So that's Colton right there.

54:25.457 --> 54:30.384
And I think the next one would be the national libraries.

54:31.846 --> 54:33.148
National libraries.

54:33.509 --> 54:37.275
And we have to get into the whole discussion of preservation.

54:39.057 --> 54:44.145
And maybe in that paradigm shift story, maybe that's the place to do it.

54:46.100 --> 54:58.678
virtual stuff, or we can do it, again, as the National Library says, as repositories of cultural heritage.

54:58.698 --> 55:10.875
You talk about Germany, you talk about France, you talk about England, Sweden, where we've been, Belgium if we get there, Spain if we get there, of course LC, Library of Congress,

55:12.290 --> 55:16.756
And we can talk about what these various countries are doing with preservation.

55:18.178 --> 55:23.386
Back to Cornell, don't forget that phrase, phase deterioration.

55:24.687 --> 55:26.730
Somebody else calls it planned deterioration.

55:31.277 --> 55:36.424
You know, I don't want to remember my plan to also

55:36.944 --> 55:38.006
at the Library of Congress.

55:38.066 --> 55:42.292
Maybe we start with the Library of Congress in that vault.

55:44.014 --> 55:49.022
In that vault, we have these papers, 18 documents.

55:49.102 --> 55:51.165
I guess they're secret, sort of secret.

55:52.947 --> 55:55.291
They're confidential, but I know what they are.

55:55.331 --> 55:56.172
I know most of them.

55:58.535 --> 56:03.763
And I had a long conversation with Gene Ashton of Columbia University last night at the Grosier Club.

56:03.883 --> 56:05.145
Very, very important.

56:06.172 --> 56:27.636
and we have to get this case, and maybe this is the place to do it, determining value, the difference between value and worth, value with regard to what something would go for in the marketplace, worth in terms of cultural worth, which in some instances can be inestimable.

56:29.178 --> 56:35.385
This lawyer, this fellow who was admitted to robbing these very rare and precious manuscripts from Columbia,

56:35.838 --> 56:39.722
I said, well, don't you have a Xerox of that letter if you have the content?

56:40.663 --> 56:43.045
Don't you have what's important?

56:43.145 --> 56:43.886
You haven't lost it.

56:45.227 --> 56:48.670
So why is it necessary to have the actual original document?

56:48.690 --> 56:50.952
Well, that's a great way to get into that.

56:51.032 --> 56:52.294
We talked about Archibald McLeish.

56:52.314 --> 56:53.415
I think I've already started this.

56:54.155 --> 57:04.225
How he moved material out of Washington to Fort Knox during World War II to protect

57:04.812 --> 57:15.227
these precious cultural artifacts which are of inestimable worth the value that you cannot calculate.

57:15.247 --> 57:21.497
And I guess I'm going to have to go down to the Federal District Courthouse in New York City and get the particulates of that case.

57:23.139 --> 57:26.744
I just have to work that in when I can.

57:26.804 --> 57:33.334
And I do have to go to Princeton, as I think I've already said, and do a spate of interviews there.

57:33.820 --> 57:37.784
We'll contrast the libraries, the British Library and the French Library.

57:39.165 --> 57:47.032
I think we've already conceived of how we're going to write that, Jacqueline Sanson, looking out on the Michelieu courtyard.

57:48.453 --> 57:55.640
We have David Bradbury in his office during the transition with his Mickey Mouse tie, holding books.

57:55.660 --> 58:01.785
And outside, the trucks are moving, trucks are moving, trucks are moving, 20,000 volumes a day.

58:02.069 --> 58:03.972
and Mickey Mouse holding books.

58:03.992 --> 58:06.977
Very interesting, Nick.

58:06.997 --> 58:08.800
Very interesting.

58:08.820 --> 58:22.061
The Sorcerer's Apprentice, the Walt Disney movie, Fantasia, where Mickey is carrying those buckets of water, and it gets totally out of hand, and he can't keep up with it.

58:22.802 --> 58:27.790
Isn't it interesting that David Bradbury has a tie to the day I'm there?

58:28.597 --> 58:32.881
a Mickey Mouse tie where Mickey Mouse is carrying books.

58:32.901 --> 58:33.582
Gee, that's great.

58:34.402 --> 58:35.724
That is really good.

58:37.385 --> 58:40.328
Before I forget, I was mentioning the Harvard Depository.

58:40.348 --> 58:41.229
You don't want to forget.

58:41.369 --> 58:47.054
You've got to put in the Harvard Medical School Primate Center, even if it's just a couple of graphs.

58:47.674 --> 58:48.335
It's cute.

58:48.355 --> 58:48.916
It's a good line.

58:49.516 --> 58:50.597
The problems with the water.

58:52.319 --> 58:53.480
Is it the monkeys or the books?

58:54.060 --> 58:56.983
The descent of man or the ascent of man?

58:57.638 --> 59:01.945
And so we're kind of getting there, aren't we, now?

59:01.985 --> 59:05.931
We're up to the national libraries.

59:06.191 --> 59:09.697
We've done the public libraries.

59:09.717 --> 59:11.039
We've done the institutional libraries.

59:11.059 --> 59:11.920
We've done the readers.

59:12.742 --> 59:13.703
We've done the canon.

59:13.723 --> 59:14.584
We've done Coton.

59:14.605 --> 59:16.487
We've done San Francisco Public Library.

59:17.189 --> 59:18.290
We've done the booksellers.

59:18.430 --> 59:23.258
We've done the libraries through history.

59:23.997 --> 59:53.987
Book Arts, Dart Hunter, Priscilla Javelas, Making Type, Bindings, Terry Belanger, Dart Hunter, Steinauer Press, people out in Western Massachusetts who still make books, that woman who I met, Ruth Rogers, the special collections librarian at Wellesley College.

59:54.997 --> 59:59.945
I might want to talk to Anne Anninger at the Houghton Library.

01:00:02.329 --> 01:00:03.991
You know, books as objects.

01:00:04.753 --> 01:00:06.255
Books still as objects.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:18.675
And that chapter will start... Let's start that chapter with Joe Jacobson at the MIT Media Lab.

01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:21.105
discussing the book of the future.

01:00:21.666 --> 01:00:28.400
I'm astounded by his youth that he's got this electronic book.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.244
And we have to give old Joe a call.

01:00:32.389 --> 01:00:36.758
And then I think we should talk, we could bring in here with Joe Jacobson your trip to Corpus.

01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:39.263
You talk to Mark.
