WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:03.770
It is running.

00:04.711 --> 00:06.493
We're talking to Dr. Sherwin Newland.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.837
And I love the fact that this book begins in a library.

00:09.918 --> 00:11.740
That's your first sentence.

00:11.780 --> 00:15.384
I am writing about books and books that influence people and change people.

00:15.424 --> 00:16.045
It's a wonderful library.

00:16.125 --> 00:21.792
In your very first sentence and in the introduction, this book is being written in a library.

00:23.173 --> 00:26.558
And this is kind of a book about books in a way, isn't it?

00:26.858 --> 00:27.378
That's right.

00:27.499 --> 00:30.442
It is really based on books.

00:30.622 --> 00:32.805
Every one of the people I write about is

00:33.325 --> 00:36.089
someone who's written a very important book.

00:36.750 --> 00:43.000
And, of course, the thrust of this book that I'm working on now has a tentative title, Every Book It's Reader.

00:43.821 --> 00:56.039
And when we were chatting on the telephone, you were mentioning that Leonardo, one of the paradoxical elements of his genius was that he said he was not influenced by books.

00:56.119 --> 00:56.660
Is that true?

00:56.700 --> 00:57.301
That's right.

00:57.321 --> 00:58.523
He called himself...

00:58.705 --> 01:10.845
An unlearned man, and he was called an unlearned man, using that term by everybody, because he had almost no Latin and he had less Greek.

01:10.865 --> 01:21.001
And he used to say that one of the reasons that he was able to discover some of the things was that he was not prejudiced by Galenic anatomy, for example.

01:21.021 --> 01:23.565
He had to learn everything on his own.

01:24.001 --> 01:32.753
and it's one of the reasons that he was able to look up at rock formation and looking at fossils, reasoned evolution.

01:32.974 --> 01:41.666
Essentially, he came right to the very edge of discovering, realizing evolution.

01:41.686 --> 01:51.780
He didn't quite say it, but what he did say is that nature creates her forms based on her experience.

01:52.756 --> 01:54.338
That devil is.

01:54.358 --> 01:55.579
There it is.

01:55.599 --> 01:55.999
Yeah.

01:56.119 --> 01:57.681
But he didn't go any further than that.

01:57.721 --> 02:05.769
Probably only a person of his extraordinary genius could get by without the, what, his fastest prologue.

02:05.789 --> 02:19.303
Yeah, you know, I have decided after working on a few biographies that every once in a while somebody appears on Earth whose intellect is beyond the range.

02:20.245 --> 02:26.333
of yours, mine, or even Johnny von Neumann.

02:26.353 --> 02:37.508
Einstein may have been such a person, I don't know, maybe Newton was such a person, but Leonardo was certainly such a person, you know, that the rules don't apply to people like him.

02:37.528 --> 02:41.033
They are not even the smartest people around.

02:41.073 --> 02:49.324
They transcend parents, and I don't know what it is that combines to make it happen, but I'm

02:49.658 --> 02:58.911
The more I learned about him, the more I'm convinced that his intellect was beyond the brightest intellects at almost any time.

02:58.931 --> 03:08.886
And from what you know of him, did, well, of course he says he didn't, he did not expose himself to other teachings there?

03:08.906 --> 03:09.767
No.

03:09.847 --> 03:17.338
There were some things he read in Italian translation, but the translations were bad, and he didn't read an awful lot.

03:17.358 --> 03:19.581
You know, he had books that he read.

03:19.831 --> 03:21.894
It is amazing, yeah.

03:21.914 --> 03:26.220
Because, you know, we try to figure out what Shakespeare's reading was.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.305
For instance, even though we don't have his library, we can see the evidence in his plays.

03:31.507 --> 03:39.398
And he certainly had to have... That's one of the reasons people often give significance for Shakespeare not being Shakespeare, you know, which is ridiculous.

03:39.438 --> 03:40.940
He never had a college education.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.582
How could anyone unlettered?

03:42.983 --> 03:45.265
possibly be so brilliant.

03:45.285 --> 03:48.849
And I say, look at Abraham Lincoln, you know, who never goes past the second grade.

03:50.791 --> 03:51.492
The Wright brothers.

03:51.532 --> 04:03.044
I went out to Dayton, Ohio a couple of weeks ago just to see the books that they, oh, I was really out there at Ohio State, but somebody invited me up to Dayton.

04:03.064 --> 04:05.747
These guys were not formally educated.

04:05.767 --> 04:10.071
One reason often given for their success is that they really weren't, you know,

04:10.456 --> 04:15.441
what's the word I'm looking for, polluted by earlier, by conventional plot, you know?

04:15.461 --> 04:21.728
And it's very interesting that on the 100th anniversary, somebody tried to replicate their, what they did and couldn't do it.

04:21.748 --> 04:23.810
They couldn't get the plane to fly.

04:23.890 --> 04:33.720
So there was really something, I think, about this genius that you just pursue on your own, and that maybe you don't need the prior writings.

04:33.740 --> 04:38.505
But I think for most of us, we really do have to have these texts

04:38.755 --> 04:55.310
Well, you know, now that we know this paradigm notion of the way science works, if you don't learn the paradigm for your time, and you're brilliant, and you apply yourself, you're going to make discoveries that are out of the paradigm.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.052
And that's essentially what he did.

05:00.135 --> 05:00.875
What a paradigm.

05:01.776 --> 05:01.936
Yeah.

05:02.517 --> 05:07.041
Well, the notion of the paradigm that we all learn

05:07.240 --> 05:36.218
particular way of looking at our observations because we're trained to do that and then somebody comes along every generation or so and he just looks at it in a completely different way and that's how great scientific achievement occurs and this was true of leonardo he just never learned the paradigm he never learned the way 15th century people saw evidence and he was not

05:36.957 --> 05:39.800
Well, he was not a religious person.

05:39.820 --> 05:44.624
I don't know if you would call him an atheist or an agnostic, because he would never admit to anything.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.746
The Church was, of course, so prevalent.

05:46.766 --> 05:50.950
But he refused to explain things on a supernatural basis.

05:51.030 --> 05:56.355
He didn't know what the supposed scientists were thinking.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.798
So he invented his own ways of doing things.

05:58.818 --> 05:59.118
It's wonderful.

05:59.138 --> 06:00.499
And it's just astonishing.

06:00.519 --> 06:02.561
He's almost aberrational, in a way.

06:02.681 --> 06:04.483
Well, that's what I mean.

06:04.970 --> 06:05.851
Once in a while.

06:05.971 --> 06:08.653
Maybe it's once in three generations.

06:08.673 --> 06:11.175
Someone's mind transcends anybody else's.

06:11.456 --> 06:13.397
And with this person, all bets are off.

06:13.638 --> 06:14.298
All bets are off.

06:14.318 --> 06:20.624
And studies like what I'm doing are totally irrelevant, I guess, to the grandest scheme of things.

06:20.644 --> 06:25.648
And it must also mean a particular kind of nurture.

06:25.668 --> 06:27.990
Those two things have to come together.

06:28.010 --> 06:33.255
I always think of Ted Williams, who was physically just right, had perfect reflexes.

06:33.691 --> 06:36.814
and had the personality that all he cared about was hitting his balls.

06:36.954 --> 06:37.835
And the eyes, too.

06:38.456 --> 06:39.477
Well, the reflexes.

06:39.777 --> 06:41.338
Everything was perfect.

06:41.939 --> 06:45.963
So now and then, such a person will come along.

06:46.363 --> 06:49.106
Ted Williams was my great living hero, I have to say.

06:49.166 --> 06:59.036
If anyone had asked me who I would like to be other than myself, it always would have been Ted Williams.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.318
Just wonderful.

07:01.687 --> 07:19.166
Do you think, do you subscribe to the theory that if somebody, and particularly in the sciences, works of fiction are works of fiction, and the unique work of the imagination, but works of science, if William Harvey doesn't come along and do the circulation of blood, for instance, someone else is going to do that.

07:19.287 --> 07:25.493
Yeah, I think always, always going to happen.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.935
Something is bound to happen.

07:27.235 --> 07:27.996
It's in the air.

07:28.437 --> 07:29.618
We're ready for it.

07:30.745 --> 07:36.875
a particularly capable person comes along and just takes the next step.

07:36.895 --> 07:45.188
Of course, that's mostly true today, although every once in a while someone still does something really strange.

07:45.408 --> 07:47.792
Like, I keep thinking of Barry Marshall.

07:48.515 --> 07:57.724
and his realization that you didn't get ulcers because of stress, you got ulcer because you had helicobacter pylori in your stomach.

07:57.744 --> 08:01.907
And, you know, for years and years people laughed at him, and he turned out to be right.

08:02.007 --> 08:05.030
So now if you've got an ulcer, they put you on antibiotics.

08:05.070 --> 08:17.762
But that's one example of one person who persisted and persisted and persisted, and that probably would not have been discovered for a very long time, another 25 years or so.

08:18.569 --> 08:23.634
In the sciences, are there any books that are canonical?

08:23.794 --> 08:33.464
I mean, obviously, the ones that you're writing about in this... Well, I can't talk about the sciences, because all I know really is medicine.

08:33.484 --> 08:34.264
Oh, medicine.

08:34.845 --> 08:41.712
There's no question that the Vesalius book, the Humanity Corporis Fabrica, is canonical.

08:41.832 --> 08:46.336
There's no question that Harvey's De Mochi Cordes is canonical.

08:47.537 --> 08:48.238
After that,

08:50.024 --> 08:51.206
They're prominent folks.

08:52.108 --> 09:00.121
You can't say that anything Hippocrates wrote is canonical because we don't know what Hippocrates wrote.

09:01.644 --> 09:09.197
I suppose you can say what Galen wrote is canonical in the sense that it affected medicine.

09:09.683 --> 09:15.091
from the second century right up until about the 17th was essentially the Bible.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.495
But as you point out here, almost in a negative way.

09:17.815 --> 09:19.117
It was in a negative way.

09:19.137 --> 09:31.396
You know, it held, that was the paradigm that Leonardo never learned and that had to be broken shortly after Leonardo by the Salius.

09:31.416 --> 09:38.847
To me, the really, the books that really changed things were, of course,

09:39.923 --> 09:50.639
the many Hippocratic writings, even though it wasn't Hippocrates, Galen, the Vesalius, the Harvey, and the Morgane.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.685
The Morgane had a profound effect on everybody.

09:54.705 --> 09:57.529
That just changed the medicine dramatically.

09:57.549 --> 09:59.832
I think those are the really big things.

09:59.852 --> 10:08.665
And what I didn't realize until I, and I've handled the Vesalius, I think, was I had to handle Dr. Haskell Norman's, you know, which is really...

10:08.780 --> 10:10.723
I'm sure you're the same way.

10:10.763 --> 10:14.288
There is something you can't express when you handle a book like this.

10:14.729 --> 10:20.798
And this, he suggested, was the presentation copy to the patron, you know, to the emperor.

10:20.818 --> 10:21.398
Charles.

10:21.499 --> 10:22.280
Charles, right.

10:23.001 --> 10:29.110
But I don't think I realized, as you point out here, that this was the first true textbook.

10:29.230 --> 10:36.120
When we have textbooks, really the whole concept of a textbook, a teaching book,

10:36.472 --> 10:39.595
really, really begins with that particular body.

10:40.076 --> 10:44.921
Yeah, it's a landmark in pedagogy, in addition to being a landmark in anatomy.

10:46.422 --> 11:00.577
And in a way, it's a landmark in the history of art, too, because art was never the same after that time, after 1528, 1543.

11:02.439 --> 11:06.343
Is illustration, in that particular instance, essential to the text?

11:07.724 --> 11:11.309
Some people say, is the text really essential to the illustrations?

11:11.329 --> 11:12.130
So it's the other way around.

11:12.210 --> 11:16.796
Yeah, I think the illustrations are the core of that book.

11:16.816 --> 11:26.249
And the truth is that you can get copies of the illustrations, but it's kind of hard to get copies of the text.

11:26.269 --> 11:36.063
I've got a facsimile copy upstairs of the Vesalius that was done from a copy made with the original place, the Dutch.

11:36.183 --> 11:36.263
Wow.

11:36.682 --> 11:44.633
Just before World War II, the Dutch, I can't remember who the press was, got a hold of the original plates.

11:44.813 --> 11:46.956
The plates survived, is what astonishes me.

11:46.976 --> 11:51.462
Well, they only survived until they went back to Munich, and American ball was destroyed.

11:51.482 --> 11:52.163
Yeah, but wow.

11:52.664 --> 11:53.505
That's unbelievable.

11:53.525 --> 11:54.706
I did not know that.

11:54.727 --> 11:58.251
Normally, plates, as you know, plates very rarely survive.

11:58.291 --> 12:02.036
You can't find a single Winslow Homer plate, for instance.

12:02.217 --> 12:02.637
Really?

12:02.657 --> 12:03.879
He's just in the 19th century.

12:03.899 --> 12:04.680
There might be one.

12:05.032 --> 12:10.880
especially if they're wood engravings, because they would just do them again, you know, scrape them down and use them again.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.124
So you have a copy that's pulled from the original plate?

12:14.164 --> 12:14.905
That's pretty good.

12:15.165 --> 12:15.446
Yeah.

12:16.127 --> 12:21.013
And not colored, I hope, as a company.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.215
Yeah.

12:22.235 --> 12:22.435
Yeah.

12:22.755 --> 12:26.280
Are there books we talk about?

12:26.935 --> 12:33.322
I found very interesting in reading about you and learning as much as I could that English is not your first language.

12:33.782 --> 12:36.145
No, I'm speaking English.

12:36.165 --> 12:40.229
But I got pretty good in English very fast.

12:40.249 --> 12:46.195
Actually, by the time I started in kindergarten, I could almost say everything.

12:46.255 --> 12:49.719
I had some problems, but I could do very well.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.842
One interview I read with you

12:53.227 --> 12:55.089
You credited the King James Bible.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.011
Oh, yeah.

12:56.031 --> 12:57.653
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that.

12:57.993 --> 13:08.567
Well, you know, I had been reading the Bible because I was brought up in an Orthodox household and spent a lot of time in synagogues, and we were reading a piece of the Bible every week.

13:09.268 --> 13:12.172
But I'd read it in the translations that are there.

13:12.632 --> 13:16.457
But then I went to college, and I decided I would take a course in the Bible.

13:16.517 --> 13:18.440
I didn't know the New Testament at all.

13:19.601 --> 13:21.063
So I took a year's course.

13:21.304 --> 13:23.166
The first semester was...

13:23.602 --> 13:27.808
what people like to call the Old Testament, and the second semester was the New.

13:28.649 --> 13:34.917
And, of course, it was the King James Version, and the Bible was treated as literature in that course.

13:34.977 --> 13:37.681
That's why we were taking it.

13:37.701 --> 13:43.849
And it opened my eyes in ways that I had never imagined before.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.433
It's the cadences.

13:46.453 --> 13:46.753
It's the sound.

13:46.773 --> 13:51.820
You know, biblical Hebrew, the Old Testament, only had

13:53.437 --> 13:56.882
something like 5,000 words.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.624
That's all they're worth.

13:59.445 --> 14:05.934
French has 150,000 words.

14:05.954 --> 14:16.288
And so the language is so spare, but the way they translated it, you can hear it ringing in your head when you read it.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.795
And if you read it out loud, poetry, it's all poetry.

14:20.815 --> 14:24.981
Well, people forget the Psalms really are poetry, because they were songs.

14:26.403 --> 14:33.373
So you get that rhythm in your head, and it never leaves you.

14:33.393 --> 14:45.010
And when I first started writing, including that, I realized after a while that the reason that I enjoyed reading my own writing was not

14:45.445 --> 14:54.435
the language so much as it was the sound of it, and the sound of it really was from the King James Version.

14:54.596 --> 15:02.384
Was it 90 or 95 percent of King James actually comes from Tyndale, the Tyndale Bible, which is some very interesting books.

15:02.825 --> 15:08.972
That's pretty well understood, but I mean, obviously, that committee that did the King James Bible kind of

15:09.205 --> 15:20.601
polished it up, but the first real great English translation, and he was hounded down, you know, and burned to death, and it's amazing.

15:20.621 --> 15:29.894
So it was a book, it was a biography of Tim Dale published, I think, by either Yale or Oxford a couple of years ago, very, very fascinating book.

15:29.914 --> 15:37.204
But it is interesting also that you're learning English, you're reading the Bible, obviously, through translation, but an English text

15:37.589 --> 15:39.872
And your first language is Yiddish.

15:40.613 --> 15:45.821
And so you, were you particularly religious growing up, or were you reading it?

15:45.841 --> 15:46.161
Oh, yeah.

15:46.181 --> 15:58.940
I was religious until I fell apart in my late thirties, and began to realize that my religion was obsessional neurosis.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.802
It was nuts.

16:00.862 --> 16:04.187
And that was the end of that.

16:05.146 --> 16:18.125
There's a great line in here, and you quote a former colleague of yours, that one should never forget that the science, distinguishing between the science of medicine and the art of medicine.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.711
I wonder if you could talk to me a little bit about what you mean by that.

16:21.851 --> 16:25.656
Yeah, well, medicine, of course, is never going to be a science.

16:25.676 --> 16:28.060
It's an art that uses science.

16:28.521 --> 16:32.166
And one of the reasons that I think of it as an art

16:32.568 --> 17:02.322
is not just because Hippocrates and the Greeks referred to it as the art, but because ultimately it is the expression of your scientific knowledge, the wisdom that you acquire by living on this earth, and by your reading and by your previous experiences, to the illness, I deliberately say illness and not disease, to the illness of one individual.

17:02.740 --> 17:10.754
which by its very nature has to be distinctive to that individual so that nobody in history has ever had that illness.

17:10.774 --> 17:23.837
Now, they may have the same disease, but not the same illness, because illness is the way disease influences the person who has it.

17:23.857 --> 17:28.225
So if you take a disease, let's say cancer of the doll bladder,

17:29.690 --> 17:42.885
The person who has cancer, the gallbladder, responds to it emotionally, responds to it physiologically, because everybody's physiological response to the pathology is different.

17:42.905 --> 17:45.248
So that everybody who comes to you is going to be unique.

17:47.971 --> 17:56.220
And you use all of your training, all of your knowledge, all of your life experiences to understand how that person

17:56.926 --> 18:10.503
is living with this disease, so that when you decide on how you will approach the therapy for that disease, you may decide that the standard approach is just right.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.727
You may decide that you have to modify it in some way.

18:13.747 --> 18:22.358
You may decide, for example, that at this particular stage of the disease, no therapy is appropriate.

18:22.658 --> 18:25.482
So what you're really doing is

18:25.900 --> 18:31.126
you are taking everything and putting it into the crucible of your own mind, all of your impressions.

18:32.328 --> 18:46.424
And you're also recognizing that it's an ongoing process, that just because you saw this fellow on a given date doesn't mean that his relation to the disease and your understanding of it remains static.

18:46.565 --> 18:50.029
It keeps evolving all the time you're treating that person.

18:50.049 --> 18:55.435
So with so many elements entering into it, my subjectivity,

18:56.090 --> 19:00.695
my objectivity, his subjectivity, his objectivity.

19:00.795 --> 19:03.018
How can you call it a science?

19:03.038 --> 19:06.061
Science, by definition, is reproducible.

19:07.683 --> 19:12.809
It should look the same to you as it does to me, and it never will.

19:12.969 --> 19:24.021
One of the elements in treatment that has really never been studied is the doctor's psychological response to his patients.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.619
I've been around a long time.

19:26.639 --> 19:27.721
You've even called me sir.

19:28.061 --> 19:30.445
So I've been around a long time.

19:30.465 --> 19:48.431
And I'm absolutely convinced that even when a surgeon goes into an operating room, the decisions that he makes while he's operating, because we're constantly making decisions as you're working, are influenced by certain needs that he has.

19:49.112 --> 19:52.236
And they're even influenced by transient events.

19:52.958 --> 20:14.607
I write about that in one of the books, I think it's The Mysteries Within, that you may have met a colleague in the corridor or in the scrub room, and he may have said something to you that influences your mood about this disease on that day, and you may do something different.

20:14.968 --> 20:20.535
You may look up and realize your assistant is not the assistant you want,

20:20.819 --> 20:25.284
and he's someone not quite as skilled as you would want.

20:25.445 --> 20:27.227
That will influence your decision.

20:27.247 --> 20:30.571
You want to be more conservative, you think, or to be more aggressive?

20:30.791 --> 20:32.213
You want to be more conservative?

20:32.853 --> 20:33.054
Yeah.

20:34.235 --> 20:41.924
Especially in teaching hospitals now, where the assistant is doing a lot of the technical work, it may be that way.

20:41.944 --> 20:47.451
You may be influenced by an attack of

20:48.005 --> 20:53.151
excess gastric acidity, as the commercials call it, that you had the night before.

20:53.171 --> 20:56.195
There are so many things that influence how you feel.

20:56.235 --> 21:07.048
And I'm even convinced, based on my own experience and what I've seen in many, many mortality and morbidity conferences, you're influenced by how you feel about that guy.

21:07.068 --> 21:08.029
We don't love them all.

21:08.890 --> 21:09.791
Some we don't like.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.637
And I've got a feeling that unconsciously some of us make decisions

21:14.937 --> 21:18.080
or maybe we're not quite as meticulous as some people.

21:18.681 --> 21:20.283
That's quite an admission.

21:20.423 --> 21:23.466
I'm very candid.

21:23.486 --> 21:24.307
Oh, I'm sure of it.

21:24.647 --> 21:25.548
As I say, I've written a bit.

21:25.568 --> 21:30.273
I think it applies in every walk of every profession.

21:30.333 --> 21:38.022
I know, interviewing hundreds of people over the years, people like yourself who I like and admire, you're going to respond differently.

21:38.102 --> 21:42.126
Even when it comes to the interview, when it comes to writing the text that you write,

21:42.325 --> 21:49.134
I mean, it's got to have, these factors have to have some influence in the product.

21:49.194 --> 21:54.821
And you're saying that it also applies in the operating room.

21:55.181 --> 22:09.719
As something as apparently distanced as that, even your relationship with the anesthesiologist assigned to you that day influences decisions, small decisions that you're making during the course of the procedure.

22:10.140 --> 22:10.240
Yeah.

22:10.388 --> 22:14.393
And that's never been studied, and it's never really been talked about at all.

22:14.413 --> 22:26.049
And it's the human element that is, you know, we're all people, subjects of human emotions, and you're not a machine up there doing this.

22:26.069 --> 22:27.131
Very, very interesting.

22:27.151 --> 22:29.955
Are you familiar with the work that Robert Coles has done at Harvard?

22:29.975 --> 22:32.238
A little bit.

22:32.298 --> 22:38.286
But he does really try to, especially with training young medical students,

22:39.211 --> 22:45.941
To make them, he believes that, and you say the same thing, you become a better physician when you become a better listener.

22:46.342 --> 23:01.865
And part of what he wants to do with the storytelling and teaching literature in the classroom is that narrative makes an appreciation for narrative and storytelling makes for a better physician.

23:01.985 --> 23:03.447
Is this something that...

23:04.051 --> 23:10.261
Have you given any thought to the power of... Yeah, well, of course, there are two aspects to that.

23:10.821 --> 23:18.253
One is that the taking and recording of history is a lost art.

23:18.894 --> 23:25.024
It's interesting to me that the emphasis on narrative is relatively new, maybe the last ten years.

23:25.624 --> 23:32.455
And it comes up just at the time that medicine has become so technological

23:32.873 --> 23:41.283
that these kids feel, students, residents, people in training, young doctors, that they can find out everything they know by ordering the right test.

23:42.224 --> 23:55.720
I used to say that in my day, Dr. Cole's day, of course he's a psychiatrist, but clinical physicians, we considered ourselves masters of history taking and of the physical exam.

23:56.981 --> 23:58.984
Today, kids are masters of the menu.

24:00.045 --> 24:01.767
They see a patient, he has a complaint,

24:02.590 --> 24:11.222
An algorithm goes through this, this, this, this, and depending on what that shows me, I go to this, this, this, and I'm going to get a completely objectified diagnosis.

24:12.043 --> 24:22.057
So the art of history taking has lost its value to these people, young people, and they don't realize how important it is.

24:22.458 --> 24:31.450
So there's that aspect, which is the taking of the narrative, allowing the patient, guiding the patient,

24:31.902 --> 24:34.386
so that a real narrative emerges.

24:35.027 --> 24:36.269
And listening?

24:36.449 --> 24:38.772
Well, yeah, listening.

24:38.933 --> 24:50.009
And then there's the other aspect of it, which is recording as a narrative, instead of just short bursts, because you've got ten lines on the chart to fill out.

24:51.972 --> 24:59.243
I used to say, and I still do, that it's a little bit like producing a play.

25:00.978 --> 25:29.770
When you have finished taking a history and recording it, the person reading that history ought to be able to visualize in his mind everything about that patient, including his origins, the origins of his symptoms, including the image of him first doubling up with pain, or the image of him just sort of becoming aware of something not right.

25:30.188 --> 25:36.597
You know, Dickens, Dickens' only advice to writers was, make them see it.

25:36.617 --> 25:44.910
And that's why I think narrative is so important, that you should be able, by the time you've recorded that history, to make them see it.

25:47.073 --> 25:48.234
Somebody comes in with pain.

25:48.675 --> 25:59.571
And it's very important to know, did the pain start slowly, rapidly, suddenly?

26:00.395 --> 26:01.516
or with immediacy.

26:02.637 --> 26:26.861
Some diseases are characterized as if you're shot, you know, you have an ulcer, you're fine, just sitting there reading a book, there's that, which is very different than sitting there in over a five-minute period realizing that there's terrible pain, which is very different than over the course of days and days, gradually becoming aware of something, and then, you know, there it is.

26:27.342 --> 26:29.524
And just that sort of narrative

26:30.314 --> 26:32.858
can lead you to the diagnosis.

26:32.878 --> 26:39.948
Because what you do is you replay in your mind what could have been causing that, and you begin to see it.

26:39.968 --> 26:45.336
First you see it grossly, and then gradually you're seeing it microscopically.

26:45.376 --> 26:59.157
The most important difference between Western medicine, scientific medicine, and any other form of healing that has ever existed

27:00.773 --> 27:04.879
can be expressed with that one word, to see.

27:04.899 --> 27:13.391
We demand to know exactly what's happening so that in our mind's eye we can visualize it.

27:13.411 --> 27:22.104
If you take Ayurvedic medicine, Chinese medicine, tribal South American, various tribes, they have these various concepts.

27:22.584 --> 27:23.766
Vague things go wrong.

27:23.786 --> 27:25.068
There are imbalances.

27:25.429 --> 27:27.872
The whole body is sick.

27:27.892 --> 27:29.194
It's not good enough for us.

27:30.980 --> 27:38.651
If I see a kid with right lower quadrant of pain, any Western physician should do this.

27:39.953 --> 27:47.343
I should be able to visualize what his appendix looks like at the time that he comes to see me.

27:47.363 --> 27:55.595
That used to be the great game predicting, not whether the kid had appendicitis or not, because we were almost always right, but what that appendix was going to look like.

27:56.697 --> 28:00.582
The degree of inflammation, how advanced the disease process had come,

28:00.950 --> 28:07.020
and even the anatomical position of the appendix in relation to the intestine.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.201
So you always want to see.

28:09.083 --> 28:13.590
And now that we're working on the molecular level, we want to see.

28:14.371 --> 28:28.273
We want to be able to draw pictures of how those molecules are interacting and how various ions are going through channels in the membrane, this sort of thing.

28:28.608 --> 28:33.492
You wrote a small little piece for the National Book Foundation on the book, the first book that moved you on.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.653
It was a children's book.

28:34.674 --> 28:35.314
I'll show you.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.455
And you still have it.

28:36.555 --> 28:37.596
Oh, I don't have that book.

28:37.616 --> 28:40.399
I have my first non-fiction essay downstairs.

28:40.439 --> 28:42.721
Yeah, I have the game.

28:45.583 --> 28:54.972
But tell me a little bit about your reading, if you might, and how that helped shape your life.

28:55.873 --> 28:57.214
Well, you know, you take a kid.

28:57.903 --> 29:03.651
It comes from a home where other language is spoken.

29:03.671 --> 29:11.843
And early on, can I give you a copy of an essay to take with you that I wrote about this?

29:11.863 --> 29:12.044
Yes.

29:12.564 --> 29:14.567
You can quote it, in fact.

29:14.828 --> 29:17.051
Well, I'll give it to you.

29:17.311 --> 29:19.635
I just wrote it about three weeks ago.

29:19.935 --> 29:23.320
We're putting together, Glenn is putting together

29:23.924 --> 29:26.386
the essays I've been writing over the last 10 years.

29:26.506 --> 29:28.168
He's got a couple of books worth of it.

29:28.969 --> 29:32.492
And I had given a talk when I won the National Book Award.

29:32.512 --> 29:35.675
All three winners came to the New York Public Library.

29:35.715 --> 29:36.676
We gave a talk.

29:36.696 --> 29:38.717
And I gave a talk about exactly this.

29:39.258 --> 29:41.740
My love for the language.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.561
And I never wrote it.

29:42.921 --> 29:46.905
And he said to me, you know, we've got to have that in the book.

29:46.925 --> 29:47.786
Where's the essay?

29:47.866 --> 29:48.506
I never wrote it.

29:48.606 --> 29:50.368
So he said, well, damn it, write it.

29:50.468 --> 29:52.750
He said, you should write it.

29:53.152 --> 29:55.114
So I wrote it, and I just did it, too.

29:55.134 --> 29:58.298
Because I had given the talk from little pieces.

29:58.719 --> 29:59.820
Did they tape it?

29:59.840 --> 30:00.340
They should have.

30:00.360 --> 30:00.981
I don't know.

30:01.001 --> 30:02.343
You probably could have gotten the tape.

30:02.363 --> 30:03.825
It makes no difference, but I've got this guy.

30:04.085 --> 30:09.531
You know, I embellished it because I added things that in a 15-minute talk you can't get.

30:09.551 --> 30:19.463
But it essentially tells about a kid who quickly realizes that the key to America is the life.

30:20.641 --> 30:28.290
They're wearing this little apartment in the Bronx, you know, four little apartments, seven people living in these four little rooms.

30:28.310 --> 30:31.894
And out there is this whole amazing world.

30:33.836 --> 30:41.986
You know, in Lost in America, I talk about taking long walks with my parents in the evening.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.488
There's this great world.

30:43.528 --> 30:45.050
How do you get into this world?

30:45.770 --> 30:49.635
And then you go to school, and these astonishing,

30:49.902 --> 30:51.303
You must have had teachers like that.

30:51.323 --> 30:55.367
They're all Irish Catholic spinsters.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.048
And this was their country.

30:57.809 --> 31:06.616
And they, without saying it in so many words, were transmitting to us, damn it, it's going to be your country, too!

31:06.636 --> 31:16.064
You know, you can't just go back to your immigrant assholes and keep speaking Yiddish or Italian or Greek.

31:16.084 --> 31:19.487
We had a couple of Greek kids.

31:20.530 --> 31:24.814
Aristides Gazetis was the one I remember so well.

31:25.735 --> 31:42.231
Oh, yeah, one of my closest friends, Tommy Tappas, or as he was known among his Greek friends, Demacio Papawana, you know, or Czech or whatever, German, whatever they were speaking, you can't, you know, you can go home and do that.

31:42.832 --> 31:46.656
But when you're in this world of ours, you've got to do it by our rules.

31:46.676 --> 31:47.837
You've got to do this poetry.

31:48.543 --> 31:50.667
You've got to read these books we tell you about.

31:50.687 --> 31:53.131
You've got to get a library card."

31:53.151 --> 31:57.619
And they opened this up to us and said, you know, it's ours.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.162
It's got to be yours.

31:59.623 --> 32:07.256
And I owe them everything I ever became, because I became an omnivorous reader.

32:07.276 --> 32:08.939
Fiction as well as non-fiction?

32:08.959 --> 32:09.580
At that age?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.243
At that age, every time.

32:11.712 --> 32:14.215
Today you're basically a non-fiction reader, right?

32:14.235 --> 32:19.181
I'm basically a non-fiction reader, but, you know, I did a project about three years ago.

32:20.443 --> 32:21.624
You don't mind if I take my glasses?

32:21.644 --> 32:21.864
No, no, no.

32:21.884 --> 32:23.126
Because I'm as vain as anybody.

32:23.887 --> 32:24.227
More so.

32:25.068 --> 32:30.175
Harold Bloom writes this great book, How to Read It.

32:30.315 --> 32:35.681
In the book, somewhere it says, I don't believe this, but this is what he says in the book.

32:37.103 --> 32:38.665
He says, every year,

32:39.674 --> 32:45.226
Until a few years ago, I used to read Pickwick papers.

32:45.607 --> 32:47.631
So he's got to read Pickwick papers 30, 40 times.

32:47.651 --> 32:57.733
And I thought to myself, if Harold Bloom can read Pickwick papers every year for 30 or 40 years, I can read it once.

32:58.051 --> 33:02.478
You know, actually we had it in the paperback in the house, Sarah had a copy, and I read it.

33:02.498 --> 33:05.643
And by the second chapter, I was hooked.

33:05.663 --> 33:07.767
So I just read one Dickens after the other.

33:07.787 --> 33:11.773
You know, I read about ten of them, or maybe a dozen of them.

33:12.013 --> 33:14.658
And then I decided I'll have a little moratorium for six months.

33:14.678 --> 33:17.963
But it was two years ago, so I... But this was on the strength of Harold Bloom.

33:17.983 --> 33:18.985
Yeah, Harold Bloom.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.427
Because I got married.

33:20.447 --> 33:23.552
And you know, like you, I do a lot of traveling, and...

33:23.718 --> 33:25.080
They're all in paperback.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.202
Take them with me.

33:27.363 --> 33:29.085
I read them everywhere I go.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.868
So, you know, I've done that.

33:31.888 --> 33:43.203
The recent NEA report, if you've seen that, how they said the profound decline in reading among Americans, but they say literary reading.

33:44.244 --> 33:50.772
So, therefore, people who read nonfiction books like yours or like mine or David McCullers or whatever,

33:50.988 --> 33:51.989
don't count.

33:52.009 --> 33:52.510
That's right.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.852
Which I think is ridiculous.

33:54.212 --> 33:54.973
Of course.

33:54.993 --> 33:55.734
If I may say so.

33:55.774 --> 34:16.540
So my wife, who reads nothing but nonfiction, but reads, you know, as many books as I do, and reads biographies and even flags them for me and points out things that I really ought to be alert to, she doesn't count, but someone who reads, say, exclusively Harlequin Romances or Daniel Steele, that person does count.

34:17.762 --> 34:20.505
So I say there's a flaw in that...

34:21.042 --> 34:27.048
Especially now, because every book that gets reviewed at the times is a political book.

34:27.068 --> 34:29.030
Yeah, which is unfortunate, I think.

34:29.050 --> 34:30.552
Oh, it's terrible.

34:30.572 --> 34:32.654
Because these are just ephemeral little things anyway.

34:32.774 --> 34:36.878
But I am pleased to see that they'll be doing more nonfiction.

34:37.499 --> 34:39.821
I really don't want to take up too much of your time.

34:39.841 --> 34:41.863
I know you've got it wherever you want to go.

34:41.963 --> 34:45.987
I really did want to talk about the things that we've touched on.

34:46.388 --> 35:05.595
I've got your books, and if it seems like I'm not asking a lot of obvious questions, it's because there has been a lot written on you, which I have access to, and there's no need to go over material, and that you and I have had two previous interviews, by the way, over the years, and I have those transcripts to draw from, so that I don't really know.

35:05.980 --> 35:08.864
Yeah, we did one in person and one on the telephone, believe me.

35:09.065 --> 35:09.806
Oh, yeah.

35:09.826 --> 35:11.588
The one in person we did in Boston, actually.

35:11.608 --> 35:19.279
Yeah, we did it for the How We Die book and the one that followed How We Live, I guess.

35:19.720 --> 35:24.567
That's another title that you changed it.

35:24.587 --> 35:29.895
What would you say was the driving motivation?

35:30.652 --> 35:35.940
in you to influence you to become a writer about your craft.

35:36.020 --> 35:40.246
It's not a craft, your art, your profession, however you wish to describe it.

35:41.728 --> 35:43.772
Well, it sort of happened.

35:46.636 --> 35:52.044
I would like to say something really lofty at this moment, but I can't.

35:52.384 --> 35:55.789
I fell into this by pure good luck.

35:56.250 --> 35:59.595
What actually happened was that

36:00.115 --> 36:17.117
being interested in medical history, of course, and reading so much medical history, I was contacted by the fellow who started the Classics of Medicine Library, Les Adams.

36:17.578 --> 36:29.734
He had been, Les Adams had been using our books at the Medical Historical Library to make facsimile copies of these classics.

36:30.119 --> 36:37.687
He always had questions, and after a while, they started referring his questions to me.

36:38.968 --> 36:42.392
And he asked me if I would join the board of the Classics of Medicine Library.

36:44.114 --> 36:49.700
And then he asked me to write a few essays to go with the books that he was selling.

36:52.703 --> 36:53.784
And they were long essays.

36:53.824 --> 36:56.447
They were 25-page essays.

36:57.203 --> 36:58.024
And I did that.

36:58.224 --> 37:03.529
And then he started a Classics of Surgery library and asked if I would write an essay for every book.

37:03.569 --> 37:07.033
And, you know, I was in the middle of a busy practice.

37:07.053 --> 37:09.735
And I said that I would like to do it.

37:09.835 --> 37:10.376
So I did it.

37:10.856 --> 37:12.338
And I had a bunch of them.

37:13.699 --> 37:21.247
Well, I wrote, if I'm saying too much, it's always better to have more.

37:21.327 --> 37:21.667
Yeah.

37:22.448 --> 37:26.772
I wrote an essay on Ignaz Semmelweis, the hand-washing guy.

37:27.325 --> 37:33.494
in 1977 for the Journal of History of Medicine and Allied Sciences.

37:33.514 --> 37:41.406
And it presented a theory of why he did the things he did that was quite different than what historians have been saying.

37:41.567 --> 37:47.496
And it created a bit of a sensation in the community of historians.

37:48.357 --> 37:51.662
So I was asked to give a talk at Columbia about it.

37:52.688 --> 37:56.672
And in the audience was a fellow from the Princeton University Press.

37:56.873 --> 38:00.116
And he contacted me and said, you've got to write a book for us about Semmelweis.

38:00.637 --> 38:03.079
Well, I'm in the middle of this busy surgical practice.

38:03.179 --> 38:07.384
I would have to take a lot of time to write this book.

38:07.404 --> 38:19.557
And I thought to myself that if I'm going to write a book on Semmelweis, I want to write it for a trade press, because clearly they're going to give me an advance, and I can do this.

38:20.161 --> 38:30.454
Sarah, who is an actor, had a close friend named Maria Tucci, who was also an actor, a very successful New York stage actor, actually.

38:30.514 --> 38:37.544
And Maria was married to Bob Gottlieb, who was the president of Knopf.

38:38.024 --> 38:38.965
And I had met Bob.

38:39.146 --> 38:41.949
You know, we sort of schmoozed around together.

38:42.770 --> 38:46.035
So I called him and I said, Bob, they want me to write this book.

38:46.455 --> 38:47.957
I really want to write it for you.

38:48.545 --> 38:50.848
And he said, how do I know you can write a book?

38:50.908 --> 38:52.650
How do I know you can sustain a book?

38:53.151 --> 38:53.852
I said, you don't.

38:54.873 --> 38:56.756
He said, well, write me a few chapters.

38:57.497 --> 39:02.924
Well, you know, and I know, if you write chapters, you've got to start doing an awful lot of research.

39:03.064 --> 39:04.286
You've got to organize it.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.128
I didn't want to do it.

39:06.208 --> 39:07.130
And I didn't do it.

39:07.150 --> 39:08.632
This was about 78.

39:11.135 --> 39:14.019
Well, but there I am writing all these essays for Les Adams.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.442
And finally, in 86,

39:17.131 --> 39:22.238
I sent him a whole bunch of essays, and one of them was the Summer Wars essay, and I said, how about this?

39:23.019 --> 39:24.260
Is this going to be a book?

39:24.280 --> 39:27.505
Well, he called me up and he said, oh my God, yes.

39:27.525 --> 39:28.346
And it was Doctors.

39:28.766 --> 39:29.467
Isn't that crazy?

39:29.487 --> 39:34.274
So we published Doctors, and halfway through it, he was my editor.

39:34.594 --> 39:38.059
He left to become the editor of the New Yorker, so they saw him.

39:38.079 --> 39:39.901
You should have been mentioned here, he's just left.

39:39.941 --> 39:40.922
He had just left.

39:40.942 --> 39:44.387
Yeah, he had just left.

39:44.907 --> 39:46.810
I had another very good editor.

39:46.870 --> 39:48.452
The book was published.

39:48.472 --> 39:52.698
In those days, the Book of the Month Club had a selection and an alternate selection.

39:52.718 --> 39:53.379
That's all I had.

39:53.399 --> 39:57.205
And they chose it as the alternate selection for that month.

39:57.465 --> 40:00.549
And it got these amazing reviews that soon started selling.

40:00.569 --> 40:02.552
So I started feeling like I was a writer.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.037
Well, this was 88.

40:06.157 --> 40:13.648
In 89, Gottlieb asked me to write an article on Hard Train Plantation for the New Yorker, which I did.

40:14.354 --> 40:19.018
Well, I didn't know that The New Yorker is read by everybody in publishing.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.783
So one day the phone rings.

40:23.803 --> 40:26.065
It was 92.

40:27.226 --> 40:29.749
And some guy on the other end says, you don't know me.

40:29.829 --> 40:36.795
My name is Glenn Hartley, and I'm an agent in New York, and I've got a great idea for a book.

40:36.815 --> 40:38.137
And I never told you this story.

40:38.177 --> 40:38.697
Yes, you have.

40:38.757 --> 40:40.179
I love hearing it again.

40:40.599 --> 40:40.699
Yeah.

40:41.033 --> 40:44.238
And the book, I've even got a title that's called How We Die.

40:44.278 --> 40:46.681
I'm smiling because that's Glenn.

40:46.701 --> 40:47.583
That's Glenn.

40:47.603 --> 40:49.666
That's what he does, yeah.

40:49.686 --> 40:59.460
So I had talked to several editors in New York looking for someone to write this book, and your name keeps coming up, so would you be willing to do it?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.183
At first I said I wasn't.

41:02.024 --> 41:08.053
I had actually been interested in writing, and John Irving, who I had worked with on his

41:09.957 --> 41:15.864
had recommended his agent, Peter something.

41:16.284 --> 41:19.448
Anyway, I said, you know, I have an agent.

41:19.628 --> 41:21.210
I just don't want to do this.

41:21.230 --> 41:22.592
But I went home and I thought about it.

41:23.032 --> 41:25.535
He had given me his phone number, so I called him and I met him.

41:25.555 --> 41:26.456
And I really liked him.

41:27.057 --> 41:31.903
He was about the age, he and his wife were both about the age of my older kids.

41:31.923 --> 41:36.268
And they had the same aggressive intellect, so sure of themselves.

41:36.772 --> 41:47.208
And a big moment for me, we all had lunch together, when I said to Lynn, to them both, I said, why should I leave Peter, what's his name?

41:48.009 --> 41:51.535
Sterling Lord Literistic was the doctor.

41:51.555 --> 41:54.359
And she looked at me as if I was stupid.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.060
Because we're good.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.101
We're smart.

41:56.162 --> 41:56.562
We're good.

41:56.622 --> 41:59.346
And I thought my daughter would say that.

41:59.366 --> 42:00.648
This is what my daughter would say.

42:00.668 --> 42:02.531
And that was when they got me.

42:02.551 --> 42:03.673
So I, so...

42:04.548 --> 42:11.659
I sat down and wrote the book, and I think the book was very different from what Glenn had anticipated, but it was a brilliant book.

42:11.679 --> 42:13.882
And, you know, from there on in there it was.

42:13.902 --> 42:16.165
It really touched a nerve, didn't it?

42:16.185 --> 42:17.968
Just the right time.

42:17.988 --> 42:23.256
And had you thought about doing something like that, or they totally proposed it, but then you kind of get into it.

42:23.356 --> 42:28.744
And then tell me about, because I don't think we touched on this, because, all right, so they gave you this idea.

42:29.165 --> 42:30.367
Yeah, and title.

42:30.707 --> 42:32.530
And title, but then when you get into it,

42:33.185 --> 42:34.867
It took on a life of its own, didn't it?

42:34.887 --> 42:38.992
Oh, yeah, because what happened was that night after we spoke on the phone, I drove home.

42:39.833 --> 42:46.661
Sarah and I talked about it, and I realized, oh, this guy is giving me the opportunity of a lifetime.

42:46.681 --> 42:53.529
Because here I can summarize things I've been thinking about for 30 years, put it all together.

42:53.549 --> 42:59.496
I can essentially create the capstone of my career.

43:00.353 --> 43:03.617
But there was a particular way that I wanted to do it.

43:03.978 --> 43:09.245
I wanted to do it without a plan, without an outline.

43:09.265 --> 43:15.313
I just wanted to sit down with a pencil, and whatever came was going to come.

43:15.333 --> 43:17.115
And we wrote.

43:18.177 --> 43:20.900
I wrote a proposal, and Glenn read it.

43:21.081 --> 43:24.045
He said, well, it's fine, but you need a patient.

43:25.026 --> 43:29.652
So I thought about the first patient I had who died, you know, this guy who had his heart attack.

43:29.834 --> 43:32.997
I walked in the room and he died, so I wrote that story.

43:34.058 --> 43:46.091
And Glenn sent it out to 20 houses, and he called me at the end of the week, and he said, seven people want to buy this book.

43:46.111 --> 43:49.515
Buy this book!

43:49.535 --> 43:53.479
And he said, what's amazing is this was the week of Yom Kippur, and they're all away.

43:53.780 --> 43:55.362
But yet, everybody wants it.

43:55.382 --> 43:56.463
I said, what do we do now?

43:56.483 --> 43:57.604
I said, well, we interview them.

43:57.645 --> 43:58.626
We meet with them.

43:58.746 --> 44:00.087
And we hadn't heard from Knopf.

44:00.107 --> 44:07.296
So we went around, you know, Simon & Schuster, and Scribner's, and Random House, and I don't know who else, who knows.

44:07.316 --> 44:10.139
And Knopf has already published your first book, this book here.

44:10.540 --> 44:11.921
They had made no offer on it.

44:11.961 --> 44:13.683
They weren't interested at all.

44:14.464 --> 44:16.146
They didn't say anything.

44:16.667 --> 44:18.669
So Glenn said, OK, we'll have an auction.

44:20.351 --> 44:22.774
And then Knopf said, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

44:23.176 --> 44:32.466
And they made me an offer, which was more than two and a half times what Glenn was making as the floor.

44:32.786 --> 44:34.128
They love stories like that.

44:34.608 --> 44:35.950
Yeah.

44:35.970 --> 44:37.411
And, you know, the rest, bingo.

44:38.352 --> 44:39.233
So I just sat down.

44:39.253 --> 44:47.142
It took me exactly a year, January 2nd, 1992 to January 2nd, 1993.

44:47.830 --> 44:52.196
And then how about the response?

44:52.376 --> 44:55.480
Did you ever expect anything like that?

44:55.500 --> 44:58.905
You know, runaway bestseller, National Book Award winner.

44:59.345 --> 44:59.466
Crazy.

44:59.646 --> 45:00.427
So what, what?

45:00.807 --> 45:03.191
Runner up for the Pulitzer, it was the second.

45:03.551 --> 45:13.264
And the only reason it didn't win the Pulitzer, some book about birds' beaks that hadn't even been reviewed won the Pulitzer.

45:13.683 --> 45:15.886
And I got a letter from Rupp.

45:15.906 --> 45:17.388
Can I tick you off just a little bit?

45:17.408 --> 45:18.890
Well, you know what happened?

45:20.231 --> 45:24.977
I got a call, a spontaneous call from a member of the committee.

45:25.017 --> 45:36.151
He said to me, the way this committee works, we choose three titles, and we're not supposed to tell them who we think of the three should win.

45:36.191 --> 45:39.175
We give it to the Columbia Committee.

45:39.195 --> 45:41.378
There was no question that we thought should have won.

45:41.712 --> 45:43.735
What they did with it, we can't figure out.

45:43.755 --> 45:46.778
They chose this book about Bird Speaks.

45:47.379 --> 45:48.701
It's a beautifully written book.

45:48.761 --> 45:49.662
It's a really good book.

45:49.682 --> 45:50.683
A little thing, though.

45:50.703 --> 45:51.785
Yeah, and that was that.

45:51.885 --> 45:56.330
It kills me when these little expanded essays become... Wow.

45:56.731 --> 45:59.915
And the book, it was second for the Book Critics Circle Award, too.

45:59.935 --> 46:00.856
Fabulous book.

46:00.876 --> 46:03.680
I wrote it for it, as I recall.

46:03.780 --> 46:07.264
Translated into 20 languages.

46:08.003 --> 46:11.508
Do you have a sense of why it resonated so powerfully with so many readers?

46:13.191 --> 46:30.838
No one had, Glenn told me, and I went to the library, medical library, and regular library was writing, that no one had ever written a book for ordinary people, so they would know what happens in cancer, all moments, whatever.

46:31.021 --> 46:40.333
Even in medical textbooks at that time, there was no description of how death occurs and why it occurs.

46:40.353 --> 46:46.681
So essentially, it was like a textbook for ordinary readers.

46:46.701 --> 46:55.832
And because no one had written it, it just sort of burst on the scene.

46:55.852 --> 46:59.897
And of course, you've got those great reviews right from the beginning.

47:00.569 --> 47:06.697
Well, it is a textbook for ordinary readers, but it's read in just about every medical school.

47:07.097 --> 47:15.968
I mean, it's every syllabus that I've searched now, you know, which has to be very satisfying for you, too, I would think.

47:16.068 --> 47:17.870
It's my life's experience.

47:17.890 --> 47:19.092
It's your life's experience.

47:19.112 --> 47:26.661
Now, if we can just circle back, does your reading in the literature, all that has gone before, that figure in your

47:28.379 --> 47:32.723
I mean, I guess everything that we, not directly, but certainly what you've learned and what you've written.

47:32.743 --> 47:40.751
You've written this fabulous book on the monuments of medicine, certainly the literary monuments of medicine.

47:40.771 --> 47:45.995
Did any of this, you think, help you in the writing of that book?

47:46.236 --> 47:47.297
Well, you know, you're a writer.

47:47.337 --> 47:51.641
You know whatever you plan, everything goes in.

47:51.661 --> 47:53.703
Everything comes out of your unconscious mind.

47:53.863 --> 47:55.664
It's all there, and it comes out.

47:56.085 --> 47:57.306
And if you deliberately

47:57.522 --> 48:04.931
If you don't plan, as I do, just sit and you write, it's all life's experience.

48:04.951 --> 48:06.914
It's just coming in.

48:06.934 --> 48:18.568
And if you're influenced by the cadences and the rhythms of the King James Version of the Bible, it comes out in a particular way.

48:19.190 --> 48:25.180
I know it sounds awfully egotistical, but I love to read my own writing, and I read it out loud.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.485
I read everything I write aloud to my wife.

48:28.505 --> 48:29.848
I'm my fierce critic.

48:29.868 --> 48:30.969
There it is.

48:31.050 --> 48:39.323
I hate to say it, I hate to use the word fierce with my wife, but most demanding my life.

48:39.523 --> 48:43.510
But there has to be, it's so interesting to me that you

48:43.844 --> 48:45.586
hearken to the King James Bible.

48:45.667 --> 48:47.489
I hearken to my Shakespeare.

48:47.509 --> 48:48.631
I took it a year.

48:48.831 --> 48:55.040
I was an English major, and I say when I took that two-semester Shakespeare course, my life changed in a way.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.942
And it's the same language.

48:56.962 --> 48:58.725
I mean, the iambic pentameter.

48:58.765 --> 49:08.839
To learn how to read iambic pentameter, there are rhythms there, and there are nuances, which I totally believe affect the way I

49:09.325 --> 49:21.477
Like I say, the way I do write, but I write to have sentences that I read aloud that stand up when they read aloud.

49:21.497 --> 49:29.766
You know, I'm sure you get a lot of questions from people about the technique of writing, and you do it.

49:29.786 --> 49:30.807
Every writer must.

49:31.267 --> 49:35.772
And I only, you know, I wouldn't have had a teacher course.

49:36.443 --> 49:39.307
but the one thing I do know is what I tell everybody.

49:39.848 --> 49:40.629
Read it out loud.

49:40.849 --> 49:41.931
Yeah.

49:41.951 --> 49:45.215
You've got to do that.

49:45.235 --> 49:48.239
I was at NYU at the medical school about a year ago.

49:49.541 --> 49:50.042
Give me a talk.

49:50.102 --> 50:04.662
I forget what it was, but they asked me to meet with this group of residents who were taking a course in writing about medicine, and their instructor was there, and she asked me to

50:05.030 --> 50:11.357
analyzed in a literary way the first chapter of How He Died, the story of this man.

50:12.157 --> 50:13.279
And I said, I can't.

50:14.019 --> 50:14.840
So she did it.

50:15.801 --> 50:18.844
And I said, dear, I couldn't believe it.

50:19.665 --> 50:24.771
She analyzed all sorts of things about what I had done.

50:24.811 --> 50:27.613
All I did was tell the damn story.

50:29.515 --> 50:31.037
The way it happened,

50:32.047 --> 50:36.154
But apparently it's the way you're supposed to write a story.

50:36.174 --> 50:42.685
So what I'm saying is, you know from your own experience, it's in you or it's not in you.

50:42.705 --> 50:57.531
I was just telling my wife this morning, I'm just finishing up a chapter that's centered around Elaine Bagels from Princeton, and reading these texts in their original Gnostic Gospels and 3rd century texts in their original language.

50:57.933 --> 50:59.174
And it's pretty straightforward.

50:59.234 --> 51:03.860
It was a wonderful interview, and I just mean to be profiling her.

51:03.880 --> 51:08.305
And I said, well, before I get into this, I have to talk a little bit about the Old Testament.

51:08.325 --> 51:09.726
I have to talk a little bit about the New Testament.

51:09.746 --> 51:10.947
I have to talk about the Koran.

51:11.408 --> 51:14.051
The word Koran actually means read and recite.

51:14.071 --> 51:17.855
The first words said to Muhammad were read, and he was illiterate.

51:17.875 --> 51:18.155
Read.

51:18.256 --> 51:21.039
It was said to him three times, and then it was recite.

51:21.379 --> 51:24.042
And that's what Koran means, read and recite.

51:24.359 --> 51:26.662
I said, this thing has taken on a life of its own.

51:26.682 --> 51:33.689
I mean, it's going in directions, this chapter, which is now up to 4,000 words, and I still haven't gotten into pagels yet, you know.

51:33.709 --> 51:35.731
But it's all stuff I wanted to get in.

51:35.751 --> 51:37.093
I wanted to get in the Book of Mormon.

51:37.633 --> 51:40.517
I wanted to get in Mary Baker, Eddie.

51:40.537 --> 51:43.340
These are all, every religion is based on a book.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.602
I mean, the reading of a text.

51:45.622 --> 51:46.964
Is it divinely inspired?

51:47.885 --> 51:52.830
You know, Joseph Smith finds us purportedly buried in a hole, these gold plates.

51:53.047 --> 51:54.730
And you look at the influence that it has.

51:55.291 --> 51:58.055
Oh, anyway, I think I'm kind of agreeing with you.

51:58.075 --> 52:03.323
You don't really know where the thing is going, but you feel, let's develop this angle here.

52:03.423 --> 52:04.685
This feels great, you know?

52:04.706 --> 52:07.410
That's the charm of a gentle madness.

52:07.430 --> 52:08.011
It rambles.

52:08.371 --> 52:09.032
It rambles.

52:09.113 --> 52:10.174
That's the great thing about it.

52:10.395 --> 52:16.544
The other great thing about it, of course, as you tell these stories, how people acquire the passion.

52:16.564 --> 52:18.167
Oh, yeah.

52:18.187 --> 52:18.868
It is fun.

52:18.967 --> 52:21.550
Because they're all narrative.

52:21.610 --> 52:23.192
Everything is storytelling.

52:23.292 --> 52:24.033
Yeah.

52:25.175 --> 52:32.924
I've taken up a lot of your time, and I think I've got plenty here, and if I have to contact you, I know you're going out here for a right book or something.

52:33.024 --> 52:36.569
Let me, I want to give you that essay.

52:36.649 --> 52:37.670
Come with me upstairs.

52:38.891 --> 52:39.813
Let me shut this off.

52:41.655 --> 52:43.777
The first half of the book, you're saying something about it?

52:43.958 --> 52:48.383
Yeah, the first half of the book, of this volume, is the

52:48.616 --> 52:50.879
the original.

52:50.899 --> 52:55.464
And so it's all facsimile from the Yale copy.

52:55.484 --> 52:57.647
There are only sixteen copies in the world left.

52:58.047 --> 52:59.890
And the second half is the translation.

53:00.851 --> 53:07.058
And one of these chapters, chapter fourteen, which is only, I think, two paragraphs long.

53:07.779 --> 53:15.088
Well, one short paragraph and one long one is the essence of all of it, which is in this one paragraph.

53:15.288 --> 53:15.849
That's the chapter?

53:16.890 --> 53:17.391
Fourteen.

53:18.350 --> 53:22.235
Do you want it in the Latin?

53:22.275 --> 53:23.636
That's the translation I just showed?

53:23.656 --> 53:24.858
This is the translation.

53:25.238 --> 53:28.262
Yeah, that's fine.

53:29.423 --> 53:35.971
Oh, I want to show you that desalius.

53:37.233 --> 53:39.896
You wrote prefaces for how many of these?

53:40.016 --> 53:42.760
I wrote prefaces for about fifteen.

53:42.900 --> 53:43.901
That's a lot, though.

53:44.502 --> 53:46.264
Actually, the first book I ever wrote

53:46.852 --> 53:50.238
was this thing, which I wrote for the Classics of Medicine Library.

53:50.258 --> 53:52.501
It's a book about the history of anesthesia.

53:52.521 --> 53:57.930
And what it is, it's my comments and the original papers.

53:58.050 --> 53:59.392
It's no real book.

54:02.237 --> 54:02.537
Excellent.

54:02.558 --> 54:05.082
And you were going to get me a copy of an essay, I think.

54:05.102 --> 54:05.783
Yes, I will.

54:06.364 --> 54:11.492
But first, I want to keep your wife and daughter that I do want to share with you.

54:18.273 --> 54:37.797
Again, this is a facsimile of the book made from the original plates just before the war.

54:38.999 --> 54:43.825
It's astonishing to me that those plates survived and then lost.

54:43.845 --> 54:45.647
Yeah, horrible.

54:47.315 --> 54:49.057
That's fabulous.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.339
Thankfully, they didn't color anything.

54:52.320 --> 54:59.007
I'm not a collector, but I have a couple of things.

54:59.768 --> 55:12.220
Ambrose Perret, who I wrote about in the book, in 1634, it was translated into English for the first time.

55:13.441 --> 55:15.443
And I'm sure you've had this experience.

55:15.463 --> 55:17.085
I came in the office one day.

55:17.470 --> 55:27.120
It was a brown paper bag, and I opened it up, and this was in the bag from the widow of one of them.

55:27.140 --> 55:28.221
Oh, excellent.

55:28.321 --> 55:29.843
It's the Paré.

55:30.023 --> 55:32.826
The first Paré translation, 1634.

55:33.487 --> 55:38.212
You do have a great book.

55:38.232 --> 55:38.832
Yeah.

55:38.852 --> 55:46.060
And this is an old prescription that was in here.

55:46.360 --> 55:54.932
Somewhere in this book is the name, a little piece of paper with the name of every person who's ever owned this book.

55:54.952 --> 55:56.334
Are there any notable ones?

55:56.494 --> 55:58.017
No, no, they're just doctors.

55:58.818 --> 55:59.779
American doctors.

55:59.799 --> 56:00.640
Are there annotations?

56:00.841 --> 56:10.875
Some of them are, you know, they were English originally and they become, well, someone has written a piece of something from Chaucer, a quotation from Chaucer in here.

56:11.115 --> 56:14.460
Is there an applicability to this, do you think?

56:14.930 --> 56:17.353
I read it such a long time ago, I can't tell you.

56:17.373 --> 56:18.475
Oh, it's about the doctor.

56:18.615 --> 56:22.821
It's just his description, you know, the doctor physically took.

56:22.841 --> 56:24.243
He makes fun of that doctor.

56:26.786 --> 56:32.374
It's interesting that one of the owners chose to... I have a goat.

56:32.394 --> 56:32.875
Do you really?

56:32.935 --> 56:39.384
I take alloperno, but if I don't take it, it's horrible.

56:41.346 --> 56:43.109
It's an awful thing, isn't it?

56:43.129 --> 56:43.249
It is.

56:45.389 --> 56:48.693
So this has just been passed down from one person to the other.

56:48.733 --> 56:49.794
That's the beauty of a book.

56:50.014 --> 56:54.980
And I got the Morgane the same way, in a paper bag, all three volumes.

56:55.580 --> 57:07.313
I had them on a three bag.

57:07.333 --> 57:12.679
But this is the first English translation of the Morgane, and this is just in great shape.

57:21.232 --> 57:23.318
I love all these little places.

57:23.338 --> 57:24.661
I love these shelves with it.

57:24.722 --> 57:25.564
My wife's adventure.

57:25.584 --> 57:27.289
Yeah, when the tables come.

57:27.349 --> 57:28.532
I've never seen that before.

57:28.632 --> 57:29.374
That's wonderful.

57:29.394 --> 57:33.445
Yeah, when we put these bookshelves in, she said, why don't we do that?

57:33.646 --> 57:34.849
I've never seen that.

57:34.869 --> 57:36.253
That's pretty fabulous.

57:52.670 --> 58:17.935
If you don't mind, it's a...
