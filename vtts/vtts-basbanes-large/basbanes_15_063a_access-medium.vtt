00:02.107 --> 00:05.830
Can I interrupt with some very happy news?

00:05.991 --> 00:06.351
Sure.

00:06.531 --> 00:12.717
You know, your book went on sale on the 6th of November.

00:12.737 --> 00:19.163
And Barnes & Noble counts their sales in weekly cycles, which ended on the 7th.

00:19.964 --> 00:25.769
In two days, your book is the best-selling book in Barnes & Noble countrywide.

00:25.889 --> 00:28.992
Two days compared to a week for everything else.

00:29.613 --> 00:36.762
Well, I was down at the Strand this morning, and Fred Bass is selling your book, and he said he sold 128 copies on Friday.

00:38.384 --> 00:38.705
Friday.

00:38.845 --> 00:39.506
And he's selling it.

00:39.626 --> 00:42.429
The board in Atlanta said they sold hundreds.

00:42.449 --> 00:48.497
There were not that many people who were waiting out in the chill at midnight, but they have sold hundreds.

00:48.517 --> 00:51.321
They don't even know how many.

00:51.341 --> 00:52.222
But anyway, congratulations.

00:52.242 --> 00:52.903
I'll let you go to it.

00:52.923 --> 00:54.865
Thanks.

00:54.885 --> 00:57.308
That must make you feel pretty good.

00:57.328 --> 00:58.590
Well, it does.

00:58.610 --> 00:58.810
Maybe, uh,

00:59.802 --> 01:04.306
But still my overwhelming feeling is relief.

01:04.326 --> 01:05.467
That thing took so long.

01:05.487 --> 01:06.568
It was really criminal.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.431
It shouldn't happen that way.

01:09.571 --> 01:10.192
I disagree.

01:10.252 --> 01:16.138
I think it appears to me to be a work that had to be leisurely.

01:17.459 --> 01:21.383
I'm just so admiring of lovely accomplishments.

01:21.403 --> 01:22.083
Well, thank you.

01:22.163 --> 01:29.050
Most of the real writing took place in the last year.

01:29.705 --> 01:31.587
before publication.

01:31.727 --> 01:37.513
I sense that because there are resonances of things that are going on right now, you know.

01:37.673 --> 01:50.966
No, I... It had been the first time the internet had put its mangy pause into the news with Matt Drudge.

01:51.247 --> 01:52.428
Great.

01:52.448 --> 01:55.411
I think I said, ha, this gives me an idea.

01:55.551 --> 01:59.695
I've always said that all books are written in six months.

02:00.282 --> 02:02.265
and that the rest is dancing around the project.

02:02.686 --> 02:03.147
I love that.

02:03.167 --> 02:07.934
And I lied, this took a year, but it was 740 pages.

02:10.518 --> 02:11.420
It shouldn't be that way.

02:12.101 --> 02:17.550
What, did you have a sense of the story over it, throughout the point of the course of the research, though?

02:17.570 --> 02:26.003
Well, I had the basic story, but I made a colossal blunder, or I was a costly lady.

02:26.540 --> 02:32.188
I knew I'd wanted to include plantations in South Georgia because I'd seen them for the first time and I'd never seen anything like it.

02:32.208 --> 02:36.814
They're such unbelievable forms of conspicuous consumption.

02:36.834 --> 02:39.277
There's nothing else like them.

02:39.297 --> 02:43.783
I used to think the private jet was about as big as conspicuous consumption gets.

02:44.524 --> 02:53.616
But they have these 15, 20, 25, 30,000 acre plantations just for shooting quail 13 weeks out of the year.

02:53.636 --> 02:55.419
$4,500 per quail.

02:55.439 --> 02:56.260
Right, exactly.

02:57.016 --> 03:04.025
And they have to claim to fly them back and forth from Atlanta or wherever.

03:04.165 --> 03:19.366
Anyway, I made the mistake of saying, okay, I'm going to have a man who owns a plantation, but he's going to live in New York, you know, the Atlanta developer who made a pig and he wants to be in New York and get very, really big time.

03:19.386 --> 03:22.089
And I struggled with this concept in years.

03:23.131 --> 03:23.271
Really?

03:23.291 --> 03:26.415
And until I realized that if,

03:28.893 --> 03:31.016
The plantations were so intriguing.

03:32.037 --> 03:35.142
The book really had to be in Atlanta, so that's where people come from.

03:35.162 --> 03:36.944
Some from Birmingham, but mostly Atlanta.

03:36.964 --> 03:38.627
It only came to you in the last year or so?

03:38.727 --> 03:41.251
It came to me in... Really?

03:41.571 --> 03:45.276
Well, it actually came to me in November of 95.

03:45.296 --> 03:46.778
And I'm astonished.

03:46.798 --> 03:54.049
I was having lunch with Jonathan Galassi, who's my editor at Starstruck.

03:54.089 --> 03:58.495
And I turned in about 800 pages of manuscript.

03:59.437 --> 04:00.238
All about New York.

04:01.680 --> 04:08.269
Except for the plantation students, you know, a few scenes in California, because I already had this character, Conrad, in mind.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.571
You had Conrad in mind.

04:09.591 --> 04:11.814
I didn't mind from the beginning.

04:11.954 --> 04:14.178
I didn't know I was going to deal with him, but I didn't mind.

04:14.198 --> 04:21.227
That probably explains why I don't know what, I had no idea what he was there for until he performed the function.

04:21.247 --> 04:26.355
Well, if I could have gotten him together with Charlie Sooner, I would have, but it just wasn't possible.

04:26.755 --> 04:28.077
You did better?

04:29.153 --> 04:42.072
So I was having lunch with Jonathan, and I started telling him some stories of things that I'd run across, and of course I was working on this thing.

04:42.092 --> 04:43.014
And they were all about Atlanta.

04:44.035 --> 04:54.611
And I, because I'd been there a number of times for the plantation business, and I said to him, you know, sometimes I wish I had set this book in Atlanta instead of New York.

04:55.312 --> 04:57.996
And he was, I was missing the beat, says, well, why don't you?

04:58.212 --> 05:12.770
This is November of 19th, so with that kind of seal of approval, I started in January of 1906, researching Atlantian artists.

05:12.790 --> 05:26.768
And I started rewriting it, I think, in a Atlanta book, in the late spring of really the summer of 1911.

05:27.625 --> 05:34.895
And the whole thing was selling the place to eat.

05:34.915 --> 05:38.920
I'd always wanted to use Freaknik somehow, which nobody's ever written about.

05:38.940 --> 05:40.462
That's a real thing, right?

05:40.482 --> 05:41.263
Yeah, absolutely.

05:41.283 --> 05:42.484
I never heard of it.

05:42.504 --> 05:48.512
And my description, in fact, is kind of mild compared to what really goes on in Freaknik.

05:48.532 --> 05:53.599
The Vyde magazine had a culture spread of Freaknik.

05:54.068 --> 05:57.893
of the 1997 frequency, an issue not that long ago.

05:59.876 --> 06:10.590
And the real thing was much wilder than I would have dared be in mine, since the crisis was quite real.

06:11.551 --> 06:16.397
And once I had quick makes sense, I said, I've got to have the black-white politics of the mind.

06:17.198 --> 06:22.405
And then I somehow, I don't know how I thought of Roger, too white to, as a lawyer, but I thought of him.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.123
And I was really feeling great.

06:24.363 --> 06:26.206
Finally, got all the pieces in place.

06:26.326 --> 06:26.887
I had a plot.

06:27.808 --> 06:30.813
I knew it would work.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.315
And I had a heart attack.

06:32.335 --> 06:34.098
You had a heart attack?

06:34.118 --> 06:34.258
Yeah.

06:34.659 --> 06:38.345
This was in August of my next day.

06:38.365 --> 06:42.872
And I had a huge bypass operation.

06:42.892 --> 06:50.704
And it was November, early November, before I was ready to do things.

06:51.494 --> 06:55.560
And I went into a period of absolute glory.

06:55.680 --> 07:03.251
Usually bypass the patient's death depression.

07:04.693 --> 07:05.153
It's very common.

07:05.173 --> 07:06.155
I was before it.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.098
I wrote so much I couldn't believe it.

07:08.118 --> 07:14.987
I stayed until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my wife begging me to save my strength instead.

07:15.027 --> 07:17.231
You can't punish yourself this way.

07:17.251 --> 07:18.132
Ah, never mind.

07:18.152 --> 07:21.096
And I wrote this novella.

07:24.012 --> 07:25.533
called Ambush at Fort Bragg.

07:26.514 --> 07:32.420
It was the stuff that was New York City, which I was nailed as taken out of the book.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.564
And I had, you know, maybe 35 pages of this thing.

07:36.584 --> 07:40.507
So it kind of had 180 pages of it.

07:40.527 --> 07:44.511
And it became a novella in France and Spain.

07:44.912 --> 07:51.758
I presume it will be published here eventually, but the paragraph didn't want to bring out a short book before.

07:51.873 --> 07:53.776
Is it related at all to this?

07:53.996 --> 07:54.217
No.

07:54.377 --> 08:10.062
It was, the book was going to start with an old co-log in which you're in the, it's two o'clock in the morning, you're in the control, the control room of a, of a network television.

08:10.122 --> 08:14.069
That's other network.

08:14.089 --> 08:18.015
And it's about to produce a star of another kind of thing.

08:20.797 --> 08:34.390
And I also wrote a, in the same period before you, I wrote an 8,000 word piece about neuroscience.

08:34.410 --> 08:36.472
I'm a neuroscience prophet.

08:36.492 --> 08:41.017
I love to follow all the, I think, fabulous piece in the time this morning.

08:41.037 --> 08:41.637
After you've seen the thing.

08:41.657 --> 08:43.019
I wrote down this morning from NASA.

08:43.439 --> 08:44.000
Right.

08:44.080 --> 08:50.466
And there's a piece about an experiment done at Emory University of Atlanta with

08:51.593 --> 08:54.936
about testosterone levels.

08:54.956 --> 08:57.719
Oh, that's all that was interesting to me.

08:57.739 --> 09:00.622
I looked at monkeys before the AFAC.

09:00.822 --> 09:05.887
I had never been so happy in my life.

09:06.028 --> 09:07.329
It was very strange.

09:07.349 --> 09:09.992
And I was aggressive, and I'm not aggressive.

09:10.152 --> 09:18.160
I was shaking my fist at people in traffic, and they all give way, because they could do nothing worse than a nut in New York.

09:19.401 --> 09:21.263
And I chewed out a doctor,

09:21.732 --> 09:24.195
not realizing I had an appointment with him.

09:25.417 --> 09:30.865
And I would never raise my voice to a doctor.

09:30.885 --> 09:32.467
And it turned out he was right.

09:32.487 --> 09:35.011
I was, you know, I was a week early.

09:35.572 --> 09:38.616
And he kept saying, will you come right on there?

09:38.636 --> 09:43.463
I'm going to, uh, sometimes it's really nice to have a pre-examination.

09:43.483 --> 09:47.869
He was just going to get his nut out of it right now.

09:47.889 --> 09:48.830
But also I was still happy.

09:49.872 --> 09:51.334
Then came the crash.

09:52.158 --> 09:57.484
That was in mid-January of 97.

09:59.747 --> 10:03.211
And I'd never had depression, but I had one before.

10:03.231 --> 10:05.614
I didn't know what it was at first.

10:05.634 --> 10:08.117
It was certainly, everything's going to go wrong.

10:08.137 --> 10:11.742
There's no way you can finish up with anything else if you want to do.

10:11.762 --> 10:13.544
Your mind is in the constant turmoil.

10:13.564 --> 10:15.927
What is Charlie's depression there, as you can say?

10:16.007 --> 10:17.709
I grew up on him.

10:17.729 --> 10:19.170
I grew up on him.

10:19.331 --> 10:20.873
I grew up on him.

10:20.893 --> 10:21.333
I don't experience it.

10:21.353 --> 10:21.714
I'm feeling sorry.

10:21.734 --> 10:22.114
Horrible.

10:23.056 --> 10:33.652
And I finally called a old friend of mine who had to do a heavy psychiatry at John Hopkins.

10:33.672 --> 10:40.383
And he kind of, he was on the phone with me the other day for a day.

10:41.424 --> 10:49.156
And one of those weeks, literally, and he kind of scared me out of it.

10:49.176 --> 10:49.977
And then I started writing again.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.780
And it was late in June, 1997.

10:52.874 --> 10:55.458
from there up to the middle of college this year.

10:56.460 --> 10:59.845
I don't think I've ever turned out as much stuff in my life.

11:00.727 --> 11:07.337
I don't want to have to ever do it that way again, because... Do you rewrite much, or is it pretty... No, I rewrite a lot.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.786
Can I tell you, there's a formula that you have one typo in here that you ought to fix.

11:13.127 --> 11:15.170
What's that?

11:15.190 --> 11:18.075
Identify the LexisNexis database.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.978
That's N-E-X-I-S, N-E-X-I-S.

11:21.106 --> 11:49.206
you spell it like the car every year yeah i don't know i'll find out what pages of it it's where lodger is checking out charlie i know you're a stickler for it yeah no i know there'll be multiple editions so you're right here you know i i i have a lexus nexus account i'm sorry no no i think if there are any typos or misspellings it's my fault i really pushed them i'll eventually check that but they are very good about checking out usually it's usually not a house where you find

11:49.878 --> 11:54.665
I'm probably the only one in the world that you thought of that.

11:54.685 --> 12:02.195
When you talk about re-writing, I kept re-writing chapters after that, or when you put into the handbook.

12:04.038 --> 12:07.823
And they found that, yeah, I don't see that many repetitions and stuff.

12:07.843 --> 12:09.005
It really is about peace.

12:09.385 --> 12:19.159
Well, I put it in the book of 820-odd pages, and I started to do like a cut.

12:19.527 --> 12:20.288
And I really could.

12:20.308 --> 12:23.894
There were so many cases where I... Do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures?

12:23.914 --> 12:24.315
No, no.

12:24.355 --> 12:27.721
I'd repeat things.

12:27.741 --> 12:30.606
But I think it's tight, really tight.

12:32.789 --> 12:37.397
Really, I mean, even in terms of using the same words over it, it's superannuated.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.619
I think you only use twice.

12:40.422 --> 12:42.025
I love that word.

12:42.646 --> 12:46.791
Oh, I discovered that at the age of 16.

12:47.131 --> 12:48.133
Super-graduated?

12:48.153 --> 12:48.393
You love it.

12:48.413 --> 12:49.214
Yeah.

12:49.274 --> 12:51.156
I'm Charles Lamb wrote an essay.

12:51.176 --> 12:52.378
Oh, I'm a super-graduated man.

12:52.398 --> 12:53.519
Oh, yeah, it's wonderful.

12:53.539 --> 12:54.861
Oh, I'm a great Lamb fan.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.986
I'll send a copy of it if I can find it.

12:59.006 --> 13:01.969
I know it from college decades.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.010
It's a wonderful word.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.072
I love it.

13:04.232 --> 13:09.879
I've been citing his dissertation on what he did.

13:09.899 --> 13:10.099
Wow.

13:10.439 --> 13:11.100
That's my...

13:12.127 --> 13:27.440
metaphor or conceit for the typical novelist today who evows the first 25 years of his life as material and has probably a wonderful first novel.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.482
Then the second novel has only two more years.

13:30.403 --> 13:32.845
It's a cannibalized.

13:33.225 --> 13:38.470
And he's like the farmer who burns his house down over and over to get some more of those pigs.

13:39.891 --> 13:42.133
But after a while the rest of the stairs will diminish return.

13:42.805 --> 14:03.132
It really shocks me that you just came up with the Atlanta focus in the last couple of years, because I think my opening question would have been, do you see this book as a companion volume to Bonfire, in a way, which was in New York City and now they're going into the Southern Metropolis?

14:03.152 --> 14:03.572
And do you?

14:03.732 --> 14:05.875
I mean, let me offer that as a question.

14:05.895 --> 14:11.783
Do you see it as a companion volume, as a continuation of some of the themes that you explored?

14:12.117 --> 14:25.392
Now, I never, honestly, never thought of it that way, and I knew fairly early on that I wanted to introduce a religious element, but it had to be a modern religious element.

14:28.396 --> 14:41.010
Nietzsche, who, no matter what you think of his overall philosophy, turned out to be a great prophet, because he prophesied the spread of atheism.

14:42.357 --> 14:49.525
And he prophesied the world wars of the 20th century, so the 20th century would be a century wars.

14:52.288 --> 14:55.091
Catastrophic beyond all imagination.

14:55.652 --> 15:12.330
And he, for this period, he predicted a period of, what do you call it, a transvaluation or revaluation, in which people were desperately searching for new sets of values to be placed

15:12.732 --> 15:16.876
the old Christian values that were dominant in the world for so long.

15:18.158 --> 15:28.669
And he said, there wouldn't be a lot of people utilizing, resurrecting old religions, and he said, none of it will work.

15:28.709 --> 15:41.423
Because unless you honestly believe that there is some superior being that's more powerful and important than you are, it's not going to happen.

15:42.145 --> 15:49.335
and also that the superior being makes us human beings a completely different order from the beast of the field.

15:50.878 --> 15:54.503
Anyway, he said, this would be that period.

15:55.324 --> 16:11.848
And so I was intrigued, I was wondering if you think the sternest religious doctrine ever developed sources, which has a certain influence on Christianity's part, and places in modern-day America

16:12.048 --> 16:22.061
If you do a recent take in that book, it's the year 2000, if you look at kind of that age and how long you've done this and that.

16:22.121 --> 16:27.689
I had to put it ahead so you'd get rid of the tenant from the area of Atlanta and put in a meeting.

16:27.969 --> 16:30.372
Nobody would need to care about that.

16:30.392 --> 16:32.455
Well, I think it helps.

16:33.236 --> 16:39.725
It eliminates some possible problems, too, or anything.

16:39.745 --> 16:39.945
Right now.

16:41.917 --> 16:47.443
I would love to be able to be a steward, but I know very well that I'm not ready.

16:49.745 --> 17:02.819
But I thought that a man like Charlie Crooker might be receptive to it if he's in a sufficiently weakened state and I have nothing else to hang on to.

17:03.579 --> 17:09.966
And he doesn't even have his wife to hang on to because she's just not for better or for worse than the man.

17:11.296 --> 17:15.543
And you really can't count on his friends because they're just career friends.

17:15.563 --> 17:20.993
They're his friends because he's a big timer and they're a big time.

17:21.013 --> 17:27.364
Would this sufficiently prepare a man for Epictetus and a religion of the first century A.D.?

17:27.244 --> 17:27.364
?

17:28.103 --> 17:33.192
Now, there are those I've read in the years who do not buy this ending.

17:33.212 --> 17:36.938
You know, I was reading this book when I was in the ruins of Ephesus, by the way.

17:37.038 --> 17:37.739
Oh, really?

17:37.759 --> 17:38.380
Yeah, it's a charm.

17:38.421 --> 17:45.753
This book is resonating for me, even surrounded by these ancient pagans, you know.

17:45.773 --> 17:46.614
I'm sorry, go ahead.

17:46.634 --> 17:47.436
No, no, no, no.

17:47.456 --> 17:51.723
I'm glad to go to this picture of the book.

17:51.763 --> 17:52.845
Well, go ahead.

17:53.652 --> 17:57.458
I love the ending makes sense to me.

17:57.878 --> 18:02.024
I like the ending.

18:02.545 --> 18:09.455
I mean, a couple of the reviewers have said probably not how to end this novel.

18:09.475 --> 18:11.738
I liked it perfectly, really.

18:11.759 --> 18:15.364
I mean, in the epilogue, you don't tell us about Serena, but that's obvious.

18:15.384 --> 18:15.885
She's gone.

18:16.285 --> 18:17.807
I hint that she's gone.

18:18.568 --> 18:19.570
It's obvious that she's gone.

18:19.590 --> 18:20.351
She's gone.

18:20.652 --> 18:21.753
She's for better and for better.

18:21.793 --> 18:23.035
I mean, that's...

18:23.572 --> 18:33.384
And as the mayor puts it, I don't think Mrs. Croker believes that the sweet things... I believe that Mrs. Croker believes the sweet things is why we end when we die.

18:35.947 --> 18:42.915
None of the critics have suggested that really Charlie becomes a full man at the end.

18:42.935 --> 18:43.576
I think.

18:43.596 --> 18:45.038
And maybe you have more.

18:45.118 --> 18:45.418
No, no.

18:45.818 --> 18:48.181
At whose salvation he becomes a man in full.

18:48.402 --> 18:50.524
He becomes a man in full.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.665
Of course, you introduced that phrase on page five or six.

18:55.666 --> 19:03.358
And then really, it only makes sense to me when he does, however lame-brained it is, it makes sense.

19:03.478 --> 19:07.103
I mean, he's gone through the wall of fire.

19:07.123 --> 19:12.270
He's gone through the wall of fire.

19:12.371 --> 19:14.514
Is it a satire, any of you?

19:14.674 --> 19:15.435
No.

19:15.796 --> 19:18.199
I've seen a few people call it satire.

19:19.462 --> 19:35.840
I have always hated the word satire, even for the bonfire advantage of anything else, because to me, I realize this is not the dictionary definition, but to me, satire is the truth taken to an extreme for the sake of mockery.

19:36.221 --> 19:45.191
Of course, the dictionary just says it's a satire that's a piece of writing that dwells on the foibles of mankind.

19:45.211 --> 19:48.034
Well, I would hope that all novels,

19:48.942 --> 19:57.212
But anyway, these satires are kind of a limiting thing.

19:58.053 --> 20:08.566
And certainly the religious part of this book, at least in my mind, is not at all satirical.

20:10.288 --> 20:18.898
There's a little soul-searching that goes on here among Conrad, by Conrad and by.

20:19.199 --> 20:20.760
By yourself, too.

20:22.282 --> 20:24.384
I thought a lot about these things.

20:24.404 --> 20:29.709
Clearly, you've considered your own mortality in recent months.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.811
Yes, that you can be sure of.

20:32.331 --> 20:45.844
And what's interesting about realizing your mortality, really feeling it, when you're young, you just cannot conceive of it.

20:45.864 --> 20:48.126
It's a real instruction.

20:49.625 --> 20:59.578
is to know that we all have a finite time on this earth.

20:59.598 --> 21:07.288
And we are, as Epictetus says, just a bowl of clay with a quart of blood, and that eventually we have to give it back.

21:08.389 --> 21:13.015
And I think that should set the soul at ease.

21:14.738 --> 21:17.421
You know, I'm 55.

21:17.992 --> 21:18.713
You're a kid.

21:18.733 --> 21:41.569
Well, this is internally, and you have followed a certain generation through the decades, you know, and all of a sudden, we've got these guys in my 50s and 60s, and all of a sudden, you do realize that you are definitely a lot older, and out of it, when I was walking in Thessaloniki, the last day,

21:42.258 --> 21:49.528
There are 70,000 students at this Aristotle University, and they must have all been having coffee one day down in Mississippi.

21:49.989 --> 21:55.637
All these thousands of kids, sunglasses on the kids, all the cell phones, drinking coffee.

21:55.717 --> 22:01.625
And I said, I look to these kids like I must be 100 years old.

22:03.067 --> 22:10.257
There's no way that Twain could ever meet in any kind of... And I'm wondering, are you kind of... Is this a commentary for this?

22:10.473 --> 22:17.863
this generation seems to be approaching, this, uh, yeah, the sixteenth century.

22:18.143 --> 22:30.600
I know myself, not because of any sexual escapades, but I know myself that at 55, I did feel like I was a kid.

22:30.620 --> 22:35.967
I was maybe 27 or 8.

22:35.987 --> 22:36.868
And I would, I looked

22:39.093 --> 22:39.694
very young.

22:39.794 --> 22:41.977
I always had them in my life, but very young.

22:41.997 --> 22:43.219
And I still looked very young.

22:43.379 --> 22:51.811
Even at 57, I can remember the pictures taken right after the Bonfire of Andrews came out.

22:52.592 --> 22:53.554
But it's only a threat.

22:55.236 --> 22:55.957
It's just a threat.

22:55.997 --> 22:56.658
It's not a cable.

22:57.679 --> 23:01.184
And it's going to snap.

23:02.306 --> 23:03.007
And it does.

23:03.107 --> 23:03.868
It snaps.

23:06.432 --> 23:07.193
And I had, you know,

23:08.101 --> 23:13.027
Before I had a heart attack, I was such a guy who was exercising all the time.

23:13.107 --> 23:16.851
Really, probably not aerobically enough, but I was exercising.

23:17.012 --> 23:18.313
And I had to become a body snob.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.195
I see a guy who's pulling, but they can't.

23:20.215 --> 23:22.678
And I say, yeah, you're going to fall down and die next week.

23:23.179 --> 23:25.041
And I was going to fell down next week.

23:26.162 --> 23:30.588
Because you talked about definitions of the phrases.

23:30.608 --> 23:36.194
Poor Martha has gone off to the workout studio and killing herself.

23:36.214 --> 23:36.775
That's right.

23:37.177 --> 23:40.702
to get her body to look like a boy with breasts and everything.

23:41.643 --> 23:46.489
These freighters really do get them, and they really catch her.

23:47.210 --> 23:54.739
That is one of the... I've seen in my lifetime the... I just tried to get those heads with green.

23:55.440 --> 24:00.226
The feminine ideal has changed.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.712
It used to be a phrase that was highly complimentary because she's a voluptuous woman.

24:05.293 --> 24:06.154
That meant bless you.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.350
It felt like a brick.

24:09.691 --> 24:18.541
And now, that look upon it is grossly overweight, and it's in my eye.

24:18.581 --> 24:23.466
It probably says something about where I am in the class.

24:23.486 --> 24:26.709
It's here, you're 55 now.

24:26.729 --> 24:35.719
And suddenly there is this look, and you see it everywhere, even in the pages of magazines.

24:36.543 --> 24:59.945
of this look of, sometimes these boys with breasts, slim hips, slim waist, and even a slightly big widening torso, wide shoulders, with these two hooters somehow built into the picture.

24:59.965 --> 25:06.111
If you look at some of the old pornography, it was pretty tame compared to what's around today.

25:06.817 --> 25:07.958
I have these barbells.

25:08.319 --> 25:16.127
A lot can be learned through the history of pornography, I guess.

25:16.147 --> 25:31.063
Things which you explored in Bonfire and again in Sex, of course, Race, the Cupcake Syndrome, I don't know if you call it Cupcake Syndrome, but could you comment a little bit on that?

25:31.243 --> 25:33.145
I think the second wife

25:34.019 --> 25:36.743
I guess you called it a cupcake in the first book.

25:36.803 --> 25:37.384
I did use it.

25:37.684 --> 25:39.968
I know I did use a cupcake somewhere.

25:40.068 --> 25:41.650
A French pastry or something like that.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.892
The new cookies.

25:42.912 --> 25:43.933
It was something like that.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.524
The racial thing comes up in both.

25:53.166 --> 25:53.807
But it's different.

25:53.908 --> 25:55.069
It's middle class black.

25:55.109 --> 25:56.331
The Clarence Thomas thing is

25:56.699 --> 26:05.451
right on the button because everybody in America couldn't believe all these extraordinarily articulate people who didn't speak with a trace of dialect.

26:05.772 --> 26:13.262
And that obviously played on your perception of how to develop this as well.

26:13.282 --> 26:18.670
I became intrigued once I said I wanted to read this book about Atlanta.

26:18.690 --> 26:24.117
I just have to learn something about the black white politics of Atlanta.

26:24.137 --> 26:25.980
And then you do realize that

26:28.525 --> 26:52.879
in politics in Atlanta are people who are basically black professionals, well-educated, and there really isn't much difference between them and white politicians, except the fact that they are much more attuned to, well, it's not true anymore.

26:53.062 --> 26:55.605
But that's not true.

26:55.745 --> 27:07.316
The White House is a team that also in a place like Atlanta, or a place like in New York, particularly Atlanta, that his leadership is Black.

27:09.198 --> 27:22.191
So I took a chance on going inside the mind of a Black lawyer, because I still was, as it was.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.642
This is almost as Roger's book.

27:25.662 --> 27:27.544
I mean, it's Charlie's book.

27:27.564 --> 27:32.249
But Roger really does emerge as someone develops.

27:33.451 --> 27:40.398
He definitely goes from point A to point B to point C. And he is on the brink of one in premier in Atlanta at the end.

27:41.039 --> 27:42.280
He's got the buzz now.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.502
He's definitely got the buzz.

27:44.983 --> 27:51.891
Well, I hadn't noticed this conflict within a lot of various

27:52.698 --> 28:02.208
whether you get a black professional, they have, they are in a good position to make it within a predominant white world.

28:02.329 --> 28:06.253
They have law, of medicine, whatever.

28:07.394 --> 28:15.463
At the same time, they feel guilty about not stopping along the way to help the black underclass.

28:16.244 --> 28:22.030
And it's a constant tug of war.

28:23.174 --> 28:30.964
finally gets his own salvation when he takes on, reluctantly, the Ferry's famine case.

28:31.064 --> 28:34.569
Did this come early on in the gestation period of the small thing?

28:34.589 --> 28:38.835
Not until I finally—it was the spring of 96.

28:38.855 --> 28:40.277
I mean, wait a minute.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.821
Yeah, spring of 96.

28:44.342 --> 28:52.793
But I began—see, I had to have the political question now.

28:53.633 --> 29:01.940
If you write about series today, in an honest way, you really have to write about race and have mystery.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.581
You can't avoid it, I think.

29:02.701 --> 29:07.665
When we had our interview in 1979, I guess it was when the white stuff came up.

29:07.685 --> 29:09.487
And you were kind of saying, what's up next?

29:09.547 --> 29:21.497
Well, I'm thinking we'll do a novel about, and Trollope, you were talking about, you were thinking a lot about Vanity Fair of New York, and you did that.

29:22.578 --> 29:22.678
Yeah.

29:23.468 --> 29:27.334
And that was your first leap into fiction.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.016
You know, I hadn't cared about it.

29:29.056 --> 29:35.286
I went on to, when I was in college, that Washington and Reagan was in it.

29:35.306 --> 29:42.116
I assumed that every other aspiring young writer, that the novel would be the form I would see.

29:42.757 --> 29:52.952
But then I went to work on newspapers, and it began to be exciting just to do things in nonfiction.

29:53.843 --> 30:01.953
because it's a literary form, in the words, kind of where the Gage and Reese was doing things like that.

30:02.113 --> 30:04.316
Yeah, you read all the stuff and you admired yourself.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.398
Well, I was, you're out of the pipe.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.882
Well, actually, it was when I saw what Gage and Reese could do.

30:09.903 --> 30:14.949
It was on the Times, I was on the Hill Street, and I said, I've got to get my act together.

30:14.969 --> 30:17.852
And it was all done through reporting.

30:17.952 --> 30:19.754
You couldn't do the stuff without reporting.

30:19.775 --> 30:20.656
It was done through reporting.

30:20.676 --> 30:21.356
Exactly.

30:21.376 --> 30:23.479
I mean, I, the message that I,

30:24.421 --> 30:35.113
trying to keep sending out into the literary world, and we could never listen to it, is that reporting is the heart, should be the heart of a modern novel.

30:37.116 --> 30:38.197
In a way, it always was.

30:38.217 --> 30:48.809
You have to think of Zola, Balzac, to the extent that he'd go through the recording.

30:48.829 --> 30:53.314
And that, in successful writing,

30:55.150 --> 31:07.847
The content, the material you get, is about 70 percent of the successful growth, and talent is about 30 percent.

31:07.867 --> 31:11.652
When you're young, you think that talent is 95 percent, so that's all you've got.

31:12.693 --> 31:14.456
And material is 5 percent.

31:14.476 --> 31:23.588
You recognize you have to write about something, but I think the older you get, the more you realize it's material and its structure, it's not pretty simple.

31:24.513 --> 31:26.495
My three paragraphs.

31:26.775 --> 31:27.956
It's fabulous.

31:27.976 --> 31:28.277
It's fabulous.

31:28.297 --> 31:28.877
It's fabulous.

31:28.897 --> 31:39.088
I've tried the plumsiest writer, perhaps whoever I published, the material was great and instinctively great.

31:39.108 --> 31:41.270
And you can't resist it.

31:41.290 --> 31:44.373
You kind of blackened it to death with the plumsiest prose.

31:44.393 --> 31:47.276
Did you actually witness a speck?

31:47.296 --> 31:48.878
Yeah, I did.

31:48.898 --> 31:49.498
I certainly did.

31:49.518 --> 31:53.322
And it was presented as entertainment, just the way I do it in a book.

31:54.348 --> 31:58.733
with these women as well as me.

31:58.753 --> 32:00.475
Could you feel the sexual energy, though?

32:00.655 --> 32:03.298
I mean, the way you've witnessed this, it's brilliant.

32:03.358 --> 32:07.663
It's one of the great sex scenes that I've read in the last 20 years, brilliant.

32:07.983 --> 32:19.676
Because it's, I mean, you can smell it from the horn, but I mean, they're all very uneasy by what they've seen, and they can't really identify what they feel from this, and they're mainly cracking jokes.

32:19.696 --> 32:20.778
Yeah, everyone thought it was a crack joke.

32:21.038 --> 32:22.920
And they're pretty funny jokes, but it's context.

32:23.356 --> 32:25.138
Yeah, the power of what they did.

32:25.218 --> 32:27.121
They're shot by what they did.

32:27.261 --> 32:27.741
I was shot.

32:28.643 --> 32:30.685
And you could feel the birds move.

32:31.426 --> 32:37.473
They were two, they were one-time, almost one-time.

32:37.493 --> 32:38.234
And they collied.

32:39.716 --> 32:40.017
BAM!

32:40.217 --> 32:42.059
And the rest of you have a guy who's shot.

32:42.179 --> 32:43.821
And there's a spear that's in there.

32:43.841 --> 32:44.883
You think he's going to get killed.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.084
The guider?

32:46.284 --> 32:49.228
Whatever you call it.

32:49.985 --> 32:56.934
Queen Mary, I think Elizabeth was talking about a song, the men on the sides had pulled down, trying to keep him right there.

32:56.954 --> 32:58.456
And where did you see this at?

32:58.596 --> 33:00.458
At this plantation that you visited?

33:00.558 --> 33:09.870
It was, I had gone to, this was a plantation of a developer, but it was not any of the first ones I had gone to.

33:09.890 --> 33:19.502
And I wouldn't have been there 60 years as a developer, I wasn't really trying to learn more about the plantation, I was trying to learn about the real estate.

33:19.972 --> 33:25.921
We had a lot of guests and wanted to give everybody a good time one day when we went shooting.

33:25.941 --> 33:35.235
And the other way, I then went to a horse breather from I know in Long Island.

33:35.255 --> 33:36.938
And he told me what I had just seen.

33:36.958 --> 33:47.734
I mean, I didn't know why that little guy was in there, fooling around with this enormous thing.

33:48.828 --> 33:52.113
And so I had a little technical guidance there with me.

33:52.133 --> 33:54.937
And also that thing with the teaser.

33:55.658 --> 33:56.699
That's how it works.

33:57.520 --> 34:01.086
That's how it works, there's a question mark there.

34:01.646 --> 34:05.051
That's, yeah, as far as I know, it's all there.

34:05.632 --> 34:13.904
Now when you see something like that, do you know instantly that that, you don't know how it's going to get into the book, but it has to get into the book down in your moment or so?

34:13.924 --> 34:15.005
And it's kind of a highway.

34:15.106 --> 34:18.210
Well, you know this dude, I'm sure, that when you're a reporter,

34:19.338 --> 34:35.055
you can be asking a lot of questions, and most of it is just rolling at your ears, and then, you know, they're responding to responses, and then finally there's something, you haven't even thought it out logically, but it happens all the time.

34:35.075 --> 34:36.416
You know you can use it.

34:36.436 --> 34:37.637
Well, it was one of those.

34:38.078 --> 34:45.666
Happened up on Mount Baptist last week, I mean, they made me go to church for four and a half hours, you know, in the Gaffin, it's very anamorphosis.

34:46.338 --> 35:12.598
these churches are a thousand years old and it's not like a regular church when you sit around here and it's extraordinary frescoes and eyebrows but it's the middle of night and the candles look out there so long and all of a sudden the sun came up and came through the windows and you could see the sun coming up and it started revealing these extraordinary frescoes and that to me was was as powerful as you know

35:13.338 --> 35:20.545
the religious, the spiritual stuff that was going on, and I said, in some way this gets, I use this.

35:21.125 --> 35:32.976
I don't know how relevant it is to what I'm doing, but this is pretty powerful stuff, the way the light finally started to reveal all of these things that were just in shadow for the last few hours.

35:33.076 --> 35:35.579
I'm sorry to go off on that.

35:35.639 --> 35:36.139
No, no, no, no.

35:36.159 --> 35:41.344
That's why you travel 5,000 miles to get epiphanous movements like this, I guess.

35:41.864 --> 35:42.585
Did you have your camera?

35:43.055 --> 35:51.749
I'm not inside the church, you can't shoot, but I shot, uh, easily, uh, .

35:51.769 --> 35:57.379
That's a great image, though, of light coming through, and that, uh, just, you hear them.

35:57.399 --> 36:04.611
You've heard about the, you know, the, the, the show at Thessaloniki, The Treasures of Mount Apple, so this is all that stuff, in situ, you know?

36:04.631 --> 36:06.093
Really, really something.

36:06.193 --> 36:06.774
I'm sorry to go on.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.477
No, I, I love it.

36:08.497 --> 36:09.619
Um, uh,

36:10.122 --> 36:14.747
where you can talk about the trophy wives syndrome and stuff like that and the race and the sex.

36:14.847 --> 36:20.513
This is still very much a part of our social, the fabric of American social life.

36:20.533 --> 36:21.955
Yes, to me it is.

36:21.995 --> 36:37.952
This piece, incidentally, in the time this morning about the monkeys gives them further credence to a neuroscientific finding of a couple of years ago that

36:38.692 --> 36:50.389
the male of the human species is a polygamous, is genetically polygamous by nature, and that nothing can be done about it.

36:50.409 --> 37:07.635
And it says that, this article based on the research of the monkey says that just for a male to see certain parts of the female anatomy will not only arouse him, it will build up his testosterone

37:08.172 --> 37:17.526
And the higher testosterone levels you have, the more confident you are, and the better you feel about life in general.

37:17.747 --> 37:19.089
You described that with the horse.

37:19.249 --> 37:19.910
Yeah.

37:19.930 --> 37:21.512
He gets a very big eyeful.

37:21.713 --> 37:24.777
I mean, yeah, I think it's testosterone.

37:25.198 --> 37:26.280
It's working.

37:26.540 --> 37:30.066
It's working over time.

37:30.086 --> 37:30.486
I'm sorry.

37:30.506 --> 37:31.207
No, no.

37:31.908 --> 37:34.973
So Trollope, I would say, is a kind of a

37:36.235 --> 37:41.461
In my case it would be Zola.

37:41.921 --> 37:44.004
Zola.

37:44.024 --> 37:47.628
I know that in certain ways I'm not much like Zola.

37:47.648 --> 37:51.072
Zola writes very funny scenes, but he doesn't play them for laughs.

37:52.393 --> 37:54.195
They're, they become serious.

37:54.316 --> 37:56.578
He doesn't think they're anything funny.

37:56.598 --> 38:00.683
But his technique of, he used to call it documents.

38:00.703 --> 38:02.665
He'd go after the mind.

38:03.421 --> 38:10.368
You go out to the mines and go down in the mine shafts and get the tail for a gym in the hall, for example.

38:10.388 --> 38:16.073
Go into the French slums to get the wash houses where people get down laundry and other things.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.074
Do you feel the same way?

38:18.095 --> 38:18.876
I feel the same way.

38:19.176 --> 38:20.197
How about the prisons, then?

38:20.397 --> 38:21.738
How did you get that?

38:21.758 --> 38:23.060
I went to the prisons.

38:23.240 --> 38:23.900
Santa Rita.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.584
Santa Rita has been replaced by a modern jail.

38:28.024 --> 38:32.989
But when I was there, it was the old Santa Rita.

38:33.256 --> 38:39.903
The doors were not barred.

38:39.923 --> 38:43.926
They were solid slabs of wood like a hatch on a ship.

38:44.507 --> 38:52.495
And the ceilings were wire, wire mesh, so you could hear everything that went on in the place.

38:52.855 --> 38:56.399
And, you know, I was just there.

38:56.539 --> 39:01.744
I couldn't sit there for the day and watch all this stuff take place.

39:01.893 --> 39:08.102
I went there to, I think, to visit a friend who was in Santa Rita.

39:09.244 --> 39:17.315
And I later had a chance to interview him and several other former inmates of Santa Rita.

39:17.335 --> 39:26.509
And they'd tell me all this stuff about, you know, the rap sessions at night and the homosexual rapes and... The masturbation.

39:26.549 --> 39:31.596
The masturbation, which I... In fact, one guy told me it was exactly the phrase he used to...

39:31.998 --> 39:37.349
If the guys get masturbated on my way, that place would have been ripped up out of the earth and turned over.

39:37.890 --> 39:50.918
Well, I was at an aircraft carrier for three years, and there was a guy who said, it's crude, but he said, I drift off in the shower so much that now every time it wakes, I get a higher on.

39:52.298 --> 39:56.345
I mean, it's prison.

39:56.405 --> 40:03.076
You know, going to prison is a lot like going to sea in a ship, only in a ship you'll be out of danger of drowning.

40:03.677 --> 40:11.671
We've got to talk about Conrad, because a number of the reviewers have said, and I do agree with him on this, that you play him straight.

40:11.751 --> 40:18.222
I mean, he treated him with the utmost respect and sensitivity, and I mean, he is not the object of any kind of

40:19.062 --> 40:20.383
You're not smiling at him.

40:21.444 --> 40:25.768
He's really a unique character, may I say.

40:25.988 --> 40:34.376
I want him to be someone who has had everything flipped away.

40:34.456 --> 40:37.038
He's really going to affect a lot of his life.

40:37.058 --> 40:40.401
He has no more interest than you now than you can say it all.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.282
It is intermediate.

40:41.402 --> 40:41.843
It's obvious.

40:41.883 --> 40:42.583
Such is the case.

40:43.264 --> 40:45.206
He's not coming back after the first day.

40:45.726 --> 40:47.668
The parents were useless.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.362
He doesn't have a circle of friends.

40:50.582 --> 40:58.132
He just moved to the fifth place, fifth place, California, which is a kind of place he was going to live in.

40:58.152 --> 40:59.174
It was a very, very good place.

40:59.194 --> 41:01.737
I went out there to see him.

41:01.757 --> 41:09.368
And I also wanted him to be a member of the first generation after God.

41:09.388 --> 41:18.600
I get this concept from one of the books written, a novel by Douglas Copeland, and the title is Life After God.

41:19.508 --> 41:21.010
His insight was wonderful.

41:21.030 --> 41:22.693
This is the first book.

41:22.833 --> 41:26.719
The Generation X, as he also gave it that name.

41:26.739 --> 41:28.682
Generation X. That was his first book.

41:28.702 --> 41:28.922
Yes.

41:30.184 --> 41:31.826
That was his first book.

41:31.846 --> 41:33.669
And Life After God, I didn't see much about it.

41:34.090 --> 41:35.432
It's a wonderful book.

41:35.452 --> 41:40.499
It's about the people whose own parents didn't believe in God.

41:40.519 --> 41:43.023
So how are they going to believe in God?

41:43.043 --> 41:45.907
And as in Conrad's case, they didn't even know what prayer was.

41:46.889 --> 41:48.992
Conrad stopped praying for this and didn't know what to do.

41:49.833 --> 41:57.905
Um, that, that whole idea intrigued me to, you have someone, everything's been stripped away, you have no religion.

41:57.925 --> 42:04.675
Um, see how you can cope with the, with the, with the situation and by the stroke of luck.

42:06.137 --> 42:07.639
I'm looking for that, by the way.

42:08.300 --> 42:14.950
Uh, he orders a, a book called The Stoic's Game, and you get a book called The Stoic's.

42:14.970 --> 42:15.091
Yeah.

42:15.111 --> 42:18.135
But, it, it coincides that, at least,

42:18.824 --> 42:21.888
These are factors in life, and people say, well, it's a coincidence.

42:21.908 --> 42:26.053
But life revolves around so many coincidences.

42:26.173 --> 42:27.955
I thought that was a pretty believable thing.

42:28.035 --> 42:28.756
I think so.

42:28.796 --> 42:32.400
In the jail, you only get books from a publisher.

42:32.420 --> 42:32.981
I know that.

42:33.201 --> 42:40.409
Stephen Blumberg, my book thief, the only way we could send him the book was my publisher had to send him the book in prison.

42:40.429 --> 42:42.632
I couldn't inscribe a copy and send it to him.

42:42.732 --> 42:45.996
He had to send a copy from Holt.

42:46.178 --> 42:49.802
I'd forgotten that case, but that was quite funny.

42:49.822 --> 42:49.923
Yeah.

42:49.943 --> 42:51.064
But it was just the same thing.

42:51.084 --> 42:52.125
They had it sent in.

42:52.145 --> 42:54.588
They had it come from the publishing house.

42:54.688 --> 42:55.269
I'm sorry.

42:55.289 --> 43:14.312
And one of the inmates told me about this one guy that I was talking to, I was talking to him, the first one saying that it was so rotten in that jail, he took this book and ripped the covers off it and gave him the face.

43:15.035 --> 43:20.181
plotted a bunch of folios, and, uh, and his princess.

43:20.502 --> 43:23.826
Oh, man, I wish I could get my hands on the book covers.

43:23.846 --> 43:29.492
You know, you could make it into a good, a good shank, yeah.

43:30.894 --> 43:32.096
I don't know, I just loved all that.

43:32.156 --> 43:41.707
And then when you had stuff like that, again, it's, uh... Are you taking notes when you're doing this, or you pretty much... Most of this I did not take notes on the, uh, scene.

43:41.767 --> 43:44.130
I was, as soon as I could get alone,

43:44.735 --> 43:51.982
I always thought that a lot of the stuff was sensitive and taking notes and just upset people.

43:52.002 --> 43:54.665
As soon as I had a chance to sit down, I'd write.

43:54.685 --> 43:57.047
Am I pretty much just my time up to 30?

43:57.147 --> 44:03.994
No, but I think about a few years arriving, so I'm going to go down and tell me to stay at the mall for a little bit.

44:04.114 --> 44:04.375
Good.

44:06.056 --> 44:09.780
You think you're like 5 to 5 or 5 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10.

44:11.583 --> 44:18.950
Is this the case in that you describe certain political things in Atlanta about buying votes and stuff like this?

44:18.970 --> 44:22.554
Well, I couldn't get it on T on the Square, too, but that's my best knowledge.

44:22.574 --> 44:24.556
And apparently it's true everywhere.

44:25.056 --> 44:34.186
When we talk about this get-out-the-vote money, it's not to hire sound trucks.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.208
Do you see a movie coming out of this?

44:38.110 --> 44:41.573
I really don't, because two producers, and I know them both,

44:42.194 --> 44:48.207
I've shaken their heads that they can't think of any way to do it in even three hours.

44:50.652 --> 45:02.076
And actually I will not cut my wrist if there's no movie deal because the last debacle, the last one such a debacle that kind of turned me off of it.

45:02.461 --> 45:04.263
It's hard to do it.

45:04.383 --> 45:09.007
I can see where it would take five to eight hours to do this.

45:09.027 --> 45:13.290
If you're doing the whole thing, there's so many flops in the evening.

45:14.932 --> 45:32.147
Do you have a sense of, and at least this is a big word, and when I ask an author about the I'd prepare career and the corpus and how this fits in, is it, for you, a body of work that absolutely follows?

45:32.482 --> 45:39.430
Well, there was a long recession in the continuum in 1987.

45:39.970 --> 45:41.932
Well, I think so.

45:42.033 --> 45:49.140
To me, writing fiction still has a novelty about it.

45:49.160 --> 46:01.594
I get an awful lot of nonfiction and enjoy it and do think that literary nonfiction is probably the most important

46:02.654 --> 46:11.407
movement since the Second World War, particularly since the novel has become more and more precious.

46:11.427 --> 46:18.478
There's a novelist who has a new book that's done called Thumbsuckers.

46:18.498 --> 46:26.931
It's about a man who sucks his thumb until the age of 21, and he was an author himself, sucks his thumb until he was 19.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.493
And I kind of think of

46:29.030 --> 46:41.465
What is being done generally in the novel today is thumb-sucking, the thumb-sucking novel, in which having cannibalized the first 20-yard years of your life, you begin finally to suck your thumb.

46:41.485 --> 46:48.954
I mean, because that sort of hopes that there's something left on your bones that you might turn into fiction.

46:48.974 --> 46:50.195
Now, this is a traditional novel?

46:50.876 --> 46:53.219
This is a... In terms of structure?

46:53.319 --> 46:54.821
This is a traditional 19th-century novel.

46:54.841 --> 46:56.142
That's what I was about to say.

46:56.162 --> 46:58.345
It's a traditional 19th-century novel, and yet...

46:59.101 --> 47:03.405
And yet, people are responding by the hundreds of thousands.

47:03.425 --> 47:12.835
That's because there are certain laws that you can break only into apparel.

47:13.455 --> 47:19.401
The realism I did was developing the novel, it was a very recent thing.

47:19.521 --> 47:26.188
It only goes back to the 18th century.

47:26.557 --> 47:28.279
And you finally get up into the 19th century.

47:28.299 --> 47:33.106
It's fairly late that you get novels with a point of view where you look through a character's eyes.

47:33.247 --> 47:35.870
And even Zola doesn't have your point of view.

47:35.970 --> 47:37.813
You can get kind of split, split his in and out.

47:38.134 --> 47:41.098
Henry James puts forth the notion that every scene should be true.

47:41.578 --> 47:42.800
Somebody's.

47:43.581 --> 47:44.262
All right.

47:44.362 --> 47:45.845
It's a good lesson.

47:45.865 --> 47:49.350
But we're talking about a relatively short span of time.

47:49.370 --> 47:55.939
And then by the late, by the end of the 19th century, really when I've been really, I couldn't say really, been truly about

47:56.425 --> 47:59.948
into a powerful, powerful form.

48:00.428 --> 48:17.043
For a novelist of the 20th century, to give up realism—I mean, when we started doing it in this country, in the second part of the century—to give up realism, there's just an engineer where to say, look, I'm tired of this whole business of electricity.

48:17.483 --> 48:18.304
It's been done to death.

48:18.624 --> 48:23.288
My God, the electric bulb was invented in 1879, or whatever.

48:23.889 --> 48:26.331
And I'm going to push into the future.

48:26.598 --> 48:27.499
I'm not going to use it.

48:27.519 --> 48:29.521
No more electricity for me."

48:29.541 --> 48:41.013
Well, this poor guy would be doomed to pay, because electricity gets down to something so basic in a computational matter that you can't advance physics without it.

48:41.734 --> 48:45.838
Well, it's the same thing with realism and literature, according to my concern.

48:47.159 --> 48:55.828
That has given literature a power that has never been, and cannot be used to have.

48:56.534 --> 49:04.646
for a technical reason, for what kind of literature does, is jogging humor.

49:04.666 --> 49:07.510
You know, try to describe in the woods a face.

49:07.971 --> 49:11.956
It's a terrible mess.

49:11.976 --> 49:14.540
You have a lot of those effortlessly.

49:14.640 --> 49:26.237
So you have to do what Solzhenitsyn, for example, does.

49:28.495 --> 49:32.801
It had a face that looked like it had been stamped on by a pole.

49:34.364 --> 49:38.169
It just gives you an idea of what this face looked like.

49:40.753 --> 49:49.947
But the Richard Reed memories that you can evoke, more complex, the Richard Reed

49:50.737 --> 49:54.583
the greater the impact of the writing and the rich of the picture that you're reading yet.

49:54.823 --> 50:01.092
This is a technical reason why you cannot give up realism without giving up the power of the novel.

50:02.134 --> 50:09.044
Unfortunately, or unfortunately for me, I'm the only person who seems to understand this very basic, simple fact.

50:09.425 --> 50:13.230
And I used to worry about handing other writers to Jesus' opinions, you know.

50:14.172 --> 50:16.455
But I see now there's a lot to worry about.

50:16.475 --> 50:19.680
They're all, uh, they're all wed to some sucking.

50:20.217 --> 50:30.389
They were going to these interviews, and you say, well, I think I know my lead, and I don't want to leave until that, but I don't like to leave until I have my kicker, you know, and I think you just gave me the kicker.

50:30.710 --> 50:34.094
You had, are you confident about, I mean, can you give me a quote for the future?

50:34.194 --> 50:39.681
I mean, just one other thing, that I don't, you sound like I just, you know, I'm the whole balding in this.

50:39.701 --> 50:46.149
There are writers that I admire, and particularly Richard Price, Falkers and Freedom Land.

50:46.169 --> 50:48.532
He's gone out like a reporter.

50:48.552 --> 50:49.633
He's got a fabulous,

50:50.170 --> 51:07.696
We talked about race, black and white.

51:07.716 --> 51:10.761
The blue blood blacks, very interesting.

51:11.568 --> 51:18.077
And I think that's an important type of material for a novel, and I think he's not ever brought up anymore.

51:18.097 --> 51:30.014
And when you talk about the architecture, you should really, you know, why does architecture have to be black or white, or the, you know... But getting it right is very important to you, isn't it?

51:30.034 --> 51:40.208
I mean, you know, retrospectively, the nuances... And this really is an example of where the novel does give you a... I mean, it's been said, Bonfire is the best book

51:40.492 --> 51:44.396
about the 1980s that you're going to read, fact or fiction.

51:44.416 --> 51:54.688
I mean, I don't think any book is going to describe that madness that went on down in that part of the island better than that novel.

51:54.788 --> 51:57.651
I mean, but is this a function of the novel in your view?

51:57.951 --> 52:10.465
It is, in my view, and when you said that, it made me think of John P. Marquand, his sociological picture of, you've referred

52:11.407 --> 52:13.609
in Massachusetts.

52:14.590 --> 52:22.738
He's really better than W. L. Warner's sociological question, although Warner was quite okay.

52:22.758 --> 52:24.920
Can help being a native southerner in this book?

52:25.421 --> 52:25.901
Probably.

52:26.202 --> 52:37.853
I was, I think I had somewhat of an ear for the way it was spoken, even though it was not exactly the way it was spoken in Virginia.

52:38.693 --> 52:46.664
But I had to learn an awful lot about Atlanta nonetheless because Atlanta is a sort of New South that I've never seen.

52:46.684 --> 52:49.568
And yet it's not a really old, as you point out, which I wasn't aware of.

52:49.588 --> 52:51.611
It's not one of these old traditional cities.

52:51.631 --> 52:56.037
It's really a development of the last 150 years or something like that.

52:56.117 --> 52:59.762
And these plantations are not old family enterprises.

52:59.782 --> 53:04.549
A new set of entrepreneurs comes through every cycle and starts

53:05.440 --> 53:18.358
And from the stock market to real estate, that was a, that was really a... Now that was a fairly, I must say, I had the notion fairly early of meeting, having a real estate figure and everything.

53:18.758 --> 53:31.836
The two great engines that drove the economy in the 80s were investment banking, which is basically mainly a bond business in, in real estate development.

53:32.491 --> 53:46.388
I started to think in 89 when the, well, the impact of the deep concession of 87 to 96 hadn't really been felt yet.

53:46.408 --> 53:53.897
It was by late 80 and 90, there was a lot of trimming when we developed or something was happening.

53:54.258 --> 53:58.142
And then the next 90, it was, they started hitting about it.

53:58.163 --> 53:58.583
So those two things.

53:59.137 --> 54:06.348
went hand-in-hand, but I was certainly in the midst of unbridled wealth.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.993
Of course, you can hear a few things out of Atlanta.

54:11.276 --> 54:17.506
Is there any anxiety about what people might think or who's who?

54:17.867 --> 54:19.890
No, I'm looking forward to my trip trip line.

54:20.691 --> 54:23.816
I'm going, I think it's the 17th and 18th of this month.

54:24.297 --> 54:24.958
There was a

54:29.849 --> 54:42.341
review of the Journal Constitution, although it did, it did acknowledge my accurate picture of the city.

54:43.442 --> 54:52.791
It said that I had made the, the black leadership kind of too enlightened and too statement-like.

54:53.432 --> 54:58.877
Well, I don't quite get that complaint, because in this the black mayor,

54:59.414 --> 55:04.919
called the press conference in order to announce a virtual crisis which didn't exist.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.041
It didn't even exist, sir.

55:06.921 --> 55:11.866
I don't... It seems to me that is not exactly where... Let me describe this with you.

55:19.034 --> 55:20.655
And that's the competition.

55:20.675 --> 55:20.775
Okay.

55:20.955 --> 55:22.417
Sorry, I've had my out.

55:22.477 --> 55:22.817
It was great.

55:24.279 --> 55:25.680
Did you have fun with this, by the way?

55:26.081 --> 55:27.582
Did you have fun doing this book?

55:27.663 --> 55:28.144
I did.

55:28.344 --> 55:29.986
No, I was doing a break on this.

55:30.006 --> 55:32.249
Atlanta was exciting.

55:32.269 --> 55:32.870
And what's next?

55:33.191 --> 55:33.872
Another novel?

55:34.512 --> 55:37.817
Yeah, a novel on education.

55:38.197 --> 55:38.738
Really?

55:38.758 --> 55:39.099
Yeah.

55:39.119 --> 55:40.200
Set in any particular place?

55:40.320 --> 55:40.841
No, I haven't.

55:40.901 --> 55:44.266
I don't even know what branch... I'll be done in two seconds.

55:44.406 --> 55:51.115
I don't even know what branch is the education, whether it'll be a school, high school, cut school, college, or all three.

55:52.116 --> 55:54.700
But I'll say page 33 here.

55:56.232 --> 56:02.480
I was going to get a nice fresh one and have you do that.

56:02.500 --> 56:07.486
I said, no, I treasure this one more.

56:07.506 --> 56:08.207
This has been great.

56:08.408 --> 56:09.509
Thanks a lot.

56:09.729 --> 56:14.415
And I'm doing this from an awful lot of publications, you know, Philadelphia Inquirer, I do about 20 papers.

56:14.435 --> 56:14.936
Oh, is that right?

56:16.157 --> 56:21.044
I do a magazine piece, so we'll be doing that feature for a biblio.

56:23.026 --> 56:26.070
So you have, you have, you're optimistic about the novel?

56:26.371 --> 56:40.385
No, I'm not, unless—if young writers would take my very simple advice, I wouldn't have any worries at all.

56:40.966 --> 56:48.173
But as long as they try to forsake realism, I don't see any hope.

56:48.554 --> 56:52.558
So many young writers now are not writing.

56:52.578 --> 56:53.579
They're going to film.

56:53.599 --> 56:54.640
They're going to television.

56:54.907 --> 56:56.990
A lot of money in the engine, I think.

56:57.010 --> 57:01.596
Actually, it's also excitement, though, because this is where the action is.

57:02.858 --> 57:04.099
But the novel remains imminent.

57:04.119 --> 57:05.801
You can still do it all.

57:06.943 --> 57:10.648
And do you, how long do you think it's going to take you to do this next novel?

57:10.888 --> 57:21.122
Well, I, I, I've betrayed my own vows before, but I'm, will be desperately unhappy if I don't do this in three years.

57:21.422 --> 57:21.943
A little bit.

57:21.963 --> 57:23.665
I should have said that probably, but that's a little bit.

57:30.445 --> 57:32.650
You know, it's about the art.

57:32.670 --> 57:35.856
I can tell stories on art more than I can.

57:36.377 --> 57:38.522
Yeah, I want art.

57:38.542 --> 57:39.083
Oh, is that right?

57:39.364 --> 57:40.686
They're talking about paintings?

57:40.707 --> 57:42.711
No, they're talking about pictures for the newspapers.

57:43.512 --> 57:43.613
Ah.

57:43.653 --> 57:44.895
That's a whole newspaper term.

57:44.955 --> 57:46.018
What kind of art have you got?

57:46.138 --> 57:47.020
Oh, that's fine, yeah.

57:47.040 --> 57:50.968
They might have colored pictures to go with these stories.
