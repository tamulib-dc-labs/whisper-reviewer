WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:19.490
Well, tell me about, let's just enter generally if we can.

00:20.171 --> 00:24.196
Is this the flip side of how we die, as some of the reviewers have been suggesting?

00:24.517 --> 00:27.861
Yeah, well, one of the interesting things that's happened is that

00:28.060 --> 00:33.491
In at least half of the reviews, the headline is How We Live, and they just can't resist that.

00:34.213 --> 00:37.780
Or if they don't do that, it's in the body of the review somewhere.

00:38.321 --> 00:39.784
I don't know that it's the flip side.

00:39.904 --> 00:44.794
I think it's a continuation of this thing, we're all interested in the human condition.

00:46.658 --> 00:48.482
I like that.

00:49.323 --> 00:54.388
I consider my new book a companion to my earlier book and not in any way a sequel.

00:54.408 --> 00:55.309
Well, that's right.

00:55.329 --> 00:56.290
It's a body of work.

00:56.310 --> 01:00.654
You're broadening your consideration of the subject, it seems to me.

01:00.674 --> 01:05.619
If you're really a nonfiction writer, it's because you're fascinated with a huge area.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.383
So you write a book that has to do with part of that area.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.065
The next book is going to grow out of the same area.

01:12.746 --> 01:18.672
My fascination is with the human, well, you might say the function

01:19.141 --> 01:20.663
You might say the culture.

01:21.344 --> 01:23.326
You might say everything we are.

01:24.047 --> 01:25.648
And that's why I went into medicine.

01:26.089 --> 01:36.361
I remember so well, and I was thinking about it just the other day because I came across an old autograph book from sixth grade where it said, profession.

01:36.561 --> 01:38.022
I had written biologist.

01:38.143 --> 01:44.169
And I remember that so clearly that I was intrigued by biology.

01:44.189 --> 01:44.710
You know, I had

01:45.263 --> 01:50.830
found some animals on one of our field trips and dissected them and done stuff like this.

01:51.631 --> 02:03.826
And I, anatomy and physiology, especially physiology, how these things work, intrigued me, fascinated me, magnetized me because I didn't know anything about it and I wanted to learn more.

02:03.886 --> 02:11.836
I was a little bit like a young John Hunter in that regard, except he had a greater imagination than I do.

02:12.457 --> 02:14.359
So when it came time

02:15.014 --> 02:28.237
to choose a college course, and we had these categories, the only category that seemed to fit my interest in how the body worked with being with people.

02:28.297 --> 02:30.681
I always needed to be with people.

02:30.702 --> 02:39.537
I always felt that my education came from conversations, from contact, and that had a lot to do with my family upbringing.

02:39.820 --> 02:42.302
What combined an interest in biology?

02:42.342 --> 02:44.484
Well, the only thing that fit was medicine.

02:44.505 --> 02:47.567
So it's not as if I was burning to become a doctor.

02:48.288 --> 02:53.934
I was burning to learn about how human beings get on in this world.

02:55.115 --> 02:57.837
In fact, there's a line in How We Die.

02:58.758 --> 03:05.845
You know, you write things and you forget about them, and three years later you write something else, and it's, my God, of course, it's prescient.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.461
It's prescient.

03:07.481 --> 03:09.183
In Doctors I wrote it.

03:09.203 --> 03:12.688
In Doctors I wrote this big thing about the human spirit and the introduction.

03:13.168 --> 03:15.511
And whoever thought I'd be writing a book about the human spirit.

03:15.531 --> 03:18.054
Of course the spirit comes into this book again, doesn't it?

03:18.074 --> 03:18.434
Right.

03:18.795 --> 03:20.116
In a profound way, I think.

03:20.136 --> 03:22.840
Well, in How We Die, I say this thing.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.022
I am not interested in the cosmos.

03:25.483 --> 03:29.307
I'm interested in the microcosm, how we make our way in the world.

03:30.208 --> 03:34.093
So this became largely an outgrowth of that.

03:34.563 --> 03:45.193
And I have to tell you that Glenn suggested that this would be a very good way to continue to explore my interest, the book about the human body.

03:45.814 --> 03:52.380
Of course, his concept, as it always is, was rather skeletal, talk about anatomy and physiology.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.823
That's the best way, though, to get an idea and let you develop it.

03:55.843 --> 03:56.404
Yeah, that's right.

03:56.444 --> 04:04.131
It becomes your own, and you create it, embroider it, construct it any way you want to.

04:04.685 --> 04:20.640
The wisdom of the body becomes a continuation of my, I know it sounds grandiose, personal exploration of what we are, what human society is, what individual human beings are, and why they interact with each other the way they do.

04:21.722 --> 04:25.445
And it's always been my contention.

04:26.106 --> 04:32.532
I've never understood that except for philosophers, except for Aristotle, philosophers

04:33.743 --> 04:46.216
have never taken into account, when they try to describe how our minds work and what we are and what the universe is, they've never taken into account the equipment that we come with.

04:46.236 --> 04:54.884
They've never taken into account, except in a very vague way, what the brain can do, what the heart can do, what the circulation can do.

04:56.586 --> 05:02.552
So wouldn't it be good to introduce into the whole philosophical discussion

05:05.013 --> 05:15.125
the notion that human biology is, in fact, a major factor in the way we see the world, in the way we see each other.

05:16.006 --> 05:29.661
So I wouldn't want to embroider what I've done by calling it philosophy, but it's meant to be a contribution to people's understanding of culture and individuals.

05:29.721 --> 05:33.906
What you do as exquisitely designed as the human body is,

05:34.409 --> 05:36.893
It does come with its occasional flaws, doesn't it?

05:36.913 --> 05:38.014
You bet, doesn't it?

05:38.034 --> 05:38.215
Yeah.

05:38.235 --> 05:47.809
And this seems to be where someone like yourself enters the equation, so to speak.

05:48.129 --> 05:49.511
Well, yeah.

05:49.772 --> 05:54.599
And we'll probably, no matter how we evolve, we probably won't evolve anymore.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.122
We're always going to have those flaws.

05:57.563 --> 05:58.885
You don't think we'll evolve anymore?

05:58.905 --> 05:58.965
No.

05:59.249 --> 06:07.241
You know, I've had this out with one of my molecular biology friends at great length, so I've looked into it very carefully.

06:07.261 --> 06:20.481
Except for responses to certain environmental changes like new infectious diseases, certain climatic changes apparently in other parts of the world, there's no evidence.

06:21.018 --> 06:29.426
that we have evolved beyond the appearance of so-called modern Homo sapiens between 25,000 and 40,000 years ago.

06:29.446 --> 06:33.691
But evolution takes a much longer period than that.

06:33.711 --> 06:38.916
Yeah, but evolution... I guess we probably control it at some point.

06:39.096 --> 06:51.008
Evolution is in response to environmental dangers, and we've made ourselves so independent of the environment that there's no need for natural selection anymore,

06:51.325 --> 07:00.636
I mean, suppose a mutation occurred in which one could resist temperatures of 20 below zero.

07:00.676 --> 07:07.243
That would have been a great thing in caveman times, and that person, you know, or those mutations would have become dominant.

07:07.764 --> 07:10.767
But big deal, who cares?

07:11.048 --> 07:13.671
So it's just going to die out.

07:13.691 --> 07:19.037
There's a recent book, Harvard University Press, Freeman Dyson, Imagine the World.

07:19.253 --> 07:19.994
fascinating.

07:20.054 --> 07:21.917
I don't know the book, of course, I know Dyson.

07:21.937 --> 07:29.048
But I do, and I thought he's thinking about, you know, not only life a hundred years from now, but a thousand years from now.

07:29.068 --> 07:29.168
Yeah.

07:29.268 --> 07:40.224
But he's putting a very, I mean, it's not science fiction, it's really a brilliant physicist thinking about it, and he never once mentions evolution, and it's very interesting.

07:40.244 --> 07:41.566
It's all cultural evolution.

07:41.586 --> 07:41.987
It really is.

07:42.107 --> 07:43.168
He doesn't talk about it.

07:43.229 --> 07:48.957
He has no, he has nothing to offer on how the body might, I hadn't thought of that until this

07:49.240 --> 07:50.722
But I'll bet he thought about it.

07:50.882 --> 07:57.469
I'll bet he thought about it and decided there was no point because there's not going to be any change.

07:59.772 --> 08:07.581
So this is a continued... Of course, as you said, Glenn suggested the way to continue the exploration.

08:07.721 --> 08:11.064
It was kind of a skeletal suggestion.

08:12.366 --> 08:12.867
What is it?

08:13.167 --> 08:18.673
To me, it's gripping is the fact that you do accomplish this through example.

08:19.244 --> 08:49.183
individual stories I mean explain to me why that is how it happens that this is the way that you choose to but that's the clinical physician in me and my interest my basic interest if I had to choose between the elements of biology and physiology on the one hand and what human beings do on the other hand I would always opt for human beings and that's why

08:49.720 --> 08:56.907
When I finished medical school, I elected a career in clinical work, taking care of sick people rather than a career in research.

08:57.828 --> 09:05.255
So I can't even think about physiology without thinking about how it works in people.

09:06.236 --> 09:19.609
And so when I write, it's just a natural thing, after I talk about, let's say, how the heart works, to immediately go off and talk about somebody I know whose heart perhaps didn't work so well.

09:19.842 --> 09:24.527
which would illustrate what can be done and what the defect is.

09:25.028 --> 09:29.673
So this has always been the way I think, and therefore it's natural for me to write that way.

09:29.693 --> 09:34.619
But the drama of these stories, I mean, the very first one with that woman.

09:36.862 --> 09:38.564
Just reading that, you're sweating.

09:38.664 --> 09:42.188
I mean, this human being is about to expire.

09:43.630 --> 09:49.056
Do you know, I was doing a reading the first week, actually before the book took,

09:49.643 --> 10:16.933
doing a reading at the yale co-op and she walked in with her husband it was like the sun was shining around her it was the most terrific thing then in a case like this obviously you must talk to the individuals that were right about this oh yes oh yes and that that that's not her name i think that is her name oh she yeah then that is you changed yeah the doctors i challenged the doctors i did at the last second i think for obvious reasons because they they never called her

10:17.048 --> 10:19.731
They didn't have a clue, but I did it at the last second.

10:19.751 --> 10:26.960
I was going to use their names, and then I thought, you know, in actual fact, these guys screwed this thing up.

10:27.061 --> 10:30.465
They should have realized she wasn't bleeding from a tule pregnancy.

10:31.967 --> 10:35.491
They needn't have panicked quite so much.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.773
I don't know.

10:37.414 --> 10:40.397
So I decided I would just change this.

10:40.417 --> 10:43.261
But everybody in New Haven, number one, knows who they are.

10:43.281 --> 10:46.465
Number two, their names are so close to their real names.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.673
I'm not going to put that in a piece.

10:48.893 --> 10:51.096
It's pretty interesting.

10:52.317 --> 10:54.200
Did you ever read John Wolf's The Right Stuff?

10:55.301 --> 10:55.522
No.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.809
He compares, you know, fighter pilots with the right stuff.

11:01.189 --> 11:14.106
He said the only comparison he could make, I mean, with his standards and all sorts of masters of the universe, is a surgeon, you know, as a doctor.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.034
Don't misunderstand me.

11:16.054 --> 11:18.279
A person who feels supremely confident.

11:18.299 --> 11:18.659
Oh, yeah.

11:18.680 --> 11:26.135
And almost the ebullience that you feel, the sense of elation.

11:26.276 --> 11:30.464
I mean, this is not frustration and sadness and anger.

11:30.505 --> 11:31.467
It's exhilaration.

11:31.847 --> 11:35.014
All this blood for me, I would probably collapse, you know.

11:35.332 --> 11:36.193
At the sight of it.

11:36.233 --> 11:43.343
Yeah, of course you wouldn't because you would be so well trained by the time you ever got into a situation where you're responsible for that.

11:43.463 --> 11:49.651
And that's the element that I think people who haven't been in such situations don't quite comprehend.

11:49.852 --> 11:51.274
Training is everything.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.175
Of course, selection.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.880
And you have to pre-select these people to have a certain personality type.

11:56.641 --> 12:01.828
But by the time they get through with a fighter pilot or we get through with a young surgeon,

12:02.872 --> 12:05.455
He is prepared for just about anything.

12:05.495 --> 12:13.203
Now, granted, every once in a while, a kid does collapse and find that he can't handle it or has to rush for help.

12:13.283 --> 12:22.473
But by and large, my old professor of cardiac surgery used to say, an emergency prepared for is not an emergency.

12:23.094 --> 12:32.524
And we sort of click over in our minds before a routine operation, every single thing that could possibly go wrong, and we are ready for it.

12:33.263 --> 12:43.499
The other thing that's always interested me, ever since I finished training and became an attending surgeon on my own, is the intense need for equanimity.

12:44.180 --> 12:54.315
That even if you feel yourself starting to lose it, you know that if there's any evidence that you lose it, everybody in the room is going to lose it and it's going to be over.

12:55.156 --> 12:57.059
So you kind of grab a hold of yourself.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.283
Some of it is just sheer willpower.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.925
You grab a hold of yourself.

13:01.158 --> 13:03.561
And you don't let yourself get nervous.

13:04.282 --> 13:19.983
Now, granted, a lot of people can't not let themselves get nervous, but it's important to bear in mind how many times you have seen dreadful things in an operating room and almost always they turn out well.

13:21.184 --> 13:21.845
Oh, yeah.

13:21.865 --> 13:27.132
And that's what I always would tell myself when I was starting to feel, oh, my God, this is overwhelming.

13:27.618 --> 13:36.666
the fact that I have in my life almost never seen a real disaster occur in a modern operating room, that we always get out of it.

13:36.806 --> 13:38.787
We always figure out a way out of it.

13:39.128 --> 13:40.609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:40.629 --> 13:44.592
Yeah, disasters are for television and the movies.

13:45.153 --> 13:53.220
Modern surgeons are so well trained and have such extraordinary backup that they'll get out of most anything.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.203
So this phrase, dying on the table,

13:57.858 --> 13:59.961
It really doesn't happen that often.

13:59.981 --> 14:01.203
I had a 30-year career.

14:01.664 --> 14:14.823
I saw two patients die on the table, on my table, on my table, and each time they were almost dead by the time we started operating, and it was done in desperation, and when they died, you know, okay.

14:15.925 --> 14:27.021
But dying on the table, except in cardiac cases where anything can go wild because of an arrhythmia that's uncontrollable, with very, very sick hearts,

14:27.355 --> 14:28.977
is quite unusual.

14:29.979 --> 14:31.060
That's very reassuring.

14:31.381 --> 14:33.063
It should be reassuring.

14:33.564 --> 14:47.985
In the case with Marge, though, where you talk about how you plan for different exigencies and things that might go wrong, you literally walked into this situation, and this had to be done seat of the pants.

14:48.125 --> 14:48.365
Right.

14:48.866 --> 14:56.417
But what saved Marge is that I knew a sure way to cut off all the blood supply to the ambulance.

14:56.617 --> 14:58.259
which is to put my hand on that.

14:58.299 --> 14:59.181
That was your fallback.

14:59.561 --> 15:00.623
That was my fallback.

15:00.643 --> 15:02.725
That allowed you time to figure out what was going on.

15:03.066 --> 15:07.312
You know, my first experience with that, I was a medical student.

15:07.332 --> 15:14.301
I was a third-year medical student, and I was operating with a senior professor of urology, and he was 70, and he shouldn't have been operating anymore.

15:14.582 --> 15:15.743
But he was a great man.

15:15.844 --> 15:19.789
He was a great international figure, and no one could tell him to stop operating.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.604
And he put a tie down on the artery of the kidney, and it lifted.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.785
The artery broke.

15:25.845 --> 15:30.329
It was so sclerotic from arteriosclerosis, it broke.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.552
And he just fell apart.

15:34.412 --> 15:37.876
And the resident packed the wound to try to stop it.

15:38.296 --> 15:40.698
And my job was to press on the packing.

15:40.818 --> 15:42.179
You know, I was an intern.

15:42.239 --> 15:43.541
I was 24 years old.

15:44.001 --> 15:45.703
All my mind, I was pressing like this.

15:46.023 --> 15:49.506
They called in the chief of cardiac surgery, who opened the chest.

15:50.363 --> 15:52.325
and got the aorta in the chest.

15:52.565 --> 15:54.528
So this guy came in to the rescue.

15:54.588 --> 15:56.730
Right, and the patient was saved.

15:57.631 --> 16:00.634
Now, I never forgot that.

16:00.654 --> 16:04.158
The only thing I could think to myself, why the hell do you have to open the chest to do that?

16:04.218 --> 16:06.921
Why can't you just get the aorta below the diaphragm?

16:07.742 --> 16:12.167
Which would have been a perfectly straight, but everybody was getting kind of excited, you know.

16:12.227 --> 16:15.811
The old man was involved, the great professor.

16:15.831 --> 16:17.353
He had pulled back at this point, right?

16:17.373 --> 16:18.514
Was he alive at this point?

16:18.747 --> 16:19.588
Oh, yeah.

16:19.608 --> 16:20.870
He's out of the loop at this point.

16:20.890 --> 16:21.070
Oh, yeah.

16:21.091 --> 16:23.734
He was completely out of the loop at this point.

16:23.755 --> 16:30.044
So, at that point, I determined I'll just put my hand on the aorta.

16:30.124 --> 16:44.025
And I've done it a number of times over the years, you know, maybe three or four times in a situation where you get into a bleeding abdomen or an unexpected blood vessel cuts loose and you have to do this.

16:45.868 --> 16:46.088
But

16:46.574 --> 16:55.988
I've never been under such dramatic circumstances with a patient with no blood pressure coming into an operating room where I had no idea what the hell is going on.

16:56.008 --> 16:57.049
That was the amazement.

16:57.310 --> 17:08.025
But the other thing that, and I pointed out in the book, is when you have spent your life in certain parts of the body, you really feel they belong to you.

17:08.545 --> 17:10.668
and the belly just belongs to it.

17:10.708 --> 17:11.469
I love that line.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.293
I've got it flagged over using it as a story.

17:14.313 --> 17:28.372
And again, I don't mean to be stretching the comparison with pilots, but there really is this, I did an interview with Chuck Yeager once, and I said, what quality impresses you most in the pilot?

17:28.392 --> 17:30.896
He said, ours, ours in the cockpit.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.658
Experience is what he was saying.

17:33.299 --> 17:35.422
That's exactly what you're telling me right now.

17:35.562 --> 17:36.223
In other words,

17:36.625 --> 17:38.307
You know, who do you want next to you, a rookie?

17:38.628 --> 17:39.609
That's right.

17:39.649 --> 17:41.853
Somebody who knows exactly, you don't have to look.

17:42.273 --> 17:47.000
You know there's a lot of blood there, but you know exactly what you're going to feel when you're putting your hand down there.

17:47.020 --> 17:49.183
You've done this countless times.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.845
There's no mystery to you.

17:50.865 --> 17:53.469
And you know that real disasters are rare.

17:54.110 --> 18:05.907
And what an enormous steadying influence that is to know that you've been in trouble, you've seen your colleagues in trouble, and just about every time you get out of this.

18:06.528 --> 18:14.419
The moment you start feeling the tiniest bit of fear, that's the reassurance.

18:15.841 --> 18:24.994
You said it was important in this particular case, and then you said, in general, how you do mask the face, in a sense, the identity of the patient.

18:25.975 --> 18:29.600
And in this case, you really didn't even want to know that she had brothers.

18:30.321 --> 18:36.450
I'm not just meaning to stick with Mark, because the brother's story is just as dramatic, but I have to say, that opening one,

18:37.105 --> 18:40.630
You know, as Lyndon Johnson used to say, we've got to get them in the tent.

18:40.650 --> 18:41.971
And then you could preach to them.

18:42.051 --> 18:45.776
I never heard that expression.

18:45.816 --> 18:47.238
That's good.

18:47.278 --> 18:50.462
You certainly got us into the tent with that opening.

18:51.183 --> 18:52.805
It was gripping, really.

18:52.825 --> 18:54.347
It was a gripping, gripping story.

18:54.387 --> 19:01.737
And then your sense of pacing, I mean, from that one bang, right on to the next one and the next one after that.

19:02.758 --> 19:03.739
It's just the way I think.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.121
You know, it's...

19:05.303 --> 19:06.664
It's just the way my mind works.

19:06.885 --> 19:12.451
I can't stay with textbook stuff very long.

19:12.491 --> 19:17.656
I have to start putting it into the context of some living human being.

19:17.676 --> 19:20.619
Now, do you visualize a reader?

19:20.719 --> 19:28.107
Is this the supposed intelligent general reader that you're reaching for?

19:28.608 --> 19:29.449
The reader's me.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.673
The reader's always me without a medical education.

19:34.666 --> 19:39.233
I assume a reader is curious or he wouldn't have gotten this far.

19:39.253 --> 19:44.200
He wouldn't have bought the book in the first place or borrowed the book, and he wouldn't have reached this point.

19:44.420 --> 19:47.124
So I assume he's curious.

19:47.285 --> 19:49.788
The attrition process has brought them to this point.

19:49.828 --> 19:52.172
That's right, that they're still there with me.

19:52.492 --> 20:01.686
And if they're still there with me at this point, it's my obligation to make it interesting for them in the same way it's interesting for me.

20:02.324 --> 20:05.187
I've reached this point because I'm fascinated by it.

20:05.387 --> 20:07.990
I want them to be fascinated by it the same way I am.

20:08.310 --> 20:09.731
So I'm really the reader.

20:10.592 --> 20:15.998
You know, my style, someone once said, this guy's got a 19th century style.

20:16.138 --> 20:18.600
But, okay, that's the way I talk.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.681
That's the way I write.

20:20.222 --> 20:21.022
It's my voice.

20:21.263 --> 20:24.126
Nothing wrong with 19th century style.

20:24.146 --> 20:24.326
Yeah.

20:24.346 --> 20:29.331
In fact, just 19th century, I was just reading with my younger daughter.

20:30.552 --> 20:31.673
I was just working English.

20:31.957 --> 20:38.267
class years reading Light in August by Faulkner, you know, 60s, 70s, 60s, 70-year-old book.

20:39.008 --> 20:55.153
Amazing how beautifully written, not just Faulkner, but how much time and care they took with the phrasing, you know, 67 years ago, before we had all this infiltration of other media influences.

20:55.333 --> 20:55.854
Oh, yeah.

20:55.934 --> 20:59.179
A leisurely pace that he sets up that you can

21:00.509 --> 21:03.574
I don't know the relevance that has to anything we're talking about.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.057
No, I just had that experience.

21:05.538 --> 21:08.443
You know the work of Beryl Bainbridge, English writer?

21:08.563 --> 21:09.685
I know her work, yeah.

21:09.725 --> 21:14.354
She's got a new book out called Every Man for Himself about the Titanic.

21:14.835 --> 21:15.235
Oh, really?

21:15.356 --> 21:16.377
And I met her.

21:16.397 --> 21:25.133
I was just last week at this literary festival in Wales, and she and I did something together on stage, and so I decided I'd better read her book.

21:25.990 --> 21:53.297
she writes it in the style that books were written in at the time of the sinking of the titanic and at first it seems just a little strange and awkward and then when you realize what she's doing you fall into this thing you can't get out of it you just can't stop reading um you point out that this is not the first time this title has been used yes and that you are paying homage i guess to a degree to maybe a

21:54.442 --> 22:00.469
Well, most particularly to Walter B. Cannon, who of course worked at the Harvard Medical School.

22:01.410 --> 22:20.854
He, in 1932, I think it was, wrote this book called The Wisdom of the Body, in which he was exploring what's called the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that takes care of housekeeping functions, you know, the heart rate, how the intestine works, how the blood vessels clamp down, how the eye dilates.

22:21.762 --> 22:23.924
And it was really for popular consumption.

22:23.944 --> 22:31.432
It's a little tough going for popular consumption, but every medical student of the 40s, 50s, and 60s read that book.

22:31.532 --> 22:35.996
I don't want to make a pun, but it was a canon for us to read this book.

22:36.637 --> 22:51.752
In the introduction, he points out that he took the title from Ernest Starling, who's the man who discovered hormones, who at the beginning... And I got a hold of Starling's original speech in which he uses this title, The Wisdom of the Body, and it's got

22:52.053 --> 22:53.255
a little epigraph.

22:53.315 --> 23:00.745
In the epigraph, he doesn't say where it comes from, but I'm interested in the Bible, and I found that it's from Job.

23:01.066 --> 23:05.172
Yeah, I found that it doesn't say where it's from, but it's clearly from Job.

23:05.893 --> 23:08.877
And who hath given wisdom to the inner parts?

23:09.618 --> 23:10.960
It all comes from that.

23:11.160 --> 23:17.149
And the irony is, of course, to Job, the wisdom comes from God.

23:17.888 --> 23:29.568
to Walter B. Cannon and to Starling and then to Charles Sherrington, who used the title even later, the wisdom comes from the natural processes of natural selection.

23:30.169 --> 23:33.415
It's not by God.

23:33.555 --> 23:39.705
And so the natural tension in the book becomes, is this chemical driven, is this God driven?

23:40.006 --> 23:40.707
And if it's

23:41.345 --> 23:45.709
Chemical-driven, does that necessarily mean that God never had a hand in it?

23:45.729 --> 23:57.020
And as you know, as the book goes on, I deal with this, not very deeply, but just enough to point out that nothing I say here rules out the existence of God.

23:57.681 --> 24:02.686
So all of this is really in homage to these three great men.

24:05.388 --> 24:10.153
What is the response that you, the overwhelming response that you received,

24:10.505 --> 24:13.249
from how we value him.

24:13.269 --> 24:17.555
Was that influential at all?

24:17.575 --> 24:21.461
Only a writer could ask that question.

24:21.481 --> 24:29.153
Because you know, and I know, that when your work has been well received, you dare.

24:29.793 --> 24:30.775
You dare more.

24:31.356 --> 24:35.402
You know, you always try to find line when you write.

24:35.582 --> 24:38.867
You go beyond that line, and it's ludicrous or stiff.

24:38.967 --> 24:39.668
It doesn't work.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.541
A lot of writers don't dare get near that line.

24:44.202 --> 24:49.790
And because of the reception of How We Die, I said, people like the way I write.

24:49.850 --> 24:50.691
They understand it.

24:50.731 --> 24:51.572
They stay with it.

24:52.173 --> 24:53.876
I'm going to move the line even further.

24:53.936 --> 24:56.239
And that's what I did, essentially.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.163
You know, you take great risks in writing.

24:59.203 --> 25:00.305
You raise the bar a little bit.

25:00.325 --> 25:02.208
You raise the bar a little bit.

25:02.228 --> 25:02.628
Yeah.

25:02.728 --> 25:03.870
So I did that.

25:04.211 --> 25:07.155
And specifically raising the bar?

25:08.737 --> 25:09.418
Speculating.

25:09.753 --> 25:27.896
I feel now that people who have read my stuff, Doctors, then How We Die, are willing to accept the way I speculate and the way I conjecture about things.

25:28.156 --> 25:37.988
And so, in this book, I dared to speculate further by trying to speculate about the origins of the human spirit, the origins of culture.

25:38.407 --> 25:45.334
which I don't think I would have had the nerve to do had I not had this extraordinary reception to how we died.

25:45.955 --> 25:49.159
Well, again, you have to set a challenge for yourself, too.

25:49.179 --> 25:49.399
Sure.

25:49.639 --> 25:51.121
Why not give it a shot?

25:51.761 --> 26:04.355
And also, you know, the speculation grew so completely naturally out of studying molecular biology and then organ biology that I thought, my God, this makes sense to me.

26:04.435 --> 26:05.516
Why not write about it?

26:06.677 --> 26:07.198
So I did.

26:08.090 --> 26:15.178
Tell me about constructing the book, too, because it does have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

26:15.258 --> 26:18.101
It's not just going from one part of the body to the other.

26:18.641 --> 26:23.246
You do see it, I think, as one exquisite whole, I guess.

26:23.547 --> 26:28.572
Well, I'm going to say something that's going to surprise you.

26:31.315 --> 26:35.059
I never construct anything I write.

26:35.444 --> 26:37.666
I have no outline for anything.

26:37.686 --> 26:38.827
Neither do I, by the way.

26:38.847 --> 26:39.208
Really?

26:39.228 --> 26:40.369
Yeah.

26:40.389 --> 26:40.589
I don't.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.810
It works, doesn't it?

26:41.830 --> 26:42.111
It does.

26:42.291 --> 26:42.631
It's here.

26:42.651 --> 26:43.392
It really works.

26:43.612 --> 26:44.032
It's here.

26:44.132 --> 26:45.734
It's in there all the time.

26:45.754 --> 26:47.175
It does come out whole, though.

26:47.195 --> 26:48.176
It comes out whole.

26:48.997 --> 26:50.058
That's amazing.

26:50.078 --> 26:53.342
You see, you're the only other person I've ever heard say that.

26:54.242 --> 27:01.630
I trust my subconscious mind, and it's whenever I run into someone who's intelligent who says, I want to write a book, I encourage them.

27:02.310 --> 27:05.113
Because I think we've got a lot more in our head

27:05.482 --> 27:13.875
than we ever dream about consciously, and it's only when we write it that it comes out, and I don't think these are scattered thoughts.

27:14.817 --> 27:18.362
I think that these are organized ways of looking at things.

27:18.383 --> 27:21.968
I get up every morning, I start writing about 8.15.

27:22.910 --> 27:25.554
I will often read what I wrote the day before.

27:25.634 --> 27:28.959
Sometimes I don't, but I never read beyond that.

27:28.979 --> 27:29.380
I just

27:30.035 --> 27:31.276
pick up where I quit.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.257
And I'll quit anywhere.

27:32.377 --> 27:34.540
I'll quit because I'm tired.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.923
I'll quit because there's a tennis game that I want to play.

27:38.684 --> 27:41.287
I'll quit because I've got a class to teach.

27:41.307 --> 27:43.269
So I'll quit at the end of a sentence.

27:43.289 --> 27:49.576
And I'll pick up the next day, and sentence by sentence, I don't know what I'm going to do.

27:49.756 --> 27:53.780
Do you write from beginning to end, or do you kind of jump around?

27:53.800 --> 27:57.544
I just started my new book, and I basically started writing what I

27:57.727 --> 28:01.030
guess will be the final chapter, because this feels right.

28:01.050 --> 28:01.931
Because it feels right.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.012
It absolutely feels right.

28:03.032 --> 28:08.437
I feel I know this, and I know precisely where I'm entering it and where it's going.

28:08.617 --> 28:12.641
It's almost frighteningly easy.

28:12.661 --> 28:13.702
It's going to be a great book.

28:13.762 --> 28:19.447
But then, of course, it leads now to this other area that's going to come before it.

28:19.688 --> 28:23.091
I did a piece on Otto Bettman.

28:23.111 --> 28:24.452
Remember the Bettman Archive?

28:24.532 --> 28:26.434
Bill Gates bought his archive.

28:27.022 --> 28:33.952
When that was announced in the New York Times, there was one little paragraph that this man is alive and well and living in Florida.

28:34.132 --> 28:34.993
Batman's alive?

28:35.193 --> 28:36.595
Not only alive, but lucid.

28:37.737 --> 28:39.319
He must be 100 years old.

28:39.339 --> 28:39.800
He's 96.

28:41.242 --> 28:43.225
My wife and I were on an airplane within a week.

28:43.245 --> 28:44.166
We spent two days with him.

28:44.206 --> 28:46.610
Because he is so perfect.

28:47.130 --> 28:50.295
He has touched every decade of the 20th century.

28:50.896 --> 28:56.944
I would have a chapter on the Jewish emigrate booksellers who fled Hitler and came here and how they

28:57.160 --> 29:01.184
They brought with him the whole European attitude of Rosenbach scholarship.

29:01.364 --> 29:01.965
Rosenbach, yeah.

29:02.045 --> 29:04.447
Rosenbach was born here, but Krauss was born here.

29:04.467 --> 29:05.388
Rosenbach was born here.

29:05.428 --> 29:14.277
Rosenbach was a Philly guy, yeah, but he's married way before Hitler, actually, Rosenbach.

29:14.297 --> 29:14.738
Right, right, right.

29:14.758 --> 29:22.666
But anyway, Otto was a rare books librarian in Leipzig, and then, of course, he saw this idea of the image of the picture.

29:22.806 --> 29:26.610
He basically, you know, Life Magazine, he was their first supplier.

29:27.097 --> 29:31.901
came with a dozen pictures, but he's also a world authority on Bach.

29:32.061 --> 29:36.485
And while we were there, he played for my wife and I, a little piece on his organ.

29:37.346 --> 29:39.929
And I said to him, why Bach?

29:40.009 --> 29:43.272
This is in the prologue to my book.

29:43.292 --> 29:45.013
And he said, because, why Bach?

29:45.053 --> 29:46.234
He said, good question.

29:46.254 --> 29:50.618
He said, because Bach always returns to where he started.

29:50.638 --> 29:52.700
And it says it much more eloquently than that.

29:53.461 --> 29:56.023
But, you know, it's the capo or whatever it is, but

29:56.408 --> 29:57.670
I always like to come back.

29:57.690 --> 30:01.976
I have two chapters in the new book, Continuum I and Continuum II.

30:01.996 --> 30:10.187
I always wanted, for me, the unity is to, I don't care where you're going, to try and come back to that same place that you started at.

30:11.369 --> 30:12.290
It's a symmetry.

30:12.490 --> 30:16.676
It's a symmetry that is the way our minds work.

30:17.217 --> 30:20.261
You know, I should tell you about a guy you probably know very well.

30:20.341 --> 30:22.905
Unfortunately, he's been dead about ten years, but

30:23.712 --> 30:26.355
His books are here in Boston now, Vern Dibner.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.497
You know the Dibner collection?

30:27.977 --> 30:30.580
Oh, I'm going to write that one down.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.463
Let me tell you a little bit about Dibner.

30:33.524 --> 30:36.327
The Dibner archive, I think, is now owned by Brandeis.

30:38.290 --> 30:51.205
Dibner was an Eastern European Jewish immigrant who came here when he was in his early teens, I believe.

30:51.590 --> 30:53.453
This is an excuseable right without a pen.

30:53.473 --> 30:54.093
Here it is.

30:54.394 --> 30:54.614
Okay.

30:55.335 --> 30:56.437
B-E-R-N.

30:59.841 --> 31:00.923
B-E-R-N.

31:01.864 --> 31:03.666
D-I-B-N-E-R.

31:04.848 --> 31:13.840
He came here before World War I as an immigrant with five or six brothers, and he went initially to Cooper Union.

31:14.601 --> 31:19.808
It gets even better than that because there was a school on the Lower East Side set up by a

31:20.193 --> 31:26.740
Protestant clergyman for Jewish boys, and he brought these kids into the American mainstream.

31:27.501 --> 31:33.788
So Byrne Dibner goes to this school, gets into Cooper Union, and he flunks out.

31:34.408 --> 31:45.340
So he goes to some school, which later grows up to be New York Tech, to which, incidentally, he's given millions of dollars, and learns about electrical engineering, and he invents in the 20s

31:45.725 --> 32:01.980
Well, first he goes in the Navy in World War I, serves, I don't know what he served on, but he's a seaman, a basic seaman in World War I. Comes back, invents this electrical connection of the 20s, electrical connector that was bought by the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.303
And by the time he's in his early 30s, he's a multimillionaire.

32:05.483 --> 32:07.464
And it's, you know, it's 1931, 32.

32:07.645 --> 32:09.807
He's got a partner.

32:10.207 --> 32:13.690
So he moves his business out of the Bronx up to Connecticut and says,

32:14.193 --> 32:15.514
I've now got a lot of money.

32:15.634 --> 32:21.519
I want to buy books in the history of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and science.

32:22.360 --> 32:26.163
And he amasses... Oh, World War II comes.

32:26.723 --> 32:28.305
He's 42 years old.

32:28.545 --> 32:33.109
He enlists a buck private in the Air Force because he loves this country.

32:34.290 --> 32:43.337
He serves the whole war, finds himself in 45 in Germany with all the money he needs, and he just starts buying like crazy.

32:43.538 --> 32:44.098
He's very...

32:44.534 --> 32:47.979
This is the kind of person I want in this chapter.

32:47.999 --> 32:51.143
Oh, it's the perfect person.

32:52.044 --> 33:04.200
So he comes back to the States, and in the 60s, maybe in the 70s, he builds a huge and beautiful library in Norwalk, Connecticut, because that's where one of his plants is.

33:04.300 --> 33:05.602
I've heard of this guy.

33:05.622 --> 33:11.470
Yeah, it's the Burndy Corporation, named after him, U-R-N-D-Y Corporation.

33:11.703 --> 33:13.626
U-R-N-D-Y.

33:13.686 --> 33:15.488
That's his corporation.

33:15.508 --> 33:20.875
All founded on one electrical connector that he invented when he was in his 20s.

33:20.895 --> 33:24.400
Is there some literature on them?

33:24.420 --> 33:37.558
I have literature on them at home, and if you contact the library at Brandeis... And his son, David, is still alive, and David can tell you all about him.

33:37.893 --> 33:39.995
He gets an honorary degree from Brandeis.

33:40.035 --> 33:41.597
He gets other honorary degrees.

33:42.938 --> 33:47.823
So here's this guy who loves this country so much that he's enlisted as a private lawyer.

33:47.903 --> 33:49.304
He ends up a lieutenant colonel.

33:50.886 --> 33:52.867
He comes back and builds this library.

33:52.887 --> 33:56.351
The business is now an international business, and he's giving money away.

33:56.411 --> 34:04.879
He ends up giving, I think it was half of his library, to the Smithsonian, where it's housed, I think in a special collection.

34:06.395 --> 34:08.357
Smithsonian or the Library of Congress?

34:08.377 --> 34:08.918
Smithsonian.

34:10.259 --> 34:13.722
Because he had also a collection of instruments.

34:13.883 --> 34:15.704
He's got Pasteur's microscope.

34:16.525 --> 34:18.047
When you go into his... He sounds good for me.

34:18.487 --> 34:19.608
He's perfect for you.

34:19.628 --> 34:20.509
He's made for you.

34:20.529 --> 34:21.410
Because, yeah, he is.

34:22.531 --> 34:23.993
And he's right here in Boston.

34:24.013 --> 34:27.396
I mean, he's dead, but he's... But, I mean, on ways you can't even imagine.

34:27.516 --> 34:27.917
Yeah.

34:28.698 --> 34:34.123
Again, it's sort of a migration of books and ideas from a war-torn

34:35.099 --> 34:40.045
When you start writing about him, give me a call, because I had a lot of dealings with him.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.428
203-776-5635.

34:42.628 --> 34:48.014
Let me give you a card.

34:48.034 --> 34:51.758
I think you'd like to see the story.

34:52.319 --> 34:56.324
You bet.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.888
I'm going to Paris in three weeks for this new book.

35:00.048 --> 35:01.630
Oh, I'll work.

35:02.302 --> 35:05.005
the major international component of this new book.

35:05.746 --> 35:05.826
Oh.

35:05.846 --> 35:09.270
Well, I'm going to do a tour, a pilgrimage.

35:09.290 --> 35:17.359
It's going to be a travel piece of libraries through history, but how significant they've been.

35:17.379 --> 35:19.381
You know, it's not just going to libraries.

35:19.902 --> 35:23.285
It's going to Monte Cassino, where the Rule of Benedict was won.

35:23.306 --> 35:24.907
It's going to St.

35:24.927 --> 35:27.330
Galway, which was the great monastic scriptorium.

35:27.833 --> 35:30.496
Going to Pergamon, which is still the shell of the library.

35:30.516 --> 35:32.799
It's still there, so then you can talk about Alexandria.

35:33.199 --> 35:40.247
Going to Seville, which was established by Columbus's son, a library that's the great Columbus Library in Seville.

35:40.267 --> 35:42.650
It's been in continuous existence for 500 years.

35:44.052 --> 35:44.612
I've never heard of it.

35:44.632 --> 35:48.276
Not many people have, and it has all of the apples, diaries, logs.

35:48.296 --> 35:54.043
When you think of the American experience, the European experience, it's totally bracketed by print.

35:54.817 --> 35:59.083
When Columbus got back, he announced his discovery in a letter, which was published.

35:59.243 --> 36:00.585
It's called The Columbus Letter.

36:00.605 --> 36:00.845
Uh-huh.

36:00.865 --> 36:05.771
You can write about these things by going to the, you know, if you want to go forward and forward and forward.

36:05.791 --> 36:06.292
Wow.

36:06.312 --> 36:08.915
And then I'm going to go to the immediate present and the future.

36:08.955 --> 36:10.798
I've already been to the brand-new British Library.

36:10.818 --> 36:14.783
I've had a brand-new bibliotech desk, and I'll go into the brand-new German Library.

36:15.134 --> 36:19.340
That's $4 billion worth of libraries that have all opened within six months of each other.

36:19.360 --> 36:23.726
What about the one in Moscow, the big national library in Moscow?

36:24.046 --> 36:33.219
I'm going to have an Eastern European chapter, Sarajevo, starting with a description of books, because for the future, we can go into wonderful directions.

36:33.279 --> 36:36.383
One night in 1994, 1992 was it?

36:37.308 --> 36:42.513
1.2 million books destroyed deliberately as part of the ethnic cleansing thing.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.576
If you're going to kill a people, you have to kill their memory, kill their history.

36:46.237 --> 36:47.898
And so now there's an international effort.

36:48.859 --> 36:51.081
It's only had five paragraphs in the New York Times.

36:51.101 --> 36:52.282
Well, yeah, why do we know that?

36:52.523 --> 36:57.267
Well, we don't, because it's not, I mean, people, of course, are extremely important.

36:57.648 --> 37:06.336
But books, they figure, I've already interviewed the librarian who was out there that morning when precious manuscripts were falling out of the sky.

37:07.345 --> 37:17.479
And he said, it's something, when you hold a manuscript in your hands, and the letters, they turn black before they disappear in your hands.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.122
And this was targeted in this story.

37:19.142 --> 37:23.268
You know, if you're going to destroy a people, I mean, this is not unique.

37:23.288 --> 37:25.851
This has happened many, many times.

37:25.871 --> 37:31.159
So we've got to write about Eastern European book culture, post-Soviet period.

37:31.831 --> 37:33.213
books of the future.

37:33.233 --> 37:39.782
I've been over to MIT where they have what they call the future book, the digital revolution.

37:39.862 --> 37:42.626
What's happening to books in universities?

37:42.646 --> 37:47.072
A lot of places are very quietly getting rid of their books and sending them to landfills.

37:47.293 --> 37:48.234
Don't I know?

37:48.474 --> 37:49.215
Don't I know?

37:49.315 --> 37:51.839
A very prestigious Ivy League institution.

37:52.400 --> 37:57.687
I go from Harvard, which I opened this chapter I was just telling you about, and they have this

37:59.185 --> 38:01.607
They have the Southboro campus of Harvard.

38:01.627 --> 38:09.115
No Harvard graduate has ever heard knows that Harvard has a campus out in Southboro, Massachusetts, but it's where they bury the books.

38:09.135 --> 38:10.136
They have these modules.

38:10.236 --> 38:11.817
They're saving their books.

38:11.837 --> 38:14.440
There's no such thing as a dead book at Harvard.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.922
So they have 14 million books, and they're going to keep them.

38:16.942 --> 38:17.843
They're going to save them.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.005
It's all computers and everything out there.

38:20.025 --> 38:21.567
They have 14 million.

38:22.128 --> 38:23.249
They have 13.8.

38:23.329 --> 38:24.670
They'll pass 14.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.105
We've only got six.

38:27.367 --> 38:31.433
Cornell has six, eight, and they're going down to six by the year 2000.

38:31.453 --> 38:32.915
Wow, wow.

38:33.877 --> 38:38.764
When you're ready to do that big library in Moscow, give me a call.

38:38.824 --> 38:46.757
My daughter is Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Russia, and she knows all these things and knows how to get to things.

38:47.097 --> 38:47.318
Really?

38:47.438 --> 38:48.239
Yeah.

38:48.319 --> 38:48.940
So give me a call.

38:49.180 --> 38:50.763
I need help in Eastern Europe.

38:50.783 --> 38:51.364
Sure you do.

38:51.564 --> 38:52.125
Sure you do.

38:52.308 --> 38:59.698
Edward Kasaneck at the New York Public Library, who's head of the Ukrainian department here, is helping me.

38:59.818 --> 39:01.220
But I might have a good bite.

39:01.400 --> 39:05.186
You never know if you can confuse a little State Department enforcement.

39:05.386 --> 39:05.827
Oh, yeah.

39:05.867 --> 39:10.533
You see, you'll want to deal with the cultural attaché in Moscow.

39:10.593 --> 39:13.197
I don't know who that is right now, who it'll be when you're there.

39:13.938 --> 39:17.843
But those are the people who, you know, in any country,

39:19.122 --> 39:23.846
that you're working in, it helps to just be in touch with a cultural attache.

39:24.306 --> 39:31.332
Every, as you know, in every embassy there's a person whose job it is to handle anything that has to do with the culture of that country.

39:31.352 --> 39:34.455
Some of them are totally inept, but some of them are really very good.

39:35.116 --> 39:36.637
Especially Eastern European.

39:37.117 --> 39:41.901
I know I'm very comfortable in England and in France and Italy and places like that.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.563
It's going to be a fun book.

39:43.643 --> 39:44.684
See, this is not a great book.

39:44.704 --> 39:47.286
Collecting it all, but it's book culture.

39:47.306 --> 39:48.387
The subtitle is Book

39:48.704 --> 39:51.628
book places and book culture.

39:51.648 --> 39:52.289
I mean, he was a new millennium.

39:52.529 --> 39:56.175
You may want, you know, his name, Alexander Schenker, mean anything to you?

39:56.515 --> 40:02.544
He's the... I don't know, Israel is Schenker, but... No, Alexander, S-C-H-E-N-K-E-R.

40:02.704 --> 40:07.170
He's the big professor of Slavic studies at Yale.

40:10.015 --> 40:11.437
I'd love to do it.

40:11.457 --> 40:13.159
I just did this fellow up in Toronto.

40:13.898 --> 40:16.422
Dr. Simmons at Oxford.

40:17.704 --> 40:19.848
He's just retired from All Souls College.

40:19.868 --> 40:23.414
He's a major person in Ukraine.

40:23.434 --> 40:26.800
He's Dr. Alexander Schencher at Yale.

40:26.860 --> 40:27.521
He's a man.

40:27.561 --> 40:30.867
Well, Alex is about 70 now, but he looks like he's about 40.

40:31.328 --> 40:35.214
He's just marvelous.

40:35.274 --> 40:36.697
What am I talking about?

40:36.757 --> 40:37.358
Not at all.

40:37.591 --> 40:38.172
Not at all.

40:38.352 --> 40:49.124
And when it comes to religious books, which you're going to definitely want to be interested in, Eastern European religious books, the guy to talk to, and you know this name, is Yaroslav Pelikan.

40:49.264 --> 40:50.205
Oh, that's famous, yeah.

40:50.225 --> 40:52.087
Yeah, and he's at Yale, too.

40:55.130 --> 40:59.215
You know, Tony Grafton at Princeton is marvelous.

40:59.235 --> 41:02.298
A writer to be a part-time Gregorian who's coming back to New York.

41:02.318 --> 41:02.839
He's wonderful.

41:03.072 --> 41:12.005
Paul Leclerc is being very helpful to me because he loved my book.

41:12.025 --> 41:14.128
Of course.

41:14.428 --> 41:21.679
The fellow who's setting me up at the Bibliothèque Nationale, his name is Thierry Brier.

41:22.460 --> 41:24.142
He's the head of the library.

41:24.443 --> 41:26.265
Paul says, use my name.

41:26.286 --> 41:26.926
I use his name.

41:26.946 --> 41:27.828
The guy calls me.

41:28.469 --> 41:31.493
He's totally setting up my whole itinerary environment.

41:32.097 --> 41:33.319
I said, I can't think of it.

41:33.880 --> 41:36.103
He said, we know Mr. Nick Clayton.

41:36.143 --> 41:37.004
He said, very well.

41:37.024 --> 41:37.725
We respect him.

41:38.586 --> 41:39.668
He recommends you.

41:39.728 --> 41:41.330
He said, we'll do everything we can to help you.

41:41.350 --> 41:47.459
You know that the director of the Congress Library of Commerce, Billington, has been interviewed already.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.741
Yeah, OK.

41:49.302 --> 41:50.864
He's already been interviewed.

41:50.984 --> 41:54.950
No, I've done about 100 interviews already for the new book.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.172
I wanted it to be swell.

41:56.252 --> 41:59.497
I noticed, for instance, your new book is bigger than the other one, by the way.

41:59.537 --> 42:01.800
Yeah, well, they didn't want it to be that big, but I just

42:02.337 --> 42:03.859
So tell me about the work in progress.

42:04.180 --> 42:06.483
Because the book certainly speaks for itself.

42:06.503 --> 42:09.948
I don't want to question about things.

42:10.028 --> 42:16.217
This is just between you and me, because I don't think Glenn would be happy if it got into the public domain.

42:16.998 --> 42:27.894
Once again, it's Glenn's idea, but it fits in exactly and precisely with what one can only call the body of one's work.

42:29.136 --> 42:32.260
You remember in As You Like It, The Seven Ages of Man?

42:32.662 --> 42:47.837
Yeah, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the sequential developmental stages and talk about development psychology, biological changes, worldview changes, all of those things that occur as we progress.

42:48.778 --> 42:54.244
And the subject matter, the anecdotal matter, is going to be me.

42:55.325 --> 42:57.387
It's essentially going to be...

42:58.227 --> 43:03.432
I write about my grandmother, for example, what my family was like.

43:03.452 --> 43:08.618
I'm going to focus on family members and people I have known to explore.

43:08.658 --> 43:09.319
I won't write.

43:09.999 --> 43:14.884
Let me just say, well, don't worry about the machine being on it.

43:14.904 --> 43:16.266
Oh, I understand that.

43:16.286 --> 43:18.748
I wouldn't say this to anybody else, but I can say it to you.

43:18.768 --> 43:25.956
Well, we can say that there's a work in progress that will continue your exploration and considerations of the human condition, essentially.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.374
You know, based on how many years now?

43:28.714 --> 43:31.919
Sixty-six and a half as a human being.

43:32.780 --> 43:38.327
A physician since 1955, so it's, you know, 42 years.

43:38.347 --> 43:40.390
You know, one, you don't use the word that I could see.

43:40.450 --> 43:41.251
Maybe you used that.

43:41.271 --> 43:42.212
I was reading too quickly.

43:42.252 --> 43:46.979
You don't use the word synergy, but you do suggest that we are greater than the sum of all our parts.

43:47.139 --> 43:48.080
Oh, absolutely.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.041
Which is synergy.

43:49.081 --> 43:49.943
Yeah, absolutely.

43:50.223 --> 43:52.947
And maybe you could just give me a comment on that.

43:52.967 --> 43:53.728
Yeah, yeah.

43:53.908 --> 43:54.829
Well, you know...

43:55.045 --> 44:07.099
The only reason that biological organisms stay alive, their only function, as any good biologist will tell you, is to stay alive, to preserve the DNA to the next generation.

44:07.159 --> 44:15.428
So given biologically what we have, it has been provided by natural selection just to keep us safe from the environment.

44:15.448 --> 44:19.433
But we have created, with that, we've created culture.

44:19.533 --> 44:22.116
We've created music and poetry, and we've created

44:22.417 --> 44:27.404
Out of sex, we've created sexuality and all the good and bad things that go with that.

44:28.025 --> 44:35.696
We have created our ways of dealing with each other, our ways of childbearing, and it didn't have to happen that way.

44:35.796 --> 44:44.709
The only thing that had to happen was we had to keep the next generation alive just long enough to reproduce, but we've done much, much, much greater than that.

44:44.729 --> 44:50.618
So if an entire civilization can do that, if an entire species can do that, homo sapiens,

44:51.695 --> 45:01.786
It's because each individual in that species can do much beyond what his simple biological needs are.

45:01.806 --> 45:18.044
So each of us, because of the free will that we have developed, can add to the culture, add to the notion of individual love for people, of the association within families and society.

45:18.104 --> 45:21.668
So we become greater than the sum of our biological

45:22.036 --> 45:24.919
There's a richness in our lives.

45:25.520 --> 45:40.217
Freud pointed out, I can't remember exactly where, oh, in Civilization of Discontents, pointed out that beauty, the notion of beauty, has no biological function whatsoever.

45:40.257 --> 45:42.220
It is something we have found.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.441
We've found it.

45:43.501 --> 45:44.543
We have created it.

45:44.903 --> 45:45.744
It's an extra.

45:46.225 --> 45:48.347
Whether it's a violin sonata,

45:48.783 --> 46:01.677
or whether it's a poem or a graphic art or the beauty we see in the faces of our children, we interpret things in ways that elevate us, that make us much more in simple biology.

46:02.318 --> 46:07.484
And the flip side of that, things we find offensive, I would think is the same.

46:07.864 --> 46:13.350
When I think of even smells of things, I mean, smells we find offensive makes smells we find pleasing.

46:13.430 --> 46:15.853
Is this just something that we've created for ourselves?

46:16.036 --> 46:22.283
Well, some are biological because they produce an aversion and we stay away.

46:22.323 --> 46:25.728
If some things smell bad, they're dangerous to us.

46:26.589 --> 46:30.693
You're not going to eat a putrefied piece of meat because it smells bad.

46:30.794 --> 46:32.295
So this is part of the training.

46:32.315 --> 46:32.435
Right.

46:32.456 --> 46:38.963
But at the same... No, well, it's actually physically offensive to us, even if you had no training.

46:39.063 --> 46:42.988
If you were a feral child, you were out in the wilderness, you would stay away from

46:43.390 --> 46:46.254
putrefied meat because it just has an awful odor.

46:46.314 --> 46:47.596
It makes you sick.

46:47.616 --> 46:49.599
Yeah, but others know that.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.985
And you know that inherently, instinctively.

46:53.065 --> 47:01.538
But other smells, we learn as time goes on, are offensive because of experiences we have had with them.

47:01.558 --> 47:08.007
And individual people can't stand certain odors, whereas another guy might say, gee, that's wonderful.

47:08.027 --> 47:09.490
Because there are cultural differences.

47:09.690 --> 47:11.853
I mean, the people eat and they think are wonderful.

47:12.114 --> 47:12.334
Yeah.

47:12.736 --> 47:24.007
So some are instinctive for a whole species, and some are learned as a result of either cultural or individual experience.

47:24.187 --> 47:38.862
And I know how deeply concerned you are with matters of ethics and medical ethics, you know, the continuing question, of course, and it's on the front page of the New York Times again today, developing, you know, here's today's Times.

47:41.474 --> 47:53.071
Considering the unthinkable protocol for assisted suicide, you know, page one of today's New York Times, and then we see stories about calling human beings, whether or not it should be outlawed, the president is now thinking.

47:53.631 --> 47:57.397
I mean, there are just two, I guess these are medical issues, aren't they?

47:57.497 --> 47:58.819
Oh, yes, they're medical issues.

47:58.899 --> 48:01.803
Maybe you could give me a brief.

48:01.823 --> 48:06.790
Well, it's impossible to be brief because, you know, whenever...

48:07.462 --> 48:13.789
I've been thinking a lot about this and talking to colleagues about it because there's something I'm trying to get to the bottom of.

48:13.809 --> 48:26.824
It seems to me that whenever a society has to make rules about something, it means that the ability of the individual to cope with those problems has fallen apart.

48:27.144 --> 48:30.608
So society has to make rules overall.

48:30.628 --> 48:36.034
It's my notion that individual morality has eroded

48:36.757 --> 48:39.061
in the second half of the 20th century.

48:40.925 --> 48:51.025
We knew until about the middle 60s, everybody understood that the morality of Western society was essentially Christian morality.

48:51.405 --> 48:53.089
You may want to call it Judeo-Christian.

48:53.109 --> 48:53.870
It's the same thing.

48:53.950 --> 48:55.654
It was Christian morality.

48:55.674 --> 48:58.900
We knew what you did if you were a good person.

49:00.061 --> 49:14.604
With the rising up of this sort of self-determination movement that started with the kids in the late 60s, they developed in our society what you can only call a moral relativism, and that's the term people use.

49:14.944 --> 49:19.652
Your idea of what's good is as good as, or my idea is as good as yours.

49:21.014 --> 49:26.622
Along with that went a breakdown in our notion of authority figures.

49:27.223 --> 49:28.245
Everybody got

49:29.103 --> 49:36.793
got the idea that there's an egalitarianism in our society, so that there's no real morality.

49:36.813 --> 49:38.355
Morality is relative.

49:39.417 --> 49:56.680
And the result of it has been the enormous rise, I think, in things like pornography on our TV screens at night, in laxity about the family, in laxity about raising our children,

49:57.503 --> 50:04.511
in a general air of permissiveness that I think is killing the structure of society.

50:05.753 --> 50:08.135
It has also invaded science.

50:08.996 --> 50:13.381
It has also invaded relationships of doctors with patients.

50:14.162 --> 50:24.454
But most importantly, it's eroded the individual scientist or clinician's notion of what's right and wrong to do with his work.

50:25.415 --> 50:26.076
And so,

50:26.258 --> 50:32.826
We now need rules because we can't depend on individuals anymore.

50:32.846 --> 50:37.331
I think there is much more cheating in science, not just because it's being uncovered more.

50:37.451 --> 50:42.938
I really believe there's much more cheating in science than ever existed until the last 20 years.

50:43.278 --> 50:50.147
There are a lot of reasons for it, obviously different kinds of pressures, but part of it has to do with this moral relativism.

50:50.167 --> 50:52.249
There are no longer absolute

50:52.820 --> 50:54.342
criteria of morality.

50:54.562 --> 50:59.547
So the society has to step in and make laws, and that's what ethics are.

50:59.847 --> 51:06.554
Ethics are a negotiated system of principles that everybody agrees are the right thing to do.

51:06.594 --> 51:20.929
So I think that's why the whole idea of the profession of medical ethics has arisen, that society is weak, morality in society is weak, and we have to create this.

51:21.529 --> 51:22.050
Of course,

51:22.469 --> 51:25.433
The whole field of medical ethics is new.

51:25.553 --> 51:30.479
Some are philosophers, some are clinicians, some are lawyers, some are ministers.

51:31.140 --> 51:32.962
They're trying to learn from each other.

51:33.022 --> 51:40.812
Some of the stuff you read in the medical ethics literature is absolutely laughable because of ignorance of what really happens.

51:41.253 --> 51:43.876
Some of it is very good and very important.

51:44.417 --> 51:52.307
So we're in this terrible state of flux, and what complicates the issue is

51:52.709 --> 52:10.034
that in the last five years or so with molecular biology, we have reached a point where the implications of the science are so enormous for our society that we can no longer leave it to the scientists to decide what they should research.

52:10.195 --> 52:11.036
And for the species.

52:11.577 --> 52:12.177
That's right.

52:12.738 --> 52:13.219
That's right.

52:13.239 --> 52:17.425
If you can make a human being in about 200 years, somebody's going to do that.

52:17.445 --> 52:19.408
For the whole species, that's right.

52:20.047 --> 52:30.338
So because there is so much cultural involvement in the outcomes of science, the whole society has to have a say in what's done.

52:30.839 --> 52:46.155
And it's interesting to me that that committee of the Institute of Medicine, whose report came out a couple of days ago, No More Human Cloning, as far as I know, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, I could easily be wrong, this is the first time

52:46.793 --> 52:53.808
government or society has ever overtly said you can't do certain kinds of research.

52:53.868 --> 53:02.085
Now, granted, the research of fetal parts for Parkinsonism was stopped or slowed down.

53:02.506 --> 53:07.857
The government stopped funding research on the artificial heart, but

53:08.090 --> 53:09.732
Well, it was a failure, too.

53:09.832 --> 53:11.354
Well, it was a failure, yeah.

53:11.394 --> 53:14.557
They were just jumping way ahead of what they had the technology for.

53:14.577 --> 53:18.962
They did that with heart transplantation originally, too, and they should have stopped that for a while.

53:19.843 --> 53:23.467
But this is an enormous step the government has taken.

53:23.487 --> 53:30.394
They've appointed this committee of very wise and able people who have said, you've got to stop.

53:30.675 --> 53:30.975
This is

53:31.647 --> 53:32.968
Step back.

53:33.629 --> 53:35.270
Step back and let's look at this.

53:35.350 --> 53:37.652
And I'm very pleased about that.

53:37.772 --> 53:40.194
I'm enormously pleased about it.

53:40.214 --> 53:50.343
You know, if somebody within the argument could be, well, what if you talk about this being an exquisite, the body being an exquisite thing, but has its flaws.

53:50.363 --> 53:50.483
Yeah.

53:50.543 --> 54:00.372
So what if they say, well, look, we can clone out these, not clone out, we can, by tampering and tinkering with DNA, we can get rid of them.

54:00.588 --> 54:05.392
the flaws that cause people to have heart attacks, but we can slow down the aging process.

54:05.412 --> 54:07.434
It's the worst thing that could happen.

54:07.454 --> 54:08.135
I mean, it is.

54:08.555 --> 54:12.939
Would you agree that it is necessary for there to be a renewal of generations?

54:13.300 --> 54:14.421
I wrote that and how we did it.

54:14.441 --> 54:15.301
That's exactly what you did.

54:15.522 --> 54:15.882
That's right.

54:15.902 --> 54:18.905
We had this discussion that, you know, we come around.

54:18.925 --> 54:19.565
It's like spring.

54:19.585 --> 54:20.846
Every spring, it's a whole crop.

54:20.946 --> 54:21.567
Absolutely.

54:22.408 --> 54:27.673
You know, what happens in the next generation should not be decided by an old guy like me.

54:27.713 --> 54:30.375
It should be decided by someone in his 20s or 30s.

54:30.490 --> 54:31.211
Yeah.

54:31.231 --> 54:32.634
You need new perspective.

54:32.775 --> 54:33.576
I was so pleased.

54:33.596 --> 54:38.085
I'm going to a conference at the American Antiquarian Society, which happens to be in Worcester.

54:38.105 --> 54:40.290
It's nationally renowned.

54:40.310 --> 54:47.564
And there's a conference going on there in the history of the book, where we can tell about society and certain private objects in books.

54:48.366 --> 54:49.889
But it's wonderful.

54:50.650 --> 54:52.414
But I was so pleased to see

54:53.238 --> 54:54.900
I was by far 54.

54:54.920 --> 54:57.584
I was the old, clearly the oldest person in the room.

54:57.624 --> 54:58.084
So young people.

54:58.104 --> 54:58.665
I liked it.

54:58.885 --> 54:59.927
I liked it.

54:59.967 --> 55:02.690
The people who were running the seminar were in their forties.

55:03.291 --> 55:09.860
These were young graduate students and librarians interested in books and artifacts, and to me it was wonderful.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.605
I don't want a bunch of old farts like myself making this.

55:13.625 --> 55:14.646
Well, I feel the same way.

55:14.946 --> 55:16.208
You know, there's one thing.

55:16.677 --> 55:19.860
We're old on the one hand, but very happy on the other.

55:19.880 --> 55:23.363
Well, there's one thing that's called wisdom, and something else called creativity.

55:23.643 --> 55:25.765
You know, the wisdom comes to us.

55:25.865 --> 55:28.347
It has to do with experience, hours in the cockpit.

55:28.367 --> 55:30.129
It has to do with a lot of things.

55:30.189 --> 55:35.734
When it comes to creativity, that is largely the province of beyond.

55:35.754 --> 55:39.958
A classic example is who wins Nobel Prizes in the sciences?

55:39.978 --> 55:45.823
There are all these guys under 40, or at least their work was done when they were under 40.

55:46.327 --> 55:58.858
The only person who has ever written a book like The Wisdom of the Body is a fellow named Logan Clendenning, who in 1927 wrote a book for Knopf, interestingly, called The Human Body.

55:58.898 --> 56:01.200
He tried to do what I tried to do.

56:02.261 --> 56:06.165
He was a skeptic, a religious skeptic, didn't believe there was a god.

56:06.765 --> 56:15.793
And he writes at the end of the book, he's writing about death, and he says that, you know, life had to occur, given the chemicals and the electricity in the air, you know, lightning,

56:16.145 --> 56:18.367
water, that light had to occur.

56:18.387 --> 56:32.760
He said, but to conceive of death, he said, that is the only real evidence we have of a master power, a master intellect, because it's death that's the great thing.

56:32.900 --> 56:35.443
It's death that allows for the renewal.

56:36.003 --> 56:39.646
It's death that allows for the improvement of species.

56:40.527 --> 56:45.932
And so I feel very, I agree with him, I feel very strongly death is an absolute necessity.

56:46.520 --> 56:52.911
for our species to continue on this earth, and for at least cultural evolution to continue.

56:53.111 --> 56:54.915
Yeah.

56:54.935 --> 56:59.723
I think that's, you know, about an hour of tape.

56:59.743 --> 57:00.945
Would you inscribe my book?

57:01.085 --> 57:07.997
Oh, sure.

57:08.078 --> 57:08.899
Just exactly enough.
