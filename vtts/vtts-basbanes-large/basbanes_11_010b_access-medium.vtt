WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:03.771
I hate that one.

00:03.791 --> 00:05.375
We run out of tape.

00:05.395 --> 00:05.796
Oh, I know.

00:05.856 --> 00:07.741
I carry the backup tape recorder.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.789
If it's a good interview, you don't have time to think about that anymore.

00:10.809 --> 00:14.057
Well, I carry, like with Coulter yesterday, I didn't have

00:14.746 --> 00:18.110
We ended two hours, and I just clicked on the other tape recorder.

00:18.130 --> 00:18.670
Yeah, yeah.

00:18.690 --> 00:22.534
Instead of taking the time to, you know, be like Hunter with the... Yeah.

00:24.016 --> 00:25.137
Extra guns, yeah.

00:25.157 --> 00:26.098
People say, what's the trick?

00:26.138 --> 00:29.422
I say, carry a lot of quarters, number two pencils, backup batteries.

00:30.062 --> 00:30.683
Yeah, really.

00:31.003 --> 00:33.887
So that'll print out, and that's in this other stuff.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.268
Oh, this is everything here.

00:35.308 --> 00:38.231
This is not a bad photograph, but... Yeah.

00:38.251 --> 00:41.675
You want the wanted poster on that?

00:41.695 --> 00:44.478
I got the wanted poster.

00:44.498 --> 00:44.618
Uh...

00:44.885 --> 00:46.474
That was pretty hilarious.

00:47.197 --> 00:48.399
What about the stuff?

00:48.899 --> 00:55.028
I think you and I are probably going to have to get together towards the end of the week if we can.

00:55.068 --> 00:58.472
Maybe we could do this like this.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.734
You leave your address with me.

00:59.834 --> 01:00.895
I pass this stuff up.

01:00.996 --> 01:02.077
I put it in UPS.

01:02.277 --> 01:03.859
I'll know if you... I pay.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.245
And I can send you a bill and you can have your publisher pay me for the cost.

01:08.345 --> 01:09.607
I can pay you for the cost.

01:10.128 --> 01:11.209
Here's my card.

01:11.289 --> 01:12.771
And then you don't have to worry about it.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.095
You'll get it all and you can just go through it.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.917
Anything I should see today...

01:17.082 --> 01:20.667
The only thing I was going to show you is this.

01:20.687 --> 01:22.009
I don't really know that you'll need the teacher.

01:22.029 --> 01:23.812
What's that lady, Dicciabola?

01:24.032 --> 01:31.423
Oh, I just thought we get Dicci an award because she's basically just a sweetheart lady.

01:31.703 --> 01:34.627
We gave her this award, and I haven't framed it yet.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.491
We haven't given it to her formally.

01:38.152 --> 01:43.200
It's the, what is it, the, well, it doesn't have a name, the award.

01:43.260 --> 01:45.503
Oh, yeah, it's the Library of the Council Award.

01:45.685 --> 01:47.247
He is Peter Grove, by 1997.

01:48.890 --> 01:55.700
And that's actually signed by the Three Musketeers, Andrea and I believe Kathy Brenham.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.805
So it's really the core group of my role.

01:59.966 --> 02:04.393
This is a printout of what's in the book saw.

02:04.413 --> 02:06.616
I'm just going to focus on this, because guess what?

02:07.017 --> 02:08.559
It's on control.

02:08.579 --> 02:09.541
Focusing on white.

02:11.063 --> 02:11.924
Yeah, it's kind of hard.

02:11.944 --> 02:14.308
I took it out of the class, but...

02:14.795 --> 02:20.263
I focused on the pen and then just kept the... This is a printout of Woodson Brooks Hall.

02:21.024 --> 02:24.229
This is 9,300 lines, 187 pages.

02:25.150 --> 02:28.776
Each one of these lines represents a title.

02:28.996 --> 02:29.417
Jesus.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.418
It's just a title.

02:31.981 --> 02:35.105
And some of these titles are like, a lot of these are the periodicals.

02:35.125 --> 02:40.954
They'll have like Landscape Architecture Magazine that goes from, you know, this 1916 to 1980s.

02:41.710 --> 02:42.911
That's one line.

02:42.951 --> 02:53.502
Walter, what you're offering to do here is to give me all of your... Well, I don't really know that you need this, but you might want to... No, I don't.

02:54.163 --> 02:56.525
You know, I don't want to burden you with this stuff.

02:56.605 --> 03:00.469
This stuff you want, because this is clippings.

03:00.809 --> 03:04.593
I only save this to do what you're doing.

03:04.613 --> 03:09.958
And since you're doing it, and I never really intended to do it anyway, this is what it was for.

03:09.978 --> 03:10.519
This is your stuff.

03:10.820 --> 03:13.445
You collected this.

03:13.465 --> 03:19.677
Because I really, I have, this is all just, it's an archive, and I don't look back at this.

03:19.697 --> 03:21.580
Let me give you another card in case you lose that one.

03:22.101 --> 03:22.843
I don't look back.

03:25.448 --> 03:32.541
Right now we're working on culture, and culture will leave, and we're meeting with Minudri on the 30th.

03:33.027 --> 03:43.503
And by the end of the year, the essence of the heavy lifting in this thing will be behind us.

03:43.783 --> 03:46.908
And at that point, my job is done.

03:47.529 --> 03:55.821
I said at the very beginning of this thing, once Brooks Hall is safe, the collections in Brooks Hall are safe, I'm finished.

03:55.842 --> 03:58.185
That's why I got into this, to save the books in Brooks Hall.

03:58.245 --> 04:00.148
Everything else was just the means to get there.

04:00.517 --> 04:02.459
I have my own 800 number.

04:02.519 --> 04:03.260
Okay.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.241
Yeah, I used to have one.

04:04.261 --> 04:07.525
And they'll ask you for the PIN number, which is 92.

04:07.545 --> 04:09.307
Okay, 92.

04:09.327 --> 04:09.667
Okay.

04:10.288 --> 04:16.094
So, at that point, you know, come Christmas or early next year sometime, I'll be done with this.

04:16.114 --> 04:17.576
And, you know, I'm on this other thing.

04:17.596 --> 04:21.039
I've got projects up my butt, but I've got to get back to it.

04:21.059 --> 04:23.021
So, do you consider your efforts in vain?

04:23.282 --> 04:23.702
Oh, no.

04:23.762 --> 04:25.444
I think it's been fairly successful.

04:25.464 --> 04:26.625
We don't want every battle.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.127
Success measured by what, though?

04:28.462 --> 04:33.308
Well, we set out to do some things that are very specific.

04:34.169 --> 04:35.852
We did those things.

04:36.933 --> 04:40.858
And I think that the democracy of the public library is coming back to the library.

04:40.878 --> 04:54.756
There seems to be a... You know, there's... Well, you know, they always said... They always said the San Francisco... You know, they always said, when they were promoting the new Maine, Stephen Coulter is the one I believe that said it, this is the last bastion of democracy.

04:55.377 --> 05:00.905
And yet, when I got involved with this in June, there was no democracy.

05:00.945 --> 05:03.128
Librarians will tell you there hasn't been any democracy for years.

05:03.148 --> 05:07.194
And I think with this demonstration... Sheffield will tell you there hasn't been any democracy for three generations.

05:07.414 --> 05:14.784
I think what this demonstrates is that civilian oversight... Yeah, it can have consequences.

05:14.804 --> 05:16.427
It can have consequences.

05:16.447 --> 05:16.727
Yeah, yeah.

05:16.842 --> 05:19.866
Well, it's like James said... Would you say something like that?

05:20.567 --> 05:37.010
No, I would say that, like James said the other day, and I'll just kind of paraphrase him, he said, you know, it's enough to give you some faith in humanity, you know, to know that the citizens still can pack a punch, you know, and be represented.

05:38.512 --> 05:42.057
You know, we were up against the government and the media when we started.

05:42.577 --> 05:43.458
And the media.

05:43.659 --> 05:44.240
And the media.

05:44.420 --> 05:48.848
So the media kind of has demonstrated by the tape, and you're going to let me leave with that tape, too?

05:48.868 --> 05:49.489
Yeah, that's yours.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.292
Or do you want to ship it?

05:51.372 --> 05:54.096
No, no, you take it, and then... That I can copy.

05:54.116 --> 05:56.120
That you can copy and send it back to me.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.083
You know, other stuff I don't care about.

05:58.143 --> 05:59.385
This is me on TV.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.168
I've got to have a copy of it.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.632
Do you have a little thing to put it in?

06:04.173 --> 06:04.414
Yeah.

06:04.434 --> 06:05.175
Like that.

06:05.678 --> 06:08.202
Let me write on it what it is.

06:08.302 --> 06:11.227
Do you want to write on it what it is?

06:11.527 --> 06:12.168
I'll do it.

06:12.228 --> 06:13.510
How about right here?

06:13.731 --> 06:14.151
Do you mind?

06:14.452 --> 06:15.674
No, fine.

06:17.036 --> 06:19.299
You know, you have to realize I have so many collections.

06:19.319 --> 06:21.303
I have a garage full of collections.

06:21.383 --> 06:22.344
I've got like four or five.

06:22.364 --> 06:29.716
I'm working on a project out at Berkeley where we're archiving 400,000 San Francisco blueprints going back to 1907.

06:29.736 --> 06:31.078
That's a lifetime.

06:31.328 --> 06:36.556
So this for me is, you know, is kind of, I'm trying to find some closure here.

06:36.736 --> 06:39.681
And maybe Ash, I could kind of phone in the plane.

06:39.721 --> 06:40.302
Yeah, right.

06:40.382 --> 06:41.784
No, yeah, exactly.

06:41.804 --> 06:44.949
You might be getting dumped with everything that I have.

06:45.149 --> 06:46.591
Let me also say this is not a whole book.

06:46.611 --> 06:47.773
This is a chapter in a book.

06:47.853 --> 06:53.722
But being in archives myself, I love people dumping on me, you know, when they give me boxes full of stuff.

06:53.782 --> 06:57.728
But you have to understand this is going to be a chapter in a book, maybe 20,000 words.

06:58.108 --> 07:00.492
And it's also going to be an opportunity to discuss...

07:00.742 --> 07:07.609
I like the case study approach, but also I like to go off and talk about, you know, the big picture.

07:07.669 --> 07:10.192
I imagine he'll write some articles based on this research.

07:10.212 --> 07:10.552
I hope so, yeah.

07:10.592 --> 07:13.456
I'm doing a piece now for Civilization, which is a great magazine.

07:13.576 --> 07:13.956
Yeah, it is.

07:13.976 --> 07:17.500
Murray Sendak, and who's going to be in this new book.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.662
Is that the Wilson Center's publication?

07:20.043 --> 07:25.488
No, it's kind of Elsie, but they don't, you know, it's kind of... That's right.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.070
Right, right, right.

07:27.353 --> 07:30.036
Yeah, actually, I used to, you know, who runs the L.C.

07:30.097 --> 07:30.317
now?

07:30.717 --> 07:31.478
James Billington.

07:31.578 --> 07:32.259
Billington.

07:32.279 --> 07:33.441
I used to work for Billington.

07:33.461 --> 07:35.023
Oh, I've interviewed him for this book.

07:35.043 --> 07:35.604
Is that right?

07:35.624 --> 07:40.330
I've interviewed Billington, Barton Grigori, and Paul LeClerc at the public library.

07:40.350 --> 07:43.354
Yeah, Billington, I used to work for him at the Wilson Center.

07:43.474 --> 07:44.295
I used to record a lot of it.

07:44.315 --> 07:45.276
An interesting man.

07:45.476 --> 07:49.902
I sat through five, six years of listening to the Trilateral Commission plan that

07:50.084 --> 07:55.733
They're overthrowing the world for breakfast.

07:55.793 --> 07:58.257
It was a breakfast talk.

07:58.718 --> 08:01.403
I always said it was sort of the defining power breakfast.

08:03.126 --> 08:05.049
What was in here that you outlined for me?

08:05.069 --> 08:07.312
I just wanted to show you one mention in here.

08:08.394 --> 08:09.296
And I have one.

08:09.416 --> 08:11.419
And Nick mentions it in his New Yorker.

08:11.439 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, I figured.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.122
I just thought that was fun.

08:13.422 --> 08:18.628
This is from the, I have all these work reports, and you don't need these, so I'm going to keep these.

08:18.668 --> 08:23.033
But these were the monthly construction reports that they did when they built the new main.

08:23.834 --> 08:32.383
And in December of 95, which is four months before it opened, and they just started to seriously move collections into the new building.

08:32.604 --> 08:33.385
Do they say this here?

08:33.865 --> 08:34.606
Yeah.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.028
You don't think I need that?

08:36.668 --> 08:37.790
Yeah, you do need this.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.411
This you need anyway.

08:39.752 --> 08:40.813
So you are going to send me that.

08:41.165 --> 08:43.949
I'll photocopy it right now.

08:44.069 --> 08:46.733
It's in Nick Baker's New York.

08:46.753 --> 08:49.397
All you need is a quote.

08:49.798 --> 08:50.379
It's one quote.

08:50.779 --> 08:53.764
Library staff continued to map the collections into the new building.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.249
Mappers made several visits into the building to measure and confirm shelving.

08:57.309 --> 08:59.292
This is from Kathy Page.

08:59.592 --> 09:02.335
and confirm shelving information on the plans.

09:02.355 --> 09:03.176
And this is the kicker.

09:03.576 --> 09:09.502
Several surprises and errors were discovered that are proceeding to be solved or mitigated.

09:09.542 --> 09:12.105
That should make me agree after that.

09:12.125 --> 09:17.470
And that, you know, that mitigated with the copy of the cover page.

09:17.490 --> 09:17.850
Yeah, sure.

09:18.211 --> 09:20.873
Mitigated is, that's an ugly word.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.176
The resolve I can deal with.

09:23.196 --> 09:27.560
The mitigated man was about to, you know, turn you off.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.582
Nick, I sent that to Nick, and I also do,

09:30.136 --> 09:39.269
How far am I assuming there's no traffic?

09:39.289 --> 09:41.152
How long should it take me to get to Berkeley from here?

09:42.574 --> 09:49.925
I should leave right now if I'm doing 1230.

09:49.985 --> 09:55.874
I'm keeping Friday open totally for emergencies.

09:55.954 --> 09:56.835
I'm okay Friday.

09:57.068 --> 10:09.604
And what I'd like to do is, I mean, you know, if they're going to let us, you know, our message be the only message, then, you know, because it's a staying on message thing.

10:09.685 --> 10:14.371
That was, you know, the work, probably the reading, you know, Kerwin probably went on and on about this.

10:14.471 --> 10:15.833
Where are the books?

10:15.953 --> 10:16.694
Where is the money?

10:17.935 --> 10:21.580
We're still after answers on those questions.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.181
Okay.

10:22.201 --> 10:26.527
Listen, how do I get on to, how do you get to the freeway?

10:26.567 --> 10:26.907
Yeah.

10:27.224 --> 10:27.870
Okay.
