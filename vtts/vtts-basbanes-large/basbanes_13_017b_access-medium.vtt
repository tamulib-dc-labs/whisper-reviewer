WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:04.130
And so we did it.

00:05.132 --> 00:08.378
The show opened on September 10th.

00:08.398 --> 00:11.223
September 11th, as you recall, wasn't a very nice day.

00:11.243 --> 00:12.586
A very happy day for everyone.

00:13.347 --> 00:17.815
And in fact, the attendance of the museum was down for the next few months as it was every place in the country.

00:18.437 --> 00:24.688
But the attendance in this gallery may have been down, but I can tell you it was busy all the time.

00:24.938 --> 00:30.230
And the community came out in force, and I don't actually know, I can't say who all the people were in there.

00:30.471 --> 00:36.484
But my understanding is that it was the community that came out in force for this show.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.168
And it was a wonderful opportunity for anybody.

00:38.208 --> 00:44.382
I mean, it was a great, it's a marvelous manuscript, and here you can actually, this reproduces, this shows you the content of the show.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.034
And a wonderful author by Tom Matthews.

00:47.434 --> 00:52.683
Well, Worcester, where we are from, has one of the largest Armenian communities in the United States.

00:52.703 --> 00:53.624
Ah, okay, right.

00:53.664 --> 00:54.946
And Boston.

00:55.086 --> 00:56.088
Particularly Worcester.

00:56.629 --> 00:57.050
Oh, really?

00:57.150 --> 01:01.176
Yeah, the first, in fact, before Sororian died, he gave a pilgrimage to Worcester.

01:01.396 --> 01:03.981
He had never been to Worcester before.

01:04.842 --> 01:09.289
The first two Armenian churches in America were in Worcester, so it was very, very true.

01:10.163 --> 01:16.414
Well, in other words, there were two separate communities, the California Cerulean community, which came out here, and the Worcester community.

01:16.915 --> 01:20.141
So, we even listened to her hearing about this great exhibition here.

01:20.461 --> 01:20.902
Oh, really?

01:21.163 --> 01:22.325
Oh, wow.

01:22.385 --> 01:23.848
Oh, how interesting.

01:23.868 --> 01:25.951
And so, it's very exciting.

01:25.971 --> 01:27.314
We just missed it.

01:27.554 --> 01:28.175
I guess it closed recently.

01:28.195 --> 01:29.197
Yeah, you just missed it.

01:29.217 --> 01:30.439
It closed three days.

01:30.459 --> 01:31.902
Four weeks ago.

01:32.708 --> 01:34.510
We were trying to get up here.

01:34.530 --> 01:37.453
We were only here for 45 minutes or so.

01:37.493 --> 01:38.294
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:38.334 --> 01:39.955
Anyway, that would give you some idea.

01:39.976 --> 01:40.916
It was a wonderful book.

01:41.077 --> 01:42.398
And so that was a great opportunity.

01:42.658 --> 01:45.942
You know, for me, as I said, we served an audience.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.404
To me, it's thrilling to show a discount book.

01:48.925 --> 01:51.648
I've never heard a quote like that before.

01:52.709 --> 01:59.796
But, you know, then the public sees something and comes to understand something about books that they never see just going through a regular exhibition.

02:00.350 --> 02:05.278
Well, the Book of Kells.

02:05.719 --> 02:06.961
Each day, one page.

02:07.602 --> 02:10.987
If you want to see the whole book of Kells, you have to go for like a year and a half every day.

02:11.348 --> 02:12.289
Yeah, exactly.

02:12.309 --> 02:13.572
In our exhibitions, we can't do that.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.353
It's not realistic.

02:14.393 --> 02:16.536
So you don't have that many opportunities.

02:16.556 --> 02:17.558
Anyway, let me go get some books.

02:18.259 --> 02:20.723
You want us to stay?

02:20.923 --> 02:21.805
Okay.

02:23.868 --> 02:24.349
Marshall?

02:25.645 --> 02:31.254
So these are my favorite books in the show.

02:31.435 --> 02:35.622
I've been planning this show maybe since the late 80s.

02:35.902 --> 02:40.209
It was originally called The Vase and the Volcanoes.

02:40.330 --> 02:44.717
And then when I went to the British Museum, I was going to borrow some of Cerulean Hamilton's vases.

02:44.933 --> 02:47.736
oh, we're planning a show called Veins and Volcanoes.

02:47.756 --> 02:49.178
And so I sort of shelved it.

02:49.738 --> 02:53.943
And then when there were these interns working on their show, they said, why don't you do something?

02:53.963 --> 02:54.704
You have great things.

02:54.724 --> 03:00.470
And I said, oh, I can just wheel this old show out and do it in this space.

03:00.490 --> 03:12.223
But in the meantime, along with Sir William Hamilton's base book, the 10 before gray, and other things, we had bought this amazing map of Naples done in 1776.

03:12.343 --> 03:14.485
And it's a commission.

03:14.752 --> 03:22.221
by the Duke of Dinoya, and also sponsored by the two kings, Charles III and III.

03:22.842 --> 03:30.492
And it was great because it was uncut, and we were a little worried that the margins were going to cause the map maybe not to.

03:30.512 --> 03:31.954
It was also open.

03:31.974 --> 03:33.015
It didn't seem to be a problem.

03:33.035 --> 03:34.918
We just put them all in separate frames.

03:35.679 --> 03:36.860
And it's really impressive.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.223
It's got the panorama at the bottom,

03:39.203 --> 03:42.768
And then it's got this wonderful overhead view of the city.

03:42.948 --> 03:44.710
So this was bound in a book?

03:44.831 --> 03:46.152
Was this in a book?

03:46.252 --> 03:47.734
Usually they were mounted.

03:47.774 --> 03:56.226
There's a very well-known knolling map of Rome, 1748, and they would cut it, mount it on fabric, and then show it.

03:56.246 --> 03:57.027
But this was never cut.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.449
But how would they present it?

03:58.489 --> 04:01.633
For instance, this is clearly the continuation of this.

04:01.917 --> 04:05.501
cut the margins and then paste them on a backing.

04:06.062 --> 04:15.333
And these were shown in these large halls and meeting rooms in chateaux and mantons and things like that.

04:15.393 --> 04:20.099
The most interesting thing about this for me is, who are these books made for?

04:20.119 --> 04:22.742
These books over here are actually made to be read.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.925
You can hold them in your lap.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.190
And some of these are things like the Kennedy's DeRay, the Bayes book,

04:29.491 --> 04:30.993
These huge albums.

04:31.013 --> 04:33.016
They're country house books.

04:33.096 --> 04:34.038
They're so huge.

04:34.098 --> 04:35.700
They're made to be played.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.043
Guide books and souvenirs.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.226
Have you produced a catalog of this?

04:40.427 --> 04:42.309
We have a short catalog list.

04:42.430 --> 04:45.774
Actually, I can hand you the publicity kits.

04:45.814 --> 04:47.156
That was great.

04:47.196 --> 04:49.620
We didn't do a brochure or a catalog.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.863
We did a kind of joint brochure.

04:52.264 --> 04:56.730
And all I do is hand out these press kits because everybody wants objects.

04:56.947 --> 04:59.774
That's hard to do anything, but I won't go there.

05:00.235 --> 05:01.879
I've usually done that sort of thing.

05:01.899 --> 05:12.506
And I was trying to contrast the beginnings of the tourist guidebook here, and the map, and the kind of small guidebook that would take a real track.

05:12.766 --> 05:13.909
Look at this, you see?

05:14.632 --> 05:22.285
When we talk about paratextual elements in books, the type of thing you could never do to replicate a book on a computer.

05:22.305 --> 05:23.708
You could never replicate that.

05:23.768 --> 05:25.811
You have to have that object.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.356
You have to have that object, don't you?

05:28.376 --> 05:29.097
What do you call that?

05:29.718 --> 05:30.520
This is a huge show.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.441
It's a huge show.

05:32.223 --> 05:34.046
They did a lot of these.

05:34.106 --> 05:38.293
This is an 18th century home theatrical format.

05:38.273 --> 06:05.412
they had viewing boxes as well but is it a book would you call it a book or no it's just it's a work on paper it's you know it's it's something else it's like a print it's many prints actually and then they're mounted in the security format they had boxes if you go see devices of wonder you'll see a lot of them so there are several in there the other nice opportunity to come up with digital imaging was you can absolutely

06:05.392 --> 06:18.571
dead-on accurate facsimiles of many of the pages and children so that you mitigate the problem of the opening in the book, which is always a problem.

06:18.911 --> 06:28.986
The man at the Getty Museum who did these photographs was running back and forth between his last and the

06:29.742 --> 06:33.430
actual rare book, and matching colors.

06:33.671 --> 06:43.753
These were the kinds of collections that Hamilton would make for people because he was also interested in geology.

06:44.435 --> 06:49.185
People would ask him to put together very nicely selected

06:49.165 --> 07:02.960
sets of fragments of some of the antiquities or the tufa and the lava and then occasionally he would put little jewel boxes and little other kinds of curiosities in these, put them in a box for people so they could bring them home.

07:02.980 --> 07:06.003
Could you give us 30 seconds on who Hamilton was?

07:06.283 --> 07:15.713
Hamilton was the British ambassador to Naples from 1764 until Naples was really

07:15.693 --> 07:19.101
shutting down under the onslaught of Napoleon in 1800.

07:19.803 --> 07:20.905
So he went there.

07:21.326 --> 07:28.342
He was from a noble, from the Dukes of Hamilton family, but he was a younger son.

07:28.743 --> 07:29.746
So he got nothing.

07:30.207 --> 07:31.269
That's the British system.

07:31.770 --> 07:34.697
So he had a military career, and then he went into the service.

07:34.677 --> 07:47.293
He was raised, his mother was in the service of King George III, and so he was raised as a kind of close colleague of a king, so he was very well positioned and he was sent and enabled.

07:47.313 --> 07:54.762
He was a collector before that, he was a painting collector as well, and he had a very distinguished collection of paintings, prints,

07:54.742 --> 07:56.584
book fragments.

07:56.604 --> 08:03.954
He was one of these eclectic, hilarious, very interesting, very debonair man, and he was very charming.

08:04.014 --> 08:07.398
His first wife played the harpsichord, and she played with Mozart.

08:07.418 --> 08:09.240
We're going to have a performance in March.

08:09.441 --> 08:21.576
It's an evening at Sir Reading Hamilton's, and just before you came out, I was talking with the theater professor, and he's going to do contemporary music, harpsichord concerts, vocal presentations,

08:21.556 --> 08:23.739
Yeah, pretty interesting.

08:23.799 --> 08:35.955
So Hamilton was a very interesting, erudite person who took people in the pictures of this town.

08:35.975 --> 08:41.522
And so we took people on tours all around Mason, showing them the site.

08:41.502 --> 08:46.330
He would take them on a hike up to the volcano.

08:46.751 --> 08:50.978
He himself went as close as possible when the volcano was erupted.

08:51.759 --> 08:58.510
And then they would go around to other places, make collections, go see sites, the excavations.

08:58.530 --> 08:59.131
This is fabulous.

08:59.311 --> 09:00.593
How does the Getty get handled?

09:00.694 --> 09:02.837
Did they acquire all of these things?

09:03.017 --> 09:03.819
No, no.

09:03.999 --> 09:07.645
For years, since 1983, I've been buying them.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.588
I like the introduction a lot.

09:09.608 --> 09:11.912
I think first of all, this is a very interesting time.

09:12.993 --> 09:25.934
And I like the fact that there are pictures of Hamilton holding the vase, showing him with his collection, with his vase, with the view of Naples behind him.

09:25.954 --> 09:28.097
He was a real book collector.

09:28.077 --> 09:31.923
How did I lift them?

09:33.706 --> 09:35.509
I have a copy of it.

09:35.629 --> 09:37.432
I'll give you my article.

09:37.492 --> 09:38.133
It's on Hamilton.

09:38.153 --> 09:39.415
Perfect.

09:40.457 --> 09:42.020
I knew that.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.245
He went around with a group of people.

09:45.265 --> 09:52.417
They were from European port struggles and they all came to use in Hamilton and he would entertain them.

09:52.437 --> 09:53.899
He was a kind of very

09:53.879 --> 09:57.924
But it appears that he collected everything.

09:58.145 --> 09:59.366
He did, he did.

09:59.386 --> 10:00.488
And he knew about it.

10:00.548 --> 10:02.831
He had a very hierarchical sensibility.

10:02.851 --> 10:08.158
Yeah, he collected basers, he took people on these kind of stage tours.

10:08.178 --> 10:14.706
Where is his second wife, Emma, who was the Lady Hamilton's attitude person?

10:14.686 --> 10:18.234
And they did these stage discoveries of antiquity.

10:18.254 --> 10:22.243
So there was range, you know, Lord so-and-so or Count so-and-so.

10:23.225 --> 10:25.049
And the workers would be working, digging away.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.156
Oh, they would find a tomb and a vase and things like that.

10:28.476 --> 10:30.000
And so it was very interesting.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.648
And this is a picture of one of those discoveries.

10:33.688 --> 10:34.770
Now, I guess I'll look at that.

10:34.750 --> 10:45.231
Think of color etching and rising, and this is a kind of experimental politician.

10:45.251 --> 10:48.437
It's the first Colin Price book on our history.

10:48.457 --> 10:50.902
The first coffee table.

10:50.962 --> 10:51.924
Yes, yes.

10:53.146 --> 10:54.649
And we said that they didn't have coffee table.

10:55.422 --> 11:18.966
and these interested me a lot because i realized that before this there were no not whole color plates in art books they were in natural history books they were in maps uh other kinds of science anatomy books we're talking about the naples 1767 this is on your checklist yes 17

11:18.946 --> 11:21.110
66 to 76.

11:21.731 --> 11:26.980
The project went bankrupt in Naples because it was so expensive and so difficult to produce.

11:27.741 --> 11:34.913
And Danko, the author, kind of escaped from Hamilton's grass and then turned up in Florence.

11:34.893 --> 11:52.892
Hamilton's friend who was British Council in Florence said, you know what, we saw Dunkerville arriving the other day and he had a vast group of wagons that were carrying the papers, the plates that were printed, and the proper plates.

11:53.092 --> 11:53.893
Amazing.

11:53.913 --> 11:56.095
It's a very experimental period though.

11:56.295 --> 12:01.120
And as the books went on, volume 1 and volume 2 have colored plates,

12:01.100 --> 12:15.646
and then colored title pages, headpieces and headpieces, initials, this article, they start printing colored initials and headpieces.

12:15.666 --> 12:18.411
So they are experimenting with the publication.

12:18.432 --> 12:24.222
And I wanted to show how they did these, what they did with these initials with the reduced version,

12:24.202 --> 12:33.274
of the same artist's larger plates of view, they would reduce them so that people could recognize the scenes in them.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.439
They also borrowed from Piranesi in some of these initials.

12:36.459 --> 12:38.862
And what do you call these kinds of books here?

12:38.962 --> 12:40.684
View books, would you say.

12:41.145 --> 12:42.106
And you acquired them?

12:42.387 --> 12:42.927
Yes.

12:42.967 --> 12:50.918
Well, they're very important also for our collections on the history of art, archaeology, and architecture.

12:50.898 --> 12:54.303
Because this is the time when art history was taking off.

12:54.323 --> 12:56.687
Winkelmann was working in Rome.

12:56.707 --> 12:59.832
They were aware of Terminati's publication.

12:59.852 --> 13:04.599
And so they were very self-consciously producing these books that were illustrating versions.

13:04.679 --> 13:07.624
The text is the history of art from Antiquiri.

13:08.043 --> 13:10.827
You should tell us how long you've been here, like from the beginning, right?

13:10.848 --> 13:11.969
That's really true, yeah.

13:12.009 --> 13:16.477
So you've actually been here from the very beginning of the development and all, and you really have to tell us about that.

13:16.497 --> 13:16.977
We'll talk about that.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.101
When we get in my office, we can talk about that.

13:19.121 --> 13:24.690
It's really been fun, and I'm about to do a lecture in March on the history of the rare book collection here.

13:24.730 --> 13:27.975
Well, then you can try it out on us if you want.

13:27.955 --> 13:49.643
The other thing they did, they borrowed from other books of prints, and I just did facsimiles of some of these books, as well as these little plastic casts of gems that collectors valued very much at the time, and they put replicas of very famous collectors' gems that people would recognize.

13:50.078 --> 14:12.745
in reduced format in the initials so in some ways the books were decorated like medieval binding like treasure binding okay indulge me for a second now you acquired this book this book is picturing these objects yeah just recently yeah i want to have a good example explain to me this is something i'm interested in that's not a book

14:13.012 --> 14:37.686
it's a tourist object so it was a kind of collection that's kind of what you consider an accessory to the book in a way i wanted one example of these when you close this it looks exactly like a book there are eight volumes and they sit on the shelf and if you pulled it out if you pulled it from the spine you would think you are going to open a book when you open it

14:37.666 --> 14:42.050
period M to 27, just so I could know the title.

14:42.190 --> 14:45.874
Yes, they're by Brachi.

14:46.455 --> 14:59.948
They were in a book format, and inside they made plaster cast replicas with a text on what would be the end paper of exactly what they were.

15:00.028 --> 15:04.112
They were cast of gems from famous collections.

15:04.092 --> 15:11.404
and people who didn't own the gems would collect these in the same way that they would collect the fragments of the stone.

15:11.905 --> 15:25.548
And I wanted to have just one example, it was very inexpensive, I wanted it at an auction, to show the kinds of tourist objects that went along with the books and the prints in the maps that an 18th century person on the Grand Tour would collect.

15:25.568 --> 15:29.475
But I think, not meaning to jump around, this does represent a new attitude.

15:29.455 --> 15:35.442
We do collect other things, as you'll see from Devices of Wonder.

15:35.862 --> 15:49.678
This is an eclectic collection, and it's nice that we don't have a firm collection development policy, but that we can show other aspects of art history, history of collecting, because we don't just collect books here.

15:49.698 --> 15:54.163
We have photos, manuscripts, optical devices.

15:55.088 --> 16:15.915
this is the kind of collecting i'm recommending that a person can do this kind of thing yeah yeah yeah and you don't have to we um i'm the head of the collection development department and we don't we have a policy but we it's not

16:15.895 --> 16:20.904
so firm that we could never get something like that, and I would like to be that way.

16:20.924 --> 16:22.307
That's the beauty of the Getty.

16:22.327 --> 16:24.851
The Getty wants beautiful things.

16:25.012 --> 16:27.156
Well, I think I'm just right.

16:27.176 --> 16:32.305
This collection at the Research Institute is not about the museum's collection.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.988
It's a study collection for our research.

16:34.188 --> 16:50.745
When this performance takes place that the UCLA Taylor professor is planning, at certain points they will have a performance of Lady Hamilton's attitudes, which were based on antique objects, she would do these very slow,

16:50.725 --> 17:07.197
changes of position and then she would be Niobe or she would be the Giraya and things like that and she would take the clothes and classical statues and then she would go into a box and change her garments a little bit.

17:07.217 --> 17:08.619
This is Emma Hart.

17:08.659 --> 17:09.341
This is Emma Hart.

17:09.461 --> 17:10.523
This is her second wife.

17:10.503 --> 17:22.875
She had a background in student in London, and she was sent actually by Hamilton's nephew, who didn't want her as a girlfriend anymore, and she was sent off to Naples.

17:23.227 --> 17:26.049
to get rid of her, to read her sad stories.

17:26.069 --> 17:28.331
And gradually, she was very, very beautiful.

17:28.452 --> 17:33.916
She was painted by Romero and Reynolds, and Hamilton fell in love with her.

17:33.936 --> 17:37.559
Isn't that great that she made out all of her work?

17:37.579 --> 17:37.800
Yeah, yeah.

17:37.820 --> 17:38.520
What a fear.

17:38.540 --> 17:39.741
They were meant to be together.

17:39.801 --> 17:41.102
She learned Italian.

17:41.723 --> 17:51.111
She became a good friend of Queen Maria Carolina, who was one of Maria Theresa's daughters who was married off to different kings around Europe.

17:51.131 --> 17:53.233
And then, she was very, very beautiful.

17:53.213 --> 17:55.377
And so she gave these performances.

17:55.918 --> 18:00.947
She was almost another part of Hamilton's collection.

18:01.007 --> 18:12.668
This is a fabulous note here that maybe she entertained visitors with performances of striking poses based on antique subjects that became known to her as they asked.

18:12.688 --> 18:14.351
So it's the objects.

18:14.371 --> 18:15.292
Exactly what she just said.

18:15.313 --> 18:16.475
These were recording prints.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.837
They were published in North Italy.

18:17.817 --> 18:40.551
and they were very popular there are quite a few sets of these prints by different artists and so these documents her her performance is based on her antiques as well as these beautiful paintings that were done of her by a well-known artist i wanted to show one of the bones of the antiquities of ercolano partially because

18:40.987 --> 18:50.730
The Getty Museum Villa, which is going to open again in 2004, is based on where all the buildings that are going on at the beginning of the day is appearing.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.156
And so that was an important exception.

18:53.176 --> 18:58.067
And it shows one of the murals that Emma Hart and she really needed to start.

18:58.570 --> 19:03.761
She based her performances on it when she was talking about it.

19:03.781 --> 19:13.241
It's this very rich period when everything is feeding into everything else and so far, which is growing up.

19:13.401 --> 19:16.748
And then finally, I wanted to show

19:16.728 --> 19:36.613
Well, they took pictures, these three-dimensional paintings on the Antiphazes, and converted them into a page that was a two-dimensional colored print, documented a vase into a wooden vase book.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.154
Is that right?

19:37.174 --> 19:39.597
I've never seen anything like this before.

19:40.285 --> 19:43.492
hand-colored, but also done with some stencils.

19:43.592 --> 19:47.480
If you look at the book from the side, you can see the stencil technique.

19:47.500 --> 19:56.519
The reason why I started to work on these is I'd invited Merle Adelson, who was also here, and I said, well, have they been collated?

19:56.539 --> 19:58.243
And everybody said, what?

19:58.223 --> 20:00.006
Well, yes, we do.

20:00.607 --> 20:04.274
So I sat down with them, and they were the most extraordinary books.

20:04.294 --> 20:09.163
And I decided, you know, I don't think anyone's been in a show channel.

20:09.183 --> 20:09.724
They hadn't.

20:10.305 --> 20:13.431
See, he's holding one of these books in his lap.

20:13.411 --> 20:34.457
There were a couple auction sales when Emma went back to London, he died in 1903 back in London, and then she needed money and saw there were these famous sales.

20:34.437 --> 20:39.464
And I went back and I wanted to know what his book collection was like.

20:39.664 --> 20:48.656
He was going to tell us about the tour.

20:48.676 --> 20:51.460
So it's kind of nice that I have an acrylic book flavor.

20:53.323 --> 20:57.048
Did you sign in here?

20:57.068 --> 20:58.690
They signed in over there.

20:59.429 --> 21:10.422
So you said about 800,000 margins?

21:10.442 --> 21:10.523
Yes.

21:10.543 --> 21:12.645
And you said you were just buying like this.

21:12.725 --> 21:20.054
From 1983 on, we were buying large collections and single items.

21:20.074 --> 21:26.362
Initially, we bought large collections just to have a collection in order to fill in.

21:26.382 --> 21:27.343
When I came here,

21:27.661 --> 21:33.512
It was very difficult to know what to buy, because you could look at a dealer's catalog and buy anything.

21:34.574 --> 21:41.087
And we couldn't do that, you know, responsibly, just in terms of buying.

21:44.734 --> 21:47.639
So, if you want to get a little insight, it's perfect.

21:47.659 --> 21:48.100
Yeah, exactly.

21:50.341 --> 22:02.151
There are many, many book dealers in town.

22:02.191 --> 22:04.834
We used book dealers.

22:04.994 --> 22:20.247
The way that we were able to build a collection was to use very good book dealers, rely on their expertise, let them know what we were looking for, and they were guaranteed.

22:26.183 --> 22:43.200
because we were paying, not outrageous prices, but we were on the high end of the market, because we were bringing in these large collections, things like Theodore Besterman's Duplicates.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.464
He gave his collection of old art books.

22:46.484 --> 22:52.630
It was published in this large catalogue to, it's actually right up there, it's dark blue and on the top shelf,

22:53.200 --> 22:55.463
And that seemed like an excellent collection.

22:55.503 --> 23:05.118
It was art historical, architectural, gardens, treatises, a great collection of a basic rare book library on art history.

23:06.079 --> 23:12.689
And that came through a dealer, and he had collated the books for us and guaranteed their quality.

23:13.129 --> 23:18.297
And so it's funny because at the time it seemed as though there were prices.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.199
They seem like the biggest bargains in the world.

23:21.259 --> 23:23.241
I was just thinking about that last night.

23:24.382 --> 23:28.426
Yeah, yeah.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.989
It's the big blue book on the top shelf.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.912
See the thing that says old art books?

23:33.932 --> 23:35.013
Just keep going to the right.

23:36.054 --> 23:37.316
To the right, to the right, to the right.

23:37.896 --> 23:38.177
There.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.878
Right there.

23:39.898 --> 23:42.761
We can take it out if you want to.

23:42.781 --> 23:43.382
Just pull it out.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.364
Oh, we can look at it later.

23:45.698 --> 23:50.327
One thing you'll notice is, notice that all the shelves in this library have these bars across the earthquake.

23:50.347 --> 23:54.354
And we've been having a lot lately.

23:54.574 --> 23:55.256
Earthquake bars.

23:55.997 --> 24:04.753
Because in the 94 earthquake, we realized that if people had been there, they would have, you know this famous picture of the book Fool?

24:05.088 --> 24:08.232
And, you know, the shelves are falling down on him, and he's dying.

24:08.252 --> 24:11.817
I don't know if that picture of it sounds pretty good.

24:11.977 --> 24:17.684
It's in the famous books of fools, and there's the book fool, and the shelf is about to destroy him.

24:17.704 --> 24:27.757
And since that was our experience during this last very severe earthquake, they did things like stabilize the shelves and then put fronts on them.

24:28.538 --> 24:31.622
And then down in our vaults, all the shelves are locked together.

24:31.662 --> 24:32.884
They're rolling, and they're locked.

24:33.353 --> 24:35.015
so that the books won't fall off.

24:35.076 --> 24:39.542
They're just big blocks of shelving on these rolling tracks.

24:40.023 --> 24:44.249
I thought they were places to hang them.

24:44.590 --> 24:45.050
No.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.335
Safety concerns.

24:48.415 --> 24:57.509
So basically you're developing two parallel collections of reference research type library and a rare book.

24:57.529 --> 25:01.535
And there are different policies for each one of those.

25:01.695 --> 25:03.057
The general library

25:03.863 --> 25:08.788
is now going towards being a library that documents world art.

25:08.848 --> 25:17.818
We started with traditional art history, so it was about Western European antiquity to contemporary.

25:18.579 --> 25:21.082
And then we brought in South America.

25:21.122 --> 25:22.664
We bought Australian collections.

25:22.684 --> 25:26.868
We didn't go too much into Africa and Asia because of the vernacular languages.

25:27.389 --> 25:32.014
We're now just about to discuss where we're going in terms of Asia.

25:32.467 --> 25:35.310
because so much more work has been done in art history in Asia.

25:35.751 --> 25:36.672
It's huge.

25:36.692 --> 25:36.912
Yeah.

25:37.793 --> 25:38.695
We worked like crazy.

25:38.715 --> 25:40.056
You can't imagine.

25:40.076 --> 25:45.523
I came from a state university library, the University of Missouri, which was an old art historical collection.

25:45.983 --> 25:47.946
They bought their books in the 19th century.

25:48.907 --> 25:49.808
Nice library.

25:49.828 --> 25:55.075
The College Art Association was founded in Missouri, so it was a very traditional, humanistic collection.

25:55.675 --> 26:00.381
My professor there, because I was the art librarian there and my degrees are from there,

26:00.952 --> 26:03.436
He was named Helmut Lehmannhaupt for years.

26:03.736 --> 26:04.978
He wrote the Krauss catalog.

26:05.699 --> 26:09.064
I met him, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

26:09.084 --> 26:10.105
I loved what he did.

26:10.726 --> 26:12.409
The art, you know, the art history and the book.

26:12.429 --> 26:14.692
Yeah, well, would you describe him as a mentor in this?

26:14.712 --> 26:17.977
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, a mentor and a kind of model.

26:18.117 --> 26:29.133
And he was very German, and so he came and he lectured, and he didn't chair and have office hours with students and things like that.

26:29.373 --> 26:30.435
He was very formal.

26:30.652 --> 26:52.174
But he was also a very interesting art historian who worked with early printing and some of the transitional books like the block books and the, what do you call it, the penning drawings in books and that kind of illustration.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.997
He did this famous book called Gutenberg and the Master of the Playing Cards.

26:55.897 --> 27:00.422
And he was amazing.

27:01.094 --> 27:02.696
wanted to do what he did.

27:02.756 --> 27:04.198
That was based on a shitey vibe on it.

27:04.538 --> 27:05.819
Yes, yes, exactly.

27:05.859 --> 27:13.308
The little bears and the, you know, things like that in the margins that they realized had actually been made from copper plates, from playing cards.

27:13.328 --> 27:15.390
Yeah, that's a very important monograph.

27:15.410 --> 27:16.171
Yeah, yeah.

27:16.191 --> 27:30.207
And then, here for me to be his research assistant, and I was so happy working for him for three years, and in that time we surveyed the Missouri stacks and we pulled the rare books out and put them in special collections, and it was an excellent experience for him.

27:30.338 --> 27:32.300
Were you planning to be a librarian at this point?

27:32.320 --> 27:35.444
I was just going to be an art librarian and work on rare books for my research.

27:36.085 --> 27:46.157
And then, I guess I was at Missouri for about ten years as the art librarian, and I taught courses in the literature of the humanities.

27:46.177 --> 27:55.327
So I talked about why music books looked different from Bibles, and when collected works started in the eighteenth century and nineteenth century.

27:55.347 --> 27:58.371
It was fun, because I could pull out rare books and show people.

27:58.891 --> 28:01.774
What do you mean by when collected books started?

28:02.154 --> 28:08.640
When collected books, when it was thought important to collect an author's work and do a kind of octavo edition of them.

28:08.660 --> 28:11.262
You don't think it was prior to that?

28:11.643 --> 28:12.143
Not too much.

28:12.203 --> 28:15.086
Pretty much the 18th century thing.

28:15.566 --> 28:17.067
Why theater books look different.

28:17.087 --> 28:21.972
How they evolved from playbooks to illustrated editions.

28:21.992 --> 28:22.993
It was really fun.

28:23.033 --> 28:24.414
I had a great time doing that.

28:24.434 --> 28:27.717
I had a wonderful old humanities collection.

28:28.372 --> 28:31.856
And I was able to come to UCLA and teach that for a while.

28:32.037 --> 28:42.350
And then, probably interesting enough for this book that you're writing, I realized when electronic and digitized things began to happen, that the course would have to change a lot.

28:43.071 --> 28:45.454
And I would have to do a lot more research.

28:45.474 --> 28:49.118
And we were beginning to move the collections and be open at that time.

28:49.219 --> 28:50.901
And I just went, you know what?

28:51.161 --> 28:55.847
I can't do this anymore because the book world is beginning to change.

28:56.333 --> 29:01.319
And the other thing was I didn't know how it was happening, and I felt kind of like the water was getting too deep.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.881
I got scared.

29:03.001 --> 29:05.364
I just thought, oh, I can't teach this course for a while.

29:06.105 --> 29:07.327
We don't have any perspective right now.

29:07.347 --> 29:08.208
What was the name of the course again?

29:08.228 --> 29:10.511
It was just called Literature of Humanities.

29:10.531 --> 29:14.336
But it went from the Renaissance to the 20th century.

29:14.356 --> 29:16.799
So what were you afraid about in terms of the computer, though?

29:16.819 --> 29:17.660
I didn't know what I was doing.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.885
You know, I needed to know all the different ways in which all the different humanities

29:22.169 --> 29:33.060
were adopting electronic formats or using those kinds of things and I would have had to go into philosophy and religion and I just kind of ran away.

29:33.460 --> 29:37.244
Is that impacting your thoughts on how you're collecting for the Getty now?

29:37.424 --> 29:39.427
Yes, very much so.

29:39.447 --> 29:50.758
What are the more permanent formats and what are the transitional ones and how is it important to try to collect some of those transitional formats, particularly in terms of special collections and

29:51.110 --> 29:57.778
in art history because the contemporary art world goes across media now.

29:58.559 --> 30:01.502
You know, they use videos and they use sound.

30:02.704 --> 30:06.629
They do performance art, artist books.

30:06.649 --> 30:09.532
So you're thinking maybe you don't need the printed books?

30:09.692 --> 30:10.073
Oh, no.

30:10.794 --> 30:11.695
Oh, no.

30:11.715 --> 30:13.337
Oh, no.

30:14.198 --> 30:16.340
I would jump off the balcony before I would say that.

30:16.400 --> 30:16.641
Oh, no.

30:16.681 --> 30:20.425
I think printed books, interestingly enough,

30:20.962 --> 30:25.247
are the format that has lasted the longest and is the most stable.

30:26.028 --> 30:28.170
Is that not interesting?

30:28.210 --> 30:29.131
That fascinates me.

30:29.171 --> 30:30.172
You're preaching to the choir.

30:30.292 --> 30:30.853
Yeah, I know.

30:31.073 --> 30:37.300
But that's like this kind of article of the first principle of my life.

30:37.540 --> 30:45.349
I like people who are eponymous, and so I like the fact that my name is Marsha Reed, and I love to read.

30:45.869 --> 30:54.760
And so I love to meet people who are like that, you know, who have names that say something about what their interests are.

30:54.800 --> 31:01.128
There's a dealer that I was just working with in New York last week, this man named Armin Kuntz, who works for C.J.

31:01.148 --> 31:03.631
Berner and Artemis Buxian.

31:03.651 --> 31:06.395
It's close enough to Kuntz so that, you know, he works in art.

31:07.136 --> 31:07.897
I like that.

31:08.357 --> 31:10.320
It doesn't always work.

31:11.061 --> 31:14.425
But you were saying how it is affecting your acquisition.

31:14.776 --> 31:16.618
Yeah.

31:17.159 --> 31:18.200
We have to stay with that.

31:18.280 --> 31:27.890
If we're documenting the literature, continue broadly, as how researchers work, we must take that into account.

31:28.751 --> 31:30.432
Otherwise, we would be in the lead-up category.

31:30.452 --> 31:35.478
Well, that question you have to take into account when you don't pursue one at the expense of the other.

31:36.639 --> 31:38.301
No.

31:38.321 --> 31:39.021
No.

31:39.061 --> 31:42.865
We would never be able to... If a monograph is published, you're going to acquire that monograph.

31:42.886 --> 31:43.006
Yeah.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.327
You're not going to wait and see it.

31:45.185 --> 31:56.704
But then all these, I mean, artists now are working very seriously on electronic formats, and we're discussing how are we going to collect that.

31:56.964 --> 31:58.807
Who is going to collect it?

31:58.827 --> 32:03.114
The other thing that's very clear, I think, is that you can't collect everything anymore.

32:03.195 --> 32:10.146
No library, no repository can do it all, and so you have to

32:11.645 --> 32:21.536
Have, at least in the corner of your eye, what other people are doing, and then that should inform your collecting in some way.

32:21.556 --> 32:29.185
Now, Marcia, you said you came in 1983, and I'm to remind you that we hope you have a copy of an essay that you wrote on.

32:29.205 --> 32:30.887
Yeah, the collector's books.

32:31.007 --> 32:35.052
Yeah, I'll write myself a note.

32:36.273 --> 32:39.357
But when you think about it, your tenure here,

32:39.843 --> 32:44.591
almost precisely coincides with this whole Internet explosion, doesn't it?

32:44.611 --> 32:45.492
Yeah, yeah.

32:45.512 --> 32:52.043
The 80s is when this thing, when the impact of it, when the consequences of it, when people start really saying the book is dead.

32:52.363 --> 32:52.644
Yeah.

32:52.764 --> 32:53.265
This is it.

32:53.325 --> 32:54.627
This is when it starts.

32:54.647 --> 33:01.057
About the time that she's coming here and is mandated to build and really given the... A library.

33:01.598 --> 33:05.985
Yeah, to build a library and to be given the... I mean, you must be the envy of everything.

33:06.522 --> 33:19.157
Well, except for the amount of work I have to do, they might want to, because everybody always says, even in New York, they call their club, oh, you guys have all the money, I guess you can buy anything.

33:20.238 --> 33:21.119
Terrible.

33:21.900 --> 33:28.327
That and the other statement that almost made me fall off my chair at dinner was, do you ever pay attention to the market value?

33:28.348 --> 33:31.391
Do you ever look at the, you know, just price of things you buy?

33:31.451 --> 33:33.053
Oh, yeah.

33:33.353 --> 33:35.055
That's all the work we do.

33:35.095 --> 33:42.264
We spend our life in the CD-ROM of American Book Price is Current, and then we do press research all the time.

33:43.105 --> 33:46.509
How anyone could think that we just cut a check?

33:46.709 --> 33:53.437
That's scary.

33:58.063 --> 34:01.487
Did you work on the Devices of Wonder exhibition now?

34:02.041 --> 34:05.946
Only because my colleague, we've been here the longest.

34:06.006 --> 34:10.672
Frances Turfak and I have both been here since 1983.

34:10.832 --> 34:17.521
And so as I was buying books, we were working very closely on things that she might be interested in.

34:18.001 --> 34:20.625
She says she's worked on that show for seven years.

34:21.286 --> 34:24.570
In fact, I think she's been thinking about it longer.

34:25.191 --> 34:31.879
The real genesis is that Werner Nikis collection of optical devices in pre-cinematics.

34:32.433 --> 34:41.647
books, but we're very close friends, and so in a way, peripherally, the department has seven curators, and it's very collaborative.

34:42.529 --> 34:49.279
So whenever it's a large collection that we're working on, it's usually a group of two or so, and then we discuss everything.

34:49.680 --> 34:53.686
But I do like the fact that you do pull from all the different departments, and you really do.

34:53.706 --> 34:55.128
It's a unique kind of an exhibition.

34:55.329 --> 34:59.976
Yeah, it's amazing.

35:00.378 --> 35:06.406
Everything does seem to generate from a collection that's here.

35:06.507 --> 35:13.877
Or group, you know, maybe... A group of things, I guess, but making sense, making a narrative out of the objects, perhaps, is that not fair?

35:14.257 --> 35:26.775
When I did this other show, which is called The Edible Monument, it was based on a special impression.

35:26.795 --> 35:27.516
The Edible Monument.

35:28.441 --> 35:33.809
Based on the festival collections, it had to do with banquets and presentation of food.

35:33.829 --> 35:45.808
And so sometimes it takes a thematic and then uses that thematic to tell people about things.

35:46.514 --> 35:51.222
I'm trying to find the recipe part.

35:51.422 --> 36:00.497
And it was really fun to do that, but I also, I'm always thinking that I want to tell people about a certain kind of rare book or collection.

36:01.018 --> 36:03.863
Yeah, you know what, and here's your folder.

36:03.963 --> 36:04.484
Here we go.

36:04.504 --> 36:08.891
These are the object lists for all of the grand toy shows.

36:09.011 --> 36:12.437
Oh, the press release.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.926
How about your current food marches?

36:15.046 --> 36:16.649
Yes.

36:17.550 --> 36:24.419
Because Edible Monument, I didn't realize that there's a huge world of foodies and gourmet cooks.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.742
Can we staple it right here so we don't have it?

36:26.762 --> 36:28.284
Sure, sure.

36:29.466 --> 36:31.970
You don't mind that we are.

36:31.990 --> 36:32.751
We won't get lost.

36:32.811 --> 36:35.594
We've seen a coordinator yet.

36:35.615 --> 36:39.640
A lot of papers and whatever.

36:39.974 --> 36:43.517
Oh, it was wild.

36:47.521 --> 36:50.483
You can't imagine what was going on.

36:50.503 --> 37:04.295
At one point, Martha Stewart wanted to come, and we got all kinds of publicity in the restaurant, and Bon Appetit, and Gourmet, and things like that.

37:04.936 --> 37:08.479
When was it?

37:08.712 --> 37:25.647
And what my big acts that I'm always trying to grind in a kind of, you know, not terribly, I don't know, heavy-handed way, was that this is why we collect our books.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.129
This is what you can find out.

37:27.169 --> 37:30.031
This is how you can know about what people did.

37:30.092 --> 37:35.176
I'm just making sure that when I hear really good things like that, I'm just making sure I'm getting it, which we are.

37:35.256 --> 37:36.137
Yep, go ahead.

37:36.944 --> 37:41.451
So it was so good, because of course the chefs didn't know about this.

37:41.471 --> 37:42.613
Of course the bread makers.

37:42.693 --> 37:48.903
We had people coming here to do demonstrations of how you actually made those things and with pictures.

37:48.963 --> 37:55.033
But then all the chefs arrived with their scrapbooks, and people were sending me videos of their food pieces.

37:55.113 --> 37:56.715
And it was wild.

37:56.996 --> 38:00.221
I didn't know that there was this enormous world of food.

38:00.241 --> 38:04.808
So not only the rare book people and the print people were interested in that, because that's what

38:05.075 --> 38:06.997
I thought the show was about.

38:07.638 --> 38:14.286
And festivals, ephemeral art made for festivals as shown in these books, because the courts would send them out.

38:14.947 --> 38:18.312
And then the other courts would copy and say, oh, look what happened to Versailles.

38:18.772 --> 38:20.414
We in Austria have to do this.

38:20.434 --> 38:23.318
So then they'd do a similar thing in Vienna.

38:23.338 --> 38:26.442
And they'd copy the Medici and stuff like that.

38:26.482 --> 38:28.144
So it was very interesting.

38:28.945 --> 38:30.567
But they have all these different dimensions.

38:30.647 --> 38:33.951
So whenever you put out your books on a certain subject,

38:34.420 --> 38:37.463
You get the print people and the book people and the science.

38:37.563 --> 38:45.652
The Fringe has huge amounts of people in science who are interested in the optical devices and the kinds of images that they take.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.576
But then we had a whole other section of the magicians.

38:50.498 --> 38:52.760
And then children like that show.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.545
Devices of Wonder was amazingly popular with children.

38:56.605 --> 39:00.529
So people came and then they made a second visit and they brought their children with you.

39:00.897 --> 39:13.013
Yeah, it's very nice to do things like that that aren't just for a certain public who could only appreciate old master drawings or paintings or things like that.

39:13.573 --> 39:15.956
People really like books.

39:16.777 --> 39:18.259
We really have to distinguish.

39:18.319 --> 39:25.369
I mean, Getty has what, seven different, or how many different characters?

39:25.389 --> 39:28.052
I guess what Tom does is really different from what you do.

39:28.285 --> 39:33.472
We've had books in a very generic sense, but maybe you could just tell us a little bit.

39:33.593 --> 39:37.959
What Tom does is study illuminated manuscripts, and that's a branch of art history.

39:38.400 --> 39:56.706
And what we do is talk about art history in terms of its documents, but not so much the high art that everybody associates with art history, like the Mona Lisa or like the well-known paintings, say,

39:57.445 --> 40:00.147
paintings of Rembrandt or something like that.

40:01.168 --> 40:09.956
Ours are not so valuable documents that art historians use or other people use.

40:09.976 --> 40:22.647
I mean, that's the other thing we're finding is that cultural historians come here and musicologists and theater historians to study visual aspects of it or to study descriptions.

40:23.328 --> 40:26.170
So this place is about

40:26.572 --> 40:34.242
research and study and scholarship, whereas the museum is really about exhibition of art itself.

40:34.262 --> 40:39.288
Two entirely different mandates, really, when you think about it in the same place.

40:39.309 --> 40:39.529
Yeah, yeah.

40:39.549 --> 40:42.593
I think it's interesting to talk about how the public enjoys the book or loves the book.

40:43.033 --> 40:50.503
Yeah, I mean, that's the interesting thing to me, is that people really like books, and they come into these exhibits

40:51.023 --> 40:55.329
And they start talking about their memories or their experiences.

40:55.449 --> 40:57.392
And maybe they do that with art.

40:58.073 --> 41:01.318
But I think books are more accessible to people.

41:01.378 --> 41:10.151
Or these objects like road maps or peep shows, they're a little bit more immediate in people's experience.

41:10.171 --> 41:15.819
Maybe they don't have a large painting on their wall of a mythological scene.

41:15.839 --> 41:17.001
But everybody reads books.

41:17.061 --> 41:18.984
Everybody owns books.

41:19.004 --> 41:20.406
Lots of people collect.

41:21.382 --> 41:22.243
That's the idea.

41:22.263 --> 41:27.312
People are really—collecting seems to be this activity, yeah.

41:27.793 --> 41:28.734
I guess that's what the N.T.

41:28.754 --> 41:29.736
Swoet Show tells us.

41:40.474 --> 41:47.305
Well, I love—they had an episode on—they've had their two brothers last week, you know.

41:47.504 --> 41:48.846
And it was for children.

41:49.327 --> 41:51.710
It was about getting children together, collecting.

41:52.131 --> 41:56.857
They have different episodes of the Antiques Roadshow in New Hampshire than I see here.

41:56.897 --> 42:00.062
It must be different public, you know, TVs.

42:00.082 --> 42:02.005
Yeah, I don't think they all had them at the same time.

42:02.786 --> 42:08.394
And the brothers had kept a notebook since I think they were, it was either age 8 or 11.

42:08.915 --> 42:16.245
And at the beginning of it, they wrote, we are antique collectors in this cute, you know, sort of children's handwriting.

42:16.512 --> 42:20.938
And then they were going around writing notes on each piece.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.460
They would try to draw a picture.

42:22.500 --> 42:23.762
They would take measurements.

42:24.263 --> 42:27.347
And it was about how you become a professional dealer.

42:28.289 --> 42:35.098
My father retired when he was 50, and he went to New Hampshire and sold military antiques and barometers.

42:35.759 --> 42:40.766
He's the second barometer maker in New Hampshire, and I have one of his barometers.

42:41.407 --> 42:42.869
He made his own barometers.

42:43.570 --> 42:44.832
They're really great.

42:45.098 --> 42:49.624
I went around with them to auctions for years, and I helped them carry chests and things like that.

42:49.644 --> 42:51.887
Oh, so I think this is a genetic thing.

42:51.907 --> 42:52.928
Yeah.

42:52.948 --> 43:06.065
So when I came here, unlike some of my colleagues in my department who were art historians, that world of the cell room and the auction and collecting and dealing, how you price things, how you put a secret code.

43:06.085 --> 43:09.229
We don't put secret codes for prices on things, but I know what those are.

43:09.809 --> 43:14.295
And so that world was great for me to get into in terms of books.

43:14.984 --> 43:25.016
I had bought books before, but not on the scale we were buying, but here, and bidding at auctions was easy for me, because I had just trailed around with my father for years.

43:25.097 --> 43:25.877
I knew about that.

43:27.079 --> 43:32.165
And it was fun, you know, it was really fun.

43:32.185 --> 43:32.366
Oh, yeah.

43:32.386 --> 43:44.080
Well, at the time I was working with him, I was always wanting to leave, because he was always in the back of the sale room, you know, and I was wanting to get him out, you know, and he was always hanging around, talking to other people, you know.

43:44.448 --> 43:52.443
Of the 800,000 books, how many of those would you say are rare books, special collections?

43:52.463 --> 43:57.753
The rare book collection is over 40,000, but it goes from Renaissance.

43:57.914 --> 44:01.360
You know, there aren't many inclinables that are about art, so I think we have

44:02.015 --> 44:03.417
27 incunables.

44:03.837 --> 44:11.167
Someone always sachets it and says, well, I'm interested in seeing your incunables collection.

44:11.227 --> 44:16.054
We're not the Huntington Library.

44:16.655 --> 44:18.397
So that's not what we did.

44:18.477 --> 44:20.460
And it goes through artist books.

44:20.480 --> 44:25.046
So of that over 40,000, it's probably up to about 45,000.

44:25.106 --> 44:26.187
Temporary artist books?

44:26.207 --> 44:27.809
We have contemporary artist books as well.

44:27.829 --> 44:30.553
So you must be a very interesting place for these.

44:31.478 --> 44:44.774
Yeah, I'm careful to buy things that go with the collection, so we don't have great deep collections in the craft of artists' books, because other people collect those.

44:45.856 --> 44:49.380
We're always very aware of what UCLA is collecting, what's at USC.

44:50.461 --> 44:53.445
We could never compete with the Huntington Library.

44:53.465 --> 44:56.929
Mr. Huntington bought 200 libraries.

44:58.343 --> 44:59.925
That was an amazing time.

44:59.985 --> 45:02.809
And he did about a hundred years or so.

45:02.829 --> 45:04.231
Yeah, yeah.

45:04.772 --> 45:10.319
There were amazing things available when he and Pierpop Morgan and other people like that were buying libraries.

45:10.339 --> 45:12.542
We could never play that game.

45:12.562 --> 45:13.403
He built the entire library.

45:13.844 --> 45:14.104
Yeah.

45:15.246 --> 45:16.988
He collected collections, as you say.

45:17.088 --> 45:18.330
Yeah, yeah.

45:18.871 --> 45:21.635
We did that, but on a much smaller scale.

45:21.655 --> 45:24.218
You know, so we laid this basis for our collections.

45:24.659 --> 45:27.102
Some of the initial collections, not the Besterman collections,

45:27.470 --> 45:35.742
But we bought a collection on 18th century neoclassicism, because 18th century for art history is, this is when art history began.

45:36.363 --> 45:48.640
And it was the collection of Robert de Belder, one of these two brothers, his brother George, also collected botanical books, and there was a very famous sale of his.

45:49.421 --> 45:51.204
But this is Robert de Belder's collection.

45:51.644 --> 45:52.566
He had fragments.

45:52.646 --> 45:57.072
We didn't buy fragments, you know, and objets.

45:57.203 --> 45:59.508
He had regular books as well.

45:59.688 --> 46:02.735
So we had a library that added to our general collections.

46:02.755 --> 46:10.090
And sometimes we bought rare books along with a regular library and laid the basis for the collection.

46:10.110 --> 46:11.934
But pretty much they were discreet.

46:12.395 --> 46:13.899
So there was a rare book collection.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.406
The Muzio Architectural Library was mostly rare books.

46:17.892 --> 46:24.097
on the history of architecture, and Giovanni Muccio was an architect who used those books.

46:24.117 --> 46:28.501
So that was a way that we got a leg up and had a quick base of collections.

46:28.521 --> 46:32.004
But it was nothing like White de Huntington's did.

46:32.124 --> 46:33.766
I'm pretty respectful of that collection.

46:33.826 --> 46:35.627
Well, it's very different, but then you're different things.

46:35.807 --> 46:36.128
Yeah.

46:36.148 --> 46:38.029
You're embarking on a different program.

46:38.550 --> 46:46.937
He was also, he was a private collector, and so like Morgan and some of the other ones, or some of the other collections that based theirs on

46:47.170 --> 47:02.326
We were buying, we knew that we were going to be an open to the public institution that would support the museum, but we're also open to the world.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.467
From the beginning, too.

47:03.528 --> 47:04.669
Yes, we knew that.

47:08.152 --> 47:11.636
We bought at a breathtaking level.

47:11.836 --> 47:15.220
I have never been so busy as when I came here and worked.

47:15.537 --> 47:18.201
But who would not want to do this?

47:18.221 --> 47:28.116
It was an incredible privilege to have the money to build a superb we were buying for condition and completeness.

47:28.837 --> 47:35.767
We wanted good copies that had a kind of historical accuracy and so we valued original condition.

47:36.528 --> 47:38.271
And that was something people didn't understand because

47:38.707 --> 47:40.609
People would say, isn't that book kind of shabby?

47:40.629 --> 47:42.191
And I'd say, no, it's uncut.

47:42.211 --> 47:44.674
It's an original paper wrapper.

47:44.815 --> 47:47.378
No, no.

47:47.718 --> 47:55.688
We actually didn't want those sort of beautiful Morocco bindings from the 19th century with lovely pressed copies, because that taste has changed.

47:57.090 --> 47:57.290
True.

47:57.370 --> 48:00.574
Is your whole catalog in line?

48:00.935 --> 48:01.035
Yeah.

48:01.100 --> 48:04.204
So we can just go home and punch up and see what you have.

48:04.264 --> 48:08.570
Yeah, except for things that have just come in the door, you know, collections that were currently processing.

48:08.591 --> 48:17.884
And that was the other thing is we didn't have to convert a catalog to an electronic format.

48:18.645 --> 48:21.989
We had a small catalog, but it wasn't very substantial.

48:22.009 --> 48:24.413
You had to go through this big retrospective conversion.

48:25.654 --> 48:31.022
What we did was we funded, the Getty Trust funded,

48:31.694 --> 48:37.642
projects for UCLA, for New Public Library, Michigan.

48:38.023 --> 48:45.253
We had good art libraries, and then we could use those cataloging records to do that.

48:45.273 --> 48:53.644
Chris, in less than 20 years, material that encourages... Probably.

48:53.664 --> 48:56.047
Yeah, probably.

48:56.148 --> 48:57.249
Oh, yeah.

48:57.569 --> 49:00.874
Yeah, yeah.

49:01.698 --> 49:03.741
Yeah, yeah.

49:03.761 --> 49:10.072
The good stuff isn't around anymore, that's really true.

49:10.092 --> 49:10.212
Right.

49:10.232 --> 49:10.452
Yeah, yeah.

49:10.472 --> 49:13.678
The good stuff—and look at this—are you going over fear?

49:13.978 --> 49:14.339
Oh, yeah.

49:14.439 --> 49:15.901
Oh, you've got to go over fear.

49:15.941 --> 49:16.262
Oh, yeah.

49:16.402 --> 49:18.205
I'm heading right out, yeah.

49:20.547 --> 49:43.669
With the internet, does that change the interaction with the US?

49:44.459 --> 49:48.584
I don't use the internet except for pricing.

49:49.045 --> 49:50.387
That is amazing.

49:50.727 --> 49:51.388
And rarity.

49:52.049 --> 49:55.453
Because if you punch something in... Books aren't as rare as you thought.

49:55.473 --> 49:56.895
Yeah, it's really interesting.

49:58.578 --> 50:01.381
Because we mostly get everything on approval.

50:02.222 --> 50:11.074
Because I'm just a hound of condition and I've trained the other curators to be that way about books, to really look for that.

50:11.273 --> 50:16.621
It's hard to buy on the Internet in that way.

50:17.442 --> 50:34.967
But just the ability, just all those online catalogues, the Research Libraries Group, Arlen, OCLC, to be able to see how many copies of books are out there, you know, to get a kind of rough estimate.

50:35.007 --> 50:38.732
When they worked on the ISTC, the Incutable Short Title Catalogues,

50:39.151 --> 50:41.835
Well, I realized how many copies of Incunibulls were around.

50:41.995 --> 50:43.358
How many of Nuremberg?

50:43.378 --> 50:43.638
What is that?

50:43.678 --> 50:47.103
Yeah, it's the Incunibull short title catalog.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.188
And that's in Arlen now.

50:50.649 --> 50:54.315
But there are hundreds of copies of the Nuremberg article.

50:54.335 --> 50:56.057
What were they doing in Nuremberg?

50:56.077 --> 51:00.905
You know, putting out, you know, sort of preliminary.

51:00.945 --> 51:03.008
Can anyone go on to that IACC?

51:03.088 --> 51:06.694
Well, it's part of Arlen now, so you can just subscribe to Arlen and get in.

51:07.636 --> 51:08.117
Yes.

51:08.157 --> 51:10.619
Oh, I know you can, yeah.

51:10.739 --> 51:11.921
Yeah.

51:12.481 --> 51:16.406
I went up there to use their American Book Crisis comic, the CD.

51:16.426 --> 51:20.050
I did a little idea with Kathy Green from the book, too.

51:20.070 --> 51:21.452
She's fascinating.

51:21.472 --> 51:21.852
You know Kathy?

51:21.992 --> 51:24.114
Yes, yes, yes.

51:24.135 --> 51:27.458
She was out here as an advisor for The World From Here.

51:27.478 --> 51:29.020
You know, did you get copies?

51:29.881 --> 51:30.902
Of the devices of one?

51:30.922 --> 51:32.604
Yeah, we have more of those.

51:32.684 --> 51:34.386
And what about The World From Here?

51:34.535 --> 51:38.700
The catalog, the one that was at the Hammer that's closed?

51:38.720 --> 51:41.924
No, no, I'm going to buy one of those in the bookstore, actually.

51:42.004 --> 51:45.509
I don't have that.

51:45.589 --> 51:48.092
I'm happy to give you that.

51:48.252 --> 51:49.334
We have a copy.

51:49.354 --> 51:50.255
I can make a present.

51:50.395 --> 51:51.476
Would you like that?

51:51.496 --> 51:57.243
If only I can reciprocate with a present to you, I'll have to give it to you, but I'll take it on that.

51:57.283 --> 52:02.550
No, we have one thing to give to people who are particularly invested in the world of books,

52:02.834 --> 52:04.616
We had 80 books in that show.

52:05.558 --> 52:09.463
And I wrote some of the captions along with Bruce Whiteman and things like that.

52:09.823 --> 52:13.608
So it's a great catalog about libraries in Los Angeles.

52:14.289 --> 52:15.190
Somewhere there's a box.

52:15.210 --> 52:17.433
I think it's out there because I couldn't take all the boxes.

52:18.795 --> 52:22.640
That's the exhibition we wanted to see when we were out here.

52:22.660 --> 52:27.607
It was a really nice thing and it was very west coast because we had a lot of Asian books in there.

52:28.187 --> 52:32.453
So we were trying to really slant it to the world of the film industry.

52:33.007 --> 52:42.380
to the settlement of Los Angeles, the kind of things, big movie posters that are collected by institutions here.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.361
That's very interesting.

52:43.481 --> 52:49.670
If you find, is there kind of like an expatriate library attitude type of thing that you see?

52:49.690 --> 52:56.199
I mean, is there other Asian libraries here that might be the people of some Asian libraries in Asia, you know?

52:56.379 --> 52:56.840
I don't know.

52:57.100 --> 52:59.443
We're just beginning, I'm just working on that.

52:59.483 --> 53:02.187
My next exhibition I'm going to do after this is on China.

53:02.538 --> 53:13.248
And we've collected these books that are just bridging Europe and China and that view things produced in China, things produced in the West about China, putting them together.

53:13.828 --> 53:15.050
We're just working on that.

53:15.090 --> 53:31.785
Though one of our curators, the bibliographer, the person who is in charge of the general collections, just produced a position paper working with the UCLA, the Richard Rudolph Library, which is a very estimable Chinese-Japanese collection.

53:32.440 --> 53:35.905
And we're working on where we're going to go in terms of that.

53:35.925 --> 53:41.754
But there are very strong Asian collections, and so there were wonderful things in the world from here on.

53:43.076 --> 53:47.723
Chinese books, they have an amazing tradition that's much longer than ours.

53:47.983 --> 53:50.667
The first printed book is, what, the Diamond Sousa or something?

53:50.687 --> 53:51.629
Yes, yes.

53:51.709 --> 53:53.391
400 years, it speaks Gutenberg.

53:53.412 --> 53:55.855
Not with metal, but never the last printed book.

53:55.875 --> 53:57.117
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:57.137 --> 54:01.063
But you can use lots of different techniques to produce lots of different formats.

54:01.837 --> 54:14.529
And we're changing our formats right now for book production, so I wouldn't want to—although I'm very interested in books and printing myself, I would never want to say that's the only format that's important.

54:15.570 --> 54:21.496
One of the chapters in this next book is in all the different surfaces that we've recorded at Five Sines.

54:21.516 --> 54:23.117
Can you tell me something about that?

54:23.137 --> 54:25.880
Can we kind of turn you off for a while and let you talk about that?

54:26.040 --> 54:27.261
I'm kind of interested in that.

54:27.802 --> 54:30.004
That particular subject?

54:31.621 --> 54:43.778
We've had this kind of acrimonious interchanges because the things haven't been well described.

54:44.680 --> 54:50.468
And I had wonderful experience last week as I went to Christie's in New York.

54:50.488 --> 54:58.079
I thought we were going to bid on one of these 18th century auction catalogs by famous French collectors.

54:58.099 --> 55:01.223
There were these people, Mariette, Crozat, Rémy.

55:01.608 --> 55:04.651
And they were principals in auctions.

55:04.771 --> 55:06.133
They sold their own collections.

55:06.233 --> 55:07.694
They bought other people's collections.

55:08.295 --> 55:16.363
And the auction catalogs from that time, it's sort of mid to end of the 18th, maybe 1720s on.

55:16.463 --> 55:20.327
And it really documents very interesting collecting practices.

55:20.728 --> 55:26.233
This was a print catalog, a catalog of Quazat's print collection.

55:26.253 --> 55:29.016
And it supposedly was illustrated

55:29.283 --> 55:42.743
by these little tiny vignettes that this artist, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin, had put in the margins and they showed the paintings and the drawings that were offered for sale in the catalogs.

55:42.763 --> 55:45.627
They were collector's objects since the 18th century.

55:46.128 --> 55:57.585
And this was purportedly a catalog of one of the collectors and auctioneers, Pierre Rémy, illustrated by Saint-Aubin.

55:57.920 --> 56:10.896
As you were reading this, we realized that they had been cut out and put in the Oakland catalogs, so we thought that's very interesting that it's not like the other catalogs, which are just, you know, have marginal vignettes on the page.

56:11.557 --> 56:17.584
And then as I worked on it, I realized this thing has been put together, and the things that were by St.

56:17.624 --> 56:21.409
O'Bend didn't correspond to the entries in the sales catalogs.

56:21.429 --> 56:27.336
In fact, we didn't know what they were, but they were taken from another catalog because they had little catch numbers on them.

56:27.940 --> 56:28.922
Yeah.

56:28.942 --> 56:38.378
And then, when they said that it had been annotated by Pierre Grenier, there was no evidence whatsoever in this catalog that they were buying him.

56:38.398 --> 56:42.906
They were hypothesizing because he wasn't mentioned as one of the buyers.

56:43.106 --> 56:44.609
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

56:44.629 --> 56:45.390
It's interesting.

56:45.410 --> 56:45.610
Yes.

56:46.492 --> 56:48.295
And then...

56:48.865 --> 56:51.929
And from that, we looked at the location.

56:52.069 --> 56:57.977
No, it was somebody new, and he was a very interesting guy.

56:58.118 --> 56:59.900
I don't want to get into it.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.325
Oh, I'm going to get into it.

57:03.385 --> 57:06.730
But he had described it in, you know, the best possible way.

57:06.850 --> 57:10.755
In fact, I think it was kind of put together in the 19th century.

57:11.393 --> 57:25.089
by a collector who wanted to mimic these catalogs that had been done in the 18th century, because the binding was 19th century, and the whole thing had a kind of 19th century look to it.

57:25.109 --> 57:26.851
This is one of the original catalogs.

57:26.871 --> 57:31.957
It's a bad draft copy, but this is what the catalogs really should have looked like.

57:32.718 --> 57:34.660
Even the writings look 19th century.

57:34.720 --> 57:39.105
We had the information in our copies of the sale catalogs that we have already.

57:39.372 --> 57:42.601
We had the buyer and we had the price, so we really had that information.

57:43.202 --> 57:48.116
There were a couple annotations that commented on the taste of a particular work.

57:48.777 --> 57:50.402
They weren't interesting.

57:50.422 --> 57:54.192
And so to go and look at this thing, which is what that is,

57:54.610 --> 58:00.417
And then we went the next day to these, they turned out with the Morgan, and we looked at the real things, and we looked at the quality of the drawings.

58:00.938 --> 58:05.763
Even the quality of the drawings, they were blurred, they were ripped in some cases.

58:05.784 --> 58:07.446
You couldn't really see it.

58:07.466 --> 58:12.251
This beautiful picture of Los Angeles that they showed is wisdom.

58:12.392 --> 58:18.158
In the catalog, it didn't even seem to be like they were at the center bed, so that was awful.

58:18.499 --> 58:20.381
I'm looking at your notes here, you really did.

58:20.401 --> 58:22.744
Oh, it was really fun, because I was working with a dealer,

58:23.011 --> 58:32.185
And then the next year we went to the Morgan and we realized, oh, wait a minute, these things in this catalog hardly look like it, plus the book is problematic.

58:32.205 --> 58:33.027
So we didn't bid on it.

58:33.347 --> 58:36.332
But I went to the auction, you know, how could I not go to the auction after that?

58:36.352 --> 58:37.694
I was growing up time anyway.

58:38.455 --> 58:46.989
And it's sold for $80,000 to the end.

58:47.449 --> 58:49.693
And maybe they knew something.

58:49.977 --> 58:52.741
I wouldn't touch this thing because I didn't know it.

58:52.821 --> 58:59.351
And then the dealer that I worked with, he just went and met me because he had seen it once and then we were meeting with Christine to really go through it.

58:59.731 --> 59:00.753
And it was fun to go through it.

59:00.853 --> 59:01.875
You know, he read the whole thing.

59:01.895 --> 59:04.318
So it was very, you know, very educational.

59:05.059 --> 59:08.324
And he said, he said, this thing has red flags all over it.

59:08.885 --> 59:11.669
And it did.

59:11.689 --> 59:11.749
So.

59:12.067 --> 59:15.892
And so it was so much fun.

59:15.932 --> 59:16.873
Who was the underbid?

59:16.933 --> 59:19.216
You know, the bidding was very spirited.

59:19.236 --> 59:21.719
I just stood at the back of the room and died.

59:21.840 --> 59:24.403
I just thought, have these people really looked at this thing?

59:24.423 --> 59:25.344
And this was 20 to 30.

59:25.364 --> 59:28.108
So it tripled the estimate.

59:28.128 --> 59:30.751
And we were prepared to go a certain way on it.

59:30.951 --> 59:33.515
So you might have brought it if the price was right.

59:33.535 --> 59:38.621
Well, if the thing was okay, though, but as soon as we looked at it, we looked at it.

59:38.681 --> 59:41.685
And what I thought was maybe everybody else would think that.

59:42.239 --> 59:45.303
And we would go back and maybe it would be bought in and we could get it.

59:45.763 --> 59:49.828
But because we didn't know what it was, and maybe there was something that VN knew.

59:49.888 --> 59:51.049
Maybe they knew what this was.

59:51.590 --> 59:55.434
But if I don't know what it is... I'm curious to find out.

59:55.454 --> 59:58.258
Oh my goodness, I'm buying her institution.

59:58.278 --> 01:00:00.060
You know, it's too scary.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.444
And the dealer agreed was that this was way too scary.

01:00:03.464 --> 01:00:10.812
But it was fascinating because it was some kind of object that someone had made to look like a center back catalog.

01:00:10.994 --> 01:00:12.856
But it was, oh, it was really fun.

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:14.357
But I like auctions.

01:00:14.457 --> 01:00:22.325
I mean, I like these 18th century auctions, because this is sort of the, you know, the heart of when auction sales really get going.

01:00:22.345 --> 01:00:25.288
Do you find that catalogs have kind of declined in quality?

01:00:25.328 --> 01:00:28.651
What do you think of the internet?

01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:32.595
That where they still do printed catalogs is still very good.

01:00:32.615 --> 01:00:34.217
You know, it really depends.

01:00:34.237 --> 01:00:36.499
There have been some book catalogs.

01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:40.663
Hope Mayo did one for how much?

01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:52.757
That was an amazing catalogue that you would use as a reference book.

01:00:53.499 --> 01:00:56.964
I use the Blackmer collection catalogue all the time.

01:00:56.984 --> 01:01:01.311
So some of them are works of high scholarship and become reference books.

01:01:01.331 --> 01:01:05.318
Other ones, it's what the buyer beware.

01:01:05.602 --> 01:01:07.606
in a drawing scale.

01:01:07.626 --> 01:01:09.530
That was very interesting to me.

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:16.524
So you would have drawings kind of served, but you wouldn't have people knew about books.

01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:18.328
So, you know, Christian people, they're not dumb.
