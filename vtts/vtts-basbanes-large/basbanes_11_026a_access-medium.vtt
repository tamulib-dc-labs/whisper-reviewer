WEBVTT

00:07.203 --> 00:14.093
Test 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:14.213 --> 00:15.836
I'm Caroline Filovich.

00:15.856 --> 00:18.159
I'm the visiting campus librarian.

00:18.179 --> 00:18.940
How do you spell your lesson?

00:19.841 --> 00:20.022
S-Z-Y.

00:20.302 --> 00:20.602
S-Z?

00:20.623 --> 00:20.983
Yes.

00:21.664 --> 00:24.989
Y-L-O-W-I-C-E.

00:25.770 --> 00:26.171
Okay.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.515
And visiting campus librarian.

00:29.716 --> 00:31.979
So this is a whole division, a department here?

00:31.999 --> 00:35.404
Well, it's a unit that depends on the mother of the campus library.

00:36.177 --> 00:39.783
And how many items did he acquire over the years?

00:40.244 --> 00:40.465
Yes.

00:40.645 --> 00:44.832
In terms of books about Proust, he had about 2,000 volumes here.

00:46.495 --> 00:47.718
And these are books that he acquired?

00:47.898 --> 00:49.761
Well, or that he made the library acquire.

00:50.723 --> 00:52.626
That he or the library.

00:52.847 --> 00:59.198
Some of these books are his personal belongings and some belongs to the library.

00:59.718 --> 01:06.748
Again, because Proust never dated his letters, he might put in Wednesday... Wednesday night, or... Did his handwriting change over the years?

01:06.788 --> 01:08.590
Was he able to... Yeah.

01:08.791 --> 01:13.758
So, as a young man, Proust was... Now then, he had very careful... He must have been.

01:13.918 --> 01:16.542
What a job that must have been, just to try and sort this out.

01:16.562 --> 01:19.786
I mean, obviously, he had to figure it out from context, I guess, what was going on.

01:20.567 --> 01:23.411
Well, this is the whole idea behind the index cards.

01:23.431 --> 01:28.999
He kept all kinds of information on his index cards, by category, by names of people.

01:29.418 --> 01:34.266
by titles of works, by places.

01:34.286 --> 01:35.889
There's a chronological file.

01:35.909 --> 01:41.037
Well, all kinds of things that happened, both in Cruz's life and in other people's lives.

01:41.438 --> 01:43.281
Are these basically his files?

01:44.022 --> 01:46.846
No, those are actually microfilms with the newspapers of the period.

01:46.967 --> 01:47.087
I see.

01:47.908 --> 01:51.474
These are his files.

01:51.734 --> 01:56.522
Yes, this is part of the chronology of all the events that happened during Cruz's life.

01:57.093 --> 01:58.875
And did he have someone type these for him?

01:58.895 --> 02:01.237
Well, he needed a computer.

02:01.778 --> 02:03.520
Although, yeah, he did.

02:03.540 --> 02:15.992
Well, that's interesting that you said that because that is the whole point of this project that we have now is a couple of professors decided he's got this thing with these index cards that's essentially a database on paper.

02:16.753 --> 02:25.682
And why don't we put it on the computer and not just on the computer here but on the internet so that anybody in the world can actually

02:25.966 --> 02:28.388
sort of come here and search through these documents.

02:28.408 --> 02:29.289
And search his database.

02:29.790 --> 02:30.370
Right, right.

02:30.390 --> 02:31.211
So that's what you're doing.

02:31.251 --> 02:31.792
That's what we're doing.

02:31.812 --> 02:33.934
How many cards approximately would you say you have?

02:34.014 --> 02:35.455
We estimated about 40,000.

02:35.475 --> 02:37.157
40,000 cards.

02:38.238 --> 02:39.760
I didn't get your name for the machine.

02:39.780 --> 02:40.180
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.441
I'm Patrick Reidenbaugh.

02:41.642 --> 02:43.423
You have to spell your last name.

02:43.544 --> 02:48.488
It's R-E-I-V-E-N-B-A-U-G-H.

02:49.770 --> 02:55.095
I'm a visiting research associate this year at the university.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.570
So you're a student?

02:57.590 --> 03:04.681
Well, I was a student, but now I've graduated, so now I'm not a tenured faculty member, so I'm visiting, you know, visiting research.

03:04.701 --> 03:06.264
So you're working on the collection?

03:06.705 --> 03:08.147
Yeah, this is my job here.

03:08.167 --> 03:14.637
So you're putting on the Internet the database, this early database, before we even had that phrase.

03:14.802 --> 03:17.426
And also, are you scanning the letters as well?

03:17.486 --> 03:18.628
Are you making the letters?

03:19.029 --> 03:20.011
We would like to do that.

03:20.051 --> 03:27.523
First, we would like to have the text of the letters digitized as well, because it's the source of all its files.

03:27.543 --> 03:33.213
And then also, we would like to scan at least the letters we have in the record.

03:33.233 --> 03:36.338
So you're going to scan the contents of those volumes then?

03:36.358 --> 03:37.219
Is that what I...?

03:38.041 --> 03:40.084
Well, actually, we're thinking that

03:40.739 --> 03:46.426
Probably with the present state of scanning technology and the quality of the volumes, it's actually... We need to, yeah.

03:46.446 --> 03:50.131
Well, someone would actually have to type, retype 21 volumes.

03:50.371 --> 03:54.637
There are overseas companies that do that.

03:54.657 --> 03:56.058
Too bad they don't have any disks.

03:56.799 --> 03:57.580
Right, right.

03:58.762 --> 03:59.783
They don't, apparently.

03:59.803 --> 04:00.604
The publisher.

04:00.820 --> 04:16.753
so really what's going online then is basically his is the professor's data we're starting with his his notes right and then we would like to have the letters themselves obviously because that's what everything relates to but we haven't started that part yet

04:17.155 --> 04:19.478
And what is the microfilm?

04:19.698 --> 04:32.236
Are these the letters that he... No, the microfilms are all the newspapers that proofs to read the nature of newspapers of the South, so he has been forwarded at 1888 to 1922 when he died.

04:32.516 --> 04:37.463
I'm going to ask you to do one thing for me.

04:39.025 --> 04:42.550
We were reading from where he talked about the tapestry.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.192
Oh, did you think this was the...

04:44.392 --> 04:47.235
Just a little bit, just to tell me a little bit.

04:47.255 --> 04:49.077
We'll translate it together.

04:49.097 --> 04:50.178
Where is it?

04:50.239 --> 04:53.522
And this is what we call the avant-propos.

04:53.542 --> 04:54.063
Forward.

04:54.123 --> 04:54.944
Okay, forward.

04:56.305 --> 04:57.487
And this is to the volume one.

04:59.028 --> 05:03.313
And so what she's telling you here, the letters of Marcel Proust.

05:04.775 --> 05:07.598
If compared to Proust's novels,

05:09.788 --> 05:14.315
You can do it very loosely.

05:14.395 --> 05:17.740
It doesn't have to be a direct thread.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.586
You can't really say the letters resemble him.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.533
You don't have to do toots too literally.

05:25.633 --> 05:34.226
Oh, maybe reflect something.

05:36.009 --> 05:37.872
Reflect him.

05:38.543 --> 05:59.691
in the same way that the reverse side of a tapestry resembles the front.

06:04.718 --> 06:05.619
And what does he mean by that?

06:06.921 --> 06:07.842
Well, all that

06:08.648 --> 06:10.471
Okay, so after, does he explain?

06:10.632 --> 06:10.952
Yes.

06:10.972 --> 06:14.539
You can distinguish all the threads, all the colors.

06:18.305 --> 06:20.069
That's good.

06:20.089 --> 06:27.702
What's missing is... So what's missing is the clearness of the pattern, because when you're looking at the back, right?

06:28.163 --> 06:28.564
That's good.

06:33.016 --> 06:34.758
It's a good translation of mine.

06:35.299 --> 06:47.273
It's saying in the letters of Proust where you find everything that you put in his work, but in less poetic ways.

06:47.353 --> 06:48.174
How many letters again?

06:48.195 --> 06:48.955
Did you tell me?

06:49.156 --> 06:50.597
About 5,000 are published.

06:52.580 --> 07:00.930
But the rare book room here at the University of Illinois that has... 700 original letters.

07:01.231 --> 07:05.737
Well, the library requires a direction of Keith Goldberg.

07:05.757 --> 07:05.877
Right.

07:05.937 --> 07:08.341
On his incentive, I guess.

07:08.361 --> 07:15.130
So, out here in the middle of Illinois, we have a major archive of French literature.

07:15.170 --> 07:20.978
We're guessing that we have as many, or perhaps more, than the Bibliotech National.

07:23.354 --> 07:25.358
I doubt they'd let these letters out of France now.

07:26.059 --> 07:26.660
Oh, they do.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.021
They do?

07:27.221 --> 07:27.481
Yeah.

07:27.501 --> 07:28.243
They still do?

07:28.263 --> 07:30.687
Well, yeah, the libraries require them.

07:30.747 --> 07:31.749
If you can afford them.

07:31.889 --> 07:35.275
Pay them, yes.

07:35.295 --> 07:38.020
And we know there are still many unproduced.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.308
Colt, of course, got them in large groups when they were not so expensive years ago.

07:42.811 --> 07:51.002
The first major set of letters used from the print, letters of proofs to the print Bibesco, one of the good friends.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.283
That's about 220 letters.

07:52.384 --> 07:52.664
Wow.

07:52.964 --> 07:57.450
That's the library required for $5,000 that was in 1951 or 52.

07:58.472 --> 08:01.876
Nowadays, one letter costs more than $5,000.

08:01.896 --> 08:02.857
And who were they written to?

08:02.877 --> 08:04.039
They were written to him?

08:04.059 --> 08:04.820
Prince Antoine Bibesco.

08:05.080 --> 08:05.701
Prince?

08:05.721 --> 08:06.462
Prince Bibesco.

08:07.203 --> 08:12.210
B-I-B-E-S-E-O.

08:12.230 --> 08:12.430
That's it.

08:13.102 --> 08:15.245
This is great.

08:15.465 --> 08:16.707
Oh, we have a website.

08:16.727 --> 08:17.368
Okay, yeah.

08:17.388 --> 08:21.334
Yeah, you might want to look at that because that's sort of the heart of the project.

08:21.494 --> 08:23.637
But I guess we don't have time for it today.

08:23.737 --> 08:30.046
I can do it at home.

08:30.927 --> 08:38.738
At the moment, we have a collection of 1,327 bibliographic entries that you can consult on the Internet.

08:39.005 --> 08:44.310
But soon, we're going to put on a selection from the chronological file of Proust's life.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.673
We'll probably put on initially about $2,000.

08:46.693 --> 08:50.697
You're going to put on a little biographical blurb about Professor Cole?

08:50.717 --> 08:51.518
Oh, it's all there.

08:51.718 --> 08:52.639
So everything I need is there.

08:52.779 --> 08:59.006
Well, you can spend, if you read all the documents on the website, you can probably spend a couple hours.

08:59.146 --> 09:00.928
Oh, that's fine.

09:00.948 --> 09:01.088
Yeah.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.950
Great.

09:02.970 --> 09:03.490
All right.

09:03.550 --> 09:06.794
Yeah, good.

09:07.554 --> 09:07.815
Thanks a lot.

09:07.835 --> 09:08.235
Thank you very much.

09:08.806 --> 09:37.287
Great.

09:37.307 --> 09:37.487
Next one.

09:37.507 --> 09:37.787
See you later.

09:37.807 --> 09:38.068
Are you okay?

09:38.088 --> 09:38.188
Yeah.

09:39.535 --> 09:54.002
Oh, I love facts.

09:54.022 --> 10:00.193
I've got to give you something to say.

10:01.456 --> 10:08.789
Let's start again.

10:09.089 --> 10:27.160
We're talking to, let's get your name.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.352
And the clarity is better than the bigger ones.

10:30.432 --> 10:34.918
So your name, full name, how do you like to see it in print?

10:34.998 --> 10:38.363
I guess you know it.

10:38.383 --> 10:38.583
Okay.

10:38.603 --> 10:39.364
My name is Beth Sandor.

10:39.384 --> 10:39.705
Beth Sandor.

10:39.725 --> 10:40.766
Is it Elizabeth or Beth?

10:40.786 --> 10:41.067
Beth.

10:41.667 --> 10:48.777
Beth Sandor and I'm the coordinator for the digital imaging initiative in the university library.

10:49.246 --> 11:13.409
And the goal of the Digital Imaging Initiative has been to work with library collections and faculty and the user community to provide broader access to visual information and to .

11:13.429 --> 11:13.849
Am I registering?

11:14.810 --> 11:16.672
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:16.692 --> 11:18.173
This is fine, I guess.

11:18.473 --> 11:39.478
So really our goal of the image initiative is twofold, to provide broader access to fragile and underutilized visual information, and in cases where it is appropriate, to use digitizing as a means of preserving information that can't be preserved in other ways.

11:40.339 --> 11:43.883
And I can give you a pretty good statement.

11:43.963 --> 11:46.126
Okay, and I'd like one.

11:46.406 --> 11:46.506
Okay.

11:46.486 --> 11:53.697
The reliability of preserving digital material is under question.

11:53.957 --> 11:55.900
It is.

12:00.227 --> 12:04.714
It is under question.

12:05.335 --> 12:15.353
It's very clear that digital images are widely used by the Internet community, and the Internet community is growing.

12:16.335 --> 12:21.825
However, standards and file formats

12:21.805 --> 12:38.877
and digitizing procedures, especially for visual information, are not well explored and they simply are not standardized.

12:38.897 --> 12:45.028
Things are too fluid right now with the technology, the standards, and our understanding of how all those things need to come together so that we can capture something that's fragile once

12:45.008 --> 12:54.221
at a very high resolution and not disturb it again to do the same kind of process.

12:54.241 --> 13:05.717
Say in five years when we have these marvelous flat panel HDTV quality displays and we realize that the image that we captured five years ago just isn't good enough to display.

13:05.697 --> 13:16.136
So yes, things are fluid.

13:16.156 --> 13:17.759
That's why we concentrate on access.

13:18.200 --> 13:28.018
And we do have one project where we're working with a collection of aerial photography, which documents the land use history of the state of Illinois from the 30s through the 90s.

13:28.038 --> 13:29.781
That collection had a set of archival on the hill

13:29.761 --> 13:40.635
However, they were unstable filling from the area, and they were systematically destroyed in the 80s because they were combustion.

13:40.955 --> 13:41.636
Where was it?

13:41.656 --> 13:43.058
Where was it?

13:43.078 --> 13:44.961
Here in the background.

13:44.981 --> 13:46.503
But this was fairly common.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.926
How many fillings were these?

13:48.946 --> 13:56.055
Well, the collection has over 60,000 aerial photographs

13:56.407 --> 14:00.691
that span a period from 1930s to the mid-50s.

14:00.932 --> 14:05.076
And that's part of the collection that we're working on.

14:05.216 --> 14:14.826
Because for that group of 60,000-odd photographers, the archival film negatives had to be destroyed because they were an unstable film media.

14:15.727 --> 14:17.969
All we have is the paper photographs.

14:17.989 --> 14:20.552
So you think you still have the original photos?

14:21.292 --> 14:22.433
We have the photos.

14:22.453 --> 14:24.996
But these photos are used on the average of 2,000 times a month.

14:25.297 --> 14:34.911
by people who want to analyze land use for various purposes, engineering and surveying some of them.

14:34.932 --> 14:37.235
You mean the art, the art photo itself?

14:37.255 --> 14:38.958
No, the photo itself is used.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.922
So we started to digitize the photo,

14:42.307 --> 14:56.483
Because what we found through experimentation is if you take a picture of that picture, you've already lost 10% of the quality, the visual quality of the picture that you're looking at.

14:56.503 --> 15:06.675
So we worked with a corporate partner, a scanning and graphics company in town.

15:07.856 --> 15:09.478
Their name is Scantex Color Systems.

15:09.847 --> 15:35.668
We worked with this company for a period of at least a year to develop the best approach to digitizing, scanning these photographs, and capturing the optimal amount of information from the photograph without making it a cost-prohibitive scanning activity.

15:35.648 --> 15:50.816
So we're in the process of requesting funding to digitize all 60,000 languages.

15:50.836 --> 15:54.282
We digitized about 300 and we have support from the Illinois State Library to digitize several hundred more.

15:54.262 --> 16:14.060
We have also, in addition to that, and this is something that I'm thinking about in preparing for your visit today, one of the important parts, components of digitizing is access, organizing or arranging access.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.945
I always use the example of the pictures in a shoebox.

16:16.925 --> 16:32.790
Once you get more than a couple hundred, you've got to have a way of organizing and that's got to remain consistent no matter what types of materials you digitize or what topics you're working on.

16:32.770 --> 16:44.961
500 people who want to use that image, but they might all be looking for it in different ways.

16:44.982 --> 16:57.774
So the methods of describing that image need to be made consistent, and the systems that we developed to provide access to those images need to speak to a member of different types of users who might be community-dazing.

16:57.794 --> 16:59.335
So one of the things that we worked on with the aerial photographs was

16:59.686 --> 17:03.450
These pictures are not part of our collection, but they're pretty nice.

17:03.590 --> 17:08.876
Is this the Getty site or is this the other site?

17:08.936 --> 17:13.962
This is our site, and I'll get to this in just a second.

17:13.982 --> 17:22.251
What we've done with the aerial photograph project, as you'll see with a couple of projects we've done, is to digitize the images.

17:22.231 --> 17:42.231
work out standardized ways of indexing or describing them and build interfaces and retrieval mechanisms that will allow people to get to have those images by either searching for a keyword or an artist or a creator.

17:42.211 --> 17:48.662
or maybe a state or a country where that was created.

17:48.682 --> 17:58.599
We think that it's equally important to work on the methods of access as well as the methods of scanning.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.222
So I should show you a few.

18:00.322 --> 18:01.104
Okay, great.

18:01.124 --> 18:02.987
These won't go down on tape.

18:02.967 --> 18:11.185
The other thing I thought of while I was thinking about this was if there's a passage in a book written by A.S.

18:11.205 --> 18:21.027
Byatt, Possession and Romance, and this is early on in the book when the Haggai, I can't remember his name,

18:21.715 --> 18:38.411
finds the letter, finds Ash's letter in one of Ash's books.

18:38.431 --> 18:47.520
And there's a whole passage where he describes sitting in the reading room where he is and the smell and the touch and the feel and the look of the work that he's using and just this sense of wonder that he's looking at both of them

18:47.500 --> 19:02.468
the poet's actual notes, and then he discovers this letter.

19:02.488 --> 19:02.709
Fold it up.

19:02.729 --> 19:03.370
Nobody's ever discovered it.

19:03.390 --> 19:05.935
It's not inventory in the collection.

19:05.955 --> 19:06.496
All of a sudden, it's here.

19:06.516 --> 19:07.618
And that's the one thing that

19:08.307 --> 19:15.638
Digitizing can't recreate that experience of discovering something, being in a whole environment.

19:16.899 --> 19:20.765
I think we're at least a few years old.

19:20.785 --> 19:33.383
But I thought about that a lot because many people get quite enamored of technology and we focus on the point that what it does is it helps you provide greater access to things.

19:33.623 --> 19:36.087
It doesn't recreate the whole atmosphere

19:36.067 --> 19:56.421
of holding or looking at the original image just so i can get back and get this at home right you can yeah in fact i've got an info sheet for you that describes our project this is a project that we developed in conjunction with the getty information institute and several local historical societies and their university archives

19:56.401 --> 20:08.298
We wanted to start working on putting together virtual collections of materials that are physically in different collections, but treat similar topics and themes.

20:09.139 --> 20:12.584
So we did... Oh, make one synergistic kind of a collection?

20:12.744 --> 20:12.945
Right.

20:13.005 --> 20:20.535
Available at one site, but drawn from... Drawn from different physical applications.

20:20.615 --> 20:24.501
So we worked with the University Archives,

20:25.544 --> 20:37.760
the Champaign County Historical Archives, and another special collection in the Communications Library of Magazine Tearsheet Ads.

20:37.780 --> 20:47.113
And we digitized about 300 images from those collections that dealt with the past 50 years of history in Champaign County.

20:47.330 --> 20:59.787
And we used the framework to put these together based on a book written by Fernand Browdell, The Structures of Everyday Life.

20:59.907 --> 21:11.042
And you can see that these categories don't correspond completely to Browdell's categories because Browdell was writing a little bit earlier than we started thinking about it.

21:11.022 --> 21:33.604
But we wanted to have a database that was visually navigable, where someone could look at visual cues and get an idea that they wanted to find things about communication, and communication might mean any of these kinds of things, and if they wanted to narrow that by a particular time period, they could even do that.

21:34.715 --> 21:42.107
We wanted to make this database easy to get into, easy to search.

21:43.329 --> 21:51.503
This is a poster that was created in the 70s, right after Kemp State.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.787
And this was a protest.

21:53.767 --> 22:00.414
a protest against the development of one of the ILLIAC series computers on campus.

22:01.695 --> 22:10.265
ALBA had fun at the university to develop this computer and there was so much unrest on campus that they moved the construction of the computer.

22:10.705 --> 22:15.130
I think that's where they found it.

22:15.150 --> 22:19.915
This is one of the posters that I think it was advertising.

22:19.935 --> 22:21.837
What's ILLIAC an acronym for?

22:21.857 --> 22:22.778
You have a money or something.

22:23.467 --> 22:46.909
So from that standpoint,

22:47.176 --> 22:58.537
It's a nice part.

22:58.557 --> 23:00.020
But then you have things under the same category that dealt with strikes.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.987
You also find the online farmer strike.

23:06.903 --> 23:08.385
Where were the images drawn from?

23:08.706 --> 23:12.933
These were drawn from, some were from the county historical archives.

23:13.193 --> 23:15.016
Yeah, we give credits right there.

23:16.238 --> 23:19.484
And this is a nice picture of the farmer strike in 1979.

23:20.926 --> 23:27.717
And these tractors actually drove all the way to Washington.

23:27.857 --> 23:31.223
It must have been coal too, that was in January.

23:33.346 --> 24:00.400
so in a sense we wanted to put together this type of database to get a better idea of what it would take to bring together different kinds of cultural heritage institutions different ways of describing information because we each have our own you know the library used the mark format museum's interesting and varied format archive used version of the mark format and phone name

24:00.380 --> 24:08.290
And as we move into the electronic image, those kinds of approaches to description are moving into electronic format.

24:08.310 --> 24:16.060
Now you mentioned earlier using digital procedures as a preservation tool.

24:16.080 --> 24:16.861
Right.

24:16.881 --> 24:19.885
And let me just give you a look at our aerial photograph archive.

24:19.905 --> 24:25.071
This is, as I mentioned before, a pilot project, and what we did was

24:25.270 --> 24:32.511
We took about 300 images from Will County, which is just the west of Chicago.

24:32.531 --> 24:34.918
We digitized them in conjunction with Scantec, our partner.

24:35.419 --> 24:39.752
We hand-indexed them, and then we

24:39.968 --> 24:46.222
worked with GIS service on campus to spatially anchor them to the earth.

24:46.463 --> 24:59.091
So, for instance, if I'm looking at an aerial photograph over Joliet, Illinois, that photograph is actually anchored in geographic space, so I know exactly where that would sit on that.

24:59.071 --> 25:26.458
And we wanted to blend our hand indexing with the geospatial indexing information so that when I search the Joliet quadrangle for Joliet municipal airport, I can pull a photogram of that area.

25:26.478 --> 25:29.061
I can see that I didn't find any photo that contained everything I asked for.

25:29.615 --> 25:37.105
But I can see that I found lots of photos that contain at least one of the things I have.

25:37.125 --> 25:43.073
And then I can see a low-resolution image of that photo and the text.

25:43.113 --> 25:44.935
But why are people using these photos?

25:44.955 --> 25:45.776
What's the use?

25:46.097 --> 25:48.981
Well, it runs all the way from personal use.

25:49.001 --> 25:58.373
Let's say Farmer Jones wants to see what his land looks like 50 years ago, or Farmer Jones' granddaughter would like to see what the land looks like.

25:58.437 --> 26:10.497
There might be somebody who's going to buy a piece of land who wants to determine whether there had been any hazardous waste dumping on it over the history of it.

26:10.517 --> 26:11.739
Very important photos.

26:11.759 --> 26:12.260
Absolutely.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.342
You can trace erosion.

26:14.183 --> 26:15.585
You can trace erosion.

26:15.726 --> 26:17.188
And prior to this, they had a care.

26:17.168 --> 26:22.258
They had to come down here to the map and geography library.

26:22.278 --> 26:29.613
They had to get some visual sense by looking at a large composite map of where they wanted to look.

26:30.214 --> 26:35.785
And then they had to write down that information for the librarian who pulled the individual photos.

26:35.866 --> 26:42.016
And now if you get this whole archive online, you can access it anywhere.

26:42.076 --> 26:42.396
Yes.

26:43.037 --> 26:57.440
In fact, the thing that you couldn't do, you cannot now do by hand in the map and geography library, what you can do online is to say, show me all photographs that have airports across the state of Illinois.

26:57.460 --> 27:00.625
When we have everything digitized, you'll be able to do that.

27:00.841 --> 27:15.345
So in a sense what we're doing in addition to the digitizing is increasing the availability of access.

27:17.508 --> 27:20.353
So Dr. Graham, nice to meet you.

27:22.035 --> 27:24.840
Now you go to Cornell and they

27:25.124 --> 27:29.571
Of course, they're using digitization as a scanning technique.

27:30.072 --> 27:36.001
They will take some old 19th century books that are out of copyright, so they can't be more recent than they get from.

27:37.723 --> 27:38.625
They make a copy.

27:39.286 --> 27:45.495
They also make a hard copy, but they may not always do that, but then they get rid of it.

27:46.589 --> 27:55.405
I won't even use the word the exception, they sent out to the landfill that book which has been stripped and sliced and diced and that's history.

27:55.426 --> 28:01.577
Now there's a problem, of course, we talk about the migration of the

28:01.709 --> 28:06.135
Do you keep everything in the original?

28:06.535 --> 28:21.895
At this point, yes, because our objective has been to capture high-fidelity digital images one time and not go back and disturb the original, and to be able to capture without destroying the original.

28:21.875 --> 28:38.610
Books are a slightly different story because they have to unbind and then in order to store one of them.

28:38.630 --> 28:42.077
We freed them from their finding.

28:42.344 --> 28:47.913
But our work is slightly different because we're focusing mainly on visual information.

28:48.975 --> 28:53.282
But that issue has come up a couple of times.

28:53.302 --> 29:08.267
We have, fortunately, digital technologies are developing so that, for instance, if I don't want to bend the binding of a book, if it fits it too tight,

29:08.247 --> 29:18.922
then I can use a digital camera with a special corrective lens to photograph that, as opposed to flipping it over and slapping it on a flatbed area.

29:18.942 --> 29:29.496
So our goal is not to destroy the original, but I don't think anyone would promise that they wouldn't destroy the original.

29:29.898 --> 29:48.360
However, with visual information, it's a little bit more of a concern.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.002
But before you go, I'll show you one more thing and then I'll let you off.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.665
But I do want to show you a project that we did with a scholar who works with German and one book.

29:52.831 --> 29:56.676
This was a really fun project.

29:56.696 --> 29:59.980
This will tell me how to get to all of these.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.044
Yeah, it'll tell you how to get to our main site.

30:03.064 --> 30:03.845
And all of these are freely accessible.

30:03.865 --> 30:08.271
One database that we often from a group of museums.

30:08.291 --> 30:13.497
We had to use...isn't that amazing?

30:13.518 --> 30:15.480
And this is a low resolution image.

30:15.764 --> 30:27.819
But here we had... Yeah, this was exactly why we wanted to capture as much as possible in color, even though most people can't think of it.

30:27.899 --> 30:29.000
It's a 500-year-old book.

30:29.221 --> 30:35.308
And of course no one's going to disturb that.

30:35.328 --> 30:35.388
No.

30:35.408 --> 30:38.212
But what we've done here is, we used two pictures.

30:38.852 --> 30:43.358
In some cases, these books were robust enough to be on a plastic skin.

30:43.338 --> 30:46.764
because their bindings were not as tight.

30:46.784 --> 30:54.377
But in other cases, you were working with a four inch by six inch book with a really tight binding that was 400 pages thick.

30:54.417 --> 30:58.444
So we used a digital camera to capture some of those images.

30:58.947 --> 31:02.611
And visual camera technology is getting better and better.

31:02.631 --> 31:09.859
And this equipment that you have here is outsourced as a company in town?

31:09.879 --> 31:15.646
We do some of the work in-house and some of the work we ask for.

31:15.666 --> 31:16.527
We are not yet a production facility.

31:16.547 --> 31:20.972
We wanted to focus first on a floratory project so we have a breadth of experience with different kinds of materials.

31:23.045 --> 31:50.183
pretty much where where it's left so that's the 17th century you haven't had any cumulus that you've been around to or not yet i mean barbara and i are working on this idea we were really pleased right now we have about 20 of these up this was a pilot project the whole book or just the uh these are the emblems from the book

31:50.399 --> 31:55.356
So textual content is quite irrelevant to the graphic side?

31:55.376 --> 32:00.915
We've taken the graphic side, but sometimes you'll find with emeralds there's text.

32:01.267 --> 32:27.020
and the scholar that's been working on this has done her own brand of indexing and we're committed to helping to put this up with the pictures and then crosswalking it into a bit more standard format that is retrievable alongside some of the other questions.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.383
Can you give a card in case I want to get the cards with you over your mic code?

32:30.157 --> 32:32.400
I do love email, by the way.

32:32.501 --> 32:34.223
I do, too.

32:34.484 --> 32:36.847
You know what?

32:37.007 --> 32:38.289
I don't have a card front.

32:38.309 --> 32:40.433
I have a writing in my notebook.

32:40.593 --> 32:46.842
And I can have an email on here.

32:47.223 --> 32:47.563
Okay.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.628
It's a small world.

32:53.072 --> 32:56.637
The book world is there.

33:00.059 --> 33:11.655
I am doing something like this.

33:12.631 --> 33:20.219
I'm going to take it from himself.

33:20.239 --> 33:23.623
I'm going to take it from himself.

33:24.104 --> 33:26.126
I'm going to take it from himself.

33:26.747 --> 33:29.570
I'm going to take it from him.

33:29.590 --> 33:33.394
I was doing a circle.

33:33.414 --> 33:34.916
I'm going to take it from him.

33:34.936 --> 33:35.536
I'm going to take it from him.

33:35.556 --> 33:36.157
I'm going to take it from him.

33:36.177 --> 33:37.018
I'm going to take it from him.

33:36.998 --> 33:44.900
Thanks a lot.

33:44.980 --> 33:49.694
Thanks a lot.

33:49.814 --> 33:52.020
Okay, good.

33:52.000 --> 34:09.344
Thank you.

34:09.424 --> 34:12.608
Thank you.

34:13.870 --> 34:27.492
Oh

34:28.012 --> 34:52.553
It's an important, you know, work.

34:52.573 --> 34:54.555
You get a good variety of people coming here, too, because we have so many different opportunities.

34:54.575 --> 34:55.255
Yeah, it's always good to have it.

34:55.275 --> 34:56.416
It's a working kit for you that we don't forget about it.

34:56.436 --> 34:57.377
It's very embarrassing when I get it correctly.

34:57.357 --> 35:23.726
I work on the library .

35:23.746 --> 35:24.327
I'm in front of the project .

35:24.307 --> 35:53.959
Um, the New York Times, I think, is that there are so many families that enter into the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of

35:53.939 --> 36:21.398
... ... ... ... ... ...

36:21.378 --> 36:51.334
What are you working on?

36:51.314 --> 37:05.813
Oh.

37:20.238 --> 37:38.466
Amen.

37:39.053 --> 37:49.088
This is your first visit to campus, I gather, from the interview I think about.

37:49.349 --> 37:50.010
From the radio, yeah.

37:50.350 --> 38:03.330
I don't know if you know that you obviously all know, but all of your calls, I was fascinated by everybody, all of your calls were from a little outline of time.

38:03.350 --> 38:03.450
Yeah.

38:03.470 --> 38:03.691
In Indiana.

38:03.711 --> 38:03.931
In Indiana.

38:03.951 --> 38:04.572
Yeah, in Indiana.

38:04.552 --> 38:11.387
The question was this.

38:11.407 --> 38:16.098
Yeah, well, then the war, which is this kind of thing.

38:16.118 --> 38:16.599
Right.

38:16.619 --> 38:18.864
Some of them.

38:18.884 --> 38:22.813
You said that the thing is right after, you know, we had 20 calls.

38:22.793 --> 38:37.586
That's a different one.

38:37.606 --> 38:37.707
Yeah.

38:37.727 --> 38:37.827
Yeah.

38:37.847 --> 38:39.390
And what they were trying to do is all from Aurora.

38:39.410 --> 38:41.796
And so when I heard it, they followed from Aurora.

38:41.816 --> 38:41.916
Okay.

38:41.896 --> 38:55.195
Spending your entire life.

38:55.215 --> 38:59.121
It's exciting in the 1930s.

38:59.522 --> 39:01.384
It's one of these priests.

39:01.685 --> 39:04.629
One of the next 50 years.

39:05.671 --> 39:09.456
And going over there and telling his widow.

39:09.757 --> 39:11.260
Yes, yes, yes.

39:11.621 --> 39:16.452
I'd love to know what, what's your step, what's your step?

39:16.472 --> 39:16.552
No.

39:16.572 --> 39:18.216
I love a step in any of that.

39:18.557 --> 39:21.163
Not, not an assumption.

39:21.183 --> 39:21.724
Oh, I think it was.

39:22.885 --> 39:45.775
That's a really fine line.

39:45.795 --> 39:47.197
It must have been regarded as one of the three other nuclear scholars.

39:47.217 --> 39:47.517
Oh, absolutely.

39:47.537 --> 39:48.699
In fact, you have been impressed with the nuclear science.

39:48.719 --> 39:49.019
It's very open.

39:49.039 --> 39:49.340
It's very open.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.002
Well, certainly there's a benefit in science to the extent of the nuclear science.

39:51.691 --> 40:15.025
No, they didn't get any money.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.728
I'd like to know what money is going to be funded, and I'm going to come back there.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.429
But they've had some campus money.

40:17.449 --> 40:18.951
There was a program called critical education, if it is funded by Stanford.

40:18.971 --> 40:20.854
That grant is going to be out of green, and I think they're going to hold it up to the public.

40:20.834 --> 40:26.033
What else?

40:27.399 --> 40:30.490
Everything is great.

40:36.832 --> 40:54.576
Well, I am down here, I can write it, and I'm a services coordinator, but I'm really interested in, I was interested in meeting you, because my very special day from the county is usually compulsive, and I'm going to work in it.

40:54.597 --> 40:57.861
I also have an interest in justice.

40:58.280 --> 41:14.685
Ten years ago, I published an article which I'd love to give you.

41:14.665 --> 41:32.330
Well, when you believe me, it's still like a chapel or something like that.

41:32.350 --> 41:36.977
No, no, it's just about the fellow.

41:36.997 --> 41:37.437
No, no, but... Really?

41:37.457 --> 41:38.499
I wish I had the time for when I was getting a book.

41:38.519 --> 41:40.982
No, I mean, I was excited, I think, because it's... You know, books, I mean, you keep books, so it's many... Books, books.

41:41.002 --> 41:42.164
And it's good when you hear a couple of others coming out.

41:42.184 --> 41:42.985
And it's very good when you can find it.

41:43.353 --> 41:49.401
You're a Russian, huh?

41:49.421 --> 41:49.821
Yes, yes.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.107
Did you get to St.

41:54.227 --> 41:54.668
Petersburg?

41:54.728 --> 41:58.893
I haven't been since it became St.

41:58.913 --> 41:59.274
Petersburg.

42:03.299 --> 42:03.780
Since it became St.

42:03.800 --> 42:04.100
Petersburg.

42:04.741 --> 42:07.184
Not since it was one of us.

42:07.204 --> 42:08.866
I really want to have a chapter in a new book about emigrate libraries.

42:08.886 --> 42:09.066
Oh, yeah.

42:09.087 --> 42:10.849
A whole lot of that material came over here during Soviet Union.

42:10.869 --> 42:11.510
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

42:11.530 --> 42:11.790
I don't know.

42:12.175 --> 42:14.423
I don't think I'm going to hate you anymore.

42:14.639 --> 42:20.325
Oh, really?

42:20.345 --> 42:26.091
They want the book by the end of the year.

42:26.111 --> 42:29.194
Oh, is it the same publisher?

42:29.314 --> 42:32.297
The same publisher?

42:32.317 --> 42:35.400
Well, I did a nice job with it.

42:35.420 --> 42:36.321
It's the same woman as you put those jackets.

42:36.341 --> 42:36.921
Yeah, absolutely.

42:36.941 --> 42:39.744
So the scope of the new project... It's not collecting at all.

42:39.884 --> 42:43.448
I mean, you can print out your life.

42:43.867 --> 42:55.482
book culture is in my subtitle.

42:55.502 --> 43:03.853
I'm really interested in the whole concept of book culture.

43:03.873 --> 43:07.938
I mean, I don't want to make a book.

43:07.958 --> 43:08.900
I'm really going to study what it is, you know.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.841
So you have all these reported palatine ships.

43:09.861 --> 43:11.503
And I'm really interested in the libraries and the really great speaking of Italy.

43:11.523 --> 43:12.304
I'm going to go to that.

43:12.672 --> 43:22.022
It's amazing.

43:22.282 --> 43:27.869
You're going to get six national libraries.

43:27.889 --> 43:28.810
Really?

43:28.830 --> 43:30.031
We've only got one.

43:30.051 --> 43:32.093
They've only been a country for 120 years.

43:32.113 --> 43:36.458
Does that make sense?

43:36.478 --> 43:37.259
They always collect reserves, you know?

43:37.279 --> 43:37.880
Yeah, sure.

43:37.900 --> 43:42.004
This is also something like 1,100 ecclesiastic libraries.

43:42.642 --> 43:51.734
I have 27,000 books, and that doesn't help with that in my book.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.117
There's a type of reading.

43:54.137 --> 43:54.277
Right.

43:54.297 --> 43:56.680
It's like a great private land.

43:56.960 --> 43:57.521
It's amazing.

43:57.541 --> 44:00.845
But as a book comes to it, it's still to stop that.

44:00.865 --> 44:03.148
It's important to focus on this prior.

44:03.168 --> 44:06.012
So all this stuff is going to be great.

44:06.032 --> 44:06.372
Yeah, everything.

44:09.777 --> 44:37.303
and then just talking about

44:43.240 --> 45:08.948
So I certainly try to define principles in my own.

45:08.968 --> 45:09.469
I can get enough of that.

45:09.489 --> 45:10.090
This is one of my main fields.

45:10.110 --> 45:10.310
Thank you.

45:10.330 --> 45:10.530
Thank you.

45:10.510 --> 45:30.612
Thank you.

45:43.957 --> 45:56.610
I did.

45:56.630 --> 45:59.253
It's busy.

45:59.273 --> 46:10.525
Enjoy.

46:10.545 --> 46:12.327
I love this.

46:12.307 --> 46:18.975
Oh

46:23.107 --> 46:46.836
Oh

46:48.942 --> 47:13.431
Oh!

48:35.187 --> 48:43.847
Oh.

48:49.328 --> 49:05.970
I want it down.

49:05.950 --> 49:34.168
Thank you.

49:34.148 --> 50:01.013
Okay, we're going to change back.

50:01.033 --> 50:01.293
We have got .

50:01.313 --> 50:01.333

50:01.353 --> 50:01.373

Hello.

54:11.978 --> 54:30.325
Oh, not just one brick.

Thank you.

55:15.850 --> 55:41.908
Thank you.

55:41.888 --> 56:09.010
Cowboy had

56:08.990 --> 56:35.200
uh...

56:35.180 --> 57:00.062
So I said, I want to interview this guy.

57:00.082 --> 57:00.883
So I said, I want to interview this guy.
