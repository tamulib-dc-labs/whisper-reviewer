00:03.558 --> 00:11.965
1934, Bennett Cerf and Donald Crawford put the Great Gaspers and Martin Harbury.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.468
Discontinued title.

00:15.488 --> 00:17.990
They couldn't sell it yet, 95 cents.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.171
Discontinued title.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.062
Discontinued title.

00:32.123 --> 00:32.603
More evidence.

00:34.844 --> 00:40.432
As I've tried to leave the game, God, I hate the rich in chat.

00:40.452 --> 00:41.734
It cheapens literature.

00:42.295 --> 00:52.030
It substitutes gossip for history.

00:54.774 --> 01:03.687
The book was so worthless that in 1937, the general was delighted to sell

01:05.000 --> 01:06.281
Sunday's magazine.

01:06.341 --> 01:08.403
Newspaper.

01:09.504 --> 01:09.844
Right.

01:13.267 --> 01:14.828
Maybe he got $75.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.650
Maybe.

01:17.731 --> 01:22.815
So when did the great renaissance, when is he recognized?

01:23.135 --> 01:24.576
At what point?

01:24.596 --> 01:29.701
The first step is 1945, the publication of the crack-up.

01:29.721 --> 01:30.021
Hasn't.

01:30.581 --> 01:32.723
Good reception.

01:32.743 --> 01:34.905
Same year, two things happened.

01:35.746 --> 01:42.153
Number one, it appears in paperback at 25 cents.

01:45.736 --> 01:47.779
This is not the paperback.

01:47.799 --> 01:48.119
Yes, it is.

01:48.139 --> 01:55.847
It appears in paperback at 25 cents, and this would be interesting if for no other reason than it's got a paperback with a jacket.

01:58.069 --> 01:59.130
Could I tell you something?

01:59.150 --> 02:00.492
It appears 25 cents.

02:00.512 --> 02:03.475
It was one of the first 10 banters.

02:03.944 --> 02:06.967
When Bantam began in 1945, they gave them 10 titles.

02:07.447 --> 02:09.949
This is one of the first 10.

02:11.211 --> 02:13.132
This makes it affordable at 25 cents.

02:13.293 --> 02:22.481
And at the same time, at the end of World War II, it appears in the armed services editions.

02:24.142 --> 02:25.724
Which I understand you're collecting now.

02:26.465 --> 02:31.369
We are 20 short of the complete

02:32.007 --> 02:32.768
collection.

02:33.789 --> 02:36.993
We know of no one who has built a complete and erect collection.

02:37.373 --> 02:42.980
There are allegedly two complete collections which were given at the time.

02:43.020 --> 02:46.524
No one has ever succeeded in reconstructing them.

02:46.544 --> 02:49.948
In 1945, 50,000 copies of this were given away.

02:49.968 --> 02:58.858
50,000 given away to kids who never had the time or the inclination to read before.

02:59.800 --> 03:06.207
There they were sitting on some godforsaken island in the Pacific with nothing to do except jack off and read.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.011
The ones who didn't jack off read.

03:11.734 --> 03:15.898
Do you think they read it?

03:16.019 --> 03:16.219
Yes.

03:16.719 --> 03:20.464
Do you think this had anything to do with his burgeoning reputation?

03:20.484 --> 03:21.845
Yes, I just said so.

03:22.326 --> 03:23.667
Have you ever heard me tell you a lie?

03:25.449 --> 03:29.554
They came back to the United States, not some of them, but stateside.

03:30.007 --> 03:32.530
And they remembered.

03:32.570 --> 03:40.219
They remembered having read it.

03:40.599 --> 03:44.184
Jim Dickey, the James Dickey movies across the hall.

03:44.204 --> 03:48.228
Jim Dickey remembers reading the Arms Services editions.

03:48.248 --> 03:50.551
Who selected the titles for them, do you think?

03:51.132 --> 03:59.001
Well, it was chaired by Philip Van Doren Stern, a publishing figure best known as the author of the short story from which the Christmas movie

03:59.183 --> 04:00.064
A wonderful life.

04:00.425 --> 04:02.167
So was he trying to entertain the troops?

04:02.227 --> 04:03.509
Was he trying to enlighten them?

04:03.549 --> 04:04.791
Was he trying to instruct them?

04:04.811 --> 04:07.354
The publishers wanted to do something patriotic.

04:07.695 --> 04:08.716
I don't know if you were around.

04:08.836 --> 04:09.377
I was around.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.480
Everybody wanted to do something patriotic.

04:12.001 --> 04:17.548
So the publishing industry said our contribution to the war effort would be the armed service editions.

04:17.589 --> 04:22.455
They formed a committee to pick the books.

04:22.636 --> 04:24.678
Jesus, I'd love to have the minutes of the committee.

04:25.159 --> 04:25.900
How much...

04:27.466 --> 04:32.433
wheeling and dealing went on, you know, because this was a chance to promote their own authors.

04:33.094 --> 04:36.178
They formed a committee of publishers to pick the books.

04:36.819 --> 04:39.523
Van Doren Stern was the honcho.

04:39.603 --> 04:40.725
He ran the operation.

04:42.728 --> 04:56.427
I think that their intention was entertainment, because easily half the books were sports books, mystery books, westerns.

04:57.098 --> 05:00.786
damn westerns and the sports books are the hardest ones to find.

05:01.908 --> 05:04.173
Why do you suppose?

05:04.474 --> 05:06.438
Because they were popular and read to pieces.

05:08.443 --> 05:13.333
One of the ones I lack is a biography of Bob Feller.

05:13.353 --> 05:15.057
I think that will be the last one I get.

05:15.813 --> 05:17.896
The next and the last one will be a Zane Gray.

05:17.997 --> 05:19.038
Do you ever see them?

05:19.058 --> 05:20.100
Do you go eBaying?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.943
When I see them, I buy them.

05:21.963 --> 05:24.568
Do you know John Hench of the American American Society?

05:24.608 --> 05:25.890
John's doing a collection.

05:26.070 --> 05:29.135
It's not meant, I think, to be comprehensive.

05:31.439 --> 05:38.972
There are roughly 1,200 separate titles, and we've got about 1,010.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.057
How long have you been doing it?

05:44.483 --> 05:45.844
Since the day Mr. Wyllie.

05:46.205 --> 05:46.905
Oh, since a while.

05:47.086 --> 05:50.609
Mr. Wyllie showed me my first armed services edition in 1954.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.711
Oh, so you've been at it for a while.

05:53.232 --> 05:56.515
Mr. Wyllie was the Grab Books curator at the University of Virginia.

05:56.935 --> 05:59.558
He was the best bookman I've ever known in my life.

06:00.238 --> 06:09.027
Everything I am, everything I've done, everything I hope to be as a bookman, I owe to Mr. Wyllie's training.

06:09.047 --> 06:10.729
So how does a person like that inspire you?

06:11.590 --> 06:12.010
Yes, ma'am.

06:12.142 --> 06:14.344
Excuse me, Carol is on the phone.

06:14.364 --> 06:17.348
She has Cassandra on the phone for me.

06:17.368 --> 06:19.370
If you'd like to do a quick content call, please.

06:19.950 --> 06:21.232
Who the hell is Cassandra?

06:21.252 --> 06:23.154
Um, she's, it relates to insurance.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.595
Beg your pardon?

06:25.236 --> 06:27.458
It relates to an exam and insurance.

06:27.499 --> 06:29.260
Oh, I've got to take an exam and insurance.

06:29.280 --> 06:29.561
Excuse me.

06:29.581 --> 06:30.021
Look around.

06:30.261 --> 06:30.562
Peace out.

06:30.582 --> 06:30.842
Look around.

06:30.962 --> 06:31.523
I'll be back.

06:37.109 --> 06:38.070
This room is fabulous.

06:38.090 --> 06:38.651
Isn't it great?

06:38.951 --> 06:39.111
Yeah.

06:41.808 --> 07:01.713
Well, I hope after I transcribe this tape and get some good idea of where I'm going, I'd like to talk again, if that would be.

07:01.753 --> 07:03.495
Of course.

07:03.644 --> 07:06.207
Wall, that's fabulous wall back here.

07:06.227 --> 07:08.110
Those are the abouts.

07:08.330 --> 07:09.051
But with you in it.

07:09.091 --> 07:11.314
Well, this section over here, maybe both.

07:11.334 --> 07:12.976
I mean, there's plenty of film.

07:12.996 --> 07:14.538
I think this is more interesting.

07:16.900 --> 07:28.154
This is the material that you said, just pick a... It's the show's library card, for example.

07:28.174 --> 07:31.879
I'll cut the one going into this section like this.

07:36.517 --> 07:38.319
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

07:40.061 --> 07:40.942
Well, we covered a lot.

07:43.886 --> 07:48.171
This was a bibliography.

07:48.471 --> 07:54.278
We did a bibliography three, four years ago.

07:57.121 --> 08:01.807
More than that, 1997, we did a bibliography of the catalog of the collection.

08:01.827 --> 08:06.152
Not a bibliography, a catalog of the collection, and I wasn't satisfied with it.

08:06.807 --> 08:16.884
So, we are publishing, later this year, a two-volume catalog of the collection, profusely illustrated.

08:16.964 --> 08:24.056
We're going to illustrate every inscription in the collection, and as many manuscripts and letters as we can.

08:24.917 --> 08:28.063
Because when you flip page, you'll never see what you're looking for.

08:29.685 --> 08:31.729
And the university will be publishing it?

08:31.749 --> 08:33.051
It will be co-publication.

08:33.436 --> 08:36.560
University of South Carolina Press for the Thomas Cooper Library.

08:36.760 --> 08:41.206
Excellent.

08:41.406 --> 08:54.163
I think that what you've done as a collector, as a scholar, there aren't many people who combine all of these passions into one package and who uses it all so... I've been lucky.

08:55.584 --> 08:57.587
If you don't believe in luck, you're a goddamn fool.

08:58.368 --> 08:59.490
I've been lucky.

08:59.530 --> 09:01.452
You told me you went to the auction

09:01.752 --> 09:03.334
It was luck.

09:03.575 --> 09:04.977
I'm not sure.

09:05.177 --> 09:07.080
You said, there's no such thing as luck in collecting.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.482
I like that line.

09:09.023 --> 09:16.955
I was called, Fraser Cough, my partner, always used to say, it's all about paying attention.

09:16.995 --> 09:19.078
The ones who pay attention get the books.

09:19.739 --> 09:25.127
However, when Elizabeth came in to tell me I was wanted on the phone, you were asking me about John Cook Wyllie.

09:25.748 --> 09:28.772
W-Y-L-L-I-E.

09:29.123 --> 09:33.469
who was curator of rare books at the University of South Carolina.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.393
I'm sorry, the University of Virginia Alderman Library.

09:37.094 --> 09:43.482
John Cook Wyllie, curator of rare books, Alderman Library, University of Virginia.

09:45.465 --> 09:57.882
I met him in 1954, and that was the precise moment at which I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

09:58.756 --> 10:08.226
What was there about him or the example that he set that was such an epiphany for you?

10:08.246 --> 10:18.677
Mr. Wyllie knew more about books and literature than anyone I'd ever met before or since.

10:19.898 --> 10:27.666
And as Mr. Wyllie spent time with me, he'd set projects for me.

10:28.000 --> 10:40.537
I never took a course with him because he didn't teach, but he was the greatest teacher I ever had, because as long as I was around him, which was almost seven years, he'd keep inventing projects for me.

10:41.659 --> 10:57.400
For example, when Virginia got the Hinman collating machine, I did the first collation of a modern book on, it was at Scott Pichel's This Side of Paradise.

10:57.869 --> 11:05.236
I did the first collation of a modern book on the hymn and collating machine, because Mr. Wyllie suggested it.

11:05.556 --> 11:07.358
He never gave me an order.

11:07.518 --> 11:08.960
He never told me to do anything.

11:10.301 --> 11:12.223
But he thought it was something that was worthwhile to you.

11:12.243 --> 11:14.705
He would mention interesting projects.

11:16.647 --> 11:20.711
But mainly, he would show me things.

11:21.311 --> 11:23.173
He showed me my first armed services.

11:23.193 --> 11:24.214
I don't know what the hell it was.

11:24.915 --> 11:27.117
He showed me my first armed services edition.

11:27.670 --> 11:34.556
And I began realizing that these things are rarer and getting rarer by the day.

11:35.637 --> 11:38.720
You can still get them now, but the time is going to come when you can't get them.

11:39.381 --> 11:54.555
And moreover, I began asking the question, how did the inclusion of certain books and certain authors in the greatest cultural giveaway in history do simple arithmetic, never mind 1,200 titles,

11:54.873 --> 11:57.937
Say 1,000 titles and 50,000 copies each.

11:58.899 --> 12:00.141
I think you get 500 million.

12:01.482 --> 12:04.807
If you don't get 500 million, you get 50 million.

12:05.348 --> 12:07.792
I can't keep the zeros in my head.

12:08.312 --> 12:19.969
But it was the greatest book giveaway since Gutenberg produced the Bible, which he didn't give away.

12:20.472 --> 12:24.956
And Mr. Wyllie showed me, I don't know which one, showed me an Armed Services edition.

12:24.976 --> 12:26.718
Didn't they do something like that in the First World War?

12:27.078 --> 12:28.199
No, no.

12:28.379 --> 12:30.321
The Brits did.

12:31.322 --> 12:34.264
And I'm surprised Mr. Patrick Scott didn't show it to you.

12:34.785 --> 12:37.087
The Brits did in newspaper format.

12:43.913 --> 12:49.618
Excerpts from classic English lit, which came with an envelope.

12:50.172 --> 12:56.565
And you could mail it to the soldiers at the front, who presumably were sitting in the trenches reading Milton and Shakespeare.

12:57.627 --> 12:58.468
Well, presumably.

12:58.488 --> 12:59.530
Oh, it's a lovely thing.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.075
Maybe before you leave, you get Patrick to show you.

13:02.316 --> 13:03.298
We have that complete.

13:03.879 --> 13:11.995
We've got the complete World War I London Times set of readers and the envelopes.

13:12.886 --> 13:17.593
So did Wyllie, would you regard him as a mentor for you?

13:17.733 --> 13:18.354
More than that.

13:18.775 --> 13:22.420
I told you, everything I have done, everything I will ever do.

13:22.820 --> 13:24.984
Was he mindfully assuming the role of mentor?

13:25.004 --> 13:28.749
I mean, did you think he kind of picked you on as a... I picked him out.

13:30.512 --> 13:31.093
What a story.

13:32.675 --> 13:38.944
What's the first book that made you, that you acquired with the knowledge that you were acquiring something special beyond the text?

13:39.329 --> 13:50.204
that it had value, and I don't mean dollars and cents, but I mean as a cultural artifact that you were acquiring for purposes beyond the reading of the book.

13:52.947 --> 14:08.408
The week of my graduation from Yale, in the basement of Whitlock's, which was a textbook store in New Haven, in the basement they had used books, and I found two Fitzgeralds in the basement.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.541
One was $5, one was $750, under $10.

14:13.023 --> 14:23.537
And those would be the first books I bought for their bibliophilic appeal.

14:25.019 --> 14:35.152
And so you knew with that, if you didn't know it before that, beforehand, you knew then you're acquiring... Yes.

14:35.172 --> 14:37.635
By the time I graduated,

14:39.455 --> 14:41.457
I knew I was going to Yale.

14:41.657 --> 14:44.479
I knew I was going to specialize on an author.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.282
And I thought it would be Hemingway.

14:48.062 --> 14:54.808
But my favorite teacher at Yale was Charles Fenton, who wrote the book about Hemingway's journalism.

14:56.169 --> 14:59.992
And I figured out that I could never compete with Mr. Fenton.

15:00.773 --> 15:08.820
So instead of Hemingway, I chose Fitzgerald, which was a fortunate move.

15:09.408 --> 15:23.928
because I had almost no competition for Fitzgerald, and already the Hemingway field was crowded, and because I think I bring certain equipment to the study of Fitzgerald that perhaps other people do not have.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.554
But anyhow, that decision made for the wrong reason.

15:28.674 --> 15:31.398
Well, Mr. Fenton is doing Hemingway, so I'll do something else.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.943
Turned out again to be another stroke of luck.

15:38.821 --> 15:47.872
And I began buying books, but... And then you become a publisher.

15:47.912 --> 15:49.494
What's the motivation to be a publisher?

15:49.514 --> 15:54.139
It can't be a commercial... Well, the name Fraser Clark keeps coming up.

15:54.219 --> 15:54.700
C.E.

15:54.760 --> 15:59.346
Fraser Clark, Jr., Fraser Clark, who was the greatest Hawthorne collective who ever lived.

16:00.887 --> 16:07.275
And I agreed that...

16:08.639 --> 16:25.155
There were reference tools, especially bibliographies and checklists, needed for the study of literature, for the collecting of literature, and they didn't exist.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.098
Or if they existed, they weren't good enough.

16:29.158 --> 16:31.901
So, Fraser and I both borrowed on our insurance policies.

16:32.622 --> 16:38.207
It's a miracle our insurance policies didn't wear out, because we borrowed on them so frequently.

16:38.558 --> 16:44.926
We borrowed our insurance money, and we began publishing checklists.

16:46.127 --> 16:52.455
Then we began publishing collector's editions or limited editions from books in our collections.

16:55.359 --> 17:07.013
And the phrase, who lived in Detroit, was a good friend to a man named Frederick Ruffner,

17:07.465 --> 17:08.887
I know I've met Mr. Ruffner.

17:08.907 --> 17:12.612
Who owned, who founded and owned Gale.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.014
Gale, yeah.

17:14.034 --> 17:20.043
And Mr. Ruffner began asking us for advice about publishing reference books.

17:20.984 --> 17:31.279
And finally the day came when we became an imprint within the Gale empire.

17:31.539 --> 17:33.422
He made a ton of money on Gale.

17:33.706 --> 17:34.187
Sure he did.

17:34.207 --> 17:35.909
Yeah, well, I'm popular to him.

17:36.289 --> 17:42.778
I do a thing in Fort Lauderdale where they have authors now, and he was the host at his home.

17:42.958 --> 17:45.822
He's made a lot of money out of books, and he's put a lot back.

17:45.962 --> 17:46.844
Yeah, he's a sweet man.

17:46.884 --> 17:47.565
Very nice man.

17:48.326 --> 18:02.785
And because of my friendship with Freyze and Freyze's friendship with Mr. Ruffner, we became the Brooklyn Clark imprint.

18:04.452 --> 18:09.618
Freese was far more adventurous than I was.

18:10.459 --> 18:11.440
Freese was a gambler.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.223
Freese loved to take chances.

18:14.303 --> 18:14.984
Are you a gambler?

18:15.004 --> 18:15.764
You're not.

18:15.805 --> 18:18.087
No, I'm a very cautious and conservative man.

18:18.127 --> 18:19.348
I don't talk like it, but I am.

18:20.069 --> 18:27.838
Well, see, you don't regard acquisitions like some of the spectacular ones that you've done as a role in the dance.

18:28.158 --> 18:29.420
It's a short thing, in your view.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.180
Of course.

18:30.220 --> 18:32.603
Interesting.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.852
No risk, no gamble, no chance.

18:35.734 --> 18:39.358
How the hell can you go wrong on a Gatsby?

18:39.378 --> 18:44.324
Oh, and along the way, I met a wonderful man, Charles Feinberg.

18:44.925 --> 18:45.526
You ever heard of him?

18:45.586 --> 18:45.786
No.

18:46.186 --> 18:52.915
Charlie Feinberg was the man who built the greatest Whitman collection the world has ever known and placed it at the Library of Congress.

18:53.916 --> 19:01.425
I first met Charlie, when Mr. Wyllie used to bring bookmen, book collectors, into the University of Virginia to talk to students.

19:02.266 --> 19:09.254
And Charlie Feinberg came to talk about collecting Whitman.

19:09.274 --> 19:25.811
I didn't know who the hell he was, but he described how, as a poor boy in Canada, he used to shine shoes in the street, a shoe shine box, and with the nickels.

19:27.593 --> 19:31.918
He would go to a bookstore and read the nickels.

19:32.270 --> 19:37.618
leave the nickels, until he had fifty cents or seventy-five cents, and then he could buy a Whitman.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.922
And that moved me deeply.

19:40.803 --> 19:46.652
What was there about Whitman that was driving this kid to... Oh, he said... What was it that resonated with this kid?

19:46.673 --> 19:56.908
He grew up in a Jewish Orthodox household, and he said, reading Whitman was like reading the Torah, the scriptures.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.172
Wow.

19:59.438 --> 20:06.024
Anyhow, Charlie, who was 25, 30 years older than I, and I became devoted friends.

20:07.065 --> 20:18.497
And Charlie said to me, Matt, if you've never seen it before, buy it.

20:18.677 --> 20:19.818
You may never see it again.

20:20.739 --> 20:26.344
And two, Matt, it costs more today than it cost yesterday.

20:27.005 --> 20:29.007
But tomorrow it'll cost even more.

20:29.324 --> 20:29.765
Buy it.

20:30.606 --> 20:31.547
And those two rules.

20:31.587 --> 20:33.410
That's good rules, Edward.

20:34.592 --> 20:37.375
I think of all the books I could have had 20 years ago.

20:37.395 --> 20:39.899
The only ones you regret are the ones you don't buy.

20:40.179 --> 20:44.706
You never regret buying a book, and you never pay too much for a book.

20:45.086 --> 20:47.890
No matter what you pay, you can't overpay for a book.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.533
Assuming it's a good book, obviously.

20:49.633 --> 20:51.636
But that's where judgment is.

20:52.016 --> 20:57.424
Charles Feinberg was a great bookman, and he was a great American.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.617
He came here as a penniless orphan boy.

21:00.478 --> 21:01.499
No, he wasn't an orphan.

21:01.719 --> 21:09.530
He came here as a penniless immigrant boy, and he built this great, great library, which he turned over to the Library of Congress.

21:10.111 --> 21:13.235
And how did he make his fortune at some point?

21:13.435 --> 21:13.755
Sure.

21:13.916 --> 21:15.137
He came here penniless.

21:15.337 --> 21:16.379
So what was his profession?

21:16.419 --> 21:17.360
Speedway Oil.

21:17.941 --> 21:20.044
Speedway Oil.

21:20.064 --> 21:21.986
Was he formally educated, or did he just...?

21:22.006 --> 21:23.308
No, grammar school education.

21:23.328 --> 21:24.530
And Whitman did something.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.073
Were there any other authors, or was there Whitman?

21:27.425 --> 21:28.587
Robert Frost.

21:28.607 --> 21:29.368
Robert Frost.

21:29.428 --> 21:30.930
A big Robert Frost collection.

21:31.010 --> 21:32.172
He knew Robert Frost.

21:32.192 --> 21:32.853
Plus poetry.

21:33.694 --> 21:34.115
Poetry.

21:34.475 --> 21:39.002
Ann Whitman was his two greatest loves.

21:40.364 --> 21:48.956
And I adored Charlie because I'm a sucker for American success stories.

21:49.777 --> 21:53.042
My father was an American success story.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.323
He was a shoeshine.

21:54.344 --> 21:55.665
He was a nice shoeshine boy.

21:55.705 --> 21:56.807
He was a stable boy.

21:57.665 --> 22:01.289
And he went from stable boy to be able to afford me.

22:01.970 --> 22:06.415
And I have to tell you, that's a great climb up in the world.

22:06.475 --> 22:13.522
Because most of my father's life was a struggle to make money faster than I could spend it.

22:14.423 --> 22:16.426
And he managed to keep a little ahead of me.

22:17.847 --> 22:18.648
That's true, by the way.

22:18.668 --> 22:19.469
That's a great story.

22:19.809 --> 22:22.352
My father was brought up in a Protestant orphanage.

22:22.472 --> 22:23.534
He was a kid of the streets.

22:23.554 --> 22:25.235
He died this last year at 91.

22:25.916 --> 22:27.638
And the pole brought a wonderful open on him.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.732
I helped him with it.

22:29.752 --> 22:31.394
He was a wrestler during prohibition.

22:31.414 --> 22:34.117
All of these, you talk about these American success stories.

22:34.217 --> 22:36.660
There you go.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.081
It was just one of these inspirational.

22:38.281 --> 22:42.146
I'd love to get a picture of you with the Fitzgerald briefcase, if I may.

22:42.366 --> 22:43.667
What did he do with it?

22:43.687 --> 22:47.652
He had it this morning with the little group.

22:47.692 --> 22:49.874
He said, everybody in my life.

22:50.095 --> 22:51.256
He said, I've had fun.

22:51.516 --> 22:53.779
Christ, if I had fun.

22:53.799 --> 22:57.743
Everybody, except for my parents.

22:58.094 --> 23:07.826
But including my wife, who's been closest to me, most valuable to me, most precious to me, was Book Connected.

23:09.288 --> 23:27.291
When I married in 1957, I really became a book collector, because I had a home for the first time, and I proceeded to spend our eating money

23:27.541 --> 23:34.969
our food money, our rent money on books, and Arlen never once said, how are you going to pay for it?

23:35.029 --> 23:35.830
You can't afford it.

23:36.731 --> 23:38.653
She never said, I want a fur coat instead.

23:38.993 --> 23:40.895
I want clothing instead of your books.

23:42.818 --> 23:44.159
But did she share the passion?

23:44.179 --> 23:46.121
Yeah, with her, Jane Austen.

23:46.802 --> 23:56.232
When we were poor students, we were in Providence, Rhode Island, and she saw this, which I didn't have,

23:56.532 --> 23:59.896
And she bought it for $10, which happened to be our eating money.

24:02.459 --> 24:06.424
She blew our eating money on a copy of Taps It, Reveille, and Dust Jacket.

24:06.544 --> 24:07.225
For $10.

24:08.066 --> 24:08.987
God bless her.

24:09.007 --> 24:11.510
I saw the Zelda stuff, by the way, the paintings.

24:12.070 --> 24:12.971
Fantastic.

24:13.472 --> 24:16.475
That woman had really, I think, professional talent.

24:16.716 --> 24:24.565
It is not a gesture of...

24:29.320 --> 24:32.304
marriage devotion.

24:33.566 --> 24:40.216
Her name is on the collection because without Arlen, there would not have been this collection.

24:40.997 --> 24:45.944
I could not have done it without her approval.

24:45.964 --> 24:48.367
I could not have done it without her approval.

24:49.128 --> 24:54.256
There's a woman who stayed home while I traveled all over the world buying books, looking for books.

24:56.880 --> 24:57.961
She stayed home with the children.

24:58.061 --> 24:58.602
I traveled.

24:59.476 --> 25:03.081
That resonates with me in ways that you can't... I got it.

25:03.201 --> 25:03.582
That was good.

25:03.602 --> 25:04.343
That was a good catch.

25:06.426 --> 25:07.106
You can't imagine.

25:07.227 --> 25:12.053
When I was quitting my job as a newspaper man... Well, you still have a column, don't you?

25:12.374 --> 25:12.934
I gave it up.

25:15.858 --> 25:18.282
Spent his time at Princeton Wright.

25:19.724 --> 25:23.349
And it was extraordinary for a freshman to write the Triangle Club show.

25:24.610 --> 25:28.656
The first Triangle Club show that he wrote was Five Five Fee Fee.

25:29.952 --> 25:36.739
which was published as a kind of souvenir libretto which they sold to performances.

25:37.240 --> 25:42.545
This is the acting script printed for the cast.

25:44.207 --> 25:45.368
There are two of them in the world.

25:46.049 --> 25:46.990
Princeton has one.

25:47.530 --> 25:48.331
We have one.

25:49.132 --> 25:52.436
Our copy has the extra lyrics by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

25:53.957 --> 25:56.260
And where are you finding these things?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.542
I wrote to every surviving

25:59.011 --> 26:27.639
member of the classes of 1917, 1916, 1915, 1914, saying, I would not presume to offer you money, but if you have any material relating to the Triangle Club productions for 1914, 15, and 16, I would be very happy to make a generous donation to Princeton University in your name.

26:28.320 --> 26:28.680
It worked.

26:30.314 --> 26:48.963
Any other collecting stories like that from writing people?

26:52.249 --> 26:54.512
Uh... Yeah.

26:55.474 --> 26:55.714
Uh...

27:03.946 --> 27:21.912
One day, I was working at Princeton, and there was his scrapbook, and it had a front page of a parody newspaper called the St.

27:21.932 --> 27:30.865
Paul Daily Dirge that Fitzgerald had written and had printed and passed out of the dance as a gag.

27:31.807 --> 27:34.369
God, I wanted one.

27:34.389 --> 27:35.731
Princeton didn't even have one.

27:35.771 --> 27:40.655
They had the part of the front page pasted in the scrapbook.

27:40.675 --> 27:45.219
And I got hold of a Minneapolis phone book and a St.

27:45.279 --> 27:46.120
Paul phone book.

27:47.081 --> 27:52.906
And I wrote to every name that had a Fitzgerald connection.

27:53.967 --> 27:55.228
And I wrote and I wrote and I wrote.

27:55.768 --> 28:00.953
And finally, somebody said, yes, I've got one.

28:01.321 --> 28:07.368
mint condition, which I bought, and it's probably in the Fitzgerald room, because I don't see it here.

28:08.869 --> 28:11.592
I would call that a case of rescuing something, too.

28:11.652 --> 28:14.475
Isn't that what a collector does?

28:14.496 --> 28:14.916
Yeah, really.

28:17.239 --> 28:19.781
He rescues, he preserves.

28:19.881 --> 28:22.244
Rescue, preserve, and pass on.

28:23.285 --> 28:29.472
Oftentimes, the obvious thing

28:30.093 --> 28:30.874
is what works.

28:31.835 --> 28:36.743
It doesn't take a lot of brains to write the same letter and mail it to 50, 100 people.

28:37.163 --> 28:41.850
Well, but it takes a lot of time, and you have to go find who all these people are.

28:41.870 --> 28:43.392
It's not just writing and posting a letter.

28:43.412 --> 28:46.436
It's determining who they are, getting their addresses.

28:46.456 --> 28:49.200
I'll tell you what's really dazzled me in my trip here.

28:49.761 --> 28:56.691
I've never seen, and I really have, an institution with active people like yourself who are collectors and who actually have worked

28:57.008 --> 29:00.132
synergistically to build collections at an institution.

29:01.013 --> 29:06.319
Is there something in the water town here in South Carolina that has produced this kind of delightful alchemy?

29:06.540 --> 29:15.610
Well, Ross Roy was here before I came, and you spoke to him, and you know how he became a collector.

29:16.552 --> 29:25.142
I was a collector before I came here, and to my great dismay,

29:25.679 --> 29:38.992
When I came here, I discovered the head librarian was a bitter enemy of books, and discouraged acquisition of material.

29:39.873 --> 29:45.819
He's the one who refused, quote, to give shelf space to James Dickey, quote.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.883
And I can attest to that, because I'm the one the son of a bitch said it to.

29:52.785 --> 29:55.568
And for a good twenty years,

29:56.122 --> 30:04.431
All I could do was collect for myself, because there was no institutional support at all.

30:04.451 --> 30:07.634
And Ross Roy collected by himself at home.

30:08.275 --> 30:09.957
I collected by myself at home.

30:10.558 --> 30:24.913
Joel Myerson, who came a couple of years after I did, was building his American Renaissance, a really transcendentalist collection, not to the library.

30:25.282 --> 30:28.025
because he needed it for his scholarship.

30:28.746 --> 30:31.169
I needed my books for my scholarship.

30:33.332 --> 30:37.818
I've been called intolerant, which strikes me as a vile slander.

30:38.378 --> 30:53.938
I'll be goddamned if I can understand how people can do serious scholarship or serious teaching without access to the key books and without owning the key books themselves.

30:54.948 --> 31:20.278
And I regarded building my collections and, you know, every one of my bibliographies, my James Gou Cousins bibliography, my Ross McDonnell bibliography, my Ring Lordner bibliography, my John O'Hara bibliography, every one of them was compiled only after I had built the collection.

31:21.059 --> 31:23.402
That's amazing.

31:24.479 --> 31:35.076
I regarded book collecting as the obligatory and mandatory occupation of a scholar.

31:35.637 --> 31:51.702
I repeat, I don't know how these other sons of bitches can claim to be scholars when they don't have access and don't want, as near as I can tell, access to

31:52.559 --> 31:56.042
the great books in their field, the key works in their fields.

31:58.405 --> 32:05.771
I can understand why for one reason or another, family responsibilities, improperly trained wives.

32:06.692 --> 32:14.800
I think the most important decision a book collector makes in his life is not what to collect, but picking the wife who's not going to interfere.

32:17.663 --> 32:20.085
I think my wife also knew.

32:20.740 --> 32:22.783
You met her last night, a smart woman.

32:22.803 --> 32:27.230
She was smart enough to understand, never to make me choose between the books and her.

32:28.452 --> 32:29.394
And she never has.

32:30.576 --> 32:32.419
I'm not saying how it would have come out.

32:32.759 --> 32:34.182
It's just an unbelievable quote.

32:34.222 --> 32:35.444
I mean, I have no idea.

32:35.524 --> 32:36.686
It would have been a close thing.

32:37.006 --> 32:38.449
It would have been a very close thing.

32:40.171 --> 32:47.082
And... Don't move, don't move.

32:47.163 --> 32:47.764
I just like that.

32:47.784 --> 32:48.064
I did.

32:49.681 --> 32:51.644
I formed my collections.

32:51.985 --> 32:53.527
You know, the Fitzgerald is one of a dozen.

32:54.669 --> 32:57.053
It's the best, but it's one of a dozen.

32:57.073 --> 33:15.081
I formed my collections because I needed them in order to write books, compile bibliographies, and work on this lifelong concern with the profession of authorship in America.

33:17.086 --> 33:19.348
How did American authors live?

33:19.448 --> 33:21.009
How did American authors write?

33:21.490 --> 33:26.894
What was the relationship between American authors and their readers, their editors, their publishers?

33:29.957 --> 33:31.098
And you've been here since 1960?

33:31.178 --> 33:33.040
I came here in 1969.

33:33.060 --> 33:34.381
So it's 25 years for you.

33:35.102 --> 33:35.842
No, 34.

33:35.942 --> 33:37.684
Wow, man.

33:37.844 --> 33:39.385
That's terrible.

33:39.405 --> 33:40.126
34.

33:40.146 --> 33:40.426
35.

33:41.027 --> 33:41.647
Going on 35.

33:41.747 --> 33:42.888
Well, this is the four.

33:42.908 --> 33:44.410
We're into the four already.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.131
Yeah, but it's early in the four.

33:46.516 --> 33:47.678
I came here in September.

33:48.338 --> 33:51.102
I came here in the summer, I guess, of 1969.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.205
This will be your 35th year here.

33:54.226 --> 33:55.147
Will be.

33:55.167 --> 33:55.508
Wow.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.051
This is good stuff.

33:58.171 --> 33:59.353
I'll be back in touch with you.

33:59.733 --> 34:03.418
And for the first 20 years, I wasn't allowed to buy a book for the library.

34:03.438 --> 34:13.772
If that incompetent lunatic who impeded me,

34:16.013 --> 34:33.231
hadn't squandered 20 years of my work by preventing me for 20 years from acquiring collections for the library, holy jumping Christ would we have a great research collection here.

34:33.291 --> 34:34.472
Well, you do, but you do.

34:34.532 --> 34:37.435
Well, we have now an almost great.

34:38.196 --> 34:45.463
So, I mean, I'm going to go off into a whole other tangent, but what directions would you have really gone?

34:45.764 --> 34:47.126
Where would you have gone?

34:47.827 --> 34:48.808
After who?

34:49.329 --> 34:50.451
I would have worked backwards.

34:53.035 --> 35:03.690
We have a hole in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century, the first ten years of the twentieth century, the whole period of the realists and naturalists.

35:03.710 --> 35:06.534
That's what Patrick was saying, that there's a crane collection.

35:06.554 --> 35:07.636
I would have worked backwards.

35:07.756 --> 35:09.879
I would have worked backwards.

35:10.620 --> 35:13.324
I did have a superb crane collection.

35:13.777 --> 35:18.621
and the university had no interest in it, and I sold it at auction at Swan.

35:20.403 --> 35:20.483
Hmm.

35:20.503 --> 35:20.904
Too bad.

35:21.344 --> 35:22.105
Yes, too bad.

35:22.125 --> 35:22.725
I wish I had.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.027
I had a Maggie.

35:24.047 --> 35:25.248
Oh, Maggie for all the streets.

35:25.548 --> 35:28.050
I did my senior thesis on Crane at Bates.

35:28.070 --> 35:28.451
Good for you.

35:31.073 --> 35:39.401
But in Journalist, that's one of which traces journalism, the impact of his journal, well, out of Imperfect, whether there's nothing at Bates.

35:39.621 --> 35:41.843
I worked with Fred Bowers on the Crane edition.

35:42.886 --> 35:45.229
Sure.

35:45.249 --> 35:51.917
I was respectful of Crane before we began, and I came out of it even more respectful of Crane.

35:53.599 --> 35:55.882
He burned himself up, though, didn't he, at the age of 29.

35:55.942 --> 35:58.225
There was tuberculosis.

35:58.565 --> 36:00.768
Well, the demon rub, too, didn't help.

36:00.788 --> 36:01.188
No.

36:02.390 --> 36:06.875
There's no record of Crane being an alcoholic.

36:06.895 --> 36:12.522
He drank, but no record at all of alcoholism.

36:13.261 --> 36:14.162
It was TB.

36:14.362 --> 36:14.703
TB.

36:15.964 --> 36:16.305
Okay.

36:17.747 --> 36:20.931
Listen, Patrick's got to take me back because I have to get changed.

36:22.913 --> 36:27.059
War One collection is... It's named for my father.

36:27.099 --> 36:31.945
So therefore, it has a special meaning for me.

36:31.965 --> 36:33.867
And what started you on that now?

36:33.887 --> 36:36.390
Is this a parallel... Crazy.

36:37.732 --> 36:43.099
When I was a child, on November 11th, every year that was,

36:43.568 --> 36:51.455
And my father used to take me to the parade with his medals pinned to my jacket.

36:52.756 --> 37:00.282
And when my father, he was very proud of his war record.

37:03.024 --> 37:04.366
He had a metal plate in his head.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.168
Came back from France, a metal plate in his head.

37:08.089 --> 37:13.153
And when he died in the year 1965,

37:14.618 --> 37:43.697
I went to Mr. Wyllie, and I said I wanted to do a memorial for my father, and Mr. Wyllie and I planned the Joseph M. Brookley Great War Collection at the University of Virginia, and after Mr. Wyllie subsequently died, and after enduring the ingratitude, the insults, and the abuse of his successors,

37:44.302 --> 37:54.352
I attempted to buy back the collection that I had given to Virginia to give it to South Carolina.

37:54.853 --> 38:14.072
And, of course, the president of the University of Virginia said, out of the question, and, of course, being what I am, I said, all right, you son of a bitch, I am going to build a far greater, far more valuable World War I collection named for my father

38:14.491 --> 38:16.233
at the University of South Carolina.

38:17.134 --> 38:25.564
So my father is the only man I've ever heard of who has two major collections in the same field named for him.

38:25.984 --> 38:26.465
That's great.

38:26.685 --> 38:28.407
The one here is better than the one in Virginia.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.071
Well, wouldn't it be nice if you could unite them?

38:32.251 --> 38:33.072
Does it replicate?

38:33.092 --> 38:33.473
I tried.

38:33.993 --> 38:34.474
I tried.

38:34.494 --> 38:36.937
Is it replicative?

38:37.197 --> 38:38.238
Not a hell of a lot.

38:38.258 --> 38:39.440
Inevitably, you know.

38:39.460 --> 38:42.523
Obviously, there are going to be some essential overlaps.

38:42.993 --> 39:10.941
surprisingly little overlap, and this collection is already better, richer than the Virginia collection, and if I can manage not to die for ten years, I think I'll have a

39:11.292 --> 39:15.418
A fair claim to saying it's the best World War I collection in America.

39:18.021 --> 39:19.584
Amazing how much stuff is out there.

39:19.804 --> 39:23.729
And this is stuff, obviously, such, is it all graphic stuff?

39:23.749 --> 39:24.551
Is it all graphic stuff?

39:24.571 --> 39:24.711
No, no.

39:24.731 --> 39:36.287
So, it's artifactual, and... You know, we have 135 posters, and, you know, the posters are eye-catching, but mainly it's the literature of World War I.

39:36.470 --> 39:42.779
especially the poetry of World War I. The poor bastards wrote poems in the trenches and died the next day.

39:44.422 --> 39:45.283
Now, are we talking about?

39:46.004 --> 39:46.725
British and American.

39:46.745 --> 39:47.146
Yeah, British.

39:47.266 --> 39:47.987
Mostly British.

39:48.007 --> 39:49.189
Yeah, it has to be their poetry.

39:49.249 --> 39:50.410
Mostly British.

39:51.752 --> 39:59.464
A great deal of aviation literature was the first air war.

39:59.524 --> 40:03.650
Which must be very exciting stuff, yeah.

40:03.670 --> 40:05.953
You can't send that kid up in a crate like that.

40:06.389 --> 40:09.681
the immortal line from World War I picture.

40:10.323 --> 40:12.491
You can't send that kid up in a crate like that.

40:15.262 --> 40:17.008
Sir, thank you.

40:17.028 --> 40:17.791
Thank you for coming.

40:17.811 --> 40:18.373
Come on back.
