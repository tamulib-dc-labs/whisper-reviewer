00:03.490 --> 00:21.870
The design of what Iris Weinstein I've worked with on the last three books really.

00:21.850 --> 00:22.952
And she's terrific.

00:23.012 --> 00:24.995
I mean, it's not very good.

00:25.015 --> 00:29.784
If you want to be involved, I welcome you.

00:30.044 --> 00:36.696
And the first time I did this kind of complicated design book was New Bachelorette of Ritchie.

00:36.796 --> 00:39.741
And then if you could do very little, I could use it.

00:39.721 --> 00:48.073
Now Iris and I, really, we sat in front of the computer screen every time there was a page that might possibly be an illustration.

00:48.093 --> 00:51.838
We tried different patterns, different groupings, different sizes.

00:52.479 --> 00:58.468
We, you know, thought a lot about whether to run the text around or how deep the margins and gumpers were.

00:58.488 --> 00:59.870
So every page, really.

01:00.330 --> 01:05.678
I mean, she's, you know, I was just really given up a set of choices to make and tried to make it on her.

01:05.658 --> 01:07.942
She was really terrific.

01:08.122 --> 01:09.824
We've got these permissions.

01:09.845 --> 01:10.305
That's amazing.

01:10.325 --> 01:13.050
Thank God I hired my research system.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.176
Permissions, I mean, you could spend, you know, I did cheers.

01:17.196 --> 01:19.259
You know, you could do it with this myself.

01:19.279 --> 01:22.845
I mean, after two months ago, we only got about 40 pictures in there.

01:22.925 --> 01:23.025
Cool.

01:23.275 --> 01:34.167
My book is called A Gentle Magnus, and it's about bibliomania.

01:34.748 --> 01:41.415
Oh, I know you wrote about bibliophilia.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.056
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42.076 --> 01:42.597
We just closed it with me.

01:42.617 --> 01:45.080
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's weird.

01:45.220 --> 01:45.580
No, that's brutal.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.321
You know, so it's on France.

01:46.341 --> 01:47.763
Oh, we've got the blues, what they call the blues.

01:47.783 --> 01:48.343
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48.363 --> 01:50.466
And he called me, and he said, like, one of the books I've been asking this guy was to my editor.

01:50.486 --> 01:50.946
He's Alan Peacock.

01:50.966 --> 01:51.266
He's a big fan.

01:51.287 --> 01:51.747
He's an editor-in-host.

01:51.727 --> 02:15.456
In fact, I'm so impressed, one of the many things that you do is how much you use artifacts and all of your work.

02:15.436 --> 02:21.503
Well, again, it came out of a Dutch book.

02:22.104 --> 02:37.883
I mean, when I was doing what I conceived as an anti-political chair of daily life, it seems to be crazy and not to say because of visual culture and how I really, really seriously, but it's not just simply an illustration in the sense of

02:37.863 --> 02:56.479
supporting an algorithm you would make, a conclusion you would draw from textual documents that actually, you know, since images were everywhere, not just in paintings and prints, but on tiles and engraved glasses, painted furniture, painted tulips everywhere you would look,

02:56.459 --> 03:11.439
I thought, well, there may be something really which the object, you know, the kind of, you know, bric-a-brac applied to actually speak in a way which more formal doctrines could.

03:11.459 --> 03:20.872
So I then really tried to show myself as an architect historian, really, quite seriously, and spent a lot of time putting in the air, having really impossible German theory.

03:20.992 --> 03:24.677
As a historian, how do these things energize the work?

03:24.657 --> 03:32.387
Well, actually, it's rather like going... You know, you know you want to study books when you go to the library.

03:32.487 --> 03:37.634
And it's impressively, with any luck, like, you know, I do miss Widener Library in New York.

03:37.654 --> 03:43.341
It's the book next to the book you thought you were looking for that actually turns out is what you actually were looking for.

03:43.361 --> 03:44.903
That's why I love going to the start of Widener.

03:44.923 --> 03:45.404
Yeah, exactly.

03:45.504 --> 03:49.950
I think for one thing, it's like... I can't tell you how many times I have to meet this.

03:49.970 --> 03:51.492
So it's really...

03:51.472 --> 04:16.017
When you're working in great visual archives, you know, a terrific kind of archive, which are archival of the cinema as well as former films in Ireland, you know, that whole chapter about Standard Wales, you know, it's so startled to find in the list about, you know, 60, 70 films, all of Standard Wales was in a quite narrow time band.

04:16.457 --> 04:20.061
It wasn't that, you know, the tide suddenly shifted, but that they got obsessed with these things, really.

04:20.041 --> 04:35.335
basis to the object of nature and is taught to do it, and it's good enough in a way to, you know, the inscription of nature, something that they deal with Russian history, of obsession.

04:35.355 --> 04:36.818
It's kind of irrational, actually, looking like Dutch promoting it.

04:36.798 --> 04:43.927
you know, organised, rational, optimising, utilitarian culture.

04:43.947 --> 04:48.412
And I thought, no, no, no, you know, Voltaire didn't call Holland China for nothing.

04:48.473 --> 04:50.896
It had underlying strangeness and oddity and obliqueness to the world.

04:50.916 --> 04:55.381
And it enounced itself in that kind of material.

04:55.641 --> 04:58.785
Are you fascinated by obsessions?

04:58.805 --> 04:59.066
Yes, yes.

04:59.086 --> 05:04.012
That whole book of obsessions... Oh, is that right?

05:04.112 --> 05:06.535
I'm going to take my jacket off, actually.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.041
The title of my book was Drinking Madness.

05:09.101 --> 05:24.034
The first time I dared talk about the whale thing was actually in Bruce Maslitch's seminar at MIT, which is kind of on irrationality, irrationality in history.

05:24.014 --> 05:32.085
Because he's interested in psychohistory and in psychology, and he's the only fellow of his kind.

05:32.425 --> 05:36.430
So, yeah, no, I tell you, it goes back a long way.

05:36.531 --> 05:40.676
You know my favourite book about the obsession with books?

05:40.696 --> 05:45.923
I don't know if it's yours, actually, which I read when I was about 12, was Carnessie's Orme d'Affé.

05:45.943 --> 05:46.764
Oh, it is, yeah.

05:46.784 --> 05:48.767
I mean, it's just a stunning book, actually.

05:48.787 --> 05:50.008
The first chapter I saw about the literature.

05:50.028 --> 05:50.189
Right.

05:50.209 --> 05:51.270
The best book.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.635
That's Peter Klein, A-I-E-I, the professor.

05:54.996 --> 05:56.498
He learns himself.

05:56.659 --> 05:57.260
Oh, God.

05:57.440 --> 05:57.640
Right.

05:57.660 --> 05:58.642
He's got that.

05:59.043 --> 05:59.784
This woman.

05:59.824 --> 06:02.668
The woman was a broad scum.

06:02.729 --> 06:03.690
What's so funny?

06:03.710 --> 06:06.575
What's amazing about that book is people don't realize that.

06:06.735 --> 06:07.757
No, he never read it.

06:07.777 --> 06:08.298
He thought about it again.

06:08.318 --> 06:09.019
I mean, it's not all good.

06:09.039 --> 06:14.187
He then became a historian on the session in Clouds and Powers, really, again, about the...

06:14.167 --> 06:21.176
I can't tell you how anxious I was just now when you said your favourite hook-up session.

06:21.236 --> 06:26.664
I said, oh my God, he's going to name something I don't know.

06:26.764 --> 06:30.128
You know, how you're sitting there, that kind of thing.

06:30.148 --> 06:30.649
I've seen it.

06:30.669 --> 06:31.430
I'm sad.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.853
I'm with Chris Lyson just before you.

06:33.913 --> 06:36.597
And now Simon Sharma, the man who knows everything.

06:36.577 --> 06:45.867
It's totally unfair, and it's very unfair that the lads on my hair is made for me.

06:45.967 --> 06:47.448
In fact, I have to also name the road.

06:47.468 --> 06:57.038
And then the balance is ending, you know, the answer to the crime is what it is.

06:57.058 --> 06:57.839
Actually, my screen is so brilliant.

06:57.859 --> 07:00.542
I'm pretty sure it's an old screen, and I'll send Diane's possession of this magazine.

07:00.522 --> 07:06.331
A wonderful boat, yeah.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.595
A wonderful boat.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.359
It did in a bit with that seminar called Brian Swift.

07:11.379 --> 07:11.759
You know, Brian?

07:11.780 --> 07:12.220
Yeah, yeah.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.242
Waterland is terrific.

07:13.322 --> 07:18.109
And Brian was, while Antonio Barrett was doing that work, where on the trussies is laughing as they're after.

07:18.129 --> 07:20.874
And he takes up anything like as good as a science book.

07:20.994 --> 07:23.037
But it's also about kind of hunts for a particular loft.

07:23.017 --> 07:32.495
It's called Ever After, but it's more about actually Darwin and what happens to Yad Vicar when he starts to make Darwin's bear clear.

07:32.575 --> 07:36.503
Well, only to be embarrassed with the witch's tree, and I never got it in.

07:37.512 --> 07:43.619
I wanted to mention the tulip media.

07:43.660 --> 07:46.183
That was extraordinary.

07:46.563 --> 07:50.147
People don't even believe that.

07:50.268 --> 07:51.870
We couldn't mention that it was so crazy over tulip.

07:51.950 --> 07:57.917
What I try to do is trace book media goes back 25 centuries.

07:57.897 --> 08:07.411
Did you saw the picture again of the xylopeg in a Rosamund Patel picture?

08:07.431 --> 08:11.718
I knew about it, I only known him for photographing.

08:11.818 --> 08:14.041
I met Rosamund for Steve J. Gould and said, oh, I've got these things.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.665
Oh, you went up to Farnaca, which is a dream of course.

08:16.645 --> 08:27.962
Lend me that, but I've never actually told one of these things.

08:27.982 --> 08:30.926
They're quite, yeah, they're fun in France.

08:31.006 --> 08:32.929
They were a German expression to try to try.

08:32.949 --> 08:37.556
Catherine the Great was very interested in silo-fakes and, you know, wood books and ordered some and had them in her library.

08:37.576 --> 08:38.658
Catherine the Great had a terrific silo-fake.

08:38.678 --> 08:41.362
Stephen and I are a really nice book I've collected.

08:41.382 --> 08:41.802
It's quite fantastic.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.383
It's called, yeah, yeah.

08:42.363 --> 08:56.188
Yeah, but as a partner with Rosamund herself, she's an astonishing photographer, and I think she's not well enough.

08:56.228 --> 09:03.681
Yeah, you saw that last book they did that begins with that terrifying collection of babies.

09:03.781 --> 09:04.843
Wasn't that amazing?

09:04.823 --> 09:09.931
Because I knew there's a painting, actually, of what he called the doctor who did those things.

09:09.971 --> 09:14.457
And it's actually the last painting in the anatomy lesson tradition that we had.

09:14.738 --> 09:17.662
And he's actually anatomising a dead baby.

09:17.863 --> 09:25.194
And his own son, the anatomy prior-elect's son, is standing there paying attention to his father.

09:25.294 --> 09:28.699
And the son is pointing to a skeleton.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.882
It's a very complicated business of sound instructing.

09:30.862 --> 09:43.117
the surviving son in issues of anatomy and mortality.

09:43.137 --> 09:45.660
It's really true here.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.968
But he was that doctor who, I had no idea that he had this gigantic collection of elaborately dressed and bejeweled and it's kind of a thing.

09:51.988 --> 09:52.508
Terrible.

09:52.528 --> 09:56.814
When I came back at the Georgia Club in New York, who looks like Steven was on the same... somewhere.

09:56.834 --> 09:57.915
He gave the opening and I gave the ending, you know.

09:58.553 --> 10:08.603
He talks about books that he has used, how they have helped him in his life.

10:08.743 --> 10:12.394
He lives in New York.

10:12.695 --> 10:18.085
This is quite a book.

10:19.006 --> 10:26.240
I have to say, Susan is one of my very favorite books.

10:26.260 --> 10:29.826
I guess I wonder how having produced this book which is acknowledged to be a classic.

10:29.806 --> 10:32.554
Oh, is it intimidating to follow?

10:32.794 --> 10:33.797
Yes, it is.

10:34.299 --> 10:38.731
I mean, actually, it's really, I wrote after I started last day.

10:38.751 --> 10:39.914
I thought it was a wonderful place.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.759
That's not nearly as I mentioned.

10:41.780 --> 10:42.221
Exactly, no, no.

10:42.241 --> 10:43.444
But it was, that was just kind of vacation for a while.

10:43.464 --> 10:44.547
I wrote it in two months.

10:44.567 --> 10:44.828
Three months.

10:44.808 --> 11:02.476
But this, in a way, I mean, sometimes I don't want to do a piece of narrative history, but I have actually very specific narrative history in mind, which would be the book After Next, which would be very sort of citizen-like in its structure and style over time.

11:02.496 --> 11:09.347
But I did want to, in this book, it was sort of unfinished, for instance, when I was reading it again.

11:09.327 --> 11:25.108
from that third chapter about something called the fear of drowning and you know just about the way the Dutch at the same time that they're taking dry land from wet they're physically establishing their own place to live they're also culturally establishing their own identity again to

11:25.088 --> 11:49.898
So I thought to myself, well, you know, I want to take that kind of issue further.

11:50.097 --> 11:53.320
But I wanted to do it in an opposite way.

11:53.921 --> 12:11.959
I wanted to talk about a kind of idea of a homeland in which the point is not radical men's radical intervention, you know, kind of sovereign alteration, but it's something that knew as a world which has never been altered and that gives you your integrity and legitimacy.

12:11.979 --> 12:16.003
So I thought then about, you know, Germany as a move forward to my own evil.

12:15.983 --> 12:21.717
And then I started to sort of read lots of landscape history.

12:21.897 --> 12:31.039
And it was a book, really, where the argument about myths and tribal identity, about natural sense of where is home,

12:31.019 --> 12:36.525
was the kind of driving force that I knew there had to be stories in the United States.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.167
I only write books with stories.

12:38.187 --> 12:39.169
It was a hard book to write.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.732
Yeah, it was a hard book to write for this one.

12:41.752 --> 12:44.615
Yeah, because it was not led by the stories.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.778
No, no, the stories are very brilliant, so to speak.

12:46.798 --> 12:47.859
Yeah, that's right.

12:48.119 --> 12:57.330
So, I mean, it had to have a kind of class and character, sort of themselves, guardians and custodians and storytellers about the traditions that I described.

12:57.310 --> 13:06.368
So I think other books may be... I actually like the Grilled Tuna, if I could.

13:06.628 --> 13:13.041
I like it well done.

13:13.021 --> 13:22.771
It's just a faint pink inside, but not a rare.

13:23.112 --> 13:26.195
I know a lot of people love it and see it.

13:26.915 --> 13:27.676
Medium well?

13:28.337 --> 13:31.640
Medium well is good, yeah.

13:32.661 --> 13:36.425
They come with a little salad, or they come with a steak salad and put it on a plate.

13:36.445 --> 13:37.867
Fine, let's do it.

13:37.887 --> 13:38.367
It's a fun thing.

13:38.387 --> 13:38.908
I'd love to sell it.

13:38.928 --> 13:39.649
I'd love to sell it.

13:39.669 --> 13:41.270
I'd love to sell it.

13:41.290 --> 13:41.831
I'd love to sell it.

13:41.851 --> 13:42.792
I'd love to sell it.

13:43.733 --> 13:58.441
Yeah, so it was a sense in which, you know, Silicon Paddock really needed to share with one of the best sellers for about six months, you know, I mean, you can't, or at least I can't.

13:58.461 --> 14:05.775
I had a wonderful type of show, a fantastic editor, but my editor in class was another friend, and she believes, you know, you have to

14:05.755 --> 14:08.219
the books you might arrive.

14:08.239 --> 14:14.168
It has this kind of secret theory of, you know, the truck comes round the bend bearing your name and number on it.

14:14.368 --> 14:17.593
Or you say, damn, I ought to have written that.

14:17.613 --> 14:22.039
Not because of this part two, but I really, really ought to have written that.

14:22.059 --> 14:27.728
So, you know, speaking of obsessions, you know, you kind of unburden your obsession.

14:27.748 --> 14:29.130
But the kind of

14:30.697 --> 14:40.912
negotiation with a readership comes in one's care and pleasure in making the argument through the story rather than kind of lecturing.

14:41.233 --> 14:45.539
I mean, I beg to try not to do prose lectures.

14:45.559 --> 14:52.069
The introduction was a bit, I mean, that really was written many times.

14:52.189 --> 14:55.874
The introduction, it's not, you know, as detailed it is, it's not, it's from 15 pages.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.358
No, I know you're not there, no, no, but I'm saying it was

14:58.338 --> 15:04.827
You know, actually publishers on the app wanted to be longer, and I said, no, no.

15:04.847 --> 15:10.855
I wrote the introduction in a way, I mean, the introduction is actually the introduction.

15:11.376 --> 15:15.321
And then the whole of the Polish story is a kind of introduction.

15:15.341 --> 15:18.726
I wanted actually almost to begin the whole book with that Polish story.

15:18.706 --> 15:35.244
The publishers said, no, no, you need something more abstract to say, what kind of object is this that is weird enough to do.

15:35.264 --> 15:35.904
I think they were right.

15:35.924 --> 15:37.706
I'm sure they were right.

15:37.726 --> 15:38.567
I was happy to do this.

15:38.587 --> 15:40.830
You've used the word obsession now at least four times.

15:40.850 --> 15:41.831
I do truly describe it.

15:41.851 --> 15:42.491
You become obsessed with it.

15:42.512 --> 15:42.992
So is the hype.

15:42.972 --> 16:04.435
It was great playing with my family.

16:04.455 --> 16:06.617
And this work, I mean, you're going to have to classify this one and tell me what you were attempting to do.

16:06.637 --> 16:07.138
What you're reaching for.

16:07.158 --> 16:08.139
Reviewing the New York Times is very interesting.

16:08.159 --> 16:08.779
And you're developing a series?

16:08.799 --> 16:09.180
In the Daily Times.

16:09.200 --> 16:09.780
Yeah, that was a good review.

16:09.800 --> 16:10.822
You know what the most interesting review would be?

16:10.842 --> 16:11.642
You know, would be, of course, actually.

16:11.662 --> 16:12.203
You know, Washington Times.

16:12.655 --> 16:21.486
You know, they have a very, you know, you know his stuff too.

16:21.506 --> 16:24.931
Yeah, you know, so incredibly on the ball, on the ground.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.773
That is what I was doing.

16:26.793 --> 16:29.356
Yeah, let me ask you a question first.

16:29.416 --> 16:30.618
If you're anywhere you want.

16:30.638 --> 16:36.165
No, I mean, you're aware, even when you take your time off, you're kind of in a grip of, you know,

16:36.145 --> 16:51.522
of the obsession, and you're constantly going to clarify to yourself what it is, and also I did this book as live television films for the BBC, so actually I hope that I'm going to guarantee you that the TVS will take.

16:51.502 --> 17:04.807
But when you do, when you rewrite them all over again on the television screen, I write the shots as well as, you have to forget you've written the book actually, because if you just simply write the shots as though they're illustrating, it just comes out again as a kind of lecture.

17:04.827 --> 17:08.234
So that's another opportunity to say, well, what is it I mean here?

17:08.254 --> 17:10.017
That's almost a sound bite too, isn't it?

17:09.997 --> 17:12.702
It's really hard, totally hard.

17:12.722 --> 17:15.547
The result isn't too shameful.

17:15.727 --> 17:24.201
I was in the Jerusalem Book Fair, about a couple of months ago, and walking around, you have my home.

17:24.221 --> 17:25.804
Something I hadn't seen ever, really.

17:25.824 --> 17:31.193
You know, Moshe Sassi did a beautiful memorial of children and children.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.878
And they're the entrance to that particular building.

17:33.858 --> 17:44.452
It was a maple tree, a cutting from a maple tree, taken from Theresienstadt, from Theresienstadt, from Theresienstadt.

17:44.512 --> 17:49.279
That was her at Highest Road in that field.

17:49.299 --> 17:51.001
And it was, now it gets better as it all works.

17:51.321 --> 17:56.048
It was planted in Theresienstadt by a schoolteacher, who was first in the Jewish New Year of the Tree in 1944, by her and her to be large.

17:56.068 --> 17:59.933
Now that the class told her to survive, that the tree survives, and then a couple of years ago,

17:59.913 --> 18:07.051
Nothing would take them, and take them to Yad Vashem.

18:07.071 --> 18:11.583
And I thought, you know, you mustn't be incurring at us in your session.

18:11.763 --> 18:14.771
Especially in a place where, you know, your book is the least important thing around here.

18:14.791 --> 18:15.272
But it did seem to me...

18:15.252 --> 18:21.978
a realistic instance of, you know, using the cycle of nature's consolation of the birth of the planet.

18:21.998 --> 18:35.930
Do you feel... No, no, that was really... I thought the same was true even in his non-scale way of, you know, Bill Clinton the other day putting a tree of white habitat, you know, to stuff that little... Do you feel the vibrations?

18:35.950 --> 18:39.934
Do you feel things... This book, more than any I've found... Yeah, absolutely.

18:39.954 --> 18:44.398
Yeah, the whole book was so totally better, I think, and there's more of my...

18:44.378 --> 19:08.023
In the first place it was kind of a book and a project and an argument, a thesis, and I kept on having these experiences, partly because of going to my, you know, Great Gas Party as well, but not just because of that, some seemingly things are rippling for me, and certainly in a place I find, you know, I don't know what it is, you know, places sort of cool as there is.

19:08.003 --> 19:24.797
I mean, even if I take the boat right now, we've got a little, you know, as Galera have, the ground drops down, they will shoot that before, you know, coming in the railway from Ohio and the boundary of the canal, made it impossible for those New England, New York fans to release me alive.

19:24.777 --> 19:31.950
And so there's dry stone walls still there and they've been covered by second-grade forest, maintenance, second-grade forest.

19:32.030 --> 19:36.899
But that's habitation, you know, a line of human habitation in the heart of something.

19:36.919 --> 19:39.083
I mean, it's all the wrong way around.

19:39.163 --> 19:40.646
It makes it so wonderful.

19:40.726 --> 19:43.711
First you're supposed to have wilderness and then you're supposed to have habitation.

19:43.732 --> 19:45.655
Here you have habitation and then you have wilderness.

19:45.888 --> 20:01.664
like Cemetery in Poland, you know, and that I find incredibly interesting.

20:01.684 --> 20:09.512
I remember reading of you, you spent some time with Coral in the book, and it was a pretty nice biography of him a few years ago, and I remember interviewing the guy out of Walden, you know what?

20:09.532 --> 20:10.213
Not Edward Holden?

20:10.233 --> 20:11.254
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:11.234 --> 20:25.655
I don't remember any of your eyes.

20:25.675 --> 20:26.917
There was great writing on that.

20:26.937 --> 20:30.122
And I remember I did the interview with him.

20:30.142 --> 20:32.545
We met him all the way, and we walked around.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.989
So when you were describing these themes, my own discovery of it, and this feeling of place of actually being there.

20:35.009 --> 20:35.790
But I'm wondering, in a book like this,

20:35.770 --> 20:46.056
So many works of history, you just come with baggage, you just come with a piece of love, you have an idea of where you look.

20:46.077 --> 20:48.362
This just sounds to me like it's an explanation.

20:48.443 --> 20:52.513
There are two arguments to any prior life.

20:52.493 --> 21:08.701
One was an attempt to argue with, you know, deep ecologists, with radical greens.

21:08.721 --> 21:16.594
I'm a green, I mean, I'm an environmentalist, but I'm not the kind of environmentalist which sees things as engaging me for war the whole time.

21:16.574 --> 21:33.992
One, I wanted to say, well, even though technology and corporate capital and the whole history of the West and the Left and the Europe have made it a struggle, you know, make one feel one's sort of held hostage, really, by the damage we can do.

21:33.972 --> 21:37.537
That is not the entire story that needs to be told.

21:37.897 --> 21:44.866
You read, you know, austerity, as they say, after austerity on the history of environmentalism, and as they teach environmentalism in India.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.689
It's all about guilt.

21:46.709 --> 21:56.662
It's all about, actually, all we've done in the West is treat nature, we've kicked it, said, feed me, work me over, develop me, bye-bye, on to the next day.

21:56.942 --> 22:00.086
Well, no, that's absolutely not the whole story.

22:00.106 --> 22:02.950
And the other story is indeed, you know, it's about...

22:03.335 --> 22:09.626
There's a strong kind of Arcadian impact.

22:09.646 --> 22:22.288
The oddity is that environmentalism wouldn't exist but for people like John Merle and Thoreau and Ruskin and people who were kind of overwhelmed by precisely the opposite impulse.

22:22.268 --> 22:26.495
A wrestling match between these two instances, really.

22:26.515 --> 22:38.415
Look, a hundred years ago, Theodore Roosevelt and Power, working with Gifford Fincher, not at all manages to take a hundred and twenty million acres out of commercial value of the government.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.879
It's almost a great Republican administration.

22:40.899 --> 22:41.560
Different kind of albums?

22:41.540 --> 22:45.325
It wasn't a kind of retort in that.

22:45.345 --> 22:55.317
It really just wanted to sort of speak to the kind of braving together of history and nature.

22:55.457 --> 23:00.163
And the other crucial issue is I felt that these mythic traditions had a very, very long history.

23:00.303 --> 23:03.967
They mutate and change and evolve.

23:03.987 --> 23:07.952
I guess it's when I realized that grungy hill of Waterbury, Connecticut was actually a sacrivoxie.

23:08.489 --> 23:15.924
You know, it doubted me it was.

23:15.944 --> 23:23.218
But oh my god, even in the kind of generally redmond in sort of industrial America, it's extraordinary storage.

23:23.238 --> 23:27.607
I've learned American, I'm just reading this section, we've got Americans, we've got our own here, it's been 25,000 years old.

23:27.627 --> 23:29.130
But again, they're still in our school.

23:29.600 --> 23:50.720
I was, you know, the reason I did the Albert Barber story is that the guy was very moved by his sort of medical background, but also that he built his reputation.

23:50.740 --> 23:58.847
I mean, one of the writers who's most known to me is the author of Erwin Panofsky, who you know about, but Albert, Albert Barber, this little kind of Jewish popular term,

23:58.827 --> 24:21.366
I'm interested in the long round of images, discovered that in the heart of what we think of as graceful, liberated, what you see is what you go at Renichal's painting, Patricelli's Primavera, you know, it just seems to be a kind of delicate grand celebration of commerce.

24:21.386 --> 24:23.890
This kind of ancient, demonic demiurge, this kind of flattering, great gesture,

24:23.870 --> 24:27.473
come from, as it were, the dark side of that.

24:27.493 --> 24:47.130
It comes from the sort of, this kind of extraordinary gate crashing into the world of technology and reason and utility of the kind of primitive past that is incredibly annoying.

24:47.150 --> 24:51.053
Sometimes it works out for good, sometimes it doesn't, as in the case of the Third Reich.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.455
But generally, do you have a view of history that, as you would say,

24:53.435 --> 25:09.898
You can go anywhere you want with it.

25:09.918 --> 25:12.422
It's almost easier to say that the basics

25:13.870 --> 25:20.821
By the way, that's training, right?

25:21.082 --> 25:25.529
Training science.

25:25.549 --> 25:25.709
Yeah.

25:26.491 --> 25:33.021
You know, the basic programs that are set out for history, the triumph of the West, liberal capitalism, the failure of Marxism.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.946
Those were always, to me, it's very odd, really, kind of seeing explanations of the interest.

25:35.926 --> 25:40.196
History to me is a kind of exuberant mess, you know, really.

25:40.537 --> 25:47.293
It's a kind of human habitation which always spills out of any advanced design one has.

25:47.394 --> 25:51.724
It's not a terrible bit of recitation, you know.

25:51.704 --> 26:03.809
It's sort of... You know that little book he wrote called A Hedgehog on the Frogs, really, and I've been accused of being very foxy, which is quite true.

26:04.009 --> 26:09.240
I believe in plenitude, in multiplicity and pluralism.

26:09.220 --> 26:16.469
So the history for me is a kind of, it's sort of a human escape from simplicity of order, really.

26:16.489 --> 26:30.688
You know, it's a kind of richness and populousness and unpredictability, it's that contingency of accidents, and sometimes the accidents are happy and sometimes are very unhappy, in the case of the state of contemporary religion.

26:31.023 --> 26:37.394
Go back specifically to this project.

26:37.414 --> 26:38.897
Did you have a goal?

26:38.917 --> 26:41.181
I mean, with citizens, you certainly have parameters.

26:41.201 --> 26:41.601
Right.

26:41.621 --> 26:42.803
Do you have the four corners?

26:43.284 --> 26:43.825
No.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.129
No, to be honest, I mean,

26:46.109 --> 26:55.440
I wanted to go through these three different types of symbolic worlds, you know, forest, rivers, and rock.

26:55.700 --> 27:09.616
They would defy, Arcadia I knew is much more written than that, you know, it's much more honest, but I thought rather that was zoo and forest walk and so on in ways I think they're sort of radically different.

27:09.636 --> 27:11.678
But these three overwhelming themes touched inside those

27:11.658 --> 27:29.170
One was the kind of war between civilisation, which always saw itself as vested in the streets and the squares of a castle temple, in other words, town civilisation, and its sort of terror of forest darkness as a kind of wild place.

27:29.371 --> 27:33.919
And that kind of dialectic, you know, that sort of dialogue between

27:33.899 --> 27:59.670
um you know newbury street and i don't know why i tried to find a wild place so the uh the first thing is a very important refrain really and the american and the english versus the kind of variants of the german so the notion of the first kind of alternative world the world of civility of law and engineering

27:59.650 --> 28:07.259
The second great theme was, you know, the analogy drawn by the Greeks between the blood circulating around our body and the river system.

28:07.840 --> 28:16.190
It mentioned there was a kind of mirror relationship between the laws governing the natural world and the laws governing human anatomy.

28:16.210 --> 28:21.417
And that's why I began that whole section with, um, how was the world governed by machinery or by magic?

28:21.777 --> 28:25.021
You resolve this, Joel Bartlett, you resolve everything, you know?

28:25.041 --> 28:28.105
And I believe he did it, you know, wonderful lessons from Harvard's library.

28:28.085 --> 28:34.573
But he did, you know, shut up in the cake house and I was saying, he was thinking those very big doors.

28:34.593 --> 28:42.782
So I wanted to talk about that, and into that I said the memory of the Nile, and the notion of the dismembered God, and sacrifice.

28:42.802 --> 28:47.068
There was plenty more, but to give you an example I left out.

28:47.088 --> 28:55.898
You know, I deeply wanted to write about death, and the traditional thinking about death in the Mississippi, literally I didn't turn out trying to get a pilot.

28:55.878 --> 29:04.711
I thought, God, you know, Trane is in Egypt, and then they're reading innocent broad.

29:04.731 --> 29:08.737
Wouldn't it be great if he wrote about the two themes and the two men to see that?

29:08.757 --> 29:10.099
But he's very boring on Egypt.

29:10.119 --> 29:11.301
It's the only... I adore him.

29:11.321 --> 29:16.729
I venerate him with no other writer, but his description of reading was... Oh, it's so feeble.

29:16.849 --> 29:18.171
Oh, it's staggeringly good.

29:18.351 --> 29:23.539
It's very dark, and, you know, it's terrifying.

29:23.519 --> 29:39.168
So I thought no to Lewis and Clark, we won't do, for example it had a marvellous moment, which again I think these were the outtakes.

29:39.869 --> 29:42.033
Do we have epipolous moments?

29:42.053 --> 29:46.742
Yeah, I think when I saw the copieres, well when I saw it outside Cracker,

29:46.722 --> 30:10.502
and it was a kind of burial mound of human artifacts that everybody assumed the form of a natural landscape the place of memory is actually something warped with our hands that is

30:10.482 --> 30:16.571
And what do you feel at that moment?

30:16.591 --> 30:17.914
A connection?

30:17.934 --> 30:19.977
Well, yeah, but it sounds so hokey.

30:19.997 --> 30:23.182
I mean, you feel... It's just an electrical connection, man.

30:23.202 --> 30:27.488
You feel... It's not an electrical connection.

30:27.649 --> 30:29.031
You feel you've found the bridge.

30:29.051 --> 30:30.533
I mean, that's... You feel you've found it.

30:30.513 --> 30:33.678
By indirect means, you stumble.

30:33.939 --> 30:46.859
If I manage to tell the truth anyway, it's always a matter of, as we said, you know, the book next to the book, hitting your toe, saying, God, of course, you know, all of the books are sort of kind of ah-ha moments like that.

30:46.879 --> 30:52.729
This would be impossible, as you say, at the very end of the book, to talk about the outcomes of feet.

30:52.749 --> 30:53.911
I love that.

30:54.151 --> 30:57.837
For me, you cannot get the story on the telephone.

30:57.817 --> 31:06.071
I'm terribly passionate about the Civil War battlefield.

31:06.151 --> 31:18.272
I'm not against Disney America at all.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.876
Well, no, that's true.

31:21.896 --> 31:25.240
I hate the way they're sentimentalising.

31:25.381 --> 31:36.654
I was going to say, I did not want it there, because actually that would be the substitute for people walking and and all around us.

31:36.674 --> 31:38.997
It's overwhelming.

31:39.017 --> 31:40.499
It's wonderful the way it is.

31:41.020 --> 31:42.221
Right, exactly, exactly.

31:42.321 --> 31:43.382
No, exactly.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.386
Right, well that was why it was so...

31:46.805 --> 32:03.830
They're furious about it, furious about it, but they want to put it, you know, somewhere else.

32:04.151 --> 32:06.093
I don't know if the people didn't want to read it.

32:06.114 --> 32:08.277
I don't know if they made it.

32:08.797 --> 32:09.659
Oh, basically as well.

32:09.679 --> 32:12.543
Thrilled to have it if they'll just go to Ellison.

32:12.563 --> 32:13.524
No, there's so many places to have it.

32:13.545 --> 32:16.028
You're talking about the necessity of getting some storytelling.

32:16.048 --> 32:16.349
Yeah.

32:16.369 --> 32:16.609
I had ideas.

32:16.589 --> 32:39.981
But you certainly have a sense of who your reader is, and you must have a sense of who you are.

32:39.961 --> 32:42.210
I mean, this is serious.

32:42.231 --> 32:44.460
It's also intended to be accessible.

32:44.540 --> 32:46.428
I should just use the gap, would you like to?

32:46.569 --> 32:48.537
You know, because by time, it's way off.

32:49.006 --> 33:13.381
Just this week, I'm getting lots of really lovely letters, and between, you know, by the time you're ready to start actually writing the next book, you've kind of forgotten the book, because it's just a mixture of, you know, book launches, a mixture of egomania, and it's all sort of you, you, you.

33:13.401 --> 33:17.207
So you kind of forget the way you get connected when you go to reading, for example, just the other night in Chicago,

33:17.187 --> 33:37.277
giving a talk at the university, and two graduate students came up to me, and they're in public universities actually, and he said, my gosh, do they let you have this?

33:37.297 --> 33:39.060
I said, do they let you have this?

33:39.080 --> 33:41.283
I said, do they let you have this?

33:41.303 --> 33:43.667
You can remain graduate student, it's just a dangerous step.

33:44.086 --> 34:01.252
We just wanted you to know how much your writing is mentored as a kind of counter-example to the pressures to be in tech or the academic, to find a kind of perfectly acceptable.

34:01.272 --> 34:12.810
I was very lucky, I had a teacher in Jack Plum, and the man with the Archive of the Beast, Michael Richards, was a great historian of contemporary relations, a born, chaotic, brilliant writer, brilliant storyteller.

34:12.790 --> 34:16.317
these fantastic scripts of Richmond.

34:16.337 --> 34:22.769
And these people were outsiders, they came from old places, they came up through Oxford and Cambridge and the public period.

34:22.949 --> 34:33.268
And they had never supposed there was anything disgraceful about the marriage between history and Richmond, you know, that Russia would be, you know, disenfranchised with all that work.

34:33.289 --> 34:34.511
But they always liked each one as an undergraduate.

34:34.711 --> 34:35.693
He'd spend maybe half an hour

34:35.673 --> 34:40.341
looking over a single character.

34:40.361 --> 34:58.915
His assumption was that history writing would not endure, would not actually ever reach beyond the narrow circle of the academy unless really you imagined the kind of, you know, an audience you were trying to hold, you know, as if you were in front of a campfire.

34:58.935 --> 35:00.297
Theodore Zeldin, the historian actually,

35:01.019 --> 35:08.679
I'd come and have an interview with him before we did the review, which was a terrible idea, but in London.

35:08.699 --> 35:11.787
And he's a wonderful fellow, Delving, and he really is terrific.

35:11.807 --> 35:15.838
He's just written a book called The Intellect History of Humanity.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.381
sweetly crazy and brilliant.

35:19.481 --> 35:23.650
He said to me, well, Simon, I know what you really wanted to be.

35:23.670 --> 35:25.393
He said you wanted to be a storyteller in a medieval marketplace.

35:25.834 --> 35:29.842
And I said, well, Theodore, it's never occurred to me before.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.207
I didn't find anything shameful.

35:32.187 --> 35:38.966
But he meant it totally generously, totally generously.

35:39.146 --> 35:45.223
Well, it's actually to instruct where people, to instruct with that cane.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.209
It's the mandate, I tell you, Nick,

35:47.189 --> 36:08.194
The sense is to make people, when they're reading the book, or they're inside one of the stories, or in the case of citizens, like the whole story, is for a short time, before they go to burial, or in burial, or whenever they're reading it, to put them in another world which is as immediate, as vivid, as, you know, briefly real as it possibly can be.

36:08.294 --> 36:11.578
That's what the calling told us, which is what Nietzsche said we should do.

36:11.698 --> 36:15.222
You know, breaking bread with the dead, make the dead live again.

36:15.202 --> 36:28.068
And I mean, all, I think, Chinese historical writers, as there are many, have this sort of greedy and patient with the kind of thinness of their own world, contemporary world.

36:28.088 --> 36:30.312
I've never been able to understand people who do this.

36:30.332 --> 36:31.675
I've admired them.

36:31.655 --> 36:42.276
For people who do the history of the last 20 years, how we got to where we are now, I sort of feel that you do wonderful work, but you lead an impoverished life.

36:42.316 --> 36:44.901
What about the 11th century?

36:44.941 --> 36:48.027
And I tried that on, you know.

36:48.007 --> 37:00.379
That's not one thousand, so if you get that right at all, then you manage to make people, you can bring them into contact with serious and difficult questions while they're in this kind of trial.

37:00.419 --> 37:04.851
There's one person who wrote to me, I've never forgotten, writes to me from time to time.

37:04.831 --> 37:08.476
from the Nana Baking Company in St.

37:08.496 --> 37:08.616
Louis.

37:08.857 --> 37:10.299
She's called Diane Rancatura.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.965
And she's the sister... She's Toscanini's Ice Cream.

37:15.185 --> 37:16.347
Toscanini's Ice Cream.

37:16.427 --> 37:17.328
Okay.

37:17.389 --> 37:23.577
A great, I think, Charlestown or... Anyway, she's the sister.

37:23.597 --> 37:28.784
She wrote to me from the baking company, the Nana Baking Company, after written Citizens.

37:28.804 --> 37:32.830
And she literally kind of read it while, you know, operating the dough machine.

37:32.810 --> 37:39.537
and she'd have it in her, she'd describe herself having it in her left hand and making sure the dough came out of my right.

37:39.557 --> 37:48.727
She wrote to me as absolutely as though Mirabeau was still alive and, you know, Madame Lecoultre Canne was still running her farm in Connecticut.

37:48.807 --> 37:58.918
And it was wonderful, totally, you know, barely finished high school, no college education, complete for auto attacks, really.

37:58.898 --> 38:03.762
You know, if I think, well, who would I want to read this?

38:03.983 --> 38:06.365
I think of her and people like her, really.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.787
So you do want to read her a moment?

38:08.807 --> 38:10.849
Not when you're actually in the act of writing.

38:10.869 --> 38:13.211
When you're in the act of revising, I do.

38:13.451 --> 38:17.295
You get to the end of the day, you have it within you to write for your poems.

38:17.315 --> 38:17.395
Yes.

38:17.415 --> 38:19.657
So they're exploiting the other end of the day.

38:19.977 --> 38:26.003
You know, I think, now I'm too old to really... So, yeah, I mean, I did, for example, the book was more...

38:25.983 --> 38:29.510
I've written it three times.

38:29.530 --> 38:32.295
The first time was those lecturers that came to university.

38:32.316 --> 38:34.059
And there are multiple problems.

38:34.079 --> 38:40.031
I was actually delivering these lectures in front of people who had told me 30 years ago.

38:40.271 --> 38:44.219
I was shaking in my shoes, I promise you.

38:44.359 --> 38:45.842
You're judging me, aren't you?

38:45.862 --> 38:47.265
Absolutely.

38:47.245 --> 38:50.670
Um, and then, you know, oh, smoke and mirrors.

38:50.730 --> 38:51.591
Actually, it was wonderful.

38:51.611 --> 39:04.389
One of the English interviews, an anonymous Oxford historian was quoted, on condition of anonymity, surprise, surprise, in Oxford, not Cameron, saying, oh, Shana, stuntman, total show.

39:04.409 --> 39:08.655
Actually, I thought, well, he's probably right, actually.

39:08.855 --> 39:17.067
But that was the sense in which, you know, I do impermissibly, I don't know, you know, kind of imaginative or flamboyant things, whatever it is, but...

39:17.047 --> 39:27.046
But actually, yes, I do write, I still do write, you know, perfectly serious scholarly articles, I think.

39:27.066 --> 39:31.534
But, you know, you have a responsible job, your day job is teaching you, you know?

39:31.554 --> 39:35.562
Well, that's what I almost think is my next question.

39:36.014 --> 39:45.836
Did you begin your professional career as a writer?

39:45.856 --> 39:47.239
Good question, but the fact is,

39:47.675 --> 39:56.871
I got one of these kind of baby professor jobs, you know, just after I graduated, you could do this in the year of 1966.

39:56.992 --> 39:57.673
Long time ago.

39:57.813 --> 40:04.966
In those days in Oxford and Cambridge, if you did well in your exams, traditional went back to the 1850s, you got a job.

40:05.086 --> 40:07.651
I was paid £800, £1,000 a year, pretty much.

40:07.791 --> 40:09.514
You know, that was my salary.

40:09.697 --> 40:12.360
And you're transformed and loving.

40:12.380 --> 40:16.023
And once you do it, it's not enough to be undergraduates.

40:16.143 --> 40:19.967
Everything's from Charlemagne to Winston Churchill, and that again.

40:19.987 --> 40:28.255
And there's nothing I was not supposed to do in the crowd for tea.

40:28.455 --> 40:31.438
It was really, you know, foreign to the world.

40:31.458 --> 40:33.299
And you're sort of a little surprised at being this.

40:33.320 --> 40:37.003
So if you didn't have a real appetite for teaching, you're in trouble.

40:36.983 --> 40:41.530
I always, for me, writing was the power of the exercise, really.

40:41.550 --> 40:43.893
But I do enjoy teaching.

40:44.034 --> 40:45.656
I always enjoyed lecturing.

40:45.676 --> 40:57.794
My father was a great kind of hand actor, not professionally, but he was a sort of disappointed chairman, really, who went into textiles, you know, before the journey was very funny.

40:57.814 --> 41:06.147
But he continued to be a great kind of producer of very classy amateur Shakespeare, everything from vaudeville to Shakespeare.

41:06.582 --> 41:10.870
He put me on my feet and, you know, said, the Jew's only real weapon is a mouse.

41:10.970 --> 41:12.432
I'm not sure it's necessarily true.

41:12.933 --> 41:17.461
But, you know, he made me do circuits in public speaking and debating.

41:17.481 --> 41:19.725
He worked for the theater all the time.

41:20.206 --> 41:22.891
And he was a great teacher in his way.

41:22.911 --> 41:27.058
He was my own father instead of a teacher.

41:27.118 --> 41:30.885
Now, I don't know about the works in progress or what you have planned, but let me also ask.

41:31.945 --> 41:50.547
You know, you look at Francis Clark when he's the historian of America, and you think of Gibbon and Malone, and you think of Dumas Malone, a lovely biography.

41:50.567 --> 41:54.251
So, how do you see yourself as producing a corpus of related things?

41:54.271 --> 42:01.800
Well, they're all about, they're all about, I mean, no, I mean, I really, there'll be a corpus in front of me, apparently, I don't know what they should say, but they're all about.

42:01.780 --> 42:22.658
even i say in the case of the citizens really not the case that was a diversion i wanted to call it an entertainment no no no i want literally i told it was like a novel yes i said i want you to call it

42:22.638 --> 42:28.131
It's underneath the title, it should say, an entertainer with apologies to Graham Greene.

42:28.192 --> 42:30.738
Actually, that's a song that they should have.

42:31.119 --> 42:32.402
Yes, they bloody well should have.

42:32.422 --> 42:35.089
Yeah, there's been a lot of stories, nothing at all.

42:35.109 --> 42:38.537
Anyway, the rest have really all been about...

42:38.517 --> 42:50.688
you know, what I call tribal identity, about kind of the way in which cultures, in particular times, have sort of asserted, who are we and where do we go from here?

42:50.708 --> 43:06.162
I mean, well, there was sort of French trying to radically turn themselves upside down and inside out in order, as Harry insisted, in that book, to kind of rediscover Frenchies that had sort of been left under the absolutism of the old regime or the Dutch

43:06.142 --> 43:25.062
discovering involuntarily almost that they were a kind of distinct entity or you know the Rothschild book was about the peculiar kind of implantation against kind of French money and Polish views in Palestine and many of the books are really about that the next book I'm about to do actually however will not be about that

43:25.042 --> 43:26.604
There are books about Rembrandt.

43:26.685 --> 43:28.808
Oh, he's a collector.

43:28.848 --> 43:30.370
Yeah.

43:30.391 --> 43:32.213
Lots of books, though.

43:32.294 --> 43:36.861
It's very surprising to me, always, because he was so literary, actually.

43:37.141 --> 43:38.383
And he was proud of it.

43:38.403 --> 43:42.189
I mean, he was fairly happy to see his assets.

43:42.590 --> 43:45.495
Yeah, no, it was a thing called a sette abonora.

43:45.735 --> 43:48.940
It's a way of not paying...

43:48.920 --> 44:04.330
But the book after that, which I had, did I do?

44:04.681 --> 44:15.839
is about Hawaii, which I've been to many, many times and looked in the archives and have a little library about 19th century Hawaii.

44:15.919 --> 44:24.613
That'll be a book, it will mostly be about 19th century Hawaii, entirely about

44:25.302 --> 44:42.257
It's strange that Hawaii became American, and what kind of identity could Hawaii possibly have had in the 19th century, and the kind of collapse of the traditional monarchy.

44:42.297 --> 44:46.401
So that would be kind of a large, epic narrative that I imagine.

44:46.561 --> 44:53.908
I have to call out for under the overwhelming embrace of James Smith, and you have nothing to worry about.

44:55.289 --> 45:01.657
How many reviews, however, do you think you've got to do that?

45:01.677 --> 45:02.438
Oh, many, many.

45:02.458 --> 45:03.500
You must know this going in.

45:03.900 --> 45:04.301
Right, exactly.

45:04.321 --> 45:13.633
But on the other hand... There's a great writer who I really recommend to, called Gavin Dawes, who's Ross Taylor, in his late 50s, who writes brilliantly about why.

45:13.653 --> 45:15.195
In fact, it's struggling to me.

45:15.215 --> 45:17.398
Nobody else in America seems to be interesting.

45:17.418 --> 45:20.962
They see him, like, instead of writing a few kitsch.

45:20.982 --> 45:22.444
Not as a kind of great, tragic character.

45:22.424 --> 45:39.324
It's the most extreme case of, you know, I found it painful to write about England.

45:39.584 --> 45:44.770
Of course it is.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.909
I'd like to sort of do a stretch.

45:47.929 --> 45:56.970
I mean, I think I'd sort of work best and write best when I have to kind of reach towards another culture because I'm going to get put together.

45:57.090 --> 46:00.177
Oh, sure.
