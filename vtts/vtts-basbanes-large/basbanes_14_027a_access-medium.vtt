WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:03.838
Let's make sure it's starting.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.803
I always have to check it.

00:07.823 --> 00:08.243
There it is.

00:09.085 --> 00:10.086
Welcome to Penelope Fitzgerald.

00:11.447 --> 00:15.973
Well, thank you so much for agreeing to see us here on a Sunday afternoon.

00:15.993 --> 00:16.634
Well, you're welcome.

00:17.294 --> 00:19.097
Sorry it's such wretched weather.

00:19.117 --> 00:20.238
It's quite nice, actually.

00:20.618 --> 00:21.459
It's spring already.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.862
We were noticing the beautiful flowers on the way up.

00:24.944 --> 00:26.666
Tell us a little bit about Highgate.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.329
You've lived here quite a

00:29.630 --> 00:31.192
a good deal of your life, I believe.

00:31.212 --> 00:32.714
No, no, I haven't, no, no.

00:32.935 --> 00:49.017
I came here when my son-in-law and daughter got this house, and they then, this bit was actually, I think it was a garage, or it may have been a coach house, because it's older than it looks, it's house.

00:49.037 --> 00:52.662
And he made it into this little plant.

00:55.085 --> 00:58.590
I have to say, you have caused quite a sensation in the United States.

00:58.823 --> 01:05.174
Richard Eater believes that you're the greatest living English novelist.

01:05.194 --> 01:07.639
Well, they can't say fair enough, can they?

01:07.659 --> 01:09.802
And Richard Eater is one of our great critics.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.405
He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning critic.

01:11.585 --> 01:12.046
Yeah.

01:12.066 --> 01:14.350
It's a remarkable tribute.

01:14.851 --> 01:17.035
Well, I'm very grateful to him.

01:17.416 --> 01:18.698
He's a Boston man.

01:18.738 --> 01:19.439
Yes, he is.

01:19.459 --> 01:22.705
Yes, he is.

01:23.309 --> 01:33.625
Some of the pieces that have been written about you suggest that you've heard the phrase late bloomer, of course, in terms of, I guess your first novel was published when you were 60 years old.

01:34.567 --> 01:35.508
Yeah, that's quite right.

01:35.588 --> 01:38.453
I never was a young novelist.

01:38.473 --> 01:44.623
I rather, I missed that really, because I think it would be great to be a young writer, but no, I wasn't.

01:45.805 --> 01:50.532
Can you explain how it was at that point in your life you turned to fiction?

01:54.241 --> 01:56.224
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to think what did happen.

01:56.244 --> 02:01.391
I didn't start with fiction, I started with biography.

02:01.431 --> 02:18.735
And I started to write really because I got to a point in my life when my husband was very ill, he in fact died shortly afterwards, and I needed some money.

02:18.835 --> 02:24.062
And there were only two ways that I could earn money really, and that was teaching.

02:24.599 --> 02:34.252
And writing, I mean most people have got quite a few things they can turn to, you know, if need be, but I haven't really.

02:37.236 --> 02:46.168
And so I did start teaching and I also began writing.

02:51.211 --> 02:57.378
I'm trying to think why I started with Bern-Jones, but anyway, you don't really want to know about the biography.

02:57.398 --> 03:03.124
Well, actually I do, because when I said at this point in your life you turned a fiction, I do know that you did several biographies.

03:03.284 --> 03:09.131
One, a group biography, in fact, of your uncles and your father, and Bern-Jones as well.

03:09.151 --> 03:11.834
Yeah, well, I started with Bern-Jones, with the painter.

03:12.615 --> 03:20.323
And my grandfather was Bishop of Birmingham.

03:20.877 --> 03:23.261
And that too is where Berne Jones came from.

03:24.122 --> 03:31.513
And he did the wonderful West Windows in Birmingham Cathedral.

03:31.533 --> 03:32.855
Have you ever been to Birmingham?

03:33.095 --> 03:33.175
No.

03:33.216 --> 03:36.981
Well, actually, they're all being covered now with wire because people are so dreadful now.

03:37.001 --> 03:39.285
They throw stones and things when they see a window.

03:39.305 --> 03:39.645
That's terrible.

03:39.665 --> 03:46.375
So they've had to cover it with, I don't know what it is exactly, but anyway, it spores really the window.

03:47.116 --> 03:48.859
But anyway, I knew it.

03:49.143 --> 03:52.026
I'd known it all my life and I've always loved that window.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.370
And so I started to do this, this life of Burne Jones.

03:57.791 --> 04:16.568
After that I did a novel, which was supposed to be a thriller, but as a matter of fact it's not, the publisher thought it wasn't thrilling enough, so it was called a mystery story that doesn't imply any thrills, you know.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.559
That was The Golden Child.

04:18.599 --> 04:19.520
That was right.

04:20.121 --> 04:24.086
He cut out the last eight chapters, this publisher.

04:24.106 --> 04:27.631
I was very fond of him, but he said, oh, people don't want to read these long books.

04:28.492 --> 04:35.921
And so the last eight chapters are gone, and I think it makes it, but there are some ends left hanging in there as a result.

04:36.582 --> 04:43.091
But, you know, my husband, as I said, he was very ill, and I wanted to write something that would amuse him.

04:43.852 --> 04:45.694
Like all many, really, and he read...

04:46.737 --> 04:51.601
be detected in the mystery stories, left themselves, I think.

04:51.621 --> 04:52.742
That's what men do, even.

04:52.822 --> 04:56.986
It did abuse him, you know, so.

04:57.006 --> 05:00.990
It seems very old-fashioned now, but there you are.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.371
That was the first.

05:02.391 --> 05:05.134
Did you start with the character on that, or the mystery?

05:05.874 --> 05:15.563
No, that was actually, we had an exhibition of King Tutankhamen, you know, the treasures from the

05:16.640 --> 05:33.296
and they were in the British Museum, and it wasn't very well managed, in fact, very poorly, and there was a terrible queue outside, you know, people standing patiently night and day waiting, and that made me, that started it off for me.

05:36.979 --> 05:42.985
And when you got into the exhibition, the night was very low, and

05:43.522 --> 05:48.949
There's so much show, you really had to peer at the exhibits, and I thought, well, why have they put the lights so low?

05:48.989 --> 05:54.056
And I thought, well, maybe these things are not genuine, and they've had to keep the lights down.

05:54.076 --> 05:57.060
Because for an exhibition, normally you get a highlight.

05:57.660 --> 06:04.209
And so, you know, I thought, I thought of writing this mystery story.

06:05.791 --> 06:11.959
Well, it turns out, I understand this, but it turns out cryptology or the...

06:12.057 --> 06:14.240
Yes, yes, it did, yes.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.003
And this comes from your background, I think.

06:16.023 --> 06:23.213
Well, one of my uncles was, I suppose cryptologist is right.

06:23.874 --> 06:27.539
Anyway, he was, that's what he did.

06:27.559 --> 06:28.560
He deciphered things.

06:28.881 --> 06:32.887
That's what he did during both the World Wars, the 1st and 2nd.

06:32.907 --> 06:36.732
He worked both at the Admiralty, actually.

06:39.547 --> 06:44.795
It was very successful, actually, as a code-breaker.

06:45.376 --> 06:47.639
And you turned that into a mystery novel.

06:48.160 --> 06:55.691
Well, I didn't... I should have pretended that that was a code, but I was interested in codes because of my uncle.

06:59.277 --> 07:03.463
I understand that you draw from your life almost entirely throughout your fiction.

07:03.623 --> 07:04.925
You've lived on a houseboat.

07:04.945 --> 07:07.950
I think most people do, don't you?

07:08.268 --> 07:10.051
I think I did what most people do.

07:10.071 --> 07:16.440
That's the first novels I wrote were taken more or less from things I've experienced.

07:16.460 --> 07:29.699
And then after that, when you get to the end of your experience, or rather you get to the end of the things you want to write about, because some things you probably don't, well then you go outside it.

07:29.719 --> 07:31.522
And that's what I did.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.828
And there is a bookshop in your life, I understand.

07:36.230 --> 07:40.035
As a matter of fact, I believe it's closed now, which is a great sadness to me.

07:40.636 --> 07:43.479
It's at Southwold on the East Coast.

07:44.440 --> 07:51.429
And it was haunted.

07:53.993 --> 07:54.653
It really was.

07:54.894 --> 07:58.398
It was, I don't know whether you are haunted.

07:58.739 --> 08:03.465
There's a great difference between a ghost and a poltergeist.

08:03.605 --> 08:06.068
Could you explain the difference for us, please?

08:06.723 --> 08:34.249
Well, actually, I've seen a ghost, there is a ghost down there anyway, down in South Wales, of somebody who's, there's a crossing over the river, you know, a boat ferry, a rowboat ferry, and there's somebody who once missed the ferry, you know, you could see them waiting at the ferry sometimes.

08:34.583 --> 08:39.488
Now, that's what I call a ghost, and you have to choose whether to believe in it or not, really.

08:39.508 --> 08:49.858
But it's not necessarily even a frightening, it's a strange experience.

08:49.878 --> 08:56.665
But a poltergeist is definitely malicious and evil, and there's a great deal of evidence for them.

08:56.705 --> 09:00.189
There's whole books about them.

09:00.209 --> 09:04.573
But, I mean, I've never thought about one at all in connection with the shop.

09:05.043 --> 09:14.772
But it was run by a nice woman called Mrs. Neiman, and next door there was a shoe shop.

09:15.813 --> 09:21.038
And one day I said to Mrs. Neiman, there's a terrible noise in the shoe shop.

09:21.098 --> 09:23.481
I said, I thought it was shut, you know, Wednesday afternoon.

09:23.821 --> 09:26.343
There's a terrible tapping and wrapping.

09:26.363 --> 09:29.787
I've forgotten that people don't tap and wrap in shoe shops now.

09:29.807 --> 09:31.168
That's only in Disney.

09:31.188 --> 09:33.210
I mean, they don't mend shoes that way.

09:33.410 --> 09:50.918
But, you know, and I thought it was, and she said, don't say anything, otherwise the customers will hear it, because she was, and, but I didn't, then another time when I was there, after I was offered the shop, it definitely made its appearance.

09:51.359 --> 09:52.100
It made its appearance?

09:52.240 --> 09:57.308
Well, I didn't, no, it didn't appear, because I don't think they ever do with poltergeist, but I, um,

09:59.026 --> 10:06.938
They do something, because she didn't live over the shop, she lived across the river, but she had a room and everything you know about the shop.

10:06.958 --> 10:17.414
And we had, I was sitting there with my little daughter and I heard the carpet being dragged about, you know, and books being thrown on the floor.

10:18.916 --> 10:26.728
And I didn't go up there, but anyway, the next day I asked her, she went up and it was, the carpet was all up, you know, and the books.

10:26.869 --> 10:27.329
Oh, really?

10:27.590 --> 10:27.750
Yeah.

10:29.131 --> 10:47.853
And they're supposed to make their appearance, they're often brought on, work with young girls, you know, tricks in between girls, you know, just turning from being a child after being grown up.

10:49.294 --> 10:52.318
So perhaps it was, well anyway, so that was true.

10:52.358 --> 10:57.484
So I brought this into the book just as it stood.

10:58.747 --> 11:13.229
But making an artistic work out of it, that was the challenge, of course, making a novel, taking an experience of a bookstore, an experience with a poltergeist, and to actually fuse all of this into an artistic expression.

11:13.269 --> 11:15.873
Yeah, well, I don't know how writing is done.

11:15.893 --> 11:17.155
Do you write novels?

11:17.355 --> 11:18.156
I write nonfiction.

11:18.196 --> 11:21.682
I don't write novels.

11:21.702 --> 11:25.147
But it is quite an alchemic process, isn't it, in a way?

11:25.187 --> 11:28.011
And I guess the creative process is difficult to explain.

11:28.548 --> 11:31.931
Yes, particularly for me, because I write with pen and ink.

11:31.951 --> 11:34.374
I really think I'm the last writer in the world that does.

11:36.836 --> 11:37.817
Pen and ink.

11:37.837 --> 11:38.758
Yeah, pen and ink.

11:41.421 --> 11:43.023
Nobody else, I bet you don't.

11:43.043 --> 11:43.703
Is that a pencil?

11:43.824 --> 11:44.064
Pen.

11:45.245 --> 11:46.026
That's a pen.

11:46.046 --> 11:47.667
I know, but I mean, you don't use a pencil.

11:47.728 --> 11:53.413
A lot of writers who write with longhand, like Norman Mailer likes the number two pencil, for example.

11:53.433 --> 11:57.538
Yeah, but then I'm sure he rushes through his computer, too.

11:57.558 --> 11:57.998
But I don't.

11:58.096 --> 12:14.663
And as a matter of fact, there's something to be said for writing in pen and ink, because I have sold all the manuscripts of Texas Humanities, and I would imagine— We've been there, actually.

12:15.244 --> 12:18.889
I wrote about the HRC in a book that I wrote a couple of years ago.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.133
Yeah, what did you say to write about them?

12:21.282 --> 12:36.320
I wrote a book about bibliomania over 25 centuries, and of course this was one of the great cases of institutional, a very productive bibliomania, where they have assertively gone out and acquired wonderful archives such as yours.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.925
Well, they've acquired all these humanities, but actually they're not taught at Texas, are they?

12:41.105 --> 12:43.167
They're not taught at all, but it's a research.

12:43.208 --> 12:50.496
No, but Texas doesn't have a department of the humanities, actually, in the university.

12:51.218 --> 12:51.839
It did.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.782
They had a liberal arts college.

12:54.802 --> 12:56.705
I thought they got rid of the liberal arts.

12:56.745 --> 12:59.669
Well, they absorbed it into a... Call it what you will.

12:59.729 --> 13:00.610
Call it what you will.

13:01.511 --> 13:03.734
But that's not for undergraduate use anyway.

13:03.774 --> 13:09.661
It's to attract scholars like Michael Holroyd, for instance, who comes and researches a Shaw biographies there.

13:11.103 --> 13:16.610
That was really intended to attract the international scholar and not to support the curriculum.

13:16.630 --> 13:20.955
So I think it's irrelevant whether or not they teach these subjects there.

13:21.290 --> 13:24.495
It's a very, very interesting place.

13:24.555 --> 13:25.917
No, it's a moralist place.

13:25.937 --> 13:26.758
I've been there, actually.

13:26.778 --> 13:29.362
But they don't teach medicine, do they?

13:29.382 --> 13:31.005
You have to go to Charleston for that.

13:31.906 --> 13:34.750
Not Charleston, but maybe Houston, I think.

13:34.830 --> 13:35.491
Houston, perhaps.

13:35.652 --> 13:38.316
Anyway, where you wrote the book.

13:38.336 --> 13:40.138
But anyway, they're very kind.

13:40.158 --> 13:40.779
They have fun.

13:41.841 --> 13:50.554
And they do, I think, there's a shortage in the world.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.192
Well, it is interesting.

13:52.212 --> 13:54.695
Have you ever tried—I notice you have a typewriter over here.

13:55.115 --> 13:55.856
What's the process?

13:55.876 --> 13:58.859
Do you go from pen and ink to the typewriter?

13:58.879 --> 14:02.623
Oh, no, that's just the typing, you know, pieces of reviews and things.

14:02.643 --> 14:06.007
When I've written it or I get somebody to type it out.

14:06.027 --> 14:13.034
But, um, so, I mean, next door, my daughter's got all kinds of apparatus, but I've got them.

14:13.495 --> 14:14.736
Have you ever tried a computer?

14:16.505 --> 14:25.376
Yes, I've tried a word processor, but it doesn't correct in the way I want it to correct.

14:25.496 --> 14:32.604
I feel I wasn't designed for a word processor, really.

14:32.624 --> 14:43.197
I read also that you find writing to be an exceedingly arduous exercise, and you can quote it as saying you like having written, not so much the process of writing.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.959
Yes, surely all writers feel that.

14:45.631 --> 14:46.292
Perhaps they don't.

14:46.312 --> 14:54.921
But, you know, if anything happens that you can, anything to disturb you, you can make an exclusion of the telephone rings.

14:54.941 --> 14:56.083
It's such a relief, you know.

14:56.143 --> 15:00.167
You can give it up for a bit and go and watch Doctor.

15:00.628 --> 15:03.851
That's lovely.

15:04.372 --> 15:06.294
No, I find it a very painful process.

15:07.576 --> 15:14.203
The arts figure in your novels, in various degrees, poets,

15:14.639 --> 15:17.663
drama students, young drama students.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.568
There is a continuing interest in artistic expression in your work.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.674
Is that by design, or is that just more or less what emerges from it?

15:26.775 --> 15:30.560
Well, I suppose it certainly is what I'm interested in.

15:30.580 --> 15:36.508
The drama students were really only stage children, which isn't quite as grand as that I did teach there.

15:36.929 --> 15:37.309
I taught it.

15:37.329 --> 15:39.472
So you're saying everything's from her life, isn't it?

15:39.552 --> 15:40.533
That was, certainly.

15:41.094 --> 15:43.177
And that is a school for young drama students?

15:43.257 --> 15:44.038
Is that...

15:44.322 --> 15:45.644
But they aren't drama students.

15:45.664 --> 16:04.833
They were, they were, well, they did get parts, but they had the, always the knowledge that in a few years they probably wouldn't get in because very, very few child actors go on to be actors in their career now.

16:05.254 --> 16:06.195
There's certainly great ones.

16:06.344 --> 16:07.525
Sherry Temple didn't.

16:08.546 --> 16:09.147
She failed.

16:09.267 --> 16:11.629
Well, she does all sorts of things.

16:11.710 --> 16:13.431
I mean, I think she's a senator, isn't she?

16:13.451 --> 16:15.594
But she isn't an actress anymore.

16:15.614 --> 16:16.615
I mean, it doesn't change.

16:16.955 --> 16:17.476
Very rarely.

16:17.536 --> 16:20.799
Mickey Rooney seems to be the only one to have passed from a child start.

16:20.819 --> 16:21.960
Oh, yes, Mickey Rooney.

16:22.060 --> 16:22.921
I remember, yes.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.463
But it's very rare.

16:25.063 --> 16:26.745
And they had child parts.

16:26.825 --> 16:32.431
I mean, they'd come on as mice, you know, in the nutcracker suite.

16:32.832 --> 16:35.254
But as soon as they got past a certain start,

16:35.605 --> 16:54.771
It's quite a comment, don't you think, in the state of publishing today, where you are acknowledged to be one of the great—I don't mean to embarrass you—but acknowledged to be one of the great living novelists in the English language.

16:55.411 --> 16:57.034
Oh, I don't know about that.

16:57.194 --> 17:04.043
Well, I know the critics, Michael Derter and Richard Eater and all these wonderful people who have written these marvelous things about you.

17:04.647 --> 17:08.110
And yet, in the United States, they publish your books in paperback.

17:09.712 --> 17:14.356
Is that a comment, do you think, on the state of literary fiction today?

17:16.138 --> 17:20.102
I don't know what it is at all in America.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.204
I mean, here books have got expensive.

17:23.044 --> 17:30.912
And I think the trouble is, I mean, normally speaking, most people anyway, they buy a book, they expect to read it once.

17:32.213 --> 17:34.215
I mean, the novel, sorry.

17:34.550 --> 17:40.880
Other kinds of books might be books of reference, but normally you probably expect to read once and not again.

17:40.940 --> 17:45.167
You don't want to spend nearly 20 pounds on that.

17:45.187 --> 17:51.496
And so the paperback markets are very vital.

17:51.537 --> 17:56.424
I don't know about America, but do people buy hardbacks?

17:56.444 --> 18:01.452
For serious fiction, it's problematic, isn't it?

18:01.550 --> 18:07.859
It was an interesting strategy that they pursued here, and they do have now four of your books out in paper.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.561
They're quite nice, I have to say.

18:10.202 --> 18:12.025
Yeah, they are nice, yes.

18:12.866 --> 18:16.331
I mean, I don't know.

18:16.351 --> 18:23.581
I haven't been to America for years, but when I did Moscow, I found that the hardbacks were bought out at quite a high price.

18:23.601 --> 18:27.186
But that very same day, you could get them reduced to about half.

18:27.655 --> 18:29.617
This was in New York.

18:29.938 --> 18:30.899
It's still that way.

18:31.039 --> 18:34.243
You can buy books over the Internet now at 30 percent discount.

18:34.263 --> 18:34.923
Yes.

18:34.943 --> 18:37.807
So the prices aren't—well, you can't say.

18:37.827 --> 18:40.290
They're not real, are they?

18:42.192 --> 18:47.879
Well, I guess what I'm driving at is do you have any anxiety about the future of a literary novel?

18:52.924 --> 18:56.869
Well, anxiety about the future of everything is a matter of fact.

18:56.984 --> 19:06.917
But I mean, but anyway, certainly reading and books as a means of communicating.

19:06.977 --> 19:19.374
Because I think children, for instance, who should, I mean, they used to be the great readers, but no, they aren't really, are they?

19:19.394 --> 19:22.198
Because after all, they can watch it all.

19:24.406 --> 19:26.528
We're meeting later today with Robert Tuber.

19:26.548 --> 19:27.649
Do you know Robert Tuber?

19:27.849 --> 19:28.590
I don't know.

19:28.610 --> 19:50.312
He's an American writer in his 60s, and he is now pioneering this use of what they call interactive fiction, where you write a piece of work on a computer, and you invite the participation of the reader, of course because it's not a linear text anymore, it's what they call hypertext.

19:50.849 --> 19:56.118
And so therefore the writer is not in control of the story, which really sounds kind of scary when you think about it.

19:56.599 --> 19:57.680
I think that's a bad idea.

19:57.700 --> 20:04.732
I think the readers ought to keep their place.

20:06.715 --> 20:08.959
I really don't know.

20:14.558 --> 20:20.484
I mean, the media do present an enormous problem, don't you?

20:21.104 --> 20:24.747
It changes the whole dynamic of the creative process.

20:25.148 --> 20:25.748
It does, yeah.

20:26.769 --> 20:28.611
Do you have a sense of your fictional world?

20:30.473 --> 20:33.295
Do all of your books form a corpus in your view?

20:33.315 --> 20:41.443
Because they are drawn so clearly from your own personal experience, speaking particularly of the novels, do you think

20:41.845 --> 20:45.289
that they can be seen as part of one larger work?

20:48.513 --> 20:49.834
Well, no, I don't really.

20:49.854 --> 20:50.575
You know?

20:50.595 --> 20:51.596
Interesting.

20:52.538 --> 20:57.263
I mean, the last one I wrote, as a matter of fact, was about late 18th century Germany.

20:57.283 --> 21:00.507
It wasn't my own experience at all, you know.

21:02.009 --> 21:04.612
But you also have a Russian novel, as a matter of fact.

21:04.632 --> 21:05.052
Yes, yeah.

21:05.072 --> 21:08.376
And you have an Italian novel.

21:10.128 --> 21:15.736
So you have wandered a field in a number of interesting ways.

21:18.019 --> 21:30.137
Yeah, but it is a great temptation, I think, for a novice to go to a country or to a pastime when there were much more strict rules of behavior and procedure.

21:30.878 --> 21:38.228
And when there was a great danger, particularly for women, of breaking these rules, and it took great courage to do that.

21:38.613 --> 21:41.617
That's not the case at the moment, aren't you?

21:43.119 --> 21:49.268
But it makes the structure of the book much easier if there are things you can't do.

21:51.511 --> 21:59.322
I'm just going to read to you a quotation from the Sunday New York Times review of the book that's up for a National Book Critics' Circle Award, the Bufau.

22:00.404 --> 22:06.392
Quite astonishing book, a masterpiece, a great triumph, nothing short of dazzling.

22:06.878 --> 22:09.141
one of the great novels about a writer.

22:12.765 --> 22:20.854
So tell me a little bit about how you found this romantic poet in his early stages, and what about his life's suggestive novel?

22:20.874 --> 22:25.239
Well, it's actually not a... It is about the early stages of his life, not the time when he got... Exactly.

22:25.319 --> 22:26.861
...well-known, although... Right.

22:26.881 --> 22:28.803
...put Manny into 29, I think.

22:28.843 --> 22:31.246
But that started from the flower.

22:31.987 --> 22:36.312
It's a... No, wait a moment, that's a lotus.

22:36.663 --> 22:39.868
But there's a certain blue poppy.

22:42.091 --> 22:48.000
Well, that's one that has been sold in the street, actually, for a hospital, you know.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.124
But anyway, I've acquired these various blue flowers.

22:51.184 --> 22:57.213
But this blue poppy comes from the, well, it's on the borders of India and Tibet.

22:58.535 --> 23:01.620
And people do grow it over here.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.244
It never looks quite right, but it is the most beautiful plant.

23:04.264 --> 23:05.826
And I always wonder,

23:06.498 --> 23:09.041
I was kind of thought about it.

23:09.562 --> 23:17.793
This is actually very dull, but I can't... Anyway, I was... I'm very devoted to Lawrence, to D.H.

23:17.833 --> 23:20.036
Lawrence.

23:20.056 --> 23:27.967
And I was reading... It's really a short story.

23:27.987 --> 23:28.868
It's called The Fox.

23:28.888 --> 23:31.051
It's not quite that he wrote.

23:31.111 --> 23:33.214
And at the end he...

23:36.113 --> 23:43.581
He talks about the beautiful blue flower that's always beyond our grasp, and yet we can't have reaching out for it.

23:44.101 --> 23:46.044
And I thought, well, how does Lawrence know it's blue?

23:46.124 --> 23:48.927
I mean, I understand the image of it.

23:48.947 --> 23:54.132
And I realized he was talking about this blue flower, this blue poppy.

23:54.152 --> 24:03.522
And that led me on to the blue flower by this, well, we call him Novalis over here, but apparently it should be novelist.

24:04.244 --> 24:06.527
So there's a difficulty about pronouncing him.

24:07.048 --> 24:08.690
And I'd never read it before, actually.

24:08.711 --> 24:12.656
So I knew it was a book that wasn't finished.

24:12.676 --> 24:14.038
And then I got interested in him.

24:14.539 --> 24:17.023
So Lawrence led you to this.

24:17.043 --> 24:18.004
That's very interesting.

24:18.986 --> 24:19.286
Yes.

24:20.067 --> 24:26.877
Lawrence is very interested in plants and flowers, of course.

24:30.367 --> 24:41.938
It was actually discovered by the inevitable English officer, you know, adventuring through those parts.

24:42.839 --> 24:59.395
But anyway, I just, in his book, in his book, The Blue Fly, it's the untainable thing, you know, things everyone wants to grasp.

25:00.725 --> 25:06.050
I thought I'd like to find out about him, but it was quite a business, actually, because our German is not very good.

25:07.111 --> 25:08.933
And it took me a long time.

25:08.953 --> 25:11.696
It's not translated, you know.

25:11.976 --> 25:13.117
His letters certainly aren't.

25:13.558 --> 25:14.919
You've got to read them in German.

25:17.141 --> 25:24.628
So you read the works in the original German, and I understand you got these books at the London Library, is that right?

25:24.648 --> 25:25.769
The London Library, yes.

25:25.790 --> 25:26.931
Which we're going to tomorrow morning.

25:27.091 --> 25:28.352
I got it out for...

25:29.311 --> 25:30.032
Two years.

25:30.132 --> 25:31.814
And they never asked.

25:31.834 --> 25:32.575
They never sent her.

25:33.316 --> 25:35.499
That's the London Library for you, you know.

25:37.042 --> 25:38.604
I mean, I presume nobody was asking.

25:38.744 --> 25:42.249
They would have written, but anyway.

25:42.289 --> 25:44.452
We're going there tomorrow morning to see Alan Bell.

25:44.992 --> 25:50.780
I'm writing a new book about book places and book people, and this is one of the great, great libraries, apparently.

25:50.820 --> 25:53.564
Well, it is, but it was started by Carlisle.

25:53.724 --> 25:56.348
But the rumor is that they're going to want to move.

25:56.648 --> 25:57.389
I hope they don't.

25:57.409 --> 25:58.130
That'll be terrible.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.492
Well, I'll ask them tomorrow morning.

26:00.512 --> 26:06.799
Well, I don't know what he'll say, but I suppose it has financial problems like everything else on Earth.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.442
But just think of the movie and all those books.

26:09.502 --> 26:10.623
It would be dreadful.

26:10.643 --> 26:16.089
I think what I read is that they're looking to expand their space, not necessarily move.

26:16.889 --> 26:17.270
I read that.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.152
Well, I'm sure that's right.

26:19.672 --> 26:22.415
I only had a rumor that they were going to move.

26:22.776 --> 26:25.018
I don't think they could expand where they are.

26:25.437 --> 26:36.427
But that's a wonderful kind of an institution where you can take out books and keep them indefinitely until somebody asks to see them.

26:36.688 --> 26:40.011
Yes, I think they're having to tighten up their rules a bit.

26:40.031 --> 26:44.455
And of course, they've had their computerizing their catalog.

26:44.475 --> 26:47.017
But still, otherwise, it's the same in a London library.

26:48.219 --> 26:52.963
So as you worked your way through translating these poems,

26:53.635 --> 26:59.942
The poems are translated, but it's letters, yeah.

27:01.544 --> 27:06.249
Did the elements of a novel start to suggest itself as you were doing?

27:06.269 --> 27:14.097
Well, I couldn't really depart from the story of his family, and that's all in his letters, really.

27:14.117 --> 27:19.643
So it's almost a kind of fictional biography in a way, isn't it?

27:20.939 --> 27:25.844
Yes, I don't really know whether there ought to be such things, but yes, it is.

27:25.864 --> 27:27.725
You've done different kinds of novels.

27:29.387 --> 27:30.848
You've called them period pieces.

27:32.390 --> 27:34.632
Do you try to do something different with each novel?

27:35.052 --> 27:44.421
Is each novel a challenge in terms of form for you?

27:44.441 --> 27:47.224
Well, I certainly feel differently about them, yes.

27:47.244 --> 27:48.465
I feel I've got to have my

27:48.918 --> 27:52.542
Title, first paragraph, and last paragraph before I start.

27:52.783 --> 27:55.946
But it's apart from that.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.249
So you have to know how it ends, then.

27:58.509 --> 27:59.791
Yeah.

27:59.811 --> 28:04.216
So it's not serendipity for you, so to speak, then, is it?

28:04.236 --> 28:05.658
No, I can't use the ending.

28:05.678 --> 28:07.480
I've got to have that first.

28:07.500 --> 28:13.727
And that is interesting, because it's been said that I think you've only written one book with a happy ending.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.593
Yes, I did make an effort about that.

28:16.734 --> 28:20.239
I thought I must have had the ending, but I decided on that first.

28:22.924 --> 28:27.571
Why do you suppose that is, then, if you know in advance the ending, that most of your work turns out?

28:28.933 --> 28:31.077
Well, I mostly know it's going to have an unhappy ending.

28:31.618 --> 28:32.419
I wonder why that is.

28:34.282 --> 28:36.886
Well, all the whole thing's due, don't they?

28:36.906 --> 28:39.951
I mean, it's something that doesn't.

28:44.757 --> 28:55.098
But I think endings have been very much influenced by TV.

29:00.248 --> 29:06.040
I mean, the TV, whether it's a bit of a serial, whether it's a complete play,

29:06.458 --> 29:12.163
You notice that you're often really getting interested towards the end, and then the credits have to start rolling up.

29:12.203 --> 29:13.464
You know, it's left, really.

29:14.565 --> 29:15.747
It's neither one way or other.

29:16.507 --> 29:22.413
And I think you can see the influence of that in the novel.

29:25.876 --> 29:33.563
You were quoted once as saying that, I think one of your relatives said that you write a biography about someone that you love,

29:34.167 --> 29:36.590
And you write a novel about someone you dislike.

29:36.790 --> 29:38.111
Is that a fair assessment?

29:38.191 --> 29:39.333
Is that what you were advised?

29:39.373 --> 29:41.375
And have you followed that in your work?

29:41.995 --> 29:47.401
Well, I certainly think it's a mistake to write a biography about somebody you hate.

29:47.421 --> 29:50.865
I mean, people have attempted it, but I think it's wrong, you know.

29:52.426 --> 29:56.030
I don't think you really hate all the people in the novel now.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.613
I shouldn't have said that.

29:58.633 --> 29:59.814
I don't think you said hate either.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.356
I think you said dislike.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.765
There's a degree.

30:04.266 --> 30:10.155
Do you feel more comfortable with female, creating female characters, or your male characters?

30:10.175 --> 30:17.146
Because they do seem different, other than the gender, of course, but they seem different.

30:17.166 --> 30:27.883
Well, there's a certain sort of man I do like, you know, who's sort of what we used to call a decent man, you know, kind of quiet and he doesn't want to be worried too much, you know.

30:28.943 --> 30:33.288
If you ask about what he thinks about somebody, he says, oh, he's all right, you know.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.731
To be all right is quite sufficient.

30:36.751 --> 30:47.583
And I think these people who tend to get the heavy end in life, you know, they're often not very successful, not very fortunate.

30:48.504 --> 30:50.947
And they're life's losers, really.

30:51.447 --> 30:58.495
I'm attracted to them.

31:00.652 --> 31:14.508
I'm just going to briefly look at my notes here.

31:17.952 --> 31:23.839
Does the critical response that you've used, has that been a surprise, a pleasant surprise to you?

31:23.859 --> 31:27.503
When you started writing, I think you said it was because

31:28.478 --> 31:30.501
had to do something to earn an income.

31:31.622 --> 31:42.316
Did you anticipate that you would be shortlisted for the Booker, I think, three times winner, now shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award in the States?

31:43.117 --> 31:45.460
The critical approbation has been quite remarkable.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.083
Is this something that you at all anticipated?

31:48.103 --> 31:48.904
No, not at all.

31:48.944 --> 31:56.494
And I was told, you know, I just don't know.

31:57.622 --> 32:03.888
Perhaps that wasn't fair with you, but you start really from nothing, don't you?

32:03.908 --> 32:11.736
All artists do, and at first you don't sell much, and then, I don't know, you're lucky that the game's ground.

32:12.477 --> 32:23.308
I think the hard thing is the critics on the old, you know, those that...

32:25.246 --> 32:31.395
It's a very curious thing that you pay more attention to those who dislike the books than those that like them.

32:31.496 --> 32:35.101
I don't know why it is.

32:35.121 --> 32:50.865
Do you agree with, when we look at the careers of writers, and especially when it covers most of their adult lives, you can almost see works that emerge that are just right for that point in their development.

32:51.250 --> 32:55.875
And that book could not have been written at any other time, let's say, except when the writer was 40 or 35.

32:56.175 --> 33:02.121
Does your work reflect where you were at this point in your life?

33:02.181 --> 33:15.655
Had you started writing fiction in your 30s or your 40s, would it be an entirely different, do you think, body of work in terms of your outlook and your input and your perceptions?

33:17.305 --> 33:17.906
No, really.

33:17.966 --> 33:21.190
I had an aunt who wrote all her life for most novels.

33:21.851 --> 33:28.320
And she finally had a really, well, a sort of nervous breakdown.

33:28.661 --> 33:30.083
Anyway, she went to a nursing home.

33:30.423 --> 33:36.732
But what she did is she turned on the lights after the nurses had gone and wrote a novel about the nursing home.

33:37.192 --> 33:39.656
I mean, you know, she couldn't be stopped.

33:40.277 --> 33:42.840
And she wrote the whole of her life.

33:46.533 --> 33:48.155
I'd rather like to have done that.

33:49.658 --> 33:56.748
I can't really answer that.

33:56.848 --> 33:58.010
You had to answer.

33:58.310 --> 33:59.873
I can't really answer your question.

34:00.173 --> 34:01.395
When did you start writing?

34:02.897 --> 34:04.720
Books in my forties.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.103
Not right from when you were very young.

34:07.143 --> 34:08.806
I've been a journalist all my life.

34:08.826 --> 34:13.873
I've written for publication, but my first book was just published in 1995.

34:14.917 --> 34:17.660
50, I guess, when that book came out, 51.

34:18.982 --> 34:22.867
I really think you can start at any age.

34:22.887 --> 34:24.889
But there is wisdom with years, I think.

34:25.210 --> 34:26.111
Well, there should be.

34:26.211 --> 34:27.913
I'm not sure that it is.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.154
I've had my grandchildren.

34:29.174 --> 34:31.757
Don't think so.

34:31.778 --> 34:32.839
That's wonderful.

34:32.919 --> 34:36.563
I love that.

34:36.623 --> 34:39.106
So are you working on another novel now?

34:39.287 --> 34:40.248
Well, I want to be.

34:40.288 --> 34:43.692
That sort of question, I mean, I am...

34:44.077 --> 34:48.443
I'm under contract for another one, but I can't say I've done it.

34:50.686 --> 34:51.307
That's bad.

34:53.670 --> 34:58.637
But, um... I don't feel hopeless.

34:58.657 --> 35:00.219
I mean, I feel I'll write another one.

35:01.240 --> 35:07.148
Do you feel... I don't even know if this will have anything to do with this piece, but it's a question I'm interested in.

35:07.389 --> 35:09.992
Do you feel that completed work is completed work?

35:10.012 --> 35:11.434
When Henry James, for instance,

35:11.903 --> 35:14.506
went in to write the prefaces to the New York edition.

35:14.826 --> 35:15.427
Yeah.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.810
He found himself tinkering with novels that he'd written.

35:17.890 --> 35:18.931
Yeah, he did tinkering, didn't he?

35:18.951 --> 35:20.593
The words were at the same thing with his poetry.

35:21.374 --> 35:24.557
Yes, I feel it's a pity that he altered the thing so much.

35:28.582 --> 35:32.647
But we can't hope to be like Henry James, really and truly he is one of, wasn't he?

35:32.767 --> 35:35.650
He's quite an extraordinary person.

35:41.198 --> 35:46.284
There just isn't the scope now to be a Henry James.

35:46.804 --> 35:54.172
Of course, people don't write these prefaces anymore, do they?

35:54.212 --> 35:55.814
The prefaces are wonderful.

35:56.895 --> 35:57.656
That's interesting.

35:57.676 --> 35:58.117
They don't.

35:59.278 --> 36:04.504
And yet he wasn't enormously successful financially in his lifetime, was he?

36:04.524 --> 36:05.124
I don't believe so.

36:05.144 --> 36:09.349
He needed family help, I believe.

36:10.915 --> 36:15.100
And Wordsworth, of course, changed much for the worse.

36:15.281 --> 36:16.803
I can't.

36:16.903 --> 36:18.825
Yes, I'm afraid it was for the worse, yes.

36:19.386 --> 36:25.314
Perhaps it's never a good idea to change, to sit with your own kind of changes.

36:25.334 --> 36:26.014
Especially fiction.

36:26.095 --> 36:33.604
I guess what I'm suggesting is that it does speak for a time in your development, in your artistic development.

36:33.624 --> 36:38.070
For better or for worse, that's an expression of who you were at that point in your life.

36:39.569 --> 36:59.645
I think that is true, but I mean, they're sort of great masters of the novel, I mean, Balzac, Dickens, they're writing a tremendous pitch right there, and they usually, in fact, probably as a serial, and then they've got to rush on to the next one, and then they die with one half finished, you know, I don't, I mean, novel writing is a strange business.

37:00.887 --> 37:02.370
Now, you mentioned that you have

37:02.958 --> 37:05.341
books all up to the spirit?

37:05.361 --> 37:05.942
Yes, there are.

37:05.962 --> 37:06.984
The ceiling is to give away.

37:07.024 --> 37:10.449
There's a terrible char of that.

37:11.150 --> 37:13.513
Can you tell us what you enjoy reading the most?

37:13.533 --> 37:16.818
Do you read any contemporary novelists?

37:16.838 --> 37:20.824
Well, I'm certainly going to when I start on the book, I'm just preparing to.

37:21.465 --> 37:27.914
But for pleasure, I guess, I'm asking.

37:27.934 --> 37:32.661
Well, I find it hard not to go back to the dear old favorites.

37:33.029 --> 37:35.113
I think perhaps that's a sign of a second child.

37:35.634 --> 37:36.155
No, it isn't.

37:36.215 --> 37:37.477
I've always done that.

37:37.497 --> 37:41.324
And they rest you like nothing else can.

37:41.344 --> 37:43.609
The fact that you've read them dozens of times already.

37:44.170 --> 37:54.008
In fact, sometimes I don't read the whole of them, but just scenes that I particularly like, you know.

37:56.418 --> 37:58.661
Who in particular do you go to for pleasure?

37:58.681 --> 38:00.122
You mean present-day writers?

38:00.322 --> 38:06.229
No, I mean in the classics, who in particular do you find special pleasure?

38:08.552 --> 38:12.036
You mentioned Dickens and Balzac again.

38:12.056 --> 38:20.646
People don't read Dickens now, so perhaps they don't need to because he's forever on the TV, isn't he?

38:22.308 --> 38:25.952
I'm very fond of Lawrence.

38:26.202 --> 38:28.986
I think he's rather out of fashion, I don't know, I think so.

38:29.126 --> 38:32.712
But when I taught, I used to teach Lawrence's novels.

38:34.715 --> 38:41.826
You know, it was wonderful to see how these people, they're about 15 at the end, they really, really young him.

38:43.989 --> 38:52.041
So particularly engaging with his writing, how the young readers... Yes, and I used to love teaching...

38:52.392 --> 38:55.956
James Joyce's, not Ulysses, but The Portrait of the Artist.

38:56.036 --> 39:14.117
And it's quite difficult, well, it gets difficult as it goes on, but they were prepared to undertake any difficulties, you know, because they felt it was true to growing up, the feeling of growing up.

39:14.357 --> 39:17.100
I'm sorry, did you say when you start you have the first

39:18.363 --> 39:21.428
the first sentence, the first paragraph, the last paragraph.

39:21.448 --> 39:22.569
Do you have your title as well?

39:22.970 --> 39:32.585
Yes, but the title depends on the publisher, and the publisher there depends very much on the sales force or whatever you... The marketing department.

39:32.605 --> 39:33.747
The marketing department.

39:33.787 --> 39:40.597
They know, they know exactly what novel title is going to, you know, appeal to the public.

39:40.617 --> 39:45.204
So I've had them altered, you know, rather.

39:45.224 --> 39:47.087
Could you give us a few examples of how

39:47.523 --> 39:51.168
of titles that you have had that have been changed by publishers?

39:52.149 --> 40:01.961
Well, there was one called The Gate of Angels, and it was about Cambridge in, you know, at the end of the, well, the beginning of the 20th century, really.

40:02.542 --> 40:14.897
And I can't remember now what I did, I don't want to call it, but certainly all my titles were rejected, and The Gate of Angels was considered more attractive.

40:18.505 --> 40:21.249
I think that's terrible that they change your titles.

40:21.269 --> 40:22.371
They shouldn't change your titles.

40:25.515 --> 40:33.467
Well, on the other hand, the sales force, the marketing departments are really the heroes of the whole book business, aren't they?

40:33.487 --> 40:43.061
They're going on down to very obscure places, and they somehow make the shops accept, you know.

40:43.241 --> 40:47.668
That's ten, and I suppose you have to take

40:47.969 --> 40:49.291
take their word for it, really.

40:49.871 --> 40:55.158
Well, they might have changed the title of Lomita, which you discuss in the book shot.

40:55.539 --> 40:57.662
And I'm wondering, did that incident actually happen?

40:57.682 --> 41:04.490
Yes, that did, yes, that it did, yes.

41:04.510 --> 41:12.881
It's impossible to imagine now what a scandal that book calls, because it wouldn't, it's not, it doesn't seem scandalous now.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.765
Well, they had a film that they were having trouble

41:16.319 --> 41:21.746
distributing, however, based on Lolita, which I guess recently they haven't... I didn't know.

41:21.766 --> 41:23.509
I didn't know there was a film in Lolita.

41:23.529 --> 41:26.092
I thought there was a new version or something.

41:26.112 --> 41:30.318
I read something that they're having problems with... Well, I suppose they might.

41:30.738 --> 41:39.230
And yet you see that you can't really film Lolita, because you can't give the Atrobus who tells the story.

41:39.290 --> 41:43.896
I mean, to understand them, you can't really do that with a film, can you?

41:45.260 --> 42:05.183
But it really was a difficult title to... I wanted to call it something of unobservables, the importance of unobservables or something like that.

42:07.846 --> 42:09.147
But they didn't like that at all.

42:09.167 --> 42:10.529
They said it wouldn't go into the cover.

42:10.549 --> 42:12.651
Of course it wouldn't.

42:13.458 --> 42:18.847
So I was following something there where you start with the first paragraph and you know the final paragraph.

42:19.028 --> 42:20.270
Do you also know the characters?

42:21.291 --> 42:22.513
No, not really, no.

42:22.714 --> 42:25.579
So they more or less have room to develop in the writing?

42:26.821 --> 42:35.095
Yes, they do, but of course I do write rather short books, which is... You do, and I wonder if you could discuss that, actually.

42:36.222 --> 42:39.026
Although the critics say they're just about the right length.

42:39.086 --> 42:45.775
Well, perhaps they are of your critics, because they're about to get through in the week, but I'm just thinking of the Don Delino book, you know.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.437
Oh, yeah, yes, yeah.

42:47.457 --> 42:50.521
Oh, yeah, I mean, I can't remember what the length is, but it's... It's enormous.

42:50.761 --> 42:52.043
Oh, the pinch-on is enormous.

42:52.123 --> 42:53.965
The new pinch-on is enormous as well.

42:54.846 --> 43:01.295
Yes, so that's the other extreme, and I think the American novel on the whole has been enormous.

43:01.315 --> 43:05.200
I mean, the wolf there was enormous, and maybe Dickies is enormous.

43:07.694 --> 43:14.862
Well, perhaps if you live in an enormous country, you do quite enormous novels.

43:14.882 --> 43:18.446
Did you have anything that you asked us to find?

43:18.466 --> 43:20.028
I mean, the troops had a blue poppy.

43:20.048 --> 43:21.089
I've never seen it.

43:21.109 --> 43:22.691
Have you seen a blue poppy?

43:22.751 --> 43:24.573
Were you inspired to go find one?

43:24.813 --> 43:25.574
A blue poppy?

43:25.634 --> 43:25.975
The blue poppy.

43:25.995 --> 43:32.122
Well, you see, they were brought over here by this, I can't remember what date.

43:32.142 --> 43:36.807
It was just before the First World War, this, you know, English officer.

43:36.888 --> 43:42.815
And they grow, a lot of people do grow them, so I've often seen them growing over here, but they don't look right.

43:42.856 --> 43:50.765
I was trying to imagine what it would look like because they have such beautiful, the orange, the red poppies, whatever.

43:50.786 --> 43:55.311
Well, I can't tell you that they, they've got them in a queue.

43:55.912 --> 44:03.081
Somebody told me that you should see them from below because they grow on the foothills, you know.

44:03.567 --> 44:04.828
They don't really take here.

44:04.908 --> 44:08.832
After a year or two, they die whilst they transmute in some way, you know.

44:08.852 --> 44:11.014
Well, they do change.

44:11.034 --> 44:11.395
They change a bit.

44:11.415 --> 44:18.322
Yeah, and it's so that in a way they've succeeded.

44:18.342 --> 44:21.045
You know, they're trying to get started, but they don't.

44:23.347 --> 44:24.648
But I've never been to this.

44:26.050 --> 44:29.233
I've never been to this foothills, you know, of Tibet.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.954
I've never seen them go.

44:30.974 --> 44:31.515
I should do.

44:33.773 --> 44:39.982
Any other foreign countries that you're interested in writing about now?

44:45.390 --> 44:46.532
Well, I don't know, really.

44:46.552 --> 44:50.337
I don't feel they're foreign when I'm writing about them.

44:51.018 --> 44:55.685
That's funny.

44:56.647 --> 44:59.070
I'm not able to answer hearty questions.

44:59.090 --> 45:00.372
I'm sorry.

45:01.195 --> 45:04.218
I'm certainly interested in your experience with the BBC as well.

45:04.238 --> 45:07.461
What did you do with the BBC?

45:07.701 --> 45:09.262
Well, I was very, very junior.

45:11.464 --> 45:15.588
Really, we had then these discs, they were called records.

45:15.608 --> 45:16.189
They were 75.

45:17.430 --> 45:19.211
We didn't use many tapes in the war.

45:19.351 --> 45:20.673
They were like this.

45:20.693 --> 45:21.533
They were very heavy.

45:22.034 --> 45:28.840
They were cut with wax, and you could scrape the wax off and re-wax them and use them again.

45:29.562 --> 45:34.589
They would have things like churches, speeches or something on that needed various programs.

45:34.609 --> 45:40.278
And we really just toiled about the building bringing these records, often the wrong ones.

45:40.298 --> 45:44.604
You can imagine the difficulty for the programs.

45:44.624 --> 45:50.153
And there was a very strict unionization in the BBC then.

45:50.193 --> 45:55.020
I mean, we weren't allowed to touch any of the equipment unless you belonged to the electrician's union.

45:55.921 --> 45:57.223
I don't know whether they could take them off.

45:57.912 --> 45:58.693
I don't think so.

45:58.913 --> 45:59.454
I like that now.

45:59.474 --> 46:03.579
But anyway, so that's what we were.

46:03.619 --> 46:06.763
I think we were called Recorded Programme Assistants.

46:06.783 --> 46:09.506
Recorded Programme Assistants, RPH, that's right.

46:10.607 --> 46:13.331
But everything was on shift, you know, in the BBC.

46:13.351 --> 46:15.413
It had to be during the war.

46:15.533 --> 46:23.082
I was curious, I mean, it still looks much the same in Broadcasting House.

46:23.102 --> 46:26.907
I mean, the things were very good quality and all the lino and things, just the same.

46:27.207 --> 46:32.733
Well, the BBC has always been regarded as the best, and it still is.

46:34.335 --> 46:39.560
Well, yes, I think they're in trouble now, but everything is in trouble.

46:42.103 --> 46:45.386
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

46:51.313 --> 46:52.995
And you lived on a houseboat.

46:53.956 --> 46:54.396
Yes.

46:54.798 --> 46:56.781
Well, a houseboat isn't really what it was.

46:56.861 --> 46:58.543
It was a sailing barge.

46:58.904 --> 47:00.085
And that's to say it had been.

47:00.105 --> 47:01.267
It was about a hundred years old.

47:01.807 --> 47:02.709
And it had been.

47:03.330 --> 47:05.072
It had a very honorable career.

47:05.092 --> 47:07.295
It still had the mast, you know.

47:07.756 --> 47:10.359
They say you can run them with just a man and a boy.

47:10.399 --> 47:13.483
And they were coast-wise traffic.

47:13.503 --> 47:15.666
You know, they took things to and fro.

47:15.706 --> 47:17.689
An enormous hold.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.393
You ditch sheep or coal or anything.

47:21.594 --> 47:22.155
And...

47:23.890 --> 47:29.219
So that she wasn't a houseboat sounds rather frivolous, but she wasn't really a frivolous craft.

47:29.560 --> 47:32.585
The only trouble was that she did leak most terribly.

47:32.605 --> 47:34.589
I mean, she'd really come to the end of her life.

47:37.654 --> 47:45.729
But the title, it does become a question, does this houseboat become a metaphor for you?

47:45.749 --> 47:48.193
Do you think metaphorically in terms of these experiences?

47:48.376 --> 47:51.160
Well, I suppose it was a metaphor, but it did actually sink, you know.

47:51.200 --> 47:56.408
That's what's wonderful.

47:56.568 --> 48:00.394
We had to be taken off by the inner police.

48:02.297 --> 48:03.338
That's wonderful.

48:05.762 --> 48:18.180
I guess that's where we readers see the metaphoric influences, but you're recording it as you recall it, and that's the way it works into, and if it becomes a metaphoric

48:18.481 --> 48:22.306
Yes, I don't know which way around it is, but they were very cheap.

48:22.346 --> 48:23.308
They were a pound a week.

48:23.408 --> 48:25.390
You couldn't get much cheaper than that.

48:25.831 --> 48:31.959
And I think they're still there, but I think they've all been done over.

48:31.979 --> 48:33.982
You know, they're all more smartened up now.

48:34.984 --> 48:47.020
And you do come from a family of clergymen, I understand, and this experience, would you say that this experience does influence the body of your work?

48:47.219 --> 49:16.804
I think the fact that most of them did all this writing, you know, the idea of writing being a natural activity, rather like eating, that came from my family.

49:16.919 --> 49:21.944
And it sounds like you've had a totally fascinating family, though.

49:21.964 --> 49:28.411
And every one had something, elements that you've been... Well, yes, they're all dead now.

49:29.613 --> 49:31.395
Still, I shouldn't complain.

49:31.795 --> 49:32.456
Complain?

49:32.556 --> 49:34.037
I mean, I'm here with my grandchildren.

49:34.057 --> 49:35.439
And how many grandchildren do you have?

49:35.459 --> 49:36.240
Well, there's three in this house.

49:36.260 --> 49:37.401
I've got nine altogether.

49:37.441 --> 49:37.902
Really?

49:37.922 --> 49:39.503
But in this house, there's three.

49:41.085 --> 49:42.847
And you have three children, I understand.

49:43.287 --> 49:44.749
Yes, I've got three children, yes.

49:46.889 --> 49:48.412
That's the way it goes, you see.

49:48.432 --> 49:51.618
We have three children and nine grandchildren.

49:51.638 --> 49:56.427
I mean, no wonder the world is, I don't know.

49:56.547 --> 49:58.130
I think that we have a lot.

49:58.150 --> 50:00.234
Do you mind if I take a few photographs of you?

50:00.975 --> 50:02.097
No, shall I put the light on?

50:02.117 --> 50:03.760
It's going to be dark, isn't it?

50:03.880 --> 50:07.547
Okay, let me put a little bit of light in there.

50:15.593 --> 50:26.753
I'd love to get a picture made with the books.

50:26.773 --> 50:31.402
Where do you normally sit to do that?

50:31.422 --> 50:36.471
Well, most women don't really sit anywhere, and then sometimes at the copyrights are, you know.

50:37.058 --> 50:43.827
You have said, by the way, that's another thing, that it's a lot harder for women to write, isn't it, than... Well, I think they do it in a different way.

50:43.847 --> 50:48.252
I mean, they're all kitchen table writers, I think, you know, because there's something you always have to do.

50:48.272 --> 50:51.156
Maybe I can get a picture of it to my wife and Ms.

50:51.276 --> 50:51.736
Sterling together.

50:51.837 --> 50:52.898
All right, yes, certainly.

50:52.918 --> 50:54.660
I love the books.

50:56.182 --> 50:56.723
Do you like that?

50:57.163 --> 51:01.389
No, but I'm not sure what that is.

51:01.409 --> 51:03.491
I don't think you should be standing in the background.

51:03.511 --> 51:06.475
Thank you.

51:07.282 --> 51:11.367
Now I'm going to get a picture made with the books.

51:11.487 --> 51:14.250
You can just sit right there.

51:14.270 --> 51:14.891
It's almost how I'm tiny.

51:14.971 --> 51:15.892
Pictures are bummed with you.

51:15.912 --> 51:19.817
Why don't you come here?

51:19.837 --> 51:22.360
Maybe, could you perhaps sit in this chair right here?

51:23.461 --> 51:23.921
Oh, good, yeah.

51:24.402 --> 51:26.564
Thank you.

51:26.584 --> 51:32.151
And then I could get a picture with the books in the background, and I do love the books, and I could get the outside, too.

51:32.171 --> 51:32.812
Oh, that's nice.

51:33.132 --> 51:33.913
That's very nice.

51:38.399 --> 51:53.457
I'm going to come in just a little bit closer, if that's OK.

51:53.477 --> 51:55.160
I always blink when I have it.

51:55.180 --> 51:56.261
Other people don't seem to.

51:56.321 --> 51:58.023
I don't know how they manage to avoid it.

51:58.043 --> 52:01.688
Well, I'm going to try this one, which is, it'll flash twice.

52:01.928 --> 52:03.770
Oh, no.

52:03.790 --> 52:05.352
And that way, if you do blink, it'll

52:09.753 --> 52:11.895
That's supposed to take the red out of your eyes.

52:12.776 --> 52:14.818
Well, I have noticed the red, yes.

52:15.859 --> 52:18.042
They just had a very nice photo of you first.

52:18.062 --> 52:30.695
And we have some wonderful photographs that they have since, by the way, that really do.

52:30.715 --> 52:35.259
I'll be by, um, oh, yeah.

52:35.279 --> 52:35.459
Oh, yeah.

52:35.479 --> 52:35.820
Your own sweater.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.983
And I don't know if you had your arm, any final arm with it.

52:39.723 --> 52:43.206
The one that you took of you that we had?

52:43.726 --> 52:47.310
Oh, yes, sir.

52:47.390 --> 52:49.391
Do you remember who took that?

52:50.512 --> 52:52.174
I think there was a publicity photo.

52:52.894 --> 52:57.018
She's a well-known photographer, but I can't... My memory is fading me.

53:05.505 --> 53:08.548
Could you kindly look at Tina for anything?

53:14.232 --> 53:23.982
It's been very nice.

53:24.002 --> 53:28.367
What a wonderful feel, but we're still kind of in the midst of a winter.

53:28.387 --> 53:30.690
We were snowing when we left.

53:30.710 --> 53:31.611
Oh, was it?

53:31.631 --> 53:32.431
Terrible, yes.

53:32.451 --> 53:34.554
The damatils have just failed this year.

53:34.614 --> 53:43.243
Yeah, but I think it was too warm with the long voice.

53:45.535 --> 54:08.640
Near Worcester, the city of Worcester.

54:09.278 --> 54:12.521
It has been a very mild winter, too.

54:13.962 --> 54:18.626
I just want to get a long shot.

54:18.646 --> 54:24.972
We have about 22 newspapers that I'm writing this particular article for.

54:24.992 --> 54:25.993
Are you syndicated there?

54:26.013 --> 54:26.494
Yes.

54:26.514 --> 54:29.676
And you always are, are you?

54:29.917 --> 54:30.177
Yes.

54:30.477 --> 54:33.039
Basically, we work together and have syndicated.

54:33.059 --> 54:38.104
This is the boss of the operation.

54:39.130 --> 54:48.560
This is a nice picture.

54:50.302 --> 54:51.203
I like this a lot.

54:51.223 --> 55:01.574
We also do children's book reviews, and she does the children's book reviews.

55:01.614 --> 55:04.817
We do this out of conviction, because we do love

55:05.050 --> 55:30.265
What was that?

55:30.515 --> 55:46.110
I don't think they can really make that an income problem.

55:46.130 --> 55:46.191
No.

55:46.211 --> 55:49.494
It's fine if you can attack it and do other things.

55:49.514 --> 55:49.614
Yeah.

55:49.634 --> 55:53.318
But, um... ...syndicated, and I don't think you can get to the magazine syndicated unless you have a lot of experience.

55:53.398 --> 55:54.519
Yeah, no, I don't know when that's done.

55:54.539 --> 55:57.141
And people that are usually up there, when they reach back, it seems like they have all these good experiences.

55:57.161 --> 55:57.822
They don't want to do the truth.

55:58.645 --> 56:04.373
And so we do a major feature and a major author once a week.

56:04.393 --> 56:09.079
And we do the children's books once a month.

56:09.419 --> 56:16.168
And then I also write a column for a magazine once a month.

56:16.248 --> 56:20.474
It's a book magazine for bibliophiles.

56:22.657 --> 56:26.762
We couldn't leave here yesterday until I filed this 2,000-word story.

56:27.046 --> 56:31.853
And I finished it for 45 minutes before the bus came to pick us up.

56:33.195 --> 56:39.443
It's difficult, isn't it?

56:39.463 --> 56:42.588
It's very difficult.

56:44.330 --> 56:48.636
We have to walk down to a place called The Flask, which I think is down here.

56:48.837 --> 56:52.682
I passed it.

56:53.540 --> 57:01.210
I don't know if you go down into the flask.

57:01.330 --> 57:05.335
I mean, this way uphill is up to Hyggett Village.

57:05.516 --> 57:06.517
I see.

57:06.537 --> 57:08.680
If you turn... Go up this way.

57:08.700 --> 57:08.840
Yeah.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.302
Well, you can see it's going uphill.

57:10.702 --> 57:10.963
Okay.

57:11.483 --> 57:11.684
Down.

57:11.944 --> 57:13.546
Well, it goes down into London, really.

57:13.706 --> 57:15.489
That way it goes into London.

57:15.509 --> 57:16.129
Yes, it does.

57:16.550 --> 57:18.192
And this way we go to the flask.

57:19.193 --> 57:21.977
You notice that that's...

57:23.358 --> 57:27.323
This other gentleman lives in North London, too, so we're going to meet him over.

57:27.343 --> 57:28.685
But will the flask be open?

57:29.947 --> 57:31.168
Uh, he said it would.

57:31.188 --> 57:41.121
Well, he'll hear what he knows, you know, because they, um... He'll be there, I'm sure.

57:41.161 --> 57:42.163
I'm sure he must know.

57:42.223 --> 57:43.865
Obviously, he goes to flask frequently.

57:45.507 --> 57:47.690
There'd better be a good place to talk.

57:47.710 --> 57:49.973
There is a flask in Hampstead, definitely.

57:50.273 --> 57:52.497
But you definitely hide it.

57:52.517 --> 57:55.362
He said five blocks from where we would be here.

57:55.542 --> 57:58.287
And we passed it on the taxi track.

57:58.407 --> 58:01.593
My wife saw it.

58:01.633 --> 58:03.015
Did you come over the top in the taxi?

58:03.075 --> 58:03.336
Yes.

58:03.857 --> 58:04.217
Ah, yes.

58:04.237 --> 58:06.261
Well, then he would pass the track.

58:06.281 --> 58:07.623
You must have been down.

58:07.643 --> 58:10.508
We came up this way and down here.

58:10.809 --> 58:12.231
Yeah, that's right.

58:16.683 --> 58:37.307
Well, I'll be happy to send you a part of this piece here.

58:37.387 --> 58:43.534
I have your address, so I have your postal address.

58:43.700 --> 58:50.027
Thank you.

58:50.047 --> 58:55.733
Well, thank you so much, Jim.

58:55.753 --> 59:12.191
We have a lot of famous papers, the Philadelphia Inquirer will be using this story, and the Cleveland, Ohio paper, and the papers of the West Coast.

59:12.211 --> 59:12.692
They have a lot of that.

59:12.712 --> 59:13.032
It's quite nice.

59:13.518 --> 59:21.515
I was about to ask if there was a cat.

59:21.535 --> 59:27.968
Well, yesterday he guessed, and you know what you didn't know when you see Mary.

59:27.988 --> 59:28.690
What's the thing I'm talking about?

59:28.710 --> 59:29.051
Well, not really.

59:29.071 --> 59:31.155
I guess, you know, we're on the head of it.

59:31.372 --> 59:40.182
Yes, you do.

59:40.343 --> 59:48.993
And then you just hit a little bit next to the top of your feet and then go on up.

59:49.013 --> 59:49.954
The double will go on up and get down.

59:49.974 --> 59:51.736
I'm just going to get down here up to George because I think it's just kind of nice too.

59:51.756 --> 59:52.116
If you don't mind.

59:52.136 --> 59:52.557
No, I don't mind, no.

59:52.577 --> 59:53.338
This is kind of nice with the brick.

59:53.358 --> 59:54.639
May I take one more?

59:54.659 --> 59:55.200
Thank you.

01:00:00.907 --> 01:00:01.227
There you go.

01:00:03.215 --> 01:00:07.567
I'll get Eddie.

01:00:07.587 --> 01:00:10.094
No, no, he's all right.

01:00:10.977 --> 01:00:12.401
Thank you.

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:16.853
Come on, Eddie.

01:00:17.845 --> 01:00:37.959
Well, I just decided you to... Right over here.

01:00:37.979 --> 01:00:38.520
Thank you, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:38.740
Thank you.

01:00:56.168 --> 01:01:01.723
What do I have?

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:52.681
That's a good show.

01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:52.982
Good question.

01:01:53.002 --> 01:01:53.382
That's a good show.

01:01:53.402 --> 01:01:53.783
That's a good show.

01:01:54.539 --> 01:02:21.864
I've been done a thousand of the times.

01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:21.964
Huh?

01:02:21.984 --> 01:02:22.304
What's going on?

01:02:22.324 --> 01:02:22.645
What's going on?

01:02:22.665 --> 01:02:22.985
What's going on?

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:23.325
What's going on?

01:02:23.345 --> 01:02:23.666
What's going on?

01:02:23.686 --> 01:02:24.006
What's going on?

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:49.632
What do you think about that?

01:02:49.652 --> 01:02:49.912
I don't know.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:50.192
I don't know.

01:02:50.212 --> 01:02:50.473
I don't know.

01:02:50.493 --> 01:02:50.753
I don't know.
