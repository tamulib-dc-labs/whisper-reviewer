WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.498
I had one around here.

00:03.518 --> 00:04.079
Hold this one.

00:04.099 --> 00:16.153
Go get one, yeah.

00:16.173 --> 00:16.593
Okay, good.

00:17.114 --> 00:19.297
Well, I'm really sorry I couldn't get in the other day.

00:19.357 --> 00:22.100
Thank you very much for your understanding.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.822
He got me out early.

00:24.102 --> 00:24.883
He got me back earlier.

00:25.424 --> 00:26.545
Oh, that's good.

00:27.166 --> 00:30.431
It must be quite a feeling to have this book here.

00:30.891 --> 00:35.558
You know, this is 30 years of work.

00:36.179 --> 00:40.885
I just can't imagine how that feels for a writer to hold this thing.

00:40.906 --> 00:46.213
I mean, as an object, as much as what it represents, maybe we could just start with that.

00:47.355 --> 00:56.768
Well, about the book itself, you know, when I started out 30 years ago, I would look at Hemingway's 49 stories and play the fifth column and say, I don't know how anybody could

00:57.136 --> 01:01.401
write so much, but it must be a great feeling to get them all in one book.

01:02.082 --> 01:06.067
Because I wrote, you know, maybe ten times as many stories as Hemingway.

01:06.187 --> 01:10.913
So this is a selected collection, but it's the same feeling that I projected for him.

01:11.134 --> 01:13.476
Right, it's a retrospective collection too, of course.

01:13.997 --> 01:15.799
It's a retrospective collection as well.

01:15.819 --> 01:18.082
I understand it's a selected collection.

01:18.102 --> 01:20.645
Yeah, it is.

01:21.527 --> 01:22.688
It's a retrospective.

01:22.988 --> 01:32.946
You know, it contains some of my best stories, but not, you know, I had to select them out of, I had to select them selectively, you know, for style and for theme.

01:33.307 --> 01:38.276
But there are other stories that I feel are just as good, but I feel a little disappointed that I could put them in.

01:38.296 --> 01:40.299
Well, there'll be another volume, maybe.

01:40.420 --> 01:44.006
That's what I'm hoping, and that's what I've asked my agent to submit.

01:44.046 --> 01:47.292
But I guess it would depend, since this is such an expensive collection.

01:47.643 --> 01:49.368
for the publisher to produce.

01:50.331 --> 01:53.460
And I don't know how many, you know, I don't know what the rewards will be.

01:53.821 --> 01:56.428
Well, you couldn't be, I'm so thrilled.

01:56.589 --> 02:00.981
I just, I'm just signing my first book contract with Holt.

02:01.503 --> 02:03.087
With Alan, as a matter of fact.

02:03.742 --> 02:08.768
And I don't know how you got to Alan Peacock, but he's wonderful.

02:10.050 --> 02:13.754
You've basically done most of your books with smaller publishers, right?

02:15.416 --> 02:21.744
So this is kind of a... Well, this is the first one in 15 years with a major publisher.

02:21.784 --> 02:26.830
The last one was in 1979 with Quite Contrary and 78 with Too Late with Paul Monroe.

02:27.704 --> 02:33.732
How do you, I mean, do you feel now that you'll be reaching, I mean, I've read conflicting things on this.

02:33.772 --> 02:36.355
On the one hand, of course, you want to reach the larger audience.

02:36.956 --> 02:43.805
But on the other hand, you know, you're writing, I guess, from what I can gather from the various things I read, that you are writing, you know, first for yourself.

02:44.346 --> 02:44.606
That's right.

02:44.626 --> 02:46.248
And everything else takes care of itself.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.792
Maybe you could address yourself to that.

02:48.852 --> 02:51.355
Is there a conflict there?

02:51.435 --> 02:57.323
No, no, because, you know, if this had happened 20 years ago, of course, I couldn't have had a retrospective like this.

02:57.539 --> 02:58.921
then it might have turned my head.

02:59.402 --> 03:01.624
But I don't think anything's going to turn my head by now.

03:01.965 --> 03:05.890
In fact, people accuse me of being a little too blasé about it.

03:06.511 --> 03:08.654
Because by this time, I'm expecting the worst.

03:08.794 --> 03:20.610
I'm expecting no reviews, no attention, and sort of a disgruntlement from the publisher that nothing came of this very expensive project of theirs.

03:21.012 --> 03:23.457
But it certainly won't turn my head if I get a few more readers.

03:23.518 --> 03:25.261
That's fine.

03:25.322 --> 03:35.865
But I will continue to write for myself since it's paid off emotionally and spiritually and aesthetically in the past.

03:36.419 --> 03:42.167
You know, a success could only, if you let it sway you, could only kill your work.

03:42.187 --> 03:42.287
Yeah.

03:43.488 --> 03:47.514
Coincidental to this book, I just wrote a piece.

03:47.614 --> 03:50.418
I did an interview with Robert Giroux on the Elizabeth Bishop Letters.

03:50.458 --> 03:51.900
Yeah.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.422
And she's from around here.

03:53.802 --> 03:55.805
That isn't what sparked my interest.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.828
I'm just fascinated by the subject.

03:57.848 --> 04:02.314
But here's a woman whose corpus is probably 80 poems.

04:03.215 --> 04:03.355
Mm-hmm.

04:03.335 --> 04:08.541
A tremendous volume of letters, of course, but they were not intended for publication.

04:09.102 --> 04:12.887
You, on the other hand, seem to have no problem writing these things.

04:12.907 --> 04:27.705
I mean, tell me a little bit about this creative process of yours, say, as opposed to the person like Elizabeth Bishop who will take 16 years to write one poem, you know?

04:27.685 --> 04:35.995
As an example, it took me five and a half years to write Frog, which I wrote every single day except the days that we were traveling to and from Maine.

04:36.576 --> 04:40.321
And the day after I finished it, I started the short story.

04:40.841 --> 04:43.505
I thought I would give myself a couple of days.

04:44.726 --> 04:57.422
But there were obviously stories that had nothing to do with this immense novel, Frog, that were sort of brewing in my consciousness or subconsciousness.

04:57.723 --> 05:05.874
And I just said, well, every day, if I finish something, the next day I always start something, at least I try to, just to see what's in there.

05:06.234 --> 05:15.186
And if nothing is in there, I'll find out in an hour or two when, you know, when not so much that the page is blank, but that the page is filled with clock trap.

05:17.188 --> 05:22.515
For me, you know, I'm happiest when I'm writing, and the truth is, so is my family.

05:22.985 --> 05:26.130
Because if I'm not writing, I get a little testy.

05:26.451 --> 05:41.116
And my joke is that my wife, you know, that I've been wanting to quit for the last 15 years, but my family has questioned me to continue writing simply, you know, for the betterment and peace and tranquility of the household.

05:41.857 --> 05:43.660
What would you do if you weren't writing?

05:44.078 --> 05:45.961
Well, you know, I do have this teaching job.

05:45.981 --> 05:48.064
That's a gig, though.

05:48.104 --> 05:51.989
That's a convenient gig, I bet, though, just between us.

05:53.171 --> 06:02.204
Yeah, it's a lot of work, though, because I'm a very conscientious teacher, and sometimes I have three classes a semester plus.

06:02.224 --> 06:03.266
That's a lot.

06:03.626 --> 06:05.128
But I get it over with.

06:05.268 --> 06:11.217
I mean, to me, teaching is sort of, you know, it gives me the money to write.

06:11.551 --> 06:15.017
But what I would do is, I don't know, I'd read more.

06:15.497 --> 06:18.362
I don't have enough time to read.

06:18.843 --> 06:23.250
I've read someplace where you're bored by the work of your contemporaries.

06:24.693 --> 06:27.337
Yeah, well, most of it is the same old thing.

06:27.617 --> 06:30.262
It's more cerebral than emotional.

06:30.462 --> 06:37.153
It's work which rarely takes any chances with style, prose.

06:37.657 --> 06:40.862
And I don't see anybody going forward.

06:41.243 --> 06:47.172
Is it the fault also of the publishing industry and the editors to think the people, what they want?

06:47.192 --> 06:50.417
I mean... But I read little presses too.

06:50.917 --> 06:51.619
Say again, I'm sorry?

06:51.679 --> 07:01.213
I read the work that comes out of little presses that the big ones won't publish and it doesn't seem much better than the big ones.

07:02.415 --> 07:05.520
In fact, sometimes the big ones seem to take greater chances.

07:05.855 --> 07:10.559
The big ones can lose a little money, and the little ones can't, it seems.

07:11.280 --> 07:19.588
I am sort of bored by my contemporaries.

07:19.848 --> 07:23.371
It's true that I haven't read all of them.

07:23.431 --> 07:25.213
But I would just see what I would do.

07:25.393 --> 07:33.060
If I wasn't writing fiction, I might be writing more plays, one-act plays, or drawings.

07:33.614 --> 07:44.593
I've always sort of had been artistic since I was a boy, so I was always doing something, either theater or poetry or painting or drawing or trying out something.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.436
It was only writing, you know, when I was about 22.

07:46.536 --> 07:49.060
You know, that I found what I really wanted.

07:50.703 --> 07:55.912
I thought perhaps that you might have done the jacket illustration for the book, but I see that somebody else did that.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.997
What I did, see, they wanted a photograph.

07:59.112 --> 08:03.216
I thought that was too self-centered.

08:03.537 --> 08:05.519
I don't like photographs of authors on the cover.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.762
I certainly didn't want my person on the cover.

08:08.902 --> 08:16.690
What I did was send them three self-portraits, drawings that I quickly did off of a window reflection.

08:18.071 --> 08:21.115
They liked the idea, but I doubt they liked the portraits.

08:21.155 --> 08:24.478
But they were as grotesque-looking as the cover that

08:24.796 --> 08:26.739
they have now, but not as artistic.

08:26.819 --> 08:28.222
I like the cover, by the way.

08:28.242 --> 08:28.742
Yeah, I do too.

08:28.822 --> 08:30.345
In fact, I love the production of the book.

08:30.365 --> 08:31.246
Yeah, I do too.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.191
There's never been a book that I've been more proud of.

08:34.692 --> 08:35.473
It's wonderful.

08:36.795 --> 08:45.549
Not only because of its bulk, but because of its design, and of course because of what it means to me as a writer.

08:45.990 --> 08:50.938
I can't tell you when this book came in and I showed it to my wife the day before.

08:51.813 --> 08:55.119
Holter just made an offer to write my book, you know.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.386
And I didn't even know this was an Alan Peacock book.

08:58.406 --> 09:01.472
And later I learned, I said, Connie, look at this.

09:02.634 --> 09:03.415
Isn't this beautiful?

09:03.636 --> 09:04.658
I thought you were in the right firm.

09:05.319 --> 09:05.800
Say again?

09:06.040 --> 09:10.209
I knew I was because they're taking a chance with me.

09:10.269 --> 09:11.311
My book is huge.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.597
And one of the arguments against it is that

09:14.577 --> 09:17.191
that it won't sell to the chains.

09:18.015 --> 09:22.056
Life and death in publishing today comes down to whether or not

09:22.660 --> 09:26.887
They're confident that you can sell to the chains.

09:27.629 --> 09:29.272
That stinks, if I may say so.

09:29.832 --> 09:32.417
Worthiness and unworthiness are irrelevant, it seems.

09:33.799 --> 09:36.684
You can understand what it's like with short stories, too.

09:36.704 --> 09:37.466
It's like poetry.

09:37.486 --> 09:38.367
Yeah, short stories.

09:38.588 --> 09:39.289
I'm amazed.

09:39.509 --> 09:40.952
But look at the collections, though.

09:40.972 --> 09:46.221
I mean, you've got your book, and I'm doing it with Grace Paley in a couple weeks.

09:47.062 --> 09:55.592
Yeah, but I mean, I think that there almost has to be the stature of a Steve Dixon and a Grace Paley to get a big book like this.

09:56.874 --> 09:58.676
But then again, you know, how many other?

10:00.017 --> 10:02.360
Tell me a little bit about the short story.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.263
You do write in so many different forms.

10:05.023 --> 10:08.167
And you finished Frog, and the next day you started on a story.

10:08.187 --> 10:08.668
Is that right?

10:08.728 --> 10:10.590
Well, the next day I started on a one-act play.

10:11.131 --> 10:12.032
A one-act play.

10:12.052 --> 10:14.835
And then I did four of those.

10:14.855 --> 10:16.377
And they're actually story plays.

10:16.930 --> 10:20.874
where I published three of them as short stories in magazines.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.317
It's really just one narrator, so I could pull that off.

10:25.218 --> 10:31.485
Do you do these with the idea that they will be produced, that they will be done on the stage?

10:31.705 --> 10:34.127
Well, I sent them out, but I've had no luck so far.

10:35.669 --> 10:46.600
Yeah, I would like them to be produced, but it's a whole other market that I'm aggressive about selling my short stories to magazines, but I'm not familiar with the...

10:46.985 --> 10:48.687
with a theater market at all.

10:48.807 --> 10:53.032
So I just... But I'm just wondering about the creative process here when you're writing.

10:53.773 --> 10:56.256
Are you in fact thinking, are you visualizing these things?

10:56.276 --> 10:57.377
Do you see them on the stage?

10:57.397 --> 11:00.561
No, no, it's about with a line, which I do with everything that I start out with.

11:00.721 --> 11:03.644
I have almost no idea what I'm going to write when I sit down.

11:04.285 --> 11:10.572
All I know is that I'm going to sit myself at this manual typewriter on a small desk and start writing.

11:11.373 --> 11:14.697
And, you know, sometimes a line comes...

11:14.947 --> 11:22.473
It comes to me before, but nothing more than a line and usually never an idea, meaning a concept of what I want from that story.

11:23.114 --> 11:25.416
So I just sit down and type that line.

11:26.296 --> 11:31.181
Usually it's a piece of dialogue or a very, very simple line to get myself into the story.

11:31.781 --> 11:37.666
And then something answers it, and then I'm on my way, and something answers it back.

11:38.307 --> 11:44.852
And I have a dialogue either between two people or an interior dialogue.

11:45.220 --> 11:46.301
And that's how I start my work.

11:46.441 --> 11:49.165
And I just continue to work on the first draft.

11:50.026 --> 11:52.248
Usually, you know, it takes me an hour, an hour and a half.

11:52.729 --> 11:56.593
And even if it's a 20, 25-page story, I'm a very fast typist.

11:57.915 --> 11:58.856
And then it's done.

11:59.397 --> 12:01.139
And then the first draft is done.

12:01.199 --> 12:03.622
And then I say, well, do I have something or not?

12:03.682 --> 12:06.385
And if I don't have something, I say, discard it.

12:06.719 --> 12:10.364
but I like the idea, so I'll rewrite it, and I'll write it in a different way.

12:10.524 --> 12:11.245
Do you throw any?

12:11.365 --> 12:11.926
You say discard.

12:11.946 --> 12:13.148
Do you throw any of this stuff away?

12:13.188 --> 12:20.477
Oh, yeah, I throw everything away that I don't use because my feeling is that it will come back in some other form, a better form, a more spontaneous form.

12:20.758 --> 12:31.572
While if I sort of pick through my runes, I'm just going to get, you know, I'll pick through them, I'll get words and ideas, but I won't get the feeling that produced it.

12:32.253 --> 12:36.118
And I feel that sort of urgency when I'm writing has to be

12:36.402 --> 12:39.167
in the work that I'm writing.

12:39.908 --> 12:42.412
There has to be a certain immediacy.

12:42.873 --> 12:51.027
So you're not leaving any entrails to be poured over by the graduate students 50 years from now or 100 years from now?

12:51.248 --> 12:59.642
No, except some rejected short stories from 30 years ago, 20, 30 years ago, which I have

12:59.993 --> 13:04.358
in my drawers, and I don't know why.

13:04.398 --> 13:05.479
Yeah, but those are finished works.

13:05.499 --> 13:06.961
I'm talking about the stuff, you know.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.122
No first dress, no.

13:08.763 --> 13:09.263
Too bad.

13:11.866 --> 13:18.794
You know, in a way, it gives me a better feeling to throw away work.

13:19.915 --> 13:24.300
Because, as I said, it will come back.

13:25.962 --> 13:28.465
It will come back in another form, much, much better.

13:29.086 --> 13:35.894
Don't you think the student, the scholar, would like to see these?

13:38.256 --> 13:43.923
My book, incidentally, is about the preservation of documents and collecting and archival things.

13:44.483 --> 13:49.228
I just believe everything should be saved, but that's me talking.

13:49.288 --> 13:57.878
The reason I don't do it also is because if I feel that the scholar is going to look at my old work, then I'm going to be too self-conscious about it.

13:57.858 --> 14:01.404
You see, I admire you for this.

14:01.464 --> 14:03.647
I mean, Kafka says destroy the stories.

14:03.667 --> 14:07.093
Well, if he really wanted them destroyed, he should have destroyed them himself, right?

14:07.113 --> 14:08.175
That's right.

14:08.235 --> 14:09.437
So you're doing this.

14:09.798 --> 14:17.470
I'm doing the job, and I'm not sort of putting any moral mind on anybody after I pass on.

14:17.450 --> 14:21.336
The same thing happened with some of these Elizabeth Bishop letters she writes at the very end.

14:21.356 --> 14:22.458
Now, destroy these letters.

14:23.059 --> 14:24.140
And they didn't.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.387
So then the person would say to Giroux, well, she told me to destroy them.

14:28.407 --> 14:30.951
She said, well, she's been dead now for all these years, and you didn't.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.194
So now you owe it to posterity.

14:33.214 --> 14:35.077
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

14:35.097 --> 14:35.317
Go ahead.

14:35.337 --> 14:36.059
No, no, no.

14:36.079 --> 14:37.641
But see, I don't agree with Giroux.

14:38.202 --> 14:39.223
I tell other people.

14:39.263 --> 14:41.307
Some people have asked, what should I do with your letters?

14:41.327 --> 14:42.288
They said, get rid of them.

14:42.568 --> 14:43.089
They're worthless.

14:43.109 --> 14:44.892
They're just between you and me.

14:45.361 --> 14:51.345
And I'm not interested in what scholars feel about my work or the future of my work.

14:51.425 --> 14:53.413
I'm just interested in what I'm doing at the moment.

14:54.170 --> 15:01.842
And after a story is done, you know, I could look back and say, gee, you know, I admire that, I wonder how I did it, but I certainly don't want to repeat it, because then I'll be repeating myself.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.327
You're not, now let's rewind the tape a tad here.

15:05.387 --> 15:07.891
You're really not interested about the future of your work?

15:08.271 --> 15:08.552
No.

15:08.572 --> 15:09.754
Want to examine that a bit?

15:10.395 --> 15:11.076
You're not?

15:11.096 --> 15:14.621
I'm not, you know, they're published, and that's it for me.

15:14.641 --> 15:15.703
Now I'm on to the next thing.

15:16.324 --> 15:22.573
Because if I, all I'm interested in is having a good time when I'm writing, is to explore...

15:22.756 --> 15:47.025
myself through my writing is to have some fun to do something original stylistically with each work and then it's done and usually I forget my work if I finish it because I've written so much and then I'm on to the next one this keeps every single new work fresh so all I'm interested in is the next work

15:47.562 --> 15:50.826
is in completing the work that I'm doing and getting on to the next work.

15:52.428 --> 15:58.176
So I have to think then that putting together this collection was not an easy task then?

16:00.318 --> 16:02.301
Because you're going back over completed work.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.524
I put it together in about an hour.

16:04.824 --> 16:05.485
Come on!

16:06.186 --> 16:09.490
I looked at all my work.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.634
I've had some favorites.

16:12.874 --> 16:15.738
In the past, people have asked me, what are your favorite stories?

16:15.798 --> 16:17.400
I'll say, my favorite stories are the ones where

16:17.701 --> 16:19.604
I made a breakthrough.

16:19.624 --> 16:24.110
For instance, you know, Mac and Love, Streets, Milk is Very Good for You.

16:24.351 --> 16:31.120
Stories where if I repeated them, I'd be repeating myself and I wouldn't be an original writer.

16:32.162 --> 16:36.348
And so there are about 20 or 30 stories in there that stand out.

16:36.388 --> 16:37.590
For instance, Grace Clause.

16:37.610 --> 16:46.122
I mean, if I did a story like that in that particular language with those very, very short sentences and that kind of emotional flow that goes...

16:46.388 --> 16:49.953
it would be a Dixon story.

16:50.034 --> 16:55.482
It would be a repeat, as if I have nothing else to say and no other way to say it in.

16:55.842 --> 17:00.229
So there are stories that have stood out in the past.

17:00.249 --> 17:09.142
And then I very quickly looked through and said, well, okay, you have two writer stories or one writer story in here, no more writer stories.

17:09.884 --> 17:12.868
You have several love stories, no more of that.

17:13.388 --> 17:16.934
But what made it easy was that I wanted something from every book.

17:18.236 --> 17:30.435
And so I just sort of chose the ones that over the years, you know, I felt were my favorites from every book, but that would not sort of conflict stylistically or structurally or...

17:30.702 --> 17:32.924
or story-wise with the others.

17:33.045 --> 17:33.625
No, it really did.

17:33.645 --> 17:34.406
It only took me an hour.

17:35.447 --> 17:40.132
You remember back in, what was it, 78, there were the collected stories of John Cheever.

17:41.114 --> 17:47.100
And, of course, Cheever exercised similar control and selection over the book.

17:47.120 --> 17:59.494
Now, in the last couple of years, they were putting together the uncollected Cheever, which caused a tremendous... How would you feel about that, somebody sifting through the stuff and making their selection?

17:59.592 --> 18:00.273
I wouldn't mind.

18:00.974 --> 18:04.098
This would be stuff that has never... Not while I'm alive, though.

18:04.118 --> 18:09.624
I mean, it's sort of a new point because I'd be dead when it happened.

18:09.785 --> 18:16.052
So, you know, they could do what they want with my published prose that hasn't been in book form.

18:16.072 --> 18:23.962
But I've already put together a collection of about 50, 60 stories for if Peacock wants it.

18:23.982 --> 18:26.325
So this will, you know, take care of the immediate...

18:26.508 --> 18:42.172
You know, it's true that if somebody in the future, you know, put together the uncollected stories, and there are, you know, hundreds in little magazines, it would be interesting, you know, what somebody else thought about the work and whether it would hold up.

18:42.192 --> 18:44.054
But I think once you're dead, you're sort of safe.

18:44.435 --> 18:51.986
Not because you're dead and you won't have to hear the criticism, but, you know, there's the argument that, well, this is not the collection that he would have put together.

18:52.006 --> 18:52.707
I love that quote.

18:52.768 --> 18:53.729
I've never heard it before.

18:53.769 --> 18:55.772
Once you're dead, you're safe.

18:56.258 --> 18:59.481
I like it a lot.

18:59.561 --> 19:03.445
You talk again about... You must have liked jazz, right?

19:03.665 --> 19:04.105
No, I don't.

19:04.245 --> 19:04.666
You don't?

19:05.046 --> 19:05.927
I don't.

19:06.027 --> 19:10.031
I'm strictly... What do you call it?

19:10.871 --> 19:11.992
Serious classical music.

19:12.273 --> 19:12.673
Really?

19:12.873 --> 19:15.756
That goes back to Gregorian chants.

19:15.776 --> 19:19.199
Well, I'm a good Greek, and I know Gregorian jazz.

19:19.359 --> 19:23.683
And right up to what I think is the best 20th century music.

19:24.305 --> 19:28.090
Because there is almost a... A rhythm.

19:28.611 --> 19:29.893
Yeah, but not just that.

19:29.933 --> 19:33.398
The way you write is almost improvisational in some respects.

19:33.979 --> 19:34.920
I try to make it that way.

19:34.940 --> 19:43.993
What you've described as sitting down and, you know, listening for the tune and then just doing a riff or something and following it where it goes.

19:45.576 --> 19:50.142
Maybe am I missing... No, no, you're absolutely on the mark.

19:50.162 --> 19:52.185
I mean, that's the... You know, rhythm is one...

19:52.587 --> 20:07.114
thing that I try for, too, in a story, to sort of carry a story along just by its rhythm, and very often by the musicality of the prose, you know, sort of subtle rhyming that goes on in many of the stories, you know, in the language.

20:08.076 --> 20:12.925
But jazz, it's never, to me, you know, I hate to...

20:13.225 --> 20:19.413
you know, disparage or, you know, the great body of jazz lovers in this country, but I've never been interested in it.

20:19.433 --> 20:31.428
I mean, I used to be, when I was 12, 13 years old, when I heard Dizzy Gillespie, but once Dizzy Gillespie played a song on a trumpet, and it was based on a theme from Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony.

20:31.748 --> 20:32.849
And I was, I don't know, 12.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.131
It was, you know, an LP.

20:34.351 --> 20:36.154
Not an LP, but a 78.

20:36.794 --> 20:42.962
And I looked on it, I looked at the, you know, that little disc in the middle, you know, which says where, you know...

20:43.297 --> 20:44.260
Right.

20:44.602 --> 20:50.522
And it said, based on, you know, a theme from Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony, it was Full Moon and Empty Hearts.

20:51.076 --> 20:52.998
I think it's Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.940
And so I got Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony.

20:56.381 --> 21:00.004
And since then, I've been a classical music nut.

21:00.044 --> 21:08.532
So why listen to the derivation when you're going to go to the... He did a great job, but I wanted to hear the whole thing.

21:08.832 --> 21:08.952
Right.

21:09.152 --> 21:15.198
But in terms of your writing, I guess what I'm saying is you just, you are an improvisational writer.

21:15.218 --> 21:17.740
I mean, is that a stretch on my part?

21:17.960 --> 21:20.062
You're absolutely right, because I don't plan my stories.

21:20.082 --> 21:21.083
I keep no notes.

21:21.063 --> 21:29.172
I mean, if there's a note, it's just a single line that I'm carrying around to put on the typewriter if I have one.

21:29.252 --> 21:30.694
And then I say, well, try that line.

21:30.714 --> 21:34.418
You know, it's been dangling around or going around your head, and it seems like it would be a good line.

21:34.438 --> 21:40.585
You know, my instincts by now sort of know what might be a good line for the opening of a short story and which might lead to one.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.908
And so those are my notes.

21:43.489 --> 21:44.890
How about a big book like Frog?

21:45.331 --> 21:46.572
Frog was all in my head.

21:47.854 --> 21:48.034
Come on.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.597
I swear to you, I started it in Prague.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.584
You know, on, you know, by hand.

21:53.725 --> 22:03.460
I mean, I went, I had an experience where this guy tried to show me through Kafka's grave, and it was the wrong grave site, you know, and it was a Kafkaesque experience.

22:04.001 --> 22:09.109
And so I wrote it by hand, and I wrote it through, you know, for the next month by hand, and I completed it by hand.

22:09.325 --> 22:13.571
I typed it when I got back, and then I thought, well, this guy's a good character.

22:13.591 --> 22:16.956
What about an interconnected collection of short stories based on him?

22:17.657 --> 22:24.927
So I wrote an interconnected, and then sort of halfway through that, I had this whole design in my head about what I would do.

22:24.967 --> 22:29.393
I would do one on his mother, one on his sister, one on his brother, and that was it.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.631
And so I just carried it around in my head.

22:31.791 --> 22:35.775
I had the ending, you know, about an hour, about a year before it was finished.

22:36.236 --> 22:37.817
The whole thing just planned out in my head.

22:38.278 --> 22:41.481
So really you were just putting it down on paper there for a while.

22:42.362 --> 22:42.662
Excuse me?

22:42.722 --> 22:46.826
I mean, you were putting it, it was up there, so to speak.

22:46.846 --> 22:51.832
I mean, you were keeping up with what was in your head, I guess.

22:52.032 --> 22:58.198
Well, you know, I told myself to keep the design simple in my head so I could remember it.

22:58.634 --> 23:00.637
But it was all in my head.

23:00.697 --> 23:02.359
Nothing went down.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.982
Do you work when you're working?

23:04.022 --> 23:06.465
I mean, are you one of these dawn to dusk guys?

23:07.307 --> 23:11.373
Obviously, you were up for a run this morning, so you do take time for other things.

23:11.453 --> 23:14.117
But tell me a little bit about your work.

23:14.157 --> 23:23.070
The way I work is to get all the sort of nitty-gritty work, the essential work, meaning my schoolwork and my housework, out of the way so I could write.

23:23.931 --> 23:28.017
Because if I don't, then I feel that, well, I'll have to interrupt it to do this or that, or I won't

23:28.402 --> 23:30.504
be prepared for class tomorrow.

23:30.645 --> 23:31.866
So that takes a number of hours.

23:32.687 --> 23:36.771
Usually I do it in the evening so I can start in the morning.

23:36.792 --> 23:39.775
You know, first I have to get my kids out to school every day.

23:39.795 --> 23:40.776
My wife is unable to.

23:41.377 --> 23:45.942
And so, you know, that means getting up at 6 and getting the girl up at 6 and teaching and so on.

23:45.962 --> 23:49.866
And then I have about three hours of writing every day.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.068
And that's what I do.

23:51.568 --> 23:54.952
And you do all the primary work on a manual typewriter?

23:55.112 --> 23:55.793
Yes.

23:55.925 --> 24:00.651
So none of this number two pencil and yellow legal pad type stuff?

24:00.671 --> 24:02.753
No, it's a non-electronic manual.

24:03.414 --> 24:07.559
I have three of them because, you know, when one breaks down, I send it to New York to get fixed.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.802
You mean there are people that still fix them?

24:09.822 --> 24:11.124
Yeah, yeah, in New York.

24:11.664 --> 24:13.086
Nobody in Baltimore.

24:13.647 --> 24:13.807
Yeah.

24:13.927 --> 24:16.330
Let me go back, though, to, you know, you asked...

24:16.546 --> 24:21.172
I know I cut myself short about the writing process, how to write a short story.

24:21.772 --> 24:30.503
But, you know, after I finish this first draft in about an hour, an hour and a half, it's sort of, you know, it's a great release of, you know, creativity.

24:30.523 --> 24:39.113
And, you know, I feel, you know, wonderful that I have, let's say, if it's a work that I'm delighted with, that I have something to work on for the next month.

24:39.254 --> 24:43.779
Because that's usually how long it takes, three weeks to a month for an average short story to write.

24:43.799 --> 24:45.321
And what I do is I just rewrite it.

24:45.605 --> 24:47.106
that story page by page.

24:47.967 --> 24:57.656
In other words, I take the first draft of the original, the first page of the original draft, and I just rewrite it, and rewrite it about 30, 40 times on a typewriter.

24:57.676 --> 24:58.116
Wow.

24:58.336 --> 24:59.037
So it's finished.

24:59.637 --> 25:15.291
See, but always thinking that I must maintain, you know, I must sort of refine the work, but I also must maintain or retain the immediacy, you know, of the work, and also sort of the urgency that went into writing it.

25:15.946 --> 25:20.070
And then I go on to page two, and page three, and page four, and then I'm finished.

25:20.090 --> 25:23.154
And then I finish it, I get it photocopied.

25:24.095 --> 25:28.680
I go to work, I photocopy it, and then the next day I start another story.

25:30.201 --> 25:35.347
Now, with all these 30 and 40 earlier drafts, I think you said you'd discard them?

25:35.687 --> 25:36.628
Yeah.

25:36.648 --> 25:38.931
So there are no variant drafts that exist.

25:39.111 --> 25:40.232
Not recently.

25:40.381 --> 25:41.422
I used to discard them.

25:41.442 --> 25:49.753
I used to, in other words, turn over the page, and that would be my second, you know, that's where I would rewrite the stories on, you see.

25:49.773 --> 25:50.093
I see.

25:50.534 --> 25:58.504
But only in the last, I would say, three, four years, the Johns Hopkins Library has told me not to do this.

25:58.904 --> 25:59.965
Good for them.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.467
They have a collection of my work.

26:02.448 --> 26:04.271
So, you know, they don't buy it.

26:04.311 --> 26:05.292
I give it to them.

26:05.643 --> 26:20.988
And so only with, I think, the last, you know, since Frog and so on, I've kept the, you know, certain pages of the work in progress and getting them, you know, wrapped in strength.

26:21.008 --> 26:22.270
And God knows what they do with it.

26:22.671 --> 26:24.273
So that's what I do with my stories now.

26:24.434 --> 26:25.035
Well, that's good.

26:25.495 --> 26:26.577
I'm glad to hear that.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.747
Can you imagine what library would be able to contain, you know,

26:33.233 --> 26:34.515
All these drafts.

26:34.535 --> 26:36.757
You know, HRC out of Texas.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.641
When you read my book, if you read my book.

26:39.661 --> 26:41.523
I'm interested.

26:41.543 --> 26:48.552
My book is about bibliomania, madness, human nature, the passion for books, whatever.

26:49.854 --> 26:57.503
When you start, you finish the novel one day, you start a one-act play the next, or a short story, and you just...

26:57.483 --> 27:02.608
sit down to the typewriter and you see what happens.

27:02.648 --> 27:04.510
I mean, there's no character talking to you.

27:04.530 --> 27:05.271
There's no voice.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.092
No.

27:06.112 --> 27:06.412
Nothing.

27:07.913 --> 27:09.515
And it can start with any one of these things.

27:09.575 --> 27:10.676
It can start with a character.

27:10.756 --> 27:11.677
It can start with a voice.

27:11.737 --> 27:12.778
It can start with an incident.

27:12.858 --> 27:13.279
A voice.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.561
Because the voice is the thing that carries the story through.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.663
So you always do have a voice.

27:17.823 --> 27:17.963
Yes.

27:18.324 --> 27:19.805
But I don't know it until I sit down.

27:19.845 --> 27:23.369
See, I don't know what the voice or the style is going to be when I sit down to write.

27:23.789 --> 27:25.170
It just comes with the writing.

27:25.391 --> 27:26.832
The voice comes and the style...

27:27.065 --> 27:28.027
It seems to come with it.

27:28.990 --> 27:31.255
At what point does that voice have an identity for you?

27:31.796 --> 27:32.558
Right from the beginning.

27:32.879 --> 27:33.159
Really?

27:33.340 --> 27:34.723
Yeah, right from the first line.

27:35.305 --> 27:35.986
And you can hear it?

27:36.026 --> 27:38.131
You can actually hear a texture to it?

27:38.151 --> 27:38.713
That's right.

27:38.733 --> 27:44.787
It's sort of a rhythm that the line is written in, and somehow some voice is there in my mind.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.904
being transferred to the page.

27:48.125 --> 27:57.176
I mean, the numbers would suggest that you're most comfortable with the short story, but is that a fair statement?

27:58.517 --> 27:59.558
Well, not lately.

27:59.599 --> 28:10.352
Lately, I've sort of, you know, after Frog, and I did write about two collections worth of short stories, and then I wrote a collection and a half, and then I wrote, you know, four plays and about 20 stories.

28:11.132 --> 28:12.394
And then I started a novel.

28:12.627 --> 28:15.932
And it was maybe the second novel of my life that I started as a novel.

28:17.215 --> 28:17.815
I just started.

28:17.856 --> 28:20.640
I said, yeah, this might, you know, be a good novel.

28:21.582 --> 28:22.243
And I finished that.

28:22.663 --> 28:23.685
It took me two years.

28:23.785 --> 28:24.667
It's interstate.

28:24.927 --> 28:27.251
And I'll just plan to publish it next year.

28:27.712 --> 28:28.132
Oh, that's great.

28:28.152 --> 28:31.598
And I finished that December 30th and started the story December 31st.

28:31.949 --> 28:32.550
No, I don't know.

28:32.610 --> 28:35.115
Is there any poetry in your corpus?

28:35.375 --> 28:36.076
There used to be.

28:37.058 --> 28:40.985
I started off as a poet, meaning I thought of myself as a poet.

28:41.005 --> 28:45.293
But it came too easily, and it wasn't very good, I didn't think.

28:45.854 --> 28:54.008
And when I got my job at Hopkins, I really must have had several hundred poems and versions of them.

28:54.427 --> 28:59.152
which I decided that I had to make a break.

28:59.393 --> 29:05.600
You know, I was either a fiction writer or... I mean, I just felt that this was sort of baggage or garbage almost.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.041
And I put them all in a paper bag.

29:07.061 --> 29:07.862
You're going to hate me.

29:07.882 --> 29:10.105
Not a paper bag, a garbage bag.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.066
One of those black bags.

29:11.086 --> 29:12.467
And I put it down in front.

29:12.487 --> 29:17.633
And I didn't wait for the sanitation department to carry it off to oblivion.

29:18.068 --> 29:18.749
That's what I did.

29:18.769 --> 29:21.513
I like to turn off a light.

29:21.954 --> 29:22.395
I guess.

29:23.316 --> 29:24.118
That's a good line.

29:25.480 --> 29:29.907
I'm seeing these in terms of quotes for my own piece.

29:31.690 --> 29:40.463
Somehow, if it comes too easily, and if I don't apply myself rigorously over and over and over again, I don't feel it's hard.

29:40.824 --> 29:42.326
It's almost like a Puritan ethic.

29:43.288 --> 29:45.291
You have to feel a little pain, I guess.

29:46.199 --> 29:50.344
And, you know, I have to labor over it rather than pain.

29:52.387 --> 30:00.897
It's, you know, somehow... And then when I spoke to poets, I just wasn't getting the same thing that they were getting from poetry.

30:01.558 --> 30:06.123
And I don't regret having discarded these things.

30:06.624 --> 30:09.187
It made traveling lighter, you know, as I said.

30:09.287 --> 30:14.794
And I, you know, cut myself off from poetry.

30:14.814 --> 30:15.615
You know, if...

30:15.832 --> 30:22.024
If I'm a poet, then it will come after I finish fiction writing.

30:22.926 --> 30:27.756
But I did with Melville.

30:27.916 --> 30:32.806
Now, you write for yourself first.

30:33.227 --> 30:33.507
Only.

30:33.868 --> 30:34.870
Only.

30:35.103 --> 31:04.317
so so there are no vital signs out there for you i know that i as a writer and i'm now in seven newspapers or so uh i love to hear from the people out there and you know i mean if it's the toledo blade takes me there's 250 000 papers i just started with them you know to hear from one of the one of these readers is a kick that people are actually reading what you're doing and responding to it what for you are the vital signs yeah i don't get many responses

31:04.820 --> 31:12.168
You know, I could probably count them on my two hands after all these stories, and some in major magazines.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.393
But you don't need any vital signs, is I guess what I'm driving at.

31:16.413 --> 31:17.555
No, I don't.

31:17.575 --> 31:21.940
And, you know, one could listen to somebody, you know, first of all, I hate praise.

31:23.001 --> 31:24.442
I hate anybody saying good things about it.

31:24.462 --> 31:26.204
I feel embarrassed.

31:27.146 --> 31:31.511
And I don't particularly care if somebody has told me that they didn't like the story either.

31:31.711 --> 31:33.713
I don't like criticism.

31:34.148 --> 31:36.391
And I don't even let my wife see my work.

31:38.655 --> 31:45.926
She might see a page every 200 pages because I'm sort of unclear about it.

31:46.187 --> 31:50.593
Unclear as to whether I am doing the right thing with this line.

31:50.634 --> 31:55.341
So I'll give the page two versions of it and say, you know, which one do you like better?

31:57.043 --> 32:01.270
Because one has a line that's different than the other.

32:01.604 --> 32:07.052
I just, I don't, you know, you could believe in all the good things they say about you, you could believe all the best.

32:07.373 --> 32:18.330
Yeah, I wasn't suggesting praise per se, but I was asking what response, whether or not you get, and I do think there's a difference, you know, because...

32:18.310 --> 32:25.139
Yes, you say you're writing for yourself only, but of course writing is an exercise of communication.

32:25.780 --> 32:31.127
You're writing for yourself, sure, but you are expecting others to respond to it, I think.

32:31.167 --> 32:43.103
I expect that I would have a... If I'm writing for anybody, it's for myself, but also for a fairly intelligent audience who will be able to keep up with my work.

32:43.143 --> 32:47.068
I always think of writing stories, meaning...

32:47.369 --> 32:55.140
You know, it's not just tricks that I'm doing, you know, sort of cerebral tricks that only a few selected academics could understand.

32:55.180 --> 32:57.483
I'm certainly not writing for that reason.

32:57.503 --> 33:03.251
I'm writing, you know, real stories, really, you know, I'm trying to convey deep emotions.

33:03.451 --> 33:10.761
And, you know, I don't see why anybody couldn't, you know, pick them up with a certain reading background.

33:11.163 --> 33:17.013
But I couldn't fathom what my real audience is.

33:17.053 --> 33:28.814
I can't tell you how many writers, and I mean good writers, or certainly writers who are recognized as serious writers, tell you that fundamentally they see themselves as storytellers.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.519
Do you subscribe to that?

33:31.839 --> 33:33.542
I'm a storyteller and a stylist.

33:33.910 --> 33:38.835
I think that style is as important as a story.

33:38.855 --> 33:40.477
I just don't want to tell a story.

33:40.497 --> 33:43.460
I want to tell it in a particular way.

33:43.620 --> 33:50.187
And that particular way always seems to meet my storytelling writing, my rewriting.

33:50.327 --> 33:54.331
I mean, when I'm writing a story, I always seem to come up with a style.

33:54.991 --> 33:58.715
And then I recognize it while I'm writing it, and then, of course, I pursue it.

33:59.076 --> 34:01.538
Then I exploit it and make the most use of it.

34:01.822 --> 34:06.289
But I'm a stylist as much as a storyteller.

34:06.429 --> 34:07.231
I really feel that.

34:07.932 --> 34:10.015
You know what I mean.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.798
I know precisely what you mean.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.624
Simple storytelling isn't enough.

34:16.846 --> 34:23.357
It's just a story that's told usually in a fairly dead or mellow or...

34:23.523 --> 34:26.349
or, you know, ordinary language.

34:26.649 --> 34:32.982
But when we talk about writing for the sake of entertainment, you're talking about entertaining yourself first.

34:33.023 --> 34:38.454
If you're engaged, then the expectation is that others might be as well.

34:38.474 --> 34:38.754
That's right.

34:38.774 --> 34:43.945
And it's become more difficult for me to engage myself because I've gone through so many styles.

34:44.515 --> 34:50.543
But that's the challenge, too, and that's what makes writing for me continually exciting, is to go beyond what I've done.

34:51.304 --> 34:52.706
So now I'm writing stories.

34:53.227 --> 34:55.590
One was, in fact, just taken yesterday by Hoppers.

34:55.650 --> 34:59.355
I mean, a story that is maybe the most powerful story that I've ever written.

35:00.657 --> 35:09.409
And, you know, but it was very, very difficult to write, and it's becoming more difficult to write all the time because I...

35:09.592 --> 35:12.217
you know, I can't, as I say, reproduce.

35:12.457 --> 35:13.880
I don't want to reproduce what I've done.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.344
I want to go beyond it.

35:17.386 --> 35:25.781
And also, while the style is so complicated, I'm also trying to simplify it so that people will grasp the style.

35:26.281 --> 35:32.292
With such a large body of work, on the one hand, and

35:33.082 --> 35:38.691
your admission, I guess, that you really don't, once it's done, you don't go back to it.

35:39.032 --> 35:40.033
You don't read it again, right?

35:40.474 --> 35:42.978
Do you ever find yourself repeating yourself at all?

35:42.998 --> 35:44.701
I know you try not to, mindfully.

35:45.782 --> 35:46.003
Yes.

35:46.884 --> 35:54.016
That's what I meant when I write a first draft of a story, and I say, no, you've done that story, or you've done it in that style.

35:54.036 --> 35:55.378
So you remember everything you've done.

35:55.558 --> 35:56.760
Yeah, it's all there.

35:57.481 --> 35:59.865
I mean...

36:00.284 --> 36:06.234
You know, there's certainly, you know, after so many stories, there must be, you know, some repeats that I wasn't aware of.

36:07.396 --> 36:11.203
You know, even certain scenes that are repeated.

36:11.283 --> 36:19.196
I know that there's a story in Frog, you know, that I did in my first collection.

36:19.417 --> 36:25.427
It's called Boz, that story, and it's the same story almost, but retold.

36:25.848 --> 36:25.988
Mm-hmm.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.238
in a different style.

36:28.298 --> 36:33.626
But I could write two, three, four drafts of stories and say, no, this is a day of repeats.

36:33.806 --> 36:36.590
And so tomorrow, you'll have a better day.

36:36.610 --> 36:38.113
I've never had a block, you see.

36:38.173 --> 36:39.034
I've never had a block.

36:39.094 --> 36:40.176
I've never worried about it.

36:40.676 --> 36:45.804
I mean, after writing so many years, I know that something will always come.

36:46.265 --> 36:54.878
Now, if it doesn't come, then that might be a healthy sign that something that I'm absolutely unaware of is trying to come.

36:55.583 --> 36:58.306
But I've never had a block.

36:58.346 --> 37:02.010
It's always sort of just I've let my imagination ruin my writing.

37:02.410 --> 37:04.953
It just sort of always seems to come.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.936
And I've also been honest about what is crap.

37:08.716 --> 37:14.142
And I've never let a line exist in my prose.

37:14.262 --> 37:15.944
Now, other people might think, oh, that's bullshit.

37:15.964 --> 37:20.729
But I've never let a line that I wasn't absolutely satisfied.

37:20.809 --> 37:23.852
And I felt that I did.

37:24.085 --> 37:25.726
I mean, that it's perfect.

37:25.746 --> 37:28.929
I mean, you say you do 30, 40 drafts, whatever.

37:30.270 --> 37:32.492
But when do you know that it's done?

37:32.532 --> 37:34.193
How do you know?

37:34.454 --> 37:35.515
Ten drafts before.

37:35.535 --> 37:36.756
In other words, this is of a page.

37:37.156 --> 37:39.198
It's page by page once I've done the first.

37:39.318 --> 37:41.500
You won't go to page three until you finish page two.

37:42.060 --> 37:42.440
Is that right?

37:42.601 --> 37:43.001
That's right.

37:43.141 --> 37:48.766
And usually it's done ten draft pages before the last one.

37:48.806 --> 37:53.890
But since I work on a manual, sometimes I might have a smudge on it, or sometimes it's in

37:54.005 --> 37:55.968
You know, the A and D is AMD.

37:56.068 --> 38:02.940
You know, I've made a typo, and so I try to use the correct tape, you know, first erase it, and then I've screwed up, and then it's a mark.

38:02.960 --> 38:10.552
I said, no, something is telling me that you have to go over this page once more until it's visually perfect, and that's when I stop it.

38:11.854 --> 38:16.502
It's certainly aesthetically perfect, and also the page itself is visually perfect.

38:16.600 --> 38:24.106
Now, later on, that page is going to be messed up, you know, when a magazine sends the rewrites and so on, you know, the galleys.

38:24.687 --> 38:27.710
But for that moment, it has to sort of just look beautiful to me.

38:27.730 --> 38:28.650
So there is a physical.

38:28.670 --> 38:30.172
I mean, you have to feel the goods.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.114
You couldn't do this on a word processor.

38:33.134 --> 38:33.194
No.

38:33.214 --> 38:37.278
Oh, the word processor is... First of all, I don't understand the damn machines.

38:37.338 --> 38:38.939
I can't even work on an electronic machine.

38:38.959 --> 38:39.900
Yes, you can.

38:40.040 --> 38:40.701
I can.

38:40.721 --> 38:41.201
I've tried.

38:41.241 --> 38:42.262
You know why I can't?

38:42.282 --> 38:45.645
Because I need the keyboard action of a manual.

38:45.862 --> 38:47.344
I really have to bang away.

38:47.524 --> 38:49.006
It's an emotional experience.

38:49.266 --> 38:51.269
It's tactile as much as anything, isn't it?

38:51.289 --> 38:51.630
That's right.

38:51.650 --> 38:57.658
You know, it's a real visceral experience or a tactile, visceral experience that I have with my typewriter.

38:57.898 --> 39:02.103
That's why I keep, you know, breaking them because I really sort of go through them.

39:02.123 --> 39:03.145
I take very good care of them.

39:03.165 --> 39:10.975
I get them all clean once every six months, but I still break them because it's like a price fight, you know, sometimes.

39:11.258 --> 39:13.881
Where do you buy a manual typewriter when these go?

39:13.961 --> 39:14.922
I mean, can you buy them?

39:15.303 --> 39:19.568
Well, I have three that I bought from a guy on 42nd, East 42nd Street.

39:23.252 --> 39:24.633
What the hell is his name?

39:24.874 --> 39:25.374
Doesn't matter.

39:25.414 --> 39:28.538
Yeah, but he sold me, you know, Hermes.

39:28.778 --> 39:32.923
Hermes, so they're not table, they're standards.

39:33.544 --> 39:35.045
And he doesn't have any more.

39:35.086 --> 39:38.369
I've been trying to, I would like to buy two more, you know, just for the future.

39:39.090 --> 39:39.831
Yeah.

39:40.756 --> 39:42.399
I'm sorry, go ahead.

39:42.419 --> 39:43.321
He repairs them.

39:43.341 --> 39:43.982
He's wonderful.

39:44.323 --> 39:47.569
Send them in a box in UPS and he sends them.

39:47.589 --> 39:49.512
Bob Parker, I love a V Parker up here.

39:49.673 --> 39:56.385
I've had to read him a number of times and he used to say, I'll never get rid of that Underwood, you know.

39:57.496 --> 40:03.485
And once it's through that roll, the last time I went over there, he's got the big computer over there.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.829
And I said, well, what happened here?

40:05.849 --> 40:08.073
And he says, I've broken there.

40:08.113 --> 40:09.595
Couldn't find anybody to fix it.

40:09.635 --> 40:13.742
Tell him to give me a buzz, and I'll tell him exactly who it is.

40:14.002 --> 40:16.246
I think he's bullshitting me.

40:16.686 --> 40:19.090
To me, that's my problem with electronic.

40:19.190 --> 40:22.155
It's like most writing today.

40:22.215 --> 40:23.537
It's just too light.

40:23.990 --> 40:25.411
You have to feel the goods.

40:25.431 --> 40:26.572
You have to handle the goods.

40:26.692 --> 40:27.133
That's right.

40:27.573 --> 40:31.617
And with a word processor, well, you know, I just can't stand looking at the monitor.

40:31.637 --> 40:37.342
It's too complicated a machine, and it would sort of handicap me as a writer.

40:37.822 --> 40:40.225
I know that when I write, I do write on word processors.

40:40.285 --> 40:45.509
I love it, and I swear by it, but I have to have hard copy, too.

40:46.110 --> 40:53.997
There comes a point during the day I have to sit down with the paper and a pencil, and I have to slash over it, because it does read differently.

40:53.977 --> 40:56.020
on paper than it does on a screen.

40:56.040 --> 40:56.742
And that's a fact.

40:57.002 --> 40:58.845
That's a proven fact.

40:59.586 --> 41:04.294
Yeah, I love, you know, when you write on a manual, you have that fresh ink.

41:04.575 --> 41:05.476
That's right.

41:05.577 --> 41:08.321
My forearms are constantly covered with my own words.

41:09.002 --> 41:13.630
You know, because I lean on the paper and then it comes off on my forearm.

41:14.592 --> 41:17.757
I mean, I love the whole experience of sort of going to bed with my...

41:18.142 --> 41:23.209
Now, of course, your roots are in the newspaper business, right?

41:23.770 --> 41:25.272
Those are my early roots, right.

41:25.672 --> 41:30.058
And not so much newspaper, but journalism, reporting.

41:30.819 --> 41:33.783
We were a news service in Washington.

41:33.803 --> 41:37.809
First, I started with NBC News in New York when I was in college as a copy boy.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.032
I did that for two years.

41:40.687 --> 41:43.532
Oh, whatever that show was, that weekend show, Monitor.

41:43.552 --> 41:44.374
That was a great show.

41:44.434 --> 41:46.417
Yeah, and then I went to Washington.

41:46.437 --> 41:47.159
I remember that show.

41:47.700 --> 41:47.920
Excuse me?

41:47.940 --> 41:50.705
I said I date myself by remembering that show.

41:51.567 --> 41:57.798
And then I went to Washington for two years for a news service and, you know, covered Congress.

41:57.818 --> 42:04.450
And, you know, we handled, you know, radio, television, and a practice station in Worcester.

42:05.392 --> 42:06.073
TAG.

42:07.154 --> 42:10.497
It was a 50,000-watt station.

42:10.577 --> 42:12.698
We handled one in Boston and one in Worcester.

42:12.759 --> 42:20.445
Of course, I was always interviewing Kennedy and anybody who was from Massachusetts.

42:20.465 --> 42:29.153
And then I went to New York for Fawcett Publications as a magazine editor, then to CBS as a radio producer.

42:29.173 --> 42:29.994
So you worked around then.

42:30.034 --> 42:30.514
Yeah.

42:31.295 --> 42:34.858
And then when I sold my first story at CBS, I said, well, now you have to give up

42:35.125 --> 42:46.339
news work, because, you know, take the words of Gertrude Stein, take Gertrude Stein's words to Hemingway, you know, you begin sounding too much like a reporter and less like a fiction writer.

42:47.240 --> 42:53.047
And so I gave it up, and maybe I gave it up too early, because, you know, it was a struggle for 20 years.

42:53.427 --> 43:00.115
But boy, a writer's search sure does learn, I mean, you certainly do learn to live with rejection, though, don't you?

43:00.576 --> 43:01.297
Yeah.

43:01.497 --> 43:03.900
And it does build character as well, doesn't it?

43:04.285 --> 43:08.889
Yeah, I mean, I got my first novel published at 40, but I wrote my first novel when I was 23.

43:08.949 --> 43:15.616
That wasn't a novel that was published at, in fact, my first book was published at 40, and my first novel at 41.

43:15.756 --> 43:20.540
You know, but the old books, you know, they are certainly in a closet.

43:20.941 --> 43:30.850
In fact, they're in a closet at Hopkins, you know, the early dress of my, not the early dress, but the finished works of my first four novels, which, you know, I don't want to publish it.

43:31.555 --> 43:34.499
Yeah, you learn from rejection, but I didn't plan it that way.

43:35.020 --> 43:42.091
It was sort of a gift, though, you know, an undesired or wanted gift.

43:42.111 --> 43:47.519
I certainly wanted to be published early, and I tried, and I came very close when I was in my 20s and my 30s.

43:47.939 --> 43:54.049
But what happened, you know, but it just turned out that, you know, that they were always at the last minute rejected or, you know, thoroughly rejected.

43:54.369 --> 43:57.954
But it did build character, and it sort of gave me an audience of one, myself.

43:58.655 --> 43:59.757
If I had been published early...

44:00.023 --> 44:07.211
I might have been influenced early by editors, agents, booksellers, and the rest of them, and critics.

44:07.832 --> 44:09.293
So I would have been more vulnerable.

44:09.834 --> 44:15.280
Look at Peter Benchley, not to suggest that he's a writer in any way, but he just comes to mind.

44:15.881 --> 44:17.443
I mean, the first book is Jaws.

44:17.503 --> 44:18.203
I mean, that's it.

44:18.243 --> 44:22.268
He's doing versions of Jaws for the rest of his life, you know, because of the...

44:22.670 --> 44:25.233
The commercial success and the expectations.

44:25.694 --> 44:31.161
I'm not so sure he has it in him to be a writer of any kind of depth.

44:31.341 --> 44:35.907
There are some writers who will tell you they will not put down a word except for money.

44:36.588 --> 44:39.151
And I think money has always killed good writers.

44:39.852 --> 44:43.777
And that's one thing that I knew from this early on.

44:43.797 --> 44:48.643
But, of course, you could be influenced even though you have this sort of feeling of what something could do.

44:49.028 --> 44:51.711
But, you know, I was poor for 20 years.

44:51.971 --> 44:54.634
You know, I just took jobs to support my writing.

44:54.655 --> 44:59.961
And that ended up being, you know, sort of maybe even saving me as a writer.

45:00.501 --> 45:01.863
But I'd never write for money.

45:02.323 --> 45:04.085
You know, an agent says, well, how much do you want?

45:04.145 --> 45:04.926
You know, now I have an agent.

45:05.047 --> 45:06.628
I didn't have an agent for 20 years.

45:07.089 --> 45:08.571
You know, what do you want for this book?

45:08.631 --> 45:09.492
I said, anything.

45:09.512 --> 45:12.255
You know, I mean, money is not what I'm interested in.

45:12.775 --> 45:15.358
I'm interested in, you know, in being published.

45:15.378 --> 45:16.380
I said the same thing.

45:16.500 --> 45:16.740
Yeah.

45:17.193 --> 45:19.135
You regret it?

45:19.716 --> 45:22.438
Well, they apologized for how little money they were offering me.

45:22.458 --> 45:24.621
And I said, you're publishing my book, right?

45:25.482 --> 45:27.063
I said, you like my book, right?

45:27.083 --> 45:28.064
I said, you like my book?

45:28.084 --> 45:28.885
He said, I love your book.

45:28.925 --> 45:30.126
I said, that's all I care about.

45:30.707 --> 45:31.408
I said, you like it?

45:31.448 --> 45:32.149
He says, I love it.

45:32.669 --> 45:35.933
I said, then we got a deal.

45:35.953 --> 45:37.554
I said, no problem, you know?

45:37.574 --> 45:38.315
Then you're a writer.

45:38.455 --> 45:38.796
Yeah.

45:40.097 --> 45:44.061
You know, a hack or a man of commerce.

45:45.020 --> 45:48.124
You know, actually, I don't need an advance.

45:48.144 --> 45:49.526
I mean, you know, if a book makes royalties.

45:50.688 --> 45:52.451
You ask Alan what I said to him last week.

45:52.471 --> 45:55.936
I said, listen, the money you're giving me, I said, this is known as an advance, right?

45:56.737 --> 45:59.781
I said, maybe I'm 51, you know, maybe I'm an old schooler.

45:59.841 --> 46:03.346
I said, but if the book does better, I make more, right?

46:04.047 --> 46:04.728
He says, right.

46:04.768 --> 46:06.911
I said, well, then what's wrong with that?

46:06.932 --> 46:10.757
I said, that sounds like a good American deal to me, you know?

46:11.210 --> 46:14.894
So anyway, listen, I've taken up a lot of your Saturday morning time here.

46:15.415 --> 46:20.401
And if I want to send you something, what do I send it to the English department at Johns Hopkins?

46:20.421 --> 46:20.921
No, no, no, no.

46:20.941 --> 46:22.583
First of all, it's the writing seminars.

46:22.703 --> 46:23.064
Okay.

46:23.424 --> 46:24.666
But send it to me at home.

46:24.826 --> 46:25.166
Okay.

46:25.747 --> 46:29.091
And we do have a fax at work in case you want a fax.

46:29.111 --> 46:29.371
Okay.

46:29.852 --> 46:30.853
I'll give you that number.

46:30.873 --> 46:31.153
Okay.

46:31.534 --> 46:33.676
It's 410-516-6828.

46:35.458 --> 46:35.799
Okay.

46:36.940 --> 46:40.204
But my address here is 1315...

46:41.197 --> 46:41.658
Okay.

46:41.999 --> 46:44.646
Boys, B-O-Y-C-E-F-U.

46:44.666 --> 46:45.167
Okay, good.

46:45.588 --> 46:47.012
Baltimore, 2-1-2-0-4.

46:47.172 --> 46:47.352
Good.

46:47.673 --> 46:53.768
Now, if I send you also a copy of this book with an envelope to send it back, would you inscribe it for me?

46:53.869 --> 46:54.651
Oh, yeah, you bet.

46:54.931 --> 46:55.553
Great.

46:55.573 --> 46:56.836
Okay, we got a deal then.

46:56.876 --> 46:57.197
Okay.

46:57.869 --> 47:00.173
And if I have any other questions, I'll give you a ring.

47:00.333 --> 47:01.154
Okay.

47:01.174 --> 47:02.036
It's very nice.

47:02.056 --> 47:02.757
I've enjoyed this.

47:03.098 --> 47:04.199
When does your book come out?

47:04.219 --> 47:05.501
It'll be early next year.

47:06.363 --> 47:06.503
Uh-huh.

47:06.523 --> 47:07.224
God bless it.

47:07.445 --> 47:15.117
I'm very much interested in your subject matter, you know, because it's books and it's passion.

47:15.137 --> 47:15.718
It's passion.

47:15.818 --> 47:18.162
The title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

47:18.623 --> 47:18.763
Uh-huh.

47:19.267 --> 47:23.316
I mean, it's the passion people have.

47:23.336 --> 47:24.378
Is this for a collecting book?

47:24.999 --> 47:26.823
You're not going to learn anything about collecting.

47:26.843 --> 47:28.907
I'm going to shut off the tape recorder here.

47:30.651 --> 47:31.132
Say it again.

47:31.272 --> 47:33.978
Richard Maxey, N-A-C-K-S-E-Y.

47:34.078 --> 47:36.263
He's part of our humanities department.

47:36.547 --> 47:38.789
And he has a library that I've never seen.

47:39.670 --> 47:44.155
I mean, first of all, it looks like the Peabody Library downtown, which is beautiful.

47:44.175 --> 47:45.236
I don't know if you've ever been in that one.

47:45.256 --> 47:46.518
I've been to all of them.

47:46.758 --> 47:51.103
Well, he has thousands, thousands of books.

47:51.183 --> 47:53.105
I mean, it's just endless.

47:53.565 --> 47:56.368
And apparently he's read every single one of them.

47:56.388 --> 48:00.613
And when you talk to him, you really feel that he has read every single book that's ever been written.

48:01.015 --> 48:02.116
He's a bibliomaniac.

48:02.937 --> 48:03.798
And he's a teacher?

48:03.838 --> 48:05.079
A wonderful, wonderful man.

48:05.780 --> 48:09.484
Does he collect in a... He collects.

48:09.564 --> 48:11.786
I mean, does he collect these things as artifacts?

48:12.087 --> 48:17.693
Obviously, he reads them, but is it... Yeah, he has some very, very old books, too.

48:17.713 --> 48:19.875
I mean, 14th, 15th century.

48:20.496 --> 48:21.637
He teaches at Hopkins?

48:22.438 --> 48:25.781
Yeah, he's in the humanities program.

48:25.801 --> 48:26.302
Okay.

48:26.322 --> 48:27.343
I'm going to shut the tape.
