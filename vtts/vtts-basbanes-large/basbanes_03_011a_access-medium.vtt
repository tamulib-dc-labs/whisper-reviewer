WEBVTT

00:08.317 --> 00:21.610
Testing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

00:21.670 --> 00:25.734
This is Yancey Carruthers.

00:25.854 --> 00:26.615
Yancey Carruthers.

00:26.675 --> 00:28.016
Captain in the Army.

00:28.497 --> 00:29.678
Reservist or regularist?

00:29.698 --> 00:30.278
Yes, reservist.

00:30.659 --> 00:32.400
I joined the reserves in 1988.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.041
I see.

00:33.802 --> 00:35.083
And how long on active duty?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.555
I didn't do any active duty time.

00:38.016 --> 00:39.618
I've been a reservist the whole time.

00:40.439 --> 00:41.921
This is my second mobilization.

00:42.482 --> 00:45.606
I did a mobilization at Fort Riley, Kansas with the training division.

00:46.347 --> 00:52.216
This being the second time around, I landed over here about five months ago.

00:52.396 --> 00:54.098
When were you called up to active duty?

00:55.420 --> 00:55.841
This time?

00:55.861 --> 01:00.868
27th of September.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.307
Second time to Iraq?

01:02.367 --> 01:03.689
This is the first time in Iraq.

01:03.909 --> 01:05.411
It's the second time being mobilized.

01:05.531 --> 01:05.952
I see.

01:05.972 --> 01:13.581
The first time I was mobilized, I went to Kansas with the training division, and we helped mobilize all the other units that were coming over here for OIF-1.

01:13.601 --> 01:15.624
And what was your civilian occupation?

01:15.864 --> 01:16.925
I'm an emergency room nurse.

01:17.426 --> 01:17.866
Wow.

01:18.127 --> 01:20.510
Have everyone you trained for this?

01:20.530 --> 01:27.538
Well, I first started working in the emergency room at Ozarks Medical Center, the place that donated all the books.

01:27.658 --> 01:29.100
That was 2001.

01:29.435 --> 01:37.390
I originally started training as a nurse in 1992 in Waynesville, Missouri, and I just continued my education little pieces at a time.

01:38.573 --> 01:42.320
I'm currently an RN, and I work in that emergency department.

01:42.340 --> 01:46.247
Okay, so now you don't have a health care type job here with the Army.

01:46.267 --> 01:47.089
You're in public affairs.

01:47.238 --> 01:50.384
No, I work for the Coscom Surgeon Section here.

01:50.404 --> 01:50.864
I see.

01:50.965 --> 01:56.013
The Surgeon Section owns two of the offices in the Public Affairs building, so we're kind of tenants here.

01:56.274 --> 01:57.396
Oh, yeah, so you don't work.

01:57.516 --> 01:58.879
Right, I don't work for Colonel McManus.

01:58.919 --> 01:59.359
I'm sorry.

01:59.399 --> 02:02.285
See, he just told me I've got to talk to you, and I'm through a day.

02:02.305 --> 02:04.869
Right, and we've been in the same building for several months.

02:05.090 --> 02:08.475
So you basically occupy space that adjoins space?

02:08.536 --> 02:10.038
Right, we just share.

02:10.058 --> 02:12.182
So how did you get brought into this book?

02:12.382 --> 02:17.770
Well, my book project started back in November in Baghdad.

02:18.531 --> 02:20.274
Okay, so it's unrelated to this one here.

02:20.354 --> 02:20.574
Right.

02:21.015 --> 02:21.816
Okay.

02:21.836 --> 02:29.347
It started out, I heard a presentation there that talked about how Iraqi doctors learn medicine in English.

02:30.809 --> 02:33.373
So, uh... I'm sorry, how they what?

02:34.094 --> 02:35.376
How Iraqi doctors what?

02:36.999 --> 02:38.180
They learn medicine in English.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.162
They learn medicine in English.

02:39.182 --> 02:40.684
So they speak English and they read English.

02:41.609 --> 02:49.624
And they actually prefer having their medical textbooks in English.

02:49.685 --> 02:50.887
You just learned that while you were here.

02:50.907 --> 02:52.049
I learned that when I was in Baghdad.

02:52.951 --> 03:01.828
And there was an ongoing project that was going on to provide medical reference text to Iraqi healthcare clinics all over the country.

03:02.416 --> 03:08.506
Well, I contacted the person that gave this presentation, and she basically told me, you know, I have several of these projects going on right now.

03:08.526 --> 03:15.278
If you want to be involved in this, what I would suggest is that you talk to the local civil affairs folks, which was Captain Wormstadt.

03:15.298 --> 03:19.205
She was in the very end of the video there, and her owner said you'd meet her today.

03:19.225 --> 03:20.627
I hope she gets a chance to come in.

03:20.747 --> 03:21.909
Wonderful.

03:22.330 --> 03:26.517
She connected me with the Blob Hospital, because that's in her area of

03:27.307 --> 03:28.349
her work area.

03:28.710 --> 03:33.381
She is the liaison between all kinds of different Iraqi agencies, and that was one of them.

03:33.401 --> 03:36.227
So once the two of us connected, she said, yes, there's a need for those.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.474
You've got to go see the medical library.

03:39.514 --> 03:41.759
You need to go meet Dr. Kossam and see the hospital.

03:42.441 --> 03:44.325
How do you spell Kossam?

03:44.506 --> 03:46.009
Q-A-S-S-I-N.

03:46.430 --> 03:46.530
Okay.

03:47.337 --> 03:50.942
But she was able to say, you know, yes, there is a need.

03:50.962 --> 03:58.733
So at that point, I contacted Suzanne Smith, who was the medical librarian back at, back home, back at the Ozarks Medical Center.

03:59.013 --> 03:59.915
S-U-Z or S-U-S?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.517
S-U-Z-A-N-N-E.

04:01.537 --> 04:02.218
Okay.

04:02.238 --> 04:05.342
And at some point, Captain, just give me your email address.

04:05.422 --> 04:05.683
Sure.

04:06.444 --> 04:07.245
Do you have a card?

04:07.986 --> 04:10.910
I don't have a card, but I can, I can write that probably faster.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.352
Why don't you just write it right for you?

04:12.372 --> 04:12.472
Good.

04:12.492 --> 04:14.475
And just keep talking when you... Sure.

04:15.299 --> 04:30.658
once I contacted Suzanne she said you know I wanted to see if there was some interest back home and you wanted to see if there was some interest right I wanted to see if they would collect some books and send them over here because I had the contact I knew that I could use them if I could get them and the response that I got

04:30.892 --> 04:32.293
was just overwhelming.

04:32.353 --> 04:39.080
I was really expecting that they would send, you know, maybe a couple of boxes of some books that these guys could use.

04:39.601 --> 04:43.384
And what they sent was 20 boxes of medical texts.

04:43.404 --> 04:44.586
I had them stacked all the way up.

04:44.606 --> 04:45.827
Oh, that's fabulous.

04:45.847 --> 04:50.231
And there were over 150 textbooks, medical textbooks.

04:50.271 --> 04:51.032
Which is exactly what they wanted.

04:51.052 --> 04:51.232
Right.

04:51.312 --> 04:52.313
I mean, hard bound stuff.

04:52.493 --> 04:56.157
And then over 300 medical reference journals.

04:57.217 --> 04:58.378
to the periodical stuff.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.379
This is serious stuff.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.140
This is great.

05:00.160 --> 05:00.821
It really is.

05:00.841 --> 05:09.070
And about the same time as I got the contact with Suzanne back home, I was able to go out and do a site visit at the hospital.

05:09.090 --> 05:11.113
I went out to see, you know, what it was all about.

05:11.233 --> 05:12.414
I met Dr. Cossum.

05:13.015 --> 05:15.618
Very polite people when you meet him.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.840
He gave me a tour of the hospital.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.322
He showed me the different departments.

05:19.922 --> 05:23.106
I got to see the medical library as it existed at that time.

05:23.609 --> 05:25.312
A lot of the books were really old.

05:25.372 --> 05:30.199
They used photocopies of actual medical reference textbooks.

05:30.219 --> 05:33.584
They'll have a stack of photocopies that they used.

05:33.704 --> 05:36.429
Some of the things that they had were, they looked like they were older than me.

05:37.590 --> 05:40.395
So, you know, I knew that at that point that there was a need.

05:40.895 --> 05:46.103
I had established a relationship with Dr. Cosim and said, hey, this is a project that I'm working on.

05:46.123 --> 05:48.246
And the books arrived shortly after that.

05:48.627 --> 05:50.069
And this is about when?

05:50.089 --> 05:52.012
This was late January when we first went out.

05:52.032 --> 05:52.553
06.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.490
of this year.

05:53.550 --> 05:54.791
And you arrived here again when?

05:55.171 --> 05:56.352
September?

05:56.493 --> 05:58.094
I arrived here in mid-October.

05:58.214 --> 05:59.896
I came on active duty in September.

06:00.056 --> 06:02.178
So you put the same together in a couple of months, really.

06:02.478 --> 06:03.139
Really did.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.722
The project really started about the 1st of December.

06:06.742 --> 06:15.911
And it took a little while to collect the books back home and maybe six weeks just to get all of them together because we have over a thousand employees at the hospital.

06:16.231 --> 06:18.574
So they put out this mass email to everyone.

06:18.594 --> 06:19.114
That's great.

06:19.364 --> 06:19.725
It is.

06:19.825 --> 06:20.105
It's great.

06:20.125 --> 06:22.989
I'd like to contact Suzanne back at the hospital.

06:23.009 --> 06:26.214
I can give you... Actually, this is her contact number right here.

06:28.697 --> 06:32.462
It's the beauty of digital cameras.

06:32.602 --> 06:33.344
You know, it is.

06:33.604 --> 06:34.004
It is.

06:34.065 --> 06:41.575
Let me look on this board here.

06:43.090 --> 06:51.645
I don't think there's anything else on that board that's particularly sensitive anyway.

06:54.771 --> 07:00.080
This is what I have right here.

07:01.222 --> 07:02.124
But it was great.

07:02.585 --> 07:06.752
When we delivered the books, this was March the 10th that we actually made the delivery.

07:07.222 --> 07:14.830
and Dr. Kassim had assembled his team of physicians there in the medical library for the presentation.

07:15.371 --> 07:33.550
I wasn't really expecting any kind of a ceremony, but we were able to present the books, and the docs would come up and take a look at the books, and then they would take one, and then they would maybe pass it across the table, and they were really excited.

07:33.570 --> 07:36.553
There was a lot of excitement, really seeing exactly what they had.

07:37.175 --> 07:39.358
and they're all looking for something.

07:39.379 --> 07:48.273
A pediatrician's looking for the American Journal of Pediatrics, and when he finds that, you know, it's just, okay, I'm going to take these and put them over my little pile.

07:48.333 --> 07:48.753
It's great.

07:49.675 --> 07:54.603
Well, are they going to have one central library over there, or are these going to... See, they have a library now.

07:54.643 --> 07:56.245
They have the facility for it.

07:56.265 --> 08:02.616
They have some nice shelving, some brand new shelving, but the books that were on it were just not adequate.

08:02.636 --> 08:03.537
Isn't that a great...

08:03.989 --> 08:05.472
Now, are you going to try?

08:05.492 --> 08:11.903
It's too bad you can't get stuff like this going with some of the... You know, this was a neat project for me.

08:11.943 --> 08:16.491
It was a lot of personal satisfaction because it wasn't really part of my job.

08:16.811 --> 08:21.319
It wasn't something that I had to do in order to be doing my job.

08:21.580 --> 08:25.306
But it was something I kind of took on as a side project.

08:25.987 --> 08:29.153
But it really felt like that... And obviously with the...

08:29.605 --> 08:46.153
It made me feel like I was doing something over here that I had actually made a little bit of a difference with what we're trying to do.

08:47.595 --> 08:51.782
It was very important to me that

08:53.737 --> 09:01.607
not just someone in my position had affected the change, but this is something that I personally feel like I have a great sense of accomplishment.

09:01.627 --> 09:15.745
So did you kind of have a sense that they needed the books, or was this just something that... See, I didn't realize that they needed them at all until I heard, because I'm very new to the Middle Eastern culture, never been over here before, but when I heard that

09:16.940 --> 09:41.193
that Iraqi doctors spoke English and that there was a shortage of medical reference textbooks, I thought, you know, I work with hundreds of doctors that have probably got these things laying around their garage or put up on the shelf somewhere, and if we can get things that are five years old, that is so much more modern than what the Iraqi doctors have access to.

09:41.213 --> 09:44.878
In a lot of these books, the material really doesn't degrade.

09:44.998 --> 09:46.660
Sometimes it's just the, you know,

09:46.977 --> 09:50.425
A book can only be flipped through so many times before it's just torn up.

09:50.846 --> 09:55.417
To know that they use these photocopies, that stuff is just not going to last.

09:55.437 --> 09:59.487
And this is not the type of stuff they can get online either, right?

09:59.507 --> 10:03.096
You know, they probably could, but these books are expensive.

10:03.413 --> 10:05.395
Very similar to college textbooks.

10:05.415 --> 10:06.897
That's right.

10:06.977 --> 10:10.741
You're absolutely right.

10:10.761 --> 10:13.063
You have to subscribe to the journals.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.325
It's going to be $20,000 a year.

10:14.345 --> 10:14.845
Sure.

10:15.746 --> 10:19.910
In some instances, some of these journals are very expensive.

10:20.791 --> 10:27.278
It's something that the Ministry of Health provides all the things that they need in the hospital.

10:28.039 --> 10:30.822
However, just as in the United States, with

10:31.004 --> 10:34.009
Medicare or insurance companies or that sort of thing.

10:34.029 --> 10:36.554
There's a priority against that.

10:36.574 --> 10:39.319
First, you have to have medical supplies, medical equipment.

10:39.339 --> 10:43.126
Medical reference books are further down on the list of priorities.

10:43.426 --> 10:50.619
They're needed, but in the eyes of a lot of officials, they're not needed as badly as some of the other things.

10:50.639 --> 10:50.819
Sure.

10:51.300 --> 10:55.628
Do you realize if everyone, how many hospitals are there in Iraq?

10:55.945 --> 10:59.710
This is something you did for one hospital.

10:59.790 --> 11:05.697
This hospital serves the town of Balad, which is 75,000 people, but it also serves the surrounding area.

11:06.278 --> 11:10.964
Their area influence includes about 300,000 in the population.

11:11.164 --> 11:12.466
It's a very small hospital.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.767
Did you give me the name of the hospital?

11:14.128 --> 11:15.690
It's Balad General Hospital.

11:15.710 --> 11:18.694
Balad General Hospital.

11:18.714 --> 11:21.497
That's what they call themselves.

11:21.537 --> 11:22.659
You must feel pretty good about this.

11:22.679 --> 11:22.939
I do.

11:23.079 --> 11:25.362
I really feel great about this project.

11:25.814 --> 11:43.134
This was a really neat project, and one of the things, I think, that made it even more interesting, if I can find it for you, this right here is a translated copy of a press release that was put out by the Iraqi media.

11:43.154 --> 11:43.915
May I have a copy?

11:43.935 --> 11:45.537
Yes, I'm printing out a copy right now.

11:46.799 --> 11:51.024
The gentleman's name was Sabah Abazi, and I may get you wrong.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.125
It is, it is.

11:53.206 --> 11:55.669
He was an Iraqi reporter that was there

11:56.088 --> 11:57.149
to cover this event.

11:57.649 --> 12:02.374
I mean, completely independent of everything that we were doing, this Iraqi reporter was here to cover this.

12:03.234 --> 12:07.939
And some of his information that he got on that is not entirely correct, like 101.

12:08.139 --> 12:11.001
I don't know what 101 means.

12:11.402 --> 12:16.106
It's not part of our unit designator, but yet he reported some things that weren't entirely accurate.

12:16.126 --> 12:24.053
But he did get a good concept of the story, that it was something that was a cooperative effort between the doctors in Balad and the soldiers here.

12:24.590 --> 12:34.062
which I think that's really the most important thing when we're dealing with the Iraqis, is that there was a cooperative effort, and we are doing something good with them.

12:35.143 --> 12:49.160
He sent me this via email, and then I had it translated from Civil Affairs, and he told me that it would be, basically would travel from here northward, so it would end up in cities like Mosul and Kirkuk.

12:50.142 --> 12:52.825
He's not a newspaper reporter, I thought he was initially,

12:53.378 --> 12:57.742
He speaks fair English, but it was pretty difficult to communicate with him, and I misunderstood that.

12:58.222 --> 13:03.347
I think he's some kind of a broadcast journalist, maybe radio, but he took some digital photos, too.

13:04.268 --> 13:10.174
So I'm not really sure if it's going to end up maybe as a little TV spot somewhere.

13:10.194 --> 13:11.575
So this just happened, really?

13:11.795 --> 13:15.458
This was last Friday.

13:15.619 --> 13:16.639
And when did the books come in?

13:16.980 --> 13:20.483
The books came in the latter part of January.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.030
We were gone.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.193
We were out in Al-Asad, out west.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.958
And then they came right before we went to Al-Asad.

13:27.998 --> 13:29.701
So then we were out there for a week.

13:29.721 --> 13:34.888
It takes a little bit of time to arrange a trip to do this kind of thing.

13:35.549 --> 13:38.093
So we needed the inventory of the books.

13:38.353 --> 13:41.277
We didn't know how long that was going to take because, again, this was a side project.

13:41.297 --> 13:45.263
There are normal, everyday things that I have to do as well.

13:46.725 --> 13:50.250
But we were able to set a date

13:51.192 --> 13:53.855
on the 10th of March to get this done.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.078
So what's next for you in the book area?

13:56.819 --> 14:01.765
Well, OMC has indicated that they are willing to do a little more.

14:02.265 --> 14:03.126
OMC again?

14:03.347 --> 14:06.010
Ozarks Medical Center.

14:07.311 --> 14:15.041
They had another physician, one that I've worked with for several years, that he came up with three or four more boxes of textbooks that he wanted to donate to the cause.

14:15.762 --> 14:18.245
And now it's very targeted.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.326
I know that

14:19.593 --> 14:24.943
based on the initial shipment of what they sent and what the capabilities are, I know I need pediatric books.

14:25.023 --> 14:26.406
I know I need neurosurgery books.

14:26.466 --> 14:30.354
So now it's narrowed to four different fields.

14:31.416 --> 14:36.686
We had great response in the surgery area, great response in the emergency area, family practice.

14:37.127 --> 14:42.377
So those physicians, they have the reference text that they need now, but there were a few that

14:42.830 --> 15:00.267
We sent two pediatrics references to the pediatrician, so we're going to try to increase those specific areas, and they're going to try to buy a few books and then try to target the collections at this point.

15:00.628 --> 15:03.390
I can probably expect there will be another shipment April or May.

15:03.711 --> 15:11.318
I don't know how large it's going to be, so I haven't made any promises to the Iraqis yet about what more will be coming.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.783
I will get a second shot.

15:13.803 --> 15:17.908
I'll get something in the Los Angeles Times about this.

15:17.968 --> 15:19.150
Really?

15:20.111 --> 15:21.974
This is a great story in my view.

15:21.994 --> 15:22.695
Congratulations.

15:22.715 --> 15:23.676
I'm very impressed.

15:23.696 --> 15:24.257
Appreciate it.

15:24.457 --> 15:24.937
Appreciate it.

15:26.359 --> 15:37.374
It would just be so nice if we could get some of your colleagues to pick up on this example and try and do what you have done for the general hospital and other hospitals throughout Iraq.

15:37.694 --> 15:40.478
It is so important that we...

15:41.217 --> 15:53.753
not only do we have a good relationship with the Iraqis, because that's what this is all about, but that we don't just help them, we give them the tools that they need to help themselves.

15:54.033 --> 16:09.132
And that's where this medical reference book project is just so effective, because I haven't really done anything for them, but I've given them the tools that they need to help themselves,

16:09.753 --> 16:10.674
So there's a little difference.

16:10.895 --> 16:13.278
You know, teach a man to fish versus give a man to fish.

16:13.859 --> 16:15.361
And that's very important.

16:15.381 --> 16:18.024
But not just that, the attention of the Iraqi media.

16:18.585 --> 16:20.708
That will have an effect on what we're trying to do here.

16:21.569 --> 16:24.533
The Iraqi public opinion, obviously, is very important.

16:24.553 --> 16:29.139
And what happens if we get a national exposure on this?

16:29.219 --> 16:32.904
I mean, all of a sudden, people around the United States want to give books.

16:32.924 --> 16:34.967
What happens then, if that should happen?

16:35.648 --> 16:37.330
You know, if that should happen...

16:38.255 --> 16:40.577
I'm sure there's a need in places.

16:40.657 --> 16:43.700
Is somebody prepared to coordinate that here?

16:43.720 --> 16:47.243
Do you understand what I'm saying?

16:47.263 --> 16:47.844
I do.

16:47.864 --> 16:50.826
That would be hard.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.808
It's the kind of thing people would respond to.

16:53.249 --> 16:53.569
It is.

16:55.170 --> 16:56.792
There would be avenues to do that.

16:57.553 --> 17:01.816
Of course, that would involve a needs assessment on a little bit larger scale than just a lot.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.638
A little more than what I could do alone.

17:05.300 --> 17:08.042
If there was a larger response, then

17:08.630 --> 17:11.754
You know, I think we could figure out a good place to put some of these.

17:11.774 --> 17:12.776
And how old are you, might I ask?

17:13.136 --> 17:13.497
I'm 34.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.238
Good for you.

17:14.618 --> 17:15.279
Do you have family?

17:15.559 --> 17:15.840
I do.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.522
I do have a wife, three children.

17:17.542 --> 17:19.505
And they live in?

17:19.705 --> 17:20.386
All in Missouri.

17:20.406 --> 17:20.907
All in Missouri.

17:21.107 --> 17:21.507
A-L-T-O-N.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.829
A-L-T-O-N.

17:23.470 --> 17:23.750
Great.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.032
Great story.

17:25.092 --> 17:25.853
How old are your kids?

17:27.235 --> 17:30.700
You know, I always have to think about that because there's three of them and then they have birthdays.

17:31.541 --> 17:33.243
My oldest daughter is 11.

17:33.804 --> 17:34.405
What's her name?

17:34.525 --> 17:34.865
Amory.

17:35.386 --> 17:36.848
A-M-O-R-I-E.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.505
And my middle daughter is Gabrielle.

17:40.546 --> 17:41.147
She's seven.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.731
And then Tabitha is five.

17:43.851 --> 17:44.352
Three girls.

17:44.372 --> 17:45.294
I got two girls myself.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.556
And what's your voice name?

17:46.576 --> 17:46.716
Melody.

17:48.519 --> 17:48.740
Melody.

17:48.760 --> 17:48.960
Fabulous.

17:49.321 --> 17:50.002
It's a great story.

17:50.463 --> 17:51.084
Thanks.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.307
Thank you for sharing it with me.

17:53.327 --> 17:58.276
And will I be able to, well, I guess Brian will get me a copy of the CD that we watched earlier?

17:58.436 --> 17:59.538
Yes, he can get a CD.

17:59.638 --> 18:03.004
And I have a copy of the pictures if you have questions.

18:03.355 --> 18:24.185
If we got a larger response to this, what that would involve is me coordinating with civil affairs units all over the country and determining exactly what the need was before any books were sent.

18:24.205 --> 18:28.991
That would be really important because we wouldn't want to all of a sudden have a warehouse full of books and no need for them.

18:29.011 --> 18:30.173
And also not focused.

18:30.490 --> 18:30.850
Right.

18:30.870 --> 18:34.054
It would have to be focused on, hey, this is exactly what we need.

18:34.454 --> 18:39.159
Because in some of these things, you know, you have to make sure you have an outlet.

18:39.339 --> 18:45.165
And that's the way I did it this time, is I made sure that I had a place to go with him.

18:45.185 --> 18:48.528
And then at that point, I already knew that there was some interest back home.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.010
But I said, hold off.

18:50.070 --> 18:53.554
I'm doing anything until I can get the connections made.

18:53.574 --> 18:57.037
And then once I knew what the need was, I said, yes, there's a need.

18:57.057 --> 18:57.878
This can be used.

18:58.739 --> 18:59.940
You know, go ahead, green light.

19:00.781 --> 19:11.240
And so it would all have to be, a larger effort would have to be done the same way to make sure that you had a focused effort on the facilities that needed the most, needed the most help.

19:11.260 --> 19:17.070
And what's the largest big city pavement there where you live?

19:17.150 --> 19:18.673
I'm not really close to anything.

19:18.993 --> 19:21.037
South Missouri is kind of out there.

19:22.099 --> 19:24.443
Springfield need leader maybe.

19:25.013 --> 19:25.954
St.

19:25.974 --> 19:26.715
Louis, of course St.

19:26.735 --> 19:29.258
Louis, Kansas City, there are some people that get those.

19:29.278 --> 19:39.651
We have a little local paper there in West Plains.

19:40.132 --> 19:50.785
It helps us out so much because not only are we helping the Iraqis, we're getting some good public exposure here to the Iraqis.

19:51.575 --> 20:07.857
And I think it's also so important that the American people know that everything they hear on the news, sometimes, I mean, you know how this works, and being a member of the media, sometimes the good stories, something like this, this is not news.

20:08.317 --> 20:15.266
This is something that is a great story, but if it happens this week or next week or the week after, it's not really time-sensitive.

20:15.286 --> 20:15.947
It's a good story.

20:16.628 --> 20:20.013
Well, you do have an angle that something would happen.

20:20.033 --> 20:20.213
Sure.

20:20.233 --> 20:20.333
Sure.

20:20.600 --> 20:25.607
You know, but as far as a helicopter crash is news.

20:25.687 --> 20:27.249
I mean, it's right then, it just happened.

20:27.849 --> 20:39.064
You know, so you hear about so many bad things, and I think it's important, especially, you know, because there's so many troops that are over here, you know, that the support of the troops is important.

20:39.885 --> 20:46.334
And so I think it's important that the American public knows that, you know, we are over here, we are doing some good things, and the Iraqis are making progress.

20:46.354 --> 20:49.037
And did you have the support of your superiors on this?

20:49.692 --> 20:51.734
one of my military superiors.

20:52.475 --> 20:54.357
They were in the conference with that guy with me.

20:54.377 --> 21:02.426
So I introduced the idea to the COSCOM surgeon and he just kind of let me run with it.

21:02.486 --> 21:05.108
We have a really good working environment over here.

21:05.129 --> 21:11.876
Each of us, we have a dietician who's in other medical operations planning and we all have our little projects that we're working on.

21:11.936 --> 21:15.019
So there's a degree of autonomy in our jobs.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.703
So there's a lot of support from that from my boss.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.693
It says, you know, hey, this sounds like a great project.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.034
This is something we want to do.

21:23.895 --> 21:31.423
And, you know, there are some, there are maybe even some other good things that can come out of this because of our improved relationship.

21:31.784 --> 21:33.305
What's your brother's name?

21:33.345 --> 21:34.266
Colonel Christensen.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.410
Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N.

21:38.371 --> 21:44.117
Last name Christensen, C-H-R-I-S-T-E-N-S-E-N.

21:45.785 --> 22:15.083
check it out if that's an email maybe i'd like to get a quote from him if not now when i get back he will be around here sometime today so all right i think so thank you um i'll be in touch sure can you work for the so why don't you just tell me i'm talking with captain come on

22:16.919 --> 22:17.379
Okay.

22:17.439 --> 22:19.722
This is Captain... I'm Captain Lana Wormstatt.

22:19.782 --> 22:20.542
Lana Wormstatt.

22:20.682 --> 22:24.226
And you are... Just tell us your name.

22:24.786 --> 22:26.188
Just tell me your name.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.709
Would you just say it?

22:27.729 --> 22:29.371
Captain Ahmed.

22:29.611 --> 22:30.311
I-H-M-A-G.

22:30.331 --> 22:30.712
Okay.

22:31.112 --> 22:32.453
And your first... That's his first name?

22:32.473 --> 22:33.254
First name.

22:33.354 --> 22:34.655
And your... And your... Second name.

22:35.236 --> 22:35.676
Hikmat.

22:37.558 --> 22:37.858
H-A-K-A-M.

22:38.339 --> 22:42.423
And you have... You wrote it down there for me.

22:42.443 --> 22:42.683
Yep.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.985
So...

22:45.370 --> 22:49.174
Colonel McNerdy tells me that you're involved in his book project.

22:49.415 --> 22:50.015
That's correct, sir.

22:50.055 --> 22:53.539
And Mike, could you just tell me a little bit about it, and your particular involvement?

22:53.840 --> 22:57.924
Well, I'm a civil affairs team leader out at Bob Palawada, the Balada area.

22:58.685 --> 22:59.847
What did you call it?

22:59.867 --> 23:00.627
Bob Palawada.

23:01.729 --> 23:02.830
P-A-L-I.

23:02.850 --> 23:06.094
Can you just see me trying to spell that out on the tape?

23:06.114 --> 23:14.263
Well, it's named after a soldier that was killed there on January 24, 2004, Captain Palawada.

23:14.783 --> 23:16.565
Can you write it down for me?

23:16.645 --> 23:16.745
Good.

23:16.765 --> 23:17.145
Roger, sir.

23:17.165 --> 23:17.986
I go to Palo Alto.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.350
And so what I do is I do civil affairs.

23:21.390 --> 23:25.193
I do deal with infrastructure projects.

23:25.213 --> 23:29.257
And how I came to be is I met with Captain Crothers.

23:29.338 --> 23:31.620
And he took him out to the Blatt Hospital.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.762
Because he said he's also a nurse.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.304
Now I'm a nurse in the civilian world.

23:36.865 --> 23:43.812
And he said he wanted this project of raising medical books if possible to get to the Blatt Hospital.

23:44.095 --> 23:51.045
So I said I'd take him out there, show him what the blood hospital has, does not have, because as a nurse, he could truly appreciate the needs of any person.

23:52.948 --> 23:55.191
So I took him out to the blood hospital.

23:56.212 --> 24:01.259
He met Dr. Cosman, the director of the hospital, and showed him around the hospital, the needs.

24:02.201 --> 24:05.666
And then Captain Crothers actually has done all the groundwork.

24:05.686 --> 24:09.391
I just took him out there and brought him back and took him out there again for delivery.

24:09.852 --> 24:10.913
And they raised...

24:11.365 --> 24:14.651
143 medical books and over 350 medical journals.

24:15.432 --> 24:17.535
And then we took them out there and delivered them.

24:17.555 --> 24:18.717
And then it's been a great mission.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.500
So you were the facilitator.

24:20.821 --> 24:22.243
Ah, yes, I got the facilitator.

24:22.263 --> 24:26.831
And tell me how you work with Captain Achmed.

24:27.272 --> 24:33.222
Captain Achmed, he's the company commander of 4th Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry Division for the Iraqi Army.

24:33.640 --> 24:38.167
He's also the civil affairs officer for the battalion, so he's my counterpart.

24:38.187 --> 24:47.441
Whenever we go out on missions, patrols, check-in projects, infrastructure, deal with government leadership, anything.

24:47.601 --> 24:51.927
I mean, yesterday we did a school project where we dropped off some canvases and paint.

24:52.268 --> 24:57.015
His soldiers help out with that, provide security along with my soldiers.

24:58.075 --> 25:00.397
We've been working together since I've been here.

25:01.458 --> 25:06.563
What is your regular daily duty?

25:06.583 --> 25:21.918
My job is civil military operations that deal with any infrastructure issues such as sewer, water, electricity, academics, agriculture, transportation, medical, fuel, you name it.

25:21.978 --> 25:26.682
Is there anything that deals with Iraqi people I'm involved with in making their life better?

25:26.948 --> 25:38.264
or providing assistance, and not necessarily doing it for them, but helping them to help themselves facilitate, and then finding different avenues to do things, different funding that's come down.

25:38.344 --> 25:39.226
We do projects.

25:43.592 --> 25:45.675
I'm shy.

25:50.261 --> 25:50.762
Very nice.

25:51.485 --> 25:57.155
Now, did you know about the need for books, or is this something that Kevin Carruthers basically generated?

25:57.316 --> 26:05.891
Well, part of my job, when a civil affairs team arrives in any location to take over their AO, they do an assessment.

26:06.472 --> 26:15.889
And so within the first week of arriving at Bob Palawada in Bilod, I went to the hospital and met with Dr. Cosman for the first time, director of the hospital.

26:16.105 --> 26:19.249
I sat down with him and found out what the needs and the wants are of the hospital.

26:19.569 --> 26:21.611
He showed me around, did an assessment.

26:21.832 --> 26:22.753
He showed me the library.

26:22.793 --> 26:28.239
The library is pretty sad.

26:28.419 --> 26:31.042
It would not even come close to the standards that we have in the U.S.

26:31.122 --> 26:31.963
or many other countries.

26:32.764 --> 26:34.306
Many of the books are 10 to 20 years old.

26:35.287 --> 26:37.490
They don't have covers or they're copies of books.

26:37.510 --> 26:38.571
They're copies of copies.

26:39.011 --> 26:41.134
Sometimes they're not up to date.

26:41.314 --> 26:43.817
The newest book might be 1998, 1999.

26:44.202 --> 26:45.904
That's ancient medicine, that's ancient history.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.667
It is, and so they can't keep up.

26:48.127 --> 26:49.810
And these doctors are very good doctors.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.433
They are trained down in Baghdad, just about all of them.

26:53.354 --> 26:54.716
They use the British system.

26:55.677 --> 27:01.485
They know English, maybe not as fluent as we are, but many of them speak very, very well.

27:02.046 --> 27:03.508
They're very efficient doctors.

27:03.528 --> 27:05.991
They have a neurosurgeon there who is brilliant.

27:06.632 --> 27:08.735
He's up to the power of our neurosurgeons.

27:08.775 --> 27:12.420
It's just that a doctor can only do as well as when he asks for equipment and supplies.

27:13.008 --> 27:19.598
And keeping up to date with the different, you know, technology that medical has, you know, how medicine changes so fast.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.020
I mean, it's hindering.

27:21.601 --> 27:25.086
But if they have the knowledge, they can practice this along with if they have the equipment.

27:26.027 --> 27:29.953
So Captain Crothers has really done an excellent job with getting the books for him.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.395
They're happy, extremely happy.

27:31.415 --> 27:32.757
Now how long have you been on active duty?

27:33.938 --> 27:34.559
I'm in the reserve.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.723
My unit's actually out of Abilene, Texas.

27:37.544 --> 27:39.446
So I'm a filler on this rotation.

27:39.507 --> 27:41.209
The unit that I'm filling in with...

27:41.662 --> 27:46.147
It's out of Mountain View, California, and they're short, so I volunteered to go with them.

27:47.168 --> 27:49.030
So I'm filling this, and I'll be done in May or June.

27:49.271 --> 27:50.091
And what's your day job?

27:50.672 --> 27:51.633
I'm an ER trauma nurse.

27:52.114 --> 27:52.995
And where?

27:53.015 --> 27:53.475
In Texas?

27:53.655 --> 27:54.536
In Texas, yes, sir.

27:54.556 --> 27:55.357
Where in Texas?

27:55.457 --> 27:56.539
Temple, Texas, Scott and White.

27:57.099 --> 27:59.262
And that is where in this huge state?

27:59.802 --> 28:01.104
It's right next to Fort Hood, basically.

28:01.124 --> 28:03.086
It's on I-35 next to Fort Hood.

28:03.106 --> 28:04.007
And when did you join up?

28:04.578 --> 28:05.819
Oh, 1985.

28:06.020 --> 28:07.922
It'll be 21 years in June.

28:08.342 --> 28:08.563
No kidding.

28:08.583 --> 28:09.684
Yeah, I came in when I was enlisted.

28:09.704 --> 28:10.966
I did nine years enlisted.

28:11.186 --> 28:13.088
And what was the motivation at that point?

28:13.789 --> 28:22.419
Well, I knew I wasn't ready for college, and I wanted the college money, and I wanted to travel, and I had a really good Army recruiter.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.624
And I got Germany, went to Germany for two years.

28:27.125 --> 28:30.028
Ended up in the Army, stayed for another three years, re-enlisted for another three years.

28:30.312 --> 28:32.735
And then I got out to go to nursing school because I knew it was in seventh grade.

28:32.755 --> 28:34.598
And this is about when did you get out?

28:34.618 --> 28:38.103
I got out in August 90, and I joined the National Guard.

28:38.643 --> 28:40.866
Ninety days later, I was back off for Desert Shield, Desert Storm.

28:40.947 --> 28:44.912
So I came to Saudi Arabia and came into Iraq.

28:45.893 --> 28:47.355
This is the first time?

28:47.415 --> 28:49.238
Yes, Desert Storm.

28:49.698 --> 28:50.459
I came from Desert Storm.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.784
And then I came back, finished up nursing school.

28:53.804 --> 28:56.708
My last year at nursing school, went through OCS, got my commission.

28:57.143 --> 29:00.988
I went to Navy OCS a long time ago.

29:01.208 --> 29:07.896
I went to South Dakota OCS program, and I took my branch transportation.

29:07.936 --> 29:09.138
I didn't want to be a nurse in the military.

29:09.158 --> 29:09.798
I love traveling.

29:09.838 --> 29:12.882
I like being outside, doing stuff.

29:12.902 --> 29:13.883
They want the jobs to be the same.

29:15.345 --> 29:20.992
So I did transportation, the core master of logistics, and then I decided I wanted to do some different civil affairs.

29:21.853 --> 29:24.516
And so when you were called up again for this?

29:25.397 --> 29:26.058
Yes, sir.

29:26.078 --> 29:26.779
And when was that?

29:27.248 --> 29:29.071
I got called up in March of 2005.

29:29.151 --> 29:31.635
How did you feel about that?

29:32.055 --> 29:32.516
I was excited.

29:33.317 --> 29:35.200
I've got the best job in the Army.

29:35.621 --> 29:36.142
Do you have a family?

29:36.462 --> 29:38.285
Yes, I have two children.

29:38.305 --> 29:39.988
And they're back in Texas?

29:40.008 --> 29:41.149
No, well, one is.

29:41.269 --> 29:41.971
One's in Texas.

29:42.371 --> 29:44.595
He's going to be a grandmother in August.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.118
Yeah, I know.

29:47.179 --> 29:48.641
That smile.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.422
No, I'm excited.

29:49.923 --> 29:52.286
And my other son is with my sister at Fort Gordon.

29:52.306 --> 29:53.248
He's a senior in high school.

29:53.268 --> 29:54.049
He'll graduate in May.

29:54.721 --> 29:56.824
My brother-in-law stationed at Fort Gordon.

29:56.844 --> 29:58.286
What are your boy's names?

29:58.706 --> 30:00.429
Adrian and Aaron.

30:00.469 --> 30:01.290
Congratulations.

30:01.310 --> 30:01.791
Thank you.

30:01.811 --> 30:03.933
They must be very proud of you.

30:03.953 --> 30:04.114
Yeah.

30:04.134 --> 30:04.574
They were little.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.076
I mean, they remember when I left for Desert Storm.

30:06.958 --> 30:10.362
So when Mom's been in the military for so long, it's just, you know.

30:10.382 --> 30:13.907
And you shouldn't ask a lady her age, but... 38.

30:16.210 --> 30:16.530
See?

30:16.551 --> 30:18.333
Did you hear that, Ahmed?

30:18.353 --> 30:20.977
You don't ask a woman her age.

30:22.078 --> 30:23.580
But unfortunately, with these...

30:24.016 --> 30:27.119
So how much time active duty have you got altogether?

30:28.020 --> 30:29.141
Must be 10 years?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.282
10, 11 years.

30:31.183 --> 30:32.364
I'll stay in until they kick me out.

30:32.384 --> 30:32.844
I love it.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.846
So you think you're going to stay active now?

30:35.027 --> 30:36.308
Well, I'll be in the reserves.

30:36.628 --> 30:37.069
I'll go back.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.151
I'm actually slated to go to Arabic school at DLI.

30:40.312 --> 30:42.294
I took the D-Lab test.

30:42.314 --> 30:45.597
So when I come back, I'll be going to Arabic school when they get me a slide.

30:45.617 --> 30:46.257
Good to you.

30:46.277 --> 30:46.678
Excellent.

30:46.698 --> 30:47.338
Congratulations.

30:47.358 --> 30:48.039
Thank you.

30:48.059 --> 30:48.780
I think we have plenty.

30:49.641 --> 30:50.301
That's right.

30:50.321 --> 30:51.602
I think I have plenty of information.

30:52.083 --> 30:52.183
Okay.

30:52.298 --> 30:52.679
Thank you.

30:52.939 --> 30:53.540
You're welcome.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.202
Thank you, sir.

30:54.262 --> 30:54.883
Thank you.

30:54.903 --> 30:59.271
Good luck to you with your country and working with a terrific lady here.

31:00.373 --> 31:01.475
Did you hear that?

31:01.495 --> 31:05.963
Did you hear that?

31:05.983 --> 31:07.626
Testing, one, two, three, four.

31:07.727 --> 31:10.071
Test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test, test.
