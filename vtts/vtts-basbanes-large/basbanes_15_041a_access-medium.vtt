WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:05.629
It is December 3, 1987.

00:05.669 --> 00:11.155
I'm in Boston to interview the playwright Arthur Miller at the Ritz-Falb.

00:12.516 --> 00:15.379
I've already done a little test on this, so I know it's fine.

00:15.619 --> 00:19.202
Okay, I guess I type up my questions.

00:19.883 --> 00:20.604
That's the best.

00:21.665 --> 00:23.286
I can't read my own writing.

00:24.488 --> 00:32.215
I think the structure of this book, and you have been quoted someplace, I don't know where, but that you kind of

00:32.633 --> 00:43.169
followed a similar structure as you did as a salesman, and that memory is considerably more important than chronology, and the title seems to indicate that, too.

00:43.269 --> 00:45.713
Maybe you could just tell me a little bit about that.

00:45.733 --> 00:49.559
Well, it's the same structure as Death of the Fall, actually.

00:49.579 --> 00:56.650
But it's, uh... I don't think that time has any place in recollection.

00:56.810 --> 01:00.075
We don't recall things.

01:00.545 --> 01:01.766
in relation to time.

01:02.067 --> 01:09.555
You recall them by virtue of their relation between one image and another.

01:11.397 --> 01:18.624
You recall because one thing obviously suggests another, rather than having anything to do with time.

01:18.644 --> 01:22.889
So, time is squeezed out of the book, in that sense.

01:22.909 --> 01:25.231
It's things more than... Yeah.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.153
It's relationships.

01:28.034 --> 01:28.695
Relationships.

01:30.076 --> 01:32.560
So I obeyed that rule.

01:33.481 --> 01:37.507
This has been more or less a guiding principle through all your work, I gather.

01:37.547 --> 01:38.989
That's right.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.033
I've been bending time a lot.

01:44.036 --> 01:50.165
And the title comes out of the, obviously, the structure.

01:50.185 --> 01:52.408
Did you have the title before you had the structure?

01:52.488 --> 01:53.690
Oh, no, no.

01:53.790 --> 01:59.678
I didn't get that, so I was almost finished with the book, and suddenly it seems to me to be

02:01.109 --> 02:06.797
What is it about death, death of a salesman?

02:06.817 --> 02:13.467
And I've written this sentence, and I'll just read it, that has resonated so powerfully over the past 28 years or so.

02:13.527 --> 02:18.955
What do we see in Lily's life that continues to move us so, that continues to speak to us?

02:18.975 --> 02:22.280
And it's an extraordinary phenomenon, this play.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.443
It is more than a play, I think.

02:24.463 --> 02:26.526
Maybe you can just tell me something about that.

02:27.215 --> 02:43.475
You know, I think it may just be that it's a one thing, it's a certain total embrace of a situation in a man that's really kind in anything.

02:43.495 --> 02:56.091
It's himself as a person, as a private person, as a father, as a lover, as a husband, as a man in society.

02:56.324 --> 03:03.150
in business, as a son himself, as a brother.

03:05.592 --> 03:14.900
Practically every side of his existence is in that place, and it's dramatizing.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.821
There's something magical about it.

03:17.462 --> 03:25.909
Any member of your colleagues have attempted to get any of those qualities into a play?

03:27.087 --> 03:29.570
absolutely total onslaught on December.

03:30.951 --> 03:34.816
But whether they did or not, I don't know the answer to the question.

03:34.856 --> 03:38.780
I think if we could answer the question, it probably wouldn't exist anymore.

03:39.521 --> 03:40.542
Don't leave it, don't touch it.

03:40.582 --> 03:54.558
I heard an interview that you gave here some months back, and somebody asked you, have you ever thought of rewriting these things?

03:54.578 --> 03:56.200
And I said, my God, what a thing to ask them.

03:56.483 --> 04:00.488
It's a silly question.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.311
It's a silly question, isn't it?

04:02.391 --> 04:18.752
I mean, I didn't even tend to—I was kind of— Well, they used to—I think it comes out of this dreadful habit that we have now of what they call updating something.

04:18.772 --> 04:26.322
In other words, you think because you put a different costume on Hamlet that it's going to change something.

04:26.740 --> 04:37.309
Of course, it doesn't do anything but make the director look a little classy, which is just a dumb question.

04:37.329 --> 04:40.112
The point is human nature remains the same.

04:40.292 --> 04:43.815
I mean, why does Camelot resonate today?

04:44.315 --> 04:50.180
Because the human condition is the same today as it was in the 16th century.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.262
I've read your short stories.

04:52.282 --> 04:53.523
I enjoy them.

04:53.563 --> 04:54.684
I've read your novel.

04:54.704 --> 04:55.785
I've read your prose.

04:56.457 --> 04:57.918
You are a man of letters.

04:57.938 --> 05:03.103
You're adept in many forms, and that you are a man of the theater.

05:03.123 --> 05:04.444
Why?

05:04.464 --> 05:05.345
Why do you choose?

05:05.645 --> 05:08.588
Well, I think it's partly... Let me just finish.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.009
It's double-pronged.

05:10.029 --> 05:15.754
Particularly when you consider the state of the theater, in this country at least, as it is today.

05:17.255 --> 05:18.476
Two questions, basically.

05:18.496 --> 05:21.359
Of course, I might not have been a man of the theater.

05:21.379 --> 05:24.101
I haven't played any of the conditioners today.

05:25.843 --> 05:26.363
It's...

05:28.452 --> 05:35.783
It's been betrayed in so many ways now that it barely breathes air.

05:37.385 --> 05:45.156
And when I came into it, I thought it was bad enough, but I never dreamed it would get to this.

05:45.176 --> 05:49.723
So, if I am a man in the theater, it's because there was a theater of some kind.

05:50.644 --> 05:53.869
There was a profession of the theater.

05:55.503 --> 06:02.732
And one felt it was putting your life into it.

06:02.752 --> 06:04.754
I'm not sure if it's true anymore in this country.

06:04.975 --> 06:08.199
It is true in other countries, but not here.

06:08.219 --> 06:15.768
But writing plays, what does that exercise do for you to say that writing stories does it?

06:15.868 --> 06:18.011
It's just what used to be called an event.

06:20.074 --> 06:22.877
It's the way my mind was formed.

06:24.055 --> 06:30.843
I think a playwright is, at least in some part, an actor.

06:31.363 --> 06:44.899
An actor, Manquet, he's an actor who forbids himself to act, or wants to act all the parts, or projects himself through dialogue.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.024
Let's say you could call it a deformation of the mind.

06:50.225 --> 06:53.809
That's the way one thinks, in terms of scenes.

06:55.747 --> 07:00.674
rather than in terms of the descriptions.

07:00.694 --> 07:04.480
I have thought that way since I began thinking.

07:04.500 --> 07:11.410
You mentioned at some point in the book the writing of dialogue.

07:11.450 --> 07:16.478
Either you have it or you don't, and there has to be a knack.

07:16.498 --> 07:23.188
I can't recall it for such words, but you have to have this knack of knowing that it's going to work on a stage.

07:23.573 --> 07:28.617
So many of us can write beautiful words that may read well, but to be spoken.

07:28.677 --> 07:52.078
There is a mystery about it, but the only thing I can tell you about it is that usually a stage-worthy line invites the audience to complete it somehow, to complete the image.

07:53.223 --> 08:00.491
The best theater is the theater that invokes the imagination of the viewer of the audience.

08:01.772 --> 08:14.965
And it's a difficult art because there's a question of how much to tell them, how much they should be asked to work at it.

08:14.986 --> 08:21.272
And a line, a good dramatic line, may say a lot, but it also leaves out a lot.

08:22.619 --> 08:27.404
And I can't be any more specific with that.

08:29.447 --> 08:34.372
The narrative dialogue obviously doesn't work.

08:34.392 --> 08:38.397
It doesn't have a kick whether your dramatic dialogue does.

08:38.417 --> 08:44.644
You mentioned that you invite the audience to participate in the process.

08:45.004 --> 08:50.230
You've also spoken about the film process, which perhaps goes too far.

08:50.783 --> 08:53.326
Death of a Salesman is a work of art.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.953
The set, The House of the Skeleton.

08:59.374 --> 09:08.305
But when the film version, the recent film version was done, there was a problem there of being too realistic, of going beyond the authority.

09:08.425 --> 09:17.837
I thought it came closest to achieving that in the film, in this last four-round.

09:18.172 --> 09:22.636
creating a set which was not really real.

09:24.859 --> 09:28.442
It's important for you that it not be entirely real, I think, is what I'm writing in.

09:28.462 --> 09:35.609
Well, the thing is, you see, the play is, I'm happy to say, gives people real emotions.

09:35.649 --> 09:36.590
It evokes real emotions.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.832
We have to bring our own baggage to it, apparently.

09:38.852 --> 09:45.799
But the truth of the matter is that the dialogue is not paper-corded with dialogue.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.423
But it takes good actors to realize that.

09:51.206 --> 09:52.528
And the actors know it best.

09:54.652 --> 10:14.402
So that the seeming realism of the play is created by a very highly condensed, highly selective use of language, which is not realistic speaking.

10:14.618 --> 10:19.503
Well, if there were a realist experience, the play would be seven hours long.

10:22.226 --> 10:22.647
That's right.

10:24.289 --> 10:28.433
You mentioned that after the extraordinary success of Salesman for a while, you felt blocked.

10:32.218 --> 10:33.239
How did you overcome this?

10:34.120 --> 10:38.264
Did you ever truly overcome it after such an experience?

10:38.284 --> 10:39.225
You certainly were productive.

10:40.287 --> 10:44.271
The most produced play I've ever written, I wrote right after that.

10:44.538 --> 10:47.701
It's just impressive.

10:47.721 --> 10:49.242
It's been produced more often.

10:49.262 --> 10:53.166
Twice as much, at least.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.588
It's my most famous play.

10:56.329 --> 10:57.530
Can you explain that?

10:57.550 --> 10:59.772
Well, sure.

10:59.812 --> 11:03.515
That's a wonderful play, and I know the play very well.

11:04.656 --> 11:09.220
There's a lot of places that you're thinking.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.144
I've got a play out in London now that many people think is my best play.

11:15.014 --> 11:21.120
So the baloney about being blocked is... I don't remember that.

11:21.140 --> 11:27.987
You expressed some apprehension about, how do I follow this?

11:28.388 --> 11:41.781
Maybe I'm using the wrong word, blocked, but apprehension... Would you like to think that some of your best work is still ahead of you?

11:43.465 --> 11:47.250
Well, I think this book is among my best books.

11:47.270 --> 11:48.571
I love this book, by the way.

11:48.591 --> 11:50.954
My wife told me this morning when we were discussing it.

11:50.974 --> 11:53.778
She said, I get it now.

11:55.199 --> 11:57.262
But again, this is a memoir.

11:57.322 --> 11:59.525
I mean best work in terms of dramatic work.

12:01.907 --> 12:02.428
Who knows?

12:03.670 --> 12:05.011
You're working on some things.

12:05.031 --> 12:06.493
You're always writing a poem.

12:06.553 --> 12:08.135
I've just written a film.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.101
It was called Almost Everybody Runs.

12:14.768 --> 12:20.053
And we'll keep going to production this spring.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.895
And I'm working on a play now.

12:23.797 --> 12:25.058
You work every day I guess?

12:25.119 --> 12:25.619
Yeah.

12:26.860 --> 12:29.443
Seven days a week usually.

12:29.463 --> 12:31.265
There's no shortage of ideas?

12:32.766 --> 12:33.147
Not yet.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.832
You've been described as an autobiographical playwright.

12:39.613 --> 12:40.354
Fair assessment?

12:44.148 --> 12:45.970
You mean I lived in 1692?

12:48.913 --> 12:50.274
You mean I was a long shaman?

12:50.614 --> 12:57.361
Well, uh... You mean I... Again we say, again we say, again... I lived in southern France.

12:57.481 --> 13:05.129
Again we say, however, again, however, we say that human nature is timeless, transcends... These are meaningless statements.

13:05.149 --> 13:05.409
Right.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.430
What I'm saying.

13:08.252 --> 13:13.497
I have written more plays about more scenes of different people maybe than most

13:15.485 --> 13:19.511
This son of Vichy is about the Jews of Southern France.

13:19.671 --> 13:20.572
I love the words.

13:20.692 --> 13:22.054
I can't remember.

13:22.415 --> 13:27.102
This is about Italian martial.

13:27.362 --> 13:30.627
The crucible is about Germans in 1692.

13:32.249 --> 13:34.472
All my sons are about a manufacturer.

13:34.655 --> 13:37.458
But the Crucible spoke for a time, though, didn't it?

13:37.478 --> 13:40.322
I mean, it spoke for all time.

13:40.342 --> 13:44.727
I mean, not only for 1692, it also spoke for 1852, I think.

13:44.827 --> 13:49.713
What is the opposite of it?

13:51.755 --> 13:53.577
I tell you, we haven't even been in here.

13:55.479 --> 14:00.946
We're trying to do an interview, and I think the vacuum might... I won't be able to get anything on the tape record.

14:01.887 --> 14:03.649
I'm sorry.

14:04.068 --> 14:06.812
We have hardly walked into it.

14:06.832 --> 14:13.121
Yeah, those are, again, those are tags that lazy journalists use.

14:13.201 --> 14:14.162
Forgive me.

14:14.182 --> 14:15.665
Well, that's not my assessment.

14:15.685 --> 14:17.707
I read it in the New York Times.

14:17.727 --> 14:20.732
Yeah, well, they're as lazy as anybody else.

14:20.892 --> 14:21.853
No, it isn't true.

14:22.274 --> 14:24.878
It's no more true than about anybody else.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.560
Well, does it offend you when you see that?

14:26.921 --> 14:28.363
No, it just seems silly.

14:28.523 --> 14:32.809
It's a pointless statement to make, because anybody who writes any number of works...

14:32.924 --> 14:35.727
of course, using his experience.

14:35.947 --> 14:41.113
You mentioned in time bands that you had any number of models, for instance, for Willie.

14:41.454 --> 14:46.279
So many would like to say that the uncle was the model.

14:46.419 --> 14:51.165
You say, I don't think the man spoke more than 200 words in his life.

14:51.525 --> 14:57.131
I tell you, the problem is, you see, that most people can't imagine creating anything.

14:58.653 --> 15:01.176
So they think that a writer is a reporter.

15:03.265 --> 15:04.106
That's the problem.

15:05.207 --> 15:17.179
And so they go looking for the model as though the work were nothing but some kind of a report that he made of an event, which is perfectly okay.

15:17.479 --> 15:22.664
I mean, there have been great books written about actual events.

15:22.865 --> 15:28.350
Dostoevsky used to write out of newspaper clippings.

15:28.370 --> 15:29.892
There's nothing wrong with it.

15:30.312 --> 15:33.255
It's just that it doesn't happen to be.

15:33.421 --> 15:47.159
I'm fascinated, though, by the father-son relationship that you have written about.

15:47.179 --> 15:53.787
Perhaps you could tell me about your particular fascination for that case.

15:53.807 --> 16:01.437
Well, again, I am pretty much sticking to the writing, by the way, because the other personal stuff is fascinating, but that's in the book.

16:01.636 --> 16:15.414
Well, the Father and Son thing, again, is central to my work, but it also doesn't exist in about half of the place.

16:17.337 --> 16:20.481
I said, well, I didn't say all, but I said it is a theme.

16:20.501 --> 16:28.892
Well, it's not in the crucible, it's not in looking for the bridge, it's not in the conservatory, it's not in numerous places.

16:29.311 --> 16:36.017
It happens to be the main theme in The Death of the Seldom, but when I were all right about it.

16:36.037 --> 16:40.442
And that goes to play, but thereafter I left it behind.

16:41.102 --> 16:47.648
That's about forty years ago.

16:47.728 --> 16:56.837
There's a beautifully written line which is, I have to say my favorite section of the book is that

16:57.408 --> 17:13.728
I love them all, but I particularly like that section where you're describing the creation of Death of the Civil, the writing of it, the staging of it, the reception of it, how it changed you as a personality, or the perception of you as a personality.

17:13.748 --> 17:19.575
You say that how I was and how I was perceived to be were two different things.

17:19.755 --> 17:22.299
Perhaps you could explain a little bit of that to me.

17:22.419 --> 17:24.541
How did you differ from the perception?

17:24.561 --> 17:25.963
Well, it's just like any other thing.

17:27.142 --> 17:54.229
I'd had a lot of success before with a play that in fact opened here, one of my sons, and that too had changed my life in the sense that I was then able to call upon the theater that produced my stuff, whereas before I couldn't.

17:54.766 --> 17:56.768
So that makes a big difference.

17:56.788 --> 18:11.244
You know, you come to a point where you have a certain amount of clout, and it means you're free to try new things.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.246
That's what happened out of All My Sons.

18:13.266 --> 18:17.971
I could not have written death myself had I not had a successful All My Sons.

18:17.991 --> 18:22.596
You also mentioned that All My Sons was the last shot, by the way, I guess.

18:22.913 --> 18:24.014
Right.

18:24.074 --> 18:34.744
Well, I'd written about ten plays by that time, and I'd had no great success with any of them.

18:34.764 --> 18:40.389
So, I wouldn't want to sit around waiting the rest of my life.

18:40.409 --> 18:44.413
I could write prose, and I would go become a prose writer.

18:45.574 --> 18:50.659
And, indeed, after Nathaniel, another play early, I'd write a novel called

18:52.900 --> 18:56.966
But I have a copy of it here.

18:56.986 --> 19:02.434
Well, that came out of the theater of the play, actually.

19:02.454 --> 19:05.518
So I don't know.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.580
It just makes you freer.

19:08.583 --> 19:13.410
It gives you the right to experiment, which the salesman was.

19:15.433 --> 19:22.603
And after the salesman, I could then turn to another poem.

19:23.680 --> 19:31.512
In short, it means freedom, if you use it right.

19:31.532 --> 19:34.837
You create characters, memorable characters.

19:34.857 --> 19:38.002
So many of today's playwrights don't.

19:39.224 --> 19:41.367
Is there an explanation for that?

19:42.228 --> 19:45.874
I don't know.

19:50.630 --> 19:55.135
of some autonomous human being is strange to a lot of people.

19:57.598 --> 20:12.896
I often wonder whether the theater is reflecting a feeling in the public that characters don't matter anymore.

20:14.878 --> 20:18.342
That we're so predetermined as to what we're going to do.

20:19.469 --> 20:27.259
that psychology is boring and boring, and it really doesn't matter what you think or what you feel.

20:27.779 --> 20:38.192
What matters is what the social circumstance is, what your job is, what you have to do, and what you're forbidden to do by your job.

20:38.212 --> 20:47.704
So, what we're getting is a reflection back from the stage and from the movies of what we really feel.

20:49.220 --> 20:55.749
That would be pretty awful, but I often wonder whether that's the case.

20:55.770 --> 21:01.718
They're just describing men as he really thinks he is.

21:04.182 --> 21:06.425
Are you inside the theater today or outside of it?

21:06.445 --> 21:08.308
Do you feel an outsider?

21:08.328 --> 21:11.973
No, the truth is I've never felt that I was the inside of it.

21:11.993 --> 21:17.421
I've always been on the outside, and I don't regret that.

21:19.780 --> 21:28.313
I mean, most of the plays I've written have been rejected when they're first performed.

21:28.593 --> 21:29.074
Rejected?

21:29.094 --> 21:31.357
You'd be rejected by some critics.

21:31.397 --> 21:33.100
By critics, yeah.

21:33.120 --> 21:37.126
There's another question that I'd like to get to before you get into that.

21:37.847 --> 21:48.623
Actually, All My Sons would have closed shortly after it opened in New York, except for one critic, Brooks Atkinson on New York.

21:48.957 --> 21:54.125
And had he not put up a fight for it, I don't think it would have run a month.

21:54.445 --> 21:57.590
But a fight meaning go buy the ticket or it's not close.

21:57.610 --> 22:02.197
Well, he wrote about four essays about it.

22:02.217 --> 22:05.322
Not every Sunday, but like four.

22:05.402 --> 22:06.984
He championed it, in other words.

22:07.004 --> 22:07.244
Right.

22:07.645 --> 22:12.653
And he beat down the opposition to it.

22:12.673 --> 22:16.298
But without that, and without his belief in me,

22:18.252 --> 22:24.461
I doubt that I would have had any success.

22:24.481 --> 22:26.424
Can you explain this?

22:26.444 --> 22:34.695
Why do you tend to baffle some critics, and yet you speak to audiences?

22:34.836 --> 22:35.316
I don't know.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.923
That's for them to say.

22:40.283 --> 22:47.854
There is a tradition of criticism, I guess, in this country, which is very much unlike what you would find, say, in Great Britain.

22:48.593 --> 22:51.135
That's true.

22:51.155 --> 22:51.256
Yeah.

22:51.276 --> 22:52.737
They seem more knowledgeable.

22:52.837 --> 23:14.818
I tell you what, our criticism on the whole, our tradition is to look at theater as a purely private, as a place for private relationships.

23:14.838 --> 23:17.841
And where society enters in, it becomes

23:18.732 --> 23:28.304
or man as a social animal, which manifestly is and has always been.

23:29.486 --> 23:34.912
There's something anaesthetic in that to me.

23:34.932 --> 23:36.855
Don't ask me why, but it is.

23:36.955 --> 23:47.288
It's not only in America, but for a long time, until the mid-50s in England, except for someone like George Bernard Shaw, who was

23:47.825 --> 23:58.816
I have the other one.

24:04.661 --> 24:13.630
And that was their tradition until the mid-'50s, when they

24:14.099 --> 24:27.240
So it still exists.

24:27.361 --> 24:33.190
It's still a factor with us.

24:33.230 --> 24:39.200
This might sound like a foolish question, but it's certainly baffled a lot of people.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.203
We're changing gears now entirely.

24:41.538 --> 24:47.587
Shakespeare never published his plays, never thought enough about them to publish them.

24:47.607 --> 24:57.360
This says something about a playwright creating for performance only, talking about one of the great geniuses.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.103
I'd just throw that out as a statement.

25:00.585 --> 25:03.289
Of course, if the play is not a performance.

25:03.309 --> 25:05.652
The two hours traffic of our stage, I mean, is this it?

25:06.253 --> 25:09.958
This is an ephemeral experience, I guess is what I'm asking about here.

25:10.715 --> 25:12.477
Well, it is basically that.

25:13.058 --> 25:17.564
It's got to be that, or it's nothing.

25:18.305 --> 25:24.112
It's literary pretensions are definitely secondary.

25:24.132 --> 25:29.740
It's got to work as a play before it can be called a play, and before it will have any life.

25:32.483 --> 25:39.152
It's good stuff, I just want to make sure I'm getting it.

25:40.465 --> 25:51.095
But you as a playwright can perhaps feel a bit of what Shakespeare might have felt, that the publication of these things was perhaps irrelevant.

25:52.576 --> 26:09.612
In one sense, the only point to it is that people who like to read plays, and there are not many, can have access to them, and other actors who want them can have them.

26:13.169 --> 26:16.312
But one place is now circulated fairly well.

26:16.332 --> 26:22.438
Much more than they did when I started out.

26:22.859 --> 26:30.787
All the sales that have been published about many millions of copies by this time.

26:30.807 --> 26:39.916
And the Crucible has had enormous sales as a published one.

26:39.936 --> 26:42.619
I'm just going to switch this tape.

26:43.662 --> 26:44.696
going out of sight.
