00:04.030 --> 00:10.999
Talking to Dawn Dewey, who is the head of Special Collections and Archives at Wright State University.

00:11.019 --> 00:12.742
And it's, what's the date today?

00:12.782 --> 00:13.883
The 21st.

00:14.063 --> 00:15.025
21st.

00:15.185 --> 00:15.405
July.

00:15.425 --> 00:15.666
July.

00:15.846 --> 00:16.266
2004.

00:16.286 --> 00:16.987
2004.

00:17.188 --> 00:19.431
So it's just far away.

00:19.491 --> 00:20.612
Well, we're glad to have you here.

00:20.632 --> 00:21.473
It's a delight.

00:22.475 --> 00:24.978
This Wright Brothers collection that we have is so remarkable.

00:25.058 --> 00:31.247
And the thing that I like about it is it tells us so much more than just airplane construction and the technical aspects.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.109
It's social and cultural history as well.

00:33.747 --> 00:39.133
The Wright Brothers' collection is a part of many, many aviation collections that we have here.

00:40.794 --> 00:50.485
Just briefly to give you an overview of the whole place, not only do we collect and provide access to things on aviation history, but we do the local and regional history of this area.

00:51.205 --> 01:01.476
We have a lot of collections on politics, labor, church history, family history, the arts, civic organizations, just about any topic you can think of, military history.

01:01.793 --> 01:05.076
We have collections that relate to that, as well as some local authors.

01:05.276 --> 01:08.839
We've got Suzanne Clauser's papers here, A Girl Named Sooner.

01:10.481 --> 01:12.002
It's one of her most famous works.

01:12.143 --> 01:21.351
And then there are some other local people who are, I guess we could classify them as local inventors who are self-made sorts of people with not that much education.

01:21.391 --> 01:23.073
Of course, Wilbur and Orville being there.

01:23.093 --> 01:24.374
Well, that's what's very attractive.

01:24.494 --> 01:24.794
Right.

01:25.655 --> 01:26.736
Right.

01:26.936 --> 01:30.079
I can't get away from that word.

01:30.278 --> 01:33.181
We're also the archives for the university, so we keep track of that.

01:34.363 --> 01:39.589
The Wright Brothers collection, we have a public guide to that collection, and that's this particular volume here.

01:39.629 --> 01:42.412
And this is also available online at our website.

01:42.452 --> 01:50.342
So after you leave here today, if you want to look at the collection overall, if you missed something today or you want to see something, you can look at that.

01:50.882 --> 01:57.450
What I printed out here for you was a list of what is in their technical library.

01:57.953 --> 02:00.616
as well as what is in their personal library.

02:00.996 --> 02:07.562
These are the books that came in to our collection about 30 or 40 years ago when the collection first came here in the late 70s.

02:08.523 --> 02:12.967
The technical library includes a lot of books on aviation, a lot of aviation journals.

02:14.068 --> 02:18.532
Some of the books are annotated by, we believe, Wilbur, and I'll show you those books today.

02:18.572 --> 02:26.560
We've got them in an exhibit case over here, but things like Lilienthal's Bird Flight, Octave Chanute's Progress and Flying Machines,

02:27.012 --> 02:36.301
some of Langley's works, books that were published at the time on aviation, which they were reading to find out what else had been done.

02:36.321 --> 02:44.009
And some of these books were sent to them by other scholars, researchers, scientists, and others I'm sure they just went out and got for their own library.

02:44.429 --> 02:52.257
The two cases that are here are full of books from their library, a lot of aviation journals, too, from the turn of the century.

02:52.557 --> 02:55.500
How large was their library, do you think, approximately?

02:56.037 --> 03:06.393
volumes, including their technical library that you'll see this afternoon that are still in Orville's library there.

03:06.914 --> 03:08.517
And so I'm not sure how many are there.

03:08.757 --> 03:11.361
So, you know, we're talking more than what we just have here.

03:12.162 --> 03:14.446
And again, I missed it because I pushed a button there.

03:14.506 --> 03:14.947
That's okay.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.129
What was the number?

03:16.149 --> 03:18.332
I'm thinking, I'm guesstimating.

03:18.515 --> 03:20.917
What we have here is probably three to four hundred volumes.

03:21.057 --> 03:21.718
Three to four hundred.

03:21.738 --> 03:25.161
But I'm sure there are more in Orville's Library out at Hawthorne Hill.

03:25.181 --> 03:26.142
So were these guys readers?

03:26.803 --> 03:27.644
Oh, yes.

03:27.664 --> 03:28.464
Gracious readers.

03:28.825 --> 03:29.405
Really?

03:29.425 --> 03:30.086
Yeah.

03:30.106 --> 03:32.228
Eclectic, or were they focused?

03:32.248 --> 03:34.290
Well, as far as aviation, they were very focused.

03:34.310 --> 03:46.902
And then I think in later years, especially after Wilbur passed away in 1912, Orville's Library starts to include a lot of things that appealed to him with respect, not to aviation, but to

03:47.303 --> 03:59.197
birds of trees and popular fiction at the time, books that Catherine, his sister, would have either received as gifts or amassed in her—she was a teacher.

03:59.698 --> 04:03.642
She went to Oberlin College, so there are a few of her textbooks in the library.

04:05.304 --> 04:08.768
She was very well-educated and intelligent, well-written.

04:08.788 --> 04:11.291
Do you think she helped in an intellectual sort of way?

04:11.311 --> 04:12.653
Do you think she contributed?

04:12.869 --> 04:19.983
I know the perception of her as kind of the manager, the one who's taking care of them.

04:20.364 --> 04:34.371
I think she was very capable of holding intelligent conversations with them and understanding maybe not all the specific technical aspects of the airplane, but I think she was probably a good person that they could bounce ideas off of.

04:34.874 --> 04:35.895
just to get a reaction.

04:35.995 --> 04:39.199
Maybe not technical things, but... It's funny.

04:39.219 --> 04:47.128
I was at a second-hand bookstore in Cape Cod a couple of weeks ago, and they had this book, and I said about buying it, because they wanted $1,500.

04:47.148 --> 04:54.095
There was a person, and I said, you do a printout for me, and apparently this is a book that... This is the one we have here that belonged to the rights, yes.

04:54.155 --> 04:58.841
And I should just say it for the sake of my tape recorder what it is, and it was significant to them, right?

04:58.861 --> 04:59.902
Very significant.

04:59.922 --> 05:03.666
This is Octave Chanute's Progress in Flying Machines, and he was one of the...

05:04.169 --> 05:08.719
probably the most knowledgeable individuals at the time on aviation and gliding.

05:09.060 --> 05:15.133
And so they respected him and studied his work quite extensively and became friends with him.

05:16.416 --> 05:23.612
And he encouraged them, wanted to hear what ideas they had, argued with them sometimes about whether they were right or he was right.

05:24.065 --> 05:29.069
But this is one of the... So you think this was a case where they read his book and then they contacted him?

05:29.089 --> 05:33.233
They established a relationship with him?

05:33.573 --> 05:34.534
A communication with him?

05:34.694 --> 05:35.275
Yeah.

05:35.315 --> 05:41.220
They were aware of Chanute and knew that he had been doing some work in this field and they had studied his work.

05:41.920 --> 05:47.185
And I'd have to go and check the records to see if he contacted them first or they him.

05:47.325 --> 05:49.547
I think Wilbur wrote to him, in fact.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.249
On the strength of having read his book.

05:51.449 --> 05:52.890
So that's kind of something that...

05:53.056 --> 06:02.187
I'd like to follow up on it, and if we can't get to it today, maybe if you don't mind, we could, you know... I'm sure we can verify that today.

06:02.847 --> 06:07.673
This particular set here... And that's the Papers of Wilbur and Orville Life, published by McGraw-Hill.

06:07.793 --> 06:08.033
Yes.

06:08.894 --> 06:10.236
You familiar with that set already?

06:10.256 --> 06:10.977
No, I'm just saying it.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.039
Okay, I'm sorry.

06:13.480 --> 06:22.590
This particular two-volume set, these are letters and diary entries that are contained in the collection, their personal collection,

06:22.908 --> 06:24.851
that is housed at the Library of Congress.

06:26.293 --> 06:32.844
The letter that Wilbur wrote to Chanute, I'm sure, is in that first volume, and so we'll pull that out today, and you can read that.

06:34.226 --> 06:40.596
But that was the first published work that helped to disseminate their letters and diary entries.

06:41.217 --> 06:46.021
So that's definitely something you'd probably want to take a look at because it's their words and writing.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.923
When was that approximately published?

06:47.943 --> 06:49.424
This is about the third edition.

06:49.845 --> 06:52.307
Oh, they could have that at Clark University.

06:52.327 --> 06:53.408
Oh, yeah.

06:53.969 --> 06:57.191
Yeah, this is 2001.

06:57.412 --> 06:59.934
It was first published back in the 70s.

07:00.194 --> 07:05.159
Well, no, probably the 50s because the collection went to the Library of Congress shortly after Orville died in 48.

07:05.179 --> 07:10.043
Yeah, I'm sure the front will tell you.

07:10.765 --> 07:12.567
Fifty-three.

07:12.607 --> 07:14.129
Fifty-three, yeah.

07:14.149 --> 07:16.312
Right.

07:16.332 --> 07:17.293
So, yeah.

07:17.313 --> 07:21.298
They pursued other people at the time who were studying aviation.

07:21.318 --> 07:23.981
They also studied Lilienthal, the German glider pilot.

07:24.882 --> 07:26.384
They were aware of what he was doing.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.988
They followed his experiments in the newspapers, articles.

07:32.051 --> 07:33.853
They were

07:34.103 --> 07:45.174
Wilbur especially was upset when Lilienthal was killed in a gliding accident, and I think it made him want to study even more, to figure out what went wrong, because he didn't want to make the same mistake.

07:45.254 --> 07:52.521
Now, were these people publishing books and journals, and you think that maybe there were the rights of reading them, and this is how they were getting... I'm sure they were.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.564
...started to stay focused on this particular life.

07:54.584 --> 07:55.565
That's okay.

07:55.605 --> 07:56.626
That's all right.

07:57.206 --> 07:59.048
I think they definitely were.

07:59.365 --> 08:01.568
Wilbur, especially, was very interested.

08:01.588 --> 08:02.749
I mean, he was a reader.

08:02.809 --> 08:08.116
He was very smart, even though they didn't have much formal education.

08:08.457 --> 08:10.660
And what was the extent of their formal education?

08:10.680 --> 08:18.069
Wilbur completed high school, but for a long time, the stories were that neither of them had completed a high school education.

08:18.570 --> 08:27.381
But Wilbur, in fact, completed high school in Richmond, Indiana, but moved before the commencement exercises and didn't collect his diploma.

08:27.496 --> 08:29.699
So no diploma existed for him.

08:31.042 --> 08:34.747
They gave him his diploma posthumously about ten years ago.

08:35.909 --> 08:38.614
Richmond High School now has Wilbur Wright as a graduate.

08:40.096 --> 08:44.663
Wilbur was, in fact, planning on going to college, to Harvard.

08:45.324 --> 08:51.314
I think he'd even done the application, but he had a hockey accident.

08:51.474 --> 08:54.178
He was playing a game of shinny or ice hockey.

08:54.732 --> 08:58.897
at the local VA, our veterans home, soldiers and sailors home here in Dayton.

08:58.917 --> 09:01.300
It was a place people went for recreational purposes.

09:01.901 --> 09:08.429
And he got smashed in the mouth with a hockey stick, lost a lot of teeth, or damage to his teeth.

09:08.449 --> 09:12.494
We're not sure how extensive it was, but we know he had to go to the dentist and get a lot of work done.

09:13.075 --> 09:14.236
And it really shook him up.

09:14.276 --> 09:19.002
And the family stories are that he just kind of withdrew into himself.

09:19.538 --> 09:22.742
At the time, his mother was very sick with tuberculosis and dying.

09:22.802 --> 09:24.744
And so he decided he wouldn't go to college.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.766
He stayed home, took care of his mother.

09:27.767 --> 09:28.808
She eventually died.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.371
And he never did pursue.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.653
Was he admitted to Harvard?

09:32.673 --> 09:32.913
Do you know?

09:33.033 --> 09:33.594
I don't know.

09:33.634 --> 09:40.702
It'd be interesting to look at the school records to see if he actually sent in that application or whether this is all just hearsay.

09:41.903 --> 09:44.786
But he did have plans to go on to college.

09:44.826 --> 09:48.010
Harvard is the one that we've clearly had the...

09:48.985 --> 09:54.112
the intellect commensurate with the Harvard education.

09:54.132 --> 09:58.237
At what point do you think he becomes impassioned with flight?

09:58.317 --> 10:10.714
I mean, is there something in particular that really gets him... That question's been asked so many times, and the general opinion is that after his mother died, he was searching.

10:10.754 --> 10:12.516
He was a young man, you know, right around 20.

10:12.556 --> 10:14.599
He was searching, what am I going to do with my life?

10:14.719 --> 10:15.820
I'm not going to go to college.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.963
He was a very quiet, reserved sort of person.

10:18.803 --> 10:31.640
Some say he was just searching for something that would spark his interest, that would get him going, and he got interested in flight just through books he'd read or newspaper clippings he was hearing about Lilienthal.

10:33.722 --> 10:43.495
So I don't think there's any one thing, although people like to say that the thing that sparked their interest initially was a little toy helicopter that their father gave them when they were little boys.

10:44.032 --> 10:47.256
Every little boy likes spikes.

10:47.276 --> 10:48.817
A dollar across the baton.

10:48.857 --> 10:49.898
Yeah.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.080
Like helicopters.

10:55.104 --> 11:01.551
They keep books from their youth or mainly things that... We have school books.

11:01.671 --> 11:04.615
You know, like the McGuffey Readers and some of the early things.

11:04.855 --> 11:05.996
They kept them.

11:06.016 --> 11:10.001
We have Orville's Botany Sketchbook in the collection.

11:10.021 --> 11:10.922
I'll show you that today.

11:11.883 --> 11:13.144
We don't have much...

11:13.512 --> 11:22.362
in the way of Wilbur's, other than his report cards, we have their report cards from Wilbur and Orville and Catherine, so you can see what subjects they studied and what grades they got.

11:23.223 --> 11:25.966
We have an essay that Catherine wrote for the school newspaper.

11:27.527 --> 11:33.354
There's not much on Wilbur, a little bit more on Orville and more on Catherine as far as school things that are still in the collection.

11:34.215 --> 11:41.022
And there are some writings by their father, Milton, who in his letters he will describe his kids.

11:41.356 --> 11:43.838
what they look like, or what their personalities are like.

11:46.621 --> 11:54.708
But as far as Wilbur, it's hard to pin down any one striking moment that suddenly he said, I'm going to build the first powered airplane.

11:54.768 --> 12:00.152
There's no epiphanous moment that we can certainly have any document that's been recorded.

12:00.413 --> 12:06.678
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he was reading some book, you know, and said, boy, this is it.

12:07.439 --> 12:08.200
The light flashes.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.861
But there's no really one great

12:10.162 --> 12:18.669
Is there any great epiphanous moment where they say, aha, the eureka moment, I guess, when they've got it, when they've figured it out?

12:18.850 --> 12:28.078
When they solve the problem of flight, they say that Wilbur was messing with a bicycle inner tube box in the bicycle shop one day.

12:28.678 --> 12:33.462
And at the time, they had already been experimenting with gliders while they were running their bicycle shop, kites and gliders.

12:34.083 --> 12:38.987
And the story is that Wilbur was twisting this box while he was talking to a customer.

12:39.423 --> 12:46.811
and suddenly said, oh, this looks like a biplane, or this looks like a kite, and these look like wings, and why couldn't we make the wings of the glider do this?

12:46.951 --> 12:50.855
And that's where this whole idea of wing warping supposedly came from.

12:50.915 --> 12:58.343
So that's been, you know, passed down through over time, that that was kind of the moment where... But that was inspiration.

12:58.604 --> 13:00.346
That was inspiration, yeah.

13:00.386 --> 13:02.508
Picked up from... Right.

13:02.708 --> 13:03.249
Somebody.

13:03.269 --> 13:04.250
Yeah.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.915
There was always that human intellect that... Mm-hmm.

13:08.935 --> 13:09.075
Mm-hmm.

13:09.899 --> 13:13.665
Orville, on the other hand, didn't like school very much.

13:14.806 --> 13:18.151
The stories are that he got into trouble a lot, that he couldn't concentrate.

13:18.792 --> 13:22.097
He was either too smart and they weren't giving him enough stimulation.

13:23.619 --> 13:28.186
Stories are that he skipped school when his mother first sent him off to first grade or second grade.

13:28.587 --> 13:33.113
He'd go out and meet his buddy and it looked like they'd gone to school, but they didn't.

13:33.133 --> 13:36.919
They went back to the other buddy's house and played all day.

13:37.135 --> 13:42.621
And I guess after a couple of weeks she found out about this and was, of course, quite upset with him.

13:42.721 --> 13:48.828
And I think she got him a tutor or homeschooled him for a while, but she eventually packed him off back to school and he stayed.

13:49.368 --> 13:50.830
But he did drop out in high school.

13:50.850 --> 13:51.651
He did not finish.

13:52.011 --> 14:00.861
He went to, I think, about sophomore, junior year of high school and then said, this is not for me, and left.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.965
And he was more interested in pursuing starting his own business or

14:05.587 --> 14:10.874
just pursuing other things like printing and then the bicycle shop and so forth.

14:11.114 --> 14:15.259
So formal education, not much at all.

14:15.279 --> 14:23.610
I think they had what it took upstairs to that inquisitiveness and just voracious readers.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.934
They had parents who encouraged them to study and to pursue.

14:26.974 --> 14:29.097
And this is documentable.

14:29.498 --> 14:34.283
That's something I'd kind of like to get a little detail on.

14:34.463 --> 14:35.004
Okay.

14:35.144 --> 14:41.831
One thing I think that would help, there's a book that was published by their niece.

14:44.333 --> 14:47.677
This one's called Wright Reminiscences, and it was published in 1978.

14:47.877 --> 14:55.045
Ivanette Wright Miller is the compiler, and she was the Wright brothers' niece.

14:55.065 --> 14:57.447
She was the daughter of one of their older brothers.

14:58.085 --> 15:05.555
And for years, these stories about the Wright Brothers' childhood and what it was like to be around them as adults were passed around through the family and from friends.

15:06.176 --> 15:10.762
And someone encouraged Ivanette to put those stories together before they were lost.

15:11.984 --> 15:22.798
And so this particular volume is full of reminiscences by family members or by other people who knew them, pilots, businessmen, people they worked with.

15:24.501 --> 15:26.944
So you can get a sense of their...

15:28.055 --> 15:34.025
childhood, as well as, you know, what they were like as adults to be around from that particular book.

15:34.385 --> 15:37.310
Is this actually published or is this for the typescript?

15:37.330 --> 15:43.500
It's published by the Air Force Museum, the Friends group, and I think you can still purchase copies over there.

15:44.101 --> 15:46.204
I'm not sure if I have any extras around here.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.768
That tells me how I can get them.

15:48.788 --> 15:51.613
Yeah, but the Air Force Museum bookstore, I'm sure you could get a copy.

15:53.015 --> 15:54.537
I think they're still printing it.

15:54.958 --> 15:55.058
Good.

15:56.000 --> 16:03.829
But that would be a good one for, you know, just personality to learn a bit more about what they were like.

16:04.609 --> 16:05.651
Good.

16:05.671 --> 16:05.871
Excellent.

16:05.891 --> 16:06.492
That's a good one.

16:07.252 --> 16:09.054
I should be able to find that.

16:09.215 --> 16:10.556
Yeah, I'll see if we have an extra.

16:10.616 --> 16:12.198
We get a lot of book donations around here.

16:12.218 --> 16:15.702
If you have one, that would save me time.

16:15.722 --> 16:21.128
And this biography, I know, is supposed to be the Bishop's Boys.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.930
I think it's supposed to be very, very good.

16:22.950 --> 16:23.751
I think I have.

16:23.831 --> 16:25.112
I'm pretty sure I have this one.

16:25.565 --> 16:34.698
That one has been reprinted in the last year or so in softbound paperback as well.

16:34.838 --> 16:44.873
Tom Crouch, the author of that one, senior curator at the Air and Space Museum, he's really the foremost expert on the Wright Brothers.

16:47.677 --> 16:49.660
He would be a very good person to talk to.

16:50.060 --> 16:50.862
He's in Washington?

16:50.882 --> 16:51.863
He's in D.C.

16:51.883 --> 16:54.627
He is a native of this area in Dayton.

16:55.163 --> 17:01.832
He travels back here quite often, but he is at the National Air and Space Museum, and I can give you his contact information, his email and his phone number.

17:01.852 --> 17:02.152
Terrific.

17:02.633 --> 17:05.997
But he'd be a great one to talk to because he's researched them extensively.

17:06.017 --> 17:09.401
I think he's really considered the expert.

17:11.684 --> 17:11.965
Good.

17:12.105 --> 17:24.681
In the last year or so, because of the centennial, there have been many biographies pop up, and the next one probably that I'd recommend is Ian Macersey's, the big thick one there on the bottom.

17:25.522 --> 17:36.252
He did extensive research and I think filled in some holes perhaps that Tom had not, you know, the materials weren't available at the time, but Macrisy was able to track them down.

17:38.354 --> 17:39.876
And I've not read all of that one yet.

17:39.916 --> 17:44.580
I'm still working my way through it, but he, it's a good biography.

17:48.404 --> 17:52.268
There's a couple of other things as far as published materials.

17:52.328 --> 17:54.550
There's an early, this one,

17:55.323 --> 18:05.713
This one was done in 1955 by an author named Lois Mills, and it's called Three Together, and it's a story about Wilbur Orville and Kaplan as children.

18:06.534 --> 18:12.820
And I think it's based more on stories, family stories, and maybe rumors or legend that's been passed down.

18:13.281 --> 18:15.543
And this is kind of hard to get a hold of.

18:15.683 --> 18:19.307
We've got a Xerox copy of it that you can take with you if you'd like.

18:20.888 --> 18:24.452
But that might be something to read about their early childhood.

18:25.327 --> 18:26.128
Oh, yes.

18:26.208 --> 18:29.331
Feel free.

18:29.351 --> 18:29.651
Snape?

18:29.911 --> 18:30.192
Yes.

18:30.292 --> 18:32.154
Yeah, put them over on the fragile side.

18:32.834 --> 18:33.235
All right.

18:33.255 --> 18:34.836
Wonderful one.

18:34.856 --> 18:34.956
Yeah.

18:35.237 --> 18:36.398
It's a pictorial cloth.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.401
Been well read, hasn't it?

18:39.421 --> 18:41.663
Mm-hmm.

18:41.683 --> 18:41.823
Mm-hmm.

18:41.843 --> 18:42.584
Three together.

18:45.927 --> 18:47.709
See, it's a discard.

18:48.770 --> 18:48.910
Mm-hmm.

18:48.930 --> 18:49.070
Mm-hmm.

18:49.210 --> 18:50.691
Which I write about in my last book here.

18:51.893 --> 18:54.195
I'm in a book here, an important book.

18:54.215 --> 18:54.355
Mm-hmm.

18:55.600 --> 19:04.511
This particular author interviewed people who knew the rights to try to write an accurate account of their childhood.

19:09.937 --> 19:13.702
I think I'll get the answer with Crouch.

19:14.082 --> 19:16.946
Yeah, he would be a very good one to talk, too.

19:22.793 --> 19:24.375
This is another...

19:26.549 --> 19:31.317
In 2000, this one was published.

19:31.357 --> 19:33.841
These are the published writings of Wilbur and Orville.

19:34.142 --> 19:38.729
Through this volume, you could read what they wrote, what they were thinking.

19:39.471 --> 19:42.856
The book includes interviews that they did with newspaper reporters.

19:42.977 --> 19:48.486
It includes articles that they wrote and have published in either aviation journals or newspapers or magazines.

19:49.528 --> 19:52.152
It's divided into sections, depending on

19:52.672 --> 20:17.430
on their life. Did they write a book documenting their? The only thing that was written would have been this and this is a reprint of something that Orville wrote that was entitled How We Invented the Airplane, so it's Orville's account of how they invented the airplane. Um yeah and I think this is pretty widely available.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.148
Yeah.

20:19.609 --> 20:24.515
In fact, you'd probably go to the Air Force Museum bookstore and buy all of these in one side.

20:24.595 --> 20:26.097
Are they around?

20:26.397 --> 20:27.198
Five minutes from here.

20:27.499 --> 20:28.460
Very close.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.282
Is there something I could do at some point?

20:30.402 --> 20:30.923
Sneak out?

20:31.444 --> 20:37.932
What you may want to do, depending on how much after this morning, depending on how much more you want to do here.

20:38.212 --> 20:40.975
We could leave early on the way to lunch.

20:41.015 --> 20:42.998
Or coming back in the afternoon.

20:43.018 --> 20:43.659
Yeah, this afternoon.

20:43.679 --> 20:44.860
Yeah, we'll stop in there.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.302
That would really be good.

20:46.322 --> 20:46.422
Yeah.

20:46.857 --> 20:48.659
But I would recommend that one.

20:49.340 --> 20:52.344
Now, Orville wrote that one, How We Invented the Airplane.

20:52.364 --> 20:56.209
Of course, Wilbur died in 1912, so this was written a little bit later.

20:56.810 --> 21:09.085
There is an article in Century Magazine that was published in 1906, I think, where Wilbur and Orville collaborated and put together an article that tells people the story of how they invented the airplane.

21:10.415 --> 21:17.944
It's so interesting because are you familiar with the Printing and the Mind of Man exhibition in London, 1963?

21:18.384 --> 21:18.965
No, I'm not.

21:19.286 --> 21:26.374
And that's kind of framing this doesn't have to be.

21:26.754 --> 21:37.367
They documented their achievements through diary entries, through journals, through correspondence with other individuals, and through photographs, thousands of photographs.

21:37.600 --> 21:42.027
Well, there are thousands of photographs that document their entire career in aviation.

21:42.047 --> 21:42.788
Very interesting.

21:42.808 --> 21:50.400
But about—they took many, many photographs themselves at Kitty Hawk, and so they documented their gliders through those photographs.

21:51.141 --> 21:52.363
And I'll show you those today.

21:52.383 --> 21:53.505
I mean, this is a hundred years ago.

21:53.585 --> 21:57.992
The camera is really, at that point, a very rudimentary instrument.

21:58.092 --> 22:02.659
And yet they were doing visual documentation as opposed to— Exactly.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.363
Visual and in their diaries.

22:05.731 --> 22:08.994
The diaries weren't necessarily meant for dissemination, were they?

22:09.535 --> 22:15.861
They probably weren't necessarily thinking that they were going to get published in a— The word in print in the mind of man is print.

22:16.862 --> 22:21.666
It's where the Columbus letter announces the discovery of America.

22:22.887 --> 22:26.331
This whole continent is bracketed in print, if you think about it.

22:26.491 --> 22:32.937
The only great country anywhere where you can really say its beginnings are documented in print.

22:33.153 --> 22:38.358
They did it, but they focused on photography, as you say.

22:38.378 --> 22:39.379
Do you have the pictures here?

22:39.419 --> 22:41.301
They have many of the original prints.

22:41.381 --> 22:42.982
We've got some in the case right here.

22:43.723 --> 22:45.104
And so what do they use of?

22:45.124 --> 22:47.086
What kind of camera equipment do they use?

22:47.746 --> 22:49.308
I suppose I'll get this out of here.

22:49.348 --> 22:54.533
Yeah, there's a section right in the front of this particular book that tells you the type of camera they used and everything.

22:54.573 --> 22:58.016
I'm not as versed at photography, so I can't tell you that off the top of my head.

22:58.076 --> 23:02.400
But it's a box camera, like a 4x5 negative size glass plate.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.417
Sure, yeah.

23:03.677 --> 23:05.261
They took that to Kitty Hawk with them.

23:05.982 --> 23:10.190
The camera is at Carillon Historical Park here in Dayton, the camera they used.

23:10.912 --> 23:20.491
But can you imagine them hauling this camera on the train to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1901, 2, and 3, and out there on the sand with a tripod?

23:20.591 --> 23:22.335
Okay, you'd be very interested.

23:22.355 --> 23:24.439
Very interesting.

23:25.955 --> 23:29.019
But, you know, they took the photographs there on the beach.

23:29.039 --> 23:29.500
They chose photography.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.461
This is very interesting.

23:30.501 --> 23:33.184
Well, it was a hobby of theirs before they went to Kitty Hawk.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.731
But they chose, you know, they took the camera along and documented what they did.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.256
And they chose photography as the medium of documentation.

23:42.276 --> 23:43.317
Is that a fair statement?

23:43.337 --> 23:46.201
Probably that was the primary method.

23:46.521 --> 23:47.943
And then the diaries and the journals.

23:48.584 --> 23:50.967
And the journals and the notes.

23:51.087 --> 23:54.191
And did they fully annotate the pictures?

23:54.331 --> 23:55.793
Did they have notes and captions?

23:56.127 --> 23:57.169
Or are they just pictures?

23:57.249 --> 23:58.551
Is it like a puzzle?

23:58.571 --> 24:00.995
Do you have to figure out what place they are?

24:01.015 --> 24:02.938
Some of them are a puzzle, even today.

24:03.259 --> 24:03.579
Yeah.

24:03.599 --> 24:08.868
We have found that they were labeled by people after the fact, and they're mislabeled.

24:09.148 --> 24:09.789
But not by them?

24:09.910 --> 24:10.631
But not by them.

24:11.332 --> 24:12.915
Did they label any of them?

24:12.935 --> 24:16.320
Yeah, they did, some, but not every single photograph.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.482
The key ones, do you think?

24:17.843 --> 24:19.165
The key ones, yes.

24:19.185 --> 24:20.447
In fact, in the diaries,

24:20.866 --> 24:27.011
There was a list of photographs that were taken where they do annotate some of those very earliest ones from Kitty Hawk.

24:27.672 --> 24:31.155
The later ones are not quite as precisely listed.

24:31.796 --> 24:35.579
But they were almost like an archivist.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.760
They were keeping track.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.283
They were making notes and keeping track and documenting through the photographs.

24:40.803 --> 24:45.948
And because of that, we have these tremendous collections today that tell us the whole story.

24:47.990 --> 24:50.772
Yeah, there are still questions that we don't know the answers to, but...

24:51.190 --> 24:53.372
Oh, yeah.

24:53.392 --> 24:56.676
I mean, if we knew all the answers, right?

24:56.696 --> 24:57.938
We don't want to know all the answers.

24:57.998 --> 25:08.449
So, but can somebody who's an inventor, who's smart, more or less replicate what they did by following their papers and their materials that they left?

25:08.930 --> 25:11.413
Many groups have tried over the last couple of years.

25:12.214 --> 25:16.018
One particular person, maybe you want to talk to him at some point.

25:16.038 --> 25:19.201
His name is Ken Hyde, H-Y-D-E.

25:19.682 --> 25:20.623
He lives in Virginia.

25:20.722 --> 25:31.159
He heads up a company called Virginia Aviation, and they've spent the last, my goodness, five, ten years, I'm not sure how long, researching what the Wrights did.

25:31.179 --> 25:37.649
They have been here to our archives and poured over pictures, zoomed in on, focused in on particular parts of the pictures.

25:37.669 --> 25:38.530
Can you give me contact with me?

25:38.550 --> 25:40.193
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

25:40.894 --> 25:47.725
He would be able to tell you, you know, their journey of trying to discover how to replicate what the Wrights did.

25:47.907 --> 25:53.613
He and his group are the ones that built the airplane, the replica that they tried to fly at Kitty Hawk this year.

25:54.695 --> 25:55.836
Unsuccessfully.

25:55.856 --> 25:57.538
Unsuccessfully.

25:58.479 --> 25:59.099
That's crazy.

25:59.119 --> 25:59.580
Unsuccessfully, yeah.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.441
Well, that's the point.

26:00.461 --> 26:02.203
I mean, yeah.

26:02.263 --> 26:03.064
Yeah.

26:03.805 --> 26:09.751
And I think it has a lot to do with weather conditions, pilot, you know, who the pilots were.

26:10.312 --> 26:15.558
Some of it you think maybe it was just lucky that they had everything working right at the same time.

26:15.758 --> 26:17.560
Yeah, but it's all part of the...

26:19.312 --> 26:25.803
I don't know what the mystery is, but there's a better, there's a stronger word than that.

26:25.823 --> 26:30.692
They were really, that's what I'm looking for.

26:30.732 --> 26:33.056
They weren't formal research.

26:33.096 --> 26:42.552
They really weren't trained in that, which is maybe one of the reasons they were successful, because they were willing to roll the dice and to experiment and to go.

26:43.055 --> 26:45.478
There's no one's gone before.

26:45.698 --> 26:46.439
That's okay.

26:46.459 --> 26:48.060
Yeah, they're quite afraid.

26:48.421 --> 26:49.702
Yeah.

26:49.722 --> 26:50.503
I think you're right.

26:50.543 --> 26:56.109
They thought everything through very methodically and very carefully.

26:56.149 --> 27:08.221
They didn't just, and Tom would probably say this too, that other inventors at the time would build something and go out and try to fly it without really testing the parts to see if they were all going to work together.

27:08.281 --> 27:10.544
And that's something the Wrights did very carefully.

27:10.784 --> 27:11.965
They built their own wind tunnels.

27:12.552 --> 27:20.443
They built wind balances and they ended up building their own propellers because they couldn't find one on the market that would suit what they needed.

27:21.164 --> 27:26.791
There wasn't an engine for the airplane that suited what they needed, their requirements.

27:26.951 --> 27:32.919
And so they designed it and worked with a local mechanic, Charlie Taylor, to build their own engine.

27:33.340 --> 27:40.109
And so they went through the steps and the process of invention was a little different than other people at the time.

27:40.129 --> 27:42.272
Another person that

27:42.657 --> 27:49.744
besides Tom or besides Ken Hyde, would be Howard DuFour, who has researched the engine of the Wright Brothers.

27:51.145 --> 27:52.747
Howard is a model maker himself.

27:52.967 --> 27:54.548
D-U-F-O-U-R?

27:55.049 --> 27:55.930
D-U-F-O-U-R.

27:56.610 --> 27:57.611
And he's a local person.

27:57.711 --> 28:03.137
I'd give you his number, too, and he would be delighted to talk with you, but would you call him and be prepared to talk a long time.

28:04.898 --> 28:05.339
But he's a Dayton guy.

28:05.459 --> 28:06.300
He's a Dayton guy.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.401
He's 89 years old.

28:07.441 --> 28:08.322
Oh, great.

28:09.142 --> 28:11.905
And he has a couple patents to his own name.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.960
And he researched the engine, right?

28:13.980 --> 28:18.568
He has researched the engine to the T. Yeah, he knows.

28:18.588 --> 28:20.411
And actually, he wrote a book about it.

28:20.731 --> 28:25.820
He wrote a book about it, and we could give him a copy of the Charlie Taylor book, too.

28:26.381 --> 28:33.032
But Howard is somebody who's somewhat of a self-made... Whatever you can spare.

28:33.052 --> 28:35.936
Okay, we'll give you a real packet of things.

28:35.956 --> 28:36.998
This is going to work.

28:37.197 --> 28:43.564
But Howard is somebody who identifies with the Wrights and Charlie Taylor because he's kind of a self-made person.

28:43.604 --> 28:51.854
He doesn't have much formal education either, and yet he ended up working at Monsanto on nuclear projects, on the Manhattan Project.

28:51.974 --> 28:56.920
So he's one of these people that... This pairs up beautifully, you know.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.942
I think that we were talking about this in Florida.

29:00.464 --> 29:03.087
I have this scene that I've written after this.

29:03.404 --> 29:09.429
And, of course, it's local to me in Massachusetts, but it's Goddard, you know, the past president of the Goddard Library.

29:09.449 --> 29:10.410
Yeah, I did that.

29:10.691 --> 29:22.761
And, you know, Lindbergh, just before he died, well, in his autobiography and values, I think, he said, you know, his great hero was Robert Goddard, Lindbergh.

29:22.781 --> 29:33.411
He said, this is the guy that, and he went to see him before Goddard died in Worcester, which is, but Goddard, of course, is a very formally written

29:33.695 --> 29:35.198
a formally educated guy.

29:35.218 --> 29:36.300
Everything is documented.

29:36.520 --> 29:44.055
When World War II ends, they asked the German scientists that we captured, Ron Brown, where did you learn how to make these rockets?

29:44.075 --> 29:46.580
And they said, well, ask your Dr. Goddard.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.582
He knows more about it than anything.

29:47.602 --> 29:52.792
He read his books, you know, and we read his patents, we read his articles.

29:52.972 --> 29:53.593
But now you can just

29:54.367 --> 30:01.515
I contrast that so nicely with the two great flight achievements of the 20th century.

30:02.136 --> 30:08.824
The Wright Brothers and Goddard, they both kind of come at it from different, and they're both successful.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.367
It's kind of like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson.

30:11.427 --> 30:13.429
Abraham Lincoln never goes beyond the second day.

30:13.589 --> 30:22.720
Jefferson is the first president to have a college degree, also brilliant.

30:22.936 --> 30:26.681
I think this is really wonderful for me.

30:27.502 --> 30:29.064
They're a fascinating pair.

30:29.505 --> 30:29.605
Yeah.

30:30.566 --> 30:37.535
And all this material kind of started coming over here when, or something like that, or more later than that?

30:37.575 --> 30:40.739
We received our Wright Brothers collection in 1975.

30:40.759 --> 30:42.061
Oh, which is fairly recent.

30:42.501 --> 30:42.942
Yeah.

30:43.062 --> 30:47.087
The Library of Congress was given first choice at the collection here in Dayton.

30:47.107 --> 30:49.230
It was sitting in the basement of Ivanette's home.

30:49.902 --> 30:55.489
for many, many years, boxes full of all these photographs and glass plates and diaries and letters.

30:55.509 --> 30:57.392
She talks about that in here?

30:57.412 --> 30:58.694
I think so, yeah.

31:00.155 --> 31:05.222
So the Library of Congress came to Dayton right after Orville died in the 1948-49 period.

31:05.843 --> 31:07.265
And they took back to D.C.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.209
the glass plate natives, about three or four hundred glass plates.

31:10.749 --> 31:14.374
They took their diaries and journals that documented flights.

31:14.843 --> 31:21.054
They took a body of correspondence, the letters that they had received or written to other people of the time.

31:21.074 --> 31:26.083
They left behind what we got.

31:27.024 --> 31:33.696
And what we got was all of the family material, all of their father's diaries, almost 4,000 prints.

31:34.148 --> 31:37.254
many of which from those glass plates, original prints.

31:37.415 --> 31:38.958
I don't know, but I'm glad they did.

31:40.942 --> 31:43.507
We got, you know, things like their report cards.

31:43.707 --> 31:46.393
We eventually received all of the medals and awards.

31:46.553 --> 31:48.918
Except today, it's really a material artifact.

31:48.938 --> 31:49.819
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:50.180 --> 31:54.148
We have a couple propellers from the Wright Brothers hanging on our walls here.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.504
They're Michelin trophies at the entrance to the archives here.

31:57.564 --> 32:00.068
I don't know if you stopped to see that.

32:00.088 --> 32:01.049
You want to take a picture.

32:01.069 --> 32:01.169
Yeah.

32:01.189 --> 32:01.750
Yes, absolutely.

32:01.770 --> 32:09.821
So in the 70s, the family was looking for a local home for the rest of the collection, and Wright State was a fairly young university at the time.

32:09.881 --> 32:15.328
We started as a branch campus of Ohio State and Miami University at Oxford in 1964.

32:15.348 --> 32:23.359
In 67, we became an independent state university, and we were named after the Wright brothers.

32:23.997 --> 32:28.987
So we were only, what, ten years old when the family was looking for a home.

32:29.027 --> 32:31.572
And we said, hey, you know.

32:31.653 --> 32:33.657
So this institution was founded when?

32:33.877 --> 32:34.819
1967?

32:34.839 --> 32:36.362
57 would be the first.

32:36.382 --> 32:36.863
67, yeah.

32:36.883 --> 32:40.791
67, we became an independent state university.

32:41.682 --> 32:44.146
In 77, we signed the deed for the collection.

32:44.186 --> 32:50.436
So in 30-something, 37 years or whatever, you really do have a preeminent collection.

32:50.456 --> 32:50.636
It is.

32:50.656 --> 32:53.441
It's very unusual for an institution of this kind.

32:53.461 --> 33:01.193
A lot of the regionals, very young state universities, don't get into archives and special collections at all.

33:01.409 --> 33:07.257
They've been preempted by the ... Oh, yeah, by the flagship, by the Ohio States of the world.

33:07.277 --> 33:07.437
Exactly.

33:07.717 --> 33:11.923
But we were very fortunate, just a concatenation of circumstances.

33:12.484 --> 33:16.409
We end up with this collection, and of course, we're a semestral from the Wright-Patt.

33:16.449 --> 33:20.875
We have a physical ambiance here being so close to the Wright-Patt.

33:22.297 --> 33:24.179
I mean, you basically adjoined the year.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.180
Yeah, exactly.

33:25.241 --> 33:30.167
Part of the land the university's on was deeded to us by Wright-Patterson Forest Base.

33:30.367 --> 33:37.238
And then we end up with this wonderful collection, and so it's a natural for us to get into that.

33:37.258 --> 33:38.760
You must have been pretty busy last year.

33:39.421 --> 33:42.767
Oh, boy, that's an understatement.

33:42.787 --> 33:43.247
Is that right?

33:43.388 --> 33:46.352
The collection, it attracted so much attention.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.937
I mean, the whole world celebrated the centennial of flight.

33:48.997 --> 33:51.761
It's not something that was a local Dayton celebration.

33:52.342 --> 33:55.547
It's a worldwide event, and we were a source.

33:56.033 --> 34:02.821
for everybody who was making a film, a documentary, a book, a children's, you know, educational curriculum, exhibits.

34:04.022 --> 34:10.109
We had calls from literally all over the world from people who wanted to build an airplane, build a replica and try to fly it.

34:10.610 --> 34:16.296
So we were very much in demand last year for information and images.

34:16.316 --> 34:17.638
Don't mind me.

34:17.658 --> 34:18.218
Don't mind you.

34:21.362 --> 34:22.243
That's right.

34:22.477 --> 34:27.864
I don't think anybody here in the archives who worked with this collection sat still last year for more than a minute.

34:28.786 --> 34:34.434
You'll want to show Nick, too, the Brazilian newspaper.

34:34.454 --> 34:35.956
You'll need to see that.

34:35.976 --> 34:36.536
It's a huge possibility.

34:38.279 --> 34:39.240
You'll need to see that.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.442
Yeah.

34:40.462 --> 34:52.078
We were interviewed a lot during the last couple of years for information on the rights, and one of the things I was asked to talk about was the controversy between Alberto Santos Dumont, the Brazilian aviator,

34:52.598 --> 34:54.341
and the Wright brothers, who flew first.

34:55.002 --> 35:01.231
The Brazilians say Santos Dumont did, and are very adamant and passionate about it, passionate about it.

35:01.571 --> 35:03.735
And of course, the U.S.

35:03.795 --> 35:07.720
and Dayton and us, we promote Wright brothers as the first to fly.

35:07.740 --> 35:09.523
Well, do they have any documentation?

35:09.543 --> 35:14.771
They have some documentation, but it's— The lessons used to claim they invented baseball on the helicopter.

35:15.432 --> 35:22.302
I think it's well documented that Wilbur and Orville were the first at having a successful powered aircraft.

35:22.855 --> 35:26.819
I got called to do an interview for a Brazilian newspaper at Sao Paulo.

35:26.839 --> 35:29.042
I think it's like the third largest newspaper in Brazil.

35:29.923 --> 35:32.165
And I gave my side of the story based on what I knew.

35:32.225 --> 35:37.111
The facts were that Santos Dumas, yeah, he was an aviation pioneer, but he wasn't first.

35:37.331 --> 35:40.575
The Wright Brothers had done much more earlier than he did, and it's documented.

35:41.335 --> 35:45.200
But they are very adamant that he should be given much more credit than he was given.

35:47.883 --> 35:52.828
When I got a copy of the newspaper, I was pitted with, I don't know if you know who Paul Hoffman is?

35:53.382 --> 36:00.452
He wrote a book on Santos Dumont recently, but he was also an editor for Science Magazine, Discovery Channel, and he's very well-known, I guess, in newspaper circles.

36:01.554 --> 36:03.577
But here we are, and I'll show you the newspaper.

36:03.637 --> 36:06.421
I'm on one side promoting the Wright Brothers, and he's on the other side.

36:06.501 --> 36:10.567
It's a full-page color article, my head and his head.

36:11.047 --> 36:12.910
And he's this famous person, and I'm the

36:13.193 --> 36:14.796
Archivist from Dayton, Ohio.

36:14.816 --> 36:16.338
But you're working with the stuff, though.

36:16.358 --> 36:16.779
Yeah.

36:17.180 --> 36:19.303
You've got the documents on your site.

36:19.323 --> 36:19.965
I think so.

36:20.225 --> 36:22.589
But he's promoting Santos Dumont.

36:22.629 --> 36:23.631
Of course, it's all in Portuguese.

36:23.651 --> 36:25.374
Did you spell this fellow's name?

36:25.514 --> 36:29.020
Oh, Alberto Santos Dumont.

36:29.641 --> 36:31.825
Santos, S-A-N-T-O-S.

36:32.085 --> 36:34.569
And then Dumont, D-U-M-O-N-T.

36:35.731 --> 36:36.653
He's...

36:37.088 --> 36:42.237
He was a Brazilian who went to... Right.

36:42.337 --> 36:45.522
He was flying dirigibles, airships.

36:45.542 --> 36:49.188
Oh, okay, so you know about Dumont.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.651
Quite a bit, yeah.

36:50.731 --> 36:55.579
And I think the important point is how do you define controllables?

36:55.599 --> 36:56.300
Exactly.

36:56.761 --> 36:59.586
Right.

37:00.157 --> 37:03.123
See, we have aviation, and this is Barbara.

37:03.183 --> 37:03.604
Hi, Barbara.

37:03.664 --> 37:05.167
No, this is great.

37:05.187 --> 37:07.551
Believe me, this is all grist for the mill.

37:07.571 --> 37:12.000
I'm sorry, if I'm saying anything wrong, please jump in.

37:12.661 --> 37:14.866
The budget of Mars was started as a balloonist.

37:14.886 --> 37:19.735
He was an aeronaut, and he had people flying gliders in Europe.

37:20.052 --> 37:24.516
But the important point is the concept of control.

37:24.596 --> 37:25.997
Control, exactly.

37:26.017 --> 37:28.119
And so that puts them apart.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.701
I think that's why they belong.

37:29.721 --> 37:32.543
They're playing with a little bit different.

37:32.563 --> 37:34.665
And powered flight, that was this guy?

37:34.705 --> 37:36.287
Control flight.

37:36.307 --> 37:37.668
And they could turn.

37:37.688 --> 37:40.571
The idea of banking is what's really cool.

37:40.631 --> 37:42.472
So the heli-lines and the... Right.

37:42.572 --> 37:44.354
Well, heli-lines came later.

37:44.434 --> 37:48.878
I think Curtis introduced that, but it's really a French concept.

37:48.858 --> 37:53.223
But the idea of a wing war being able to go by or left, and no one has seen that in Europe.

37:54.144 --> 37:57.588
The Rites got a lot of recognition when they went to Europe.

37:58.009 --> 38:01.013
They somehow drive you to the kids down here so much.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.395
We had the Europe every once in a while.

38:03.435 --> 38:04.537
That's correct.

38:04.577 --> 38:08.421
Now, are you a writer or a researcher?

38:08.542 --> 38:09.383
I'm a historian.

38:09.803 --> 38:13.127
I'm working on a book on women and names during the Golden Age.

38:13.107 --> 38:14.208
And what brings you here?

38:14.589 --> 38:16.671
Where are you from?

38:16.811 --> 38:26.443
I'm from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton.

38:27.123 --> 38:30.648
I met Barbara at the E.C.

38:30.688 --> 38:32.089
The Crony reception.

38:32.129 --> 38:34.272
Barbara, what's your last name?

38:34.372 --> 38:37.115
G-A-N-S-O-N.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.638
And you're at F-A-U?

38:39.938 --> 38:47.386
But, you know, Santos Dumont, Alberto Santos Dumont, and he was a very important pioneer.

38:47.486 --> 38:50.970
I think we have to give him a lot of recognition.

38:51.070 --> 38:52.411
Oh, yeah.

38:52.491 --> 38:57.116
And that's what I said in my interview.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.079
He is a pioneer.

39:00.239 --> 39:01.160
He gives credit.

39:01.180 --> 39:02.101
A lot of people did.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.302
Yeah.

39:03.503 --> 39:04.163
That's the key.

39:04.183 --> 39:05.845
You couldn't sell it.

39:05.825 --> 39:10.400
Probably a better way to sell your collection than to me.

39:10.641 --> 39:10.721
Yes.

39:10.902 --> 39:13.209
It doesn't do anything besides you.

39:13.229 --> 39:14.012
Oh, yeah.

39:14.279 --> 39:17.503
We can really get that.

39:17.683 --> 39:18.143
Oh, yeah.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.785
It's almost like a relationship.

39:19.805 --> 39:20.125
Absolutely.

39:20.146 --> 39:21.907
I'm glad you typed in.

39:22.068 --> 39:25.031
I should show you this newspaper article.

39:25.131 --> 39:26.252
It's in Portuguese.

39:26.292 --> 39:29.356
Oh, good.

39:29.396 --> 39:35.242
We had it translated by somebody so that we'd know whether they said what I said correctly and what he said.

39:36.524 --> 39:38.206
Well, that's all right.

39:38.226 --> 39:40.388
Thank you.

39:41.549 --> 39:42.069
Let's see.

39:42.290 --> 39:43.411
Where are we?

39:44.051 --> 39:46.093
We were talking about Santos Dumont.

39:46.113 --> 39:48.215
Oh, we had so many activities last year.

39:48.235 --> 39:50.056
We were very busy and in demand and all that.

39:50.677 --> 39:53.860
I think that's what we were talking about.

39:54.660 --> 39:54.761
Yeah.

39:54.781 --> 39:55.361
Excellent.

39:55.481 --> 39:57.943
I'm not sure what direction you'd like to take this morning.

39:57.983 --> 40:04.369
You can look at their library and sit down with the books and just spend some time looking at those.

40:04.429 --> 40:05.350
Stuff like that, yeah.

40:05.710 --> 40:06.030
Okay.

40:06.991 --> 40:11.235
And I can take you to the... You can either spend some time out here with the books...

40:11.485 --> 40:17.292
like Chanute's book and Lilienthal's book, or we can go to the back and I can show you some more of the collection.

40:17.592 --> 40:20.095
I would kind of like a sense of the stuff.

40:20.175 --> 40:22.277
Okay, well, let's take a walk then, maybe.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.079
Did they annotate the books at all?

40:26.022 --> 40:30.627
Chanute's book and Lilianthal's book and some of the technical reports are annotated.

40:31.027 --> 40:33.510
This list will tell you which ones are annotated.

40:33.828 --> 40:35.249
So we could pull a specific volume.

40:35.310 --> 40:38.513
Maybe we could choose a couple of pictures of where some of the annotations are.

40:38.533 --> 40:40.375
That would be kind of cool.

40:40.395 --> 40:42.076
I mean, I'm not going to have time to obviously read the books.

40:42.837 --> 40:43.258
Right.

40:43.978 --> 40:51.086
You might show, maybe the thing you do is to start out with more technical stuff and then move through there.

40:51.106 --> 40:54.189
And then just be mindful of what our time is.

40:54.289 --> 40:57.232
Basically... We're not going to have... Yeah, it's ten after ten already.

40:57.252 --> 40:58.333
Yeah, and...

40:59.056 --> 41:01.098
We'll have to be at 11.30.

41:01.178 --> 41:02.840
Well, lunch is at 11.30, isn't it?

41:02.920 --> 41:03.481
No, it's at 12.

41:03.541 --> 41:04.422
Oh, is it 12?

41:04.442 --> 41:04.562
Okay.

41:04.582 --> 41:07.105
If we leave at 11.30, then we can get there.

41:07.125 --> 41:07.965
That's about a time an hour.

41:08.306 --> 41:08.606
Okay.

41:09.267 --> 41:09.527
All right.

41:09.607 --> 41:11.049
Well, let me pull a couple of these.

41:11.069 --> 41:11.890
Should I stay here?

41:11.970 --> 41:16.214
Yeah, just stay here, and I'll pull this in here.

41:16.314 --> 41:17.876
Oh, okay.

41:17.956 --> 41:22.541
You need to have your hand in there.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.082
Oh, that's all right.

41:24.103 --> 41:24.743
No, that's good.

41:24.943 --> 41:25.384
I like that.

41:25.404 --> 41:26.305
You like hands?

41:26.325 --> 41:26.765
Yeah, I do.

41:26.925 --> 41:27.426
I like that.

41:28.300 --> 41:28.961
That's very good.

41:29.501 --> 41:31.363
Can I have a nice picture?

41:31.383 --> 41:32.465
This one is Shamit's book.

41:38.771 --> 41:39.752
Very, look at that.

41:39.772 --> 41:44.097
Red to death, isn't it?

41:44.117 --> 41:44.397
Yeah.

41:44.457 --> 41:46.139
And it has Orville's estate stamp in it.

41:52.847 --> 41:54.889
And that is Progress?

41:54.909 --> 41:56.991
Progress in flying machines.

41:58.169 --> 42:09.583
The annotations in this one, again, sometimes they're just little marks like that at other places in the book.

42:13.267 --> 42:18.253
Things might be underlined, or maybe just one little word is written along the margins.

42:18.934 --> 42:21.797
And what's your publication on this one?

42:25.642 --> 42:27.504
It was published in New York.

42:27.564 --> 42:28.324
1894.

42:28.385 --> 42:28.685
1894?

42:29.145 --> 42:29.486
Mm-hmm.

42:30.827 --> 42:32.148
So nine years before.

42:33.569 --> 42:35.131
Progress in flying machines.

42:35.271 --> 42:39.875
That is so cool.

42:39.895 --> 42:40.195
Let's see.

42:40.215 --> 42:41.096
Annotations.

42:44.620 --> 42:45.180
Here we go.

42:45.420 --> 42:48.403
Marginal alineations and notes.

42:50.725 --> 42:54.889
There's several annotations, you know, mostly just underlining.

42:55.882 --> 42:58.946
There's no, again, the Eureka thing, right?

42:58.966 --> 42:59.867
No, there isn't.

43:00.047 --> 43:01.710
You know, it's kind of frustrating in a way.

43:01.730 --> 43:04.173
You wish he would have, you know, written all over the page.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.094
Here it is.

43:06.376 --> 43:07.777
But he didn't.

43:08.638 --> 43:12.143
And this is from Orville's library, but we can assume that both brothers read this.

43:12.163 --> 43:21.535
Yeah, these particular books, they would have had in their position when Orville and Wilbur were very young, 1890s, first thinking about airplanes, gliders, and kites.

43:21.937 --> 43:27.645
Some of the later books I'll show you in the back of the archives are when, you know, later stuff that Orville would have accumulated.

43:27.685 --> 43:29.287
But these two, yeah.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.951
These are all the cited.

43:32.031 --> 43:32.832
They're all, yeah.

43:32.852 --> 43:35.295
I don't even have to worry about waiting on that.

43:35.315 --> 43:36.256
Yeah, they're all right here.

43:37.779 --> 43:43.346
Like here's a little bitty small.

43:43.366 --> 43:49.935
Very good, yeah.

43:54.286 --> 43:54.746
This is good.

43:55.287 --> 43:55.847
This is helpful.

43:56.068 --> 43:56.988
Yeah, it's great.

44:00.371 --> 44:01.793
Yeah, it's fascinating to see that.

44:02.733 --> 44:06.317
You'd be amazed at details, but the kind of things that I really like.

44:06.897 --> 44:11.001
This is Lilienthal's bird flight.

44:11.021 --> 44:23.972
And this is the— Lilienthal was a German glider pilot, an inventor, and the Wrights really respected Lilienthal for his early experiments and studied his tables

44:24.273 --> 44:50.533
of um lift and other scientific data that he accumulated on his gliding flight and they followed his very closely until they discovered that his tables were wrong this is a case where they were willing to not accept what was the accepted you know statistics or or information at the time is this his seal or is this something that was this was put

44:50.733 --> 44:54.858
into the books when Orville passed away to identify them as a part of his estate.

44:54.938 --> 44:55.218
Okay.

44:55.379 --> 45:00.304
And then the signature is that of Harold S. Miller, who was Ivanette's husband, who was one of the executors.

45:00.324 --> 45:00.885
So this is that?

45:01.085 --> 45:01.826
This is later.

45:01.906 --> 45:04.429
Yeah, this was put on 1948, 49.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.472
So they didn't have a book plate?

45:06.492 --> 45:07.073
No, they didn't.

45:07.553 --> 45:08.835
No, I've never seen one.

45:10.296 --> 45:11.318
Here's a little bit more.

45:11.818 --> 45:12.759
Who's the?

45:12.819 --> 45:13.500
Oh, there we go.

45:13.520 --> 45:14.341
Here's some more notes.

45:14.581 --> 45:15.583
This one might be better yet.

45:17.585 --> 45:18.246
Well, what is this?

45:18.266 --> 45:20.048
Well, we think these are Orville's.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.883
writings later on.

45:23.383 --> 45:24.004
We're not sure.

45:24.024 --> 45:27.468
These aren't dated, so we don't know when he did this.

45:27.488 --> 45:32.454
So what we're looking at is, we're taking a picture of it.

45:32.474 --> 45:34.496
These are Orville's handwritten?

45:34.837 --> 45:39.322
Handwritten notes concerning what he's reading in Lilienthal's book, we assume.

45:42.246 --> 45:47.272
And again, we're not sure if this is Wilbur or Orville, you know, doing notations.

45:47.332 --> 45:49.174
We think that Wilbur probably would

45:49.508 --> 45:54.896
would have been the first one to really peruse these books in detail.

45:55.857 --> 45:59.322
And then Orville got interested along with them a little bit later.

45:59.342 --> 46:02.547
But these two are probably there.

46:02.587 --> 46:03.789
We've got X's.

46:03.889 --> 46:06.353
We've got underlines.

46:06.373 --> 46:06.473
Yeah.

46:06.493 --> 46:07.134
We've got some more.

46:10.278 --> 46:11.440
What they're really interested in.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.523
This forces upon us the conviction.

46:13.563 --> 46:14.925
This is page 23.

46:15.412 --> 46:27.307
that our knowledge of the actual mechanical processes of bird flight can only be increased by a successful research into the laws of air resistance, and that such knowledge will finally yield us the means of technical success.

46:27.888 --> 46:38.000
Bird flight is a method of flight which requires comparatively little energy, and only when we have found a true explanation of that shall we find the means for an exploitation of its advantages."

46:38.040 --> 46:41.925
And this is something that either Wilbur or Orville has

46:42.597 --> 46:44.699
Highlighted in some way, yeah.

46:44.719 --> 46:52.826
Highlighted with a vertical strike of a pencil, and that seems to be really interesting to them, and I'm going to take a picture of it.

46:52.846 --> 46:56.630
And it's sort of an abstract of the way they perceive it, too.

46:56.650 --> 46:57.250
Say that again?

46:57.470 --> 47:00.633
It's an abstract of their methods and their procedures.

47:00.653 --> 47:03.156
Here's another one where... Question mark.

47:03.176 --> 47:03.936
Oh, that's great.

47:03.956 --> 47:04.597
Page 12.

47:04.937 --> 47:12.604
Only that air resistance is generally known, which is produced when we move a thin plane surface in a direction at right angles to its plane.

47:15.487 --> 47:25.060
Yeah, he's put a question mark on that.

47:25.080 --> 47:32.070
Well, and actually, this is Lilienthal's book, and he's referring to— Oh, wow.

47:32.170 --> 47:34.133
Page XXI.

47:35.114 --> 47:36.155
Why don't you read this?

47:36.175 --> 47:36.276
Okay.

47:36.937 --> 47:45.308
I had, as similarly related of the Brothers Wright, endeavored to construct on a larger scale the small flyers moved by a rubber spring

47:45.727 --> 47:48.430
then much patronized and known as Japanese flies.

47:51.372 --> 47:55.817
Of course, they note that they're in reference to themselves.

47:55.837 --> 47:57.358
And what year is this book?

48:02.022 --> 48:02.803
1911.

48:03.244 --> 48:03.764
Okay.

48:03.784 --> 48:05.185
This is eight years after.

48:05.205 --> 48:06.787
This is a reprint, I think.

48:06.847 --> 48:09.750
Or it's a later edition of the first one.

48:09.770 --> 48:11.211
This was originally printed in German.

48:11.431 --> 48:13.253
Let me grab the German.

48:16.422 --> 48:21.890
The point here is they've already been successful, right?

48:22.110 --> 48:23.933
This is 1889.

48:25.355 --> 48:27.598
It was Lilienthal's original work.

48:28.079 --> 48:33.787
This has been updated with an addendum by Gustaf, which I think is his son.

48:34.608 --> 48:43.581
Because Lilienthal was killed in 1899, I think?

48:43.601 --> 48:43.721
1889.

48:43.741 --> 48:45.163
So this is the original.

48:46.105 --> 48:47.727
Do you think they read any of this in the German?

48:48.227 --> 48:48.888
It's possible.

48:48.928 --> 48:57.117
Their mother was of German descent, and there may have been some German spoken in the household, and they probably had a basic knowledge.

48:57.137 --> 48:57.838
I'm not sure.

48:57.898 --> 49:07.069
I can't say for sure if they actually read it in German or not.

49:07.089 --> 49:07.409
Great.

49:08.050 --> 49:10.893
Well, are there any annotations?

49:10.913 --> 49:12.855
In the German, probably not.

49:13.257 --> 49:16.201
I think the ones that we've done so far in the English version.

49:16.742 --> 49:19.587
So this, what we were just reading, was a new preface, probably.

49:19.607 --> 49:19.907
Mm-hmm.

49:20.187 --> 49:24.915
Yeah, I believe so.

49:24.975 --> 49:27.058
So, birthright is the basis of aviation.

49:27.238 --> 49:27.919
Mm-hmm.

49:27.939 --> 49:30.423
A contribution towards a system of aviation.

49:31.805 --> 49:35.771
Compiled from the results of numerous experiments made by O.N.G.

49:36.933 --> 49:37.874
Lilianthal.

49:38.916 --> 49:40.378
Good.

49:43.936 --> 50:02.762
Terrific.

50:02.782 --> 50:03.903
That was a German title.

50:04.965 --> 50:05.766
These are all from Orville?

50:05.786 --> 50:11.614
Yeah, these books belong to Orville and Wilbur.

50:11.982 --> 50:16.429
If you hadn't thought of repairing or anything like that, this is kind of the... At least for now.

50:16.449 --> 50:21.497
I mean, a lot of, we don't, these are reprinted in modern versions so people can read them and handle them.

50:21.517 --> 50:22.619
So these are more artifactual.

50:22.639 --> 50:23.340
Yes.

50:23.360 --> 50:26.025
Right.

50:26.045 --> 50:28.128
And there are other books that belong to them over here.

50:28.148 --> 50:30.472
I don't know if you're interested in looking at any more of those.

50:31.033 --> 50:33.116
No, I think we've got some great examples here, actually.

50:35.840 --> 50:39.306
And these are foreign language journals that they were... Yes.

50:39.893 --> 50:41.475
French, aerofile.

50:41.695 --> 50:44.258
I'm probably saying that wrong.

50:44.439 --> 50:46.982
German, and we also have English.

50:48.343 --> 50:51.147
Some works on Langley's early experiments in flight.

50:51.167 --> 50:55.152
There's even some early books on Santos Dumont.

50:55.172 --> 50:56.253
So they studied widely.

50:56.333 --> 50:57.414
I mean, they read widely.

50:57.454 --> 50:59.978
They didn't just focus in on what they were doing.

51:00.038 --> 51:02.561
They learned from all of these other people.

51:02.581 --> 51:07.707
Of course, the dates here in 1909, so obviously it's up to...

51:08.075 --> 51:08.536
Yes.

51:09.156 --> 51:12.881
They didn't just quit in 1903.

51:12.901 --> 51:15.304
I mean, they continued to resign.

51:16.245 --> 51:20.831
Yeah, the 03 flyer was actually not a very efficient machine.

51:20.851 --> 51:22.653
No, it wouldn't be until 05.

51:22.713 --> 51:30.302
Actually, the 05 flyer is really the first of all flyable plane, and they've got that, again, in one of the museums.

51:30.485 --> 51:32.327
And what were you about to tell me over here?

51:32.347 --> 51:35.489
Just a couple other examples of the types of things they had in their library.

51:35.549 --> 51:40.513
This is J. Bell Pettigrew, 1874, animal locomotion.

51:40.614 --> 51:52.123
Again, studying birds and movement of animals and birds to figure out how did they fly.

51:52.384 --> 51:53.364
So how can we fly?

51:57.248 --> 51:59.249
And the other two you took out of here.

51:59.269 --> 52:00.070
Yeah, I took it out of the case, yeah.

52:00.893 --> 52:01.414
That's great.

52:02.316 --> 52:05.581
This is kind of the aviation parts, technical books and things.

52:06.383 --> 52:14.978
They also collected numerous technical reports that they would get from the Smithsonian or other scientific organizations, and those are all stored in the back.

52:14.998 --> 52:16.301
Is this stuff to it?

52:16.441 --> 52:19.507
This is not from the Wright Brothers.

52:19.987 --> 52:24.235
This part of the reading room, this is all aviation history.

52:24.417 --> 52:29.183
secondary sources, but books that were published at the turn of the century all the way up to the present.

52:29.223 --> 52:35.692
We still have subscriptions to modern aviation journals, or journals that have been published since the turn of the century that are still going.

52:36.673 --> 52:41.760
So this is what our researchers come in and use, in addition to the manuscript collections, to study aviation history.

52:43.843 --> 52:44.264
Terrific.

52:44.544 --> 52:46.547
So, why don't we take that?

52:46.647 --> 52:46.927
Okay.

52:47.087 --> 52:53.496
Just in case you're interested, there's Orville Wright's address book here on the wall in this little case.

52:53.729 --> 52:54.230
Right here?

52:54.370 --> 52:56.052
Yep.

52:56.072 --> 52:59.356
And it's really a who's who of who he knew at the time.

53:01.078 --> 53:13.114
Not only a few theaters, but ordinary friends and family, of course.

53:13.134 --> 53:14.615
1905 Propeller.

53:15.797 --> 53:16.478
Oh, it's there.

53:17.099 --> 53:17.840
Wow.

53:17.860 --> 53:20.563
Propeller.

53:21.792 --> 53:41.135
Was that the one that took over and studied at the Air Force?

53:41.155 --> 53:41.856
Not this one, no.

53:41.876 --> 53:43.237
Although Ken Hyde came, I knew the 09 was out there.

53:45.320 --> 53:49.745
I'm interested in one of the military flyers here.

53:49.765 --> 53:51.647
This one Ken Hyde studied, this guy's from Virginia and did later computerized measuring the .

53:52.150 --> 54:19.390
Many awards and honors throughout their career, especially after they've traveled to Europe.

54:19.538 --> 54:25.307
and did those public flights at Le Mans and Pau, France in 08 and 09.

54:25.387 --> 54:29.733
And we have here in our collection medals that they were awarded.

54:29.833 --> 54:36.944
So we have their Congressional Medals of Honor, French Legion of Honor, City of Dayton, State of Ohio.

54:37.044 --> 54:44.635
I mean, the list goes on and on, but these are the things that they were given as awards for their accomplishments.

54:45.087 --> 54:47.570
You call them the university's crown jewels.

54:47.670 --> 54:52.116
Yeah, one of our archivists a while back came up with that title.

54:52.136 --> 54:53.858
What's that illustrated book there?

54:53.878 --> 54:56.382
We have a collection of children's literature.

54:57.323 --> 54:59.646
Some of the books have been illustrated by Arthur Rackham.

54:59.726 --> 55:03.471
They do some displays of different books.

55:03.491 --> 55:12.242
So these are unrelated to the... Very unrelated to the aviation, although we do have some really good early books on juvenile literature on aviation.

55:12.728 --> 55:15.593
that we have stored around the corner here.

55:15.613 --> 55:16.634
There's another propeller.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.799
This is a bent-end propeller, later model.

55:19.839 --> 55:28.473
This was used around 1912, 1913 on a later right aircraft in the early paper tip.

55:28.493 --> 55:30.115
Oh, handmade, to be sure.

55:31.978 --> 55:32.119
Uh-huh.

55:32.159 --> 55:35.804
The framed picture of the first flight there went up on the space shuttle two years ago.

55:35.824 --> 55:36.425
That one there?

55:36.546 --> 55:36.886
Uh-huh.

55:37.126 --> 55:37.868
Great.

55:37.888 --> 55:38.128
Yep.

55:38.986 --> 55:43.051
I was really nervous when we sent it out, but it came back safely, so.

55:44.192 --> 55:46.736
But that's one of the original prints from the collection.

55:46.756 --> 55:54.065
Well, let's go towards the back and I'll show you some more of the actual material.

55:54.085 --> 55:54.706
Well, I'm just reading it.

55:54.766 --> 55:59.191
It says, the White Brothers' first flight lasted 12 seconds and covered a distance of 120 feet.

55:59.912 --> 56:06.360
The flight of the space shuttle Atlantis lasted just under 11 days and covered a distance of about 4.5 million miles.

56:06.880 --> 56:07.741
Isn't that great?

56:07.761 --> 56:09.063
Kind of amazing, isn't it?

56:12.368 --> 56:12.888
Yeah.

56:12.908 --> 56:25.085
It's kind of cool when one of the documents I'm interested in from Goddard, I think it was like 1919, he wrote a little pamphlet on the feasibility of attaining high altitudes, you know.

56:25.105 --> 56:29.652
And it was ignored and it was ridiculed and belittled, including the New York Times.

56:30.573 --> 56:34.238
And 35 years ago yesterday, when...

56:34.606 --> 56:39.190
The first moon landing was taking place, the New York Times apologized in an editorial.

56:39.250 --> 56:40.311
We were wrong, they said.

56:42.614 --> 56:44.355
Leave the little Dr. Goddard.

56:44.395 --> 56:46.737
Here's a few more of the items from the collection.

56:46.757 --> 56:48.919
You can see some of the early newspapers.

56:48.939 --> 56:52.843
You might be interested in what the Wright Brothers printed themselves.

56:52.923 --> 56:55.125
This is a copy of their West Side News.

56:56.487 --> 57:01.031
Let me know if I can move it right there.

57:01.051 --> 57:03.313
This one dates to 1889.

57:04.492 --> 57:33.148
they first got started um in printing in the late mid-late 1880s and printed you know local neighborhood newspaper the west side years and they also printed the evening items they did a little bit of printing for our african-american author and poet here from dayton um

57:33.382 --> 57:42.690
The wonderful thing about this particular issue is on the back, they printed a tribute to their mother who had passed away from tuberculosis.

57:43.591 --> 57:45.192
Where's the date on it?

57:45.212 --> 57:47.874
This one is 1889, July 3rd.

57:47.894 --> 57:51.878
So they were printers.

57:52.098 --> 57:55.681
They were printers before they were bicycle makers and airplane builders.

57:57.102 --> 58:02.747
Maybe just some other newspapers from when Will passed away at typhoid in Orville Wright, 1948.

58:06.305 --> 58:08.067
A true man, a Dayton mechanic.

58:08.347 --> 58:09.368
He conquered the air.

58:10.529 --> 58:11.750
Kings and people honor him.

58:11.790 --> 58:13.031
The world mourns its loss.

58:13.092 --> 58:14.253
That's June 1, 1912.

58:14.273 --> 58:15.694
The flags are at half-match.

58:15.714 --> 58:19.197
Today is a token of respect and a memory of William Wilbur Wright.

58:19.918 --> 58:24.443
NCR Weekly is... National Pass Register Company here in Dayton.

58:24.463 --> 58:24.723
Oh, Dayton.

58:24.743 --> 58:25.163
Yep, there you go.

58:27.826 --> 58:29.728
I didn't realize how big a city Dayton is.

58:32.150 --> 58:35.333
Um, where we keep the collection.

58:35.650 --> 58:37.913
half the free boxes in the cupboards here.

58:38.735 --> 58:41.779
I've pulled a few of the things that you might be interested in.

58:42.260 --> 58:51.573
These are the books that are in, they're more of general reading sorts of things from their collection, and I have a complete list of all these books that I have on the table out there for you.

58:51.714 --> 58:52.535
Good.

58:53.436 --> 59:04.813
Some of what's interesting about these books is after Wilbur died in 1912 and after Orville and Catherine, I mean, they've become famous, all three of them, including Catherine, because of their travels and because of their inventions.

59:05.367 --> 59:13.057
They met so many famous people, and many authors included, and they would be given gifts of books by these authors, and they're signed.

59:14.359 --> 59:21.989
They got to know Vilhamar Stephenson, the Arctic explorer, and he wrote several books and autographed them for Catherine or Orville.

59:22.830 --> 59:26.835
There are books in there from, if I can remember some of the authors,

59:27.895 --> 59:33.803
Their names escape me now, but they moved in circles where they were meeting a lot of these famous people.

59:33.883 --> 59:39.070
Any big important one that might be interesting for me to take a photograph of an inscription to them?

59:39.911 --> 59:41.573
I'll go grab the list.

59:41.894 --> 59:45.799
Why don't you sit down and look at things here, and we'll look and see if you can pick one.

59:45.859 --> 59:47.221
Okay.

59:47.241 --> 59:52.468
Is there any evidence that they read any of these books?

59:53.596 --> 59:54.938
Well, nothing in writing.

59:56.100 --> 59:58.424
But I mean, there are no annotations.

59:58.745 --> 01:00:02.631
Although I think there are a lot of bird books in this.

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:08.221
Why does that not surprise me?

01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:11.607
They moved to Hawthorne Hill, where you'll see this afternoon.

01:00:11.647 --> 01:00:17.697
Orville had visitors who were orthodontologists and plants and tree people.
