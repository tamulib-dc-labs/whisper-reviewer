00:02.562 --> 00:04.003
Okay, you're going to tell me a story.

00:04.684 --> 00:10.770
Very brief story of... Please, let me get you a clean... No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:16.876 --> 00:20.659
I promise you we will... Okay.

00:20.679 --> 00:27.606
Brief story is he and some friends have a game they play in the ghetto.

00:28.887 --> 00:32.130
And the game is you run into the Jewish cemetery,

00:32.414 --> 00:34.397
at night, which is very scary.

00:34.837 --> 00:36.600
You're bleeding ghosts.

00:36.620 --> 00:43.148
And you run as far into, in the dark of the night, and you put a stick into the ground.

00:43.589 --> 00:48.936
And in the morning, the stick that is furthest into the cemetery is the bravest of the kids, okay?

00:50.318 --> 00:50.919
He did this.

00:51.379 --> 01:00.792
And one night, they all did this, and he ran, and they heard a blood-curdling scream, and they didn't wait to look and see.

01:00.812 --> 01:01.813
They just ran home,

01:02.317 --> 01:07.343
And in the morning, this was the story that stayed with me and scared me to death.

01:08.104 --> 01:11.328
In the morning, they found one of their friends dead.

01:11.969 --> 01:18.517
And what these little boys wore, these long Cossack things, what do you call them?

01:18.597 --> 01:22.742
Religious Jews wear, it's like a coat, like a silken coat.

01:22.762 --> 01:28.710
And in his desperation to get furthest into the cemetery, he plunged a stick, but he went through his own coat.

01:29.270 --> 01:31.513
So he couldn't, so he thought of dead hands.

01:31.932 --> 01:35.256
was pulling him down on the ground, and he got a heart failure.

01:35.276 --> 01:35.857
He screamed.

01:35.977 --> 01:37.839
That was a scream they heard, and he got a heart failure.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.104
And my father must have told me thousands of stories.

01:42.124 --> 01:46.109
It's the only one I remember, because I saw it as he was telling me.

01:46.469 --> 01:52.436
I saw the little boy in the dark, trying to move, and not being able to move, so somebody's pulling him into the grave.

01:54.138 --> 01:56.220
I still get the chills as I tell the story.

01:56.481 --> 02:01.146
But that's the kind of story, and he didn't stop to think that this was...

02:01.767 --> 02:06.312
This certainly had a lot to do with the storyteller that you referred.

02:06.332 --> 02:09.795
Yeah, it's a vivid, passionate storyteller.

02:09.815 --> 02:23.469
Or Adam being, this one you mustn't take off this thing, Adam being a very good religious Jew, Eve being a taunting Gentile lady.

02:23.489 --> 02:26.572
That's how the whole trouble worked, if he stayed with a Jewish girl.

02:26.913 --> 02:31.217
There was no Jewish girl, there was only her.

02:31.585 --> 02:35.829
If you had something coming in 10 minutes, let me just get a couple of questions in.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.452
You call books love objects.

02:38.692 --> 02:38.972
Yeah.

02:39.353 --> 02:40.193
What do you mean by that?

02:41.375 --> 02:53.827
I sniff them, hug them, press them, great paper, pure red paper smells delicious, glue inside binding, end papers, the surface of just the sensuous objects.

02:54.708 --> 02:58.211
I used to go to bed with books the way kids go to bed with teddy bears.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.293
I had a favorite book my sister gave me.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.207
felt and smelled wonderful.

03:02.608 --> 03:03.749
I took it to bed with me.

03:03.769 --> 03:04.630
You got The Prince and the Poplar.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.812
It was The Prince and the Poplar.

03:05.832 --> 03:12.080
I still have that same mangled copy from, you know, all my sexual assaults on that book.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.222
The book has survived.

03:14.023 --> 03:15.826
And that's what I mean by that.

03:15.866 --> 03:18.549
And when you do a book on a... But where does that come from?

03:19.150 --> 03:19.891
I have no idea.

03:20.031 --> 03:20.492
I have no idea.

03:20.512 --> 03:21.854
Did you always love the books?

03:22.114 --> 03:23.376
Always loved the books.

03:23.616 --> 03:24.497
Always loved the books.

03:24.577 --> 03:25.899
And it's almost like genetic.

03:27.121 --> 03:28.643
My brother and my sister and

03:29.281 --> 03:35.329
Don't forget, I was nine years younger, and then my sister was five years younger than my brother.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.133
By the time I came into it, they were a reading library already.

03:38.153 --> 03:40.916
I mean, there was an investment in reading my mother and father read.

03:41.758 --> 03:43.760
They belonged to Yiddish clubs.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.883
There were tons of books all over the house.

03:46.264 --> 03:49.147
It was just the most natural thing in the world.

03:49.207 --> 03:55.015
The added attraction, the beauty of books was something that, I don't know where that comes from.

03:56.557 --> 03:57.178
Exactly.

03:57.547 --> 03:59.149
Do you want some decap?

03:59.169 --> 03:59.910
Or regular coffee.

04:00.030 --> 04:01.332
It's instant.

04:01.472 --> 04:01.832
You know what?

04:01.853 --> 04:02.593
Do you have any more of this?

04:02.694 --> 04:03.254
Oh, yeah.

04:04.496 --> 04:10.003
I'll skip it, too.

04:11.024 --> 04:17.012
You mentioned how you touch the objects and something comes from the object or the object.

04:17.473 --> 04:23.240
But there are certain things that you've got even to get closer to the artist and the writer.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.663
You mentioned in one piece how

04:26.200 --> 04:30.024
When you were in Amsterdam, you went to visit Anne Frank and Van Gogh every day.

04:30.044 --> 04:31.765
That was true.

04:32.346 --> 04:34.588
We mentioned Buick.

04:35.789 --> 04:38.132
What have you done to get close to Melville, for instance?

04:38.372 --> 04:39.333
His first edition.

04:39.593 --> 04:40.634
His first edition.

04:40.734 --> 04:41.675
I have.

04:41.695 --> 04:43.737
Have you ever worked physically to where he's been?

04:43.757 --> 04:44.478
Oh, of course.

04:45.058 --> 04:47.080
Sat in his chairs, lie down in his beds?

04:48.101 --> 04:49.783
Not that I'm telling.

04:50.263 --> 04:51.985
I've been to Arrowhead.

04:52.506 --> 04:54.047
I've been allowed to go to a study.

04:54.719 --> 04:58.964
I was allowed to sit in the chair that he sat in when he wrote Bobby Dick.

04:58.984 --> 05:07.774
I could see Greylock, my grey locks for the window, who we dedicated Pierre to, because he'd given up on people and dedicated books to mountains after that.

05:09.295 --> 05:13.820
I have had endless private conversations with Noble, studied his photographs.

05:14.641 --> 05:19.787
When Herschel Parker wrote a big biography that came out, I did The Jacket.

05:19.967 --> 05:20.828
That's a beautiful book.

05:21.044 --> 05:25.469
It's a beautiful book.

05:25.670 --> 05:38.565
No, I've gotten as close as a live person can get to a dead person through imaginary means, through aesthetic means, through reading, through collecting their first editions, through smelling their letters, through examining their handwriting.

05:39.066 --> 05:50.460
I have Mozart letters where addressed to his father, I can't believe the same hand who wrote the concertos that I love and the symphonies that I love, the operas that I love, this is the same hand.

05:50.862 --> 06:18.962
hand like my hand around there yeah the smell is on there his palm as he wrote is on there it's does it inspire your work does it get into your work yeah are we getting mystical here i can't i'm not a mystical man no i'm a very pragmatic person but something happens something happens and i don't know what it is

06:19.465 --> 06:24.251
And I'm not implying some aliens that come and kidnapped me last night.

06:24.731 --> 06:32.580
I think it's really oddly pragmatic, but I can't describe it.

06:32.600 --> 06:38.888
I can't go with mystical, because I don't know what that means, and the associations to that word are so bad that I'm afraid of the word.

06:39.328 --> 06:44.374
You know, you said earlier, well, I didn't go to college.

06:45.415 --> 06:46.677
Neither did Lincoln, by the way.

06:46.997 --> 06:47.818
I did one year of school.

06:48.052 --> 06:54.199
You know, when I hear the measure is whether or not you've got a college degree, whether or not you, you know, Goebbels had a PhD.

06:54.619 --> 06:55.440
Just remember that.

06:55.741 --> 06:56.021
True.

06:56.481 --> 06:57.603
I will.

06:57.703 --> 07:02.508
And Lincoln only had one year of schooling, so... I know, it's all very arbitrary.

07:02.688 --> 07:05.832
So... But we live in a very competitive culture.

07:07.714 --> 07:13.941
I remember when I was going, when I finally did go to the arts students to calm my father down, there was this hierarchy between

07:15.288 --> 07:26.482
real artists who died young and cut their ear off an emulation of Van Gogh, and us commercial whores who did illustration for Esquire and books.

07:27.083 --> 07:34.332
There's always been that division between fine art and commercial art, between the artist or the educated person.

07:34.352 --> 07:35.294
It's class division.

07:35.995 --> 07:40.160
It's easier in England where everybody despises each other for being class divided.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.802
The upstairs-downstairs division

07:41.933 --> 07:44.276
In this country, we pretend there is no such division.

07:44.296 --> 07:45.458
There are endless divisions.

07:46.139 --> 07:47.300
And we all know what they are.

07:47.340 --> 07:48.482
We all know our place.

07:49.463 --> 08:04.382
And only through a great effort can we break through these invisible divisions and take on Shakespeare or take on Keats or take on... And then when I went to Berkeley, I was so impressed that they accepted me.

08:04.563 --> 08:07.206
It's pathetic to hear myself say that.

08:07.827 --> 08:10.030
Because they all esteemed me as an artist.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.772
But they respected my mind.

08:12.224 --> 08:22.314
Everything they had to say about Melville and Shakespeare, they took seriously, and some little part of them would say, holy malogy, these guys, these giants, these intellects, these professors.

08:22.594 --> 08:28.579
Let me tell you what the woman, the managing editor of Smithsonian, said when I teased her with your name.

08:29.701 --> 08:37.148
She said, anything as Sendak, she said, I hate to use this phrase, she said, but in my estimation, we're talking about a living legend.

08:37.528 --> 08:41.792
You know, a person who I believe is even transcended

08:41.941 --> 08:46.885
You know, I don't mean to lay this on like this, but I'm telling you, I'm a journalist.

08:46.945 --> 08:51.469
I'm reporting what somebody says, and I happen to share the sentiment.

08:51.550 --> 08:56.154
I mean, I can't tell you how really delighted I am to be here.

08:56.174 --> 09:02.799
What I really would like to do is go home, transcribe this tape, study it, and maybe let's do a part two.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.920
Can we do a part two?

09:03.961 --> 09:06.843
No, let's do a part two, which is really important to me.

09:07.424 --> 09:08.124
And we'll do it right.

09:08.144 --> 09:10.166
I'm asking you more than you're asking me.

09:10.286 --> 09:11.307
I need your input.

09:12.147 --> 09:13.668
You've got connections.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.771
Well, I'll do everything I can if you don't let me come back.

09:16.791 --> 09:17.952
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:18.413 --> 09:18.733
I'd like to.

09:19.073 --> 09:20.595
That's why I wanted to make that trip.

09:20.615 --> 09:22.136
And I'm going to see Helen Vendler in about a month.

09:22.276 --> 09:32.266
Maybe we can, you know, maybe we'll shut out the tape recorder and you can give me an idea of the kinds of things you want me to look for.

09:32.326 --> 09:32.626
Yeah.

09:32.646 --> 09:35.208
I mean, some Keats books are, well, let's not do it now.

09:35.228 --> 09:35.509
Okay.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.970
We should do what you need now.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.032
I think we're in good shape.

09:39.350 --> 09:42.955
We mentioned the books, the kinds of things you've done to get close to what it is.

09:43.696 --> 09:46.841
Again, I was driving at something we talked about.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.763
You don't have the university education.

09:48.803 --> 09:53.670
We're talking about George Bernard Shaw, who was totally a product of what he read in the British Library.

09:54.191 --> 09:57.255
Virginia Woolf was totally uneducated.

09:57.836 --> 10:02.342
Everything she, the new biography, she's totally a product of her reading.

10:02.463 --> 10:06.268
If you read her journal, she gets pissed off when life intrudes on her reading.

10:06.552 --> 10:12.262
I was just reading a little book on Proust that just came out about everything you can learn from reading Proust.

10:12.282 --> 10:13.624
It's a sort of smart-ass book.

10:13.744 --> 10:15.087
It's clever.

10:15.207 --> 10:15.988
Oh, I know the book.

10:16.008 --> 10:17.130
Yeah, I read it right over there.

10:17.150 --> 10:17.911
I have it, yeah.

10:17.931 --> 10:23.281
But what's touching is just that, because he quotes from her journal on reading Proust.

10:23.301 --> 10:24.102
She can't stand it.

10:25.464 --> 10:26.145
It's done.

10:26.266 --> 10:27.468
It's done, she felt it.

10:27.768 --> 10:28.830
What am I going to do?

10:29.047 --> 10:34.211
What tiny little voice do I have compared to this great... She knew immediately she was reading a great genius.

10:34.732 --> 10:36.313
And she took it very personally.

10:36.793 --> 10:38.115
She was very competitive.

10:38.295 --> 10:51.586
We all take it very personally, but I think, actually, without being hyperbolic, or at least attempting not to be hyperbolic, that gives me the greatest joy.

10:51.806 --> 10:53.568
I don't feel the competition.

10:53.648 --> 10:56.890
I don't feel... How can anybody compete with these people?

10:56.990 --> 10:57.751
I mean, forget it.

10:57.851 --> 10:58.952
Why even think about it?

10:59.658 --> 11:06.167
And you know what worries me about not being able to use visionary, what's the word we couldn't deal with, spiritual?

11:06.247 --> 11:07.129
Look at William Blake.

11:07.809 --> 11:08.911
He used the word all the time.

11:09.692 --> 11:13.257
And he was a hard-ass man.

11:13.277 --> 11:16.422
He really was of this earth.

11:16.542 --> 11:21.869
I mean, he is some respectable person, respectable person.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.935
So when he can use phrases like that and dream visionary things,

11:26.422 --> 11:36.071
I'm very curious about what all that is and how you can use that language seriously without sounding like a pompous asshole.

11:37.052 --> 11:38.053
And see, Blake did it.

11:40.476 --> 11:53.408
And when Keats talks about soul-making, those letters to George, his brother George in Kentucky, and his sister-in-law Georgiana, the two Georges, and he talks about soul-making and how

11:53.928 --> 12:23.513
brain and the heart work together to create the spirit it's not religious because he was vehemently agnostic and anti-church so this is the artist talking about the soul and the spirit and Blake did and you have to begin to take it seriously like hey what are they saying that you could use that is your old skepticism is getting in your own way because you're afraid to think in these

12:23.763 --> 12:25.425
large and generous terms.

12:25.826 --> 12:26.687
Keats wasn't afraid.

12:27.408 --> 12:31.695
He was the least fettered artist almost that I know of.

12:32.175 --> 12:40.147
His sexuality is bursting grapes against his tongue, the way he uses his mouth, the way he uses his palate, the way he uses his body.

12:41.489 --> 12:42.210
The eat of St.

12:42.330 --> 12:45.835
Agnes, the way she gets fucked is so incredibly hot.

12:47.518 --> 12:52.605
This was a passionate, vivid human being.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.581
It is wonderful.

12:54.601 --> 12:54.961
It is wonderful.

12:54.981 --> 13:02.088
You know, Blake, you think of Blake, it seems to me that you immerse yourself in these texts, the way he immerses himself.

13:02.248 --> 13:06.551
He couldn't do Dante unless he, he couldn't read a translation of Dante.

13:07.632 --> 13:13.377
I mean, the way you're going to Shakespeare, the way you're going to Keats, it seems to me that's the way Blake had to go to Dante.

13:13.397 --> 13:15.259
Well, except he was blanking on me.

13:15.599 --> 13:17.261
I'm making comparisons.

13:17.341 --> 13:19.062
No, but he went with visions.

13:19.322 --> 13:20.724
He went with visions.

13:20.744 --> 13:22.305
It was a wonderful exhibition that

13:23.112 --> 13:26.057
Yale, The Mellon, a month ago.

13:27.078 --> 13:29.422
All their blakes, unbelievable.

13:30.383 --> 13:33.989
It was such a renewal for me to just see it again and feel it again.

13:34.009 --> 13:38.416
Do you still love pop-up books, by the way?

13:39.698 --> 13:40.219
Not as much.

13:41.902 --> 13:47.871
I think what's happening unwittingly is trailing away from publishing.

13:49.049 --> 13:51.592
Because it's... And we haven't even talked about what you're doing.

13:51.612 --> 13:53.315
I know, because this will be part two, I think.

13:53.335 --> 13:54.096
Yeah, I'm so depressed.

13:54.216 --> 13:57.861
We have to get into the music and the operas and the ballets and this kind of stuff.

13:57.881 --> 14:17.166
I mean, Jim has hooked me back into publishing because of the anniversary, but also I'm about to illustrate a book by James Marshall, which when I was with him as often as I could while he was in the dying process, he talked about the owl and the pussycat, but she had always had rough watercolors for Richard Gregg.

14:17.905 --> 14:19.407
And he wondered, could they be published?

14:19.467 --> 14:20.688
Of course they could be published.

14:20.828 --> 14:29.639
Now Harper's, I've been supervising the printing of it and the mechanics of it, doing everything he would have done, hoping I'm doing as well as he wants to.

14:30.520 --> 14:36.547
Then he left a manuscript at his death, which is absolutely written for his own particular talent.

14:36.567 --> 14:37.488
I'm illustrating it.

14:38.649 --> 14:42.073
My book, On the Table, I'm not worried about comparisons.

14:42.293 --> 14:46.258
I know Jim would do this better because he wrote for himself, as I write for myself.

14:46.542 --> 14:47.343
But he can't do it.

14:47.363 --> 14:47.663
He's dead.

14:47.703 --> 14:51.286
So how do I... What do I need to know about Jim, by the way, that I don't know?

14:51.366 --> 14:53.909
I mean, these two things I don't even know about now.

14:53.949 --> 14:55.050
These are projects and work.

14:55.070 --> 14:58.813
Well, the book at Harpers is called Swine Lake.

14:58.833 --> 14:59.574
Swine Lake.

14:59.594 --> 15:08.402
A hilarious takeoff on ballet people in his most sardonic wit.

15:08.983 --> 15:10.444
It's a hilarious book to illustrate.

15:10.644 --> 15:14.608
And it'll be fun, except it'll make me miss him every day more.

15:14.926 --> 15:16.028
But what else can I tell you?

15:16.328 --> 15:17.350
The Owl and the Pussycat.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.856
I wrote a tiny little piece for that.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.101
So I am going to do a book.

15:25.083 --> 15:34.199
I mean, I'm going to have to put aside all my Shakespeare, Keats, whatever that is, over here for a while and tend to swine like.

15:34.479 --> 15:36.883
This is kind of something you're doing for a

15:37.437 --> 15:39.500
Yeah, for Buddy.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.602
And how did you get to know him, by the way?

15:41.622 --> 15:42.924
I mean, did he write you?

15:43.004 --> 15:47.169
No, I remember exactly the occasion.

15:47.189 --> 15:48.751
I remember exactly the occasion.

15:48.771 --> 15:50.954
I don't remember the year, but you can check on the year.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.217
Maybe in the 60s or 70s.

15:54.439 --> 15:57.663
Margot Zemach, who was a great illustrator.

15:57.683 --> 15:58.724
You know her work.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.027
She was a wonderful friend.

16:01.648 --> 16:04.151
Harv Zemach, her husband was a wonderful friend.

16:04.231 --> 16:04.972
He died.

16:06.073 --> 16:07.275
And then Margot won

16:07.610 --> 16:09.713
miraculously, she won the Colicotta Award.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.675
And I believe it was in San Francisco.

16:12.897 --> 16:14.499
And I was so happy for her.

16:14.539 --> 16:19.005
I mean, this was a tortured lady, and she so deserved it.

16:19.105 --> 16:20.928
And she's one of those Jim Marshall people.

16:21.008 --> 16:25.534
She definitely is in that same class with Jim, the divacity of the work.

16:25.754 --> 16:27.697
No one was like Margot.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.299
No one was like Margot.

16:29.319 --> 16:33.845
And she deserves exactly what Jim is getting now, posthumously.

16:33.865 --> 16:36.148
She deserves somebody to reconsider her

16:36.432 --> 16:40.819
and figure out how come this fantastic woman has been forgotten.

16:41.720 --> 17:01.391
Anyway, it was at her Call to Cut Award party, and I believe it was San Francisco, and I was sitting at a table, and this guy came over with this sardonic sort of Free Musketeers flourish up like that, and it was Jim.

17:01.411 --> 17:01.972
That's nice.

17:01.992 --> 17:03.335
And he was very young.

17:03.395 --> 17:04.296
He was...

17:04.664 --> 17:12.392
Maybe, I'm 69, he died, I think he was 50, so I'm 19 years older, 18 years older when he died.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.794
He was about my age.

17:13.814 --> 17:14.274
Yeah.

17:15.876 --> 17:18.359
And great fan of my books.

17:18.939 --> 17:24.145
I did not know his stuff except I knew his name, and I quickly invested in looking at his stuff.

17:24.845 --> 17:28.089
It was one of those rare things where you can like the person and like the work.

17:28.109 --> 17:29.611
How many times did that happen?

17:29.631 --> 17:30.992
But you don't have to flub.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.836
You know, I showed him my stuff.

17:33.896 --> 17:37.041
He was so candid, I want to break his mouth once in a while.

17:37.562 --> 17:38.464
And I was the same with him.

17:38.524 --> 17:45.094
We were very, very clear with each other about respecting each other's work and veracities and all of that.

17:45.535 --> 17:48.079
We got to be good friends right there at Marco's party.

17:48.099 --> 17:58.836
And he was like Arnold Lobel, like some of the younger people, generation younger than me, who were really great, and Margot Zemach.

18:00.031 --> 18:06.559
Not exactly I wasn't old enough truly to be mentors to them, but a little bit.

18:06.579 --> 18:07.199
A little bit.

18:07.860 --> 18:15.429
I was giving them what Crockett Johnson and Ruth Krauss had given to me, which was an enormous kind of encouragement and talking.

18:17.251 --> 18:21.336
See, what I miss most is I have nobody to mentor.

18:21.356 --> 18:23.618
You know, they don't get to me, really.

18:23.659 --> 18:28.384
I'm far away from the whole business of publishing.

18:29.107 --> 18:31.350
A lot of people think I'm croaked.

18:31.370 --> 18:32.912
You're doing other things now, too.

18:32.932 --> 18:33.753
Yeah, and I used to teach.

18:33.834 --> 18:34.675
I love teaching.

18:34.795 --> 18:38.680
I was teaching at Yale, and then I taught these Parsons.

18:38.781 --> 18:43.727
It was fun, and I had to give it up because it interrupted the work, and then operas and designing for the state.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.530
I was 10 years doing that.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.334
But I really, it's in my blood.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.938
See, I have a children's theater, which we haven't even talked about.

18:51.378 --> 18:51.839
Next time.

18:52.019 --> 18:52.440
Next time.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.502
But that's the place where I'm mentoring.

18:54.803 --> 18:56.165
Okay, children's theater.

18:56.185 --> 18:57.747
I'm going to write this down.

18:58.655 --> 19:00.938
Actually, you say you've got somebody coming like now, right?

19:01.078 --> 19:02.960
He'll show up any moment.

19:03.321 --> 19:03.641
Okay.

19:03.661 --> 19:05.123
Well, let's just keep that going.

19:05.183 --> 19:05.764
He won't mind.

19:05.804 --> 19:07.466
He'll come in and sit for a minute.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.006
Don't matter.

19:08.026 --> 19:09.828
Would you sign a couple of books for me?

19:09.848 --> 19:12.952
I'm sorry to cut off.

19:12.972 --> 19:13.353
No, no, no.

19:13.373 --> 19:14.554
Do you want me to give you a call?

19:14.594 --> 19:16.016
Do I have a call instead of that?

19:16.036 --> 19:16.136
Yeah.

19:16.296 --> 19:17.117
And when's good for you?

19:18.359 --> 19:21.102
Probably the latter part of this month.

19:21.200 --> 19:21.661
Okay.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.603
Or better, early September.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.524
That would be good.

19:24.544 --> 19:29.749
Because then all of October, I'm going, I'll be in Houston because the hospital is opening.

19:30.150 --> 19:33.273
And so I'll be there for the production.

19:33.293 --> 19:34.315
Please, could you?

19:35.015 --> 19:37.398
Maybe get a wife because I want to autograph this.

19:38.279 --> 19:38.820
You know what?

19:39.420 --> 19:41.803
Well, why not?

19:42.203 --> 19:43.144
You don't mind doing it.

19:43.164 --> 19:45.547
No, of course not.

19:45.968 --> 19:49.131
Do you have a catalog that...

19:50.022 --> 19:51.464
Rosenback did on Dracula?

19:51.905 --> 19:52.986
I bought it.

19:53.266 --> 19:53.707
Okay.

19:53.727 --> 19:54.128
I bought it.

19:54.448 --> 19:57.232
I just came in.

19:57.312 --> 19:59.615
Thank you.

19:59.635 --> 20:00.236
I should have brought it.

20:00.256 --> 20:00.817
I'll bring it down.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.421
Yeah, we'll do it the next time.

20:03.641 --> 20:05.223
As you can see.

20:07.086 --> 20:07.526
That's all right.

20:07.546 --> 20:08.127
Take them out.

20:08.508 --> 20:08.988
You don't mind?

20:09.028 --> 20:09.209
No.

20:10.931 --> 20:13.935
I just want to get a better pen.

20:13.955 --> 20:14.736
This is a good one.

20:14.756 --> 20:15.257
How about that?

20:15.638 --> 20:16.719
Oh, that's even better.

20:16.979 --> 20:18.882
Hi.

20:19.587 --> 20:20.368
This is Ivan.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.590
Oh, Ivan.

20:21.730 --> 20:23.192
Brad Payne.

20:23.653 --> 20:24.074
Hi, Lloyd.

20:24.214 --> 20:24.875
Nice to meet you.

20:24.895 --> 20:25.436
Scott's here?

20:25.536 --> 20:25.836
Yeah.

20:25.856 --> 20:26.457
Is he with you?

20:26.477 --> 20:27.639
Yes, he'll wait.

20:27.659 --> 20:34.609
Tell him I'll be done in a very short time.

20:34.629 --> 20:35.090
Great.

20:35.110 --> 20:35.591
Okay.

20:36.853 --> 20:39.377
Point out that nursery rhymes were not written for children.

20:39.417 --> 20:39.937
Never were.

20:40.118 --> 20:42.541
They were political salaries.

20:42.702 --> 20:46.307
So you talk about the quality books.

20:46.327 --> 20:47.829
How beautiful this book is.

20:47.869 --> 20:48.530
Look at that.

20:48.550 --> 20:49.071
It's beautiful.

20:49.996 --> 20:50.778
Sinful.

20:50.898 --> 20:52.181
It's like a box of chocolates.

20:53.845 --> 20:56.752
My girls are Nicole and I see Barbara first.

20:56.772 --> 20:57.374
She's the older.

20:58.196 --> 21:01.884
Barbara and Nicole.

21:01.904 --> 21:08.460
Each of my girls, by the way, has a signed Sendak poster in their rooms, which I don't remember, but I was in a line at

21:08.896 --> 21:11.439
an AVA out in California, got in line twice.

21:11.460 --> 21:14.323
You were doing one HarperCollins 1 and one FSG.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.908
I remember that occasion, but I can't remember what it was.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.911
You said to me, you're very persistent.

21:19.931 --> 21:21.453
I said, I am indeed.

21:22.495 --> 21:25.198
Vangely rings a bell, because I wanted both.

21:25.579 --> 21:29.224
And I went right along, right back, and I was afraid I was going to get the other one.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.447
Is it M-I-C-O-L-E?

21:35.773 --> 21:36.274
Yeah.

21:36.314 --> 21:36.914
That's funny.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.076
But that...

21:38.849 --> 21:42.392
You know, the nursery rhymes were developed.

21:43.013 --> 21:44.914
There were political salaries.

21:44.994 --> 21:49.458
There were jokes on the Queen of England, the Scottish Queen.

21:50.499 --> 21:53.362
And then when they lost their political meaning, they were like haiku.

21:53.382 --> 21:54.463
Nobody knew what they meant.

21:54.543 --> 21:55.904
So let's give it to the kids.

21:55.964 --> 21:57.486
They'll make something out of it.

21:59.627 --> 22:00.368
It's like Grimm.

22:00.408 --> 22:01.369
Never meant for the kids.

22:01.389 --> 22:03.010
The two brothers were mortified.

22:03.811 --> 22:08.215
The kids were reading their august tomes.

22:09.697 --> 22:12.800
Boy, that Dear Millie was quite an experience, wasn't it?

22:12.840 --> 22:13.161
Quite.

22:13.181 --> 22:14.222
That was a good being.

22:14.762 --> 22:16.084
That was a hard book.

22:16.104 --> 22:16.784
Yeah.

22:16.804 --> 22:17.985
Then these are just for me.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.927
I want to spell your nut.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.769
It's Nicholas, like regular Nicholas.

22:21.789 --> 22:25.873
Yeah, it's my Nicholas.

22:25.893 --> 22:28.156
Oh, you're wonderful.

22:28.176 --> 22:28.556
Yeah, that's great.

22:28.576 --> 22:29.377
I love this book.

22:31.339 --> 22:32.400
They do nice things.

22:32.640 --> 22:33.361
Candlewood.

22:33.381 --> 22:34.302
Yep.

22:35.964 --> 22:36.244
Yep.

22:38.266 --> 22:40.469
Oh, it's fine, though.

22:40.489 --> 22:40.970
That's fine.

22:45.177 --> 22:45.577
Why not?

22:47.080 --> 22:50.405
Nick is fine, too, actually.

22:50.425 --> 22:51.086
Good handwriting.

22:51.386 --> 22:53.830
I'm going to write the same thing because I mean the same thing.

22:53.930 --> 22:54.511
That's fine.

22:56.014 --> 22:57.135
And I know you've got somebody else.

22:57.155 --> 22:58.037
You can just sign these.

23:01.102 --> 23:02.063
Put them in my hand.

23:03.224 --> 23:05.667
This means a lot to me, this catalog, actually.

23:05.887 --> 23:07.329
This is... It's a pretty catalog.

23:07.389 --> 23:10.533
But it's kind of what I... I would hold it open for a moment.

23:10.553 --> 23:10.713
Yeah.

23:11.714 --> 23:14.518
But it has meaning for me, you know, for very specific.

23:14.638 --> 23:16.801
It's your collection and it's your books.

23:17.141 --> 23:21.306
And you'll see when you get into my book how much I owe to the Rosenbach, by the way.

23:21.326 --> 23:23.028
Oh, well, that's a whole other conversation.

23:23.048 --> 23:30.297
Well, that's, you know, all my letters from Rosenbach and Huntington and the Shiteys, and I spent a week doing research down there.

23:31.659 --> 23:32.159
Great place.

23:32.179 --> 23:32.860
Oh, it's...

23:33.869 --> 23:36.833
I think you're – I will put this on, actually.

23:37.073 --> 23:40.938
Now, are they – is that the repository for your stuff?

23:43.001 --> 23:43.221
Yeah, yep.

23:43.301 --> 23:47.306
That's kind of – Yeah, there's all things related to my books, Spanish books go there.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.648
And why is that?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.991
Why not Harvard, Yale, or some such place?

23:51.011 --> 23:52.833
Well, it's because I like it.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.476
I like the smallness of it.

23:55.496 --> 23:57.699
I like the fact that the pictures are available.

23:58.280 --> 24:03.066
Some of the universities take things, and they put them in vaults, and it's like burying them alive.

24:03.687 --> 24:04.948
Tell me what the good of that is.

24:05.609 --> 24:09.453
The Rosenbach will have little exhibitions.

24:09.713 --> 24:10.774
You can make appointments.

24:10.795 --> 24:11.816
You can go up and see.

24:12.096 --> 24:13.137
Students can look at the pictures.

24:13.798 --> 24:15.179
So they're alive.

24:15.399 --> 24:16.080
They stay alive.

24:16.100 --> 24:16.981
They take care of them.

24:17.381 --> 24:18.583
They take care of all my babies.

24:18.983 --> 24:20.825
I can't take care of them.

24:21.186 --> 24:21.486
That's great.

24:21.506 --> 24:23.248
You can just sign this if you want.

24:23.288 --> 24:24.069
There's somebody here.

24:24.949 --> 24:25.270
That's right.

24:25.290 --> 24:26.451
This is your last one, right?

24:26.471 --> 24:27.372
That's it.

24:27.772 --> 24:31.036
I think I can take the time to put your name on.

24:31.056 --> 24:32.057
Kind of, kind of.

24:32.290 --> 24:36.436
So you'd say that September would be better than August?

24:36.616 --> 24:39.661
I would check in towards the end of August, see how things are going.

24:39.681 --> 24:39.781
Okay.

24:40.762 --> 24:41.323
That would be good.

24:44.347 --> 24:47.572
I'm going up to San Francisco next month, going to Italy.

24:47.892 --> 24:49.054
Whose house do you want to be?

24:49.074 --> 24:49.515
Keith's house.

24:49.815 --> 24:51.137
Yeah, what else?

24:51.297 --> 24:54.662
And I want to go to the house he died in on top of the Spanish steps in Rome.

24:55.163 --> 24:58.267
I want to go to the Protestant cemetery where he's buried in Rome.

24:59.209 --> 25:00.030
And I want to see Rome.

25:00.350 --> 25:01.572
And I want to eat a type of food.

25:01.855 --> 25:03.257
and they want to die in Italy.

25:03.277 --> 25:04.659
That's really what I want to do.

25:04.679 --> 25:07.364
But this is all really for this project.

25:08.766 --> 25:09.046
Yeah.

25:09.687 --> 25:10.829
No, it's for you.

25:10.929 --> 25:16.157
It's desperately for me, because I have not been in Europe for so long, and I miss it terribly.

25:16.558 --> 25:22.707
And I really, if I have to be totally honest, it is Italy I miss terribly.

25:22.727 --> 25:25.632
I'm going to go see Father Boyle at the Vatican Library.

25:25.692 --> 25:29.618
I'm going to go to the Medici Library.

25:30.121 --> 25:31.184
And I feel the same way.

25:31.344 --> 25:34.994
I cannot write about these places unless I go... I'm going to smell them and be there.

25:35.014 --> 25:38.623
I'm going to open at Pergamum in Asia Minor, which is the oldest library.

25:38.884 --> 25:39.806
It's still there.

25:41.110 --> 25:41.912
Isn't it today?

25:41.932 --> 25:42.072
Yes.
