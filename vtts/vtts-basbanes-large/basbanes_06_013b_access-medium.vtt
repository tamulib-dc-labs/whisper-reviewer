WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:07.727
This is what you're talking about.

00:08.148 --> 00:09.469
STC was, yes.

00:11.612 --> 00:16.457
There was no nonsense with Wing, but still, he was very different.

00:18.139 --> 00:18.819
He was very different.

00:18.839 --> 00:20.381
He was a snob lover.

00:20.401 --> 00:23.184
Do you know Roger's son at all?

00:23.564 --> 00:24.806
Roger's helped me a lot.

00:24.826 --> 00:26.848
He's very nice and very helpful.

00:27.268 --> 00:28.890
He's very wonderful.

00:29.933 --> 00:32.876
posed a Socratic kind of a question to me.

00:34.098 --> 00:40.325
He said, I'd be interested in knowing not why people start collecting, because there are any number of reasons for that.

00:40.345 --> 00:44.410
He said, but I'd be just as interested in knowing why some people stop collecting.

00:44.430 --> 00:44.730
Stop?

00:45.150 --> 00:45.491
Stop.

00:45.831 --> 00:53.019
He didn't say Arthur Colton, but I think he was probably thinking of him, you know, I wonder why somebody like Colton all the time.

00:53.060 --> 00:57.004
I think probably the reasons are much less interesting in why they start collecting.

00:58.452 --> 01:03.159
You stopped collecting, I suppose, because you're weary and old.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.146
You don't have room for your books?

01:08.166 --> 01:08.807
What did you say?

01:09.328 --> 01:18.001
Your wife says, I'm going in for diamonds if you go in for books.

01:18.061 --> 01:21.386
Trish and Bob did tell me an interesting story.

01:21.706 --> 01:27.615
He didn't want to name the guy, but the guy came into his office and said, my wife said if he was

01:27.983 --> 01:57.282
me of the books yeah and so he claims to found a home for them at one of the universities in new york and but i guess the guy also wanted to make sure that the books stayed together as a collection like that that happens doesn't it i guess when a lot of people look at jerome kern there's a great there's a great example he had a wonderful collection but i think he kind of knew maybe he maybe he knew that the crash was coming he also sold all his stock

01:58.392 --> 01:59.213
You can keep it out.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.334
You can keep it out at the right time.

02:00.434 --> 02:05.339
But I guess for a lot of people, also, the acquisition is a big kick.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.340
That's it, I think.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.482
Getting the things... I think it's an acquisition.

02:09.483 --> 02:11.485
And these people aren't you collecting.

02:11.505 --> 02:12.946
Well, they love stamps of books.

02:12.986 --> 02:15.729
They really do.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.631
That I have every shape to be a full year.

02:18.651 --> 02:20.433
That's my accomplishment.

02:20.453 --> 02:23.516
The state is to, why do you buy things?

02:24.737 --> 02:25.598
Well, to look at.

02:25.932 --> 02:36.669
If we talk about the extraordinary prices that are now being paid for books, but when you think about it, now that we talk about the garden sale, for instance, in November, I'm doing quite a bit of research on Mr. Haven.

02:36.689 --> 02:37.550
Have you ever said anything?

02:37.971 --> 02:42.358
We know that, and we didn't sell to more of it.

02:42.478 --> 02:44.721
That's a fascinating story.

02:44.741 --> 02:49.869
That's a fascinating story, which I've been working on.

02:49.889 --> 02:53.475
Whether or not it'll get in my book, everything I know,

02:53.742 --> 03:00.309
Because, again, you have to decide that we still have to focus on book collecting, you know.

03:00.329 --> 03:03.212
That might be an article that I write.

03:03.232 --> 03:08.857
You know who... I don't suppose you have spoken with Marvin Mondland?

03:08.877 --> 03:09.918
Marvin, I know.

03:09.958 --> 03:10.499
You do know?

03:10.639 --> 03:10.819
Yeah.

03:11.780 --> 03:15.664
Because he's doing a book on the Fourth Avenue deal with news.

03:15.744 --> 03:17.106
I think that's a nice idea.

03:18.167 --> 03:18.547
Very nice.

03:18.567 --> 03:20.349
In fact, I've given him some books.

03:20.369 --> 03:22.551
See, I sold my book on the structural proposal.

03:23.408 --> 03:28.233
and he's trying to write the whole book and sell the book, and I said, I love it.

03:28.253 --> 03:30.755
I know, we should try and, you know.

03:33.938 --> 03:37.441
I feel very secure with the knowledge that I have a contract.

03:37.741 --> 03:38.122
Of course.

03:38.162 --> 03:39.503
And that I haven't had any hands.

03:39.523 --> 03:40.064
Of course.

03:40.344 --> 03:44.107
And that I know that my enemies... I've told him that too.

03:44.127 --> 03:46.890
You know, but otherwise you're working on speculation.

03:46.910 --> 03:48.291
I think he's scared that he won't.

03:48.391 --> 03:49.633
I think he is.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.154
I think he is, but I like...

03:51.775 --> 03:52.556
The idea.

03:52.576 --> 03:53.738
The idea is excellent.

03:53.779 --> 03:54.540
Excellent.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.203
And he's really working at it.

03:56.223 --> 03:57.705
He's interviewed many people.

03:58.286 --> 04:01.993
There comes a point where you really have to... Like, I'm at that point now.

04:02.394 --> 04:03.636
I'm at that point.

04:03.716 --> 04:06.962
I started the research in earnest in November.

04:07.002 --> 04:07.623
That's not so.

04:07.643 --> 04:10.949
That's six months of really major research.

04:11.009 --> 04:11.810
I've been to Texas.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.936
God knows how many times I've been to Boston and Harvard and Cambridge.

04:15.457 --> 04:16.298
And I am kind of...

04:17.493 --> 04:21.378
The circle, I started out here, and I'm kind of coming in closer to home.

04:21.418 --> 04:22.740
That's why I haven't done the Beinecke yet.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.063
It's only an hour and a half from me, and I haven't done the J.C.

04:25.123 --> 04:27.947
Brown yet, because that's 45 minutes.

04:28.488 --> 04:30.130
But those are very interesting stories.

04:31.833 --> 04:33.375
The Brown story.

04:33.495 --> 04:39.964
That's an instance of generational collecting, as is Scheide, isn't it, right?

04:39.984 --> 04:41.166
Yeah, it was the young, the Scheide.

04:41.246 --> 04:42.848
Well, he's the third generation.

04:43.168 --> 04:43.789
How many?

04:43.809 --> 04:45.171
He's the third generation.

04:45.708 --> 04:52.399
And what is very interesting is that he won't really say what's going to happen to the collection, you know.

04:52.419 --> 04:53.300
He has children.

04:54.402 --> 04:59.289
However, if you have to think of inheritance now and taxes and stuff.

04:59.410 --> 05:02.314
Of course, I didn't provide for the collection.

05:02.334 --> 05:03.256
Did he in his will?

05:04.618 --> 05:06.040
That was the trouble.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.582
That was the trouble, I think.

05:07.622 --> 05:08.003
Yeah, you're right.

05:08.287 --> 05:16.846
But with Scheide's, Scheide's is a really fascinating case in that it is physically on the campus of Princeton University.

05:16.946 --> 05:19.973
He has a room which is really not much larger than this room.

05:20.314 --> 05:22.559
He really has 3,000 bodies.

05:23.401 --> 05:26.768
It's not a muscular collection in terms of what it is.

05:27.423 --> 05:37.955
Did you take a look at Marian Holden's library one year at Princeton?

05:38.195 --> 05:39.857
Is that right?

05:40.477 --> 05:41.739
Is that right?

05:42.019 --> 05:46.304
I'm going back to Princeton.

05:46.324 --> 05:51.169
The rare books are not in the Holden room, but the

05:51.638 --> 05:53.100
More ordinary stuff.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.261
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:54.281 --> 05:54.821
Steve Ferguson.

05:54.982 --> 05:56.443
Steve Ferguson.

05:56.463 --> 05:58.125
I wanted to talk to him.

05:58.145 --> 05:59.667
It helped me a lot.

05:59.687 --> 06:00.287
You gave me some ideas.

06:00.648 --> 06:01.408
How about collectors?

06:01.428 --> 06:04.332
Do you think that I'm, does it sound like I'm talking to the right people?

06:04.612 --> 06:05.773
I think so.

06:05.893 --> 06:06.214
I did.

06:06.554 --> 06:09.037
Ed Wolfe did offer without asking.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.820
He said he thought that they were the greatest living collector.

06:13.101 --> 06:14.843
They were shiny.

06:14.863 --> 06:18.427
After Freeman Fields and his Lady Eccles, Mary Hyde.

06:19.388 --> 06:20.389
Mary Hyde.

06:20.409 --> 06:21.510
Well, in his field.

06:21.912 --> 06:29.300
She is, oh my God, she's a benefactress.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.483
You go into the morgan and her name is there.

06:32.503 --> 06:34.645
You go to the Bodleian and I hate this thing.

06:34.665 --> 06:37.048
You go to Yale and Hartford.

06:37.068 --> 06:39.110
We visited their home.

06:39.631 --> 06:41.633
They lived in New Jersey.

06:42.173 --> 06:42.714
Four Oaks.

06:42.774 --> 06:44.015
Four Oaks.

06:44.315 --> 06:44.596
Four Oaks.

06:44.616 --> 06:45.777
Some of them.

06:45.993 --> 06:49.196
I've talked to her, I've talked with the Grosje Club.

06:49.216 --> 06:50.738
I've been really going everywhere.

06:50.778 --> 06:56.003
I've been going to the auctions, I've been going... And that's the only way to do it, as usual.

06:56.023 --> 06:57.964
I mean, you have to go out and do your work.

06:58.705 --> 07:00.607
And I feel now I have a mess.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.490
My wife says, what are you going to do?

07:03.530 --> 07:05.411
Have you got an organization?

07:05.492 --> 07:06.693
Yeah, it's so clear.

07:06.753 --> 07:09.716
You're both writers, so you know.

07:09.736 --> 07:14.380
I mean, it's... I feel just...

07:15.035 --> 07:17.538
I have, yeah.

07:18.599 --> 07:23.305
But only to use as counterpoint to the productive stuff.

07:23.325 --> 07:25.027
That in itself is a book.

07:25.168 --> 07:26.209
Yeah.

07:26.890 --> 07:27.711
But I have to focus.

07:27.731 --> 07:30.334
Now, you've heard of the incident out in Iowa.

07:30.354 --> 07:31.095
Yes, you did.

07:31.115 --> 07:33.238
Well, I've been getting everything on that.

07:33.258 --> 07:35.160
In fact, I've talked to a doctor.

07:36.261 --> 07:37.523
He's a school over.

07:37.543 --> 07:38.925
He's at Iowa State University.

07:38.945 --> 07:39.225
Yes.

07:39.505 --> 07:41.548
He's the one the FBI called in.

07:41.866 --> 07:44.911
I've been in touch with him.

07:45.512 --> 07:45.973
Yeah.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.880
But that's been sad.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.304
But that's been written, though.

07:52.424 --> 07:53.947
And that's bizarre.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.489
I don't know what that's got to do with books.

07:55.870 --> 07:56.571
That's crime.

07:56.651 --> 08:04.004
This kid out in Iowa is fascinating because he was stealing books just to pay you.

08:04.024 --> 08:06.608
He was a bibliocleftalaniac, is what he was.

08:06.959 --> 08:12.805
He had been caught several times and had been allowed.

08:12.846 --> 08:19.052
He was actually caught with burglars.

08:19.493 --> 08:20.995
He might have traveled.

08:21.015 --> 08:22.817
He traveled all over the United States.

08:23.057 --> 08:33.068
And the reason he can't scoot over, I guess his name is, he said that the guy, what is really amazing is that he very carefully took the labels of every institution.

08:33.757 --> 08:34.678
that he stole from.

08:34.718 --> 08:35.840
He put them together.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.041
He had a ledger.

08:37.061 --> 08:38.643
It was like counting scalps.

08:38.663 --> 08:39.624
They belonged?

08:39.644 --> 08:40.105
Yeah.

08:40.165 --> 08:44.310
He has kept a very meticulous record of the people he robbed from.

08:44.650 --> 08:52.200
Maddie and I, oh God, about 15 years ago, lectured at Evansville, Indiana.

08:52.220 --> 08:57.326
And at the lecture was, at the lecture, was a young man.

08:58.207 --> 09:02.953
And a lady came up and said, would you like to visit his own life jersey poster?

09:03.473 --> 09:06.177
Maybe you could buy a few, but he'd like to show them to it.

09:07.059 --> 09:10.484
And a very not pleasant young man, and we went.

09:10.945 --> 09:19.998
And the sponsors of this lecture were just horrified because they said he was guilty of stealing books from the library.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.821
And he sort of fits in with this.

09:22.042 --> 09:23.243
He was a black sheet.

09:24.145 --> 09:27.490
And he had an awful lot of good books there.

09:27.689 --> 09:31.194
So you probably have been traveling around, you might be just saying.

09:31.214 --> 09:37.844
Well, my opening chapter, the introduction starts with the Alexandrian Library, of course.

09:37.864 --> 09:47.779
And the apocryphal visit, not the Caesar's visit to Alexandria certainly was an apocryphal, but his visit to the library where Cleopatra had said to have given him his choice in everything.

09:47.799 --> 09:53.207
And he took what he said to be 40,000 manuscripts, and he created them and put them in the wards.

09:53.828 --> 09:56.911
And then the fire started, and it was all destroyed.

09:57.211 --> 09:59.353
But no, the library itself wasn't destroyed.

09:59.373 --> 10:01.034
You see, Gibbon was wrong on that, too.

10:01.354 --> 10:06.779
It was really destroyed 900 years later by a Muslim named Omar Khalif.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.001
But it is instructive.

10:09.041 --> 10:13.345
I say there are people like Caesar who collect to acquire.

10:13.365 --> 10:18.169
And there are those who, like the keepers of the books, who collect to preserve the product of human body.

10:18.189 --> 10:19.290
Books are so fragile.

10:19.430 --> 10:20.231
They're so delicate.

10:20.491 --> 10:23.093
Well, when I was in England just two weeks ago,

10:23.647 --> 10:26.873
Well, I said books are so fragile, and you say they're not.

10:26.893 --> 10:27.293
That's interesting.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.197
They're not.

10:29.217 --> 10:36.510
You have a book from 1550, it says, Sturdy, and then a book printed in 1950.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.034
But that's one that survived.

10:39.054 --> 10:41.238
How many haven't?

10:41.258 --> 10:44.824
War, fire, neglect, plot.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.988
They didn't survive because of neglect.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.760
Look at the last wall.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.308
Look at what he's destroying the last wall, for heaven's sake.

10:57.570 --> 10:58.472
Oh, look at that.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.954
Oh, I guess it ran across the place.

11:00.014 --> 11:04.442
And then we're looking at... Look at that.

11:05.383 --> 11:08.048
Look at that.

11:09.007 --> 11:11.010
What is the title of this?

11:11.050 --> 11:14.154
You can say it to my machine.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.175
Is that 1586?

11:15.335 --> 11:17.438
Is that the cosmos?

11:17.598 --> 11:17.819
Yeah.

11:17.879 --> 11:21.003
The life of the cosmos.

11:21.023 --> 11:24.588
I mean, they are very sturdy.

11:24.648 --> 11:26.671
They're very sturdy.

11:26.691 --> 11:35.402
I'll tell you, who started finding the great early books, and probably the greatest bookseller of modern times in early books, was E.P.

11:35.422 --> 11:36.043
Goldschmidt.

11:36.361 --> 11:43.408
the establishment, not a successor, he would go to the monasteries.

11:44.189 --> 11:52.018
He went to the Austrian monasteries to milk, to monasteries in Salzburg, around, all to Austria.

11:52.538 --> 11:57.023
And the monks after the First World War, a little money wouldn't hurt.

11:57.784 --> 12:02.449
And they sold some of their greatest treasures, in Cannabula, to government.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.592
And that's how he established

12:05.842 --> 12:08.204
Great, great books in London.

12:08.224 --> 12:10.246
Do you still make your trips to England?

12:10.306 --> 12:10.686
No.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.188
We stopped two years ago.

12:12.208 --> 12:14.310
I wasn't well, and we didn't go.

12:14.850 --> 12:19.675
And we find going to Europe, if we're quick on the trigger, we get to get one.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.897
Press it immediately.

12:21.917 --> 12:22.717
And phone.

12:22.778 --> 12:24.859
Like the other day, I phoned to Germany.

12:25.260 --> 12:26.481
Got nine books.

12:26.501 --> 12:26.821
Wow.

12:27.142 --> 12:29.143
We phoned to London in the morning.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.485
We only wanted two.

12:30.505 --> 12:31.245
We got one.

12:31.325 --> 12:32.607
Well, all right.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.228
But it doesn't say we're getting

12:34.428 --> 12:42.819
You see, when you buy, when you're on the spot, say, say a Goldschmidt's today, you get to make up your mind quickly.

12:42.839 --> 12:44.220
You can't do a dally.

12:44.561 --> 12:46.624
You also have a very expensive hotel.

12:47.324 --> 12:50.689
So this way you can do the copyright very well.

12:50.769 --> 12:54.454
By the way, I should say for the record, you did take out the Aldine Medici here.

12:55.034 --> 12:56.456
That's what this book is.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.097
Is that right?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.038
Yeah.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.822
This book here, this is an Aldine.

13:00.842 --> 13:00.942
Yeah.

13:00.982 --> 13:01.903
This is one of the great

13:02.761 --> 13:06.626
It's a wonderful book, I thought.

13:06.646 --> 13:11.631
Vita di Cosimo di Medici.

13:11.651 --> 13:13.694
It's a wonderful combination of names.

13:13.714 --> 13:15.896
It's a beautiful book.

13:15.916 --> 13:20.902
I looked fairly, and I didn't see any of it.

13:20.962 --> 13:27.690
Ren di Toscana.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.253
L-O-S-E-A-N-A.

13:33.001 --> 13:36.526
Oh, this is just wonderful.

13:36.546 --> 13:49.342
You know, really, I'll shut this off.

13:52.527 --> 13:58.114
This wouldn't be the original binding, would it?

13:58.334 --> 14:00.477
Uh, no.

14:01.098 --> 14:05.063
That must be in 1879.

14:06.365 --> 14:07.647
It's quite a nice binding, though.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.330
This is a work I did for fun.

14:10.410 --> 14:15.778
I had a collection of stamps relating to books.

14:15.798 --> 14:17.640
Oh, that's very interesting.

14:17.961 --> 14:19.563
Leonard Gaskin collects those.

14:19.583 --> 14:20.524
Did you know that?

14:20.774 --> 14:24.978
Well, he collects, he's quite an avid collector of that.

14:25.018 --> 14:26.960
I didn't know that.

14:27.020 --> 14:32.465
Stamps relating everything, like title pages, presses, and so forth.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.807
Now, where could I get a copy of this?

14:35.088 --> 14:40.152
I don't want my credo.

14:40.172 --> 14:44.236
I feel a lot better if you took this away from me.

14:44.296 --> 14:46.138
She should give you a picture.

14:46.158 --> 14:46.919
But I don't know where it is.

14:47.259 --> 14:50.342
I have a couple of copies, but I don't know where it is.

14:50.592 --> 14:52.494
We spoke with the Lily Lager.

14:52.695 --> 14:53.816
I'm going out there, by the way.

14:54.016 --> 14:55.798
Yeah, well, Cagle.

14:55.899 --> 14:58.522
Cagle, I've talked to you already.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.384
They're very interesting stories.

15:00.404 --> 15:00.604
Yeah.

15:01.045 --> 15:02.807
Look at this, these stamps.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.109
I haven't collected them.

15:04.129 --> 15:08.935
But I thought, I don't know, you know, stamp collecting is a bit of a chore.

15:08.955 --> 15:11.378
It's really, I don't know how I got into it.

15:11.418 --> 15:13.140
That looks like Isaiah Thomas' press.

15:13.701 --> 15:14.862
I bet you that's Isaiah Thomas.

15:14.882 --> 15:15.723
I think it is.

15:15.743 --> 15:16.724
Yes, I think that's what they did.

15:16.744 --> 15:18.827
They just published a little booklet on the press.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.812
Back there, make sure you get one.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.274
I'll send you one.

15:22.514 --> 15:23.375
Allow me to do that.

15:24.397 --> 15:24.977
It's quite nice.

15:25.518 --> 15:26.780
And I have a couple of things.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.001
Oh, you're wonderful.

15:28.121 --> 15:29.884
I don't know where my antiquarian is.

15:29.904 --> 15:31.165
This is great.

15:32.347 --> 15:33.088
This is super.

15:33.108 --> 15:34.830
This is the kind of thing that I need.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.832
It's the kind of thing that I need.

15:37.013 --> 15:38.815
I don't know if you have it or you don't.

15:38.895 --> 15:40.197
But it's a reconstruction.

15:40.257 --> 15:41.658
Really?

15:42.640 --> 15:45.243
Speaking of the Alzheimer's.

15:46.164 --> 15:48.267
And then I sweep from there.

15:48.307 --> 15:48.527
This is

15:49.823 --> 15:55.068
You said that they're only fragile if they land in the wrong place and in the wrong hands, but that happens.

15:56.249 --> 15:59.111
Unfortunately, tragically, regrettably, it happens.

15:59.131 --> 16:01.593
They're vulnerable rather than fragile.

16:01.853 --> 16:04.356
That's a much better word.

16:04.376 --> 16:05.437
Much better word.

16:05.457 --> 16:07.578
You're welcome.

16:07.899 --> 16:08.619
Yeah, you're welcome.

16:08.639 --> 16:10.941
That's very good.

16:11.001 --> 16:13.404
I think it's true.

16:13.424 --> 16:15.045
But how many people respect books?

16:15.445 --> 16:18.988
I'm sorry, you were going to say something.

16:19.469 --> 16:19.729
No, we don't.

16:20.317 --> 16:23.682
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

16:25.846 --> 16:27.689
I want to hear the arrangement.

16:27.809 --> 16:28.250
Okay.

16:28.470 --> 16:29.612
Well, all right.

16:30.353 --> 16:31.555
So, I'll show you.

16:32.316 --> 16:32.757
So, what?

16:34.079 --> 16:34.560
Jefferson?

16:34.920 --> 16:35.942
The library.

16:36.844 --> 16:37.364
Is that right?

16:37.725 --> 16:38.466
That's right.

16:39.287 --> 16:41.351
Maddie works on that.

16:41.371 --> 16:43.194
Which library are we talking about?

16:43.254 --> 16:43.554
Jacksonville.

16:43.574 --> 16:43.995
Really?

16:46.270 --> 16:48.913
Well, every member of the New England delegation voted against it.

16:48.993 --> 16:51.056
Daniel Webster, and you know why they didn't want it?

16:51.076 --> 16:52.678
I mean, who wanted books by Rabelais?

16:52.718 --> 16:57.584
What does Congress have to concern itself with folks there for it?

16:57.604 --> 16:58.765
I mean, it was really good.

16:58.866 --> 17:05.934
The great Paul Bayer collection of internavials was off of the Library of Congress, I think, in the 20s.

17:07.576 --> 17:09.399
He said, well, there's Paul Bayer.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.500
What is it, a drink?

17:11.722 --> 17:13.404
This is the name of the original Loner.

17:14.044 --> 17:15.366
What do we want with that?

17:15.802 --> 17:20.030
And this was finally perjured to a lot of Stillman drama.

17:20.070 --> 17:20.911
They finally perjured to it.

17:20.931 --> 17:24.117
They were very against, I don't know, I think a million.

17:24.197 --> 17:26.201
I think they were very much against the church.

17:26.722 --> 17:31.290
Well, of course, you should bring the great Martinus Brooks and the Brooks to the Holocaust.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.692
Of course, yeah.

17:32.712 --> 17:34.215
You bring that in.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.082
I'm sorry, I was thinking .

17:36.822 --> 17:39.225
I thought so, because Jefferson's Library did go.

17:39.245 --> 17:42.469
I was thinking to Virginia, too.

17:42.489 --> 17:43.790
I'm sorry, I was thinking of .

17:44.351 --> 17:49.376
But the point is, every Harvard graduate, there were 10 Harvard graduates in Congress voted against it.

17:49.917 --> 17:53.821
There were, I think, eight Yale graduates, only one voted for it.

17:53.881 --> 18:02.010
The day was carried by these purportedly uneducated southerners who thought that the books were a good idea.

18:02.031 --> 18:03.392
Well, it's an interesting little story.

18:03.929 --> 18:11.296
And then I will talk about people like Jeremy Belknap in front of The Messages.

18:14.119 --> 18:24.528
So I think the title of my book is The Gentlest of Infirmities, which is a nice title.

18:24.548 --> 18:31.675
So we will have Isaiah Thomas, Jeremy Belknap, I have a bunch of New Yorkers, Lennox,

18:31.975 --> 18:38.489
The New York Public Library is really three collectors.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.753
That's right.

18:40.894 --> 18:46.305
Three individual collectors.

18:46.555 --> 18:49.679
And I'm told I should talk to Brooke Astor.

18:49.739 --> 18:50.120
What do you think?

18:50.140 --> 18:50.620
Is that a good idea?

18:50.660 --> 18:51.922
It would be fun, I think.

18:51.962 --> 18:53.103
It would be fun.

18:53.123 --> 18:53.264
Sure.

18:53.344 --> 18:55.506
I don't know what you know.

18:55.526 --> 18:57.309
She might not know, but she'd be interesting.

18:57.749 --> 19:00.653
She's a very, very nice name to add to you.

19:00.713 --> 19:04.117
And I'm planning to talk to Larry McMurtry, for instance.

19:04.137 --> 19:05.659
Yes, yes, yes.

19:05.679 --> 19:06.560
He's a book dealer.

19:07.121 --> 19:10.906
He's got four or five bookstores.

19:10.926 --> 19:14.731
One of his novels, Cadillac Jack, is about a bookstove.

19:14.771 --> 19:16.393
The whole novel is about a bookstove.

19:16.475 --> 19:20.379
I've already talked to Ricky Jay, the magician.

19:21.280 --> 19:26.544
He's curator of the Mulholland Library.

19:26.765 --> 19:31.229
Oh, yeah, sure.

19:31.629 --> 19:35.593
Are you getting out of California?

19:35.653 --> 19:36.954
Yes.

19:36.994 --> 19:38.235
He's on my list.

19:38.376 --> 19:43.140
Bill Williams-Self, I've talked to you about the last Camereland.

19:43.677 --> 19:47.742
You want to speak to one of the buildings in Los Angeles?

19:48.624 --> 19:49.285
Yeah.

19:49.305 --> 19:52.990
They have long history.

19:53.050 --> 19:53.590
Dawson?

19:53.610 --> 19:54.391
Yeah, I know.

19:54.632 --> 19:57.656
Dawson's bookshop in Los Angeles.

19:58.036 --> 20:00.099
Yeah, I don't know where Bonnie is now.

20:00.119 --> 20:02.102
I think it's... Bonnie's in Berkeley.

20:04.265 --> 20:05.026
I'll be getting up.

20:05.066 --> 20:06.548
I have to go to the Huntington, of course.

20:07.429 --> 20:10.393
Gene Strauss is doing a biography of Morgan.

20:11.150 --> 20:13.493
And so obviously Morgan will be in there.

20:13.593 --> 20:14.854
I have a wonderful chapter.

20:14.974 --> 20:17.697
I think it's wonderful.

20:17.718 --> 20:18.398
Comager.

20:18.679 --> 20:26.107
No, the letter was from Cass Canfield asking me if I would be interested that Comager had suggested me for it.

20:27.048 --> 20:30.672
And of course, it fascinated me.

20:30.692 --> 20:34.937
And I said, yes, we were both going to work on it.

20:35.017 --> 20:40.043
We were both going to do it if the materials were available.

20:40.478 --> 20:44.382
Who has Cassidy in there?

20:44.402 --> 20:46.084
Well, I imagine the Morgan does.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.268
I got home with Will, which was very interesting.

20:50.189 --> 20:56.256
She left an awful lot of fine jewelry for Cartier.

20:58.919 --> 21:04.625
Well, there's a woman, I'm told, who worked with her.

21:04.986 --> 21:06.467
Morgan had her name.

21:06.627 --> 21:07.609
Well, I wish her luck.

21:07.649 --> 21:08.950
You know who she is?

21:09.824 --> 21:12.288
Some will lose, and I retired from the Morgan.

21:13.049 --> 21:17.537
Because I went through there the last time in New York, and briefly introduced myself.

21:17.737 --> 21:20.783
Harper's tried to get the material to be made available.

21:20.843 --> 21:21.223
Really?

21:22.285 --> 21:23.147
No soap.

21:23.728 --> 21:26.993
You think it's going to be kept unavailable indefinitely?

21:27.013 --> 21:28.295
No, it can't be online.

21:29.077 --> 21:30.559
I wouldn't want to.

21:30.579 --> 21:35.848
But again, I'm interested in so far, that's essential for a biography, but for my book,

21:36.368 --> 21:39.513
But she certainly was an extraordinary woman.

21:39.553 --> 21:40.154
Oh, my God.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.436
She had a lot of room.

21:41.756 --> 21:44.200
She wore a lot of room.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.344
I remember I was there thrashing.

21:46.664 --> 21:47.806
I was at 62nd Manson.

21:47.966 --> 21:51.512
He asked me to put them in the book down in the morning.

21:51.532 --> 21:52.554
I was scared to death.

21:53.054 --> 21:55.859
And I stood in the threshold with the book.

21:56.199 --> 21:58.283
She was just going to make them from death.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.768
My fourth school in the morning, she looked at me and said,

22:02.086 --> 22:06.291
Young lady, bring the book directly into my presence.

22:06.891 --> 22:08.413
That's a great story.

22:08.593 --> 22:09.454
I can use that, right?

22:09.995 --> 22:17.503
Well, I crossed that room to a present, which was a fear and distress.

22:17.983 --> 22:24.210
I remember another time I was doing my original dissertation.

22:24.270 --> 22:30.557
Now, this class, did this happen when you were... I was working for writing when this happened, but I was doing my dissertation.

22:31.111 --> 22:36.577
When I went, I had to go to the mall, and it was something, some newspaper or something, and I went there.

22:37.298 --> 22:42.843
And the librarian, I think, wasn't in charge of the book.

22:43.004 --> 22:47.088
And he said, be very careful if this book is missed.

22:47.769 --> 22:53.154
This copy, the binding, belongs to any of the aid.

22:53.675 --> 22:54.996
No white gloves, though.

22:55.016 --> 22:56.438
No white gloves.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.600
And I just was straight open.

22:58.620 --> 23:00.342
I was straight after the book.

23:00.592 --> 23:02.134
But they love to use it.

23:02.154 --> 23:04.357
Do you know Arthur and Charlotte Vershbow?

23:05.399 --> 23:06.881
They're collectors up in New York.

23:07.241 --> 23:08.863
His name is Arthur Vershbow.

23:09.304 --> 23:10.606
Oh, yeah, sure.

23:10.766 --> 23:14.511
These engravings are biomas.

23:14.531 --> 23:17.195
17th century.

23:17.215 --> 23:22.162
I'd love to hold around this thing, though.

23:22.382 --> 23:22.783
Does that know?

23:22.803 --> 23:23.183
Yes.

23:24.305 --> 23:26.548
Her father taught her the use of the bowling.

23:27.119 --> 23:37.731
How do you rate Lisa Baskin's collection?

23:38.071 --> 23:41.875
You know, we've never seen her collection.

23:42.756 --> 23:47.301
What I saw of it is quite remarkable, I have to say.

23:47.762 --> 23:51.005
When I can see it's a remarkable collection.

23:51.025 --> 23:54.409
And of course, there aren't that many like it.

23:55.030 --> 23:57.273
That's why there is room for the collector, I think.

23:57.533 --> 24:04.403
As long as there's a new area that hasn't been mined and that hasn't been preserved, there is hope for collectors, I think.

24:04.423 --> 24:08.508
He needs space today for the collector.

24:08.528 --> 24:12.394
A hundred years ago, the collector had all the space he needed.

24:12.474 --> 24:15.758
He could afford a huge house.

24:15.778 --> 24:17.140
But today, living

24:17.288 --> 24:18.610
For the average collector.

24:18.670 --> 24:20.533
You don't have a lot, Jerry.

24:20.633 --> 24:24.018
Books just overflow.

24:24.038 --> 24:25.961
They're in the way.

24:26.422 --> 24:31.930
We have a very good friend, who's a great James collector, Andy James collector.

24:31.950 --> 24:35.235
You know how to get into our house?

24:35.275 --> 24:37.118
Because we've said any questions.

24:37.138 --> 24:40.263
You're a marvelous collector.

24:40.283 --> 24:42.486
I've been in a very celebrated future.

24:43.057 --> 24:45.901
I would collect James, if I could afford it.

24:45.921 --> 24:48.684
And she has probably the best private Henry James collector.

24:48.704 --> 24:49.125
Really?

24:49.846 --> 24:50.907
Certainly, one of the best.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.170
She has a significant collection.

24:53.270 --> 24:54.131
Manuscript stuff?

24:54.151 --> 24:54.391
Yes.

24:54.632 --> 24:54.932
Yes.

24:55.253 --> 24:55.773
Letters.

24:56.254 --> 24:56.554
Letters.

24:57.135 --> 24:58.236
Is this somebody I should know?

24:58.437 --> 25:00.019
I think you should know.

25:00.039 --> 25:01.521
Yes, I think you could.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.083
You are very interested.

25:03.103 --> 25:03.823
Who was the receipt?

25:03.843 --> 25:06.787
Her name ... I really need some women collectors, by the way.

25:06.807 --> 25:09.130
Yes, she and I went to college, too.

25:09.150 --> 25:10.071
What's her name?

25:10.272 --> 25:12.895
Her name is Adeline, A-D-E-L-I-N-E.

25:13.010 --> 25:16.915
Tintner is her professional name, T-I-N-T-N-E-L-R.

25:17.035 --> 25:23.703
She's married to Dr. Janowitz, second name is Janowitz, and she lives at 180 East End Avenue.

25:24.805 --> 25:25.706
Can I call her?

25:25.726 --> 25:26.567
Yes, sure.

25:26.587 --> 25:27.208
Call her.

25:27.788 --> 25:29.771
Be sure you tell her we suggest her.

25:29.791 --> 25:34.156
Of course, and if she doesn't want to talk to me, that's fine.

25:34.877 --> 25:36.379
That's great.

25:36.399 --> 25:39.743
She is, I mean, she is, what I would say, a super

25:40.786 --> 25:44.131
But average collector, a person who can afford to collect.

25:44.151 --> 25:44.832
Who can or can't?

25:44.852 --> 25:46.274
She's a very interesting person.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.396
She's a strange woman.

25:47.416 --> 25:48.537
She said can or can't.

25:48.557 --> 25:49.779
She sees connections.

25:49.799 --> 25:53.545
She's done a lot of writing on James based upon her.

25:53.565 --> 25:53.965
Really?

25:54.025 --> 25:55.427
She's written about it.

25:55.447 --> 25:57.010
It's a productive collection.

25:57.030 --> 26:00.615
And so I would find titles under her, under that name, Adeline?

26:00.655 --> 26:01.616
Yes, absolutely.

26:02.658 --> 26:04.420
When I go to Harvard next week, I'll see her.

26:04.641 --> 26:05.562
Absolutely.

26:06.368 --> 26:11.255
You have used my, or seen my book on aspirin books.

26:11.275 --> 26:19.467
Okay, I'm going to ask you both to... To Jefferson, who was then president.

26:20.409 --> 26:24.034
Okay, this is, now this book here is... This is a... Okay.

26:25.256 --> 26:30.604
I've done a lot of work on the Franco-American book trade, and this was...

26:30.820 --> 26:34.666
published by the Philadelphia Philadelphia.

26:34.686 --> 26:35.047
Oh, okay.

26:35.067 --> 26:35.989
That was done in 88.

26:36.269 --> 26:39.795
So I get a copy of this from... You can get a copy of that from them.

26:39.895 --> 26:40.516
Yes, I'm sorry.

26:40.757 --> 26:41.197
That's right.

26:41.277 --> 26:43.601
Philadelphia Club, 1988, Philadelphia.

26:44.783 --> 26:46.186
Okay, let me just read this.

26:46.847 --> 26:49.131
This is January 31st, 1803.

26:49.171 --> 26:49.331
Yes.

26:49.351 --> 26:54.820
President Jefferson, I send you the catalog of books remaining to me from the library of Dr. Franklin.

26:55.390 --> 27:05.164
If you have looked it over, I beg you to deliver it to the librarian of Congress to whom I propose in the belief that it would be so authorized to make the purchase of the collection unblocked or in price.

27:05.785 --> 27:16.861
What were the use for that money, brackets, the sum allocated by Congress for the purchase of the library, sir, that you use it to rescue the books of one of the founders of the American Republicans is very important.

27:16.881 --> 27:19.404
I have a great man, exclamation point.

27:19.424 --> 27:23.490
It is not a spirit of speculation that makes me use this language for outside of the fact

27:23.707 --> 27:30.413
that these books belong in the National Library, being in the Irish crime on the politics, the legislation, and the experience of America.

27:30.433 --> 27:34.796
I would dispose of them at a price so reasonable at one that never accused me of such effect.

27:34.816 --> 27:35.497
So did they buy it?

27:36.217 --> 27:38.139
They didn't.

27:38.159 --> 27:39.740
How did you find that?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.642
Well, I did a lot of work.

27:41.682 --> 27:43.784
How do you find it?

27:44.284 --> 27:45.185
I'm going to have to.

27:45.305 --> 27:52.471
He had to, in the end, auction off parts of it and sell parts of it through the year.

27:52.491 --> 27:52.751
So.

27:52.811 --> 27:53.612
Franklin's book.

27:53.879 --> 27:58.964
Obviously, Franklin was not as revered then as he is today.

27:59.545 --> 28:05.532
The Library of Congress had already spent its allotment.

28:07.434 --> 28:08.415
Unbelievable.

28:08.435 --> 28:13.740
All right, let's do another comment.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.905
1776, 1834.

28:17.945 --> 28:19.887
I guess you ladies go off to the...

28:20.913 --> 28:22.856
We'll go off to the country pretty soon, is that right?

28:22.916 --> 28:25.820
Yeah, hopefully June 9th.

28:26.001 --> 28:26.602
Good for you.

28:27.984 --> 28:38.780
And we have to do a big article for a library, on the collections, and now we have a new program.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.207
So books have, they have given you energy.

28:43.227 --> 28:45.871
They don't stop giving you energy, is what I sense.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.236
I don't think it's really important.

28:49.416 --> 28:50.177
It's amazing.

28:50.579 --> 28:53.563
It doesn't sound like retirement is a word.

28:53.763 --> 28:55.125
It's in your catalog.

28:55.145 --> 28:56.226
Absolutely not.

28:56.707 --> 28:58.369
Now, what is your first name?

28:58.389 --> 28:58.569
Nick.

28:58.589 --> 28:58.990
Nicholas.

28:59.310 --> 28:59.751
Nicholas.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.213
N-I-C-H?

29:01.233 --> 29:01.333
Yes.

29:06.119 --> 29:06.259
Please.

29:06.279 --> 29:07.641
I can get this next week.

29:07.661 --> 29:11.186
And it's B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

29:11.206 --> 29:11.406
Very good.
