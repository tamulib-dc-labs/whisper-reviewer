WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:04.004
that ever developed.

00:04.024 --> 00:08.769
That's still what a library is, including this library.

00:08.789 --> 00:12.514
Steve Riley was here in 1930.

00:13.635 --> 00:17.160
The library probably had 100,000 books.

00:17.180 --> 00:22.186
When Archie and I were here a few years after that, it probably had 120,000 books.

00:22.206 --> 00:31.978
This year, sometimes it's past half a million, and the library is adding net every year 8,000 volumes.

00:32.482 --> 00:41.035
So, in the next 20 years, the library will have to find room for another 150 or 65,000 books.

00:43.719 --> 00:44.079
Books.

00:46.343 --> 00:49.468
A collection of books implies collectors.

00:51.030 --> 00:58.962
And those of you who read Nick Bassman's piece in the New York Times two Sundays ago know, collecting, as he called it, I wrote heroes.

00:59.042 --> 00:59.723
He wrote that here.

01:00.704 --> 01:01.746
No known cure.

01:01.996 --> 01:08.285
I would have called it a bibliomania.

01:08.305 --> 01:09.327
No known cure.

01:09.347 --> 01:17.659
Well, we have two people here who have never been cured of collecting.

01:17.679 --> 01:24.450
Steve, of course, particularly manuscripts, but also books, and actually books, are two world-class collectors.

01:25.211 --> 01:31.480
And we are absolutely delighted that they have agreed to sit down here with Nick Bassbaines, who is writing a book.

01:31.898 --> 01:39.647
on collections and collectors and who will, I guess you say, moderate this affair.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.208
Nick.

01:40.228 --> 01:41.790
Thank you so much.

01:42.791 --> 01:46.235
When you talk about a half million books or... A hundred thousand books.

01:46.636 --> 01:53.764
Of course, what's important to realize is that the university isn't just buying books out of a catalog.

01:54.725 --> 02:00.252
It implies selection, taste, connoisseurship, discrimination, knowing what is really important

02:00.991 --> 02:06.518
what the scholarly community needs to have to nourish the research that goes on.

02:07.659 --> 02:16.810
And what you generally have are people like Steve Riley and Archie Hanna over here who are really among the greatest institutional collectors anywhere.

02:16.870 --> 02:24.279
I just can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here today sitting between these two wonderful and important gentlemen.

02:24.899 --> 02:27.943
As Al has mentioned, I'm writing a book about the formation of collections.

02:28.312 --> 02:54.209
The first person I interviewed for this project two years ago was Steve Riley at the Massachusetts Historical Society, and at the top of my list to see was Archie Hanna, and two weeks ago we spent a lovely time down in Haven, ostensibly to talk about this day, but actually interviewing him for use of my book, so I can't tell you what a great thrill it is for me to be here and how appropriate it is to have these two men here on this occasion.

02:54.829 --> 02:57.373
Not only are they really great

02:57.522 --> 03:10.674
institutional collectors, but they're both Worcester natives, they both graduated from North High School, they both have Clark degrees, and they have both given generously to the formation of and the building of the collections here.

03:11.295 --> 03:13.457
So I guess everything's appropriate across the board.

03:15.899 --> 03:25.268
Briefly, because you all know who these gentlemen are, and I won't go too deeply into their backgrounds because you're familiar with them, but I think a little biographical background is in order.

03:25.771 --> 03:27.814
Steve Riley has four Clark degrees.

03:28.936 --> 03:38.489
This year he will celebrate the 60th anniversary and is receiving his bachelor's degree in 1931, but also his MA, his PhD, and an LLD.

03:46.320 --> 03:52.369
Dr. Riley went to work at the Massachusetts Historical Society as assistant librarian in 1934.

03:52.973 --> 03:59.861
He was librarian from 1947 to 1957, and director and librarian from 1957 to 1973.

04:00.862 --> 04:05.207
How important was Steve to the formation of the collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society?

04:06.288 --> 04:13.476
There is a wonderful exhibit on view now at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and if you have a chance to see it, please go see it.

04:14.377 --> 04:17.260
And they have produced an outstanding catalog

04:17.830 --> 04:44.412
and in the and the title of it is witness to america's past two centuries of collecting by the mhs one chapter in there lewis tucker writes that steve's tenure quote constituted a distinct era a period of unparalleled collection growth and tucker quotes a colleague malcolm freiburg quote for institutional collecting has been concerned steve riley wrote the book riley tucker concludes was jeremy belknap resurrected

04:44.645 --> 04:53.558
He was referring, of course, to the founder of the Society, Jeremy Volnapp, the man who said that the true collector must prowl about like a wolf for the prey.

04:54.460 --> 05:01.550
And Steve, I guess, has many stories to tell about being on the prowl for these wonderful manuscripts that he's brought to the Society.

05:02.712 --> 05:06.598
And he will tell us about the Adams Family Papers, I'm sure, and a number of other things.

05:10.403 --> 05:11.665
Really a wonderful catalog.

05:12.404 --> 05:16.969
Archie Hannah, Archibald Hannah, Jr., Clark A.B., 1939, M.A.

05:17.310 --> 05:23.637
Yale in History, Ph.D., Yale, a Master's from Columbia in Library Sciences.

05:24.358 --> 05:41.078
What is interesting is his great specialty at Yale was Western Americana, and from reading some of the stories, I understand that the first time he crossed the Mississippi was during World War II, when he was sent to Navy Language School in Colorado to learn Japanese.

05:41.581 --> 05:53.852
But after the war, he went back to Yale, and in 1949, he began cataloging the great Western Americana collection donated to Yale by William Robertson Cope.

05:53.952 --> 06:01.459
What he has said in later years is that what this experience allowed him to do was to have every book pass through your hands at least once.

06:01.479 --> 06:03.200
And how many librarians can say that?

06:03.220 --> 06:06.543
But every book in the library, he has handled it at least once.

06:06.563 --> 06:10.727
But he knew not only what Yale had, but what Yale needed.

06:11.348 --> 06:14.573
And in 1952, of course, he was placed in charge of that.

06:15.114 --> 06:18.300
In 1955, he became curator of the Yale Collection of Americana.

06:19.662 --> 06:22.747
As I said, though he knew the strengths of the collection, he also knew the gaps.

06:23.449 --> 06:29.399
But from the outset, he was determined to produce what would ultimately be regarded as the best.

06:30.320 --> 06:37.272
And I think everyone who knows anything about the Yale Collections and Western Americana, if you want to study this subject, you go to New Haven.

06:38.078 --> 06:44.407
Of course, numbers are numbers, but when Archie began collecting for Yale, there were 10,000 books in that section.

06:44.867 --> 06:50.796
Thirty years later, the number was 30,000 volumes, and I guess the number of manuscripts tripled as well during their tenure.

06:52.298 --> 06:58.807
Archie, though he has traveled extensively, he always knew the value of knowing people.

06:59.888 --> 07:07.579
When we had lunch a couple weeks ago, I mentioned the legendary Bill Jackson from Harvard.

07:07.981 --> 07:10.703
He said, well, you know, Bill Jackson was the best friend Yale ever had.

07:14.046 --> 07:15.688
I said, what do you mean?

07:15.708 --> 07:16.409
Good old reporter.

07:16.429 --> 07:17.289
Gee, what do you mean by that?

07:17.950 --> 07:24.055
And he said, well, Mr. Jackson basically ignored the bookseller.

07:24.075 --> 07:25.697
And Archie didn't do that.

07:25.957 --> 07:31.982
And so consequently, when something really choice came up, who got the first crack, right?

07:33.604 --> 07:35.946
I guess that a lot of this is knowing

07:36.263 --> 07:40.710
not only what you want, but who has it, and how it can help the collection.

07:42.072 --> 07:44.997
Both of these men have been very generous to Clark.

07:45.037 --> 07:46.659
They've given collections.

07:47.480 --> 07:59.880
And Archie, I noticed, has no fewer than a dozen important collections from his own library, including what I think is a unique social fiction collection, a utopian fiction collection, and the John Buchanan collection.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.385
So Clark has really

08:04.006 --> 08:06.368
has benefited greatly from both of these.

08:06.488 --> 08:07.609
That's my introduction.

08:07.730 --> 08:11.213
I hope it hasn't gone too long, because I know you want to hear from these gentlemen.

08:13.015 --> 08:17.519
Between them, they have so many years of collecting, and I guess there has to be a high spot.

08:17.639 --> 08:19.801
So, Steve, this is your 60th anniversary of Clark.

08:19.841 --> 08:27.509
Why don't we start with you and ask you what has been the most satisfying experience as a collector over these years?

08:29.511 --> 08:33.034
Well, every time I get a collection, it was a very satisfying experience.

08:33.942 --> 08:43.396
And the one person that interested me was an early trustee at Clark, Judge Brisby Hall.

08:45.178 --> 08:50.746
And I knew that there must be a collection somewhere of his papers.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.651
I think it was Ted Shipton who put me on the track.

08:54.652 --> 09:00.861
And he asked me, he said he thought that Mrs. Reginald Foster

09:01.718 --> 09:04.643
probably knew a great deal about the collection.

09:05.665 --> 09:16.242
So I called her, I asked her about the collection, and she said, well, why don't you come with me and we'll visit the old house?

09:16.262 --> 09:20.509
And she said, we'll have a picnic luncheon, so you bring half and I'll bring half.

09:22.332 --> 09:24.135
So we very gladly did that.

09:24.155 --> 09:27.220
So we went down and the whole house was

09:27.487 --> 09:28.568
And that was bad.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.812
I made a mistake on that one.

09:32.813 --> 09:39.380
We went to the house, which was next to Memorial Hospital in Beaumont Street.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.001
And when I went in, I was scared to death.

09:41.041 --> 09:43.724
But I thought no one had lived in this house for years.

09:44.065 --> 09:46.147
And the wiring looked terrible.

09:46.507 --> 09:49.650
And I thought, I wonder how long this house is going to stand.

09:49.690 --> 09:56.818
So we roamed around and just loaded material with books and manuscripts.

09:57.558 --> 10:04.147
And we had lunch out on the piazza with bees humming around us.

10:04.167 --> 10:15.542
And then she said, well, now, she said, you must write me a letter and tell me why the papers should go to the Massachusetts Historical Society.

10:16.924 --> 10:20.789
And I said, well, of course, you had a very close contact with Henry Capital Lodge.

10:20.849 --> 10:22.992
They were senators at the same time.

10:24.170 --> 10:30.478
and I said that we have the large papers, and I think it would be nice if they joined up together.

10:30.498 --> 10:42.715
So she said, well, I'll think about it, and write me a letter, because everyone wants those papers, and let me know why they should go to the MHS.

10:42.755 --> 10:51.747
Well, I repeated what I had to say, and so we were invited to go and get the papers, so we had to hire a truck.

10:51.777 --> 10:59.404
And I think all the staff at the MHS went on that expedition, and we brought back really some marvelous things.

11:00.485 --> 11:10.674
And one of the things that I didn't expect to find, but did find, was material relating to the famous Parkman-Webster murder case.

11:12.396 --> 11:19.422
And I found in the collection one of the

11:20.245 --> 11:23.870
Rockwood Hoare may well have been involved in the case.

11:24.632 --> 11:25.253
He was a lawyer.

11:26.134 --> 11:42.378
And so here are the little notes scribbled by Webster, passed across to his attorneys because apparently he couldn't appear in his own case.

11:42.398 --> 11:42.859
Is that right?

11:43.680 --> 11:46.945
And so it's fascinating because I just

11:47.178 --> 11:55.131
So we've gotten through working with a Mr. Sullivan who wrote a book on the Parkman-Webster case.

11:56.092 --> 12:01.141
And we had material at the Society, but this new material was also very helpful.

12:02.182 --> 12:05.187
At any rate, we carried away with this group of

12:05.639 --> 12:10.744
I must say that the people at the Society are always ready to drop everything and go out if there are papers at hand.

12:11.324 --> 12:15.368
So we came back with the papers, and it's one of the strongest collections we have.

12:15.388 --> 12:17.410
It's a very large collection of papers.

12:18.211 --> 12:24.517
She was very nice, and she hasn't wanted to recall the papers yet.

12:25.858 --> 12:33.165
Another collection that interested me was the Godfrey Cabot papers.

12:34.377 --> 12:36.459
I was a little bit alarmed about this collection.

12:38.081 --> 12:47.850
A biography of Gautry Cabot had been written by someone in Texas, and they didn't keep very close attention to what was being said in the book.

12:48.350 --> 12:52.334
And there was a footnote there, which was sexual.

12:52.774 --> 12:57.939
And apparently, I don't think they even bothered to read what had been written.

12:58.119 --> 13:01.903
And so the first thing I said, well, we better

13:02.221 --> 13:04.343
get those papers just as fast as we can.

13:04.664 --> 13:17.718
I can't quite remember the name.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.081
This is the man I used to visit.

13:21.101 --> 13:28.509
He used to give me a quart of heavy cream and a dozen of fresh eggs every time I went to see him.

13:28.529 --> 13:31.032
Mr. Bradley.

13:31.052 --> 13:32.093
Mrs. Bradley came with

13:32.478 --> 13:34.741
faithfully through the society.

13:34.761 --> 13:39.067
I always sat in front seat, and after about five minutes she'd fall asleep.

13:40.189 --> 13:45.135
Not because things weren't very good that were being presented, but she was an elderly lady.

13:45.957 --> 13:52.646
And so I dealt with her husband, and he died.

13:52.686 --> 13:55.630
He had had a heart problem, and I never knew it.

13:55.650 --> 14:01.438
He had a jeep, and he'd go bounding over all the land, not probably caring very much about it.

14:02.009 --> 14:10.703
So, but I talked to him, and he was interested, but he said, I thought that some approach had been made to the Smithsonian.

14:11.805 --> 14:15.551
And one day he called me and said, I want you to come out to the house.

14:16.412 --> 14:20.919
He said, the band from the Smithsonian is here, and you've got to come out too.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.161
Well, you know.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.625
that can exactly fill me with enthusiasm.

14:25.446 --> 14:32.296
But I started out and found out that this math in Smithsonian had been shifted to another department.

14:33.198 --> 14:37.564
And he didn't seem to be terribly interested in the papers.

14:38.005 --> 14:45.776
He said, and I said, well, at the meeting, I said, I don't believe in breaking up collections and having one part go here and one part go there.

14:46.457 --> 14:51.304
And I said, if the collection is beginning somewhere, I heard that it'll go as one collection.

14:52.145 --> 14:56.952
So, riding home with a man from Smithsonian, he said, you know, I agree with you.

14:57.613 --> 14:59.315
He said, the collection should not be broken up.

14:59.655 --> 15:03.000
And so we did get that collection, and that was fine.

15:04.762 --> 15:17.340
Those are the two, and I mentioned them earlier, that throughout the Goddard papers, I felt that they should go to Clark.

15:18.682 --> 15:19.603
Actually,

15:20.815 --> 15:31.350
President Jefferson had a real meeting, a group of people, I think mostly trustees, trying to find out what to do with the papers.

15:31.371 --> 15:42.587
And, well, someone wanted to know, well, you ought to have a part for this and so forth, but my background meant

15:43.630 --> 15:50.100
I didn't want anything but the papers, and so we did get the papers.

15:51.603 --> 15:57.832
It's a big collection, and I see a little note I put down.

16:01.659 --> 16:10.212
Somewhere he had just received word of his first successful flight plane, because he was very much interested in aviation.

16:10.782 --> 16:15.346
And I think you wrote for the Wright brothers, wanting when they'd be able to carry freight.

16:17.909 --> 16:22.933
So, I think that my friend can carry on.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.034
Okay, great.

16:24.214 --> 16:32.021
Of course, Steve's specialty was, I think we pointed this out, but Steve really specialized in the acquisition of manuscripts.

16:32.582 --> 16:40.249
And we have a pretty nice balance where Archie really, though he also acquired manuscripts, his focus primarily was in printed books.

16:40.668 --> 16:51.418
And one of the things we were talking about earlier is the relationship between an institution and a private collector and the building of collections for libraries.

16:51.438 --> 16:53.260
Maybe we can start out a little bit there, actually.

16:55.482 --> 16:55.702
Hello.

16:56.002 --> 17:08.734
I would like to talk about one, because sometimes it isn't the size of the thing that gives you the most satisfaction,

17:09.119 --> 17:13.385
the serendipity of it.

17:15.408 --> 17:36.038
One of the most unusual things relating to the California Gold Rush is a series of colored lithographs published in 1850 in, of all places, Havana, Cuba, by two Spanish artists named Faran and Patroni.

17:36.760 --> 17:41.445
And this is, of course, highly desirable.

17:41.886 --> 17:51.277
The two of them had been to San Francisco in 1849, made some paintings, went back to Havana, and had them lithographed and published and sold.

17:52.218 --> 17:55.342
I knew about the existence of this.

17:56.363 --> 18:04.152
I had never seen even a single one of the twelve of them offered for sale.

18:04.655 --> 18:13.364
Supposedly the only copy of this with twelve lithographs was in the New York Historical Society.

18:14.545 --> 18:31.101
And one day I was in Boston and, as usual, called on Good Speeds and Mike Walsh, who was head of their Americana department, and he said, oh, I'm glad you stopped in.

18:31.351 --> 18:35.956
Usually, when I stopped there, he said, what brought you to Boston?

18:35.976 --> 18:37.377
I don't have anything to show you.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.401
But he said, I think I've got something to show you.

18:41.901 --> 18:51.050
And I don't know why, but out of the back of my mind, I said, what is it, the Ferran Impateroni?

18:51.731 --> 19:00.700
And he looked at me, and he went to the safe and opened it up and brought out an oblong volume.

19:01.102 --> 19:07.048
The Faran and Baturani lithographs, not 12 of them, but 14.

19:07.529 --> 19:12.714
So that really makes a collector's day.

19:13.495 --> 19:29.472
A research library, if it's going to have the kind of material it needs for scholarly research, cannot depend

19:29.722 --> 19:32.246
on itself or its own budget.

19:32.927 --> 19:50.152
As I think most of you know very well, any academic librarian who can squeeze enough money out of the administration just to come somewhere near coping with the daily demands on the part of students and faculty is doing very well.

19:50.713 --> 19:58.665
There is never anything left over for building research special collections, and yet

19:58.983 --> 20:05.511
These you need for not only your graduate program.

20:07.494 --> 20:15.083
College seniors these days are doing research on a level that in my day was thought only appropriate for PhD candidates.

20:16.144 --> 20:19.028
So, you've got to provide the material for them.

20:19.048 --> 20:20.390
How are you going to do it?

20:21.171 --> 20:26.998
And as far as I know, the best answer is the private collector.

20:27.670 --> 20:35.423
And certainly this is how most of Yale's great collections got built.

20:37.065 --> 20:53.172
Essentially, it started in 1924 when one of the professors in the English department, Chauncey Brewster Pinkert, who was himself a book collector, addressed the alumni

20:53.607 --> 21:23.023
Yale was just thinking of building a brand new library building, what is now the Sterling Library, and the alumni were very excited about that, and Tink pointed out to them that it had to have books to go in it, and that they should take it upon themselves to form the kind of book collections their college needed, and then give them to the library.

21:23.695 --> 21:33.410
And out of that speech came, a few years later, an organization named the Yale Library Associates, which is Yale's friends of the library group.

21:34.652 --> 21:40.861
And Tink was not only a collector himself, he inspired a whole generation of collectors.

21:41.863 --> 21:46.149
One of them eventually became university librarian at Yale, Jim Babb.

21:46.810 --> 21:50.496
And Jim was a book collector, but as university librarian,

21:50.611 --> 21:52.313
he collected collectors.

21:53.414 --> 22:16.821
And so during his tenure, many of the outstanding book collections in everything from the field of Boswell and Dr. Johnson down to Western Americana, Yale has a surprising Tibetan collection

22:17.493 --> 22:25.241
formed by a man who, well, he was an architectural draftsman at the time Sterling Library was being built.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.384
Later he was a furniture salesman.

22:28.525 --> 22:47.365
He was a personal friend of the Dalai Lama and brought together an absolutely amazing collection of Buddhist literature and history from Tibet, all of which is now at Yale.

22:47.733 --> 23:06.835
Jim not only collected collectors, he also understood perhaps better than most librarians of his day the key role that the antiquarian booksellers had to play in building collections.

23:06.855 --> 23:15.225
In fact, when we had finished cataloging the book collection, I was summoned to his office

23:15.762 --> 23:18.485
And he said, well, I've decided to give you the collection.

23:19.487 --> 23:23.011
How well you do with it will depend on your relations with the booksellers.

23:23.331 --> 23:26.315
Get out of here and go meet them.

23:26.415 --> 23:31.101
And I spent a great deal of the next 30 years cultivating booksellers.

23:32.443 --> 23:43.116
And you know, when a rare book dealer gets something really desirable, he does not lie awake at night chewing his nails wondering how he's going to get rid of it.

23:43.136 --> 23:43.997
The question is,

23:44.163 --> 23:47.747
To whom shall I offer this?

23:47.767 --> 23:54.696
And if Yale comes to his mind first, then Yale's collections will get built.

23:56.758 --> 24:02.525
There is an international league of antiquarian booksellers.

24:04.107 --> 24:09.854
And the first time they ever met in the United States was sometime in the 1950s.

24:09.934 --> 24:11.976
They met in New York.

24:12.445 --> 24:18.471
And all of them, 150 of them and their wives, were invited to New Haven for a day.

24:19.672 --> 24:26.199
There was lunch at the Lawn Club, cocktails at the Medical Historical Library.

24:26.940 --> 24:32.886
All of them were then invited to a buffet supper at the Liebert's.

24:32.926 --> 24:35.128
He was head of the workroom.

24:35.148 --> 24:40.073
There were special exhibitions, tours of the library.

24:40.795 --> 24:50.569
In those days, this was before we had a separate rare book library, Sterling Library has a Gothic nave like a cathedral.

24:50.836 --> 25:19.662
in fact as you open the front door and go down you look down this long nave and at the far end of the circulation desk with a symbolic mural behind it the story is that one stranger came in looked down the nave dropped to one knee crossed himself out again but in those days the gutenberg bible sat in its own case down at the end of the nave and one french bookseller came down the nave looking at

25:19.777 --> 25:30.608
all these rare books on display in the exhibition cases, came to the Gutenberg, five of them said, huh, a trimmed copy.

25:31.549 --> 25:40.999
I suppose that particular day's outing, for that, Jim Babb must have had to find three or four thousand dollars somewhere.

25:42.061 --> 25:48.147
He probably went to one of his book collector friends and got it, but

25:48.329 --> 25:57.842
what that did in terms of relationships for Yale with booksellers was absolutely incalculable.

25:59.124 --> 26:16.108
And so that over the years, many booksellers, well, the ideal, of course, is to get the bookseller to send you page proofs of his forthcoming catalog,

26:16.375 --> 26:21.422
And if he won't do that, well, at least send you the catalog first-class mail.

26:22.584 --> 26:36.603
And when you get a catalog from an important bookseller, you drop everything and go through that catalog and mark the things you want and spend an hour or two hours or whatever it takes at the cart catalog.

26:37.104 --> 26:41.370
And then you get on the phone immediately and place your order.

26:42.127 --> 27:09.467
And if you're very lucky, you may get as many as half of the things you want, where if you follow sound administrative practice and turn this routine job of checking the catalog over to a clerical assistant instead of doing it yourself, ten days later you'll have the catalog back and then you

27:09.548 --> 27:20.086
You dictate a letter to the bookseller and send the proper order form, seven copies each, and you don't get any books.

27:21.328 --> 27:34.189
But, you know, in spite of the fact that this is the most efficient way of doing things, is cultivating the booksellers, the real reason is because the booksellers are so much fun.

27:34.338 --> 27:40.969
They are perhaps an even more eccentric lot than the book collectors.

27:42.972 --> 28:00.480
Any good antiquarian bookseller, given the same amount of time, expert knowledge, and effort that goes into his business, could be making four times as much as an upper-level executive in a big conglomerate.

28:00.882 --> 28:07.511
but they are all individualists, and none of them would ever consider changing their jobs.

28:10.154 --> 28:27.396
I think one thing I failed to mention earlier is that when we talk about the Massachusetts Historical Society, the perception might be that the collection is primarily Massachusetts, but I think being the oldest such institution of its kind in the United States,

28:28.203 --> 28:33.628
At the beginning, at least, the MHS, Steve, I guess, collected everything, not just Massachusetts.

28:33.648 --> 28:45.060
And when your tenure began, the volume became so great that you really had to refine the focus and really key on Massachusetts.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.763
Is this a fair assessment?

28:47.783 --> 28:53.248
Well, at the very beginning, when it was founded,

28:56.806 --> 29:01.770
1794, just celebrating our 200th anniversary.

29:03.132 --> 29:11.139
All those who were going to be made members of the society had to promise they were going to provide some books and so forth with the collection.

29:11.159 --> 29:18.625
And so they did, and there were only eight to begin with, and they gradually increased their number.

29:18.665 --> 29:26.492
It got to be 25, I think it was about 50 elected members when I went there, but it's now around 200.

29:27.164 --> 29:31.409
But their members have been very generous.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.352
Most of them were book collectors to begin with.

29:35.153 --> 29:44.424
And then, as time went on, some of the old families have turned their papers over to us.

29:45.165 --> 29:49.590
That's a great advantage of having a lot of Brahmins in Boston.

29:51.072 --> 29:55.197
But the biggest collection, I suppose the collection that I always interested

29:55.953 --> 30:03.003
people, what's going to happen to the Adams papers.

30:03.024 --> 30:24.255
Well, we've had an Adams on the membership of the Society since 1800, and then the president of the Massachusetts Historical Society, 1950-57, was John Adams.

30:25.568 --> 30:29.572
His son succeeded him, and I came to know him quite well.

30:32.675 --> 30:38.741
Scholars have been very much concerned about their inability to get at the Adams papers.

30:39.681 --> 30:43.565
It was probably the most famous collection for national history that we have.

30:45.387 --> 30:52.774
And in the middle 50s, the scholars

30:53.446 --> 30:58.874
who were more and more anxious to have at least a microphone made off the papers and made available to scholars.

31:00.277 --> 31:12.736
And the meeting was held at the old house in Quincy, and some of the great editors, like Lyman Butterfield and Julian Burry and others, all joined together.

31:12.776 --> 31:18.525
We went down there, and they, Tom Adams and his father,

31:19.163 --> 31:24.190
thought it might be wise to have a microfilm edition to make sure that it would be safe anyway.

31:25.231 --> 31:29.918
So we went ahead and it took us a long time to make a microfilm edition.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.783
There are over 600 rolls of microfilm.

31:36.527 --> 31:47.702
And we were also interested in another collection that had been on deposit for some years, and that was the Paul Revere collection.

31:49.775 --> 32:02.308
In 1798, Jeremy Belknap persuaded Paul Revere to write an account of his right, and the longest account of his right is known in that copy.

32:03.269 --> 32:11.577
I acquired later from Revere's sisters the first draft of it, and then I saw a second copy.

32:13.299 --> 32:19.765
They told me later that they had taken everything from them except two silver spoons.

32:20.032 --> 32:21.694
They're wonderful people.

32:22.015 --> 32:41.639
And then what had been set up was they saw an organization that drew from all Adamses, and they got permission to have a room at the Society where the Adams papers were kept.

32:43.301 --> 32:45.364
We had no control over them whatsoever.

32:45.614 --> 32:48.677
In fact, I don't think I ever got in the room for the first 25 years.

32:51.019 --> 33:02.890
But time came, and Samuel Fag Bemis, who was a graduate of this college, was doing his life at John Quincy Adams.

33:02.910 --> 33:12.499
And fortunately, the man who had charged as a twin of John Adams, Henry Adams, who spent his day going over the papers,

33:12.817 --> 33:17.083
Sam Bemis was working in the room, and so he'd go through the papers looking for things for Sam Bemis.

33:17.123 --> 33:19.065
It was a very nice arrangement.

33:19.085 --> 33:31.261
And out of it came across the great two volumes, which won a full surprise, of John Quincy Adams.

33:31.281 --> 33:36.107
Well, this time going on, it was getting close to the next 50 years, and what were they going to do about it?

33:37.930 --> 33:42.115
And a lot of holding their butts at that time.

33:42.989 --> 33:51.058
they finally decided to turn the whole collection over to the Massachusetts Historical Society.

33:51.078 --> 33:53.161
I don't think they ever took a deduction.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.263
I'm not sure about that.

33:56.384 --> 34:05.214
But then they came with a great rejoicing, and the deed of gifts consisted of two small paragraphs.

34:06.616 --> 34:09.199
The Paul Revere papers were given to us of the same day,

34:10.850 --> 34:12.391
And there was only one paragraph.

34:12.432 --> 34:18.497
So here are two of the great, great collections that have come through the Society.

34:18.918 --> 34:21.861
And they have been used by scholars.

34:22.862 --> 34:28.727
In fact, there's hardly anything at the Massachusetts Historical Society that's not open to scholars.

34:29.828 --> 34:33.151
We do not like to put restrictions on them.

34:33.171 --> 34:39.017
And of course, we are used primarily by scholars.

34:39.655 --> 34:47.746
and Lucy Morrison, all they said was that when he first went to the Society back in the 80s, he wasn't allowed to use the catalog.

34:49.849 --> 34:51.752
But all of these things have turned out well.

34:52.112 --> 34:55.377
It's a growing institution.

34:55.878 --> 35:01.826
Our real problem is that we built in addition to the building in 1971.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.515
And now our space is gone again.

35:09.254 --> 35:15.086
Some of the salt and salt sent in these papers, nine or seven tons of papers.

35:16.008 --> 35:18.594
All of a sudden, your space is going.

35:19.095 --> 35:24.647
And we get big collections like that, and they have to be preserved.

35:25.228 --> 35:26.892
Alice worked on them.

35:28.014 --> 35:29.878
She said, you can say that, Alice.

35:30.432 --> 35:34.356
that you worked on it because I couldn't find anybody else to work on them?

35:37.158 --> 35:51.252
There are so many fascinating things that have come into the society.

35:52.453 --> 35:58.178
I'm going to take a chance and read a couple of things which have always impressed me very much.

36:01.634 --> 36:09.264
I am not going to read to you the famous Newburgh Address, written by George Washington.

36:12.508 --> 36:26.966
When members of the army, the officers had not been paid, and there was a little insurrection coming, and he assembled them and read this speech to him, which just did away with the insurrection.

36:27.647 --> 36:30.831
But there's one that I'm going to try on you.

36:31.469 --> 36:34.292
I didn't fare very well with this one I gave in Virginia.

36:39.398 --> 36:56.497
This is a letter, a dispatch dated at Madrid on February 6, 1878, by the Honorable James Russell Lowell, at that time minister, putting portentiary to Spain.

36:57.378 --> 36:58.759
He writes, quotes,

36:59.836 --> 37:10.393
One of the devices of four-card, which came within Mr. Sowell's knowledge, went in another department of the government, was so ingenious and amusing as to be worth recounting.

37:12.135 --> 37:16.863
The Frenchman's object was to smuggle petroleum into Madrid without paying the tax.

37:18.145 --> 37:21.490
To this end, he established his storehouse in the suburbs.

37:22.617 --> 37:26.962
and then hiring all the leanest and least mammalian women that could be found.

37:28.544 --> 37:38.096
He made good all their physical defects with ten cases filled with petroleum.

37:39.317 --> 37:43.943
Thus getting them what Dr. Johnson would have called the pectoral proportions of Juno.

37:46.126 --> 37:51.392
Doubtless he blasphemed the unwise parsimony of nature in denying to women in general

37:51.862 --> 37:56.988
the multitudinous breasts displayed by certain Hindu idols.

37:57.308 --> 38:09.282
For some time, these milky mothers passed without question into the unsuspecting city and supplied thousands of households with that cheap enlightenment, which cynics say is worse than none.

38:10.444 --> 38:17.873
Meanwhile, Monsieur Foucault's pockets swelled in exact proportion to the Quaker breastworks of the improvised wet nurses.

38:20.375 --> 38:21.717
Could he only have been moderate?

38:22.321 --> 38:26.815
could he only have bethought him in time of the naked Nemus.

38:28.019 --> 38:34.440
But on a fatal day he sent in a damsel whose contours aroused in one of the guardians at the gates.

38:34.977 --> 38:39.044
The same emotions as those of Maritone's in the bosom of the carrier.

38:40.326 --> 38:47.299
With the playful gallantry of a superior, he tapped the object of his admiration and it tinkled.

38:49.202 --> 38:52.047
He had struck oil unawares.

38:53.089 --> 38:54.592
Love shook his wings and fled.

38:54.612 --> 38:57.036
Doobie ended drowning.

38:57.742 --> 39:01.568
Monsieur Foucault's perambulating wells suddenly went dry.

39:06.755 --> 39:12.484
I spoke before the Virginia Historical Society and I blazed out a lot of stony faces.

39:17.612 --> 39:20.015
So, I'm glad I got this response.

39:20.075 --> 39:22.719
I might read it again sometime.

39:22.739 --> 39:26.685
But I also... I...

39:27.121 --> 39:31.186
take a few quotations of the ones that interested me.

39:31.206 --> 39:32.588
This is Harriet Beecher's Still.

39:34.190 --> 39:39.937
Today, I have taken my pen from the last chapter of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

39:39.957 --> 39:46.825
And I think you will understand me when I say that I feel as if I had written some of it almost with my heart's blood.

39:48.127 --> 39:52.772
I look upon it almost as a despairing appeal to civilized humanity.

39:53.754 --> 39:56.537
In the close of it, I think you may trace the result

39:57.057 --> 40:00.643
of some of your suggestions, that was asked, ma'am.

40:00.663 --> 40:14.325
It has been the most cheering thing about the whole endeavor to me, that men like you would feel it, while so deeply has the cause I speak for, is low in itself with my life.

40:14.345 --> 40:19.774
That sympathy for that seems to me almost a personal failure.

40:26.622 --> 40:34.853
But I suppose most of you have heard the exchange between Lincoln and Edward Everett, if you watch the Civil Law series on television.

40:35.654 --> 40:36.816
Well, those have to be ours.

40:38.618 --> 40:45.828
But Edward Everett wrote a little bit more, which I think is interesting.

40:47.050 --> 40:49.953
He said, all of us at one time could recite the Gettysburg Address.

40:51.275 --> 40:54.840
May I close by relating the circumstances under which it was given?

40:56.204 --> 41:02.773
You will remember that when Lincoln gave his classic address, he was preceded by a speaker who talked for several hours.

41:03.834 --> 41:09.902
That speaker was Edward Everett, one of the great artists of the day, whose name is now largely forgotten.

41:11.204 --> 41:20.937
Some time ago, we acquired the Everett Tapes, which contained not only Everett's diaries and letter books, but also his incoming correspondence.

41:20.957 --> 41:25.823
This description of what occurred at the dedication of the cemetery at Gettysburg follows.

41:26.630 --> 41:29.033
November 18, 1863.

41:29.293 --> 41:44.770
At about five, the president, accompanied by several members of his cabinet, with the French minister and Admiral Reynaud, the Italian minister, and some other foreign personages, arrived.

41:46.532 --> 41:52.498
Parties continued to arrive all the evening, and an immense number of persons filled up the little town.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.962
Thirty-eight were lodged at Mr. Wills,

41:56.735 --> 42:03.383
Governor Curtin did not get in until 11, and at first it was proposed to put the governor into my bed with me.

42:04.444 --> 42:06.726
He kindly went out and found the lodging elsewhere.

42:07.868 --> 42:11.251
Two ladies were put into bed with Charlie.

42:11.271 --> 42:13.634
That's the daughter, Charlotte.

42:13.814 --> 42:24.987
The bed broke down and she retook herself to the floor, but the Amy and Bo family made the most herculean and as far as possible successful efforts to accommodate us.

42:25.760 --> 42:31.507
I mention these facts only to show the prodigious resort to the little town.

42:31.527 --> 42:34.852
The person spoke a few words in the evening to the multitude in the street.

42:35.813 --> 42:38.116
I did not get to bed till half past 11.

42:39.057 --> 42:44.644
And the fear of having the executive of Pennsylvania tumbled in upon me kept me awake till one.

42:45.786 --> 42:49.831
Nervousness about tomorrow, no doubt, had something to do with my unrest.

42:51.413 --> 42:52.835
Thursday, November 19.

42:54.216 --> 42:55.598
The sun slightly veiled.

42:55.898 --> 42:58.341
but upon the whole, a most favorable day.

42:59.363 --> 43:01.706
The procession started punctually at 10.

43:02.487 --> 43:03.448
The president mounted.

43:04.289 --> 43:09.676
I went in a carriage with the president of the college, Dr. Stockton, the chaplain, and Mr. Wills.

43:10.518 --> 43:15.184
We reached a tent pitched at my request in the rear of the platform.

43:16.205 --> 43:24.336
I requested and was promised that it would be and it should be in two divisions, one for my private use with a peau de chambre.

43:25.193 --> 43:39.432
On arriving, I found to my dismay that the tent was not double and that the canvas front and rear gaped wide so that all privacy was out of the question, though the only utensil was provided covered with the newspaper.

43:40.894 --> 43:45.420
Into this tent, thus arrayed, I was ushered with eight or ten men and women.

43:47.323 --> 43:52.129
They, by degrees, comprehended the nature of the position and left me alone.

43:55.197 --> 44:08.248
that we alone masters at the words of it.

44:08.268 --> 44:11.671
Dinner of the evening at Mr. Willis for a very large company.

44:12.912 --> 44:15.154
The poor president had to attend an hour with that.

44:15.174 --> 44:17.997
You will notice that no mention is made of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.

44:19.258 --> 44:24.242
On the following day, however, Everett wrote Lincoln, thanking him for many kindnesses

44:24.745 --> 44:28.210
and tending him the following tribute.

44:28.230 --> 44:38.965
Permit me also to express my great admiration of the thoughts expressed by you with such eloquent simplicity and appropriateness at the consecration of the cemetery.

44:40.046 --> 44:49.920
I should be glad, if I could flatter myself, that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes.

44:49.940 --> 44:54.246
My son who parted from me at Baltimore and my daughter conferred in this sentiment.

44:55.424 --> 45:01.052
Lincoln's reply to Herbert's letter is one of our most prized documents, written the same day.

45:01.092 --> 45:02.994
Your kind notice today is received.

45:03.975 --> 45:11.385
In our respective parts yesterday, you could not have been excused to make a chartered dress, nor I alone won.

45:12.427 --> 45:18.014
I am pleased to know that in your judgment, the little I did say was not entirely a failure.

45:19.216 --> 45:23.862
Of course I knew Mr. Everett would not fail, and yet while the whole discourse

45:25.158 --> 45:32.625
was eminently satisfactory and will be of great value, there were passages in it which transcended my expectation.

45:33.445 --> 45:46.297
The point made against the theory of the general government being only an agency whose principles are the states was new to me and as I think is one of the best arguments for the national supremacy.

45:47.357 --> 45:54.844
The tribute to our noble woman for their angel ministering to the suffering soldiers surpasses in its way

45:55.263 --> 45:58.728
as do the subjects of it, whatever has gone before.

45:59.969 --> 46:04.215
Our sick boy, for whom you kindly inquire, we hope is past the worst.

46:05.016 --> 46:06.458
Your obedient servant, Abe Lincoln.

46:06.478 --> 46:11.505
Of course, that was Ted, who died.

46:11.525 --> 46:13.648
I could read a lot more, but I guess it's time.

46:13.748 --> 46:16.552
A quick question, Steve.

46:17.974 --> 46:21.038
Did these just come to the Society as part of it?

46:21.378 --> 46:24.763
Nearly all the papers that come to the Society come as gifts.

46:25.452 --> 46:36.545
They mostly come from old, distinguished people who have served in superior offices.

46:36.565 --> 46:39.829
Edward Everett, of course, was one of the great, great orators of his day.

46:40.290 --> 46:41.371
He was president of Harvard.

46:41.391 --> 46:42.773
He did do a very good job there.

46:43.293 --> 46:44.955
And he was minister to Great Britain.

46:45.896 --> 46:54.767
He was one of the first ones to the Greek Revolution of 1825, and one of the first people to go abroad to study at a German university.

46:55.355 --> 47:04.764
And it was a huge collection of papers.

47:04.784 --> 47:07.447
A key phrase that Steve used is deed of gift.

47:07.467 --> 47:08.548
I think that's very important.

47:09.148 --> 47:13.333
During lunch today, I think you said the most you ever spent for a book was $26,000.

47:14.053 --> 47:16.035
That was two books.

47:16.055 --> 47:25.024
There is kind of a difference in focus where the Massachusetts Historical Society is

47:25.426 --> 47:31.535
collecting papers and they are really also interested in having the papers given to them.

47:31.615 --> 47:39.207
At an educational institution like Harvard, an academic institution, you do have a curriculum, I gather, Archie, that you kind of have to keep in mind.

47:39.628 --> 47:40.248
Is that a fair?

47:40.689 --> 47:53.188
Well, essentially the library is faced with an impossible situation in that the first obligation is the needs of the present curriculum.

47:53.523 --> 48:15.911
faculty members doing their own research approach the library, and if you have a faculty member who is, let's say, working on the history of German East Africa, he is demanding that you provide him with materials for that.

48:17.373 --> 48:19.395
Somehow you manage to find those,

48:19.679 --> 48:37.980
and very soon you'll have the beginnings of a good collection on German East Africa, but by that time he's finished his book and he is now engaged in the history of the United Arab Emirates, and there is no more interest in that collection.

48:39.041 --> 48:48.252
And then, to talk that up, if you are a really good librarian,

48:48.620 --> 49:00.192
you're involved not only with what the faculty want right now, but things that the faculty will not even know that they want until 15 years from now.

49:01.033 --> 49:06.339
And this is why you do have to cultivate the private collective.

49:06.359 --> 49:15.268
Now, too often we think of book collectors in terms of wealthy men who can buy Shakespeare's first folios,

49:15.451 --> 49:20.097
or illuminated medieval manuscripts.

49:20.117 --> 49:21.339
Well, that's fine.

49:21.439 --> 49:27.488
It was a wonderful day, for instance, when Jim Babb opened up a letter from E.J.

49:27.548 --> 49:31.934
Beinecke, which said, in closed, you will find a check for $200,000.

49:32.394 --> 49:36.420
I do not want any nonsense about your setting this up as a fund.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.763
You are to spend this.

49:38.843 --> 49:39.644
That's fine.

49:39.764 --> 49:43.129
But when you consider

49:43.767 --> 49:50.233
I'm blowing my own horn here, but this is the kind of collecting that I know best.

49:50.934 --> 49:55.799
Even someone on a librarian's salary can collect books.

49:56.459 --> 50:06.929
Now, you're going to find time and again that you get started on a collection and suddenly you get priced out of the market.

50:07.430 --> 50:09.572
At one point, for example,

50:09.890 --> 50:18.483
I was collecting the Victorian novelist George MacDonald, whom you may know as the writer at the back of the North Pole.

50:20.326 --> 50:24.051
He wrote 20 or 30 more novels.

50:24.132 --> 50:25.113
He wrote poetry.

50:26.335 --> 50:28.959
He was a minister, wrote sermons.

50:29.860 --> 50:37.011
But I was buying three-volume first editions of his books from English booksellers,

50:37.328 --> 50:48.979
for three pounds, which at that time would have been about seven dollars and a half, or if the book fellow was being ritzy, three guineas, which added another 75 cents to it.

50:49.840 --> 51:07.116
And then all of a sudden, Victorian fiction became the rave, and books that I paid seven dollars and a half for all of a sudden were 175 dollars, and I never did manage to finish a collection of George McDonnell's.

51:07.552 --> 51:37.170
uh if the first thing of course it has to be a subject that interests you personally or you will not pursue it with enthusiasm if you're collecting with a library in mind and you know space is limited uh in our homes and so for for 20 years at least every collection that i have ever made has had a college library in mind most required uh so you need

51:37.488 --> 52:04.727
a collection which will not only interest you but is worth making from the point of view of this having some value as research or potential research material to students and faculty and then it has to be a subject that the book collecting world has not caught up with yet so that for a while at least you can have the feel to yourself

52:05.078 --> 52:21.754
And so what it means is that you have all the pleasure of grubbing around in antiquarian bookshops among books that are not important enough to attract the attention of wealthy collectors.

52:22.635 --> 52:33.465
And if you then can put in the time and effort, you can form a worthwhile collection, the biggest one that I ever did.

52:33.698 --> 52:37.963
one that Nick mentioned, American social fiction.

52:38.123 --> 52:45.852
Some of you remember that during the war there was such a thing as editions for the armed forces, those paperback records.

52:45.872 --> 52:50.077
And I read many of those on transports in the Pacific.

52:50.097 --> 52:53.421
And there were two of them that particularly caught my attention.

52:54.102 --> 53:00.229
One was a novel by William Worcester Haynes called Slim about construction linemen.

53:00.580 --> 53:19.706
Well, I was a beginning graduate student in history when the war broke out, and it struck me, reading this novel, that here was an aspect of American labor history that would be impossible to document anywhere, perhaps, except in this novel.

53:20.447 --> 53:26.014
Construction linemen do not keep diaries or write treatises on their work.

53:26.568 --> 53:36.621
The other one was a novel about the old, old Navy called Delilah, and it was about a destroyer on Philippine Station around 1914.

53:37.141 --> 53:53.782
And the important thing about it was that it essentially was concerned with what relations among enlisted men, among officers, and between officers and enlisted men were like in that old Navy of the great white fleet.

53:53.802 --> 53:56.085
It's the only place I have ever seen

53:56.487 --> 54:25.431
uh where this subject is handled by somebody who knew what he was talking about and so when i was looking for a field to collect and i started collecting books about trades occupations and professions and that went on to include that business and industry and then also regions or locality now

54:25.867 --> 54:41.491
Actually, I have first become interested in American utopian fiction of the 19th century, but since Lyle Wright published his three-volume bibliography of 19th century American fiction, all the prices went up.

54:41.872 --> 54:49.022
One of the bookseller can say, write free number so-and-so, then you can add $15 to the price.

54:49.583 --> 54:53.950
There hadn't been any bibliography for the first part of the 20th century.

54:54.436 --> 55:10.380
So I went through Publishers Weekly week by week for the 50 years of the century and tried to guess from the blurbs of which novels actually fitted my field and came up with about 2,000 titles.

55:10.960 --> 55:18.211
By the time my bibliography finally got published six years ago, it was up to 3,900 titles.

55:19.513 --> 55:23.599
So far, I have managed to find and turn over to Sue

55:23.866 --> 55:45.317
about 2,600 of those 3,900 titles, and I think that the most that I paid for any one of them, and that was under protest, but because I knew I wouldn't ever be able to find it for 50 cents, I think I paid $25, at least for a few of them.

55:45.753 --> 55:52.380
But many of them I found on 50-cent shelves outside bookshops.

55:53.501 --> 56:04.151
And now, of course, it's getting harder because Lyle Wright's bibliography is going to be continued to cover the first 25 years of this century.

56:06.413 --> 56:13.060
So there probably will be some of the 3,900 I'm never going to be able to find for Clark.

56:13.293 --> 56:15.195
You can do this.

56:16.777 --> 56:29.491
You can really help build your college library, provide material for future generations if you're willing.

56:30.733 --> 56:37.360
You need simply enthusiasm and a certain amount of time, and I should warn you,

56:37.745 --> 56:42.831
The best books are always either on the top shelf or the bottom shelf.

56:42.851 --> 56:49.939
And I am now getting too old to lie flat on the floor to see what's on the bottom shelf.

56:50.380 --> 56:56.667
Briefly, this is one of the great examples of how a collection is really greater than its individual parts.

56:57.068 --> 57:07.600
Taken individually, some of these books perhaps are $50 books, or $1 books, but taken as 3,900 titles reflecting one sensibility, one focus,

57:07.715 --> 57:13.782
You have a very important collection and an archive that is useful in an institution like Clark.

57:14.162 --> 57:25.114
We're kind of running out of time, but we certainly would be happy to take some questions if anybody has anything they would like to ask either of our distinguished guests.

57:27.257 --> 57:32.102
I didn't preface our comments earlier by saying that we would do this.

57:32.386 --> 57:35.729
But it is 3.30 in any case, so I'll turn it back to you.

57:36.070 --> 57:45.398
Well, I just want to thank both of our students.

57:45.418 --> 58:00.773
Just a personal note, it makes me very proud to be a graduate of Clark University when I think of the achievements of men like Archie Hanna and Steve Brown.

58:01.782 --> 58:03.928
I'd like to invite you.
