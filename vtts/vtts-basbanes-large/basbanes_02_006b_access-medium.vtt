00:02.528 --> 00:14.127
William Shakespeare taught us that the little world of the heart is vaster, deeper, and richer than the spaces of astronomy.

00:17.412 --> 00:18.274
I'm Robert McNeil.

00:19.135 --> 00:27.068
A hundred years ago, those words by Ralph Waldo Emerson inspired two Americans to devote their lives to collecting materials on Shakespeare.

00:27.487 --> 00:33.537
The result is the Folger Library in Washington, D.C., one of the greatest living monuments to William Shakespeare.

00:35.340 --> 00:40.068
Henry Clay Folger was a businessman who rose to become chairman of Standard Oil of New York.

00:40.810 --> 00:44.256
His wife, Emily Jordan Folger, was a Shakespearean scholar.

00:45.337 --> 00:49.765
Together, quietly, single-mindedly, they pursued their passion for collecting.

00:52.715 --> 01:02.926
Henry Folger said, I did think of placing the library at Stratford near the bones of the great man himself, but I finally concluded I would give it to Washington, for I am an American.

01:10.475 --> 01:14.800
When it opened in 1932, the magnitude of the Folger's achievement emerged.

01:16.381 --> 01:19.224
The library is an unparalleled resource for scholars.

01:20.546 --> 01:22.468
The range of the collection is enormous,

01:23.140 --> 01:26.084
The letters of John Donne.

01:26.104 --> 01:28.928
Books from the Italian Renaissance and the German Reformation.

01:28.948 --> 01:33.975
A 1478 edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

01:34.676 --> 01:41.525
In all, a collection covering every field of human endeavor in England and Europe from 1450 to 1700.

01:41.625 --> 01:47.393
But the heart of the collection is the works of Shakespeare.

01:49.010 --> 01:56.759
Perhaps the most valuable single item is this 1594 edition of Titus Andronicus, the only copy known to exist.

01:58.300 --> 02:04.527
These are called first folios, or the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays, dated 1623.

02:04.627 --> 02:10.074
The Folger Library has 79 copies of the first folio edition.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.997
The British Museum has the second largest collection.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.038
It has five.

02:14.761 --> 02:41.258
works like the tempest would have been lost if shakespeare's fellow actors hadn't published this folio edition seven years after he died to keep the plays alive kiss the book not only a center for scholars the folger library brings the wonder of shakespeare to the public this is a very shallow monster through its theater its music and its exhibits

02:44.242 --> 02:55.399
The Folger Shakespeare Library affirms Henry Folger's belief that Shakespeare and his world are a fundamental part of America's heritage, with a relevance for all men and all time.

03:10.742 --> 03:11.143
Thank you very much.

03:12.541 --> 03:15.245
I'm glad you found bits of Romeo and Juliet amusing.

03:15.265 --> 03:23.517
When I played Romeo at Stratford-upon-Avon, we used to get about 24 laughs during the balcony scene.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.700
No, but they were intentional laughs on our part.

03:25.720 --> 03:31.688
There are all sorts of unsuspected laughs in Shakespeare, and I think you've got to be a bit of a comedian to get away with Hamlet.

03:31.788 --> 03:34.472
I even got some laughs in Macbeth.

03:36.335 --> 03:42.143
Just 40 years after Shakespeare died, there was a very keen theatre-goer keeping a diary.

03:43.203 --> 03:55.441
And that diary has fixed some actors' performances, and here it is, an extract from it, Mr. Samuel Pepys.

03:55.461 --> 04:07.860
To the King's Theatre, and there saw Taming of the Shrew, which hath some very good pieces in it, but generally is but a mean play.

04:08.785 --> 04:16.236
by reason of the words, I suppose, not being understood, at least by me.

04:17.998 --> 04:28.093
To the opera, and there saw Romeo and Juliet, which is a play of itself the worst I ever heard in my life, and the worst acted that I ever saw these people do.

04:29.495 --> 04:38.708
To the Duke's house, and there saw a midsummer night's dream which I had never seen before.

04:39.937 --> 04:41.639
more shall ever again.

04:43.621 --> 04:50.008
But to be fair to Shakespeare and to Pepys, probably the version of the dream that he was seeing was called The Fairy Queen.

04:50.568 --> 04:54.492
It was by Thomas Betterton and had music by Henry Purcell.

04:55.033 --> 05:04.963
You see, even as early as 40 years after Shakespeare's death, theatre people were using Shakespeare for their own purposes, which has continued ever since.

05:04.984 --> 05:08.307
Although Shakespeare is for all time, he is for all time because each generation

05:08.573 --> 05:09.895
find something new in him.

05:10.516 --> 05:26.757
And in the 18th century, who thought, I think, perhaps, that Elizabethan tragedy was a little too messy an art form for their sense of order and taste, Nahum Tate provided a King Lear by Shakespeare in which the old king survived to see Cordelia happily married to Edgar.

05:27.658 --> 05:30.262
And they lived happily ever after right through the 18th century.

05:31.423 --> 05:35.188
The greatest English actor of that time was David Garrick.

05:35.995 --> 05:37.657
great tragedian, great comedian.

05:37.897 --> 05:39.638
He played Nahum Tate's version of King Lear.

05:40.800 --> 05:47.586
He was the actor-manager who brought professional actors back to Stratford-upon-Avon when he had the first festival there in 1764.

05:48.827 --> 06:00.238
And his biographer records for us that, happily for the lovers of Shakespeare, Mr. Garrick restored Macbeth to us in almost the same dress it was left us by the author.

06:00.258 --> 06:05.783
A speech or two which were not conducive to the action he threw out

06:07.298 --> 06:10.182
Scenes that were too long he judiciously pruned.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.347
Very few additions were made.

06:14.428 --> 06:30.992
Although he did compose a pretty long speech for Macbeth when dying, but Mr. Garrick excelled in the convulsive throes and dying agonies and would lose no opportunity to express that skill in that part of his profession.

06:31.012 --> 06:33.455
Tis done!

06:33.475 --> 06:36.900
The scene of life will quickly close

06:37.319 --> 06:42.647
Ambitions, vain, delusive dreams, a flame.

06:43.990 --> 06:50.460
And now I wake to darkness, guilt, and horror.

06:52.563 --> 06:53.525
I cannot bear it.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.648
Let me shake it off.

06:58.345 --> 07:03.293
It will not be my soul is clogged with blood and cannot rise.

07:03.413 --> 07:05.917
I dare not ask for mercy.

07:07.580 --> 07:21.061
Hell drags me down.

07:21.081 --> 07:21.822
I sink.

07:26.020 --> 07:26.861
I sink.

07:27.902 --> 07:34.510
Oh, my soul's lost forever.

07:50.309 --> 07:50.590
Thank you.

07:50.610 --> 07:51.451
Alas, poor Garrick.

07:52.011 --> 07:52.652
Thank you.

07:54.623 --> 07:59.470
The 20th century, of course, has continued to use or abuse Shakespeare for its own purposes.

08:00.893 --> 08:03.476
Edward Bond wrote his version of Lear.

08:03.537 --> 08:06.361
Bertil Brecht, his of Coriolanus, so did John Osborne.

08:06.902 --> 08:11.268
And where would Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern be without Shakespeare's Hamlet?

08:11.649 --> 08:18.199
But that's okay with me, because we know Shakespeare in his own turn had borrowed, is that the polite word, other people's plots for his own.

08:18.219 --> 08:20.142
You know, there'd been the King Lear before he wrote his.

08:20.182 --> 08:22.926
There'd been a Hamlet play and a play about King Henry V.

08:24.847 --> 08:29.674
The 20th century's great contribution to this sort of Shakespeareana has been the Shakespearean musical.

08:31.096 --> 08:33.299
West Side Story is really Romeo and Juliet.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.564
Kiss Me Kate is Taming of the Shrew.

08:37.085 --> 08:38.307
Catch My Soul is Othello.

08:40.310 --> 08:42.133
Boys from Syracuse is Comedy of Errors.

08:42.193 --> 08:45.317
Two Gentlemen of Verona is Two Gentlemen of Verona.

08:46.799 --> 08:49.343
Opera too, Othello, Falstaff, Midsummer Night's Dream.

08:51.006 --> 08:54.651
And ballet, Romeo and Juliet, and even Hamlet.

08:56.453 --> 09:15.454
When Robert Heltman was preparing his ballet of Hamlet, he met another giant of the theatre, Donald Wulfit, who was the last of the great actor-managers who used to tour Britain acting Shakespeare in large theatres, large voice, large gesture, sawing the air too much with his hand, perhaps.

09:15.514 --> 09:23.203
And Donald Wulfit met Robert Heltman in, let us say, the Garrick Club in London and asked him

09:24.938 --> 09:28.141
What are you working at, Bobby, old boy?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.648
Oh, I'm rehearsing my ballet of Hamlet, Donald.

09:38.872 --> 09:41.675
You are going to dance, Hamlet?

09:47.701 --> 09:48.402
Why not, Donald?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.883
You've been singing it for years.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.002
No, no, no, no, no, don't stop.

10:03.205 --> 10:11.915
There's another story from the Garrick Club of an actor recently preparing his own King Lear and asking Sir John Gielgud had he got any tips on playing the part.

10:11.935 --> 10:14.237
Yes, said Gielgud, get a small Cordelia.

10:16.059 --> 10:18.441
Ho, ho, ho.

10:21.425 --> 10:26.670
What is it, you suppose, which connects Richard Burbage, David Garrick, Donald Woolford, John Gielgud and...

10:27.325 --> 10:32.594
other actors like me who managed to earn a living by acting in Shakespeare's plays.

10:32.854 --> 10:50.262
I think it's an undying affection and belief that Shakespeare, more than any other writer who ever lived, understood the complexities of human life, the variety of human beings, and the subtleties that go to make up

10:50.798 --> 10:51.539
our existence.

10:51.800 --> 11:00.833
And for me, those complexities cannot be expressed by the actor unless he has fully understood them in the verse in which they are expressed on the page.

11:01.234 --> 11:06.181
And I thought I'd like to let you into a few of the secrets which I unlocked when I was preparing Macbeth.

11:07.663 --> 11:11.549
And I want to take a speech which is now famous.

11:13.292 --> 11:18.139
But let me first read it in perhaps the accent it was first pronounced

11:18.592 --> 11:21.179
the very first audience who ever heard it in Elizabethan England.

11:21.901 --> 11:26.012
Accents like clothes have fashions and sounds change.

11:26.513 --> 11:28.799
It may have sounded something like this.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.005
She should have died hereafter.

11:32.329 --> 11:34.575
Thou would have been a team for such a war.

11:35.365 --> 11:43.779
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pierce from dear to dear to the last syllable of recorded time.

11:44.359 --> 11:49.688
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.731
Oot, oot, brief candle.

11:52.172 --> 12:00.165
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and threats his oar upon the stage and then is hard no more.

12:00.205 --> 12:02.689
It is a tale told by an idiot.

12:03.277 --> 12:08.004
full of soon and fury, signifying nothing.

12:09.646 --> 12:16.076
But we can't... Oh, please.

12:16.096 --> 12:21.584
Each speech must be put in the context not only of the scene, but in the context of the whole play.

12:21.624 --> 12:28.795
So young Macbeth arrives back from battle, having single-handedly almost saved Scotland from defeat.

12:29.365 --> 12:33.730
and, like many another successful general, wants to go into professional politics.

12:34.791 --> 12:47.166
He meets three witches who promise him that he can be king of Scotland if only he will kill the present king, Duncan, the good old man, his patron and friend, and urged on by his wife.

12:47.927 --> 12:57.718
He commits the murder, and then there starts the reign of terror, which sends good men into exile, and at this point, at the end of the play, the good men are returning with troops to surround Macbeth,

12:57.985 --> 13:01.389
besieged in his castle where he is bereft of friends and troops.

13:01.469 --> 13:08.598
And at this point, a lone supporter arrives to give him the news that the Queen, my lord, is dead.

13:08.638 --> 13:13.904
And the simplicity of those monosyllables is carried on in the speech which follows.

13:13.944 --> 13:21.633
There is not, I think, in this speech a single word that a child of five, knowing English, couldn't understand.

13:21.673 --> 13:26.018
Macbeth says she should have died hereafter.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.082
She had to die sometime.

13:28.884 --> 13:42.108
At that point, in the little theatre where we first did Macbeth, the other actor would leave the stage, leaving the bare wooden platform such as this, for me to communicate directly with the audience who were around it as you are now.

13:43.230 --> 13:50.723
And I picked someone in the audience with my eye and said, there would have been a time for such a word.

13:52.508 --> 13:53.530
There would have been a time.

13:54.251 --> 13:59.740
Her speech is about time, Macbeth's position in time, and indeed our position too.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.424
There would have been a time for such a word.

14:02.444 --> 14:02.945
What word?

14:02.985 --> 14:05.929
Is that word searching back to the Queen?

14:05.989 --> 14:06.871
Dead?

14:07.472 --> 14:07.852
Died?

14:07.993 --> 14:08.453
Hereafter?

14:08.473 --> 14:11.518
No, I think it's leading on with the tripping of the rhythm of the line.

14:11.558 --> 14:18.870
There would have been a time for such a word, like the ticking of a clock leads on to the next word, which is tomorrow.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.584
And immediately the vowels lengthen and the rhythm slows up.

14:23.465 --> 14:25.648
And tomorrow.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.492
As the repetition of the future.

14:28.552 --> 14:31.816
As a bleak desert of repetitions.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.600
And tomorrow.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.262
You know, if you say a word often enough.

14:36.282 --> 14:41.649
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

14:41.669 --> 14:42.670
What does the word mean?

14:42.751 --> 14:43.792
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

14:43.812 --> 14:44.633
It has no meaning.

14:45.114 --> 14:48.418
As life is beginning to lose its meaning for Macbeth.

14:50.356 --> 14:54.883
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

14:54.963 --> 14:58.569
Today, we've had tomorrow, we've got today.

14:58.589 --> 15:00.832
Two elements of time.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.617
And here's the first image, the first metaphor of the speech.

15:03.877 --> 15:07.262
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

15:07.322 --> 15:10.968
That's how the future is proceeding as far as Macbeth can see.

15:11.509 --> 15:18.760
It's the picture here, what, of someone creeping, not with a grandiligant stride, but a little petty pace.

15:19.178 --> 15:20.740
along an Elizabethan street.

15:22.503 --> 15:27.029
There's something mean about it, as there is something mean about life for Macbeth.

15:29.072 --> 15:30.113
How long does this go on?

15:30.193 --> 15:33.999
It goes on to the last syllable of recorded time.

15:34.019 --> 15:35.981
That's how far the tomorrows are going to stretch.

15:36.202 --> 15:45.455
Not to the last word, but to the last syllable of the last word, when the big bang comes and the world ends and all the clocks stop and time is no longer recorded.

15:45.515 --> 15:46.536
What records time?

15:47.663 --> 16:10.971
clocks and bells, syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays we've had tomorrow we've had today we've now got yesterday is the full complex of time and Macbeth is in that time not only he is but we are all our yesterdays you're beginning to being drawn into Macbeth's predicament

16:11.255 --> 16:13.698
is willing you into it by referring to you.

16:13.738 --> 16:16.180
And what have all our collective experience done?

16:16.221 --> 16:17.962
What's the whole of human experience been about?

16:18.443 --> 16:24.870
It has lighted fools the way to dusty death.

16:24.890 --> 16:27.913
That's what all of our common experience has been about.

16:28.774 --> 16:36.503
Holding up a light, a lantern, a candle to light fools who are going along with petty pace

16:36.938 --> 16:43.367
Village idiots, those sort of fools who tumble into the dust of the unmade road of Elizabethan England.

16:44.949 --> 16:46.331
Fool, of course, has another meaning.

16:46.812 --> 16:47.853
Professional entertainer.

16:48.154 --> 16:48.654
Festy.

16:49.355 --> 16:50.176
King Lear's fool.

16:51.118 --> 16:54.182
Professional stage will be important in a minute, I think, in the speech.

16:55.784 --> 16:57.006
Out, out.

16:57.026 --> 16:57.987
Brief candle.

17:01.132 --> 17:02.113
Try and put a candle out.

17:02.514 --> 17:02.674
Out.

17:04.677 --> 17:04.797
Out.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.199
You have to do it twice, don't you?

17:06.219 --> 17:06.439
Brief.

17:06.824 --> 17:34.198
candle life isn't some wonderful roman candle it's not something casting incandescence throughout the universe it's a brief candle it's a penny candle it's the thing you keep in the kitchen drawer for emergencies the cheapest thing in your house Macbeth is saying that's what life is like and that candle has even gone out life he says is but a walking shadow it's not even the candle it's not even it has no substance it's a shadow

17:34.381 --> 17:36.504
There's a phrase in the theatre, walking gentleman.

17:36.564 --> 17:38.227
He's the meanest member of any company.

17:38.768 --> 17:41.292
He plays any old part and gets paid the least amount of money.

17:41.312 --> 17:44.477
Life isn't even a walking gentleman, he's a walking shadow.

17:44.517 --> 17:51.007
And yes, Macbeth is thinking of actors because his next phrase is a poor player.

17:52.049 --> 18:01.063
Life is a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.

18:02.849 --> 18:09.501
What life is like an actor, says Macbeth, being played by McKellen, who is an actor.

18:09.700 --> 18:17.570
Life is like me that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, which is what I've been doing all evening during acting Shakespeare.

18:18.130 --> 18:22.035
And then it's heard no more when I go behind the curtain and have never seen again.

18:22.156 --> 18:23.297
I vanish from your sight.

18:23.637 --> 18:25.099
I've been strutting and fretting.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.442
What a way to earn a living, Macbeth is saying.

18:27.502 --> 18:29.064
How despicable acting is.

18:29.445 --> 18:33.089
And Mackellan, who's an actor, is saying that even as he is Macbeth.

18:34.291 --> 18:39.437
And if Macbeth thinks that Mackellan is wasting his time being an actor, what the hell do you think you're doing watching me?

18:40.868 --> 19:01.315
And it's in that way that Shakespeare and Macbeth bring you in to the present tense and don't allow you to think of Macbeth as just a fairy story, something that doesn't really belong to you, because it is Mackellan's predicament and therefore yours, because we are bound together, audience and actor, on a stage.

19:02.536 --> 19:07.182
Life is a tale, a fairy tale, Arabian Nights tale.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.707
It's a tale told by an idiot.

19:12.762 --> 19:13.403
Tomorrow.

19:14.865 --> 19:15.667
Tomorrow.

19:16.287 --> 19:20.554
And tomorrow, says the village idiot going along the little country lane with petty things.

19:20.574 --> 19:22.097
Tomorrow.

19:23.439 --> 19:24.460
Tomorrow.

19:25.802 --> 19:26.904
Tomorrow.

19:27.084 --> 19:36.559
Full of sound and fury, signifying the blackest, blankest word in the English language

19:37.737 --> 19:45.126
conveying the total emptiness of Macbeth's vision and Macbeth's future and Macbeth's hope.

19:47.409 --> 19:47.849
Nothing.

19:49.671 --> 19:55.098
There is no more pessimistic view of human life than Macbeth has reached at that point in the play.

19:55.158 --> 19:59.643
And me playing Macbeth is not enough for me to come out with some generalized despair.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.045
It must be as particular as

20:01.379 --> 20:21.602
that analysis which I've just given you, not so that I can give a university lecture when I'm acting the part, but so that during rehearsal and in the performance, containing all those ideas in my head, I can filter them through the rest of an actor's accoutrements, my hands, my arms, my legs, my body, my face, my voice.

20:23.965 --> 20:29.631
And like a pianist who appears not only to be putting the music into the piano, but also taking it out,

20:30.134 --> 20:43.469
I am not only Macbeth, I am, in a sense, the man who wrote Macbeth, and it's my privilege in acting Shakespeare for occasionally to understand what it's like to have been Shakespeare.

20:45.852 --> 20:59.567
And now, with your help and imagination, let me put Macbeth's last soliloquy up against others that he has in the play, put it into the context of Macbeth returning from battle, the golden boy, and from that height,

21:00.070 --> 21:02.513
of ecstasy and achievement and optimism.

21:03.495 --> 21:06.438
He falls deeper and deeper and deeper.

21:06.479 --> 21:14.710
Always his imagination alive, always thinking and wondering the pros and cons, the rights and wrongs.

21:15.531 --> 21:20.357
Macbeth's tragedy is that he is a murderer with a conscience.

21:31.829 --> 21:34.994
This supernatural soliciting cannot be ill, cannot be good.

21:37.078 --> 21:40.444
If ill, why has it given me earnest of success, commencing in the truth?

21:42.868 --> 21:50.220
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature?

21:52.244 --> 21:56.290
Present fears are less than horrible imaginings.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.853
My thought, whose murder yet

21:58.171 --> 22:10.232
is but fantastical shakes, so my single state of magnet function is smothered in some eyes, and nothing is but what is not.

22:10.252 --> 22:13.418
If chance will have me king, why chance may crown me without my stir.

22:15.621 --> 22:20.550
Come what, come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest days.

22:25.930 --> 22:29.155
If it were done when it is done, then, too well, it were done quickly.

22:29.175 --> 22:46.302
If the assassination could tremble up the consequence and catch with his success, that but this blow might be the be-all and the end-all here, but here, upon this bank and shoal of time, we'd jump the life to count.

22:49.184 --> 22:56.873
but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instruction which being taught returns to plague the inventor.

22:56.913 --> 23:01.478
This even-handed justice commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice to our own lips.

23:04.822 --> 23:16.035
He's here in double trust, first as I am his kinsman and his subject, strong both against the deed, then as his host, who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself.

23:20.538 --> 23:46.090
This Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off, and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast, or heaven's cherry have been horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air, will blow the horrid deed in every eye, the tears will drown the wind.

23:51.858 --> 24:02.507
I have no spur to prick the side of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other.

24:16.199 --> 24:21.223
Is this a dagger which has seen before me

24:27.380 --> 24:31.945
the handle toward my hand.

24:31.965 --> 24:35.448
God, let me clutch thee.

24:35.468 --> 24:39.052
Perhaps thee not.

24:39.072 --> 24:40.253
And yet I see thee still.

24:42.435 --> 24:50.223
Art thou not fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight, or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?

24:52.385 --> 24:55.648
I see thee still in form as palpable as this which now I draw.

24:56.152 --> 24:59.378
Thou marshals me the way that I was going and such an instrument I was to use.

24:59.418 --> 25:01.462
Mine eyes are made the fools of the other senses.

25:03.105 --> 25:05.209
What else worth all the rest?

25:05.229 --> 25:07.813
I see thee still and on thy blade of the dungeon.

25:08.955 --> 25:11.460
Guts of blood which was not so before.

25:21.143 --> 25:23.725
There's no such thing.

25:23.746 --> 25:28.010
It is the bloody business which informs thus to my house.

25:28.030 --> 25:31.453
Now, the one-half world, nature seems dead.

25:34.856 --> 25:37.959
And wicked dreams abuse the curtain's sleep.

25:39.220 --> 25:49.210
Witchcraft celibates pale Hecate's offerings and withered murder, alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf, whose house is watched thus with his stealthy pace.

25:50.759 --> 25:59.010
The Tarquin's ravishing strides toward his design moves like the ghosts.

25:59.030 --> 26:03.476
Thou sure and firm-set earth, fear not my steps which where they walk.

26:04.457 --> 26:12.227
For fear thy very stones prate of my whereabouts, and take this present horror from the time which now suits with it.

26:17.135 --> 26:20.299
As I threat, he lives words to the heat of deeds.

26:20.399 --> 26:23.362
Too cold breath gives I go.

26:25.004 --> 26:26.727
And it is done.

26:26.747 --> 26:28.208
The bell invites me.

26:30.351 --> 26:36.318
Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to help me.

26:36.378 --> 26:37.079
All to help.

26:44.488 --> 26:46.230
You have scoffed the snake, not killed it.

26:49.433 --> 26:53.799
She'll close and be herself as our poor mammoth remains in danger of her former tooth.

26:55.121 --> 27:06.578
But let the frame of things disjoint and both the world suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly.

27:08.641 --> 27:15.812
Better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the blind to lie in restless ecstasy.

27:17.446 --> 27:20.070
Duncan is in his grave after life's fitful fever.

27:20.110 --> 27:21.272
He sleeps well.

27:21.292 --> 27:33.669
No steel, no poison, malice, domestic, foreign levy, nothing to touch him forever.

27:33.689 --> 27:38.897
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.

27:41.999 --> 27:50.310
The time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night shriek, and my fell of hair would, at a dismal treatise, rouse and stir as life were in it.

27:50.450 --> 28:02.887
I've supped full with horrors, direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts, cannot once start me.

28:02.907 --> 28:04.008
Wherefore was that cry?

28:05.811 --> 28:07.433
The queen, my lord, is dead.

28:10.703 --> 28:12.225
They should have died hereafter.

28:19.355 --> 28:22.180
There would have been a time for such a word.

28:22.380 --> 28:23.121
Tomorrow.

28:26.345 --> 28:27.928
And tomorrow.

28:30.231 --> 28:34.057
And tomorrow.

28:34.077 --> 28:40.626
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day till the last

28:40.876 --> 28:42.998
syllable of recorded time.

28:45.200 --> 28:51.045
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

28:51.065 --> 28:53.187
Out, out, brief cattle.

28:56.811 --> 28:59.733
Life's but a walking shadow.

29:02.676 --> 29:06.560
A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage.

29:08.602 --> 29:10.123
And then is heard no more.

29:12.280 --> 29:33.082
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

29:33.102 --> 29:36.185
Our revels now are ended.

29:36.205 --> 29:40.009
These actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits.

29:41.052 --> 29:59.618
and are vanished into air, into thin air, and like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yeah, all which it inherits shall dissolve, and like this insubstantial pageant faded.
