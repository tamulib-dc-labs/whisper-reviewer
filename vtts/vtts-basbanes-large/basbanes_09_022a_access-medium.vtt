WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:03.624
What, and Parade?

00:03.644 --> 00:05.226
Excuse me?

00:05.726 --> 00:07.688
And Parade.

00:07.949 --> 00:09.811
And Parade.

00:10.231 --> 00:11.232
And Parade.

00:11.292 --> 00:12.113
There's a range.

00:16.457 --> 00:17.398
But really, I didn't know that.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.581
You mean, the New York Review of Books and the New Yorker don't have the same material?

00:21.202 --> 00:22.163
Well, I haven't noticed it.

00:22.183 --> 00:22.764
I mean, they may have.

00:22.784 --> 00:27.068
It just never came to my attention that they both have the same books.

00:27.807 --> 00:31.611
do that would have material enough for both, but the kind of thing that I don't know what is there.

00:31.632 --> 00:40.202
It's really excerpted for anything long, you know, and Hersey and... Truman Capote, Hersey and Truman Capote, and then a couple others.

00:40.522 --> 00:41.884
Oh, Rachel Carson.

00:41.904 --> 00:45.788
That's the other one I was trying to think of.

00:45.808 --> 00:48.251
I knew there was a woman in there somewhere.

00:48.271 --> 00:49.693
I've never done one like this before.

00:49.953 --> 00:52.316
It's a press conference.

00:52.436 --> 00:54.979
It's in between a press conference and an interview.

00:55.465 --> 00:59.929
I guess we'll decide generally.

00:59.989 --> 01:04.033
Did you see this book almost as a bookend to your executionist song in a way?

01:04.353 --> 01:06.155
Oh, Michael Gilmore's book you're talking about?

01:06.175 --> 01:06.815
No, your book.

01:06.835 --> 01:07.796
Your executionist.

01:07.936 --> 01:09.858
Oh, is this book a bookend?

01:09.878 --> 01:10.659
Kind of a bookend.

01:10.899 --> 01:11.379
I hope not.

01:11.560 --> 01:20.167
Well, in terms of joking, you know, Larry and I would sometimes call it an executionist song, too.

01:20.308 --> 01:21.409
Larry being Larry Schiller.

01:22.329 --> 01:25.152
And maybe because...

01:26.009 --> 01:33.800
I did have a very small joke with myself and maybe a few readers, which is the first line of this book is a little bit like the first line of the executioner song.

01:34.982 --> 01:39.509
The first line of the executioner song went something like, Linda was six when she fell out of the apple tree.

01:40.109 --> 01:45.577
And this book begins, I think, something like, Bahlia was three when she burned her face on the stove.

01:46.599 --> 01:51.085
And so that was sort of just the inside joke.

01:51.506 --> 01:55.712
But they're really, they're much alike in certain ways, but they're also different.

01:56.114 --> 02:02.080
in that I didn't see any attempt to try to argue that this was a novel, and I didn't want to push it to become a novel.

02:03.201 --> 02:13.052
With the execution I saw, I thought I really was on the cusp, and it was interesting to me to claim it was a novel, because I felt that there's a lot of misunderstanding of what a novel is.

02:13.492 --> 02:16.335
A novel finally is a way of attacking reality.

02:17.696 --> 02:19.178
It's your approach to reality.

02:19.979 --> 02:25.885
Nonfiction digests much more and feeds it back to the reader.

02:27.232 --> 02:30.256
Whereas in fiction, you try to create a presence.

02:30.637 --> 02:34.722
You try to create the life affair without judging it, letting the reader judge it.

02:34.782 --> 02:35.944
And that's a sizable difference.

02:36.625 --> 02:40.890
And my proof used to be with the executioner's song was that you could change the names of the characters.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.275
You called Harry Kilmore instead of Gary Gilmore.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.658
And people would say, well, it's a key novel.

02:46.718 --> 02:47.599
You know who the people are.

02:47.639 --> 02:48.941
Harry Kilmore is Gary Gilmore.

02:49.261 --> 02:50.944
But they wouldn't argue whether it was a novel or not.

02:51.244 --> 02:55.770
But you were trying to find, to determine, you were searching for a character out of a real personality.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.282
trying to determine what.

02:57.302 --> 03:07.557
Well, I wanted to portray him as a character in a novel rather than having long essays about the nature of the psychopath and so forth and so on and where Gary Gilmore emerged and what his movie was.

03:07.818 --> 03:08.979
I wanted to create it rather than.

03:09.841 --> 03:18.373
But with Oswald, I felt it was impossible because finally you can't make a fictional character out of Oswald.

03:18.854 --> 03:24.222
Well, John DeLillo did and did rather well with it, but you can't do it without

03:24.927 --> 03:26.669
changing a lot of the ways in which you're working.

03:28.571 --> 03:32.235
I don't know if I can put my finger on it a little bit.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.236
Maybe I'm not following it.

03:33.276 --> 03:35.438
You said you were trying to create a character with Gilmore?

03:35.458 --> 03:41.064
You were trying to create a character as opposed to delineating one that all of you... I wasn't trying to create a character who didn't exist.

03:41.084 --> 03:44.047
I was thinking of a real-life character and I was saying as close to it as I could.

03:44.247 --> 03:54.478
But I've always had this belief that in journalism, the closer you stay to the reality, no matter how close you stay to the reality, you're still going to be way off of necessity.

03:54.661 --> 04:00.991
So in a way, aren't you saying that maybe the line between fiction and nonfiction is not so thick as one might assume?

04:01.271 --> 04:03.294
Well, most people think it's a Berlin Wall.

04:03.395 --> 04:03.835
Absolutely.

04:03.935 --> 04:06.660
And I think, on the contrary, it's a barely marked boundary.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.862
And you've been toying with it for a while.

04:07.882 --> 04:10.586
And I love working back and forth on either side of the boundary.

04:10.926 --> 04:13.310
I like being a range rider on that line.

04:13.330 --> 04:19.279
If Executioner's Song were published this year, do you think they would still put it in the fiction shelves?

04:19.961 --> 04:21.563
Because at that point,

04:22.049 --> 04:36.257
the people who were out there on the edge like you were using non-fiction techniques, or using fiction techniques in non-fiction, and so therefore it could be defined as fiction because the techniques were those that weren't fiction.

04:36.277 --> 04:43.230
Well, there was a lot of argument at the time, but finally an author isn't tired of saying this book, or at least that was the working premise then, I assume it hasn't changed.

04:43.700 --> 04:49.127
But I just never felt this was fiction, the Oswald book.

04:49.147 --> 04:52.272
And it was something else, which is I was in a colloquy with the reader.

04:53.634 --> 04:55.416
That's the big difference between the two books.

04:55.436 --> 04:58.320
The second half of Oswald's tale, I'm talking to the reader all the time.

04:58.741 --> 05:00.723
I'm saying, here, I feel pretty sure of this stuff.

05:01.264 --> 05:03.707
And there, I don't really know what I'm talking about too well.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.790
And there's a lot of confusion there.

05:07.152 --> 05:10.797
We have to look at Oswald under three possibilities, three subheads.

05:11.218 --> 05:12.880
That's for instance when he's alone in Dallas,

05:13.366 --> 05:15.829
that period when nobody knows where he was for a couple of weeks.

05:16.710 --> 05:34.394
Either he's being trained as some sort of agent for some intelligence organization, or he's having a homosexual interlude, or he's just so sick of all the pressures he's been under for all these years that he's just holding up by himself so he can be alone and have time to think.

05:35.014 --> 05:39.981
These are three possibilities that occur to me, and I thought we really have to keep all three in mind as we move forward.

05:40.602 --> 05:51.015
Now, I found something interesting with that, that, you know, one of the reasons you write, you write for many reasons, but one of the reasons you write is to learn more about writing.

05:51.976 --> 05:59.185
And what I learned there is that you can do that and somehow the character becomes more alive.

06:00.607 --> 06:07.015
That is, in the actor giving him three possible motivations, all different, that didn't blur him.

06:07.687 --> 06:09.309
That rounded him in an odd way.

06:09.590 --> 06:11.212
And then I realized that's the way we look at all our friends.

06:12.073 --> 06:22.148
Most of the time, friends, mates, children, enemies, buddies, everybody, we look at them, we don't always think they're doing it for this reason.

06:22.989 --> 06:29.338
Sometimes we're saying they're doing it for reason A, or they're doing it for reason Z, or maybe they're doing it for some reason in the middle they haven't found yet.

06:29.498 --> 06:31.301
We must have the same friend.

06:31.321 --> 06:32.502
We must have the same group of friends.

06:34.065 --> 06:34.585
Yeah.

06:34.605 --> 06:35.787
So what I'm getting at, but that...

06:36.205 --> 06:37.727
It doesn't take away from the reality of our friends.

06:38.087 --> 06:41.231
It's just that we walk along with suppositions on people's natures all the time.

06:41.931 --> 06:46.597
And so I found that that sort of made him more comfortable in a paradoxical way.

06:47.638 --> 06:52.684
That because we're not saying he did this, and he did this, and he is this, but rather, what is he at this point?

06:52.724 --> 06:53.685
Who is he at this point?

06:54.446 --> 06:56.408
You get nearer, you get more interested in him.

06:56.428 --> 06:59.331
You get more of a sense of his three-dimensionality that way.

07:00.512 --> 07:04.677
I wanted to ask you about your association with Schiller.

07:05.078 --> 07:11.165
which I find fascinating, both from a reader's viewpoint and a writer's.

07:11.205 --> 07:15.129
I want to know, well, no, I wouldn't call him an assistant.

07:15.370 --> 07:16.231
No, no, he's like Hollywood.

07:16.251 --> 07:19.214
He's been, I mean, he was on Gilmore before you were, wasn't he?

07:19.234 --> 07:21.216
Oh, yeah, yeah, he was on Gilmore for quite a while.

07:21.296 --> 07:24.860
In fact, we weren't too friendly at that point.

07:24.961 --> 07:31.608
We'd worked together on Maryland, and we'd had a lot of fights because he was interested in the photographs and I was interested in the text.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.191
And we sort of,

07:35.420 --> 07:41.746
We negotiated with one another much of the time, and there were periods where we weren't even speaking to one another during Maryland.

07:42.647 --> 07:49.514
But then we worked on a small book together, which was better, called The Faith of Graffiti.

07:50.255 --> 07:55.681
And then on the Executionist song, he was in the thick of it.

07:55.701 --> 08:04.650
And I was just watching it on television, and I remember laughing with someone who knew him, and a former secretary of mine, and she said at one point,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.144
I think it's just going to be a few days before Mr. Schiller's on the phone.

08:08.825 --> 08:17.416
And sure enough, Larry called, and he said, listen, I'd like to, I've done an interview in Playboy, and I'd like you to read it.

08:18.057 --> 08:19.038
It's with Gary Gilmore.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.279
So I said, sure, and then I read it.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.521
It was a marvelous interview.

08:22.422 --> 08:24.124
So I said, I'd like to make a play out of that.

08:25.186 --> 08:29.271
And he said, well, if you want to make a play out of it, you've got to do the book first.

08:29.470 --> 08:31.253
So that's how we got into doing that.

08:31.273 --> 08:32.916
He had the rights locked up, didn't he?

08:32.936 --> 08:36.682
He had pretty many of the rights to those stories locked up very early on.

08:36.702 --> 08:38.264
With Gary Gilmore, yeah.

08:38.304 --> 08:39.086
He's very good at that.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.249
But he's not just a packager.

08:41.289 --> 08:42.271
He's a good journalist.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.293
He's a good interviewer.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.254
He's a very good interviewer.

08:44.274 --> 08:44.975
Very good interviewer.

08:44.995 --> 08:47.359
I can't say I was that impressed with the O.J.

08:47.379 --> 08:47.640
subscription.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.443
Well, this is what I was going to ask.

08:49.483 --> 08:51.606
What is this, a skid into the rhinestones?

08:51.626 --> 08:52.187
Forget it.

08:52.336 --> 08:54.218
I'll tell them that.

08:54.418 --> 09:00.526
No, that's what Life magazine said when Rita Hayworth married Dick Hames, a skid into the rhinestone.

09:00.666 --> 09:00.766
Oh.

09:02.568 --> 09:05.392
No, I think that was a job.

09:05.592 --> 09:07.094
Larry Larry got called to do it.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.399
And he, I think he enjoyed doing it.

09:11.639 --> 09:14.322
And, you know, he made a reasonable amount.

09:14.683 --> 09:16.124
Simpson did get most of the money there.

09:16.144 --> 09:18.347
It wasn't Larry that was, you know.

09:18.447 --> 09:20.329
Anyway, I don't want to get into that.

09:20.349 --> 09:21.651
It wasn't a job.

09:21.901 --> 09:24.425
But how do you work together?

09:24.605 --> 09:27.490
Do you divide up the interviews?

09:27.630 --> 09:29.993
No, we usually do interviews together.

09:30.014 --> 09:30.414
Technically, you do.

09:30.434 --> 09:32.778
He'll sometimes do an interview when I'm not around.

09:32.858 --> 09:35.863
He's a very hard worker.

09:38.587 --> 09:43.394
When we were over in Minsk, the interviews would take a long time because you had the English and the Russian.

09:45.157 --> 09:46.319
I've said this many times right now.

09:46.339 --> 09:49.123
It was an hour for the English and an hour for the Russian.

09:49.576 --> 09:58.404
But now I'm arguing with the translator, because one of the things we discovered is that you can't talk a certain way in the old Soviet Union.

09:58.804 --> 10:00.246
You really have to phrase your remarks.

10:00.926 --> 10:13.377
And so sometimes the translator, who was a very strong-minded young lady, would say, who parenthetically, she and Larry got married and divorced six months after we finished in Minsk.

10:13.517 --> 10:18.722
I have a question.

10:19.006 --> 10:21.549
It's really, I guess, what I'm... Wait, did I finish the point?

10:21.629 --> 10:22.990
Let me just finish that.

10:23.731 --> 10:28.115
I'm getting... I'm long-winded, but we'll cover this.

10:31.378 --> 10:33.861
Larry and I work together in interviews.

10:34.021 --> 10:34.902
We're all together different.

10:35.762 --> 10:37.084
So very often we collide.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.929
He'll be taking a line of questioning that irritates me, because I think it's the wrong line of questioning.

10:42.769 --> 10:44.631
And I'll cut across him or vice versa.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.593
And then we get angry at each other.

10:46.633 --> 10:47.494
Sometimes it's comic.

10:48.014 --> 10:54.542
because there's a poor Russian sitting there looking around bewildered, and a few of us are screaming at one another, you know, and that happened once or twice.

10:55.123 --> 10:58.467
But generally, what Larry does is he organizes the situation.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.850
For instance, we needed several translators, not one.

11:01.751 --> 11:05.315
We had a lot of documents on how to be translated that we're getting from the KGB and other people.

11:06.757 --> 11:08.299
We needed this, we needed that.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.902
So he organized an office over there in Minsk.

11:10.922 --> 11:14.967
And as I say, he's a very hard worker, so he'd be up early in the morning organizing the office,

11:15.470 --> 11:20.277
Then he'd be arranging interviews, and that very often involved filing people, which was 30 years later.

11:20.317 --> 11:23.441
Sometimes they were still in Minsk, sometimes they were in other places.

11:24.423 --> 11:27.407
And then, as I said, we'd do interviews together, and then we'd meet in the evening.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.910
There wasn't anything to do in Minsk except work.

11:29.930 --> 11:37.942
We'd meet in the evening, and we'd argue and discuss what we'd heard that day, because we had a lot of theories on what had happened.

11:38.763 --> 11:43.890
And slowly, over a period of time, I ended up with much less...

11:44.174 --> 11:45.916
conspiratorial material than I wanted.

11:46.877 --> 11:49.140
I mean, I was hoping to find more conspiratorial material.

11:49.540 --> 11:55.728
And the sad grim truth that kept beating in on us all the time is that the KGB was such a conservative organization.

11:55.888 --> 11:57.009
They were looking for the same thing.

11:57.029 --> 11:58.351
They were looking for conspiratorial material.

11:58.691 --> 12:00.273
They were looking for the same thing and didn't find it.

12:00.473 --> 12:01.555
And we were repeating it.

12:01.715 --> 12:06.280
And finally, we ended up believing them as we got to understand how conservative they were.

12:06.300 --> 12:12.848
I mean, the key thing to remember there is that not only was it a bureaucracy, but it was a bureaucracy which was very dangerous at the top.

12:13.334 --> 12:24.205
You know, before 1960, in the 30s, the 40s, and the 50s, the head of the KGB had been executed by Stalin.

12:24.225 --> 12:34.915
Now, it was a post-Stalinian period in 1960, but they had formed very deep habits of, don't put your name on a piece of paper that's going to become an embarrassing piece of paper.

12:34.935 --> 12:39.319
So when it came down to interviewing Oswald, in the beginning, I couldn't believe they didn't debrief him formally.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.223
But then as you get to know them, bit by bit, you know, they're very

12:43.540 --> 12:44.762
They're full of finesse.

12:44.782 --> 12:46.864
They prefer to go around three sides of a square.

12:47.065 --> 12:49.628
If they have to go from here to there, they'll go around this way.

12:49.808 --> 12:53.373
You've described them as being conservative, too, to your surprise.

12:53.553 --> 12:55.275
Yeah, very conservative sexually.

12:56.097 --> 12:58.620
You know, they really hated taking down sexual dialogue.

12:59.361 --> 12:59.621
Why?

12:59.641 --> 13:01.003
Because it irritated the higher-ups.

13:02.165 --> 13:13.159
It was a very... Slowly, what you're going to realize is that this evil empire was, in fact, just a sad...

13:13.713 --> 13:22.621
Third world country that was very depressed, had no real international force within itself.

13:23.202 --> 13:27.466
You know, they still have the ghost of the old threat, but there was none there.

13:27.566 --> 13:30.209
All they wanted was to live a little better.

13:31.370 --> 13:35.374
And so it, you know, it served such a mockery with the evil empire.

13:36.875 --> 13:40.679
Because one's ears was still ringing with Ronald Reagan and the evil empire.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.281
This empire hadn't been evil for 20 years.

13:44.273 --> 13:52.363
And the concluding lines of the book, you suggest quite pointedly that this is an American tragedy.

13:53.024 --> 14:00.634
Having said that and put that forth, are we to assume then that Lee Harvey Oswald is a tragic hero?

14:00.874 --> 14:08.003
And if so, what qualities does he have that makes him heroic and even admirable in some respects?

14:08.928 --> 14:19.478
I think he's a tragic figure, not a tragic hero.

14:20.258 --> 14:21.559
He's an anti-hero, if anything.

14:23.261 --> 14:24.102
What's an anti-hero?

14:24.542 --> 14:28.125
Someone who goes in for large ventures and makes a mess of them.

14:29.066 --> 14:30.668
I think that's one definition of an anti-hero.

14:31.308 --> 14:33.871
Someone who eats away at our notion of heroism.

14:34.591 --> 14:37.534
I think he wanted to be a hero, and he absolutely failed at that.

14:38.442 --> 14:42.386
Tragedy, however, does imply certain admirable qualities.

14:42.446 --> 14:47.510
And you are constantly in the book trying to see qualities.

14:47.830 --> 14:53.956
You are looking almost desperately for something there that's not, as you said, just a failure or a passing.

14:54.196 --> 14:56.098
Because, I mean, I think I'm connecting.

14:56.118 --> 14:56.658
I think we are.

14:57.579 --> 15:00.462
This is really the line I think we're interested in most about the book.

15:00.842 --> 15:03.104
It ramifies in a number of ways.

15:03.324 --> 15:06.407
What draws you to this book is in some ways you're writing against postmodernism.

15:06.893 --> 15:10.176
Hopefully I have, yes.

15:10.196 --> 15:11.318
I hate postmodernism.

15:11.538 --> 15:19.146
Right, and one of the things you say about it, I want to come back to that in other ways, but one of the things you say about it is it's got to do with antiheroes and smallness.

15:19.827 --> 15:25.252
So if you can invest him with some qualities that unionize him, then you vanquished at least some of postmodernism.

15:25.332 --> 15:26.353
All right, good, good.

15:26.373 --> 15:28.616
Let me, before I answer, I do want to answer this.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.458
And that ties in with what I said.

15:30.478 --> 15:32.580
Yeah, let me reverse it for a moment.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.483
What is the passion everyone has to have him small,

15:35.834 --> 15:39.059
and essentially meaningless and an identity.

15:39.479 --> 15:39.739
Why?

15:39.920 --> 15:49.894
Because I have found, you know, for instance, there was a fairly good review in the Sunday Times, New York Sunday Times, but then at the end, he says, but Mayer is dead wrong on his being a tragic figure.

15:50.054 --> 15:50.775
He's a cockroach.

15:52.357 --> 15:54.260
Well, you know, I started thinking, that's a passion there.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.925
You know, Tom Powers had a passion to believe Oswald is small.

15:58.806 --> 16:00.188
Now, I would say it

16:00.455 --> 16:04.539
I would ask all of you, why do you have the strong feeling that you don't want them bigger than?

16:04.759 --> 16:06.060
Let me try to answer that.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.722
I don't have that feeling.

16:07.782 --> 16:10.544
My gut feeling is I don't know who killed President Kennedy.

16:10.645 --> 16:16.750
And I think if you want to define postmodernism in a sentence, it's not knowing who killed your president 30 years later.

16:17.091 --> 16:18.852
Not really knowing in your gut, not being sure.

16:20.073 --> 16:22.496
So I feel like in some ways that may be what drew you.

16:22.536 --> 16:29.382
If you could get to the core of that question, maybe you could put to rest all of the kinds of uncertainty that's spread out from it, that's spawned from it.

16:31.336 --> 16:39.627
All right, well, let's go back, because I'm not sure I can answer you there.

16:39.647 --> 16:42.691
I'm not sure that was my motive.

16:42.711 --> 16:43.392
What was your motive?

16:43.432 --> 16:44.453
What drew you to Oswald?

16:44.493 --> 16:47.116
You said the Belarus KGB contacted you.

16:47.137 --> 16:48.498
Well, I had mixed motives.

16:48.618 --> 16:55.127
First of all, not all my motives were honorable in relation to I'm going to write this book, and this book is enormously important to me.

16:55.668 --> 17:00.634
I had secondary motives, and one of them was to learn more about the KGB, because I wanted that for Hornet's Ghost.

17:01.188 --> 17:07.956
So, but I also had been absolutely obsessed with Oswald and the assassination for 30 years.

17:08.016 --> 17:09.237
I'd been a conspiratorialist.

17:09.758 --> 17:11.520
I'd read a lot of the literature over the years.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.681
I'd lived with it.

17:12.761 --> 17:15.404
I tried to... You reviewed Mark Lane's book?

17:15.424 --> 17:15.865
I reviewed it.

17:15.905 --> 17:17.907
I gave it a good review back in whatever the year was.

17:17.927 --> 17:20.090
It was 67, wasn't it?

17:20.530 --> 17:20.871
I forget.

17:20.951 --> 17:24.815
But anyway, I was terribly suspicious of the whole thing.

17:25.155 --> 17:30.942
The more I got to know about the CIA, the more I began to understand that

17:31.462 --> 17:35.307
They don't, with the exception of the Bay of Pigs, they really did very few things from the top.

17:35.968 --> 17:42.015
And even when they were doing the Bay of Pigs, they were quarantining it, so not all the top knew what was going on at the same time.

17:42.836 --> 17:47.762
And certainly it seemed to me there was beyond their measure to have plotted any assassination of Kennedy from the top.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.124
That had to be distorted.

17:49.685 --> 17:51.207
Probably there were enclaves in the CIA.

17:52.668 --> 17:55.512
If anyone in the CIA had done it, it would have been enclaves.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.975
So I was about that point when I started the book.

17:59.913 --> 18:04.781
I'm not being very organized with you three today because I'm not answering the basic question you asked.

18:04.801 --> 18:10.870
Well, let me try to answer this one then.

18:10.910 --> 18:17.301
If I take care to a degree of each agenda, then maybe we can wander more.

18:19.624 --> 18:25.093
I was surprised when I started studying Oswald's life, I was surprised at how ballsy he was.

18:26.457 --> 18:30.865
I never think, when a guy's got guts, I never look upon him as an identity.

18:31.847 --> 18:35.673
Because we all know that guts is the hardest single thing for a man to have.

18:35.713 --> 18:36.935
It's just not routine.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.682
It's in disrepute now because machismo is scoffed at.

18:41.544 --> 18:43.487
But if he's obnoxious, Ballsy.

18:43.754 --> 18:47.459
Well, then he's obnoxious, ballsy, but it doesn't mean he's a nerd.

18:47.539 --> 18:52.445
Don't you think there's something unique about him just going, I want to live in Russia.

18:52.585 --> 18:54.007
I want to just be ideological.

18:54.107 --> 18:54.948
I want to check out Russia.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.971
I think it's childlike and strange.

18:57.031 --> 18:58.813
Oh, come on, come on now.

18:58.853 --> 19:00.295
It's not childlike and strange at all.

19:00.315 --> 19:04.500
What do you mean he's never been anywhere and he suddenly says, oh, I think I'll go live in Russia?

19:04.520 --> 19:07.524
He wanted so desperately to be taken seriously.

19:07.544 --> 19:10.588
Listen, he was a gambler at a high stakes table at the least.

19:10.957 --> 19:25.556
because even if he's childlike and strange, and he was that too, nonetheless, he's read enough to know that he's betting that everything he reads in the papers and everything he hears in the media that the Soviet Union is in terrible, terrible places wrong.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.460
That's a very large bet, because you're betting with your life.

19:29.221 --> 19:30.382
And again, he's desperate.

19:30.442 --> 19:37.191
Nonetheless, some people who are desperate just slowly collapse and die young, and others who are desperate try things.

19:37.251 --> 19:38.092
And this guy tried it.

19:38.373 --> 19:39.014
He went over there.

19:39.795 --> 19:40.896
And then he gets over there,

19:41.551 --> 19:43.974
And once he's over there, I found my astonishment.

19:44.014 --> 19:47.077
I mean, he was a weak, pathetic figure.

19:47.117 --> 19:49.960
He reminded me of myself in Paris at the age of 23.

19:50.821 --> 19:53.063
Can't speak the language, thought I could, now I can't.

19:54.244 --> 19:55.966
Didn't stay in your hotel room.

19:56.026 --> 19:57.868
No, I didn't stay in my hotel room.

19:58.288 --> 20:00.971
That to me indicates just how terrified he was once he got there.

20:01.272 --> 20:03.714
It was like he used all his courage to get there, and then he collapsed.

20:04.034 --> 20:06.437
And then slowly he gains his courage over a couple of years.

20:07.058 --> 20:10.021
And he also gets repelled by the life of the Soviet Union.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.322
And he suddenly wants to go back.

20:12.112 --> 20:13.834
Well, then he takes on both bureaucracies.

20:13.894 --> 20:15.956
That's not a small business.

20:15.976 --> 20:18.259
So he takes on both bureaucracies, and he succeeds.

20:19.200 --> 20:28.350
He succeeds through, really, he's at his most adroit there, because he inspires, he senses that these bureaucracies, he understands them in some funny way, he understands their fear.

20:28.910 --> 20:31.373
Their fear is they're going to get caught with something they can't handle.

20:32.374 --> 20:41.224
And so he works on the Russians to the point where the Russians are saying to themselves, he's so unstable, if he commits suicide again,

20:41.693 --> 20:42.894
It'll be a scandal for us.

20:43.935 --> 20:46.818
And of course, for a bureaucrat, what it means is, I don't want it to be my scandal.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.561
So they keep passing.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.582
That's like musical chairs.

20:50.602 --> 20:56.588
So finally, when no one will agree to accept the fact that they're without a chair, they decide they're going to let them go back.

20:57.669 --> 21:01.974
And then the same thing happens with the State Department, where they say, how can we not accept him and his wife?

21:02.514 --> 21:06.959
Because if we don't accept him and his wife, if we just accept him, it'll be an international scandal.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.962
American who's defective wants to come back.

21:10.432 --> 21:39.645
and uh we will accept him but not his wife so they decide they have to accept him and his wife and his child well that takes more than uh ordinary uh stick-to-itiveness if nothing else took him a year to get back a year of writing letters all the time keeping up the pressure in fact it was a year and a half before he got back so there's all that then he gets back and and he takes a pot shot at general walker that's not exactly you don't go out in an alley at night facing

21:40.503 --> 21:47.531
these right-wing, these John Birchers who might have people all around the house who might be the catchmen, beat them up.

21:48.272 --> 21:49.713
No, I mean, he's got guts.

21:50.975 --> 21:58.603
In some ways, you portray him as a single soul against both bureaucracies and against a failed communism.

21:58.623 --> 22:09.075
Someone who has a vision that's beyond anything that's realized, you know, sort of really deeply idealistic, willing to take it all on, willing to be a terrorist against all of it.

22:09.612 --> 22:11.574
Well, you know, he is that.

22:11.914 --> 22:15.799
He's a great many other things as well, because that's the sign of him that's boldest.

22:16.319 --> 22:22.646
He's also the failed husband, the bad worker, the man who can't spell.

22:23.647 --> 22:26.490
He's a complex figure.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.192
Can I just stay with that for a minute?

22:28.312 --> 22:29.053
I know I'm talking about it.

22:29.073 --> 22:30.895
Please feel free to shut me up at some point.

22:31.876 --> 22:36.801
But I do want to say the business about his dyslexia and his syntax, and you cleaning it up for the most part.

22:36.861 --> 22:38.623
I mean, I understand your motives in doing that.

22:38.772 --> 22:42.475
But it sort of signaled to me the degree to which you were identifying with him.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.177
Because you give him your syntax.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.078
You give him your mastery.

22:45.098 --> 22:45.738
No, no, no.

22:45.818 --> 22:48.000
In fact, I gave him my assistant's syntax.

22:48.020 --> 22:48.601
Oh, did you?

22:48.621 --> 22:51.083
No, no, I didn't want to get into it when I started playing with the pros.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.564
You gave him another syntax.

22:52.584 --> 22:54.966
No, I gave her a very... She's a very intelligent woman.

22:55.006 --> 22:55.987
I gave her a specific instruction.

22:56.027 --> 22:58.209
I said, don't improve him.

22:59.050 --> 22:59.911
Just clean him up.

23:01.112 --> 23:05.376
And, you know, then she'd have spots where she'd say, what do I do here?

23:05.536 --> 23:06.817
And we'd look at it, we'd discuss it.

23:07.257 --> 23:07.918
So, but there was...

23:08.337 --> 23:11.300
I didn't want to give him a style that he didn't deserve.

23:11.320 --> 23:18.408
In other words, I felt... A member of my family has had dyslexia, so I felt it was very bright.

23:18.868 --> 23:21.130
So I had a certain personal feeling there.

23:21.971 --> 23:32.482
But usually there's an inability to read as well as an inability to write, and yet he is portrayed as reading and reading and reading and doing that above all else.

23:32.963 --> 23:34.024
Well, we don't know how he read.

23:34.460 --> 23:37.424
That is, I can see where you can have dyslexia and you can still read.

23:37.444 --> 23:39.007
Just force yourself to read at great speed.

23:39.528 --> 23:40.569
What you pick up, you pick up.

23:40.589 --> 23:41.451
What you don't, you don't.

23:42.612 --> 23:46.037
But he... He was reading very difficult things.

23:46.057 --> 23:46.738
Yeah.

23:46.759 --> 23:51.826
Very literate people would have... Yeah, he was reading fairly good stuff, fairly tough stuff.

23:53.168 --> 24:03.724
And, what was it, Robert Payne on Mao Zedong and Mein Kampf and... Can I quote Norman Mailer to you from 1963, your Paris interview?

24:04.092 --> 24:11.423
Now a man can be evil, but I believe that people can be evil in their essential natures and still have good characters.

24:11.623 --> 24:16.150
Of course, you're talking about fiction, but I wonder if that applies as well, in your view?

24:16.490 --> 24:16.831
Of him?

24:17.472 --> 24:18.553
I don't think he had a good character.

24:18.573 --> 24:19.595
I think he had a bad character.

24:19.995 --> 24:21.237
He was a psychopathic liar.

24:22.639 --> 24:24.562
He was a brute with his wife.

24:25.103 --> 24:26.244
No, I don't think he had a good character.

24:27.005 --> 24:28.367
So that doesn't apply at all?

24:28.828 --> 24:29.769
I would think not, no.

24:30.050 --> 24:30.150
Okay.

24:30.687 --> 24:32.230
Did I say that no one can be evil?

24:33.512 --> 24:33.672
No.

24:33.732 --> 24:35.155
Now a man can be evil.

24:35.175 --> 24:35.956
Can be evil, yeah.

24:35.976 --> 24:42.568
I believe that people can be evil in their essential natures and still have good characters, which I thought was very... Well, they're effective.

24:42.829 --> 24:43.690
They're effective.

24:43.710 --> 24:46.255
Again, of course, we're talking about fictional works there.

24:46.335 --> 24:48.038
I'm not sure he was evil in his...

24:48.473 --> 25:18.177
essential nature either i'm not sure either you know i've lived with it back and forth and uh he could have been evil he could have definitely been evil and is he a character in your view or a being because you drew a distinction of that review as well a character i bet i'd say he's a being rather than a character i feel much sure you might explain for these other two which with the difference i still remember when i think i'll read it to you a character is someone you can grasp as a whole you can have a clear idea idea of him but a being is someone where nature keeps shifting

25:18.646 --> 25:21.990
All right, he would definitely be a being.

25:22.070 --> 25:25.133
No, he's absolutely a being, not a character.

25:25.153 --> 25:26.315
Which is part of the problem with him.

25:26.335 --> 25:28.257
You do plot some consistency.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.339
I mean, you do plot consistency.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.284
It seems to me two things happen simultaneously.

25:34.524 --> 25:37.127
Conspiracy theory falls away more and more.

25:37.648 --> 25:42.493
The lone gunman becomes ascendant, and he has a personality and a character.

25:43.250 --> 25:54.787
He becomes more confidential, and you cannot prevent yourself, you as writer, it seems to me, from openly sympathizing in some ways with his pathos, caring for him.

25:54.807 --> 25:59.554
Well, you can feel pathos for a great many people that finally you disapprove of.

25:59.574 --> 26:01.297
I mean, that's part of the... Okay, there's a limit.

26:01.317 --> 26:04.322
I mean, are you capable of pathos for Hitler?

26:04.342 --> 26:04.802
Probably not.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.265
No, no.

26:06.445 --> 26:07.266
No, sorry.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.561
Well, but Oswald's not him.

26:08.741 --> 26:09.903
No, no, he's not.

26:09.923 --> 26:11.806
The numbers are different for one thing.

26:11.826 --> 26:12.226
Sure.

26:12.246 --> 26:14.450
You know, it'd be much harder to feel pathos for it, let's say.

26:15.191 --> 26:16.693
Assuming Timothy McVeigh was Gilley.

26:17.114 --> 26:19.858
It'd be much harder to feel pathos for him than for Oswald.

26:19.898 --> 26:21.501
Now you're getting into my next question.

26:21.781 --> 26:22.082
All right.

26:22.823 --> 26:26.569
If Oswald were here today, would he be a member of a militia?

26:26.609 --> 26:28.151
Would he be on the internet?

26:28.171 --> 26:30.875
Would he be one of those boring nerds out there?

26:30.895 --> 26:33.399
I think he'd be on the internet.

26:33.439 --> 26:35.262
He'd be postmodernist.

26:35.478 --> 26:42.704
I think he'd, I think he'd be, I don't know that... As well on the internet, I like it.

26:42.724 --> 26:42.905
Yeah.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.073
Well, you can have it.

26:45.193 --> 26:47.040
I have to share.

26:47.662 --> 26:48.243
I'm not.

26:49.204 --> 26:49.425
Are you?

26:49.505 --> 26:49.905
I'm not.

26:50.386 --> 26:52.509
I can't deal with the internet, all that banality.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.754
It's hard enough to get everything done without having one more thing to do.

26:55.774 --> 26:58.277
People come up to me on the street and hand me a brochure.

26:58.298 --> 27:00.240
I say, I'm sorry, I've got too much information.

27:00.300 --> 27:00.961
That's the way I feel.

27:01.042 --> 27:02.504
I don't want any more coming in.

27:02.544 --> 27:10.415
Anyway, you think he might be... He would have been on the internet, for sure, sending out all kinds of manifestos and statements.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.759
Well, look at his political programming.

27:12.779 --> 27:14.201
He was a libertarian back then.

27:15.002 --> 27:15.963
He wanted no government.

27:16.043 --> 27:17.145
Both governments were wrong.

27:17.446 --> 27:18.508
Both governments were bad.

27:18.548 --> 27:19.489
He wanted no government.

27:19.509 --> 27:25.898
He wanted small collective groups formed by a mutual association, a mutual agreement.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.263
He might have been a militiaman.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.865
That's not unlike what they want.

27:31.025 --> 27:42.762
I think he kind of liked the idea of killing people one by one and choosing a target very carefully, which is altogether different from blowing up a building indiscriminately with hundreds of people inside.

27:43.315 --> 27:45.738
And he wasn't on the right, if we can believe this account.

27:45.758 --> 27:46.719
He wasn't on the far right.

27:46.739 --> 27:59.393
Well, the latest conspiracy on the internet, I understand, was the second bomb that really brought the building down, and there's some FBI man spreading this story, that it was really a conspiracy out of Washington.

27:59.413 --> 28:01.995
I'm not quite sure why this goes.

28:02.015 --> 28:04.118
Oh, you mean they took the first bomb to hide the second bomb?

28:04.158 --> 28:04.398
Yes.

28:04.698 --> 28:06.841
The second bomb was buried in the bowels of the building?

28:07.381 --> 28:07.461
Yes.

28:07.481 --> 28:07.862
Anyway.

28:07.962 --> 28:10.825
Oh boy, we're off again, aren't we?

28:11.564 --> 28:15.290
You said that writing fiction, of course, is the primary calling.

28:15.310 --> 28:17.433
Do you continue to feel that way?

28:17.493 --> 28:24.624
And if so, how do you place this book into the corpus of the 28 books that you've written?

28:24.644 --> 28:29.492
Fiction's got a lot of virtues for me that nonfiction doesn't have.

28:29.913 --> 28:30.574
It's more interesting.

28:30.594 --> 28:31.335
It's more exciting.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.458
It's chancier.

28:33.618 --> 28:36.463
But that was the main event for you once upon a time, I think, as well.

28:36.563 --> 28:37.825
Well, it's fiction.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.673
The thing is, fiction's a grace.

28:39.734 --> 28:40.134
You get it.

28:40.154 --> 28:41.015
It's like falling in love.

28:41.035 --> 28:42.537
You can't say, I want to fall in love next year.

28:42.857 --> 28:46.221
You can say, next year I'm going to write a book of nonfiction about this or that.

28:46.241 --> 28:49.265
I can choose a nonfiction book and decide I want to do it and do it.

28:49.825 --> 28:52.649
And know the odds are very much in my favor that I'll finish that book.

28:53.229 --> 28:57.034
It just involves bringing a certain amount of energy and attention and dedication to the book.

28:57.534 --> 29:01.459
But with fiction, you can start with a marvelous idea and it can depart from you.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.001
Your characters can disappoint you.

29:03.061 --> 29:04.062
They can disappear on you.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.765
Or you discover as you get into the book that

29:07.387 --> 29:12.514
you're heading toward an unknown continent, and you don't know enough about it, which is what happened with Arnold's Ghost.

29:13.576 --> 29:24.210
I realized that if the book was going to make any sense at all for me, I mean, I could have faked the KGB, I could have faked the whole thing, but then I would have felt that the first half, in which I spent so much time, was now being betrayed.

29:25.031 --> 29:34.845
So I kind of come to a stop and feel that I don't know anymore about the KGB than I've read in newspapers, books, so forth, and I don't believe any of it.

29:34.985 --> 29:35.826
It isn't good enough.

29:36.227 --> 29:36.988
It's too pat.

29:37.306 --> 29:41.612
It's too, I want to meet this evil organization up close.

29:42.353 --> 29:59.916
So, of course, when you meet it up close, what you find is absolutely fascinating, because what you've got are a series of high-level professionals, very much like their CIA counterparts, who see themselves as patriots and engage in a tricky, difficult, but essentially noble profession.

30:00.838 --> 30:05.524
You know, and if you start to have a discussion with them on the order of, what about the gulags?

30:06.095 --> 30:14.708
They'd look at you about the way a CIA man would glare back if you said, yes, but how about marry in prison, you see?

30:15.349 --> 30:17.592
And he'd look at you and say, well, what the hell's that got to do with me?

30:19.695 --> 30:26.406
Is there a sense in which the Oswald book is a continuation of all this goes out?

30:26.846 --> 30:27.567
No, no.

30:27.587 --> 30:29.029
I have a feeling you have no.

30:29.049 --> 30:30.752
Well, actually, I was also going to ask, so you,

30:31.036 --> 30:34.620
To make clear, you really went there to research two books, then.

30:34.860 --> 30:35.761
No, no, no, no.

30:35.881 --> 30:45.251
I was passive about whatever I would learn about the KGB that didn't go into the Oswald book would be there somewhere, and my imagination could work on it.

30:45.272 --> 30:48.135
But you did have to step back from Harlan's Ghost for a while, learn more.

30:48.575 --> 30:57.685
Yeah, but I may have made the wrong move, as far as that goes, because when you use something directly, you very often don't have anything left over for the novel.

30:58.326 --> 30:59.507
For example, when...

31:00.230 --> 31:02.373
Bressa and I were in that mayor rally campaign.

31:02.453 --> 31:04.736
Everybody was saying to us, oh, you're going to write about it, for sure.

31:05.276 --> 31:07.179
But in fact, we kept using it as we did it.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.943
If we saw something interesting in that day, that was in our speeches two hours later.

31:11.764 --> 31:16.731
Because there is that about politics, that you keep feeding yourself in order to be able to keep giving it out.

31:17.451 --> 31:21.697
And before it was all over, you know, people say, you're going to write about it.

31:21.717 --> 31:23.519
We say, we're never going to write about it.

31:23.539 --> 31:24.600
We just knew it, and we did it.

31:25.501 --> 31:26.743
There just was nothing to write about.

31:27.027 --> 31:29.532
I mean, I couldn't write a paragraph about that Mayor Ali campaign.

31:29.552 --> 31:30.214
It would be interesting.

31:30.594 --> 31:31.576
Could you do it now?

31:31.677 --> 31:32.759
Could you do it now after something?

31:32.779 --> 31:35.625
Now I can write a page, maybe, but I could never write a book about it.

31:35.645 --> 31:38.070
Although I learned a lot, but it was all... You said it made you less interesting.

31:38.090 --> 31:42.679
If I remember correctly, you said there was something about active politics that makes one less interesting.

31:42.940 --> 31:43.461
Yeah, yeah.

31:43.481 --> 31:44.864
And one becomes less interesting to oneself.

31:45.124 --> 31:47.449
Yeah, you get awfully tired of yourself.

31:47.986 --> 31:51.290
because finally you become a fraud just by campaigning.

31:51.791 --> 31:53.753
I think it just does terrible things to language, don't you?

31:54.034 --> 31:57.939
The language, well, we used to work hard on our language while we were campaigning.

31:57.979 --> 31:58.479
Give us that.

31:59.421 --> 32:01.303
You know, it was the 12th speech of the day.

32:01.343 --> 32:06.490
We were still trying to give a good speech and keep the English reasonably decent and not degenerate.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.973
But I want to tell you, it took a lot out.

32:09.193 --> 32:10.555
It took a lot out of him, took a lot out of me.

32:10.955 --> 32:15.601
Anyway, it may have happened, because I wasn't going to hold back on this book.

32:15.621 --> 32:16.963
I never believed in holding back on it, but

32:17.382 --> 32:20.507
Each book you do, you give it whatever you're capable of giving.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.592
About Oswald's tale, so I wasn't holding back.

32:23.993 --> 32:26.096
I wasn't saying, this is too good to get to this book, no.

32:26.978 --> 32:31.305
And it may be that when I start writing about it, it really won't come alive for me, the KGB.

32:31.926 --> 32:33.108
I might have made a mistake that way.

32:33.188 --> 32:33.729
I'll find out.

32:35.852 --> 32:37.936
Or I might decide that there's not going to be that much KGB.

32:38.276 --> 32:41.702
Now that I know what the KGB is, I don't have to write about it that hard.

32:42.391 --> 32:46.616
You know, I'm writing a novel about the CIA, not the KGB.

32:46.636 --> 32:49.279
You've always maintained, though, the plot emerges from your characters.

32:49.780 --> 32:50.681
Is that the same here?

32:50.701 --> 32:51.021
Yeah.

32:51.482 --> 32:53.545
I just didn't have any characters for the KGB, put it that way.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.506
Now I have a few, maybe.

32:54.766 --> 32:58.150
And you still don't really know where the plot of this next novel is going to go.

32:58.350 --> 32:58.751
No, no.

32:58.831 --> 32:59.972
I like to discover the plot.

32:59.992 --> 33:02.535
Are we talking about the next novel as a continuation of all this?

33:02.556 --> 33:03.597
Yeah, yeah.

33:03.617 --> 33:07.481
Yeah, Oswald's tale is not a continuation.

33:07.822 --> 33:08.723
Well, I made the promise.

33:08.763 --> 33:09.644
Let's see if I keep it.

33:10.846 --> 33:12.027
It's still an open bank.

33:13.205 --> 33:14.687
It's hard riding them all.

33:14.707 --> 33:18.611
I mean, I've been riding enough fights all my life, and I finally come to understand old fighters.

33:19.151 --> 33:21.714
I know why old fighters don't like tough fights.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.356
Because they kill you.

33:23.396 --> 33:24.497
They really age you.

33:24.797 --> 33:27.800
You know, an old fighter, like Foreman, or like Hollywood.

33:27.820 --> 33:30.924
Well, like a German fighter, that'll affect his crack again.

33:30.944 --> 33:38.572
Well, no, but, you know, you get into them, and at the end of it, their bodies have taken a beating from which they won't finally recover completely.

33:39.152 --> 33:40.153
And they don't like it.

33:40.173 --> 33:41.895
And riding is like that, fucking fiction.

33:42.078 --> 33:44.080
Too much anxiety, it just heats up your guts.

33:45.261 --> 33:48.685
I mean, there are great many benefits to it, but you pay a physical price.

33:49.646 --> 33:54.091
You have to keep competing with yourself, and it gets tiring.

33:55.012 --> 33:59.437
Well, it's scary, because on a given day, you can wreck the book.

33:59.457 --> 34:04.162
And so it's sort of, to that extent, it's a slightly, it's a high-wire act.

34:04.442 --> 34:06.665
When you have a good book, the anxiety increases.

34:06.925 --> 34:09.908
So that's the similarity in writing and finding, right?

34:10.512 --> 34:17.319
Yeah, you can be ahead against the fighter you shouldn't be ahead on, and think of the subtle anxiety or is there not to lose it.

34:17.599 --> 34:26.168
I'm just thinking of the elements of risk, the elements of going out there and maybe just really being thoroughly embarrassed, just being on the edge of yourself.

34:26.749 --> 34:37.380
And in Oswald, you give Oswald some really powerful language right near the end as he's there with his rifle, and you say something about him descending into the bottom of himself, awaiting judgment.

34:37.630 --> 34:40.735
I mean, that very paragraph could have been about a writer or a fighter.

34:41.596 --> 34:42.237
Well, I felt that.

34:42.417 --> 34:47.004
Look, I thought if he was going to succeed at that point, it was because he would transcend himself.

34:48.767 --> 34:51.451
You know, Oswald was always a bell-shaped curve.

34:51.491 --> 34:52.993
He was always all of the bell-shaped curve.

34:53.374 --> 34:58.822
In other words, any activity he'd engage in, if you see what is worst and see what is best, there's very little similarity.

34:59.162 --> 35:05.612
So I rather like the idea that he could miss a rabbit from 10 feet with a shotgun, and you have to pull off a couple of those shots.

35:06.048 --> 35:07.030
Because that was his nature.

35:07.110 --> 35:09.636
The best and the worst were very far apart.

35:10.878 --> 35:13.725
That doesn't mean, you know, that you end up with a deep affection for the guy.

35:14.266 --> 35:14.626
You don't.

35:15.448 --> 35:18.816
The hardest thing with Oswald is it's very hard to feel affection for him of any sort.

35:19.878 --> 35:23.085
You know, we were talking about pathos a little earlier.

35:23.325 --> 35:24.528
You don't feel pathos for Hitler.

35:24.568 --> 35:26.031
Well, you don't feel much for Oswald.

35:26.872 --> 35:29.455
It's part of the problem with writing about it.

35:29.535 --> 35:30.376
I feel it from Marina.

35:30.676 --> 35:31.437
Oh, yeah.

35:31.457 --> 35:34.821
She's, I think, an absolutely fascinating character.

35:34.881 --> 35:39.927
And I was baffled by that New York Times Magazine interview with June.

35:40.848 --> 35:41.509
I was cheap as a kid.

35:41.529 --> 35:44.772
She seems to portray an entirely different woman from what you do.

35:44.792 --> 35:47.075
I suppose that's the distance of another generation.

35:47.115 --> 35:49.377
Well, Marina has many sides, and she's very tough, Marina.

35:49.417 --> 35:50.879
Yeah, she had to be.

35:50.899 --> 35:56.085
You know, Larry Schiller was always throwing Tolstoy around when he'd talk to people.

35:56.318 --> 36:22.815
he got the russians to in part he got them to agree to do it because he kept saying you can't say no to manor he's our american so what happens is he did the same thing with marina when he wanted to get the interviews with her he kept saying well this is hard you realize and and of course marina's so complex she rather loved the idea a good writer writing about her so then she read the excerpt that was in the new yorker and larry called her up and said what do you think of it and she said well

36:24.803 --> 36:26.205
He's not Tolstoy.

36:28.107 --> 36:34.453
So... I'd like to talk a little bit about... Could I just ask one more thing about Maria, just to finish that?

36:35.154 --> 36:37.036
Now you see what Larry and I went through.

36:37.156 --> 36:39.379
Well, you know, I'm the female here.

36:39.399 --> 36:40.820
I've got to leap in once in a while.

36:40.940 --> 36:41.561
No, no, no, no.

36:41.581 --> 36:45.606
I just mean that for all of you, you all have an idea of what it was like working with you.

36:45.626 --> 36:46.787
That's what you're doing, huh?

36:46.807 --> 36:50.671
Except we're not arguing with each other.

36:51.011 --> 36:52.153
Why don't you just go ahead?

36:52.173 --> 36:53.174
No, go ahead.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.355
Go ahead, please.

36:55.229 --> 36:57.833
I want you to go past me first, please.

36:57.853 --> 37:03.882
I keep envisioning these people as if they were contemporary today.

37:03.922 --> 37:07.126
And I can see Marina on a talk show.

37:07.186 --> 37:12.875
I can see her on Maury, or maybe not Oprah, but some of the others.

37:13.736 --> 37:22.148
The thing that you say about him, craving attention, I see in all of these people, in Marguerite,

37:22.617 --> 37:35.411
in Marina, and maybe there's a layer of the population there that just never gets any attention, and it seems that there's this hunger.

37:35.992 --> 37:42.839
Well, Marguerite particularly, I think, was a precursor for a lot of women who need attention, who crave attention.

37:43.820 --> 37:47.004
Marguerite had an almost physical need for attention.

37:47.204 --> 37:48.806
Yeah.

37:48.826 --> 37:50.788
And she's a remarkable woman, in fact.

37:51.088 --> 37:52.590
Not agreeable, but remarkable.

37:52.891 --> 37:54.995
In my mind.

37:55.737 --> 37:59.284
And Malina, I think, would not necessarily be on these shows in a hurry.

37:59.865 --> 38:02.691
She has a great deal of ambivalence about self-exposure.

38:02.711 --> 38:08.723
On the one hand, she's so Russian and so full of guilt over so many things that she fears she has to confess.

38:09.163 --> 38:10.967
On the other hand, it's anathema that I have confessed.

38:11.234 --> 38:12.656
And she doesn't like people too much.

38:12.976 --> 38:15.900
She's really seen the worst edge of the media all these years.

38:16.261 --> 38:20.907
So the idea of baring her soul in public before the media would not appeal to her.

38:20.927 --> 38:30.399
Marguerite would have loved it, because Marguerite was, in fact, in another time, if Marguerite had been born later, she probably would have been the host on a TV show and done all the talking.

38:30.419 --> 38:32.121
I love that idea.

38:33.743 --> 38:34.805
I'm sorry, thanks.

38:35.005 --> 38:41.173
I'm interested also in putting this book in the perspective of your career, because I've been reading Norman Mailer

38:41.457 --> 38:44.220
for a lot of years, quite with great pleasure.

38:44.240 --> 38:50.327
And reading that Paris Review interview this morning really was great, because you do say a few things.

38:50.367 --> 38:52.150
I don't know how old you were, 32 or 33?

38:52.710 --> 38:55.273
What was the year of the review, I can tell you?

38:55.293 --> 38:55.493
63.

38:55.533 --> 38:56.575
63, I was 40.

38:57.195 --> 39:05.185
So, but here you are saying, I've got to come to grips with myself, with my talent, with what I've made of it, and what I've spoiled of it.

39:05.325 --> 39:07.127
That's one quote, and I love this one too.

39:07.883 --> 39:10.347
talking about, in general, what a writer can do.

39:10.567 --> 39:17.317
At best you affect, pardon me, the consciousness of your time, and so indirectly you affect the history of the time, which succeeds you.

39:17.758 --> 39:26.451
I wonder if you feel that, looking back 30 years, have you, have you, do you have any solutions to those statements?

39:27.072 --> 39:36.186
Well, I think, when I talk about, you know, what you spoil or ruin of your town, is this, you know, I was,

39:36.638 --> 39:46.731
just wasting a lot of time and getting into a lot of capers and getting into troubles of one sort or another and losing this, losing that, and getting drunk too much and so forth, and killing a lot of writing like I could have done.

39:47.232 --> 39:49.675
So I think over the years I've gotten that more or less in shape.

39:50.216 --> 39:52.298
You know, I'm much more disciplined now than I was then.

39:52.979 --> 39:55.883
The other thing about affecting the consciousness of your time, how do you know how much you affected?

39:56.304 --> 40:06.477
I was thinking the other day about Hemingway, and I was thinking, my God, no American president, with the possible exception of Roosevelt and, I don't know, Kennedy and a couple others maybe,

40:06.727 --> 40:09.411
has affected the American consciousness as much as Hemingway.

40:09.952 --> 40:13.999
You can't see a movie or an ad these days that doesn't have Hemingway's influence on it.

40:14.479 --> 40:21.671
You have some of those idiot ads where people skateboard off a mountain and end up in an icy pond holding a can of beer.

40:21.971 --> 40:22.632
That's Hemingway.

40:23.934 --> 40:26.559
You know, the whole idea of throwing away the gesture.

40:28.582 --> 40:30.765
So in that sense, he's had an enormous influence.

40:31.647 --> 40:33.029
Now, if I have any influence, I don't know.

40:33.590 --> 40:34.371
You know, it's hard to...

40:35.060 --> 40:44.172
You don't want to spend time saying, I have this influence on that, because you get, you know, you get, I don't know, you get, everything gets out of proportion.

40:44.753 --> 40:49.419
There's a Forrest Sawyer on, what's that, is it Nightline, Ted Koppel's show?

40:50.180 --> 40:52.303
He's the number two man there, Forrest Sawyer.

40:52.323 --> 41:04.780
He's furious at us, because apparently he once had an afternoon where he saw a little bit of the KGB file, and then he did a show on it, and he spent a couple of weeks in Minsk interviewing people, and some people,

41:05.063 --> 41:09.430
When the interviewer said we had done an exclusive, we hadn't gotten exclusive rights to the KGB file.

41:09.450 --> 41:16.342
Well, we did in the sense that we actually saw the damn thing, that we Xeroxed 300 pages of it, that we lived there.

41:16.462 --> 41:18.565
The main thing is we lived there for six months and did the job.

41:18.626 --> 41:24.555
This guy's carrying on like it's the greatest miscarriage of justice since time began because we're taking away his influence.

41:25.156 --> 41:28.642
Well, he sent me a transcript of his show, and it was a mediocre show.

41:29.464 --> 41:30.345
We didn't tell you anything.

41:30.747 --> 41:31.688
Well, you look impatient.

41:31.708 --> 41:34.593
We don't want a particular piece of you.

41:34.733 --> 41:36.335
Listen, I want to apologize.

41:36.395 --> 41:39.179
This is the first time it hasn't really worked too well.

41:39.219 --> 41:40.842
I want to apologize for this threesome.

41:40.862 --> 41:42.885
Well, they should know better.

41:43.105 --> 41:44.367
No, no, it was my doing.

41:44.387 --> 41:45.709
I'm the one who's responsible.

41:45.729 --> 41:46.690
They usually work well.

41:46.730 --> 41:51.597
They should know what people to put together and what people are going to go in one direction.

41:51.697 --> 41:54.562
I think you've got probably three strong-minded interviews.

41:54.802 --> 41:55.002
Yeah.

41:55.022 --> 41:55.523
I'm looking...

41:55.672 --> 41:59.497
Usually there's a lead interviewer in a funny way, and so it works better.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.299
We're all trying to jump at you a little bit.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.441
Well, we've got three individuals.

42:02.701 --> 42:04.384
That's good.

42:04.424 --> 42:05.084
No, that's fine.

42:05.385 --> 42:06.987
But yeah, I did want to leap in a given direction.

42:07.047 --> 42:07.287
Go.

42:07.347 --> 42:12.715
I wanted to leap and maybe stay with this just a little bit and come back to postmodernism.

42:12.735 --> 42:13.896
I'm not necessarily now.

42:14.337 --> 42:14.637
All right.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.621
The business of what you call an algebraic intellectual is interesting.

42:18.182 --> 42:19.263
I say it's not a very good one.

42:19.323 --> 42:22.928
It's interesting, but it's really interesting that it keeps a journal.

42:23.245 --> 42:27.209
You know, that he keeps a journal, and I was wondering when that... You're saying a real intellectual keeps a journal?

42:27.229 --> 42:27.609
No.

42:27.629 --> 42:28.230
No, he does.

42:28.270 --> 42:30.792
I said, these are sort of two separate.

42:31.192 --> 42:34.776
I'm compressing because this is my platform now.

42:35.036 --> 42:35.516
Sorry.

42:35.616 --> 42:38.979
But on the one hand, you call him an intellectual.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.921
I would like you to sort of say what you mean by that.

42:41.282 --> 42:44.645
And second, I found it interesting that he keeps a journal.

42:45.385 --> 42:47.187
And the question asked is why.

42:47.307 --> 42:48.228
Why did he keep a journal?

42:48.328 --> 42:49.609
When did he stop keeping a journal?

42:49.629 --> 42:50.910
What was a journal to him?

42:50.930 --> 42:51.391
Well, wait a minute.

42:51.411 --> 42:52.172
He kept a diary.

42:52.412 --> 42:52.712
Okay.

42:52.962 --> 42:57.206
And the diary I found meager and not terribly interesting, and not well-written.

42:58.026 --> 43:08.015
And there's a lot of people, there's a lot of reason to believe he wrote that diary in a relatively short time, in a couple days or a week, a long time after the events.

43:08.275 --> 43:10.217
It certainly sounds that way, doesn't it?

43:10.237 --> 43:12.579
Yeah, it just doesn't have the ring of a real diary.

43:12.759 --> 43:16.523
It really has the ring of somebody summarizing events sometime later.

43:16.983 --> 43:18.124
So I don't know that he kept it general.

43:18.144 --> 43:18.905
Why do you think he did that?

43:20.186 --> 43:22.648
Well, I think he did it for a reason, whatever the reason was.

43:22.915 --> 43:26.380
He may have taken some notes because he was thinking he'd write articles when he came back to America.

43:26.761 --> 43:31.227
He may have decided that the way to do it and print in America is to be able to print a diary.

43:31.588 --> 43:33.050
He was right that way, I think.

43:33.090 --> 43:35.013
Some newspaper did print his diary at one point.

43:35.033 --> 43:36.134
They got a hold of it and printed it.

43:36.615 --> 43:41.983
I don't recall this exactly, but I have some recollection that the diary was found and printed somewhere.

43:42.483 --> 43:43.365
Maybe I'm wrong on that.

43:43.525 --> 43:46.369
But in any event, it's the kind of thing exactly that a newspaper would print.

43:46.389 --> 43:49.193
And he was very passionate in some certain odd, small ways.

43:49.780 --> 43:51.802
But no, I don't call him a good intellectual.

43:51.842 --> 43:53.183
He was a mediocre intellectual.

43:53.704 --> 43:58.768
But at the age of 24, he was writing, at the age of 23, he was writing stuff that wasn't bad.

43:59.669 --> 44:04.814
I don't know if you looked at the appendix in the book, but his stuff on the Soviet Union cleaned up.

44:05.275 --> 44:05.895
It's readable.

44:06.496 --> 44:09.679
It's nothing remarkable, but I've read feature stories that were less interesting.

44:11.200 --> 44:19.568
Let's say he was somewhere between a 23-year-old feature writer for a newspaper and an intellectual.

44:19.868 --> 44:23.553
I call him an intellectual because he did do some of his own thinking, and his thinking was very important to him.

44:24.554 --> 44:25.515
And finally, he lived.

44:26.076 --> 44:30.221
If there's anything positive about him, it's that thought was that important to him.

44:30.922 --> 44:32.123
In some ways, it seemed to have isolated him.

44:32.884 --> 44:35.107
And it isolated him very much because nobody could understand him.

44:35.387 --> 44:40.654
It isolated him specifically because the entire Russian community was opposed to him.

44:41.214 --> 44:44.759
And of course, being down in the South at that point wasn't exactly the place to be a radical.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.323
But then on top of that, he had a...

44:49.028 --> 44:52.793
you know, he just made people nervous with all that political superiority.

44:54.615 --> 44:58.020
I was going to move it towards the center ahead of that.

44:58.040 --> 45:03.367
In some ways, the size of this, which I know people have talked about, it has a Russian novel, Science.

45:03.708 --> 45:05.570
You know, it's a big novel.

45:05.590 --> 45:08.114
And the fresh stuff is the Russian stuff.

45:08.274 --> 45:12.319
It seems like you like the chance to, this was your Russian novel.

45:12.339 --> 45:14.702
This was your chance to write a Russian novel.

45:14.722 --> 45:18.107
Great vistas of time, space, populace,

45:18.425 --> 45:26.392
to give a lot of indication of what it was like to live under Stalin, what it was like to resist Stalin, the ways in which one lived in fear, the ways in which one resisted.

45:26.732 --> 45:29.315
All of that was very new, very interesting.

45:29.335 --> 45:33.539
Well, that came out of the experience of writing the execution itself.

45:34.039 --> 45:44.268
I didn't think ever that it was going to be my Russian novel, because I knew that that material was going to run out, that I had just so much of that material, and finally the emphasis was going to go from there to Oswald.

45:44.629 --> 45:48.432
But I just wanted to finally locate him in a media

45:50.150 --> 46:07.369
Structurally, what I found interesting was to have this milieu in which he appears almost as a minor figure, as a somewhat mysterious, shadowy figure in this milieu that you can understand better than you can understand him, and then take the story back of that and forward of that.

46:08.931 --> 46:10.253
That just appeared to me structurally.

46:10.313 --> 46:16.820
It was sort of crossing the T. You said from the very beginning you've always been a conspiracy theorist.

46:17.961 --> 46:19.363
How do you end this book?

46:19.546 --> 46:23.192
Well, it was much less of a conspiracy theorist.

46:23.853 --> 46:26.998
I think there's still a real chance that there were conspiracies.

46:27.018 --> 46:35.933
And although I end up guessing three to one that he did it alone, it's just a guess that he could easily have been part of some small conspiracy.

46:36.194 --> 46:37.075
Are you still obsessed?

46:37.115 --> 46:38.578
You said you were obsessed at the beginning.

46:38.598 --> 46:40.581
Much less, much less.

46:40.901 --> 46:42.584
Are you an obsessive person in general?

46:42.724 --> 46:44.327
I try not to be.

46:44.548 --> 46:45.469
Nothing's more wasteful.

46:46.073 --> 46:47.334
No, I hate obsession.

46:47.455 --> 46:51.719
It just consists of putting more and more energy into the same question and never getting an answer.

46:52.240 --> 46:55.824
Are there any other obsessions that you care to tell us about, or is this one in particular?

46:55.844 --> 46:59.728
When I was younger, I used to have a question, am I a good man or not.

46:59.769 --> 47:00.830
That's a terrible obsession.

47:00.910 --> 47:02.091
It's very wasteful.

47:02.732 --> 47:07.958
It just keeps you circling around your navel all the time.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.021
No, I'm fine.

47:11.882 --> 47:14.325
Let me come back to this question in postmodernism.

47:14.879 --> 47:21.269
and say that I think that one of the signs of it for me is the blurring of genre.

47:21.289 --> 47:31.745
In other words, when people start writing nonfiction novels, and when the New York Times doesn't know whether a historian's work is fiction or nonfiction, doesn't know where to put Art Spiegelman's comic book, which they didn't.

47:32.225 --> 47:33.327
They didn't know where to put it.

47:33.347 --> 47:35.671
They put it first as fiction.

47:35.691 --> 47:39.516
Then he wrote a letter saying, David Duke would like to know that you think the Holocaust is fiction.

47:39.537 --> 47:40.658
That's very interesting.

47:40.798 --> 47:42.140
And they put it in nonfiction.

47:42.661 --> 47:43.823
It's all a hot potato.

47:44.090 --> 47:48.516
I think, you know, much as you invade against postmodernism, you can't but be part of it.

47:48.776 --> 47:56.686
That's really the observation I want to make, even in your career and your ability to negotiate different genres so well, and sort of collapse them.

47:57.066 --> 48:04.616
Well, you know, I guess the reason I'm looking quizzical is you have a slightly different notion of postmodernism than I do.

48:05.337 --> 48:09.663
My idea of postmodernism is that you mix strawberries with mustard.

48:09.683 --> 48:12.426
In other words, the idea is that whatever you mix is interesting.

48:12.980 --> 48:22.957
And I think it's because of a huge breakdown in values that finally the only way we can get a free soul clean longer is to try something new, even though there's not a hell of a lot of logic to it, viscerally.

48:26.022 --> 48:35.258
I was interested in breaking down a lot of those barriers because I felt there was much too much pomposity attached to the categories.

48:36.368 --> 48:38.230
Now, you could say that's a postmodernist impulse.

48:38.290 --> 48:38.771
I would.

48:38.791 --> 48:40.032
And I can't argue with that.

48:40.312 --> 48:41.274
All right, I can't argue with that.

48:41.294 --> 48:42.415
And that says all postmodernists.

48:42.435 --> 48:43.376
Despite yourself.

48:43.396 --> 48:44.097
Despite myself.

48:44.197 --> 48:44.858
Mowgli.

48:45.318 --> 48:45.759
Exactly.

48:46.620 --> 48:46.920
All right.

48:47.421 --> 48:55.169
But I always thought I was doing it in order to restore dignity to, this is pretty pompous myself, to modernity.

48:55.670 --> 49:01.637
In other words, let's not pretend that history has a sanctity that the novel does not have.

49:02.197 --> 49:03.339
History is also fiction.

49:03.479 --> 49:05.481
I remember I started that with the armies of the night.

49:06.035 --> 49:14.945
Everything that anyone ever writes is fiction, because having written all my life, I know how impossible it is ever to be accurate.

49:15.566 --> 49:17.108
You are always misleading people.

49:17.608 --> 49:20.512
You mislead people by the act of writing.

49:20.752 --> 49:30.823
The hope is that you also spur their imagination so that they can find their particular misperceptions of reality, new and better misperceptions of reality than they had before.

49:31.424 --> 49:34.928
So there are all these books that you've written, are they consistent?

49:35.313 --> 49:40.540
Do we stand back when a career is done and we're tallying it up?

49:41.481 --> 49:47.930
Has Norman Mailer produced a corpus of work that is identifiable from work one through work whatever it is?

49:48.051 --> 49:48.431
I don't know.

49:48.571 --> 49:50.314
I mean, that's a critical work.

49:50.614 --> 49:51.275
I have themes.

49:51.315 --> 49:51.976
How do you see it?

49:51.996 --> 49:59.346
Do you see it as a ... I did an interview with Nadine Gordemaher here a couple months ago, and she said, everything I write is like walking into a room and

49:59.900 --> 50:05.206
looking at the same statue from different angles, but it's all different takes on this.

50:05.226 --> 50:05.847
Well, I don't know.

50:05.947 --> 50:08.130
I have themes that I come back to.

50:08.991 --> 50:10.613
I don't know if it's all the same.

50:12.075 --> 50:19.243
You know, I could sit here and name themes I'm interested in, but I don't see the point of it, because that's a critic's book.

50:19.263 --> 50:25.671
So everyone is a different, in your view, and everyone is a fresh start, and it's an entity.

50:26.492 --> 50:27.093
No, I don't know.

50:27.113 --> 50:27.974
I don't know how to answer that.

50:27.994 --> 50:29.856
I'm trying to think how to answer it.

50:30.038 --> 50:38.451
You see, when you're working, you don't say, I'm going to do this because it's a continuation of a theme I've been interested in.

50:38.832 --> 50:40.615
What happens is you see an opportunity.

50:43.059 --> 50:44.401
You'll see a book.

50:44.421 --> 50:51.833
Very often I'll get excited by the idea of doing a novel because I feel that I have some special knowledge about the subject.

50:51.853 --> 50:54.397
I have an inside track on the one hand.

50:54.417 --> 50:56.400
On the other hand, I'm going to learn a lot by writing the book.

50:56.870 --> 51:01.515
It's always been boring to me to write about something I know too well because I don't learn anything.

51:02.156 --> 51:05.380
And I think you also use up your imaginative possibilities.

51:05.740 --> 51:06.721
I'll come back to that in a moment.

51:07.402 --> 51:15.471
So it's much more fun, as I say, to learn as you go in a book, provided you have this great advantage.

51:16.112 --> 51:21.518
For example, in Heartless Ghost, I felt that I could have been an intelligence officer.

51:22.219 --> 51:26.083
There was a side of me that was two-faced, deep,

51:27.093 --> 51:33.082
comfortable with duplicity, all of that, and that I had a feeling for it.

51:33.903 --> 51:35.666
On the other hand, I had a lot to learn about the CIA.

51:35.906 --> 51:37.008
So that was a good mixture.

51:37.068 --> 51:37.949
I enjoyed that.

51:38.149 --> 51:39.291
I thought I was entering a world.

51:39.631 --> 51:44.759
I know he was creating a world, but I could only create it in the act of entering it, imaginatively.

51:45.019 --> 51:45.861
So that was a lot of fun.

51:45.981 --> 51:47.022
Well, you put Tough Guys in it.

51:47.363 --> 51:50.648
It was one of my favorite... Tough Guys was a gift.

51:50.968 --> 51:51.549
And a lot of it was fun.

51:51.569 --> 51:52.390
No, Tough Guys was a gift.

51:52.410 --> 51:53.492
I knew a lot about Provincetown.

51:53.532 --> 51:55.615
I'd been there off and on for 50 years.

51:56.084 --> 51:57.505
And I was just in trouble.

51:57.525 --> 51:58.726
I had to write a novel in two months.

51:59.227 --> 52:01.109
So I thought, what am I going to write about?

52:01.129 --> 52:03.070
I've got to write about something that I understand well.

52:03.090 --> 52:03.751
Provenstein.

52:03.811 --> 52:05.032
I never imagined it before.

52:05.052 --> 52:06.774
I really loved the atmosphere of that book.

52:07.254 --> 52:09.556
Well, you've been there, Provenstein.

52:09.576 --> 52:09.817
I'm often.

52:09.837 --> 52:09.957
Yeah.

52:09.977 --> 52:11.919
Well, that's Provenstein in the winter, of course, which is different.

52:13.020 --> 52:14.781
But that book was a gift.

52:14.861 --> 52:16.563
I was ready to go in the tank on that book.

52:16.583 --> 52:19.105
In other words, I had to fulfill a contract for Little Brown.

52:19.806 --> 52:21.607
And if I didn't, I was going to owe them a huge sum of money.

52:22.088 --> 52:25.551
I also love the story and the title, which I love to tell people.

52:25.683 --> 52:26.404
Yeah, yeah.

52:27.365 --> 52:28.366
I wish I'd put it in the movie.

52:28.386 --> 52:29.266
That's the next story.

52:29.286 --> 52:30.688
You said, and I also owed the money.

52:30.728 --> 52:31.749
How were you going to finish that?

52:33.571 --> 52:40.737
Well, so I had to, the choice was either to be in debt for the rest of my life, to Little Brown, or to produce a book in two months, because a whole year had gone by.

52:40.757 --> 52:41.298
Two months, really?

52:41.458 --> 52:44.181
Well, I spent, I was tired after ancient evenings.

52:44.241 --> 52:45.522
I didn't feel like writing again.

52:45.962 --> 52:49.866
And so 10 months went by, and so I realized I had a contract with them to do a book in a year.

52:49.926 --> 52:52.248
And it was like I was a child.

52:52.289 --> 52:53.850
So I said, oh, yes, I owe them a book.

52:54.320 --> 53:04.953
So now I had to write the damn book, and it was one of those, I wrote the book, I worked very hard for two months in a row, and at the end of that time, I had a first draft that worked.

53:04.973 --> 53:07.957
But when I started, I had to think, my God, this will be the worst thing I've ever written.

53:08.698 --> 53:10.280
But I'm not going to be in debt for the rest of my life.

53:10.340 --> 53:11.401
If I have to, I'll go in this time.

53:11.421 --> 53:12.763
Do you have an affection for that book?

53:12.783 --> 53:16.888
Yeah, yeah, it's my favorite book, not my best book, but it's my favorite book.

53:16.908 --> 53:17.849
Because it pulled you out.

53:17.869 --> 53:18.450
Yeah.

53:18.470 --> 53:20.412
Well, follow up then, what's the best book?

53:20.611 --> 53:22.073
I don't know, I wouldn't care to say.

53:22.133 --> 53:31.426
I'd like to think one of the later ones is, one of the later big ones is, but I'd rather not get into that, because I could change my mind to mine.

53:31.506 --> 53:34.330
I just followed up on, you know, you said not my favorite.

53:34.350 --> 53:40.438
No, Tough Guys is my favorite as far as, you know, it's like if a mother has 20 children, she'll point at one as her favorite.

53:40.458 --> 53:41.820
It was such a wonderful delivery.

53:41.920 --> 53:44.644
You know?

53:45.215 --> 53:47.078
The kid could be an idiot.

53:48.139 --> 53:51.925
I just want to bring up what may be the sensitive point of size here.

53:52.746 --> 53:58.014
And I took as a small, uncharacteristically small compared to a lot of your books.

53:58.074 --> 54:00.978
I mean, you can say, look, the material demands that size.

54:01.038 --> 54:01.900
In a sense, that's true.

54:02.180 --> 54:03.382
But you write big books.

54:03.462 --> 54:09.491
Is there a sense that the American novel has to be big to reflect this country, to make impact?

54:09.511 --> 54:10.953
It will not be recognized.

54:10.973 --> 54:12.215
Well, I think the reverse is true now.

54:12.235 --> 54:12.876
If it's small.

54:12.940 --> 54:13.721
The reverse is true.

54:13.741 --> 54:18.786
I mean, everywhere I go now, booksellers, publishers, they always say, why don't you write a short book?

54:18.806 --> 54:19.987
Write a short book.

54:20.008 --> 54:22.971
You know, from top to bottom, it's all do a short book.

54:22.991 --> 54:26.394
Booksellers' attitude is short books take up much less space on our shelves.

54:26.835 --> 54:29.097
That's marketing.

54:29.237 --> 54:31.880
It's all marketing.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.704
And the cost is getting so high now.

54:35.744 --> 54:38.908
Marketing is taking over writing now.

54:39.328 --> 54:42.171
The idea is, the hell with what the book is, can we market it?

54:42.809 --> 54:49.216
And no, big books are a luxury, an indulgence.

54:49.236 --> 54:52.680
You know, as if it's easier to write on a big book than a small one.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.922
Dinosaur was once ruled the Earth, but not much longer.

54:54.942 --> 54:56.744
Yeah, not in literature.

54:56.804 --> 55:03.632
I was convinced at an early age by Thomas Mann, who once said, only be exhausted.

55:04.092 --> 55:04.893
It's truly interesting.

55:08.177 --> 55:09.158
What time is it?

55:09.238 --> 55:09.979
We're close.

55:10.499 --> 55:10.820
Okay.

55:10.920 --> 55:11.280
About two minutes.

55:11.750 --> 55:13.455
Again, I'll pause one more time.

55:13.475 --> 55:14.598
I think it worked out, actually.

55:14.618 --> 55:14.758
Okay.

55:14.858 --> 55:16.723
It was much more difficult, though.

55:16.804 --> 55:21.737
I think as we got comfortable with each other, it worked out.

55:23.722 --> 55:25.607
Well, it's been great.

55:25.888 --> 55:28.054
Would you inscribe a couple of books?
