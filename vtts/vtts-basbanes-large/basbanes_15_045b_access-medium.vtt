00:04.182 --> 00:11.670
And the whole craft of travel writing is really almost an exclusive club these days, isn't it?

00:11.690 --> 00:15.494
I mean, you're in the tradition of Graham Greene and .

00:16.235 --> 00:18.337
It's a very British tradition, it seems.

00:18.357 --> 00:20.760
I don't think you have it in the States to quite the same degree.

00:20.800 --> 00:29.329
And I guess my mentors back in England were people like Fairstark, Patrick Lee Firma, maybe not very well known here.

00:29.714 --> 00:42.887
My contemporaries, though, like Jonathan Rabin, who's moved to Seattle, and Porto, who's, you know, North Atlantic, as it were, and Bruce Chatwin, that was all kind of, you know, these are a bit more familiar, I guess.

00:42.907 --> 00:44.889
But, yes, it's a very old craft.

00:45.329 --> 00:57.561
It goes back to, I guess, one of the reasons is, although I'm only guessing, is that, you know, the British Empire invited people, as it were, to

00:57.845 --> 01:05.553
travel with some sort of security and certainly great superiority complex all the way around the world in a way that no other empire quite did.

01:05.633 --> 01:14.022
And people got used to thinking of the world as their sort of hunting ground, travel writers as well as merchants.

01:14.523 --> 01:22.231
But I think that we have to really distinguish, and this is my job as the critic as well, is to really, I mean the writing is beautiful by the way.

01:23.432 --> 01:24.173
You really do

01:24.693 --> 01:25.994
transport the reader.

01:26.335 --> 01:36.426
And in this age of multimedia attractions with television sets and all these other things, what is the challenge to a travel writer?

01:36.826 --> 01:46.457
What is incumbent upon you to give to the person who picks up the book that the person will get from you and from no other?

01:46.937 --> 01:48.099
It is significant selling.

01:48.119 --> 01:49.660
There are no photographs to it.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.983
We'll talk about that in some ways as well.

01:52.672 --> 02:06.511
I think, you know, what travel writers used to give traditionally, I mean, say, in the last century, was, I mean, travel writers of the more sort of adventurous kind, like myself, was to come back with knowledge that was sort of empirical usefulness to whatever society had sent them.

02:06.811 --> 02:19.168
You know, they'd come back with actual new things, geographical novelty, and it made a lot of those descriptions in that time very sort of exact and almost scientific.

02:19.520 --> 02:46.557
that's all gone of course the travel writer now knows he's been preceded by sociologists and anthropologists and probably art historians and heaven knows what so I think we have automatically become a little different I know that I have and I feel that what I have to give is more the kind of insights that people would get if they were traveling in the way that I'm traveling in other ways

02:46.925 --> 02:55.758
In other words, building up a picture of a region or a civilization or a city piecemeal, really, just as we really experience it.

02:55.798 --> 03:16.189
In other words, by chance encounters, by a little bit of historical knowledge, by sudden interest in landscape or piece of architecture, by everything from the dog that's peeing on the corner of the street to the interesting, maybe highly educated person you meet who tells you about the society.

03:16.456 --> 03:20.942
to the, probably, maybe the victim who suffered in it.

03:20.962 --> 03:45.957
It, in other words, builds up a picture like a mosaic, really, so that your leader, by the end of the book, you hope is given your experience without it having to be tied up in a journalistic way or in an academic way, saying, this is what I know about this country, here it is, it is like this or it is like that.

03:46.105 --> 03:49.068
I don't think on the whole, you know, countries are like that.

03:49.669 --> 04:08.029
And it's maybe truer and, you know, one has the fortune really in an entire book to be able to build up the complexities and the self-contradictions and the thing that one person feels and another suffers and another thinks, you know, in that sort of almost random ways it is.

04:08.350 --> 04:13.075
And of course, in travel writing, you yourself are part of your own landscape, so you're not

04:13.223 --> 04:14.645
playing God so much.

04:14.845 --> 04:17.289
You do bring your baggage to the project, aren't you?

04:17.309 --> 04:18.450
Yes, of course you do.

04:18.650 --> 04:30.527
And I suppose whereas an academic has to say, you know, from my studies, what I know is this, this, and this, and ordering the thing, you're saying, well, here I am traveling in this landscape.

04:30.687 --> 04:35.534
I had altitude sickness today, or I had a stomach cramp, or what it seemed to me was this.

04:36.034 --> 04:41.422
But you're not playing God in the way that you would if you were quite abstracted from your own drama.

04:41.682 --> 04:41.762
Yes.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.404
It is an interesting, it is a curiosity, isn't it?

04:45.424 --> 04:58.780
I mean, there are certainly not as many travel writers today as there were back in the 30s or the 40s, but on the other hand, I don't have to think that this is really, you know, a choice virgin preserve almost, isn't it?

04:58.921 --> 05:04.888
Because it really has been off limits for the larger part of the century entirely almost.

05:05.068 --> 05:08.172
This is almost a unique sort of

05:08.371 --> 05:13.036
opportunity really since 1990 when these countries became independent.

05:13.597 --> 05:20.845
The old Soviet rules by which you had to be in your hotel and you knew exactly where you were every night and where you'd gone and sometimes you were followed.

05:22.007 --> 05:22.768
That's all gone.

05:23.308 --> 05:28.574
Those rules have gone and these independent countries haven't produced regulations of their end to take their place.

05:29.135 --> 05:35.222
So if I was discovered in some out of the way part where I would normally have not been allowed to be, they didn't know what to do with me really.

05:35.388 --> 05:42.417
So for the first time really in any of our lifetimes, I think, you can travel virtually where you like in Central Asia if you want.

05:43.158 --> 05:54.733
Beyond that, as you point out very early on in the book, the Soviet government, and I think the metaphor you used, had attempted to annotate their histories.

05:55.654 --> 06:04.045
Even had you been allowed this limited access, there still would have been this anxiety, fear, out of the part of the people there to really...

06:05.037 --> 06:06.340
give you of themselves.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.425
I mean, you really wouldn't have been able to get the stories.

06:08.445 --> 06:08.725
Absolutely.

06:08.766 --> 06:11.532
They would have never thought of disburdening them that way.

06:11.552 --> 06:16.243
They wouldn't have asked you into their homes, and they would have felt wary of talking to you altogether.

06:16.884 --> 06:19.250
So that was a huge benefit.

06:19.270 --> 06:21.595
I guess it amazes me

06:21.710 --> 06:26.517
You say also that this region is larger geographically than Western Europe.

06:26.537 --> 06:28.279
Is that fascinating?

06:28.319 --> 06:30.122
Yes, it's larger than India.

06:30.362 --> 06:31.223
It's huge.

06:31.283 --> 06:32.285
It's larger than India.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.548
It's enormous Kazakhstan alone.

06:34.568 --> 06:35.870
It's a million square miles.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.293
It's colossal.

06:38.494 --> 06:46.705
So, again, tell me, you had also on the author's note, you point out you've been to China, you've traveled to there, you've done Russia.

06:47.242 --> 06:51.428
This was the missing link, apparently, or the puzzle, the piece of puzzle.

06:51.588 --> 06:53.711
Yeah, this sort of shadow land in the middle.

06:53.911 --> 06:58.417
Is this something you had always wanted to do, or is it opportunity?

06:58.477 --> 07:00.660
I mean, is this a target of opportunities?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.142
No, I'd always wanted to do it.

07:02.583 --> 07:08.891
It was just lucky for me that it became so much more open at the time that I came to it.

07:09.332 --> 07:16.101
Now, I wanted to do it originally when I was traveling in the early 80s in the last years of Brezhnev in the western part of Russia.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.628
but you couldn't take a car in then, and your tour was terribly sharply defined.

07:22.470 --> 07:27.157
You know, you were allowed to go just to Thamakambekhah and Tashkets, so I could remember almost nothing else.

07:27.919 --> 07:31.344
And I didn't want that, so I thought, well, I have to leave it.

07:31.364 --> 07:34.549
Do you have a sense of story now you say 6,000 miles?

07:34.830 --> 07:43.624
I mean, you're a pro and you've done a lot of writing, but nevertheless, there must be a feeling of anxiety at the spec.

07:44.077 --> 07:45.599
Will I have a story here?

07:46.881 --> 07:52.508
At what point did the story begin to shape itself for you?

07:52.588 --> 07:55.131
Address yourself specifically to this.

07:55.151 --> 07:57.074
Yes, there's always an anxiety.

07:57.254 --> 07:58.315
And there always has been my books.

07:58.335 --> 08:05.444
And with this one too, you know, I arrived in Ashford, the capital of Turkmenistan, which is a sort of non-city.

08:05.605 --> 08:07.487
It's a kind of nuclear landscape.

08:07.547 --> 08:13.054
It's a lunar landscape in which the Russians built this city quite artificially.

08:13.388 --> 08:21.936
It's very young, the capital of Turkmenistan, a desert land really, and a hundred years ago they had no cities, no towns even.

08:22.657 --> 08:42.096
And so the Russians built this, really, it was literally a military station, but it sort of communist, it looks like a sort of communist blueprint with the typical Marxist things, there's a Lenin square, an ex-Lenin square, and an ex-Marx Avenue, and an ex, well, still a working ballet theater, and so on.

08:42.413 --> 08:45.516
I just got this thing that I'm never going to touch this country.

08:45.576 --> 08:47.799
Here I'm just being served up a Soviet model.

08:48.139 --> 08:53.665
What I want to do is meet the native people and find something real and distinctive here.

08:54.085 --> 08:55.827
And that's happened to me with every one of my books.

08:55.887 --> 08:58.310
I arrive in panic the first two or three days.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.671
I'm not going to make any contact.

09:01.053 --> 09:08.961
The key always seems to just be able to talk to one or two natural people and get a proper insightful conversation, even if it's very brief.

09:09.228 --> 09:12.795
And then I suddenly feel, yes, these people are going to talk to me and it's all right.

09:13.497 --> 09:14.880
That happens to me every time.

09:14.920 --> 09:22.335
And then I begin to feel that I'm going to... I don't worry about the story exactly too much.

09:22.415 --> 09:24.239
I know where I'm going to travel usually.

09:24.499 --> 09:26.764
I leave it flexible, but I know roughly...

09:26.930 --> 09:28.713
the sort of graph that I get to travel about.

09:28.753 --> 09:31.818
It really was scripted in advance, then?

09:31.978 --> 09:33.080
Yes, pretty well.

09:33.421 --> 09:42.957
No, and what it was, because I didn't know what I was going to come upon on the way, and of course if people offer something, or say, why don't you go here, or I've got, my father lives up here, come here, then you take advantage of it.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.883
But in general, I know, you know, like, start in one area and move to another.

09:46.903 --> 09:50.269
Kind of like a jazz piece, I mean, you certainly allow yourself improvisation.

09:50.289 --> 09:51.030
Exactly, yeah.

09:51.145 --> 09:55.611
That's exactly it.

09:57.294 --> 10:09.611
But the fear is less that the story won't develop, because I know I'm going to be traveling on a certain route, it's that it's not going to yield anything up, that I'm not going to feel I've really touched on the sort of reality of people's lives.

10:09.831 --> 10:19.785
That's what, you know, I know, I've studied the history a certain amount, of course, and politics as much as I wanted.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.865
So that was there.

10:22.145 --> 10:25.910
What you fear is that you're just going to remain an outsider always.

10:26.430 --> 10:31.176
It's a sort of paranoia, almost, in the first few days, that you're going to be excluded.

10:32.738 --> 10:36.422
Obviously, human nature is human nature.

10:36.462 --> 10:39.866
There must be a one hand, having done how many travel books now?

10:41.188 --> 10:42.870
Six, yeah.

10:43.571 --> 10:45.553
So there must be a six.

10:46.327 --> 10:51.632
There must be certain similarities on the one hand, but there always must be these exciting discoveries.

10:52.673 --> 10:57.097
I mean, you don't become jaded from having done somebody in the... No.

10:57.818 --> 10:59.219
That's a question, I guess.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.862
No, I haven't yet.

11:01.882 --> 11:05.525
I become jaded towards the end of a long journey.

11:06.426 --> 11:12.452
Then I begin to feel tired, and I feel all sort of sensitivities are blunted.

11:12.736 --> 11:23.871
so that when you start being fascinated by everything, everything seems new and you're full of energy and, you know, pouring down notes, for instance, in the evenings and so on, because everything is so exciting and different.

11:24.512 --> 11:34.525
After a few months, of course, you got used to it all, and it takes something more and more odd or extreme or different to give you that adrenaline again.

11:34.565 --> 11:38.570
Then I think I have a sort of instinct as to when it's time to get home.

11:39.131 --> 11:39.471
You do.

11:39.492 --> 11:40.633
You know when you have a story.

11:41.204 --> 11:49.493
It's like even in a very contracted way, I know here when I have my lead, and I'm always looking for my kicker.

11:49.573 --> 12:09.996
It's a little different than that because of course it's a very extended, but it's more knowing that you've sort of made the touch, you've got through and you've touched people.

12:10.145 --> 12:11.526
and that they're going to talk to you.

12:12.047 --> 12:15.210
And then you can almost let it go.

12:15.270 --> 12:21.696
It goes on being in anxiety with each new situation that you're not going to find anybody who will respond to you.

12:21.736 --> 12:23.858
What most of all would you want to find?

12:23.878 --> 12:39.072
I mean, this is, of course, this is a legendary place, certainly rich in history and through the centuries on the one hand, but I mean, the Silk Road and all this fascinating place.

12:39.406 --> 12:41.568
What did you want?

12:43.150 --> 12:47.956
I knew I'd find the interesting places, because there they were on the map, and I knew I could get to them.

12:48.997 --> 13:08.299
There were one or two more distant ones that I'd only vaguely read about, even in the counts of travelers before the First World War, because there was such a very short time in which this area was accessible, basically between about 1870 and 1910, probably.

13:08.566 --> 13:17.802
It was possible to go there, and quite a lot of travelers, European travelers, and one very good American traveler went there and recounted what they saw.

13:17.822 --> 13:29.282
But before then, it was an uncle Schuller, Eugene Schuller, a lovely book, and much the most detailed and the most sort of reliable and interesting.

13:29.402 --> 13:33.409
He traveled eight months to this area, and he was the best, really.

13:33.997 --> 13:37.501
But before then, people were murdered if they came into this area.

13:37.521 --> 13:38.763
You're lucky to get out with your life.

13:39.344 --> 13:45.191
And after then was the chaos of the First World War and then Bolshevism, which excluded travelers virtually.

13:45.632 --> 13:47.234
So there was just this very short period.

13:47.855 --> 13:56.465
And reading some of these books, fragments of knowledge of places that were there then came up.

13:56.485 --> 13:59.329
But I couldn't be sure that they were still there necessarily.

13:59.444 --> 14:12.080
So, you know, but mainly my concern was with people's identity, with who these people thought they were now, where they thought they were going, where they took their sense of being from.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.124
You certainly don't find a sense of xenophobia there, do you?

14:16.746 --> 14:26.498
No, considering everything, you know, no, considering it's been such an enclosed and cut off part of the world in many ways.

14:26.883 --> 14:30.792
really very little, more sense of curiosity, particularly if you're a Westerner.

14:32.415 --> 14:35.041
Tell me, is this by policy?

14:35.141 --> 14:38.328
I mean, do you shoot photographs while you run these things?

14:38.348 --> 14:38.568
No.

14:39.090 --> 14:45.263
It's partly been necessity, but mainly sort of, with me, a kind of psychological thing.

14:45.563 --> 14:47.785
I quite like not having a camera.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.547
So you don't carry it usually?

14:49.607 --> 14:49.807
No.

14:50.028 --> 14:51.929
You usually be the poorest with a camera.

14:52.230 --> 14:53.811
If you're found with a camera.

14:53.871 --> 14:59.257
I carry cameras on my assignments and I look at it as a professional thing.

14:59.537 --> 15:10.288
I sort of, could I tend to try to be a bit inconspicuous if I can, usually in these even ex-communist countries.

15:10.268 --> 15:36.698
but they usually took me for being a estonian or something you know initially at least yes i think so um but the estonians are rather gaunt like me and speak bad russian so they tend to think i was a bolt or something um but camera tends to sort of slightly highlight the fact that you're separate and watching and different and i was trying to sort of douse that down but the other thing is you know when the police do discover you and

15:36.965 --> 15:38.707
surf through your baggage and stuff.

15:38.747 --> 15:40.369
They find a camera and they don't like it.

15:40.890 --> 15:48.999
All my film in the first trip I did in the Soviet Union was exposed by the KGB and developed very badly and was unusable.

15:49.620 --> 16:01.634
But more important, I think, publishers, I don't know how American publishers are with this, but my British publishers, and I agree with this, tend to feel that what you're doing in these books is trying to let people see through your eyes.

16:02.235 --> 16:04.657
This is a quote I'm looking for.

16:04.678 --> 16:05.959
It might be...

16:06.007 --> 16:10.231
that you're basically painting the picture for them.

16:10.872 --> 16:13.314
And so they're looking, as it were, through your lens.

16:14.095 --> 16:20.642
Whereas a camera, a film, you're giving them back their eyes in a way.

16:21.122 --> 16:24.866
They are seeing what they would if they were standing where the camera lens had been, as it were.

16:25.367 --> 16:28.350
Whereas you're trying to transform the picture.

16:28.370 --> 16:31.133
I mean, everybody sees the same thing differently.

16:31.153 --> 16:33.415
And I would want them, or I suppose they

16:33.800 --> 17:01.258
throws there is inviting people to see through my sort of aesthetic sensibility or historical sense or whatever it may be it's my journey that they're seeing and I suppose you were asking about the differences that say television is from a book and a book is very much asking you to travel with somebody else and the television's not, it's restoring and I think the fact that you are not taking photographs personally it's very important that when you sit, when you

17:03.787 --> 17:08.532
writing this, that what you remember, I mean, your

17:09.068 --> 17:10.310
are far more important.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.893
I mean, that's the stuff that you're going to retain, too, isn't it?

17:12.913 --> 17:16.598
The impressions and the feelings and the visual things.

17:16.999 --> 17:20.123
That's what's going to be translated into that.

17:20.143 --> 17:24.148
Exactly, which is tremendously personal, of course, and everybody's going to have a different love.

17:24.188 --> 17:27.553
Which makes it such a charming, almost dated genre.

17:28.053 --> 17:28.634
A throwback.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.539
I don't want to say dated writing, but this is what they did.

17:32.860 --> 17:36.004
And it's so wonderful to have

17:36.406 --> 18:05.383
people going with yeah in a way you know i feel that travel writing will sort of survive because i mean not only are places changing all the time but the sort of sensibilities and the priorities of every generation of travel writers is changing too i mean people of my generation write with quite different priorities than people of 30 years ago i think you know we tend to be a little more concerned with with ordinary life and um

18:05.752 --> 18:09.576
and less with the sort of grandeur of art and history in a way.

18:09.616 --> 18:19.786
I think if that book had been written by somebody 40 years ago, it's very likely that would be rather more, in England, I mean, rather more sort of history and maybe even philosophy or a little in it or something.

18:20.727 --> 18:31.218
So I reckon even if you don't explore something new geographically, there's usually something to be explored in the way societies have changed.

18:31.238 --> 18:35.522
And I think this brings us quite nicely to the importance of barriers

18:36.059 --> 18:40.846
I mean, a book such as this has to have a story.

18:41.227 --> 18:50.160
I mean, it's not just Colin going off to the heart of Asia and talking about the buildings and the people and the landscape.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.824
There has to be a story here.

18:53.865 --> 18:56.329
And talk a little bit about that.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.083
All right, you're on.

19:03.484 --> 19:04.105
Go ahead.

19:04.125 --> 19:04.826
Yes, probably.

19:05.066 --> 19:06.628
What was the question?

19:06.648 --> 19:10.714
Well, the formulation of the story of the narrative for you.

19:11.636 --> 19:14.760
I suppose... Did you have a sense of this before you were going?

19:14.780 --> 19:16.823
Did it evolve during the... It evolved, really.

19:17.784 --> 19:30.703
I suppose what you realize is that the feeling of unity has to come from yourself, because what you're doing, really, is experiencing a series of fragments.

19:31.055 --> 19:41.566
You know, you're meeting one person this moment, you're looking out at some scenery the next moment, you're trying to get a bus the next moment, you're having a passage of history the next moment, and then you're meeting somebody else.

19:42.066 --> 19:50.035
And all the time, in a way, it's like a chain with a whole lot of different links in it, which build up eventually to a picture.

19:51.196 --> 19:56.381
But I suppose the coordinating link between the chain is only yourself.

19:56.401 --> 19:58.243
You're the one that's doing the journey.

19:58.426 --> 20:02.871
You're the one on which all these events or insights or lack of them are being threaded.

20:03.452 --> 20:11.621
And so it's what happens in you, I suppose, that is, in a way, quite subtly, you hope, the narrative.

20:12.262 --> 20:23.255
In this case, for instance, I've nearly always found in the book that some question comes up, some central idea or question, which gives the coordination to the whole journey.

20:24.436 --> 20:26.779
In the book on China, it was...

20:27.130 --> 20:33.398
but preoccupation with the cruelty that they had dealt one another in the Cultural Revolution, an unease, really.

20:33.718 --> 20:41.468
It sounds very racist, but about the sort of national psyche, the particular kind of cruelty that they visited on one another.

20:42.108 --> 20:46.213
But in this case, quite predictably, it became a matter of the identity.

20:46.714 --> 20:54.083
I was sort of hunting for their identity, really, and it was the development of that theme, I suppose, and my...

20:54.890 --> 21:02.718
only half ability to find it, or to give it to me, that became the real narrative theme.

21:03.178 --> 21:06.321
And how long were you, how long did the trip change?

21:06.341 --> 21:08.603
Very short, it was about, it was less than five months.

21:08.784 --> 21:09.124
Really?

21:10.085 --> 21:16.651
And I think it's significant also that you're a novelist.

21:16.671 --> 21:23.698
So there is this, I mean, there is this sense of, to go back to story and to narrative skills, we are

21:23.864 --> 21:27.930
writing a book that is an art of structure.

21:28.331 --> 21:30.434
It's something I almost sort of take for granted.

21:30.474 --> 21:36.443
I'm not thinking about it really, but I know that when I'm writing it that I'm conscious that it must have a shape.

21:37.304 --> 21:53.027
And the only shape it can really have is that thread of slowly realizing things in the case of this book, slowly having miniature discoveries and revelations, starting out really with a blank, not knowing

21:53.615 --> 22:22.575
in a way how these people thought about themselves or what their future was or how five independent nations would be getting their sense of community of who they were and it's that I suppose bit by bit which is in this case the discovery that this sense of self for these peoples is very thin by our standards you know it's not the Soviet cloak's gone Islam's thinner than one expected the sense of nation is not really there

22:22.960 --> 22:25.923
a sense of sort of clan and extended family.

22:26.664 --> 22:32.630
But I felt all the time in a way that I was looking for something which was more due to my un-ease than to theirs.

22:32.670 --> 22:34.251
They went missing, which they never had.

22:34.792 --> 22:43.621
But me, with a automatic sense of Englishness, I suppose, as you with American-ness would sort of assume that people received their identity from nationhood.

22:44.222 --> 22:45.243
But it wasn't so here.

22:45.263 --> 22:52.630
And I suppose the journey always was, I mean, a rather muted one was this sort of discovery.

22:53.099 --> 22:54.701
or attempt to discover.

22:55.082 --> 23:03.473
When you think, when you recall the trip, the journey, what visual images flashed?

23:03.493 --> 23:05.075
I mean, what do you conjure up?

23:05.455 --> 23:05.996
What do you remember?

23:06.016 --> 23:08.459
Oh, certain very potent things, I suppose.

23:08.479 --> 23:09.941
Mostly people that one met.

23:11.103 --> 23:20.575
I always remember that collective farm director near the Aral Sea sitting under a naked light bulb in a mudvick hut.

23:21.044 --> 23:50.781
the director of a collective farm while all around him the land was so salinated that there was nothing he could do about it and his fight was failing seemed to sort of symbolize the hopelessness of the whole Soviet system in artificially trying to change almost the ecology of the country to suit mega economics knit in with the Soviet Union and that other people I suppose I think of the

23:51.031 --> 24:16.589
the extraordinary Russian woman who I knew in Bukhara, the old Russian lady who had fought in the Second World War, covered in her war medals, still talking about Stalin with reference, but whose husband and whose father had both been killed by Stalin, and yet she still felt she owed an allegiance to the old Soviet Union and despised what was happening now.

24:17.190 --> 24:20.295
That tells you Reims about this sort of mentality.

24:20.663 --> 24:47.937
of these people, or the little old man who I met sitting out in Merv, a tiny little man whose leg had been, who was crippled, his spine had been severed, and who was just carving little medallions for pilgrims who came, and talking still, you would have thought if there was any man, he was sort of guardian of a religious shrine really,

24:48.322 --> 24:51.626
there was anybody who would be looking to Islamic fundamentalism.

24:51.666 --> 24:56.071
It would be this kind of person, completely traditional, looking after a religious shrine.

24:56.812 --> 25:01.918
But the first person said to me, you know, that's all right for those people down there, but we make our own Islam here.

25:02.839 --> 25:04.341
We're Turkic, we're different.

25:05.322 --> 25:06.604
A lot of people like that.

25:06.664 --> 25:13.172
And of course, that man, Oman, who drove me, the Uzbek, for many, many weeks.

25:14.593 --> 25:16.776
I remember him very strongly,

25:17.161 --> 25:23.286
He was a lesson, really, in how not to take people at their certest value.

25:23.867 --> 25:27.590
Underneath this, ma'am, there's a whole complex layer of experience.

25:27.610 --> 25:33.615
And one found that again and again with people that, you know, what you take for granted.

25:33.635 --> 25:40.862
And because our lives are fairly, we were lucky, you don't assume there are great tragedies in the back of most of them.

25:40.922 --> 25:44.885
But with these people, you began to assume that they had tragedies in their lives.

25:45.266 --> 25:46.847
A couple of brief questions.

25:47.350 --> 25:54.742
Have you always had this sense of wanderlust?

25:54.982 --> 25:57.627
What makes a travel writer?

25:57.687 --> 26:02.094
I mean, do you love to—and you do these things by yourself, right?

26:02.114 --> 26:05.379
I mean, you don't take family with you or anything like that.

26:05.399 --> 26:05.660
No, no.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.081
Poor things.

26:06.541 --> 26:09.426
No, I never would.

26:09.642 --> 26:13.087
I've occasionally travelled with girlfriends, but that's just for fun, you know.

26:13.728 --> 26:18.374
When actually writing a book and being serious, it's a bit too tough to take anybody with you, really.

26:18.394 --> 26:20.657
You wouldn't want to impose that on them.

26:20.677 --> 26:33.875
Also, you tend, if you're going with one other person of your own culture, you sort of are going in a bubble of Englishness, in my case, and you're sort of comforting one another and looking out from your bubble, saying, isn't that funny or isn't that humorous or isn't that peculiar?

26:34.395 --> 26:39.362
But if you're alone, you're the peculiar one and you have to get down and understand them and, you know...

26:39.882 --> 27:05.738
make a sort of imaginative leap i've always loved traveling i suppose the root of it is always curiosity you know it's got sheer inquisitiveness about the world and a rather um hyperactive romantic imagination i think which you know is looking for something stranger more beautiful more extraordinary over the horizon i mean that's not so naive to think you're going to quite get it but then when you're there you of course get fascinated by the reality of it

27:06.410 --> 27:07.571
So you don't carry a camera.

27:07.591 --> 27:09.733
You also, I gather, don't carry a tape recorder.

27:09.833 --> 27:15.319
All the conversations are probably reconstructed later that night or whatever it is there.

27:15.399 --> 27:23.126
Yes, I have occasionally taken a tape recorder, but often I feel rather mean sort of putting it on without people knowing.

27:23.587 --> 27:26.469
If they do know you're taping them, of course, they behave in different ways.

27:26.509 --> 27:30.113
They become more theatrical or more defensive or something.

27:30.133 --> 27:32.355
So the conversations are basically reconstructed.

27:32.455 --> 27:33.396
See, they're too artificial.

27:33.545 --> 27:38.632
if you put a tape recorder on with their knowledge, and it seems not a nasty to have one without their knowledge.

27:38.933 --> 27:40.615
So the conversations are reconstructed.

27:40.675 --> 27:47.005
But usually I find that the essential things are the ones that sort of obsessed me.

27:47.025 --> 27:54.396
I think I've remembered fairly well, because occasionally I have taped as well, and then gone back and realized that the things I've noted are the right ones.

27:55.477 --> 27:58.221
And what remains for you?

27:58.321 --> 27:59.383
What places still...

28:00.308 --> 28:01.550
I don't know.

28:01.590 --> 28:04.674
I don't know at the moment.

28:04.695 --> 28:06.597
Usually after a journey is this one.

28:06.657 --> 28:08.059
I feel very exhausted.

28:08.460 --> 28:09.722
And then I go and write a novel.

28:10.683 --> 28:14.910
The novels are much more about a sort of internal landscape in my case.

28:15.010 --> 28:18.655
They're not the natural novels of a travel writer, I think.

28:18.675 --> 28:21.780
They don't take place, many of them in distant countries.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.603
They're more inside my head.

28:24.584 --> 28:30.012
And it's after that sort of novel that I get sick of myself and want to go and see a billion Chinese.

28:30.363 --> 28:33.496
And the trouble will take a long time, you know, because of the language learning.

28:33.536 --> 28:35.565
So that's perhaps two or three years in all.

28:35.585 --> 28:37.774
That is, that is something you impose upon yourself.

28:38.125 --> 28:41.590
Yes, I feel that it's essential to my books to know the language.

28:41.690 --> 28:43.792
If I didn't, I mean, half the book wouldn't be there.

28:44.293 --> 28:45.975
And how do you do this?

28:45.995 --> 28:47.477
I mean, you go to school.

28:47.497 --> 28:48.739
I went to school for Russian.

28:48.899 --> 28:52.364
I had a private tutor for Chinese.

28:52.384 --> 28:52.944
I've been lucky.

28:52.964 --> 28:56.629
I've been able to afford private tutors in the last couple of years, which is wonderful, just getting something.

28:56.649 --> 28:58.131
You've just got to talk, you know.

28:58.432 --> 29:03.478
I mean, my Russian's very ungrammatical, but it's... You're understood.

29:03.498 --> 29:04.480
Yes, it's fairly.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.103
You know, one did a couple of years solid of it.

29:07.268 --> 29:12.619
You know, we're looking at 1026.

29:12.860 --> 29:16.006
I don't think there's any more.

29:16.026 --> 29:20.336
Now you're giving a lecture at the Smithsonian, is that right, or have you done that?

29:20.436 --> 29:21.318
I've done that.

29:21.338 --> 29:25.767
And what are people most interested in?

29:25.966 --> 29:26.527
It varies.

29:27.888 --> 29:32.914
The question always comes up is, is this part of the world going to give us fundamentalist Islam?

29:33.134 --> 29:35.356
You know, and these questions are really answered in the book more.

29:35.416 --> 29:36.297
It's probably the question.

29:36.397 --> 29:38.019
I've stayed away from things in the book.

29:38.039 --> 29:45.768
Yes, well, a lot of them are asking those sort of questions.

29:46.468 --> 29:54.077
Some are interested in the motivation, you know, why you do this, the loneliness, the sheer practical hardships and dangers.

29:54.097 --> 29:55.298
They always want to know if you've been in

29:55.649 --> 29:58.634
danger and the sort of how you confront it.

29:58.654 --> 30:01.278
I mean, I guess danger is there fear, I guess, is more.

30:01.718 --> 30:05.624
Because sometimes maybe even the danger isn't there, but if you're fearful of it, then... Yes.

30:05.965 --> 30:10.973
I usually find more that the danger's there, but the fear isn't.

30:10.993 --> 30:11.774
It's all the peculiar.

30:12.115 --> 30:15.981
I find I get used to it, really.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.645
You begin to accept a certain amount of danger.

30:18.705 --> 30:24.053
And then as the situation gets a little bit more dangerous, like driving into Tajikistan, which is in civil war,

30:24.488 --> 30:29.175
You sort of don't think about it much until you get back home and you think, God, oh, I did that.

30:29.916 --> 30:31.558
Then you feel rather pleased with yourself.

30:31.959 --> 30:35.464
But at the time, it's not a conquest of fear.

30:35.484 --> 30:36.525
I'd like to say it was.

30:36.886 --> 30:40.551
If I fear, very afraid, I don't think I would care.

30:40.571 --> 30:46.159
It is kind of coincidentally curious that the person's at the same place, but there's all this Chechnya thing popping up.

30:46.493 --> 30:50.239
And you have a place that nobody's ever heard of, certainly over here.

30:50.459 --> 30:53.344
Where the hell is Chechnya all of a sudden, you know?

30:53.364 --> 30:59.494
And it is interesting, because all this is a consequence of the disintegration of the Soviets.

30:59.554 --> 31:05.544
Suddenly people are conscious of these places, which have always been stifled before they've been silent.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.367
Would you inscribe this for me, sir?

31:07.427 --> 31:08.248
Of course I would.
