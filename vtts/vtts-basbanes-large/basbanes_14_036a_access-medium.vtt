WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:02.632
Okay, we're on now.

00:02.652 --> 00:05.416
We're talking to... Isn't it nice?

00:07.939 --> 00:10.262
You say it's more important than what I say.

00:10.462 --> 00:13.465
And we're talking to... May I take your card, please?

00:13.485 --> 00:13.726
Sure.

00:13.746 --> 00:16.329
Regina Minutri is how you pronounce her name.

00:16.389 --> 00:16.930
That's correct.

00:18.111 --> 00:21.956
And you would just... Why don't we just enter the conversation?

00:22.016 --> 00:26.121
You said something about a lovely library in Vancouver.

00:26.141 --> 00:27.403
Oh, the new library in Vancouver?

00:27.423 --> 00:31.067
And you said libraries have never been less dead, which I found an interesting...

00:31.587 --> 00:52.336
Yes, I mean, I think what's happening right now, and I think it's going to happen in the future, with all the technology we have, I think people are beginning to recognize that they can't get a handle on it by themselves, that there's too much out there on the Internet.

00:52.416 --> 01:00.227
And they also realize, I believe, that the information that you get on the Internet is just bits and pieces.

01:01.034 --> 01:03.157
Nobody's going to read a book on the Internet.

01:03.257 --> 01:08.444
It takes too long, it's too hard, the screens aren't good enough, etc.

01:08.904 --> 01:14.051
So the Internet provides you with a source or a place to look.

01:14.071 --> 01:14.812
We'll let that go.

01:16.254 --> 01:19.017
No, it'll go into the message pretty soon.

01:19.898 --> 01:29.691
It provides us with a place to look for something, but I think that the collections of materials

01:30.532 --> 01:35.197
that libraries have, are they just going to be with us?

01:35.597 --> 01:47.069
I don't know if you've seen there's a kind of a funny thing called Update on New Technology, about this new thing called B-O-O-K.

01:48.550 --> 01:51.193
I don't have an author for it.

01:51.233 --> 01:53.755
I didn't write it myself, but I've used these things.

01:54.436 --> 01:58.480
And it calls it bound, organized, orderly knowledge and

01:59.354 --> 02:11.541
random access to information, it's linear, you know, you don't need batteries, sand and water resistant, user friendly, cheap.

02:11.993 --> 02:14.257
You know, all this kind of thing.

02:14.277 --> 02:15.959
It goes as fast as you want it to go.

02:15.979 --> 02:16.320
That's right.

02:17.141 --> 02:21.568
And calls it, of course, the new technology that will really take off.

02:21.668 --> 02:23.531
You know, I carried my computer with me.

02:23.551 --> 02:24.673
It's not here with me today.

02:24.693 --> 02:25.374
It's back in the hotel.

02:25.394 --> 02:27.838
But, you know, after two and a half hours, that thing ran out of power.

02:27.958 --> 02:29.100
Right, and a waste of time.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.123
Yeah, a waste of time.

02:31.143 --> 02:31.884
To begin with.

02:32.545 --> 02:39.115
But, you know, what we're seeing here in San Francisco with the dramatic increases in use in the main library...

02:39.702 --> 02:51.658
We see between 6,000 and 7,000 people a day here, which is about 50... It's almost double, maybe, what they were doing in the old Maine.

02:53.901 --> 02:55.843
I worked in Berkeley for 17 years.

02:55.923 --> 02:59.208
I was the library director there and retired in 1994.

03:00.810 --> 03:08.680
We were seeing there, every year, dramatic increases in circulation and use of the library...

03:08.930 --> 03:19.702
in reference questions asked by people, that I think that the only way that libraries will go away is if we let them.

03:21.264 --> 03:28.332
I think that it would be the neglect of librarians and people who are interested in libraries that would make them go away.

03:29.033 --> 03:36.642
Because the public at large is beginning to realize that there's no way they can buy everything they need, even those who are very rich.

03:37.246 --> 03:41.071
can't go out and buy every book they ever wanted to read or ever thought about.

03:41.131 --> 03:43.314
You can't have every CD-ROM that you want.

03:43.874 --> 03:47.539
You can't be on the internet 24 hours a day.

03:48.080 --> 03:58.934
So libraries, in a manner of speaking, provide a guidepost, an indexing device.

04:00.315 --> 04:06.443
Librarians in our own brains, as you put together the

04:07.300 --> 04:09.603
I used to do a lot of work in reader's advisory.

04:09.703 --> 04:12.867
I read a lot of fiction and enjoy it.

04:13.748 --> 04:26.763
And it was always fun to have a patron come up and say, you know, I've just read this new book by whoever, you know, whether it's... A gentleman.

04:26.783 --> 04:27.904
Yeah, right, a gentleman.

04:28.024 --> 04:29.566
What have you got that's like that?

04:29.626 --> 04:31.949
And you think about it and they say, well, now let's see.

04:31.989 --> 04:34.692
I've just read a novel...

04:35.009 --> 04:39.236
about a Neanderthal man appearing in modern-day Europe.

04:39.796 --> 04:41.359
And, oh, that would be interesting.

04:41.399 --> 04:48.550
And you tell the person a little bit about the book in like a 30-second pre-see, and off they go, you know.

04:49.111 --> 04:51.094
And it's a human connection.

04:51.575 --> 04:56.102
And that's the other thing that libraries give to people, is this human connection.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.966
You can come into the library, you can go look in the stacks.

04:58.986 --> 05:00.468
You don't even have to talk to anybody.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.772
But when you do...

05:03.342 --> 05:08.628
you get a real person who cares, for the most part, about what you're looking for and what you're interested in.

05:08.668 --> 05:16.376
And that's why we say the core of our public library services is our service to the individual, to the person.

05:17.236 --> 05:18.197
That's your philosophy.

05:18.258 --> 05:18.718
That's right.

05:19.519 --> 05:20.019
Personally.

05:20.079 --> 05:21.121
Personally.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.102
Mm-hmm.

05:22.142 --> 05:28.929
Some of the anxiety expressed that, you know, I've been talking to everybody, and I'm not going to be coy about that either.

05:28.949 --> 05:33.113
You know, I'm looking to do a comprehensive

05:35.135 --> 05:41.464
examination of the... This is a very interesting case study in San Francisco.

05:41.484 --> 05:52.439
I mean, this is a brand new, gorgeous, beautiful, very expensive facility that was built with a tremendous mandate of the citizenry.

05:53.540 --> 05:56.725
And, you know, some people consider maybe there aren't going to be enough people.

05:56.925 --> 06:01.992
Maybe this is... I saw a tape that was produced for the Library of the Future.

06:02.012 --> 06:04.095
It was almost a robotic voice

06:04.531 --> 06:06.374
Oh, I've seen that tape, yeah.

06:06.394 --> 06:07.255
Isn't that amazing?

06:07.275 --> 06:09.458
Yeah, I didn't care for that tape.

06:09.478 --> 06:12.282
And the librarian was a hologram, you know.

06:12.302 --> 06:13.824
Right, right.

06:13.944 --> 06:26.422
I mean, this comes to mind as you're saying, you know, so there is clearly this perception out there that maybe this library is going to be too dependent on machinery and not dependent enough on the people who you have already worked in.

06:26.442 --> 06:27.083
Not this library.

06:27.123 --> 06:28.465
Are very, very important.

06:28.485 --> 06:29.547
Not this library.

06:30.088 --> 06:33.913
And not any library that I've ever worked in.

06:34.973 --> 06:39.099
You know, you can automate the life out of a library.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.543
It's possible.

06:42.244 --> 06:55.746
But if you automate correctly, you allow staff to have more time to interact with the public.

06:55.886 --> 06:57.108
That's the difference.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.834
It's the appropriate use of technology.

07:01.274 --> 07:03.057
And see, where we haven't gotten yet,

07:03.492 --> 07:15.769
We haven't gotten to the point where this thing, this computer that sits here that I use on a daily basis, is a tool to me just as much as the telephone is.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.212
We haven't reached that stage yet.

07:18.553 --> 07:19.614
This is not a god.

07:19.674 --> 07:20.996
This is not an icon.

07:21.036 --> 07:26.804
This has in it what we put in it and gets out of it what we put into it.

07:27.245 --> 07:29.668
If I put garbage in, I get garbage out.

07:30.003 --> 07:31.725
To quote a phrase.

07:31.745 --> 07:33.766
To quote a phrase that's been quoted a million times.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.608
But it's absolutely true.

07:36.329 --> 07:37.930
This thing is only a tool.

07:38.811 --> 07:40.292
The computer is only a tool.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.315
They're no better than... They're essential.

07:43.575 --> 07:46.057
They're essential to my work, too.

07:46.638 --> 07:51.882
But it's not a... It's not a creative tool.

07:52.723 --> 07:59.689
It's the brain connected to the computer connected to the person that makes the difference.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.533
And that's the way I see libraries.

08:02.593 --> 08:04.155
Now, this library has a lot of problems.

08:04.696 --> 08:05.938
There is no question about that.

08:05.958 --> 08:06.599
It's not big enough.

08:08.782 --> 08:16.333
I mean, do you have any, well, I don't want to jump ahead, because that is certainly something I want to talk about.

08:16.553 --> 08:17.554
I'm sorry.

08:17.855 --> 08:19.076
Well, we don't have enough room.

08:19.938 --> 08:21.780
We have some wonderful, beautiful spaces.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.766
Architecturally, they're very pleasing, no question about it.

08:26.527 --> 08:29.271
But we don't have enough room for all the material we have.

08:30.145 --> 08:32.909
There might be lots of reasons for that.

08:33.130 --> 08:41.864
I don't want to throw any cast dispersions on people for one reason or another, but we have a ton of material in Brooks Hall.

08:41.884 --> 08:43.386
Which I'd like to see, by the way.

08:43.587 --> 08:55.005
I'll have somebody, either I'll do it this morning or I'll have Susan Goldstein, she's coming over at 9.45, take you down.

08:56.183 --> 08:59.786
In Brooks Hall, some people say we have treasures, some people say we do not.

09:00.327 --> 09:01.708
But you certainly have books there.

09:01.728 --> 09:02.829
We have a lot of books there.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.952
We have some books there that are not on the catalog.

09:07.793 --> 09:20.064
Those are being gone through by staff to determine which should be cataloged and put on our catalog and which deserve a life somewhere else, aside from this library.

09:21.225 --> 09:24.368
We have a large collection of periodicals there, bound periodicals.

09:24.854 --> 09:26.316
many of which are broken runs.

09:27.098 --> 09:30.744
So we have to decide what's the best use of these periodicals.

09:32.487 --> 09:37.876
We might have a year and a half of one periodical, you know, that's perhaps not useful to the library.

09:38.196 --> 09:39.839
Ten years of a periodical is.

09:41.862 --> 09:47.171
We have the city archives over there, which were discovered when the city moved out of City Hall.

09:47.191 --> 09:48.313
And all that entailed.

09:48.428 --> 09:50.651
And all that entails, that's right.

09:50.671 --> 09:56.719
An archive is a nice phrase for a piece of paper like this.

09:57.179 --> 10:00.103
We have papers from various mayors.

10:00.123 --> 10:01.886
I think we have Mayor Jordan's papers.

10:01.946 --> 10:04.469
I may be wrong on this.

10:04.950 --> 10:07.713
I think we have Mayor Agnose's papers.

10:10.437 --> 10:11.718
We've got artifacts.

10:12.680 --> 10:18.267
We've got some of the artifacts that were found when they excavated for this building.

10:18.483 --> 10:19.984
We have Mayor Rolf's rug.

10:21.005 --> 10:22.727
I mean, we have a collection of them.

10:22.867 --> 10:23.888
Mayor R-O, how do you spell Rolf?

10:24.368 --> 10:26.670
R-O-L-F-E.

10:27.751 --> 10:28.752
Is he a recent mayor?

10:28.772 --> 10:29.213
Oh, no.

10:29.653 --> 10:39.302
He's the mayor that's in the photograph over there when they excavated to build the old main library in the 19— Yeah, Rolf's first name.

10:39.322 --> 10:43.365
One of the history people can give you his first name.

10:43.806 --> 10:47.529
That's not a priority item.

10:47.549 --> 10:48.490
No.

10:48.638 --> 10:51.382
We have a science fiction collection.

10:51.422 --> 10:56.269
We have a gay and lesbian collection that are in storage waiting to be looked at.

10:57.130 --> 11:06.343
We have a collection of sheet music that the library purchased that we haven't been able to do anything with for lack of staff and time.

11:08.827 --> 11:13.553
We have a wonderful archive of gay and lesbian materials, which I understand you were interested in.

11:14.014 --> 11:16.958
Well, I am, because it is, to me, you know...

11:17.663 --> 11:24.615
one of the great opportunities for this city and this library to document and preserve.

11:24.655 --> 11:26.738
This is an interest of mine, you know.

11:28.401 --> 11:29.743
If you don't preserve it, who will?

11:29.924 --> 11:31.887
That's right, that's right.

11:31.907 --> 11:41.744
And we have, not only do we have a collection of gay and lesbian material that was given to us, that has to be gone... By an individual?

11:41.844 --> 11:42.625
Yeah, in Florida.

11:42.908 --> 11:44.009
Do you know the name?

11:44.270 --> 11:45.191
No, I don't have the name.

11:46.452 --> 11:48.595
But Susan Goldstein probably will.

11:49.215 --> 11:51.218
Jim Van Buskirk will, if nobody else.

11:51.238 --> 11:52.259
Are you going to talk to Jim?

11:52.579 --> 11:53.881
I'd like to.

11:54.001 --> 11:55.262
I've blocked the whole name.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.424
Okay, he's not here today.

11:56.444 --> 12:00.048
I would have had him come up and talk to you, but he's not here today.

12:00.128 --> 12:00.949
Will he be here tomorrow?

12:01.109 --> 12:02.090
Yeah.

12:02.110 --> 12:04.153
Yeah.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.155
Anyway, he's the head of the Gay and Lesbian Senate.

12:06.175 --> 12:09.439
He can give you more information on that.

12:10.432 --> 12:18.539
So, to all intents and purposes, we have this beautiful-looking building here, which isn't holding the collections.

12:19.961 --> 12:24.745
And one, you could argue that they didn't have enough shelves, that the architect won.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.708
The architect won.

12:27.728 --> 12:31.772
That's kind of a catchphrase that librarians use.

12:32.232 --> 12:36.316
If the building doesn't come out exactly the way librarians like it, say the architect won.

12:36.376 --> 12:38.818
I've been to the French library, by the way, so, yeah.

12:39.457 --> 12:42.542
It's gorgeous, but— The architect won.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.405
The architect won.

12:44.425 --> 12:51.495
And that's not to downgrade architecture, but it's—we, as a librarian, I look at things with a different viewpoint.

12:52.517 --> 13:03.574
I wish that we could have another 30,000 linear feet of shelving in here, but I don't see that that's possible.

13:04.415 --> 13:18.969
I think that we are going to be in a permanent situation of having to store material in Brooks Hall, which, while it's not attractive, isn't harmful to the material, as far as we can determine now.

13:19.510 --> 13:22.833
Well, you'll probably have to do some environmental things, I would imagine.

13:22.853 --> 13:32.683
Well, we test the humidity and the relative humidity and the temperature frequently, and it's staying within tolerance limits so far.

13:33.322 --> 13:38.009
I don't know what's going to happen with El Nino, the rain situation.

13:39.231 --> 13:53.191
What I want to do over there is get some funding to drop a ceiling, to put up some walls, and to put in some environmental controls if we're going to keep the city archives in there particularly, because these are materials that are fragile.

13:54.533 --> 13:58.158
The bound periodicals don't require special treatment necessarily.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.805
The books that we are discarding because they're no longer needed

14:03.258 --> 14:07.263
you know, 12th and 13th copies of things, things that are falling apart.

14:07.943 --> 14:10.146
We just have to get them out of the building eventually.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.009
I don't have a problem with that, by the way.

14:13.049 --> 14:14.011
You can't keep everything.

14:14.571 --> 14:15.552
Well, you can't keep everything.

14:15.572 --> 14:18.396
No, well, some people think we should, but we can't.

14:18.736 --> 14:24.643
You know, this is, you hear this everywhere, and I don't think that's, well, anyway, we're jumping ahead.

14:24.663 --> 14:24.883
Yeah.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.347
So we have to work out a solution to the Brooks Hall.

14:29.108 --> 14:30.750
I'm not sure if this thing is going, but it's fine.

14:31.692 --> 14:36.578
So we need to work out a solution to the Brooks Hall issues.

14:37.960 --> 14:44.188
We also need to see how we can maximize library shelving in this building right now.

14:45.570 --> 14:51.737
And we have a lot of compact shelving on each floor in the non-public areas.

14:52.739 --> 14:54.281
And that does help a lot.

14:56.704 --> 15:00.889
But we're trying to get as much as possible out on the floor.

15:01.493 --> 15:03.375
so the public has access to it.

15:04.357 --> 15:07.701
You know, that's basically where we are in terms of that.

15:10.264 --> 15:11.966
Backtrack just a second.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.489
You wish you had 30,000 additional.

15:14.549 --> 15:15.851
Did you say linear feet?

15:16.091 --> 15:17.372
Linear feet of shelter.

15:17.393 --> 15:19.215
So that's five miles or six miles.

15:19.235 --> 15:19.395
Yeah.

15:20.416 --> 15:21.858
If I had that, I'd have enough.

15:21.878 --> 15:24.942
So what you're saying is they're six miles short here.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.585
What I'm saying is there's no room for growth.

15:28.662 --> 15:29.203
At all.

15:29.223 --> 15:30.464
That's a great concern, isn't it?

15:30.484 --> 15:32.487
It's a huge concern.

15:32.607 --> 15:39.296
You build a building... The building was full when it opened.

15:41.199 --> 15:45.465
When you build a building like this, you build for at least 20 years of growth.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.310
Or at least that's what I'm planning.

15:49.350 --> 15:52.615
I'll digress a little bit.

15:53.015 --> 15:54.858
I retired three years ago from Berkeley.

15:54.938 --> 15:56.560
We just passed a bond measure in

15:56.945 --> 16:10.186
November to enlarge and seismically retrofit and refurbish our central library, which is a national landmark building.

16:11.428 --> 16:19.300
And they're planning for at least a 30 percent increase in shelving.

16:20.201 --> 16:22.445
Now, they say here there was a half again.

16:22.645 --> 16:25.129
I mean, they said they had a 50 percent increase in shelving.

16:25.902 --> 16:33.149
What happened, I think, was that they found all kinds of materials squirreled away that they didn't realize they had.

16:33.989 --> 16:34.350
Over there?

16:34.810 --> 16:43.979
Over there, in remote storage, things that were out in the 1989 earthquake, things that were suddenly given to the library, new collections that came in.

16:44.659 --> 16:45.480
That's what I've heard.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.242
I believe some of it.

16:48.263 --> 16:49.484
I know the archives were new.

16:49.764 --> 16:49.944
Yeah.

16:51.265 --> 16:54.889
Of course, the archives are still over there.

16:54.909 --> 16:55.369
They're not here.

16:56.412 --> 16:57.153
You're in Brooks Hall.

16:59.116 --> 17:00.598
Brooks Hall is downstairs, frankly.

17:00.838 --> 17:09.271
Had you been in a loop, let's say, you know— You mean if I had been here at the time it was being designed?

17:11.033 --> 17:11.774
Yeah.

17:12.295 --> 17:14.759
Would you have liked all that glass and space?

17:17.382 --> 17:17.923
Probably not.

17:19.545 --> 17:20.086
Probably not.

17:20.307 --> 17:25.474
I would probably have gone for a more mundane approach with floors straight across.

17:26.112 --> 17:29.015
I do understand why.

17:29.035 --> 17:31.737
I mean, it is a grand space.

17:31.817 --> 17:32.758
It's a beautiful space.

17:32.798 --> 17:34.700
It doesn't have to be six floors high, however.

17:36.061 --> 17:38.103
You know, but I can't... I wasn't here.

17:38.263 --> 17:45.270
It's too hard to... I'm not even asking... I'm not mentioning personality.

17:45.310 --> 17:45.690
Yeah.

17:45.750 --> 17:46.691
No, no, I know you're not.

17:47.472 --> 17:54.358
But you never know what decision you're going to make when you're in the middle of the fray.

17:55.199 --> 17:55.579
You know?

17:56.437 --> 17:59.400
I like the exterior of the building.

18:00.901 --> 18:01.822
I do like the atrium.

18:01.842 --> 18:03.303
It makes you feel good when you walk in.

18:03.323 --> 18:18.358
I wish, however, that the Larkin Street entrance and the Fulton Street entrance were better designed so that we could utilize that space for library materials.

18:19.298 --> 18:26.325
As we are now, because of our security requirements, we have to control the entrance and the exit.

18:26.643 --> 18:32.449
And so the main entrance is turned into the Grove Street entrance, rather than the Larkin Street entrance.

18:32.489 --> 18:39.297
The Larkin Street entrance was the one that was proposed to be the grand main entrance to the library, and that's not working.

18:39.937 --> 18:43.521
The acoustics are wonderful.

18:43.541 --> 18:44.122
I don't mean the cube either.

18:44.142 --> 18:45.443
Well, they're hard surfaces.

18:46.244 --> 18:56.295
I understand if we were to put some sort of sound-absorbing material underneath the... When you look up from the first floor, there's a...

18:57.288 --> 19:25.945
the periodical room juts out and that is where I from what I understand the sound engineers say the sound just kind of bounces ricochets on and off and if we had some sound observing material which could be paint which could be a spray thing that it would significantly lessen it also if they had

19:26.279 --> 19:34.392
maintained the windows till lower down in the building, we wouldn't have quite so much coming up.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.998
The problem we face is we have what we have.

19:39.641 --> 19:53.063
And let me just interrupt Jacqueline Sanson, who is in charge of the collections of the French Library, and she's been around for a while.

19:53.735 --> 19:58.781
And I said, you know, there's been tremendous criticism in the press about this place.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.342
You know, you've got glass.

20:00.403 --> 20:01.744
The books are up here.

20:02.425 --> 20:05.949
You know, you have to bring the books from the skyscrapers down.

20:08.071 --> 20:09.233
How do you react to this?

20:09.313 --> 20:19.004
And she said, you know, this country spent two billion francs on this as a commitment to our national library.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.426
And this is what I have to work with.

20:21.446 --> 20:22.948
She said, I can't.

20:23.198 --> 20:28.587
I can't take the time to talk about something that I have no control over.

20:28.607 --> 20:32.433
This is what they've given me, this is what I have to work with, and I'm going to make the best of it.

20:32.754 --> 20:33.615
I love that answer.

20:33.996 --> 20:35.639
That's my answer, too.

20:35.659 --> 20:37.141
What can that woman possibly move?

20:37.342 --> 20:38.544
This is what I've got.

20:38.764 --> 20:40.848
Like what Popeye says, I am what I am.

20:40.868 --> 20:45.996
And we have to make the best possible use of it.

20:46.437 --> 20:49.442
We need to, in some way, I think...

20:50.215 --> 20:57.091
work with the material in Brooks Hall, which for us is easy to get to because it's right off our loading dock.

20:58.113 --> 21:01.281
And we can page those materials for the public.

21:02.063 --> 21:06.132
It's a shame they're not out there for the public to get to, but...

21:06.179 --> 21:06.740
That's life.

21:07.240 --> 21:07.480
That's life.

21:07.640 --> 21:12.325
You know, I can say I would have done it differently, but that's also life.

21:12.345 --> 21:12.805
That's history.

21:12.906 --> 21:15.228
You're damn lucky to have Brooks Hall, though.

21:15.248 --> 21:16.349
We're damn lucky to have it.

21:16.369 --> 21:18.391
We're damn lucky to have it so close and easy.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.393
Yeah, I mean, what if?

21:20.513 --> 21:21.374
You didn't have that.

21:21.574 --> 21:23.176
I have no idea what we'd do.

21:23.676 --> 21:35.848
I think we would have to, you know, Mayor Brown suggested several months ago that the Asian Art Museum not move into the old main library and we keep it.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.392
That's not a bad idea.

21:37.412 --> 21:40.937
Well, it's not going to happen.

21:41.418 --> 21:44.142
I've covered politics before in my earlier life.

21:44.342 --> 21:50.411
No, that's not going to happen because the Asian Art Museum, I mean, there's already been contracts signed.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.334
It's on its way.

21:53.055 --> 21:55.138
But we're lucky we have Brooks Hall.

21:55.158 --> 21:58.744
The challenge is to make Brooks Hall usable.

21:59.224 --> 22:04.452
I don't think we can make it a public space because of the way entrances are.

22:05.005 --> 22:06.286
to that space.

22:07.247 --> 22:12.112
But we can make it a space from which material can be retrieved, and that's important.

22:13.313 --> 22:19.860
I'm sure we can arrange a 24-hour, you know, 24-hour turnaround for people, perhaps even quicker.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.263
But I wouldn't want to guarantee anything but 24 hours at this point.

22:23.283 --> 22:25.946
And now, where are you now in terms of?

22:25.986 --> 22:32.272
I'm in my fifth week here, so I'm in the middle of finding out what's going on.

22:32.312 --> 22:34.354
I'm also in the middle of a budget crisis.

22:34.874 --> 22:37.919
And so my attention is extremely fragmented.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.424
And fragile, I thought you were going to say fragile.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.487
A little fragile, but fragmented.

22:44.508 --> 22:45.370
Frayed, perhaps.

22:45.390 --> 22:45.690
Schizo.

22:47.293 --> 22:47.453
Oh, yes.

22:47.473 --> 22:49.396
Yeah, right.

22:50.838 --> 22:53.362
So we're adding, we've ordered some more shelving.

22:53.522 --> 22:57.488
You probably may have read about our shelving backlog that we had.

22:59.391 --> 23:00.753
That was really bad.

23:00.773 --> 23:03.717
I think we're now down to where we are current.

23:04.810 --> 23:08.134
in every area in which we have space to shelf.

23:10.077 --> 23:11.859
And we're doing a major shift.

23:11.899 --> 23:14.683
We're just completing a major shift of books.

23:14.703 --> 23:21.751
Just about every book in this library will be moved, aside from the first stop down on the first floor in the children's room.

23:21.772 --> 23:24.795
Just about everything else has been shifted and moved in some way.

23:24.835 --> 23:25.937
According to a new scheme?

23:25.957 --> 23:28.440
According to a new scheme with adding shelving.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.962
What kind of a scheme?

23:29.982 --> 23:31.924
In this subject category?

23:32.045 --> 23:32.685
No, no, no, no.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.007
They're still in Dewey order.

23:34.527 --> 23:46.646
But we added some shelving and we're moving things around because, well, you take like the 900s, 910s travel, 920s biography.

23:46.926 --> 23:51.693
The 900s is the biggest possible section of Dewey.

23:52.194 --> 23:59.806
They were shelves were so tight that the books that were out in the 900 couldn't be shelved back on those shelves because there wasn't any place to put them.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.610
So we had to add some shelving and we

24:03.012 --> 24:06.117
We've found shelving from the old main, and we've brought it over here.

24:06.177 --> 24:06.858
We've used it.

24:06.898 --> 24:09.403
We've put new panels in front of it.

24:09.443 --> 24:10.244
It looks fine.

24:11.186 --> 24:20.120
And we'll be, I think they should be completing that shift next week or the week after.

24:20.181 --> 24:28.935
We've got some shelving coming in that we had to purchase, and the completion of the shift depends on when this new shelving arrives here and is put up.

24:29.523 --> 24:38.156
But once that happens, we should be current on our shelving everywhere, and we should be shelving within 72 hours of a book being returned.

24:38.216 --> 24:38.837
That's our goal.

24:39.017 --> 24:41.220
Do you have a sense of how many books are in this building now?

24:41.681 --> 24:42.482
In this building?

24:42.642 --> 24:43.824
Oh, over half a million.

24:44.124 --> 24:44.425
Easy.

24:45.707 --> 24:51.656
Probably about... I'd have to... Frankly, my answer to that won't be accurate.

24:52.036 --> 24:54.720
But is this something that we could follow up on, maybe...

24:55.038 --> 24:59.563
Oh, yeah, you can... It's a valid question.

24:59.683 --> 25:01.445
It's a sure valid question.

25:01.465 --> 25:08.012
If the building is full and it was filled basically the day it opened, so how many books are we talking about?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.754
A lot.

25:09.774 --> 25:13.098
Yeah, a lot, but how many in Brooks Hall?

25:13.258 --> 25:22.969
Well, Brooks Hall has about 75,000 ground periodicals

25:23.911 --> 25:35.510
and about 10,000 or 15,000 books, and then there's those special collections, maybe another 10,000 books.

25:35.710 --> 25:39.316
I'll add about 100,000, plus or minus.

25:39.577 --> 25:46.628
So half a million, and this tape I'm going back to, with Kandala that's quoted on it,

25:47.063 --> 25:50.687
He projected two and a half million items in this new book.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.450
Items, yes.

25:52.590 --> 25:53.631
Items are real different.

25:53.811 --> 25:58.037
Okay, I think you said books, but I'll grant them the items.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.080
It won't be two and a half million items here.

26:01.120 --> 26:01.921
I don't think so.

26:01.941 --> 26:06.747
I can give you the square feet.

26:06.767 --> 26:07.068
Okay.

26:07.809 --> 26:08.229
Give me anything.

26:08.249 --> 26:08.950
Oh, here we go.

26:08.990 --> 26:15.298
Now, 376

26:15.953 --> 26:23.040
376,000 usable square feet, 36 miles of stacks.

26:24.121 --> 26:26.604
That figure was challenged.

26:26.624 --> 26:27.565
Yeah, that I don't know.

26:27.585 --> 26:39.778
36 miles probably includes all the compact shovels, I would think.

26:39.798 --> 26:43.902
But it's supposed to go to an

26:44.624 --> 26:47.167
It's supposed to go to an 8.3 earthquake.

26:48.208 --> 27:00.281
Let's see if anything else has anything more on here.

27:00.301 --> 27:02.643
It says here, in addition to more than a million books.

27:04.525 --> 27:07.809
But you don't think there's a million books?

27:07.829 --> 27:08.430
That could be.

27:09.270 --> 27:09.751
Let's see.

27:12.594 --> 27:14.496
I know I had at Berkeley

27:15.252 --> 27:23.442
With 37,500 usable square feet, we had 250,000, so it could be a million here.

27:25.584 --> 27:30.590
But I don't have anything that tells me that right here in front of me as a statistic.

27:30.610 --> 27:33.594
At some point, this book is going to be published in 1999.

27:34.135 --> 27:35.056
We can get that for you.

27:35.076 --> 27:36.998
This is not something I'm writing on deadline.

27:37.278 --> 27:38.320
We can get that for you.

27:38.340 --> 27:39.941
But, you know, I think it's an important figure.

27:40.302 --> 27:44.567
I know there's about 100,000 plus or minus in Brooks Hall.

27:44.969 --> 27:46.891
Okay.

27:47.112 --> 27:48.754
What do you see as your role here?

27:48.954 --> 28:00.368
I mean, you've already said on record that you really, and your card says acting city librarian, and you see yourself as an interim person.

28:00.569 --> 28:00.809
Yeah.

28:01.330 --> 28:03.913
Although I think there's love for you to stay.

28:03.993 --> 28:07.197
I'm not betraying anything that's happening.

28:07.683 --> 28:09.265
I mean, let's put it this way.

28:09.305 --> 28:11.107
I asked Coulter, how's the search going?

28:11.127 --> 28:12.428
And, you know, what search?

28:12.448 --> 28:15.291
I mean, you know, they're very happy, it seems to me.

28:15.311 --> 28:18.855
Well, so far, I haven't killed anybody and nobody's killed me.

28:18.975 --> 28:19.936
Let's put it that way.

28:20.536 --> 28:24.441
But I retired three years ago and I enjoy being retired.

28:24.801 --> 28:25.582
You're a young woman.

28:25.942 --> 28:26.663
I'm 60.

28:26.883 --> 28:28.605
Well, I'm 54.

28:28.625 --> 28:29.826
No, I'm not that young.

28:31.148 --> 28:35.492
No, I see my role here as a couple of things.

28:35.612 --> 28:36.373
First of all,

28:37.602 --> 28:43.810
trying to do a little bit of bridging and healing over what had happened.

28:44.191 --> 28:47.415
And I know that sounds a little touchy-feely, but basically it is.

28:47.516 --> 29:00.413
It's kind of mending the fences with the staff and improving communication, being a little more open about communication, about everything.

29:00.934 --> 29:02.616
When I know something, I tell somebody.

29:02.716 --> 29:06.141
If I don't know it, I tell you I don't know it.

29:07.319 --> 29:14.009
Improving communication with the branch libraries, paying attention to the branch libraries, which have kind of been neglected over the last couple of years.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.394
The branches are 70% of our business.

29:18.376 --> 29:24.625
You know, this is a busy building, yeah, but out there in this city there are 26 branch libraries, and they're all busy too.

29:25.066 --> 29:28.211
Well, there was a proposal to close a good many of them.

29:28.231 --> 29:29.633
You don't close branch libraries.

29:30.274 --> 29:31.015
Not in this town.

29:31.923 --> 29:33.064
It's like closing schools.

29:33.545 --> 29:34.386
But it was on the table, therefore.

29:34.406 --> 29:37.649
It was on the table a number of years ago.

29:39.271 --> 29:42.034
In truth, we have many branches that are very close to one another.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.438
And if you were starting all over again, you might not have that many.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.021
But we're not starting all over again.

29:49.281 --> 29:49.742
They're here.

29:49.922 --> 29:50.943
They have constituents.

29:51.003 --> 29:52.365
The constituents are active.

29:52.705 --> 29:54.467
The citizens are willing to pay for them.

29:55.288 --> 29:56.389
The citizens use them.

29:56.509 --> 29:59.432
Ergo, they get them.

30:01.471 --> 30:04.714
We have about 10 o'clock.

30:05.054 --> 30:09.118
There are a number of areas I want to cover.

30:09.318 --> 30:10.800
I see myself as an interim, yes.

30:12.562 --> 30:14.303
But I don't see myself as a caretaker.

30:15.464 --> 30:21.130
I see myself as an interim person who is trying to move the library ahead.

30:22.151 --> 30:25.494
What I say to people is, okay, we spilled the milk on the floor.

30:25.514 --> 30:26.014
It stinks.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.276
Let's clean it up and move on.

30:28.277 --> 30:29.858
That's basically my attitude.

30:30.226 --> 30:35.372
If there are processes that need to be put in place that make things work better, let's do that.

30:36.113 --> 30:40.238
If there are things that have to be done that make things work better, we'll look at it.

30:40.318 --> 30:43.001
If there are procedures that need to be changed, let's look at that.

30:43.421 --> 30:45.944
We have policies we need to adopt, let's deal with that.

30:46.966 --> 30:53.854
I'm working with the foundation for funding to do things that city funding can't do for us.

30:54.775 --> 30:57.498
I'm working with the commission on policies.

30:57.858 --> 30:59.220
I'm working with the staff.

30:59.470 --> 31:02.714
on bringing everybody back together and understanding what's happening.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.276
I think it's going to take a year.

31:06.239 --> 31:06.339
Okay.

31:06.359 --> 31:18.654
Steve Coulter indicated, almost even without my pressing the issue, but he feels that a lot of the problem here is with the unionized librarians.

31:18.935 --> 31:21.959
I mean, he had some pretty harsh words to say about them.

31:21.979 --> 31:24.382
He's had some, they've had some difficulties.

31:24.402 --> 31:26.604
And he repeated the white women thing.

31:26.624 --> 31:28.667
I said, geez, you really want to, I mean, I've seen that conversation.

31:28.934 --> 31:33.240
Oh, that was a quote that he— And he repeated it, and he said, that's fine, I stand by it.

31:33.460 --> 31:36.304
And so I said, well, those are your words.

31:37.525 --> 31:44.714
I think that— I wonder if that's the way to get things fixed, though.

31:44.734 --> 31:53.446
Well, I believe that Mr. Coulter has been a very strong chair of the commission, and a very effective chair of the commission.

31:54.447 --> 31:57.591
I think that Ken Dallin did not help the situation.

31:58.246 --> 32:02.671
I think that the union got involved, and in some instances the union was correct.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.034
I think that the commission has been embattled.

32:07.315 --> 32:14.683
I think that there are issues with which the commission and the union has differed.

32:16.325 --> 32:20.969
One might not say that the union was right every time or the commission was right every time.

32:21.069 --> 32:26.515
I think there was a lot of, hey, here the union might have had a really good point.

32:27.085 --> 32:28.967
Well, here the commission has a good point.

32:28.987 --> 32:29.648
You know what I mean?

32:29.768 --> 32:31.130
Not everybody's right.

32:31.390 --> 32:32.351
Like the BART strike.

32:33.092 --> 32:36.937
It isn't all BART management, and it's not all BART employees.

32:36.957 --> 32:38.258
I'm glad nobody's asked me.

32:38.278 --> 32:42.763
You know, from the East Coast, I say, I don't stick my nose at other people's labor problems.

32:42.824 --> 32:43.544
Yeah, you got it.

32:43.604 --> 32:48.370
I am trying to work very closely with the union to resolve some issues.

32:49.371 --> 32:55.118
And what I've found, and I have a lot of experience with unionized libraries,

32:55.705 --> 32:57.608
about 15 years of it in Berkeley.

32:58.569 --> 33:15.656
And I found that if you talk to them regularly, if you ask for their input before you do something, if you give them a chance to tell you their side of the story before something happens, then you're not always going to agree.

33:15.676 --> 33:17.358
You'll always have differences.

33:18.179 --> 33:23.788
But you won't have the kind of clash that I've been seeing taking place here.

33:24.157 --> 33:27.060
Well, there is concern about staff reductions.

33:27.360 --> 33:27.880
That's right.

33:28.381 --> 33:31.324
And I guess there have been staff reductions.

33:31.504 --> 33:34.547
There have been what is commonly called attrition.

33:35.327 --> 33:38.991
And that means when somebody resigns or retires, you don't replace them.

33:39.872 --> 33:44.056
And I'm in a budget crisis right now where I can't hire anybody.

33:46.498 --> 33:47.679
Literally, I cannot.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.302
I'm going to have to do some shifting around.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.003
I'm going to have to

33:52.405 --> 34:02.020
take some real hard looks and maybe do some reorganization in the main library and put more people out on public desks that maybe haven't been.

34:03.142 --> 34:07.408
And I have to work out something with the mayor's office.

34:07.468 --> 34:09.792
I'm working with the mayor and the controller right now.

34:09.832 --> 34:11.334
We have a $3 million problem.

34:11.935 --> 34:12.797
That's a lot of money.

34:14.499 --> 34:20.168
And over $2 million of it, like $2.1 million in staff.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.629
That's what I need.

34:23.370 --> 34:30.439
I need another $2.1 million today to have the kind of staffing that we think we need.

34:31.320 --> 34:36.847
Do you have a number of what your staff is?

34:36.927 --> 34:50.644
Right now, we say our full-time equivalent is about 540, plus or minus, with about 870 people, because we have a lot of people who work part-time.

34:51.755 --> 34:58.983
And we need another 40 or so positions, full-time equivalent.

34:59.043 --> 35:00.144
I don't think we're going to get it.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.548
I think if I'm lucky, I'll get half of it.

35:06.231 --> 35:10.555
Mr. Coulter also suggested this problem with Reshelman.

35:11.756 --> 35:16.902
He suggested that it might even have been, in his word, a case of sabotage.

35:17.489 --> 35:22.957
I don't think so.

35:26.141 --> 35:28.424
I don't think anybody's looking to protect their jobs.

35:29.025 --> 35:30.747
I think that they were overwhelmed.

35:32.369 --> 35:34.813
I think that there wasn't enough space to put the books back.

35:36.095 --> 35:45.187
And I think that they were just totally overwhelmed by the popularity of this building when it first opened in last April.

35:45.828 --> 35:46.669
I think that

35:46.750 --> 35:54.744
They had planned for a significant increase in business, but they didn't envision the type of increase that they got.

35:57.348 --> 36:02.677
And I think right now they are doing, I think we're really working very well.

36:02.737 --> 36:08.006
We've just hired 40 new pages, and we need those.

36:08.307 --> 36:11.492
That was a special dispensation, by the way, from the mayor's office.

36:11.759 --> 36:16.104
And are these distinct from the category of shelvers?

36:16.305 --> 36:17.386
These are pages.

36:17.586 --> 36:18.627
We don't have shelvers.

36:18.868 --> 36:19.548
But they were going to be.

36:20.009 --> 36:21.150
We don't have going to be.

36:21.190 --> 36:22.052
We have pages.

36:22.112 --> 36:23.413
We have library pages.

36:23.954 --> 36:26.137
That is not under discussion at this moment.

36:27.258 --> 36:31.203
Because I can see where that would be a problem.

36:31.383 --> 36:34.347
Well, if you created a new class, you'd have a two-tier system.

36:35.208 --> 36:37.290
Now, you could create a new class.

36:37.871 --> 36:39.673
You could have a two-tier system.

36:40.075 --> 36:49.892
But you'd have to carefully delineate what the lower-paid individuals do that differentiates them from the higher-paid individuals.

36:49.992 --> 36:52.797
Because I don't believe in two-tier pay arrangements.

36:52.897 --> 36:55.883
I think you have equal pay for equal work, frankly.

36:55.903 --> 36:57.526
The Supreme Court seems to like it.

36:58.407 --> 36:59.669
The EPS guys won that one, too.

36:59.689 --> 37:01.813
Yeah, right.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.133
In all honesty, we pay our library pages a lot of money.

37:07.755 --> 37:10.097
It's $12.30 to start.

37:10.117 --> 37:11.799
That's very good.

37:12.119 --> 37:20.068
It's very good money if you are a student and there's nothing better if you're a student.

37:20.388 --> 37:28.577
And most of our jobs are 15 hours a week, so they're really not designed for people using this as a lifelong job.

37:29.401 --> 37:33.185
Although we have a few full-time people.

37:33.586 --> 37:36.188
It's a hell of a job, right.

37:36.529 --> 37:43.636
I worked for this library when I went to college, but they paid me two and a quarter.

37:45.759 --> 37:50.043
But at any rate, no, I'm not entering into that one yet.

37:51.004 --> 37:53.587
We've just got to get the new pages and get the books done.

37:53.627 --> 37:57.231
But they're really almost finished with the shift.

37:57.397 --> 38:05.968
We've got to talk about, you know, your attitude on deaccessioning and the books that went, you know, the infamous landfill situation.

38:05.988 --> 38:07.770
Oh, God only knows what happened with those.

38:07.850 --> 38:08.511
I wasn't here.

38:08.591 --> 38:12.256
I'm not even going to be... I can't be responsible for what was done.

38:12.716 --> 38:14.218
Your reaction to it?

38:15.159 --> 38:22.508
Well, I understand... See, this is... In every other library where I've worked, in the library, discarded material.

38:22.548 --> 38:26.273
Now, there is some material that you discard...

38:26.793 --> 38:31.580
that you hold like this with two fingers of one hand and dump into a trash can.

38:32.361 --> 38:39.491
There are other materials that are in fairly good condition that you discard because they're not popular anymore.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.632
You don't have room for them.

38:41.834 --> 38:46.140
And in every other library I've worked, the friends of the library take those and they resell them.

38:46.701 --> 38:47.562
And there's no issue.

38:48.704 --> 38:50.206
You know, the public doesn't get angry.

38:50.246 --> 38:51.788
The public is perfectly happy.

38:52.510 --> 38:54.934
with seeing the books getting used again.

38:54.974 --> 38:57.599
The public doesn't like to see you throw away books.

38:59.222 --> 39:06.635
Here, the friends of the library have found that in their book sales, they can't sell library discards.

39:08.117 --> 39:10.441
And so they don't accept library discards from us.

39:11.583 --> 39:16.071
So we have this mountain of library discards happening.

39:17.468 --> 39:24.017
I'm looking into whether or not South Africa needs books that they might be able to use from us that we would be happy to ship to them.

39:25.098 --> 39:25.679
At their expense, probably.

39:25.699 --> 39:26.981
Other friends will even pay for it.

39:28.083 --> 39:28.643
Bosnia.

39:29.725 --> 39:31.287
You're actively looking into it?

39:31.467 --> 39:32.849
We're just beginning to look at this.

39:32.909 --> 39:34.351
I've asked staff to look into it.

39:36.053 --> 39:44.325
We have this Adopt-a-Book program here where a local group can come in and go through the discars and pick what they want.

39:44.805 --> 39:46.648
That's not been really successful.

39:47.084 --> 39:59.747
And what I find happens with that, somewhere they always find some sort of treasure, and, you know, then big headlines in the newspaper, library discards treasures, you know, this kind of... I've talked to a few of these people.

40:00.809 --> 40:03.314
You know, some of them are treasures, some of them are not.

40:03.855 --> 40:07.381
No, I actually have not seen a real treasure yet.

40:07.401 --> 40:09.345
I haven't either.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.527
But I happen to...

40:10.827 --> 40:12.351
have an eye for treasures, you know.

40:13.735 --> 40:15.359
I wrote a book on that set.

40:15.379 --> 40:15.600
Right.

40:16.041 --> 40:21.094
And people love, people find fascinating things in bookstores that are treasures, you know.

40:21.415 --> 40:22.478
They buy for a buck.

40:22.839 --> 40:26.188
But what bothers me, I guess, is nobody can tell you the title.

40:26.308 --> 40:27.030
I mean, there's

40:27.213 --> 40:31.459
There doesn't even seem to be a record of the books that were... Probably not.

40:31.499 --> 40:35.224
I don't want people who went to Auschwitz and we can use people a record of the name.

40:35.684 --> 40:38.809
I mean, a book is a living thing to a lot of us.

40:39.450 --> 40:47.180
Well, I'll tell you, once you discard something, first of all, if it's on the... It doesn't seem like it was systematic discarding.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.922
It seems like it was wholesale dumping.

40:49.163 --> 40:49.603
Could have been.

40:50.565 --> 40:50.965
Could have been.

40:51.005 --> 40:52.547
I mean, to call a spade a spade.

40:52.567 --> 40:53.969
Yeah, it could have been, frankly.

40:54.290 --> 40:56.072
This library didn't weed for years.

40:56.710 --> 41:03.377
They suffered from the fact that they moved from that building across the street over here without doing a systematic weeding program.

41:03.957 --> 41:07.521
And so then there was just all kinds of chaos, I understand.

41:07.541 --> 41:09.282
I don't know how true this is.

41:09.302 --> 41:10.744
These are just stories I've heard.

41:11.324 --> 41:11.725
Who knows?

41:11.785 --> 41:12.726
Panic, chaos.

41:13.166 --> 41:13.566
Who knows?

41:13.627 --> 41:25.418
But if you don't have a systematic weeding program so that you are evaluating the collection on a regular, systematic basis,

41:25.702 --> 41:28.185
And we've done all the work for it.

41:28.245 --> 41:30.028
We've got a collection maintenance program.

41:30.348 --> 41:31.670
We have a collection development.

41:32.871 --> 41:34.593
Staff has worked on these for years.

41:35.314 --> 41:41.022
But what they haven't done, and they always say they don't have time to do, is they don't have time to do the weeding.

41:42.043 --> 41:45.087
Just as you weed your garden, you've got to weed your collection.

41:46.268 --> 41:53.217
And I found that in Berkeley, if you didn't stay on people's backs about it, it didn't happen.

41:53.337 --> 41:54.679
It's not a lot of fun.

41:55.267 --> 41:57.590
It's the easiest thing to let slide.

41:57.610 --> 42:01.035
It's the easiest thing to let slide, and that is what happened here.

42:02.697 --> 42:05.841
And that's not the whole problem, but it contributes to it.

42:05.861 --> 42:20.762
It seems to me that there are probably about six or eight different factors, all of which in themselves are not huge, but by putting them together got the library to this issue where they said thousands of books were destroyed.

42:21.282 --> 42:22.143
Who the hell knows?

42:22.163 --> 42:22.624
I don't know.

42:22.992 --> 42:42.942
I know when you've got a catalog and you pull catalog cards, the way we were always taught in library school to pull catalog cards was, well, this one doesn't have a pocket, but, you know, you go to the catalog, you pull out the six or eight cards that go with it, you stick it in the pocket, you send the book away.

42:43.723 --> 42:44.925
There goes the record.

42:45.926 --> 42:51.615
Now, the only thing that the library might even have paid attention to, if they took the trouble to do it,

42:51.916 --> 42:53.398
would be the accession records.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.501
The accession records.

42:55.521 --> 43:06.817
Yeah, well, a lot of times if people kept accession records, if people kept shelf lists, that's what it's called, sometimes if you were really paying attention, you'd go in and you'd cross off the ones that had been discarded.

43:08.159 --> 43:09.621
I don't even know if that was done here.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.303
I don't know if there was a shelf list.

43:12.365 --> 43:19.054
In terms of those that were on the catalog, unless there was a last...

43:19.878 --> 43:22.602
You would not know, because there are no cards to pull.

43:22.622 --> 43:24.364
Or you'd know that there wasn't a copy anymore.

43:24.404 --> 43:25.385
You wouldn't know which.

43:26.146 --> 43:27.027
You know, it's wiped.

43:27.448 --> 43:28.709
It goes, it's erased.

43:29.170 --> 43:38.943
Do you have a sense of the feeling of a public library, a city public library, as being a repository as a research library?

43:38.963 --> 43:40.245
This isn't a research library.

43:42.548 --> 43:43.509
Even in any areas?

43:43.929 --> 43:45.491
Might be in San Francisco history.

43:46.232 --> 43:48.315
Might be a research library in art and music.

43:49.004 --> 43:50.486
But we are not a research library.

43:50.506 --> 43:53.309
There isn't a research library, I believe, west of the Mississippi.

43:54.890 --> 43:58.474
If you look at the criteria... In terms of a public library?

43:58.494 --> 43:59.535
In terms of a library.

44:00.456 --> 44:02.038
I think a library is a research library.

44:02.058 --> 44:04.260
Yes, it is, but it's... In terms of a research library?

44:04.280 --> 44:05.221
Not necessarily.

44:08.385 --> 44:11.228
There is no public library that's a research library.

44:12.429 --> 44:13.931
And San Francisco isn't one.

44:14.371 --> 44:16.193
And we don't have the money to become one.

44:16.612 --> 44:23.002
Because in order to become a research library, there's something called the Association of Research Libraries.

44:24.464 --> 44:30.754
And there are certain criteria they have for depth of collections and for the kinds of things that are kept.

44:30.854 --> 44:31.695
And we don't meet that.

44:32.897 --> 44:34.239
What's that about association?

44:34.519 --> 44:37.063
A-R-L, Association of Research Libraries.

44:38.866 --> 44:39.367
Why don't you?

44:39.407 --> 44:40.909
I think that would be useful for you.

44:42.131 --> 44:42.231
Yeah.

44:42.903 --> 44:45.766
Yes, in terms of San Francisco history, sure.

44:45.986 --> 44:48.268
We should have the best possible collection available.

44:48.769 --> 44:53.173
We should have an excellent collection of Californiana as well, and I think we do.

44:53.193 --> 44:57.817
We have some rare books, but we don't have a rare book library, per se.

44:58.638 --> 45:00.660
Nothing like what UC has, for instance.

45:02.202 --> 45:03.703
Or the New York Public Library.

45:03.843 --> 45:05.685
Or the Boston Public Library, right.

45:06.506 --> 45:07.447
Or Cleveland, or Chicago.

45:07.467 --> 45:07.767
Right.

45:08.328 --> 45:09.889
We are not that big a library.

45:10.561 --> 45:13.344
San Francisco isn't that big a city, if you think about it.

45:15.787 --> 45:19.330
We're a good reference library.

45:19.671 --> 45:20.572
That's the difference.

45:21.392 --> 45:32.004
We can probably answer 95% of the questions that somebody might come in to ask here, and answer that at some level of depth.

45:32.724 --> 45:38.070
But we would not be able to provide research materials to

45:40.362 --> 45:44.991
but we wouldn't be able to provide research material at the same level.

45:46.012 --> 45:58.415
In other words, we could answer your question, you know, who killed Cockwabin, but we wouldn't be able to give you the exhaustive material for the background of that particular question.

46:00.299 --> 46:03.585
We're probably the library, public library,

46:04.240 --> 46:10.828
Northern California, we're probably the strongest public library in Northern California in terms of collection size and breadth and depth.

46:13.211 --> 46:15.794
We're not as big as Los Angeles, you know.

46:16.755 --> 46:17.276
That's a much bigger city.

46:17.296 --> 46:17.936
Much bigger city.

46:17.956 --> 46:18.897
Have you visited that one?

46:19.578 --> 46:19.738
Not yet.

46:19.759 --> 46:20.459
You ought to go there.

46:21.441 --> 46:30.231
They did an extremely nice job in taking a 1927-29 building

46:30.768 --> 46:32.650
which was a landmark in adding on.

46:32.951 --> 46:34.353
They had a fire, too.

46:34.413 --> 46:35.494
Yeah, they had a terrible fire.

46:35.855 --> 46:37.757
But they were in worse shape than we were.

46:38.338 --> 46:40.000
Oh, they were in really very circus shape.

46:40.020 --> 46:41.582
Yeah, yeah.

46:41.662 --> 46:45.267
I'm going down in a couple of weeks to talk to the director.

46:45.467 --> 46:49.172
But, you know, they have more depth than we do.

46:51.635 --> 46:55.240
We are a popular, well, we are a number of things.

46:55.844 --> 46:58.568
In the branch libraries, we're a popular library.

46:58.608 --> 47:07.180
We're a reference library for high school students and for use by interested citizens.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.524
We're a library that serves a lot of children.

47:11.205 --> 47:15.371
You know, our Discovery Center here in this main library is a wonderful place.

47:16.292 --> 47:24.383
And it's particularly wonderful with the increase in population of children down here from, you know...

47:25.477 --> 47:31.366
Southeast Asia, yeah, because there's no place for these kids to go.

47:31.667 --> 47:33.489
We're a pretty good reference library here.

47:34.511 --> 47:37.496
We provide a lot of quick information, and we do a lot of programming.

47:38.477 --> 47:52.699
So we're kind of, I would say, pretty much middle-of-the-road urban library, with all of the urban library problems, all the problems that an urban library faces.

47:53.337 --> 48:03.369
So usage of material or non-usage is a criterion that probably might influence whether or not a book is kept.

48:03.389 --> 48:06.973
If a book hasn't been read, say, in two or three or four or five years.

48:07.353 --> 48:09.256
That would be a criteria, yeah.

48:10.137 --> 48:13.481
And for us also, in certain areas, the age of the material.

48:14.902 --> 48:16.304
You know, particularly in science.

48:17.866 --> 48:21.570
Why would we be wanting to have a book that says someday we will get to the moon?

48:22.812 --> 48:23.192
You know?

48:23.678 --> 48:27.482
It's not where we want to be necessarily.

48:27.503 --> 48:29.665
You're writing some social history, though, and you want to know what people thought about that.

48:29.685 --> 48:32.208
That's true, but then we can get that for you.

48:33.229 --> 48:37.554
We can interlibrary loan material from anywhere in the country, and we do.

48:38.596 --> 48:39.817
And that's the kind of material.

48:39.837 --> 48:46.064
There's a regional storage facility over in Richmond that the University of California has for its little-used material.

48:46.104 --> 48:49.228
We can borrow from them just like that, no problems.

48:50.069 --> 48:52.572
It takes a couple of weeks sometimes, but we can get it.

48:53.294 --> 49:11.881
What I find is that the major urban libraries, like the large supermarkets, have 80% of the use of the collection comes from 20% of the collection.

49:11.901 --> 49:19.652
And you'll find that in a large supermarket, 80% of their sales are 20% of the items that they stock.

49:19.732 --> 49:20.733
That's just the way it goes.

49:20.793 --> 49:22.035
The other 80%

49:22.285 --> 49:24.809
are there and are used a lot less.

49:25.309 --> 49:28.534
And that's where the decision to weed is so important.

49:29.035 --> 49:38.288
And that's why weeding a collection has to be done by people who know the collection, know the use patterns, and understand the community.

49:39.309 --> 49:44.937
And this, again, is something that you're insisting upon and hoping to implement even more?

49:45.158 --> 49:48.222
We're trying to train our staff on how we want to do this.

49:48.262 --> 49:49.744
We're doing a lot of staff training.

49:50.652 --> 49:59.844
My understanding also is that a lot of the subject areas were kind of like literature was folded into humanities and stuff like that.

49:59.864 --> 50:00.104
Yeah, yeah.

50:00.265 --> 50:01.727
I'm not sure how that works yet.

50:01.827 --> 50:04.210
I'm still—this is, as I said, my fifth week.

50:04.370 --> 50:07.294
Does that concern you at all, that kind of—?

50:07.454 --> 50:17.267
Well, one of the things— It has to do with how many service desks you want to staff.

50:17.753 --> 50:20.096
We have five floors.

50:20.116 --> 50:26.684
Well, we have six, actually, but I won't count the local history room up here as a service desk per se.

50:27.165 --> 50:38.739
But in terms of the five floors beneath us, periodicals on five, then we have government docs, and we have social sciences, and then we have general collections.

50:39.240 --> 50:42.644
A general reference on the third floor is the busiest of the desks.

50:43.465 --> 50:45.367
That also has the teenagers.

50:45.447 --> 50:47.490
That has a lot there.

50:47.825 --> 50:55.659
I'm not sure it necessarily dumbs down a collection because... Well, if it dilutes it... No, it doesn't dilute the collection.

50:55.679 --> 50:58.504
What it does is mean that you have fewer service points.

50:59.065 --> 51:02.070
Therefore, when you have fewer service points, you can staff them better.

51:02.911 --> 51:08.661
But you are requiring perhaps one person to be an expert in a lot of areas.

51:08.741 --> 51:10.204
We do that in the branch libraries too.

51:11.804 --> 51:14.987
But the branch is more of a satellite library.

51:15.007 --> 51:19.452
Yeah, this is the main library, and people learn how to do stuff.

51:19.472 --> 51:20.413
People are pretty smart.

51:20.493 --> 51:21.575
We've got pretty good staff.

51:22.275 --> 51:24.017
Oh, I'm very impressed.

51:24.298 --> 51:24.978
Well, you should be.

51:24.998 --> 51:25.819
They're pretty good people.

51:26.921 --> 51:30.004
But we have to broaden their knowledge bases sometimes.

51:31.225 --> 51:39.434
And we cannot have eight little service points with different staff assigned to those eight service points.

51:39.514 --> 51:41.136
We just don't have the staff to do it.

51:41.538 --> 51:44.782
Even at the optimum level of staffing, we don't have the staff.

51:45.183 --> 51:48.147
And we're not configured to do it.

51:48.167 --> 51:51.211
So I don't know what the percentage of use is of first stop.

51:52.032 --> 51:56.358
But from what I can see, it must be pretty heavy.

51:59.602 --> 52:00.644
Okay.

52:00.664 --> 52:04.489
If you've told me what your sense of your role is, I think.

52:05.570 --> 52:08.494
And you did say there were a lot of problems.

52:08.514 --> 52:10.397
You're hoping that...

52:10.698 --> 52:12.840
You said you've given yourself a year to get this thing?

52:13.281 --> 52:15.003
Well, I originally told him six months.

52:15.083 --> 52:16.405
I think it's going to take a year.

52:16.945 --> 52:18.207
I don't know how long it's going to take.

52:18.627 --> 52:22.952
It depends on how deeply I get involved with all this stuff.

52:23.873 --> 52:28.578
Weren't you considered for this job originally?

52:28.598 --> 52:29.219
Mm-hmm.

52:29.439 --> 52:32.683
Well, it's kind of ironic.

52:32.703 --> 52:40.452
Actually, what a friend of mine said to me, she said...

52:41.343 --> 52:46.091
It's kind of ironic that you're going in to clean up the mess you wouldn't have had if they'd hired you.

52:48.434 --> 52:50.558
And you're confident that that mess wouldn't have?

52:50.578 --> 52:51.259
I don't think so.

52:52.601 --> 52:53.362
I don't think so.

52:53.963 --> 52:58.690
If you look at my record and where I've been and what I've done.

52:58.710 --> 53:01.295
Your record totally speaks for itself, by the way.

53:01.355 --> 53:02.196
Thank you.

53:02.777 --> 53:09.207
You know, sometimes after a whole record of screwing things up, they do something really

53:10.064 --> 53:14.811
You see, nobody can complain.

53:15.432 --> 53:16.774
I'm just speaking now.

53:16.834 --> 53:19.158
No one has, as far as I know.

53:19.258 --> 53:21.341
I've covered the waterfront, so to speak.

53:24.566 --> 53:26.669
You're a book person.

53:26.689 --> 53:28.692
That's so important.

53:28.772 --> 53:33.579
And the perception of Mr. Dowling, I think, fairly or unfairly, is that... He isn't.

53:33.619 --> 53:34.440
He's not.

53:34.741 --> 53:35.883
No, he does read, though.

53:36.604 --> 53:38.907
He just doesn't consider himself a book person.

53:39.157 --> 53:52.495
I called the Chronicle book editor, whom I've known for a number of years, and I said, Pat, I left her an email message, actually, and I said, you know, I know you know I'm here.

53:52.595 --> 53:53.777
I'd like to review some books.

53:53.857 --> 53:58.423
I think it'd be nice to have this A Library and review books for the whatever.

53:58.483 --> 54:01.788
And she said, oh, that'd be great, but how about an interview?

54:01.808 --> 54:04.892
I saw her piece.

54:04.912 --> 54:05.933
Did you see this piece?

54:05.953 --> 54:06.134
Yeah.

54:06.214 --> 54:06.514
Yeah.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.425
And I just finished reviewing... In fact, I got it off the internet.

54:11.446 --> 54:12.206
How do you like that?

54:12.427 --> 54:13.208
Yeah, isn't that great?

54:13.608 --> 54:14.770
I just finished reviewing this.

54:15.430 --> 54:15.531
Ah.

54:16.271 --> 54:19.395
Which is, she said, I hope you don't mind commercial fiction.

54:19.455 --> 54:22.439
I said, how... Is this what you tell me, the book you reviewed?

54:22.459 --> 54:23.480
Rough Justice.

54:23.961 --> 54:25.663
It's kind of a little detail that I like.

54:25.743 --> 54:28.066
By Lisa... Scottolione.

54:28.086 --> 54:29.588
Scottolione.

54:29.608 --> 54:32.452
Scottolione.

54:32.472 --> 54:33.212
Rough Justice.

54:33.232 --> 54:34.875
Who publishes it?

54:35.435 --> 54:36.096
Mrs. Harper.

54:36.413 --> 54:37.475
Harper Collins.

54:41.180 --> 54:43.924
It's a female lawyer detective.

54:44.064 --> 54:45.186
Yeah, but you're a reader.

54:45.947 --> 54:46.207
Yeah.

54:46.367 --> 54:48.711
Well, hell, I take Bart to work when it works.

54:48.751 --> 54:50.633
These are the kinds of details I like.

54:50.674 --> 54:54.339
Yeah, I love, she said to me, I hope you don't mind commercial fiction.

54:54.359 --> 54:56.802
I said, Pat, I read commercial fiction.

54:56.822 --> 55:00.287
For me, it's what I read to relax.

55:00.648 --> 55:03.552
Yeah, this is what I read on the train every morning.

55:04.713 --> 55:06.235
How are you getting to work these days?

55:06.435 --> 55:07.597
I drove in this morning.

55:08.338 --> 55:10.181
Monday I took AC Transit.

55:10.201 --> 55:11.863
It took me two and a half hours to get here.

55:12.123 --> 55:15.087
I've been to Berkeley twice this week and had no problem.

55:15.268 --> 55:19.373
I mean, of course, I've gone over when everybody's coming this way and coming back at midday.

55:19.413 --> 55:20.314
I'm going back tomorrow.

55:20.334 --> 55:26.883
In fact, the gentleman from the gay lesbian, maybe that'll be Friday because I think tomorrow's a full day in Berkeley for me.

55:26.903 --> 55:28.806
You'll be around on Friday?

55:28.946 --> 55:29.807
Jim Van Beskirk?

55:29.908 --> 55:30.789
I think so.

55:31.830 --> 55:32.391
Let me...

55:33.822 --> 55:46.257
Just to go back briefly, you said you don't see this as a research library.

55:46.297 --> 56:02.597
However, to go to something that Mr. Coulter said, and he generated this, you know, when he visited libraries, he saw the Schomburg, which I write about in here, and he said, that's what I want.

56:03.505 --> 56:04.807
gay Schomburg.

56:06.529 --> 56:08.071
That's quite conceivable for us.

56:08.091 --> 56:10.253
Well, it's conceivable, but I said, you understand what you're saying.

56:10.273 --> 56:20.326
The Schomburg is undoubtedly the great African-American research collection of, you know, death.

56:21.047 --> 56:22.348
And we're not there.

56:22.448 --> 56:26.914
So when you're committing yourself, it's not enough to have subtitles that have been written

56:27.316 --> 56:32.107
by gay men and lesbians that, you know, that's not it.

56:32.507 --> 56:34.291
You have to have research materials.

56:34.311 --> 56:40.465
You have to have materials that will encourage a scholar to come from someplace in the world

56:40.732 --> 56:45.477
and to get material here that she or he can't get anyplace else.

56:45.758 --> 56:47.459
That's what the Gay Schomburg would be.

56:47.760 --> 56:53.026
That's right, and it would require significantly more room than we're able to give it at this moment.

56:53.046 --> 56:59.072
No, I think that affinity room, as pretty as it is, that's not about to house a major research.

56:59.332 --> 57:00.414
No.

57:00.434 --> 57:08.663
We do have, and Jim can show you these things, I was looking for his phone number and I realized this is before they opened here.

57:08.683 --> 57:10.705
Oh, I'll find it.

57:10.972 --> 57:14.137
But, you know, he's not in today, is that right?

57:14.298 --> 57:14.798
That's right.

57:14.879 --> 57:16.281
I know he'll be in tomorrow.

57:16.601 --> 57:18.184
Tomorrow will be the whole day.

57:18.264 --> 57:19.707
But maybe you could give him a call.

57:20.087 --> 57:20.829
Okay.

57:21.550 --> 57:22.371
Yeah, maybe I can.

57:22.712 --> 57:27.720
And I think we're coming to the end.

57:29.383 --> 57:32.188
I could talk to you all day.

57:32.208 --> 57:32.689
Let's see.

57:32.809 --> 57:33.570
Jim's.

57:38.005 --> 57:40.849
I'm really worried that this isn't an accurate number.

57:40.989 --> 57:44.213
I have 557... No, this is the right number.

57:44.233 --> 57:47.278
557... Okay.

57:48.800 --> 57:49.521
557... 4566.

57:49.541 --> 57:50.562
4566.

57:51.123 --> 57:56.290
That's Jim... Van Buscook.

57:56.310 --> 57:56.771
Okay.

57:56.791 --> 58:00.936
So to get back, however, to that, so you think that that is something that could happen?

58:01.898 --> 58:05.903
And of course, by saying that, then you also have to commit yourself to...

58:06.507 --> 58:07.688
committing funds.

58:07.708 --> 58:08.349
Absolutely.

58:08.709 --> 58:09.470
Absolutely.

58:09.490 --> 58:16.195
Like the Ginsberg collection, which would have been a wonderful archive here, but that went to Stanford and that cost them a million dollars.

58:16.215 --> 58:16.656
That's right.

58:17.997 --> 58:36.413
If we commit funds, I mean, what we're looking at here is that if we chose to become a research center in terms of gay and lesbian life and times and whatever, whether it's in the United States, whether it's in the West Coast, or whether it's gay and lesbian

58:36.511 --> 58:37.772
the whole thing.

58:38.413 --> 58:48.023
I think we would have to look very carefully at outside funding, at private funding, at an endowment, that kind of thing.

58:48.043 --> 58:50.446
It wouldn't be the first and it won't be the last either.

58:51.267 --> 58:54.230
We'd also have to look at how we were going to store this.

58:54.911 --> 59:06.163
I think one of the things that Ken had in mind was a lot of digitizing so that things could be accessible and stored, etc.,

59:06.346 --> 59:15.723
Well, there are copyright issues in digitizing material and fair use, and that hasn't even been looked at yet.

59:15.863 --> 59:21.994
Which is another aspect of this book I'm writing, which is really the library of the future.

59:22.014 --> 59:27.665
I've spent two days at Cornell, for instance, leading the world of this.

59:27.685 --> 59:28.506
And they're doing it.

59:28.790 --> 59:31.674
You have to get permissions.

59:31.694 --> 59:32.676
But they're sitting down.

59:32.716 --> 59:40.388
If they're looking at a book and it's going to be discarded, it's going to be digitized, or even if it's going to be disposed of, it goes through layers.

59:41.209 --> 59:44.875
This woman that's in charge of this, she wrote the regs on it.

59:44.895 --> 59:48.761
The committee, it's like, who's going to get the heart?

59:50.323 --> 59:51.846
They really apply it.

59:51.886 --> 59:53.248
That's the way it ought to be.

59:53.308 --> 59:55.371
They said, you can't keep every book.

59:55.486 --> 59:56.447
No, there's no way.

59:56.628 --> 59:57.248
Not even L.C.

59:57.529 --> 59:58.710
keeps everything they get.

59:58.831 --> 59:59.271
L.C.

59:59.351 --> 01:00:00.112
does not keep them.

01:00:00.132 --> 01:00:10.186
I'm going to see Diane Kresch down there in a couple weeks at their presentation unit, you know, and a lot of stuff doesn't make the cut.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:16.675
But yeah, you know, Paul LeClaire at the New York Public Library, you know, he's on the other side.

01:00:16.715 --> 01:00:18.658
He's almost done.
