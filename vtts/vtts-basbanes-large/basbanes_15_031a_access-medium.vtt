00:01.803 --> 00:04.146
We're talking to Norman Mailer.

00:04.166 --> 00:06.128
It certainly is an audacious book.

00:06.149 --> 00:07.170
Would you agree with that?

00:07.811 --> 00:14.779
Well, you know, I'm 74 now, and if you can't be audacious when you're old, then what's the sense of getting older?

00:15.600 --> 00:24.532
No, for young people, if I'd been 35 or 40, it would have been an immensely audacious book because it would affect the rest of my life.

00:25.894 --> 00:31.000
But I think as you get older, the risks seem less...

00:32.684 --> 00:36.308
overbearing than they once were.

00:36.708 --> 00:37.469
What were the risks?

00:37.669 --> 00:39.331
I mean, it seems like an obvious question.

00:39.351 --> 00:43.916
Well, ridicule, ridicule, playing the fool.

00:43.996 --> 00:48.221
You know, the sort of risks that writers face whenever they want to do.

00:48.842 --> 00:54.708
Whenever you want to do something ambitious in writing, you always have cautions.

00:56.050 --> 01:01.576
The cautions are, it better be good or the book reviewers are going to slaughter you.

01:01.596 --> 01:02.657
And that's not because

01:03.228 --> 01:11.776
You can even count on the reviews during any relation to what you've done.

01:11.816 --> 01:15.060
You know, you go out a bad book and get good reviews.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.301
Some writers do.

01:17.042 --> 01:18.583
You go out a good book and get bad reviews.

01:18.763 --> 01:19.544
So it isn't that.

01:19.564 --> 01:25.050
It's that you have to really have the feeling that what you've done was as good as you could make it.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.413
Just make sure you're going as we act.

01:28.433 --> 01:29.834
I'm paranoid about these things.

01:29.894 --> 01:32.577
Well, I get these out of the way, then you can see if it's moving or not.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.163
Just the red light is on, that's what it is.

01:36.645 --> 01:50.467
So, you know, you do try to work with, you do start a book with the knowledge that, and I've said this before, but one of the reasons I have, I'm so interested in fighters, is their lives are so different from writers.

01:50.567 --> 01:59.762
At the same time, there's one album that's similar, which is, particularly as you get older as a writer, what you recognize is, when you write a book, your life is easy.

02:00.923 --> 02:03.847
Well, I mean, you sit at a desk, you have hours on your own.

02:04.549 --> 02:08.515
Well, that part of the road, the working conditions can hardly be improved on.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.621
But when the book comes out, you take punishment.

02:14.644 --> 02:25.460
And it's equal to almost being a club fighter who knows that they're fighting a purse, the purse is going to take care of their families, their kids, their list of that, but they're going to take punishment.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.944
Their body's going to be less good when they're done than when they start.

02:28.845 --> 02:29.867
And so in that sense,

02:30.235 --> 02:37.442
When you get that attitude about reviews that, well, this is part of the punishment I want to take, it makes life a little easier.

02:38.843 --> 02:40.344
You just say, well, is the book worth it?

02:41.585 --> 02:44.348
And are you going to like the book as well as you can write it?

02:44.408 --> 02:53.136
Because the only defense against the review that you think is unfair is to feel that the fault is on the side of the reviewer.

02:54.217 --> 02:59.922
When a reviewer gets through to you, you're exactly like a doctor who's getting hit and hurt and, you know, being the loser.

03:00.188 --> 03:02.211
Did you watch the fight Saturday night, by the way?

03:02.491 --> 03:02.611
Yeah.

03:02.631 --> 03:03.352
It was a good fight.

03:03.372 --> 03:04.013
Very good fight.

03:04.114 --> 03:04.875
I was shocked.

03:04.895 --> 03:05.976
It was so good.

03:05.996 --> 03:08.740
No, and Foreman didn't look at all at home.

03:08.860 --> 03:10.122
He looked remarkable.

03:10.362 --> 03:11.704
But that was a tough guy.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.467
It was a tough guy, and he took a punch.

03:13.907 --> 03:14.648
Oh, yeah.

03:14.668 --> 03:16.972
Anyway, I don't mean golf and boxing, but you brought it up.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.156
No, no, they were taking some very tough punches.

03:20.657 --> 03:24.002
And he took quite a few from Foreman.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.064
Well, I love Foreman's interview, actually.

03:26.085 --> 03:27.386
He said, this guy was good.

03:27.406 --> 03:27.867
He said,

03:28.133 --> 03:29.875
I don't want any more fights like this.

03:29.935 --> 03:31.037
It's supposed to go down.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.879
I didn't hear what he said afterwards.

03:32.919 --> 03:34.100
Well, it was basically that.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.003
He said, I don't want any more fights like this.

03:36.143 --> 03:37.204
He said, I want to box.

03:37.224 --> 03:38.526
I want to put this guy away.

03:38.546 --> 03:42.150
And he said he took a couple of very good punches, and he wasn't going down.

03:42.170 --> 03:43.092
And he said he hurt him.

03:43.212 --> 03:44.473
The foreman said he hurt me.

03:44.493 --> 03:46.195
Yeah, the foreman was very honest after the fight.

03:46.776 --> 03:48.939
He really improved the manners of the fight game.

03:48.959 --> 03:49.460
I think so.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.142
He's such a wonderful example.

03:51.162 --> 03:51.883
Yeah, he does.

03:52.043 --> 03:52.644
He does.

03:52.804 --> 03:53.885
Everybody likes him.

03:53.905 --> 03:57.870
Women like him, you know, which is not boxing people like him.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.820
There's a great novel in Foreman.

04:01.020 --> 04:10.772
I'm not the one who's going to write it, but there is a great novel there because, you know, I saw a fair amount of them in Zaire.

04:10.832 --> 04:13.575
Not personally, because no one could get near them personally.

04:13.776 --> 04:17.120
But I was there, and I wrote a book about that.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.781
Of course, of course.

04:18.942 --> 04:22.366
I didn't realize that momentarily that was the fight.

04:22.806 --> 04:24.008
Yeah, the one in Zaire.

04:24.468 --> 04:26.811
But he was a man who...

04:27.668 --> 04:30.470
And what you can feel coming off of him is this enormous pride.

04:31.692 --> 04:37.517
So when he lost to Ali, it was a disaster for his ego, an absolute catastrophe.

04:38.477 --> 04:43.122
And it took him years to begin to put himself together afterwards.

04:43.142 --> 04:47.605
So the comeback from that and the change in personality is exceptional.

04:47.686 --> 04:48.346
It's incredible.

04:48.726 --> 04:56.173
I can't think of any other public figure in all these years who's had such a change of personality within a period of five to eight years.

04:56.423 --> 05:01.069
Why a novel and not a biography?

05:01.089 --> 05:04.433
And that actually gets us back to this book, too, I think.

05:04.533 --> 05:09.339
You've obviously affected me a month.

05:09.479 --> 05:10.861
I don't mean to do that.

05:11.842 --> 05:14.305
I don't know, just my instinct says that.

05:14.565 --> 05:24.237
A biography would be tough to do because you're not going to get people whose habit is to tell you the truth.

05:25.972 --> 05:27.694
with a boxing-consistent deception.

05:29.736 --> 05:33.979
You're not going to get people around a movie star to tell you what the movie star is really about.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.983
They're concealing what he or she is really about, because they have to.

05:38.284 --> 05:39.505
Their job is to conceal.

05:40.686 --> 05:53.818
When I did that biography on Marilyn Monroe, one of the things I realized at a certain point was my own interpretation of what she was up to, because everything around her was either legend, myth, or calculated distortion.

05:54.659 --> 05:56.442
And Marilyn was as guilty of it as anyone.

05:57.463 --> 05:59.646
She didn't want people to know what she was really like.

05:59.686 --> 06:04.914
She wanted them to see, or she wanted them to be seen, which was very necessary for her.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.960
And the same thing is true with a fighter.

06:10.882 --> 06:12.785
Chigui Torres is one of my great friends.

06:13.887 --> 06:21.277
You know, Jose Torres, who was the light heavyweight champion for 80 years.

06:21.558 --> 06:23.721
And we've had a lot of talks about fighting.

06:24.140 --> 06:26.884
Didn't he kill a fighter in the ring?

06:27.104 --> 06:28.546
No, no, no.

06:28.887 --> 06:31.851
No, Griffith killed Benny Perrette.

06:31.951 --> 06:32.933
Benny Perrette.

06:33.033 --> 06:33.253
Yeah.

06:34.275 --> 06:38.581
No, Taurus, but Taurus, Taurus is very bright.

06:38.861 --> 06:41.565
And so we talk a lot about it.

06:41.605 --> 06:43.408
He's interested in writing.

06:43.428 --> 06:44.609
He writes rather good pieces.

06:45.170 --> 06:46.212
But he wants to write a novel.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.896
And I says, well, he's very hard for you to write a novel.

06:48.916 --> 06:50.157
Because you're used to lying.

06:51.079 --> 06:52.020
You're used to the sections.

06:53.148 --> 06:58.115
You are used to having the other fighters think that you're going to throw a left when you're ready to throw a right.

06:58.675 --> 07:09.570
Of course, this all takes place in microseconds, but the perception is absolutely as half the art of boxing once the players, the fighters, are equal in stamina and condition.

07:10.672 --> 07:14.357
So the habit of telling the truth is not natural to a fighter.

07:16.219 --> 07:17.000
It is to a rider.

07:17.121 --> 07:22.648
A good rider has got the feel of the happiest outcome of anything they attempt

07:23.101 --> 07:25.924
You sort of think closer to the truth.

07:25.944 --> 07:26.564
Get a little closer.

07:27.145 --> 07:27.786
I'm sorry, go ahead.

07:28.206 --> 07:28.506
Go ahead.

07:28.526 --> 07:30.388
Well, that's the great difference.

07:30.408 --> 07:37.695
So in that sense, the people who are around a fighter like Foreman are not going to be a great deal of help in discovering what George is really like.

07:38.336 --> 07:40.738
They're going to try and take you off the sink rather than on it.

07:40.958 --> 07:43.461
And build the legend as opposed to penetrating.

07:43.581 --> 07:43.821
Yes.

07:44.061 --> 07:46.424
And so with a novel, you've been penetrated if you know enough.

07:46.544 --> 07:47.164
I don't know enough.

07:47.685 --> 07:50.407
I think you'd have to be a black man to write that novel.

07:51.028 --> 07:52.129
Would you call him Foreman?

07:52.480 --> 07:54.543
Or would you just be a foreman-like character?

07:55.404 --> 08:00.791
That would depend on the particular literary conceit I was working with.

08:00.831 --> 08:02.774
Because it's pertinent, I think, to this book, too.

08:02.854 --> 08:09.423
No, you could write a novel and call him foreman, and then talk about the fact that you called foreman, that doesn't mean you got him.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.648
That it's another character who you were calling foreman.

08:13.128 --> 08:16.853
Well, it was, for instance, with the executioner song, when I called Gilmore, Gilmore.

08:17.795 --> 08:19.517
I mean, I could have called him...

08:20.054 --> 08:22.537
Harry Kilmore.

08:22.557 --> 08:24.580
Yeah, but that was a non-fiction novel.

08:24.700 --> 08:32.570
I mean, that was... Yeah, but what I'm going to... I could have written it as a novel, a key novel, and everybody said Harry Kilmore is Gary Gilmore, and so forth and so on.

08:33.230 --> 08:40.940
But my feeling was I wanted to dramatize the fact that you can be as careful as you wish with your facts.

08:41.801 --> 08:44.404
And we were much more careful than the average story on Gilmore.

08:44.424 --> 08:48.930
We really... Larry Schiller is very, very good at doing research, investigative reporting, and

08:49.501 --> 08:50.382
I worked with him.

08:50.543 --> 08:52.786
I learned a lot from him about the best day of reporting.

08:52.806 --> 09:00.357
But the point is that we knew as much about Gilmore as anyone alive, and I still knew I was writing fiction.

09:00.377 --> 09:02.420
I still knew I was writing fiction.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.043
Is that what you said?

09:04.063 --> 09:05.845
I still knew I was writing fiction.

09:05.865 --> 09:06.787
I'm sorry, is that what you said?

09:06.807 --> 09:06.967
Yeah.

09:07.287 --> 09:07.868
Yeah, okay.

09:07.888 --> 09:09.210
Just want to make sure I get there.

09:09.230 --> 09:13.136
No, no, I knew as much about him factually as anyone could possibly know.

09:13.156 --> 09:15.880
We interviewed something like 300 people before we were done.

09:16.180 --> 09:20.666
people in Utah were great to interview because they were essentially innocent.

09:21.167 --> 09:25.432
Most of them had never been interviewed before, and so it was an extraordinary experience for them to talk.

09:26.414 --> 09:33.644
In fact, Schiller would always question them for an hour about their own life, no matter how minor they were to the story.

09:34.244 --> 09:43.256
He'd have them talk for an hour about their own life before he'd ask the question, when did the name of Gary Gilmore first occur?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.900
When did you first hear the name of Gary Gilmore?

09:46.167 --> 09:50.954
And then they were so ready to talk about Gilmore and their relationship that it worked very, very well.

09:51.054 --> 09:52.395
Yet we had the time to do that.

09:53.697 --> 09:58.123
It wouldn't work with someone who's used to being interviewed.

09:58.143 --> 10:00.186
They're thinking, come on, let's get to the story.

10:00.206 --> 10:03.110
Okay, let's cut to it.

10:03.130 --> 10:04.272
But it did work that way.

10:04.812 --> 10:14.065
But all the same, the more I learned about him, the more I knew that I could only make an approximation of what he was probably like.

10:14.770 --> 10:16.592
And finally, it was fiction.

10:16.612 --> 10:17.973
I wanted to dramatize that fact.

10:18.374 --> 10:24.541
So were you faced with similar dilemmas here with Jesus?

10:24.561 --> 10:26.242
Well, it was no dilemma at all.

10:26.322 --> 10:31.208
It's an impossibility to have the conviction for one moment that you know who Jesus is.

10:31.888 --> 10:33.650
But, you know, I believe in this.

10:34.031 --> 10:36.914
It's an impossibility, but you interpret it anyway.

10:37.434 --> 10:40.778
Well, because certain impossibilities are much more comfortable than others.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.524
It's an odd remark, and I never made it before.

10:46.145 --> 10:57.221
But when you're writing, particularly if you've been writing novels as long as I have for as many years, there's certain books that appeal to you because you feel that everything in your instinct tells you that you can do something with this.

10:58.743 --> 11:06.314
And the older you get, the more often that instinct is correct because it has a lot of experience to be able to judge what can be done and not be done.

11:06.995 --> 11:09.499
And I remember when I read the New Testament,

11:10.576 --> 11:14.880
The feeling I had is I can write something, I can do something very interesting with this story.

11:16.201 --> 11:17.903
The story appealed to the agreement.

11:17.923 --> 11:19.565
This is a recent reading of the New Testament.

11:19.685 --> 11:24.089
I read it about two years ago for the first time in maybe, oh, probably since college.

11:24.269 --> 11:26.291
And with the idea that something like that?

11:26.371 --> 11:27.092
No, no, I just read it.

11:27.112 --> 11:28.073
I was curious about it.

11:28.613 --> 11:32.757
I read Pope John Paul's book that he did with a Vatican journalist.

11:33.678 --> 11:40.144
And I've been interested in Pope John Paul for a long time because back about, oh, back about ten years ago,

11:41.052 --> 11:43.336
He had an encyclical.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.879
Unfortunately, I can't remember the number.

11:45.880 --> 11:56.659
But in that encyclical, he spoke of the two superpowers who were dominating the third world countries.

11:56.679 --> 11:59.384
And one stood for greed and the other stood for oppression.

11:59.404 --> 12:01.187
This was, of course, still during the Cold War.

12:01.869 --> 12:04.393
And besides the third world, there was a fourth world of the homeless.

12:05.116 --> 12:06.738
It was a lot more typical.

12:07.159 --> 12:11.164
At the end of it, he said that it's necessary to protect the third and fourth world.

12:11.804 --> 12:13.867
Maybe the Vatican will have to sell its treasures.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.672
Yeah, nothing ever happened with this historical.

12:17.732 --> 12:18.833
Nothing.

12:18.853 --> 12:20.836
At the time, it was a revolutionary document.

12:20.896 --> 12:23.659
You know, post-selling the treasures of the Vatican?

12:23.939 --> 12:26.803
Well, I mean, you know, I think what it was was

12:27.290 --> 12:30.934
is their feeling is let him say what he wants to say and we'll do what he wants to do.

12:30.974 --> 12:35.718
I'm working on a book myself where I'm going to be spending some time at the Vatican Library.

12:36.139 --> 12:37.860
I hope my memory is right.

12:37.940 --> 12:43.486
I don't know why, I think it was the sixth encyclical.

12:44.327 --> 12:46.629
But I can give you the year approximately.

12:47.290 --> 12:48.231
It was in the late 80s.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.815
And I think it was the only encyclical he wrote in that period.

12:53.236 --> 12:54.957
Late 80s, this is Pope John Paul II.

12:54.997 --> 12:55.778
Yes, yes.

12:56.872 --> 12:57.453
Okay, good.

12:58.534 --> 12:59.014
Okay, great.

12:59.035 --> 13:01.377
I'm sorry.

13:01.397 --> 13:03.980
And, no, it's well, it's beautifully written.

13:05.182 --> 13:07.204
And I remember at the time I was so impressed with it.

13:07.885 --> 13:11.709
I'm not, I mean, I'm not only Jewish, but I'm not in any way Catholic.

13:11.849 --> 13:15.654
I find the Church fascinating to me, but I'm, you know, I'm not a Catholic.

13:15.674 --> 13:18.357
And it was certainly something to look at.

13:18.377 --> 13:23.503
Yes, yeah, well, something to enter, you know.

13:23.838 --> 13:35.397
To go into a fine Catholic church is one of the more agreeable aids to meditation, to put it that way.

13:35.417 --> 13:36.479
Well, I'm Greek, you know.

13:36.559 --> 13:42.268
Our Easter was— So you're an Eastern— Yeah, plus I'm reading this for our Easter over the weekend.

13:42.328 --> 13:45.373
That's got to be something I have to say.

13:45.708 --> 13:49.373
And I know, you know, but it's great theater when you go to a Greek church.

13:49.493 --> 13:50.234
Oh, yeah.

13:50.374 --> 13:51.375
I've been at a Greek wedding.

13:51.495 --> 13:53.198
It really is quite remarkable.

13:53.218 --> 13:54.179
I've been at a Greek wedding.

13:54.279 --> 13:56.762
It went on for a long time.

13:56.782 --> 14:04.933
But as you put it, it really is not a Catholic experience, but it certainly is a very dramatic experience.

14:04.993 --> 14:05.093
Yeah.

14:05.113 --> 14:05.313
Oh, yeah.

14:06.054 --> 14:06.414
I'm sorry.

14:06.695 --> 14:12.783
No, I've been in Russia and seen the reaction of the Eastern church there.

14:12.803 --> 14:13.363
It's something.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.685
Very, very interesting.

14:15.037 --> 14:20.843
But in any event, I brought it up at Penn, and I said, maybe we can make him an honorary member.

14:21.844 --> 14:24.086
God, did I outrage the people at Penn.

14:24.226 --> 14:24.567
Really?

14:24.607 --> 14:25.928
You know, the literary organization.

14:25.948 --> 14:26.849
Yeah, no, I'm a member.

14:27.710 --> 14:28.811
Well, no, they were curious.

14:28.831 --> 14:31.093
This was at the executive board meeting.

14:31.634 --> 14:32.375
Why am I curious?

14:32.395 --> 14:33.015
He's a writer.

14:33.055 --> 14:34.136
That should be the only criteria.

14:34.156 --> 14:37.300
Well, you had a lot of women there who felt that the Pope was the enemy.

14:37.340 --> 14:40.122
You know, he's opposed to abortion, and so forth, and so forth.

14:40.623 --> 14:43.626
They didn't want to hear that he had a social point of view that was

14:43.994 --> 14:45.536
possibly to the left of their own.

14:46.357 --> 14:51.624
I mean, they're moving toward a cooperation, and he's moving toward egalitarianism.

14:53.206 --> 15:08.046
But at any rate, that contradiction fascinated me, and so I read his book some years later, maybe six, eight years later, I read the book, and he was so taken with the Gospel of John that I picked that up and read it.

15:08.066 --> 15:08.567
It wasn't

15:09.222 --> 15:11.084
I thought, no, I'll read all four.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.566
That's going backwards, isn't it?

15:12.586 --> 15:13.568
Well, that's the last.

15:13.748 --> 15:15.951
I'll read all four Gospels.

15:16.752 --> 15:17.112
And dear.

15:17.933 --> 15:19.916
At that point, I thought, there's a book here somewhere.

15:21.898 --> 15:23.240
This story ought to be retold.

15:25.563 --> 15:27.185
And so that's how it began.

15:28.807 --> 15:33.473
But you didn't go into this intending to give us any revelations, so to speak.

15:33.654 --> 15:33.854
No.

15:34.495 --> 15:35.376
No surprises.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.520
No, I have a point of view, a religious point of view, and I have

15:38.872 --> 15:43.819
Believe in God for 40 years, but the facts pretty much are in the way they have been.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.563
Well, what happens is I wrote it.

15:48.885 --> 15:57.477
And then after I'd written a solid first draft, well, if I saw it, I mean, I knew the book was there, and now it was a matter of working on it, working on it, working on it.

15:57.957 --> 16:02.143
But essentially, I didn't have to wonder whether I could write the book now the book was written.

16:02.163 --> 16:04.626
It's a question of what the style finally would be.

16:05.146 --> 16:08.269
I took it through many other things to get the stars where I wanted it.

16:08.489 --> 16:19.499
But I thought, I really am, I can't pretend that my knowledge on this subject is immense.

16:19.519 --> 16:20.880
Quite the contrary.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.481
So I started reading some of the scholars.

16:22.501 --> 16:34.292
I read Fidel and John Dominic Croissant and Funk and John Meyer who wrote

16:34.998 --> 16:36.700
He was written about the historical Jesus.

16:37.722 --> 16:40.305
And I read some of the Apocrypha and the other Gospels.

16:40.325 --> 16:44.851
And the more I read, the more I realized that it was perfectly safe to do what I was doing.

16:44.891 --> 16:50.038
Because no hard knowledge existed of what really might have happened at that time.

16:50.699 --> 16:53.042
There's no agreement whether it happened or didn't happen.

16:53.402 --> 16:55.124
If it did happen, how did it happen?

16:55.425 --> 16:57.888
There are as many variant versions as there are.

16:57.928 --> 17:00.111
Right, in the four Gospels, as he put up.

17:00.277 --> 17:01.879
differ themselves.

17:02.180 --> 17:04.863
Well, they differ immensely, and they differ within themselves.

17:04.963 --> 17:07.647
Obviously, the first three were written by committees.

17:08.729 --> 17:15.738
You know, and I've made this remark before, but it's a little bit like an Arab Israeli document.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.725
That is, since they can't resolve the differences, they put the differences into it.

17:21.827 --> 17:24.310
You see, at least they have a document, even though the differences are there.

17:25.031 --> 17:29.457
Let those people who like one side of the issue take that, and those who like the other take that.

17:29.943 --> 17:34.307
be true to your family, that deserts your family, and so forth and so on.

17:34.327 --> 17:41.054
So at any rate, what I thought was all right, what I'm doing is legitimate.

17:42.495 --> 17:57.570
I could spend the rest of my life studying these matters, and I would know a great deal more about many details and aspects and fascinating excursions from the topic, but I wouldn't know any more about the reality

17:58.023 --> 18:08.914
of Jesus, and what I started with was that the story is the keel, certainly for the last five centuries, has been the keel of Western civilization.

18:10.296 --> 18:13.619
People have grown up around the New Testament in the Western world.

18:13.679 --> 18:15.481
The greatest story that's ever told.

18:15.501 --> 18:15.581
Yes.

18:16.823 --> 18:18.064
And it's a pretty damn good story.

18:18.104 --> 18:19.986
It's a very good story.

18:20.046 --> 18:27.574
In fact, if Putin and Ursula hadn't written that book, and the title would ever occur to me, I might have dared to use the title.

18:27.655 --> 18:30.618
It's a wonderful title, and I wish I had it.

18:30.918 --> 18:32.500
Well, yours is pretty good, too.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.102
Mine was pretty good, but that's a wonderful title.

18:34.122 --> 18:43.932
The greatest story ever told, because it lays down the gauntlet.

18:46.394 --> 18:52.441
At any rate, the fact that it was an impossibility to come up with a real story didn't bother me a bit.

18:53.262 --> 18:53.962
That's the given.

18:54.042 --> 18:55.424
You're not going to come up with a real story.

18:55.524 --> 18:56.565
What you can come up with

18:57.203 --> 19:00.666
is a retelling of the psychological reality of the Western world.

19:01.387 --> 19:11.916
That is that story that exists as the keel of narratives of comprehension, of religious comprehension in the West.

19:14.419 --> 19:26.029
You know, you can't think of the Western world without, I think, nine out of ten people would agree that the keel, the foundation of Western thought, is built

19:26.515 --> 19:28.998
on the New Testament.

19:31.161 --> 19:45.079
And so I thought it's legitimate to, since I'm not trying to deal with the rise of a church, or I'm not dealing with anything but the story, it's legitimate to write about it in innocence.

19:45.099 --> 19:46.220
But it's still being narrated.

19:46.360 --> 19:51.527
That's still where the audacity comes from, is that it's the first person

19:52.064 --> 19:57.239
No, but I've written so many books where I've known a lot about the subject.

19:57.259 --> 20:00.268
Some of my factors will say too much about the subject.

20:00.288 --> 20:04.019
I've written books that took me, one book took 11 years, another took 7 years.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.225
I've done immense research on certain books.

20:09.361 --> 20:11.683
This one comes out of a certain essence.

20:11.704 --> 20:12.244
Yeah.

20:12.264 --> 20:17.970
In other words, sometimes if you don't know too much about a subject, you can do an awful lot with it because you have a fresh eye.

20:18.591 --> 20:20.052
It's absolutely true in movies.

20:20.112 --> 20:25.618
There are very many movie directors, foreign movie directors, who come over to America and make a sophisticated comedy.

20:26.760 --> 20:32.125
Let's say I'll make up, I don't know that any foreign director ever worked with Captain Hepburn.

20:33.487 --> 20:36.550
Well, I remember with...

20:37.357 --> 20:41.684
Greta Garber was made about Russian communists.

20:42.124 --> 20:43.106
It was made out of innocence.

20:43.126 --> 20:44.127
It was a wonderful movie.

20:45.289 --> 20:45.890
You can do that.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.232
You can do that in a novel, rather.

20:47.533 --> 20:49.976
You can work out of innocence.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.522
It's a choice.

20:54.203 --> 21:05.220
If I decided, no, I don't want to, I don't dare to write this book that way, I would have spent the rest of my life writing it.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.048
You know, for instance, I've got to finish the second volume of Harlan's Ghost.

21:10.189 --> 21:11.990
I hope I will finish it before I'm gone.

21:12.190 --> 21:14.393
And that's going to take five years probably.

21:14.993 --> 21:17.095
And that book will not be written in innocence.

21:17.115 --> 21:21.019
That book will be written as a great deal of research.

21:21.199 --> 21:22.400
How about getting the voice right?

21:23.081 --> 21:26.063
Getting the voice of the character here right there.

21:26.184 --> 21:27.605
Well, that was where the work was in this.

21:28.145 --> 21:29.427
It was just a matter of taste.

21:30.428 --> 21:36.253
And I started with a much more biblical version and began to realize that the language

21:36.908 --> 21:38.490
It wasn't working.

21:38.770 --> 21:41.394
The two arcane, two articles perhaps.

21:41.834 --> 21:41.894
No.

21:41.974 --> 21:48.703
Thus it was that I came to the hour, you know, that sort of writing.

21:49.304 --> 21:51.506
And I thought, no, it's not going to work in the first person.

21:51.526 --> 21:52.187
It's going to be simpler.

21:52.207 --> 21:53.108
It's going to be more direct.

21:54.070 --> 21:54.851
And I worked on that.

21:55.351 --> 21:56.092
That goes humor.

21:56.152 --> 21:59.997
I mean, you're talking about calling it a little miracle.

22:02.390 --> 22:04.172
How is this getting to this page?

22:04.433 --> 22:05.714
Well, call it a miracle.

22:05.734 --> 22:08.798
I can do these things.

22:08.818 --> 22:11.943
You know, there are little touches of humor in there.

22:12.203 --> 22:15.387
You have to watch yourself, I think.

22:15.407 --> 22:30.507
Well, you see, the interesting aesthetic problem was one of the strong parts of it, one of my given that's good to begin with, given this wonderful story, I don't have to worry about a plot.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.988
I can't tell you what an immense load that is.

22:34.709 --> 22:40.517
You have to wait with the client to lift 300 pounds, and 150 is taken off the barbell.

22:40.858 --> 22:43.321
The audience with 150, that's very good for him.

22:43.341 --> 22:49.270
If it still looks like 300 pounds to others, that's a huge advantage.

22:50.271 --> 22:56.800
The disadvantage was that the style was going to take forever to get right.

22:57.781 --> 23:00.325
I mean, I wrote the first draft in a few months.

23:00.676 --> 23:03.419
And then it took me probably a good part of the next two years.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.000
Really?

23:04.361 --> 23:06.423
Well, I wasn't working only on that.

23:06.523 --> 23:09.327
I'd do other things and come back to it, do other things and come back to it.

23:09.807 --> 23:14.954
And each time I come back to it, I thought of a, you know, a clearer notion of what the style should be.

23:16.035 --> 23:23.384
Because I wanted a style that was neither modern nor back as far as the King James Version, but would have echoes of it.

23:24.306 --> 23:25.167
And it was readable.

23:26.829 --> 23:30.193
It was not too knotted up in archaism.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.696
At the same time, it was not too modern.

23:32.736 --> 23:35.560
I didn't want a dumbed-down version of the novel.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.882
But it's relevant, though.

23:36.942 --> 23:38.524
The relevance is there, isn't it?

23:38.604 --> 23:39.886
We're talking about the Holocaust.

23:39.946 --> 23:42.289
We're talking about greed and money.

23:42.690 --> 23:45.854
Well, that was what overtained me as I was doing.

23:45.874 --> 23:50.640
I think every month that goes by, this book is becoming more relevant to modern times.

23:50.740 --> 23:51.542
Amazing, isn't it?

23:51.702 --> 24:00.113
Yeah, that part just... And then you see this Hale-Bopp thing, you know, with this New Age blather that these people, you know, the two...

24:00.481 --> 24:03.627
These 39 people that committed suicide to get on the comet.

24:03.807 --> 24:04.369
Yeah, yeah.

24:04.389 --> 24:08.477
And you almost see this, they're almost mouthing things out of the New Testament.

24:08.497 --> 24:09.639
I know, it's a good show.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.861
It's amazing.

24:10.881 --> 24:13.065
Did you see the New York Times story on that today?

24:13.106 --> 24:14.809
No, I saw the headline.

24:14.849 --> 24:17.755
The details on it, huh?

24:17.795 --> 24:19.338
It's unbelievable.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.640
It's almost like a novella.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.622
I mean, it's in length.

24:21.983 --> 24:22.624
It's magnificent.

24:23.212 --> 24:28.217
Yeah, no, that's beyond my imaginative reach, that story, I have to say.

24:28.517 --> 24:29.458
I wouldn't tackle that one.

24:29.558 --> 24:36.065
But imagine you get almost to the end of the millennium, and a comet comes by, and that signals 39 people to let them kill themselves.

24:36.205 --> 24:37.386
No, no, it's amazing.

24:38.167 --> 24:40.710
Well, we're living in amazing times, because everything is out of whack.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.312
Everything is out of whack.

24:43.333 --> 24:50.860
And I think the novel takes advantage of that, and I don't mean to take advantage of that, but you use that as a premise, don't you?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.662
Well, you know, I never liked to write

24:53.266 --> 24:57.992
When I wrote Ancient Evenings, I was not interested in being contemporary for one minute.

24:59.074 --> 25:07.545
In fact, there was one distinguished critic, who shall be nameless, who got the book all wrong, because they said this was Mayer's version of modern America.

25:08.106 --> 25:08.987
It was Ancient Evenings.

25:09.027 --> 25:09.648
It wasn't at all.

25:10.148 --> 25:13.693
I was trying to go as far away from America and the Western world as I possibly could.

25:14.094 --> 25:19.881
I wanted to capture for myself, at any rate, what Ancient Evenings were like.

25:21.463 --> 25:22.024
And...

25:24.451 --> 25:27.495
So it wasn't that I was looking for parallels at all.

25:27.716 --> 25:31.441
In fact, I did my best to remove obvious parallels whenever I found them.

25:32.082 --> 25:38.150
I didn't want the anachronisms of that sort in there, because they can become anachronisms all too easily if you're forcing the material.

25:38.911 --> 25:40.714
But here it was different.

25:42.917 --> 25:53.091
I began to realize that there's a mighty moral message in the words of Jesus Christ, which is, there he is, the first social democrat.

25:54.539 --> 25:55.740
along with everything else.

25:55.780 --> 26:05.970
I mean, that obviously is not what he was up to, but when you have that confrontation between Judas and Jesus, there's the radical talking to the social democrat effect.

26:05.990 --> 26:21.125
I'll tell you, the way you, how often we, as Christians, you know, you go to Sunday school, of course I haven't gone to church in years, but you know the story of the crucifixion, but I mean, you really do give the sense of pain there.

26:21.145 --> 26:24.208
I have to say that sense of when he's nailed to the cross,

26:25.133 --> 26:27.956
pain that he must have experienced.

26:28.176 --> 26:28.457
Yeah.

26:28.577 --> 26:31.900
And you did a magnificent novelist job, I thought.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.203
Did you work hard on scenes like that?

26:34.243 --> 26:39.748
I mean, you're assuming what the pain must have been like to a human, but yet this is the Son of God, too.

26:39.889 --> 26:40.269
Yeah.

26:40.489 --> 26:41.470
No, it's very simple.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.432
You say, what would I feel like?

26:43.552 --> 26:43.813
Yeah.

26:44.413 --> 26:48.978
Because, you know, I was dealing with him as a man rather than as a divinity.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.681
I was wise enough to know that my

26:52.049 --> 26:54.892
powers to divine the nature of divinity are limited.

26:56.053 --> 27:06.043
But I did think, well, as a man, his experience appealed to me very much because I've always been fascinated with worthy protagonists.

27:07.284 --> 27:09.046
He was this extraordinary protagonist.

27:09.126 --> 27:11.669
As a man, he's an extraordinary protagonist.

27:11.689 --> 27:17.975
And on top of that, there's that very artful difficulty of writing about someone who's nicer than yourself.

27:18.956 --> 27:21.178
Very hard to do.

27:23.555 --> 27:28.602
What is it about people who are larger than life, though, for you?

27:28.662 --> 27:31.166
You seem to be drawn to them in your writing over the years.

27:31.927 --> 27:38.155
Well, you know, I've had this life that by now is my life, and I'm used to it, and I'm comfortable within it.

27:38.216 --> 27:43.944
As you do tend to be comfortable as you get older, you know, whatever happened to you, it's your life.

27:44.064 --> 27:47.649
And at the age of 74, you know you're not going to have another kind of life.

27:48.149 --> 27:50.693
It seems to me that all through the early years and the middle years,

27:50.960 --> 27:53.603
was always thinking, should I have this life or should I have that life?

27:53.643 --> 27:59.929
But you get, I suppose what they mean by getting old, wise, and mellow, but finally you realize, well, this is the life I've had.

27:59.989 --> 28:00.910
I'm not going to have another one.

28:01.571 --> 28:13.703
And so looking upon it now, what I realize is that I've had a very odd life because from the age of 25 on, I was a celebrity, whether I wanted to be or not.

28:14.324 --> 28:16.346
And for the first 10 years, I didn't want to be at all.

28:16.406 --> 28:18.829
It created a huge disruption in my life.

28:18.889 --> 28:20.190
I wanted my life to develop

28:20.440 --> 28:30.013
comfortably and normally, and instead I had all sorts of power with people that I didn't feel I'd earned, and vice versa.

28:30.073 --> 28:35.181
People had all sorts of ideas about me that they'd gotten from the media that were very often inaccurate.

28:36.422 --> 28:38.545
And so I used to grouse all the time about it.

28:38.826 --> 28:45.875
You know, this is unfair, this is awful, and of course being secretly pleased with the power and all that.

28:46.456 --> 28:48.439
Well, that...

28:50.123 --> 28:59.794
What I realized at a certain point is I understand people who've had exceptional lives better than I understand people who've had relatively normal lives.

28:59.854 --> 29:08.004
And it wasn't for me to write wonderful, modest novels about essentially where genre.

29:10.086 --> 29:13.430
You know, I couldn't do the sort of thing where, let's say, Van Tyler does.

29:14.211 --> 29:15.292
And does very, very well.

29:16.453 --> 29:18.496
Because it wasn't my life.

29:18.856 --> 29:19.557
What my life...

29:19.908 --> 29:22.671
how to deal with is the questions of identity.

29:23.312 --> 29:26.215
And I suffered with questions of identity long before the word came along.

29:26.916 --> 29:30.280
When the word came along, I finally realized, yes, yes, that's my life.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.721
It's the life of a great many other people.

29:32.242 --> 29:40.451
And so I find it almost easier to write about movie stars and athletes and presidents and people like that, but about ordinary people.

29:40.932 --> 29:43.975
What I loved about the execution of songs was it gave me a chance

29:44.697 --> 29:48.742
to write about people who had lives that were not remarkable in the media.

29:49.443 --> 29:51.025
And Oswald as well, of course.

29:51.286 --> 29:57.634
Well, Oswald was different because that was both the man who's not at all in the media and the man who dominated the media.

29:59.316 --> 30:00.918
But after his death, though.

30:00.938 --> 30:01.279
What?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.100
But after his death.

30:02.120 --> 30:05.524
After his death, yes.

30:07.681 --> 30:11.946
Although, in a funny way, I think it was no surprise to him that he'd have an enormous impact on history.

30:11.966 --> 30:13.088
Oh, he was smiling, yeah.

30:13.108 --> 30:17.393
I think he thought he might have a more positive effect on history than he ended up with, but that's the end of there.

30:17.754 --> 30:19.836
Well, can you see him working the internet?

30:20.137 --> 30:22.640
He'd have a website today, wouldn't he?

30:22.780 --> 30:23.321
Oh, wouldn't he?

30:23.481 --> 30:23.821
Wouldn't he?

30:24.062 --> 30:25.624
I think he does anyway.

30:28.647 --> 30:29.088
He does.

30:30.209 --> 30:32.492
Fifty years, my God, the next, in 1998.

30:32.673 --> 30:36.237
Next year will be the 50th anniversary.

30:36.588 --> 30:41.813
Which means I've been a novelist for 50 years, because that's why I didn't write The Naked and the Dead in two minutes.

30:41.893 --> 30:44.295
Any thoughts on that?

30:44.435 --> 30:52.803
Well, I'm going to do a book, it'll be a large book, probably about 14, 15 hundred pages, which I think we'll probably call it The Best Parts.

30:53.643 --> 31:04.333
And I'll start with The Naked and the Dead, and just take excerpts from all my books, all my books that I think are worth it, and put into a huge book.

31:04.887 --> 31:07.250
Are you going to write anything original for this?

31:07.510 --> 31:07.971
A little bit.

31:08.131 --> 31:08.492
A little bit.

31:08.512 --> 31:09.052
Not a great deal.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.215
But I hope not.

31:11.335 --> 31:17.263
I don't want to spend more than a half year on the book.

31:17.283 --> 31:18.625
My publishers have agreed to do it.

31:19.286 --> 31:22.610
Next May, if I get it out, I'll get it too, but by September.

31:24.753 --> 31:26.515
But that shouldn't be too difficult.

31:26.535 --> 31:27.637
I sort of know what I want to put in.

31:29.099 --> 31:33.865
But it'll be a little bit like an artist's retrospective, a painter's retrospective.

31:34.942 --> 31:36.144
But do you reread your books?

31:37.125 --> 31:38.486
Well, I've been rereading them lately.

31:38.507 --> 31:39.928
It's interesting.

31:40.609 --> 31:45.876
I find the novels, actually, that I like them more than I thought I would.

31:46.737 --> 31:50.241
And the magazine pieces, some of them are not as good as I remember them.

31:51.062 --> 31:55.448
They have marvelous, from my point of view, marvelous little things in them, nuggets.

31:56.086 --> 31:59.390
But they don't read with a... Well, it was journalism in a way.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.812
Well, they're in and out.

32:00.952 --> 32:01.473
They're good.

32:01.633 --> 32:02.734
They're good for five pages.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.778
They're just routine for a few pages, and they get good again.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.242
They don't have the... Not too many of the shorter pieces have a real sweep.

32:09.823 --> 32:10.965
But they have very good nuggets.

32:11.265 --> 32:11.786
Nuggets.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.148
But how do you consider completed work, completed work?

32:14.169 --> 32:17.312
Would there be a temptation to tinker with some of this stuff as you look at it?

32:17.332 --> 32:18.414
Only in the smallest way.

32:18.454 --> 32:19.896
In the Harry James fashion?

32:19.916 --> 32:22.959
I'll cut out a few lines here or there, and I'll announce that to the reader.

32:23.660 --> 32:25.823
I mean, if something's going along very well...

32:26.140 --> 32:29.825
for three or four pages in the middle of the two or three sentences where I got off the tracks.

32:30.285 --> 32:31.527
I don't see any reason to honor it.

32:31.547 --> 32:33.349
This is not a mortal stuff.

32:33.369 --> 32:34.270
This is just good stuff.

32:35.512 --> 32:41.099
So you don't really have a problem, I hate these words, tinkering with them.

32:41.119 --> 32:45.585
Well, Engels once said quantity changes quality.

32:46.606 --> 32:49.469
I think a little tinkering is altogether different from serious tinkering.

32:50.571 --> 32:52.333
That is, I don't think you're violating...

32:53.680 --> 33:01.211
The small history that's involved, if you take out a few sentences here and there, I think there's an enormous difference if I start going in for major revisions.

33:02.472 --> 33:04.054
And then it would take two years if I did that.

33:04.715 --> 33:11.605
And this really doesn't have much to do with this piece, but I can use it for another context.

33:11.939 --> 33:16.103
Any thoughts on the printed book and the novel?

33:16.564 --> 33:19.908
You know, we've had all this talk about the future book and digitized books.

33:19.928 --> 33:20.588
Well, I'm gloomy.

33:20.789 --> 33:21.249
I'm gloomy.

33:21.790 --> 33:22.631
I really fear.

33:22.671 --> 33:22.971
You're what?

33:23.051 --> 33:23.431
Gloomy?

33:23.471 --> 33:23.992
Is that the word?

33:24.172 --> 33:24.873
Gloomy, yeah.

33:24.973 --> 33:25.614
Gloomy is the word.

33:25.954 --> 33:34.984
Because what I fear is that people are going to get used to reading things on the Internet and spend more and more time reading on the Internet.

33:35.044 --> 33:36.365
The Internet is much harder.

33:36.425 --> 33:38.908
The screen is much harder on the eyes on the book.

33:39.445 --> 33:44.029
So the net result of that will be really much less in years to come, number one.

33:44.049 --> 33:51.516
And there's something about the internet that I find sinister in relation to books.

33:53.759 --> 33:59.024
Something, I can't put my finger on it.

33:59.724 --> 34:00.865
I just don't feel good about it.

34:02.747 --> 34:05.790
And also I think people are much less interested in the novel than they used to be.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.567
I think the best novelists are the ones who are going to go first.

34:08.587 --> 34:10.429
I think we're going to be like poets in years to come.

34:10.509 --> 34:11.029
Really?

34:11.049 --> 34:17.517
Yeah, if you want to be a serious novelist, then that's your avocations, no longer your avocations.

34:17.537 --> 34:19.719
You'll need a subsidy to do it, so to speak.

34:19.820 --> 34:28.309
Yeah, but poets, you know, people will respect serious poets, and there's a minority of people for whom poetry is more important than anything.

34:28.329 --> 34:28.730
That's right.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.113
And it'll be true for a small group for novelists.

34:31.433 --> 34:34.056
Are you at all familiar with this...

34:34.458 --> 34:36.561
concept that they have this interactive fiction.

34:36.601 --> 34:39.765
At Brown University, for instance, they have a whole department.

34:39.785 --> 34:40.686
Of interactive fiction?

34:40.706 --> 34:46.895
Well, yeah, they write novels that you access through your computer, and you change it.

34:47.035 --> 34:48.737
I mean, it's not a completed work.

34:48.817 --> 34:53.063
It's not something that the writer, the novelist, has total control over.

34:53.103 --> 34:59.351
It can be changed by... I think they're getting ready for the literary wing on the spaceship.

34:59.371 --> 35:00.533
Jeez.

35:00.749 --> 35:03.633
But they have a course.

35:03.693 --> 35:08.299
They have a department at Brown called Interactive Fiction.

35:08.439 --> 35:13.145
Well, it would be useful for a great deal, but not for writing novels, no.

35:14.206 --> 35:17.210
I think a novel is so personal.

35:17.490 --> 35:23.538
It bears the same relation to serious writing that the orgy does to serious marriage.

35:25.601 --> 35:29.085
No one's going to say that the orgy is without merit for the people who enjoy it.

35:30.247 --> 35:30.748
you see.

35:31.629 --> 35:36.595
But I don't know that that has a hell of a lot to do with maintaining the strength of a marriage for most people.

35:37.156 --> 35:41.802
There will be occasional marriages that benefit from the orgy, but only occasional marriages.

35:41.882 --> 35:43.504
Most marriages will be destroyed by it.

35:44.085 --> 35:47.670
So you really are fearful for the future of the serious novel.

35:47.690 --> 35:58.684
Oh, I said, I feel that the serious novelist in 50 years is likely to be like the coachman in Central Park who takes you out for a ride with his old horse and his old carriage.

35:59.465 --> 35:59.545
Hmm.

36:00.031 --> 36:05.417
You know, it'll be a profession that'll be endearing, but that'll be like the best you can say.

36:05.878 --> 36:07.960
And the bestsellers will be written by computers.

36:09.302 --> 36:16.129
And there's a tendency, there's a real tendency in the world now to put everyone into the computer.

36:16.810 --> 36:24.098
You know, I've also said that part of them, that the women could do well to recognize that that revolution of theirs has accomplished many, many things for them.

36:24.819 --> 36:28.063
They've also been finally...

36:29.208 --> 36:30.209
Why was it welcomed?

36:30.309 --> 36:32.292
Why was it such a painless revolution for them?

36:32.712 --> 36:35.716
Why are they welcomed to a degree into the corporation?

36:36.297 --> 36:37.539
Why are they welcomed into sports?

36:37.579 --> 36:38.640
Why are they welcomed everything?

36:38.660 --> 36:39.922
Because it's easier for the computer.

36:40.442 --> 36:42.485
At the time, men and women become exactly the same.

36:43.806 --> 36:46.690
The computer won't have to deal with a binary system.

36:46.970 --> 36:55.041
They can deal with just one unit rather than two on everything, which will double the power of the computer in years to come.

36:55.061 --> 36:55.481
That's funny.

36:56.643 --> 36:56.903
That's funny.

36:57.895 --> 37:00.459
I don't want to bother you with questions about the novel.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.740
That speaks for itself.

37:02.101 --> 37:14.598
I did want to comment on the 50 years, because that really is quite a remarkable performance.

37:14.799 --> 37:18.043
What makes it agreeable for me is that I'll be 75 next year.

37:18.724 --> 37:22.229
And so 75 and 50 are sort of natural numbers.

37:22.249 --> 37:27.396
And you're two years before the year 2000, which is not insignificant to me.

37:27.562 --> 37:28.002
either.

37:29.284 --> 37:32.267
I mean, you're approaching the year 2000.

37:32.307 --> 37:36.112
You've got half of this, fully half of this century as a professional.

37:36.292 --> 37:38.514
I can get out of that book ahead of the bridge.

37:41.177 --> 37:44.261
What else did I want to, we've got a lot of stuff here.

37:44.301 --> 37:50.768
Have you had any reaction from the church, from priests?

37:50.888 --> 37:54.953
No, no, there was one, where did it appear?

37:55.996 --> 38:11.598
Oh, yes, there was a new story by Bruce Weber who approached the church and approached, I guess, someone who was high in the diocese in New York who said that the church had not come to a decision yet on their attitude toward the book.

38:14.142 --> 38:15.203
And that intrigued me.

38:15.689 --> 38:18.732
I would guess I'd like to think this is true.

38:19.152 --> 38:22.675
It could be that he just was stalling and they hadn't even talked about it.

38:22.695 --> 38:23.816
That's always a possibility.

38:24.276 --> 38:27.860
The other possibility is that they were saying, is this book good for us or bad for us?

38:27.900 --> 38:29.101
And there were people on each side.

38:30.062 --> 38:34.786
And it seemed to me that if I were high in the church, I'd have a tough time deciding.

38:34.966 --> 38:37.028
I mean, the book is sacrilegious in certain ways.

38:37.108 --> 38:41.271
On the other hand, it certainly does not sneer at the story.

38:42.092 --> 38:45.595
It may make the story available to people who would otherwise not come near it

38:46.216 --> 38:48.080
It's a hard call.

38:48.941 --> 38:52.308
Of course, you have Jesus confessing that adultery of the heart.

38:52.328 --> 38:56.155
He even suffers pangs of he can't look at the woman in the eyes.

38:56.195 --> 38:57.618
Well, I think in the New Testament he can't look.

38:57.799 --> 38:59.261
He drops his head and writes in his face.

38:59.281 --> 38:59.722
Is that right?

39:00.624 --> 39:02.367
But you're interpreting what he's feeling there.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.692
I'm interpreting what he's feeling, yes, that he can't look at the woman.

39:05.273 --> 39:05.794
Because he's

39:06.280 --> 39:07.522
He doesn't want to be stirred by him.

39:07.622 --> 39:09.304
He doesn't want to be stirred by him.

39:09.324 --> 39:11.887
Is that the meeting with the devil after 40 days?

39:11.907 --> 39:13.610
Is that in the Bible, too?

39:13.630 --> 39:14.811
Well, there's a meeting on the mountain.

39:15.472 --> 39:19.237
When he's alone on the mountain after 40 days of fasting, the devil does come.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.440
And does God tell him the devil's going to be here?

39:23.403 --> 39:25.045
You know, I honestly don't recall this moment.

39:25.265 --> 39:26.306
But that was very effective.

39:26.647 --> 39:31.814
Yeah, I think in effect he knows God.

39:32.795 --> 39:33.816
I wish I had a New Testament here.

39:33.836 --> 39:34.397
We could look it up.

39:34.477 --> 39:35.038
Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:35.187 --> 39:36.209
I'm not sure.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.251
I'm not sure at the moment.

39:37.291 --> 39:37.892
I don't recall.

39:38.112 --> 39:40.617
But that was the novelist's prerogative.

39:40.637 --> 39:43.762
If you listen to the New Testament, it was something I couldn't resist putting in.

39:45.285 --> 39:54.141
So when you had this done, and we're talking about the church, the, you know, where it isn't in yet, were you

39:54.627 --> 39:56.910
mindful while you're revising this thing.

39:56.950 --> 39:57.791
I'm going to take this out.

39:57.811 --> 40:00.635
This is going to piss a few people off.

40:01.616 --> 40:02.718
No, not like that.

40:02.778 --> 40:06.082
You know, I think probably the first version was more respectful than the last.

40:07.364 --> 40:09.727
It wasn't because what I realized was that I'm going to do this.

40:10.989 --> 40:14.333
The last thing I want to do is write a highly irreverent book that mocks it.

40:14.573 --> 40:15.414
That wasn't my interest.

40:15.494 --> 40:16.296
Anyone could do that.

40:16.316 --> 40:24.246
You know, the left for years has been so hostile to anything for good cause, which is

40:24.631 --> 40:32.501
We've had all those terrible years of the Cold War, which went on 20 years longer than it ever had to, with all that false propaganda.

40:32.981 --> 40:38.268
Soviet Union was an evil empire with the forces of Christianity fighting godless materialism.

40:39.449 --> 40:42.754
You know, Ronald Reagan squared, enshrined.

40:43.555 --> 40:47.560
And I couldn't have written this book 10 years ago because I would have felt as if I were working for Ronald Reagan.

40:49.162 --> 40:53.507
But now that the war is over, my feeling is there's a huge divide in the country between the left and

40:54.213 --> 40:57.157
There are many religious people on the left, but there are many more who are not.

40:57.758 --> 41:00.281
And there are many who hate the very notion of Christianity.

41:00.742 --> 41:07.631
And then you've got the far right that are devoted to Christianity and are not really economically greedy, like the corporation.

41:08.072 --> 41:16.203
You've got the Republican Party with its transcendent schizophrenia, the only schizophrenia that seems to work and keep a party alive.

41:16.263 --> 41:19.808
It's hard to believe, because you've got two halves of the party with nothing to do with each other.

41:20.529 --> 41:21.570
One half is...

41:21.922 --> 41:25.165
modest as economic demands and rooted in Christ.

41:26.146 --> 41:28.549
And the other half of it is totally schizophrenic.

41:28.789 --> 41:34.635
Not totally schizophrenic, totally, quite the contrary, totally oriented toward making fortunes.

41:35.796 --> 41:36.797
Greed is God.

41:36.897 --> 41:37.798
Greed is gold.

41:38.419 --> 41:39.240
Greed is good.

41:40.021 --> 41:49.110
And so, and in between that, Bill Clinton has managed to sail the huge ship of the Democratic Party into harbor between the two halves of the Republican Party.

41:49.428 --> 41:51.130
So my feeling is there's no answer.

41:51.150 --> 41:59.157
The corporation's going to get larger and larger and larger and suffuse every pore of American life with its dull power.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.521
But you don't make a political statement with this book, do you?

42:02.881 --> 42:10.829
No, but my point is that what I would be very happy to see is that the left and the right were able to have a dialogue with one another.

42:10.849 --> 42:16.154
And my feeling is this book could be one of the elements of such a dialogue because they can meet in the middle.

42:16.774 --> 42:18.456
Neither side is going to agree with it.

42:18.824 --> 42:21.549
But they at least could speak to one another after reading this book.

42:21.950 --> 42:24.033
Who do you think is the reader of this book?

42:24.234 --> 42:25.195
Norman Mailer readers?

42:26.177 --> 42:27.179
I don't know.

42:27.439 --> 42:27.820
I don't know.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.062
It's too early to tell.

42:29.082 --> 42:43.127
I think a lot of my normal readers, Norman's normal readers, I think a lot of people who like my work are going to be bothered by this book and find it odd.

42:43.546 --> 42:45.888
There are some who say, is Norman selling us out?

42:46.489 --> 42:47.089
There'll be that.

42:47.570 --> 42:57.338
There'll be other people who like my work, who will like this book very much, and will see the logical continuation of this, because ultimately I am a religious writer, for better or for worse.

42:57.959 --> 42:59.060
Just I have my own religion.

43:01.482 --> 43:04.344
My private religion, not my own religion.

43:07.767 --> 43:12.912
I think the people on the... I think the real audience for the book is probably those people who are

43:14.123 --> 43:23.614
Jewish but not devout, who are interested very much in the story because when you're Jewish, that story is away from you, apart from you.

43:24.535 --> 43:37.230
I mean, I know that for, certainly for the first half of my life, I lived in a Christian country, and while I knew a great deal about the country, I didn't feel I knew anything about the core of the country.

43:38.071 --> 43:42.496
So if a book like this had come along when I was 30 or 40, I would have read it with immense interest, I think.

43:43.057 --> 43:43.978
I'd like to think I would have.

43:44.718 --> 43:49.244
So I think for a great many Jews who are not terribly religious, this will be an interesting book.

43:49.705 --> 44:00.018
I think for a great many Christians who are not terribly religious, this will be an interesting book, because their knowledge of the Bible is about, of the New Testament, is about like my memory of the Old Testament.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.780
You see, that I had in childhood.

44:01.901 --> 44:05.806
And they'll go back to it with that, say, oh, this is more interesting than I thought.

44:06.086 --> 44:09.631
And then they'll say, well, let me look at it in the New Testament.

44:10.071 --> 44:12.835
In a certain place, they'll say, gee, Mary didn't get it, or they'll say,

44:13.338 --> 44:15.882
I like his version more than the way it's done here.

44:15.902 --> 44:28.339
You know, I was really looking for these really brilliant comments of Jesus that, you know, to explain, it had to be more than miracles, right, that occasioned his appeal.

44:28.960 --> 44:38.373
You know, you find some very interesting quotes, but maybe it was the writers of the Gospels afterwards who... Some of the quotes are from the Gospels.

44:38.393 --> 44:41.978
What I wanted was that people wouldn't be able to tell which were from the Gospels and which were not.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.003
unless they looked it up to see.

44:44.544 --> 44:46.667
I mean, there are lines in there.

44:46.687 --> 44:54.318
Some of these speeches, though, must be pretty much from the... The longer speeches, the Sermon from the Mount, it's taken entirely from the Sermon on the Mount.

44:54.418 --> 44:55.039
I abridged it.

44:56.622 --> 44:58.645
But that comes from that.

44:58.985 --> 45:03.612
But there were remarks there that I hope people will think it came from the New Testament.

45:03.878 --> 45:04.319
I did.

45:04.821 --> 45:06.525
And they didn't.

45:06.606 --> 45:06.947
Oh, really?

45:06.967 --> 45:08.090
So you said, you got me here.

45:08.190 --> 45:11.961
I didn't have a chance to go to the New Testament to compare them.

45:12.402 --> 45:14.929
My assumption was that they did come from the New Testament.

45:14.949 --> 45:15.531
Not all.

45:15.551 --> 45:16.112
Not all.

45:16.132 --> 45:16.433
Not all.

45:17.677 --> 45:17.837
Um...

45:26.508 --> 45:32.036
Anyway, you know, this is not an omnipotent God either, is this?

45:32.236 --> 45:32.457
No.

45:32.477 --> 45:33.618
This God loses back.

45:33.638 --> 45:34.720
Well, that's the huge difference.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.023
You see, people say it's a very reverential book.

45:37.704 --> 45:38.746
Well, it is up to a point.

45:38.806 --> 45:40.188
Beyond that point, it's not at all.

45:41.650 --> 45:43.613
And my feeling was— He loses.

45:43.873 --> 45:44.234
What?

45:44.254 --> 45:44.795
He loses.

45:44.895 --> 45:50.243
Yes, which is certainly a different version of the crucifixion than most people have.

45:50.343 --> 45:52.005
That's triumphant, supposedly.

45:52.045 --> 45:53.488
That's the great moment of triumph.

45:53.508 --> 45:53.848
Yes.

45:54.301 --> 45:56.324
But you don't say it that way at all.

45:56.724 --> 46:02.052
Maybe I was a godless materialist for too many years, but I simply couldn't understand that.

46:02.452 --> 46:04.996
I've never been able to understand that.

46:05.096 --> 46:05.957
It could be a lack of me.

46:06.478 --> 46:11.365
It takes a real leap of faith to believe that.

46:13.107 --> 46:14.910
And I've always found it very hard to understand.

46:14.950 --> 46:20.157
But I found it very hard to understand how a god who's all-good and all-powerful can permit the Holocaust.

46:20.643 --> 46:21.884
And I don't think I'm alone in that.

46:21.984 --> 46:24.027
Well, that's the great problem of our time, really.

46:24.207 --> 46:27.370
Yeah, well, the fact is no major— The philosophical problem of our time.

46:27.390 --> 46:32.096
Well, no major philosopher has come along since the Second World War.

46:32.816 --> 46:36.240
No philosopher of the stature of the philosophers of the 19th century.

46:37.361 --> 46:38.102
Makes sense.

46:38.142 --> 46:40.585
How can you deal with anything when you have to get by that?

46:40.785 --> 46:41.466
Yeah.

46:42.066 --> 46:49.975
Well, to me, and I am at my highest, I'm only a small and amateur philosopher.

46:50.512 --> 46:54.619
But it just seems to me that the moment you say, God may be all good, but he's not all powerful.

46:55.460 --> 46:57.143
Or if he's all powerful, he's not all good.

46:58.065 --> 46:59.387
So I prefer the first option.

46:59.888 --> 47:04.415
Do you remember that wonderful book about ten years ago, a great title, Why Did the Skies Not Darken?

47:04.716 --> 47:06.078
And that was about the Holocaust.

47:06.098 --> 47:07.500
Yeah, yeah.

47:07.701 --> 47:09.564
Why did the skies not darken?

47:10.425 --> 47:12.929
That's the essential dilemma right there, isn't it?

47:13.049 --> 47:13.370
Yeah.

47:13.390 --> 47:16.435
From a philosophical perspective, I guess.

47:17.579 --> 47:20.066
Listen, you've been generous with your time.

47:20.086 --> 47:22.594
I think we talked about the devil.

47:22.654 --> 47:28.010
The devil, anything I missed that we should go over?

47:28.030 --> 47:31.320
Well, I think I'd better take five minutes before the next gentleman arrives.

47:31.340 --> 47:32.483
Okay, what I'd like to do is...
