WEBVTT

00:15.472 --> 00:40.206
I have to tell you, somehow I never thought of this before.

00:40.226 --> 00:40.967
It occurred that you have to do this.

00:40.987 --> 00:41.428
But by August of 1980,

00:41.915 --> 00:50.271
It was really like zero budget.

00:51.293 --> 01:01.392
And I don't even know what it was going on.

01:02.013 --> 01:23.648
For the course of doing it, I've had a chance to meet the older generation.

01:23.668 --> 01:24.490
I've had a very extraordinary experience.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.012
Dear friends and I, I want you to know what my wife and I want you to know.

01:26.279 --> 01:41.256
I want you to know that my wife and I have had many difficulties in our decisions.

01:41.276 --> 01:48.304
Securing a home for our Yorishians, their inheritance, and their inheritance, of course, is of people who had no money, who had no means, but they were leaving the world with their books.

01:48.324 --> 01:51.508
And their own children weren't interested, and they wanted to come to us.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.730
And the whole letter is written in English?

01:52.750 --> 01:53.050
Yeah.

01:53.070 --> 01:53.310
That's nice.

01:53.330 --> 01:53.611
That's nice.

01:53.631 --> 01:53.871
I like that.

01:53.891 --> 01:53.991
Yeah.

01:54.325 --> 02:00.292
Yeah, it's about these encounters.

02:00.372 --> 02:05.879
Are you going to be able to give me a couple of these at some point?

02:06.339 --> 02:07.020
Some of these stories?

02:07.180 --> 02:07.380
Yeah.

02:07.801 --> 02:08.281
Sure, sure.

02:08.321 --> 02:10.664
I don't mean your writing.

02:10.885 --> 02:13.007
I mean, you know, you relate something.

02:13.387 --> 02:16.011
Yeah, I mean, there's really thousands of them.

02:16.071 --> 02:17.552
We've been on the road for five years almost all the time.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.855
Thousands of people in every place you went to.

02:19.875 --> 02:22.358
Are these basically people responding to your

02:22.827 --> 02:26.272
Yeah, people read about it.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.437
People who had books didn't know what to do about it.

02:29.457 --> 02:30.679
Things have changed a lot now.

02:30.719 --> 02:34.946
This was five years since I was on the road regularly myself.

02:35.547 --> 02:41.295
When I was on the road regularly, I was picking up probably 90% of our stops were from older Jews giving up to new libraries.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.238
Now it's just the opposite.

02:43.258 --> 02:46.303
I dealt with 10% of the books we pick up now come from older Jews.

02:46.688 --> 02:51.755
close-income children, grandchildren in the suburbs who have the parents and grandparents.

02:51.775 --> 02:56.521
So we really were right there in the crossroads between two generations, sort of that cusp of the world.

02:56.541 --> 02:56.741
Cusp.

02:57.242 --> 03:02.949
Yeah, the older generation was passing on, the newer generation was taking over.

03:03.009 --> 03:06.113
We were right there exactly at that just for a moment.

03:06.134 --> 03:11.040
If you had to pick any decade in the 20th century to do this, we were exactly at the right point.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.666
Did you find that it was kind of like you quoted that letter?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.404
You called that one.

03:19.505 --> 03:22.248
That you were taking something that was part of the person, part of the life.

03:23.169 --> 03:29.577
Did you ever have this feeling that you were receiving, accepting a tremendous gift that's almost a flesh and blood?

03:30.018 --> 03:31.319
Am I reaching too far on that?

03:31.379 --> 03:31.780
No, no, no.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.443
It was never a matter of just giving us promises.

03:34.463 --> 03:34.984
It was always an error.

03:35.504 --> 03:36.666
Giving us individual books.

03:36.786 --> 03:39.149
Almost always people would go through the book.

03:39.169 --> 03:41.952
Were there any tears at all?

03:41.972 --> 03:42.733
Almost always, yeah.

03:42.848 --> 03:49.794
This book in 1947, my wife and I, I remember the day we bought this book.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.416
We went without lunch for a week.

03:51.436 --> 03:52.617
We used to pull it.

03:52.637 --> 03:55.039
See, this is another thing I had in my book.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.462
Just about every important collector is a book person.

03:58.482 --> 04:00.004
You're a collector.

04:00.024 --> 04:01.045
Right, right, right.

04:01.065 --> 04:01.385
You are.

04:01.645 --> 04:03.527
You're in there as such.

04:03.547 --> 04:07.671
And I sort of anoint you as a collector.

04:07.711 --> 04:09.953
The true collector has a story for every book.

04:10.287 --> 04:14.172
You can't take a book off the shelf and just say, this is a book.

04:14.192 --> 04:15.773
It's a story.

04:16.614 --> 04:17.255
It goes with it.

04:17.796 --> 04:19.157
And everyone transports you.

04:19.257 --> 04:20.959
I mean, takes you to some point.

04:21.040 --> 04:21.981
Every book on a story.

04:22.001 --> 04:24.444
I thought it was very emotional.

04:24.464 --> 04:27.227
And books carry their baggage through time, I think.

04:27.247 --> 04:27.928
Of course.

04:27.948 --> 04:29.389
I'll tell you two stories.

04:29.409 --> 04:32.994
I'll give you some sense of personal emotion in it.

04:33.014 --> 04:34.395
One was a woman in Montreal.

04:34.415 --> 04:36.818
Towards the very beginning, we picked up what's going on.

04:37.355 --> 04:53.093
We got to her house, and she was a woman who did not speak with an accent.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.455
She actually had a British accent.

04:56.036 --> 04:59.900
Very, very articulate, very beautiful English.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.002
She had been born in London.

05:01.082 --> 05:04.105
She was Jewish, but had been born in London quite early.

05:04.928 --> 05:10.534
And she had married an East European Jewish refugee, and her husband was a Yiddish speaker.

05:10.554 --> 05:16.440
And she said, you know, she had a lot of books, maybe three or four big boxes of books for us.

05:16.460 --> 05:22.806
And she said, I want you to know that all my life I always looked down on my husband intellectually because he couldn't speak English.

05:23.667 --> 05:29.653
And I knew that he always read these Yiddish books, and I never understood what they were, and I always thought they were nothing, and I'm afraid I always denigrated him.

05:29.713 --> 05:33.197
And I look back on this now, and I feel very bad about what I did, but I never had

05:33.616 --> 05:36.179
I couldn't read these books, and I had no respect for this culture.

05:36.279 --> 05:39.043
I thought that English culture was a high point.

05:39.063 --> 05:40.665
So she never paid much attention to it.

05:40.685 --> 05:50.977
After her husband died, which was just recently, I started getting to wondering what these books might be, and I decided I really owe it to my husband's memory to do something about this psychology well.

05:50.997 --> 05:52.359
She says, can you tell me what the books are?

05:52.519 --> 05:53.881
So we started going through the boxes.

05:54.542 --> 05:59.708
It turned out she had in those boxes some of the rarest books to this day that we've ever found.

06:00.025 --> 06:16.513
There were bound volumes of publications printed by the Bund, the Jewish Labor Movement, the Jewish Socialist Movement in Russia, printed at the time of the 1905 revolution and a little before as well.

06:16.533 --> 06:25.729
So they were printed on the Bund's press abroad, mostly in London and Geneva, and then printed on tissue paper so they could be easily smuggled back into Russia, which was of course illegal.

06:26.789 --> 06:28.391
Almost all this stuff was destroyed.

06:28.451 --> 06:30.313
This printout tissue paper was smuggled into the country.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.694
Very little survived.

06:31.714 --> 06:34.477
She had books that existed nowhere else in the world.

06:34.497 --> 06:37.741
And what, somehow her husband had that human stuff.

06:37.761 --> 06:39.883
And they had the mark, they were all bound together.

06:39.903 --> 06:43.688
So it was five or six feet little pamphlets in a bound volume, a bound hardcover volume.

06:43.708 --> 06:47.632
And the books had the mark of a bookbinder in Montreal.

06:47.652 --> 06:49.534
And it was just a moonbinder on St.

06:49.554 --> 06:50.115
Lawrence Street in Montreal.

06:50.135 --> 06:51.396
And this guy had the bookbinder.

06:51.578 --> 06:57.226
a real scholar, a true historian, a true collection of saving his material.

06:57.466 --> 06:59.008
Mrs. Fletcher?

06:59.329 --> 07:00.010
Yeah.

07:00.030 --> 07:01.492
We don't remember the first name.

07:01.512 --> 07:02.934
We got to find it.

07:03.034 --> 07:03.555
Maybe.

07:03.575 --> 07:03.895
Maybe.

07:04.135 --> 07:04.416
Yeah.

07:04.436 --> 07:06.038
You're telling me that these are irreplaceable books?

07:06.138 --> 07:06.959
Oh, yeah.

07:06.979 --> 07:07.260
Yeah.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.325
I've probably been finding them.

07:11.345 --> 07:12.587
I think I know where.

07:12.607 --> 07:13.068
Where are they?

07:13.148 --> 07:21.079
Well, most of them ended up at a few places, Library of Congress, and a place called YIVO Institute in New York, which is the Central Yiddish Research Archive of the World, which exists in New York City, and a story in its own life.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.833
So she passed on that collection to us.

07:24.853 --> 07:28.737
And as I started taking them out, we explained what each book was and such and such.

07:28.757 --> 07:31.739
I thought I'd explain to her what this material was and how rare it was.

07:31.759 --> 07:32.580
And I remember her starting to climb.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.682
She was a very dignified woman.

07:34.702 --> 07:38.025
I remember the tears started to roll down her cheek.

07:38.045 --> 07:39.346
And she did know who her husband was.

07:39.366 --> 07:40.267
She was all these years.

07:40.287 --> 07:41.948
I never understood who one husband was.

07:41.968 --> 07:42.549
What did he do?

07:43.249 --> 07:43.810
What was his profession?

07:43.830 --> 07:45.972
I think there's probably a work on her own there.

07:45.992 --> 07:46.332
That's wonderful.

07:46.352 --> 07:46.452
Yeah.

07:46.472 --> 07:52.197
In the Jewish world, of course, you know, many Jews who were intellectuals who were just workers.

07:53.020 --> 07:58.326
But it was just a very intellectual culture.

07:58.346 --> 07:59.167
There was no connection.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.789
Do you remember the title of the books?

08:00.949 --> 08:03.732
Yeah, they were all published by the Burns Press.

08:03.752 --> 08:12.442
There would have been a revolutionary campus of various... Would you say of great interest to scholars at some point?

08:12.462 --> 08:14.664
Oh, enormous interest to scholars.

08:14.684 --> 08:15.365
No, enormous interest to scholars.

08:15.385 --> 08:16.326
These were lost words.

08:16.346 --> 08:17.788
Now, did you know this when you saw that?

08:18.549 --> 08:19.330
Yeah, I know Yiddish.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.492
So you'd become something of a Yiddish bibliographer then?

08:21.893 --> 08:25.898
Would you say that you have bibliographical skills?

08:25.918 --> 08:26.018
Sure.

08:26.038 --> 08:26.198
Sure.

08:26.218 --> 08:32.226
I know a lot about Jewish books that I've been working on.

08:32.246 --> 08:37.152
You can look at the title and say, this is a book.

08:37.232 --> 08:37.752
Oh, of course.

08:38.573 --> 08:39.434
You don't buy books.

08:41.196 --> 08:42.178
That's important.

08:42.198 --> 08:43.399
No, we have an absolute policy.

08:43.499 --> 08:44.861
Tell me about that.

08:44.881 --> 08:47.304
We only accept contributions.

08:47.324 --> 08:49.867
We've never bought a book in all this time.

08:49.887 --> 08:50.668
We've collected over 900,000 pounds.

08:50.986 --> 08:51.948
And that's not your mission.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.953
Your mission is not to buy books and sell them.

08:55.514 --> 08:57.657
We're a non-profit organization.

08:57.677 --> 09:01.904
Our work is to collect the books and then get them back into circulation.

09:01.924 --> 09:04.348
To rescue and retrieve, I guess, or retrieve and rescue.

09:04.388 --> 09:07.694
Yeah, to rescue Yiddish books and return them back.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.958
Take old books and put them in the hands of new readers.

09:09.998 --> 09:13.163
Now you have 900,000 books at your home.

09:13.885 --> 09:17.809
I'm going to just tell you one other story first, the same kind of story.

09:17.829 --> 09:18.911
I love that story.

09:18.931 --> 09:21.213
Yeah, another one, exactly the same kind of thing.

09:21.253 --> 09:38.032
A woman in New York, her husband had been a man named Philip Sandwick, who was the editor of one of the Yiddish newspapers in New York City, a news editor, a managing editor of one of the papers.

09:38.052 --> 09:39.153
And this is also quite a while ago now.

09:39.173 --> 09:40.474
We went into her apartment.

09:40.494 --> 09:41.095
She's not lying.

09:41.115 --> 09:42.036
Her husband had died.

09:42.404 --> 09:45.727
And it was quite late at night.

09:45.747 --> 09:49.511
We probably got there by 11 o'clock.

09:49.691 --> 09:52.014
We usually try to do a lot of pickups in the day.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.135
We'd get very far behind schedule.

09:53.155 --> 09:54.616
I remember her sitting at the kitchen table.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.678
Two of us were hauling out the books while two of us sat with her holding her hand.

09:56.698 --> 09:58.440
And again, she was just crying and crying.

09:59.141 --> 10:03.946
She was almost like they're taking out the body all over her hands without lying.

10:03.966 --> 10:06.448
And of course, they'd be taking out these books and all the time.

10:06.468 --> 10:06.869
It's hard, physical.

10:06.889 --> 10:08.590
I mean, it's hard, physical.

10:08.610 --> 10:08.971
I mean, it's hard.

10:08.991 --> 10:10.352
The logistics of it is tough enough to begin with.

10:10.670 --> 10:11.911
It was a very emotional encounter.

10:11.932 --> 10:15.015
This happened over and over and over again, I remember.

10:15.476 --> 10:16.177
I love this story.

10:16.197 --> 10:16.958
I don't know where I read it.

10:16.978 --> 10:18.139
Was it the Atlantic City?

10:18.279 --> 10:19.220
Oh, yeah.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.463
That was the great first pickup I ever did there.

10:22.044 --> 10:25.728
He said, young man, you haven't even gone upstairs.

10:25.748 --> 10:26.909
Yeah, he took me through the whole building.

10:26.929 --> 10:28.772
Every single person in the building had stuff.

10:28.872 --> 10:30.113
And everyone had stuff.

10:30.133 --> 10:32.536
So you were late for the Philly appointment, but it was worth it.

10:32.957 --> 10:33.718
How large is the truck?

10:33.738 --> 10:34.939
Is that a ton, by the way?

10:35.476 --> 10:39.302
Yeah, we can put about two and a half tons on it.

10:39.322 --> 10:40.504
I'm not sure what the rating is.

10:40.524 --> 10:48.096
I know it sounds crazy, all these little points, but I mean, we have another truck out there, two and a half tons, and the mission of that truck is to go out and pick up books.

10:48.136 --> 10:50.720
It's like a book ambulance is what it is.

10:50.740 --> 10:51.200
Yeah, exactly.

10:51.221 --> 10:57.030
That truck we got much later enough where I wish we had had that in the early days.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.211
You say that's a policy.

10:58.372 --> 10:59.914
You will not buy books.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.449
And you arrived at that from the beginning.

11:03.609 --> 11:07.153
Yeah, people get tax write-offs for giving us books.

11:07.173 --> 11:11.637
Well, what if somebody had something that was a season of... They wanted to sell?

11:11.817 --> 11:12.277
Yeah.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.599
What would you do?

11:13.699 --> 11:19.264
If they think they can make money on selling a book, you know, it's trying to create a market and they're guessing that you use it.

11:19.384 --> 11:24.008
And if somebody buys it, they're probably going to protect it.

11:24.028 --> 11:24.569
Yeah, exactly.

11:24.589 --> 11:25.209
But it hasn't happened.

11:25.229 --> 11:28.933
No, but that's... Because a lot of what I'm writing about is the marketplace, too.

11:29.013 --> 11:30.154
Yeah, but we try...

11:30.742 --> 11:33.345
We've done two things, actually, with the marketplace.

11:33.405 --> 11:37.351
When we started out, English books were a very peculiar commodity.

11:37.371 --> 11:52.711
You'd either find them at enormously high prices, you know, a real catalog or some European book dealer, you know, some very, very rare thing, or else you'd find them in a garbage can, you'd find them in a Goodwill store or in a Hadassah store, you know, for a buck and a 50 cent.

11:52.731 --> 11:54.613
When we started out, we'd distribute books as well.

11:55.374 --> 11:58.318
We'd charge, you know, a reasonable price for distributing books.

11:58.636 --> 12:03.042
$7, $10, $15, depending on the book that we're sending to libraries.

12:03.062 --> 12:06.447
We were very insistent about that, right, from the beginning, about that as well.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.431
First of all, it brings in part of our income, 20% version.

12:10.793 --> 12:15.620
But for a more important reason, we thought Yiddish has to be regarded like all other literatures.

12:15.640 --> 12:21.408
The first editions in Yiddish were selling for 50 cents, but the first edition of a great writer in other language might be selling for $50,000.

12:21.428 --> 12:22.730
It just was wrong.

12:22.870 --> 12:27.276
In Yiddish in the world, literature needs to be regarded as such.

12:27.695 --> 12:33.601
for years and years as to how Yiddish is inferior, or that Yiddish was a vernacular, or it wasn't really a language.

12:33.621 --> 12:35.583
A vernacular, oh, that's what you got as inferior.

12:35.603 --> 12:37.165
Yeah, this isn't a bastard language.

12:37.185 --> 12:39.627
But you cannot dismiss the great writers who had written that.

12:40.228 --> 12:41.889
Well, they were dismissed for a long time, though.

12:41.909 --> 12:47.335
You know, it's only recently that we didn't get their due or that Yiddish books become recognized.

12:47.355 --> 12:50.238
So a lot of our work now is trying to get the books back in circulation.

12:50.258 --> 12:52.620
That's really what our primary effort is.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.145
We'll see down in Holyoke when they were in an enormous operation there, where the books are now finally all sorted.

12:57.715 --> 13:02.881
And now we're putting them onto a computer system, a Vax computer, and sweat everything out on there.

13:02.901 --> 13:05.423
And then we send lists off regularly to libraries all over the world.

13:05.924 --> 13:08.507
So we're the only supplier of Yiddish books in the world today.

13:08.527 --> 13:12.170
There is no other, or at least no other comprehensive supplier.

13:12.190 --> 13:18.237
And we used to have about 70 libraries, something called the Library Development Program, the Yiddish Library Development Program.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.078
That's the name of Yiddish?

13:19.098 --> 13:19.278
Yes.

13:19.378 --> 13:20.960
Library Development Program.

13:20.980 --> 13:21.520
I'll give you a brochure.

13:21.540 --> 13:24.904
And there are about 70 libraries around the world participating in this.

13:25.475 --> 13:30.120
where we even give them complete collections of British literature, completely cataloging.

13:30.140 --> 13:36.548
Or they simply acquire individual books, they go through our printouts, and they fill the holes in their own collections.

13:36.568 --> 13:38.350
Are you making editorial decisions?

13:38.810 --> 13:40.132
And not decisions, but judgments.

13:41.313 --> 13:43.035
It's more important than that.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.917
Oh, of course.

13:44.997 --> 13:48.721
And you do have people down there who are trained to do it, who are trained to do this.

13:49.082 --> 13:50.183
It's the nature of the world.

13:51.074 --> 13:52.556
And then maybe I'll talk to them.

13:52.576 --> 13:59.066
There's a woman who has a note, a short article.

13:59.087 --> 14:00.048
You got it from Israel, I guess.

14:00.068 --> 14:00.409
Yeah, Maccabee.

14:00.429 --> 14:02.051
She sounds like she'd be left left out.

14:02.071 --> 14:05.016
Yeah, you step and spend time speaking with her.

14:05.036 --> 14:10.104
She's really the hero of all this, and that she took the operation on Holiok.

14:11.746 --> 14:15.232
Three years ago, when she started, Holiok was just a disaster area.

14:15.252 --> 14:18.617
I mean, it was just literally mountains and mountains and mountains of books.

14:19.070 --> 14:21.573
Just all piled loose, you know, hundreds of thousands.

14:21.593 --> 14:23.815
So phase one, basically, was to go and get it.

14:24.536 --> 14:25.036
Exactly.

14:25.056 --> 14:26.218
Get it and save it.

14:26.238 --> 14:32.364
Then phase whatever, all right, now we can catalog it and put it away and maybe find your own story.

14:32.384 --> 14:36.108
Yeah, phase two was getting the books into certain processing them in order to get them into certain things.

14:36.128 --> 14:37.490
But I see these photographs.

14:37.610 --> 14:37.950
Yes.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.072
It doesn't look that way anymore.

14:39.092 --> 14:39.672
All the books.

14:39.692 --> 14:40.813
They have the before and after.

14:40.874 --> 14:41.574
Yeah, yeah.

14:41.594 --> 14:42.555
The books are on shelves now.

14:42.575 --> 14:44.818
What's this thing with Yale, 10,000 books like that?

14:44.938 --> 14:46.900
That's one of the biggest things we've done so far.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.083
Our real goal is to get Yiddish books into the world's great libraries.

14:50.744 --> 14:54.228
Up until recently, most of the world's great libraries never had Yiddish collection.

14:54.248 --> 14:57.371
Harvard is an exception.

14:57.391 --> 15:00.194
But most of the great libraries never had Yiddish books.

15:00.214 --> 15:07.683
When the books were in print, it was seen as, you know, workers' literature or vernacular or, you know, it wasn't regarded as world literature.

15:07.723 --> 15:10.045
No one recognized its value anymore.

15:10.065 --> 15:11.307
So the books were largely ignored.

15:12.008 --> 15:16.853
Now, when suddenly the value of Yiddish literature has become apparent, and now we understand that.

15:17.356 --> 15:21.101
They're both crucial historical sources for understanding the European Jewish experience.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.124
And it's a great literature in its own right.

15:23.144 --> 15:36.763
I mean, the Shabbat Singer won the Nobel Prize in 78, Elie Wiesel who also won the Nobel Peace Prize with his first book written in Yiddish.

15:38.506 --> 15:42.812
So suddenly libraries understand or scholars understand the value of this literature.

15:43.232 --> 15:45.135
It was our goal to get those books into place.

15:45.841 --> 15:48.844
At Yale, we set up a collection of 10,000 volumes.

15:48.984 --> 15:55.011
It was a very big thing called a Joseph and Rosalind Newman, N-E-W-M-A-N, collection.

15:55.031 --> 15:59.236
And again, I'll give you names of people to speak with about this, because that was a really significant thing.

15:59.256 --> 16:01.899
And going down to Yale, I'm just going to step up and find it.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.100
Oh, you should definitely speak with people.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.082
I'll give you two names down there.

16:05.282 --> 16:07.505
The collection at Yale was a major turning point for us.

16:07.765 --> 16:08.506
And this was when?

16:08.526 --> 16:10.528
This was last year, I think.

16:10.548 --> 16:15.173
Yeah, because it was the first time that a major library, and we are, I think, the seventh largest library,

16:15.457 --> 16:23.025
And it's the first time that a library of that statue recognized the importance of Yiddish in what they call retrospectively.

16:23.045 --> 16:27.849
You know, it went back and picked up out-of-print Yiddish books, a collection of 10,000 volumes.

16:27.909 --> 16:30.252
It's highly significant.

16:30.272 --> 16:33.715
Yeah, the Yale thing is really highly significant in many ways.

16:33.735 --> 16:36.578
It's really the vindication of much of what it is.

16:36.598 --> 16:37.359
It really is.

16:37.479 --> 16:41.343
And since Yale did that, many other libraries all over the world have fallen asleep.

16:41.363 --> 16:42.544
It kind of just made it clear that

16:43.098 --> 16:50.449
Any library wanting to have serious Jewish holdings simply has to come to terms with the initial agent, and that's now become apparent.

16:50.469 --> 16:54.756
Let's clarify that point, and it's an absolute discernment.

16:54.776 --> 16:56.458
So were the people there?

16:56.478 --> 16:59.523
There were two people.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.347
The bibliographer, the one who's .

17:02.367 --> 17:03.449
L-E-R-M-A-N.

17:03.469 --> 17:04.070
L-E-R-M-A-N.

17:04.090 --> 17:04.190
Yeah.

17:04.210 --> 17:08.076
She's a good person to speak with in every way.

17:13.388 --> 17:21.158
Yeah, plus Yale's whole set up there is just beautiful.

17:21.178 --> 17:22.300
It's love there.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.022
It really is.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.906
It's one of those great libraries where it gives you a sense of all of them.

17:26.926 --> 17:32.693
Oh, see, I'll be writing about Texas and BU only because they've built interesting collections in the last 30 years.

17:33.154 --> 17:38.881
But again, don't think for one second and how many of them are in Harvard Yale.

17:38.901 --> 17:39.322
Right.

17:39.342 --> 17:39.442
Yeah.

17:39.462 --> 17:41.184
And we're still quite a bit at Harvard now also.

17:41.204 --> 17:43.227
Not to be those ones who tell you about all these drafts.

17:43.358 --> 17:45.380
I don't have a bibliography.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.882
Okay, well, she's in Yale, right?

17:46.902 --> 17:49.886
Yeah, she's the Judaica bibliography, Yale.

17:50.166 --> 17:53.910
Actually, the other person there is the head of collection development.

17:53.930 --> 17:56.553
My name is Michael Keller, K-E-L-L-E-R.

17:57.414 --> 17:58.335
His number is 203-432-1764.

17:58.355 --> 18:00.017
1764.

18:00.217 --> 18:05.283
Head of what was his title?

18:05.303 --> 18:07.866
Collections Development, the assistant director.

18:07.946 --> 18:09.168
All collections?

18:09.188 --> 18:11.931
Yeah, all collections.

18:12.113 --> 18:28.050
The other person is a key player, and there's a people who gave the money to get on the scrolls, but they might be willing to tell you, but the people who put up this very substantial fund, not only for the acquisition of the books, but in order to have them cataloged as well.

18:28.070 --> 18:33.836
There was a terrific couple who had a lot of foresight, basically, named Joe and Roz Newman.

18:33.856 --> 18:35.077
Joe and Roz Newman.

18:35.097 --> 18:36.899
Yeah, Roz Newman.

18:37.039 --> 18:39.622
R-O-S-A-L-Y-N, I guess.

18:39.642 --> 18:40.062
Joe and Roz Newman.

18:41.020 --> 18:46.188
They're in Florida right now.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.693
Joe's number is 407-588-7032.

18:50.495 --> 18:52.037
That's the Florida number?

18:52.137 --> 18:52.277
Yes.

18:52.297 --> 18:52.598
7032?

18:52.618 --> 18:52.878
Yes.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.262
And where are they from?

18:55.322 --> 18:57.906
From Scarsdale.

18:58.206 --> 18:59.208
You got the Scarsdale number?

18:59.228 --> 19:02.393
Yeah, number in Scarsdale, 914-723-0898.

19:02.493 --> 19:06.880
They enable this.

19:07.440 --> 19:07.821
Exactly.

19:08.138 --> 19:09.780
And they really had the visions on the stand.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.421
I saw their names sometimes.

19:11.461 --> 19:13.924
Probably in our newsletter where they describe what they had done here.

19:13.984 --> 19:14.965
Well, that's possible.

19:14.985 --> 19:17.087
It's been a bit of press.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.709
Oh, I just read it last night.

19:18.769 --> 19:19.370
Thanks.

19:19.430 --> 19:19.750
All right.

19:19.850 --> 19:20.231
Yeah.

19:21.131 --> 19:21.492
Okay.

19:21.812 --> 19:22.213
Let's go.

19:22.793 --> 19:23.053
Continue.

19:23.314 --> 19:25.896
I've got a half an hour for you tonight.

19:25.997 --> 19:27.138
Okay.

19:27.678 --> 19:29.981
Some of the collective stories we can do next time.

19:30.061 --> 19:30.641
Okay.

19:30.661 --> 19:31.582
We'll be fresher again.

19:31.943 --> 19:33.184
The last piece of it, though, is just

19:33.637 --> 19:36.540
that we've moved beyond just collecting and distributing books.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.942
That's really been the core of our work in the first 10 years.

19:39.463 --> 19:46.229
Now we're reaching into the third phase of our work, which, as we say, is to open up the books and let the world know what's inside of them.

19:46.249 --> 20:01.804
I mean, when you walk into Holy, if you understand what I'm saying, but you walk in there, then you look at this vast, expanse of books in this very large place, and a great many books in the shelves, and you realize that what is here are not just old books, but it's an entire civilization.

20:02.527 --> 20:05.350
It's a whole world, it's a whole universe.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.152
Do that hit you any on that?

20:07.172 --> 20:08.573
Sometimes I go there, not always.

20:08.673 --> 20:14.459
You know, you're busy and it's hard and you're driving trucks and things, you know, heavy duty, industrial process to handle all this.

20:14.480 --> 20:23.229
But sometimes if I come in there late at night, you know, I need to take care of something and I walk in there and I see the light coming in and I see those books there, I suddenly understand what this means.

20:23.909 --> 20:28.174
This is a civilization, it's the whole world here that was almost destroyed.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.096
And this is what remains.

20:30.116 --> 20:31.217
I see that often, you know,

20:31.602 --> 20:38.512
And oftentimes we'll have people come up there, particularly when they're Holocaust survivors or people who came from Eastern America.

20:38.532 --> 20:39.794
And I've noticed this for years now.

20:39.814 --> 20:44.260
They come up on the elevator and walk up the stairs there.

20:44.280 --> 20:50.109
And they walk into that room and they just stop in their tracks.

20:50.129 --> 20:52.111
And more often than not, they just burst out into tears.

20:52.131 --> 20:53.974
I mean, these are people who are emotional people.

20:53.994 --> 20:55.576
Yeah, and they just shift their time.

20:55.596 --> 20:56.698
And I mean, time at the time, they'll say to them,

20:57.708 --> 21:02.214
people who survived the death camps, who lost their families, who lost everything.

21:02.234 --> 21:03.957
I thought this world was destroyed.

21:03.977 --> 21:07.161
I didn't know to see that this has survived.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.884
You're doing things other than books, I noticed.

21:08.924 --> 21:09.264
Music.

21:10.406 --> 21:13.450
Yeah, we take not just books, but any written books.

21:13.471 --> 21:16.895
And I guess you're doing some of these on tape.

21:16.915 --> 21:17.496
You're making them available.

21:17.556 --> 21:19.459
Yeah, that's another program we have.

21:19.499 --> 21:19.980
That's interesting.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.004
Yeah, and we're really trying to make the literature accessible in a way.

21:23.024 --> 21:26.449
To understand what's there, and it's a whole world that almost was destroyed.

21:26.783 --> 21:28.345
that almost no one knows of anymore.

21:28.365 --> 21:31.829
In fact, these books are sitting in an old factory in Holyoke, Massachusetts.

21:33.070 --> 21:35.232
Somehow this has to come out of the broader world.

21:35.312 --> 21:39.197
Yeah, there are, what, 900,000 books there, or you have retrieved 900,000 books?

21:39.317 --> 21:41.519
Yeah, there were probably almost 700,000 or 800,000 books there.

21:41.539 --> 21:43.201
And how many of you placed, would you say?

21:43.421 --> 21:44.262
I'm not sure.

21:44.282 --> 21:48.247
Maccabee could tell you that there's a nine-month.

21:48.267 --> 21:49.708
Give me an idea, but I will understand.

21:49.768 --> 21:54.073
So in other words, nine-tenths, 90% of what you've acquired

21:54.779 --> 21:56.801
You only want to until you're short.

21:57.222 --> 22:00.325
It's like you just don't send your child out.

22:00.465 --> 22:03.669
What we're doing is developing the demand for the books.

22:03.729 --> 22:05.431
Remember, when we started, there was no demand.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.313
No one wanted these books.

22:07.333 --> 22:11.798
We are educating the world as to why these books are important to get people to read them once again.

22:11.818 --> 22:14.181
So our primary goal is the university libraries right now.

22:14.201 --> 22:16.143
Eventually, we'll do reprint editions as well.

22:16.163 --> 22:19.707
Of course, we don't have enough duplicate copies of what we can reprint them.

22:20.092 --> 22:22.235
Do you insist on keeping one copy of everything?

22:22.295 --> 22:27.743
No, we make sure that one copy goes into one of several major libraries so we have access to it.

22:27.763 --> 22:34.652
And we maintain a permanent loan collection at the YIVO, at the major Yiddish research institute in New York, at the Library of Congress, Harvard, and Vienna.

22:34.672 --> 22:37.436
So between those four libraries, one copy.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.979
Who do you deal with at Harvard?

22:38.999 --> 22:39.740
Roger Stott?

22:40.080 --> 22:43.585
No, there's Charles Berlin.

22:44.425 --> 22:47.429
But again, you should speak to Maccabees first, and she can tell you all about it.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.731
I'm going to set up some standards, too.

22:48.751 --> 22:51.636
Tell me about the Soviet Union, though, for some time.

22:51.656 --> 22:51.756
Okay.

22:51.776 --> 22:53.538
Soviet Union's kind of a side story, as well.

22:53.558 --> 22:55.341
Let me just finish what we're doing now.

22:55.401 --> 23:01.089
Our work now is much more geared with an educational program, to let the world know it's inside the literature.

23:01.129 --> 23:05.376
Back in 83, we started a week-long summer program in Yiddish culture for adults.

23:06.237 --> 23:09.842
First year we offered it, we had 45 places, and got 2,000 applications.

23:10.480 --> 23:15.365
we realize how much thirst there is for substantive Jewish learning in this country right now.

23:15.385 --> 23:16.546
And we're hoping to respond to that.

23:16.586 --> 23:28.258
Eventually we want to develop a year-round conference center where we'll have visiting faculty and have adult education programs year-round to teach teachers, to teach community leaders about the world.

23:28.278 --> 23:33.463
We're at an historical moment where it's 45, 50 years after the Holocaust.

23:33.483 --> 23:36.066
We're ready to pick up a piece of a world that was almost destroyed.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.684
We have the books in place now.

23:37.704 --> 23:38.666
That was the precondition.

23:38.686 --> 23:42.672
Without the books, there was no access to the world of East Jersey and Jewish culture.

23:42.692 --> 23:45.737
Now that we have the books, we let people know what they're all about.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.642
We'll be doing much more educational work for years and years going on.

23:49.603 --> 23:50.565
How about individuals?

23:50.625 --> 23:53.089
Do you replace books with individuals?

23:53.109 --> 23:56.915
Students, scholars, we have enough copies of the books.

23:56.955 --> 24:03.606
Books we have, four or five, ten copies, and we know there's not a huge demand in the library, then we'll make them available individually.

24:03.856 --> 24:05.959
Right now, really, it's repositories.

24:05.979 --> 24:08.061
It's largely libraries right now.

24:08.101 --> 24:08.642
That's the future.

24:08.662 --> 24:10.144
Books will be available forever.

24:10.164 --> 24:10.344
Yeah.

24:10.624 --> 24:11.646
But we do have a program.

24:11.666 --> 24:21.918
We have something called the Gilpin, G-I-L-P-I-N, Yiddish Student Book Fund, in which we provide subsidies to college students who want to buy Yiddish books.

24:22.018 --> 24:22.960
They join this fund.

24:22.980 --> 24:27.245
And they can get books in which we have a lot of copies of the books they're using in their own studies.

24:27.265 --> 24:30.689
They can get, usually, from, I think, about 10% of the college students.

24:30.709 --> 24:32.952
They're a cost of a dollar a book or something, or 50% of it.

24:33.607 --> 24:40.281
I guess at some point we have to talk about the MacArthur grant, the genius grant.

24:40.301 --> 24:44.910
How do you feel uncomfortable when you describe it when you receive the genius grant?

24:45.792 --> 24:47.455
I don't think it was one way or the other.

24:47.475 --> 24:49.018
I mean, the grant was a great thing.

24:49.079 --> 24:54.670
Bill, William Kennedy, who I'd like to use MacArthur grant.

24:54.953 --> 25:01.384
It's made me, it's allowed me to write a little bit now.

25:01.424 --> 25:10.519
But I have to believe you're the only book collector, in a very generic sense, who's been so designated.

25:10.539 --> 25:18.733
The issue I'm struggling with is that the books are the way in which to preserve the culture, not just the books themselves.

25:19.422 --> 25:20.524
What's inside the book?

25:20.744 --> 25:23.649
Most book collectors are interested in that.

25:23.669 --> 25:25.131
Many book collectors are interested in that.

25:25.151 --> 25:27.875
There's a book of first editions, the rare editions.

25:27.895 --> 25:28.937
The scarcity.

25:28.957 --> 25:33.303
Yeah, those aren't much more interested in the inscribable value of the literature at this point.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.008
Whatever a book is a first edition is quite irrelevant to you.

25:36.028 --> 25:39.172
Most of the Yiddish literature is rare, right?

25:39.193 --> 25:41.957
But yes, that's not the point.

25:41.977 --> 25:43.399
What is this literature?

25:43.419 --> 25:44.100
What does it have to say to us?

25:44.120 --> 25:45.362
Does it have to state the world for them?

25:45.832 --> 26:01.427
is the people who lived on the outside of European civilization for a thousand years developed a very different moral view of the world, a very different point of view and political.

26:01.447 --> 26:03.830
And I think it's a great deal to stay for that.

26:03.850 --> 26:10.136
The people who didn't march off to war, the people who weren't part of that whole militarist traditional line of the core of our culture.

26:10.156 --> 26:10.556
What does that mean?

26:10.576 --> 26:13.339
What does that culture get to help the state of the world, especially now with nuclear weapons with a very different way?

26:13.359 --> 26:14.320
We're all in the same boat, in effect.

26:14.772 --> 26:26.830
When we talk about preserving, saving, retrieving, what would you say is the scarcest, most extraordinary plan?

26:26.910 --> 26:29.514
I noticed in this most recent book cover you've seen.

26:29.574 --> 26:32.218
That's probably the one.

26:32.238 --> 26:32.919
That's quite it.

26:32.979 --> 26:33.360
I read it.

26:34.101 --> 26:37.066
I thought the magazine, by the way, was quite excellent.

26:37.366 --> 26:38.348
Thank you.

26:38.368 --> 26:39.970
I read it coming to the cover last year.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.626
Yeah, there were other things like that, but that one was not .

26:44.868 --> 26:47.512
And then you also made an appeal to find out the provenance.

26:47.532 --> 26:48.733
That's where it came from, yeah.

26:48.753 --> 26:49.855
We found out more .

26:49.875 --> 26:57.886
Yeah, as soon as the book was broadcast, probably right after that, as far as we know, it was there when the book was published.

26:58.948 --> 27:03.133
It took it just before all the other copies were confiscated, and you never realized .

27:03.153 --> 27:06.498
The night I found that book, one of our interns found it in a box.

27:06.518 --> 27:08.000
We teach them what to look for.

27:08.020 --> 27:08.841
An intern found it?

27:08.982 --> 27:09.282
Yeah.

27:09.532 --> 27:12.155
Tell me a little bit about that.

27:12.175 --> 27:17.342
One of the interests, you know, that we teach them rare books and Soviet imprints from that period are very rare.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.725
We teach them what to look for generally.

27:19.745 --> 27:21.928
They bring rare books and compile them up.

27:21.948 --> 27:23.270
Do they get excited too?

27:23.410 --> 27:24.311
Oh, yeah.

27:24.331 --> 27:27.215
There's no way to know what's valuable, what's not.

27:27.235 --> 27:30.940
You don't have to pile these books up, and I don't look through them, I don't have to be able to do them.

27:30.960 --> 27:35.826
This particular book hasn't been found before in a pile, and I finally got around to going through it.

27:36.397 --> 27:44.606
And I was sitting here at my desk and I was looking through these books.

27:44.626 --> 27:46.909
About 8 o'clock at night, I was working pretty late that night.

27:46.929 --> 27:48.630
And I looked at that book and I had never seen it before.

27:48.650 --> 27:56.579
And it was very unlikely that a book that was found in court, the lexicon of foreign terminology was very critical because it shows how Jews are perceiving the outside world at that time.

27:56.599 --> 27:59.562
It was a critical book from the scholarly point of view.

27:59.583 --> 28:03.687
So I knew that I really needed to understand what the, you know,

28:04.072 --> 28:05.574
I couldn't understand why I've never heard of it before.

28:05.594 --> 28:07.017
And there are no references for you to go to.

28:07.037 --> 28:08.539
That's another problem that you have.

28:08.559 --> 28:11.083
Well, we have the Library of Congress card catalogs here.

28:11.103 --> 28:12.145
We have Evo's card catalogs.

28:12.165 --> 28:14.528
I looked at both of those and the book book was there.

28:14.548 --> 28:15.870
But suddenly I know it's buried alive.

28:15.910 --> 28:17.433
And I guess it's probably an only copy of it.

28:17.453 --> 28:18.735
It has your attention at this point.

28:18.755 --> 28:21.059
Yeah, definitely there's a good chance to be on the copy.

28:21.559 --> 28:21.760
Excellent.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.462
Either of those copies.

28:23.482 --> 28:25.526
Either of those catalogs.

28:25.586 --> 28:27.749
But I couldn't find mention of it.

28:27.769 --> 28:29.011
I couldn't find anything.

28:29.031 --> 28:29.952
I was getting a later thing.

28:30.033 --> 28:31.174
Nine o'clock now, it's dark.

28:31.254 --> 28:32.256
I'll tell you the Sunday night.

28:32.978 --> 28:46.720
Finally, in one of the biographical dictionaries of the author in Yiddish, it says how this guy worked throughout the later part of the 1920s, preparing this lexicon of political and moral terminologies in Yiddish.

28:46.740 --> 28:47.802
This was his magnum opus.

28:47.822 --> 28:58.619
The book was published in 1929, but all copies were confiscated by the KGB upon publication, and all copies were destroyed.

28:58.639 --> 28:59.020
No copies survived.

29:00.012 --> 29:00.513
I'm reading this.

29:00.813 --> 29:03.758
I'm holding this thing on my hand.

29:04.700 --> 29:05.581
I didn't know what to do.

29:05.601 --> 29:06.162
First, I ran.

29:06.182 --> 29:07.505
I turned on the bird girl.

29:07.565 --> 29:09.147
I didn't know what to do.

29:09.168 --> 29:10.630
The next morning, I called out.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.333
You went and turned on a bird girl.

29:12.413 --> 29:15.638
I said, you really want to treasure this.

29:15.719 --> 29:18.483
And the condition, apparently, is excellent.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.687
Very good.

29:21.443 --> 29:24.831
Then did anyone else corroborate this, or was this pretty much your research?

29:24.951 --> 29:28.700
No, then the guy who wrote that article, Zachary Baker, is probably the greatest.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.484
Was he excited when you thought he was thrilled?

29:30.504 --> 29:31.085
What did he say?

29:31.346 --> 29:32.709
Oh, he couldn't believe it.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.152
He quickly ran and researched it.

29:34.633 --> 29:37.680
He found there wasn't one microfilm copy of somewhere

29:38.420 --> 29:41.944
Somehow, if someone's had this one microphone copy, at least they thought they'd give yours.

29:41.964 --> 29:44.346
So now yours, your copy went to New York, right?

29:44.366 --> 29:46.429
Yeah, it's the copy right now.

29:46.449 --> 29:47.450
It is the deep copy?

29:47.470 --> 29:47.690
Wow.

29:48.150 --> 29:51.714
Yeah, there may be a copy in Israel, but I'm not sure.

29:51.734 --> 29:51.934
Exactly.

29:51.955 --> 29:55.098
Are you placing any books in Israel, by the way?

29:55.118 --> 29:55.939
A lot, certainly.

29:55.959 --> 29:57.500
Yeah, all the major numbers.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.882
That's great.

29:58.902 --> 29:59.262
Yeah.

29:59.282 --> 30:05.289
Are there any other cultural groups that you think could do the same kind of thing as you're doing?

30:05.329 --> 30:08.292
Or is the English pretty much a unique...

30:08.693 --> 30:10.975
Of reclaiming a whole literature like that?

30:10.995 --> 30:11.116
Yeah.

30:11.136 --> 30:15.841
Well, I think there's always work to be done, but I think it isn't unique.

30:15.861 --> 30:16.021
It is.

30:16.741 --> 30:18.904
I mean, there isn't anything like an American Indian zone.

30:19.204 --> 30:27.192
No, it was a unique historical phenomenon in the sense that it was a recent literature, a very compressed literary development.

30:27.212 --> 30:28.874
So reclaimable, if you work with it.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.756
Yeah, it was a very compressed literary development.

30:30.816 --> 30:37.283
All these titles, 40,000 titles in a period of 60 or 70 years, were published in large numbers.

30:37.972 --> 30:44.922
and then quickly the literature's cut off the population and potentially destroyed and then the books remain as the record of that culture.

30:44.942 --> 30:54.536
I'm not sure it's... You don't know whether this furnishes an example, say, for some... Oh, I would like to think it does, but I'm not sure any other cultures are going to yield a million books.

30:54.556 --> 30:56.939
I'm not sure any other cultures... Are millions, I wonder?

30:57.200 --> 31:00.845
Well, I don't think any other cultures have that kind of disruption.

31:00.865 --> 31:03.709
Again, the fact that Yiddish never had a country in that sense, Yiddish is

31:04.617 --> 31:08.742
I was just going to say almost unique because I was thinking of Romani as the other.

31:08.762 --> 31:10.744
I don't know if there's one of the universe.

31:10.764 --> 31:12.326
I don't know the answer to that.

31:13.147 --> 31:19.534
But Yiddish is certainly unique as a strong literary tradition for a language without a country.

31:19.554 --> 31:24.480
Another characteristic point is almost the same thing with the Esperanto, which works on these books in Toronto.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.061
But that was almost a Jewish invention.

31:26.121 --> 31:31.047
They said that the Esperanto conventions and war started in the 1930s.

31:31.448 --> 31:40.601
You want to do the collecting stories like the next time?

31:40.722 --> 31:42.845
Yeah, we'll do that in another question.

31:42.865 --> 31:45.248
Because I think we've hit a lot of excellent things.

31:45.268 --> 31:45.529
Good.

31:45.649 --> 31:48.132
And this will give me a chance really to assess what we've done.

31:48.232 --> 31:48.893
That's fine.

31:48.934 --> 31:49.995
Okay.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.019
More detailed questions.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.081
In the meantime,

31:54.584 --> 31:57.110
I'll tell you people are holy open.

31:57.170 --> 31:58.173
Yeah, my work's out of here.

31:58.193 --> 32:00.278
You should do it through here.

32:00.298 --> 32:03.605
You might mention that you should talk to me.

32:03.625 --> 32:04.127
Yeah.

32:04.307 --> 32:06.232
Justice, is my computer here today?

32:08.116 --> 32:09.840
No, it's your Monday when it's your birthday.

32:09.860 --> 32:10.361
I haven't seen it at all.

32:10.382 --> 32:10.602
Okay, yeah.

32:11.138 --> 32:15.305
I just came back from there.

32:15.385 --> 32:21.034
I spent almost a month there.

32:23.157 --> 32:33.814
We started getting a lot of requests from Jews and Soviet Union, asking us to go up, staying there, starting schools, starting cultural centers, and looking for the books to read.

32:33.834 --> 32:35.356
So we would respond to this.

32:35.376 --> 32:37.720
We would send them free to charge any books they needed.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.045
I thought it had been cut off for 72 years.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.629
It was illegal to own these books and suddenly had a chance.

32:43.730 --> 32:44.611
We would do what we could.

32:45.292 --> 32:52.561
We went there at the very end of November, spent close to a month traveling around, meeting these people in person.

32:52.581 --> 32:55.225
And what we found was a very disturbing situation, in a way.

32:55.245 --> 32:56.626
It wasn't what we expected.

32:56.646 --> 33:04.556
We kind of had this notion that here was a community poised and ready for some kind of cultural renaissance and that we could bring large numbers of books in.

33:04.576 --> 33:07.420
This would be a million and a half Jews suddenly coming to life together.

33:08.446 --> 33:09.507
Well, that wasn't the case.

33:09.527 --> 33:10.388
There were two factors.

33:10.408 --> 33:12.650
And one is that assimilation is extreme.

33:12.670 --> 33:15.513
After 72 years, several generations are being cut off.

33:16.074 --> 33:19.397
There's very little knowledge left in the community to build upon.

33:19.417 --> 33:23.141
And the other is that anti-Semitism is so extreme that many Jews are getting out of it.

33:23.161 --> 33:27.405
Most Jews were there trying to leave at this point.

33:27.425 --> 33:31.950
So I guess I don't see a huge future there.

33:31.970 --> 33:37.255
On the other hand, particularly in the Baltics, there is some very interesting activity.

33:37.538 --> 33:44.848
In the Baltics that started Jewish schools, teachers who were trained in Yiddish and Hebrew teachers' academies before the war have organized new schools.

33:44.888 --> 33:45.869
They're not Jewish schools.

33:46.089 --> 33:49.694
They're beginning to teach and study, you know, teach young kids.

33:49.835 --> 33:52.057
You're going to have 400 kids that don't even read us, that mean Yiddish.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.921
So in those places, they're desperate for books.

33:55.883 --> 34:05.115
The way in which books are rare there, I mean, it appears to your eyes when the school in Riga just opened its doors in September, they have one Jewish music book, one Yiddish music book,

34:05.433 --> 34:07.315
which they keep wrapped up in special taping.

34:07.336 --> 34:10.980
The music teacher carries her with her wherever she goes, the only book in the school.

34:11.000 --> 34:18.230
And they had no Yiddish textbooks to use to teach kids.

34:18.250 --> 34:22.155
And so one of the teachers put together a book on her own.

34:22.275 --> 34:24.498
She had no Yiddish type, a Hebrew type.

34:24.518 --> 34:27.162
So she hand-wrote part of the book.

34:27.182 --> 34:33.330
And the rest of it, she took all the books that she had and cut them up and pasted them together in like an extortion note and reconstructed a new book.

34:33.800 --> 34:40.208
and they printed it on the press of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Latvia, and that's the textbook period.

34:40.628 --> 34:44.052
So you are making... We're going to bring them books.

34:44.133 --> 34:45.214
It's not a token.

34:45.254 --> 34:46.095
No, no, it's a real thing.

34:46.115 --> 34:47.937
It's not a token thing.

34:47.997 --> 34:48.778
It's a very real thing.

34:48.838 --> 34:50.961
Are you bringing them, or are you donating them?

34:51.762 --> 34:58.390
It's a very real thing, which will make a very real difference to a limited number of people, but it won't change the face of the Jewish community of the Soviet Union.

34:58.410 --> 35:00.012
How many books do you think you've got to play so far?

35:00.032 --> 35:01.073
I think about 8,000 or 9,000.

35:01.863 --> 35:03.085
And we'll bring them ourselves.

35:03.105 --> 35:04.888
You know, to ship them is not reliable.

35:04.908 --> 35:05.529
They don't get delivered.

35:06.350 --> 35:08.173
And so we're actually going to bring the books in.

35:08.593 --> 35:22.916
We'll ship the books as far as Stockholm, load them onto a truck in Stockholm, ship the truck on a boat, bring the truck as far as it is, Palo and Origa, coming to the country that way, and then driving around the street with things.

35:22.936 --> 35:25.440
How do you, Maccabib, is that how you pronounce her name?

35:25.460 --> 35:27.002
The woman I hope you're talking about?

35:27.022 --> 35:27.583
Oh, Maccabib.

35:27.952 --> 35:30.715
M-A-C-C-A-B-I-B.

35:31.536 --> 35:34.479
M-A-C-C-A-B-I-B.

35:34.699 --> 35:38.043
Maccabib. Right.

35:38.063 --> 35:39.024
I'm going to switch sides now. Okay.

35:39.204 --> 35:42.467
Part of the reason we've been successful here is because our focus has been books.

35:46.191 --> 35:51.597
To speak about Yiddish culture, the abstract, to speak about books in particular.

35:52.268 --> 35:57.634
I think many people share that love of books, that love of the written word, which is why this book, your book, will work so well, I think.

35:57.654 --> 35:58.234
I hope so.

36:00.417 --> 36:07.084
You know, I just go back to when Holden Reckman told me that they didn't think it would appeal to a limited number of people.

36:07.124 --> 36:07.665
They don't know.

36:07.685 --> 36:09.306
I mean, they don't know.

36:09.326 --> 36:13.010
We're not talking about a Sunday football game, but there are a lot of people who love books, I mean, who love books.

36:13.651 --> 36:20.959
They love, and collecting has never been more popular than it is now, trying to do this without crushing it.

36:21.749 --> 36:35.284
I have a pretty large library at home, but I've been much less concerned about collecting books because having a million books sitting in a warehouse, one would be a little less enthusiastic about adding to the books.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.426
Now I only buy books that I read at this point.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.508
I was going to say, how about yourself?

36:38.528 --> 36:39.168
What do you read?

36:39.409 --> 36:40.250
I read a great deal.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.352
I tend to read literature.

36:42.392 --> 36:45.175
I almost never read modern novels.

36:45.998 --> 36:49.061
From various literary... Oh, sure.

36:49.081 --> 36:56.027
I mean, I still read Yiddish literature, of course, but I also read a great deal of English and French and a lot of other literatures as well.

36:57.728 --> 37:04.754
Everybody from Zola to...anyway, I mean, all great literature I love, and I can read endlessly.

37:05.174 --> 37:08.277
If I had nothing else to do, I would read for the next three years.

37:08.858 --> 37:13.742
You do go up to Nova Scotia, I understand, a couple of weeks just to... Yeah, summer hustle.

37:13.762 --> 37:15.263
And it just allows you to... Right.

37:16.272 --> 37:20.744
But I imagine this is never far from your mind, though.

37:20.764 --> 37:21.366
Oh, the work?

37:21.386 --> 37:22.047
Yeah.

37:22.448 --> 37:23.832
Checking into the office every two days.

37:23.892 --> 37:24.594
It's a busy place.

37:26.399 --> 37:26.880
Okay.

37:27.281 --> 37:28.124
Good.

37:28.144 --> 37:28.645
I'll be back.
