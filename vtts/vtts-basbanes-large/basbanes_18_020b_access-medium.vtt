WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:04.069
Well, thank you for calling me.

00:04.789 --> 00:04.889
Sure.

00:04.909 --> 00:05.550
I appreciate it.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.171
Sorry I couldn't get into Boston today.

00:08.232 --> 00:12.817
Interesting collection of stories for a first collection, I guess, is one way to start.

00:13.157 --> 00:26.810
Fiction, I have to say, fiction writers, I find the most challenging interviews, but also the most difficult, because generally you like these things to speak for themselves, so we have to talk about other things, I guess.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.532
But in any case...

00:30.203 --> 00:35.210
Tell me a little bit about the inspiration for this collection.

00:35.270 --> 00:45.925
I've read everything about your background as a psychotherapist in Connecticut, and I guess everybody who talks to you wants to reach and find the connection between the two.

00:46.486 --> 00:48.889
Right, and I keep saying no.

00:49.209 --> 00:54.777
Although I can't see, I guess, on a superficial level that your interest in the...

00:55.465 --> 00:58.569
And the subject certainly energizes the fiction, I guess.

00:59.010 --> 01:00.131
Well, my interest in people.

01:00.291 --> 01:00.732
And people.

01:00.872 --> 01:03.636
But I was interested in people before I became a therapist.

01:03.656 --> 01:08.863
And I think even if I was still a waitress, I'd be interested in people.

01:09.123 --> 01:14.450
But we do probe relationships and things here in the... Absolutely.

01:14.470 --> 01:23.582
But again, I just think it's... I became a therapist because I really find people very interesting.

01:23.832 --> 01:49.367
including their relationships and how they get to different points in their lives that's not something that grew out of being a therapist it's just that i hear a lot more about it than i might have if i wasn't a therapist but you know the fact is if you're willing to listen your friends and your family complete strangers will tell you all sorts of things about themselves and their lives and by having such a good ear

01:50.714 --> 02:02.681
But I guess what I'm, certainly nothing that you hear in your office is, though many of the things must be wonderful in terms of.

02:03.062 --> 02:06.971
It's very tempting, but it's really not allowed.

02:08.194 --> 02:09.617
And I take that pretty seriously.

02:09.732 --> 02:10.453
I'm sure.

02:10.473 --> 02:27.504
I did an interview a couple months ago with Ethan Kanin, of course, who's a great young man and a practicing physician, and he said, really, you know, the two don't come together at all as far as he's concerned.

02:27.544 --> 02:29.648
Although, he said...

02:29.982 --> 02:37.720
You really do hear some extraordinary things from people, especially when they're towards the end of their lives, too.

02:39.363 --> 02:43.232
Yeah, he said some amazing things if you just listen.

02:46.115 --> 03:01.456
I guess breaking into to become a writer, I would say one of the most daunting tasks would be the short story, certainly in terms of the commercial aspects of it.

03:02.578 --> 03:06.684
Fortunately, I hadn't given any thought to those things when I was writing.

03:06.804 --> 03:07.144
Really?

03:07.585 --> 03:13.253
No, I mean, I don't live in, like, a writer world, and I didn't have any friends who were writers, and

03:13.722 --> 03:19.532
You know, I was never sort of sitting around over cappuccinos saying, well, which would be the most commercially viable form?

03:19.812 --> 03:22.757
You know, I was just sort of sitting at the kitchen table writing.

03:23.098 --> 03:24.140
You could have picked poetry.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.482
That would have really been the toughest one.

03:25.542 --> 03:27.365
Right, if I really wanted to sink myself.

03:27.385 --> 03:27.585
Yeah.

03:28.307 --> 03:32.153
My poetry is so bad that it seems unlikely that it would ever...

03:32.403 --> 03:57.246
see the light of day and that that will be a good thing now you have been writing for publication for some time i know six is really that's not that's not so long and actually i thought it might have been longer than that when you started did did you think that this was a was this something more that you did to occupy yourself or did you actually actually no i didn't actually find myself with a lot of time on my hands i had a

03:57.226 --> 03:59.410
Full-time job and two small children.

04:01.593 --> 04:06.742
No, I just wanted to try to tell the stories as they were sort of showing up inside my head.

04:07.403 --> 04:09.888
I didn't actually even think of it as writing for a while.

04:11.110 --> 04:11.911
How were you writing these?

04:11.971 --> 04:14.035
Longhand word processor?

04:14.295 --> 04:21.748
Longhand for a while, and then my mother very nicely bought me a little computer for a birthday present, and that was great.

04:22.252 --> 04:29.819
And although I'm sort of a computer moron, I was able to sort of master the word processing act, and that's been terrific.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.241
Do you write on that now?

04:31.561 --> 04:32.021
Yeah.

04:32.041 --> 04:32.562
Primary?

04:32.842 --> 04:33.763
I mean, do you?

04:34.143 --> 04:34.604
I do both.

04:34.764 --> 04:37.787
I write longhand, and I write on the word processor.

04:38.227 --> 04:40.529
It's a remarkable instrument for revision, isn't it?

04:40.890 --> 04:47.056
Well, it encourages, I mean, I find that, although some people feel that it encourages them to be long-winded, I don't find that.

04:47.076 --> 04:48.597
I do find that it encourages me.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.903
to keep changing and making it better.

04:52.585 --> 05:05.203
I did an interview with Robert, I've done just quite a few with Robert B. Parker, and I remember the first couple times, and he had this old stand-up manual typewriter there, you know, and he said, I wouldn't use anything else.

05:06.285 --> 05:13.395
And this last book, which I thought was his best, and I went to do an interview, and here's this state-of-the-art computer over there.

05:13.415 --> 05:14.517
I guess he got over there.

05:14.733 --> 05:15.715
And I said, what happened?

05:15.735 --> 05:18.442
He said, the thing busted and I couldn't find anybody who could fix it.

05:18.462 --> 05:21.950
Of course, manual typewriters, you know, are extinct species.

05:22.992 --> 05:24.776
And so he said he had to get the computer.

05:24.816 --> 05:26.721
But I found, I said, isn't that amazing?

05:26.781 --> 05:32.574
Because I actually found a more polished quality to, I didn't quite say it to him that bluntly, but I did.

05:32.594 --> 05:32.995
That was nice.

05:34.274 --> 05:35.215
But I'm sure it's true.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.358
Well, you know, one is encouraged to polish.

05:37.579 --> 05:39.521
Yeah, and plus there's an ease.

05:39.541 --> 05:46.832
I know when you type something nice and clean, you're really reluctant to throw that piece of paper away and type the whole thing over for one word.

05:46.872 --> 05:52.420
Tell me, I mean, the title is a general title.

05:53.281 --> 05:56.285
There really isn't a title story, per se.

05:56.305 --> 05:56.626
No, there's not.

05:56.646 --> 05:57.907
That's unusual, isn't it?

05:58.889 --> 06:03.235
Well, I mean, I think we had thought for a long time, you know, love is not a pie and other stories and

06:03.687 --> 06:06.451
Then for a while, the title of the collection was Trespasses.

06:06.731 --> 06:15.184
But the guy who was my editor at the time felt, right before the book went to print, he said, oh, I think that's just a little cold.

06:15.244 --> 06:18.208
He said, it just doesn't convey everything.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.251
And so he said, let's find something.

06:20.291 --> 06:27.602
And so the highly scientific approach of publishing companies is your editor runs up and down the halls asking everybody what they think.

06:28.493 --> 06:47.119
And after sort of going through all the titles that sound like bad perfume, you know, obsession, compulsion, blah, blah, blah, and all the ones that sound like 1940s nightclub songs, I said, well, you know, how about come to me?

06:47.200 --> 06:57.454
Because, you know, when people are drawn to the object of their love or their desire, they don't just want to

06:57.991 --> 07:17.130
be in the object's presence they also want to feel that the object is also calling to them beckoning to them what voice do you see uttering those words or do you oh i think it's the voice in the head of lots of the characters it's the voice that they want to hear

07:17.903 --> 07:41.751
the people that they love or are drawn to saying to them and it's words that they may never hear that's what they want to hear and of course it suggests uh it suggests narration doesn't it in every case that there will be a story told yes yeah i think uh and and these voices uh you really i have to say first time out um

07:43.672 --> 07:50.979
you really have a very sure sense of narrative voice here, and they really are distinctively different characters.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.324
Is this something that just came in the process of creating these stories?

07:56.644 --> 07:59.968
Did you see these characters and the voices just kind of emerge?

08:00.168 --> 08:04.232
The stories are very much character-driven, and I think the people were so clear to me.

08:05.453 --> 08:13.020
I could sort of hear their voices, and I think that's one of the reasons that a lot of times I don't use

08:13.557 --> 08:22.391
as much, you know, he said, she said, because I really, in my head, I could hear them so clearly that it seemed, you know, redundant.

08:23.072 --> 08:26.397
You know, I didn't need to say who it was who was speaking because I could tell who was speaking.

08:26.417 --> 08:32.106
I think for the most part that's true for the reader, although perhaps not always.

08:33.470 --> 08:39.077
Now, I think it's five stories in the middle are quite connected.

08:39.358 --> 08:42.041
Do you see all of these connected in a larger sense?

08:42.141 --> 08:45.886
I mean, even though they aren't in a literal sense.

08:45.946 --> 08:50.392
Well, maybe because they're all about people, but as I say, I don't know sort of what else one would write about.

08:53.256 --> 09:02.127
I don't, you know, there's, you know, between the man who is married in Hyacinth and, you know,

09:02.782 --> 09:12.251
you know, the music critic who loses her husband in sleepwalking.

09:12.292 --> 09:32.772
I don't think these people have a relationship between each other or necessarily a great deal in common, but there is certainly, I think, the issues around loneliness and the wish to be known and the wish to be loved, and those things are things that a lot of the characters have in common.

09:33.764 --> 09:36.849
Have you thought about writing a novel?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.553
I'm actually about halfway through a novel.

09:39.714 --> 09:40.114
Oh, really?

09:40.695 --> 09:46.945
So, with any luck, I will get through the other half and hope I'll be finished with it by the winter.

09:47.086 --> 09:47.707
Oh, that's nice.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.870
Is it under contract with HarperCollins?

09:50.331 --> 09:55.399
Well, no, they sort of get first look, and so they will, in fact, get first look in the very near future.

09:56.341 --> 09:56.481
Uh-huh.

09:56.832 --> 09:58.816
and then we'll see what happens with it.

09:58.856 --> 10:02.664
So the book really is not, you don't have a publisher for it just now?

10:03.005 --> 10:03.065
No.

10:03.085 --> 10:04.347
That's the best way, I think.

10:05.209 --> 10:14.588
Yeah, well, it's just sort of, you know, it's my baby now, and I think I'll probably find a home for it before it's done, partially.

10:15.462 --> 10:22.615
You know, because I think that will work out okay, but also I don't feel like I have to make it some way or another for anybody else.

10:23.677 --> 10:31.412
You know, it'll be the book that I write, and it'll be good or it'll be bad, and some people will like it and some people won't, and that'll be that.

10:31.392 --> 10:41.022
Your writing is certainly quite taught here, and I imagine the nature of the form of the story drives that.

10:41.722 --> 10:48.870
Do you find that in working on a novel now that you have a little more freedom to develop and to kind of go out?

10:48.890 --> 10:57.298
Yeah, I am, and I find that I'm sort of trying very hard to sort of make the most of the freedom to expand on stuff, but I keep going back, and

10:57.717 --> 11:00.701
striking out phrases because it's too much and it's too wordy.

11:00.721 --> 11:05.969
So I want to sort of have the development, you know, that you get in a novel, kind of the room.

11:07.371 --> 11:17.326
But I don't want it to be any more verbose in the short stories.

11:18.568 --> 11:22.454
Like the stories, is the novel character-driven?

11:22.594 --> 11:23.656
Oh, yeah.

11:23.836 --> 11:24.938
I mean, it's really true.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.420
It's the only thing I really care about.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.201
So...

11:27.417 --> 11:28.438
You know, it's just people.

11:28.719 --> 11:33.244
Actually, one of the protagonists is a character from the short stories.

11:34.045 --> 11:40.673
There's a little girl in a story called Light Breaks Where No Sunshine, a little girl and her friend, Mr. Klein, the furrier.

11:41.755 --> 11:56.833
And although her name changes in the novel, it's really the same girl, and we follow her sort of growing up, and then there are sort of two other main characters, and their lives are intertwined, and then there's sort of a major disruption.

11:57.404 --> 12:01.408
And then their lives resume again about 15 years later.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.994
Do you strive for some kind of a catharsis in these stories in your writing?

12:07.194 --> 12:08.936
For me or for the character?

12:08.956 --> 12:12.540
Well, for the character, for you, for whatever, for the reader as well.

12:14.862 --> 12:24.913
I think I tend to think of it more, you know, sort of if I have a hope, it's sort of a hope of a certain kind of illumination or of a door opening rather than catharsis.

12:25.720 --> 12:37.555
Because, as you say, the stories are character-driven, and yet the stories themselves are stories.

12:38.096 --> 12:40.819
I hate to sound silly here, but you know what I'm saying.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.223
Yes, I like stories.

12:43.243 --> 12:45.105
I like beginnings, middles, and ends.

12:45.626 --> 12:47.027
And even the title will come to me.

12:47.047 --> 12:51.473
We're going to sit down and we're going to sit around the campfire and talk.

12:53.616 --> 12:53.736
Right.

12:54.728 --> 13:00.633
Again, in terms of relationships, you have a very interesting menage a trois.

13:00.653 --> 13:23.554
You have jealousy with an older man and a younger... I hate to talk again about the stories themselves, but nevertheless, you certainly have come up with some, I wouldn't necessarily say bizarre, but some certainly interesting relationships here that... They're not apparently conventional, but I...

13:23.534 --> 13:24.596
That's the word.

13:24.636 --> 13:28.163
They're not, you know, so uncommon either.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.548
And certainly the feelings are so uncommon.

13:34.817 --> 13:37.542
Do you labor over these stories or do they?

13:37.562 --> 13:38.103
Yes.

13:38.123 --> 13:38.404
Really?

13:40.107 --> 13:41.931
Yeah, I'm a great rewriter.

13:42.097 --> 13:47.082
Again, you say you started these about five or six years ago.

13:48.083 --> 13:48.664
How did that?

13:49.124 --> 13:51.947
I'm just wondering what the spark was that got it going.

13:51.967 --> 13:52.768
I don't really know.

13:52.808 --> 13:55.231
I mean, I really feel like they sort of started showing up.

13:55.892 --> 14:02.178
And I sort of made a decision actually not to become a psychoanalyst, which is sort of what I have been about to do.

14:03.099 --> 14:10.467
And somehow into that space or in that decision,

14:11.797 --> 14:18.672
the story started appearing and I thought, oh well, I guess I'll do this for a while.

14:19.734 --> 14:23.983
And then I thought, oh well, I guess this is what they call writing.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.544
I have to have very impressed.

14:29.068 --> 14:33.398
And I really am pleased to see so many good collections of stories.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.783
Yeah, it is nice.

14:35.803 --> 14:43.761
Maybe it's just coincidental, but I mean, I've agreed to talk to at least half a dozen story writers in the last...

14:43.741 --> 15:05.682
couple months you know it's just uh grace paley is going to be in boston in two weeks and i'm having wonderful and i really i feel like i've been training you know for the olympics or something getting getting ready for this one and uh gee i did a steve dixon uh um last week and of course i gotta find

15:06.337 --> 15:09.284
I have to get all these things published now, too, in the news book.

15:10.046 --> 15:11.871
I'm a great admirer of Grace Paley's works.

15:12.131 --> 15:12.853
She's wonderful.

15:12.893 --> 15:15.459
Actually, I've collected her for a number of years.

15:15.519 --> 15:15.760
Yeah.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.687
It's not always an easy task.

15:19.369 --> 15:21.915
Yeah, I've got all her books, as a matter of fact, so I'm...

15:22.418 --> 15:24.182
Listen, I won't take up too much of your time.

15:25.104 --> 15:26.547
I really appreciate your calling.

15:26.807 --> 15:30.014
Oh, I'm delighted that I could call, and thanks.

15:30.034 --> 15:30.335
Thanks.

15:30.576 --> 15:34.484
And I do write for a number of papers now, I'm pleased to say.

15:34.544 --> 15:37.430
You live where down in... I'm in Connecticut.

15:37.510 --> 15:38.292
In Connecticut.

15:38.513 --> 15:42.220
One paper in Manchester just started taking my call a couple weeks ago.

15:42.802 --> 15:42.942
Uh-huh.

15:43.242 --> 15:47.066
Actually, I've been talking to a paper in Middletown.

15:47.086 --> 15:47.967
Are you near Middletown?

15:48.247 --> 15:49.889
I'm right next door to Middletown.

15:49.909 --> 15:51.371
Yeah, I queried that.

15:51.391 --> 15:54.114
I'm going to shut off my tape record.

15:54.134 --> 15:54.675
There we go.

15:54.855 --> 15:55.355
We're running.

15:56.276 --> 15:57.458
And we're talking to Lynn Nicholas.

15:58.999 --> 16:06.988
Tell me a little bit about how you decided to go after this extraordinary story of the plundered treasures.

16:09.685 --> 16:22.964
in Holland, and my parents completed Germany, and we saw a lot of the bomb cities and everything, and it made such an impression on me, these sort of absolutely flattened city piles of rubble and everything.

16:22.984 --> 16:33.499
And then later on, I started working at the National Gallery of Art, and I began to wonder how possibly any work of art could survive in that kind of scene.

16:34.272 --> 16:39.982
And I sort of majored in history, so I was interested in that period very much.

16:41.285 --> 16:57.293
And then when I was living in Belgium, I read the obituary of someone called Rose Ballon, who was a French curator at the Louvre who stayed there all through the war and was a member of the resistance.

16:57.627 --> 17:00.790
They made a movie about her called The Train.

17:01.651 --> 17:05.976
And I read her obituary, so I thought, well, it'd be interesting to find out what happened.

17:06.016 --> 17:07.958
And then it all kind of came together.

17:08.799 --> 17:22.453
And another thing was that people had been accusing American officers of sort of having a conspiracy to deal with German treasures that were still missing, like the frozen gold.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.965
Which just recently turned up, incidentally, right?

17:25.985 --> 17:28.267
In Russia, of course.

17:28.287 --> 17:31.070
A lot of German curators believed that we had it here in Fort Knox.

17:31.771 --> 17:37.237
And there were some Americans who thought that, too, and were making really very terrible accusations.

17:37.257 --> 17:41.581
So that made me a little bit angry, because I knew a lot of the people.

17:41.762 --> 17:44.064
So I thought I'd just find out the true story.

17:44.905 --> 17:46.466
So 10 years later, there it is.

17:46.487 --> 17:47.067
Fascinating.

17:47.808 --> 17:50.511
There was a case in Texas about a year and a half ago?

17:50.671 --> 17:51.732
Yes, in Quedlinburg.

17:51.897 --> 17:55.166
Right, where in fact an American did take some of that stuff back.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.389
Yes, indeed.

17:56.409 --> 18:06.497
I mean, a lot of American military men did take things, but it was certainly not a government conspiracy on our part or our policy to do that, and that was the difference.

18:06.933 --> 18:09.918
I don't think you can have a war without people taking things.

18:09.938 --> 18:19.833
Yeah, I think what is so eye-opening for me is it's not just the plundering of precious things, because that's gone on historically.

18:19.893 --> 18:21.015
I mean, that's gone on forever.

18:21.616 --> 18:31.010
But the systematic program, and not just of theft, but of purging things that were offensive or that were not within the party line.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.155
It seems that you've gotten into the larger picture as well here.

18:34.439 --> 18:42.908
Yes, well, I mean, that to me was the most shocking thing, because I spent most of those years reading German records, which are at the National Archives.

18:42.928 --> 18:49.114
We have an extraordinary collection there, which was gathered for the Nuremberg trials, basically.

18:49.134 --> 18:55.841
And, I mean, you just can't believe the mentality and their ability to rationalize things that they did.

18:55.861 --> 19:02.067
They, in fact, had a whole structure of laws and rules, which justified...

19:02.468 --> 19:32.087
everything they did to themselves and it was very much based on their racial policies and theories they took things from jews and whatnot but they left in the west anyway the national collections were left intact of course hitler never thought he was going to lose so those would have belonged to him too and he certainly planned to rearrange things particularly take germanic things work by german artists and whatnot back to

19:32.624 --> 19:42.797
Germany, you know, for the German people, and then, you know, rearrange some of the other things.

19:42.817 --> 19:54.492
But what they felt they could just take without any, you know, for themselves, more personally, were the Jewish things, because the Jews were considered stateless.

19:54.512 --> 19:59.678
Did you have any idea of the scope of the pillage when you started?

20:00.012 --> 20:00.773
No, I didn't.

20:00.793 --> 20:07.444
I mean, I think, like most people, people said, oh, the Germans took everything, but I had no idea what that meant, that it was literally in the millions.

20:08.646 --> 20:21.066
But I have to say, when you say in the millions, it's not just pictures, it's statues, coins, armor, books, you know, just furniture, I mean, every conceivable thing that they took.

20:22.728 --> 20:25.032
And again, it was so systematic, too.

20:25.092 --> 20:27.015
It wasn't...

20:27.282 --> 20:50.893
they kept absolutely perfect records in the same way i'm sure you see schindler's list that they made those lists of people and carefully wrote down what they died of or invented things they put down every work of art that they took they said who they'd taken it from what date you know where where it was stored and so those records were very helpful in returning things to people later

20:51.380 --> 20:57.012
Obviously, then, there was a massive archival material for you to sift through.

20:58.335 --> 20:58.736
Yes, indeed.

20:58.756 --> 21:05.229
But tell me about getting a narrative out of this, getting a story out of it, because it's quite an exciting story, too.

21:06.352 --> 21:11.262
Well, the story, what I did sometimes was I would sort of...

21:11.242 --> 21:12.564
expect there was a story there.

21:12.584 --> 21:17.970
And then I would just put the things from all different countries in chronological order.

21:18.110 --> 21:24.037
And then all of a sudden, you would begin to see the relationships of who was doing what at the same time.

21:24.137 --> 21:33.027
I think people have written books about this, but each one was about his own role or his own country.

21:33.348 --> 21:39.595
And what was interesting to me was what was happening simultaneously and the thinking going on.

21:40.199 --> 21:45.344
at different places and how people gradually came to realize what the other ones were doing.

21:46.846 --> 21:50.289
Propaganda was very important for this whole thing.

21:50.390 --> 22:08.248
If the Germans hadn't had such strong propaganda about us, our military probably would never have made as big an effort as they did to recover things, because the Germans were constantly saying that when the Americans came, they were going to take all the art and sell it, you know, and strip Europe bare.

22:08.836 --> 22:16.951
When did you effectively conclude your research on the subject, or did you just keep working on it right up until the time they closed the book?

22:17.412 --> 22:25.967
Well, I think I mostly finished it about two years ago, and then I was just doing the editing.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.788
writing the book.

22:27.808 --> 22:31.873
Did the collapse of the Soviet Union have any ramifications for this?

22:31.933 --> 22:38.082
I mean, in terms of... Well, it confirmed things that I had, you know, I already believed and knew.

22:38.142 --> 22:44.290
I mean, it just, because I was positive that things like the Trojan gold were, had gone to the Soviet Union.

22:44.350 --> 22:45.812
It was the only thing that made any sense.

22:46.366 --> 22:50.534
and then it wasn't confirmed, so that was wonderful.

22:50.554 --> 23:08.830
I'm sure there will be some interesting stories about what happened to them while they were there, but by then it was sort of too late, and it's hard to get into the Russian archives, and I don't read or speak Russian, so I decided to say that they were there and not try to keep it.

23:08.945 --> 23:12.349
At least you were able to document where it is.

23:12.890 --> 23:16.194
I mean, that particular mystery has been solved.

23:16.595 --> 23:17.236
Right.

23:17.376 --> 23:21.361
That's been in the... Those are just press stories that I depended on for that.

23:21.501 --> 23:21.781
Right.

23:21.861 --> 23:23.924
But, you know, I'm sure that's true.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.367
What is the disposition of this stuff?

23:26.467 --> 23:27.449
Is it still uncertain?

23:28.370 --> 23:29.471
It's still uncertain.

23:29.551 --> 23:37.281
I think a lot of people think that the Russians are going to make the Germans pay to get it back, and that would surprise me because...

23:37.801 --> 23:43.150
The Germans did tremendous damage there, and I think that wouldn't be unjustified.

23:44.211 --> 23:46.735
And they're going to get some political mileage out of it, too.

23:48.358 --> 24:00.197
The new trend is to give everything back, like the Elgin marbles from England back to the East, and so there's some talk that the Trojan stuff would go back to Turkey.

24:01.477 --> 24:03.060
Well, at which point I should go back to that.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.562
I'm of Greek heritage, you know.

24:04.603 --> 24:06.165
Maybe the Greeks deserve it, too.

24:06.266 --> 24:07.668
I mean, it's not exactly Turkish.

24:08.389 --> 24:11.435
I mean, if you want to keep going back... Right, well, I don't know if we'd start on that.

24:11.455 --> 24:14.019
There's no end to it, so I'm a little against that.

24:14.360 --> 24:14.560
Yeah.

24:15.903 --> 24:18.928
I mean, the Elgin Marbles...

24:19.634 --> 24:33.210
I know, and one coincidence, a couple years ago, I happened to have been going through the British Museum and appreciated them one day, and then the next day I was on the Acropolis, you know.

24:34.031 --> 24:42.661
And the pollution that has just so savaged the marble there, maybe they're better off where they are, you know.

24:42.721 --> 24:48.647
Well, I think they have built now, they're building a new museum over on the Parthenon, on the Acropolis.

24:49.028 --> 24:49.168
Uh-huh.

24:49.537 --> 24:53.263
I don't know how that would work out.

24:53.783 --> 24:58.891
Some people say they don't like the way they're displayed in the British Museum, but I think they look pretty good.

24:58.911 --> 25:00.253
I think it's pretty nice, actually.

25:01.155 --> 25:02.056
It's spectacular.

25:02.076 --> 25:06.202
I mean, they do follow the contours, and you can follow the narrative.

25:06.222 --> 25:07.805
They get very close.

25:07.825 --> 25:08.386
Very nice.

25:09.127 --> 25:15.637
The Egyptians apparently also want Nefertiti, which was one of the things recovered by our forces.

25:17.019 --> 25:17.940
It would go on and on.

25:18.359 --> 25:25.746
Obviously, it's a great story, and you do have a background, a curatorial background, I guess.

25:26.127 --> 25:28.849
You've worked in Washington.

25:29.810 --> 25:29.910
Yeah.

25:31.392 --> 25:37.778
Is this a story that appealed to you as an art story or as a detective story or as a crime story or all of the above?

25:37.798 --> 25:46.206
I think it appealed to me almost more as a morality play and just...

25:46.658 --> 25:54.186
human nature story, but, you know, in the end, it sort of symbolized everything that had gone on at that time.

25:54.226 --> 26:04.097
So, I mean, I think the treasure hunt aspects and everything are fascinating and interesting.

26:04.117 --> 26:15.349
I mean, just the danger in which all of these works of art were put over and over again just, you know, you just can't believe that they survived, but sort of overall things

26:15.802 --> 26:28.620
It may sound very idealistic, but it is an affirmation of our system and that it really turned out for the best it can.

26:28.640 --> 26:34.748
Particularly because our people who helped recover it had to persuade our government to do that.

26:34.768 --> 26:39.615
I mean, our military weren't, you know, they said, we don't care about that.

26:39.655 --> 26:44.762
They put out a tremendous effort to get this done.

26:45.485 --> 26:52.094
Let me just interject my own interest in theft, particularly in terms of book theft.

26:53.176 --> 26:57.883
I recently finished writing a book about bibliomania, of all things.

26:58.804 --> 26:59.125
Oh, what fun.

26:59.145 --> 27:00.066
I'd love to see that.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.349
And it'll be published early next year by Henry Holt.

27:03.591 --> 27:11.202
And in fact, on Tuesday, I'm giving a Forzheimer lecture at the New York Public Library on book theft, on Stephen Blumberg.

27:11.662 --> 27:14.867
You know the fellow who stole the thousands of books from all the...

27:14.847 --> 27:21.040
And I had attended his trial out in Iowa three years ago and interviewed him.

27:21.101 --> 27:25.310
So it is a matter of some considerable interest to me.

27:25.630 --> 27:33.227
And when I saw your book, of course, we have theft on the one hand, which is cultural felony.

27:33.207 --> 27:44.758
But on the other, we also have, I have an old book, which I picked up at a secondhand bookstore, about the destruction of art and architecture, you know, by bombs and by marauding armies and stuff.

27:45.078 --> 27:49.723
So there are two different considerations here, aren't they?

27:49.783 --> 28:01.694
But, you know, war, there's always been looting and destruction in war, but this was so different, I mean, because of the Nazis, the way they planned it and carried it out, and they're theorizing about it.

28:02.095 --> 28:02.235
Mm-hmm.

28:02.722 --> 28:14.194
I do have not just Quedlinburg, but there are a number of other cases of people running off with things, you know, the Hess Jewels.

28:15.575 --> 28:21.981
And the interesting thing was that the Nazis' own greed would occasionally overcome even their rules.

28:23.063 --> 28:30.450
They had all these rules for themselves, and sometimes they couldn't stand it, so then they'd steal something like the Bruges Madonna.

28:31.578 --> 28:40.829
Are there any great masterpieces still unaccounted for that you can... Yes, I think they're mostly German or German-owned.

28:41.029 --> 28:49.759
And there's one, a Raphael from Poland, which never turned up, which is of the caliber of Leonardo's, you know, the lady with the ermine, which was recovered.

28:51.180 --> 28:52.722
There's a Raphael portrait there.

28:54.324 --> 28:56.887
From Berlin, there's quite a lot of stuff.

28:56.907 --> 29:01.332
There were about 400 paintings that were in a flak tower that supposedly burned up.

29:02.138 --> 29:11.068
And then there's the Bellini and a wonderful Chiarelli called Han, which is very famous.

29:11.088 --> 29:11.869
What do you suppose?

29:11.889 --> 29:13.410
They're in private collections somewhere?

29:13.630 --> 29:20.178
I mean, maybe they really did burn up, but a lot of people like to think that they didn't and that somebody took them.

29:20.238 --> 29:27.646
But I mean, are there any suggestions that there were things thought to have been stolen as opposed to being destroyed?

29:28.246 --> 29:31.690
Yeah, well, of course, the Amber Room, I suppose, is the

29:31.973 --> 29:33.876
the main one.

29:33.896 --> 29:36.100
But I think that's probably at the bottom of the Baltic.

29:37.182 --> 29:42.612
I think most of the things that are missing were probably private collections.

29:42.632 --> 29:48.262
And they do, every now and then, one will show up on the market.

29:49.204 --> 29:55.956
In the book, I talk about a drawing, I mean, a pastel, a Degas portrait that

29:56.290 --> 30:04.001
It was owned by Paul Rosenberg, and it was advertised in an art magazine with the provenance blatantly.

30:04.181 --> 30:12.893
And when they called Interpol and got everybody going on this, and by the time they got there, they'd taken it out of the sale and hidden it again.

30:13.834 --> 30:15.396
It's amazing.

30:16.979 --> 30:23.306
I mean, kind of vague provenance.

30:27.792 --> 30:39.966
Provenance is one of the ways I started getting ideas about this book because a lot of pictures, particularly, you'll notice that they give

30:40.098 --> 30:48.968
very detailed provenance up to about 1937, and then it starts again in 1953 or four, and there's this odd blank in the middle.

30:50.110 --> 30:55.916
And those, of course, where they were was when Nazis had them.

30:55.936 --> 31:07.590
Or they sold a lot of things off on the market, and there was a famous collector of Switzerland, Emil Buehler, who quite knowingly bought these things.

31:08.009 --> 31:10.732
And then he was quite complicated.

31:10.752 --> 31:13.134
He finally gave them back, and then he bought them again.

31:13.835 --> 31:15.797
And he said that that was what he was going to do.

31:16.998 --> 31:27.930
But it took a little pressure to make him... Do you think he was that magnanimous, or are you a little... He didn't... The Swiss courts, you know... He was forced.

31:28.731 --> 31:32.214
Yeah, he judged against it, so... But things happen.

31:32.274 --> 31:37.780
You remember the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston had this wonderful Egyptian thing...

31:38.266 --> 31:43.752
Which came from a... I think it wasn't a rap deal that they smuggled out of Italy.

31:45.494 --> 31:46.335
That was bad.

31:46.355 --> 31:49.718
Yeah, I mean, theft is a great concern.

31:49.838 --> 32:05.235
I mean, it's not just... It's not just these... There are, to me, there, at the State Department and the Disformation Agency, and I'm trying to do international laws for these things, but...

32:05.688 --> 32:13.537
I mean, if you've been writing books about book theft, if someone wants something badly enough, nothing is going to stop them.

32:13.557 --> 32:14.678
Nothing is going to stop them.

32:14.798 --> 32:28.594
I mean, I had an FBI agent tell me, he said they could take these books, they could dig a pit 50 feet deep for reinforced concrete in there and not allow anybody in there.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.256
And he said, that might keep this guy out.

32:30.276 --> 32:31.577
He said, but I wouldn't bet on it.

32:33.245 --> 32:34.607
Yeah.

32:34.647 --> 32:39.394
Did you run into any much book theft in your investigations at all?

32:39.454 --> 32:40.796
They took millions of books.

32:41.937 --> 32:57.379
And that's a very interesting thing, too, that Alfred Rosenberg, who was sort of theorist, ideological theorist of the party, was going to start an anti-Semitic think tank called the Hochschule.

32:57.916 --> 33:09.994
And they took a lot of things from synagogues and whatnot, and they were going to put these all in this place so that later generations of Nazis could study what was bad about Judaism, I guess.

33:10.014 --> 33:10.335
Really?

33:10.555 --> 33:23.755
They saved all the Torahs and religious objects and millions of Jewish books from synagogues, both in the eastern countries and the west.

33:24.511 --> 33:29.476
And those were all gathered together in a collecting point after the war at Offenbach.

33:30.237 --> 33:38.445
And rather heroic, there was a man called Seymour Pomerantz who had worked with the National Archive to organize the return.

33:39.666 --> 33:42.129
And they had a deadline.

33:42.149 --> 33:46.013
They had to do it before our occupation troops withdrew.

33:46.593 --> 33:47.734
So they offered terrible pressure.

33:49.656 --> 33:52.459
And they managed to get millions of things back.

33:53.418 --> 33:58.827
But if you're interested in books, that's a very fascinating episode.

33:58.847 --> 33:59.689
You have to forgive me.

33:59.789 --> 34:01.672
I just got my review copy yesterday.

34:01.712 --> 34:04.857
Oh, isn't it exciting?

34:04.917 --> 34:05.919
It's the most exciting.

34:05.999 --> 34:07.802
Is this your first book?

34:07.822 --> 34:08.103
Yes.

34:08.163 --> 34:10.667
No, I mean, the review copy of your book I got yesterday.

34:10.687 --> 34:16.457
And what I'm saying is I haven't had the opportunity to read it through.

34:16.497 --> 34:17.198
Oh, no.

34:18.443 --> 34:21.267
But I kind of wish they'd gotten it to me a little earlier.

34:21.487 --> 34:22.749
No, this is my first book.

34:23.310 --> 34:26.033
In fact, we just sold it three weeks ago.

34:26.874 --> 34:31.681
It's a little early yet to be getting corrected proofs.

34:31.861 --> 34:37.649
I don't go into the book thing terribly deeply because I had to cut a lot out of my book.

34:37.769 --> 34:43.237
Well, that stuff that you just spoke about, is that in the book?

34:43.317 --> 34:44.198
Yes, a little bit.

34:45.072 --> 34:46.053
Okay.

34:46.073 --> 34:47.255
Did they destroy books?

34:47.375 --> 35:01.896
I mean, were they collecting to justify a certain kind of... In the eastern countries, the Slavic countries, they put... I mean, Slavs were put in the same category as Jews.

35:01.916 --> 35:14.995
So they took... They emptied the libraries in Poland and Russia and just helped a lot of the things that were in Polish and Russian because they were going to make...

35:15.295 --> 35:21.041
those people into sort of agricultural slaves and destroy their culture.

35:22.422 --> 35:25.766
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

35:26.186 --> 35:27.027
It's beyond belief.

35:27.047 --> 35:31.852
And then they would allow them just a few little things to have in their libraries.

35:32.793 --> 35:43.024
But the German intellectuals who were interested in Eastern European studies managed to, went through all kinds of machinations to preserve

35:43.358 --> 35:52.269
periodicals and things that they wanted for their, you know, their university libraries that they didn't have, or, you know, research papers and things.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.193
They used those quite freely.

35:57.535 --> 35:58.417
How about rarities?

35:58.457 --> 36:08.149
Did they, and when we talk about libraries, of course, we talk about everything in the stacks, but also there are the special collections, manuscripts.

36:08.349 --> 36:10.952
They kept those, and

36:11.185 --> 36:20.338
I don't know if they sold those in the East or not, or whether they just kept them, and the German universities kind of fought over them.

36:20.358 --> 36:26.447
But certainly in the West, they got rid of their degenerate thing.

36:27.588 --> 36:38.003
They took them out of Germany, but they also sold them to people in the United States, particularly, or dealers who were going to take them there because they knew they could make money on it.

36:39.940 --> 36:43.704
It was much more than an assault on humanity then, wasn't it?

36:44.005 --> 36:46.668
It was an assault on the intellect, on culture.

36:47.288 --> 36:55.578
Yes, I mean, it just, and I thought, well, by the end, I've got to understand this mentality, but I really, I don't.

36:55.598 --> 36:58.181
I mean, there's no justification for it at all.

36:59.222 --> 37:00.463
It's quite an exciting project.

37:00.743 --> 37:01.785
It took you, what, 10 years?

37:01.805 --> 37:08.412
10 years, and I mean, I wasn't working absolutely flat out all 10 years, but the last five, certainly, I

37:08.763 --> 37:11.066
How long had it been under contract?

37:13.008 --> 37:13.288
Let's see.

37:14.409 --> 37:16.912
I think I got the contract in 92.

37:16.932 --> 37:17.373
Oh, really?

37:17.433 --> 37:23.500
So for really most of this, you were doing it basically, as we say, on spec.

37:24.401 --> 37:25.242
Yeah, we'll ignore that.

37:25.742 --> 37:27.364
Okay.

37:27.564 --> 37:35.233
Yes, well, I started out, and since I'd never written a book or anything, I didn't know what it processed for.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.015
Do you want to take that?

37:37.315 --> 37:40.097
No, that's okay.

37:42.059 --> 37:42.600
Okay.

37:42.620 --> 37:54.049
But I was working at the National Gallery with a man called Craig Smythe, who had been an officer in the American Army who ran the collecting point where they brought all the things they found.

37:55.190 --> 38:00.915
And he was later head of the Art Institute at New York University and head of UTATI, a very distinguished man.

38:01.956 --> 38:06.580
And he was writing a lecture on what he had done, and so that really made me

38:06.931 --> 38:09.795
He said, well, stop doing research and start writing.

38:09.815 --> 38:10.396
That's right.

38:10.416 --> 38:17.006
And I did, and I was just very lucky that Knopf was interested.

38:17.026 --> 38:17.467
I love it.

38:17.507 --> 38:20.993
To me, it's a fascinating book.

38:21.013 --> 38:29.285
Of course, I do have a particular interest in the subject, but I'm delighted that Knopf saw the wisdom in publishing it, too.

38:29.465 --> 38:33.732
Well, I certainly had a very fascinating time doing this, and...

38:34.353 --> 38:40.182
The people I've met who were, many of them still alive, I interviewed a lot of them, are just a fantastic group.

38:41.684 --> 38:45.190
Again, when did you start the actual writing?

38:45.911 --> 38:46.832
Sorry?

38:46.852 --> 38:48.094
When did you start the actual writing?

38:49.777 --> 38:53.222
I would say about 90, about.

38:53.502 --> 38:53.803
Really?

38:54.864 --> 38:56.547
And was it intimidating at all?

38:56.915 --> 38:58.457
Was it intimidating at all?

38:58.537 --> 39:00.219
I mean, you must have had a mess of information.

39:00.259 --> 39:05.907
It's hard to get started, but once I did get started, I found it not difficult.

39:06.527 --> 39:07.909
I had a lot of training in writing.

39:07.949 --> 39:16.280
I went to Oxford, and what you do there is you write three or four essays a week, and you never have time to revise them.

39:16.300 --> 39:19.524
So I've gotten quite good at that, and it's like riding a bicycle.

39:19.544 --> 39:20.405
It hadn't gone away.

39:20.445 --> 39:21.066
Sure.

39:21.502 --> 39:24.489
I like the beginning with that sale, too.

39:24.509 --> 39:25.912
That seems appropriate.

39:25.932 --> 39:27.275
Oh, good, yes.

39:27.295 --> 39:31.846
That was fun to do that, because I interviewed Mrs. Feilkenfeld, who's been there for a couple of days.

39:32.868 --> 39:39.223
And she knew, she's a dealer still in Switzerland, a very well-known dealer, her son Walter.

39:39.895 --> 39:43.763
And she remembered exactly who, what, what, and where everything was today.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.145
So that was really remarkable.

39:45.927 --> 39:49.073
Now, you're speaking at the Athenaeum today, is that correct?

39:49.093 --> 39:49.574
Tonight, yes.

39:49.734 --> 39:49.915
Tonight.

39:50.295 --> 39:51.137
Now, this is a lecture?

39:51.618 --> 39:53.081
Yes, at 6 o'clock.

39:53.562 --> 39:56.427
Just out of curiosity now, I mean, do you have slides?

39:56.447 --> 39:58.832
I have lots of slides, yes.

39:58.812 --> 40:00.516
Yes.

40:00.536 --> 40:04.606
And you generally cover, I guess you parallel what you do in the book.

40:04.686 --> 40:09.157
Sort of give an outline of the book and show as many slides as I can.

40:09.177 --> 40:09.277
Yeah.

40:09.298 --> 40:11.944
Because they are remarkable pictures.

40:11.964 --> 40:14.290
And the people seem to love them.

40:14.310 --> 40:15.673
Do you work from a script?

40:15.890 --> 40:21.619
Yes, I'm not, maybe someday I'll be able to get up there and talk without it, but not yet.

40:21.779 --> 40:22.901
This is just a personal question.

40:22.921 --> 40:32.435
I'm giving mine next week, and I have my script here, and I'm trying to decide whether or not I'm going to go up and wing it off cards or read the script.

40:32.535 --> 40:44.293
I just read the script, and I find if I lose my place, it's not good, but maybe in a while I'll be able to give, but I write sort of short paragraphs.

40:44.965 --> 40:49.632
And the slides help a lot because, you know, you can stop.

40:49.652 --> 40:50.933
All the slides are great.

40:50.953 --> 40:53.317
Do you have slides?

40:53.337 --> 40:53.837
I'm sorry?

40:53.857 --> 40:55.179
Do you have slides?

40:55.239 --> 41:00.246
I have some photographs that I took of this guy, but I'm not going to do slides.

41:00.326 --> 41:07.156
It's a huge room at the New York Public Library, and it's more complicated than it needs to be.

41:07.176 --> 41:08.898
So I'm not going to.

41:08.918 --> 41:13.605
It was a tremendous amount of work getting the slides coordinated with the same thing.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.151
but it's worth it.

41:15.811 --> 41:18.615
I mean, if I had enough stuff to do it with, I'd do it.

41:19.396 --> 41:20.437
Yeah.

41:20.717 --> 41:23.320
I use pictures of the works of art I'm talking about.

41:23.981 --> 41:30.409
Yeah, well, and this is visual, too, where this is books and a guy, you know, a thief.

41:31.370 --> 41:36.536
Well, listen, I've taken up a half an hour of your time, and I certainly appreciate it.

41:36.556 --> 41:37.277
I've enjoyed it.

41:37.617 --> 41:42.343
But tell me, I didn't quite get the spelling of your name because I want to look for your book.
