00:02.292 --> 00:06.819
Anyway, congratulations on this wonderful book.

00:07.119 --> 00:15.712
I have to tell you, I haven't had it long enough, but I do want to get this in, you know, it won't be in this week, it'll be in the week following.

00:16.573 --> 00:22.421
But certainly what I read so far, it does seem to me that we have a bookend to Mosquito Coast.

00:23.263 --> 00:24.184
That was the idea.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.666
That was the idea.

00:25.706 --> 00:27.709
You know, when I wrote to Mosquito Coast,

00:28.634 --> 00:30.777
I thought that I was writing this book.

00:30.817 --> 00:32.619
I thought I was writing a book about a preacher.

00:32.719 --> 00:37.745
And then it turned out that Ali Fox was only a preacher in a very general sense.

00:37.765 --> 00:41.169
I thought he was going to be quoting the Bible all the time.

00:41.189 --> 00:41.789
He really did.

00:42.570 --> 00:45.734
And it turned out that he does occasionally.

00:46.175 --> 00:48.197
He sort of knows it, but he's kind of rejected it.

00:50.720 --> 00:57.628
So Milroy is a kind of born-again Ali Fox, as you might have gathered.

00:58.402 --> 01:03.347
The tone is certainly more affirmative, I guess.

01:04.188 --> 01:07.351
Is that a fair reading, more positive, more upbeat?

01:07.371 --> 01:08.552
I think that's true.

01:08.712 --> 01:09.653
I think that is true.

01:10.774 --> 01:15.239
It certainly, it's not rejecting the state.

01:15.259 --> 01:19.563
Ali Fox rejects, oh, he's a scientist.

01:19.703 --> 01:22.086
He's full of Yankee ingenuity.

01:22.106 --> 01:23.047
He rejected America.

01:23.087 --> 01:26.350
That's very much the prevailing...

01:26.532 --> 01:31.279
mood of the late seventies was, um, this was a great country once.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.762
It isn't anymore.

01:32.782 --> 01:34.684
Uh, the Arabs are cutting off the oil.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.290
Uh, we're going to have to think of something else.

01:38.310 --> 01:41.034
Why not go somewhere else and start all over again?

01:41.595 --> 01:49.026
Whereas Milwares is, we've proven, time has proven us to have done the right thing.

01:49.788 --> 01:54.615
Where, um, the things that are wrong can be

01:55.608 --> 01:57.530
I'm sorry, the things in Iran came what?

01:57.550 --> 01:58.911
They can be fixed.

01:59.091 --> 02:00.933
We can revitalize this country.

02:01.473 --> 02:12.363
So all this country needs is to eat better, get regular, get more vitamins, live longer, and care a little bit more.

02:13.845 --> 02:20.391
I heard a very good expression in the past few days.

02:20.411 --> 02:21.572
The man was talking about food.

02:21.632 --> 02:22.813
He was a British guy.

02:22.996 --> 02:25.039
And he's saying, people don't eat meals anymore.

02:25.060 --> 02:27.163
They graze all day.

02:27.183 --> 02:27.864
They graze all day.

02:27.924 --> 02:31.731
I wish I had heard that, you know, a year and a half ago.

02:31.751 --> 02:32.652
I would have used that.

02:32.873 --> 02:35.016
Where would you have used that to affect us?

02:35.036 --> 02:41.848
Well, Bill Roy would have said, we've got, mealtime is a big thing because meals are,

02:49.135 --> 02:57.811
There is a kind of transformation that takes place where people sit down together, and when they get up, they are more of one mind.

02:58.392 --> 03:01.318
It's a good family thing, whether they are related or not.

03:01.939 --> 03:09.152
And people who graze, we can't have any more grazing, no more grazing, just heaven.

03:12.338 --> 03:20.847
But the idea of just people snacking all day and eating, it doesn't bond you to anything and it doesn't make you healthy either.

03:20.945 --> 03:36.566
Now, these are buzzwords, of course, bonding, but when did you hit on this idea of nutrition as a mission, the Johnny Appleseed of nutrition, so to speak?

03:36.826 --> 03:41.573
Well, since Mosquito Coast, because Ali talks about that, if you recall.

03:42.935 --> 03:43.836
Look at her over there.

03:43.876 --> 03:47.020
She's full of cheeseburgers.

03:47.521 --> 03:49.804
There's another cheeseburger.

03:50.290 --> 03:56.836
The idea is also in Half Moon Street where the woman there is a food nut.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.699
Chicago Loop is a food nut.

03:59.719 --> 04:14.552
I think so for the past 10 years since I started getting interested in it I've started to put it in these books and I think that's obviously the origin of it.

04:15.353 --> 04:19.437
What things that I care about I just write about and whether it's

04:20.193 --> 04:23.056
paddling a kayak or eating.

04:23.217 --> 04:29.924
Well, I read someplace that I'm not so sure about the voices, but the characters are manifestations of yourself.

04:29.944 --> 04:31.967
Is that a fair reading of someplace?

04:31.987 --> 04:32.527
I think so, yeah.

04:32.728 --> 04:33.168
I think so.

04:33.188 --> 04:37.513
I mean, I can't say, oh, this isn't a satire where I'm completely outside it.

04:37.613 --> 04:42.319
I actually think that I'm part of this whole thing.

04:42.379 --> 04:45.002
And one thing,

04:45.488 --> 04:46.690
I eat this kind of food.

04:46.710 --> 04:53.340
I mean, I've always... This sort of high-fiber vegetarian diet.

04:54.281 --> 04:56.504
I was doing it a bit more when I was writing the book.

04:57.005 --> 05:03.134
But I think probably since I... I gave up smoking in 81.

05:03.975 --> 05:09.163
And since then, I got interested in alternative things.

05:09.183 --> 05:12.087
When you give up smoking, do you smoke, or did you...

05:12.134 --> 05:16.961
I smoked cigars for 20 years and gave them up about six or seven years ago.

05:17.061 --> 05:21.408
But you know how you have to... That's a pretty good example because you've got to replace it with something.

05:22.810 --> 05:22.910
Yeah.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.212
The day is a bit longer.

05:24.232 --> 05:27.417
If you smoke, it absorbs time.

05:27.517 --> 05:31.042
It got to the point where I was getting in the car in the morning and I couldn't wait to get in.

05:31.082 --> 05:33.806
And of course, you know, we're running dogs now.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.208
I mean, you can't smoke anywhere.

05:35.408 --> 05:36.670
Oh, it's terrible.

05:37.171 --> 05:37.872
The...

05:37.852 --> 05:43.719
So I couldn't wait to get in the car, and I said, Jesus, this is what I'm coming to.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.243
I can't wait to get out there and light this thing up.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.384
You can't smoke at home.

05:48.444 --> 05:49.386
You can't smoke here.

05:50.307 --> 05:53.470
And, of course, my wife's happier.

05:53.490 --> 05:54.912
I don't stink like I used to.

05:55.012 --> 06:04.043
It's hard on other people, but you could also, because you can't explain to people how pleasant smoking is to the person who's doing it.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.985
It sounds...

06:06.370 --> 06:09.015
It smells awful to other people.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.262
But I loved the good, I mean, I smoked very nice cigars, I have to say.

06:12.342 --> 06:17.412
I mean, I never smoked a cheap cigar, and I really did savor them, I have to say.

06:18.814 --> 06:25.107
You certainly continue to be concerned with obsession and the obsessive nature of people.

06:25.127 --> 06:28.834
Is that right, or is that just...

06:29.337 --> 06:30.579
Yes.

06:30.719 --> 06:39.410
I think that probably there's a particular type of person that appeals to me, and that's... It's versions of the writer.

06:39.690 --> 06:51.365
It's inventors, like Ali Fox, or preachers, teachers, priestly types, magicians, all of that.

06:51.885 --> 06:56.692
They all sort of strike me as being versions of writers.

06:56.932 --> 06:57.893
They're people...

06:58.463 --> 07:03.469
where the message is that they're changing one thing into another.

07:03.529 --> 07:05.812
They demand attention.

07:05.872 --> 07:07.715
They're addressing the multitude.

07:07.815 --> 07:12.120
Everything that writers do, except they don't pick up a pen.

07:12.501 --> 07:19.510
Writing about writers is pretty unrewarding because no one wants to hear it.

07:19.550 --> 07:22.193
No one wants to read those books.

07:22.898 --> 07:30.307
Chris, you know, one of Shakespeare's favorite images of the writer is the magician, which you use in this book.

07:31.108 --> 07:31.488
What is that?

07:31.628 --> 07:38.457
Well, Prospero, I think, comes closest to being Shakespeare's, you know, signature character.

07:38.517 --> 07:39.298
He's a magician.

07:39.318 --> 07:43.503
I think the magician can also be a writer.

07:43.923 --> 07:44.444
Very much so.

07:44.484 --> 07:49.530
I mean, Thomas Mann called himself, and his family called him, the magician.

07:49.730 --> 07:54.078
He used to sign his name Z for Zalbara.

07:54.479 --> 07:55.160
Really?

07:55.180 --> 07:58.947
Yeah, and they called him the magician.

08:00.069 --> 08:01.672
And he called himself a magician.

08:01.712 --> 08:07.562
And the Magic Mountain and Mario and the magician were all, he was, yeah, obsessed with it.

08:07.823 --> 08:09.466
I won't say obsessed, but interested in it.

08:09.486 --> 08:10.107
Interested.

08:10.127 --> 08:11.670
He saw himself in that mold.

08:11.790 --> 08:11.890
Yeah.

08:12.460 --> 08:17.210
No, I read the PW interview, which says nothing about the book.

08:17.270 --> 08:21.439
I mean, it's a very good biographical interview, but it says nothing about this new book.

08:22.241 --> 08:23.704
Have you read the PW interview yet?

08:24.506 --> 08:25.508
One of the publishers weekly?

08:26.851 --> 08:28.013
With who?

08:28.154 --> 08:29.777
Sam Staggs.

08:30.635 --> 08:30.895
No?

08:31.536 --> 08:31.697
No.

08:31.877 --> 08:33.639
It's just the very latest PW.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.162
In fact, it's dated March 7th.

08:36.664 --> 08:38.106
And I took it to New York with me.

08:38.126 --> 08:38.847
I have it here.

08:38.907 --> 08:39.268
I read it.

08:39.308 --> 08:40.590
But it's a nice, nice interview.

08:40.830 --> 08:52.026
But the only reason I mention it is it does give some... I didn't realize, for instance, that you had been arrested once in the Peace Corps.

08:52.047 --> 08:52.888
That was news to me.

08:52.928 --> 08:53.609
Oh, yeah.

08:53.629 --> 08:56.353
I had problems with the Peace Corps.

08:56.373 --> 08:56.473
Yeah.

08:57.027 --> 08:58.108
Yeah.

08:58.749 --> 09:02.652
In fact, I was ejected from it in late 60s.

09:02.672 --> 09:03.873
That's an interesting story.

09:04.053 --> 09:05.014
I was too political.

09:06.535 --> 09:10.719
But, I mean, he does give your age as 52, which is pertinent to a degree.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.701
By the way, what is the date of that?

09:12.721 --> 09:13.442
March 7th.

09:15.123 --> 09:16.204
You got a fax down there?

09:17.225 --> 09:18.366
Yes, I do.

09:18.446 --> 09:19.847
Would you like me to fax this to you?

09:19.867 --> 09:21.249
That would be wonderful.

09:21.429 --> 09:23.070
You don't mind that there's some notes on it?

09:23.210 --> 09:23.991
I mean, I've written on it.

09:24.011 --> 09:24.331
Not at all.

09:24.411 --> 09:26.173
I'll give you my fax.

09:26.390 --> 09:26.971
Okay.

09:28.373 --> 09:30.156
It's 508-888-9192.

09:30.176 --> 09:34.282
9192.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.445
Okay, I'll fax this to you when we're done.

09:37.367 --> 09:37.888
Okay.

09:38.148 --> 09:39.190
I really appreciate it.

09:39.210 --> 09:44.217
As long as you don't mind my having written on it and stars and stuff, you know, just some ideas.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.743
My daughter's playing the piano upstairs.

09:47.843 --> 09:49.866
Wonderful.

09:51.263 --> 10:20.882
uh where was i i i guess the reason i mentioned that is uh you know the age the midlife is this very definitely a uh a novel written by a man in his early 50s i would say so i said to someone um i wrote a piece for a law magazine uh and it's in this month it's actually about it's the origin of the book this is another thing that uh jonathan marda and irina said

10:21.301 --> 10:24.405
We've contacted a lawyer.

10:24.425 --> 10:24.906
I said, oh, yeah.

10:24.926 --> 10:26.228
And they said, they want you.

10:26.308 --> 10:29.212
And I said, they want me to write an article.

10:30.073 --> 10:34.318
I said, well, you know, I said, of course.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.261
But aren't they going to interview you?

10:36.281 --> 10:39.025
And they said, no, they would really rather that you wrote something.

10:39.465 --> 10:42.749
And I said, well, that's a lot of work, you know, a 2,000-word piece.

10:42.769 --> 10:43.931
Are they going to pay you for this?

10:44.011 --> 10:46.975
I mean, the thing is, I was working on something.

10:47.296 --> 10:48.477
I was actually working on a script.

10:49.338 --> 10:50.700
So they said, um,

10:51.946 --> 10:53.793
They fixed me up with an assignment.

10:53.913 --> 10:55.097
But I don't want an assignment.

10:55.238 --> 10:59.212
I wanted, you know, maybe to do what you and I are doing now.

10:59.232 --> 10:59.372
Yeah.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.500
Talk for an hour or so and whatever.

11:01.987 --> 11:31.437
and let the other guy do it which is yeah because that's well anyway so i wrote the piece but if you get the piece um well now what's the publication allure a-l-l-u-r-e oh allure okay i thought you were saying a law a law review or something no no allure it's makeup magazine but it's pretty good well who are you trying to hit hit there who are you trying to reach in that magazine ask them that i don't know i don't know

11:32.227 --> 11:33.068
Interesting, huh?

11:33.088 --> 11:34.109
2,000 words?

11:35.191 --> 11:37.093
And so what was this piece about?

11:37.634 --> 11:38.015
Go ahead.

11:38.035 --> 11:49.830
No, the piece is about the origins, where I got the idea, right on the Mosquito Coast, traveling in the Pacific.

11:49.990 --> 11:57.981
I was in New Guinea, and some people on an island had lovely teeth, and I realized I'm shortening the story.

11:58.703 --> 12:01.326
come to the point that they were a Seventh-day Adventist.

12:01.987 --> 12:09.095
They were eating very, very good food, and they were the healthiest people in the Trobriand Island.

12:09.115 --> 12:10.016
So I went on in that vein.

12:10.296 --> 12:17.284
But I guess what started this is my question, is this a work, a midlife work?

12:17.344 --> 12:18.625
Okay, that's a fair question.

12:19.246 --> 12:28.356
So you say, yes, and someone asked me in the law for their biographical note.

12:28.943 --> 12:35.529
And the sound bite they got was, when I was younger, I wrote about people smoking marijuana and drinking too much.

12:35.589 --> 12:42.395
Now that I'm a bit older, I'm writing about people who are interested in longevity, health, and eating right.

12:45.177 --> 12:47.199
I mean, it's true.

12:47.339 --> 12:50.602
In the family arsenal, the guy smokes opium.

12:50.882 --> 12:54.125
I, you know, smoked and drank.

12:54.165 --> 12:55.867
I was never a heavy drinker.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.309
I never really drank, and I still don't drink much.

12:58.964 --> 13:00.886
I wasn't even a heavy smoker, but I smoked.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.608
But the thing is, it's true.

13:02.668 --> 13:20.548
At a certain age, when I turned 40, this is 81 or so, I got interested in health and living a little bit longer and figuring out what I should do maybe to enable that to happen.

13:21.148 --> 13:24.272
And I think it's quite a natural thing.

13:24.332 --> 13:26.254
Some people just

13:27.179 --> 13:30.083
They make no allowances whatsoever.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.808
They just carry on and drink pretty much the way they always did.

13:33.828 --> 13:36.331
But I decided to make a few adjustments.

13:36.351 --> 13:40.716
And as a consequence, I started writing about them.

13:40.817 --> 13:56.697
Because my life was always in my work, it would be inconceivable for me to care about eating in an interesting way and then not write about it.

13:56.896 --> 14:08.571
I found myself today giving someone a ride, just dropping someone off, and she had had a weight problem.

14:08.591 --> 14:12.776
And I started asking her about her weight, and she was really interesting.

14:12.836 --> 14:17.021
Again, this is something I wish I had met her a year and a half ago, because she was so wonderful.

14:17.101 --> 14:21.227
She would wake up in the middle of the night and eat a pint of ice cream, cherries.

14:21.247 --> 14:21.968
I said, what flavor?

14:22.568 --> 14:25.452
She said it was brownie, you know.

14:27.862 --> 14:33.630
Anyway, but I find myself riveted by that kind of thing.

14:33.650 --> 14:38.938
So I find it interesting, fascinating, amusing, enlightening.

14:38.958 --> 14:44.305
And then this is also part of my life.

14:45.527 --> 14:46.889
So is it a midlife thing?

14:46.909 --> 14:48.531
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

14:49.512 --> 14:55.000
And fortunately, a lot of people in midlife buy books.

14:55.486 --> 14:57.589
They're exactly the same as me.

14:57.609 --> 14:58.350
They're the same age.

14:58.391 --> 14:59.572
They're thinking about these things.

14:59.592 --> 15:00.414
They're doing these things.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.539
I took up kayaking 10 years ago.

15:03.579 --> 15:05.241
How old was I?

15:05.281 --> 15:05.482
42.

15:05.502 --> 15:06.203
42, yeah.

15:06.724 --> 15:13.434
And before then, I hadn't really done a lot of heavy exercise, but I thought, nah, I think I'll get out a bit more.

15:13.735 --> 15:15.878
So I wrote The Happy Hours of Oceania.

15:15.898 --> 15:20.645
It was a fun trip because I was able to do it paddling a kayak.

15:21.346 --> 15:23.670
And I was getting from...

15:24.241 --> 15:47.785
island to island and i was writing about it this fellow in the pw piece uh suggests that uh uh maybe maybe it's true maybe it's not uh of course i think of you as a total writer uh but he he suggests that the world at large the reading world at large knows you as the travel writer it might be surprised to learn that you do you know these novels

15:48.119 --> 15:57.033
It's funny, isn't it, that he should say that when, first I started out writing novels, and I've published many more novels than I have traveled, and I think of myself as a novelist.

15:57.994 --> 16:03.583
But people do say things like that, and I can't remember this guy.

16:03.803 --> 16:04.805
He must have been younger.

16:05.025 --> 16:05.706
I don't know him.

16:07.048 --> 16:14.700
In fact, his name is Sam Staggs, and all it says is Staggs is a frequent contributor to PW.

16:14.984 --> 16:18.470
And I'll tell you, it's a very good biographical piece.

16:18.550 --> 16:27.446
It says really very little about the book at hand except, here's a quote, Millroy the Magician is about an obsession with food, diet, and American culture.

16:27.466 --> 16:28.688
In fact, this is a quote from you.

16:28.708 --> 16:32.715
It's my own life, in a sense, writ large and embroidered upon.

16:32.735 --> 16:33.736
Maybe.

16:34.237 --> 16:34.598
Maybe.

16:35.499 --> 16:37.583
Yeah, I mean, that's...

16:38.018 --> 16:41.105
I'm not, and again, I'm not asking you to quote on somebody else's story.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.411
I just hope to have it here at hand.

16:44.072 --> 16:45.215
No, I understand.

16:45.235 --> 16:54.357
But his statement, someone else thought of something, something about Paul Theroux.

16:54.775 --> 17:21.610
you know better known as travel writer but he writes novels too yeah well he said that he says here for instance which uh uh that they might be surprised to learn that that you that you wrote pesquito coast you know which was a movie that you i mean jesus christ that was one of his very best novels i thought you know i know uh anyway some people are oblivious of

17:22.400 --> 17:23.741
you know, things that you do.

17:23.822 --> 17:27.806
A lot of people never knew that Delmore Schwartz wrote short stories.

17:27.846 --> 17:28.947
They thought he was just a poet.

17:28.987 --> 17:35.014
And actually, he was a very accomplished short story and thought of himself as a short story writer.

17:35.875 --> 17:45.105
And, I mean, they think that Robert Louis Stevenson only wrote Treasure Island.

17:45.125 --> 17:51.572
They don't realize that he wrote dozens of other books, many of them much greater than Treasure Island.

17:51.672 --> 17:51.732
But

17:52.184 --> 17:54.528
You get, that's just the way of the world.

17:54.869 --> 18:03.104
I think the helpful thing is when books are, not all my books are in print and paperback, but they're sort of going back into print and paperback now.

18:03.124 --> 18:12.101
And it's really the availability of books that conditions what people think about you, whether they can find you in a bookstore.

18:12.381 --> 18:14.445
And when they can, then they begin to revise that.

18:15.252 --> 18:32.297
Do you feel, I mean, because you do write in so many different forms, I mean, do you say, well, I finished the novel, now it's time, maybe perhaps to do a collection of stories, or it's time to get on the road again, get out there and travel wherever?

18:32.317 --> 18:35.902
Your question is, how do I decide what you're doing?

18:38.506 --> 18:43.032
I tend to be working on a fictional project all the time.

18:43.282 --> 18:47.708
This is a kind of continuous process.

18:47.728 --> 18:54.819
For example, when I was traveling in the Pacific, I was working on a novella called Lady Max, which appeared in Granthamack.

18:54.839 --> 18:55.560
Do you know Granthamack?

18:55.580 --> 18:56.561
Yes.

18:56.581 --> 18:56.681
Okay.

18:56.701 --> 18:59.946
It appeared there about four issues ago.

19:01.709 --> 19:07.076
There's a Richard Ford story, which is the cover story, and mine was in that.

19:07.096 --> 19:12.985
So this Lady Max I was working on, the one that just before then I had written...

19:13.319 --> 19:14.320
My Secret History.

19:15.001 --> 19:19.666
Then I, after I finished My Secret History, I started this long story.

19:19.686 --> 19:22.689
And I was writing it while I was writing the Pacific book.

19:22.749 --> 19:26.673
When I finished the Pacific book, I wrote Milroy.

19:27.394 --> 19:42.229
And after I finished Milroy, I've been working on a long story, which I think will be a collection, or it might be, it's a book very similar to My Secret History.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.873
And so I've been working on this fiction.

19:45.933 --> 19:54.321
In other words, I don't... I see the writing of fiction as a continuous activity.

19:54.742 --> 19:57.164
I have never really stopped doing it.

19:58.065 --> 20:03.551
But every so often, I really feel the need to get away.

20:05.453 --> 20:11.980
I feel a tremendous curiosity about a place, and usually a very large place, area, region.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.443
and think of a way of seeing it.

20:15.144 --> 20:18.629
And I've been sort of thinking about that at the moment, where I might go.

20:18.729 --> 20:21.092
But at the same time, I'm working on these stories.

20:21.112 --> 20:23.816
So I think I'm not doing a lot of things at the same time.

20:23.836 --> 20:25.338
I'm only doing one thing at a time.

20:26.660 --> 20:33.769
But fiction is the continuous, sort of predictable activity that I pursue.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.313
What place?

20:36.597 --> 20:41.845
I mean, where do you hear the muses, the siren song beckoning from now?

20:41.865 --> 20:52.200
A lot of places, because I'm aware of the fact that there's parts of the world that I've covered pretty well.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.886
China, South America, India, and so forth.

20:56.906 --> 20:57.748
But I had England.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.091
I've never been to Africa.

21:00.151 --> 21:01.573
I've never written about Africa.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.575
I lived in Africa for a while.

21:03.135 --> 21:04.137
I've never written about Africa.

21:04.177 --> 21:05.018
I've never written about

21:05.504 --> 21:10.049
Scandinavia, Canada, Alaska, sort of northern hemisphere.

21:10.109 --> 21:13.533
I've never written about Brazil, though I went to South America.

21:13.573 --> 21:19.340
And I'm keenly aware that I have never really done much about the Mediterranean.

21:19.660 --> 21:22.784
So I've got these four possibilities.

21:22.924 --> 21:24.085
There's a lot, actually.

21:24.406 --> 21:27.049
Oh, plenty, yeah.

21:27.069 --> 21:27.489
Plenty.

21:28.190 --> 21:28.610
Plenty.

21:29.011 --> 21:30.713
And all interesting.

21:30.733 --> 21:35.258
So there's no shortage of... Even, you know, one of the most, to me...

21:35.963 --> 21:46.898
one of the strangest and most interesting travel books would be a book about... would be the same trip at a different time.

21:46.958 --> 21:52.725
In other words, taking the same trip again and writing about it.

21:52.785 --> 21:56.130
You'd hate to have people think this is Jaws 2, on the other hand.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.512
No, it's not.

21:57.592 --> 22:00.976
It would be... No, that's true.

22:01.457 --> 22:02.899
But when you think that...

22:03.031 --> 22:03.612
It wouldn't be.

22:03.632 --> 22:04.173
It couldn't be.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.057
It wouldn't be George.

22:07.478 --> 22:07.959
I'm teasing.

22:08.059 --> 22:08.760
You know what I'm saying.

22:08.981 --> 22:09.221
I know.

22:10.383 --> 22:10.844
I know you are.

22:11.585 --> 22:12.486
But when you think that.

22:12.506 --> 22:15.691
When I went to the railway resort, I wrote 20 years ago.

22:15.711 --> 22:18.776
I actually finished taking the trip 20 years ago.

22:18.796 --> 22:22.823
I went in 73, finished in 74, wrote the book in 75.

22:23.865 --> 22:26.990
I guess the book appeared in 75.

22:27.010 --> 22:30.355
But it was, you know, I went through Turkey.

22:30.740 --> 22:37.647
Iran, Afghanistan, Vietnam, all these places that have changed and came back through the Soviet Union.

22:37.667 --> 22:41.030
That would be interesting, wouldn't it, huh?

22:41.090 --> 22:42.351
Totally different.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.053
Life is all politically different.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.575
And the routes are different.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.897
Some of them have, they're easier to travel.

22:49.077 --> 22:49.538
And guess what?

22:49.558 --> 22:50.379
You're different, too.

22:51.019 --> 22:52.481
Yeah, yeah.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.423
I mean, you'd be carrying different baggage, wouldn't you?

22:55.463 --> 22:57.085
Totally, totally.

22:57.301 --> 23:00.705
Or maybe not totally, but quite different.

23:01.366 --> 23:08.414
So I had thought, I'm not going to do that, because I'd like to go to new places.

23:09.555 --> 23:14.020
But it strikes me as being, you know, someone should do it all.

23:14.081 --> 23:14.761
Maybe I will.

23:14.821 --> 23:15.262
I don't know.

23:15.282 --> 23:19.126
Well, I mean, there's only one person that can do that for your books, and that's you.

23:19.146 --> 23:23.532
I don't know if anyone has ever taken that kind of trip.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.654
It's just as though...

23:26.225 --> 23:34.995
Later in life, Graham Greene went from Sierra Leone into Liberia again and wrote Journey Without Maps again.

23:35.577 --> 23:38.547
It would be, it would just, everyone's different.

23:38.813 --> 23:42.218
I'm not familiar with that later work.

23:42.239 --> 23:43.280
About West Africa.

23:43.300 --> 23:49.150
Yeah, but how did that work compared to... No, no, he didn't go again, but I said it's just as if... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.712
No, no, he didn't.

23:50.792 --> 23:52.094
In fact, he swore he would ever go back.

23:52.215 --> 23:53.437
Okay.

23:53.677 --> 23:58.284
That's why I was saying, geez, I don't know if that's... No, no, no, I don't know anyone who's done it twice.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.568
But to me, it strikes me as being...

24:01.308 --> 24:02.590
Well, you're certainly young enough.

24:02.771 --> 24:04.795
You could do it at some point.

24:05.636 --> 24:09.043
But obviously, there's no dearth of ideas.

24:09.263 --> 24:12.910
I mean, it's just the time to do them all, I guess.

24:12.950 --> 24:17.098
The problem is that it does travel as you get older.

24:19.523 --> 24:21.527
Is...

24:22.182 --> 24:24.965
It seems more difficult.

24:24.985 --> 24:28.028
I get to the point where I think, oh, God, this is terrible.

24:28.488 --> 24:29.629
I hate being on this plane.

24:30.050 --> 24:31.411
I hate being in this town.

24:31.531 --> 24:32.992
I hate being on this plane.

24:33.012 --> 24:38.197
Or I think this is an awful lot of trouble to go to to begin travel, you know, going to a plane.

24:38.217 --> 24:39.078
So you get crankier.

24:39.819 --> 24:40.480
You get crankier.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.420
You get more demanding.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.924
And also you think, why am I putting up with this inconvenience?

24:44.944 --> 24:48.707
And it does color the story that you're going to write because you're angry.

24:49.648 --> 24:51.430
Not angry, but...

24:51.747 --> 24:53.129
Why do you think I don't have to do this?

24:54.250 --> 24:56.632
Yeah, but that's certainly going to color the product, the written product.

24:56.672 --> 25:00.316
I mean, you might not be giving this place a fair shake because of this feeling, too.

25:00.336 --> 25:07.164
I'm aware of that, and that's why I go to quite a lot of trouble to... Excuse me.

25:07.985 --> 25:09.887
Bless you.

25:09.907 --> 25:18.616
I don't want to do that, but I think there's nothing good that you can say about air travel, you know, long-distance air travel.

25:18.636 --> 25:19.257
This is nothing...

25:20.536 --> 25:21.077
good about it.

25:21.097 --> 25:23.259
Yeah, but let's say you get stuck at the Athens airport.

25:23.279 --> 25:24.180
You're there for half a day.

25:24.260 --> 25:25.382
It happens to everybody.

25:25.402 --> 25:26.823
I was stuck in London the other day.

25:26.863 --> 25:28.846
I was on a flight.

25:28.866 --> 25:30.407
Oh, when the mortar shells were coming in?

25:31.188 --> 25:32.650
When the mortar shells were coming in?

25:32.690 --> 25:35.113
No, no, this is, no, London to Boston.

25:35.133 --> 25:35.433
Oh, yeah.

25:35.453 --> 25:36.455
No, no, no, no, no.

25:36.895 --> 25:38.157
I heard about that in the face.

25:38.177 --> 25:38.337
Yeah.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.339
This was a week before.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.304
And, uh, excuse me.

25:44.324 --> 25:44.704
Bless you.

25:44.964 --> 25:47.728
Um, I was on a flight.

25:47.748 --> 25:48.889
They said, okay, um, the

25:49.207 --> 25:51.209
We've got an electrical problem, everyone off.

25:51.429 --> 25:53.272
You know, I had to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

25:53.492 --> 25:56.535
It's been 1 o'clock, everyone off.

25:56.635 --> 25:58.177
They said, there's a flight leaving at 3.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.939
It's going to Minneapolis.

25:59.959 --> 26:00.920
We'll redirect you.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.542
And God.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.143
You don't need this.

26:05.445 --> 26:06.066
Sorry.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.608
Excuse me.

26:08.389 --> 26:10.631
Earlier today, I was out paddling my kayak.

26:10.651 --> 26:12.133
And that's why I got dismissals.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.656
It's very windy.

26:14.716 --> 26:15.957
Yeah.

26:17.152 --> 26:23.537
So, yeah, there's a lot of inconvenience, and then good things happen, too, in travel.

26:24.138 --> 26:29.222
Once you get all that behind you, there are nice things.

26:29.242 --> 26:32.605
When does the story start to develop, or does it develop when you get back?

26:34.226 --> 26:38.610
The Milroy story started long ago.

26:38.650 --> 26:46.737
I mean, it started, I think, when I was writing, maybe it started when I read Elma Gantry.

26:46.835 --> 26:48.457
Oh, really?

26:48.477 --> 26:52.043
Or me, or Flannery O'Connor, what is that?

26:53.665 --> 26:55.508
Wise Blood, or... Could be.

26:56.329 --> 26:59.113
Everything That Rises Must Converge.

26:59.193 --> 27:00.055
Those are both hers.

27:00.115 --> 27:04.001
Do you know that... What is the other one?

27:05.503 --> 27:12.994
Anyway, that kind of... I love that...

27:13.598 --> 27:15.340
the preacher story, always did.

27:16.262 --> 27:19.486
Maybe it started with Jim Jones.

27:19.506 --> 27:22.269
Just being aware of it.

27:22.830 --> 27:30.240
For me, that's one of the, in my lifetime, that's one of the most striking things that's happened in my lifetime.

27:30.280 --> 27:35.086
I would say that the Jonestown self-suicide.

27:35.206 --> 27:38.230
Whatever.

27:38.250 --> 27:41.715
That is on a par with

27:43.197 --> 27:46.621
with the Vietnam War, with the death of Kennedy.

27:47.382 --> 27:47.762
Really?

27:47.782 --> 27:48.743
With the end of the Cold War.

27:49.104 --> 27:49.925
Yeah, definitely.

27:50.105 --> 27:50.365
Why?

27:50.445 --> 27:54.190
Because, I mean, they almost seem like an aberrational group.

27:54.630 --> 28:02.779
It does seem so, but it's a very large number, and it's because of race that was a factor.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.082
Poverty was a factor.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.725
Rejection of the state was a factor.

28:09.667 --> 28:12.090
The fact that Leo Ryan...

28:13.066 --> 28:15.349
was killed, you know, the congressman.

28:15.389 --> 28:16.430
The congressman, yeah.

28:16.450 --> 28:25.680
Everything that went along with it, not just this one guy with a group of cranks in the jungle, but that it, these were people that we know.

28:25.700 --> 28:34.751
I mean, you run across this sort of person all the time who finds hope with a leader, and he had churches round about.

28:35.051 --> 28:36.433
He had met Rosalind Carter.

28:36.453 --> 28:40.137
I mean, Jim Jones is a type that, he's quite a familiar type.

28:40.555 --> 28:41.943
You do see him.

28:41.963 --> 28:43.149
He's kind of on the fringes.

28:43.190 --> 28:44.597
He's the organizer.

28:44.617 --> 28:46.629
He gets people out to vote.

28:46.769 --> 28:47.815
He's the man, you know,

28:48.065 --> 28:50.488
Well, the guy down in Waco is not unlike him, right?

28:50.548 --> 28:51.309
Not unlike him.

28:51.449 --> 28:51.929
Not at all.

28:52.150 --> 28:52.630
Not at all.

28:52.650 --> 28:56.695
Except that there was something bigger about Jim Jones.

28:56.715 --> 29:00.900
Well, if there were 900 people in the compound, maybe they all would have gone up in flames, too, though.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.161
Very likely.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.343
But you actually, the origin of the... Right.

29:04.504 --> 29:06.025
Oh, no, where does the book come from?

29:06.045 --> 29:10.090
I think they start... There's a seed very early.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.553
I don't know whether... The first one must be very, very early.

29:12.613 --> 29:14.975
But to me, it starts with a character.

29:14.995 --> 29:16.858
It starts with a person, always.

29:16.878 --> 29:17.278
And then...

29:17.798 --> 29:19.741
what that person is capable of doing.

29:20.923 --> 29:34.905
And I always saw, I mean, any character that I've written about, I could recall thinking of the person and thinking of what they do and what they say.

29:35.886 --> 29:45.221
And they're all, as I say, I guess, versions of writers.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.202
I don't write about

29:46.975 --> 29:51.921
recluses or people who are not doers.

29:51.941 --> 29:53.363
They tend to be doers.

29:53.383 --> 29:56.947
Think of my novel, Picture Palette, The Woman's a Photographer.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.590
Well, she's a photographer, but she might be a writer.

30:01.192 --> 30:08.300
In Family Arsenal, the central character there on Jungle Belfast, in other words, going way back, they're very active people.

30:08.961 --> 30:11.464
And organizing or, you know,

30:11.883 --> 30:12.824
getting things done.

30:12.844 --> 30:16.728
And as the physicians would say, they take invasive procedures, right?

30:16.748 --> 30:20.432
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

30:20.452 --> 30:38.891
They, they, so I, the origin of this obviously is, it's not only what, you know, people I've met, it's the news, the news affects me, just, you know, life affects me, things that I know, things that I've read.

30:38.911 --> 30:39.932
I was,

30:40.081 --> 30:42.705
Very, very determined not to write.

30:42.725 --> 30:45.949
I didn't want to write a book about a hypocrite.

30:45.969 --> 30:58.105
Typically, this novel could be about a priest or a preacher who has this group of youngsters and he's abusing them in some way.

30:59.026 --> 31:03.092
That's very much of the moment.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.794
But I didn't want to write that.

31:04.874 --> 31:06.156
First, I think it's been written.

31:06.676 --> 31:12.363
Virtually every book about an evangelist or a preacher or a priest is about a hypocrite.

31:12.703 --> 31:13.745
Elmogantry is about a hypocrite.

31:13.765 --> 31:15.887
I mean, you just mentioned Elmogantry right earlier.

31:15.927 --> 31:18.911
This is the quintessential hypocrite, of course.

31:18.991 --> 31:25.259
And in The Power of the Glory, the priest is a drinker and has a mistress and a child.

31:27.181 --> 31:36.092
It's very hard to find a priest or preacher in literature who's not reading every law who rules the book.

31:36.697 --> 31:45.105
And some of the best priests, for example, are written... I mean, some of the most interesting writing along this line is by J.F.

31:45.206 --> 31:45.586
Powers.

31:45.606 --> 31:46.327
Do you know his work?

31:46.367 --> 31:46.587
Yes.

31:47.228 --> 31:50.551
The Prince of Darkness, the stories, and Mort Durbin.

31:50.851 --> 31:54.535
But that's... I find his stuff interesting.

31:54.715 --> 31:55.836
He's not writing about hypocrites.

31:55.856 --> 32:00.201
He writes about priests as... As I understand, a random house dropped him.

32:01.202 --> 32:01.682
Did you know that?

32:01.862 --> 32:02.903
No, I didn't know that.

32:02.923 --> 32:04.585
Somebody told me that.

32:04.605 --> 32:06.467
He's...

32:07.207 --> 32:13.777
I should say James Joyce because he's not a great stylist, but he's a tremendously interesting writer.

32:13.797 --> 32:16.421
And I've been reading him since I was in high school.

32:16.441 --> 32:18.565
He writes with a Catholic sensibility, doesn't he?

32:18.605 --> 32:19.826
Yeah.

32:19.867 --> 32:24.654
But his priests drink, they play golf, they show up at the Rotary Club.

32:24.674 --> 32:27.038
They're just Rotarians.

32:27.058 --> 32:30.162
And he's really, really good.

32:30.202 --> 32:31.244
He's also very funny.

32:32.847 --> 32:33.788
But I was...

32:34.257 --> 32:41.311
deeply influenced by him, because I have had a religious upbringing, and then when I read him, I thought, these are the people I know.

32:41.331 --> 32:49.768
I understand the priest in his book, because these are the sort of good-time charlies, glad-handing

32:49.934 --> 32:52.097
smoking, drinking priest that I knew.

32:52.117 --> 32:54.180
I didn't know Pius one more.

32:54.200 --> 33:01.952
One of my favorite guys when I was on my aircraft carrier back in the Vietnam War was this Catholic priest from Boston, Father Dunn.

33:02.553 --> 33:14.531
And we used to go into Japan, and boy, he would be right over there in the Hutsey baths, and I can't say he would be doing anything beyond the steam half and the massage, but he had a good time.

33:14.571 --> 33:15.793
He was a lovely man.

33:17.456 --> 33:18.878
That's true.

33:18.858 --> 33:25.307
I like that, what you just said, because it's not hypocrisy, but there's something human about it.

33:25.868 --> 33:29.393
And he's obviously not a candidate for sainter.

33:29.413 --> 33:34.039
On the other hand, you wouldn't say, oh, he's a hypocrite, he doesn't practice what he preaches.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.601
He's like the rest of us.

33:36.423 --> 33:43.793
So I wanted Milroy to be more like that than like David Koresh or Albert Gantry.

33:44.314 --> 33:47.498
I thought, I don't want there to be an

33:48.136 --> 33:50.479
an ugly surprise or an ugly secret.

33:50.539 --> 33:59.471
I actually wanted him to be odd and even slightly scandalous.

33:59.491 --> 34:06.561
Now, didn't Updike suggest the possibility of a Nabokovian scene here, a Lolita kind of a thing?

34:06.581 --> 34:07.682
He mentioned that.

34:07.702 --> 34:08.063
That's right.

34:08.443 --> 34:14.211
He said someone actually wants us to believe that this man can actually...

34:14.613 --> 34:21.062
cohabit with a little girl, dressed her up as a boy and so forth, and not put a foot wrong.

34:21.222 --> 34:22.644
Actually, it is a love story.

34:23.866 --> 34:26.330
Toward the end, he does declare his love.

34:26.730 --> 34:30.936
And she's a bit older, and he says, you know, I really do, I love you.

34:31.377 --> 34:39.388
And she's totally freaked out by it, of course, because up to that moment, she's just seen him as a guardian, as his sort of father figure.

34:39.908 --> 34:43.473
Well, I don't think that's so unusual or unbelievable.

34:43.813 --> 34:54.146
It's believable that he doesn't do anything, and it's believable that he makes his move after a period of time, that he gains her confidence.

34:54.166 --> 34:57.170
How essential was she to this, to the structure here?

34:57.471 --> 35:01.876
I mean, because he, the book, the initial character clearly is him.

35:02.116 --> 35:03.759
I mean, he's the subject.

35:04.540 --> 35:08.785
But, you know, why the adolescent narrator, I guess?

35:08.883 --> 35:28.310
I think, well, I wanted someone who was truthful, a totally reliable man, and one who was somewhat suspending her disbelief, and someone that he was affecting.

35:28.330 --> 35:34.418
So it's that, it's more, I can't think where I've,

35:34.837 --> 35:43.146
I think of it as, you know, a writer that affected me a lot is Joyce Carey.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.228
I don't know whether you've read much of his work.

35:45.388 --> 35:45.608
No.

35:45.809 --> 35:47.530
The Horse's Mouth or... No.

35:48.171 --> 35:55.759
Anyway, he has this kind of... He often has a kind of... Excuse me.

35:55.919 --> 35:59.343
He has a spouse telling a story.

35:59.643 --> 36:02.346
And it starts saying, well, you know, this one...

36:04.435 --> 36:10.004
Nina Nimmo, it's a book called Not Honor More, where she's telling a story about her husband.

36:10.024 --> 36:16.435
Her husband is an amazing guy, but she's just there making bread and saying, well, he came home and he said this, then he did this.

36:16.916 --> 36:22.425
And she's telling you this story about an extraordinary man, but she's an ordinary person.

36:23.106 --> 36:26.672
But you tend to believe that person more.

36:26.732 --> 36:29.336
And then when she registers the prize, then you do.

36:29.777 --> 36:30.358
But it's not...

36:30.710 --> 36:32.152
In other words, it's not telling you anything.

36:32.192 --> 36:39.064
It's actually telling you it's a reliable witness.

36:39.204 --> 36:46.557
Anyway, I thought that this young girl type is also a type that I run across.

36:46.737 --> 36:49.822
Say on the Cape, for example, the one that's always saying Zoe.

36:51.425 --> 36:55.792
And I'm like, why is he doing this to me?

36:55.872 --> 36:56.413
And he's like,

36:56.765 --> 36:57.929
Why did you do it?

36:58.070 --> 36:58.953
He's like, it's wicked.

36:59.495 --> 37:04.112
This is the kind of language that I find fascinating, too.

37:05.417 --> 37:07.163
And just someone who might

37:08.105 --> 37:09.627
turn up at a county fair.

37:09.647 --> 37:12.090
And there's a freshness to it, of course, too.

37:12.110 --> 37:12.891
I hope so.

37:12.911 --> 37:14.193
It must be quite a challenge.

37:14.273 --> 37:24.807
I mean, we all say, those of us who read Shakespeare, I mean, if the man has a feeling, it was his inability to characterize the young person, you know?

37:24.887 --> 37:28.171
I mean, all those youngsters sound like brilliant little people, you know?

37:28.732 --> 37:29.192
Unfortunately.

37:31.575 --> 37:33.538
He does have a few kids.

37:33.518 --> 37:38.706
There's a kid, Marmelius, in The Winter's Tale, who's not too... Really?

37:39.707 --> 37:40.689
Yeah.

37:41.510 --> 37:59.576
He's the daughter of Leonti... Okay, we'll just... You know, going back 20-odd years ago, I used to teach Shakespeare's Problem Plague.

37:59.676 --> 38:01.399
Yeah, so that...

38:02.088 --> 38:03.289
But you're right.

38:03.569 --> 38:13.919
But my point is it's quite a risk for you to take because the authenticity of this narrator is, I mean, if she fails, the book fails.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.763
So you really have to be damn sure that you can pull this thing off.

38:18.284 --> 38:21.006
Her voice, her psyche, and the whole works.

38:21.567 --> 38:22.488
I think that's true.

38:23.629 --> 38:25.491
And you can't be put off by it.

38:26.612 --> 38:28.333
Intimidated by it probably either.

38:28.373 --> 38:29.074
Yeah.

38:29.493 --> 38:31.395
Ben, I'm sorry, I interrupted you saying something.

38:31.975 --> 38:35.739
No, I was going to say that there are people who would just be bewildered by this.

38:35.819 --> 38:46.249
What is this 52-year-old, this spectacled guy sitting there doing a kind of ventriloquism act with a 14-year-old girl?

38:46.790 --> 38:51.594
Well, it's the magician, too, as a writer, the writer as a magician.

38:51.614 --> 38:53.856
I guess you can conjure this youngster.

38:54.557 --> 38:56.479
Yes, there's that, too.

38:56.729 --> 39:11.671
But I think it's, Mosquito Coast is told by Fox, and I always, I had tried to write that story a number of different ways.

39:11.791 --> 39:15.537
I tried to narrate it, and I wasn't quite sure how it should be done.

39:15.577 --> 39:22.266
When I did it, I thought that he would be a very important character, Charlie, telling it.

39:22.747 --> 39:26.112
Then I realized that telling the story, he's not.

39:26.564 --> 39:29.607
It's the father that's important.

39:29.627 --> 39:30.588
And he's talking about his father.

39:31.009 --> 39:35.274
And you stop paying very much attention to Charlie.

39:36.295 --> 39:40.660
And the father assumes a very central place because Charlie's talking about him.

39:41.180 --> 39:44.484
And there's also a resonance because he is talking about him.

39:45.065 --> 39:48.889
But you pay less attention to the son than the father.

39:50.250 --> 39:54.495
And it also is helpful if the person being written about

39:54.728 --> 40:11.548
is very articulate, because that person can then describe, for example, or Ali Fox, have a rather oracular tone, and they're very, very articulate.

40:11.988 --> 40:22.761
But there's this tremendous stylishness in the way they speak, and all the kids are doing is reporting this speech, and that's actually quite helpful, too.

40:22.808 --> 40:24.990
I mean, it's a satire.

40:25.610 --> 40:29.614
It's a satire, of course.

40:32.416 --> 40:43.706
Do you set out to poke fun at contemporary America or do you set out to tell a hell of a really enjoyable story and this other stuff takes care of itself?

40:43.726 --> 40:51.853
I think that I set out to tell this extraordinary, what I think of as an amazing story and to

40:52.323 --> 40:55.908
And I hope that the reader is riveted by it.

40:56.970 --> 41:01.476
In the meantime, it is about the way we live now.

41:01.516 --> 41:08.066
It's about the life going on around us on television in life.

41:08.086 --> 41:12.272
It's about health and longevity and faith.

41:12.607 --> 41:41.955
all the things that we want for ourselves and we're willing to make allowances for or to adapt ourselves for and I don't know anyone else who does this if you go to other countries people say well I was born with this body and this fate and I think I'll just sort of follow it down the line it's rare for people to say I'm going to

41:42.543 --> 41:47.832
I'm going to reshape my life, first my body and then my soul, and then I'm going to live longer.

41:47.972 --> 41:57.328
The idea of rejuvenation and revitalizing and living longer than your parents and all that, but consciously doing it is embarrassing.

41:57.764 --> 42:01.388
You know, and it must be a tightrope that you have to walk.

42:01.428 --> 42:14.064
On the one hand, you really want it to identify, particularly, it's a book of the 1990s, as the mosquito coast, as we mentioned earlier, was a book of the 1970s.

42:14.364 --> 42:16.807
But on the other hand, you don't want it to be dated either.

42:16.847 --> 42:25.257
You want people to pick it up 10 or 20 or 30 years later and say, this is a work of literature which maintains its resonance.

42:25.237 --> 42:49.742
that's true and i mean i hope that's the case but there is a book uh are you asking about um and i didn't even i haven't mentioned this to other people because it hasn't occurred to me but i read uh do you know um the book trilby by george dumouriez have you ever read it no okay it's not a great book but it's a book that the character spengali appears in really yeah

42:49.925 --> 43:02.544
Spengali is a magician, and Trilby is a young girl, and they sort of, they meet, and Spengali just sort of takes charge of her.

43:03.806 --> 43:08.032
And Trilby wears a hat, and that's where we get the expression, the Trilby hat.

43:08.313 --> 43:08.914
Okay.

43:09.534 --> 43:14.582
And so a lot of people say he's a real Spengali, but Spengali comes from that novel, and...

43:14.883 --> 43:23.971
It just occurred to me, but I read that, and I was thinking, this isn't a great book, but it's got a lot of charm, and it's very interesting.

43:24.251 --> 43:29.596
This old guy, and this rather pretty young girl.

43:30.637 --> 43:35.601
And Milroy is a kind of Spengalian, not kind of Spengalian, he is a Spengalian.

43:36.662 --> 43:43.208
And he even, you know, the magic and so forth.

43:43.228 --> 43:44.029
But I think this

43:44.515 --> 43:48.523
There's more substance to it than that.

43:50.087 --> 43:53.654
Which I have to ask you.

43:53.674 --> 43:55.518
I don't want to take up your whole afternoon.

43:55.578 --> 43:58.845
You have quite a lot.

43:59.106 --> 44:00.248
No, I still got a lot of stuff.

44:00.629 --> 44:01.972
You might end up with a lot more than you have.

44:01.992 --> 44:02.774
Well, it's always fine.

44:02.834 --> 44:05.359
I would much rather have more than...

44:05.980 --> 44:12.269
Just, I mean, how about finding all of these biblical eating references?

44:12.289 --> 44:14.452
Tell me a little bit about the research here.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.115
Oh, well, that's pretty easy.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.399
I mean, did you go to a concordance or something for this?

44:19.439 --> 44:21.422
No, although I have one.

44:21.663 --> 44:24.927
Occasionally, but concordances aren't that helpful.

44:24.967 --> 44:29.514
You look under fish and the pages of it.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.617
But it's...

44:32.677 --> 44:37.606
It's a lot of it just, you know, traveling in hotels reading the Gideon Bible.

44:39.509 --> 44:41.753
That's a great line.

44:42.575 --> 44:43.176
It's true.

44:43.416 --> 44:56.980
And the other is when these people in New Guinea told me that they didn't eat fish without scales, we don't eat snakes, we don't eat lizards, we don't eat turtles, we don't eat...

44:57.247 --> 45:02.874
We don't eat the things that are prohibited in Leviticus book, chapter 11.

45:05.297 --> 45:10.524
I was thinking, well, there must be a lot of things in the Bible that we don't know, that they're unaware of.

45:10.564 --> 45:14.129
And, you know, odd little verses.

45:14.149 --> 45:22.680
You come across the church and they say, oh, this church worships on Saturday, or this church believes in...

45:24.061 --> 45:34.052
the gift of tongues, for example, there are a lot in the south, Blossolalia, and it's mentioned in the book of Joel about the gift of tongues.

45:34.072 --> 45:42.802
Or they have, you know, the people with snakes, they do things with snakes down south and conjure with them.

45:42.822 --> 45:51.351
So they just take a verse and then they base a whole sect on it.

45:51.803 --> 45:59.733
And I began looking for odd verses, looking for things, not to write a book, but just out of curiosity.

45:59.753 --> 46:08.765
And I came across things like, in one part of the Bible, it's in the Mosaic Law of how women are forbidden to dress up like men.

46:09.646 --> 46:12.449
Or if a woman touches a man's testicle.

46:12.850 --> 46:19.178
If a woman's husband is fighting with another man, and the woman tries to help her husband,

46:19.816 --> 46:26.323
And it says, if he touches a man on the stone, she should be stoned to death.

46:26.483 --> 46:27.124
She should be killed.

46:27.924 --> 46:29.246
That kind of thing.

46:29.326 --> 46:31.929
And I was thinking... When you see this stuff, do you write it down?

46:31.949 --> 46:32.729
Do you jot it down?

46:32.790 --> 46:33.791
Yeah.

46:34.011 --> 46:35.693
I'm a note-taker.

46:35.993 --> 46:39.717
So I compiled a huge list of very unlikely things.

46:39.757 --> 46:40.758
Then my son was doing it.

46:40.778 --> 46:46.003
And my son was saying, do you know that there's two miracles of loaves and fishes?

46:46.143 --> 46:47.084
And I said, no, really.

46:47.104 --> 46:47.905
And he said, yeah, look.

46:48.266 --> 46:49.587
And he gave me the...

46:49.803 --> 46:55.850
He gave me a reference where the second miracle was.

46:56.311 --> 47:02.839
So the loaves and fishes happen twice, and one smaller than the other.

47:02.879 --> 47:11.549
One's thousands of the other, and one's about 5,000, the other's about 2,000 people, loaves or whatever.

47:12.611 --> 47:18.578
So it's that sort of... I didn't sit down to comb the Bible

47:19.267 --> 47:29.351
food references, I just got interested in the sort of hidden parts of it, in the lesser known parts of it.

47:30.414 --> 47:36.448
And I didn't use them, but I used the idea of there being a part of the Bible that

47:38.808 --> 47:40.170
Just a quick question.

47:40.330 --> 47:47.700
I don't know anyone who's read more books than you, and I have to say, you know, I read it.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.722
I read a lot.

47:49.643 --> 47:52.767
And I'm just wondering, are you a very structured person?

47:52.887 --> 47:58.395
I mean, do you have compartments for writing and for reading and for kayaking and all the other stuff?

47:58.475 --> 48:01.079
No, you know, I do an awful lot of reading when I travel.

48:01.199 --> 48:07.988
I was away for the past... I thought this book tour a week ago, but...

48:08.491 --> 48:11.474
Prior to that, for three weeks, I was traveling.

48:11.674 --> 48:12.895
I just had something to do.

48:12.915 --> 48:14.177
It was an assignment.

48:14.197 --> 48:19.702
And I find travel is very, very stimulating.

48:19.822 --> 48:21.284
And at first, you have a lot of time.

48:21.504 --> 48:22.985
And you have time to kill.

48:23.346 --> 48:24.146
And I was alone.

48:24.867 --> 48:26.409
So I read Frankenstein.

48:26.689 --> 48:30.212
And I read the Gene Reeves autobiography, Smile, Please.

48:30.353 --> 48:33.676
I read Robert Gustafson's travel book, Travels with a Donkey.

48:33.956 --> 48:36.979
I read Life of Francis Bacon, the Painter.

48:37.735 --> 48:39.838
Now, is this stuff that you packed and took with you?

48:39.858 --> 48:42.322
No, no, just... Or is this stuff you pick up along the way?

48:42.422 --> 48:45.767
Bacon, and then I thought, I think I should reread Frankenstein.

48:45.827 --> 48:46.308
I did that.

48:46.368 --> 48:47.690
Then I found a steamy.

48:47.710 --> 48:51.356
So every couple of days, I finished a book.

48:51.376 --> 48:53.178
But when I'm writing, I don't.

48:53.259 --> 48:54.561
I'm a slow reader.

48:54.581 --> 49:01.431
I was reading... I spent about a month or so reading Tender is the Night just, let's say, six months ago.

49:02.390 --> 49:05.853
So I read a lot, but I'm not a fast reader.

49:06.173 --> 49:13.740
The only point I'm making is that travel and vacations really allow me to read a lot.

49:14.060 --> 49:25.190
And then in the normal course of events, when I have a lot of writing to do, I read to relax my mind and before I go to bed read a couple of pages or during the day a couple.

49:25.230 --> 49:27.072
But I'm not really attacking a book.

49:28.453 --> 49:30.355
When's your prime writing time?

49:31.094 --> 49:32.236
Just out of curiosity?

49:33.938 --> 49:38.906
I'm a sort of nine-to-fiver, and so if I haven't done anything in the morning, then I work in the afternoon.

49:38.966 --> 49:41.110
If I have a good morning, then I take the afternoon off.

49:41.771 --> 49:44.415
But I don't... I tend to work all day.

49:44.896 --> 49:55.853
But in the course of writing, I might just find it impossible, and I might pick up a book, anything, and I might read a Hemingway short story or a...

49:56.626 --> 49:58.448
or anything, or I might reread something.

49:58.689 --> 50:03.675
Now, Reynolds Price takes Sundays off, but other than that, he says he writes six days a week.

50:04.316 --> 50:06.098
I mean, do you feel guilty?

50:06.178 --> 50:15.269
I mean, does the Catholic upbringing make you feel like you've committed a sin if you don't write every day?

50:15.289 --> 50:24.661
I mean, do you really feel... I feel better if I've written something, not because of guilt, but because I've given some order for the day.

50:25.342 --> 50:26.143
And I have...

50:26.545 --> 50:50.427
uh a lot of ideas and just the setting them i know that if i haven't written something that i always have something to write and if i haven't done it that day then it might be lost so it's not to the world but to me and um so i always carry my where even when i was on this trip reading frankenstein i had a couple of short stories

50:50.778 --> 51:19.992
in my briefcase that were done but not quite right and so uh whenever when i had a an empty day and a lot of time i i took them out and then looked at them and uh and did something with them but it's uh you know it's like whittling on a stick sure spit shining a shoe is perhaps right but it's not it's not guilt it's uh i think it's a process of life it's

51:20.495 --> 51:22.258
That's a good call.

51:22.298 --> 51:24.682
It's the way I've lived my life.

51:25.463 --> 51:36.682
And there must be people, I think you could compare it with a painter who is, even when they're not painting a picture, they might be out sketching something.

51:36.702 --> 51:38.485
They might sketch something in a sketchbook.

51:39.286 --> 51:44.815
Remember the great New Yorker cartoon, the guy's in the hammock and he says, listen, the writer isn't always writing when he's writing.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.261
Yeah.

51:46.321 --> 51:47.002
It's wonderful.

51:47.583 --> 51:49.705
Wonderful.

51:49.725 --> 51:52.569
Now, just one other quick business-like question.

51:52.609 --> 51:55.592
I mean, are you in the word processor, Jim?

51:56.553 --> 51:58.155
No, no, I still write in longhand.

51:58.435 --> 52:05.283
And the first draft I write in longhand, and I often recopy it in longhand.

52:05.444 --> 52:06.685
And then I...

52:07.340 --> 52:08.962
I word process it.

52:09.002 --> 52:11.244
So there are variant drafts to what you do then?

52:11.504 --> 52:12.625
Yeah, yeah, usually three.

52:13.606 --> 52:17.891
But the initial one is always in longhand.

52:19.012 --> 52:24.578
Word processes are great for, I mean, much better than time writing.

52:24.598 --> 52:25.359
For revisions.

52:25.619 --> 52:28.502
To me, it is a kind of time writing.

52:28.602 --> 52:30.844
Although I must say, I've been using it for other things.

52:31.024 --> 52:33.567
I've got a little more...

52:34.036 --> 52:40.815
But the first book I wrote on a word processor was my Pacific book.

52:40.835 --> 52:44.084
But it's very, very convenient.

52:44.124 --> 52:48.636
I think probably at the end of the day I'm a lot less tired than when I was

52:49.223 --> 52:54.597
No, I couldn't.

52:54.617 --> 52:57.224
I turn it on in the morning.

52:57.304 --> 52:59.369
It's a regular full computer.

53:00.151 --> 53:01.956
It's on for 16 hours the whole day.

53:01.996 --> 53:04.081
I should leave it on 24 hours.

53:04.121 --> 53:05.224
What time do you have?

53:05.204 --> 53:07.809
I bought it from a guy who built it.

53:08.330 --> 53:11.575
Remember how we used to buy stereos with various components?

53:12.257 --> 53:14.260
I couldn't tell you what it is.

53:14.781 --> 53:15.823
It's various components.

53:17.266 --> 53:23.517
It's a 386 with 25 whatever things.

53:23.497 --> 53:28.188
Well, it's like an IBM, and it's got all the power and the memory of that.

53:28.909 --> 53:36.747
I have to say, for instance, this freelance thing I'm doing lately, the column, would be impossible without the computer and the modem.

53:37.233 --> 53:43.964
I mean, everything I file, I mean, it's the same basic story, which I will modify, let's say, for a Quincy thing.

53:44.004 --> 53:49.132
If you had Quincy relations, you know, if there was something really pertinent to write to that readership, I'd put it in.

53:50.074 --> 53:55.102
And I send it over the telephone, and it's in their computer in 45 seconds, you know.

53:55.122 --> 53:58.988
I don't even have to fax it, so there's no typist who can screw it up.

53:58.968 --> 54:01.311
in an interim process.

54:02.313 --> 54:10.285
So, I mean, I don't think I'd attempt it if I were not able to write it on the computer and transmit it on the computer.

54:10.485 --> 54:12.027
You know, it's a wonderful thing.

54:13.509 --> 54:14.691
Well, listen, do you have a P.O.

54:14.711 --> 54:18.357
box down there in Sandwich you'd like me to send this piece to?

54:18.637 --> 54:19.338
Wonderful, yeah.

54:19.478 --> 54:21.001
It's box 858.

54:22.523 --> 54:22.663
Uh-huh.

54:27.892 --> 54:32.720
My phone number is actually within, I'm 888-6205.

54:33.621 --> 54:35.945
So we must be neighbors.

54:35.985 --> 54:38.889
Aren't you Cloud Neck Road?

54:38.910 --> 54:41.834
Well, we're off, you know where Hammond Road is?

54:42.716 --> 54:47.503
And so we're down at the very end on Captain Hook.

54:47.523 --> 54:50.608
And we're on the ocean and we're getting battered.

54:51.429 --> 54:53.713
The town has got to let us do something here.

54:53.980 --> 54:55.923
The erosion is going to... How near the ocean are you?

54:55.943 --> 54:56.784
It's killing us.

54:56.804 --> 54:59.628
I mean, we've lost about 18 feet in the last couple of years.

54:59.648 --> 55:00.409
Are you right on it?

55:00.749 --> 55:02.752
Yeah.

55:02.792 --> 55:06.918
But it's a curse now as much as anything else because... Oh, I was down yesterday.

55:08.741 --> 55:11.344
I'm going to shut off the tape recorder now, okay?

55:12.266 --> 55:12.386
Yep.

55:12.406 --> 55:12.546
Okay.
