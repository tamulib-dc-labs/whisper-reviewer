WEBVTT

00:03.052 --> 00:03.853
I'm on again.

00:04.013 --> 00:06.936
Can you just walk in the ground floor and look at the room?

00:07.256 --> 00:15.845
That's mainly the development office over there, isn't it?

00:16.465 --> 00:18.727
Yes.

00:18.747 --> 00:21.050
I'm on again, so we can continue.

00:21.070 --> 00:25.134
Well, Dr. Ransom's idea of this treasure was to share.

00:26.515 --> 00:32.721
And one of my primaries was to let people come and select artwork.

00:33.359 --> 00:37.685
for any university facility and also the governor's office.

00:40.248 --> 00:54.969
And because these were his calling cards, they were a way of introducing us to these people and of doing them a thing which you might or might not put in later.

00:55.730 --> 01:01.898
But one of the greatest things he ever did to me was he called me at 10 o'clock the morning and said,

01:03.211 --> 01:18.375
Uh, the art department is taking pictures to the speaker of the house, to just a quarter in the Capitol building at Manacostia.

01:19.136 --> 01:20.698
And he said, can you get there before the paper?

01:20.719 --> 01:23.763
Well, I had no station wagon, so he threw about 40 pounds in the station wagon.

01:23.783 --> 01:24.865
He rushed down to the Capitol building.

01:25.385 --> 01:34.996
carried him up all those little back elevators up to the third floor, lined them up in the hall, and then had Mrs. Daniel come out and lift them.

01:35.016 --> 01:36.878
And she selected about 25, let's see.

01:37.379 --> 01:41.564
We left there about 12 or 15 dollars.

01:41.584 --> 01:43.887
But that just pleased him.

01:43.907 --> 01:46.730
He was just doing that.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.672
Apparently he was pleased by a lot of things.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.855
Now, Dave Romer finally spoke to us earlier.

01:50.935 --> 01:55.240
He was a student here, and he did a student publication.

01:55.777 --> 01:59.642
And Dr. Ranson called and said, this is wonderful.

01:59.662 --> 02:02.205
This is reminding me of something that he had done.

02:03.046 --> 02:05.490
And he said, it was like getting a call from God, you know.

02:05.650 --> 02:09.134
And he said, it was, but his enthusiasm.

02:09.275 --> 02:11.557
Did not miss anything.

02:11.598 --> 02:14.702
And apparently his enthusiasm would penetrate every level.

02:15.282 --> 02:21.370
Well, let me tell you how great his enthusiasm and sharing was.

02:21.390 --> 02:25.075
Out of this budget that she got so easily from the Board of Regents,

02:25.291 --> 02:30.644
He furnished money to all departments on campus.

02:31.125 --> 02:37.140
If the geology department wanted to set his books they couldn't afford, they'd call him and he'd buy it for him.

02:37.627 --> 03:00.698
and he had placed i worked in 1962 for the art department i was paid by the chairman of the arts department boarded me and he requested the job decisions in the arts as long as he ran from his chancellor he was giving out technology anybody who needs

03:01.049 --> 03:07.337
on Kansas, in any department, for any reason, he would find it.

03:07.357 --> 03:12.143
And if it supported the ultimate good of the HSC?

03:12.323 --> 03:14.666
It didn't matter.

03:15.907 --> 03:23.617
He knew he was anointed and he was more than willing to share it.

03:23.637 --> 03:29.043
When you say $2 million, is that for acquisitions or is that just the budget?

03:29.063 --> 03:30.004
No, that was just the budget.

03:30.024 --> 03:30.465
Just for acquisitions.

03:31.255 --> 03:41.368
And it was basically, you know what you want, or is that a question of telling them what he was getting, or just go get it, right?

03:42.049 --> 03:50.160
Well, he would always, one year, he would always do some kind of a favorite thing before, to let them know what was happening.

03:50.180 --> 03:56.148
One year, he emerged in here with a bookstore and said, all right, what have you been doing?

03:56.168 --> 03:57.429
I said, well, it's on this book.

03:57.489 --> 03:59.031
He said, okay, love him.

03:59.051 --> 04:00.233
So I quit off.

04:00.398 --> 04:05.786
Was he a dynamic person?

04:05.826 --> 04:06.687
Describe them for me.

04:06.707 --> 04:07.488
I mean, did he walk in?

04:08.049 --> 04:14.077
When I was in the Navy, we used to say a captain was really a captain if he had command presence.

04:14.097 --> 04:18.443
Oh, he walked in the room and everything.

04:18.523 --> 04:20.126
How was that?

04:20.646 --> 04:22.649
How can you describe that?

04:23.090 --> 04:24.572
Well, he was not a tall man.

04:25.373 --> 04:26.895
One, you have to give it

04:27.230 --> 04:54.469
He had a very, what is the word, melodious?

04:54.955 --> 05:06.172
It was not soft, but it was very full and mellow, and he had beautiful diction.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.997
I don't know where, but he brought in Texas.

05:10.017 --> 05:18.610
He was just born like a reincarnation of somebody.

05:18.670 --> 05:24.439
He had eyes that didn't pierce you or anything.

05:24.875 --> 05:28.859
If you got into those eyes, you didn't get out.

05:28.879 --> 05:31.321
It's like the man has done with $20,000.

05:31.341 --> 05:33.643
It really doesn't matter what he said.

05:34.384 --> 05:37.467
He said it so exquisite.

05:39.069 --> 05:43.253
He made you feel he was the most important person in the world.

05:44.554 --> 05:54.223
And he, for instance, Mrs. Hustis was always talking to janitors on one hand with the governors and that.

05:54.507 --> 06:00.114
audience to the royal presence might have it.

06:00.334 --> 06:06.322
It, of course, would have precipitated further, but it always never started.

06:06.342 --> 06:08.324
So you said, audience to the royal presence.

06:08.344 --> 06:14.312
Was this the perception that people had out here, you think, that he really was on a level?

06:15.513 --> 06:17.916
What I'm trying to say, he was not inaccessible.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.443
But people were an aww, aww, aww.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.547
I hate that word, but he was aww.

06:23.928 --> 06:26.412
He was that kind of a person.

06:26.432 --> 06:27.413
Inspired aww.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.636
Yeah, he was talking to somebody very important.

06:29.777 --> 06:34.043
On the other hand, he made you feel so important.

06:34.063 --> 06:37.368
He had something he wanted to say just to you, to nobody else.

06:38.570 --> 06:43.778
If he wanted you to go out and roll on the ground like Edward.

06:44.799 --> 06:47.363
You would have been happy to do that.

06:48.524 --> 06:51.028
Because you knew it was important for him.

06:51.188 --> 06:54.273
He didn't waste time on free-free.

06:54.794 --> 07:02.906
His idea of importance was people and treating them well so that they treated themselves well.

07:02.926 --> 07:06.472
And he also knew that he treated them well.

07:06.512 --> 07:08.575
They worked like dogs for you.

07:08.675 --> 07:10.758
And Mrs. Hussberg worked herself the best.

07:10.838 --> 07:13.182
She worked every night till midnight.

07:14.191 --> 07:15.572
She had a heart attack.

07:15.692 --> 07:21.818
The doctor told her she had one year to live, and she didn't quit work.

07:23.479 --> 07:24.921
That's when it's really .

07:25.701 --> 07:32.187
She said, well, I just want to live long enough to see Dr. .

07:32.207 --> 07:42.156
So she came over and picked up paintings for her offices, and Dr. .

07:42.575 --> 07:47.420
He'd been there three days since she was taken off the hospital again.

07:47.440 --> 07:53.186
We hung the painting she had selected over her desk, but she never saw it.

07:53.206 --> 07:53.706
She died.

07:54.627 --> 07:58.191
But he'd been in that building three days since she died.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.073
So she achieved her goal in any case.

08:00.093 --> 08:01.354
She selected the painting.

08:01.394 --> 08:03.477
It was called an offering for the day of the dead.

08:05.739 --> 08:09.022
But she never saw it.

08:09.042 --> 08:09.763
Do you have that painting?

08:10.368 --> 08:11.810
Is that maybe?

08:11.870 --> 08:15.494
No, it's not on one now, it's on the other side.

08:15.514 --> 08:21.221
And the Tom Lee Creek is Dr. Ransett, loves Dr. Ransett Creek, right?

08:21.661 --> 08:29.390
Those are his... Was he a detail man, or was he more interested in the grand scope?

08:29.771 --> 08:31.653
As I say, he was everything.

08:31.673 --> 08:37.860
He was the visionary, the organizer, the PR, the detail man.

08:38.245 --> 08:44.252
I mean, but did he pass on, like, let's say, there's a manuscript collection that a dealer might have?

08:44.772 --> 08:48.296
And we're going to talk, well, how much do we pay for it?

08:48.316 --> 08:52.861
Is this something that he would work out, or was it just important to him that we get it?

08:53.722 --> 08:55.084
He worked his hand to the box.

08:55.104 --> 08:55.384
He did.

08:55.584 --> 08:56.545
So he took care of that.

08:57.106 --> 09:02.352
But he could do it so fast, because he knew what he was talking about.

09:02.652 --> 09:04.194
He could make up his mind.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.175
He knew what he was doing.

09:05.195 --> 09:08.218
But the material, he knew the paperwork he was doing.

09:08.603 --> 09:10.225
He knew what the materials were.

09:11.527 --> 09:18.457
He could always psych out the other person who wanted to buy the collection.

09:18.878 --> 09:24.085
He could always figure out what the right price was to offer.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.327
Occasionally, we'd lose something.

09:25.347 --> 09:37.024
We lost the Pound Collection because somebody at HRC got into some kind of a hassle.

09:37.409 --> 09:47.931
So, you lost a few things.

09:48.412 --> 09:50.777
He wasn't successful in everything he did.

09:51.736 --> 10:15.587
No, not in everything, but as long as we bought all the British materials, and my favorite story is that throughout seven or eight years of this, the Crown passed the law that nothing over 75 years old could be loose in the country without the point of permission, and we've always taken this a bag of honor to direct the premier at the university.

10:15.607 --> 10:18.351
That's the second time we've read that today.

10:19.276 --> 10:24.945
Well, I've heard so many British accents today.

10:25.005 --> 10:26.868
I mean, people are here doing their research.

10:26.888 --> 10:29.012
They have to come here for things.

10:29.032 --> 10:31.476
I really feel it.

10:31.496 --> 10:32.958
But it's in a nice place.

10:33.138 --> 10:34.761
I mean, it's in a safe place.

10:34.921 --> 10:39.348
But then they've got all of Egypt in here.

10:39.368 --> 10:44.336
One of the funniest things is, you know, I'm depraising now.

10:44.356 --> 10:46.300
Let's get back to this.

10:46.320 --> 10:46.600
So, the...

10:47.238 --> 11:00.492
One of the arbitrary decisions made was whether you keep a collection together, or you divide it according to the structure.

11:00.512 --> 11:04.977
And the decision had to be made before the making of the building.

11:04.997 --> 11:11.264
Made to the site, the material, and the manuscript, the art work.

11:11.284 --> 11:15.388
And some of the objects in this renaissance, that's Edgar Allan Poe's bell on the wall.

11:16.516 --> 11:21.502
It came off of his house in Richmond, Virginia.

11:21.602 --> 11:22.924
This is Frida Kahlo.

11:23.585 --> 11:36.121
Her portrait right behind you, excuse me, that one right there, that is, well, you see, it was part of Nicholas Marais' collection.

11:36.141 --> 11:40.026
He's the great, famous American photographer living in Mexico City.

11:40.276 --> 11:50.792
Thank you.

11:51.245 --> 12:16.601
The book with Herrera from Chicago wrote, her biography really made a sense.

12:16.621 --> 12:18.183
I have a mindset purpose, I think, where it is the most famous world, I guess.

12:18.203 --> 12:19.665
We could request a week to leave the smoke up in the middle of the night.

12:20.033 --> 12:36.656
A general idea of what we have.

12:36.876 --> 12:38.258
Oh, that's the Borzoi.

12:38.378 --> 12:40.901
There it is.

12:41.102 --> 12:41.943
That's been on.

12:43.485 --> 12:45.367
This is the famous Borzoi.

12:45.868 --> 12:46.629
That's the dog.

12:46.930 --> 12:47.290
And there it

12:47.877 --> 12:49.199
And that's his own stained glass.

12:49.259 --> 12:51.141
That's his own.

12:51.682 --> 12:53.144
No, this was from his library.

12:53.564 --> 12:57.089
He said when he died, we got the remaining books.

12:57.109 --> 13:07.843
What we want to see is about from his personal library from Purchase.

13:07.863 --> 13:08.524
That was in the library.

13:08.544 --> 13:13.711
And we have all these certificates in here.

13:13.731 --> 13:17.175
And the most interesting thing in America is this top.

13:17.695 --> 13:22.525
I don't have to come up with this for 40 years and it came here with the collection.

13:23.146 --> 13:30.473
Well, part of my job is I have a student who's coming to choose unknown artworks to work on research.

13:30.874 --> 13:32.535
She built one semester research and did.

13:33.436 --> 13:35.538
She discovered it's one of five in the world.

13:36.339 --> 13:42.765
There's only one place in the world where the clay is found in this particular place in Vietnam.

13:43.085 --> 13:43.446
Really?

13:43.466 --> 13:46.489
It was made in the 15th century.

13:46.509 --> 13:51.293
Others are at the University of Hawaii, honestly.

13:51.313 --> 13:53.035
Did we figure out how South got it, I wonder?

13:53.858 --> 13:55.080
She wrote to him.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.682
He couldn't remember where he got it.

13:57.463 --> 14:01.369
But he was furious when she wrote to him because he hadn't taken his office income tax.

14:01.429 --> 14:06.055
He didn't know that it was worth anything at all, you see.

14:06.075 --> 14:09.340
It's worth about $200,000.

14:11.042 --> 14:14.427
He had it on his testimony, didn't he?

14:14.547 --> 14:15.589
Yeah, right.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.873
And these are George Bernard Shaw's kind of stuff.

14:18.934 --> 14:21.417
They had all the rest of the silver.

14:21.517 --> 14:22.819
These are cane hands.

14:23.373 --> 14:32.543
They're wonderful.

14:34.125 --> 14:38.330
They're almost like scrimshaw.

14:38.670 --> 14:44.637
Two of them are ivory, and one is shade, and one is thumbs.

14:44.657 --> 14:47.220
This is the pansy young silver.

14:47.993 --> 14:51.942
Pansy and her husband were dirt farmers in East Texas, and they moved to Houston.

14:51.962 --> 14:53.585
He bought a throwing station.

14:53.605 --> 14:55.349
Somebody said, wouldn't you like to drill?

14:56.592 --> 14:58.717
This was in the 30s.

14:58.737 --> 15:04.770
In 1939, he had made all his friends so rich that they, in commemoration and thanks,

15:05.223 --> 15:10.633
They had a complete set of everything, twelve of every pancreas, made one design only.

15:10.653 --> 15:16.986
There is no other set like it in the world for Pansy, Yaunt, and the same as the two of her memorial dinner in 1939.

15:17.006 --> 15:18.188
What do we call it?

15:18.649 --> 15:20.813
Pansy, which is Mrs. Yaunt's neck.

15:20.833 --> 15:21.434
I see.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.236
Okay.

15:22.256 --> 15:25.001
So this is the Pansy Yaunt silver collection.

15:25.021 --> 15:26.083
How do we spell the yarn?

15:26.367 --> 15:33.674
And we have the other twelve of everything in the kitchen.

15:33.714 --> 15:35.115
Yeah, we have the punch ball.

15:35.175 --> 15:41.200
We allow those to be used, too, for university trips.

15:41.561 --> 15:48.627
It's mostly, uh, but, um, I just came over with Sir Swanee Tom.

15:48.647 --> 15:53.151
He was one of the original Swedish founders of Austria in 1839.

15:53.171 --> 15:54.012
Can you imagine?

15:54.515 --> 16:01.465
My feeling is he had the only culture in Texas until about 1880.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.870
What was his name again?

16:04.890 --> 16:06.853
Sir Swanti Palm, P-A-L-M.

16:06.873 --> 16:17.809
He was not knighted until 1885 when the king of Sweden invited him back to Sweden because of his efforts on the behalf of Texas.

16:18.049 --> 16:22.075
Texas had no Swedish legation, so it did have a French legation.

16:22.747 --> 16:23.728
in Germany.

16:23.748 --> 16:26.271
These are in a Republic days, obviously, right?

16:26.291 --> 16:26.392
Yeah.

16:26.412 --> 16:37.005
It's three years after the Republic was formed, all of a sudden expanded.

16:37.025 --> 16:47.679
We couldn't imagine these things coming, artworks, musical instruments, and just potteries and, you know, .

16:47.699 --> 16:48.079
I like it.

16:49.038 --> 16:51.721
How do I just leave these?

16:52.442 --> 16:57.368
I'm going to go back to the building.

16:57.688 --> 16:58.009
Okay.

16:58.069 --> 16:59.670
I know you can find your way back to our building.

16:59.871 --> 17:01.172
So what time do you want me there?

17:01.272 --> 17:01.933
You take your time.

17:02.133 --> 17:04.616
We have our appointment with not so free.

17:04.796 --> 17:05.157
Oh, good.

17:05.177 --> 17:05.878
With Michael.

17:06.258 --> 17:08.140
Okay, wait a minute.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.403
You can probably see Dave before that.

17:10.743 --> 17:13.286
I feel right about getting back.

17:13.306 --> 17:15.789
She's wonderful.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.172
You come over too.

17:18.332 --> 17:18.893
Come in good.

17:19.531 --> 17:19.911
That's great.

17:21.053 --> 17:31.443
How many, you said that one of the inducements to getting someone like Alfred Canard to give their things would be to give them a room.

17:31.503 --> 17:35.447
How many of these rooms would you say that you have, roughly?

17:35.768 --> 17:42.795
Well, one, two, three, four, six.

17:42.915 --> 17:44.897
There were six rooms.

17:47.898 --> 17:51.262
I love that smell.

17:53.544 --> 17:54.706
Isn't that great?

17:54.726 --> 17:55.647
It's a mixture.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.889
It's a library smell.

17:59.931 --> 18:07.039
These are the seeds of literary connections, right?

18:07.139 --> 18:07.500
I'm guessing.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.402
Now, this half of the way, it's gorgeous, too.

18:09.882 --> 18:10.683
Here's a beer bomb.

18:10.743 --> 18:14.968
These are in this villa, right by there.

18:15.202 --> 18:28.462
Oh, I'm showing you two of the more interesting things.

18:28.703 --> 18:39.038
This is our only sergeant, but this is Lady of Cynthia Asquith, daughter of the Prime Minister, who is one of the works for the leaders and adventures.

18:39.439 --> 18:42.103
This was painted by Boris Pasternak's father.

18:42.691 --> 18:46.662
Leonid was 19 years old.

18:46.983 --> 18:57.292
Sarah Bernhardt was out of money in Paris, and so she cooked up this two or two, and he went down to the theater and painted it.

18:57.332 --> 18:58.455
What is the movie?

18:59.296 --> 19:16.692
This is a drawing by Oscar Wilde, a woman he hoped to marry, but she was from a very fine Douglas who thought he was not worthy.

19:16.712 --> 19:22.537
And they made her break off the engagement, and she was so curious.

19:22.838 --> 19:25.660
She demanded that she give him back the jewelry.

19:26.381 --> 19:26.641
Did he?

19:27.362 --> 19:28.543
She gave it back.

19:29.367 --> 19:36.318
Oh, she later married the future author of Dracula.

19:36.338 --> 19:36.859
Bram Stoker.

19:37.901 --> 19:39.584
Right.

19:39.604 --> 19:40.044
Yeah.

19:40.064 --> 19:45.253
Here, uh, this is Evelyn Wallen in his uniform, again, in a year during the war.

19:45.614 --> 19:46.856
Right, it's a good year.

19:48.839 --> 19:48.979
Mm-hmm.

19:49.853 --> 19:51.495
You have a wonderful walk collection.

19:51.515 --> 19:56.259
Well, you have the pre-eminent walk collection, I guess, the walk collection.

19:56.279 --> 20:00.824
Well, we never had a demonstration.

20:00.844 --> 20:01.565
She wanted to be an illuminator.

20:01.585 --> 20:03.246
John O'Hara?

20:03.266 --> 20:03.426
Right.

20:03.927 --> 20:05.268
Lots of Napoleon's here.

20:05.428 --> 20:10.053
It was like .

20:10.233 --> 20:14.978
A famous controversial portrait painting on that.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.860
To this cray mistress.

20:17.020 --> 20:17.160
Mm-hmm.

20:19.503 --> 20:24.832
And everything's been so beautifully boxed now, I can't show you anything.

20:24.853 --> 20:25.694
This is wonderful.

20:25.714 --> 20:29.601
See, well, it shows that everything is really being cataloged and processed.

20:29.621 --> 20:31.605
It's an ivory doctor doll.

20:32.486 --> 20:36.613
We have little miniatures of moon ties for him to touch my home.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.196
Portrait of Mary Lamb.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.739
For his moon ties, yeah.

20:40.107 --> 20:42.730
Look at, are these boxes made here?

20:42.750 --> 20:43.451
Yes, they are.

20:43.471 --> 20:44.953
We have a marvelous concert.

20:45.013 --> 20:45.774
Spectacular.

20:45.955 --> 20:49.179
Just as I say to him, so if we're down there, we can't see anything.

20:49.279 --> 20:52.123
That's Mum Taz and her husband.

20:53.885 --> 20:57.049
She had 13 children and died at 36.

20:57.069 --> 20:59.813
He felt so bad about it.

21:00.154 --> 21:08.705
Oh, that is, I just wrote a piece of paper.

21:08.725 --> 21:08.865
I will.

21:11.579 --> 21:40.219
Do you just ever come in here on your own and just kind of enjoy the things?

21:41.195 --> 21:49.045
Well, we have 3,000 pieces of Erich Gale.

21:49.126 --> 21:51.148
Here are some of the Erich Gale sculptures.

21:51.168 --> 21:53.091
You may recognize that.

21:53.511 --> 21:57.577
This is Erich Gale.

21:57.597 --> 22:02.163
This is a legitimate stone by Gale and others who think are done by students.

22:03.164 --> 22:06.088
David Kennersley, are you familiar with your students?

22:07.165 --> 22:08.787
has given us some beautiful work.

22:09.488 --> 22:10.469
So you know this to be Gil.

22:10.489 --> 22:11.731
Is it signed someplace?

22:11.791 --> 22:15.776
No, but it's tenderly the student verifies it.

22:15.796 --> 22:16.778
It's definitely Gil.

22:16.838 --> 22:19.601
Here's the other Gil sculptures.

22:19.942 --> 22:21.804
Eve is part of a pair.

22:21.824 --> 22:27.071
Adam is owned by the Tate Gallery, so we allowed Eve to go to London several years ago.

22:27.312 --> 22:32.919
I'll let you have Adam sometimes.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.784
Here's the famous Gil split.

22:37.895 --> 22:43.142
Here's one of them, and the other one is standing right over there.

22:44.984 --> 22:56.198
Now, the interesting thing about the Gill book, you know, has just been published, is that UCLA has a comparable collection to ours, but they have no sculpture.

22:56.218 --> 22:59.763
We have the sculpture, but no diary.

22:59.943 --> 23:02.366
They have all the diaries, and that's probably so much.

23:02.386 --> 23:03.868
And here's John Bittgenheim.

23:04.996 --> 23:30.936
uh we have a lot of fields we've got ten the queen owns the primary girl and so we were able to finish this is our twenty thousand dollars bought a car by rich illustrator edmund relax this is michael arland one of the pretty twenty thousand dollars we paid twenty thousand and we're talking about

23:31.186 --> 23:33.530
Six inches by four inches, perhaps.

23:33.550 --> 23:34.651
Right, right.

23:34.671 --> 23:39.839
Have you ever seen the previous one?

23:39.859 --> 23:40.059
No.

23:40.300 --> 23:52.117
So, when I came into the collection, there were two major paintings of collections, the Australian collection and the Western collection.

23:52.278 --> 23:56.684
In the 70s, the former director decided that he didn't want to go with them.

23:56.764 --> 23:59.809
He transferred them out, so they're now with the Australian collection.

24:00.970 --> 24:04.755
This is interesting.

24:04.775 --> 24:08.259
This is a member of the Board of Readings in 1895 and all for his liberal life.

24:10.983 --> 24:18.492
This is a beautiful little drawing of James Fenimore Cooper by John Jarvis, one of the better 19th-century painters.

24:18.512 --> 24:22.657
This is also one of the better 19th-century painters, William Edward West.

24:22.677 --> 24:23.398
That's beautiful.

24:23.418 --> 24:27.383
He went all the way to Italy to paint the portrait of Lord Byron.

24:28.578 --> 24:34.823
And at the time he was painting it, she said she thought it was disgusting.

24:35.644 --> 24:46.633
But 15 years later, she was candid and said it was the best one ever done.

24:46.653 --> 24:50.116
Some of the more significant ones.

24:50.557 --> 24:54.780
The magnificent George Bernard Shaw, I'll see the top.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.623
The top is just died within the life this time.

24:57.643 --> 24:58.163
You may know.

24:58.582 --> 25:01.086
This is really one of the finest of his portraits.

25:01.927 --> 25:02.548
Look at that.

25:03.289 --> 25:06.394
It hung out in the lobby here for 15 years.

25:07.576 --> 25:10.801
It really looks beautiful, isn't it?

25:10.821 --> 25:12.003
One of his great paintings.

25:15.328 --> 25:16.029
And this is?

25:16.770 --> 25:17.952
That's John Foster Dulles.

25:17.972 --> 25:18.713
John Foster Dulles.

25:18.894 --> 25:22.840
We have the John Foster Dulles collection.

25:22.860 --> 25:25.945
We'll start again.

25:26.005 --> 25:26.125
Right.

25:26.813 --> 25:31.560
This is Howard Kirk, one of J. Frank Dobie's favorite artists.

25:32.021 --> 25:33.863
Do you have Dobie's stuff?

25:34.043 --> 25:34.704
Oh, yes.

25:34.724 --> 25:37.428
Oh, you have Dobie's stuff?

25:37.448 --> 25:40.112
Well, if Dobie is anywhere, he'd better be in Texas, that's for sure.

25:40.132 --> 25:43.577
This is Dobie from a protestant.

25:43.597 --> 25:44.939
Dobie's the great West Wing writer.

25:46.421 --> 25:49.626
Ah, look at that.

25:51.389 --> 25:53.091
These are wonderful.

25:53.476 --> 25:56.821
This is Hemingway at the Siegfried Run by John Grosset.

25:56.841 --> 25:58.423
I know it's Hemingway reading Ulysses, right?

25:58.704 --> 25:59.785
That's right.

25:59.965 --> 26:03.010
Who are these Hirshfields just said?

26:03.731 --> 26:05.453
There's a whole series of Hirshfields.

26:05.473 --> 26:08.397
The rest of them are theater people, so they're over at theater.

26:09.579 --> 26:18.412
This is 1919 Dorothy Bratt's painting of Alice Huxley in Bloomsdale.

26:18.432 --> 26:19.213
This is a long ago.

26:19.970 --> 26:29.521
Whose idea was it to put together a literary connection art collection?

26:29.841 --> 26:31.743
I love the idea.

26:32.203 --> 26:41.354
Well, the original idea, as you do not understand, was the inventory of everything that belonged to the university was to be part of this building.

26:41.374 --> 26:42.775
That was the reason for the space.

26:42.795 --> 26:47.260
When we lost the space, we lost control over it.

26:48.168 --> 26:49.991
So did this happen as a collection?

26:50.011 --> 26:54.437
I mean, was this a focused collection from the start, or it was derived from existing collections?

26:54.518 --> 26:57.061
This was focused to include everything the university owned.

26:57.081 --> 26:58.283
I made a walk into it.

26:58.303 --> 26:59.805
I went to every office.

26:59.825 --> 27:00.667
I went to every closet.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.628
So this is your baby?

27:02.029 --> 27:03.251
Right.

27:03.351 --> 27:06.375
In the 1970s, I did the first image work.

27:06.395 --> 27:06.856
I love it.

27:07.056 --> 27:07.817
It's really wonderful.

27:07.838 --> 27:09.400
Well, that's why I love it.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.184
And that's not the only reason I love it, but I mean, it's beautiful.

27:12.991 --> 27:17.258
There was a book published by Abrams a year or two ago, The Writer's Image.

27:17.559 --> 27:20.584
Are you familiar with that book, Paintings by Writers?

27:21.044 --> 27:21.685
Doubly Gifted?

27:22.306 --> 27:23.729
Doubly Gifted.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.091
That's your book?

27:25.191 --> 27:27.235
That's my book.

27:27.255 --> 27:28.937
Would you like to have a paperback copy?

27:28.958 --> 27:31.341
I have a high brown copy.

27:31.682 --> 27:36.129
If I'd have known you were to be here, I'd have brought it for you to inscribe.

27:36.169 --> 27:37.191
How lovely.

27:37.211 --> 27:37.952
Doubly Gifted.

27:38.053 --> 27:38.914
That's your book.

27:39.097 --> 27:42.480
I didn't choose the name of the president at all.

27:42.501 --> 27:44.595
The writer's image is another book.

27:44.615 --> 27:44.736
Right.

27:45.070 --> 27:46.852
Maybe it's not the same.

27:47.594 --> 27:49.917
No, no, I know the Abelings book.

27:50.057 --> 27:51.319
I wrote about it, as a matter of fact.

27:51.339 --> 27:51.779
Oh, you did?

27:51.819 --> 27:55.985
I will send you my column on it.

27:56.005 --> 28:04.417
Isn't that... I have... I can back this up with the story, which I will send you with... If it's Writer's Image you wrote about, I'm going to send you a copy of mine.

28:04.437 --> 28:08.443
No, no, Writer's Image is a book of photographs that was published by Goldeen.

28:08.523 --> 28:09.744
Now I've got the two.

28:09.844 --> 28:10.826
About ten years ago.

28:11.927 --> 28:14.571
Your book is Doubly Gifty, which has a blue and white...

28:14.905 --> 28:15.746
Jackets.

28:15.766 --> 28:16.186
Right.

28:16.206 --> 28:17.128
Okay, we're doing great.

28:17.768 --> 28:18.789
And it's Evelyn.

28:18.809 --> 28:19.730
It was $29.95.

28:20.171 --> 28:20.972
Bless you.

28:22.173 --> 28:23.134
Am I doing better now?

28:23.274 --> 28:25.457
Oh, God, you're perfect.

28:25.557 --> 28:27.359
This is the greatest one.

28:27.379 --> 28:28.300
Now, this is 1906.

28:28.380 --> 28:29.842
This is Mom.

28:30.503 --> 28:37.090
He's roaming in Montmartre with a painting student named Gerald Kelly.

28:37.110 --> 28:37.931
Isn't it wonderful?

28:38.051 --> 28:43.117
And so, until 1965, Sir Gerald Kelly painted 15 portraits of him.

28:43.157 --> 28:44.018
We have them all.

28:44.386 --> 28:48.555
This is the first thing that I'm in my favorite.

28:48.575 --> 28:54.107
This is Larry Rivers, uh, writing about John O'Hara.

28:54.127 --> 28:55.149
That's wonderful.

28:56.311 --> 28:57.394
Isn't that spectacular?

28:57.554 --> 29:00.420
I've got a better of Larry Rivers.

29:02.105 --> 29:04.809
See, see, I didn't know I was going to be interviewing you.

29:04.829 --> 29:07.292
Had I known, I would have researched you so fully.

29:07.553 --> 29:10.817
In fact, I would have brought that book with me for you to inscribe.

29:10.837 --> 29:18.428
This is done at the Del Monte Ranch by a Swedish artist who wrote in on his horse and stage that I did.

29:21.592 --> 29:26.719
And this is Lady Adeline Morel by none other than Augustus John.

29:26.919 --> 29:28.922
This is the beautiful drawing he's ever given in.

29:32.058 --> 29:38.589
There was an interesting biography of John, by Michael Hall, who wrote the biography of Mrs. John.

29:38.669 --> 29:39.490
Oh, he's smart.

29:40.251 --> 29:44.698
He came here in red.

29:44.778 --> 29:45.820
He came close to this, y'all.

29:45.900 --> 29:50.007
Here, is Wyndham Lewis' little giant of T.S.

29:50.067 --> 29:50.428
Johnson.

29:50.468 --> 29:51.549
This is in the book.

29:51.569 --> 29:54.454
It's part of the tape they cut out.

29:55.514 --> 30:01.080
But one stormy night, Wyndham Lewis was sitting in his little London apartment, and he heard somebody in the garden.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.101
Somebody knocked on the door.

30:02.121 --> 30:03.642
It was raining cats and dogs.

30:04.423 --> 30:11.891
Somebody had jumped over the garden wall and was standing on his front steps, and they opened the door, and this little man said, I am Lauren.

30:13.292 --> 30:16.736
If that was how you meant.

30:16.976 --> 30:20.439
Everything has a story, you know.

30:20.459 --> 30:20.660
I know.

30:20.740 --> 30:23.142
Listen, I spent years researching that story, and I didn't have to believe anything.

30:23.678 --> 30:31.625
Who did the Miller portrait on top?

30:31.645 --> 30:32.606
That's very good.

30:32.626 --> 30:34.208
A man named Drummond.

30:34.228 --> 30:38.812
I don't know what he's saying.

30:40.013 --> 30:45.098
A wonderful, spookier portrait.

30:45.698 --> 30:50.563
We have his kill over at HRC, and we have his sword.

30:50.864 --> 30:59.880
And there's also another little accoutrement that says, no gentleman ever dines on the battlefield without this utensil.

30:59.940 --> 31:09.217
And inside this Jewel Hill is a little fork and a little knife that you're sitting about.

31:09.237 --> 31:09.678
They're all all right.

31:09.698 --> 31:10.600
This is extraordinary.

31:10.620 --> 31:10.780
Come on.

31:11.485 --> 31:13.809
Okay, a more interesting one.

31:13.909 --> 31:25.570
Take the world by Mr. Chow, which is a portrait of India, which is going out all around Spain and will be circling in the United States.

31:25.590 --> 31:26.651
This is really exciting.

31:26.671 --> 31:29.496
Look at these are two, I'm sorry, these are two variants of the same.

31:30.418 --> 31:31.019
Right.

31:31.139 --> 31:35.046
Once the original one of the copies, particularly Henry purchased the copy,

31:35.262 --> 31:41.734
This is from the Hanley, the famous Hanley collection.

31:42.175 --> 31:48.227
So this is one of my favorite things for our student project.

31:49.048 --> 31:55.701
This is your pride and joy, isn't it?

31:56.626 --> 31:57.967
Come on, you can admit it.

31:59.269 --> 32:02.392
Here's Edward L. Ruck-Tanker in his poncho pants.

32:05.194 --> 32:06.636
We'll get to you in a minute.

32:06.916 --> 32:12.121
If you could stand up in the weathering, yes.

32:12.481 --> 32:14.684
You want to dry yourself.

32:14.704 --> 32:18.107
Sarah Teasdale.

32:18.627 --> 32:22.431
This is Yanks, my rocky stone, isn't it?

32:24.352 --> 32:33.366
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

32:33.386 --> 32:33.706
Look at that.

32:33.726 --> 32:33.847
Right.

32:33.867 --> 32:36.130
Was that one in your book?

32:36.150 --> 32:36.250
No.

32:36.270 --> 32:37.713
I had a self-portrait.

32:37.933 --> 32:39.375
He got out of prison.

32:39.395 --> 32:43.802
He was wearing his prison clothes.

32:43.902 --> 32:45.985
Didn't you have a preface by John Uptake in that?

32:46.025 --> 32:46.366
Yes.

32:46.546 --> 32:47.928
I remember it very well.

32:50.472 --> 32:52.215
Who also is an artist of some...

32:52.448 --> 32:55.713
Well, I'm going to send you my copy of the book.

32:55.733 --> 32:59.258
He's just publishing a book, you know.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.640
It's called Just Licking.

33:00.700 --> 33:04.486
That's right.

33:04.506 --> 33:07.591
I think we have that.

33:09.834 --> 33:09.934
Yeah.

33:09.954 --> 33:10.996
Well, she hated it.

33:11.236 --> 33:13.560
She would never allow us to use it on the catalog.

33:13.580 --> 33:18.928
The last time this wild turkey ought to have been sold in New York, it's about $86,000.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.384
Is that the size of that?

33:20.404 --> 33:21.585
See, I've never seen it.

33:21.946 --> 33:24.668
That's from the elephant pool of Vegas.

33:24.688 --> 33:25.830
They say elephant.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.492
They mean the elephant.

33:28.512 --> 33:30.694
That is.

33:30.734 --> 33:33.617
This is done by Gloria Swanson.

33:33.637 --> 33:40.745
She was commissioned by the United Nations to do a decorative parent for Mother's Day.

33:40.765 --> 33:42.266
It's pretty nice, isn't it?

33:42.286 --> 33:43.407
It's not bad at all.

33:43.427 --> 33:44.969
This is James Dines.

33:45.009 --> 33:48.492
These are from Flaubert's Sages.

33:48.512 --> 33:49.253
Dr. Henry.

33:49.942 --> 33:51.044
This is A.E.

33:51.064 --> 33:58.298
Russell, George A.E., a great Irish friend of me.

33:58.318 --> 34:08.417
This is done by Gadamokishai's Uncle Gustaf, who was his prototype for Labella named Tom Lee.

34:09.059 --> 34:11.323
Isn't this nice?

34:11.343 --> 34:12.405
It's too great you can.

34:12.571 --> 34:14.674
She's exhausted.

34:14.694 --> 34:16.878
She's exhausted.

34:16.898 --> 34:17.659
Are you kidding me?

34:17.859 --> 34:22.186
We've got everything to do, isn't it?

34:22.206 --> 34:34.444
Well, we have Marla's Japanese friends in doctors, of course, but then, uh, this, uh, Everlane's face, uh, about the notorious foragers, uh, Elmer Duhari.

34:34.778 --> 34:41.328
Uh, he forged, uh, he claims to have at least 300 pegs and two of Picassos in American dreams.

34:41.368 --> 34:41.849
Right.

34:42.089 --> 34:45.334
Well, this is what he was doing before he was doing his forgery.

34:45.354 --> 34:46.315
This is not a forgery.

34:46.476 --> 34:47.938
No, this is what he was trying to do.

34:47.958 --> 34:49.540
Why didn't he just stick to his regular art?

34:49.560 --> 34:50.021
That's right.

34:50.041 --> 34:51.403
Well, because it wasn't selling.

34:51.569 --> 35:05.470
When he fell into it very gently, and everyone loves him, and no one would prosecute him, and no one would give up their family.

35:07.373 --> 35:08.916
Give me his name once more slowly.

35:09.036 --> 35:16.708
Elmir, E-L-M-I-R, Duh, Horace, H-O-R-Y.

35:16.728 --> 35:19.011
And it's Irving Wallace's book called Fake.

35:19.261 --> 35:19.942
That's the one.

35:20.082 --> 35:21.003
Okay.

35:21.023 --> 35:21.343
Okay.

35:21.683 --> 35:23.645
We have some nice little ear herbs.

35:23.665 --> 35:28.529
He was a friend of Tom Lee, a friend of J. Frank Dobie's.

35:28.549 --> 35:30.571
Didn't he do some book illustration to Frank?

35:31.152 --> 35:32.233
For Dobie?

35:32.253 --> 35:33.554
I don't know about for Dobie.

35:33.654 --> 35:34.935
No, not for Dobie.

35:34.955 --> 35:37.697
But they were friends and they exchanged things.

35:37.718 --> 35:39.799
These are the gorgeous Frank Papay.

35:40.020 --> 35:43.022
The ring of fondles, the dragon, and the whirlwind of this one.

35:43.042 --> 35:45.645
What is the, again, what is the medium here?

35:45.825 --> 35:46.065
Waterfall.

35:46.085 --> 35:47.226
There's a white hole.

35:47.560 --> 35:56.962
Can you imagine anybody, anybody, the English or the British can handle waterfalls.

35:57.884 --> 35:58.085
Nobody.

35:58.466 --> 35:59.007
They're just genius.

35:59.027 --> 36:00.029
I can't believe that.

36:00.150 --> 36:03.237
I'll show you another when you won't believe it's even prettier than that.

36:03.257 --> 36:05.222
You can't make a mistake when you're doing a water color.

36:05.282 --> 36:06.244
I mean, it's one shot.

36:07.692 --> 36:08.553
Dorothy Bratt.

36:08.633 --> 36:12.597
This is all of them at the ranch, including Susan Macau.

36:12.617 --> 36:21.125
That's the little Del Monte Ranch, 1926, and Lawrence made the friends.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.848
I love this place.

36:24.188 --> 36:25.029
So much fun.

36:25.049 --> 36:26.150
Now, here's Resurrection.

36:27.151 --> 36:33.337
He painted it after he got back to the villa in Italy, but he felt he'd had a resurrection in New Mexico.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.599
And this is either- This is Lawrence?

36:35.659 --> 36:36.720
Dorothy Bratt, right.

36:37.004 --> 36:41.028
But if you look quite carefully, you see that he's painted out the red beard.

36:41.068 --> 36:49.237
The people in Taos used to call him a fox in Spanish, you know, with the words followed out of the messages for his beard.

36:49.317 --> 36:51.840
This is either— But why did he paint it out, I wonder?

36:53.281 --> 36:59.047
Oh, I think he didn't want it to be self-portrait, which it is.

36:59.067 --> 36:59.207
Okay.

37:00.208 --> 37:03.552
This is his favorite painting in the whole world called Rick Cameron.

37:03.903 --> 37:07.812
the Boccaccio story that was seized in the war and rape for obscenity.

37:07.832 --> 37:14.647
It's a Mercedes test about the shepherd who takes care of the needs of the young ladies all day in the convent.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.473
And the last line of Boccaccio's story

37:17.875 --> 37:23.483
He's lying in the shepherd, and Mother Superior comes by and says, and now my son, it's my turn.

37:26.206 --> 37:27.208
He adored this.

37:27.228 --> 37:34.818
He wrote, weeping, sad letters about, never, when the police had this, they were supposed all the paintings would have been burned.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.060
Whose painting is this again?

37:36.080 --> 37:36.280
D.H.

37:36.300 --> 37:36.521
Lawrence.

37:36.541 --> 37:36.941
That's D.H.

37:36.961 --> 37:37.362
Lawrence's as well.

37:37.382 --> 37:44.912
The only reason the paintings were not burned was that Lady Adeline Morrell stood up in the back of the courtroom and shook her umbrella and said,

37:45.263 --> 37:49.647
The only person in this room that should be burned is the judge.

37:49.667 --> 37:54.092
You can really see the parallels, can't you, between the writing and the art, can't you?

37:54.112 --> 37:55.253
I can't, can't you?

37:55.273 --> 37:59.397
I mean, that's Lawrence, without any question, without ever having seen it.

37:59.417 --> 38:00.658
Let's be very calm here.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.461
I want you to know, this is Charlotte Brompton.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.383
Can't you see Charlotte Brompton?

38:06.464 --> 38:07.905
Without any question.

38:07.925 --> 38:09.347
There she is.

38:09.367 --> 38:12.150
I mean, this is her landscape.

38:12.170 --> 38:14.612
This is the quiet woman.

38:15.487 --> 38:21.234
And what kind of woman painted this?

38:21.254 --> 38:25.579
The inventor of the Cupid doll.

38:25.599 --> 38:26.761
Rose O'Neill.

38:29.384 --> 38:33.329
And this is called My Peevish Little Thorn.

38:33.869 --> 38:38.174
My Peevish Little Thorn.

38:38.295 --> 38:39.756
Look at the woman and the fawn.

38:39.776 --> 38:43.621
I mean, you wonder what creative voices produce that piece.

38:43.641 --> 38:45.223
I like kitsch.

38:46.891 --> 38:53.641
Now, these are William Blake's.

38:53.661 --> 38:55.424
That's the parable of the sower.

38:56.446 --> 38:59.751
I saw some Blake's going to sell these a couple of weeks ago.

39:01.914 --> 39:03.356
This is another QB doll.

39:03.617 --> 39:09.686
This is George Hirschman.

39:09.706 --> 39:13.352
This is really a wonderful collection.

39:13.492 --> 39:14.233
It really is.

39:14.373 --> 39:15.615
It really is.

39:15.815 --> 39:21.683
I'm devoted to writers, and any expression that— Well, this is Cummings during his cubistic period.

39:21.743 --> 39:26.429
Can't you see him going to Paris and seeing the cubist pennies in English?

39:26.449 --> 39:28.552
He gave me influence, too.

39:28.572 --> 39:33.218
And this is Cummings, Paris, 1926, when he was a correspondent for Dial 19.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.962
Which has Worcester connections, by the way.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.325
The fellow who ran the dial was Thayer.

39:38.365 --> 39:38.706
Thayer.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.288
He married his wife.

39:40.308 --> 39:41.770
He was a Worcester knight, yeah.

39:41.790 --> 39:44.353
He left it off at the Metropolitan Museum of Life.

39:44.637 --> 39:48.143
because they're sliding them with a bad review.

39:48.904 --> 39:49.084
Oh, cool.

39:49.104 --> 39:52.449
I guess I know how that works.

39:52.469 --> 39:53.731
All right, now, here's one.

39:53.811 --> 39:55.294
Here's another watercolor.

39:55.314 --> 39:56.716
Can you believe it?

39:56.736 --> 39:57.818
No, I can't believe it.

39:57.838 --> 40:02.545
William Russell Flint, Judith, with the head of Holofun in it.

40:02.565 --> 40:06.491
How can you get that kind of... I didn't know that kind of detail was possible in watercolor, really.

40:06.692 --> 40:10.037
I'll show you one you're not going to break when you get back to the line.

40:10.793 --> 40:20.843
Uh, this is Buckle, a Tennessee Williams doll, drawn by Hannah Moynihan on her stationery during the filming of the Rose Pack 2.

40:20.863 --> 40:23.866
Oh, my goodness.

40:23.886 --> 40:26.528
You must have some Tennessee Williams things, because he dabbled.

40:26.989 --> 40:27.790
Yeah, of course, yeah.

40:27.810 --> 40:39.501
This is 18th century armadillo, drawn by great British artists in the 18th century, Hallett.

40:40.088 --> 40:42.091
Where did he get the land of Jell-O?

40:42.671 --> 40:47.497
That's the question.

40:49.740 --> 40:54.506
This is the way Jeff Portman.

40:54.526 --> 41:01.515
Denning Rowan in 47, someone spoke with the University of Dallas at the Marlboro Film Theater.

41:01.535 --> 41:02.496
47's pretty early, I mean.

41:02.516 --> 41:05.640
He was riding a playtime for poker tonight.

41:05.924 --> 41:15.033
And then when I was sitting in the room, I would open up and get the name.

41:15.053 --> 41:19.678
And then, you know, what was this?

41:19.698 --> 41:21.240
It came to the name of the church.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.661
It's to speak there.

41:22.681 --> 41:23.142
All right.

41:23.162 --> 41:28.687
This is Deborah Biddington.

41:28.707 --> 41:28.948
Whoops, sir.

41:28.968 --> 41:30.749
Covered desk jacket for Pennsylvania.

41:30.769 --> 41:31.290
This is Persian, probably

41:31.743 --> 41:38.813
This is painted by John Foster Dollar.

41:39.133 --> 41:44.661
That's not fair.

41:44.982 --> 41:54.315
This is, for Tennessee, this is kind of juvenile, though.

41:54.435 --> 41:58.741
I've seen better things by Tennessee Williams than that.

41:58.781 --> 41:59.302
That's early.

41:59.322 --> 42:00.163
That's 1947.

42:00.397 --> 42:13.994
That's really quite nice up there, that tree.

42:14.235 --> 42:28.092
There's no ashwaggle in town.

42:29.303 --> 42:31.126
This is D'Medici.

42:31.907 --> 42:33.890
Ferdinando D'Medici.

42:33.910 --> 42:52.296
Actually, we're running out of D'Medici.

42:52.756 --> 42:56.121
That's kind of nice, isn't it?

42:56.287 --> 43:00.513
That was a gift to John Bustadale, to commemorate some great tragedy.

43:00.533 --> 43:06.002
I think it's the Chinese center of Japan during the Great Depression.

43:06.022 --> 43:06.603
I'm not sure.

43:07.083 --> 43:08.025
I have a new one.

43:08.746 --> 43:12.411
I'll listen to him, but I can't read it.

43:12.431 --> 43:16.978
A paper-related counselor for Martin Luther King.

43:16.998 --> 43:21.585
In the 1930s, he began doing Calendars IV, III, and IX, and II.

43:21.987 --> 43:26.294
and became world famous for his dad, of course.

43:26.314 --> 43:34.446
He's known for his, his, his, and, uh, fabulous.

43:34.466 --> 43:38.532
I was going to, um, uh, these are Buck Sheehy's.

43:38.552 --> 43:39.995
Marvelous.

43:40.015 --> 43:40.355
This is right.

43:40.415 --> 43:44.742
This is Texas, but it's really nice to know.

43:44.762 --> 43:44.822
Um,

43:45.697 --> 43:56.570
I think we're just wearing that.

43:58.993 --> 44:11.248
I'd like to see Alfred Croft's room if we have a chance.

44:11.718 --> 44:13.461
There's 550 right in there, right?

44:14.022 --> 44:24.180
Mr. Ransom, Dr. Ransom lost my sister.

44:24.260 --> 44:31.673
I know, I know, I know.

44:32.294 --> 44:33.175
Lou Feldman?

44:33.195 --> 44:36.561
I know, Lou Feldman was in New York.

44:37.013 --> 44:41.600
Do you work with anybody else in New York?

44:41.800 --> 44:53.516
Or is it pretty much Luke Feldman, I guess, Luke Feldman?

44:53.536 --> 44:54.558
There are others.

44:54.638 --> 44:55.639
I don't know.

44:58.423 --> 45:04.472
But he was almost like the New York...

45:04.823 --> 45:15.260
What room is this?

45:15.280 --> 45:20.067
The whole room?

45:20.187 --> 45:23.012
Yes.

45:23.032 --> 45:26.978
This is the whole room?

45:27.239 --> 45:27.740
No.

45:27.760 --> 45:30.965
How many in this room?

45:30.985 --> 45:31.185
About six.

45:32.954 --> 45:44.669
And the director would be who it is.

45:44.869 --> 45:59.828
He had to go personally to get those perspectives.

46:00.248 --> 46:01.830
His wife,

46:02.654 --> 46:06.561
You were there?

46:07.202 --> 46:08.243
Yes.

46:08.404 --> 46:24.831
Hold this.

46:25.942 --> 46:31.408
And it's just as I was reading, she said, she said, I was killing myself.

46:31.509 --> 46:36.334
He's driving in here every day at that time.

46:37.856 --> 46:42.061
And she said, I'm making him close this thing.

46:42.081 --> 46:44.644
And she said, I have, I'm giving you this.

46:44.664 --> 46:46.026
It's in a good shape.

46:46.046 --> 46:54.776
She said, I've just refused him off of $30,000 for it from a movie director who wanted to use it in the 1930s.

46:54.796 --> 46:55.797
I'm giving it to you.

46:56.587 --> 46:58.230
And this is the car sharing market.

46:58.250 --> 47:04.279
It used to be 20 by 20, but every Thursday night, for 40 minutes, they had a little bit of a job.

47:04.299 --> 47:13.614
If you had the stalls to come, if you were a different ranger, and you thought you'd be important enough, you could just show up on Thursday night.

47:13.714 --> 47:16.619
And so they had one for... This was in New York or in Purchase?

47:16.639 --> 47:17.721
No, this is in Puerto Rico.

47:17.741 --> 47:19.043
This is in New York, okay.

47:19.063 --> 47:23.590
And you look at this bag in there, and you're right around the corner of the garage.

47:24.582 --> 47:35.053
And Robert John Libby has specially designed this blonde furniture for Blanche.

47:35.073 --> 47:45.945
So, as we were leaving, Helen said, wait just a minute, and she opened the fast closet.

47:45.965 --> 47:46.465
She's calling me here.

47:46.485 --> 47:47.907
It's a plastered copy of the Nefertiti.

47:48.106 --> 47:49.528
It's in the building again.

47:49.969 --> 47:51.310
She said, here, take it.

47:51.491 --> 47:54.395
Everyone says it looks just like Blanche.

47:54.415 --> 47:56.738
And I'm standing there.

47:56.758 --> 48:00.143
But of course I didn't take it.

48:00.163 --> 48:03.747
But she was getting rid of everything.

48:03.768 --> 48:05.290
Now, is this called the Croft Room?

48:06.071 --> 48:08.394
Alfred A. and Blanche.

48:08.674 --> 48:09.335
Okay.

48:10.457 --> 48:12.640
But you see, this is a functional room.

48:12.660 --> 48:14.282
You're not wasting space here at all.

48:14.903 --> 48:15.784
You're using this for

48:16.439 --> 48:19.863
Yeah, the books blend into the room.

48:19.883 --> 48:23.887
This is Kyrielle G. Bond's portrait of G. Bond.

48:23.907 --> 48:28.992
And Knopf used to come once a year to see this story.

48:29.413 --> 48:31.355
He used to come see it.

48:31.475 --> 48:34.118
Once a year, he'd come to see it.

48:34.138 --> 48:35.219
He was, you know, he worked real.

48:35.379 --> 48:37.441
This is May 1920, the G. Bond.

48:37.461 --> 48:40.084
And he used to say, I never had a best job.

48:40.638 --> 48:58.640
Well, this is in the 186th century, the process.

48:58.660 --> 49:03.165
It's the first edition of Matthew King.

49:03.185 --> 49:03.826
Have you ever had a best seller?

49:03.846 --> 49:04.547
I want you to come and look for it.

49:04.567 --> 49:05.227
I want you to stay in the doctor.

49:05.247 --> 49:05.448
Thank you.

49:05.468 --> 49:05.768
Thank you.

49:07.992 --> 49:31.004
Do you think that this is a portrait or a photograph?

49:31.024 --> 49:31.445
This is a photograph.

49:31.465 --> 49:32.126
Well, I tied for you, you did it.

49:32.146 --> 49:32.566
I think I have proof.

49:32.586 --> 49:33.087
You tell me what you see.

49:33.107 --> 49:33.768
Doesn't it look good, doesn't it?

49:33.788 --> 49:33.848
No.

49:36.629 --> 49:59.113
When about with this photograph taken?

49:59.133 --> 49:59.573
It's like a young man.

49:59.594 --> 49:59.914
Really?

49:59.934 --> 50:03.818
What would you say the value of a personal library is?

50:04.118 --> 50:09.503
to scholars, or is it really something that's great to all of them?

50:09.523 --> 50:10.684
I wonder.

50:10.704 --> 50:13.327
Well, it's not all.

50:13.407 --> 50:22.895
It's all the significant literature published between the 1925 and 1965, let's say.

50:24.037 --> 50:31.003
But it also has a small collection of rare books, and I really don't know how old they are.

50:32.654 --> 50:39.744
Well, my guess is that he's the number one in Steve Begum, the American publisher of the 20th century, when you're looking at his own.

50:39.764 --> 50:43.048
Well, it's just how do you gauge how many millions?

50:43.068 --> 50:44.170
That's right.

50:44.190 --> 50:46.553
Oh, here is the old Stanley Gardner study.

50:46.633 --> 50:56.687
My God, they took a little... He's in his first, when he was 20, I had two black men in the community.

50:57.663 --> 50:59.005
He started out in the gym.

50:59.045 --> 51:00.487
He wanted to be a boxer.

51:01.167 --> 51:08.116
And one night an attorney jumped on him and said he didn't have a license and he had no right to be doing this and he had to give it up.

51:08.216 --> 51:14.665
And he was so impressed he'd met his mind at 18 and he was going to be a lawyer instead of a boxer.

51:14.685 --> 51:15.265
So he became a lawyer.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.688
Della Street became his secretary in his 20s.

51:17.708 --> 51:20.672
He was 28 when he wrote his first story.

51:21.213 --> 51:23.996
He stopped practicing law when he was 35.

51:24.017 --> 51:25.999
Della Street saved him 45 years.

51:26.485 --> 51:29.750
She married and had a daughter, but it didn't work out.

51:29.810 --> 51:37.040
She went back to Oakland and the wife died six months before she did, and he married Della Street.

51:37.060 --> 51:41.186
I didn't know Della Street was a real person.

51:41.207 --> 51:42.749
Jane Bethel, her picture's a real person.

51:43.410 --> 51:51.782
Now, he had the court arrest resort, which was a radio program, and they would air the cases of people who claimed they'd been in jail, but asked them.

51:52.263 --> 51:55.227
And he then managed to get the view of them out of prison.

51:56.388 --> 51:57.590
The audience would write in.

51:58.531 --> 51:59.854
This is like the Smithsonian here.

51:59.934 --> 52:01.196
That's where he is.

52:01.656 --> 52:04.481
There was a tape recording describing everything in here.

52:05.082 --> 52:07.566
He corresponded with Marlene Dietrich.

52:07.966 --> 52:15.619
That little brown creature to the rise carrying what looks like a parasol at the swim show is the god of futility.

52:15.719 --> 52:19.825
He rides his donkey backwards because he doesn't care where he's going.

52:22.429 --> 52:23.391
Look at this phone.

52:23.624 --> 52:33.495
That hat hanging on this side up here is crossed with an ash, blasting by a 97-year-old Indian, whom he was able to pray for prison.

52:33.515 --> 52:38.481
He'd been in prison for 20 years, so murder did not commit.

52:38.601 --> 52:40.363
I think this is nice, you know.

52:40.483 --> 52:43.606
I mean, people who knocked this should come and see it.

52:43.626 --> 52:47.691
Now, I'm sure that he made most of his own arrows on his great helmet.

52:48.295 --> 52:50.117
He invented the counter.

52:50.137 --> 52:51.458
I have photographs of him.

52:51.538 --> 52:55.882
He took the model tape, cut the back off, and put this big box on it.

52:55.902 --> 52:56.983
It was the first camera.

52:57.044 --> 52:58.004
This was about 19.

52:58.024 --> 53:00.187
Is this the actual wood paneling from his place?

53:00.807 --> 53:01.688
No, it's recreated.

53:01.748 --> 53:06.813
It's also three-quarter scale, but you can't tell it from you.

53:06.833 --> 53:11.738
It's beautifully put back together by the color photographs that his nephew took of the room.

53:12.459 --> 53:17.003
This room was added to his ranch to make him a Californian.

53:17.202 --> 53:20.290
It was connected by a hall, 12 feet long.

53:20.731 --> 53:23.979
I've seen pictures of it lined with books on both sides.

53:25.242 --> 53:26.565
And he had guest houses.

53:26.585 --> 53:28.891
He was always entertaining.

53:28.951 --> 53:34.485
He loved to go down to Boja Peninsula with the screens when there were no roads in the middle too.

53:35.714 --> 53:37.776
I think that's why his wife went back to bed.

53:37.796 --> 53:39.417
He didn't do his writing at that desk?

53:39.437 --> 53:39.758
Yes.

53:39.778 --> 53:41.559
With all those curios on it, you think?

53:41.900 --> 53:42.100
Oh!

53:42.721 --> 53:46.324
He kept any secretary's days and transcribed in his text.

53:46.344 --> 53:46.744
Geez.

53:46.884 --> 53:48.406
He had a tape recorder in his car.

53:48.546 --> 53:49.367
I read his diary.

53:49.607 --> 53:50.968
Is this how he did his writing, then?

53:51.148 --> 53:52.109
He dictated it?

53:52.129 --> 53:53.731
Well, you know, he practiced the house.

53:53.911 --> 53:55.733
I mean, he must have been.

53:56.153 --> 53:58.695
He never stopped talking.

53:58.715 --> 54:04.641
In his diary, he said he fell into a ditch and had a flat tire, and while he was waiting for the record, he wrote a story.

54:05.397 --> 54:09.243
Look at this stuff.

54:09.263 --> 54:11.766
But he was always being honored for his work.

54:11.866 --> 54:12.788
He was excited.

54:13.489 --> 54:16.773
He was probably a member of the bar.

54:16.793 --> 54:18.516
He was a student in the United States.

54:19.497 --> 54:22.382
This is his study companion who ran the range for him.

54:22.402 --> 54:23.984
I've forgotten his name now.

54:24.004 --> 54:25.967
But Del Street is Gene Bethel.

54:26.768 --> 54:27.629
He's right here.

54:28.450 --> 54:31.615
Dorger died two months before the study opened.

54:31.635 --> 54:34.459
It was Gene Bethel came.

54:36.295 --> 54:41.922
I wanted to give a gift to my pathologist, which was this, but they wouldn't let me.

54:41.942 --> 54:50.914
And so when she came, we let her inside, and it was a very poignant moment, and she stood there and sang the desk, and she said, wow.

54:51.635 --> 54:53.277
She said, it was never this neat.

54:53.497 --> 54:55.740
I'm just reading this little thing on the wall.

54:55.900 --> 54:59.425
It was Earl Stanley Gardner with trophies presented him like pocketbooks.

54:59.825 --> 55:02.809
When one million of his books had been sold, then five million,

55:03.076 --> 55:09.005
and then 50 million, and then 100 million copies of those books.

55:09.025 --> 55:10.708
But that was 30 years ago, you knew that.

55:10.728 --> 55:12.811
Yeah, books that happened, my God.

55:15.075 --> 55:17.739
That's boggling, yeah.

55:17.899 --> 55:19.502
Without question, without question.

55:21.585 --> 55:25.371
Cultural and social as well as whatever else.

55:27.865 --> 55:41.519
Well, he was constantly being invited by police departments all over the country to help them solve their cases in exchange for which they would allow him to go to this theater.

55:42.099 --> 55:46.704
He had 250 notebooks, plot outlines.

55:46.724 --> 55:53.451
That is except one page for a plot outline, 250 notebooks, and that's how many stories he came to write.

55:54.460 --> 55:58.647
These are all badges which make him honorary sheriffs and chiefs of police.

55:59.329 --> 56:06.922
And there's Wichita, and there's Harris County from Houston, and there's a license to carry concealed firearms.

56:06.962 --> 56:08.104
There you go.

56:08.224 --> 56:10.228
Look at that frame.

56:10.248 --> 56:10.949
Isn't that wonderful?

56:11.149 --> 56:11.450
Wonderful.

56:11.470 --> 56:13.313
He's very proud of that.

56:13.563 --> 56:23.356
But see, he did a lot of things they liked, just by airing it, by television, and all the different ones you hear, all his books.

56:23.496 --> 56:26.300
Very nice first editions, I can see, with nice best jackets.

56:26.961 --> 56:28.323
Are these his own books, or are these?

56:29.725 --> 56:30.966
Yes.

56:31.087 --> 56:39.638
He sent us, there were 600 cardboard boxes that came full of scrapbooks, photographs, everything he ever owned was here.

56:39.955 --> 56:42.739
This is copy number 50 million of a pocketbook edition.

56:42.759 --> 56:44.701
Oh, that's just one book.

56:44.721 --> 56:46.944
That book alone sells 50 million.

56:46.964 --> 56:51.690
The title of that book is The Case of the Lonely Heiress, 25 cents, pocketbook.

56:56.877 --> 56:57.398
My God.

56:58.680 --> 57:07.611
To Earl Stanley Garden of the world's most widely read-off, whose sales and pocketbook editions have surpassed 100 million copies, pocketbook since January 1962.

57:08.272 --> 57:09.574
It says...

57:11.326 --> 57:11.806
Wow.

57:14.789 --> 57:15.730
That's really something.

57:19.394 --> 57:19.714
Yeah.

57:20.555 --> 57:21.416
This is nice.

57:21.636 --> 57:22.517
I'm sorry.

57:22.737 --> 57:29.103
There's an F-8 Navy Crusader.

57:29.123 --> 57:30.284
I'm an old aircraft carrier.

57:30.364 --> 57:31.726
I know the aircraft.

57:32.426 --> 57:33.027
This is nice.

57:33.407 --> 57:33.928
I like this.

57:34.568 --> 57:36.090
Well, I like it too.

57:36.110 --> 57:36.430
I mean, why not?

57:36.450 --> 57:39.493
Well, you know, I'm going to shut this off and say this.

57:40.013 --> 57:51.210
Let me tell you just one more story.

57:51.791 --> 57:54.395
How he became famous as a lawyer.

57:54.415 --> 57:56.758
He had no clients, of course, when he hung up a shingle.

57:56.779 --> 57:58.101
He was about 20 years old.

57:58.882 --> 58:02.888
But at that time, the Chinese laborers were really having a rough time.

58:03.509 --> 58:08.957
They decided to go on strike, so the employers had warrants out for all their reds in this day.

58:09.697 --> 58:12.721
So he thought, oh, they're going to subpoena them all to the poet.

58:13.481 --> 58:16.285
So Gardner thought this story up.

58:16.345 --> 58:19.709
So the next one, the officers came and they knocked on him.

58:19.829 --> 58:21.731
So Mr. Wu and opened it.

58:22.812 --> 58:25.435
There was no Mr. Wu, they were just Lings.

58:25.455 --> 58:28.759
The Lings, the Wu's had all gone to the Lings House.

58:28.779 --> 58:36.328
And he'd had this whole community shift houses so that the subpoena officers couldn't get their hands on any of them.

58:36.848 --> 58:50.679
This room is the public cell.

58:50.840 --> 58:55.330
Look at this.

58:55.867 --> 59:02.954
Mr. Hustle was an entrepreneur of sorts in Vogueville, and Esther was seen in light opera.

59:02.974 --> 59:06.418
They met in Chicago on the circuit, married.

59:06.438 --> 59:07.639
He came back to Texas.

59:07.659 --> 59:09.001
He bought one movie theater.

59:09.621 --> 59:13.445
Eventually, he owned all the movie theaters.

59:13.465 --> 59:15.187
We saw his things over in the theater arts.

59:15.367 --> 59:15.528
Right.

59:15.688 --> 59:19.512
This is the tail end of our screenwriter's exhibition.

59:19.532 --> 59:24.557
This is Doris Watson's pinion.

59:25.735 --> 59:27.317
This is Esther's portrait.

59:27.397 --> 59:32.304
This is a replica of a ring in their home in Dallas.

59:32.324 --> 59:34.768
This is the painted wallpaper.

59:34.788 --> 59:36.610
I was going to ask if that's the same wallpaper.

59:36.751 --> 59:39.995
No, it was copied, exactly, in Hong Kong.

59:40.015 --> 59:40.416
Is it silk?

59:40.436 --> 59:41.277
It's on the shelf there.

59:41.297 --> 59:41.437
Right.

59:42.218 --> 59:48.247
These are gibbons, carvings from the 17th century.

59:48.307 --> 59:53.775
He was Christopher Wrens of Houston, who restored London at the break by 16th century.

59:53.795 --> 59:55.557
She's a lovely woman, wasn't she?

59:55.655 --> 59:56.636
It's lovely.

59:56.656 --> 59:57.657
Look at this piece.

59:57.737 --> 59:59.279
Look at this extraordinary piece.

59:59.359 --> 01:00:02.442
I mean, this is not scary.

01:00:02.662 --> 01:00:04.244
It's still extraordinary.

01:00:04.264 --> 01:00:08.609
It's scary in Hong Kong.

01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:12.833
It's given to us by Mrs. Duvall, who was a member of the border region.

01:00:12.853 --> 01:00:15.476
Her father was an importer exporter.

01:00:16.717 --> 01:00:17.438
The Texas people?

01:00:18.019 --> 01:00:21.342
Yes, Long Beach.

01:00:22.722 --> 01:00:27.510
There isn't, there's no room there just because you don't have the... Well, it's here.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:28.251
This is nice.

01:00:28.511 --> 01:00:34.260
The floor, I know, but we've put it here because of the wallpaper.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.783
It doesn't go with the chipping day.

01:00:36.304 --> 01:00:39.929
This is, this is ours for my days on Mrs. Hobbesville.

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:42.433
This is a real chipping day.

01:00:42.453 --> 01:00:47.802
And Mrs. Hobbesville Foundation was here last week and they said, what are the contents of this?
