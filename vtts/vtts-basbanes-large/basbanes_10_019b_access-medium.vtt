WEBVTT

00:03.777 --> 00:04.478
How do you feel?

00:05.219 --> 00:05.961
Everything's over.

00:06.161 --> 00:07.403
Two very minor pieces.

00:09.026 --> 00:09.126
Yeah.

00:09.146 --> 00:10.869
It wasn't bad, particularly for the times.

00:10.929 --> 00:11.750
I think it went fine.

00:12.191 --> 00:14.094
Any regrets there?

00:14.114 --> 00:14.394
No.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.780
I mean, I know some of the people who left them, and I know that they're going to take good care.

00:18.321 --> 00:19.963
Who was Joseph crying for, I wonder?

00:20.244 --> 00:20.925
I don't know.

00:21.293 --> 00:23.575
I'm wondering whether he was handling Getty.

00:24.056 --> 00:24.516
You think so?

00:24.717 --> 00:29.502
Since Max wasn't fitting on those, I thought baby Joseph was handling Getty, but I don't know.

00:29.522 --> 00:34.767
But I noticed he's working with Jim Collins, who— I don't know if Dick— Who does that a lot.

00:34.787 --> 00:36.068
Yeah, but he represents Dick Manny.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.131
I don't know if Manny's into Bynies or not.

00:38.231 --> 00:39.772
Could be somebody here.

00:40.453 --> 00:42.415
That's interesting, but you don't know.

00:42.435 --> 00:47.200
Yeah, well, since Max wasn't fitting, I wonder whether Getty was even in on those.

00:47.602 --> 00:50.665
Are you confident they're going to good new homes?

00:50.965 --> 00:52.046
I'll find out real soon.

00:52.166 --> 00:52.747
You will, huh?

00:52.767 --> 00:52.987
Sure.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.669
You expect to talk to the people?

00:54.909 --> 00:57.672
I'll talk to Dave Grass afterwards, sure.

00:58.673 --> 01:05.079
Beforehand, it wouldn't be appropriate for him to tell me anything, but now he can tell me whatever the person will let him tell me.

01:05.159 --> 01:08.782
Once I figured out who you were, I watched to look for expression.

01:08.802 --> 01:13.987
I've never really observed an individual who owns a major collection like this.

01:14.007 --> 01:14.968
What was my expression like?

01:15.549 --> 01:16.630
It was stolen.

01:16.981 --> 01:17.962
You were very good.

01:18.123 --> 01:19.244
It was cool, right?

01:19.284 --> 01:20.306
So what were you feeling?

01:21.167 --> 01:25.854
Well, I was really wondering what the jewelry bindings were going to bring.

01:26.155 --> 01:28.398
I was very interested in that.

01:28.859 --> 01:31.502
The miniatures went extremely well, I thought.

01:31.522 --> 01:32.304
Important miniatures.

01:32.945 --> 01:34.507
So there were a lot of miniature collectors.

01:34.988 --> 01:37.571
This set a new record for jewelry boxes.

01:37.591 --> 01:37.972
This did?

01:38.052 --> 01:38.793
Oh, yeah.

01:38.953 --> 01:39.354
Oh, yeah.

01:39.374 --> 01:41.117
They never sold one for $150,000.

01:41.177 --> 01:43.140
But this is the best one ever made.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.522
Right.

01:44.542 --> 01:45.503
You're going to miss it?

01:45.905 --> 01:47.208
Oh, not really.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.991
No, I told you I'm fine.

01:49.071 --> 01:49.793
I'm really fine.

01:49.813 --> 01:51.777
If you don't miss something, you should not do it.

01:52.138 --> 01:52.599
That's right.

01:52.899 --> 01:53.801
Move on to the next thing.

01:53.821 --> 01:54.483
That's good.

01:54.503 --> 01:54.663
Yeah.

01:54.923 --> 01:58.631
Well, you didn't have a number, so you were tempted to get any other stuff back.

01:59.433 --> 01:59.914
Not a lot.

01:59.934 --> 02:00.876
Against the rules.

02:00.936 --> 02:01.737
I didn't, yeah.

02:01.878 --> 02:02.659
I was just teasing.

02:02.679 --> 02:06.968
But I look at that, things I had compared to that, and I say, jeez, I think I had the nice...

02:07.522 --> 02:08.083
Looking great.

02:08.103 --> 02:09.344
What are we looking at?

02:09.484 --> 02:11.486
We're looking at a Picasso.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.387
This is for my tape.

02:12.847 --> 02:18.213
Estimated at $2.8 million to $3.5 million.

02:18.913 --> 02:19.534
And here it is.

02:19.714 --> 02:22.517
There are some great Picassos.

02:22.597 --> 02:23.938
Did you do a thumbnail?

02:23.958 --> 02:25.580
Did you figure out what it grossed?

02:25.640 --> 02:28.143
Less than 10%?

02:28.163 --> 02:29.404
The over $800,000.

02:30.185 --> 02:33.027
Is that about what you expected?

02:33.488 --> 02:34.068
Yeah.

02:34.089 --> 02:34.609
That's about...

02:35.011 --> 02:38.435
It came in overall above the highest number.

02:38.455 --> 02:40.777
Would you like to try to work too?

02:41.318 --> 02:44.841
I think I'm the first one to ask you to do that.

02:44.921 --> 02:45.182
Yeah.

02:45.202 --> 02:46.603
Make sure I've got a pen.

02:47.144 --> 02:47.905
This will work.

02:47.925 --> 02:48.565
What do you want me to say?

02:48.585 --> 02:49.346
Inside someplace.

02:50.547 --> 02:53.811
Just describe it to Nick and put the date on it.

02:53.871 --> 02:57.114
Why don't I ask you to hold on?

02:57.134 --> 02:57.355
Sure.

02:58.496 --> 03:01.559
Well, this is very exciting.

03:01.579 --> 03:02.520
I'll shut this off.

03:03.007 --> 03:26.297
Did your wife come to the sale with you?

03:26.665 --> 03:28.308
She stayed in the hotel.

03:28.328 --> 03:29.790
How did she feel about the collection?

03:29.830 --> 03:32.674
Was she an active participant?

03:32.795 --> 03:33.656
Not really.

03:33.856 --> 03:34.517
Not too much.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.986
I'll let you know when I'm coming out to L.A.

03:40.026 --> 03:40.707
if that's all right.

03:40.747 --> 03:42.570
Maybe we could get together.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.073
Is that all right with you?

03:44.253 --> 03:45.154
I'd love to do it.

03:46.717 --> 03:48.279
I'm shooting back up to Boston now.

03:48.299 --> 03:49.701
I'm a little hyped for you.

03:49.721 --> 03:50.202
Are you?

03:50.222 --> 03:50.403
Oh, yeah.

03:50.923 --> 03:51.204
Really?

03:51.925 --> 03:52.346
Oh, yeah.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.888
So you don't show your abortions.

03:54.155 --> 03:56.659
Oh yeah, I'm, you know, the adrenaline's working.

03:56.679 --> 03:56.879
Really?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.281
Were you nervous at all?

03:58.522 --> 03:58.802
Sure.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.987
What was the nature of your anxiety?

04:02.268 --> 04:04.792
Well, the Jew Bindings.

04:04.812 --> 04:08.377
I mean, the Jew Bindings, whether or not they'd be recognized for what they were.

04:08.417 --> 04:09.158
That's not the money.

04:09.179 --> 04:10.701
You told me that earlier.

04:10.721 --> 04:14.246
No, but I wanted them to be recognized for the importance that they had, and they were.

04:14.607 --> 04:15.268
I mean, there was...

04:15.502 --> 04:16.864
definitely a buyer there.

04:18.046 --> 04:19.368
David wasn't buying for himself.

04:19.548 --> 04:21.231
And at this point you don't know who the buyer is.

04:21.251 --> 04:22.072
No, no.

04:22.092 --> 04:23.053
But you have a good idea.

04:23.354 --> 04:23.835
Might not.

04:24.075 --> 04:24.856
You've got to find out.

04:24.876 --> 04:25.557
Yeah, I'll find out.

04:25.657 --> 04:26.779
I don't have a good idea.

04:26.919 --> 04:28.341
I don't think it is Kenny.

04:28.361 --> 04:29.483
Because he would have gone to Mags.

04:30.344 --> 04:31.306
He always goes to Mags.

04:31.827 --> 04:37.395
And since Mags wasn't bidding against who it was.

04:37.475 --> 04:40.340
But Mags bought heavily early on.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.264
Mags bought a lot of

04:43.767 --> 04:46.271
other kinds of books, but didn't buy the jewel bindings.

04:46.331 --> 04:47.733
The jewel bindings were other people.

04:48.214 --> 04:52.540
But even some of the other jewel bindings came in very, very well.

04:52.921 --> 04:56.666
I thought this was the first jewel binding ever made.

04:56.686 --> 04:58.028
We're looking at 101.

04:58.108 --> 05:00.932
First jewel binding ever done.

05:01.013 --> 05:03.917
And for 14,000, it's a festival of 7,000.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.060
So that was twice the estimate.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.102
And that went very well.

05:07.122 --> 05:08.524
That's the beauty of a book.

05:08.584 --> 05:10.026
We're talking about 100.

05:10.587 --> 05:10.787
Yeah.

05:11.864 --> 05:12.605
That's great.

05:12.625 --> 05:28.527
Well, I'm going to let you go in and take care of your business.

05:35.256 --> 05:37.419
Hello, this is 3708.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.403
When you hear the tone, please leave your name

05:40.636 --> 05:43.139
telephone number, and any message.

05:43.159 --> 05:43.599
Thank you.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.724
Here is the tone.

05:47.744 --> 05:50.087
Mrs. Omora, this is Nick Bazbaines.

05:50.167 --> 05:59.878
I spoke to you about a month ago, and I wrote you a letter and also sent a copy of the letter that I sent to your husband several months ago.

05:59.898 --> 06:06.525
And what I'm inquiring is to the proximity of perhaps talking to him about the formation of his library.

06:07.012 --> 06:09.455
I'll give a call back again next week.

06:09.475 --> 06:14.801
However, my home phone number is 508-839-9257.

06:14.961 --> 06:16.362
Thank you very much.

06:19.025 --> 06:28.957
The date of that call is November 23, 1990 at 2.30 p.m.

06:29.717 --> 06:35.584
I'll have to think about it, you know, what I would not want that to do.

06:36.543 --> 06:42.509
is to present me as an advocate for either side, you know what I'm saying?

06:42.589 --> 06:50.396
I think that would be entirely appropriate for you not to be an advocate, however, from just what brief conversation I had with you.

06:50.416 --> 06:58.084
It's obvious to me that you're one of the two people that I've talked to who has a thorough understanding of this disease in the fabric of society.

07:00.006 --> 07:03.529
Well, and I could give you, if anything, a historical...

07:04.201 --> 07:10.150
Because that's what I'm writing.

07:10.170 --> 07:10.911
I have a historical background on it.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.133
And that's what you were looking for.

07:12.213 --> 07:13.335
That's what we're looking for.

07:13.355 --> 07:21.226
We're looking for things... You've talked to Nicholson and I both, so I guess I'm comfortable talking about him.

07:21.246 --> 07:30.580
You're dealing with two chronic overachievers here, Don Nicholson and myself, that we do not, when we work a case together, do not leave anything...

07:30.863 --> 07:33.086
a chance that we can possibly address.

07:33.567 --> 07:41.498
And just the very fact that there is a history of this particular mental illness is something we fully expect the prosecution to dispute.

07:41.518 --> 07:48.608
Let me also say that I am not suggesting that it's mental illness, by the way.

07:48.628 --> 07:51.392
You're not?

07:51.412 --> 07:54.857
No, I'm not.

07:54.877 --> 07:56.840
I'm going to be honest with you on that.

07:56.980 --> 08:00.145
The people I am writing about

08:00.901 --> 08:10.113
I will happily send you a letter and give you an outline of what I'm doing, but I consider what the people I'm learning about have done very productive things.

08:11.114 --> 08:14.679
I mean, Isaiah Thomas was a bibliomaniac.

08:14.859 --> 08:17.142
It is from him that I get the title of my book.

08:17.563 --> 08:22.169
When he died, his grandson said my grandfather was afflicted with the gentlest of infirmities.

08:22.229 --> 08:24.712
He was a bibliomaniac.

08:24.812 --> 08:26.875
The gentle madness.

08:26.895 --> 08:27.596
Right, exactly.

08:27.616 --> 08:29.338
So from that I derived my title.

08:29.740 --> 08:30.982
But what did he do?

08:31.002 --> 08:33.166
I mean, he went all over.

08:33.186 --> 08:38.976
We're talking about a guy who died in the early 1800s at his time.

08:38.996 --> 08:42.081
He was the most important colonial, federal printer in the United States.

08:42.101 --> 08:48.252
And he happened to be based here in Worcester, but he founded the American Aquarian Society to house his collection.

08:48.672 --> 08:52.018
You know, you have the McCartonian collection.

08:52.437 --> 09:07.615
In England, when they had the dissolution of the monasteries, and they were destroying the Woodastic libraries, and you had a few collectors who definitely were good many maniacs, but you would not have Beowulf, you would not have the Lindisfire and Gospels of the Mespasi and Psalters if it weren't for these people, Sir Thomas Phillips.

09:07.735 --> 09:10.078
Surely you've heard of Sir Thomas Phillips.

09:10.218 --> 09:13.782
That's a book titled, My Mundy Portrait of an Obsession.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.065
Phillips is a guy, he wasn't.

09:16.282 --> 09:22.331
know about, because he was really... Well, I think we're going to probably try to talk you into educating us a little bit.

09:23.653 --> 09:35.552
Phillips was absolutely... I mean, he was a little disturbed, but then again, they were selling his stuff 100 years after he died, and they were making discoveries up until the late 60s.

09:35.712 --> 09:37.034
The guy died in 1872.

09:37.835 --> 09:41.781
Major, major things that exist nowhere else except in his collection, you know?

09:42.422 --> 09:44.145
So, I...

09:45.847 --> 10:03.095
As I said to Don Schoonover when I first talked to him right after this case broke, I thought that when people were saying this guy was a bibliomaniac, I said, I don't think they're really using the right word, because bibliomaniacs, in my mind, can be a very productive thing if it's channeled with restraint.

10:03.936 --> 10:07.382
Not particularly the guy that you're dealing with.

10:08.138 --> 10:12.303
Our guy kind of falls in the middle here.

10:12.323 --> 10:17.990
Well, you know, but there are some things that strengthen, though, what you're saying here in a couple of ways.

10:18.030 --> 10:21.755
Number one, the nature of what he collected was fairly specific.

10:21.775 --> 10:24.017
Number two, he never sold anything for a profit.

10:24.037 --> 10:29.564
There was no intent of furthering his own ends beyond the accumulation of the books.

10:29.624 --> 10:33.589
Number three, one of the things that you said to me the other day has been,

10:34.362 --> 10:44.137
sort of bouncing around my memory ever since, that having to do with the fact that these folks don't make very good preparations for what they're going to do with these books after they're there and they're not around anymore.

10:44.278 --> 10:44.959
That's right.

10:44.979 --> 10:48.304
That's a whole consideration of my book.

10:48.424 --> 10:57.298
And I can give you cases of, I hate to give cases of living people, because one of the things my book has done is

10:58.223 --> 11:00.967
Half of my book is going to be about living book collectors.

11:00.987 --> 11:03.049
You see, that has not been done.

11:03.169 --> 11:07.495
Most people who write about book collectors write about people who've been dead.

11:07.535 --> 11:12.041
Living collectors don't, as a rule, like to talk about their collections for many reasons.

11:12.161 --> 11:13.503
You can appreciate some of them.

11:13.763 --> 11:16.447
Not the least of which is it attracts bandits.

11:16.467 --> 11:16.627
Exactly.

11:16.647 --> 11:23.456
But nevertheless, I have persuaded 25 of the most important collectors of the United States to talk to me.

11:23.576 --> 11:27.201
And in some cases, you've got people who have made very definite provisions

11:27.468 --> 11:29.610
for the disposition of their collection.

11:29.630 --> 11:33.333
You have another guy like Walter Forzheimer, who was a charter member of the CIA.

11:33.353 --> 11:36.296
Well, he's made plans for the stuff to go to Yale.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.979
He's got the finest intelligence collection in the world.

11:39.999 --> 11:44.763
He has a marvelous collection of Bourdieu stuff that he inherited from his father.

11:44.783 --> 11:50.308
But when I visited him at his home and library at the Watergate in Washington, I said, well, now he's in his 70s.

11:50.328 --> 11:53.031
I said, are you going to see this stuff go to Yale?

11:53.111 --> 11:55.753
That's kind of a gentle way of saying, you know,

11:56.155 --> 12:02.803
He said, no, he says, he'll carry me out first, and then he'll carry the books out, you know, and so he's going to keep them.

12:03.104 --> 12:04.505
Stephen visited Yale, too.

12:05.427 --> 12:10.954
Let me just give you a couple of things to pique your interest here.

12:10.974 --> 12:13.337
You don't have to pique my interest.

12:13.357 --> 12:18.683
The Federal Bureau has dramatically underestimated the number of libraries that Stephen visited.

12:18.703 --> 12:19.224
Really?

12:19.424 --> 12:21.146
They say he visited 147.

12:21.327 --> 12:23.069
They say.

12:23.169 --> 12:24.070
They say.

12:24.455 --> 12:28.201
I know that Stephen has, in fact, visited about 281.

12:28.221 --> 12:36.393
They also maintain, of course, that all these books are stolen, which we know is not, in fact, the case.

12:36.413 --> 12:44.305
Many of them were obtained by trade and by incessant haunting of every bookstore within a 2,000-mile radius.

12:44.325 --> 12:48.571
They've also accused him of being out of the country on a number of occasions.

12:48.591 --> 12:53.078
There are some books from Scotland that showed up, but, in fact, Stephen has never left the United States.

12:53.446 --> 12:57.191
This case is just bizarre beyond belief.

12:57.211 --> 13:08.886
And frankly, Nick, today is not my best day to talk about it because I had the entire Bloomberg clan in my house for Thanksgiving yesterday, which is sort of like spending eight hours in the Twilight Zone.

13:08.906 --> 13:12.871
There's such a history of mental illness in this family, it's unbelievable.

13:12.911 --> 13:13.332
History?

13:13.953 --> 13:14.313
Oh, you bet.

13:14.333 --> 13:20.361
We've got four generations of pathological collectors here.

13:20.381 --> 13:20.461
God.

13:20.481 --> 13:21.883
What a hell of a story this is, right here.

13:22.319 --> 13:22.820
I know.

13:24.321 --> 13:24.622
Believe me.

13:24.722 --> 13:27.806
How do I ask this question?

13:27.946 --> 13:34.834
I mean, this is quite a defense that they're putting up for what amount to two interstate transportation charges.

13:36.657 --> 13:45.427
Especially when you're being forced to take a defense of insanity, so obviously you're stipulating to the fact that he took these things.

13:45.447 --> 13:47.370
You bet.

13:47.390 --> 13:47.550
You bet.

13:48.222 --> 13:55.075
Do I gather this is the family kind of circling the wagons around in one of their homes?

13:55.956 --> 14:04.412
Now, what you do in terms of writing this book after the trial is over is what you do then.

14:04.472 --> 14:09.201
What I tell you now, you must give me your word that you will...

14:09.569 --> 14:12.734
handle this in an appropriate manner.

14:12.914 --> 14:16.379
No, I don't do business that way.

14:16.419 --> 14:19.444
If I can't say it, I don't say it.

14:19.464 --> 14:35.629
But you hit on something here, Nick, that is... What you got here, believe it or not, is in fact four generations of various types of mental illness, some of which were far less benign.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.513
And Stephen, for...

14:38.932 --> 14:46.400
A number of reasons became what in the psychiatric trade is called the symptom bearer.

14:46.420 --> 14:47.461
I mean, he's got it all.

14:47.501 --> 14:49.763
We're talking poly madness here.

14:49.843 --> 14:53.447
There's a little bit of everything with this guy.

14:53.807 --> 14:55.369
How do I spell that poly?

14:56.430 --> 14:56.650
P-O-L-Y.

14:56.670 --> 15:08.803
You've got a situation here where you've got a guy who has some of the most bizarre social theories you've ever heard who thinks, for example, that the entire United States economy is going to collapse

15:09.188 --> 15:17.200
and that the only thing that will be worth anything is gold, and therefore accumulates 90 pounds of gold.

15:18.922 --> 15:24.490
The doorknob thing is a whole other thing that's just so far out there it's unreal.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.654
This is public information.

15:26.674 --> 15:29.438
50,000 doorknobs.

15:29.498 --> 15:35.146
900 stained glass windows.

15:35.166 --> 15:38.571
120,078 RPM records.

15:40.576 --> 15:56.719
Can you hang on while I get my other lines?

16:01.386 --> 16:01.606
Absolutely.

16:01.626 --> 16:05.752
I've been haunted by this case literally seven days a week.

16:05.773 --> 16:10.279
Among other things, Nick, I have Steven living with me.

16:10.563 --> 16:12.065
No, no, no.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.168
He's been out on bond since June.

16:14.188 --> 16:15.951
He's living with you?

16:17.894 --> 16:18.114
Well, yeah.

16:18.134 --> 16:19.897
And that's been quite an exciting thing.

16:20.558 --> 16:24.123
However, he has nothing but contempt for my books.

16:24.143 --> 16:33.938
Because I read fiction, and I have a large library, obviously, because of my profession having to do with crime, most of which he finds tedious.

16:34.289 --> 16:39.077
The only thing I own that he respects at all is a first edition Hound of the Baskervilles.

16:39.097 --> 16:40.939
The rest of it, that's junk to him.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.223
Well, that's a pretty, so you collect in some way.

16:43.243 --> 16:45.567
No, just the professional stuff.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.991
Hound of the Baskervilles is a pretty good first edition.

16:48.011 --> 16:50.995
That was a Christmas gift from my wife some years ago.

16:51.196 --> 16:58.768
It really is not, Steve likes it because it's got a fairly decent binding on it, but he can also tell me all these things that I don't have that I should have.

17:00.230 --> 17:00.330
Yeah.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.072
But where were we?

17:02.432 --> 17:03.914
Well, we were talking about the family.

17:03.934 --> 17:05.837
He was talking about four generations.

17:05.997 --> 17:09.101
You got compulsive collector after compulsive collector.

17:09.121 --> 17:10.103
You had one?

17:10.123 --> 17:11.304
Before you, let me interrupt.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.268
Let me say, okay, I'm writing a book.

17:14.669 --> 17:16.532
I work here in a newspaper.

17:16.552 --> 17:18.614
I'm the book editor at the newspaper.

17:18.795 --> 17:24.683
I write periodically on book collecting matters, but that's really to help me organize stuff.

17:24.703 --> 17:30.030
Anything I write about Bloomberg will not appear until after the trial.

17:30.432 --> 17:40.693
And in all likelihood, it will not appear until it appears in my book, unless my agent is able to sell some serials from the book prior to publication.

17:40.713 --> 17:44.661
But in any case, that would be long after that matter is resolved.

17:44.810 --> 17:56.692
In return to that, I will tell you this.

17:56.792 --> 18:01.080
What I feel I can legitimately discuss with you at this point, I will.

18:01.280 --> 18:06.746
with the understanding that I also have an expectation that I may pick your brain in return.

18:07.007 --> 18:09.049
My pleasure.

18:09.129 --> 18:18.179
And I sent you that piece on the, from the, I haven't been home, I was down, Mark was waiting for Thanksgiving, but I have to go find that article that, I mean, took me weeks to find.

18:18.940 --> 18:25.107
It's in the Journal of Criminal Law, and it's titled Bibliomania, and it's an article by Max Sander.

18:25.648 --> 18:29.953
And he does give a number, and it's of criminal law,

18:30.608 --> 18:32.170
cases of bibliomania.

18:32.350 --> 18:38.958
Yeah, the only one of any size in the States in recent years was a fellow by the name of James Richard Shinn.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.160
Shinn was popped in St.

18:40.180 --> 18:47.449
Louis about seven or eight years ago, but he was a straight for-profit steal-on-contract sort of a... How do you spell Shinn?

18:47.609 --> 18:49.391
S-H-I-N-N.

18:49.411 --> 18:49.571
Okay.

18:49.591 --> 18:51.874
You know, Hartman had a couple of cases of bibliomania.

18:52.343 --> 18:58.433
Yeah, I've heard that there have been a number of cases that folks just sort of bite their lower lip and don't talk about it.

18:58.453 --> 19:03.601
Well, they have had a couple, like, and they were members of the faculty and stuff.

19:03.781 --> 19:08.108
The most amazing thing about this one is just the sheer bulk of what he had.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.142
It's more than that.

19:10.302 --> 19:13.726
Well, to me it was, because frankly, he dedicated his whole life to this.

19:13.746 --> 19:17.932
Well, Buck, you see, there's a guy on one island that had over a million books.

19:17.952 --> 19:19.174
Oh, well, he wasn't.

19:19.194 --> 19:21.517
But he didn't send these when I'll start one.

19:21.557 --> 19:23.419
But there was no focus to this guy.

19:23.499 --> 19:28.966
I mean, I'm not interested in a million books, but I just picked up haphazardly at every stop along the way.

19:29.367 --> 19:35.976
What really, I have asked three people who have been in to see the Bloomberg collection, if we can call it that.

19:36.757 --> 19:37.417
I like that.

19:37.758 --> 19:37.858
Yeah.

19:39.408 --> 19:40.530
I'm going to use it, too.

19:40.550 --> 19:40.830
Okay.

19:41.551 --> 19:56.353
And I have asked each one of these people, and you would know the name of every one of these people, well, not taking into account the circumstances of how we acquired it, how do you judge its taste in books?

19:56.772 --> 19:57.513
One exception.

19:57.533 --> 19:59.195
They said the man has excellent taste.

20:00.056 --> 20:01.017
It's a beautiful collection.

20:01.297 --> 20:01.717
You know what I mean?

20:01.738 --> 20:04.260
She shows a lot of discrimination, a lot of taste.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.281
That's what you're going to have.

20:05.301 --> 20:10.547
By the way, if you want to talk frankly, that's maybe where you're going to have trouble on the inside of the end.

20:10.567 --> 20:24.243
Well, we're aware of that, but you see, it's a much larger issue in the sense that there are focuses to that collection, but the focuses feed right back into 25, well, almost 35 years of mental illness.

20:24.263 --> 20:24.703
They are

20:25.207 --> 20:38.526
items that revolve around, uh, a wider, um, keeping in mind I'm not a psychiatrist, uh, they revolve around a wider illness than just this.

20:38.546 --> 20:47.919
What this is with Steve in many ways is an attempt to retreat totally into the past, specifically into the late Victorian era.

20:47.939 --> 20:53.647
Uh, his interests primarily revolved around that and religion.

20:53.667 --> 20:53.847
Um,

20:54.130 --> 21:00.756
there is a tremendous amount of religious material in the books.

21:00.776 --> 21:02.657
Is there a particular religion or just a religion?

21:03.058 --> 21:04.099
Generic, really.

21:05.020 --> 21:18.231
The two focuses that I noticed is a lot of interest in Catholicism, especially early Catholicism, hence the Bishop's Bible, et cetera, et cetera, and also around the Mormons.

21:18.331 --> 21:22.635
Now, some of his odd social theories, if I can call them that,

21:22.970 --> 21:29.020
also have to do with the Mormons, and he's into conspiracies heavily.

21:29.040 --> 21:46.788
I mean, we're talking about things like the Bavarian Illuminati, this long-running thing about the relationship between the Mormons and the Masons, and some pretty, well, you know, I don't quite have a word for it that doesn't sound derogatory.

21:46.808 --> 21:49.011
No, I'm pretty interested in this stuff.

21:49.261 --> 21:55.536
I mean, there are people who collected, you know, extraordinary collections on witchcraft.

21:55.656 --> 21:59.005
And, you know, it's just one thing.

21:59.025 --> 22:04.779
Have you even seen a bibliography or a listing of these books?

22:04.859 --> 22:05.380
Some of them.

22:05.832 --> 22:11.318
The thing, the listings alone run to a couple thousand pages.

22:11.478 --> 22:15.803
I saw one that was put together on an Americana thing.

22:15.823 --> 22:16.824
It was full out.

22:16.844 --> 22:28.176
I didn't get it from him, so I could tell you, from Glenn Dawson out of L.A., which I got from somebody else, who's an expert on that particular end.

22:28.236 --> 22:30.139
I was very impressed by him.

22:30.159 --> 22:33.342
Oh, it's an impressive collection.

22:33.575 --> 22:39.761
However, gone into, you know, first of all, this is something that you need to be aware of.

22:40.101 --> 22:45.166
There have, in fact, been no book fests for over three years.

22:45.206 --> 22:57.137
The book thing, I think, had finally caught up with him to the point where he simply could not control the collection, or had been trying, at least, to control the collecting.

22:57.437 --> 23:00.540
Oh, control the collecting, control himself.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.502
Essentially the same thing.

23:02.988 --> 23:08.055
By the way, you've got to meet this guy at some point.

23:08.075 --> 23:11.179
I'd be very disappointed if I went out there and it didn't happen.

23:11.259 --> 23:15.044
He is one of the most self-effacing individuals I have ever met.

23:16.806 --> 23:18.228
I've seen his IQ tests.

23:18.248 --> 23:21.412
I've seen his abilities, both artistic and in other ways.

23:21.652 --> 23:24.516
He's a fine graphic artist.

23:26.558 --> 23:30.143
But to see him or to talk to him, you would think you were dealing with a homeless person here.

23:30.832 --> 23:35.259
his personal hygiene borders on a tooth ball.

23:35.279 --> 23:36.481
Believe me, I know.

23:36.501 --> 23:39.446
How is it that people don't remember seeing him in their libraries?

23:39.466 --> 23:42.491
He remembers somebody who didn't smell good.

23:42.591 --> 23:45.336
Are you, by any chance, a Woody Allen fan?

23:45.937 --> 23:46.137
Yeah.

23:46.157 --> 23:46.938
Okay.

23:47.098 --> 23:50.023
Did you ever see Allen's movie, Zelec?

23:50.043 --> 23:50.143
No.

23:50.163 --> 23:53.889
Well, this is a movie that Woody made about ten years ago.

23:53.990 --> 23:56.714
It's about this guy who's the ultimate chameleon.

23:56.734 --> 23:57.936
He becomes a Nazi.

23:58.591 --> 24:03.852
And later on, he becomes a member of the Civil Rights Movement with Reverend King.

24:04.434 --> 24:04.976
Steve can do that.

24:05.619 --> 24:06.964
Functional invisibility.

24:09.121 --> 24:10.983
Is he going to take the stand, by the way?

24:11.263 --> 24:11.924
Oh, no.

24:12.765 --> 24:13.626
Oh, no way.

24:13.646 --> 24:14.487
Oh, no.

24:14.627 --> 24:15.308
Why not?

24:15.328 --> 24:24.599
Well, because this is an insanity defense, and if we put him on the stand and the prosecution can find some area of lucidity of which there are some, they can damage our defense.

24:24.619 --> 24:30.326
It would be unwise for either his attorney or myself to have even suggested he'd be on the stand.

24:30.346 --> 24:38.335
You know, just let me say that I do know that people go in there testifying and tell you that you know this.

24:38.618 --> 24:42.283
how extraordinary the collection is, how focused it is.

24:42.944 --> 24:44.567
We're not quarreling with it.

24:44.587 --> 24:45.588
How selective it is.

24:45.708 --> 24:46.950
Yeah, we're not quarreling with that at all.

24:46.970 --> 24:48.052
We're not talking about what.

24:48.072 --> 24:50.355
We're talking about why.

24:50.375 --> 25:00.309
Now, one of the things you always ask a collector, a genuine collector, as opposed to an accumulator, there are two kinds of people who gather books right away acquiring.

25:00.329 --> 25:02.452
They are either accumulators or collectors.

25:02.913 --> 25:05.497
The true collector knows his collection.

25:05.517 --> 25:06.859
Does Stephen know his collection?

25:07.299 --> 25:07.680
Intellectually.

25:09.820 --> 25:10.461
intimately.

25:10.481 --> 25:13.165
Those books that he could read, he did.

25:13.185 --> 25:17.712
But he never acquired an item and just put it on the shelf.

25:17.732 --> 25:20.716
Do you think he made an attempt to penetrate it, to understand it?

25:20.736 --> 25:29.129
That he also did because of the limitations on his ability to read other languages and specifically Latin.

25:29.149 --> 25:34.176
He would attempt to piece his way through these things.

25:34.196 --> 25:36.199
This guy's looking for the answer.

25:36.972 --> 25:40.257
All of this has to do with looking for the answer.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.981
That's the capital A. All right, but what's the question?

25:43.001 --> 25:44.143
Well, you know, I don't know.

25:44.163 --> 25:45.245
What's the capital Q?

25:46.546 --> 25:51.414
I could be facetious and say the question is, what is the meaning of life?

25:51.434 --> 25:52.756
Well, no, that's what I mean.

25:52.916 --> 25:54.759
That may in fact be what he was looking for.

25:54.779 --> 26:00.227
Listen, you're talking to a guy who deals with book collectors, I mean, and who happens to be one himself, you know.

26:00.327 --> 26:04.093
Well, you're talking to a guy who primarily deals with murderers, and I've been

26:04.310 --> 26:08.037
Yes, if I did some biggies, including the Gacy case over in Chicago.

26:08.057 --> 26:08.558
Which one?

26:08.839 --> 26:09.641
Oh, really?

26:09.781 --> 26:09.981
Yeah.

26:10.001 --> 26:10.803
It was a big case.

26:10.823 --> 26:11.584
You betcha.

26:11.685 --> 26:13.689
Weirdest damn thing I ever saw with John Gacy.

26:13.709 --> 26:16.674
He's nowhere near as far out as Steve Blumberg is.

26:16.695 --> 26:18.057
Do you have an affection to this guy?

26:18.378 --> 26:21.203
You cannot help it.

26:21.244 --> 26:26.554
There is something about this man that does... I'm not a particularly kind-hearted person.

26:27.175 --> 26:33.766
But I do have an affection for him because it is a gentle madness, and frankly... You like my title, huh?

26:33.866 --> 26:34.947
Yes, very much.

26:35.108 --> 26:36.750
I admire that greatly.

26:36.770 --> 26:37.732
You're not going to talk it around now.

26:37.752 --> 26:42.740
No, but I'll tell you, it's perfect for this case.

26:42.760 --> 26:46.586
I mean, you told me the other day about someone who had killed for a book.

26:46.606 --> 26:47.007
This is a guy, yeah.

26:47.027 --> 26:50.352
This is a guy who might very well die for a book.

26:50.492 --> 26:54.178
He told me, he said, you know, I knew someday I was going to be in one of these places.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.810
go after me and I might get hurt or even killed.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.153
But I couldn't stop.

27:01.173 --> 27:02.074
I had to save these things.

27:02.094 --> 27:05.998
Did he have an idea when he was going in what he was going after?

27:06.479 --> 27:09.622
Or was it more like targets of opportunity as we used to say in the Navy?

27:09.642 --> 27:12.785
You know, again, it's somewhere in the middle.

27:12.846 --> 27:16.149
Sometimes I think yes and other times definitely no.

27:16.169 --> 27:20.554
He also went into a number of libraries that I know of that he didn't take anything from.

27:21.192 --> 27:36.316
One of the more humorous aspects of this business, of his being out on bond, is when he was moved down here to Des Moines from Minneapolis, they put a restriction on his bond that he couldn't go into libraries or museums.

27:36.516 --> 27:41.564
And this is a man who practically lives his life in places like that.

27:41.584 --> 27:45.630
And I had to deliver that news to him, and he got this kind of...

27:45.796 --> 27:48.338
I'd look at his eyes, and he said, Ray, it doesn't matter.

27:48.378 --> 27:53.423
I've been in all the libraries around here, and there's nothing that I'm worth taking.

27:53.443 --> 27:57.987
Well, I'll give you a, I mentioned Sir Robert Cotton to you earlier, right?

27:58.007 --> 28:04.773
Sir Robert Cotton, he's the fellow who rescued Beowulf, and a number of other wonderful, wonderful things.

28:04.793 --> 28:10.177
Basically, the British Museum was started as a result of his collection.

28:10.197 --> 28:13.560
But he also was a very political guy, and he got in trouble with the crown.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.702
In fact, there was even a, well, this is all documents.

28:16.627 --> 28:25.860
He had trouble with the crown, and he was supposed to have his head chopped off, but they let him go.

28:26.241 --> 28:28.023
But there was one provision.

28:28.043 --> 28:35.314
They sealed his library, and he could never visit his books for the rest of his life, and he died of a broken heart.

28:35.334 --> 28:38.158
They did the same kind of thing that they did to your guy.

28:38.178 --> 28:40.080
I think he's dying of a broken heart.

28:40.101 --> 28:40.481
He is.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.163
He loved these things, huh?

28:42.183 --> 28:45.368
I think I told you the other day about what it was like

28:45.635 --> 28:52.567
going over there to that warehouse in Omaha with him.

28:54.450 --> 28:58.236
I have never in my life seen him in pain that concentrated.

28:58.256 --> 29:00.740
Just the sheer agony came off of him way to the day.

29:00.760 --> 29:07.472
And frankly, after that, I think Steve began to stop caring about what happened to him.

29:07.492 --> 29:11.338
All along during this entire thing, his biggest worry was

29:11.723 --> 29:18.253
tell that day had been whether or not the Phoebes were taking care of these books.

29:18.273 --> 29:20.076
What are you telling them?

29:20.297 --> 29:21.198
The Federal Bureau of Investigation.

29:21.218 --> 29:22.781
They have a lot of names in my business.

29:22.801 --> 29:28.209
We call them the Phoebes, and we also occasionally have been known to say that FBI stands for Fart, Belch, and Lie.

29:30.413 --> 29:34.519
But you're on a different level than us.

29:34.539 --> 29:36.162
You don't have to be the target of these guys,

29:36.395 --> 29:42.961
Well, you know, they'll go after a defense investigator, too.

29:43.021 --> 29:46.504
I've had them chase me around and flip me a bunch at that time on other cases.

29:46.605 --> 29:53.431
Although, basically, they've been pretty, well, they've left us pretty much alone on this one.

29:53.451 --> 29:56.894
But in any case, yeah, I can see that where someone would.

29:56.954 --> 30:06.283
I think after Steve saw that the books were, that the collection was intact, that they were not suffering from any sort of environmental damage or anything like that,

30:06.550 --> 30:10.076
but that he could not touch them and probably would never touch them again.

30:10.096 --> 30:14.784
I think he's sort of given up heat, which is very sad.

30:14.804 --> 30:22.897
Now, you asked earlier why we were fighting this thing as hard and aggressively as we are.

30:22.937 --> 30:25.822
The answer to that is very simple.

30:25.842 --> 30:32.052
The United States Prosecutor's Office has indicated that they want to go not only for the charges proper,

30:32.437 --> 30:39.984
to argue under the sentencing guidelines for an upward enhancement to give this guy 10 flat calendar years in prison.

30:40.004 --> 30:57.421
Given the nature of that sort of approach, it would be remiss for Nicholson or anyone else on the defense team to even contemplate fleeing him or anything like that because they're just simply, you know, they're proceeding from the assumption that they have some sort of master thief here.

30:57.521 --> 31:01.144
And you have a highly intelligent thief

31:01.546 --> 31:07.819
but he's not a master thief, and he does not necessarily even perceive himself as a thief.

31:07.839 --> 31:08.500
He doesn't?

31:08.720 --> 31:10.283
He doesn't believe he stole anything?

31:10.304 --> 31:17.057
Well, you know, this is one of those odd sort of mindsets that comes when you deal with the really far-out criminal stuff.

31:17.408 --> 31:21.674
I commend your attention to a case called United States v. Sullivan.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.957
It was decided a couple of years ago.

31:24.298 --> 31:26.081
That's not Sullivan v. New York Times.

31:26.361 --> 31:28.584
Let me explain it down to U.S.

31:28.845 --> 31:29.966
I'm going to Harvard next week.

31:29.986 --> 31:30.567
Yeah, U.S.D.

31:30.587 --> 31:30.988
Sullivan.

31:31.008 --> 31:34.092
Basically what it said was this was an insanity defense case.

31:34.593 --> 31:44.327
And basically what it said was even in a situation where someone knows that what they are doing is wrong, if they are totally convinced that they have a moral obligation to carry out that act,

31:44.915 --> 31:47.761
Then, in fact, the insanity defense does apply.

31:47.881 --> 31:52.631
It's also been referred to, by the way, as the Henry David Thoreau.

31:52.651 --> 31:53.272
Beautiful.

31:53.372 --> 31:54.374
Stephen did not steal.

31:54.695 --> 31:55.997
He rescued.

31:56.017 --> 31:57.019
In Stephen's mind.

31:57.120 --> 31:57.961
In Stephen's mind.

31:58.062 --> 32:00.326
Except that he had burglary tools, so.

32:00.346 --> 32:00.747
Oh, yeah.

32:02.144 --> 32:04.708
On the other hand, I know that he got into the library.

32:05.108 --> 32:06.811
No, go right ahead.

32:06.831 --> 32:07.191
Go right ahead.

32:07.592 --> 32:12.559
On the other hand, he got into the secure section at the library at Dartmouth with a piece of dental floss.

32:12.579 --> 32:14.663
Because that's probably all he realized that he needed.

32:14.723 --> 32:16.385
Yeah.

32:16.405 --> 32:21.112
All I'm saying is that, let's say I'm a juror.

32:21.132 --> 32:29.164
I've not met any of these people, and I don't like to go any way, but I see if the guys, if the feds come in with a whole bag of burglary tools...

32:29.735 --> 32:36.807
purposes only to break and to enter, then you have to say to yourself, he didn't know he was stealing, question mark?

32:37.087 --> 32:38.469
Oh, no, that's not what we're saying at all.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.373
But he's using these tools to rescue.

32:40.593 --> 32:43.077
Again, it's not about what, it's about why.

32:46.282 --> 32:46.403
Right.

32:46.423 --> 32:55.157
You know, on a number of occasions also, you know, he spent money out of his own pocket having various items from his collection restored.

32:55.498 --> 32:56.099
Are you kidding?

32:56.119 --> 32:56.299
No.

32:57.595 --> 33:09.710
He had entirely sealed that house in a tumbler to create an environmentally correct placement for the books so that they would not deteriorate in any way.

33:10.291 --> 33:16.519
He protected these books aggressively.

33:16.539 --> 33:19.823
The lengths that he went to...

33:22.537 --> 33:31.071
protect the books, to love them, if you will, is far beyond anything that a professional criminal would do.

33:31.091 --> 33:49.101
What you have here, sadly enough, is an individual who, because of aspects of his own life, has grown up functionally unable to love people, but who can love things and has replaced people with things.

33:49.351 --> 33:55.739
I have one of the quotes that opens my book, the very first page, is this French guy who I've told you, Sylvester de Sassi.

33:56.680 --> 34:03.728
And he just says, oh, my darling books, who will love you the way I have loved you when I'm gone?

34:04.509 --> 34:07.032
Who has gathered you with the sweat of his brow?

34:07.052 --> 34:10.977
You know, he just can't stand the thought of seeing them laid out in the ocean.

34:10.997 --> 34:17.244
I mean, he's talking about them as a piece of tale.

34:17.264 --> 34:17.464
Excuse me.

34:17.484 --> 34:18.025
Exactly.

34:18.308 --> 34:30.286
I mean, more than that, as a lifelong companion, the mother of his children, whatever, you know, they actually go from being inanimate to animate objects.

34:30.406 --> 34:32.008
And it's a phenomenon.

34:32.028 --> 34:38.838
It's almost impossible to put your finger on it, except that we know it, we see it, and I've traced it through the centuries.

34:38.999 --> 34:46.890
And it is now in the DSM-3 and DSM-3R, so there's no question about it being a valid psychiatric issue.

34:46.910 --> 34:47.071
What?

34:47.091 --> 34:48.012
I'm sorry, what is that?

34:48.464 --> 34:54.114
Guidebooks that are used by psychiatrists for... This is something I want to check out.

34:54.154 --> 34:55.817
...specifically for diagnosing.

34:56.679 --> 35:05.715
They're usually referred to, and I should know what they mean, but it's called the DSM-3 and the DSM-3R, which that's the newest version.

35:05.736 --> 35:06.557
And these are what?

35:07.077 --> 35:08.699
You mean Bibliomania is in there?

35:08.839 --> 35:16.247
Yeah, this is the listing of all the various manias and, you know, diagnoses that have been... You're kidding me.

35:16.307 --> 35:16.928
No, it's in there.

35:17.368 --> 35:20.191
This is something I'm going to tackle Monday, I'm afraid.

35:20.211 --> 35:24.095
I got that information from our fellow down at Manager.

35:24.115 --> 35:26.738
We've even got to Manager Clinic in this story.

35:27.179 --> 35:28.380
Yeah.

35:28.440 --> 35:35.127
That's the one nice thing about this one, as opposed to most of the cases I do where I'm defending a team with...

35:35.393 --> 35:42.182
a client who's either impoverished or close to it, is that we can fight this one, full-tilt Boogie.

35:42.202 --> 35:45.166
Are we saying that he's almost impoverished?

35:45.186 --> 35:46.368
No, no, he's not at all.

35:46.428 --> 35:48.430
Quite the contrary.

35:48.451 --> 35:49.812
Most of my clients are.

35:50.353 --> 35:51.955
But there is support from the family.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.537
There is.

35:53.557 --> 35:56.161
Pregnant of support from the family.

35:56.802 --> 35:59.465
But, you know, even that's a double-edged sword.

36:00.166 --> 36:04.472
If he hadn't acquired any books, notice I'm using the word acquire,

36:04.908 --> 36:07.511
as opposed to another more pejorative word.

36:08.913 --> 36:14.120
In three years, what, did somebody drop a dime on him or something?

36:14.561 --> 36:15.362
He was overloaded.

36:15.562 --> 36:17.685
He didn't have any place to put him.

36:17.865 --> 36:25.515
And I think that from what I've been able to discover, not from what he's told me, but that he had a sense that they were aware of him.

36:26.052 --> 36:27.354
by name.

36:27.374 --> 36:30.959
And in fact, my feeling is that they've been aware of him by name since 1985.

36:32.221 --> 36:35.225
From what I understand, he was actually stopped once.

36:35.245 --> 36:37.128
He was detained.

36:37.168 --> 36:39.131
Actually twice.

36:39.291 --> 36:46.762
Once in 1974 in Colorado with a carload of books and once in 1988 out in Riverside, California.

36:46.822 --> 36:47.403
Where?

36:47.423 --> 36:48.485
Riverside.

36:48.865 --> 36:52.651
But the first instance is 16 years.

36:52.671 --> 36:52.971
Yeah.

36:54.571 --> 36:57.434
Well, I tell you, this is a fascinating story.

36:57.454 --> 36:58.095
It's awesome.

36:58.115 --> 36:58.315
All right.

36:58.435 --> 37:12.229
But, you know, if you, I have probably right now, the investigative files and documents on this case, I would say right now probably are close to three feet thick.

37:12.249 --> 37:12.349
Jeez.

37:12.589 --> 37:21.118
You know, when I was hired on this thing, I was given to understand that I was not going to be able to work on anything else except this until we went to trial.

37:21.158 --> 37:24.021
Our original trial date was in September.

37:24.153 --> 37:41.854
And very honestly, I would have had to do it this way in any case, because the thing is, we're basically finding ourselves with a lifetime of pathology, all of which has to be dismantled and understood.

37:41.914 --> 37:47.601
This collecting mania with him actually started back when he was 14.

37:47.621 --> 37:49.984
It goes back that far.

37:50.004 --> 37:51.425
This is going to come out of the trial?

37:51.445 --> 37:52.066
Oh, yeah.

37:52.086 --> 37:53.788
This will all come out of the trial.

37:55.996 --> 37:57.738
Wow.

37:57.758 --> 37:59.801
All right.

37:59.821 --> 38:00.902
Where do we go from here?

38:00.942 --> 38:02.244
That's my question.

38:02.745 --> 38:06.009
Let me write you a letter.

38:06.029 --> 38:06.309
All right.

38:06.389 --> 38:07.831
I have to think.

38:08.031 --> 38:13.638
I don't want to do anything that would damage myself as an impartial observer.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.363
No, and I would appreciate that caution.

38:17.647 --> 38:20.911
I have to be, you know, hey, I'm done.

38:20.932 --> 38:27.440
Now, I'll tell you, I'm going to ask for your help on the trial, but there's another issue, and I want to be up front with you.

38:27.460 --> 38:30.344
But I don't want to blow it and be identified as a partisan in any camp.

38:30.404 --> 38:30.705
Right.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.147
I can't do that.

38:32.167 --> 38:39.096
The other aspect of this is that the family has approached me and asked me if I will write a book about him when this is over.

38:39.337 --> 38:41.019
Well, now you and I have to talk.

38:41.039 --> 38:43.002
So that's why I'm bringing this up.

38:43.022 --> 38:43.182
Okay.

38:43.465 --> 38:45.627
I would not be writing about bibliomania.

38:45.767 --> 38:47.949
I would be writing about Steve Blumberg.

38:47.969 --> 38:50.711
Let me just briefly give you my situation, okay?

38:50.731 --> 38:51.052
Okay.

38:51.072 --> 38:52.053
My situation is this.

38:52.193 --> 38:55.576
I am under contract to Random House.

38:55.836 --> 39:02.041
I will be completing this book by June of 91.

39:02.061 --> 39:11.970
I'm on the contract to submit it in March of 91, but I get an extension through June because I've traveled close to 40,000 miles in the last year, and the...

39:12.187 --> 39:15.432
The research has just gone beyond my wildest expectations.

39:15.572 --> 39:16.033
Oh, yeah.

39:16.053 --> 39:17.936
And it's going to be a really fine book.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.358
I also have a paperback deal.

39:19.418 --> 39:22.402
This is my first book, but I have what's known as a hard, soft deal.

39:22.563 --> 39:27.390
I got a hardcover deal with Random House and a softcover deal with Lentridge.

39:27.931 --> 39:30.294
And I have confidence in the book.

39:30.314 --> 39:34.701
I'm also writing a piece from the New York Times, which will appear in February, which will not be blown in this case.

39:35.170 --> 39:35.791
Anyway.

39:35.871 --> 39:37.212
Good, because we'll be in trial then.

39:37.232 --> 39:37.653
Yeah, I don't know.

39:37.673 --> 39:44.581
This is going to be the status of book collecting right now with the economic recession, blah, blah, blah.

39:44.681 --> 39:47.525
How does it compare with book collecting 50 years ago?

39:47.545 --> 39:54.313
Well, it will give me a little more credibility as a writer with a national punch.

39:54.413 --> 39:56.916
In fact, I was able to score this with the Times.

39:57.116 --> 39:58.558
It was spectacular.

39:58.798 --> 40:00.520
But my contract also closed.

40:00.540 --> 40:02.743
I mean, they have an option.

40:02.763 --> 40:04.705
You can't do better than Random House, by the way.

40:05.242 --> 40:08.646
for our book, you know?

40:08.666 --> 40:10.148
I'm looking for another book.

40:10.388 --> 40:12.911
And I'll have this one done in June.

40:12.931 --> 40:18.398
It will appear, and God willing, in March of 92.

40:18.418 --> 40:22.703
And by that time, I really hope to be working on book number two.

40:22.723 --> 40:27.229
I hope it would be nice if I could be working on it now.

40:27.309 --> 40:28.450
Well, you're a published writer.

40:28.470 --> 40:29.091
I'm not.

40:29.171 --> 40:34.017
Let me also tell you that one of the reasons I got a delay was talking to my editor in New York

40:35.397 --> 40:49.651
And I said, let me go in June on this book, because I do want to go up to Des Moines.

40:49.671 --> 40:51.713
And she said, wow, you know, she liked it.

40:51.733 --> 40:54.356
She's a senior editor at Random House.

40:54.456 --> 40:56.458
So she thought that was wonderful.

40:56.478 --> 41:00.962
So what I'm saying is, you should certainly sit down and have a cup of coffee or a drink or something.

41:00.982 --> 41:02.424
I want to go up to Des Moines and just talk informally.

41:02.444 --> 41:03.885
I think that would be a good idea.

41:04.186 --> 41:09.174
For one thing, I can give you access to some things that will not be trial material.

41:09.815 --> 41:15.504
I have all the appropriate releases already in place, but I can give you access.

41:15.784 --> 41:31.009
And I must tell you, I'm not all that enthusiastic about writing a book about this, because very frankly, I run a fairly successful private investigative practice, and by the time this comes down, I'll have already spent eight months on one case.

41:31.029 --> 41:31.830
That's how it works.

41:32.165 --> 41:39.613
You know, my people are already up my butt about the fact that they're out there doing other cases and I'm not available to back them up.

41:39.953 --> 41:42.837
So maybe we should talk and maybe there's something that can be worked out.

41:42.857 --> 41:59.775
What I would like to say, though, is that I think this is an important story not only in terms of the specific events and the specific crimes, but also in terms of how somebody like this can be created in a society like ours.

42:00.481 --> 42:05.146
You know, I mean, where does this man come from?

42:05.166 --> 42:15.698
And if you can speak to that with a vehicle through Random House, more power to you.

42:15.758 --> 42:19.983
I've got no problem with that.

42:20.564 --> 42:25.890
I have goosebumps right here because you're talking.

42:25.910 --> 42:26.230
This is my work.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.352
You know, I think this is something I would love to do.

42:27.372 --> 42:29.374
And I think the fact that this book that I'm doing would give me the perfect credibility

42:30.063 --> 42:35.068
Well, it would be, I think, an ideal springboard into writing a specific one.

42:35.089 --> 42:42.176
Yeah, and I've got another guy up here that, well, don't talk about it.

42:42.196 --> 42:44.479
I'm a boy with this now, but this is a fascinating story.

42:44.499 --> 42:51.987
Now, one thing I'll make you aware of, there is a possibility here that this thing will not go to trial, and let me tell you why.

42:52.728 --> 42:56.492
The day before yesterday, we filed a motion to suppress the search warrant.

42:56.911 --> 43:02.920
As in most criminal cases involving property, everything springs from the search warrant.

43:02.940 --> 43:10.232
This search warrant was obtained in the most surreptitious manner I have ever seen the FBI use.

43:10.252 --> 43:16.121
There's a long-term paid confidential informant in this story and a whole bunch of other stuff.

43:16.141 --> 43:23.593
Now, we don't have a date set for our suppression hearing, obviously, since it was filed on Wednesday afternoon, but...

43:23.945 --> 43:30.055
If that warrant is suppressed, there's a possibility this matter will never go to trial.

43:30.075 --> 43:31.237
Did you want that?

43:31.257 --> 43:36.686
For myself, I think it would probably in some ways be a relief.

43:36.906 --> 43:45.740
But professionally, it will leave a whole other gamut of issues involving what happens next.

43:45.760 --> 43:48.344
You know, I mean, they got nine tons of Steve shit.

43:48.384 --> 43:49.446
What are they going to do with it?

43:50.607 --> 43:51.609
You think I'm kidding.

43:52.211 --> 43:52.371
I'm not.

43:52.391 --> 43:53.775
Let's say they suppressed a lot.

43:53.795 --> 43:58.486
That means they'd have to return the stuff to Steve, even though it's already... Everything they cannot prove was stolen.

43:58.506 --> 44:04.701
I mean, I understand there are 750 books alone from Harvard that have been identified, 550 from the library of Harvard.

44:04.721 --> 44:08.650
But they were all obtained from, as the product of that search warrant.

44:09.187 --> 44:14.794
Yeah, but then these institutions would probably have to go through the civil courts to recover.

44:14.874 --> 44:15.254
Oh, yeah.

44:15.274 --> 44:24.345
What you'd see is probably at least five years of forfeiture hearings, which in the long run would be a much more difficult task for the feds than to take into trial.

44:24.365 --> 44:31.354
But there's been a lot of play dirty in this one beyond anything I've ever seen.

44:31.374 --> 44:33.036
Let me give you one last anecdote.

44:33.076 --> 44:35.278
My wife just came home, so I got to split here a second.

44:35.359 --> 44:38.282
But when we wanted to go see those books...

44:39.207 --> 44:42.291
over there in Omaha in October.

44:43.812 --> 44:46.275
First they had no problem with it.

44:46.295 --> 44:51.001
And then they said, well, we're going to do that, but we're going to blindfold your client.

44:51.021 --> 44:51.421
Jesus.

44:51.441 --> 44:52.623
And I'm going, wait a minute.

44:52.643 --> 44:54.325
What is this, James Bond?

44:55.506 --> 44:58.229
And we went back and forth with him about that for a few days.

44:58.269 --> 45:01.072
And then he said, oh, we won't blindfold him.

45:01.092 --> 45:02.354
Fine, glad we got that out of the way.

45:02.374 --> 45:07.560
And, of course, their stated reason is that although they say that Steve is not in any way deranged,

45:07.945 --> 45:17.995
Their stated reason was that they were afraid this guy was going to back a semi up to an FBI-bonded warehouse and haul all these books out, right, all 28,000 of them.

45:18.015 --> 45:19.517
But we ended up going over there.

45:19.597 --> 45:33.571
They put us in the back of an FBI vehicle, but they had taped a masking tape on the inside of the windows and blacked out the front of the vehicle by hanging an army blanket between the front and back seats, and they drove us up and down the Omaha freeways for 45 minutes.

45:33.672 --> 45:34.172
Yes, sir.

45:34.827 --> 45:38.390
I asked to go in there, you know, and I said, you can blindfold me.

45:38.410 --> 45:40.092
I said, I've never been to Omaha.

45:40.392 --> 45:48.600
I actually drove through 25 years ago when I was going out to the coast to join my ship, you know, in the Navy, but 20 years ago, whatever it was.

45:48.620 --> 45:52.904
But I just wanted to go in and get the ambiance, because there's got to be an ambiance, there's got to be a feeling in there.

45:52.924 --> 45:57.989
It's going to be an atmospheric thing that you can tap into, you know, I mean, in terms of writing.

45:58.009 --> 46:00.852
And it was, this was no how, no way, you know.

46:01.253 --> 46:04.076
And that's fine.

46:04.096 --> 46:04.657
I got no problems with that.

46:04.677 --> 46:07.601
Well, having been in there, I can tell you this much.

46:07.721 --> 46:22.139
What you're seeing there is something that is so incongruous, because here you have all these old, rare books going back centuries, and they're on stainless steel shelving.

46:22.419 --> 46:22.519
Yeah.

46:22.837 --> 46:24.579
with fluorescent lights over them.

46:24.599 --> 46:25.219
Well, that's bad.

46:25.439 --> 46:27.401
They shouldn't have lights.

46:27.421 --> 46:32.586
Well, that lighting business apparently has been corrected now because they're done actually cataloging.

46:32.606 --> 46:35.168
I think those books are just sitting there in the dark now.

46:35.188 --> 46:39.412
At least I hope they are, because Steve brought that issue up, too, about the lights.

46:39.432 --> 46:40.233
These are his children.

46:40.874 --> 46:41.254
I'm sorry?

46:41.274 --> 46:41.694
He's right?

46:41.835 --> 46:43.736
These books are his children, and he loves them all.

46:44.397 --> 46:49.982
See, I've got another guy here, and when they made him sell his books, and that's the story I'll tell you about.

46:50.222 --> 46:50.903
The story is...

46:51.119 --> 46:56.105
You're forcing me to sell my children and to slave me.

46:56.125 --> 46:58.127
Do you see the parallels here?

46:58.267 --> 47:00.469
Oh, the parallels are tremendous.

47:01.070 --> 47:10.321
Mr. Nicholson and I had lunch on Wednesday before he left to visit his family in Delaware, and we both agreed that it was a fortuitous happenstance that you called.

47:10.341 --> 47:11.061
Really?

47:12.143 --> 47:20.552
Both of us are interested in your project because we're both curious about this thing, but we're also interested in what we perceive as the kind of...

47:21.089 --> 47:25.236
background and supporting information you can give us about this.

47:25.256 --> 47:27.720
Well, let me just go over and make sure I've got the right address here.

47:27.740 --> 47:28.461
Okay, Ray.

47:29.062 --> 47:30.044
Is it Ray?

47:30.064 --> 47:31.025
Is it Raymond or just Ray?

47:31.106 --> 47:32.207
Right, it's Raymond.

47:32.287 --> 47:34.912
Okay, Ray Cornell, and I have trouble there.

47:34.972 --> 47:40.261
I think I have 1507-C-H-A-U-Q-U-A.

47:40.481 --> 47:40.681
Right.

47:40.701 --> 47:41.803
And what is it?

47:41.823 --> 47:42.084
Parkway.

47:42.104 --> 47:42.504
Parkway.

47:42.625 --> 47:42.945
Parkway.

47:43.465 --> 47:57.083
Oh, I would sure appreciate that.

47:57.163 --> 48:06.356
If it would help, just for your own interest, in return, I can, and I've already got permission from Don to do this, I can send you one thing you might find interesting.

48:06.436 --> 48:08.459
A few photographs of the books.

48:08.879 --> 48:09.540
I love it.

48:09.773 --> 48:10.814
All right, I'll take care of it.

48:10.834 --> 48:11.736
Do you have my address?

48:12.396 --> 48:13.438
No, I don't.

48:13.778 --> 48:14.439
So I'd better get it.

48:14.459 --> 48:17.343
Let me get my... All right, go ahead.

48:17.423 --> 48:30.099
I'll give you my PO address and also my home address, but my post office box number is 120 North Grafton, G-R-A-F-T-O-N, M-A, Mass.

48:30.199 --> 48:37.168
And my home address is 92 East Street, which is North Grafton, but either one is... Is that East?

48:37.188 --> 48:38.430
East, that's the name, East.

48:38.950 --> 48:42.357
Okay, the last name is B-A-S-B.

48:42.457 --> 48:52.076
B as in boy, A-S-B, again, A-N-E-S, Basbanes, a Greek name.

48:52.376 --> 48:52.937
Okay.

48:53.759 --> 48:55.442
We get a lot of Greeks out there.

48:55.523 --> 48:56.545
Oh, we do, yeah.

48:56.565 --> 48:58.508
Yeah, I was a Jackson delegate, however.

48:58.609 --> 48:58.849
Were you?

48:59.082 --> 49:04.047
And I got 92 East Street, and that's 120 North Grafton, Mass.

49:04.087 --> 49:05.929
That's 120 PO Box 120.

49:06.250 --> 49:07.831
Okay, that's the PO Box.

49:07.851 --> 49:09.733
So that's two different addresses is what I'm saying.

49:09.753 --> 49:14.378
If you send it to 92 East Street, don't use the PO Box.

49:14.479 --> 49:15.580
What's your zip?

49:15.600 --> 49:16.100
01536.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.902
01536.

49:18.122 --> 49:19.624
And I'll find that Max Sander.

49:19.644 --> 49:21.806
You'll really love that Max Sander piece.

49:22.127 --> 49:22.407
I...

49:22.690 --> 49:24.052
I'm trying to remember.

49:24.112 --> 49:33.986
There was some poetry that he had written on the inside of one of those books that I looked at over there, too, that's somewhat similar to the piece that you're using in your opening.

49:34.006 --> 49:35.308
I'll see if I can find that.

49:35.869 --> 49:41.697
You know, I have everything there is now on Steve, all the way back to his baby book.

49:41.977 --> 49:45.422
You don't normally put this much into a case.

49:45.542 --> 49:46.784
Are you fascinated by it?

49:47.004 --> 49:47.665
Oh, yes, I am.

49:48.246 --> 49:49.848
And I'll tell you why I took this case.

49:50.229 --> 49:51.010
When I took this,

49:51.496 --> 50:04.796
I had just come down from a run of 13 straight homicide cases, 10 of which were either crack or cocaine related, and four of which had either perps or victims or both under the age of 15.

50:05.957 --> 50:13.128
And very frankly, the reason I took this case is it has no drugs in it, no guns, no violence, and no dead bodies.

50:13.288 --> 50:20.659
And I think probably in terms of my own mental health, this case was really a godsend because you get sick and burned out after a while.

50:21.331 --> 50:26.576
And it's nice to have a client that you can actually sort of like.

50:26.776 --> 50:29.739
Now, is he bathing?

50:29.759 --> 50:32.582
Oh, my wife is just hell on wheels with him.

50:32.622 --> 50:44.754
He shuttles back and forth between here at one of my employees' houses because, very frankly, the feds have put all these absurd restrictions on him.

50:44.794 --> 50:47.457
Their resistance is coming to Iowa at all.

50:47.926 --> 50:55.174
was his well-known proclivity to flight, quote-unquote, which is totally untrue, and his dangerousness to the community.

50:55.354 --> 50:56.155
Oh, please.

50:56.175 --> 50:59.699
And I got on the witness stand on that one, and I said, well, I just can't understand this.

50:59.759 --> 51:07.468
I've never seen anybody say to another person, your library books are your life, or give me that doorknob or I'll kill you.

51:07.488 --> 51:09.070
You know, at which point he does.

51:09.430 --> 51:11.313
Have you asked him about the doorknobs, though?

51:11.333 --> 51:11.653
Pardon me?

51:11.673 --> 51:13.495
What's the fascination with doorknobs?

51:14.048 --> 51:14.629
They're old.

51:14.729 --> 51:16.210
They're Victorian stuff.

51:16.230 --> 51:17.832
Yeah, but just doorknobs.

51:18.072 --> 51:20.274
Just doorknobs, yeah.

51:20.435 --> 51:27.962
Also, back to that Mormon thing, one of the things that he wanted, and this guy's a magical thinker, by the way.

51:29.043 --> 51:33.047
Are you hip to a magical thinker as opposed to a logical thinker?

51:33.428 --> 51:33.528
Yeah.

51:33.548 --> 51:34.769
Okay.

51:35.210 --> 51:43.158
He attributes aspects of living things to inanimate objects.

51:43.178 --> 51:43.498
Yeah.

51:43.715 --> 51:53.070
He's a very, you know, although the family is not religious, he is very spiritual and very magical.

51:53.912 --> 52:06.592
As a result, one of the things that he wanted very much was a doorknob from the Mormon tabernacle.

52:06.612 --> 52:09.617
You feel like he just stumbled into the twilight zone?

52:09.637 --> 52:10.178
You have...

52:10.900 --> 52:13.162
Okay, you say he's a little guy, right?

52:13.443 --> 52:18.848
Yeah, he's about five, five and a half, a hundred and twenty-five, a hundred and thirty-five.

52:18.928 --> 52:22.532
Last question, does he enjoy any kind of food or is just food just something necessary?

52:22.552 --> 52:24.033
He's a junk food junkie.

52:24.313 --> 52:26.496
How about women?

52:26.576 --> 52:29.879
No women, basically pretty sexualizingly ambivalent.

52:29.919 --> 52:35.845
And again, this goes back to some aspects of his childhood and specifically his mother's mental illness.

52:36.550 --> 52:41.874
He describes himself as bisexual, but he's never actually had a long-running relationship with anybody.

52:42.315 --> 52:48.760
I read women actually as a sexual interest, and I'm just curious if he had any kind of sexual interest.

52:48.780 --> 52:50.081
The books, the books were his life.

52:50.161 --> 52:51.202
The books were his life.

52:51.422 --> 53:01.131
He also, by the way, had a significant collection of Victorian pornography, including those, oh, I forgot one, stereopticon cards.

53:03.212 --> 53:06.355
Excuse me, he had 200,000 stereopticon cards.

53:06.689 --> 53:09.994
We're talking five zeros here, right, after two?

53:10.094 --> 53:11.856
200,000, you betcha.

53:13.719 --> 53:14.420
Tiles of them.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.363
And do we know the provenance of these?

53:17.104 --> 53:26.036
Most of those were, as far as I can determine, and they're almost impossible to trace, were in fact obtained at various antique shops and flea markets all over the nation.

53:26.056 --> 53:27.939
So perhaps obtained legitimately.

53:28.119 --> 53:29.101
Yeah.

53:29.121 --> 53:35.650
But, and again, Victorian scenes, primarily buildings, very, very seldom...

53:35.765 --> 53:37.147
Do you think he's a Victorian man?

53:37.527 --> 53:38.749
A Victorian person?

53:38.769 --> 53:40.231
Nick, he wears Victorian underwear.

53:42.454 --> 53:42.534
Wow.

53:42.554 --> 53:42.955
He does.

53:42.975 --> 53:52.228
I mean, he wears the short-sleeved, strapped-shouldered, flat-bottom union suits that were the standard male underwear for the Victorians.

53:52.248 --> 53:53.910
And we don't know how he got into this.

53:54.010 --> 53:55.332
It just happened.

53:55.352 --> 54:04.084
That I don't know, although I wish the guy could get some new ones, because the ones he's got are pretty damn funky, and when he's dancing around my house, it's kind of a distressing sight.

54:04.756 --> 54:09.041
This is wonderful.

54:09.061 --> 54:09.722
This is really great.

54:09.742 --> 54:18.894
Well, you know, you look at this situation from my perspective and it's sort of like being trapped in the weirdest crime novel ever written.

54:18.914 --> 54:23.300
I mean, every day is something new, something odd, something.

54:23.380 --> 54:28.787
Right now, for example, Stephen is dedicating himself to saving homeless people here in Des Moines.

54:29.027 --> 54:29.127
Sure.

54:29.461 --> 54:53.882
uh and so he goes down he hangs out under the bridges with him he tries to talk him into like going to the shelters and stuff he's as good-hearted as he can be um but he's never never held a job uh the family is by the way significantly wealthy he has absolutely no self-discipline whatsoever he's totally impulse controlled

54:55.043 --> 54:58.927
You know, 9 o'clock to him means any time between 7.30 and 11.

54:59.047 --> 55:08.997
He didn't even own or carry a watch until I absolutely insisted he do so so he could make his check-ins on time.

55:09.217 --> 55:13.021
Time is not relevant to him.

55:13.041 --> 55:14.502
Does he ever talk about the books?

55:14.783 --> 55:17.445
Oh, incessantly.

55:17.465 --> 55:18.947
You know, and he remembers them.

55:20.228 --> 55:21.469
There goes my other line.

55:21.489 --> 55:22.110
We'll talk next week.

55:22.190 --> 55:22.430
All right.

55:22.570 --> 55:23.431
Have a good one.

55:23.511 --> 55:24.212
Thanks, Ray.

55:24.232 --> 55:24.392
Bye-bye.
