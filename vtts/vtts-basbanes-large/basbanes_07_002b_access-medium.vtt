00:02.292 --> 00:08.762
Is it true that after the great Chicago fire, the Queen Victoria sent some money for a library?

00:08.862 --> 00:10.344
I've heard that, yeah.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.326
I guess it's true.

00:11.346 --> 00:16.794
To replace the library that was destroyed, but the irony is there was no library that was lost in the fire.

00:16.814 --> 00:17.194
So what?

00:17.976 --> 00:19.258
Somebody mentioned that to me.

00:19.278 --> 00:20.579
Yeah, I've heard that story.

00:20.660 --> 00:22.022
I'd like to nail that down.

00:22.743 --> 00:24.826
I'm going to tell all these little kinds of stories.

00:25.206 --> 00:27.109
So all these things were happening at this point.

00:27.350 --> 00:30.915
Give me just a little background on yourself, the biographical stuff that...

00:31.638 --> 00:34.481
I'm someone who came here as a student and never left.

00:36.423 --> 00:39.447
Came here in 72 to do graduate work in history.

00:42.150 --> 00:46.435
Decided fairly early on that I really wasn't primarily interested in teaching.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.237
Wasn't sure I had a vocation for teaching.

00:49.378 --> 00:50.720
But I knew I wanted to be an academic.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.002
Well, what's the other way you can be an academic?

00:53.163 --> 00:54.504
You can be an academic librarian.

00:55.706 --> 01:01.392
And at that point, I guess I thought I could get in through the back door and wouldn't have to go to library school.

01:02.047 --> 01:05.251
which longer ago would have been true, but isn't true anymore.

01:08.095 --> 01:20.611
So I got a job here in Special Collections while I was writing my dissertation as a way of testing this idea of, you know, what would it be like to be a librarian, and decided that I definitely liked it.

01:20.651 --> 01:24.276
And Bob Rosenthal convinced me that I really did need to go to library school.

01:24.296 --> 01:27.160
So after I got my PhD in history,

01:28.118 --> 01:29.961
I went to library school here.

01:30.101 --> 01:31.484
So you've been here for 18 years?

01:31.504 --> 01:33.307
I have been here for 18 years, yeah.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.529
And how are you from Illinois?

01:35.751 --> 01:38.516
I was born downstate and then grew up in Indiana.

01:39.417 --> 01:42.944
So Chicago has always been the closest big city for me.

01:43.164 --> 01:45.127
What's the best way to drive to Bloomington from here?

01:47.932 --> 01:51.378
Let's say I get on Lakeshore Drive, right, and take it down to one of those interstates?

01:51.919 --> 01:52.540
Yeah.

01:53.684 --> 01:54.265
Right.

01:54.966 --> 02:00.955
In Gary, you can get I-65, which angles down to Indianapolis.

02:01.035 --> 02:02.477
I'm going to check my map tonight.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.701
I figured somebody from Indiana might focus on those.

02:04.721 --> 02:08.527
Yeah, I-65 from Gary to Indianapolis, and then Kwan's on.

02:09.448 --> 02:10.329
Tell me.

02:10.550 --> 02:11.311
Let's start again.

02:11.511 --> 02:14.556
When Haven O'Moore was here, he stopped by to see Bob Rosenthal.

02:14.616 --> 02:16.238
He was in Chicago for something else.

02:16.298 --> 02:17.200
How did he know Rosenthal?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.143
He's there.

02:19.163 --> 02:21.987
I know Book Connections somehow.

02:23.384 --> 02:34.041
And I remember Bob took him down to the vault, and there was something that his eyes lighted on immediately in the Regenstein section of the vault.

02:34.061 --> 02:35.022
And he pulled it off and looked at it.

02:35.142 --> 02:36.444
I wish I could remember what it was.

02:36.584 --> 02:38.127
I can't think what it was.

02:38.227 --> 02:42.093
He pulled something off, and he said, you know, when she bought this, I was a runner-up.

02:44.697 --> 02:44.797
Oh.

02:45.098 --> 02:50.706
Because he spotted that immediately, and that was what he thought of.

02:50.947 --> 02:51.788
When did she buy it?

02:53.303 --> 02:55.827
It would have been something in the 70s sometime.

02:56.087 --> 02:56.267
Yeah.

02:57.629 --> 03:03.337
According to George Laurie at Swan's, he had just started, he told me about when Hayden just arrived in the scene.

03:03.358 --> 03:06.442
He said he was like a meteor flashing across the sky.

03:07.163 --> 03:08.525
Because we didn't know what to make of him.

03:08.545 --> 03:09.046
He scared us.

03:09.707 --> 03:13.011
He scared us because, you know, all of a sudden a new person arrives.

03:13.372 --> 03:16.897
He said he was runner-up to Mrs. Regenstein.

03:17.538 --> 03:21.724
Yeah, so it was something, it would have been something in English or American lit.

03:22.109 --> 03:23.665
It had to be a major thing, too.
