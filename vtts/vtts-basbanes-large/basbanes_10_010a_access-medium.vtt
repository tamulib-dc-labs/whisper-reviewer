WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:06.921
Where are we right now, precisely?

00:07.241 --> 00:13.147
We're heading that way.

00:13.628 --> 00:25.380
So this is really the gate to the Acropolis right here.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.602
It's the formal gate.

00:27.642 --> 00:30.805
The gate.

00:31.226 --> 00:32.407
Oh, I see.

00:32.427 --> 00:32.687
Okay.

00:32.937 --> 00:41.531
Yes, this is a Yol.

00:41.671 --> 00:44.856
This is a Yol.

00:44.877 --> 00:47.300
This is a Yol.

00:47.581 --> 00:52.549
This is a Yol.

00:53.677 --> 01:13.272
Which is over here, but the houses over here, these would have been...

01:14.045 --> 01:18.551
Famous library, rival to the Egyptian Iskander.

01:18.571 --> 01:20.074
But where, right here?

01:20.534 --> 01:21.956
Just left-hand side.

01:21.976 --> 01:22.938
Where those columns are?

01:22.958 --> 01:23.118
Yes.

01:23.418 --> 01:24.700
Oh, can I go down there?

01:24.900 --> 01:25.701
We'll have to go right now.

01:25.942 --> 01:27.865
We will go, we will go.

01:27.885 --> 01:28.666
He's briefing you.

01:28.686 --> 01:30.608
Yes, I know.

01:31.069 --> 01:33.893
Why was the library here, do you think?

01:34.396 --> 01:37.220
This is a good place.

01:38.903 --> 01:41.586
This is a good place.

01:41.606 --> 01:43.028
This is a good place.

01:43.069 --> 01:50.599
This is a good place.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.206
This is a good place.

01:55.186 --> 02:01.674
200,000 pieces, as you know.

02:01.754 --> 02:02.515
As I know, yes.

02:02.535 --> 02:05.039
Topographic location is suitable for the library.

02:05.399 --> 02:06.140
I don't know why.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.842
Which way are we facing now?

02:08.143 --> 02:11.527
L-shaped.

02:12.248 --> 02:12.688
Like this.

02:12.969 --> 02:14.591
But I mean, that is what direction?

02:14.631 --> 02:14.871
North?

02:14.911 --> 02:16.613
To west.

02:16.633 --> 02:17.515
That's to the west.

02:17.955 --> 02:20.198
So the library faces to the west.

02:20.414 --> 02:24.123
We're looking out to the west, off that ridge there.

02:24.203 --> 02:33.084
And it was shaped like an L. Two-story building.

02:33.365 --> 02:38.457
The entrance from second story, from upper level.

02:38.639 --> 02:46.146
The directors of the library, states, and their houses over here.

02:47.427 --> 02:48.949
Where were the volumes kept?

02:48.969 --> 02:50.630
Books, here?

02:50.690 --> 02:54.874
There are three readings.

02:54.954 --> 02:59.519
How do we know all this, by the way?

03:00.920 --> 03:04.984
I joined the Eastern of the North Star Library.

03:04.964 --> 03:10.199
According to this trouble, the Peridomian Library was built during the time of Emenes II.

03:10.820 --> 03:17.539
However, it must antedate the store, since the rooms of the library did not have doors open on the street or square.

03:17.924 --> 03:23.053
Those who wishes to enter the library had to proceed from the upper story of the north star.

03:23.173 --> 03:23.714
Which is there.

03:23.754 --> 03:25.958
The south wall of the library has disappeared.

03:26.179 --> 03:30.506
So the interior of the four rooms of structure is now visible from the south.

03:30.547 --> 03:31.729
That's the south side over here.

03:31.869 --> 03:37.519
Above the north star of the Athena Temenos.

03:37.668 --> 03:40.511
That part is the attention.

03:40.631 --> 03:41.952
That's part of the library too?

03:43.273 --> 03:47.397
The upper part of the theater.

03:48.078 --> 03:53.003
This is so exciting.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.966
This is so exciting for me, it really is.

03:56.006 --> 03:58.889
And this is all library here, right?

03:58.969 --> 04:01.631
I want to see everything, but this is really most important to me.

04:01.651 --> 04:03.373
I have to spend some time here.

04:03.753 --> 04:05.515
When the stores are being erected,

04:05.849 --> 04:09.898
The second story of the North Shore is constructed to give access to the library.

04:10.339 --> 04:14.028
One of the first works of the 38-year reign of Eminence II.

04:15.371 --> 04:18.137
So we're standing east to our back.

04:18.177 --> 04:20.382
Actually, the sun is going that way, so that's west.

04:20.699 --> 04:21.881
Exactly west.

04:23.443 --> 04:26.026
North, south, east, west.

04:26.146 --> 04:26.967
North.

04:27.027 --> 04:30.051
And where was the palace?

04:30.251 --> 04:33.155
For instance, what is that?

04:33.315 --> 04:34.917
What is that?

04:35.258 --> 04:40.885
What is this?

04:41.202 --> 04:46.249
Some Helanistic periods from here?

04:46.269 --> 04:46.930
Yeah, from here.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.533
He just found here.

04:48.553 --> 04:50.956
Does he want it back?

04:50.996 --> 04:52.298
Yeah, you can keep.

04:52.478 --> 04:52.939
I can keep?

04:53.059 --> 04:55.603
He says, yeah.

04:58.487 --> 05:00.149
I only have to ask once.

05:02.613 --> 05:03.514
Oh, my goodness.

05:03.832 --> 05:10.523
Does he think that was from the façade of the library?

05:10.824 --> 05:11.685
That piece that he gave me?

05:14.209 --> 05:15.171
That piece that he gave me?

05:15.852 --> 05:18.055
But Sautrim Park has lost.

05:18.496 --> 05:20.820
Now what is this?

05:23.905 --> 05:24.326
Sister?

05:24.386 --> 05:26.329
Sister, yeah.

05:26.444 --> 05:35.714
There are 18 systems providing for water.

05:35.734 --> 05:41.440
This is just the Kral Emenos and Atholos.

05:42.661 --> 05:50.869
It's a specific system for King Emenos and Atholos.

05:50.889 --> 05:55.354
It's okay.

05:55.503 --> 06:01.152
There were some renovations during Roman and Byzantine times.

06:01.173 --> 06:04.618
This is the biggest one, providing the palaces.

06:04.939 --> 06:07.183
King Atholos and Omenes II.

06:08.325 --> 06:09.086
How do we know that?

06:10.228 --> 06:11.530
There are specific areas.

06:15.997 --> 06:19.603
Because of the library, you know, there are a lot of documents left.

06:20.124 --> 06:20.565
Wow.

06:25.945 --> 06:39.306
So it wasn't built of marble, was it?

06:40.608 --> 06:45.456
Yeah, mostly marble, but I think they are stolen.

06:56.573 --> 06:58.995
So the L shape went like this.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.863
The L shape went like that.

07:06.883 --> 07:09.025
And the books were probably kept in there.

07:09.365 --> 07:10.366
Lower part.

07:10.386 --> 07:14.590
There are three whole books kept there.

07:14.610 --> 07:15.191
Lower part.

07:16.011 --> 07:16.672
That's wonderful.

07:17.853 --> 07:22.918
This to me is worth the whole trip.

07:23.118 --> 07:32.428
We will see later on just make a brief tour, okay?

07:33.349 --> 07:50.188
Okay, and I'd like to walk around a little bit Oh

07:53.392 --> 07:58.318
I just left the library, which faces the west.

08:01.602 --> 08:08.230
Are you enjoying yourself?

08:08.571 --> 08:08.871
Yes.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.297
It's a chance, as I told you before, you know.

08:13.317 --> 08:15.559
But tell me again while my machine is on about these.

08:16.100 --> 08:22.588
You know, in the nomadic tribes, such as Turkmen, you know, my father is a nomadic.

08:22.990 --> 08:36.287
Turk, they used to use this piece of cloth, such sort of things, especially in a sacred place, for the good wishes.

08:37.308 --> 08:37.989
Good luck.

08:38.129 --> 08:45.499
Good luck, yeah.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.361
This is so great.

08:51.070 --> 08:53.372
This is really spectacular, isn't it?

08:53.392 --> 08:54.834
This is what we saw from the city.

08:55.595 --> 08:56.195
This is Roman period.

08:56.215 --> 08:56.476
Roman period.

08:56.496 --> 08:56.996

20 yılda tamamlanmış 20 bin işçi ve mimarın çalıştığı bir tapınak.

09:29.039 --> 09:35.768
Akropol'un en dik noktasına inşa edilmiş ve bu iki kişi kendilerini Tanrı ilan edip taptırmışlar.

09:35.788 --> 09:38.833
Burası bir tapınma yeri değil.

09:39.494 --> 09:41.597
Tapınma yeri değil, bir mimari.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.001
Görkemin ortaya konduğu bir yer.

09:46.283 --> 09:49.107
Sütun başlıklarıyla, saçaklıklarıyla

09:49.289 --> 10:16.765
During the reign of two Roman emperors, Trianus and Hadrianus, they constructed that temple but not as for pilgrim or praying but for it's a way of showing their

10:17.133 --> 10:21.840
And they declared themselves as a god.

10:22.380 --> 10:26.786
And they forced the people to pray for themselves.

10:26.807 --> 10:30.472
Where does he believe they quarried the marble for this temple?

10:30.492 --> 10:31.253
Yes.

10:31.293 --> 10:34.698
Where did they quarry the marble for this temple?

10:34.718 --> 10:37.041
Where did they quarry the marble for this temple?

10:37.061 --> 10:38.503
There is a river from 45 kilometers away.

10:38.923 --> 10:40.686
There is a river here at the same time.

10:40.766 --> 10:41.487
There is granite and marble.

10:41.905 --> 10:53.653
They bring the marble and the granite

10:53.988 --> 10:56.071
From that part of the mountain.

10:56.111 --> 10:57.714
It's beautiful marble, it's striking.

10:58.636 --> 11:03.123
The brown one and the zeich.

11:03.504 --> 11:06.168
The brown one and the zeich.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.513
The brown one and the zeich.

11:09.574 --> 11:15.984
The brown one and the zeich.

11:16.285 --> 11:19.590
The brown one and the zeich.

11:19.807 --> 11:22.190
Mermer Roma Döneminin yapı malzemesi.

11:22.270 --> 11:29.158
Marble is a Roman period mostly in Roman period used.

11:29.238 --> 11:32.943
Granite are the helenistik döneminin yapı malzemesi.

11:36.027 --> 11:46.920
Marble become very popular in Roman times and new technology used to carry it and process it in Roman times mostly.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.582
In helenistik period granite

11:48.848 --> 11:57.237
The director says that over 20,000 people worked here and completed the temple within 20 years.

11:57.938 --> 11:58.198
Wow.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.982
So this was okay.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.064
Where was the palace?

12:03.584 --> 12:06.467
Oh, we passed it.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.491
I see.

12:10.672 --> 12:15.497
He said the general's houses, those are on the palaces.

12:16.238 --> 12:16.999
Right-hand side.

12:17.232 --> 12:18.193
of the entrance.

12:20.775 --> 12:22.637
Yes, they are.

12:22.657 --> 12:25.700
Group one, group two, group three on the right hand side.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.604
Those are residences and palaces.

12:29.624 --> 12:42.476
This is really something.

12:42.916 --> 12:43.797
Wow.

12:44.114 --> 12:56.975
The system is closed.

12:57.957 --> 13:02.985
And they check the level of the water.

13:03.005 --> 13:06.811
There are some scales on the column.

13:07.012 --> 13:10.257
This was only for the temples.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.004
Water.

13:11.464 --> 13:16.451
Water provided by this system to the temple.

13:16.972 --> 13:22.640
And the ocean again is... This way, sir.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.441
This way.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.303
So on a clear day, can you see it from here?

13:26.945 --> 13:31.432
Yeah, definitely.

13:31.452 --> 13:37.560
That kind of chariot.

13:37.793 --> 14:04.932

14:05.789 --> 14:09.775
