WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:06.490
Go ahead.

00:06.510 --> 00:06.770
I'm sorry.

00:07.471 --> 00:15.781
I guess I'm interested in the different periods the press is going through.

00:15.801 --> 00:19.126
I don't know much about what it was like in its earliest years.

00:19.146 --> 00:21.148
I know something.

00:21.168 --> 00:26.875
And I don't know anything really about now except for the astonishing number of books that keep appearing.

00:28.898 --> 00:33.784
Well, it's amazing all the successful things they've done, too, which is the art

00:34.388 --> 00:36.852
blind, the annals of communism.

00:38.454 --> 00:47.868
And then every once in a while you do see the Yale younger poetry, which I think is wonderful, and I've had a nice interview with John Hollander.

00:47.888 --> 00:54.558
And that's kind of a thing where you're really fulfilling an obligation, I think, to American culture.

00:54.659 --> 00:56.521
I don't think it's stretching it to say that.

00:56.662 --> 01:03.552
Those may be books, of which we publish fewer than a thousand, some of them.

01:03.920 --> 01:10.510
But you talk to people like Helen Bendler, for instance, at Harvard Lake, for my new book.

01:10.530 --> 01:17.662
And she just believes that the old series is just so essential to the continued production of American poetry.

01:17.982 --> 01:19.084
It's that relevant.

01:19.124 --> 01:21.427
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.511
And because it is a very serious project.

01:24.052 --> 01:26.896
And the fact that one person, it's not being done by a committee.

01:27.757 --> 01:28.138
It's really...

01:29.266 --> 01:37.096
I kind of like that, because how much art is done by committee when you think about it?

01:37.116 --> 01:37.377
That's right.

01:37.397 --> 01:37.637
Very little.

01:37.657 --> 01:46.328
Well, the press has always taken that seriously, and I don't think there was ever any thought that we couldn't afford it or there was too much trouble or anything.

01:46.348 --> 01:48.972
It's always been considered an important part of it.

01:48.992 --> 01:51.014
Well, it's something that you have to do.

01:51.034 --> 01:51.215
Yeah.

01:51.735 --> 01:59.205
And the editor who has handled it, and there have been several, always enjoyed it.

02:00.856 --> 02:08.226
It's one of the many things.

02:08.246 --> 02:18.439
I think there has, as I said, always been a spirit in this press of doing the best we can do with the resources we have for the world of scholarship.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.283
I think it's somewhat different now.

02:21.343 --> 02:25.588
I don't think editors handle special fields anymore.

02:25.608 --> 02:26.489
I don't know.

02:26.610 --> 02:27.491
More generalists.

02:27.671 --> 02:29.513
I think they are.

02:29.734 --> 02:30.795
I don't know.

02:31.282 --> 02:36.009
since it's been 17 years, since I sat in this... Is this right?

02:36.049 --> 02:37.612
We're in your... This very spot.

02:37.792 --> 02:38.393
No kidding.

02:38.413 --> 02:38.994
How many times?

02:39.014 --> 02:41.137
I didn't think I'd ever look out that window again.

02:41.157 --> 02:41.838
Well, there you go.

02:42.299 --> 02:44.462
That building was... When's the last time you were here?

02:44.582 --> 02:54.577
That wing was not... Well, I don't think I sat here for 17 years, so... Well, that's exciting.

02:55.338 --> 02:58.202
I'm already... You're in the right office.

02:58.223 --> 02:59.905
I'm pleased to... Well, you'll think of it.

03:00.172 --> 03:01.253
jacket with the clams.

03:01.273 --> 03:03.155
Isn't that great for the encyclopedia?

03:03.175 --> 03:03.696
Yes.

03:04.877 --> 03:05.358
Yes.

03:05.618 --> 03:06.819
I was talking to Nancy yesterday.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.583
I mean, they went through about 20 iterations of that.

03:10.003 --> 03:10.464
Really?

03:10.504 --> 03:11.845
Before coming up with the clams.

03:12.426 --> 03:17.972
I love it, because there's no cliche aspect to it, and yet it still resonates as New England.

03:17.992 --> 03:23.698
And that's in there, the encyclopedia of New England, the West, New York, Ireland, the Holocaust.

03:23.718 --> 03:29.605
Yes, we always want, Chester wanted to do more encyclopedias, and they were hard to

03:30.428 --> 03:32.852
I know Ed Tripp.

03:34.113 --> 03:38.420
Was the Encyclopedia of North New York City one that he... Oh, yeah, that's it.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.027
I think that is one that he handled.

03:43.047 --> 03:44.909
Edited by Kenneth T. Jackson.

03:44.929 --> 03:45.530
Oh, yes.

03:46.231 --> 03:47.033
But that, of course.

03:47.053 --> 03:52.461
But Chester always wanted good backlist books.

03:52.541 --> 03:56.326
Might not sell a lot in any year, but would keep selling year after year.

03:57.088 --> 04:00.132
So that's a good question for me, the importance of the backlist.

04:00.618 --> 04:14.934
Oh, well, we paid a lot of attention to that, and if we had a book that might become a backlist book, well, that was always of interest to the director.

04:15.615 --> 04:24.905
Or if it looked as though it might be a backlist book, and we didn't think it would be a backlist book, that was also... Well, was that always in the front of your deliberations?

04:24.925 --> 04:25.306
Oh, no.

04:25.326 --> 04:27.368
Not in the front, but it was there.

04:27.803 --> 04:30.146
Is this book going to stick around for a while?

04:30.506 --> 04:35.111
And then once we started publishing paper bounds, is it a potential paper bound?

04:35.231 --> 04:37.514
Because that's another form of backlist.

04:37.534 --> 04:38.054
It sure is.

04:38.435 --> 04:47.985
So we kept putting more and more books into paper bound form, and I guess I think they've done well.

04:48.907 --> 04:57.456
Does it surprise you that arguably, I say arguably because I haven't seen the figures, but if not the number one best-selling book

04:57.976 --> 05:01.284
The number two is a work of fiction.

05:01.625 --> 05:02.808
Long Day's Journey Into Night.

05:03.530 --> 05:04.592
Oh, yes.

05:04.612 --> 05:09.825
Is the number one still... Well, according to John, it was... It used to be...

05:10.430 --> 05:12.052
The Lonely Crowd?

05:12.613 --> 05:14.376
It's still number one?

05:14.716 --> 05:19.603
Well, it's been going since... I had never heard of this book until I started this project.

05:19.944 --> 05:25.311
I had read it before I came to the press, but I had no idea it was the ill press.

05:25.411 --> 05:28.135
What explains a phenomenon like that?

05:29.838 --> 05:30.479
I don't know.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.722
It was written.

05:32.742 --> 05:39.812
It just happened to appeal to people as an analysis of our society.

05:40.113 --> 05:44.258
And that is a wonderful title.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.760
Isn't it wonderful?

05:46.120 --> 05:49.144
It's kind of an oxymoron when you think about it.

05:49.164 --> 05:50.345
Yes, wonderful.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.548
So I'm interested.

05:52.588 --> 05:54.690
That's still selling, I guess.

05:54.710 --> 05:56.312
Apparently it's still the number one.

05:57.574 --> 06:02.680
And I'd never heard of it until it was not only identified to me as the number one, but I said, you're kidding.

06:03.341 --> 06:04.762
Tell me about this book.

06:04.782 --> 06:08.787
In the university world, many, many, many, many people have heard of it.

06:09.020 --> 06:09.601
Oh, sure.

06:09.781 --> 06:14.169
Oh, and I'll know everything I need to know about it by the time I read it.

06:14.189 --> 06:15.471
You may even read it.

06:15.511 --> 06:16.553
I may have to, you know.

06:16.633 --> 06:17.515
Interesting book.

06:19.177 --> 06:23.445
What else do you think I need before we conclude?

06:23.485 --> 06:27.492
Who else have you talked to who's been retired for these many years?

06:27.712 --> 06:34.183
Well, really, Ed Morgan I talked to, and John, of course.

06:34.838 --> 06:38.562
But in terms of retirees, it's just the three of you so far.

06:38.582 --> 06:39.263
Retired Press?

06:40.124 --> 06:40.545
Yeah.

06:40.625 --> 06:41.546
Who are the other two?

06:42.287 --> 06:42.687
No, no.

06:43.308 --> 06:45.951
You're the first Retired Press, actually.

06:46.852 --> 06:50.256
Well, there are other people around now.

06:50.777 --> 07:00.188
I don't know what kind of thing you want to... You know, I think what I want to do is do these 20 interviews, and I just establish that number for myself.
