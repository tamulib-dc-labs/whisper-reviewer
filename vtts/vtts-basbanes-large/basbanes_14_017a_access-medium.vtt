WEBVTT

00:05.566 --> 00:17.943
I couldn't believe you.

00:17.963 --> 00:23.691
I was ready to receive this.

00:23.712 --> 00:28.098
This is Roger Shatley, his family, the opera, who are asking me to say a few words about the great opera that Grace Hayes does.

00:28.118 --> 00:29.800
She will speak to us, she will read to us, she will write down the other questions.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.202
I'll say a few things, which is her art is not all an art of economy.

00:32.380 --> 00:43.285
So, a nurse and I, as such a pupil here, can just measure up in what human voices mean and produce.

00:43.872 --> 01:05.137
Somebody lent me her book, not such a very long ago, and I knew that this book was a writer who really mattered to the person who kindly lent me, in that this person was torn by the way that I should eat the book, and then I should return it.

01:05.157 --> 01:05.697
I can see the similarities.

01:05.717 --> 01:10.723
I did return it because I invested the book on it, invested it at Book of Writing.

01:10.703 --> 01:21.795
And I then, the private office, so that the daughters of mine could share in this right with great conviction and great clarity.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.121
Grace Bailey does this very, very company in the area tonight.

01:24.141 --> 01:24.342
Thank you.

01:47.947 --> 01:52.092
That's great.

01:56.417 --> 02:02.564
Well, it works.

02:02.905 --> 02:15.439
I want to read a couple of things.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.802
The Phillips is at our point

02:17.950 --> 02:21.495
Then I'm going to read a couple of stories of my own.

02:22.396 --> 02:27.563
And then what I really would like to do is to answer questions about that.

02:28.504 --> 02:41.342
And if you don't ask me the questions that I want to answer, I'll ask them myself.

02:41.322 --> 02:50.590
Because it's always bad if you want to live a place and haven't said exactly what you wanted.

02:50.650 --> 02:57.856
That's because of your beliefs and participatory democracy.

02:57.876 --> 03:00.819
But I do want to begin with this.

03:05.303 --> 03:11.228
And I read this from time to time, so don't take too many notes.

03:18.515 --> 03:31.073
I've lost my voice at the end of the story, and somebody else had to finish it for me, so they end up in your own country.

03:32.369 --> 03:34.492
Interesting things.

03:34.512 --> 03:39.779
They're from the book called The Technicians of the Sacred.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.502
There are a lot of work together.

03:41.522 --> 03:45.487
Some of these translations are probably going to be slightly different.

03:45.607 --> 03:52.417
And I think I've lost most of the rest of the book.

03:52.437 --> 03:54.580
But these are from...

03:54.813 --> 04:08.676
The statements on art and poetry by the first is, this one is on storytelling, that's why I want to read it.

04:08.756 --> 04:14.946
The first one is on storytelling, the second one is on criticism, that's why I bring this all together.

04:15.507 --> 04:18.812
This is a statement by Carlo, and after the Bushman,

04:19.906 --> 04:24.852
I must first sit a little, holding my arms, but the fatigue may go out of them because I sit.

04:25.793 --> 04:33.904
I do merely listen, watching for a story which I want to hear, while I sit waiting for it that it may flow into my ear.

04:33.964 --> 04:40.632
These are those through which I am listening to all my ears while I feel that I sit silent.

04:41.641 --> 04:48.411
I'm most late listening behind me while I listen along the road, while I feel that my name flows along the road.

04:48.451 --> 04:59.447
They, my three names, flow backwards with my ears to my feet's heels on which I went, which I feel that the story is in the wind.

04:59.467 --> 05:09.842
If the story is won't to flow along to another place, then our names do pass through those people while they do not perceive our bodies go along.

05:10.042 --> 05:14.148
For our names are those which, floating, reach a different place.

05:15.069 --> 05:17.753
The mountains lie between the two different roads.

05:18.554 --> 05:21.358
A man's name passes behind the mountain's back.

05:22.280 --> 05:29.851
Those names with which, returning, he goes forward.

05:30.191 --> 05:37.602
This is an Aztec statement, which I kind of live by.

05:40.012 --> 05:41.374
I mean, I hope I do.

05:41.515 --> 05:45.061
You know, you don't always live by what you really think you do.

05:46.925 --> 05:52.815
The artist, disciple, abundant, multiple, restless.

05:53.717 --> 05:58.105
The true artist, capable, practicing, skillful.

05:59.013 --> 06:02.840
maintains dialogue in his heart, meets things of the mind.

06:03.762 --> 06:22.776
The true artist draws out all from the heart, works with delight, makes things with calm, with sagacity, works like a true pole deck, composes objects, works dexterously, invents, arranges material, adorns, makes them adjust.

06:23.330 --> 06:45.160
They carry an artist, works at random, smears the people, makes things opaque, brushes across the surface of the face of things, works without care, defrauds people in the theater.

06:48.524 --> 06:49.185
My mom,

06:49.553 --> 07:14.464
I was talking to Roger about some of this and I was thinking about stories and can you open any back there by the way?

07:14.731 --> 07:16.933
You told me about stories.

07:16.953 --> 07:22.119
People are always saying to you, if you're a story writer, I mean, I don't say to you if you're a poet.

07:22.139 --> 07:30.908
Nobody says to you if you're a poet, did Daniel speak a lot of poetry around the house?

07:30.928 --> 07:36.975
If you're a story writer, everybody says, was there a real story, tell her at home?

07:37.075 --> 07:40.198
This all comes from the whole history thing.

07:40.178 --> 07:43.523
And so, I say no.

07:43.583 --> 07:49.931
There wasn't, but everybody talked a lot.

07:51.393 --> 07:54.858
And if everybody talks a lot, very often stories escape.

07:58.042 --> 08:05.132
But there was never any intention for anybody to say, I will now tell you a story.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.435
Sometimes people say,

08:07.735 --> 08:12.722
You know what happened the other day, but that's as far as it went.

08:13.383 --> 08:27.362
But in the midst of all the story and in the midst of thinking about stories, I did try to think about what stories I knew and I realized that I knew a lot of biblical stories.

08:28.383 --> 08:35.413
And this was very odd because I came with a religiously atheistic family

08:36.406 --> 08:54.015
And someone saw that, well, it was hard when I came over and I told my father that I had gone to services.

08:54.235 --> 08:58.262
He really had been quite angry.

08:59.035 --> 09:16.892
But at the same time, at the same time, our family were sort of typical Russian Jews, immigrants, socialists, with

09:17.243 --> 09:24.973
with experiences in Russia, in Siberia and various other places of that sort.

09:25.915 --> 09:39.573
And they came to this country when they were probably 20 or 21 and learned English pretty quickly because they learned Italian first.

09:39.593 --> 09:42.036
I don't know why.

09:42.016 --> 09:48.585
I think they lived in the kind of neighborhood of Paris.

09:48.906 --> 09:50.107
Actually, it was my father.

09:51.189 --> 10:10.977
But the thing about these stories was that with this anti-religious feeling that my family had with my father, we also had a very strong, I almost call it an attachment to being Jewish, but

10:10.957 --> 10:14.282
a kind of lighting on it, I should say.

10:14.302 --> 10:18.368
It was not something they didn't want, they didn't want.

10:18.969 --> 10:24.697
So that I rather have inherited it, or at least felt good about it.

10:25.318 --> 10:36.495
But I thought first of these biblical stories, and of course, when we talked about things to read, I thought maybe I'd read something.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.900
But then I thought, everybody knows all those stories anyway.

10:40.049 --> 10:47.157
And then when I thought that, I realized that there were a lot of stories people didn't know.

10:47.197 --> 11:04.977
Particularly in Judges, which I came to like a whole lot, because it was so terrible, so local, so scary, so truth-telling,

11:05.125 --> 11:08.231
you know, so on sentimentally.

11:10.836 --> 11:23.421
And partly really because of that book, I tend to like the whole book even more, feeling that hardness in it and that determination

11:23.401 --> 11:32.860
to tell the history of the way, the old way it really happened, how life was lived, and how long Google was.

11:33.621 --> 11:35.225
And not too long it is, you know?

11:36.086 --> 11:42.439
And I want you to say this, but I thought I shouldn't, and then I think I will.

11:42.419 --> 12:03.982
Also, it made a lot of the first of the New Testament seem more of a kind of propagandistic, in the sense that they wanted you to become a Christian, you know, if you read this, you actually, my vision was, this Old Testament doesn't even want you to become a Jew.

12:04.002 --> 12:07.245
They don't want you to ever become a Jew or not.

12:07.225 --> 12:20.293
What they really want is that the Jews they got shoot the head better.

12:20.554 --> 12:25.845
And they tell those scary stories.

12:25.865 --> 12:27.208
So a family

12:27.712 --> 12:34.824
You know, how badly they behave, then they don't say to you right off that they're behaving badly.

12:35.064 --> 12:37.849
They say, well, you get the idea.

12:37.869 --> 12:44.640
Of course, you don't get the idea until well after the New Testament has proliferated so much.

12:44.873 --> 12:53.664
But I just thought I'd read this one part, this one poem, which I guess was something said in the book I read.

12:53.684 --> 12:59.091
It was 900 years before the Common Era, as we said.

12:59.111 --> 13:11.607
And it's in Judges and it's the story of

13:11.755 --> 13:15.340
After Gideon, I want to think of that.

13:15.360 --> 13:28.298
Every part of Judges begins and then the people forgot and began to forget and went there to a false cause.

13:28.499 --> 13:30.702
Every single child would start with things like that.

13:30.762 --> 13:32.084
They made them do that.

13:32.104 --> 13:35.689
No sooner than they cleaned up their act, that's what they do.

13:35.709 --> 13:40.075
So in this case, after Gideon won this battle, then he had 70 sons.

13:41.725 --> 13:46.596
It's a very polite environment that says, the heirs, he had many words.

13:48.199 --> 13:50.725
You know why.

13:51.927 --> 14:01.388
And so, but one of the stuff that wasn't so good, it was a

14:01.739 --> 14:12.272
And he proceeded to kill the others.

14:13.273 --> 14:16.397
But he didn't do it right away.

14:16.657 --> 14:26.008
He first asked the people, he went to his mother's town, and he asked them, would they prefer to have 70 of these?

14:25.988 --> 14:36.531
was reigning over them, or would he just, um, how about, how about it was just him?

14:36.551 --> 14:41.382
They, they felt a certain logic there.

14:42.104 --> 14:47.251
I mean, they saw this problem with 70 people, so they said he should go down there.

14:47.271 --> 14:48.873
So he said, okay.

14:48.893 --> 15:08.601
But there was another son, one of his sons, and he saw how bad this son, Melophus, who, by the way, killed his father, Gideon, or Jeroboam, and Jocko, Jocko went out and he climbed the hill, and he stood on top of the hill,

15:08.581 --> 15:24.344
Now, you have to understand that one of the reasons I like this is really because of my politics and because I believe in many speeches on soapboxes and I believe in doing that.

15:24.484 --> 15:37.744
And one of the saddest things that's happened, I think, in my life was the end of the soapbox speaker in New York and I suppose everywhere else, naturally.

15:38.197 --> 15:43.171
But, um... Excuse me.

15:43.933 --> 15:46.982
It's a question.

15:47.002 --> 15:47.925
It's a question.

15:47.945 --> 15:49.168
But this is...

15:50.954 --> 15:55.038
So he got up there, got up there to make his speech, and this is the one he made.

15:55.098 --> 15:56.340
It's a really wonderful poem.

15:57.140 --> 15:59.263
And it's a very, very old one, as I said.

15:59.423 --> 16:03.567
And I'm sure there must be five people in this room who know everything about it, you know.

16:03.827 --> 16:05.509
I learned that from being here for two days.

16:05.569 --> 16:09.313
And they can tell me later.

16:09.713 --> 16:16.721
Anyway, this is Jockum's speech, his poem speech.

16:16.741 --> 16:19.864
If you've always made poem speeches, that would be good, too.

16:20.823 --> 16:23.706
He says, now listen to me, you people.

16:25.628 --> 16:29.832
The trees went forth, you think this album may all be so great, but listen to me.

16:30.693 --> 16:37.760
The trees went forth on a time to a man who came over them, and they said unto the olive tree, rain thou over us.

16:38.261 --> 16:47.070
But the olive tree said unto them, shall I leave my fatness, where with upon me they honor God and man and gold to be a promoter of the trees?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.273
And the tree said to the fig tree,

16:50.405 --> 16:52.108
Come now and bring all of us.

16:52.609 --> 17:00.263
But the fifth tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness and my root fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?

17:01.606 --> 17:05.333
Then said the trees unto the vine, Come now and bring all of us.

17:06.054 --> 17:14.269
And the vine said unto them, Should I eat my wine, which cheereth God the man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

17:14.654 --> 17:19.322
Then set all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou and rain over us.

17:19.983 --> 17:28.376
And the bramble said unto the trees, If there truth be in on me came over you, come and put your trust in my shadow.

17:28.997 --> 17:38.873
And if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the seers of that one.

17:38.994 --> 17:39.835
In the end,

17:40.220 --> 18:03.213
In the end, the job we killed after that, and shortly before that, or after that, at the end of Judges, after telling all these stories, I read one of them until my friend's name this evening, he started it, and then I read it.

18:03.474 --> 18:08.421
And it just said, well, this was before Israel had a king.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.246
and every man did what was right in his own eyes.

18:14.850 --> 18:15.751
Now I'm going to read me.

18:29.093 --> 18:35.303
I'm going to read a couple of stories, and the first one, not very long,

18:57.794 --> 18:59.637
I'm sorry.

19:00.018 --> 19:13.564
I thought I'd hold it down.

19:13.584 --> 19:19.014
I just saw a conversation at the end of the day.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.697
A lot of people are used to reading under this book.

19:40.910 --> 19:51.887
This story is called the Edward Story.

19:51.907 --> 19:57.976
Jack asked me, isn't it a terrible thing to grow up in a shadow in another person's sorrow?

19:59.658 --> 20:01.121
I suppose so, I answered.

20:01.141 --> 20:05.087
As you know, I grew up in the summer sunlight of upward mobility.

20:05.708 --> 20:08.672
This leeched out a lot to have brought ancestral grief.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.220
He went on with this one.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.444
It's not your fault that that's the case.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.889
Your bad disposition is not your fault, yet you're always angry.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.154
No way out, but continuous rage in a nut house.

20:23.257 --> 20:25.921
What if this sorrow is all due to history, I ask?

20:27.063 --> 20:34.373
The cool history of Europe, he said, in this way to show of ironic respect to one of my own things.

20:34.792 --> 20:43.264
Jack, the whole world ought to be opposed to Europe for its cruel history and yet in favor of it because after about a thousand years it made once no sense.

20:44.626 --> 20:46.188
Nonsense, he said objectively.

20:46.788 --> 20:54.018
A thousand years of outgoing, persistent, material cruelty tends to make enemies before you have to deal with these enemies is good sense.

20:54.038 --> 20:54.619
What then?

20:55.961 --> 20:56.442
I'm here.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.165
No one knows the power of good sense.

20:59.186 --> 21:02.470
They haven't been built up or experimented insufficiently.

21:03.783 --> 21:06.045
Well, I'm trying to tell you something, he said.

21:06.125 --> 21:09.448
Listen, one day I woke up and my father was asleep in the crib.

21:11.790 --> 21:12.731
I wonder why, I said.

21:13.912 --> 21:17.395
My mother made him sleep in the crib.

21:17.415 --> 21:17.676
All the time?

21:18.817 --> 21:20.738
That time anyway, that time I saw him.

21:20.758 --> 21:23.321
I wonder why, I said.

21:24.402 --> 21:27.985
Because she didn't want him to cover, he said.

21:28.005 --> 21:29.226
No, I don't believe that.

21:29.326 --> 21:31.228
Who told you that?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.790
I know it, he pointed his finger at him.

21:34.276 --> 21:36.559
I don't believe it, I say.

21:36.579 --> 21:40.544
Unless you have five babies all in a row, they have to get up at 6 a.m.

21:40.564 --> 21:42.586
when they both hate each other.

21:42.606 --> 21:45.770
Most people like their cousins who do that.

21:45.790 --> 21:45.990
Ball shit.

21:46.511 --> 21:48.273
She was trying to make them feel filthy.

21:48.293 --> 21:49.234
Where were these balls?

21:50.896 --> 21:52.878
I will never respond to that question.

21:53.719 --> 21:59.286
Ask them in a worried way again and again if they become responsible for the destruction of the entire world.

22:00.087 --> 22:04.232
I gave them two minutes of silence.

22:05.022 --> 22:08.345
He said, misery, misery, misery, grayness.

22:08.665 --> 22:09.886
I see it all very gray.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.348
My mother reproaches the grave.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.670
Small, he says, get up.

22:14.810 --> 22:17.233
Run down to the corner and get me here for pound of potty's.

22:17.593 --> 22:20.275
Then run over to the drugstore and get a two-pound copy of the world.

22:21.076 --> 22:27.982
He answered, my father, scrunched like an old gray fetus, looks up and smiles, smiles, smiles at the bit.

22:30.624 --> 22:32.586
How did you know what was going on, he asked.

22:32.606 --> 22:34.067
You were five years old.

22:35.431 --> 22:36.993
Why do you think what's going on?

22:37.393 --> 22:38.034
I'll tell you.

22:38.054 --> 22:38.955
It's not so hard.

22:39.115 --> 22:42.079
Any dope who's had a normal life could tell you.

22:42.099 --> 22:48.407
Anyone whose head hasn't been fermented, they've come close for 10 years of gluttonous analysis.

22:48.427 --> 22:50.970
Any of them could tell you.

22:50.990 --> 22:52.091
Tell me why, please.

22:52.812 --> 23:05.067
The reason your father was sleeping in the crib was that you and your sister, who usually slept in the crib, had a scarlet fever, and needed a decent bed to warm up and sweat come to a fever, crisis, and either get well or die.

23:05.907 --> 23:07.589
Who told you that?

23:07.749 --> 23:09.691
He lamented me as though I was an enemy.

23:10.492 --> 23:12.935
You fucking enemy, he said.

23:13.075 --> 23:15.078
You always see things in a rosy light.

23:15.098 --> 23:18.561
You have a rotten, rosy temperament.

23:20.344 --> 23:21.985
You were like that in sixth grade.

23:22.206 --> 23:24.648
One day you brought three American slaves to school.

23:26.350 --> 23:27.111
That was true.

23:27.131 --> 23:31.276
I made an announcement to the sixth grade assembly 30 years ago.

23:31.416 --> 23:32.117
I said.

23:32.992 --> 23:35.496
I thank God every day that I'm out in Europe.

23:36.057 --> 23:48.857
I thank God I'm American-born and live on East 172nd Street, where there's a grocery store, a candy store, and a drug store on one corner, and on the same block, a shelf, and two doctors' offices.

23:49.411 --> 23:53.636
One hundred and seventy seconds of you is a pile of shit, he said.

23:53.656 --> 23:55.819
Every word is in my welfare except for you.

23:55.839 --> 23:57.261
Thirty people have TV.

23:57.541 --> 24:00.906
Citizens and non-citizens are like starving, including war.

24:01.446 --> 24:09.176
Thank God capitalism led a war, it could pull out of your own feet there every now and then, and we'd all be dead.

24:11.319 --> 24:15.284
I'm glad you're not totally brainwashed by stocks, bonds, and cash.

24:15.304 --> 24:18.608
I'm glad that you still mention capitalism from time to time.

24:19.381 --> 24:34.532
Because of poverty, brilliance, and the early appearance of lots of soft hair on face and crotch, my friend Jack was a noticeable Marxist and Freudian by the morning of his tough birthday.

24:34.552 --> 24:37.238
In fact, his mind thickened with ideas.

24:37.218 --> 24:39.521
I continued to put out more flags.

24:40.243 --> 24:43.387
There were 28 flags that fluttered in different rooms and windows.

24:43.407 --> 24:45.891
I had one tattooed onto my arm.

24:46.512 --> 24:49.657
They had gotten together, but it looked like water because of the middle age.

24:51.039 --> 24:58.590
I'm probably more radical than you are nowadays, I say, anyways, since I was not quite that of my professional children and carmen.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.875
I therefore did not have to go into business for myself.

25:01.855 --> 25:03.497
You damn fool.

25:03.998 --> 25:05.480
Plenty of 1000s to say.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.384
I can bring in gods, engineers, teachers, both of them.

25:09.605 --> 25:13.651
Well, I believe I see the world as clearly as you do, I said.

25:14.091 --> 25:18.457
Rosiness is not a worse figure of him than the unique gray of the view of the world.

25:19.598 --> 25:20.059
Oh, yes.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.541
Yes, yes, yes, yes, he said.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.102
Do you know him?

25:22.743 --> 25:23.343
Just listen.

25:25.586 --> 25:29.972
My mother and father came from a small town in Poland that had three sons.

25:30.087 --> 25:40.162
My father decided to go to America to one stay out of the army, two stay out of jail, three, save his children from everyday war and ordinary programs.

25:41.244 --> 25:47.473
He was helped by the savings of parents, uncles, grandmothers, and settled by hundreds of thousands of others in that year.

25:48.434 --> 25:51.539
In America, New York City, he lived a hard and hopeful life.

25:52.621 --> 25:54.664
Sometimes he walked on Delancey Street.

25:55.184 --> 25:58.930
Sometimes, like a bachelor, he went to the theater on 2nd Avenue.

25:59.078 --> 26:03.623
Mostly he put his money away for the day he could bring his wife and sons to this place.

26:04.504 --> 26:07.086
Meanwhile, he told that famine struck.

26:07.827 --> 26:19.058
Not hunger, which all Americans suffered six, seven times a day, but famine, which tells the body to consume himself, first the fat, then the meat, the muscle, and the blood.

26:19.999 --> 26:23.483
Famining up the bodies of the little boys pretty quickly,

26:23.665 --> 26:25.767
My father meant my mother was old.

26:25.787 --> 26:27.408
He looked at her hands.

26:27.809 --> 26:31.332
There was no baby in her arms, no children dragging out her skirt.

26:31.912 --> 26:35.055
She was not wearing her hair for too long, with black braids.

26:35.555 --> 26:37.437
There was a cartwheel over her door with.

26:38.137 --> 26:41.000
She had shaved her head and on the back were Orthodox brides.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.844
They had been serious, advanced socialists like most of the youth of their town.

26:46.565 --> 26:48.486
He took her by the hands and brought her home.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.930
They never went anywhere alone, except to work with the orthodoxies.

26:53.568 --> 26:57.614
They held each other's hands when they sat down at the table, even at breakfast.

26:58.335 --> 27:01.600
Sometimes he patted her hand, sometimes she patted his.

27:02.161 --> 27:03.864
He read the paper to her every night.

27:05.066 --> 27:06.788
They're sitting at the edge of their chairs.

27:06.828 --> 27:10.494
He's leaning forward, reading on that old gull of life.

27:11.476 --> 27:13.058
Sometimes he smiles just a little.

27:13.899 --> 27:18.446
Then he puts the paper down and takes both her hands in his, as though they knew warm.

27:19.488 --> 27:20.790
He continues to read.

27:21.631 --> 27:23.355
just beyond the table on their heads.

27:23.415 --> 27:35.826
There is darkness in the kitchen, the bedroom, the dining room, the shadow of darkness, where, as a child, I lived my supper, did my homework, and went to bed.

27:49.120 --> 27:56.495
I'm going to do this one, but I'd like to be a very, very slow one.

28:00.343 --> 28:02.447
And then another one.

28:02.527 --> 28:03.990
This one's called Mudder.

28:06.687 --> 28:09.332
One day, I was listening to the AM radio.

28:09.712 --> 28:10.474
I heard a song.

28:10.915 --> 28:13.299
Oh, I long to see my mother in the doorway.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.284
By God, I said, I understand that song.

28:16.985 --> 28:19.029
I also long to see my mother in the doorway.

28:19.971 --> 28:24.038
As a matter of fact, she did stand frequently in various doorways looking at me.

28:24.254 --> 28:28.559
She stood one day, just so, at the front door, the darkness of the hallway behind her.

28:29.060 --> 28:29.941
It was reader's day.

28:30.501 --> 28:34.105
She said sadly, if you come home at 4 a.m.

28:34.165 --> 28:41.454
when you're 17, what time do you come home when you're 20?

28:41.474 --> 28:42.195
She asked this question that I knew.

28:42.215 --> 28:44.557
She had begun her worried preparations for death.

28:45.118 --> 28:48.642
She would not be present, she knew, when I was talking, so she wondered.

28:49.955 --> 28:52.257
Another time, she stood in the doorway of my room.

28:53.038 --> 28:57.623
I had just issued a political manifesto attacking the family's position on the Soviet Union.

28:58.644 --> 29:02.768
She said, go to sleep, for God's sake, you damn fool, you and your conscience like you.

29:03.469 --> 29:05.811
We saw it already, pop that thing.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.193
In 1905, we guessed it all.

29:09.014 --> 29:13.038
At the door of the kitchen, she said, you never finish your lunch, you run around sensible sleep.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.641
Don't move to common you.

29:15.781 --> 29:16.502
And she died.

29:17.512 --> 29:34.626
Naturally, for the rest of my life, I would love to see her, not only in doorways, in a great number of places, in the dining room with my hands, at the window looking up and down the block, in the country garden among Villiers and Navigold, in the living room with my father.

29:35.365 --> 29:37.388
They sat in comfortable leather chairs.

29:38.128 --> 29:39.370
They were listening to Mozart.

29:40.211 --> 29:42.134
They looked at one another, amazed.

29:42.975 --> 29:45.117
It seemed to them they had just come over on a boat.

29:45.898 --> 29:47.861
They had just learned the first thing which works.

29:48.722 --> 29:54.930
It seemed to them he had just proudly handed in a 100% correct exam to the American anatomy professor.

29:55.851 --> 29:59.095
It seemed as though she had just quit the shop for the kitchen.

29:59.868 --> 30:02.412
I wish I could see her in the doorway of the living room.

30:03.393 --> 30:05.176
She stood there for a moment.

30:05.196 --> 30:06.358
Then she sat beside him.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.962
They owned an expensive record player.

30:09.723 --> 30:10.805
They were listening to Bob.

30:11.566 --> 30:13.850
She said to him, Talk to me a bit.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.953
We don't talk so much anymore.

30:16.051 --> 30:19.076
And Tyree said, can't you see?

30:19.096 --> 30:22.422
I saw maybe 30 people who were there.

30:22.602 --> 30:24.645
Both sick, both poor, poor, poor, poor.

30:24.665 --> 30:25.367
Listen to the music, he said.

30:26.048 --> 30:28.492
I believe he once had perfect pitch.

30:28.512 --> 30:29.554
And Tyree, he said.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.056
And she died.

30:53.665 --> 30:57.289
This story is called The Story Era.

30:57.850 --> 31:01.815
Anyway, it's The Story Room.

31:05.059 --> 31:18.455
I was going to write a whole bunch of stories, one called The Story Era, another story listening, you know, telling, things like that, but I don't know if it's got to.

31:18.475 --> 31:18.795
The Story Era.

31:20.446 --> 31:24.913
I'm trying to curb my cultivated individualism, which seemed for years so sweet.

31:25.634 --> 31:30.521
It was my own song in my own world, and of course it may not be useful in the hard time to come.

31:31.383 --> 31:36.450
So when Jack said at dinner, what's doing today with your dear love?

31:36.470 --> 31:43.921
I decided to make an immediate public accounting of the day, not to water my brains with time spent in what it grows smart prior to the course.

31:45.163 --> 31:46.926
I said, you will begin at the beginning,

31:47.142 --> 31:49.945
Yes, he said, I've always loved the games.

31:49.965 --> 31:51.047
Men do what they want.

31:51.808 --> 31:54.891
No one knows if they will ever get over this.

31:54.911 --> 31:59.417
Hundreds of thousands of words have been written, some free rents and some commissions.

31:59.437 --> 32:00.098
No one knows.

32:00.759 --> 32:05.284
But here he said, I like mills too.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.045
Oh yes, I know.

32:06.406 --> 32:07.907
I questioned him.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.732
Is this due to age or the recent proliferation of newspaper articles?

32:12.337 --> 32:14.439
I don't know, he said.

32:14.459 --> 32:19.284
I wasn't wondering, but it seems to me that my father was a decent man with a typical non-confident.

32:19.304 --> 32:27.571
It seems to me he had settled into a great appreciation in the middle, just about the time my mother said, well, really, to not goodbye.

32:28.412 --> 32:33.056
Keep the children warm and let him, me, finish high school at least.

32:34.017 --> 32:36.139
Then she kissed him, kissed us kids.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.041
She said, I'll call you next week.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.463
But he never did speak to any of us again.

32:41.124 --> 32:42.225
What did she mean?

32:43.218 --> 32:47.145
Now, I've heard that story maybe 30 times and I still can't bear it.

32:47.886 --> 32:54.818
In fact, whenever I make a strong adversarial point in public, Jack tells it to grieve me.

32:54.838 --> 32:56.000
Sometimes I begin to cry.

32:56.040 --> 33:01.690
Sometimes I just make soup for me to read it.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.213
Once I thought, I'll find his underwear.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.956
I've heard that being done.

33:05.257 --> 33:06.739
But I couldn't find the cord.

33:07.801 --> 33:17.057
I haven't needed to iron in years because of famous American science, which gives us washing the mirror in one test tube and the earth gas in the other.

33:17.618 --> 33:19.000
It's right here.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.185
And the right test tube doesn't know what it's left test tube is doing.

33:22.205 --> 33:24.509
And yes, it does look, Jack.

33:24.549 --> 33:27.694
Therefore, I want to go on with the story, or perhaps begin it again.

33:28.756 --> 33:29.357
Jack said,

33:29.708 --> 33:31.491
What did you do today, my dear Lord?

33:32.333 --> 33:32.814
I said.

33:33.355 --> 33:37.764
My dear, in the late morning, I left our apartment.

33:37.784 --> 33:40.308
The Times was folded on the doormen of 1A.

33:40.328 --> 33:44.657
I could see that it was black, the earthquake, war, and project murder.

33:45.418 --> 33:52.071
Clearly death had been successful everywhere, but none I saw when I stepped out the front door about an hour on the block.

33:52.051 --> 34:10.323
Here is the springtime, partly because of the time of year, and partly because we have a self-involved, block-centric street association, which has lined us with sycamores and enhanced us with a mountain edge, two depots, and here and there because we are part of the whole, Idle Ample, City, St.

34:10.343 --> 34:10.463
Louis.

34:12.306 --> 34:14.170
I said to myself, what a day.

34:14.190 --> 34:17.856
I think I'll run down to the school and pick up some comestibles.

34:18.072 --> 34:20.694
But I actually thought that.

34:20.995 --> 34:29.903
Had I simply gone to the store without thinking, the word commestible would never have occurred.

34:30.123 --> 34:36.609
I would never imagine hungry, supper, nighttime, jack, greens, cheese, store, walk, street.

34:36.629 --> 34:41.713
But I don't like this language, wheat and chan, with its widening pool of foreign genes.

34:42.374 --> 34:48.079
And since I never have had any occasion to say commestible, it was pleasurable to think.

34:48.869 --> 34:56.513
At the grocery store, I met an old friend who had continued his life as it had begun in the Alhambra, but not selfishly.

34:57.617 --> 35:02.693
He had also ordered me like the real estate administration and had never spoken to the people.

35:03.078 --> 35:16.500
Most artists do because they have very small audiences and are angry at those audiences for not enlarging themselves.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.143
How do they do that?

35:18.243 --> 35:19.365
I often ask him,

35:19.852 --> 35:21.976
They have words of mouth, don't they?

35:21.996 --> 35:25.542
Most artists previously will reply.

35:25.562 --> 35:28.607
Well, first my friend and I talked about the lettuce boycott.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.809
It was a really old boycott.

35:30.691 --> 35:39.025
I told my friend, his name was Jim, all about the silk stocking boycott, which coincided with the Japanese devastation of Manchuria.

35:39.005 --> 35:52.609
And the disappearance of the 6th Avenue L of the Japanese factory purposes had been returned a few years later, sometimes to the very same neighborhood, as shrapnel stuck in the bodies of some younger workers of my generation.

35:53.534 --> 35:55.376
Did that be the pro-marker?

35:55.437 --> 35:56.558
Yes, respectfully.

35:57.459 --> 36:03.748
They were aware that I had witnessing information of events that had occurred when he was in grade school.

36:03.768 --> 36:07.172
That respect gave me all the advantage I needed to be aggressive and critical.

36:08.314 --> 36:17.346
I said, Jim, I've been wanting for years to tell you that I did not believe in the effectiveness of the way you had to get me screaming at those demonstrations.

36:18.027 --> 36:21.752
I don't think the meaningless struggle has anything to do at all at a bracket.

36:21.732 --> 36:25.778
You don't understand our soul, he said.

36:25.798 --> 36:28.282
I believe the field is the handmaid of his evolution.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.005
Did thou lay with me?

36:31.047 --> 36:33.631
He referred to my correction by nodding his head.

36:34.252 --> 36:40.602
He accepts criticism and grace words, as he can always meet with a smiling bumper of higher opinion.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.814
Do you want to know more about our Tobey's name?

36:44.834 --> 36:48.279
No, well, I shouldn't, but I've been awful busy.

36:48.299 --> 36:51.264
Also, I may have once known a great deal about him.

36:52.106 --> 36:56.433
In the last few years, all the characters of literature run together in my life.

36:56.994 --> 37:00.199
Sometimes King Louisville occurs right next to Mrs. Fawcett.

37:02.162 --> 37:05.728
At this point, the butcher said, what do you have, young lady?

37:06.434 --> 37:11.341
I refused to tell him.

37:11.361 --> 37:15.687
Jack, to whom made you remember, I was telling the day long story Monday.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.570
Oh, God, no.

37:17.790 --> 37:18.992
You didn't do that again.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.295
I dare say it.

37:21.315 --> 37:22.096
It's an insult.

37:22.116 --> 37:26.362
You cannot say to a woman of my age who looks my age like you have your baby.

37:26.703 --> 37:27.764
I should not answer him.

37:28.125 --> 37:34.153
If you say that to someone like me, it really means, what do you want to do?

37:34.174 --> 37:34.534
It better go past.

37:34.514 --> 37:39.799
Are you getting like that now, two years?

37:39.819 --> 37:41.240
Look, Jack, face facts.

37:41.921 --> 37:43.422
I say the butcher meant well.

37:44.063 --> 37:45.244
He meant no harm.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.785
Eddie, he's not so bad.

37:47.265 --> 37:51.669
He spends two hours coming to New York, Jersey, then he spends two hours going back.

37:52.250 --> 37:55.213
I'm sorry for this long journey, but I screw in.

37:55.473 --> 37:56.894
He mustn't say anymore.

37:57.995 --> 38:00.938
Eddie, I said, don't talk like that.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.479
I won't tell you where I want.

38:02.746 --> 38:05.310
Whatever you say, Mommy, what do you have?

38:06.312 --> 38:08.616
Well, could you cut me up a couple of fryers?

38:09.036 --> 38:10.138
Sure, I wrote, he said.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.682
I'll have a pork butt, said Jim.

38:13.624 --> 38:19.834
By the way, you know, we're doing a show at City College this summer, not in the auditorium, in the biology lab.

38:20.335 --> 38:21.557
There's no idea we can.

38:22.178 --> 38:26.425
We had a fight trip, the most political thing we've done since scavenging.

38:26.405 --> 38:32.173
Did I hear him say City College that day as he cut the little chicken's leg out of his side?

38:33.154 --> 38:39.743
Well, when I was a boy, a kid, what we called City College, you know, it was CCNY then.

38:39.823 --> 38:47.333
Well, we called it Suburbs by Citizens of New York.

38:47.870 --> 38:52.076
Really, said Jim.

38:52.096 --> 38:52.998
He looked at me.

38:53.118 --> 38:53.599
Did I object?

38:53.859 --> 38:54.861
Was I offended?

38:56.022 --> 38:58.566
If I didn't know that the decision doesn't insult me, I said.

38:59.127 --> 39:04.095
However, I understand that the clipping of criticism of young girls continues in Morocco to this day.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.199
Jim has a shy side.

39:07.219 --> 39:12.207
He took his fourth flight and said goodbye.

39:12.187 --> 39:14.591
I had begun to examine the chicken lilies.

39:14.651 --> 39:18.476
Sometimes they're tannered and red, but I understand it's not too bad.

39:19.358 --> 39:22.823
Suddenly treadmill, Thomas appeared at my side and embraced me.

39:23.524 --> 39:28.431
He's a famous fussy gourmet, and I was glad the butcher saw her affection and hugged.

39:29.733 --> 39:32.237
Thought any good euphemisms lately, I asked?

39:32.386 --> 39:33.748
Ah-ha, he said.

39:34.248 --> 39:39.275
He still feels bad about his life in the language division that put the best upon him.

39:39.295 --> 39:49.889
A year or two ago, Jack interviewed in a magazine called The Social Work Viewer, which ran prior to the issues before the first editor was hired by The Times.

39:50.610 --> 39:51.972
That's still a fine periodical.

39:53.193 --> 39:54.495
Great part of the exhibit.

39:55.437 --> 39:59.242
Mr. Thomas, what is the purpose of the language tradition?

39:59.262 --> 40:05.229
Well, Jack, it was organized to discontinue the English language as a useful way to communicate exact facts.

40:05.249 --> 40:12.437
Of course, it was not the first or left organization to have attempted this, but it has had some success.

40:12.497 --> 40:21.428
Mr. Thomas, is this an ironic statement made in the afterglow of the new on realism and a broad range of classified information that is made of your own thoughts?

40:21.408 --> 40:22.991
Not at all, Jack.

40:23.011 --> 40:26.236
It wasn't I who invented the expression Protective Reaction.

40:26.857 --> 40:41.340
And with Eisenhower and that I had fought up while thousands of hydrogen bombs were being tucked into silos, it was not I who invented Atoms for Peace and its code name, Operation Weegees.

40:41.681 --> 40:46.268
Could you give us at least one expression you invented to self-define or mitigate?

40:46.400 --> 40:50.125
Jack, I screamed, salt upon, mitigate, and quit the disease.

40:50.686 --> 40:53.069
Shut up, said Jack, and he turned to the interview.

40:53.871 --> 40:54.712
Well, he asked.

40:55.633 --> 40:56.895
But I don't said show well, Thomas.

40:57.095 --> 41:09.893
I was asked to develop a word, a series of words, that can describe, denote any of the Latin American countries in a condition of change, something that will by its mere remnants neutralize or mock your evolutionary situation.

41:09.873 --> 41:17.031
After consultation, brain-picking, and a daydream-appropriate ENIAC creation, I came up with Rebo State.

41:17.315 --> 41:20.500
The word was split into conversations in Washington.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.483
One or two journalists were glad to use it.

41:22.884 --> 41:24.647
It was just lingo for a long time.

41:25.147 --> 41:30.456
But you have no doubt seen the monograph, The Rebel Stationary Peasant in Brazil today.

41:30.516 --> 41:42.495
Even you pinkos use it, not to mention Wasserman's political article, Rainforest, Still Water, and the Culture of the Middle State, which was actually featured in your journal.

41:43.420 --> 41:54.858
Right on Treadwell, as our black brothers jointly said for a couple of years before handing back onions on for our saltification on mitigation.

41:54.878 --> 41:55.859
Still, it's true.

41:55.879 --> 41:59.785
Thomas could have gone as far as far happens to be in our time and generation.

42:00.186 --> 42:07.237
Hundreds of ambitious, jobless college students have put in his tongue on Senior Defense Department and Recruiting Day.

42:07.477 --> 42:11.183
But apart from cooking a lot of fish, he has chosen to go fall, quite often.

42:11.315 --> 42:19.964
Some people around here think that the form, the energetic cleansing, the nasal passage, is the basic wisdom of ether.

42:19.984 --> 42:21.486
Other people think that's not so.

42:22.687 --> 42:27.612
But it reminded me as we waited, how's Gutsy?

42:28.733 --> 42:29.134
Gus?

42:30.115 --> 42:32.417
Oh yeah, she's in the hydroponics.

42:32.457 --> 42:34.700
She's got all this fudge standing around with us.

42:35.100 --> 42:38.364
We may never have to go shopping again.

42:38.424 --> 42:39.685
Well, why'd you laugh, don't we?

42:40.053 --> 42:43.637
I repeated this story to several others before the day was over.

42:44.919 --> 42:46.360
I mocked Gussie to Jack.

42:47.161 --> 42:53.208
I spoke of her mockingly to one or two strangers, and the fact that she was away away in the future.

42:54.290 --> 42:55.491
I was ignorant.

42:55.511 --> 42:57.774
It wasn't my ocean she was away in.

42:57.814 --> 43:03.360
In fact, I am stuck here among my own vessels and pies.

43:03.458 --> 43:07.324
Don't you wish you could rise powerfully above your time and name?

43:08.145 --> 43:20.483
I'm sure we all try, but here we are, always slipping and falling down into them, speaking their narrow language of the subject, which is how to save the world and pick the business.

43:21.745 --> 43:25.230
Or if I tread well, I said sadly, I'm glad they have some dreams.

43:26.965 --> 43:29.750
The owner of our grocery was holding down the vegetables.

43:30.271 --> 43:32.294
He made the lettuce look fresher than it was.

43:33.015 --> 43:39.506
Little drops of water spilled on the broccoli beads among the heads among the green beady buds and were just the same size.

43:40.588 --> 43:41.289
Orlando.

43:41.970 --> 43:44.435
Jack was walking the door last week at 2 a.m.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.777
and I was out at 7 a.m.

43:45.797 --> 43:47.640
and you were here both times.

43:47.806 --> 43:49.229
That's true, he said, I was.

43:50.090 --> 43:52.094
Orlando, how can you do that?

43:52.214 --> 43:53.216
How can you get to work?

43:53.276 --> 43:54.017
How can you live?

43:54.077 --> 43:55.680
How can you see your kids and your wife?

43:56.482 --> 43:58.465
Can't, he said, maybe once a week.

43:59.147 --> 44:00.008
Are you all right?

44:00.810 --> 44:01.110
Yes.

44:01.851 --> 44:04.256
He put down his hose and put my hand in his.

44:04.977 --> 44:07.161
You see, he said, this is wonderful work.

44:07.482 --> 44:08.463
This is crude.

44:08.944 --> 44:11.569
I love all work that has to be the crude.

44:11.549 --> 44:12.471
I'm lucky.

44:13.072 --> 44:15.416
He dropped my hand and patted a baked cabbage.

44:15.977 --> 44:16.517
Look at me.

44:16.698 --> 44:17.900
I'm a small businessman.

44:18.260 --> 44:25.192
I got an A&P on one side, a Bo-Pak on another, and a fancy international for a cheese and herring down the block.

44:25.933 --> 44:27.997
If I don't quit it 16 hours a day, I'm dead.

44:28.498 --> 44:35.329
But Mrs. A, just look at that grass, the beans, that corner with all the parsley and the olive oil and the dill.

44:35.349 --> 44:36.932
It's beautiful, right?

44:37.098 --> 44:39.583
Oh yeah, I guess, I guess it is.

44:40.024 --> 44:44.875
What I really love are the little bunches of WordPress, the way you mind the character.

44:46.197 --> 44:49.966
Yeah, this is a, you're okay, you got the idea, the beauty, he says.

44:50.527 --> 44:54.415
I went both to take three and various strawberries out of the perfect box.

44:55.154 --> 45:07.475
A couple of years later, in the present, which I cannot quite mention, but will be fought over Chilean plums be part of it.

45:07.495 --> 45:13.205
I was forced to shop in the reasonable supermarket among disinterested people with no credit asked and non-office.

45:13.706 --> 45:15.850
But at that particular moment, we were at peace.

45:15.950 --> 45:20.217
That is, I owed him $275 and he allowed it.

45:21.682 --> 45:22.964
Okay, said Jack.

45:23.344 --> 45:27.330
If you and Orlando are such power, if one owned movie store is right.

45:28.292 --> 45:31.456
He picked up a rabbit green and moved one.

45:31.476 --> 45:33.680
I invented an anthropological reply.

45:34.321 --> 45:38.046
Well, Orlando's father is an old man.

45:38.066 --> 45:44.656
One of the jobs Orlando's culture has provided for his father's old age is the drawing of strawberries into pint and cord boxes.

45:45.076 --> 45:49.022
Just to be fair, he has to hide one or two greenish ones in each box.

45:49.576 --> 45:51.319
I think I'm going to beg, said Jack.

45:52.562 --> 46:04.125
But I was only extrapolating from his article in the third issue of the Social Appear, who's merchandising, or who intended to be a consumer, are reminding him of this, he said.

46:05.270 --> 46:16.106
So he slept, his arms around me as sweetly as after the long day he probably slept beside his former wife and might as well beside mine instead of me.

46:16.126 --> 46:27.784
I was so comfortable, our good mattress and our nice feelings were such a cozy combination that I remembered a song my friend Ruthie had made up ten years earlier to tease the time, the place, us.

46:28.878 --> 46:32.061
Oh, the marriage bed, the marriage bed.

46:32.761 --> 46:34.103
Can you think of anything nicer?

46:34.943 --> 46:38.807
For days and nights of years and years, you lie beside your darling.

46:39.568 --> 46:41.189
Your arms are hugging, my mother.

46:41.629 --> 46:43.091
Your legs are torn together.

46:43.851 --> 46:49.877
Until the dark and certain day, your lover comes to take you away, away, away.

46:49.897 --> 46:56.843
At about 5 a.m., Jack cried out in terror.

46:57.143 --> 46:58.785
That's okay, Kibber stated.

46:58.825 --> 46:59.785
You're not the only one.

46:59.886 --> 47:00.887
Everybody's mortal.

47:02.348 --> 47:05.311
I weaved all my softening strength against his skated back.

47:05.971 --> 47:10.255
Then I dreamed the following in a kind of diorama that you tell the abstraction.

47:11.056 --> 47:16.181
That the children had grown all the way up, one had moved to another neighborhood, the other to a distant country.

47:17.002 --> 47:25.750
That one was never to be seen again, the dream explained, because he had blown up a very bad bank, and in the dream, I was the one who told him to do it.

47:26.371 --> 47:27.732
The dream continued.

47:28.013 --> 47:31.456
No, it circled itself, widened into my very old age.

47:31.476 --> 47:38.843
Then his disappearance made one of those typical spiraling descents influenced by film textbooks.

47:38.863 --> 47:42.626
Unleashable at the bottom, their childhood played more and made jokes.

47:43.887 --> 47:44.288
I woke.

47:45.189 --> 47:46.770
Let's go after the water, I think.

47:46.790 --> 47:48.091
I want to touch something, Jack.

47:49.332 --> 47:52.255
Run, run, run, run, he saw my wide awake on his sweat.

47:53.016 --> 47:55.298
Jack, I want to have a baby.

47:55.852 --> 47:57.054
Ha, ha, he said.

47:57.114 --> 47:58.195
You can.

47:58.856 --> 47:59.457
Too late.

47:59.477 --> 48:02.801
A couple of years too late, he said, and fell asleep.

48:02.821 --> 48:03.482
Then he spoke.

48:04.002 --> 48:05.404
He started proposing work.

48:05.544 --> 48:06.726
I mean, proposing miracle.

48:07.226 --> 48:13.134
A kid might be very smart, get a scholarship at MIT, and get caught up in problem solving.

48:13.154 --> 48:16.738
I don't mind if a kid could invent something worse than anything else I would ever imagine.

48:17.379 --> 48:19.682
Then he fell asleep and snorted.

48:20.017 --> 48:24.690
I pulled the Old Testament out from under the bed where I keep most of my bedtime literature.

48:25.392 --> 48:34.718
I jammed an extra pillow under my neck and sat it off almost straight in order to read the story of Abraham and Sarah with interlinear intelligence.

48:35.002 --> 48:37.267
There was a lot more Jack's day.

48:37.388 --> 48:43.762
He often makes it sensible of what we're all going to want, because you don't have that little story on these clowns.

48:44.283 --> 48:52.723
Because to me, Monty is the horseman of perpetual Boston and war, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

48:53.429 --> 48:56.514
Just the same, I said the softly snoring to Jack.

48:57.175 --> 49:03.646
Before all that popular badness waged its way into the world, it was first a little baby, Isaac.

49:04.327 --> 49:06.351
Remember what I mean for Miss Sarah?

49:06.631 --> 49:11.299
Like all our old boys, remember the way they practiced their Bible sentences?

49:12.261 --> 49:19.032
Oh Jack, that Isaac, Sarah's boy, before he was old enough to be taken out by his father to get a throat cut,

49:19.349 --> 49:23.854
He must have just laid around smiling and making up diphthongs and listening.

49:25.075 --> 49:29.099
And the women sang so long to him and wrapped him up in such pretty rugs, right?

49:30.400 --> 49:38.949
In his sleep, which is as contentious as his waking, he said, yes, but he should not have been allowed to throw all that sand at his brother.

49:39.970 --> 49:40.530
You're right.

49:41.211 --> 49:42.272
Jack, you're right.

49:42.772 --> 49:44.835
I'm waiting for you, I said.

49:44.975 --> 49:47.297
However, all you have to do is be with me.
