WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:08.455
Okay, we're talking with, could you give me a full name, Mr. Kegel, and initial, whatever?

00:08.696 --> 00:12.341
William, middle initial is R. Kegel, C-A-G-L-E.

00:12.742 --> 00:13.804
And your title is?

00:14.925 --> 00:15.687
Lily Librarian.

00:15.887 --> 00:19.713
Lily Librarian at Indiana University in Wilmington, Indiana.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.197
And it's right, 6 October, 90.

00:22.217 --> 00:30.730
And I was just telling Mr. Kegel that Dave Karpolis has in Santa Barbara, California, has the...

00:31.199 --> 00:33.023
the Confederate States of America.

00:33.043 --> 00:36.329
And then you said?

00:36.590 --> 00:38.814
That we have the corrected proofs.

00:39.054 --> 00:41.339
Small world is a good place to start.

00:41.359 --> 00:43.082
Well, that's a good place to start.

00:44.786 --> 00:49.495
I guess the Lilly Library, would you say that the core collection

00:49.880 --> 00:56.311
began as a result of the beneficence of one collector, and did we take it from there?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.074
Actually, it starts a little earlier than that.

00:58.094 --> 01:15.364
It starts with the Special Collections Department in the university that was created in about 1940 with the acquisition of a major collection of Augustan period literature that is English literature of the period of late 1730, 18th century.

01:15.614 --> 01:31.611
And from that, we acquired a number of other special collections that came to the university before Mr. Lilly's gift, including the big Lincoln collection, the War of 1812 collection, and other collections on English and American literature and culture.

01:32.933 --> 01:42.583
Then in 1956, Mr. Lilly decided to give his collection of books to the university, and it was that major gift of great books.

01:42.985 --> 01:51.960
That really started the impetus to build a separate library and to develop into what we have become today, a large research library in the humanities.

01:52.641 --> 02:02.216
Mr. Lilly provided the high spots, and we've been filling in the material around them to turn what was really a collection of great books into a research library.

02:02.697 --> 02:06.343
Can it be said that he directed the course?

02:07.184 --> 02:21.279
Well, that's, yes, in a sense, but it's a most unusual sort of direction, because most collectors specialize in one particular field, and they focus as, let's say, William Andrews Clark in the Clark Library on two or three particular topics.

02:21.799 --> 02:24.522
The Clements Library at the University of Michigan, the same thing.

02:24.582 --> 02:29.267
There's an emphasis on American history up to a certain point.

02:29.307 --> 02:30.949
American antiquarian society, the same.

02:30.969 --> 02:32.390
The Folger, Shakespeare Library.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.052
Each of these libraries and collectors

02:34.471 --> 02:37.596
focused on one thing that they wanted to do and they built their collections around that.

02:37.897 --> 02:40.401
Mr. Lilly was interested in the great books in all fields.

02:41.262 --> 02:52.801
And if there was a list of 100 great books in science or in British literature or whatever it was, a grow your list of 100 important books in some subject, he wanted all of those books.

02:53.322 --> 03:01.575
So instead of focusing on a particular subject and building that subject in depth, he collected great books across the board, any subject, any field.

03:01.775 --> 03:07.680
So he brought to the library, or started us, with such a wide range of materials.

03:07.780 --> 03:18.629
It could be great 19th century Russian novels, it could be English literature, it could be American history, it could be voyages and exploration, it could be music, it could be any subject that you could name.

03:18.649 --> 03:27.957
So instead of focusing our attention on one particular subject, it gave us a mandate to fish in many waters, and we've been doing that ever since.

03:28.798 --> 03:31.140
Did he leave money as well as... No, he did not.

03:31.627 --> 04:00.756
It was a gift of books to the university, and the Lilly Endowment, which is the foundation that uses the excess capital of the Lilly Pharmaceutical Company, provided us with ongoing support from 1960 when the library was dedicated up until this year, 1989 actually, they provided annual contributions that were met by the university.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.263
so that we would have money with which to acquire books.

04:03.844 --> 04:25.195
Then in this year, actually October of 1989, the Lilly Endowment decided that instead of coming back to them each year for renewal, that they would give us a lump sum as an endowment, which they have now done, so that we have now an endowment that allows us to continue the purchase of books.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.861
Is this anything like the J.C.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.523
Brown Library in Providence, for instance,

04:31.060 --> 04:34.385
which is affiliated certainly with Brown University.

04:34.405 --> 04:39.452
It's part of the Brown family, but they don't get any money from the university.

04:39.472 --> 04:41.054
No, our situation is totally different.

04:41.074 --> 04:47.804
We are a branch library within the Indiana University library system, and I report directly to the dean of libraries.

04:48.364 --> 04:51.970
All of our people are members of the Indiana University library faculty.

04:53.291 --> 04:57.938
Our support staff, our physical facilities are all provided by the university.

04:58.679 --> 04:59.380
So our

05:00.052 --> 05:28.472
were just uh another library within the library system so if if there were a major acquisition that you wanted to make you'd have to run it through the state bureaucracy so to speak not at all no no acquisitions are entirely in my hands oh that's great so if i want to buy one book it costs one million dollars and i have one million dollars in the bank i can write you know to the book center and say send the book have you done that so not for a million dollars yeah i think uh we've come pretty close to that on some collections but but

05:28.840 --> 05:52.384
it's a matter it's a very simple philosophy it's the philosophy of adding strength to strength you acquire collections where you can if there's a research collection that's been put together and it's offered to the university and we can afford it it'll fit into our budget and we feel that it will be useful within the university in terms of the teaching and research mission of the university then we purchase the collection but once you purchase the collection like that

05:52.769 --> 05:56.993
then you have a commitment to continue developing that collection, to add new materials.

05:57.213 --> 06:02.178
So to add strength to the strength to make it a greater research collection, which is what we do.

06:03.179 --> 06:08.265
Everyone agrees that you are one of the great research libraries in the United States.

06:08.285 --> 06:14.171
This has happened virtually within, what, the last 30 years of starting, basically, I would say.

06:14.211 --> 06:17.774
We opened our doors in October of 1960, so yes, just 30 years.

06:18.415 --> 06:19.236
What happened?

06:19.316 --> 06:21.578
Was it concurrent with the Lilly gift?

06:21.828 --> 06:29.598
that this attitude developed here, we're going to make ourselves a really great research institution?

06:30.179 --> 06:33.824
Well, it goes back before that.

06:34.405 --> 06:42.255
There are histories of Indiana University you can read, but the dominant figure in all of this is Herman Wells.

06:42.716 --> 06:43.016
Herman?

06:43.376 --> 06:51.447
Herman Wells was the president of the university from, what was it, 1935 to 1960, I guess.

06:53.587 --> 07:05.026
And it was Dr. Wells who really had the vision of building a university that was not just the average state university, but making this a very special place.

07:05.847 --> 07:08.071
He brought in very good people.

07:08.692 --> 07:16.985
The music school developed during his time, the arts and the cultural aspects of the university.

07:17.726 --> 07:20.691
They built the auditorium that we have here.

07:20.992 --> 07:24.517
really developed a real interest in the arts and the humanities.

07:25.358 --> 07:28.482
Also in the sciences, of course, I work in the chemistry department here.

07:28.502 --> 07:29.804
It's very well known as well.

07:30.345 --> 07:43.482
But I suppose right now the things that we point to with the greatest pride are institutions like the Indiana University School of Music, which is one of the finest in the world, and the Lowry Library.

07:43.502 --> 07:45.906
You mentioned Dr. Wells' years, 35 to 60.

07:46.006 --> 07:47.768
It's interesting.

07:48.129 --> 07:50.712
Coincidental to that is about the same time

07:51.417 --> 07:59.230
in the late 50s, early 60s, when you had Harry Ransom down at the University of Texas going off in a... That's right.

07:59.250 --> 08:05.661
And the word you used is the word you run into all the time down in Texas, the vision, you know, the vision of Harry Ransom.

08:05.681 --> 08:10.610
Do you think that there was kind of a competition between schools like Texas and Indiana?

08:10.650 --> 08:12.954
Those would have been the two big ones, certainly.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.196
Well, not really.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.121
The...

08:17.287 --> 08:25.416
The University of Texas and the HRC had substantially more funding than the Lilly Library has ever had.

08:26.157 --> 08:33.725
At the height of Harry Ransom's activities, I think their acquisition budget for books or the money they were spending was something around $6 million a year.

08:35.107 --> 08:42.535
At the same time, the Lilly Library had a budget of $250,000 a year.

08:42.937 --> 08:43.898
since quadrupled.

08:44.218 --> 08:47.722
Warren Lovitch said the most he ever had was $2 million a year.

08:48.282 --> 08:50.625
Well, but that's probably from the Regents.

08:50.805 --> 08:55.790
That may be, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't find money to buy some other sources.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.191
At least this is why.

08:57.271 --> 09:00.034
I mean, don't quote me on the University of Texas.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.477
No, no.

09:02.837 --> 09:09.323
But anyway, the point is that they had substantially more funding than Dave Randall had, who was our first librarian here.

09:09.343 --> 09:10.885
$250,000, that was it?

09:11.067 --> 09:17.297
We had $125,000 from the Lilly Endowment and $125,000 matching from the university between the years 1960 and 1970.

09:17.337 --> 09:22.265
In 1970, they doubled it, each of them, so we were up to $500,000.

09:23.567 --> 09:33.683
Now with our endowment of $5 million and a built-in increase that came as a part of that agreement with the Lilly Endowment,

09:34.051 --> 09:51.075
Our funds, we have $300,000 from the university this year, and that will go up by $25,000 increments until we reach $500,000 in 1999, at which time, with our interest on the $5 million, we will have a budget of about $1 million.

09:51.095 --> 09:53.459
We spend $600,000 or $700,000 a year right now.

09:53.939 --> 09:55.842
So the acquisitions continue at pace.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.925
Acquisitions continue at pace.

09:57.945 --> 10:01.510
It's still a fairly small part of the Tobey University library budget.

10:02.080 --> 10:07.906
which is now over $4 million, and they're pushing hard to move it up another million.

10:08.747 --> 10:16.696
So we're still a smallish, specialized operation compared to a large university library.

10:16.716 --> 10:26.427
But within what we do, within our funds available, we've been trying to build some good collections to bring people here to work in the university.

10:26.507 --> 10:28.189
What would you say are they really

10:29.333 --> 10:32.797
first-rate collections that really do attract the scholars?

10:33.838 --> 10:39.203
The ones that are most frequently used are generally manuscript collections associated with particular individuals.

10:39.403 --> 10:46.331
The most heavily used collections in the library here, I would say, are the Upton Sinclair collection.

10:46.411 --> 10:47.992
All of his papers are here.

10:48.653 --> 10:50.415
Some five tons of manuscripts.

10:50.455 --> 10:57.842
Yeah, it came out in two big beacon band, moving bands, about four tons of printed material as well.

10:58.063 --> 10:58.463
Purchased.

10:59.202 --> 11:07.712
He wanted to give it to the Huntington Library, but Herbert Hoover said, I won't have the papers of that damned socialist in my library.

11:07.732 --> 11:08.152
Is that right?

11:08.312 --> 11:14.980
Dave Randall read that story in the newspaper, called up Mr. Sinclair, and rearranged to purchase the collection.

11:15.120 --> 11:22.809
Other collections, though, in addition to that, let's see, among the literary people, papers, we have a lot of Escher Pound manuscript material here.

11:23.530 --> 11:25.011
We have Sylvia Plath's papers.

11:25.332 --> 11:27.454
Those are heavily used.

11:28.902 --> 11:35.549
In the film area, Orson Welles' papers and John Ford's papers draw the scholars all the time.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.271
They're very heavily used collections.

11:37.411 --> 11:39.533
And these will all be purchased, right?

11:39.553 --> 11:40.334
Oh, yes.

11:40.374 --> 11:42.035
Collections of that sort tend to be purchased.

11:42.096 --> 11:44.738
We have a lot of collections that have come to us as gifts as well.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.841
Those tend to be more book collections.

11:48.162 --> 11:53.307
We have a vast collection of American sheet music, 103,000 pieces of American sheet music.

11:53.843 --> 11:58.288
roughly the end of the 18th century up through the 1960s.

11:58.308 --> 11:59.389
Now, where did you get that?

11:59.409 --> 12:00.290
It was given to us.

12:01.432 --> 12:05.536
It was a collection formed by a dentist in New York whose name was Saul Starr.

12:05.556 --> 12:10.102
It was purchased by Bernardo Mendel, who was a friend of the library here, and was given to the library.

12:10.322 --> 12:11.463
Starr with two eyes?

12:11.483 --> 12:11.723
Yeah.

12:13.846 --> 12:15.788
So we have a collector who collected sheet music.

12:15.848 --> 12:17.190
Collector who collected sheet music.

12:17.390 --> 12:23.597
And when he died, his collection came up for sale, and Mr. Mendel bought it and presented it to the library.

12:24.202 --> 12:35.140
But then in printed materials, the collections that get used, that fluctuates so much according to what certain academic modes there are.

12:36.743 --> 12:48.522
Historical research today tends to be less based on research with early printed materials, with vast holdings on subjects like the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the

12:48.873 --> 12:59.824
The British Civil War in the 1640s, over 5,000 printed pamphlets in the subject area, material of that sort that just doesn't see much use right now.

13:01.085 --> 13:01.426
I don't know.

13:01.446 --> 13:04.269
I suppose you should talk to Joel Silver, who's our head of public services.

13:04.309 --> 13:08.613
He could tell you more about what collections in the printed area are being used.

13:10.255 --> 13:10.655
It varies.

13:11.135 --> 13:15.640
A lot of the ... We have different categories of readers who come to a library like this.

13:16.733 --> 13:21.938
You know, I probably, among the most prominent, the visitors that come from abroad and from all around the country.

13:21.978 --> 13:29.526
Nigel Nicholson is here, for example, right now working on his edition of the selected letters of his mother, Vita Sackville West, and his father, Harold Nicholson.

13:30.027 --> 13:34.191
There's 10,000 letters that he has to go through, so he's here with us for a month doing that.

13:35.833 --> 13:41.358
Then we have our own faculty, and then we have student-related or assigned classwork that is done here in the library.

13:41.378 --> 13:44.321
So are undergraduates allowed to use them?

13:44.361 --> 13:45.863
Yes, anybody's allowed to use it.

13:46.417 --> 13:49.622
No restrictions on use.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.365
That's different from a lot of rare book libraries.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.870
The reason for that really is that we're not in a large metropolitan area.

13:55.431 --> 14:02.622
If we were the Huntington Library in Los Angeles and had that sort of a population base to draw on, you would have to restrict it, as they do.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.847
But the Huntington is not affiliated with the college or university.

14:05.887 --> 14:10.715
But the HIC is, and it's very tough to get into the HIC.

14:10.755 --> 14:12.137
They have restrictions.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.752
Well, they've just chosen to do that.

14:14.953 --> 14:21.441
We've chosen to go the opposite way and to encourage students to come in and use materials in the library.

14:21.901 --> 14:22.883
Primary materials.

14:23.443 --> 14:24.204
Primary materials.

14:24.324 --> 14:24.705
Why not?

14:24.885 --> 14:25.646
Isn't that nice?

14:25.666 --> 14:26.307
Sure.

14:26.727 --> 14:36.540
If you're going to learn about the American Revolution instead of just reading a textbook, plunge in and read contemporary newspapers and documents and pamphlets and experience it firsthand.

14:36.720 --> 14:41.466
Had Mr. Lilly left, in addition to the wonderful books,

14:42.222 --> 14:49.812
but let's say a considerable sort of like in Chicago, who basically directed the way that collection was going to be built.

14:50.493 --> 14:55.360
I think science books is what he said, and no dirty French novel.

14:55.380 --> 14:58.104
You know, that's actually in the world.

15:00.347 --> 15:04.112
I guess you think that the Lilly today would be a different kind of a research project?

15:04.885 --> 15:09.671
No, Mr. Lilly had a very clearly stated philosophy.

15:10.252 --> 15:13.196
As he told Dave Randall, I don't believe in the rule of the dead hand.

15:13.897 --> 15:15.819
Was that in Randall's book, by the way?

15:16.761 --> 15:21.287
I don't know if that's in the book, because the book covers Dave's years as a... In New York.

15:21.507 --> 15:30.038
In New York, as a bookseller, rather than as a librarian here, although there is a chapter in there on Mr. Lilly and selling books to him.

15:30.098 --> 15:31.300
Do it once more for me?

15:31.861 --> 15:33.002
Do it once more for me?

15:33.370 --> 15:34.291
What did he say to Dave?

15:34.311 --> 15:36.395
He said that he didn't believe in the rule of the dead hand.

15:37.256 --> 15:40.220
So he wasn't going to give his books with restrictions.

15:40.701 --> 15:45.368
There are no restrictions at all on how this library is to go or what we're to do with it.

15:46.109 --> 15:48.213
So it's entirely up to the university.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.515
Is it a very interesting will?

15:50.656 --> 15:55.824
As I'm going along, there are some extraordinary wills I've encountered, you know, starting with Pepys' will.

15:56.004 --> 15:57.066
I've never seen Mr. Lovey's will.

15:57.086 --> 16:01.032
You know, like Newbery's will and Curran's will and...

16:01.535 --> 16:11.648
Well, Mr. Lilly died with a will that had been written many, many years before he even began book collecting.

16:12.710 --> 16:22.162
And because he had not left a good will, his estate wound up paying vast sum in taxes.

16:22.943 --> 16:27.669
So his gold coin collection went to the Smithsonian, if you can imagine.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.613
In those days, they allowed him...

16:30.982 --> 16:37.310
whatever the legal $35 an ounce or something there was on gold, what it would be worth today.

16:38.892 --> 16:40.073
It was a vast collection.

16:40.634 --> 16:45.219
And anyway, we were not in his will.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.964
Well, the books came prior to his... Oh, yes, they were a gift during his lifetime.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.766
Oh, that's great.

16:51.126 --> 16:51.707
True.

16:51.727 --> 16:56.473
You probably wouldn't have gotten them then, had he died before... Oh, absolutely not.

16:56.733 --> 16:56.913
No.

16:57.093 --> 17:00.618
They probably wouldn't... They were not mentioned in the world.

17:00.658 --> 17:00.938
Exactly.

17:01.525 --> 17:02.466
Oh, so there is no will.

17:02.967 --> 17:06.012
He gave these... See, I didn't know this.

17:06.052 --> 17:14.845
They're not in any way... There's no... He simply wrote a letter to Herman Wells and said, it's my intention to give my collection of books to the university.

17:14.925 --> 17:19.772
And he did it over a period of two years, and it was just a simple mistake.

17:19.792 --> 17:21.374
Is there a chance I could get a copy of that letter?

17:22.035 --> 17:23.978
Maybe you could arrange for somebody to send it to me.

17:23.998 --> 17:24.899
I'll call it in next week.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.965
I think if you bought the 25th anniversary book, it's quoted in there.

17:28.986 --> 17:30.448
The letter is quoted in there?

17:30.468 --> 17:30.568
Yeah.

17:30.588 --> 17:30.688
Okay.

17:31.394 --> 17:35.180
In full.

17:35.200 --> 17:35.941
That's excellent.

17:36.001 --> 17:39.166
It's in the historical introduction that Cecil Berg wrote.

17:39.206 --> 17:45.817
My opening chapter really, it starts... It does give you the flexibility.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.820
It gave you a great collection right off the bat.

17:47.860 --> 17:51.426
You arrived full-blown with a great collection.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.868
Is that a fair statement?

17:52.888 --> 17:54.411
That's a fair statement.

17:57.075 --> 17:57.756
We've added...

17:58.175 --> 18:23.671
so many great collections to Mr. Lilly's collection, starting with the Poole collection that brought us our Gutenberg Bible and some other marvelous early printed books, the Mendel collection that brought us our wonderful resources on the Spanish colonial empire, followed by the Boxer collection that brought us Dutch and Portuguese voyage material and colonial materials, so that we have collection after collection after collection.

18:24.132 --> 18:27.777
So the library, like any great library, is a collection of collections.

18:28.145 --> 18:37.215
So many different individuals and their tastes have gone into forming those collections that then come together to build the great libraries.

18:37.255 --> 18:47.446
And this is true whether you go to giant places like the British Museum and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, or whether you go to smaller but diverse libraries like this one.

18:47.946 --> 18:52.291
It's a combination of tastes and interests of many, many different people.

18:54.794 --> 18:57.797
You mentioned a Lincoln collection.

18:58.081 --> 19:11.033
The Lincoln Collection was formed by a man named Oakeshott, who lived in Moline, Illinois, and it was acquired by the university, I think, in 1940, if I'm not mistaken.

19:11.053 --> 19:15.096
But again, the historical material is all outlined in the book that you have.

19:15.457 --> 19:19.520
But it's a book collection, or is it a manuscript?

19:19.540 --> 19:28.088
It's a three books, but it included first printings of various speeches and other writings of Lincoln, but it also included

19:28.422 --> 19:31.848
hundreds and hundreds of books about Lincoln, contemporary publications.

19:33.009 --> 19:43.687
Let's go back, and again, not comparing it to Texas, because it's two different operations, but we're Dr. Wells and Harry Ransom kind of going at the same time.

19:43.967 --> 19:54.244
In Texas, they made the decision that all the great stuff was gone, so to speak, of previous centuries, and that they would focus on the 20th century.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.362
I gather that wasn't the thought.

19:58.083 --> 20:03.968
It wasn't the thought, but you can go back to, was it Charles Dibdin or Thomas?

20:03.988 --> 20:04.869
Thomas Farwell.

20:05.029 --> 20:14.817
Dibdin, who complained in the 1830s that all of the great Greek manuscripts were already in libraries and that there would be nothing left for discerning collectors in the future.

20:15.398 --> 20:17.800
While he's writing this, Dickens is writing pickwick papers.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.343
Today, a perfect pickwick is a collector's dream.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.265
So it's all relative.

20:24.548 --> 20:30.014
No, we have never had the philosophy that we would concentrate only on one century.

20:30.054 --> 20:46.752
In fact, we have many collections of earlier materials, the voyage material that I was mentioning to you before, the archives of the Archbishop of Quito, manuscript collections like the Thomas Parker papers, who was Lord Chancellor of the Exchequer in the reign of Queen Anne.

20:47.473 --> 20:52.058
Manuscript materials from the 16th, 17th, 18th century are very welcome,

20:52.645 --> 21:00.113
It's true that in this time they're less frequently met with than they were perhaps a hundred years ago.

21:00.894 --> 21:08.963
And on the other hand, we're producing great quantities of writers and writers' papers and politicians and scientists and so on.

21:08.983 --> 21:10.485
And we collect in those areas, too.

21:10.585 --> 21:13.068
And we have archives of several publishing houses.

21:13.128 --> 21:21.657
We have the papers of Herman Muller, who won the Nobel Prize for genetics and his work on...

21:21.974 --> 21:29.223
Radiation, changes caused by radiation, drops of phylla, a type of fruit fly.

21:30.104 --> 21:32.927
So, you know, there are just many different types of things available.

21:33.107 --> 21:37.532
It becomes pretty much a matter of what you're fortunate enough to acquire.

21:38.493 --> 21:43.840
We have a wonderful collection of early books on Scotland, for example, Scotland, up to the Act of Union in 1707.

21:44.400 --> 21:50.007
Because a private collector had assembled this wonderful collection, we had the opportunity to purchase it, which we did.

21:50.662 --> 22:18.357
so we we did not decide to concentrate as texas did and nor could we have afforded to compete with texas in buying the collections that they did we simply did not have uh funding on that scale uh papers of george bernard shaw and dh lawrence and things of the sort are pricey items so i was just going through the papers of silver up at the newbury yesterday and i did not know that story that's a wonderful story texas was all separate

22:18.775 --> 22:21.918
give them $2.8 million, that's like in 1964.

22:22.779 --> 22:26.203
And if you're familiar with that, then there was a very splashy story.

22:28.426 --> 22:31.048
Chicago came up with some money, you know.

22:31.068 --> 22:31.169
Yeah.

22:31.189 --> 22:37.576
And so then they sued, but then Fleming sued the state of the... So it was a really, really great story.

22:37.716 --> 22:41.480
But Texas County was able to come up with close to $3 million, just like that.

22:41.520 --> 22:41.760
Sure.

22:42.381 --> 22:46.285
You know, and what was great about this story is that they decided to sell duplicates.

22:46.737 --> 22:47.838
to try and fund it.

22:47.858 --> 22:49.880
They came out for three or four million dollars.

22:49.900 --> 22:50.961
Then they had a big sale.

22:51.642 --> 22:53.264
It was very interesting.

22:53.324 --> 22:54.285
You do purchase a lot.

22:54.325 --> 22:56.808
You do have a kind of a warrant list, I think.

22:58.429 --> 23:01.072
You keep an active list of people that you're interested in.

23:01.132 --> 23:01.673
Isn't that right?

23:01.693 --> 23:02.954
We have several, actually.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.338
French, English, and American literature.

23:07.579 --> 23:15.107
Lists that are quite extensive and in the hands of a small number of booksellers because if you have everybody looking for the same book, it's chaotic.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.685
And that could kind of affect the market in a way.

23:18.705 --> 23:19.826
It could, indeed, yes.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.750
But we do collect from lists.

23:22.850 --> 23:26.094
We're developing new lists in new fields all the time.

23:26.695 --> 23:40.352
We're surveying existing collections that we have and finding out what the key books are that we're missing and then developing lists of books that we need to support, let's say, English voyages and exploration or whatever.

23:40.832 --> 23:44.757
So we just have to...

23:45.327 --> 23:49.574
and to use that as one of the various methods by which we develop and strengthen our collections.

23:49.634 --> 23:52.479
It's this basic thing of adding strength to the existing collections.

23:53.260 --> 23:56.145
How do you find things?

23:56.445 --> 24:00.091
I mean, how do you find new things?

24:00.111 --> 24:02.936
Is it serendipitous to hear about things?

24:03.036 --> 24:06.923
Are you out there actively looking for certain... Of course.

24:06.963 --> 24:08.705
I would imagine this is your job.

24:08.886 --> 24:10.048
This is basically what I do.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.111
Give me an idea of...

24:12.496 --> 24:19.368
Well, in the about three minutes that we have left, because I really must... Give me three minutes.

24:19.889 --> 24:24.056
It's a matter of developing a network of personal contacts all over the world.

24:24.637 --> 24:32.931
And you do this by traveling, by visiting booksellers, by private contacts that you make with collectors.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.377
And I go to Europe...

24:37.066 --> 24:39.388
either to the continent or to England every summer.

24:39.708 --> 24:51.839
We usually make a quick trip to Italy and to Paris at Christmas time to visit booksellers, to see collectors, and to find out about things that are relatable.

24:52.820 --> 25:05.672
And it's through this method means that we really come into contact with a number of collections, already assembled collections that have been offered to us through booksellers, largely.

25:06.108 --> 25:13.315
but also the papers of different families, this type of material, the sort of thing that scholars come here to use in the library.

25:13.695 --> 25:15.557
But it's being out in the field.

25:15.577 --> 25:17.299
You don't get it just by reading catalogs.

25:17.859 --> 25:35.136
You go out and you make friends, you discuss what the library's needs are with them, and so when an opportunity comes along for them to disperse or dispose of a collection to sell it en bloc or any bits, they remember what your interests are.

25:36.179 --> 25:44.569
Any one acquisition that comes to mind that's given you the greatest satisfaction or great satisfaction?

25:44.589 --> 25:45.050
Oh, gosh.

25:47.132 --> 25:47.693
Not really.

25:47.733 --> 25:53.820
There are many of the big collections that we've acquired that are really quite wonderful.

25:54.301 --> 26:04.954
I think probably the greatest satisfaction, personal satisfaction, I've had in building the library here is what I've done not in acquiring collections but in

26:05.390 --> 26:13.037
building up some of our contemporary materials, British, French, and American authors, principally.

26:13.437 --> 26:27.851
When I came here in 1962 as the librarian for English in the university library, before I came over to the Lilly some four years later, I started the want-list business and decided that I would order not just a copy for the main library, but a second copy for Lilly.

26:28.171 --> 26:29.372
Talked to Dave Randall about this.

26:29.412 --> 26:29.973
That was fine.

26:29.993 --> 26:31.734
We drew up a list of all these.

26:31.754 --> 26:34.637
So that we had bought at publication price

26:35.360 --> 26:39.085
new books by writers that we feel are significant.

26:39.405 --> 26:40.827
And we've had them on standing order.

26:40.947 --> 26:48.457
And as those books have been published, the booksellers have automatically sent us copies of the first edition and variant issues and so on.

26:48.817 --> 27:00.252
So that we have extensive collections now of some 400 British and American writers, everything that they've published, limited editions, broadsides, whatever it is.

27:00.913 --> 27:04.017
So that for 30 years now, 28 years, we've been doing this,

27:04.891 --> 27:08.756
I continue this until I retire, whatever, however many years.

27:09.878 --> 27:19.250
I will leave the library with a very strong collection of the materials that came out during the time that I was curator of the library.

27:19.270 --> 27:19.791
This is great.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.574
This alone is worth a trip, trust me.

27:23.135 --> 27:23.896
This is good stuff.

27:24.577 --> 27:26.500
You can always buy other people's collections.

27:27.381 --> 27:29.363
That's the way libraries are always built.

27:29.504 --> 27:32.788
But doing this, this is something that I just wanted to do myself.

27:33.376 --> 27:34.998
And did you pick the authors?

27:35.018 --> 27:45.273
I picked the authors initially, but then I sent the list around to people in the English department, and then I sent it around to booksellers, because booksellers frequently know more about these than English professors.

27:46.495 --> 28:01.797
You read book catalogs, you see new names coming up, you add that person to a list, I'll spot somebody, read a couple reviews, see that this person's written four books and that they've all been well received, fire a note off to the person in London who handles our English list and say, put this person on the list.

28:02.131 --> 28:05.696
or write to the books that are in New York because the Americans, add this person.

28:05.716 --> 28:07.198
Or they'll write and suggest somebody to me.

28:07.218 --> 28:10.181
So it's grown up by input from a lot of different people.

28:10.201 --> 28:13.105
And you have a regular budget to cover this?

28:13.786 --> 28:15.548
It comes out of our regular acquisition fund.

28:15.668 --> 28:16.610
It's not that much money.

28:16.670 --> 28:17.871
And it's about 400 authors?

28:19.153 --> 28:20.114
British and American, about 400.

28:20.174 --> 28:21.956
And it's all fiction and poetry.

28:22.377 --> 28:24.239
Fiction, poetry, essays.

28:24.279 --> 28:25.221
Yes, it's literature.

28:25.942 --> 28:26.983
Literary figures.

28:28.024 --> 28:28.645
And...

28:28.979 --> 28:30.281
I think it's been very successful.

28:30.581 --> 28:31.022
That's great.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.746
It's rather like laying down a wine cellar for the next generation.

28:35.109 --> 28:36.671
See, there's always something different.

28:36.691 --> 28:37.332
That's wonderful.

28:38.754 --> 28:39.375
You have to go.

28:39.435 --> 28:41.679
This was a bonus for me, by the way.

28:41.859 --> 28:44.844
Identify yourself.

28:45.244 --> 28:45.765
Okay.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.331
I'm Joel Silver and head of public services at the Lilly Library.

28:50.532 --> 28:51.394
Just tell me where.

28:51.554 --> 28:54.158
Just go ahead and talk and pick it up.

28:54.198 --> 28:55.120
Okay.

28:55.140 --> 28:57.383
Right now we're in the Lincoln Room.

28:57.683 --> 29:06.596
If anyone wants to use the library, then they would stop at the reception desk and inform the receptionist that they will be using the reading room.

29:07.097 --> 29:09.501
The reading room is open to anybody who wants to use it.

29:09.521 --> 29:10.963
Do you have to apply for a card?

29:11.464 --> 29:16.592
No, you need to present identification, but otherwise we're open to anybody.

29:16.652 --> 29:18.855
You don't need to write in advance or make arrangements.

29:18.875 --> 29:24.163
This is the staff entrance to the reading room.

29:26.793 --> 29:34.743
And so on Saturdays, we're open from 9 to 1, and we usually get a few people working.

29:34.783 --> 29:45.877
The books and manuscripts are used only in this room.

29:45.897 --> 29:47.299
Now we're going to the treasure rooms.

29:48.340 --> 29:54.488
Yeah, but actually the working area, it gets a little less elegant back here.

29:56.273 --> 30:00.758
I don't know how much Mr. Cagle told you about the way the building is set up.

30:01.459 --> 30:06.745
When you came into the building, you came in on the third floor of what is a seven-story building.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.167
We're on three right now.

30:08.227 --> 30:15.135
The third floor contains some reference books, some work areas for the cataloging department.

30:16.477 --> 30:18.760
Here, part of our reference collection is here.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.102
The rest is on the fourth floor.

30:21.663 --> 30:25.808
Each of these areas back here contains cataloging

30:26.463 --> 30:29.166
work areas, staff work space, and so forth.

30:40.058 --> 30:42.420
What's the capacity of a building, you know, offhand?

30:42.680 --> 30:44.322
It is very close to what we have.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.945
This is water, by the way, right?

30:47.085 --> 30:49.408
Is this the fire system?

30:49.428 --> 30:51.610
Yeah, this is the fire system.

30:52.315 --> 30:56.483
here, which runs all through the stacks, but there's no water in the pipes.

30:56.543 --> 31:02.515
It's a dry pipe system, and the pipes only fill when the fire alarm sensors indicate that they should.

31:02.755 --> 31:05.721
And one hopes that you get here prior to that.

31:05.941 --> 31:06.342
Yes.

31:08.025 --> 31:12.394
But the fire system in the vault is not water-based.

31:12.414 --> 31:13.696
It's a halon gas system.

31:13.716 --> 31:14.357
Oh, it is halon.

31:14.518 --> 31:14.678
Yeah.

31:17.054 --> 31:21.399
which will work down in the vaults, but won't work in areas, which is kind of falling out of favor now.

31:21.419 --> 31:22.961
Yeah, because of the fluorocarbons.

31:23.101 --> 31:23.722
Exactly, right.

31:24.503 --> 31:30.650
I was at Jason Brown a couple weeks ago, and I guess they were just finishing their building.

31:30.830 --> 31:35.776
So they said, we could have got the A-line in, and the grandfather didn't.

31:37.077 --> 31:38.339
Yeah.

31:38.359 --> 31:40.061
Pretty fancy wire type of thing.

31:40.121 --> 31:41.502
Well, I get a security track.

31:41.522 --> 31:42.463
Prevent the fire.

31:42.503 --> 31:43.084
That's right.

31:44.225 --> 31:45.527
Where are you from?

31:45.547 --> 31:46.107
Massachusetts.

31:46.127 --> 31:46.588
What part?

31:46.838 --> 31:48.100
Worcester?

31:48.400 --> 31:49.842
Oh, I'm from Baldwin.

31:49.862 --> 31:50.863
Was that right?

31:50.883 --> 31:51.704
How long have you been up here?

31:51.885 --> 31:57.272
Oh, well, we moved to Los Angeles when I was eight, and I've been here since 81.

31:57.412 --> 31:57.973
Oh, really?

31:57.993 --> 31:59.495
Yeah.

31:59.515 --> 32:03.440
Now, what precisely do you do in the library?

32:03.460 --> 32:14.314
I mean, your title is... As head of public services, and that includes all reference and reference activities for printed books, operation of the reading room, supervision of the stacks,

32:14.564 --> 32:18.868
supervision of the exhibitions and publications program, a number of pretty busy men.

32:19.108 --> 32:21.130
Yes.

32:22.011 --> 32:23.413
We are now on the seventh floor.

32:23.813 --> 32:32.762
The library classes its books in Library of Congress call number order, beginning with the A's, and the A's start up here on seven.

32:33.502 --> 32:43.272
As you notice, all the lights on the stack floor are off unless somebody is working on that floor.

32:44.163 --> 32:54.093
We start here on the A's, and wherever possible, we put books in boxes, protective cases, to protect them from light.

32:54.253 --> 32:55.654
These are books in here.

32:56.235 --> 33:02.441
Actually, what these are in here are the Haldim and Julius little big books.

33:02.962 --> 33:03.802
So it starts here.

33:03.842 --> 33:08.347
Since we're in the A's, we have encyclopedias and so forth.

33:08.948 --> 33:11.470
So it's all alphabetic.

33:12.277 --> 33:14.980
It's not classified according to subject matters.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.944
Well, yeah, the Library of Congress classification is subject.

33:17.964 --> 33:18.544
Okay, I'm sorry.

33:18.564 --> 33:26.634
So, yeah, with the A's being encyclopedias in general series, down to the Z's being bibliography.

33:26.654 --> 33:28.155
Okay, gotcha.

33:28.536 --> 33:30.999
So, up here we have, I think, the A's and B's.

33:31.419 --> 33:31.980
Right.

33:32.921 --> 33:38.067
So, this is the seventh floor, which is right under the roof, and it's the smallest stack in the floor.

33:40.009 --> 33:40.950
But you can see...

33:41.723 --> 33:44.206
how the books are housed.

33:44.226 --> 33:46.049
Materials are oversized.

33:46.069 --> 33:48.873
We try whenever possible to shove them flat.

33:50.876 --> 33:51.437
Good idea.

33:52.178 --> 33:56.303
What are you doing with Boston Gazettes, I wonder?

33:56.904 --> 34:02.993
These particularly are from the War of 1812, and we have a big War of 1812 collection.

34:03.033 --> 34:03.313
I see.

34:03.333 --> 34:08.561
There's the Bellefont, B-E-L-L-E-F-O-N-T-E, Patriot, which is Pennsylvania.

34:08.581 --> 34:10.363
Boston Gazette.

34:10.934 --> 34:11.254
Yeah.

34:11.274 --> 34:12.877
The Columbian center.

34:12.897 --> 34:15.540
You know, all centering around the period of the War of 1812.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.182
Now, is this one individual's collection?

34:17.823 --> 34:18.244
I don't know.

34:18.264 --> 34:24.112
I think a lot of it was, but I don't know how specifically we built up the War of 1812 collection.

34:24.152 --> 34:25.253
Interesting collection, though.

34:25.273 --> 34:25.434
Yeah.

34:25.974 --> 34:28.598
Well, we did an exhibition of that several years ago.

34:30.380 --> 34:33.945
We're going to have to do six more, which is the largest of the stacked doors.

34:35.267 --> 34:36.148
Is this for the real?

34:37.293 --> 35:02.254
fancy dancy stuff is no not necessarily the real fancy stuff is in the vault but this is the uh books oh yeah these are all new accessions the from here now to the end are books that we've acquired in the last several years but can i take a look at some of those because i mr cable was mentioning that you do have a standard want list

35:02.521 --> 35:04.245
and things just kind of come automatically.

35:04.466 --> 35:19.601
Right, but a lot of those get cataloged as soon as they come in, so you can't tell from this what those are, because a lot of that is modern literature, and that's fairly quick to catalog, so a lot of it does get cataloged, but you're welcome to take a look at the kinds of things.

35:19.621 --> 35:20.142
Okay.

35:29.723 --> 35:36.791
Some of the things that are here are here because they're difficult to catalog, and the catalogers haven't selected these first.

35:36.811 --> 35:39.775
But these would be considered rare books, per se?

35:39.895 --> 35:43.819
Well, rare books would fit into one of our research collections that we have here.

35:44.100 --> 35:51.488
Some of these books may duplicate what other campus libraries have, but here they'll be part of the research collection.

35:51.629 --> 35:58.937
We collect, as I'm sure

35:59.491 --> 36:02.175
Okay, they've told you in a wide variety of areas.

36:02.395 --> 36:03.998
Yeah, that's just very interesting.

36:04.399 --> 36:10.788
There's an Edna O'Brien book that was titled about five or six years ago, A Fanatic Heart.

36:10.808 --> 36:12.771
She inscribed that to me.

36:12.851 --> 36:16.377
My day job is I'm the book review editor at the Worcester Telegram.

36:16.397 --> 36:20.002
And this book I'm doing, I'm writing for Random House.

36:24.389 --> 36:24.850
This is fun.

36:24.910 --> 36:28.215
I had a very, pardon me for being interested in

36:29.714 --> 36:33.118
what some might think mundane things, but never is.

36:33.138 --> 36:42.010
I'm very interested in recent acquisitions as well as, I mean, recently published acquisitions.

36:42.030 --> 36:42.951
Okay, that's fine.

36:42.971 --> 36:45.274
I just ordered a little one.

36:45.294 --> 36:45.754
All right.

36:45.774 --> 36:48.778
Let me show you what you saw with the things on this board.

36:48.798 --> 36:58.911
A lot of the things on this board, because of the way the facilitation is called art and British and American history, and we're in the law area right now,

37:00.258 --> 37:04.603
but this is all British history, and this is part of our sheet music collection.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.406
Oh, I've heard about that, yeah.

37:06.506 --> 37:13.434
More than 100,000 pieces of sheet music, and that's what all of these boxes... You have to switch off?

37:14.155 --> 37:14.455
Yeah.

37:15.957 --> 37:18.540
We have... This is all these shelves of sheet music?

37:18.560 --> 37:19.221
Yeah, all of that.

37:19.341 --> 37:20.423
One, two, three.

37:21.204 --> 37:22.625
Three bookcases full of sheet books.

37:22.746 --> 37:25.789
Oh, three, actually six.

37:25.809 --> 37:28.693
You mean three ranges full... That's what you call them, ranges, right?

37:28.713 --> 37:28.813
Yeah.

37:29.857 --> 37:32.060
Three ranges, which is actually six.

37:34.383 --> 37:35.265
Six sides, right?

37:35.585 --> 37:36.787
Yeah.

37:36.807 --> 37:41.473
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, twelve.

37:42.635 --> 37:43.716
That's a lot of sheet music.

37:43.736 --> 37:49.605
Yeah, it is a lot of sheet music, mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries.

37:52.569 --> 37:52.729
Okay.

37:52.929 --> 37:55.873
And this collection is described in that really 20th anniversary.

37:55.893 --> 37:56.635
Which I have, yeah.

37:56.895 --> 37:56.995
Okay.

38:03.050 --> 38:06.214
This is a conservation area.

38:06.435 --> 38:10.320
We do conservation work on our collections here.

38:10.520 --> 38:15.567
And we need a larger space, but we're working on that.

38:15.587 --> 38:20.153
And if we ever do get an addition to the building, then there'll be plans for a much larger conservation area.

38:20.194 --> 38:26.382
But we make, in this area, many of our folding protective cases.

38:26.402 --> 38:32.230
This is the kind of work that we're doing now, for example, making bronzes.

38:32.733 --> 38:35.896
like this.

38:36.036 --> 38:41.160
And these are made mainly by part-time student workers.

38:41.180 --> 38:41.641
That's great.

38:42.021 --> 38:43.042
Those things are expensive.

38:43.062 --> 38:44.783
Yeah.

38:44.803 --> 38:51.449
And we also do paper repair, and we're starting to do some crop and leather.

38:52.210 --> 38:55.012
How about the deacidifying?

38:55.052 --> 38:55.673
Do you do that here?

38:55.693 --> 38:56.614
Do you send that out?

38:56.714 --> 38:58.515
Well, we don't do very much of it.

38:58.535 --> 39:00.137
We just do a little.

39:00.157 --> 39:01.558
We do some encapsulation.

39:01.825 --> 39:06.289
But we just have not done a lot of these at a time.

39:06.309 --> 39:09.432
But this gives you an idea of the way the books are housed.

39:09.512 --> 39:14.557
We have these acid-free flags with the car numbers on them in each of the books.

39:14.657 --> 39:17.179
And the stacks are arranged pretty well.

39:17.239 --> 39:19.381
They're clean and orderly.

39:20.142 --> 39:21.863
You visited other libraries.

39:21.903 --> 39:23.084
How do they compare?

39:23.104 --> 39:24.866
It's right in there, you know.

39:25.627 --> 39:27.548
This is the third in two days.

39:27.568 --> 39:29.250
You did the lily.

39:29.517 --> 39:36.245
Reagan's up at Chicago, yeah, which is pretty enormous too, I have to say.

39:37.466 --> 39:41.691
So this gives you an idea of how this vacuum is.

39:41.711 --> 39:52.905
I've got about 20 institutions I'm including in the study on both coasts, HRC, it's going to be a good book, and 20 major and individuals, contemporary collectors.

39:53.025 --> 39:53.505
Oh really?

39:53.526 --> 39:53.986
Yes.

39:54.006 --> 39:55.668
Who are some of them?

39:55.688 --> 39:56.829
William Scheide.

39:56.849 --> 39:57.330
Oh yeah.

39:57.631 --> 39:58.893
Carter Burden, L.D.

39:58.933 --> 40:04.382
Brodsky, Sanford Burdener out in Carmel, who has a great William Morris collection.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.425
Chef Zathamari from Chicago.

40:07.266 --> 40:08.468
Sam Rosenthal.

40:10.191 --> 40:11.432
Ricky Jay, the magician.

40:11.533 --> 40:12.354
I know Ricky Jay.

40:12.454 --> 40:14.077
Say hello for me.

40:14.738 --> 40:20.346
For you from when I used to live in Los Angeles.

40:20.386 --> 40:21.548
I'm back on the tape now.

40:21.608 --> 40:22.710
Okay, so this is all...

40:23.146 --> 40:33.302
European literature, and then English literature begins right here and goes for the rest of this range, beginning with the early English literature.

40:33.322 --> 40:37.108
This, for example, is a complete collection of Pondstock Press.

40:37.128 --> 40:37.829
Oh, really?

40:37.849 --> 40:37.950
Yeah.

40:37.970 --> 40:38.871
Where's the Chaucer?

40:39.031 --> 40:41.035
In a vault.

40:41.055 --> 40:44.700
And that's all from Mr. Louie's library.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.905
Oh, you're from Mr. Louie's library.

40:47.926 --> 40:48.867
Yeah, he had all of them.

40:58.162 --> 41:00.325
Was Mr. Lilly a really dedicated collector?

41:00.645 --> 41:02.207
Did he really know his stuff?

41:02.228 --> 41:05.592
Yeah, he really... Because he seems to have collected a lot of different things, not just books.

41:05.652 --> 41:13.983
No, yeah, he collected a large number of things, but he collected only what he was interested in, and he tried to get the best advice he could in each of the fields.

41:15.465 --> 41:19.391
So this is more recent English literature here.

41:20.412 --> 41:21.373
Yes, Naipola.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.017
What's a Naipola?

41:24.402 --> 41:30.569
Now, in a case like NYPD, do you have English, German, American, or actually the folies come out quite there?

41:30.849 --> 41:31.109
Yeah.

41:31.550 --> 41:37.757
I think mostly when we collect, our collecting policies may have varied over the years, but Bill would know more about that.

41:37.777 --> 41:44.264
But I think if the way we're collecting presently, if the author is English, we're collecting English first.

41:44.284 --> 41:44.764
Makes sense.

41:44.845 --> 41:45.766
Follow the flag.

41:45.786 --> 41:47.147
Yeah.

41:48.809 --> 41:51.232
Where's the Fleming collection?

41:51.252 --> 41:51.692
Yeah, Fleming.

41:51.872 --> 41:52.313
Is that around?

41:52.393 --> 41:54.375
Yeah.

41:54.997 --> 41:59.444
No, these are the prints of things.

41:59.524 --> 42:00.986
Are these his own books?

42:01.547 --> 42:04.551
Yeah, the ones that are bound this way are his own copies.

42:05.353 --> 42:05.953
OK.

42:06.034 --> 42:09.058
Why don't you just take it out?

42:09.078 --> 42:10.160
You've got his book plate in there.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.465
No, they don't.

42:13.485 --> 42:15.989
These were Fleming's own copies of his books.

42:16.369 --> 42:17.611
Of his James Bond books.

42:17.631 --> 42:18.092
That's right.

42:18.532 --> 42:21.156
And so you can see that they have them specially bound.

42:21.897 --> 42:23.059
For your eyes only.

42:23.360 --> 42:23.620
Yeah.

42:23.819 --> 42:27.323
That was a pretty nice one.

42:27.803 --> 42:39.677
So we don't have a copy of the first edition of Casino Royale in dust jacket, but we do have Fleming's own copy, you know, specially bound for him with his note.

42:40.377 --> 42:41.659
What is his note?

42:41.679 --> 42:41.919
I can't ask.

42:41.939 --> 42:48.506
This was written in January and February 1952, accepted by Capes in the spring and published a year later.

42:49.247 --> 42:53.472
That's something in Fleming.

42:53.992 --> 42:55.113
I love weather.

42:57.436 --> 42:59.839
But you don't have the first with the dust jacket.

42:59.979 --> 43:02.222
Is that something you'd buy if you saw it in the catalog?

43:02.422 --> 43:05.406
At a reasonable price, probably it would.

43:05.426 --> 43:10.572
But here's the first without the dust jacket.

43:10.592 --> 43:12.354
His science books would be elsewhere, right?

43:12.374 --> 43:13.035
Yes.

43:13.375 --> 43:15.378
They're mainly down on the fourth floor.

43:15.458 --> 43:16.299
I can show you those.

43:16.319 --> 43:18.161
So you bought Bruce Chatwin.

43:18.722 --> 43:23.728
I'm just trying to get a feel for some of the people you've decided are worth collecting.

43:25.227 --> 43:33.976
I need a book now, I have a Y selection.

43:34.036 --> 43:36.418
I do not know Bridget Goffey.

43:36.438 --> 43:39.021
That's a contemporary writer?

43:39.041 --> 43:41.243
Must be British, right?

43:41.263 --> 43:41.584
Yeah.

43:41.604 --> 43:42.925
E-L-I-G-I-D-G-L-O-P-H-Y.

43:43.666 --> 43:45.107
So these are all British, basically?

43:45.127 --> 43:46.489
Yeah, this floor is all British.

43:46.589 --> 43:47.790
Oh, okay, okay.

43:47.810 --> 43:49.832
Yeah, we'll be moving down to the Americas.

43:50.573 --> 43:50.773
Okay.

43:51.694 --> 43:53.075
John Le Carre, of course.

43:53.596 --> 43:54.677
There must be on that one.

43:55.670 --> 44:02.118
I'm just going to get a couple more names.

44:02.178 --> 44:02.779
Anthony Price.

44:05.623 --> 44:07.565
Christopher Priest, P-L-I-E-S-T.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.452
That's a nice, interesting thing to do.

44:12.512 --> 44:14.074
I think that's great.

44:14.094 --> 44:15.516
It's to buy stuff.

44:15.556 --> 44:17.058
A few cars over here.

44:17.779 --> 44:19.301
That makes sense, doesn't it?

44:20.322 --> 44:20.823
Let's see.

44:20.943 --> 44:22.605
I've still got somebody working up here.

44:27.310 --> 44:27.830
What's four?

44:28.211 --> 44:30.753
Almost exclusively American literature.

44:31.113 --> 44:34.937
Just a small portion of bibliography at the end.

44:34.957 --> 44:40.081
This is 18th and 19th century American literature here.

44:40.201 --> 44:44.065
The big American collections are here.

44:44.085 --> 44:47.888
Here's much of our Clemens collection, the Mark Twain material.

44:48.068 --> 44:49.810
Some of it is in the vault.

44:49.970 --> 44:51.171
These are his books?

44:51.191 --> 44:56.035
No, books written by... I was just going to say, because the bindings are... No, these are all boxes.

44:56.167 --> 44:57.028
Oh, that's a box?

44:57.048 --> 44:57.909
Yeah.

44:58.169 --> 44:58.389
Okay.

44:58.409 --> 44:58.669
All right.

44:58.989 --> 45:02.833
They look like bindings, don't they?

45:02.853 --> 45:03.073
Yeah.

45:03.113 --> 45:03.473
From here.

45:03.894 --> 45:04.034
Uh-huh.

45:05.856 --> 45:06.176
Oh, good.

45:06.196 --> 45:07.877
So they are in their original bindings, then?

45:08.097 --> 45:09.399
Yeah.

45:09.459 --> 45:14.303
That's the point.

45:14.323 --> 45:14.543
Oh, yeah.

45:14.563 --> 45:14.663
Good.

45:14.823 --> 45:15.644
Ken Kesey?

45:16.465 --> 45:16.605
Uh-huh.

45:16.625 --> 45:17.886
Yeah, here's some of the modern.

45:17.986 --> 45:18.707
Okay.

45:19.568 --> 45:24.672
This is interesting to me, actually.

45:29.191 --> 45:30.593
Oh, Joe Heller, of course.

45:31.934 --> 45:36.480
Do you get any of these inscribed, or do you get them signed, or do you just get the first trades?

45:36.500 --> 45:39.663
No, some of them we have inscribed.

45:39.763 --> 45:45.170
I don't know specifically what the Heller is.

45:45.190 --> 45:47.332
John Gardner, the late John Gardner.

45:47.713 --> 45:48.053
That's right.

45:48.073 --> 45:48.694
William Gladys.

45:50.916 --> 45:54.641
Don DeLillo is Libra, which was just published last year.

45:55.922 --> 45:59.046
And so here's a whole shelf, and that's an interesting title, because that's

46:00.342 --> 46:05.527
Not if it's written by DeLillo, Amazon, but it's not signed by DeLillo.

46:05.567 --> 46:06.769
Nicholas Delbanco.

46:08.590 --> 46:11.854
You've got the whole shelf on DeLillo.

46:13.976 --> 46:16.338
James Dickey.

46:16.359 --> 46:17.440
Evan S. Connell.

46:18.741 --> 46:21.384
Don't mind me on this, this is very, very interesting to me.

46:22.965 --> 46:26.569
I will have a, excuse me, Clark William Peter Blattie, that's interesting.

46:27.325 --> 46:28.887
I don't know how much we have.

46:28.907 --> 46:31.330
I wonder how many people would consider him a literary.

46:33.733 --> 46:35.755
Do you have a Faulkner collection?

46:35.775 --> 46:36.376
Oh, yeah.

46:36.396 --> 46:37.077
Let me show you that.

46:37.097 --> 46:39.019
Paul Brodeur, B-R-O-T-E-U-R.

46:39.720 --> 46:40.742
Donald Baselman.

46:47.810 --> 46:48.791
This is up in St.

46:48.892 --> 46:49.833
Clair over here.

46:49.913 --> 46:52.196
We have the archives of up in St.

46:52.216 --> 46:52.336
Clair.

46:52.376 --> 46:52.776
All right.

46:52.997 --> 46:54.919
That was telling you about that rhythm.

46:55.827 --> 47:05.418
Yeah, I just thought I could see some kind of material.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.141
This is what, I guess, had been offered to the Huntington.

47:09.102 --> 47:10.884
I'm looking for .

47:14.288 --> 47:14.648
Okay.

47:22.998 --> 47:24.940
Actually, we're looking for frostbite.

47:25.831 --> 47:32.979
Howard Fast.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.922
So you have the Library of America editions?

47:37.684 --> 47:41.168
That's tough to get in a nice jacket like that, like collected stories.

47:43.651 --> 47:44.512
It's fun to look at.

47:45.132 --> 47:47.175
So you have the two, these must be the two variants.

47:47.195 --> 47:51.940
One with the draft letter, the as I lay dying, and one with the regular letter.

47:52.865 --> 47:55.269
Uh, look at the condition that I've taken.

47:55.289 --> 47:59.856
Yeah, we're trying to buy books as Bill must have told you when he's finding a condition as well.

48:00.036 --> 48:05.925
And that's the Red Osier Press edition of Father Abraham, which the New York Public Library found in its events.

48:07.808 --> 48:08.249
Look at that.

48:08.289 --> 48:13.277
The green bough hardly ever comes with a spine that crisp and clear.

48:13.297 --> 48:15.300
Stand on my fly.

48:15.320 --> 48:19.646
We're talking my stuff now, stuff I know, as a collector.

48:19.807 --> 48:20.087
Okay.

48:20.506 --> 48:21.868
Let's see, what time is it?

48:21.888 --> 48:28.116
I want to make sure we get that.

48:28.657 --> 48:31.460
I guess it's this.

48:31.600 --> 48:31.841
Okay.

48:31.861 --> 48:33.803
You have an author here, John A. Williams.

48:34.945 --> 48:35.766
I don't really know him.

48:36.567 --> 48:39.851
The Man Who Cried I Am, the Junior Bachelor of Society.

48:40.512 --> 48:42.495
Then you have Wirt, W-I-I-T Williams.

48:44.377 --> 48:45.639
Larry Woolworth, of course.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.101
Donald Windham.

48:47.962 --> 48:48.943
Well, he's a little older.

48:50.324 --> 49:15.943
um see it is oh richard yates i love richard yates he was just here over the summer for a writer's workshop that'd be wonderful okay you've got to have ann tyler i can't believe you know it's just an alphabetical word there's jerry kaczynski blind date um

49:17.003 --> 49:18.425
Philip Roth, of course.

49:18.986 --> 49:22.793
Yeah, we're in the S's here.

49:23.173 --> 49:23.854
Jerry Sewell.

49:23.874 --> 49:25.036
I don't know Jerry Sewell.

49:25.117 --> 49:29.424
That's very hard to buy for his book.

49:30.125 --> 49:31.688
Do you have a whole shelf on, Tyler?

49:31.748 --> 49:33.891
Well, it starts here.

49:34.693 --> 49:35.814
Okay, you do have them all.

49:36.476 --> 49:36.696
Good.

49:36.816 --> 49:40.362
That's a very tough title for Clark Winder.

49:40.915 --> 49:42.497
Good, good, good, good.

49:42.517 --> 49:43.498
Okay, I'm happy now.

49:43.578 --> 49:45.900
Let's go to the vault.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.301
Okay.

49:47.321 --> 49:51.165
Yeah, I mean, you can tell which ones they are.

49:51.185 --> 49:52.346
They're in these kinds of cases.

49:52.627 --> 49:55.529
These are Ian Fleming's sign.

49:55.569 --> 49:57.271
This was a great collection, by the way.

49:57.291 --> 49:57.511
Yes.

49:57.531 --> 50:00.634
And I think Randall was very instrumental in bringing this to this hill, isn't it?

50:00.654 --> 50:00.995
Yes, he was.

50:01.075 --> 50:02.316
Randall together with Percy Muir.

50:02.336 --> 50:03.717
Yeah, and Percy Muir.

50:03.737 --> 50:06.320
Yeah, he had these special cases made.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.521
I thought he had a book plate.

50:07.561 --> 50:09.103
He didn't have a book plate, huh?

50:09.123 --> 50:09.403
No, he had.

50:09.805 --> 50:10.366
This.

50:10.666 --> 50:10.967
That.

50:11.307 --> 50:12.970
Okay, yeah.

50:12.990 --> 50:15.314
I knew he had a design or something like that, a device.

50:15.614 --> 50:16.836
Yeah.

50:16.856 --> 50:17.557
Okay, that's good.

50:17.697 --> 50:18.559
Let's move to the valve.

50:21.904 --> 50:22.505
Look at that though.

50:22.525 --> 50:23.747
That's a pretty old one.

50:23.767 --> 50:23.867
Yeah.

50:25.249 --> 50:26.932
It's called the script cellar.

50:27.893 --> 50:30.617
This is the 90 scripts department.

50:30.798 --> 50:31.138
Okay.

50:31.591 --> 50:35.736
I did an interview with Bill this morning.

50:35.756 --> 50:40.902
Yeah, and Bill asked me to show up as well.

50:40.962 --> 50:42.304
Yeah, okay.

50:42.504 --> 50:55.099
Oh, look at these big boxes, huh?

50:55.119 --> 50:58.223
Yeah, this is the big stuff.

50:59.975 --> 51:02.480
Now, we're down in the bowels of the building, right?

51:02.781 --> 51:06.187
Right.

51:06.207 --> 51:06.989
And here's the safe.

51:14.083 --> 51:15.767
Okay, tell me a little bit around where we are.

51:15.787 --> 51:18.051
Well, this is arranged the same way.

51:18.111 --> 51:19.855
I'm going to put this tape on the other side.

51:19.875 --> 51:19.975
Okay.
