WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:11.461
Sir, I'm buried at such and such a cemetery.

00:11.481 --> 00:12.422
No, no, no, no.

00:14.024 --> 00:23.616
You know, when I met with you a couple of weeks ago, we really didn't get into the things that are preoccupying your attention right now.

00:23.636 --> 00:28.722
And I wonder if briefly you could tell me the things that are really exciting you now and the things that you're working on.

00:29.140 --> 00:34.426
Well, first and foremost would be the completion of Hans von Gretel, which has been a project.

00:35.367 --> 00:42.396
This is the opera by Engelbert Humpedink, the original Engelbert Humpedink, which is now six years.

00:44.438 --> 00:52.027
It started as a project for one opera company, and that opera company fell through, and the project was shelved and was revived, blah, blah.

00:53.248 --> 00:55.131
Now, officially, it is opening.

00:55.231 --> 00:57.173
I will be in Houston...

00:57.440 --> 00:59.563
a little over a week from now for rehearsals.

01:00.324 --> 01:01.946
It'll open on the 24th.

01:02.367 --> 01:03.709
Huge project.

01:04.169 --> 01:05.131
24th of September.

01:05.151 --> 01:06.052
24th of October.

01:06.072 --> 01:07.013
October, sorry.

01:07.254 --> 01:08.255
October.

01:08.315 --> 01:09.257
September's gone.

01:09.277 --> 01:09.777
It's gone.

01:10.178 --> 01:23.457
I think probably this may be... I don't want to sound like Elizabeth Schwarzkopf who gave ten farewell concerts.

01:23.477 --> 01:23.717
Um...

01:24.338 --> 01:33.129
But I do think it's sort of the end of my big opera career, meaning for big opera houses, big companies, it's beautiful.

01:33.169 --> 01:34.070
The work is beautiful.

01:34.130 --> 01:39.297
I love designing operas, but the actual schlepping is too difficult.

01:40.138 --> 01:49.249
And so I want to devote my life hereafter, at least partially, to designing for my night kitchen, my own children's theater.

01:49.668 --> 01:52.231
I want to design and write, put on productions.

01:52.331 --> 02:02.084
And since they'll be small, this has to go into the aegis of children's theater, which I don't believe in any more than I believe in children's books.

02:02.725 --> 02:04.427
But I'm stuck with the label.

02:04.767 --> 02:05.708
I'll live with the label.

02:05.788 --> 02:07.531
It's like a harness.

02:07.551 --> 02:09.012
I used to resent it when I was young.

02:09.032 --> 02:10.114
I don't anymore.

02:11.456 --> 02:15.000
But I want to put that energy into a viable...

02:15.942 --> 02:18.746
There are many marvelous children's theaters in America.

02:18.766 --> 02:19.868
I just want to be among them.

02:20.809 --> 02:36.171
And so I'm going to switch from the large monster opera making to the smaller children's theater making with my friends, my partner, Arthur Eurings, and all the people who are working with me in the theater.

02:36.271 --> 02:37.293
That'll be my new life.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.178
Now, where does Knight Kitchen Theater perform?

02:41.198 --> 02:41.999
Where do we see that?

02:42.019 --> 02:43.101
Knight Kitchen will perform.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.865
I have an arrangement now with the Sony Corporation.

02:46.672 --> 02:51.538
And they are opening a building in San Francisco.

02:51.558 --> 02:51.738
Oh, good.

02:51.758 --> 02:58.066
The fourth floor, which will be sort of like what I call personally Mowland.

02:58.807 --> 03:00.429
That's me.

03:01.070 --> 03:02.432
Wild Thing, Night Kitchen.

03:03.413 --> 03:05.375
It is not at all like Disneyland.

03:06.357 --> 03:13.185
It is an extremely original, fairly bizarre display that children will play in.

03:13.891 --> 03:14.772
I've experimented.

03:14.832 --> 03:21.941
We did a smaller version of this in Philadelphia at the museum in Philadelphia.

03:22.442 --> 03:24.304
Please touch museum.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.327
Children's Museum.

03:27.268 --> 03:28.169
No, I'll try it again.

03:28.489 --> 03:29.991
Children's Play Museum.

03:30.692 --> 03:32.855
Well, they actually can come and it's a hands-on thing.

03:33.055 --> 03:36.339
So, of course, everything is wrecked within minutes and they have to reconstruct everything.

03:36.960 --> 03:43.408
And I built an experimental Wild Things place and Night Kitchen place and Jack and Guy place and

03:43.827 --> 03:45.890
It was fantastic.

03:45.910 --> 03:46.792
This is Philly, right?

03:47.513 --> 03:48.154
This is Philly.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.739
And probably the exhibition is still there.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.745
And now the Sony exhibition will be primarily based on that.

03:55.306 --> 03:57.530
So it will have some sort of cottage industry quality.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.673
I don't want high-tech stuff.

03:59.693 --> 04:08.468
But in return for that and my being their fourth floor, they are supporting to a large degree my children's dinner.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.530
And, you know, the arts are dead.

04:11.791 --> 04:14.635
Financing for the arts are dead, rather, in this country.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.358
There is no way.

04:17.079 --> 04:20.043
We couldn't find money, period.

04:20.063 --> 04:21.485
This was the solution to that.

04:21.585 --> 04:26.873
And happily, my relations with Sony are very, very good, since I am artistically in charge of everything.

04:26.953 --> 04:27.594
Oh, that's great.

04:27.895 --> 04:29.157
And they've let me be that.

04:30.258 --> 04:35.586
So our new Children's Theater home will probably be in San Francisco, where the building is going up.

04:36.393 --> 04:37.955
The Yerba Buena Theater.

04:38.035 --> 04:38.656
The Yerba Buena.

04:38.676 --> 04:39.377
The Yerba Buena.

04:39.397 --> 04:42.081
Who would a contact be for me so I could get some information?

04:43.002 --> 04:43.904
Let me think.

04:44.605 --> 04:45.546
Beth Mitchell.

04:46.207 --> 04:47.028
In San Francisco?

04:47.088 --> 04:48.690
No, she's here at Sony in New York.

04:48.710 --> 04:51.294
She's a wonderful person.

04:51.414 --> 04:52.516
I'll have to get her number for you.

04:52.536 --> 04:54.398
Or Ivan can give me... Okay, I'll ask Ivan.

04:55.820 --> 04:56.000
Yeah.

04:56.501 --> 04:57.983
Maybe she can fax me some stuff.

04:58.003 --> 04:59.225
Yeah, no, she's great.

04:59.285 --> 05:01.809
She'll do everything in her power to do that.

05:01.849 --> 05:05.674
Anyway, thus the Children's Theater will be alive with the help of Sony.

05:06.211 --> 05:14.484
And I've done another, doing various jobs to get money for the theater.

05:14.524 --> 05:21.795
We're trying to get corporate help because the old kind of help is over.

05:22.236 --> 05:26.162
You know, we used to be, me and Arthur, like death of a salesman going around with it.

05:26.182 --> 05:27.704
I can't be a Willy Loman anymore.

05:27.724 --> 05:31.329
I just can't ask for money from rich people.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.012
It's a dead issue.

05:34.072 --> 05:39.901
And if major ballet companies and theater companies are closing, you can imagine what's happening to children's theater.

05:39.921 --> 05:45.349
You see, Bill Gates is worth $39 billion, and Ted Turner can't get him to spring something for the poor people.

05:45.369 --> 05:46.491
It's amazing, isn't it?

05:46.511 --> 05:46.771
It's amazing.

05:46.791 --> 05:50.897
I don't want to think about it because it brings up all my murderers here.

05:51.018 --> 05:59.050
So thus, my life will be largely a children's theater, and even more largely, I hope, my own work.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.834
The books I want to do, the results of...

06:02.658 --> 06:14.275
the Shakespeare, learning for the past few years, all the experiences I've had, both sad, tragic, and nice.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.080
And that's how I want my life to be.

06:18.100 --> 06:18.220
Great.

06:19.122 --> 06:23.468
When we chatted briefly on the phone a week or so ago, you mentioned that

06:23.988 --> 06:28.694
I'd love to pick up the spirit of that because there were some excellent things I think we were getting at.

06:29.375 --> 06:35.804
You mentioned how Melville dreaded that in his obituary they would mention only the man who lived with cannibals.

06:36.325 --> 06:38.127
Yeah, and he was right.

06:39.709 --> 06:40.610
That's all they mentioned.

06:41.151 --> 06:47.700
And I feel sorry for him, but I think I'm a little more...

06:48.743 --> 07:17.653
as in doubt or give the determined level but maybe I'm a little more practical I have to be superior in some way I don't care if and my obituary will certainly only mention where the wild things are yes you're convinced of that oh sure I am I know human nature I know the world to a degree I just don't grudge it that it doesn't mean anything

07:17.785 --> 07:20.268
I mean, what does an obituary mean, after all?

07:20.989 --> 07:24.814
I'm sure mine is already written, and I'm sure that's the top line.

07:24.834 --> 07:25.795
That's the lead, right?

07:26.436 --> 07:27.177
And that's fine.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.960
I mean, I know I've done more important books.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.823
I know they're more important to me.

07:31.983 --> 07:32.784
What's more important?

07:33.785 --> 07:39.212
Well, I know In the Night Kitchen, to me, is a better book, simply because it was seven years later.

07:39.252 --> 07:42.756
And I learned a lot from Where the Wild Things Are.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.700
But each book I did...

07:46.355 --> 08:08.736
and I don't say this egotistically, I say it frankly because I've earned it, is that each picture book after that had more substantial weight, qualities, and craftsmanship, and I learned to evolve and sort of make up a children's book.

08:08.756 --> 08:12.460
I think outside over there is better than in the night kitchen.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.923
I'm not talking about... I'm talking about the craft of bookmaking, whether...

08:16.072 --> 08:19.135
People think so or not is beside the point.

08:19.155 --> 08:23.338
But I've been able to use where the wild things are.

08:24.559 --> 08:38.051
Much as Melville used, whether he liked it or not, Typey as his diving board to do a lot of books, it was only when they began to suspect him a lot that that diving board caved in under him.

08:38.071 --> 08:39.753
And Typey couldn't support him anymore.

08:40.413 --> 08:44.577
With Moby Dick, even with Marty, and certainly with Pierre,

08:45.063 --> 08:50.169
He failed his audience because he grew into a genius.

08:50.189 --> 08:53.873
And the 19th century was an interesting genius.

08:53.893 --> 08:59.059
You mentioned those three books in particular, Where the Wild Things Are in the Night Kitchen, Outside Over There.

08:59.079 --> 09:02.222
You've said in the past you consider those a trilogy.

09:02.242 --> 09:02.783
Yes, I do.

09:03.463 --> 09:07.628
And everyone critically doesn't know what I'm talking about.

09:08.603 --> 09:12.748
I think they think I was trying to make it a trio so that they would all sell better.

09:14.610 --> 09:29.286
But to me, they are a trilogy because they are the only, although earlier books like The Sign on Rosie's Door and Even Very Far Away and my first book, Kenny's Window, which is better than a lot of my later books.

09:29.947 --> 09:31.929
But the theme is always the same.

09:31.969 --> 09:36.834
How do children survive a moment circumstance?

09:36.854 --> 09:38.256
How do children survive

09:38.675 --> 09:57.657
the minute their mother's backs are turned, those few seconds where a whole experience occurs, which is imprinted forever, a hurt or a happiness or a colossal anxiety, whatever, and the mother turns, and there's no difference in the look of her child.

09:59.039 --> 10:01.222
For the child, something has happened to the child.

10:01.682 --> 10:04.986
I am impaled with that subject.

10:05.306 --> 10:05.607
Wow.

10:06.107 --> 10:08.310
And whereas the early books were sort of

10:08.628 --> 10:11.852
I didn't know that that's what I was doing, but that's what I was doing.

10:12.553 --> 10:16.137
But the reason why those three are a trilogy is I knew what I was doing.

10:16.597 --> 10:19.020
By that time, I knew what I was doing.

10:19.040 --> 10:34.679
I knew that Where the Wild Things Are is about those few moments where a happy child is totally trusting of his mother and believes that she understands why he's a pain and makes holes in the walls and screams and she tolerates him.

10:34.699 --> 10:37.622
This day, dramatically, she doesn't.

10:38.092 --> 10:39.555
And the shock of the collision.

10:40.698 --> 10:48.334
The shock of the collision and the coming to the resolution that she's frightened him.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.342
He's seen another face.

10:52.362 --> 10:54.226
But in the end, he trusts her.

10:56.591 --> 10:57.433
And he's right to it.

10:58.055 --> 10:58.576
Good question.

10:58.896 --> 11:16.193
The work, without getting into it, because you yourself don't know what will develop from your learning now, but do you expect that when the book that will develop from this Shakespeare and Keats research, would that become one of a quartet, do you think?

11:16.253 --> 11:16.413
No.

11:16.874 --> 11:18.956
No, my subject is finished.

11:18.976 --> 11:20.577
So those three are discrete then?

11:20.597 --> 11:24.662
When I said that, I was another Elizabeth Schwarzkopf statement.

11:24.682 --> 11:27.184
When I said that, I thought it was my last picture book.

11:27.856 --> 11:30.880
Everyone assumed I was going to go into house painting.

11:33.022 --> 11:36.707
All I meant was that subject was finished.

11:36.727 --> 11:44.737
That outside over there was the best manifestation, the best wrought version of the subject.

11:44.757 --> 11:47.480
I had routed out the subject.

11:49.402 --> 11:51.044
It had lived out its life.

11:52.026 --> 11:53.367
There was no more to it.

11:54.849 --> 11:57.272
And Jack and Guy, although it

11:57.792 --> 12:03.980
It is a sub-subject, which is how the children live without parents and society.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.823
But clearly it's on another track.

12:06.844 --> 12:12.951
It's more contemporary, it's political, but it is no longer that subject.

12:13.973 --> 12:14.774
I've worked it through.

12:15.615 --> 12:16.896
That's what you're supposed to do.

12:17.397 --> 12:19.600
And that's what I meant by them being a triptych.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.063
Each one struggled with the subject.

12:23.925 --> 12:26.128
In a funny way, the funniest one...

12:26.969 --> 12:33.916
in the night kitchen is certainly the most frightening one.

12:34.497 --> 12:40.002
Outside over there is always considered the most annoyingly puzzling one.

12:40.022 --> 12:41.644
Like, what the hell is he talking about?

12:43.366 --> 12:46.349
And happily, the kids knew what I was talking about.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.591
And God knows I knew what I was talking about.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.034
And when I was done with that, I was very happy I'd finished.

12:52.154 --> 12:55.278
I was very happy to achieve that book.

12:55.298 --> 12:55.778
So...

12:55.943 --> 13:05.035
The Shakespeare key, new knowledge, new learning, new studying, will hopefully evolve a new book of another.

13:05.255 --> 13:06.737
Perhaps it'll touch on these subjects.

13:06.757 --> 13:07.658
I'm limited.

13:07.698 --> 13:10.462
Thank God Henry James said he wrote the same thing over and over again.

13:11.603 --> 13:12.865
We all do.

13:12.905 --> 13:23.318
I did an interview with Nadine Gordimer, the Nobel Laureate, and she said that for her, writing a novel, it's like she compared it to walking into a room where there's a piece of sculpture.

13:23.652 --> 13:29.677
And every book is like walking around and looking at the same piece from a different angle, a different perspective.

13:30.478 --> 13:35.182
And she says, for me, it's all the same sculpture perceived from different angles.

13:36.103 --> 13:38.125
And I think that's kind of what you're saying in a way.

13:38.165 --> 13:43.330
Yes, the light hits a facet that you didn't notice before.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.932
Certainly that was with The Winter's Tale for me.

13:46.873 --> 13:48.374
Here's a question I didn't ask you.

13:48.434 --> 13:51.717
Do you see your body of work as an oeuvre, as a corpus?

13:52.698 --> 13:53.659
I suppose so.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.823
Oh, that seems so grand of you.

13:58.726 --> 14:05.176
Don't forget I did it in a kind of hustling way, young man making a living in New York.

14:06.237 --> 14:22.701
The guiding spirit was Ursula Nordstrom, who never let me stray far from my subject, who taught me to be devoted and faithful to my subject and not be a macho pig, egotist who felt he had to cover the waterworks.

14:23.643 --> 14:29.991
And every time I did do a book, that strayed because I felt, gee, oh, I wanted to look modern.

14:31.033 --> 14:35.999
I wanted to look Picasso-y, Allen Ginsberg-y.

14:36.660 --> 14:37.461
It didn't work for me.

14:38.823 --> 14:40.966
And then I humbly had to go back to my subject.

14:42.928 --> 14:45.212
Then it seemed humbling.

14:46.353 --> 14:50.899
Now I thank God that I had a guide who led me back.

14:52.027 --> 15:04.018
You know, that wonderful over-quoted statement of Jane Austen, of how she wrote on a tiny piece of ivory, what sounds humbling is not at all.

15:05.599 --> 15:11.864
It's practical because she's such a wonderfully practical woman and full of pride.

15:12.505 --> 15:16.428
Look, look how I filled my little piece of ivory.

15:17.549 --> 15:20.132
Tiny, tiny piece of ivory.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.713
How many of us can say that?

15:22.030 --> 15:22.811
Wonderful.

15:23.031 --> 15:24.253
Yeah.

15:24.273 --> 15:29.319
You know, you mentioned also that you had come across a diary, a journal that you kept.

15:29.379 --> 15:29.760
Yeah.

15:30.461 --> 15:33.965
And you were really excited me with some of the things.

15:34.205 --> 15:39.011
I was 17 and just before my 18th birthday.

15:39.032 --> 15:43.457
And mostly I kept the diary because I so met my brother.

15:43.737 --> 15:46.421
He was in the invasion of the Philippines.

15:46.821 --> 15:47.642
He was in late days.

15:48.483 --> 15:49.725
We didn't hear from him.

15:51.460 --> 15:57.286
My brother-in-law was killed in action, so of course we lived in terror that my brother would be killed in action.

15:57.306 --> 16:01.231
The journal was the only time I ever kept a diary.

16:01.531 --> 16:03.473
I keep a journal now, but it's a work journal.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.716
It's not a personal diary.

16:05.736 --> 16:12.383
But that was very personal, and it sort of kept me going until he came home.

16:13.024 --> 16:17.569
And it ended abruptly when we got a telegram saying, Jack is coming home.

16:17.735 --> 16:18.876
Daniel, how old then?

16:19.377 --> 16:20.378
I was 18.

16:20.478 --> 16:21.700
So you kept it for about a year?

16:21.900 --> 16:26.585
I kept it for about a year, just a little over a year, through my last year of high school.

16:27.486 --> 16:35.595
And I wish I kept it more, and I wish I were a better journalist, because, wow, I had a big fight with Mama.

16:35.635 --> 16:36.537
Now I'm sorry.

16:37.438 --> 16:41.302
Gee, why didn't I tell what the fight was about?

16:41.322 --> 16:43.084
I can't remember those things.

16:43.722 --> 16:47.767
I didn't write a very... But the mood of it is very World War II.

16:49.470 --> 17:12.480
The sense of my parents suffering, the Holocaust, what's happening in Europe, the dread of being drafted, that when I graduated high school I would be drafted, that I wouldn't be home when my brother came home, that I'd go in the army, that my parents would... another son would go, how could they survive?

17:13.102 --> 17:15.445
with all the dead relatives and now their sons.

17:16.006 --> 17:17.087
It was filled with anxiety.

17:17.508 --> 17:19.690
It was just total anxiety.

17:20.612 --> 17:25.778
And also, I was such a neurotic boy, and I hated school with such a passion.

17:26.800 --> 17:34.269
I became physically ill, and every opening is, I'm sick, I'll throw up, I can't say school today.

17:35.231 --> 17:40.257
I mentioned teachers who were wonderful to me, but who I didn't trust.

17:40.895 --> 17:46.120
This is Warshaw, my English teacher, in order to get me to read Shakespeare.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.283
I was intelligent, but I wouldn't read.

17:49.463 --> 17:50.404
I wouldn't do homework.

17:51.685 --> 17:52.426
Who can explain?

17:52.486 --> 17:53.447
Dyslexia?

17:54.748 --> 17:55.849
Neurosis?

17:55.869 --> 17:56.270
Who knows?

17:57.671 --> 18:02.756
And she had to illustrate Macbeth for her so that I would get to read it.

18:02.776 --> 18:05.419
She knew to get me through pictures.

18:05.479 --> 18:07.881
And I worked as hard then as I do now.

18:09.076 --> 18:11.198
You know, I made projects for myself.

18:11.738 --> 18:16.283
Today I am beginning The Lux of Roaring Camp by Bret Hart.

18:17.384 --> 18:20.506
I hope to finish it in a month's time.

18:20.526 --> 18:21.387
That's not a deadline.

18:22.348 --> 18:23.849
And I did not socialize.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.010
I didn't go out on dates.

18:26.632 --> 18:28.093
I didn't do what other kids did.

18:28.313 --> 18:29.354
I fought people off.

18:30.415 --> 18:31.857
I mentioned phone calls from friends.

18:32.317 --> 18:35.140
Thank God I was able to talk myself out of that one.

18:36.301 --> 18:37.682
Why didn't I go out?

18:38.607 --> 18:39.708
Why didn't I enjoy myself?

18:39.969 --> 18:44.273
But did you say that you thought you saw the same person that you are today?

18:44.474 --> 18:44.754
I am.

18:44.794 --> 18:48.938
Except, yes, I am the same person.

18:49.199 --> 18:51.301
I think the nervous system was all formed already.

18:52.122 --> 18:54.044
I was a workaholic.

18:54.064 --> 18:56.707
My parents worried about why I was indoors all the time.

18:56.747 --> 18:59.911
These self-imposed projects, I took very seriously.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.033
The publisher had ordered them.

19:02.823 --> 19:05.247
I illustrated The Happy Prince by Oscar Wilde.

19:05.347 --> 19:08.011
I illustrated The Luck of Roaring Camp by Bret Hart.

19:08.091 --> 19:10.674
I illustrated The Opera Louise by Charpentier.

19:11.856 --> 19:14.981
I illustrated The Match Girl by Hans Christian Andersen.

19:15.001 --> 19:17.805
At what age is your young, your kid?

19:17.965 --> 19:21.170
I was between 16 and 17 on all these projects.

19:22.532 --> 19:28.641
They're not good, but they're heartfelt, especially the Bret Hart.

19:29.642 --> 19:31.024
They're heartfelt.

19:31.831 --> 19:36.315
And you can see the clumsy influence of Disney and the clumsy influence of movies.

19:36.395 --> 19:41.080
And I was thinking, gee, a Renaissance kid and Michelangelo is working across the street.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.302
My early books would have looked better.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.806
All I had was Mickey Mouse and the movies.

19:47.826 --> 19:49.688
So you make do with what you got.

19:50.028 --> 19:51.710
Tell me, do you still take the afternoon nap?

19:52.171 --> 19:52.811
Yeah.

19:52.971 --> 19:53.952
Oh, yeah.

19:53.972 --> 19:56.415
That was started with my coronary.

19:56.815 --> 19:58.316
Oh, I love it.

19:58.336 --> 19:59.478
I do myself, by the way.

19:59.678 --> 19:59.998
How do you...

20:00.721 --> 20:03.386
It's to me, and I can sleep anywhere, you know.

20:04.067 --> 20:05.870
The only thing I can't do is sleep standing up.

20:06.231 --> 20:12.983
Yeah, when I'm in an office meeting on 5th, they say, excuse me, can I use your floor or your couch or your tabletop?

20:13.784 --> 20:19.995
And when I skip it, and I do sometimes, I can barely get through the evening.

20:20.093 --> 20:20.754
Yeah.

20:20.774 --> 20:25.020
No, I need one, and I'm blessed that I can take them on a second's notice.

20:25.561 --> 20:30.908
Now, how about, I mean, I hate to bring up a subject, but I didn't notice any puppy, any dogs when I was there.

20:30.928 --> 20:31.409
They're all dead.

20:31.629 --> 20:32.290
They're all gone.

20:32.470 --> 20:43.325
And last, but I must admit, my favorite, his name was Runga, after Philip Otto Runga, the German romantic painter.

20:44.287 --> 20:44.928
How do you spell?

20:44.948 --> 20:48.372
Copiously stolen from R-U-N-G-E.

20:49.454 --> 20:49.594
Mm-hmm.

20:49.709 --> 20:53.655
I'll check it out.

20:54.416 --> 20:54.596
Yeah.

20:55.678 --> 21:03.168
Outside over there is homage, that's a kind word, to Philip Otto Runge, and I named my dog after him.

21:03.829 --> 21:12.922
And Runge is in outside over there, and he died a year and a half ago.

21:12.942 --> 21:13.964
German Shepherd.

21:15.265 --> 21:16.908
And I can't get over it.

21:17.428 --> 21:17.689
Really?

21:17.709 --> 21:17.809
Yeah.

21:18.008 --> 21:21.572
Oh, my brother two years ago, and then a few months later, Runga.

21:21.712 --> 21:24.174
Those are the two major support systems.

21:24.194 --> 21:28.359
Yeah, we've got an eight-year-old lab who's diabetic.

21:28.379 --> 21:29.740
We give her two shots a day.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.681
She's arthritic.

21:31.302 --> 21:34.865
And you worry about them like a child.

21:35.446 --> 21:36.447
I know.

21:36.467 --> 21:41.472
And that's why I'm holding off, because I'm getting to be a coward at my old age.

21:42.293 --> 21:45.496
So I can emotionally cope as well.

21:45.957 --> 21:46.277
See...

21:46.628 --> 21:49.174
I took Runger to the vet to put him to sleep.

21:49.254 --> 21:50.337
I took all my dogs.

21:50.457 --> 21:51.219
I had four dogs here.

21:52.642 --> 21:54.085
Each dog didn't die.

21:54.747 --> 21:59.298
I had to take them to the vet, cradle them, watch them die, which was quite beautiful.

21:59.678 --> 22:00.280
I was complaining.

22:00.921 --> 22:05.532
But I vowed that the next dog I would give driving lessons to.

22:05.748 --> 22:09.952
and he or she would drive me to the vet.

22:09.972 --> 22:13.236
Let's point out... If I can guarantee that, I would get another dog.

22:13.256 --> 22:17.780
You brought these dogs when they were hopelessly ill, and I think we should... Oh, yes.

22:18.581 --> 22:19.082
Obviously.

22:19.182 --> 22:20.703
I didn't say, well, they were healthy.

22:20.723 --> 22:22.986
No, no, I mean, but I'm saying that... No, no, no.

22:23.006 --> 22:24.127
Runga had cancer.

22:24.147 --> 22:24.627
Yeah.

22:25.128 --> 22:29.352
And the vet left it up to me to win the symptoms.

22:29.372 --> 22:31.514
He was very, very well cared for.

22:31.935 --> 22:32.415
Yeah.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.198
And only on the morning when he looked disoriented...

22:35.515 --> 22:37.857
and went out and fell over on his thigh.

22:37.997 --> 22:40.820
That's heartbreaking, yeah.

22:41.761 --> 22:49.307
My dog, who I still have images of running at the beach after seagulls, now she can barely hold herself up in her hind quarters.

22:49.327 --> 22:52.510
I see that and it's so painful and you have to judge.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.913
You know, imagine, could we do that for each other?

22:56.153 --> 23:00.377
Yeah, well, she's not incontinent yet, so we give her the aspirin and she feels good.

23:00.817 --> 23:03.580
Yeah, and as long as that goes, then you play it by ear.

23:03.600 --> 23:03.700
Yeah.

23:05.165 --> 23:07.628
One other question, and it's totally up to you.

23:07.688 --> 23:15.416
I have to tell you how moved I was when you took me into your office and you touched that face of Keats.

23:15.436 --> 23:20.782
By the way, Helen Vendler has a life mask of Keats.

23:20.822 --> 23:26.448
When I told her that you have a death mask, she says, I would love to talk to him.

23:26.848 --> 23:28.810
You will have a common point.

23:29.093 --> 23:30.715
I can't wait to talk to her.

23:30.735 --> 23:31.816
Yeah, and I'll set that.

23:31.836 --> 23:37.982
When we both come back from our trips, and I'm seeing her when I come back... And I'm home on the 26th of October.

23:38.002 --> 23:41.666
Okay, and I'll be... So I'll... She's where?

23:41.766 --> 23:42.346
I'm sorry.

23:43.207 --> 23:44.068
She's in Cambridge.

23:44.268 --> 23:44.589
Cambridge.

23:45.149 --> 23:46.130
She teaches at Harvard.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.312
She's a full professor there, and she lives there.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.333
I still visit her.

23:50.455 --> 23:50.855
Why not?

23:51.115 --> 23:53.418
I haven't been there in such a long time.

23:54.018 --> 23:58.643
I'll be in New York in November because Hansel is coming to Juilliard Christmas.

23:58.663 --> 23:58.763
Yeah.

23:59.738 --> 24:00.539
I'll figure it out.

24:00.559 --> 24:00.939
Yeah, good.

24:01.240 --> 24:06.606
But you must, and forgive me for saying this, but you must promise to put us together when I get home.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.569
I vow it.

24:08.969 --> 24:09.069
Okay.

24:09.089 --> 24:10.371
Now, one quick question.

24:10.411 --> 24:14.156
I was so touched when you showed me that Keats mask.

24:14.176 --> 24:16.378
Is this something I can use in this story or not?

24:16.398 --> 24:17.440
I think not.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.241
Okay.

24:18.441 --> 24:20.323
It's intensely private.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.367
My showing it to you was

24:24.258 --> 24:26.060
How good I felt during our discussion.

24:26.080 --> 24:26.180
Good.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.121
Then let's just leave it there.

24:27.262 --> 24:28.083
Yeah, I can't.

24:28.343 --> 24:28.844
Okay.

24:28.864 --> 24:30.826
It sounds so different when you talk about it.

24:30.846 --> 24:33.289
I know.

24:33.309 --> 24:35.652
I know the magic that was going on.

24:36.252 --> 24:37.834
And he trusts me.

24:37.894 --> 24:44.983
That little deadhead trusts me not to profit emotionally from him.

24:45.453 --> 24:47.379
And I'm not going to do that.

24:47.399 --> 24:47.680
Okay.

24:48.222 --> 24:48.663
Guess what?

24:49.405 --> 24:50.148
End of subjects.

24:50.168 --> 24:50.850
Okay.

24:50.870 --> 24:51.171
Okay?

24:51.973 --> 24:52.936
You have a safe trip.

24:53.197 --> 24:53.538
Thank you.

24:53.558 --> 24:54.140
You have a safe trip.

24:54.421 --> 24:55.043
And we'll talk.

24:55.885 --> 24:56.267
Thank you.

24:56.568 --> 24:57.009
Thank you.

24:57.029 --> 24:57.129
Okay.

24:57.210 --> 24:57.370
Bye-bye.
