00:02.039 --> 00:06.446
This armor is an excellent one.

00:06.667 --> 00:08.249
It is complete.

00:08.971 --> 00:17.364
It belonged to the Admiral of Castile, Enrique's family, and it was a Milanese make.

00:17.885 --> 00:27.962
And the analogy is that even in those days the Italians were great fabric makers, armor makers, weapons makers.

00:28.229 --> 00:32.996
quality that you see in these armors is now reflected in their fashion.

00:33.357 --> 00:34.418
They're people of taste.

00:36.081 --> 00:44.754
So this really wasn't constructed for function as much as... No, no, it was constructed for function, but it's decorated beautifully.

00:45.435 --> 00:52.245
And that was this armor of the 17th century where armor was beginning to be eliminated.

00:52.495 --> 00:54.538
But the nobles still had them.

00:54.558 --> 00:57.843
Once the guns came in, these things were necessary.

00:58.023 --> 00:59.225
Yeah, true.

01:00.247 --> 01:01.609
I mean, these were for arrows, I guess.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.911
Okay, I'm going to shoot a few pictures.

01:03.391 --> 01:05.935
Where can I put this cigar so I don't want to?

01:05.955 --> 01:06.456
Wait here.

01:07.237 --> 01:07.798
You don't mind?

01:08.018 --> 01:10.322
Not at all.

01:10.342 --> 01:13.346
It's so great to meet somebody who loves a good cigar.

01:16.271 --> 01:21.118
Do you notice that the men of that period were not very tall?

01:21.655 --> 01:27.280
But you have to carry seventy-five pounds on them, see.

01:27.300 --> 01:31.545
You can leave.

01:31.565 --> 01:32.586
There it is.

01:32.786 --> 01:34.307
Okay.

01:34.327 --> 01:35.388
I'm really embarrassed.

01:35.408 --> 01:36.489
What's wrong with my lens?

01:37.230 --> 01:43.716
Maybe I was on the train too long today, huh?

01:43.736 --> 01:46.859
There it is.

01:46.879 --> 01:49.882
There it is.

01:49.902 --> 01:50.443
It didn't work.

01:51.024 --> 01:51.544
It didn't work?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.894
This is a night bomb.

01:54.294 --> 01:55.215
It's never failed.

01:55.235 --> 02:01.480
What in the world just happens here?

02:01.901 --> 02:06.345
I need about two seconds to collect myself.

02:15.813 --> 02:18.055
What is Murphy's Law?

02:18.075 --> 02:19.836
Yeah.

02:20.237 --> 02:20.637
Firearms.

02:21.443 --> 02:23.185
They love beautiful things, I guess.

02:23.245 --> 02:23.665
Beautiful things.

02:24.566 --> 02:29.210
And what is it about old, old things that... Well, they'll never be done again.

02:29.270 --> 02:34.255
They will never be the artisans that made them.

02:35.276 --> 02:39.820
And everything is very cheap today.

02:39.860 --> 02:44.204
When you go to Mexico, for instance, you don't find the treasure of the Aztecs there.

02:44.224 --> 02:48.649
You find some stuff that you see at the airports.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.231
And this is all armor here.

02:51.869 --> 02:55.703
So I'll call Dale and I'm sure she'll be able to get me some.
