00:02.680 --> 00:18.360
Now, William Lyon Phelps was one of the most important teachers, professors at Yale University throughout his career.

00:19.782 --> 00:29.734
Phelps's first class at Yale was in 1892 when he lectured to all the freshmen about the beauties and the glories of English lit in Shakespeare, and he made his entire career here.

00:30.220 --> 00:49.786
and died in the 1930s, and he lived, you drove, no, you didn't quite drive by his house near the corner, but in any case, he became a very popular lecturer coast to coast on the beauties of lift and browning and stuff like this, and this is his autobiography, but he does tell in there of Alexander Cochran, whose portrait is out in there.

00:50.627 --> 00:59.299
Now, Alexander Smith Cochran came from a family in Yonkers, New York, that had the Cochran carpet works, and at a time when there was no income tax, they had a

00:59.633 --> 01:04.281
family business and had 1,200 employees, and they had lots of lovely money.

01:05.002 --> 01:19.465
And Alex Cochran was a freshman in Billy Peltz's class in 1892, and so he graduated in the class of 1896, which is remarkable for Yale because of the number of people in that class who did something significant to the university.

01:20.035 --> 01:21.738
That's of 96.

01:21.898 --> 01:22.939
Yeah, but that's a sidelight.

01:22.959 --> 01:23.881
Cochran was one.

01:24.041 --> 01:26.705
Anson Stokes, who was secretary of the university, was another.

01:26.885 --> 01:27.847
Sidelights are good, though.

01:28.247 --> 01:28.648
Yeah.

01:29.209 --> 01:32.434
You know, there was a little sort of luncheon club of sons of the class of 96.

01:32.854 --> 01:37.301
Even the sons of 96 are dead now, but, you know, I knew most of them.

01:37.321 --> 01:41.668
A longtime secretary of the university, George Vail, was another son of 96.

01:41.728 --> 01:44.011
So it was an interesting class.

01:44.031 --> 01:48.658
In any case, Cochran was a yachtsman.

01:49.499 --> 02:00.211
And he traveled a lot, and long about 1910 or 11, he wrote to Phelps and said, you know, this typical thing, you won't remember me, but I was in your class in such and such.

02:00.611 --> 02:04.716
Phelps, you can imagine, didn't remember him, but wrote back saying, yes, of course, dear boy.

02:05.176 --> 02:06.017
And so forth.

02:06.157 --> 02:10.842
And Cochran said, I was inspired to collect some books, and I'd like to send you a list of them.

02:11.083 --> 02:11.523
And he did.

02:11.563 --> 02:18.831
And essentially what Cochran said was that when he was an undergraduate, the

02:19.115 --> 02:24.383
Junior members and senior members of the university did not interact very much, except in the classroom.

02:24.784 --> 02:32.535
And he was accustomed to being in the classroom when Professor So-and-So would come in and take off his top hat and put it down and talk at him for an hour, and then put his hat on and leave.

02:33.557 --> 02:37.883
And undergraduates had their fraternities in their drinking places, and particularly the grown-ups had theirs.

02:38.524 --> 02:47.097
But what Cochrane had was the notion of founding a more or less serious-minded club

02:47.482 --> 02:51.968
where people, junior and senior members, could come together and talk.

02:51.988 --> 02:57.776
And he wanted to form this club and give his collection of books as a nucleus of it.

02:57.796 --> 02:59.779
For my typist, did you just spell Cochran's name?

02:59.999 --> 03:02.443
It's Cochran, C-O-C-H-R-A-N.

03:02.823 --> 03:03.023
Thank you.

03:03.945 --> 03:10.814
And Phelps, of course, thought this was a capital idea, and he went to the president of the university with this notion.

03:10.874 --> 03:14.199
And Cochran's willing to buy the house and get the club going and everything.

03:14.219 --> 03:15.801
And the president of the university has

03:16.220 --> 03:22.989
all presidents of universities then and now would say was, well, we do need a new dormitory at the Trinity School.

03:23.390 --> 03:24.471
Wouldn't he rather do that?

03:25.613 --> 03:33.243
And Cochrane demurred and Columbia University, I've always been told, third with the notion of getting his collection.

03:33.764 --> 03:38.891
But in any case, he went back to Phelps and said, look, let's go ahead and do this.

03:39.532 --> 03:40.353
You find a house.

03:40.453 --> 03:41.174
I'll pay for it.

03:41.294 --> 03:42.176
I'll give you an endowment.

03:42.196 --> 03:42.997
We'll get it started.

03:44.018 --> 03:46.041
That's a great story.

03:47.236 --> 03:48.839
The original is the members of the club.

03:48.879 --> 03:49.920
So they bought this house.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.466
Cochrane gave us the original endowment, which at that time was $100,000.

03:54.648 --> 03:56.030
Here is the endowment of the original.

03:56.050 --> 03:58.894
There's an honorary family, alumni, and undergraduate members.

03:59.595 --> 04:03.301
Now you see, here, this is 1911.

04:03.942 --> 04:06.206
Arthur Twining Hadley was president of the university.

04:06.226 --> 04:09.090
Arthur Twining Hadley, H-A-D-L-E-Y.

04:09.611 --> 04:13.918
And Anson Stokes, in 96 again, became secretary of the university.

04:14.472 --> 04:15.773
Lonsbury was a professor.

04:15.894 --> 04:17.095
Baker was a professor.

04:19.538 --> 04:20.919
Beverly Chew, New York City.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.341
Oh, I just brought his camera up.

04:22.381 --> 04:23.662
Theodore Lowe-DeVinney, New York City.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.725
William Augustus White, New York City.

04:25.745 --> 04:27.266
Those are all Groyer Club in time.

04:27.587 --> 04:30.390
George Plimpton, William Loring Andrews, and so forth.

04:31.171 --> 04:37.718
DeVinney and Chew were two of the seven founding members of the Groyer Club.

04:37.738 --> 04:39.721
And, you know, these are some of the others.

04:39.761 --> 04:41.863
Look, look at how big the class of 98.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.194
Sixes, you see.

04:43.214 --> 04:44.715
There's Alex Cochran, the founder.

04:45.316 --> 04:48.158
Clarence Day, the author of Life with Fathers in that class.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.220
George Nettleton.

04:50.781 --> 04:51.702
I know his daughter.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.083
I went to there on Sunday.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.346
Johnny Burdan was a great person in English.

04:56.366 --> 04:56.927
B-E-I-D-A-N.

04:57.467 --> 04:58.328
Yes.

04:58.348 --> 05:02.892
In any case, this is the club as it was founded in 1911.

05:03.012 --> 05:09.218
And for the next few years, there were a number of

05:09.468 --> 05:15.016
Provenance collectors, Mr. Folger, Mr. Frick, and so forth, Mr. White, others, who gave us books.

05:15.237 --> 05:22.708
I mean, when you look in that catalog, you can look under Provenance, and you will see somewhere there is a book inscribed by Folger to the club and so forth.

05:22.728 --> 05:26.194
So there are a lot of these nice sort of collector's compliments.

05:26.214 --> 05:27.716
What distinguishes this club?

05:27.816 --> 05:33.505
I hesitate to say what makes it unique, but... Well, what makes it unique is... So there is a uniqueness to it.

05:33.525 --> 05:33.765
Okay.

05:33.825 --> 05:36.910
Well, A, none of such organizations exists anyplace else.

05:37.244 --> 05:40.989
But the uniqueness of it is that it brings together junior and senior members of the university.

05:41.009 --> 05:42.431
This is an undergraduate club.

05:42.851 --> 05:45.715
The fact that there are $20 million worth of books here is beside the point.

05:46.396 --> 05:52.003
The fact is that seven days a week during term time, this place is full of people having cups of tea and sandwiches.

05:52.463 --> 05:54.346
The sandwiches haven't changed for 30 years.

05:54.386 --> 06:00.113
There's always tomato on Monday and cucumber on Tuesday and chicken salad on Wednesday, cinnamon toast on Thursday, tuna on Friday.

06:00.481 --> 06:02.944
date nut bread on Saturday and peanut butter on Sunday.

06:03.204 --> 06:04.025
Get that in there.

06:04.045 --> 06:04.445
All right.

06:04.685 --> 06:08.609
But in any case, this hasn't changed for years, and there are always cookies and iced tea this time of the year.

06:08.950 --> 06:14.295
There's a lawn in back where people play croquet, and we occasionally challenge the Signet Society at Harvard to a croquet match.

06:15.136 --> 06:16.518
But in any case, there it is.

06:16.838 --> 06:19.721
There are people of all ages talking.

06:20.021 --> 06:26.328
And on Fridays, I or one of the other members of the library committee is here to open up this vault.

06:26.348 --> 06:27.169
So it is open?

06:27.850 --> 06:30.252
Oh, every week for an hour on Friday afternoon.

06:30.637 --> 06:38.144
Now, any scholar who comes and wants to look at a book lets us know in advance, and I take it over to the Beinecke, and they can sit down and study it.

06:38.745 --> 06:40.386
So it is brought from here to the Beinecke.

06:40.747 --> 06:44.230
But otherwise, the vault is open, and I'm showing it to people on a Friday afternoon.

06:44.250 --> 06:44.811
Oh, boy.

06:45.291 --> 06:53.359
Now, the really astonishing thing, he was interested in Shakespeare, Cochrane, was interested in Shakespeare and early English literature.

06:54.480 --> 06:59.665
And so what we have here is Shakespeare and his sources, the historical sources,

06:59.999 --> 07:05.846
Pliny, Plutarch, Florio's Montaigne, the things that Shakespeare would have read and used and known about.

07:05.886 --> 07:10.912
And we have Shakespeare's works, and we have other highlights, high spots of English literature.

07:10.992 --> 07:15.136
We have a first, first, second, third, and fourth, all relevant.

07:15.236 --> 07:16.798
That's a $2 million book in itself.

07:16.818 --> 07:17.519
Which one, the first?

07:17.539 --> 07:17.960
The first.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.261
What breaks into $2 million?

07:19.281 --> 07:20.322
Is it the original binding?

07:21.143 --> 07:27.070
It's one of the finest copies of the book, with a provenance of seven or eight names going back in the middle of the

07:27.370 --> 07:28.412
18th century.

07:28.432 --> 07:30.254
I will put my pen away.

07:30.335 --> 07:35.442
And binding by, we think, I think the Robert Mears, I'm not sure.

07:35.783 --> 07:39.609
In any case, the thing is, what makes it a $2 million book is... Can I touch it?

07:39.769 --> 07:47.200
Yeah, thanks to the Bradley Martin copy and other things that have been sold lately, that establishes the value of buying copies of this book on that level.

07:48.162 --> 07:52.729
But in any case, the important thing... It wasn't the Bradley Martin, it was the guidance.

07:52.749 --> 07:53.810
You're absolutely right.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.032
Yes, you're right.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.788
That was the four folios that sold as one lot, I think, 2.1.

07:59.888 --> 08:00.409
That's right.

08:00.609 --> 08:01.591
And then there was another.

08:01.651 --> 08:08.944
There were several other sales of some of the others, and by subtraction, we had to send that away.

08:09.004 --> 08:13.392
But I saw their first folio, and it doesn't approach that.

08:13.412 --> 08:15.576
Is that right?

08:16.057 --> 08:17.960
Well, that binding is pretty extraordinary.

08:18.000 --> 08:18.220
It is.

08:18.962 --> 08:19.703
I can just...

08:20.577 --> 08:25.324
Well, this was described in— Their binding is a lot like this one for their first— Oh, that's very ordinary.

08:25.484 --> 08:25.765
Yeah.

08:25.905 --> 08:31.093
Now, this copy was described in an early sale catalog in an amusing kind of way.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.378
It's in the catalog, so I'll let me tell them.

08:35.539 --> 08:35.640
Yeah.

08:35.660 --> 08:41.088
This copy from the libraries of Mr. Herbert and Mr. Wicks is one of the finest copies known, but I've had the finest ever come to public auction.

08:41.108 --> 08:42.069
Don't translate this.

08:42.510 --> 08:43.812
In any case, the Huth copy.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.536
Now, the Huth sale came up in 1911.

08:47.037 --> 08:47.558
H-U-T-H.

08:48.920 --> 08:49.200
And—

08:50.210 --> 08:55.036
Cochrane bought from the Hughes catalog, in one block, 40 Shakespeare quartos.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.317
Oh, those quartos.

08:57.318 --> 09:01.323
And, uh, the thing is this.

09:01.383 --> 09:04.767
Here is Lucrece with the Hughes bookplate, 1594.

09:05.308 --> 09:06.209
How many copies are these?

09:06.589 --> 09:06.970
Three or four?

09:06.990 --> 09:08.852
There are two or three, and this is the finest.

09:08.912 --> 09:10.674
L-U-C-R-E-C-E, 1594.

09:10.774 --> 09:15.520
May I just put this down and just touch it?

09:15.540 --> 09:16.040
I'm sorry.

09:17.502 --> 09:19.204
Part of this quest has been...

09:20.197 --> 09:22.159
Oh, my goodness.

09:22.359 --> 09:23.400
The Rape of Lucrece.

09:26.242 --> 09:27.643
This is an extraordinary copy.

09:27.683 --> 09:29.005
Now, what's the provenance of this?

09:29.925 --> 09:31.106
You see the Huth book right?

09:31.587 --> 09:32.227
You'll have to look.

09:33.529 --> 09:38.333
There's the Huth book right there.

09:38.353 --> 09:41.135
Oh, my.

09:41.155 --> 09:41.556
Okay.

09:41.956 --> 09:50.203
In any case, one of the unusual things about the Huth book, the Huth collection had

09:50.791 --> 09:56.239
the single perfect copy known of the Richard the Third Quarter.

09:56.259 --> 10:00.826
And the only thing that Richard the Third Quarter was known were a couple of proof sheets that were in the British Museum.

10:01.947 --> 10:11.141
And so the perfect quarto was exchanged with the British Museum for their proof sheets, which were exchanged and given to us.

10:12.844 --> 10:14.867
You see stamped British Museum duplicates.

10:15.808 --> 10:19.393
Apart from the perfect quarto and the BM, these proof sheets are the only thing that exists.

10:19.573 --> 10:19.954
Wow.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.424
Now, who struck the deal with the British Museum?

10:24.585 --> 10:27.811
Presumably, the executive director of Hughes Estate and Mr. Cochran.

10:27.831 --> 10:29.473
So they are the perfect one, and we have this.

10:31.036 --> 10:33.860
Among the books, I said that .

10:33.880 --> 10:33.961
.

10:33.981 --> 10:34.141
.

10:34.161 --> 10:36.364
Did both benefit from that deal, would you say?

10:36.505 --> 10:38.648
I would say that probably .

10:38.668 --> 10:38.788
.

10:38.808 --> 10:38.908
.

10:39.790 --> 10:40.531
Yes, I know.

10:40.571 --> 10:43.376
How often do you see British Museum duplicate in a book?

10:43.436 --> 10:43.897
I understand.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.701
Is anything as rare as that?

10:47.204 --> 10:51.370
This book is a particular... What I'm trying to say is, who got the better of the deal, do you think?

10:51.450 --> 10:53.713
The British Library or...?

10:53.733 --> 10:57.859
Well, I mean, they have the complete one, you know, the unique complete one, and that would be the better end of the deal, I suppose.

10:57.919 --> 10:59.401
And it's where it belongs, too.

10:59.421 --> 11:00.102
It's where it belongs.

11:00.122 --> 11:03.646
It's amusing for us to have the duplicate stand.

11:03.666 --> 11:05.088
Now, this is interesting.

11:05.108 --> 11:15.102
This is one of the huge books, and it's interesting as a document in the history of book collecting, because this is the 1599, the bad quarter over in the M. Juliet, which was...

11:16.617 --> 11:20.921
used for performance in Mark Tubb.

11:20.941 --> 11:28.467
It had its early owner, who wrote her anagram, Elizabeth Rotten, her lot is to be neat.

11:29.468 --> 11:30.689
R-O-T-T-O-N.

11:30.889 --> 11:31.910
Is that right?

11:31.990 --> 11:35.213
Elizabeth with an S-E-L-I-S-A-P-E-T-H.

11:36.153 --> 11:46.422
In any case, this shows at the beginning, this is just a little booklet, just a little pamphlet, just a little piece of printed ephemera,

11:46.722 --> 11:51.989
marked up for performance, divided into acts and scenes, playing music, and so on.

11:53.792 --> 11:59.159
In the 18th century, there had been, from 1623 to 1685, four folios.

11:59.860 --> 12:03.104
And that was the book, that was the edition that would be in any gentleman's library.

12:03.685 --> 12:08.692
But by the beginning of the 18th century, Shakespeare was sufficiently old-fashioned, he needed to be explained and edited.

12:09.073 --> 12:12.257
And there were nine principal editors of Shakespeare in the 18th century.

12:12.473 --> 12:15.997
starting with Roe in 1709 and ending with Malone.

12:16.538 --> 12:30.133
In any case, this one by one in the 18th century, scholars pointed out the value of these little pamphlets as toolbox, as evidence for the text, and this then was the property of George Stevens, the editor.

12:30.313 --> 12:31.975
Now, Stevens went through this.

12:32.095 --> 12:33.857
Whose annotations are these again, would you say?

12:33.897 --> 12:38.903
Well, I'm about to show you Stevens's, because Stevens is perfectly clear collated this,

12:39.406 --> 12:48.717
and with the earlier quartile, perhaps, or with the folio, and made little corrections like that.

12:48.877 --> 12:51.781
You see, there's a speech of Romeo that he's corrected to Juliet.

12:54.944 --> 12:58.348
You see little marks in this, too, you see, like that.

12:59.089 --> 13:07.219
But in any case, once someone like Stevens pointed out the value of this thing for textual evidence, then it was worthy of being in the library the Duke of Roxburgh.

13:07.604 --> 13:13.032
And the Roxburgh sale, as you know, in 1810, 11, was the most famous sale in the whole aisles of New York.

13:13.052 --> 13:16.077
The Roxburgh Club has now named it.

13:16.558 --> 13:16.858
Exactly.

13:16.878 --> 13:19.182
But after Roxburgh, it belonged... That is the seal, right?

13:19.222 --> 13:19.642
That's the seal.

13:19.662 --> 13:25.772
It belonged to... Is that embossed, or is that... That's just a rubber stamp or a wood stamp or something.

13:25.792 --> 13:30.539
But George Daniel, wealthy collector of the 19th century, had it bound up this way.

13:31.340 --> 13:36.548
And so what I like to show people is...

13:36.865 --> 13:45.255
This quarto of 1610, which is immaculate, priced, stitched, as issued, completely unpressed.

13:45.275 --> 13:46.557
I mean, it's just absolutely wonderful.

13:47.237 --> 13:50.661
But this is what... Oh my God, that page looked like it just came off the press, didn't it?

13:50.682 --> 13:52.784
This is what the Shakespeare would have looked like originally.

13:52.844 --> 14:01.995
But you see, one by one, these 19th century collectors got hold of these quartoes and sent them off to Riviere and Sangorski and had them bound up like this.

14:02.566 --> 14:04.509
How do you feel about that?

14:04.629 --> 14:06.251
Would you rather have them in their original life?

14:06.271 --> 14:07.213
It's just a historical fact.

14:07.273 --> 14:10.738
Of course, as a bibliographer and a scholar, you can learn more from books like that.

14:11.179 --> 14:16.967
But in any case, this one little book embodies the whole history of the collecting of early English literature.

14:17.007 --> 14:17.488
This book.

14:17.708 --> 14:23.777
Because it was put on the map in 1811 by the Roxburgh sale when a lot of books made high prices.

14:24.518 --> 14:30.126
And it was basically over by 1911 when the youth sale.

14:30.562 --> 14:32.525
when Cochrane bought all of these 40 quartos.

14:32.965 --> 14:34.347
Is that the title of this book once again?

14:34.367 --> 14:36.770
This is the Romeo and Juliet, 1599.

14:37.732 --> 14:48.566
But today, you know, in our lifetime, that set of folios that you saw in the garden sale was almost a unique opportunity to buy it.

14:48.927 --> 14:52.532
These quartos, you know, one or two, and Cochrane was able to buy 40 at once.

14:52.952 --> 14:58.460
So for that hundred years in the 19th century, you could collect this early English literature.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.421
We also have

15:00.515 --> 15:01.536
in the library here.

15:01.716 --> 15:05.461
How would this collection of quartos compare to the Huntington collection of quartos?

15:05.481 --> 15:06.542
I honestly can't say.

15:07.403 --> 15:07.803
I don't know.

15:07.984 --> 15:09.665
But it's certainly competitive.

15:09.705 --> 15:12.128
Well, we're one of the top libraries for these things.

15:12.188 --> 15:16.473
But, you know, the Folger Library has 79 of those first folios, and we have one.

15:16.493 --> 15:17.114
Yeah, that's folios.

15:17.154 --> 15:20.458
But quartos, I think, are much more difficult to get than folios.

15:20.498 --> 15:21.179
We all know that.

15:22.780 --> 15:23.862
That's a knockout.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.984
So I wouldn't know how to make that assessment.

15:26.004 --> 15:28.547
But, you know, so we've got these other things.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.822
Chapman's Homer, and there's Paradise Lost.

15:30.842 --> 15:31.843
Where's Chapman's Homer?

15:31.863 --> 15:32.604
All these things.

15:36.649 --> 15:43.516
You know what's really extraordinary is that it's here, in this room and not across the street.

15:46.940 --> 15:47.420
There it is.

15:47.761 --> 15:55.429
There's Chapman's Homer, which in 1801 was calculated to be 203 years old, and someone wrote on the

15:55.713 --> 15:58.076
And time is old, as I have been told.

15:58.116 --> 16:05.727
But now in days, as most men says, money is worth more than love.

16:06.027 --> 16:16.462
But the fun thing about this collection is it has these books in these unusual early bindings.

16:16.482 --> 16:20.388
And these crazy things like these leather boxes that collectors used to make and so forth.

16:20.408 --> 16:23.492
And the undergraduates come in here, and they've never seen anything like this before.

16:23.894 --> 16:26.798
We'll probably never see it again in this kind of intimacy.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.003
What is this, about eight by eight, would you say?

16:30.143 --> 16:31.005
About eight by eight.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.155
What is this seal?

16:38.195 --> 16:39.798
Well, let's finish here first.

16:39.818 --> 16:41.380
There's a lock of Lord Byron's hair.

16:41.420 --> 16:44.285
That's typical of the sort of things that get given to a place like this.

16:45.146 --> 16:46.628
And this book here...

16:52.548 --> 16:57.374
Sebastian Darrow of Freiburg, his 10 books of physics, printed in London in 1581.

16:57.955 --> 17:02.300
This was offered to the Beinecke Library nearly 20 years ago at a very reasonable price.

17:02.340 --> 17:03.722
It's one of four copies known.

17:04.443 --> 17:08.107
And at that time, a very distinguished scientist, Edmund Hutchinson, was president of the club.

17:08.147 --> 17:17.899
So I came to the governor's, and I said, we've never bought a book, but we're always telling our members that Watercrest, the sandwiches cost more than last year, and we ask for little contributions.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.964
What if we made a contribution to the university, to the library, by buying up?

17:22.231 --> 17:24.834
a rare book, and we can tell our members we did that.

17:24.914 --> 17:26.697
So we bought a book for the first time.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.380
This is in 1977.

17:30.101 --> 17:31.543
That's when you purchased your first book.

17:31.603 --> 17:32.183
That's right.

17:33.165 --> 17:36.209
And that was, I'd become the librarian of the club a few years before.

17:37.110 --> 17:40.654
But in any case, we bought this book, and that got us started.

17:40.854 --> 17:46.181
And all of these books have been acquired either by gift or purchase, you know, since the, in the last 15 years.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.644
I'm very proud to have added to the library in that way.

17:49.525 --> 17:51.748
I went out to California

17:52.302 --> 18:11.203
in 1980 and gave a talk at the Clark Library, and the guy came up to me and introduced himself and said, you know, I was in the Lizzie Club as an undergraduate in the early 70s, and I'm now a bookseller, and I have in my stock a copy of the first edition in Switzerland of that same book.

18:11.223 --> 18:17.450
It's also a rare book done in four or five copies, and we are the only library in the whole world to have both editions.

18:18.031 --> 18:18.411
Wow.

18:18.914 --> 18:21.176
in Switzerland, and then published the same year in London.

18:21.376 --> 18:22.918
What is the title of this book again?

18:23.258 --> 18:25.160
Physicorum Libri Decem.

18:27.042 --> 18:27.883
Where do I see it?

18:27.903 --> 18:28.003
Okay.

18:28.343 --> 18:30.145
Physicorum Libri Decem.

18:30.165 --> 18:30.365
Okay.

18:31.406 --> 18:32.227
It's in the catalog, right?

18:32.247 --> 18:39.474
It's in the catalog, under Vero, sorry, not V, but W-E-R-R-O, Sebastian Vero.

18:39.494 --> 18:39.594
Okay.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.756
Don't bother to transcribe that.

18:43.258 --> 18:47.622
And...

18:49.053 --> 18:55.020
We didn't have a scientific book, that's why we bought that, a school book.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.463
There's Vitruvius in architecture.

18:57.503 --> 19:02.448
Those are things that weren't represented in the collection, but they were, you know, contemporary things.

19:02.648 --> 19:06.713
Now, these still support the basic premise, which are contemporary things.

19:06.793 --> 19:07.694
Oh, absolutely.

19:08.035 --> 19:10.998
Things that he might have written that might have energized the writing of the plays.

19:11.078 --> 19:11.418
Exactly.

19:11.478 --> 19:14.622
But occasionally, we have been given other things.

19:14.973 --> 19:27.144
When I was offered from a member's library a copy of Johnson's and Stephen's Shakespeare, I accepted it, and I would like to have this wall covered with the 18th century editions of Shakespeare someday.

19:28.405 --> 19:37.433
Now, among the great collections of early English literature, the collection of Lord Littleton is at Trinity College, Cambridge.

19:37.534 --> 19:42.398
The collection of David Garrick is in the King's Library and the British Museum, but the provenance

19:42.850 --> 19:45.493
of every other collector of early English literature exists here.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.275
I mean, there's a lot to be learned about the history of English book collecting.

19:48.916 --> 19:54.662
But this book turned up in the library of James Osborne, and I'm the creator of the Osborne collection.

19:54.682 --> 19:56.884
But in any case, it has David Goetz's book there.

19:57.384 --> 20:08.115
And so I secured it from this collection to this, because this does represent James, another great collector of early English literature.

20:08.602 --> 20:11.264
Is there something on Osborne that I could read someplace?

20:11.284 --> 20:11.825
Oh, yeah, sure.

20:11.885 --> 20:15.889
I've written about the Alderman collection.

20:15.909 --> 20:17.250
But that's a collection of manuscripts.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.473
In any case, you see, here is 1733.

20:20.513 --> 20:23.896
That'll be Tybalt's edition of Shakespeare, so I have two of them here.

20:23.916 --> 20:36.027
But then again, if somebody comes along and offers you an early edition of Johnson's Dictionary, well, that's the sort of thing that people like to mention.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.702
is the visitor's book of the club.

20:38.722 --> 20:46.313
It goes back to the earliest days and has a signature of just about everybody connected with books, indeed, or a theater or whatever in it.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.357
You can't spend a lot of time with it, but there's D.B.

20:49.457 --> 20:49.898
Updike.

20:50.158 --> 20:57.328
Oh.

20:57.388 --> 20:57.789
There's H.L.

20:57.849 --> 20:58.149
Lindsay.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.411
There's John Goldsworthy.

21:00.132 --> 21:01.654
Wow.

21:01.674 --> 21:02.836
Lord Dunsany.

21:02.856 --> 21:03.937
Is that my goodness?

21:03.957 --> 21:05.119
That's the nephew of the writer.

21:05.588 --> 21:06.389
There's W.B.

21:06.509 --> 21:08.031
Yeats, George Yeats.

21:08.052 --> 21:08.572
There's E.H.

21:08.652 --> 21:09.774
Dring from Quaritches.

21:11.577 --> 21:13.159
There's John Goldsworthy again.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.604
There's Ruth Draper.

21:16.624 --> 21:17.525
Rachel Lindsay.

21:18.286 --> 21:18.747
Edna St.

21:18.767 --> 21:19.648
Vincent Millay.

21:24.295 --> 21:25.997
English singers, whoever they were.

21:26.878 --> 21:27.479
Isn't that great?

21:28.120 --> 21:31.545
But people love to come and look at this.

21:33.348 --> 21:36.272
Well, John Carter and Phil Hooper at the same time.

21:36.853 --> 21:38.175
Did they come at the same day?

21:38.195 --> 21:38.475
Yes.

21:39.616 --> 21:40.438
March 7th.

21:40.458 --> 21:40.858
Probably it is, huh?

21:41.739 --> 21:42.340
Would make sense.

21:42.380 --> 21:46.346
Jeffrey Keynes, John Shepard, George Washington.

21:46.366 --> 21:47.988
He's from the Huntington Library.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.053
There's James Sturber, there's Edith Sitwell.

21:52.073 --> 21:53.135
He got a whole page to himself.

21:53.155 --> 21:55.858
Well, I remember sketched Edith Sitwell when she visited here.

21:56.239 --> 21:56.399
Uh-huh.

21:58.342 --> 22:00.064
And this, which you asked about,

22:00.449 --> 22:03.694
I mentioned the 75th anniversary of the club that we celebrated.

22:05.136 --> 22:07.240
We wanted to do something big for that celebration.

22:07.260 --> 22:15.873
One of the members designed the Elizabethan Club medal, which we had struck by the Monet, the mint in Paris in 86.

22:15.893 --> 22:23.665
And we offered this free to members who contributed to the fund with which we bought that.

22:24.326 --> 22:26.710
And my idea was that

22:27.196 --> 22:37.172
We honor the founder, the members, present-day members of the club, honor the founder by acquiring something that was as grand as his original gift, and giving it to the club in his memory.

22:37.753 --> 22:50.294
And what we acquired, appropriately, from the firm of Korich, from whom he had acquired many of the books originally, was the sole surviving stage property from the Elizabethan theater, and something related to the Queen herself.

22:51.276 --> 22:53.980
Because in May of 1591,

22:54.398 --> 23:06.237
Lord Burleigh was having a house party at Tybalt's, his country residence, and there was sort of a mask put on at the time, and this did involve a messenger coming with a message from the Queen.

23:06.979 --> 23:21.182
And that was written by the Queen, not in her hand, but composed by the Queen, but in a spirit of fun, written up as though it were a state document and signed with a great seal, and carried to Tybalt's, and he ran on the platform.

23:22.242 --> 23:28.168
And that was available for sale in 1986, and so we bought it and brought it over from England.

23:28.188 --> 23:30.190
And that was at a MASQ, M-A-S-Q-U-E.

23:30.350 --> 23:30.931
That's right.

23:32.813 --> 23:36.497
And that's when your name begins it, doesn't it, huh?

23:37.718 --> 23:38.398
That's wonderful.

23:38.439 --> 23:40.541
And this, again, is what would you call this?

23:40.561 --> 23:41.422
That's the Great Seal of England.

23:41.442 --> 23:42.503
That's the Great Seal of England.

23:43.984 --> 23:45.886
And does that belong to a collector?

23:46.927 --> 23:48.269
Actually, it belonged to an investor.

23:48.289 --> 23:51.692
I'm not sure, but it was something that had been bought privately and offered.

23:52.128 --> 23:57.733
When I called Arthur Freeman at Porridge's, he said, I think I've got something here that might fit your bill.

23:57.753 --> 23:57.994
Okay.

23:58.734 --> 23:59.835
I can give you a copy of that.

23:59.895 --> 24:00.696
That describes this?

24:00.796 --> 24:00.997
Yes.

24:01.017 --> 24:01.717
Oh, great.

24:03.279 --> 24:03.859
That's wonderful.

24:04.060 --> 24:06.382
Arthur, I interviewed Arthur when I was in London.

24:06.562 --> 24:08.344
Oh, you did?

24:08.364 --> 24:08.504
Yeah.

24:08.544 --> 24:11.527
Well, when we're done, I'll be happy to try to give you that.

24:11.587 --> 24:13.469
It's pretty exciting, I think.

24:13.509 --> 24:17.933
Bill Scheide, I spent an afternoon with Mr. Scheide.

24:18.453 --> 24:20.415
Arthur will be here next week, as a matter of fact.

24:20.435 --> 24:21.156
He'll be seeing...

24:21.878 --> 24:29.927
In any case, all these little odds and ends.

24:30.027 --> 24:36.414
I'd found that leaf from Lincoln DeWord sort of gathering dust in a folder in a closet upstairs a few years ago.

24:36.915 --> 24:38.296
Oh, yeah.

24:38.316 --> 24:38.897
But there it was.

24:38.937 --> 24:41.860
These pretty council documents signed by members of the court.

24:42.481 --> 24:46.485
A poem by John Drinkwater, another poem by Alfred Noyes.

24:47.567 --> 24:49.589
These odds and ends have been given to us over the years.

24:50.069 --> 24:51.531
Here's the nephew of the founder,

24:51.848 --> 24:55.694
called me up a few years ago and said, would you like to have my uncle watch?

24:55.714 --> 24:57.696
And it's a nice gold Cartier watch.

24:57.716 --> 25:07.150
I'd rather have $3,000 cash, but there it is, with his initials on one side and the cross flags of his own yacht and the New York Yacht Club on the other.

25:08.151 --> 25:08.893
That was his thing.

25:09.213 --> 25:17.004
Now, how are you constantly keep a weather eye, so to speak, on things that you might want to purchase for the collection?

25:17.144 --> 25:17.765
Oh, yes.

25:17.865 --> 25:18.767
Oh, yes.

25:19.047 --> 25:21.771
About 77, this changed from...

25:22.797 --> 25:28.005
a collection that had been given to you to one that actually went into an acquisition mode.

25:28.025 --> 25:28.887
Is that a fair statement?

25:28.907 --> 25:30.109
Well, that's a fair statement.

25:30.129 --> 25:34.496
I mean, we always would have been ready to accept gifts, but the collection had been more or less static.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.781
I guess developmental was probably the word as opposed to acquisition.

25:37.801 --> 25:45.613
Yeah, but I sort of started going out and looking for things, and we've continued to do that.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.159
There's Ben Johnson's works.

25:49.730 --> 25:52.835
Do you have a, you must have a King James Bible someplace, no?

25:53.155 --> 25:56.360
No, I don't think there is a Bible in there.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.883
The collection should have one, however.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.767
Yeah, right, it would be appropriate.

26:02.570 --> 26:05.354
Especially where some people think Shakespeare might even have worked on it.

26:05.675 --> 26:07.798
Some people suggest Shakespeare might even have worked on it.

26:07.818 --> 26:12.044
So they say, an amusing thought.

26:12.225 --> 26:13.547
This is the West Worker.

26:14.749 --> 26:16.271
That's his schooner.

26:16.331 --> 26:16.952
His schooner.

26:17.287 --> 26:21.614
And that is the Couser got out in 1910, and that's Cochran, and that's the Kaisers.

26:22.335 --> 26:22.595
Mm-hmm.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.376
Those behind him.

26:23.857 --> 26:24.778
And these here are?

26:24.798 --> 26:26.221
Oh, these are the library calls, so.

26:26.902 --> 26:33.892
Now, I'm going to look for one thing, and I'm going to take those to the library.

26:33.912 --> 26:34.052
Okay.

26:34.072 --> 26:34.413
This is the one.

26:34.433 --> 26:45.049
I had a letter from somebody two days ago who was working on a list of all the book bindings by Sarah Prideaux, and I remembered I do have a Sarah Prideaux binding over here, so I'd better tell you about it.

26:46.126 --> 26:50.312
Tell me a little bit about what you do with the Beinecke and how that feeds into this.

26:51.754 --> 26:53.377
Well, I'm there because I'm here.

26:53.397 --> 26:56.922
I was a Yale undergraduate in 61 and a member of this club and a book collector.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.804
And I went to England for six years.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.086
You remember the name of A.N.L.

27:00.106 --> 27:00.647
Munby?

27:00.667 --> 27:01.328
Mm-hmm.

27:01.348 --> 27:04.333
Jim Munby was my supervisor for my PhD at King's.

27:04.353 --> 27:05.875
And then I had a fellowship in Edinburgh.

27:06.616 --> 27:10.261
I had known Jim Osborne, who was president of this club when I was an undergraduate.

27:10.281 --> 27:14.968
So I came back here to be curator of the Osborne Collection, which is English Literary and Historical Manuscripts.

27:15.725 --> 27:16.926
And that was the late 60s.

27:16.986 --> 27:20.089
And by the middle 70s, I was a librarian at the Busy Club, too.

27:21.030 --> 27:25.115
And I run the book collecting prize, so I have my fingers on the pulse of the collection.

27:25.135 --> 27:27.717
You know, we're going to have to talk some more, I think.

27:28.518 --> 27:29.960
I don't think one hour is empty enough.

27:29.980 --> 27:33.123
I might have to call you and maybe come back and see you.

27:33.163 --> 27:35.585
I'm here, except from late May to mid-June, I'm here.

27:36.326 --> 27:37.788
OK.

27:37.828 --> 27:38.668
Let's go out here.

27:38.929 --> 27:40.731
This is my package here.

27:41.832 --> 27:43.133
Yeah, that's your package.

27:44.294 --> 27:54.523
I was giving a bit of a tour, and I can latch you onto that, and then Christmas night and see it.

27:54.543 --> 28:05.393
But as an undergraduate in history of art, I became fascinated with the 19th century English passion for the Middle Ages.

28:05.413 --> 28:13.440
And I would collect the decorative arts of the Gothic Revival and architectural books and things like that and have a whole house full of it.

28:13.657 --> 28:19.342
And the man I was principally interested in was Welby Pugin, the architect of Howard and Carlton.

28:19.362 --> 28:24.646
But the collection of his books and things he designed and autographed letters and so forth is like nobody else's.

28:24.967 --> 28:28.930
I have things that aren't in any of the national collections in the United States.

28:29.511 --> 28:32.693
So that's been my private passion as a book collector for 30 years.

28:33.634 --> 28:35.556
And you are still an active collector.

28:35.656 --> 28:36.356
Oh, very much.

28:41.341 --> 28:43.022
It's not often where you find

28:43.812 --> 28:49.900
of an individual involved in institutional collecting who collects privately.

28:50.681 --> 28:52.904
Well, it used to be more the rule than it is now.

28:53.024 --> 29:04.059
Yeah, because so often you find that the satisfaction comes in collecting for the institution, and also you're able to get things that you can never get for yourself.

29:04.079 --> 29:04.460
Right.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.103
So my mentors, my role models,

29:07.640 --> 29:36.263
Gentlemen collectors happen to be creators at the same time so a few examples of that would be for instance These are mostly contemporary engravings documents you see These are two things

29:36.732 --> 29:38.934
very recently added.

29:38.975 --> 29:45.502
That's a portrait of the queen that was, but it came along with an autographed letter I bought for the library.

29:45.862 --> 29:46.523
Hi Matthew.

29:47.344 --> 29:55.353
I bought an autographed letter of one being a member of the court for the library, and that's a contemporary portrait that, you know, was a frontispiece for a history book or something like that.

29:55.473 --> 30:02.181
So the autographed letter is over there in the Beinecke, and I had that one framed and transferred it to the little beach.

30:02.201 --> 30:06.165
Everybody knows the fact that last full chain loo in New Haven.

30:08.508 --> 30:17.239
The curious thing about Cochran is that he knew exactly what he wanted to do with his money, and he wasn't going to just give it to your development fund.

30:17.979 --> 30:23.346
And one of the things he did at the end of his life was endow an organization in Washington, D.C., which is unique.

30:23.366 --> 30:24.647
It's called the College of Preachers.

30:25.388 --> 30:33.418
It's sort of attached to the Episcopal Cathedral down there, but it's a place that's run as a kind of study center where

30:34.023 --> 30:37.548
Episcopal priests can go and do workshops and preaching.

30:37.568 --> 30:46.120
He was very interested in improving the quality of preaching in churches, and so they run these workshops, and people come and study there.

30:46.180 --> 30:49.465
A couple of years ago, I met the man who was head of it.

30:49.866 --> 30:50.727
He said, come and see.

30:50.747 --> 30:53.471
So I went and stayed a couple of days while I did other things in Washington.

30:53.891 --> 31:00.621
What they've got is a kind of gothicky building like a stone cottage nestled into one side of the cathedral up there on the hill.

31:00.871 --> 31:03.996
And these people come and do workshops, and they have a dining hall.

31:04.797 --> 31:06.760
And it's terrific fun.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.284
Tell me a little bit about the book collecting prize.

31:09.304 --> 31:12.529
You said you had 23 entries this year.

31:12.549 --> 31:16.194
I'll give you a copy of our prospectus that talks about that.

31:16.215 --> 31:22.144
It's a prize for seniors and sophomores, 350 for a sophomore and $500 for a senior.

31:23.165 --> 31:26.831
And we normally have maybe 15 entries.

31:26.851 --> 31:28.954
23 this year was just extraordinary.

31:29.069 --> 31:38.941
They run everything from science fiction to kiddie lit to renaissance poetry to first editions of James Bond novels, you name it.

31:39.903 --> 31:48.694
Are you impressed by the quality?

31:48.774 --> 31:51.717
It's going to be tough this year because there are so many very good ones.

31:51.737 --> 31:54.621
Why does the university have such a contest?

31:55.107 --> 31:56.930
Well, it wasn't the university's idea.

31:56.970 --> 31:58.051
The best things never are.

31:58.071 --> 31:59.854
It was Mr. Van Syndrome's idea.

32:01.116 --> 32:02.638
But, okay.

32:04.321 --> 32:06.184
Nobody would go out and start something like this.

32:06.244 --> 32:08.727
I mean, it was Kim Brooker's idea founded on this one.

32:08.747 --> 32:09.429
Yeah, well, he won it.

32:09.489 --> 32:12.573
Put something out in Chicago to the honor and glory of Kim Brooker.

32:14.276 --> 32:17.721
Well, a fellow who was a runner-up here, Governor L.D.

32:17.781 --> 32:21.807
Brodsky, you know, I spent the day with L.D.

32:21.907 --> 32:22.408
out in St.

32:22.488 --> 32:23.089
Louis.

32:23.693 --> 32:26.676
Of course, it still drives him nuts that he didn't win this prize.

32:27.456 --> 32:29.498
I mean, it still... Is that right?

32:29.578 --> 32:32.881
...wankles him that he didn't... What class was he in?

32:33.581 --> 32:34.442
Oh, it was the late 50s.

32:34.462 --> 32:35.803
58, 59.

32:36.164 --> 32:38.486
That would have been the very beginning of that.

32:39.707 --> 32:39.807
Yeah.

32:39.907 --> 32:44.471
And the guy that won had a collection of railroad tickets or something like that.

32:44.491 --> 32:45.051
Oh, my heavens.

32:45.091 --> 32:46.593
Railway time table.

32:46.613 --> 32:47.233
Yeah.

32:47.253 --> 32:49.135
Well, that was... Well, Brodsky was the runner-up.

32:50.396 --> 32:51.357
We've had a couple of ones.

32:51.397 --> 32:52.958
Bill Reese won it, I guess.

32:53.562 --> 32:55.464
He's on our committee right now.

32:56.965 --> 32:58.146
Those are really great.

32:59.328 --> 33:00.809
He's wonderful for book collecting.

33:00.829 --> 33:01.590
He really is.

33:05.534 --> 33:12.120
The Hertha collection is the largest Hertha collection outside of Germany and probably the third largest in the world.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.843
And this is your specialty.

33:14.863 --> 33:19.367
Yeah, it began to be formed in the late 19th century by this man named Wilfried.

33:19.600 --> 33:26.733
William Alfred Speck, who was an American person but grew up in this country before the First World War, speaking German.

33:26.773 --> 33:35.589
And he went to a German-speaking school on the Hudson River outside of New York City, and became very interested in Goethe as a man.

33:37.332 --> 33:42.942
He overheard some older boys reading Goethe's, one of Goethe's early plays.

33:43.158 --> 33:50.256
He just became fascinated with Goethe and became a collector and just devoted his life to collecting every scrap he could get about Goethe.

33:51.078 --> 33:53.023
Not from a particularly scholarly person.

33:53.044 --> 33:54.126
Was he a wealthy man?

33:54.146 --> 33:56.934
No, he ran a drugstore.

33:57.234 --> 34:00.222
But he was very frustrated with being in the drugstore.

34:00.910 --> 34:05.474
He called it the pillory, because what he really wanted to go, he wanted to go out and collect stuff.

34:05.495 --> 34:09.258
So whenever he could get off, he would go down to New York City.

34:09.278 --> 34:10.279
A lot of this is in here?

34:10.299 --> 34:10.860
Yeah, good.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.063
And he would buy Goethe books, you know.

34:14.583 --> 34:18.047
And he amassed quite a large collection of Goethe books.

34:18.067 --> 34:20.229
Well, did he find them in this country, or did he go abroad?

34:20.389 --> 34:25.394
Yeah, now this is before the First World War, when there began to be anti-German sentiment.

34:25.414 --> 34:28.437
So, you know, this country has got vast German roots.

34:29.125 --> 34:29.686
Enormous.

34:29.746 --> 34:34.491
I think at one point that the largest ethnic group in this country was Germanic.

34:34.772 --> 34:40.919
And that all sort of got obscured during the First World War, when there was a lot of anti-German feeling.

34:40.959 --> 34:44.483
So anyway, here's Mr. Speck, and he's collecting these Goethe books.

34:44.503 --> 34:51.771
And someone at Vassar heard about his Goethe collection, and they said, well, we'll take the German class over to see these books.

34:51.791 --> 34:57.698
And they went, and amongst this class was Whitney's daughter, who then informed her relatives at Yale.

34:57.965 --> 35:02.432
Yale wooed Mr. Speck and got his collection, and it came here around 1913.

35:03.674 --> 35:04.416
Well, he was alive?

35:04.856 --> 35:06.279
Yeah, and he came with it.

35:06.659 --> 35:07.661
Oh, I love it.

35:07.941 --> 35:10.646
And was the curator until he died in 1928.

35:10.726 --> 35:18.559
And during this time, the collection expanded almost pretty cold because he was able to buy things in Germany during the inflation.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.385
And he didn't have to use his money either at this point.

35:22.405 --> 35:23.787
He had university money.

35:23.851 --> 35:34.744
I mean, at that point, you can think that most of the professors at Yale did their graduate work in Germany, because that was typical to go to Germany and do graduate work.

35:34.764 --> 35:39.810
I mean, Billy Phelps, the famous English professor at Yale, wrote odes in German.

35:39.850 --> 35:40.391
I've got them.

35:40.431 --> 35:41.472
I've seen them, you know.

35:41.492 --> 35:45.617
It's hard to imagine that German was such a current thing.

35:46.859 --> 35:48.400
So anyway, he was Mr. Spacking.

35:48.681 --> 35:52.305
Well, is it, strictly speaking, a Greta collection?

35:53.112 --> 35:57.939
How does it energize the other German collections?

35:57.999 --> 36:07.574
It was the German special collection for years by itself, and other German books went into the general collection, and they just collected Goethe.

36:07.594 --> 36:10.598
It's very philological, so he tried to collect

36:10.814 --> 36:17.440
of Goethe's works printed during his life, and every scrap of biographical material he could find about Goethe.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.841
Is it mainly printed material?

36:19.262 --> 36:20.943
We have manuscripts as well.

36:21.064 --> 36:22.285
From his collection?

36:22.365 --> 36:23.586
Did he collect manuscripts?

36:24.667 --> 36:38.880
And so you have almost every variant of Goethe's works printed during his lifetime, and almost every collected edition up to the critical edition that began around the 1900s, and then selected things afterwards, and vast

36:39.130 --> 36:43.816
materials relating to Goethe's contemporary reception and his biography.

36:44.597 --> 36:50.786
And Speck didn't actually write scholarly books, but he thought, you know, if he could absorb Goethe, he would be a better person.

36:50.886 --> 36:54.190
Well, would you say he became a scholar through his collection?

36:55.151 --> 36:56.914
He wrote some articles.

36:57.234 --> 36:59.016
They tend to be very historical.

36:59.037 --> 37:00.278
He certainly knew his collection.

37:00.699 --> 37:00.919
Oh, yeah.

37:01.304 --> 37:05.128
We're not talking about an accumulator who was out to acquire.

37:05.289 --> 37:09.734
No, I think he did collect pots, too, so he had that kind of collector's mentality.

37:09.754 --> 37:10.274
You know what I mean?

37:10.294 --> 37:11.936
Some people were collectors.

37:12.016 --> 37:12.697
You mean pots?

37:12.717 --> 37:13.658
What do you mean by pots?

37:14.018 --> 37:16.842
Pots, P-O-T-S, ceramic.

37:17.442 --> 37:18.443
That's for my typist.

37:20.486 --> 37:23.029
One day she might be talking about a fellow named P-O-T-T-S.

37:25.351 --> 37:29.556
Did he have anything that might be considered today, especially rare?

37:29.823 --> 37:37.012
by itself, or is this a collection in the true sense that its significance comes in its totality as a collection?

37:37.032 --> 37:38.013
Yes, that's very true.

37:38.073 --> 37:44.621
It has very rare things in it and very common things, and I think he didn't particularly make this distinction.

37:44.641 --> 37:47.344
We do now, because it was a study collection.

37:47.405 --> 37:59.239
It served a long while in the 30s and 40s as the graduate reading room for graduate students in German, and it was in Sterling Library and functioned as their seminar room, really.

37:59.725 --> 38:04.210
The fact that the rare things were black because they're glowing, not because they were rare.

38:04.230 --> 38:06.132
And in that sense, it was a true collection.

38:06.973 --> 38:09.876
Which impresses me as much as anything, frankly.

38:09.896 --> 38:19.647
But I can show you some of the very rare things.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.149
Well, I can see right off that.

38:21.789 --> 38:23.071
Are these part of his things, too?

38:23.091 --> 38:23.872
Yeah.

38:23.892 --> 38:25.193
Well, he's got some pretty extraordinary.

38:25.213 --> 38:27.436
Now, where did he keep all of them?

38:27.476 --> 38:28.076
These are this one.

38:28.116 --> 38:29.698
These are all folios, yeah.

38:30.252 --> 38:43.407
It's the first edition of Vietjean, The Sorrows of Young Vietjean.

38:43.427 --> 38:43.608
1774.

38:43.628 --> 38:48.633
And you can always tell it from the next thing because it has the Iraq on there.

38:48.914 --> 38:51.537
And is that an original binding?

38:51.697 --> 38:54.260
Oh, I would have done it.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.783
That's pretty.

38:57.708 --> 38:59.050
How do we spell the title of that?

38:59.070 --> 39:01.954
I'll sort of help out my titles.

39:02.675 --> 39:04.177
W-E-R-T-H-E-R.

39:04.197 --> 39:05.559
Thank you.

39:05.579 --> 39:11.228
The Sorrows of Young Vetra, I think you call it.

39:12.429 --> 39:15.514
Of course, he has this in numerous editions, I'm sure, too, right?

39:15.534 --> 39:18.678
Yeah, there were many pirated editions during the first year.

39:18.698 --> 39:20.301
I mean, you know, it goes right along here.

39:20.441 --> 39:27.291
And he collected them because they were variants, but now they're very useful because people— Texturally, they were variants?

39:27.311 --> 39:27.411
Yeah.

39:27.644 --> 39:30.188
or pirated editions of different printings.

39:30.208 --> 39:40.183
And now they're very valuable because you can see how this work entered the popular consciousness, and people study what they call reception history.

39:40.203 --> 39:45.351
This is the very first collected works of Goethe, which was a pirated edition.

39:46.212 --> 39:52.321
So the first collected edition of Goethe was an unauthorized collection?

39:52.341 --> 39:52.682
1775.

39:53.563 --> 39:54.985
That's pretty interesting.

39:56.433 --> 40:08.664
This is a very nice picture part of the theory of colors.

40:09.405 --> 40:11.387
These are litho's eyes, right?

40:11.507 --> 40:12.828
Are they hand painted?

40:12.848 --> 40:15.370
I think they're hand colored.

40:16.611 --> 40:23.858
You know, Gertrude tried to disprove Newton's.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.142
These are hand-painted by whom?

40:28.402 --> 40:30.125
No wonder.

40:30.485 --> 40:33.969
Well, somebody at the publisher.

40:34.149 --> 40:38.154
So the art is not particularly relevant to the importance of the book.

40:38.174 --> 40:38.555
The what?

40:38.595 --> 40:40.317
The artwork, particularly.

40:41.018 --> 40:43.861
Well, it's interesting to have it in that state there untrimmed.

40:46.084 --> 40:49.268
How large is this collection, would you say, as a collection?

40:50.069 --> 40:52.192
I'll give you an article when we get downstairs.

40:52.212 --> 40:53.033
It has that.

40:53.253 --> 40:55.836
All the articles.

40:58.229 --> 40:59.391
I don't know.

40:59.811 --> 41:00.212
That's fine.

41:00.853 --> 41:02.795
I'm sure there's some indication of it in here, too.

41:03.176 --> 41:04.338
Probably.

41:04.358 --> 41:05.019
Where are we now?

41:05.059 --> 41:06.240
On the ground floor, I assume.

41:06.260 --> 41:09.345
We're right under the closet when you walk into the building.

41:09.886 --> 41:10.526
Okay.

41:11.047 --> 41:18.878
And the Speck Collection has it as well, a lot of music that relates to Goethe.

41:18.898 --> 41:21.402
This is one of the very rarest.

41:24.006 --> 41:25.508
It's Leipziger Wiederbuch.

41:26.369 --> 41:27.190
Oh.

41:27.457 --> 41:31.763
It's supposed to be the first time any poem of Virta was printed.

41:32.564 --> 41:37.630
And it's an interesting book because it's an early experiment in printing music from movable type.

41:38.451 --> 41:45.460
And you can see the little breaks in the gap there that he must have had a piece of type to accommodate each note.

41:45.480 --> 41:46.521
It was a very difficult thing.

41:46.561 --> 41:48.063
I've read about music.

41:48.123 --> 41:50.126
I mean, it was a very difficult thing.

41:50.226 --> 41:51.928
Mostly at this point you see it engraved.

41:51.948 --> 41:53.570
You can actually see the note.

41:53.590 --> 41:55.993
What's the date on this?

41:56.013 --> 41:56.434
1770.

41:56.532 --> 42:02.079
And the title of that, is that?

42:02.099 --> 42:05.863
Well, it's called the Leipziger Liederbuch.

42:05.883 --> 42:10.469
It's called Neue Lieder in Melodien.

42:10.809 --> 42:13.092
Oh, okay.

42:13.112 --> 42:16.155
We're going to try that.

42:16.175 --> 42:20.260
But we have things like the first edition of Schubert's setting of the L-Phoenig.

42:20.340 --> 42:21.542
That's something that's good.

42:21.562 --> 42:22.944
Yeah, L-K-O-N-I-G.

42:23.825 --> 42:24.766
Okay, O-Omlaug.

42:25.286 --> 42:25.847
O-Omlaug.

42:26.182 --> 42:31.989
And I just don't think people know, you know.

42:32.109 --> 42:35.253
It's the first edition.

42:35.273 --> 42:35.974
That's beautiful.

42:36.214 --> 42:37.055
Not foxed at all.

42:37.075 --> 42:39.158
Now, has this been treated by you people, conserved?

42:39.178 --> 42:40.339
Do you think that's the original?

42:41.100 --> 42:42.181
No, I don't think so.

42:42.201 --> 42:44.384
I don't think it's been washed.

42:44.404 --> 42:47.148
It's remarkably free of foxing, isn't it?

42:47.168 --> 42:49.330
Yeah.

42:49.350 --> 42:54.957
Beautiful.

42:56.287 --> 43:06.639
As I said, the Speck Collection was the special German rare book collection until about 1945 when Kurt von Faber-Dufour came to Yale.

43:07.440 --> 43:14.669
And Kurt von Faber-Dufour was a descendant of the Kater publishing family in Germany, who was actually Goethe's publisher.

43:14.689 --> 43:20.556
But he was a rare book dealer, and he founded a firm called Karl & Faber.

43:20.772 --> 43:24.697
in Munich, which is now called Hutton and Karl.

43:24.717 --> 43:25.498
He was the Farber.

43:26.699 --> 43:27.820
And so he was a book dealer.

43:28.521 --> 43:32.867
And his interest was the 17th century, and I can show you this book.

43:39.475 --> 43:42.358
Yale very much is a collection of collections then, isn't it?

43:48.160 --> 43:55.813
He was very interested in 17th century books, the so-called Baroque period, which he defined very broadly from about 1600 to 1750.

43:55.833 --> 44:03.385
This was at a time before scholars and collectors got interested in this period.

44:03.726 --> 44:05.408
They're not bibliophile books.

44:05.468 --> 44:06.310
They're fairly ugly.

44:06.330 --> 44:14.944
I mean, you know, it was a century of Germany being at war, and the paper is bad, and the printing is sloppy, and it isn't a bibliophile kind of century.

44:15.700 --> 44:21.568
But he was very interested in this and amassed a very fine collection of his 17th century books through his dealership.

44:21.729 --> 44:24.332
He was able to substitute copies when he got a better one.

44:24.372 --> 44:25.854
How do we spell his name?

44:26.175 --> 44:34.787
Kurt, C-U-R-T, Fun, D-O-N, Faber, F-A-B-E-R, Du, D-U, F-A-U-R.

44:34.807 --> 44:36.029
F-A-U-R.

44:37.551 --> 44:43.159
And he was for a few years at Harvard when he first came out of Germany.

44:43.797 --> 44:51.184
in the early 40s, and Harvard, the story goes, refused to make him a faculty person, and so he came to Yale.

44:51.544 --> 44:53.086
This was the first time Harvard did that.

44:53.706 --> 44:54.908
Where he taught a course.

44:54.988 --> 45:01.394
In fact, my husband took his course when he was a graduate student, and he was a wonderful man from all accounts.

45:01.414 --> 45:11.003
I never knew him, very jovial and funny, and really knew these bits and wrote a printed catalog called German Baroque Literature.

45:11.658 --> 45:18.946
shortly before his death had compiled a second volume as a catalog.

45:20.768 --> 45:21.789
Well, what can I say about this?

45:21.809 --> 45:34.962
This is the Renaissance century in Germany, really, where they had societies to improve the language, and where they were adapting European verse forms to German languages.

45:35.043 --> 45:36.484
It's a very interesting thing.

45:36.633 --> 45:39.057
So intellectually, it was rich.

45:39.177 --> 45:43.484
In terms of the book arts, though, it was very functional, right?

45:43.504 --> 45:47.550
You get a lot of small devotional books like that.

45:47.570 --> 45:48.672
Is that a vellum?

45:49.173 --> 45:53.479
Yeah, they're mostly bound in parchment, white parchment.

45:53.499 --> 45:54.200
It's very common.

45:57.005 --> 45:59.148
What's your title, by the way?

45:59.869 --> 46:03.235
Curator is the collection of German literature.

46:03.255 --> 46:04.176
German literature.

46:06.316 --> 46:09.301
This is one of the rarest.

46:09.441 --> 46:20.459
One of the most famous novels of the century was called Sympathismus.

46:21.881 --> 46:24.745
The Germans had a stamp a couple of years ago taking this.

46:24.765 --> 46:28.652
It was this very famous Piccaro novel of the 18th century.

46:28.672 --> 46:29.613
It's the first edition.

46:32.878 --> 46:33.319
It's beautiful.

46:35.527 --> 46:43.538
It's one of the very rarest ones in this collection.

46:43.558 --> 46:46.803
It's a... That's his book plate here.

46:46.823 --> 46:46.923
Yeah.

46:46.943 --> 46:51.008
That's a cut-out one, actually.

46:51.249 --> 46:53.912
The whole thing looks like that.

46:54.794 --> 46:58.419
They cut him up for a kind of small book.

46:58.439 --> 47:03.846
And this is a book of religious poetry by a man named Ferran Kuhlman.

47:04.383 --> 47:06.445
They called it the Kuhl Salter.

47:06.465 --> 47:08.748
It was the Kuhl Salter.

47:08.768 --> 47:11.672
There were only two or three copies of this in the world.

47:11.792 --> 47:13.814
Really?

47:14.215 --> 47:15.696
Who acquired this?

47:16.457 --> 47:26.669
This is, again, the correct— Well, this would have been acquired during Kurt's time as curator here, after he came to Yale, because of his two library associates.

47:26.689 --> 47:27.490
It was pretty shrewd.

47:27.771 --> 47:28.712
Now, you've done this.

47:28.732 --> 47:31.836
You bring these gentlemen, these people, these collectors in as curators.

47:31.916 --> 47:32.196
Who?

47:32.615 --> 47:38.822
It was kind of an inducement, isn't it, to— Well, it happened in the German collection, and I don't know, in the rest of the library.

47:39.683 --> 47:45.450
I suppose the Walpole man.

47:45.470 --> 47:46.010
Indeed.

47:46.391 --> 47:50.235
Lewis was—Bufty Lewis was one of those persons.

47:51.076 --> 47:54.160
Wasn't he part of the university in some fashion, you know?

47:54.560 --> 47:55.381
Oh, yeah.

47:57.003 --> 47:57.103
Yeah.

47:58.265 --> 48:02.251
You know, this stuff is kind of obscure, probably, for your purposes.

48:02.271 --> 48:08.461
Well, I don't think it's worth the whole treatment, but these little stories are very interesting.

48:08.481 --> 48:17.294
And if you look at the German collection, what interests me about it, looking at the whole history of it from 1913, that it's an immigrant collection.

48:17.314 --> 48:21.100
You have Speck, who was a German-American.

48:22.379 --> 48:51.036
he was his family came from germany and were speaking german they were real german american immigrants it's interesting to me when you look at it broadly like that that that's an early wave of i don't know exactly when sex parents came here you know but obviously from this german american immigration and

48:51.792 --> 48:57.423
having this kind of interest in German, old classical German culture, Goethe and Schiller.

48:59.226 --> 49:04.376
And then in the 40s, you get the next wave of the Nazi wave, you know, the immigration.

49:04.436 --> 49:13.513
And we have, well, a quote from Barbara Dufour who brought our Baroque collection and much more on, and it's really the starting point of our general

49:13.882 --> 49:14.945
He came in the 40s?

49:15.005 --> 49:15.868
He was part of that?

49:15.888 --> 49:16.429
Yeah.

49:16.449 --> 49:23.369
Well, you see, there was a whole wave of people from Germany, particularly Jewish people who were terrified of persecution.

49:23.409 --> 49:27.942
You'd have a whole tradition in bookselling in this country that came over here.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.763
Yeah, well, he's one of them.

49:29.803 --> 49:30.524
He's one of them.

49:30.564 --> 49:34.630
There was a lecture at Columbia on the precise subject.

49:34.650 --> 49:39.618
Of course, Crouse was one of the more notable ones, but there's a family out in California, I think.

49:41.060 --> 49:47.851
There was actually a piece, a lecture given at Columbia on that, so Kurt was part of that.

49:47.871 --> 49:53.119
Yes, and then the other parts of the collection, I mean, we've acquired the

49:53.943 --> 49:57.530
He was part of the archive of Kurt Wolf, the publisher in Germany.

49:57.570 --> 50:01.017
He was another one who came out of Germany and established Pantheon Books.

50:01.939 --> 50:04.343
You've got their books here?

50:04.764 --> 50:08.832
Not books, but some of the papers from the earlier part of his career.

50:08.852 --> 50:12.299
I don't have the Pantheon Books part, but when he was the Kurt Wolf fellow.

50:12.319 --> 50:13.461
That's W-O-L-F-E, right?

50:14.242 --> 50:14.723
W-O-L-F-F.

50:15.765 --> 50:16.086
F-F.

50:17.348 --> 50:26.217
And he was a very famous publisher in Germany in the 20s and before, and he published most of the expressions, you know, in Germany.

50:28.399 --> 50:30.642
So I have many of the letters.

50:30.662 --> 50:33.084
Was he a collector, or you basically have his archival things?

50:33.224 --> 50:34.245
He was a collector.

50:34.265 --> 50:36.468
I don't have the book.

50:36.488 --> 50:40.732
I have these letters, you know, I have Kafka letters, and I have Lutheran letters.

50:40.752 --> 50:41.733
Oh, that's pretty nice.

50:41.833 --> 50:41.973
Yeah.

50:42.714 --> 50:44.996
Well, Pantheon, I think, well, Schocken, I guess.

50:45.016 --> 50:45.617
Schocken.

50:45.918 --> 50:48.442
He's a publisher.

50:48.642 --> 50:55.152
Kafka, so there isn't a lot of Kafka, but he was a publisher in those days.

50:55.172 --> 51:00.579
That's another way we've been, and I have the archive of Hemant Brauch, who was ex-Albert Austria.

51:01.280 --> 51:01.601
And who is?

51:01.661 --> 51:03.404
How do we spell that?

51:03.704 --> 51:03.984
B-R-O-C-H.

51:04.205 --> 51:04.685
Okay.

51:04.706 --> 51:05.927
I gave you a little pamphlet.

51:05.987 --> 51:06.789
Okay, good.

51:06.849 --> 51:08.010
This is for my typist book.

51:08.691 --> 51:08.952
Right.

51:08.972 --> 51:13.258
He wrote the latest book.

51:13.492 --> 51:21.904
popular publication was a book called The Spell that came out.

51:21.924 --> 51:23.066
I can find out.

51:23.526 --> 51:30.156
So really, Yale has been a beneficiary to some extent of people who were forced to flee their country.

51:30.296 --> 51:31.418
Well, the German collection.

51:31.438 --> 51:33.200
The German collection.

51:33.220 --> 51:42.874
You know, I look at it and it's curious that in this library now, one thing we've been collecting is Polish exile writers.

51:43.748 --> 51:47.353
And we got the papers of Czesław Lilosz.

51:47.373 --> 51:47.814
Oh, really?

51:48.194 --> 51:57.607
And Alexander Butt, and that whole Polish generation, part of whom I've been at Kralt to Paris, and my colleague Vincent is working on this one.

51:57.647 --> 52:03.315
Will that be part of the same collection, or will that be a collection in its own right, a Polish collection?

52:03.335 --> 52:07.140
Right now, it's part of our, what we call, modern books and papers.

52:07.357 --> 52:09.780
He lives out in California, I think.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.282
He does in Berkeley, yeah.

52:11.302 --> 52:12.684
And he was the first one we acquired.

52:12.845 --> 52:14.347
Well, that's a good one, Nobel laureate.

52:14.367 --> 52:15.789
Yeah, and that's the way you do it.

52:15.809 --> 52:22.798
You know, you get one person of a group, and then the others come, and his friend I was in the Vat's papers to get over and negotiate.

52:22.818 --> 52:32.031
One wonders, though, you know, now with Poland emerging from the East, and politically, you wonder what'll happen.

52:32.051 --> 52:32.672
Maybe they'll

52:33.175 --> 52:34.217
I mean, the stuff is here.

52:34.277 --> 52:36.660
Well, he's been an American for such a long time.

52:36.681 --> 52:39.886
I don't know if he has American citizenship, does he?

52:39.906 --> 52:54.609
It'll be interesting because now, you see, I couldn't acquire the papers of the German author because they go to Mabach in Germany, which is a huge literary archive, and the people are naturally going to give their papers in their own country right with it.

52:54.709 --> 52:55.470
Who do you think?

52:55.518 --> 52:59.142
They feel the resonance and all the people reading it.

52:59.162 --> 53:04.008
And, of course, the scholars, the scholarly tradition is going to be in the country, you would think.

53:04.269 --> 53:06.612
Well, partly, mostly.

53:06.972 --> 53:13.119
But back in the 50s, there was Herman Brock gave his papers here because the conditions weren't yet right.

53:13.139 --> 53:17.385
And now that situation applies to Poland, but now that's changing.

53:17.485 --> 53:20.669
And so on.

53:20.689 --> 53:21.890
That's fascinating.

53:21.910 --> 53:23.432
It really is.

53:24.087 --> 53:25.589
These are my things here.

53:26.350 --> 53:31.597
But no, this collection, well, I don't suppose Speck would be an exile.

53:31.617 --> 53:32.518
He's an immigrant.

53:35.081 --> 53:36.703
Well, so you, but that is interesting.

53:36.883 --> 53:39.747
We have an ethnic exile collections and immigrant collections.

53:39.767 --> 53:40.808
We can even distinguish.

53:51.622 --> 53:53.925
How would you rank it in the collection?

53:55.593 --> 53:56.475
Let's say nationally.

53:56.495 --> 53:59.901
Let's start nationally as a German collection.

53:59.921 --> 54:04.009
Well, I tend to see it in the context of Stirling Library as well.

54:04.409 --> 54:04.890
Okay.

54:04.910 --> 54:05.672
Well, I think that's fair.

54:05.972 --> 54:14.468
Because Yale, in general, started to buy since this German literature in a very exhaustive way from, say, 1890s on.

54:15.210 --> 54:19.137
So taking this collection in the context of Yale, I think, always.

54:19.488 --> 54:25.496
How do you get into, how do you gain entry to Bynapy from Sterling?

54:25.757 --> 54:28.020
Now you say taking Sterling into account.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.582
What's the condition?

54:31.064 --> 54:33.287
Why is stuff here as opposed to there?

54:33.327 --> 54:38.835
Well, I don't know.

54:38.855 --> 54:48.128
Just when the building was put up, they just brought over what was the old rare bookman collection, and that's what you see in the tower.

54:48.901 --> 54:50.223
That's what we call it, the Tower?

54:50.644 --> 54:51.786
The Tower, the Book Tower.

54:51.966 --> 54:53.529
The Book Tower?

54:53.549 --> 54:54.570
The General Collection.

54:55.712 --> 55:04.687
And then they brought over several special collections, the German-American, the Osborn Collection, the Parks and the Western American.

55:07.531 --> 55:12.880
Now, I don't know why they decided not to be known for African and Slavic.

55:13.661 --> 55:14.282
And they may yet.

55:14.883 --> 55:16.005
They may yet, but there are.

55:16.525 --> 55:27.103
I think it partly has to do with the fact that most of our acquisitions are antiquarian.

55:28.024 --> 55:37.159
We don't do secondary stuff.

55:37.179 --> 55:42.448
I don't know, it's hard to say why a book is here and not there.

55:42.867 --> 55:47.576
I thought there might be a clear criteria that's criterion as well.

55:47.616 --> 55:49.420
There are different criteria in different areas.

55:49.440 --> 55:55.772
There are certain chronological considerations that differ a good deal on, you know, I think it's 1820.

55:55.792 --> 56:00.822
But I think antiquarian is a good place to start as opposed to, you know, secondary.

56:00.862 --> 56:05.010
Something like for automatic transfer, there are different cutoff things in different forms.

56:05.311 --> 56:15.118
areas like later for American works than for European works, because we couldn't possibly have the whole European 17th century over here.
