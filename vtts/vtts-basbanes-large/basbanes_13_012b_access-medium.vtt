00:02.579 --> 00:13.711
The other presidents who were assassinated did not have a congressional committee that actually did research or had an investigation on the assassinations itself.

00:14.332 --> 00:21.840
So, community assassinations, you had a couple of congressional committees that actually started that right after he was assassinated.

00:22.361 --> 00:25.224
That's how a lot of records started to be generated by the federal government.

00:25.924 --> 00:31.050
So that has a tie in as opposed to other assassinations that didn't have congressional investigations.

00:31.537 --> 00:40.430
Does something like that have its own wing, its own... No, but it's not its own wing, but it has its own staff.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.675
And do you have levels of security?

00:44.176 --> 00:47.180
Actually, that reminds me of something else that we have in this building.

00:47.220 --> 00:57.375
We have all of the classified materials, not for the whole system, because presidential libraries also have their own classified materials, but we have a huge declassification project going on.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.188
It's an ongoing thing.

00:59.348 --> 01:01.732
It is governed by an executive order.

01:02.914 --> 01:08.363
And we have, I think, 425 million pages of classified materials.

01:08.383 --> 01:09.686
But going back how far?

01:10.527 --> 01:11.689
Oh, well, that's sort of a touchy subject.

01:11.709 --> 01:16.618
The oldest document is World War I. There's at least one document that's still classified.

01:17.058 --> 01:17.720
Is that right?

01:17.880 --> 01:18.461
No kidding.

01:18.481 --> 01:22.087
Do you guys know what it is?

01:22.107 --> 01:22.688
I don't know.

01:22.972 --> 01:23.954
Classified.

01:25.396 --> 01:26.738
Beyond that, it's difficult to say.

01:26.918 --> 01:29.402
There is a World War I classifier.

01:29.462 --> 01:35.051
And does it have a declass on it?

01:35.071 --> 01:36.653
Well, here's the thing.

01:36.793 --> 01:43.303
The new effective order says that all documents over 25 years old will be automatically declassified for the next few years.

01:44.465 --> 01:51.055
But there's a caveat in there, and the caveat applies to all different kinds of things like sources and methods and, you know, federal governments.

01:51.878 --> 01:56.865
So that will keep a lot of records that are more than 25 years.

01:58.307 --> 02:01.992
What source from 1917 would still be?

02:02.012 --> 02:20.957
Well, you know, one of the problems for the National Archives is that, first of all, if one agency created a record, but they created this document in cahoots with, say, two other agencies, if the one agency wants to be classified, say the State Department wants to be classified, but it

02:21.190 --> 02:23.093
had some bearing on DOD and CIA.

02:23.113 --> 02:24.575
They have to send it to those two agencies.

02:24.595 --> 02:25.476
They all have to concur.

02:25.817 --> 02:27.800
And that's true with foreign countries, too.

02:27.920 --> 02:37.413
So if we have a document that, say, was created along with another country, and we want to declassify, we have to get permission from that country, too.

02:37.694 --> 02:44.784
So it can become a very time-consuming situation.

02:44.804 --> 02:49.471
Well, there was a piece in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago about CIA.

02:49.491 --> 02:49.611
Right.

02:49.743 --> 02:51.125
I think I was the Wall Street Journalist.

02:51.185 --> 02:52.928
Was it the Journalist?

02:54.451 --> 02:56.854
Yeah, my wife cooks the Journalist.

02:56.874 --> 02:56.975
Yeah.

02:57.435 --> 03:06.149
Well, we, you know, this new executive order has done amazing things for us, and we've declassified, you know, hundreds of thousands of documents that ordinarily wouldn't have been declassified.

03:06.189 --> 03:09.655
And this is an ongoing thing that the agencies are participating in.

03:11.357 --> 03:16.746
So it's going to pry open a lot of material that wasn't open before.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.115
But still, millions of haters will remain classified.

03:21.437 --> 03:23.900
So, should we go on our tour?

03:23.920 --> 03:24.501
Yeah.

03:26.104 --> 03:35.477
That's all right.

03:36.239 --> 03:36.779
Thanks.

03:36.799 --> 03:42.328
I think we're going to go upstairs and come back.

03:42.348 --> 03:42.548
What call?

03:42.916 --> 03:58.379
What the researchers does, they come in, they'll check in the complex itself by giving their card to the staff, the security personnel.

03:58.419 --> 03:59.882
Oh, okay.

04:00.142 --> 04:07.233
Interesting little drama unfolding.

04:09.656 --> 04:10.678
Thank you.

04:10.844 --> 04:11.304
I'm sorry.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.067
What were you saying?

04:14.088 --> 04:19.173
Well, once you show your card to the security person, they'll be able to scan you in.

04:20.234 --> 04:21.235
Uh-huh.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.658
Everybody has to scan you in.

04:23.678 --> 04:25.380
You've been up school now.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.742
We're just going to walk home.

04:31.627 --> 04:34.810
Come on.

04:40.763 --> 04:43.686
And we also have a security classifier.

04:43.706 --> 04:45.768
That's what we're fixed for.

04:45.988 --> 04:54.416
And if you've ever been looking at security classifiers, you have to get permission from the agency to have some agency to do this.

04:54.436 --> 04:59.761
And maybe you have to be cleared.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.011
So where was all this?

05:10.109 --> 05:13.292
You probably answered that, but where was all this material prior to four years ago?

05:13.372 --> 05:15.034
Everywhere, right?

05:15.955 --> 05:17.116
Yeah, everywhere.

05:17.136 --> 05:22.821
It was down in Alexandria, Maryland, and we had staff and several different offices downtown.

05:22.841 --> 05:26.364
The idea was to contain everything into our own building.

05:26.384 --> 05:31.950
We still actually have a record center, too.

05:31.970 --> 05:39.677
What government, is there a department, or is this just an independent agency that works in any federal department of

05:40.231 --> 05:41.492
Bacteria or whatever.

05:41.512 --> 05:46.799
I mean, this is under any... No, we're an independent agency, right?

05:47.620 --> 05:50.383
We need our independence from the General Services Administration.

05:50.403 --> 05:51.084
General Services, GSA.

05:51.184 --> 05:51.344
Okay.

05:52.005 --> 05:53.266
That's what I was thinking about.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.267
Go check your research room.

05:54.568 --> 05:59.854
And each research room has a desk that the research committee has signed into, and again, we scan the carnet.

06:00.695 --> 06:06.541
When we do that, we're actually keeping the record of how many people use each individual research room.

06:06.561 --> 06:07.943
That's why we scan the carnet.

06:08.260 --> 06:17.751
And what research will do, they'll talk to one of the specialists up here, and they'll tell them the research they're doing, and they'll get them signing in so they can actually locate the images they want.

06:18.272 --> 06:21.976
And once they find the images, they can reproduce the image themselves.

06:22.076 --> 06:25.720
They can use the copy cranes here to reproduce the images.

06:25.740 --> 06:27.422
They bring in their own cameras they shoot.

06:27.642 --> 06:28.704
Oh, you let them do that?

06:28.864 --> 06:29.304
Yes, you do.

06:30.045 --> 06:35.792
We have two Polaroid copiers, so you can make Polaroid... So you have instant shots.

06:36.052 --> 06:36.833
Instant shots.

06:37.167 --> 06:47.216
And we have a color copier here where you can actually do a slide and a color paper copy from the photograph itself.

06:47.936 --> 06:56.123
And the color copier is really very good because it almost looks like a real photograph.

06:56.143 --> 06:57.544
Almost.

06:57.564 --> 07:06.432
So we have those and we have regular xerxes that people can actually xerxes material themselves.

07:06.749 --> 07:18.901
the private sector and if you decide you want to have photographs reproduced by the National Archives, we have some private contractors.

07:18.921 --> 07:23.945
The federal government also has photographs by some very famous photographers like Ansel Adams.

07:25.287 --> 07:29.150
We have his photographs here, we have Matthew Braggie's photographs here.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.913
I didn't know you had evidence.

07:31.933 --> 07:35.997
When you go to Prince Plus and you see the Ansel Adams photographs,

07:36.449 --> 07:39.946
Look and see what they give as the source for what it should.

07:40.006 --> 07:41.835
Sometimes it should say National Art Council.

07:42.035 --> 07:44.839
I thought all that stuff was out of California.

07:44.999 --> 07:45.700
I didn't know that.

07:45.720 --> 07:52.810
Actually, I think the Library of Congress will come too, but we have a large portion that you can work for the federal government.

07:52.830 --> 08:03.085
So any of these famous photographers like Dorothea Lange, Lewis Hines, whenever they were contracted by the federal government to do work, we then have their original name.

08:03.105 --> 08:05.228
So all the WPA photos are here?

08:05.509 --> 08:06.430
Actually, they're not.

08:06.490 --> 08:07.551
Not all of them are here.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.673
They're at the Library of Congress.

08:08.693 --> 08:09.454
A lot of them are.

08:09.474 --> 08:10.776
But the ones that work...

08:10.756 --> 08:14.861
done for congressional investigations.

08:15.102 --> 08:17.965
The Walker Evans photos.

08:17.986 --> 08:18.446
Some of those are here.

08:18.466 --> 08:18.867
A lot of those are .

08:18.887 --> 08:26.357
We have a huge collection of the Matthew Brady photographs and the original glass plate magnets.

08:26.577 --> 08:26.657
Wow.

08:26.677 --> 08:34.587
And in fact, our lab downstairs designs special housing for those glass plate magnets, so they're each in their own housing so they won't get broken and they don't get used in.

08:34.607 --> 08:37.371
So if somebody asks to see an original Lance and Laddams photo,

08:38.127 --> 08:38.969
Do you let them?

08:38.989 --> 08:41.253
Well, I think it's on sort of a need basis.

08:41.273 --> 08:41.614
It depends.

08:41.714 --> 08:46.943
I think Adams, they're going to have prints of it.

08:47.044 --> 08:47.485
That's right.

08:47.505 --> 08:53.616
But also, Adams did his own prints, and he did every one differently, so a case could be made that you might want.

08:53.736 --> 08:54.698
Well, that's right.

08:54.718 --> 08:57.844
In that case, I mean, if you could make your case, you could probably see it.

08:57.944 --> 09:00.068
It's sort of like with the treaty that I was telling you about.

09:00.088 --> 09:00.870
You know, it's on microfilm.

09:00.890 --> 09:01.671
They're printed.

09:01.921 --> 09:15.775
But if you have a particular need, a real reason... If you're writing a book and you need to compare and contrast something, that would be the kind of need that we would ask to say yes to it.

09:15.795 --> 09:21.561
Because we know you would need that to actually make your argument with whatever you're doing in the book that you're writing.

09:21.581 --> 09:26.547
I was going to tell you the kind of research that actually uses up here.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.831
I think most of these people who are in here now are doing research for...

09:31.148 --> 09:33.611
documentary films.

09:33.711 --> 09:34.772
Some of them are not.

09:34.912 --> 09:38.817
I think the gentleman over here may be doing research.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.262
I've been doing research in World War II.

09:44.644 --> 09:52.994
We have all kinds of purposes for doing research.

09:53.755 --> 10:01.003
People come up here to look at the photographs we have on the art that was

10:01.355 --> 10:05.040
confiscated or found in World War II.

10:06.683 --> 10:19.161
And people have come up here to do a research on some of the atrocities in World War II.

10:20.170 --> 10:28.020
Do you know your way around?

10:28.220 --> 10:45.722
A little bit.

10:47.440 --> 10:57.235
What we've done in the security area, we have to have a need to get into the back area.

10:57.856 --> 11:07.451
If you don't have the unit that has the left back area trans now, you ought to take it in.

11:07.471 --> 11:11.918
This is the Michael Trump reading room up here.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.983
And this is a self-service room.

11:15.217 --> 11:18.002
And most of the records here are the records that are published on Microphone.

11:18.683 --> 11:20.587
And we have a Microphone publication.

11:20.607 --> 11:28.040
But one of the largest collections we have up here are the records from the Browning Document Center Microphone.

11:28.060 --> 11:37.798
And those records are records about the SS personnel, the German SS personnel.

11:38.065 --> 11:45.795
You can probably return the originals to the Republic of Germany, and in turn they've given us the microfilm back.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.298
That was the deal in doing that.

11:48.759 --> 11:49.720
Those records are here now.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.603
We're getting a lot of interesting.

11:52.284 --> 11:59.533
I think our research in those records has increased because they have a lot of good information on the people who are actually in there.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.136
That's the officers and the listeners.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.398
That's in a lot of the collections.

12:04.711 --> 12:06.233
These are files, by the way.

12:06.254 --> 12:07.616
Are these actual microphones?

12:07.936 --> 12:12.964
Yeah.

12:13.806 --> 12:15.388
These are all kinds of microphones.

12:16.009 --> 12:17.792
Yeah, microphones and microphones.

12:17.812 --> 12:20.677
This depends on the technology.

12:20.777 --> 12:22.780
An individual can't come and take something?

12:22.820 --> 12:24.623
Somebody has to get us for them?

12:24.643 --> 12:25.445
No, yes, they can.

12:25.465 --> 12:28.069
If they use the filing aid,

12:28.673 --> 12:31.216
And then they'll identify what they want.

12:31.236 --> 12:38.005
They will come to the door itself, take it out, and then go to one of the doors.

12:38.026 --> 12:49.301
It's really simple.

12:49.321 --> 12:55.609
The archives are trying to build and have more self-service items in the special archive musical.

12:55.994 --> 13:11.874
I have to turn the motion to send a video on, I think.

13:11.894 --> 13:13.196
All the videos, that's been coming back.

13:13.216 --> 13:18.002
The motion to do research, the former youth here are people that like to move out and lift themselves.

13:19.315 --> 13:44.243
and the news media this is the most specific research room and this is another room that we try to have self-service as much as possible when we make new um recent copies of items we put on video tape now and if there's no um

13:44.830 --> 13:49.477
restrictions through copyright or donor restrictions you put on itself.

13:49.918 --> 14:03.678
This is one of them to come out, okay?

14:03.778 --> 14:14.314
The copy that we have, you know, the films that the federal government would produce or acquire over the years, and the earliest film we have,

14:14.918 --> 14:20.105
It's a donated film from the Edison Collection, Thomas Almond Film Collection.

14:20.966 --> 14:33.584
And we go up to almost, we're about a government film maybe 20 years behind the time except for television news.

14:35.166 --> 14:40.453
And if we have motion picture film, people look at the film in here.

14:41.632 --> 14:48.165
And you can, once again, you can copy right out if it's excessive in public domain and a large part of our system.

14:48.185 --> 14:50.209
Do you have to pay to use the distribution?

14:50.229 --> 14:51.111
No.

14:51.131 --> 14:51.932
It's free.

14:52.253 --> 14:53.295
And you can break your own copy.

14:53.576 --> 14:58.946
So if you're in the news media and you want to come and get it in store, just put it in the news that night.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.992
You're coming, you pull it off the shelf, and then you can copy and get it out of here.

15:02.012 --> 15:03.535
And I don't want to take good time.

15:03.555 --> 15:03.876
Really?

15:04.261 --> 15:15.018
The only thing that happens is that what you're talking about is that it doesn't work as policy.

15:15.078 --> 15:24.392
Right, but they use it on broadcast because they're taking it from the word print.

15:24.793 --> 15:31.163
But we're also making copies that we have in both parties.

15:31.345 --> 15:56.644
What the National Archives does is different from other archives is that we actually allow researchers to have cart or practice anywhere from one box to 24 boxes at a time.

15:58.227 --> 16:16.345
And the research that we'll do, when they're doing textual records, they'll come in and they'll register at the desk all the way over, they'll register there, and then they'll tell us what type of records they're looking for.

16:16.365 --> 16:18.748
They're looking for records that were created by a civilian agency.

16:19.368 --> 16:22.551
We will tell them they have to go down to room 2600 to get expert advice.

16:22.571 --> 16:26.175
If it's a military agency, there's room 2400 to get expert advice.

16:26.797 --> 16:33.784
And we ask researchers to handle records a certain way, like to have one folder out of the box at a time.

16:34.685 --> 16:39.550
And when you copy it and tab everything you're going to copy and bring it up so we can inspect it.

16:39.570 --> 16:48.118
And when we're inspecting documents, we're trying to make sure that the document no longer has the security classification on it, that it's in good condition and can be copied.

16:48.138 --> 16:55.926
If it's in poor condition, the researcher cannot copy it and we have to notify the lab so they can do some type of preservation work too.

16:58.015 --> 17:05.723
You know, a lot of these things are security measures because we don't have an item-by-item control of the stuff in the archives.

17:05.743 --> 17:09.587
So we don't know if something is stolen until it turns up on the open market, generally.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.772
And that's what happened with Charles Merrill Mount and that famous heist of his.

17:14.372 --> 17:16.574
In fact, I got the call on a Friday afternoon.

17:16.695 --> 17:21.119
Some bookseller in Boston called me and said, how would you know if something was taken from the National Archives?

17:21.139 --> 17:23.542
And I was asking if I wouldn't.

17:23.562 --> 17:24.603
Well, that was L.C., was he?

17:24.623 --> 17:26.064
No, he did both.

17:26.265 --> 17:26.605
He did both.

17:27.293 --> 17:34.464
And what he tried to tell to the Boston bookseller was a Civil War document that had Abraham Lincoln's signature.

17:34.484 --> 17:46.602
So when he said, well, you know, I think I have something that belongs to you, I really sort of sat up and took note and passed along to, of course, the appropriate people.

17:47.020 --> 17:53.350
And in fact, those documents had been footnoted in a book, and I think they had been on the microphone.

17:53.370 --> 18:04.908
So then we were able to prove with the microphone and the footnote to a book that those documents had been found in the National Archives, and they were no longer here, and therefore they were ours.

18:04.928 --> 18:07.712
But otherwise, you know— Well, because as you said earlier, you are dealing with unique documents.

18:07.810 --> 18:08.711
That's right.

18:08.731 --> 18:13.056
But, you know, a lot of these documents are unique, but they've never been microcommed, they've never been cited in a book.

18:13.617 --> 18:17.261
So if somebody were to walk out with them, we couldn't really prove that they belonged to us.

18:17.281 --> 18:25.130
So what we have to do is to take measures to prevent this from happening so that we don't get into a situation of having to prove.

18:25.150 --> 18:31.998
So the measures here you have that you hope are much stronger security measures at the source, right?

18:32.359 --> 18:33.560
Exactly.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.923
That's why we have clean research rooms, as does LC.

18:35.943 --> 18:37.665
We don't allow people in our SAC areas

18:37.932 --> 18:39.774
We check people coming in and going out.

18:40.095 --> 18:43.959
Yeah, but now you let people come up here with equipment with bags and stuff?

18:43.979 --> 18:44.139
No.

18:44.239 --> 18:45.161
No, not really.

18:45.181 --> 18:45.941
They don't have bags.

18:46.863 --> 18:51.168
If we had walked through somebody with a bag, I would have actually started to talk in there and take the bag off.

18:51.688 --> 18:57.155
Even the equipment that have pockets to it, they actually take the equipment out of that bag.

18:57.675 --> 18:59.357
So like pockets, you can put documents in.

18:59.778 --> 19:05.104
We get into discussions with a lot of researchers who think that it's okay to have the

19:05.523 --> 19:12.557
the bag with the pocket, and I can explain to them why we don't do that, and they still don't understand.

19:12.578 --> 19:18.229
So we try our best not to have anything that comes to the National Archives to have an enclosure.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.053
No enclosure.

19:20.153 --> 19:21.215
You have to kind of prove it.

19:21.235 --> 19:24.021
You know, and nothing to both of us.

19:24.676 --> 19:31.648
You know, we count ourselves as being very fortunate, because we haven't had any situations like Charles Merle-Mouth since then.

19:31.788 --> 19:41.225
Well, I wrote a book about the great book, Thief of the Twain, and the FBI said, you know, don't fret it if you're a librarian.

19:41.245 --> 19:42.587
This guy is a master thief.

19:43.449 --> 19:49.159
He'll get in, you know.

19:49.179 --> 19:49.279
Okay.

19:49.299 --> 19:49.840
Come on, thank you.

20:03.910 --> 20:20.497
And this is how we keep the film.

20:21.438 --> 20:28.770
We would film an archival site basically as like

20:29.307 --> 20:37.076
You stack them on top of each other, and that's when you go to a library on that side, and that's not the correct way to do it.

20:37.096 --> 20:44.225
So they can go to the side and get all that pressure coming down.

20:44.245 --> 20:45.166
It's all still in here, right?

20:45.186 --> 20:45.387
Nope.

20:46.668 --> 20:50.553
I don't know directly.

20:50.573 --> 20:54.758
You can go down this way, or the same book is down this way.

20:58.957 --> 21:26.705
It's basically all the track areas, including our complex track areas, except that they have a box of those shelves instead of shelves.

21:26.725 --> 21:27.686
So these volumes were prepared to be moved here.

21:27.706 --> 21:28.327
Our conservation lab has these.

21:28.347 --> 21:28.727
And they left them.

21:29.146 --> 21:51.941
They have, um, these volcanoes we call, um, live rocks.

21:51.961 --> 21:55.727
They're beginning to, uh, be composed and what do you call it?

21:56.112 --> 22:00.499
I think it's called weird one.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.183
I think that's the type of term that we call it.

22:03.203 --> 22:14.540
It's not, um, it's not brittle, it's just that... See, we've got a shrink wrap.

22:15.461 --> 22:18.185
It's shrink wrap for movement.

22:18.285 --> 22:23.453
And we leave them here until someone wants to look at them, so actually you can see whether any of these questions or questions they have.

22:23.669 --> 22:35.645
In fact, the move was very beneficial for us because it gave us a greater intellectual control over what we had.

22:35.665 --> 22:44.057
Also, it allowed us to move records around even in the old building so that they could be all together because the building was so overgrown in terms of storage.

22:45.370 --> 23:13.200
that you had, you know, records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records that had records

23:13.822 --> 23:40.669
What did you do to train to be an archivist?

23:40.689 --> 23:40.909
I told you.

23:41.480 --> 23:54.562
For me personally, I have a degree in history and I've taken graduate courses in the public administration at American University and I applied for a job and I was selected.

23:55.243 --> 24:00.191
The most important thing for National Archives is that you have a background in history, especially U.S.

24:00.211 --> 24:00.732
history.

24:01.333 --> 24:05.901
Most of the people here have either advanced degrees or

24:06.775 --> 24:12.703
have worked toward an advanced degree, and the undergraduate degree usually is in history.

24:13.224 --> 24:26.343
An advanced degree may be in history or political science or public administration, but most of the people here are kind of history people.

24:26.583 --> 24:30.909
How about the nips and bolts of the archival process, though?

24:30.929 --> 24:36.377
What do you... Well, we have a training program here, one of the sort of preeminent ones in the country.

24:36.644 --> 24:42.332
We call it our SIDS program, and you can come in as a... What do you call it?

24:42.492 --> 24:44.074
What do you call the program?

24:44.094 --> 24:44.375
SIDS.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.657
It's Career Intern Development.

24:46.257 --> 24:47.940
That's what it stands for.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.323
Career Intern Development.

24:52.566 --> 25:05.284
It's basically an intern system that you get, each year you get different level assignments that prepare you to be able to work as an architect at the full performance level.

25:05.838 --> 25:10.424
I mean, that's how you become an archivist here, really.

25:10.544 --> 25:24.701
First, people have some type of desire to work in history, then they apply for the job as an archivist, and they get selected for this program, and at the end of it, they're considered to be archivists.

25:24.721 --> 25:26.623
Okay, so did you turn your off, basically?

25:26.684 --> 25:28.686
Right, we do, we do.

25:28.706 --> 25:34.393
Just last week, I was at the University of Illinois at their library school, and there aren't that many library schools left, but there are.

25:34.812 --> 25:48.087
Yeah, there's one at the University of Maryland, and we do have people who come to us from the library.

25:48.107 --> 25:48.587
From the library school?

25:48.607 --> 25:50.990
And there are architects who lead here and go and teach at library schools.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.493
And then there are architects who come here from other archival institutions, state archival institutions.

25:53.513 --> 25:55.115
But generally, Calvin is right, they come through the institution here.

25:55.135 --> 25:58.018
And I think at least we used to have more PhDs.

25:59.618 --> 26:02.643
I don't know if that's still true.

26:02.663 --> 26:06.569
I think we rank just below NASA still.

26:06.589 --> 26:09.614
Is that right?

26:09.634 --> 26:14.242
How many people work here?

26:14.302 --> 26:14.783
About 2,800.

26:15.143 --> 26:15.804
Here?

26:15.965 --> 26:16.766
No.

26:16.786 --> 26:17.567
I'm not sure.

26:17.667 --> 26:22.235
We used to have half employees used to come from the Washington D.C.

26:22.255 --> 26:22.535
area.

26:22.676 --> 26:23.196
Yeah, yeah.

26:23.297 --> 26:23.858
Maybe about 800.

26:23.878 --> 26:24.158
I'm not sure.

26:25.184 --> 26:28.110
I still think that we have an educational level.

26:28.130 --> 26:33.541
We have one of the highest educational levels for the other government agencies.

26:34.022 --> 26:43.682
I think that's still true when you look at the total workforce.

26:48.083 --> 27:03.042
We have a large number of teams coming in every day doing Nazi gold research.

27:03.162 --> 27:05.766
We have a lot of government teams that come in, too.

27:05.786 --> 27:07.628
Government teams come in and put them in the aisle.

27:08.309 --> 27:13.776
What kind of documents would you go through if you were interested in Nazi gold?

27:15.138 --> 27:16.960
You'd end up doing research in

27:17.615 --> 27:23.523
The record's produced by the DOD after World War II.

27:23.543 --> 27:23.923
And Treasury?

27:24.264 --> 27:24.744
And Treasury.

27:25.365 --> 27:27.288
And we have a finding aid for that.

27:27.328 --> 27:35.559
Gray Bradshaw, who is the architect that actually deals with that, he has a good finding aid on that.

27:35.619 --> 27:37.441
How do you search that?

27:37.461 --> 27:38.222
About 500 pages.

27:38.776 --> 27:58.626
And there are also, we have our state's department records, I think almost all agencies that work internationally.

27:58.646 --> 28:01.611
You know, some of the organizations that were around on all of this, and we've been cross-eyed, and we've shown our primary efforts for this effort.

28:01.844 --> 28:26.822
some of those figures they get them from over there they um carts are delivered over there how much can you request

28:27.443 --> 28:34.931
24 boxes is what's put on the cart.

28:35.111 --> 28:36.853
That's the most.

28:36.873 --> 28:44.401
There's a holding area in the back where you can store them.

28:44.421 --> 28:45.042
You don't have to request them.

28:45.062 --> 28:45.582
You do or you don't?

28:45.783 --> 28:46.423
No, you do not.

28:46.523 --> 28:50.348
I mean, you request them from the holding area, but they're not reshowed.

28:50.368 --> 28:52.069
You don't have to go through the pool?

28:52.129 --> 28:52.310
No.

28:52.690 --> 28:55.493
We hold them for three days, the last time you've seen them.

28:56.215 --> 29:01.001
The other thing is you can copy anything that you can that's in good condition.

29:03.625 --> 29:14.580
Yes, great.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.803
Terrific.

29:16.843 --> 29:18.645
Very generous of you.

29:23.806 --> 29:26.553
Thank you very much.

29:26.573 --> 29:27.536
You're welcome.

29:27.556 --> 29:34.795
Take care.

29:35.264 --> 30:00.040
How would I do that, do you think?

30:00.307 --> 30:04.716
I don't know.

30:06.198 --> 30:15.156
What I'm going to have to do is leave you with that.

30:15.176 --> 30:16.759
That's great.

30:16.779 --> 30:18.923
Yeah, why don't you call me at some place?

30:19.527 --> 30:25.393
You know, if you don't hear from me for a while, is that because I've lost interest?

30:25.413 --> 30:27.055
That's correct.

30:27.255 --> 30:30.058
I basically have this whole book of research that, you know, I'm writing.

30:30.438 --> 30:31.379
Hi, hi.

30:31.399 --> 30:32.580
How are we here?

30:32.720 --> 30:34.262
We project about a dozen chapters.

30:35.743 --> 30:49.517
And, you know, obviously when you're working on one method, you go quite...

30:51.235 --> 30:59.746
Yeah, it's wonderful.

30:59.766 --> 31:01.769
I have it.

31:01.889 --> 31:03.451
I have it somewhere.

31:04.212 --> 31:08.658
I have a guess.

31:08.678 --> 31:10.140
Can I make a guess?

31:10.160 --> 31:10.341
Yeah.

31:11.322 --> 31:18.291
I mean, the San Francisco public library is up to 150 million.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.373
Could it be close to the day of the day of the night?

31:19.393 --> 31:19.613
Am I close?

31:19.633 --> 31:20.154
You know, I think you are.

31:20.174 --> 31:20.635
I'm going to check you.

31:20.655 --> 31:20.835
Oh, okay.

31:20.855 --> 31:20.955
Yeah.

31:21.526 --> 31:43.990
All right.

31:47.277 --> 32:05.172
Thank you.

32:05.192 --> 32:05.893
Do you want to have to wait for me?

32:06.228 --> 32:21.992
I'm going to say that it's about five minutes now.

32:22.012 --> 32:23.374
I don't know what to do, but do you just direct me to that one hour?

32:23.394 --> 32:24.516
We'll be showing how to get out and make sure we can go.

32:24.536 --> 32:25.257
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:25.277 --> 32:25.998
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:26.018 --> 32:26.739
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:26.760 --> 32:27.481
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:27.501 --> 32:28.222
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:28.242 --> 32:28.963
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:28.983 --> 32:29.704
I don't know if you have to do that.

32:42.442 --> 33:05.012
I'll briefly tell you what I'm working on.

33:05.052 --> 33:07.555
It's a book that's...
