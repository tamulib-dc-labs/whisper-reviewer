00:02.208 --> 00:22.680
I wouldn't even bring this up, but I read in a PW interview that you say, I don't mind if you mention race as a, quote, black mystery writer.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.144
I mean...

00:26.322 --> 00:29.605
Is it pertinent to you to be identified as such?

00:29.625 --> 00:32.288
You said, I don't mind if you... No, it's not pertinent.

00:32.308 --> 00:36.372
I mean, there's a lot of different things that I am, you know, and I don't mind talking about any of them, you know.

00:36.612 --> 00:37.373
I'm a novelist.

00:37.453 --> 00:38.354
I'm a mystery writer.

00:38.394 --> 00:39.835
I'm a black mystery writer, you know.

00:40.476 --> 00:42.157
I'm a lot of different things in soccer.

00:42.177 --> 00:42.718
I don't care.

00:44.099 --> 00:56.211
You know, I mean, it's not... You know, I mean, it's a big thing to easy, my character, that he's black and he's living among black people and...

00:57.119 --> 00:59.482
And it would be a mistake not to recognize that.

00:59.882 --> 01:11.237
And it's not, I mean, it's not like a trick or a vehicle or a hook that I'm using, you know, like, you know, you might have a mystery writer who's a French cook, you know.

01:12.058 --> 01:14.281
We have mystery writers who are French cooks.

01:14.641 --> 01:14.941
Yeah, right.

01:14.962 --> 01:18.206
Well, you know, and like, or the detective is a French cook.

01:18.226 --> 01:21.590
Okay, so like, you know, you want, that might not have much to do.

01:21.710 --> 01:25.675
It might just be a trick that somebody's using, you know, just that little thing.

01:25.958 --> 01:30.143
to give depth or some kind of quirk to their character.

01:30.163 --> 01:32.085
But, I mean, easy being black is not done.

01:32.105 --> 01:33.206
I mean, it's real.

01:33.286 --> 01:35.068
I'm making, like, comments about things.

01:35.168 --> 01:36.590
I take it very seriously.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.192
And I don't mind.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.436
I don't mind when people just talk to me about being, you know, just a novelist.

01:41.516 --> 01:42.257
You write fiction.

01:42.377 --> 01:44.879
But, yeah, because I'm very interested in fiction.

01:44.900 --> 01:45.861
We will get to that.

01:46.181 --> 01:53.950
But I think certainly being an African-American, African-American writer is one element, one level.

01:54.010 --> 01:55.932
But the world that you write about

01:56.840 --> 02:00.143
certainly involves people of color.

02:00.724 --> 02:09.812
And you are certainly trying to profile it, I guess, if not explain that world, but certainly use it as your... Yeah, it's the world of my character.

02:09.832 --> 02:11.213
It's the world of your character.

02:11.233 --> 02:11.514
Yeah.

02:11.534 --> 02:14.997
It's very hard to write fiction that doesn't have some kind of base like that in it.

02:16.298 --> 02:25.226
Are you trying... The piece in today's times, for instance, congratulations, that's a nice... Yeah, it is nice.

02:25.306 --> 02:25.707
I like that.

02:25.727 --> 02:26.087
Yeah, that's nice.

02:26.692 --> 02:32.539
The lead is, well, he really doesn't live in L.A.

02:32.599 --> 02:33.100
anymore.

02:34.141 --> 02:35.323
You live in New York.

02:35.983 --> 02:40.309
Talk about this dichotomy, if you will, a bit for me.

02:40.329 --> 02:40.509
L.A.

02:40.569 --> 02:44.274
is certainly the city of your imagination, and it's the city of your youth.

02:45.235 --> 02:47.097
But why not write about...

02:47.583 --> 02:49.946
You know, New York, why L.A.?

02:49.966 --> 02:55.314
Well, you know, my next novel is about half of it occurs in New York, which is not an easy book.

02:55.354 --> 02:56.716
It's another kind of book.

02:56.736 --> 02:57.697
I was going to say.

02:57.717 --> 02:58.819
It could be by Easy Rawlins.

02:58.879 --> 02:59.980
Easy Rawlins wouldn't be in New York.

03:00.121 --> 03:01.683
I don't think he'll ever go to New York.

03:02.985 --> 03:11.937
But Easy does, you know, he does live in, I mean, Easy lives in L.A., and that's what I write about.

03:13.081 --> 03:14.263
I can write about any place.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.304
I write about L.A.

03:15.364 --> 03:20.791
You know, when I start writing, the first things I wrote were about the Deep South, because those are my first memories, even though I never lived there.

03:21.312 --> 03:36.051
They're my first memories, because everybody I knew used to tell stories about, you know, Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas, and southern Louisiana, and plantations, and farms, and sharecropping, and music, and parties, and, you know, and on and on and on, that kind of life.

03:36.723 --> 03:47.563
And the first book I wrote, Gone Fishing, was actually about that, which nobody published because it wasn't a mystery, and it was about young black men, and nobody really knew how to, like, commercialize it, or so they thought.

03:48.324 --> 03:50.047
That remains an unpublished work?

03:50.127 --> 03:51.310
It remains unpublished.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.912
So it will be published, though it's just not yet.

03:53.534 --> 03:59.845
Now, so, I mean, I don't...

04:01.343 --> 04:02.926
I don't really see it as a dichotomy.

04:02.946 --> 04:04.789
I live in New York because I like living in New York.

04:04.929 --> 04:05.910
I love the West Village.

04:05.930 --> 04:06.932
I think it's a great place.

04:09.396 --> 04:14.985
People live, like I said in the article, you have all kinds of people right together.

04:15.146 --> 04:17.630
It's a very rich texture of a city.

04:18.231 --> 04:22.197
And unlike most American cities, people are not removed from it.

04:22.217 --> 04:23.419
They don't live in the suburbs.

04:23.669 --> 04:26.892
As a rule, they don't live in their cars.

04:27.213 --> 04:30.396
In order to go anyplace, you have to go down and get in the street.

04:30.416 --> 04:32.258
That's the only way to get places.

04:32.278 --> 04:37.243
You know, either you take subways or taxis or buses or you walk, and that's the way you get around in New York.

04:37.263 --> 04:38.304
And I love that.

04:38.524 --> 04:39.666
I love New York.

04:40.126 --> 04:41.187
I love New York.

04:41.628 --> 04:42.829
Of course, it's easy up here.

04:42.889 --> 04:49.095
Bostonians test New York for reasons that have no... Well, it's deep in the history.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.036
It's dumb.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.579
I mean, every time I go there, I love it more and more.

04:53.048 --> 04:54.130
What a great place.

04:54.771 --> 05:03.865
And also, as an adjunct to what you're saying, you go to a city like Detroit, Detroit is dying, it's dead because everything has moved out of the suburbs.

05:03.885 --> 05:04.747
Everything's gone away, yeah.

05:05.508 --> 05:08.232
And even those who come into work, I mean, it's gone.

05:08.653 --> 05:13.080
And once they start putting the jobs out there, forget it.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.185
You're leaving these poor people just to die in a dying town.

05:16.205 --> 05:17.407
And that's so true.

05:17.547 --> 05:17.908
And you know,

05:18.125 --> 05:20.368
And this is true of most American cities.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.088
I'm on tour now.

05:21.109 --> 05:21.990
I'm going to all these cities.

05:22.010 --> 05:22.971
I can't even remember.

05:23.311 --> 05:25.494
I've been to some and it's hard to remember which is which.

05:25.574 --> 05:30.420
But most cities downtown are just big buildings with kind of windows like this.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.043
There's no businesses.

05:33.643 --> 05:34.745
There's no real life in the city.

05:34.765 --> 05:35.305
People aren't walking.

05:35.325 --> 05:37.167
And there is no life after 5 or 6.

05:37.187 --> 05:37.768
After 6.

05:38.449 --> 05:38.990
People are gone.

05:39.650 --> 05:43.575
And all the lunch stands are closed.

05:43.724 --> 05:44.805
I don't like living like that.

05:44.825 --> 05:46.326
I don't like driving particularly.

05:46.587 --> 05:48.508
I do like Los Angeles a lot when I go there.

05:48.528 --> 05:48.809
I like L.A.

05:48.869 --> 05:49.970
I was just out two weeks ago.

05:49.990 --> 05:50.890
I love L.A.

05:50.910 --> 05:54.073
But, you know, it's not where I live, though.

05:54.093 --> 05:56.035
You know, I live in New York, but I write about L.A.

05:56.135 --> 05:56.515
I go to L.A.

05:56.555 --> 05:57.136
all the time.

05:57.216 --> 05:57.756
I know L.A.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.499
very well, and, you know, it's in my heart.

06:00.539 --> 06:01.600
So is New York, you know.

06:02.160 --> 06:12.109
You said in that same interview, not the Times one, but the PW interview, that EZ accepts that there is no justice in the world.

06:12.950 --> 06:13.090
Mm-hmm.

06:13.475 --> 06:14.977
Is that your feeling?

06:15.037 --> 06:22.446
Well, not that there's no justice in the world, but that it's not clear-cut.

06:23.287 --> 06:26.491
Easy's world, and most people's world, it's just not clear-cut.

06:27.412 --> 06:30.315
If you're going to get a fair shake, you have to kind of work with it.

06:30.415 --> 06:32.318
You kind of have to work through it a little bit.

06:32.438 --> 06:32.758
I do.

06:33.159 --> 06:33.859
Easy did more.

06:33.919 --> 06:34.841
My parents did more.

06:34.881 --> 06:36.883
My parents' generation and their parents' generation.

06:37.150 --> 07:05.149
did more things aren't exactly fair you can't exactly one of the things i explain i talk about mouse uh my uh my sociopathic character and i say people often ask me when i do readings they say well you know why is he why are you seeing my friends and i go well if you're in middle class and you live in a middle class neighborhood your friends are people that you go out with that maybe you share babysitting with the worst thing you do maybe you have to borrow a couple of bucks sometimes right uh and he

07:05.787 --> 07:19.723
In Easy's world, Mouse, who's the hero of that world rather than Easy, really, if Easy comes running up to Mouse's house and says, they're after me, Mouse will reach, you know, right over somewhere and come out with his gun.

07:20.563 --> 07:24.588
If you went to your middle-class friend's house, they would say, I'll call 911.

07:24.848 --> 07:25.789
You say, you don't understand.

07:25.809 --> 07:27.631
There's just half a block down there.

07:27.651 --> 07:28.692
911 is not going to help.

07:28.753 --> 07:32.757
But, you know, that's the different kind of life.

07:32.956 --> 07:36.840
I think that that's a life that... Maybe the middle class guy is going to grab his gun now.

07:37.140 --> 07:40.324
Well, things are actually changing, but still not that much.

07:40.664 --> 07:45.609
Still, you know, if you live... People try to live in a place where they feel comfortable.

07:45.629 --> 07:49.033
People are always bragging, you know, when they're living in a place where I don't have to lock the doors.

07:49.373 --> 07:49.734
Wonderful.

07:49.754 --> 07:50.955
You don't have to lock the doors where you live.

07:50.975 --> 07:51.375
That's great.

07:51.455 --> 07:52.617
I want to live in a place like that.

07:52.637 --> 07:53.237
That's bullshit.

07:53.317 --> 07:54.118
You've got to lock your door.

07:54.138 --> 07:55.840
Well, there are people who don't, though.

07:56.261 --> 07:58.643
But, you know, but you see, that's not how I...

08:00.682 --> 08:03.165
That's not how easy lives.

08:03.365 --> 08:05.508
That's not how a lot of people today live.

08:05.548 --> 08:07.531
A lot of people today live under great pressure.

08:07.551 --> 08:11.977
A lot of people of color and then poor whites in America, they live under a great deal of pressure.

08:11.997 --> 08:13.739
They don't feel like they get a fair shake.

08:13.779 --> 08:16.062
The bureaucracy doesn't give them a fair shake.

08:16.082 --> 08:21.109
People who don't like them because they're black or because they're women or because they're poor don't give them a fair shake.

08:21.149 --> 08:26.115
People have pre-assumptions about who you are and what you are and what you did.

08:26.213 --> 08:30.600
There was a great story in Manhattan about 10 or 12 years ago.

08:30.620 --> 08:33.665
A guy, you know, a black guy, jumps to the turnstops.

08:34.186 --> 08:35.728
His name is like Joe Jackson.

08:35.748 --> 08:36.089
Who knows?

08:36.129 --> 08:37.571
I don't know what his name is, but let's say it's that.

08:38.673 --> 08:47.828
Some guy named Joe Jackson had murdered somebody and been a drug dealer and done all these things and was on bail and jumped bail and didn't come in for sentencing because he'd been found guilty.

08:48.208 --> 08:48.990
They said, well, you're him.

08:49.691 --> 08:49.791
Yeah.

08:50.092 --> 08:51.474
And he said, no, I'm not him.

08:51.514 --> 08:53.216
Just take, you know, take my fingerprints.

08:53.356 --> 08:53.857
I'm not him.

08:54.037 --> 08:55.840
But, you know, he kind of looked like the guy.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.864
You know, he maybe had a scar somewhat similar to his or something.

08:58.884 --> 09:00.506
They never took his fingerprints.

09:00.586 --> 09:02.108
He was in Rikers for six months.

09:02.549 --> 09:03.029
Jesus Christ.

09:03.230 --> 09:04.592
He was like, you know.

09:04.612 --> 09:05.433
That's a real story?

09:05.453 --> 09:06.174
That's a real story.

09:06.214 --> 09:09.638
Yeah, this happened, I don't know, ten years ago.

09:09.658 --> 09:10.379
It was in Manhattan.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.821
And they forgot about him, sure.

09:11.981 --> 09:13.383
Well, even his lawyer.

09:13.564 --> 09:16.047
The only reason they found him, this really was very funny, I remember.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.010
They probably found the real Joe Jackson.

09:18.030 --> 09:18.230
No.

09:18.250 --> 09:18.310
No.

09:18.813 --> 09:21.337
He was coming to the trial for sentencing.

09:21.357 --> 09:23.260
You know, because, you know, it takes forever in New York.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.221
He's like months in jail.

09:24.682 --> 09:26.745
I'm sorry to laugh, but that's a funny story.

09:26.785 --> 09:28.167
They take him up for sentencing.

09:28.728 --> 09:32.253
And the prosecutor, because the defender was a different guy.

09:32.273 --> 09:33.234
The prosecutor isn't the guy, right?

09:33.254 --> 09:37.120
The prosecutor, who just happened to be the same guy who had been prosecuting, I guess, you know.

09:37.220 --> 09:38.342
One of these courts.

09:38.362 --> 09:40.144
You know what?

09:40.164 --> 09:41.226
This isn't Joe Jackson.

09:41.527 --> 09:42.488
They go, what are you talking about?

09:42.508 --> 09:43.530
Yeah, this is Joe Jackson.

09:43.550 --> 09:43.930
No, no, no.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.332
I remember Joe Jackson.

09:45.592 --> 09:46.654
He gave me a look.

09:46.714 --> 09:47.455
I won't ever forget.

09:47.675 --> 09:48.736
You know, whatever it was.

09:49.097 --> 09:50.258
And they let him go.

09:50.379 --> 09:56.026
And this is like... So he did six months for jumping a turnstile.

09:56.046 --> 09:56.266
Right.

09:56.286 --> 09:59.150
And damn nearer got sent off to Attica or something.

09:59.170 --> 10:00.131
It could have been like in prison.

10:00.151 --> 10:02.274
It could have been in the Attica riot.

10:02.655 --> 10:08.082
He couldn't get the defense lawyer to believe him enough to go through the amount of work.

10:08.102 --> 10:09.243
Because, you know, there's a great deal of work.

10:09.263 --> 10:09.964
When you're in Riker's,

10:10.163 --> 10:11.546
It's great real work to do anything.

10:12.809 --> 10:15.214
HBO had that special on, right?

10:15.254 --> 10:17.298
That was really very interesting.

10:17.318 --> 10:26.898
The guy who was coming up for a trial, he had to go 32 times down to the court in order just to get them to say, no, you can't.

10:26.938 --> 10:28.662
We're not going to let you out.

10:29.435 --> 10:30.937
You know, so they didn't want to do that.

10:31.138 --> 10:37.307
So when you talk about a fair shake, you know, I mean, if, again, if you live in that middle-class America, things like this don't seem possible.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.231
They say, well, they could just take your finger and say, yeah, if they will.

10:40.271 --> 10:41.272
So, well, they have to do that.

10:41.713 --> 10:42.755
Well, no, they don't.

10:43.095 --> 10:45.218
They don't have to do anything, you know?

10:45.238 --> 10:47.902
Well, let's talk, you know, I'm amused, by the way.

10:47.922 --> 10:51.347
The people who write some of these stories must be 25 or something.

10:51.407 --> 10:54.192
They say that how you came to this late at the age of 30.

10:54.412 --> 10:54.832
I'm 51.

10:54.973 --> 10:58.478
I'm publishing my first book this spring, you know.

10:58.498 --> 10:58.598
Yeah.

10:58.865 --> 11:05.251
I'm amused that you came to this at the end of the 30s.

11:05.271 --> 11:06.291
In my mid-30s.

11:06.331 --> 11:07.513
It's kind of ridiculous.

11:07.573 --> 11:10.475
Which is kind of the perfect time to become a writer, it seems to me.

11:11.476 --> 11:14.859
But prior to that, you were a computer guy.

11:15.199 --> 11:16.801
I was a programmer for a long time.

11:17.541 --> 11:18.922
And this was in Manhattan?

11:19.343 --> 11:20.103
Well, various places.

11:20.384 --> 11:21.104
First in Vermont.

11:21.124 --> 11:22.586
I lived in Vermont for six or seven years.

11:23.887 --> 11:25.648
Then in Boston and then in New York.

11:25.668 --> 11:26.329
So you've been around.

11:27.570 --> 11:27.690
Yeah.

11:28.936 --> 11:31.821
Tell me then where Easy came from.

11:31.841 --> 11:37.471
I mean, I guess you were banging around the computer and I worked for it all of a sudden.

11:37.491 --> 11:37.811
Yeah, right.

11:37.832 --> 11:38.533
I just started typing.

11:38.613 --> 11:39.575
It wasn't Easy then.

11:39.595 --> 11:40.136
Did he appear?

11:40.276 --> 11:42.760
I mean, was he conjured out of the cosmos?

11:43.341 --> 11:43.562
Yeah, yeah.

11:43.582 --> 11:45.926
But pretty much basically I was just writing about him.

11:45.946 --> 11:51.315
And I draw a lot on people I've known, my parents, my family, my friends and stuff.

11:51.650 --> 11:53.071
But, you know, he just kind of came up.

11:53.111 --> 11:53.872
Did you see him?

11:53.892 --> 11:55.053
I mean, do you have a picture?

11:55.073 --> 11:57.856
No, I've never had a picture of him, which is the funny thing about the movie stuff.

11:57.876 --> 11:58.697
People get upset at me.

11:58.717 --> 12:03.061
They go, well, what is he, you know, who's going to be the movie?

12:03.081 --> 12:04.383
And I go, Denzel Washington.

12:04.403 --> 12:06.585
He goes, oh, no, he doesn't look like Easy.

12:06.905 --> 12:08.747
And I go, oh, you know.

12:08.767 --> 12:10.008
What does he look like?

12:10.348 --> 12:12.651
You know, what I do is for Easy.

12:12.731 --> 12:18.096
I have, you know, like I really like talking about people, drawing them, seeing what they look like and stuff.

12:18.245 --> 12:22.851
But easy, you know, he's the kind of guy who doesn't think about what he looks like.

12:23.531 --> 12:25.754
He doesn't, you know, he's just one of those guys.

12:25.794 --> 12:28.958
He comes from a kind of background where that's less important.

12:29.018 --> 12:29.559
It's irrelevant.

12:29.599 --> 12:30.420
Right.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.044
Yeah, it's irrelevant, basically, because life is so hard.

12:34.124 --> 12:35.045
It has been so hard for him.

12:35.065 --> 12:36.327
So, well, you know, so is he handsome.

12:36.347 --> 12:37.488
I don't know if he's handsome.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.230
After I hit him, he's not going to be so handsome.

12:39.250 --> 12:44.637
But the idea, and, you know, and people don't talk to him about what he looks like.

12:44.757 --> 12:47.340
I mean, who, you know, because, you know, that conceit, you know, when,

12:47.590 --> 12:55.039
You know, when people first start to write and they don't quite know what writing's about, and they're writing a first-person thing and say, well, I passed a mirror.

12:55.459 --> 12:59.604
And I looked at myself, finely chiseled features with a broad Roman nose.

12:59.624 --> 13:00.765
That's funny.

13:02.127 --> 13:05.191
So I don't really know what he looks like, but I know what he feels like.

13:05.231 --> 13:06.652
Oh, that's good.

13:06.672 --> 13:08.535
But you really don't have a picture of him.

13:08.555 --> 13:08.615
No.

13:08.935 --> 13:10.517
I know he's over six feet tall.

13:10.537 --> 13:11.438
Can you hear his voice?

13:11.806 --> 13:12.246
Yeah.

13:12.987 --> 13:14.649
Because he does certainly have a voice.

13:14.669 --> 13:15.169
Yeah.

13:15.189 --> 13:17.731
His voice is like, he has a nice tenor voice.

13:18.332 --> 13:20.274
His voice is, and I know who he is.

13:20.334 --> 13:22.656
I know what he feels like, what he talks like.

13:23.217 --> 13:28.982
I know his, like, inner fears and his inner kind of, like, that's what I know about him, you know.

13:29.382 --> 13:36.649
I know that he's not arrogant, but, you know, confident of himself physically, you know, in the world.

13:36.989 --> 13:38.451
Not necessarily that he thinks he's beautiful.

13:38.471 --> 13:40.372
He doesn't really think about that, but he thinks he's strong.

13:40.392 --> 13:41.053
He can fight.

13:41.236 --> 13:44.119
And, of course, he finds often enough that they're wrong enough.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.582
Do you know the Andy Vox character, the guy?

13:46.662 --> 13:47.884
Oh, sure, Burke.

13:48.084 --> 13:49.766
Yeah.

13:49.786 --> 13:57.275
People often wonder if maybe this is an extension of Andrew, you know.

13:57.295 --> 14:04.643
But he certainly is interested in the things he's interested in, and I guess he takes his rage and his concerns to the next step.

14:04.663 --> 14:07.307
Is he an extension of you in that respect?

14:07.327 --> 14:08.368
Not exactly.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.230
Not exactly.

14:10.733 --> 14:19.261
For me, Easy is a character who represents a world that I'm very interested in and that I love very much.

14:19.281 --> 14:20.022
I love that world.

14:20.062 --> 14:24.085
Maybe if you could just define it a bit.

14:24.105 --> 14:29.290
Yeah, well, you know, it's kind of the world of my father and his life.

14:30.031 --> 14:39.019
His story, which I felt like I know so well, and I was surprised one day to find that not everybody else in the world knows this story about, you know,

14:39.202 --> 14:49.014
poor, black, rural people from, you know, deep down in Louisiana and Texas who, you know, kind of came up just, I mean, barely.

14:49.975 --> 14:52.919
Survival was an amazing thing growing up.

14:52.939 --> 15:07.456
And then having this amazing series of events happen to him, going off into World War II, fighting, realizing all of a sudden, you know, my father used to tell me, he said, when he went to war, he thought he wasn't worried about it.

15:07.476 --> 15:07.977
He said, because

15:08.193 --> 15:13.299
If the Germans came, he would just throw down his gun and say, I'm sorry, I'm not American, I'm a Negro.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.522
I'm just a nigger.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.288
But he realized, no, they were shooting at me too.

15:21.628 --> 15:26.874
And then after a while he realized that the French and the English liked him.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.758
They were happy because he was coming there to liberate them.

15:30.923 --> 15:35.229
And that he was... Why did Josephine Baker like it so much in Paris?

15:35.249 --> 15:36.871
Yeah, well, you know, that's the whole thing.

15:36.891 --> 15:39.275
Of course, she was at a point where she could decide to go.

15:39.295 --> 15:45.043
My father, it was just like, you know, come on, boy, we're going over to war, you know.

15:45.163 --> 15:48.427
And then, you know, then coming back and then migrating up to the north.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.150
So it's a story that I know.

15:50.210 --> 15:56.839
It's like a story of my people, my family, my relatives, my friends that... Passed on as a royal tradition.

15:57.300 --> 15:57.420
Right.

15:57.552 --> 16:26.783
and you say it's my memory but it's the memory of what is not what you've experienced but what you've been told but you know that's the whole thing about being human memory you know experiencing things and knowing things it's a really blurry line in between those things and they really intermingle a whole lot I think so you started in your 30s and you're working at the word processor and easy appears I mean is it that

16:27.168 --> 16:31.974
organic, or did you really think about this?

16:32.054 --> 16:36.079
I did the thinking, but I did the thinking after I'd come up with the character.

16:37.060 --> 16:49.435
The novels are me thinking through this, and if you look at them, I mean, it really is, you can see very big shifts, and not in who he is, but, you know, how I'm working on articulating his life.

16:49.455 --> 16:51.978
Not just his life, but what you're doing, I guess, with the form.

16:51.998 --> 16:54.542
Right, the whole, you know, the whole thing.

16:54.562 --> 16:56.584
Now, according to a few, and I read the

16:57.070 --> 16:58.933
That was quite a good press kit, by the way.

16:58.953 --> 17:00.977
They really do send a lot of good articles.

17:03.462 --> 17:14.742
But you really do think of yourself as a fiction writer, and it pisses you off a tad to be

17:15.363 --> 17:18.368
to be categorized as a genre writer.

17:18.448 --> 17:19.991
And believe me, I respect that.

17:20.051 --> 17:28.124
I mean, if Bob Parker lives, you know, half a mile from where we sit now, is he writing novels or is he writing, you know, mystery novels?

17:28.144 --> 17:29.166
I mean, P.D.

17:29.246 --> 17:34.695
James is writing absolutely, you know, novels that are taken very seriously as literature.

17:34.815 --> 17:37.519
But just address yourself to that, maybe.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.521
Well, you know, it's interesting.

17:38.541 --> 17:39.683
You know, there are...

17:40.861 --> 17:43.124
I don't mind somebody saying I'm a mystery writer.

17:43.184 --> 17:45.667
I mean, that doesn't bother me all by itself.

17:45.707 --> 17:47.309
It tends to dismiss what you're doing.

17:47.349 --> 17:58.942
Right, but they do it in a way, often people do it in a way, there's a dispense of people who say, you know, I was talking to one, I was sitting with a couple of writers, and one of them said, oh, you don't know Walter, he writes great books.

17:58.962 --> 18:03.207
You know, I read his books, and then all of a sudden he got nervous and went, well, you know, I read them on the beach.

18:04.132 --> 18:06.396
I looked at him and said, well, you can read them in your house.

18:06.416 --> 18:06.937
It's all right.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.480
You can read them in the fall.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.125
It's okay.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.347
But then he reiterated.

18:12.407 --> 18:14.090
I was on vacation.

18:14.110 --> 18:15.312
He had a qualifier.

18:15.332 --> 18:15.633
Right.

18:15.713 --> 18:17.416
And that is what I don't like to take.

18:17.536 --> 18:19.560
To take the thing and say, well, this is vacation literature.

18:19.580 --> 18:20.181
It's not serious.

18:20.561 --> 18:22.545
I think I'm writing some of them.

18:23.217 --> 18:26.221
equally as serious as any other piece of literature coming out today.

18:26.241 --> 18:33.892
Well, listen, I took Elizabeth Bishop's letters on a vacation, which I prefer to read when you have the time to enjoy what you're reading.

18:33.912 --> 18:41.042
When I finally do take my vacation, I'm going to read Langston Hughes, Bell Hooks, and Albert Einstein.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.687
This is where I'm going to read when I go on vacation in August.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.408
I don't understand.

18:45.448 --> 18:46.209
I don't understand.

18:46.629 --> 18:47.451
That's what I don't like.

18:47.471 --> 18:50.335
I don't like when people say, well, this isn't literature.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.077
This isn't, you know, this is...

18:52.765 --> 18:53.806
This is your playing now.

18:53.826 --> 18:55.207
When are you going to write something serious?

18:55.327 --> 18:59.151
Admittedly, however, you do have conventions that you have to observe.

18:59.351 --> 19:00.072
Absolutely.

19:00.092 --> 19:00.973
But everybody does.

19:00.993 --> 19:09.121
There are rules of the game, and you have to give the reader a fair shot at figuring it out, and there are things that have to be done.

19:09.141 --> 19:09.441
Agreed.

19:09.501 --> 19:13.665
There are conventions to the genre that I follow, more or less.

19:14.666 --> 19:20.612
I expect, however, at some point,

19:21.470 --> 19:25.256
you're 42, you're going to want to start growing as a writer.

19:25.656 --> 19:28.020
Well, my next book is going to be this thing called R.L.'

19:28.000 --> 19:31.906
's Dream, which is, for lack of a better term, a blues novel.

19:31.926 --> 19:35.131
It's a novel about an old blues singer living in New York who's dying.

19:36.353 --> 19:39.217
And he once, when he was a young man, played with Robert Johnson.

19:39.237 --> 19:43.264
And he's remembering Robert Johnson.

19:43.404 --> 19:44.826
And I like this book a lot.

19:44.866 --> 19:49.333
I think that I have a lot of broader range in the book of

19:49.718 --> 19:57.248
Fictionally, because I'm not using a first-person narrative, but a third person, I'm changing from different characters through the book.

19:58.270 --> 20:01.594
See, you're lucky you have a good publisher that will allow you to do that.

20:02.956 --> 20:14.612
Eventually, at Random House, the contract says every book's got to be about a shark or a squid or something like that.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.022
It's got to be in the ocean.

20:17.103 --> 20:25.996
Well, you know, but you know, you could say, if you said that to Melville, he'd say, okay, I'll write about a whale.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.719
You know, you can do it.

20:28.119 --> 20:32.766
Well, what I'm saying is Random House... Yeah, they want to make their money on it.

20:32.786 --> 20:33.567
He's a property.

20:33.948 --> 20:36.972
He's a property, and you've got a guy like...

20:37.559 --> 20:39.321
Well, Edna B. Cannon was there.

20:39.521 --> 20:43.146
She's the Bulletin Prize-winning crime reporter from the Miami Herald.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.869
When she decided she wanted to do a novel, she's gone.

20:45.889 --> 20:47.311
They cut her loose.

20:47.671 --> 20:48.032
Really?

20:48.052 --> 20:50.174
Yeah, she's in Hyperion.

20:50.194 --> 20:51.996
She's in her last three books with Hyperion.

20:53.398 --> 20:55.861
But wait, who cut her loose?

20:55.881 --> 20:56.442
Random House.

20:56.462 --> 20:57.523
Oh, Random House.

20:58.304 --> 20:59.786
Oh, when she wanted to do the mystery.

21:00.146 --> 21:00.787
Oh, I see.

21:00.847 --> 21:01.828
The paper was loose.

21:02.078 --> 21:03.519
No, no, no, no, no.

21:03.539 --> 21:04.220
I was going, huh?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.702
No, no, no, no.

21:05.722 --> 21:06.743
She left.

21:06.763 --> 21:08.344
No, no, it's a big problem.

21:09.325 --> 21:18.154
But they are allowing you to write a blues novel where, in fact, you know, your celebrity and your following is being established.

21:18.534 --> 21:20.196
A nice house like Martin can do that.

21:20.677 --> 21:23.700
But, you know, like, I mean, I don't, there's a few things.

21:23.780 --> 21:28.204
Number one, listen, if you're with most of the people who do mysteries, that's all they know how to do.

21:28.336 --> 21:30.859
Even if you say you wanted to write a different book.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.402
You may be the only mystery writer on the list.

21:34.925 --> 21:36.788
There's two that they have.

21:36.808 --> 21:38.430
I forgot his name.

21:38.530 --> 21:39.131
I don't know why.

21:39.151 --> 21:41.234
He's a poet.

21:41.254 --> 21:43.697
And he wrote the Saratoga Mystery.

21:44.238 --> 21:46.321
I don't know.

21:46.341 --> 21:50.186
But, yeah, I'm very happy with Norton.

21:50.206 --> 21:54.512
Of course, the money that they're going to put behind me isn't...

21:55.606 --> 21:57.248
These books are sold.

21:57.268 --> 21:58.449
They've made a market for themselves.

21:58.769 --> 21:59.290
So R.L.'

21:59.270 --> 22:01.031
's Dream is going to be a smaller book.

22:01.792 --> 22:02.873
Give me the title once more.

22:02.893 --> 22:05.956
R.L.'

22:05.936 --> 22:06.717
's Dream.

22:06.897 --> 22:07.198
R.L.'

22:07.178 --> 22:07.878
's Dream.

22:08.439 --> 22:09.940
I'm very happy with that.

22:09.980 --> 22:14.205
I'm really happy when I get back to working on it.

22:14.305 --> 22:19.590
This is the first time I haven't been able to work on tour because I'm doing a lot of stuff.

22:19.630 --> 22:23.374
Do you write on a computer?

22:23.734 --> 22:25.596
Yeah, I write on a computer.

22:25.711 --> 22:26.312
Which I have it.

22:26.332 --> 22:26.812
I haven't used it.

22:26.832 --> 22:28.114
Three days I've been able to.

22:28.274 --> 22:30.897
Yes, Dr. Rojo was sitting right there half an hour ago.

22:30.957 --> 22:34.321
He's now writing on a computer, which stuns the hell out of me.

22:34.341 --> 22:41.309
You know, I thought he was all... He's a very progressive fellow that yelled Dr. Rojo.

22:41.329 --> 22:41.429
Yeah.

22:41.449 --> 22:42.350
Anyway, where are we going?

22:43.932 --> 22:48.257
This is irrelevant, but I understand that you have a comic book collection?

22:48.557 --> 22:49.899
Oh, yes.

22:49.919 --> 22:51.921
I just wrote a book about bibliomania.

22:52.508 --> 22:53.009
Yeah.

22:53.269 --> 22:53.749
Madness.

22:54.010 --> 22:56.432
I wish I'd met you a couple of years ago.

22:56.553 --> 22:57.253
So you should have.

22:57.694 --> 23:00.717
I've collected comic books ever since I was 12.

23:00.737 --> 23:03.541
But I don't have a comic book collection in my book.

23:03.561 --> 23:04.682
Tell me about it a bit.

23:04.702 --> 23:05.803
Maybe I'll get it in.

23:06.224 --> 23:11.650
When I was a kid, there's an interesting thing.

23:11.870 --> 23:19.579
Young boys, I think it's girls to a lesser degree, but young boys definitely, when they start going through those hormonal changes,

23:19.880 --> 23:25.168
They're kind of violent changes, and they affect the way boys think.

23:25.188 --> 23:30.615
But, of course, young kids are very intelligent, and they learn very quickly, and they want to learn.

23:30.635 --> 23:34.100
But it's just that they're governed by these forces going on in them.

23:34.921 --> 23:37.305
I look back now, and I understand that.

23:37.325 --> 23:40.930
The comic books really dealt with that kind of stuff for me.

23:41.711 --> 23:45.837
All these things, like you would have characters like the Submariner, who is this guy.

23:46.087 --> 23:52.615
who's half human and half, you know, like this merman kind of stuff.

23:52.635 --> 23:55.559
He's kind of like that, but he's like, he's like a hero villain.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.004
I mean, there's an amphibian in the novel.

23:59.785 --> 24:01.086
I'm sorry, go ahead.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.168
But yeah, I figured.

24:02.568 --> 24:11.981
But for me, when I was a kid, I'd be reading this and I'd love this guy because he's a hero for his people down under the sea, but he's a villain for us up over the land.

24:12.361 --> 24:15.385
And the whole concept of having like ambivalence, like, you know,

24:15.550 --> 24:18.895
be doing things that are bad, but for good reasons, all this other stuff.

24:19.156 --> 24:33.478
The kind of stuff that kids think about all the time, that no other form of literature, I mean, you can read The Scarlet Letter, but it's hard to grab onto it because it doesn't have that kind of dynamic stuff that kids want, like, you know, violence and flying and rays and all this other stuff.

24:33.498 --> 24:35.361
And so when I was a kid, I read them all the time.

24:35.381 --> 24:36.042
It's just religious.

24:36.102 --> 24:42.232
I'd go by my comic book and sit down and read these comic books, which is just... At what point did you get collecting them, though?

24:42.252 --> 24:42.773
Well,

24:42.888 --> 24:44.569
From the beginning, I did.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.452
Are you a collector?

24:47.492 --> 24:48.413
Is it innate in you?

24:48.873 --> 24:49.614
No, no.

24:49.734 --> 24:52.856
I don't collect anything except for I have these comic books.

24:52.877 --> 24:56.580
So you don't have an obsessive quality to you?

24:57.420 --> 25:02.004
Collecting, I buy the comic books and I put them in plastic bags and I keep them.

25:02.605 --> 25:03.405
I do that.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.167
To this day?

25:05.187 --> 25:05.387
Yeah.

25:05.507 --> 25:06.508
Did you read them first?

25:07.149 --> 25:07.969
Some of them.

25:08.029 --> 25:08.950
Some of them, some of them not.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.251
So you're a collector then?

25:10.271 --> 25:10.832
I collect them.

25:10.852 --> 25:12.253
If you buy them and don't read them,

25:12.520 --> 25:14.282
If you buy them to keep them, you're a collector.

25:14.302 --> 25:18.345
Well, but for me, you can't separate it.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.067
Number one, I don't care if they get messed up.

25:20.087 --> 25:22.409
So that kind of removes me from collector.

25:22.429 --> 25:23.971
You know, because some people will buy it.

25:24.912 --> 25:28.235
Condition is important.

25:28.255 --> 25:29.376
So I don't do that.

25:29.936 --> 25:33.440
And I read, but like a lot of, like half the ones I buy, I read.

25:33.520 --> 25:39.085
Some of them, either I'm not interested in them right now, or I'm interested in an ARC or whatever.

25:39.638 --> 25:40.759
But I am a collector.

25:40.779 --> 25:43.062
Do you get any kind of nourishment out of them?

25:43.082 --> 25:54.136
Oh, God, there's a... I think that I'm still kind of... Actually, DC and I have been dickering around about writing a graphic novel for their comic book, The Vision, which I'm probably going to do next year when I have some comics.

25:54.777 --> 25:57.640
But I read this comic book the other day.

25:57.660 --> 26:02.787
I wrote an article for it for the Village Boys, where there's the Hulk.

26:02.887 --> 26:04.309
You know, he's one of the big comic book characters.

26:04.329 --> 26:08.734
The Hulk has had two different partners, an old partner, Jim, and a new partner, Rick.

26:09.102 --> 26:12.407
Actually, Rick is really old, but he came back in.

26:12.427 --> 26:16.473
Jim, they find out a black kid is in a halfway house for people with AIDS.

26:17.234 --> 26:18.836
You know, like a support house.

26:19.918 --> 26:20.499
And he has AIDS.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.845
And the help comes down, he's supposed to do this thing, and there's this super villain.

26:25.446 --> 26:31.434
It's very complex, but it works out where they address every major issue about AIDS.

26:31.454 --> 26:38.805
Having AIDS, taking care of people with AIDS, protecting people with AIDS because people hate them irrationally.

26:39.545 --> 26:42.508
blood, transferring blood, they got that in there.

26:42.888 --> 26:45.531
And at the very end, the Hulk and Rick are having this conversation.

26:45.551 --> 26:49.615
And Rick says, well, how do you think that Jim got AIDS?

26:50.957 --> 26:53.820
And Hulk looks at him and goes, well, it doesn't matter how he got AIDS.

26:54.320 --> 26:59.666
What matters is he's our friend and he's sick and we have to help him.

26:59.686 --> 27:06.953
And, you know, I read this comment and I said, you know, this is like really good because, you know, this is how you can talk to a 12-year-old about AIDS.

27:07.253 --> 27:15.125
You can't make an adult comic book and say, oh, John almost did drugs or almost had sex.

27:15.165 --> 27:16.387
You just can't do it.

27:16.908 --> 27:23.017
You have to address it in a way that kids are interested for another reason, for reading.

27:23.037 --> 27:25.601
But to engage them first as entertainment, I guess.

27:26.141 --> 27:29.026
Which is the same thing, I think, about my own work.

27:29.066 --> 27:31.810
I was just about to seg you into that.

27:32.363 --> 27:34.406
My own work is the same kind of thing.

27:34.506 --> 27:36.088
I think that, you know, along with E.M.

27:36.108 --> 27:39.272
Forrester, that the most important thing about a novel is the story.

27:39.673 --> 27:41.215
The story is, well, what happens next?

27:41.415 --> 27:42.316
Turning the page.

27:42.877 --> 27:54.092
And being committed to the world that you're writing about, loving it, really wanting to write about it, but also remembering that if you want other people to read it, it has to be a story.

27:54.112 --> 27:54.793
It has to be interesting.

27:54.813 --> 27:58.558
It has to be something about it that engages the reader.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.620
Don't mean a thing if it ain't got this way.

28:00.660 --> 28:01.101
That's right.

28:01.181 --> 28:01.822
Absolutely.

28:01.842 --> 28:01.982
I know.

28:02.367 --> 28:06.832
I really believe that, and I believe in all kinds of art forms.

28:06.892 --> 28:16.241
It's easy to start to become snooty about art.

28:16.261 --> 28:17.602
But art isn't a snooty thing.

28:17.823 --> 28:19.364
Art is entertainment.

28:19.424 --> 28:20.125
Art is fun.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.827
Art is satisfying.

28:21.887 --> 28:23.448
It drives violence.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.350
Human expression is what it is.

28:25.370 --> 28:29.134
It's all the basic stuff.

28:29.890 --> 28:33.555
But you did, before I interrupted, you did say, I am a collector.

28:33.996 --> 28:35.538
And I just wonder if you could finish that.

28:36.059 --> 28:36.880
Well, no, I collect this.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.604
I mean, I don't even know what to say because a collector.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.307
What's the purpose of the collection?

28:42.428 --> 28:43.169
Like it's 6,000.

28:43.450 --> 28:44.431
Well, you know, I started.

28:44.732 --> 28:47.015
You see, one of the things is I started doing it.

28:47.576 --> 28:53.805
And, like, I really kind of keep feeling that if I just stopped, then one day I'd be sad about it.

28:55.006 --> 28:56.969
If I just stopped, one day I would be sad.

28:56.989 --> 28:59.593
I would miss something about it, you know.

28:59.962 --> 29:01.844
And so I just keep doing it.

29:02.965 --> 29:06.809
Do you buy old and rare comic books?

29:06.829 --> 29:07.490
No, not really.

29:07.550 --> 29:08.611
It's too much money.

29:08.631 --> 29:09.012
Not really.

29:09.032 --> 29:10.453
It's like being just a little pregnant.

29:11.094 --> 29:11.294
No.

29:11.394 --> 29:12.235
Well, no, I don't.

29:12.535 --> 29:14.297
Let me say it like this.

29:14.317 --> 29:21.805
When I say not really, every once I think about it, like last night I was on television, Sotheby's is auctioning off the old comics.

29:21.845 --> 29:22.406
Big money.

29:22.426 --> 29:24.889
Batman 1 and Superman 1 go for $25,000 to $30,000.

29:26.410 --> 29:27.632
It wouldn't be a bad investment.

29:27.652 --> 29:28.973
I thought about it for about...

29:29.948 --> 29:55.247
10 seconds and i thought it's not 10 seconds it's a lot of thought it's not worth it it's not worth it superman number one because because seven thousand because the condition because the condition doesn't matter to me because the condition of superman number one as a thing is not worth sixty seven thousand dollars or it's not worth it's not i wouldn't i wouldn't spend a thousand dollars

29:55.565 --> 29:59.911
Well, I mean, Wayne Gretzky paid a half a million dollars for a baseball card.

30:00.872 --> 30:01.373
I don't get it.

30:01.733 --> 30:02.374
I don't get it either.

30:02.514 --> 30:03.115
I don't get it.

30:03.135 --> 30:03.576
That's ridiculous.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.979
I mean, if you really love it.

30:05.999 --> 30:08.763
These are, by definition, ephemeral items.

30:08.783 --> 30:09.564
This is ephemera.

30:10.885 --> 30:12.708
Yeah, it's not like the Mona Lisa.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.111
You know, it's not like Modigliani.

30:15.251 --> 30:17.794
I could see buying a painting.

30:18.956 --> 30:21.960
And I have bought paintings that I like.

30:22.750 --> 30:26.474
And, you know, because of one piece of work, you know, it's like done.

30:26.574 --> 30:31.359
It's really, it really means something all by itself, singularly in the world.

30:31.479 --> 30:35.003
I can see collecting that on some kind of high level.

30:35.383 --> 30:38.506
But, you know, comic books are, like you say, ephemera.

30:38.806 --> 30:40.408
You have goals for yourself, I guess.

30:42.670 --> 30:50.498
It would please you when all is said and done to be ranked and considered with the crates of the genre.

30:50.699 --> 30:51.019
Oh, yeah.

30:51.235 --> 30:54.238
Talk to me about that.

30:54.258 --> 30:57.641
Well, you know, I'm in there.

30:58.081 --> 30:59.122
Do you read them, by the way?

30:59.182 --> 31:00.463
I've read all of them.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.264
I've read all the greats.

31:01.884 --> 31:04.046
I mean, I haven't read some of the people.

31:04.106 --> 31:06.208
But, you know, there are a lot of people who are just wonderful.

31:06.888 --> 31:14.175
The guys in America, Chandler Hammett, McDonald, later Charles Williford, who I just think is brilliant.

31:14.715 --> 31:15.556
He is excellent.

31:15.716 --> 31:16.517
I'm sorry he died.

31:17.538 --> 31:19.639
He's such a great writer.

31:19.659 --> 31:20.280
Isn't he a little cockfighter?

31:21.037 --> 31:22.339
Jeff Wilford?

31:22.359 --> 31:23.521
Was he down in Florida?

31:23.741 --> 31:23.941
Yeah.

31:23.961 --> 31:24.622
I haven't read that.

31:24.642 --> 31:26.525
I reviewed that when I first started reviewing.

31:26.545 --> 31:27.226
It wasn't a mystery.

31:27.266 --> 31:28.148
It was just a novel.

31:28.348 --> 31:30.090
Wonderful, about cockfighting.

31:30.110 --> 31:30.872
Spectacular.

31:30.892 --> 31:32.093
His writing is so good.

31:32.113 --> 31:37.001
It's just like, you know, I just, I just, it's just, you read it and it's just funny.

31:37.141 --> 31:40.646
It's like, and you know, with anybody who can make you laugh, Sam doesn't simply choose Parker.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.429
He has a great ability to make you laugh.

31:43.570 --> 31:47.737
Tim and James Lee Burke, you know, you can say anything you want about genre.

31:47.757 --> 31:48.698
I mean, uh,

31:49.505 --> 31:53.251
This guy's a novelist who can't write about any damn thing he wants.

31:53.531 --> 31:54.853
No, it's true.

31:55.374 --> 31:57.237
And I'm sure I'm being introduced to you now.

31:57.257 --> 32:00.562
I have to confess, you know, I write about authors all the time.

32:00.582 --> 32:02.425
I can't say I've read the shelf on Mosley.

32:03.266 --> 32:05.269
That's right.

32:05.489 --> 32:10.837
But once I get into a person and I like them, then I inevitably do.

32:11.859 --> 32:14.503
All right, like I read all of Rick Stout and all of someone else.

32:14.523 --> 32:16.626
It took me years, you know.

32:17.112 --> 32:19.875
But how do you see yourself developing as a writer?

32:20.216 --> 32:20.776
How do you mean that?

32:21.377 --> 32:24.961
Developing as a, you know, maturing, developing, changing.

32:25.241 --> 32:25.602
I don't know.

32:26.223 --> 32:26.563
I don't know.

32:26.583 --> 32:28.545
Otherwise it becomes stale.

32:28.906 --> 32:31.589
Yeah, well, it can't be the same stuff.

32:31.629 --> 32:38.817
You know, part of the thing that I have for this series is I don't, I age easily, and each book is, you know,

32:39.151 --> 32:41.634
somewhat older, though I'm going to spend a while in the 60s.

32:41.654 --> 32:43.236
I'm going to start it from the age of 28.

32:43.296 --> 32:46.901
I'm going to go up to the age of 75, 76, whatever.

32:47.001 --> 32:49.584
So that's one way that... So he will age with you?

32:49.745 --> 32:50.225
Yeah.

32:50.265 --> 32:52.268
In real time or three quarters?

32:52.288 --> 32:53.129
In real time.

32:53.189 --> 32:53.730
A lot less.

32:53.810 --> 32:57.735
I think I'll probably be finished with the series in 10 to 12 years.

32:58.616 --> 33:04.083
Oh, so at that point you will have, you will be developing into... I'll be like, I'll be 50-something.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.125
Yeah, but I mean, you'll be writing other things.

33:06.386 --> 33:06.846
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:06.926 --> 33:07.968
I'll be writing other stuff.

33:08.248 --> 33:08.989
You know, I'll be

33:09.222 --> 33:10.483
There's a lot of stuff I want to do.

33:10.824 --> 33:20.693
As a writer itself, I'm so interested in it because one thing that I love about doing work that you love, that you grow by doing the work.

33:21.254 --> 33:31.324
If you really are interested in the work and you're interested in how it's going to develop and where it's going to go, you just grow and the work changes and grows.

33:31.524 --> 33:34.126
So where I'll end up, I don't know.

33:34.547 --> 33:35.888
Who I'll be, I don't know.

33:36.020 --> 33:41.026
I expect to have some footing in the genre, whatever that is.

33:41.466 --> 33:45.291
But I also expect to go into many other aspects of writing.

33:45.531 --> 33:48.354
This thing of writing about the blues is another aspect of black life.

33:48.475 --> 33:53.440
I think that the blues is the 20th century idea of tragedy.

33:54.321 --> 33:57.145
And so I'm talking about that in this book.

33:57.826 --> 33:59.968
In other books, I'll be doing other stuff like that.

34:01.045 --> 34:05.992
Is this a longer novel, say, than the blues novel?

34:06.072 --> 34:07.434
It's very hard to tell.

34:07.474 --> 34:08.515
It's very hard to tell.

34:08.555 --> 34:11.279
This book is 80,000 words.

34:11.539 --> 34:14.403
The blues novel won't be more than 100,000.

34:14.924 --> 34:18.389
It might be less than 8,000.

34:19.430 --> 34:20.792
Writing long books...

34:21.278 --> 34:22.720
There has to be a good reason for it.

34:22.740 --> 34:24.322
There used to be a good reason for it.

34:24.342 --> 34:26.725
My book is 255,000 books.

34:26.945 --> 34:28.227
My God.

34:28.247 --> 34:29.288
Well, it's nonfiction.

34:29.429 --> 34:30.871
What can I tell you?

34:30.991 --> 34:31.892
Oh, yeah.

34:31.972 --> 34:33.194
I covered 2,500 years.

34:33.254 --> 34:34.936
How can you not write that?

34:34.956 --> 34:36.097
No, but that's the point, though.

34:36.137 --> 34:44.188
I mean, I think that, like, when people were writing novels at the beginning of the century and into the last century, they had a lot of work to do.

34:44.228 --> 34:46.611
They had to talk about, you know,

34:47.350 --> 34:51.774
places that people had never been, people that they had never met, thoughts that they had never had.

34:52.134 --> 34:55.778
And there were no competing distractions either for the reader's time.

34:55.858 --> 34:56.498
Sure, well, there's that.

34:56.999 --> 34:59.501
But also those distractions also fill in that thing.

34:59.521 --> 35:14.455
Like, you know, if you want to know about the Himalayas, probably if that's a reason that you're going to read something, you might do just as well to look at a National Geographic special on the Himalayas.

35:14.485 --> 35:20.812
But if you're writing about a character in the Hamalayas, really you're talking about the character themselves and how they're developing, how they relate.

35:20.832 --> 35:21.793
And that's shorter work.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.275
It's more condensation.

35:23.475 --> 35:27.399
See, why is it that I can't read James Michener with pleasure?

35:27.419 --> 35:29.241
Because for precisely that reason.

35:29.562 --> 35:35.428
If I want to go to Hawaii, Hawaii, go there.

35:35.448 --> 35:37.010
Or know the history of Hawaii.

35:37.030 --> 35:37.690
It's interesting.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.092
I respect him.

35:39.342 --> 35:47.070
tremendously, but he doesn't engage me as a writer of fiction.

35:47.250 --> 35:55.279
I like The Godfather, a big old rambly book, and I like going through all that stuff because the history is more personal history.

35:55.299 --> 35:57.381
It's not the kind of history you're going to go read somewhere.

35:57.901 --> 36:04.048
It's not the history of Sicily, but it's the history of a family, a mafia family from Sicily to New York.

36:04.408 --> 36:07.932
I could slow down for something like that.

36:09.110 --> 36:30.747
Yeah, I've been told many times.

36:31.688 --> 36:32.029
Really?

36:32.212 --> 36:35.038
And everybody tells me that you're distributed everywhere.

36:35.358 --> 36:36.340
No kidding.

36:36.761 --> 36:37.803
I'm doing it myself.

36:38.665 --> 36:40.829
Entrepreneurially, if there's such a word.

36:42.472 --> 36:47.723
But I got myself a... What are the vital signs for you?

36:47.783 --> 36:49.807
What do you hear from readers?

36:49.827 --> 36:52.412
And does it influence what you're doing?

36:52.432 --> 36:53.815
Well, you know...

36:54.014 --> 36:54.755
That's interesting.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.757
I hear a lot from readers.

36:56.797 --> 37:02.622
Mainly, I don't... And then as a corollary, pardon me, but do you have a picture of who your reader is?

37:03.523 --> 37:03.804
No.

37:03.944 --> 37:06.666
I mean, I do, but it's a very broad readership.

37:06.747 --> 37:09.669
It's in three distinct categories, I think.

37:09.689 --> 37:17.597
There are the mystery readers, which is a very broad range of people, from bricklayers to physicists.

37:18.578 --> 37:22.502
The other day, somebody was like, I've got a book, and I was signing a book for this long-haired guy, and somebody said,

37:22.786 --> 37:27.232
This guy was one of the foremost geneticists, like in the country.

37:27.453 --> 37:31.278
But, like, I didn't know this guy on a bicycle.

37:31.298 --> 37:33.882
But, like, I'm signing his book, you know, and he's reading it.

37:33.902 --> 37:35.444
You know, and then, you know, just all kinds of other people.

37:35.464 --> 37:36.466
That's in the mystery world.

37:36.826 --> 37:49.705
Then there's a world of black people, the African-Americans, who, you know, are kind of hungry to hear or to be corroborated in their knowledge of that oral history that we were talking about, who come and, you know, just talk about it and say, yeah, I had...

37:49.786 --> 38:12.705
parents like that or i'm like that or i'm interested in that that kind of people and then the kind of a general literary audience i i have you know i've been developing uh over this period of time people who read it on the beach and then they take it back to their house and read it you know you had a terrific paperback sale of course which uh which cuts across all yeah right yeah that that you know that's the whole thing that paperback is doing very well and

38:12.888 --> 38:17.313
So, you know, that's going really good.

38:18.053 --> 38:24.240
And, you know, but, you know, also, you know, interestingly, just something else, at the ABA.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.722
Did you go to the ABA?

38:26.742 --> 38:28.144
Yeah, I was there.

38:28.444 --> 38:29.425
I was there a lot.

38:29.445 --> 38:36.812
But one of the things, on June 5th, on the Sunday, I had a little article in the book review.

38:37.413 --> 38:37.934
It was page two.

38:38.194 --> 38:40.036
It was an article about racism and publishing.

38:40.056 --> 38:41.217
The TVR or the LA Times?

38:41.817 --> 38:42.338
LA Times.

38:43.060 --> 38:47.484
it was about racism and publishing.

38:47.504 --> 38:50.147
Because, you know, you have the publishing world, but there are no people of color in it.

38:50.307 --> 38:52.029
A few black people, and then nobody else.

38:52.089 --> 38:54.891
Like, no Puerto Ricans, no, you know, Native Americans.

38:54.911 --> 38:57.334
Very few Asians, which is kind of surprising to me.

38:57.354 --> 38:58.495
But all these people, they're just not there.

38:58.935 --> 39:00.036
And I did write an article about it.

39:00.056 --> 39:05.441
It just said, you know, it's an aspect of liberal passive racism.

39:05.922 --> 39:07.163
And I think it was a good article.

39:07.243 --> 39:10.266
Because I don't think I said anything that was untrue.

39:10.600 --> 39:15.686
or anything anybody could call a liar could argue with, which I think is the big thing about journalism when you do it.

39:16.367 --> 39:20.773
Because if anybody can negate one moment of it, then they can negate everything that you said.

39:21.414 --> 39:23.877
And so I was very happy with the writing.

39:23.937 --> 39:26.740
And I don't really see it much different than any other kind of writing I do.

39:27.061 --> 39:32.187
And it was wonderful because maybe 40 or 50 people came up to me and said thanks.

39:32.352 --> 39:33.073
Isn't that great?

39:33.093 --> 39:36.296
He just said, thanks for writing that, because we want to see the truth out there.

39:36.316 --> 39:38.379
It is the payoff of journalism, by the way.

39:38.679 --> 39:39.500
It is immediate.

39:39.900 --> 39:52.754
The response is, a buddy of mine who's a writer and also a former jazz musician, he said, the thing about performing on the stage is that you hear it immediately.

39:52.975 --> 39:57.320
If they've enjoyed what you've done, the applause is there.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.503
But when you're writing, it can be two or three years before

40:00.685 --> 40:02.107
There's any kind of a sense.

40:02.407 --> 40:03.809
Or if you live that long.

40:03.989 --> 40:05.671
Or if you live that long.

40:05.691 --> 40:08.174
Herman Melville, one of the people.

40:08.194 --> 40:08.694
Exactly.

40:10.476 --> 40:10.957
Okay.

40:11.337 --> 40:13.480
Well, I think we've got a pretty good little interview here.

40:13.620 --> 40:13.860
All right.

40:14.141 --> 40:16.944
If you give me an address, I'll be pleased to send you some copies.

40:17.104 --> 40:18.286
37 Carmine Street.

40:18.306 --> 40:19.127
C-A-R-M-I-N-E?

40:20.028 --> 40:20.288
Yeah.

40:20.308 --> 40:20.688
10014.

40:20.708 --> 40:24.613
10014.

40:24.753 --> 40:27.216
Okay, good.
