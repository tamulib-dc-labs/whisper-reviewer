00:03.271 --> 00:06.976
If I look at the glass, you'll see that it's what's called pound glass.

00:07.016 --> 00:10.200
It's been spun out on a disc and then cut to the square.

00:10.681 --> 00:11.943
So can you see if you look at that?

00:12.103 --> 00:13.224
I notice it indeed.

00:13.565 --> 00:14.366
That's wonderful.

00:15.688 --> 00:18.291
So you'll see that the system is exceedingly efficient.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.962
How long have you been here, Doctor?

00:27.063 --> 00:32.130
I've been a fellow at the College of Anderson.

00:32.515 --> 00:40.002
and deputy librarian for 12 years, and I think I've been librarian for nine years.

00:40.523 --> 00:41.744
Do you enjoy the library?

00:42.204 --> 00:42.865
Oh, very much so.

00:42.885 --> 00:47.690
I mean, it's really the reason why I'm here.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.432
You say you have people, you have scholars coming in all the time.

00:51.614 --> 00:53.335
What are they essentially looking for?

00:53.836 --> 00:55.277
Well, it could be anything.

00:56.058 --> 00:56.719
It could be anything.

00:57.259 --> 01:01.223
Anything in those areas that Pepys was interested in.

01:02.266 --> 01:05.349
I mean, clearly, he had... Well, I'll show you.

01:05.709 --> 01:09.333
I'll leave this in a moment, and I'll show you.

01:09.353 --> 01:11.334
What is under this case, by the way, just briefly?

01:12.015 --> 01:12.596
Which one?

01:12.696 --> 01:13.617
Well, I'll show you.

01:13.957 --> 01:14.878
I'm sorry.

01:14.898 --> 01:15.478
Oh, OK.

01:15.498 --> 01:21.844
And obviously, we do get people working on the diary.

01:21.884 --> 01:24.747
There is the diary, there's the first page, and there's the last page.

01:24.767 --> 01:30.332
You can see that his eyes were getting... He was having trouble with his eyes, and because the...

01:31.308 --> 01:32.970
the signal have got so much bigger.

01:33.852 --> 01:46.951
So this is the final page of the last one, and thus ends all that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my own eyes in the keeping of my journal, J-O-U-R-N-A-L-L-P-L 1841, the diary.

01:47.352 --> 01:49.835
And this basically gives you an overview.

01:49.855 --> 01:56.505
Well, there's the first page, and you see, it starts on the 1st of January, not just any other day, but on the 1st day of

01:56.907 --> 02:24.045
year which peeps was uniquely placed to see was going to be momentous january 1 18 1659 1660 really 59 because of the old style so he and he was so precise he put both years 59 60. yes no that was because was that the fashion no no no because new year's day was april 6 because england was still on the on on the old calendar but he

02:26.472 --> 02:28.215
and starts on the 1st of January.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.877
That's wonderful.

02:29.897 --> 02:44.700
And that is the manual of shorthand, Shelton's Tachygraphy, and T-A-C-H-Y-G-R-A-P-H-Y, Thomas Shelton, London, 1642, the system of shorthand used in the diary, PL-14.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.804
And that's the volume of John Smith's transcription.

02:49.026 --> 02:50.909
John Smith is just behind you.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.692
He was the character.

02:54.034 --> 02:55.416
He was the first transcriber.

02:56.020 --> 02:59.844
And he didn't realize that the key to the shorthand was in the library.

03:00.544 --> 03:01.345
Isn't that extraordinary.

03:01.405 --> 03:08.252
Reverend John Smith, 1798, 1870, from 1819 to 1822, while an undergraduate was there.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.195
He first transcribed the diary while an undergraduate at St.

03:11.215 --> 03:11.835
John's College.

03:12.716 --> 03:14.878
So he did it all for the first principles.

03:14.898 --> 03:16.160
What is this here?

03:16.340 --> 03:17.201
It's a book stamp.

03:17.221 --> 03:19.062
It's long.

03:19.082 --> 03:20.223
Of course, 1939.

03:20.344 --> 03:24.808
If you're looking at a folio, you need something for the... I see.

03:24.828 --> 03:25.909
That's for...

03:26.885 --> 03:32.851
So anyway, you can also see here that his shorthand of speed was different from his shorthand in the diary.

03:32.871 --> 03:38.817
Now this is the account of Charles II's escape from the Battle of Worcester, where he hid in the Royal Oak.

03:39.658 --> 03:52.351
And this was taken down by Peaks from dictation by Charles at Newmarket, where Charles used to go for the racing, but it must have been a rainy afternoon and no racing.

03:52.371 --> 03:55.474
So Charles told his most famous anecdote.

03:56.247 --> 03:59.910
Charles' anecdote, PL 2141.

04:00.051 --> 04:03.514
And Pepys wrote it down in shorthand.

04:03.534 --> 04:10.621
And so you see the shorthand dictation speed is very different from the diary.

04:11.401 --> 04:12.102
That is neat.

04:12.222 --> 04:13.563
This is hurried.

04:14.104 --> 04:21.331
But of course... This is one published book, which was published in 1690.

04:22.472 --> 04:26.035
And it's a defense of his conduct with the Navy.

04:26.251 --> 04:32.399
Memo, M-E-M-O-I, O-I-A-L-E-S, Memoirs Relating to the State of the Royal Navy.

04:32.419 --> 04:36.945
Pepys' Single Book, PL 1143, December 1688.

04:36.965 --> 04:40.089
Is it signed by Pepys, by the way?

04:40.109 --> 04:42.372
It's signed by somebody, you know?

04:42.392 --> 04:43.814
Licensed by somebody else.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.717
But, well, it has his book point in it.

04:46.618 --> 04:47.599
And it's his copy, right?

04:47.619 --> 04:48.601
That must be his copy.

04:49.061 --> 04:50.783
It's the license, no, it's the license.

04:51.184 --> 04:52.065
Yes, it's his copy.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.849
But it's the copy which had the licensing on it.

04:54.869 --> 04:55.009
Mm-hmm.

04:55.647 --> 04:59.270
That's, I mean, those are the two signatures of the people responsible for licensing books.

05:00.031 --> 05:06.276
This, and he planned, the book that he planned and never wrote, was his History of the Neighbour.

05:07.377 --> 05:08.478
Would have been a wonderful book.

05:08.498 --> 05:11.321
Which explains the richness of naval material as well.

05:11.821 --> 05:23.271
That is the first edition of Newton's Principia, which has Pepys' name on the title page, because he was president of the Royal Society when it was published.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.372
That's quite a thing for that.

05:26.140 --> 05:39.560
And it's a demonstration about the library, really, because people sometimes say to me, OK, well, it's self-porting books, but isn't this the bookshelf where you put all the books which you want to impress your friends with?

05:39.580 --> 05:55.303
And it's not, because Pepys couldn't have understood the mathematics of the African champion, but he knew exactly what its importance was, and his contemporaries knew that he realised that, because they would never have elected for the president of the Royal Society

05:55.739 --> 06:25.088
twice the only man ever to have been here twice if they didn't realize that he had this the feeling that civil servants administration genius sometimes have or who can do a thing how it can be done without being able to do it themselves but on the whole what he says is rigidly kept to in the library you see he could speak spanish probably his best language well french as well afterwards wife was french um spanish

06:25.658 --> 06:33.027
French, he understood some German, rather oddly he didn't seem to understand, he must have understood some Italian.

06:34.148 --> 06:37.512
Latin, well enough to be used as a Latin interpreter.

06:40.696 --> 06:41.036
Greek.

06:47.264 --> 06:55.193
So, Greek.

06:56.607 --> 07:03.857
And, indeed, he was very anxious to encourage teaching people, gave Greek books as old schools and halls.

07:07.381 --> 07:10.706
However, there's one respect in which he breaks, in which he's not very done.

07:10.866 --> 07:17.334
There are some books in languages that couldn't be, usually just one book.

07:17.675 --> 07:23.863
For instance, there is this, which is, oh, what is that?

07:24.198 --> 07:26.221
Book of Divination, Divine Nation.

07:26.241 --> 07:26.862
Well, it's I Ching.

07:28.164 --> 07:30.688
In fact, I mean, you were still in print.

07:30.708 --> 07:31.970
You can buy it in paperback today.

07:34.714 --> 07:41.244
And this is because he wanted to have one book in every known script.

07:41.264 --> 07:42.927
He was fascinated by scripts.

07:46.012 --> 07:49.497
And his collecting of early printing was for a purpose.

07:50.725 --> 07:52.667
which I will show you in a moment.

07:52.687 --> 07:54.449
This is the book collector at work, by the way.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.031
No, no, it's not.

07:56.571 --> 07:57.552
I think it is.

07:57.613 --> 07:58.714
No, no, no, hang on.

07:58.754 --> 08:00.536
Don't have to spend, please.

08:00.836 --> 08:06.983
There is something completely extraordinary about this.

08:07.824 --> 08:09.706
Oh, yes, you see that, I'm sure.

08:09.766 --> 08:19.176
That's an artist's model book containing animal figure and architectural studies, about 1400, probably English, P.L.

08:19.216 --> 08:20.057
1916.

08:20.527 --> 08:21.949
They're just wonderful pictures of hers.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.010
Absolutely fantastic, yes.

08:23.651 --> 08:25.814
It's absolutely, absolutely extraordinary.

08:25.834 --> 08:30.380
And then you see, at the same time, that, and then a book of recipes.

08:32.102 --> 08:32.483
Uh-huh.

08:32.783 --> 08:33.003
Cures.

08:33.324 --> 08:34.385
Cures and recipes.

08:34.545 --> 08:38.330
Well, yes, yes, but you never find recipes in the 17th century without finding cures.

08:38.350 --> 08:42.075
I would defy you to find me a 17th century recipe book, which doesn't have medicines as well.

08:42.816 --> 08:45.960
And that's late 15th century English, TL1047.

08:47.502 --> 08:49.605
Now, see, this is the mind of the man who wrote the diaries.

08:50.041 --> 08:56.328
in which he records all of the things we wouldn't know about if he hadn't written them down and about what people were having for dinner, that kind of thing.

08:58.411 --> 08:58.991
Go ahead, sir.

08:59.011 --> 09:02.215
I'm just waiting in magic and exorcisms, which is interesting, too.

09:02.896 --> 09:05.980
He was fascinated by books of spells, though he wasn't himself superstitious.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.101
He was very curious.

09:07.121 --> 09:07.642
This is one.

09:08.142 --> 09:08.783
He used to read them.

09:08.823 --> 09:10.305
Those are his ideas of white reading.

09:14.389 --> 09:16.572
There's one of the volumes of the Ballot section.

09:17.581 --> 09:29.174
Now, this demonstrates a way in which he doesn't fit into any modern conception, really, of a poor collector, because his assiduous collecting is ephemera.

09:29.334 --> 09:33.519
The ballads, and the penny godlinesses, and the penny merriments.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.842
These are ephemeral items of the period.

09:35.942 --> 09:40.868
Yeah, he was sold at fars, low, penny, apony.

09:40.888 --> 09:47.335
Ballads one, and a five-volume collection of broadside ballads, including many early examples, PL2005.

09:48.108 --> 09:49.309
The large too.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.250
Yes.

09:50.270 --> 09:50.350
Yes.

09:50.370 --> 09:51.832
Well, they're all to that side.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.876
They've been cut down, actually.

09:55.896 --> 10:00.740
So he was thinking, this is where there are an extraordinary number of so-called unique writers.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.841
The complete cook.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.423
Yes.

10:03.443 --> 10:04.384
P-L-E-A-T.

10:05.044 --> 10:07.767
Penny merriments and godliness.

10:07.787 --> 10:12.732
Chapbooks sold at fairs and by street vendors on a wide range of secular and sacred subjects.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.014
P-L-362,365.

10:16.195 --> 10:17.997
Bulgaria IV IV.

10:18.500 --> 10:25.107
books for the popular market, often abridgments of old stories and extensively embellished with woodcuts, PL1103.

10:29.091 --> 10:30.032
A fascinating man.

10:30.052 --> 10:35.938
Do you feel you know the man by having custody or responsibility for his library?

10:36.358 --> 10:45.688
I do, yes, I think it's, I certainly know, I think I know his author as far as his, as far as his, but no one doesn't know him because

10:46.495 --> 10:51.742
You know him extraordinary well through the diary, you know him through this, but then there was a whole of his public career.

10:52.563 --> 10:56.128
And his public career was perhaps, for his contemporaries, the most remarkable thing about him.

10:57.089 --> 11:02.977
I mean, it's very interesting that he was obviously in terrible political trouble at the revolution.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.361
He wasn't thrown out of his avauntologies.

11:08.384 --> 11:09.705
He was in the tar for a period.

11:09.745 --> 11:14.832
They had to put him in the tar, because he was the right-hand man of the Stuarts.

11:15.233 --> 11:17.877
in the most important arm of government, which was the Navy.

11:19.298 --> 11:33.417
Now, what I'm saying about is not fitting the Navy pack, but I think it's very easy to put in an immediate frame and put in a kind of vise-like grip.

11:33.557 --> 11:35.560
Is this an elephant folio, would you say?

11:36.441 --> 11:40.126
Yes, I mean, it's his largest.

11:40.146 --> 11:40.887
But here we have

11:41.963 --> 11:51.457
Now, as of all of his collections, his algorithms, meticulously laid out with this margentine, he had no idea he did that for him.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.260
And it is definitely called a collection.

11:54.121 --> 11:57.666
My calligraphical collection, volume one.

11:59.229 --> 12:11.447
Comprehending as well the original proofs of the handwriting of the ancient and several ages within the late thousand years and the competition for mastery between the librarians and printers upon the first break and forth of the latter.

12:11.714 --> 12:13.156
Librarians are scribes.

12:13.476 --> 12:14.597
Breaking out of the letter.

12:14.657 --> 12:15.739
Breaking out of the letter.

12:15.799 --> 12:16.440
L-A-T-T-E-R.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.782
Oh, sorry.

12:18.882 --> 12:31.057
The librarians are the scribes, and the apprentice of the prentice, as the performances of all celebrated mass.

12:31.337 --> 12:32.639
Which is 1700.

12:35.302 --> 12:39.467
Now you see, again, it's meticulously indexed.

12:39.487 --> 12:40.708
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

12:41.380 --> 13:08.569
um kind of details which other people just weren't recording but it's such such as well it's easier to show you on the print section where he records as well as the name of the of the painter he records the name of the engraver he records the name of the publisher which we find which we find very important today yes but people weren't doing this in the 70th century um the place of publication um

13:11.097 --> 13:14.541
Now, this is really an extraordinary volume.

13:14.561 --> 13:20.307
Yes, but this is what I mean about not being a modern detective.

13:20.327 --> 13:28.216
He was engaged in a scientific study of writing and the transformation of writing from script to print.

13:29.638 --> 13:39.889
So, here we have examples of early writing, groups of ancient handwriting, is what you may call it.

13:41.152 --> 13:44.755
I'm just thinking of this as you speak.

13:44.775 --> 13:55.485
Arranging chronological orders, orders, sorry, with commentaries on them by Humphrey Wormley, who was, of course, the Harleian librarian.

13:56.106 --> 13:58.007
I think there's a book out there about him now.

13:58.448 --> 13:59.449
Yes, there is, yes.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.611
And his diary has been published as well.

14:01.711 --> 14:04.974
Do you know the title of the book on Humphrey Wormley, by the way?

14:04.994 --> 14:05.414
Yes.

14:05.995 --> 14:06.335
Okay.

14:07.896 --> 14:09.758
I didn't remember the publisher, which is annoying, but I...

14:10.075 --> 14:11.337
Who's the publisher?

14:11.357 --> 14:11.798
DAWSN?

14:12.499 --> 14:14.782
Yes, DAWSN.

14:14.822 --> 14:16.505
I was at the library the other night.

14:17.907 --> 14:22.074
Anyway, so there are his opinions, which obviously are taken down in shorthand and then have been written out.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.417
Well, Mr. Wanley is right there.

14:24.578 --> 14:30.647
Yes, that's right, sir.

14:30.667 --> 14:37.618
Now, what this is, is the first attempt to put

14:38.138 --> 14:46.687
to put handwriting in order chronologically, to establish a morphology of handwriting.

14:46.707 --> 14:52.873
So he has put segments, sections, his name is, did you call it a montage or a pastiche?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.135
No, it's an album, I suppose.

14:59.379 --> 15:01.321
There's examples and a fan of commentary.

15:01.341 --> 15:02.262
Are they pasted in?

15:02.723 --> 15:03.403
Yes.

15:03.423 --> 15:04.925
Did you think he did this?

15:04.945 --> 15:05.125
No.

15:06.033 --> 15:10.557
What is the writing in the background?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.379
Is that a lame description?

15:12.399 --> 15:13.460
This is Wambly.

15:13.480 --> 15:21.147
This is the account by Wambly.

15:21.168 --> 15:21.728
Okay, I got it.

15:24.431 --> 15:31.618
Now, most of his text in the early printing was done precisely for this reason.

15:31.638 --> 15:34.200
There are seven caxtons in the library.

15:34.973 --> 16:02.972
but they are there for this purpose and it is it is now the point I'm trying to make about it is that there are very it is not just in the ordinary sense of collection it is a work an exploration

16:03.323 --> 16:09.669
He never had plans to write a history of evolution scripted print.

16:09.689 --> 16:15.914
But he was moving in a circle where there were people very much involved with that.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.595
Can I just hold it there for a second?

16:17.615 --> 16:20.138
You can keep talking this one.

16:20.158 --> 16:21.279
This is a fragment.

16:21.299 --> 16:22.860
This is a fragment.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.783
I was just pointing it out to it like a textbook.

16:25.883 --> 16:30.627
But what happened is evidently that these were shown to Wandley.

16:30.647 --> 16:32.048
Wandley gave his commentary.

16:32.416 --> 17:01.630
some one he perhaps pulled the rain roses down in shorthand and then expanded it what is that word there what about the year 740 no no 960 yes it goes the whole way across mr wanley this is a fragment of isle free after canterbury

17:03.213 --> 17:04.935
and that's E-L-F-I-R-I-C.

17:08.480 --> 17:27.904
Archbishop of Canberra is Homile de Fide Catholica, D-E-F-I-D-E-C-A-T-H-O-L-I-P-A, and is supposed to have been watched about the year 960, and consequently 740 years old, and this is number 16, and of course that we will

17:28.542 --> 17:30.124
Commentary goes on both sides.

17:30.285 --> 17:31.146
It's very nicely done.

17:31.486 --> 17:34.731
I mean, it's designed beautifully, isn't it?

17:34.751 --> 17:35.212
Yes.

17:35.332 --> 17:36.634
Everything is.

17:36.654 --> 17:38.877
The albums are all material.

17:38.897 --> 17:45.527
I mean, a modern book designer would be very proud of us producing something like this.

17:45.547 --> 17:49.533
We're looking at two open pages, and there are five fragments on the left.

17:49.593 --> 17:50.073
No, no.

17:50.274 --> 17:52.056
I'll show you something from the prints.

17:52.076 --> 17:53.118
From the print page.

17:53.158 --> 17:54.540
Like this, there are two, two, and one.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.743
And then there's one, one, and one on the facing page.

17:58.107 --> 18:07.401
So this is why he tried to get this technical interest in calligraphy, is why he tried to get a book in every known script.

18:07.742 --> 18:14.392
He didn't succeed, but he got some remarkable things.

18:14.472 --> 18:17.496
That's what a white one says on the spine.

18:22.163 --> 18:23.946
You say that is the largest book in the

18:24.314 --> 18:26.597
No, it's not the large books.

18:26.637 --> 18:29.421
There are larger books, actually.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.304
But it's the largest standard size.

18:32.746 --> 18:33.747
How many volumes are there?

18:34.648 --> 18:36.811
A colligual collection of three volumes.

18:37.252 --> 18:40.056
What is that symbol there, would you say, in the middle?

18:40.076 --> 18:44.942
Introduction, general.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.067
General masters English.

18:48.968 --> 18:51.992
And masters English, because it includes English writing masters.

18:52.428 --> 18:54.691
General and Marsters.

18:58.696 --> 18:58.976
Okay.

18:58.996 --> 19:02.000
Another few of these.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.905
They are... Extraordinary.

19:06.005 --> 19:08.949
I don't know what he said.

19:09.009 --> 19:11.873
There's the second edition of the Caxson Catholic Tales.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.655
The Incunerals, of course.

19:14.876 --> 19:18.161
But the Incunerals were arranged to see their particular purposes.

19:18.581 --> 19:21.625
One of the major collections of Incunerals is of Grammos.

19:21.841 --> 19:29.690
So in other words, he could have bought, and the incurable brothels were in common, I mean, they were being torn up to waste paper.

19:30.651 --> 19:35.176
So he collected from certain areas, I mean, grammar, grammar.

19:35.836 --> 19:41.863
And you see, one of the things that he was much involved in was the foundation of the writing school at the Charterhouse.

19:41.883 --> 19:43.625
Well, for instance, here is a Latin grammar.

19:43.685 --> 19:43.905
Yes.

19:44.065 --> 19:50.953
By John Sulp, S-U-L-P-I-T-I-U-S, printed by Pinson, London, 1498-P-O-1305.

19:51.237 --> 19:53.620
And again, it's a functional... That's it.

19:53.780 --> 19:56.984
That whole volume consists of grammars.

19:57.004 --> 19:58.746
Arrains chronologically again.

20:01.630 --> 20:04.012
The Dame of Chess.

20:04.553 --> 20:12.022
Printed by Cax in Westminster, 1478.

20:12.743 --> 20:14.085
I'm dazzled.

20:14.105 --> 20:18.510
Well, I'll just go on and on.

20:18.845 --> 20:22.109
And I can't... We can wrap this up pretty soon, too.

20:22.149 --> 20:22.309
Sorry?

20:22.330 --> 20:23.972
We can wrap this up pretty soon.

20:23.992 --> 20:30.380
I can't go on in desperate time, because I... Now, the print... Actually, this is, you know, any time you want to conclude this one.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.461
The print collection.

20:32.603 --> 20:32.803
Okay.

20:35.286 --> 20:38.531
The print collection.

20:38.551 --> 20:39.432
Seven volumes.

20:39.712 --> 20:40.493
Same pattern.

20:40.513 --> 20:45.520
Again, elephant folios, prints, generals, general, volume one, New Testament.

20:46.221 --> 20:48.143
Well, yes, this is...

20:49.490 --> 20:51.713
Look at the binding.

20:52.094 --> 20:53.696
This is very exquisitely done.

20:54.237 --> 20:56.701
Oh, yes.

20:56.941 --> 21:05.695
This must be about the most considered library, insofar as one library could ever come from one man's.

21:05.715 --> 21:17.893
Now, again, you see the... So this is New Testament, and on the chronological...

21:18.312 --> 21:47.475
cosmographical plan it goes it goes um in fact there are three volumes of biblical programs and they go from genesis through to revelation and the new testament goes from the annunciation uh through um nativity and many of them are well we'll see the name of pullouts um

21:48.755 --> 21:53.761
You see, they're all meticulously... That's a pull-out.

21:53.781 --> 21:55.363
It's not one of the most spectacular pull-outs.

21:56.225 --> 21:59.609
Do you see him enjoying his library every day in the evening?

22:00.089 --> 22:00.951
Oh, all the time.

22:01.231 --> 22:02.713
Well, just the evening.

22:02.733 --> 22:12.485
You see, after 1690, really, when he was out of the tower, his time must have been on his hands, really.

22:13.326 --> 22:16.671
And he was still doing charitable work.

22:16.691 --> 22:17.732
But conversational.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.872
Here's a juror.

22:28.841 --> 22:37.550
And in this collection, the things contained in it are quite extraordinary.

22:37.710 --> 22:48.462
It has to be a little bit cautious actually about it.

22:49.083 --> 22:56.653
And that's a Rembrandt.

22:57.794 --> 22:58.655
That is a Rembrandt.

22:58.976 --> 22:59.616
Yes.

22:59.636 --> 23:02.440
The descent from the cross, second plate, Rembrandt.

23:06.665 --> 23:09.469
That is on page 235, New Testament.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.172
And it's a double truck, as you say.

23:12.312 --> 23:14.415
Yes, but there's also the...

23:18.108 --> 23:25.518
Rembrandt's Three Crosses, which is printed on vellum, which is why it has that.

23:25.778 --> 23:29.884
A couple of that was sold and done to least half a million pounds.

23:30.024 --> 23:32.748
Ours is really rather better.

23:32.768 --> 23:39.056
And there's also... There's three crosses.

23:39.076 --> 23:42.501
Christ shown to these people.

23:42.561 --> 23:45.185
Half a million pounds.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.366
Actually, I got it wrong.

23:46.386 --> 23:46.967
That was a quarter.

23:47.369 --> 23:51.975
Which was the one that went to the Happy New Year?

23:51.995 --> 24:07.055
Question to the people.

24:07.135 --> 24:08.056
That's fine, sir.

24:08.076 --> 24:09.198
No, it's all right.

24:09.318 --> 24:14.625
It just came quick to me because I had eventually to

24:14.993 --> 24:17.676
There used to be an open over-placement.

24:27.428 --> 24:28.950
This could almost be a museum.

24:29.791 --> 24:32.634
I'm thankful that it isn't.

24:32.654 --> 24:33.556
It's odd, isn't it?

24:34.777 --> 24:39.102
I sometimes get people who are very aggressive about it.

24:39.122 --> 24:43.027
And they say, why won't you do that?

24:43.047 --> 24:43.768
Oh, God bless it.

24:44.542 --> 24:47.505
Christ, presenter to the people, Rembrandt.

24:47.565 --> 24:49.247
What is this pencil?

24:49.648 --> 24:51.610
Oh, that's wretchily odd.

24:51.690 --> 24:57.817
I'm afraid that one of my predecessors, well, not one of my fellow predecessors, but in the system.

24:58.197 --> 25:07.147
You see, because this library, for a long time, it was more or less secret, and it wasn't until 1956 that it became, it was reformed again.

25:07.347 --> 25:11.532
It was moved into another part of the same building.

25:11.552 --> 25:11.612
And

25:13.128 --> 25:16.912
It was original here until about 1840.

25:17.152 --> 25:21.356
Yes, and laid out roughly as it did now.

25:22.197 --> 25:28.463
But, you see, people get very head-out about it, because why can't they come to these books?

25:29.504 --> 25:33.428
Well, the answer is, first of all, is to be aware and care of this.

25:33.528 --> 25:35.871
I always make the conditions.

25:35.891 --> 25:38.393
If the book could be decided somewhere else, they must be.

25:39.183 --> 25:55.082
But we do try to give people all the help we can, both by looking up their single references, or by, if they are accredited scholars who have to use something, then of course they're as helpful as we can be.

25:55.403 --> 25:58.427
And we do have very good photography facilities, not bizarrely.

25:59.127 --> 26:05.715
Behind that door there, there is the camera room, which indeed is almost entirely one camera.

26:07.418 --> 26:08.599
And so we are...

26:08.883 --> 26:12.828
as hopeful as we can be with the talk of the addresses.

26:12.848 --> 26:20.136
But the other thing is, these things in print collection, we have no way of displaying them, really.

26:20.336 --> 26:26.103
We keep one.

26:26.363 --> 26:32.611
Normally, when the arrival is over to the public, all of the cases have their comes up obviously.

26:34.513 --> 26:38.097
And we really will have one volume of print collection.

26:38.870 --> 26:49.880
we could not actually display more without wrecking the sense of intimacy in the room and the feeling that it still somehow keeps his private library.

26:55.486 --> 26:59.950
I think this is, I really don't mean to impose any further in your time.

26:59.970 --> 27:03.073
I mean, this is quite, quite much more than I ever expected.

27:03.093 --> 27:03.974
Well, it's extraordinary.

27:03.994 --> 27:08.758
I mean, it is almost so much that it's, I mean, this thing about the greatest

27:08.941 --> 27:12.484
into the sphere of space, you know, it is.

27:12.504 --> 27:13.285
Yes, yes.

27:13.305 --> 27:16.668
Tell me, say something, I have to write it down.

27:16.768 --> 27:21.553
It's wonderful.

27:22.153 --> 27:26.898
Let's just take a brief look under this, and then we can probably stop.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.862
But you see, the print section, it is so sad in a way.

27:33.344 --> 27:36.687
Yes, the prints are better preserved.

27:37.257 --> 27:39.059
It's like the great watercolors.

27:40.781 --> 27:48.290
They only take them out every few years and display them for a few weeks.

27:48.831 --> 27:57.922
It's really best to look at them as reproduction, because otherwise watercolors do not last if they're close to sun and elements.

27:58.262 --> 28:01.206
This is the Anthony Anthony Road.

28:02.030 --> 28:03.132
Oh, boy.

28:03.152 --> 28:06.199
Picture of the Mary Rose, the ship would say.

28:06.339 --> 28:17.423
This is the Anthony Roll, Anthony, R-O-L-L, drawn up by Anthony, Anthony of the Royal Ordinance and presented by him to Henry VIII in 1546.

28:18.264 --> 28:22.333
Two-thirds of the roll were given to Pepys by Charles II in 1680.

28:22.634 --> 28:28.483
It contains the only known contemporary depiction of the Mary Rose, English 1546, PL 2991.

28:28.823 --> 28:30.726
This is larger than the American Folio.

28:30.746 --> 28:32.508
This is quite enormous, I have to say.

28:33.650 --> 28:35.373
Well, it's almost square, isn't it?

28:35.393 --> 28:37.316
It's two and a half feet by two and a half feet.

28:37.336 --> 28:40.200
You see, it was a roll, and Pepys had it bound up.

28:40.620 --> 28:41.842
Oh, I see.

28:43.324 --> 28:47.190
Well, in fact, I will show you what people don't normally imagine.

28:48.200 --> 29:16.384
one of the very very rare examples of um putting a binding on

29:16.988 --> 29:18.850
Now could you put a hand on it?

29:19.230 --> 29:22.574
It would be my privilege.

29:24.716 --> 29:26.959
So he had it changed.

29:27.139 --> 29:33.226
The remaining third of the role is in the museum, I regret to say, because Charles couldn't find it.

29:33.846 --> 29:34.907
When they did find it?

29:34.927 --> 29:35.788
To give it to Pepys.

29:35.808 --> 29:40.954
But Pepys had this, turned this from a role into a bound-up book.

29:42.757 --> 29:44.359
That's what's known as marbling, I guess.

29:44.379 --> 29:45.781
He loved marble paper.

29:45.801 --> 29:46.442
That was one thing.

29:46.462 --> 29:48.524
Of course, marble paper is very cheap.

29:49.165 --> 29:50.747
But it's one thing he really went to town on.

29:52.108 --> 29:52.669
Oh, my God.

29:52.689 --> 29:54.291
Look at that.

29:54.712 --> 29:55.893
How would you describe that?

29:56.474 --> 29:59.918
Well, it's another binding by the royal binder, Mian.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.903
And as you see, it's bigger than elephant folio.

30:05.665 --> 30:06.586
It's three clasps.

30:06.927 --> 30:10.571
It's got three clasps with Pete's arms and his crest.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.173
His arms, his crest.

30:12.507 --> 30:15.911
and his insignia as Secretary of the Admiralty.

30:16.792 --> 30:20.356
You can see that this is a book that he particularly valued.

30:20.396 --> 30:24.861
Magnificently tooled, the finest leather, gold, embossed.

30:26.383 --> 30:29.406
The point of the book is actually the list of ordnance.

30:30.027 --> 30:34.772
Guns of brass, guns of iron, gunpowder, shot of iron.

30:34.872 --> 30:38.937
In other words, it's a practical thing.

30:39.305 --> 30:50.156
And actually there is something that I do not normally tell people, and that is that the Mary Rose is a piece of wishful thinking, because she went, she was sunk.

30:50.236 --> 30:51.697
A maiden voyage, wasn't it?

30:51.798 --> 30:53.279
Well, virtually.

30:53.880 --> 31:00.246
In 1545, this role was engrossed, was made up in 46.

31:01.668 --> 31:04.090
But this is because they still hoped to raise her.

31:05.091 --> 31:05.712
They really did.

31:05.752 --> 31:09.075
There were Italian drivers.

31:09.545 --> 31:10.626
working on her.

31:10.647 --> 31:14.592
And they got ropes around her, tables around her.

31:14.652 --> 31:16.535
So that must be why they put her in the row.

31:19.519 --> 31:20.921
You can see why it was necessary?

31:21.181 --> 31:29.252
Why Pepys being the Navy man, this was so appropriate for him.

31:31.275 --> 31:32.497
The Mary Rose.

31:33.378 --> 31:34.599
What does it say, the Mary Rose?

31:34.619 --> 31:36.983
What does it give a tonnage?

31:37.003 --> 31:37.584
The Mary Rose.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.366
What does it say on the right there?

31:40.274 --> 31:43.917
Oh, um... Tonnage, I guess.

31:44.037 --> 31:45.879
Oh, no, it's of the line, ship of the line.

31:45.999 --> 31:48.121
It's just something of the line.

31:48.401 --> 31:48.501
Yes.

31:50.143 --> 31:51.484
That's an old line officer.

31:51.624 --> 31:52.825
I can recognize that.

31:52.885 --> 31:54.207
This is great, sir.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.349
I think that I've... Well, one last thing.

31:57.429 --> 31:58.170
Okay.

31:58.210 --> 32:01.133
This is, I mean, this is Pepys really fluctuating, correct?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.795
Well, I mean, he was going to write this thing.

32:04.116 --> 32:06.017
That is the cardio book, the Spanish Armada.

32:08.339 --> 32:09.100
It's a listing.

32:09.721 --> 32:11.483
on vitals.

32:12.424 --> 32:13.325
Oh my God.

32:13.345 --> 32:15.108
On every one of the Gariums.

32:15.128 --> 32:19.112
Libro de Cabo, L-I-D-R-O, small D-E-C-A-I-G-O-S.

32:19.733 --> 32:26.682
An inventory of stores carried by the Spanish Armada drawn up for the chief victualer, 1587, PL 226.

32:27.022 --> 32:31.888
And 1587, because remember, it was going to sell in 1587, it didn't sell in 1588.

32:32.008 --> 32:35.132
And if it had, it would be at the bottom of the channel someplace.

32:35.172 --> 32:39.357
He must have bought this in Spain, because obviously it would never have gone with the Armada.

32:39.623 --> 32:47.691
And in 1683, he managed to make a journey overland through Spain after winding up the British colony in Tangier.

32:47.971 --> 32:50.314
And that's a tidal almanac, which is impressive.

32:51.255 --> 32:53.977
Well, it belonged to France Drake, which is not even more impressive.

32:54.077 --> 32:57.120
It makes it quite impressive, doesn't it?

32:57.140 --> 33:03.867
And then sort of chart of the coasts of Northwest Europe and with the signature of France's Drake, Le Conquet.

33:04.047 --> 33:06.349
Le Conquet, in Britain, yeah.

33:06.490 --> 33:08.972
C-O-N-C-U-E-T, Brittany, 1546.1.

33:09.897 --> 33:10.739
There's PO1.

33:10.799 --> 33:12.162
It's book number one in the library.

33:12.803 --> 33:14.287
Is that his book number one in the library?

33:14.307 --> 33:15.389
Yes, yes.

33:15.409 --> 33:17.413
I think it must have been a joke of Peeps' in the way.

33:18.015 --> 33:20.239
Though the numbering does start with the smallest box.

33:20.781 --> 33:21.843
Why would that be a joke?

33:22.625 --> 33:26.914
Well, you know, I mean, Francis Drake's tried to nominate people.

33:26.934 --> 33:29.239
And that is the Duke of York's Naval Pocketbook.

33:29.523 --> 33:35.452
A list of ships and captains run up by Pepys and used by James II as Lord High Admiral 1667.

33:35.772 --> 33:37.515
Quick reference.

33:37.535 --> 33:42.442
It's fascinating because at the back there are some pencil notes, and if you put it under Rating Light, you can read them.

33:42.462 --> 33:45.827
And they are records of wagers between the Duke of York and Mr. Pepys.

33:48.731 --> 33:50.113
Anyway, well... I feel it.

33:50.273 --> 33:56.442
I do feel... I'll conclude the tape at this point, if that's okay.

33:58.278 --> 33:59.720
This has been a rare experience, sir.

34:00.361 --> 34:16.842
Well, obviously, as you see, it's something which, in a way, can only be appreciated through explanation, and it is not like other libraries, that's certainly the case.

34:17.122 --> 34:21.568
I have been seeing nothing but wonderful libraries for the past year, and I have to say it's...

34:21.920 --> 34:24.943
I'm going to use the word unique.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.966
I know you don't like it.

34:27.046 --> 34:30.650
No, I think you can use it about this, because it's sufficiently complex.

34:30.990 --> 34:36.797
But you does have to fight to persuade people that it is a beautiful, practical library.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.600
Now, Pepe was actually a religious.

34:39.620 --> 34:40.801
He did throw things out.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.524
In the diary period, he throws a couple of books.

34:43.544 --> 34:44.405
He gets rid of books.

34:44.425 --> 34:46.768
Actually, that's because they're mildly pornographically.

34:46.788 --> 34:48.310
He doesn't like having them.

34:48.330 --> 34:50.492
But later on, he changed

34:51.468 --> 34:55.712
If he bought a new edition of the book, then he would get rid of the old one.

34:55.932 --> 34:57.854
The first editions were irrelevant in those days.

34:57.934 --> 34:59.416
Absolutely.

34:59.436 --> 35:00.817
The best editions.

35:00.877 --> 35:02.919
This was the one area in which he made mistakes.

35:03.319 --> 35:08.585
He obviously had a quite incredible feel for the importance of this.

35:08.625 --> 35:14.670
I tried to indicate that his feeling was always related to one of his strands of radical thought.

35:14.691 --> 35:17.273
But he sold his second

35:17.877 --> 35:42.130
second folio shakespeare bought the four that's like thereby acquiring 22 000 mistress oh is is the is the fourth here yes i don't wish to see it but i'm just um
