WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:03.884
We're speaking with Dr. John.

00:05.105 --> 00:07.247
Simmons, is that how you pronounce your name, sir?

00:07.848 --> 00:08.468
That's how I do.

00:08.488 --> 00:09.409
Two M's.

00:09.429 --> 00:10.971
S-I-M-M-O-N-S.

00:10.991 --> 00:11.972
Do you use a middle initial?

00:12.953 --> 00:14.014
Well, sometimes.

00:14.234 --> 00:15.235
I use two.

00:15.255 --> 00:16.216
You do, actually.

00:16.596 --> 00:16.997
Which are?

00:17.758 --> 00:18.739
J-S-G.

00:18.759 --> 00:19.840
J-S-G.

00:19.860 --> 00:20.100
Yeah.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.262
And you've been here how long?

00:22.462 --> 00:25.205
Well, actually, in Oxford, for just 50 years.

00:26.667 --> 00:27.608
How many, sir?

00:27.628 --> 00:27.748
50.

00:27.768 --> 00:28.088
50?

00:28.268 --> 00:29.029
Just 50?

00:29.209 --> 00:29.429
Yeah.

00:30.651 --> 00:32.012
Well, that's just...

00:32.380 --> 00:34.022
artistic exaggeration.

00:34.463 --> 00:37.147
I came on the 1st of January, 1949.

00:37.388 --> 00:40.833
That's 48 years ago.

00:41.213 --> 00:43.216
And you've been involved in libraries?

00:43.236 --> 00:54.874
Yes, well, I was a librarian before the war, and I started in 1932 in Birmingham University as a library boy.

00:55.615 --> 01:00.042
They had a very good system that you worked 25 hours in the library.

01:00.663 --> 01:04.929
It was a free college education at the university.

01:05.269 --> 01:15.322
So I started that when I was 17, and I did have a bachelor's degree, I suppose, in 1937.

01:15.523 --> 01:28.560
I took the degree and then started research on the history of printing in Russia, and that was interrupted by the war, and I was away from 1939 until 1945.

01:29.131 --> 01:37.101
And they went back off to the war to the University of Ibrahim Birmingham as a sub-librarian, and was there for two years.

01:37.922 --> 01:51.099
And then I was invited to come to Oxford because they were expanding their Russian and European studies, and they wanted a specialist librarian.

01:51.279 --> 01:58.328
I'd already specialized, of course, in Russian at that time, to fill the collection.

01:59.050 --> 02:27.218
retrospectively because very little had been done before and they saw it as an opportunity if they got someone who had a pretty free sort of job description who could initiate strengthening of the collections in Slavonic.

02:27.974 --> 02:41.336
in the two main university libraries, the Bodleian, which is the general library, and the Taylorian, which is the specialist library for language and literature of Europe.

02:42.418 --> 02:45.984
And they gave me a pretty free hand.

02:47.326 --> 02:50.792
And so I traveled to Eastern Europe.

02:51.110 --> 02:59.721
and also to Finland, where Helsinki, of course, has a collection.

02:59.821 --> 03:03.886
And I arranged exchanges and bought material.

03:03.906 --> 03:15.520
And then from 1953, after the day of Stalin, when it became possible to get to Russia, I went there in May.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.082
He died in March.

03:17.943 --> 03:20.526
And started an exchange

03:21.097 --> 03:29.805
relation with the Lenin Library, what was then the Lenin Library.

03:30.906 --> 03:38.953
And it was quite amusing because I was the first Western Libranian that they'd seen spectacularly.

03:39.153 --> 03:49.703
And I came prepared with long lists of our desiderata, and also carrying the catalog of the Oxford University Press.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.325
And I said, what do you want me?

03:56.209 --> 03:57.732
And I'll show you what I want.

03:58.553 --> 03:59.675
It'll work out.

03:59.876 --> 04:03.884
And I mean, they trusted me, and I trusted them.

04:04.785 --> 04:08.132
And it was just all a bit of a relationship.

04:08.353 --> 04:11.419
So it was more of a symbiotic kind of a… Yes.

04:11.799 --> 04:13.142
They want it.

04:13.325 --> 04:24.223
current scientific material, of course, and we wanted to pull gaps in the 19th and early 20th century history languages.

04:24.243 --> 04:34.640
So, of course, I extended the exchange to many other libraries, big libraries, and so on.

04:35.401 --> 04:38.927
And then I extended it to

04:39.363 --> 04:54.568
Well, that's very interesting, because you had a chance to see the whole library culture during the Soviet period in a certain way.

04:55.930 --> 04:59.035
A very strong understanding of what it's like.

04:59.256 --> 05:03.042
So, was there a sense of

05:04.220 --> 05:13.354
in terms of book culture during the Soviet period, as Edward has suggested to me, that the real purpose, it seems, was political more than intellectual.

05:13.635 --> 05:15.979
Do you agree with that or disagree with that?

05:16.620 --> 05:27.136
Well, on the surface, it can to be political because it was more than their jobs were to take any other than the party's mind.

05:27.837 --> 05:31.543
But there was always a sort of subculture

05:32.266 --> 05:48.441
mainly of people of earlier generations to whom the traditions of Russian librarianship and the Russian book and so on were extremely dear.

05:48.801 --> 06:01.733
And that remained in the rare book departments which were all the big libraries, usually found old ladies or old men who

06:01.898 --> 06:16.695
under the surface remain the experts, whereas the officials, usually younger people, who were party members first.

06:16.715 --> 06:25.985
But once you've penetrated that layer, you got to know who really mattered and who really knew.

06:26.005 --> 06:30.150
And I've retained this correspondence under many of the messages

06:30.350 --> 06:34.194
now in their 80s, some in their 90s.

06:34.214 --> 06:36.637
Did they remain people of the book?

06:36.737 --> 06:38.759
Oh, yes, very much.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.322
There's a very strong tradition.

06:41.422 --> 06:45.006
I mean, I speak mainly about Russia because I know that best.

06:46.388 --> 06:58.922
But again, in Yugoslavia, in Serbia, scholars, very often people interested in Anglo-Serve relations.

06:59.138 --> 07:02.883
whom I could help with material.

07:04.565 --> 07:05.807
Czechoslovakia.

07:06.228 --> 07:13.678
Of course, as you come more Western, it becomes more Western, if you see what I mean.

07:14.559 --> 07:22.750
But the Russian book culture, and I think the Slavic book culture in general,

07:25.042 --> 07:31.351
never died, because it's essentially something that is built on precedent.

07:31.511 --> 07:39.101
I mean, the book is essentially a monument that remains from generation to generation.

07:39.121 --> 07:49.255
I mean, that's the essence of the life, of course, is the place where the wisdom of the past is maintained.

07:49.275 --> 07:53.260
And one other factor which is remarkable in...

07:53.594 --> 08:11.203
in Russia, I noticed, is the extraordinary interest in the personal library at that period, which was pretty grim in the fifties.

08:11.944 --> 08:17.914
The personal library was the great place for the expression of personality.

08:18.873 --> 08:26.661
I'm amazed that the personal libraries were allowed to flourish during that period.

08:27.361 --> 08:42.456
Well, I've seen, I mean, enormous libraries, and Berkhof, for example, who Naomi may know, P. N. Berkhof, who wrote a history of Soviet bibliography, he had a library of over $30,000.

08:42.596 --> 08:47.901
I mean, his flack, he had a

08:48.472 --> 08:52.896
It was absolutely with books.

08:53.436 --> 08:56.039
And another man, B.S.

08:56.719 --> 09:08.789
Podnowski, he too went to see him, and his desk was piled high with books on the floor.

09:10.031 --> 09:17.517
He had been the editor of Knies and I guess in the very early years after the revolution.

09:17.767 --> 09:22.592
and he maintained high standards in book culture.

09:22.612 --> 09:25.134
And these were his books, his personal books?

09:25.175 --> 09:26.216
His books, yes.

09:26.376 --> 09:33.563
I mean, I saw on the shelves books that technically didn't exist.

09:34.864 --> 09:35.985
Could you explain that?

09:36.006 --> 09:38.588
What do you mean technically didn't exist?

09:38.648 --> 09:40.690
Well, they were prescribed.

09:40.790 --> 09:46.356
Copies had been ordered to be destroyed or put into special

09:46.488 --> 09:51.677
collections which were not available for public.

09:51.837 --> 09:55.443
They called them, how is your Russian money?

09:56.104 --> 09:58.248
That's a disadvantage, I may say.

09:59.089 --> 10:00.993
But they called them living corpses.

10:01.113 --> 10:02.736
Oh, that's great.

10:02.756 --> 10:05.580
How would you just say that in Russian?

10:06.782 --> 10:11.871
Living corpses.

10:15.985 --> 10:17.566
I love that.

10:17.586 --> 10:25.394
But there's no doubt that, you see, the book was an expression of culture, of personality.

10:25.414 --> 10:30.098
It was a thing you could buy throughout the Soviet period.

10:30.639 --> 10:40.788
One couldn't buy everything, but, I mean, if you wanted Tolstoy, if you wanted Pushkin, if you wanted Germantr, they were all there, and they were all validity.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.090
And...

10:43.778 --> 10:45.521
It was one of the main things.

10:45.641 --> 10:47.284
I mean, it was like music again.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.871
It was a conflict in Russia.

10:50.891 --> 10:53.015
It was an emotional presence.

10:54.097 --> 11:01.691
It was an expression of personality that existed only under the greatest of pressure.

11:02.953 --> 11:06.259
Were these so-called living corpses?

11:06.560 --> 11:13.166
Were they available only on the black market, so to speak, or through clandestine sources?

11:13.186 --> 11:17.090
Well, in general, they were hand to hand.

11:17.110 --> 11:31.083
I mean, there was people who had been concerned with libraries or with publishing or with national bibliography, that kind of thing.

11:31.704 --> 11:36.448
They would have tended to acquire these books.

11:38.808 --> 12:02.757
And there was, I think, certainly in the 20s, there was extremely lively societies of book novelists, I mean, in Leningrad, particularly strong, very large collections of ex-libris, for you to know.

12:03.462 --> 12:12.093
They produced almanacs in an edition of 300 copies, you know, numbered copies.

12:12.213 --> 12:13.995
Somehow they managed to do it.

12:14.015 --> 12:29.775
Of course, after the new economic policy of 1921 and until the clampdown in, I suppose, the early 30s, private publishing was possible.

12:29.795 --> 12:33.199
And there were a very large number of limited editions.

12:33.432 --> 12:35.555
produced during that time.

12:35.575 --> 12:40.902
And the book art, the illustration, they had brilliant engravers.

12:43.526 --> 12:53.340
But it was done under the external pressure that was genuinely accepted to me.

12:53.360 --> 12:57.546
That is fascinating, isn't it?

12:57.666 --> 13:00.570
Another thing that Edward had suggested to me

13:01.040 --> 13:14.259
I'm so interested in the library as a vehicle of retaining and passing on memory from your history and your culture.

13:14.279 --> 13:28.178
And of course, as it has been suggested during the Soviet period, there was an attempt to more or less consolidate all these different national cultures throughout the Soviet period.

13:29.457 --> 13:46.557
And he said there was the creation of these emigre libraries outside of the Soviet Union, where materials were either surreptitiously brought out of the Soviet Union.

13:46.717 --> 13:55.127
You had these libraries set up in New York or wherever.

13:55.411 --> 14:08.685
The best known, I suppose, was the Bibliothèque Turgenev in Paris, which I think the journals actually stole during the war.

14:08.705 --> 14:17.194
And it was only... There is literature about it, but I don't know anything in English or in French.

14:17.214 --> 14:20.817
There are certainly articles in Russian about it.

14:20.898 --> 14:22.259
Bibliothèque Turgenev.

14:22.279 --> 14:22.719
Yes.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.182
It has a very fine collection.

14:25.398 --> 14:30.008
was established, I suppose, in the 1880s.

14:30.028 --> 14:39.649
And you'll find, of course, when you get Russian language, you'll get Russian language, because Russians are book-oriented.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.495
So then books have always been

14:42.830 --> 14:50.761
more than just politics during the czarist regime.

14:51.542 --> 15:11.048
The problem of how to get things published, books weren't neutral, and the Russians have a very keen sense towards a culture which is essentially transmitted, has been transmitted until a few years ago, in the form of the printed book.

15:11.483 --> 15:13.405
That's fascinating.

15:13.425 --> 15:18.650
And the Bibliothèque Turgenev, it existed in Russia?

15:18.670 --> 15:19.731
Before that, no.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.834
And then it was more or less... No, no, no, it was established in France.

15:22.854 --> 15:23.955
So it was established.

15:24.155 --> 15:30.241
Because there was a large emigrant population in France before 1917.

15:30.261 --> 15:30.481
I see.

15:30.581 --> 15:34.365
It meant the left-wing emigrants.

15:34.385 --> 15:36.647
And so they brought with them the books?

15:36.667 --> 15:41.271
Yes, or they bought books, or they got books, or they smuggled books.

15:41.723 --> 15:51.552
The revolutionaries were smuggling books into Russia, and the emigres were getting books out to Russia.

15:51.572 --> 15:53.634
And how long did this exist?

15:55.636 --> 16:04.384
Well, it existed up to the war, but as I say, I think you'll find that the Germans actually stowed, I agree.

16:04.404 --> 16:06.546
But it was... During World War II.

16:06.646 --> 16:10.870
During World War II, but it was returned, and I think it still functioned again.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.163
If you're in Paris, you can go and see it.

16:14.183 --> 16:15.966
That's fascinating.

16:15.986 --> 16:31.190
Whether there was a similar library in New York, I don't know, but there was certainly the Ukrainians in New York who believe the active cultural center of the Ukrainian academy.

16:31.210 --> 16:34.075
Apparently there are two Ukrainian libraries in New York.

16:34.255 --> 16:35.578
Yes, you know.

16:35.598 --> 16:35.838
Yes.

16:36.199 --> 16:37.621
As you mentioned, you said they're very good.

16:38.062 --> 16:38.342
Yes.

16:38.761 --> 16:43.246
There was an Aquanian Library up in Connecticut.

16:43.266 --> 16:52.217
It is interesting that these people did bring with them, not only their memory, but they brought their books, the documents.

16:52.237 --> 16:58.625
And, of course, they were extraordinarily keen on their culture.

16:58.645 --> 17:05.173
I mean, the way to make people think about that culture is to present them.

17:05.525 --> 17:23.190
I don't know precisely how I'm going to begin this chapter, but I think one way to get into it is this horrible situation that happened in Sarajevo just four and a half years ago, how in one night this library is targeted and destroyed with 1.2 million books.

17:23.931 --> 17:29.499
The apparent purpose is if you're going to destroy a people and eradicate their culture, you have to destroy their books.

17:29.639 --> 17:32.123
Well, the same thing with the Germans.

17:32.592 --> 17:44.430
in November 1944 in Poland when they collected this many Polish manuscripts and early printed books and set fire to them.

17:44.450 --> 17:46.313
I didn't know that.

17:46.333 --> 17:46.834
In Poland?

17:47.114 --> 17:47.735
Yes.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.538
Ask any Pole about it.

17:49.558 --> 17:53.284
I mean, the Great Stocks.

17:53.737 --> 17:59.182
culture was done absolutely.

17:59.202 --> 18:09.572
They were centralized in, I'm not sure whether it was a national library, but there's plenty of literature on this, and set farther.

18:09.592 --> 18:20.283
I mean, there's no doubt that you see the printed word up to now has been the great repository of national culture.

18:20.303 --> 18:20.723
I think it's

18:21.108 --> 18:28.337
it is preserved and conveyed by means of a piece of book.

18:29.318 --> 18:40.973
If you want to destroy, well particularly the poles, you'll always be under pressure from both boundaries and this made them

18:41.813 --> 19:08.175
more sensitive about the value of their culture, intensely nationalistic, and really in Western Europe, the idea that a writer can be a political figure, a very political figure, that conception only exists, whereas in Poland it would be a writer without being a writer.

19:08.510 --> 19:14.056
You were constantly reminded that you were under pressure.

19:15.117 --> 19:17.860
Why did they specifically target the pole, do you think?

19:18.380 --> 19:24.046
Well, I think there's a natural antipathy between the Germans and Poles.

19:24.066 --> 19:30.773
You see, there was all the struggle about East Germany and Poles.

19:30.913 --> 19:33.876
I mean, you'll find all these towns have got...

19:34.042 --> 19:37.727
a Polish form and a German form.

19:37.747 --> 19:45.419
Well, that is immediately significant, that there are cultural tensions.

19:45.999 --> 19:54.372
The worst example is Lvov in Malaysia, where it has six names.

19:55.774 --> 19:57.376
Now, what does this mean?

19:57.396 --> 20:01.602
Lvov, it's the English form, it's the only thing you'll read.

20:04.450 --> 20:07.694
You've got Le Vif, which is the Polish form.

20:07.794 --> 20:14.623
You've got Le Wolf, which is the Polish form.

20:14.643 --> 20:18.128
You've got Lemberg, which is the German form.

20:18.148 --> 20:29.222
And the British Museum used to solve the problem by calling it Leopolis.

20:29.463 --> 20:32.787
But it's highly significant if you've got different forms of names.

20:32.969 --> 20:37.234
Pozen, Poznan, for example.

20:37.294 --> 20:42.480
Stettin, Szczecin, Danzig.

20:43.501 --> 20:45.704
This immediately is extremely significant.

20:45.724 --> 20:48.427
There's a cultural clash there.

20:48.447 --> 21:00.141
Now, paradoxically, when you think that the Nazis were destroying Jews, and yet there were indications they were going to create a museum.

21:01.117 --> 21:13.472
I wonder why... I don't know how serious that was, whether it was just simply a way of justifying the collection of valuable objects.

21:15.038 --> 21:22.087
It would almost be like a museum of an extinct species, so to speak, and it would have been a curiosity.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.831
But again, you see, it is cultural murder.

21:25.231 --> 21:25.652
It is.

21:25.672 --> 21:32.661
Of course, in this case, they're killing the people and retaining evidence of their existence, but as a curiosity.

21:35.405 --> 21:43.876
Do you have any doubt if, God forbid, had the Nazis been successful against Great Britain during the war, that they would have tried a similar thing?

21:43.936 --> 21:44.657
Do you think English...

21:45.008 --> 21:47.491
Oh, no, they would have been.

21:47.511 --> 22:05.929
I mean, I've seen the battle orders for the invasion, and all bales between 16 and 65 were to be exported to Germany.

22:06.530 --> 22:13.497
Under quite a possible task, because I mean, there are billions and millions of them, but that was the idea.

22:13.898 --> 22:27.120
So, I mean, there really would have been an eradication of culture.

22:27.541 --> 22:27.781
Yes.

22:28.462 --> 22:28.983
Yeah.

22:29.003 --> 22:31.567
Do you have any thoughts as we approach?

22:32.449 --> 22:37.257
We were very pleased to see in the library, I was very pleased to see that you do have card catalogs.

22:37.277 --> 22:40.362
I haven't seen that the computers are taking over in there.

22:40.797 --> 22:47.267
Are book acquisitions still an important element, an important aspect?

22:47.287 --> 22:51.394
But of course, this library is rather specialized.

22:51.894 --> 22:58.084
It's a college library, but it's open to all members of the university.

22:58.104 --> 23:04.274
And all the other college libraries are primarily for their own students.

23:05.536 --> 23:07.058
But as we've got no students,

23:07.679 --> 23:16.969
Our library has been open to the university since the 1860s, and it's a specialist library in history and law.

23:19.091 --> 23:27.059
We contain the card catalogue, but all our acquisitions go on to the computer.

23:28.280 --> 23:34.767
There's a central computer network for all Oxford libraries below this.

23:35.607 --> 23:47.879
And the general principle is that administration is decentralized, information is essential, so that people know what we want.

23:48.479 --> 24:00.431
And of course, it is open to undergraduates and graduates concerned with history and law, but it's unique in that sense.

24:00.451 --> 24:04.635
The libraries of other colleges are not specialized.

24:05.425 --> 24:08.068
because they have students in all faculties.

24:08.088 --> 24:11.491
We have no students at all.

24:11.511 --> 24:14.254
I didn't know you had two students.

24:14.274 --> 24:18.759
It's entirely a research establishment.

24:18.779 --> 24:19.260
I see.

24:19.280 --> 24:31.973
We've got 70 fellows, or perhaps 20 professors attached to the column, and then we've got senior research fellows and juniors.

24:32.662 --> 24:43.275
There is a certain concentration on history and law, but many other fields are covered, particularly by the professors who chairs .

24:44.216 --> 24:56.290
Do you have any attitude on this move towards computerization and the digitization of books?

24:56.624 --> 25:03.693
Do you have any strong opinions on, in the United States, we have colleges that are deaccessioning books.

25:03.713 --> 25:04.054
Yeah.

25:04.074 --> 25:07.198
And I'm taking a look at that in this .

25:07.218 --> 25:09.961
There are two important articles in New York.

25:10.182 --> 25:11.423
I expect you've seen those.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.686
I've got the name of the man.

25:13.726 --> 25:14.848
The New York Review, or?

25:14.888 --> 25:15.889
No, the New Yorker.

25:15.969 --> 25:17.671
Oh, the New Yorker, Nicholson Baker.

25:17.912 --> 25:18.653
Yes, that's right.

25:18.673 --> 25:19.073
Yes.

25:19.574 --> 25:21.656
And San Francisco, particularly.

25:21.737 --> 25:22.918
Yes, that's right.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.922
Yes, I was out in San Francisco, and that was .

25:26.037 --> 25:30.401
Yeah, that's fascinating, but it's even more pervasive than that.

25:30.422 --> 25:37.649
You even have it on the university level, which is, Baker was talking specifically about the San Francisco Public Library.

25:37.749 --> 25:39.191
Yeah, yeah.

25:39.211 --> 25:40.792
Well, he did two articles.

25:40.952 --> 25:47.459
He did two, one within the last three or four months, actually, in October, which he was refiled.

25:47.479 --> 25:55.167
Well, it's difficult to take a line on that, because the problem is the deliberation of publication.

25:56.260 --> 26:03.989
I mean, in this country, we published 90,000 titles last year.

26:04.990 --> 26:06.632
That's more than, I think, the U.S.

26:06.652 --> 26:06.972
did.

26:06.992 --> 26:07.192
Yeah.

26:07.633 --> 26:08.414
Oh, yes, certainly.

26:09.275 --> 26:09.976
That's amazing.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.057
Yeah.

26:11.077 --> 26:15.782
And we've got six copyright licenses.

26:15.802 --> 26:20.548
Bodleian accessions, a mile and a half of Sherpas every year.

26:23.571 --> 26:23.651
Wow.

26:23.671 --> 26:25.373
I mean, it's going to blow up.

26:25.673 --> 26:29.157
Do they have a depository?

26:29.177 --> 26:30.219
Yes.

26:30.279 --> 26:35.545
I've been to the one that Harvard made, but we lived, fortunately, just about 10 miles away.

26:35.605 --> 26:42.534
No, I mean the problem of the Great Library, I think, is really serious.

26:42.614 --> 26:46.338
I mean, within 10 years, they'll burst.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.302
No doubt.

26:50.024 --> 26:53.227
So you think it is inevitable that a lot of this will have to be?

26:53.527 --> 27:05.759
Well, I think in practical terms, my solution would be to have a national archive of the book, which would be simply a resource.

27:07.601 --> 27:16.369
And that would allow the six copyright libraries to work on a selective basis.

27:16.449 --> 27:19.592
And that, of course, just exposes the problem, I mean.

27:20.382 --> 27:25.106
They reckon a library doubles in size every 16 years.

27:25.126 --> 27:26.928
Wow.

27:26.948 --> 27:30.131
So there is a real problem, isn't there?

27:30.912 --> 27:34.495
I'm glad I'm an excellent person.

27:34.515 --> 27:38.739
Well, is there a lot of replication among the six libraries?

27:38.759 --> 27:40.181
Well, yes.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.142
They don't take everything now.

27:43.264 --> 27:46.947
Oddly, for example, doesn't take

27:47.500 --> 27:54.288
other than a few national and local newspapers, though they're entitled.

27:55.009 --> 28:00.916
But the British Museum has to take a lot, because that is the legal deposit library.

28:01.436 --> 28:10.287
If there's any law case involving books, it's the British Museum copy that has to be presented in court.

28:10.307 --> 28:12.449
It's an archive.

28:12.670 --> 28:13.230
Really?

28:13.250 --> 28:13.451
Yeah.

28:14.051 --> 28:15.533
But what it doesn't, I mean,

28:15.783 --> 28:17.465
I don't know what proportion.

28:17.485 --> 28:22.871
They probably accession about 60,000 or 70,000 books a year.

28:22.891 --> 28:23.071
Wow.

28:23.692 --> 28:32.341
So there is some sort of code or law on the books that says there must be at least one physical copy of everything, which is retained.

28:32.481 --> 28:32.982
Yes.

28:33.402 --> 28:37.427
The legal deposit copy, which is the British Library copy.

28:37.447 --> 28:40.390
I mean, if you publish anything, you have...

28:41.416 --> 28:46.903
a legal obligation to deposit one copy with the British Library.

28:46.923 --> 29:01.463
And the other five copies that go to Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Wales, and believe it or not, Ireland, British College something, those are claimed on their behalf by an agent.

29:02.665 --> 29:06.630
But the deposit copy you have to send to the British Library.

29:07.943 --> 29:11.409
I don't know if we have a system like that.

29:11.449 --> 29:16.998
The Library of Congress, but libraries like Harvard and California.

29:17.219 --> 29:18.902
No, they don't have it.

29:19.443 --> 29:24.912
But if they do it, it's strictly because they want to do it.

29:25.012 --> 29:27.336
Harvard maintains a policy of

29:27.873 --> 29:31.599
There is no such thing as a dead book at Harvard, which I love.

29:31.699 --> 29:36.988
They do keep one, and they put it out to sleep out there.

29:37.008 --> 29:46.002
I have also run into an attitude at the University of Michigan, for instance, where they have actually looked and they said, well, when's the last time this book was used?

29:46.864 --> 29:50.910
If it hasn't been used in five years, they look at it.

29:52.192 --> 29:54.015
I mean, they consider whether or not

29:54.333 --> 29:57.056
we should keep, which to me is wrong-headed.

29:57.076 --> 29:58.257
It may be needed tomorrow.

29:58.278 --> 30:00.400
It may be needed 20 years from now.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.624
But they're wondering if they can afford the luxury of doing that.

30:04.505 --> 30:08.609
Of course, it does cost money to keep them.

30:08.629 --> 30:10.632
And they call these books, what-if books.

30:11.793 --> 30:14.516
What if somebody needs it, should we keep it?

30:15.297 --> 30:20.183
And then at Columbia, they tell me now they have a category of medium-rare, kind of cute.

30:20.203 --> 30:24.087
They have rare books, general circulating books, and somewhere in the middle,

30:24.623 --> 30:34.855
There are these books that are becoming aged, fragile, and so they don't allow them to circulate, but they do segregate them.

30:34.875 --> 30:44.766
And they will allow students to look at them there, but a decision will be made on an individual basis if they'll allow them to go through the Xerox copier, for instance.

30:44.786 --> 30:49.551
So they actually have designated a classification for them.

30:50.392 --> 30:51.894
How do you feel, though?

30:51.914 --> 31:00.682
I mean, do you have a personal feeling about the printed book, vis-a-vis, the computerized book, the virtual library?

31:01.163 --> 31:10.993
Would it bother you if I told you there was a new college established in the United States that didn't even have a library in the plans, in the architecture?

31:11.013 --> 31:20.382
It was a computer center, that books weren't part of the equation?

31:21.205 --> 31:25.790
And they aren't even calling these buildings libraries anymore.

31:25.810 --> 31:27.592
They're calling them resource centers.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.175
What's your attitude on that kind of bit?

31:31.336 --> 31:36.341
Well, I'm an excellent bit.

31:36.361 --> 31:36.701
Whatever.

31:36.841 --> 31:49.795
I mean, the great thing is that all this computerization and mechanization of information is a good servant with a bad master.

31:51.158 --> 31:58.188
And I think one's got to think very clearly about it.

31:58.328 --> 32:09.103
My recipe is never buy any computer equipment, because it will be out of date in three years.

32:10.245 --> 32:13.810
And you mean, oh, you mean specifically at a university library.

32:14.471 --> 32:15.452
So don't buy it at all.

32:17.115 --> 32:17.976
See, I don't.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.523
No, it's not a serious solution.

32:22.464 --> 32:30.814
But people must keep their head about computerization and be absolutely clear what they want.

32:30.834 --> 32:35.579
And then use computerization as one way of getting it.

32:35.599 --> 32:45.991
If it's better, if people think it's better to have the physical book, then they should be able to do it.

32:46.011 --> 32:48.013
What is your attitude on the physical book?

32:48.483 --> 32:49.726
very much so.

32:49.746 --> 33:05.319
I mean, to me it's almost a holy object because it's essentially a registration of the experience of past generations.

33:05.339 --> 33:09.327
And you don't think that in a similar vein that the computer would be able to

33:09.762 --> 33:11.524
to perform that function.

33:11.544 --> 33:14.367
And of course, there are also technical problems.

33:14.387 --> 33:15.788
Major technical problems.

33:15.808 --> 33:22.515
Yes, I mean, you may suddenly find that you lost all your books because of the power source.

33:22.595 --> 33:27.220
Well, it does happen when you go into a library and they say computers are down today.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.321
Yes, that's right.

33:28.341 --> 33:29.082
The computers are done.

33:29.102 --> 33:32.025
You can't access for an hour, an hour and a half.

33:32.065 --> 33:36.710
So for 90 minutes, these books effectively don't exist.

33:36.810 --> 33:38.672
It needs very clear thinking.

33:38.956 --> 33:48.606
One mustn't be taken in by the computer sellers whose interest it is to sell you.

33:48.626 --> 33:51.949
And we do know that paper lasts.

33:52.029 --> 33:57.034
We have history to show that books can last for several hundred years.

33:57.315 --> 33:59.977
And if it doesn't last, then there can be a week of years.

34:00.017 --> 34:00.518
That's right.

34:00.538 --> 34:04.582
But for computer technology, 30, 40, 50 years.

34:04.742 --> 34:08.406
And they have gone through several generations where

34:08.977 --> 34:14.142
material that has been stored on one system is inaccessible by today's machines.

34:14.242 --> 34:16.024
Take the card, the punched cards.

34:16.224 --> 34:17.905
Cornell has millions of these cards.

34:18.246 --> 34:22.830
They can't access the information in the cards because they no longer have the machines there.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.852
So what good is the information?

34:24.892 --> 34:28.055
No, I think in general, small is beautiful.

34:31.238 --> 34:35.862
But I agree that the problem of the great copyright

34:36.483 --> 34:39.890
It is the most serious one.

34:41.253 --> 34:50.653
And the handling of very large number of units, you see, probably has got no choice.

34:50.673 --> 34:54.441
It's going to use mechanical means of control.

34:55.045 --> 34:57.549
And so, where is Bodley deposited in New Orleans?

34:57.569 --> 35:00.934
You said a mile and a half of shelving per year, if necessary?

35:00.954 --> 35:01.154
Yeah.

35:01.375 --> 35:09.066
Well, out in the country about ten miles out, Newnham-Courtney, they've got, I think they've built a second one now.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.069
And this is where?

35:11.129 --> 35:12.471
Newnham-Courtney.

35:12.812 --> 35:17.139
How do we spell Newnham?

35:20.584 --> 35:23.348
C-N-E-W-N-H-A-M-Courtney, C-O-U-R-T-N-E-Y.

35:24.560 --> 35:28.385
That's where the depository is.

35:28.525 --> 35:29.046
Yes.

35:29.066 --> 35:32.991
They built, I think, two units, and they're now starting on the back.

35:33.231 --> 35:43.544
Library of Congress, of course, is going from the Jefferson Building to the Madison Building to the Adams Building, and now they're going to go out for a place out in Maryland, I guess.

35:44.285 --> 35:51.073
It's a great problem, but they've got to keep their heads and not to be swung by.

35:51.323 --> 36:03.997
I don't know, I don't think that they actually did that.

36:04.037 --> 36:14.328
Were there any similar considerations here?

36:14.428 --> 36:19.373
No, unfortunately.

36:19.910 --> 36:25.556
I'm not sure what happened, particularly about the manuscripts, whether they were moved.

36:25.576 --> 36:37.828
But I know the printed books were not moved, and in an incendiary debate, a very large number and a quarter of a million volumes were lost.

36:38.109 --> 36:40.251
Yes, a British language.

36:40.271 --> 36:45.276
And unfortunately, they included

36:45.948 --> 36:58.601
periodical section in which the letter R was much effective and that all of Ruska and Ruska, Ruska, Ruska, Slava, all destroyed.

36:59.321 --> 37:14.757
That was in fact one of the reasons why I was appointed here to try and get them for Oxford so that at least there was one copy in this country before the war they almost certainly had the only copy.

37:15.715 --> 37:17.618
And did you find any of that?

37:17.678 --> 37:22.106
This is material that you went to Eastern Europe.

37:22.146 --> 37:27.274
I exchanged volume for volume, Russian periodicals for English people.

37:27.294 --> 37:30.860
And you developed the desiderata yourself?

37:31.401 --> 37:32.804
Oh yes.

37:32.824 --> 37:36.690
I produced 150 desiderata lists.

37:36.710 --> 37:41.318
And of course this comes from your own knowledge and expertise in the field.

37:41.618 --> 37:43.660
And what do you look for when you try?

37:43.700 --> 37:49.527
You used the phrase earlier in the interview, retrospectively strengthen a collection.

37:49.547 --> 37:51.769
I like that phrase.

37:52.009 --> 37:56.975
Well, it's essentially identifying the caps.

37:58.496 --> 37:59.257
How do you do that?

38:01.119 --> 38:04.203
In my case, I knew the literature doing well.

38:04.243 --> 38:08.267
And if you want to do it mechanically, you get

38:08.534 --> 38:35.588
outstanding monographs in different fields and you go through their full notes and see the sources that they are quoting and you can build up from that pretty good news I mean I think certainly over 10 years I got nearly 10,000 projects from Russia

38:35.720 --> 38:40.945
Europe and pretty good stuff.

38:41.365 --> 38:47.971
And of course I had the job of looking at similar material.

38:48.312 --> 38:52.976
I think I said four complete sets of countries.

38:54.177 --> 38:58.721
They're about 250 volumes each.

38:59.502 --> 39:05.187
Very rightly wanted as raw materials for social history.

39:05.538 --> 39:11.365
Do you find now that you get scholars coming here from Eastern Europe to study their own history and culture?

39:12.106 --> 39:12.607
Yes, a lot.

39:13.067 --> 39:25.742
Well, of course, most of them come to study emigre subjects because they haven't got material in Russia because they either didn't collect it or it was prescribed.

39:25.803 --> 39:33.672
And although I think that the system of special collections, what they call spitzkraming,

39:34.242 --> 39:35.824
has now gone.

39:35.844 --> 39:36.765
They are now open.

39:37.526 --> 39:44.936
They weren't getting a lot of emigranity, and there's a proliferation of Russians.

39:44.956 --> 39:48.540
We've had a lot here, and we'll have them in America.

39:48.600 --> 40:02.558
People are studying the culture of the emigration, which is, of course, not without interest, because the emigration included a lot of number of outstanding scholars and thinkers.

40:03.079 --> 40:04.080
You were here...

40:05.005 --> 40:15.561
to observe the immediate post-war activities, where apparently books, manuscripts, were treated as hard currency.

40:15.862 --> 40:30.625
I mean, there was a movement of material in North America, because in Eastern Europe, even here, they were able to come in and buy huge volumes of books.

40:31.668 --> 40:33.311
Do you have a comment on that?

40:33.331 --> 40:35.214
I mean, is this something that you observe?

40:35.234 --> 40:40.682
Is this something that you observe happening now in Russia and in Eastern European countries?

40:40.823 --> 40:42.625
I just don't know about now.

40:42.706 --> 40:57.048
I mean, the great time, of course, was after the first one, when Archibald Coolidge went, Harry Leidenberg from New York Public Library went.

40:58.831 --> 40:59.312
I think

41:00.068 --> 41:06.934
Jan Malinsky was head of the Slomonic section of the New York Public Library.

41:06.954 --> 41:20.046
He went to Lithuania and bought an extremely important collection of Russian books, simply for dollars, presumably.

41:20.066 --> 41:23.069
But Abe Kassinac has written on this.

41:23.129 --> 41:23.569
He has.

41:24.050 --> 41:27.193
Exactly, and I have some of his articles.

41:27.233 --> 41:29.755
They're very interesting.

41:30.595 --> 41:34.439
But after the... I never bought, I think.

41:34.459 --> 41:41.527
Well, I bought in shops, stuff, but I never bought from libraries.

41:41.547 --> 41:43.189
We always exchanged libraries.

41:43.649 --> 41:48.495
They were keener to get Western publications than to get money.

41:49.355 --> 41:52.459
They had bags of Russian money.

41:52.479 --> 41:55.102
Now, of course, they've pretty well nothing.

41:55.122 --> 41:57.244
Yeah, and now the problem over there, of course, is theft.

41:58.005 --> 41:58.105
Yeah.

41:59.182 --> 42:04.988
And then apparently the condition of materials is deplorable, and that's really frightening.

42:05.729 --> 42:09.873
Folks who just don't enjoy a high priority, apparently.

42:10.954 --> 42:16.179
I was at a dinner at the New York Public Library with Paul McClergate for Zaitsev.

42:17.340 --> 42:19.082
And of course, he was there now.

42:19.222 --> 42:25.088
He's an old-time bureaucrat, government person.

42:25.658 --> 42:28.482
really trying to find ways to raise money.

42:28.502 --> 42:37.475
He's in the uncommon position of figuring out how to get... Well, you see, there's no estate money, you see, because nobody pays their taxes.

42:38.857 --> 42:42.382
And the situation with the staffs is affording.

42:42.402 --> 42:43.904
They're not paid.

42:44.265 --> 42:46.248
They're months behind.

42:46.368 --> 42:53.438
How would you, from what you've heard, judge the state of the book?

42:53.654 --> 43:09.072
culture apparatus in Russia and Eastern Europe now, where they are, they have such a low priority where people aren't being paid, where books aren't being taken care of, never mind buying new things, but just taking care of what they have.

43:09.994 --> 43:11.435
Well, they do what they can.

43:11.575 --> 43:18.203
You see, they've still got very dedicated people, but they haven't got the means.

43:18.223 --> 43:20.867
And, of course, it does vary from country to country.

43:20.887 --> 43:22.108
You can't generalize anything.

43:22.342 --> 43:28.728
in Czechoslovakia and Poland, the situation is probably very difficult.

43:28.908 --> 43:36.915
Russia has got an economy which they're attempting to stand on its head.

43:36.935 --> 43:41.380
It was never the case with Poland and Czechoslovakia.

43:41.580 --> 43:44.683
Communism was not so well dug in.

43:45.944 --> 43:51.589
And they were able to make the transition a little bit more gracefully, I guess.

43:51.772 --> 44:06.888
And early in this new book, I'm also hoping to, in a narrative form, discuss wonderful libraries through history, but the significance of each one along the way.

44:06.928 --> 44:12.134
And generally, you mentioned, say, Gaul in Switzerland.

44:12.154 --> 44:15.377
We had this great monastic scriptorium.

44:15.397 --> 44:17.880
I'm going to look to Durham Library in this book.

44:18.299 --> 44:23.465
a great example of a cathedral library that survived the... Well, Hereford, of course.

44:23.485 --> 44:26.248
And Hereford, of course, out in the West survived.

44:26.308 --> 44:31.093
And they still have an active chain library, as I understand.

44:31.113 --> 44:46.230
Could you recommend any libraries, or can you think of any libraries that you would particularly recommend that we... Because it might be not only beautiful to describe... Well, if you're going to Eastern Europe, you must

44:46.733 --> 44:48.977
I mean, it's fairly simple.

44:48.997 --> 45:01.356
You must certainly visit national libraries because all of them have got the remains of centralized policy.

45:01.376 --> 45:08.307
I mean, the national library will know what's going on because that was part of the old setup.

45:08.327 --> 45:11.112
And they're rare book departments.

45:11.512 --> 45:14.597
Other people want to tackle the making.

45:14.999 --> 45:21.808
give you the lowdown, you'll be English speakers, I imagine.

45:21.828 --> 45:30.198
In Prague, for example, there's marvelous libraries, 16th century libraries.

45:30.218 --> 45:36.186
In Poland, at Gornik, again, wonderful libraries.

45:38.709 --> 45:42.694
Yugoslavia, I don't know what's happened there, but anyway,

45:43.400 --> 45:46.324
extremely difficult.

45:47.145 --> 45:53.493
But again, you go to the national libraries and tell them what you're interested in.

45:53.573 --> 45:56.376
They will tell you what's going on.

45:56.937 --> 45:58.519
Yeah.

45:58.539 --> 46:00.001
Do you think of anything?

46:04.006 --> 46:05.668
This has really been wonderful.

46:06.609 --> 46:12.597
But I won't bother you with the Russian literature.

46:13.184 --> 46:23.461
But for the literature of the history of libraries, there's an annual bibliography.

46:25.745 --> 46:32.356
Annual bibliography of the history of the book.

46:33.257 --> 46:34.379
No, general.

46:34.820 --> 46:35.441
Really?

46:35.461 --> 46:36.983
Yeah.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.226
It's published in English?

46:38.246 --> 46:39.748
No, it's published in English.

46:43.137 --> 46:45.740
That's a UK publication?

46:45.940 --> 46:48.743
I think it's published in Holland.

46:49.844 --> 46:51.446
And it's called a bibliography?

46:51.466 --> 46:54.309
Annual bibliography of the history of the book.

46:54.329 --> 46:56.431
There are about 20 volumes so far.

46:56.571 --> 47:03.939
The last volume, I suppose, rather behind is probably about 19, covering 1995.

47:06.242 --> 47:10.326
But it has a section, you see, on libraries, history of libraries.

47:10.492 --> 47:14.857
which includes, by and large, the literature.

47:14.937 --> 47:20.864
That's the thing you really want to get hold of, and you'll get references.

47:21.785 --> 47:32.356
For Russia, there's an annual bibliography, but it's in Russian, and it's in a publication called Kniga, A-N-I-G-A.

47:35.380 --> 47:40.245
One thing that Edward mentioned, which you might be able to comment authoritatively on,

47:40.580 --> 48:10.266
that during the Soviet period he said that the practice was, and the phrase he used, to bring to the center the treasures from many of the various republics and nationalities, to attempt to make a national, a Soviet kind of a library, a history, a repository of all these different cultures and nationalities throughout the Soviet Union.

48:11.208 --> 48:21.879
And you said, for instance, now with the dissolution of the Union, you find, for instance, a lot of Ukrainian treasures remain in Moscow or St.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.963
Petersburg, and that maybe they're attempting now to get these things back.

48:26.964 --> 48:28.886
Are you familiar with this sort of practice?

48:28.926 --> 48:38.616
Well, certainly, Ukrainians would be very anxious to get any stuff from Russia.

48:39.170 --> 48:41.492
I mean, there's no love lost.

48:41.612 --> 48:52.121
The Ukrainians are not cheery about the importance of their own cultural heritage.

48:52.301 --> 48:54.003
But centralization.

48:59.427 --> 49:08.755
What's relevant, I think, is the bibliographical control in Russia by the all-Union book chamber that was

49:09.562 --> 49:39.552
and that was responsible for recording week by week publication of books and periodicals and articles in journals and that covered the whole of the Soviet Union until its breakup and it still exists but of course is now reduced to Russia and the other states are responsible for their own

49:40.072 --> 49:42.415
geographical control.

49:42.515 --> 49:45.820
And they were during the Soviet period, or they are now?

49:45.840 --> 49:48.504
Yes, it was a duplicated business.

49:48.544 --> 49:51.949
So they probably didn't lose as much as... No, no.

49:52.109 --> 50:05.348
I don't know whether there's anything recent in English on that, but I bought for you to see this journal.

50:05.368 --> 50:06.630
Have you come across that?

50:06.650 --> 50:07.511
No, let me just write it down.

50:07.531 --> 50:08.172
Oh, that

50:08.624 --> 50:09.065
Oh, wow.

50:09.285 --> 50:10.887
I should be able to find this in New York.

50:11.027 --> 50:11.788
Oh, yes, it's there.

50:11.848 --> 50:16.154
I think Ed is one of the... Okay, we'll keep going.

50:16.214 --> 50:18.437
S-O-L... A-N-U-S.

50:26.267 --> 50:31.433
It's published in London, volume 1 to 10.

50:31.554 --> 50:37.281
That will be 1987 onwards.

50:38.678 --> 50:40.041
It comes out each year.

50:41.665 --> 50:44.593
And you want to go through the whole of the set.

50:45.635 --> 50:48.442
International journal for Russian and East European.

50:49.044 --> 50:52.332
They'll know it in New York.

50:53.795 --> 50:56.502
But you see here this sort of thing.

50:57.477 --> 51:00.260
Oh, that's absolutely essential.

51:00.540 --> 51:01.201
Which one is this?

51:01.221 --> 51:02.402
This is volume 10.

51:02.522 --> 51:04.064
This is the last one.

51:04.124 --> 51:06.246
Yeah, that article in particular.

51:06.266 --> 51:12.312
I just learned that during that period when there was no Poland, that the National Library was in Paris.

51:14.114 --> 51:15.095
That's very interesting.

51:15.115 --> 51:20.000
And, of course, there's a very good Polish library in London.

51:20.020 --> 51:20.240
Really?

51:20.360 --> 51:22.002
Yes, you ought to go and see them.

51:23.504 --> 51:24.384
I've forgotten.

51:24.785 --> 51:25.806
I don't know if there was nothing.

51:26.206 --> 51:26.927
It used to be.

51:27.262 --> 51:34.330
a man called Jakub Borbic, who was a librarian, simply at the Polish Library in London.

51:34.350 --> 51:41.598
And they maintained the bibliography of the Polish emigre material from 1939.

51:41.798 --> 51:45.062
I'm going to give you my card.

51:45.082 --> 51:51.569
Do you mind if I give you a call at some point after I have a chance to transcribe this tape?

51:52.310 --> 51:54.332
And that usually I think is the better way to...

51:55.038 --> 52:01.189
go over my material and then maybe ask a few more detailed questions about giving us an hour.

52:01.349 --> 52:07.760
Well, I haven't exhausted you, I have.

52:07.880 --> 52:09.643
Really, I'm delighted we were able to do this.

52:09.984 --> 52:15.814
It's wonderful insights.

52:17.937 --> 52:19.879
because there's a lot of material.

52:19.919 --> 52:23.463
Yeah, and it'll be a nice companion to my earlier work.

52:23.723 --> 52:42.223
Yes, but I think if you do get in touch with these emigre libraries that still exist, I mean, there's a Ukrainian one in New York, and the Lithuanian one, and the Lithuanian one, those are the

52:42.575 --> 52:50.266
where you'll find people who really know the form, because they will be librarians and they will be natives of those countries.

52:50.286 --> 52:55.994
And they will be able to talk about preserving their culture, not only through the book, but by taking the book out.

52:56.394 --> 52:58.858
They'll talk to you about that.

53:01.401 --> 53:06.388
And you're fortunate, you see, because you'll have representatives of every immigrant,

53:06.757 --> 53:09.461
community actually in New York.

53:09.481 --> 53:10.663
Yeah, they all went to New York.

53:11.183 --> 53:11.604
Yeah.

53:11.624 --> 53:19.596
I did this with Dr. Gregorian, bartender Gregorian, and he's going back to New York now to head up the Carnegie Corporation.

53:19.616 --> 53:19.936
Oh, yeah.

53:19.996 --> 53:22.700
And he said, you must come again to New York.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.884
He said, everything and everybody is there.

53:25.044 --> 53:28.228
It is quite literally the site of the United Nations.

53:30.532 --> 53:31.874
Good.

53:31.894 --> 53:34.097
Now, I'll give you this.

53:36.625 --> 53:40.369
a little thing on the history of the college.

53:40.389 --> 53:41.631
Oh, wonderful.

53:41.651 --> 53:45.495
And also on the library, a little thing there.

53:46.597 --> 53:48.899
Now, what are you going to do for the rest of the day?

53:48.919 --> 53:51.803
Oh, we're going to walk around, maybe go to Bodley.

53:51.963 --> 53:53.004
Yeah, go to Bodley.

53:53.044 --> 53:54.786
They have tours, by the way.

53:54.927 --> 53:55.748
It's worth doing.

53:57.289 --> 54:03.797
And if you want to do a tour, there is a coach tour of Oxford.

54:04.267 --> 54:06.809
which you can pick up anywhere on it.

54:06.849 --> 54:09.231
It'll last about an hour and a half, I think.

54:09.752 --> 54:13.575
I think, really, we're going to go through Bodley and maybe go back to London.

54:13.595 --> 54:14.356
Yes.

54:14.376 --> 54:14.736
Okay.

54:14.756 --> 54:17.198
See if we can get another interview down there this afternoon.

54:18.339 --> 54:19.560
That's very kind of you, Doctor.

54:19.620 --> 54:20.961
No, not at all.

54:21.182 --> 54:28.027
It's so kind of you to come in and see us at such short notice.

54:28.388 --> 54:28.908
Yes.

54:29.909 --> 54:33.312
Udin was a very rich Siberian

54:34.017 --> 54:43.952
who owned an alcohol monopoly and collected books on a grand scale.

54:44.613 --> 54:50.241
And after his death, they were offered to the Russian Academy of Sciences.

54:50.261 --> 54:53.085
They were in Siberia, in Khabarovsk.

54:54.047 --> 54:56.350
And the Academy turned it down.

54:57.492 --> 55:01.037
And at the Library of Congress at that time,

55:01.523 --> 55:10.293
was a very lively Russian Liberian, and he arranged for purchase for the Library of Congress, where they are now.

55:11.074 --> 55:13.456
And it's an extremely important collection.

55:13.476 --> 55:15.338
I gave a talk at the Library of Congress.

55:15.418 --> 55:23.167
Remember there was a gentleman who stood up in the back and said, this, he told me that same precise, I think it was like seven boxcars of material.

55:23.247 --> 55:23.628
Yes, that's right.

55:23.728 --> 55:27.552
And it is, remains a valued collection at the library.

55:27.572 --> 55:28.493
I have information on it.

55:28.979 --> 55:36.250
It wasn't, I may say, catalogued for many years, but now it's all catalogued.

55:36.310 --> 55:51.612
He collected all the 19th century government reports, you see, Russian government reports, and very often the Library of Congress has unique copies outside Russia.
