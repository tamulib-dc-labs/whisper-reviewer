00:03.018 --> 00:05.873
I'm going to have to borrow a couple of quarters from you

00:06.123 --> 00:19.216
I'm a doctoral student at UC Berkeley in the Geography Department.

00:19.376 --> 00:22.740
I'm E-R-A-Y, right?

00:22.760 --> 00:23.140
G-R-A-Y.

00:24.081 --> 00:25.603
B-R-E-C-H-I-N.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.305
B-R-E-C-H-I-N.

00:27.325 --> 00:29.507
That's me.

00:30.027 --> 00:33.571
Okay, good.

00:33.591 --> 00:34.712
And I was a...

00:34.692 --> 00:45.602
I was a journalist and a TV producer in San Francisco in the 1980s when the new library was being planned.

00:45.622 --> 00:48.284
And I was a writer of that one.

00:48.384 --> 00:52.608
Oh, thanks very much.

00:52.628 --> 01:02.877
And I just want to say before we start that it's great that you've said this because as you get into this, as James Chakey says whenâ€” Sure, a little bit.

01:03.785 --> 01:13.636
When we first started into all this, Chafee said at a coffee that we were having that, you know, you get into this and it will consume you.

01:13.736 --> 01:15.157
And in fact, it did.

01:15.217 --> 01:21.484
It consumed many of us because you need a reality check every once in a while because you can't believe that this is actually happening.

01:21.504 --> 01:23.727
You know, it seems so surreal.

01:24.608 --> 01:32.256
And one of the strangest things that happened was, and this is what we were just talking about, the analogy we made, is that

01:32.725 --> 01:43.229
In Nick's talk, he subtly makes the analogy of sending books off to the dump to what happened to Jews during the war.

01:43.369 --> 01:46.937
It's somewhat subtle.

01:49.668 --> 01:55.635
It had been given to him by the librarians in the San Francisco public.

01:55.655 --> 02:07.829
So a letter went out, and I guess you haven't seen this letter, but in the attempt to destroy Nick, Nick's reputation, after the May 30th talk at the library.

02:07.969 --> 02:10.432
May 30th, 96th.

02:11.053 --> 02:13.836
Yeah, 96th, a great talk.

02:14.137 --> 02:42.182
And also about that time, a branch librarian named Colba Singer in San Francisco wrote a scathing editorial in The Examiner, an op-ed piece, about how the new main library showed how the whole system was being commercialized and how it had betrayed the trust of the people.

02:42.202 --> 02:43.063
Shortly after that, I think it was in June,

02:44.258 --> 03:01.187
A three-page single-spaced letter went out from the Library Foundation, signed without letterhead, signed by eight members of the Library Foundation, accusing Toba of homophobia and accusing Nick because of his analogy of anti-Semitism.

03:01.522 --> 03:16.618
and anti-Semitism because he had dared to make this analogy and that it had, I guess, belittled the Holocaust by making that analogy.

03:17.639 --> 03:21.263
To this day, nobody knows who wrote that letter.

03:21.363 --> 03:29.031
It went out through official channels to all librarians in the system without letter here.

03:29.011 --> 03:36.278
I'm almost certain myself that it was Steve Coulter who wrote that letter.

03:36.378 --> 03:42.783
Because it's the same identity politics that he uses to divide people.

03:43.184 --> 03:44.565
That's great.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.868
Identity politics.

03:47.888 --> 03:48.709
I was looking for a description.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.812
Because this is all Utah.

03:51.852 --> 03:54.474
I'll tell you a little bit.

03:54.494 --> 03:56.956
He sticks with the women, by the way.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.018
I gave him a chance to modify his description there.

03:58.998 --> 04:13.213
Well, no, no, it's true.

04:13.233 --> 04:24.786
I mean, because it's so strange to watch him do this as head of the Library Commission because it's so divisive and at the same time he's posing as a

04:25.643 --> 04:32.514
San Francisco liberal, and yet he's making these incredibly racist and divisive statements.

04:32.774 --> 04:36.059
And that's not what the library is about.

04:36.099 --> 04:37.842
The library, obviously, should be inclusive.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.606
And so really, it's an amazing twist of logic.

04:40.626 --> 04:42.589
But they've been doing this for quite some time.

04:42.610 --> 04:46.716
That was the first attempt to destroy Nick, his reputation.

04:47.076 --> 04:51.904
The other ones that happened were before his article came out in the New Yorker.

04:54.230 --> 04:57.453
Our catalog story of the second one.

04:57.493 --> 04:58.114
The second one.

04:58.134 --> 04:59.235
They knew it was coming out.

04:59.315 --> 05:03.058
I didn't realize that they had, in fact, contacted the New Yorker.

05:03.098 --> 05:16.591
But meanwhile, back in San Francisco, they launched a preemptive campaign against Baker, accusing him of being an opportunist, an out-of-towner who would come to the city to make money and make a name for himself.

05:16.892 --> 05:20.355
There were letters to the editor, which is really funny.

05:20.335 --> 05:21.256
Which is funny.

05:21.396 --> 05:21.796
Oh, yeah.

05:21.816 --> 05:24.118
The man makes his living as a novelist.

05:24.138 --> 05:24.238
Sure.

05:24.539 --> 05:25.500
As well, I'm sure.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.180
Let's see.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.762
What was... Oh, yes.

05:27.782 --> 05:31.105
There's nobody hotter than Nick Baker right now, by the way.

05:31.125 --> 05:31.965
That's good to know.

05:32.786 --> 05:37.310
Well, I mean, and that's why it was such a brave thing for him to do, to go out on this limb.

05:37.851 --> 05:48.300
And for Tilly Olsen, too, because one thing that has disappointed me about the local writing community is they're the only well-known writers who ain't shocked and spoken out.

05:48.584 --> 05:58.604
There are a number of other people who could have done so, but they didn't.

05:58.624 --> 06:01.209
Amy Tam... Do you?

06:01.229 --> 06:03.593
I'm curious to see what... Oh, Isabelle Allende.

06:03.774 --> 06:05.477
She was about peace involved.

06:05.497 --> 06:05.918
She wrote it forward.

06:06.758 --> 06:13.644
the history of the library.

06:13.884 --> 06:21.912
And she's quoted, they interviewed her in the tape that T.Q.E.D.

06:21.932 --> 06:22.012
did.

06:22.032 --> 06:22.893
She talks about how inclusive the thing is.

06:22.913 --> 06:32.361
Well, sure, there are these affinity rooms that are really money.

06:32.381 --> 06:33.662
I mean, they're pretty, you know, but what the hell is in there?

06:33.682 --> 06:36.765
And you're really allowing the course of intellectual inquiry to be determined by whoever is willing to put up X amount of dollars to establish them.

06:40.154 --> 06:45.658
Well, I think the main thing is that some of them are pretty.

06:46.162 --> 07:13.063
you know gays and lesbians won because they gave more money and so you go from there to the adjacent room which is the black american room um gays gave over three million dollars um blacks gave only about half a million so there's not even a sign i believe the last time i was there there wasn't even a sign that identified that as the african-american i did not see no no it's just like a reading room but the most important thing is that there are no librarians

07:13.043 --> 07:19.690
In any of those rooms, there's an expensive desk and a chair with a sign that says, if you need help, go and find a librarian.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.452
But there's no specialized librarian.

07:21.752 --> 07:26.437
For people who are doing gay and lesbian research, you know, in San Francisco, that's important.

07:26.457 --> 07:27.398
They've got a good collection.

07:27.558 --> 07:29.440
There's nobody there to help them.

07:29.480 --> 07:37.228
There was supposed to be Jim Van Buster, who largely put together that collection this year yesterday.

07:40.313 --> 07:49.591
They should have been the curator of that collection, but that's shameful for a collection which has been endowed with over $3 million.

07:49.812 --> 07:55.403
They don't even have a specialized librarian to help either.

07:56.142 --> 08:03.273
that none of the well-known writers except Nick and Tilly have spoken out on this issue.

08:03.293 --> 08:09.503
And it may just be that they are, like I was, embarrassed when they found out about the good result.

08:09.523 --> 08:15.533
But then that would be, should be, I think, even more of a reason that they should have spoken out about this betrayal.

08:16.114 --> 08:20.040
Because it was a betrayal of everything that we extensively believed in.

08:21.134 --> 08:37.659
Would you say you're involved in the struggle?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.523
I don't know what else to call it.

08:40.543 --> 08:40.944
Are you an observer?

08:40.964 --> 08:41.124
Tell me.

08:41.144 --> 08:41.845
Well, of course, you gave a speech.

08:41.865 --> 08:43.768
You were on the endocrine, as they might say, in boxing.

08:43.788 --> 08:45.791
Nick was the main event that you were on the endocrine.

08:45.811 --> 08:46.572
With sort of his backbeat, taking off.

08:46.592 --> 08:46.652
Oh.

08:46.987 --> 08:52.436
But it was a privilege to do that.

08:52.456 --> 08:56.722
You have a text of what you said, right?

08:56.742 --> 09:00.769
You have a text of what you said.

09:00.789 --> 09:01.990
Oh, it's right here.

09:02.011 --> 09:02.151
Yeah.

09:02.171 --> 09:05.236
So, well, my role in this actually began in 1985 when I was writing for Focus Magazine in San Francisco.

09:05.256 --> 09:07.459
I had a regular column in Focus called Cityscapes.

09:08.452 --> 09:35.978
which was mostly urban design criticism, but I saw a letter to the editor and the examiner that said, why are we spending so, why is Diane Feinstein, mayor, spending so much money trying to get a major sports team, a sports stadium in San Francisco, in the main library, that's falling apart to disgrace for a major world-class city, which is going to still like to think of itself as being, well, I took that as a,

09:36.903 --> 09:46.936
to write a column about the need for a new library.

09:46.956 --> 09:51.642
And Feinstein was furious from what I hear.

09:51.662 --> 09:57.309
So he immediately called up the library and asked who had put me up to this.

09:58.271 --> 10:00.894
And in the library, nobody really knew who I was.

10:00.914 --> 10:01.715
It was just this columnist.

10:01.735 --> 10:02.556
So it apparently hit some sort of target.

10:02.576 --> 10:03.197
And so then the people who were

10:08.290 --> 10:11.476
We became very good friends.

10:11.496 --> 10:14.701
I became a major proponent of the main library.

10:14.721 --> 10:24.038
I gave a talk, which is also in here, to the Friends of the Public Library about why we needed it and particularly about the kind of building that it should be.

10:25.537 --> 10:30.727
So we were all in love with each other, and I went to parties that they gave.

10:30.927 --> 10:33.853
Was Kevin Starr in place at this point?

10:33.873 --> 10:35.116
Oh, no, he was long gone.

10:35.136 --> 10:38.181
He was good, because he was not fair.

10:38.482 --> 10:39.163
That's right.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.588
But I had no contact with Kevin Starr.

10:42.007 --> 10:45.711
I was sort of doing this on my own and then with them.

10:46.552 --> 10:57.303
So I wrote, at Marjorie Stern's suggestion, I wrote another column in 1987, just before the election, about how we needed the new main library and why.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.346
And so the bond measure passed.

11:00.406 --> 11:02.789
We had a big celebration that night.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.652
Pacific Heights Mansion, lots of wine.

11:08.197 --> 11:10.040
And then I thought it was sort of taken care of.

11:10.060 --> 11:19.773
Now, I've got to say that I have no reservations because Marjorie had said to me at some time, if only we could get Barton Gregorian to the library.

11:20.354 --> 11:22.257
Of course, lots of luck.

11:22.277 --> 11:26.843
Yeah, I mean, you know.

11:27.845 --> 11:28.526
I didn't use Barton for this book.

11:28.546 --> 11:28.746
Oh, great.

11:28.886 --> 11:29.026
Okay.

11:29.046 --> 11:29.387
That's wonderful.

11:29.467 --> 11:32.331
Well, just before you were leaving Brown to go to New York for it.

11:33.475 --> 11:47.518
He's now heading up for Carnegie.

11:47.538 --> 11:48.500
Did you know that?

11:48.520 --> 11:48.580
No.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.182
He left Brown University to name the new head of the Carnegie Corporation.

11:50.202 --> 11:50.883
Carnegie builds all the libraries.

11:50.903 --> 11:51.444
You'll be happy about that.

11:51.464 --> 11:52.246
It's a new challenge.

11:52.266 --> 11:53.728
I mean, I couldn't help make the connection between the comparison

11:55.463 --> 12:01.498
of Gregorian stature, who was a true scholar, a book lover and everything, with this man whom I met.

12:01.719 --> 12:08.055
Then they brought in Ken Dowland, because Dowland was so clearly,

12:11.258 --> 12:13.260
It was clear that he was illiterate.

12:14.421 --> 12:17.083
What makes that clear?

12:17.464 --> 12:21.027
When you talk to him, he hadn't read books.

12:21.047 --> 12:29.695
They had a junket, I believe, and a few others, Marjorie Stern.

12:29.755 --> 12:40.405
They went to Europe to look at new libraries with Fried, the architect.

12:40.385 --> 13:02.939
Kathy Simon, Dowling, and one of the people who was on that junket said on the way back, she sort of jokingly said to me, do you know what he was reading?

13:02.959 --> 13:03.259
And I said, no.

13:03.279 --> 13:04.100
He said, read his digest and then he was.

13:04.120 --> 13:04.621
Yes, that's what he read.

13:04.641 --> 13:05.743
And his office, from what I hear, had not a book in it.

13:05.763 --> 13:06.784
There was just a very spare space with two laptops.

13:06.804 --> 13:07.706
Well, it's ready to go in his house tonight.

13:07.726 --> 13:08.387
I'm going to ask him his library.

13:08.407 --> 13:08.507
Good.

13:08.527 --> 13:08.807
Good idea.

13:08.827 --> 13:09.328
Yeah, absolutely.

13:09.308 --> 13:18.903
Because he went into a, somebody I know's class, and he said, oh, you've got too many books here.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.429
You know, he sort of made a disparaging remark about the books.

13:22.449 --> 13:25.354
So it was very clear that this man, he was a technologist.

13:25.374 --> 13:27.437
Well, he just, you know, he was not a book person.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.200
So I had a misgivings about this guy.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.565
But clearly he was brought on to, who got him?

13:32.933 --> 13:40.904
Marjorie Stern, I believe, had a lot to do with it, but I'm sure Steve Coulter had a major will.

13:41.044 --> 13:43.668
But Coulter wasn't in place.

13:43.748 --> 13:46.031
Coulter was Library Commissioner and wasn't in background.

13:46.051 --> 13:52.199
He left for a while under the Jordan administration.

13:52.219 --> 13:56.866
That Library Commissioner was thrown out and another one came in and then Brown brought him back.

13:56.886 --> 13:59.329
Yeah, because Coulter was wine and dining at this time.

14:00.524 --> 14:10.652
I would double check on that.

14:11.543 --> 14:12.304
Sure.

14:12.324 --> 14:12.605
Absolutely.

14:12.705 --> 14:18.473
But I think that how did you come to the San Francisco club?

14:18.493 --> 14:18.834
Yeah.

14:18.934 --> 14:23.361
Because I'd sure like, you know, I mean, this man was so clearly not a book person.

14:23.381 --> 14:26.385
But I never had any idea that he would do what he did.

14:26.445 --> 14:30.511
I didn't realize that he would actually have a vendetta against books.

14:30.772 --> 14:31.833
Are you convinced that he does?

14:31.933 --> 14:33.095
I believe he does, yeah.

14:33.115 --> 14:41.027
I mean, I think that I've now run into enough of these technoids to realize that they really do

14:41.007 --> 14:48.586
believe that the book is a thing of the past, that it is an anachronism, an obsolete form of technology.

14:48.606 --> 14:54.460
When you talk of Darwin, you see he is imbued with this sense of mission.

14:55.874 --> 14:58.798
which probably is sincere, actually.

14:58.878 --> 15:02.744
He believes that he sees the future and he's going to take us there.

15:02.764 --> 15:06.049
Do you see the future, Mr. Bell?

15:06.169 --> 15:07.992
Do you believe he's in the future?

15:08.012 --> 15:09.074
Okay, I'm sorry.

15:09.094 --> 15:11.958
I'm formulating an interview while I'm talking.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.283
You imagine that, particularly after watching his resignation speech,

15:17.272 --> 15:33.354
The constant repetition of vision and visionary by Tim Dowling and by those people who supported him, like Art Agnes, for example, is that old line, if you repeat a lie long enough, people will come to believe it.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.858
This man is so clearly not a visionary.

15:36.878 --> 15:40.984
I mean, he's so lacking in charisma or anything.

15:41.572 --> 15:46.331
How can you actually convince people that you are a fear?

15:46.411 --> 15:49.945
Well, I think that we've always, every culture has a need for suit sales.

15:50.549 --> 15:54.675
And so he fills that world, and that he's a techno-zeller.

15:54.835 --> 15:58.680
And unfortunately, that's what's largely taking over in the world of librarianship.

15:58.700 --> 16:03.807
I mean, that's what's happening in the schools of librarianship everywhere, and that's what's so frightening about it.

16:03.827 --> 16:08.574
Anyway, to get back to it, so what happened then?

16:08.934 --> 16:09.916
Oh, yeah.

16:10.576 --> 16:11.918
The library was going up.

16:12.379 --> 16:19.729
As it went up, as the skin went up, I was more and more dismayed, because the outside, I think, is so appallingly bad.

16:19.709 --> 16:24.336
It's really illiterate, Mozart classicism.

16:25.138 --> 16:26.760
What kind of classicism?

16:26.780 --> 16:29.244
Mozart, Mozart, yeah.

16:30.286 --> 16:32.630
It was just bad on the outside.

16:32.670 --> 16:37.077
And Diane Filippi said, she was obviously, when I talked to her,

16:37.462 --> 16:42.150
She was a little bit nervous about the outside, but she said, you'll love the inside.

16:42.230 --> 16:45.295
And this is Diane Filippi, who is.

16:45.315 --> 16:49.862
Diane Filippi was president of the Friends of the Public Library.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.969
She was a very good friend of mine.

16:53.989 --> 17:02.703
She also is, I believe, the business manager for Kathy Simon's firm.

17:02.723 --> 17:03.524
Is Kathy Simon easy to get on the phone?

17:03.544 --> 17:04.566
I think so, yeah.

17:06.892 --> 17:22.128
If you look in the phone book, she might not be under Marjorie.

17:22.309 --> 17:29.657
Her husband's name was... What is it?

17:31.499 --> 17:34.642
Oh, I can't remember.

17:34.662 --> 17:35.002
S-T-E-L-E, right?

17:35.022 --> 17:35.683
No E. No E.

17:36.254 --> 17:47.871
Well, which street does she live on?

17:47.891 --> 17:51.997
She lives on, I believe it's Lombard Street.

17:52.017 --> 17:54.120
It might, unless she has that option not to use that.

17:54.140 --> 17:54.480
Carl, Carl Stern.

17:54.581 --> 17:56.203
C-A-R-L.

17:56.223 --> 17:57.705
I think she goes under that name.

17:59.255 --> 18:02.548
And Margie's a really interesting person.

18:02.608 --> 18:04.295
I really liked her a lot.

18:04.355 --> 18:05.781
I think I have to talk to her.

18:06.383 --> 18:06.805
Yeah.

18:06.825 --> 18:09.636
I mean, it would break my heart if I was in her position.

18:11.236 --> 18:24.052
And I'd like to talk to Kathy Simon.

18:24.072 --> 18:24.493
She did the interior.

18:24.513 --> 18:27.136
What the hell did she have in her life?

18:27.156 --> 18:28.478
Did she study libraries?

18:28.918 --> 18:29.899
Did she study libraries and services?

18:29.919 --> 18:30.480
Do you know what I'm saying?

18:30.500 --> 18:30.821
Just to ask her.

18:30.841 --> 18:31.962
I don't think that she did.

18:31.982 --> 18:32.523
She explained it from that.

18:32.543 --> 18:33.324
She and Anne Freed on the PQED tape.

18:33.344 --> 18:35.927
And it's just so intellectualized.

18:37.544 --> 18:49.761
with the building, and it was largely my friend Lyra Curlamba, the architect, who was sane all along as the planning process was going on.

18:49.781 --> 18:54.208
What's his name?

18:54.328 --> 18:54.768
K-U-R-L-A-M-D-R-B-E-R.

18:54.788 --> 18:55.429
Maybe he's going to be actually.

18:55.449 --> 18:55.890
I think you should.

19:02.317 --> 19:05.900
or critically, our colleagues were.

19:06.241 --> 19:12.646
But Ira was sort of, I think, a brave position.

19:12.666 --> 19:12.967
Probably.

19:12.987 --> 19:14.007
Oh, yes.

19:14.027 --> 19:14.168
Uh-huh.

19:14.188 --> 19:21.834
And he was, it almost broke up our friendship because I wanted the library so badly.

19:21.854 --> 19:25.338
But he kept saying, this library isn't going to work.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.261
It's a mess.

19:29.281 --> 19:29.421
Wow.

19:29.842 --> 19:30.482
Well, did she ever do anything?

19:30.642 --> 19:31.463
Oh, they hated him.

19:32.506 --> 19:33.951
because he was so outspoken.

19:34.493 --> 19:42.583
And finally there was a picture of the library in the San Francisco Independent.

19:42.952 --> 19:51.862
And I was giving a talk to about 600 people in Herbst Theatre around that time, just before they started construction.

19:52.603 --> 19:56.127
And somebody asked me from the audience, what do you think of the new main library?

19:56.147 --> 20:04.497
And I had to sort of pause, and then I said, well, I was all for it, but I'd just seen the picture, and it looks like a disaster.

20:04.597 --> 20:05.759
I'm really sorry.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.622
It's probably too late to change it.

20:08.602 --> 20:32.618
oh that was on saturday on monday morning at nine o'clock i had a call from cappy simon's firm saying that they had made changes on it and invited me down to see the model and i said you can't have made that many changes on it you know specifically was it was these aesthetic problems that you had or were they functional well it was mostly aesthetic i'd seen the outside but i'd also seen the plan and i was just sort of

20:34.015 --> 20:36.077
I was so confused by the plan.

20:36.197 --> 20:48.950
I was such a mess of every floor, different with this diagonal slashing through it, and it had no clarity to it, and so I had misgivings about that, too.

20:48.970 --> 20:51.793
Mostly it was aesthetics at that point.

20:51.813 --> 20:59.280
But, I mean, I never could imagine that they simply wouldn't plan for the capacity of the World Library, because that would be the content of being the plan.

21:09.537 --> 21:25.965
I said, with all due respect, when you lost that floor, why couldn't you have modified the space that was in age for shelves?

21:25.985 --> 21:26.706
I mean, you know, this is a library.

21:26.727 --> 21:27.949
Actually, it's a beautiful building, but where are the books?

21:27.969 --> 21:28.610
That's my reaction when I go in.

21:28.630 --> 21:29.311
Very pretty, but can't make quite.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.112
Remember that line from the dirty desk?

21:30.132 --> 21:30.533
Where are the books?

21:31.222 --> 21:51.257
So they took away a floor from the British Library, so they cut back in the auditorium.

21:51.278 --> 21:52.059
But they still made room for the books.

21:52.079 --> 21:52.239
Why not?

21:52.259 --> 21:54.383
And they said, well, we don't want it to be, we talked about walking in, we didn't want it to be lifeless.

21:54.403 --> 21:55.525
So we're talking about a monument to anything but books.

21:55.505 --> 22:01.133
What it's really about is about creating spaces that photograph well in the architectural magazines.

22:01.293 --> 22:04.437
It won prizes in architectural magazines.

22:04.517 --> 22:07.582
I think the AIA Journal.

22:07.622 --> 22:13.309
Basically, a building like that is to win prizes for the architectural firm so that they can build other ones.

22:13.329 --> 22:18.897
In fact, Simon's firm is now specializing in libraries.

22:20.142 --> 22:38.263
And I was meaning to write the AI journal to say, do you ever check out a building for its functionality?

22:38.284 --> 22:39.445
That is an important aspect of architecture after all.

22:39.465 --> 22:41.167
Captain Simon, do you know the name of the firm on the top of your head?

22:41.187 --> 22:41.567
It's Simon Markins.

22:41.587 --> 22:42.048
Simon Thomas Markins.

22:42.068 --> 22:42.468
Where's his name?

22:42.489 --> 22:42.569
Yes.

22:42.589 --> 22:43.009
Simon et cetera.

22:43.029 --> 22:43.149
Right.

22:43.169 --> 22:43.770
He looks like a lawyer's firm.

22:48.712 --> 22:49.553
I do.

22:49.573 --> 22:53.639
In fact, I've got to be over at the bank bus at 10-15.

22:53.659 --> 22:53.979
Oh, okay.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.683
Well, I'll just finish.

22:56.903 --> 22:57.604
I mean, I'll run.

22:57.624 --> 22:58.526
Wait, thanks a lot.

22:58.546 --> 23:01.850
Are you going to come right back?

23:01.870 --> 23:02.191
Yeah.

23:02.351 --> 23:03.873
Okay, I'll just wrap this up.

23:03.893 --> 23:07.318
I need a lot of stuff.

23:07.338 --> 23:12.164
So, what happened was in early 96, just before the library opened.

23:12.184 --> 23:18.533
Everybody was getting excited and anticipating this, and KQED Radio has a morning talk show

23:19.525 --> 23:29.698
And they asked me to come in with Ken Dallin and what's his name from Stanford?

23:29.718 --> 23:30.159
Mike Keller.

23:30.459 --> 23:35.546
And Nick Baker, who is so controversial, was going to call in from somewhere out there.

23:36.667 --> 23:40.272
And obviously, Nick and I were to represent the Luddite side.

23:40.913 --> 23:43.877
They were representing technological progress in the future.

23:44.938 --> 23:47.001
That was got to be a pretty nasty interview.

23:48.449 --> 23:49.210
Contentious.

23:49.570 --> 23:50.372
Contentious.

23:50.952 --> 23:55.418
You know, I wasn't really all that committed at that time.

23:55.438 --> 23:59.043
I hadn't seen the library, but I believe in books.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.166
And it was pretty clear these guys didn't believe in books.

24:01.186 --> 24:02.487
They believed in technology.

24:03.469 --> 24:10.358
At one point, I did say, they asked me what I thought about the library, and I said, for the outside, get literate.

24:10.378 --> 24:11.399
I haven't seen the inside.

24:11.419 --> 24:12.501
I'm hoping better for that.

24:12.561 --> 24:15.925
And Gowen looked at me with contempt and said,

24:16.765 --> 24:19.826
You just say that because you're ignorant.

24:20.270 --> 24:21.780
He called me ignorant and I thought

24:22.773 --> 24:24.094
Insecure as I may be.

24:24.114 --> 24:28.639
I've been told a lot of things, but when it comes to architecture, I'm not ignorant.

24:28.719 --> 24:30.220
You are an architecture critic, by the way.

24:30.481 --> 24:32.062
I was, yeah, at that time.

24:32.082 --> 24:35.706
I'm an environmental historian now.

24:35.726 --> 24:43.193
Without having to go through your ACs at this point, is this something you can send me a retail or something like that?

24:43.213 --> 24:43.354
Sure.

24:43.374 --> 24:46.977
You mentioned you have some books being published.

24:47.418 --> 24:49.119
I like that.

24:49.760 --> 24:49.860
Sure.

24:49.840 --> 25:09.771
But I don't need to do this right now.

25:09.791 --> 25:11.193
Are you going to be available at some point today or tomorrow evening?

25:11.213 --> 25:11.314
Sure.

25:11.334 --> 25:12.375
Coming back, he goes to Peter Howard at Serendipity.

25:12.395 --> 25:12.576
Oh, good.

25:12.596 --> 25:12.776
Oh, sure.

25:12.796 --> 25:13.377
Oh, that's a great bookstore.

25:13.397 --> 25:13.777
Oh, it's wonderful.

25:13.797 --> 25:14.539
Peter's one of the great booksellers.

25:14.559 --> 25:14.659
Yeah.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.981
I'm writing a chapter in European, a European bookseller scholar.

25:16.001 --> 25:17.383
People who understand books, research books, books are living things.

25:19.270 --> 25:24.118
You'll get completely lost in that place.

25:24.138 --> 25:29.065
And it's only the surface, because you've got warehouses behind it.

25:29.085 --> 25:29.867
I've written about Peter.

25:29.887 --> 25:30.688
Peter's my general name.

25:30.808 --> 25:31.349
Oh, okay.

25:31.369 --> 25:34.514
Anyway, so we were sort of the loggerheads on that.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.357
Nick, I didn't realize that.

25:36.377 --> 25:37.819
At some point he stopped.

25:37.799 --> 25:42.408
talking, and I didn't realize he'd gotten so angry he'd pulled the phone out of the wall.

25:43.030 --> 25:45.114
I wasn't that angry.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.717
I was being actually too polite.

25:47.299 --> 25:54.373
That was just a few weeks, I believe, before Nick and I gave this talk, and that was the first time I'd met Nick, so this is after the formal opening of

25:55.366 --> 26:00.492
I think the library was just coming out because I still hadn't been inside the library.

26:00.512 --> 26:01.273
It opened in April.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.197
The May talk was the month after the opening.

26:04.377 --> 26:04.577
Right.

26:04.597 --> 26:07.581
I think this was just shortly before the thing opened.

26:07.601 --> 26:08.802
Everything's in place.

26:08.822 --> 26:08.942
Yeah.

26:09.363 --> 26:13.207
Because I know people had already taken press tours through the library.

26:13.568 --> 26:15.690
I haven't seen it.

26:15.710 --> 26:19.976
I think probably the first time I was in the library was for the May 30th talk.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.058
No, I had actually been in there before.

26:22.118 --> 26:25.322
And again, I had some misgivings, but nothing like

26:26.399 --> 26:31.533
when I heard Nick talk and heard it explain what was happening.

26:31.794 --> 26:34.501
And my jaw was literally, it just fell.

26:34.561 --> 26:37.710
I just couldn't believe it, what he was saying.

26:39.335 --> 26:41.320
I don't think anybody in the audience could either.

26:42.025 --> 26:48.455
Do you have any copies of some of the pieces that you wrote?

26:48.676 --> 26:50.238
Oh, yeah, they're all here.

26:50.258 --> 26:50.839
I have them here.

26:50.859 --> 26:51.440
I brought them all.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.343
See, a journalist knows that.

26:53.423 --> 26:56.969
I did find the archive notes.

26:57.089 --> 26:59.853
Oh, yeah, let me just finish this.

26:59.994 --> 27:08.387
I was so angry at what Nick said, and talking with him afterwards, and the librarians who had told him about this stuff,

27:08.367 --> 27:15.117
But I wrote a letter to the editor, which was published in the Chronicle, and it basically slammed Dalton.

27:15.237 --> 27:24.330
It said, largely, compressed what Nick had said, that these books had been disclosed of because the new library was small and Dalton was to blame for it.

27:24.350 --> 27:27.354
Ben called me up that morning and said, you have not made Mr. Dalton's day.

27:28.075 --> 27:35.826
He wrote back a response to mine, which is a rather stupid letter, but it was in that letter that he said that this was not a research library.

27:36.042 --> 27:40.687
He lived to regret that, actually.

27:40.787 --> 27:43.469
Gina reiterated that yesterday.

27:43.710 --> 27:43.870
Did she?

27:43.890 --> 27:46.673
Well, it all depends on what you mean by a research library.

27:46.693 --> 27:47.574
It's not the bandwagon.

27:48.134 --> 27:48.495
Oh, you did?

27:48.515 --> 27:50.136
What did you do?

27:50.156 --> 27:50.316
Oh, wow.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.719
You used the San Francisco Public for research.

27:52.859 --> 27:55.161
That's an interesting disclosure for you, isn't it?

27:55.181 --> 27:55.642
Oh, very.

27:55.722 --> 28:00.026
I mean, because the San Francisco History Room is one of the first places I was headed for doing research.

28:00.046 --> 28:04.851
She said, other than San Francisco history and maybe gay, lesbian, you know, which is what they call it.

28:04.831 --> 28:23.751
And there are collection development offices of every major, you know,

28:24.355 --> 28:36.890
Okay, so that's when Dowland made that statement, and that has echoed down the years since then, because this is not what people voted for.

28:37.071 --> 28:48.945
You know, a $110 million bond issue, if they had been told that back then, I'm sure that bond issue would not have passed.

28:50.022 --> 28:58.451
The morning that that ran, I was in cold sweat because I thought I had gone out on a limb myself.

28:58.531 --> 29:00.993
I was taking Nick Baker's word for it.

29:01.013 --> 29:05.638
Then I had put this out in front of the Bay Area, in Northern California.

29:05.658 --> 29:06.879
I called up Nick.

29:06.999 --> 29:10.583
I said, Nick, I'm really worried that I've wronged Ken Dowland.

29:10.603 --> 29:13.766
He said, look, I thought the same thing myself.

29:13.846 --> 29:14.427
He said,

29:14.845 --> 29:16.207
I've checked everything out.

29:16.607 --> 29:18.209
It all worked well.

29:18.229 --> 29:21.293
You stated exactly what has happened.

29:21.313 --> 29:23.816
And in fact, that happened to be the case.

29:23.836 --> 29:42.718
As I got more and more into it, what was happening, I wrote a query to find out if this was happening at other libraries around the country through a listserv back in Amherst, Richard Slurk's listserv.

29:43.258 --> 29:44.700
He'd asked me to put it on.

29:45.170 --> 29:48.054
and explained a bit about what was happening at the San Francisco public.

29:48.435 --> 29:52.882
Within a couple of days, I had gone to the library of Listservs all over the world.

29:53.162 --> 29:55.566
I started getting clicks from all over the world.

29:55.586 --> 30:03.158
Again, I went into a cold sweat because I didn't know that the internet works that way, and the black-naked nuclear missiles, you can't pull it back when it's out there.

30:03.318 --> 30:07.304
But again, I felt that I had long down.

30:07.324 --> 30:09.608
I really, by putting this out there,

30:10.060 --> 30:14.428
But I just got an enormous number of things from people.

30:14.448 --> 30:18.075
It was a very interesting discussion about what's happening.

30:18.095 --> 30:19.197
Did you copy all this?

30:19.217 --> 30:20.078
Yeah, it's all in my archives.

30:20.559 --> 30:31.579
I've got the hit that came in from Colorado that said that this librarian experienced with Dowling as a teacher at the University of Colorado.

30:31.762 --> 30:37.413
It didn't take a Nostradamus to tell what happened when he got his hands on a major public library.

30:37.433 --> 30:38.355
Is this something you can give to me?

30:38.375 --> 30:39.878
Is this something you can get to me?

30:39.898 --> 30:42.383
Oh yeah, I forgot to bring it to you.

30:42.404 --> 30:43.967
But I can get you all that stuff.

30:43.987 --> 30:44.949
It's all in my archives.

30:45.149 --> 30:46.772
I'm going to run.

30:46.792 --> 30:50.460
Are you going to be around later today?

30:50.480 --> 30:50.580
Sure.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.803
Are you at your phone number?

30:52.685 --> 30:54.069
I'm going home right now.

30:54.570 --> 30:57.458
I've got to do this Berkeley stuff.

30:57.478 --> 30:59.684
This is totally apart from San Francisco.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.869
There's things going on over there, as you realize.

31:02.651 --> 31:04.075
Very interesting.

31:04.135 --> 31:05.258
I'd like to talk more about that.

31:05.278 --> 31:07.624
I would like to say, though, before we stop,

31:07.604 --> 31:15.053
I've been a real embarrassment for the library administration because they've attacked Nick.

31:15.093 --> 31:16.354
They've attacked Toby Singer.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.696
They never really attacked me.

31:18.236 --> 31:23.382
I think that's because I was so closely identified with getting the library built.

31:23.422 --> 31:31.612
Jim Haas, who has spared nothing to attack Nick Baker, once said that, you know, they should put my name over a door at least.

31:32.493 --> 31:35.036
Jim Haas, H-A-S.

31:35.056 --> 31:36.177
Haas is...

31:36.157 --> 31:42.447
a lawyer in San Francisco who has been behind the Civic Center restoration.

31:43.048 --> 31:52.724
He was one of the major figures in launching this preemptive strike against Nick Baker before his article came out in The New Yorker.

31:53.005 --> 31:57.472
They accused him of being an out of town or an opportunist and everything.

31:57.492 --> 32:00.477
I think very good about Jim Haas.

32:00.457 --> 32:10.495
Anyway, so I'm in this peculiar position because I was so closely identified with getting the building built and then turned against it.

32:10.515 --> 32:14.943
And Coulter, from what I've heard, Coulter feels that I am a traitor.

32:15.705 --> 32:17.227
Your name didn't come up at all.

32:17.408 --> 32:19.812
Well, I haven't been going to library commission meetings.

32:19.832 --> 32:23.599
I mean, even the name that he's torn up that I'm seeing, yours didn't come up.

32:23.619 --> 32:24.861
That's interesting, yeah.

32:25.448 --> 32:50.595
yeah um they don't really quite know how to deal with them because they have a great deal of respect for me and turning against them and being public about it is the last thing that they expected so i know you are you californian yeah i'm a san francisco historian so they can't accuse you of you

32:52.027 --> 32:54.716
No, I'm spared that.

32:54.897 --> 33:02.543
You know, he's coming in from, you know, central Massachusetts, you know, trying to make a name for himself.

33:03.687 --> 33:12.742
It's part of the provincialism of San Francisco, which likes to claim itself to be a sophisticated world-class city, but in fact, it's often just shockingly provincial.

33:12.982 --> 33:15.186
It could be like a country club here.

33:16.027 --> 33:20.214
When they want to pull up the job ridges, they can't.

33:20.234 --> 33:21.075
It's stupid.

33:21.095 --> 33:23.119
Do you have to continue?

33:23.239 --> 33:23.339
Sure.

33:23.359 --> 33:24.040
Just give me a call.

33:24.060 --> 33:25.122
I've got to go.
