WEBVTT

00:06.629 --> 00:12.798
Yeah.

00:13.799 --> 00:23.172
A lot of it is middle-aged guys who have displaced their sort of Don Juan-ism into books.

00:23.252 --> 00:24.794
You know, it's the passionate search.

00:24.854 --> 00:32.465
The moment you get it, you're through with it, you're off to the other book.

00:34.328 --> 00:35.669
I'd like a Diet Coke.

00:35.689 --> 00:36.130
Sure.

00:36.262 --> 00:37.744
Do you have iced tea?

00:37.764 --> 00:39.886
We don't brew our own in South Arizona.

00:39.906 --> 00:40.467
I'll have a day, cool.

00:41.268 --> 00:41.649
All righty.

00:41.929 --> 00:43.371
Do you want to hear what we're featuring today?

00:44.853 --> 00:45.493
I'm sorry?

00:45.573 --> 00:46.034
Okay, sure.

00:46.074 --> 00:48.177
Do you want to hear what we're featuring today?

00:48.257 --> 00:49.358
We have homemade lasagnas.

00:49.638 --> 01:00.952
Anyway, there is a kind of male competitive sort of chasing books instead of chasing women thing.

01:02.194 --> 01:03.195
I go to a book auction.

01:03.235 --> 01:04.817
I really feel it.

01:04.865 --> 01:26.586
But I think it's also a kind of world over which you have some control, and I think when people feel out of control, to have that world, whether it's toy soldiers or books or whatever it is,

01:27.427 --> 01:28.929
There's something comforting.

01:29.049 --> 01:29.830
Oh, good.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.711
We still have some.

01:31.772 --> 01:33.393
Vegetable or hosta?

01:33.453 --> 01:37.718
Our vegetables today are sauteed zucchini, summer squash, and tomatoes.

01:38.439 --> 01:38.719
Hosta?

01:39.359 --> 01:40.901
What was the vegetable again?

01:41.021 --> 01:45.366
It's zucchini, summer squash, and tomato.

01:45.766 --> 01:51.692
I started collecting beginning in high school.

01:52.633 --> 01:56.117
I used to, as I was telling you, buy

01:56.587 --> 01:59.611
I didn't do it that often, but a couple of times.

01:59.651 --> 02:06.279
I remember one of the books was William Sewell's History of the Quakers, early 18th century folio.

02:07.260 --> 02:21.278
I'd buy these battered books, and I was a very sick kid with a lot of surgery, even through high school, and having very painful procedures.

02:22.523 --> 02:28.329
And I was worried about dying.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.612
And I saw these books that had survived a couple hundred years.

02:31.832 --> 02:37.858
And I said, gee, you know, somehow... It's so sad to be worried about dying as it's a young age, isn't it?

02:37.878 --> 02:38.699
Yeah, but I was.

02:38.919 --> 02:43.864
And in fact, even as I just said it, I kind of welled up.

02:44.684 --> 02:46.326
Very powerful moment in my past.

02:47.627 --> 02:50.590
And so there was something comforting.

02:50.705 --> 03:05.325
in buying old books, that they had survived, and also that I could sort of play doctor, reverse the roles, that they were my patients, and I was going to take care of them in the way that I'm taking care of all these books.

03:05.505 --> 03:07.008
And this is starting at about what age?

03:07.028 --> 03:08.450
17, 16, 17.

03:10.132 --> 03:12.115
Were you a readerly kid?

03:12.435 --> 03:13.977
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:14.017 --> 03:15.980
I was sort of a phenom kid.

03:16.621 --> 03:18.163
In fact, I was...

03:18.734 --> 03:19.835
Is it bothering you?

03:19.875 --> 03:21.416
No, no.

03:21.436 --> 03:22.117
Is it bothering you?

03:22.137 --> 03:23.919
No, it's not bothering me, but it has snakes in your face.

03:24.419 --> 03:29.384
Yeah, I was working for Look Magazine when I was 14.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.647
Come on.

03:32.787 --> 03:32.887
Yeah.

03:34.048 --> 03:40.154
I had been accepted to be a contestant on the 64,000-year-old question when I was eight in astronomy.

03:41.355 --> 03:41.635
Really?

03:41.715 --> 03:42.556
Yeah.

03:42.576 --> 03:47.020
I lived a couple blocks from the Hayden Planetarium, you know, across...

03:47.793 --> 03:53.480
away from New York Historical Society where I used to hang out a lot.

03:53.500 --> 03:59.348
And I was particularly ill when I was eight or nine.

03:59.368 --> 04:00.910
Is this anything that you want to tell me about?

04:00.950 --> 04:01.851
No, I don't.

04:02.813 --> 04:07.078
And my way of dealing with it was kind of controlling the stars.

04:07.759 --> 04:10.503
You know, if I could name the stars, I had some sense of the heavens.

04:10.743 --> 04:13.547
And it's like this astrology thing that I was telling you about.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.269
In fact, I didn't make that connection.

04:15.309 --> 04:17.732
I think the book is significant to me because

04:17.982 --> 04:20.468
this early astronomy thing.

04:20.488 --> 04:23.475
So I hung out with all these guys.

04:23.615 --> 04:28.908
They sort of adopted me at the Hayden Planetarium.

04:29.088 --> 04:34.962
Which I went to as a child, but it's going to be probably ten years before you're going.

04:35.060 --> 04:38.743
I was born in 49, now this is 57.

04:38.763 --> 04:43.367
You know, this is Sputnik, and they're trying to get young kids interested in astronomy.

04:44.248 --> 04:57.420
So I was this phenom in astronomy, and I took all these tests, and the scandal broke about six months before I was scheduled to go on it.

04:57.520 --> 05:01.524
I was nine months away from going on it.

05:02.184 --> 05:02.805
No kidding.

05:02.937 --> 05:04.319
At, you know, I'd be nine.

05:04.379 --> 05:07.122
And you'd have won, too, because you'd have been perfect for them.

05:07.663 --> 05:08.764
Well, yeah, it's fixed.

05:09.145 --> 05:10.406
Well, no, but I was the Jew.

05:10.426 --> 05:14.972
Remember, the Jew always uses to the Gentile at the end.

05:15.112 --> 05:17.175
Did you see the movie?

05:17.215 --> 05:17.595
Yeah.

05:17.615 --> 05:18.597
Yeah, yeah.

05:18.757 --> 05:19.398
But a kid, though.

05:19.598 --> 05:21.520
A kid is going to be the wild card, though.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.962
A kid might be the wild card, yeah.

05:23.863 --> 05:30.852
Of course, astronomy, real astronomy, serious astronomy is 99% math.

05:31.878 --> 05:40.009
I knew it more than any eight-year-old kid.

05:44.175 --> 05:58.375
I always feel moved by old books, and I see them as, as I say, kind of bodies that have suffered and that need some attention and care, and it's a displaced version of my own body.

05:59.030 --> 06:04.557
You must have started reading at a very early age.

06:04.657 --> 06:08.562
If you're eight years old, you're going to go on the $64,000 question.

06:08.982 --> 06:14.849
How did this come about?

06:15.710 --> 06:19.435
Partly it was the historical moment of Sputnik.

06:19.735 --> 06:25.081
How did they come along that you got the invitation to the $64,000?

06:25.101 --> 06:27.784
Oh, oh, well, it's almost embarrassing.

06:27.824 --> 06:29.987
My parents were at a cocktail party with the MC.

06:30.667 --> 06:31.388
Hal March.

06:31.408 --> 06:32.189
Yeah, Hal March.

06:32.549 --> 06:36.994
They were bragging, we have this kid who knows more astronomy than any kid in America.

06:38.336 --> 06:41.259
And he's sort of been taught it orally.

06:41.660 --> 06:48.207
You know, I was sort of helping him set up the Zeiss machine, remember, the big thing.

06:48.457 --> 06:49.858
I read all this stuff.

06:49.878 --> 06:57.865
In 56 and 57, there was this ton of astronomy published to create, get young kids like you into.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.789
And I was the number one boy.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.193
I was the guy they were writing for.

07:08.054 --> 07:08.755
Isn't that great?

07:10.437 --> 07:13.539
So March followed up and you talked to someone?

07:13.559 --> 07:17.603
Well, no, I had three sets of exams.

07:18.005 --> 07:18.906
No, they were serious.

07:18.926 --> 07:19.727
They tested you.

07:20.548 --> 07:23.492
And I was tested against college freshman textbooks.

07:23.532 --> 07:27.798
They were taking questions out of college freshman textbooks, which I could answer.

07:28.919 --> 07:30.962
Did you answer them like that?

07:31.783 --> 07:32.564
I was pretty good.

07:33.084 --> 07:37.490
And then they had to believe it.

07:38.131 --> 07:39.973
It didn't get lucky the first time.

07:39.993 --> 07:40.514
It came down.

07:40.554 --> 07:43.358
Somebody else gave me another version of the test.

07:44.799 --> 07:47.623
And, yeah...

07:48.160 --> 07:53.730
I had this career as a journalist when I was young, in high school.

07:54.030 --> 07:56.474
Where did you go to high school?

07:56.494 --> 07:58.718
I went to a little school in Manhattan, Birchwater.

08:00.181 --> 08:08.555
Because I had all this energy that almost, I mean, extraordinary energy released by my anxieties about dying.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.362
Just had to live, you know, absolutely to the fullest.

08:13.608 --> 08:18.155
So when I was 13, I got a job as an office boy at Look Magazine.

08:18.736 --> 08:20.178
And then I sort of worked up.

08:20.198 --> 08:21.480
I did a little writing for them.

08:22.741 --> 08:35.580
And I ultimately, when I was 17, got a job as a reporter on the London Daily Telegraph, where I covered the Mick Jagger drug trial, among other things, in the summer of 67.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.343
That's amazing.

08:37.363 --> 08:38.525
Yeah.

08:39.266 --> 08:42.130
And I published articles in the Sunday Supplement.

08:42.447 --> 08:43.168
Bylined?

08:43.669 --> 08:44.750
Bylined, of course.

08:44.831 --> 08:46.834
I still have them.

08:49.357 --> 08:52.141
Including one that I thought was pretty damn good.

08:53.443 --> 08:57.269
In those days, there were no rock channels, just BBC One, BBC Two.

08:57.389 --> 08:58.671
BBC Two played a little.

08:59.192 --> 09:04.520
So there were these pirate stations that broadcast from the channel, rock and roll.

09:05.301 --> 09:10.569
And they had a sort of underground school to train disc jockeys for pirate radio stations.

09:10.609 --> 09:11.290
And I...

09:12.383 --> 09:16.369
entered and kind of infiltrated and wrote this story about it.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.092
It was very popular.

09:18.112 --> 09:21.617
The London Times had a magazine supplement.

09:21.718 --> 09:26.525
The Telegraph decided they had to imitate it, and they had just started it in the mid-60s.

09:28.128 --> 09:32.975
And this was, you know, young people were a hot thing in swinging London.

09:34.037 --> 09:36.340
I lived in Haight-Ashbury for the summer of 68.

09:36.441 --> 09:38.083
I was there at the same time.

09:38.203 --> 09:38.644
Yeah.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.088
I was in the 80s, but I lived on Ashbury Street.

09:41.108 --> 09:41.568
Oh, did you?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.350
I got out there in June of 68.

09:43.791 --> 09:49.658
I lived on the corner of Grove and Ashbury, yeah.

09:49.678 --> 09:56.025
So, yeah, I had this sort of heavy-duty career as a kid.

09:57.287 --> 10:03.674
And I kind of burnt out, but I was a wild man.

10:05.136 --> 10:07.078
For instance, I went to Wesleyan.

10:07.868 --> 10:13.516
I got married as a sophomore because I was living life large and fast.

10:14.277 --> 10:17.342
I married a woman who was older, just graduated Smith.

10:18.464 --> 10:19.325
I was from New York.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.769
She was from upstate.

10:21.829 --> 10:32.965
I wanted her to experience New York, so I decided I'd transfer to Columbia just for my junior year, and then I'd go back to Wesleyan to graduate.

10:33.265 --> 10:37.530
I go to their admissions office while I'm in New York, and I said, I'd like an application.

10:37.550 --> 10:42.115
I'd like to apply as a non-matriculating transfer student.

10:42.135 --> 10:44.217
They said, well, we don't take non-matriculating transfers.

10:44.237 --> 10:50.484
It's hard enough to get in as a transfer student, but if you transfer, you've got to transfer for two years.

10:50.965 --> 10:52.266
You can't come for a year in your life.

10:53.047 --> 10:55.029
And then she said, well, that's not our policy.

10:56.691 --> 10:58.032
We don't take non-matriculating transfers.

10:58.052 --> 11:00.115
It's not our policy to take one-year transfers.

11:00.715 --> 11:02.277
So I said, who makes policy?

11:03.590 --> 11:07.015
So she gave me the name of this dean and vice president.

11:07.035 --> 11:09.399
Yeah, oh yeah, that's annoying.

11:09.539 --> 11:11.702
And I made an appointment the same day to see this guy.

11:11.722 --> 11:13.885
I said, I'm the best English major at West Virginia.

11:14.046 --> 11:18.332
Circumstances obliged me to be in New York next year with my new wife.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.697
I want to be associated with the number one English department in the city.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.022
The guy admitted me while I was sitting there.

11:25.042 --> 11:26.264
He called the admissions office.

11:26.785 --> 11:31.572
So I had 00001 was my student number because...

11:31.619 --> 11:36.845
They had no previously matriculating graduates, non-matriculating graduates.

11:36.865 --> 11:38.708
So you went back and got your degree from Wesleyan?

11:39.389 --> 11:39.889
Well, yeah.

11:40.029 --> 11:46.697
How come you didn't want to stay at Columbia to finish up?

11:46.717 --> 11:48.480
Like Wesleyan.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.885
The beauty of Wesleyan was that there were no graduate students.

11:53.152 --> 12:03.886
So I was working at the Beinecke with English professors when I was a sophomore doing work the graduate student research assistants would do.

12:03.906 --> 12:11.355
I was reading Libby Custer's Convent Diary for a guy at the end of my freshman year.

12:12.096 --> 12:15.761
So it was a much better place for undergraduates.

12:15.781 --> 12:21.268
And of course, Columbia sort of closed down for part of that time.

12:21.586 --> 12:32.817
So, describe the books that you were getting as a kid, that you were repairing, and that these were almost... Well, yeah, I didn't do it often, but I remember several times buying it and being moved by books.

12:32.877 --> 12:38.061
I grew up in a neighborhood of Holocaust survivors.

12:38.101 --> 12:39.903
Oh, that's one thing.

12:39.983 --> 12:41.725
We're going to talk about the fourth century.

12:41.745 --> 12:43.787
That's right.

12:43.807 --> 12:49.332
But a lot of my parents' friends were Holocaust survivors.

12:50.392 --> 12:58.210
So here's this sick kid surrounded in both my neighborhood and by parents' friends who are Holocaust survivors.

12:58.892 --> 13:05.667
And I began to sort of think of myself in some way as not a Holocaust survivor, but as a survivor of my own sort.

13:05.950 --> 13:10.295
And then suddenly the books became also survivors.

13:10.315 --> 13:16.283
And the three sort of categories blended a little bit in my own mind.

13:17.204 --> 13:23.271
And part of the poignancy of the book as survivor was these people I knew who were survivors.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.254
And you said some of these were booksellers now?

13:25.274 --> 13:27.256
Well, yeah, who themselves were.

13:27.997 --> 13:34.665
Yeah, between, say, 10th and 13th Street, 9th and 13th Street on 4th Avenue.

13:35.346 --> 13:35.907
You know, I...

13:36.308 --> 13:47.469
This is from somebody who was a high school student, but they certainly seemed to be Jewish to me, and they took to me in a way that suggests that.

13:48.310 --> 13:57.507
Because the key thing with these guys, you know, they had this dusty little tiny place, but they all had attics somewhere where they warehoused their stock.

13:58.010 --> 14:09.228
And I spent many a Saturday afternoon sweet-talking some guy to get somebody to go with me up the four flights of stairs with this key to get in.

14:09.508 --> 14:11.110
Were you looking for anything in particular?

14:11.912 --> 14:17.901
Well, no, it was my version of entering the past, right?

14:18.362 --> 14:26.194
The past that the book talks about, the past of the bookseller, and my own, just somehow this...

14:26.478 --> 14:35.009
Just going into one of these places is an entry into the past.

14:35.029 --> 14:46.384
And going into one of these storerooms, I particularly felt that I spent a lot of time trying to get Argosy Bookstore to let me into their Brooklyn warehouse.

14:46.404 --> 14:52.452
And I finally set it up where they were going to let me go on a truck with some guy.

14:52.567 --> 14:59.198
But I had to promise I'd spend $200, and they'd let me go.

14:59.278 --> 15:02.002
Yeah, oh, and then the truck didn't show up.

15:02.082 --> 15:02.824
I never got there.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.869
But I always wanted to go that next step.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.673
What am I not seeing?

15:08.693 --> 15:09.875
You know, what's hidden?

15:09.895 --> 15:12.640
So at what point did the association copy?

15:13.581 --> 15:15.925
Well, that...

15:17.980 --> 15:33.678
I think when I began to be an English major and realized that, you know, I couldn't afford books from, say, Hawthorne's library, but I could afford books from Hawthorne's son's library.

15:34.559 --> 15:39.005
I could afford books from Melville's sister's library.

15:39.025 --> 15:45.372
So I began to sort of insinuate myself into the lives of these great writers.

15:46.398 --> 15:53.666
And then eventually I was able to, by way, just escape from being sick.

15:53.746 --> 16:03.297
So I was in a kid's ward where kids were dying, playing checkers with a guy, and the next day he wouldn't be there.

16:05.019 --> 16:06.380
And this was when I was five.

16:07.682 --> 16:15.831
So I early on was trying to create a space in another world where I was safe, in the world of books.

16:15.912 --> 16:17.054
And living for you.

16:17.094 --> 16:17.955
Part of that world.

16:19.277 --> 16:21.220
Living a lot?

16:22.061 --> 16:24.765
Yeah, that's fine.

16:24.985 --> 16:25.466
Okay.

16:26.207 --> 16:26.908
Enjoy.

16:27.148 --> 16:31.154
Everything you need then?

16:31.915 --> 16:32.236
Yeah.

16:32.416 --> 16:32.777
Okay.

16:33.317 --> 16:34.058
This is nice.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.764
Isn't it?

16:37.884 --> 16:38.124
Yeah.

16:38.465 --> 16:38.545
Sun.

16:38.913 --> 16:48.903
You said you need the emotional connection with a book, and we're talking about the OED, the electronic OED you're talking about.

16:49.023 --> 16:51.345
It's extraordinary, obviously, what you just described to me.

16:51.365 --> 16:52.687
It's unbelievable.

16:55.369 --> 16:58.913
But what you get is the text of the book.

16:58.953 --> 17:02.596
You don't get the physical object, and the physical object is something.

17:02.656 --> 17:06.220
It's this container for the spirit of the book,

17:06.622 --> 17:09.925
the living character of the book, and you can revisit it.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.226
You own it.

17:11.246 --> 17:11.847
It's there.

17:12.167 --> 17:12.748
You see it.

17:12.848 --> 17:15.610
For me, as I say, I go to my library, I feel comforted.

17:16.031 --> 17:16.972
I like to look at books.

17:18.153 --> 17:19.974
They're full of associations.

17:20.155 --> 17:24.579
When I read it, where I bought it, what it looked like, and then seeing it again.

17:24.619 --> 17:28.943
And that ongoing emotional relationship to the object.

17:29.403 --> 17:31.045
We're all defined by objects.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.507
Every home is a museum to ourselves.

17:33.942 --> 17:42.673
in which you could sort of read everything in it as a marker of one piece of one's life.

17:42.693 --> 17:47.138
And some of our most profound relationships are to objects.

17:47.158 --> 17:55.689
Like the examples I was giving a woman who for 40 years, this is my boon companion, my best friend, has taken me through the vicissitudes of life.

17:56.289 --> 17:58.612
You know, I can read it in bed at night, I can put my head on it.

17:59.513 --> 18:00.895
I can ask the...

18:01.600 --> 18:05.767
Eric Holzenberg, librarian at the Groyer Club.

18:05.787 --> 18:08.571
The librarian where, at Groyer?

18:08.591 --> 18:08.972
At the Groyer Club.

18:08.992 --> 18:09.132
Uh-huh.

18:09.152 --> 18:16.023
And a woman who's replaced Mark Fibonation at Cornell at the Rare Book Library, Catherine Reagan.

18:16.183 --> 18:18.647
So they're putting together a program for the ALA.

18:19.083 --> 18:22.886
in 2000 in Chicago.

18:23.046 --> 18:25.308
It's great because it's when I hope my new book comes out.

18:25.328 --> 18:26.790
So that really would be terrific.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.611
That's something in the right corner.

18:28.631 --> 18:29.172
Me too?

18:29.592 --> 18:29.692
Yeah.

18:29.712 --> 18:31.774
You got it.

18:31.954 --> 18:34.636
Thank you very much.

18:35.317 --> 18:35.457
Thanks.

18:35.958 --> 18:36.198
Yeah.

18:36.278 --> 18:42.323
And the theme of this program is the museum of the book.

18:42.704 --> 18:47.908
Are all libraries, in a sense, are we approaching that day where every library in

18:48.766 --> 18:53.573
will be considered a museum and every book will be an object.

18:53.593 --> 18:54.975
And what do you think about that?

18:56.297 --> 18:58.460
No, I can't see it.

18:59.342 --> 19:01.325
Reading is a very emotional act.

19:02.006 --> 19:02.727
But it's physical?

19:02.807 --> 19:04.750
There's a physicality to it?

19:05.291 --> 19:07.474
Beyond physicality, there's an intimacy.

19:07.834 --> 19:10.719
You're holding this object close to you with both hands.

19:11.740 --> 19:14.284
I know when I'm reading, I'm usually lying down.

19:15.074 --> 19:17.337
It's a very private act.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.559
Something's going on.

19:18.739 --> 19:26.651
See, the problem with machine-readable stuff is it's all based on an information transfer model.

19:27.392 --> 19:29.575
Reading is not about information transfer.

19:29.695 --> 19:32.839
It's about an emotional engagement with language.

19:34.422 --> 19:38.548
And you need to be in a sort of protected setting.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.672
You need to be comfortable because...

19:42.074 --> 19:43.676
You're opening your mind to things.

19:43.716 --> 19:47.019
You're thinking through issues in your own life, through the book.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.184
And once you've read it, you want to keep it, because it's now part of who you are.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.107
Keeping it is the key word, by the way.

19:55.127 --> 19:55.287
Yeah.

19:55.547 --> 20:00.472
Well, the experience... When you're done, we're going to go to... I'll mention something to your book.

20:00.492 --> 20:00.792
Go ahead.

20:01.113 --> 20:01.813
You got it.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.435
Because it's a relationship.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.096
It's started.

20:04.276 --> 20:05.437
There can be re-readings.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.860
There can be just the pleasure of knowing you have it.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.562
The pleasure of having it there.

20:10.660 --> 20:13.507
What it suggests about you to yourself.

20:14.690 --> 20:22.349
You know, I have students who say, I'll teach them something like Absalom, Absalom.

20:22.369 --> 20:23.151
Difficult book.

20:23.620 --> 20:29.966
the sense of triumph and mastery of completing it and understanding it to some degree is so enormous.

20:30.006 --> 20:33.990
They want that book on their shelf for the rest of their lives.

20:34.671 --> 20:36.752
I was thinking of my British Shakespeare.

20:36.773 --> 20:43.018
Yeah, you know, you said... I go on it to a girl and she never gave it back and how for 25 years I've been trying to... Yeah, exactly.

20:43.038 --> 20:43.559
And I still have it.

20:43.579 --> 20:47.343
Because you had an intimate relationship.

20:47.383 --> 20:49.184
You had an intimate relationship.

20:49.204 --> 20:52.007
And that intimacy is completely impossible.

20:52.274 --> 20:55.037
is destroyed and impossible to achieve.

20:56.700 --> 21:01.185
And it's like sleeping with somebody who disappears the minute you're done.

21:04.850 --> 21:07.553
You've got to have something, some token of its presence.

21:07.854 --> 21:09.896
Go ahead.

21:09.916 --> 21:13.861
Yeah, it's very powerful to... So I'm going to start a chapter.

21:13.881 --> 21:17.266
I think start a chapter.

21:17.366 --> 21:19.969
I'm going into... I like scenes and I like...

21:20.219 --> 21:21.320
I like narrative.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.842
I like stories.

21:23.182 --> 21:33.354
So what's your reaction to that?

21:33.974 --> 21:37.698
To this electronic book?

21:37.738 --> 21:46.688
That is not like the ones that are being marketed now where they just give you text and something that's like a little computer, a palm thing.

21:46.708 --> 21:49.011
This is actually a book that will have 300

21:50.223 --> 22:14.577
computer screens with the texture of a page and you'll be able to load a book on there when you're done you'll be able to load another book is that there is a physicality to it but it's not permanent is it i don't know it's not permanent it's not it's so completely mediated that it doesn't have the power of the physical presence of a book i collect old books i like

22:15.012 --> 22:20.878
For me, I like to see the thumbprint where somebody has turned the page over and over again.

22:20.898 --> 22:22.299
There's some pattern of wear.

22:22.379 --> 22:32.789
There have been people here before, and I'm now joining the company of previous readers of this particular copy of a book.

22:35.431 --> 22:44.800
It's like if I go into an art lecture, you see these slides, and they make every picture, every painting, look the same size.

22:45.100 --> 22:49.526
You can have a painting this big and a painting this big, but the slides are all the same.

22:50.928 --> 22:52.130
And the same thing here.

22:52.210 --> 23:00.141
You lose the specificity of how this book was housed.

23:00.681 --> 23:13.639
You can't, to separate the text from the book, to separate the artifact from the meaning, does real violence to the fact that the meaning has...

23:13.990 --> 23:18.255
proceeds out of the artifact in some ways.

23:19.056 --> 23:33.133
Again, as I was saying about that monumental folio, as opposed to this will do a decimal of sermons, that folio is making a cultural statement, a very powerful sort.

23:33.153 --> 23:36.977
This is the orthodoxy, this is here, and this will last.

23:37.430 --> 23:39.574
It's the pillar of your church.

23:39.654 --> 23:42.198
Are you familiar with a book called Paratexts?

23:42.218 --> 23:42.378
No.

23:42.559 --> 23:43.040
Oh, you should.

23:43.220 --> 23:46.345
If you have a fax or something, I'll fax it.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.749
Ken Carpenter at Harvard.

23:48.849 --> 23:51.474
He's the guy at the Widener Library.

23:51.654 --> 23:54.018
He decides which book.

23:54.158 --> 24:00.349
You know, for bibliographers, the book, it's important the moment it came out.

24:01.257 --> 24:06.384
But, you know, books have long, long lives.

24:06.804 --> 24:09.728
Like some of these books are in the same family for 300 years.

24:09.768 --> 24:11.570
Books do survive, don't they?

24:11.590 --> 24:12.451
Yeah, they survive.

24:12.471 --> 24:14.654
The book you showed me in the Frederick Douglass.

24:14.674 --> 24:14.975
Yeah.

24:15.696 --> 24:18.059
We don't know where that was for 80 or so years.

24:18.139 --> 24:18.719
Is that right?

24:18.759 --> 24:19.320
How many years?

24:19.360 --> 24:21.964
Not 80, but however many years it was.

24:22.024 --> 24:22.805
You can't tell me.

24:23.546 --> 24:27.611
It's got one of the best provenances I've ever seen initially.

24:27.651 --> 24:27.771
Yeah.

24:28.443 --> 24:32.328
But then, somehow it shows up in Paris.

24:32.949 --> 24:36.413
How it got to Paris from England, we don't know.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.396
But it survived.

24:39.217 --> 24:39.818
It survived.

24:39.898 --> 24:51.613
And you know, most books say prior, leaving aside Douglass, but earlier books, there are different compositors who have different spelling forms.

24:51.993 --> 24:57.100
You know, you look at a Shakespeare first folio, there's been recent work done on

24:58.295 --> 25:07.970
Well, not just the collation, but inferring the existence of a certain number of collators.

25:08.010 --> 25:16.303
When you have an unstable spelling, as was the case in Elizabethan England, you don't look it up in the dictionary.

25:17.853 --> 25:23.000
There were compositors who had their own spellings and normalized to them.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.322
They'd always use it this way.

25:24.382 --> 25:28.168
So the same word might appear four or five different ways.

25:28.408 --> 25:30.311
And it's not just the accident.

25:31.132 --> 25:34.036
It's the fact that there are different compositors.

25:35.058 --> 25:37.802
The book is a collaborative object.

25:37.882 --> 25:42.088
It's made by machines and by people and out of real products.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.092
And...

25:45.815 --> 25:52.245
that collaborative text or that collaborative artifact is lost.

25:52.565 --> 26:00.257
And if we were talking, imagine to have a relationship, let's say, with a woman, you could never touch it.

26:04.263 --> 26:08.770
What it means to take touch out of the equation is enormous.

26:10.973 --> 26:15.079
We're humanized by touch.

26:15.700 --> 26:20.264
We sort of bring things to life by touching them and being touched by them.

26:21.926 --> 26:26.710
So you think there is definitely something innate?

26:26.750 --> 26:37.120
There's an absolute physical need to hold, to touch, to be intimate with, to learn from, to make yourself vulnerable and receptive.

26:37.720 --> 26:42.585
When you're reading, you've put yourself in an incredibly vulnerable position of being

26:43.105 --> 26:45.148
sort of utterly receptive.

26:46.730 --> 26:55.541
And you've given a gift to the book to present yourself in a manner that allows it to make a difference and touch you in deep places.

26:56.783 --> 27:09.619
And that's an experience that requires the prerequisite of a certain sort of emotional setting and the terms of a physical intimacy.

27:10.021 --> 27:14.906
You remember we were talking about a possible title for this book, and I've played with about six of them now.

27:16.007 --> 27:20.212
There was one I liked, Archibald McLeish.

27:20.232 --> 27:22.234
It's related to the word textile.

27:22.895 --> 27:25.738
They both have to do with... Text is related to textile?

27:25.758 --> 27:27.079
They come from the same term.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.302
It's the wolf in war.

27:29.322 --> 27:34.327
When you're talking about spinning of yarn, you're talking about textile and you're talking about a text.

27:35.528 --> 27:36.389
Interesting.

27:36.890 --> 27:39.032
And... Or...

27:39.704 --> 27:54.768
spinning a yarn or... There are a number of textile things, but it's something that is put together in a way that creates a design.

27:57.433 --> 28:00.778
I'm just playing with the words text and textile.

28:01.459 --> 28:03.282
Account...

28:05.050 --> 28:18.551
Give me a second here to think about things.

28:18.651 --> 28:21.455
But it doesn't telegraph immediately.

28:21.475 --> 28:30.349
So you were thinking about text and texting.

28:30.599 --> 28:40.531
It's playing with something now.

28:40.551 --> 28:49.301
Well, you know, what I'm doing... But that's a kind of... I mean, in a sense, you're sort of doing that, too.

28:51.744 --> 28:57.771
What I'm really reading are... I'm reading writing in books.

28:58.747 --> 29:05.094
Not the book as writing, but writing, handwriting, whether it's annotations or signatures, writing in books.

29:06.836 --> 29:16.187
But reading readers, I kind of like that.

29:16.367 --> 29:22.474
I do, but I don't think it's my whole... It doesn't describe the wholeness of the project.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.737
It's an aspect of it.

29:25.240 --> 29:25.981
I'm going to.

29:26.822 --> 29:29.525
There's all those gerunds that sort of work both ways.

29:29.545 --> 29:41.078
It's the act of reading, and it's something you're witnessing, other people reading, and just what your investigation is.

29:41.098 --> 29:42.339
And of course, it's the house of work.

29:42.359 --> 29:43.500
You made a singular here.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.643
Well, I know, but... I like it.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.525
The singular works better.

29:47.945 --> 29:48.546
It does, it does.

29:48.586 --> 29:51.550
Because there are all sort of incarnations of one another.

29:52.370 --> 29:54.673
There's, you know, the ultimate house of work.

29:55.497 --> 29:57.888
Well, these are all versions of it.

29:57.908 --> 29:58.551
It's not bad.

29:58.953 --> 30:01.525
Oh, good.
