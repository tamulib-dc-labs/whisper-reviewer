00:03.288 --> 00:11.399
Well, if they care to an opportunity to say something, otherwise we're going to go right back to opening up to the questions from the floor.

00:11.419 --> 00:18.328
So Bob, Bill, or Alice, if either of you would like to say something now, please do.

00:18.368 --> 00:20.291
If not, we're going to just start with the question.

00:20.491 --> 00:25.077
I'd just like to say I was hearing some of the questions before about

00:25.327 --> 00:43.015
collections and the maturation, one of the sort of amplified statement I made on my comment earlier this morning is that many of the older collections are matured in the sense that they have most of the good material within that subject matter

00:42.995 --> 00:54.814
It's very much like in the art world of museums, where people think that they own museum-quality material, and therefore any museum of any quality should accept that material.

00:55.154 --> 01:01.724
Well, by definition, they have slacker space, and what you perceive as museum-quality material may not be.

01:01.744 --> 01:05.931
But there's hundreds of thousands of institutions in this country that do have it.

01:06.282 --> 01:13.842
And I think one of the problems that collectors have is a lack of information, a lack of knowledge about other places.

01:14.003 --> 01:22.485
I had to sort of force a personality to find out a lot about special collections and available venues in which to

01:22.769 --> 01:27.735
give material or provide access to this material.

01:27.835 --> 01:35.285
And so I don't think that many of the older established institutions necessarily communicate the message as to what they want.

01:36.126 --> 01:40.151
I said in my comments that you have to hone your own ideas of who you are.

01:40.171 --> 01:46.279
You have to define the whole piece of the special collection and then reach out and tell people who you are.

01:46.462 --> 01:51.913
I don't think the job is as well done as it should be among most institutions.

01:51.933 --> 02:02.314
Obviously, there are exceptions, but I think that's a fundamental flaw in today, particularly with digitization and all the changing.

02:02.334 --> 02:06.462
I said before, there's not many manuscripts for

02:06.948 --> 02:09.491
special collections in the 21st century.

02:09.511 --> 02:10.933
What are you going to do?

02:10.953 --> 02:16.199
Are you going to become just a collector of first editions with fine wrappers and be the West Coast dealers?

02:16.259 --> 02:19.864
And just deal with those kinds of books?

02:19.924 --> 02:23.809
You've got gold deals and unique materials.

02:23.889 --> 02:27.053
And so what type of unique materials appears earlier?

02:27.393 --> 02:29.195
What happens with the 21st century material?

02:29.215 --> 02:30.817
What are you going to do with that?

02:30.837 --> 02:32.179
So you've got to define yourself.

02:33.155 --> 02:38.041
Well, I have some comments on various things that were said in the last period.

02:38.061 --> 02:46.771
The first thing I wanted to say something about is the question of scarcity, since several people doubted my views on it.

02:47.251 --> 02:50.115
I don't doubt at all the material is going to keep turning up.

02:50.175 --> 02:54.400
If we take as a criteria that we're spending all the money we've got to buy stuff, I agree.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.825
I almost always had spent all the money I had to buy stock.

02:59.176 --> 03:00.358
But what am I getting?

03:01.259 --> 03:07.668
In 1984, I was pleased as punch, and I sold a beautiful set of Lewis and Clark for $7,500.

03:07.829 --> 03:09.010
Now it's a $125,000 book.

03:12.095 --> 03:16.321
The books that were once common have become uncommon or rare.

03:16.541 --> 03:17.843
I'm talking about in the world of rare books.

03:18.329 --> 03:31.073
And books that were once common in beautiful condition, where one could be very picky about the way the books work physically, are books where now one has to continually compromise on those issues.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.337
So we all make discoveries.

03:33.357 --> 03:38.046
I mean, that's what makes life exciting for all of us, is finding things.

03:38.466 --> 03:41.552
And there's still wonderful things to find, and there are wonderful things still out there.

03:41.937 --> 03:43.640
But the addicts have largely emptied out.

03:43.961 --> 03:52.316
And it's a feeling I constantly have, having been somebody who's fought both at the high end and trolling through the backwoods.

03:53.138 --> 03:54.480
But there's not as much out there.

03:54.500 --> 03:59.710
There are not as many trunks with Huckleberry Finn manuscripts out there as there used to be.

04:00.770 --> 04:05.074
But I do agree that the real change and real development is going to be in the opening of the new fields.

04:05.174 --> 04:12.341
And I think there still remain a lot of things that have yet to be capped.

04:12.361 --> 04:17.386
And I think that that's where the imagination and the persistence of the collector really comes to the fore.

04:17.867 --> 04:18.988
I'll give you one example.

04:19.008 --> 04:24.853
There have been several allusions here to the Yale's Book Collecting Prize, the Van Sindri Prize, which I've been a judge of for some time.

04:25.614 --> 04:29.578
And I have to say one of the most exciting collections that was ever entered in the prize

04:29.947 --> 04:37.975
was a collection of a kid who had spent his junior, summer between his junior and senior year in Poland in 1981 during the Solidarity Summer.

04:38.896 --> 04:49.367
And he performed a mini Thompson-esque exercise by filling two suitcases with every piece of ephemera, every poster, every broadside, every handout that came his way.

04:50.028 --> 04:53.051
And he hauled them back, we gave him the prize, and he gave the collection to Yale.

04:53.952 --> 04:59.498
And that was, that's a tremendous time capsule, an irreproducible time capsule.

04:59.663 --> 05:06.009
And in its own way, and that was a moment in history, but these things happen all the time.

05:06.149 --> 05:21.505
I think that there are a lot of areas, particularly in the ephemeral world, the world of real life, the world of popular culture, that remain to be explored and that are going to be of increasing interest as time goes by.

05:21.525 --> 05:26.970
Finally, I'd like to say that I agree very much with what Selby said about exhibitions.

05:27.490 --> 05:33.705
And it strikes me that as, I've been very interested in library exhibitions all through my career.

05:33.725 --> 05:44.149
I think that books can be presented in a way where they are exciting, where they engage people, where they interest people in books.

05:44.534 --> 05:54.530
I think it does help if your donor hasn't given you a requirement that they cannot be shown open, which does cut down the interest.

05:54.870 --> 06:01.060
But I think that recording those exhibitions is as important as putting them on.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.547
Having done a number, I know that if you've done an exhibition without a catalog, it doesn't exist.

06:05.982 --> 06:10.889
But if you do an exhibition with a catalog, it becomes a reference tool and a monument.

06:10.909 --> 06:20.703
And when we look at the libraries who made a practice of that, like the Lilly, that's produced a wonderful series of exhibition catalogs, we see what kind of function that can have, what kind of outreach that can have.

06:21.584 --> 06:27.572
Last night, John Cole and I were talking about the wonderful series of state catalogs that the Library of Congress did.

06:28.293 --> 06:29.475
And I still find those.

06:29.692 --> 06:32.476
wonderful resources and very sightable resources.

06:32.656 --> 06:38.864
They give a very good picture of the resources of the Library of Congress, but also are generally usable as reference.

06:39.005 --> 06:49.919
So I guess I would say to everybody who has the potential of putting on the exhibition, make sure you do a catalog, because if there's a way to spread the word, that's it.

06:49.939 --> 06:53.404
I just want to add one thing to what Bill said.

06:53.738 --> 06:57.086
I've been experiencing a great deal of frustration.

06:57.106 --> 07:03.803
I've been looking for a cataloger to catalog part of my collection for a lot of obvious reasons that were mortal.

07:04.404 --> 07:07.191
And I've had terrible problems finding catalogers

07:07.542 --> 07:15.897
that can catalog if they're willing to come to Cleveland or are living in Cleveland, there aren't any, will catalog a rare book collection.

07:16.177 --> 07:29.320
John Linsett, who lived in Cleveland, is a fine collector, had to send some music collection over to Europe to get the catalog because he couldn't find anyone in the United States in this area that was qualified.

07:29.340 --> 07:30.983
So that's another issue.

07:31.003 --> 07:31.744
You can talk about

07:31.724 --> 07:55.268
I guess I would also like to call our attention to one sort of group within our community that's been mentioned a couple of times today but really isn't represented in that guise, and that's the scholar or the faculty member.

07:55.619 --> 08:02.628
And a few of the comments that I'd like to make along those lines actually connect very nicely with Bill's remarks about exhibitions.

08:02.928 --> 08:07.213
First of all, the sort of academic as collector.

08:08.355 --> 08:19.028
I was saying to Jean Ashton earlier this morning that although Columbia's is one of the special collections that I really know best, it was conspicuously absent from my remarks.

08:19.801 --> 08:29.974
she was observing how many of their collections, and this is very true, of Chicago's as well, were formed by faculty members just buying books for their research.

08:29.994 --> 08:37.224
They would never call themselves bibliophiles, not that they see anything wrong with that term, they just didn't see themselves in that way.

08:37.304 --> 08:39.707
A lot of this was happening in those post-war years.

08:39.767 --> 08:47.918
They had Guggenheims or a year of research in Europe and books were cheap and there weren't scholarly reprints and they were just buying these books.

08:48.067 --> 08:51.892
they have become very important parts of many special collections.

08:52.753 --> 09:13.078
And although in some ways they have been the first ones perhaps to be eclipsed from the market or the collecting community because of what's happened in crisis, they also often represent the cutting edge of scholarship and the creative collecting that we've

09:13.210 --> 09:18.959
been talking about and to sort of connect that back to Bill's point about exhibitions.

09:19.299 --> 09:29.135
At Chicago, we very actively try to engage faculty and graduate students in doing our exhibitions.

09:29.155 --> 09:34.543
We feel that's a way to really get them into the collections, to get the subject expertise that we need.

09:34.726 --> 09:42.871
which amongst the curatorial staff, you know, it's just not always there in the areas we want to do collections about.

09:42.891 --> 09:49.090
And so earlier this fall, we had George Chauncey, a historian whose work

09:49.323 --> 10:00.521
Gay New York, some of you may be familiar with, do a sort of comparable show on the history of homosexuality, the relationship between research on homosexuality and the city of Chicago.

10:00.961 --> 10:04.667
We didn't call it Sex and the City, but we wanted to.

10:04.687 --> 10:12.900
And in the course of that exhibition, working on that exhibition with a graduate student of Georgia's, it became apparent that he had ties

10:13.353 --> 10:19.659
throughout the collecting community in an area that we were very interested in building our collections with.

10:19.759 --> 10:27.886
So again, those of us who work in academic institutions draw on our faculty because we want to know what they're working on.

10:27.906 --> 10:30.168
We want to know what areas we need to be building in.

10:30.268 --> 10:41.638
And they often have either the collections that they are building for their own work or the contacts with people who are generating these materials, fugitive travel collections.

10:41.855 --> 10:49.024
travel guides going back to the 50s and 60s that are just a remarkable resource.

10:49.244 --> 10:56.594
So again, faculty can also be another resource for collectors.

10:56.654 --> 10:59.157
A lot of what I think all of us try to do.

10:59.177 --> 11:03.002
We talked about the curatorial expertise and mentoring that goes on.

11:03.202 --> 11:06.967
or information sharing between collectors and libraries.

11:07.047 --> 11:18.043
But again, using our faculty in that conversation is something that can bring a collector into contact with someone who is so knowledgeable within our own worlds.

11:19.205 --> 11:29.800
I just want to follow up that a little further and say, one of the best series of exhibition catalogs in modern times has been prepared by scholars who are not bibliographers.

11:30.067 --> 11:42.251
is the John Carter Brown series that they've done on the relationship of different European countries with the development of the Americas, and those are a wonderful series for those of you who haven't seen it.

11:42.993 --> 11:50.067
Secondly, I would say that I think all of us should be innovative about trying to sneak books into other contexts, and here I think of

11:50.468 --> 12:06.790
one of the most wonderful shows, I think, of the last 10 or 15 years, the Seeds of Change show that the Smithsonian put on, which was about the migration of plants and things back and forth across the Atlantic, right from Columbus on.

12:07.531 --> 12:17.725
And that show had many books in it, in a very popular context, a very popular show, where the books really came alive in the context of artifacts

12:18.042 --> 12:33.618
and a show that at first glance might not have had anything to do with rare books, but did there.

12:33.758 --> 12:44.269
One of the things I observed today was that there was a theme that came through was that the dealers were having more success cultivating private collectors than the institutions.

12:44.755 --> 12:58.979
And during the afternoon session, Mary Lee was talking about the responsibilities that the librarians had and that maybe they didn't have enough time to be able to cultivate because of the institutional responsibilities they had.

12:59.620 --> 13:04.047
And then there's the layer of bureaucracy above

13:04.263 --> 13:16.415
which may be the development office, or maybe the institutional, the president has his own focus and own desire, which way, or who he wants to contact and how it can be done, and who is allowed to do that.

13:16.435 --> 13:29.528
The question, I guess, the point I want to make is for Alice, who is sort of representing the institutions here, is do the institutions have to find people who have that capacity to

13:29.879 --> 13:57.760
that knows books and have the experience with rare books and also have the responsibility and are hired and given the responsibility to contact the private collectors so that the institution is becoming very active but there's a responsibility given to an individual so that a great part of their work is to develop the relationship with the private collectors.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.700
I mean, is that a future?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.923
Do you see that?

14:03.943 --> 14:13.013
Do you mean, is it difficult for us to find these people, or is it difficult to... Does it become a priority for the institution, or should it become a priority?

14:13.654 --> 14:18.880
Yeah, I think that I may be among the fortunate few.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.463
It's not a conflict that I've ever felt.

14:22.144 --> 14:25.047
I feel encouraged and...

14:25.432 --> 14:35.245
able to do that, that that is very much considered part of what I'm there to do.

14:38.970 --> 14:51.726
I think there may be sort of things in back of your question that I may not be seeing or hearing because although certainly there are some collectors for whom

14:51.925 --> 15:07.544
There's a greater institutional interest for another purpose and that can sometimes create a different dynamic if there's a trustee who is also a collector.

15:08.446 --> 15:16.836
But I don't think, at least in my situation, that there hasn't been a way to sort of make

15:17.052 --> 15:28.505
my contacts feel very open and book-focused and not in conflict with the other goals of the institution or relationships that the institution might have.

15:28.926 --> 15:33.991
Are you suggesting that development people should participate with the libraries and developing the collectors?

15:35.573 --> 15:45.945
I guess I'm suggesting that the dealers have a very strong incentive to meet and develop

15:46.297 --> 16:00.833
private collectors, on an institutional level, because of the problems of development office and so forth, the institutions have a more difficult time giving responsibility on a curatorial level or on a career book level.

16:02.414 --> 16:04.977
Yeah, that clarifies it a little bit.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.722
There is a very formal process of clearance.

16:10.158 --> 16:22.101
at the University of Chicago that I think is not uncommon at most institutions, but that would only be if we were to approach somebody for a very substantial cash gift.

16:22.221 --> 16:27.151
Gifts in kind are really treated very, very differently.

16:27.532 --> 16:32.301
In fact, I think that the real educational process that I've

16:32.568 --> 16:49.834
found to be very worthwhile but somewhat time-consuming is educating our central development staff about the libraries, collecting areas, and some of the things that we were talking about this morning because it

16:50.911 --> 17:03.825
has been the case that sometimes someone from the development office will go to visit with someone and see some books that look old on the shelf and say, oh, I'm sure our library would love them.

17:05.367 --> 17:19.483
So it's almost the other way to make sure that it's understood that I'm always interested in knowing that and following up on that, but that understanding how the collection might fit in

17:19.463 --> 17:28.453
is something that really is the process we've been talking about this morning and really needs to be handled by someone who has that knowledge.

17:29.174 --> 17:33.699
It really does make a difference who's at the top, though, in universities, as I think we all know.

17:33.719 --> 17:44.612
I mean, I think there's no question that Norman Byron's path in building a new wing with JCP and so forth was greatly aided by the fact that Martin Gregorian had gone from NYP out of being president of Brown.

17:44.832 --> 17:47.175
There was a president who was very, very conscious

17:47.695 --> 17:50.520
of the issues of special collections.

17:51.281 --> 18:06.327
And certainly I know while the present administration at Yale has been very supportive of the library, having somebody like Bart G. Mahdi as president, a man who worked in the library and used the library and thought of the reading of the Bible to use his second home, made a difference.

18:06.347 --> 18:06.707
It helped.

18:08.851 --> 18:09.973
From the audience.

18:11.540 --> 18:16.305
Whoever's wondering, are you the only mic wondering then?

18:20.249 --> 18:20.690
Thank you.

18:20.810 --> 18:21.851
My name is Cheryl Thurber.

18:21.951 --> 18:23.633
I'm actually, is it on?

18:23.653 --> 18:24.113
You're fine.

18:24.334 --> 18:24.554
Okay.

18:24.914 --> 18:32.442
I'm actually both a collector and a scholar, and I do appreciate your comments in terms of the importance of scholarship.

18:32.482 --> 18:39.150
I think that side of things, use in scholarship, is what we haven't had much discussion of today.

18:39.230 --> 18:41.412
And I think it's an area that

18:41.560 --> 18:46.129
Libraries, in particular, need to figure out ways in terms of reaching out to scholars.

18:46.730 --> 19:00.177
My own frustration, both as a scholar and a collector, has frequently been, there are things that I want to see in archives, I don't find them, therefore I build my own collections, I build my own collections, and I say,

19:00.460 --> 19:05.346
Well, it's not the high spots, the rare stuff.

19:05.366 --> 19:07.288
I have the broad-based things.

19:07.308 --> 19:12.014
What do I deal with my collections after I'm through with my research?

19:12.034 --> 19:15.939
And I've certainly gone through various collections in my lifetime.

19:15.959 --> 19:21.726
As I mentioned at lunchtime to someone, I started off collecting comic books as a child.

19:21.706 --> 19:27.273
And I still have an enormous record collection that I'm not quite sure what to do with.

19:27.874 --> 19:30.337
Tons of, and I say literally tons of 78s.

19:30.658 --> 19:36.886
But I think we really need to see more effort in terms of reaching out to use, to scholarship.

19:37.647 --> 19:42.794
If all you've got is collections, then what is the point of it?

19:42.854 --> 19:44.436
Do things have to be used?

19:44.476 --> 19:46.379
We have to gather information.

19:46.439 --> 19:49.603
Curiosity is generally what drove it in the first place.

19:49.769 --> 19:53.217
And if you're not continuing curiosity, then it's a dead collection.

19:55.002 --> 19:59.873
Before people on the panel respond, could you clarify or go into slightly more detail?

19:59.893 --> 20:01.477
I have several librarians' eyebrows.

20:01.537 --> 20:03.863
Why not?

20:04.147 --> 20:10.338
those of us who work daily creating lives and making lives much easier for scholars.

20:10.579 --> 20:19.656
Could you go a little into what it is that a library would do beyond creating fellowships and the additional things that would be considered outreach to scholars?

20:20.237 --> 20:28.011
I think creating fellowships I think is a very important part of it because most scholars are stuck in

20:28.666 --> 20:30.829
not having the funds to be able to travel.

20:30.909 --> 20:33.853
So travel grants certainly make a tremendous difference.

20:33.873 --> 20:40.902
But it's also, I think we need to see more in the way of fellowships that are coming from a variety of institutions.

20:41.103 --> 20:45.669
If you're working on a specific topic, one of the topics I've been working on is 19th Century Sunday School.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.853
There are a few things in a few places.

20:48.973 --> 20:54.741
No single place, in a sense, has an appropriate fellowship or would it work.

20:54.761 --> 20:58.065
But I think we need to have more fellowships available

20:58.231 --> 21:02.698
to allow scholars in terms of visiting a lot of collections.

21:02.738 --> 21:11.311
I know the American Antiquarian Society, the Chicago Historical Society, there are a couple of joint fellowships.

21:11.332 --> 21:16.780
I think we need to see more of those kinds of things, but also things like exhibits.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.947
bringing in the people who know the subject matter.

21:20.988 --> 21:27.981
I mean, I've been to so many exhibits over the years that said, why didn't they call on this person or that person who knows the topic?

21:28.602 --> 21:37.238
And I think that's an area, whether it's libraries or museums, I think we need to draw upon subject matter experts far more than they've done.

21:37.258 --> 21:39.342
That's something the libraries can certainly use.

21:46.612 --> 22:01.056
Maybe this is too commonplace, but I'm interested in hearing your comments on the notion of critical mass as a nexus between the collector and the librarian.

22:01.076 --> 22:03.119
We have had some discussion of books.

22:03.139 --> 22:13.176
This artifact builds more or less phrase, the icon embedded in the artifact, but that passion of collecting does lead to the completers, the people like me who want.

22:13.240 --> 22:17.928
all of everything, and libraries and collectors seem to come together here.

22:19.110 --> 22:34.675
One copy of Blair's Lectures of Bridge on rhetoric might seem to be enough for some people, but if you really want to get a feel of what was going on in, let's say, before 1850 in formal education, you'd want to see all

22:35.043 --> 22:37.005
50 of them lined up there.

22:37.025 --> 22:43.151
And you can't do that unless you go to Harvard and stop by my house for a drink somewhere.

22:43.171 --> 22:51.258
I'd say as an institution that has over 150 copies of the Leaves of Grass, I haven't had a problem with this conversation.

22:51.278 --> 23:01.388
I don't know if any of us can hear the word critical mass without thinking of Bill's critical mess in the New Yorker profile of Michael Dimon.

23:02.009 --> 23:11.868
In a sense, yes, there is a point that collectors reach and that libraries reach where you begin to make connections and see things that individually you might not.

23:11.948 --> 23:19.022
But I guess I would say that for both collectors and for institutions, it very much depends on

23:19.407 --> 23:22.213
What kind of collection you're building?

23:22.334 --> 23:35.323
What is it something that is focusing on the sort of printing and publishing history, the bibliographical story behind that text?

23:35.742 --> 23:55.168
or is it the text itself and that will sort of determine the number of copies of the leaves of grass that you know sort of fulfill that need so I guess I find it hard to answer in a vacuum because I think the answer would vary so much depending on the goals of the collection and it's also

23:55.148 --> 24:09.045
as you point out, very much a place where collectors and libraries meet because sometimes it is the marriage, sorry Mary, but even the passionate marriage of those two forces that creates that critical mass.

24:09.125 --> 24:19.198
In other words, that if you as a collector are working with a library that is a natural fit, one of the reasons is because your collection

24:19.415 --> 24:30.446
will fill out and really deepen the resources related to that particular collecting area that the library can make available.

24:30.466 --> 24:42.657
I think your collection on rhetoric is also an excellent example of a topic where the original artifact makes a great deal of difference because I would suspect that many of your texts are annotated.

24:43.398 --> 24:48.443
And as the history of the book develops, the reader response to the text

24:48.895 --> 24:52.199
in the form of annotation can become increasingly significant to all of us.

24:52.259 --> 25:11.404
So having multiple copies or multiple editions that have some kind of added significance to them from the reader becomes tremendously important to have in one place and provide a scholar with an opportunity they wouldn't have otherwise if they had to go from one institution to another.

25:11.424 --> 25:15.730
A lot of the books have female names after the student.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.388
female institute of learning you never heard of.

25:18.448 --> 25:22.016
Remember, ownership does not equal readership.

25:22.036 --> 25:31.296
I would like to comment on critical mass is a variable term that really degrades it so subjective.

25:31.497 --> 25:35.305
Most special collections are return institutions.

25:35.420 --> 25:46.137
that have multiple collections and trying to identify overlay what they need or would like versus what the collector has are quite often incompatible.

25:46.558 --> 25:52.467
But the collector often doesn't know what the institutions need or have.

25:52.683 --> 26:04.376
What a collector has to do is recognize that at some point in their, after they have mass material, and that amassing of the material becomes an organized collection, that's sort of a logic.

26:04.476 --> 26:07.119
Then at some point it's approaching, coming to rest.

26:07.700 --> 26:19.213
At that point, the collector may have to look for the institution, because the institutions aren't gonna look for you, and say, well, I have this collection, and 90% or 80% of it

26:19.430 --> 26:23.015
has value to that institution, and then you negotiate.

26:23.035 --> 26:37.033
But the fact is that there's an inconsistency, and the institutions overall have not done as aggressively as I think they should have in educating the collectors as to their wants, their goals.

26:37.053 --> 26:41.559
They need to define it and sort of have an organic hold to the whole process.

26:41.579 --> 26:43.221
I don't think that mass is there yet.

26:43.982 --> 26:47.867
I think you always have that struggle at least in the next decade or so.

26:49.805 --> 27:13.045
I'm listening to a lot of concerns about passion in the institution because we all know that collectors have passion and both sellers definitely have passion about the things that they're selling and the things that they're collecting.

27:13.835 --> 27:21.246
I don't think, I mean, as a young librarian, I understand this concern because I see it.

27:21.266 --> 27:36.788
I see the lack of it, and I see it in pockets in the institutions, the sort of older institutions, Harvard and Brown, and also sometimes in the sort of struggling special collections of, smaller special collections in other libraries.

27:37.529 --> 27:41.715
And I don't think that you can institutionalize passion

27:42.202 --> 28:01.822
But I think that you can, I mean, thereby it's very main nature, but I do think that you can value the passion that your workers have and give them a little bit more room to indulge in that and give them a little more encouragement to outreach, so to speak, to collectors, to booksellers, and that sort of thing.

28:01.842 --> 28:07.247
And so I guess my sort of two cents is that

28:07.818 --> 28:17.869
when you're thinking about development, when you're thinking about reallocating things, thinking about staffing a little bit, padding your staff a little bit more.

28:17.890 --> 28:36.711
I don't know if padding is the right term, but to give more time, I mean, I love to just sort of browse through the dense collection of the JCB and re-realize what a wonderful place it is and other collections like it, but sometimes there's just not the time.

28:37.163 --> 29:04.065
certainly when people come and realize things about our collection i love it because they give me a new perspective on something on a book that i've handled two or three times a day i've never thought of in this particular aspect so you know it's got to be a loosening in some respects stop clenching so much you know when you're thinking about rare books don't you know shudder when someone picks up your books you know uh

29:04.568 --> 29:06.991
try to get people to handle them more, do more outreach.

29:07.011 --> 29:13.979
That's, I think, what I think is very important for librarians to try to do.

29:15.200 --> 29:33.681
Actually, I'll rise to the defense of my profession now, because we spent the afternoon pretending that librarians don't have passion, and I would argue very strongly that many of us who devoted our entire careers to living and working with our books do that on a basis of passion, and that I think that's one of the central shared

29:33.863 --> 29:35.445
themes that we have here today.

29:35.506 --> 29:44.239
So I would just like to put a word in for the considerable amount of time and energy that my colleagues place in this work.

29:47.724 --> 29:51.550
Like any other field, there are a variety of personalities around materials.

29:51.590 --> 29:57.740
Those are both handled well and badly by all three sectors.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.664
So I'm not quite sure I would want

30:00.982 --> 30:23.057
Many of my colleagues in this room have spent the last ten years opening up their collections, giving classes, doing exhibitions, producing things online, encouraging people to come in and work with the materials, would claim that that all comes from a sense of fashion, though I think your encouragement to give people more time and to understand that that's important to be developed is one that's well taken.

30:23.037 --> 30:27.603
Well, I think it's important that you do, Mark.

30:27.623 --> 30:37.196
But I also think that the people who were present here are almost by definition on the good side of this discussion.

30:37.277 --> 30:44.927
And those of us, I think maybe more dealers, have been participants in some of the train wrecks that have resulted

30:45.262 --> 31:04.911
For those who were in the basement in 1986, especially in the basement of the Franklin Institute, where they destroyed their rare book collection, or those who managed to make it to the unpublicized and tearing part of the British Art Office collection, which was held in the basement in Whitehall before they got out of the building.

31:05.452 --> 31:15.066
Or for that matter, anybody who has, like myself, had half a ton of guillotine New York Public Library film books dumped on their front doorstep at 7 in the morning.

31:15.637 --> 31:17.859
would have a different view of this.

31:17.879 --> 31:25.446
So I do feel glad you said that, because I feel that we've been too hard on a lot of people here who do wonderful jobs.

31:25.967 --> 31:35.416
But at the same time, when you've seen the graphic evidence of the system gone wrong, that's what I think makes collectors jumping.

31:36.096 --> 31:39.380
Booksellers just have to deal with it.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.000
A collector knows.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.982
I mean, I've been about

31:42.282 --> 31:45.609
in various special collections and libraries around the country.

31:46.591 --> 31:48.616
Kind of, for some odd reason, something very normal.

31:49.057 --> 31:55.330
And you know, when you're with someone, it's not so, it's passion's part of it, but it's someone who's a good book person.

31:55.765 --> 31:59.149
And you don't have to .

31:59.169 --> 32:10.662
And probably, in my personal experience, one of the examples I had was that Alice came to Cleveland once, not long ago, to look over my collection of visitors.

32:11.422 --> 32:12.724
And she spent two hours.

32:12.744 --> 32:15.787
I have a very large book, 1870.

32:15.987 --> 32:18.771
And she spent three hours looking at this one book.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.052
Now, that was, to me, passion.

32:20.420 --> 32:26.710
And that, to me, reflects the kind of person that should be idealized in the special collection series.

32:26.730 --> 32:29.774
Not always, but those are the kind of things you reach for.

32:30.776 --> 32:31.197
Sorry.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.899
Oh, no, not at all.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.885
We'll talk about it later.

32:36.905 --> 32:41.132
I think Merrily invoked the N-word earlier this afternoon.

32:41.252 --> 32:47.862
And I guess I'm thinking increasingly toward the end of this day, more than I did at the beginning, that

32:47.842 --> 33:12.668
In addition to marketing our collections, we sort of need to market what we're doing because, you know, people have, I and others have used the term communication, but we clearly, Mark spoke eloquently, I share all his views about how we define our work and what brings us to it and keeps us at it and that

33:13.002 --> 33:20.713
is very much a commitment to working with scholars, opening the collections, working with collectors, sharing our passion.

33:21.114 --> 33:24.198
But clearly that message is not sort of getting across.

33:24.278 --> 33:42.925
And I think that one of the sea changes in libraries in the past few years is certainly an awareness that the library profession needs to market what it is doing, what it offers, why is it different from

33:42.905 --> 33:55.398
what students get off Yahoo or if the library is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars licensing various electronic databases so faculty can get them on their desktops.

33:55.418 --> 34:03.305
We need to be sure that faculty understand they get them on their desktops because the libraries are delivering it to them, not magically because they come there.

34:03.806 --> 34:12.895
And so I think that the library profession itself is looking at what it needs to do to get the word out about what it's doing and why it's important.

34:12.875 --> 34:16.719
to do a lot more of that as well.

34:16.739 --> 34:21.423
I think we have time for one more question.

34:21.523 --> 34:23.105
One quick one on Nick Basme.

34:23.665 --> 34:26.828
A phrase I've heard at least three times today is dead collections.

34:27.469 --> 34:30.872
A phrase I've heard used at least three times today is dead collections.

34:30.932 --> 34:31.893
Terry used it.

34:31.933 --> 34:39.861
My name is Nick Basme and I write about people such as Bob and Bill.

34:40.077 --> 34:44.081
A phrase I've heard used at least three times today is dead collections.

34:44.121 --> 34:44.882
Terry used it.

34:44.902 --> 34:46.083
This woman over here used it.

34:46.103 --> 34:48.085
I think someone else used it.

34:48.325 --> 34:53.410
Number one, do you acknowledge that perhaps there are dead collections at your institutions?

34:53.450 --> 34:53.930
Number one.

34:53.970 --> 35:07.484
Number two, when you are negotiating with collectors for the possible benefaction or gift of collections, do they have to support the curriculum that you have at your institution?

35:07.504 --> 35:09.966
Is that some sort of prerequisite like that?

35:10.857 --> 35:32.410
I would like to think that there's, I wouldn't even want to put nine lives on a collection, but I think one of the great joys that I have seen is that a collection that was acquired to support a particular area of research interest 75 years ago,

35:32.795 --> 35:38.273
people come back and look at it with a totally different set of eyes and see different things.

35:38.393 --> 35:45.015
We've talked a lot about icons and artifacts and eye spots, you know, today and

35:45.620 --> 36:15.559
trying to understand why when texts are available through octavo and any number of other you know what is the value of the artifact in in a library when the need for it as information container um is supplanted well you know as bill um mentioned in uh referring to the surge of interest in book history people look at these things now for dividing for the marginalia for the provenance for the evidence of of

36:15.809 --> 36:19.474
what was the impact of that particular volume in anyone's life.

36:19.494 --> 36:35.656
So I guess I would say that collections continue to be reborn and when I look at a collection I don't say what is the sort of one-to-one match with a curricular emphasis but how can we breathe life into it?

36:36.357 --> 36:41.023
What can it tell us and therefore students and faculty that

36:41.611 --> 36:56.384
the paperback, the CD-ROM hand, and then I go out and try to make that page to faculty who can use it.

36:56.404 --> 37:11.618
Yeah, I'm gonna quickly tell a story to end this, because I believe there's no such thing as a net collection, that the reason great institutions exist is to preserve things for that moment when somebody needs them, when it will be the key that will open the door for them.

37:12.138 --> 37:16.323
And again, out of the New York Public Library, the accessions, I'll tell you a little tale.

37:17.304 --> 37:26.295
Michael Zinman, bless his heart, thought about half a tractor trailer load of things that had been filmed by the New York public and then got rid of.

37:27.076 --> 37:29.880
And he and I spent days going through this stuff.

37:29.920 --> 37:38.550
And in it, we found an Italian algebra book printed in Missoula, Montana in 1943 by Mimeograph.

37:38.733 --> 37:40.616
Except it didn't say 1943.

37:40.656 --> 37:47.084
On the front wrappers, it had the fascists and the year XXII.

37:47.145 --> 37:49.928
In other words, the fascist date for 1943.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.233
And we stared at this and said, what's this?

37:53.253 --> 37:54.054
We had no idea.

37:54.074 --> 37:54.955
I'd put it to one side.

37:55.796 --> 38:00.623
Ten days later, the New York Times had a story about how a group of Italian-Americans

38:01.092 --> 38:03.576
were starting a movement to get reparations from the U.S.

38:03.596 --> 38:12.590
government for having been interned during the war as potential enemies of the United States in the same way that Japanese Americans successfully prosecuted such a suit.

38:13.852 --> 38:18.780
And there's a picture of the primary concentration camp, which was Fort Missoula, Montana.

38:19.908 --> 38:20.929
And I called Michael up.

38:20.989 --> 38:22.091
I said, did you see this story?

38:22.111 --> 38:23.453
I said, you realize what this means?

38:23.553 --> 38:30.902
These people claim they were loyal Americans, but they were putting the fascist axis on the front cover and the fascist date.

38:30.922 --> 38:32.704
That doesn't seem very loyal.

38:32.764 --> 38:37.571
Michael immediately wrote a letter to the New York Times.

38:37.591 --> 38:41.516
The New York Times editorial page called him up, and they said, well, this is a very serious charge.

38:41.556 --> 38:42.196
We run this.

38:42.217 --> 38:44.039
We're going to have a lot of people mad at it.

38:44.059 --> 38:44.720
Where's your proof?

38:44.900 --> 38:48.885
Michael said, well, go to the New York Public Library and look at the microfilm.

38:48.865 --> 38:50.287
They called him back to ours later.

38:50.307 --> 38:52.490
They said, well, we did, but there are no wrappers there.

38:52.871 --> 38:55.935
There's no evidence of that.

38:55.996 --> 38:58.019
And Michael said, well, just you wait.

38:58.039 --> 39:00.963
He hopped in his car and drove down to the Times Building with the original.

39:00.983 --> 39:03.807
Well, it turns out when they filmed it, they didn't film the wrappers.

39:05.550 --> 39:13.962
So the New York Public Library collected this particular piece of evidence and it lay dormant without anybody looking at it for over half a century.

39:13.982 --> 39:15.244
But then the moment came.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.802
when suddenly it becomes a crucial piece of evidence.

39:17.902 --> 39:26.611
And that's what a great research institution is for, to hold that piece of evidence until the moment it's needed and to preserve it in the form where it really will be evidence.

39:27.472 --> 39:32.817
And that's what the New York Public Library had failed to do, because suddenly this piece becomes a crucial issue.

39:33.578 --> 39:38.963
And the New York Times ran Michael's letter with the reproduction of the wrapper on the letter page.

39:38.983 --> 39:41.746
But to me, that's what a research library is for.

39:41.806 --> 39:42.987
There's no such thing as a dead collection.

39:53.041 --> 39:56.405
Drawing to an end, I just had two final comments.

39:56.505 --> 40:00.750
I know my wife would raise her eyebrows and I only have two comments.

40:00.970 --> 40:05.456
The first is that I do believe there's a scarcity.

40:05.476 --> 40:15.688
I wanted to add from before that there is a scarcity of material, but I believe that in a sense of, like I did for a theory of uncertainty, we're living in a period of richness.

40:15.728 --> 40:19.032
The market is coming out with a great deal of material.

40:19.366 --> 40:44.402
It may not be repeated again, we may not be able to see it, but the Freelander sale is coming up this month, and the other sales have come up before, and there are others I know of that are coming up, demonstrates that there's a continuation of material that's coming up that were bought in the last part of the last century, and that we're going to see this for some years to come, and then I suspect there will be a drying up of early material.

40:45.364 --> 40:47.567
And the final comment is that

40:47.817 --> 40:59.773
It's clear to me that the richness and the vitality of the red book market both in terms of special collections and dealers and certainly collectors is certainly evidenced by the people in this room.

40:59.913 --> 41:03.818
So I applaud all of you for attending and thanking you for coming.

41:04.159 --> 41:08.004
Effectively, this demonstrates the richness of what we're doing.

41:08.725 --> 41:11.008
Any excitement?

41:11.028 --> 41:13.892
And in closing, I would like to second that.

41:14.817 --> 41:22.667
The agenda behind the questions that we originally posed many months ago before we put a flyer out for this,

41:22.968 --> 41:38.750
was to create an opportunity for librarians and collectors and dealers to talk amongst each other about the things that they cared the most and to find out those aspects of our language that's different so we can come to a better understanding.

41:38.790 --> 41:49.144
And given the buzz at lunch and at coffee break and presumably the buzz that will be going on at the reception in just a minute outside, I think we've succeeded

41:49.816 --> 42:08.938
greatly, and is due to the audience, and to the hard-working SAT, both of the Rare Book and Special Questions Division, and the Center for the Book, both of whom put in a little time and energy and commitment to make a possible ceremony.

42:09.172 --> 42:15.766
Thank you for making the Library of Congress for Book Forum's inaugural event a successful one.

42:16.388 --> 42:21.419
Please carry home the questions and the lessons and the contacts you've made.

42:21.720 --> 42:25.588
And we hope to see you in October for our next session.

42:25.788 --> 42:29.256
And go enjoy yourselves in the lobby.
