00:02.866 --> 00:06.853
I've never been in the military.

00:07.354 --> 00:08.697
Obviously, I've never been in combat.

00:08.857 --> 00:12.063
I've never been directly engaged in hazardous duty.

00:13.305 --> 00:21.941
All the cops I knew were long since out of it because they were by then detectives when I worked with them, or FBI men, who very seldom get shot and keep doing detective work.

00:21.962 --> 00:23.845
It happens, but not to anybody either.

00:24.365 --> 00:25.708
I got a new phone book recently.

00:26.410 --> 00:32.806
The old phone book had all the addresses and phone numbers that my kids had accumulated since they got out of Milton Academy in the mid-80s.

00:33.909 --> 00:38.821
It also had 14 names and addresses of people I knew pretty well, like death.

00:39.944 --> 00:41.327
And they were not in their 80s.

00:41.999 --> 00:45.463
These were people for whom the shade went up in their 40s and 50s.

00:46.304 --> 00:49.548
I lost one of my closest friends from law school in years 43.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.052
I am going to get it done today.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.916
I am never going to see this day again.

00:56.256 --> 01:03.165
If I don't get it done today, I'll try to get it done tomorrow, but if I have gone to a higher or lower jurisdiction, forgive me, I can't manage it.

01:03.185 --> 01:04.887
That's the way I live it.

01:04.907 --> 01:05.708
And that's the best way.

01:06.088 --> 01:07.450
And that is why

01:08.172 --> 01:11.457
That is how I justify the fact that I do not suffer.

01:11.477 --> 01:13.179
I will not do it.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.383
I will not be uncivil if I can avoid it.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.204
Coffee, sir?

01:16.384 --> 01:17.906
I'll have some coffee, please.

01:17.946 --> 01:19.228
Black coffee.

01:19.288 --> 01:19.809
Coffee, sir?

01:21.792 --> 01:21.892
Yeah.

01:21.912 --> 01:23.415
Want another glass of wine?

01:23.435 --> 01:24.977
If you have one, I'll have one.

01:25.478 --> 01:27.340
How much of a hurry is you when you get some time?

01:27.741 --> 01:30.705
My wife's picking up at 2.30, so I got a little bit of time.

01:30.725 --> 01:31.246
Let's have one, then.

01:31.266 --> 01:32.808
We don't see each other very often.

01:32.828 --> 01:34.551
We can justify that.

01:35.341 --> 01:37.906
My friend Jim.

01:39.248 --> 01:44.758
Take a nice nap and blame it on me, which you will.

01:45.459 --> 01:49.246
Like Deborah Carr, she in sympathy when you talk of this afterwards, and you will.

01:49.286 --> 01:53.333
Be kind.

01:53.393 --> 01:54.936
But if I find that you

01:56.266 --> 02:06.630
If I find myself in the company of an unintelligent person, never mind a pleasant, just unintelligent, somebody who doesn't really have anything to offer in conversation, which after all, what we live on,

02:07.387 --> 02:08.308
That's what we survive on.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.410
That's our sustenance.

02:10.271 --> 02:12.474
I will do my best, and it's pretty good by now.

02:12.514 --> 02:13.916
I've developed a lot of training.

02:14.016 --> 02:17.601
Sir, another of the white, two Chardonnays.

02:17.701 --> 02:19.103
Two Chardonnays.

02:19.123 --> 02:19.764
I will get out of it.

02:21.146 --> 02:21.767
I will be gone.

02:22.608 --> 02:25.192
In intermission, my seat will be empty.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.694
Because I haven't got time.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.555
My son...

02:27.535 --> 02:29.677
My son really gave me a great insight.

02:29.718 --> 02:35.164
When he got his condo, he works from Microsoft, because you and I probably will be by the end.

02:35.184 --> 02:36.305
Well, he works here.

02:36.786 --> 02:38.448
He's a consultant.

02:38.708 --> 02:39.829
Well, John works here.

02:39.849 --> 02:41.091
He's a consultant.

02:41.111 --> 02:43.193
This company was bought by Microsoft, but he didn't go.

02:44.415 --> 02:47.899
Anyway, when he got his condo, he refused to have a television.

02:49.180 --> 02:55.247
He said the reason is he wastes too much time watching television, particularly ESPN, when he should be reading books.

02:56.206 --> 02:59.590
And I'd say, I've got a smart kid here.

02:59.610 --> 03:03.634
So now I watch television while I'm riding my goddamn exercise.

03:03.694 --> 03:06.658
Well, that's a good time to do it.

03:06.678 --> 03:08.700
It is, because exercise is boring.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.082
I watch 20 minutes of television.

03:10.803 --> 03:13.526
I know it's not enough exercise, but that's all I'll do, and I will do that.

03:13.546 --> 03:15.808
It's good for your heart.

03:16.028 --> 03:18.451
And it's good for the lower limbs, too, because it gets them moving.

03:18.471 --> 03:21.635
20 is the least, that's your aerobic threshold.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.458
Until I just pop a slight sweat in the winter.

03:24.607 --> 03:26.630
in the summertime of town.

03:28.011 --> 03:30.134
And even if it isn't enough, I will do that.

03:30.194 --> 03:32.096
And if you tell me I've got to do 40 minutes, I won't do it.

03:32.116 --> 03:32.657
That's all.

03:32.717 --> 03:33.819
Simple.

03:33.839 --> 03:44.632
So I watch 20 minutes of television, during which I see 12 minutes of commercials, four minutes of badinage among the weatherman and the sportscaster and the newscaster, and maybe two or three actual minutes of news.

03:44.652 --> 03:46.595
But I get that done.

03:46.615 --> 03:47.796
Then I go into the living room.

03:47.776 --> 03:50.600
We generally eat between 7.30 and 8.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.044
And I read periodicals until we eat.

03:53.585 --> 03:56.630
I can't quite keep up doing it that way, but I can come close.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.012
Do you still read the periodicals?

03:58.032 --> 03:59.154
All those periodicals?

03:59.314 --> 03:59.855
Not as many.

03:59.915 --> 04:01.157
I cull them every year or so.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.201
I've dropped car and driver and road and track, for example.

04:03.221 --> 04:04.523
I'm now down to automobile.

04:04.543 --> 04:05.043
That's a lot.

04:05.304 --> 04:05.584
It is.

04:06.085 --> 04:07.287
I dropped...

04:07.823 --> 04:09.686
Transatlantic Review.

04:10.047 --> 04:10.588
Transatlantic.

04:10.608 --> 04:12.451
You're into TLS.

04:12.471 --> 04:13.092
I try to.

04:13.152 --> 04:16.858
I just re-subscribe because my friend Donald Penner .

04:17.298 --> 04:19.262
I dropped it once and I've started again.

04:19.282 --> 04:20.744
And they pile up.

04:20.764 --> 04:22.367
You know, you almost dread to see the postman.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.248
That's embarrassing.

04:23.268 --> 04:26.493
There's all these unopened.

04:26.794 --> 04:33.645
Well, then after dinner, I read from approximately 8.30 or so.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.696
9 o'clock, somewhere in there, and drink coffee until 10.

04:37.756 --> 04:39.299
And by then, I'm not absorbing it.

04:39.319 --> 04:48.214
I read books during that period, which is why I'm as far as only as I just started yours the other night.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.276
And I do retain it.

04:49.296 --> 04:51.600
I do absorb, and I do enjoy what I'm reading.

04:51.580 --> 04:52.962
But by 10 o'clock, I'm finished.

04:52.982 --> 04:59.631
And by 10 o'clock, oddly enough, the networks seem to be willing, except this week, to put on something that will divert.

04:59.651 --> 05:03.317
And I watch that, and so the news comes on, and I watch that and go to bed.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.219
And the next day, repeat the mixture as before.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.663
And I like this life.

05:07.683 --> 05:12.650
My friend Jay Goodman, who was with Stanford with me, teaches at Wheaton, has been for 35 years.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.894
He says, what I've done is reinvent the life of the graduate student.

05:16.315 --> 05:20.541
Only now they're paying me.

05:20.521 --> 05:29.330
When you have these kids, and I'm sure that any kid at VU can't get into the writing class.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.531
It's by submission.

05:30.992 --> 05:38.119
I have a limit of a ceiling of 15 on the afternoon class, which is 4 o'clock, and a ceiling of 20 on the evening class, which is 3 o'clock.

05:38.859 --> 05:42.904
And you get into there by showing me that you've got some talent in writing.

05:42.924 --> 05:49.330
And I would imagine that on a less demanding basis, we still don't suffer from that class anymore.

05:49.310 --> 05:53.357
I mean, you still have to have, you're not going to put up with a shit if a kid doesn't write.

05:53.377 --> 05:56.523
I don't think it does a service to a kid to tell him he can write when he can't.

05:56.603 --> 06:00.890
I've had people plead with me to let them into the course, and I've had to tell them to their faces, and I'm good enough.

06:01.511 --> 06:05.278
And the course proceeds on the Sephardic method.

06:05.418 --> 06:07.622
It's all dialogue.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.748
You're going to be criticized in front of your peers, and they're going to criticize you.

06:11.768 --> 06:16.956
It's definitely fairly civil, because everybody realizes it's going to be a good turn in the barrel.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.940
So we're generally pretty nice to each other, but nevertheless severe.

06:20.441 --> 06:22.143
If the story doesn't work, you're going to hear about it.

06:22.163 --> 06:22.884
You're going to hear why.

06:23.465 --> 06:26.349
If you take this information to have, the chances are you write better stories.

06:26.910 --> 06:30.776
And if you take it, if you're feeling straight, you should drop out while you still can.

06:30.796 --> 06:31.577
We'll drop in the books.

06:31.617 --> 06:36.985
I tell them flat out, not in an ugly or overbearing fashion, I hope, but it's a matter of stating facts.

06:37.724 --> 06:46.955
And when I've been asked by another professor to let somebody in whose submission convinced me that he or she was not qualified, I have said, no, it's not a kindness.

06:46.975 --> 06:50.018
Because people have gotten into that class when I've made a mistake in judgment.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.663
And they've gotten ripped to shreds, and they've left.

06:54.804 --> 06:56.526
And they blame you, probably.

06:56.546 --> 07:01.412
I don't know whether they blame me or themselves or their mothers and fathers or the stars in the sky.

07:01.692 --> 07:04.896
But it's a very unpleasant experience, and I prefer it not happen to them.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.659
This course is supposed to be fun.

07:08.460 --> 07:17.052
The creative writing course, the purpose of it is to legitimatize the fact that you're spending your study time writing stories instead of reading books.

07:17.512 --> 07:18.414
That's what it's for.

07:19.175 --> 07:29.209
It makes it okay for you to spend, well, you get three credits, four credits, one quarter of your study time writing stories.

07:29.229 --> 07:31.592
Of course, most of them are going to spend a half if they really get into it.

07:32.095 --> 07:36.253
I near flunked out of Stanford graduate school because I was writing a bad book.

07:36.273 --> 07:38.764
Too bad, wasn't it?

07:38.824 --> 07:41.194
So I'm just as rigorous as I can be.

07:41.933 --> 07:46.299
simply because it's so unpleasant, and I'm wrong.

07:46.319 --> 07:52.348
And now and then I'll get a kid who submits a story that was the crowning achievement of his previous writing course, and that's okay.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.815
And something has happened to him, and you know it instantly.

07:56.835 --> 07:58.658
You know it instantly, don't you?

07:58.678 --> 08:03.705
That it's been... Yeah, because they don't bother to type out a new copy.

08:03.685 --> 08:04.486
Simple.

08:05.848 --> 08:15.681
You can tell, you know, the guy spilled his coffee on it.

08:17.984 --> 08:24.332
It's a vicious sport, and since the invention of the computer, it's awfully difficult for these kids to get published.

08:24.352 --> 08:26.175
I'm inventing a new course now.

08:26.195 --> 08:30.300
I don't know whether it will go over with the department, but I'm going to give it a try.

08:30.702 --> 08:33.124
I'd like you to learn.

08:33.144 --> 08:37.028
The courses I have now are advanced fiction writing colon for publication.

08:37.048 --> 08:39.911
This would be advanced nonfiction writing for publication.

08:39.931 --> 08:42.153
It would be out of the essay.

08:43.775 --> 08:45.737
Oh, I don't think so.

08:45.817 --> 08:50.081
I think it would be easier because they could get the market.

08:50.101 --> 08:52.284
Oh, it's certainly better than short fiction.

08:52.384 --> 08:52.944
That's for sure.

08:53.004 --> 08:54.926
Well, then you've got an improvement right there.

08:54.946 --> 09:00.692
There is no course in the catalog that I can find.

09:01.347 --> 09:23.389
which would which this would do for them this would be of course for people it's particularly good for pretty well students they could lose all the clarity they can get in there i'd love to teach a course of literary criticism they bring in the galley of the book that you can't go and find a review on

09:23.690 --> 09:25.192
Give it to the film, you know?

09:26.113 --> 09:26.873
You're all alone.

09:27.474 --> 09:29.396
You have nothing to taste.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.437
Yeah.

09:30.617 --> 09:31.458
No CliffsNotes.

09:31.478 --> 09:32.960
No, nothing.

09:34.021 --> 09:34.962
That'd be great.

09:35.002 --> 09:36.944
Wouldn't that be interesting?

09:36.964 --> 09:37.304
Sure would.

09:37.324 --> 09:39.006
Yeah, I'm proud of that.

09:39.046 --> 09:39.967
Why don't you offer to the price?

09:39.987 --> 09:41.389
Yeah, there's just tons of new things.

09:41.469 --> 09:48.936
I'd give them all to the clock library and start with 50 cents, you know, whatever.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.898
But, you know, it's easy.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.380
We offer it at Clara.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.115
I thought of it.

09:54.155 --> 09:54.656
You should.

09:55.898 --> 09:58.782
And get an honest amount of money on it.

09:59.043 --> 10:03.830
I still think I'm still establishing who I am.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.693
But these things feed on each other.

10:05.773 --> 10:06.354
They do.

10:07.095 --> 10:12.023
I will say when I'm thinking of the papers, I'll never go down before we begin.
