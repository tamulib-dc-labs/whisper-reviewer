WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:05.937
Morning.

00:05.957 --> 00:09.501
Mr. Norris, if you would just kindly give me your title.

00:09.681 --> 00:11.103
Yep.

00:11.123 --> 00:17.050
My name's Roger Norris, and I'm the Deputy Chapter Librarian in Durham.

00:17.611 --> 00:21.215
So that's the Deputy Librarian to the Dean and Chapter of Durham.

00:21.776 --> 00:24.379
Why don't you just tell me a bit about the room that we're in right now?

00:25.260 --> 00:25.360
Fine.

00:25.380 --> 00:32.468
Well, the room we're in now is the refectory of the monastery, and it's in the South Cloister,

00:33.072 --> 00:36.115
of the conventional complex of Durham Cathedral.

00:37.036 --> 01:02.320
It has an 11th century undercloth and this room is equipped with 17th century bookcases in the very traditional college library system that you see throughout Europe of press marks with each bookcase having a letter and each shelf having a number and then each book having a number within that shelf.

01:03.008 --> 01:26.046
The books that are kept in this room are mainly printed books between 1500 and 1800 and there is a big collection of music which is also here of cathedral books from the organ loft and from the choir and secular music as well and a lot of antiquarian manuscripts from the great historians of Durham County as well.

01:26.752 --> 01:30.196
And approximately how many titles would you say are in here?

01:30.216 --> 01:32.378
In here, probably just over 20,000.

01:32.638 --> 01:34.540
In the whole library, about 50,000.

01:34.641 --> 01:38.505
So it's quite a modest size as far as libraries go.

01:40.507 --> 01:42.309
And this is very much a working library.

01:42.329 --> 01:43.030
It is, yes.

01:43.831 --> 01:46.614
This is not something that's beautiful.

01:47.194 --> 01:51.639
Well, I hope it's both, but it is a working library.

01:51.659 --> 01:52.540
Tell me a little bit about...

01:52.857 --> 01:55.701
what this does for the scholar?

01:55.721 --> 01:58.064
What kind of scholar comes here?

01:58.324 --> 02:01.008
Printed books are quite difficult to exploit.

02:01.048 --> 02:04.112
The early printed books are not very much used.

02:04.152 --> 02:05.634
They're not very much used anywhere.

02:05.674 --> 02:19.692
The sort of material that is used most heavily, we find, amongst the antiquarian and early material is, first of all, music.

02:19.942 --> 02:31.057
We get lots of inquiries, both in person and by letter and by email, relating to the music that we've got, because that's quite an important collection.

02:31.518 --> 02:35.984
I think the use of collections depends on their uniqueness or their rarity.

02:37.026 --> 02:42.093
And then antiquarian collections are quite well used, but it is the music which is most heavily used.

02:42.493 --> 02:48.261
And then, of course, we also have a big collection of Anglo-Saxon and medieval...

02:49.203 --> 03:16.257
literary and scholarly manuscripts historical scientific musical legal from the prior and convent the the anglo-saxon ones of course come from lindisfarne jarrow mount wearmouth those early benedictine houses associated with chalfrith and benedict bishop and the venerable bead and of course saint cuthbert around whom this place is built

03:16.422 --> 03:19.545
And they were all here, these Anglo-Saxon and Bernardo Bede.

03:20.386 --> 03:21.627
Well Bede and St.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.108
Cuthbert are both buried in the cathedral.

03:23.489 --> 03:27.372
I know they are, but I mean that these manuscripts of which you speak are here.

03:27.552 --> 03:28.473
Some of them.

03:28.814 --> 03:31.696
Some Anglo-Saxon books from those early monasteries are here.

03:31.736 --> 03:42.887
We have about, I don't know, 15 or 20, which might be associated with those early houses and with the early foundation of Durham.

03:43.547 --> 03:44.168
And then...

03:44.688 --> 03:47.811
quite a number of 11th century and 12th century books as well.

03:48.291 --> 03:53.116
So we're particularly rich on those Anglo-Saxon things and 11th and 12th century material.

03:55.038 --> 04:04.207
But of course, at the dissolution of the monastery in 1539-40, a lot of books were dispersed throughout the country from all monasteries.

04:05.308 --> 04:11.114
The books that didn't survive at all anywhere are the liturgies, the service books of monasteries.

04:11.614 --> 04:13.716
They were destroyed, including here.

04:13.983 --> 04:15.284
Oh, including hearing everywhere.

04:15.645 --> 04:17.787
They're rare survivals.

04:17.928 --> 04:23.274
They represented so strongly the old regime that people wanted to get rid of memories of, I suppose.

04:23.334 --> 04:26.317
About a huge number of other books survived.

04:26.838 --> 04:27.839
Absolutely vast.

04:28.039 --> 04:39.332
And although we've got about 300 odd early manuscript books here from Durham, there are about another 200 or so

04:40.021 --> 04:42.224
surviving in other places from Darwin.

04:42.244 --> 04:50.834
And then other monasteries and their linear descendants into modern day cathedrals also have loads of manuscripts left that you'll know of.

04:50.854 --> 04:56.080
York, Worcester, Winchester, Canterbury, Westminster, all those places.

04:57.662 --> 05:03.248
And this, you mentioned that in this room were printed books 17th to 20th century.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.150
Yes, 16th to 20th century.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.552
16th to...

05:06.802 --> 05:08.284
18th century in here.

05:08.304 --> 05:12.450
And then in the dormitory, which we can look at in a while, they're the more modern books.

05:12.791 --> 05:15.715
Will we be able to see some of the manuscripts?

05:15.735 --> 05:19.361
Sure, yes, we'll do everything you want to do, that's fine.

05:20.082 --> 05:22.225
And this room dates from what?

05:22.245 --> 05:31.899
Well, originally it would date from the 13th century, 13th, 14th century, and then it's been heavily restored and altered, as you can see.

05:31.939 --> 05:34.463
The windows are 19th, 20th century,

05:34.780 --> 05:47.460
the upper part of the walls are probably 17th century and it's probably only the lower part which still has some remains of medieval wall paintings behind the wainscoting, behind the wooden panelling that is really original.

05:48.381 --> 05:52.628
How is it that this cathedral survived the dissolution?

05:52.648 --> 05:53.830
Oh, loads of cathedrals survived.

05:54.430 --> 06:02.543
It was a healthy, wealthy and quite well behaved cathedral and so I think that

06:03.350 --> 06:19.829
it was acknowledged that those cathedrals which were not corrupt, that were not impoverished, that had not put their foot in it, that they'd kept their noses clean, and they could survive.

06:19.909 --> 06:32.563
What happened was they were dissolved, the monastic institution was dissolved, and then within a very short time it was re-founded, a new charter given for

06:33.708 --> 06:39.575
a new cathedral with a dean and canons instead of a prior and convent.

06:39.595 --> 06:46.164
And indeed, the last prior of this monastery was the first dean, a man called Hugh Whitehead.

06:46.204 --> 06:50.729
So there was a strong continuity and no destruction of buildings or anything like that.

06:51.891 --> 07:00.201
Obviously, there was in a lot of other places, but I mean, a lot of places did survive reasonably intact.

07:00.221 --> 07:01.923
And who is that portrait of over there?

07:01.943 --> 07:03.445
That's a man called John Sudbury.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.441
Hello folks, can I help you at all?

07:07.204 --> 07:07.905
Can I help you at all?

07:11.730 --> 07:14.253
Okay, fine.

07:14.273 --> 07:23.505
That's a man called John Sudbury who provided the endowment for this, for the bookcases and for the furnishings in this room.

07:23.545 --> 07:26.429
But of course what you're sitting at is quite nice, you'll appreciate it.

07:26.769 --> 07:33.398
You're sitting on a monastic bench from the 15th century and you're sitting at a monastic table from the medieval refectory.

07:33.597 --> 07:37.782
on its original trestles, and there's another one up there with their benches as well.

07:38.123 --> 07:42.788
Well, can we assume then that some ancient copyists work at these tables?

07:43.870 --> 07:47.654
You could assume that some ancient copyists would eat at these tables.

07:48.155 --> 07:51.499
I think you can't assume that they would study or write.

07:51.559 --> 07:52.240
No.

07:52.280 --> 08:02.693
The monastatic scriptorium in northern Europe would mainly be in the north groisters of monasteries, because that's where you get most sunshine.

08:03.432 --> 08:21.240
I think after the 12th century, monastic scriptoria became less and less common as far as copying beautiful books went, that more and more you got companies of lay stationers, people being commissioned to do work, who wouldn't necessarily be religious or monks or anything of the sort.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.482
It became an institution.

08:22.622 --> 08:24.165
It became an industry, yeah.

08:24.185 --> 08:26.368
It became a profession, a craft, yeah.

08:26.669 --> 08:29.454
And, of course, the works went beyond, at that point, theological.

08:29.674 --> 08:31.017
Certainly, yeah.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.179
It became quite secular.

08:32.219 --> 08:33.461
That's right.

08:33.481 --> 08:36.687
Was there a scriptorium attached to this cathedral?

08:36.707 --> 08:38.630
Well, there was a place where writing could be done.

08:38.690 --> 08:42.417
I don't know whether we'd glorify it necessarily in the name of a scriptorium.

08:42.734 --> 08:44.376
But that would be in the North Croister, yeah.

08:44.716 --> 08:46.158
Is that something we'll be able to see?

08:46.178 --> 08:46.939
Yeah, yeah.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.662
It's not visible as a scriptorium anymore.

08:49.963 --> 08:54.629
It's nothing like what you see in Umberto Echoes, The Name of the Rose.

08:54.649 --> 09:00.636
But, because in Southern Europe, it doesn't matter where you have your scriptorium, because the light is so gorgeous anyway.

09:01.237 --> 09:07.444
But in Northern Europe, obviously, they had to be careful that they could exploit the daylight as much as possible.

09:07.464 --> 09:12.150
And so they would inevitably, where the croister is,

09:12.485 --> 09:12.926
That's right.

09:12.966 --> 09:17.551
The north cloister is the one that gets the great proportion of the sun in the north.

09:19.194 --> 09:21.396
Were these books chained once upon a time?

09:21.537 --> 09:22.177
No, no.

09:22.237 --> 09:24.961
Monastic books aren't chained, no.

09:25.161 --> 09:26.403
We're going out to Hereford tomorrow.

09:26.443 --> 09:28.185
Yeah, that's not a monastic library.

09:28.285 --> 09:31.149
That's a library of secular canons.

09:31.830 --> 09:39.960
The difference is that monastic books didn't usually have access

09:40.632 --> 09:49.420
to them by you and I. If we weren't monks, then we wouldn't get access to the books of a monastery.

09:51.402 --> 09:56.026
The cloister was the enclosure, so you and I didn't get into that.

09:58.709 --> 10:07.517
But, of course, in churches, in minsters, in Augustinian houses, places like Yorkminster, where there would be a

10:08.273 --> 10:12.419
a library not attached to a monastery, they might well have been chained, yes.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.861
And of course, Harryford, as you say.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.886
But ours never have been, no.

10:16.906 --> 10:27.282
And you'll also find in a public library, like Duke Humphrey's library, in the Bodleian, that they're chained, those early books are chained, because they were public.

10:27.302 --> 10:30.767
And so people could come in and use them, who might be anyone.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.591
They could also take them away if they weren't chained.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.736
Do you mind if I take a photograph of you right where you are?

10:36.996 --> 10:37.437
No.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.365
You might just want to fix your collar, haven't you?

10:39.385 --> 10:40.727
Really?

10:40.747 --> 10:41.508
Oh, your jacket here.

10:42.168 --> 10:42.769
Oh, right.

10:42.789 --> 10:43.490
Oh, yes, I see.

10:43.550 --> 10:44.391
Yes, how dreadful.

10:45.052 --> 10:49.097
Oh, gosh, it's probably been like that for weeks.

10:50.318 --> 10:54.643
So tell me what we call these peat pieces.

10:54.804 --> 11:06.698
I don't know what we call them, but the little areas where people will write in a monastic cloister are sometimes called carols, which is a sort of enclosure.

11:07.522 --> 11:22.981
But the bookcases here, I suppose, attempt to represent what the 17th century bivouphile thought that the monastic or the medieval library would look like.

11:23.882 --> 11:28.147
And it looks quite nice, doesn't it?

11:28.167 --> 11:28.708
It's beautiful.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.251
And these are all letters, so I see.

11:31.271 --> 11:33.874
Do we call these bays?

11:34.855 --> 11:36.297
We call them presses, actually.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.267
We call them presses, which is a name for a cupboard.

11:39.808 --> 11:40.489
Right.

11:40.509 --> 11:42.891
But I mean, the areas that they're in, they're almost like alcoves.

11:42.951 --> 11:43.751
That's right, yeah.

11:44.032 --> 11:45.833
But we call the bookcases presses.

11:45.853 --> 11:46.454
They are presses.

11:48.736 --> 11:50.337
And let's see, how many do we have?

11:50.357 --> 12:06.351
Well, we've got from B, excluding J, through to R. And so A is missing, but it isn't really, because it's been supplanted by something else.

12:06.820 --> 12:11.528
And S is also missing, but that isn't really because that's been changed, yeah.

12:12.289 --> 12:21.124
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18.

12:21.144 --> 12:22.967
It would have to be an even number.

12:23.908 --> 12:24.329
Okay.

12:24.449 --> 12:25.351
2, 4, 6, 8.

12:25.531 --> 12:26.373
It would have to be 16.

12:26.393 --> 12:26.573
16.

12:27.494 --> 12:27.595
Yeah.

12:29.257 --> 12:31.461
And tell me a bit about yourself.

12:32.234 --> 12:33.616
I'm just a librarian.

12:33.636 --> 12:35.579
Librarians are no ones, you know.

12:35.599 --> 12:45.515
Come on, let's go and have a look at our strongroom and then you can say, do you want to, how are we going to take it?

12:45.655 --> 12:56.352
Our strongroom, if you want to bring things up and look at them at your leisure, then you're very welcome to do that if you'd like to.

12:56.669 --> 12:58.932
What do you normally do in these places?

12:58.992 --> 13:05.501
Really, I'd like to get a sense of the ambience and some quotations from you that I can use.

13:06.582 --> 13:11.950
And give us an introduction to the institution and the holdings.

13:12.891 --> 13:13.131
Sure.

13:13.151 --> 13:15.514
I've got bits of paper that you can take away with you.

13:15.675 --> 13:16.336
That would be wonderful.

13:16.356 --> 13:18.198
That saves you taking too much away of notes.

13:18.218 --> 13:18.699
That's great.

13:18.759 --> 13:20.481
OK, do you want to?

13:20.501 --> 13:20.762
There we are.

13:20.782 --> 13:25.528
All right, let's go and do that one.

13:26.099 --> 13:31.825
Is this something that this one of these is this something we could get a little one of these little booklets?

13:31.865 --> 13:33.907
I haven't made any notes in it.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.188
Let's just make sure.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.750
Just came out yesterday.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.634
Oh, really?

13:40.694 --> 13:42.916
Okay.

13:42.936 --> 13:48.021
I'm just going to take my coat off.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.243
It's like there is compared to it everywhere else.

13:50.283 --> 13:51.364
It gets lovely lighting.

13:52.626 --> 13:53.887
The scriptorium would have been right here.

13:53.927 --> 13:54.247
That's right.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.089
And there would have been a series of desks

13:56.795 --> 13:58.136
against these windows.

13:58.376 --> 13:59.958
Well, would it have been open to the elements?

14:00.038 --> 14:00.919
No, it wouldn't, no.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.100
It would have been closed.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.181
It would have had windows.

14:05.443 --> 14:26.802
I think if you think of it without the dustbins or without the benches, and then you think of some of the cloisters that you see in Italian churches, it looks fairly similar with these buttresses, you know, which are concealed buttresses, which go up into the roof force, sitting out there.

14:27.693 --> 14:35.642
So you can see there are peg marks halfway up the wall where cupboards might have been.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.903
Hello.

14:57.106 --> 15:13.325
Well, what we have in here are the remains of the monastic library that we have.

15:13.345 --> 15:21.514
As I said to you before, these libraries from all over the place were dispersed to various places.

15:21.534 --> 15:24.177
People rescue books, really, they rescue books.

15:24.747 --> 15:28.812
which otherwise would have been damaged or lost altogether.

15:29.593 --> 15:46.413
And so there are about 300 volumes from... There's one fragment from the 6th century, and there's substantial pieces from the 7th and 8th centuries, 9th, 10th, and lots from the 11th and 12th, and then there are later books as well.

15:47.354 --> 15:52.780
And they cover all sorts of subjects, but as you might expect, the majority of subjects are biblical text,

15:53.080 --> 16:19.324
commentaries on books of the Bible by medieval commentators and then books by early fathers and by early medieval scholars like Gregory and Anselman Alcorn and people like that and then there are chronicles and a little bit of literature and classics and a lot of law and science

16:20.452 --> 16:26.681
Lives of the Saints, books about theology, all that sort of stuff.

16:26.701 --> 16:36.976
And it's a very austere library, although we do have some books which are very beautifully decorated, there aren't any which have got sort of full-page decorations or anything like that.

16:37.537 --> 16:47.792
So it was a very learned community, really, and I think that's why Eton and other similar ones like Canterbury and your...

16:48.700 --> 16:51.364
well York didn't have a community but it had a big library.

16:52.185 --> 17:05.286
Worcester, well Canterbury, Worcester and Durham particularly survived because they had their own colleges in Oxford and so they had a strong connection with secular learning as well.

17:06.327 --> 17:10.033
So it looks a bit of a mess in here at the moment because it's being used to store

17:10.267 --> 17:38.603
all the museum objects while the treasury is being restored so that's the coffin of st cutler there and it looks a bit odd because it's all covered up for its own protection but that's the coffin in which he was buried in 698 so um wasn't there a book found that's right yes well uh no there was a book which was dispersed at the distribution of the monasteries

17:38.819 --> 17:48.748
which was with his copy, which is a small Gospel according to St John, which is the Stonyhurst Gospel, which is owned by the Society of Jesus, and now on display in the British Library.

17:49.629 --> 18:06.025
And the Lindisfarne Gospels, we don't know whether they were here at the dissolution of the monasteries, they may have been, but of course they were rescued by Sir Robert Cotton, and became part of his cartonium collection, which is now part of the National Collection.

18:06.410 --> 18:14.258
The coffin was opened crucially in 1827, and that's when the cross was found.

18:15.459 --> 18:20.184
So anyway, what did you want to look at particularly?

18:20.764 --> 18:31.435
No, no, it wasn't very interesting, because there in Catalonia we have Beatus de Rihanna, we have in Nascogorje, there is a church, and we have Reatus de Rihanna.

18:32.416 --> 18:32.856
Beatus?

18:33.072 --> 18:35.776
And that's the name of the place, is it?

18:35.796 --> 18:38.922
No, it's the name of this kind of building now.

18:39.242 --> 18:40.104
Ah, right, right.

18:40.805 --> 18:44.130
I think two months ago it was stolen.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.633
Right, right.

18:45.933 --> 18:48.878
Later, now they found it.

18:49.018 --> 18:53.446
Ah, excellent, excellent.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.751
So what we can do is take some books up and then you can...

18:57.220 --> 19:04.108
We'll take three up and then you can have a look at them at your leisure.

19:04.288 --> 19:08.894
I think we do have a, I think we do have a scan.

19:08.914 --> 19:18.826
I'm not sure, I don't know.

19:18.846 --> 19:22.350
No, I don't do that.

19:24.423 --> 19:27.547
I know that we've got a Spanish Bible upstairs.

19:28.388 --> 19:31.832
You don't want to see Spanish Bibles, do you?

19:31.852 --> 19:33.695
While we're here, you might like to have a quick look at St.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.857
Cathar's Cross, as you won't get the opportunity to ever see it again.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.864
So that's the cross that was taken out of the coffin in 1827.

19:40.984 --> 19:46.050
It's made of gold and garlic stone, and it dates from the late 7th century.

19:46.691 --> 19:51.257
And you see it on all the armorials that are associated with Durham.

19:51.878 --> 19:54.422
for the last 170 years anyway.

19:55.504 --> 19:59.210
So... No, it's not.

19:59.230 --> 20:03.897
So it's normally on display that because of the refurbishment we haven't got it.

20:04.037 --> 20:13.412
And you see it's got a mend at the bottom piece which is an original break and it's been restored in the 7th century.

20:13.432 --> 20:15.756
Isn't that nice?

20:15.776 --> 20:17.239
Are his remains still buried?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.300
Yes, he's still buried here.

20:18.501 --> 20:19.422
That's what we hope he is anyway.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.681
She's got to have a wart.

20:22.961 --> 20:23.922
I don't think that's very nice.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.106
You both are so young to be interested in cannabula.

20:28.947 --> 20:29.488
Are you?

20:29.728 --> 20:34.032
Are you young to be interested in cannabula?

20:34.193 --> 20:35.194
Yes.

20:36.295 --> 20:47.286
If we take a saxophone and a twelfth century, that would give you an idea of the sort of stuff that propriety with.

20:47.306 --> 20:49.088
I think something

20:49.523 --> 20:56.113
To give you a sense of a Saxon book, there's only one, you know, American Saxon book, which is from the Shady Library.

20:56.474 --> 20:57.075
Which library?

20:57.095 --> 20:58.397
The Shady, William Shady.

20:58.517 --> 21:00.220
Oh, right.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.522
Whereabouts is that?

21:01.542 --> 21:02.223
It's at Princeton.

21:02.643 --> 21:04.827
It's a wonderful series of libraries.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.090
You've got all that part in the States.

21:07.110 --> 21:07.531
Gosh.

21:07.551 --> 21:10.916
I mean, there's only one Anglo-Saxon book, and all of nothing.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.518
Here you have 20 books.

21:12.719 --> 21:15.463
Oh, of course you should.

21:17.502 --> 21:20.025
Yeah, I think it all works out.

21:20.345 --> 21:23.309
It all works out.

21:23.329 --> 21:24.070
So let's see.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.432
Look at this page.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.655
There's an 8th century one there.

21:28.675 --> 21:31.398
There's an historical miscellany of the 11th century.

21:31.879 --> 21:34.181
I think you're probably quite into it.

21:34.201 --> 21:34.882
It looks all right, anyway.

21:35.202 --> 21:38.026
They're not very highly decorated, so don't be too disappointed.

21:38.626 --> 21:40.068
But we think they're quite nice.

21:40.108 --> 21:42.090
This would be an original blinding.

21:42.451 --> 21:43.272
Well, it's a bit late.

21:43.372 --> 21:45.214
It's a 14th century book.

21:45.683 --> 21:47.685
That's a service book.

21:48.085 --> 21:53.950
But if we get to do a 12th century one, that will probably take that one out.

21:53.990 --> 21:55.312
Right, do you want to have a look at them as well?

21:55.332 --> 21:57.834
Do you want to come up with it and look at them?

21:58.775 --> 21:59.716
Do you like to do that?

21:59.776 --> 22:02.478
No, probably at 4 o'clock.

22:02.498 --> 22:03.819
Yeah, I was leaving here.

22:03.839 --> 22:05.080
4 o'clock.

22:05.681 --> 22:06.402
4 o'clock.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.523
Won't take that long.

22:07.543 --> 22:08.764
Half an hour.

22:10.645 --> 22:11.787
Where are you going now?

22:12.627 --> 22:14.089
In terms of wandering around.

22:14.129 --> 22:14.769
Look around.

22:14.789 --> 22:15.690
Yeah, that's nice.

22:15.940 --> 22:22.470
You don't have to stay, if you don't want to stay.

22:22.951 --> 22:25.676
No, no, no, we want to stay the bonus time.

22:25.696 --> 22:27.759
Okay, right.

22:27.779 --> 22:34.470
Okay, can somebody else take that one?

22:40.559 --> 22:42.943
The bindings, as you probably can see,

22:43.227 --> 22:45.590
They're rather late, they're mostly 19th century.

22:45.991 --> 22:53.722
There are about 10 12th century ones, and quite a few 17th century rebounds there.

22:53.742 --> 23:00.211
But the high proportion are 19th century rebounds.

23:00.592 --> 23:05.258
They're not too bad, but they look a bit ordinary, don't they?

23:05.298 --> 23:06.560
What do we call this one?

23:06.600 --> 23:07.882
This is called the Spendiment.

23:07.902 --> 23:08.903
I'll give you a bit of paper.

23:10.305 --> 23:10.686
Right.

23:10.987 --> 23:12.690
And what was this originally used for?

23:12.810 --> 23:14.452
It was used for this sort of thing, yes.

23:14.573 --> 23:23.006
As you can see, it's been restored in the 70s, in the mid-1970s, when these bookcases replaced some other ones, and the floor levels were changed.

23:23.927 --> 23:30.037
But we're beneath the dormitory now, and we'll be looking at that anyway in a while.

23:31.079 --> 23:37.669
So, right, let's go upstairs into the library, somewhere in between.

23:41.800 --> 24:04.626
Do you want me to close the door?

24:04.646 --> 24:06.188
No, it's all right.

24:08.294 --> 24:35.280
Now when you're looking at these books don't go near them with any

24:35.648 --> 24:56.442
pens or anything and don't let your tie run all over it and don't rub your hands or put your fingers on any writing or any paint but when you turn over the pages just turn them over by the extreme edge

24:56.708 --> 24:58.631
So, just like that.

24:59.953 --> 25:02.416
It's all on casting.

25:02.837 --> 25:08.225
There's something about the library for you all.

25:09.827 --> 25:17.839
This tells you how to make ink and the various processes that are involved in making a page.

25:18.072 --> 25:27.405
this character about what goes towards making up the different colours that you get in these books.

25:28.186 --> 25:36.357
Now, the earliest one that we've got here is an 8th century gospel book, and it's quite interesting.

25:36.457 --> 25:46.290
It's got varying hands indicating that different people have been involved in the creation of it.

25:47.215 --> 25:53.004
It's in what's called an unsteal script, which is a clear, square script.

25:53.084 --> 26:02.858
You can understand the alphabet quite easily, even if your knowledge of Latin may not be the most wonderful.

26:03.239 --> 26:08.306
The vellum, as you can see, changes in quality throughout.

26:09.809 --> 26:16.699
It's a matter of different animals and a matter of different processes of making it.

26:16.966 --> 26:26.897
Anglo-Saxon felon, or skim, in these sorts of books, have to be very stiff and hard.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.699
Hi, can I help you?

26:28.719 --> 26:32.704
Do I better just go and see what's happening?

26:32.724 --> 26:35.807
I don't know, I'll look back here again.

26:35.827 --> 26:45.758
There you go.

26:46.447 --> 27:11.830
In two columns, the ruling is done blind,

27:12.147 --> 27:35.421
a blunt instrument which rules on the page and creates a frame within which the text goes and then you can see at the end obviously somebody else has done it it might have been that they didn't really finish it or it might have been that the end became missing and they had to

27:35.755 --> 27:37.417
Re-complete it.

27:37.597 --> 27:39.319
And that's decidedly two different hands.

27:39.339 --> 27:40.780
Oh, totally.

27:40.800 --> 27:41.080
Yes, yes.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.322
Different style.

27:42.342 --> 27:44.284
It's difficult to know, actually, whether it's a different hand.

27:44.304 --> 27:47.607
It might be a different style, but my guess is it's a different hand.

27:48.207 --> 27:49.749
It looks like that, doesn't it?

27:49.769 --> 27:53.072
And there's a nice... Is that a wormhole?

27:53.993 --> 27:54.814
Well, not worms.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.416
No, you don't get worms in the vellum.

27:56.436 --> 28:00.300
But what you get is injuries in the animal.

28:01.321 --> 28:05.745
And so when the skin is stretched, then...

28:06.417 --> 28:12.085
They're all imperfections which are within our bodies, you know, basking or stretched.

28:12.525 --> 28:21.277
We would have lots of cuts, wouldn't we, and wounds within ourselves, and they become holes when the vellum is stretched.

28:21.317 --> 28:23.380
And the evitations are in what language?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.902
It's all in Latin, yeah.

28:25.763 --> 28:34.855
This one is a late 11th century onwards historical miscellany, and it's

28:35.088 --> 28:36.210
Again, it's very interesting.

28:36.230 --> 28:38.012
What you see here, this is one book.

28:38.032 --> 28:40.856
This is a history called Brute.

28:42.037 --> 28:44.240
And it's quite late.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.503
It's a 14th century tract.

28:46.904 --> 28:48.867
But it's only that big.

28:48.887 --> 29:00.763
Then you have the history of the English church and people by the Venerable Bede here, and something by Gilbert of Limerick at the beginning as well.

29:01.584 --> 29:03.306
And that's not very big either.

29:04.349 --> 29:09.193
But that's a 12th century copy of the Ecclesiastical history.

29:10.475 --> 29:24.707
And then after that, you've got a 12th century rather informal little document, only about five or six pages long, or perhaps a little bit longer than that.

29:24.727 --> 29:26.089
Here we are, start here.

29:26.109 --> 29:31.714
It's a genealogy taking a bit from Adam to Woden around to Henry II.

29:32.274 --> 29:33.175
And that's not really...

29:33.391 --> 29:39.717
So all these little books have been bound together in the Middle Ages and then rebound in the 19th century.

29:39.918 --> 29:49.147
And then at the end, there's this thing by a man called Martinus Polonus.

29:50.909 --> 29:52.310
You see his name then, Martinus.

29:54.733 --> 29:58.156
And it tells it here, it's from the convent library of the monks of Durham.

29:58.937 --> 30:01.980
And so at some stage this was bound up separately in its own little...

30:02.770 --> 30:29.335
uh cover so this was prepared here at last no not necessarily no not sure it was probably brought in and it's a quite interesting document it takes you through history so this is the year 1050 the year 1050 the year uh like i've been no it's not 1000 1400 i guess like that can't possibly be right but uh um

30:31.357 --> 30:37.586
What it does, it takes us through the Popes, Pontificates, and the Emperors.

30:38.146 --> 30:42.993
So, on one page you've got Popes, on the other side you've got Emperors, the Holy Roman Emperor.

30:43.013 --> 30:48.661
So you've got Theodosius, Barnus there, and then who we've got there?

30:48.681 --> 30:49.802
And who we've got here?

30:49.822 --> 30:51.965
How would you refer collectively to this volume?

30:52.166 --> 30:53.768
It's called the Chronicus.

30:53.968 --> 30:55.370
It's called Chronica.

30:55.390 --> 30:58.094
Chronica of Martinus Peronus.

30:59.816 --> 31:00.537
And...

31:01.833 --> 31:24.972
yes pope sixtus there felix so uh but for us of course the most interesting thing is is the ecclesiastical history of the venerable being uh it's a very late copy the earliest copies of this most important work are in cambridge and in st petersburg and um

31:25.272 --> 31:37.513
The Venable B had a very wide circulation, his works were internationally known, and so it probably wasn't very important for Darwin to have an early copy anyway, but it would have been nice to have one.

31:37.593 --> 31:39.195
But other places had them instead.

31:40.478 --> 31:43.142
But how much earlier are these others?

31:43.202 --> 31:45.706
The Venable B in the 8th century.

31:45.726 --> 31:48.551
So B is from the 8th century?

31:48.571 --> 31:50.875
In the 8th century, 1737 and Darwin.

31:53.707 --> 32:17.858
Now this is a 12th century one and so you just see a bit of a progression from Anglo-Saxon to 11th century, 12th century, much more gothic appearance and this is a commentary on the epistles of St Paul by Peter Lombard with the text of the epistle and then the Peter Lombard's commentary round about it and there's ruling in black there.

32:18.361 --> 32:20.183
A different sort of venom already, isn't it?

32:20.203 --> 32:24.248
You can see how it's becoming much easier to use.

32:26.170 --> 32:35.041
And then at the beginning of each of these epistles, or the commentaries on each epistle, you can see there the little print marks at the edge where the page is rolled across.

32:36.623 --> 32:42.630
At the beginning of each epistle there's a sometimes a nice initial sort of thing.

32:43.117 --> 32:45.520
So, anyway, there are three books for you to look at.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.425
Do be extremely careful, please, with them.

32:48.825 --> 32:57.738
You can see the whole purpose of the plan of the page is to enable you to understand the beauty of the thing.

32:59.260 --> 33:06.050
And if it was a scholarly text that needed annotations, you could also make annotations within this margin.

33:07.632 --> 33:11.217
But you have lots of white around the page which sets it off.

33:11.365 --> 33:14.469
as all good printers do, let alone manuscript writers.

33:15.150 --> 33:19.515
But it also enables you to be careful to just pick the page up.

33:19.595 --> 33:21.597
I have a question that presents something of a paragraph.

33:21.758 --> 33:27.865
You said earlier when we were in there that these books were prepared strictly for the nasty community.

33:28.105 --> 33:29.207
So that's why they weren't changed.

33:30.508 --> 33:33.972
Who were these magnificent illuminations made for?

33:33.992 --> 33:35.314
Well they were made from art.

33:38.973 --> 33:41.139
That was part of their offering.

33:42.122 --> 33:53.775
They offered their lives in prayer and chastity and obedience and having made that terrific sacrifice obviously they wanted to make the very best

33:53.857 --> 33:55.139
of whatever they did.

33:55.239 --> 33:58.946
I think that would have been a motivation with some, obviously.

33:58.966 --> 34:05.077
And those who were good artists, who were found to be good artists, would regard that as their offering.

34:05.858 --> 34:10.988
And I dare say he would gain very great facility in doing it.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.432
So these were not made for human eyes?

34:13.652 --> 34:14.273
Of course they were.

34:14.374 --> 34:14.734
Oh yes.

34:14.834 --> 34:15.255
They were.

34:15.536 --> 34:16.978
Oh yes, of course.

34:16.998 --> 34:17.940
But there was this kind of

34:18.747 --> 34:21.470
No, they were practical things.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.492
They wouldn't make books if they weren't going to use them.

34:23.672 --> 34:23.893
No.

34:25.515 --> 34:28.378
But they wanted them to be beautiful as well.

34:28.738 --> 34:39.050
As every craftsman, every producer of anything wants it to be praiseworthy, don't they?

34:40.011 --> 34:47.539
You know, the most modest printer wouldn't want to present you with a production of which he wasn't proud.

34:48.059 --> 34:51.722
And we're looking at an illumination that's... how old?

34:51.742 --> 34:52.983
I'm sorry, that's 12th century.

34:53.003 --> 34:57.367
Yeah, so that's about 1160, 1170, that's right.

34:58.288 --> 35:00.410
This looks like it could have been done in five years.

35:00.510 --> 35:02.432
It's very good, isn't it?

35:02.492 --> 35:02.772
Yes.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.234
Things shouldn't deteriorate.

35:04.374 --> 35:05.114
We can.

35:06.035 --> 35:09.078
The outer materials that they use seem to last forever.

35:09.799 --> 35:14.903
This is gold, this must be... Perhaps it's last July, I don't know.

35:14.923 --> 35:16.885
It's difficult to tell others, yeah.

35:17.067 --> 35:25.716
I mean, I guess I would have done that for us today, wouldn't I?

35:25.736 --> 35:25.936
Wonderful.

35:25.956 --> 35:30.961
Really, can't it?

35:30.981 --> 35:37.028
I don't want to take a little bit of advice, and I can't even use that.

35:37.048 --> 35:37.668
No, I wish I would.

35:37.688 --> 35:38.009
Okay, so, today.

35:38.029 --> 35:38.509
Would you like to start?

35:38.529 --> 35:38.669
Mm-hmm.

35:38.689 --> 35:39.290
Would you like to start?

35:39.470 --> 35:39.610
Mm-hmm.

35:39.750 --> 35:40.832
Would you like to start?

35:40.852 --> 35:41.512
All right, that's great.

35:41.532 --> 35:43.334
Yes, excellent.

35:43.354 --> 35:44.155
Wonderful.

35:44.557 --> 36:03.156
The English scribes and Scots and Welsh and Irish don't seem to tell us what they are.

36:03.288 --> 36:16.642
Now in Europe they do, they're much more likely to say who has written the work at the end and say what the weather's been like and how their hands are cold and all that sort of stuff.

36:16.662 --> 36:23.749
Our people don't seem to be very concerned to say oh I did this and that of course is part of their humility isn't it?

36:24.550 --> 36:31.017
Now when you get later on in the middle ages it's much more common of course for lay people to indicate

36:31.165 --> 36:37.354
where the work is being done, particularly near Montelis being done and that sort of thing.

36:37.374 --> 36:45.427
Do we have a sense as to where this is?

36:45.947 --> 36:55.502
The 11th century work and that historical work, the first one would probably be done in Jarrah or Wienland or something like that.

36:55.735 --> 36:58.982
So it's fair to assume that this book has been here?

36:59.363 --> 37:06.217
Oh, no, over 40 years.

37:06.237 --> 37:12.951
Well, and there are a few numbers of these books around here.

37:13.876 --> 37:20.345
And wouldn't it be interesting to know who's read the book?

37:20.365 --> 37:20.825
I suppose so.

37:22.247 --> 37:27.715
What would we determine by?

37:28.115 --> 37:29.016
There must be sample.

37:29.036 --> 37:31.039
Oh, we can't know.

37:31.059 --> 37:31.640
I hope so.

37:32.121 --> 37:35.285
Otherwise we'll never get it finished.

37:35.665 --> 37:38.790
Would you want to sit down and enjoy them?

37:39.130 --> 37:42.094
I'm reluctant to handle them.

37:42.243 --> 37:45.786
Shall we go through into the dorm room quickly and have a quick look in there?

37:46.247 --> 37:52.212
Sorry, you were going to ask something.

37:52.612 --> 37:54.074
It's quite old, yes.

37:54.114 --> 37:55.155
It's quite a date.

37:55.175 --> 37:56.236
1745, there you are.

37:56.716 --> 37:58.538
What was his name?

37:58.718 --> 38:00.740
In the back of Calabon, or was it?

38:00.760 --> 38:01.340
1745.

38:02.682 --> 38:05.684
And so this is Darren and Lucia.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.286
When did you arrive?

38:07.586 --> 38:09.668
When did you arrive at Durham?

38:10.002 --> 38:14.446
You've not been here before?

38:15.047 --> 38:23.915
So really, the topography of the city is quite interesting because it's very fortress-like, as you can see, there's an incident.

38:24.835 --> 38:25.776
Yeah, yeah.

38:26.217 --> 38:28.239
Lots of hills, yes.

38:28.359 --> 38:30.020
You came by plane, did you?

38:30.140 --> 38:30.941
Yeah.

38:32.923 --> 38:37.647
Yes, well of course York, as you come to the Vale of York, you think, oh my goodness, this is quite...

38:37.627 --> 39:00.698
uninteresting land sometimes because you always show it as wonderful but the plane with a very flat plane between you so do you want to go then yeah thank you thank you very much thank you

39:01.387 --> 39:03.713
This is worth the whole trip to England.

39:03.733 --> 39:04.034
Great.

39:05.237 --> 39:07.744
Okay, so moving on.

39:08.666 --> 39:11.293
Do you want me to take a picture of the two together?

39:11.875 --> 39:14.602
Oh, no, no, that's okay.

39:14.842 --> 39:15.324
Thank you.

39:15.845 --> 39:16.948
Thank you very much.

39:18.211 --> 39:40.419
And the picture up there shows that at the end of the 17th century, when those western towers on the running outside, fine, I had spires on, which don't survive enough, but there are... Isn't it interesting?

39:41.140 --> 39:42.702
That makes all the difference, doesn't it?

39:42.722 --> 39:45.265
You know, that's what holidays are all about, because

39:46.004 --> 39:53.232
You think of the holidays that you've had, and what's memorable about those holidays is the things that have taken you by surprise, isn't it?

39:53.673 --> 39:59.879
And when you've seen something you didn't expect to see... Well, my goodness, why not?

40:00.340 --> 40:03.924
What a thrill at their age.

40:03.944 --> 40:05.566
I'm a jolly pleased to meet them.

40:07.047 --> 40:07.708
It's great.

40:07.948 --> 40:15.657
And I also feel about that sort of situation is that these things are for everyone.

40:15.940 --> 40:21.105
And you really mustn't be too protective about them.

40:22.226 --> 40:23.307
Well, but it's hard though.

40:23.627 --> 40:25.169
It's hard, yeah, it's got to be sensible.

40:25.229 --> 40:31.415
But at the same time, everyone should be entitled to be inspired a little bit every now and again.

40:31.575 --> 40:33.537
I'm so happy for them.

40:33.657 --> 40:35.839
They have the curiosity to want to see these.

40:35.859 --> 40:36.680
Yeah, absolutely.

40:36.700 --> 40:41.684
This room is the dormitory, and we're celebrating this year our 600th anniversary of this roof.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.547
It's a 1398 roof.

40:46.231 --> 40:47.853
You can see where we are.

40:47.893 --> 40:50.577
We're at the far end of the church.

40:50.597 --> 40:52.900
We're at the west end of the church on the south wall.

40:53.401 --> 41:01.713
And so this whole cloister, this room is nearly 200 feet long, is the west cloister of the cathedral.

41:02.073 --> 41:08.783
And we're overlooking the River Weir, which is down in the deep fire, down the precipice, outside those windows to our left.

41:10.325 --> 41:15.833
And so taking that there would have varying stages of the life of this church,

41:16.083 --> 41:22.270
monastic house which was founded in 1083 between about 70 and say 120, 150 brethren.

41:22.310 --> 41:33.844
And taking into account that not all of those people would be sleeping here at once because Durham, as I've said, its own college in Oxford where novices would be.

41:34.625 --> 41:44.436
They had rest homes at Finkel, at Bear Park, at Coldingham, at Stamford, London, lots of different places, Jarrow, Wearmouth, Lindisfarne.

41:44.855 --> 42:13.275
and then they would be dispersed throughout those houses during the year at different seasons and so probably 20 to 50 to 60 people might sleep in this room at any one time and typically of great monastic buildings it's lofty so the air is always beautifully fresh and it provides light from the upper casements from the upper windows in the same way that the refectory that we went into first

42:14.099 --> 42:43.313
does as well so the the light comes in from above but it doesn't distract you because you know you can't you can't well there are certain windows to look out of i suppose but there's not much distraction in the refectory anyway for them to look out at during their meals so we think that within these alcoves that we can see all along both walls of this long dormitory room within each alcove there would have been

42:43.478 --> 42:52.666
a little compartment where a brother or maybe two brethren, if they put a partition up, would sleep.

42:52.686 --> 42:55.549
They wouldn't have any major properties of their own.

42:55.949 --> 42:57.971
They might have their little cupboards beside them.

42:58.672 --> 43:03.236
But of course it was poverty, chastity and obedience.

43:03.376 --> 43:04.317
What was it in that order?

43:04.337 --> 43:05.898
It was a Benedictine order.

43:06.178 --> 43:08.320
Originally when the community of St.

43:08.340 --> 43:11.844
Cuthbert came here in 995 with the body of St.

43:11.884 --> 43:12.304
Cuthbert,

43:12.520 --> 43:20.813
which is around which this whole church is built, then it was a non-monastic community.

43:20.833 --> 43:24.640
It was a community of seculars, of priests, of laymen probably as well.

43:25.601 --> 43:27.544
Then in 1083, William of St.

43:27.584 --> 43:30.489
Calais changed that community of St.

43:30.509 --> 43:39.844
Cuthbert, the guardians of the shrine, into a regular Benedictine order in the fashion of a great many others in this country.

43:40.482 --> 43:43.405
And it continued to be that until the dissolution of the monastery.

43:46.128 --> 43:48.031
So if you want to have a wander around, it's a nice room.

43:48.311 --> 43:51.414
It's partly a public museum and partly a working library.

43:52.295 --> 44:00.525
We said at an early stage that this room has modern books in relating to history, theology, monasticism, all sorts of things.

44:01.606 --> 44:05.270
And we try and keep that collection up.

44:05.330 --> 44:09.595
You mentioned that after the dissolution, the Catholic Church,

44:09.946 --> 44:15.954
There was a rather seamless, not necessarily seamless, but an orderly transition.

44:16.054 --> 44:17.876
Very, yes, you're absolutely right.

44:18.196 --> 44:18.957
Yeah.

44:19.218 --> 44:20.099
The Anglican Church?

44:20.419 --> 44:20.840
Yep.

44:20.860 --> 44:23.263
And is that still the governing body?

44:23.283 --> 44:23.363
Yes.

44:23.443 --> 44:24.084
Oh, yes, yes.

44:24.384 --> 44:34.517
This church was originally, in the Middle Ages, the dedication was to St Mary and St Cuthbert.

44:34.537 --> 44:36.780
And then at the dissolution, it became...

44:37.132 --> 44:39.955
dedicated to Christ and Blessed Mary the Virgin.

44:40.515 --> 44:41.736
And so they made a change.

44:41.776 --> 44:43.858
It is what is called a new foundation.

44:44.379 --> 44:55.650
And, funnily enough, the new foundations of cathedrals in this country are, in fact, usually the older of them, because they've all been, as it were, re-founded in 1540.

44:58.893 --> 45:04.118
But they were originally founded, say ours was originally founded in 1995, and

45:04.739 --> 45:08.083
We're celebrating a huge anniversary this last year of St.

45:08.123 --> 45:17.795
Augustine, which would have been, what, 1,300 years ago, or 1,400 years ago, yes, 1,400 years ago, 597 when St.

45:17.915 --> 45:26.325
Augustine came to this country to be Archbishop of Canterbury.

45:26.345 --> 45:26.425
Wow.

45:26.445 --> 45:29.068
But we are celebrating 600 years of this roof this year.

45:29.709 --> 45:33.654
I'm not quite sure how we're going to do it, but we're having a party, I think.

45:33.674 --> 45:34.695
Those themes are...

45:35.333 --> 45:37.215
They're from local woods, I suppose, yeah.

45:37.235 --> 45:45.062
We're not quite sure where they came from, but probably from the Pryor's summer residence at Bear Park, which is quite near.

45:45.082 --> 45:45.842
What kind of wood?

45:45.862 --> 45:49.045
They are oak, yeah.

45:49.065 --> 45:54.630
You wouldn't get root of this sort in anything other than oak at that stage, I think.

45:54.650 --> 45:57.613
Those joiners or all the original joiners?

45:57.693 --> 45:59.054
It's relatively unspoiled.

45:59.074 --> 46:04.699
The only thing that's happened to it is that you've had an addition of these decorative

46:05.000 --> 46:33.083
pieces which are non-structural to about halfway down the dormitory in the 18th century but otherwise it's still the very austere looking roof isn't it it's very plain, massive, terrifically strong from the 14th century so I'll just leave you to have a wander around and then when you talk about

46:33.383 --> 46:37.329
to each other about things, and then maybe you'll have one or two things that you want to ask me again.

46:37.349 --> 46:48.627
I think probably in the Middle Ages we wouldn't have had a window as big as that.

46:48.647 --> 46:49.609
That has definitely been changed.

46:49.629 --> 46:51.252
I get the impression it would have been much smaller.

46:51.732 --> 47:00.927
Indeed, to have such a large window would have made it extremely difficult to sleep, wouldn't it?

47:01.193 --> 47:19.590
It's two hours and 15 minutes, they said.

47:19.710 --> 47:21.772
What did you call this book once more?

47:21.792 --> 47:26.496
This is a commentary on the epistles of St Paul.

47:26.756 --> 47:30.660
It's a 12th century manuscript which shows the epistles

47:30.944 --> 47:34.449
with illuminated letter P's at the beginning of each epistle.

47:34.970 --> 47:46.847
And surrounding the text of each epistle you've got the commentary of Peter Lombard, one of the great commentators of the early Middle Ages.

47:47.668 --> 47:50.372
And how many illuminations are there like this?

47:50.512 --> 47:52.075
There's about six.

47:53.297 --> 47:55.920
It shows a little bit of sense of humour there.

47:55.940 --> 47:59.145
You've got somebody having his nose pecked by one of these cross-century animals.

47:59.547 --> 48:08.138
You've got a background of gold, which is gold leaf based on gesso, a sort of chalk base, so that it stands slightly further of the page.

48:08.158 --> 48:14.806
You've got very strong colours compared with what we've got here on the right-hand side in the 12th century, in the 11th century.

48:14.886 --> 48:18.491
The 11th century colours are quite pastel shades, aren't they?

48:19.072 --> 48:24.999
In comparison with these really strong colours, strong black ink as well, aren't they?

48:25.019 --> 48:27.342
It almost looks like graphic tape, doesn't it?

48:27.362 --> 48:28.744
No, it's fairly gothic-y, isn't it?

48:29.112 --> 48:31.535
This is still pretty readable, isn't it?

48:31.555 --> 48:34.819
You can identify all the letter forms there without any problems.

48:34.839 --> 48:37.922
But when we get to this, they're beginning to be inconsiderate.

48:38.003 --> 48:41.527
They're squeezing the writing up into a Gothic form.

48:41.887 --> 48:48.976
They're using lots and lots of abbreviations, assuming that you've got a good knowledge of Latin.

48:49.176 --> 48:54.282
A lot of people did have who would need to read these books.

48:56.585 --> 48:57.786
But nonetheless, it is...

48:58.728 --> 49:01.311
It's getting a little more careless, isn't it?

49:01.391 --> 49:09.201
It's less beautiful to look at than, say, the early part of the book, or it's certainly less beautiful to look at than the 11th century one then.

49:11.183 --> 49:11.683
It's wonderful.

49:11.964 --> 49:12.705
Look at the gold.

49:12.725 --> 49:17.530
It's such a good order, isn't it?

49:17.551 --> 49:20.154
But they did have a sense for the book arts, didn't they?

49:21.455 --> 49:27.182
It's a work of art in its own... Well, I could talk all day.
