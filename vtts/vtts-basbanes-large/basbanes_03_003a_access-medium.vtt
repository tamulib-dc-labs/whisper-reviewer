00:02.900 --> 00:06.144
This is Gaddis Smith, and it's June 30, 2005.

00:06.244 --> 00:06.525
Okay.

00:06.545 --> 00:08.707
And you don't even have to worry about it.

00:08.727 --> 00:10.309
It's just there.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.452
Well, I'm very Yale.

00:12.792 --> 00:17.178
I graduated from Yale College in 1954 and did my Ph.D.

00:17.478 --> 00:24.207
here in history, taught only three years at Duke, and then was back in 1961 on the faculty.

00:24.347 --> 00:29.093
And I officially retired in 2000, but I'm still pretty busy.

00:29.545 --> 00:37.336
mainly with a big book, which is overdue, which is called Yale and the External World, the Shaping of the University in the 20th Century.

00:37.356 --> 00:39.679
I heard a cute story when I was arranging about it.

00:39.699 --> 00:42.403
I said, Jens, did you get me a copy of Yale?

00:42.423 --> 00:50.634
Oh, yeah, because people have been... That book was getting publicity about five years ago.

00:50.654 --> 00:51.735
Here's the article for 99.

00:51.855 --> 00:53.498
Oh, gosh, yeah.

00:53.578 --> 00:54.439
Well...

00:55.313 --> 00:57.815
So I'm still working on that.

00:58.276 --> 01:09.025
It's nearly finished, but it's just very enormous because the emphasis is on how Yale was shaped by external developments, changes in American society, war and peace, and all of that.

01:09.306 --> 01:11.388
And you don't have to worry about that.

01:11.508 --> 01:11.888
Okay.

01:12.649 --> 01:24.139
So the focus of the big book is sort of on the core institution, on the education, on the faculty, the students, the leadership of the university.

01:24.159 --> 01:25.000
So I have not

01:25.452 --> 01:29.819
actually looked into, in terms of archival research, the Yale Press.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.946
But I, of course, have been an observer of the Yale Press.

01:33.966 --> 01:38.574
I was on the Publications Committee in the 1990s for about four or five years.

01:40.276 --> 01:45.164
And my first book was a Yale Press book in 1965.

01:45.365 --> 01:50.413
And I'd known a good many of the

01:51.035 --> 01:54.018
key people at the Yale Press over the years.

01:54.098 --> 02:01.807
Well, 1965, that's 40 years ago since I graduated from college.

02:01.827 --> 02:07.614
But you've been around Yale for fully half of the life of the press.

02:08.415 --> 02:14.602
Yeah, and of the years since, I mean, my book, his big book, starts in 1900.

02:15.222 --> 02:20.248
So I've been around for more than half the time.

02:21.089 --> 02:35.104
So there are certain moments when the Yale Press got a lot of attention and maybe notoriety that you will probably pick up, but I could list the ones that occurred to me.

02:35.164 --> 02:37.066
I'd be interested in the attention and the notoriety.

02:37.106 --> 02:37.827
Okay.

02:40.230 --> 02:48.058
One of the editors, I think he was still called the editors, or directors, was Eugene Davidson.

02:48.595 --> 02:55.103
I don't know his exact years, but probably late 30s into the early 50s.

02:55.964 --> 03:02.552
And he was quite an isolationist before Pearl Harbor.

03:03.633 --> 03:17.910
And two books that Yale Press published that did get an awful lot of political attention and are still very controversial, as what they represented, were by Charles Beard.

03:18.869 --> 03:48.808
the um one was and they were they were bitter polemic attacks on fdr and yale public oh yeah they uh they were very polemical no questions about it uh and um so um one was uh i think called the roosevelt in the making of american foreign policy i mean i don't have the titles right but you can buy it i think um covered 1933 to 1940

03:49.953 --> 04:13.885
um saying he's taking us into war well that was war was coming and then the other one uh focused on 1941 and that one became was published i think in 46 and it was part of the even though beard himself was was a left-wing liberal for most of his life really

04:14.101 --> 04:15.022
Yeah.

04:15.943 --> 04:18.425
Was he associated with the university at all?

04:18.445 --> 04:18.965
Oh, no.

04:19.005 --> 04:27.233
He is among, he's perhaps the most political and prominent of American historians.

04:27.413 --> 04:28.274
No kidding.

04:28.414 --> 04:30.996
In the 20th century, although he died, I think, in 1948.

04:32.037 --> 04:40.425
And his, the book that got him fame, Yale didn't publish, press it barely begun.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.066
It was called The Economic

04:42.502 --> 04:56.143
origins of the Constitution, which argued that the Constitution was not handed down by God, but was created by selfish economic interests who were out to improve their own fortunes.

04:56.884 --> 05:03.835
And then during the First World War, then he was professor at Columbia.

05:04.756 --> 05:10.585
And during the First World War, he was a critic of American entry into the First World War.

05:11.476 --> 05:23.328
And when the president of Columbia fired two tenured faculty members for criticizing the government of the United States, Beard resigned, a professorship at Columbia.

05:24.929 --> 05:26.851
But he was a prolific writer.

05:27.792 --> 05:31.496
And he and his wife, Mary Beard, were really famous figures.

05:31.816 --> 05:38.563
And then I think, from my point of view, he really went over the top with these extreme attacks on Roosevelt.

05:38.923 --> 05:40.485
Why were they published by Yale, do you think?

05:40.505 --> 05:41.466
Well, Eugene Davidson.

05:41.648 --> 05:44.232
I think, who shared those views.

05:45.714 --> 06:04.062
I think that's the one time that Yale Press, in my opinion, really stepped out of bounds, if bounds are defined as keeping yourself focused on scholarship and not getting involved directly in politics.

06:04.227 --> 06:06.770
scholarly books that certainly have a political objective.

06:07.130 --> 06:08.712
And have a point of view, of course.

06:08.732 --> 06:09.833
Yeah, sure, of course.

06:09.853 --> 06:11.515
But as you said, these are polemical things.

06:11.695 --> 06:12.215
Yeah, yeah.

06:12.275 --> 06:16.580
So Eugene Davidson is someone to look at.

06:16.620 --> 06:23.607
And I guess you've got the director's files and all these things.

06:23.627 --> 06:25.349
They're giving me free, it's really kind of fun.

06:25.409 --> 06:26.771
I'm looking forward to it, you know.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.775
Another issue

06:31.295 --> 06:36.421
which is still somewhat alive, and it's quite different, is the Vinland map.

06:37.402 --> 06:38.604
Do you know about the Vinland map?

06:38.624 --> 06:40.066
Yeah, I'd love to hear you tell me about it.

06:40.246 --> 06:43.189
All right.

06:43.350 --> 06:46.714
There are still schools that claim it's authentic, right?

06:46.734 --> 06:47.054
Yeah.

06:47.314 --> 06:52.421
Yeah, and I'm puzzled myself as to whether it was or not.

06:52.441 --> 06:54.263
I just come back from Iceland, actually, so.

06:56.846 --> 06:58.568
I got back on Saturday, so...

06:59.425 --> 07:03.749
And this was very much in my mind because of the Viking explorations.

07:04.610 --> 07:14.059
And I'm beginning to think it may have been authentic, but what Yale Press did, and I guess Chester Kerr was the head at that point.

07:14.639 --> 07:15.940
This is 1965.

07:17.762 --> 07:20.024
First, this manuscript turned up.

07:21.766 --> 07:26.310
It's a little mysterious as to exactly how it turned up, but it was found

07:26.577 --> 07:30.241
interleaved, interbound, in a medieval manuscript.

07:31.822 --> 07:38.229
And for a long time, the purchaser of it, on behalf of Yale, was secret, but it was Paul Mellon.

07:39.170 --> 07:42.533
That was revealed after Paul Mellon's death.

07:42.813 --> 07:44.315
Was it after his death that it finally came out?

07:44.335 --> 07:45.576
It didn't come out until after his death.

07:45.596 --> 07:45.876
Oh, well.

07:46.677 --> 07:48.299
Because, I mean, he was so generous to Yale.

07:48.319 --> 07:52.443
Oh, yeah, and he paid half a million dollars for it, which is a hell of a lot of money, even then.

07:52.543 --> 07:54.405
The jump change for Yale.

07:54.465 --> 07:56.567
Yeah, for him.

07:58.302 --> 08:09.553
A guy named Alex Vitor, who was curator of maps, married to a very wealthy woman, who's still alive, and who has taken a great interest in this.

08:10.013 --> 08:13.076
She's a DuPont, Mrs. Vitor.

08:15.478 --> 08:17.080
So, Yale brought it out.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.422
They didn't consult scholars.

08:21.063 --> 08:25.187
So, the Yale faculty was very upset.

08:26.609 --> 08:28.090
Samuel Elliott Morrison,

08:28.964 --> 08:32.908
great Harvard historian of maritime affairs, among many other things.

08:33.829 --> 08:35.751
He was furious about it.

08:35.771 --> 08:39.514
The greatest selling author in the history of the Oxford University Press, I think, in fact.

08:39.654 --> 08:39.975
Could be.

08:40.015 --> 08:40.595
They said it.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.677
Yeah, I read that.

08:42.697 --> 08:46.521
I went to school, high school, reading Morrison and Commentary.

08:46.561 --> 08:49.043
The statue of Cromwell Avenue in Boston outside of St.

08:49.204 --> 08:49.324
Louis.

08:49.364 --> 08:50.225
Yeah, great statue.

08:50.265 --> 08:51.306
I love that statue.

08:51.326 --> 08:55.049
Looking out to sea and all of that.

08:55.309 --> 08:57.992
And then

08:58.343 --> 09:02.408
The Yale Press brought it out and announced it.

09:02.428 --> 09:03.710
There was no previous announcement.

09:04.431 --> 09:08.616
So the publication day was October 12, 1965.

09:09.237 --> 09:20.792
New Haven has, at least then, had reputed to have the highest percentage of people of Italian origin of any city outside of Italy.

09:20.832 --> 09:21.192
Really?

09:21.212 --> 09:22.214
Yeah.

09:22.234 --> 09:25.718
The mayor was, most of our mayors have been Italian.

09:25.917 --> 09:37.569
And Worcester Street, and the pizza began here, and the World Headquarters of the Knights of Columbus, the big skyscraper down there.

09:37.609 --> 09:39.311
That's the World Headquarters of the Knights of Columbus.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.814
I didn't know that.

09:42.474 --> 09:42.574
Yeah.

09:42.594 --> 09:42.935
So, oh, boy.

09:43.095 --> 09:45.457
The local people were pretty angry.

09:46.018 --> 09:53.646
And Chester Kerr said, oh, it was just a coincidence that we brought all bullshit.

09:53.997 --> 09:58.521
You know, the scholarly attacks developed, and again, you probably know the story.

09:59.822 --> 10:09.070
What appeared to be definitive proof of its inauthenticity was a chemical test of the ink.

10:10.111 --> 10:17.358
And so these sort of forensic chemists said this was artificial synthetic chemical, which was developed in the 1920s.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.962
And so it must have been forged.

10:22.735 --> 10:25.319
from the 1920s or since.

10:25.479 --> 10:26.961
Pretty good job, though.

10:27.282 --> 10:39.180
Yeah, and then the thing kind of roiled along, and it appeared that the case was over.

10:39.681 --> 10:47.713
But then some other chemists came in, and this was just about maybe 10 years ago, and said, on the contrary, what these first chemists didn't do

10:48.402 --> 10:54.347
was to examine the ink of other unquestionably authentic contemporary manuscripts.

10:55.588 --> 11:05.477
And when that was done, they found the traces of this chemical, which in fact wasn't, maybe it had been synthesized, but it was a chemical that existed in nature.

11:06.197 --> 11:08.499
So the chemical test was invalidated.

11:09.180 --> 11:17.447
And then Yale Press brought out another edition of it about five years ago with a good introduction

11:17.765 --> 11:20.989
an explanation of the whole story.

11:21.069 --> 11:23.172
Well, because now it's a class celeb.

11:23.192 --> 11:26.096
Yeah, it was then, and still back and forth.

11:26.136 --> 11:46.202
My own view, because I do some maritime history, having spent these two weeks in Iceland and looking at some of their extraordinary museums there and materials, that it's pretty easy to explain knowledge.

11:46.722 --> 11:53.410
equal to what was outlined in that map.

11:53.450 --> 12:10.170
It's also said, and I haven't confirmed this anyway, I don't want to get too far away, that Christopher Columbus himself went to Iceland in preparation for proposing his trip, because the Vikings were the preeminent mariners.

12:10.611 --> 12:13.995
The only thing that's a little bit against that is that the Great Age of Iceland

12:14.633 --> 12:21.264
was to say the first 300 years from its first settlement in 950.

12:21.304 --> 12:24.669
And then, for a variety of reasons, it was declining.

12:24.709 --> 12:25.751
The climate was changing.

12:26.292 --> 12:28.455
The Greenland settlement collapsed.

12:29.136 --> 12:31.420
There's no question that they had a settlement in Newfoundland.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.284
I mean, that's fully confirmed by archaeologists.

12:35.046 --> 12:40.995
So by 1490, or whenever Columbus may have gone there,

12:42.022 --> 12:45.648
This was no longer necessarily the place to go to get information.

12:45.668 --> 12:46.089
But anyway.

12:46.429 --> 12:56.406
But that was... Even if something's in eclipse or decline, you can still pick up a few... And of course, the Icelanders were already renowned for writing everything down.

12:56.426 --> 12:57.648
And maybe there were some good charts.

12:57.668 --> 13:00.192
You had charts and sagas and everything.

13:01.034 --> 13:03.017
Most of which are...

13:03.335 --> 13:05.679
preserved in their originals in these museums.

13:05.699 --> 13:09.526
I wrote a little bit in my last book about the Icelandic saga.

13:09.826 --> 13:16.998
That's a great example of cultural repatriation, where the sagas will return to Iceland.

13:17.299 --> 13:17.539
Oh, yeah.

13:17.559 --> 13:18.561
It's an extraordinary country.

13:18.621 --> 13:20.064
What was your book?

13:20.084 --> 13:24.191
That book was called The Splendor, A Splendor of Letters, The Permanence of Books.

13:24.311 --> 13:27.216
It was published two years ago by Harper's.

13:27.702 --> 13:32.030
They have a museum which is basically devoted to the literary.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.512
The Marty Magnuson Museum.

13:33.692 --> 13:33.993
Yeah.

13:34.674 --> 13:36.578
Which was the same name.

13:36.618 --> 13:38.882
That was how they worked the details to get the stuff done.

13:38.942 --> 13:40.925
He's the guy who took them out.

13:40.965 --> 13:41.726
We had a guy.

13:41.747 --> 13:49.320
The main purpose of this trip was I went with a group led by a geologist, very distinguished geologist.

13:49.340 --> 13:50.622
And so we were basically looking at the

13:51.344 --> 13:52.486
the volcanoes and the glaciers.

13:52.506 --> 13:58.093
But we went all around the island, and we had a guy named Arnie Magnuson.

13:58.113 --> 13:58.994
Okay.

13:59.014 --> 14:00.035
It was wonderful.

14:00.076 --> 14:04.722
Oh, gosh, he was very learned, and he was just... So, anyway.

14:05.683 --> 14:11.991
So, those two books, or actually three books, since there were two by Charles Weir.

14:12.292 --> 14:18.600
Oh, and then, incidentally, Samuel L. Morrison was involved in both of these controversies, in a way.

14:19.930 --> 14:38.515
the Vinland map, but when Beard's second book came out, and it's after the Second World War, Beard was quite ill, but Morrison apparently didn't realize that, and wrote a scathing review called History Through a Beard.

14:38.536 --> 14:38.856
Wow.

14:39.577 --> 14:41.500
And then Beard died.

14:44.303 --> 14:46.847
So those are two episodes.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.110
So the criticism of the press

14:49.394 --> 14:54.180
And the first instance was basically that it was involving itself.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.406
That it was isolationist, and the director was isolationist and was, you know.

15:00.227 --> 15:03.631
Would that have happened if the press wasn't a private entity, do you think?

15:03.651 --> 15:05.754
Because it was not a division of the university.

15:05.934 --> 15:07.576
Yeah, yeah.

15:07.596 --> 15:18.810
Well, I think the, you know, as far as I can tell, once it became fully part of the university, the editors of the press had the

15:19.398 --> 15:28.908
the freedom to select the manuscripts that they're going to publish, and publish what they choose to publish.

15:30.670 --> 15:48.308
I like the idea that the press, I would have thought, and one thing that I learned very early on, and I'm just getting my feet wet, and we just started literally this week, is that one would assume that the University Press, one of its reasons to exist is to

15:48.592 --> 15:51.935
as to publish the creative work of faculty.

15:52.355 --> 15:52.876
Well, it was.

15:53.316 --> 15:57.079
Apparently, that's really not ever... Well, it was going on, certainly.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.684
But that doesn't necessarily give you a leg up in getting your stuff published here.

16:02.004 --> 16:02.444
Not now.

16:02.905 --> 16:03.605
Not now at all.

16:04.346 --> 16:06.588
But let me come back to that a little bit.

16:08.450 --> 16:18.058
You're mentioning that the press was not really, in most of the first half of its history, legally part of the university.

16:18.258 --> 16:23.004
And that's, I mean, that is interesting, and I don't know how that compares with other university presses.

16:23.805 --> 16:24.706
I'll find out.

16:25.007 --> 16:39.566
The George Parnelly Day, and indeed there's a large collection of George Parnelly Day papers over in historical manuscripts and archives in Sterling Library, because he was the treasurer of the university for about 30 years.

16:39.686 --> 16:41.628
And quite a remarkable man.

16:42.329 --> 16:46.054
So this was basically the creation of a

16:47.063 --> 16:50.908
a very energetic, young, at that point, businessman.

16:51.650 --> 17:00.442
The Yale Alumni Magazine, which was called the Alumni Weekly, was established a few years earlier in the 1890s.

17:00.482 --> 17:06.931
That also was a completely private, profit-making publication.

17:07.632 --> 17:11.558
And now, of course, it bears a relationship to the university.

17:11.578 --> 17:16.665
It was very similar to that of the press from a budgetary point of view.

17:16.966 --> 17:20.293
It's astonishing that the press actually operated in the black class here.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.417
Did it?

17:22.437 --> 17:23.199
It's amazing, isn't it?

17:23.219 --> 17:24.301
So they may be one of the few.

17:24.562 --> 17:27.448
Well, I can read all of these dismal articles.

17:27.468 --> 17:33.861
The Chronicle of Higher Education, and there was one recently, an academic publishing

17:34.533 --> 17:36.035
survive, sort of thing.

17:36.135 --> 17:38.818
And they publish, what, 300-something titles a year?

17:39.519 --> 17:40.340
Yeah, that's amazing.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.022
It is amazing, but the art books are exquisite.

17:42.042 --> 17:43.484
Yeah, yeah.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.325
They really are.

17:44.645 --> 17:50.032
And that was one of the things I wanted to emphasize, which you, of course, see.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.476
I don't know quite how that came about.

17:53.496 --> 17:55.037
I saw John Ryland the other day.

17:55.078 --> 17:58.281
He credits John Nichol in England.

17:58.942 --> 17:59.423
In London.

17:59.643 --> 18:00.324
Yeah.

18:00.344 --> 18:03.848
Because most of these books

18:04.165 --> 18:06.567
were basically developed in the London office.

18:07.969 --> 18:09.210
But it's not just the development there.

18:09.230 --> 18:17.479
I guess his business sense, I guess the... He would recruit the authors and... But, I mean, they were hemorrhaging money, apparently.

18:17.499 --> 18:21.943
And even Mellon, who was underwriting it to a degree, was becoming really upset.

18:22.544 --> 18:27.649
And they recruited this guy from Oxford, I guess it was, and just totally turned it around.

18:28.089 --> 18:30.612
Well, they're wonderful books, and I think... They're the best.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.198
Yeah, there's no question.

18:32.218 --> 18:33.039
That is bad.

18:33.059 --> 18:33.600
I see them.

18:33.620 --> 18:33.980
I review.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.702
I get books from publishers.

18:35.742 --> 18:40.987
Yeah, that really sets Yale Press apart, I think, from other universities.

18:41.007 --> 18:45.912
And now they do the Metropolitan Museum books, and they do the Artists of Chicago books.

18:45.932 --> 18:50.878
I don't know if they do the MFA in Boston books, but I mean, they have things with the British Library.

18:50.898 --> 18:52.399
It's amazing, and they're fabulous.

18:52.820 --> 18:58.185
And not only are they beautiful, the scholarship is excellent, yeah.

18:58.402 --> 19:04.588
Who ever thought that a university press would really become prominent in the publication of illustrated books?

19:04.608 --> 19:04.829
Yeah, yeah.

19:04.849 --> 19:07.271
It almost went counter to what university press would do.

19:07.291 --> 19:18.923
I don't know details about the production of those books, but there was a company, I think it still exists under this name, Meriden.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.685
Yeah, they're owned.

19:21.565 --> 19:22.827
I've seen their books.

19:23.187 --> 19:24.088
Meriden, whatever.

19:24.322 --> 19:30.268
But they do the illustrations for art catalogs and whatnot.

19:30.289 --> 19:32.591
Are they part of the press up in Vermont now?

19:32.611 --> 19:35.414
No, well, they're in Merritt and Connecticut, but they may be.

19:35.895 --> 19:41.541
At any rate, I think the Snyder Press took them over.

19:41.561 --> 19:52.793
Yeah, but I think a lot of the, I guess some of those books maybe, I don't know to what extent they were produced in England as opposed to produced here.

19:53.347 --> 19:56.671
But certainly the quality was enormous.

19:58.914 --> 20:14.454
Going back to another point, the university press as the vehicle for the publication of the work of faculty, that's been true of most university presses.

20:14.615 --> 20:21.143
And it was quite true of Yale in the early years of the press, when you had

20:21.410 --> 20:22.351
You had a departmental series.

20:22.371 --> 20:23.532
You had a history series.

20:23.552 --> 20:25.694
You had an English series and whatnot.

20:26.294 --> 20:35.022
And the rules of the graduate school said, of the PhDs, you were obliged to publish your book, your dissertation.

20:35.082 --> 20:37.524
That's a requirement.

20:37.824 --> 20:39.045
It wasn't literally enforced.

20:39.065 --> 20:40.327
They didn't take the degree away.

20:41.187 --> 20:51.096
But up until, say, the 1960s, relatively easy to get published with a reasonably good dissertation.

20:51.548 --> 20:57.575
And Yale Press would do a lot of them.

20:57.615 --> 20:58.816
Did they have to be subsidized?

20:59.017 --> 21:04.824
Well, you know, you can get into the economics.

21:04.904 --> 21:05.865
Yeah.

21:06.085 --> 21:07.987
Oh, sure.

21:08.988 --> 21:18.079
And the Franklin Papers, of course, are very, very heavily subsidized.

21:19.595 --> 21:32.647
Yale organization or organization at Yale, which has been very generous, is the Skrull and Key Society, which is second to Skrull and Bones in age among the Yale senior societies or secret societies.

21:33.828 --> 21:40.334
And I think their legal name is the Kingsley Trust.

21:40.515 --> 21:48.522
So if you come upon some generous gifts, Kingsley Trust, that's

21:48.907 --> 21:51.210
scroll and key society.

21:52.271 --> 21:53.213
It's a very good society.

21:53.253 --> 21:58.720
It doesn't go in with all this crap of the scholars.

21:58.740 --> 22:05.008
Well, it looks like they're actually backing some legitimate enterprises here.

22:05.629 --> 22:11.176
Well, you say they subsidize, what, publication of books or research or scholarship?

22:11.236 --> 22:11.897
Books, I think.

22:12.578 --> 22:14.340
Or maybe just unrestricted.

22:14.641 --> 22:15.442
I don't know.

22:15.482 --> 22:16.023
I just know.

22:16.524 --> 22:18.587
The King of the Trust is something you have to look for.

22:18.948 --> 22:19.689
Yeah, yeah.

22:19.709 --> 22:21.772
Bart Giamatti, who was president of Yale.

22:21.812 --> 22:22.213
Wonderful.

22:22.393 --> 22:23.154
A wonderful guy.

22:23.354 --> 22:26.138
He was a very prominent member of Scroll and Key.

22:29.464 --> 22:30.645
Great fan of baseball.

22:30.826 --> 22:32.007
Oh, yeah.

22:32.027 --> 22:33.410
And the Red Sox got Red Sox.

22:33.430 --> 22:34.872
Yeah, wouldn't he have loved to have seen that?

22:34.892 --> 22:35.733
Yeah.

22:35.753 --> 22:36.875
I'm an anti-Yankee fan.

22:37.776 --> 22:37.956
Oh, yeah.

22:37.976 --> 22:38.978
If that's anyone who beats the Yankees.

22:38.998 --> 22:40.400
Anybody who beats the Yankees.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.161
So where are you from?

22:41.522 --> 22:42.844
I'm originally from New Jersey.

22:42.924 --> 22:43.184
Oh, you are?

22:43.485 --> 22:43.585
Yeah.

22:44.543 --> 22:51.971
Born in New York, New Jersey, lived in Suburban Summit, and then in Connecticut, except for those three years at Duke since 1950.

22:52.431 --> 22:58.197
But really have been here for basically your entire professional life.

22:59.959 --> 23:09.589
In this work that you are doing on this Yale history, do you have any thoughts on the importance of a press in the life of a university?

23:11.324 --> 23:24.899
Oh, I think they're fairly conventional thoughts, that the dissemination of knowledge is the fundamental purpose of a university.

23:26.040 --> 23:34.029
The teaching, the discovery of knowledge, and its dissemination are sort of the three pillars of university and university purpose.

23:34.610 --> 23:39.475
Of course, the university's got so many other purposes now that it's hard to describe.

23:40.973 --> 23:55.426
One issue which I think is obviously affecting all university presses and the articles that one reads in places like the Chronicle of Higher Education point to... Do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures of you?

23:55.446 --> 23:55.886
No, not at all.

23:55.926 --> 23:56.427
Not at all.

23:56.467 --> 24:07.857
Should there be a border between academic presses and trade houses?

24:07.897 --> 24:09.478
That's something I...

24:09.779 --> 24:16.309
Yeah, and the border is nonexistent in a way.

24:17.091 --> 24:21.918
So university presses must act in many ways like trade houses.

24:22.138 --> 24:24.302
That's what they've learned, isn't it?

24:24.422 --> 24:24.582
Yeah.

24:24.602 --> 24:35.179
But you also hear that, at many institutions, that it's almost a given that the university press will operate in the red, that it's accepted and it's understood.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.623
Not that they wouldn't love that.

24:37.763 --> 24:38.764
I've been, you know.

24:38.844 --> 24:43.690
There's a book they call The Bullshit Book down at Princeton, which they, is this the title of the book?

24:43.890 --> 24:44.431
Oh, huh.

24:44.451 --> 24:45.031
Have you heard of that?

24:45.052 --> 24:45.692
No, I haven't.

24:45.712 --> 24:47.975
Oh, it's a little 80-page mark.

24:47.995 --> 24:49.036
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

24:49.056 --> 24:50.578
Oh, no, I saw it on the shelf.

24:50.618 --> 24:52.861
It's become an extraordinary bestseller.

24:52.881 --> 24:56.165
Yeah, I saw that on the counter in the bookstore.

24:56.185 --> 24:59.829
And they just can't believe their fabulous luck.

24:59.949 --> 25:01.832
It's a New York Times bestseller, you know.

25:01.952 --> 25:02.493
Yeah, yeah.

25:02.513 --> 25:03.173
Yeah, that's what I said.

25:03.434 --> 25:04.575
Yeah.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.737
I spent a minute and read it.

25:08.839 --> 25:09.219
Right.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.421
I'll shoot a couple.

25:10.441 --> 25:11.423
This is just for my own.

25:11.443 --> 25:12.324
Sure, sure.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.788
I just like the pictures.

25:14.808 --> 25:15.148
Go ahead.

25:15.168 --> 25:33.076
But when I was on the Publications Committee, I was something of a critic of the Yale Press reaching out and getting republication rights of trade books, because the trade publishers, for, I guess, tax reasons, didn't want to have an inventory.

25:33.096 --> 25:33.837
I didn't want to keep

25:34.390 --> 25:37.833
stock of these books, and so they were available.

25:38.574 --> 25:40.856
And so Yale was doing some of that.

25:40.876 --> 25:47.382
And I was saying, and maybe I was being a little too pure, this isn't new scholarship.

25:47.402 --> 25:50.084
This book exists.

25:51.245 --> 25:56.310
And all you're going to do is, well, maybe prolong its life in print.

25:56.330 --> 26:04.077
But these weren't great scholarly books to begin with.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.623
And I've been the reader for a time.

26:08.643 --> 26:11.786
I don't know if God knows how many talents in that experience.

26:11.946 --> 26:18.372
I don't know if it's for me, but... I'm sorry, sir.

26:18.672 --> 26:19.353
He's not here.

26:19.473 --> 26:20.394
I'm using his office.

26:21.835 --> 26:23.697
He's not here?

26:27.800 --> 26:28.221
I can't.

26:28.301 --> 26:32.044
I'm actually just using the office while he's away for today.

26:32.304 --> 26:34.266
So I can't help you, sir.

26:37.587 --> 26:47.297
I expect not, because the people who showed me into the office told me he's going to be away for a while, which is why they allow me to.

26:47.657 --> 26:48.158
I think so.

26:49.599 --> 26:51.301
Good luck to you.

26:51.321 --> 26:51.821
Sorry.

26:53.063 --> 27:01.391
So, um, I've been as a reader for lots of manuscripts.

27:03.433 --> 27:07.257
What are you looking for as a reader?

27:08.114 --> 27:14.482
originality, new light on the subject, good writing or something.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.145
Which you don't always necessarily get with it.

27:17.246 --> 27:17.706
That's right.

27:17.766 --> 27:18.707
I'm a hound on that.

27:19.649 --> 27:24.395
Are there any books that you champion that you're particularly proud of?

27:24.415 --> 27:29.081
Hmm.

27:29.101 --> 27:29.381
I don't know.

27:29.401 --> 27:30.042
Well, I think about it.

27:30.062 --> 27:31.063
Yeah, yeah.

27:31.083 --> 27:31.504
Well, anyway.

27:31.864 --> 27:32.185
Yeah.

27:32.285 --> 27:34.247
But so go ahead.

27:34.487 --> 27:35.909
Originality and good writing.

27:37.111 --> 27:37.311
Yeah.

27:38.320 --> 27:47.234
Well, one book which is a little different, because it was a memoir by Al Kernan called In Plato's Cave.

27:48.396 --> 28:05.644
Al Kernan was a Yale faculty member, then moved to Princeton, and he's a literary conservative in English, deplored deconstruction, postmodernism, and his literary views are

28:06.333 --> 28:09.718
those that I share, and it was just a wonderful memoir.

28:13.463 --> 28:19.451
This is really off the track, but I did get into a bit of a discussion with the editors.

28:19.471 --> 28:22.055
I forget who the particular editor of that book was.

28:25.179 --> 28:32.329
I found quite a few errors, not fundamental errors, but errors.

28:32.349 --> 28:33.431
He had some dates wrong.

28:33.491 --> 28:34.973
He had some names wrong.

28:35.459 --> 28:39.105
He said he'd seen someone at a certain time when someone, in fact, had died.

28:39.205 --> 28:40.748
You know, little things like that.

28:40.768 --> 28:43.392
They're not that little, though.

28:43.412 --> 28:43.693
Yeah, yeah.

28:44.093 --> 28:47.659
And so I had a long list of those things.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.445
The editor came back and said, no, this is an authentic text.

28:51.485 --> 28:54.310
This is a memoir.

28:55.051 --> 28:56.093
And I said, come on.

28:56.534 --> 29:00.420
It isn't as if we're republishing a long...

29:00.957 --> 29:04.561
lost a manuscript of Chaucer.

29:04.822 --> 29:06.964
We're not going to change Chaucer.

29:06.984 --> 29:07.284
Oh, well.

29:09.607 --> 29:12.230
Could the book get published?

29:12.290 --> 29:12.891
Oh, yeah.

29:12.931 --> 29:14.293
With its inaccuracies?

29:14.393 --> 29:14.633
Yeah.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.415
Really?

29:16.455 --> 29:17.917
They're very small, but, you know.

29:18.277 --> 29:19.599
A wrong date is a wrong date.

29:19.999 --> 29:25.166
It drives me crazier than to have somebody come to me tell me that.

29:25.446 --> 29:28.129
And I think anyone who's honest

29:28.430 --> 29:31.413
with himself or herself knows that memory is fallible.

29:33.635 --> 29:42.963
In this book I'm writing, I will, in the first draft, write something as I remember it, and then check up on myself and find I didn't remember it right.

29:43.083 --> 29:48.207
I generally find when I pull stuff out of memory that I'm damn certain it's correct.

29:48.227 --> 29:51.930
Those are the times when I make the mistakes.

29:51.990 --> 29:52.551
Yeah, yeah.

29:52.571 --> 29:57.255
Because I haven't, I got a letter from a Navy, a Royal,

29:57.539 --> 30:01.143
Captain in the British Royal Navy, based in Islamabad, of all places.

30:01.163 --> 30:02.866
It must be intelligence.

30:03.486 --> 30:09.914
And he had found a copy of my first book, A Gentle Madness, in a second-hand bookstore.

30:09.934 --> 30:10.475
And he loved it.

30:10.495 --> 30:14.340
He was writing me a fan letter all the way from, you know.

30:14.360 --> 30:18.805
And I knew he was driving, but something said, it says here you're a former naval officer, which I am.

30:19.122 --> 30:23.449
And he said, how in the hell did you get the Battle of Trafalgar into 1812 when it's 1807?

30:23.489 --> 30:25.291
No, no, it's five.

30:25.592 --> 30:28.236
1805, but you know, 1805.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.863
And it was one of those throwaway lines.

30:32.883 --> 30:39.493
I was learning about Samuel Pepys and how he was credited with coming back and building the great professional Navy, which

30:39.777 --> 30:43.682
But I had to throw the date of the battle at my life.

30:43.702 --> 30:44.023
Why even bother?

30:44.043 --> 30:44.383
I didn't need it.

30:44.403 --> 30:50.492
But it's those kinds of things that come back to really grab you.

30:50.512 --> 30:54.117
And you wish they'd found it five editions ago when I could have fixed it.

30:54.617 --> 31:03.790
Well, an issue involves fact-checking for presses.

31:05.152 --> 31:08.316
I have a feeling reading books in general...

31:08.836 --> 31:14.423
The publishers do not assume much responsibility for fact-checking, or maybe none.

31:15.084 --> 31:16.746
It's all up to the author.

31:17.187 --> 31:18.168
And the copy editor.

31:18.268 --> 31:19.850
Yeah, well, the copy editor should do it.

31:19.890 --> 31:32.567
So when I'm a reader, I will give them a prose evaluation, and I might give them 20 pages of, you know, page 209, line 6.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.991
I did something, I have a book coming out in December with Harper's, and I

31:36.342 --> 31:51.513
and I did something with this book I've never done before, but I have profiles of about a dozen major people, like Robert Coles and Sherwin Newland here, and Helen Vendler, and Robert Fagels and Elaine Fagels.

31:51.534 --> 31:55.161
So what unites them?

31:55.394 --> 32:01.201
The title of the book is Every Book Its Reader, The Power of the Printed Word to Stir the World of Books.

32:01.461 --> 32:06.327
I basically figured these are some of the greatest readers that I've ever had an opportunity to meet.

32:06.347 --> 32:10.452
And so Venlo on poetry, Fagels on classical works in translation.

32:10.492 --> 32:15.518
Newland I knew before he published a word other than medical stuff.

32:15.578 --> 32:16.539
Yes, great books.

32:16.559 --> 32:22.026
And we have, he and I have the same literary agent who actually proposed to him how we got to tie a book.

32:22.259 --> 32:29.152
But in this instance, I'd never done this before, but I allowed them to read the sections that I wrote about them.

32:30.655 --> 32:32.238
And I mean, why not?

32:32.258 --> 32:36.706
And it's amazing, especially when I tape everything, you figure you must have it right.

32:36.766 --> 32:37.748
Well, you don't have it right.

32:37.808 --> 32:40.032
You have a chance to go over what you said.

32:40.197 --> 32:42.559
You might say, oh, man, how the hell did I say that?

32:43.340 --> 32:44.661
It's amazing how many.

32:44.681 --> 32:52.229
Christopher Ricks, he wanted to change the whole structure so it didn't sound like spoken conversation at all.

32:52.249 --> 32:54.191
It became, but it's fine.

32:54.611 --> 32:56.173
I have Harold Bloom in there, who's a kick.

32:56.573 --> 32:57.715
Oh, indeed.

32:57.795 --> 32:59.296
He's something else.

32:59.316 --> 33:00.317
Oh, boy.

33:00.337 --> 33:03.440
And I love Helen Dunlop and Daniel Aaron.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.142
We talked about the Lives of America.

33:05.122 --> 33:05.803
Oh.

33:05.823 --> 33:08.085
And Matt Bruckley down at South Carolina.

33:08.105 --> 33:11.629
And I've got Breon Mitchell at Indiana, who's a modern translator.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.551
That's great.

33:12.631 --> 33:13.412
It'll be fun.

33:13.472 --> 33:14.993
I'll make sure you get a copy of it.

33:15.073 --> 33:15.674
It's coming out.

33:15.714 --> 33:17.116
I'm very excited about it, in fact.

33:17.156 --> 33:19.438
I don't know how we get off on that, but making sure it's right.

33:19.579 --> 33:21.000
Yeah, yeah.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.502
But readability is something.

33:22.983 --> 33:27.788
You find that when you were on the publications committee that you would argue about

33:28.207 --> 33:32.811
There's potential, but it didn't deliver.

33:33.212 --> 33:41.960
The way the Publications Committee operated, and this is now five to ten years ago, I'm afraid exactly when I got off.

33:41.980 --> 33:42.861
I think I got off.

33:43.141 --> 33:44.642
Are you waiting for somebody?

33:44.682 --> 33:45.523
No, no, exactly.

33:45.543 --> 33:46.284
We've got plenty of time.

33:46.444 --> 33:46.905
Okay.

33:48.406 --> 33:58.095
Was that we would meet monthly in the big boardroom there with sandwiches.

33:58.413 --> 33:59.875
the director of the press presides.

34:00.876 --> 34:07.303
And we would get, in advance, so much stuff we needed a wheelbarrow, practically, to bring it over.

34:08.104 --> 34:22.900
Usually not full manuscripts, but it would be the appraisal of the editor who was in charge of that book, a proposed book, plus the outside reader's evaluations, and maybe a chapter or two.

34:22.921 --> 34:25.163
So there were

34:25.649 --> 34:30.634
And we would, you know, 300 books a year and 10 meetings a year.

34:30.674 --> 34:35.819
You know, we'd go roughly through 10 every meeting, about a three-hour meeting.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.883
And so three things could happen.

34:39.983 --> 34:42.285
One, this is slam dunk.

34:42.485 --> 34:42.765
Great.

34:44.006 --> 34:44.907
It's a well-known author.

34:45.067 --> 34:46.729
Yale Press has published this author before.

34:46.769 --> 34:47.830
It's going to be a great success.

34:47.950 --> 34:48.491
Go for it.

34:51.373 --> 34:54.036
Two, this book has got a lot of promise.

34:54.995 --> 35:00.060
But the readers have pointed to some flaws.

35:01.481 --> 35:06.826
Some of us as members of the committee have noted some flaws.

35:08.047 --> 35:11.490
Encourage the author to revise and resubmit.

35:12.331 --> 35:23.061
And three, no, not now, not ever, which is fairly rare, because all of these books had been recommended by an editor.

35:23.598 --> 35:31.448
So the politics of that is a little dicey, because if you really reject a book, you're reflecting on the editor.

35:32.709 --> 35:37.054
It is a whole different dynamic.

35:37.114 --> 35:47.547
I know that my deadline for this manuscript, you know, 50,000 words, is, well, if I go longer, I go longer.

35:47.948 --> 35:48.729
next year.

35:49.290 --> 35:50.632
And then they said, publication is 2008.

35:50.692 --> 35:53.315
I said, I said, you're right.

35:53.375 --> 35:57.100
I said, I turned books in, 150,000 word books.

35:57.741 --> 36:08.776
And this book that's coming out in December, I turned in in March, and we were already down the copy and everything, and now I'm waiting for the galleys to come back any day now, you know, and I'll have two, three passes of the galleys.

36:08.796 --> 36:13.062
Yeah, I mean, my book, I've had

36:13.362 --> 36:14.844
in the time that I've been with my big book.

36:14.864 --> 36:15.645
But that's the way it is.

36:15.685 --> 36:20.310
Yeah, but I've been very slow on it because the task has just been so enormous.

36:20.670 --> 36:29.880
But I've had four editors on it, including John Ryden himself, which was a mistake because John was too busy to be a good editor.

36:29.900 --> 36:35.967
And I've got Chris Rogers now, who's good, who I'd worked with before on a Knopf book.

36:35.987 --> 36:39.771
Anyway, where are we?

36:40.031 --> 36:43.335
Just the Publications Committee.

36:43.585 --> 36:51.953
Every faculty member who served on that committee, I think, would agree that it's perhaps the most interesting thing one can do at the university.

36:53.535 --> 36:53.795
Really?

36:54.095 --> 37:05.506
Yeah, because you meet with faculty in other fields, not much in science, because, again, as you know, science publication is almost entirely in the scientific journals.

37:06.427 --> 37:12.833
But through the humanities, social sciences, natural science, art, you know, the whole thing.

37:13.977 --> 37:21.105
So we got a pretty good insight into what was coming, what people were writing, what the press was doing.

37:22.286 --> 37:23.207
It was very satisfying.

37:23.227 --> 37:25.689
Maybe even having a hand in its direction.

37:25.750 --> 37:26.991
Yeah, yeah.

37:27.011 --> 37:29.674
How do you feel just to switch gears entirely?

37:30.835 --> 37:38.483
I know the Franklin project goes on apace, and the Lord knows how many volumes of that there will be.

37:38.716 --> 37:50.651
There is a move afoot, especially where you get this federal funding that may not be forthcoming for some of these projects, and there's a lot of movement also to do this stuff strictly electronically.

37:50.671 --> 37:51.212
Yeah, I know.

37:51.252 --> 37:53.514
How do you feel about the book?

37:53.594 --> 37:55.797
Well, I feel sad and nostalgic.

37:55.857 --> 37:59.702
I mean, do you think it's a terminal species?

37:59.982 --> 38:00.243
Yeah.

38:01.104 --> 38:04.848
That is the... The grand monument publishing project.

38:04.868 --> 38:06.951
The Woodrow Wilson papers, I think they're...

38:07.252 --> 38:17.025
The Franklin Papers, I think, are up to 80 or something like that, and still a way to go.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.207
Maybe 15 more.

38:18.367 --> 38:29.062
And a very good friend of mine is Barbara Oberg, who was the editor of the Franklin Papers, and then she was lured away to Princeton to be editor of the Jefferson Papers, so that's where she is now.

38:30.985 --> 38:37.073
But she's spending most of her time, as far as I could tell, trying to raise money.

38:40.428 --> 38:52.323
I, you know, as a historian, have used these monumental publications, well-edited collections of original papers.

38:53.685 --> 39:08.344
But I think electronic, we'll take the, I mean, if we're going to have the papers of George W. Bush, I'll have for a bit.

39:08.444 --> 39:09.085
We're going to have them.

39:09.453 --> 39:12.537
All blank papers.

39:12.557 --> 39:13.177
Yeah, yeah.

39:13.197 --> 39:14.399
I taught the son of a bitch.

39:14.419 --> 39:15.080
Did you really?

39:15.921 --> 39:16.021
Yeah.

39:16.041 --> 39:16.261
Excuse me.

39:16.281 --> 39:16.701
Did he read?

39:16.862 --> 39:17.402
No, that's fine.

39:17.462 --> 39:18.604
No, he had very low grades.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.145
Great kindred spirits.

39:20.226 --> 39:25.352
I was sort of embarrassed because... This will be off the record, too, but I'd love to hear it.

39:25.552 --> 39:30.377
Well, the... And my word is solid.

39:30.578 --> 39:36.945
No, when he was nominated for the presidency in 2000,

39:37.718 --> 39:42.244
The New Yorker magazine, for some reason, got hold of his grade transcript.

39:42.264 --> 39:42.804
I remember that.

39:43.385 --> 39:44.767
And published a facsimile of it.

39:45.528 --> 39:52.897
And that's, you know, that's a violation of law, the so-called Buckley Amendment.

39:52.917 --> 40:01.327
But the transcript just gave the course numbers, like History 32 and so on, but didn't give the professors, and the title of the course.

40:02.729 --> 40:05.312
So somebody could have put that together.

40:06.068 --> 40:08.952
They did, and Washington posted it immediately.

40:09.192 --> 40:16.964
They called me, and I could identify, even without going back to a course catalog, most of them.

40:16.984 --> 40:32.025
So the one course was a seminar in history, and taught by a guy who's

40:32.748 --> 40:35.777
since become the chief of manuscripts of the Library of Congress.

40:35.817 --> 40:41.253
And I said to the Washington Post, you're practically within shouting distance.

40:41.273 --> 40:41.754
Call him up.

40:42.055 --> 40:44.783
And so the guy said, George Bush?

40:45.691 --> 40:48.214
He said, I prided myself on knowing every student.

40:48.234 --> 40:49.135
This was a seminar.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.456
There were no more than 12 students.

40:50.476 --> 40:52.579
I have no memory of him whatsoever.

40:52.679 --> 40:55.882
He probably never showed up.

40:55.922 --> 40:58.245
Like the Air Force equipment.

40:58.265 --> 40:58.545
Oh, well.

40:58.926 --> 41:10.939
At any rate, on the great monumental publications, I just don't see them coming anymore.

41:11.881 --> 41:21.012
I mean, you certainly can't do more electronically in terms of volume, but there's still something about having that artifact, that hard copy.

41:23.315 --> 41:38.614
But I would think what you probably should do, because it's scholars in most cases that would be using this material, would be to put them online, but in

41:39.708 --> 41:45.440
scanned in facsimile, so that you see an image of the original.

41:47.103 --> 41:48.326
I think that's so important.

41:48.406 --> 41:54.198
It's like trying to read Emily Dickinson's poetry when she never published.

41:54.218 --> 41:55.901
I mean, so how she wrote them.

41:55.921 --> 41:56.382
Oh, yeah.

41:56.623 --> 41:59.809
So the fascicles, I think they call them.

42:00.059 --> 42:04.985
a Yale man, Ralph Franklin, I think, a supervisor and Harvard publisher.

42:05.085 --> 42:06.647
You really have to see them.

42:06.667 --> 42:10.151
In the order that she found them, she self-published them in her mind.

42:10.711 --> 42:12.794
And that's the facsimile, the reason why you have to see them.

42:12.814 --> 42:25.949
What discourages me, I think, and you hear this from, I think, almost any historian, you've got undergraduates who are so adept at the internet, they think that all knowledge is to be found on the internet.

42:26.029 --> 42:27.771
And there was a piece about the University of

42:28.072 --> 42:32.658
Texas at Austin, where the undergraduate library doesn't have any books anymore.

42:32.758 --> 42:33.519
They're moving them out.

42:33.559 --> 42:34.701
They moved them out, yeah.

42:34.901 --> 42:35.622
Not all of them.

42:35.642 --> 42:36.844
Yeah, but most of them.

42:36.864 --> 42:42.151
But this building that was erected to be a library is now all computer terminals.

42:42.171 --> 42:51.683
Yeah, I just gave a talk at Central Michigan University, where they just redid a $55 million library.

42:51.983 --> 42:53.205
I mean, who knew?

42:53.285 --> 42:57.391
You know, up in Michigan, a beautiful library where they have the books.

42:58.192 --> 43:03.099
It's just more or less blend seamlessly with the electronics, and it was kind of nice.

43:03.339 --> 43:06.845
But when you see them just throw out the books as they're doing at Texas.

43:06.985 --> 43:11.852
Yeah, I haven't thrown them out, but we've moved a lot of them off off-site.

43:12.072 --> 43:14.195
Yeah, and I wrote about that in one of my books, and that's fine.

43:14.235 --> 43:15.597
I mean, at least you're not getting rid of the books.

43:16.559 --> 43:19.543
You have 11 million books in Yale.

43:19.743 --> 43:23.728
The number of books checked out is going down.

43:23.948 --> 43:24.229
Is it?

43:24.389 --> 43:25.831
Yeah.

43:25.851 --> 43:26.872
Well, that's not so bad.

43:26.952 --> 43:27.152
No.

43:28.133 --> 43:29.695
But on the graduate level, too?

43:30.036 --> 43:33.640
Well, I don't think they disagree.

43:33.660 --> 43:39.507
The library publishes in its annual report how many books have been checked out, how many checkouts.

43:39.527 --> 43:40.128
Per student?

43:40.789 --> 43:41.710
Well, total.

43:41.810 --> 43:42.892
That is the total number.

43:43.152 --> 43:45.134
How many books have been checked out by readers?

43:45.855 --> 43:47.337
And that number has gone down a little bit.

43:47.823 --> 44:11.974
But there's a statistic, and I cited it in one of my books, I think, that when Berkeley, when their acquisitions started going down, and they started spending less, and this is like within the last 10 years, the number of PhDs awarded started to go down, and then when they started to resume the pace, you could actually relate over 100 years, the ALA statistics that acquisitions

44:12.157 --> 44:12.838
That makes sense.

44:12.878 --> 44:16.403
I mean, if you're getting primary research material, that attracts scholars.

44:16.423 --> 44:20.968
But that's why I asked on the graduate level if that... I can see it in the undergraduate.

44:21.709 --> 44:29.059
Well, for history, most of the real work for dissertation is in unpublished material in most dissertations.

44:29.440 --> 44:35.307
And when I think about purchasing things, of course, that must also... I would think it would involve primary stuff.

44:35.407 --> 44:36.829
And you've got interlibrary loan.

44:37.550 --> 44:42.096
I would think that the... I don't know what the year...

44:42.599 --> 44:56.438
curve that you have for Berkeley, but it would be more the real difficulties the University of California system seem to be having, and then recovery a bit.

44:56.598 --> 44:57.699
Well, they started to .

44:58.320 --> 44:58.600
Okay.

45:00.002 --> 45:06.871
Well, any other, as you can hear, I'm not really a Yale Press insider.

45:06.932 --> 45:09.535
No, but I love this.

45:09.818 --> 45:12.882
That's a great option.

45:12.902 --> 45:13.463
I have to say.

45:13.483 --> 45:18.550
Who would have thought that the Vinland... Why did Paul Mellon buy it, do you think?

45:18.570 --> 45:21.814
Do you think that would be reflected in the correspondence here of the records?

45:21.834 --> 45:22.455
That's interesting.

45:25.839 --> 45:39.437
Given his overwhelming focus on things English, the poem Mellon Gallery, now called the British Arts Center, originally called the Mellon Gallery, and all went into

45:39.738 --> 45:43.822
his philanthropy and art in general, focusing on British.

45:44.063 --> 45:50.470
Well, when I was up in Worcester, he spent a million dollars just to buy the Stubbs pictures out of the Worcester Public Library that they found there.

45:50.510 --> 45:54.074
And it was a million bucks, and how could they turn it down to a million bucks?

45:54.674 --> 45:56.316
And here they are, here.

45:57.878 --> 45:59.960
But the Vinland map, you know, one wonders.

46:00.320 --> 46:06.387
He must have been persuaded of its importance and its authenticity.

46:09.556 --> 46:28.561
My guess is that the Vitors, who were very socially prominent and wealthy, and Alec Vitor, who was about the same age as Paul Mellon, that they may have been personal friends.

46:29.042 --> 46:31.845
That's just a hunch on it.

46:32.046 --> 46:39.175
If it was a forgery, if, the motivation would be what, to tell it?

46:40.218 --> 46:45.767
There was a dealer here in New Haven, but he didn't own it.

46:45.787 --> 46:46.588
Not Bill Reese.

46:46.688 --> 46:46.848
What?

46:46.869 --> 46:47.349
Not Bill Reese.

46:47.750 --> 46:48.611
No, no, no, no.

46:48.631 --> 46:50.454
Oh, that's too far back.

46:50.474 --> 46:53.539
Yeah, this was a rare book.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.362
You're talking back in the 60s.

46:55.382 --> 46:59.689
Yeah, something like Whitmer or something like that.

46:59.709 --> 47:00.891
Oh, I know who you mean.

47:01.351 --> 47:02.633
Actually, Hannah wrote about him once.

47:02.734 --> 47:04.897
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.082
So he didn't.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.396
He was an intermediary.

47:10.536 --> 47:12.819
He didn't own the... I'll have to check it out.

47:13.019 --> 47:22.290
And the new edition has a good introduction that explains... So, do you think there's anything... So, but, you know, if it was a forgery, someone is going to make a lot of money.

47:22.310 --> 47:24.292
Well, if it's a half a million dollars, that's right.

47:24.672 --> 47:29.138
Because it's more than just somebody being naughty, you know.

47:29.158 --> 47:37.427
You had started by saying that books that have drawn great attention and books that have a degree of notoriety, and I think we talked about...

47:37.593 --> 47:39.535
Yeah, about the notorious books.

47:39.575 --> 47:43.678
Well, The Lonely Crowd, Reisman's The Lonely Crowd.

47:44.259 --> 47:45.280
A million copies.

47:45.400 --> 47:49.744
Yeah, and it may be close to the best-seller.

47:49.764 --> 47:50.264
I think it is.

47:50.465 --> 47:51.466
Yeah, yeah.

47:51.846 --> 47:55.469
And then John Ryland told me the other day about... Ryden.

47:56.010 --> 47:57.371
I'm sorry.

47:57.391 --> 47:58.492
I'm sorry.

47:58.712 --> 48:00.494
I said Ryland.

48:00.534 --> 48:05.338
I said Ryland.

48:06.179 --> 48:14.707
about the decision to publish Long Day's Journey Into Night, you know, and how Bennett Serif had given his word to Eugene O'Neill that he wouldn't do it for X number of years.

48:15.068 --> 48:16.409
Oh, yeah.

48:16.469 --> 48:30.182
Carlotta became involved, you know, that she wanted to, and he said, there might be some very good correspondence here that would give you some insight into, you know, and that became, of course, a huge, hugely successful work.

48:30.222 --> 48:31.844
Seen it as a plague several times.

48:32.124 --> 48:35.207
But she was adamant about having it done.

48:36.048 --> 48:41.656
Would you mind if I contact you at some point?

48:41.676 --> 48:42.497
Sure, no problem at all.

48:42.517 --> 48:43.318
Follow-ups?

48:43.559 --> 48:44.800
Yeah, I'm here all summer.

48:45.742 --> 48:47.284
It'll probably be a little later than that.

48:47.304 --> 48:48.445
Yeah, okay, I'll be here.

48:48.726 --> 48:51.430
Do you prefer email?

48:51.810 --> 49:00.002
At the moment, I'm having a terrible problem with my computer, and I think it's got a virus in it that I can't seem to get out of.

49:00.082 --> 49:03.827
I mean, I can't open my email, and I keep going to the techies.

49:04.111 --> 49:06.013
I have to buy a completely new computer.

49:06.293 --> 49:07.094
Why don't you phone me?

49:07.214 --> 49:07.735
Okay.

49:07.755 --> 49:09.437
It's area code 203.

49:09.697 --> 49:10.999
Mm-hmm.

49:11.019 --> 49:15.604
865-9495.

49:15.924 --> 49:16.344
Terrific.

49:17.406 --> 49:17.626
Okay.

49:17.646 --> 49:19.448
It won't be for a while.

49:19.628 --> 49:32.182
I'm going to get a massive material here, and I told Janice that the next time that we'll do one interview, and then I'll really spend the day, and I think I'm ready now to start going through this stuff.

49:32.202 --> 49:33.223
If you were doing this,

49:33.777 --> 49:34.999
What would you like to see?

49:35.399 --> 49:47.775
Well, I guess, given my, in taking this literally, that my focus is on the concern is the university as a whole.

49:48.496 --> 49:57.208
So I would want to see, and indeed I almost deliberately said I can't do everything and I'm not going to do radio press in this big book.

49:57.228 --> 50:01.894
I would want to see how the presidents, the provosts,

50:02.009 --> 50:07.397
the green-eye-shaded people dealt with the press.

50:07.417 --> 50:07.958
In what way?

50:07.978 --> 50:13.386
Well, I don't know how much subsidy the university provides now.

50:14.728 --> 50:15.849
Maybe almost none.

50:16.310 --> 50:17.272
Maybe none.

50:17.292 --> 50:18.133
I really don't know.

50:18.293 --> 50:23.641
But of course, it's a regular budgetary unit of the university.

50:23.661 --> 50:25.624
So that isn't very sexy.

50:26.065 --> 50:31.813
But for the overall operation of the university and the setting of priorities,

50:32.350 --> 50:39.541
outside the Yale Press, I would be interested in that.

50:44.349 --> 50:46.352
How they perceive the press.

50:46.372 --> 50:46.993
Yeah, exactly.

50:47.033 --> 50:49.698
Perceive the role of it.

50:49.998 --> 50:54.005
Do they think it should have kind of an independent ?

50:54.505 --> 50:58.071
You don't find presidents and deans

50:58.507 --> 51:01.250
in public statements mention Yale Press very often.

51:01.390 --> 51:03.512
Well, I mean, yeah, maybe because it's so successful.

51:03.532 --> 51:05.254
Yeah, yeah.

51:05.794 --> 51:09.037
And it has managed to avoid, I guess, great controversy.

51:09.177 --> 51:09.838
Yeah, yeah.

51:09.858 --> 51:10.198
It has.

51:10.238 --> 51:11.159
Would you agree with that?

51:11.199 --> 51:11.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:12.040 --> 51:14.202
I mean, people kind of laughed at the Vinland-Let Matt thing.

51:14.783 --> 51:15.864
I mean, that was sort of a joke.

51:16.284 --> 51:16.805
You think so?

51:16.825 --> 51:17.185
Yeah.

51:17.205 --> 51:21.569
Well, it seemed to be a joke, except to the Italians of New Haven, who took it very seriously.

51:21.589 --> 51:25.273
But still, if there was any

51:25.844 --> 51:51.700
error there that it was that scholars were not consulted yeah and that's probably still you know and not necessarily inexcusable but uh well they wanted to make a big secret out of it uh surprise so uh so maybe somebody would chester kerr had a lot to do just occur yeah he's dead now and he's he's uh someone that had morgan said the other day was uh he the press is me i mean he was the press was really his well he was a very

51:51.983 --> 51:54.706
Creative and egocentric and funny.

51:54.947 --> 51:56.228
I mean, he was just hilarious.

51:57.029 --> 51:57.490
Great win.

51:58.051 --> 51:59.873
He told me one story.

51:59.893 --> 52:02.696
In fact, I forget who the individual was on the table.

52:02.776 --> 52:06.581
He wanted to bring this editor in on the Franklin paper to some board.

52:07.342 --> 52:08.864
And he said, well, that's ridiculous.

52:08.884 --> 52:10.526
That's like bringing the Heiner's Help on.

52:10.566 --> 52:13.430
That's exactly right.

52:13.450 --> 52:15.692
He is the Heiner's Help.

52:15.712 --> 52:21.079
Why shouldn't he be here in this decision-making process?

52:21.835 --> 52:28.784
But then when he retired as director of the Yale Press, he went back into trade.

52:30.746 --> 52:33.209
And he was a great friend of the president of the university, which helped.

52:33.229 --> 52:33.690
Yeah.

52:34.511 --> 52:35.512
Well, he was very social.

52:38.135 --> 52:39.136
Big house on Humphrey Street.

52:39.156 --> 52:41.279
They had renown for their parties.

52:42.761 --> 52:44.904
Well, it's going to be a lot of fun.

52:44.924 --> 52:46.906
Thank you so much for coming in.

52:47.166 --> 52:48.768
And I like a good hour talk.

52:49.129 --> 52:50.070
Yeah, good to meet you.
