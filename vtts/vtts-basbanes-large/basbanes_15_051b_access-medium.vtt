WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:24.269
It's going to be easy.

00:24.289 --> 00:27.192
I can assure you that any administration that I'm responsible for everything it can in the occupation to restore peace and stability and harmony.

00:27.212 --> 00:28.694
Would you just say once again, as president of the United States, I would.

00:28.714 --> 00:29.154
I wonder if you could.

00:29.174 --> 00:29.875
I might have dismissed that as far.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.236
Everything I can in that occupation to provide whatever help we can

00:31.925 --> 00:54.848
eventually through the United Nations to restore the kind of peace, harmony, stability which I think all people of goodwill in the Greek and circus peoples would like to say to restore.

00:54.868 --> 00:55.249
But in my judgment,

00:56.140 --> 01:11.700
In 1974, I think it was 74, wasn't it when that took place?

01:11.720 --> 01:16.667
I believe in 1974, the United States could have stopped it, and we didn't do it.

01:16.687 --> 01:17.367
Have you ever been to Greece, sir?

01:17.387 --> 01:19.250
Yes, 1976.

01:19.270 --> 01:20.772
I was supposed to go back with my dear wife this May.

01:20.792 --> 01:21.573
Unfortunately, something else had been.

01:21.593 --> 01:22.814
Kenny's been there, I don't know, four times or something.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.797
But we had plans to go back in May this year.

01:25.368 --> 01:53.232
but we had a wonderful visit in 76 in my first administration the greek government invited kidding me over and we not only spent time in athens but we visited my mother's house we went to the although my dad grew up in asia minor which was a town about a predominantly greek town about 30 miles from smyrna his parents were committed in so we went back to

01:54.612 --> 02:17.877
the village way up in the mountains.

02:17.897 --> 02:19.218
And the name of the village until recently was Bagheia, literally.

02:19.238 --> 02:23.322
And the story we were told was back in the 15th, 16th century, whatever, pirates were constantly invading coastal villages, and burning and pillaging and killing the men and taking the women and children.

02:23.342 --> 02:23.843
Finally, a group of these

02:24.818 --> 02:51.197
a group of people in one of those coastal villages decided that they just wouldn't put up with it anymore and they wanted to go someplace where they could get away from the pirates and laugh again and so on so they ran up in the mountains and they found it this little village which was named Dagella seven or eight ten years ago I guess it was maybe longer now it might have been seven or eight years prior to 1976 for some reason they decided to change the name to Pelopi P-E-L-O-P-I so it is now known as Pelopi

02:51.532 --> 03:09.879
I always heard it as a kid.

03:09.899 --> 03:15.006
We went up there and the whole town was out waiting for us.

03:15.026 --> 03:15.407
What year was this?

03:15.427 --> 03:15.487
76.

03:15.507 --> 03:17.009
Well, the most emotional experience of my life.

03:17.029 --> 03:17.690
Have you ever met Mr. Papandreou?

03:17.710 --> 03:17.790
Yes.

03:17.810 --> 03:20.374
In fact, I first met him when he was here in Boston during the... He was teaching, I think, in Canada at the time and came to...

03:20.860 --> 03:30.353
meeting here in Boston and Andy Miller rallying in Boston.

03:30.713 --> 03:36.802
We met with Carmen Lease and some of the top Greek officials in 76 when we were there, but he was Carmen Grao at that time.

03:36.822 --> 03:38.344
What are your impressions of Mr. Carmen Grao and his government?

03:38.364 --> 03:38.945
Do you have any?

03:39.525 --> 03:41.969
Well, he's an interesting man.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.970
He's very independent.

03:51.202 --> 04:14.619
I think the reason the United States ought to have a better relationship than we have today, I think, as President and I, could help to build that kind of relationship.

04:14.639 --> 04:16.382
I would look forward to working with him and the Greek government and the Greek people.

04:17.965 --> 04:37.160
There's been a lot of antagonism and a lot of tension between us and the Cabrera government.

04:37.180 --> 04:39.805
During these past six or seven years, there's plenty of blame to go around, but in my judgment, we have a much better relationship.

04:40.595 --> 04:44.219
I would love to have the opportunity to build that country.

04:44.239 --> 04:49.406
There is tremendous tension between Greece and Turkey, each of which is an important NATO ally.

04:49.426 --> 04:56.114
Do you think that, as a Greek-American, you could help affect some kind of rapprochement, or do you think you could be perceived... I hope so.

04:56.254 --> 04:56.835
I hope so.

04:56.955 --> 04:58.857
I just want to ask the question.

04:58.957 --> 05:04.684
Are you could be perceived by the government in Ankara as biased in favor of athletes?

05:04.704 --> 05:07.788
Well, I'm an American first, obviously, but I'm proud of my Greek heritage.

05:08.128 --> 05:09.690
That's the way I approach the presidency.

05:12.843 --> 05:37.578
And there's no question that as long as the Turkish occupation of Cyprus continues, that's going to be a festering sore in the relationship, along with some of the properties that have recently occurred in Aegean.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.340
But, you know, my father grew up in Western Turkey, and it was very important that they

05:39.978 --> 06:07.757
stability and as much harmony as possible within nato and between greece and turkey i think i think it's possible to make some real progress in improving that relationship with the help of the united states how do you think turkish officials view the prospects of a dukakish presidency well i have an answer i would hope you haven't heard any hints or i would hope that they would

06:08.564 --> 06:17.180
approach it in a positive and constructive spirit.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.726
You enjoy a well-earned reputation for honesty, integrity, and truthfulness.

06:19.634 --> 06:38.624
Yet with the disclosure last month of your wife Kitty's treatment during her first term for a diet pill dependency, it was reported that when she was in Minnesota to cure that problem, you announced that she was being treated for something else.

06:38.644 --> 06:41.909
Perhaps you might enlighten us on just when it is permissible for a public official to perhaps deceive the public, or at least not be entirely forthcoming.

06:41.929 --> 06:42.890
It was her decision, not mine, and I respect it.

06:42.910 --> 06:43.431
She had this problem.

06:44.272 --> 07:06.043
She'd come to a point in her life where she felt very strongly that she had to rid herself of that dependency.

07:06.063 --> 07:07.125
She just did not feel that she could do so in public.

07:07.145 --> 07:08.146
She had to do it as a personal and private matter.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.650
I respected that and respected her wishes that it would be a personal and private matter unless and until she chose herself.

07:17.448 --> 07:40.709
that are otherwise permitted to become public.

07:40.729 --> 07:42.471
We had a number of friends who knew about it and were extremely helpful and supportive.

07:42.491 --> 07:45.393
But I don't think my wife's health or my children's health or my parents' health is relevant to my business to be president of the United States.

07:45.413 --> 07:45.674
My health is.

07:45.694 --> 07:46.054
And I accept that.

07:48.413 --> 08:11.834
Was your wife's decision to make that announcement influenced in any way by the extraordinary attention given to the private life of Gary Hart and the events that led to his withdrawal as a candidate?

08:11.854 --> 08:12.294
This was her decision.

08:12.314 --> 08:13.475
She would have done this whether I was a candidate or not.

08:13.495 --> 08:14.216
She's a very caring, helping person.

08:14.236 --> 08:15.717
I think everybody knows she's had any experience with chemical dependency.

08:15.737 --> 08:17.259
You can be a lot more helpful if you share your own experiences with others.

08:17.279 --> 08:17.779
She was ready to do that.

08:18.535 --> 08:21.898
I'm sure would have done so.

08:21.918 --> 08:27.523
With the withdrawal of Senator Hart, the Democratic field has become something of a steeplechase with no clear-cut favor.

08:27.984 --> 08:30.066
What do you need to break away from the fact?

08:30.086 --> 08:41.637
Hard work, a very strong message of economic opportunity and good jobs, a foreign policy that reflects our values.

08:41.857 --> 08:43.979
And that's what we're going to do.

08:43.999 --> 08:46.421
Have you given any thought to who you would like to have as a running mate?

08:47.242 --> 08:47.462
I have not.

08:48.117 --> 08:50.300
What we thought at this point is to go out and win the nomination.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.323
Then I'll start thinking about it.

08:52.343 --> 08:54.686
Who do you think would be toughest among the Republicans to beat?

08:54.847 --> 08:56.309
I really have no idea at this point.

08:56.329 --> 08:59.834
I think one of the things a campaign does is to test people out.

08:59.994 --> 09:03.819
You never know until they've gone through a test of that kind.

09:03.839 --> 09:05.482
I think we'll just have to wait and see.

09:06.102 --> 09:10.709
And if your bid falls short, would you accept the vice presidential nomination?

09:10.729 --> 09:12.331
I don't know at this point.

09:12.572 --> 09:13.994
I love being the governor of my state.

09:14.014 --> 09:16.437
I'm very proud of what we've done in Massachusetts.

09:16.957 --> 09:23.310
And I'm still working very hard, even the force of the campaign, to continue to do my job and do it well.

09:23.330 --> 09:27.980
I think I just have to consider that one as an if.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.441
Sorry.

09:28.481 --> 09:29.884
It became a possibility.

09:31.047 --> 09:31.508
And guess what?

09:31.528 --> 09:32.229
We got it all in.

09:32.710 --> 09:33.933
Thank you very much, Governor Dan.

09:34.394 --> 09:34.594
Thank you.

09:42.168 --> 09:48.494
There are two things before I let you hear from the next president of the United States.

09:48.514 --> 09:56.901
It's important for us to get together like this, and we thank you for, and I thank you for, for coming.

09:56.921 --> 10:10.994
But we answer as a tradition, and that is no one has been elected president of the United States since 1948, other than they first watched the New Hampshire primary.

10:11.014 --> 10:11.314
No one.

10:12.897 --> 10:19.305
And there are people who are talking about the Nazis being ahead in any recognition of the state.

10:19.325 --> 10:25.413
And there are those who gave up already as long as they said that it was strong right there.

10:25.433 --> 10:29.077
New Hampshire has a way of the process.

10:30.018 --> 10:38.509
And if you ask that identity, and you can ask that identity, that New Hampshire can be very tough on neighbor politicians.

10:38.529 --> 10:41.773
But it's important for people to leave here today

10:42.378 --> 10:50.010
With an envelope, they ask somebody to contribute a dollar, $5, whatever they can, you contribute it in here.

10:51.533 --> 10:56.200
$5 will be managed by another $5, and it will be $10.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.884
So take an envelope and just mail it in.

10:59.445 --> 11:01.629
Leave it with a supporter, even if there's no money in it.

11:01.649 --> 11:04.213
Just put the name of a supporter for my new guy.

11:04.573 --> 11:05.635
It would be important.

11:06.678 --> 11:14.056
Find five friends, five people that you can register and get them committed to the campaign.

11:14.718 --> 11:22.898
In 1988, there will be about 100 to 105,000 ghost deaths in the state of New Hampshire in a Democratic primary.

11:23.536 --> 11:27.822
This probably here today can make a difference.

11:27.922 --> 11:43.324
I can assure you that if we all contribute and commit ourselves to delivering five votes, even five votes, for my prize, he will win decisively in the primary, and I'm sure will be the next president of the United States.

11:43.664 --> 11:49.172
So please, beyond the nice move and the entertainer that we're going to have today,

11:49.355 --> 11:54.091
There are things that need to happen in this state, in this world of political.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.800
We've got a couple of people that will entertain you as we go around.

11:56.820 --> 11:57.863
We're going to meet everybody.

11:58.433 --> 12:05.721
Rick and Ron Shaw are here with David Scott from the original Kingston Trio.

12:06.462 --> 12:09.705
Costa and George have been waiting for us.

12:09.725 --> 12:12.188
We've seen a couple of songs from the governor.

12:12.208 --> 12:14.430
The show brothers are very famous singers.

12:14.510 --> 12:15.792
They've got a couple of songs to sing.

12:16.452 --> 12:21.318
And one of them is going to be going to have a return.

12:21.458 --> 12:27.124
Because the people of the restitution are wondering, why do you guess the question?

12:27.239 --> 12:28.321
It's a great day.

12:29.002 --> 12:33.269
Thank you so very much for coming up with the help of myself.

12:33.369 --> 12:38.758
The Brooks, Tally, Tally, and Thaw, and the other of our group of Indiana.

12:39.820 --> 12:48.775
And everybody else who's down this morning, I now introduce you to the next President of the United States, Mike Brayden.

13:17.813 --> 13:40.137
Chris, Maria, all of you thank you very, very much, and our host here at Around the Sound Restaurant.

13:40.157 --> 13:40.478
What a nice man.

13:40.498 --> 13:41.819
It would be nice to have around the sound of this country tonight.

13:41.839 --> 13:47.145
Mary, who has been so good today and so pretty to all of you and really bravely here,

13:48.188 --> 13:55.476
In the Panger House, I'm saying she's got a democratic budget out for a public government.

13:55.496 --> 14:02.264
By the way, I'm Mr. Ambassador and Governor's Association of Congress in Michigan.

14:02.284 --> 14:08.011
We're a government manager of the government that's used to kind of that.

14:08.031 --> 14:17.942
I suppose a less set on that event, except to say that I'm getting hopelessly confused on some of these regional software issues.

14:18.378 --> 14:24.566
How do you leave the state's rights to battle against you?

14:24.586 --> 14:25.908
I don't understand.

14:25.928 --> 14:27.369
I don't understand.

14:27.389 --> 14:34.058
It's possible.

14:34.078 --> 14:34.499
In fact, I really am.

14:34.519 --> 14:47.635
I would like to say that states and communities and people in this country have the right to shape their destiny and determine their future and make decisions themselves and their fellow citizens.

14:47.655 --> 14:48.216
But that...

14:49.242 --> 15:00.517
The important and crucial issue of whether or not we're going to protect the public health and safety of our people, states and multiple communities, will have to not be consent.

15:00.537 --> 15:00.778
Not consent.

15:00.798 --> 15:01.819
Well, we're going to change that.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.561
That's what this is all about.

15:05.123 --> 15:17.460
I said to some of you a few weeks ago at another great Democratic event in the state, all the great things about the United States, the first thing you do is appoint a new chair of the director of this.

15:25.304 --> 15:27.287
Let me say thanks to all of you.

15:27.407 --> 15:34.920
Chris has made the introductions, and I just want to add my own special thank you to all of you, and especially those of you in political office.

15:35.240 --> 15:42.993
Before I came to the city to run for the presidency of making me know, I worked a hard six-day week, but Sunday was family day.

15:43.193 --> 15:50.265
Katie and I worked very, very hard for the trip that day for ourselves and our kids, and I know what it means to come out upon a Sunday.

15:50.853 --> 15:54.998
particularly when you are in a life of office and working hard for your decisions.

15:55.198 --> 15:57.921
I'm especially grateful to you for doing that today.

15:57.961 --> 16:02.487
Of course to Chris and Maria for inviting all of you and Mary for coming down.

16:03.188 --> 16:04.309
I'm not going to be with us.

16:05.450 --> 16:19.527
And I'm especially grateful to a visitor who has come all the way to the state of Kansas, who actually grew up in Springfield a few years ago, who should be the first lady of Kansas and missed by a hair.

16:20.435 --> 16:22.980
Jill Docking is with us.

16:23.020 --> 16:25.003
Husband's son is the third governor of Kansas.

16:26.005 --> 16:28.089
I'm sorry to say he wasn't there, Mr. Jill.

16:28.109 --> 16:28.790
He should have been.

16:29.652 --> 16:36.785
The governor of Kansas was, as I assure her, and who knows that tonight, there is life after defeat.

16:36.805 --> 16:36.925
Right?

16:43.233 --> 16:54.205
I'm very grateful for just coming and being part of this, and I hope you all give her a good warm hand of love.

17:01.137 --> 17:05.723
So she's your friend and the neighbor.

17:05.963 --> 17:22.584
Some of you are, some of you aren't, but I just want you to know what the governor of Massachusetts, a guy who says, he's going to be the next one in the United States, we're doing a six-part swan.

17:22.885 --> 17:27.050
See, one of my problems is that my vegetable garden is very important.

17:27.070 --> 17:28.832
And if the value of cruiser, briefly,

17:29.656 --> 17:31.338
I have a vegetable garden.

17:31.538 --> 17:32.900
Now, I have a vegetable garden in my front yard.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.464
I need to know because this is the only place I have sun.

17:36.484 --> 17:37.726
But this is terrible.

17:37.746 --> 17:39.108
And I've been on the road for eight days.

17:39.128 --> 17:40.409
I can't water those things.

17:40.429 --> 17:42.492
I can't take care of it.

17:42.512 --> 17:43.914
So I just want you all to know.

17:43.934 --> 17:54.567
I was out of about 6 or 6 or 16 this morning, elevating my middle plans, weeding them, watering, trying my best to deal with this very hot sun with the mask before coming out here.

17:54.587 --> 17:57.891
So I don't want you to remember that I've been working in my chores around the house.

17:59.643 --> 18:04.229
This has been an incredible performance.

18:04.549 --> 18:12.560
For me, Kitty, by the way, sends her greetings and apologies.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.702
She's on her way to Seattle.

18:15.744 --> 18:25.296
She'll be campaigning in the state of Washington and the state of Washington for the next couple of days.

18:25.850 --> 18:31.797
And really, through a lot of us, including some terrific people who are staffing our financial office and working with somebody to do.

18:33.238 --> 18:38.945
As all of you know, I took a long time thinking about the president, thinking about running.

18:39.966 --> 18:42.428
It wasn't an easy decision.

18:42.448 --> 18:42.909
I love New England.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.050
I love Massachusetts.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.732
I love my job as governor.

18:46.433 --> 18:47.794
I'm very proud of what we've done.

18:48.355 --> 18:54.742
There and throughout New England, we've built economic opportunities and good jobs for good news for ourselves and our fellow citizens.

18:54.762 --> 18:55.603
I think we all are.

18:57.760 --> 19:02.386
But there's nothing quite like money for the president of the United States.

19:02.406 --> 19:04.509
And I want you to know this.

19:05.990 --> 19:09.395
It's wonderful to be home and wonderful to be among some of your friends.

19:09.455 --> 19:20.128
But if there's one thing that campaigning across this country does, it reminds one, once again, of just what a great country this is and what terrific we have on our country.

19:20.148 --> 19:26.316
You are part of a network of literally thousands and thousands of good people, caring people, concerned people.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.390
every evening about this country in our future.

19:30.211 --> 19:34.838
And where we're headed, what we're doing, not just in the United States, but all over this world.

19:37.722 --> 19:40.747
Last Saturday night, I was in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.429
I've never been in South Dakota.

19:42.449 --> 19:48.438
400 people showed up in Sioux Falls, South Dakota Saturday night, about 100 degrees.

19:48.458 --> 19:52.504
To see, to listen, to talk, to exchange ideas.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.729
A month ago, I was in the Iron Range in Evo, Minnesota.

19:56.705 --> 20:01.710
Way up in our country, one of the great old lion, mighty wings of this world.

20:03.552 --> 20:06.655
It lost 10,000 jobs in eight years in the immigration.

20:06.675 --> 20:08.236
I saw that 500 people showed up at breakfast.

20:09.498 --> 20:12.361
They had breakfast for governor Massachusetts.

20:12.381 --> 20:14.483
I've been campaigning all over Iowa, it's all you know.

20:15.023 --> 20:18.206
Places like Waterloo have lost 15,000 jobs in seven years.

20:18.587 --> 20:25.834
And three weeks ago, Friday night, I was in McHale, Texas, eight miles from the Mexican border,

20:26.995 --> 20:35.324
where 1,200 people were sitting, waiting for me to shed a night apart at night at 100 degrees, 90% of the Mexican in America.

20:36.765 --> 20:37.246
Why?

20:37.326 --> 20:43.292
Because one out of every five adult citizens of the Rio Grande Valley was people working that night.

20:45.895 --> 20:56.867
So while we enjoy our good worship here in New England, while we work hard to build a strong, vibrant, and honor future for our people, for our kids, for our families, for our community,

21:00.340 --> 21:08.048
There's one campaign across this country, one understands that there are real concerns and real needs and real wants.

21:08.428 --> 21:24.705
And a vacuum of leadership in places all over this country that are looking, searching, asking for somebody in the presence who understands their problem, cares deeply about them and their families and communities, and wants to do something about them.

21:24.725 --> 21:27.208
And that's why this four months

21:28.319 --> 21:30.061
There have been four or two different months.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.804
That's why we're off such good stuff.

21:33.386 --> 21:46.905
And that's why I think we're beginning to build and now a base, a foundation, a network of people across this country that are going to put together the kind of campaign that you and I believe in and care about and that we're working so hard to create by their new name.

21:49.810 --> 21:56.419
And one of the things that I hear all the time this year, one of the things that people talk to me about all the time,

21:59.302 --> 22:24.685
something called baggage principles because it isn't going to be enough for a candidate in the presidency to have a position on every one of 177 issues addressed about from time to time as long as you know we can't do government institutions without having a position on at least 177 issues to make friends yes those are important where we stand on this issue with that issue with some other issues

22:26.656 --> 22:50.790
But the more I'm out there campaigning, the more I have a chance to talk, listen, exchange ideas for people in farm houses with the farm families that I know, with miners up in Minnesota, with workers down in Texas and people all over this country, the more I have a sense that what they want to know, in addition to where we are on all these issues, is who are we?

22:51.260 --> 22:52.301
What are we?

22:52.321 --> 22:52.862
What are we made of it?

22:53.403 --> 22:54.324
What do we stand for?

22:54.905 --> 22:55.545
What are our values?

22:56.126 --> 22:56.867
What do we believe in?

22:59.170 --> 23:09.483
What are the things that are going to guide us, that we want to guide us, in January 1989, are the front challenges and problems and issues that you and I can't possibly make today?

23:12.106 --> 23:17.453
And that is why it's such a special honor, in a special way, to be

23:18.412 --> 23:32.351
in this restaurant with so many of you in this city, in this city and welcome my dad to this country way back in 1912 because this is where the first came.

23:32.371 --> 23:48.233
And those values and those things that so many of us care about, family, work, education, setting up kids to school, helping them to get their education, building safe and attractive communities,

23:49.546 --> 23:52.810
providence, character, the things are paradoxical.

23:54.052 --> 23:58.958
Those are the things that people in this country are looking for today.

23:58.978 --> 24:15.300
And unfortunately, what they do seeing and reading and watching over the course of the past several weeks don't give them much of a sense that today we're being led by people that believe in that, that have principles.

24:16.259 --> 24:21.206
And understand what this country is all about and what our political system is all about.

24:21.226 --> 24:25.351
Unfortunately, I haven't had to watch my television set in the past four weeks or five weeks or whatever.

24:25.371 --> 24:27.534
I've been campaigning very hard.

24:27.554 --> 24:33.082
And I'm not particularly interested in who the television celebrity is from the moment.

24:33.102 --> 24:36.586
I'm interested in where we're going and what we're doing in this country.

24:36.606 --> 24:41.212
And what is it that guides us?

24:41.233 --> 24:45.338
One of the most conservative principles in the history of mankind

24:45.892 --> 24:49.756
and we've got a configuration, is something called the rule of law.

24:50.216 --> 24:53.480
It is a very conservative principle when you think of it.

24:55.081 --> 24:59.706
The idea that people come together and make laws and agree to be abound by those laws.

25:02.169 --> 25:06.653
And if they don't have to agree with a particular law, they change it only in accordance with the Constitution.

25:08.475 --> 25:10.397
That is something the Athenians gave us.

25:10.838 --> 25:13.300
It's something the founders of this country gave us.

25:13.533 --> 25:18.958
It's something that is embodied in the Constitution, whose 200th anniversary you can celebrate this year.

25:19.499 --> 25:25.425
There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States, and I've read and read that document many times and done it from any new way.

25:25.445 --> 25:28.027
There's nothing in there about 5,000 foreign policy.

25:28.047 --> 25:28.668
Did you notice?

25:29.128 --> 25:29.889
There's nothing in there.

25:29.909 --> 25:32.491
It doesn't say anything about 5,000 foreign policy.

25:32.511 --> 25:35.354
There's no such thing in this country.

25:35.374 --> 25:39.338
The genius of the American political system is that it's open and accountable.

25:40.364 --> 25:47.075
Now, whether we like it or not, it's sometimes kind of uncomfortable for those of us in positions of political leadership.

25:47.095 --> 25:56.470
Everything we do, everything we do, has to be done with an understanding of sooner or later we'll be subject to public scrutiny, and that goes to the people who work for us.

25:57.532 --> 26:03.081
Nobody, my friends, nobody in this country is above the law, not present,

26:17.742 --> 26:20.485
That means all of us are the people who work for us.

26:22.006 --> 26:23.447
All of us are the people who work for us.

26:25.009 --> 26:32.356
Senator Orrin and Hatch, last week, made one of the most interesting statements in American history, I thought.

26:32.376 --> 26:33.097
I don't think you've caught it.

26:33.997 --> 26:38.702
Senator Hatch, you know, has been, I guess he's been apparently investigated.

26:39.483 --> 26:44.287
Senator Hatch said, and I quote, and I think this is almost an accurate quote, an exact quote.

26:45.108 --> 26:47.310
He said, I don't see any reason

26:48.539 --> 26:56.310
why the President of the United States has to be briefed on every important foreign policy issue.

26:56.330 --> 26:59.996
That's what the man says.

27:00.016 --> 27:00.576
He says it.

27:00.657 --> 27:04.322
We haven't heard a statement like that since Senator Foster of Nevada, Joe.

27:04.382 --> 27:07.426
Remember, he said he had a little mediocrity in Supreme Court of the United States.

27:07.446 --> 27:15.598
He doesn't think the President of the United States has to be briefed on every important foreign policy issue.

27:17.281 --> 27:18.242
It's not the kind of guy that I would do.

27:27.858 --> 27:29.179
respect for the Congress.

27:31.221 --> 27:40.891
These are the things that have given us a very special and unique political system.

27:40.911 --> 27:53.043
A system which, by the way, with all of our faults and all of our weaknesses and all of the occasional stumbling we do, is a symbol and an inspiration for people all over this world.

27:53.063 --> 27:53.844
All over this world.

27:53.904 --> 27:56.346
Because these aspirations of human rights and liberty and

27:56.849 --> 27:58.931
pre-expression are not just ours.

27:59.512 --> 28:02.314
They're things that people believe in and aspire to everywhere.

28:03.375 --> 28:07.359
In Latin America, in the Philippines, in South Korea, and yes, in China, the Soviet Union today.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.621
It's a universal aspiration.

28:11.543 --> 28:18.650
And we of the nation, it is our political system that people look to for guidance, for inspiration, for hope.

28:20.652 --> 28:25.877
And that means that not only do we have to be true to those values and principles here at home,

28:26.633 --> 28:30.840
We have to be true to those values and principles all over the world.

28:31.020 --> 28:34.445
Whether it's Central America or in Asia or in the Persian Gulf.

28:35.127 --> 28:39.674
People ask me all the time these days, whether or not I think we ought to put American flags in the way you can't.

28:41.577 --> 28:47.466
Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a war that's been going on in the Persian Gulf for seven years.

28:48.027 --> 28:51.713
Longer than World War II between Iran and Iraq.

28:52.992 --> 29:08.996
And while that war has been going on, for shutting in hundreds of thousands of people killed and maimed and crippled, 13- and 14-year-olds being thrown into that war's handbook, every one of the five permanent members of the U.S.

29:09.016 --> 29:09.837
Security Council

29:10.120 --> 29:13.804
Ourselves, the Soviet Union, the British, the French, and the Chinese.

29:13.824 --> 29:16.087
The five nations who are under the charge of the U.N.

29:16.107 --> 29:20.492
is supposed to have a special responsibility for keeping the peace and stopping conflict.

29:21.273 --> 29:24.697
Every one of those five nations has been selling arms.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.143
We have the Russians' arms and the both sides.

29:30.163 --> 29:36.390
The French, the British, the French in the day field does nothing all day long but run military equipment in Iraqis.

29:36.410 --> 29:38.693
The British is selling spare parts to the Iranians.

29:40.242 --> 29:43.266
under what they say is a contract they had with the Shah.

29:45.108 --> 29:47.311
Now look, I'm a colossal woman.

29:47.752 --> 29:49.855
I'm a great believer in Anglo-Saxon Jurisdurts.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.176
I mean, that's absurd.

29:51.837 --> 29:54.921
And the Chinese have provided about a billion dollars.

29:56.223 --> 30:08.279
These are the five nations who have a special responsibility for stopping conflict and for understanding that conflict anywhere potentially is conflict everywhere.

30:08.299 --> 30:09.861
And that's what we see in the first government.

30:10.853 --> 30:17.239
We don't need American flags.

30:17.399 --> 30:34.756
What we can't is we need a ceasefire, an environmental foreign arms seal, so you want to see more as necessary.

30:34.776 --> 30:37.118
But our responsibility is to stop that war.

30:37.138 --> 30:40.101
That's what I mean when I talk about American flags and American principles.

30:41.026 --> 30:43.770
And about what this nation means.

30:43.790 --> 30:48.017
Means to go to us as parents, changing here, seeking opportunity, seeking the earth and green.

30:49.079 --> 30:57.111
Means to people all over the world, who in their own way, in their own special way, are seeking the kind of things of my parents and your parents.
