WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:04.515
We'll start.

00:04.535 --> 00:06.077
Yes, for the team.

00:06.097 --> 00:07.079
Identify yourself.

00:07.099 --> 00:08.401
Okay, I'm Charles Paul.

00:08.501 --> 00:10.263
I'm the director of the Bancroft Library.

00:10.324 --> 00:17.013
And we're talking here at the Book Fair in San Francisco on September 8, 1996.

00:17.114 --> 00:21.580
And we're talking about the future of libraries.

00:21.740 --> 00:28.350
And I was just saying that at Bancroft, we shouldn't be collecting printed books.

00:28.837 --> 00:39.957
We should be collecting unique archival materials, materials which by definition only exist in one format.

00:39.977 --> 00:42.322
That's actually not so controversial, really.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.325
So you explained it better.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.930
It's a printed book.

00:47.568 --> 00:52.995
Increasingly what's going to happen... But you're talking specifically about the Bancroft Library too, which is very clear.

00:53.035 --> 00:55.698
You're not talking about the university library system by any way.

00:55.738 --> 01:10.116
Well, I think that increasingly that's going to happen with universities because as material becomes digital, it doesn't matter where the physical copy is located because you can get access to it anywhere.

01:11.311 --> 01:22.869
So if there are a thousand copies of a book, what difference does it make whether we have one, or it's at Stanford, or at the Houghton Library?

01:23.690 --> 01:29.539
Once that book has been digitized and made available, then anybody can have access to it.

01:30.380 --> 01:40.657
So we're talking unique items, of course, we would continue to... But we're interested, for example, we have the Mark Twain project.

01:41.418 --> 01:52.236
So instead of looking for every edition of Mark Twain's works that have been published forever, we should be focusing on getting the manuscripts, the originals.

01:52.397 --> 01:54.480
Because if they're lost...

01:54.983 --> 01:56.485
They're gone forever.

01:57.046 --> 01:59.689
How do you feel then about the next step then?

01:59.970 --> 02:05.477
How about printed books that you already have, given an opportunity to digitize what you have?

02:05.497 --> 02:09.443
Would you do that and then take steps to deaccession the printed books?

02:09.563 --> 02:20.738
No, we'll never get rid of them because the book has an actual value that can be very useful for scholarship.

02:20.758 --> 02:24.163
And the problem, of course, is that you never know what...

02:24.886 --> 02:28.696
100 years down the line, someone who's going to be interested in.

02:29.218 --> 02:34.151
But it's a question of where do you have a finite amount of resources.

02:34.653 --> 02:40.228
So do you collect the stuff that everybody else has got, or do you focus on the things that only you can have?

02:40.512 --> 02:46.802
So, just because the Bancroft Library should not be collecting printed books, you do feel that somebody should be?

02:46.822 --> 02:48.104
Somebody should, absolutely.

02:48.925 --> 02:51.910
I mean, our field is basically Western history.

02:51.930 --> 02:56.978
You're talking strictly about, I mean, let's be clear that you're talking about your facility, your institution.

02:56.998 --> 03:01.605
And so, we should be focusing, I think, on collecting materials.

03:01.865 --> 03:06.132
I mean, Hubert Howe Bancroft was the founder of the library since then.

03:06.112 --> 03:07.013
As I have heard.

03:07.033 --> 03:07.935
As you well know.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.677
As I have chronicled.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.039
Thank you.

03:11.259 --> 03:15.025
I love this book.

03:15.145 --> 03:19.932
Almost by definition, there were no antiquary materials about California in the 19th century.

03:19.952 --> 03:26.962
He collected the contemporary materials, because he knew that they were going to be useful not only for his own history, but in the future.

03:26.982 --> 03:30.988
We should be collecting contemporary materials about California.

03:30.968 --> 03:32.069
to make them available.

03:32.110 --> 03:34.292
Such as, can you give me this?

03:34.453 --> 03:42.804
Records of fraternal organizations, businesses, charitable organizations.

03:43.124 --> 03:46.329
We have, I think, the classic is we have the Sierra Club.

03:46.389 --> 03:50.054
So not necessarily literary things by any means.

03:50.074 --> 03:54.099
We do California authors, but we have the Sierra Club audience.

03:54.459 --> 03:56.122
I think that's absolutely wonderful.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.904
I mean, what I would like to see is

03:58.475 --> 04:19.198
also getting the business, especially the Chevron, and trying to look at their point of view about the environmental controversies of the past 30 or 40 years, so that, in fact, people can write about the environmental movement with material from both sides.

04:19.598 --> 04:20.159
That's super.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.200
This is great stuff.

04:21.300 --> 04:26.846
So it isn't a question of, you know, the printed book is going to go away.

04:26.866 --> 04:27.807
It's not going to go away.

04:28.310 --> 04:33.037
Not in my lifetime, not in your lifetime, and not for a long, long time.

04:33.477 --> 04:38.945
But it is, as a source of information, it is going to be replaced by the computer.

04:38.965 --> 04:41.488
And I think that's the general feeling.

04:41.669 --> 04:47.637
For literary works, I think for the foreseeable future, they're going to be in book form.

04:47.657 --> 04:53.305
For scholarship, you want to make information available, and we would love to have

04:54.770 --> 04:59.843
all of our stuff online, so people did not actually have to physically come into the Bancroft Library and use it.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.313
What does it cost you to digitize a page, you know?

05:04.797 --> 05:06.160
You quoted a picture yesterday.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.163
I had a figure of $40.

05:07.363 --> 05:09.008
No, it's not there.

05:09.028 --> 05:10.652
I think $5 would be over-go.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.812
Where did I hear the $40?

05:12.892 --> 05:15.195
Paul LeClaire said $40.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.158
Maybe he was overstating.

05:17.438 --> 05:20.842
Maybe the union's fees are more expensive.

05:21.003 --> 05:23.105
Check with the Yale Open Book Project.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.769
Maybe it was $5.

05:25.949 --> 05:29.634
I said $40.

05:29.714 --> 05:32.337
It's probably somewhere.

05:32.857 --> 05:34.519
It depends on what you're counting.

05:34.559 --> 05:36.482
I'm thinking that maybe it's five.

05:37.343 --> 05:39.467
No, it depends on what you're counting.

05:39.747 --> 05:47.118
I think he's also talking in terms of the money you have to pay for the person that's handling it, and whatever, and time.

05:47.718 --> 05:50.162
I'm going to check it, and I'll let you know if it's 40.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.385
Do you remember the project of the Archive of the Indies in Seville?

05:53.246 --> 05:53.667
No.

05:54.001 --> 06:00.611
They have the largest collection of material on the history of colonial South America.

06:00.772 --> 06:01.433
And this is where?

06:01.533 --> 06:02.334
This is in Seville.

06:02.414 --> 06:02.975
In Spain.

06:02.995 --> 06:03.696
Yeah.

06:03.716 --> 06:05.499
I'm going there for this new book.

06:05.619 --> 06:05.740
Okay.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.626
For my first chapter, it's going to be a survey of libraries through history.

06:09.726 --> 06:12.330
You missed Fernando ColÃ³n.

06:13.812 --> 06:14.393
Okay.

06:14.413 --> 06:15.555
Columbus's son.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.479
He's the one that founded Seville.

06:17.499 --> 06:19.403
He founded the Columbine.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.365
I didn't miss him.

06:20.385 --> 06:21.367
I'm getting him in this book.

06:21.668 --> 06:22.389
Okay, all right.

06:22.409 --> 06:23.992
That's why I'm going to Seville.

06:24.313 --> 06:27.118
Did I mention that before you go?

06:27.479 --> 06:34.032
Before you go, you should talk to my colleague, Arthur Askins, in the Spanish department at Berkeley, who has been working on

06:34.012 --> 06:38.079
This is such a good day.

06:38.119 --> 06:39.282
See, this is going to be a good day.

06:39.322 --> 06:39.843
I'm getting it.

06:40.664 --> 06:41.706
Winner is every one.

06:41.886 --> 06:42.728
Go ahead.

06:42.748 --> 06:44.070
Is that all his name for me, please?

06:44.170 --> 06:45.553
A-S-K-I-N-S.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.394
Okay.

06:46.555 --> 06:50.281
He is an American professor in the Spanish department, a very lively American professor.

06:50.301 --> 06:51.584
So he maintains an office then?

06:51.664 --> 06:58.416
He maintains an office, and he is one of the two or three leading experts on

06:58.598 --> 07:00.260
Fernando Colon and his library.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.022
See, I have to come back out here now.

07:02.042 --> 07:04.345
This is on a trip to the... Now it's becoming serious.

07:04.906 --> 07:15.920
What I'll do is set up this gentleman up in the Sacramento area and see you call the... And the Columbine Library, it's been dispersed.

07:16.281 --> 07:18.924
But it was the largest library in 16th century Europe.

07:18.944 --> 07:19.585
It was larger.

07:19.745 --> 07:23.290
It was a much more important... Why was it dispersed?

07:24.012 --> 07:35.692
Yes, it was sold by the actual librarians who didn't realize the treasure they had.

07:36.072 --> 07:37.996
See the cautionary tales, don't they?

07:38.016 --> 07:45.368
It had, I think, originally something like 16,000 items, and now there are about 4,000 items.

07:45.388 --> 07:48.754
He also could probably tell me who to see when I go over there.

07:48.734 --> 07:52.337
He could probably even give me an introduction to somebody.

07:52.397 --> 07:55.280
Oh, yeah, this opening chapter is going to be wonderful.

07:55.300 --> 08:01.626
I'm going to start in Pergamum, you know, and just come from places where I can go and visit and explain the significance through history.

08:01.646 --> 08:07.852
You know, say, Gaul, and I want to go to this one in Seville, and come right up to this brand-new Bibliotheque National.

08:07.872 --> 08:12.116
It's up in Paris.

08:12.156 --> 08:15.479
That's the continuum, one chapter, and then the two chapters, the future.

08:15.619 --> 08:18.302
But the Archive of the Indies is...

08:18.282 --> 08:19.865
It's right next to the cathedral.

08:19.885 --> 08:24.872
I mean, you can, you know, 100 yards between them.

08:24.892 --> 08:28.278
And they have something like 90 million documents.

08:29.019 --> 08:30.321
And it is the whole history.

08:30.341 --> 08:34.688
I mean, from Columbus all the way up to the Spanish-American War.

08:35.478 --> 08:52.155
And they have started to, you know, for the 1992 business, whether you want to call it Discovery of America or the Encounter of the World or whatever it is, they got the Spanish government... The Discovery in quotes, Joe, isn't it?

08:52.175 --> 08:52.776
The Discovery in quotes, yeah.

08:52.796 --> 09:02.506
They got the Spanish government, IBM, and the largest private foundation in Spain to finance a project to digitize the most important part of the collection.

09:02.526 --> 09:03.527
They have done...

09:03.912 --> 09:06.555
something like 10 million documents digitized.

09:07.536 --> 09:16.065
And now they are available on, only they're on warm drives and they're going to transfer them into regular CD-ROMs.

09:16.645 --> 09:19.168
But they're only still only available in Seville.

09:19.188 --> 09:30.780
And what we're trying to do is set up some sort of relationship so that we can get a section of this material available at Berkeley and put it online.

09:31.267 --> 09:36.514
and they're interested in finding out, you know, is there a object for it?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.156
You're in this new book, you know.

09:38.176 --> 09:39.998
You're in this new book right now.

09:40.238 --> 09:40.719
Great, great.

09:40.839 --> 09:42.721
This is our sharing stuff.

09:42.741 --> 09:48.028
But this is, no, but I mean, I think this is what we see the future for rare book libraries.

09:48.248 --> 09:56.939
What is it that, what is the stuff that we have that people want to use with people coming in, you know, looking at the same stuff over and over again?

09:57.220 --> 10:00.784
Let's digitize it, make it available on the internet so that people can see it

10:00.764 --> 10:03.549
and answer everything.

10:03.569 --> 10:06.393
Some people actually need to look at the physical thing.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.977
Who can argue with that?

10:09.438 --> 10:14.967
Lots and lots of people, all they need to do is look at the text.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.730
That's what we want to try and do.

10:16.750 --> 10:24.122
The stuff that's most fragile and most heavily used, start to put it up on the internet.

10:24.102 --> 10:39.276
Can you think of some really precious object that is being worn to death?

10:39.256 --> 10:42.103
Do you think you can be specific about that?

10:42.484 --> 10:48.237
And be correct, and I'll call you, that really it behooves you to digitize for its own good.

10:48.578 --> 10:50.783
You see what I'm saying?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.868
You don't have to do this off the top of your head either.

10:52.888 --> 10:56.877
The thing that actually comes to mind is not a precious object.

10:57.430 --> 11:01.436
They are the Japanese-American War Relocation Papers.

11:01.456 --> 11:15.979
We have probably the most complete budget in the country, because part of the National Archives, part is in UCLA, and part is here.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.061
of the other parts.

11:17.242 --> 11:24.136
Some of the stuff that was in the National Archives was actually burned, so we have copies.

11:24.156 --> 11:24.818
What file was that?

11:24.958 --> 11:25.279
What happened?

11:25.299 --> 11:32.353
Some of the Japanese-American relocation papers burned in the National Archives.

11:32.794 --> 11:34.137
Are the copies that were there?

11:34.117 --> 12:01.187
We distribute it into the processing, and when the decision was made to provide funds, when the decision was made to provide money to people who were incarcerated, they needed to have information about their personal histories, and that particular information could disperse somehow in the archives.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.051
I don't know about that.

12:03.091 --> 12:08.742
But our set was intact in its original form.

12:08.782 --> 12:14.093
These are very heavily used as teaching tools.

12:14.814 --> 12:19.603
This also feeds in a way to the Sarajevo story that I'm doing.

12:19.623 --> 12:20.425
I'm going to do this.

12:20.405 --> 12:23.529
Too bad some of this stuff wasn't someplace else.

12:23.950 --> 12:27.295
You know, the unique stuff, the archival stuff, the manuscript.

12:27.375 --> 12:37.890
And this project that's being run out of Harvard now, and Russ Middelmeyer, who's trying to help this, you know, they might have been able to find three manuscripts, you know, a lot more.

12:38.225 --> 12:46.357
But they consider this a great, I mean, they've only been able to replicate three from microfiche and stuff that some scholar 20 years ago would have done.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.859
Right, exactly.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.545
But you see how this is all going to work together?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.608
It's going to be a hell of a chapter, don't you think?

12:53.628 --> 12:55.170
I think it's going to be good stuff.

12:55.150 --> 13:00.859
You know, a lot of this stuff in the Japanese is, you know, it's this World War II very flimsy Indian skin paper.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.964
I mean, you look at it and it falls apart.

13:05.106 --> 13:06.308
That's a perfect example.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.013
You see, it doesn't have to be something that's 300 or 400 years old.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.016
It can be something that's 50 years old.

13:11.317 --> 13:19.012
Well, that was a case where different sets of records were made.

13:19.713 --> 13:22.719
One set for the University of California, and one set for the East Coast for the National Archives.

13:22.739 --> 13:29.713
Interestingly, in the Spanish imperial period, when business was being transacted, court cases were being transacted in Mexico, all through New Spain,

13:30.250 --> 13:32.614
multiple sets of those were also made in manuscripts.

13:32.634 --> 13:37.020
So one set was kept at the National Archives in Mexico, or at least ended up there.

13:37.120 --> 13:45.974
Another set was sent back to Seville, and sometimes there were additional sets for various missions and various offices to help them have administrative control.

13:46.034 --> 13:53.625
So there's another case where if one record is lost one place, there may at least be another manuscript copy of that record at another place in Bangkok.

13:54.078 --> 13:59.947
There's still another place where you can go because we would like to call them both at the National Archives.

14:00.027 --> 14:04.033
Similarly, think of all the Army records that were destroyed in that fire out in St.

14:04.113 --> 14:05.134
Louis.

14:05.295 --> 14:08.119
I found this in trying to learn about Haven no more.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.883
All that stuff was reconstructed.

14:10.903 --> 14:13.267
It was two or three little pieces of paper.

14:13.327 --> 14:20.237
Had this stuff been sent place else, duplicate records... Of course, it was...

14:20.656 --> 14:32.233
Traditionally, the way to do this is doing my microfilm.

14:33.275 --> 14:35.759
And it's still probably the cheapest and most efficient.

14:35.779 --> 14:38.864
But it still does mean that you've got to go to the place where that microfilm is kept.

14:38.884 --> 14:41.628
And people are now beginning to look into digitization as a preservation medium.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.091
But it's more than that because it's also access.

14:44.111 --> 14:46.235
Because once it's been digitized, then you can put it up on the Internet and you can make it.

14:46.255 --> 14:46.495
Great stuff.

14:47.048 --> 14:47.956
I'm going to wonder.

14:47.976 --> 14:49.932
I think we've got an interview here.

14:50.235 --> 14:51.102
This turned out to be.

14:52.398 --> 14:57.225
Just quickly identify yourself.

14:57.706 --> 14:59.268
Peter Stern?

14:59.349 --> 15:02.453
I've got athletic fingers.

15:03.034 --> 15:10.285
I don't remember his name, but I think if you call John P. Library, they'll be able to help you out.

15:10.305 --> 15:11.948
I could look it up.

15:11.968 --> 15:15.553
If I could look up his name, I have the appraisal on that file.

15:15.633 --> 15:17.035
I did the appraisal file.

15:17.156 --> 15:19.619
Just for the record of the tape.

15:19.639 --> 15:21.342
Give me your card here.

15:21.322 --> 15:26.548
I like this whole concept of the compulsive.

15:26.949 --> 15:30.233
There was no discretion.

15:30.733 --> 15:33.076
You've got everything you'd get.

15:33.497 --> 15:43.168
If the circus wasn't on, if there were singers, if there were plays, it didn't matter.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.452
Whatever came in entertainment-related,

15:47.242 --> 15:56.874
I think they told me, if I'm not mistaken, his uncle was a booking agent.

15:56.894 --> 16:01.800
And I think his uncle is the one who suggested that maybe he would enjoy doing that as a youngster.

16:01.820 --> 16:02.120
As a youngster.

16:02.140 --> 16:02.441
Probably young.

16:02.461 --> 16:08.027
And he had probably some kind of a mundane job at the Fox department.

16:08.047 --> 16:11.832
But I doubt if he ever, ever,

16:12.132 --> 16:25.129
But I doubt if he did.

16:25.149 --> 16:32.538
He once in a while bought some books that might have gone with a TV series.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.059
Those he probably bought.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.381
There must have been a hundred boxes.

16:34.401 --> 16:35.582
So was he self-sufficient to a living family?

16:35.602 --> 16:36.363
I think he lived with a family.

16:36.383 --> 16:36.944
They took care of him.

16:36.964 --> 16:37.525
And where did he keep going?

16:37.545 --> 16:38.045
In his house, some place.

16:38.065 --> 16:38.586
And so then what happened?

16:38.606 --> 16:39.627
The family gave it to Brown?

16:39.647 --> 16:40.148
No, I thought he gave it.

16:40.718 --> 16:44.004
As an archive, do you think he understood?

16:44.024 --> 16:46.288
I think he understood.

16:46.308 --> 16:48.112
I never met him, though, so I don't know.

16:48.132 --> 16:52.580
There was an article in the paper down there which they would have a copy of.

16:52.600 --> 16:52.820
Okay.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.243
And I think it's pretty remarkable.

16:54.263 --> 17:00.815
And you came in about what point?

17:00.835 --> 17:03.520
Oh, well, so Peter, who came in about what point?

17:03.736 --> 17:05.738
Just to do the phrasing.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.240
When was this?

17:07.480 --> 17:08.641
About a year ago.

17:08.661 --> 17:13.847
See, I didn't hear anything about this.

17:13.987 --> 17:16.570
I told Persella about it.

17:16.590 --> 17:17.651
I told Persella about it.

17:17.671 --> 17:18.392
I told Persella.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.195
I said, you know, this would be a great thing.

17:21.215 --> 17:22.516
It would be a great thing for him.

17:22.536 --> 17:25.059
I thought it would be, or, you know, some kind of thing.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.922
I thought he was working on a new book a year ago.

17:27.942 --> 17:28.162
I decided.

17:28.182 --> 17:29.764
But I am going to have a chapter for people.

17:29.784 --> 17:31.485
But again, you never know how things are going to be used.

17:31.505 --> 17:32.006
So Brown got this.

17:32.046 --> 17:32.967
Well, when did you go to her?

17:32.947 --> 17:35.111
I don't remember.

17:35.131 --> 17:40.781
He didn't have any of probably $35,000 or $50,000.

17:40.801 --> 17:43.426
There was no one thing that really would have listened to.

17:43.446 --> 17:45.630
Yeah, there was no one thing that was tremendous and valuable.

17:45.650 --> 17:46.652
But it's actually pretty precious.

17:46.672 --> 17:47.373
On nice condition?

17:48.475 --> 17:52.161
He might actually be very interested in the interview right now.

17:52.182 --> 17:54.145
Oh, I think it would make peace.
