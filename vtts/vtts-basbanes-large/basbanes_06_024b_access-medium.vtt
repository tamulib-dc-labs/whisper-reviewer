00:02.258 --> 00:10.165
It might work with a book collector, but Morris is too wide to be.

00:11.627 --> 00:13.248
Connie, you ask me a question.

00:13.268 --> 00:15.731
You see those four white binders?

00:16.031 --> 00:19.234
Those are the slides of the stained glass windows from 185.

00:19.914 --> 00:24.078
This is now a project that you and Helen have taken on.

00:25.259 --> 00:25.880
To do what?

00:26.200 --> 00:26.761
For yourself?

00:27.101 --> 00:28.202
Or is this for scholarship?

00:28.222 --> 00:29.123
I'm wondering if I'm curious.

00:29.143 --> 00:31.185
Somebody ought to get a PhD out of it.

00:31.908 --> 00:33.190
Okay.

00:33.210 --> 00:35.413
Maybe you should get a PhD out of it.

00:35.433 --> 00:35.873
No.

00:35.893 --> 00:37.836
Too much writing.

00:37.856 --> 00:40.620
I could just project pictures.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.282
You're making the connections, aren't you?

00:42.342 --> 00:44.265
And actually, it's a work of preservation, isn't it?

00:44.465 --> 00:46.528
There's an urgency to it, isn't there?

00:46.588 --> 00:50.734
There is, indeed.

00:50.754 --> 00:52.817
And you don't know how many of these are Morris's.

00:53.197 --> 00:56.061
Are these churches that you're shooting?

00:56.081 --> 00:57.844
No, I'm talking Morris and Company.

00:57.904 --> 00:58.945
Okay, for sure.

00:59.954 --> 01:04.341
That's a Morris window, even though the figures are designed right where it goes.

01:04.642 --> 01:06.785
For me, that's Morris.

01:07.867 --> 01:11.734
I don't distinguish, but I'm following what he said.

01:11.754 --> 01:17.784
We do not designate who the individual is designing.

01:17.924 --> 01:22.131
Because if Morris didn't approve of it, it wouldn't have been issued.

01:24.946 --> 01:33.197
I'm just wondering, are you a, I hate, I just hesitate to say, a bibliomaniac, but I guess it's more than biblio.

01:33.217 --> 01:44.132
I mean, would you say that it exceeds what non-collecting people might say as a... It's not particularly rational.

01:44.152 --> 01:45.734
...obsessed behavior, right?

01:45.754 --> 01:52.443
It's reached this somewhat irrational level.

01:52.463 --> 01:53.805
Is it possible that you've ever

01:54.072 --> 01:59.198
paid too much for something, but have you ever regretted it, ever regretted anything?

01:59.258 --> 02:01.761
No, my collection, I've invented a word.

02:01.962 --> 02:09.330
I have a collection of shouldas, things I should have offered and didn't.

02:09.391 --> 02:12.514
Those are the ones that I remember vividly.

02:12.534 --> 02:14.497
Like, for instance?

02:14.557 --> 02:14.957
Okay.

02:15.218 --> 02:21.345
See, Morris faced much of his early floral design work

02:22.321 --> 02:27.826
on Gerard's Herbal, I think 1630 or 32.

02:30.068 --> 02:51.687
And I was offered not Morris's copy, but a copy of the same edition, when I'm not sure exactly the date, but it was still pretty much when I was focusing on the Count Scott Press.

02:51.970 --> 02:59.697
$300 in 1968 was notable, and I didn't.

03:01.378 --> 03:08.044
And now that I'm this deep into the decorative arts, it would have been a major piece.

03:08.064 --> 03:10.427
Well, I'm grateful to Dover Publishing.

03:10.507 --> 03:15.852
They did a facsimile in small, didn't they?

03:15.872 --> 03:18.514
But it kicks you off that you don't have anything.

03:18.534 --> 03:18.994
That I don't have.

03:19.014 --> 03:21.977
And now when I see it in the catalog once in a while,

03:23.003 --> 03:28.250
It's up in the $4,000, and I don't care to pay that much.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.131
So there are limits.

03:29.592 --> 03:35.559
Oh, yeah, depending on the importance and where it fits in.

03:35.579 --> 03:36.961
Like an important piece.

03:37.983 --> 03:47.475
See, I got, here's this sub, sub collection.

03:49.143 --> 03:56.994
And Byrne-Jones intended to do an illustrated version of the Cupid and Psyche story from Apuleius.

03:59.137 --> 04:11.554
And Morris, Byrne-Jones did designs, and they were cut in the wood blocks.

04:11.675 --> 04:14.999
Morris did mostly engraving himself, which is from now.

04:15.901 --> 04:19.065
And they went to the best printer in London at the time.

04:19.670 --> 04:28.962
and tried the text, and it was so limp compared to the guts of the woodblocks, they said, no way, and they abandoned it.

04:30.865 --> 04:46.926
Only after Morris had designed the Troy type did they actually set up some, I think, five pages at the Kelmscott Press using

04:53.302 --> 05:19.782
So after they had the Troy type, then you had, let's say, they would both sit on the page happily together.

05:20.588 --> 05:42.791
Now, from those five pages that were set up at the Kelmscott Press, this rampant Lyons press in London got permission from the Cambridge University Press that has all the molds for Morris's Troy type.

05:43.552 --> 05:50.359
They cast enough type to print this, and they extrapolated from those five pages

05:50.643 --> 05:54.108
the whole book that Morris and Byrne Jones intended.

05:54.308 --> 05:55.570
That's nice, isn't it?

05:55.610 --> 05:55.751
Yeah.

05:55.771 --> 05:56.712
This is fabulous.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.294
And when was this done?

05:58.314 --> 06:01.499
This is on the... So it's fairly recent.

06:01.519 --> 06:06.987
Oh, yeah.

06:07.007 --> 06:07.708
Seventy-four.

06:08.209 --> 06:08.890
That's gorgeous.

06:09.631 --> 06:19.165
Now, before this got published, I had gotten a hold of, just like that,

06:20.208 --> 06:27.539
set of proofs, probably a unique set of proofs of the woodblocks.

06:27.559 --> 06:28.841
That's in this book.

06:28.881 --> 06:31.465
That's from Cupid and Psyche, PSYC.

06:32.447 --> 06:34.870
And that triggered my interest in the story.

06:34.890 --> 06:41.480
And before this came out, I started accumulating all the illustrated editions of Cupid and Psyche.

06:41.761 --> 06:42.702
You were well ahead on.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.827
I had all kinds of illustrated.

06:50.566 --> 07:02.807
couple of super things presented themselves, like a book of Byrne Jones drawings for those illustrations.

07:02.827 --> 07:07.415
The original.

07:07.556 --> 07:15.730
And then you want the real trigger is this little thing, which

07:18.393 --> 07:21.056
From the library of William Mars.

07:22.017 --> 07:26.942
This was printed 1567.

07:27.222 --> 07:39.555
And the thing I love is that this just might have stimulated the idea of doing an illustrated version of Cupid and Psyche.

07:40.096 --> 07:42.478
Because here, if you hold that.

07:42.498 --> 07:44.400
This is a book from his library.

07:46.490 --> 08:07.232
in latin telling the story of cupid and psyche is that right right let's see if i can find this let's go okay let's for this is a book i'm holding that's 400 odd years old i should point out 1467 no 1567 yeah

08:15.903 --> 08:18.847
Look at the position of where was the oil lamp.

08:18.927 --> 08:19.548
Oh, absolutely.

08:19.889 --> 08:20.630
Look at that.

08:20.650 --> 08:23.133
Now, is that coincidence?

08:23.153 --> 08:24.415
And it's the same story, too.

08:24.595 --> 08:24.896
Oh, yeah.

08:25.396 --> 08:29.542
Byrne Jones and Morris went home.

08:29.562 --> 08:31.365
That's out of Morris' library.

08:31.505 --> 08:34.609
It's the same story, and there's the illustrations.

08:34.629 --> 08:35.130
Isn't that what it is?

08:35.150 --> 08:37.253
Yeah, it's more than coincidental, isn't it?

08:37.273 --> 08:43.682
So those last two things came after I was deeply into it, so that really put the icing on it.

08:45.923 --> 08:47.105
looking for them.

08:47.826 --> 08:56.698
Well, they just happened to come along and it fits in like I call it coincidence that it was meant to be.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.863
The thing is, you are an artistic person yourself.

09:06.211 --> 09:12.960
So many collectors collect, they say they collect because they feel that

09:13.244 --> 09:17.429
Well, they are not creative, but this allows them to get close to the creative process.

09:18.811 --> 09:19.372
Yeah.

09:19.392 --> 09:24.318
Where you are artistic, where you have... Oh, that's wonderful.

09:24.338 --> 09:25.279
You're going to give us this?

09:25.639 --> 09:25.740
Yeah.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.883
Would you sign it for us?

09:29.344 --> 09:30.405
Yeah.

09:30.425 --> 09:30.526
Oh.

09:30.546 --> 09:36.293
People frame them in there, I think.

09:36.413 --> 09:37.154
No, those are commercial things.

09:37.174 --> 09:40.838
My firm sent them out to clients.

09:40.938 --> 09:41.599
They're beautiful.

09:42.601 --> 09:42.981
You know, like...

09:43.417 --> 09:44.238
Reminders.

09:45.839 --> 09:46.380
Still here?

09:51.364 --> 09:56.469
The villa where Helen was standing on the balcony with the tiara.

09:56.489 --> 10:03.795
That's gorgeous.

10:03.815 --> 10:06.037
I guess this question would really be my last one.

10:06.077 --> 10:11.982
If there's anything else I need, I'll call you.

10:12.002 --> 10:12.883
I guess I was

10:13.167 --> 10:16.834
kind of probing the getting close to the creative process thing.

10:17.455 --> 10:33.864
Those are favorite places.

10:34.525 --> 10:37.150
See, now this is the American church in Rome.

10:38.210 --> 10:40.493
The interior was done by Morris and Company.

10:40.513 --> 10:42.335
This is Byrne Jones' mosaic.

10:42.435 --> 10:56.511
It's beautiful stuff.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.535
Describe the collection.

10:59.555 --> 11:02.058
Oh, you warned somebody.

11:02.078 --> 11:08.065
Well, I heard it described as the most extraordinary collection you'll see on everything to do with William Morris.

11:08.669 --> 11:12.513
It really doesn't, it's really not weak in any area, is it?

11:12.773 --> 11:13.815
No.

11:13.835 --> 11:15.296
I think that's something we should point out.

11:15.797 --> 11:24.166
Realize that whole cabinet over there is all socialist.

11:24.186 --> 11:25.988
Which we haven't even talked about yet.

11:26.228 --> 11:34.557
And for people who specialize in that, they say this is as good as they think.

11:34.837 --> 11:38.541
And these penny

11:39.753 --> 12:07.768
pamphlets were so fragile that to have them all here is it a legacy for you do you think had you had you thought when you started collecting that you would be creating i didn't even remember the preface well i no i didn't know the collection i know that but i'm saying now i'm saying oh now yeah i mean i know i'm not saying that when you ever start i'm saying now i mean when we look at the

12:08.457 --> 12:12.824
The collection in its totality.

12:17.872 --> 12:19.235
What I'm saying is, it is.

12:19.836 --> 12:23.702
We're looking at the Sanford and Hellenberger collection.

12:24.523 --> 12:25.786
That blows my mind.

12:26.206 --> 12:29.652
Oh, I'll tell you what really blew my mind.

12:29.672 --> 12:34.600
When UC had the exhibit at the Art Museum,

12:37.043 --> 12:46.300
For each exhibit on the outside of the building, way up high in big letters, they put the name of the exhibit.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.766
And there was our name, you know, like you see your name on the mark.

12:50.407 --> 12:51.950
That was something.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.533
That was a tingling.

13:01.462 --> 13:04.145
Yeah, I was about to.

13:04.205 --> 13:07.109
Today is the ninth of August.

13:09.792 --> 13:16.660
Yeah, see, it stands up as a high chair, it rolls around, or it lowers down to be a rocker.

13:22.267 --> 13:23.769
This is August.

13:23.789 --> 13:27.193
Yeah, I thought his birthday was Monday, right?

13:27.273 --> 13:28.414
Oh, dear, and you're not there.

13:31.988 --> 13:33.470
No, we will be there.

13:33.490 --> 13:34.010
Oh, you will?

13:34.371 --> 13:39.717
Oh, that's great.

13:39.737 --> 13:41.158
I am impressed.

13:41.238 --> 13:49.828
He told me to say this.

13:49.868 --> 13:52.291
Well, does it look like I want to miss something for you?

13:52.311 --> 13:52.551
Yes.

13:53.312 --> 13:57.056
No, I like what you're asking about.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.359
Thank you.

13:59.379 --> 14:01.101
Those are very important.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.885
whatever they call them.

14:04.905 --> 14:21.466
Well, I'm celebrating the collector, but the, I mean, there was a purpose to end with that question, because that is, that is the legacy, and the legacy goes on, and people will continue to draw from it, and you've made a collection out of things that were everywhere.

14:22.106 --> 14:23.068
Yeah.

14:23.328 --> 14:25.991
I mean, it's the Berger collection now.

14:26.011 --> 14:26.632
Yeah.

14:26.652 --> 14:28.775
You know, and then you can take that away from it.

14:28.795 --> 14:30.497
Okay, you said something earlier.

14:31.777 --> 14:46.350
that I think what you were saying, even though a lot of individual items are not terribly valuable in themselves, their place in the collection gives them a value rate.

14:46.791 --> 14:55.779
And by the same token, when you say shouldas, ones that you shoulda got, the addition or elimination of one item doesn't make or break a collection.

14:55.799 --> 14:56.079
True.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.421
The collection makes the collection.

14:58.441 --> 15:00.163
I asked this question to Michael Kors.

15:01.831 --> 15:27.687
why i'm happy to have facsimiles of things i choose not to afford to buy because for the scholar it's important you be able to read the text or see the facsimile design of this so you have chosen to keep the passion in check i should say i interviewed one man who said who's a very wealthy man today

15:28.308 --> 15:35.778
He said, up until two years ago, a day never went by that I wasn't in debt to one bookseller or another.

15:36.459 --> 15:41.286
I mean, this guy has six, three houses, three houses filled with books and pamphlets.

15:41.426 --> 15:44.029
And he's a wonderful collector.

15:44.730 --> 15:49.217
And he gets the item first, and it doesn't matter what.

15:49.257 --> 15:52.301
See, I never could let myself do that.

15:53.763 --> 15:56.847
As soon as a book arrives, I write the check.

15:57.535 --> 15:59.798
I've never been behind.

16:00.559 --> 16:07.889
But the point is, you know from the beginning, from the get-go, as we say, that you can afford it, that it's not something that you can't afford.

16:07.949 --> 16:09.250
Correct.

16:09.270 --> 16:09.851
Yeah.

16:09.871 --> 16:13.476
I don't let myself order it if I can't pay for it then.

16:13.496 --> 16:17.501
There's nothing that you have to have, whatever the cost.

16:17.521 --> 16:19.684
It was tempting.

16:20.685 --> 16:21.386
Really, what was?

16:21.767 --> 16:24.630
I see, I could have... Yeah, let me zero.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.872
That would be great, thank you.

16:26.982 --> 16:55.453
I forgot to emphasize and didn't mention, but I think it's very important is, as an architect and appreciating the design process, that it is why I particularly wanted to assemble

16:58.319 --> 17:23.164
all the sequence, document all the sequence of events that have to take place from the first concept stage to the preliminary development stage to before you reach the final stage where it's just right.

17:23.184 --> 17:25.727
Because it's so easy to look at a final product.

17:27.023 --> 17:32.469
And it's easy to say, yeah, that's nice, and just walk away from it.

17:32.489 --> 17:42.579
So when you've tried to do it yourself, then it becomes a marvel when you look at that final thing that's just right.

17:42.599 --> 17:47.945
And being able to see all the pieces that go into these things.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.747
That's a major problem.

17:50.767 --> 17:56.153
The design process, beginning to end, sort of prior.

17:56.825 --> 18:02.751
Well, you think he's fully right on the boat if he didn't?

18:02.852 --> 18:06.295
No, we gave up the boat when the kids offered.

18:10.920 --> 18:11.521
We have the boat.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.303
We can put the next page on the back.

18:13.423 --> 18:14.364
And one question.

18:15.245 --> 18:17.828
Do the kids share the enthusiasm for the collection?

18:17.848 --> 18:26.157
Yeah, but when it comes to thinking, I was thinking earlier when you were talking about the Shidee collection, the third generation, and whether

18:26.609 --> 18:28.652
His kids are going to be the fourth generation.

18:29.653 --> 18:34.541
I was thinking about my own, and I'd love it if they did carry it on.

18:35.342 --> 18:47.239
But right now, they're each in the stage of frantically trying to pay off the mortgages and take vacations and just looking forward to having kids.

18:47.259 --> 18:51.005
And they can't begin to think about this.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.490
So maybe if I can survive long enough,

18:56.258 --> 19:02.726
By that time, they might have reached a stage where they could consider continuing.

19:02.746 --> 19:07.553
That could possibly change your mind, then, about what happens to the collective.

19:07.573 --> 19:10.637
Yeah, I think that's a fair state.

19:10.737 --> 19:22.292
But I frankly don't think they can reach that before I run out of time.

19:22.312 --> 19:23.093
You can turn that off.

19:24.929 --> 19:28.332
That's another fantastic story.

19:28.352 --> 19:35.159
These are rubbings of brass monuments from the floor of the Church of St.

19:35.260 --> 19:35.800
Giles.

19:36.901 --> 19:37.262
G-I-L-E-S.

19:37.722 --> 19:39.023
At Great Coxwell.

19:40.004 --> 19:43.428
C-O-X-W-E-L-L.

19:43.448 --> 19:54.379
And it says under the male figure, Here lieth Willem Morris, W-I-L-L-M,

19:55.000 --> 20:00.506
M-O-R-Y-S, sometime farmer of Coxwell.

20:01.828 --> 20:10.458
And under the female figure it says, Here lieth Johane, the wife of Will and Morris.

20:10.478 --> 20:13.962
And Morris' wife's name was Jane.

20:13.982 --> 20:15.683
And these were from 1510.

20:16.024 --> 20:17.566
Can you believe it?

20:18.206 --> 20:24.113
This is a village very near the village of Kelmscott where Morris had his manor.

20:24.329 --> 20:43.555
So he took this flower that's between the feet of the male figure and used it for the watermark for the first Kelmscott Press paper, and he used a leaf design as a paragraph mark for the Kelmscott Press.

20:45.038 --> 20:52.648
I mean, imagine finding the name of you and your wife with the same names from 400 years earlier.

20:53.253 --> 20:57.078
That's really something.

20:57.098 --> 20:58.981
But he took it and made the watermark.

20:59.001 --> 20:59.181
Yeah.

20:59.682 --> 21:01.264
And that leaf he used, too, right?

21:02.826 --> 21:03.086
Right.

21:03.107 --> 21:06.451
That's a great story.

21:07.813 --> 21:09.415
We can't go home, Sandy says.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.817
We want to see something incredible.

21:10.857 --> 21:12.019
And what have we been looking at?

21:12.459 --> 21:17.086
These are Apprentice Tapestry Weaver's trial pieces.

21:19.870 --> 21:20.250
From his?

21:20.270 --> 21:21.752
From Morris Company.

21:21.772 --> 21:22.433
From Morris Company.

21:22.936 --> 21:24.658
Look at that.

21:24.678 --> 21:27.001
Each one is tied separately.

21:27.021 --> 21:42.941
They sit on the back side and look through the warp, the woof, whichever that is, and look at a mirror to see what thing is developing.

21:43.882 --> 21:51.812
But what I was saying about Morris, he left the selection of detailed design of this and selection of the coloring

21:52.484 --> 21:55.027
up to the individual craft.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.693
Did this come with the archives?

22:00.133 --> 22:00.854
Yes.

22:00.874 --> 22:01.835
If it were to you that way.

22:01.855 --> 22:02.136
Yeah.

22:02.536 --> 22:06.761
See, and this was their miniature loom that they would practice on.

22:06.782 --> 22:07.703
This tells about that.

22:08.524 --> 22:09.805
They made everything, didn't they?

22:09.865 --> 22:10.306
Oh, yeah.

22:10.346 --> 22:11.467
To decorate that.

22:11.507 --> 22:12.749
Look at this damask.

22:15.592 --> 22:16.614
Gorgeous.

22:16.634 --> 22:17.675
Look at the swatches.

22:17.695 --> 22:19.437
This mock-up of the carpet.

22:20.935 --> 22:22.437
And they would show these to people?

22:22.657 --> 22:22.777
Sure.

22:23.498 --> 22:24.179
Get approval.

22:24.699 --> 22:25.560
Who basically were they?

22:26.141 --> 22:27.062
Who were their clients?

22:27.082 --> 22:27.402
Rich.

22:34.270 --> 22:38.314
That's Morris designed for a machine-made carpet.

22:38.334 --> 22:41.438
So he tried to accommodate to the less rich.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.440
That's why he developed the wallpaper.

22:44.141 --> 22:47.905
But the way they did wallpaper, it was so labor intensive

22:48.188 --> 22:50.711
Wouldn't we love Morris Wallpaper today?

22:50.811 --> 22:51.531
You can get it.

22:53.554 --> 22:55.716
But it's expensive.

22:55.916 --> 23:05.025
Around every corner is a surprise and a treasure.

23:05.186 --> 23:11.292
Oh, right here.

23:11.692 --> 23:13.354
That was done by his father.

23:15.196 --> 23:17.098
And it was meant for William Randolph Hearst.

23:17.382 --> 23:22.569
Yeah, Morris did a lot of wood carving and stuff as well.

23:23.230 --> 23:27.555
So Morris could have carved this.

23:27.575 --> 23:34.444
But they changed the design so that they... Yeah, this piece was abandoned and he carved another one from the camera.

23:34.464 --> 23:37.568
It had to be longer than whatever.
