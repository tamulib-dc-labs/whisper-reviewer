WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:17.718
Oh, boy, look at that.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.580
It actually has flies in it, huh?

00:20.601 --> 00:21.501
And how old are these?

00:22.082 --> 00:27.086
Well, these are not that old, but this is, ah, this came out of Chicago.

00:27.106 --> 00:28.047
I don't remember.

00:28.067 --> 00:29.409
This flies in it.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.050
Yeah, this is the,

00:36.768 --> 00:37.649
Dairydale.

00:38.210 --> 00:39.411
Well, the Dairydale process.

00:39.431 --> 00:39.732
Right.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.854
This is the toughest one in the Dairydale.

00:42.916 --> 00:44.738
And how do you collect other Dairydales?

00:44.838 --> 00:45.059
No.

00:45.339 --> 00:45.860
No.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.104
I bought this one because I thought it was so unique at the time.

00:49.524 --> 00:50.986
It wasn't very expensive.

00:51.006 --> 00:51.727
1935.

00:51.787 --> 00:54.450
So I had some books on fishing.

00:55.672 --> 00:58.996
And so I bought this thing.

00:59.016 --> 01:02.020
Just because it looked right.

01:02.601 --> 01:03.262
It's beautiful.

01:04.503 --> 01:05.104
On this thing.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.407
You know, it's, what can I say?

01:11.667 --> 01:19.016
You know, everyone has their own little quirks.

01:19.918 --> 01:23.722
And I don't drink, you know what I mean?

01:24.283 --> 01:25.164
And I don't gamble.

01:25.745 --> 01:28.408
I don't play tennis or golf or any of that stuff.

01:29.189 --> 01:34.416
And the college, they never really stressed any of this stuff.

01:35.543 --> 01:42.072
And I always maintained that the professors were dull, dull, dull, right?

01:42.092 --> 01:47.019
And it's so interesting when you could get into it a little bit.

01:48.241 --> 01:56.552
So very interesting that, you know, what really is in the background on all of this stuff, you know what I mean?

01:56.572 --> 02:00.117
This one here is by

02:09.648 --> 02:11.530
Francis O'Brien.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.412
Did you know him up in Portland, Maine?

02:13.432 --> 02:13.652
No.

02:13.672 --> 02:14.994
He just died a few years.

02:15.014 --> 02:19.719
He was a premier book dealer in Maine.

02:19.739 --> 02:20.700
And I met him.

02:20.940 --> 02:21.861
My daughter was up there.

02:22.341 --> 02:25.585
When she first went there, we just took the phone book and started to go around.

02:26.145 --> 02:33.012
Walked into Francis's place, became good, good friends.

02:33.032 --> 02:33.613
I didn't know.

02:33.948 --> 02:36.371
We got the Streeter catalog.

02:36.431 --> 02:38.634
I've got Bradley Martin's Streeter catalog.

02:38.794 --> 02:39.435
I bought that.

02:39.675 --> 02:42.078
I bought that at the sale.

02:42.098 --> 02:42.178
Sam?

02:42.198 --> 02:42.279
Yep.

02:42.299 --> 02:46.544
If you look in American Book Prices Current, that's the one they'll have, and that's the one I bought.

02:46.584 --> 02:51.410
The only thing he didn't have was the index, which I then bought from Bill Reese.

02:52.291 --> 02:55.856
I knew most of these guys at that time.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.780
They were all at Jack Barfield's.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.164
Yeah, well, Decker, that whole group, it was all at Barfield's.

03:02.184 --> 03:02.284
Yeah.

03:02.922 --> 03:05.184
You've got some wonderful bindings here, I have to say.

03:05.324 --> 03:11.850
And, you know, these guys were fascinating.

03:11.870 --> 03:16.073
You know, after the auctions, I'll give you an idea.

03:16.093 --> 03:17.674
You know, Bartfield went heavy.

03:17.855 --> 03:23.780
He was color plate books, bronzes, Western Americans.

03:24.821 --> 03:29.785
We went to an auction once, and they had a couple of great paintings.

03:29.805 --> 03:32.507
You know, at that time, Sotheby's or Park Burnett,

03:32.909 --> 03:39.056
would have a, you know, they'd have a great item, lead up to it, and they'd give you a breather and then another great item.

03:40.037 --> 03:42.019
And so Pete and I were up there.

03:42.779 --> 03:44.661
We don't dress well.

03:44.681 --> 03:45.843
Jack doesn't dress well.

03:46.123 --> 03:49.767
I mean, he all smoked a cigar in the ice.

03:49.787 --> 03:51.589
Pete didn't give a shit about anything.

03:52.029 --> 03:55.253
And I only wore raincoats, right?

03:55.273 --> 04:01.279
And we went into this auction, and Jack always had three seats reserved in the balcony, right?

04:02.221 --> 04:18.621
And we came in, and there were a couple of New York boys, the whole shtick.

04:19.643 --> 04:24.769
And we sit down, one says to the other one, so I can hear, you know, anyone can come into these auctions.

04:26.487 --> 04:27.248
That's right.

04:27.448 --> 04:28.850
It's free entertainment.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.453
I mean, I went to all of them when I was writing my book.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.215
He said, anyone can come in.

04:34.237 --> 04:42.847
So the auction started, and these guys bought a couple of paintings for a couple of thousand, and they thought they were big-time operators, until the first Western came up.

04:43.808 --> 04:52.219
And Jack always used a lead pencil, and he just stood there like that.

04:52.239 --> 04:53.460
Until it was hammered down to him.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.722
Hammered down to Jack.

04:57.824 --> 05:12.600
And then the second lesson came up.

05:13.141 --> 05:15.483
And Jack was there with his number two, like this, see?

05:17.285 --> 05:18.667
And Jack, of course, bought it.

05:19.007 --> 05:20.088
And that's all we were there for.

05:20.148 --> 05:21.229
He said, OK, let's go.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.111
And we walk out.

05:23.512 --> 05:24.633
Now, Jack walks out.

05:24.653 --> 05:26.515
Peter, I turn around to these guys,

05:27.389 --> 05:31.533
I looked at them, they looked at me, and I said, I'm leaving the rest of the dreck to you.

05:33.335 --> 05:38.400
Now, everyone went across the street in a hotel.

05:39.481 --> 05:42.204
Jack Kennedy used to have his room over there.

05:42.264 --> 05:44.807
I forget the name of the damn hotel right now.

05:44.827 --> 05:48.611
And they have this big table reserve for the book dealers, or the art dealers.

05:48.631 --> 05:49.331
They all met there.

05:49.351 --> 05:51.173
Not the Waldorf Astoria, because it's Christie's.

05:51.293 --> 05:52.875
No, no, no, no.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.978
This was, they got it across the street.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.849
They had all the chairs set up.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.231
It was standard.

06:00.972 --> 06:05.998
Every book or art where Jack was involved, that table was reserved.

06:06.018 --> 06:20.534
Came in, and I was an odd man out, and they had to bring an extra chair because everyone sat around the table, but I sat between Jack Bartfield and Peter Kaiserpaar in that little space trying to hear what these guys are all talking about, right?

06:21.075 --> 06:24.919
They're congratulating Jack and everything else and the drinks and everything else.

06:25.388 --> 06:29.594
And I look up, and these two characters are standing out at the door trying to get in.

06:30.715 --> 06:32.558
And the maitre d'ise is full, and I went.

06:34.140 --> 06:40.088
And they like to let anybody in, right?

06:41.330 --> 06:44.975
I wonder who the hell these characters are.

06:44.995 --> 06:48.319
But it used to be an awful lot of fun.

06:48.460 --> 06:52.625
And Tom Clark, who ran the book, I don't know if you want to tell him.

06:52.665 --> 06:53.707
Chinese slow stuff.

06:53.727 --> 06:53.927
Yes.

06:54.177 --> 06:55.279
He was the expert on that.

06:55.439 --> 06:59.224
Tom ran the book department, and he was a book man.

06:59.244 --> 06:59.344
Yeah.

06:59.364 --> 07:00.145
Tom, what was his name?

07:00.165 --> 07:00.466
Clark.

07:01.127 --> 07:03.250
C-L-A-R-K-E, I think it was.

07:04.511 --> 07:04.872
Tom.

07:05.953 --> 07:17.850
And Tom, if I was there, came in with Petey, would take us in fact, he said, this is coming up this month, next month, so forth.

07:18.551 --> 07:22.336
And what was nice about all these fellows, they all took me along.

07:22.737 --> 07:22.817
Hmm.

07:23.523 --> 07:27.047
They educated me, told me what to look for.

07:28.789 --> 07:31.171
You know it enough.

07:31.191 --> 07:32.653
This is what's wrong with this.

07:33.133 --> 07:33.914
This is what's wrong.

07:34.335 --> 07:40.041
Jack used to take me in on bronzes, and he'd say, is that right or is it wrong?

07:41.743 --> 07:44.646
Then he'd say, and I'd say something like this.

07:44.666 --> 07:45.487
You know what he always did?

07:46.548 --> 07:48.630
Wake up.

07:48.751 --> 07:50.072
Wake up.

07:50.092 --> 07:50.993
That's this.

07:51.013 --> 07:51.774
This is this.

07:51.794 --> 07:52.855
This is this, like this.

07:53.324 --> 07:56.587
And then he'd walk over and he'd say, tell me about that one.

07:57.088 --> 08:00.912
I couldn't afford the damn things, but he'd say, tell me about it.

08:02.333 --> 08:02.714
Right?

08:02.734 --> 08:03.895
He did that with his nephew.

08:07.118 --> 08:14.326
He and Rudy Wonderlic went to these Western art museums, and they called out all, and you'd be surprised how many bad things they had.

08:14.526 --> 08:18.370
It takes a real high

08:18.991 --> 08:21.515
And I have books on the fakes.

08:21.615 --> 08:23.418
Remington was faked early on already.

08:24.079 --> 08:24.480
He was?

08:24.840 --> 08:26.042
Oh, yeah, not just recently.

08:26.343 --> 08:27.064
They're getting better.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.989
But Remington was faked back in the 20s already.

08:30.009 --> 08:30.169
Jeez.

08:30.990 --> 08:33.835
So you're into art as much as... Well, I did.

08:34.035 --> 08:34.235
Yeah.

08:34.676 --> 08:35.898
Because I wanted to learn.

08:35.998 --> 08:40.966
And Jack, because he had color play books, he was willing to take the time to teach.

08:42.809 --> 08:43.410
Right?

08:43.650 --> 08:45.353
And only if you handle it,

08:46.598 --> 08:50.343
And this is a bookseller, right?

08:50.383 --> 08:58.913
Jack was known for color plate books, sets, and Western Americana, whether it was bronzes or art.

09:01.096 --> 09:10.847
And Jack probably handled more Audubon, the Elephant Folio, than any other dealer has ever handled, would ever handle again.

09:11.168 --> 09:12.549
How did you get connected with him?

09:12.910 --> 09:15.593
Because he was Peter Kieserkloff's good friend.

09:18.695 --> 09:19.536
And so he taught you.

09:19.616 --> 09:21.758
He was like a mentor in a way.

09:22.138 --> 09:25.221
Fleming, John Fleming used to sit at 4 o'clock when they had drinks.

09:25.962 --> 09:28.525
I had full run of John Fleming's library.

09:28.585 --> 09:32.128
I could walk in at 10 o'clock in the morning, and he'd say, there it is.

09:32.148 --> 09:34.390
She'd go, I will see you later.

09:34.751 --> 09:39.435
I knew Thorne Weldon, which was before she's married.

09:39.956 --> 09:40.697
She's in my book.

09:40.717 --> 09:43.319
She's the only person I don't name, the only source.

09:44.020 --> 09:47.183
She's the one that told me about Michael Davis in Haven or Moore.

09:47.534 --> 09:49.436
at Thornwell and Nice Gal.

09:49.736 --> 09:49.896
Yeah.

09:50.817 --> 09:51.177
I don't know.

09:51.197 --> 09:55.261
She martyred some Romanian who's a metals dealer or something.

09:55.321 --> 09:56.542
She's in London now.

09:56.783 --> 09:59.285
That's where I interviewed her, over in German Street in London.

09:59.505 --> 10:00.386
Back in London again?

10:00.466 --> 10:01.347
They built a house.

10:01.787 --> 10:02.508
Oh, this is back.

10:02.548 --> 10:03.689
I'm talking five, six years ago.

10:03.709 --> 10:06.312
She worked for what dealer?

10:06.532 --> 10:08.374
Oh, it's well in German Street.

10:08.394 --> 10:09.935
No, I still have it here.

10:10.175 --> 10:11.717
I have letters from Thornwell.

10:13.759 --> 10:14.800
What the hell?

10:15.020 --> 10:17.322
He was in botanical things more.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.913
and I just was going through some stuff.

10:23.077 --> 10:24.439
Something in Reed, maybe?

10:24.599 --> 10:25.060
Yeah.

10:27.323 --> 10:28.064
I know.

10:28.084 --> 10:30.007
Do you want me to describe that book over there?

10:30.147 --> 10:33.332
I've got my pen and I'm focused, perhaps.

10:35.255 --> 10:42.125
Technically, that's what everyone will tell you is specialized, focused, specialized.

10:42.145 --> 10:47.072
And as I mentioned to you, at one time I wanted to teach at the library school,

10:48.520 --> 10:54.327
because we had a bookbinding company, you know, general bookbinding, and it's still in existence, but other people are running it.

10:54.347 --> 10:59.654
I mean, I had one hell of a reputation, you know, from here to Stanford.

10:59.714 --> 11:00.255
Sure.

11:00.495 --> 11:04.320
And I wanted to teach the students in the library school.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.362
Where was the school they wanted to teach at?

11:06.743 --> 11:13.211
Oh, they were, Columbia had one, Western Reserve had one, Kent had one, Pittsburgh had one, Chicago had one.

11:13.231 --> 11:14.072
They were all over.

11:14.491 --> 11:20.619
And I wanted to teach them, because none of the librarians knew anything about bookbinding, and it was not a course taught.

11:21.661 --> 11:23.603
They'll teach them the history of bookbinding.

11:23.623 --> 11:24.965
They'll teach them cataloging.

11:25.326 --> 11:29.752
They'll teach them all kinds of things, but they don't teach them bookbinding.

11:29.772 --> 11:40.887
And I wanted to show them what the difference was between a good binding and a bad binding, and why sometimes you want to do this and why you want to do that.

11:41.457 --> 11:44.241
And we did work for the public, the New York public.

11:44.361 --> 11:50.589
John, I haven't seen him in years.

11:51.991 --> 11:58.319
We went there, I did some work, and then another binder came in, and he said, oh, we'll do this free of charge.

11:58.459 --> 11:59.821
And I said to John Baker.

12:00.041 --> 12:00.642
John Baker.

12:00.862 --> 12:01.223
Do you know?

12:01.543 --> 12:02.524
No, but I don't know the name.

12:02.704 --> 12:02.865
Yeah.

12:03.225 --> 12:03.826
John Baker.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.748
I talked to John Baker in New York.

12:05.828 --> 12:06.850
I think he's retired now.

12:06.990 --> 12:07.751
He'll remember me.

12:08.612 --> 12:10.114
Because I said to him, John,

12:11.410 --> 12:11.991
Can't do it.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.152
Impossible.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.956
John says, no, I've got to try him.

12:16.076 --> 12:16.998
I said, that's okay, John.

12:17.058 --> 12:19.020
No hard days.

12:20.062 --> 12:24.448
And I came back, I think about six months later.

12:24.488 --> 12:27.812
I said, John, how are we doing?

12:28.173 --> 12:29.535
He said, I've been waiting for you.

12:31.497 --> 12:32.739
You're going to do all my work again.

12:32.859 --> 12:36.024
I said, did you check what I've been doing?

12:36.044 --> 12:36.664
He says, yes.

12:38.527 --> 12:38.887
Yes.

12:39.749 --> 12:40.810
And I went back.

12:41.617 --> 12:52.813
One time, I was coming through New York, just before John retired, and I went to New York Public, and I went down to the bookbinding department.

12:52.833 --> 12:53.895
Now, I hadn't been there.

12:53.935 --> 12:58.761
Seventy, seventy-four, seventy-three, somewhere in there.

12:59.803 --> 13:02.006
This was eighteen years later.

13:02.947 --> 13:10.358
And I walked in, in the bookbinding department downstairs, and a couple of the gals jumped up and ran over, and they said,

13:12.228 --> 13:13.850
where have you been all these years?

13:14.611 --> 13:15.693
And I said, what do you mean?

13:16.233 --> 13:18.977
Sit down, we want to ask you some questions.

13:20.058 --> 13:23.163
Then they ran over and got on the phone, and John came running down.

13:24.184 --> 13:26.247
And he said, where have you been?

13:27.068 --> 13:27.949
And I said, why?

13:28.029 --> 13:29.631
He said, man, do we miss you?

13:29.671 --> 13:34.357
Because you would sit down, and I would explain to him.

13:34.377 --> 13:37.101
You know, most guys just want to sell and get out.

13:37.241 --> 13:40.125
Now, if you've got a question, and you say to me,

13:40.848 --> 13:43.572
I want to try to do this, what are my options?

13:43.692 --> 13:51.744
I'll sit there, if you're a customer of mine, I'll say, here, you can do this, or you can do this, or you can do this.

13:51.784 --> 13:54.468
You don't want to do that because of this.

13:54.508 --> 13:55.950
You don't want to do that because of this.

13:55.970 --> 13:57.352
You don't want to do this because of this.

13:58.073 --> 14:00.637
And you say to them, here's where you are, right?

14:01.398 --> 14:04.563
And most people appreciate that.

14:04.583 --> 14:04.883
Sure.

14:05.424 --> 14:05.685
Right?

14:06.466 --> 14:08.329
Because you have to teach them.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.011
They want to learn.

14:11.003 --> 14:14.528
Most guys don't either know it or they want to keep running.

14:14.689 --> 14:16.892
They've got to make the next step.

14:16.912 --> 14:17.994
Time is money.

14:18.014 --> 14:18.795
That's what they all say.

14:18.875 --> 14:25.245
But time is money if you're doing the running.

14:25.666 --> 14:29.191
But if you want a question answered, your time is not money.

14:29.772 --> 14:30.834
I want that answer.

14:30.874 --> 14:34.499
It's only when it's on my foot.

14:34.519 --> 14:36.222
But they don't worry about the other guy.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.407
And we all have to.

14:39.556 --> 14:41.138
You know it as well as I do.

14:41.579 --> 14:42.740
People have to teach you.

14:44.283 --> 14:53.355
You can read all these goddamn books unless you've got a photographing memory until you actually handle it and somebody starts to tell you.

14:57.842 --> 14:58.863
You've got to handle the goods.

14:58.943 --> 15:01.487
You've got to handle the goods and somebody has to explain to you.

15:02.128 --> 15:03.730
You can handle these books.

15:04.551 --> 15:06.394
And you say, oh, this is a great copy.

15:06.594 --> 15:07.475
This is a great copy.

15:07.495 --> 15:08.196
I say, fine, take it.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.586
Then you say to yourself, why the hell is this so dangerous?

15:12.047 --> 15:13.789
This has got to be the best copy.

15:14.289 --> 15:14.570
Sure.

15:15.330 --> 15:18.314
And then you look at it and you say, why did you let me take that one?

15:18.354 --> 15:19.895
Why didn't you take that one?

15:21.377 --> 15:22.538
Oh, now you want to know.

15:23.099 --> 15:24.501
Now I will explain it to you.

15:25.462 --> 15:28.946
Why, this one is better than the one you grabbed.

15:28.966 --> 15:30.327
Even though this one may look better.

15:30.608 --> 15:31.228
May look better.

15:31.248 --> 15:32.209
It's maybe not better.

15:33.871 --> 15:34.652
You have to.

15:35.213 --> 15:36.374
Somebody has to teach you.

15:36.734 --> 15:37.255
I don't know.

15:37.572 --> 15:49.792
I don't remember what your profession was, but somebody taught you, and they had to carry you along and revise and revise and revise and say, hey, you don't want to say it this way.

15:49.812 --> 15:50.974
Try it this way.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.076
Maybe it'll sound better.

15:53.037 --> 15:55.882
Somebody had to work with you.

15:55.982 --> 15:58.366
If they don't work with you, you'll feel it.

15:58.386 --> 15:59.388
I do a lot of photography.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.892
You have to work with a pro.

16:02.159 --> 16:04.642
of somebody that's really going to teach you the tricks.

16:04.903 --> 16:05.183
Right.

16:06.645 --> 16:09.368
And that's what I believe when we did book running.

16:09.388 --> 16:17.699
I'd rather make one call in the morning and one call in the afternoon, a good call, to teach the people something, because I figured if they talk, they talk.

16:18.200 --> 16:27.171
You know, the first thing you said to me today, and I always like to come back to where I started, is that, you know, when everything is said and done, when the scorecards are tallied,

16:27.877 --> 16:31.302
you want to be identified and remembered as a book buyer.

16:31.322 --> 16:31.502
Oh, yeah.

16:31.863 --> 16:32.103
Oh, yeah.

16:32.764 --> 16:34.706
So, I mean, so you are a book man.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.429
I'm a book buyer.

16:36.449 --> 16:40.995
I don't want to, I don't, don't tell me I was a machinist making nuclear parts for the submarines.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.718
I don't give a damn about that.

16:43.599 --> 16:45.541
I'm making, I'm in injection molding now.

16:45.561 --> 16:46.683
I don't give a damn about that.

16:46.703 --> 16:48.165
I have my dad's folder yet.

16:48.185 --> 16:49.968
When he died, I took it out of his pocket.

16:51.009 --> 16:51.209
Uh-huh.

16:51.229 --> 16:54.614
And I said to him, and don't you ever touch it.

16:54.634 --> 16:55.335
I have his scissors.

16:56.497 --> 17:06.591
I'm really impressed with how neat you are, how ordered you are.

17:08.273 --> 17:09.675
This is a disaster.

17:09.695 --> 17:16.504
This is the worst you... Well, this is because everything gets thrown in here at night.

17:21.150 --> 17:25.356
I'm getting family history and my dad's folder.

17:26.247 --> 17:27.669
Now, his folder, you don't have to.

17:27.729 --> 17:28.830
You can just tell me what it is.

17:29.171 --> 17:31.954
You know, the book finder has a bone folder.

17:33.076 --> 17:33.897
Here's the scissors.

17:33.957 --> 17:38.343
Now, you look at this pair of scissors, you say, this is an atrocious pair of scissors.

17:39.524 --> 17:44.691
But this scissors, I can cut a 64th of an inch on a piece of paper.

17:44.711 --> 17:45.532
What a wonderful book.

17:47.034 --> 17:48.656
Now, his folder's got to be back.

17:48.876 --> 17:52.080
My wife took it out of here.

17:52.261 --> 17:54.043
She's dead.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.332
You know, what's that?

17:59.532 --> 18:00.893
That's a pipe.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.414
Your father's?

18:02.015 --> 18:06.680
No, I got Indian, Western.

18:08.722 --> 18:10.544
You love this Indian stuff I can see.

18:15.089 --> 18:21.116
I'm sure you want another one down there.

18:21.136 --> 18:23.659
I'm sure you've got the thing safe someplace.

18:24.955 --> 18:33.723
a match thing from World War I. But those are his scissors right there.

18:33.743 --> 18:40.489
They look a little loose, actually, but I guess... But you can't duplicate that pair of scissors.

18:40.509 --> 18:44.453
I mean, and I can cut paper like you wouldn't believe.

18:44.934 --> 18:54.102
I'll be back looking so hot tonight.

18:54.908 --> 18:59.475
Because that is a—this is for McCrea.

18:59.495 --> 19:07.086
This is one of those—I don't know if you saw from, you know, these A-frames that the gooks used to wear, sorry?

19:08.809 --> 19:09.570
Oh, yeah.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.695
Yeah.

19:12.715 --> 19:13.376
What the hell is it?

19:13.396 --> 19:13.736
What is it?

19:14.397 --> 19:14.858
What does it do?

19:14.878 --> 19:15.299
This is brass.

19:15.319 --> 19:22.249
You know, the gooks over there used to steal the brass journals out of the railroad cars.

19:23.090 --> 19:23.430
Right.

19:23.450 --> 19:27.755
They'd take the whole damn thing, you know, that block that you had the axle fighting on.

19:27.775 --> 19:34.543
They'd steal that out, right, and then make stuff like this out of it.

19:34.563 --> 19:38.068
It doesn't bother me, because that was always in there for years.

19:39.269 --> 19:39.930
You'll find it.

19:39.950 --> 19:41.091
I'm sure you put it someplace safe.

19:41.151 --> 19:42.533
I do the same thing all the time.

19:43.134 --> 19:49.261
But, um, there's three of us.

19:49.281 --> 19:51.223
We fill the troops and fill the trains.

19:52.503 --> 19:53.764
Sending it north.

19:53.784 --> 19:55.185
Train never arrived.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.548
The whole goddamn train disappeared.

19:58.168 --> 20:00.090
Just disappeared off the face of the earth, right?

20:00.230 --> 20:00.791
Disappeared.

20:02.252 --> 20:03.693
Gone.

20:03.713 --> 20:05.855
So we sent helicopters up right away.

20:06.876 --> 20:09.419
Couldn't find the gun.

20:09.439 --> 20:11.140
We had troops walking it.

20:11.561 --> 20:12.321
Couldn't find it.

20:13.843 --> 20:19.708
Weird day, one pilot who was sharpening with his observer saw a yellow line in the ground.

20:21.038 --> 20:22.981
So we sent some troops up real quick.

20:24.002 --> 20:31.013
And here the gooks had taken this damn train, put a switch in, and taken it into an old Jap cave.

20:31.033 --> 20:31.914
Jeez.

20:31.934 --> 20:32.615
Right?

20:32.635 --> 20:33.597
Stripping it down.

20:33.697 --> 20:36.381
Stripped the food and everything else out of it.

20:36.521 --> 20:37.242
We kept checking.

20:37.262 --> 20:41.809
We found there were an American sergeant and an American officer involved, rotating home.

20:41.829 --> 20:42.751
They were on the boat home.

20:44.393 --> 20:45.094
They landed.

20:45.134 --> 20:46.757
They were on the plunked back.

20:47.698 --> 20:47.778
Wow.

20:47.798 --> 20:48.379
Court-martialed.

20:49.540 --> 20:49.940
Right.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.943
This is black marketeering and stuff, right?

20:52.543 --> 20:53.044
Big time.

20:53.164 --> 20:53.605
Big time.

20:54.325 --> 20:55.547
So they diverted the train?

20:55.987 --> 20:57.329
They were in coots with these gooks.

20:57.589 --> 20:57.669
Wow.

20:57.689 --> 20:58.830
Diverted the all goddamn train.

20:59.431 --> 21:01.033
Jesus.

21:01.834 --> 21:06.599
Take a couple of hospital cars, you know, big train things off of a boat.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.441
Put them in on the tracks.

21:08.982 --> 21:09.963
Next morning they were gone.

21:11.424 --> 21:12.926
The Koreans?

21:12.946 --> 21:13.467
Oh, Koreans.

21:14.728 --> 21:18.332
You never, never.

21:18.852 --> 21:22.096
I was in Vietnam, and you didn't know which one was the north or the south.

21:22.116 --> 21:24.498
They were all the same as far as we were concerned, you know.

21:26.360 --> 21:33.829
The Koreans, I mean, 45, I'd be in Los Angeles, they said, curious, right?

21:34.029 --> 21:39.835
All the sergeant and I always walked together, and we were right on the waterfront, kind of thing.

21:39.855 --> 21:43.800
I mean, we had never got as close as you did to me before I got banged.

21:46.122 --> 21:46.783
You didn't trust them?

21:47.978 --> 21:52.302
All you can make is one mistake, and that's it.
