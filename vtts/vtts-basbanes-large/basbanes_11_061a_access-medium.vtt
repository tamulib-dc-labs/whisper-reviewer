00:02.765 --> 00:04.367
Some of the Burroughs archives.

00:04.387 --> 00:05.709
Okay, Bob Jackson.

00:05.749 --> 00:12.999
And this is the Naked Lunch manuscript.

00:13.019 --> 00:14.521
That's pretty good.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.524
When did you start acquiring Burroughs?

00:16.725 --> 00:21.792
Through Brad Murrow, about 10 years ago.

00:22.292 --> 00:24.275
I mean, was it largely because it was available?

00:24.395 --> 00:25.577
It just struck me.

00:25.597 --> 00:29.222
I mean, I don't collect beat generation, although it's my era.

00:29.242 --> 00:32.046
And these are the Paul Bowles letters that are unpublished.

00:32.802 --> 00:33.944
All this is unpublished.

00:34.745 --> 00:38.511
This is the important archive.

00:39.172 --> 00:42.277
This is only part of it.

00:42.437 --> 00:46.223
It's a half a ton of material.

00:47.305 --> 00:49.909
A half a ton, literally?

00:50.410 --> 00:51.131
Upstairs.

00:51.892 --> 00:56.640
Wow.

00:56.660 --> 01:00.025
This is for an exhibition, but all this is...

01:03.481 --> 01:08.048
Is it good substantive stuff?

01:08.568 --> 01:13.616
Ted Morgan and I have said there are three books here.

01:13.936 --> 01:16.300
Viking Press has written to me.

01:16.720 --> 01:29.539
They did a first book on letters by Burroughs, and they want to do a second book, but they can't do it because I have all the material, and I haven't let them publish it because I want to sell it to an institution.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.741
And then they can do it.

01:30.821 --> 01:33.826
But once I publish it myself, then this is in value.

01:33.846 --> 01:34.847
This is tremendously.

01:35.087 --> 01:44.100
So when Ted Morgan was here, he said that there's at least three books, maybe four out of what I have.

01:44.200 --> 01:44.581
Really?

01:45.101 --> 01:46.043
That was his judgment.

01:47.244 --> 01:49.047
Did Ted come to see this stuff?

01:49.147 --> 01:50.749
Oh, yeah.

01:50.769 --> 01:51.751
What was he working on?

01:51.771 --> 01:54.995
Well, here.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.337
This is the book he wrote.

02:01.835 --> 02:02.596
My publisher.

02:04.598 --> 02:05.660
He had the same house here.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.124
I wonder who his editor was in this.

02:09.164 --> 02:11.007
I don't know.

02:11.027 --> 02:12.909
He's really moved around from house to house.

02:13.189 --> 02:15.012
Yeah, I have a number of books here.

02:15.112 --> 02:16.233
Putnam and Mara.

02:16.253 --> 02:18.536
My mom is, is this in 1988?

02:18.896 --> 02:29.390
Yes, and that's, and then he did mention me in here, but I wasn't.

02:29.410 --> 02:29.510
Yeah.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.352
Just I think I really wish he had it, but.

02:33.593 --> 02:36.156
The dealer put ASU in touch of the cover.

02:50.450 --> 02:51.912
How did Ted find out about you?

02:51.932 --> 02:52.713
He just found it.

02:52.733 --> 02:58.779
Well, through Brad Morrow and through Burrell's program, I had this material.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.862
And this is the famous.

03:02.230 --> 03:08.456
It was sold by Burroughs and Geisen to this Lichtenstein Swiss banker who sold it.

03:08.936 --> 03:11.338
He kept it for 15 years and he sold it to me.

03:12.099 --> 03:14.561
It was a lot of intrigue and money transferring.

03:14.601 --> 03:17.704
I had to go to Paris and Morrow went to Lichtenstein.

03:18.645 --> 03:23.310
And while there, there's a sequel to the book Junkie called Queer.

03:23.950 --> 03:24.751
I know that book.

03:24.771 --> 03:24.871
What?

03:24.991 --> 03:25.712
I know that book.

03:25.852 --> 03:27.273
Well, no one had ever seen it before.

03:27.814 --> 03:29.155
I mean, I know of it.

03:29.275 --> 03:29.916
I've not read it.

03:30.156 --> 03:31.377
I know of manuscripts.

03:32.285 --> 03:35.950
And what happened was that they, Greerholz, who was the secretary.

03:37.833 --> 03:38.274
Who was it?

03:38.955 --> 03:40.016
Jim Greerholz, I see.

03:40.297 --> 03:47.487
Took the manuscript, this is the manuscript, from 1950s, and copied it.

03:48.268 --> 03:53.836
And when I found about it, I threatened to sue him, and I said, you can't publish the book.

03:54.777 --> 03:55.799
Because you're the owner of it.

03:55.819 --> 03:56.500
I'm the owner of it.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.165
So what happened is that they said, well, we'll dedicate the book to you.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.193
And I said, no, I don't want the book.

04:03.213 --> 04:04.534
They're dedicated to me.

04:05.395 --> 04:07.918
So what they did do was to get the book.

04:07.938 --> 04:08.900
That's pretty interesting.

04:10.622 --> 04:12.544
Well, there's been a big crack about that.

04:13.605 --> 04:21.315
And I was sort of going to sue them because they stole the material.

04:21.976 --> 04:25.040
And you had the full title to it?

04:25.060 --> 04:25.781
I found out about it accidentally.

04:26.682 --> 04:31.047
So I then took, I said to them I was going to sue them for...

04:31.246 --> 04:32.007
what they did.

04:33.308 --> 04:37.053
And then he said, okay, we will, you will dedicate the book to you.

04:37.073 --> 04:40.096
I said, no, I won't, except I can't have queer dedications.

04:40.116 --> 04:40.717
Of course not.

04:41.498 --> 04:45.062
But I want all the material and the brown prints and the correspondence.

04:45.242 --> 04:47.385
And then they said, well, we'll do this.

04:47.425 --> 04:55.835
So they, with grateful acknowledgement of the kind collaboration of Robert H. Jackson and for his aid in the production of this book.

04:56.496 --> 05:00.240
So I did do it because- And what year is the publication of this?

05:01.182 --> 05:01.923
1985.

05:02.944 --> 05:05.287
So it's time passes, doesn't it, huh?

05:05.707 --> 05:06.228
Yeah, right.

05:06.248 --> 05:07.950
I remember when that came on.

05:08.070 --> 05:14.337
So I'm responsible for this book, but then... Could you stop publication if you wanted to?

05:14.357 --> 05:26.891
You know, it was not a question in my mind, because first of all, being a lawyer, and then what happened, so Vauerholtz, you know, I was angry, but I didn't want the money.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.994
I wasn't interested in the money.

05:29.014 --> 05:30.295
It was just the whole concept of it.

05:30.697 --> 05:34.502
So there was a book published a few years later.

05:34.562 --> 05:41.292
Talk about me in here.

05:42.514 --> 05:47.220
Are you on the index?

05:47.681 --> 05:51.406
No, no, he wouldn't mention it.

05:51.426 --> 05:52.147
Whose book is this?

05:52.328 --> 05:55.672
This is a set of Interzone, that's what it's called.

05:55.933 --> 05:56.113
Yeah.

05:57.832 --> 06:01.057
But he talked about me here, and I was furious.

06:01.137 --> 06:05.343
James, G-R-A-U-E-R-H-O-L-Z.

06:06.265 --> 06:11.553
And what is he, one of the scholars of... He was a secretary.

06:12.013 --> 06:12.634
Oh, I see.

06:12.674 --> 06:14.898
And all that stuff.

06:17.301 --> 06:19.024
Don't you think he'd call me difficult?

06:19.044 --> 06:20.466
He said it was a private collector.

06:23.651 --> 06:24.572
Difficult?

06:24.593 --> 06:25.233
Right.

06:25.254 --> 06:25.594
He said,

06:28.747 --> 06:29.468
What should be here?

06:29.548 --> 06:39.499
Somewhere there's a... There's a reference to... There's a reference to me.

06:39.579 --> 06:41.041
To a difficult collector, right?

06:41.081 --> 06:43.623
A difficult collector.

06:43.643 --> 06:45.365
And this is in Interzone.

06:45.465 --> 06:46.266
Interzone.

06:49.390 --> 06:56.818
I mean, you get a bookmark in there for next time, so you should... But anyway, but so, you know, I have a lot of... So finally I let him do it.

06:57.659 --> 06:57.859
But...

06:58.042 --> 07:04.830
You know, there's a lot of history, and then ever since that, Graerholtz won't talk to me, and I've been ambivalent about talking to him.

07:05.270 --> 07:10.276
Meantime, Spurro's the one who suffered through this.

07:10.296 --> 07:13.219
How did you find out that they were about to publish this thing?

07:13.820 --> 07:22.970
Marl was telling me in a side conversation, Graerholtz said something to me on the telephone, because they wanted to publish all this material, this wealth of material.

07:23.971 --> 07:27.795
And I said, well, I'm not sure I want to publish it,

07:28.028 --> 07:30.172
He looked to me by and said, well, we're doing queer now.

07:30.613 --> 07:31.975
I said, what do you mean you're doing queer?

07:32.977 --> 07:34.039
I said, you have no rights to do it.

07:34.059 --> 07:35.141
He said, well, how did you do it?

07:35.181 --> 07:40.150
He said, well, Brent Merle told me that he borrowed the manuscript and Liechtenstein made it.

07:40.170 --> 07:41.673
And did you contact the publisher?

07:41.833 --> 07:43.016
No, I didn't have to.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.078
That's all you'd have to do.

07:44.258 --> 07:45.139
They were afraid of me.

07:45.721 --> 07:47.083
I mean, they knew there was a lot of help.

07:47.165 --> 07:49.409
I would exercise my right.

07:49.429 --> 07:50.531
You know, they would do a very dumb thing.

07:50.711 --> 07:53.215
Yeah, but a publisher will back off in five seconds.

07:53.275 --> 07:53.997
Sure.

07:54.017 --> 07:56.641
And in this case, I mean, I had gross sales.

07:56.661 --> 07:58.104
All they needed is a hint.

07:58.424 --> 07:58.705
Right.

07:58.725 --> 07:59.826
And that deal was scorched.

08:00.167 --> 08:00.287
Right.

08:00.608 --> 08:01.149
Instantly.

08:01.469 --> 08:02.010
Yeah.

08:02.030 --> 08:02.311
Yeah.

08:03.392 --> 08:04.154
So it was okay.

08:04.174 --> 08:08.742
I mean, I got my comeuppance, you know.

08:08.782 --> 08:09.924
They had to satisfy you.

08:10.164 --> 08:11.646
Yeah, right.

08:11.666 --> 08:13.189
And what was satisfaction for you?

08:14.030 --> 08:38.176
I got an acknowledgment, which wasn't important, but they gave me all the manuscript material and all the publications, so I have an example of a book that was famous for its never being published, and so I have this manuscript and the brown prints and the correspondence, and they gave me everything, and that was my painting.

08:38.196 --> 08:42.400
Which is nice, which as a collector is wonderful.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.229
Didn't meant to start out that way.

08:44.249 --> 08:44.429
Yeah.

08:46.511 --> 08:47.292
Well, that's pretty good.

08:47.312 --> 08:48.554
I was happy.

08:48.574 --> 08:50.676
Yeah, that's cool.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.459
Anyway.

08:53.479 --> 08:55.302
Well, see, it's interesting.

08:55.322 --> 08:56.543
You have a lot of different things.

08:56.963 --> 08:59.887
And you probably never thought you'd collect manuscripts, right?

09:00.668 --> 09:05.774
No, but I'm probably, in one way, somewhat very active manuscript collector.

09:06.234 --> 09:07.916
But not focused on it.

09:07.936 --> 09:10.599
I just can buy what I enjoy.

09:10.619 --> 09:11.340
You can carry it.

09:11.658 --> 09:16.322
I am getting tired, I have to confess, I'm losing my focus here.

09:17.183 --> 09:17.843
Let's start again.

09:18.304 --> 09:26.291
We're in now, this is this guy's, this is an interzone, borrows his book, and this former secretary, his name is?

09:26.451 --> 09:27.372
Still the secretary.

09:27.712 --> 09:28.493
Still the secretary.

09:28.513 --> 09:29.234
James Brouwer-Holtz.

09:29.254 --> 09:33.617
Okay, and he, and he, what page on the introduction are you on?

09:33.718 --> 09:34.338
Page 14.

09:34.818 --> 09:35.539
Okay.

09:35.599 --> 09:39.943
World papers have had a harrowing voyage to the hands of today's scholars.

09:40.430 --> 09:49.485
What is from a period mostly comp friend, mostly at least research center of the University of Texas, the author's own collection, is jumbled and incomplete.

09:49.705 --> 09:54.293
Many other manuscripts remain in uncooperative, private hands at this rate.

09:54.954 --> 09:57.558
And he won't play ball according to this guy's rules.

09:57.578 --> 09:58.339
Right, right.

09:58.379 --> 09:59.361
So he's got his dig in.

10:00.002 --> 10:01.324
Come on in.
