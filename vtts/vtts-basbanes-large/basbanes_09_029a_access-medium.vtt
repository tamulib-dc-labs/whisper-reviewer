00:02.680 --> 00:12.596
When you think about it, it's not a departure.

00:12.616 --> 00:20.749
You know, all my books, all my work is about power, the use of power, the abuse of power.

00:22.551 --> 00:30.544
The first Watergate book, All the President's Men, it's really about the power of the press.

00:32.009 --> 00:37.836
So it's about Bob and me, and about presidential power.

00:37.856 --> 00:42.642
The Final Days, obviously, is about the abuse of power.

00:42.862 --> 00:52.093
The memoir, Loyalties, is really about the McCarthy era and the abuse of power.

00:52.474 --> 01:01.645
This book is about the great event of our era, which is the fall of communism.

01:01.827 --> 01:24.325
and the use of power i mean there's there's certainly dogmatic power that this pope exercises there's certainly uh repressive power within the institution uh that he uses uh some people would say that he abuses his power

01:24.305 --> 01:28.970
in terms of women, in terms of descent in the church.

01:30.332 --> 01:31.793
You can certainly make that argument.

01:32.094 --> 01:42.285
But this is really about the most, you know, the great event of our time in this country was Watergate.

01:44.547 --> 01:49.873
The great event in our time, historically, period,

01:50.343 --> 01:51.726
is the fall of communism.

01:51.786 --> 01:58.458
And there's no way to understand the fall of communism until now, until this book, actually.

01:58.538 --> 02:02.806
I think there's been this huge piece of the puzzle missing, which was the role of the Pope.

02:03.868 --> 02:08.376
You don't mind this right here?

02:08.396 --> 02:08.476
No.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.501
It's going to make it a lot easier.

02:11.521 --> 02:11.862
No.

02:12.128 --> 02:14.173
Not a bit.

02:14.193 --> 02:15.096
Yeah, we're ready.

02:15.316 --> 02:17.903
Now we start to understand the role of the Pope.

02:18.965 --> 02:24.239
And of Reagan, and the two of them working along parallel lines.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.412
So you're working for ABC Pacific.

02:29.898 --> 02:32.761
have some international experience.

02:32.841 --> 02:38.147
I guess that explains why you took on a collaborator for this book.

02:38.768 --> 02:41.571
Let me give you the history of the book.

02:41.812 --> 02:50.882
I did a cover story for Time magazine saying that Pope and Reagan had collaborated secretly to keep solidarity alive in Boston.

02:51.883 --> 02:55.467
Wake me up.

02:55.447 --> 03:04.922
Keep solidarity alive in Poland.

03:04.943 --> 03:07.427
And this was the great turning point in the Cold War.

03:09.129 --> 03:10.772
I then was asked,

03:10.938 --> 03:15.466
by Doubleday, actually, turns out, to do a book on Reagan and the Pope.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.149
And I said, no, I've done the story.

03:17.189 --> 03:17.810
That's that.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.493
It took me a year to do the story.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.717
It was a huge undertaking.

03:21.737 --> 03:23.360
It's been an undertaking for a magazine.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.826
It's been a year and a hard read for jumping in on that.

03:26.947 --> 03:28.349
No, it was close to a year.

03:28.389 --> 03:32.156
And, you know, it was a very difficult story.

03:33.138 --> 03:35.562
But then, to my amazement, Gorbachev,

03:35.980 --> 03:40.881
wrote a response to my story two weeks later in La Stampa.

03:40.901 --> 03:43.392
Yes.

03:44.502 --> 03:55.372
So to my amazement, Gorbachev wrote a response in La Stampa that the New York Times ran, saying, yes, and without this pope, none of the events in Eastern Europe would have occurred.

03:56.233 --> 03:56.894
It's amazing.

03:56.914 --> 03:57.194
It is.

03:57.334 --> 04:08.705
And at that point, I said to myself, I know, you know, you write a story and you hope, well, maybe the Vatican will react, maybe the president will react, maybe it doesn't get your attention, doesn't it?

04:08.725 --> 04:10.847
And I said to myself, you know,

04:10.827 --> 04:14.994
This story is an even bigger story than I thought.

04:15.895 --> 04:25.711
So at that point, and meanwhile, the Pope in the post-communist era particularly had taken on the whole of conventional Western morality.

04:26.872 --> 04:30.358
So I said, this man, this is the great story of our time.

04:31.239 --> 04:38.050
And if anybody would have told me 25 years ago that at the end of the century, the Pope of Rome was the great...

04:38.688 --> 04:43.015
world leader, I would have said, you're smoking something.

04:43.696 --> 05:05.370
But obviously, I lack the knowledge of the Vatican and of church history to put my reporting into the context if I'm going to do a biography of a pope.

05:05.755 --> 05:16.292
I need to have someone around me who understands church history and understands the Vatican as an institution, and that has studied it for years and years.

05:16.993 --> 05:29.653
So I went looking for a collaborator who had such a background, and I decided that the best of the Vatican journalists was Marco Politi, then of Messaggero.

05:30.140 --> 05:37.007
who also had covered the Soviet Union for five years, which was perfect.

05:37.027 --> 05:51.962
And so he is able to supplement my reporting and bring a dimension to interpretively, particularly, the book just never could have had otherwise.

05:51.982 --> 05:57.548
I would say access to sources to... To some extent, though surprisingly enough,

05:58.000 --> 06:04.551
I ended up having better access to sources in the church.

06:05.003 --> 06:11.093
And especially since you hadn't covered Moscow or the Vatican, maybe by reputation?

06:11.293 --> 06:18.725
Yeah, I think by, one, by being an American, by being... Who you are?

06:19.426 --> 06:21.470
Yeah.

06:22.471 --> 06:32.327
Marco certainly had more sources in the Soviet Union, though basically the reporting in the Soviet Union really was something that we did...

06:33.269 --> 06:58.838
together which which was in fact we used and associated and to get to get the Politburo documents that's that was the important thing you don't mind my jumping around no but how essential well those documents are historic they

06:59.071 --> 07:02.235
Very sure, but were they sent you into the study in your view?

07:02.656 --> 07:03.377
Oh, absolutely.

07:03.397 --> 07:06.781
I mean, again, they're stunning.

07:07.322 --> 07:10.647
And they say three things.

07:10.667 --> 07:20.640
One, they show that they show

07:21.869 --> 07:31.763
the preoccupation with the Soviet leadership about this pope and about Solidarity and the fact that their hands were tied in Poland within 10 weeks.

07:33.245 --> 07:51.049
And there's a Politburo minutes that we got for October 29, 1980, within 10 weeks of the signing of the Gdansk agreements, just two and a half months after the beginning of Solidarity.

07:51.333 --> 07:56.837
Grezhnev opens the meeting and says, the counter-revolution is in full force.

07:57.273 --> 07:59.455
runs through the whole country.

07:59.495 --> 08:03.099
People bow to the Pope on his knees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:04.200 --> 08:10.086
And then Gromyko says, we can't lose Poland.

08:10.427 --> 08:15.332
The Soviet Union lost 600,000 officers and soldiers to liberate Poland.

08:15.392 --> 08:17.254
We cannot lose Poland.

08:17.274 --> 08:19.616
What an extraordinary moment.

08:19.636 --> 08:25.002
And then in April, six months after

08:25.792 --> 08:27.855
Solidarity is formed.

08:27.875 --> 08:41.316
Ustinov, the defense minister, says, tells the Politburo, we can lose all the achievements of socialism because of what's happening in it.

08:42.297 --> 08:44.601
All the achievements of the revolution.

08:44.641 --> 08:52.693
Six months afterwards, the guys in the Kremlin, you know, until this book, we had no idea that within six months,

08:53.163 --> 09:07.196
The people in the Kremlin knew that they were on the ropes, that communism was being tested as it had never been tested before, and that they could lose the whole communist empire.

09:07.556 --> 09:08.957
They were talking about it.

09:08.977 --> 09:11.480
First time we know this.

09:12.741 --> 09:20.147
So those Politburo documents, and they have to make you wonder about the assassination as well.

09:20.668 --> 09:22.950
We're about the same age, and I have to say,

09:24.128 --> 09:29.474
Even at this age, you still get that wonderful feeling that you're on the track of a good story.

09:29.494 --> 09:30.335
Absolutely.

09:30.395 --> 09:36.762
Was there a point at which you said, hey man, this is good stuff.

09:36.802 --> 09:46.192
Well, the Palapura Minutes, but also I got the first time I've ever used the Freedom of Information Act to this effect.

09:46.332 --> 09:47.213
Well, it's not.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.136
It's the second time they gave me the basis of a book.

09:50.521 --> 09:51.983
I forgot about it.

09:52.243 --> 09:58.549
I used the Freedom of Information Act for my parents' FBI file in my book.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.153
And this time, I got the Walters documents.

10:02.313 --> 10:09.981
I got the actual cables that Walters sent back to the White House, the State Department, and the CIA from his visits with the Pope.

10:10.001 --> 10:10.842
And it was astonishing.

10:11.743 --> 10:18.030
The first time I got them back, they were excised, to the point where you really couldn't tell much.

10:18.170 --> 10:20.072
And then I filed an appeal.

10:20.609 --> 10:25.453
And I happened to know some people who intervened in the appeal process.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.155
So I got to them.

10:27.735 --> 10:29.737
And they're unbelievably revealing.

10:29.757 --> 10:43.029
I mean, they show, you know, they say, I told the Pope of the need for absolute secrecy about the overhead photography, meaning the satellite photos that Walter showed.

10:43.049 --> 10:48.574
You can just see the two of them hunched over the desk and talking about it.

10:48.875 --> 10:57.008
So what you get in this book is, you know, they talked about a hundred different things.

10:57.108 --> 10:58.651
This wasn't just about Poland.

10:58.731 --> 11:03.599
This wasn't just about the Soviet Union.

11:03.659 --> 11:04.781
It was Latin America.

11:04.881 --> 11:14.376
It was, you know, the church in the United States followed parallel courses and exchanged information and judgments on...

11:14.795 --> 11:28.736
Nicaragua, Salvador, Chile, Argentina, Philippines, as well as humanitarian things, famine in Africa.

11:29.817 --> 11:35.546
You weren't going to be able to do an interview with Pope.

11:35.646 --> 11:37.348
No, I didn't know that.

11:37.509 --> 11:39.872
I was really hopeful that he would see us.

11:40.473 --> 11:44.599
I thought there was a real chance that he would.

11:45.625 --> 11:50.071
You know, he's documented a difference to journalists apparently.

11:51.152 --> 11:59.783
Well, it's true, but I thought the fact is that I was able to get to the people closest to him, Cardinal Descour, nobody had ever talked to before.

12:00.984 --> 12:07.212
And I went to see Cardinal Descour half a dozen times on his book.

12:07.192 --> 12:18.400
You were talking earlier about being able to make contact, and why was I able to do it a little more than my partner on this?

12:18.903 --> 12:26.598
They also have a view in the Vatican of the Vatican journalist that's rather contemptuous.

12:28.181 --> 12:32.369
Well, they call him Vaticanisti.

12:32.389 --> 12:36.697
And Marco, of course, is much better than that.

12:36.737 --> 12:40.725
He's the best of the Vatican journalists, and he's a brilliant interpreter.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.851
of what's going on in the Vatican.

12:43.871 --> 12:48.376
And European reporting is a little different than American reporting.

12:48.416 --> 12:54.803
It's not nearly so much... More impassioned, perhaps?

12:54.823 --> 13:00.449
No, it's more interpretive and less initial getting of information.

13:00.589 --> 13:07.557
It's more interpreting events than getting original information.

13:08.212 --> 13:10.215
So I was able... Not as much legwork, in other words.

13:10.455 --> 13:11.837
Not as much legwork, yeah.

13:12.939 --> 13:22.492
So I... Delmarco was able to get to some people in the Pope's childhood that were very important.

13:22.512 --> 13:23.593
Yeah, that was fascinating.

13:23.613 --> 13:25.957
And you did very good work on that.

13:26.457 --> 13:27.519
Thank you.

13:28.019 --> 13:31.985
You don't mind if I eat and talk?

13:32.005 --> 13:32.305
Please, please.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.028
We're working.

13:34.508 --> 13:37.473
It's a nice look at this, isn't it?

13:37.713 --> 13:37.813
Yeah.

13:38.317 --> 13:49.777
So, Marco had European languages, which I lacked.

13:49.798 --> 13:57.912
He speaks fluent German, fluent French, Russian, Italian.

13:58.432 --> 14:07.363
had been married to someone Polish, so that helped in Poland a little too.

14:07.383 --> 14:13.952
Do you think that there was anxiety on their part that this might be hostile?

14:15.414 --> 14:15.995
Absolutely.

14:16.015 --> 14:25.367
I think they still think it's hostile to an extent, because I saw the AP story, there's no comments from the Vatican, which is interesting.

14:25.387 --> 14:26.548
There couldn't be more

14:26.849 --> 14:52.300
mistaken, of course, but they believe that talking about an alliance, an informal alliance, you know, there was no signed agreement between the Reagan administration, they all like to acknowledge that there was an alliance, because it portrays the Pope as a temporal figure,

14:53.680 --> 15:03.531
rather than as a solely spiritual figure, I think they're very short-sighted about this.

15:03.551 --> 15:12.240
I think particularly because the Pope, I know the heart of the Pope's message is to live in the truth.

15:13.762 --> 15:23.653
And to have difficulty acknowledging publicly

15:24.308 --> 15:39.491
The truth of what his role was and how it interacted with other temporal forces is a little sad.

15:40.052 --> 15:45.320
How about, I mean, the question cracks me up.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.644
Did you bring any baggage to this kind of a project?

15:47.764 --> 15:49.607
What do you mean?

15:50.296 --> 15:56.224
preconceptions about the Pope, I mean, a viable figure as an individual.

15:56.244 --> 16:04.856
How is it all basically I'm going to learn and then I'll report as I go along?

16:04.876 --> 16:07.980
You must at some point have to start making judgments.

16:08.341 --> 16:17.974
I think the only preconceptions I have is that I have very few preconceptions because I knew so little about

16:18.173 --> 16:24.643
about the church and the papacy as institutions.

16:25.143 --> 16:36.740
And what little I knew about the character of the man, I had read, and I never very much trust these things until I get involved.

16:36.760 --> 16:43.410
How do you emerge from this, judging his intellect, his mind?

16:43.430 --> 16:44.432
He's brilliant.

16:44.452 --> 16:44.732
Really?

16:45.313 --> 16:45.413
Yeah.

16:45.798 --> 17:08.717
brilliant he he has a system philosophically he's look he's he's a poet he's a philosopher he's a theologian he's uh he is a political leader he's a spiritual leader he's

17:11.026 --> 17:32.477
he's an actor has been an actor he's mesmerized the greatest crowds in the history of the earth you can't do that without incredible intellect well you've got an 800 million audience well but it's not well well other popes have had 800 million that's not that's what he's gone beyond right he's he goes out and sees them

17:32.980 --> 17:37.287
And he preaches before a million and a half people in a meadow.

17:37.327 --> 17:43.136
This has never happened before.

17:43.316 --> 18:00.743
You know, the real question about greatness is... What makes great leaders is...

18:01.837 --> 18:07.166
What do they do with the opportunities they're dealt?

18:10.751 --> 18:21.148
And both the Pope and Reagan did incredible things with the opportunities they were dealt.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.233
One of the interesting things to me, you talk about preconceived notions,

18:25.512 --> 18:26.153
I'm a liberal.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.841
I'm one of the few people in America that still calls himself a liberal.

18:30.861 --> 18:42.861
But I mean, my basic values are those of liberalism, both in the philosophical sense and in the sense of the American political vocabulary.

18:43.803 --> 18:50.895
I had a view of Reagan's administration until I started on this story for Time magazine.

18:51.145 --> 18:56.153
as a really negative view.

18:58.076 --> 19:03.544
I still don't like what he did in terms of the domestic politics of this country.

19:04.185 --> 19:08.972
I think his domestic policies were disastrous.

19:10.014 --> 19:14.280
And I think he had a very weak grasp of the real conditions of America.

19:14.841 --> 19:18.807
However, his intuition and actions

19:19.478 --> 19:49.013
about the soviet union and soviet empire and poland and the pope were brilliant amazing and and we and we have we have to give him credit particularly those of us in the media and who might be predisposed the other way that you know i went to see him in 91 when i did the time magazine story and i said

19:49.516 --> 19:51.819
How did you?

19:52.059 --> 19:56.025
The first thing he said to me about the Vatican, he said, I wanted to make them an ally.

19:56.045 --> 19:58.989
It's in the book.

19:59.049 --> 19:59.269
Nope.

19:59.830 --> 20:04.716
The other thing he did with the Pope, he said, Yalta can't stand.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.480
Yalta cannot stand.

20:08.502 --> 20:10.945
That it's morally wrong.

20:10.965 --> 20:14.089
I mean, the two of them, as I wrote,

20:14.390 --> 20:30.593
considered a proposition so radical that no leaders in the West had ever embraced it, that the Soviet Union would collapse more for moral reasons than for strategic ones.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.474
I think it's a combination.

20:32.534 --> 20:33.114
No, no.

20:33.134 --> 20:39.381
I think one reason that it couldn't be sustained economically is it couldn't be sustained morally.

20:43.044 --> 20:52.254
That if the economics don't work, partly because nobody wants to work, because the moral basis of it is absent.

20:52.394 --> 20:58.200
As the Pope says, the man, creative man, individual man,

20:58.619 --> 21:01.523
is not recognized.

21:01.563 --> 21:06.589
Do you see this book as a biography in a classical sense?

21:06.609 --> 21:09.092
It's certainly a hybrid.

21:09.172 --> 21:12.176
I never knew quite how to do it.

21:12.336 --> 21:14.158
I mean, except to do it.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.303
I knew that it could not be a conventional biography.

21:20.106 --> 21:26.854
It had to have a spine of it that was Poland and the confrontation

21:27.256 --> 21:31.482
with totalitarianism.

21:31.743 --> 21:46.244
And that includes the confrontation with Nazism, because he grew up under the Nazis, and I knew that that had to be the spine of the book, and yet it had to be a biography.

21:47.105 --> 21:54.917
So that this book had to be a combination of biography, history, journalism, and dramatic narrative.

21:55.420 --> 21:56.942
Very unusual.

21:57.362 --> 22:19.410
So that meant that though it had to cover a 76-year life, I did not want to give an equal number of pages to every 10-year period.

22:20.191 --> 22:23.335
So that...

22:24.023 --> 22:28.692
The way to do this, I thought, was almost cinematic.

22:28.712 --> 22:45.525
To pick seeds and periods that were really important thematically and maybe devote 30, 40, 50 pages to a one-year period of his life.

22:45.623 --> 22:48.686
and then three pages to the next ten years.

22:49.407 --> 23:07.346
So, therefore, we took sex and young people and did that thematically because young people figure so much in his schema and the role.

23:07.627 --> 23:12.492
There are really four, I guess, themes in this book.

23:13.349 --> 23:20.918
are four elements of his life, his mysticism.

23:21.919 --> 23:23.120
He's a mystic.

23:23.140 --> 23:28.526
Now, as the other surprise, I didn't know he was a mystic when I began on this.

23:28.566 --> 23:36.876
When the first person told me that he prayed stretched out on the floor like Christ on the cross, I about fell over.

23:38.442 --> 23:45.334
Turns out it's not quite as rare as I thought originally.

23:47.237 --> 23:51.704
But still, again, nobody knew this.

23:51.724 --> 24:00.840
People don't know that this Pope lays down on a cold marble floor with his arms stretched out every day.

24:01.761 --> 24:04.045
And that he draws inspiration this way.

24:05.105 --> 24:05.726
Think about it.

24:05.966 --> 24:09.530
I mean, that's kind of an amazing thing.

24:10.211 --> 24:10.952
So he's a mystic.

24:12.233 --> 24:17.720
So there's that aspect of his character in life.

24:18.400 --> 24:31.515
There's his confrontation with communism and the alliance with Reagan, which obviously is the heart of the book, both dramatically and in terms of his impact on our era.

24:31.535 --> 24:33.778
It's the longest section of the book.

24:35.058 --> 24:48.320
It's a 150-page section and then another 50-page section, and it also even opens with that in the prologue, and to some extent it ends with that as well.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.004
So there's that.

24:52.446 --> 24:55.952
Then there is his relationship to women.

24:56.725 --> 25:14.818
Which is, he is both at ease with women in a way that no Pope probably has been on a personal level, and yet he has a tormented relationship to womankind.

25:15.895 --> 25:26.729
that of course has been the most difficult aspect of his papacy in terms of, can I have some decaf?

25:27.069 --> 25:30.233
You know what, I have a double decaf espresso.

25:30.854 --> 25:37.482
Has been the subject of more dissent in the church.

25:37.951 --> 25:42.722
and from non-Catholics than any other area of his papacy.

25:42.862 --> 25:50.138
And talk about surprises, this relationship with Madame Timoniska.

25:51.940 --> 25:54.346
I mean, I was blown away by it.

25:54.406 --> 25:59.378
Yeah, well, you really tried to find out about her, if there was any kind of... I mean, you really pressed her on that.

25:59.498 --> 26:04.590
Well, first of all, I went... Oh, was that the talk I heard, that maybe there was something?

26:04.651 --> 26:06.134
Nobody ever heard of this woman.

26:06.154 --> 26:09.021
What happened was I saw that she was...

26:09.001 --> 26:24.360
Well, because it became, because one, I had gone to, by the time I saw her, I had been to see Professor Williams, and I knew that there was some kind of attraction between the two.

26:25.049 --> 26:34.048
But what happened was I was looking for people who had spent time with the Pope so that I could get a more intimate picture of them.

26:34.069 --> 26:40.763
And of course, here was this woman who, as far as I could see, had never figured in any papal biographies.

26:41.519 --> 26:45.944
And yet, she had been his editor and his collaborator.

26:46.885 --> 26:58.839
So I went to see her, and the next thing I noticed, she started telling me about their 90 pieces of correspondence socked away, and the Pope betrayed her, and all this other stuff.

27:01.642 --> 27:07.789
I was amused to read that she's actually, for a while, she's been suing them for copyrighting.

27:07.809 --> 27:08.910
But...

27:09.228 --> 27:28.217
And she said to me, I talked to her a couple weeks ago, before the book came out, because I wanted her to know what I had said, so that she didn't get deluged and surprised by a pack of reporters on her lawn or something.

27:29.318 --> 27:37.851
And the only thing that she took any exception to was that Professor Williams had described her as...

27:38.388 --> 27:57.072
infatuated and she said no no no no well what she said was infatuation implies being swept off your feet in a one-way relationship she said she said to me this was a mutually affectionate relationship

27:58.064 --> 28:00.506
Not physical, but mutually affectionate.

28:01.087 --> 28:02.328
And I think that's right.

28:02.608 --> 28:04.430
I think it was, and he is.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.232
You know, it continues this religion.

28:07.392 --> 28:12.236
Are you mindful of certain taboos?

28:12.877 --> 28:13.638
Of course.

28:13.678 --> 28:14.959
Of course.

28:14.979 --> 28:19.162
It's very important not to misrepresent what that wrote to a surname.

28:19.182 --> 28:21.284
It's very... Pardon me?

28:21.304 --> 28:23.626
And it doesn't help you having a Jewish surname.

28:24.327 --> 28:25.648
No, that doesn't.

28:25.968 --> 28:27.970
That doesn't matter.

28:28.355 --> 28:33.500
I'm not worried about that.

28:33.681 --> 28:37.404
You've got to be careful.

28:37.425 --> 28:43.151
No, I... Look, you have to be careful as a person, as a journalist.

28:43.251 --> 28:51.099
You have to be respectful of any... I mean, we were respectful of Nixon.

28:51.119 --> 28:53.181
We were respectful of the presidency.

28:53.161 --> 28:59.712
I mean, I don't think you go after... You're looking for information.

28:59.752 --> 29:01.135
You're looking for context.

29:01.195 --> 29:02.998
You're looking for understanding.

29:03.839 --> 29:16.621
You're not looking for... Look, I come away from this project thinking this is one of the great men of the century.

29:16.721 --> 29:18.865
Having said that, let me just jump ahead.

29:19.722 --> 29:25.937
He did point out he's getting older and infirm and maybe times are passing him by.

29:26.017 --> 29:29.466
And maybe the interests of the people in the church.

29:29.546 --> 29:34.518
Maybe he has watched his whole trip should be going.

29:34.538 --> 29:37.225
You talk about women, you talk about...

29:37.205 --> 29:39.467
The church is moving along.

29:39.548 --> 29:40.389
Absolutely.

29:40.409 --> 29:46.695
The church now has less binding relevance on the church.

29:46.876 --> 29:48.958
No, I'm not finished yet.

29:49.118 --> 29:52.181
Than he did 15 years ago.

29:52.262 --> 29:52.962
Absolutely.

29:53.022 --> 29:55.145
His power is diminishing within the church.

29:56.046 --> 29:58.248
No question about it.

30:00.871 --> 30:03.854
Things are starting to slip away.

30:04.615 --> 30:07.178
From him?

30:07.377 --> 30:09.282
From his power.

30:09.302 --> 30:11.288
From his power.

30:11.588 --> 30:14.015
His power of the position.

30:14.296 --> 30:14.817
His power.

30:15.038 --> 30:17.404
You don't know what's going to happen with the position.

30:18.093 --> 30:21.559
But you suggest that he's the last of them.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.043
I suspect that's the case.

30:24.624 --> 30:27.027
You don't know for sure.

30:27.067 --> 30:35.040
And, you know, when you discuss quite brilliantly, I think, I mean, you really did get some good sources on the election process.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.282
Absolutely.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.346
I thought that was terrific stuff.

30:38.386 --> 30:40.850
That is Marco, incidentally.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.312
Yeah, that's true.

30:42.697 --> 30:58.832
Marco did, with the exception of the scene of him crying, which I came up with, Marco did the election.

30:58.852 --> 31:00.175
Yeah, it was good.

31:00.355 --> 31:01.077
It was really...

31:01.563 --> 31:05.872
And I've not seen anything like that before.

31:05.932 --> 31:09.019
Another thing I have to say jumping around here is what I like.

31:09.139 --> 31:16.635
And this is in no way meant as a rapid, you know, procedure, but you do name your sources here.

31:16.836 --> 31:17.998
Well, absolutely.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.225
I think we've kind of gotten away from our...

31:22.066 --> 31:23.948
It depends.

31:25.310 --> 31:32.379
It depends, but it's easy.

31:34.181 --> 31:37.945
I like to see the names across.

31:38.065 --> 31:44.073
Well, if it serves a... It's a very difficult thing.

31:45.074 --> 31:48.478
I felt strongly that

31:48.948 --> 32:01.313
that if possible, I wanted this book to be, partly because the revelations are so stunning, I wanted people to know where the information came from.

32:02.174 --> 32:06.062
And with very few exceptions, I was able to

32:06.987 --> 32:23.477
name the sources and there are only about three anonymous sources in the whole thing you have footnotes which i like yes now now but i i would hate that to be implied as a criticism of uh of either bob

32:23.828 --> 32:25.410
Or my earlier work.

32:25.630 --> 32:27.453
No, I wouldn't do it with your earlier work.

32:27.733 --> 32:32.039
Because there's no way we could have done that work without using anonymous sources.

32:32.079 --> 32:36.005
We could not have written any of those books without anonymous sources.

32:36.025 --> 32:39.249
But I think 20 years later, it's become too easy.

32:39.370 --> 32:42.794
And speaking of your former colleague Rob, I think he uses it.

32:42.814 --> 32:44.757
He hasn't been making a comment yet.

32:45.563 --> 33:15.182
to access that's my take on it i don't think he does but um and i think also that it's very easy and obvious in bob's most recent books to see who he's talking to he doesn't take a brain scientist and he makes it easy for the reader i mean anybody can tell on the previous book not his last one that he talked to mrs clinton

33:15.685 --> 33:19.991
you know, can't reach the briefcase.

33:20.591 --> 33:28.241
But anyway, I think that one thing that you do get out of this is that this is more of a book for the record.

33:29.403 --> 33:30.664
Yes, obviously.

33:30.744 --> 33:39.936
No, if I had it, I wanted, I do think there is too much use of anonymous sources when it's not necessary.

33:39.996 --> 33:44.562
I think it's particularly common to be in daily journalism

33:44.913 --> 33:50.602
a convention used to elude the truth and to write lies.

33:51.624 --> 33:56.792
I mean, I think the gossip columns are full of it.

33:56.812 --> 34:04.023
The terrible thing that's happened in journalism is that the truth is no longer the basis of journalism, too often.

34:04.143 --> 34:09.672
And I've written extensively about it, as you probably know.

34:10.394 --> 34:25.112
I wrote a cover story from the New Republic called Idiot Culture about talk show values, tabloid values, and...

34:25.784 --> 34:29.288
19... I can get it for you if you need it.

34:29.408 --> 34:30.309
Call the New Republic.

34:30.329 --> 34:31.410
They'll get it for you.

34:31.751 --> 34:37.117
19... Not necessarily for this piece, but I'm working on a new book.

34:37.537 --> 34:39.760
You should get it.

34:39.860 --> 34:45.006
It's the first piece written about this subject, and it started a real debate.

34:45.026 --> 34:50.492
Within the last five years, he said.

34:50.776 --> 34:56.586
It's about... I've got it upstairs, actually.

34:56.606 --> 34:59.291
I need the copy I have with me.

34:59.712 --> 35:00.534
It's a cover story.

35:00.554 --> 35:06.564
It's called Idiot Culture, and it's 1992.

35:07.706 --> 35:08.748
I really love it.

35:08.828 --> 35:13.577
1992.

35:13.793 --> 35:24.684
I think we talked about the Pope's relevance today.

35:24.704 --> 35:27.767
So you think that his shot was made, basically.

35:27.847 --> 35:29.769
I mean, his moment arrived and he sees it.

35:29.789 --> 35:31.131
No, no, but yes.

35:31.211 --> 35:31.952
Well, absolutely.

35:31.972 --> 35:34.935
But he's also, it's not just the fall of communism.

35:34.955 --> 35:42.923
Though he has...

35:44.050 --> 36:03.966
being out of touch in some ways particularly with with what's happened with women i mean i think that you have to see the the failure the one great failure of his papacy is in the area of women i don't think there's any question any question about it

36:05.313 --> 36:10.220
And even people around him acknowledge that.

36:10.300 --> 36:15.807
Some people around him acknowledge it, not most of them, but some.

36:17.389 --> 36:32.029
Nonetheless, you also have to remember that though he rails against the age, our age, and against modernism, and against moral relativism,

36:32.414 --> 36:38.285
There is a great validity to his criticism of our time.

36:41.671 --> 36:43.294
It is an upbringing.

36:43.314 --> 36:52.330
He does speak from a humanism that is unique among the world's leaders with the possible exception of Mandela.

36:53.153 --> 37:12.917
He does talk about, in a way that no other leader, again Mandela might be the exception, about the disparity of people's incomes, about racism, discrimination, nationalism, tribalism.

37:14.112 --> 37:20.100
He understands it in a way, and what it's doing to our age in a way that no other leader does.

37:21.682 --> 37:23.385
It's remarkable.

37:24.326 --> 37:31.175
He has more to say to our time, even though he is out of touch in some ways.

37:31.276 --> 37:36.002
He has a basic grasp of the failures of our age.

37:35.982 --> 37:40.768
Yeah, he's remarkable.

37:41.429 --> 37:53.063
Going back to win his election in 1978, and I'd forgotten that it was absolutely at the same time as the skies falling around.

37:53.083 --> 37:57.729
I mean, you forget that these things happen almost at the same time.

37:57.749 --> 38:03.897
Of course, when you're big now, look, put yourself in the shoes, and you're so huge in here looking at this going on over there.

38:03.877 --> 38:25.412
Somebody who was strong on doctrine, who was a humanist,

38:27.232 --> 38:33.822
and who was not an Italian by the time of the last ballot.

38:35.024 --> 38:36.706
Or the last ballot is amazing.

38:37.367 --> 38:41.073
But there was not a strong Italian you point out.

38:41.233 --> 38:41.353
Right.

38:41.373 --> 38:50.206
And finally, someone who had some familiarity with the confrontation with communism.

38:50.607 --> 38:55.534
And who was able to engage communism on a spiritual level.

38:55.514 --> 39:05.986
And he had as much or more experience than anyone in this regard.

39:07.088 --> 39:14.356
It's important to remember that Poland is a unique entity in the Catholic world.

39:14.456 --> 39:19.142
It is the only country in the Catholic world

39:19.122 --> 39:36.456
at the time, it was 95% Catholic in a communist country.

39:37.094 --> 39:59.724
You think it'll be another 450 years before they have another night?

39:59.804 --> 40:02.207
I don't have a clue.

40:02.626 --> 40:03.848
Oh, you must have an idea.

40:03.928 --> 40:05.210
No, no.

40:05.231 --> 40:07.535
Do you think I would have any idea?

40:07.575 --> 40:15.909
Well, 400 years, the idea of me talking about the next 400 years would be absurd.

40:15.929 --> 40:17.752
Might the next one be Italian?

40:17.892 --> 40:19.656
Yes, it might well be.

40:20.437 --> 40:21.519
But again, nobody knows.

40:21.799 --> 40:23.402
And...

40:24.260 --> 40:38.582
I think that the Cardinals also are going to be looking for a rest.

40:38.682 --> 40:43.108
This guy has worn them out.

40:44.951 --> 40:52.883
There's been incredible tension in the church during this papacy, not just over doctrine, but the struggle with communism.

40:54.871 --> 40:58.215
in a strange way was enervating.

40:58.316 --> 41:10.692
It focused the activities of the Pope and part of the papacy on this war, this war for the souls.

41:10.852 --> 41:22.127
This was a new crusade, but it was conducted not on a strictly ideological level, but on a spiritual level.

41:22.664 --> 41:44.655
So, I think the Cardinals, to the extent that you can generalize, would like a little peace and quiet for a while, and would like to move toward

41:45.007 --> 41:55.356
the women in their church and do something about this schism, this fissure.

41:56.757 --> 41:58.779
Right.

41:58.879 --> 42:14.592
Yeah, this is good.

42:14.926 --> 42:27.670
So they rank folks the way they rank presidents, you know, I guess.

42:28.055 --> 42:34.002
Do they rank them?

42:34.022 --> 42:40.689
Do they evaluate them?

42:40.709 --> 42:41.169
Sure.

42:42.010 --> 42:49.739
But he is going to be, he's obviously one of the great folks.

42:50.680 --> 42:58.028
I guess with Leo XIII and John XXIII are the great ones of the last hundred years.

42:58.666 --> 43:02.110
Well, sure.

43:02.850 --> 43:06.614
I mean, this man's impact is huge.

43:07.055 --> 43:09.417
This is just speculation here.

43:09.437 --> 43:11.860
Do you think he was mindful?

43:12.180 --> 43:23.452
When you think of, you know, a folk having an influence on world defense, and you also call Reagan, Reagan amazing, by saying, World War II could have been prevented.

43:23.653 --> 43:27.897
And then we think of how the, of the, of the,

43:28.282 --> 43:35.012
Of course he was, because he grew up in Poland.

43:35.273 --> 43:47.992
Now I was going to say, the one other theme that we haven't discussed in the book is that of Jews and Judaism.

43:48.914 --> 43:50.777
That's the other great theme of his life.

43:50.797 --> 43:55.504
He's the first folk since Peter to grow up in a Jewish milieu.

43:55.484 --> 43:59.048
He grew up in a town with a 20% Jewish population.

43:59.609 --> 44:02.933
His schoolmates were Jewish.

44:03.814 --> 44:08.159
A good portion of his class at his high school died at Auschwitz.

44:10.622 --> 44:14.326
He was Archbishop of the diocese that included Auschwitz.

44:16.028 --> 44:19.392
And he had a Jewish landlord.

44:20.714 --> 44:25.339
He's the first pope to set foot in a synagogue since Peter.

44:28.407 --> 44:47.055
He went to synagogue, as we recount, to hear the Kol Nibir sung on the high holidays with his father, to hear this renowned cantor.

44:47.155 --> 44:55.748
Of the two girls he was most attracted to as a youth, one was Jewish, Ginka Rosenfeld, Ginka Beer,

44:56.960 --> 45:06.470
To this day, the friends from his youth that he is from his high school that he's closest to is Jewish.

45:06.530 --> 45:22.005
I'm drawing a blank, but you know what I mean.

45:22.643 --> 45:31.312
So, and he recognized the state of Israel over the objections of his own curia.

45:32.113 --> 45:50.153
And perhaps his last great act, which is to plan for the Jubilee year, or the Millennial year, is to dedicate the year to Catholic reflection on anti-Semitism and the Inquisition.

45:50.538 --> 45:52.684
I mean, this is extraordinary.

45:53.305 --> 46:00.825
This church can never again embrace anti-Semitism as a result of this concept.

46:01.627 --> 46:06.480
Do you come away from this with any unanswered questions to you?

46:06.641 --> 46:06.741
Sure.

46:06.957 --> 46:14.269
I got a lot of questions I'd love to see answered.

46:14.369 --> 46:17.234
I'd love to talk to him about women.

46:17.254 --> 46:19.338
I'd like to hear him explain to me.

46:19.418 --> 46:28.493
I mean, that scene in the book with Sadiq is just chilling.

46:29.620 --> 46:33.127
the UN.

46:33.287 --> 46:41.563
I'd like to know what he feels about other individual leaders of our time.

46:41.584 --> 46:44.389
I'd like to

46:44.909 --> 46:47.153
These are the questions you'd have asked him, I gather.

46:47.173 --> 46:49.757
Yeah, well, except I know I wouldn't get an answer.

46:49.817 --> 46:54.965
I mean, you know, what do you think of the Queen of England?

46:55.045 --> 47:04.320
I don't think he's going to say, well... Right.

47:04.340 --> 47:06.824
Well, I'd like to talk to him about his mother.

47:06.864 --> 47:09.769
I'd like to talk to him about the circumstances of his...

47:09.749 --> 47:21.144
exactly what does he know about the circumstances of his mother's death, about how pregnancy weakened.

47:21.725 --> 47:34.142
Clearly there is a relationship, one of the other things in this book, between the circumstances of his birth and his views that have to do with abortion.

47:34.162 --> 47:38.187
His mother's life probably could have been saved had she had an abortion.

47:38.167 --> 47:42.315
Or had she not become pregnant with him?

47:43.618 --> 47:44.159
Amazing.

47:44.179 --> 47:45.201
Interesting.

47:45.321 --> 47:47.345
I've got about two minutes.

47:47.365 --> 47:52.315
I'm sorry, because I've got to be able to tell this.

47:52.335 --> 47:59.770
So for two minutes, a minute and a half, if they had given you an hour, one hour, just like I would ever do.

48:00.070 --> 48:26.652
i would have said tell me about your mother that would have been your first question just like that tell me about your mother what do you remember i would have asked him to reflect on his views about women and his mother um i would i would i would have liked i would have asked him more

48:26.986 --> 48:40.187
I would like to hear in his own words his feelings about Gorbachev.

48:40.427 --> 48:43.392
Yes, and a check please.

48:44.131 --> 48:48.358
So they wouldn't have been factual questions?

48:48.378 --> 48:49.380
No.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.303
Because that you can get anywhere.

48:51.464 --> 48:53.427
Yeah, of course.

48:54.389 --> 48:59.237
No, they have to do with philosophical...

48:59.842 --> 49:06.068
Oh, yes, absolutely.

49:06.088 --> 49:11.794
How do you want me to make it out?

49:11.994 --> 49:29.511
That's what I mean, Nick, right?
