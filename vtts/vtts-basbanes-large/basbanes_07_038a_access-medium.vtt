WEBVTT

00:03.862 --> 00:06.265
This is on Kaiser.

00:06.285 --> 00:10.069
We keep this because of the banquet thing in it.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.592
This is just a really beautiful taste.

00:12.612 --> 00:13.893
That's a lithograph, of course.

00:14.554 --> 00:18.298
That's one of the nicest lithographs I've ever seen.

00:18.318 --> 00:23.604
Look, this white Japanese silk with gold.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.726
Kaiser Wilhelm.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.830
No, Kaiser Franz Joseph.

00:28.850 --> 00:33.835
I just thought I saw... Oh, that's Marie...

00:34.372 --> 00:36.195
Yeah, that's been beautiful.

00:37.618 --> 00:39.241
When was his, what were his years?

00:41.445 --> 00:45.673
Oh, he arranged for 40 years, died in 1960.

00:45.693 --> 00:48.318
So he's a contemporary of the early crisis.

00:48.338 --> 00:48.418
Yes.

00:50.062 --> 00:51.584
But we have a lot of banquet things.

00:52.145 --> 00:55.131
And you see, what's nice about this is they have the overview.

00:56.782 --> 00:58.524
I've never seen that.

00:58.564 --> 01:02.249
Exactly who they are, so you know, and what the procession was.

01:02.269 --> 01:07.016
And we have the main banquets and some banquets with peasants.

01:07.636 --> 01:09.739
What would you call this kind of a book?

01:09.759 --> 01:18.010
That's a beautiful English name.

01:18.110 --> 01:20.353
Tribute book?

01:20.373 --> 01:21.275
No, not tribute book.

01:21.295 --> 01:26.181
It is, usually you say here for professors to do it.

01:26.735 --> 01:27.856
Monograph?

01:27.976 --> 01:28.177
No.

01:28.197 --> 01:48.921
I want to show you my favorite, which we regard as manuals, but you being a bookish person will think that it's a book.

01:48.941 --> 01:54.868
This is one of the Muslim classics that we have in the collection.

01:55.253 --> 02:03.782
The American Testimonial Banquet to Henry M. Stanley at the Portland Rooms.

02:03.802 --> 02:05.965
This is Henry, this is Stanley, the explorer.

02:07.006 --> 02:08.908
There's a brand new biography of him, which just came in.

02:08.968 --> 02:15.675
And who was, who all was there, but there's nothing like this book anymore.

02:15.695 --> 02:18.178
Feel this.

02:19.420 --> 02:19.880
There he is.

02:20.901 --> 02:22.002
What is this book?

02:22.022 --> 02:22.543
I think it's amazing.

02:23.249 --> 02:28.915
This is the menu, but with all the people in the party who went on the trip.

02:31.597 --> 02:33.439
This is the trip to Africa.

02:33.519 --> 02:33.780
Yeah.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.022
To find Livingston.

02:36.042 --> 02:37.003
To find Livingston.

02:37.423 --> 02:38.805
And that's the menu.

02:39.165 --> 02:41.107
The toast, the program of the music.

02:41.127 --> 02:42.028
And where was this?

02:42.188 --> 02:43.750
I didn't read it in New York.

02:43.770 --> 02:44.270
In New York.

02:44.370 --> 02:46.252
And an autograph.

02:46.272 --> 02:47.173
And there's Stanley there.

02:48.515 --> 02:48.655
Mm-hmm.

02:48.675 --> 02:49.656
And there's the signature there.

02:51.518 --> 02:51.838
Here it is.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.242
That's nice.

02:54.642 --> 02:55.403
Where'd you get this?

02:58.547 --> 02:59.488
Connections.

02:59.628 --> 02:59.788
Huh?

03:00.329 --> 03:02.011
Connections, huh?

03:02.031 --> 03:05.194
Besides the menu, this is what makes it so unbelievable.

03:05.254 --> 03:05.875
Which is what?

03:05.935 --> 03:08.658
Say it from my tape.

03:08.839 --> 03:11.762
These are photographs of the individual... Yes, on the expedition.

03:11.782 --> 03:14.906
...on the expedition, on separate, very thick pages.

03:14.926 --> 03:15.727
Photo engravings.

03:15.747 --> 03:16.668
Photo engravings.

03:17.228 --> 03:21.353
From the participants of the expedition.

03:21.772 --> 03:34.006
and participants who then successfully came back and attended the dinner given in honor of Stanley's founding living.

03:34.066 --> 03:36.189
And in each one underneath.

03:36.209 --> 03:38.571
Stanley gives a background about that person.

03:38.591 --> 03:40.193
Oh, it's like a little tribute, actually.

03:40.914 --> 03:42.276
And this, when was the year of this?

03:45.760 --> 03:48.663
So we can get it nailed down.

03:48.783 --> 03:51.306
Okay, the American Testimonial Banquet.

03:51.860 --> 04:05.974
to Henry M. Stanley in recognition of his heroic achievements in the cause of humanity, science, and civilization, and a greeting to his chief officers, Portland, Rome's London, May 30th, 18th.

04:06.074 --> 04:07.296
It's a hundred years old.

04:08.777 --> 04:11.800
And, by the way, how do you judge the food, the menu?

04:11.820 --> 04:13.382
Does it look like a pretty good dinner?

04:13.402 --> 04:18.507
It, not to be pretty good, but a well-designed meal of fame.

04:18.587 --> 04:21.630
So, you know, it was... Talk a little bit to me about it, please.

04:23.517 --> 04:33.832
Now, you're getting this book, so, Robert's already described its uniqueness, but now I want you, as a noted chef, to tell me what you, would you have liked to have been present at this dinner?

04:37.698 --> 04:42.305
Of course, you know, this is the end of the Victorian era.

04:42.325 --> 04:51.499
This is in the bell epoch, when French food governs the world, reigns over the world.

04:51.952 --> 04:53.254
Del Epoch.

04:53.414 --> 04:54.375
Yes.

04:54.395 --> 05:04.348
And in London, they started with orders, with assorted orders.

05:04.368 --> 05:10.957
Then as soups, we have the imperial consomme and the puree of tomatoes.

05:12.299 --> 05:21.030
Then comes the fish courses, salmon with cucumbers, Hollandese sauce, and

05:26.933 --> 05:28.636
There are several entrees, I can see.

05:28.916 --> 05:30.939
Yes, this is just a fish course.

05:30.959 --> 05:41.255
The second fish course is the little white fish nature, or deviled, which means hot.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.036
Deviled, yeah.

05:42.056 --> 05:53.734
Then comes the entrees, small timbaths of goose liver with truffles, and chafroa,

05:56.988 --> 06:01.313
with little medallions.

06:02.454 --> 06:06.079
Then comes the next course.

06:06.099 --> 06:12.867
Capon braised with tarragon.

06:13.628 --> 06:16.371
Ham with Madeira sauce.

06:16.391 --> 06:17.492
I don't want to eat this much.

06:17.733 --> 06:18.754
No, they chose one.

06:19.234 --> 06:20.015
Oh, I see.

06:20.035 --> 06:21.677
Okay.

06:21.697 --> 06:26.623
Then young lamb

06:28.662 --> 06:42.243
with mint sauce, French salad, potatoes, green beans and fresh spinach.

06:43.645 --> 06:57.066
Then as roast was roast duckling with small peas and braised game birds.

06:58.970 --> 07:01.173
or fresh white asparagus.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.022
Is this all in French, by the way?

07:07.823 --> 07:08.864
All written in French.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.549
Well, Chris, we end with cigars, I can see.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.492
It ends with cigars.

07:15.734 --> 07:20.060
Does it give the vintages of the wines, or does it just say Sherry Chablis?

07:20.080 --> 07:20.240
No, no.

07:20.260 --> 07:28.352
This is an English menu, and it just says Sherry, Chablis, Claret, Chablis.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.688
Fort Juan and Biggers.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.132
Sounds like a pretty nice dinner.

07:33.332 --> 07:34.233
Yeah.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.197
Magnificent.

07:37.217 --> 07:38.339
It's wonderful.

07:38.359 --> 07:40.181
La Cuisine Creole.

07:40.281 --> 07:43.265
That's not a reference, but look at this.

07:43.285 --> 07:46.670
That's the original.

07:46.690 --> 07:57.765
1885, La Cuisine, C-R-E-O-L-E, a collection of culinary recipes by F-F-H-A-N-S-E-L-L and Brothers Limited, New Orleans.

07:58.893 --> 08:02.337
This must be one of the very first Creole cookbooks.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.598
This is the first.

08:03.618 --> 08:05.059
Oh, this is the first.

08:06.401 --> 08:08.102
Now, how come this is here and out in Iowa?

08:09.564 --> 08:10.084
A mistake?

08:10.525 --> 08:10.805
No.

08:12.106 --> 08:13.388
No, I have two.

08:14.269 --> 08:15.630
Oh, a duplicate.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.113
You know, no university or no school.

08:18.133 --> 08:21.216
No, these are five, but they want two books.

08:22.317 --> 08:24.900
That's admirable.

08:24.920 --> 08:25.780
That's being piggish.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.223
I mean, except the Folger Shakespeare Library.

08:28.243 --> 08:28.343
Yeah.

08:28.610 --> 08:30.373
Which one's every captain.

08:30.393 --> 08:31.294
And this is our friend.

08:31.655 --> 08:33.978
This is... Favorite dishes.

08:34.318 --> 08:35.961
The Chicago Columbian Exhibition.

08:36.602 --> 08:39.747
Favorite dishes of the women managers of the fair.

08:40.508 --> 08:46.376
Remember Mrs. Palmer's husband is very well connected and she convinced them to let the women run the fair.

08:47.198 --> 08:53.687
And this was written by women, designed by women, and printed by a woman.

08:53.707 --> 08:56.271
That's very... This is 1893.

08:57.162 --> 09:02.487
The title is Favorite Dishes, a Colombian Autograph Souvenir Cookery Book.

09:02.507 --> 09:11.576
Over 300 autograph recipes and 23 portraits contributed specially by the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Colombian Exposition.

09:12.297 --> 09:12.778
Okay.

09:12.798 --> 09:13.538
This is Chicago.

09:17.302 --> 09:18.523
But these are doops.

09:18.663 --> 09:25.330
This was a different time that Roman exposed himself like this, not in the center for the playboy.

09:26.896 --> 09:40.698
And I want to get some spellings here.

09:40.718 --> 09:43.422
With the napkins in the back for the wedding?

09:44.704 --> 09:47.208
We owned the original of this book.

09:47.428 --> 09:50.252
And your original was in Iowa?

09:50.453 --> 09:50.653
Yes.

09:53.337 --> 09:55.080
I just want to see how you spell the trancher.

09:56.090 --> 10:03.879
Andres... Okay.

10:03.939 --> 10:08.444
G-R-E-N-C-H-I-E-R.

10:08.464 --> 10:11.548
And this would have been 1670.

10:11.768 --> 10:12.068
Okay.

10:15.312 --> 10:17.875
You told me about these earlier, so I had all this.

10:17.895 --> 10:19.897
The nap thing in the back with the wedding.

10:21.659 --> 10:24.122
You see, for the...

10:24.980 --> 10:32.988
These are all napkins folded by people who've been trained with napkin folding.

10:33.589 --> 10:39.915
And here, they folded whole tablecloths beside napkins also.

10:39.935 --> 10:42.378
This is what you took three years to pay for, right?

10:42.458 --> 10:43.099
An original?

10:43.299 --> 10:43.939
No, no, no.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.962
That's what's petite.

10:46.882 --> 10:54.210
And, you know, the hard—you see, here is a whole table with one folded tablecloth.

10:56.924 --> 11:02.451
And here, for weddings, a hand is mated by the roses.

11:02.491 --> 11:04.173
Hand-witching and mated?

11:04.714 --> 11:04.954
Yes.

11:06.636 --> 11:07.757
Very unusual, isn't it?

11:07.777 --> 11:08.178
For weddings.

11:08.699 --> 11:10.941
Of course.

11:10.961 --> 11:11.522
Makes sense.

11:11.682 --> 11:13.725
Yes.

11:13.745 --> 11:16.108
And cousins and peacocks and turkeys.

11:18.471 --> 11:19.212
This is lust.

11:19.472 --> 11:22.015
I mean, this type of thing is not done by anyone.

11:23.277 --> 11:25.159
These are fruit carvings.

11:26.489 --> 11:52.734
I'm going to let you go home pretty soon.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.277
It's 9 o'clock.

11:56.662 --> 11:58.845
I'm showing you a few things.

11:58.865 --> 11:59.105
Okay.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.951
I'm fine, but I don't want to overstay my welcome.

12:04.573 --> 12:07.116
We are the type of people we have called you.

12:07.136 --> 12:11.002
We hope you understand.

12:11.242 --> 12:14.747
I will call you a couple weeks before I'm coming, a week before.

12:14.807 --> 12:16.589
When are you coming to Chicago?

12:16.750 --> 12:17.851
October the 4th.

12:19.553 --> 12:21.616
That Friday, I've got pretty much open.

12:21.716 --> 12:24.040
Yeah, I will be not home then.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.842
I will be on a wedding.

12:26.665 --> 12:27.906
In Arizona.

12:27.926 --> 12:28.247
That week?

12:28.267 --> 12:29.908
And I'm coming home, yeah.

12:29.928 --> 12:30.248
Okay.

12:30.268 --> 12:34.773
And then I will be home to Arizona.

12:34.793 --> 12:34.893
Okay.

12:35.153 --> 12:37.255
You won't be there at all that week, you say?

12:37.375 --> 12:43.101
Uh, I think I'm coming home from Arizona on the 7th.

12:43.161 --> 12:46.124
Okay, I'll just check my calendar.

12:46.144 --> 12:47.525
Yeah.

12:47.545 --> 12:50.528
This is the first Chicago cookbook.

12:50.548 --> 12:53.091
The first Chicago cookbook of Cake Baker.

12:54.312 --> 12:54.752
By Paul.

12:55.773 --> 12:56.554
By A-P-O-L.

13:00.044 --> 13:01.426
Again, this should be in Iowa.

13:01.446 --> 13:02.387
Is this a joke?

13:03.229 --> 13:04.190
No.

13:07.835 --> 13:10.900
That's fine, you know.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.963
What do you explain to me?

13:12.983 --> 13:21.175
There's no such a thing that this should be, or this should be not, because this was

13:27.787 --> 13:32.354
This is a tiny little book, I would say six inches by perhaps three or four inches.

13:35.298 --> 13:39.444
You see, these books are not in my collection, never been in my collection.

13:40.245 --> 13:48.818
These are in my special Chicago imprint collection, what was never a part of my cookbook collection.

13:48.838 --> 13:50.440
The Chicago imprint collection.

13:50.701 --> 13:56.950
I collected in a special collection, in a special room,

13:57.908 --> 14:02.953
approximately 6,000 Chicago cookbooks.

14:03.013 --> 14:10.481
Among the things like this, no other copy ever known, no place any record.

14:10.741 --> 14:13.324
This is a unique copy, so far as we know.

14:13.624 --> 14:23.334
It's an absolute magnificent, with four-color cover, pre-Chicago fire book from the time of the Civil War.

14:23.354 --> 14:24.615
Well, let me just say what it is.

14:24.695 --> 14:26.036
It's the Household Treasure.

14:26.837 --> 14:27.578
That's the title.

14:28.267 --> 14:38.442
containing several hundred valuable receipts, R-E-C-E-I-P-T-S, for cooking, making dyes, coloring, cleaning, and cementing.

14:39.123 --> 14:43.709
Also, the latest and most approved means for the cure of diseases of men, women, and children.

14:44.670 --> 14:51.701
R.Landon, L-A-N-D-O-N, agent, Chicago, Illinois, price 25 cents.

14:51.721 --> 14:52.722
Do we have a date for that?

14:53.613 --> 14:54.975
We say pre-fire.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.298
No, but we know from the book.

14:57.318 --> 14:57.759
1865.

14:57.819 --> 15:01.925
So content.

15:02.085 --> 15:06.732
And that is, so far as you know, a unique copy.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.194
Definitely, absolutely.

15:08.214 --> 15:11.179
Never anybody heard of it.

15:11.199 --> 15:14.744
No collection lists it.

15:14.804 --> 15:16.907
That's what collecting is all about, isn't it?

15:16.927 --> 15:20.953
When I started to talk to Iowa, the first meeting I said,

15:21.811 --> 15:25.054
I'm not giving you my Chicago cookbooks.

15:25.074 --> 15:25.915
Oh, so they know that.

15:26.075 --> 15:28.057
Of course.

15:28.077 --> 15:29.459
Lakeside Cookbook.

15:30.580 --> 15:31.581
There are two of them here.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.404
Donnelly, Lloyd, L-O-Y-D, and Company.

15:36.586 --> 15:39.489
And these are, again, these are cookbooks from Chicago.

15:39.669 --> 15:41.491
Are you familiar with the Lakeside Press?

15:41.651 --> 15:42.132
No, I'm not.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.214
In Chicago, the Donnelly family?

15:44.274 --> 15:45.836
D-O-N-N-E-L-L-E-Y.

15:46.797 --> 15:47.638
I love Donnelly.

15:48.538 --> 15:50.080
They're the advertising people, no?

15:50.144 --> 15:59.572
But they are the largest printing family, fourth generation of American printers.

16:00.693 --> 16:20.151
And in the beginning, when Mr. Dunney started in the pre-fire Chicago, whenever he ran out of money so he could not pay his workers on the weekend, he asked his wife to write a cookbook, which they sold at every newsstand to the city.

16:20.941 --> 16:23.805
And the cookbook sold like hotcakes.

16:23.825 --> 16:26.168
It always went from the red into the black.

16:26.228 --> 16:28.211
She was a fabulous cook.

16:28.231 --> 16:30.094
He saved the company on numerous occasions.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.155
That's a great story.

16:31.355 --> 16:31.736
True.

16:31.756 --> 16:33.598
You can ask the diamond boy.

16:33.658 --> 16:36.663
You know, he's one of the great collectors in Chicago.

16:36.743 --> 16:37.083
Who is?

16:37.404 --> 16:38.705
Good friend of mine.

16:38.725 --> 16:39.727
What's his name?

16:39.747 --> 16:40.948
James Donnelly.

16:40.968 --> 16:41.750
Jim Donnelly.

16:41.950 --> 16:42.551
He's around?

16:43.051 --> 16:44.113
Oh, yeah.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.395
The boys are still running.

16:45.415 --> 16:46.736
Is he somebody I should talk to?

16:47.618 --> 16:48.679
I think so.

16:48.699 --> 16:50.121
Yeah, I don't know if you can.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.061
I will try, my darling.

16:52.081 --> 16:53.723
Well, I mean, he's a collector?

16:53.743 --> 16:55.024
Oh, yeah.

16:55.044 --> 16:55.204
Yeah.

16:55.224 --> 16:59.248
What kinds of things does he collect?

16:59.268 --> 17:00.789
Lakeside Press, you said, is the most famous?

17:01.730 --> 17:12.519
The most exciting and longest-running series of Americana are the Lakeside Books by Lakeside Press.

17:12.979 --> 17:15.842
Really, really collector's items.

17:15.862 --> 17:19.365
They are printed only for the friends of the family.

17:20.324 --> 17:21.326
Better for sale.

17:22.147 --> 17:24.911
I'm on the list since about 30 years.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.073
Every copy.

17:26.093 --> 17:26.874
Since 30 years.

17:26.894 --> 17:28.236
Every copy you have.

17:28.496 --> 17:30.559
Yeah, but these start with 30 years.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.666
So where do you find 6,000 different items just in Chicago imprints?

17:34.706 --> 17:36.228
Just in Chicago or everywhere?

17:36.428 --> 17:37.049
Everywhere.

17:37.069 --> 17:38.051
Two other words.

17:38.071 --> 17:39.633
You find these.

17:39.653 --> 17:39.934
You look.

17:39.954 --> 17:41.175
This is A-P-I-C-I-U-S.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.237
Apecius.

17:42.357 --> 17:43.098
Apecius.

17:43.158 --> 17:43.339
Apecius.

17:43.359 --> 17:43.519
Apecius.

17:43.539 --> 17:43.719
Apecius.

17:43.739 --> 17:44.280
Apecius.

17:44.380 --> 17:44.601
Apecius.

17:44.621 --> 17:44.781
Apecius.

17:44.801 --> 17:44.981
Apecius.

17:45.001 --> 17:45.221
Apecius.

17:45.241 --> 17:45.422
Apecius.

17:45.462 --> 17:45.622
Apecius.

17:45.642 --> 17:47.124
That's the famous Roman cookery book.

17:48.787 --> 17:49.588
That's the...

17:50.615 --> 18:20.250
second century book which was printed first in Latin I think in Basel in 1541 or so this is and this is the first English edition with the

18:21.361 --> 18:27.410
translation of the American chef in Chicago.

18:28.271 --> 18:35.161
And this is Mr. Williams, the author's working copy.

18:35.522 --> 18:42.232
James D., can I just see his name?

18:42.272 --> 18:42.813
Should I just spell it?

18:42.933 --> 18:45.797
Joseph D. V-E-H-L-I-N-G.

18:46.919 --> 18:49.022
Author's working copy.

18:49.897 --> 18:52.381
And this is about when, when it was?

18:52.402 --> 18:53.804
This was published.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.913
Two guys, 1956 or four.

18:58.933 --> 18:59.775
No, 1936.

18:59.795 --> 19:00.396
1936.

19:02.880 --> 19:14.201
Barbara, when did this page get written?

19:14.221 --> 19:14.301
Hmm.

19:19.478 --> 19:24.565
Now, is that something you'd want to fix, or would you read it like that?

19:24.585 --> 19:24.645
No.

19:24.665 --> 19:24.906
That's true.

19:24.926 --> 19:25.126
Mm-hmm.

19:25.146 --> 19:27.409
Yeah, it's old.

19:27.429 --> 19:29.292
Yeah.

19:29.312 --> 19:30.213
But you would fix that.

19:30.594 --> 19:31.034
Oh, yeah.

19:31.054 --> 19:31.876
A little price thing.

19:31.896 --> 19:42.010
Now, a plain street copy I just bought at the book sale of the Newberry Library a couple weeks ago for $200.

19:42.090 --> 19:42.571
Newberry?

19:42.711 --> 19:43.192
Yeah.

19:44.253 --> 19:45.154
You're still collecting?

19:45.215 --> 19:46.777
You're still buying?

19:47.197 --> 19:47.978
Yeah.

19:47.998 --> 19:49.080
Certain things.

19:49.718 --> 19:52.282
For yourself or for the collections?

19:52.302 --> 19:52.682
For both.

19:52.722 --> 19:57.269
For the Women's Art Industrial Association of Nevada.

19:57.349 --> 19:59.392
That's the first Nevada cookbook.

19:59.412 --> 20:03.578
Cookbook of the Women's Art and Industrial Association of Nevada.

20:03.598 --> 20:07.183
The first Nevada cookbook, 1887.

20:07.223 --> 20:08.585
So that's not even a state.

20:09.506 --> 20:11.710
I don't think Nevada was a state from 1887.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.535
I'll check it out.

20:15.555 --> 20:18.179
Castle City, Nevada.

20:18.199 --> 20:19.641
I bet it was a territory then, huh?

20:20.228 --> 20:21.850
I think so.

20:21.870 --> 20:22.791
That's great.

20:22.811 --> 20:23.352
That's nice.

20:23.452 --> 20:28.798
We do have a lot of, like, imprints and collected American regionals.

20:28.938 --> 20:34.804
There's a lot of the first South Carolina, very early.

20:34.844 --> 20:41.792
Yeah, the first New Mexico, the first five years old.

20:41.992 --> 20:47.839
I think I asked you earlier what got away that...

20:48.173 --> 20:51.997
I put it on after we finished that discussion.

20:52.517 --> 20:55.240
What got away, you know, that you really regret?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.942
Did you ever miss getting something that really upset you?

20:57.962 --> 20:59.744
Yeah, but I never... But you look ahead.

20:59.824 --> 21:00.965
The eyes are in front of your head.

21:01.025 --> 21:01.666
That's right.

21:01.766 --> 21:09.894
But, you know, sometimes I miss books because I called late or, you know, somebody was lucky.

21:11.015 --> 21:12.897
But I really never look at that.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.020
I always look at the next gap.

21:16.861 --> 21:17.762
How about dealers?

21:17.842 --> 21:19.944
Do they... You see, the thing is this.

21:20.925 --> 21:24.069
I need to buy books like a hole in my head.

21:24.089 --> 21:39.765
I'm not so well-heared financially that I could afford this, because my wife and I, we took care of our old time under normal circumstances.

21:42.048 --> 21:45.231
But we did not provide, really,

21:46.342 --> 21:51.409
for real fancy extras.

21:51.429 --> 22:06.010
But when I have an opportunity, when I see something that I know that I see once, it is like a beautiful sunny day.

22:06.030 --> 22:15.724
You look up on the sky, and the sky is blue, and there is one cloud, beautiful cloud, and it has a

22:17.729 --> 22:28.259
Just incredible shape of a young coat of a unicorn.

22:28.279 --> 22:31.722
And you just look at it as that, and it goes away.

22:33.524 --> 22:35.886
And it never ever comes again.

22:37.748 --> 22:37.928
You know?

22:37.948 --> 22:43.413
I was looking last week on a castle in Chicago.

22:44.914 --> 22:46.656
And it was already three days old.

22:49.083 --> 22:54.088
And I thought, well, too bad.

22:56.931 --> 23:14.888
Then I thought, no, it is good I didn't look public before, because probably I wouldn't be able to resist from the Heritage Collective Society, which is a village.

23:17.787 --> 23:24.556
And I said to my wife, I said, you know, I have here something.

23:25.638 --> 23:32.307
I am sorry, I couldn't buy it because I could not afford it.

23:32.347 --> 23:35.351
She said, what is it?

23:35.491 --> 23:39.817
I said, George Washington, 1732-1799, U.S.

23:39.977 --> 23:46.326
President, a two-column ship's paper issued to

23:47.099 --> 23:52.127
George Blair, master of the brig, Sammy.

23:52.147 --> 23:53.188
S-A-L-L-I-E.

23:53.789 --> 24:10.634
Of New York, of the burden of 100 tongues or thereabouts, lying a present in the port of New York, bound for new providence.

24:10.654 --> 24:16.583
And laden with flour, Indian meal, bread,

24:17.272 --> 24:29.668
Peas, beans, lard, beef, corn, potatoes, oats, rice, boards and shingles.

24:29.688 --> 24:40.822
Signed by George Washington as president, followed with Secretary of State Edmund Randolph and Mayor of New York Richard Warren.

24:43.084 --> 24:43.845
$8,500.

24:44.046 --> 24:46.789
So did you call?

24:48.642 --> 24:50.123
So my wife said, did you come?

24:50.143 --> 24:52.245
I said, no, I just don't have the money.

24:52.345 --> 24:53.386
I mean, just do that.

24:55.248 --> 24:57.370
The next morning I went to my office.

24:57.590 --> 24:58.791
My wife calls me up.

24:58.811 --> 25:10.362
She said, I just went to the bank this morning, and I put $10,000 in your account.

25:10.462 --> 25:12.043
Why don't you call up the bank?

25:12.063 --> 25:14.525
Come eat me on it.

25:14.545 --> 25:16.948
She knew you really wanted it.

25:16.968 --> 25:17.468
Well, you know,

25:17.903 --> 25:29.817
My whole collection is here in Providence, and here is a George Washington item, the kind of food item that is just fantastic for this collection.

25:31.039 --> 25:32.681
Coming to New Providence, no less.

25:32.841 --> 25:33.502
That's right.

25:34.643 --> 25:35.304
That's right.

25:36.706 --> 25:42.593
So I caught up, and the guy said, absolutely so.

25:43.354 --> 25:46.037
I said, oh, there are .

25:48.262 --> 25:51.085
And he said, who is this?

25:51.105 --> 25:52.487
Is this Dr. Satmari?

25:52.507 --> 25:53.548
I said, yes.

25:53.568 --> 26:02.399
He said, you know, I thought you, from your Brooklyn English and from, because this is a food pilot, but I thought you donated your collection.

26:02.419 --> 26:04.962
I said, yes, I did, but I still.

26:05.323 --> 26:09.167
He said, you know, this man doesn't collect food items.

26:10.028 --> 26:15.195
He wants this because he wants a nice Washington autograph.

26:15.255 --> 26:17.998
He doesn't give a damn book.

26:18.907 --> 26:20.088
Let me talk to him.

26:21.850 --> 26:25.594
Perhaps we can offer him something.

26:25.614 --> 26:28.076
And I explained him that this is for a school.

26:30.218 --> 26:35.443
So three days later he called, he said, I have the item.

26:36.584 --> 26:37.725
He's sending it back.

26:37.745 --> 26:38.546
Send your check.

26:39.187 --> 26:43.791
And we are selling him something for exactly the same price.

26:43.972 --> 26:45.253
We went down.

26:45.273 --> 26:45.893
No battery.

26:45.933 --> 26:48.576
The price is not a food.

26:48.910 --> 26:54.295
It's a military item, but he doesn't disagree because he just wants Washington.

26:54.315 --> 26:56.077
He just wants Washington.

26:56.097 --> 26:56.637
So you get it?

26:57.098 --> 26:58.479
So I get it.

26:58.579 --> 26:59.320
No, they get it.

26:59.360 --> 26:59.960
The school gets it.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.102
Well, yeah, but where does it go first, to Chicago?

27:02.122 --> 27:02.483
We're here.

27:02.643 --> 27:03.083
Not here.

27:03.544 --> 27:05.045
You don't even get to hold it first?

27:05.726 --> 27:07.968
No, I hope I will be here when it comes.

27:08.168 --> 27:13.193
I mean, you're going to give it, but at least I have to feel that you'd like to possess it.

27:13.693 --> 27:15.755
I already possess it.

27:15.775 --> 27:17.136
How have you already possessed it?

27:17.156 --> 27:18.057
You haven't seen it yet.

27:18.374 --> 27:19.676
You know what you've read.

27:19.696 --> 27:22.279
I know it is now.

27:22.299 --> 27:23.781
Isn't that wonderful?

27:23.821 --> 27:24.462
Be happy.

27:24.823 --> 27:31.572
I'm very happy because I know that this school can be twice 75-year-old.

27:31.592 --> 27:41.825
They will never fund a second George Washington item about food which has to do with Rhode Island.

27:43.568 --> 27:44.649
That's an idea.

27:44.749 --> 27:46.812
That's what the Latin school could call

27:47.551 --> 27:50.854
The Fate of the Books.

27:51.575 --> 27:52.736
How do you spell that?

27:53.357 --> 27:57.080
S-A-T-A, Fata, Libelli.

27:57.401 --> 28:00.664
L-I-B-E-L-L-I.

28:00.684 --> 28:01.825
That's one word, Libelli?

28:02.045 --> 28:02.325
Yes.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.048
That's the books.

28:05.228 --> 28:06.489
The Fate of the Books?

28:06.509 --> 28:11.234
See, that item belonged with you in the school.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.395
That's right.

28:12.415 --> 28:13.917
That's the fate of it.

28:14.137 --> 28:15.038
It's destiny.

28:15.678 --> 28:17.440
And you know what else was very important?

28:17.875 --> 28:18.456
Your wife?

28:18.736 --> 28:19.397
Yes.

28:19.617 --> 28:20.378
She was everything.

28:21.279 --> 28:26.084
Because you needed her blessing to get this book.

28:26.184 --> 28:29.909
I needed her understanding and cooperation.

28:30.009 --> 28:36.916
And to her great credit, she said, was she indulging you, do you think?

28:37.958 --> 28:39.119
I think, no.

28:39.219 --> 28:44.625
She felt that for this collection, it's so important to have decided.

28:45.314 --> 28:48.299
It's so important to see, to have this kind of support.

28:48.579 --> 28:49.781
Did you tell him about the handcuffs?

28:51.964 --> 28:52.605
Who did you buy that?

28:52.906 --> 28:55.910
Can I just see where you got that from, Heritage?

28:55.930 --> 29:01.398
This is somebody I don't know.

29:01.418 --> 29:03.141
Heritage Collector's Society.

29:07.828 --> 29:11.394
That's, uh, I've heard of them.

29:11.454 --> 29:14.258
11 West Court Street, Box 2300.

29:15.031 --> 29:20.456
Ballstown, PA, two and five, three, four, five, seven, nine, five.

29:20.976 --> 29:24.980
See, there's a guy in Chicago, Lumen, you ever heard of him?

29:25.100 --> 29:26.201
Yeah.

29:26.221 --> 29:29.844
I saw him by the Declaration of Independence for a million and a half dollars.

29:29.884 --> 29:31.926
Yeah.

29:32.246 --> 29:33.508
He was at that sale in New York.

29:34.148 --> 29:37.311
He came in New York, he had a red, white, and blue shirt on.

29:37.331 --> 29:39.833
Yeah.

29:39.853 --> 29:40.474
It was great.

29:41.935 --> 29:42.476
Did you buy this a book?

29:42.556 --> 29:42.816
No.

29:42.936 --> 29:42.996
No.

29:43.229 --> 29:45.452
He didn't buy it for Forbes, some other guy.

29:45.472 --> 29:48.337
It was an anonymous buyer, but somebody told me.

29:48.477 --> 29:49.999
Ralph Newman bought it.

29:50.019 --> 29:51.241
But he bought it for a collection.

29:51.421 --> 29:52.062
For somebody, yeah.

29:52.102 --> 29:56.389
And I know his name, but it wasn't Forbes.

29:56.409 --> 29:56.509
Yeah.

29:56.529 --> 29:59.253
So look, here, this is my job.

29:59.974 --> 30:01.636
May I, can I just say this?

30:02.338 --> 30:05.062
This was done by Claire and Anthony.

30:05.082 --> 30:05.282
Okay.

30:05.302 --> 30:12.713
We're holding here a large, beautiful, look at the condition letter.

30:13.115 --> 30:16.999
Dear Sir, Monday noon, 30 August, 1779.

30:17.159 --> 30:20.462
It is signed by John Hancock.

30:21.103 --> 30:23.105
This is John Hancock's John Hancock.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.987
That's John Hancock's John Hancock.

30:25.807 --> 30:26.788
Here's the paragraph.

30:26.808 --> 30:27.789
Short paragraph.

30:29.631 --> 30:33.835
I am now preparing my house for the celebration of a wedding this night.

30:37.058 --> 30:38.239
I walked in town today.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.962
I dine on board the French frigate tomorrow.

30:41.330 --> 30:42.952
So you see how I have recovered.

30:43.152 --> 30:47.597
I expect an answer from Miss Eunice, E-O-N-I-C-E, under her own hands.

30:47.717 --> 30:49.739
She may write to a married man.

30:49.759 --> 30:51.321
The Philistines, it starts.

30:51.361 --> 30:54.724
The Philistines are coming upon me on Wednesday next at dinner.

30:55.185 --> 30:59.570
To be serious, the ambassador, et cetera, et cetera, I should dine with you on Wednesday.

30:59.610 --> 31:00.431
This is Lafayette.

31:01.071 --> 31:02.513
This is quite a nice letter.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.013
It's coming.

31:04.014 --> 31:04.555
Lafayette.

31:04.615 --> 31:07.839
Is this in Boston, by the way?

31:07.859 --> 31:08.299
Baltimore.

31:09.072 --> 31:14.500
It's exciting for both members to go to the haven, to go shopping.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.162
And sending his mail.

31:16.183 --> 31:18.366
Both of his servants to Providence Rhode Island.

31:18.646 --> 31:35.451
Well, listen, I must beg the favor of you to recommend to my man, Harry, where he can get some chickens, ducks, geese, hams, partridges, mutton, or anything, that's anything, two words, that will save my reputation in a dinner, and by all means, some butter.

31:35.887 --> 31:38.970
Be so good as to help me, and you will much oblige me.

31:38.990 --> 31:41.813
Is there any good melons or peaches or any good fruit near you?

31:42.173 --> 31:44.356
Your advice to Harry will much oblige me.

31:44.376 --> 31:46.017
Excuse me, I am very troublesome.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.400
Can I get a good turkey?

31:48.420 --> 31:49.141
That's wonderful.

31:49.161 --> 31:58.030
You can see that Mrs. Hancock stands there, the coordinator tells you what to write.

31:58.831 --> 32:00.272
Excuse me, I am very troublesome.

32:00.312 --> 32:02.955
Can I get a good turkey?

32:02.975 --> 32:03.075
Yeah.

32:03.342 --> 32:07.788
Let me read the one, I think it's just one line paragraph.

32:07.889 --> 32:12.255
God bless you if you've seen anything good at Providence, do buy it for you.

32:12.275 --> 32:20.707
So he's sending someone to Baltimore to get the other servant in New Haven to go to Providence shopping because this is the center of the colonial market.

32:20.727 --> 32:21.348
This has come home.

32:22.590 --> 32:23.331
That's wonderful.

32:24.092 --> 32:25.735
And this document came home.

32:26.195 --> 32:27.577
This document came home.

32:28.058 --> 32:28.599
Two problems.

32:28.679 --> 32:29.981
Two problems.

32:30.001 --> 32:30.902
Part of the building.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.084
after the fate of the book.

32:34.524 --> 32:35.746
And do you feel good about that?

32:36.047 --> 32:37.489
I feel very good about that.

32:37.509 --> 32:38.471
Yeah.

32:38.491 --> 32:41.155
This is a very, this is an archival thing, too.

32:41.175 --> 32:44.500
This is very, it's very nice.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.442
Congratulations.

32:46.123 --> 32:48.627
Bill of Fear, Lincoln's inaugural ball.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.594
Boy, you've got some nice stuff.

32:53.614 --> 32:55.658
Only three copies of this.

32:55.678 --> 32:57.801
Three copies of this exist, Annette.

32:58.895 --> 33:04.882
Bill of Fear of the Presidential Inauguration Ball in the city of Washington, D.C.

33:04.902 --> 33:06.564
on the 6th of March, 1865.

33:07.064 --> 33:10.208
Fresh by G.A.

33:10.348 --> 33:12.610
Balzer, confectioner, B.A.L.Z.R.

33:13.311 --> 33:19.418
The great-grandson of Balzer is a friend of mine, and we worked for the same publication for 12 years.

33:20.539 --> 33:22.722
That's quite a nice dinner they had, huh?

33:24.724 --> 33:26.686
And this is the cops.

33:27.427 --> 33:28.328
Lincoln took home.

33:28.544 --> 33:30.486
for his son.

33:30.506 --> 33:31.307
This very one?

33:31.707 --> 33:32.888
This very one.

33:32.908 --> 33:43.399
This very one is, let's say it again, is a copy that Lincoln took home to his son, Bob, and I purchased it from the family of Bob Lincoln.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.120
Through Ralph Wilmer.

33:45.341 --> 33:46.442
Through Ralph Wilmer.

33:46.462 --> 33:50.526
So we know the provenance of this is secure, is certain.

33:50.546 --> 33:50.926
Yes.

33:51.607 --> 33:52.888
That's Lincoln's own copy.

33:53.209 --> 33:55.150
Yes.

33:55.170 --> 33:56.712
That's pretty special.

33:58.177 --> 33:59.078
and Ralph Newman.

34:00.601 --> 34:03.104
That didn't come unexpectedly, I'm sure.

34:03.445 --> 34:04.226
No, no.

34:04.246 --> 34:08.993
He called me, and he said, this is what I'm saying.

34:09.013 --> 34:13.520
You tell him the story about how you always wanted to have a Lincoln, and you couldn't afford it.

34:13.540 --> 34:17.085
You remember Conway, Conway?

34:17.105 --> 34:20.870
Yeah, or Conrad Barker in Texas.

34:21.131 --> 34:21.952
Conway Barker.

34:21.972 --> 34:22.994
Yeah, Conway Barker.

34:23.114 --> 34:25.638
Tell him the story about the Lincoln.

34:26.058 --> 34:27.340
Yeah, but he mailed it.

34:27.758 --> 34:30.080
Yes.

34:30.100 --> 34:34.023
He was a small autograph dealer.

34:34.984 --> 34:35.925
Small, what kind of a dealer?

34:36.245 --> 34:37.767
A autograph dealer.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.088
He used to use the three doors.

34:39.168 --> 34:41.870
They used to get stuff on him and work.

34:41.890 --> 34:45.574
And he wrote to me an oath.

34:45.634 --> 34:52.760
He said, Shepu, you always want to have a legal.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.483
And I could never supply you with one.

34:57.222 --> 35:01.468
Now here is a ring cord, which is not too much work.

35:01.488 --> 35:11.762
And I don't want you to bite, but I want you to hold it in your hand, touch it, keep it there for a while, and then send it back.

35:11.782 --> 35:12.463
You know what you did?

35:12.844 --> 35:13.705
Yeah.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.267
It was just a little signal.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.729
He told you how much it was.

35:16.749 --> 35:21.316
Yeah, it was not food-related, you know, and he know that, but he wants me to hold it.

35:21.336 --> 35:21.876
To hold it.

35:21.896 --> 35:22.477
To hold it.

35:22.557 --> 35:26.723
Because he used to call him up his hand, don't you ever get any of these food?

35:27.462 --> 35:29.384
Yeah, it would be kind of French.

35:30.665 --> 35:38.053
You know, I let you go home, but I would like to tell you a little anecdote, a little story.

35:38.894 --> 35:50.445
When the United States was 200 years old, the ALA, the American Library Association, was 100 years old.

35:51.626 --> 35:56.271
And D. Harvey, Chicago had a fantastic day.

35:57.432 --> 36:04.199
Centennial Convention of the American Library Association.

36:04.219 --> 36:08.403
It was a four-day program from 7 a.m.

36:08.724 --> 36:10.085
till midnight every day.

36:11.927 --> 36:25.701
And one day we had a champagne reception prior to Gala de Merck at the Newberry Library

36:27.301 --> 36:55.722
and the power for me, for assessment, who was the head of the Newberry Library, and a good friend, and Jim Reynolds, who was the director, he called me up and he said, we would like you to donate the copy of the reception

36:56.782 --> 37:08.935
to the Antiquarian book dealers of the world who are coming to Chicago to this convention.

37:08.955 --> 37:17.464
Anybody and everybody who is somebody will be there from Amsterdam, from London, from Paris.

37:18.605 --> 37:19.587
We all will be here.

37:21.028 --> 37:23.751
And we would like you to donate there.

37:24.997 --> 37:27.741
champagne reception and do the champagne reception.

37:30.264 --> 37:39.758
So I bought in Wisconsin a 90-day-old, 130-pound Swiss cheese.

37:40.959 --> 37:47.649
And I carved it into as large a book as you could.

37:47.669 --> 37:53.417
And I called it the holy book because these cheese were full of hope.

37:54.410 --> 38:07.385
And from all that I cut off from the open book, we made all kinds of fine hors d'oeuvres, what you make with cheese, hot hors d'oeuvres and cold hors d'oeuvres.

38:09.787 --> 38:16.395
Because it was in the Newberry Library, I said, I have to create some new berries.

38:16.455 --> 38:23.843
So from a funeral home, I rented some ficus trees, and I bought the largest

38:24.363 --> 38:28.048
Now, what did you rent from them?

38:28.469 --> 38:29.811
Ficus trees.

38:29.891 --> 38:30.672
Ficus.

38:30.692 --> 38:31.152
Ficus.

38:31.173 --> 38:33.295
Okay.

38:33.396 --> 38:36.740
These are very nice trees for children at home.

38:36.901 --> 38:37.281
Trees.

38:38.202 --> 38:39.364
F-I-C-O-S trees.

38:39.504 --> 38:41.867
Okay.

38:41.887 --> 38:47.856
And I bought the Drexler strawberries from California.

38:48.176 --> 38:53.003
The largest strawberries, which are like small lemons or like lime.

38:54.198 --> 39:07.099
And we mixed French Cognac and Cointreau liquor, and with a syringe, with a medical syringe, we injected each one, because we all have a hollow middle.

39:07.379 --> 39:14.330
And with green pipe cleaner, we hung it on the trees.

39:14.350 --> 39:21.842
And we made all kinds of others for this, and I bought five case of Dom Perignon champagne.

39:23.122 --> 39:31.331
And they said, now, you have to give the speech to these people.

39:31.351 --> 39:37.638
It will be a one-hour party, talk about ten minutes, and let them have a fine conversation, and then Joey takes down.

39:38.199 --> 39:43.665
Probably they want to ask some questions and answers.

39:43.685 --> 39:44.966
Then we get the phone call.

39:46.808 --> 39:49.551
When everything was ready and was supposed to arrive,

39:49.936 --> 39:56.786
that this will be 15 minutes late, because their meeting is 15 minutes late.

39:56.806 --> 40:01.132
And then after 15 minutes, we get a phone call.

40:01.152 --> 40:07.461
They just want to leave, but the bus wasn't starting, so it will be another 15 minutes.

40:07.621 --> 40:10.385
They'll be there.

40:10.405 --> 40:15.252
That means that they will have only about 30 minutes for the champagne, the suction.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.192
They have to be someplace afterwards.

40:18.392 --> 40:20.895
Of course, they have to go to the gala, didn't they?

40:22.277 --> 40:32.091
To make a long story short, on the end, they said to me, Louis, you have five minutes to speak, because he didn't be here.

40:32.431 --> 40:37.898
Just for one glass of champagne, they were coming, shake hands, hover by, and they have to go.

40:41.543 --> 40:44.327
Finally, they arrived, and I was told,

40:45.134 --> 40:50.700
that we have to read within 10 minutes.

40:50.720 --> 40:54.885
He said, just say something to these guys.

40:54.905 --> 41:05.096
And I said, gentlemen, it's wonderful to have you all here as our guests.

41:06.017 --> 41:07.318
Welcome to Chicago.

41:08.119 --> 41:09.701
Welcome to the New Valley.

41:11.923 --> 41:12.424
And it is

41:13.096 --> 41:28.074
It's the greatest feeling to be with 75 distinguished people in the same room who all know how do I spell my name from my checks which never bounce.

41:28.575 --> 41:33.621
Thank you very much.

41:33.641 --> 41:36.845
From my checks, they never bounce.

41:37.566 --> 41:40.369
They've been laughing, they've been rolling.

41:40.417 --> 41:45.523
I mean, you know, for a Dutch man to... Too bad that they came.

41:45.583 --> 41:47.185
No, it was wonderful.

41:47.225 --> 41:49.668
You know what was great?

41:50.149 --> 41:52.712
The anticipation waiting for them to come.

41:52.732 --> 41:54.574
And you know what was wonderful?

41:54.834 --> 41:56.716
It wasn't their fault.

41:56.756 --> 42:08.230
When we came back four years later to the United States, to that New York meeting, that book collector whom I talked to you about, Lee Berlin,

42:08.598 --> 42:13.144
He called me one day and he said, Louis, I want to tell you something.

42:14.205 --> 42:27.442
The five greatest books here of the world are flying tomorrow to Chicago to have dinner with you, because we can never forget your speech once again.

42:27.822 --> 42:30.926
And who were they?

42:31.146 --> 42:33.609
I have their autographs.

42:33.950 --> 42:35.191
But they came to visit you?

42:35.512 --> 42:38.115
Yeah, they flew in from New York to Chicago.

42:38.517 --> 42:41.760
to have dinner with me and then flew back to here.

42:41.780 --> 42:42.881
Isn't that nice?

42:42.901 --> 42:43.001
Yeah.

42:43.021 --> 42:44.843
So you've bought from dealers all over the world?

42:45.944 --> 42:46.425
Yeah.

42:46.445 --> 42:48.787
We should show you our dealer file.

42:48.807 --> 42:50.248
Oh, sure.

42:50.268 --> 42:51.089
I'm going to let you go home.

42:51.129 --> 42:51.309
Yeah.

42:51.329 --> 42:51.830
It's 9.30.

42:51.850 --> 42:54.192
I do want to take a couple more quick shots out of the room.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.436
In the apartment, the books you keep.

42:58.456 --> 43:00.578
You look over the shop.

43:00.698 --> 43:00.879
Okay.

43:01.059 --> 43:06.224
And that's my memory.

43:06.244 --> 43:06.484
What?

43:06.944 --> 43:07.545
What I keep.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.972
It's mind-boggling.

43:09.992 --> 43:11.634
It is mind-boggling?

43:11.654 --> 43:15.899
Then I have to see it, don't I?

43:15.919 --> 43:22.506
I want to show you the cookbook, what I flew to Vienna to buy.

43:23.187 --> 43:26.911
And after I bought it, I flew back.

43:28.453 --> 43:30.555
You went to Vienna, bought a book?

43:30.575 --> 43:30.916
Yeah.

43:30.936 --> 43:31.576
And that's at home?

43:32.037 --> 43:33.358
Yeah.

43:34.139 --> 43:35.981
I paid $5,000 for the book.

43:36.001 --> 43:37.363
What is the book?

43:37.765 --> 43:39.708
That's the Salzburger cookbook.

43:40.590 --> 43:44.917
Salzburger cookbook.

43:44.937 --> 43:46.800
What's the word after Salzburg?

43:46.820 --> 43:49.624
Yes, Salzburger, E-R.

43:49.645 --> 43:51.988
Salzburger cookbook.

43:52.008 --> 43:53.170
This must be quite a book.

43:54.132 --> 43:58.800
Well, because the front page is missing, I could get it for a lousy $5,000.

44:00.122 --> 44:04.549
But I already have an offer from a Swiss dealer for $10,000.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.321
Not a bad day.

44:07.723 --> 44:10.325
Yeah, but of course I didn't want to sell it.

44:11.266 --> 44:19.115
But this is a cookbook which was written around the time when Mozart was.

44:19.135 --> 44:20.557
I got a child in Salzburg.

44:21.117 --> 44:21.438
You know?

44:22.859 --> 44:25.462
And I lived in Salzburg for seven years.

44:26.003 --> 44:27.204
And you love Mozart.

44:27.224 --> 44:28.125
You told me about that.

44:28.145 --> 44:30.107
I love Mozart.

44:30.127 --> 44:34.452
And, you know... My mother's license plate

44:34.752 --> 44:38.637
It says most people have vanity plates.

44:38.657 --> 44:40.319
She has Mozart.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.142
Why her own name, Mozart?

44:43.202 --> 44:46.847
That's nice.

44:47.247 --> 44:48.329
All right.

44:48.349 --> 44:49.250
Take a couple pictures.

44:50.451 --> 44:51.713
What kind of skewers?

44:51.853 --> 44:52.994
Cold meat.

44:53.014 --> 44:54.196
Cold meat.

44:54.216 --> 44:55.617
That's for the cold meats.

44:55.738 --> 45:00.003
They show what kind of meat it is.

45:00.263 --> 45:04.388
It is fish or fall or rabbit or lobster.

45:07.557 --> 45:16.371
That's how the back of the day with black brothels, coke scone, and different aspects of the street.

45:16.391 --> 45:17.152
You know what's this?

45:18.054 --> 45:20.458
That's really for the sportsman.

45:20.478 --> 45:25.105
This is a cocktail shaker.

45:27.248 --> 45:32.837
An art, back of cocktail shaker.

45:32.857 --> 45:33.919
That's to keep the ice.

45:38.590 --> 45:54.313
I'm just going to take a couple more shots.

45:54.333 --> 45:58.419
And I just, I got a lot of pictures out here.

45:59.260 --> 46:01.183
I think what I want is just to get a long one.

46:02.725 --> 46:04.868
This place is just a cavernous

46:07.193 --> 46:14.002
Just to give some idea of the... of the size of this thing.

46:28.101 --> 46:30.144
We have a list collection that you're doing... Franslitz.

46:30.164 --> 46:30.544
Franslitz.

46:30.704 --> 46:31.325
Franslitz.

46:31.345 --> 46:33.007
Do you give that to Howard Gottlieb?

46:33.027 --> 46:33.488
Yeah.

46:33.508 --> 46:34.389
Yeah, I know Howard.

46:36.091 --> 46:36.492
I will.

46:37.248 --> 46:40.315
And you said, what was the Transylvania collection?

46:40.336 --> 46:41.799
No, that's a joke.

46:41.819 --> 46:43.223
What was the joke saying for the kid?

46:44.586 --> 46:50.119
I said, did you ever have heard of my Transylvania silver and gold collection?

46:50.140 --> 46:52.405
Okay, I didn't know.
