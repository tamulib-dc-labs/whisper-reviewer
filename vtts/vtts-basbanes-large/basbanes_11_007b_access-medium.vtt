WEBVTT

00:04.013 --> 00:06.055
Okay.

00:08.898 --> 00:17.245
Well, I'm not going to tell you the incident because it would look trivial in terms of the 23 years since.

00:17.285 --> 00:24.852
The fact is I just had what probably would have and should have been a routine complaint.

00:24.912 --> 00:29.456
A service complaint?

00:29.477 --> 00:30.638
Yeah, service complaint.

00:30.658 --> 00:31.118
Access complaint?

00:31.638 --> 00:33.380
Yeah, not even involving myself.

00:33.400 --> 00:39.525
You know, I saw somebody else treated in a way that was, you know, not appropriate.

00:39.545 --> 00:48.013
I'm a respectable citizen, you know, so I'll kind of take their part in complaining about it.

00:48.113 --> 00:52.076
And that's kind of when I saw the attitude.

00:53.117 --> 00:57.241
Yes, at that point, yes.

00:57.421 --> 01:00.784
And it should have been handled just like a routine complaint.

01:01.355 --> 01:17.998
Oh God, if you're impressed with me this far, let me tell the story.

01:18.118 --> 01:23.245
Let me get a coffee and I'll tell you the story.

01:25.064 --> 01:32.371
But in fact, I have the preferences again by saying I'm not obsessed by this thing that happened 23 years ago.

01:32.391 --> 01:37.075
It was just the kind of key under the mattress that got me started.

01:37.756 --> 01:45.463
I came in the right one day and I was researching through old newspapers for something historical.

01:45.563 --> 01:50.228
I had an idea I was going to do an article for something.

01:50.508 --> 01:54.632
So I went up to the microfiche and a couple of kids came up and they must have been about 10.

01:55.439 --> 02:00.984
And I remember there were three of them.

02:01.004 --> 02:10.594
And I was kind of casually dressed, so they kind of looked over my shoulder, and they said, hey, mister, what are you doing?

02:10.614 --> 02:11.715
And I said, well, I'm looking for something.

02:11.955 --> 02:13.697
And I showed them.

02:14.778 --> 02:15.559
And actually, yeah, microphone.

02:15.579 --> 02:24.347
And if you remember, all the newspapers are fascinating because they're so different from the way they are now.

02:24.367 --> 02:25.328
The cartoons are all different.

02:25.848 --> 02:36.221
In those days, they have pictures of all the brides, wedding announcements, things like that, which is really fascinating because you see a different world.

02:37.803 --> 02:40.907
So I said to one of these kids, when were you born?

02:41.208 --> 02:44.011
You know, it's really nice to look at a newspaper at the day you were born.

02:44.792 --> 02:54.505
So I said, you know, just go this thing out and put the date and take it to that person over there and we'll set this thing out and we'll show the newspaper the day you were born.

02:55.244 --> 02:58.067
And the kids thought that was cool.

03:00.869 --> 03:03.732
The kids thought that was cool.

03:03.812 --> 03:14.502
So a janitor comes along and unplugs their machine.

03:14.522 --> 03:18.586
And I looked at this guy and he said, you're just playing.

03:18.606 --> 03:21.609
He unplugged the kids' machine, not my machine.

03:21.629 --> 03:22.210
I was back to doing my thing.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.812
And so he unplugged the kids' machine and said,

03:25.282 --> 03:27.391
that you're not serious, you're just playing.

03:27.993 --> 03:31.989
Well, at that point, he's making an intellectual judgment.

03:32.009 --> 03:33.355
He's making a judgment.

03:33.375 --> 03:34.600
He was making a judgment.

03:35.373 --> 03:39.919
about something I consider very basic, which is intellectual curiosity.

03:39.939 --> 03:41.361
You know, you don't need a reason.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.446
Well, I totally agree with you.

03:45.466 --> 03:45.687
Guess what?

03:45.707 --> 03:46.247
Guess what?

03:46.287 --> 03:47.709
We don't have a topic here.

03:47.829 --> 03:50.453
So at that point, I was pretty secure in my ground, right?

03:50.473 --> 03:54.138
So I didn't see the librarian be called.

03:54.218 --> 04:01.127
Well, I had the librarian call, assuming she was going to take our part, and she asked these kids to leave.

04:01.343 --> 04:08.851
Yes, in a library-like way.

04:08.871 --> 04:28.212
And actually, after the librarian, whoever that librarian was, I don't even know him, asked them to leave, they came up to me on their way out, and they said, hey, thank you very much, mister, and then left.

04:29.069 --> 04:34.916
And, you know, my image was that these kids, you know, got the impression that they're not welcome to the library.

04:34.956 --> 04:36.779
Maybe they never came back their whole lives.

04:36.899 --> 04:37.400
Who knows?

04:37.420 --> 04:38.481
I mean, they were only 10.

04:38.501 --> 04:39.843
I think that's a great story.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.566
With all due respect.

04:42.586 --> 04:42.746
Right.

04:43.247 --> 04:44.589
With all due respect.

04:44.609 --> 04:45.269
Right.

04:45.290 --> 04:50.436
Well, I remember my first library experience with great funness in London.

04:50.888 --> 04:51.749
Right.

04:51.769 --> 04:55.795
Well, my image at the time was... These kids went in and they were denied.

04:55.855 --> 04:58.318
That's right.

04:58.719 --> 05:05.488
My image was that when I was 10, you know, somebody would have stuck up for me.

05:05.548 --> 05:08.452
So I'm going to stick up for these kids, right?

05:08.472 --> 05:10.395
Well, why didn't you want to tell?

05:10.415 --> 05:11.116
That's a good story.

05:11.136 --> 05:11.597
I like that story.

05:11.777 --> 05:13.620
Well, let me tell you the rest of it.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.601
But I mean, the reason is obvious.

05:14.621 --> 05:16.103
It makes it look like I...

05:16.673 --> 05:36.252
you know, 23 years of revenge or something.

05:36.272 --> 05:37.953
It's actually much bigger, richer, intellectual stories than that.

05:37.974 --> 05:41.537
Well, I see it is, because Porter suggested to me that something happened personal to you, and that's why you're only going to let it.

05:41.557 --> 05:42.558
And, you know, I'm saying, what the hell happened?

05:42.578 --> 05:43.078
You know what I'm saying?

05:43.098 --> 05:44.059
Is it going to make life miserable for the city?

05:44.079 --> 05:44.620
It's an intellectual issue.

05:44.640 --> 05:44.740
Good.

05:44.720 --> 05:53.170
So anyway, the really crucial thing was that I took this, and I was going to make a complaint about this.

05:53.190 --> 05:56.174
I figured, well, there's a board of trustees, there's a commission, there's something.

05:56.194 --> 06:00.219
I didn't even know what they were called.

06:00.239 --> 06:03.443
I'll find out what they are, and I'll let them know that this is what's going on in the library.

06:03.463 --> 06:13.495
So I go into the city librarian's office, and they tell me that there's no such thing as a library commission, and throw me out.

06:14.099 --> 06:42.520
so you know and then it took me like two months to prove that there was a library commission and i had a right to go and you know and then the rest is history so anyway that's how it all started and so then as you started to go to these meetings you started to see the types of things yeah now is this this is something that you do as i mean it does consume a lot of the time

06:43.765 --> 06:47.989
It changed a lot of my time, probably less than you imagined.

06:48.009 --> 06:56.856
I mean, I work, I have hobbies, I read, you know, I'm taking up social dancing right now.

06:57.517 --> 07:01.740
So, you know, I'm not obsessed.

07:01.760 --> 07:07.505
Right, I mean, I'm not, I don't do it to the exclusion of other normal activities.

07:08.586 --> 07:13.350
It's a major activity of mine, but it doesn't blot out the rest of my life.

07:14.090 --> 07:22.438
And you keep doing it, Indiana, until... Until I become... Satisfied.

07:22.458 --> 07:29.425
Well, I mean, actually, I've played around at various times with the idea of giving it up.

07:29.445 --> 07:33.949
And in fact, I may give it up at some time.

07:33.969 --> 07:40.135
I don't know exactly... You know, I would like to think that at some point I'll be like Malcolm Bagan.

07:40.155 --> 07:43.118
I mean, everybody will agree with me so much that I'll become...

07:43.587 --> 07:50.397
or a respectable citizen or, you know, just back in the mainstream again instead of the extreme radical.

07:50.618 --> 07:59.271
People would, you know, I don't think a person with my views should be regarded as an extreme radical.

07:59.351 --> 08:01.033
And that, in a sense, is the issue.

08:01.053 --> 08:11.569
I mean, why have the issues gone so much in closer's direction that I'm an extreme radical?

08:12.292 --> 08:23.905
You know, I mean, just if the system, that's what I'm really looking for, is I'm looking for the whole system to move back into what I would call the liberal direction.

08:23.925 --> 08:28.791
I'm not sure I'm going to wait until that happens before I stop going.

08:30.333 --> 08:38.722
And in fact, I've often thought that, you know, at some point I will probably, you know, say enough, enough is enough.

08:38.742 --> 08:40.324
I don't know exactly when that will be.

08:40.692 --> 09:00.713
I don't have any trigger for that, but, you know, I don't expect to go to my grave necessarily doing this.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.335
Although 23 years is a damn long time.

09:03.355 --> 09:04.056
You mind by asking how old you are?

09:04.076 --> 09:04.216
I'm 50.

09:04.236 --> 09:04.296
50?

09:04.316 --> 09:04.777
I'll be 51 in November.

09:04.797 --> 09:05.878
So I'm older than you are.

09:05.898 --> 09:05.998
Yeah.

09:06.018 --> 09:07.780
This started when you're, you know, not historically, in your 20s, or 30s.

09:08.485 --> 09:10.708
Must have been 26.

09:13.491 --> 09:14.773
I don't know.

09:14.793 --> 09:17.456
Are you a professional man?

09:17.476 --> 09:18.798
You said you're a consultant?

09:18.918 --> 09:21.982
Yeah, I'm a consultant.

09:22.202 --> 09:26.187
For lack of a better kind.

09:26.207 --> 09:26.407
I'm sorry?

09:26.427 --> 09:27.088
For lack of a better description.

09:27.328 --> 09:27.709
How you from there?

09:27.729 --> 09:28.850
Are you a West Coast person or just a French person?

09:28.870 --> 09:34.177
Well, actually, I have to admit that I was an Army grad as a child.

09:34.197 --> 09:36.339
And we ended up in San Diego.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.581
So I spent my high school

09:37.882 --> 09:45.911
and after years in San Diego.

09:46.252 --> 09:54.020
Went to college in Portland, Oregon.

09:54.121 --> 09:59.186
But I was born in Texas, and most of my childhood years were spent in Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas.

09:59.206 --> 09:59.887
So did you use libraries as a kid?

09:59.907 --> 10:01.970
Used a lot of libraries as a kid, yes.

10:01.990 --> 10:03.191
Were you a reader, a serious reader?

10:03.211 --> 10:04.092
Yeah, I consider myself a serious reader.

10:05.506 --> 10:08.670
you'd be able to send me some materials?

10:08.790 --> 10:13.976
I'll send you lots and lots of materials.

10:14.056 --> 10:25.150
Well, I've got the impression that you want some background material on Furman and his, uh... Right.

10:25.170 --> 10:34.281
And actually, some of the stuff in here is relatively specific as far as actual quotations, you know,

10:34.953 --> 10:39.480
What was at issue in the suits or, you know, in italics?

10:40.041 --> 10:44.968
But I'd kind of like to see the suits themselves.

10:44.988 --> 10:45.088
Sure.

10:45.108 --> 10:49.215
Even if they have the file numbers, too, the case numbers?

10:49.235 --> 10:49.435
Sure.

10:49.756 --> 10:50.997
And where they were filed.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.480
Were they all filed in the Cyber Court?

10:52.500 --> 10:52.840
Oh, yeah.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.324
The Superior Court of San Francisco.

10:58.780 --> 11:10.351
And do you feel, have you, developed any allies at this?

11:10.371 --> 11:11.693
Oh yeah, lots of allies.

11:12.974 --> 11:16.958
Do you feel like you're a shovel and you don't want to get to tie it by yourself, so to speak?

11:16.978 --> 11:18.780
Well, I mean, there was a long time when I was.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.741
You were at Cassandra right there.

11:20.761 --> 11:20.842
Yes.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.283
And all of us.

11:22.303 --> 11:23.184
For a long time.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.386
But in fact, I've got lots of allies now.

11:25.406 --> 11:27.488
I mean, there's a whole group of, uh, uh,

11:28.396 --> 11:42.815
what we call the Ida Seeder group, and Andrea Grimes, and you know, people like that, and... Nick Baker.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.497
Nick Baker, and... Ian Bowe, I think.

11:44.978 --> 11:45.318
Ian Bowe.

11:45.338 --> 11:50.064
I said, you know, the man, looking at the stuff now that he said, he was right.

11:50.084 --> 11:50.445
Well, that's nice.

11:50.465 --> 11:50.725
Nice to hear.

11:50.705 --> 12:15.373
That's the claims on the record that you were ahead of your time, not preceding you.

12:15.393 --> 12:15.733
That's very nice.

12:15.753 --> 12:16.614
And where did you go to school in Portland?

12:16.634 --> 12:16.734
Read.

12:16.754 --> 12:17.035
Read, L-E-E-D?

12:17.055 --> 12:17.135
Yes.

12:17.155 --> 12:17.755
It's a very well-known school.

12:17.775 --> 12:19.257
I write a weekly book on one of my papers, The Registered Guard of Eugene.

12:19.277 --> 12:20.138
I've got 22 newspapers, so it's very weird.

12:21.518 --> 12:22.919
That's right.

12:22.939 --> 12:25.021
Do you think you pretty well covered it here?

12:25.041 --> 12:25.482
Ah, yes.

12:26.142 --> 12:35.872
Actually, I want to say again that there is one other thing I want to add.

12:35.892 --> 12:49.585
The major double clause that had to do with all of this, the way all of this happened, is that when the Library Foundation came into existence, one of the confessions

12:50.780 --> 13:06.874
that was granted, and it was a very solemn promise, and that was that the Library Foundation would go out of existence, would dissolve, after it had achieved its function.

13:06.894 --> 13:08.495
And that was a very solemn promise.

13:08.595 --> 13:20.365
It came out of the mouth of Margaret Stone, came out of the mouth of Steve Colbert, came out of the mouth of Ken Dowling, came out of the mouth of Martin Paley, and everybody else involved, was that the Library Foundation

13:21.155 --> 13:24.561
It was supposed to self-destruct.

13:24.721 --> 13:29.529
It was supposed to self-destruct.

13:32.574 --> 13:35.259
When it achieved its mission, it would dissolve itself.

13:35.800 --> 13:43.152
And it's actually the betrayal of that promise which has been the cause of all the trouble.

13:43.172 --> 13:46.217
And that was a major double-cross.

13:47.260 --> 13:53.929
Like everybody involved.

13:53.949 --> 13:58.095
How do you feel about these infinity rooms?

13:59.237 --> 14:00.859
Oh, that's the process.

14:00.879 --> 14:02.742
You know, that's an abomination.

14:02.762 --> 14:04.044
I've never seen anything like that.

14:04.064 --> 14:06.827
That's an abomination as far as I'm concerned.

14:06.847 --> 14:10.673
It's an intellectual travesty as well as a social service travesty.

14:10.693 --> 14:13.176
I mean, it's a public service travesty.

14:13.977 --> 14:14.398
It's a travesty.

14:14.918 --> 14:37.945
Because basically what it says is, you can determine the course of intellectual inquiry, of scholarly inquiry, by giving X and O dollars to establish the Filipino-American movement.

14:37.966 --> 14:40.909
And as a matter of fact, if you go back to Steve Coulter's original presentations, he was very specific about

14:42.863 --> 14:55.737
What he would probably now characterize as being applied for that was actually a very explicit threat, which is, fine, you want black history in the library?

14:55.797 --> 14:56.417
Let's see the bucks.

14:57.358 --> 14:59.981
You know, you want to see Filipino history in the library?

15:00.001 --> 15:00.642
Let's see the bucks.

15:01.503 --> 15:07.849
You know, because if you don't come up with a, you know, donation, there might not be black history in the library.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.453
You know, he was very forthcoming about that.

15:12.192 --> 15:18.544
You know, that's an abomination as far as I'm concerned.

15:18.564 --> 15:34.155
And not only that, but there was supposed to be a labor affinity group for the labor movement.

15:34.175 --> 15:34.335
Right.

15:34.703 --> 15:40.289
Well, it didn't go anywhere.

15:43.153 --> 15:49.179
Maybe the threat's been realized.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.303
Is there less attention to labor?

15:53.204 --> 15:56.948
Yes.

15:57.653 --> 16:15.652
He says, man, who are you talking to today?

16:15.672 --> 16:19.136
I said, with all due respect, you could name 20 games and you might be right on about 16.

16:19.156 --> 16:19.917
Because I am trying to send everybody.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.538
I said, so there's no, there's no whispering about it.

16:21.558 --> 16:22.619
You know, I am a fair person.

16:22.639 --> 16:23.921
But I'm not going to confirm for you who they are.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.062
But you got to realize that back in these days,

16:25.042 --> 16:31.472
They thought they were going to go, like, to the garment workers or the teachers and, you know, get them to come up with and go re-meet.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.959
He wasn't talking about the librarians, you know.

16:35.979 --> 16:40.166
But, you know, labor press history would be a labor press history.

16:40.186 --> 16:41.388
Right, and it still is.

16:41.608 --> 16:42.890
And it still is.

16:42.910 --> 16:48.740
And the idea that, well, they didn't come through with the authority room, so... So we need to go re-meet.

16:49.741 --> 16:50.222
Yeah.

16:51.535 --> 17:05.798
and as i say in the early days they were very explicit about that okay so i think you know with that addition i think we have covered
