00:06.123 --> 00:08.486
Ready?

00:08.586 --> 00:16.055
The Mary Lincoln part of it, Justin Turner and his daughter-in-law wrote The Life and Letters of Mary Todd Lincoln.

00:16.716 --> 00:19.499
And what it is, I can see it on the shelf right there.

00:20.841 --> 00:27.829
They located almost every letter that Mary Lincoln wrote that they could find.

00:27.869 --> 00:29.251
There were over 600 letters.

00:30.152 --> 00:32.475
And put it together in a book.

00:34.517 --> 00:36.079
And did the research on it.

00:37.713 --> 00:40.297
You could read the inscription, what they wrote to me.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.364
Well, I want to come out with a book like that for $15 in the morning.

00:48.268 --> 00:52.374
For Louise Cooper, who knows more about Lincoln than we do.

00:53.656 --> 00:54.498
That was years ago.

00:54.538 --> 00:55.379
With much affection.

00:55.419 --> 00:59.104
And these are the authors.

00:59.945 --> 01:02.149
Justin Turner and Luther Turner.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.412
Who knows more about Lincoln than we do.

01:05.017 --> 01:11.003
So then I became obsessed with how collectors collected, Lincoln collectors.

01:11.223 --> 01:21.494
I had other items, and I sold them, and I kept just a few things, but mostly everything is Lincoln, and I got rid of all the trivia that wasn't Lincoln-related.

01:22.134 --> 01:30.723
And then I decided I wanted to have the greatest Lincoln collection ever, but I wanted every phase.

01:31.043 --> 01:34.787
At what point did you decide that it was possible to do this?

01:37.298 --> 01:40.042
Probably about, what, three, four years ago?

01:41.004 --> 01:41.264
Three?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.668
Something like that.

01:44.349 --> 01:51.360
Because everyone in the Lincoln world was thrilled that someone was so focused on Lincoln and a woman.

01:52.582 --> 01:57.189
So everyone came to me, and it was fabulous.

01:57.749 --> 02:03.498
And I happened to luck out and pick up a ton of things by private people.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.922
Very lucky.

02:06.931 --> 02:23.940
The booth started where a dealer called me and said, you once asked me to find you something unique about women, because you're a woman collector, and there aren't that many women collectors, and I don't know about any Lincoln women collectors.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.382
Well, you're probably the only one.

02:26.364 --> 02:27.606
And so...

02:28.092 --> 02:53.307
she had this mary surat letter so i said to her how do you know it's mary surat and she said by the content well come on anyone content i want to know by the writing first so i called springfield and i asked tom schwartz how would i authenticate a mary surat letter and he said there's a surat society so then i phoned them and before you knew it we became good friends and

02:53.725 --> 03:08.727
She led me to all these Boothies and Surat people, and it took about three weeks of working day and night, every day, and I finally got it authenticated, and everyone was thrilled about it because it was the only one in private hands, so I bought it.

03:09.808 --> 03:21.285
Well, then later on I get a phone call from one of my contacts, and they said that there was a group of love letters written by John Wilkes Booth,

03:21.940 --> 03:48.842
unknown woman unknown romance nine months before the president was assassinated and a woman in denver had them for sale and offered them to ford's theater and they couldn't afford to buy it was i interested well yes i was because they were love letters i was curious so i phoned the woman and we started talking and she said all these dealers called her up it's been passed down in her family

03:49.058 --> 03:51.500
And there were signed cart-to-visits from Booth.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.441
She has everything.

03:52.501 --> 03:53.562
It was her great-grandmother.

03:54.383 --> 03:59.987
And she was told to save them for a rainy day.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.109
And if they ever needed money, sell them.

04:02.890 --> 04:06.033
And it was a rainy day because in Denver, property went.

04:06.493 --> 04:07.514
And she needed the money.

04:08.395 --> 04:10.216
So I said, has anyone flown out there?

04:10.476 --> 04:11.497
And she said, no.

04:12.178 --> 04:13.439
So I got on a plane.

04:13.459 --> 04:14.520
I said, can I come see you?

04:14.620 --> 04:17.102
And the next day, I was on a plane with my husband.

04:17.122 --> 04:18.103
And we went out there.

04:18.590 --> 04:28.785
And we looked at them, and we had till 2 in the afternoon to make our deal because if we didn't, she wanted cash, so the money had to be wired, transferred.

04:29.406 --> 04:30.347
We didn't make a deal.

04:31.208 --> 04:32.090
We didn't make a deal.

04:32.150 --> 04:38.719
Not cash, but she wanted a cashier's check, and I couldn't take one because we didn't agree on the price.

04:39.761 --> 04:43.586
So we left.

04:44.488 --> 04:46.130
Three days later, I called her.

04:46.290 --> 04:47.111
We spoke again.

04:47.131 --> 04:48.293
We agreed on it.

04:48.644 --> 04:56.233
The reason she sold it to me, she said, more than anyone else, was dealers only wanted the Booth letters.

04:56.274 --> 04:58.396
They wanted nothing about her great-grandmother.

04:59.538 --> 05:02.081
I looked at it and said, oh my God, this is a book.

05:03.302 --> 05:09.210
And I'm in the process of writing the book now with John Roadhamel, who's the curator of American Manuscripts at the Huntington.

05:10.231 --> 05:13.315
And the book will have the love letters in it.

05:13.335 --> 05:15.137
Tell me a little bit about the book.

05:15.658 --> 05:17.520
The book will be...

05:17.787 --> 05:20.171
I don't really want to talk about the poster.

05:20.191 --> 05:23.336
I better wait, but the letters will be in the book.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.221
Well, generally speaking, it's about Lincoln, or it's... Booth.

05:26.241 --> 05:27.463
John Wilkes Booth.

05:27.484 --> 05:28.806
A book about John Wilkes Booth.

05:28.826 --> 05:41.888
Because I acquired the letters, so then you have to learn about the girl, about John Wilkes, and I met so many people that I started buying John Wilkes Booth letters privately.

05:42.813 --> 05:44.295
And I have everything on the girl.

05:44.315 --> 05:45.856
I have photographs of her.

05:46.076 --> 05:47.598
I have letters of her.

05:47.838 --> 05:49.580
I have lots of hair of her.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.942
Now this is Surat, right?

05:50.962 --> 05:51.522
No, no.

05:51.542 --> 05:53.484
This is this unknown girl.

05:53.504 --> 05:56.347
Nothing to do with Surat.

05:56.548 --> 05:57.989
But do you have any idea who she is?

05:58.049 --> 05:59.250
Yes.

05:59.751 --> 06:00.312
Oh, yeah.

06:00.332 --> 06:02.454
And you'll reveal this in the book.

06:02.494 --> 06:03.054
In the book.

06:03.074 --> 06:05.237
It'll be in the book.

06:05.257 --> 06:11.183
And so then I met all these booth people and started buying booths.

06:11.686 --> 06:14.388
Not really wanting to collect assassination.

06:14.428 --> 06:15.469
I never wanted to.

06:15.569 --> 06:20.493
So once you've bought John Wilkes, then you have to get all the others.

06:21.154 --> 06:22.735
Why didn't you want to collect assassination?

06:22.755 --> 06:27.419
I liked family and Abraham Lincoln and the happy parts.

06:27.439 --> 06:30.622
But you said you wanted to collect Lincoln and all the facets of his life.

06:30.642 --> 06:34.385
Right, so that's what evolved.

06:34.405 --> 06:41.271
And then when you get into assassination, I have another wanted poster, the original...

06:41.825 --> 06:45.088
small one for the, was it the $30,000 reward.

06:45.128 --> 07:02.406
Then I bought Boston Corbett, then I bought Samuel Arnold, then I bought, and I start, I have carte de visites of, oh God, who else, Harold, all of them.

07:02.666 --> 07:07.911
And then with the carte de visites, I have signed carte de visites in most of Lincoln's cabinet.

07:08.672 --> 07:10.954
But then getting back to the assassination,

07:11.137 --> 07:17.707
led me to all these booth people, so then I would go and tour the booth sites, and got involved in all of that.

07:18.368 --> 07:28.764
Then, when John and I were working on the book, I heard that a private booth theater museum was going up for auction.

07:28.804 --> 07:32.930
The auction was held in Kennebunk, Maine.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.793
That's before Kennebunk Port.

07:35.715 --> 07:36.917
And I flew there.

07:36.937 --> 07:39.861
I had a secretary at the time, and she went with me.

07:40.364 --> 07:47.772
And my husband couldn't go, and I went, really, to read the manuscripts to see if the Booths talked about this young girl.

07:48.793 --> 07:51.756
Well, it ended up, not many people showed up for the auction.

07:52.617 --> 07:57.722
And I was dying because I thought, how could they break up all this Booth family material?

07:58.383 --> 08:01.546
So I bought, I bought a third of the auction, didn't I?

08:01.566 --> 08:01.967
Or half?

08:02.728 --> 08:04.249
And all the stuff, probably.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.612
You haven't seen any of the stuff.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.553
The costume.

08:07.713 --> 08:08.734
But I mean, you bought it all.

08:09.001 --> 08:10.304
I bought it all.

08:10.585 --> 08:23.820
I bought, well, first I wanted one painting, and it started, the option started, and they started, they estimated one of the paintings 15, 8, 10 to 15,000, or 15 to 20,000.

08:24.138 --> 08:25.099
And they started the bidding.

08:25.119 --> 08:26.341
Who'll give me $15,000?

08:26.361 --> 08:27.222
No one answered.

08:27.583 --> 08:28.884
So the guy goes backwards.

08:28.904 --> 08:30.707
Who'll give me $14,000, $13,000, $12,000?

08:31.047 --> 08:32.629
And this whole group is just sitting there.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.091
Who'll give me $1,000?

08:34.492 --> 08:35.533
There's no reserve.

08:35.933 --> 08:40.339
This man let his things be consigned to an option with no reserve.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.142
So then he says, who'll give me $250?

08:42.182 --> 08:43.003
Oh, my God.

08:43.904 --> 08:45.686
I'm going to put my paddle up.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.749
So I ended up buying all the painting.

08:48.117 --> 08:50.980
And the poor man, we had dinner, I had dinner with him that night.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.881
That's a disservice to that.

08:51.901 --> 08:52.902
I'm thrilled for you.

08:53.162 --> 08:55.184
I feel the man was cheated.

08:55.224 --> 08:56.266
It went to the right place.

08:57.106 --> 09:07.457
You know, I mean, let's face it, it's a blessing with respect to the fact that everything is kept together, but I feel terribly for this guy for anxiety, for this place up in Kennebunk, Maine.

09:07.658 --> 09:08.478
Oh, it was awful.

09:08.779 --> 09:10.260
He really took a beating.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.864
Then I called my husband and I said, things are going really cheap.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.186
And he says, well, what do you want?

09:16.206 --> 09:17.668
And I said, I only want...

09:18.020 --> 09:24.948
1865 or earlier, and I only want any of the Booth family.

09:24.988 --> 09:28.092
I don't want Sarah Bernhardt, and I don't want any of the other theater things.

09:28.733 --> 09:34.680
So I ended up getting Mary Devlin, who was the first wife of Edwin Booth.

09:35.401 --> 09:39.226
And Edwin Booth, I got Junius Brutus Booth the father.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.108
I got Junius Brutus Booth the son.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.391
I bought every single Booth playbill.

09:43.471 --> 09:47.976
I probably have, what, 75 playbills of Junius,

09:48.361 --> 09:52.184
And I also, I forget how many I have of John Wilkes.

09:52.204 --> 09:55.728
And just sat there when the auction started.

09:55.748 --> 09:56.709
And I called my husband.

09:56.729 --> 09:57.429
I said, you know what?

09:57.850 --> 09:58.530
It's bombing.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.132
He says, just buy anything you want.

10:00.192 --> 10:00.672
So I did.

10:01.112 --> 10:03.455
And were you unknown to the auctioneers?

10:04.496 --> 10:05.476
They heard.

10:05.516 --> 10:13.624
You must have been quite a cause celeb coming in, this mystery lady, and buying up the whole show.

10:13.644 --> 10:14.825
Yeah, they wrote about it.

10:14.885 --> 10:18.368
It was in the antique...

10:18.803 --> 10:21.867
Main Antique Digest, there were five pages on it.

10:21.927 --> 10:26.373
This lady from Beverly Hills, and then went on and on.

10:26.794 --> 10:47.562
And then I bought, recently, this past year, I will never do this again, we went to an auction in Chicago, and they had a letter written by the man that was doing part of The Undertaker, that did the imbaming, not the imbaming, that did

10:47.710 --> 10:49.312
Yeah, was it the embalming?

10:49.412 --> 10:51.294
Moses Sanford.

10:51.314 --> 10:54.138
And Moses Sanford writes, do you want to show him the letter?

10:54.218 --> 10:56.841
Because there's a piece of the shirt that came off of Lincoln.

10:58.343 --> 11:04.851
And the reason I had to buy that letter was that the letter talked about the cufflinks.

11:05.552 --> 11:06.994
And I had one of the cufflinks.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.397
So that was one letter in the auction.

11:09.417 --> 11:10.618
And what was the other letter?

11:10.638 --> 11:11.880
On banking.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.002
Lincoln talks about banking.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.165
And it's a fabulous letter on banking.

11:16.668 --> 11:18.010
So I had to have that letter.

11:18.610 --> 11:26.279
So they were lot 120-something, and we get to the auction very early, and my husband wants to go shopping.

11:26.299 --> 11:27.300
And I said, then go.

11:27.321 --> 11:30.044
He says, we'll be back before it comes up.

11:30.104 --> 11:31.465
It's going to be an hour and a half.

11:32.006 --> 11:33.428
I said, I'm not going.

11:33.488 --> 11:35.410
If the cab breaks down, forget it.

11:35.530 --> 11:36.671
I'm obsessed with it.

11:37.252 --> 11:38.534
So he leaves.

11:38.554 --> 11:40.496
45 minutes later, it comes up.

11:41.057 --> 11:42.138
And I didn't know what to do.

11:42.558 --> 11:44.421
And a dealer bid against me.

11:44.481 --> 11:45.662
There was a lot of bidding.

11:46.030 --> 12:15.480
and this dealer started bidding against me and i just i kept the panel up became obsessed and bought that so they wrote about that chicago so i bought the moses sanford and i bought the letter on banking and what else one of my other famous pieces we bought the barry and i got the norton letter which is the letter that lincoln wrote saying that

12:17.603 --> 12:24.213
when he lost the Senate race, and he tells his feelings, and he just pours his heart out.

12:24.774 --> 12:28.640
And Mark Neely, have you heard about Mark Neely?

12:28.660 --> 12:34.889
He's with the Lincoln National, what is it, the Lincoln, Life, whatever, it's the Lincoln.

12:34.909 --> 12:36.471
I'm kind of new to Lincoln studies.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.995
He says it's the finest Lincoln letter ever.

12:39.356 --> 12:39.616
This?

12:39.676 --> 12:43.542
No, the other one, the Norton letter that is in the big red case.

12:43.943 --> 12:44.604
We have that.

12:45.024 --> 12:45.585
Has it been...

12:45.835 --> 12:47.077
Printed anywhere?

12:47.157 --> 12:51.041
The Norton letter, they wrote it up in Lincoln lore.

12:55.387 --> 12:56.688
In Lincoln lore, right?

12:57.669 --> 12:58.090
Yeah.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.154
That sounds like quite a letter where he discusses how he feels.

13:01.174 --> 13:01.734
Yeah, sure.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.216
Well, which do you want to see first?

13:03.236 --> 13:04.998
The greatest Lincoln letter ever, huh?

13:05.679 --> 13:07.301
You know, can you get the type script?

13:07.642 --> 13:08.603
Sure.

13:08.623 --> 13:09.103
I'll show you.

13:09.704 --> 13:11.366
And maybe of the Norton one, too.

13:13.008 --> 13:13.449
Oh, you know what?

13:13.489 --> 13:14.610
The Norton one's in here.

13:17.543 --> 13:23.932
But it's... And at the end it says... I think I have all the... I think it's Jesse Norton.

13:26.715 --> 13:29.800
Can you bring the backup on the Norton, Andrea?

13:30.921 --> 13:31.482
Shut up.

13:31.502 --> 13:34.987
Jesse Norton.

13:35.007 --> 13:37.630
It's 16 February.

13:40.775 --> 13:42.397
You've had these cases made, I gather.

13:42.497 --> 13:46.302
Yeah, because then when you do... Let's see, that's...

13:46.906 --> 13:48.428
close the sides of it.

13:48.548 --> 13:54.155
But then this lifts up and goes... Oh, so you can display it.

13:54.195 --> 13:54.996
Isn't that wonderful?

13:55.216 --> 14:05.528
What is... This is... Oh, that's for that.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.772
But this one... For the Norton letter?

14:08.792 --> 14:12.917
Yeah, the Norton one is... Is this something I could get a copy of at some point?

14:13.297 --> 14:13.758
Do you mind?

14:13.798 --> 14:15.580
Or is that...

14:16.235 --> 14:20.599
Is that something you could... Yeah, because it's published.

14:21.079 --> 14:22.421
Andrea, I'm going to give you my card.

14:23.161 --> 14:25.103
Yeah, then we could get you a clean copy.

14:25.163 --> 14:25.543
Great.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.087
Honorable J.O.

14:29.127 --> 14:33.771
Norton, my dear sir, this is February 16, 1855.

14:33.791 --> 14:39.256
I have now been beaten one day over a week, and I'm very happy to find myself quite convalescent.

14:39.796 --> 14:44.841
Your kind letter of the 20th January I did not receive till the day before yesterday, owing...

14:45.023 --> 14:47.245
I suppose, to our great snowstorm.

14:47.705 --> 14:57.775
The day after the election, I wrote Washburn, the particulars, tolerably, fully, through the untiring efforts of friends, among whom yourself and Washburn were chief.

14:58.255 --> 15:05.481
I finally surmounted the difficulty with the extreme anti-slavery men, and I got all their votes, love joys included.

15:05.962 --> 15:13.849
Cook, Judd, and Palmer, and Baker of Alton were the men who never could vote for a Whig, and without the votes of two

15:14.150 --> 15:18.636
of whom I never could reach the requisite number to make an election.

15:19.116 --> 15:30.030
I do not mean that I actually got within two votes of the required number, but I easily enough could have done so, provided I could have assured my friends that two of the above named four would go for me.

15:30.050 --> 15:37.980
In this connection, it is necessary to bear in mind that your Senator Osgood, together with Don Morrison, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

15:38.230 --> 15:44.799
It was Governor Madison's maneuvering that forced upon me, my friends, the necessity of surrendering to Trumbull.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.047
So he turned his votes to Trumbull, and Trumbull became the senator, right?

15:50.067 --> 15:51.048
Wasn't that it?

15:51.068 --> 15:54.273
He made his first successful hit by tampering.

15:54.313 --> 15:56.235
It's a very long letter.

15:57.597 --> 16:00.401
When you read it, it's an incredible letter.

16:01.503 --> 16:06.290
Has there been anything that you've really wanted that you've lost?

16:06.310 --> 16:06.530
No.

16:07.992 --> 16:08.052
No.

16:08.707 --> 16:34.883
not really no no no i haven't have i no no because if you want something you'll you'll pay anything for it if you have to um i thought that was going to be the answer by the way okay let me just find you okay this is he's saying

16:35.251 --> 16:39.017
Dear friend Johnny, you must excuse me for not writing you before.

16:39.077 --> 16:40.900
B-E-F-O-R.

16:41.581 --> 16:44.045
But as the old saying says, better late than never.

16:44.145 --> 16:44.906
So here goes.

16:44.926 --> 16:52.278
I hardly think a letter from this city, especially at this time and from an old friend, will be apt to be thrown to one side and forgotten.

16:52.298 --> 17:01.613
I also send you enclosed in this letter a piece of the shirt bosom worn by the president on the night of his murder and remained on him until he died.

17:02.403 --> 17:05.727
I wish you to give a piece of it to Billy Deaver and Tom Green.

17:06.088 --> 17:16.641
I could sell every inch of it for $5, but prefer dividing it among my friends, and more especially you, Billy and Tom, for I know you will keep and appreciate it also.

17:16.682 --> 17:22.689
Remember the donor, and while looking upon it, recollect that he never forgets his old and true friends.

17:23.270 --> 17:26.955
I have his necktie and would not take $50 for it.

17:27.716 --> 17:30.199
Have been offered $10 for it several times.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.432
I suppose you'd like to know how I came by his clothes.

17:34.073 --> 17:35.014
Is this incredible?

17:35.574 --> 17:43.983
Well, the morning he died, General Rucker came immediately to our shop and had a common pine box made to bring him from 10th Street to the White House.

17:44.744 --> 17:57.638
And after they arrived at the house, there's no period, so it just rambles, to the house, they cut his clothes off of him and threw them in the box we made and sent the box back to the shop for safekeeping.

17:57.938 --> 18:07.030
It was placed in my charge in my room, the hardware department, and just as soon as the coast was clear, I unscrewed the lid and went through the wardrobe for relics.

18:07.531 --> 18:21.990
I found on one of the sleeves of his shirts one of his sleeve buttons, black enamel, trimmed with gold and letter L on the outside with AL underneath that I sent to the Secretary of War.

18:22.050 --> 18:27.878
The bosom of his shirt was the next thing which met my eye as it had considerable blood upon it.

18:28.145 --> 18:30.608
So I just confiscated the whole of the piece.

18:30.748 --> 18:34.553
I send you and another about the same size as all I have left.

18:34.954 --> 18:37.937
The necktie I wouldn't part with under any consideration.

18:38.358 --> 18:48.090
I've taken all the screws out of the box which were turned down on him from 10th to his house and have put others in their place.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.153
I will give you one when I come home.

18:50.352 --> 18:55.257
The box he was brought up in is within five feet of my desk where I'm now writing.

18:55.598 --> 18:57.260
Don't forget to give them da-da-da.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.163
Then he talks about the murder, where it took place.

19:00.663 --> 19:02.425
And he goes all about the body.

19:02.786 --> 19:04.548
And who is this again?

19:04.628 --> 19:07.691
His name was Moses Sanford.

19:07.851 --> 19:10.394
And he worked in the... He wrote the letter to whom?

19:10.574 --> 19:12.737
He wrote the letter to his friend Johnny.

19:13.338 --> 19:14.379
Dear friend Johnny.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.144
And the interesting thing is that the pocket contents

19:19.529 --> 19:21.811
he gave to Stanton.

19:21.831 --> 19:25.055
Stanton gave them to Mary Lincoln.

19:25.075 --> 19:30.761
Mary Lincoln ended up giving one of the cufflink buttons away, which is the one I have.

19:30.941 --> 19:32.743
The rest of the contents stayed.

19:32.783 --> 19:35.065
Then Robert had them in Hildene.

19:35.666 --> 19:44.035
Robert's great-granddaughter, Mary Beckwith, donated the contents of the pockets to the Library of Congress, and that's how they got the rest of it.

19:44.639 --> 19:50.047
Did you have any idea when you started this about 18 years ago that you would become a Lincoln scholar?

19:50.067 --> 19:50.187
No.

19:50.508 --> 19:51.930
Because you are a Lincoln scholar.

19:52.030 --> 19:52.611
Never.

19:53.472 --> 19:53.793
Never.

19:54.314 --> 19:56.477
The true collector does become a scholar, by the way.

19:56.497 --> 19:57.558
Do you agree with that?

19:57.759 --> 19:58.320
Yes.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.001
You have to.

19:59.702 --> 20:01.404
To know your collection.

20:01.464 --> 20:04.970
To know your collection and if you're spending a lot of money.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.393
I like putting things together.

20:07.433 --> 20:13.262
One of the unique things that I did was I bought...

20:13.732 --> 20:43.519
deed that was okay Abraham Lincoln died you know we should get the deed out the deed was in Robert Lincoln's hand it was a quick claim and it he filled it out he wrote Mary Lincoln widow of Abraham Lincoln deceased and what it was is he Robert paid her $500 for this lot in Lincoln Illinois and

20:44.410 --> 20:46.032
I bought this whole deed.

20:46.292 --> 20:49.736
She signed it, and Robert signed it, and it's in Robert's writing.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.819
So I love this deed, and I had been to Lincoln.

20:52.899 --> 20:57.785
I go there because there's Lincoln College, and my husband's now a trustee on the college board.

20:58.966 --> 21:09.598
And I took a picture of the spot where the lot had been, and it's a Sherwin-Williams paint shop with a plaque on the side saying this was owned by Abraham Lincoln.

21:10.639 --> 21:14.383
And one day a dealer calls me up, and he offers me a Lincoln check.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.052
And I said, well, you know, I have several.

21:18.332 --> 21:20.175
I really don't need any more checks.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.620
And he says, well, think about it.

21:24.140 --> 21:26.744
I said, who is the check to and how much is it for?

21:27.365 --> 21:29.408
And he says, it's to a J.G.

21:29.628 --> 21:33.033
Madison, M-A-T-T-E-S-O-N, for $200.

21:33.113 --> 21:35.216
And I said, well, let me call you back.

21:35.977 --> 21:36.798
So I called.

21:36.858 --> 21:42.987
I'm very close friends with Jim Hickey, who was the curator before Tom Schwartz, and he was curator for 30 years.

21:43.507 --> 21:46.792
I called Jim Hickey and I said, you know, someone just offered me this check.

21:47.312 --> 21:48.955
He says, who?

21:49.616 --> 21:50.477
I said, J.G.

21:50.537 --> 21:51.118
Madison.

21:51.138 --> 21:53.481
He says, that was the governor of Illinois.

21:53.922 --> 21:55.103
I said, it's for $200.

21:55.143 --> 21:58.208
He says, oh my God, that's the prim note.

21:58.268 --> 21:59.329
That's your deed.

21:59.470 --> 22:00.571
I said, what do you mean?

22:00.611 --> 22:01.492
What do you mean?

22:01.753 --> 22:06.540
What happens was that this man named Prim wanted to buy that lot.

22:07.481 --> 22:12.127
But even going further back, the people of Lincoln formed this town.

22:12.488 --> 22:12.568
Wow.

22:12.937 --> 22:16.680
And they asked Abraham Lincoln to do the legal work.

22:16.700 --> 22:20.023
He wrote all the papers up to form the town, and he left the name open.

22:20.063 --> 22:22.025
And he said, you didn't give me the name of the town.

22:22.365 --> 22:24.367
They said, we want to call it Lincoln, Illinois.

22:25.068 --> 22:25.949
So he filled it in.

22:26.709 --> 22:28.831
Later on, this man, Prim, came to Lincoln.

22:28.951 --> 22:33.635
Lincoln loaned money to people all the time, and he got good interest, 10%.

22:33.716 --> 22:38.079
So he said, Prim wanted to borrow money.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.582
So Lincoln says, all right, I'll loan you $200.

22:40.622 --> 22:42.083
The lot was $400.

22:42.299 --> 22:44.983
Governor Madison loaned the man for $200.

22:46.004 --> 22:48.988
So Prim owned the lot and owed $400.

22:50.630 --> 22:51.571
Came time to pay it.

22:51.732 --> 22:52.613
Prim couldn't pay it.

22:53.153 --> 22:58.100
So that meant that Lincoln and Madison became the owners of the lot.

22:58.841 --> 23:00.363
Well, Lincoln didn't want a partner.

23:00.403 --> 23:06.671
So this is the check that Lincoln wrote for the $200 to Governor Madison so Lincoln could own the lot.

23:07.352 --> 23:11.698
And then later on, Mary deeded it over to Roberts,

23:12.033 --> 23:16.398
11 days after Robert had it deeded to him, he sold it for $1,100.

23:16.458 --> 23:24.288
He was a pretty smart businessman.

23:24.308 --> 23:29.955
What do you hope to accomplish with the collection?

23:30.015 --> 23:32.318
I mean, do you still have a goal for the collection?

23:33.339 --> 23:38.245
Well, I have almost all the ancestors going back five generations.

23:39.086 --> 23:41.449
I have the great-grandfather,

23:41.817 --> 23:44.060
I have the uncles, great-uncles.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.966
I have almost all of them, don't I?

23:49.068 --> 23:49.809
Descendants.

23:50.009 --> 23:53.755
I've gotten all the descendants, every single one of them.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.018
I have the grandson.

23:56.038 --> 23:58.622
I have them all.

23:58.963 --> 24:03.289
You mean you have documents that relate to them?

24:03.850 --> 24:05.352
That they wrote.

24:06.193 --> 24:10.660
I have a watercolor that one of the granddaughters did.

24:11.517 --> 24:39.465
um i feel i got every phase of his life before and after and even to robert todd lincoln beckwith who was the last in the line um he's the one that owned that piece a lot of the artifacts came through him um what else what are your

24:39.614 --> 24:46.864
My goals are, I looked up all the leading Lincoln collectors and saw how many letters they had.

24:47.524 --> 24:58.479
I counted with Justin Turner how many Lincoln letters Justin had, and I passed him up in Abraham Lincoln letters, so I got excited about that.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.263
How many letters did you say?

25:01.283 --> 25:01.523
Oh, I can't.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.965
I don't want to be quoted, so I won't.

25:03.005 --> 25:03.425
A lot.

25:04.287 --> 25:08.372
And then, with the Mary Lincoln, I am...

25:08.875 --> 25:35.187
five away of passing just enough and he really had the largest mary lincoln collection ever um so there's a competition here in your mind yeah i mean you want to be number one right now i tom says tom schwartz says that i have the largest lincoln collection in private hands and the largest unpublished

25:35.622 --> 26:05.258
collection which will basically soon be published probably because i i i like to share what i have i feel that if it's unpublished you know people some dealers will say it's worth more money if it's not published i disagree i think if it's published and known then you know they can't say well where did you get it you know there's no doubt about it yeah well then then the question is it may be it may be worth more money but but you're doing a disservice to scholarship exactly

26:05.660 --> 26:13.027
I mean, if it's important to know what you have and what you're keeping it, like Folger was that way with his Shakespeare stuff.

26:13.047 --> 26:15.989
He wouldn't let anybody get to see his thing.

26:16.189 --> 26:19.212
Then I got obsessed with anything with Lincoln's friends.

26:19.272 --> 26:21.114
I have letters of all his friends.

26:23.396 --> 26:29.561
The Lincolns had a child named Eddie, and Eddie was named after Edward Baker.

26:30.442 --> 26:33.625
And Eddie died before he was four years old in Springfield.

26:34.162 --> 27:03.713
and baker died at balls bluff and the baker's son-in-law son and there were three baker relatives that wanted an appointment and they wrote to lincoln and i love the way lincoln would write things i own all three of the letters uh he would write i really think that this person deserves to have this position he goes and then he ends it i want this done

27:04.030 --> 27:30.375
so you didn't have a choice he was short and he was to the point and so i bought all of those um what else would be interesting of what i well i was thinking about terms of personal things that the relationship between mary and her son robert and some of the fiery stuff that went on after she was institutionalized right okay i i became obsessed with mary too um

27:31.216 --> 27:58.675
she i bought a letter that that was like one of the most famous letters that she wrote and it said um this is four days after she was declared sane and she writes robert t lincoln give me back my diamonds my laces my moses and the bulrushes and all these things that you and your wife appropriated for me

27:58.908 --> 28:05.455
And my preacher friends are praying for your soul and for the wicked deed you did to your mother.

28:05.835 --> 28:06.876
And she goes on and on.

28:06.896 --> 28:08.498
She signs it, Mrs. A. Lincoln.

28:08.518 --> 28:11.441
Well, I hated Robert after that.

28:11.461 --> 28:26.637
Well, as I got more involved in living in Springfield and spending a lot of time there and doing a lot of research, they have, it was found in Hilding, which was Robert Lincoln's home, letterpress books.

28:26.988 --> 28:54.818
and there's probably 25 30 letters it's like everything from like 1860 till he died and you go through it and i've started reading them and i always hated robert and everyone there loves him and they said if you start reading them you'll realize why well it was explained to me that even though i love mary and i'm defending her as a woman when robert got the letter robert was so organized he thought

28:55.625 --> 29:20.788
diamonds and laces wait a minute Robert saved everything he'd go pull the letter out and it would be from his mother Robert go into this trunk that's in such and such place and you can have this for you and your wife take this painting take this thing so then when he gets this letter he can't understand why she's doing that plus I just bought a letter that he wrote to Gideon Wells secretary of the Navy

29:21.055 --> 29:22.898
And he says it's in 1870.

29:23.379 --> 29:31.053
It's right at the time she's in the institution, which was a beautiful private sanitarium in Batavia.

29:31.975 --> 29:35.060
And he says, my mother is at more peace than ever.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.803
She's rested.

29:36.883 --> 29:37.825
She's happy.

29:37.865 --> 29:38.787
She's wonderful.

29:39.227 --> 29:40.690
I visit her all the time.

29:40.710 --> 29:45.679
So you see, it's like, hey, who do you believe?

29:45.878 --> 29:47.581
But you've taken the extra step.

29:47.681 --> 29:50.587
You've gone to find the other part of the correspondence.

29:51.689 --> 29:51.809
Yeah.

29:51.989 --> 29:53.252
Even though you can't have it.

29:53.913 --> 29:55.335
I mean, you can't own it, right?

29:55.436 --> 29:55.896
I bought it.

29:56.037 --> 29:56.918
I got that letter.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.541
Oh, you got the other part.

29:58.601 --> 29:58.982
Oh, yes.

29:59.002 --> 30:01.206
Oh, I thought you just went to read it.

30:01.226 --> 30:01.767
No, I bought it.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.029
I bought it.

30:03.110 --> 30:03.731
I bought it.

30:03.791 --> 30:05.013
No, I buy them.

30:05.093 --> 30:07.718
I buy everything I can get.

30:07.985 --> 30:13.090
Now, why do you have the place in Springfield to go and research, though?

30:13.210 --> 30:17.575
I made so many friends, and I love the people of Illinois.

30:17.815 --> 30:22.320
Justin trained me and said, Illinois is home, and you'll see why.

30:22.380 --> 30:27.585
And the more you get involved in Lincoln, the more you will like the people.

30:27.806 --> 30:29.587
But, I mean, you go there to do research, I gather.

30:29.607 --> 30:30.929
No, I have so many friends.

30:30.969 --> 30:31.970
They're like family now.

30:32.010 --> 30:33.492
I go there to be with them, too.

30:33.592 --> 30:33.992
Plus...

30:34.445 --> 30:41.572
There's Lincoln College board meetings four times a year, and now I have board meetings for the things I'm involved in, and I have friends there.

30:41.992 --> 30:44.134
So it's my place to relax.

30:44.154 --> 30:46.696
But the apartment then became obsessed with that.

30:47.137 --> 30:50.460
The apartment is in a building that was called the St.

30:50.480 --> 30:54.564
Nicholas Hotel, that was a famous hotel at the time of Lincoln.

30:55.084 --> 31:03.372
And Lincoln sat for the Jones bus, that's the Jones bus, the white one there, in that hotel.

31:03.875 --> 31:08.600
So my apartment, the entry hall of my apartment, is part of the original building.

31:09.721 --> 31:12.383
So, you know, the building was for sale.

31:12.403 --> 31:17.328
We tried to buy that, but there was a problem, so we couldn't get that.

31:17.348 --> 31:18.169
I'm obsessed.

31:18.689 --> 31:26.898
Do you feel, after all this, that you're closer to Lincoln, that you know him, that when you pick up one of his letters, is there some kind of communion with him?

31:26.918 --> 31:29.440
I mean, is that kind of stretching you a little bit, do you think?

31:30.681 --> 31:33.544
I think... Well, define the obsession, then.

31:34.030 --> 31:34.871
You say you're obsessed.

31:36.092 --> 31:37.414
Well, I enjoy it.

31:37.434 --> 31:38.836
I do it day and night.

31:39.536 --> 31:42.740
I wake up in the morning and work on it all day, gentlemen.

31:42.900 --> 31:43.321
Every day.

31:43.361 --> 31:44.282
Every day.

31:44.322 --> 31:47.486
And what is the obsession?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.268
To know Lincoln or to have Lincoln?

31:49.288 --> 31:51.951
Or to have the finest collection of Lincoln?

31:51.971 --> 31:54.374
I guess it became everything that you're saying.

31:54.394 --> 31:56.676
It just kind of evolved, didn't it?

31:57.818 --> 31:58.198
It just...

32:00.271 --> 32:00.752
I don't know.

32:00.832 --> 32:15.230
Once you get one thing, you start doing research, and then you start to get another, and when you've been somewhere, someone hears about you, and they offer you something, and then you start... It just starts, you know, going off, and it just takes off, and you can't control it.

32:15.911 --> 32:22.840
What do you hope that... Do you plan to make some provisions to keep the whole collection as a collection?

32:22.860 --> 32:28.928
Well, I never thought of that before, and then when I saved the Booth collection...

32:29.482 --> 32:37.672
God knows why, because, you know, I don't know many people that really would want a booth collection, yet it's a very important part of history.

32:37.692 --> 32:40.896
I don't know.

32:40.996 --> 32:42.138
I don't know what I'd do with it.

32:42.158 --> 32:43.740
So you really haven't given it that much thought.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.622
You're still enjoying... I'm enjoying it.

32:45.642 --> 32:47.504
You're enjoying the formation of it right now.

32:50.548 --> 32:53.872
Because it's almost like of Smithsonian quality, wouldn't you think?

32:54.813 --> 32:56.856
It would be a shame to see it broken up.

32:58.456 --> 33:00.559
But you haven't given that much thought at this point.

33:00.759 --> 33:02.221
No, no.

33:02.241 --> 33:05.025
And it would be like, well, where do you place it?

33:06.307 --> 33:16.281
Do you take... Like, for instance, that should go to Hilding, because that was in Hilding.

33:16.942 --> 33:18.324
No, what are we talking about?

33:18.344 --> 33:21.388
This sculpture here that Todd Lincoln owns.

33:22.470 --> 33:27.096
There are certain pieces that immediately off the top of my head I would say...

33:27.515 --> 33:30.177
should go broken up.

33:30.738 --> 33:32.400
Yeah, but the manuscripts and the letters.

33:32.420 --> 33:35.723
I don't know what I'll deal with them.

33:35.743 --> 33:37.664
Because that is an extraordinary collection.

33:38.005 --> 33:38.866
I mean, it is, I think.

33:39.446 --> 33:43.890
Do you see all this as one collection or do you see it as a number of collections?

33:43.910 --> 33:45.452
I see it as a number of collections.

33:45.512 --> 33:48.635
I see it as a Mary Lincoln collection.

33:48.655 --> 33:54.400
I see it as an Abraham Lincoln collection and then the Lincoln family collection.

33:54.835 --> 34:06.486
I see it as a John Wilkes Booth collection and I see it as a Booth family because I have the whole family and so much of it.

34:07.827 --> 34:11.130
That's how I got on the board of the Library of the Players Club.

34:11.730 --> 34:14.313
I feel that a lot of it probably should go there.

34:18.236 --> 34:19.578
That would be the place for that.

34:19.838 --> 34:24.522
But I think the answer is you're enjoying the collection so much now.

34:26.257 --> 34:27.399
You're not ready to think about it.

34:27.739 --> 34:28.320
I know.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.483
My husband, you know, he's in New York now.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.244
There's a sale.

34:32.446 --> 34:32.806
Big sale.

34:33.147 --> 34:33.447
Right.

34:34.188 --> 34:35.230
So I'll have to call you.

34:35.871 --> 34:38.554
If you call me tomorrow night, I'll tell you what I got.

34:39.956 --> 34:40.958
You'll get, well, you hope.

34:40.978 --> 34:44.342
You haven't lost anything yet.

34:44.362 --> 34:45.784
That's a very big sale.

34:45.824 --> 34:47.647
The Columbus letter, the declaration.

34:48.008 --> 34:51.492
So you sent your husband, or your husband went?

34:51.813 --> 34:52.654
Well, he went.

34:53.155 --> 34:54.617
We were both supposed to go.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.179
And I...

34:56.446 --> 35:01.073
The reason we were going was for me to do research at the players.

35:01.093 --> 35:04.598
I have a board meeting, and I was going to do the research for three days.

35:05.499 --> 35:09.505
And then when my brother became ill, there was no way, you know, that I could go.

35:09.565 --> 35:14.373
And my husband was just, as long as the sale was going on, he was going to watch it.

35:15.154 --> 35:17.998
Because we hire other people to bid for us.

35:19.040 --> 35:24.107
And then he decided that there were some major items I wanted.

35:24.610 --> 35:28.694
And he says, if we're going to spend that much money, he wanted to be there and he wanted to bid.

35:28.734 --> 35:30.056
So I said, go, go.

35:31.037 --> 35:31.697
I can't go.

35:31.777 --> 35:32.278
I'll be here.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.740
Ralph Newman will probably be there.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.442
You've gone against him, I'm sure, the fellow from Chicago.

35:36.683 --> 35:38.504
No, I don't go against him.

35:38.524 --> 35:39.566
He's bid for me.

35:39.586 --> 35:40.066
We're friends.

35:40.607 --> 35:43.710
We're friends.

35:44.130 --> 35:46.693
Things I've seen him buy, then he's probably bought for you.

35:48.735 --> 35:51.758
I'm told you used to go to the auctions, though, I guess, in New York.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.760
No, not that many.

35:53.780 --> 35:53.840
No.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.381
I haven't gotten them.

35:55.255 --> 35:56.977
I went to the Boothbay one.

35:56.997 --> 36:00.120
I went to that Chicago one.

36:00.761 --> 36:02.503
I went to the Doheny one just for that.

36:02.563 --> 36:04.766
And the rest of it, I've had people bid.

36:05.386 --> 36:05.967
Other people.

36:08.390 --> 36:10.212
I don't want to overstay our welcome.

36:10.873 --> 36:12.354
Can I just add one?

36:13.055 --> 36:17.400
In talking about Lisa's passion, I want to say a word for her.

36:18.361 --> 36:22.566
She has indefatigable... She's indefatigable.

36:23.246 --> 36:24.688
She will correspond with

36:25.073 --> 36:52.853
everybody any really the smallest person on the face of the earth who has an inquiry she will answer and give everything she knows she is totally generous all the time with everybody and is involved in all these societies helping people do this and that and just having the goodness of her heart because she's i think so in love with everything and people come to her with all kinds of questions from all these societies and it's

36:52.951 --> 36:58.677
Well, you know, you've got to do it because if they don't, our whole heritage is going to be gone.

36:59.398 --> 37:06.466
It really is because all the places that no one has any money, none of the libraries, no one can keep anything.

37:06.866 --> 37:11.131
So whenever I buy archival material, if they can't afford it, I'll say, well, tell me what you need.

37:11.191 --> 37:12.012
I'll send it to you.

37:12.512 --> 37:13.353
I'll give you money.

37:13.473 --> 37:14.174
I give them money.

37:14.414 --> 37:16.917
I support all of them because I really feel...

37:17.335 --> 37:20.900
whether they were traitors in history, it's a part of history.

37:21.781 --> 37:27.309
And we need to preserve this as a lesson to our country.

37:28.591 --> 37:30.894
Are you a Californian, native Californian?

37:30.995 --> 37:31.916
Born and raised.

37:33.378 --> 37:35.000
Were you always interested in history?

37:35.261 --> 37:38.586
Or again, does this begin when you read that novel?

37:39.166 --> 37:45.556
I was always curious and I always loved to go to historical places.

37:45.976 --> 37:47.258
I guess I always liked

37:48.200 --> 38:13.043
the times of the civil war and you know that time and earlier but yeah i do answer all these people and i really get the most i sit up late at 12 30 at night or sunday when everyone's quiet sleeping late i'm up at six and i come in here and quietly write to them and but it's nice because you know they really appreciate it

38:13.715 --> 38:15.438
Is your children still young?

38:15.999 --> 38:27.036
No, my son's in his second year of law school at Loyola, and my daughter's going to be, by the end of the summer, graduating from the Chicago Art Institute.

38:27.056 --> 38:27.918
Congratulations.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.382
And she made that Lincoln quilt.

38:30.402 --> 38:31.323
Did she make it?

38:31.343 --> 38:33.346
I looked at mine.

38:33.366 --> 38:33.607
She made it.

38:33.627 --> 38:36.471
Did they share your interest in the cashmere?

38:36.491 --> 38:38.655
They hated it for a while.

38:38.675 --> 38:41.359
And then now they like it because everything is

38:42.672 --> 39:10.924
they like it now because they've met great people and a lot of the springfield people come here and stay with us and and in springfield my whole life is different i live in this little apartment and do my own i don't cook that much we go out to eat a lot but clean it myself and and live real modestly just like everyone out there you know it's a poor little town and you can't you know wear rubby clothes and you know then when they came here they it was like oh my god you know i never talked about

39:11.444 --> 39:16.689
how I lived or anything, and now they, you know, all come when they get a vacation time.

39:16.709 --> 39:21.894
You talk about it, you think there's so much joy and pleasure, and you give so much pleasure to other people.

39:21.914 --> 39:31.563
Well, because the people that helped me, I feel I was fortunate, so maybe one of these obscure people that have written to me will become me.

39:32.124 --> 39:39.831
Because when I went to do research in Springfield for Wohlberg, I was the low man in the totem pole, and they said, little did they know

39:40.739 --> 39:45.586
18 years later, I was the one that could buy them all out and buy all the things that they had.

39:45.987 --> 39:48.651
So they said everyone ignored you when you were the little one.

39:48.891 --> 39:50.254
So it's a lesson in life.

39:50.274 --> 39:51.516
You don't ignore anyone.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.520
You can't.

39:56.363 --> 39:58.526
Have you cataloged the whole collection?

39:58.807 --> 40:00.810
We're working on that now.

40:01.591 --> 40:06.038
You might want to publish your catalog at some point.

40:07.099 --> 40:09.463
I buy at such a rapid pace.

40:09.865 --> 40:16.414
that I couldn't do that yet, because we just, you know, every, every, sometimes we're buying something every day.

40:16.454 --> 40:19.818
Every week, for sure, right?

40:21.120 --> 40:23.002
So this is, this is a growing collection.

40:23.904 --> 40:23.964
Oh.

40:23.984 --> 40:25.105
The end is not in sight?

40:25.305 --> 40:26.787
No, not at the end.

40:28.470 --> 40:29.171
Are you kidding?

40:29.191 --> 40:30.312
I got another, are you kidding?

40:30.332 --> 40:33.636
It just, again, another, what, 25 years.

40:33.656 --> 40:38.623
No, but I mean, in terms of, I suppose this kind of collection could never be complete, really.

40:39.987 --> 40:42.089
Well, you can't buy every book.

40:42.109 --> 40:43.251
You don't want every book.

40:43.371 --> 40:45.193
It's like, I don't know, 10,000 books.

40:45.273 --> 40:46.394
You know, you can't read them all.

40:46.454 --> 40:47.155
Who wants them all?

40:47.175 --> 40:49.257
But this is not a book collection fundamentally.

40:49.297 --> 40:50.438
It's a manuscript collection.

40:50.739 --> 40:51.199
Right.

40:51.219 --> 40:57.226
The strength, I mean, its mark will be made in the manuscript material, the unique material.

40:57.586 --> 40:58.307
And the artifacts.

40:58.327 --> 41:00.530
And the artifacts.

41:00.550 --> 41:00.810
Right.

41:01.010 --> 41:01.811
And photographs.

41:01.931 --> 41:04.734
I have other, oh, I've signed Lincoln photographs I didn't show you.

41:04.774 --> 41:05.615
Very rare.

41:06.276 --> 41:07.277
It's just so much.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.913
I noticed you mentioned Brady's photo box out there.

41:11.933 --> 41:13.135
Do you have Brady's stuff?

41:13.356 --> 41:20.068
No, that was just something when I was looking at a catalog and the dealer, not Ralph, another dealer was bidding for me.

41:20.088 --> 41:24.817
I just said, gee, if you could get that, I'd take that, too.

41:25.378 --> 41:31.088
You didn't bid for the, what was that, pen and ink thing last, at Christie's?

41:31.658 --> 41:33.080
The Penn case, it went for $130,000.

41:33.121 --> 41:36.506
No, it went for $77,000.

41:37.528 --> 41:42.376
Whatever it was, the estimate was... I went a little bit, didn't really want it.

41:42.557 --> 41:45.041
It was three, I was there, it was three telephone bidders.

41:45.301 --> 41:49.629
So nobody knew who... Mine was one, and another friend of mine was the other one.

41:50.791 --> 41:56.080
But it went, it went, you know, people started to chuckle at, who is this?

41:56.180 --> 41:57.362
Because it wasn't Lincoln's.

41:57.865 --> 41:59.447
The whole thing was crazy.

41:59.627 --> 42:00.648
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't listens.

42:00.688 --> 42:04.312
It was just a vague association type of a piece, I guess.

42:04.332 --> 42:09.678
But you get things like that with certain people that don't know what they're buying or what they're doing.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.584
Then you get dealers that'll bid you up.

42:14.984 --> 42:16.746
If you go to an auction, they get angry.

42:16.806 --> 42:19.249
Or people that get antagonized.

42:19.289 --> 42:20.891
That's why I stay away.

42:20.931 --> 42:24.034
So here we are on the eve of an important sale.

42:24.054 --> 42:24.775
Are you excited?

42:24.815 --> 42:26.617
Is there a sense of anticipation?

42:26.637 --> 42:27.518
Is there something really...

42:28.612 --> 42:37.280
No, because I've been under such pressure and everything with my brother that I called my husband just before you came.

42:37.300 --> 42:38.761
You know, because you got several calls.

42:38.861 --> 42:39.782
I almost canceled.

42:39.842 --> 42:40.443
I know that.

42:40.463 --> 42:41.344
I got the message.

42:41.364 --> 42:44.466
And I called my husband crying and I said, why are you at this stupid sale?

42:44.506 --> 42:45.027
Come home.

42:45.507 --> 42:47.649
You know, I just can't handle anything anymore.

42:47.709 --> 42:48.950
And I was like falling apart.

42:49.031 --> 42:58.399
And he said, you know, he said, in a couple of years from now, you'll yell at me that I came home and didn't get you what you wanted.

42:58.565 --> 43:28.032
and i love you i'm staying here and you're going to get what you want that's nice because what when it was our anniversary and mother's day and birthday coming up and everything i said don't give me anything i don't need anything wait until like there's a certain piece that i might really want and put it all together so we'll see he does share your enthusiasm for the oh he's every party goes everywhere with me he's known as the collector too

43:29.750 --> 43:33.635
I think, you know, we've... I'm sorry, Albert, I'm boring you.

43:33.655 --> 43:40.483
I've talked about this stuff forever, but you've given so generously of your time, and I know you have other thoughts.

43:42.545 --> 43:46.129
But I've seen it now, and now I can call and we can talk some more, too.

43:46.470 --> 43:46.930
Okay?

43:46.950 --> 43:50.434
Because I think it's going to take a little more, but we've seen.

43:51.075 --> 43:54.239
The knowledge, and you can't do it, and you can just read.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.922
There's a lot of people out there that are doing that.

43:57.762 --> 44:08.813
So then all of a sudden when you're able to buy something and you can do it, it's not only that you can buy it and you meet the right people and they really want it in a good collection.

44:09.393 --> 44:12.596
We're going to go home.

44:12.616 --> 44:14.779
It's taken well care of.

44:15.319 --> 44:19.103
You know, I came to meet to talk to Schwartz at Springfield.

44:19.383 --> 44:25.109
Did he tell you how this, well, I got this book, The Lincoln Collector by Sandberg.

44:26.010 --> 44:26.470
And I just,

44:26.804 --> 44:28.186
And, of course, you read this.

44:28.246 --> 44:31.970
This is a great collection, and he couldn't have done his biography without this.

44:33.151 --> 44:36.115
And I said, geez, I wonder where this collection went.

44:36.135 --> 44:37.917
If it was so great, it must be someplace.

44:38.558 --> 44:39.319
So I was calling.

44:39.339 --> 44:42.382
I called this fellow at the Newbury Library, who I interviewed last year.

44:42.442 --> 44:44.244
And he said, geez, good question.

44:44.264 --> 44:48.349
Carl Schwartz, down his wrinkle, he said, scattered to the four winds.

44:48.469 --> 44:49.631
He said, broken up.

44:49.651 --> 44:51.413
And he said, I guess it wasn't all that.

44:52.394 --> 44:53.235
I guess it was pretty good.

44:53.295 --> 44:55.798
But if it was so good, why didn't it stay together, you know?

44:56.403 --> 44:57.664
He put it up for sale.

44:59.646 --> 45:02.468
There were a lot of good collections that people just sold it.

45:02.528 --> 45:05.651
The Sang collection went up for sale and everything was divided up.

45:07.693 --> 45:09.194
Justin Turner needed money.

45:09.234 --> 45:10.295
He sold his.

45:10.315 --> 45:19.002
I am told that there's a lot of people that when they need money, that's the first thing, I guess, to go.

45:19.022 --> 45:19.963
I don't know.

45:20.023 --> 45:22.065
This stuff does not decrease in value.

45:22.385 --> 45:22.585
No.

45:22.745 --> 45:24.607
I mean, Lincoln is always going to be Lincoln.

45:24.767 --> 45:25.768
I mean, it's not like...

45:26.238 --> 45:29.421
Yeah, it's sad that Barrett did that.

45:30.983 --> 45:33.025
You know, he's buried near the Lincoln tomb.

45:34.407 --> 45:35.688
And he was obsessed.

45:36.809 --> 45:44.457
When I read the book, and you see what he did, and how he competed with people, and how he went about getting things, I felt, God, that's just like me.

45:44.477 --> 45:45.538
I'm doing that now.

45:45.899 --> 45:47.000
And it's harder as a woman.

45:47.781 --> 45:51.144
Well, you know, this is a question I should say, harder as a woman.

45:51.164 --> 45:54.928
I mean, you're aware, of course, that there really are not that many...

45:55.820 --> 45:57.321
women who are collectors.

45:57.542 --> 45:59.784
And I don't know why that is, but it's a fact.

45:59.804 --> 46:03.027
And so you really are one of the great collectors.

46:03.287 --> 46:05.169
Yeah, I've taken a lot of beating about it.

46:05.569 --> 46:05.929
Really?

46:06.150 --> 46:06.330
Yes.

46:07.291 --> 46:24.747
When people that were friends with my husband, after we were married maybe three years, and I had a lot of my Lincoln things up, and then things we acquired together, and they came in and they said to Barry, gee, I didn't know you collected Lincoln.

46:25.283 --> 46:28.408
It was like, oh, well, bimbo over there.

46:29.430 --> 46:30.812
I said, wait a minute.

46:30.832 --> 46:31.733
I'm the collector.

46:31.874 --> 46:33.196
Oh, gee, I didn't know.

46:33.536 --> 46:41.489
And a lot of his tennis friends, they always looked to me like I was just, you know, because he's older than me.

46:42.170 --> 46:50.363
And that just some empty-headed whatever until one day my husband missed a game.

46:50.815 --> 46:51.917
And they said, where were you?

46:51.957 --> 46:55.422
And he says, oh, we went to buy these John Wilkes Booth letters.

46:55.602 --> 46:58.186
Oh, you have to just hear this one thing and then I'll let you go.

46:58.266 --> 46:58.967
You'll love this.

46:59.468 --> 47:00.810
Beverly Hills Tennis Club.

47:00.850 --> 47:02.272
Misses the game.

47:02.853 --> 47:04.836
And the guy says, why weren't you here last week?

47:04.856 --> 47:07.319
And he says, well, my wife with these John Wilkes Booth.

47:07.339 --> 47:08.101
And they said, what?

47:08.121 --> 47:09.442
And he's telling them what I do.

47:09.463 --> 47:16.853
This guy shows up the following game and he shows my husband this little black box and opens it up.

47:17.274 --> 47:19.978
It's a Lincoln pardon written on a bandage.

47:21.528 --> 47:23.710
It is so rare I have it.

47:23.730 --> 47:29.015
Well, but Barry brings it home and I look and I said, well, so what?

47:29.416 --> 47:30.136
What does he want?

47:30.256 --> 47:31.117
Is he just showing it?

47:31.197 --> 47:32.559
It belongs to a client.

47:32.919 --> 47:34.601
The client had it for 20 years.

47:34.701 --> 47:36.042
It's been in this man as an attorney.

47:36.062 --> 47:37.563
It was in his vault for 20 years.

47:38.104 --> 47:41.007
I called the man up and I said, I have to have it.

47:41.487 --> 47:43.569
And he says, well, the woman's not going to sell it.

47:43.589 --> 47:44.750
It's been for 20 years.

47:45.111 --> 47:46.712
I said, let her name a price.

47:46.752 --> 47:47.793
He says, you don't understand.

47:47.813 --> 47:49.695
She's very, very wealthy.

47:49.861 --> 47:51.342
I said, well, then you tell her this.

47:51.763 --> 48:01.192
If money is no object, she should still name a price, and it's cruel of her to keep this from history because people should know he has never written a pardon on a bandage.

48:01.953 --> 48:05.757
And so he told her, and she sold it to me.

48:05.917 --> 48:07.899
So she did name a price?

48:07.919 --> 48:08.820
She named a price.

48:09.080 --> 48:09.721
I got it.

48:09.781 --> 48:13.705
I immediately took it to Springfield so they could photograph it and know about it.

48:14.205 --> 48:15.987
Did you authenticate it before you brought it?

48:16.709 --> 48:17.410
I knew it.

48:17.530 --> 48:20.214
I know Lincoln inside and out.

48:20.234 --> 48:21.776
People come to me, is this Lincoln?

48:22.537 --> 48:23.358
No question about it.

48:23.378 --> 48:26.382
Tom Schwartz looked at it, and oh, absolutely, they loved it.

48:26.542 --> 48:28.405
So they have it photographed for them.

48:28.425 --> 48:30.528
Have you researched it at all, how it came to life?

48:30.548 --> 48:32.150
Yes, this was another thing.

48:32.591 --> 48:34.293
He didn't mention the name of the boy.

48:34.834 --> 48:44.607
What we know is that he, Mary Lincoln, went to one of the hospitals at the time in Washington and would take flowers and flower seeds to the soldiers.

48:44.975 --> 48:47.018
And this is one time he went with them.

48:47.338 --> 48:51.565
And probably this boy was dying and he wanted to pardon him and just, there was no paper.

48:51.905 --> 48:53.207
And he would write on anything.

48:53.247 --> 48:55.831
So he picked up this piece of bandage and wrote on it.

48:56.512 --> 49:03.101
Let this boy be pardoned for any disloyalty or, I forget, and it's dated.

49:03.702 --> 49:10.352
So then I started to research and I called, there's a number you can call for military civil war research.

49:10.412 --> 49:12.595
And this girl says, well, who's it to?

49:13.136 --> 49:14.458
And I said, there isn't a name.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.409
So she said, listen, lady.

49:16.889 --> 49:21.333
And she says, I don't care if it's written on a sock.

49:22.094 --> 49:25.257
If it doesn't have his name, we can't help you.

49:25.277 --> 49:26.458
I was so angry.

49:26.478 --> 49:27.639
I said, well, you listen.

49:28.140 --> 49:32.904
If it was written on a sock, it'd be more valuable than the band did when I hung up on her.

49:34.506 --> 49:35.707
But I get this all the time.

49:36.328 --> 49:38.670
You know, you're a woman and you don't know anything.

49:38.730 --> 49:41.813
And I had trouble getting in the players club.

49:42.367 --> 49:44.049
to do research.

49:44.230 --> 49:45.291
The curator.

49:45.391 --> 49:46.433
We're best friends now.

49:46.573 --> 49:47.495
I'm on the board now.

49:47.535 --> 49:48.676
He wouldn't let me in.

49:49.217 --> 49:52.542
And when he met me, I said, give me five minutes.

49:52.923 --> 49:56.548
I used every pull I could think of in New York and couldn't get in.

49:57.349 --> 50:00.274
And finally, I phoned him up and I said, I'm demanding.

50:00.334 --> 50:02.256
I'm going to stand on your doorstep.

50:02.276 --> 50:04.119
Please look at me and talk to me.

50:04.139 --> 50:05.561
Give me four minutes of your time.

50:06.282 --> 50:07.384
So he said, oh, all right.

50:07.725 --> 50:09.387
Gave me the time and...

50:09.552 --> 50:10.153
That was it.

50:10.193 --> 50:10.934
We became good friends.

50:10.954 --> 50:11.494
Why wouldn't they?

50:11.595 --> 50:13.697
I mean, you believe it's because you're a woman?

50:13.777 --> 50:16.220
Also, there's Boothies.

50:16.240 --> 50:19.544
There's these Boothies that are very... Boothies.

50:19.564 --> 50:24.651
They're called Boothies, and they love John Wilkes Booth, and they idolize him, and they're obsessed.

50:24.831 --> 50:26.053
John Wilkes Booth?

50:26.093 --> 50:28.616
You mean there are people who idolize John Wilkes Booth?

50:28.656 --> 50:29.477
Idolize as a cult.

50:29.998 --> 50:30.258
Why?

50:30.318 --> 50:33.462
They just... They're Confederates.

50:33.622 --> 50:34.864
The war's still on.

50:35.244 --> 50:36.606
You know what I'm called in the South?

50:36.646 --> 50:37.887
The Booth Lady.

50:37.907 --> 50:38.428
Don't you?

50:38.628 --> 50:40.150
In the north, I'm the Lincoln lady.

50:40.210 --> 50:41.631
In the south, I'm the Booth lady.

50:42.071 --> 50:43.333
Because you collect both.

50:43.353 --> 50:43.973
That's right.

50:44.474 --> 50:45.295
I'm a Gemini.

50:46.536 --> 50:47.277
I'm a Gemini.

50:47.457 --> 50:47.777
Are you?

50:48.058 --> 50:48.838
When's your birthday?

50:48.858 --> 50:50.420
May 25th.

50:51.181 --> 50:51.821
June 20th.

50:54.104 --> 50:54.684
That's close.

50:55.165 --> 50:56.906
Next week.

50:56.926 --> 50:57.587
Happy birthday.

50:57.968 --> 50:59.509
Thank you.

50:59.529 --> 51:00.510
So, you know.

51:01.831 --> 51:04.754
But the war is still going on with these people when you go there.

51:05.895 --> 51:08.398
I've heard it's the undertones, but nothing...

51:09.458 --> 51:11.722
Yes, absolutely.

51:11.842 --> 51:16.649
When you talk to them, they don't want to hear a thing about Lincoln in the South, famously, particularly.

51:16.689 --> 51:18.372
They're very racist.

51:18.412 --> 51:20.155
Plus, you know, this Booth was a hero.

51:20.595 --> 51:22.979
And you want to hear the craziest thing?

51:23.240 --> 51:25.223
They are so anti-Semitic.

51:25.423 --> 51:28.648
And I have found that John Wilkes Booth,

51:29.303 --> 51:30.885
is part Jewish.

51:30.945 --> 51:34.549
And they are in my research and it's just, oh, no, no, no, it can't be.

51:34.809 --> 51:35.970
And it absolutely, isn't it?

51:36.010 --> 51:37.873
We've gone over and over.

51:37.953 --> 51:39.294
And they don't want to hear it.

51:39.354 --> 51:41.837
They just, I said, well, you know, it's history.

51:41.877 --> 51:42.538
Who cares?

51:43.198 --> 51:44.400
And you've researched it.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.401
Absolutely.

51:46.242 --> 51:49.606
So Edwin Lufus was, obviously, his brother was part Jewish as well.

51:50.006 --> 51:51.508
It's like way back.

51:53.410 --> 51:58.956
But some of the stories were that when the father was buried,

51:59.206 --> 52:04.117
The tombstone was in Hebrew, and then they replaced it and got rid of it.

52:04.438 --> 52:05.581
Junius, right?

52:05.601 --> 52:06.042
Right.

52:06.964 --> 52:09.710
So there's a lot of, it's just, it's fascinating.

52:09.750 --> 52:10.532
Really, it is.

52:10.552 --> 52:13.138
I think we could be here all day after day.

52:13.459 --> 52:15.744
No, you're not actually keeping us.

52:16.385 --> 52:18.009
You're not one, do you?

52:18.189 --> 52:18.430
Oh, yeah.
