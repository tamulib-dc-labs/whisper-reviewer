WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:03.835
Great.

00:04.255 --> 00:06.779
Oh, could we have a little butter?

00:07.079 --> 00:08.662
A little butter, please?

00:08.682 --> 00:19.898
It's interesting, isn't it, that where there has been an autobiography, and also almost a classic biography, that a new biography is necessary.

00:19.978 --> 00:27.709
Now, I know some of the technical reasons for the release of the, you know, in 1990, a lot of the papers and stuff, but...

00:28.145 --> 00:32.672
I'm sure you also agree that every generation needs a new life.

00:32.692 --> 00:46.312
Well, especially in this case, because what happened with E. Curie's book was that it was really so popular and such a big book in so many people's minds that it really preempted the field.

00:46.353 --> 00:47.074
Don't mind.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.077
I'm just going to periodically check this.

00:49.137 --> 00:49.798
Is it working?

00:49.818 --> 00:50.439
Yeah, it's fine.

00:50.459 --> 00:50.659
It's fine.

00:50.639 --> 00:58.236
And it had been, I mean, it took, there were a lot of reasons, you're right, a lot of sort of intellectual reasons to do it again.

00:58.497 --> 01:05.533
A lot has happened, the women's movements happened, World War II and the atom bomb have happened since 1937, which would be the date of E.S.

01:05.553 --> 01:07.517
Curious, but...

01:07.750 --> 01:19.025
But the reason that, you know, I thought a lot about that work, of course, and why I decided I wanted to do this.

01:19.205 --> 01:21.989
Madame Curie had been a really important book to me growing up.

01:22.149 --> 01:27.076
And in fact, when I graduated from high school, I quoted from it in my high school valedictory speeches.

01:27.737 --> 01:36.188
And it turns out it's a very important book for a lot of people, especially women, especially women in sciences.

01:36.168 --> 01:45.376
But when I went back to it, about eight years ago, I looked at it, I realized that it's a very idealized and a triumphal version of her life.

01:45.436 --> 01:52.822
You see the cruelty of Satan, but you don't see her difficulties, but the context, you know, the world around her.

01:53.603 --> 01:54.403
Very selective.

01:54.804 --> 02:01.069
And in fact, the first thing I did was, when I decided to do this, was go and talk to Eve, Curie Laboree.

02:01.109 --> 02:02.230
I was amazed that you were able to.

02:02.270 --> 02:02.670
Yeah.

02:02.851 --> 02:04.532
I didn't really expect you to do that.

02:04.552 --> 02:05.433
Well, she's 90.

02:05.653 --> 02:05.753
Yeah.

02:06.037 --> 02:07.422
Maybe 91 by now.

02:07.643 --> 02:08.305
She's still alive.

02:08.426 --> 02:15.270
And she's alive and well, very well, and lives quite well in Manhattan.

02:15.453 --> 02:27.689
It's funny, because I didn't know where she was, and my husband is a New Yorker, and he's a New Yorker, old file, and I said to him, you know, Danny, where am I going to find this woman?

02:27.709 --> 02:30.833
And he said, look in the Manhattan directly, she'll be here.

02:32.074 --> 02:33.616
And she was.

02:33.856 --> 02:45.291
And so I went to see her, and from our conversation, I gleaned, it became more clear to me than I had before that she had a hidden agenda in writing that book.

02:45.541 --> 02:51.948
And it was very clearly, she said to me, I wrote it because I wasn't afraid of what I'm going to do.

02:52.449 --> 02:58.796
So, you know, I feel her book was the inspiration kind of for a lot of people.

02:58.856 --> 03:11.611
And my book, I hope, can be both inspiration and also information context about what it is like to be a woman who's that far ahead of, that kind of really pioneering woman.

03:11.631 --> 03:13.793
I mean, one of the so very few.

03:14.026 --> 03:17.915
And it turns out that she had a lot of problems.

03:17.935 --> 03:26.174
And they don't really get dealt with in these books at all.

03:26.254 --> 03:26.475
No.

03:26.515 --> 03:33.030
No, not at all.

03:33.010 --> 03:36.955
Well, they're momentous.

03:37.196 --> 03:38.197
Yeah, they really are.

03:38.357 --> 03:42.122
And what's amazing is that there hasn't been more biographies, actually.

03:42.202 --> 03:43.604
Look at something like Einstein.

03:43.644 --> 03:46.749
I mean, how many, I don't know how many biographies there are.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.471
It's funny you should bring that up.

03:48.631 --> 03:52.436
I was just saying the other day, I haven't seen an Einstein.

03:52.456 --> 03:52.817
A new Einstein.

03:52.837 --> 03:53.217
A good Einstein.

03:53.237 --> 03:53.938
Yeah, a new one.

03:54.399 --> 03:58.304
Yeah, there's no correspondence being published very recently, I know.

03:59.266 --> 04:00.267
Yeah.

04:00.331 --> 04:05.679
But it seems to me over the years there's been maybe hundreds, you know.

04:05.719 --> 04:09.304
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

04:09.665 --> 04:12.849
So, you know, you think so, yeah.

04:12.869 --> 04:24.887
But I think what people have felt, and it was said to me a lot, there's this feeling, because that book was, there was a book and then there was a movie, and for a lot of people it's kind of etched, you know, in,

04:25.711 --> 04:31.661
forever in memory, and that's who she was, and it's iconic in a way.

04:33.544 --> 04:36.389
Yeah, it's a rock.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.256
Yeah.

04:40.356 --> 04:41.398
Right, right.

04:41.418 --> 04:48.951
It was those biopics, you know, and she was, for a lot of people, she was...

04:49.505 --> 04:54.050
when it's done right on me, Walter Pigeon and Drew Garci in that movie.

04:54.130 --> 04:56.613
In fact, I did a thing at the Coolidge Corner.

04:56.633 --> 04:57.634
It was really fun.

04:57.654 --> 05:01.758
We showed that 1943 movie, and then I talked about my book and did a signing.

05:01.778 --> 05:02.819
It was really interesting.

05:03.140 --> 05:17.115
What's been interesting to me about this is that I get kind of... There's been an attitude towards Marie Curie, among feminists particularly, that she's kind of not one of us.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.728
And she was so famous and she was so successful.

05:20.889 --> 05:28.337
And, you know, there's somebody named Margaret Rossiter, who's a historian of science, and she wrote a book about women in science in this period.

05:28.397 --> 05:42.172
And she claims that Marie Curie's visit to America actually set women scientists back because she was so famous and so idealized that other women were told, well, you know, you can't be Madame Curie, so therefore, you know, forget it.

05:42.192 --> 05:44.995
I mean, she calls this the Madame Curie strategy.

05:45.295 --> 05:46.056
You're kidding me.

05:46.306 --> 05:51.893
No, and she brings up a threshold, a raise of threshold.

05:51.953 --> 05:54.757
Well, it's such a cockeyed argument.

05:54.837 --> 05:56.098
I mean, it's crazy.

05:56.459 --> 06:00.003
But see, I think it all comes out of this triumphal version of her life.

06:00.524 --> 06:04.569
Because she's been presented as this person who kind of was imperfect.

06:04.629 --> 06:07.252
You know, it wasn't like us other women, you know.

06:07.272 --> 06:13.680
She didn't have to face the kinds of prejudices and her rejection and all that stuff that other women have faced.

06:14.099 --> 06:17.485
And it's a real distortion.

06:17.565 --> 06:30.126
When you see this, you know, terribly hurt and humiliated by this whole , which is a very important piece of sexist politics, you know, and it's important to know about it.

06:30.607 --> 06:34.374
I'm amazed that somebody suggested she does, except when she's a Nobel Prize.

06:34.434 --> 06:38.200
Isn't that incredible?

06:38.551 --> 06:40.835
That's right.

06:41.596 --> 06:45.282
I mean, for me, that was all new to me.

06:45.903 --> 06:59.066
And for me, it's one of the most triumphant, really courageous moments in the book, that letter that she writes to the Nobel Committee saying, you know, my science is one thing, my private life is another thing, and I'm coming.

06:59.126 --> 07:00.428
And then she goes.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.331
I mean, it took a lot of courage.

07:02.429 --> 07:12.885
That's right, and not just be done in them.

07:13.085 --> 07:26.465
There's a fascinating book which I really enjoyed and made use of called The Trial of Madame Cayot by Edward Berenson.

07:26.665 --> 07:29.770
He's at the University of California.

07:30.627 --> 07:36.935
And it's about another woman who shot the, she shot the editor of The Figaro.

07:36.955 --> 07:42.822
And it was a, yeah, well, it's a great story.

07:42.862 --> 07:52.254
Because he wrote, he published something shocking about her husband, who was in that cabinet affair with another woman.

07:52.875 --> 07:58.542
And she was, and actually she was, well, it was a huge scandal, and she was essentially,

07:58.758 --> 08:03.427
She was acquitted in the end of the murder because it was done in passion, and that was the thing.

08:03.989 --> 08:10.141
But anyway, these kind of things were not my common in that period in France.

08:10.602 --> 08:13.628
So tell me how you started, Jan.

08:13.648 --> 08:18.117
Again, the book tells me everything I have to know about you.

08:18.468 --> 08:19.449
Right.

08:21.791 --> 08:25.514
Well, you know, I had a couple of special reasons for doing this.

08:25.674 --> 08:27.096
One was that the papers were opening up.

08:27.116 --> 08:30.259
The other was that my sister was married to the U.S.

08:30.339 --> 08:35.543
Ambassador to Poland, and they were living in Warsaw during this period, and they were both Polish freshmen.

08:36.584 --> 08:39.907
So one of the first things I did was to go to Poland.

08:40.007 --> 08:46.213
I spent a month there and traveled around to the praises where she'd worked as a governor for two

08:46.447 --> 08:51.006
the kind of home villages of her family, the squabbies and the...

08:51.357 --> 09:00.970
where the family had come from, and also talked with a grand-nephew and found family papers that hadn't been translated.

09:01.051 --> 09:03.234
That was really important.

09:03.354 --> 09:07.860
I don't speak Polish, so I had to get translated, which is a job and an expense.

09:08.020 --> 09:17.854
Well, I just, you know, a fair amount of revising, and then I had

09:18.070 --> 09:28.390
The poetry was very... I thought it was real important to do the poetry right, to try to get someone to... So I had a couple of poet friends who... What do you call that?

09:28.410 --> 09:29.773
I think you call it diversifying.

09:29.933 --> 09:33.480
And we had fun with that.

09:36.266 --> 09:37.328
But I felt very...

09:38.050 --> 09:43.920
connected to the Polish part because I had this family who were so involved in Poland.

09:44.320 --> 09:44.801
And it helped.

09:44.821 --> 09:53.055
Because it's not that, you know, Polish culture and history, and my brother-in-law's a Polish historian, it's a kind of an arcane and

09:53.187 --> 09:58.093
not that easy to understand things.

09:58.113 --> 10:01.818
So that was important for me.

10:01.838 --> 10:04.681
Did you start this after the previous biography?

10:05.002 --> 10:05.823
Yeah, yeah.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.026
It was not too long after.

10:08.046 --> 10:10.989
So it's really been that long.

10:12.371 --> 10:15.235
I know, I say seven years, and people say, seven years?

10:15.555 --> 10:17.878
And then they think, well, and they say,

10:18.044 --> 10:37.808
Did you have another job?

10:37.788 --> 10:48.714
A father not having a book.

10:49.075 --> 10:51.220
Will she believe it when it comes out?

10:51.841 --> 10:54.227
Yeah.

10:54.207 --> 11:01.454
Anyway, let's go back.

11:02.515 --> 11:23.995
The Atlantic is nice to work with.

11:24.228 --> 11:27.012
Who do you recommend contacting him?

11:28.154 --> 11:29.196
Well, Bill Whitworth.

11:29.236 --> 11:30.177
Not at all.

11:30.197 --> 11:31.139
He's the editor-in-chief.

11:31.159 --> 11:33.082
He's a very nice guy, very quiet.

11:34.083 --> 11:39.632
And you could lay it out for him, and he would say yes or no, probably right then.

11:39.892 --> 11:43.518
He's amazingly quick about it and very clear, and he runs it.

11:43.638 --> 11:47.764
He's a czar, you know, and he runs it that way.

11:47.804 --> 11:50.028
Oh, yeah, they do.

11:50.048 --> 11:50.168
Yeah.

11:50.384 --> 12:11.076
I wrote this essay for the time about the process of writing the biography.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.603
It wasn't.

12:14.044 --> 12:15.707
I went through one of those things with them.

12:15.767 --> 12:16.248
They loved it.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.590
They were going to publish it.

12:17.610 --> 12:18.411
They were going to publish it.

12:18.431 --> 12:21.015
No, it was going to be an essay in the Times Book Review.

12:21.516 --> 12:22.698
Yeah, TDR.

12:22.998 --> 12:23.879
For Becky?

12:23.899 --> 12:24.480
Yeah, Becky.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.201
Becky bought it.

12:26.083 --> 12:31.050
And then they were supposed to run it before my pub date.

12:31.411 --> 12:37.000
And as the pub date got closer and closer and I didn't hear, you know, I got more and more worried.

12:37.020 --> 12:37.480
My agent called.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.582
They changed their mind.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.964
But they're not doing essays anymore.

12:39.984 --> 12:40.245
Right.

12:40.265 --> 12:41.546
They've changed the whole format.

12:41.646 --> 12:49.416
Anyway, that was one of those, you know, produced and abandoned stories with all of us writers.

12:49.496 --> 12:52.139
This is going to make the book.

12:52.159 --> 12:53.340
This will absolutely make the book.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.822
I was so thrilled.

12:54.842 --> 12:55.944
I took everybody out to dinner.

12:57.065 --> 12:59.668
They at least paid me for a book.

13:00.789 --> 13:01.330
Yeah.

13:01.681 --> 13:06.086
But it was, you know, I mean, the money was not the issue, believe me.

13:06.406 --> 13:10.490
You know, it was just such a high.

13:10.510 --> 13:20.761
And then, you know, of course, I don't know if you saw the Times review last week, but Phil Morrison did it.

13:20.841 --> 13:25.926
It's a very favorable review, because it's lucid and timely and usually written stuff.

13:26.026 --> 13:30.591
It's kind of like a sign, you know, that they're not ravers, you know, so it's very even.

13:30.807 --> 13:31.348
I know.

13:31.368 --> 13:33.772
New and noteworthy.

13:33.852 --> 13:36.717
That's what I said.

13:36.938 --> 13:44.911
Because somebody said to me, well, you know, it wasn't on the cover.

13:44.971 --> 13:47.736
I said, look, you know, I could have been a new and noteworthy.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.982
It happens to really good books.

13:50.603 --> 13:52.865
Really good books.

13:53.206 --> 14:01.635
So now, this time around, to my surprise, I'm being reviewed by Scientist, which am getting very positive reviews from them.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.239
Some were full than others.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.422
There's one in Science magazine, I heard Science.

14:07.462 --> 14:08.543
Do you see Science at all?

14:08.563 --> 14:10.265
But anyway, it's a wonderful review.

14:10.605 --> 14:11.647
It's really one of the best.

14:11.707 --> 14:12.507
Yeah.

14:13.829 --> 14:16.332
Well, Science was mine, too.

14:16.632 --> 14:17.453
I had real...

14:17.888 --> 14:20.272
about taking this on because of the science.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.493
That's a question.

14:21.514 --> 14:22.295
Yes.

14:22.996 --> 14:29.466
Because you do, as a class in one respect, that you do kind of explain the material and lay the material.

14:29.486 --> 14:29.666
Right.

14:31.248 --> 14:33.612
Well, it's a... In accessible terms.

14:33.992 --> 14:35.455
Right.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.336
It's really important

14:36.772 --> 15:05.513
you don't want to lose that reader absolutely i mean one thing that i know i never will it's not the way it is well you know a couple things that were helpful one was that justin kaplan told me early on um that as a non-expert you have an advantage because other experts are afraid of being experts are afraid of being caught out by other experts as a non-expert

15:05.830 --> 15:06.831
Yeah.

15:08.253 --> 15:11.098
Yeah, in your book, I'm sure.

15:11.758 --> 15:13.701
But as a non-expert, you can afford to be obvious.

15:14.502 --> 15:15.944
And experts can't.

15:15.964 --> 15:21.673
And you can afford to take that reader, who's also a non-expert, carry him along with you.

15:22.354 --> 15:27.000
So, you know, that was very... I thought he was really right about that.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.202
And I could have kept that in mind.

15:28.502 --> 15:30.906
I also took a college-level chemistry course.

15:30.966 --> 15:33.930
I don't believe you can ever explain so much of a question about it.

15:33.910 --> 15:35.613
Oh, I agree.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.477
I absolutely agree.

15:37.497 --> 15:43.670
And that's one of, of course, you know, if you've ever taught writing, that's one of the great problems.

15:43.730 --> 15:44.812
Right, right.

15:45.253 --> 15:48.038
Yeah, yeah.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.106
I took, I took, now this will show you how brave I am.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.872
I took the college-level chemistry at Pine Manor.

15:54.852 --> 15:58.343
And I took a history of science course at Harvard.

15:59.266 --> 16:08.035
Also very important, because a lot of this science is old, you know, and if you talk to, what I discovered is if you talk to a current contemporary chemist,

16:08.470 --> 16:14.917
about what the quartz pizzo-electrique was and how they were doing their measurements, he has no idea.

16:14.957 --> 16:16.899
He doesn't understand either.

16:16.919 --> 16:24.808
Historians of science have a different kind of knowledge that's really important to understanding this turn-of-the-century science, because so much has happened.

16:24.908 --> 16:28.192
These contemporary scientists, I mean, so much has happened.

16:28.212 --> 16:31.896
They don't understand this primitive stuff so well, you know.

16:32.163 --> 16:40.535
I did go back to school, and I went back to some more friends.

16:40.615 --> 16:41.276
Not at all.

16:41.777 --> 16:42.157
Not at all.

16:42.177 --> 16:47.465
I mean, it's what I like about doing biography, you know.

16:47.485 --> 16:50.830
It's an informal way of doing graduate work, you know.

16:50.850 --> 16:52.332
My son says, you know,

16:52.312 --> 16:53.896
Each book is a Ph.D.

16:53.936 --> 17:02.978
in a way, that's true.

17:05.946 --> 17:09.274
What a nice job you have.

17:09.254 --> 17:22.825
Without, you know.

17:23.125 --> 17:27.791
You probably can't quote me, but without a lot of the bullshit, you know.

17:28.191 --> 17:38.044
But really, you know, I talk to my friends who have PhDs and who teach... Yeah, yeah, it's wonderful, you know.

17:38.184 --> 17:44.212
I read the book, I talk to the author, and then I have to go back and write about it.

17:44.452 --> 17:48.137
And you don't have to deal with the politics of academia and all that stuff.

17:48.472 --> 17:50.574
You know, because I have a lot of friends.

17:50.775 --> 17:54.659
I'm in a biographies group with four other women with four-time biographies.

17:54.679 --> 17:54.959
Yeah.

17:54.979 --> 17:56.221
And five other women.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.923
Is there a new biographies group?

17:57.943 --> 18:05.291
Well, that group has been running for... Well, I was in a writer's group that went on for many, many years.

18:05.892 --> 18:08.936
Yeah, Paula did some reviewing for you, I know.

18:08.996 --> 18:10.457
Yeah, yeah.

18:10.838 --> 18:14.041
And she was in that group with me as an old friend.

18:14.522 --> 18:18.006
The biographies group has been going on for maybe four or five years.

18:18.138 --> 18:41.749
But it's a very interesting contrast between the full-time biographers who are professional writers and the people in academia who are in a state of constant frustration because so much of what they do is not really important or central to their lives and they want to be working on their biographies, you know, and they have to keep...

18:42.404 --> 18:46.010
It's like Poetus Interruptors all the time, you know, you got to go back and do the class.

18:46.631 --> 18:48.353
Nice imagery.

18:48.373 --> 18:53.602
I thought you started this in about 87, 88, right?

18:54.804 --> 18:56.707
Yeah, yeah, I lived in 88.

18:57.007 --> 18:59.691
And so did you go with the opening of those papers before?

18:59.711 --> 19:00.072
I did.

19:00.092 --> 19:03.197
It was one of the reasons I decided was the opening of the papers.

19:03.329 --> 19:11.144
And the fact that my brother-in-law, yeah, me too, my brother-in-law was ambassador to Poland.

19:11.605 --> 19:19.380
So the two things that came to me, plus my early love of this other book, you know, something was telling me this was my book.

19:19.495 --> 19:22.782
Going back forever, almost.

19:22.802 --> 19:24.867
Yeah, really, really, back to high school.

19:24.887 --> 19:28.335
And I was quite fluent in French.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.760
You did a quote from this from your NFL of your period yesterday?

19:30.860 --> 19:32.063
I did, I did, yeah.

19:32.524 --> 19:35.631
Chillicothe High School in Chillicothe, Ohio.

19:35.611 --> 19:39.437
That's C-H-I-L-L-I-C-O-T-H-A.

19:39.457 --> 19:40.920
Is that near Toledo or Columbus?

19:41.040 --> 19:42.783
It's 50 miles south of Columbus.

19:43.203 --> 19:44.826
I'm in Columbus and Toledo.

19:44.986 --> 19:48.111
Toledo takes me a year.

19:48.131 --> 19:48.652
Oh, really?

19:48.672 --> 19:50.896
No, we never finished talking about my newspaper.

19:50.916 --> 19:51.437
Yeah.

19:51.737 --> 19:54.562
Well, Sandy told me you're on 68th.

19:54.582 --> 19:56.144
Oh, my gosh.

19:56.164 --> 19:56.945
I'm 16th.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.069
She said 68th.

19:59.109 --> 19:59.830
Oh, well.

20:00.097 --> 20:00.918
She's a publisher.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.607
No, no, you must have misguided.

20:05.687 --> 20:07.570
No, no, she's printed on my little thing.

20:07.650 --> 20:08.552
I don't have a weapon.

20:08.572 --> 20:09.834
Yeah, that's a mistake.

20:09.854 --> 20:10.275
Okay, 16.

20:10.295 --> 20:11.397
Well, 16's pretty good.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.018
Oh, I wish.

20:12.699 --> 20:14.442
Damn it, my papers are collapsed.

20:14.462 --> 20:18.149
I mean, of what I've done here, I still have to get more.

20:18.169 --> 20:18.409
So.

20:19.942 --> 20:27.578
Well, I was talking about going back to school, and the reasons for doing it.

20:27.899 --> 20:40.566
Of course, then what happened was, yeah, what happened then was that the things that opened in January, I was there January 3rd, 1990, 9 o'clock in the morning.

20:40.546 --> 20:47.196
Yeah, I know.

20:47.396 --> 20:48.418
That's the French style.

20:48.538 --> 20:52.343
It's very hard to get used to.

20:53.405 --> 20:57.831
And those turned out to be amazing and wonderful.

20:59.935 --> 21:03.520
Well, what was really important was that there were two journals there.

21:03.660 --> 21:09.068
One was a journal she kept for the whole year after Pierre died, and it was very emotional and very touching.

21:09.335 --> 21:13.722
And it kind of recapitulated their life together in the last days before his death.

21:13.782 --> 21:20.312
So it had that kind of sense of a domestic life together with children, which I hadn't gotten anywhere else.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.856
Now, you were there when it opened.

21:22.876 --> 21:25.480
Were you able to get there this pencil?

21:25.540 --> 21:28.104
Well, no, I'm still in French, and it was all in French.

21:28.124 --> 21:33.092
At that point, she didn't use her Polish much anymore.

21:33.453 --> 21:36.878
So there was that, and there was a wonderful record, very...

21:37.060 --> 21:50.756
The Internet is revealing, in a certain way, a very careful record of her children's progress, both physical growth and height, weight, all that stuff, but also notes about their progress.

21:50.796 --> 21:52.258
So you've got to see her as a mother.

21:52.579 --> 21:57.725
And that, to me, was very revealing, almost more than anything.

21:57.925 --> 21:58.686
Very touching.

21:59.006 --> 22:01.790
You know, the problem was that she was remote.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.274
It's hard to attend the inner emotion.

22:05.314 --> 22:06.375
I knew it wasn't there.

22:06.693 --> 22:10.493
that she, because partly of these public humiliations,

22:10.760 --> 22:13.304
she developed a kind of a persona.

22:13.744 --> 22:19.392
I love those two little anecdotes you have at the Westlands.

22:20.073 --> 22:25.661
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it makes a fuss, right.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.626
Yeah, yeah, I love you too.

22:28.646 --> 22:32.411
Those actually, that's the kind of, you know, those little quirky things.

22:33.413 --> 22:37.138
Those were only available in Polish, because Polish

22:37.574 --> 22:38.095
No kidding.

22:38.115 --> 22:45.064
A newspaper person had interviewed that chauffeur towards the end of her life, or after she died, actually.

22:45.084 --> 22:52.775
And so they were in a Polish newspaper, and when I did a search of the Polish library, there it was.

22:53.616 --> 22:55.899
So there's no reason for that.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.824
Absolutely not.

22:58.864 --> 23:00.025
No, that's right.

23:00.065 --> 23:02.729
And you've got to go there.

23:03.069 --> 23:06.094
You've got to go there physically.

23:06.454 --> 23:06.735
Right.

23:06.955 --> 23:07.075
Right.

23:07.055 --> 23:18.391
And by the way, I'm the only biographer, I believe, I think there have been, you can say there have been five biographies, including a French one that's translated, and I'm the only one that's gone to Poland.

23:19.993 --> 23:21.556
And that's a huge difference.

23:21.576 --> 23:23.038
You know, you've got to go to Poland.

23:23.799 --> 23:25.681
The cookie is, you know.

23:25.782 --> 23:27.724
Absolutely.

23:28.025 --> 23:30.328
Every single thread.

23:30.612 --> 23:37.281
I mean, you wouldn't suggest that this was a very indigenous man, didn't you?

23:37.565 --> 23:41.952
Well, I think hers was a revision of the biography.

23:41.972 --> 23:43.795
You know what I mean.

23:43.855 --> 23:53.049
I mean, it was a biography which revised the record in order to protect her mother.

23:53.069 --> 23:58.798
And it's a very understandable impact on the part of a daughter, and very admirable even, I think, you know.

23:59.038 --> 24:03.505
But that was 1937, and this is 1995, and now...

24:03.805 --> 24:09.252
That, you have heard, doesn't seem relevant anymore, because too much is left out.

24:09.272 --> 24:19.024
I remember when Justin Chaplin was sitting around, considering there was a book like... Oh, Charlie Chaplin?

24:19.044 --> 24:21.567
That was one, and then was Grant he was thinking about?

24:21.587 --> 24:21.887
Grant.

24:22.408 --> 24:23.910
Oh, right.

24:24.050 --> 24:27.334
And that, of course, does the poetry from McFeely's book.

24:27.374 --> 24:29.256
Yeah, the Grant book.

24:29.472 --> 24:40.451
But he said, one of the reasons why it's so pertinent to what you're saying, one of the reasons he's got a new grant that was, he had a great grant, a wonderful number.

24:40.611 --> 24:47.262
But he said, you know, you read these people not so much for what they say, but also for what they don't say.

24:47.242 --> 24:52.692
Absolutely, that's true.

24:52.792 --> 25:06.297
And then your job is to find out.

25:06.277 --> 25:16.256
You just mentioned once, the lessons, the study, I mean, the people in the Panama... You're right, the whole scandal thing.

25:16.677 --> 25:20.825
No, yeah, not just the scandal, but the people who were building the... Oh, yeah.

25:20.845 --> 25:22.789
Basically, it's called a credit for it.

25:22.869 --> 25:23.551
Yeah, yeah.

25:23.691 --> 25:24.252
Maybe this is... Yeah.

25:24.569 --> 25:35.765
It's very revealing in her case, and it's exactly in character.

25:35.785 --> 25:40.192
You know, what her daughter says is I'm sure what she said.

25:40.212 --> 25:42.695
That's the thing about being rejected from the Academy.

25:42.755 --> 25:46.020
What E. Teary says, you know, it didn't bother her one whit.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.263
Other people in her laboratory were bothered.

25:48.384 --> 25:49.445
She was not bothered.

25:49.465 --> 25:50.547
Well, I don't believe that.

25:51.168 --> 25:54.733
You know, nobody, nobody.

25:54.754 --> 26:02.966
It's a huge, and the Academy of Sciences was the powerful establishment body of scientists in France and in Europe.

26:03.567 --> 26:10.217
You know, and to not be admitted to membership had to be a powerful blow, and I think it influenced everything afterwards.

26:10.237 --> 26:11.299
I think everything she did,

26:11.498 --> 26:22.392
for founding that institute, for establishing her own kind of counter-establishment, you know, which developed into, really, the French counter-establishment.

26:22.512 --> 26:26.558
Yeah, that's interesting.

26:26.598 --> 26:28.000
She could have, right.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.162
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:30.182 --> 26:37.031
I think that was more Pierre than her, I suspect, although she has maintained it with, with, with, she as much as him.

26:37.492 --> 26:38.333
But I, I think,

26:38.684 --> 26:47.876
You know, later in life, she turned out to be a really brilliant fundraiser and administrator, not afraid to go after the foundations and the books.

26:48.056 --> 26:49.759
You know, she came to America twice.

26:49.799 --> 26:51.561
She established all those contacts.

26:52.202 --> 26:57.088
And that's another part of a myth, you know, that I think is unfortunate.

26:57.108 --> 27:05.800
It is that she was somehow, all of this, these trips to America and this fundraising were something that was orchestrated by somebody else, and she was just a pawn.

27:05.880 --> 27:06.801
I don't believe it.

27:06.848 --> 27:12.617
Absolutely.

27:13.097 --> 27:26.117
And I think that the daughter, like a good daughter, responded to Marie's own autobiography and to the version of the life that she had been presented with.

27:26.137 --> 27:26.978
Oh, yeah.

27:27.099 --> 27:33.328
Well, the other thing that happened, I was going to say earlier,

27:33.832 --> 27:45.577
It always happens, you know, the thing that you think is going to be the big sign isn't, and it comes from out of the blue, because the papers at the Bibliothic National were important and wonderful.

27:45.697 --> 27:51.790
But then, at this other library in the school where Pierre had taught, these other papers

27:52.276 --> 27:54.658
turned up that were unbelievable.

27:54.678 --> 28:00.404
Those were the reminiscences of the plans about the Langevin fair.

28:00.484 --> 28:02.707
Nobody had seen those.

28:02.767 --> 28:04.449
They brought me this block.

28:04.569 --> 28:07.592
Was there an embargo on them, or were they just there, waiting for you to come?

28:07.612 --> 28:08.673
No, there was an embargo.

28:08.693 --> 28:12.076
The Langevin family had had those closed.

28:12.096 --> 28:18.503
But I had a friend who was a historian of science and had written a biography of Paul Langevin.

28:18.922 --> 28:27.640
and who had connections to the launch of our family, and she knew my work and she respected it, so she spoke to them about me.

28:27.660 --> 28:38.823
So when I came to that library, the library, and walked over with this box, and I untied it, and there were these reminiscences, and they were... What do you feel when you said to them?

28:38.963 --> 28:39.023
Oh.

28:39.003 --> 28:40.665
Well, you know, my heart was pounding.

28:41.165 --> 28:42.967
It was, oh, you know the feeling.

28:43.007 --> 28:47.351
I mean, it's like, I mean, it's so bizarre because anyway, you're all alone.

28:47.571 --> 28:54.198
You're all alone in Paris, you know, and there's nobody to tell, you know, but it's like one of the most exciting moments of your life.

28:54.238 --> 28:56.380
Did they allow you to take tomato coffee?

28:56.400 --> 28:56.781
They did.

28:57.361 --> 29:03.968
It's one of those places where they were really casual and they kind of didn't know what they had, you know.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.389
Oh, really?

29:05.850 --> 29:06.170
Really?

29:06.270 --> 29:07.011
Yeah, yeah.

29:07.111 --> 29:08.352
Well, that's, you know,

29:08.855 --> 29:14.163
So I was lucky there, because they weren't used to having researchers, and there wasn't that, you know, it was great.

29:14.183 --> 29:15.105
They copied it for me.

29:15.125 --> 29:16.687
They copied it all for me, you know.

29:18.149 --> 29:19.611
And we weren't helpful.

29:20.573 --> 29:25.340
I think that was not more than maybe 100 pages, but they were incredible 100 pages.

29:25.360 --> 29:30.508
There were things like that anecdote about, no, it was one day's work.

29:30.792 --> 29:33.055
But it was just incredible stuff.

29:33.115 --> 29:33.555
Yeah.

29:34.216 --> 29:47.232
I mean, like those anecdotes about her coming to Jean Perrin's house at midnight and being afraid to go home because she's been threatened with murder by Mrs. Colangeville, you know, all that stuff is from those documents.

29:47.312 --> 29:51.357
I read where the Pampion is now accepting her.

29:51.698 --> 29:52.018
Yeah.

29:52.178 --> 29:53.080
Isn't it interesting?

29:53.240 --> 29:54.621
That's kind of ironic in a way.

29:54.682 --> 29:55.062
Yeah.

29:55.413 --> 29:58.618
It's very ironic.

29:58.718 --> 30:15.345
It's also, you know, the first idea that the feminists had was that Marie Curie should go there alone, which would have been outrageous because she was very important to her to be buried with Pierre, you know, and they're in a beautiful little cemetery, you know.

30:15.365 --> 30:18.791
I know, and Marie and Pierre hated all that stuff.

30:18.911 --> 30:21.876
So it's, you know, they would hate the whole thing.

30:22.345 --> 30:24.549
But I suppose it's good for women or something.

30:24.629 --> 30:25.972
I don't know.

30:26.232 --> 30:29.258
I mean, again, it goes back to the contributions.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.164
Yeah, they're enormous.

30:33.025 --> 30:34.248
But period is important, too.

30:34.268 --> 30:35.410
That's the other thing I really...

30:35.677 --> 30:36.578
feel strongly about.

30:36.958 --> 30:44.205
Because what used to happen is that with Pierre, he was the great scientist and she was kind of a tag along, you know, a hard worker.

30:44.225 --> 30:50.912
And recently, it's become all Marie, you know, and Pierre's kind of left out.

30:51.072 --> 31:03.945
I think he's important, too.

31:04.246 --> 31:29.235
I wanted it to be absolutely clear because I felt there was a process of empowerment that I went through taking those courses, and I wanted to pass that on to the reader, and especially women readers, because they tend to be even more afraid of science than men in general, I think.

31:29.716 --> 31:31.418
And I didn't want to lose them, you know.

31:31.718 --> 31:46.275
But on the other hand, I thought it would have been really condescending to not take her work seriously, you know, to deal only with her being her mother, you know, her mother's side and all that, you know.

31:46.556 --> 31:48.578
And it's amazing also growing up in Beaumont.

31:48.618 --> 31:51.382
I mean, there was nothing there.

31:51.402 --> 31:51.502
Yeah.

31:51.522 --> 31:52.823
No one couldn't even be educated.

31:52.843 --> 31:52.984
Right.

31:53.004 --> 31:53.504
Yeah.

31:53.524 --> 31:58.670
And I was impressed with how casual the routine was in so long.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.072
Incredible.

32:00.575 --> 32:03.079
You can just walk in.

32:03.259 --> 32:04.461
It's still that way, I believe.

32:05.262 --> 32:05.583
Exactly.

32:05.603 --> 32:06.925
Yeah, I think it is.

32:06.985 --> 32:08.988
Anybody can say they attend the Surabite.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.692
Yeah, it's pretty much like that.

32:11.952 --> 32:12.052
Yeah.

32:12.073 --> 32:13.014
Yeah.

32:13.775 --> 32:15.177
It's certainly a different tradition.

32:15.197 --> 32:23.149
Someone asked me at one of the talks I gave, is there a place here or anywhere in the world comparable to the Sorbonne in 1890?

32:23.530 --> 32:25.553
Yeah.

32:26.258 --> 32:27.279
I couldn't answer it.

32:27.299 --> 32:34.085
There was someone in the audience who was a scientist, and so I asked him, and he said that MIT would come the closest.

32:35.286 --> 32:41.251
They have graduate students from all over the world who come, but they have to have stipends, they have to finance it.

32:41.651 --> 32:48.998
You know, you can't come as a penniless whole and just start classes, you know, which is what she did.

32:49.338 --> 32:52.381
It's the other way around.

32:52.401 --> 32:56.164
Yeah, it sure is.

32:56.971 --> 33:14.936
I'm not, but I'm thinking, of course, all the time.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.800
I'm not sure.

33:17.840 --> 33:18.461
I'm not sure.

33:18.601 --> 33:24.209
I think there might be a danger in doing yet another biography.

33:24.630 --> 33:25.611
There's a way in which

33:26.114 --> 33:31.481
you know certain things, you get into grooves, you know, and I wouldn't want that to happen.

33:32.302 --> 33:40.013
Thinking about something that's closer to the present and closer to my journalism route, but I don't know what it is yet.

33:40.974 --> 33:50.728
Something more contemporary, something that could maybe make a difference, you know, I guess as we get older, you know, as I get older, I think about that, you know.

33:51.429 --> 33:55.294
I mean, I feel these books can and do, can and do make a difference, but

33:55.797 --> 34:01.928
It's something that's, I guess, more immediately impacting us.

34:02.389 --> 34:09.521
For you, and, I mean, very curiously, was there a sense of narrative as you were going along?

34:09.602 --> 34:11.545
Did you have a sense of story?

34:11.980 --> 34:19.352
I had a sense of both stories, mine and hers, and they were intertwined for me.

34:19.673 --> 34:37.802
Yeah, I felt with both books, but especially with this most recent one, I felt there was a process of empowerment, of feeling more confident and competent about mastering the science, the Polish part, the French part.

34:38.018 --> 34:49.075
you know, sort of owning, slowly owning them more and more and more, feeling entitled to take on this life, because it's a big life, you know, and it's... She's not an American.

34:49.095 --> 34:51.302
She's also not a French woman, which I think...

34:51.451 --> 34:59.506
I think I felt, I'm not sure how I would have felt writing a biography of a woman who lived her whole life in France, but this was an outsider.

34:59.646 --> 35:05.897
A lot of people don't.

35:06.619 --> 35:07.881
A lot of people don't.

35:07.901 --> 35:11.628
And of course in Poland she's an enormously important person.

35:11.988 --> 35:13.932
Yeah, it's true though.

35:13.912 --> 35:18.164
She's on the 20,000th wadi note, which is like a dollar bill.

35:18.284 --> 35:21.212
And she's everywhere.

35:22.475 --> 35:24.681
French currency, 500 currency.

35:25.143 --> 35:27.128
I was thinking of getting one, but it's $100.

35:27.817 --> 35:47.026
Yes, it's being published by Odile Jacob in 1996, and they're celebrating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of radioactivity next year, so the timing couldn't be better.

35:47.968 --> 35:51.613
Plus, there's stuff about the Pantheon.

35:51.695 --> 35:55.260
So, really, the book comes out and then you get the French deal?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.161
I'm taking it by your own.

35:56.381 --> 36:00.046
Actually, the French deal was on the basis of the galley.

36:00.506 --> 36:00.827
Really?

36:00.927 --> 36:01.828
Yeah.

36:01.848 --> 36:05.212
And the English deal, I have an English deal, too, and that was much earlier.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.834
I bet you'll have an English deal.

36:06.854 --> 36:07.836
Oh, we've already had queries.

36:08.156 --> 36:09.197
I'm sure.

36:09.378 --> 36:12.602
I'm going to read a chapter of Wolvertonia.

36:12.782 --> 36:13.042
Uh-huh.

36:13.283 --> 36:14.084
Oh, yeah.

36:14.144 --> 36:15.205
Natural for England.

36:15.185 --> 36:18.432
Yeah, I know.

36:19.233 --> 36:21.839
Mine's being published by Heinemann, which I think is quite good.

36:21.939 --> 36:24.083
Yeah, yeah.

36:24.244 --> 36:25.947
I don't know.

36:26.168 --> 36:29.334
Have I missed anything?

36:29.354 --> 36:33.583
I mean, you know, I could go on and on.

36:33.663 --> 36:34.645
I mean, she didn't.

36:35.047 --> 36:36.469
I got closer.

36:36.589 --> 36:37.310
I got closer.

36:37.370 --> 36:40.133
There was a point, I'll tell you a point that was really important for me.

36:40.474 --> 36:47.742
In these diaries at the Bibliotech Nacional, she kept a record of her own body weight.

36:47.762 --> 36:53.830
And when she was quite ill, when this scandal occurred, she lost a huge amount of weight, maybe 15 pounds.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.171
And it's down there.

36:56.093 --> 37:00.598
And then, absolutely, ever the finest, with her children, with herself.

37:01.068 --> 37:09.736
And after looking at those figures, then I went and walked by her apartment house on Quai de Betune, which is right on the stand.

37:10.437 --> 37:13.279
And the doors of the apartment house are huge.

37:13.880 --> 37:19.145
They're maybe 20 feet high, all carved, you know, the way French doors can be.

37:19.785 --> 37:24.129
And I thought of this little figure opening that door and how heavy it would be for her.

37:24.730 --> 37:29.134
And it was a moment of connection, you know, I felt...

37:29.553 --> 37:41.335
At that moment I knew her, I could feel her.

37:41.467 --> 37:47.337
and I go to see this guy in Princeton, New Jersey, and I don't even know what to do.

37:47.357 --> 37:50.742
I'm meeting my mother in 15 minutes at the paper store on Carroll Street.

37:50.762 --> 37:54.389
So let's just get a couple of quick things, and I'm going to ask you to describe this for me.

37:54.409 --> 37:54.909
Sure, let's go.

37:54.929 --> 37:57.954
If you give me your address, then I'll send you a copy.

37:58.195 --> 38:00.559
Good, yeah, yeah.

38:00.579 --> 38:03.804
Do you want to Kate Scott's name?

38:03.824 --> 38:04.145
Yeah.

38:04.185 --> 38:04.285
Yeah.

38:04.265 --> 38:06.228
Oh, the copy of her?

38:06.329 --> 38:06.909
Yeah.

38:06.970 --> 38:07.811
She's magnificent.

38:07.851 --> 38:10.536
Well, I'd like to have her name, because it'll be a while.

38:10.996 --> 38:18.409
She was hired by the production editor, who was the form writer of Princeton University Press, and said, we're getting a scroll for this.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.614
And she found stock book life.

38:22.055 --> 38:23.117
You can't believe it.

38:23.097 --> 38:28.562
Especially in that kind of book, you really need somebody to use it.

38:29.603 --> 38:33.266
I asked you about, yes, and tell me about the daughter once more.

38:33.286 --> 38:35.148
Was she helpful for you?

38:35.248 --> 38:39.432
Even after all these years, did you protect the myth?

38:40.292 --> 38:41.113
I think the latter.

38:41.513 --> 38:51.062
She was extremely gracious and said that everything she knew about her mother was in her book.

38:51.532 --> 39:16.189
and she claimed that her memory she had no memory for these things anymore which may be true um and i would need to go and write my own book and that was pretty much the message but she was she was not um she was not angry or obstructionist she didn't hinder you but she didn't necessarily help you exactly yeah yeah neutral yeah i would say that would you say she was encouraging

39:16.405 --> 39:18.590
Um, no, I wouldn't say terribly.

39:18.630 --> 39:21.356
Does she still have a sense of her mother's greatness?

39:21.476 --> 39:23.520
Yes, yes, very much, yes.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.625
She's a beautiful woman.

39:25.905 --> 39:31.036
Eve was, yes, very, very pretty, and she's still quite an elegant woman.

39:31.337 --> 39:33.141
Okay, that's a good point.

39:33.161 --> 39:33.923
Is that all right with you?

39:33.963 --> 39:34.243
Sure.

39:34.364 --> 39:35.005
And if...
