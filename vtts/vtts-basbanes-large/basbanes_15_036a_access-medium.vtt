WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:03.574
Dave.

00:16.889 --> 00:23.617
That's Debbie.

00:25.419 --> 00:28.603
That's Debbie.

00:29.208 --> 00:34.956
Short run, I really don't see a lot of room for optimism.

00:34.976 --> 00:49.416
I mean, as far as people's lives, as I observe them in America now, people's lives seem to me to be filled with fear and anger and alienation.

00:49.476 --> 00:57.527
I mean, I don't think that the country is being consumed by it, but those elements loom very large in

00:57.963 --> 00:59.985
And I think it goes beyond America.

01:00.125 --> 01:14.718
I think that fear, anger, alienation are much more a part of all of us than we really want to admit.

01:15.458 --> 01:21.143
But I think until we face it, we really can't act against it.

01:21.624 --> 01:25.107
And I think we're not just talking about America there.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.649
We're talking about humanity in general.

01:28.507 --> 01:32.252
And, uh... Same here.

01:34.195 --> 01:40.403
Uh, I mean, you know, I try and... All right, we're on again.

01:41.324 --> 01:46.391
I don't actually remember where you were, but I think you put a period out of it.

01:46.411 --> 01:57.045
You know, I mean, I don't deny the, you know, the humor and the, you know, the...

01:58.139 --> 02:03.587
joy in life that gets us through the day, that's part of everybody's life, too.

02:04.568 --> 02:07.132
And I try to get that into the book.

02:07.212 --> 02:10.858
I mean, there is a lot of humor in almost everything I've written.

02:10.938 --> 02:15.064
Sometimes... I think more so in this book, maybe, than the other three.

02:15.725 --> 02:18.729
Well, I like... You think... Is that... That may be.

02:18.749 --> 02:19.911
I think it may be.

02:19.991 --> 02:25.279
I think there's some in all of them, but this one... I mean, Hall of Mirrors had a lot of humor.

02:25.359 --> 02:27.522
I was about to say, Hall of Mirrors was...

02:27.704 --> 02:34.376
And this one is, I mean, I think we're allowed to laugh at these people.

02:34.957 --> 02:51.045
You know, they are a kind of gallery of, all of them related to incidents that are true about somebody in Hollywood somewhere.

02:51.363 --> 02:54.848
I can't really do portraits from life, and I don't.

02:55.408 --> 02:57.150
People you knew, by the way?

02:57.651 --> 02:59.934
Or people I knew about.

02:59.994 --> 03:03.799
I mean, these incidents resemble various incidents.

03:04.039 --> 03:11.369
I mean, you know, if you took the last days of John Belushi, I mean, you know, I couldn't, it would be hard to fictionalize that.

03:11.409 --> 03:20.020
I mean, surely you'd have something that would come out far more fractured, or at least as fractured as what happens to these people in the

03:20.371 --> 03:31.290
Is an actual case like that in your mind, I mean, when you're creating, when you're... No, not really.

03:31.350 --> 03:34.475
I mean, it really is very cumulative.

03:34.655 --> 03:42.008
Well, it's just, I mean, there is no resemblance between the Belushi world, particularly, and what happens in this book.

03:42.108 --> 03:43.130
Except the excesses.

03:43.230 --> 03:44.893
The excesses, yes.

03:45.380 --> 04:00.742
I mean, if you go back through the history of motion pictures and the history of the industry generally, you certainly find people as confused and crazy and druggy and so forth as these people.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.444
Now, we spoke about your vision.

04:03.946 --> 04:07.070
How does this work with the creative process?

04:07.271 --> 04:10.375
I mean, how does that translate into the making of a novel?

04:10.793 --> 04:19.522
I mean, do you have this vision, as you say, of America, of alienation or whatever, and then do we work on a novel from there?

04:19.782 --> 04:22.185
Or does the novel develop from the vision?

04:22.225 --> 04:24.487
Maybe I'm not articulating this.

04:24.727 --> 04:34.057
No, I think what I do, what I always compulsively do, is I make up stories, which I've done since I was a child.

04:34.657 --> 04:36.539
And I'm more interested in the characters.

04:36.619 --> 04:38.421
I mean, on the workaday level,

04:38.806 --> 04:49.336
And I'm really more interested in getting the characters to work coherently and convincingly than I am in serving a vision as such.

04:49.437 --> 04:53.781
I mean, the vision takes care of itself, so to speak.

04:53.801 --> 04:54.642
I mean, that's there.

04:54.702 --> 04:55.863
That's the informing.

04:55.923 --> 04:58.626
The vision is part of the way I am.

04:58.706 --> 04:59.587
That's me.

05:00.548 --> 05:04.932
And so it's going to come out that way because it's me writing it.

05:05.317 --> 05:07.199
I don't have to consciously do that.

05:07.540 --> 05:11.124
It does itself, because it's me writing it.

05:11.144 --> 05:20.495
Now, I did not know, in fact, I knew very little of your personal history prior to this novel, even though we had done a previous story.

05:20.515 --> 05:25.521
But so much has been made about your mother's medical history.

05:25.541 --> 05:29.546
I never said, I mean, all of a sudden I decided to say it.

05:29.606 --> 05:31.088
I just never told anybody before.

05:32.705 --> 05:34.287
Why is that, I wonder?

05:35.368 --> 05:39.093
She's the model, obviously, or a model?

05:39.914 --> 05:42.137
No, it's not that she's a model for the character.

05:42.277 --> 05:48.585
It's that the vocabulary and the manner, the language.

05:50.086 --> 05:56.855
I mean, my mother was a kind of schizophrenic who was really absolutely functioning.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.438
Well, sort of functioning.

06:00.262 --> 06:05.414
There are schizoids who function much better than she does.

06:06.797 --> 06:18.945
I once was acquainted with a professional man who I suspect is a schizophrenic, I suspect very strongly because of various things that I recognize.

06:19.330 --> 06:25.219
This man functions as a professional and is quite successful in his career as a professional.

06:25.239 --> 06:26.281
And you can pick it right off.

06:26.301 --> 06:27.102
Yeah, yeah.

06:27.202 --> 06:41.585
I can tell by the... There are certain things that are very, very difficult to describe, and I can't even... I mean, to put it into... To even try to describe an incident where you identify the individual, so I can't really do that.

06:41.745 --> 06:46.873
And it's also very hard to describe how that...

06:47.039 --> 07:00.676
But the association, the thing about the associative process and the way of a certain manner of speech that, boy, just rings a big bell when you want to come across it.

07:00.696 --> 07:13.131
The fellow who reviewed this book for me, I ran it a week ago Sunday, so I'm sure you haven't seen it yet because we'll just send him to tears.

07:13.229 --> 07:16.614
strong parallels between this novel and Under the Volcano.

07:16.634 --> 07:19.939
And I wonder, is this coincidental?

07:21.481 --> 07:28.751
Well, that's been said before of, you know, of other novels of mine.

07:28.771 --> 07:42.190
I think it really is the drug-induced vision, in a way, and maybe the presence of a mountain, you know, kind of a

07:43.503 --> 07:48.089
A mountain which is the border between the two worlds.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.353
And then, of course, Mexico and the movies, too.

07:51.714 --> 07:53.997
So, I mean, there are a number of parallels.

07:54.297 --> 07:58.803
But I don't think the parallels are very important.

07:59.704 --> 08:06.853
I don't see it as really being like... I mean, I like Under the Volcano very much, but I don't think this book would really like it.

08:08.275 --> 08:12.160
Except that there are similarities in the...

08:12.562 --> 08:17.547
central characters, great dependence on things.

08:17.867 --> 08:26.375
This is something that seems to run through all of your books.

08:26.415 --> 08:30.018
Some place we're going to find drugs or alcohol.

08:30.679 --> 08:34.602
Is this a metaphor for anything or is it just a world that you happen to know rather well?

08:34.702 --> 08:37.025
Well, it's all those things.

08:37.085 --> 08:41.809
It's a metaphor for delusion and desire.

08:43.055 --> 08:45.538
And it's also a world that I know something about.

08:46.539 --> 09:00.593
And it's also a way of access, a means of access to different states of consciousness.

09:00.693 --> 09:07.159
It is key to open, that opens a certain area of consciousness.

09:08.401 --> 09:12.825
I think that I have probably done all that I'm going to do.

09:13.261 --> 09:29.599
in that area i mean i've used it you know quite quite enough i think in future i really should but i think i have to get my character to take it i mean they really they really i read somewhere i forget which maybe it was the paris review interview

09:29.900 --> 09:31.142
where you would like to write a play?

09:31.563 --> 09:32.304
Yeah.

09:32.324 --> 09:33.786
Is it something you're working on?

09:34.067 --> 09:35.589
I haven't really started it yet.

09:35.629 --> 09:49.793
I'm debating whether I should, as I probably could, spend next year at the Actors Studio every Monday at the Writers and Directors Workshop.

09:49.833 --> 09:53.199
I see Paul Newman fairly often.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.464
They're neighbors, that's right.

09:56.647 --> 10:00.632
and he suggested the possibility.

10:00.752 --> 10:07.981
So I'm thinking of it, although at the moment what I'm working on is a short story, a long short story.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.302
Where will we see that?

10:09.322 --> 10:11.204
Are you under contract with that?

10:11.224 --> 10:13.427
No, no.

10:13.587 --> 10:20.055
My fiction has most frequently of late been published in Esquire, but I have no commitment to it.

10:20.693 --> 10:23.918
And I ask that question strictly as a collector.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.099
Oh, no.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.942
No, I might show up.

10:27.222 --> 10:30.427
If it doesn't have any four-letter words, I may hit the New Yorker with it.

10:30.447 --> 10:40.101
I mean, for going back a long way, Linda Asher has asked me for stuff that I don't write.

10:40.121 --> 10:42.284
Have you been to the New Yorker?

10:42.464 --> 10:43.205
No, no.

10:43.545 --> 10:45.929
That would be a very interesting exercise, wouldn't it?

10:45.949 --> 10:47.511
For you, I think.

10:47.879 --> 10:49.722
Yes, it would.

10:49.802 --> 10:55.650
I mean, I have a lot of respect for the New Yorker.

10:55.670 --> 10:57.132
But you're not John Cheever.

10:57.332 --> 11:02.800
I'm not John Cheever, and the New Yorker really doesn't take stuff with four letter words.

11:02.840 --> 11:14.376
I mean, this story, which is about protective service work, which my wife did for a while.

11:15.352 --> 11:17.136
A nuts and bolts question.

11:17.336 --> 11:23.789
Of all the pieces I've read in the last couple weeks, I've seen your age variously listed at 48, 47, and 46.

11:24.009 --> 11:27.056
It hasn't been me.

11:27.196 --> 11:30.222
It's 48.

11:30.488 --> 11:37.355
I have 48 in Newsweek, 47 in Time, I think, and 46 in Publishers Week.

11:37.455 --> 11:38.916
Nothing matters.

11:38.936 --> 11:42.680
Maybe I can establish it in 46 and float it around there for a couple of years.

11:42.880 --> 11:47.665
But you're not a boxer, so you don't need those a couple of years.

11:47.685 --> 11:55.412
I guess every one of your novels has had some relationship to an actual experience of yours.

11:55.472 --> 11:56.833
You've been a scriptwriter.

11:56.853 --> 11:58.555
You spent time in New Orleans.

11:59.041 --> 12:02.345
You spent several months in Vietnam.

12:02.365 --> 12:07.290
You went to Central America and looked around.

12:07.551 --> 12:10.734
I mean, are these kind of field trips for you?

12:10.754 --> 12:15.259
I mean, consciously, unconsciously, or is it just a question of using every experience?

12:15.339 --> 12:21.046
I think it's a question of using every experience, and yet I'm not an autobiographical writer.

12:21.106 --> 12:26.432
I use places and situations.

12:27.037 --> 12:32.145
But I don't, you know, I mean, there are some writers who are autobiographical.

12:32.165 --> 12:33.207
That's not my instinct.

12:33.427 --> 12:39.877
I really prefer to make up stories that, you know, that I'm not immediately in.

12:41.079 --> 12:47.529
Like, in the same way that I don't take characters from life, I don't, you know, render myself either.

12:47.549 --> 12:51.615
I mean, although I have things in common with all of my characters.

12:51.955 --> 12:52.336
All of them.

12:52.356 --> 12:52.777
All of them.

12:52.797 --> 12:53.298
Just about.

12:54.179 --> 12:54.259
Hmm.

12:54.560 --> 13:00.069
And yet they are all individuals with unique voices.

13:02.032 --> 13:16.075
But I mean, I think, you know, I always said about Hall of Mirrors, my first one, that there was plenty of me in Reinhardt, but also in Geraldine, and also in Rainey.

13:16.556 --> 13:17.918
One of my very favorite...

13:18.421 --> 13:21.204
great first novels is all theirs.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.986
I have three favorites.

13:24.006 --> 13:24.527
That's one.

13:25.688 --> 13:27.029
The Movie Goer is another.

13:27.750 --> 13:31.754
That's my other one.

13:31.874 --> 13:33.916
Lie Down in Darkness.

13:33.936 --> 13:38.020
Lie Down in Darkness happens to be spectacular.

13:40.282 --> 13:42.825
Catch-22 I've always, Joe Heller's.

13:43.606 --> 13:45.327
That was a very interesting year, 1961.

13:45.768 --> 13:48.090
Catch-22, The Movie Goer, Rabbit Run.

13:48.695 --> 13:52.961
And as a collector, these are bibliographical things that you come across.

13:53.322 --> 13:54.844
That was the Poor House Fair, wasn't it?

13:54.864 --> 13:55.165
Really?

13:55.185 --> 13:55.465
No, no, no.

13:56.006 --> 13:59.852
Poor House Fair was, Rabbit Run was the first of the rabbit books.

13:59.872 --> 14:00.553
Oh, the rabbit books.

14:01.514 --> 14:02.696
Poor House Fair came earlier.

14:03.998 --> 14:05.661
That was 59, I think.

14:08.144 --> 14:08.966
You tend to remember.

14:08.986 --> 14:11.409
But it was a very fertile year.

14:11.449 --> 14:17.098
Malcolm Cowley has written about, he's very interested in chronology and dates and when to.

14:17.382 --> 14:22.710
for reasons, you know, why all of a sudden is there a flood of creative work?

14:22.730 --> 14:24.774
When was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?

14:24.794 --> 14:26.156
That was about 1960.

14:26.556 --> 14:28.359
I want to check it.

14:28.439 --> 14:33.287
He was 60 because sometimes the great notion was 63.

14:33.347 --> 14:35.290
I knew Ken was finishing it.

14:35.310 --> 14:36.872
I just saw him, by the way, in Adelaide.

14:36.952 --> 14:41.179
I've been in, you know, as I say, I've been in Australia.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.911
He and Faye were in Adelaide.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.253
He's not writing anymore.

14:48.094 --> 15:00.466
He has done a bunch of occasional pieces for Rolling Stone and other publications, and he has a book coming out, which is not a novel, but a book of mostly those occasional pieces.

15:00.747 --> 15:01.627
Collective prose.

15:01.667 --> 15:02.668
Some of it is really good.

15:03.009 --> 15:04.891
He has a piece on the death of John Lennon.

15:05.311 --> 15:07.133
It's a very great, very nice piece.

15:07.687 --> 15:13.036
It's called The Demon Box, and it's coming out either this spring or sometime in the summer.

15:15.159 --> 15:24.314
The King Lear, Christopher Leeuwenhoff, I thought, you read all the reviews, I read about a dozen reviews, and you're always looking for something a little different.

15:24.795 --> 15:30.404
And I really liked his, he really picked up on the Lear thing, the mad scene.

15:30.444 --> 15:33.188
Yeah, and that's definitely there.

15:33.337 --> 15:34.639
That was wonderful.

15:34.939 --> 15:37.402
And here I am a Shakespearean.

15:38.783 --> 15:42.768
And that scene didn't connect with me when I read it.

15:42.788 --> 15:47.774
And I said, jerk, of course it should have, it must have, and by design, I'm sure.

15:48.635 --> 15:55.503
Well, it even has a little hut, you know, for him to ask to come in.

15:55.823 --> 16:00.829
And she says, if I'm not mistaken, I think I'll read, you know.

16:01.332 --> 16:05.158
I'll rest, but first I'll pray, which is a line right out of that series.

16:05.178 --> 16:09.063
You know, I went back to it after I read Christopher's review.

16:10.485 --> 16:11.066
Absolutely.

16:11.787 --> 16:15.793
Now, again, you had, this is something I just read.

16:15.813 --> 16:19.779
I had played, I didn't play Lear, I played Kent.

16:19.799 --> 16:21.120
That's a good character.

16:21.141 --> 16:22.422
Yeah.

16:22.522 --> 16:24.285
You're a secondary character.

16:24.569 --> 16:28.273
I had, you know, I had trained as an actor a long time ago.

16:29.634 --> 16:42.167
When I first got out of the service, I went to Teigen Berghaus for a period of some months, and I think I was in the same, I was there about the same time as Jamie Dennis.

16:42.287 --> 16:46.231
I don't usually say that publicly, because it tells her sort of her age.

16:46.291 --> 16:49.494
She looks good.

16:49.695 --> 16:51.977
Yeah, she does.

16:52.413 --> 16:54.437
Do you credit this early training?

16:54.457 --> 17:01.890
I mean, you have wonderful dialogue, crisp, quotable dialogue.

17:01.970 --> 17:06.879
Well, I really studied acting to understand theater.

17:06.919 --> 17:11.147
I was more ambitious as a playwright than I was as an actor.

17:11.718 --> 17:16.204
And I was probably right in that, because I really didn't get very far.

17:17.686 --> 17:19.548
Although I love it, and I do it occasionally.

17:19.808 --> 17:26.397
Now I could, if I had the time, because in middle-aged men, there's always a great call for middle-aged men.

17:26.417 --> 17:33.105
There are lots of young actors, and there are lots of old actors, but middle-aged actors are difficult to find.

17:33.125 --> 17:38.552
But every once in a while I discharge this energy and desire by...

17:38.887 --> 17:40.028
playing something.

17:40.069 --> 17:44.634
And that was something I fell into, almost accidental.

17:44.655 --> 17:48.399
And it was kind of fortunate that I did, I think.

17:48.419 --> 17:52.625
It gave me a running theme for the novel.

17:53.606 --> 17:58.853
I think between this novel and the last one is about four years, right?

17:59.339 --> 18:02.323
Yeah, well, it's necessary.

18:02.604 --> 18:12.437
One of the guilts that pursues me through life is the paucity of output, and I really want to try and make up for that.

18:12.457 --> 18:21.550
I want to keep my standards of quality, but I've always been kind of lazy and not very efficient in the way I worked.

18:21.968 --> 18:27.273
I really want to get what I want to say said in so far as I can.

18:27.293 --> 18:28.674
Is each one better than the last?

18:28.694 --> 18:31.977
Every writer always feels that way.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.598
I hope so.

18:33.899 --> 18:36.621
I think we all should keep learning.

18:38.022 --> 18:41.665
I think I'm still learning how to write novels.

18:41.866 --> 18:43.007
I hope so.

18:44.448 --> 18:47.451
I think you learn a little something every year.

18:47.471 --> 18:50.153
I think the great danger

18:50.639 --> 18:52.582
is self-indulgence.

18:54.244 --> 18:58.050
You start doing things that you can easily master.

18:59.632 --> 19:12.732
You begin to confuse your own private fetishes and hang-ups with what's important from a literary point of view, and pretty soon you're...

19:15.209 --> 19:17.334
Can I get a beer?

19:17.555 --> 19:21.806
What kind of beer is it?

19:21.866 --> 19:32.813
There's a very interesting, let me just check this out.

19:34.430 --> 19:35.231
Not really.

19:35.251 --> 19:37.716
I don't have to change my home basis very much.

19:37.816 --> 19:39.159
I mean, just from Amherst.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.681
I mean, I was in Amherst all the time.

19:40.701 --> 19:45.771
My kids were always, my kids were teenagers.

19:45.791 --> 19:47.955
When they left home, I moved down to Connecticut.

19:47.995 --> 19:50.519
I mean, I do travel a lot.

19:51.621 --> 19:53.344
I think I'll do a little bit less of that.

19:53.424 --> 19:55.408
I'm finally getting it out of my system.

19:56.587 --> 20:01.774
I was in Egypt last spring doing a travel option for Esquire.

20:02.074 --> 20:04.398
We were away six weeks doing that.

20:04.418 --> 20:11.848
And now I'm down in Connecticut.

20:12.989 --> 20:17.776
I don't expect to travel quite as much.

20:17.796 --> 20:20.559
But you moved from Amherst to Connecticut.

20:20.579 --> 20:22.222
That's home now.

20:23.183 --> 20:23.944
Yeah.

20:24.177 --> 20:33.526
Well, everyone keeps asking me about Vietnam as the central metaphor.

20:33.546 --> 20:37.089
It certainly doesn't appear in any form of one of your novels.

20:37.650 --> 20:41.133
Well, I mean, you mentioned it.

20:41.193 --> 20:48.340
I think it's mentioned parenthetically, it's like the sunrise, but it certainly is a central wrestling event there.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.564
But why is everyone coming back to Vietnam when it really only figures

20:52.679 --> 20:59.726
And even then, almost obliquely, in the second novel, why is that?

20:59.766 --> 21:02.709
Are you consumed with the Vietnam experience?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.571
No, I'm not, I'm not consumed with it.

21:04.611 --> 21:14.441
It's very important to me, but I don't think it, you know, I think it was a very important, a central event of, you know, of my generation.

21:14.821 --> 21:20.827
But, uh, I'm not consumed with it.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.028
I mean, I think we have to,

21:22.193 --> 21:46.243
you know put it behind me i will probably you know write about it again when people affected by it it's hard not to run into it and people of a certain age but it's the event of my life along the way that world war ii was with those guys i mean

21:49.126 --> 21:55.196
It's heavily affected what became of my life, where I am.

21:55.216 --> 22:03.369
I was in the Navy for three and a half years on a ship in the late 60s, early 70s, in public affairs.

22:03.389 --> 22:07.075
You were a journalist, I guess, about 2003.

22:07.095 --> 22:16.129
I was having the officer in charge in Vietnam, so we did stuff every day.

22:17.189 --> 22:19.412
You know, it's a thing.

22:21.094 --> 22:27.283
And I can remember nights standing in bridge watches and watching the flares over the DMZ.

22:27.303 --> 22:30.988
I mean, we were never, we slept in clean sheets at night in that space.

22:31.970 --> 22:32.631
Drank scotch.

22:34.433 --> 22:35.595
Illegally.

22:35.615 --> 22:40.181
You know, it does, it does certainly shape your life.

22:43.586 --> 22:45.288
I'll turn this off.

22:45.308 --> 22:46.470
So you know that this is my name.

22:47.311 --> 22:50.015
I'm sorry, are you going to say something?

22:50.315 --> 23:08.040
Oh, well, I was going to say, I only say that a lot of the lifers either left the surface than the height of Vietnam, because it was from so many, and it seemed so out of control, it was so different from the life that they could practice for.

23:08.060 --> 23:12.927
But you know, I look back on it, I never thought I'd admit this.

23:14.629 --> 23:16.212
Fifteen years, sixteen years later.

23:16.232 --> 23:17.233
I enjoyed it.

23:18.007 --> 23:23.492
Look at those pictures of a longer podium in the news with the bar girls attacking us.

23:24.033 --> 23:26.095
Everybody at work.

23:26.776 --> 23:28.517
God, wouldn't you love to be back there?

23:29.158 --> 23:40.469
Oh, there was a wonderful story in the Wall Street Journal a couple months ago about how a longer podium has been cleaned up and how there was one bar and everybody up was on the stage holding hands singing We Are The World.

23:40.489 --> 23:45.094
Can you imagine the sailors doing that?

23:45.513 --> 23:54.084
I've asked you a lot of questions.

23:55.686 --> 24:02.775
The movies, were you really looking to make a comment on the whole lifestyle, cultural type of a thing?

24:03.676 --> 24:11.166
I was looking at the movies as an area of the American experience.

24:11.669 --> 24:40.444
one of the things that struck me about the industry was the gratuitous cruelty and the unnecessary brutality of a vocabulary of brutality that is really rather jarring now I don't know but that same thing doesn't exist in the automobile industry I don't know those

24:41.133 --> 24:49.361
And you really don't come up with the ranks in the movies.

24:49.581 --> 24:59.011
Many of them are just thrown out there.

24:59.111 --> 25:01.553
Oh, absolutely.

25:02.214 --> 25:10.262
I mean, suddenly, you know, turn up at the age of twenty-eight.

25:10.327 --> 25:26.288
winning and losing, and the contemptibility of losing, of not making it, and the, you know, it makes for, I guess it makes for fear, which in turn makes for cruelty and brutality.

25:28.191 --> 25:34.900
And I thought it was all very American and very pertinent to the American experience.

25:35.420 --> 25:44.851
You said earlier, one of the first questions was that you don't see much to be optimistic about, but would you say that you are an optimist or a pessimist?

25:44.871 --> 25:48.055
In the long run, I'm an optimist.

25:48.075 --> 25:49.657
Of course, in the long run, we're all dead.

25:50.778 --> 26:04.515
But, I mean, I really believe that in the idea of the advancement of consciousness

26:04.833 --> 26:06.876
the furthering of it.

26:06.896 --> 26:18.996
I think the more we perceive, the more sharply and acutely we perceive ourselves and come to understand, you know, who we are and what we like, the better off somehow we'll be.

26:20.238 --> 26:22.943
And then that process is going on, I hope.

26:24.986 --> 26:26.489
So in the long run, I'm an optimist.

26:27.731 --> 26:29.794
But in the short run,

26:30.500 --> 26:43.455
with this being the end of an era, the end of a cycle of persecution, wherein European domination and the domination of European defending people is coming to an end.

26:44.135 --> 26:49.882
The old empires, including the American Empire, is really kind of a folding up.

26:50.062 --> 26:53.086
That's the Russian Empire, too.

26:53.606 --> 26:59.713
It's where we have all the symptoms and all the maladies of

26:59.845 --> 27:04.952
an age in recession.

27:04.972 --> 27:14.884
Do you think that you're speaking, you mentioned the 60s as being a time of particular interest to you.

27:14.904 --> 27:20.672
Are you writing about for people of the 60s, or would you say for your generation?

27:20.792 --> 27:22.394
Isn't that a little wider than the 60s?

27:22.474 --> 27:26.739
Oh, I hope it's a little wider than just people from the 60s.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.722
I mean, that conditions as our

27:29.123 --> 27:30.805
you know, as our age.

27:31.266 --> 27:35.992
But you were offered it often, repeatedly, I think, in the 60s.

27:36.452 --> 27:46.145
Yeah, I mean, I think I can still do that, partly because it's not only I who, you know, used the 60s, and I feel that the 60s is significant.

27:46.165 --> 27:51.672
It's not only guys like you and me, you know, who were young in the 60s.

27:52.529 --> 28:07.512
I mean, not only can they not remember Vietnam, but, you know, I mean, I think it's a lot of, you know, it's a lot of, you know, it's artificial nostalgia, because they really weren't, you know, hardly around.

28:07.612 --> 28:21.473
You run into, I mean, since I teach on and off, I really teach three, you know, 20-year-olds who are 20, 21-year-olds.

28:22.178 --> 28:31.571
In spite of the fact, I guess I should say, that they really are fixated on the 60s.

28:31.591 --> 28:33.734
It's funny, my niece was getting married for so much.

28:34.636 --> 28:35.577
She says she's 22.

28:36.919 --> 28:40.184
And I forget the joke, but it was a joke.

28:40.224 --> 28:41.726
It was not a very nice joke.

28:41.746 --> 28:44.290
It was about Ted Kennedy and Jeff Aquittic.

28:44.390 --> 28:48.135
And I think the punchline in Germany was very joke-off.

28:48.706 --> 28:52.573
She's an honor student.

28:53.555 --> 28:56.761
She didn't know who the hell.

28:57.682 --> 29:00.227
I said, of course, she was only four years old.

29:00.768 --> 29:03.372
How could she possibly know?

29:04.675 --> 29:09.263
You seem, to me, quite able to articulate your craft.

29:10.306 --> 29:13.130
I mean, is this something you should think about, what the writer does?

29:13.150 --> 29:15.513
Or do you write?

29:15.814 --> 29:19.078
I mean, is this a trade, or is this an artistic calling?

29:19.098 --> 29:20.019
Obviously, both.

29:20.861 --> 29:22.503
Well, it's not a trade.

29:22.523 --> 29:24.746
But you articulated it very well, I think.

29:24.806 --> 29:37.984
I think that's what I got out of teaching, that I really had to speak about the process of writing and what it was for.

29:38.521 --> 29:39.522
and what it was worth.

29:41.264 --> 29:56.823
And not being inchoate about it, or speaking of it as something ineffable, but really to define what I saw its function to be.

29:57.584 --> 30:03.050
And when you're speaking to college students, you've got to be as specific and as lucid as you can be.

30:03.070 --> 30:06.975
So I think that I really had my back to the wall

30:07.343 --> 30:11.870
You know, and really people were saying to me, you know, all right, what is it about?

30:12.050 --> 30:12.991
What is writing?

30:13.012 --> 30:14.293
What's it for?

30:14.333 --> 30:15.075
What good is it?

30:15.115 --> 30:15.655
Thank you.

30:17.018 --> 30:27.854
So I think that was university teaching that compelled me to define my work and the work of the writer.

30:27.874 --> 30:31.599
Did you try deliberately to be enigmatic about your title?

30:31.680 --> 30:34.684
I've seen three theories operating.

30:35.069 --> 30:43.437
several quotes from the Bible, Matthew Arnold, he's the children of life, and everyone is picking his own hero's success.

30:43.657 --> 31:04.637
One to one Thessalonians, yeah, well, one to one Thessalonians certainly applies, but it's that, I mean, you really do better, I mean, the tenor of that is that people with talent should serve their talent and not face over, keep their heads together.

31:04.887 --> 31:09.357
But it's also that little.

31:09.438 --> 31:13.748
It's also about movies.

31:13.768 --> 31:19.040
I mean, movies that are made out of light and shadow.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.225
And everyone I've discussed the book with.

31:21.897 --> 31:25.101
But there was a brilliant use of The Awakening.

31:25.602 --> 31:26.643
Oh, yeah.

31:27.083 --> 31:28.025
Now, how does that go?

31:28.045 --> 31:31.489
Is this just something that occurred to you that maybe somebody ought to try it?

31:31.649 --> 31:32.410
Yeah, really.

31:32.450 --> 31:33.992
That's the way I came to it.

31:34.052 --> 31:36.956
I was working in the Hermes College Library.

31:36.976 --> 31:44.265
I was working down the end of the room in a borrowed office where American literature and criticism were kept.

31:44.285 --> 31:47.048
And for some reason, The Awakening wasn't among the novels.

31:47.108 --> 31:48.210
It was in that section.

31:48.350 --> 31:50.132
Probably because it was part of a feminist...

31:50.433 --> 31:52.656
Of course.

31:52.676 --> 31:53.478
And I picked it out.

31:55.120 --> 32:00.108
And I took it out as my reading, my recreational reading.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.069
I've never read the novel.

32:01.770 --> 32:02.431
But it wasn't bad.

32:02.531 --> 32:11.465
I mean, it's a kind of a country, provincial Madame Bovary.

32:11.525 --> 32:16.212
One can speak of a provincial Madame Bovary since Madame Bovary itself is provincial.

32:17.074 --> 32:19.377
But an American Madame Bovary.

32:19.508 --> 32:21.312
Kate Chopin was kind of an interesting woman.

32:21.372 --> 32:25.963
She was originally Cato Flaherty from St.

32:25.983 --> 32:26.284
Louis.

32:26.304 --> 32:30.073
Her father was rather famous, and the better is fine.

32:31.817 --> 32:38.192
And after the Civil War, she went south and she married a planter named Chopin.

32:38.881 --> 32:40.423
who died quite young.

32:41.504 --> 32:44.387
Lee Chauvin is Polish.

32:44.407 --> 32:45.167
Is this guy Polish?

32:45.268 --> 32:55.478
No, but Chauvin's name is... Chauvin was half Polish, and his father is French, so that is a French name.

32:55.498 --> 32:59.882
And Chauvin was her married name, and her husband died.

32:59.902 --> 33:08.331
She took over the running of this very big plantation north of New Orleans, and she wrote a series of books

33:08.564 --> 33:37.947
a series of stories which were very successful at first and then she wrote the awakening which so shocked america in 98 99 i think it was around 98 99 for the you know for the liberation and the attitude of a woman i mean she didn't even see this she didn't anticipate this kind of direction and she was roundly just eyes you know and all you know harper's weekly and

33:39.040 --> 33:42.888
All the critics are just shocked.

33:42.989 --> 33:43.830
Liberty now.

33:44.191 --> 33:45.634
Has it been rediscovered today?

33:45.654 --> 33:47.017
Or did you rediscover it?

33:47.098 --> 33:47.999
No, no, it wasn't me.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.024
It was rediscovered, I think, really by feminism.

33:50.044 --> 33:54.393
Because everyone is, every review, you look for the things in common.

33:54.514 --> 33:58.382
Everyone mentions, you know, why would they have to mention the show?

33:59.071 --> 34:04.138
It was a clever thing, I guess.

34:04.759 --> 34:08.564
Would you like dessert?

34:08.664 --> 34:09.145
Not me.

34:09.265 --> 34:11.448
I just might have some coffee.

34:11.848 --> 34:17.797
I'll have a coffee.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.320
It's okay.

34:20.789 --> 34:25.236
I don't know if we can call it the climax, but certainly a sort of resolution for the novel.

34:25.276 --> 34:34.530
Because as far as I can tell, Kate Chopin invented the walk into the drink in American literature, filmic, or otherwise.

34:35.271 --> 34:40.760
I can't think of another book that ends that way.

34:40.780 --> 34:44.966
Does it bother you that some reviewers give that away, or is that almost incidental to the novel?

34:45.327 --> 34:46.168
It bothers me a little.

34:47.049 --> 34:49.513
Because I don't think that that is so...

34:50.523 --> 34:51.244
prefigured?

34:51.284 --> 34:51.484
No.

34:51.745 --> 34:52.065
No.

34:52.265 --> 34:52.826
I really don't.

34:52.926 --> 34:53.106
No.

34:53.747 --> 34:57.191
I mean, it's always a possibility, but I think it surprised me.

34:57.211 --> 34:59.995
It comes out of, because when it happens, it comes out of nowhere.

35:00.075 --> 35:01.377
It seems to be going in a different direction.

35:01.397 --> 35:01.817
Right.

35:01.837 --> 35:04.601
So, yes, it does bother me that people give that away.

35:04.861 --> 35:05.462
I did all things.

35:05.622 --> 35:07.585
I cut it out of our review as a matter of fact.

35:07.605 --> 35:07.865
Good, good.

35:07.885 --> 35:09.067
I said, no, that shouldn't be in there.

35:09.827 --> 35:10.528
I really shouldn't.

35:10.689 --> 35:12.631
I mean, we owe this to the author.

35:12.991 --> 35:15.334
And they said, well, it's there.

35:15.395 --> 35:16.356
I said, no, it's not there.

35:16.616 --> 35:18.358
It surprised me, and I read a lot of books.

35:19.400 --> 35:19.720
And they said,

35:20.122 --> 35:28.354
Yeah, I mean, I tried very hard to make it, you know, to keep the element of surprise, and that was working in the face of, you know, expectation.

35:28.394 --> 35:37.286
It wasn't easy to make it, you know, so, to make it happen suddenly, and then feel the inevitability of it after the fact.

35:37.526 --> 35:44.196
So it does annoy the human reviewers, as, like Noah Adams on all things, the Senator gave it away, like, right away.

35:44.236 --> 35:47.000
Well, I think that's terrible, isn't it?

35:47.160 --> 35:47.260
Yeah.

35:48.303 --> 35:49.264
That's what I want to ask.

35:49.304 --> 35:51.346
Are the long friends an invention?

35:52.067 --> 35:57.412
Long friends are related to a woman I knew in London.

35:58.133 --> 36:03.939
She was otherwise completely lucid.

36:03.979 --> 36:15.911
She was quite lucid and not at all schizoid, except in that she had these hallucinations, which were female figures.

36:17.353 --> 36:17.533
Oh.

36:18.273 --> 36:27.988
tall, silent female figures, who would sometimes, I mean, it was very, very creepy.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.452
Was she frightened by them or was she comfortable with them?

36:31.173 --> 36:34.939
She found them disturbing, she said.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.502
She wasn't frightened of them.

36:37.323 --> 36:40.348
I asked her if she ever tried to talk to them.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.473
And she never did.

36:41.493 --> 36:45.817
I mean, she said, I would know when one would be in the room.

36:46.138 --> 36:49.461
Sometimes I'd go back to the flat, and they're there.

36:50.682 --> 36:51.663
And I've never forgotten.

36:51.703 --> 36:53.645
It's one of those things you never forget.

36:55.167 --> 36:59.151
And so that was really where I got that.

37:00.112 --> 37:07.399
And she really seemed, in other respects, as far as I know, she was totally losing.

37:07.868 --> 37:20.668
Do you see your body of work, which is now five or four, I think it's like four, every one, I mean, highly respected novels, as one piece of work?

37:21.009 --> 37:23.813
Obviously try to do different things with each one.

37:23.833 --> 37:25.536
It's hard to, yeah, I was doing different things.

37:25.636 --> 37:27.679
I never saw it as one piece.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.762
I mean, in a way, it's unifying.

37:30.203 --> 37:34.770
Back to my concerns as they've emerged over four novels.

37:35.122 --> 37:43.813
But I never intended it to be a continuous, a single entity.

37:43.854 --> 37:52.845
Well, I thought that this had your funniest lines.

37:52.865 --> 37:56.010
Maybe you don't remember the funny lines from the previous ones.

37:56.350 --> 37:57.411
Maybe I don't.

37:57.431 --> 38:00.876
I thought there were some very funny lines.

38:01.430 --> 38:05.276
Well, I enjoy myself with the dialogue.

38:06.237 --> 38:12.247
That kind of thing, when you get into it, it kind of builds up a momentum.

38:12.267 --> 38:13.789
And it's fun to write.

38:15.091 --> 38:16.072
And it belongs there.

38:16.092 --> 38:18.676
I mean, I think the book would be really rather bleak.

38:18.696 --> 38:19.758
I mean, really bleak.

38:19.798 --> 38:24.806
And I don't expect people to put my books down and be depressed.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.669
I expect them to feel so good.

38:27.610 --> 38:30.154
Not necessarily uplifted, however.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.280
This is highly uplifted, but, but...

38:32.446 --> 38:38.772
with the kind of feeling of good, you know, a good feeling that you get from something of quality.

38:38.792 --> 38:47.339
And also, you know, a little less lonely, a little more, you know, reflective in a good way.

38:47.359 --> 38:51.103
And I mean, I think the humor really has to be there to make that happen.

38:51.123 --> 38:59.190
You have one phrase, and I can't recall where I read it, but you described Leanne as a closely reasoned madness.

38:59.991 --> 39:02.453
Is that your phrase?

39:02.433 --> 39:04.175
Or is that somebody else's phrase?

39:04.195 --> 39:05.457
I have a quotation.

39:05.477 --> 39:08.400
I honestly can't remember whether that's my phrase.

39:08.420 --> 39:10.903
It sounds like me, but I'm not sure.

39:11.484 --> 39:12.385
It's interesting.

39:12.585 --> 39:13.827
Yeah, but it's apt.

39:13.847 --> 39:14.568
It is apt.

39:14.928 --> 39:19.814
Well, we've covered a lot of ground.

39:22.578 --> 39:27.664
Somebody suggested that the Dongan Lounge character is...

39:29.787 --> 39:36.154
It was suggested by you after the first novel, waiting for the second novel.

39:36.194 --> 39:40.899
I often have a character who's a writer in at my expense, you know.

39:42.140 --> 39:43.321
Yeah.

39:43.341 --> 39:46.244
But I needed to describe him with people's eyes like that.

39:46.264 --> 39:46.965
Yes, I really do.

39:46.985 --> 39:51.990
Well, that's her and Tripp.

39:52.010 --> 39:54.653
He just gets the wrong impression in Kyle.

39:54.673 --> 39:57.516
It's such an odious person.

39:57.968 --> 40:25.242
Well, I'm not a strict realist.

40:25.525 --> 40:40.105
will take liberties with reality, because, you know, I don't believe in a single static reality.

40:40.125 --> 40:55.245
But I've certainly based myself on the real world, and I don't think there's anything in this particular book that is really out of the question, or couldn't have happened.

40:55.478 --> 41:22.701
maybe the scene on the mountain is a little wild yeah the scene on the mountain is a little wild but i'm you know uh that too has its roots in a real thing uh really so uh that's a frightening scene yeah oh yeah that's that's really where i mean he's really about to come under her power there

41:23.035 --> 41:47.698
I remember somebody telling me about their spouse who would grab them by the ear in bed and talk into their ear just sort of endlessly.

41:47.818 --> 41:51.962
Under this power, you know, schizophrenics can be tremendously charismatic.

41:52.600 --> 42:01.531
In a way, he's getting more and more tired, and she's kind of drawing him under.

42:02.713 --> 42:04.895
He's coming under the power of his net.

42:05.076 --> 42:12.425
You have your ocean imagery again there.

42:12.445 --> 42:15.929
The ocean really does figure it out.

42:16.229 --> 42:17.351
It's really true.

42:17.571 --> 42:18.372
It's quite true.

42:18.706 --> 42:36.040
But I was thinking in that scene, I was thinking of the scene where Diana, who is bathing, and Hippolytus,

42:37.370 --> 42:39.572
comes up and sees her naked.

42:39.653 --> 42:40.093
Okay.

42:40.674 --> 42:44.017
But this is the scene in mythology that I was thinking of.

42:47.822 --> 42:53.628
There is a scene, I can't remember the name of the hunter or even, I think it's... Diana was the hunter.

42:53.648 --> 42:58.894
But there's a young man hunting.

42:58.914 --> 43:01.537
He comes on Diana bathing naked.

43:02.698 --> 43:06.803
And she throws water from the lake that she's bathing in.

43:07.019 --> 43:07.460
at him.

43:07.880 --> 43:12.166
His name, I can almost think of it.

43:14.289 --> 43:16.953
And the water strikes him blind.

43:16.973 --> 43:18.415
He's come on something.

43:18.475 --> 43:19.656
It's a famous myth.

43:19.757 --> 43:22.040
It's a very famous myth.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.301
He's blinded.

43:24.523 --> 43:31.633
He sees Diana bathing naked and is blind.

43:31.733 --> 43:36.840
And then torn to pieces by his, or in some versions turned into a stag.

43:37.158 --> 43:39.981
and torn to pieces by a seven-year-old.

43:40.001 --> 43:43.685
And in some, just blondie.

43:43.705 --> 43:44.726
It is a famous film.

43:44.987 --> 43:46.268
And that was on my mind.

43:46.308 --> 43:47.670
It was on my mind.

43:49.051 --> 43:55.939
Where he sees her, what she thinks of as her secret art.

43:56.159 --> 44:00.604
And having seen that, he really can't live.

44:00.624 --> 44:05.730
My review, that was the one scene that describes it the most.

44:06.098 --> 44:13.766
But it's not a shrine, it's just a movie.

44:13.846 --> 44:14.687
It's a movie set.

44:14.707 --> 44:24.097
It's a movie set if you like, if you want it's the movie, it's the shack they built to the whole stop there and on the top of the mountain.

44:24.117 --> 44:26.659
I mean that's what I was thinking of.

44:26.679 --> 44:29.182
So you bring your own baggage to these things.

44:29.202 --> 44:32.565
I mean it isn't really a shrine.

44:33.446 --> 44:34.047
It's not really.

44:35.613 --> 44:36.917
I'm going to shut this up.

44:36.938 --> 44:37.793
I think he's going to play.
