WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:12.181
I bought one of those, Olympic or Olympia, and the damn thing has never worked, and I spent over $200 off the cabins.

00:12.201 --> 00:15.566
This is my third one, and I found them indestructible.

00:15.586 --> 00:16.227
Really?

00:17.529 --> 00:17.629
Yeah.

00:17.649 --> 00:19.131
I bought one at the London airport.

00:19.592 --> 00:21.314
That's where I bought one.

00:21.474 --> 00:22.296
Because it looks so nice.

00:22.316 --> 00:22.897
It is wonderful.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.500
It takes one battery, and it automatically reverses itself.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.523
You get three hours on it.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.645
erases itself, it's undependable.

00:30.685 --> 00:36.714
Well, that, what you have to do, what I just did, is put it on hold, because what happens is when you put it, I don't need to be very quick.

00:38.397 --> 00:40.701
Those things, you never again believe in it.

00:41.122 --> 00:42.904
However, if you trust it, fine.

00:43.686 --> 00:51.178
I don't know what Elizabeth told you, but this is Fitzgerald, this is Fitzgerald.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.882
Some of it,

00:55.634 --> 00:57.616
is of supreme value.

00:57.696 --> 00:59.058
Hemingway is there.

00:59.638 --> 01:11.311
Now, for example, the only set of the galleys of the unpublished Gatsby, Trimalchio.

01:14.534 --> 01:14.955
There it is.

01:15.295 --> 01:16.937
Isn't that something?

01:16.957 --> 01:17.838
Trimalchio.

01:17.858 --> 01:18.198
Wow.

01:18.899 --> 01:21.962
And when the show read it,

01:23.512 --> 01:33.481
He then took the other set, or his set, cut them up, marked them up, pasted, patched them, glued on inserts, and made The Great Gatsby.

01:34.282 --> 01:42.710
This is Trimalchio, the first and presumably finished version of The Great Gatsby that was never published.

01:43.110 --> 01:43.431
Wow.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.653
And I always like to show this.

01:50.137 --> 01:51.358
I went with John Cohn.

01:54.612 --> 01:57.436
Seven Gabriel books, $2,860.

01:57.456 --> 01:58.938
That includes 10% for John.

01:59.899 --> 02:01.000
That's a steal even then.

02:01.161 --> 02:02.583
That's a steal 33 years ago.

02:02.623 --> 02:06.928
Yeah, roughly I paid $2,500 in 1971.

02:07.109 --> 02:09.632
It's got to be worth a quarter of a million.

02:09.892 --> 02:18.624
Well, how can you... Was this because they were being nice to you, or do you think it was... It was an auction.

02:19.024 --> 02:19.645
It was an auction?

02:19.785 --> 02:20.026
Yes.

02:20.326 --> 02:21.087
This was an auction?

02:21.167 --> 02:23.270
Yeah.

02:23.290 --> 02:23.370
Wow.

02:23.789 --> 02:27.795
How does something like that slip through the cracks, or was his reputation that's set?

02:27.815 --> 02:27.875
No.

02:28.455 --> 02:34.023
In those days, collectors still didn't understand about galley proofs.

02:34.043 --> 02:36.987
And two things happened the day of the sale.

02:37.828 --> 02:51.467
One is the blind book collector that Arlen mentioned last night, Bob Samsel, said that he was planning to bid.

02:52.038 --> 03:03.551
$5,000, and he knew that I wanted it, and so therefore he would lend me for up to $5,000 if I needed it.

03:04.152 --> 03:16.126
And the other one was a phone call from Mel Edelstein, collector of modern poetry, librarian, who said, I hear you're bidding on those galley proofs.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.107
Have you gone crazy?

03:18.308 --> 03:18.889
Oh, really?

03:19.595 --> 03:26.841
At that time, 1971, collectors were still high spot collectors.

03:26.861 --> 03:28.703
Well, maybe he was trying to scare you off, you think?

03:28.723 --> 03:29.324
No, no.

03:29.344 --> 03:30.385
He thought you were crazy.

03:30.665 --> 03:31.566
Yeah, he thought I was crazy.

03:33.007 --> 03:35.269
At that time, collectors wanted high spots.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.212
They didn't understand about the value of proofs.

03:39.873 --> 03:43.116
So as a scholar, what does something like this give you?

03:44.117 --> 03:48.741
It gives me and my students a chance to see how a genius

03:49.092 --> 03:53.957
took something that was brilliant to begin with and turned it into a masterpiece.

03:54.357 --> 03:58.501
And you can actually track that from one state to the next?

03:58.521 --> 03:58.641
Yeah.

03:58.661 --> 04:17.599
I've taught one course in which each student had a copy of the published Gatsby, and I read the galley version aloud, and we stopped, and we argued about all important revisions.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.660
And you were able

04:19.113 --> 04:22.377
to really discuss the creative process one, one stay tuned.

04:22.397 --> 04:24.820
Well, this, I'm jumping, I'm getting ahead.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.402
That's fine, but it's okay, I'd like to jump around.

04:26.422 --> 04:42.741
I want to show you what I regard as the greatest teaching tool ever invented, but people keep moving it.

04:45.556 --> 04:52.846
Bear with me for a moment, because this makes the point better.

05:05.444 --> 05:06.146
This isn't bad.

05:06.506 --> 05:07.988
You hang on to that, I'll come back to you.

05:08.048 --> 05:12.795
As a matter of fact, it's more than not bad.

05:13.231 --> 05:17.857
I'll read F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Offshore Pirate, TypeScript, 1920.

05:18.919 --> 05:24.406
Last page, number 38 of TypeScript, a short story published in the post, with revised conclusion.

05:24.426 --> 05:25.107
We'll come to it.

05:25.368 --> 05:28.712
Okay, I'm just saying that for the benefit of my machine and what I'm holding.

05:29.794 --> 05:35.301
But the great item, I swear the thing has legs.

05:35.381 --> 05:36.583
It walks all over the vault.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.766
It's never in the same place twice.

05:43.522 --> 05:47.307
See, when I saw that canceled check, I saw seven-year-old, so I thought you were buying it from a bookseller.

05:47.327 --> 05:47.507
No, no.

05:47.527 --> 05:47.888
That's why.

05:47.908 --> 05:50.171
I didn't realize that was an open warfare there.

05:50.371 --> 05:51.833
John went to bid for me.

05:52.454 --> 05:53.215
But he was your agent.

05:54.056 --> 06:04.150
And John couldn't believe in the prices that Modern Firsts were bringing.

06:04.430 --> 06:09.377
I remember his outrage when Catcher in the Rye in Dust Jacket bought $30.

06:10.278 --> 06:12.381
He said this was ruining the book business.

06:12.547 --> 06:13.729
So I didn't trust John.

06:14.870 --> 06:22.081
I wanted him to bid, but I knew he was perfectly capable of stopping what he thought the price was absurdly high.

06:22.942 --> 06:27.910
So I went and sat next to him and kept elbowing him to keep him going.

06:29.372 --> 06:33.738
I'm surprised somebody like Will Feldman didn't buy that for Harry Ransom at 71.

06:33.899 --> 06:41.710
That would have been during his—they really fell down on that, luckily for you.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.883
You sound as though I shouldn't have gotten it.

06:44.903 --> 06:46.004
No, no, I'm thrilled that you got it.

06:46.024 --> 06:49.688
I'm just, no, I'm delighted that you were able to steal it, basically.

06:49.889 --> 06:59.280
So I'm marveling at the apparent stupidity of your rivals for not recognizing the value of the object, the artifact.

06:59.300 --> 07:04.746
Well, I said, people still didn't feel comfortable buying galley proofs.

07:06.007 --> 07:09.992
And of course, the one I'm looking for is not here.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.213
because I missed it.

07:16.534 --> 07:17.895
However, oh, oh, oh, oh.

07:17.935 --> 07:18.416
There it is.

07:19.136 --> 07:25.963
Well, this is the passports.

07:25.983 --> 07:26.623
Oh, they'll have it.

07:26.643 --> 07:27.804
Well, you're going to have to find it.

07:27.844 --> 07:29.666
You're going to fret about it all day.

07:29.706 --> 07:32.108
No, I just went past it because I was talking.

07:32.488 --> 07:33.149
But this will do.

07:33.229 --> 07:33.529
OK.

07:34.190 --> 07:43.118
One of Fitzgerald's most pleasing early stories

07:43.891 --> 07:56.488
during that period when he was appearing in the Sad Evening Post in the year 1920, almost every other week, was Offshore Pirate.

07:57.769 --> 08:11.147
And as you know, it's a fantasy story, an imaginative story about a young man who wins

08:11.532 --> 08:18.478
an unobtainable, strong-willed girl by staging this elaborate act of piracy.

08:19.920 --> 08:30.169
And here's the typescript, which ends with the explanation that it was all a dream.

08:30.269 --> 08:31.050
It never happened.

08:31.851 --> 08:32.231
Corny.

08:32.851 --> 08:33.192
Bad.

08:34.353 --> 08:38.957
And in proof, he... I'm sorry to say bad.

08:39.325 --> 08:41.007
But a dream ending is always corny.

08:41.167 --> 08:44.210
Anybody can have a dream ending.

08:44.430 --> 08:45.251
And it was all a dream.

08:45.311 --> 08:46.031
It never happened.

08:46.792 --> 08:47.713
And then he rewrote it.

08:48.594 --> 08:49.675
And this is the original?

08:49.695 --> 08:50.676
No, this is the original.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.957
This is the rejected version.

08:52.898 --> 08:59.844
And the published story was real.

08:59.884 --> 09:00.565
It really happened.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.147
This man did.

09:02.187 --> 09:03.488
They changed the story entirely.

09:03.508 --> 09:03.848
He did.

09:03.908 --> 09:04.329
Not they.

09:04.509 --> 09:04.809
He.

09:04.829 --> 09:05.049
They.

09:05.069 --> 09:05.230
He.

09:06.190 --> 09:06.931
You said rejected.

09:06.971 --> 09:07.732
Rejected by him.

09:07.872 --> 09:08.092
Yes.

09:08.272 --> 09:08.453
OK.

09:08.533 --> 09:08.893
I'm sorry.

09:09.042 --> 09:20.792
And the published story takes the action as real.

09:21.753 --> 09:35.505
He did stage a piracy, but the published story ends with the line, she kissed him in the illustration.

09:36.686 --> 09:38.948
One of the best sentences Fitzgerald ever wrote.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.407
because he's having it at least two ways at once.

09:45.510 --> 09:51.179
He's saying, this really happened, but he's also saying, look, it's just a story.

09:51.981 --> 09:53.904
She kissed him in the illustration.

09:55.386 --> 10:01.476
And you say that's a great teaching tool because it demonstrates for your students.

10:02.958 --> 10:03.979
Yes, sir.

10:04.340 --> 10:07.023
I don't have a question.

10:07.304 --> 10:08.405
I want you to say it.

10:08.425 --> 10:09.346
All right.

10:09.527 --> 10:21.002
What it seems to be for the students is how authors, in flashes of inspiration, return to a presumably finished work.

10:22.263 --> 10:24.927
And where the first is probably still the best.

10:24.947 --> 10:25.708
And make it better.

10:27.511 --> 10:28.813
I'm sorry about this.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.154
It really bothers me.

10:30.294 --> 10:30.595
I know.

10:31.035 --> 10:32.917
And it's going to bother you all day until you find it.

10:32.937 --> 10:33.298
I know it.

10:33.318 --> 10:34.319
We'll talk about other things.

10:34.699 --> 10:36.742
Here is an unpublished Fitzgerald story.

10:37.683 --> 10:41.467
This was a story he wrote in 1920.

10:42.148 --> 10:43.249
Question mark.

10:43.309 --> 10:43.770
The title.

10:43.790 --> 10:44.531
No, it's 1920.

10:44.871 --> 10:46.513
He probably wrote it in Westport, Connecticut.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.236
The Couple, is that the title?

10:49.296 --> 10:49.657
Yes.

10:50.057 --> 10:54.042
And Fitzgerald didn't think it was worth publishing.

10:54.410 --> 10:55.892
and he never attempted to sell it.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.817
And so what do you think, having read it multiple times, I'm sure?

10:59.418 --> 11:00.159
It's a bad story.

11:00.179 --> 11:00.880
It's a bad story.

11:00.940 --> 11:03.284
His judgment was right.

11:03.304 --> 11:03.404
Yeah.

11:03.424 --> 11:11.156
And I have made no attempt to publish it, although I don't control the rights, of course, but it would be possible to obtain publication rights.

11:12.058 --> 11:12.438
Here.

11:15.203 --> 11:16.605
Maybe the best book in the vault.

11:17.667 --> 11:21.733
The first of Ulysses unfortunately rebound, but the Paris Ulysses

11:22.169 --> 11:45.072
with a letter from james joyce dear mr fitzgerald here with is the book you gave me you gave me signed and and i am doing adding adding a portrait of the artist as a once young man wow with the thanks of your much obliged but much

11:45.507 --> 11:48.871
pusillanimous friend, James Joyce.

11:49.111 --> 11:49.352
Wow.

11:49.512 --> 11:50.653
And it's dated 11... 1928.

11:50.673 --> 11:52.095
...7, 1928.

11:52.255 --> 11:56.120
And it's even got his return address up there.

11:56.781 --> 11:58.643
And... ...on stationery.

11:59.244 --> 12:01.707
The copy also has Fitzgerald's annotations.

12:02.908 --> 12:15.143
In the section which is written as a series of parodies of British authors by James Joyce, Fitzgerald attempted to identify

12:15.747 --> 12:17.268
the subject of each parody.

12:17.769 --> 12:23.174
Now, can you comprehend Fitzgerald's reading of this?

12:23.194 --> 12:28.198
I mean, can you see whether or not this book is having any kind of an impact on him as a reader?

12:28.919 --> 12:29.760
None whatsoever.

12:29.820 --> 12:31.281
As a writer, yes.

12:31.782 --> 12:32.482
As a writer, no.

12:33.243 --> 12:35.545
Fitzgerald did not try to imitate James Joyce.

12:36.886 --> 12:43.933
By the time Ulysses was published, 1922, Fitzgerald's style, Fitzgerald's technique was formed.

12:44.173 --> 12:45.214
Have you ever tried to?

12:45.548 --> 12:46.570
Let me finish the story.

12:47.090 --> 12:52.018
That says, I'm going to, thank you for asking me to inscribe Ulysses.

12:52.459 --> 12:55.644
I'm going to throw in Portrait of an Artist, right?

12:56.746 --> 12:58.048
There's the copy he threw in.

12:58.849 --> 13:03.997
To Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, Paris, 11-7-8, 19-28.

13:04.498 --> 13:07.323
Can you imagine the odds against matching up?

13:08.164 --> 13:10.408
And you acquired these separately?

13:10.428 --> 13:10.628
Thank you.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.651
Well, that's brilliant.

13:12.971 --> 13:13.692
That's wonderful.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.957
Which did you get first?

13:16.977 --> 13:17.197
That.

13:17.317 --> 13:20.361
And so then were you on the hunt for the numbers?

13:20.562 --> 13:25.529
Yeah, then I knew what to look for.

13:26.430 --> 13:34.200
For whom the bell tolls, to Scott with affection and esteem, earnest for whom the bell tolls.

13:34.621 --> 13:36.444
And in remarkably nice condition, too.

13:36.464 --> 13:38.326
He kept it in pretty decent condition, didn't he?

13:39.247 --> 13:40.429
Do you think he read that copy?

13:40.662 --> 13:41.223
Yeah.

13:41.243 --> 13:41.783
That copy?

13:42.484 --> 13:42.584
Yeah.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.166
I think that's the copy that Fitzgerald read.

13:44.206 --> 13:46.769
Unfortunately, Fitzgerald was not a scribbler.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.312
He didn't make notes in the margins.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.754
And you say, unfortunately, which I agree with.

13:51.834 --> 13:56.219
I mean, the obtuse collector would say, we don't want anybody fooling around.

13:56.379 --> 13:57.040
It would teach us.

13:57.280 --> 13:57.881
It would teach us.

13:57.961 --> 13:58.562
It would teach us.

13:58.622 --> 14:01.825
It would tell us what Fitzgerald looked for.

14:03.047 --> 14:07.952
Do you have a sense of Fitzgerald as a reader?

14:09.333 --> 14:14.738
Fitzgerald was a sensitive, intelligent critic.

14:16.340 --> 14:24.248
And the image of Fitzgerald as simply very facile is misleading and destructive.

14:26.110 --> 14:35.860
The man who wrote The Great Gatsby, the man who wrote Tender is the Night, was a man with delicate literary sensibility.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.323
Now, here, this is the best teaching

14:39.691 --> 14:40.812
machine I've ever seen.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.176
And it's a sheet of paper that you're holding?

14:43.196 --> 14:48.122
In 1929, Fitzgerald wrote a side-needing post story called The Swimmers.

14:49.524 --> 14:51.387
It starts off brilliantly.

14:51.427 --> 14:58.696
It has intimate connections with Tender is the Night, but it ends up with a trick ending, unfortunately.

14:59.237 --> 15:09.090
But it was Fitzgerald's custom to end a story with

15:09.340 --> 15:24.476
a philosophical meditation, usually written in a meditative, brooding style.

15:25.337 --> 15:32.445
And here is a story in which Fitzgerald wrote the ending.

15:33.522 --> 15:36.125
I'm sorry, in longhand, right?

15:36.446 --> 15:37.227
No, it's typed.

15:37.247 --> 15:38.568
Oh, I was looking down here.

15:38.628 --> 15:39.309
Okay, this is typed.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.250
You're going to let me do it?

15:40.391 --> 15:40.891
No, no.

15:40.911 --> 15:42.573
It's my collection, goddammit.

15:42.633 --> 15:43.154
I love this.

15:43.174 --> 15:43.474
Go ahead.

15:43.494 --> 15:44.335
I'm sorry.

15:44.396 --> 15:46.138
I'm sorry.

15:46.158 --> 15:46.899
I apologize.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.200
I apologize.

15:50.203 --> 15:55.369
The typescript, and Fitzgerald never typed, by the way.

15:56.090 --> 16:00.476
He would have his manuscript, he wrote in pencil, on paper, the way God intended.

16:01.277 --> 16:03.259
He would have the secretary's

16:03.661 --> 16:23.566
type the thing triple-spaced, and then he would go over the typescript once, twice, three times if necessary, having the secretary retype it every time until he got it the way he wanted, even for the much maligned, the much misunderstood Saturday Evening Post stories.

16:25.489 --> 16:32.217
As Gerald writes, it's a story about the meaning, it's a story that contrasts America with Europe.

16:32.973 --> 16:34.455
Better than Henry James ever did.

16:35.897 --> 16:40.985
So at the end of the story, Fitzgerald is summarizing his feelings about America.

16:41.646 --> 16:42.728
France was a land.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.350
England a people.

16:44.891 --> 16:47.095
Was a people.

16:47.115 --> 16:47.756
Oh, sorry.

16:47.776 --> 16:48.236
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:48.336 --> 16:48.557
Okay.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.740
I shouldn't be reading over your shoulder.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.101
Go ahead.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.805
You know, you'd have a lot of trouble getting through one of my courses.

16:53.965 --> 16:54.566
I would.

16:54.586 --> 16:55.507
Maybe I'll get too excited.

16:55.888 --> 16:56.909
France was a land.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.392
The typescript reads.

16:58.592 --> 16:59.233
Typescript.

16:59.365 --> 17:00.607
England was a people.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.430
No, England a people.

17:02.590 --> 17:04.032
I'm reading from the typescript.

17:04.693 --> 17:05.495
England a people.

17:06.757 --> 17:07.057
Yes.

17:07.197 --> 17:09.541
Sorry, I have a silly scheduling question to ask you.

17:10.803 --> 17:14.489
They're going to have books at the dinner for you to sign.

17:14.549 --> 17:14.990
Happily.

17:15.330 --> 17:15.691
Happily.

17:16.172 --> 17:20.238
And there's some time beforehand during the reception.

17:20.619 --> 17:23.223
They can also make time at the end of the dinner.

17:23.283 --> 17:24.665
Whenever is appropriate.

17:24.785 --> 17:25.366
It's fine with me.

17:26.588 --> 17:26.688
Okay.

17:26.708 --> 17:26.888
Okay.

17:26.909 --> 17:27.209
Thank you.

17:27.229 --> 17:27.870
Once again.

17:29.403 --> 17:36.774
The typescript reads, France was a land, England are people, but America was the grave's hat.

17:36.794 --> 17:40.339
And he leaves a blank because he doesn't know what battle he wants.

17:41.541 --> 17:45.327
And the tired, drawn, nervous faces of its great men.

17:46.709 --> 17:55.782
And the country boys dying in the Argonne for a phrase that was empty before their body withered.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.292
It was a willingness of the heart.

17:58.513 --> 17:59.033
This is wonderful.

17:59.053 --> 18:02.398
Now that is brilliant and moving and even profound.

18:03.319 --> 18:12.831
Then he takes his pencil and he takes something that any writer would give, at least one hand to be able to write.

18:13.392 --> 18:21.483
Then he takes his pencil and he converts something brilliant into something... A masterpiece, maybe?

18:22.544 --> 18:23.305
Unexcelled.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.284
masterpiece.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.325
Why not?

18:25.345 --> 18:33.475
I am now going to read the revised version with Fitzgerald's handwritten inserts, revisions, improvements.

18:34.637 --> 18:35.698
France was a land.

18:36.639 --> 18:37.981
England was a people.

18:38.822 --> 18:48.354
Fitzgerald always heard his prose, and he always revised not just for sense, but for rhythm.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.638
England was a people, but America

18:53.879 --> 19:02.488
And then he inserts, having about it, still, that quality of the idea was harder to utter.

19:03.369 --> 19:03.809
It was.

19:04.510 --> 19:21.507
The grave's at, and he gets the battle, Shiloh, and the tired, drawn, nervous faces of his great men, and he takes a rather choppy series of sentences, and he links them up, and

19:22.887 --> 19:28.053
The country boys dying in the Argonne for a phrase that was empty before their bodies withered.

19:28.774 --> 19:30.176
It was a willingness of the heart.

19:30.957 --> 19:36.143
And I Xeroxed this up and I pass it out to the students, every course.

19:37.124 --> 19:50.059
And being the kind of person I am, I say, if this doesn't make it clear to you how Fitzgerald's art operated, please find another course.

19:51.862 --> 19:54.865
The first time I saw this, it was an obscure story.

19:55.626 --> 19:57.468
Fitzgerald never collected it in his lifetime.

19:57.588 --> 20:03.115
Even for me, the insertion of a semicolon, for instance, you're talking about the rhythms of the writing.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.496
This was one paragraph.

20:04.516 --> 20:08.881
He's now not only connected the paragraphs, but he continues it as a sentence.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.265
It's breath-taking for me, really, it is.

20:12.465 --> 20:21.295
Now, the story was never collected by Fitzgerald, and the first time I read it,

20:22.253 --> 20:25.437
was when I read John Gunther's USA.

20:26.097 --> 20:30.963
And that paragraph is the epigraph in USA.

20:32.024 --> 20:35.748
And it didn't say F. Scott Fitzgerald the Swimmers.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.711
It said F. Scott Fitzgerald.

20:37.731 --> 20:39.392
It's maddening when they do that.

20:39.412 --> 20:44.398
It took me months of going through old Saturday evening posts on microfilm.

20:44.678 --> 20:45.519
Why do they do that?

20:45.539 --> 20:48.323
See, they don't have to identify in the epigraph, and it drives me nuts.

20:48.343 --> 20:51.366
They should identify in the epigraph.

20:52.865 --> 20:53.586
That's wonderful.

20:53.726 --> 20:56.530
That's Fitzgerald's briefcase.

20:56.930 --> 20:57.351
Oh, really?

20:57.851 --> 20:59.373
I've got to give a touch to that.

20:59.414 --> 21:02.758
This is the briefcase that Fitzgerald had in Hollywood.

21:03.619 --> 21:10.488
Well, you'll notice the gold stamping says, Scott Fitzgerald, 597 Fifth Avenue.

21:10.808 --> 21:11.810
That's the Scribner Building.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.872
Of course, Fitzgerald didn't have a home.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.416
Fitzgerald's home was the Scribner Building.

21:16.436 --> 21:17.397
That is very telling, isn't it?

21:17.898 --> 21:18.919
It really is very telling.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.302
Now, there's a good story with this.

21:21.721 --> 21:29.914
This came up at an auction in New York at which the star item was a piece of pickled Columbus.

21:31.015 --> 21:31.937
They would do that.

21:31.977 --> 21:38.026
You know, when a great person died, they'd hack off a hunk of the body and preserve it.

21:38.967 --> 21:41.652
And the great item was a piece of pickled Columbus.

21:43.054 --> 21:44.035
Purportedly so.

21:44.656 --> 21:47.981
And I happened to be in New York.

21:48.061 --> 21:49.804
I didn't go off especially.

21:50.273 --> 21:53.037
But maybe there are no accidents in book collecting.

21:53.938 --> 22:07.878
So I went by the auction house to watch the Fitzgerald sale, because I knew Fitzgerald's briefcase was in the same sale as Christopher Columbus.

22:07.898 --> 22:10.321
Is this what you were targeting, this item, or were the other items there?

22:10.362 --> 22:11.303
I just went to watch.

22:11.323 --> 22:12.084
You just went to watch.

22:12.104 --> 22:12.845
You were there for this.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.628
Yeah.

22:14.648 --> 22:17.732
Don't tell me you weren't.

22:19.855 --> 22:21.156
Columbus comes up first.

22:22.678 --> 22:31.126
There's one bidder, and the television cameras are there, and the reporters are there, because, you know, great things are expected.

22:31.186 --> 22:33.148
They're expecting fierce competition.

22:33.228 --> 22:33.889
They buy it in.

22:34.309 --> 22:42.397
And the television cameras were there, and the bidding, one bidder, and it went for around $5,000.

22:42.597 --> 22:43.077
So you got it.

22:43.097 --> 22:44.319
They didn't buy it in?

22:44.399 --> 22:44.579
No.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.781
It went for about $5,000.

22:46.821 --> 22:48.883
Then the briefcase came up.

22:49.572 --> 22:52.354
And I thought I was just watching.

22:52.394 --> 22:53.655
TV cameras still there?

22:54.076 --> 22:54.876
No.

22:54.896 --> 22:56.178
Yes, they were there, but they weren't running.

22:56.198 --> 22:56.978
But they weren't interested.

22:57.238 --> 22:58.099
No, they weren't interested.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.162
I thought I was just watching.

23:02.103 --> 23:11.771
But the high bidder, the person who looked as though he was going to be the winning bidder, was a collector I don't like.

23:12.892 --> 23:13.372
Was it?

23:13.912 --> 23:14.473
I won't say.

23:15.334 --> 23:16.475
Was a collector I don't like.

23:17.275 --> 23:18.716
A rival for Fitzgerald?

23:19.077 --> 23:19.377
No.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.469
Just an individual.

23:21.529 --> 23:21.769
Okay.

23:21.869 --> 23:22.210
Call it.

23:23.051 --> 23:29.722
And I found my right hand automatically going up, and I took it at ten.

23:32.286 --> 23:32.627
Ten what?

23:32.647 --> 23:33.348
A thousand.

23:33.508 --> 23:34.470
A thousand.

23:34.930 --> 23:35.511
Well, that's a lot.

23:35.531 --> 23:38.676
At which point the reporters came up, and they said, do you have a statement?

23:39.357 --> 23:40.099
And I said, yes.

23:40.740 --> 23:44.065
It's more important to write The Great Gatsby than to discover Puerto Rico.

23:44.669 --> 23:48.214
They said, my God, we can't use that.

23:50.416 --> 23:52.499
Now, I had a problem.

23:52.619 --> 23:55.182
I was sitting there with maybe $100 in my pocket.

23:55.723 --> 23:58.246
And as you know, you're supposed to settle up on the spot.

23:58.266 --> 24:02.412
So I went to the counter, and I said, I'll be back in two hours with $10,000.

24:03.693 --> 24:04.735
Right around Manhattan.

24:04.835 --> 24:05.636
Isn't that wonderful?

24:05.656 --> 24:06.617
Seeing all my friends.

24:06.657 --> 24:09.240
I got a thousand from one friend, and I got five.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.864
And I came back with $10,000 and borrowed money.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.265
About how long ago is this, Steve?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.507
Do you know our fans, roughly?

24:14.825 --> 24:15.506
Oh, Jesus.

24:17.148 --> 24:21.133
Frase was still alive, because Frase, uh, Fraser Clark, my partner.

24:21.754 --> 24:23.876
Fraser Clark was one of the people I borrowed money from.

24:23.936 --> 24:28.502
He was having lunch at the plaza.

24:28.522 --> 24:32.507
I interrupted his lunches and went, give me everything you've got.

24:32.527 --> 24:33.869
Help, help.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.871
Uh, had to be 20 years ago.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.993
20 years ago, okay.

24:37.073 --> 24:41.378
Yeah, because this is still just before this whole passion for the material artifacts.

24:41.398 --> 24:44.342
But what I like about it is that his address...

24:45.166 --> 24:45.947
It was 597.

24:46.127 --> 24:49.952
But it's all part of this persona that he was the Scott Fitzgerald.

24:51.333 --> 24:53.596
It's a Fifth Avenue address, and it's not his.

24:53.656 --> 24:54.637
What more do you need to say?

24:54.697 --> 24:55.198
It's wonderful.

24:55.438 --> 24:56.219
It's the Scribner building.

24:56.239 --> 24:57.520
It's the Scribner building.

24:57.541 --> 24:58.702
It's fabulous.

24:58.742 --> 24:59.243
That's great.

24:59.763 --> 25:00.604
That's a great story.

25:00.724 --> 25:03.067
Did you saw clearly you had a paddle number when you were there?

25:03.187 --> 25:04.268
You must have gone to register.

25:04.288 --> 25:05.029
You didn't need one?

25:05.089 --> 25:05.910
No, not in those days.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.133
You just walked in and you stuck up your hand.

25:08.193 --> 25:09.675
It's quite informal.

25:09.735 --> 25:10.736
Yeah, not anymore.

25:11.096 --> 25:11.717
The millionaire.

25:11.757 --> 25:12.618
Yeah, exactly.

25:12.919 --> 25:14.160
All right, I'd like to, oh.

25:14.410 --> 25:16.632
Zelda painting.

25:16.652 --> 25:20.316
We said last night that Arlen had given her Zelda collection.

25:20.336 --> 25:22.638
These are two of Arlen's Zelda paintings.

25:23.659 --> 25:27.563
Zelda painted more flowers than anything else.

25:30.646 --> 25:31.487
That's kind of nice.

25:32.488 --> 25:34.170
What do you make of them?

25:34.190 --> 25:36.793
Well, this one I like because it's not just signed.

25:36.913 --> 25:37.794
She rarely signed.

25:38.875 --> 25:43.219
It's signed, but I think the fact that the flowers are in a broken

25:43.418 --> 25:47.384
bowl has some significance.

25:47.404 --> 25:47.805
Indeed.

25:47.825 --> 25:48.385
Some meaning.

25:48.446 --> 25:50.148
Sure.

25:50.168 --> 25:51.951
Now, did she date it?

25:52.371 --> 25:54.274
We don't know.

25:54.294 --> 25:54.354
No.

25:54.374 --> 26:09.978
No, but I bought it in Nashville, North Carolina, so it's a good supposition that it was done while she was a patient at the— And, of course, the scene would fit, wouldn't it, the broken bowl?

26:10.078 --> 26:11.400
At the sanitarium.

26:12.663 --> 26:14.225
This is exciting.

26:14.265 --> 26:16.968
These are the treasures.

26:17.870 --> 26:20.513
But the showroom is more fun.

26:23.196 --> 26:24.918
How could anything be more fun than the other?

26:25.159 --> 26:26.020
What do you see?

26:27.582 --> 26:28.202
What do you see?

26:28.523 --> 26:32.788
You never lose your passion for this, do you?

26:32.808 --> 26:38.215
For as long as you've been hunting it, it just seems to give you a charge every time you pick it up.

26:41.249 --> 26:42.230
How do you explain that?

26:42.250 --> 26:43.692
How do you try to?

26:44.854 --> 26:56.409
You know, you never become... I'll give you an answer, which is... I can't understand the people who aren't always excited about what they do.

26:58.472 --> 26:58.933
Okay.

27:01.055 --> 27:06.042
If you're not doing what excites you, then you damn well better find something else that does excite you.

27:09.413 --> 27:10.894
So for you, what comes first?

27:10.934 --> 27:14.377
The scholar, the collecting, the publishing?

27:14.417 --> 27:15.178
I mean first.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.619
Don't worry about it.

27:16.639 --> 27:17.500
Did I do that?

27:17.520 --> 27:21.003
No, the floor was badly built.

27:22.044 --> 27:23.045
Has that happened before?

27:23.085 --> 27:23.665
Oh, every day.

27:29.050 --> 27:29.891
What comes first?

27:30.671 --> 27:31.152
The book.

27:32.173 --> 27:34.615
If I'm asked to describe myself, I'm a bookman.

27:35.536 --> 27:38.458
Everything I do, everything I write, everything I buy,

27:38.978 --> 27:52.336
has to do with the role of the book in American culture, and beyond that, the profession of authorship.

27:53.177 --> 28:06.454
I think most of the teaching of literature is terribly flawed because the author

28:07.835 --> 28:09.557
is ignored.

28:13.060 --> 28:22.149
With all of this nonsense about postmodernism, all of this nonsense about, they actually say, the author is dead.

28:23.170 --> 28:34.221
All of this nonsense about pure criticism injures the work, certainly injures the students.

28:35.503 --> 28:37.825
And my collections

28:38.564 --> 28:42.568
And I formed, what, maybe 15 major collections?

28:42.588 --> 28:43.869
Major, major collections.

28:43.889 --> 28:56.781
My collections always have the rationale of documenting the profession of authorship in the case of this author.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.304
And this is what this room does.

28:59.644 --> 29:03.588
When we built the room, we assumed that it was adequate.

29:05.049 --> 29:08.352
Within a month, it was inadequate.

29:08.703 --> 29:13.328
There is almost half as much again back in the rare book stacks.

29:13.889 --> 29:20.076
When we get the new building, I am going to fight mightily to get a room big enough to hold all the Fitzgerald.

29:20.537 --> 29:26.204
In general, this wall is books by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

29:27.865 --> 29:38.558
The handle is, the goal is, every printing of every edition of every book by F. Scott Fitzgerald in the English language.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.330
And I've damn near done it.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.273
Damn near done it.

29:43.293 --> 29:44.375
Paperback, everything.

29:44.435 --> 29:48.041
That wall is the about wall.

29:49.684 --> 29:55.233
Fitzgerald's Friends, Paris in the 20s, the House of Scribner, Maxwell Perkins.

29:56.515 --> 30:04.668
I had started a Hemingway collection, but when we bought the great Hemingway collection, it was foolish for me to compete with my own collection, so to speak.

30:04.688 --> 30:05.710
So that's the

30:06.382 --> 30:12.008
So those are like the C, D, and E items, whatever they... That's the odds and ends of Hemingway.

30:12.328 --> 30:14.810
But there's Edmund Wilson, there's Bud Showberg.

30:15.251 --> 30:18.254
I'm working very hard to build a Bud Showberg collection.

30:18.614 --> 30:27.242
There's Don Ogden Stewart, who I think is the funniest American humorist of the 20s and now completely forgotten, unknown.

30:27.963 --> 30:29.284
There's Donald Ogden Stewart.

30:29.945 --> 30:31.106
I mentioned Edmund Wilson.

30:31.607 --> 30:32.568
There's Ring Lordner.

30:32.628 --> 30:34.009
They're all the people

30:34.394 --> 30:38.379
Fitzgerald was close to in a professional or literary way.

30:38.559 --> 30:39.400
I get it.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.942
At the top are translations.

30:41.703 --> 30:44.726
I don't like them.

30:44.746 --> 30:47.810
But when they're offered to me, I buy them.

30:47.830 --> 30:52.836
But my feeling is if God wanted them to read Fitzgerald, he would have made them Americans or Englishmen.

30:54.118 --> 30:56.200
How the hell can you translate The Great Gatsby?

30:56.602 --> 31:01.229
Well, but he certainly resonates with readers outside of the United States.

31:01.509 --> 31:02.010
I don't think so.

31:02.030 --> 31:02.771
You don't think so?

31:02.831 --> 31:04.253
I don't think so.

31:04.334 --> 31:07.438
So you think he's a uniquely an American phenomenon?

31:07.759 --> 31:12.286
I don't think any great author's style translates.

31:14.749 --> 31:18.775
I think all translations are glorified master plots or Cliff's notes.

31:19.677 --> 31:20.618
I don't see how the hell.

31:21.273 --> 31:25.698
So that excludes Dante from our cork horses, then?

31:26.159 --> 31:28.622
No, it doesn't exclude, but you ought to know what you're reading.

31:29.423 --> 31:31.906
You're not reading Dante.

31:31.926 --> 31:35.411
You're reading Dante rewritten by somebody else in another language.

31:35.431 --> 31:39.796
Which is why Blake taught himself all these languages, so he could read them in the original.

31:39.816 --> 31:40.076
I think so.

31:40.156 --> 31:49.508
Now, my favorite spot in the room is, watch, from here to here,

31:50.011 --> 31:52.114
Okay, maybe 12 linear feet, let's say.

31:52.134 --> 31:59.904
And from here to here, every one of those books is inscribed by or to Fitzgerald.

31:59.924 --> 32:05.231
Every one of those books Fitzgerald held and may have read.

32:05.271 --> 32:14.143
There are more books inscribed by Fitzgerald on these shelves than any place else in the world.

32:16.787 --> 32:16.927
And.

32:17.688 --> 32:17.908
And.

32:18.243 --> 32:28.613
So there has to be a couple of favorites here that they're really... How about I show you a favorite?

32:28.633 --> 32:28.993
No, that's not it.

32:31.476 --> 32:33.798
This favorite, yeah.

32:33.818 --> 32:39.323
When The Great Gatsby was published, Fitzgerald was in Paris.

32:39.924 --> 32:44.588
Actually, he was in France on his way to Paris, so he couldn't sign copies of the book.

32:45.175 --> 32:55.209
Instead, he wrote inscriptions on slips of paper, sent them to Maxwell Perkins, and told Perkins to paste these in the books.

32:55.689 --> 32:59.314
Here is the copy that went to Van White Brooks.

33:00.416 --> 33:00.977
Wow.

33:00.997 --> 33:10.810
Now, and he mentions reading Van White Brooks.

33:11.691 --> 33:12.853
And he says, what?

33:13.171 --> 33:28.665
I've taken the liberty of sending you this after having run across a copy of America's Coming of Age, a Brooks book, in a bookstore here, and bought it and read it with enormous pleasure.

33:29.146 --> 33:31.288
Capri, actually, Italy.

33:31.308 --> 33:34.891
You hadn't even gotten to France yet, F. Scott Fitzgerald.

33:35.492 --> 33:37.614
Now, that's nice.

33:38.835 --> 33:39.816
It's very nice.

33:39.916 --> 33:42.418
It gets better.

33:44.913 --> 33:55.965
Because here is Fitzgerald's copy of Van White Brooks's Ordeal of Mark Twain.

33:56.846 --> 34:01.792
So I'm putting together the connections between Fitzgerald and Van White Brooks.

34:06.798 --> 34:08.119
Brooks reciprocates.

34:08.555 --> 34:09.917
by sending Fitzgerald.

34:09.937 --> 34:13.883
Yeah, I'm just checking the years on it, so they're following in pretty close order, yeah.

34:14.163 --> 34:19.712
Brooks reciprocates by sending Fitzgerald an inscribed copy of his Henry James book.

34:21.154 --> 34:24.719
Now, do these fellows know each other, or is it strictly a correspondence kind of?

34:24.799 --> 34:25.661
Strictly a correspondence.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.907
They had— This is the pilgrimage of Henry James.

34:29.927 --> 34:37.819
They had probably met at some literary reception in New York,

34:38.052 --> 34:52.530
because Edmund Wilson wrote an article for The New Republic entitled Unlikely Encounters, which purports to be a report of a conversation between Van White Brooks and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

34:53.551 --> 34:57.756
Maybe it happened, maybe it didn't happen, maybe Edmund Wilson was getting an article.

34:58.437 --> 35:02.642
All of you journalists are notoriously untrustworthy in that matter.

35:03.382 --> 35:22.832
But there's the copy of The Great Gatsby that Fitzgerald sends to Van White Brooks, and it's backed up by the book Brooks sends to Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald's copy of Brooks' biography of Mark Twain.

35:24.355 --> 35:29.743
But I always play the game when people come, and the game is pick a book.

35:30.247 --> 35:30.707
Pick a book.

35:30.768 --> 35:31.128
Any book?

35:31.148 --> 35:31.608
Pick a book.

35:31.969 --> 35:32.649
You want me to pick a book?

35:32.669 --> 35:33.330
Luck of the draw.

35:33.370 --> 35:33.830
Pick a book.

35:34.191 --> 35:34.651
Okay.

35:35.872 --> 35:43.740
This is where you can't tell a book by its cover, so let's just pick something just totally that makes, that doesn't resonate with a title or anything like that.

35:43.760 --> 35:44.901
James Branch Campbell.

35:46.883 --> 35:53.630
Who would not be regarded today as a major author, maybe a major, minor author, but I'm sure there are people who might dispute that, but here we go.

35:53.770 --> 35:59.275
For Scott Fitzgerald, anything hereinafter, which he may happen to like.

35:59.693 --> 36:03.799
with the best wishes of Branch Campbell, 27 September, 1934.

36:03.819 --> 36:06.323
Yes, 27 or 29.

36:06.363 --> 36:15.077
So actually, any book we pull out, look, he kept us in pretty good shape, didn't he?

36:15.137 --> 36:15.297
Yeah.

36:15.398 --> 36:16.760
I think.

36:16.780 --> 36:17.541
So let's pick another one.

36:17.561 --> 36:17.922
Do it again.

36:18.222 --> 36:18.743
Do it again.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.687
There must be one that you'd jump at pretty quickly.

36:21.708 --> 36:25.674
Let's pick this copy of Caps at Reveille, Scrivener.

36:26.876 --> 36:27.777
Oh, this is wonderful.

36:28.212 --> 36:29.713
Yeah, this is good, isn't it?

36:29.733 --> 36:29.934
Yeah.

36:29.954 --> 36:36.039
This is a whole full page of inscription to Anna Williamson, A-N-N-A-H.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.701
Other people were young once, just like you.

36:38.882 --> 36:48.230
They broke their hearts over things that now seem trivial, but they were their own hearts, and they had the right to meddle with them in their own way.

36:48.310 --> 36:53.575
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Asheville, 1936, courtesy of D.W., whatever that is.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.177
Dorothy Williamson.

36:56.461 --> 37:02.170
was Fitzgerald's nurse during the crack-up period in Asheville.

37:02.871 --> 37:05.174
So, is this a pretty interesting inscription?

37:05.475 --> 37:06.396
I think so.

37:06.476 --> 37:10.081
Interesting beyond the wonderful... Well, you know, most other authors do best wishes.

37:10.562 --> 37:10.943
That's right.

37:10.963 --> 37:11.444
Good luck.

37:12.906 --> 37:24.223
Fitzgerald almost always managed to say something witty, something warm, and often he managed to say something about the book.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.084
For example,

37:25.705 --> 37:37.204
The failure of Tender is the Night never stopped hurting him.

37:37.665 --> 37:38.326
No, this won't do it.

37:38.987 --> 37:47.121
And so when he inscribed Tenders, he would give people instructions on how to read it.

37:47.802 --> 37:48.844
Look at that.

37:49.617 --> 37:50.738
Yeah, that's a nice inscription.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.860
That's a great chest jacket, too, isn't it?

37:52.880 --> 37:53.020
Yeah.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.001
Look, it's a whole page.

37:54.261 --> 38:02.890
Yeah, full page inscription to an English lady he knew on the Riviera, and reminding her of the good times they had on the Riviera.

38:02.990 --> 38:07.955
But she kept it very nice, didn't she?

38:08.755 --> 38:15.302
The ones... It's astonishing to me that people trust those jackets, which are so beautiful.

38:18.765 --> 38:18.865
Yeah.

38:22.372 --> 38:45.603
For Ned Griffith, who was someone Fitzgerald knew in Hollywood, a Hollywood writer, who liked Gatsby with the recommendation that someday he dip into this, this being tender as the night, at page 151, and if he is interested in those chapters, goes back and reads the story with admiration from Scott Fitzgerald, Hollywood, 1939.

38:45.643 --> 38:48.487
Why is he flagellating himself here?

38:48.507 --> 38:51.130
And that inscription, in other words,

38:53.337 --> 38:54.339
Bless you.

38:54.359 --> 38:54.699
Bless you.

38:54.739 --> 39:00.448
Same message, same content is repeated at least a dozen times.

39:01.370 --> 39:15.012
He was so concerned that people were confused by the flashback structure, that he would go around telling people how to read the book.

39:15.032 --> 39:18.417
You'd never know this as a scholar and as a writer.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.703
as an observer of Fitzgerald.

39:21.723 --> 39:24.205
You'd never know this about him if you didn't collect his books.

39:24.486 --> 39:24.886
Correct.

39:24.906 --> 39:25.327
Is that right?

39:25.367 --> 39:25.527
Yeah.

39:26.007 --> 39:32.855
So this is where really a collector of other people's copies of your subjects' books gives you something, doesn't it?

39:33.055 --> 39:38.661
I have written maybe three books about Tender is the Night and how to read it.

39:38.681 --> 39:46.750
And these inscriptions have been of enormous help to me because they told me

39:47.540 --> 39:49.562
what Fitzgerald's intentions were.

39:50.323 --> 39:59.671
And I am a devout intentionalist surrounded by colleagues who say the author doesn't know what he's doing, and even if he does, it doesn't matter.

40:01.052 --> 40:05.496
Whereas I say, if the author doesn't know what he's doing, why read the fucking thing?

40:07.518 --> 40:09.340
Of course the author knows what he's doing.

40:11.722 --> 40:13.884
Genius always knows what it's doing.

40:15.986 --> 40:17.007
And, uh,

40:18.320 --> 40:40.643
Well, Fitzgerald's inscriptions, which help us, not me, us, to understand Fitzgerald's intentions for the work he inscribed, are invaluable keys to how to read.

40:41.564 --> 40:42.365
Tender is the night.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.547
How to read.

40:46.265 --> 40:48.829
This Side of Paradise, How to Read the Great Gatsby.

40:49.029 --> 40:53.936
And in this particular book, he apparently felt that they weren't reading it properly.

40:54.237 --> 40:55.499
This book above perhaps?

40:55.519 --> 40:56.781
No, but he's saying it was his fault.

40:57.542 --> 40:58.643
He's saying, I did it wrong.

40:59.565 --> 41:00.166
That's what he's saying.

41:00.186 --> 41:02.569
So you think if he had a chance to take a second whack at this?

41:02.609 --> 41:03.731
Well, he did.

41:03.751 --> 41:11.783
Famously, when he died, they found among his possessions a copy of Tender is the Night, disbound.

41:12.556 --> 41:18.464
with the chapters reordered, with a note saying, this is the final version of my book.

41:18.605 --> 41:20.327
Kind of like a deathbed edition.

41:20.868 --> 41:23.672
As I would like to see it published.

41:24.193 --> 41:41.297
And in 1951, Malcolm Cowley edited and published the so-called author's final version of Tender, 1951.

41:41.665 --> 41:45.992
seven years after the initial publication of Tender.

41:46.853 --> 41:59.592
And instead of everybody, all the readers, all the reviewers, saying, oh boy, now, at long last, we have the book the way it should be, it made no impression at all.

42:01.896 --> 42:08.386
Because whatever flaws there are in the 1934 edition, that's the way the author wrote it.

42:08.886 --> 42:09.327
That's right.

42:09.627 --> 42:10.568
Do you agree with that?

42:10.588 --> 42:10.989
Of course.

42:11.009 --> 42:12.972
I do, too.

42:12.992 --> 42:13.653
That's the way it is.

42:13.733 --> 42:14.734
And you can't fret about it.

42:14.774 --> 42:15.575
You just have to go on.

42:16.036 --> 42:17.098
What else would you like to see?

42:17.118 --> 42:19.100
You want to talk about the things in the walls?

42:19.561 --> 42:22.986
You're doing splendidly.

42:23.026 --> 42:24.668
I'm following your cues here.

42:25.189 --> 42:27.252
I'm thrilled with everything that you're showing me.

42:28.674 --> 42:31.398
That's the earliest Fitzgerald manuscript I've ever seen.

42:31.798 --> 42:33.681
It was a poem he wrote in prep school.

42:35.684 --> 42:38.588
You wouldn't predict that this man would write tender as the night.

42:38.973 --> 42:43.298
This was written at Newman School, that prep school he attended in Hackensack, New Jersey.

42:43.318 --> 42:53.110
Helen and Dorothy, I love you with all the love that mortal can, but nevertheless I'm a bit more true to the old, old sweetheart, wonderful Anne.

42:54.511 --> 42:57.535
Then the second stanza, he gets into trouble.

42:57.555 --> 43:06.145
Marie and Loey and Antoinette, Eleanor Kitty and Dream Babette, girls in the East, girls in the West,

43:07.120 --> 43:09.323
I really don't know which I like the best.

43:10.665 --> 43:15.391
To call it Juvenalia is to give a deaf book, but it's fabulous.

43:15.792 --> 43:19.197
You're talking about a book, you are a book man first.

43:19.217 --> 43:24.424
When you're talking about book, is it the book, or are we talking about fiction here in your view?

43:24.764 --> 43:27.648
You also use book and literature almost.

43:27.728 --> 43:34.157
I'm talking about the book as the expression of a genius's mind.

43:36.989 --> 44:00.576
And since I was trained by the greatest textual scholar who ever lived, the greatest bibliographical theorist who ever lived, Fredson Bowers at the University of Virginia, I was trained in the methods of recovering the author's intention, the way to edit what was called in those days a definitive edition.

44:01.457 --> 44:06.203
And so therefore, I have done definitive editions of Gatsby,

44:06.757 --> 44:15.129
Tender and The Last Tycoon, for which I recovered Fitzgerald's title, The Love of the Last Tycoon.

44:15.650 --> 44:16.952
That was Fitzgerald's title.

44:17.032 --> 44:27.807
It was published as The Last Tycoon because Edmund Wilson, who did the salvage job, didn't like Love of the Last Tycoon, and he called it The Last Tycoon.

44:28.268 --> 44:35.158
But I have done what used to be called definitive editions, which has become a junk word.

44:35.619 --> 44:36.460
That word definitive.

44:36.895 --> 44:38.938
has become cheapened and meaningless.

44:40.419 --> 44:42.582
So I prefer to use the term critical edition.

44:43.343 --> 45:01.466
A critical edition is an edition based on all of the drafts, pre-publication material, as well as the alterations and revisions the author may have made in the book post-publication, when the book was reset.

45:02.567 --> 45:06.632
And impossible to do it.

45:07.355 --> 45:09.819
without the material in this room.

45:11.041 --> 45:21.898
If there was a reason for building the collection, it was so I could do critical editions of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

45:23.781 --> 45:28.088
What other authors do you feel deserve or would warrant this kind of ?

45:28.409 --> 45:34.138
Hemingway certainly deserves it, but the Hemingway establishment

45:35.620 --> 45:37.562
causes me to grieve.

45:38.684 --> 45:42.068
I don't think Hemingway is in good hands.

45:42.809 --> 45:44.130
Hemingway certainly deserves it.

45:44.751 --> 45:46.353
Faulkner certainly deserves it.

45:47.214 --> 45:55.844
In 20th century writers, Dos Passos, probably.

45:57.747 --> 46:03.754
Probably USA requires editing.

46:03.886 --> 46:09.956
Editing in the sense of recovering and preserving Das Paso's intentions.

46:11.679 --> 46:15.525
You were involved some years back on recovering what you called lost.

46:15.545 --> 46:20.173
For seven years, I was director of the Center for Editions of American Authors.

46:20.744 --> 46:23.388
which was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

46:23.589 --> 46:29.539
And we did Hawthorne, and we did Melville, and we did Emerson, and we did Thoreau, and we did Whitman, the American classics.

46:29.559 --> 46:29.799
Oh, sure.

46:29.819 --> 46:33.004
So then we have the Library of America trying to do that, doing that.

46:33.024 --> 46:38.714
Well, I have grave reservations about the Library of America.

46:40.357 --> 46:45.385
I've never seen a nonprofit organization so profitable.

46:46.934 --> 47:04.641
But the Center of Editions of American Authors, or CAA, as it was called, had 144 definitive editions or critical editions completed at the time I resigned.

47:06.844 --> 47:12.553
But was it largely 19th-century type of authors that you mentioned?

47:12.837 --> 47:16.400
It's always better if you can work on an author who's in public domain.

47:16.440 --> 47:16.681
Sure.

47:16.941 --> 47:26.450
Because if they're in copyright, their families can drive you crazy.

47:26.770 --> 47:30.414
Indeed, and undoubtedly will drive you crazy, not only can.

47:30.434 --> 47:34.918
What can you tell about Fitzgerald from his own reading of other people's books?

47:35.379 --> 47:42.085
He was not the uneducated,

47:42.335 --> 47:49.323
man that the rumors would have.

47:50.905 --> 47:53.468
Sure, he was probably the worst student Princeton ever had.

47:53.529 --> 47:56.292
Doesn't signify anything.

47:57.393 --> 48:06.825
Fitzgerald knew that there was nothing in the chemistry classrooms and the math classrooms at Princeton he needed, that he could possibly use.

48:07.906 --> 48:09.608
So he flunked out.

48:09.993 --> 48:20.509
because he neglected the required courses, and he wrote for every publication at Princeton, with the exception of the Daily Princetonian.

48:20.889 --> 48:25.556
But he wrote three Triangle Club shows, wrote his first Triangle Club show as a freshman.

48:25.657 --> 48:25.937
Wow.

48:28.140 --> 48:32.667
He wrote whole issues of the Princeton Tiger overnight.

48:34.209 --> 48:39.257
He wrote serious short stories

48:39.575 --> 48:41.278
and a great deal of poetry.

48:41.999 --> 48:49.133
When he was at Princeton, he wasn't sure whether he wanted to be a novelist or a poet for the Nassau Literary Magazine.

48:49.594 --> 48:57.067
And this section here has all of his Princetoniana, some of it very rare.

48:57.428 --> 49:02.798
In addition, it has the

49:11.620 --> 49:17.286
second of the only known two complete runs of his St.

49:17.346 --> 49:20.349
Paul Academy, which was a day school.

49:21.230 --> 49:22.251
He attended in St.

49:22.271 --> 49:24.534
Paul between 1910 and 1912.

49:24.614 --> 49:33.904
This volume, which unfortunately was rebound when I got it, and for some reason, the issues weren't bound in chronological order.

49:34.384 --> 49:38.168
Nonetheless, this volume is a complete set

49:38.519 --> 49:40.581
of the issues of the St.

49:40.601 --> 49:48.730
Paul Academy now and then, 1910, 1912, which has all of Fitzgerald's earliest publications.

49:48.750 --> 49:49.410
That's what matters.

49:50.432 --> 49:55.977
And there are two sets in the world, reputedly one at the St.

49:55.997 --> 49:59.461
Paul Academy, which I've never seen, and this one.

50:00.883 --> 50:01.363
There you go.

50:02.725 --> 50:05.067
Pretty good, and in remarkably great shape.

50:05.283 --> 50:29.666
Are you able to assess the impact that Fitzgerald had on, you know, the readership, his times, and whether or not you feel, and I don't want to really mean to go off on a wild tangent, but I am kind of interested in your thoughts on, is it possible for a novelist, a fiction writer today, to have the kind of impact that people, that writers such as Fitzgerald might have had?

50:29.686 --> 50:34.210
I think not because of electronic.

50:34.443 --> 50:37.127
So you are fearful then that this is... Publication.

50:37.607 --> 50:42.294
Fitzgerald was a words-on-paper writer.

50:43.395 --> 50:57.254
Fitzgerald wrote at the time when reading was not just a habit of certain people, but when everybody read.

50:59.056 --> 51:03.943
It was a time when there were

51:05.932 --> 51:14.744
scores of mass-circulation magazines, and they all had fiction.

51:18.950 --> 51:27.642
It was a time when there were—every American city had multiple newspapers.

51:28.364 --> 51:31.087
People read the morning paper, people read the afternoon paper.

51:31.107 --> 51:31.848
I did, too.

51:33.310 --> 51:35.854
My father brought home five newspapers a day.

51:36.340 --> 51:41.967
I think I got most of my education from William Randolph Hearst in my boyhood.

51:44.030 --> 52:05.217
Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Faulkner, all of the geniuses of the 1920s into the 1930s, were writing for an audience of hungry readers, people who read spontaneously

52:05.838 --> 52:07.740
for pleasure, for enjoyment.

52:09.261 --> 52:32.824
And I don't think any reader, after, oh, the 60s, which have a lot to answer for, approaches, approached then, approaches now.

52:34.795 --> 52:51.655
the reading experience, the little black marks on the pieces of paper, the way Fitzgerald's readers and Hemingway's readers and Faulkner's readers responded to the experience of reading literature.

52:53.257 --> 52:58.002
And then the computers came along and turned everyone's brains to mush.

53:00.445 --> 53:01.326
When did you become

53:02.403 --> 53:14.365
I mean, you mentioned that William Randolph Hearst is your teacher as a child emerging in New York, as a youngster, but when do you become captured by fiction?

53:16.149 --> 53:18.132
I grew up in a house without books.

53:19.455 --> 53:21.238
I had no books at all as a child.

53:21.742 --> 53:25.287
Finally, somebody gave me one book entitled Billion Blaze.

53:25.407 --> 53:26.368
And finally is when?

53:26.388 --> 53:27.409
Like, how old are you?

53:27.429 --> 53:28.350
Just approximately.

53:28.370 --> 53:30.533
Just, you know, a little kid or a teenager or what?

53:30.553 --> 53:31.074
Seven, eight.

53:31.094 --> 53:31.494
Seven, eight.

53:31.515 --> 53:32.356
So you're a little kid.

53:32.376 --> 53:33.317
All right.

53:33.337 --> 53:34.078
But that was one book.

53:34.799 --> 53:35.480
I had one book.

53:39.405 --> 53:44.391
And my parents.

53:45.434 --> 53:48.757
What you did was you read the same book over and over again.

53:48.777 --> 53:50.379
I didn't understand why you needed two books.

53:51.600 --> 54:02.851
And then I got to PS83 in the Bronx, where there was a room with a couple of hundred books in it.

54:02.871 --> 54:03.812
That was the library.

54:04.873 --> 54:10.498
And you were supposed to go there one hour a week and read.

54:12.300 --> 54:14.462
Nobody in the school did that.

54:14.813 --> 54:18.797
And the man in charge was Mr. Lipschitz.

54:19.538 --> 54:25.284
And he granted me the extraordinary privilege of taking one book home Friday afternoon.

54:25.845 --> 54:27.146
But I had to bring it back Monday morning.

54:28.388 --> 54:31.151
And I read my way through that room.

54:31.371 --> 54:32.232
And that was the beginning.

54:32.552 --> 54:35.095
We've got a class to do, right, at 11 a.m.?

54:35.115 --> 54:35.515
That's all right.

54:35.535 --> 54:36.216
This is Scotty.

54:36.877 --> 54:38.078
This is more important.

54:38.098 --> 54:38.799
This is Scotty.

54:38.839 --> 54:39.960
Scotty's more important.

54:40.109 --> 54:45.594
Scotty is the patron of this room, of this collection.

54:45.614 --> 54:46.395
She helped me.

54:46.435 --> 54:47.937
She encouraged me.

54:47.957 --> 54:50.299
I think she loved me.

54:50.319 --> 54:52.061
I certainly loved her.

54:52.621 --> 54:53.482
I cherished her.

54:53.722 --> 54:54.403
I adored her.

54:55.003 --> 54:56.945
She's the enabler, as they would say today.

54:57.906 --> 55:09.998
And this collection would not be here were it not for the previous librarian, George Terry, the genius who hired Patrick Scott

55:10.265 --> 55:26.000
the genius who bought the Heller Collection, who insisted that the Fitzgerald Collection came here, and who somehow made the acquisition of the Hemingway Collection possible.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.842
George Terry died at 50.

55:29.943 --> 55:37.150
This has supposedly taken the day we agreed, we made the deal for the Fitzgerald Collection.

55:38.395 --> 55:39.757
Are you going to be around later today?

55:39.877 --> 55:42.481
I'd like to come back and take some pictures, too.

55:42.862 --> 55:45.105
Do you mind if I take some photographs?

55:45.125 --> 55:45.445
Of course not.

55:46.847 --> 55:49.632
But credit where credit is due.

55:50.052 --> 55:51.374
We're just scratching the surface.

55:51.655 --> 55:55.821
George deserves as much credit as I do.

55:56.742 --> 56:00.047
And Scotty deserves more credit.

56:00.067 --> 56:03.812
They're the enablers, but I have to say, you're still the guy who got it done.

56:03.893 --> 56:06.917
If it hadn't been for Scotty, I wouldn't have done it.

56:07.792 --> 56:09.114
Because I did it to please her.

56:11.177 --> 56:15.604
May I say, with all due respect, I think you were driven a little bit more than that.

56:16.025 --> 56:17.788
No, no.

56:17.808 --> 56:18.469
I'm going to come back.

56:18.529 --> 56:19.050
May I come back?

56:19.090 --> 56:22.796
When?

56:23.016 --> 56:26.121
If it had only the Isaac Rosenberg material, did Patrick tell you?

56:26.320 --> 56:29.983
that there are three libraries in the world who have Rosenberg complete.

56:30.463 --> 56:30.904
He did tell me that.

56:30.924 --> 56:31.705
He did tell me that.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.006
Yale, Oxford.

56:33.106 --> 56:33.666
That's amazing.

56:33.826 --> 56:34.447
USC.

56:34.767 --> 56:37.990
Not the British Museum, not the Imperial War Museum.

56:38.010 --> 56:38.070
Us.

56:38.190 --> 56:39.211
That's amazing.

56:39.471 --> 56:40.772
I'm going to just put my stuff there.

56:40.792 --> 56:42.474
Sure.

56:42.494 --> 56:45.116
Well, why don't we just continue our conversation a little bit?

56:45.156 --> 56:46.577
Do you mind my shooting some pictures?

56:46.697 --> 56:47.178
No, of course not.

56:47.218 --> 56:51.561
And then I'd love to have one later with that briefcase.

56:53.363 --> 56:56.125
Just, you know, casual stuff.

56:57.202 --> 57:01.348
This represents an extraordinary achievement.

57:02.970 --> 57:14.567
As you know, the great Gatsby's, the black orchid, this is worth about $150,000, the first printing and dust jacket.

57:14.587 --> 57:17.871
When I was a graduate student, I bought it for $30, this copy.

57:18.552 --> 57:19.654
And I didn't have $30.

57:19.714 --> 57:21.837
I paid it off $5 at a time.

57:22.017 --> 57:22.798
Excellent.

57:22.818 --> 57:24.841
How did you find such a jacket?

57:24.861 --> 57:26.263
Henry Winning had it.

57:26.733 --> 57:32.401
As I said, I paid $30, and it's now worth $150,000.

57:32.921 --> 57:34.103
But that's easy.

57:34.303 --> 57:39.911
You know, if you want to already check $150,000, you can get one, no problem.

57:40.211 --> 57:56.233
But here is the second printing with the corrected J. Here is the third printing with the blurbs.

57:57.142 --> 57:57.783
It's better.

58:00.106 --> 58:09.638
Here is the English edition using the American dust shack.

58:09.678 --> 58:12.121
Now tell me why it is... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:12.141 --> 58:12.942
It's going to get better.

58:16.066 --> 58:20.752
Now.

58:20.772 --> 58:21.212
There it is.

58:21.252 --> 58:25.798
They couldn't sell it.

58:26.318 --> 58:28.221
They couldn't give it away in London.

58:28.241 --> 58:29.863
You're telling me this is the remainder copy?

58:30.123 --> 58:31.445
This is the remainder copy.

58:32.326 --> 58:32.987
Two and six.

58:33.768 --> 58:34.209
Wow.

58:34.389 --> 58:36.952
They sold it at seven shillings.

58:38.074 --> 58:39.516
Only nobody wanted it.

58:39.536 --> 58:40.938
So they lowered it at two and six.

58:41.278 --> 58:42.720
And where does that go in the car?

58:43.040 --> 58:43.942
What do you think?

58:43.962 --> 58:45.644
And nobody else has it.

58:46.245 --> 58:47.426
Nobody else has it?

58:47.446 --> 58:51.372
Then they couldn't sell it at two and six, and they reduced it to two.

58:51.732 --> 58:53.895
They knocked off sixpence, for Christ's sake.

58:55.343 --> 58:58.166
How is something like this important to you as a scholar?

58:58.186 --> 59:02.091
Are you indulging your passion as a collector here?

59:02.231 --> 59:03.553
No, it's got nothing to do with collecting.

59:04.434 --> 59:17.469
If The Great Gatsby is the great American novel, then anything that documents the reception and reputation is meaningful as literary history.

59:17.489 --> 59:24.557
It is meaningful that The Great Gatsby was a flop.

59:25.229 --> 59:29.195
in England and a relative failure in the United States when it was published.

59:29.936 --> 59:34.443
The dopes didn't know how good it was, except for Gilbert Seldes.

59:34.463 --> 59:40.832
Gilbert Seldes wrote that great review saying, Fitzgerald is now ahead of all of his contemporaries, which drove Hemingway bonkers.

59:43.776 --> 59:49.004
So you could sit around and say, well, it wasn't a success in receptionist discipline.

59:49.986 --> 59:55.033
The enemy of literary history, the enemy of literary biography,

59:55.267 --> 59:57.751
is talk, is conversation.

59:58.593 --> 01:00:03.301
This substitutes evidence for chit-chat.

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:11.636
And textually, however, the book is the same from one ... It's a photo offset reprint.

01:00:11.656 --> 01:00:12.918
It's a photo offset.

01:00:12.938 --> 01:00:13.099
Okay.

01:00:13.479 --> 01:00:13.940
Well, no.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.463
They use the same plates.

01:00:15.483 --> 01:00:17.747
They shipped a duplicate set of plates to England.

01:00:20.444 --> 01:00:22.248
Which is not true of other English editions.

01:00:22.729 --> 01:00:23.270
Very interesting.

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.654
Where they, you know, they did the English spelling.
