WEBVTT

00:03.659 --> 00:11.280
Congratulations on your official title here.

00:12.283 --> 00:17.618
My official title is Vice President and Publisher of the Children's Book Department.

00:17.902 --> 00:19.967
Of children's books, I think.

00:19.987 --> 00:23.314
And you arrived here after 10 years at the Horn Book.

00:23.334 --> 00:24.356
Yeah, 11 years.

00:24.376 --> 00:26.220
11 years at the Horn Book.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.271
So you certainly served a tenure in keeping with the tradition over there.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.577
I guess you were the sixth editor in the 70-year history.

00:33.597 --> 00:36.062
Yeah, I was the sixth editor, and...

00:36.903 --> 00:41.428
It's interesting, many of the tenures run around in that ten-year vein.

00:41.469 --> 00:42.970
That's not unusual.

00:43.591 --> 00:47.996
That's more than the Constitution allows Presidents to serve.

00:48.016 --> 00:48.377
I know.

00:52.342 --> 00:52.782
That's true.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.145
It's like I got that third term, right?

00:55.185 --> 01:05.037
I'm a great bibliophile, and I have my own book out right now, which is a

01:05.573 --> 01:06.735
obtained to books.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.377
It's called A Gentle Madness.

01:08.437 --> 01:10.299
I don't know if you know anything about it.

01:10.319 --> 01:12.422
It's about bibliophilia, bibliomania.

01:13.043 --> 01:15.106
It's doing pretty good.

01:15.126 --> 01:17.369
It's third printing, and we have with Holt.

01:18.450 --> 01:24.959
And I have two sections in the book about women who put together extraordinary collections of children's books.

01:24.999 --> 01:31.227
Betsy Shirley, Betsy Beinecke Shirley, whose collection is going to

01:31.628 --> 01:32.249
to Yale.

01:32.449 --> 01:33.170
Oh, okay.

01:33.410 --> 01:33.751
Yale.

01:34.171 --> 01:43.022
And when I interviewed her, walking in her home in New Jersey, she has the original painting from the Wyatt, the Treasure Island.

01:43.042 --> 01:43.542
Treasure Island, oh.

01:43.582 --> 01:44.764
And there's that blank spot.

01:44.784 --> 01:49.650
I said to my wife, I said, look, thousands of times have you seen this.

01:49.730 --> 01:50.451
There's the painting.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.412
Yeah, yeah.

01:51.432 --> 01:55.837
And she collects original art, and her collection is extraordinary.

01:55.857 --> 01:56.918
Yeah, yeah.

01:56.938 --> 01:58.260
It's the finest by far.

01:58.898 --> 02:00.360
Beinecke is her middle name.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.241
Okay, yeah.

02:01.422 --> 02:12.958
I was going to say, from that book, you may have noticed, but I think one of the greatest, I was able to use it in color, I think one of the greatest illustrations of all times is Blind Pew Groping Down the Road.

02:12.978 --> 02:21.110
I just think that is such an extraordinary, it's sort of the image of great illustrated books from around the turn of the century.

02:21.591 --> 02:25.196
Tell me about, this is quite an undertaking, this book that you did here.

02:25.216 --> 02:26.458
Yeah, it, it, um,

02:27.417 --> 02:33.166
I was approached by an editor who said, what reference book don't you have?

02:33.627 --> 02:39.597
At Houghton, they were thinking of doing a children's reference book, and she sort of said, what reference book doesn't exist?

02:39.938 --> 02:53.560
And I basically outlined the idea of this book, that we needed something that focused on the 20th century, particularly the latter part, because so much of the reference work for children's books published

02:53.860 --> 02:56.644
focus on the history and the classics and things like that.

02:56.684 --> 03:21.724
We really needed something of the latter part of the 20th century, something in which creators themselves might talk, as well as there be essays on them, and that would try to give us an overview of basically the field, and the field as we see it now, you know, at the end of the 20th century, rather than how it was perceived sort of midway.

03:22.447 --> 03:26.853
And she said, it sounds wonderful, why don't you do it?

03:26.873 --> 03:27.855
That's how it happened.

03:28.536 --> 03:28.976
Terrific.

03:28.996 --> 03:32.301
How long did you assign the essays?

03:32.321 --> 03:33.483
Right, I had to assign the essays.

03:33.503 --> 03:34.744
I had to come up with the lists.

03:36.006 --> 03:46.581
The manuscript, which came to about 3,000 pages, had to be pulled together in about a year and a half, because you can't have

03:46.915 --> 03:55.510
One written in 1993 and one written in 1996, you know, because then suddenly different bodies of work by an author are being prepared.

03:56.091 --> 03:59.437
So it really had to turn around in a rather short period of time.

03:59.557 --> 04:06.088
So that was the great hurdle, was sort of getting everything together and in.

04:06.220 --> 04:08.582
in a final manuscript that could be published.

04:08.602 --> 04:11.485
And getting these contributors who agreed to be able to do this.

04:11.506 --> 04:12.066
That's right.

04:12.226 --> 04:18.413
And to do it and to, you know, work with them on the essays to get the essays sort of shaped up in some way.

04:20.114 --> 04:21.316
I love reference books.

04:21.576 --> 04:23.558
And I quite agree.

04:23.598 --> 04:27.642
And I have whatever children's books references there are, too.

04:28.243 --> 04:30.165
And, you know, it's terrific.

04:30.185 --> 04:31.246
It's right up there on the shelf.

04:31.266 --> 04:33.568
I write a lot of children's book reviews.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.991
My wife and I do the children's books together, I have to say.

04:36.865 --> 04:43.038
And we do at least two a year, one for summer and for now.

04:43.859 --> 04:45.864
And I try and get about 120 books in.

04:45.984 --> 04:47.286
Oh, yeah.

04:47.306 --> 04:48.349
And whatever I can get.

04:48.369 --> 04:49.812
But I really do select them.

04:49.832 --> 04:50.633
I mean, we really have.

04:50.653 --> 04:54.541
And I noticed that we've noted trends over recent years.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.325
And I noticed in one of the interviews that you did,

04:56.660 --> 05:01.147
It is amazing how functional children's books have become, and particularly the picture ones.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.328
I mean, there really are themes.

05:02.609 --> 05:02.889
Yes.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.773
And they're really addressed to... I'll comment on that.

05:05.793 --> 05:18.732
And I really look for themes that are in vogue for a particular year, or not necessarily vogue, but useful, and how wonderful the illustrations are, and really how beautiful they are.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.033
Yeah.

05:19.053 --> 05:23.359
I think that one of the main things that has changed, particularly when I was working on the picture book,

05:23.643 --> 05:44.592
essays here, and looking at picture books from Beatrix Potter, really, to contemporary days, you can really see how in the 1980s, when technology suddenly changed, and artists no longer had to do, you know, that wonderful full-color separation process that the British always used to call that primitive American art form that they had to do.

05:44.632 --> 05:50.460
When you could literally take any kind of artwork and put it in front of a camera, suddenly there's an explosion of

05:50.660 --> 06:10.051
the kinds of artists who come into the field, the way arts prepare, the range, the variety, the quality of artists, and literally, you know, people are hunting for artists in galleries now as opposed to hunting for somebody who's trained to do four-color separation, which is what you had to do before.

06:10.131 --> 06:16.161
So when you're thinking about ideas and looking for books, do you

06:16.681 --> 06:17.482
Does it matter?

06:18.603 --> 06:22.707
Does an author have to come to you with an artist, or do you try to be a matchmaker?

06:22.747 --> 06:24.810
No, you absolutely try to be a matchmaker.

06:25.170 --> 06:43.870
A lot of what good editors do and a lot of what happens in publishing houses is that you find that story or manuscript that you want to publish first, and then you, of the range of maybe a thousand artists that you may know whose work you may have seen,

06:44.322 --> 06:49.130
you then try to find the perfect artist and author to meld together.

06:49.471 --> 06:54.199
There are some people who are multi-talented and can write and illustrate their own.

06:54.379 --> 06:59.327
Steig and, you know, James Marshall, Chris Van Oldsburg, David McCauley, you know.

06:59.588 --> 07:04.155
I mean, some of the great, Alan Say, some of the great illustrators can really can write.

07:04.276 --> 07:06.339
Sendak, of course, you know, Lobel.

07:06.479 --> 07:07.461
I mean, you know...

07:07.711 --> 07:08.853
that can do both.

07:09.253 --> 07:13.420
But very often facility with words isn't necessarily facility with images.

07:13.540 --> 07:24.216
So that's a lot of what... But I think in the world of editing and publishing, it really is, if not unique, it really is quite a responsibility, an added dimension to the job.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.037
Oh, absolutely.

07:25.057 --> 07:28.602
It's not like getting an adult novel and that's all you have to focus on.

07:28.722 --> 07:30.425
And then working on it and making sure it works.

07:32.027 --> 07:37.195
It takes that extra skill of even reading a picture book text

07:37.445 --> 07:49.877
you know, just in manuscript, you have to be able to envision what could an artist do with it, because it, you know, sometimes just picture book text alone when you read them, without the art, you can't imagine.

07:49.897 --> 08:02.710
It's almost a throwback, isn't it, because the great, I love to collect 19th century fiction, and of course when you had Mark Twain paired up with an artist who would visualize

08:02.875 --> 08:05.820
And you have Fizz with Dickens, I guess.

08:05.840 --> 08:06.681
Oh, exactly.

08:06.721 --> 08:07.963
And Carol and Tenniel.

08:08.444 --> 08:08.965
Exactly.

08:08.985 --> 08:14.874
And, of course, that largely disappeared in the 20th century from the adult level.

08:15.294 --> 08:20.783
You only find people like Barry Moser trying to go back to that.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.444
with mixed results, I think.

08:23.725 --> 08:29.958
Yeah, and John Gardner, as you know, had some of his novels illustrated, did some of that illustrated work in novels.

08:30.118 --> 08:30.719
I love that.

08:30.859 --> 08:38.695
Do you suppose it did disappear because of this, you know, the mass media and television and all these other things?

08:38.715 --> 08:40.459
Yeah, I don't know in...

08:41.603 --> 08:47.574
People often ask me about adult publishing, and I really, I must admit, I have a level of ignorance.

08:49.517 --> 08:52.302
And I just have to admit, I just have a level of ignorance.

08:52.843 --> 08:55.748
But in children's publishing, of course, that's never been given up.

08:55.869 --> 09:01.198
You know, I mean, we have a lot of middle grade novels in the same way, which...

09:01.297 --> 09:02.378
Again, the same thing.

09:02.418 --> 09:05.381
You have a text, and you're trying to find an illustrator for it.

09:05.441 --> 09:09.005
Lois Lowry's Anastasia books, or we have here at the Clifford's books.

09:09.025 --> 09:11.888
A whole variety of Beverly Cleary's novels.

09:12.068 --> 09:13.550
Again, they're illustrated.

09:14.171 --> 09:24.021
So I really think even fictions works best with suggestions of visual images sometimes, because they are quite delightful.

09:24.101 --> 09:26.143
I mean, it's wonderful to be able to see a character.

09:26.624 --> 09:29.447
When you see a manuscript text,

09:30.524 --> 09:35.971
And this is from a writer who really doesn't have a working relationship with an artist.

09:35.991 --> 09:40.116
And so now your job is really to make a match.

09:41.118 --> 09:45.443
Do you visualize, can you see some of the pictures?

09:45.483 --> 09:49.769
And you think which artist would be perfect for that?

09:49.789 --> 09:51.211
I mean, that goes back to what you've already said.

09:51.331 --> 09:52.392
But can you see the pictures?

09:52.673 --> 09:57.679
Well, I think you, the wonderful thing is, of course,

09:59.178 --> 10:03.164
An artist is so much more creative than you are.

10:03.605 --> 10:04.827
I mean, that's what you're hoping for.

10:05.087 --> 10:11.357
But what you can match is mood and nuance and the kind of thing that someone does and the sort of feeling.

10:11.837 --> 10:21.372
Yes, you can visualize some of it, but then literally that manuscript, after it's finished, is given to the artist, and the artist will then start to

10:21.689 --> 10:25.214
work on it, create it, create the scenes, create the settings.

10:26.096 --> 10:34.368
Sometimes you'll send it to an artist to do, we have a manuscript right here, just to do a couple of illustrations as to how it would look.

10:34.608 --> 10:41.959
And then you may say, oh, I like it, or no, maybe this isn't quite what we want.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.434
But a good artist will always do more than you can ever imagine.

10:46.454 --> 10:48.500
That's what's exciting about a picture book.

10:48.901 --> 10:52.692
I really like the collaboration with Chris and

10:53.009 --> 10:53.510
Yeah.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.994
Mark Halpern on Swan Lake.

10:56.014 --> 10:57.477
Right, Swan Lake, yes.

10:57.497 --> 11:01.523
Now, that's an example of an old illustrated book of that ilk, yeah.

11:01.584 --> 11:07.173
And it's taking a classic story, and you might just talk a little bit about classics.

11:07.193 --> 11:10.158
That's almost a perfect example, isn't it, of a timeless story?

11:10.298 --> 11:10.939
That's right, yeah.

11:10.959 --> 11:14.285
And what does make a story timeless or classic?

11:14.926 --> 11:19.033
I always think they're very...

11:19.621 --> 11:20.382
simple things.

11:20.402 --> 11:24.026
When you look at the classics, they really have several simple things in common.

11:24.567 --> 11:30.954
One is often a story or plot line that is so compelling and remains compelling.

11:31.115 --> 11:37.462
Or it could be a character that, again, children can identify with.

11:37.502 --> 11:44.110
I mean, we really define classic as a book that survives more than one generation, a book that's passed down from

11:44.528 --> 11:46.952
yet to another generation to another generation.

11:47.452 --> 12:03.396
But it's usually those simple literary elements, a story that needs to be told, characters that work well, something that no matter what the window dressing of the time, the basic form works.

12:04.157 --> 12:09.545
The basic form still is compelling to a reader.

12:10.327 --> 12:14.012
Do you find that as an editor of children's books that

12:14.296 --> 12:19.204
You're walking kind of a fine line in that the target audience is the child.

12:19.264 --> 12:26.075
But to get to that child, you have to impress the person who, in all likelihood, will be buying the book, which is an adult.

12:26.275 --> 12:33.486
And I find that, you know, the books that we love, we were collecting children's books long before we had children.

12:33.727 --> 12:34.207
Right, yeah.

12:34.227 --> 12:36.211
Because I've been getting review books for 20 years.

12:36.751 --> 12:40.978
You know, wonderful, marvelous, I don't know, how many thousand children's books.

12:41.414 --> 12:43.116
But, you know, we love them.

12:43.177 --> 12:46.962
I mean, and they appeal to us, and then we kind of pass that on.

12:47.002 --> 12:50.868
Do you find that it is two audiences?

12:52.250 --> 12:55.695
Or is it necessary for you to try and reach the parent?

12:55.995 --> 13:01.583
I'm one of these people who really believes that the great books for children appeal both to adults.

13:01.763 --> 13:06.150
You know, they have those literary qualities that, as adults, we say, these are quite wonderful.

13:06.430 --> 13:08.273
But they also appeal to children.

13:08.313 --> 13:09.675
They also speak to children.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.117
That we are not talking...

13:11.688 --> 13:37.260
different kinds of things, that we're really, in the great, this is the great books, this is not the, this is not class B or class C, you know, that an adult reading Polar Express is going to read it on one level, and a child reading Polar Express is going to respond to even other things, and that the real classics, you really find the books that last over time, tend to have that double dimension.

13:37.521 --> 13:37.881
But

13:41.084 --> 13:56.524
you, as you said, it's the one field in which the adults do all the buying, so that there's always, and they do all the reading, and they do all the editing, and they do all the reviewing, and they do the, you know, I mean, it's an entire... So you've got to capture them first, don't you?

13:56.564 --> 14:06.737
So, well, if, I mean, I was raised in the school that in the end, you must think of the child, you know, remember the children.

14:06.837 --> 14:10.922
I mean, that's the, I think great children's publishers remember the children.

14:11.020 --> 14:14.103
That doesn't mean writing down.

14:14.124 --> 14:14.964
No, it doesn't mean writing.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.928
In fact, I believe it's having infinite respect for children.

14:18.508 --> 14:26.718
But the great creators, to me, always remember that the audience for this book is a child.

14:27.559 --> 14:29.961
And there's certainly publishing.

14:30.042 --> 14:31.583
That's publishing for adults.

14:31.603 --> 14:32.985
You know, it will attract adults.

14:33.485 --> 14:35.227
And it looks wonderful for adults.

14:35.888 --> 14:39.272
But those books don't last over time, because in the end, you know,

14:39.742 --> 14:41.445
I mean, I always talk about those books.

14:41.626 --> 14:43.429
I share books with children.

14:43.449 --> 14:53.308
And one of the books that I would consider in this category, and I won't name names, but the child I was sitting with read it and said, now I need to read it and we'll never have to read it again.

14:53.348 --> 14:59.139
And those books published for adults, you know, very often that's the response.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.602
And they don't live.

15:01.122 --> 15:03.605
Curious George, you know, lives.

15:04.246 --> 15:04.606
Does he ever.

15:04.646 --> 15:09.513
Does he ever, because, guess what, he really works with the child audience.

15:09.813 --> 15:11.295
My daughter threw up a picture of Curious George.

15:11.435 --> 15:13.758
And they pass it on, and it did the next generation.

15:13.778 --> 15:17.042
Dr. Seuss lives on because he wrote for children.

15:17.102 --> 15:18.524
He really wrote for the audience.

15:19.245 --> 15:30.960
So you can, I think, I think the problem is if you get confused in publishing and you say, okay, I am going to publish for the adults, you know, that they're

15:31.278 --> 15:35.922
There is a kind of publishing like that that's, you know, certainly goes on.

15:36.163 --> 15:44.530
There's also a kind of publishing that goes on that does not take the child reader very seriously and, you know, believes that they can be given anything.

15:44.630 --> 15:51.777
I just noticed yesterday, and we got in the mail, you know, a package sent to me in my post office.

15:51.797 --> 15:55.600
And I have a little syndicate, a literary features syndicate.

15:55.620 --> 16:00.525
My wife and I write for about 25 newspapers will get this story.

16:01.113 --> 16:05.797
a thing comes in, it's from Shaw's Supermarkets, and I said, what the heck is this?

16:05.817 --> 16:24.513
And they are launching a line of, and they had a couple of, I mean, we're talking, really, stuff that you'd expect in the rack of a supermarket, and I'm just wondering, you know, you talk about things that last, I'm sure they're going to price them about $2.95, $3.95, or whatever.

16:24.713 --> 16:25.674
Yes, yeah.

16:26.415 --> 16:28.236
How did I get into that line?

16:28.316 --> 16:30.158
But I mean, you talk about things that really,

16:30.762 --> 16:31.783
aren't going to last at all.

16:31.803 --> 16:33.145
Aren't going to last, I know.

16:33.205 --> 16:35.327
It's almost a cynical approach, isn't it?

16:35.347 --> 16:35.767
Yes, yeah.

16:35.787 --> 16:40.953
I mean, literally to offer them in supermarkets in the same... I'm not asking you to comment on that.

16:41.053 --> 16:43.756
Yes, obviously I can't, because it's coming from another, as you know.

16:43.816 --> 16:45.758
And I won't, but I'm just commenting here.

16:45.858 --> 16:46.458
Yeah, exactly.

16:46.619 --> 17:00.313
Don't worry about it, but it is a... Yeah, there is that kind of... I guess I'm kind of siguing into, here we are, what, five years from the millennium, and I'm asked, with my book, I've been giving these talks and things,

17:01.475 --> 17:09.082
like I should know, but, you know, CD-ROM and all this other stuff, what's going to come to, what's the book going to come to?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.223
Who knows, number one.

17:10.364 --> 17:10.564
Right.

17:10.584 --> 17:19.773
But number two, I mean, books started as clay tablets, and they were scrolls for hundreds of years, and they were manuscripts, and then they were printed books.

17:19.793 --> 17:23.156
Illuminated manuscripts, and then you come to Gutenberg, and then you come, yeah.

17:23.256 --> 17:25.098
But the concept of the book has always been there.

17:25.118 --> 17:29.642
There will always be a book, but whether or not, I mean, are you fearful that it will

17:30.618 --> 17:32.480
go away from hardcovers?

17:32.620 --> 17:38.086
I think, I'm one of these people who really has, I just have great faith in the book.

17:38.106 --> 17:44.653
You know, I have great faith in creative ideas certainly starting there.

17:44.713 --> 17:46.955
I think it may, you know, it may take many other forms.

17:47.015 --> 17:49.177
I mean, I, you know, I think... I would never predict.

17:49.498 --> 18:00.169
And I would never predict because I'm not a futurist, so that, you know, but I really... My next book, by the way, will have this as a coda, basically, this consideration, which is, I'm asking you

18:00.487 --> 18:02.749
for quotes now that may not necessarily be in this piece.

18:02.789 --> 18:03.530
Be in here, yeah.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.212
In fact, I might come back to you at some point.

18:05.232 --> 18:05.832
Okay, yeah.

18:05.852 --> 18:10.978
But I still, I believe in the power of what can be done in the form of a book.

18:11.258 --> 18:15.562
And, you know, as we always say, you know, you can take it anywhere.

18:15.602 --> 18:16.984
Well, mine is a little heavy.

18:17.004 --> 18:18.065
I can't really take it on them.

18:18.085 --> 18:19.747
But, you know, you can take it with you anywhere.

18:19.767 --> 18:20.467
It's portable.

18:20.608 --> 18:23.671
It's... This one, I know, exactly.

18:23.691 --> 18:26.794
You know, you can carry them anywhere, take them anywhere.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.937
There's something private and individual about them.

18:30.187 --> 18:35.574
You know, I really believe that the book has a tremendous amount of power to it.

18:36.295 --> 18:41.002
And I would hate for those of us to love books to forget what that power can be.

18:41.082 --> 18:45.849
But yes, will books probably go into many different formats like CD-ROMs and, you know, who knows?

18:45.909 --> 18:47.611
Which Houghton is doing the one with everybody else.

18:47.631 --> 18:49.253
Exactly, Houghton is doing with everyone else.

18:49.273 --> 18:50.575
Do you then take that?

18:50.875 --> 18:54.183
and make it available in other ways, absolutely.

18:54.604 --> 19:05.492
But I do believe that for creative people, working in a book form has a certain intimacy and excitement, and you know, otherwise why are all our politicians

19:05.708 --> 19:07.149
campaigning with their book tours.

19:07.530 --> 19:13.476
It's so strange in a society in which we say we're moving away from books.

19:13.516 --> 19:16.659
It would seem to me that the power of the book is quite extraordinary.

19:16.679 --> 19:20.503
I saw a statistic that he was with one of the press releases of his piece.

19:20.523 --> 19:28.250
I think it was a quote from you, in fact, that 40% of publishing is not children's books.

19:28.270 --> 19:28.931
Is that right?

19:28.951 --> 19:31.473
40% of books, give or take?

19:31.834 --> 19:32.354
Possible.

19:33.195 --> 19:35.277
Children's books have become

19:36.100 --> 19:39.664
a huge segment of publishing.

19:40.124 --> 19:47.032
You know, there was a boom in the 1980s in terms of just titles and numbers, and it was quite extraordinary.

19:47.072 --> 19:49.935
Part of that is the whole, you know, whole language in schools.

19:50.015 --> 19:53.679
Part of it was the growth of children's independent bookstores.

19:53.779 --> 19:58.324
Now other bookstores, the chains, are putting in huge children's segments.

19:58.444 --> 20:02.428
Oh, the new Barnes & Noble and Framie, I was just signing here two weeks ago.

20:03.607 --> 20:05.609
Number one, it's huge.

20:05.629 --> 20:06.109
It's a huge store.

20:06.409 --> 20:07.871
And right next door to Bordas.

20:08.171 --> 20:08.992
Oh, is it?

20:09.032 --> 20:09.972
Yeah, yeah.

20:09.992 --> 20:12.274
I mean, they're playing hardball, these guys.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.255
They really are, yes.

20:13.275 --> 20:14.236
Right next to each other.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.397
Absolutely, yeah.

20:15.457 --> 20:23.063
And I heard from the woman at Barnes & Noble that Bordas may respond by building yet another larger store.

20:23.384 --> 20:28.008
Instead of leaving and being scared away, they might just expand, you know.

20:28.048 --> 20:28.668
Yeah, I know.

20:28.688 --> 20:30.450
I was just in Bordas last night, as a matter of fact.

20:30.470 --> 20:30.950
The one in Framingham.

20:30.970 --> 20:32.031
Yeah, the one in Framingham.

20:32.171 --> 20:33.192
Yeah, it is.

20:33.543 --> 20:36.226
But again, a large children's section.

20:36.286 --> 20:39.729
Did you see that section over there where they come in, a little area where the kids can sit?

20:39.749 --> 20:41.311
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

20:41.331 --> 20:44.234
I signed on a Saturday, and I said, well, a crowd, maybe I'll get a crowd.

20:44.254 --> 20:46.616
They're all families of kids.

20:47.017 --> 20:51.421
I was happy to see that.

20:51.441 --> 20:55.405
I know, there are a lot of kids.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.868
But they were in with the kids to look at children's books.

20:58.068 --> 21:02.993
But let's say that that figure of 40% is right, maybe it's 35%, maybe it's

21:03.445 --> 21:04.687
Well, you know, that's not the point.

21:04.747 --> 21:13.600
The point is, for those who say that books and children are anachronisms, that's rather dramatic evidence to the contrary.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.665
I was going to say, there's rather dramatic evidence to the contrary all the time.

21:16.765 --> 21:18.067
Yeah, yeah.

21:19.128 --> 21:21.272
And, you know, I don't know.

21:21.292 --> 21:32.929
My father pioneered in the television industry, and he built some of those early Capehart-Farnsworth sets, and we had TV, you know, right after, literally, out of the war.

21:33.449 --> 21:40.443
there were all those claims then that television would do all these miraculous things, you know, for the education of the math.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.629
Well, yeah, that's what I was going to tell you, history.

21:43.910 --> 21:49.080
But, you know, they're not unlike the claims that are being made for some of the electronic media now, you know.

21:49.301 --> 21:52.487
And I think that sometimes we have to look at things as...

21:53.648 --> 21:56.391
Maybe they will develop some way, but also maybe they won't.

21:56.411 --> 21:58.174
But one thing we know, we know books work.

21:58.354 --> 21:59.395
I mean, that's one thing.

21:59.595 --> 22:01.938
We do know books work in terms of educating children.

22:02.058 --> 22:03.861
I mean, that's quite clear.

22:04.341 --> 22:11.730
Whether the other media will work as well, I don't think we're yet aware, as we were not aware of television when I was growing up.

22:11.750 --> 22:15.054
It was a tactile experience, which I described in my book.

22:15.195 --> 22:15.715
Absolutely.

22:15.735 --> 22:21.242
When I went off to find all these people, and then, you know, starting with William Scheide, who

22:21.593 --> 22:23.455
let me handle this Gutenberg Bible.

22:23.595 --> 22:24.336
Yes, yeah.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.557
I almost fainted.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.078
I know.

22:26.418 --> 22:27.500
Yeah, well, it's the whole thing.

22:27.520 --> 22:34.487
You know, as you know, it's the binding and the end papers and the type and the choices and the paper.

22:34.507 --> 22:35.008
I feel it, really.

22:35.028 --> 22:38.612
It's a beautiful book can really make me pause.

22:38.752 --> 22:39.653
Yes, yeah.

22:39.673 --> 22:41.335
It's a book as physical object.

22:41.415 --> 22:42.476
And it never fails.

22:42.857 --> 22:44.919
And I handle thousands of books a year.

22:44.939 --> 22:47.702
If the book is beautiful, I will drop everything

22:48.155 --> 22:49.958
to pay attention to it.

22:49.978 --> 22:58.970
Well, and didn't you, when you were an author and you finally saw the book Bound, isn't it just, isn't it, yeah, like a thrill that you cannot communicate?

22:59.090 --> 22:59.651
I did, too.

23:00.012 --> 23:00.512
I did, too.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.856
I saw this book and I cried, you know.

23:02.876 --> 23:09.425
In fact, I was on the phone with one of my, one of the papers that takes my piece out in Grand Rapids.

23:09.565 --> 23:10.547
I don't know how to get it.

23:10.567 --> 23:13.330
And my wife came down with the Federal Express.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.893
It's my visitor's page.

23:14.913 --> 23:15.814
Oh, okay.

23:15.834 --> 23:15.934
Yeah.

23:15.954 --> 23:16.575
I don't need it right now.

23:17.365 --> 23:20.589
And I said to the wife, I said, Sue, I've got to call you back.

23:20.669 --> 23:24.192
I mean, I said, my book is here, you know.

23:24.212 --> 23:27.056
That was really, and it's an exquisite dust jacket.

23:27.076 --> 23:31.901
It's got the dura engraving of the book full with the gold border around it.

23:31.921 --> 23:32.842
Yeah, yeah.

23:32.862 --> 23:34.283
And it was a moment.

23:34.344 --> 23:36.326
Isn't it just an incredible moment to see it?

23:36.346 --> 23:42.593
As one who's been writing all my life, all my adult life, you know, I did a piece on Amy Tan just this week.

23:42.613 --> 23:44.875
I was looking at the first one this morning in Worcester.

23:46.002 --> 23:48.845
You know, what it looks like on one of these screens.

23:49.306 --> 23:51.808
And there have been studies, you know, at MIT.

23:52.509 --> 23:59.557
The response to the same words on a manuscript page is different from the response that you see in type.

23:59.677 --> 24:00.558
In type, exactly.

24:00.678 --> 24:03.361
In a printed book or in a newspaper.

24:03.721 --> 24:06.705
And I can't describe how you do that.

24:06.725 --> 24:07.946
I know certain things that I write.

24:07.986 --> 24:12.591
If you read it in the manuscript, my wife always reads my stuff.

24:12.751 --> 24:13.712
I say, trust me.

24:13.732 --> 24:14.473
It'll be fine.

24:14.858 --> 24:18.164
And it will look different, and it will feel different.

24:18.184 --> 24:23.373
And I think what you're describing when you pick up the book, I know there will always be books.

24:23.693 --> 24:24.194
Exactly.

24:24.314 --> 24:33.490
And... I've read typescripts of famous, famous authors of things I've seen, and it's just different.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.251
It's totally different.

24:34.271 --> 24:38.098
Well, even think of... When you see it in the printed book.

24:38.264 --> 24:41.468
For newspapers, I created a magazine for 11 years.

24:41.628 --> 24:42.789
Loved creating a magazine.

24:42.809 --> 24:44.131
There's something quite wonderful about it.

24:44.431 --> 24:46.254
It doesn't feel the same thing as a book.

24:46.274 --> 24:48.677
I mean, it's wonderful to see your words in print.

24:49.037 --> 24:51.260
It's not the same as seeing a bound book.

24:51.280 --> 24:56.586
I have to say the book is a whole experience unto itself.

24:56.606 --> 24:58.368
Yeah, I believe that it is.

24:58.448 --> 25:01.572
And I think that that's some of...

25:02.986 --> 25:30.208
as you said, it's not going to look quite the way, and it's not even in a CD-ROM, you know, and it's not, the other thing that is sometimes important in this, if you can, if something's interactive, you know, then you can create it and you can create it yourself, and there are certain wonderful things about creation, but there's something wonderful about an author's point of view which you cannot alter, you know, I mean, which you must enter into, you know, I mean, that it's not something that you're creating,

25:30.492 --> 25:34.899
It's a world that has been totally created for you that you are walking into.

25:35.019 --> 25:35.640
Exactly.

25:35.660 --> 25:44.733
And I have said often that reading is the only artistic exercise that I can think of where the artist really communes one-on-one.

25:44.833 --> 25:45.094
Yes.

25:45.534 --> 25:46.135
That's what I think.

25:46.155 --> 25:50.121
In every instance, it's between the writer

25:50.641 --> 25:54.967
And I suppose you could say that for a painting, but I don't think so.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.692
Because it's in a room and people are looking at it.

25:58.052 --> 25:58.833
And it's really one.

25:59.054 --> 26:00.476
It's unique.

26:00.496 --> 26:01.157
The painting is unique.

26:01.177 --> 26:03.320
And people are looking at it and they're responding together.

26:04.181 --> 26:06.044
But a book is... That's right.

26:06.144 --> 26:10.431
It's that single communication of one person to one other person reading it.

26:10.451 --> 26:16.920
It's in the same reason why I believe that a parent reading with a child is so special.

26:17.802 --> 26:18.623
Because...

26:18.856 --> 26:38.222
again, it's one-on-one or a family group together, or it's something that's shared in a very intimate way, you know, reading a novel to a couple of children, that sitting children down in front of the television does not... I don't ever remember a single television show I watch with my family.

26:38.302 --> 26:39.103
I can honestly tell.

26:39.143 --> 26:47.935
You know, I never... But I remember things my grandmother read to me that my mother read to... I mean, I have vivid memories, and there's certain poetry...

26:48.235 --> 26:53.682
as I say, that will always have my grandmother and my mother's voice on it because they were the ones who first read it to me.

26:54.063 --> 27:06.739
And so there's even that way in which when it's not just a single person reading a book, there's even that way in which the reader becomes the author of the book when they share it with children or when you share it with an audience.

27:06.759 --> 27:11.325
It's like hearing a poet read their work, you know, if you've sat and listened to an audience.

27:11.405 --> 27:12.707
Now, you mentioned earlier that

27:13.683 --> 27:18.989
the world of adult publishing is an alien planet.

27:19.009 --> 27:20.610
And that's great.

27:20.630 --> 27:28.358
But when you are, as an editor of children's books... No, what I mean by alien planet, I mean, I can't describe it.

27:28.479 --> 27:29.840
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.582
I know exactly what you mean.

27:31.942 --> 27:35.126
When I come to transcribe people, I'll know exactly what you said.

27:35.146 --> 27:36.767
Okay.

27:36.787 --> 27:40.111
But my point is, you have to have a lot of the kid in you.

27:40.371 --> 27:41.372
Yeah.

27:41.472 --> 27:43.234
I think all of us who remain...

27:43.501 --> 27:47.867
In children's publishing, we're very much in touch with the feelings of our own childhood.

27:48.247 --> 27:56.437
We are working with creators who are very much in touch with their own childhood or their children's childhood or their grandchildren's childhood.

27:57.319 --> 28:02.305
And that you never... I always think we have the best of both worlds because we're adults, you know.

28:02.846 --> 28:07.612
But we can still remain true to that child self, too.

28:07.632 --> 28:09.354
That we don't have to put it away.

28:09.434 --> 28:10.575
It's still part of us.

28:10.656 --> 28:11.837
We're still aware of it.

28:12.138 --> 28:31.059
Are you mindful of trends or are there other things that you just feel are universal and you're looking for the... I mean, you mentioned earlier that in a lot of the picture books, there are trends and there are science things or multicultural things or whatever, and you have to do them.

28:31.079 --> 28:34.083
And I really like multicultural things in children's books.

28:34.143 --> 28:36.345
I think that's really the place for them.

28:36.586 --> 28:37.387
Yes, yeah.

28:37.407 --> 28:40.390
If ever there's a place that argues for a book that

28:40.538 --> 28:43.502
That can speak to different children and different realities.

28:43.602 --> 28:50.853
And it allows them to be very proud of whatever cultural that's the place to do it.

28:50.873 --> 28:59.085
And I save these books and collect them, as long as they're not, you know, a little too cynical and a little too exploitive of things.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.306
Right, exactly.

29:00.326 --> 29:02.009
And we see them too, I guess.

29:02.269 --> 29:03.050
Yeah.

29:03.070 --> 29:07.677
Anyway, but do you try to be on the cutting edge of trends, or are you still looking

29:08.197 --> 29:17.508
I think, well, the thing is, I think, you know, you publish and you work in a world, so you're very aware of what's going on.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.170
I mean, certainly I've just come from reviewing.

29:19.291 --> 29:23.876
I saw everything that everyone did, so I'm extraordinarily aware at this time.

29:25.598 --> 29:28.602
But I really believe that what works is better.

29:29.172 --> 29:30.574
Publishing good books.

29:31.135 --> 29:33.659
It's hunting for those things that work.

29:33.679 --> 29:34.901
Publishing good books well.

29:34.921 --> 29:36.063
Well, exactly.

29:36.103 --> 29:39.869
That's really the goal, is to try to publish good books very well.

29:40.250 --> 29:54.994
As someone who thinks a lot about books, sometimes I'm concerned about vacuums, books that aren't there, the kinds of publishing that isn't happening now for children.

29:55.598 --> 30:02.284
found a manuscript in some of those areas, I would be more receptive to it, if you know what I mean, or if I have a concern.

30:02.724 --> 30:13.714
I mean, when I was editor of the Horn book, one of the editorials I wrote several years before multiculturalism came about was, where are the books that represent all of our children?

30:13.734 --> 30:15.376
Because that was a great concern to me.

30:15.416 --> 30:21.501
I mean, I was seeing a quite homogenous world in children's books, and that's not good.

30:21.641 --> 30:23.563
You know, you've got to have a wide range of

30:23.813 --> 30:26.556
childhood experience represented in what's publishing.

30:26.676 --> 30:35.446
So I'm always sort of aware of what's not there, but in the end... And he's, pardon me for interrupting, but any specific things that you feel are being ignored?

30:35.486 --> 30:52.386
I think that right now, as I survey the field, it seems to me that writing for the middle grades, whether it's information books, biography, fiction, that third, fourth, fifth grade reader is just

30:52.703 --> 30:54.185
They're fabulous picture books.

30:54.265 --> 30:56.909
We have some wonderful writing on the young adult level.

30:57.591 --> 31:05.162
But we've sort of forgotten that some of the crucial times in reading come from third, fourth, fifth grade.

31:05.222 --> 31:11.913
And whatever group of books I look at, I don't see enough in that range.

31:11.993 --> 31:14.456
So right now, that's one of my great concerns.

31:14.476 --> 31:15.398
What age group is that?

31:15.418 --> 31:21.327
No, it's probably that, what, 9 to 12, 8 to 11, right around in there.

31:21.543 --> 31:37.886
It seems to be an area, because so much energy started to go to picture books and illustrated non-fiction, very young non-fiction, we don't see a lot of, you know, new writers in that area or new books or new creations.

31:38.206 --> 31:46.418
So I'm concerned about, you know, again, because I'm concerned about providing books for all children, what children are gaining for.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.541
But the marketplace dictates a great deal of that, doesn't it?

31:48.561 --> 31:49.322
Picture books are...

31:49.808 --> 31:51.430
picture books are doing.

31:51.771 --> 31:54.935
And the amazing thing about children's books, I don't think I haven't been alert to this.

31:56.637 --> 31:59.421
I mean, picture books, if they're good, they're around forever.

31:59.701 --> 32:03.226
This book comes back year after year.

32:03.566 --> 32:04.627
Absolutely, yeah.

32:04.647 --> 32:06.610
And not only comes back, but on the bestseller list.

32:06.630 --> 32:08.092
Yeah, exactly.

32:08.112 --> 32:11.677
The first printing for an adult nonfiction book might be 10,000.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.699
A book like this can be 200,000.

32:13.759 --> 32:14.821
Oh, I know.

32:14.941 --> 32:16.162
And that's what you hope.

32:16.182 --> 32:18.145
What you hope is you're publishing something good enough

32:18.327 --> 32:20.089
that it stays year after year after year.

32:20.109 --> 32:22.691
And that certainly is, I would say, I don't know, what is it?

32:22.711 --> 32:23.452
It's 10 years now.

32:23.572 --> 32:24.072
Yes.

32:24.253 --> 32:25.394
Older Express is 10 years.

32:25.414 --> 32:28.036
It has to be close to classic status, would you say?

32:28.176 --> 32:28.877
Oh, yeah.

32:28.917 --> 32:32.080
When I was at Hornbrook, we were just pulling together a list of classics.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.201
We were publishing it for parents.

32:33.221 --> 32:33.642
It's in the works.

32:33.662 --> 32:46.714
But yes, we included a few titles from maybe the last 10 years, you know, the 10 or 15 years that we would put on that list of Older Express.

32:47.909 --> 32:48.850
the subsequent part of the book.

32:51.434 --> 32:57.844
There must be a dozen things that she left that you felt... Oh, that couldn't be included in the book?

32:57.864 --> 33:00.689
Oh, yeah, that's what was always the hardest.

33:00.709 --> 33:08.941
I could have really done a book of 1,600 pages, and I would have been, you know, if you love books, you know, there were just so many authors I couldn't include, and illustrators.

33:08.961 --> 33:11.105
Do you realize now what you've probably done for collectors now?

33:11.125 --> 33:12.967
Collectors are going to try and get every book on their list.

33:12.987 --> 33:13.328
Oh, really?

33:13.388 --> 33:14.289
I'd never thought of that.

33:14.410 --> 33:15.351
Yeah, yeah.

33:15.331 --> 33:18.355
My good friend Bob Corby is in there.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.716
Oh, of course he's there.

33:19.937 --> 33:20.698
Listen, he is.

33:20.778 --> 33:21.499
Isn't he wonderful?

33:21.519 --> 33:22.620
He's the best, you know.

33:22.660 --> 33:28.307
I mean, he really, you know, defined the young adult genre of books for us.

33:28.527 --> 33:29.749
Can you give me a quote on that?

33:29.809 --> 33:30.069
Sure.

33:30.149 --> 33:33.914
Because I might do an interview for my newspapers who have not seen who write about it.

33:33.934 --> 33:36.157
Okay, yeah, absolutely.

33:38.379 --> 33:44.747
And I think it may even be in the young adult essay in here, but there had been a couple of books

33:44.997 --> 34:12.928
both published for adults, Lord of the Flies and Catcher in the Rye, which by and large totally worked with an adolescent, obviously adolescent reader, but nothing had really been created totally for that adolescent reader, I think, until The Chocolate War was the great breakthrough in publishing in the early 1970s.

34:16.233 --> 34:28.693
At that point, other writers, just because of the sheer artistry of what Bob Cormier did in that book, other writers became attracted to it as a genre, and the whole young adult field developed.

34:29.655 --> 34:41.093
And what's exciting about Bob, of course, is that he did that fabulous book in early 1970s and continues to write these absolutely chilling novels that work

34:41.410 --> 34:45.917
so well with young adults, and he does it... And he writes it down, and he talks about themes.

34:46.177 --> 34:52.746
Oh, talks about, and that are important, and, you know, and yet what he can do, he's a fine, fine storyteller.

34:52.807 --> 34:59.216
I mean, it always works with plot and character, and that he's continued to do just book after book after book.

34:59.356 --> 35:06.887
He's, as you know, the nicest human being of the world, among other things, you know, but he's just such a talented creator.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.329
I hadn't seen him for a while, and

35:08.832 --> 35:17.245
We were both out at the ABA, and I just ran into him at the airport, and we talked, you know, a little bit of a fact, and I talked for the longest time.

35:17.265 --> 35:18.207
His wife, Connie.

35:18.427 --> 35:19.429
Oh, I know, aren't they?

35:19.529 --> 35:19.970
I know.

35:21.292 --> 35:26.881
But you think of his books, they're really almost totally unknown to adults.

35:27.382 --> 35:30.186
And I say, you know, read one of these books.

35:30.226 --> 35:33.912
Don't think that you're going to be, you know, amusing yourself with something

35:34.229 --> 35:35.150
Yeah.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.253
Irrelevant exercise.

35:37.614 --> 35:52.776
I often, sometimes when adults ask me, why do you do this insane thing, be it children's books, Anita, you're such a sophisticated adult, I always give them, I am the cheese, Bob Cormier's, I am the cheese, and I give them Natalie Babbitt's Talk Everlasting to read.

35:53.317 --> 35:57.483
And inevitably, they come back to me and say, this is really spectacular.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.287
I mean, these are really superb books.

36:00.790 --> 36:03.475
books, are there any more of them, you know?

36:03.495 --> 36:08.002
So I always think that those are two books that are quite wonderful to win over, you know?

36:08.023 --> 36:13.332
And I would give them now Lois Lowry's The Giver, too, because I think that's another book that adults can respond to.

36:13.352 --> 36:15.996
I remember when I read it after the first death, I was so upset.

36:16.016 --> 36:19.222
I mean, to the point where I wrote him, I said, why did you have to kill this child?

36:19.482 --> 36:20.624
And this is sufficient.

36:21.506 --> 36:23.549
Did you have to do this?

36:23.569 --> 36:25.633
Well, you know, and that book's phenomenal because

36:25.917 --> 36:29.301
he really gets you to understand the mind of a terrorist.

36:29.421 --> 36:40.472
You know, and I mean, that is not a mind that I can easily understand, and yet somehow or another he makes that... But he really evoked a visceral response, which is what a writer is supposed to do.

36:40.492 --> 36:41.013
Always, yeah.

36:41.033 --> 36:44.937
So he succeeded brilliantly, and I remember being upset and saying, oh no, you didn't kill us.

36:45.658 --> 36:48.661
He didn't kill, but I mean, he allowed this child to, you know... To die.

36:48.781 --> 36:49.422
To die.

36:49.942 --> 36:53.646
And that's supposed to break every taboo in writing, and that's supposed to...

36:54.031 --> 36:56.315
kill children and animals, you know.

36:56.455 --> 36:57.457
I know, I know.

36:57.517 --> 37:00.161
Thank goodness he doesn't write to what he's supposed to write.

37:00.201 --> 37:04.588
He just writes, you know, and that's what, I mean, he writes to tell the story that has to be told.

37:04.969 --> 37:14.665
I read a comment from you about the golden age of, you felt, you feel that we are in a golden age of children's books, or is it illustrated children's books?

37:14.685 --> 37:20.815
Well, illustration, yeah, I think there's no doubt that what we're seeing in terms of illustration in art is quite extraordinary.

37:21.200 --> 37:29.328
And I would certainly call it, you know, it's one of our great Renaissance periods in children's books in that way.

37:29.388 --> 37:34.052
There's a tremendous amount of vitality right now in the children's book field.

37:34.112 --> 37:39.497
There are a lot of new writers, new creators, people trying different things.

37:41.259 --> 37:48.085
Lane Smith and John Cheska, you know, being examples of quite innovative and new creators.

37:48.925 --> 37:54.394
But I've always thought it's always been a wonderful time to be in children's books, because it's children's books.

37:55.075 --> 37:57.038
I mean, there just isn't a bad time for me.

37:57.098 --> 38:04.750
I've seen it when there have been a lot of books published and when there have been few books published.

38:04.790 --> 38:11.440
But what is remarkable to me is that every year there are just these gems that emerge.

38:11.858 --> 38:16.304
any parent or any teacher would love to share with children.

38:16.545 --> 38:24.336
And whether there are 2,000 books published or 5,000 books published, you know, there are always that cream that rises that is just so fine.

38:24.476 --> 38:33.670
What's amazing about children's books is that, unlike adult trade, a book will be issued, the publication date will be whatever, and you'll get that one.

38:34.090 --> 38:37.275
I notice the books I request from the publishers, they come

38:37.711 --> 38:46.282
When they arrive, UPS, and my wife and I do the children's books together, I have to say.

38:46.963 --> 38:54.793
In fact, I let her do the first screening, and she would do the initial evaluations, and then working together, I'll write it.

38:55.614 --> 38:57.076
But what a day then.

38:57.237 --> 39:00.681
They never fail to surprise and to move.

39:00.965 --> 39:04.189
You say, well, how many themes can they do over and over again?

39:04.209 --> 39:05.110
But that's the beauty, isn't it?

39:05.250 --> 39:05.550
I know.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.274
And I suppose in sitting where you sit, that's what you're looking for all the time.

39:09.294 --> 39:10.596
That's exactly what you're looking for.

39:10.696 --> 39:11.577
You know, all the time.

39:11.617 --> 39:12.097
The magic.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.739
Yeah, all that time you're looking for that magic.

39:13.759 --> 39:17.143
You know, you're looking for that manuscript that sends a shiver down your back.

39:17.163 --> 39:20.987
You know, that art that you look at and think, this is so beautiful.

39:21.047 --> 39:25.973
You know, what a... That's the exciting thing about being on this side of the process, again.

39:26.013 --> 39:28.255
I might just talk briefly about that, going from...

39:28.808 --> 39:36.898
the reviewing side of the process, which you did for eleven years, and now to the creative side, I guess.

39:37.599 --> 39:38.840
Is there a climate?

39:39.220 --> 39:43.145
I mean, is this a return for you, or a progression?

39:43.165 --> 39:45.888
Well, I was at Houghton before.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.971
I was here before, yeah.

39:48.512 --> 39:58.123
And I always, it's funny, I've always divided my career between reviewing and publishing.

39:58.357 --> 40:05.185
That great quote in Alan Say's grandfather's journey, the moment I'm in one country, I long for the other.

40:05.566 --> 40:19.082
It's wonderful when you're a reviewer because you see everything, but you're just one step away from actually being able to decide that this book will be published and how it will be published and what you can do with it.

40:19.535 --> 40:23.079
And that's such a wonderful part of the process.

40:23.119 --> 40:27.004
So for me, it was coming back to that process, which I'd missed a lot.

40:27.024 --> 40:31.750
And just for the record, I think Houghton, how many children's books did I do a year?

40:31.770 --> 40:32.471
They do something.

40:32.531 --> 40:36.896
I think there's the Clarion List, Walter Lorraine Books, and Houghton.

40:36.936 --> 40:40.241
So that's about maybe 100, 125, around in there.

40:40.681 --> 40:44.466
Yeah, it's a good-sized list, yes, at this point.

40:44.486 --> 40:45.227
So this is quite nice.

40:45.247 --> 40:46.268
I mean, this is one of the premier books.

40:46.535 --> 40:49.580
It's one of the great lists.

40:49.741 --> 40:50.963
It's one of the great back lists.

40:51.063 --> 41:01.301
You literally start with Curious Georgian about the department was formed somewhere in the 1930s that not definitely formed and then eventually was by the end of the 30s.

41:02.222 --> 41:07.311
And it is consistently produced, just one

41:07.696 --> 41:10.439
one classic children's book after another, one fine book after another.

41:10.479 --> 41:12.542
But, of course, that establishes a standard.

41:12.562 --> 41:13.703
That's right, exactly.

41:13.723 --> 41:15.225
You can't go below that.

41:15.405 --> 41:15.626
No.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.249
The bar is very high.

41:19.150 --> 41:22.213
And that's who would want anything else.

41:22.233 --> 41:23.135
Who would want it any other way?

41:23.155 --> 41:25.838
And that's why I mentioned these Shaw's supermarket things.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.382
Boy, you know, stick to produce.

41:30.423 --> 41:33.087
Let the professionals do it.

41:33.107 --> 41:34.328
Don't mess.

41:35.405 --> 41:37.568
Literacy is a fundamental concern, isn't it?

41:37.608 --> 41:37.988
Yes.

41:38.008 --> 41:41.332
I also read that you had expected once to be a teacher.

41:41.592 --> 41:44.576
Yes, I trained to be a teacher, and I thought I was going to do that.

41:44.816 --> 41:51.024
And I got my master's degree at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and came to Boston right after that.

41:51.224 --> 41:51.524
You know what?

41:51.544 --> 41:52.405
He takes my stuff.

41:52.425 --> 41:53.867
Oh, yeah.

41:53.927 --> 41:55.049
That's the collection there.

41:55.069 --> 41:57.411
And I've been on the stage in the Wisconsin State Journal.

41:57.472 --> 41:57.732
Yes.

41:59.214 --> 42:04.900
I'll be mindful of placing, of putting that information in the piece.

42:04.961 --> 42:05.361
Yeah, yeah.

42:05.611 --> 42:17.249
It was 1970, there were too many teachers at that point, and I knew someone through a friend at Little Brown, and he said, well, why don't you think of coming into publishing?

42:17.310 --> 42:26.404
It never occurred to me, but there was an opening in the children's book department, and I literally thought, well, if I can't teach children, why not work on books for them?

42:26.840 --> 42:27.481
Oh, yeah.

42:27.501 --> 42:34.568
Oh, no, and I've never, and needless to say, the minute I found it, I mean, the minute I found it, it was, I should have done it, you know, I should have known all my life.

42:34.768 --> 42:38.773
Well, I read also that you described yourself as a book appreciator, and I like that.

42:38.793 --> 42:40.775
Yeah, yeah.

42:40.795 --> 42:43.278
A praise singer, I guess you call it.

42:43.298 --> 42:46.361
I like that even more.

42:46.381 --> 42:50.926
But I guess this was in context with the question, have you ever thought yourself about doing a children's book?

42:51.727 --> 42:55.851
No, not a children's book, because my mind...

42:58.868 --> 42:59.951
doesn't work that way.

43:00.211 --> 43:06.306
It's a different kind of talent, and I'm very respectful of that talent.

43:06.507 --> 43:11.038
You know, it's a unique ability, and

43:11.255 --> 43:14.599
I could write about, as I did here, a children's book for adults.

43:14.639 --> 43:16.181
You know, I can certainly do that.

43:16.421 --> 43:17.442
But you're describing it.

43:17.462 --> 43:19.144
Because I'm describing it, and I'm doing it again.

43:19.164 --> 43:19.985
It's a work of criticism.

43:20.005 --> 43:21.167
Yeah, it's a work of criticism.

43:21.227 --> 43:22.708
I can do that, that part.

43:23.149 --> 43:25.031
But it is, it's very different.

43:25.732 --> 43:29.276
The creative process of people who can create is very different.

43:29.316 --> 43:33.701
My editor at Holt, Alan Peacock, who's the main writer, is terrific.

43:33.721 --> 43:35.464
Yes, yes, I certainly have.

43:35.484 --> 43:38.427
And he said something recently, he said, well,

43:38.626 --> 43:40.950
the novel I probably will never write.

43:40.970 --> 43:43.795
I said, oh, you know more about fiction than anybody.

43:43.856 --> 43:44.897
I mean, look at your office.

43:44.978 --> 43:47.262
It's more for what surprises and this and that.

43:47.282 --> 43:47.622
Yeah.

43:47.943 --> 43:49.826
No, this is a different thing.

43:49.907 --> 43:50.247
It is.

43:50.428 --> 43:51.790
It's a different thing altogether.

43:52.031 --> 43:53.513
And it's exactly what you're saying.

43:53.533 --> 43:54.094
Yeah, it is.

43:54.435 --> 43:55.557
It's a different ability.

43:55.837 --> 43:58.322
And I'm just so

43:58.741 --> 44:01.665
you know, in awe of people who have that ability.

44:01.685 --> 44:06.371
I mean, that drawing there, that's one that Alan, say, created for me for the cover of the Horn book.

44:07.232 --> 44:13.100
Isn't it, I mean, again, you know, just that ability to create that kind of image.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.664
Yeah, or to write the text that goes with it, you know.

44:17.405 --> 44:18.547
Yes, absolutely.

44:18.607 --> 44:19.388
Yeah, yeah.

44:19.948 --> 44:25.395
So, no, I don't have it, but I certainly am grateful that there are people who do.

44:25.916 --> 44:27.398
There's also a line you used

44:28.289 --> 44:39.024
And I have to say, I was signing at Neva a couple weeks ago, and the booksellers love my book, because it's a celebration of books.

44:39.725 --> 44:45.954
And so one woman came up and she said to the bookseller, I'm a bibliotherapist.

44:45.974 --> 44:48.517
So that's the first time I've heard the phrase.

44:48.537 --> 44:49.238
And I said, really?

44:49.258 --> 44:50.400
I said, that's kind of nice.

44:51.221 --> 44:51.882
I said, what do you do?

44:51.902 --> 44:55.647
And she says, well, people come in to my store, and they tell me

44:55.998 --> 44:59.662
what they're interested in, and I prescribe your book.

45:00.784 --> 45:04.488
Give me a couple seconds with this inscription.

45:05.089 --> 45:06.671
Well, that's a different way.

45:07.392 --> 45:08.153
Bingo!

45:08.593 --> 45:13.699
That's a little different vision of bibliotherapy than I talk about.

45:14.180 --> 45:17.784
But tell me about what the word means to you.

45:17.804 --> 45:24.452
Well, bibliotherapy is, I believe, a kind of reductive view of children's books, which is you take

45:24.820 --> 45:34.677
a problem that a child might have, such as divorce, and you write around that problem, and therefore you believe that book will help that child.

45:35.739 --> 45:45.276
In reality, what we find from children's reading is that books may help them tremendously with emotional things.

45:45.678 --> 45:49.726
but not necessarily a book written to the specific problem that they have.

45:49.766 --> 45:52.011
Again, it's a reductive view of children's reading.

45:52.071 --> 46:01.389
If I describe this, if I give them a therapeutic solution to their problem, they'll read that, and then they won't be feeling the same way.

46:01.850 --> 46:07.922
And that children, from best I can tell, that may not be the book

46:08.138 --> 46:10.862
that helps them, although there may be a book that's very, very different.

46:11.263 --> 46:13.686
You know, a good story, a good survival story.

46:13.706 --> 46:15.689
There are all kinds of things that they might respond to.

46:15.709 --> 46:18.834
Is this a word that you... No, no, it's a common word in the profession.

46:18.854 --> 46:19.235
Really?

46:19.355 --> 46:20.176
Yeah, it's a common word.

46:20.196 --> 46:22.239
And did you basically just define it for me?

46:22.259 --> 46:23.561
I will use it in this piece.

46:23.601 --> 46:24.242
Yes, basically.

46:24.262 --> 46:27.227
I'd like to give it some... Okay, some basic definition.

46:27.287 --> 46:30.111
Yeah, I would suppose that I basically defined it.

46:30.171 --> 46:34.838
It's that sense that a book can be written to a topic, and it will...

46:35.223 --> 46:41.151
it will deal with the topic and therefore help the child with that particular problem.

46:41.171 --> 46:48.421
And some of those books are better than others, you know, but by and large, they are not the ones that stand the test of time.

46:48.602 --> 46:59.877
Beyond that wonderful function, there's still that timeless element of awe and wonder and magic.

46:59.978 --> 47:02.481
And that is almost ineffable, isn't it?

47:02.501 --> 47:03.222
You can't really

47:03.421 --> 47:04.542
You know it when you see it.

47:04.562 --> 47:05.643
You know it when you see it.

47:05.744 --> 47:06.885
You can't define it.

47:07.445 --> 47:11.430
And, yes, and that's, of course, part of what makes a classic.

47:11.470 --> 47:23.904
It is that wonder and that magic and that awe and just that sense of recognition that comes when you're in a story that, you know, speaks to you at some very, very deep level.

47:23.924 --> 47:27.548
My older daughter was just the other night was asking me if she'd seen something in the news.

47:27.668 --> 47:31.192
She said, Dad, what's the difference between pornography and erotica?

47:31.212 --> 47:31.352
Mm-hmm.

47:32.429 --> 47:34.252
That's a pretty good question.

47:35.253 --> 47:40.522
I said, I think one of the court decisions was, you know when you see it.

47:40.542 --> 47:41.704
One is really, really bad.

47:41.944 --> 47:48.274
I think we've got a lot of stuff.

47:48.374 --> 47:49.656
Okay, all right.

47:50.037 --> 47:51.739
That should be, if that's fine.

47:51.780 --> 47:57.188
Yeah, okay.
