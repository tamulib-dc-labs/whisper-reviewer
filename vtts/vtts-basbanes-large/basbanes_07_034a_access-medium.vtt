WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:18.648
And you say, seven years ago you brought a facsimile of this, never expecting that you'd get the actual copy.

00:18.888 --> 00:22.032
This is an actual copy.

00:22.953 --> 00:28.519
It is not as good condition as the Bible, but beggars can't be choosers.

00:29.478 --> 00:31.460
And nobody else had it in this country.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.581
And this is something you acquired?

00:32.762 --> 00:34.644
Yes, I got it in 1971.

00:36.225 --> 00:36.646
There.

00:36.666 --> 00:40.410
Now, you can see how the initials are reversed in color.

00:43.313 --> 00:44.675
Otherwise, it's pretty much the same.

00:44.715 --> 00:46.376
This is trimmed, obviously, a little bit.

00:46.457 --> 00:47.117
Is that trimmed?

00:47.137 --> 00:48.699
Oh, of course, yes, yes, there's no doubt about it.

00:49.420 --> 00:50.901
It's trimmed very radically.

00:51.042 --> 00:57.008
It's bound by the Nouvelle-Élysée-Nassonale in about 1820 or something like that, I suppose.

00:57.028 --> 00:58.810
The Nouvelle-Élysée-Nassonale found it.

00:59.785 --> 01:03.529
Oh, I think that's an early 19th century French finding.

01:03.549 --> 01:07.853
I could imagine.

01:07.873 --> 01:08.493
It's probably possible.

01:08.533 --> 01:09.034
Now, wait a minute.

01:09.054 --> 01:09.634
We have to.

01:10.195 --> 01:10.735
Could you open that?

01:10.775 --> 01:17.962
There's a guide there, the pages I'm supposed to show.

01:18.342 --> 01:24.068
The trick is that your pages are different from the two copies, and that can be done.

01:24.108 --> 01:26.530
From the facsimile?

01:26.550 --> 01:29.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.153 --> 01:29.573
Now, let's see.

01:30.683 --> 01:36.430
Well, the facsimile is from... You could do me a favor if you move over there.

01:40.155 --> 01:41.016
Okay.

01:41.036 --> 01:43.559
Yes, sir.

01:44.740 --> 01:49.647
You turn these pages to 3D.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.108
That's right.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.956
It's quite a nice facsimile, isn't it?

01:56.976 --> 01:58.918
It's a very nice facsimile.

02:00.383 --> 02:05.249
Well, how about that?

02:05.349 --> 02:06.150
Can you find it?

02:10.956 --> 02:29.918
What that means is that this sort of stuff is directions for certain usages in different places, and probably places around Mainz, I suppose, that they were familiar with.

02:30.488 --> 02:35.533
And then somebody had the idea, well, listen, if you do that, you won't be able to sell it to anybody else.

02:35.854 --> 02:38.136
You just leave that blank and make it put in whatever they want to.

02:39.037 --> 02:39.778
And so they did.

02:39.818 --> 02:41.079
They printed two versions of it.

02:41.800 --> 02:51.390
And what mostly happened is when somebody bought one of those versions, they then put in their—wrote in there.

02:52.591 --> 02:58.217
And all the British copies in the British Library and Winter Castle and Rylance Library

02:58.687 --> 03:00.489
have writing in places like that.

03:00.509 --> 03:00.649
I see.

03:00.669 --> 03:02.812
It's pretty much the same sort of thing.

03:03.713 --> 03:05.034
But this is the print.

03:05.094 --> 03:14.825
And this type, this is a small solar type, is probably the oldest one of the types, because it doesn't have as many different abutting forms.

03:17.729 --> 03:27.900
Look, well, this CI in the first page here, where it says up there,

03:28.184 --> 03:37.256
That eye runs in the sea awkwardly, in a wrong kind of way, and they're having trouble with it.

03:37.276 --> 03:39.119
What is that stuff up there that we don't have here?

03:39.139 --> 03:40.961
That's music, that's it.

03:41.502 --> 03:42.203
That's written in.

03:42.263 --> 03:46.809
This is before they actually figured out how to print music, I think.

03:46.849 --> 03:50.614
There was no music printing in 1457, no.

03:51.255 --> 03:53.398
But this type shows features

03:53.851 --> 03:56.335
that suggests that it may be earlier.

03:56.435 --> 04:01.222
It's the same type as in the Morgan's Conscience Missile.

04:02.143 --> 04:06.009
It finally wasn't printed until about 1472, according to Watermark.

04:06.349 --> 04:13.700
But the type may be very old, and it may be older than not only the 42-line type, but even the 36-line type.

04:13.740 --> 04:14.721
Really?

04:14.741 --> 04:15.162
Mm-hmm.

04:15.182 --> 04:16.744
I have a feeling that that's the oldest one.

04:19.869 --> 04:22.052
Now, where did you find this property?

04:22.437 --> 04:29.847
Well, Mr. Kraus did a bargaining job with Bibliothic National.

04:30.708 --> 04:32.570
Did Bibliothic National let this go?

04:33.311 --> 04:34.072
Let this go, yes.

04:34.893 --> 04:47.650
And Mr. Halbren, Gabe Austin's father-in-law, the book dealer in Paris, said, oh, did I hear you about that?

04:48.311 --> 04:49.052
I thought to myself,

04:49.201 --> 04:52.107
Another Trafalgar, another Waterloo.

04:52.888 --> 04:57.297
But when I saw the manuscripts we got in exchange for, he said, oh, it's not so bad after all.

04:57.317 --> 04:59.020
So you made a little deal then?

04:59.040 --> 05:01.826
You made a little... Not with Mr. Krause.

05:02.106 --> 05:03.649
So he was the broker, so that's true.

05:04.220 --> 05:08.905
Well, he got it before he had any idea who he was going to store it, too.

05:09.285 --> 05:10.847
It lay around in shop for over a year.

05:10.907 --> 05:12.008
Amazing.

05:12.068 --> 05:16.232
Yeah, but he traded something that he had in general stock with them for this?

05:16.592 --> 05:18.954
Whether he had it in general stock, I cannot say.

05:18.975 --> 05:20.396
Do you know what the manuscripts were?

05:20.756 --> 05:21.077
No.

05:22.638 --> 05:29.365
Nicholas Parker's written that all up, and also it's in his book, his autobiography, as well.

05:30.105 --> 05:30.346
I see.

05:30.406 --> 05:32.708
I forgot what the manuscripts were.

05:33.177 --> 05:35.600
The book's here, you know.

05:36.741 --> 05:37.261
Okay, Crouse.

05:37.321 --> 05:38.382
Now, the next page.

05:40.064 --> 05:41.466
Let's try 15A.

05:41.746 --> 05:47.212
That's quite a thing that Crouse pulled out.

05:48.293 --> 05:50.215
You couldn't do that today, could you, I don't think.

05:50.575 --> 05:55.180
Oh, I haven't heard about it.

05:56.722 --> 05:57.743
Oh, yeah, 15A.

05:57.763 --> 05:58.904
15, or 16A.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.728
Yeah, she allowed a...

06:02.978 --> 06:08.685
I think that's just a drop of wine, a drop of word, or what?

06:08.705 --> 06:09.966
Yeah, it wasn't there.

06:10.827 --> 06:11.788
I don't know.

06:11.828 --> 06:13.250
Maybe the word fell out of it.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.433
Maybe it's excellent.

06:16.053 --> 06:16.854
That happens.

06:18.316 --> 06:19.297
It's definitely art.

06:22.441 --> 06:24.583
It's there, there, and not there.

06:24.864 --> 06:25.965
That's absolutely correct.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.415
Is it identical as the rest of the page?

06:28.515 --> 06:29.276
I think so.

06:29.336 --> 06:30.157
Something in 6A.

06:30.257 --> 06:30.818
I'm sorry.

06:30.838 --> 06:31.499
I didn't see it.

06:31.519 --> 06:32.860
I kept finding new things.

06:32.880 --> 06:33.601
I didn't write them in.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.985
Where is 6A?

06:37.005 --> 06:38.307
I'll tell 6A when I see one.

06:40.789 --> 06:41.050
Yes.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.091
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

06:42.111 --> 06:46.135
This is all I think.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.120
This is 6A.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.702
There, I think.

06:51.722 --> 06:51.902
Oh, yeah.

06:53.924 --> 06:54.585
That's right.

06:54.785 --> 07:00.491
You see, this is wrong, and somebody's corrected it.

07:00.652 --> 07:01.653
All right.

07:01.673 --> 07:04.716
Now, let's go to 19B.

07:05.197 --> 07:08.260
So which one would this have been copied from, or is this a collation, do you think?

07:08.941 --> 07:13.506
No, this would have been copied in Austria, in Vienna, the Austrian National Library.

07:14.607 --> 07:16.249
I've seen the original there.

07:16.850 --> 07:21.275
19B, I think it is.

07:21.295 --> 07:22.876
It should be right.

07:22.897 --> 07:23.357
It's 19B.

07:24.856 --> 07:26.298
Good.

07:26.918 --> 07:28.921
Now, we're looking at, try that there.

07:29.601 --> 07:32.465
Oh, that's inverted, isn't it?

07:32.545 --> 07:33.546
It's a U, see, look.

07:34.907 --> 07:35.868
Monified Latin word.

07:37.931 --> 07:40.894
So, that's right, and this is wrong.

07:42.115 --> 07:44.238
That statement is correct.

07:44.478 --> 07:50.425
It's wonderful, huh?

07:50.445 --> 07:52.727
Very nice to eat.

07:52.747 --> 07:53.428
You found these?

07:53.712 --> 07:57.497
No, there's a book about it that mentions these things, most of them anyway.

07:58.639 --> 07:59.060
And I read the book.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.022
The rest of them had lots of fun just going in.

08:01.243 --> 08:02.344
Oh, sure, you bet.

08:02.364 --> 08:04.507
I had a lot of fun in this book.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.711
This is my favorite book, actually.

08:06.731 --> 08:09.735
My next one is... It's your favorite book, why would you say?

08:09.915 --> 08:10.536
In the library.

08:10.896 --> 08:12.238
Why, though?

08:12.319 --> 08:15.002
Well, it's a majestic, wonderful book.

08:15.964 --> 08:17.225
There's no other copy in this country.

08:17.947 --> 08:20.670
It's the first book that has a complete copy.

08:21.171 --> 08:21.812
It has a beat in it.

08:22.180 --> 08:23.081
And you got it, too.

08:23.481 --> 08:24.402
You're the one who found it.

08:24.822 --> 08:30.367
No, I would have bought it anyway.

08:30.387 --> 08:32.389
I won't go for your next.

08:32.509 --> 08:33.751
27B.

08:35.192 --> 08:36.093
Let's try 27.

08:36.553 --> 08:38.455
Let's do 24.

08:38.475 --> 08:41.998
Come on.

08:42.018 --> 08:49.605
Oh, God, I'm going to stop this in.

08:50.058 --> 08:51.680
Tell me when, by the way.

08:51.820 --> 08:52.641
I can't remember now.

08:52.661 --> 08:52.841
Here.

08:53.362 --> 08:53.662
Oh, yeah.

08:53.682 --> 08:54.343
This is a funny one.

08:54.523 --> 08:56.926
Now, you put your finger on those two places.

08:57.506 --> 08:58.488
That one and the other one.

08:58.528 --> 09:00.530
Down here.

09:00.570 --> 09:03.173
See, they're reversed, if you look very carefully.

09:05.235 --> 09:07.257
And the Dez Deos?

09:08.098 --> 09:10.982
The Dominicus and the Periatis and so on.

09:11.002 --> 09:12.183
That should be down here.

09:12.243 --> 09:13.264
Which is correct, do you think?

09:15.086 --> 09:16.588
I think it's this one, because

09:16.940 --> 09:21.205
Here's two of them in a row, and somebody said that you shouldn't have them in a row.

09:21.245 --> 09:21.966
They should automate.

09:23.327 --> 09:26.331
And if the pattern has been consistent, this book has been corrected.

09:27.252 --> 09:32.778
In other words... No, that's not entirely... Did this one have the I turned into an A?

09:33.218 --> 09:35.020
Yes, it did.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.483
When do you think of... Which of these do you think is earlier?

09:38.084 --> 09:40.927
Well, different pages, of course, could have... You see, that's the problem.

09:40.947 --> 09:45.192
I was going to try and make the case that this one was later and therefore corrected, but you can't...

09:45.442 --> 09:46.363
Always say that.

09:46.423 --> 09:47.665
Because we're just here.

09:48.246 --> 09:51.111
Now, look, for example, here.

09:51.491 --> 09:51.892
See this.

09:53.094 --> 09:56.899
Solvum fac and fiat pox, I think it is.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.084
Oh, no, it isn't.

10:00.104 --> 10:03.049
No, it's fiat media accordia and sacerdotes.

10:03.069 --> 10:03.750
Yes, all right.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.192
Keep your eye on that.

10:05.212 --> 10:09.759
You tell you're getting into suspicious, shiny territory when he starts to number things like this.

10:09.779 --> 10:11.562
Oh, yeah, that's right.

10:11.822 --> 10:13.845
All right, but you're noticing that.

10:14.332 --> 10:15.573
All right, now notice over here.

10:15.613 --> 10:20.979
See, there's a correction there.

10:20.999 --> 10:23.181
They tried to make a turn to turn them around.

10:23.201 --> 10:25.724
I can actually see that there's been some business going on there.

10:25.764 --> 10:27.005
Sure, they've been trying to correct it.

10:27.025 --> 10:27.386
Yeah.

10:27.966 --> 10:35.574
Now, you see what the poor printers had to do, between every copy, they'd have to take out every one of these letters and put them back in.

10:35.734 --> 10:37.136
Once in a while, they'd get them in the wrong order.

10:37.797 --> 10:39.018
And they got these two in the wrong order.

10:39.438 --> 10:43.302
I wouldn't blame them, I bet.

10:43.322 --> 10:43.883
This is...

10:44.521 --> 10:45.582
That's a vellum copy.

10:45.663 --> 10:46.924
Vellum, yes.

10:46.944 --> 10:47.245
Oh, yes.

10:47.665 --> 10:50.549
So is that, but not the facsimile, the original.

10:51.511 --> 10:54.135
Now, where is it?

10:54.155 --> 10:55.737
All right.

10:55.757 --> 10:56.097
It's 28.

10:56.117 --> 10:56.978
This is 28.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.220
Is that all his head ready?

10:59.963 --> 11:01.605
And now, over here, there's something funny, too.

11:03.147 --> 11:03.948
Not in this copy.

11:05.190 --> 11:14.443
Up here, you see, it says, Sani et salvi et libri.

11:15.470 --> 11:18.453
cleanse and heal and free.

11:21.076 --> 11:30.447
Then down here, it says, it says, salva nos ad uva nos.

11:31.749 --> 11:32.490
A couple of noses.

11:33.831 --> 11:34.532
Look over here, see?

11:34.932 --> 11:36.294
Sani salvi et liberi.

11:36.955 --> 11:38.216
Salva ad ad uva nos.

11:38.316 --> 11:40.359
They had dropped red there.

11:40.379 --> 11:41.420
Yeah, they reached it.

11:41.440 --> 11:41.961
They just turned out.

11:41.981 --> 11:42.902
Well, do you think they did it?

11:42.922 --> 11:45.004
Or do you think it could have dropped out in tight?

11:45.136 --> 11:49.722
Well, I think it's been removed.

11:49.742 --> 11:50.383
Pretty good job.

11:50.523 --> 11:51.464
But how is it correct?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.327
Is it correct like that or is it correct like that?

11:53.367 --> 11:54.929
Well, it's the same text.

11:54.949 --> 11:56.491
You see the same format.

11:56.671 --> 11:57.832
There's just enough room for it.

11:58.193 --> 11:58.694
You know what I mean?

11:58.734 --> 12:00.115
Texturally, which is correct?

12:01.377 --> 12:06.604
Yeah, but then you can... It's what Abbott likes against another Abbott.

12:06.624 --> 12:09.928
It's one prison opinion against somebody else's, I suppose.

12:11.157 --> 12:12.619
That was the wrong question.

12:14.041 --> 12:20.030
Now, the British Library copy has many of those things.

12:20.411 --> 12:22.774
The Library of Congress does not have one of these.

12:23.195 --> 12:24.777
No, they're in this country, as I told you.

12:24.797 --> 12:25.238
Okay.

12:25.358 --> 12:26.880
Morgan doesn't have one.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.042
Huntington doesn't have one.

12:28.062 --> 12:31.247
Not even Houghton.

12:31.547 --> 12:32.088
Not even.

12:32.589 --> 12:36.695
Yeah, those are him writing in there.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.679
So, obviously, there was a—

12:40.098 --> 12:40.919
He's going through.

12:40.999 --> 12:57.244
I mean, one thing that he does, and I've learned this, is when somebody writes something about something like Paul Needham or whoever wrote this thing on the phone, he goes through and compares his copy to what they say in the article and checks all of them.

12:57.265 --> 13:05.497
I mean, Paul Needham on where things happen in the Gutenberg spot immediately brings in the article and goes to the pages and finds it, and that's what's going on.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.320
And that's so he can find them again when he...

13:08.532 --> 13:09.593
Try to, anyway.

13:09.613 --> 13:10.494
I think 34B.

13:10.534 --> 13:12.036
34B.

13:12.497 --> 13:13.378
Where's 34?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.663
There's a small one here.

13:17.703 --> 13:20.587
And then there'll be a good one.

13:22.249 --> 13:24.392
I've known I'm him.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.094
See it?

13:27.295 --> 13:28.297
That's a different set.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.659
All right, now we get a good one.

13:30.679 --> 13:30.760
41A.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.823
Look at this.

13:34.004 --> 13:34.724
Somebody here.

13:34.745 --> 13:35.125
Yeah, that's right.

13:35.145 --> 13:36.767
See, it's worn out, maybe replaced it.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.621
This was done again by the bibliotech.

13:40.021 --> 13:42.124
No, this would have been done by the monks in Mainz.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.546
See, look at this, for example.

13:44.347 --> 13:47.411
Probably the 18th century.

13:48.132 --> 13:48.993
All right.

13:49.013 --> 13:50.575
The other pages are in better shape.

13:50.936 --> 13:53.339
See, that page isn't too bad now.

13:53.359 --> 13:55.302
Here, this is, come on, 41A.

13:55.802 --> 13:56.603
This is a good page.

13:56.623 --> 14:01.410
There's a lot of nice things here.

14:02.011 --> 14:03.953
Now, look at here, for example, see?

14:04.895 --> 14:06.737
These two words I'm pointing at.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.152
And see what happens after it.

14:09.212 --> 14:12.116
Now take it over here.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.142
See how it throws everything on the next line?

14:18.803 --> 14:20.185
So it all has to be reset.

14:20.925 --> 14:22.527
Definitely.

14:22.547 --> 14:24.950
Of course, they weren't too concerned about justification here, were they?

14:25.010 --> 14:25.711
No, no.

14:25.811 --> 14:29.935
Well, that isn't too bad with the hyphen there.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.978
But it's not as good as the Bible.

14:31.998 --> 14:33.079
There's no question about that.

14:33.768 --> 14:42.680
Now, but you can see that's a major affair they had to deal with.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.568
But this abbreviation there makes it able to come out okay, finally.

14:49.629 --> 14:51.151
Now then there are other things also.

14:52.413 --> 14:57.520
Look, for example, the first one is up here, yes.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.321
Look at DABO.

14:59.543 --> 15:00.965
See?

15:00.985 --> 15:03.488
Ligatures versus separate letters.

15:03.907 --> 15:06.410
There's a ligature for D-A, there's a ligature for B-O.

15:06.430 --> 15:07.431
Well, who would have picked that up?

15:07.451 --> 15:10.235
They look pretty close to me, to tell you the truth, the damos.

15:10.655 --> 15:11.656
Well, they can't, yeah.

15:11.676 --> 15:13.459
No, B-O is definitely off.

15:13.599 --> 15:14.480
But who would have found that?

15:14.520 --> 15:16.823
In other words, somebody has actually checked these word for word.

15:16.843 --> 15:18.024
Oh, sure.

15:18.044 --> 15:20.547
Well, Masson certainly did that.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.790
Then what's, now, oh, this is a joke right here.

15:23.951 --> 15:27.796
You see, the U fell upside down, fell up, put it upside down there.

15:27.996 --> 15:28.277
Yeah.

15:28.337 --> 15:29.458
Equins, the horse.

15:30.333 --> 15:34.198
to give you a totally different word.

15:34.238 --> 15:34.819
A non-word.

15:34.839 --> 15:40.227
You have to have a U after a cue to get started with anything.

15:40.287 --> 15:44.172
You can't have a consonant after a U. And then what else?

15:44.913 --> 15:47.857
There's something that's the matter in this line.

15:49.379 --> 15:56.088
F. F. Oh, yes, F. Let's see.

15:56.108 --> 15:58.872
Let's see.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.652
There's no idea.

16:03.732 --> 16:04.493
There's a difference there.

16:04.613 --> 16:08.497
And then there's also omnes, you see there.

16:11.339 --> 16:12.160
So that's the next page.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.782
There's a lot of good stuff there.

16:14.422 --> 16:18.306
Then on page 45, this is one of my favorite phenomena.

16:20.268 --> 16:23.791
Well, the thing they had, you know, I'll have to stop pretty soon.

16:23.811 --> 16:25.052
Okay, you can stop this by the way.

16:27.094 --> 16:29.997
Alas, this is too bad.

16:30.017 --> 16:31.018
Have a nice time.

16:31.522 --> 16:39.371
Well, you see, this canum, for example, see, they have to file these letters down to fit underneath the initials.

16:40.152 --> 16:44.878
See, there's an honest-to-God F, and there's a file down there.

16:44.898 --> 17:00.837
And also, there's the I after a T, where a T bangs into an I, they have a special, here, this kind of I. You see, an ordinary I, oh, that's a good one.

17:01.087 --> 17:10.617
The ordinary eye, there, has something going out the left at the top, but you can't have it when their teeth come banging into an e. That's an abutting form.

17:11.297 --> 17:16.463
Well, but you see there was all this filing going on, and some guy didn't like it very well.

17:17.023 --> 17:21.107
And there was a verse coming up where it says, he will mash his teeth at him.

17:22.289 --> 17:24.711
And Salvejra got ready for that.

17:25.732 --> 17:27.073
And it comes up over here.

17:27.954 --> 17:30.537
Svidebit super aim dendibus suis.

17:30.719 --> 17:34.063
with his teeth, his teeth, and so look at the teeth in that eye.

17:34.503 --> 17:34.923
Teeth.

17:35.945 --> 17:36.906
There you can see his file.

17:39.028 --> 17:43.072
There's teeth in it, in that eye, so you have to look at it.

17:43.092 --> 17:43.673
And, uh, showing there.

17:43.693 --> 17:45.034
Yeah, yeah.

17:45.054 --> 17:45.635
Yeah, same thing there.

17:46.476 --> 17:53.043
And, uh, uh, I'll give you some, I was putting teeth in the solder, I call it.

17:53.083 --> 17:56.006
That's your favorite item in the whole collection, I think you said.

17:56.026 --> 17:57.427
This book, yeah.

17:58.008 --> 17:58.228
Yeah.

17:58.698 --> 18:07.711
Well, then we skip a lot of stuff there, and there's a nice page, you know, the big, fine initials, printed initials.

18:10.955 --> 18:20.028
Here, for example, here's the letter that doesn't fit, you see, this F. And if that super hadn't stopped there, I don't know what they would have done.

18:20.048 --> 18:22.051
There isn't any room for it.

18:22.071 --> 18:23.533
And that's the only F they have in here.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.439
Then, you see, these are nice pages.

18:28.212 --> 18:29.433
It's very good.

18:30.514 --> 18:32.976
At the Exhibit in New York, there's neither the one.

18:32.996 --> 18:35.819
My father had a fragment of one page.

18:35.839 --> 18:39.562
It was 72, which is right over here.

18:40.683 --> 18:41.444
Yeah, here's that page.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.185
This is the one.

18:43.206 --> 18:43.746
That's right.

18:43.786 --> 18:44.106
That way.

18:44.647 --> 18:46.649
And it's conjugated towards the end of the gathering.

18:46.929 --> 18:55.016
Are there any, are there any, I know you have to go, but are there any items that you really, that have alluded to, that you'd really love to have?

18:55.076 --> 18:56.558
Well, I'd be glad to have a bass-on book.

18:56.578 --> 18:58.219
I wouldn't have fixed that.

18:58.790 --> 19:03.075
Now, here's this page.

19:03.095 --> 19:04.437
This is a very curious page.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.382
There's four on this side and four on that side, see?

19:08.402 --> 19:18.375
And in particular, when you have, for example, two of the same letters, you certainly do there, you take them out and you have to re-ink them, you see, and make it different colors.

19:19.376 --> 19:24.342
And this, the A ordinarily has a lot of ornament around it, but they

19:24.440 --> 19:33.453
And it would get tangled up with the ornament at the end of the tail of the pea, so they took the ornament off the A. But even that wasn't good enough, and I want to show you what happens over here.

19:33.473 --> 19:39.662
Of course, here come the saints marching in, and that's a nice place.

19:43.027 --> 19:43.127
Yeah.

19:44.108 --> 19:46.572
What is this book doing, by the way, on the web page?

19:46.592 --> 19:47.433
It's a psalter.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.397
It's a psalter.

19:51.068 --> 19:52.189
Here's the first page.

19:52.229 --> 19:53.651
Now, come over to the second page.

19:53.691 --> 19:56.234
Remember, there's too much collision still there.

19:56.675 --> 19:57.476
So look what they did.

19:58.217 --> 19:59.759
This is the way we often exhibit the thing.

20:01.220 --> 20:06.527
They took it out of the ornament.

20:06.567 --> 20:07.368
No ornament at all.

20:09.490 --> 20:12.554
You see, it's a nice way to exhibit it like that, you see.

20:13.055 --> 20:15.878
So you can see the two together.

20:15.898 --> 20:19.022
Well, there's no question about it.

20:19.042 --> 20:19.843
It's dramatically different.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.365
That's an interesting piece of technology.

20:24.385 --> 20:27.570
I wonder who did this facsimile must have been quite a job, too.

20:27.590 --> 20:28.171
Yeah, that's great.

20:28.191 --> 20:29.092
That's a good job, yeah.

20:29.493 --> 20:30.635
Well, yeah.

20:30.655 --> 20:30.955
Okay.

20:30.975 --> 20:34.921
I'll show you one more book, and then I want to check and know.

20:34.941 --> 20:36.423
Why do you go out of 530?

20:36.443 --> 20:37.325
Pilots.

20:38.466 --> 20:39.248
I'm just going to go.

20:39.268 --> 20:41.190
You said that's a problem.

20:41.511 --> 20:46.378
Bill's getting into trouble with Dr. Wood.

20:46.398 --> 20:47.360
Why didn't you go back to that one?

20:47.380 --> 20:47.540
Sir?

20:47.740 --> 20:48.401
Oh, yes, sir.

20:48.421 --> 20:48.902
Yes, sir.

20:49.439 --> 21:01.411
Bill, I got a sense that you know this collection.

21:01.711 --> 21:03.333
Almost as good as Mr. Shady's.

21:03.673 --> 21:05.215
No way.

21:05.235 --> 21:06.656
No way.

21:07.997 --> 21:13.062
Here's Dr. Rosenbach now bowing down in homage.

21:14.144 --> 21:15.445
He's here.

21:16.346 --> 21:17.607
Pastor Lee Rosenbach.

21:18.818 --> 21:23.783
He signed it, November 28th, 1925.

21:23.843 --> 21:28.308
All right, what is he boasting about?

21:28.528 --> 21:31.491
Or what is he rejoicing about, or whatever it is, whatever one does.

21:32.772 --> 21:35.635
This is supposedly the best copy there is of this.

21:37.477 --> 21:40.700
The Pilgrim's Progress from this world to that which is to come.

21:41.001 --> 21:42.122
Yeah, all right, this is 1678.

21:43.183 --> 21:44.765
And you see, it's a very nice, nice copy.

21:44.785 --> 21:45.766
It is a perfect copy.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.087
It's a very nice copy.

21:47.405 --> 21:48.726
It's very clean and nice.

21:49.127 --> 21:55.053
And we took this over for exhibit at the Preen, the Mind of Man, the thing that Nicholas Parker was writing about.

21:55.073 --> 22:01.039
I showed this to Howard Nixon at that time, the binding man who knows more about bindings than anybody I ever met.

22:01.820 --> 22:06.024
And he said, I've never seen a book of this type in such condition.

22:06.785 --> 22:07.886
And they never opened it.

22:07.906 --> 22:12.690
And I had to tell the director of the British Museum, I said, we didn't make it into cigar box.

22:14.252 --> 22:17.175
We used x-rays to determine it, he said.

22:17.493 --> 22:20.417
That was acquired from the doctor.

22:21.058 --> 22:27.447
My father got this, you know, when the doctor wasn't around, he had the right to go into, he had the privilege going into his vault.

22:27.467 --> 22:34.036
And when the doctor really went in there and bought it from his assistant, Rosenbach's postion was very mad to come back and found it.

22:34.176 --> 22:39.764
And so... We've been working, there's a copy coming up at Bradley Martin's.

22:39.784 --> 22:40.345
That's exquisite.

22:41.066 --> 22:42.408
But that's a treasure.

22:42.588 --> 22:43.990
And Dr. Rosenbach was

22:44.442 --> 22:47.525
adding leaves and we're supposed to expose them in an article.

22:47.545 --> 22:48.386
Really?

22:48.406 --> 22:48.886
Is that right?

22:48.966 --> 22:50.127
Yeah.

22:50.147 --> 22:51.308
Are you going to publish this?

22:51.328 --> 22:51.509
Yeah.

22:51.709 --> 22:58.475
Paul, Liam and I and Leslie Warren.

22:59.676 --> 23:05.041
Leslie is very nice.

23:05.061 --> 23:05.522
Yeah.

23:05.542 --> 23:06.843
I hope I can talk to you again, sir.

23:07.263 --> 23:07.824
Oh, I hope.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.485
We're very excited about you.

23:09.525 --> 23:09.926
Thank you.

23:10.086 --> 23:12.508
In fact, the next time I come down, if I make

23:13.045 --> 23:14.406
Come again, I'd like to.

23:14.426 --> 23:18.370
The only favor I would ask of you before you leave, would you please sign him up?

23:18.550 --> 23:18.750
I did.

23:18.850 --> 23:35.706
I signed on the way in.

23:35.726 --> 23:36.167
One, two, three, four.

23:36.187 --> 23:36.627
One, two, three, four.

23:36.647 --> 23:41.652
One, two, three, four.

23:52.600 --> 23:52.977
Bye.
