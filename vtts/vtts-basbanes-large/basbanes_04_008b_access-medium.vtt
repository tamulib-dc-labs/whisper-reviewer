00:02.275 --> 00:22.208
Uh at one time before they became famous and dead for a hundred years, they were very much a human being. Lamb two quicks if I could. Did you need to get the uh author's permission to turn around and put the second book out? No. So that that was all copper robin. You had no problem with that and the other question

00:22.441 --> 00:26.807
everything, as I understand it in the book from my checking, is also available on the Internet site?

00:27.168 --> 00:32.214
Every single word of it is it's all on the Internet site, and the full transcript's on the Internet site.

00:32.615 --> 00:37.702
That's remarkable access, and you folks keep doing that with your product.

00:37.722 --> 00:41.487
You keep putting it out there as freely and as unencumbered as you can.

00:43.350 --> 00:52.262
But we publish for a living, and, of course, everybody in this business is trying to find some way to make money off of their Internet sites, and we haven't been able to do that quite yet.

00:52.597 --> 00:57.064
But do you plan to keep C-SPAN as available as it is now?

00:58.046 --> 01:00.650
Well, remember what's at the base of why we exist.

01:00.690 --> 01:13.491
This is a public service created by a private industry, and they give us enough money to do our job and let us do what we do and basically give everything we do away.

01:13.471 --> 01:25.108
It's never been quite understood because even in these high schools, they're used to the public television people coming in saying, you have to pay a lot of money for these programs and you can only use them for a year.

01:25.749 --> 01:26.651
It's been the hardest thing.

01:26.671 --> 01:29.715
I mean, teachers' mouths drop open when we tell them this is all free.

01:30.316 --> 01:36.786
And I think in some ways we should charge because if you do charge in this country, it has bigger value than if you give it away.

01:37.587 --> 01:41.132
I'm astounded how often when I go out and speak, I don't charge money.

01:41.905 --> 01:44.349
And, you know, people treat you that way.

01:45.871 --> 01:58.950
I once attended an Abraham Lincoln impersonator's meeting, and I was speaking to them one night, and there were 57 Abraham Lincoln look-alikes in the room.

01:58.970 --> 02:04.538
And I walked in the back of the room, and they didn't even know I was in the room, and this guy's up at the podium looking like Abraham Lincoln and saying,

02:04.518 --> 02:06.803
Gentlemen, I want to tell you one thing.

02:06.863 --> 02:17.246
When you're out there and you're President of the United States, if you don't charge for being out there, they'll treat you like you're not President of the United States.

02:17.266 --> 02:20.333
And I never go anywhere where I don't charge at least $300 a day.

02:20.667 --> 02:24.834
And I got such a kick out of that because in this society, that's true.

02:25.536 --> 02:33.409
You know, if we said everything on our website has to cost you $1,000, a lot of these high schools around here probably say, man, that's fabulous.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.092
Let's pay that grand.

02:35.132 --> 02:39.520
And now when you give it away, they kind of just take it for granted and don't pay much attention to it.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.845
Do you keep a score of hits?

02:41.865 --> 02:44.771
What I want to see is the picture of you with 57 Abraham Lincolns.

02:45.212 --> 02:47.176
God, that was fun.

02:47.196 --> 02:53.530
I'm telling you, when they asked me to do that, I said immediately, I said, put me down just for the sheer pleasure.

02:53.610 --> 02:56.496
I want to be there and see that.

02:58.163 --> 02:59.345
Brian, one quick question.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.912
You mentioned in your introduction again about C-SPAN's public affairs mission.

03:04.653 --> 03:10.964
Is that the reason why you decided to do all non-fiction and not include some fiction?

03:11.444 --> 03:13.047
Yes.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.531
It's not any more complicated than that.

03:15.646 --> 03:20.354
You know, a lot of people give us gas for not doing fiction.

03:20.374 --> 03:24.280
And my response to that, look, there's a lot of places in this world you can go get your fiction.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.844
We are just a nonfiction network.

03:27.004 --> 03:29.489
And we had to have some way to narrow this down.

03:29.549 --> 03:29.789
Right.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.572
And that's the only reason.

03:32.393 --> 03:39.645
There's no great, you know, most of what we do here is, one thing I can guarantee you, there's never, ever been a marketing study done.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.051
because this makes sense, will this work?

03:42.432 --> 03:47.037
We do it because our gut says that's the thing to try and we can afford to try it.

03:47.437 --> 03:49.239
If it doesn't work, we stop doing it.

03:49.539 --> 04:00.670
And even if it doesn't work as well as somebody in commercial television would have to have it work, we continue to do it because it fills in this public affairs thing that we're into.

04:00.690 --> 04:00.810
Right.

04:02.012 --> 04:03.073
Well, it makes perfect sense.

04:03.894 --> 04:07.337
Well, we're very, very, very, very lucky

04:07.621 --> 04:31.958
not to have to worry about making money, and I'm a you know I'm a capitalist. You know if it wasn't for the cable business, we wouldn't be in business, but just within our little world here it's amazing how different it is when you don't have to deliver eyeballs to advertisers. I'm just glad I've been able to do it this way instead of the other way because you never have to come in every day and take a look at those numbers and then

04:32.832 --> 04:39.439
the next time around do something ridiculous in order to keep the, what I think is ridiculous, to keep the numbers up there.

04:39.459 --> 04:42.362
What about satisfying the cable industry that does fund you?

04:42.783 --> 04:46.727
I mean, you have to do a little bit of pleasing on that side, don't you?

04:46.988 --> 04:48.910
Isn't it almost akin to fundraising?

04:51.232 --> 04:57.619
No, I tell you, you'd be surprised at how detached the industry leaders are from everything we do here.

04:57.659 --> 05:00.122
I mean, they don't really demand much.

05:00.372 --> 05:02.335
So they've made the commitment and it stands.

05:02.495 --> 05:13.749
Yeah, and, you know, I think part of that is we've had some outstanding people that have been on the board, been the chairman, been my boss, in effect, and they really have never asked for anything in return.

05:14.270 --> 05:17.274
Also, I think the industry has done very well.

05:17.674 --> 05:21.779
I mean, these people have been involved in this business and made a ton of money.

05:21.799 --> 05:25.224
I think if it were a tighter time, they might look at us and say, why are we doing that?

05:25.244 --> 05:26.245
But it has never been there.

05:27.035 --> 05:34.868
It just occurred to me that you're really in a similar situation to those who worked in newsrooms in the era

05:35.455 --> 05:39.380
when newspapers made so much money they didn't know how to spend all of it.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.601
I think you're probably right.

05:41.282 --> 05:42.623
We weren't that way in the beginning.

05:42.764 --> 05:46.648
In the beginning, it was like squeezing blood out of a turnip.

05:47.509 --> 05:50.813
We had a hard time getting funding and a hard time getting it increased.

05:52.155 --> 05:57.981
Some of the people who have made billions, the only one that I remember, we only had one negative vote in the last 20 years.

05:58.001 --> 06:02.106
This was a guy who's no longer alive who made several, a couple billion dollars in the business.

06:02.126 --> 06:02.847
He was really

06:03.400 --> 06:08.266
cheap and was the only guy that ever voted against a rate increase.

06:08.286 --> 06:12.552
But I don't have any complaints about the money part of it.

06:13.733 --> 06:23.626
The only complaint I have is that sometimes a few of the leaders haven't been as aggressive as I thought they should have been in getting this thing covered and put on these cable systems.

06:23.866 --> 06:27.731
But I don't have a very big beef with people in the business.

06:27.751 --> 06:29.053
If I have a beef, it's with this

06:29.557 --> 06:34.627
legislation they passed here that the Congress had no idea what it would do, and it did us more harm than anybody else's.

06:34.647 --> 06:35.749
But I don't want to get into that.

06:35.769 --> 06:39.497
You guys have better things to do than that.

06:39.517 --> 06:40.338
Brian, are you having fun?

06:42.222 --> 06:42.643
What was that?

06:43.465 --> 06:44.928
Are you having a lot of fun?

06:45.228 --> 06:46.731
Yeah, I think so.

06:46.892 --> 06:51.160
I've always been a guy that...

06:51.713 --> 06:55.701
Depending on the day, looks at the glass being half full, half empty, it changes from day to day.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.428
But right now has been a pretty good period.

06:59.448 --> 07:00.510
We've kind of settled down.

07:00.570 --> 07:01.392
We haven't had to fight.

07:02.133 --> 07:10.689
The worst thing in the world here is when you're fighting with your own customers and they're dropping us because of something that's going wrong because of the legislation.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.332
But right now things are in pretty good shape.

07:13.354 --> 07:14.717
I don't have anything to complain about.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.812
We wish you well with the book.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.337
Hey, thank you all for being interested.

07:20.357 --> 07:29.855
I want to put a motion on the floor here before we hang up, and that is that next time they're going to add faces to Mount Rushmore, I want to nominate Steven Spielberg and Brian Lamb.

07:29.875 --> 07:30.837
Can I bring that to a vote?

07:30.957 --> 07:32.320
I'll vote for Lamb.

07:32.340 --> 07:35.386
Thanks, everybody.

07:35.807 --> 07:36.708
Thanks, Brian.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.269
Take care.

07:37.530 --> 07:38.612
Bye-bye.
