WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:02.959
Okay.

00:02.979 --> 00:03.900
Well, congratulations.

00:03.960 --> 00:07.904
We're talking to Valerie Martin about her new book.

00:08.044 --> 00:10.927
I don't think I interviewed you in the previous book.

00:11.227 --> 00:13.109
I'm sure I didn't.

00:13.970 --> 00:21.918
But you certainly have built up legions of followers with the work you've been doing.

00:22.698 --> 00:27.744
Tell me how you go from Mary Riley to the Great Divorce.

00:27.764 --> 00:32.248
Is there a thematic kind of connection here?

00:32.465 --> 00:36.009
Well, I think they probably are, but they weren't known to me when I started.

00:36.069 --> 00:44.577
Mary Riley is about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, so it's about somebody with two personalities and about a dark side.

00:45.879 --> 00:56.790
I think when I started this book, The Great Divorce, I wanted to do something completely different, but it turned out that it, too, is about people who have two sides and a dark side.

00:56.810 --> 01:01.695
And in this book, there's a character who actually turns into a weapon.

01:02.806 --> 01:06.830
The metamorphosis does seem to be a preoccupation of yours.

01:07.231 --> 01:08.292
Yeah, it is.

01:08.572 --> 01:09.433
Why is that?

01:09.834 --> 01:10.735
I don't know.

01:10.775 --> 01:15.580
I've always liked stories about transformation of metamorphosis.

01:15.600 --> 01:22.007
I like to see statues of creatures that are half human, half bad.

01:22.027 --> 01:32.458
But I think it's also because I grew up in New Orleans where there are a lot of strange stories about dogs and werewolves.

01:33.333 --> 01:46.110
So it's partly that, but it's partly that they serve as metaphors to talk about the unconscious and also imagination.

01:53.887 --> 01:59.294
The title of this book, of course, gives no indication of what it's about.

01:59.855 --> 02:06.002
Again, how about picking up on this concept of a great divorce?

02:06.683 --> 02:08.566
I mean, that could be anything, couldn't it?

02:09.427 --> 02:10.788
That could be Charles and Diana.

02:10.869 --> 02:15.655
Yeah, I think that was a really great book.

02:15.675 --> 02:18.098
They haven't divorced yet, but you see what I'm saying?

02:18.238 --> 02:19.860
Yeah.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.660
Well, I think that there is a... Let me just interject.

02:23.780 --> 02:37.922
How about if you just talk at some length about, first of all, you have this idea which you just discussed, and then taking this as a premise and working it into this concept that you have of a great divorce.

02:38.203 --> 02:39.705
Maybe just talk a little bit about that.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.528
Well, I think that...

02:42.335 --> 02:51.224
It comes out of an argument I have with myself about feelings about the wild and about nature and about how we talk about human nature.

02:51.244 --> 02:53.906
When we talk about human nature, we talk about good.

02:54.647 --> 02:56.609
Someone behaves badly.

02:59.271 --> 03:01.493
You say we don't talk about anything good.

03:02.414 --> 03:05.177
Well, not quite easily.

03:05.197 --> 03:10.502
You say, gee, human nature is sort of a what can you expect?

03:11.073 --> 03:17.021
Well, if you say somebody behaves like an animal, well, that means they behave very badly.

03:17.041 --> 03:27.977
At the same time, there's a sort of noble beast involving a notion that animals are in some ways more moral than we are.

03:28.377 --> 03:29.739
Or amoral, at least.

03:29.759 --> 03:33.164
Yeah, that they are more natural than we are.

03:33.184 --> 03:35.828
I mean, a shark doesn't eat you because he hates you.

03:35.868 --> 03:37.350
That's right, yeah.

03:38.427 --> 03:50.564
The notion of somebody murdering somebody just because they're trying to tell them to stay home, that seems unnapped because it's an animal who is a steward.

03:50.584 --> 03:56.252
So that suggests that we wouldn't be unnapped.

03:56.472 --> 04:00.698
Well, let's go on now to the divorce, the great divorce itself.

04:01.259 --> 04:07.928
This book, the narrator thinks of it as the separation between all humans and all of nature.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.324
which took place a long time ago.

04:10.726 --> 04:26.301
And then, of course, the novelist's job is to take this and to make a wonderfully engaging story out of it.

04:27.082 --> 04:34.929
Tell me about the creative process that ensues from that starting point.

04:35.130 --> 04:39.754
Well, the story really stands in my mind, and it's kind of interesting.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.650
I'm sorry, the woman, what?

04:43.670 --> 04:46.973
Sowing.

04:46.993 --> 04:49.356
Sowing, okay.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.278
Where stuff like that comes from, I don't know.

04:52.439 --> 04:59.526
And I began to think about wanting to write about the vanity of the wild and the place of it would be a zoo.

04:59.546 --> 05:09.416
That's where the central story comes from, the story of a veterinarian who literally does in order to sew it together.

05:09.436 --> 05:10.737
And then the other story,

05:13.771 --> 05:16.614
my feelings about the way we romanticize the one.

05:17.835 --> 05:39.995
Elizabeth, who lives here in the 19th century, imagined that he could go to the Cleveland doctor and be liberated from her body to her husband by turning into a wedding and told that this could happen.

05:40.015 --> 05:42.377
I believe it could happen, because it was at a time when people did believe it.

05:42.397 --> 05:43.558
Whereas Camille, who also would like to be

05:43.808 --> 06:12.415
I guess I read someplace that this started when you had heard about a woman vet veterinarian at the New Orleans Zoo.

06:12.547 --> 06:14.029
Yeah, it was a bit of luck.

06:14.109 --> 06:21.920
I was sort of looking around and thinking that I wanted to find out what goes on behind the scenes to do.

06:21.940 --> 06:28.589
And a good friend called me and said, well, I have a new name for it.

06:29.030 --> 06:31.013
It's almost like karma, isn't it?

06:31.033 --> 06:31.293
It's strange.

06:31.313 --> 06:33.396
You know how books sometimes come from you?

06:33.416 --> 06:34.858
Somebody will keep mentioning a book.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.743
It sounds out to be exactly the book we use.

06:37.763 --> 06:38.364
It's amazing.

06:40.728 --> 06:43.773
The zoo, of course, is a metaphor in its own right, isn't it?

06:45.155 --> 06:48.800
Yeah, it's the place where we keep the wild behind bars.

06:48.980 --> 06:54.689
But on the other end, it can almost be seen as the last refuge, too, couldn't it?

06:54.729 --> 06:57.253
Well, that's what's so ironic about it.

06:57.273 --> 06:58.495
The zoo is so sad.

06:58.515 --> 07:03.242
The people who work in the zoo really do see it as an ark, and they're trying to save the zoo.

07:03.880 --> 07:13.915
And coincidental for this, you see the reports of the tigers in Asia.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.658
I mean, it's just heartbreaking.

07:15.858 --> 07:21.887
It's amazing.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.723
Do you share the same pessimism?

07:33.091 --> 07:34.652
I really do, especially about tigers.

07:35.693 --> 07:47.864
You know, animals that are so important in our imagination and cultural memories, and they represent all sorts of magic and history.

07:47.964 --> 07:53.189
They're also very dangerous, and they require a really large habitat, and those habitat are just scary.

07:53.969 --> 07:57.312
I can't imagine where they can come back.

07:57.332 --> 07:59.114
This is everywhere, or just Asia?

07:59.554 --> 08:00.635
It's everywhere tigers were.

08:00.675 --> 08:01.596
Tigers are really...

08:03.078 --> 08:06.161
There are not many other grasses.

08:06.181 --> 08:09.524
But some bigger cats may have a slightly better day.

08:09.544 --> 08:18.013
I think that tigers really require a fairly large habitat.

08:19.114 --> 08:22.697
Do you also think that they will die out of zoos as well?

08:23.098 --> 08:28.343
Well, once the gene pools get down small enough, there's not enough diversity in the gene pools.

08:31.799 --> 08:42.311
I mean, you know, it's just like what happens to the humans.

08:42.331 --> 08:43.212
We have hemophilia, you know, in the ground.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.874
Some weak strain presents in all captive tigers.

08:44.894 --> 08:51.522
There's already problems with something.

08:51.542 --> 08:58.610
One of them, one of them, they've already got genetic problems in the captive pool.

08:58.630 --> 09:01.013
So that if some little thing comes along, they'll all get wiped out.

09:02.225 --> 09:03.547
It's so sad.

09:03.567 --> 09:08.112
I mean, I don't know if you've had a chance to see the Audubon watercolor exhibition.

09:08.693 --> 09:09.494
No, I just heard about it.

09:09.514 --> 09:11.116
I was thinking I'd like to go.

09:11.276 --> 09:12.117
Well, you should go see it.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.759
You know, these are the original watercolors.

09:14.801 --> 09:17.584
And, yeah, it's really quite wonderful.

09:17.884 --> 09:19.426
I mean, in fact, we saw it twice.

09:19.446 --> 09:21.409
We saw it down in Washington, and we saw it up here.

09:21.449 --> 09:24.252
And I think the one up here is better, by the way.

09:24.292 --> 09:25.614
They have a few more things.

09:25.754 --> 09:28.718
It's not just watercolors, and they have a couple of artifacts.

09:29.339 --> 09:29.599
I've got one.

09:30.288 --> 09:32.750
Yeah, I really strongly recommend it.

09:33.231 --> 09:36.694
But, you know, you walk by and then you see the Carolina parrot.

09:37.195 --> 09:39.177
And right next to that is the passenger pigeon.

09:39.898 --> 09:40.398
Beautiful.

09:40.478 --> 09:44.702
And they actually have some stuffed examples of these, I think.

09:44.722 --> 09:45.863
I know those were down in Washington.

09:45.923 --> 09:46.724
Okay.

09:46.744 --> 09:52.650
But there they are, you know, the only parakeet native to North America.

09:52.810 --> 09:53.331
Extinct.

09:53.391 --> 09:53.591
Why?

09:53.671 --> 09:55.553
Because they had lovely feathers for hats.

09:55.972 --> 09:57.994
the passenger pigeon for any number of them.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.077
Beautiful birds, you know, extinct.

10:00.998 --> 10:19.600
You know, I read a lot of Audubon's letters, and what's really strange is that although he walked through a world that's so rich and filled with life at that time, he could have any kind of be right beside his fear for the animals.

10:19.917 --> 10:26.505
Now, would you describe yourself as an animal activist, or are you a novelist who's concerned?

10:26.525 --> 10:29.449
I mean, tell me a little bit about where you're coming from in this.

10:29.930 --> 10:35.878
Well, I'm not in despair, and I would certainly do what I can and try to encourage everybody else to.

10:35.898 --> 10:44.408
But I also think it's important to be realistic about what we're up against.

10:44.429 --> 10:47.933
And sometimes I think people feel like, well, I'm just recycling.

10:48.993 --> 10:59.829
That'll help, and of extension will, but the speed with which this is happening is truly frightening.

11:02.072 --> 11:05.818
It's more than a species a day going out of existence now.

11:05.838 --> 11:06.619
Say that again?

11:06.639 --> 11:10.965
It's more than a species every day that goes out of existence.

11:10.985 --> 11:12.528
I mean, is this documented?

11:12.548 --> 11:12.788
Yeah, yeah.

11:12.808 --> 11:18.797
You know, a plant that has, and a lot of it's in the rainforest where

11:19.081 --> 11:31.294
Yeah, and things are going out of existence that we never even knew existed before we even had a chance to classify them.

11:31.314 --> 11:37.461
Yeah, something you would never notice.

11:37.481 --> 11:40.905
I've always personally felt mosquitoes can go out of existence.

11:41.045 --> 11:41.665
Yeah, that's right.

11:41.685 --> 11:42.987
But they have a place on the chain.

11:43.527 --> 11:45.369
And that's the other thing, of course, that it is a chain.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.772
It starts to break down.

11:49.912 --> 11:54.178
I mean, you go through the Everglades sometime, and you just see how everything works.

11:55.219 --> 11:58.984
I mean, the alligators dig little holes that the fish can come in.

12:00.125 --> 12:00.886
It's amazing.

12:01.127 --> 12:06.233
And you mess up one of those links, and the whole thing is threatened.

12:06.994 --> 12:11.380
And strangely enough, though, I don't want to live next door to a tiger as a part of the link.

12:12.862 --> 12:19.069
You know, this guy, Jim Farmer, who you see every once in a while, I mean, I'm terrified of snakes, you know?

12:19.970 --> 12:22.513
I mean, it's primal.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.173
Yeah, rats.

12:23.314 --> 12:27.638
But I can't see any use for rats, I have to say, as an old Navy guy.

12:29.901 --> 12:33.285
But, you know, you certainly don't want to make friends with them.

12:33.325 --> 12:35.427
I don't imagine you ever could, but...

12:36.031 --> 12:37.898
They got a purpose, don't they?

12:37.918 --> 12:38.641
They have a purpose.

12:39.163 --> 12:40.990
Yeah.

12:41.351 --> 12:43.459
Once snakes are gone, well, that could cause a lot of stuff.

12:43.591 --> 12:53.284
So now let's talk about, I mean, all right, so you have this sense, and you want to talk about it in a book.

12:53.985 --> 12:58.050
But, of course, you choose to do this through the fiction form.

12:59.633 --> 13:00.574
What do you start with?

13:00.594 --> 13:07.984
Do you start with a story and your characters, or do you start with this premise and then tell me how this developed?

13:08.064 --> 13:08.164
Okay.

13:09.359 --> 13:10.160
work differently.

13:10.420 --> 13:17.450
This one really did start with the three stories pretty clear in my mind, especially in the way that they would connect.

13:17.470 --> 13:22.276
That is, I knew that Paul was going to be researching the old story of the Catwoman of St.

13:22.296 --> 13:22.497
Francis.

13:24.139 --> 13:29.286
And I knew that Ellen and Camille would be connected because they both work as a suit.

13:29.306 --> 13:37.577
So that's sort of a proposition, and I set the characters rolling and watching them rub up against each other and see what happens.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.425
Some things I know.

13:39.806 --> 13:44.251
I knew the last sentence, but I didn't know other things.

13:44.271 --> 13:48.356
For instance, I didn't know what was going to happen to Camille.

13:48.376 --> 13:50.979
And that became clear as the story moved on.

13:50.999 --> 13:55.205
I also didn't know in what ways the stories would intertwine.

13:55.225 --> 14:02.113
And that was very pleasurable because they did start to sort of reflect off of each other or comment on each other.

14:02.819 --> 14:07.907
I had written maybe 60 pages and realized I'd written three dinner parties.

14:07.928 --> 14:09.891
One of them wasn't actually a dinner party.

14:09.971 --> 14:13.136
It was Camille having a miserable grilled cheese sandwich.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.360
That's her idea of a dinner party.

14:16.261 --> 14:18.084
So I wrote from the beginning to the end.

14:18.145 --> 14:22.051
I write by hand on blue-foot paper.

14:22.071 --> 14:24.295
So I didn't write one story and plug it into the other.

14:24.315 --> 14:25.637
They really came out of each other.

14:27.102 --> 14:29.746
Is it pretty much clean, straight through?

14:29.846 --> 14:33.411
Yeah, I pretty much write it straight through and then type it.

14:33.431 --> 14:36.214
Type it on manuscript paper or on a word processor?

14:36.234 --> 14:38.077
No, no, I don't use a word processor.

14:38.097 --> 14:39.759
I just use loosely paper.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.640
Even when you're typing?

14:42.122 --> 14:43.724
I use the most primitive typewriter.

14:43.845 --> 14:47.289
It does have an erase feature.

14:48.190 --> 14:50.053
Is this just out of habit, or do you have something?

14:50.153 --> 14:53.818
I've tried other ways, and this is the fastest way for me.

14:54.423 --> 14:59.511
and I go off on fewer tangents and make fewer wrong turns.

15:00.052 --> 15:09.828
I usually have a little work at the end in the last chapters, and I did have to make a few changes towards the end because I get tired and try to rush.

15:09.888 --> 15:12.112
How long did you work on this book?

15:12.132 --> 15:12.773
Three years.

15:12.793 --> 15:13.354
Really?

15:13.374 --> 15:14.876
Yeah, it was a long one.

15:14.896 --> 15:18.402
With Mary Riley, it was about a year ago.

15:18.422 --> 15:20.024
This was harder than Riley?

15:20.485 --> 15:21.747
Oh, it's twice as big.

15:22.351 --> 15:28.198
I'm sorry, but I'm in terms of the, was it more daunting a task for you?

15:28.599 --> 15:29.881
Yeah, it was a much harder task.

15:30.942 --> 15:37.831
For one thing, it's not in the first person, so you don't have a character's voice to pull the reason going through.

15:38.331 --> 15:42.477
You have to interest them in the characters by approaching them from outside.

15:42.497 --> 15:44.399
I find that more difficult.

15:44.419 --> 15:48.564
Had you thought at all about narrating this, having one of the characters?

15:48.885 --> 15:50.687
Yeah, I knew it would be impossible.

15:51.410 --> 15:53.273
Especially if you have those three different stories.

15:53.573 --> 16:01.304
Right, and I wanted to have a consciousness outside of it that looks at the whole picture because to me that's what the great divorce is.

16:01.364 --> 16:07.853
There's these two pictures running along beside each other.

16:08.614 --> 16:10.757
So I wanted to have an eyeball that could see all that.

16:11.819 --> 16:16.185
We see wild animals and wild animals see us.

16:17.279 --> 16:21.543
couldn't actually describe what each sees as in any way.

16:21.743 --> 16:24.946
In your view, is it a hopeful book?

16:26.747 --> 16:33.673
I think that some reviewer described it as a thin glimmer of hope.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.115
Do you agree with that reviewer?

16:35.575 --> 16:37.136
Yeah.

16:37.176 --> 16:40.459
Why not?

16:40.539 --> 16:47.185
I thought that the end, and it came partly from my experience at the zoo watching the people who work there,

16:47.283 --> 17:17.104
dedicated they are to the hopeless work that it has a great deal of meaning in what they do they love their work and it's worthwhile and so that's hopeful uh now i understand that our film is in the works on this no not for this for mary reilly oh i see have you optioned this not yet this would be this would really pose some some uh it would be kind of formidable don't you think for a screenwriter i think it's scary for hollywood right now because there's too many characters

17:17.455 --> 17:20.118
And you can't summarize the story in a line.

17:20.459 --> 17:23.663
But there seems to be a little interest in the fact that I was just in L.A.

17:24.904 --> 17:29.090
Hopefully somebody will be brave enough to take it on.

17:29.110 --> 17:31.553
Because I think it would make a nice film, but it would be difficult.

17:32.614 --> 17:35.958
But you've got to have, you know, they're so single-minded out there.

17:35.978 --> 17:39.202
They really don't like depressing stories.

17:39.343 --> 17:40.824
You know, it's just a problem.

17:41.025 --> 17:41.245
It's true.

17:41.265 --> 17:42.527
They don't like depressing stories.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.709
They're both a practical problem.

17:44.729 --> 17:46.712
Too many actors.

17:46.772 --> 17:46.872
Yeah.

17:48.978 --> 17:50.421
How do you keep things in focus?

17:50.481 --> 17:55.553
I mean, clearly you are a writer and your job is to engage.

17:56.194 --> 18:00.203
And you might even hope to entertain as well.

18:00.571 --> 18:03.834
Uh, you know, how do you keep that in check?

18:04.935 --> 18:08.839
Why do you have this other agenda, uh, cooking, you know?

18:08.859 --> 18:10.181
I keep them grinding my axe.

18:10.241 --> 18:10.821
Exactly.

18:11.922 --> 18:16.086
This is a festival of images this morning.

18:16.106 --> 18:21.172
Yeah, it's really hard because I have a lot of opinions and in some ways I just would like to go on tirade.

18:22.393 --> 18:26.697
But, um, I think that the virtue of the novel is that, uh,

18:27.723 --> 18:29.245
It can do more than one thing.

18:29.706 --> 18:33.753
It can do a lot more than give somebody a simple message.

18:33.773 --> 18:40.404
It can give the most complicated message through the story and the interactions of the characters.

18:41.906 --> 18:45.332
I think I love the form of the novel so much.

18:45.652 --> 18:53.545
It has so much room in it and potential that I have to remind myself to shut up and let the characters talk.

18:58.368 --> 19:10.220
You mentioned that going from Mary Riley to this book, you really wanted to do something that was different.

19:10.260 --> 19:12.783
Yeah, I always do.

19:14.164 --> 19:14.905
Okay.

19:14.925 --> 19:15.526
How do you do that?

19:15.606 --> 19:21.552
I mean, how do you decide, well, all right, this book was a first-person book.

19:21.572 --> 19:23.734
It focused on one woman.

19:24.929 --> 19:44.253
I don't think it's so much that I try to change my style because I would also like people to, the way I feel about the writers I love, say, Henry James or Jane Austen or the Brontes or somebody with a simple style I can move, that you can pick up any of the books and say, I know who wrote this.

19:44.694 --> 19:52.624
I would like to have that continuity of, for want of a better word, I'll call it style, in all my books.

19:52.672 --> 19:54.535
Well, you see it as a body of work.

19:54.935 --> 19:55.636
Yeah.

19:56.277 --> 19:56.558
Yeah.

19:56.578 --> 20:01.325
But I want to change the subject matter.

20:01.365 --> 20:04.690
I really do see them as one leading into the other.

20:04.710 --> 20:10.739
And then being more and more about the whole process of writing the novel.

20:11.240 --> 20:16.327
The book to me is more about, in some ways, the imagination than others.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.233
And how it works.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.615
Especially how it works as a novel.

20:22.034 --> 20:24.497
and how it worked historically.

20:25.619 --> 20:26.039
Yeah.

20:26.059 --> 20:36.813
Looking at the cover art, not that we ever discuss cover art in my stories, but did you think it reflects the spirit of the book?

20:36.833 --> 20:40.497
Well... I guess I'm putting it gently.

20:40.557 --> 20:47.706
Again, the title is, it could really, you have to learn more about the book to know what the book is.

20:47.726 --> 20:49.088
Let me think about the title of it.

20:49.878 --> 20:52.281
Well, I think it's fine.

20:52.301 --> 20:54.784
Oh, absolutely.

20:56.446 --> 20:57.647
I'm not objecting in any way.

20:57.707 --> 21:01.011
Did you have this title all along, by the way?

21:01.191 --> 21:06.938
I did, and I had to sort of push it because it was not popular.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.379
My editor didn't like it for a while.

21:08.439 --> 21:09.941
We tried other titles.

21:09.961 --> 21:13.205
It was called Unnatural, so I came for a while.

21:13.645 --> 21:15.868
Which, I guess...

21:16.760 --> 21:19.083
Probably is more pertinent to what the book is about.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.484
I guess.

21:20.504 --> 21:25.389
But I, for some reason, wanted that title, The Great Divorce.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.370
Yeah, well, no, it's fine.

21:27.251 --> 21:30.655
And Nan edited the book?

21:30.975 --> 21:32.197
Yeah.

21:32.217 --> 21:33.078
She's crying.

21:33.138 --> 21:34.299
I know Nan, too.

21:34.439 --> 21:35.520
Very nice woman.

21:37.082 --> 21:37.843
Wonderful.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.525
And what do you go to next now?

21:40.105 --> 21:42.548
I want to write a book about a really good meaning.

21:44.975 --> 21:46.817
I'm not sure what it'll be yet.

21:48.039 --> 21:50.001
Now, I've not read all of your books.

21:54.667 --> 21:55.628
Have you written about men?

21:56.609 --> 22:01.014
Yeah, I have, in fact, written a book from the point of view of a man, Alexander II.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.597
Now, that's a woman's name.

22:04.578 --> 22:06.981
Yeah, well... I'm looking at it right here.

22:07.502 --> 22:10.846
But it's narrated by a man named Claude.

22:10.866 --> 22:12.207
It's that sort of reverse Gothic.

22:12.247 --> 22:12.788
You know how...

22:13.190 --> 22:17.636
In the Gothic, a woman goes to a strange house where there's a man.

22:18.898 --> 22:20.440
Some kind of mysterious thing in the past.

22:21.502 --> 22:25.567
This is about a man who gets taken to a strange house with his women.

22:25.587 --> 22:26.549
Mysterious things in the past.

22:28.291 --> 22:30.334
Is there a sense of continuity in audio books?

22:30.494 --> 22:36.423
You mentioned that this is something that you see, which I can hear about five, six books, I guess.

22:37.484 --> 22:41.490
In some ways, I see myself struggling to get away from it, but there it is.

22:41.510 --> 22:41.610
Okay.

22:42.367 --> 22:45.133
I told my agent I'm going to give up on the gossip now, no more.

22:46.235 --> 22:48.118
And she just laughed.

22:48.138 --> 22:49.341
Are you working on anything?

22:50.163 --> 22:51.605
I'm kind of sketching around.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.495
I think I'll probably get started when this book tour is over.

22:56.515 --> 22:56.615
Yeah.

22:57.437 --> 22:59.481
Well, that's soon, I guess, right?

23:00.693 --> 23:04.701
Well, we have the book, which is always number one when I'm writing.

23:05.042 --> 23:08.087
We really haven't discussed it because it speaks for itself.

23:09.530 --> 23:11.133
I think I've got some nice quotes here.

23:11.153 --> 23:14.219
I do write for a couple of newspapers.

23:14.801 --> 23:17.065
I'm in Worcester and I'm in Quincy.

23:17.753 --> 23:23.102
Pretty good, and I have a couple of other papers that are starting to take my feature, too.

23:23.964 --> 23:24.064
Okay.

23:24.084 --> 23:25.166
Well, I hope we can help.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.468
Keep working.

23:26.488 --> 23:26.969
Thank you.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.031
Thanks a lot.

23:28.652 --> 23:30.295
Okay, take care, and I hope we meet again.

23:30.936 --> 23:31.718
Okay, good talking with you.

23:31.738 --> 23:31.898
Bye-bye.
