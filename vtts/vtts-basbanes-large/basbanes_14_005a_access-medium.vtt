00:02.900 --> 00:05.145
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:05.385 --> 00:07.971
A lot of authorities come to visit.

00:08.472 --> 00:15.487
I intended to phone with my friend.

00:15.687 --> 00:17.050
I beg your pardon, I'm sorry.

00:18.232 --> 00:22.782
I think last week when I was informed on your visit,

00:23.065 --> 00:26.832
And then I just intended to invite him.

00:27.013 --> 00:27.393
Oh, good.

00:27.554 --> 00:28.095
Go on.

00:28.175 --> 00:30.159
He can take the time.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.910
By chance, entirely by chance this morning, for one or two days in Milan, to stand there.

00:36.211 --> 00:41.159
visiting the library, and he visited already the art gallery.

00:41.580 --> 00:56.565
Now, do you have... I'm very sorry, I don't suppose it's this polite, but since it is 3 o'clock, the library and the art gallery will close at 5.30.

00:56.545 --> 01:06.521
and then how many times... We should be able to do what we have to do in that time, and if it's not sufficient, we'll come back tomorrow.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.945
But I think we can do it in that time.

01:09.085 --> 01:12.630
If so, since tomorrow we have a long meeting all the day.

01:13.452 --> 01:21.304
We are told now, and tomorrow you can visit along with your wife and introduce you in the art gallery.

01:21.520 --> 01:27.786
So we say, I suppose, at least half of time, because the art gallery is extremely wonderful.

01:28.207 --> 01:35.775
If I try to introduce you to that reflection, we will not survive, and tomorrow we cannot.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.157
OK, that's wonderful.

01:38.177 --> 01:40.459
You are very generous with your time.

01:40.479 --> 01:47.967
The art gallery starts on that side, and you will see, and there is the exhibit here of the book.

01:50.123 --> 02:11.642
Oh, I can order one?

02:12.196 --> 02:14.180
But this is the Italian edition.

02:14.220 --> 02:18.708
Good, I was also to buy one in Italian, but I'll wait for the English.

02:18.728 --> 02:19.971
It's just in print.

02:19.991 --> 02:21.414
Yes, it was wonderful.

02:21.434 --> 02:30.070
This is the art of the art gallery, but at the same time is the catalog.

02:32.632 --> 02:38.899
Father, was this established as a gallery and a library at the same time?

02:40.281 --> 02:41.863
We really found it.

02:41.883 --> 02:46.428
To have a look and then to go to the room, to the center and to the wall.

02:46.909 --> 02:48.991
This is the old statue.

02:50.573 --> 02:55.960
Sometime, in 1927, it was 511.

02:55.980 --> 02:59.584
It was the statue of Popeye Slamath.

03:00.256 --> 03:01.878
He was Librarian here.

03:01.898 --> 03:05.683
He was Librarian.

03:06.123 --> 03:12.251
He was Librarian here for 14 years.

03:12.271 --> 03:14.094
Wow.

03:14.114 --> 03:15.135
He died in 1939.

03:15.155 --> 03:20.762
Achillerat is almost famous because, for many reasons, he wrote the encyclical against the Nazis.

03:20.742 --> 03:44.334
I've read something about that recently, isn't it?

03:44.354 --> 03:44.935
That's been on the note, yes.

03:44.955 --> 03:45.696
You should see that, did you take it?

03:45.716 --> 03:45.936
I did, yes.

03:45.956 --> 03:47.138
You can put that away, I'll just keep this one in the next.

03:48.130 --> 04:13.327
Thank you.

04:13.347 --> 04:13.547
Thank you.

04:20.986 --> 04:46.605
This is called the Reading Room.

04:51.074 --> 05:15.411
Thank you.

05:19.070 --> 05:39.424
These people, mostly, I think, universities.

06:17.187 --> 06:31.762
I am.

06:31.782 --> 06:32.203
I'm sorry.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.245
It's a cross that was a cloister.

06:34.265 --> 06:37.428
The cross of the Renaissance Dominican monastery.

06:37.448 --> 06:40.551
It was a Dominican cloister.

06:40.571 --> 06:44.275
Now it's arranged in such a way.

06:44.660 --> 07:02.709
This is devoted to Pope Ratti Achillerati.

07:02.769 --> 07:09.199
We enter now.

07:09.500 --> 07:18.553
This is the old building created in 1609.

07:18.634 --> 07:19.875
This is 1609.

07:19.895 --> 07:30.411
This is 1609.

07:30.897 --> 07:36.324
Can we continue?

07:36.344 --> 07:43.775
The main reading room of the later version is called for painting down the end of nature.

07:44.636 --> 08:00.297
Actually, there are just those of us originally.

08:06.267 --> 08:33.388
21,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

08:56.403 --> 09:14.192
That book in English, was it that long?

09:29.444 --> 09:52.161
What is the nature of these books?

09:55.330 --> 10:01.721
It was created in 1609, from the Roman Empire.

10:01.741 --> 10:15.364
It came from one street of Milan, and the street was restored, and the monarch of the 4th century was a 4th century.

10:15.344 --> 10:19.751
The Forum Romanum, Roman Forum, is right down.

10:19.771 --> 10:23.276
The library has been built on the ground of the Forum Romanum.

10:23.697 --> 10:30.307
It means the center of the land is the side of the temple.

10:30.327 --> 10:33.752
It is built on the side of the Forum Romanum.

10:34.213 --> 10:39.501
The Forum Romanum is on the ground, the side of the temple.

10:39.521 --> 10:44.288
The heart of the temple was recovered when he was found in the temple seven years ago.

10:44.639 --> 10:55.293
discovered when you did the restoration.

10:57.816 --> 11:10.512
You could take pictures.

11:10.492 --> 11:19.163
Soren with one of the one of the systems.

11:19.363 --> 11:30.036
This is the perception of the scientific theory of the people in Israel, to each form only one man.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.060
Also, this is me.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.723
I can describe it elsewhere in the Bible.

11:37.070 --> 11:48.283
The original entrance was that one and the people entered on the south, like in China.

11:48.303 --> 11:49.985
The south gate is always the best.

11:50.826 --> 11:51.767
So this is 1609.

11:51.787 --> 11:52.228
1609.

11:52.788 --> 11:59.897
This is quite unbelievable.

11:59.997 --> 12:02.740
And these books, are they 17th century books?

12:02.973 --> 12:24.137
Most of our books are, but we changed the place now, according to the development of the century, so there are no books originally, they were moved from one side to another side during four centuries.

12:24.691 --> 12:37.207
I've never seen anything like that.

12:37.627 --> 12:45.417
M-A-M-G-O-N-E Fabio

12:45.970 --> 12:53.139
Do you call it a voltage ceiling and a voltage?

12:53.159 --> 12:54.881
We call that Botte.

12:57.645 --> 13:02.130
Botte is a big, contains wine.

13:02.851 --> 13:06.856
I don't know the name of it.

13:07.057 --> 13:08.398
We call it a wine cat.

13:08.859 --> 13:10.201
B-O-T-T-E.

13:10.781 --> 13:11.923
Botte.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.526
Botte.

13:15.451 --> 13:18.719
Was this all part of the restoration too?

13:22.708 --> 13:28.200
Was the original floor like this?

13:28.220 --> 13:29.764
No.

13:29.980 --> 13:36.190
But this was in the case that it was chosen by the sort of late 1933.

13:36.210 --> 13:38.153
Did you say the original was better?

13:38.173 --> 13:49.232
Oh yeah, I believe, I'm almost sure, because the man, Borromeo, was really one of the rights managers and the man said it had so much money for everything.

13:49.252 --> 13:56.764
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17,

13:57.740 --> 13:59.382
Eighteen shells on two levels.

13:59.742 --> 14:05.268
Eighteen rows of shells on two levels.

14:08.211 --> 14:10.133
Look at the color coming up, the light.

14:14.037 --> 14:16.620
This is worth the whole chest and alarm idea.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.261
This is really quite wonderful.

14:18.381 --> 14:21.465
Magnificent.

14:23.547 --> 14:25.789
Around the second war of the war.

14:27.980 --> 14:57.784
Did the original room have glass there too?

14:57.983 --> 15:09.680
How is this room for, did the books stay in good condition?

15:10.201 --> 15:15.368
Is the circulation good in here?

15:15.408 --> 15:23.620
It doesn't look like it.

15:23.802 --> 15:47.532
And you can see from this point, one can see the school of the Academy of Painting.

15:48.001 --> 16:07.782
and what was intended to be on that piece up there i wonder the date or i wonder

16:08.234 --> 16:22.490
I'll bet something, I'll bet there was an inscription or something.

16:23.011 --> 16:32.942
That's wonderful.

16:35.622 --> 16:56.466
But you made it to conform to the... You cannot have the idea of the richness

16:56.767 --> 17:03.862
you will have now the idea of the richness in another room, which was not restored except, and this is very modern.

17:03.962 --> 17:04.984
What does that say?

17:05.004 --> 17:17.290
It's just because one richest man of Milan in the year 1972, no, in 1972, he gave

17:17.827 --> 17:19.389
a lot of people.

17:19.409 --> 17:22.552
I'll take a picture without a flash, okay?

17:22.572 --> 17:24.895
This is just very modern.

17:24.975 --> 17:26.216
Just wait a moment.

17:28.258 --> 17:31.842
This is wonderful.

17:34.425 --> 17:47.479
That's the coat of iron.

17:47.982 --> 17:54.215
So two fields, one is to open and one to close.

17:54.876 --> 18:05.738
According to the gospel, Peter received the power to judge all the culture.

18:06.089 --> 18:15.162
the government, one of the powers to assault, I mean to open, or to condemn, to close.

18:15.322 --> 18:18.987
Is that a picture of the Ambrosiana?

18:19.007 --> 18:19.187
No.

18:20.029 --> 18:28.080
It's a picture of another church in which the library, given as a gift by this person,

18:28.280 --> 18:30.543
was before to come to us.

18:30.803 --> 18:31.284
I see.

18:31.304 --> 18:36.191
It's just Santa Maria preso Sanchez, so another choice.

18:36.211 --> 18:43.261
The name is before and then moved to us.

18:43.281 --> 18:46.826
And then the books are here now.

18:46.846 --> 18:47.507
This is it?

18:47.547 --> 18:48.348
More or less.

18:48.368 --> 18:51.472
We'll move the books of course from time to time.

18:51.492 --> 18:55.738
This is the very best of texts that I've found out here, but the edificio is still there before.

18:55.955 --> 18:58.018
Are these paintings period paintings?

18:58.038 --> 19:09.252
I mean, are they authentic to... Yeah, they are authentic of Gioglio, Paolo Gioglio, one of the painters of the... Paolo Gioglio, of the school of Gioglio.

19:09.272 --> 19:10.694
So these are 300 years old?

19:10.874 --> 19:11.935
Yeah, they are important.

19:12.836 --> 19:16.681
Very important because we can see the true fate of the people.

19:17.703 --> 19:21.928
Because the start of the retrace, of the portrait,

19:22.887 --> 19:31.976
portraits in the modern way, sort of in the center of those people.

19:31.996 --> 19:45.730
And I want to have the faith of the Lysanias, of Cardinals, of scientists, along all the Lysanias.

19:45.891 --> 19:51.156
If we have books, then the Cardinal has to have the faith.

19:51.828 --> 20:01.984
If we have a book of somebody, then we need all the paintings.

20:02.004 --> 20:08.214
The connection between the visual, the video, and the book.

20:08.234 --> 20:15.385
This was of course intrinsic to the fact that to have an Academy of Arts and a library.

20:15.745 --> 20:16.967
I've never heard of that before.

20:16.987 --> 20:19.371
If somebody gave you their books,

20:20.060 --> 20:22.503
Then you honored them by having their portrait painted.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.852
Just as you take pictures, it's precisely the same idea.

20:29.553 --> 20:45.696
So did all of these religious people have good, strong libraries?

20:46.013 --> 20:54.221
Yes, but those are not only religious people, politicians are businessmen.

20:54.261 --> 21:03.531
From all watches life.

21:03.591 --> 21:03.931
Yes.

21:04.832 --> 21:11.359
This is a modern life that is given by these people.

21:11.379 --> 21:14.502
Let's look.

21:15.325 --> 21:21.151
And did they, did they, they gave the money to do this too, probably?

21:21.171 --> 21:29.060
Yeah, they gave around 30 million dollars, 35, 40 million dollars, something like this.

21:30.461 --> 21:36.147
So this is an old noble family of... Not this one.

21:36.167 --> 21:37.629
No, no, no, this one I don't know.

21:37.769 --> 21:45.197
I'm talking about the money given by the bank, the bank of Milano, the bank of Milano for over seven years.

21:45.717 --> 21:50.141
Gave around every year $6 million every year.

21:50.161 --> 21:52.884
That's wonderful.

21:53.164 --> 22:02.953
Complete responsibility to the Lord.

22:02.973 --> 22:03.954
Would you describe that?

22:03.974 --> 22:14.985
What do you call that color?

22:15.005 --> 22:15.205
That.

22:15.425 --> 22:15.505
Huh?

22:16.278 --> 22:30.358
Aquamarine or pistachio, my wife thought.

22:37.187 --> 22:42.214
The decorations are extraordinary.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.918
Is that plaster or is that...

22:45.337 --> 22:52.152
carving in stone I wonder.

22:52.192 --> 23:00.049
That's amazing.

23:00.069 --> 23:03.497
Now let's compare our mission role.

23:19.643 --> 23:23.248
I see it.

23:23.268 --> 23:38.171
So this, in any case, just besides the library was the oldest apotheque of Milan.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.733
Apotheque, pharmacy.

23:39.753 --> 23:40.714
Apotheque?

23:40.734 --> 23:41.576
Apotheque of Milan.

23:42.497 --> 23:43.519
The Renaissance time.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.403
This will come from that place.

23:46.423 --> 23:48.486
Now we just walk around and we enter.

23:48.989 --> 24:00.001
Now it's a part of the library, but in the beginning, in the renaissance time, the 50th century was not a part of the library.

24:00.021 --> 24:02.363
It was the oldest pharmacy of the city.

24:03.144 --> 24:06.407
And the pharmacists were working fresh.

24:06.428 --> 24:11.573
Now it's our meeting room.

24:11.593 --> 24:13.495
I hope you enjoy the rest of the day.

24:15.432 --> 24:33.272
Do you have sprinkler systems in here?

24:33.438 --> 24:41.191
Just systems, fire prevention systems?

24:41.211 --> 24:42.794
Yes, yes.

24:42.814 --> 24:52.611
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:01.113 --> 25:01.654
Oh, I see.

25:01.674 --> 25:01.935
Good.

25:02.115 --> 25:07.025
Oh, they're very, very, you don't notice them.

25:07.325 --> 25:08.167
They're good.

25:08.187 --> 25:22.916
Let's draw all that veteran respiration.

25:22.936 --> 25:23.577
Thank you.

25:34.120 --> 25:45.797
Oh, look at the courtyard.

25:45.817 --> 25:59.036
We are now in between the art gallery, the library, and then all the court.

25:59.056 --> 25:59.277
Court.

26:01.560 --> 26:01.680
Court.

26:02.892 --> 26:18.015
I only suggest which kind of tree I want to do.

26:26.737 --> 26:55.107
Thank you.

26:57.736 --> 27:21.772
Thank you so much.

27:21.792 --> 27:24.757
Where do you see the manuscripts now?

27:24.777 --> 27:26.359
Do you have a vault for the manuscripts?

27:26.727 --> 27:52.903
To have like a big university institution for sciences and that

27:54.402 --> 27:59.973
So they were actually, that was part of the mandate to go out and find, to go out and collect money.

27:59.993 --> 28:04.241
He find many employers, many experts.

28:04.261 --> 28:07.147
He had a lot of money, but he don't have any problem for money.

28:07.568 --> 28:16.866
He find, over other words, professors, experts to buy manuscripts in Arabic,

28:17.133 --> 28:33.842
in Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Latin and from all other sciences, music, painting, medicine, architecture and theology of course, etc.

28:34.143 --> 28:37.347
What was the stimulus, do you think?

28:37.367 --> 28:38.448
What was the motivation?

28:38.969 --> 28:39.489
For him?

28:39.509 --> 28:39.690
Yes.

28:40.391 --> 29:02.277
Well, he had the intention, the idea of the Renaissance time that the man is the center of the universe and every human activity in art and science is, of course, the center of the human activity of the world.

29:03.083 --> 29:17.518
The sacred beauty was the idea of the Renaissance style, to have a harmony between all the sections of the universe, the spirit, the matter, the material reality.

29:17.538 --> 29:23.164
It is why the picture, sculpture, sculpture is matter, something is tall.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.286
It's just an example.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.129
Was this established, you think, as a

29:28.430 --> 29:34.538
He was himself a scholar, though he wrote all the books himself, this cardinal.

29:34.558 --> 29:39.104
He told all those theories in his books.

29:40.065 --> 29:45.031
Do you think this was his response to the Reformation at all, this library?

29:46.072 --> 29:58.268
In his idea, in a certain way, but he was a man of the spirit of the Renaissance, not so under condition of the Reformation.

29:59.345 --> 30:01.147
not moved by Ptolemy second.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.351
But almost as a reaffirmation in a way.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.097
Man of the Renaissance, don't take such idea.

30:09.117 --> 30:16.706
The Renaissance time is the glory of man, it's expressed by the Sistina creation of Michelangelo.

30:19.489 --> 30:23.614
So, all those are matters for the

30:24.033 --> 30:32.947
No, the idea of the harmony of the universe between God and man, the human reality.

30:32.967 --> 30:40.719
Tell us a little bit about this mural here, I guess it's a mural, right?

30:40.799 --> 30:47.330
This was the principal contemporary of Leonardo, Bernardino Willis, the author of that.

30:47.350 --> 30:48.792
Really?

30:48.812 --> 30:50.074
And the pharmacist.

30:50.324 --> 30:58.472
the cooperative group of the pharmacists there and they paid him to create that wonderful.

30:58.492 --> 31:03.697
So this painting is how old?

31:04.538 --> 31:09.242
1492, something like that.

31:09.282 --> 31:16.990
We are at that place where those people were working, selling the medicine.

31:17.510 --> 31:20.045
So this was a pharmacist's shop?

31:20.206 --> 31:20.427
Yes.

31:20.648 --> 31:23.082
No, the pharmacist's laboratory.

31:23.197 --> 31:28.462
They met and they fell to the people of Milan.

31:28.503 --> 31:33.608
Those are the pharmacists.

31:33.768 --> 31:40.575
They played Bernardino and Winnie to have a letter as a symbol of their power.

31:40.595 --> 31:44.839
The painters were always using them as a symbol of power.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.822
Patronijai, they called them.

31:47.142 --> 31:49.204
This was all from Patronijai.

31:50.129 --> 31:53.298
How many volumes would you say you have here?

31:54.061 --> 32:04.712
Well, the last evaluation is less than half million for 416,000.

32:07.207 --> 32:10.950
What would you say your special strengths are in?

32:11.591 --> 32:13.032
The area?

32:13.052 --> 32:19.058
Your special strengths, what would you say the collection is especially strong in?

32:19.078 --> 32:36.353
And that man, really many many things, the history of the arts, arts history, many arts, including music, culture, and of course the

32:37.143 --> 32:40.168
Oh, I see.

32:40.288 --> 32:43.893
Eastern studies in 90 years.

32:43.953 --> 32:57.814
One main idea of the Calvary and the Pounder, when we have the largest Yemenite collection of Arabic manuscripts from Yemen, for example.

32:57.834 --> 32:58.696
Really clear.

32:58.716 --> 33:02.982
2000 Arabian Arabic manuscripts from Yemen.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.321
And are they used?

33:06.222 --> 33:10.887
We show you the back catalogs.

33:10.907 --> 33:21.339
We are, of course, in contact with the universities of Egypt, Jordan, Iran, Israel.

33:21.359 --> 33:22.240
2000.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.522
And at what period, roughly?

33:24.982 --> 33:31.990
Well, we began from, for example, those are just a part of the Arabians who we have, Islam Yemen.

33:31.970 --> 33:43.484
We have an old copy of the Koran of the 9th century, for example, and many of you will see now the picture.

33:44.405 --> 33:46.628
What would you say is the most precious?

33:47.690 --> 33:53.657
I don't mean in terms of money, that's ridiculous, you can't put a price on these things.

33:53.941 --> 33:57.286
but in terms of what would you say are the most treasured?

33:58.668 --> 34:12.608
It's very difficult to have so many... For example, the library has contained the...

34:12.892 --> 34:24.991
of a big volume depicted in the 4th century in Alexandria.

34:25.011 --> 34:35.828
And then the oldest example of the art of Alexandria of Egypt.

34:35.960 --> 34:59.672
and presumably it comes from Alexandria because the library of Alexandria was buried by sire many times by Julius Caesar and Antonio during the war of Cleopatra and then in 14th century by the series of Alexandria, the bishops of Alexandria

34:59.652 --> 35:10.103
He was a woman, the librarian at that time, also put to the fire by a century.

35:11.324 --> 35:12.425
Who was put to the fire?

35:12.485 --> 35:13.927
A librarian?

35:14.267 --> 35:17.310
The librarian.

35:17.891 --> 35:24.758
I'm writing about librarians too.

35:24.778 --> 35:27.921
Did you say that a librarian was executed?

35:28.103 --> 35:41.586
The library go to fire in Alexander, but this work was at the time of Cyril or Alexander.

35:42.788 --> 35:45.412
Is it?

35:45.813 --> 35:45.893
Yes.

35:45.873 --> 35:49.118
...was fired in the Library of Alexandria.

35:49.138 --> 35:59.733
But some books come here from the area of Alexandria, and though we can presume that we have some books from Alexandria, a very old library.

35:59.973 --> 36:01.635
In fact, we have.

36:01.916 --> 36:02.677
You said so?

36:02.737 --> 36:11.329
No, because the people were sent to the Monastery of Santa Caterina of Egypt, to Cairo and to Jerusalem, to buy our books.

36:12.070 --> 36:15.475
So our books came, actually, and were bought by the Cardinals,

36:15.792 --> 36:18.015
And they came from that region.

36:18.356 --> 36:20.859
So he sent agents out to buy books.

36:21.099 --> 36:27.668
He sent people to Egypt and to, at least not only to Egypt, but for that case, to Egypt.

36:27.688 --> 36:30.893
Were they booksellers or were they priests?

36:31.393 --> 36:32.014
No.

36:32.855 --> 36:33.897
Travelers.

36:33.917 --> 36:34.658
How do you tell?

36:34.678 --> 36:35.479
I don't know.

36:35.579 --> 36:38.583
People, they granted to go.

36:38.764 --> 36:44.972
They were able to make contracts and they were also experts.

36:45.155 --> 36:48.779
for those languages and they buy excellent books in fact.

36:50.902 --> 36:57.289
Some of them with the money simply never come back.

36:57.309 --> 36:58.931
Will we be able to see a few things?

36:59.412 --> 37:01.334
Will you be able to show us a few things?

37:01.754 --> 37:03.897
And this is not allowed.

37:03.997 --> 37:08.002
I already asked for the permission but this is not.

37:08.362 --> 37:13.288
But the reproduction we can see in the reading library now, the reading room.

37:13.538 --> 37:29.728
There was an idea of Virgilius which was formed by Francesco Petzalca, the great man of our time.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.709
That's correct.

37:30.850 --> 37:31.671
His books are here?

37:31.992 --> 37:35.378
He said Francesco Petzalca lived some years in Iran.

37:36.100 --> 37:45.797
He wrote himself a note when Laura died, he wrote himself a priest.

37:46.418 --> 37:51.527
I know now that Laura died.

37:52.064 --> 37:54.708
51,000 pages.

37:55.009 --> 37:59.916
Can we see anything?

38:00.057 --> 38:01.980
We will display the next year.

38:02.040 --> 38:07.128
Actually, only the copies we can try to see.

38:07.648 --> 38:09.972
The library opened two weeks ago.

38:10.120 --> 38:22.335
and there are a lot of visitors and we cannot supply all the extra requests because there are a lot of crowd of people asking so much.

38:22.415 --> 38:29.583
This is why also Monsignor Ravaze asked me to receive you on SBI also.

38:30.044 --> 38:32.507
Sure, this is wonderful.

38:34.849 --> 38:37.933
I can't believe you inspired me.

38:38.572 --> 38:40.674
Was it always exposed?

38:40.754 --> 38:42.035
Was it always visible?

38:42.356 --> 38:43.617
Or was it ever covered up?

38:45.759 --> 38:54.508
During the war in the war, during war in the war, too, this was fire and it was safe.

38:54.568 --> 38:58.412
They put some defense and it was safe.

38:58.952 --> 39:01.815
And this was fire.

39:01.835 --> 39:05.659
Look upstairs, there's time out over here.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.046
What does that say up there?

39:09.428 --> 39:14.093
His head, the head of the king, Capet Regis.

39:14.934 --> 39:20.901
King of head, of glory, Gloria, of glory.

39:21.001 --> 39:22.143
Regis is the king.

39:22.823 --> 39:23.945
Capet is the head.

39:24.746 --> 39:32.895
Capet because this is the crown of the... You see Jesus having a crown on his beard.

39:33.213 --> 39:37.137
crown of the pick.

39:37.678 --> 39:39.019
Thorns we call them.

39:39.580 --> 39:40.421
This is the crown.

39:40.681 --> 39:47.508
And then skin is coronate means is crowned by the skin.

39:47.528 --> 39:54.276
The thorns, we call them thorns.

39:54.296 --> 39:56.298
Thorns.

39:56.318 --> 40:02.224
I don't know that this word is... H-O-R-N

40:02.710 --> 40:07.099
Yeah, so much.

40:07.540 --> 40:16.197
Coronato is the crown, Gloria is the glory, and then the head of the king of the glory.

40:16.801 --> 40:19.044
is crowned by Trump.

40:19.665 --> 40:21.447
Now how do you know which painter did this?

40:21.507 --> 40:23.150
Did he sign it?

40:23.230 --> 40:25.593
Just the records indicate that he did it.

40:25.633 --> 40:29.358
This is the fresco.

40:29.378 --> 40:38.370
And then it's first dressed on the walls and then immediately painted by the technique of the fresco.

40:39.987 --> 41:03.210
and it lasted all these years to me the fresco remains for thousands of years

41:03.781 --> 41:16.170
Will you have the name of somebody I can call at the Capitula Library in Verona tomorrow?

41:17.737 --> 41:47.676
In Italy there are actually

41:47.842 --> 42:02.981
We call that not church library, ecclesiastical library because church library has a different juridical meaning.

42:03.522 --> 42:06.025
So we don't use church library.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.587
Church is another juridical body.

42:07.907 --> 42:11.672
Ecclesiastical library is our expression.

42:11.956 --> 42:15.902
And what's the total number of books?

42:17.284 --> 42:23.994
27 million.

42:24.775 --> 42:24.996
Wow.

42:25.116 --> 42:27.439
112,000 manuscripts.

42:27.559 --> 42:33.588
And 1,469 ecclesiastical libraries.

42:34.229 --> 42:35.972
And this is the book which is...

42:36.323 --> 42:45.854
The annual, yeah, annual, they published by... Did you have this book?

42:45.874 --> 42:55.665
Yeah, because the association published, it's just, it's a co-write for the editors, the editor for the writing.

42:57.447 --> 42:58.488
Yeah, exactly.

42:58.508 --> 42:59.850
Yeah, exactly.

43:02.933 --> 43:03.214
Yeah, exactly.

43:03.234 --> 43:05.056
Yeah, exactly.

43:05.076 --> 43:06.077
It's a new...

43:08.251 --> 43:14.079
And this is this channel right here.

43:14.540 --> 43:16.563
Luciano, L-C-I-A-N.

43:16.623 --> 43:18.205
What is the ISBN?

43:24.273 --> 43:25.615
Look at that, so 8-8.

43:25.755 --> 43:32.525
This is just the number, the International Statue of the Bibliotheism.

43:32.605 --> 43:34.147
Yes, but that identifies the book.

43:34.468 --> 43:36.250
I can now find this book.

43:38.879 --> 43:44.489
She worked strongly for that.

43:45.110 --> 43:57.092
Everything is on the database.

44:00.938 --> 44:03.503
Small libraries have one

44:03.483 --> 44:10.892
Extremely ancient and decorative manuscripts in every library has at least one treasure.

44:10.912 --> 44:22.486
Cambogiano has a lot, but there are divided in many... Every library has at least one treasure.

44:23.507 --> 44:26.571
That's right.

44:26.753 --> 44:36.730
Maybe if you could show us a few more things before they close, because we're probably going to go to parole tomorrow.

44:55.897 --> 45:00.726
Thank you.

45:58.570 --> 46:27.598
I tracked the library until...

46:31.308 --> 46:32.851
at the library until his death.

46:33.712 --> 46:35.496
That's the provenance.

46:35.516 --> 46:41.126
After 1374, a family of Petrarch's friend Dundee d'Aloravoglio Viscondi family.

46:42.789 --> 46:43.750
Probably going to work out.

46:43.771 --> 46:52.086
So that's the provenance in possession of the Latimafé, who after his death was purchased by the bibliothèque in Brajama.

46:52.106 --> 46:53.468
So it was purchased by...

47:05.159 --> 47:19.523
I have written any civil rights.

47:45.811 --> 47:46.709
have to be

48:09.284 --> 48:23.161
What is your title?

48:23.181 --> 48:23.783
My name is Dr. Richard Boston.
