00:01.938 --> 00:24.570
Okay, so if you've got an archetype at one end of the spectrum for digital books, and it might be Cornell, which is really interested in extremely high-quality images and, for example, the ability to replicate back to paper as well as the ability to go online,

00:25.664 --> 00:35.599
we're kind of in the middle, where we're juggling images, although our images are imperfect, and we're juggling text, although our texts are imperfect.

00:35.619 --> 00:52.465
At the other end of the spectrum from Cornell, there's an activity which usually sort of comes under the term electronic text, and it's involved scholars, and a central feature of it is what's called, is a...

00:54.335 --> 00:58.301
a set of guidelines and a standard called the Text Encoding Initiative.

00:58.361 --> 01:01.866
The Humanities Endowment has funded the Text Encoding Initiative.

01:01.886 --> 01:11.339
There's a guy at the University of Chicago named Michael Sperberg, S-P-E-R-G, S-P-E-R-B-E-R-G hyphen McQueen.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.646
And Michael Sperberg McQueen, and there's people elsewhere that are involved in the Text Encoding Initiative.

01:16.666 --> 01:22.114
And the idea there is, and their tool is...

01:22.432 --> 01:27.237
Standard Generalized Markup Language, or S-G-M-L.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.581
M, M like Mike.

01:30.621 --> 01:33.464
Standard Generalized Markup Language.

01:33.484 --> 01:37.288
And their idea, they too have modified.

01:37.368 --> 01:38.550
I'm sort of going back.

01:38.670 --> 01:43.675
But their archetype wasn't to get the book artifacts back on paper.

01:43.775 --> 01:45.317
You know, Cornell wants to get...

01:45.888 --> 01:47.630
give me back the book on paper.

01:47.730 --> 01:48.471
Which, in fact, they do.

01:49.071 --> 01:49.832
They actually do.

01:49.852 --> 01:49.972
Right.

01:49.992 --> 01:50.312
Okay.

01:50.352 --> 01:56.458
Sperberg, McLean, and the Text and Coding Initiative's archetype is, I care not about the book.

01:56.859 --> 01:58.901
You know, it's merely ink on paper.

01:59.521 --> 02:04.887
I want the text, you know, the sacred text, as it were, that's within the book.

02:05.948 --> 02:12.894
And they use this SGML in order to retain things that aren't just in the letter forms.

02:12.914 --> 02:15.557
In other words, you need to know

02:16.162 --> 02:21.269
which parts of the text were emphasized, which is marked by bold or italics.

02:21.329 --> 02:24.754
You need to know where the chapters are, whatever it is.

02:25.254 --> 02:26.556
So you need to add markup.

02:28.258 --> 02:37.731
And you can also annotate or interpret, and you can embed annotations, but they're separable because you've used the markup language to make them separable.

02:38.172 --> 02:42.017
So there's this whole shtick about the text qua text,

02:43.313 --> 02:58.027
I mean, I can imagine someone trying to do a definitive Shakespeare play in that way, in which the markup language takes each line and tells you how it appears in all of the different folios.

02:58.087 --> 02:59.829
Anyway, so it's for text analysis.

02:59.929 --> 03:04.353
It's had a lot of historical connection with linguistics.

03:04.373 --> 03:11.920
There's been a huge amount of work done in Greek and Latin classical studies with this SGML markup and text markup.

03:12.878 --> 03:18.545
There must be a lot of literature on it.

03:19.326 --> 03:19.446
Yeah.

03:19.466 --> 03:23.031
Well, one place is Ask David Seaman when you're down there.

03:23.131 --> 03:34.646
Another place is there's something called the Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities, C-E-T-H, which is jointly run by Rutgers and Princeton, and they have a newsletter.

03:36.649 --> 03:39.392
The Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities.

03:42.359 --> 03:47.951
And what was interesting to us, and we actually have a paper online at our website.

03:47.991 --> 03:53.202
If you look at our background papers, there's an electronic text paper off the American Memory homepage.

03:53.222 --> 04:00.537
The American Memory homepage has background papers listed at the bottom, and we actually had a conference on this subject and wrote a

04:01.141 --> 04:05.787
a proceedings document which has names and addresses in it, so you can try to find that.

04:06.007 --> 04:07.168
What do I look for?

04:07.188 --> 04:08.790
Where on the webpage?

04:08.810 --> 04:30.777
On the American Memory homepage, if you scroll down, at the bottom of the American Memory homepage, there's a thing you can click called Background and Technical Papers, or Technical and Background Papers, and it's a menu, and somewhere on that menu is the proceedings of this

04:31.162 --> 04:55.566
conference in 1992 but yeah there you go and and you sort of have these archetypes now they've all modified their archetypes uh you know whereas the cornell people started image only now they've got texts they started going back to paper only now they go online well by the same token spurberg and mcqueen and those guys started out saying no no no images

04:56.035 --> 04:58.117
and now they're ready to embrace images.

04:59.379 --> 05:01.421
Well, I think there's a certain amount.

05:02.222 --> 05:06.527
Our 1992 report is maybe a little earlier.

05:06.907 --> 05:15.998
But the interesting thing, and one of the ways that David Seaman—oh, the other thing was, with SGML, it's software independent.

05:16.018 --> 05:16.318
Really?

05:17.359 --> 05:19.342
It's a markup language.

05:19.362 --> 05:23.106
It's really like compositors' markup.

05:23.508 --> 05:31.162
It meant that if you have software that you like, you can load the file into it, and then you can do whatever you want because you're using your software.

05:31.763 --> 05:32.965
David's very good on this.

05:33.486 --> 05:43.684
But what they've started doing now is they've started imaging books at Virginia, and they image in a way that mixes what we do and what Cornell does.

05:43.864 --> 05:44.866
They use a cradle.

05:44.926 --> 05:46.208
They're doing first editions.

05:46.308 --> 05:47.811
They're not destroying them.

05:48.972 --> 05:51.575
But they're making really high-quality images.

05:51.655 --> 06:00.403
I mean, he's making 500 dot per inch full-color images of pages that, to you and I, are black ink on white paper.

06:00.463 --> 06:01.924
I mean, it isn't quite white paper.

06:02.105 --> 06:03.606
It's brownish paper, you know?

06:04.687 --> 06:09.572
But he's doing what I would call museum artifact photography.

06:10.453 --> 06:15.958
So if Cornell is the archetype of the book as a replicable object,

06:16.782 --> 06:21.587
You know, he's the archetype for imaging of the book as museum artifact.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.590
At least that would be my buzzword, you know.

06:24.670 --> 06:31.777
And again, we're somewhere in the middle, you know, trying to have, you know, the book as accessible artifacts.

06:32.498 --> 06:38.624
Also into the electronic tech stuff and SGML markup and a lot of nuances, and I got it right.

06:38.824 --> 06:41.166
Okay.

06:41.186 --> 06:42.047
You're very generous.

06:43.192 --> 06:45.695
Have you been in the Stacks?

06:46.236 --> 06:46.916
I haven't been.

06:47.197 --> 06:50.361
Can you take me down?

06:50.981 --> 06:56.148
Chief Collections Management Division.

06:56.368 --> 06:59.291
I'm in charge of General Collections.

06:59.311 --> 07:03.356
Are you familiar with the library and the different custodial divisions and how they operate?

07:03.416 --> 07:07.101
Yes, but I've not actually visited the Stacks at all.

07:07.221 --> 07:10.785
The General Collections are primarily housed in the Jefferson House.

07:11.508 --> 07:16.898
And they constitute about 10 million volumes in most subjects.

07:17.339 --> 07:25.594
Book typing through, books bound for the article, printing through, in almost every subject in L.C.

07:25.634 --> 07:28.499
classification, except through law and music.

07:29.461 --> 07:33.769
There's a separate law library, except for music, right?

07:35.892 --> 07:43.240
As I said, there are about 10 million volumes in the collection, and the collection is increasing with a net rate of about a quarter million volumes a year.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.442
We've got printed books, though.

07:44.462 --> 07:48.546
Printed books in the general collections are coming in at the rate of about 1,000 a day.

07:49.708 --> 08:00.820
So we still have a lot of books, and that could not be changed or radically... So if it's a quarter of a million books, and we only publish 55,000 books in the United States,

08:01.137 --> 08:04.262
That leads me to believe that you're going to get 200,000 books from offshore.

08:04.663 --> 08:07.287
Well, plus bound periodically.

08:07.347 --> 08:08.309
Right.

08:08.990 --> 08:09.691
But you are a major.

08:09.711 --> 08:10.973
We do have a large collection.

08:11.173 --> 08:12.175
That's right.

08:12.555 --> 08:16.502
And it's part of the mandate of the library to do that.

08:19.106 --> 08:20.048
Are you a librarian?

08:20.108 --> 08:20.348
Yes.

08:22.051 --> 08:24.715
We've got books in...

08:24.813 --> 08:26.475
Most languages are general collections.

08:26.495 --> 08:29.197
Most European languages, Cyrillic, alphabet.

08:29.217 --> 08:41.090
There is a separate Asian division, which has Japanese, Chinese, Korean, separate African, Middle Eastern division, Hebrew, Hebraic, and other collections.

08:41.110 --> 08:53.402
Obviously, our challenge is to store and serve an ever-growing number of books that are not rapidly being replaced by other media.

08:53.956 --> 08:58.563
So for at least the foreseeable future, we're probably going to continue at 1,000 books a day.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.508
And so when 1,000... All right.

09:02.068 --> 09:02.529
Okay.

09:02.549 --> 09:03.731
We anticipated the question.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.474
1,000 books come in.

09:05.554 --> 09:07.357
Does that mean 1,000 books must leave?

09:07.977 --> 09:13.025
At this point, we are what we consider overflowing.

09:13.846 --> 09:21.398
We had some guidelines that we developed years ago on when we consider the stacks to be functionally full, which means

09:21.783 --> 09:23.786
you can kind of manage your collection.

09:23.866 --> 09:25.449
It doesn't mean that every shelf is 100% full.

09:25.509 --> 09:28.253
If there's been a classified collection, that's open in the world.

09:29.435 --> 09:36.927
So how do you think about 80 to 85% would be functionally full?

09:36.947 --> 09:41.193
I mean, beyond that, you really have to spot a lot of major shifting.

09:41.213 --> 09:48.685
And since collections don't grow equal, you know, on subject, you have to do a lot of shifting and spend a lot of money.

09:49.559 --> 09:53.504
I'm doing that just to accommodate your holdings.

09:53.625 --> 09:57.350
Once you get beyond 90s, you consider that kind of catastrophic.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.353
I mean, it's just, you can't do it.

09:59.493 --> 10:01.776
Books appear on the floor on top of other books.

10:02.938 --> 10:05.081
There isn't enough space elsewhere to make things for sure.

10:07.204 --> 10:11.209
And, uh... It's not like finding space for one more book.

10:11.550 --> 10:15.335
No, I mean, you have to because your classes grow at a very different rate.

10:16.857 --> 10:17.558
And...

10:18.196 --> 10:21.440
You know, you can't just keep putting books on the end of any shelf in this space.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.441
It's got to be in order.

10:23.962 --> 10:26.405
This is a Jefferson building, which is the old building.

10:28.567 --> 10:34.013
And you've been in the main room, don't you?

10:34.033 --> 10:34.554
Yes, I have.

10:34.574 --> 10:35.135
Many times.

10:35.195 --> 10:35.655
Many times.

10:35.675 --> 10:37.397
So you've been in the main room?

10:37.417 --> 10:38.659
No, I've got a neoplate here.

10:39.059 --> 10:39.399
Right.

10:39.920 --> 10:48.169
So this building, when it was built, houses probably five million volumes.

10:48.554 --> 10:50.457
And this is a Jefferson building.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.299
This is a classic L.C.

10:52.359 --> 10:52.820
building.

10:55.524 --> 10:56.865
I'll take you up to the spot.

10:57.386 --> 10:59.609
That will be a treat.

10:59.669 --> 11:08.581
We've been trying to get off-site storage for years.

11:09.783 --> 11:14.950
And finally, we are to get space out of 14 units.

11:15.335 --> 11:22.444
And we're planning to build a number of modules there, but the first module would be four book-type materials.

11:22.524 --> 11:23.826
Let's come down for the honor.

11:23.846 --> 11:25.248
Will this be the Harvard model?

11:25.468 --> 11:27.671
It's the Harvard model.

11:29.874 --> 11:34.440
So we have a lot of instructions and field trips with Harvard to build the theater.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.284
That's just something to see, isn't it, how they put that thing?

11:37.304 --> 11:37.584
Oh, yeah.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.787
And they're in their fourth module.

11:39.807 --> 11:41.369
Will it be done in the same manner?

11:41.429 --> 11:45.194
I mean, they stay shown strictly by size and barcode.

11:45.355 --> 11:49.240
I mean, it's the same.

11:49.981 --> 11:57.891
So we're going to build a module that's about, you know, I think it's about 12,000 square feet in this module and holds about 2.7 million volumes.

11:58.132 --> 11:59.193
That's about eight, yeah.

12:00.034 --> 12:01.356
And then we have four meters.

12:01.640 --> 12:05.526
which is geographically how far from here.

12:05.846 --> 12:11.815
And so how are you selecting the material?

12:11.895 --> 12:13.117
Oh, I'm jumping ahead.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.242
So we're now in the stacks, right?

12:17.484 --> 12:20.989
There were several things that went into our decision-making process.

12:21.069 --> 12:21.790
We're in the stacks.

12:21.970 --> 12:25.676
This is all across my collection.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.819
I'll take you to a deck that's not a great show.

12:27.839 --> 12:29.301
You can see we're crowded.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.727
books are on the floor, books are on top of others.

12:31.747 --> 12:34.012
What do you mean by classified collections?

12:35.214 --> 12:41.947
This is class P. I mean, all of our collections are in classified order by subject.

12:42.067 --> 12:47.658
And this is P, which is part of language and literature.

12:48.860 --> 12:51.846
But basically, our shelter

12:53.362 --> 12:57.867
This is what we want to avoid desperately, and this is what we could not avoid.

12:57.887 --> 12:59.369
Here's a book lying flat.

12:59.389 --> 13:10.983
Well, we're on the floor, and we're trying shifting projects, but in order to shift, we have to have some other space shifting.

13:11.063 --> 13:12.605
But those books, they're on the floor.

13:12.645 --> 13:14.307
If somebody asks for that book,

13:14.590 --> 13:17.313
Are we going to know that it's on the floor over here?

13:17.333 --> 13:20.676
No, you have to kind of look on the floor, and that's part of the problem.

13:20.776 --> 13:21.818
You're not on shelf space.

13:21.898 --> 13:24.620
So actually, that's kind of their home there.

13:24.781 --> 13:26.402
They're not waiting to be shelving.

13:26.422 --> 13:27.684
Well, there's no place to shelving.

13:29.225 --> 13:34.190
So we try to do shifting projects, and a lot of these decks are actually moving material around.

13:35.051 --> 13:39.976
But these are examples of how much shelving you can do.

13:39.996 --> 13:43.500
You've got very crowded areas, and you have areas with a little bit of shelf space.

13:43.717 --> 13:45.119
Sometimes it's a deck away.

13:45.879 --> 13:50.985
And to constantly do this, you have staff and the facilities to do it.

13:51.105 --> 13:53.909
But these are, this is the Jefferson Inn for example.

13:53.929 --> 13:56.672
These are not the worst of the crowded decks, but it's an example.

13:57.633 --> 14:00.156
And how many levels like this do you have?

14:02.058 --> 14:08.345
These decks, actually in this building, there are about between 10 and 13 levels above each other.

14:08.445 --> 14:09.666
And they're double decks.

14:10.427 --> 14:10.808
I see.

14:11.248 --> 14:12.930
When the building was first built,

14:13.045 --> 14:15.949
In 1897.

14:16.390 --> 14:21.737
In 1897.

14:21.857 --> 14:26.203
It's 100 years old this year, the Jefferson Building.

14:26.384 --> 14:33.954
You had decks like this, and then a number of years later, in the early 1900s, they decided they needed more space.

14:33.974 --> 14:39.282
There was a deck like this on the north side and on the south side, parallel up the reading room.

14:39.782 --> 14:41.024
These are called decks.

14:41.044 --> 14:41.685
Decks, yeah.

14:41.935 --> 14:43.598
They built the other decks.

14:43.658 --> 14:46.042
They took part of the quartet to build these twin decks.

14:46.062 --> 14:48.226
So that's why you have double decks on each one.

14:48.246 --> 14:50.770
Are these the original shelves?

14:50.910 --> 14:51.271
Pardon me.

14:51.612 --> 14:52.132
Easy Heist.

14:52.293 --> 14:53.274
Easy Heist.

14:54.116 --> 14:55.558
These are what?

14:57.922 --> 14:59.405
Carnegie Steel.

14:59.425 --> 15:00.447
Oh, okay.

15:00.507 --> 15:01.128
They're lovely here.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.572
All that.

15:04.582 --> 15:12.971
The answer to the question on how we selected material is a... We have several things going at the same time.

15:12.991 --> 15:18.718
We did this plan three or four years ago, and we had several things that went into our decision making.

15:18.858 --> 15:22.622
First, we really needed blocks of space.

15:22.802 --> 15:32.833
By that I mean we needed a whole deck, because we had a lot of reading room shifted with the renovation, the Asian Division reading room, the African reading room,

15:32.999 --> 15:35.382
moved over to this building, from Adams to Jefferson.

15:35.943 --> 15:40.970
The microphone reading room is moving from here, from Jefferson over to Adams.

15:41.491 --> 15:48.181
So what we needed was blocks of space so we could move those collections to be near the reading rooms when they changed buildings.

15:48.241 --> 15:52.287
So we were not interested in just printing the collection, taking a few books from each shelf.

15:52.307 --> 15:55.271
We were actually interested in creating major blocks of space.

15:55.291 --> 15:59.577
Now, I'm looking at a book, Lewis, How to Read Better and Faster.

15:59.637 --> 16:02.922
Two volumes, two copies of that book.

16:03.205 --> 16:05.648
Okay, that's right.

16:05.668 --> 16:07.450
So actually four copies.

16:07.470 --> 16:07.871
Right.

16:07.891 --> 16:11.415
So are two or three of these copies candidates for going off to Fort Meade?

16:11.435 --> 16:12.576
That would be, yeah.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.679
Now, we have a two-phase plan.

16:14.699 --> 16:25.231
The first phase was we needed to move a lot of material very quickly because we have to get out, and we have stuff on the floor, and as I said, a thousand items in the collection.

16:26.293 --> 16:29.837
So we really have to, and we're way behind off-site, so...

16:29.969 --> 16:35.236
One of the things we decided to do was take entire classes, I said classes, of material for off-site.

16:35.757 --> 16:38.320
This is very different than what Harvard's done.

16:38.340 --> 16:44.649
I mean, Harvard, each library that's contributed to the Harvard facility has kind of taken older material, lesser-used material.

16:44.669 --> 16:46.171
But they're changing in a way, too.

16:46.191 --> 16:46.412
Yeah.

16:46.772 --> 16:50.417
We literally are taking entire classes and subclasses.

16:50.557 --> 16:54.963
So we expect all of Class S, which is agriculture, to go off-site.

16:54.983 --> 16:55.584
And why is that?

16:57.206 --> 16:59.149
It's one of the lesser-used classes.

16:59.602 --> 17:05.148
There's a National Agricultural Library, and we need large blocks of space.

17:05.168 --> 17:08.131
So we want to take entire classes to make large blocks of space.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.434
Part of the medicine class is moving off-site.

17:11.454 --> 17:13.957
Because the National Library of Medicine is less than used material.

17:14.698 --> 17:16.279
Fiction is moving off-site.

17:16.299 --> 17:21.865
So we have a plan to move material by entire classes.

17:21.985 --> 17:25.429
There are several other reasons why we chose that approach.

17:25.449 --> 17:28.512
First of all, it's not as labor-intensive.

17:29.167 --> 17:35.613
If we were to go through this collection, we're talking about 1,000 items a day every day for the rest of our lives, you know, basically.

17:35.633 --> 17:37.135
My life here.

17:37.655 --> 17:43.181
It's very labor-intensive to pull a book here and to decide, well, this is something you might want to copy to.

17:43.261 --> 17:44.542
This is something you don't.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.564
This is a less-used book.

17:47.305 --> 17:50.108
So if you were to do that, I mean, it would take a long time to do it.

17:50.128 --> 17:52.650
By taking an entire class or subclass, literally, we can move.

17:52.670 --> 17:56.374
We're planning on the first two and a half years to move 4,000 items a day.

17:56.855 --> 17:58.296
When is Chris here?

17:58.546 --> 18:00.990
Right now it's the summer of 1999.

18:01.110 --> 18:03.133
My book is coming out in 1999.

18:03.513 --> 18:05.055
I'll be back in touch.

18:05.636 --> 18:06.518
Are you starting?

18:06.538 --> 18:09.502
The trucks will roll in here and you'll be loading 4,000?

18:09.522 --> 18:13.888
4,000 items a day, every day, for two and a half years.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.233
And to get out there.

18:17.513 --> 18:17.874
Wow.

18:18.395 --> 18:26.546
And the other reason is because right now we're in a program to get an integrated library system.

18:26.567 --> 18:27.608
We've never had one yet.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.558
That's a library term.

18:30.179 --> 18:34.904
But we don't have very good inventory control on our collections.

18:34.944 --> 18:38.569
There's no automated inventory control system.

18:38.649 --> 18:40.651
Everything we do is manual.

18:40.671 --> 18:43.935
There's this manual shuffle from the fifth floor of the Madison building.

18:43.955 --> 18:49.361
It has 12 million cards in it that tells you what you're supposed to have and how many copies.

18:49.381 --> 18:53.366
But there's nothing in an automated database.

18:53.887 --> 18:55.789
Have you used our databases here?

18:56.444 --> 19:16.808
That means if you're interested in Lewis's How to Read Better and Faster, you can go into the catalog, into our automated system, and you can look up Lewis, or you can look up under the title How to Read Better and Faster, or probably the subject, you know, reading, and you can find this book.

19:18.470 --> 19:18.750
Great.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.473
And what you can find, what it doesn't tell you,

19:22.246 --> 19:28.196
is how many copies we have, whether it's in circulation, whether it's on the shelf, or anything else.

19:28.277 --> 19:30.761
Well, it's not inventory control.

19:30.781 --> 19:31.703
It's bibliographic.

19:31.943 --> 19:33.766
Bibliographic may tell you the author's title.

19:33.786 --> 19:37.833
It'll tell you we have an item, Gone with the Wind, you know, How to Read Better.

19:38.134 --> 19:39.917
It'll tell you that we have that title.

19:40.387 --> 19:45.315
It doesn't give you any information on the location or how many copies.

19:45.395 --> 19:46.738
There's no peace level.

19:46.758 --> 19:49.142
It's what we call the inventory control part of it.

19:49.502 --> 20:00.240
And again, to use this as an example, not knowing anything about it, let's say this is a very important book and he wrote a preface in this edition, but which was not in this one.

20:00.861 --> 20:04.808
Or maybe he wrote something really important and showed up in this one that wasn't in this one.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.493
This database is not going to indicate any of that.

20:07.553 --> 20:12.678
It's just going to indicate it's just going to give you off the title, subject, you know, the place of publication.

20:12.698 --> 20:14.260
That's right.

20:16.423 --> 20:21.589
So basically, you know in the reading room that we have this title and this author.

20:21.609 --> 20:28.416
What you don't know is whether it's on the shelf, how many copies we have, or any of that type of information.

20:28.456 --> 20:31.280
An integrated library system is supposed to give us that information.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.462
A lot of public libraries and universal libraries have that.

20:34.167 --> 20:43.378
You can go and you can call up this title and it's going to say it's available in this branch and that branch and it's out in circulation or it should be on the shelf, all of that.

20:43.819 --> 20:57.595
So part of our concern when we started selecting materials that determining what was going to off-site storage had to do with the fact, how do we capture this information without an integrated system?

20:57.675 --> 21:00.939
And we're not going to have an integrated system for quite a few years.

21:01.179 --> 21:02.221
I mean, they're working on it.

21:02.241 --> 21:03.482
We're going to procure one.

21:04.357 --> 21:16.310
But if you're in the reading room, and just follow the scenario, because they're not great service for the scenario that we're really concerned with, and you, let's say we send this book off-site.

21:16.330 --> 21:20.074
Let's say it's only one copy of it.

21:20.335 --> 21:23.698
You're in the reading room, and you say, aha, I found how to read better.

21:24.159 --> 21:31.407
In the database, you go to the desk, you submit a call slip, you wait 45 minutes, you get a note on children.

21:31.427 --> 21:33.469
We have no way of knowing this book is off-site.

21:34.057 --> 21:35.960
You have no way to know this book is website.

21:35.980 --> 21:44.992
We have another system, our circulation system, which is an automated system, but it's not tied into our bibliographic database.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.177
So you come up to the desk and say, well, gee, I really need this book.

21:48.197 --> 21:49.379
I came from out of town.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.802
You could find it for me.

21:52.243 --> 21:55.888
We can go into our circulation file and say, aha, that book is in website storage.

21:56.268 --> 21:58.532
Would you like us to order it for you?

21:58.552 --> 22:03.118
But we would much rather people know that up front before they sit in the reading room and wait or all that.

22:03.503 --> 22:13.456
By sending entire class and subsets at this point, all of class S, if somebody orders a book in class S, as soon as they submit the call, we have a sign on the computer.

22:13.837 --> 22:22.529
If your book starts with an S, it's an off-site storage, please see a reference librarian or a technician, and we can tell you how we can get it for you from port meetings and all that.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.993
What do you think the turnover, the turnaround time for port meetings?

22:26.874 --> 22:32.582
We are operating on the premise that we're going to get a very responsive service, that we're going to have twice daily delivery, and

22:33.119 --> 22:37.985
It's one of the reasons we've avoided terms like remote storage, secondary storage.

22:38.005 --> 22:51.360
We're talking about off-site storage or high-density storage because we were really adamant that we wanted a facility that would be nearby, you know, within the ability to do a twice-daily round trip.

22:51.660 --> 22:52.401
And Fort Meade is.

22:52.461 --> 22:54.644
We can do a morning trip.

22:54.684 --> 22:55.765
Who owns the property?

22:55.785 --> 22:58.668
It's the Department of District of Defense.

22:58.688 --> 23:02.653
It's a military base, and it was a downsized military base, so they had some space.

23:03.038 --> 23:08.364
They transferred the property to the architecture.

23:08.384 --> 23:10.347
How much room do you have for modules?

23:10.647 --> 23:11.348
It's a lot of room.

23:11.568 --> 23:15.012
So, I mean, conceivably you can build 20 modules if you want.

23:15.032 --> 23:15.913
We can build 70.

23:15.973 --> 23:18.076
I mean, Harvard has space for 10, right?

23:18.096 --> 23:19.377
Yeah, we can build more.

23:19.938 --> 23:21.419
Well, that's good to know, isn't it?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.862
Over a long period of time.

23:23.882 --> 23:24.042
Right.

23:24.062 --> 23:26.245
Our current plan is to build a module over two years.

23:27.524 --> 23:34.834
So hopefully after the one that opens in 1999, if that's on schedule, there'll be another one in 21, 21, 23, 25.

23:35.314 --> 23:43.045
And when is the Fort Meade one opening?

23:43.065 --> 23:46.990
Supposedly summer of 99, the first module.

23:47.070 --> 23:50.655
At that point, 4,000 books a day.

23:50.675 --> 23:52.337
4,000 books a day.

23:52.638 --> 23:56.603
Five days a week, two and a half years to get a lot of this out.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.640
So what are you going to do for the next year and a half?

24:00.061 --> 24:00.662
After that?

24:01.062 --> 24:03.606
What are you going to do between now and the summer?

24:03.626 --> 24:09.254
Well, we're probably going to get in the next few years a half a million books that we have to make space for.

24:09.574 --> 24:09.795
Here?

24:10.095 --> 24:10.716
Here.

24:11.798 --> 24:14.862
And that's why they're on the floor, and that's why we're doing a lot of...

24:15.263 --> 24:19.589
Shifting, we're trying to double-shell, all kinds of creative things that we can do.

24:19.609 --> 24:29.041
When you press like this... It's a very great discomfort level for us, I can't believe, because we have sprinkler heads, and you don't want those sprinkler heads on the sprinkler heads.

24:29.061 --> 24:42.199
It's not a... You know, from a preservation point of view, a preservation office could tell you a whole bunch of things, but, you know, when you have books on the floor, that's a real problem as far as

24:42.938 --> 24:43.819
You know, being kicked.

24:43.919 --> 24:47.383
I mean, just the normal stuff, but water damage.

24:47.423 --> 24:54.751
When you have books that are very tightly packed on the shelf, people tend to pull them by the top and they're very tight and they rip through the top.

24:55.051 --> 24:57.273
They damage the book.

24:57.794 --> 25:03.980
There are areas you don't see even here where if you had a few taller books just to get an extra shelf, you've turned the book down.

25:04.020 --> 25:06.703
That damages the block.

25:06.723 --> 25:08.305
So there are a lot of preservation issues.

25:08.723 --> 25:13.648
One of the real upsides, I don't know if you've talked to me about Fort Meade and I'll say about our plan.

25:16.512 --> 25:26.202
We are designing, as far as we know, the state-of-the-art environmental system for that facility.

25:26.603 --> 25:33.671
We're building in everything to preserve the book, to preserve the physical item.

25:33.691 --> 25:37.515
The facility's going to be kept at 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

25:38.373 --> 25:41.236
which is much cooler than here, obviously.

25:41.256 --> 25:42.638
But it's excellent for paper.

25:42.658 --> 25:44.279
I think that's cooler than Harvard, too.

25:44.359 --> 25:45.821
Yes, it is cooler than Harvard.

25:45.841 --> 26:01.978
Thirty-five percent of all the humidity, special lighting, so it doesn't emit any harmful rays, sodium vapor lamps, very effective vapor barrier, air exchanges, dust-free environment, special floor covering.

26:02.079 --> 26:03.880
So it's just going to cost you a little figure on that?

26:03.900 --> 26:05.342
I don't have the exact figure on that.

26:05.744 --> 26:06.807
and what it's going to cost.

26:06.827 --> 26:18.403
And actually, the first module is going to be more expensive than the second, third, fourth, and fifth because we're building a lot of common loading dock and processing the work area staff area and all that.

26:18.721 --> 26:22.066
I mean, I can give you a figure, but I don't— Don't run the boat.

26:22.086 --> 26:22.927
I'm just curious.

26:23.027 --> 26:24.710
I'd say it's in the $4 million.

26:24.730 --> 26:26.232
It's not something like that.

26:26.332 --> 26:27.474
No, it's not.

26:27.494 --> 26:28.114
It's a warehouse.

26:28.135 --> 26:28.615
It's a shop.

26:28.896 --> 26:33.182
I mean, the real money is in making sure the environment is what we want.

26:33.322 --> 26:35.425
It's not a lot of money at all.

26:35.465 --> 26:40.092
No, and it's really going to be very, very close to—that's the construction course.

26:40.112 --> 26:42.375
I mean, that's the staffing and forklifts and all that.

26:42.395 --> 26:43.817
That's the National Library.

26:44.135 --> 26:48.919
And so, you know, the security out there is going to be much better, obviously.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.925
We're going to have high-level security, motion detectors, cameras, intrusion detection.

26:55.305 --> 26:58.008
Are you going to have any special collections out there?

26:58.028 --> 26:59.009
Any rare stuff?

26:59.089 --> 27:01.411
Not in the first module.

27:01.451 --> 27:07.177
There's discussion in the second module of having paper-based products that are not booked.

27:07.277 --> 27:10.800
And that would be things like maps, sheet music, and the scripts.

27:11.185 --> 27:16.295
That would obviously have a higher level, although the facility is going to be secure.

27:16.315 --> 27:21.125
I mean, are Harvidsons, the whole libraries and stuff that are departing here?

27:21.205 --> 27:25.294
Well, it's going to be secured, and it's on a military base.

27:26.416 --> 27:27.739
I don't think so.

27:27.959 --> 27:30.364
There won't be any public facilities out there.

27:30.384 --> 27:32.248
I mean, it's purely a work area.

27:33.022 --> 27:35.206
And I think Harvard is comparable to that.

27:35.466 --> 27:40.755
Yeah, Harvard is kind of, excuse me, Harvard, because the faculty were too free to send the books out there.

27:40.995 --> 27:41.977
They wanted a reading room.

27:42.037 --> 27:42.338
Right.

27:42.658 --> 27:45.022
So it's a coffee mess is what it amounts to, you know.

27:45.383 --> 27:47.206
But nobody ever goes out there to read.

27:47.226 --> 27:48.148
They don't allow it, you know.

27:48.248 --> 27:52.134
You know, we actually at one point talked about people going out there.

27:53.396 --> 27:54.338
And...

27:55.482 --> 27:56.623
Yeah, there are frozen kinds.

27:56.703 --> 28:00.227
If you have a scholar or a librarian, they want a whole bunch of stuff, isn't it better?

28:00.288 --> 28:03.411
If they're willing to go and try to transport, especially brittle material.

28:03.471 --> 28:05.554
You might have to have a curator there.

28:05.574 --> 28:09.298
You might have to have a copy machine.

28:09.979 --> 28:17.267
But the decision was taken away from us because I guess part of this transfer from the military, since it is on a military base, is no public facility.

28:17.688 --> 28:19.430
So that's part of the need of the transfer.

28:19.470 --> 28:20.711
So that decision was kind of made for us.

28:20.731 --> 28:21.452
It was made for us.

28:21.532 --> 28:22.333
It was taken out of our head.

28:22.600 --> 28:39.721
The one thing we are planning that Harvard does not have at this point, or at least didn't have the last time I went up there, was some level of content support services, because we are sending newer material.

28:39.821 --> 28:44.768
We are sending a lot of periodicals.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.789
Newer material, yeah.

28:46.149 --> 28:52.337
Yeah, because once we send, our premise now is once we send a class out, like Class S, like I have a poster,

28:52.621 --> 28:56.746
Any item that comes in here in agriculture and process is going directly out to Fort Meade.

28:57.607 --> 29:00.870
So it could be a 1997, at that point a 1999 item.

29:01.291 --> 29:02.712
That's generally not what Harvard does.

29:02.753 --> 29:03.914
But we also serve Congress.

29:03.934 --> 29:05.616
Ken was doing the same thing, though.

29:05.656 --> 29:09.360
He told me brand new stuff is going on.

29:09.380 --> 29:09.861
I said, really?

29:09.941 --> 29:10.722
Then why buy it?

29:10.962 --> 29:12.323
Because this is a private institution.

29:12.343 --> 29:13.525
This is not the Library of Congress.

29:14.165 --> 29:18.190
And he said, I was concerned I might have the same response from the administration.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.525
Because we didn't.

29:19.545 --> 29:20.346
Not a peep.

29:20.366 --> 29:24.031
Because there are certain things we know that we're buying it because we have to buy it.

29:24.131 --> 29:24.411
Right.

29:24.731 --> 29:27.475
And it may be necessary to have it.

29:28.215 --> 29:30.138
But there's no demand for it now.

29:30.238 --> 29:32.160
It goes straight out of the cell phone, you know?

29:32.380 --> 29:38.708
But we're not, unless it goes in a reference collection, even if you know there's demand, it's in one of those classes where a suspect is going after.

29:38.768 --> 29:43.013
So it's not an intellectual, this is probably something we should have, but.

29:43.887 --> 29:47.952
But I was saying, we also want to provide a very responsive reference service.

29:47.992 --> 29:53.418
We obviously have to provide highly responsive service to our top of the client, to Congress.

29:54.159 --> 30:04.090
So we are prepared to do photocopying of articles, look up something, faxing of things, which is something Harvard did not do.

30:04.110 --> 30:05.592
I mean, they deal with a physical piece.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.045
And we understand we've got a deal.

30:08.125 --> 30:14.513
If somebody needs an article for Congress, an author, a researcher, immediately on a rush request, we're willing to do that.

30:14.533 --> 30:20.160
That's going to have to involve the—you don't have to have a specialist out there, a librarian or a student.

30:20.180 --> 30:20.800
Well, maybe a technician.

30:20.820 --> 30:28.269
If they give us a citation of Sports Illustrated, you know, whatever it is, an article— Okay, but I mean, like the fellow whose name escapes me at the moment, Ron Lane.

30:28.670 --> 30:30.432
Ron Lane.

30:30.732 --> 30:38.703
I don't care if they send me the Gutenberg Bible, it's got a barcode on it, and it's in a box, because I don't know what the hell is in the box.

30:39.524 --> 30:41.587
We're not quite that extreme.

30:41.827 --> 30:43.589
Maybe he's being cute.

30:43.730 --> 30:44.931
No, he's not.

30:45.372 --> 30:47.615
He runs a superb facility.

30:48.055 --> 30:49.217
They never lose books.

30:49.898 --> 30:53.863
I mean, if he puts you through the whole process, they check, they double-check, they triple-check.

30:53.883 --> 30:55.025
I was totally impressed.

30:55.045 --> 30:57.448
It is a magnificent process, but...

30:58.306 --> 31:02.191
It is a total non-library setting, and Ron could be dealing with snakes.

31:02.291 --> 31:04.494
Ron's background is in the warehouse.

31:04.514 --> 31:08.059
Yeah, he could be dealing with shoeboxes, and that's fine.

31:08.079 --> 31:26.322
A lot of that's what we're going to do as a warehouse, but we really believe we cannot negate the other part of it, which is we do have to provide service, and we really are prepared, not professional reference service, but

31:26.622 --> 31:34.074
technician level reference, looking for articles, looking for, you know, being able to fax something in or that.

31:34.094 --> 31:36.298
And they've actually talked about that.

31:36.338 --> 31:40.725
If you ever watch a videotape at Harvard, they've actually talked about it.

31:40.745 --> 31:47.136
They don't do it, but they've talked in the past about maybe doing photocopying or faxing or, you know, if the libraries need that.

31:47.737 --> 31:50.101
Do they provide a videotape for people?

31:50.341 --> 31:50.521
What?

31:50.541 --> 31:51.583
There is a videotape.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.493
Harvard has a video tape?

31:53.513 --> 31:54.254
They have a video tape.

31:54.274 --> 31:57.339
It's kind of a promotional video tape.

31:57.359 --> 31:59.702
Well, I mean, do they invite?

31:59.722 --> 32:01.725
I don't know why we're selling it.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.368
I don't know why we're selling it.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.411
Yeah, because they're cost recovery.

32:05.451 --> 32:06.672
That's what I would think.

32:06.712 --> 32:09.256
They're probably selling their plans.

32:09.276 --> 32:12.661
They're selling, you know, they charge the service.

32:12.701 --> 32:13.863
Yep, tell me about it.

32:13.883 --> 32:18.530
Yeah, I mean, they charge storage and they charge the transaction.

32:18.630 --> 32:21.975
Yeah, they charge storage fee and they charge the transaction fee.

32:22.445 --> 32:24.527
To the actual units of the university.

32:24.808 --> 32:25.048
Yeah.

32:25.328 --> 32:26.389
He calls them customers.

32:26.990 --> 32:27.691
The customers.

32:28.011 --> 32:33.917
They charge for the new price, you know, how much material you have in each hole, each return.

32:34.037 --> 32:40.665
And in fact, if you are in the law school and you want a book today, it's going to charge you a hundred bucks.

32:41.405 --> 32:42.587
Otherwise, you'll get it tomorrow.

32:42.967 --> 32:43.708
Yeah.

32:43.888 --> 32:48.653
They charge you a hundred bucks from your account to my account to bring it in today.

32:48.713 --> 32:49.414
Yeah.

32:50.018 --> 32:53.083
And they have a whole free schedule for that.

32:53.143 --> 32:54.445
Obviously, we don't.

32:54.505 --> 32:55.607
That's not what we're doing.

32:56.088 --> 32:58.812
But we do have to provide service.

32:58.832 --> 33:04.681
Ron is very quick to point out, and I really believe this, that nobody likes immature field science.

33:04.701 --> 33:06.204
And we've gone through this.

33:06.324 --> 33:07.526
And we had the same.

33:08.367 --> 33:13.736
When we tried to select what was going out, it was always, well, something obviously has to go out.

33:13.756 --> 33:15.739
We have finite space that looks on the floor.

33:15.989 --> 33:17.752
You know, and I know you have to send something.

33:17.792 --> 33:20.135
Now let me tell you why my collection should not go.

33:20.255 --> 33:25.583
You know, it's always, you know, yeah, we have to cut the budget, but let me tell you why it shouldn't be my budget.

33:25.603 --> 33:28.687
Well, Ken's, Ron is not in that book.

33:28.747 --> 33:29.408
That's Ken's.

33:29.989 --> 33:30.510
Yeah.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.513
And they have, he's worked with the faculty.

33:32.533 --> 33:32.653
Right.

33:32.673 --> 33:34.015
They've set up the criteria.

33:34.135 --> 33:39.423
And the success Ron's had is that they have a superb operation.

33:39.563 --> 33:44.410
If they started losing books or not, you know, not be able to do next-day delivery...

33:45.065 --> 33:46.446
there would be problems.

33:46.466 --> 33:51.911
And we've told the people here, look, the book is not going to be here for browsing.

33:51.931 --> 33:55.034
But if you order in the afternoon, we're going to have it in the next day.

33:55.054 --> 33:59.859
If you order it in the morning or the end of the afternoon, and let me tell you the advantages of the facility.

33:59.879 --> 34:00.459
It's secure.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.923
It's got a state-of-the-art environmental control.

34:03.983 --> 34:13.772
And if you really care about the physical item, you want to protect it from deterioration or somebody just grabbing it or a sprinkler has it, the facility is going to be much better

34:14.258 --> 34:19.204
physical, environmental security protection than you would have here.

34:19.284 --> 34:21.607
And for a lot of people, that's very important.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.250
And once again, I'm under the gun.

34:23.290 --> 34:24.731
We have to produce.

34:24.892 --> 34:27.095
You can say we're going to do twice the end of delivery.

34:27.115 --> 34:27.815
We've got to do it.

34:28.637 --> 34:40.692
So, you know, it's... You're going to have another 500,000 new arrivals here by the time the Fort Meade departs are open.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.776
Is this kind of...

34:44.161 --> 34:50.286
encourage is not the correct word, but persuade you that maybe some books can do the accession.

34:51.888 --> 34:53.669
Well, why do you throw you loose in that?

34:53.689 --> 34:59.514
And I don't talk about it a lot, because I know Dr. Burns doesn't like the accession.

34:59.534 --> 34:59.935
But it happens.

34:59.955 --> 35:01.176
You know, we do some.

35:01.256 --> 35:04.839
I mean, there are things that go out of scope.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.983
You know, I mean, we have done an inventory of the collections.

35:09.123 --> 35:10.684
I don't know if you know anything about our inventory.

35:10.704 --> 35:12.666
Oh, I'd like to know about that.

35:13.186 --> 35:14.368
Yes, I would very much.

35:14.588 --> 35:20.176
The library never really did item-level inventory collections.

35:20.196 --> 35:23.501
And in the 1970s, there was a group of people.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.945
Do you want to sit over your case just a minute?

35:26.706 --> 35:27.367
Oh, fine.

35:27.387 --> 35:27.748
You're right.

35:27.768 --> 35:32.234
In the 1970s, the group of people got together to talk about the not-on-shelf rate.

35:32.355 --> 35:35.619
In fact, they had this not-on-shelf rate.

35:35.659 --> 35:38.063
NOS, not-on-shelf, is the term we used.

35:38.482 --> 35:44.467
When somebody asks for a book, requests a book, and it's not on the shelf, you get a response back that says, not on the shelf.

35:45.829 --> 35:49.012
And it could be not on the shelf for a variety of reasons.

35:49.032 --> 35:50.593
There was a lot of criticism back then.

35:50.633 --> 35:53.916
Well, the staff doesn't look for the book, you know, and all that.

35:54.517 --> 35:57.199
There are probably other reasons that it looks like not on the shelf.

35:57.219 --> 35:59.661
There are a lot of reasons for books not on the shelf.

35:59.681 --> 36:00.322
Some of them are good.

36:00.362 --> 36:01.183
Aretha's using them.

36:01.203 --> 36:02.264
I mean, it's in circulation.

36:02.304 --> 36:03.104
That's a positive.

36:03.184 --> 36:04.065
I mean, we're a library.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.026
We're not a warehouse.

36:05.707 --> 36:07.068
You know, our books are for use.

36:07.148 --> 36:08.269
So it's really good...

36:08.654 --> 36:11.777
when people are using our material.

36:12.738 --> 36:21.566
But, of course, if you're coming with a reading list, a group of people coming with a reading list, the first person gets a book, the other is getting an on-shelf report because the book is gone.

36:22.587 --> 36:36.720
But one of the things that was very clear is that we never did an inventory, in recent memory, we never did an inventory of collections, an item-by-item account, what we had, what might be somewhere else.

36:36.869 --> 36:39.393
And we figured there were a lot of reasons.

36:40.334 --> 36:42.978
Not only use, but something's a miscatalog.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.763
How could you possibly inventory 115 million items?

36:46.783 --> 36:51.510
Well, we started doing it in 1978, and we haven't finished it yet in 1997.

36:51.891 --> 36:53.553
So it's a long process.

36:53.633 --> 36:54.234
So where are you?

36:54.274 --> 36:56.978
And we're only dealing with a book collection.

36:56.998 --> 36:58.320
So 10 million.

36:58.340 --> 36:59.822
Roughly 10 million at this point.

37:00.342 --> 37:01.564
We've almost finished.

37:01.804 --> 37:02.965
We've almost finished.

37:03.025 --> 37:04.287
The first pass through.

37:04.307 --> 37:13.879
Yeah, but I'm going to say, by the time you're finished, you'll have another four or five million items that have to... So it's obviously going to be an ongoing... So what can you tell me about that?

37:13.919 --> 37:18.344
What we try to do is several things during this inventory.

37:18.364 --> 37:23.310
First of all, we try to account for every copy of every title.

37:23.591 --> 37:28.577
Now, there is this thing that I told you about, these 12 million card shufflers...

37:28.996 --> 37:36.345
It looks like a card catalog, but it's arranged the same way books are arranged on the shelf.

37:36.365 --> 37:40.931
They're in classified order, unlike an author title or a subject catalog.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.314
It's by calling.

37:43.334 --> 37:49.221
And not only does it have a card for each title you're supposed to have, but it also tells you how many copies.

37:49.862 --> 37:51.103
Copy one, copy two.

37:51.504 --> 37:58.092
It also tells you if the copy is somewhere else, like a rare book or something like that, if there's another assignment.

37:58.628 --> 38:10.732
So we literally had a staff that goes to the shelf with a shelfless tray and also the circulation file, because that was before the M1 made the circulation file, so they had a manual little thing of slips.

38:11.594 --> 38:17.927
And they'd go through and they'd say, gee, we had PN 83, I 84, 19, I copy 2, copy 1.

38:17.947 --> 38:18.628
Do we have it?

38:19.739 --> 38:21.701
They're doing this for all 10 million books.

38:21.721 --> 38:23.203
They did this for all 10 million books.

38:23.223 --> 38:23.883
How many people?

38:25.025 --> 38:27.487
Well, at one point, we were at our prime.

38:27.507 --> 38:29.870
We had about 30 people doing this.

38:30.310 --> 38:31.692
And now we have about 10 people doing this.

38:31.772 --> 38:32.192
Every day.

38:32.413 --> 38:34.975
Because we lost a lot of people.

38:35.056 --> 38:36.337
Yeah.

38:37.178 --> 38:43.505
And what they were trying to do, first of all, if a book was brittle or something, they were trying to put out preservation stuff.

38:43.525 --> 38:44.486
We had binding slips.

38:44.546 --> 38:45.206
We had preservation stuff.

38:45.226 --> 38:47.409
Did you have numbers on brittle books?

38:47.469 --> 38:47.569
Yeah.

38:47.988 --> 38:49.390
Not, no.

38:49.450 --> 38:49.751
Percentages?

38:50.452 --> 38:51.233
Do you have an idea?

38:52.395 --> 38:53.797
It depends on what's brittle.

38:53.997 --> 38:58.964
You know, we got this whole thing about fold tests, how many times you can turn the corner down before it breaks.

38:59.064 --> 39:00.266
What kind of a test?

39:00.286 --> 39:00.767
Fold.

39:00.907 --> 39:06.235
You know, something called a fold test, where you would actually, if you can, you know, turn it.

39:07.216 --> 39:13.626
The preservation has things where if you turn down a corner and it breaks after a certain period of time, then it's brittle.

39:13.766 --> 39:14.367
It's brittle.

39:15.055 --> 39:16.517
And I just noticed the folds there.

39:16.537 --> 39:17.759
And this one had a fold.

39:17.779 --> 39:19.181
I just actually opened to a fold.

39:19.242 --> 39:20.524
Yeah, I saw that.

39:20.544 --> 39:26.473
But if it breaks off after a certain period of time, it's a certain period.

39:26.493 --> 39:35.847
We have books that are just extremely adaptive cases, you know, literally.

39:35.868 --> 39:38.892
But did that make them candidates for deacidification?

39:38.952 --> 39:41.957
Well, probably more microfilming.

39:42.427 --> 39:48.276
You can't bind them, and deacertification, supposedly, is... I talked to those people yesterday, yeah.

39:48.296 --> 39:50.259
It's not a paper-strengthening process.

39:50.279 --> 39:52.081
It's supposed to slow down or stop.

39:52.141 --> 39:55.206
The paper's supposed to be working on something... Some strengthening.

39:55.226 --> 39:59.352
But this is... Our premise is we're not going to strengthen these things.

39:59.372 --> 40:01.816
But we did a lot of things in the inventory.

40:01.836 --> 40:02.697
Number one...

40:03.217 --> 40:09.224
we identified items needing binding, labeling, or probably microfilm.

40:09.625 --> 40:24.804
Number two, we replaced... Years and years ago, if you had soft-covered books or pamphlets that were not bound, that could not be bound, they were in something called a gay line.

40:25.204 --> 40:28.028
They were like these red folders.

40:29.369 --> 40:31.452
We replaced them all, but they were kind of

40:31.769 --> 40:39.099
like a red binder with a gray box, and then you would sew these things in or paste them in.

40:39.119 --> 40:48.771
And they were high in acidity, so they destroyed— Oh, okay.

40:49.212 --> 40:52.116
They destroyed the collection of hydrogen.

40:52.556 --> 40:57.363
And so we replaced these.

40:57.383 --> 40:59.345
These are all acid-friandes.

40:59.425 --> 41:01.388
I'm going to write down this title while you're talking.

41:01.722 --> 41:08.328
They're all acid-free, and so they won't destroy the book.

41:08.368 --> 41:15.515
Perhaps more importantly, we embarked upon a shelf marker project.

41:15.535 --> 41:28.807
And what a shelf marker is is a piece of cardboard with a facing stock on it that takes the place of the book on the shelf where it's supposed to be.

41:28.827 --> 41:29.828
I'm listening.

41:29.848 --> 41:30.328
So...

41:30.865 --> 41:44.604
This was very important to us because it told you if a book was not on the shelf, why it was not on the shelf.

41:46.446 --> 41:49.630
And I'm just looking for examples.

41:49.650 --> 41:54.477
For example, if a book is listening to you,

41:55.199 --> 42:08.402
Which means when we did this inventory, that specific time in history when we sat down here and we had the card looking for the book, the book was not on the shelf, we made up a shelf marker for the book.

42:09.143 --> 42:12.288
And this shelf marker took the place of the book.

42:12.308 --> 42:20.903
So if somebody wants Warren Schatz, Reading for Self-Education, his call number, this is specific copy three,

42:21.170 --> 42:24.574
We could tell them that this is missing an inventory.

42:24.594 --> 42:29.079
This book was noted as missing an inventory on November 24, 1982.

42:29.139 --> 42:31.062
This is a standard form.

42:31.262 --> 42:33.965
You got any around that I could have?

42:34.306 --> 42:35.287
I can get you.

42:35.307 --> 42:35.667
Do you mind?

42:36.008 --> 42:36.708
No, not at all.

42:37.289 --> 42:38.350
Can I give you my card?

42:38.631 --> 42:44.798
No.

42:47.343 --> 42:48.765
This was kind of interesting.

42:48.785 --> 42:50.528
I'll tell you two things about it.

42:50.548 --> 42:53.572
It's probably more about inventory than you want to know.

42:54.293 --> 43:00.762
This gave us what we consider a positive response to give to a reader who wanted this book.

43:00.782 --> 43:06.030
Because before we had shelf market, or somebody ordered this book, they would get back and not on shelf before.

43:06.050 --> 43:11.217
They would come up to the desk, they would say, gee, you know, what does this mean?

43:11.297 --> 43:13.420
I got this slip back, and it says, not on shelf.

43:14.041 --> 43:15.243
I said, that's what they said.

43:15.263 --> 43:16.725
I don't know.

43:17.077 --> 43:24.345
Maybe in circulation, somebody might be using it in the reading room, might be missing an inventory, might be missed shelves.

43:24.365 --> 43:25.126
That's not very helpful.

43:25.947 --> 43:28.610
You know, I mean, someone could put in a special search.

43:28.630 --> 43:37.100
But this way, if we could tell the person, this book, no, it's not on shelf, but it's missing an inventory, it's been missing an inventory, and we put the date on the call slip, 1983.

43:37.661 --> 43:43.708
At least we're telling the person, don't come back tomorrow, don't come back next Saturday, resubmit a call slip.

43:43.728 --> 43:45.750
And we do have people on the staff who will

43:46.203 --> 43:47.985
do a special search.

43:48.005 --> 43:50.688
We'll try to find another location that has the book.

43:50.708 --> 43:54.833
It might be Catholic University, American University, but we could actually try to find the book somewhere else.

43:54.893 --> 43:59.118
Now, I hope this is for somebody like in Congress, because this is not for the general reader.

43:59.138 --> 44:00.239
This is for the general public.

44:00.259 --> 44:04.964
I mean, we will try— We would hope that the general public would go to the other facility and— Well, yes.

44:05.144 --> 44:11.772
But if they're here and they say, well, gee, I really need this book, we can look at national catalogs and other things and try to find another library.

44:12.157 --> 44:21.708
So even though they're not getting a book with something like this, we do consider a much more positive response, like we know what we're doing, other than just not on shelf to say it's missing in inventory.

44:21.728 --> 44:23.030
We know that.

44:23.110 --> 44:26.574
Can we help you find another spot to get the book?

44:26.654 --> 44:29.518
Now, did we finish the question on deaccession?

44:29.538 --> 44:32.982
You said, I know Dr. Bollinger doesn't like to discuss that.

44:33.082 --> 44:34.363
We're a national library.

44:34.443 --> 44:35.685
We don't do a lot.

44:35.725 --> 44:36.886
We do do some.

44:37.006 --> 44:39.089
I started saying with the inventory.

44:39.449 --> 44:40.851
There were criteria.

44:40.891 --> 44:41.792
There were certain criteria.

44:42.143 --> 44:49.372
categories of material that are out of scope that we might have collected at one point that are now considered out of scope.

44:49.392 --> 44:50.893
Can you give me an example?

44:51.454 --> 44:51.815
Yeah.

44:52.215 --> 44:57.141
And every time, I can say, every time, when we did the inventory, we did it class by class.

44:57.181 --> 45:01.746
So we did class E, and then we did class B, and then class P, and all that.

45:02.968 --> 45:07.233
We went to the collections policy, collections development people, and we were recommending them.

45:07.253 --> 45:08.735
So we said, okay, we're going to do this.

45:09.736 --> 45:11.458
Can you recommend, you know, give a,

45:11.675 --> 45:16.401
They gave us criteria for what we should be looking at weeding out.

45:16.781 --> 45:20.106
Now, in certain cases, it was multiple copies.

45:20.466 --> 45:31.139
We might have collected a large number of copies, and at one point, we decided in certain classes we only keep one copy of a foreign language and two copies of English language material.

45:31.159 --> 45:36.366
So if we had foreign language copies two and three, or we had English language copies two and three,

45:36.987 --> 45:39.870
we might have discarded them, weeded those out.

45:39.890 --> 45:40.851
Of the same edition?

45:41.171 --> 45:42.672
Yeah, the same edition.

45:42.692 --> 45:43.153
Is it good?

45:43.753 --> 45:45.215
Multiple editions?

45:45.235 --> 45:47.036
No, we keep them.

45:47.056 --> 45:49.498
And I think there's an example of this, how to read fast and better.

45:49.518 --> 45:52.361
This is two copies of one edition, two of the other.

45:52.701 --> 45:58.967
Even if I said copies two and three, if we couldn't find a copy of one, we would keep two copies, so we would keep copies of three.

45:58.987 --> 46:04.412
So we would weed out copies above a certain number.

46:04.763 --> 46:08.027
For example, we went to class L, which is education.

46:08.567 --> 46:13.012
They told us to generally weed out high school yearbooks.

46:13.693 --> 46:15.094
We weren't keeping high school yearbooks.

46:15.114 --> 46:19.799
At one point, I guess, years ago, we collected some high school yearbooks.

46:19.819 --> 46:21.901
So what happened to them?

46:21.962 --> 46:26.787
They're generally sent to exchange and gift.

46:26.807 --> 46:32.593
More recently, we've had projects in medicine where we've gone through and started

46:32.843 --> 46:35.826
reducing some of the copies.

46:36.166 --> 46:45.015
Yes, and in that case, we actually offered these to the National Library of Medicine, and then the things they didn't warrant, we sent down this change in gift.

46:45.035 --> 46:48.258
But we had a cooperative project with the National Library of Medicine.

46:48.358 --> 46:49.899
And agriculture would do this.

46:49.919 --> 46:52.061
Agriculture, we don't collect that comprehensively.

46:52.081 --> 46:57.467
I mean, we don't collect that comprehensively, clinical medicine affecting the agriculture to begin with.

46:58.287 --> 47:02.091
So there are sometimes additional copies of something like high school yearbooks,

47:02.628 --> 47:04.290
textbooks all in a certain date.

47:04.350 --> 47:15.566
There were certain things that we would not retain, you know, and as part of the inventory, we actually did some weeding, you know, according to those criteria.

47:15.886 --> 47:22.034
Now, in all those cases, we, you know, this is a staff of technicians doing this, according to very specific guidelines.

47:22.054 --> 47:23.256
So nothing ever went out.

47:23.376 --> 47:32.128
We kind of gathered them, and we had the specialist to recommend an officer review them, because if they said, gee, this is a really important work, and even though

47:32.362 --> 47:34.145
We really want to keep more copies.

47:34.165 --> 47:38.351
Did you keep a record of the books that you were able to get rid of?

47:38.371 --> 47:41.797
Not, well... I just got back from San Francisco.

47:41.857 --> 47:56.439
The answer is yes in the fact that the shelf list, which is that card file, which is still in existence, is the only way that we would mark, for example, next to copy three, discard.

47:56.579 --> 47:59.043
So what you're telling me is you kept a record.

47:59.063 --> 48:00.225
Oh, yeah, it's in the shelf list.

48:00.357 --> 48:01.859
San Francisco didn't keep a record.

48:01.879 --> 48:02.059
Oh, no.

48:02.079 --> 48:03.922
200,000 books went to the landfill.

48:04.002 --> 48:05.103
Nobody can tell you what they are.

48:05.123 --> 48:05.444
No, I know.

48:05.484 --> 48:10.971
That's... No, this is... Because we have the inventory... The shelf list is the inventory record.

48:11.612 --> 48:15.878
And so we... They mark the shelf list for that copy.

48:16.138 --> 48:17.701
We have shelf list.

48:17.941 --> 48:19.603
Steve, before I forget, what's your phone number?

48:19.623 --> 48:23.809
202-707-1410.

48:24.650 --> 48:26.232
I have to sign books in an hour.

48:26.252 --> 48:26.533
Okay.

48:26.553 --> 48:29.757
I have to go to my hotel and check out... Okay.

48:30.007 --> 48:32.752
These are other, for example, this book is in rare book.

48:32.992 --> 48:34.475
Once again, shelf markers.

48:35.196 --> 48:38.021
Years ago, somebody asked for this book, the N85.

48:38.722 --> 48:39.423
It's not on the shelf.

48:39.443 --> 48:40.846
They were going to not on shelf before.

48:40.866 --> 48:41.647
And that would be it.

48:42.048 --> 48:42.889
That's all they get.

48:42.910 --> 48:46.235
And now they come up to that and say, where it is, we'll do a special search.

48:46.716 --> 48:47.938
But this book is a rare book.

48:47.958 --> 48:48.820
It's not even missing.

48:48.860 --> 48:52.386
I mean, it's one floor away, and it's accessible to the person.

48:52.636 --> 48:55.720
So now if somebody asks for the book, we say, that is in the rare book collection.

48:55.740 --> 49:00.686
What do you call the people that come in here and do that check, the shelvers or the pages?

49:00.706 --> 49:02.388
These were collections improvement systems.

49:02.408 --> 49:08.696
The people that actually, oh, the people that page or the people that... No, the person that comes down and can't find that book.

49:11.920 --> 49:19.369
But this is really important because we have a lot of stuff on microfilm, and we have a lot of things in the rare book or in the reference collection.

49:19.568 --> 49:22.192
And, you know, people have just gotten it on the shelf before.

49:22.212 --> 49:23.914
Now they actually can get right to the book.

49:23.934 --> 49:24.615
We tell them where it is.

49:24.635 --> 49:29.461
And the item-by-item inventory that you've done, is that all in computer now?

49:29.501 --> 49:30.743
Because it started in the 70s.

49:31.244 --> 49:32.585
Do you have a database now for that?

49:32.605 --> 49:33.166
There is not a database.

49:33.186 --> 49:33.927
Any kind of retrospective stuff?

49:33.947 --> 49:34.648
There is not a database.

49:34.688 --> 49:36.050
It's all in manual form.

49:36.070 --> 49:36.631
And it should be.

49:36.711 --> 49:41.798
And when we get the integrated library system, one of the promises, we can enter all this into the database.

49:42.158 --> 49:45.362
So it's all online, so I know something's missing in inventory.

49:45.563 --> 49:46.504
That's long-range.

49:46.940 --> 49:55.415
Yeah, the system is probably shorter range, but the system is going to do a lot of things, and before you input 12 million cards and all of this, it's going to be quite a while.

49:55.436 --> 49:56.417
So we can start walking.

49:56.558 --> 49:57.299
Okay.

49:57.359 --> 49:59.122
How are you?

49:59.383 --> 50:02.048
And how long have you been here?

50:03.069 --> 50:04.392
In this job, 20 years.

50:04.712 --> 50:07.237
And your background, just briefly, you said you're a librarian.

50:07.297 --> 50:07.978
Librarian.

50:07.998 --> 50:08.880
I was a public...

50:09.383 --> 50:11.166
We worked for a small public library.

50:11.566 --> 50:11.927
Where?

50:12.407 --> 50:13.689
In New Jersey.

50:13.729 --> 50:18.516
So you don't sound like you came from Kentucky.

50:18.676 --> 50:19.898
I came from New Orleans.

50:20.539 --> 50:23.163
I was working with a blind handicapped in New Jersey.

50:23.223 --> 50:29.752
That sounds like an interesting... We were in the library for the blind handicapped in New Jersey.

50:30.533 --> 50:38.665
Is that a major... Well, part of the Library of Congress is called the National Library of Science for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.

50:38.881 --> 50:42.304
And they have a network of, they work in regional libraries around the country.

50:43.145 --> 50:44.286
And New Jersey was one of them.

50:44.366 --> 50:47.789
Actually, that's why I came down here, because I was working in New Jersey, and then I got a job ahead.

50:47.809 --> 50:48.850
Now, these numbers, 18?

50:48.950 --> 50:50.572
They're probably going down.

50:51.753 --> 50:53.014
So how many?

50:53.074 --> 50:55.937
Well, on one level, it's about eight.

50:56.377 --> 50:59.820
On the other, it's two, four, six.

50:59.841 --> 51:00.441
Many levels.

51:00.461 --> 51:01.402
There are more.

51:01.522 --> 51:03.064
It's about 10 or 12 decks.

51:03.404 --> 51:03.784
Decks.

51:04.044 --> 51:05.065
Decks is a key word.

51:05.666 --> 51:05.766
Yeah.

51:06.539 --> 51:10.766
Where do you have to go from here?

51:10.786 --> 51:16.074
This lift just goes up to the main reading room, which is right above us.

51:16.094 --> 51:20.000
So these conveyors deliver books from all three buildings.

51:20.081 --> 51:27.873
Here, if the reader wants it upstairs, they're put on this lift and they're picked up and delivered to the reader upstairs.

51:27.893 --> 51:30.437
How old is this system?

51:31.042 --> 51:32.764
Not quite a hundred years.

51:32.784 --> 51:34.226
Really?

51:34.287 --> 51:36.590
Not the mechanized system.

51:36.610 --> 51:39.474
No, but it just goes around.

51:40.035 --> 51:44.241
And we have an old tube system, a message tube system.

51:44.261 --> 51:45.482
Pneumatic tube.

51:45.502 --> 51:48.547
So did you go to library school or something like that?

51:48.827 --> 51:49.167
Ah, Rutgers.

51:49.268 --> 51:49.949
Library school.

51:50.189 --> 51:50.549
Yep.

51:50.569 --> 51:51.330
Do they still have it?

51:52.031 --> 51:52.292
Oh, yeah.

51:52.312 --> 51:54.835
You know, Columbia's is gone, Chicago's gone.

51:54.855 --> 51:55.737
No, it's still there.

51:55.937 --> 52:00.383
It's more, it used to be a Rutgers school library.

52:00.483 --> 52:00.964
Now it's

52:01.467 --> 52:07.894
The communications, the school communications is kind of merged, folded into it.

52:07.914 --> 52:11.017
Now, do you work in the collections management division?

52:11.077 --> 52:11.938
Is that what you're?

52:11.958 --> 52:12.178
Yes.

52:12.278 --> 52:14.020
I just noticed on the side over there.

52:14.040 --> 52:19.666
Yeah, this is kind of part of my division.

52:19.746 --> 52:22.910
It's a large division of about 250 people.

52:23.450 --> 52:25.973
And that's probably down from what it once was.

52:26.375 --> 52:27.396
In some areas.

52:27.416 --> 52:32.583
Yeah, mostly behind the scenes.

52:32.603 --> 52:38.231
Are we still in Jefferson?

52:38.251 --> 52:38.812
Yeah.

52:38.832 --> 52:42.777
I mean, they come here for these books and the multimedia.

52:42.877 --> 52:48.204
But, you know, the books are always in different languages, and this is a key part of research.

52:48.225 --> 52:50.087
You said they're here and they're out of any place else.

52:50.320 --> 52:54.668
A lot of our books, people come here because these things are not anywhere else.

52:55.169 --> 52:59.898
We're a national library, and a lot of our collections you don't find anywhere else.

52:59.958 --> 53:05.669
So therefore, the responsibility that you have is as a depository library.

53:05.769 --> 53:09.175
And not only to people now, but to future generations.

53:09.195 --> 53:11.620
There is no other place to find this material.

53:11.819 --> 53:12.682
In many cases.

53:12.762 --> 53:17.516
So when you look at it and decide if it's going off-site, I don't know which way you're going.

53:17.877 --> 53:18.920
I'm down here.

53:18.940 --> 53:19.161
Okay.

53:19.221 --> 53:19.843
Thanks a lot.

53:19.883 --> 53:20.525
I'll be in touch.

53:20.545 --> 53:21.147
Yeah, let me know.

53:21.187 --> 53:22.571
Excellent.

53:23.494 --> 53:24.276
Thanks a lot.
