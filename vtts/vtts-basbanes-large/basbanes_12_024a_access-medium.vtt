WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:15.072
I remember thinking at the time, wouldn't it be in the way that way, so it wasn't a great thing for the world.

00:15.092 --> 00:18.439
It was almost like I didn't notice anyone who did not know.

00:18.459 --> 00:21.144
I too discovered that my idea was not a novel.

00:21.164 --> 00:24.891
And in my friends who called us a novel, it was something long ago.

00:25.208 --> 00:42.648
But unless I'm wrong, and I, very well believe it, know that you had an athlete until about six months ago.

00:42.668 --> 00:49.116
I'm not that clear in the exact details, but I was a member of the living that we had found such close to have missed over my career.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.739
Her response was not learned exactly, but as we mentioned, she had been discussing the very opposite of the character at the home.

00:52.377 --> 01:17.525
Carmody Alcino, a productive book dealer, and a mutual friend of hers, told Karen and I had that we provide financial support to help get the organization off the ground.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.526
That, I think, was a spark that started fire.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.810
We agreed early on that the Board of Education was not able to see this part of the church, and that it was a hurry to bring in the plumbering of the institutions.

01:22.246 --> 01:41.459
We also agreed that the new management did not be used to see the impact of our railroad work, that we should invite the children to the collectors to join the same table.

01:41.479 --> 01:44.845
My discussions with Karen and her discussion led to a meeting on Tuesday, the 26th of February, about an improvement in the Railroad Department of Boston Public Health.

01:45.112 --> 02:07.295
Ten teams of the first group have been named in the society.

02:07.315 --> 02:14.022
You'll hear, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group, the first group,

02:14.002 --> 02:34.490
From 2009, he called it, and Tom Harkin, who got lost to the values of the BDL and showing how he's the first three years ago.

02:34.510 --> 02:35.311
I don't know if he had a result of that.

02:35.331 --> 02:36.753
I mentioned he was a butterfly.

02:36.773 --> 02:40.218
I sensed that he could be up to around the field of Bobby and Dr. Walker, but we were able to get to all the company.

02:40.238 --> 02:42.000
I don't know about the others, but I was watching when they had my life back in my life.

02:42.436 --> 02:56.576
On the new call 13th meeting, covered in the Caldwell Library on March 12th, the organization has been made of the club first meeting.

02:56.596 --> 03:01.002
We all feel welcome to our newest, and our most illustrious, in Berkeley, our first-selling author, John Cain, who by the way, agreed to be honored to be seated.

03:01.825 --> 03:23.732
The Society was named to honor the work here in 1791, 1797, and commonly lost a collector, scholar, and wilder reporter, and his daughter, and I know you took your pay to the court in three and two, and gave me a lot.

03:23.752 --> 03:26.415
Who was really a member of the vast library of Massachusetts Life in Michigan, 1789, and their country's largest state of blackberry.

03:26.733 --> 03:35.637
This explains the name of the organization.

03:36.218 --> 03:38.785
But it wasn't the purpose.

03:39.254 --> 03:59.236
The purpose is not for some big, for some people.

03:59.256 --> 04:02.941
Though, for the competition, we of course hope that people will open up the membership.

04:02.961 --> 04:04.182
But the part of the fear we need to take the society to stay.

04:04.347 --> 04:10.012
We believe that this isn't a big enough to build a foundation for our lives.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.438
In fact, we should invite our listeners to see if you need to join us.

04:11.722 --> 04:31.973
So, Wayne P.O.D.

04:31.993 --> 04:32.654
is a non-art documentary society.

04:32.674 --> 04:35.718
Our purpose is to provide many of the book collectors, of P.O.D., of learners, artists, printers, publishers, writers, and lovers of books that we need.

04:35.738 --> 04:37.381
Meet, share, and socialize, and listen to it with papers, and to spread the truth.

04:37.401 --> 04:38.843
In short, our purpose is to promote supporting the books in our country.

04:40.780 --> 04:53.712
We are delighted to join in for the paper society's first meeting, and the whole meeting of life, and the whole meeting of the nation.

04:53.732 --> 04:56.038
So I think that I have a way of understanding how the universe can be, and what is part of the process of the body.

05:05.553 --> 05:18.217
I happened in one of those early meetings, happened to have rarely said, oh, it's no problem for me to open a bank account.

05:18.237 --> 05:22.284
And so I got chosen to be the person to handle the finances.

05:23.466 --> 05:24.388
And thus far,

05:24.368 --> 05:38.412
There are 40 paid-up members, and despite having $10,000 for mailings, we have $1,017.45 to the bank.

05:38.611 --> 05:45.362
And if you do some calculations, you may wonder how we got that much with 40 members.

05:46.203 --> 05:50.711
And it's not that I have some magic way of making money from class.

05:51.452 --> 06:00.687
It's that there have been a few people who have contributed very much more of that community.

06:00.667 --> 06:07.139
that $20 membership dues.

06:07.720 --> 06:18.060
Those of you who have not paid dues and who may wish to do so will be given an opportunity after the last year.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.128
Peter is going to tell you about the next meeting of this site.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.350
Hear about your next meeting before this, have your friends.

06:23.330 --> 06:39.996
The next meeting, the Orphan Dational Meeting of the Tricker Society, will take place on Wednesday, June 26th at Mass Street Historical Society.

06:40.016 --> 06:42.119
The Historical Society is located at 1154 Boyleston Street.

06:42.139 --> 06:47.768
The meeting will be at the same time, but we will have a reception first, and every time we want a chance to assemble, there's a Red Sox team that evening.

06:47.748 --> 06:57.927
And also, we hope by applying to some degree that we can make a business part of the program as painless as possible.

06:58.347 --> 07:04.939
While there is some real business to be done in getting this organization going, we thought we needed to entice you with more than something to drink.

07:04.959 --> 07:10.870
So that means we'll have to reach from our three persons who are knowledgeable about the tips that they're looking at.

07:11.153 --> 07:25.045
Sally Swager, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education.

07:25.065 --> 07:28.713
She received on Hannah Elliott-Hickner, and she provided and encouraged studies at home, which she founded in 1873, New York, and 9-year-old.

07:28.733 --> 07:29.455
Peter Arcaro from the Hope Library.

07:29.475 --> 07:30.377
She received on George Hickner from Brooklyn.

07:30.357 --> 07:47.877
And Ken Carpenter, a former member of the sort of, a founder of the sort of fiction, until recently one of the key ornaments of the Harbinger, who's deepened the role of the Tickner's in the founding of the public library, and the free public library commission of that.

07:48.363 --> 08:02.575
In order to make it all Tickner's all the time, for that reason I plan to show you some of the exorbitant sides of the current firmness between young George Tickner and Thomas Jefferson.

08:05.609 --> 08:27.355
I only have to do one thing to get off.

08:27.375 --> 08:28.316
I hope that you need to know what you're doing.

08:28.336 --> 08:28.556
Hi, I'm Ms.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.398
Sylvia Bellis, and I've been asked if you lose my time at the invitation to be the speaker.

08:30.418 --> 08:34.283
Nick, as probably most of you know, is the author of The Densighting Book on a Global Connection, a general manager, which is now in the state of the country called the WTI of the Constitution.

08:34.263 --> 08:54.206
He has a book out of now, page 42, over 32,000 copies of these.

08:54.226 --> 08:55.327
If you haven't read either one, I recommend him highly.

08:55.347 --> 08:56.509
He's spoken to book collection books all over the country.

08:56.529 --> 08:56.929
He collects stories.

08:56.909 --> 09:14.271
from these groups of people in the world and including them in the book about the whole calendars and the calendars of culture.

09:14.291 --> 09:17.095
He has a new book coming out, Among the Judges Mads, which will be published in November, and it will probably feature more than one person.

09:17.395 --> 09:31.422
The next is to work on all of our time and this is to take this aside and actually do the first and the first one, just the third one and the second one and the second one and the second one.

09:45.070 --> 09:45.771
Thank you very much.

09:45.831 --> 09:52.979
We don't have a microphone, but if you want me to speak up, please just yell out.

09:52.999 --> 09:55.422
I would be more than happy to do my level best.

09:56.303 --> 09:59.206
I want to thank David and Tom and Ken and Peter.

09:59.226 --> 10:02.030
Boy, that sounds like a double play combination, doesn't it?

10:02.070 --> 10:03.411
From David to Tom to Ken.

10:03.852 --> 10:09.018
And of course, Priscilla as well for this wonderful and brief thank you very much.

10:09.078 --> 10:10.960
I specifically reflected a brief introduction.

10:11.311 --> 10:11.972
Thank you very much.

10:12.032 --> 10:14.214
You did call me the chronicler of the book world.

10:14.254 --> 10:15.155
I like that a lot.

10:15.175 --> 10:16.677
Ruth Conti, my wife, was with me.

10:17.618 --> 10:26.267
And I were down in Chattanooga, Tennessee about two weeks ago giving a talk down there, and there was a big piece in the local paper that proclaimed the arrival of the king of the bibliophile.

10:30.492 --> 10:33.535
And Conti said he's impossible enough to live with as it is.

10:33.575 --> 10:36.458
Now he's going to be totally inseparable.

10:36.758 --> 10:40.242
In Chattanooga, I was the king of the bibliophile.

10:40.342 --> 10:44.688
In Charleston, South Carolina, I was introduced as the energizer bunny of the book world.

10:45.969 --> 10:46.850
That was kind of fun.

10:46.911 --> 10:53.919
Morgantown, no, Huntington, West Virginia, three weeks ago, was the Johnny Appleseed of the book world.

10:54.079 --> 11:02.270
And that's kind of fun, because Johnny Appleseed is from my neck of the woods, and he really did sow the seeds, of course, of apple culture, I guess.

11:02.290 --> 11:06.715
And if I could go out and speak my gospel of book culture,

11:06.948 --> 11:09.430
That's a wonderful designation.

11:09.450 --> 11:24.545
I won't dwell too long on the designation of me by Larry McMurtry of the New York Review of Books as the Rickshaw Cooley of the book world, trotting my leaders from this library to this collector to this wherever.

11:24.565 --> 11:27.869
If anyone knows what that was all about, let me know.

11:27.889 --> 11:34.255
I think maybe I should have trotted my rickshaw down at Archer City, Texas, but anyway, I didn't get there.

11:34.522 --> 11:44.536
What a great, great honor it is for me to really be here among kindred spirits to give this inaugural presentation of the Tickness Society.

11:45.437 --> 11:51.265
We are gathered in this library in the spirit of fellowship and a common denominator for all of us in books.

11:52.166 --> 11:59.837
Regardless of our backgrounds, our professions, our institutional affiliations, we are all here this afternoon because we have this shared passion.

12:00.560 --> 12:13.721
The spirit of this organization begins, I think, with what the late Lawrence Clark, Clark Powell, wonderful, that'll throw you off track.

12:15.724 --> 12:27.563
The great librarian at the University of California, Los Angeles, over a three to four year period, he augmented the collections there from 395,000 volumes to 3.9 million volumes.

12:27.982 --> 12:34.932
But he always said that everything he did, he began as a librarian in the Los Angeles Public Library.

12:34.972 --> 12:37.315
He also worked with Jake Zeitlin, the bookseller.

12:37.916 --> 12:38.798
He was a collector.

12:38.818 --> 12:39.779
He was a writer.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.722
All of these marvelous things.

12:41.802 --> 12:46.749
And he said he called this the trinity of book collector, his interest.

12:46.769 --> 12:51.736
He called it the trinity of book collector, of bookseller, and librarian.

12:51.756 --> 12:56.503
To which I would add, of course, the many book people that have been mentioned here

12:57.496 --> 13:03.966
bibliographers, bookmakers of every persuasion, printers, binders, type of files, of course, readers.

13:04.387 --> 13:10.737
I think, of course, the final analysis was what do all book people ultimately work for is to be a reader and to serve readers.

13:12.039 --> 13:19.631
As I said, Larry Powell was quite a book person, and I think that he would certainly be one of the first supporters of a picnic society.

13:20.693 --> 13:23.858
In my view, also, a fellowship of books is also a continuum.

13:24.547 --> 13:36.767
My rallying cry in this respect is a privilege of praise from Shakespeare's Tempest, the very words that are inscribed above the main portal of the National Archives of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., to which what is passed is prologue.

13:37.809 --> 13:48.546
I'm sure that at some point in the future, and I certainly know because we've just been told that in our very next meeting we will be having a number of detailed presentations on the Tickney and George Tickney,

13:48.830 --> 13:56.198
Anna Elliott Tickner, and I won't attempt the year of Anna here, but 1886, I guess, is the year that she passed away.

13:56.238 --> 13:57.299
That's a very important year.

13:57.800 --> 14:10.633
But I do think that I would like to just speak very briefly, just briefly, trust me, I won't pinge on anyone's turf here, just why we, I guess, in our deliberations, why we came up with the name Tickner for this society.

14:11.294 --> 14:16.980
Whether we're having these preliminary talks or a number of worthy suggestions put forth for a name worthy of this organization,

14:17.602 --> 14:23.788
We thought briefly about the 19th century collectors George Livermore, Edward Cromenshield, and Nathaniel Schritlett.

14:23.808 --> 14:28.092
We liked Stephen Day a lot, of course, the first printer whose press was not far from here.

14:28.853 --> 14:32.256
But we settled on George Tickner because it seemed like he touched all the bases.

14:32.857 --> 14:46.090
And there was the added dimension, of course, of his daughter, Anna Elliot Tickner, a pioneer in the effort to educate women, a founder of the society to encourage studies at home, and an early member of the Massachusetts Library Commission, the nation's first touch organization.

14:46.694 --> 14:54.444
This is a quote from David Tyak, who wrote a wonderful book called George Tickner in the Boston-Burman University of Harvard Press, 1967.

14:55.085 --> 15:01.053
He wrote that in the cause of culture, Anna proved to be as public-spirited and well-organized as her father.

15:01.894 --> 15:16.313
She also wrote a book for children anonymously, published periodically, called An American Family in Paris in 1869, in which she wrote nostalgically a wife abroad with a particularly gigantic but all the same delightfully agreeable father.

15:17.221 --> 15:22.627
As for George Pickner, let us note that he was a historian, he was a teacher, he was a collector, he was a benefactor.

15:23.048 --> 15:26.131
His books became a major collection at the Boston Public Library.

15:26.792 --> 15:31.177
And above all else, he was a person who believed in the primacy of books in a civilized society.

15:32.139 --> 15:47.076
During the 15 years he spent at Harvard, 1820 to 1835, he was an outspoken advocate of change, proposals, I might add, that pretty much fell on deaf ears while he was here, but which were largely implemented afterwards by a nephew who became president of Harvard University.

15:48.220 --> 15:56.791
Not only do we have a scholar of the first rank, we have a pioneer in the public library movement who chose full support behind the formation of the Boston Public Library.

15:57.331 --> 16:05.882
He served on a committee that investigated its feasibility and is credited with writing most of what is now regarded as the seminal document in the public library movement.

16:05.902 --> 16:15.814
It's peddled upon the objects to be attained by the establishment of the public library published in 1852, just two years after his monumental history of Spanish literature.

16:16.267 --> 16:21.472
I'll just read one little blurb from that, and then we'll go along with the Fellowship of Books.

16:22.192 --> 16:29.879
He had always been for a library that would involve the people, I think he was right there, the public.

16:29.899 --> 16:43.512
25 years earlier, he had made proposals to open up the Boston Athenaeum to try and amalgamate a number of the libraries in Boston, in the Boston area, but always at the forefront where the books would circulate and that they would acquire books.

16:43.572 --> 16:45.193
This sounds like such a...

16:45.511 --> 16:49.315
an obvious thing to be propounding today, but not so much then.

16:49.395 --> 17:03.229
And when, in fact, I believe in 1849, 1840, in the early 1840s, John Jacob Astor gave $400,000 to establish a library, a purportedly public library in New York City.

17:04.190 --> 17:09.014
But what was left out of the equation was that books could circulate.

17:09.034 --> 17:12.598
Kittner always wanted to have books that could circulate

17:12.983 --> 17:14.665
and to buy books and think of it.

17:14.765 --> 17:20.231
But there was one category of books that he said that we absolutely have to buy for this new Boston Public Library.

17:20.871 --> 17:30.422
He described them as books that few persons will wish to read, and of which, therefore, only one copy will be kept, for which should be permitted to circulate freely.

17:30.442 --> 17:38.450
And if this copy should, contrary to expectations, be so often asked for as to be rarely on its shelves, another copy should then be bought.

17:38.470 --> 17:41.033
But this whole idea of buying books that no one wants to read,

17:41.350 --> 17:45.497
Another really pioneering concept.

17:45.657 --> 18:03.686
When Ken Carter was showing me, when we were working on Patience and Fortitude, and Ken very wonderfully took me around on the rounds to widen the library, how he selected books to go off to off-site storage at the Harvard Depository.

18:03.706 --> 18:07.071
We're in a Harvard building now, so I will get appreciative now.

18:07.574 --> 18:11.663
When I give talks around the country, I say, are there any Harvard graduates here in the room?

18:11.683 --> 18:13.166
You'll get one or two hands.

18:13.547 --> 18:17.775
And I will say, did you know that you had a campus in South Florida, Massachusetts?

18:17.795 --> 18:21.904
They never know that there's a Harvard campus 20 or 30 miles from here.

18:22.424 --> 18:29.410
And on those grounds, of course, I have the Harvard Depository on the one side, and the Monkies for the medical school on the other.

18:29.430 --> 18:37.196
And I won't get into the sense of man and the absence of man here, but there are facilities there we hope for the future to store 20 million books.

18:37.217 --> 18:46.825
But the point is how you select books that need general circulation, especially when they go into a facility that faculty and students aren't allowed to go into.

18:46.845 --> 18:49.127
So how are you going to find the books that you need?

18:49.147 --> 18:52.009
Well, these are all very, very important considerations.

18:52.343 --> 19:00.597
And Ken was telling me that when he was buying books for the Kress Library, there were times that he would buy books that had not been read in 200 years.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.962
He said, I know this because they were uncut.

19:03.102 --> 19:08.531
It didn't matter to me if it hadn't been read for 200 years and if it wasn't read for another 200 years.

19:08.551 --> 19:11.877
The important thing is that Harvard has to have that book.

19:11.897 --> 19:17.507
Well, here we are taking in these concepts 150 or 60 years ago by George Ticker.

19:18.145 --> 19:31.204
Well, I will leave the discussion in particular for the next meeting, but I would like to just have one little point to make on the real bonus of selecting him as the namesake for our group, and that's his book place.

19:31.464 --> 19:39.075
You know, when you've got your little invitation, and I was going through the group here trying to get the correct pronunciation for the Latin.

19:39.175 --> 19:44.603
I'm going to tell you, everybody, we have to brush up on our Latin skills here, but I do believe it's Suu Kui Kui.

19:44.944 --> 19:45.925
Kui Kui, is that right?

19:46.327 --> 19:51.895
S-U-U-M-Q-U-E, C-U-I-Q-U-E, for which has several translations.

19:51.975 --> 19:52.897
Thank God for Google.

19:54.058 --> 19:55.901
Let each have his own or to eat his own.

19:55.921 --> 19:56.562
To eat his own.

19:56.582 --> 20:05.796
You can think, again, about the philosophy of George Pickler and wanting to really create an institution which everyone was welcome to.

20:05.816 --> 20:08.800
What a wonderful, wonderful motto that is for an organization.

20:09.822 --> 20:12.165
I went through two volumes.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.844
of Chickmer's letters and journals published in 1876.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.829
I think it approaches 2,000 pages.

20:20.229 --> 20:35.455
I won't suggest that I read anywhere near all of these letters, as I could not find in there anywhere why he selected that particular phrase for his motto for his book play, but I think it's pretty accurate.

20:35.475 --> 20:37.579
I thought when I saw that particular phrase,

20:37.930 --> 20:45.242
of a word that I learned when I went up to Mount Athos in 1998, while I was researching my book, Patience and Fortitude.

20:45.262 --> 20:53.795
Mount Athos, of course, we went active and public in Northern Greece, and I wanted to really see a tradition of preservation of manuscripts over a thousand years.

20:54.436 --> 20:56.199
So obviously, you go to Mount Athos.

20:56.640 --> 21:03.010
But there was a wonderful word that I read across called ideorhythmic, and it described a form of...

21:03.327 --> 21:05.670
monasticism no longer in favor of the person.

21:05.791 --> 21:06.872
I'm a Greek-American.

21:07.153 --> 21:13.121
You can understand why the Greeks are like a form of monasticism where people can kind of follow their own way.

21:14.003 --> 21:17.688
The word loosely translated means living by one's own life patterns.

21:18.489 --> 21:23.557
It's nicely consistent, I think, with the principles maintained by Mr. Tickner and by this society.

21:24.458 --> 21:28.284
Well, by way of background, and of course, as I said, what is past is prologue.

21:29.005 --> 21:31.208
My immersion is an author of books about books,

21:31.947 --> 21:48.291
A book delving into the affairs of this community and my community under Cambridge and Boston and New England began right here in 1988 with an attempt to describe what I then rather glibly called 1,200 years of book collecting in Greater Boston.

21:48.311 --> 21:49.973
1,200 years.

21:50.013 --> 21:50.754
How do you get that?

21:50.794 --> 21:53.238
350 years at Harvard, I guess you could start.

21:53.598 --> 21:57.023
200 years at the Massachusetts Historical Society.

21:57.164 --> 21:58.866
175 or so at the Boston Athenaeum.

21:59.386 --> 22:10.481
another 175 or so at the AAS, out of my neck of the woods in Worcester, 150 at the BPL, and a few other places, and we'd come up with 1,200 years.

22:10.601 --> 22:11.682
That's kind of fun.

22:12.684 --> 22:15.988
Why in the world would I want to do something like this?

22:16.629 --> 22:18.872
Well, in 1988, it began in Philadelphia.

22:18.892 --> 22:21.195
We have a lot of Philadelphia connections here.

22:21.956 --> 22:24.820
It was a wonderful exhibition, and it gave us a gift.

22:25.137 --> 22:39.597
Library Company of Philadelphia, in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Historical Society, curated by the late Edwin Wolfe, some of you might remember Eddie Wolfe of Marvelous Fed, who, with John Flanning, was the author of the great Rosenbach biography.

22:39.617 --> 22:42.141
He was the librarian at the Library Company.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.362
Just a marvelous bookman.

22:44.083 --> 22:48.770
And Eddie curated this exhibition called Legacies of Genius.

22:48.790 --> 22:54.638
And what it was, essentially, was a gathering, a selection of the literary masterpieces,

22:54.905 --> 23:02.892
I guess I hesitate to use the word high spot because that word really doesn't suggest it to some of the wonderful treasures that were brought together.

23:02.912 --> 23:16.004
But the concept of pulling together all of these many, many wonderful objects from the libraries and museums in the area into one exhibition, that was a smashing show.

23:16.024 --> 23:20.288
And I remember saying to Eddie Wolf, gee, do you think we could do something like this up in Boston?

23:21.169 --> 23:24.912
And of course he winked and he said, well, it's hard to do it all by themselves if I wanted to.

23:25.212 --> 23:32.401
You wouldn't have to do it, but it gave me the idea to write a magazine piece, which I proposed to Bostonian Magazine.

23:32.421 --> 23:33.262
I forget the title.

23:33.383 --> 23:39.531
I mean, my idea was 1,200 years of collecting a Boston piece.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.054
And they brought the piece.

23:42.074 --> 23:48.362
And I do remember reading, as I always do to my wife, which is when I'm writing, working on things that I really care about.

23:48.783 --> 23:49.463
I read aloud.

23:49.544 --> 23:51.426
She's a write-up critic.

23:51.446 --> 23:53.008
I remember starting right here, at least

23:53.309 --> 24:08.030
and the Houghton Library, or the room where the Keats, the Keats Room is, looking at the life mass of John Keats, and then kind of moving my readers across the Charles Sylvester's Historical Society, and up to the Boston Athenaeum, getting some idea.

24:08.050 --> 24:09.713
And I'm reading it alive in 2015.

24:09.733 --> 24:11.515
Yeah, don't waste this story.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.418
I'll never write a book about it.

24:13.438 --> 24:16.162
I have to say, she says, this is the book you were going to write.

24:18.466 --> 24:20.869
Well, I did write the magazine piece, and I submitted it.

24:21.305 --> 24:34.422
And did you know they took out that lead, which is just as well with me, because I did finally use it in what became the idea to write this book that I chose, I think, in a moment of pure inspiration to call A Gentle Madman.

24:35.984 --> 24:37.707
That was a book that always had a title.

24:38.287 --> 24:44.235
Of course, as you mentioned that I worked in Worcester for 50 years.

24:44.255 --> 24:46.338
I told you to keep it short.

24:46.358 --> 24:50.063
I was a book editor out in the Worcester area for a number of years, and

24:50.853 --> 25:08.816
one of our great, great libraries out there, the American Agiquarian Society, founded in 1812 by the great patriots, bookseller, printer, everything to do with books of the late, of the revolution of the early federal period, Isaiah Thomas.

25:08.836 --> 25:18.008
He did all these marvelous things, but what we really remember him for today is this library that was formed with his book collection, and which in fact he came

25:18.342 --> 25:38.606
what I contend is a uniquely, certainly if not unique, but by all means distinctively American institution, which is the research library that has really no connection whatsoever with an educational institution, but which was founded and established and nurtured by a book collector, the American Aquarian Society of the First.

25:38.726 --> 25:45.734
Now there's the Pierpont Morgan Library, of course, the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, the Huntington Library in San Marino, the J.C.

25:45.814 --> 25:46.695
Brown Library,

25:47.131 --> 25:54.341
from the University of Clemens Library at Ann Arbor University of Michigan, on the campus of the University of Michigan.

25:54.882 --> 26:03.114
In every case, it's a book collector that began and whose eccentricity is at the core of creating this great library.

26:03.134 --> 26:10.064
We also have one in Philadelphia, by the way, the Rosenbach Library, which is not only put together by a collector, but also a bookseller.

26:10.184 --> 26:11.586
I would have to say that's unique.

26:11.853 --> 26:15.799
Is there any other library or museum that was established by a bookseller?

26:15.819 --> 26:22.889
I'd be curious to know if anyone has any nominations to know.

26:22.909 --> 26:25.493
Absolutely, but that's within the last couple of years.

26:25.513 --> 26:25.954
Excellent.

26:26.474 --> 26:27.816
Well, there you go, another bookseller.

26:30.580 --> 26:35.768
When Isaiah Thomas died in 1831, he was in his late 80s,

26:36.237 --> 26:45.205
His grandson, Benjamin Franklin Thomas, said in great tribute, his grandfather was afflicted at the earliest of ages with the gentlest of infirmities.

26:45.766 --> 26:46.967
He was a bibliomaniac.

26:47.908 --> 26:55.735
And I remember being totally charmed by that particular description of him and saying, there's the title for my book, This Gentle Madness.

26:55.755 --> 27:00.459
And the underlying premise of the whole thing was not just, again, it started with institutions.

27:00.479 --> 27:03.342
How did we make the leap from institutions to book collectors?

27:03.845 --> 27:06.428
Well, of course, as Priscilla mentioned, I like stories.

27:06.448 --> 27:08.110
I like to do things through narrative.

27:08.931 --> 27:14.358
At every turn, I mean, where you go to the Massachusetts historical society, you run into Jeremy Belmer.

27:14.378 --> 27:17.863
You want to look at the Boston Public Library and the forebear there.

27:17.883 --> 27:20.606
There was the great Prince Library that came over there.

27:20.626 --> 27:22.568
Well, Prince is another.

27:22.588 --> 27:25.512
Thomas Prince is a fabulous character.

27:25.532 --> 27:27.034
Well, Isaiah Thomas, as I already mentioned.

27:27.588 --> 27:39.865
stories to be told, Jeremy Delnap, literally grabbing Paul Le Gere by the hotel and saying, sit down, putting a pen in his hand, say, tell us about that midnight ride, you know, write it down, you want to have it.

27:39.925 --> 27:54.625
Every time I looked, there were these wonderful, wonderful stories and that realization that I could probably do something very, very interesting, using as the underlying premise that so much of what we know, so much of what we treasure, so much of what we respect and hold here of our

27:54.942 --> 28:00.871
Literature, our history, our culture, we do owe in very great measure to book collectors.

28:00.891 --> 28:02.633
Sounds like an excellent premise, I suppose.

28:03.334 --> 28:08.301
But I was able to go out and find many, many instances where this happened to be the case.

28:08.381 --> 28:23.363
I mean, I don't know how many of you have gone to the old British Library, of course, the new British Library, where you see that one display case at the center of the room where of nine items in there, five of them have the designation Cotton, Robert Cotton.

28:23.630 --> 28:50.768
the day old manuscript which we would not have the great english ethic if it's not for a book collector robert cotton we wouldn't have sir gawaine and the green knight we wouldn't have pierre's diplomat we wouldn't have the linda sparring gospel if it's not for this book collector robert right here in boston i love this when i go and go to southern universities but i've been to tennessee and virginia you know the heart of the old confederacy and to tell these people that the the great confederate imprint collection by which all others are measured

28:51.001 --> 28:56.827
The standard is right here in Boston, a couple of doors up from the Union Club on Creek and Hill in the Boston Athenaeum.

28:57.608 --> 29:00.671
And, you know, they smirk and they smile and they say, that's not possible.

29:00.731 --> 29:02.072
But then you look at it and guess what?

29:02.092 --> 29:02.973
It's true.

29:02.993 --> 29:03.974
Why is that true?

29:04.014 --> 29:09.900
Well, Francis Parkman, as the Civil War is coming to a close, says, we have to do something.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.941
We have to get some money.

29:10.961 --> 29:14.445
We have to pass that old Boston hat, as he said, to grow.

29:14.585 --> 29:17.127
And he gets $500 from the members of the Athenaeum.

29:17.147 --> 29:17.928
That was a start.

29:18.248 --> 29:19.810
He kicked in some money on his own.

29:20.498 --> 29:28.728
He goes down south, or he sends his agents down into the Confederacy and gathers up, I believe it's something in the area of 5,000 imprints.

29:28.748 --> 29:32.332
Now, I can't name you a single one of these imprints, and that's the beauty of an imprint.

29:32.352 --> 29:35.336
We talk about ephemeral objects.

29:35.416 --> 29:39.561
The extraordinary nature of this collection is the collection itself.

29:39.601 --> 29:40.982
I mean, it's not one object.

29:41.022 --> 29:46.489
I think if you were to take one out or add one in, it's not going to improve it.

29:46.604 --> 29:48.126
damage it one way or the other.

29:48.187 --> 29:53.635
What it is, it's a great collection that exists as a synergistic hole.

29:54.296 --> 29:59.665
Well, there was another example of the book collector who was going out to preserve the culture.

29:59.685 --> 30:01.067
It seemed like a pretty good premise.

30:01.107 --> 30:12.705
I wrote up a proposal, sent it off, found an agent who sold it, lo and behold, in a very short period of time, a few weeks, and I was off to the races.

30:12.825 --> 30:13.827
I was supposed to

30:14.414 --> 30:16.337
Submit a manuscript in 18 months.

30:16.477 --> 30:20.684
This was back in 1989, I guess it was.

30:20.725 --> 30:22.367
Six years later, the book came out.

30:23.068 --> 30:24.972
It was supposed to be 90,000 words.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.656
The publisher was 250,000.

30:27.836 --> 30:31.062
I wonder why I changed publishers along the way.

30:31.082 --> 30:33.406
That's what I'm doing.

30:33.426 --> 30:36.631
But a really very, very strange thing has happened.

30:36.651 --> 30:39.055
I mean, I am, by training and background, a journalist.

30:39.406 --> 30:42.589
I've done many, many interviews.

30:42.869 --> 30:44.711
I've done a lot of investigative reporting.

30:45.712 --> 30:49.856
For 22 years, I wrote a weekly book column of literary commentary.

30:49.876 --> 30:57.263
I would interview a major author here in Boston, always end the interview by asking the author to describe my copy of the book.

30:57.283 --> 31:03.329
So at one point, not only am I this book critic, I'm now becoming this book collector.

31:03.349 --> 31:06.932
Because obviously, if you're going to go interview Arthur Miller on the time days,

31:07.199 --> 31:33.139
you know and that's the only book you have i mean wouldn't it be who you get a death of the salesman you know first edition with a dust jacket right which i did and there actually is a number of popular books which i had in the sky i will tell you one key story i've told you a number of times which is always fun 1984 i believe it is i'm interviewing joseph heller in boston at the ritz-cartney's with the new novel it's called god knows

31:34.030 --> 31:34.591
Lovely.

31:34.731 --> 31:35.272
I enjoyed it.

31:35.292 --> 31:37.154
I mean, it didn't get the greatest reviews in the world.

31:37.174 --> 31:38.556
I thought it was fun.

31:38.576 --> 31:40.198
And this was a really terrific man.

31:40.318 --> 31:41.099
We were having lunch.

31:41.479 --> 31:46.746
And towards the end, I said, would you mind inscribing a couple copies of your books for me, of your books for me?

31:46.806 --> 31:47.967
He said, no, I'd be happy to.

31:47.987 --> 31:49.349
And he goes with the first one, God knows.

31:49.369 --> 31:52.813
And then he said, too bad you don't have a first edition of Catch-22.

31:53.814 --> 31:56.858
And really, too bad you don't have one with a dust jacket.

31:56.878 --> 31:58.921
Of course, that was before I opened up my briefcase.

32:00.262 --> 32:03.126
Went through the Catch-22 in a beautiful dust jacket.

32:03.545 --> 32:05.227
And he was a very savvy guy.

32:05.247 --> 32:07.450
He said, maybe you just want him to sign that.

32:07.470 --> 32:09.813
Or what are you saying in a very gentle way?

32:09.873 --> 32:13.357
Maybe my name in there would deflate the value of the book.

32:13.377 --> 32:15.180
It really mattered perhaps with his signature.

32:15.500 --> 32:22.008
My feeling on this was, you know, the value to me is personal, not monetary.

32:22.028 --> 32:23.510
I would rather have an inscription.

32:23.550 --> 32:27.595
So what Helen then wrote into the book was something like this.

32:27.616 --> 32:30.379
For Nick Basdames, who treasures his first editions,

32:30.815 --> 32:35.080
I only wish I had a first edition copy of this book.

32:39.085 --> 32:44.632
Well, you know, I thought he was kidding, but he was going through what we call a domestic crisis at the time.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.198
The books were not with him, shall we also say.

32:51.199 --> 32:54.223
Jump ahead now, 18 years or so.

32:54.490 --> 32:58.215
Six months or so, I jump ahead to the publication of Gentle Madness in 1995.

32:58.335 --> 33:01.219
I'm interviewed by Brian Lamb on Book Notes.

33:01.239 --> 33:02.280
I tell that story.

33:02.961 --> 33:06.165
Now I jump ahead two years, and I interview Joseph Heller again.

33:07.006 --> 33:07.747
Again, Aaron Bart.

33:08.468 --> 33:10.611
And the first thing he said to me, I saw you on Book Notes.

33:11.252 --> 33:11.853
I said, really?

33:11.873 --> 33:12.654
He said, I love it.

33:12.674 --> 33:13.314
You are terrific.

33:13.334 --> 33:14.957
Well, this was his Coney Island memoir.

33:15.137 --> 33:23.788
I give this book to him to inscribe, and he writes in there, Renick Bansbane's great collection of Joe Heller, and I still don't have a person who...

33:24.697 --> 33:31.565
Now, when a bookseller tells you that a signature is better than an inscription, you tell me.

33:31.585 --> 33:37.973
If I had just asked for that signature back in 1984, I mean, I'd have a nice book.

33:37.993 --> 33:39.956
It would be worth something out there, I guess.

33:40.496 --> 33:41.698
But would I have that story?

33:41.718 --> 33:43.380
I mean, would I have this?

33:43.520 --> 33:44.822
Everything for me is narrative.

33:44.842 --> 33:46.424
Everything is storytelling.

33:46.444 --> 33:48.887
The book collecting is storytelling.

33:48.947 --> 33:53.252
This book that Priscilla mentioned, which is forthcoming this fall, Among the Gently Mads.

33:53.722 --> 34:19.662
one of the points i make is this very point right here i mean would you rather have a signed book or a book that has a nice long inscription in there what would you rather have a letter from somebody or an article for myself i always feel that more is better

34:19.979 --> 34:22.482
Well, what am I suggesting?

34:22.562 --> 34:36.756
At some point into the research for this book that was going to talk about the history of book collectors and how they helped save our culture, it occurred to me, you know, the light flashes off over my head, you know, I do have skills as a journalist.

34:36.776 --> 34:37.657
I can do interviews.

34:37.677 --> 34:40.000
I like to think I can tell good stories.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.663
I'm a very good investigative reporter.

34:42.683 --> 34:48.889
What somebody has not done, to my knowledge, up to this point, and has not been done since then, is to have a

34:49.072 --> 34:56.439
Somebody go out and write about the collectors of the here and now, the great living collectors, not just the great collectors through history.

34:56.459 --> 35:05.807
So to go back to that word that I used earlier, how this fellowship of books is not only a fellowship of book people, but it is a continuum, but it's past this prologue.

35:05.847 --> 35:16.817
So after having written what I thought was a pretty nice, overture section of book collecting, through a very selective look at book collecting, I really got into

35:17.185 --> 35:31.827
what I think was the departure for General Madness, which was to go out and to really box the compass, as it were, not just geographically, although I did do this geographically, but I think in terms of economic ability to collect.

35:31.887 --> 35:40.780
I mean, I maintain every great bookseller will tell you this, that book collection, and I think every book person will agree to this,

35:41.350 --> 35:44.214
Book collecting is an exercise that you can enjoy at any level.

35:44.315 --> 35:47.019
I mean, you can be the richest person in the world, and you can be wealthy.

35:47.319 --> 35:56.774
And if you can afford $6 million, if one collected it up, they made the Berlin Sale in October for the first photo of Shakespeare.

35:56.794 --> 35:58.196
And I'll cut it a little square about that.

35:58.476 --> 36:00.379
If I could have been, you know, great.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.342
She's got the $6 million.

36:02.362 --> 36:05.066
If I could afford to pay $3 million.

36:05.086 --> 36:08.151
I was actually asked that question on C-SPAN again.

36:08.553 --> 36:09.134
a report.

36:09.214 --> 36:13.360
We were talking about this sale, the Burlans there, which I write about when patients imported to them.

36:14.581 --> 36:16.104
And then we had the books out there.

36:16.124 --> 36:17.706
We had the Blake Signs of Innocence.

36:17.726 --> 36:18.888
We had the first folio.

36:18.908 --> 36:22.092
We had the two volumes of Johnson's Fictionary.

36:22.112 --> 36:25.016
We had a number of really wonderful, wonderful books.

36:25.036 --> 36:30.364
But the reporter said, pointing to the Shakespeare, why in the world would somebody pay $3 million?

36:31.005 --> 36:35.010
But this was the estimate of one of the things before the sale.

36:35.030 --> 36:38.475
Why in the world would somebody pay $3 million for a text

36:38.843 --> 36:42.506
that anyone can download for free on the internet.

36:42.626 --> 36:44.828
You know, think about that.

36:45.569 --> 36:48.031
Why would somebody pay a million dollars for this little book?

36:48.051 --> 36:53.016
He's talking about the plate, the timing of the book, as if size had anything to do with it.

36:53.056 --> 36:57.220
This is, I think, one of two or three exclusive copies of The Sons of Venice.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.522
It's made by Blake lovingly.

36:59.542 --> 37:07.669
Every Blake, of course, as we know, had totally supervised every aspect of the bookmaking process, not only having written the poetry, but having

37:08.071 --> 37:12.018
as he executed the artwork, making the book stick in your hand cover.

37:12.038 --> 37:12.920
It's just a work of art.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.824
It's an iconic object.

37:14.844 --> 37:23.700
I remember putting my hand on the Shakespeare of the famous ocean engraving facing the title page and saying, well, you know, if you think that

37:24.085 --> 37:31.375
Nothing in Shakespeare's hand, other than six autographs, three in his will, three elsewhere, comes down to us in his hand.

37:31.395 --> 37:41.129
And if you also accept the fact that of 36 plays in this book, fully 20, never appeared anywhere else prior to their publication in 1622 in this book.

37:41.229 --> 37:48.439
And these plays include The Tempest, they include Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, a number of really great plays.

37:49.448 --> 38:06.965
And if you are, as I am, consider myself an acolyte of the altar of Shakespeare, and if you put your hand on this book, and if you realize that this is as close as I can ever come in an artifactual way to the genius of Shakespeare, then yeah, if I have the three million dollars, why not?

38:07.005 --> 38:08.987
I'd love to have it.

38:09.007 --> 38:09.447
It would be wonderful.

38:09.467 --> 38:15.513
Well, the timing of this particular sale was two weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center in the Pentagon.

38:15.533 --> 38:16.434
This was two and a half weeks.

38:16.454 --> 38:17.835
This was still in October.

38:18.102 --> 38:21.745
And there were a lot of misgivings about whether or not they should have this sale at all.

38:21.765 --> 38:27.851
Of course, the president and everyone else of high standing in the country were saying, we have to go on with our lives.

38:27.871 --> 38:28.552
We have to continue.

38:28.592 --> 38:29.333
Great advice.

38:30.113 --> 38:32.035
And so Christie did have the sale.

38:32.055 --> 38:35.999
And the Shakespeare didn't sell for $3 million, as I just said.

38:36.019 --> 38:37.420
It went for $6.2 million.

38:38.121 --> 38:43.105
So you talk about, well, there has to be something to be learned out of that, don't you think, that it has two wits?

38:43.125 --> 38:45.848
I mean, if there is something that two people really want,

38:46.199 --> 38:54.748
And if the book and only one of them can have it, you know, I don't think that there's anything going to stand in the way of that happening.

38:54.768 --> 38:57.932
Well, I went out, like I said, I boxed the compass geographically.

38:57.952 --> 38:59.293
We certainly covered New England.

38:59.694 --> 39:00.615
I went to Florida.

39:00.675 --> 39:07.963
I wrote about a wonderful woman down there who had a great collection of children's books, 200,000 of artists at the University of Florida.

39:07.983 --> 39:09.404
I love telling this story in the South.

39:09.685 --> 39:12.628
The only problem was that when she gave these books, children's books,

39:13.030 --> 39:15.616
18th, 19th, and 20th century children.

39:15.937 --> 39:18.082
She came along with the collection.

39:18.102 --> 39:21.530
It wouldn't allow anybody to use them as long as she was alive.

39:21.550 --> 39:31.714
And I tell the story in General Madness how during the spring lunch, this young student who was trying to get into a fraternity goes over to the library and asks if he could possibly see

39:32.167 --> 39:37.133
Ruth Baldwin, Dr. Baldwin is the Ruth Baldwin woman who put together this collection.

39:37.153 --> 39:39.435
Can I possibly speak with Dr. Baldwin?

39:39.655 --> 39:43.660
He was told that the woman, unfortunately, relatively sadly, had just passed away.

39:44.681 --> 39:47.664
He was sad, he was relieved.

39:47.925 --> 39:50.948
He said, you know, he just told you the woman has just passed away.

39:50.988 --> 39:51.949
Why are you so relieved?

39:52.390 --> 39:58.256
He had been ordered by his fraternity to go over to the library and ask Dr. Baldwin if he could read some of the books.

40:00.078 --> 40:01.600
But, you know, when you think about

40:01.765 --> 40:10.016
Of course, Raymond Teague was telling you that he was down there at the University of Florida when he did the interview down there.

40:10.096 --> 40:13.360
He said, you know, what we have now is one of the great collections of children.

40:13.380 --> 40:17.105
So you do put up with these little things with collectors.

40:17.125 --> 40:21.971
You know, we talk about the eccentricities, the extraordinary foibles that they have.

40:21.991 --> 40:25.195
But in the final analysis, you have the cycle of collectors.

40:25.215 --> 40:29.040
You have the cycle of institutional collectors.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.603
These are all these dynamics that I was trying to write about.

40:32.140 --> 40:36.085
Also boxing the compass in terms of gender, as I mentioned.

40:36.105 --> 40:40.370
You know, for years there's been this horrible libel, but women hated books.

40:41.071 --> 40:44.295
I mean, I'm not saying this, read the General Baptist.

40:44.315 --> 40:52.885
Read some of the people who, well, William Blades, who wrote the enemies of books, I mean, rank women up there right below children.

40:52.905 --> 40:56.089
And dust in them, and water, you know, fire.

40:56.491 --> 41:04.744
Well, I thought that it was important not only to find one or two extraordinary women who collect books, but half a dozen, eight, nine, ten.

41:04.764 --> 41:07.990
I mean, just kind of blow that thing out of the water if you can.

41:08.010 --> 41:14.801
I also wanted to box the compass in terms of race, so therefore I had to go out and find somebody like Charles Watson.

41:14.821 --> 41:20.710
Charles Watson was a great football player at Pennsylvania State University back in the 1950s.

41:20.960 --> 41:25.925
who had an ironclad, no-cut contract to go play football with the New York Giants.

41:25.945 --> 41:31.571
His roommates were Lenny Moore and Roosevelt Greer at Penn State.

41:31.591 --> 41:36.537
Rosie went to the Giants, Lenny Moore went to the Baltimore Colts.

41:37.257 --> 41:41.983
And Charles had this contract, and after one week, he walked away from the New York Giants.

41:42.723 --> 41:47.068
And of course, I later interviewed Lenny Moore, and I said, what did you think he's like?

41:47.217 --> 41:48.278
Charles, you're crazy.

41:48.338 --> 41:49.419
He thought he was really nuts.

41:49.759 --> 41:53.603
Why in the world would you walk away from a career in the 50s?

41:53.643 --> 41:56.105
You talk about a black kid coming up in the 1950s.

41:56.125 --> 41:58.267
Never mind the 1950s.

41:58.287 --> 41:59.588
How about the 80s or the 90s?

41:59.668 --> 42:01.730
If you have this chance, you see this.

42:01.750 --> 42:07.175
And what Charles said, I walked away because I wanted to be, I had to be a black bibliophile.

42:07.315 --> 42:08.876
Those were his words.

42:08.896 --> 42:10.338
That was his expression.

42:10.358 --> 42:15.402
I was growing up in Pennsylvania in the late 40s, early 50s.

42:15.702 --> 42:22.829
He was told by a primary school teacher when he asked, why is it that when I read history books, I never see any mention of black people?

42:22.889 --> 42:27.354
And he was told by the teacher that that's because black people have no history, Charles.

42:27.374 --> 42:28.916
They were born to serve white people.

42:28.936 --> 42:31.458
Now, this is not an apocryphal story.

42:31.719 --> 42:39.266
When Charles later was given a commendation by the state of Pennsylvania, this teacher showed up and publicly apologized.

42:39.287 --> 42:40.748
This is a true story.

42:41.251 --> 42:53.163
But he said, if that's the case, what are all these stories my grandparents and my great-grandparents have been telling me about the underground rills, all of these extraordinary tales, folk tales that have passed on?

42:53.183 --> 43:02.673
Well, he determined at his very early age, he was broke, he would go to the Salvation Army where they would have books for 25 cents and hide the ones he wanted, you know, until they had their nickel and dime sales.

43:03.975 --> 43:10.161
He put together a library that is now 80,000 lawyers at the Temple University, and it is, I believe, one of the four.

43:10.428 --> 43:13.732
great Afro-American collections in the United States.

43:13.752 --> 43:16.875
Of course, the great one is in New York, the Schaumburg Library.

43:16.895 --> 43:20.639
We have a great one here at Harvard, and another great one in Washington, D.C.

43:20.659 --> 43:21.019
at Harvard.

43:21.039 --> 43:25.064
But those, you'd have to say, and the Bloxham collection at Temple.

43:25.084 --> 43:27.026
Well, Charles was somebody we wanted to write about.

43:27.046 --> 43:29.889
Then I also wanted to attend the great options.

43:29.909 --> 43:31.291
I was very, very lucky with it.

43:31.311 --> 43:34.594
The Bradley Martin sale and the Seldo Heaney sale was going on.

43:35.335 --> 43:38.258
A library called the Guyton Library that was put together here in Cambridge.

43:38.761 --> 43:41.465
I attended that sale and wrote about that.

43:41.906 --> 43:46.532
I wrote about all of these particular sales in the sixth chapter of Gentleman.

43:48.855 --> 43:56.286
So therefore, with the collector, I wanted to move into, stay within the realm of book culture.

43:56.927 --> 43:59.871
And we come along now to patience and fortitude.

44:00.632 --> 44:06.000
We are in Boston, so I don't expect all of you to realize that these are the names of the lions that stand in our

44:06.352 --> 44:11.138
in front of the New York Public Library on 5th Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan.

44:11.158 --> 44:31.545
So named during the Great Depression, when Ciarello LaGuardia would get his Sunday night radio broadcast, and unfairly he would, and this was during the Depression, he would always say, what we need to see us through is a great ordeal which lay ahead on him to exercise the twin bridges of patience and fortitude.

44:31.565 --> 44:35.751
Prior to this, the wonderful Tennessee Pink Marble, the Lyons,

44:36.305 --> 44:41.371
have been called Lennox and Astor, I guess.

44:41.391 --> 44:44.475
Judge Jacob Astor and James Lennox.

44:44.495 --> 44:46.377
The names attached to these lions.

44:46.397 --> 44:56.669
Well, I love the idea of lions that are named Patients and Fortisers, and the idea of lions as a metaphor, as an image, guardians of knowledge, guardians of the gates of knowledge.

44:56.689 --> 45:01.815
What a wonderful image, what a wonderful metaphor to have at this time, during these times.

45:01.835 --> 45:04.118
And libraries, the whole institution of the library,

45:04.553 --> 45:09.360
I hesitate to say under attack, but I mean, we had book people here.

45:09.380 --> 45:10.943
You know what I'm talking about.

45:10.963 --> 45:13.166
You know where we're coming from on this.

45:13.186 --> 45:24.503
I mean, I write about libraries and patient support as an institution that was established in Florida in 1995, a state university at Fort Myers, Florida Gulf Coast State University.

45:25.242 --> 45:27.705
The founding president said, I mean, this is on record.

45:27.725 --> 45:28.967
He's very proud of this statement.

45:29.027 --> 45:35.557
He said, I want an institution with a library that is no larger than a telephone booth.

45:35.577 --> 45:43.868
As it turns out, he did hire a librarian from Brandeis and did get him 120,000 books from Uppsala College, which went bankrupt a few years ago.

45:43.888 --> 45:45.090
He's very fortunate.

45:45.110 --> 45:46.772
And they do have a respectable library.

45:46.792 --> 45:48.735
I say flat out in that chapter,

45:49.188 --> 45:53.557
I make a declarative statement.

45:54.900 --> 46:06.565
Today, the finest colleges and universities in the United States are still measured to great extent by the depth and sophistication of their libraries, their print collections.

46:06.585 --> 46:10.032
I try to give you stories that document this whole concept.

46:10.535 --> 46:13.919
I did not, in patience and fortitude, forget my collector.

46:14.019 --> 46:17.384
I didn't leave the collector, but I didn't forget the collector.

46:17.404 --> 46:20.007
Chapter 3 of that book is called Madness Redux.

46:21.349 --> 46:23.611
Abel Burland is one of the collectors in there.

46:23.632 --> 46:25.254
There are six collectors in there.

46:25.534 --> 46:29.098
People say, well, how come you didn't have these six people in General Madness?

46:29.239 --> 46:31.241
Had I known about them at the time, they would have been there.

46:32.022 --> 46:34.365
They certainly deserve to be in there, but they are also what I

46:34.835 --> 46:41.583
I like to think of as scholar bookers, people who not only collect their books, but use their books, know their books.

46:42.063 --> 46:51.053
Collecting books are the purpose that is beyond just merely decorations and curiosities in a library.

46:51.073 --> 47:00.724
I also have a chapter that I call Hunters and Gatherers, about scholar booksellers, human booksellers, because they were developed by the co-files in that particular chapter.

47:01.987 --> 47:08.455
So it's this whole culture, this whole concept of the fellowship of books, this community of book people.

47:08.475 --> 47:11.359
Now, I did bring along with me today a few visual aids.

47:11.379 --> 47:14.302
I've never done this before, but I only live out in that time.

47:14.322 --> 47:17.386
In fact, I don't know if I was going to be schlepping this thing from the heart of the garage.

47:17.406 --> 47:26.357
I wouldn't have carried it, but I don't know how many of you are familiar with A Gentle Madness, but Chapter 13 is called the Blumberg Collection.

47:26.978 --> 47:33.066
That is, for those of you unfamiliar with Stephen Blumberg, let me just say briefly that he was a collector.

47:33.086 --> 47:34.768
It is kind of an ironic title.

47:35.950 --> 47:49.928
He got a collection of 23,000 books gathered from 368 libraries in 45 states, two Canadian provinces in the District of Columbia over a 20-year period.

47:49.948 --> 47:50.949
22,000 books.

47:51.049 --> 47:56.817
Some estimates were that the value was up to, could have been as much as $20 million.

47:56.915 --> 48:02.141
Then there were other estimates of $7 million, but I think that was a way he served.

48:02.161 --> 48:12.073
When you saw the Nuremberg Chronicle that he had from Claremont College and its original pink, pig-skinned, blind-stand findings, I think the estimate was $100,000.

48:12.593 --> 48:20.243
He had the state of Connecticut's own copy of the first book printed in Connecticut, A Confession of Faith, which he moved from Connecticut State Library.

48:20.263 --> 48:22.365
To this state, nobody knows how he got in there.

48:23.138 --> 48:25.120
This is a library that does not circulate.

48:25.220 --> 48:28.423
I don't even know if you can go in there and read, depending on the truth.

48:28.443 --> 48:29.925
Somehow, Stephen got in there.

48:30.365 --> 48:36.291
While he was there, getting the confession of faith, he had some friends traveling with him.

48:37.092 --> 48:43.798
He sent them across the street, one of the visual ways, to get some doorknobs up to state capitals.

48:43.818 --> 48:47.041
They also had 50,000 doorknobs.

48:47.502 --> 48:48.102
This is one.

48:48.122 --> 48:49.804
He gave them to me.

48:50.273 --> 48:53.378
I'm trying to carry this on an airplane today.

48:53.998 --> 48:55.441
You can carry it.

48:56.662 --> 49:04.073
When I attended his trial in Des Moines in 1991, a two-week trial, I got to know Stephen fairly well.

49:04.554 --> 49:08.059
I'm the only person today who has had any interview with him.

49:08.079 --> 49:14.188
I'm the only journalist who has allowed him the secret warehouse that the FBI had put together

49:14.422 --> 49:17.505
handle these books, to process these books, and to return them.

49:17.526 --> 49:22.932
Did I mention that 95% of these books were never known to be missing until the day they were discovered?

49:22.952 --> 49:27.236
An interesting point, because he had removed all the book plates, you see.

49:27.257 --> 49:29.299
He hadn't really defaced the books otherwise.

49:29.319 --> 49:32.442
He took very good care of them, but he did remove the book plates.

49:32.863 --> 49:35.846
He put the book plates in three stop-locks.

49:38.669 --> 49:43.635
Prosecution next exhibit, number 12, is this.

49:43.953 --> 49:49.762
I only had a lot of plates with scrapbooks.

49:49.882 --> 49:54.228
He had these three scrapbooks, a collection of 1,200 book plates.

49:54.248 --> 49:56.111
There was a collection that was in the collection.

49:56.131 --> 50:03.863
I told my friend Martin Antonini, the steward of the team, he was a books librarian at Smith College, and I said, Nick, did he ever hit here?

50:03.943 --> 50:06.687
We never knew whether or not he'd gotten in store.

50:07.072 --> 50:08.354
And I have the book here.

50:10.637 --> 50:14.784
I emailed, I said, Mark, I hate to try to do it, but there are six, let's book play for me.

50:14.824 --> 50:18.690
But don't feel so bad because Amherst College is on the facing page.

50:18.710 --> 50:21.734
Mount Holyoke is in the next page.

50:21.915 --> 50:22.676
Amherst is there.

50:22.756 --> 50:23.998
Then he crosses the border.

50:24.018 --> 50:27.864
He goes across, he goes into New York and he hits Cornell and he goes down to Bard.

50:27.904 --> 50:31.509
These are the most extraordinary things I do.

50:31.549 --> 50:32.691
So he's selected quickly.

50:32.958 --> 50:35.561
These are four that I like.

50:35.962 --> 50:37.184
These are very unusual.

50:37.204 --> 50:38.946
These are Stanford University Library book places.

50:38.966 --> 50:40.048
And I have them here.

50:40.228 --> 50:42.010
I have three of them.

50:43.132 --> 50:45.315
I will read you what these are.

50:45.335 --> 50:47.057
These are very, almost in theory, if you see them.

50:47.077 --> 50:52.424
Because he put them together in a way that documented his travels, the way he traveled around.

50:52.444 --> 50:54.647
And this one, I mean, he's cooking like antique books.

50:56.089 --> 50:58.612
But he wrote, put a little sticker in here.

50:58.632 --> 51:00.535
And these are his drawings here.

51:00.734 --> 51:09.208
But it says, a hungry man who steals a piece of beef to save his life is called a common thief to save his life.

51:09.228 --> 51:13.474
A thief much commonerly often finds and rubs on our bookshelves to improve his mind.

51:14.256 --> 51:20.185
Improve your morals, inconsiderate elves, and then your minds will soon improve themselves.

51:20.205 --> 51:22.709
I think we've gotten a joke about that.

51:22.729 --> 51:26.455
I acquired these quite legally, quite legitimately.

51:26.890 --> 51:30.653
Probably 23,000 books which he removed from these libraries.

51:30.673 --> 51:38.240
About 3,500 could never be determined where they came from because, again, he had taken out the book plate.

51:38.260 --> 51:45.747
At one point during the seven-hour tape recording interview that I had with him, he said to me, Nick, shut off your tape recorder.

51:45.767 --> 51:46.228
And I said, OK.

51:46.888 --> 51:51.673
He was holding out this chip, you see, his knowledge of where all the books had come from.

51:51.693 --> 51:56.357
And he said, you know the Uncle Tom's Cabin they think I got from Harvard?

51:57.468 --> 52:07.642
So there were still 3,500 books that they could never determine where they came from.

52:07.702 --> 52:16.594
The FBI did give those books to Creighton University, which had assisted them in trying to determine where so many of these books came from.

52:16.614 --> 52:21.040
It was quite an interesting exercise in what we might call forensic bibliography.

52:21.060 --> 52:26.327
I know Roger Stoddard of Harvard went out there and looked and determined, well, we know

52:26.628 --> 52:31.955
that we used a certain kind of tape at Harvard, for instance, but other libraries don't.

52:31.975 --> 52:38.443
So they were able to identify books, and of course the fact that they were missing some of the books that they later determined were there.

52:38.463 --> 52:51.420
But these were turned over to Creighton, and then Creighton sold a number of the books that they were interested in to the bookseller, who contacted me and said, the one person in the world who thought could have these was me.

52:52.210 --> 52:56.035
proud owner of them, and if anyone would like to look at them, you're welcome to afterwards.

52:56.055 --> 53:00.261
I just asked if there are a number of loose book plates in here.

53:01.402 --> 53:10.995
He was arrested before he had a time to stick them in, but they are where he left them, so if you see some... I gave a talk at the Aquarius Society, there were peasants

53:11.414 --> 53:16.362
I would hear these shrieks going, oh no!

53:16.382 --> 53:20.228
You know, a fellow from Ontario, oh no!

53:20.268 --> 53:21.270
Two book places!

53:23.714 --> 53:30.845
Stephen would, uh, the book would be thrown off, you see, this particular, I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to laugh, he's in prison.

53:31.145 --> 53:35.312
No, after a librarian here, I should point out that, uh,

53:36.136 --> 53:37.358
He was convicted, by the way.

53:37.378 --> 53:39.723
His defense was not guilty by reason of insanity.

53:39.884 --> 53:47.098
Now, if you have a book called The Gentle Madness, you know, a fellow that's stolen 23,000 books, and his defense is not guilty by reason of insanity.

53:47.118 --> 53:48.922
That's a pretty interesting story.

53:49.002 --> 53:54.513
Well, I'm supposed to be writing about the positive aspects of bibliomania.

53:54.553 --> 53:57.098
Now I've got this data.

53:57.432 --> 54:23.929
368 library well i like to think that excess you know is always destructive that the collector who goes over the cliff can be a very very interesting person um he took me to his warehouse i should tell you about the warehouse when the court was in recess in des moines he asked me if i'd like to spend a day with him and i did indeed and we went down to watumwa where he had been arrested

54:24.449 --> 54:27.112
the city where Radar O'Reilly's M.A.S.H.

54:27.232 --> 54:31.356
fame was from, and where Stephen had decided he wanted to set up his great library.

54:31.376 --> 54:33.979
Look at the map, you know, it's the middle of the country.

54:33.999 --> 54:37.223
He still had five states to go by the time he was arrested.

54:37.243 --> 54:38.424
They intended to get all 50.

54:38.524 --> 54:43.850
It really bothered him that a fellow by the name of God... My goodness, I can't think of it.

54:43.890 --> 54:46.593
Who was a great book thief before they arrested Stephen?

54:46.673 --> 54:50.977
The man who's escaping... No, not Hoffman.

54:50.997 --> 54:52.279
I can't think of the name right now.

54:52.299 --> 54:52.899
It'll come to me afterwards.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.321
But this guy was being...

54:54.487 --> 54:57.672
He was touted as the great book thief of the 20th century.

54:57.692 --> 54:58.994
He was driving Stephen nuts.

54:59.014 --> 55:01.958
He wasn't getting the recognition he was.

55:02.078 --> 55:04.241
I really believe he wanted to be arrested.

55:04.261 --> 55:06.565
He was pleased to be arrested.

55:06.585 --> 55:08.888
He was delighted in the notoriety.

55:09.189 --> 55:09.850
He was convicted.

55:09.870 --> 55:11.612
He spent seven years in prison.

55:11.632 --> 55:12.213
He was let out.

55:12.534 --> 55:18.603
He was told, don't go near any of his libraries, bookstores, museums, or condemned houses.

55:18.623 --> 55:20.445
Those four things.

55:21.928 --> 55:24.291
Condemned houses, you say.

55:24.608 --> 55:26.950
when he was growing up in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis.

55:26.970 --> 55:28.331
This is how this thing starts.

55:28.752 --> 55:37.599
He was one of the most knowledgeable people I know of in antiques, American stained glass windows, corn-outs, fixtures.

55:37.880 --> 55:39.601
He would go into all of these condemned houses.

55:39.621 --> 55:40.742
This is how we got started.

55:40.762 --> 55:45.286
He would go in and pull out corn-outs like this, fixtures.

55:45.486 --> 55:46.387
He gave me one of these.

55:46.427 --> 55:48.048
It's a memento of our day together.

55:48.949 --> 55:49.630
And he did ask me.

55:49.670 --> 55:52.492
He said, would you like a memento of my day together?

55:52.512 --> 55:53.333
I said, well, I'd love one.

55:53.735 --> 55:54.617
But it is stolen.

55:55.979 --> 55:57.783
And he says, I'm only charged with books.

55:58.023 --> 55:58.845
You know, not to worry.

55:59.466 --> 56:05.978
So I took it, you know, with the understanding that I wasn't receiving stolen property.

56:06.559 --> 56:08.904
When I did get back to Des Moines, I checked with the FBI.

56:09.004 --> 56:10.006
He said, don't worry about it.

56:10.026 --> 56:11.088
We're only charging with books.

56:11.128 --> 56:13.853
So you're unclear on that.

56:14.423 --> 56:20.791
But his goal, he said, was to create this great reference library, this great reference library of Americana.

56:20.811 --> 56:25.137
I said, well, how does that explain the 100 incunables that you have?

56:25.577 --> 56:31.244
Books, as you know, that are more than 500 years old, printed in the dawn, the infancy of printing.

56:31.264 --> 56:34.048
He said, well, you know, collectors, once we get started.

56:34.108 --> 56:39.615
He had 100 incunables which he kept in the California room in his house.

56:39.635 --> 56:43.620
So named because that was his favorite state for hunting, as he said.

56:44.225 --> 56:52.474
He told me the story of climbing up an elevator shaft at Claremont College at night, and all of a sudden the elevator started to come down.

56:52.494 --> 56:53.615
He didn't get anyone in there.

56:53.635 --> 56:57.520
Imagine getting killed climbing an elevator shaft to get a book.

56:57.540 --> 57:00.843
He went into burning buildings once to get books.

57:00.863 --> 57:02.805
He used to disguise himself as a professor.

57:03.206 --> 57:06.970
He got the ID of a professor at the University of Minnesota.

57:07.050 --> 57:09.793
He moved to California and assumed the identity of this man.

57:10.432 --> 57:14.098
He told me, now I was able to elevate the level of my activity.

57:14.179 --> 57:18.546
He was now confined just to the general stacks if you go to special collections.

57:18.566 --> 57:19.909
He actually had stature.

57:19.969 --> 57:23.535
He would arrive as a visiting professor with portfolio.

57:23.555 --> 57:24.056
That's amazing.

57:25.198 --> 57:29.666
He entered into evidence in addition to these three books.

57:29.686 --> 57:32.811
You will understand I couldn't obtain these, but there were ten rings of keys.

57:33.432 --> 57:34.413
keys that he had made.

57:34.453 --> 57:38.659
He would come into a place like Harvard or Boston University or wherever.

57:38.679 --> 57:41.883
I mean, perhaps as many as 60 or 70 keys.

57:41.903 --> 57:43.405
I think more than that.

57:43.465 --> 57:44.626
He was also a locksmith.

57:44.646 --> 57:45.207
He would go in.

57:45.227 --> 57:48.211
He would find the desk of the person he knew was in charge.

57:48.271 --> 57:49.192
He would find the keys.

57:49.212 --> 57:50.614
He would make a copy of the keys.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.897
He would make copies of security keys.

57:52.917 --> 57:53.578
He'd come back.

57:53.858 --> 57:55.380
He knew the books that he wanted.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.022
He said, I'm a collector.

57:57.042 --> 57:58.043
I'm not an accumulator.

57:58.064 --> 57:59.185
He made it very clear.

57:59.325 --> 58:00.086
He was not an accumulator.

58:00.106 --> 58:00.807
He was a collector.

58:01.546 --> 58:07.553
And then when the FBI put the books in the warehouse, I said, well, what did you think when you went out to the warehouse and saw the books?

58:07.573 --> 58:12.218
He said, well, they messed up my shelving, you know, my shelving.

58:12.238 --> 58:14.201
And I said, well, Steve, don't you think?

58:14.221 --> 58:15.642
He said, I know, I know, pro bonots.

58:15.743 --> 58:18.806
He said, they have them all by pro bonots.

58:18.826 --> 58:29.899
You wonder why you have to go out, and I'll conclude with this, why you have to go out as a reporter, as a journalist, as a researcher, even with all the internet and the searching capabilities, to go out and

58:30.352 --> 58:34.838
I mean, I could have written that chapter on Bloomberg.

58:36.020 --> 58:37.001
I had been to the trials.

58:37.082 --> 58:39.905
Did I have to make a special flight out there?

58:39.926 --> 58:40.566
Omaha and Alaska.

58:40.627 --> 58:42.028
Nobody was allowed in.

58:42.049 --> 58:43.851
The FBI was adamant I couldn't get in.

58:43.871 --> 58:49.699
Finally, the day he was sentenced, they said, you can come, but you can only have 15 minutes in here.

58:49.719 --> 58:52.063
I said, I don't know what you want to come out here for anyway.

58:52.083 --> 58:54.947
All you're going to see is an old book, a library.

58:54.967 --> 58:56.829
You know, the idea.

58:56.849 --> 58:59.413
Well, I went out there, met under a...

59:00.153 --> 59:01.895
flagpole and McDonald's resting.

59:01.935 --> 59:04.239
He said, I'm not going to blindfold you.

59:04.259 --> 59:05.020
I said, don't worry.

59:05.040 --> 59:05.881
You don't have to worry about that.

59:05.901 --> 59:06.482
He took me in.

59:07.103 --> 59:10.227
Spent 20 minutes there, maybe five extra minutes.

59:10.307 --> 59:11.909
I start that chapter.

59:11.930 --> 59:13.171
It wasn't the book so much.

59:13.572 --> 59:15.214
It was, again, the protonizer.

59:15.234 --> 59:21.263
He said some signs that were on these steel shelves that really caught my attention.

59:21.723 --> 59:23.386
There I say Harvard.

59:23.426 --> 59:24.227
There I say Library of Congress.

59:24.247 --> 59:26.850
There I say the University of Wisconsin, UIC.

59:26.870 --> 59:29.434
And that was a great cultural offense, in my view.

59:29.887 --> 59:32.210
You know, Stephen is kind of funny to talk about.

59:32.230 --> 59:37.097
He's getting out of prison, by the way, on July the 3rd.

59:37.117 --> 59:41.223
He got out five years ago, and the first thing he did was go to a condemned building.

59:41.383 --> 59:45.208
I mean, he's caught stealing fixtures and doorknobs, and they gave him five years.

59:45.629 --> 59:49.174
And every time he's supposed to get out, he was originally supposed to get out in October.

59:49.474 --> 59:51.377
He was supposed to get out next week, May 28th.

59:51.457 --> 59:54.801
I just checked with my detective client in Des Moines.

59:54.821 --> 59:57.024
It's now been extended to July the 4th.

59:57.044 --> 59:58.206
He keeps doing something.

59:59.097 --> 01:00:01.079
to keep them in a bit longer.

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:02.721
Maybe they'll see me forever.

01:00:03.082 --> 01:00:03.843
God knows.

01:00:03.863 --> 01:00:07.647
Because prison has not been good to students, shall I say.

01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:10.350
This is not a case where you have had rehabilitation.

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.414
I will conclude my remarks, but I can find it here.

01:00:13.714 --> 01:00:15.797
Yes, I will.

01:00:15.817 --> 01:00:23.786
I think the words of this final paragraph from the first chapter of my forthcoming book, Among the Gentlemen, is appropriate to the Tickness Society.

01:00:24.127 --> 01:00:25.408
I'll just read this paragraph.

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:53.100
I say, as we embark forthwith on the pleasant task of sharing sea stories with the gently man, I am reminded of a volume of literary criticism that I keep on the shelf near my computer, not so much to peruse its content, which let the record show I beautifully did read when it came across my desk as a review copy of 1979, but to glance during idle moments on the wonderful title the writer Marvin Murdick chose for his essay.

01:00:53.654 --> 01:00:59.170
A string of eight words and a question mark that express the sentiment I confess that I savor on a daily basis.

01:01:00.313 --> 01:01:03.001
Books are not life, but then what is.

01:01:04.184 --> 01:01:04.665
Thanks a lot.

01:01:04.726 --> 01:01:06.751
I really appreciate it.

01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:06.972
Thank you.

01:01:23.962 --> 01:01:44.350
reflected that would be cool we could talk during the reception if anybody wants to look at the catalogs i have a brief uh announcement to uh to make before we get to the real pleasure uh the library started so we have no trouble getting
