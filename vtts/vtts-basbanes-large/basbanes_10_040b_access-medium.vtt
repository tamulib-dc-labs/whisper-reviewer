00:03.457 --> 00:04.778
How these things are regulated?

00:08.422 --> 00:09.243
You told me it stopped.

00:13.448 --> 00:17.613
So, there is a rule, there is an important thing going.

00:18.113 --> 00:19.154
No, it's still going, okay.

00:19.415 --> 00:20.456
What it does is this.

00:21.056 --> 00:22.898
It regulates everyday life affairs.

00:23.579 --> 00:33.430
How many hours you sleep, how many hours you work, how you pray, and how you enter the monastery, how many years must you be a novice before you are out and so forth.

00:33.798 --> 01:00.278
Let me ask you a much more important question.

01:00.646 --> 01:04.310
You told me you were born in 1945, so that makes you 52 years old.

01:04.350 --> 01:05.011
I'm 55.

01:05.631 --> 01:09.876
And you started going when you were a young man in your 20s.

01:09.896 --> 01:14.901
Do you expect that you'll be going there as long as you live?

01:15.402 --> 01:16.103
Most definitely.

01:16.123 --> 01:20.888
You know, I don't feel right if I don't go four or five times a year.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.149
I have friends there.

01:22.890 --> 01:25.793
You know, they come down to Thessaloniki, they visit me.

01:26.330 --> 01:40.031
My wife got upset when once upon a time a monk who was newly wed and the monk blessed her and said, I wish we had 40 sons and 40 daughters and my wife flipped out.

01:41.252 --> 01:43.115
Don't bring this man back here again.

01:43.255 --> 01:45.098
That's funny.

01:45.879 --> 01:48.423
Do you learn something new every time you go?

01:48.984 --> 01:50.947
Do you experience something different every time you go?

01:50.967 --> 01:54.953
Well, there are some things I...

01:55.675 --> 01:59.140
There are some men, there are some charismatic men.

02:01.042 --> 02:07.631
I'm sure you all know about this famous Russian monk, Father Grigori.

02:08.512 --> 02:09.734
Okay?

02:11.236 --> 02:14.400
He used his charisma the negative way.

02:16.863 --> 02:22.611
I met men in Mount Athos that have the charisma and use it the right way.

02:31.923 --> 02:45.801
Actually, their spirituality overwhelms you.

02:45.841 --> 02:57.255
I don't consider myself to be a very

02:57.893 --> 02:58.614
Religious men.

02:58.975 --> 02:59.816
Devoutly, really.

02:59.836 --> 03:00.076
Yes.

03:00.557 --> 03:01.318
That's the way you want.

03:01.578 --> 03:06.325
Yes, precisely.

03:06.346 --> 03:27.597
And yet the spiritual... However, however, at one time I was so moved by my brief encounter with one

03:28.235 --> 03:36.042
of one such man, such monk, a famous one, that I came back really perplexed.

03:37.103 --> 03:46.052
I felt that this man who was standing opposite me, he could x-ray my soul.

03:46.632 --> 03:50.316
It was an amazing experience.

03:50.336 --> 03:53.959
And precisely this is what I thought.

03:54.079 --> 03:56.301
That's the positive side of Father Grigori.

03:57.422 --> 03:58.123
The positive side.

03:58.576 --> 04:28.431
they can you leave the meeting such a man with an amazing peace of mind and soul the spiritual power of these people is a few of them not all of them some of them smell of garlic and all this but I say the spirituality

04:28.968 --> 04:31.751
If you look for it, you can find it, you'd be amazed.

04:31.771 --> 04:45.064
And again, the whole atmosphere is overwhelming and inspires you and... So let's say somebody wants to become a monk.

04:45.665 --> 04:45.885
Yes.

04:46.105 --> 04:50.770
You just go there and... You go there, you must have some connections.

04:51.130 --> 04:58.738
And you were given some lower tasks as washing and cleaning and things and if you can prove

04:58.904 --> 05:05.113
which they call or obedience for a given period of time.

05:05.153 --> 05:08.938
And if you can get along with the rest of the Brotherhood, yes.

05:10.781 --> 05:12.704
It's pretty democratic.

05:12.744 --> 05:16.349
You know, anyone can go out, anyone can leave, anytime they decide.

05:16.409 --> 05:18.752
There's no strict rules.

05:21.556 --> 05:22.378
You don't have to ask.

05:22.518 --> 05:24.000
You just say, I want to go.

05:24.901 --> 05:25.141
Yes.

05:26.664 --> 05:27.645
Well, of course,

05:28.199 --> 05:37.194
If that is overdone, they can probably send you away, but this is very rarely done.

05:37.214 --> 05:40.439
Once a month, always a month.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.004
For a long time I've been going in and out.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.668
My basic sentiment

05:46.610 --> 05:49.854
is definitely positive concerning Mount Athos.

05:50.375 --> 06:02.492
There are some people I don't want to know, some people are very displeasing and they have nothing to do with monasticism except the cloth.

06:02.532 --> 06:08.300
But again, this is life.

06:09.001 --> 06:12.786
And let's not forget that monks are nothing else

06:13.002 --> 06:25.523
Nothing different, but our brothers, our mothers, who perhaps realize more than we do how different we are.

06:25.984 --> 06:28.288
It's a different philosophy.

06:28.969 --> 06:31.393
So maybe we should go over a few things about what I have to do.

06:31.974 --> 06:32.675
Yes.

06:32.755 --> 06:35.500
I can always get in touch with you?

06:35.540 --> 06:36.782
You can call me.
