WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:26.908
I use Vietnam the same way that upside uses suburbia.

00:26.968 --> 00:32.113
I mean, it's not writing about

00:32.870 --> 00:41.660
He's writing about the human heart, and he knows suburbia, and there's certain pressures that accumulate in suburbia, certain pressures that accumulate in war.

00:43.002 --> 00:51.892
And so I used war, Vietnam in particular, as a backdrop for moral choice, a place where the human heart can get squeezed.

00:53.334 --> 00:58.820
The same, I suppose, as Conrad used the ocean.

00:59.721 --> 01:01.543
To call him an ocean rider,

01:02.401 --> 01:03.863
It's a little ridiculous.

01:03.903 --> 01:05.404
They call Shakespeare a king writer.

01:07.426 --> 01:09.609
It's a little ridiculous.

01:09.629 --> 01:17.297
You have, of course, one novel in particular that you did venture away from.

01:18.378 --> 01:21.401
Was that an experiment for you?

01:21.521 --> 01:24.645
No, that was still on the other side of the coin.

01:24.665 --> 01:25.305
There was a war.

01:25.426 --> 01:26.306
It's a nuclear age, you mean.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.729
A war that everybody hated.

01:29.755 --> 01:33.319
That's a book I kind of like still, but nobody seemed to find it funny, so maybe it's not.

01:33.339 --> 01:34.000
I thought it was funny.

01:35.823 --> 01:37.144
The book that worries me is this one.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.550
It's my best book by far.

01:41.630 --> 01:45.595
You haven't read the final version, unfortunately.

01:46.516 --> 01:48.198
I mean, radically.

01:48.218 --> 01:49.760
I mean, that pissed me off a bit.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.586
They sent out an early version that was done months ago for the ABA.

01:54.606 --> 01:55.527
That's what I bet.

01:56.128 --> 01:59.492
Well, hell, I mean, there were two go-throughs since then.

02:00.417 --> 02:10.670
You know, the things that I did were very important, one of which is to tell a reader on page 30 in a big footnote that if you're looking for solutions, read a different book.

02:11.491 --> 02:12.673
I have one of my notes here.

02:12.693 --> 02:14.535
This is a pure mystery.

02:14.555 --> 02:15.056
Yeah.

02:15.076 --> 02:15.877
A pure mystery.

02:15.917 --> 02:17.038
That's right.

02:18.020 --> 02:18.921
A pure mystery.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.263
A pure mystery.

02:20.283 --> 02:21.544
And the purest sense.

02:21.564 --> 02:22.385
And you use that phrase.

02:22.465 --> 02:23.567
I had written it down before.

02:23.627 --> 02:23.907
Yeah.

02:23.927 --> 02:24.828
Before I said it was a book.

02:24.868 --> 02:25.429
And it is.

02:25.509 --> 02:27.131
There's no solution.

02:27.993 --> 02:29.935
A mystery isn't a mystery if it has a solution.

02:30.320 --> 02:38.388
And when you're trying to do literature, you're trying to do what the world is.

02:38.748 --> 02:40.010
And the world is a mystery.

02:40.030 --> 02:45.475
If you've ever solved the problem of love yourself, congratulations, I have it.

02:47.237 --> 02:47.978
Love's a mystery.

02:49.299 --> 02:50.200
Deceit's a mystery.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.262
The things we do for love are mysteries.

02:53.283 --> 02:54.124
What happened to people?

02:54.384 --> 02:56.366
Where's your high school girlfriend now?

02:56.746 --> 02:57.307
What's she doing?

02:58.248 --> 02:58.588
Is she dead?

02:59.058 --> 03:00.660
Married to a stockbroker, happy.

03:01.622 --> 03:02.483
Is she so cute?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.144
So cute?

03:03.965 --> 03:06.028
So vibrant?

03:06.048 --> 03:07.490
Where is she?

03:07.510 --> 03:09.753
Those questions, what happens just after we die?

03:10.333 --> 03:12.356
They're mysteries.

03:12.376 --> 03:14.419
And they're important to the human condition.

03:16.382 --> 03:17.123
Is there a God?

03:19.045 --> 03:22.690
Is he benevolent?

03:22.710 --> 03:26.195
Life is riddled with mystery, and I wanted to write a real mystery, not a fake one.

03:26.215 --> 03:27.477
From the beginning?

03:27.497 --> 03:27.597
Yeah.

03:28.049 --> 03:29.671
That's why the book is structured, if it is.

03:30.312 --> 03:33.255
Why the hell else would I put in hypotheses?

03:34.336 --> 03:35.998
If I knew the answer, there wouldn't be any hypotheses.

03:36.779 --> 03:38.261
Do you know the answer?

03:38.281 --> 03:39.242
No.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.684
If I knew the answer, I wouldn't care.

03:40.704 --> 03:44.108
If you knew the answer, ooh, did Oswald act alone in killing Kennedy?

03:45.029 --> 03:49.694
If we knew... If you wrote a script, you might know.

03:49.714 --> 03:51.276
It wasn't answered very well, yeah.

03:52.558 --> 03:53.979
We wouldn't want to write that script.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.800
It wouldn't be interesting.

03:55.521 --> 03:57.263
In fact, there wouldn't be a movie called JFK.

03:59.538 --> 04:03.442
We would know that, you know, it would be like making a movie of Truman dying, dying of old age.

04:03.802 --> 04:05.904
That's sort of a pseudo answer.

04:05.924 --> 04:06.945
That's a pretty good answer.

04:07.025 --> 04:14.573
You know, it's a pretty good example because the mystery, the reason the movie was made is that it's an example type of hypothesis.

04:15.454 --> 04:16.235
It's one hypothesis.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.617
There are many others.

04:19.478 --> 04:20.619
Aren't there?

04:20.639 --> 04:21.460
Lots of them.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.121
And that's one.

04:22.201 --> 04:23.442
And there always will be.

04:23.502 --> 04:24.583
Same with Amelia Earhart.

04:24.985 --> 04:27.449
We remember things, and we're curious because we don't know.

04:27.549 --> 04:30.634
That's why Lizzie Borden laughed, and why a million other murderers didn't.

04:31.135 --> 04:32.597
Because we don't really know.

04:32.798 --> 04:33.098
O.J.

04:33.379 --> 04:34.180
Simpson, right?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.282
Yeah, there's that mystery.

04:35.322 --> 04:38.487
It's kind of weird that I'm reading this book while this is going on.

04:38.968 --> 04:43.195
This guy does have a modicum of, your man has a modicum of celebrity here.

04:43.736 --> 04:46.139
He doesn't have the demons in his closet that O.J.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.702
does, and we don't know that yet, do we?

04:48.847 --> 04:49.828
That's right, we don't know.

04:50.409 --> 04:52.052
White man's got some demons, but don't we all?

04:52.092 --> 04:52.873
Yeah, don't we all.

04:53.314 --> 04:59.242
They're not on that scale, but... I was taken by a lot of the images that we've heard.

04:59.262 --> 05:00.564
I mean, the pink, of course.

05:00.584 --> 05:05.311
The pink bill, the cover, the pink coat.

05:05.331 --> 05:09.778
And, uh... Let me say, if I'm glad you're in my class in the beginning, I will clean it up.

05:09.798 --> 05:10.499
Well, I know you will.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.882
In Q&A, you'll have to.

05:12.962 --> 05:15.146
Nobody's ever pitched about my interviews.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.828
I'm sure.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.542
You did interrupt this book.

05:20.582 --> 05:28.350
You were working on this and then you stepped away to do the things they carried.

05:28.510 --> 05:30.572
Well, thank God I stepped away.

05:30.592 --> 05:33.015
Tell me a little bit.

05:33.035 --> 05:33.756
You were blocked?

05:33.836 --> 05:36.298
No, I wasn't blocked.

05:36.338 --> 05:40.062
I knew the form was risky.

05:41.744 --> 05:45.448
I knew that evidence and hypothesis was going to piss a lot of readers off.

05:46.559 --> 05:52.686
If that book were written without those two elements, you know, that could be a bestseller, you know, if I had an answer on it.

05:53.347 --> 05:54.888
But I'm not interested in that.

05:55.049 --> 05:57.531
I'm interested in life.

05:57.992 --> 06:02.857
And so I stopped to make my mind up whether I was going to carry through on the risk or not.

06:03.298 --> 06:14.170
I always envisioned the book as a series of hypotheses, no answers, a mixture of real-life testimonies from real politicians, real fillers that me lie.

06:15.837 --> 06:38.537
Do you still believe it's risky?

06:39.040 --> 06:39.661
Yeah.

06:40.362 --> 06:41.423
Wait till the reviews come out.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.067
Some are going to love it, some are going to hate it.

06:44.127 --> 06:49.974
Let's also say, for the record, that as you speak, it's August 3, and the book is still two months away from publication.

06:50.034 --> 06:53.258
The next piece appears in the day, right above the time you go back to Minnesota.

06:53.278 --> 06:54.360
But I already know what's going to happen.

06:54.460 --> 06:55.081
What's going to happen?

06:57.244 --> 07:02.631
I'm going to get great reviews and fabulous reviews, and I'm going to get the worst reviews you can imagine.

07:02.831 --> 07:03.732
But that's cool, isn't it?

07:04.285 --> 07:14.017
Well, it's not so cool if you ask if you're receiving the end of the bad one.

07:14.558 --> 07:16.821
I've already gotten so many responses that I can tell.

07:16.881 --> 07:25.352
Some people say, man, I wanted a book with a solution, and I wanted a book that wasn't going to be interrupted with evidence.

07:25.432 --> 07:30.799
And others say, man, without that, it wouldn't be a very interesting book.

07:31.893 --> 07:33.996
I don't mind the evidence.

07:34.016 --> 07:36.460
In fact, I thought it was a pretty nice device.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.544
That's one of the things I did change, but pretty radically.

07:39.624 --> 07:40.646
I cut back a lot of it.

07:42.008 --> 07:45.854
It was an authorial voice that you do insert.

07:45.894 --> 07:48.157
Now you say you said something on page 30.

07:48.317 --> 07:52.784
I know his arrival on page 21 on the first panel.

07:53.245 --> 07:56.690
And I said, oh, a voice.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.913
A voice coming in from the side here.

07:59.264 --> 08:00.866
Who is this guy?

08:00.886 --> 08:02.248
Page 30, I got blunt.

08:02.288 --> 08:14.125
I mean, I thought, well, why not just say, you know, I put in a lot of stuff in that book saying, you know, the software out there saying there's not going to be any solution to this.

08:14.146 --> 08:15.447
But I wanted to do it bluntly.

08:15.948 --> 08:17.951
So I decided I'm going to put a footnote in there really.

08:18.872 --> 08:22.878
And then the reader, I think it was hard a little bit, the reader said, well, I'm not going to get an answer.

08:22.898 --> 08:26.764
But I don't know.

08:26.844 --> 08:28.326
People, in my opinion,

08:30.297 --> 08:33.340
There's something about what we don't know that both fascinates and irritates us.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.323
That's why we're still interested in, you know, Millier Heart and things like that.

08:37.864 --> 08:38.965
And it's also how the heart is.

08:40.106 --> 08:42.368
You know, the people really love us and how much.

08:42.608 --> 08:46.492
Well, so tell me where this, I know that you've always experimented with forms.

08:46.772 --> 08:52.417
You've always tried to do something different.

08:52.437 --> 08:53.218
Life is a miserable forest.

08:53.238 --> 08:55.320
It's a pageant.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.583
But tell me where this idea came from.

08:58.883 --> 09:01.006
It came out of my heart, as they all do.

09:01.306 --> 09:03.869
I mean, I know.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.292
I know something about secrecy.

09:06.853 --> 09:08.075
I know something about deceit.

09:09.216 --> 09:14.443
I know what I've had to guard in my life, the things that happened to me in Vietnam that I never told anybody and never will.

09:16.225 --> 09:18.528
I've known what it can do to relationships.

09:19.028 --> 09:26.197
I consider the book a love story, basically, about what deceit will do to a human relationship.

09:26.217 --> 09:26.798
It will kill it.

09:28.229 --> 09:42.130
And at the same time, I also feel that there are times in life when you feel so trapped and we all wake up in the middle of the night thinking, man, I wish I never hadn't said that at that cocktail party.

09:42.150 --> 09:42.951
I wish I hadn't done that.

09:43.171 --> 09:45.615
I hope nobody remembers that or finds that out.

09:46.977 --> 09:51.183
Here's a guy that was part of something that was massive for Yale.

09:53.146 --> 09:58.033
And then it occurred to me, I read a couple of books on it, and I worked in the Muay area as a soldier.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.202
You were there about a year afterwards.

10:00.222 --> 10:01.143
About a year afterwards.

10:01.223 --> 10:04.366
I knew the area and knew what I could write about it with.

10:05.368 --> 10:05.868
In my heart.

10:09.873 --> 10:11.915
What was it like a year afterwards?

10:11.935 --> 10:14.839
Was it the Golden Bone or were the demons there?

10:15.639 --> 10:16.460
Carrier than shit.

10:17.061 --> 10:18.082
Scariest place I've ever been.

10:18.102 --> 10:18.643
We hated it.

10:18.683 --> 10:19.624
We were terrified.

10:21.306 --> 10:23.929
You knew what had gone down when you were there?

10:24.009 --> 10:24.730
Found out about it.

10:25.570 --> 10:53.367
nine months into my tour, but first we were just scared of the place, booby-trapped, and gai-hoos, and legs, and people that hated us, and much more than any other part of Vietnam, and when we were told we were going into Pinkville, into the Murai area, we were just terrified, but about nine months into my tour, we found out, hit the papers, and my unit covered the, when we did this security, when the Pierce Commission people came over, you know, we

10:54.224 --> 10:56.027
swept it for the mines and so on.

10:57.869 --> 11:03.538
But it occurred to me that those guys who did that are still among us.

11:04.339 --> 11:05.180
Do their wives know?

11:06.562 --> 11:06.963
How much?

11:08.165 --> 11:09.026
We don't even know their names.

11:09.266 --> 11:10.308
We know maybe five names.

11:11.690 --> 11:12.972
Cali, Medina maybe.

11:13.953 --> 11:15.876
A couple people mightn't remember Medlo's name.

11:16.136 --> 11:18.380
Beyond that, they're all forgotten.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.882
They're all out there in the world.

11:19.902 --> 11:24.028
I was a big grand carrier right here, by the way, about the same time you were there.

11:24.633 --> 11:25.354
Well, you know what I mean.

11:25.414 --> 11:26.676
Those guys are out there.

11:26.716 --> 11:27.737
They're living their lives.

11:28.779 --> 11:32.183
Callie's running a jewelry store down there.

11:32.203 --> 11:38.271
I mean, even with my profound interest in it, I couldn't.

11:38.472 --> 11:39.012
I couldn't either.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.174
So I did the research.

11:40.214 --> 11:41.876
I couldn't.

11:41.916 --> 11:43.879
What do their lives know?

11:44.780 --> 11:45.741
How do they live their lives?

11:45.801 --> 11:47.704
How do they go from day to day?

11:49.034 --> 11:55.419
I know you have put your character in a real situation with Callie.

11:55.439 --> 11:57.061
You've got Rusty Callie there.

11:57.121 --> 11:57.421
I do.

11:57.461 --> 12:02.385
That's the first time that I did that.

12:02.465 --> 12:04.867
Usually I've shied away from it.

12:04.887 --> 12:08.651
I've tried to make up my own Vietnam out of my head and my own imagination.

12:08.671 --> 12:11.153
That's one of the challenges.

12:11.193 --> 12:16.337
That's one of the reasons I stopped for a while thinking, do I have the guts to do this?

12:18.039 --> 12:18.619
And...

12:19.544 --> 12:23.269
Even though he may be an incarnation of evil, perhaps.

12:24.871 --> 12:25.572
Yeah.

12:25.772 --> 12:36.227
But did you still feel, despite that, that you had a responsibility to be fair to his character, considering the fact that he's a real person?

12:36.247 --> 12:39.451
It's like asking when do you have a responsibility to be fair to his character.

12:39.771 --> 12:41.634
I mean, in a way, yeah.

12:41.914 --> 12:43.276
And I tried to be that.

12:44.438 --> 12:46.000
I understand what happened there.

12:47.482 --> 12:48.283
You do?

12:48.303 --> 12:48.403
Sure.

12:49.666 --> 12:52.509
I mean, there's a footnote where I talk about I went through the same damn thing.

12:54.591 --> 12:55.412
Couldn't find the enemy.

12:55.773 --> 12:56.754
They could always find us.

12:56.854 --> 12:57.735
You didn't trust anybody.

12:58.756 --> 13:01.399
You get this frustration builds up.

13:01.419 --> 13:02.480
It turns into rage.

13:03.721 --> 13:05.082
It turns into pistol whipping.

13:05.423 --> 13:11.069
It turns into burning down villages and calling an airstrike if you take a sniper around.

13:12.250 --> 13:18.677
At the same time, even though I understand it, you can't justify it.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.265
still outraged by it.

13:20.305 --> 13:25.933
And the fact that only one person spent a total of, you know, five months in real jail.

13:26.293 --> 13:28.617
One person, five months in jail, 500 people dying.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.100
Enraged.

13:31.361 --> 13:35.787
Yeah, I mean, segments of society were saying, free Cali.

13:36.989 --> 13:39.833
And all these guys, some of them admitted to multiple murders.

13:40.374 --> 13:43.799
You know, in the court of the testimony, nothing happened.

13:43.819 --> 13:45.821
They were, charges were quietly dropped.

13:47.143 --> 13:47.584
They were

13:48.948 --> 13:50.850
Some weren't even prosecuted.

13:50.870 --> 13:53.893
Yeah, that's right.

13:54.674 --> 13:59.339
Cy Hirsch doesn't do it and right now he doesn't write his letter.

14:00.280 --> 14:00.620
You know?

14:02.302 --> 14:07.787
And the last thing is that I felt a little outraged that most of us in Vietnam behaved.

14:09.469 --> 14:11.110
There was a line we didn't cross.

14:12.292 --> 14:17.537
There was a line between frustration and murder.

14:18.277 --> 14:19.719
Well, good and evil, too, I think.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.480
And good and evil.

14:20.580 --> 14:21.381
Yeah.

14:21.401 --> 14:21.982
Good and evil.

14:22.002 --> 14:23.604
It's a battle, isn't it?

14:24.004 --> 14:24.244
Yeah.

14:24.725 --> 14:26.127
It's a morality play.

14:27.188 --> 14:27.348
Yeah.

14:27.368 --> 14:27.488
Yeah.

14:27.509 --> 14:35.979
Well, I tried, Dr. Merrill, I tried in the book to say just kind of why it happened, but it's still evil.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.881
And there's something about those lines about the sunlight.

14:38.642 --> 14:39.383
I believe in that.

14:39.644 --> 14:40.725
Do that again.

14:40.745 --> 14:41.166
Say that again.

14:41.206 --> 14:47.153
Some of the lines about the sunlight and the pink sunlight and the sunlight all throughout the new life, actually, when this is happening, that

14:48.719 --> 14:57.431
We have the whole sun across the universe.

14:57.751 --> 15:04.500
Now and then, evil seems to come like oil through us.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.661
You can smell it and taste it.

15:05.701 --> 15:07.364
I was there enough to know when it was there.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.409
Little coincidences of nature.

15:11.429 --> 15:13.892
What it said one day and what it said the next day.

15:13.952 --> 15:15.975
Then this guy gets killed.

15:17.626 --> 15:23.431
A couple of ambiguous orders are given, and then suddenly you're surrounded by potential for evil.

15:26.314 --> 15:28.176
In a way, I don't want to emphasize this too much.

15:28.196 --> 15:45.152
I think it's mostly a book about, I mean, it's obviously a book about deceit, hiding things, and terror of telling the truth, because you're so terrified of being left.

15:46.567 --> 16:03.071
Being driven to write about these issues on the one hand, and then your responsibilities as a writer to engage and to hold the reader, to perform, to write a story.

16:03.632 --> 16:10.162
How do you, again, that's the risk, I guess, by offering a mystery without a solution.

16:11.023 --> 16:12.565
There is a solution, in a way.

16:12.645 --> 16:14.548
The solution is, we all know.

16:15.777 --> 16:18.761
which is the solution that life gives us almost all the time.

16:20.303 --> 16:21.104
I'll tell you a couple things.

16:21.244 --> 16:31.238
One is that every time you read a real mystery, you know, so-called real mystery, as soon as you find out who'd done it, you know, Jack did it to Jane with a candlestick in the conservatory.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.560
As soon as you read that, you forget.

16:33.241 --> 16:36.385
You can't remember a damn thing about the rest of the book a week later, a day later.

16:37.867 --> 16:42.974
And what we do remember is what we can't quite explain.

16:43.094 --> 16:45.177
We're on a train on a jump under that train.

16:46.372 --> 16:52.600
We know a lot of things we do know, but she's gone.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.482
She can't tell us.

16:54.603 --> 16:56.746
She can't say, I did it for the next reason alone.

16:56.826 --> 16:58.969
It's not that simple.

16:59.029 --> 17:00.831
Lizzie Borden kept shut and mouth shut.

17:02.734 --> 17:03.836
What happens with a little big oil?

17:05.578 --> 17:06.379
They're all gone.

17:06.419 --> 17:07.040
We're not going to know.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.322
That's why we still care about it.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.444
We all knew if a few guys survived, we'd know.

17:10.565 --> 17:11.406
Same with the Alamo.

17:13.208 --> 17:16.092
It's that absence of what keeps us

17:18.248 --> 17:20.192
That's why we have religions.

17:20.212 --> 17:20.773
We don't know it.

17:21.454 --> 17:25.042
What's their last thought?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.206
Yeah.

17:27.226 --> 17:28.068
Yeah.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.272
How long did they live at all?

17:30.893 --> 17:31.755
A while, huh?

17:31.775 --> 17:33.138
I don't know.

17:33.559 --> 17:33.899
They did?

17:34.380 --> 17:35.001
I had no idea.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.206
Yeah.

17:37.226 --> 17:37.827
But no.

17:38.195 --> 17:44.043
Well, they, no, I mean, but their resentment is that they were trying to get things done.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.946
Is that right?

17:46.146 --> 17:52.355
And I think even the other woman, but the guys, you know, they're professional pilots.

17:52.816 --> 17:56.161
They were doing what they could do.

17:56.181 --> 17:59.946
Because that's just what they're training for.

18:00.106 --> 18:02.430
That's a good example, I think.

18:02.770 --> 18:05.434
Those are the things that are engaged.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.259
That's the fascination of Lincoln.

18:08.720 --> 18:15.489
I remember as a kid reading a book by Jim Bishop called The Gay Lincoln Dyer.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.532
You did a Titanic, too.

18:17.552 --> 18:19.275
Yeah, you did a lot of books on it.

18:19.395 --> 18:26.164
One day, and I remember reading that book, and throughout the book there was a sense of, you know, mystery.

18:27.206 --> 18:33.835
Because Bruce was shy, and he could never say anything about how it developed.

18:34.844 --> 18:36.045
Was anybody else involved?

18:36.065 --> 18:40.189
There were theories that Stanton, the Secretary of War was involved, all kinds of weird theories.

18:43.253 --> 18:48.858
Ever since reading that book, I think, and I've always been fascinated by what, I'll never know.

18:49.679 --> 18:54.524
Then you grow up and you start getting into human relationships.

18:55.405 --> 18:57.827
Then those mysteries get really important in life.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.252
People really love us and how much.

19:03.211 --> 19:04.733
And they tell us they do.

19:05.635 --> 19:06.195
Do you believe them?

19:09.100 --> 19:14.368
Why do you believe them?

19:14.408 --> 19:21.138
What are they really thinking?

19:21.719 --> 19:24.463
No, I didn't.

19:24.904 --> 19:26.025
I kept scraps of letters.

19:27.848 --> 19:28.950
Yeah, I had scraps of letters.

19:29.971 --> 19:31.193
Just thought I didn't go into that.

19:31.949 --> 19:33.170
But not much, no.

19:33.891 --> 19:47.224
But I was leading to, I guess I've also suggested that you wouldn't, or you've said that you would not be a writer, had it not been to be a Vietman.

19:47.665 --> 19:48.426
That's true.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.550
And yet, again, it seems almost pedagogical.

19:52.590 --> 19:56.494
I guess you say you don't draw from your own personal experience.

19:56.634 --> 19:56.734
Yeah.

19:56.754 --> 19:57.755
Because you run out of them.

19:57.775 --> 19:59.897
I mean, you run out of them fast in your first book.

20:00.552 --> 20:01.974
Everything that happened to me, I wrote about.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.037
I mean, every damn thing.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.742
If I can remember, I put my very first Mr. War memoirs, a non-fiction book.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.206
And then you get to go deeper.

20:10.226 --> 20:10.867
It's more fun.

20:12.129 --> 20:18.418
You know, you get to write about not what happened, but what could have happened or what should have happened.

20:19.059 --> 20:20.100
Hence, I wrote Cacciato.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.883
You know, I could have walked away from that damn war.

20:21.963 --> 20:22.724
But what stopped me?

20:22.804 --> 20:23.345
I had a rifle.

20:23.365 --> 20:25.648
I had food.

20:26.430 --> 20:28.112
I could get food with a rifle.

20:28.615 --> 20:32.699
It was a hell of a lot less dangerous than staying in Vietnam.

20:32.719 --> 20:33.660
And we used to talk about it.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.781
That's what could have happened.

20:35.221 --> 20:36.062
Maybe should have happened.

20:36.082 --> 20:37.163
I hated the war so much.

20:38.404 --> 20:49.695
Best fiction, I think, is almost always a mixture of the real world with going beyond it into the could ofs and the should ofs and the maybes.

20:52.438 --> 20:55.621
Any book I can think of as any good is that way.

20:56.141 --> 20:57.002
Hamlet.

20:58.062 --> 21:08.833
You start with reality, a real prince, and you take it into another to the imaginative plane, which is why I write fiction.

21:12.356 --> 21:19.424
Are you driven by these stories, and do they come up?

21:19.444 --> 21:21.326
Totally what you described with the Earth at night.

21:21.486 --> 21:21.586
Yeah.

21:21.606 --> 21:22.387
I think three times.

21:23.428 --> 21:24.709
It's actually just set in tight.

21:25.049 --> 21:25.990
Driven by the Earth.

21:26.070 --> 21:27.272
It's just the prose, though.

21:27.532 --> 21:27.732
Yeah.

21:28.336 --> 21:29.277
I mean, things change.

21:29.337 --> 21:30.178
I am driven.

21:30.519 --> 21:33.002
Actually, I'll open an example of the book that won the National Book Award.

21:33.603 --> 21:38.049
I spent six months rewriting the damn thing about, oh, I don't know, three years ago.

21:38.990 --> 21:42.174
Sitting in the galleries, you know, looking into the next paperback edition.

21:43.175 --> 21:44.517
And you find little writing things.

21:44.577 --> 21:46.439
I mean, a lot of them.

21:46.460 --> 21:54.590
And, you know, I saw that guy who teaches a book called me up and said, the student had one edition, he had the other edition.

21:55.111 --> 21:57.634
And they were saying, hey, this isn't the same.

21:58.525 --> 22:04.851
And not many novelists do this, you know, there's a body of opinion across the country.

22:06.933 --> 22:08.935
I know, I asked Bill Kennedy that question.

22:08.995 --> 22:12.639
He issued his first book, The Interrupted, I think.

22:13.980 --> 22:18.465
I said, when they were doing this, were you tempted at all to go in and release it?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.246
No, finished work is finished work.

22:20.487 --> 22:22.589
That's one point in my life.

22:22.609 --> 22:26.152
Henry James, however, when he was four, he wanted to go with it.

22:26.252 --> 22:27.013
Two things.

22:27.365 --> 22:32.572
That's what I quote last night by a poet named Donald Justice who had reissued his poems in a collected version.

22:32.612 --> 22:36.518
He said, I just don't hold with those that you shouldn't play with these things.

22:36.578 --> 22:42.245
That when you find mistakes, you're trying to leave a gift to the world ultimately that's beautiful.

22:42.746 --> 22:45.249
If you find a way to make it more beautiful, you should sure as hell do it.

22:45.310 --> 22:49.776
So you're telling me when that new edition of Cratchito, that book's going to be different?

22:50.276 --> 22:50.837
It's already out.

22:51.678 --> 22:52.700
It's been out for three years.

22:53.901 --> 22:54.402
Four years.

22:55.276 --> 23:01.844
Just flip them in, and that's the book that's going to last, and the one that lasts when you do.

23:03.165 --> 23:06.990
And I read so much better.

23:07.010 --> 23:16.862
I mean, little stupid things I do, like high comma, I mean, that's not the word, but you say something, comma, you smile, small h. Well, you don't smile words.

23:17.703 --> 23:18.364
It's a thing you learn.

23:18.384 --> 23:23.730
You should go, you know, whatever the dialogue is, period, quotation mark, capital H, you smile, period.

23:24.115 --> 23:25.297
You don't smile.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.680
You didn't laugh at the woods.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.321
Yeah.

23:29.423 --> 23:31.646
But even there, yeah, that would be that you could do.

23:32.687 --> 23:33.048
Maybe.

23:33.949 --> 23:36.372
But there are big things, too.

23:36.392 --> 23:38.856
You know, the cartoonish parts of Cacciato I didn't like.

23:39.978 --> 23:40.819
I went overboard.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.684
And it's a hell of a lot better book now.

23:45.866 --> 23:48.109
But you're 20 years older, I think.

23:48.209 --> 23:48.409
Almost.

23:48.430 --> 23:49.231
20 years wiser.

23:49.872 --> 23:52.736
There's a lot of mistakes you make when you're a kid that I wouldn't make now.

23:53.096 --> 23:53.717
I'll tell you that.

23:54.423 --> 23:55.684
I wouldn't be doing, you know.

23:55.764 --> 24:01.309
So the book that won the National Hook Award is different from the one that they authorized.

24:01.329 --> 24:01.689
You bet.

24:01.729 --> 24:02.730
It's a lot better book.

24:03.031 --> 24:04.612
Same with things I carried right now.

24:04.792 --> 24:06.474
Having finished this book, I'm going through it.

24:06.534 --> 24:08.956
And there's a book that was a huge success.

24:08.976 --> 24:09.837
It's taught everywhere.

24:10.838 --> 24:13.580
But I found, I mean, I should have brought a copy to show you.

24:13.940 --> 24:15.382
Yeah.

24:15.402 --> 24:17.383
I mean, paragraphs crossed out.

24:18.384 --> 24:19.325
Things I've got to add.

24:19.725 --> 24:20.786
Lots of changes.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.708
And it'll end up being enough.

24:22.992 --> 24:25.195
You know, I'll flip the changes into the newspaper back.

24:25.555 --> 24:29.341
Do you realize that the first editions of your book make a book?

24:29.461 --> 24:29.881
Good?

24:30.182 --> 24:31.023
Good.

24:31.183 --> 24:33.987
You know, that's good.

24:35.289 --> 24:36.450
I could care less about that.

24:36.630 --> 24:38.773
I care about leaving something beautiful.

24:38.873 --> 24:39.214
I know.

24:40.536 --> 24:45.202
But I do believe in books as being gifts to the world.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.506
And hopefully a hundred years from now, somebody at the library will pick it up.

24:48.526 --> 24:52.071
And if you leave a prettier book and a better-made book,

24:53.114 --> 24:56.961
I think you've answered the question that we asked you to get anyway.

24:57.481 --> 25:02.249
Do you view your writing as a form of exorcism?

25:02.269 --> 25:03.191
But I guess not.

25:03.552 --> 25:05.715
No.

25:06.076 --> 25:08.740
Maybe this book a little bit.

25:08.760 --> 25:09.682
This book a little bit.

25:10.543 --> 25:11.225
More than a little.

25:11.245 --> 25:13.268
This book a lot to be direct.

25:14.270 --> 25:15.071
Other books, no.

25:16.814 --> 25:19.138
But this book about

25:22.173 --> 25:41.761
holding things within and how it can rot and corrupt love and how the absence of openness can be so corrosive to the human spirit but also to whatever exists between a couple of people.

25:43.784 --> 25:50.273
How the pain of discovery of things you didn't know can really cripple a relationship.

25:51.653 --> 25:56.320
And that's what I'm going through now, trying to repair our relationship.

25:58.303 --> 26:11.802
And the things I have never told anybody, including my psychiatrist, about Vietnam, that I can't.

26:12.723 --> 26:14.666
You have a psychiatrist?

26:15.808 --> 26:15.988
Yeah.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.090
You have a psychiatrist?

26:17.791 --> 26:18.512
Yeah, yeah.

26:18.532 --> 26:19.813
Vietnam-related things?

26:19.934 --> 26:21.576
Partly, yeah.

26:23.243 --> 26:47.458
I'm not, I'm not, I don't think I suffer from any disease of any sort, but I do think that I'm, it's like if your dad died from cancer and he never told you he loved you, it's just going to stick with you, you know?

26:47.599 --> 26:51.985
Helps to sort of admit it, and that's kind of what psychiatry is about, sort of admitting things.

26:52.336 --> 27:05.047
They're very hard to admit to yourself that maybe you try to block it out and pretend he loved you and pretend he told you and there's some of that in this book.

27:05.067 --> 27:13.714
So in a lot of ways, yeah, this is the first book I ever wrote where I feel that kind of opened my heart up.

27:16.376 --> 27:21.921
And things that carry different, I mean, I have reasons I know autobiography, kind of, even though it's not difficult.

27:22.525 --> 27:28.197
That's awful right now.

27:29.239 --> 27:30.882
There's a Vietnam gentleman right there now.

27:30.902 --> 27:33.929
Senator Kerry, there's a politician who was in Vietnam.

27:34.530 --> 27:37.055
I thought of him when I was reading your book.

27:37.296 --> 27:43.268
Another guy, he was on track.

27:43.990 --> 28:07.666
You did say that there is a bit of exorcism in this book for you, and I wonder if that may, I'm not asking whether you're exercising anything back at home in your home state, but it is interesting for what you've done, perhaps, that the novel is that the state really grew up.

28:07.746 --> 28:10.350
Well, I mean, I know there's some practical reasons.

28:10.370 --> 28:11.652
I mean, the Lake of the Woods is a

28:13.336 --> 28:15.859
I've never been there, but I know northern Minnesota.

28:15.879 --> 28:18.703
I've been there a lot, you know, as a child and on vacation.

28:19.464 --> 28:24.371
It's a brutal, icy place where you can get lost physically.

28:25.492 --> 28:29.778
Well, first part of the book is an adventure story about the woman who's missing, trying to find her, you know.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.662
It's a place where you can physically have it happen.

28:34.244 --> 28:43.056
Another thing is that at my church there's a lost soul and it goes off and ends up in the verge of madness at the end.

28:44.116 --> 28:46.179
sailing off into the unknown.

28:49.303 --> 28:52.707
It's just kind of how I feel personally.

28:54.329 --> 28:59.616
There is no surprise then here for the leader, is there?

28:59.636 --> 29:00.457
Well, there's a surprise.

29:01.058 --> 29:01.679
There's a surprise.

29:01.779 --> 29:05.323
Some of the leaders are going to be surprised if they didn't find out what happened to her.

29:07.306 --> 29:12.132
But I mean... You know what I mean there?

29:12.365 --> 29:13.406
I'm being ironical.

29:13.546 --> 29:15.128
I'm being ironical.

29:16.189 --> 29:22.735
But you know, I think that I've had enough letters now that I know some people said, thank God it was that way.

29:23.616 --> 29:26.859
And I've had other letters saying, gee, how could you do that to me?

29:28.541 --> 29:35.768
And the answer is you just have to write the best book you can write and let the world, let 100 years from now, all these issues will be solved.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.750
Your book isn't read 100 years from now.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.071
It tells you something.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.633
If it is, that tells you something.

29:41.137 --> 29:44.982
but nothing contemporaneous is really going to mean a whole lot.

29:45.062 --> 29:49.347
Do you feel that you're writing for posterity?

29:49.768 --> 29:50.048
Yeah.

29:50.068 --> 29:53.092
For readers as yet unblocking?

29:53.532 --> 30:00.741
Yeah, I feel like I'm writing for the world, and the world isn't just a very little.

30:01.242 --> 30:10.333
I'm writing for a 19-year-old kid who will go into a library in downtown Minneapolis someday, and

30:11.123 --> 30:38.481
pick the book up and start reading a few pages and decide to check it out and I'm writing for a woman in Sioux City who does the same thing goes in a book and looking for a book in a library and that book is there and you can tell by how even in my lifetime the books that have lasted are

30:38.984 --> 30:45.533
I'm ready to hang it up.

30:46.714 --> 31:08.704
And I don't want you to, I'm not asking for personal matters, but I mean, I'm just,

31:09.427 --> 31:13.913
Tim O'Brien with outside concerns talking about Tim O'Brien.

31:13.954 --> 31:22.606
Tim O'Brien was a bit in... This book, whatever the reviews are, is the best book that I can write.

31:22.626 --> 31:23.688
I can't write a better book.

31:23.848 --> 31:26.672
It's like Michael Jordan did.

31:29.336 --> 31:30.437
He took a lot of shit for it.

31:31.539 --> 31:33.241
But he had to do it.

31:33.261 --> 31:34.123
I don't like that.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.805
I mean, Ted Williams went through the whole list.

31:35.988 --> 31:47.801
You do it for a reason.

31:47.821 --> 31:50.044
You do it when you think you've done the best you can do.

31:50.084 --> 32:04.240
And you do it also because once you've reached a point where you feel like you've fulfilled your reason for doing a thing, and ultimately the reason I've written is to tell the truth, be honest about the world,

32:05.080 --> 32:09.727
And once you run out of things to be truthful about, there are interesting things to say.

32:11.009 --> 32:14.273
I'd rather, you know, sharpen up my golf game.

32:15.495 --> 32:17.258
Spend some more time in Minnesota with my parents.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.644
Yeah, my brother lives in the Twin Cities.

32:21.664 --> 32:23.447
Can you give me some names, by the way?

32:23.707 --> 32:24.949
Yeah, sure.

32:24.969 --> 32:26.852
They live in a town called Worthington.

32:27.292 --> 32:29.796
W-O-R-T-H-I-N-G-A-T-O-N.

32:29.936 --> 32:30.917
Worthington.

32:31.338 --> 32:31.999
Bill and Ava.

32:32.688 --> 32:36.272
My brother's name is AVA.

32:36.293 --> 32:38.015
And Greg is my G-R-E-G.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.018
My brother lives in Egan.

32:41.679 --> 32:42.500
In Egan, Minnesota.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.603
It's a suburb of E-G-A-N.

32:44.703 --> 32:46.565
Suburb of Minneapolis.

32:46.605 --> 32:48.408
You're saving me a lot of time.

32:48.448 --> 32:48.848
I know.

32:49.709 --> 32:49.990
I know.

32:50.230 --> 32:51.131
I was a reporter myself.

32:51.171 --> 32:52.212
I know how this works.

32:53.494 --> 32:54.295
I know how it works.

32:54.315 --> 32:58.941
Give me some of the steps you know.

32:58.961 --> 33:00.883
You were born in Minneapolis, by the way?

33:01.184 --> 33:02.205
Born in Austin.

33:02.962 --> 33:04.905
Austin, like Austin, Texas.

33:04.925 --> 33:08.971
I moved to Worthington when I was very young.

33:08.991 --> 33:10.293
Worthington is my hometown.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.520
I don't get back there as much as I want.

33:14.540 --> 33:16.143
I don't get to see my brother as much.

33:16.163 --> 33:17.104
My mom and dad.

33:17.144 --> 33:19.087
My sister just had a mastectomy.

33:19.688 --> 33:23.374
I got to start spending time with that stuff.

33:24.115 --> 33:25.617
I've been so obsessive about writing.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.323
You've been so obsessive about writing.

33:30.012 --> 33:32.295
That's what I mean.

33:33.016 --> 33:34.899
I want to move away.

33:34.919 --> 33:39.626
I don't want to change my mind.

33:39.646 --> 33:48.979
Do you mind if I move the quotes around, by the way?

33:49.039 --> 33:49.700
Are you kidding?

33:49.740 --> 33:50.421
Of course not.

33:50.461 --> 33:50.781
Hell no.

33:50.801 --> 33:55.648
I got an appointment with my girlfriend.

33:56.422 --> 33:58.744
and one o'clock and I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna be there.

33:58.924 --> 34:00.146
That's what I care about.

34:00.586 --> 34:02.628
I want my, yeah, we'll do that.

34:04.290 --> 34:11.036
I get nervous here.

34:11.737 --> 34:15.421
I did Jim Lee Burke yesterday and I brought him with me in Boston.

34:16.001 --> 34:19.665
He's a nice guy.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.406
He's a good writer, I thought.

34:22.107 --> 34:23.549
I think.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.091
Yeah.

34:26.594 --> 34:28.417
Look, this is what's happening with my wife, you know?

34:28.497 --> 34:31.881
I've lost somebody.

34:31.901 --> 34:35.406
I don't know where she is emotionally and where I'll ever find her again.

34:35.426 --> 34:36.628
Is this for the record now?

34:36.908 --> 34:37.750
Yeah.

34:37.770 --> 34:39.612
I don't know what's going to happen to her.

34:39.632 --> 34:40.533
Will I ever find her again?

34:40.554 --> 34:42.096
I don't know.

34:42.116 --> 34:43.097
Are you talking about your wife?

34:43.438 --> 34:44.799
No, talking about my girlfriend.

34:44.819 --> 34:45.581
I'm getting divorced.

34:45.601 --> 34:49.025
I'm in the process of a divorce whose name is Kate.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.070
It's coincidentally.

34:52.931 --> 34:53.091
Yeah.

34:54.742 --> 34:55.803
That's not really coincidence.

34:55.823 --> 34:56.985
My sister's name is Kathy.

34:57.005 --> 34:58.467
I just chose that because of that.

34:59.768 --> 35:08.259
But there's a reason that there's no answers, because I don't know what the answers are going to be.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.743
I don't know what my own culpability is.

35:10.763 --> 35:15.949
I know some things I'm responsible for, the same way John Wade does.

35:16.029 --> 35:19.153
I also know that I'm with Wade at the end of that book.

35:19.193 --> 35:20.695
I'm skimming off into the unknown.

35:22.818 --> 35:24.360
I don't know what happened, really.

35:26.703 --> 35:44.931
And I want to try to find out the same way he does, and yet maybe I didn't know that murder hypothesis, that boiling, that kind of really hideous scene, that there's a thing called killing logs, and I might have done that.

35:47.775 --> 35:48.937
And those things come out of your life.

35:50.399 --> 35:54.465
Let's talk about a couple of images.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.358
Can I tell you, I just finished writing about Prospero.

35:58.299 --> 36:00.901
We talk about Shakespeare leading him.

36:00.941 --> 36:02.843
He left with the Tempest.

36:03.084 --> 36:05.166
He came back and did a couple of collaborations.

36:05.186 --> 36:19.821
I mean, I think, by far, one of the great, great plays where he left for the stage and Prospero walks out and says, I was a prisoner from crime with pardon me with your indulgence.

36:19.841 --> 36:20.742
You set me free.

36:21.002 --> 36:22.904
Well, you have a beautiful line.

36:23.085 --> 36:24.486
It's better than that, too.

36:24.938 --> 36:28.741
I just watched a version of that with Ephraim Zimbalist Jr.

36:29.002 --> 36:29.622
playing Cospero.

36:29.642 --> 36:30.763
Can you imagine how bad that was?

36:30.783 --> 36:31.544
But it was a great play.

36:31.604 --> 36:33.045
The greatest play ever written, I think.

36:33.366 --> 36:35.688
But he left the stage with that play.

36:35.748 --> 36:43.015
And Chris Crossborough, and I write about this in my book, he is the signature character for Shakespeare.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.496
It's just pertinent to you.

36:44.616 --> 36:45.157
Yeah, it sure is.

36:45.477 --> 36:50.622
For Shakespeare, you see, the creative process was magic.

36:50.922 --> 36:54.405
It was a process that, as he says and as you like it,

36:54.672 --> 36:57.536
the writer's eye in the fire.

36:57.556 --> 37:05.928
And as imagination bodies forth, the forms of things unknown, the poet can... What does he do?

37:05.948 --> 37:07.570
He takes... I'm half asleep right there.

37:08.772 --> 37:10.134
You got him back down pretty damn well.

37:10.174 --> 37:14.540
There's a daughter, by the way.

37:14.560 --> 37:14.720
Okay.

37:14.740 --> 37:15.281
So it's magic.

37:15.301 --> 37:22.992
It's a process of taking... And as imagination bodies forth, the forms of things unknown, the poet's pen takes...

37:23.410 --> 37:50.869
but it turns in here it gives it gives every nothing a local application anyway but it is the same effort i try it it's magic and prospero of course is a magician is a magician i just read a book like francis yates about these cults in the elizabeth world and there were two kinds of magicians there was really interesting

37:51.102 --> 37:53.764
and the good magician.

37:53.965 --> 37:57.488
He is thrown out of the palace, too.

37:57.988 --> 38:02.832
And he leaves, and he takes his daughter, he takes his wand, and he takes his books.

38:02.872 --> 38:10.659
His line was, my library was duking him large enough, because he doesn't pay attention to the affairs of the state.

38:10.839 --> 38:20.468
At the end, he breaks his wand, and he buries his wand and his books, many statues deep in the ground.

38:21.038 --> 38:24.522
I get the point though.

38:25.123 --> 38:26.044
I know where you're going.

38:27.145 --> 38:31.110
Do you want to pick up one?

38:31.871 --> 38:42.324
Yeah, they're good magicians and they're bad.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.066
Nobody else has done it.

38:44.386 --> 38:46.048
I've done a few and nobody else has even come close.

38:46.148 --> 38:47.370
Nobody else even gets it in a way.

38:48.211 --> 38:49.392
There's a reason people

38:50.165 --> 38:51.487
The reason magic fascinates.

38:51.527 --> 38:53.230
That's the mystery we were talking about.

38:53.290 --> 38:54.733
The desire for the supernatural.

38:54.753 --> 38:55.935
It goes beyond just magic.

38:55.955 --> 38:58.680
It goes to things like religion and belief in people.

38:59.561 --> 39:01.585
There's a desire to believe in miracles.

39:01.905 --> 39:03.208
A miracle will save me.

39:06.012 --> 39:10.901
People at Mirai that day, as they were getting shot down, must have been praying for God's intervention.

39:11.342 --> 39:15.008
Some magi coming out and putting an end to it.

39:17.924 --> 39:20.928
There's a line from the book about why Wade is a magician.

39:21.970 --> 39:27.498
What did it mean to take some sovereignty over the world and control the world that's beyond control?

39:27.558 --> 39:29.081
Yeah.

39:33.127 --> 39:41.339
Politicians, not just politicians, but public figures manipulating the world, and sometimes in good ways.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.944
Good magicians trying to make a city into a happier place.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.620
I think FBI was a good magician.

39:48.700 --> 39:49.400
Good magician.

39:49.741 --> 39:50.001
I think.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.162
I really believe.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.584
I think in some ways.

39:53.084 --> 39:54.926
He used a lot of mirrors and smoke.

39:54.946 --> 39:56.628
A lot of mirrors and smoke.

39:56.768 --> 40:01.193
I mean, Johnson, in some ways, tried to be a good magician.

40:01.393 --> 40:02.154
Yeah.

40:02.374 --> 40:14.948
And yet, it's also that business of ultimately, you know, we live in a world where natural magic isn't going to always work.

40:15.164 --> 40:30.708
Kathy Wade was hoping for a miracle, that a marriage would change, that he would change, that they could be open and loving and just have an ordinary little blue house in Victoria in Minneapolis, a child, and a miracle never happened for her.

40:32.050 --> 40:39.602
And he was capable of doing bad magic, manipulating the world, trying to, for good reason,

40:41.033 --> 40:46.598
But with bad results, with bad motives, I mean, bad means.

40:50.582 --> 40:58.089
There's a line, the book is probably the best, the most meaningful line to me, anyway.

40:59.450 --> 41:04.795
You know, something to the effect you have to look up, it's in a chapter called Chapter 3.

41:06.097 --> 41:10.821
It's a two-page chapter where it says, you know,

41:12.083 --> 41:13.665
You do bad things for love.

41:15.608 --> 41:20.075
And he did bad things for love and trying to manipulate and to hide.

41:23.901 --> 41:25.162
Remake himself.

41:26.064 --> 41:26.905
Remake history.

41:27.306 --> 41:28.127
Fool the world.

41:28.828 --> 41:29.769
Fool his own life.

41:31.752 --> 41:33.535
And he put these little elements together with that.

41:33.555 --> 41:35.678
There's a quote from Button Nixon.

41:36.923 --> 41:56.083
This might to me be one of the most evident, where a guy who left for David, who spoke out the Lonely Lady of San Clemente, and he says, maybe, it's a harsh thing to say, but maybe Nixon not only didn't tell the country about Watergate, maybe he never even told his own family, his own wife.

41:59.927 --> 42:03.330
Maybe he fell.

42:03.350 --> 42:04.892
And I can see why he wouldn't.

42:04.912 --> 42:06.053
You know, maybe, I mean,

42:06.623 --> 42:10.869
And knowing his personality was here.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.331
Other things come from Minnesota.

42:12.791 --> 42:16.396
I had dinner with Mondale one night by chance.

42:16.416 --> 42:18.359
I've never met him before or since.

42:18.379 --> 42:21.924
And he's at my alma mater, McAllister College in St.

42:22.184 --> 42:22.725
Paul.

42:22.745 --> 42:24.608
And he sat across the table from me.

42:24.628 --> 42:28.994
And I just asked him about how he felt after getting crushed, you know, by Reagan.

42:30.556 --> 42:33.019
I was writing the book.

42:33.590 --> 42:37.555
And I didn't use anything he told me about, but I used it psychologically.

42:37.696 --> 42:39.057
He said, I was crushed.

42:39.137 --> 42:39.919
I was crushed.

42:40.059 --> 42:43.704
I was, you know, and he retreated to the North.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.686
I think he went, I can't remember where he went exactly.

42:45.706 --> 42:46.628
I think he went to Canada.

42:46.648 --> 42:47.028
I'm not sure.

42:47.048 --> 42:47.749
He could check on it.

42:49.311 --> 42:51.054
He had to get away the same way away he did.

42:51.074 --> 42:52.115
I mean, he was crushed.

42:53.216 --> 42:56.221
And we tend to think of politicians, public figures.

42:56.321 --> 42:57.322
I think they had a prayer.

42:58.263 --> 42:58.403
Yeah.

42:58.544 --> 43:00.306
I mean, Mardale didn't.

43:00.573 --> 43:02.014
That's my question.

43:02.074 --> 43:03.216
He had a wire.

43:03.616 --> 43:05.117
Yeah.

43:05.137 --> 43:08.020
But I think Mondale... I mean, that guy had a wire.

43:08.200 --> 43:15.567
He had a wire until... But, you know, we think of these guys as beyond being crushed.

43:15.908 --> 43:16.868
They can't feel anything.

43:18.510 --> 43:21.933
And defeat and secrets coming out.

43:22.113 --> 43:25.216
Enough of forces come into combination simultaneously.

43:25.296 --> 43:30.141
I'm like, boy, that defeat can do horrid things to the soul.

43:31.792 --> 43:35.636
You know, real horrid things to your soul.

43:35.916 --> 43:39.820
And what happens in love, then it's really horrid.

43:39.840 --> 43:44.605
Did we get all the biographical stuff we need, by the way?

43:44.665 --> 43:46.967
Yeah, went to public schools.

43:46.987 --> 43:49.189
Went to public schools, Macalester College.

43:49.390 --> 43:50.130
Graduated in 68.

43:50.791 --> 43:52.292
Where did you major in?

43:52.312 --> 43:54.134
I was a poli-sci major.

43:54.194 --> 43:57.277
And then you had a full scholarship here.

43:57.297 --> 43:58.078
Yeah, yeah.

43:58.098 --> 43:58.539
Came here.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.921
And you were drafted when?

44:01.525 --> 44:02.607
Jackson is 68.

44:02.967 --> 44:04.830
Surgeon in Vietnam is 69 and 70.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.954
Yeah, my first cruise was 69.

44:06.974 --> 44:08.336
My second cruise was 70.

44:08.797 --> 44:10.079
I went in.

44:10.099 --> 44:11.782
I went to ACS.

44:11.802 --> 44:13.384
You took the extra birth, huh?

44:13.645 --> 44:14.747
I was 18.

44:14.767 --> 44:17.231
And I was on a carrier.

44:17.271 --> 44:18.352
You required an extra year?

44:19.474 --> 44:19.835
Three years.

44:20.175 --> 44:21.317
An extra three years?

44:21.478 --> 44:22.479
No, three years.

44:22.499 --> 44:23.321
Three in total.

44:23.341 --> 44:24.242
Oh, got ya.

44:24.745 --> 44:33.997
He had a company commander who claimed he didn't see any of these 500 bodies.

44:36.461 --> 44:37.482
He found not guilty.

44:37.843 --> 44:41.968
He was there.

44:44.411 --> 44:47.175
They traced his route to the village.

44:47.324 --> 44:49.007
There's a book called Four Hours in My Life.

44:49.047 --> 44:49.708
Take a look at it.

44:49.728 --> 44:53.113
It's a great book written by a couple of English guys who did a documentary.

44:53.373 --> 44:54.815
About a year or so ago?

44:55.516 --> 44:56.538
About a year.

44:56.558 --> 44:57.239
I have it.

44:57.259 --> 44:58.501
I have the shelf on me.

44:58.521 --> 45:01.906
I mean, you should use it.

45:01.926 --> 45:03.528
And all these other guys, I mean, Meadlow.

45:04.009 --> 45:04.690
Remember the testimony?

45:04.710 --> 45:12.602
There's a piece of evidence in that book where they talk about the babies, and they were about to execute a counterbalance maneuver.

45:13.263 --> 45:13.523
Unbelievable.

45:13.543 --> 45:14.325
I mean, unbelievable.

45:14.926 --> 45:16.588
Well, Kelly, I didn't discriminate, sir.

45:16.720 --> 45:17.741
Yeah, I didn't discriminate.

45:17.821 --> 45:20.164
They were all the enemy.

45:20.184 --> 45:22.727
A little two-year-old baby.

45:22.807 --> 45:23.428
That's the enemy.

45:24.449 --> 45:25.190
It's not just those.

45:25.230 --> 45:26.451
I mean, there's all these other guys.

45:26.732 --> 45:30.536
A guy named Donald Simpson.

45:30.556 --> 45:31.698
He was interviewed on TV.

45:32.719 --> 45:35.482
It was horrid to watch, and he felt horrid about it.

45:35.682 --> 45:44.753
But he said I was personally responsible for killing 25 people and cutting off ears, scalping them, shooting them.

45:45.914 --> 45:47.937
just while we're being prosecuted.

45:47.957 --> 45:48.898
It's horrid to watch him.

45:48.918 --> 45:50.160
It's like a total basket case.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.704
And I was shaking on TV and holding chills behind him.

45:52.764 --> 45:59.213
And one day his own son, I can't remember exactly how it happened, was killed outside.

45:59.233 --> 46:03.819
And he ran out and he looked at the sky and pulled up his kidneys on and said, this is God's revenge.

46:08.666 --> 46:10.589
You read about these people out there among us.

46:10.829 --> 46:13.073
And it wasn't just Cali.

46:15.035 --> 46:15.516
It wasn't just Cali.

46:16.137 --> 46:20.401
But I think that that was probably the worst atrocity of the war, though.

46:20.421 --> 46:22.163
Do you think that's so, or do you think there were worse ones?

46:23.605 --> 46:24.986
I don't think there were worse, no.

46:26.447 --> 46:28.690
I think that was one of the things people were trying to say at the time.

46:30.131 --> 46:31.112
I never saw anything like it.

46:31.172 --> 46:31.272
No.

46:32.213 --> 46:35.276
And I don't think... I don't either.

46:35.296 --> 46:36.357
No.

46:36.377 --> 46:37.158
But I will say this.

46:37.238 --> 46:42.023
America has a way of forgetting its errors.

46:42.043 --> 46:44.946
They don't fit into our grand national mythology.

46:45.938 --> 46:46.939
what we did to the Indians.

46:49.723 --> 46:51.626
What happened, we're there.

46:52.207 --> 47:03.864
Evil doesn't fit in, and we just pat our bath salts in the back, and think of America the White Knight, America the Lone Ranger, America's laser-guided weaponry beating up on Saddam and his legion of evil, devils.

47:04.725 --> 47:06.227
Yeah, still not.

47:07.829 --> 47:13.277
For some reason, we have a way of not fitting evil into our own history, and we've got to learn to do it.

47:14.139 --> 47:15.861
We're not gods.

47:16.043 --> 47:18.507
Did we answer the magic question satisfactorily?

47:18.747 --> 47:22.713
Is this something, by the way, that you were fascinated with as a kid?

47:22.773 --> 47:24.115
Totally.

47:24.155 --> 47:26.498
Yeah, I was a magician as a kid.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.242
That was my hobby.

47:29.482 --> 47:31.005
That was stuff alone in the basement.

47:31.025 --> 47:32.146
You went to the basement.

47:32.166 --> 47:35.651
Yeah, I was a lonely... Did your father give you a hard time about that?

47:35.771 --> 47:37.734
No, he didn't give me a hard time about that.

47:37.935 --> 47:40.478
My father was a good guy, and he got me into books.

47:40.498 --> 47:42.341
Oh, this guy's a good guy, too.

47:42.361 --> 47:43.543
In a lot of ways, yeah.

47:44.204 --> 47:44.464
And...

47:45.558 --> 47:49.043
But I was a lonely, chubby kid.

47:49.484 --> 47:50.525
You were chubby as well?

47:51.847 --> 47:52.648
Yeah.

47:52.668 --> 47:54.791
I didn't have a lot of friends.

47:54.811 --> 47:58.457
I was a reader.

47:58.917 --> 48:04.225
In Worthington, Minnesota, you know, you give a shit about books, you're not exactly the most popular person.

48:04.265 --> 48:13.438
So a lot of that loneliness and living alone and wanting to manipulate the world and make good things happen comes from my life.

48:14.752 --> 48:16.434
What's the gliding theme?

48:16.454 --> 48:17.896
Is that just something that came in?

48:17.916 --> 48:22.802
The theme that comes from a thing that happened to me in Vietnam that I can't talk about.

48:22.862 --> 48:24.525
Really?

48:24.545 --> 48:25.426
They hit one there.

48:25.446 --> 48:34.758
Just a stunted thing happened and my body went into a glide and partly I was full of rage.

48:35.659 --> 48:39.604
I had a guy dying and partly I was not myself anymore.

48:39.624 --> 48:41.907
I was a nerd person.

48:43.591 --> 48:44.873
Good magic, bad magic.

48:44.913 --> 48:46.134
Good magic, bad magic.

48:46.655 --> 48:47.717
Right.

48:47.737 --> 48:48.598
There is good magic.

48:48.758 --> 48:50.100
There's a thing called love.

48:50.220 --> 48:52.022
Love is a kind of magic, and it can be good, too.

48:55.407 --> 48:57.550
Ah.

48:57.610 --> 48:57.890
It is.

48:57.990 --> 49:00.033
I mean, the irony is so overwhelming.

49:00.053 --> 49:02.236
Isn't that they can make villages disappear?

49:02.917 --> 49:03.017
Yeah.

49:03.757 --> 49:10.526
That's one of the great Shakespearean themes is illusion and reality.

49:10.847 --> 49:14.011
That's what America did with Vietnam.

49:14.031 --> 49:17.316
We made Muay disappear.

49:17.436 --> 49:23.364
But of course he couldn't make the things that really matter appear.

49:23.925 --> 49:25.127
That's right.

49:25.407 --> 49:27.931
He can just temporarily make it racist from our consciousness.

49:27.951 --> 49:28.611
That's the way he did.

49:28.631 --> 49:32.136
He could forget it for 20 years and try to.

49:32.156 --> 49:33.358
Now and then those things will come back.

49:35.043 --> 49:39.048
And then, of course, the ultimate disappearance, which is just a little mystery.

49:39.108 --> 49:41.811
I mean, you look for the cruelest irony of love.

49:41.851 --> 49:42.452
That's that.

49:42.572 --> 49:52.043
When you suddenly wake up and the person you've been madly in love with, you've been doing all your tricks for, gone from your life and gone forever, and you don't know what happened.

49:53.805 --> 49:57.950
And if you ever get her back or... We all do that.

49:58.331 --> 50:02.255
When your dad dies or something, you know, where'd he go?

50:02.476 --> 50:03.717
What were his last thoughts?

50:05.215 --> 50:05.996
Do you really love me?

50:07.097 --> 50:10.161
What would you have said if I said I love you on the death side of those things?

50:10.181 --> 50:10.802
We'll never know.

50:12.164 --> 50:19.893
I think that your imagery and the writing on the combat scenes are still some of the most powerful.

50:19.993 --> 50:24.058
Whether you read the final version of the book, you're going to be astounded at the difference.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.202
You can't let it go, can you?

50:28.464 --> 50:30.246
This book, I've been working on it.

50:30.406 --> 50:33.450
Are you still working on it or is it healthy enough?

50:33.903 --> 50:35.565
Are you going to write with me the phone I just finished?

50:35.585 --> 50:35.946
This book?

50:35.966 --> 50:36.226
Yeah.

50:37.408 --> 50:41.573
I worked on it until five days ago, six days ago.

50:41.613 --> 50:45.738
That book is... They weren't too thrilled.

50:45.758 --> 50:50.545
They were a little... The copy editor is a great guy, but he was getting a little tired of me calling in changes.

50:50.585 --> 50:57.393
That's why I'm into the major papers.

50:57.453 --> 51:00.898
I made them... I insisted that they... I was so pissed, you know.

51:00.918 --> 51:02.560
Now, what were you pissed about?

51:03.350 --> 51:05.232
Well, you don't want a book to go out there until it's done.

51:05.272 --> 51:11.919
That book was reviewed on the basis of something that was done, like, four months ago, three months ago.

51:11.939 --> 51:12.459
It's not fair.

51:13.641 --> 51:14.201
And P.W.

51:14.281 --> 51:14.802
and so on.

51:14.822 --> 51:18.806
And book lists, I made sure they got the finished book.

51:19.307 --> 51:20.107
I made damn sure.

51:20.127 --> 51:23.191
I made a list of the big papers in the country in the important place.

51:23.471 --> 51:27.655
You can send the bound galley, but you're also going to send your final pages.

51:29.197 --> 51:31.399
It's not good to a writer when you're working that hard.

51:31.632 --> 51:35.276
to make a good block, not to have the de-block reviewed.

51:35.917 --> 51:37.178
And then they can make their minds up.

51:38.720 --> 51:42.304
It shouldn't be sent out.

51:42.344 --> 51:49.152
That thing was made for the convention, and it wasn't made for sending out to reviewers.

51:49.172 --> 51:53.877
It was a 3,000 question or whatever.

51:54.262 --> 51:59.468
I thought, my understanding was going to booksellers.

51:59.588 --> 52:03.333
I know.

52:05.055 --> 52:05.736
But you're learning.

52:06.417 --> 52:07.157
It's not Hosen's fault.

52:07.177 --> 52:08.779
I just didn't know what was going on.

52:09.340 --> 52:11.062
I mean, that was naive.

52:13.665 --> 52:18.591
I think when you read the book, you're going to quit.

52:18.711 --> 52:19.632
I think it is, too.

52:19.973 --> 52:23.577
And I think it's 100 years from now that everybody's going to say, that's why I want to quit writing.

52:23.810 --> 52:28.857
I know life is more important to me.

52:29.858 --> 52:35.666
I want to be happy for a change.

52:35.686 --> 52:36.667
You're still under 50.

52:37.669 --> 52:41.734
Obviously, Vietnam clearly is the event of our generation.

52:42.836 --> 52:47.482
You were debating going to Canada at one point.

52:48.904 --> 52:51.167
What's your feeling retrospectively on that now?

52:51.518 --> 52:52.319
I was a coward.

52:52.339 --> 52:54.342
I should have done what I thought was right.

52:54.582 --> 52:55.824
I'll always feel that way.

52:56.084 --> 52:59.388
I'll get a million letters and I'll always hang out.

52:59.408 --> 53:00.049
That's how I feel.

53:00.089 --> 53:02.172
If you think something's wrong, you shouldn't do it.

53:02.512 --> 53:06.618
So you think then that perhaps... Given what I believe, I should not have gone to that war.

53:06.758 --> 53:08.680
And you think that you shouldn't have been a writer then?

53:09.642 --> 53:10.443
Because you wouldn't have been.

53:11.104 --> 53:12.485
No, I think I should have been a writer.

53:12.505 --> 53:17.131
I mean, that's one of the reasons you become a writer is you do bad things.

53:17.151 --> 53:18.353
You live through tragedy.

53:19.210 --> 53:22.694
You live through your mistakes, and you've got to try to salvage something out of it.

53:23.355 --> 53:29.541
And part of what art is, I think, is salvage some beauty out of the horror.

53:31.163 --> 53:36.709
And I think they're painting Rannica, you know, that great, I mean, ugly event.

53:37.891 --> 53:39.512
But there's some, you rescue beauty.

53:40.934 --> 53:45.099
What Macbeth does, I mean, it rescues beauty out of horror.

53:46.981 --> 53:48.222
Yeah, yeah.

53:49.619 --> 54:04.213
That difference, that line, out, out, I mean, that has to do with a kind of purging of, that line is a beautiful line because it has to do with the human desire to rid itself of evil.

54:04.893 --> 54:10.979
You know that famous line, the word's only been used once in literature, the moltitudinous disease incarnadine.

54:11.439 --> 54:17.365
Like that washes his hands in the ocean, and instead of the green ocean turning his hands,

54:18.087 --> 54:22.394
That's what art does.

54:22.454 --> 54:39.960
I mean, I felt this, you know, this pink, I mean, this isn't just, it's just one of these,

54:40.210 --> 54:49.621
Was it called Peteville because of, I mean, is that just one of these cool... If you look at a map, a military map, it's shaded pink on the map, and it signified a built-up area.

54:49.641 --> 55:04.599
Yeah, but I mean, how appropriately... But the sunlight, I remember the sunlight in the morning, that pink, gorgeous, beautiful sunlight, and the most hideous things happening underneath the sunlight.

55:05.280 --> 55:08.243
You felt that the sunlight was somehow expecting it.

55:09.708 --> 55:17.876
It was, I'll never, I always thought it was called, I told somebody to explain to me, I thought it was called Pinkville because everything became pink.

55:17.896 --> 55:18.817
The soil's red.

55:19.217 --> 55:31.029
I mean, having gone, I just went back there in February and threw me a lie, and I was doing a piece of New York Times Magazine on it, and probably my final overture.

55:31.169 --> 55:33.031
I mean, you're serious about this.

55:33.051 --> 55:35.694
This is not, yeah.

55:35.714 --> 55:39.057
I mean, I'm not saying that maybe 15 years from now I won't,

55:39.205 --> 55:40.928
changed my mind the way Ross did.

55:40.968 --> 55:42.030
He may change his mind.

55:43.131 --> 55:54.890
But for now, I want to be happy and I want to get to know my family better and make my life good.

55:56.633 --> 55:58.576
Now you have no children, I gather.

56:00.499 --> 56:00.660
No.

56:00.960 --> 56:04.005
Can I call you at some point with any additional questions?

56:04.025 --> 56:04.967
Yep, absolutely.

56:04.987 --> 56:05.728
Tell me about that.

56:05.768 --> 56:06.529
I haven't showered.

56:07.100 --> 56:08.542
I don't know.

56:08.562 --> 56:15.673
Every place I go, I get them.

56:16.634 --> 56:24.847
I'm going to change that, though.

56:24.907 --> 56:26.710
That's one of the things I go on the tour.

56:26.730 --> 56:31.557
I've decided that I'm going to... I don't know.

56:31.577 --> 56:33.820
I just decided to make some big changes in my life.

56:34.021 --> 56:35.503
Some of them are small, some of them are big.

56:36.631 --> 56:39.754
I use it because it's like a trademark and because the people are used to it.

56:39.794 --> 56:41.637
If I'm not wearing it, they get pissed at me.

56:42.177 --> 56:42.437
Really?

56:42.517 --> 56:42.818
Yeah.

56:43.118 --> 56:44.500
They say, where's your baseball cap?

56:44.860 --> 56:46.121
Don't you have a picture of your baseball cap?

56:46.141 --> 56:47.103
This isn't going to look right.

56:47.123 --> 56:48.024
That's going to look like you.

56:49.265 --> 56:55.912
But I'm going to check that changing on October 1st when I, my birthday hits when I go on the old, hit the road, this tour.

56:57.514 --> 56:58.295
Yeah.

56:58.315 --> 56:59.416
A lot of other things I'm changing.

56:59.436 --> 57:01.699
I thought I got the patch finally to stop smoking.

57:02.600 --> 57:03.220
I'm going to do that.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.782
A lot of changes I'm going to be making.

57:05.200 --> 57:15.674
You know, it's just things I've written about.

57:16.895 --> 57:21.842
I want to just become a better person without paying attention to people.

57:22.943 --> 57:30.273
I've been so obsessed with writing for so many years, trying to write well, and it's hard for me to make sentences.

57:30.673 --> 57:33.537
Not at all.

57:35.170 --> 57:35.952
I'm tired of it.

57:37.315 --> 57:53.314
And that's why, you know, be a good person.
