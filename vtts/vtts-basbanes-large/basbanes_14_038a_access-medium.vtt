00:04.165 --> 00:10.754
It would be on C-SPAN 2 on Book TV this Saturday at 5 p.m.

00:10.774 --> 00:16.321
5 p.m., 9.45, and then 12.45.

00:18.223 --> 00:19.065
This Saturday.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.293
What time again?

00:25.313 --> 00:25.653
5.

00:25.673 --> 00:26.654
Before I get to that tape.

00:27.175 --> 00:27.736
5 p.m.

00:28.597 --> 00:31.641
9.45, and 12.45.

00:33.646 --> 00:35.307
It was about an hour-long show.

00:35.648 --> 00:36.068
Excellent.

00:38.350 --> 00:46.077
But no, I mean, I think, I feel good about the future of the history, the future of the book.

00:46.097 --> 00:58.728
I mean, I think the greatest threat, as you'll hear me say there, and if you've seen some of my other pieces, you will see me say elsewhere, you know, the greatest threat to the rare book world is shortage of supply and scarcity material.

01:01.090 --> 01:02.792
Do you think the collective is,

01:06.029 --> 01:08.332
becoming more knowledgeable?

01:08.352 --> 01:12.477
Or do you think that there is a high spot mentality?

01:12.838 --> 01:17.224
I think there's a lot of high spot mentality.

01:17.564 --> 01:18.626
I don't think it's universal.

01:19.707 --> 01:28.038
And this is something I talk about in this talk, but I think that there's a lot of high spot mentality.

01:29.019 --> 01:35.007
I think that what I see more often are people who are very, very busy,

01:36.337 --> 01:38.539
They're people who've made a lot of money.

01:38.779 --> 01:39.880
They're very smart people.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.522
They're very cultured people.

01:42.943 --> 01:44.905
But they have very little time to devote to it.

01:47.988 --> 02:03.964
They're trying to make, they want to form serious collections, but they want to do it without spending time on it.

02:05.227 --> 02:08.110
And I think that inevitably leads itself to high spot thinking.

02:09.912 --> 02:17.380
Because they have this idea that they want to collect books.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.681
They want to collect important books.

02:19.482 --> 02:21.744
But they're incredibly busy.

02:22.845 --> 02:31.234
And they're not going to spend the time they need to spend to get a real grasp of the topic.

02:34.960 --> 02:45.971
I think that's what's happening more than just, you know, somebody saying, well, you know, I just want to collect a list or something like that.

02:47.692 --> 02:50.895
Well, is part of your job educational then?

02:52.437 --> 02:54.079
Yeah, it certainly is.

02:54.099 --> 03:04.849
I mean, I'm certainly trying to persuade people that there's a broader spectrum and there's great interest in a broader spectrum and that the greatest pleasure in collecting is

03:05.960 --> 03:16.231
forming a context and putting together a group of books that interrelate with each other and reflect on each other and that make a sum that's greater than the parts.

03:20.856 --> 03:23.059
But some people are much more open to that than others.

03:23.079 --> 03:32.729
As I said, some people want advice and other people don't want advice.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.431
Some people want advice

03:35.288 --> 03:38.632
And other people just want you to do what they tell them.

03:40.133 --> 03:52.067
And if you're a business person selling something, and somebody doesn't want to hear it, they want to buy that book, but they're not really interested in what you have to say, well, there you go.

03:52.167 --> 03:55.831
I mean, the books are for sale.

03:57.052 --> 04:04.300
I've dealt with one

04:07.722 --> 04:15.809
customer who would ask me, I'd do a catalog, he'd say, what should I be interested in here?

04:15.830 --> 04:20.814
And I'd mark what I, you know, I'd give it some real thought and mark what I thought he ought to be interested in.

04:21.675 --> 04:25.378
He'd never buy anything that I said he ought to be interested in.

04:25.739 --> 04:26.820
He assumed it was a trap.

04:27.721 --> 04:29.883
He'd go through and pick out things that I hadn't said.

04:29.903 --> 04:35.788
Well, of course, once I got the hang of that, I just started telling him, you know, to be interested in things.

04:36.072 --> 04:38.836
But you never buy anything that I suggested.

04:41.760 --> 04:57.343
So, you know, again, like any form of discretionary spending, the book business is always going to deal with issues of ego and, you know, people are doing things for a whole variety of reasons.

04:58.585 --> 05:02.991
And, you know, for a lot of people, there's no question that the fun of acquiring stuff

05:05.300 --> 05:06.622
is they happen to be acquiring.

05:08.845 --> 05:10.308
This is why the auction houses do well.

05:10.929 --> 05:18.139
I mean, the auction houses have made it fun to go out and compete for this stuff.

05:19.001 --> 05:26.893
And the auction houses become real forums for ego.

05:27.714 --> 05:28.856
I mean, I certainly see this.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.780
There are other people I can think of where if they come in person,

05:32.536 --> 05:34.719
You know, it's going to be damn the torpedoes.

05:34.779 --> 05:36.101
You know, they're going to go after it.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.547
And they're going to, you know, get it because their manhood's on the line.

05:40.188 --> 05:43.453
But if they give a bid to somebody, they're going to be much more conservative.

05:44.394 --> 05:49.442
Because at that point, you know, if your agent gets outbid, well, nobody really knows if he was bidding for you.

05:49.462 --> 05:54.389
You know, it's like... I tell the story in this piece I did on Abel Berlin.

05:55.611 --> 05:59.677
My greatest example of that was Dick Manny at the garden sale.

06:00.458 --> 06:01.480
Was he bidding against...

06:02.388 --> 06:06.333
Well, Jim was bidding for Dick.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.975
And Dick was bidding against Jim?

06:08.735 --> 06:09.897
Well, no, Dick started bidding.

06:09.937 --> 06:14.622
Jim got to the point on the Shakespeare's that Dick had told him to go to.

06:14.642 --> 06:18.567
And Jim properly stopped.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.672
And then Manny, Dick stepped in himself.

06:23.713 --> 06:24.894
I was sitting right next to him.

06:24.914 --> 06:26.216
I mean, I was sitting next to Jim.

06:26.256 --> 06:27.417
Dick was sitting right behind us.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.880
And, you know,

06:30.451 --> 06:32.133
Jim was absolutely horrified.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.796
You know, what are you doing?

06:34.637 --> 06:38.122
You know, and then he started bidding, and then we got to that great—were you there?

06:38.363 --> 06:39.104
I was there, yeah.

06:39.124 --> 06:44.091
Yeah, and you remember Marion leaning over and saying, come on, what's under the dust?

06:44.772 --> 06:47.456
No, it's in my book.

06:48.758 --> 06:51.963
What he said was, he paused and he said, think about it.

06:52.263 --> 06:57.331
Yeah, it was the best piece of—best single moment of auctioneering I've ever seen.

06:57.391 --> 06:58.973
That man was a master.

06:59.476 --> 07:01.719
And I happened, and it was just pure coincidence.

07:01.759 --> 07:02.720
It wasn't coincidence.

07:03.721 --> 07:05.042
You talk about serendipity.

07:06.704 --> 07:11.190
John Marion wrote a silly little book, you know, about auctioneering.

07:12.411 --> 07:17.136
And usually the authors I had to have several cuts above that.

07:17.157 --> 07:24.505
But I jumped at the opportunity to go do an interview with him when he came to Boston, just specifically to get to ask him

07:25.480 --> 07:27.102
What the hell were you thinking about?

07:27.262 --> 07:28.944
What happened there?

07:29.985 --> 07:34.529
And all of a sudden he looked at me with some, you know, all of a sudden there was respect in his eyes.

07:34.549 --> 07:43.819
He thought I was just some reporter coming in from Worcester doing a, you know, when actually my motive was to talk to him about Hayward O'Moore and Dick Manny.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.863
And you can see all of a sudden all the defenses going up.

07:48.564 --> 07:50.546
But it's in that last shot.

07:50.606 --> 07:52.568
I've never done a great arc near than John.

07:53.172 --> 07:58.560
I think it's because, I mean, he exemplified everything you could do with an auction.

07:58.680 --> 08:12.440
He was so, you'd watch that man take a sale, he would get so totally into the flow of the action, the rhythm of who was... Hi, do you have the keys to the band?

08:12.460 --> 08:13.121
Yes, I do.

08:14.323 --> 08:14.944
Hold on one sec.

09:00.217 --> 09:25.272
Anyway, he would get himself, and he really did it that evening, so totally into the flow of what was going on in the room, the feeling in the room, who the players were, and how to deal with the players, you know, which, you know, the professionals, and of course he had a great memory there of the people who'd been around for a while, you know, he knew who the players were.

09:27.075 --> 09:30.139
You know, the people that you could deal with efficiently that

09:30.743 --> 09:35.428
you know, the booksellers who, you know, when they stopped, you knew what they were doing and you knew what they were up to.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.252
And then playing something like that.

09:39.272 --> 09:51.304
And then the subtext there, though, however, is that, which we found out later and which I have in that chapter, is that he'd already secured a very substantial line of credit from self-abuse.

09:51.564 --> 09:52.485
Marion knew this.

09:53.366 --> 09:56.669
I mean, he owed them a million dollars on those Shakespeare's.

09:57.189 --> 09:58.070
Oh, of course.

09:58.090 --> 09:58.731
Oh, I knew that.

09:59.211 --> 09:59.772
But I mean,

09:59.853 --> 10:02.316
Marion certainly knew, but, you know, why not?

10:02.336 --> 10:05.158
I mean, we've already told them we'll give them the money for it.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.641
I think that's what's kind of... Oh, there was no concern about that.

10:07.661 --> 10:12.126
I mean, you know, Dick was exactly the kind of buyer they were looking for.

10:12.206 --> 10:14.808
He was paying, he owed them for all kinds of things.

10:14.828 --> 10:16.890
He owed them for Andy Warhol cookie jars.

10:16.910 --> 10:18.492
He owed them for rugs.

10:18.512 --> 10:20.094
He owed them for bad paintings.

10:21.815 --> 10:24.358
And a man seldom existed to wear stays and things.

10:32.185 --> 10:34.848
He doesn't have to be revisiting the money.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.733
No, they were happy to give him the credit.

10:38.773 --> 10:41.777
The question was, could he get another $100,000 bid out of him?

10:43.940 --> 10:55.114
There are some sales, the Siebert sale did this a little bit, where it gets going, and of course this is what every auctioneer wants.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.560
There's the feeling that this is the new paradigm.

11:00.113 --> 11:05.938
And the sale that I was at that had that the most was the first SANG sale, the Phillips SANG autograph sales.

11:06.779 --> 11:08.581
That was in 78, I guess.

11:09.902 --> 11:14.967
And that sale started off, and Marion was taking the sale.

11:16.448 --> 11:20.552
And the first lot went for three times what everybody thought it would go for.

11:20.572 --> 11:23.415
The second lot went for the same.

11:23.435 --> 11:26.998
And Marion didn't kind of slow down.

11:27.383 --> 11:29.346
to make it easier for all these bids to come.

11:29.386 --> 11:32.551
Marion, he speeded it up.

11:32.571 --> 11:37.359
And it became this, it just started to, you know, it was like a whirlwind.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.683
He was going faster and faster.

11:40.143 --> 11:50.600
And everybody's sitting there thinking, you know, there's just started to be this feeling like the train is leaving the station, and if I don't step on board right now, I'm done for, you know.

11:51.602 --> 11:51.822
And...

11:52.342 --> 11:55.485
people started going, oh, shit, you know, I mean, this is it.

11:55.545 --> 11:58.848
You know, I mean, I bet if I buy these things, I mean, what's going to happen tomorrow?

11:58.888 --> 12:03.072
Everybody's going to see these prices, and, you know, I'll never be able to buy another thing again.

12:03.132 --> 12:06.135
And it was just incredible, just amazing.

12:06.155 --> 12:11.640
You know, in fact, when I go back now and I think, there's always some, I met my new editor yesterday, HarperCollins.

12:12.161 --> 12:17.326
They're buying my, they're taking my book.

12:17.346 --> 12:18.467
So we had lunch yesterday.

12:19.325 --> 12:21.928
And he says to me, well, where do you get these stories?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.652
Where do you hear about these things?

12:24.712 --> 12:26.314
I said, well, you know, you'd be surprised.

12:26.374 --> 12:27.195
I mean, you have to go out.

12:27.275 --> 12:28.217
You can't stay at home.

12:28.277 --> 12:30.680
You can't talk on the telephone.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.162
We're back on again.

12:32.322 --> 12:45.940
Which is that in terms of sense of profession, I think, you know, one of the things the European tradition I see is not just a tradition of scholarship, but a continuity of knowledge.

12:46.679 --> 13:04.686
And the big old European firms, and a person like Barney is the foremost example of this, were the beneficiaries not only of that tradition of scholarship, but literally growing up in the material, and of learning things from the people who preceded them in the business.

13:05.788 --> 13:16.163
And in that sense, I feel in my career, I've been particularly fortunate, extremely fortunate, and only people besides me

13:16.733 --> 13:21.960
have more of this from people like Rusty Mott, say, who were born into the business and are second generation.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.401
Say again, who was that person?

13:23.442 --> 13:24.042
Rusty Mott.

13:24.984 --> 13:29.950
He was Father Howard, Howard Billismott, Howard Mott.

13:30.871 --> 13:38.040
But I really had a great opportunity because I got into this business when I was quite young.

13:38.521 --> 13:43.467
And because of the people I knew and the contacts I had quite young,

13:44.071 --> 13:47.695
that I got to know a lot of the people who were my predecessors.

13:48.857 --> 14:04.656
Michael Walsh, Fickett Speeds, Lindley Eberstadt, Peter Decker, you know, some other less well-known people who were people who's experienced, or Warren Howell, for that matter, who I was very friendly with and did a lot of business with.

14:05.096 --> 14:09.301
You know, people's experience in the book trade went back into the 20s.

14:10.443 --> 14:12.525
I got to know very well whether

14:12.877 --> 14:16.340
I was a young man and really got to know on a personal, friendly basis.

14:17.461 --> 14:26.569
And they, in turn, I'm sorry, Peter Decker had known Wilberforce Eames when he was a young man, and Eames was an old man in the New York public.

14:26.609 --> 14:28.911
And I feel that continuity very much.

14:30.093 --> 14:37.759
You know, that I can go back, you know, somebody I knew, and you're covering 100 years of the antiquarian books in this country.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.622
So...

14:41.142 --> 14:55.695
That's something that I feel very much about my career in the book business is that I've always tried to be in the context of the people that preceded me in the business and to know about them and what they did.

14:55.715 --> 15:03.082
Other than Archie, is there anyone that you would describe as a mentor?

15:03.102 --> 15:06.605
I mean, did you have any kind of mentor?

15:06.625 --> 15:09.107
My first real mentor in the book business was a guy named Jeff Dykes.

15:09.644 --> 15:15.895
who isn't that well-known, but he was on my Americanist alphabet there.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.924
Jeff was a great collector of Western Americana.

15:21.024 --> 15:23.449
His real career was in the Soil Conservation Service.

15:23.469 --> 15:26.474
At one point, he was the head of field operations in the Soil Conservation Service.

15:26.695 --> 15:27.556
Which conservation?

15:27.717 --> 15:28.999
The Soil Conservation Service.

15:29.079 --> 15:30.201
How do you spell it?

15:30.221 --> 15:30.882
S-O-I-L.

15:30.902 --> 15:31.123
Okay.

15:31.163 --> 15:31.563
Oh, Soil.

15:31.684 --> 15:32.445
Okay.

15:32.881 --> 15:39.330
You have to understand when I'm transcribing this, if I don't get it right, it's hard.

15:39.350 --> 15:40.872
You're forever working on it.

15:40.892 --> 15:54.450
But, I mean, Jeff was a guy who was born in West Texas in 1900, grew up in Texas, started collecting books when he was a high school principal in West Texas in the 1920s.

15:55.375 --> 16:02.984
And then put together an incredible collection because his job basically was driving around the country checking on all these field offices.

16:03.224 --> 16:08.391
So he had reason to be in every town and every place.

16:08.911 --> 16:14.658
And at that point, you could still buy a tremendous number of books going in places as you went around.

16:14.678 --> 16:16.941
So he managed to work in a lot of bookstores along the way.

16:17.862 --> 16:22.007
And when he retired at age 65 in 1965, he went into the book business.

16:23.152 --> 16:25.014
and was active early until about 1980.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.375
Where was he located?

16:26.735 --> 16:28.717
In College Park, Maryland.

16:28.797 --> 16:34.202
At that point, he moved to Washington when he got high enough up in the federal bureaucracy.

16:35.183 --> 16:40.408
So, I saw a lot of him when I was in high school, and as soon as I had a driver's license.

16:40.868 --> 16:43.090
So you had actually put him in the mentor category?

16:43.271 --> 16:43.811
Oh, absolutely.

16:43.931 --> 16:47.715
My book on folks in the cattle industry is dedicated to him.

16:47.735 --> 16:51.218
It's my first book, and very much so.

16:51.738 --> 16:53.400
How many books, to your credit?

16:54.642 --> 16:58.147
Well, you know, it depends what you call a book.

16:58.207 --> 17:01.091
I mean, really— Well, I mean, things have been written and been published.

17:01.111 --> 17:04.675
Six score and this are really the two hard-bound things.

17:06.518 --> 17:11.425
We're issuing catalog 189, so that's about a six-foot shelf.

17:11.565 --> 17:11.865
Wow.

17:11.885 --> 17:12.206
189.

17:13.147 --> 17:13.808
How many a year?

17:14.669 --> 17:15.450
About ten a year.

17:16.561 --> 17:18.363
We'll have 200 next year.

17:18.383 --> 17:19.704
We'll have 200 in 2,000.

17:19.724 --> 17:21.886
I'm going to do a catalog of 20 great things.

17:21.906 --> 17:26.770
It's going to be 20 catalog 200, 20 things in the year 2,000.

17:27.051 --> 17:28.111
And when in 2,000?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.293
Do you figure you'll have that?

17:30.354 --> 17:32.696
Oh, probably about this time next year.

17:32.716 --> 17:33.156
Yeah, next fall.

17:33.176 --> 17:35.498
This is too late to get into this book.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.361
Okay, well, you know what?

17:38.381 --> 17:41.544
I think... Yeah, I want to give you a little... Show me around a little bit.

17:41.564 --> 17:42.224
No, say that again.

17:42.244 --> 17:43.445
Start again if there's an example.

17:43.465 --> 17:46.348
There's an example of what a context of a collection...

17:47.797 --> 17:49.540
this color plate collection is it.

17:49.620 --> 17:59.997
Because the thing that unifies this group of books is that these are books published in America with plates printed in America in color in the 19th century.

18:00.197 --> 18:10.313
That covers a vast range of subject matter from fashion to natural history to view books to medical books to what have you.

18:10.333 --> 18:14.580
When you have them all together here, and they don't take up that much room as you can see,

18:15.623 --> 18:17.605
One, two, three, four, five, six.

18:18.186 --> 18:20.208
One, two, three, four, five, six.

18:20.228 --> 18:20.769
Yeah, it's a bad idea.

18:20.789 --> 18:22.310
I got about 700 titles.

18:22.390 --> 18:25.133
I got a closet full of big folios in the other room.

18:25.874 --> 18:30.359
But you can start pulling these books out, looking at different things.

18:30.379 --> 18:32.161
These are arranged chronologically here.

18:32.922 --> 18:36.826
In any big library, these things are going to be scattered through a vast range of things.

18:37.567 --> 18:42.913
Even the most accommodating libraries won't let you check out more than four or five books at a time.

18:43.737 --> 18:54.292
Here, we've got a database set up that's cross-indexed by the people who did the prints, by chronologically, by the places they were printed.

18:54.932 --> 18:58.758
If we want to see what's happening in Philadelphia in a period, we can just pull them all off and look at them.

18:58.918 --> 19:04.866
If we want to look at the work of a specific printer over time, we can pull that off and look at them.

19:05.387 --> 19:07.289
This is a research collection, then.

19:07.309 --> 19:11.415
It's a research collection, and its ability to be a great research collection

19:12.053 --> 19:18.923
depends on it being in one place and all there where you can pull things off the shelf and compare them.

19:18.943 --> 19:20.264
And you simply can't do that.

19:20.545 --> 19:22.868
It's not a fault of the great research libraries.

19:22.888 --> 19:27.134
They can't allow that to happen and protect their collections.

19:28.055 --> 19:30.759
But here, I can't allow it to happen.

19:30.859 --> 19:38.550
So anybody who wanted to work in this field, they could do more here in an afternoon than they could do in a research library in days and days.

19:39.087 --> 19:43.151
and they'd still miss things over there because they can't put all the stuff together in front of them at once.

19:43.171 --> 19:49.378
So that is the advantage that a serious collector might have over an institutional... Absolutely.

19:49.398 --> 19:49.959
Absolutely.

19:49.979 --> 19:53.363
So where do you see the fate of a collection like this?

19:54.624 --> 19:57.948
I suspect it has to remain together as a collection.

19:57.968 --> 20:01.772
Well, I'd certainly like to do... Which lets counter to what a bookseller's mandate is.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.874
Yeah, I mean, in this case, it's a work in progress.

20:03.934 --> 20:07.138
I've been working on this show that was at the Groll Air Club and doing that book.

20:07.218 --> 20:09.060
That show is definitely going to go

20:09.412 --> 20:10.975
In a couple years, it's going to be at the Huntington.

20:11.335 --> 20:11.676
Nice.

20:11.696 --> 20:14.821
It's also going to be at the Carter Museum in Fort Worth and some other stops.

20:14.861 --> 20:15.462
Oh, congratulations.

20:15.522 --> 20:20.370
I'm working on my bigger book on American Colorplate books right now.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.996
So it's been so much a work in progress and a work in collection.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.279
I'm adding to it and doing this show and everything.

20:26.780 --> 20:29.805
I haven't really thought in the long run, what do I do?

20:29.885 --> 20:32.770
But I'd certainly like to try to keep it together somewhere or another.

20:33.745 --> 20:35.628
So where do you do your research for this?

20:35.648 --> 20:37.190
Do you have the materials here?

20:37.270 --> 20:39.794
Do you have to go across the street, or do you go up to MDS?

20:40.014 --> 20:51.932
Well, for some reference material I've got here, the books I've got here, things I don't have I have to go to other libraries, and just about any reference material I have that I don't have here is across the street.

20:51.972 --> 20:53.414
Of course, that's true of everything we do.

20:53.555 --> 20:57.260
It's the great thing about being in the shadow of a major university.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.884
Quite literally, yeah.

21:00.485 --> 21:02.588
Sterling has just about anything you can think of.

21:02.956 --> 21:22.517
And in terms of husbanding your time, is this something that you definitely do for pleasure, or is this—how much of your day would you say— Well, it tends to go in fits and starts.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.640
Rainy Saturday, and I'll spend a rainy Saturday doing it.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.686
But it's something done in your own time as opposed to the bookseller time.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.611
It's very difficult to draw a line between my own time and bookseller time.

21:34.631 --> 21:35.593
I am what I do.

21:35.613 --> 21:43.965
As I said, I read catalogs at home in the evening, but I read them the way that people sit there and read the newspaper.

21:44.025 --> 21:49.673
It's light entertainment as well as being work.

21:50.294 --> 21:51.576
Would you say all of these books

21:52.096 --> 21:55.721
If they were in an institution, pretty much most of them would be in special collections?

21:56.101 --> 22:05.232
Most of them would be, although the price range here, what I paid for these books, ranges from $2.50 to six figures.

22:05.453 --> 22:09.157
But, you know, what you paid is quite irrelevant to the value you've perceived.

22:09.378 --> 22:10.479
Oh, absolutely.

22:10.499 --> 22:11.881
There's no question about that.

22:11.941 --> 22:14.844
And the synergistic quality that it gets by being a collection.

22:15.205 --> 22:20.832
Actually, the book I paid $2.50 for is a very important book.

22:20.852 --> 22:20.972
But...

22:22.623 --> 22:26.008
running my catalogs, by the way, so that's what we're up to right now.

22:26.028 --> 22:26.809
Oh, wow, that's great.

22:27.069 --> 22:28.771
And so what's the $2.50 book?

22:29.272 --> 22:37.483
It's actually the first book printed in the trichromatic halftones, if you look in, is the last book in the exhibition.

22:37.503 --> 22:42.030
And it's one of those cases I bought it because it fit my criteria.

22:42.430 --> 22:51.162
It's an ugly book, and I didn't understand until I started putting the show together, which is, I think, the great value of working with your books.

22:51.665 --> 22:54.569
And it's a great value, the creative mess theory of collecting.

22:54.589 --> 22:55.269
Creative mess?

22:55.710 --> 22:56.611
I like it.

22:56.631 --> 22:58.113
Critical mess, excuse me.

22:58.133 --> 23:00.416
The critical mess, the Zinman critical mess theory.

23:00.616 --> 23:10.168
I simply bought books to fit the context, and then I tried to figure out what they meant, just as the same principle Michael has applied to his collective.

23:10.768 --> 23:11.990
And this was a perfect case.

23:12.431 --> 23:15.334
It was an ugly book, but it fitted the criteria, so I bought it.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.896
And where did you find it for $250?

23:17.821 --> 23:18.802
Oh, God.

23:18.962 --> 23:19.643
Flea Market?

23:19.823 --> 23:20.664
Lord knows.

23:20.684 --> 23:21.785
Lord knows.

23:22.606 --> 23:23.247
I don't remember.

23:23.427 --> 23:25.629
So wasn't anything that jumped out at you at the moment?

23:25.709 --> 23:27.852
It's, again, something that you determined after that.

23:27.872 --> 23:33.618
As I researched it, I came to realize that it was this great landmark in history book production.

23:33.638 --> 23:34.198
250.

23:34.459 --> 23:40.505
And lots of people at the show thought it was great.

23:40.525 --> 23:45.010
That's great.

23:45.563 --> 23:52.330
I think the other context of a collection like this is that it does allow—it gets rid of preconceptions.

23:52.431 --> 24:12.853
Instead of going in with a theory and looking at books you know about and saying, well, I'm going to look at this book and this book and this book because they fit my theory, you have the books, and the books force you to look at the books and draw a conclusion the other way around.

24:13.357 --> 24:21.694
Some of the things I thought about color playbooks turned out to be completely wrong, as I kind of was faced with the evidence of the critical mess.

24:23.357 --> 24:27.465
Just to give you the range, then, you said you've gone from $2.50 to six figures.

24:27.526 --> 24:31.213
What would an example of the six-figure be?

24:33.235 --> 24:37.021
And this also is in the catalog, too.

24:37.041 --> 24:38.744
Yeah, this is number one in the catalog.

24:38.824 --> 24:40.226
So, number one and the last item.

24:40.386 --> 24:42.169
Oh, this is the city of Philadelphia.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.152
Philadelphia in the year 1800s.

24:44.172 --> 24:44.914
Oh, that's wonderful.

24:45.995 --> 24:48.259
So this was not something you found at a flea market.

24:48.279 --> 24:48.479
No.

24:48.920 --> 24:54.970
As a matter of fact, this copy belonged to Nick Wainwright, Nicholas Wainwright, who was the great expert on early Philadelphia.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.833
That's the illustration that's in the book, I think.

24:56.853 --> 24:58.956
Yeah, that's one in the book.

24:59.527 --> 25:00.869
There are a number of other things.

25:00.909 --> 25:03.893
There are the Indians being shown around Philadelphia.

25:05.936 --> 25:13.848
This is a book that's constantly used for illustrations by all kinds of modern historical things, because it's the best group of pictures there is.

25:13.868 --> 25:23.803
Now this belonged at one point to Nick Wainwright who did Philadelphia and the Romantic Ancient Lithography, so this is a copy that's been in the hands of people who knew exactly what this book was for some time.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.690
And how long have you had that?

25:30.070 --> 25:34.754
So that is a major acquisition when it comes— Yeah.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.596
You feel terrific when you get there, right?

25:37.337 --> 25:40.720
Well, I don't know that I feel any more terrific, actually, than I do about some of the others.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.422
This is what I've had probably the longest here.

25:43.442 --> 25:48.167
This is one of the proof plates for the Audubon quadrupeds.

25:48.387 --> 25:48.627
Wow.

25:48.707 --> 25:49.888
So this is before Lenners.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.631
Audubon took this with him on his last expedition.

25:53.131 --> 25:56.354
He'd just gotten the proofs of the first fifteen plates.

25:56.374 --> 25:59.537
And what does that say there?

25:59.872 --> 26:07.967
Actually, that says, inscribed to James Henry Carlton of the U.S.

26:07.987 --> 26:13.898
Dragoons, October 9, 1843, by his friend and servant, John James Audubon.

26:14.165 --> 26:21.216
Carlton was a young army lieutenant who took him buffalo hunting at Fort Union there from Missouri, and he gave this to him as a thank you present.

26:21.296 --> 26:23.800
And describe the content of the picture.

26:24.401 --> 26:26.824
This is the American Chipmunks, which is plate eight.

26:27.145 --> 26:31.211
Downstairs I have plate one, which is American Wildcat, that has a similar inscription.

26:31.692 --> 26:34.837
And then Carlton gave it to one of his sisters, which is that inscription there.

26:34.857 --> 26:36.059
So it's got great associates.

26:36.079 --> 26:41.607
I bought these from Kenny Newman at the old print shop in 1971.

26:42.548 --> 26:44.370
They're worth a lot more than what I think for them.

26:44.430 --> 26:45.171
I would think so.

26:46.232 --> 26:52.759
But there are things that are gems to me.

26:53.780 --> 26:58.244
Because you develop a context, you start to realize what some of these things are.

26:58.264 --> 27:01.408
That's the essence of a collection, isn't it?

27:06.293 --> 27:10.497
I have here one of the most remarkable things, and this is something I knew about.

27:11.135 --> 27:28.197
Because of working on that show at the Yale Library, the Illustrating Traveler show, I worked quite a bit with the books from the Abbey collection that Paul Mellon gave to the British Art Center.

27:28.217 --> 27:33.224
And there were some remarkable books in Abbey.

27:34.165 --> 27:40.433
And there was a case where, you know, I spent a couple days over there just looking at Abbey books.

27:41.273 --> 27:43.536
So you see all these books that hardly ever come up.

27:45.418 --> 27:59.414
In the context of this, this is a book by a man named Jan Bellisario called Sketches of Character in Illustration of the Habits and Occupation and Costume of the Negro Population on the Island of Jamaica.

28:00.015 --> 28:01.276
Is that I-M or J-M?

28:01.757 --> 28:05.101
Looks like an I. I-M, yes.

28:05.261 --> 28:07.163
B-E-L-I-S-A-R-I-O.

28:07.548 --> 28:10.952
And this is published in Kingston, Jamaica in 1837.

28:11.393 --> 28:17.561
Now, it's hard enough to find Jamaican prints in that period, but this is right after Emancipation.

28:18.823 --> 28:26.933
And all the illustrations are lithographed in Kingston, and they show Mardi Gras costumes in Kingston.

28:27.874 --> 28:31.699
I mean, there are about four known copies of this thing.

28:32.380 --> 28:33.382
These are all hand-colored.

28:33.502 --> 28:37.487
All hand-colored, yeah, hand-colored lithographs.

28:37.687 --> 28:38.829
I saw this.

28:38.949 --> 28:42.314
So this is a case of, you know, educated serendipity.

28:43.635 --> 28:44.937
You know, I'd seen this thing.

28:44.997 --> 28:46.119
I'd seen the melon coffee.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.020
I'd exhibited it.

28:48.122 --> 28:51.386
And, you know, one day, actually last summer.

28:51.747 --> 28:53.970
This is not in the catalog, is it?

28:54.270 --> 28:55.232
No, it's not in the catalog.

28:55.292 --> 28:56.974
I got this too late to get in the show.

28:57.054 --> 28:58.897
Otherwise, I would have put it in the show.

28:59.037 --> 29:02.061
I would have put it in the show otherwise.

29:02.161 --> 29:04.985
But in this case.

29:05.005 --> 29:06.107
I didn't see it there.

29:06.543 --> 29:07.925
No, no, it's not there.

29:10.448 --> 29:15.894
I was in London, and one of my colleagues said to me, say, have you ever heard of a thing by a guy named Bellisario?

29:17.296 --> 29:19.638
And I said, oh, sure, you mean the Jamaica thing?

29:20.820 --> 29:23.162
And he looked very deflated.

29:23.503 --> 29:25.125
And he said, oh, you know about it?

29:25.465 --> 29:28.589
And I said casually, oh, sure, of course I know about it.

29:28.629 --> 29:29.750
Yeah, Bellisario.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.213
You know, it's the thing that's a Mardi Gras picture, it's done in Kingston.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.681
And he said, God, I thought it was incredibly rare.

29:35.701 --> 29:39.086
And I said, oh, I guess it must be scarce, but, you know, of course I know about it.

29:40.327 --> 29:44.934
And he said, well, you know, are you interested?

29:45.034 --> 29:47.056
And I said, oh, sure, you know, I'd buy it.

29:48.578 --> 29:55.548
But I think there's no question that I got a better price, because I don't think he figured out what he wanted to ask yet.

29:55.608 --> 30:01.255
And I think when it turned out that I knew all about it, instead of it being, you know, something...

30:01.488 --> 30:06.472
So what was going on inside while he was telling you this?

30:06.492 --> 30:13.178
Well, I do these things almost automatically.

30:13.419 --> 30:17.302
But anyway, I'm very, very pleased with that.

30:17.362 --> 30:25.269
And I knew exactly what it was, but the thought that I'd get to buy one was very far from my mind.

30:25.550 --> 30:27.591
Educated serendipity.

30:27.751 --> 30:29.453
Educated serendipity, exactly.

30:31.475 --> 30:42.349
This is, well, a lot of my Melville stuff is up at my house, but I've got some of my other bits and pieces of collections.

30:42.389 --> 30:54.544
Had you been reading Melville for pleasure, or was this just... Well, that's really why I started collecting Melville, because I decided to read Melville from beginning to end, and so I started at Type-P and I chronologically.

30:54.584 --> 30:56.507
I didn't start collecting it, actually, until I read it all.

30:57.408 --> 30:59.511
But after I'd read it all, then I started collecting.

31:00.312 --> 31:01.313
And for a while I collected.

31:03.352 --> 31:05.534
after Harry D. Smith at the library.

31:06.415 --> 31:12.342
I guess, books, association books that I liked, and association books that had interest to me.

31:12.422 --> 31:19.469
So, for example, I always like to put Terry Sutherland's The Magic Christian, which I have the manuscript of now.

31:19.489 --> 31:29.540
I have a great collection of Robert Byron, the American, the English travel writer.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.143
B-Y-R-O-N.

31:32.663 --> 31:34.226
And I collected for a while.

31:34.246 --> 31:36.970
I had a lot of little literary collections.

31:36.990 --> 31:42.159
Bill, you've been very generous with your time.

31:43.662 --> 31:46.286
Oh, you're not done with the tour.

31:46.307 --> 31:48.009
You're going to see it all.

31:48.050 --> 31:48.911
That's fine.

31:49.031 --> 31:50.714
I just feel guilty to you.

31:52.096 --> 31:55.903
This is the folio part of the tour.

31:56.710 --> 31:59.573
This is, of course, where they tend to be the most expensive of the color plate.

31:59.673 --> 32:01.556
Is that an elephant folio size?

32:01.616 --> 32:04.239
Yeah, that is elephant folio, actually.

32:04.259 --> 32:06.161
The big Audubon is double elephant folio.

32:06.181 --> 32:12.408
That's a set of the quads, the folio quads, which is called imperial folio.

32:12.969 --> 32:16.413
But that would be elephant folio, and the big one's double elephant folio.

32:16.553 --> 32:19.497
What's that Moby Dick box over there?

32:19.677 --> 32:26.565
That's the original box for the Rockwell Camp Moby Dick.

32:27.659 --> 32:28.460
Wow.

32:29.801 --> 32:31.463
You have my attention on that one.

32:32.064 --> 32:32.785
The blocks.

32:33.245 --> 32:34.667
Yeah, it's the proofs.

32:34.907 --> 32:37.049
It's the proofs of all illustrations.

32:37.069 --> 32:37.730
That's pretty good.

32:38.011 --> 32:38.751
Yeah.

32:38.771 --> 32:40.273
Congratulations.

32:40.593 --> 32:45.959
Yeah, that's, you know, the greatest illustrations that the movie did.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.963
And then this goes into the other building here.

32:50.204 --> 32:52.967
So this is more reference books in a variety of areas.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.451
And this is...

32:56.819 --> 33:01.587
They're counting and more reference books.

33:02.649 --> 33:05.614
I've put up a lot of visiting booksellers who are going through here.

33:05.674 --> 33:07.998
This is the bibliographical suite.

33:08.018 --> 33:11.324
We call this the bibliographical suite.

33:11.344 --> 33:12.927
This is the bibliographical suite.

33:12.947 --> 33:16.954
What we're looking at is about a twin mattress on the floor.

33:17.238 --> 33:18.540
What do you call it, a what?

33:18.560 --> 33:20.743
A futon, you know, like a Japanese futon.

33:20.803 --> 33:21.805
Oh, okay, sure.

33:21.905 --> 33:23.988
The one over there is the color plate suite.

33:24.048 --> 33:25.230
You can ask Jim Cummins.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.573
Jim Cummins has been a guest many times.

33:28.174 --> 33:35.685
This is another area I've collected quite a bit, which is association bibliographies, for example.

33:36.408 --> 33:42.074
This is Henry Harese's Biblioteca Americana Vistissimo, which is the first great American bibliography.

33:42.114 --> 33:43.556
It's extraordinarily important, yeah.

33:43.576 --> 33:43.856
Yeah.

33:43.876 --> 33:48.381
And this is John Russell Bartlett's copy, who was— That's a double whammy.

33:48.602 --> 33:51.605
Yeah, who was, of course, John Carter Brown's first librarian.

33:52.085 --> 33:57.131
And then here are all the letters from Harese to Bartlett are laid in the front.

33:57.151 --> 34:01.656
Now, are you tempted to sign your name into something like this?

34:02.092 --> 34:03.073
I mean, you could.

34:03.133 --> 34:06.336
I could, and I probably will in some form.

34:06.356 --> 34:07.778
I mean, I've never gotten a book plate.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.284
I would think for this collection it would really be appropriate, wouldn't you think?

34:13.544 --> 34:14.465
Yeah.

34:14.925 --> 34:17.828
I think of any of the collections I've borne, probably.

34:18.609 --> 34:22.854
And how many volumes approximately would you say this number is?

34:22.874 --> 34:24.575
Oh, gosh, there's a ton of stuff here.

34:24.595 --> 34:26.197
There's a lot of stuff at the warehouse.

34:26.217 --> 34:31.963
There's a lot of ephemeral material, you know, of catalogs and things like that.

34:33.293 --> 34:38.939
So it probably—I mean, for example, a lot of it is material like this.

34:39.039 --> 34:45.546
These are a series of important auction catalogs, like the Alfred T. White sale.

34:46.548 --> 34:49.351
This is actually the sale out of Eversau's stock.

34:49.891 --> 34:55.217
All of these belong to Lathrop Harper, who's, of course, one of the great Americana booksellers.

34:55.237 --> 34:57.900
And all these are Harper's copies marked up at the sale.

34:58.589 --> 35:04.156
So there's a real, you know, I bought from Steve when he broke up the Papantonio reference books.

35:04.176 --> 35:06.640
I bought a ton of that stuff, and a lot of that's down in my office.

35:07.320 --> 35:11.947
So at Papantonio, Seven Gables had gotten George D. Smith's stuff.

35:11.967 --> 35:15.712
So for example, something like Dupuis, the guy who did the Indian 3D catalog.

35:16.392 --> 35:19.096
Dupuis's sale in 1920 was the biggest sale of that.

35:19.116 --> 35:22.260
Well, I've got the Papantonio George D. Smith copy.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.204
I got it all marked up with George D. Smith's bids for Huntington.

35:25.589 --> 35:27.671
what George D. Smith bought, what he didn't buy.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.473
Your book plate should really go in there.

35:29.493 --> 35:40.724
I mean, that is a tinker to evers to chance kind of a... And so, I mean, this stuff mixes, you know, it mixes an interest in the background of these things with real applications.

35:40.824 --> 35:48.331
I mean, when we got to Siebert, we had the biggest bunch of Indian treaties in one place since the Edgar sale, or the Dupuis sale in 1920.

35:49.332 --> 35:52.115
I've got George D. Smith's marked copies of those sales.

35:52.155 --> 35:53.396
You can see what they're going on then.

35:53.436 --> 35:54.297
That's something I can

35:54.631 --> 35:57.677
working with my customers, I can give them that kind of context.

35:57.737 --> 35:59.901
I can say, well, look, here's this one and that one.

35:59.942 --> 36:02.346
It went for twice as much, the last time the two of them were up together.

36:02.386 --> 36:04.130
I mean, it means something.

36:07.336 --> 36:09.881
This is one I'm always very pleased with.

36:09.901 --> 36:16.875
This is one of Everstott's greatest catalogs in the Northwest Coast.

36:17.176 --> 36:22.424
Personal Narratives of Discovery, Conquest, and Exploration to the Eberstadt and Sons.

36:22.444 --> 36:22.624
Right.

36:22.644 --> 36:24.206
This came out in 39 or so.

36:24.226 --> 36:25.308
It's a beautiful catalog.

36:25.388 --> 36:26.630
Read that inscription.

36:26.650 --> 36:27.331
Why don't you read it?

36:27.491 --> 36:28.733
I'd like it in your voice.

36:28.753 --> 36:37.266
It says, To Dr. Lathrop C. Harper, my friend, and so proved these three decades and more sincerely, Edward Eberstadt.

36:38.367 --> 36:39.589
June 14, 1941.

36:39.609 --> 36:39.889
Yeah.

36:40.510 --> 36:41.352
And then what does this say?

36:41.372 --> 36:45.057
It says, Bring only discovery.

36:46.707 --> 36:48.209
Discovered or something?

36:48.249 --> 36:50.732
Discovered or something.

36:52.053 --> 36:53.154
Discovered a coast.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.457
Bering only discovered a coast.

36:55.978 --> 36:56.138
Oh.

36:56.658 --> 36:58.881
Bering only discovered a coast.

36:58.901 --> 37:01.304
But I found a good friend, Ed.

37:01.324 --> 37:01.784
Isn't that great?

37:03.706 --> 37:06.550
That's wonderful, isn't it?

37:06.570 --> 37:08.291
Yeah.

37:08.312 --> 37:15.820
Let's see if we can find any others that are— These are Bartlett's copies of the Brown catalog.

37:16.238 --> 37:19.141
Explain for my tape recorder the significance of Bartlett.

37:20.302 --> 37:25.607
John Russell Bartlett was actually the first rare book dealer to specialize in Americana.

37:26.248 --> 37:42.263
He was then John Carter Brown's librarian, prepared on the John Carter Brown catalog, and he was in many ways the most significant figure in nineteenth-century American bibliography.

37:42.867 --> 37:46.331
And so those are his copies of the catalogs he prepared.

37:47.332 --> 37:50.255
Of the Brown catalogs.

37:50.335 --> 37:51.356
I'm amazed that J.C.

37:51.396 --> 37:52.417
Brown doesn't have those.

37:53.478 --> 37:57.182
Well, we've got Brown's copies of the Brown catalogs.

37:57.763 --> 38:00.546
One of the greatest bibliographers of that period was E.C.

38:00.566 --> 38:01.186
Calseca.

38:02.868 --> 38:03.289
Wow, look at that.

38:03.309 --> 38:06.672
He was the bibliographer of early Mexican immigrants.

38:06.692 --> 38:07.373
That's gorgeous.

38:07.393 --> 38:09.415
So there's the Bibliographia Mexicana.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.023
of the 18th century.

38:12.764 --> 38:18.150
And this is Thomas W. Streeter's copy in Streeter's typical handwriting.

38:20.213 --> 38:21.294
And let's see.

38:22.475 --> 38:23.917
I'll excavate a little bit here.

38:25.139 --> 38:32.608
Well, in another vein over there, if you look at that run right there, that's White House's set.

38:33.549 --> 38:37.073
White, W-R-A-G-H-T, House, H-O-W-E-S.

38:37.238 --> 38:45.990
So Wright-House, as you probably know, did U.S.E.I., which is the primary bibliography of kind of nineteenth-century America.

38:46.010 --> 38:48.393
It's certainly the most usable single bibliography.

38:49.715 --> 38:56.144
And here is the first draft of it in manuscript down in the back.

38:56.164 --> 39:05.457
And Howes was famous for always traveling with his little black books that he'd note down bibliographical details in.

39:06.652 --> 39:09.815
Those were turned into U.S.iana, and here are the little black books.

39:10.216 --> 39:11.337
Now where did you get this stuff?

39:11.957 --> 39:17.003
This all was dispersed when Hal's died and went to Southern Book Scout.

39:18.144 --> 39:22.628
But this is the working material for U.S.iana, and Hal always carried these with him.

39:23.329 --> 39:26.332
Book Scouts are pretty good, aren't they?

39:26.352 --> 39:29.816
When this tapes off, I'll tell you what I just got from a Midwestern Book Scout.

39:30.837 --> 39:36.102
Then, you know, after Streeter died, all the stuff that was

39:36.723 --> 39:42.230
of sub-importance, not worth putting in sale, was divided between Eversus and Goodspeeds.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.812
Goodspeeds got most of the bibliographies.

39:44.613 --> 39:51.522
And I bought from them, this was back in the late 70s, Streeter's runs of most booksellers' catalogs that he had.

39:51.562 --> 39:53.744
So this is like his Henry Stevens run.

39:53.844 --> 40:02.275
All these are marked up by Streeter, with what he had, what he was thinking of ordering, what he was interested in.

40:03.976 --> 40:13.189
That run of the month of Goodspeeds is Streeter's run, so it's annotated throughout by Streeter, with what's of interest to him, and stuff like that.

40:13.229 --> 40:16.253
Do you get worthwhile information out of the annotations?

40:16.693 --> 40:18.636
Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

40:19.137 --> 40:26.727
I mean, often in terms of provenance, you know, in a lot of these books there are not a lot of copies of them, and if you know where they went,

40:27.230 --> 40:41.388
You know, when I first got to be friends with Siebert, in fact, one of the ways that I kind of established my bona fides with Siebert, who had a pretty high level of what he expected, was it was a very rare book, which there were like eight, nine copies.

40:42.870 --> 40:47.036
And the last copy had gone through the Eberstadt's hands in 1958.

40:47.496 --> 40:54.165
And I had the annotated catalog that had marked that he had it.

40:54.584 --> 40:59.672
I wrote him a letter and said, you know, I've located seven of the eight copies, and I think you have the eight.

41:00.734 --> 41:04.220
And he wrote me back and said, you know, how the hell did you know that?

41:04.240 --> 41:05.842
And I said, oh, well, I just know.

41:06.523 --> 41:08.427
You know, I just guessed.

41:08.447 --> 41:09.769
You know, I'm just a smart guy.

41:10.670 --> 41:16.660
But that's the kind of thing it takes to establish the credibility, I guess, and

41:21.398 --> 41:34.309
This is Streeter's Bibliography of Texas, which of course is his biggest work, which is dedicated to Henry Wagner, a great bibliographer.

41:34.329 --> 41:36.093
And this is the presentation copy.

41:36.113 --> 41:38.479
And you can read it to Henry Wagner.

41:38.864 --> 41:45.912
To whom is Henry R. Wagner, to whom this is dedicated, comma, with the affectionate regards of his old friend Tom Streeter.

41:46.273 --> 41:47.314
Manchester, New Jersey.

41:47.674 --> 41:49.416
Morristown, New Jersey.

41:49.477 --> 41:51.999
December 30th, 1955.

41:57.186 --> 42:01.591
So this is, and some of these aren't pretty associations.

42:01.671 --> 42:06.036
This is, for example, what's considered the first Americana bibliography there.

42:06.877 --> 42:12.726
catalog of the library of White Kennet, the Biblioteca Americana Primordia, which was done in London in 1713.

42:12.746 --> 42:14.489
1713.

42:14.569 --> 42:15.130
Yeah.

42:15.531 --> 42:24.645
Not much reference value in this, but although I do have in stock downstairs one of White Kennet's copies, this library's broken up.

42:24.665 --> 42:27.369
So I actually have a book that's listed in this catalog in stock.

42:27.409 --> 42:33.559
That's a nice... Yeah, this came from the Ligonian Library, which is merged with the Library Company of Philadelphia.

42:34.028 --> 42:41.898
Well, when Edwin merged them, Edwin Wolff, he disposed of duplicates.

42:42.739 --> 42:45.303
And this was a duplicate, which is where this came from.

42:45.323 --> 42:48.487
With the book, the book plate alone is pretty spectacular.

42:48.507 --> 42:53.453
I'll tell you a great story about Edwin and serendipitous bibliography, which he was certainly the master of.

42:54.995 --> 42:57.859
When the Franklin Institute sold off a lot of their rare books,

42:58.345 --> 42:59.527
Infamously so.

42:59.547 --> 43:00.188
Infamously so.

43:00.609 --> 43:04.234
And I was very much a participant in that sale.

43:04.315 --> 43:07.059
I mean, they were going to do it, so I had to be there to buy it.

43:08.060 --> 43:10.504
And it was a ridiculous setup.

43:10.564 --> 43:12.648
It was in the basement of the Franklin Institute.

43:13.489 --> 43:17.435
There were shelves that ran up and down the walls.

43:17.576 --> 43:19.078
It was this one big room.

43:19.098 --> 43:19.939
It was like a shotgun.

43:19.959 --> 43:24.066
It was like 100 yards, 100 feet long, and about 20 feet wide.

43:24.856 --> 43:33.007
And they'd arranged the lops and the shelves, like, let's say, lot one was here, lot two was here, across like that, and then back the other way.

43:33.667 --> 43:39.094
So when you were trying to view the stuff, everybody who was looking this way kept running into everybody who was going that way.

43:39.996 --> 43:41.217
And I'd been down there all day.

43:41.237 --> 43:42.639
It's like about four o'clock.

43:42.659 --> 43:43.400
How long ago was this?

43:43.560 --> 43:44.461
Four or five years ago?

43:44.481 --> 43:44.922
I don't know.

43:44.962 --> 43:47.465
This was back in the 80s.

43:47.946 --> 43:48.867
Okay.

43:49.207 --> 43:49.948
I'd forgotten about it.

43:50.149 --> 43:51.050
Late 80s.

43:51.130 --> 43:52.592
And I do a lex-nex search of it.

43:52.972 --> 43:53.513
And, um...

43:53.965 --> 43:56.989
There was a lot of hoopla at the time.

43:57.110 --> 43:59.333
It was late 80s, I think.

44:00.074 --> 44:06.824
So anyway, I'd been there most of the day, and I was going to spend the evening with my friend Byron School, who you probably met, right?

44:06.844 --> 44:07.284
Right.

44:07.304 --> 44:09.988
Yeah, it's one of my closest friends in the wood business.

44:10.008 --> 44:10.589
Very nice band.

44:10.769 --> 44:23.668
And so I was down on the floor looking at the glass shelf, and there's a set of Moxon's Mechanic Exercises, right, which is a very valuable book in and of itself, and of course famous for its place in the history of printing.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.065
And I was looking at this thing, and I was looking at that thing.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.728
You know, the stand rubbing looks familiar.

44:31.329 --> 44:38.739
And I hadn't quite computed at all, and there was a little nudge in my back, a little nudge in my back, and there's Clarence sitting there.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.061
He said, put that back on the shelf.

44:41.063 --> 44:45.268
And I said, Clarence, I'm looking at this thing, and I'm thinking, he said, shut up, I don't say anything.

44:46.270 --> 44:48.393
And so he said, come on, go outside.

44:48.733 --> 44:50.636
And he said, you saw who that was?

44:50.716 --> 44:52.238
I said, yeah, it's Franklin's Coffee.

44:53.804 --> 44:54.826
And he said, that's right.

44:54.846 --> 44:57.189
He said, Edwin's had his eye on that book for 50 years.

44:57.950 --> 44:59.533
I'm buying it for the library company.

44:59.573 --> 45:00.755
You're not going to touch it.

45:02.277 --> 45:03.259
So I said, okay.

45:03.459 --> 45:10.129
And Edwin had known where that book was for 50 years, and he never told anybody.

45:10.169 --> 45:10.310
Wow.

45:10.330 --> 45:11.091
That's Edwin, though.

45:11.151 --> 45:12.613
Now this was happening.

45:13.815 --> 45:15.157
He was dead by this time, right?

45:15.177 --> 45:16.479
No, this is Edwin still alive.

45:16.499 --> 45:18.242
Because I interviewed him about...

45:19.859 --> 45:20.821
Yeah.

45:20.981 --> 45:23.367
Now this is in the late 80s.

45:23.647 --> 45:26.955
Edwin was retired, but he was still alive.

45:27.335 --> 45:29.179
But he wasn't really retired anyway.

45:29.199 --> 45:31.144
He was still alive.

45:31.164 --> 45:33.228
And so I said, okay, okay.

45:33.248 --> 45:35.874
So Clarence said, well, what do you think it's worth?

45:36.736 --> 45:37.678
Franklin's copy.

45:38.079 --> 45:39.522
You know, Mechanical.

45:40.480 --> 45:41.502
Pick a number.

45:41.522 --> 45:47.954
Yeah, I mean, even then, I mean, we were thinking 50, 60,000 bucks, and now I'd say a quarter million, you know.

45:48.015 --> 45:49.117
Jesus Christ.

45:49.678 --> 45:54.507
Well, I mean, just a set of mechanic exercises now is a $25,000 thing.

45:54.527 --> 45:57.433
I mean, you know, Franklin's going to be annotated.

45:57.493 --> 45:58.254
I was marked off.

45:58.315 --> 46:00.038
I mean, Franklin had, like, written it.

46:00.238 --> 46:02.082
You were actually recognizing the handwriting.

46:02.102 --> 46:02.202
Yeah.

46:03.582 --> 46:12.996
Well, it was one of those things where, you know, I was just sitting there and it was just dawning on me like I couldn't believe it, you know, at the point when he came along.

46:13.016 --> 46:19.185
And so I said, you know, what do you, and he said, well, Edwin, you know, Edwin had plenty of money, you know.

46:19.205 --> 46:21.369
And he said, well, Edwin's going to buy it for the library company.

46:21.449 --> 46:23.171
No matter what it costs, I'm going to buy it.

46:24.253 --> 46:26.557
And so we kind of talked about, well, what could that be?

46:26.577 --> 46:30.723
And, you know, he basically, you know, Edwin had told him to go up for fifty grand.

46:30.743 --> 46:32.205
Well, he got it for nine grand.

46:33.097 --> 46:37.203
to the library company.

46:37.304 --> 46:39.808
This is friendship on your part, let me tell you.

46:40.028 --> 46:43.373
Well, you know, I wasn't going to out.

46:43.393 --> 46:45.176
I couldn't out beat him.

46:45.196 --> 46:47.299
Because he was going to 50 if he had to.

46:47.379 --> 46:47.640
Right.

46:48.081 --> 46:50.404
As far as I know, I mean, Clarence and I were the only people who knew.

46:51.105 --> 46:51.947
Well, somebody knew.

46:51.967 --> 46:53.068
Somebody went to 8,500.

46:53.148 --> 46:54.631
But that's what the book was worth.

46:54.651 --> 46:55.051
I see.

46:55.092 --> 46:57.315
The book was worth 8,500 as the book.

46:57.548 --> 47:00.568
So whoever bid against it was bidding on it purely as the book.

47:00.870 --> 47:03.306
And hadn't made any connection

47:03.944 --> 47:08.370
So how did we know it was Franklin's, just by the handwriting?

47:08.471 --> 47:09.913
Well, he also had marks in books.

47:10.053 --> 47:11.134
I mean, Edwin knew all that stuff.

47:11.675 --> 47:12.236
But Edwin knew it.

47:12.256 --> 47:16.101
Of course, he did the book, Franklin's Library, so he would know.

47:16.382 --> 47:16.903
Exactly.

47:17.183 --> 47:17.864
Come to think of it.

47:17.884 --> 47:30.282
And of course, what Edwin had done a long time ago had been to go through a lot of these big collections, which he could do because he knew the people that let him in the bash, and he could just run the shelves, and he knew what typical bindings of Franklin's.

47:30.542 --> 47:33.386
And bindings was a specialty of his as well.

47:33.587 --> 47:33.867
Yeah, exactly.

47:34.117 --> 47:39.442
But no, of course, there's no way I was going to, I mean, I wouldn't have made the case, but I couldn't have successfully.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.666
That's a great book story.

47:43.686 --> 47:47.350
Well, you haven't even talked about it.

47:47.410 --> 47:58.421
I don't think we have time for it now, but I'm also writing about deaccessions and discards and that NYPL thing, but you were more or less an observer on that whole thing, I think, right?

47:58.441 --> 48:00.142
Well, no, I was fairly happy to be involved.

48:00.222 --> 48:02.925
I mean, it was Zinman and I were the ones who really

48:03.293 --> 48:11.142
I mean, he and I were working together the whole way.

48:11.202 --> 48:19.672
I mean, we jointly came up with the idea of the broadside, and we jointly, you know, called in Singer, who's an old friend of both of ours.

48:20.753 --> 48:22.035
So it was very much mutual.

48:22.075 --> 48:26.980
I mean, the books, we knew about it because some of the books were coming to Michael, but also coming to me.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.866
I mean, the fact that they had resumed doing it, we knew because the Book Scouts were bringing them to me.

48:32.487 --> 48:47.241
And they'd actually made a deal, not an official deal, but a handshake deal with AAS, that if they deaccessioned stuff before 1876, they'd give AAS first shot at having the stuff.

48:47.261 --> 48:51.284
And specifically what they were getting rid of, like, there was this run of Florida Session Laws.

48:52.085 --> 48:59.372
It's the only known complete run of Florida Session Laws in the 1820s, and there's very little Florida surviving printing from that period, because it was all eaten by bugs.

49:00.112 --> 49:02.494
And, I mean, AAS had like one thing in it.

49:03.235 --> 49:10.322
And his book scout shows up at my door, and he's got all these things, and it's been guillotined out of the bindings with the filming slips out, you know, and the data when they were filmed.

49:11.263 --> 49:13.685
And, you know, they'd sold it to him for nothing.

49:14.706 --> 49:15.387
And where did it go?

49:15.567 --> 49:18.030
I mean, does AAS, did they get it finally, or is it—?

49:18.050 --> 49:19.431
I gave it to him.

49:19.451 --> 49:20.712
So you got it and gave it to AAS.

49:20.732 --> 49:22.694
Yeah, I paid the book scout a fair bit of money for it.

49:23.135 --> 49:25.377
But then I called up Ellen, and I said, Ellen, you know,

49:25.627 --> 49:28.251
We're supposed to have a deal with these bozos, you know.

49:28.271 --> 49:29.893
They said they were going to give A.S.

49:29.933 --> 49:31.215
first crack.

49:31.235 --> 49:37.064
Ellen called, and this is, you know, don't say the specific part of it.

49:37.084 --> 49:40.469
Well, let me just tape it for my own, just so I know, so I can hear it, yeah.

49:40.750 --> 49:45.897
But, I mean, basically she called up Bill Walker, who said, oh no, we're not deaccessioning anything.

49:46.038 --> 49:51.266
I mean, I'm sitting here with the stuff in my living room floor, you know, and he's saying, oh no, never let any of it out.

49:51.967 --> 49:54.891
And so Ellen said, well, you know, actually,

49:55.495 --> 50:00.181
I know you have, because one of our trustees, you know, has... Came in possession.

50:00.201 --> 50:01.823
Came in possession of stuff just now.

50:02.243 --> 50:04.426
Oh, it must have been out of the old batch and stuff.

50:04.446 --> 50:05.867
Yeah, it's got things in it filmed.

50:06.148 --> 50:06.809
Walker should know.

50:06.989 --> 50:14.358
And I, you know, we really tried, my client did, to talk to them.

50:14.378 --> 50:19.624
You know, we tried via Ellen talking to them and Ellen getting stonewalled.

50:20.545 --> 50:24.149
And I tried, you know, I wrote LeClerc.

50:24.169 --> 50:24.810
He ignored me.

50:25.297 --> 50:25.718
Why?

50:26.038 --> 50:28.943
And so Michael and I finally just got really fed up.

50:29.043 --> 50:32.308
I mean, it was this—and my context for this, you know, went way back.

50:32.368 --> 50:44.907
I mean, I'd been involved with them with this back in the early 80s, and I'd had this big fight with them when Gregorian was there, because stuff was showing up that had been deaccessioned from them, including things that were unique copies.

50:45.368 --> 50:46.670
They had the only known copy.

50:47.411 --> 50:51.557
And so I called up—actually, I got one in my hands, I looked it up, it's the only known copy.

50:52.094 --> 50:53.315
And I called David Stam.

50:53.435 --> 50:54.977
Can you think of what it might be, the only one?

50:54.997 --> 51:04.707
Yeah, it was a pamphlet relating to the—after the Republic of Texas ended, there was a whole problem about how to absorb the armed forces of Texas into the U.S.

51:04.767 --> 51:10.793
armed forces, what rank people would have, would they continue with their rank, would they be kept at all.

51:11.694 --> 51:13.296
And this was particularly the problem with the Navy.

51:14.497 --> 51:17.460
And the guy who had been Commodore of the Texas Navy was very

51:17.609 --> 51:20.772
you know, pissed off that he wasn't going to get to be a Commodore or whatever.

51:20.792 --> 51:22.754
And he wrote a whole bunch of pamphlets about this.

51:23.514 --> 51:24.695
This is one of those pamphlets.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.377
I bought it at the Litchfield Book Fair.

51:26.877 --> 51:28.059
It's $250.

51:28.339 --> 51:30.621
I bring it back down, I look it up, one copy in it.

51:31.922 --> 51:32.743
I thought it was stolen.

51:32.843 --> 51:34.044
I mean, it had their stamp on it.

51:34.344 --> 51:35.806
It had come from them, clearly.

51:35.886 --> 51:37.067
And it's the only known copy.

51:37.087 --> 51:38.048
I mean, he wouldn't get rid of it.

51:38.208 --> 51:39.929
I called up, I called up David Stan.

51:39.949 --> 51:41.611
So Stan was still at NYPL then?

51:41.671 --> 51:42.552
Yeah, David was still there.

51:43.693 --> 51:46.215
And I called up David, and I said, David, I think I've got something stolen.

51:46.550 --> 51:52.577
and I told them what it was, and it's kind of, well, actually, you know, we deaccessioned that.

51:52.797 --> 51:53.498
It's like, you what?

51:53.918 --> 51:58.924
Well, it turned out they'd taken the whole Ford collection, you know, Worthington, Chauncey, or Paul Lester Ford.

51:59.264 --> 52:03.348
Ford's gave New York Public Library like 100,000 pamphlets.

52:03.368 --> 52:04.790
They're all bound up in volume.

52:05.411 --> 52:07.873
And they took the whole Ford collection and they chopped it out.

52:08.634 --> 52:09.695
And some of it they kept.

52:09.736 --> 52:13.880
Some of it they gave away, which at least put it in libraries that cared about it.

52:14.541 --> 52:15.662
And some of it they discarded.

52:15.946 --> 52:17.869
They sold it for next to nothing.

52:17.909 --> 52:19.211
Did they microfilm it at least?

52:19.291 --> 52:20.112
No, they filmed it all.

52:20.292 --> 52:21.113
They filmed it all.

52:21.133 --> 52:23.977
No, they did film it all.

52:23.997 --> 52:28.484
So we'd had a fight about it back then, and I'd made this big stink about it.

52:28.604 --> 52:33.932
And they were going, oh, you know, they're kind of, at that point they said, well, we're finished anyway.

52:33.952 --> 52:35.414
We've done the program we're going to do.

52:35.494 --> 52:37.537
So, you know, there's nothing else.

52:38.078 --> 52:44.046
Then they wanted me to, this is a longstanding story point, story point between David Stan and Bill Joyce, who was also there, and me.

52:44.532 --> 52:48.837
They wanted me to write them a letter saying they'd explained it all to me, and I understood and approved what they did.

52:48.877 --> 52:51.000
I said, I'm not going to do that.

52:51.020 --> 52:52.942
The military is covering my ass with paper.

52:53.963 --> 52:54.123
Exactly.

52:54.143 --> 52:55.645
That's exactly what they're trying to do.

52:55.665 --> 52:56.767
But it seemed to be the end of it.

52:58.168 --> 53:00.431
Well, then it turned out it wasn't the end of it.

53:01.432 --> 53:03.675
You know, suddenly this stuff's going on again.

53:04.776 --> 53:08.981
And so basically, I mean, we tried to do it through official channels.

53:10.183 --> 53:11.845
And, you know, we had pretty good access.

53:11.865 --> 53:12.646
Over a period of years.

53:13.106 --> 53:13.847
Yeah, well, I thought...

53:14.080 --> 53:15.762
You know, it was all over and done with then.

53:15.802 --> 53:23.373
But, I mean, when it came up again in 97, 98, you know, I knew these guys.

53:23.994 --> 53:26.837
You know, and they were, and Ellen, obviously, was a very close colleague.

53:26.898 --> 53:28.960
Bill Walker, he's just stonewalling her about it.

53:29.061 --> 53:32.345
I mean, so we just got pissed off.

53:32.365 --> 53:35.069
I mean, I just thought, screw it, I don't care.

53:35.289 --> 53:43.260
You know, I mean, I'm not going to, because my whole view was that it's one thing if you're like the, you know,

53:43.662 --> 53:52.913
Bohunk Historical Society or if you're a relatively small college library somewhere, you tailor your collection to what your constituency needs in that case.

53:53.173 --> 53:54.094
That's your obligation.

53:54.775 --> 54:13.197
But if you're a great research library, if you're the Library of Congress or New York Public or Yale or Harvard or Stanford, you're one of the great research libraries in the world, you have an obligation to protect the material you have because only a limited number of repositories have those kinds of resources.

54:13.312 --> 54:15.835
and can have that kind of universal view.

54:16.115 --> 54:22.984
And it's doubly important for those institutions to play their role as these great central repositories.

54:23.644 --> 54:28.150
And to me, the New York Public Library was violating what it was going out.

54:28.310 --> 54:36.400
You know, if you read, they were going out raising hundreds of millions of dollars saying to the people who are giving them the money, we have a universal scope.

54:36.420 --> 54:37.801
You know, we're a great research library.

54:37.822 --> 54:39.944
We're preserving the world's resources.

54:39.984 --> 54:42.407
Well, great, they should.

54:42.775 --> 54:43.957
But they weren't really doing that.

54:44.618 --> 54:52.389
The argument in response, it's not my argument, I just present it, because it feeds into this whole preservation argument.

54:52.449 --> 55:06.809
They would argue, and they would argue, because I've talked to Joyce and Stan on this, and they say, well, you know, there was an argument that by microfilming you're preserving the information, and that in these cases it's the information that matters and not the artifact.

55:06.969 --> 55:08.191
What's your response to that?

55:08.271 --> 55:12.597
Well, my response to that is that there are instances where they're right,

55:13.235 --> 55:20.763
When you get into the era of very friable paper, you get into... They had a bunch of World War I newspapers, for instance.

55:21.404 --> 55:22.725
They were literally falling apart.

55:23.206 --> 55:24.487
They were going to fall apart.

55:24.667 --> 55:26.429
You know, they only hadn't fallen apart.

55:26.489 --> 55:28.552
They might have one turn of the page left.

55:28.572 --> 55:29.533
Yeah, exactly.

55:30.113 --> 55:32.215
And I completely agreed with them on that stuff.

55:32.276 --> 55:36.760
There was no reason, there's every reason to film that stuff, and they were completely right there.

55:36.780 --> 55:41.105
But that was a small fraction of what they were filming.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.887
These early Florida things, for instance,

55:43.289 --> 55:44.771
These were printed on quite good paper.

55:44.831 --> 55:46.152
They were in good physical condition.

55:46.213 --> 55:49.176
Even after being chopped out of the bindings, they were in, you know, perfectly good shape.

55:49.196 --> 55:50.658
And they're damn close to being unique.

55:51.098 --> 55:52.901
Damn close to being unique, exactly.

55:53.481 --> 56:05.335
Their further argument, you know, Paul Leclerc's argument, is that, well, the microfilm is going to allow them to disseminate this material and other places can have it.

56:05.796 --> 56:10.782
I mean, my response to that has always been, fine, microfilm it, but don't get rid of the original.

56:11.521 --> 56:14.165
You don't even have to make the original accessible on a shelf anymore.

56:14.405 --> 56:25.923
Get a warehouse in New Jersey, put it in box $2,555, ship it out there, and if somebody has to see the original, charge them a $50 fee or something for hauling it back in.

56:26.443 --> 56:27.826
But you've still got the original.

56:28.747 --> 56:32.052
Once you film it, then it's all over with.

56:32.272 --> 56:34.075
Once you've thrown it out, it's all over with.

56:34.215 --> 56:36.539
Nobody can go back to the original thing.

56:37.901 --> 56:39.583
Do you know the story of the Italian newspapers?

56:39.984 --> 56:40.144
Nope.

56:40.968 --> 56:41.448
Okay.

56:41.509 --> 56:43.010
This is a good story.

56:45.412 --> 56:46.113
You got enough paper?

56:46.133 --> 56:46.453
Oh, yeah.

56:46.473 --> 56:46.854
Don't worry.

56:46.874 --> 56:47.855
This is the whole other side.

56:50.457 --> 56:54.982
Michael, you know, had ended up buying the remnants of what had been thrown out in the early 80s.

56:55.022 --> 56:57.524
That was the New York Public Library stuff Michael got.

56:58.385 --> 57:00.187
So Michael starts digging through this stuff.

57:00.207 --> 57:01.008
And I came down.

57:01.068 --> 57:03.270
I spent the better part of the day digging with him.

57:03.410 --> 57:04.711
This is at his place.

57:04.871 --> 57:05.452
At his place.

57:06.113 --> 57:10.637
So we pull out this Italian algebra book.

57:11.798 --> 57:14.743
It's printed in Fort Missoula, Montana.

57:17.006 --> 57:24.318
And, except on the cover, it's got, like, the fascist, the fassies, the axes and the bundled sticks.

57:24.338 --> 57:24.458
Right.

57:24.839 --> 57:25.840
It's on the back of the dime.

57:25.961 --> 57:31.730
And is dated, you know, XXII, which is fascist dating from here Mussolini took power.

57:31.790 --> 57:32.611
It's like 1943, right?

57:32.691 --> 57:34.614
He took power in 21.

57:35.856 --> 57:36.237
And...

57:36.959 --> 57:40.704
Missoula, Montana, 1943, an Italian algebra book.

57:40.824 --> 57:44.690
And we sat there and, like, literally kind of, what is this?

57:44.850 --> 57:46.112
You know, it made no sense.

57:47.093 --> 57:49.256
And we kind of idly speculated, and then we continued.

57:49.957 --> 57:51.500
Ten days later, I'm reading the New York Times.

57:53.002 --> 57:58.950
And there's an article in the New York Times about how Italian-Americans are now beginning to protest.

57:59.605 --> 58:14.083
in the same way that the Japanese Americans protested about how they were treated during World War II, about how good American citizens who just happened to be of Italian heritage were interned and treated badly in America.

58:14.103 --> 58:15.184
We interned some Italians?

58:15.244 --> 58:15.805
Yeah, yeah.

58:15.825 --> 58:17.687
We had Italian concentration camps.

58:18.548 --> 58:22.593
And, you know, they all wanted to get a settlement, just like the Japanese had gotten.

58:22.613 --> 58:23.475
Very interesting.

58:23.675 --> 58:24.816
I can see where you're going with this.

58:24.836 --> 58:29.562
They had a picture of one of the chief internment camps, which was in Fort Missoula, Montana.

58:30.149 --> 58:32.755
And I called Michael up, I said, Michael, do you see the story in the Times?

58:32.916 --> 58:33.657
And he said, no.

58:33.677 --> 58:34.980
And he got the Times.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.263
And he said, yeah, I said, what about it?

58:36.283 --> 58:38.709
And I said, well, that's regardless.

58:38.729 --> 58:40.674
And he goes, oh, okay.

58:40.694 --> 58:42.618
Yeah, he said, well, okay, yeah, well, so what?

58:42.638 --> 58:44.142
And I said, well, so what?

58:44.712 --> 58:49.678
The goddamn cover has the Fassies and axes on it and Mussolini's date.

58:49.999 --> 58:52.161
And these people are claiming they were good Americans.

58:52.181 --> 58:57.047
You know, if they were good Americans, they would have had 1943.

58:57.087 --> 59:00.211
Yeah, they wouldn't have the comparable swastika.

59:00.472 --> 59:01.032
Yeah, exactly.

59:01.173 --> 59:04.016
So he says, Jesus Christ.

59:04.076 --> 59:06.279
So he calls up the Times.

59:06.479 --> 59:07.460
And he says, guess what I've got.

59:07.480 --> 59:08.261
Guess what I've got.

59:08.822 --> 59:13.588
And so the Times says, you know, well, where can we see it?

59:14.446 --> 59:18.610
And Michael says, New York Public Library, they've got a microfilm.

59:18.630 --> 59:21.152
So they send somebody over to the New York Public Library.

59:21.172 --> 59:23.254
They call Michael back in two hours.

59:23.294 --> 59:25.716
They say, we don't know what you're talking about.

59:25.756 --> 59:30.681
They've got the book, they've got the Italian thing, but they don't have those covers you're talking about.

59:30.701 --> 59:32.383
Of course, they didn't film the covers.

59:32.403 --> 59:33.223
They didn't film the covers.

59:34.084 --> 59:35.946
And Michael said, well, I've got the originals right here.

59:36.166 --> 59:36.566
You see?

59:36.807 --> 59:38.708
And they said, well, you know, bring them down.

59:38.748 --> 59:39.469
That's the story.

59:39.549 --> 59:41.311
And Michael said, I want to write a letter to the Times.

59:41.331 --> 59:43.693
They said, you bring them down, and we can prove it.

59:44.652 --> 59:46.435
Did the Times reprint it?

59:46.675 --> 59:48.077
Yeah, the Times ran the story.

59:48.097 --> 59:48.418
Did they?

59:48.458 --> 59:49.079
They ran the letter.

59:49.239 --> 59:51.082
But they were saying to Michael— Who wrote the letter?

59:51.422 --> 59:51.703
Michael.

59:51.903 --> 59:52.985
So it was a Zinman letter.

59:53.065 --> 59:53.586
A Zinman letter.

59:53.606 --> 59:54.327
I'll do a search for it.

59:54.347 --> 59:55.448
I'll do a Lexnex search for it.

59:55.468 --> 59:56.089
It's a Zinman letter.

59:56.831 --> 01:00:09.630
And, of course, without the—what the Times printer said was, we don't—you know, we can't accept microfilm

01:00:10.623 --> 01:00:12.786
I think even what was there... The Times says this?

01:00:13.146 --> 01:00:15.610
Well, I've got a story for you when you're done with this.

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:23.560
Inside, there were more... The covers weren't there, but there was some kind of fascistic emblems on the inside, so they could see what Michael was talking about.

01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:27.966
But the Times further said, we're not comfortable with microfilm.

01:00:28.307 --> 01:00:35.857
We run your letter, there'll be a big stink in the Italian-American community, they'll be all pissed off, we want to see hard copies.

01:00:35.917 --> 01:00:36.858
The Times said this.

01:00:37.039 --> 01:00:39.862
The Times said this to Michael.

01:00:39.882 --> 01:00:40.343
Now...

01:00:40.441 --> 01:00:43.604
The Times, I think, accepts microfilm as evidence.

01:00:43.624 --> 01:00:46.948
But in this case, they're going to make a political decision here.

01:00:47.028 --> 01:00:50.432
They're running something they think is going to piss off the Italian-American community.

01:00:50.512 --> 01:00:52.714
How many million Italians in New York?

01:00:52.734 --> 01:00:53.755
They want hard copy.

01:00:55.397 --> 01:01:03.526
Jean Ashton, when I was at the Grollier dinner, either this year or the year before, and we're chatting, and she's telling me about medium rare, which I think is cute.

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:07.090
And then she says, you know, we're talking about preservation, we're talking about the...

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:10.413
I forget how we went, but I'm writing all this down in my notebook.

01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:18.624
And she said, you know, from—she forgets the years, but I have since— They wanted—they were going to run a letter.

01:01:18.644 --> 01:01:20.046
They thought it was going to be controversial.

01:01:20.587 --> 01:01:22.069
The reporter wanted hard copy.

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:29.419
He wanted to see— Yeah, but their own policy, it's kind of hypocritical, isn't it, where their own policy says microfilm is good?

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:34.866
That is kind of hypocritical, but, you know, you could say it's also just a good reporter being sure of the story.

01:01:36.584 --> 01:01:38.687
So the story did finally run.

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:40.250
Oh, they ran Michael's letter.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:41.652
They ran the letter.

01:01:41.672 --> 01:01:41.852
Oh, yeah.

01:01:41.873 --> 01:01:48.223
And Michael, being Michael, jumped in his pickup truck and drove down to the Times building and walked in with it.

01:01:48.784 --> 01:01:57.958
So anyway, I mean, ultimately, we basically just took the decision that we didn't care.

01:01:58.419 --> 01:01:59.841
We were going to do this.

01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:03.908
And we also had a friend on the board.

01:02:05.204 --> 01:02:11.815
We had a number of friends on the board, actually, but one specific friend on the board gave us the home addresses of the other trustees.

01:02:12.436 --> 01:02:15.501
So a copy of the Zinman broadside went to all those people.

01:02:16.582 --> 01:02:22.312
And suddenly, Singer's story came out, Michael's broadside hit, and suddenly we got some action.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.417
I did an interview with Robert Darnton a couple months ago.

01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:26.719
He's one of the trustees.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.203
He's a terrific interviewer, great guy.

01:02:29.223 --> 01:02:30.705
And then I said to him,

01:02:31.327 --> 01:02:33.349
And this is before I'd been talking to Michael about this.

01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:36.112
And he said, there's one thing I told Paul.

01:02:37.173 --> 01:02:39.016
I will not tolerate guillotining.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.899
I said, where is he getting this jargon, you know?

01:02:41.919 --> 01:02:46.824
He must have been getting the—and so I understand they've come up now with a policy.

01:02:47.545 --> 01:02:48.286
So I gather.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:51.790
I mean, you know— And LeClaire says it's not going to happen again.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:52.711
Right, right.

01:02:52.731 --> 01:02:53.211
And we'll see.

01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:54.072
I'm going to call Paul.

01:02:54.373 --> 01:02:55.714
I mean, Paul—

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.965
Paul and I have met a number of occasions.

01:03:00.045 --> 01:03:03.328
I met with Paul immediately after the story came out.

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:08.114
Is the thing smoothed over between you and he?

01:03:08.174 --> 01:03:11.978
I like to think things weren't particularly rough between him and me.

01:03:12.058 --> 01:03:14.181
I explained to him why we did it.

01:03:14.241 --> 01:03:15.742
He's not going to get upset.

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:19.687
When that story hit, I wrote him a letter.

01:03:20.428 --> 01:03:25.093
I said, look, this is why we did this.

01:03:25.478 --> 01:03:27.684
I'd be happy to talk to you about it.

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:36.467
I'd be happy to tell you from my point of view, as somebody in the trade, and as somebody who's the trustee of a large research library,

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.434
Why the artifact is important.

01:03:39.454 --> 01:03:40.575
Why the artifact is important.

01:03:40.595 --> 01:03:45.542
And I met and had a very cultural conversation with him, and I don't think that he was aware that this was going on.

01:03:45.562 --> 01:03:46.983
I mean, he hadn't been in charge that long.

01:03:47.004 --> 01:03:48.505
Well, it happened, it started back in the 70s.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:49.947
Yeah, it was a huge organization.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:52.431
I mean, in a way, these things are self-fulfilling prophecies.

01:03:52.451 --> 01:03:53.973
This is funded by federal funds.

01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:57.477
They got the money to do the microfilming, the money's sitting there, you know.

01:03:57.777 --> 01:04:01.203
And I think he genuinely wanted it to stop.

01:04:01.443 --> 01:04:04.829
By the time I talked to him, he genuinely wanted it to stop for two reasons.

01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:07.814
I mean, one, I'd like to think it's because he didn't think it should happen.

01:04:08.255 --> 01:04:11.400
Two, was it become an extraordinary... The ink is bad, yeah.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.963
It's very bad ink.

01:04:13.223 --> 01:04:15.988
But I felt like that's, in the end, what it took.

01:04:16.222 --> 01:04:20.706
And that's what it took to bring it to his attention, for that matter.

01:04:20.926 --> 01:04:22.388
You know, to really kind of cut through.

01:04:22.408 --> 01:04:23.729
Nothing happens in a vacuum.

01:04:23.969 --> 01:04:24.469
Yeah.

01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:25.690
Never has, never will.

01:04:25.791 --> 01:04:32.196
So, I mean, Michael and I very consciously planned our little, um, our rig.

01:04:32.316 --> 01:04:33.117
Well, and it worked.

01:04:33.658 --> 01:04:34.899
Congratulations.

01:04:34.919 --> 01:04:36.360
I mean, I'm writing about it.

01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:41.565
You know, I'm not going to go into the, because I've got a lot of instances of discarded.

01:04:41.585 --> 01:04:42.305
That's it.

01:04:42.325 --> 01:04:43.687
Because they were not any longer.

01:04:44.227 --> 01:04:45.368
And that their whole...

01:04:46.428 --> 01:04:50.533
that they were very proud, trusted proud that they were not any library.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:56.920
They were the New York Public Library, and that they should have been holding themselves to a higher standard.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:13.980
Well, they just announced last week that this woman, Patricia Batten, she's getting a National Medal of whatever, and she's honoring her effort for leading the charge to preserve on Michael's phone.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:14.140
Uh-huh.

01:05:15.217 --> 01:05:17.522
You know, her preservation thing is a microfilm thing.

01:05:18.204 --> 01:05:19.607
Well, I don't have it, as I said.

01:05:19.647 --> 01:05:29.591
Yeah, but my point is, I wonder if these people know that we do preserve an essential step in this process of the dilatine.

01:05:29.611 --> 01:05:32.297
Well, they do throw things away.

01:05:32.699 --> 01:05:36.843
But as I said, I mean, in this case, the artifacts were not destroyed.

01:05:36.903 --> 01:05:39.386
I mean, they were perfectly intact.

01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:40.387
They were just sliced?

01:05:40.427 --> 01:05:41.248
They were just sliced.

01:05:41.288 --> 01:05:43.029
They had been stuck back in the bindings.

01:05:43.229 --> 01:05:44.631
They're all at AAS now.

01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:46.933
I mean, this is the stacks down here.

01:05:47.113 --> 01:05:47.374
Oh.

01:05:47.594 --> 01:05:52.699
But this is, as I said, the bulk of the shelving is out at the warehouse, that's where.

01:05:52.719 --> 01:05:56.182
But we've got half a mile between these two buildings.

01:05:56.723 --> 01:06:01.828
So that's the downtown part of the operation.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:10.652
But, you know, even if it meant just sticking the stuff in a box, you still have it.

01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:12.935
I don't think they wanted to be bothered, though.

01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:15.278
Yeah, I know they didn't want to be bothered.

01:06:15.299 --> 01:06:17.422
And David has as much as told me that, too.

01:06:18.403 --> 01:06:23.290
The cost involved in giving somebody something is more than throwing it away.

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:28.778
Yeah, well, I also said to them,

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:37.282
You know, even if they didn't want to keep it, I mean, that seemed to be the other point.

01:06:37.302 --> 01:06:37.842
Right.

01:06:37.862 --> 01:06:42.648
That AAS is sitting there saying, you know, we'll come take it away.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:48.154
And, you know, they had to at least get it to the loading dock.

01:06:48.675 --> 01:06:54.602
You know, they had to at least get it to the loading dock.

01:06:54.622 --> 01:07:02.050
And if they got it to the loading dock, they could as easily load it into an AAS truck as anybody else's truck.

01:07:02.371 --> 01:07:03.372
I think that's...

01:07:04.347 --> 01:07:05.188
I like David.

01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:06.269
He's a hell of a nice guy.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:11.113
And this is a very embarrassing thing for them.

01:07:11.554 --> 01:07:12.515
The David stamp.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:12.995
Yeah.

01:07:13.135 --> 01:07:13.536
Yeah.

01:07:13.556 --> 01:07:20.863
Well, David and I have been, you know, disagreeing on this from then to now, and nothing's changed.

01:07:20.943 --> 01:07:27.009
I mean, I think David's a nice guy, and I think he's, you know, basically a great professional, but, you know.

01:07:27.189 --> 01:07:28.070
He was wrong on this.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.232
But Bill was part of this, too, you know?

01:07:31.533 --> 01:07:32.314
Want some altruids?

01:07:32.394 --> 01:07:32.734
No, no.

01:07:34.132 --> 01:07:35.030
I think I've got it.
