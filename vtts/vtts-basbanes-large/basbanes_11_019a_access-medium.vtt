WEBVTT

00:03.372 --> 00:06.177
Dr. Alvarello.

00:06.377 --> 00:07.179
Dr. Alvarello.

00:07.299 --> 00:19.620
I worked with Mirella Ferrari at the University of Milano.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.425
We can buy this on the way out when we're done.

00:22.505 --> 00:23.086
Yes.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.612
If you want to see some reproductions.

00:27.453 --> 00:37.989
Tell us a little bit, this is the original library?

00:38.009 --> 00:54.034
No, this is the library built in the 18th century, when the library becomes public, and not only for the chapter canonically, you know?

00:54.250 --> 01:22.637
in latin is canonici the chapter capitulus is the priest just for the priest of the cathedral and in the 18th century so the library became public there is an original because in the second worm there you could

01:23.056 --> 01:24.538
You could write it out.

01:24.798 --> 01:31.426
Okay, the treasures.

01:31.486 --> 01:33.128
Doctor, can I just see?

01:33.148 --> 01:34.390
Petrarca has a scholar here.

01:35.771 --> 01:36.512
Another scholar.

01:37.153 --> 01:39.636
Petrarca, yeah.

01:39.656 --> 01:41.458
They had letters by Cisco here.

01:44.061 --> 01:44.842
My goodness.

01:45.022 --> 01:52.251
No, the books of Petrarca went to Europe, to Milano, and someone in Ambrosiana.

01:52.271 --> 01:52.371
Okay.

01:52.975 --> 02:20.434
all of the 18th centuries the original library here in this spot no no the 18th library was near to the cathedral and only about the 18th century the books comes

02:20.903 --> 02:21.844
They're coming here.

02:22.645 --> 02:24.828
Thank you.

02:24.968 --> 02:30.896
The ancient words in Italian.

02:30.916 --> 02:34.141
The ancient is in Dovinello Veronese.

02:34.942 --> 02:35.743
Okay?

02:37.325 --> 02:42.973
It's written in Moldarabicus Corpus of Oraciones.

02:42.993 --> 02:45.836
And this is in... Okay.

02:47.779 --> 02:50.843
Famous regions, se pareba boves, alba patraglia,

02:51.093 --> 03:00.263
It's the first record of Italian language in the 90th century.

03:02.446 --> 03:06.591
How many writings are in this library, in this collection?

03:07.712 --> 03:17.343
The library here is famous for the parchment books, not for the printed books.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.125
The printed books

03:19.797 --> 03:26.327
We think that came from the library of Scipione Maffei.

03:27.168 --> 03:28.049
You mean the manuscript?

03:28.229 --> 03:28.710
Yes.

03:30.973 --> 03:47.938
As Bishop and Lo say, this is the more ancient library in the world because we have a manuscript with the date of subscription.

03:48.239 --> 03:49.180
And what date is that?

03:49.649 --> 03:55.642
The manuscript is the colophon in the last part of the manuscript.

03:55.902 --> 04:03.118
The script wrote explicit vita beati paulini nomensi.

04:03.436 --> 04:29.455
Monati Tebei, per scriptus, the books are written by Subconsulatus, at the name of the Agapitus Consul, by Ursicinus, scriptal writer.

04:29.475 --> 04:29.775
Yes.

04:29.795 --> 04:31.738
Which is very unusual.

04:32.191 --> 04:38.677
The year is 517?

04:38.997 --> 04:49.126
No, but he don't write 817, right?

04:49.566 --> 04:56.472
I wrote this manuscript at the time of Agapito, the Consul Agapito.

04:56.552 --> 05:01.877
And so we know that Agapito were in Verona.

05:02.296 --> 05:03.097
Is that in English?

05:03.117 --> 05:04.840
Can I write down some of that?

05:05.481 --> 05:05.741
Yeah, yeah.

05:05.821 --> 05:06.582
That's magnificent.

05:06.782 --> 05:08.164
And it was here in Verona too?

05:08.285 --> 05:08.565
Yes.

05:08.925 --> 05:13.252
That's what's amazing about it.

05:13.452 --> 05:27.291
You could read the Love, Codices, Latini Antiquioris, the volume 5.

05:27.812 --> 05:28.253
I see.

05:29.535 --> 05:31.898
The manuscript from Verona, would you say?

05:32.620 --> 05:40.168
Some manuscript was written in Verona and some from the other country of Europe.

05:41.290 --> 06:02.593
The Siglo d'Or, the most important time for the scriptorium in Verona, was the 19th century, because at Verona came two Carolingian bishops from Reichenau, the Costanza lake.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.691
Okay.

06:04.971 --> 06:19.546
There was a monastery where it was about also Valafredo Stabono and pupil of Rabanomaurus that was the most important in Carolingian Europe.

06:20.227 --> 06:32.800
And so we have many manuscripts that came in Verona and also that by Verona go to other Europe.

06:32.948 --> 06:38.927
You could read an important essay of Claudia Villa.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.796
Claudia Villa.

06:41.876 --> 06:46.350
Yes, Claudia.

06:47.005 --> 06:51.529
Deutsch better than Italian?

06:51.630 --> 06:52.010
No.

06:52.130 --> 06:54.452
Better than Italian, actually.

06:54.633 --> 06:59.417
No, because this essay has been translated in Germany.

06:59.738 --> 07:04.843
Oh, maybe if I ever could do that.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.446
In the review.

07:08.807 --> 07:16.354
Okay.

07:17.245 --> 07:18.046
What come here?

07:18.466 --> 07:19.767
How was it collected?

07:19.827 --> 07:21.429
Why did it come to Verona?

07:21.769 --> 07:23.471
To the Spicciolati Library.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.112
Were they purchased or were they given?

07:25.913 --> 07:26.894
I don't understand.

07:26.934 --> 07:27.634
Were they bought?

07:28.655 --> 07:29.156
The books?

07:29.176 --> 07:29.456
Yes.

07:30.057 --> 07:46.932
But in the Carolingian period, medieval age, there was normal that the different library, church, or monasteries have some relations and exchange from copy

07:47.047 --> 07:48.329
from copy book.

07:48.349 --> 07:54.116
So these basically, when this was copied... This was copied in Verona.

07:54.196 --> 07:56.620
And see this is, they did it for themselves.

07:56.740 --> 08:07.694
It is the only books in all the world that we have, that we can date with precision.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.236
Date with precision.

08:09.457 --> 08:09.977
The only.

08:10.678 --> 08:15.805
Because we have ancient book that Virgilius Latino,

08:15.970 --> 08:19.555
Virgilio Sambrosianos in this library also.

08:19.956 --> 08:24.362
But this is the one that we can date with precision.

08:26.786 --> 08:29.570
Where was the scriptorium in Verona?

08:29.590 --> 08:30.692
You said the scriptorium.

08:30.732 --> 08:31.333
Was it here?

08:31.393 --> 08:34.958
Was there a scriptorium here in Verona where they did the copying?

08:34.978 --> 08:35.419
Yes.

08:35.439 --> 08:35.759
Right here?

08:35.920 --> 08:36.260
Yes.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.802
In this spot?

08:37.822 --> 08:39.565
Not in this.

08:40.017 --> 08:45.163
Not here, we don't know where, but near the cathedral.

08:45.243 --> 08:45.964
Near the cathedral.

08:46.565 --> 08:47.426
What was he writing?

08:47.967 --> 08:50.610
What is the subject here?

08:50.650 --> 09:03.046
The subject is the Vita Sulpici Severi, the life of Sulpicius Severo, no, the life of Martino, St.

09:03.146 --> 09:09.113
Martino of Tours, written by Sulpicius Severo.

09:09.532 --> 09:33.340
Italiopuscola, italiopuscola, that means that there is written other words like the Vita of the Paulus monk.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.222
Now is he copying this or did he write it?

09:35.482 --> 09:35.763
Yes.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.885
He's copying this from earlier.

09:38.017 --> 10:04.277
earlier from an earlier manuscript which is now gone probably so this was done here in verona yes he copied it and it went from there directly into this collection do you think that's what's fantastic about this 1800 years we can we can tell that in verona at this time there was a library production yes that's just magnificent about it extraordinary

10:04.915 --> 10:06.077
1800 years.

10:06.477 --> 10:08.721
That's what's fantastic about it.

10:08.741 --> 10:21.119
But after the 90th century, the library becomes less important.

10:22.381 --> 10:23.683
For Verona,

10:23.849 --> 10:28.196
The most important period is the carolingian production.

10:28.496 --> 10:30.479
Should we do this now or when we come back?

10:30.519 --> 10:31.481
Yes, yes.

10:31.961 --> 10:39.172
And also there is a bibliography full of Claudia Villa.

10:39.192 --> 10:40.594
Oh, yes, the bibliography.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.519
Claudia Villa, La Transitione du Arte.

10:44.601 --> 10:47.545
The informative stage of the classical tradition.

10:47.609 --> 10:50.414
Why don't we get these now so we don't have to come back here?

10:50.434 --> 10:52.076
Can we repay these downstairs?

10:53.098 --> 10:55.182
Should we come back and take them?

10:55.262 --> 10:57.425
Do you want me to take them now, Doctor?

10:57.946 --> 11:00.030
No, we'll come back, so we don't have to carry them.

11:00.591 --> 11:01.813
We don't have to carry them with us.

11:02.674 --> 11:03.295
It's wonderful.

11:06.460 --> 11:12.891
Salone of Reviva Salone for conference.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.197
Not to consult, not to read a book.

11:16.437 --> 11:17.159
Not to read.

11:17.179 --> 11:18.001
Not to read a book.

11:18.622 --> 11:18.943
Okay.

11:18.963 --> 11:23.212
Oh, the health conference?

11:23.233 --> 11:23.473
Okay.

11:23.533 --> 11:24.014
Not a reading.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.277
It's not a reading one.

11:27.383 --> 11:41.912
I made a course of post degree at the University of Cassino and I am in concert with the Guillermo Cavallo, you know?

11:42.794 --> 11:48.666
In Italy I think this is the big teacher

11:49.000 --> 11:51.483
He's a teacher.

11:51.623 --> 11:54.226
He writes many, many essays.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.389
Yes, yes, of course, yes.

11:56.409 --> 11:57.490
He teaches art at Rome.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.275
But I study at Milano with Mirella Ferrari.

12:01.755 --> 12:09.464
She's translated by the English, many books about the classical tradition, manuscripts, paragraph, or paragraph.

12:09.484 --> 12:10.766
She speaks, yes.

12:11.086 --> 12:16.012
You know, Reynolds, scribes, scribes.

12:16.693 --> 12:18.535
It's exciting study.

12:18.700 --> 12:29.035
So you have a lift here, which is... Yes, in the art rooms, these are the ancient manuscripts.

12:29.055 --> 12:30.998
I understand.

12:31.198 --> 12:38.729
How many ancient manuscripts here?

12:38.749 --> 12:41.092
Did you give us how many manuscripts?

12:41.693 --> 12:43.436
We could see the catalog.

12:43.636 --> 12:44.337
Oh, good.

12:46.038 --> 12:49.042
This is beautiful.

12:49.062 --> 13:07.624
It's been modernized.

13:13.797 --> 13:24.131
We ask to see the church of St.

13:24.591 --> 13:25.112
Helena.

13:25.232 --> 13:25.813
St.

13:25.913 --> 13:26.414
Helena?

13:27.615 --> 13:36.828
That is the church that was created from the 90th century.

13:37.809 --> 13:38.730
Nice?

13:38.790 --> 13:38.991
Yes.

13:39.551 --> 13:40.092
Thank you.

13:40.797 --> 13:41.978
Eleanor or Helen?

13:41.998 --> 13:42.839
Santa Elena.

13:44.160 --> 13:44.720
Okay, Helen.

13:45.381 --> 13:47.002
Santa Elena.

13:47.022 --> 13:47.983
In English, I think, Helen.

13:48.904 --> 13:52.027
Take a picture of the doctor.

13:52.487 --> 13:56.891
Okay, can I take your picture with my wife?

13:56.911 --> 14:00.434
You can take one if they want to put in there.

14:00.454 --> 14:01.215
We'll do better.

14:01.335 --> 14:04.017
Do we have that church back there?

14:04.057 --> 14:04.158
St.

14:04.178 --> 14:04.318
George.

14:04.458 --> 14:04.598
St.

14:04.618 --> 14:06.299
George.

14:06.319 --> 14:06.399
St.

14:06.540 --> 14:07.120
George.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.302
What is that date from?

14:09.873 --> 14:15.343
18th century.

14:16.404 --> 14:19.069
There is a very pinacoteca.

14:19.530 --> 14:25.020
There is a lot of paintings.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.285
What is that building on the hill back there?

14:28.846 --> 14:29.327
I don't know.

14:29.688 --> 14:33.094
There is the rooms of the priesthood.

14:33.114 --> 14:33.855
I see, yes.

14:34.426 --> 14:36.409
But that St.

14:36.449 --> 15:04.045
George was built in the church of the chapter.

15:11.652 --> 15:22.178
Okay.

15:22.318 --> 15:26.488
Okay.

15:50.144 --> 16:05.368
That's right.

16:07.311 --> 16:10.937
That's right.
