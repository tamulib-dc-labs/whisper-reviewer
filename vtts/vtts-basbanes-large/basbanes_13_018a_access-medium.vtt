WEBVTT

00:03.153 --> 00:04.835
Okay, we're talking to Gene Smith.

00:05.676 --> 00:07.778
I'm sorry, Gene, we're just telling you, we're just walking.

00:07.838 --> 00:10.681
These are sakli.

00:12.683 --> 00:15.305
They're for initiation.

00:15.325 --> 00:21.071
You know, the Rama holds them up in front of you and says, hey, this is a guy you should meet.

00:21.091 --> 00:29.019
And these are painted and cut, and then they're used and pasted on the cards.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.742
Well, they actually print them like this.

00:32.650 --> 00:34.432
so that they can do lots of cards.

00:34.793 --> 00:37.116
But how do they use them, though, is the question.

00:37.136 --> 00:39.379
It's like, well, how do they function?

00:39.900 --> 00:47.650
Well, this is a particular type of, you know, to tell an explanation.

00:47.670 --> 00:48.431
An explanation of?

00:48.872 --> 00:51.055
Of a particular initiation.

00:52.937 --> 01:00.447
So this, these are all from the northern Tharama tradition, and they're, uh,

01:02.738 --> 01:09.171
I'll show you what they look like when they're painted.

01:09.192 --> 01:19.954
The pictures I took in New York, by the way, were great too.

01:20.693 --> 01:24.859
I brought along the text of my interview with you a couple of years ago.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.721
It was a 20-page single space.

01:26.781 --> 01:30.446
Hi, this is Jeff Waller.

01:30.466 --> 01:33.330
Hi, Jeff.

01:33.350 --> 01:33.490
Hi.

01:33.510 --> 01:45.927
Pleasure to meet you.

01:45.947 --> 01:47.149
We took some photographs.

01:47.189 --> 01:48.270
Maybe it's still upstairs.

01:52.402 --> 01:54.164
Oh, well.

01:54.184 --> 01:54.684
We'll find it.

01:54.765 --> 01:56.546
I'm just showing Nick around.

01:56.567 --> 01:57.688
Here's your book.

01:57.708 --> 01:58.569
I've got another one for you.

01:59.750 --> 02:00.431
I've got one for you.

02:00.831 --> 02:06.477
The more recent one, which is—actually, you were going to be in this one, but this book got to be too big.

02:07.578 --> 02:08.239
Oh, well.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.982
This is still 636 pages.

02:11.082 --> 02:17.329
Anyway, just leave it there.

02:17.815 --> 02:28.126
I'm going to take this because I've got my notes and stuff in here.

02:28.186 --> 02:32.431
So this is just a provisional home for you right now?

02:33.091 --> 02:38.117
And you already have your accommodations?

02:38.597 --> 02:40.820
Yeah.

02:41.160 --> 02:41.941
We'll start here.

02:43.623 --> 02:45.004
The books are arranged by

02:45.760 --> 02:46.641
by set.

02:46.661 --> 02:49.646
So these are the Satya and these are the Kagyu.

02:49.666 --> 02:52.530
The Spentans have four traditions.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.332
How do you spell words like this?

02:54.513 --> 02:57.737
S-A-K-Y-A, Satya.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.586
And these are Kagyu.

03:03.606 --> 03:06.770
Okay, and how do you spell that?

03:07.631 --> 03:07.952
K-A-G-Y-U.

03:08.172 --> 03:12.438
There are four Buddhist traditions and one non-Buddhist.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.042
Have you seen this book, by the way?

03:15.967 --> 03:18.870
It's one of the finest books I think ever done.

03:21.993 --> 03:22.554
What is it?

03:22.574 --> 03:23.655
Could you just tell me briefly?

03:23.695 --> 03:33.145
Well, it's the thinking of a guy named Schuster.

03:34.507 --> 03:35.928
Carl Schuster.

03:35.948 --> 03:37.670
C-A-R-L.

03:38.691 --> 03:40.233
S-C-H-U-S-E-R.

03:41.634 --> 03:45.298
And he was one of the great minds of our time.

03:46.409 --> 04:05.381
This is published by the Rock Foundation and can't carefully design all of these logins.

04:05.401 --> 04:06.723
Now, is this your room in here, Gene?

04:07.184 --> 04:12.433
No, this is the room of a gal who's doing her

04:14.017 --> 04:17.782
degree in sustainable international development at Brown.

04:17.802 --> 04:23.530
She needs a place to stay, and so... But the point is, you live among your collections, right?

04:24.111 --> 04:27.215
That's right.

04:27.796 --> 04:29.458
These are so colorful, I have to say.

04:29.498 --> 04:33.503
So, Sakya.

04:35.286 --> 04:39.071
And... Sorry, I didn't love my book.

04:39.111 --> 04:41.454
Sorry, I haven't seen that piece since Saturday.

04:41.474 --> 04:42.015
I'll give it to you.

04:43.295 --> 04:46.919
We're getting these books ready to go.

04:46.959 --> 04:53.407
We've got a young student coming in to wrap them.

04:54.028 --> 04:59.134
Could you explain the colorful coverings, the sheets?

05:00.055 --> 05:03.379
Books like any image, or like images need clothing.

05:03.399 --> 05:05.121
These are clothing for them.

05:05.141 --> 05:07.404
You have to periodically change it.

05:07.444 --> 05:11.108
You shouldn't have books uncovered.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.412
It's for the preservation aspect?

05:13.432 --> 05:17.497
Yeah, it also works for the preservation, but it's a sign of respect.

05:17.537 --> 05:25.567
You shouldn't have them on the floor either, so don't... And the books, all of these, they're like accordion shapes, right?

05:25.607 --> 05:27.149
No, they're not accordion shapes.

05:27.169 --> 05:30.093
They're just loose leaf.

05:30.934 --> 05:33.997
I guess it is a codex if it's loose leaf.

05:34.077 --> 05:36.280
Is it a codex type of a book?

05:36.340 --> 05:38.783
I suppose you'd call it that.

05:43.859 --> 05:49.247
This was done last year.

05:49.908 --> 05:52.172
No, this is a printed book, a recently printed book.

05:53.393 --> 05:54.695
Uh-uh.

05:54.715 --> 05:58.441
Still done in a traditional manner.

05:58.721 --> 05:58.922
Yep.

05:59.202 --> 06:00.384
Is the shape important?

06:00.404 --> 06:05.191
I mean, could it be done as a book as we know it in the Western sense?

06:05.472 --> 06:06.293
Could it be printed?

06:06.313 --> 06:08.596
Yeah, the Tibetans have two types of books.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.980
One is what's called the Depter.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.848
It comes from the Turkish, well, actually the Persian Dapta.

06:16.649 --> 06:20.533
And that's D-E-B.

06:20.553 --> 06:20.853
D-E-B.

06:22.134 --> 06:23.636
D-E-R.

06:23.656 --> 06:27.280
And those books are stitched along the top.

06:28.801 --> 06:34.047
The other kind of book are Pothi's, and these are loose-leaf.

06:34.387 --> 06:36.449
P-O-T-H-I.

06:37.410 --> 06:40.393
Pothi.

06:41.032 --> 06:50.729
Tibetans traditionally didn't like the Western-style book, although they have started to use them.

06:50.749 --> 07:05.014
However, when we talk about the book as artifact, because you are putting so much stuff on the Internet, does it matter the shape that it comes in?

07:05.129 --> 07:06.111
I don't know.

07:06.792 --> 07:07.513
Come and meet.

07:07.733 --> 07:08.835
I understand.

07:08.955 --> 07:19.511
I want you to meet somebody who's been in a moment, somebody who's been here scanning for the last two months.

07:20.112 --> 07:28.064
This is Gelugpa, spelled G-E-L-U-G, or G-E-L-U-G-P-A.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.190
These blue ones... And what are they?

07:32.210 --> 07:33.212
Are you going to come here?

07:33.935 --> 08:00.280
dominant sect of the tibetan tradition the dalai lama uh this is the yellow hats they're called sometimes these are bumbo these are non-buddhas and let me introduce you to oh he's been scanning the last uh

08:00.817 --> 08:05.224
So is this all staff or volunteers that you have here?

08:05.244 --> 08:09.210
Katerp is a Bunbo himself, and he's just completed scanning 101 volumes.

08:09.511 --> 08:09.691
Wow.

08:10.452 --> 08:22.130
Which he's taking back with him to... We gave it to him, and we're making some CDs, so it helps them... They take them back to where... Yeah.

08:22.791 --> 08:24.714
So we can raise money for their library.

08:27.058 --> 08:28.360
We're not interested in these.

08:28.660 --> 08:31.786
Bumbo things because we're a Buddhist center.

08:31.806 --> 08:33.489
But he's been doing them.

08:33.509 --> 08:34.230
But you have them.

08:34.550 --> 08:35.232
Yeah.

08:35.252 --> 08:38.377
And we've been working with the Glenn Foundation in New York.

08:41.923 --> 08:42.484
We have them.

08:43.386 --> 08:44.608
But there's just so much.

08:45.049 --> 08:48.475
There's only so much we can do.

08:53.163 --> 09:08.080
These are what these cards look like when they're painted.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.444
The cards you just showed me in the first row.

09:11.464 --> 09:17.972
And this explains what the deity is.

09:24.145 --> 09:27.489
So, this is one that we've recently done.

09:27.889 --> 09:30.573
This is a book that you printed or published?

09:30.593 --> 09:32.275
I work at Wisdom Publications.

09:32.595 --> 09:33.977
They're the publisher of this book?

09:33.997 --> 09:34.457
Right.

09:34.477 --> 09:34.717
Wow.

09:36.459 --> 09:38.001
Deities of Tibetan Buddhism.

09:38.662 --> 09:38.842
Right.

09:42.366 --> 09:46.411
It's a beautifully produced book, let me say.

09:47.292 --> 09:48.854
Hi, my name is Nick.

09:48.874 --> 09:49.274
How are you?

09:49.295 --> 09:50.996
Where's your picture?

09:51.017 --> 09:53.219
He's just completed.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.000
Uh-huh.

09:54.048 --> 10:07.127
He's been here at the suggestion of his uncle, who's the grand abbot of all the buttholes, and the Brunn Foundation, and has been scanning 101.

10:07.147 --> 10:07.548
Wow.

10:08.850 --> 10:10.712
He completed 101 volumes.

10:10.732 --> 10:12.815
Isn't that amazing?

10:12.836 --> 10:14.438
And you check every page, of course.

10:14.558 --> 10:15.459
Every page.

10:15.519 --> 10:20.046
This is where he's been working for the last three months.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.388
This is the scanner over here.

10:21.571 --> 10:29.141
Well, we've got this scanner, we've got this little tiny scanner, and then this is our newest acquisition.

10:29.281 --> 10:32.064
It's a $700 jobby.

10:33.606 --> 10:35.809
And the pages just run through.

10:36.189 --> 10:36.790
Okay.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.592
That's one good thing that you have a loose-leaf page.

10:38.612 --> 10:40.635
You don't have to mispline the book or anything like that.

10:40.655 --> 10:42.297
Nice to meet you.

10:42.317 --> 10:43.058
He's just leaving.

10:43.298 --> 10:47.764
He's getting Acrobat on his computer so he can read it.

10:48.385 --> 10:52.509
How long did it take him to do the 101 books?

10:52.529 --> 10:53.029
Three weeks.

10:53.049 --> 10:55.732
Three months.

10:55.752 --> 10:58.615
So it can be a pretty tedious process then.

10:58.735 --> 11:03.059
It is a tedious process.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.400
I don't see my sense of timing.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.042
The Exquisite Times is here.

11:06.683 --> 11:07.343
Isn't that something?

11:11.507 --> 11:16.632
I'll show you what he's been doing.

11:16.652 --> 11:17.633
And then we get the book

11:18.136 --> 11:22.703
coming in on CDs from India.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.785
They're scanning there as well.

11:27.771 --> 11:32.518
So you've been here for about four years, right?

11:32.539 --> 11:32.699
Yeah.

11:32.719 --> 11:35.443
Do you have a pretty good catalog of what you have?

11:35.463 --> 11:38.648
Do you have ours up here in a sense of what you have in-house?

11:39.249 --> 11:40.691
Let me show you the website.

11:40.771 --> 11:45.679
And what we're doing.

11:52.207 --> 11:57.875
I'm just working on the product that Peter has done.

11:57.895 --> 12:02.201
We have to be able to get them into the system.

12:02.221 --> 12:06.006
And these are the books that you scanned.

12:06.486 --> 12:11.573
These are our title pages because you have to be able to catalog them.

12:12.695 --> 12:21.066
And then we provide the cataloging for the ink print.

12:21.383 --> 12:24.508
That's from the Library of Congress.

12:24.528 --> 12:33.301
If you can't get a Library of Congress, we create one, a surrogate.

12:33.321 --> 12:50.327
Okay, so this is our website.

12:52.552 --> 13:00.440
As I told you, we're trying to build an encyclopedia of Tibet on the web.

13:00.480 --> 13:05.666
We're working with other organizations who are like-minded.

13:06.527 --> 13:11.232
This is our website.

13:11.252 --> 13:17.278
This tells us something about the books.

13:17.298 --> 13:17.679
Which I've been to.

13:17.699 --> 13:20.702
You can just type in here.

13:21.526 --> 13:44.370
Let's say we type in E8 and the name of E8.

13:44.390 --> 13:44.470
Wow.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.632
And then this will take us, it will return his biography.

13:45.652 --> 13:46.032
Ah, it's very slow.

13:46.349 --> 13:51.014
Do you get a lot of, can you record that with hits?

13:51.034 --> 13:51.454
Oh yeah.

13:51.474 --> 13:52.535
From all over the world.

13:52.555 --> 13:53.396
Great.

13:53.516 --> 14:03.346
And here, I'm looking for this particular person.

14:03.366 --> 14:09.211
This was the eighth head of the Karma Kagyu sect.

14:09.231 --> 14:15.057
He has his birthday, his death date, his primary title.

14:15.813 --> 14:37.218
Paul's name, variations, everything that he wrote, and we can go to any one of the titles he wrote, and we'll find out where it is.

14:37.238 --> 14:41.803
And then, these are his teachers, with links to all of the teachers, links to all of the students, his family relationships, father, mother, and this is why

14:45.850 --> 14:52.539
And then these are from the Rubin website.

14:52.599 --> 14:56.985
They're building a museum.

14:57.245 --> 15:01.931
Donald and Shelley Rubin are a remarkable couple.

15:01.952 --> 15:03.333
They started collecting tankas.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.436
They're not Buddhist.

15:06.678 --> 15:08.460
They simply just started, because they like them.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.742
It's a collectible for them, I'm sure.

15:09.762 --> 15:10.403
It's a collectible.

15:11.204 --> 15:13.026
But they're passionate about it.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.690
I was about to say it's a passion as well.

15:15.710 --> 15:15.790
Yes.

15:16.343 --> 15:18.706
And where are they from?

15:18.726 --> 15:19.748
They're in New York.

15:19.768 --> 15:21.991
They're in New York.

15:22.011 --> 15:23.593
And then this goes to their site.

15:28.139 --> 15:32.625
And then we can just zoom in on it.

15:32.645 --> 15:37.111
And it's a marvelous system.

15:37.191 --> 15:39.615
So we're building these two together.

15:39.695 --> 15:44.241
Right now, we only have the art and the book.

15:45.335 --> 15:49.400
We've got places on our site.

15:50.321 --> 16:02.175
Another thing that we're working with is the University of Virginia, where they're building a great ability to put multimedia up to that on the web.

16:03.436 --> 16:06.039
Because that's the way we're... Now, are they teaching?

16:06.480 --> 16:08.082
This is part of the curriculum down there?

16:09.303 --> 16:11.646
So we go up to there.

16:15.524 --> 16:39.192
And then we gave them the scans.

16:39.212 --> 16:39.893
So here we go to their collection.

16:39.913 --> 16:40.734
This is something about their collection.

16:40.754 --> 16:42.696
And we'll go to... There was a fellow that I met in New York at that gathering that was from UVA.

16:43.283 --> 16:44.745
Yes.

16:44.765 --> 16:47.129
David Germano?

16:47.770 --> 16:49.352
Could have been David Germano.

16:49.372 --> 16:50.854
Wasn't a fellow named Paul?

16:51.014 --> 16:52.777
Oh, Paul Hackett.

16:52.797 --> 16:54.179
Was he from UVA as well?

16:54.199 --> 16:57.404
Yes, that's right.

16:57.424 --> 17:02.151
He is, say, doing very well.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.315
But the principal contact down there would be Germano?

17:05.536 --> 17:07.599
David Germano.

17:07.619 --> 17:07.719
Okay.

17:07.739 --> 17:12.025
And you see here is on the East Level cataloging.

17:12.882 --> 17:20.110
And so we can navigate to a particular chapter of the book.

17:20.130 --> 17:23.013
Now, can somebody like me just go in and browse and find these things?

17:23.033 --> 17:25.456
If you don't know the name, I mean... No, no.

17:25.496 --> 17:29.340
We're trying now to make it more common sense.

17:29.361 --> 17:34.767
There, you see, is the product of our scans.

17:35.427 --> 17:40.493
And...

17:42.278 --> 17:47.444
So for you, this quest is really preservation of information and material.

17:47.844 --> 17:49.787
I mean, the artifact is important, to be sure.

17:50.648 --> 17:52.690
But it's not the end.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.954
But you're driven by preserving culture and information.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.196
The cultural identity of a people.

17:58.877 --> 18:02.301
By whatever means possible, and this is state-of-the-art.

18:02.381 --> 18:08.168
So we're working with Virginia.

18:08.654 --> 18:15.484
We give them the scans and they put it on the web.

18:15.824 --> 18:19.569
The next thing we're going to do is start putting some of our own scans on the web.

18:19.589 --> 18:23.314
That's what we're doing upstairs.

18:23.755 --> 18:27.921
We saw the books on the floor, unfortunately.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.645
I won't tell.

18:30.665 --> 18:33.769
You probably want to look at some.

18:33.829 --> 18:37.294
We do have a lot of rare books there.

18:37.578 --> 18:39.500
It was a rare book.

18:39.520 --> 18:50.574
We were never able to... I've always been afraid that something happened to me.

18:50.594 --> 19:00.846
So once we're able to scan these, we'll be able to distribute them to everybody.

19:00.986 --> 19:05.351
No, no, that's all right.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.032
This is...

19:06.367 --> 19:12.874
We've now completed about 2,000 volumes.

19:14.536 --> 19:22.124
And here are the volumes that we have done so far.

19:22.144 --> 19:33.977
And we scan them as TIFF, T-I-F-F, Tagged Information Format.

19:34.531 --> 19:36.613
These will last much longer.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.795
Then we convert these.

19:38.295 --> 19:39.717
Last to not understand.

19:40.238 --> 19:44.222
This is the sort of standard format that everybody needs.

19:45.404 --> 19:46.525
Technology changes.

19:46.645 --> 19:52.712
In two years it could be absolutely inaccessible.

19:52.732 --> 19:55.035
Somebody has to be migrating this stuff.

19:55.135 --> 19:56.516
Am I right?

19:56.536 --> 19:58.819
That's correct, and that's what we're doing.

19:58.839 --> 20:02.243
So what we're doing is

20:05.750 --> 20:06.771
we're just using.

20:08.352 --> 20:16.700
The acrobat changes it to something that's more readable.

20:16.961 --> 20:20.204
What's that rediscovered language?

20:20.224 --> 20:25.549
A lot of Tibetan Buddhism is passionate.

20:25.569 --> 20:33.536
Like I go out and I go to a place in the wilderness and I find a rock.

20:33.556 --> 20:35.318
In that rock, if I look into it,

20:35.517 --> 20:38.061
I will be able to decipher a whole book.

20:38.281 --> 20:42.306
And so that's what it's about.

20:42.326 --> 20:52.401
And that means rediscovered this teaching, was rediscovered by somebody we know from times we know, purportedly buried in the times gone by.

20:52.541 --> 20:56.747
Are we talking about an actual artifact rediscovered, or it's defined in some other way?

20:56.787 --> 20:58.569
It's probably defined in some other way.

20:58.589 --> 20:59.350
We're not sure.

21:00.932 --> 21:03.516
And these are texts.

21:04.525 --> 21:08.749
For example, we're getting ready to put on a CD.

21:09.890 --> 21:13.033
These are all hidden teachings.

21:13.053 --> 21:17.438
Now, that's a cycle of good practice recovered from... No, it should.

21:17.458 --> 21:18.198
It should.

21:18.238 --> 21:19.840
It's a... It's not good.

21:19.860 --> 21:23.143
It's a C-C, capital G, C-O-D-D.

21:23.864 --> 21:25.766
A cycle of could... How do you pronounce that?

21:25.786 --> 21:26.166
Should.

21:26.186 --> 21:27.527
Should practice.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.528
Rediscovered.

21:28.548 --> 21:28.849
Recovered.

21:28.869 --> 21:29.429
Recovered.

21:30.010 --> 21:30.610
Recovered.

21:30.630 --> 21:30.951
Recovered.

21:31.071 --> 21:32.372
Place of concealment.

21:32.588 --> 21:35.672
by Terchen Dorje Lingpa.

21:35.692 --> 21:41.860
We produce from a rare manuscript preserved at Ugin Chirling in Boomtown.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.203
But that's an item that you have here.

21:44.904 --> 21:45.565
Yes.

21:45.585 --> 21:48.829
No, we had it printed in India.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.773
Now we're turning it into a CD.

21:51.793 --> 21:52.193
I see.

21:52.574 --> 21:59.963
And the princess of this palace, Ugin Chirling, has got somebody there cataloging her great collection.

22:01.107 --> 22:01.928
We just did.

22:02.028 --> 22:05.733
We only published about 30 volumes from it.

22:06.854 --> 22:13.343
But, you know, a Tibetan is now there at the Ugin Chirling Palace.

22:13.503 --> 22:14.664
And that is where?

22:14.684 --> 22:15.005
Ugin Chirling?

22:15.125 --> 22:16.767
It's in Bhutan in Bhutan.

22:17.949 --> 22:20.692
And he's cataloging this collection.

22:20.712 --> 22:25.498
So prior to it being copied here, it existed in one manuscript copy?

22:25.518 --> 22:26.500
One manuscript copy.

22:27.841 --> 22:28.142
There is one.

22:28.662 --> 22:29.123
Here it is.

22:30.436 --> 22:57.845
And that's March 202, so... See, this is the manuscript.

22:57.865 --> 22:58.826
And so this is what Mr. Kader has been scanning.

22:58.846 --> 22:58.946
Okay.

22:58.966 --> 22:59.847
So we're... All of this is from this palace.

22:59.867 --> 23:00.207
Now, these aren't

23:00.541 --> 23:03.745
Again, these are not scanned from materials that you have here.

23:03.765 --> 23:10.353
Oh, they're scanned from materials we have here that we published in India.

23:10.373 --> 23:18.583
We got the manuscripts down from Bhutan, selected some, and then we published them.

23:18.603 --> 23:20.365
So you copy them here.

23:20.385 --> 23:28.455
For example, here, this is the title page for the... This was published in 1984.

23:29.060 --> 23:49.093
P-H-I-M-P-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-T-H-U-

23:51.183 --> 23:53.525
And this is the Library of Congress cataloging.

23:53.645 --> 24:00.332
So if I were to go to the LC catalog and punch in 849-01-308, this would pop up.

24:00.352 --> 24:01.393
This would pop up.

24:01.493 --> 24:04.876
And I'll get all the information I need in terms of spellings and stuff.

24:04.896 --> 24:05.117
Right.

24:05.177 --> 24:05.877
By going there.

24:06.198 --> 24:06.999
That's right.

24:07.019 --> 24:11.563
Instead of trying to write it down, all I need is that LC number.

24:11.623 --> 24:12.084
That's right.

24:12.104 --> 24:14.426
LC control number.

24:14.446 --> 24:19.671
And we've just done an interesting project.

24:20.495 --> 24:24.962
on illustrated direct books.

24:26.985 --> 24:49.759
We have been working with a big ceremony that's going on out in Austin, Texas, where a High Lama has come, the head of one sect, the Ningua sect, has come to teach

24:50.937 --> 24:53.460
this rare set of teaching.

24:54.661 --> 25:00.768
This is the stories of this little visionary boy who was 13 years old.

25:02.090 --> 25:05.674
He started having probably migraines.

25:06.715 --> 25:10.199
All of this stuff was coming out of his head.

25:10.219 --> 25:20.151
And he found, fortunately, a sympathetic adult, Lama, who started recording.

25:20.890 --> 25:21.771
what the kid said.

25:24.736 --> 25:28.281
And the kid just continued to babble.

25:30.023 --> 25:36.312
And these were recorded in thirteen volumes.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.918
This was really a difficult thing to find.

25:40.078 --> 25:42.461
It happened in 1983?

25:42.481 --> 25:44.604
No, that was when we found the copy.

25:44.624 --> 25:45.185
You found it.

25:45.205 --> 25:47.168
So that's when you were still with L.C.

25:48.211 --> 25:53.077
So what we had was, this is the title page for the original.

25:53.097 --> 26:09.099
It was published by His Holiness Dingo Kenze of Bhutan, and the Venerable Pema Norbu Rinpoche of Mysore, and the only set that was in existence then.

26:11.021 --> 26:11.782
Hey Leonard!

26:13.524 --> 26:16.328
Let me introduce you to Nick.

26:16.443 --> 26:30.401
I was just telling you about the Nam Chu and how it was found.

26:30.421 --> 26:32.323
And that's the Nam Chu there?

26:32.343 --> 26:34.005
And I, the Sky Teacher.

26:34.045 --> 26:38.451
How would I find a record for this NLC?

26:38.988 --> 26:45.214
Well, at first I can deal with it.

26:45.234 --> 26:47.957
I'm just going to write it.

26:47.977 --> 26:51.941
I'll take the number.

26:52.742 --> 26:55.644
Maybe we didn't.

26:55.665 --> 26:57.967
Yeah, just G-N-A-M.

26:58.147 --> 26:59.008
G-N-A-M.

26:59.588 --> 27:00.709
C-H-O-S.

27:01.090 --> 27:02.311
C-H-O-S.

27:03.312 --> 27:06.295
And it was published in India.

27:07.540 --> 27:12.345
actually from Bhutan, but the copies had been lost.

27:14.527 --> 27:28.280
And it turned out that it was a French traveler, André Migault, who happened on this monastery, this hermitage, when they were still carving it.

27:28.300 --> 27:28.380
Wow.

27:28.400 --> 27:35.046
And he thought it was missed if he had all these pictures in it.

27:35.066 --> 27:36.608
Really weird pictures.

27:36.628 --> 27:37.108
I'll show you some.

27:37.426 --> 27:49.638
And so he bought a copy, he bought a set of these, and took them back and put them in the Musée Guinée in Paris, where they sat.

27:49.658 --> 27:52.361
And where, about when is it?

27:52.421 --> 27:53.362
1940.

27:53.382 --> 27:54.883
Yeah, 1940.

27:55.544 --> 28:02.190
He was, his partner was killed by the bandits at that time.

28:02.271 --> 28:06.775
But he had these in... Did you ever meet them?

28:07.733 --> 28:11.338
He did by the time I got to him.

28:11.939 --> 28:12.479
These were there.

28:12.540 --> 28:30.043
And then Mathieu Ricard, a French monk, who was a student of Kinzer, in which case, was able to borrow, to make photocopies of the originals from Paris.

28:30.063 --> 28:35.631
And then the Lama sent in his student to get the rest of it.

28:36.353 --> 28:38.835
Everybody thought the blocks had been destroyed.

28:40.417 --> 28:46.723
But the villagers had never been paid for the carving.

28:46.863 --> 28:51.708
So they didn't turn them over.

28:51.728 --> 28:52.548
They didn't get burned.

28:53.469 --> 29:04.960
So Lama Kutsang went there, and they were very suspicious of it.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.202
There was a little hermit, it was called Muxan.

29:09.323 --> 29:17.611
He went there and he said that, you know, there used to be a set of blocks for these teachings here.

29:17.631 --> 29:22.515
If you have them, no.

29:22.535 --> 29:25.899
What was this?

29:25.939 --> 29:25.999
No.

29:26.019 --> 29:30.603
And then, because the set in Paris was incomplete, he finally got them to admit that it was.

29:30.623 --> 29:34.947
They were not necessarily destroyed.

29:35.602 --> 29:47.818
And then when they found out that he was the servant of the head of the monastery, that they permissioned him, they said, well, before we tell you where they are, you've got to pay us.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.803
And how long has it been?

29:52.824 --> 29:53.285
Forty years.

29:53.345 --> 29:54.606
Forty years.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.431
With no interest involved?

29:58.451 --> 30:03.077
So the blacks were found and printed.

30:04.205 --> 30:08.896
and they were then re-produced from India.

30:09.357 --> 30:20.423
We are still missing a few pages, but let's see if I can find some pictures.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.348
So this is a whole collection?

30:31.137 --> 30:35.123
So you made a copy of this, and then you scanned it and put it on your site?

30:35.143 --> 30:36.826
Oh, we haven't put it on our site.

30:36.846 --> 30:39.269
It will be there.

30:39.289 --> 30:40.771
So I can't go look this up then?

30:41.212 --> 30:42.294
No, I see it.

30:42.314 --> 30:43.636
It's all pictures.

30:43.716 --> 30:47.622
No, it's not on the site, because we don't have the web space.

30:47.642 --> 30:50.406
But it's just filled with strange pictures.

30:51.247 --> 30:55.534
Well, could you print out the title page of that for me, possibly?

30:55.554 --> 30:55.874
Sure.

30:57.236 --> 30:58.478
That would help.

31:01.512 --> 31:04.475
I mean, this is interesting.

31:04.595 --> 31:19.790
I love these stories.

31:19.810 --> 31:27.698
Anyway, that's more of what brought you.

31:27.818 --> 31:29.680
We've just done this for

31:30.149 --> 31:50.377
one of our board members who just sponsored this great ceremony.

31:50.397 --> 31:50.897
Printing the whole thing.

31:50.917 --> 31:51.318
You don't want that.

31:51.338 --> 31:51.778
No, I don't want that.

31:51.799 --> 31:52.159
That would cancel.

31:52.179 --> 31:52.319
I know.

31:52.339 --> 31:52.900
Just want to print the page.

32:18.209 --> 32:41.759
But it does have an LC controller, doesn't it?

32:41.779 --> 32:41.879
Yeah.

32:41.899 --> 32:42.200
All right, gee.

32:42.220 --> 32:42.780
Just turn it off, obviously.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.241
I'll take any of that.

32:43.261 --> 32:43.762
I use everything in here.

32:43.782 --> 32:44.082
It's in French.

32:44.382 --> 32:58.460
Well, Leonard is the president of the organization.

32:58.480 --> 32:58.841
I see.

32:58.921 --> 33:00.703
So, Leonard, I'm sorry, did I get your last name?

33:00.904 --> 33:03.547
Oh, my God.

33:03.667 --> 33:04.368
I'm sorry.

33:04.508 --> 33:05.369
And could you spell it?

33:05.930 --> 33:07.873
V-A-N-D-E-R-K-U-I-J-P.

33:08.273 --> 33:09.195
Three words.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.356
Three words.

33:11.078 --> 33:21.487
And we set this up.

33:25.771 --> 33:26.292
Set what up?

33:26.312 --> 33:27.353
I'm sorry.

33:27.393 --> 33:28.374
The QVRC.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.275
I see.

33:29.315 --> 33:40.765
Basically, the purpose is to build a database

33:41.622 --> 33:44.305
so that you can find things.

33:44.425 --> 33:47.768
Right now, Tibetan studies is vastly serendipitous.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.170
You have to remember.

33:50.190 --> 33:56.457
We have to remember what we've read.

33:56.477 --> 34:07.127
And, uh, and then to make available to everybody, uh, look, why don't we go in there and sit?

34:07.147 --> 34:07.748
Okay.

34:09.590 --> 34:10.971
Okay, this is, uh, yeah.

34:23.911 --> 34:26.535
And Nick Wipps from Glass Beyond You.

34:26.575 --> 34:28.017
Yeah, amazing, yeah.

34:28.138 --> 34:34.467
It's the same county, everything.

34:34.628 --> 34:35.329
Same weather.

34:35.349 --> 34:35.509
Exactly.

34:36.411 --> 34:37.392
Today's the 17th, right?

34:37.813 --> 34:41.839
I'm going to Ann Arbor on Wednesday, which is the 19th.

34:41.859 --> 34:45.905
What are you doing at Ann Arbor?

34:46.106 --> 34:51.454
I'm giving a lecture at the university on this book and the one that's coming out.

34:52.447 --> 34:53.508
This book is fun.

34:53.788 --> 35:01.615
I had planned, the original manuscript that I submitted for this book had 300,000 books.

35:01.635 --> 35:03.137
It's 18 chapters.

35:03.177 --> 35:19.391
One of the most outstanding scholars on, you know, who's a keen with computer technology.

35:19.411 --> 35:20.192
He has a site

35:21.168 --> 35:23.751
which you should probably know about, called Mitarta.

35:24.752 --> 35:25.392
That would be?

35:25.813 --> 35:29.637
N-I-T-A-R-T-H-A.

35:30.397 --> 35:33.841
N-I-T-A-R-T-H-A dot org.

35:33.861 --> 35:35.162
Dot org.

35:35.182 --> 35:38.666
And he has all sorts of interesting stuff on it.

35:40.047 --> 35:43.811
He is a, and we had probably some of his followers.

35:45.633 --> 35:48.435
We're working with a Lama who's working with him.

35:49.196 --> 35:49.977
They're doing a

35:50.986 --> 35:55.330
Encyclopedia of Exceptional Terminology for the Web.

35:55.351 --> 36:16.032
It's a very slow process, which involves taking texts that have been input and linking them together into a format where you can find out what the context of your terminology.

36:17.513 --> 36:19.035
He is

36:20.450 --> 36:28.619
And there was Paul Hackett, who has been down in New Mexico.

36:29.380 --> 36:36.388
He was the person I wanted to use as a computer expert, but that was not to be.

36:37.510 --> 36:48.162
He's working for lots of people in New Mexico, in Taos.

36:49.171 --> 36:52.715
Entering this year, Columbia, for a graduate firm.

36:52.735 --> 36:53.636
Yeah, a young fellow.

36:53.676 --> 36:55.938
He was very good at computing.

36:55.958 --> 36:57.700
There were nine people there.

36:57.720 --> 37:03.546
There was one, as I later learned, one very senior revered Lama there, a fellow to my left.

37:03.706 --> 37:11.114
And we were talking, and Gene says, well, maybe we should just tell him who this guy is.

37:11.134 --> 37:13.076
Because I was asking very naive questions.

37:13.096 --> 37:14.217
I said, well, listen.

37:14.517 --> 37:17.320
He was born in India, I guess.

37:17.540 --> 37:19.122
He was born outside of Tibet.

37:19.542 --> 37:27.972
I didn't get his name, because I couldn't... This was July 28th, 1998, because I've got the date here.

37:28.112 --> 37:28.953
This is before I came.

37:29.473 --> 37:29.894
In New York.

37:30.054 --> 37:30.775
In New York.

37:31.035 --> 37:39.023
I said, here, my Jew now wants to cool me in about this man's background.

37:39.064 --> 37:42.107
And you say, he is a reincarnation, a very, very important Lama.

37:42.127 --> 37:43.208
And also, then I couldn't

37:43.677 --> 37:45.159
and we take care of you.

37:45.179 --> 37:45.800
You are my son.

37:45.820 --> 37:48.365
Your duties in the future is to preserve our lineage, our culture.

37:48.845 --> 37:52.251
And his teacher passed away, and he is sort of evident among the young generation.

37:52.872 --> 37:56.818
But who that person is... Oh, that's Odin Tongu.

37:56.958 --> 37:59.482
Tongu was standing over the background.

37:59.703 --> 38:04.451
So to his previous incarnation, his duties to perform, he was brought up like father and son.

38:04.471 --> 38:07.255
Thirdly, his own motivation, he feels very strongly dedicated.

38:07.707 --> 38:10.071
I couldn't believe this person was telling me this.

38:10.452 --> 38:12.615
The language was trying to translate.

38:13.116 --> 38:14.538
He was born outside of Tibet.

38:14.638 --> 38:16.181
He was born up in an atmosphere of Tibet.

38:16.842 --> 38:20.809
I say, a Tibetan man speaking very difficult, so I just can't.

38:23.213 --> 38:27.480
And I say, Gene says he will be able to help me when I call.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.622
So here you are.

38:28.662 --> 38:30.745
Yes, that's what you're going to say.

38:31.197 --> 38:32.579
Those things work out.

38:32.699 --> 38:42.571
I believe that, I mean, I'm a journalist by training and inclination, but I like to stick with stories over a period of years and follow them and see where they go.

38:43.512 --> 38:49.280
So I think that waiting the four years is really good because you had just basically been out of L.C.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.541
for a year at that point.

38:50.862 --> 38:51.883
Well, for several years.

38:52.183 --> 38:54.666
I think 97 or so is when you said you could out.

38:54.686 --> 38:55.888
96, I think.

38:56.388 --> 39:00.073
So you were still kind of finding your way in depth.

39:00.408 --> 39:08.200
So here we are now, six years later, and you really do have—you know where you're going with this thing, it seems to me.

39:08.641 --> 39:09.102
Well, maybe.

39:09.242 --> 39:13.168
I don't know.

39:14.410 --> 39:22.903
We're trying to get it up and running, and I think New York will give us more breathing room.

39:22.923 --> 39:27.090
It's much easier to raise funds there, isn't it, sir?

39:28.133 --> 39:29.675
Do you have your address?

39:29.695 --> 39:30.676
Do you know where you're going to be?

39:30.937 --> 39:31.577
Yes.

39:31.597 --> 39:32.098
115.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.481
Right.

39:34.501 --> 39:35.162
5th Avenue.

39:35.182 --> 39:35.623
Oh wow.

39:35.863 --> 39:36.303
Okay.

39:36.544 --> 39:37.285
7th floor.

39:39.167 --> 39:40.829
Right.

39:41.210 --> 39:44.334
We can start sending mail there.

39:44.354 --> 39:44.454
Okay.

39:44.474 --> 39:46.156
And the same email will go with you.

39:46.376 --> 39:46.677
Yes.

39:48.319 --> 39:55.068
And we will, the Rubens have bought the old Barneys building.

39:55.728 --> 39:57.010
So the Rubens are helping here.

39:58.002 --> 39:59.904
Well, they're giving us free space.

40:00.425 --> 40:12.738
Plus, they'd be very kind if we funded our computer person.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.321
Would it be worth my while to talk to both of them?

40:15.341 --> 40:18.304
Oh yeah, because we're closely connected.

40:18.465 --> 40:22.109
So how do I get in touch?

40:22.149 --> 40:25.292
Give me an email address or telephone number or something?

40:25.627 --> 40:29.072
This will work over a period of months.

40:30.314 --> 40:31.796
Oh yeah, sure.

40:31.856 --> 40:44.475
And my style is such, by the way, I'd be happy to let you read this before I submit it, especially where I'm dealing in areas that are, especially spellings and stuff like that, are also like grasp concepts.

40:46.799 --> 40:52.487
I defer to the experts, if that's all right with you.

40:52.648 --> 40:52.888
Sure.

40:52.948 --> 40:54.250
I'm happy to...

40:54.652 --> 41:00.482
You know, what you lose, by giving people an opportunity to read things sometimes, there's always a chance to say, geez, did I really say that?

41:00.663 --> 41:02.706
You know, you have to quote me on that, you know.

41:02.726 --> 41:11.822
And then I usually acquiesce, unless it's really something that I really feel is, anyway, there's never a problem with me.

41:11.842 --> 41:19.275
Well, the only thing I've ever growled with is headlines, or you know, captions like that.

41:19.677 --> 41:20.959
that one yesterday.

41:22.060 --> 41:25.305
Was that near the top of the story, or was it deep in the story?

41:25.825 --> 41:27.548
It was the headline.

41:27.808 --> 41:33.616
I understand, but where did the writer discuss your background of the draft?

41:33.636 --> 41:35.359
In your time, sir.

41:35.379 --> 41:35.599
Yeah.

41:35.819 --> 41:39.464
But did the writer deal with it near the top of the story?

41:39.484 --> 41:42.548
No, she dealt with it as he was a peaceneg.

41:43.029 --> 41:44.571
He was a peaceneg.

41:44.591 --> 41:47.595
But then a resistor is a lot different than a peaceneg.

41:47.615 --> 41:49.498
There is, yeah.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.256
Who was the writer?

41:52.618 --> 41:53.359
Barbara Stewart.

41:53.659 --> 41:55.462
I don't know her.

41:55.762 --> 41:58.926
Did she tell you that she was going to use that in her headline?

41:58.966 --> 42:01.129
No, the writers have nothing to do with the headlines.

42:01.370 --> 42:04.634
The writer doesn't know what the headline's going to be until they see it in the paper.

42:04.794 --> 42:05.696
It's true.

42:05.816 --> 42:07.518
And in fact, if she's hiding from me.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.444
You haven't been able to catch her.

42:11.624 --> 42:14.668
It's whoever was writing the heads that day on the desk.

42:16.210 --> 42:17.612
It's unnecessarily provocative.

42:17.778 --> 42:22.644
I was just giving you the needle a little bit is what it is.

42:22.664 --> 42:24.426
A little bit, you know.

42:24.866 --> 42:28.610
But I thought the story was, which I'll give you.

42:30.933 --> 42:35.538
So tell me a little bit about your involvement in this project, if you like.

42:35.558 --> 42:39.202
Yeah, I came here to this area in 1995 from Seattle.

42:39.943 --> 42:40.884
I mean, first to Washington.

42:41.225 --> 42:41.725
To do what?

42:41.785 --> 42:42.787
To Steve Tsebetna here.

42:42.927 --> 42:43.227
I see.

42:43.327 --> 42:44.088
Tsebetna in Haitian.

42:44.188 --> 42:44.889
And where did he teach?

42:45.029 --> 42:45.430
At Harvard.

42:45.450 --> 42:45.810
At Harvard.

42:46.111 --> 42:48.916
And I've been in that for about seven years.

42:48.936 --> 42:50.478
And I've known Gene since 1982.

42:50.499 --> 42:52.722
I have to go back 20 years.

42:52.762 --> 42:53.724
Tell me something about him.

42:53.804 --> 42:55.447
He's incredible.

42:56.609 --> 42:58.873
How important is he to this?

42:58.893 --> 43:00.035
To Tibetan studies in general.

43:00.155 --> 43:01.858
He's kind of dean of modern Tibetan studies.

43:02.159 --> 43:07.145
There's nobody in the world who knows as much about Tibet and Tibet anthropology of Gene.

43:07.185 --> 43:07.686
How is this?

43:07.786 --> 43:13.033
Of course, as an American, a former Mormon community, how can he know more than Tibetans, you know?

43:13.373 --> 43:14.395
Is that possible?

43:14.775 --> 43:17.999
It's very possible, and you'll find many Tibetans even deferring to him as well.

43:18.480 --> 43:18.840
Really?

43:18.901 --> 43:23.827
And now he's back, he doesn't want to hear this.

43:23.847 --> 43:27.812
He's going to have to read about whatever he likes.

43:32.197 --> 43:34.299
Does it all start with the preservation of text?

43:34.599 --> 43:35.860
Yes.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.042
Yes.

43:37.242 --> 43:49.814
We have two main aims with this TBRC, which was the brain job of Gene, and he's also the main person behind, of course.

43:50.234 --> 43:52.897
He's the prime mover.

43:53.597 --> 43:58.542
One is, for example, the database, which essentially means inputting what Gene knows,

43:59.112 --> 44:01.975
What he knows or what he's gathered?

44:01.995 --> 44:03.296
What he knows and what he's gathered.

44:03.476 --> 44:05.158
So are you doing all the histories of him?

44:05.338 --> 44:07.820
How are you extracting this from him?

44:08.100 --> 44:11.463
He's typing all the information in, inputting information.

44:11.764 --> 44:12.764
And writing books like this.

44:12.825 --> 44:26.537
And then secondly, we hope to be able to scan, and we've been very successful so far, to scan all the available Tibetan books.

44:27.277 --> 44:30.841
and ultimately put the entire corpus onto the website.

44:31.041 --> 44:36.167
Is it fair to say that books would be lost at the point for Gene?

44:36.387 --> 44:55.950
Well, Gene, and now you probably don't want to hear this again, but in the late 1960s, the Library of Congress put together, had this PL for 80 program, public law for 80, which essentially meant an exchange of books published in India for early grain shipments from the United States in the early 60s.

44:56.808 --> 45:22.495
and Gino's instrumental in getting the Tibetan collection, the Tibetan books, which the Tibetan refugee community had transported across the border, either in Northern India or into Nepal or into Bhutan or Sikkim, I think Sikkim was a country at the time, to have them publish, print and publish their collections and make them part of this pre-offering program.

45:23.167 --> 45:26.532
So it's mainly PL80.

45:27.012 --> 45:29.135
Public law.

45:29.155 --> 45:30.097
Public law.

45:30.217 --> 45:31.799
Public law.

45:31.999 --> 45:50.185
And it's mainly because of this particular program and Gene's foresight that we now have a number of libraries in the world, most of which are, of course, in the States, that have collections of between 7,000 and 8,000 volumes that were published under auspices of the PL80 program.

45:51.347 --> 45:52.228
And that was Gene's branch office.

45:52.917 --> 46:01.169
So in that respect, all of us who do Tibetan studies, whether we like it or not, and most of us don't mind at all, are indebted to Gene for having this idea.

46:01.189 --> 46:21.658
Did you know what you were looking for, Gene, in terms of books specifically, or was it just mainly gathering stuff as you... No, I was very fortunate to have been at the University of Washington in Seattle when the Rockefeller program began.

46:22.432 --> 46:30.263
The Rockefeller Foundation, in 1959, it was just after the Tibetans left.

46:30.283 --> 46:32.686
They had the first conference.

46:32.706 --> 46:45.844
And they decided to experiment and bring live Tibetans to nine, what, centers and see what would happen.

46:48.147 --> 46:52.253
And, you know, many of these Tibetans had never lived without servants before.

46:52.688 --> 46:54.550
And all over the world, huh?

46:54.570 --> 46:55.371
Not only in the States?

46:55.391 --> 46:57.012
It was in Europe as well.

46:57.393 --> 46:57.553
Wow.

46:58.494 --> 46:59.014
Yeah.

46:59.034 --> 47:02.358
So they set up actually eight centers finally.

47:03.199 --> 47:10.766
The ninth was to have been India, but the Indians hated each other so much and played politics.

47:10.906 --> 47:12.007
It was never set up in India.

47:12.027 --> 47:21.497
So there were nine aid centers, Japan, the United States, London, Paris,

47:22.574 --> 47:30.343
Uh, Rome, Munich, uh, Leiden, uh, uh, Copenhagen.

47:31.964 --> 47:33.446
Where else?

47:33.466 --> 47:34.928
Bohem.

47:34.948 --> 47:36.129
Bohem, you know, correct?

47:36.149 --> 47:36.449
Munich.

47:37.090 --> 47:37.751
Not Bohem?

47:37.771 --> 47:38.091
No.

47:38.111 --> 47:40.814
They came later, these Tibetans?

47:40.834 --> 47:41.054
Yes, I see.

47:41.074 --> 47:49.864
And they brought, they gave the funding to bring, uh, you know, a group of Tibetans to each of those centers.

47:51.160 --> 47:59.429
the University of Washington got a very great bibliophile, the Daishin Rinpoche, to whom this book is dedicated.

48:00.751 --> 48:11.143
Daishin Rinpoche was the tutor to the Sakya, Punso Poran, one of the royal houses of the Sakya sect.

48:13.245 --> 48:19.412
And he said, well, to do our program, we need books.

48:20.455 --> 48:27.625
Because we had, I think there were 12 or 13 books there.

48:28.046 --> 48:33.854
So he said, why don't you go out to Europe and make photocopies?

48:33.874 --> 48:36.617
You know, the one we didn't have photocopies was make microphones.

48:36.637 --> 48:39.281
This was in the early 60s, huh?

48:39.381 --> 48:40.463
You're not working for L.C.

48:40.503 --> 48:40.603
yet?

48:40.743 --> 48:41.624
No, no.

48:41.644 --> 48:47.172
It was 1962.

48:48.130 --> 49:04.445
Most of the Europeans would not let us have books, would not have us have copies.

49:04.725 --> 49:04.926
Why?

49:06.409 --> 49:08.333
I'm going to publish it.

49:08.498 --> 49:12.102
Replication seems to be a dirty word, you know.

49:12.163 --> 49:15.847
I mean, people, especially when you get into the manuscript field, they don't want people to cut it.

49:15.867 --> 49:17.770
Especially in the academy.

49:17.810 --> 49:19.892
That's exactly what I'm talking about, you know.

49:20.593 --> 49:29.424
So, even though this family, father, had given the books to Professor, to Tucci, he was the worst.

49:29.885 --> 49:31.466
Tucci, huh?

49:32.388 --> 49:32.528
Yeah.

49:32.548 --> 49:36.733
Who was the great .

49:37.152 --> 49:41.618
He would not let copies of anything leave.

49:42.499 --> 49:43.060
That's amazing.

49:43.180 --> 49:51.691
You'll find an interesting chapter on him in a book edited by Don Lopez called Curators of the Buddha.

49:51.711 --> 49:52.211
Curators?

49:52.272 --> 49:53.433
Curators of the Buddha.

49:54.414 --> 49:55.896
You know Don's first wife.

49:55.916 --> 49:56.397
Of the what?

49:56.417 --> 49:56.837
Curators?

49:56.858 --> 49:57.498
Of the Buddha.

49:57.518 --> 49:58.660
Of the Buddha.

49:58.680 --> 49:59.201
Curators.

49:59.301 --> 50:00.342
Curators of the Buddha.

50:00.710 --> 50:01.711
I'll be able to find this?

50:01.912 --> 50:02.512
Yes.

50:02.593 --> 50:04.475
I think it's Amazon.

50:04.575 --> 50:06.438
Oh, yes, University of Chicago Cross.

50:06.498 --> 50:06.878
Great.

50:06.898 --> 50:07.259
So far.

50:07.499 --> 50:09.221
Excellent.

50:10.864 --> 50:13.307
So he wouldn't let us look at it.

50:13.327 --> 50:14.168
He wouldn't look at it.

50:16.351 --> 50:27.005
So we got a lot of books from the English were very easy, as were the Dutch.

50:28.187 --> 50:29.248
The French were difficult.

50:30.950 --> 50:32.392
Those were easy or difficult?

50:32.693 --> 50:33.894
Easy.

50:33.914 --> 50:34.535
That's good to hear.

50:36.979 --> 50:51.761
And when we went back to, I went back to Seattle with, you know, a fairly insightful microphone in which they said, well, none of this refers specifically to the things you want to study.

50:52.302 --> 51:00.214
You know, they're books, but I realized that there had to be a lot of books in order to,

51:00.937 --> 51:01.698
to study.

51:01.738 --> 51:14.797
So he, we sort of sat, I just sat every day at his feet from 1960 to when I came to come back from Europe to when I left in 80, 90, 65.

51:15.678 --> 51:17.020
Just right wrote down what he said.

51:17.601 --> 51:21.747
It was an unprecedented collaboration between the Tudent and one of the greatest

51:22.013 --> 51:26.661
What's his name again?

51:28.524 --> 51:31.128
He was very fortunate.

51:32.209 --> 51:34.072
I just happened to be there at the time.

51:34.133 --> 51:34.553
He was.

51:35.475 --> 51:38.740
He said, go out to India.

51:41.144 --> 51:44.950
He said, and he told me what to get.

51:45.689 --> 52:06.653
But in the meantime, Gene published a two-volume bibliography of the manuscripts, published kind of semi-positively in Seattle.

52:06.673 --> 52:09.876
I don't know.

52:10.117 --> 52:13.080
Maybe it is.

52:13.904 --> 52:15.806
I'm probably going to work on this this week.

52:16.047 --> 52:28.943
So then the idea was to make them available and some of the European scholars, Tucci was furious that we were going to, he came to see me.

52:29.544 --> 52:30.585
What, in Seattle?

52:30.605 --> 52:32.027
No, in India.

52:32.067 --> 52:33.689
He was allowed into India.

52:33.729 --> 52:36.272
I did, after a long absence.

52:37.133 --> 52:39.777
And he said, you shouldn't publish Pema Karpo.

52:41.419 --> 52:43.101
He said, I'm going to publish it.

52:43.452 --> 52:46.415
But it was the holders of the lineage.

52:46.435 --> 52:49.799
He was like, you know, sort of their most important philosopher.

52:51.981 --> 52:53.022
And ritual.

52:53.042 --> 52:56.265
And I said, well, you know, it's their tradition, not ours.

52:57.266 --> 52:58.527
And he didn't understand that.

52:59.749 --> 53:00.670
So they published it.

53:02.832 --> 53:04.574
But this was in the late 60s.

53:04.734 --> 53:05.274
Yeah.

53:05.334 --> 53:11.721
In the meantime, finally, Gene leaves this out, but in the meantime, he kind of, in a way, bummed around India and Nepal for a couple of years.

53:12.173 --> 53:19.227
And then somehow, I don't know the background here, but somehow a lot of Congress hired him as a local hand.

53:19.247 --> 53:20.008
A local hire.

53:20.249 --> 53:21.972
Basically it was five rupees a month.

53:23.896 --> 53:25.398
It was five hundred.

53:25.779 --> 53:34.536
Can I just ask a question, if you don't mind?

53:34.870 --> 53:36.572
thinking about your life at this point.

53:36.592 --> 53:38.315
I mean, what were you studying or doing?

53:38.335 --> 53:40.778
Staying out of the draft.

53:41.279 --> 53:42.440
But that's a negative.

53:42.460 --> 53:43.602
There has to be a positive.

53:43.662 --> 53:47.507
I mean, what were you directing your life?

53:47.828 --> 53:48.969
I had no role.

53:49.149 --> 53:52.754
I know you've told me before you don't consider yourself a librarian.

53:52.955 --> 53:53.195
No.

53:53.495 --> 53:54.777
You still don't.

53:54.797 --> 53:55.778
Or a bibliographer.

53:57.341 --> 54:00.505
I asked you if you're driven or obsessed.

54:00.525 --> 54:02.448
You said, no, I think you have to be driven.

54:02.488 --> 54:03.970
Do you think he's driven?

54:03.990 --> 54:04.270
Yeah.

54:04.469 --> 54:09.234
He said he's not driven, but I know what I see.

54:09.594 --> 54:11.156
But he's driven in a very positive way.

54:11.216 --> 54:19.825
In a very positive way, but you're not an antiquarian with respect that you're collecting rarities because they're rare and they're precious.

54:19.925 --> 54:20.766
I'm not interested.

54:20.786 --> 54:22.828
You're looking for content, it seems to me.

54:22.888 --> 54:24.450
Is that a fair statement?

54:24.470 --> 54:29.515
Totally fair, because if you realize the kind of things that could have been bought

54:30.136 --> 54:37.708
for apple and egg in the pond, India, from the Tibetan refugee community in the early 60s that were really treasures.

54:38.910 --> 54:44.158
And why didn't you get the things for the apple and the orange?

54:44.238 --> 54:45.680
It's because I didn't have the apples.

54:47.643 --> 54:53.292
I mean, myself, I grabbed everything I could see, and you would too, I'm sure.

54:53.542 --> 54:56.326
I've already done a few objects, but not so many.

54:57.006 --> 55:00.571
I do get dizzy by effects.

55:00.731 --> 55:01.072
No, thanks.

55:02.714 --> 55:04.937
But Gene simply loves books, loves Tibetan books.

55:06.539 --> 55:21.338
And Gene is there also a bit modest here, as usual, because not only did he study with Dijin, who was probably the former scholar of his age, and was interested in every kind of textual tradition that one could find in Tibet.

55:21.622 --> 55:26.967
But he also studied with a number of the leading scholars of other traditions, other Tibetan Buddhist traditions as well.

55:28.348 --> 55:32.511
So in that sense, Dean is kind of on a very unusual background.

55:34.033 --> 55:43.201
And at what point do you start learning the language and really assimilating the culture, which everybody says that you know as much or more than anyone?

55:43.401 --> 55:43.781
No, no.

55:44.081 --> 55:50.447
It was largely because of the living with this family in Seattle when I was

55:50.933 --> 55:51.714
at the center.

55:52.575 --> 55:54.918
Like this guy who's here now, he's one of my oldest friends.

55:55.959 --> 55:56.100
Kiddo.

55:56.420 --> 55:57.021
Kiddo.

55:57.441 --> 56:03.329
He was the nephew of the guy who's become the Grand Abbot of all the Bumbos.

56:04.330 --> 56:05.612
These are non-Buddhists.

56:06.993 --> 56:09.577
And in a way I always joked about it.

56:13.041 --> 56:18.628
You don't mind if I jump around in the questions, because I usually have to go with what I'm thinking or I'll forget it.

56:19.064 --> 56:22.488
I saw it through on the tape recorder, but it's not a question.

56:22.528 --> 56:26.553
It's a short-term memory.

56:26.573 --> 56:32.419
You asked him whether he didn't mind you jumping around a little bit.

56:32.439 --> 56:32.559
Right.

56:33.581 --> 56:39.948
But just by the process of what you've been doing for 40 years, there are a number of great rarities here, though.

56:39.968 --> 56:41.229
Very precious.

56:42.150 --> 56:42.871
Not really.

56:43.071 --> 56:47.957
I mean, there are texts that often were

56:48.342 --> 56:51.026
who were given to me, like this.

56:51.927 --> 56:58.037
Yeah, but what about the... This is kind of a pocketbook, a pocketbook Tibetan book.

56:58.057 --> 57:08.032
But for instance, he has a copy of, and I've only seen one other copy in the library in Beijing, of one of the earliest Tibetan block prints, dated around 1300.

57:08.472 --> 57:08.693
Wow.

57:08.813 --> 57:13.039
And this is a block print of a Tibetan Buddhist esoteric text.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.683
It's a translation of a Sanskrit original.

57:16.473 --> 57:26.622
but this is the Tibetan translation, and was block printed by the imperial court in China of Mongol stock at around 1,300.

57:27.083 --> 57:29.285
And he has a copy of that particular block.

57:29.305 --> 57:34.810
The blocks, the wooden blocks, on which basis this print was printed, are gone.

57:34.830 --> 57:41.576
So as far as I know, there may only be two prints, two imprints of that particular copy around, one of which is in the collection.

57:41.596 --> 57:44.218
So another subject area I'm interested in

57:44.485 --> 57:45.847
in this book that I'm working on.

57:45.867 --> 57:55.178
It's not only preservation of content, but also the use of facsimiles and writing surfaces over extended periods.

57:55.198 --> 57:59.463
Now, the blocks, the original blocks, just like Gutenberg's type was gone with the press.

58:00.384 --> 58:04.690
Obviously, Shakespeare exists only in print.

58:05.290 --> 58:06.852
We don't have any manuscripts.

58:06.892 --> 58:10.276
This is kind of what you're talking about, right?

58:10.296 --> 58:14.121
The earliest Tibetan block print that I know dates from 1283.

58:14.658 --> 58:15.579
And the block, of course.

58:15.599 --> 58:19.806
And the blocks are gone, but I've seen one print of that particular text.

58:20.347 --> 58:22.811
And I also saw it in a library in Beijing.

58:22.871 --> 58:28.099
This text was brought from one of the libraries in Tibet in the early 1960s.

58:29.021 --> 58:33.868
This is not an interesting story.

58:34.509 --> 58:37.394
I think the subtext here, of course, is the cultural revolution.

58:37.414 --> 58:41.340
I mean, if there's no cultural revolution going on, there wouldn't be this

58:41.894 --> 58:45.118
The sense of urgency involved?

58:45.338 --> 58:52.186
Well, see, you know, we thought, when Leonard and I were there, that so much had been destroyed.

58:52.667 --> 58:54.729
And, of course, there was a great deal that was destroyed.

58:55.590 --> 59:02.678
Tibet, I don't know, you said once that you thought that Tibetans had... The capital was the most literate society in the world.

59:02.798 --> 59:03.159
Yeah, right.

59:03.519 --> 59:07.564
Based on, there's one census done in the 1260s.

59:08.573 --> 59:13.541
And I think they were talking about maybe 250, 300,000 sedentary Tibetans in San Tivet.

59:14.122 --> 59:31.088
And if you compare that to the average lama's output of about 15, 20 volumes per lama, per scholar, on such a kind of minute population base, you end up with a considerable amount of literacy.

59:31.128 --> 59:36.336
Not only that, but also the nomads, the peasants,

59:36.535 --> 59:50.007
And so all had to be at least, literally to the extent they could recite a prayer, recite prayers, or read a prayer from their prayer books, and perhaps more importantly, to read their contracts.

59:51.348 --> 59:58.274
Because they always, they used to lease or belong, or they belong to land nobility or monstros.

59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.716
For whom they worked there, for whom they heard of capital.

01:00:02.578 --> 01:00:06.441
And who did, they did business, made business transactions, and to whom they paid, had to pay taxes.

01:00:07.028 --> 01:00:17.725
Was there a deliberate policy to destroy this stuff, or was it mainly just... It was a disruption of the old, and it pertailed all throughout China.

01:00:17.745 --> 01:00:23.454
I mean, the Chinese culture was terribly damaged by the Cultural Revolution.

01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:30.645
But there were some very bright, interesting things that went on that we didn't know about in the 60s.

01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:34.892
Zhou Enlai, one of his

01:00:36.003 --> 01:00:37.284
I think an incredible act.

01:00:38.686 --> 01:00:38.806
Yes.

01:00:38.826 --> 01:00:39.086
Unbelievable.

01:00:39.106 --> 01:00:42.990
He said, well, you know, we shouldn't destroy everything blindly.

01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:44.652
He said this, though.

01:00:44.672 --> 01:00:52.500
He said, what we should do is, he said we should follow the Russian model, where you have living museums.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.944
You keep these living museums.

01:00:56.964 --> 01:00:57.945
You keep the libraries.

01:00:57.965 --> 01:00:59.487
You keep a few monks around.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:03.951
Like a zoo, almost.

01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:09.799
You know, he felt this was necessary, so he gave orders.

01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:25.055
Nobody knew this at the time, of course, but he gave orders to... That each province of China could have one monastery, great monastery, untouched.

01:01:25.296 --> 01:01:29.340
There would be guards on it, so that the Red Guards couldn't come and destroy it.

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:32.183
He chose

01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:39.661
For the province of Gansu, he chose the monastery of Lebrac.

01:01:39.681 --> 01:01:48.409
For the province of Qinghai, he chose the monastery of Kumbu.

01:01:50.051 --> 01:01:55.176
In Sichuan, he chose Dege.

01:01:55.256 --> 01:01:56.757
Each province was allowed to choose.

01:01:57.778 --> 01:01:59.620
Is this documented any place?

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:00.440
Has this been written?

01:02:00.601 --> 01:02:02.102
It could probably be found out.

01:02:02.673 --> 01:02:06.618
We don't have the documents that he actually signed, I don't think, yet.

01:02:06.658 --> 01:02:07.899
They're in the archives someplace.

01:02:07.979 --> 01:02:11.003
But has somebody written about this that I could cite as a reference?

01:02:11.063 --> 01:02:13.546
I'm not sure I can find out.

01:02:13.746 --> 01:02:25.941
And then finally, he said, for the TAR, he said, we will keep the Potala, because that's important for China.

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:30.587
And it didn't seem to be a policy, but they didn't touch it.

01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:40.627
Even though they touched Tachi Lumpo, which was the seat of the Panchet Lamas, they didn't touch Sakya, except cosmetically.

01:02:40.647 --> 01:02:44.832
Well, the northern, the northern palace was gone.

01:02:44.972 --> 01:02:46.333
But the southern, the Hakan Chela?

01:02:46.594 --> 01:02:47.034
The Hakan Chela.

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:47.975
The main library state.

01:02:48.616 --> 01:02:55.084
Which was a library that is, has been there since the 11th century.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.065
Where is this again?

01:02:56.085 --> 01:02:57.967
In Sakya, the west, the midwest of it.

01:02:58.087 --> 01:02:59.449
How do you spell it?

01:02:59.469 --> 01:03:00.270
N-A-K-Y-A.

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:01.907
And I spelled it for you upstairs.

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:02.588
Okay.

01:03:02.608 --> 01:03:04.270
There's a good reason for it, though.

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:12.180
Because it is only with Sakya around that the Chinese can claim that that was part of China, at least during the monastery.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.642
So it served their purposes.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.706
And that's probably why they did the portal.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:17.887
Totally.

01:03:17.907 --> 01:03:20.731
But everywhere else, they let them run wild.

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:25.597
I read a statistic that anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 monasteries were destroyed.

01:03:25.717 --> 01:03:26.057
Oh, yeah.

01:03:26.338 --> 01:03:26.698
Sure.

01:03:26.758 --> 01:03:28.941
Monasteries, temples, chapels.

01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:38.166
I've heard there were about 7,000 or so of them all over the Sven-Kolz area, and maybe 50.

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:44.015
How about books and elements of literature?

01:03:44.035 --> 01:03:44.836
That's a big story.

01:03:45.097 --> 01:03:47.521
That's another story, of course.

01:03:47.541 --> 01:03:50.705
How much of this literature has been lost in the last 40 years?

01:03:50.725 --> 01:03:52.909
Oh, an incredible amount has been lost.

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:56.074
How much rest did it begin with, and even more than an incredible amount?

01:03:56.214 --> 01:03:58.337
And then we know now,

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.524
that so much was saved.

01:04:02.544 --> 01:04:06.629
By this benign policy of Joe and Lye?

01:04:06.649 --> 01:04:07.931
No, no, just by people who were— People.

01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:09.092
By the locals.

01:04:09.112 --> 01:04:09.833
By the locals.

01:04:09.853 --> 01:04:19.506
They just put them in—like Caterford was telling me about this enormous Bumbo Lye Library in his area.

01:04:19.526 --> 01:04:25.333
He comes from an area called, uh, uh, called Sharkwell.

01:04:25.353 --> 01:04:28.257
And he said they had all of these books.

01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:35.596
And nobody knew what was in them, whether they're Buddhist or Bumbo.

01:04:35.616 --> 01:04:49.838
And the farmer, who had them, put them underneath the, at the top of the house, underneath the grass that they would feed to the animals.

01:04:50.218 --> 01:04:51.841
Gee.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:56.809
And this is one kind of anecdotal example that comes.

01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.670
And he said,

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:04.315
You know, they were just there, and nobody's going to look underneath the grass.

01:05:05.997 --> 01:05:15.385
And when Cater went there his last trip to China, he said, they said, do you want these?

01:05:17.227 --> 01:05:18.488
They were still underneath the grass.

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:23.832
And he said, they're this long.

01:05:23.852 --> 01:05:24.753
So he said, no.

01:05:25.514 --> 01:05:27.876
He didn't figure he could take those with him.

01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:35.046
And, I mean, books were magic to them.

01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:36.949
They had a magic power.

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:45.943
And, you know, to destroy them means that you're losing something of yourself.

01:05:45.963 --> 01:05:56.800
So, you had the fear of the red guard on the one side, and you had this idea that these were thin or

01:05:57.505 --> 01:06:03.511
They had some sort of magical power, and some of it was sustained.

01:06:03.531 --> 01:06:07.334
But the one thing that you should also remember is that the Red Guards were the only Chinese.

01:06:07.354 --> 01:06:11.618
They're also named Tibetans who were the worst Red Guards were the Tibetans.

01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:13.520
Let's be very clear about this.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.003
There's not a very proper thing to say.

01:06:16.523 --> 01:06:20.767
And that sounds terrible, really bad, because they knew what this stuff was.

01:06:20.807 --> 01:06:22.269
They came from other areas.

01:06:22.289 --> 01:06:25.892
They came from other areas, and they were looking for it too.

01:06:26.294 --> 01:06:27.555
They knew what they were looking for.

01:06:27.575 --> 01:06:32.721
And when they got to feed locals, they'd know where the chavos were, the small hermages, and they'd go in there and blow them up.

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:34.123
Oh, yeah.

01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:43.554
So this is... That's why... So when we think about the Taliban blowing up the Buddha, it's that plus times... Yeah.

01:06:43.714 --> 01:06:44.976
Whatever, you know.

01:06:45.016 --> 01:06:45.576
Pick a number.

01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:48.620
But the Tibetans themselves also were part of this.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.867
That's the big problem that the Tibetans face now, that they also were part of this.

01:06:55.555 --> 01:06:57.337
this entire spectacle.

01:06:57.357 --> 01:07:05.827
Just like for me and Janice, who used to be Red Gargan and have a dot-com company somewhere in Worcester, Oregon.

01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:06.067
Yeah.

01:07:06.428 --> 01:07:07.489
I mean, I wasn't that young.

01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:08.971
I was just 1962.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:11.053
I was, how old was I?

01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:11.894
Nineteen or whatever.

01:07:11.934 --> 01:07:17.381
But I don't remember, I mean, was it reported that we were really destroying irrepressible cultural?

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.183
I mean, was this kind of lost in the

01:07:19.484 --> 01:07:26.751
Well, I mean, when we think about today of the blowing up of the Buddhists, it's horrifying the world.

01:07:26.871 --> 01:07:28.153
Well, about ten years.

01:07:28.193 --> 01:07:28.613
Ten years.

01:07:28.633 --> 01:07:29.854
That was a revolution.

01:07:29.874 --> 01:07:29.995
Right.

01:07:30.015 --> 01:07:41.726
And when I was a student, when I started doing Tibetan in early 1970, I heard these horror stories that everything was being blown up, and numerous Chinese were being moved into Tibet, and the Tibetans were on a verge of disappearing.

01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:42.807
Of course, it wasn't true.

01:07:42.827 --> 01:07:44.549
It wasn't really part of the truth.

01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:47.432
The numerous Chinese never went to Tibet and never will go to Tibet.

01:07:48.037 --> 01:07:49.019
It's a terrible place.

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:52.444
It's not the best place to be for the Chinese.

01:07:52.745 --> 01:07:59.096
But it is true that the Red Guards, and not only the Chinese, but also many Tibetans, did blow up an awful lot.

01:07:59.637 --> 01:08:08.712
And let's face it, I mean, Tibetan civilization without books, without monasteries, is a peasant culture.

01:08:09.232 --> 01:08:13.239
It means because of the monasteries and their nomads.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:21.836
And because of their highly different culture, if you take these two aspects away of their civilization, they end up with the peasants and nomads.

01:08:22.757 --> 01:08:30.632
So the depth of the Tibetan civilization for that reason is very thin.

01:08:31.135 --> 01:08:40.966
If we equate, which I don't think we should, but if one equates, in part, civilization with literacy and book culture involved.

01:08:40.986 --> 01:08:45.370
There are all kinds of problems involved with that kind of equation as well.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:54.660
To get back to the gathering of books, so you were gathering stuff for the Library of Congress on the one hand, except for yourself, too, which is very interesting.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.185
No, the way it was for yourself, but for your own project was?

01:09:00.532 --> 01:09:05.638
When the project began, there were these funds that could be used almost for anything.

01:09:05.678 --> 01:09:07.381
We could have done bibliography projects.

01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:08.282
We could have done anything.

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:10.104
We just didn't have the foresight to do it.

01:09:12.407 --> 01:09:21.598
There was Congressman Dingell of Michigan, who's still there.

01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:22.239
Yeah, he is.

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:24.162
A marvelous old man.

01:09:25.543 --> 01:09:29.188
And he said, you know, we're exporting all this wheat.

01:09:29.742 --> 01:09:31.064
We should get something for it.

01:09:33.727 --> 01:09:50.869
And he said, why don't we set up a program where we can use the wheat money to increase Americans' knowledge of other countries.

01:09:50.889 --> 01:09:53.933
So he set up these, you know, Dingle did this, huh?

01:09:53.993 --> 01:09:54.354
Yes.

01:09:54.494 --> 01:09:56.897
Fabulous.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:25.800
So he's the author of the Public Law 480, usually with Public Law 480 legislation, which allowed for projects of cultural and, you know, cultural nature agreed to by both parties, could be part of this.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:26.040
And so

01:10:27.033 --> 01:10:28.755
Tibetan was not a special thing.

01:10:28.775 --> 01:10:37.582
It was just, you know, we collected books in Sanskrit, in Arabic, in Indonesian, in all of these languages.

01:10:38.243 --> 01:10:40.665
We had to catalog them because we could send them here.

01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:43.067
It would just clog up the system.

01:10:43.087 --> 01:10:47.892
So we set up these offices, which were called then public law for radio offices.

01:10:48.672 --> 01:10:49.733
We had them in Israel.

01:10:50.274 --> 01:10:56.179
We had them in Egypt, in Poland, in Yugoslavia.

01:10:56.902 --> 01:11:13.537
in India, Indonesia, and these offices would buy books and send to libraries in the United States with cataloging so they could get them into the system.

01:11:13.557 --> 01:11:16.920
And so this is where a lot of these big collections come from.

01:11:19.182 --> 01:11:24.647
Each congressman could also nominate

01:11:25.454 --> 01:11:37.169
libraries in his constituency to receive English language books from those countries that would help in understanding the host countries.

01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:40.033
He was a very wise man.

01:11:41.215 --> 01:11:45.701
So one of them was in the office, which had the most.

01:11:46.582 --> 01:11:53.210
At one point we owed one out of every eight rupees in circulation.

01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:54.432
We did.

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:58.612
Well, because we, we say, you know, we sold them wheat.

01:11:59.593 --> 01:11:59.833
Wheat.

01:12:00.314 --> 01:12:02.096
That's not very well known, that story.

01:12:02.116 --> 01:12:02.837
Yeah, right, right.

01:12:03.337 --> 01:12:09.504
Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote the largest cheque ever written.

01:12:09.524 --> 01:12:18.293
Now, he didn't write it, there's a trade, there's, uh, uh, yeah, giving, writing off the rupees

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:23.281
of the vast majority of the rupees that were owed to the U.S.

01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:26.244
government, to the Indian government.

01:12:26.264 --> 01:12:26.885
Was he a master?

01:12:27.265 --> 01:12:28.446
Yes, he was a master.

01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:30.529
He was a very wise man.

01:12:30.769 --> 01:12:35.294
And because it just became a horrible situation.

01:12:35.535 --> 01:12:42.603
But this allowed us to publish anything.

01:12:42.623 --> 01:12:45.106
We published facsimiles of Sanskrit manuscripts.

01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:45.546
We did.

01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:48.291
Oh, keep it, that's amazing.

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:48.872
Yeah.

01:12:49.192 --> 01:12:58.167
You could print something for, it was about four to five hundred dollars.

01:12:58.968 --> 01:13:02.755
You could print a book, a volume.

01:13:02.775 --> 01:13:06.741
These books were printed, you know, they started out with a lithographic.

01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:10.816
You write on this yellow paper and then you... Yeah, stone.

01:13:10.836 --> 01:13:11.998
It's stone paper.

01:13:12.018 --> 01:13:17.864
And then they graduated to printing on glass, you know, making glass negatives.

01:13:18.665 --> 01:13:22.649
And then finally they went to PhotoOpset.

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:36.525
And all of this was, you know, we figured that we could have them publish their own book cheaper.

01:13:37.602 --> 01:13:40.625
then we could photocopy it.

01:13:40.645 --> 01:13:47.152
So, every library that we gave, you know, we gave the option to any library, Harvard didn't take it.

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:49.294
That's too bad.

01:13:49.314 --> 01:13:52.097
Because... Short time.

01:13:52.117 --> 01:14:06.192
So, libraries like Yale, Virginia, Washington, Berkeley, Indiana, Texas, all...

01:14:06.593 --> 01:14:12.261
signed up Chicago, Pennsylvania, all were members of the program.

01:14:12.822 --> 01:14:16.067
And the books just came in and came in and came in.

01:14:16.668 --> 01:14:19.452
And of course they were a problem because of the size.

01:14:20.854 --> 01:14:35.014
They didn't like the blue sleeve books because if you put them through the return chute, the pages get out of order.

01:14:35.652 --> 01:14:38.376
Right now we still have this whole thing.

01:14:39.157 --> 01:14:41.059
Unless they're bound, they don't circulate.

01:14:41.359 --> 01:14:42.741
So the books are like in prison.

01:14:45.004 --> 01:14:46.346
Even here, right?

01:14:46.526 --> 01:14:47.087
We have a few.

01:14:47.127 --> 01:14:48.969
We only have... So what's the solution to that?

01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:51.693
We have about 2,000 volumes in the library.

01:14:51.713 --> 01:14:54.417
And how old is the program at Harvard?

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:56.259
Seven years.

01:14:56.379 --> 01:14:57.340
I've been here seven years now.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:57.801
So that's it.

01:14:57.821 --> 01:14:59.083
So it's a new program.

01:14:59.103 --> 01:15:00.124
You wouldn't have it without...

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:03.458
His contributions, basically.

01:15:03.478 --> 01:15:05.020
No, they were there before.

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.323
We had 2,000 bosses before.

01:15:07.343 --> 01:15:12.289
They were exchanged on the leave with the University of Texas.

01:15:12.309 --> 01:15:13.150
See what happened.

01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:14.632
I'm reading in the New York Times here.

01:15:14.652 --> 01:15:16.475
It says he was the first Tibetan expert.

01:15:16.495 --> 01:15:19.318
He literally made Tibetan studies possible.

01:15:19.398 --> 01:15:20.139
Well, that's true.

01:15:20.259 --> 01:15:22.863
The chairman of the Asian Languages and Cultures Department.

01:15:23.564 --> 01:15:25.827
We had no Tibetan books.

01:15:25.927 --> 01:15:26.507
I'm calling you.

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:28.951
Den Shung said, go and find them.

01:15:28.971 --> 01:15:30.853
Find the important books and get them published.

01:15:31.002 --> 01:15:31.823
Yeah, that's what he said.

01:15:31.844 --> 01:15:34.809
That's what he said, and that's what you did.

01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:37.153
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:15:37.313 --> 01:15:41.260
Well, it was his idea.

01:15:42.102 --> 01:15:43.785
So I went around to the Library of Congress.

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:46.369
A lot of people have good ideas.

01:15:48.113 --> 01:15:52.280
But you have to figure out a way that the bureaucrats will accept.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.382
Bureaucracy is all.

01:15:53.648 --> 01:16:00.637
I went around and there was a field director there, was a woman named... Are we talking in Washington now or so?

01:16:00.877 --> 01:16:01.037
Huh?

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:03.180
You said you went around, wait, where are you at this point?

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.082
In New Delhi, I was a student.

01:16:06.784 --> 01:16:07.866
It worked, it worked, it worked.

01:16:07.946 --> 01:16:08.586
Was it 1960?

01:16:08.626 --> 01:16:10.228
65, 66.

01:16:10.789 --> 01:16:21.242
I went around and I said, you know, I've been told you're making terrible mistakes on the Romanization of Tibet.

01:16:21.593 --> 01:16:24.617
They were putting A's after every letter.

01:16:25.358 --> 01:16:34.089
And Lopanamda, the Bumbo Rama, said, look, you've got to get them to understand.

01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:36.212
He said, they won't listen to me.

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:39.275
He was just the high law.

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:40.998
I'm just a local.

01:16:41.018 --> 01:16:44.242
So I went around and said, you know, I think you'd better fix this.

01:16:44.462 --> 01:16:45.383
And so they did.

01:16:45.403 --> 01:16:50.790
And then I was asked to start making romanization tables.

01:16:51.496 --> 01:16:53.139
to get things into the computer.

01:16:55.142 --> 01:17:09.485
So he did the Tibetan and I did tables for everything from Dvehi, the language of Sri Lanka, I mean of the Maldives, to Sindhi.

01:17:11.648 --> 01:17:17.858
I did probably twenty-five Romanization tables.

01:17:18.496 --> 01:17:23.581
and then you have to get them through the scholarly community so that they will adopt it.

01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:26.224
But for my purposes, explain what a romanization table is?

01:17:26.324 --> 01:17:34.592
A romanization table is so you can... So is that a stone of... Yeah, no, it's so you can key it into the computer.

01:17:34.973 --> 01:17:37.215
So you don't have to... You can't use the script.

01:17:37.775 --> 01:17:40.178
You can't use the script.

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.460
So Tibetan, we use Wiley.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.561
They don't like Wiley.

01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:47.305
They use another different system.

01:17:47.993 --> 01:17:51.839
So that the, it represents more or less what, what is it.

01:17:51.859 --> 01:17:52.139
I see.

01:17:52.159 --> 01:17:54.783
Okay, I understand.

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:54.884
Wow.

01:17:54.904 --> 01:17:58.850
So, so, so, just using the Latin alphabet to represent the Tibetan.

01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:00.713
I see.

01:18:00.733 --> 01:18:00.833
Yeah.

01:18:00.853 --> 01:18:07.423
Uh, so this was what we were, we were doing, but Tibetan was just a small part of it that I was, I was interested in.

01:18:07.443 --> 01:18:08.825
Right.

01:18:08.845 --> 01:18:08.945
Okay.

01:18:08.965 --> 01:18:11.830
Hey, Cameron.

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:11.990
Okay.

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:16.617
So, hey, I found that other volume of the, uh, Nimei Yubim, it's on the table.

01:18:16.968 --> 01:18:17.508
Okay.

01:18:17.528 --> 01:18:21.932
And another volume of the, uh, of the, uh, Jocelyn Pojo.

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:30.800
So, about a decade later, a little over, about a decade later, you, uh, rose to the... Yeah.

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:35.304
Uh, how many, how many people were working at, about a hundred, a hundred and twenty?

01:18:35.364 --> 01:18:36.164
A hundred and seventeen.

01:18:36.184 --> 01:18:36.905
A hundred and seventeen.

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:43.671
That was the max, and... So, he came, uh, off the street, ten years, and ten years later, you ran the place.

01:18:43.691 --> 01:18:46.333
And then from there, I, it just got too complicated,

01:18:47.107 --> 01:18:57.898
to stay in India because of the whole business of the ties that one builds up.

01:18:57.918 --> 01:18:59.080
Too many visa cases.

01:19:01.442 --> 01:19:05.687
And so I moved to— But this was out for twenty-some-odd years.

01:19:07.108 --> 01:19:11.433
I moved to Indonesia, where we did some interesting projects.

01:19:11.453 --> 01:19:14.616
There we were working on Mele, old

01:19:15.406 --> 01:19:20.853
not old, but modern Malay literature, written by a Chinese, which is called Veronica.

01:19:21.714 --> 01:19:26.360
And there were libraries that had all of this stuff.

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:33.148
You know, in the United States we didn't have it, we gave everybody sort of a look down their nose at us, you know, cheap fiction.

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:39.316
And so we built up a library of this on microphones.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:41.899
That was one of the projects.

01:19:41.939 --> 01:19:43.962
We were also working on romanization.

01:19:44.752 --> 01:19:47.675
for Buddhist language or .

01:19:47.735 --> 01:19:55.723
But still, you seem to have been embarked on doing two different .

01:19:55.843 --> 01:19:57.044
That was my work.

01:19:57.605 --> 01:19:59.667
One for yourself and one for L.C., though.

01:19:59.687 --> 01:20:00.027
Yeah, right.

01:20:00.087 --> 01:20:08.496
And I'm curious as to how you, what motivated you to do it, you see, all of it, as resulted in .

01:20:08.516 --> 01:20:13.881
Well, it was just because I was interested in, and I continued to

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:17.496
to collect from China all throughout the period.

01:20:17.536 --> 01:20:25.811
I had that for yourself, or for Elsie, or for myself, because by that time I was in Egypt or in Indonesia, and the books would come.

01:20:27.133 --> 01:20:31.882
So I have, I think, probably the best collection of Chinese books from the eighties.

01:20:32.223 --> 01:20:38.434
So you must have known that you were involved, I mean, clearly you had to know that you embarked on a program of preservation.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.383
What were you thinking about as you were putting all this stuff together?

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:57.883
If you're not an antiquarian, and you're not a collector, and you're not a librarian, per se, although I think that could be argued, you certainly are an archivist of some... I think we could define you... I was interested, and I thought, stupidly, that I could read these books, all of them.

01:20:58.003 --> 01:20:58.924
Oh, you can.

01:20:59.084 --> 01:20:59.905
Read all of them, right?

01:20:59.925 --> 01:21:01.287
It's enough for all of them.

01:21:01.307 --> 01:21:02.228
There's just too many.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:07.054
Tibetan studies, in the last three years, Tibetan studies,

01:21:07.507 --> 01:21:11.852
There's no resemblance whatsoever now as what it did 30 years ago.

01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:12.173
No resemblance.

01:21:12.193 --> 01:21:12.853
And why is that?

01:21:13.054 --> 01:21:15.056
Because of the enormous amount of literature.

01:21:15.076 --> 01:21:15.917
That's an album.

01:21:16.758 --> 01:21:24.767
Even 15 years ago, anybody who is content and interested could have a kind of an overview of what was there.

01:21:24.787 --> 01:21:33.998
That's impossible at this point in time that one person could do something like this with a culture, a major world culture.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.141
Interesting.

01:21:36.161 --> 01:21:37.142
It's fascinating.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.494
It's amazing.

01:21:38.514 --> 01:21:38.875
It's amazing.

01:21:39.095 --> 01:21:39.776
It is amazing.

01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:45.863
And you just seem so, uh, modest about it.

01:21:45.883 --> 01:21:46.884
There's nothing nice about it.

01:21:46.904 --> 01:21:47.945
Yeah, it's wonderful.

01:21:47.965 --> 01:21:49.147
Wonderful.

01:21:49.167 --> 01:21:57.416
You said you recorded in the Globe piece, um, as saying that you would like to see all this material go back to Chicago, to China?

01:21:57.436 --> 01:21:58.678
Yeah, that, that... Why is that?

01:21:58.698 --> 01:21:59.378
Why China?

01:21:59.399 --> 01:21:59.839
I mean...

01:22:00.106 --> 01:22:05.032
Because they don't have all of this stuff, they can be trusted in your view?

01:22:06.473 --> 01:22:07.775
Well, eventually they can.

01:22:07.795 --> 01:22:13.321
I mean, you could get some admiration to take place here.

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:14.803
Of course.

01:22:14.823 --> 01:22:17.226
I mean, I could see something terrible happening here.

01:22:18.747 --> 01:22:22.692
You know, already we're going to nuke Iraq.

01:22:22.892 --> 01:22:27.177
Something bad, yeah.

01:22:27.578 --> 01:22:29.079
Who knows?

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:36.646
I mean, I just think that we need to heal that divide.

01:22:38.067 --> 01:22:41.811
Where Buddhism will survive is in China, not here.

01:22:45.074 --> 01:22:47.096
But this is also a scholarly resource, though.

01:22:47.116 --> 01:22:50.819
But you're copying it, so it's not like the information goes back to China.

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:53.321
I mean, it will all be copied before it goes.

01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:57.585
And we're going to put sets of the scans

01:22:58.443 --> 01:23:06.513
In a number of places, I sort of thought of two Buddhist centers and two academic.

01:23:06.994 --> 01:23:24.096
Obviously, we might want to have Harvard be one and some other place where the raw scans would stay and somebody would ensure that they would be possible.

01:23:24.413 --> 01:23:33.642
one software to the next and one computer system to the next, somebody's making sure that the stuff is migrating successfully, because that's a huge issue as you know today.

01:23:35.004 --> 01:23:40.349
You know, Jeff is talking now about DVDs, and I said, well, how do we know that DVD is here to stay?

01:23:45.014 --> 01:23:52.161
It'll be something better, but we've got to have somebody who's going to migrate this stuff.

01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:53.442
And Harvard

01:23:53.658 --> 01:24:01.646
The only problem I have with Harvard is, is there the will and the commitment to preserve the digital file?

01:24:03.327 --> 01:24:05.309
That's the question.

01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:10.234
You know, Cornell has some experience in this area, of course.

01:24:10.294 --> 01:24:12.897
They've done Southeast Asian stuff.

01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:13.017
Yeah.

01:24:13.037 --> 01:24:14.158
You know John Badgley?

01:24:14.178 --> 01:24:15.459
I don't know Badgley.

01:24:15.479 --> 01:24:17.201
I've talked to John Dean up there.

01:24:17.221 --> 01:24:20.644
I do mean to talk to Badgley at some point.

01:24:20.894 --> 01:24:23.157
Oh, that Cambodian project.

01:24:23.177 --> 01:24:27.464
Yeah, I'm writing one of the Cambodian projects in this next book.

01:24:27.484 --> 01:24:28.305
You've talked to Judy?

01:24:28.645 --> 01:24:29.767
I haven't talked to Judy yet.

01:24:29.807 --> 01:24:34.434
I intend to, but I've been to Cornell and a number of interviews out there.

01:24:34.474 --> 01:24:36.357
Mainly I wanted to know what they were doing with the stuff.

01:24:36.437 --> 01:24:40.463
This goes back five or six years, you know, that I've been on this.

01:24:40.984 --> 01:24:43.507
Yeah, well... Is she still there?

01:24:43.708 --> 01:24:44.349
Is she still a friend?

01:24:44.369 --> 01:24:44.930
I don't think so.

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:47.013
I think she's gone off to another job.

01:24:47.133 --> 01:24:48.515
I'm going to search for her.

01:24:48.535 --> 01:24:49.536
You can find her.

01:24:49.556 --> 01:24:50.698
You can find her, I'm sure.

01:24:51.185 --> 01:24:54.409
This Google is really something else.

01:24:54.789 --> 01:25:00.556
I have a book coming out this fall, just on book hunting, and I just say, it's Google.

01:25:00.976 --> 01:25:03.760
It's unbelievable.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.120
Yeah.

01:25:05.241 --> 01:25:06.543
I just, I love that.

01:25:08.225 --> 01:25:09.686
But we cannot hide anymore.

01:25:09.706 --> 01:25:10.287
No.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:14.272
If you have an aboveboard job, there's no way you can hide.

01:25:14.632 --> 01:25:14.912
That's right.

01:25:15.553 --> 01:25:16.614
And you're always successful.

01:25:16.634 --> 01:25:18.897
I think that's very...

01:25:19.822 --> 01:25:24.947
But the thing is, if you hit, I'm feeling lucky, ninety percent of the time it gives you exactly what you're looking for.

01:25:25.007 --> 01:25:28.931
Instead of even wading through everything else, I'll just give you the one right there.

01:25:28.951 --> 01:25:30.292
It's such a marvelous search engine.

01:25:30.312 --> 01:25:31.433
It's unbelievable.

01:25:32.434 --> 01:25:41.463
I was at a thing here, a digital reality, it was two years ago, Tim Brenner's lead, he's the guy that invented the World Wide Web, and he said, all I use is Google.

01:25:41.483 --> 01:25:43.324
And that was enough of a test for me.

01:25:44.225 --> 01:25:45.426
And it is fantastic.

01:25:45.446 --> 01:25:49.170
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:25:49.741 --> 01:25:51.363
See, these were things that we worked with.

01:25:51.383 --> 01:25:58.453
We worked with that Cambodian project when I was in Indonesia with Judy and John Badgley.

01:25:58.473 --> 01:26:00.295
Badgley, where is he now?

01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:02.197
He's out at the University of Washington.

01:26:03.059 --> 01:26:04.821
He's somebody worthwhile talking to.

01:26:04.981 --> 01:26:07.645
B-A-D-G-L-E-Y.

01:26:08.105 --> 01:26:08.926
B-A-D-G-L-E-Y.

01:26:09.047 --> 01:26:09.888
John, right?

01:26:09.908 --> 01:26:11.249
Yeah, he's a Burma specialist.

01:26:12.671 --> 01:26:13.532
Where is he?

01:26:13.552 --> 01:26:15.936
You'll find him later.

01:26:16.016 --> 01:26:16.997
He is...

01:26:18.547 --> 01:26:35.547
Somebody told me that he is filling in for, no, Judy has gone off, spent a couple of years in Vietnam, Judy Henchie, and John is filling in for her.

01:26:36.508 --> 01:26:40.954
That title, by the way, is, those are the names of the lines in front of the New York Public Library.

01:26:41.454 --> 01:26:42.916
Ah, yes, I believe that.

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:45.599
Some people think it's a Jane Austen novel.

01:26:45.679 --> 01:26:47.001
No.

01:26:49.630 --> 01:27:02.049
And it's a fun book.

01:27:04.353 --> 01:27:12.465
I'm sorry, Gene, I keep bouncing around here, but I'm reading the Times pieces, which I'm amazed I didn't

01:27:13.289 --> 01:27:15.573
So China is the place.

01:27:15.613 --> 01:27:16.935
It's the final resting place.

01:27:17.155 --> 01:27:19.619
This is an artifactual decision.

01:27:21.242 --> 01:27:22.965
We have the scans.

01:27:22.985 --> 01:27:28.774
But it's going to be some time before the developing world can really use these digital images.

01:27:30.316 --> 01:27:32.520
A lot of the technology is going fast.

01:27:36.006 --> 01:27:38.149
There's a real fear that

01:27:38.939 --> 01:27:40.260
You know, this is something we don't want.

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.782
We want the ink print books.

01:27:41.802 --> 01:27:43.904
We want to feel them, we want to smell them.

01:27:45.566 --> 01:27:47.148
You don't buy into that?

01:27:47.168 --> 01:27:47.368
No.

01:27:48.009 --> 01:27:49.370
Oh, I certainly do.

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.831
You do.

01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:50.171
Oh, yes.

01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:51.272
You do buy into it.

01:27:51.292 --> 01:27:51.512
Oh, yes.

01:27:51.552 --> 01:27:52.053
Yes, you have to.

01:27:52.153 --> 01:27:52.734
I like books.

01:27:52.774 --> 01:27:53.495
Yeah, you have to.

01:27:53.575 --> 01:27:54.636
What about newspapers?

01:27:55.777 --> 01:27:57.379
Well, you know, Nick Baker and all this.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.083
I don't read newspapers.

01:28:01.103 --> 01:28:01.904
I'm fine with that.

01:28:02.624 --> 01:28:04.226
But then again, I hate to see them.

01:28:04.426 --> 01:28:07.950
He'd like to have them bound and preserved in the library.

01:28:08.302 --> 01:28:10.644
Yeah, but you know, the BPL saves all their newspapers.

01:28:10.664 --> 01:28:11.705
I mean, it's not that hard.

01:28:11.765 --> 01:28:14.688
If you can say, why shouldn't there be a hard?

01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:18.012
The New York Times does not keep a hard copy of its own paper.

01:28:18.512 --> 01:28:20.254
That's unbelievable to me.

01:28:20.274 --> 01:28:23.737
Not even, and they can use color now, so they didn't even keep a copy of the color.

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:28.242
I mean, that's, but that's a philosophy.

01:28:28.282 --> 01:28:30.344
That's philosophy.

01:28:30.384 --> 01:28:36.570
But when you show me a book that is like this, and it's loose-leaf, there has to be something there in the reading

01:28:37.377 --> 01:28:49.731
Well, because you read it, of course, horizontally, and with both hands you lift the page and fold it over with your backside.

01:28:49.751 --> 01:28:56.899
And then again, you read to the front, and with both hands, it's not like flipping a page.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:04.708
But what we're doing now with our scans is we're able to print from those PDFs.

01:29:05.288 --> 01:29:06.810
We're able to print a book.

01:29:07.212 --> 01:29:13.858
at, what do you say, seven dollars a volume at Kinko's.

01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:17.042
Seven dollars a volume?

01:29:17.282 --> 01:29:21.166
Yeah.

01:29:21.186 --> 01:29:22.847
That's cheap, isn't it?

01:29:22.867 --> 01:29:23.728
I think it's cheap.

01:29:23.868 --> 01:29:25.630
Make sure you use good paper, though, too.

01:29:26.331 --> 01:29:27.972
Make sure you use archival paper.

01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:33.698
That's probably the cheapest grade paper, too.

01:29:34.859 --> 01:29:37.101
Well, I don't know.

01:29:37.773 --> 01:29:41.518
And from a Tibetan journal, did they run this or anything?

01:29:41.558 --> 01:29:42.459
Yeah.

01:29:42.479 --> 01:29:43.841
I'll put some David's bit.

01:29:43.941 --> 01:29:49.368
Well, they're all going, you know, the stuff that we've got.

01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:54.534
You know, I'm having problems with figuring out what to do.

01:29:54.674 --> 01:29:59.100
We have the original, and then we have the reprint.

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:07.290
The original is so fragile, and then the reprint is going to be that way.

01:30:10.257 --> 01:30:13.922
We had discussed at some point the importance of a mentor in reading.

01:30:15.463 --> 01:30:22.512
That so many Tibetan books, even if you can read in a language, can't really be picked up and read.

01:30:22.532 --> 01:30:24.315
You need somebody to explain them.

01:30:25.216 --> 01:30:28.760
This continues to be part of the... It still is very much.

01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:31.684
I mean, you try to understand.

01:30:31.704 --> 01:30:36.049
I mean, there's always going to be words that you're not going to understand.

01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:39.133
If you take a great scholar like Pema Karpo,

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:46.727
I wouldn't want to try to translate him without somebody who knows his dialect.

01:30:47.948 --> 01:30:55.395
He wrote in a dialect, the Kongbo dialect, and if you don't know the dialect, you miss.

01:30:57.236 --> 01:30:58.678
What are you missing, exactly?

01:30:58.698 --> 01:31:00.960
You miss what it really means.

01:31:02.121 --> 01:31:04.103
It's just like Chinese.

01:31:04.123 --> 01:31:08.146
It's just one, two, three, four syllables.

01:31:08.607 --> 01:31:10.268
So is it possible if you're

01:31:10.923 --> 01:31:13.606
readers, the mentors die out?

01:31:13.967 --> 01:31:17.672
What's the tradition of replication with people?

01:31:17.692 --> 01:31:20.495
That is a problem.

01:31:20.635 --> 01:31:25.662
When we talk about Cambodia, Khmer Rouge and all that, they killed all these monks.

01:31:26.483 --> 01:31:29.627
And when you talk about palm leaf manuscripts, there was a whole tradition there.

01:31:29.667 --> 01:31:33.572
You had to have these monks who were the copyists.

01:31:33.907 --> 01:31:35.829
Have you been in touch with Peter Skilling?

01:31:35.849 --> 01:31:36.330
Yeah, we have.

01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:37.752
You should be in touch with Peter Skilling.

01:31:37.772 --> 01:31:38.593
He's from Bangkok.

01:31:38.613 --> 01:31:42.538
And he has put together an enormous library of Peter Skilling.

01:31:43.619 --> 01:31:44.180
How do we spell?

01:31:44.621 --> 01:31:46.423
S-K-I-L-L-I-N-G.

01:31:46.743 --> 01:31:48.205
And where is he from?

01:31:48.225 --> 01:31:48.586
Canadian.

01:31:48.786 --> 01:31:49.407
He's Canadian.

01:31:50.168 --> 01:31:50.869
He's in Bangkok now?

01:31:50.889 --> 01:31:51.589
He's in Bangkok.

01:31:51.609 --> 01:31:59.339
He has a huge library of palm-leaf manuscripts from Burma, Cambodia.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.741
From Burma.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:20.096
What happened is when the Kurens started looting the Burmese monasteries in the Burman area, all these manuscripts came across the border in order to be exchanged for guns.

01:32:20.877 --> 01:32:27.462
The first things that came were the gold on blue, the pretty ones.

01:32:27.562 --> 01:32:30.525
You could get a bit of ammunition for one of those.

01:32:31.315 --> 01:32:35.402
But then they started palm leaves.

01:32:35.963 --> 01:32:36.824
And it was a question.

01:32:37.044 --> 01:32:41.191
Is it worse to say that you're buying them?

01:32:41.211 --> 01:32:42.834
Because then more would get stolen.

01:32:43.375 --> 01:32:46.580
Yeah, that's right.

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:53.552
But they were being sold off page by page for people to illuminate.

01:32:53.632 --> 01:32:54.353
And when was this?

01:32:55.582 --> 01:33:00.951
About the same time as the... No, this was 1978.

01:33:01.572 --> 01:33:04.356
About the same time as the Pol Pot thing.

01:33:05.558 --> 01:33:09.785
And the currents are Christians.

01:33:11.268 --> 01:33:14.974
And they were in rebellion against the...
