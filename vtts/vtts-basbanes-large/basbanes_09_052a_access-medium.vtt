00:03.473 --> 00:04.174
paper's running.

00:04.214 --> 00:06.577
We're talking to David McCauley.

00:06.597 --> 00:09.401
Thank you for just describing all these things, if you would.

00:09.421 --> 00:10.302
Let's start with that.

00:10.463 --> 00:13.006
Yeah, this is my fake childhood, you see here.

00:13.567 --> 00:14.989
It's like the childhood I never had.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.250
We left England.

00:16.471 --> 00:17.232
I did have it, actually.

00:17.252 --> 00:24.742
We left England when I was almost 11, so I left a lot of stuff behind, books and some of my favorite things, just because we couldn't bring that much stuff with us.

00:25.763 --> 00:32.873
So, I don't know, maybe that was part of the motive, the motivation for, over the years, acquiring odds and ends

00:33.173 --> 00:34.815
There's no rhyme or reason to it.

00:34.855 --> 00:37.598
I've always liked trains, steam engines.

00:38.058 --> 00:39.820
Grew up in England watching them.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.782
Whenever I could, I would go and watch the trains.

00:42.403 --> 00:43.864
So that's what theirs are for.

00:43.904 --> 00:46.747
The soldiers, obviously, I had some soldiers in England, but these are all newer.

00:47.528 --> 00:48.449
It's just stuff.

00:48.509 --> 00:51.813
I mean, it's just the kind of stuff that I like to be surrounded by in the place where I work.

00:52.353 --> 00:58.540
I count 16 shelves going up, one, two, three, four, five compartments going left to right.

00:59.077 --> 01:07.667
And I guess what I'm looking at are toy soldiers, we're looking at animals, we're looking at... You've got... ...vehicle... Yeah, you name it.

01:07.767 --> 01:08.188
It's in here.

01:08.208 --> 01:15.877
Bits of ceramic, cardboard models, some rewards, some... I mean, just stuff.

01:16.237 --> 01:26.610
It's... It's a mammoth that actually... Would you describe yourself as a collector?

01:26.730 --> 01:26.890
No.

01:27.494 --> 01:29.256
No, pack rat.

01:29.316 --> 01:29.897
Pack rat.

01:29.917 --> 01:32.641
Collector is too dignified a term.

01:32.661 --> 01:38.148
An accumulator, a pack rat, yeah, the sort of lint trap of humanity.

01:38.168 --> 01:40.611
I mean, this kind of stuff, just, I'm attracted to it.

01:40.812 --> 01:43.035
So are the icons of the youth, perhaps?

01:43.055 --> 01:43.675
They are.

01:43.836 --> 01:46.740
I think they are, in some ways.

01:46.860 --> 01:56.893
I think having to leave stuff behind that I liked made me, you know, left a desire to sort of reacquire it at some point, I mean, subconsciously.

01:57.312 --> 02:00.176
I don't think it's, you know, too heavy.

02:00.276 --> 02:05.584
But I've always liked and admired little things.

02:05.885 --> 02:07.287
I mean, I like to look at things.

02:07.307 --> 02:09.230
I like to take the time to look at little things.

02:09.250 --> 02:15.640
So I tend to, you know, sort of hold onto them, to revisit them.

02:16.060 --> 02:22.510
And I had boxes of these things in the old studio, or a 12-inch wide standard shelf like these.

02:22.861 --> 02:24.704
filled with stuff, and you couldn't see any of it.

02:24.824 --> 02:32.975
So when I moved to this studio, I actually had these shelves made so that you would never have more than two or three things deep, and you could actually see them.

02:32.995 --> 02:33.837
So you could see everything.

02:33.897 --> 02:34.958
Yeah, so you could see everything.

02:34.978 --> 02:43.871
And I do, surprisingly, every once in a while, just turn around and look at the shelves or take something off the shelves with no rhyme or reason.

02:43.991 --> 02:45.794
It just attracts my attention.

02:46.435 --> 02:48.177
Is there, in your view, a unity to it?

02:50.350 --> 02:55.597
I'm wondering, you know, I see some connection here, I think, between some of your work.

02:55.617 --> 02:58.481
Well, some of the pieces directly relate to my work.

02:58.561 --> 03:03.607
I mean, there are black and white things and there are mammoth things and obviously things that, mostly those things I've been given.

03:03.648 --> 03:15.203
There are the, you know, the rubber masks from Spitting Image, just because I admire that kind of sapphire much of the time.

03:18.107 --> 03:19.969
The soldiers are nice because you can line them up.

03:20.759 --> 03:27.186
And no matter how chaotic your life gets, you always appear to be in control, which is a very nice feeling.

03:27.206 --> 03:34.894
So if you can turn around and see 35 soldiers all lined up in a row, somehow, as chaotic as life gets, it can't be that bad, because they're still in a row.

03:35.194 --> 03:40.480
And there's this sort of false sense of security, undoubtedly, that comes from that.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.682
Do you prowl flea markets?

03:42.922 --> 03:44.304
No, no.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.627
No, I'm not even a flea market person.

03:48.839 --> 03:56.448
These are things that I have just gone out and bought in stores as much as they are things that I've just acquired.

03:56.488 --> 03:57.850
People say, well, why don't you have this?

03:57.890 --> 04:00.212
You seem to like this kind of stuff.

04:00.332 --> 04:04.698
The Mammoth, the Harry Mammoth on the second shelf over there is the newest edition.

04:04.718 --> 04:12.427
And that was actually brought by a fellow from California who came to visit and found it probably in some kind of junk store.

04:12.447 --> 04:15.370
I said, you know, I know the guy who should have this.

04:16.111 --> 04:17.032
And he brought it with him.

04:17.052 --> 04:18.694
My father made the windmill.

04:19.282 --> 04:20.323
So, and it works.

04:20.403 --> 04:24.187
I mean, it actually, when you turn the blades of the windmill, the grinding wheel is inside turn.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.688
It's all geared and so on.

04:26.349 --> 04:32.935
He, like me, is fascinated with how things work and also loves the act of building models.

04:33.515 --> 04:39.101
The ship model I built when I was doing ship because I knew nothing about ships and I certainly knew nothing about rigging.

04:39.641 --> 04:47.989
So I decided that I would get a model that would be big enough where I would have to install the rigging and therefore I could learn what on earth all these ropes did.

04:48.526 --> 04:50.228
That was in preparation.

04:50.288 --> 04:51.909
That was in preparation for the book.

04:53.131 --> 04:56.974
Prior to that, when I drew a ship, I just drew lots of ropes all over the place.

04:57.014 --> 04:59.437
It looks like it's written.

05:00.098 --> 05:07.004
As with all of these books, or many of them, it's really teach yourself the subject.

05:07.084 --> 05:11.229
Is that the ship that you used in the book?

05:11.249 --> 05:12.550
No, that's the same.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.652
The caravels were smaller.

05:15.239 --> 05:17.101
And then, of course, you get a skeleton.

05:17.121 --> 05:18.122
Is that an authentic skeleton?

05:18.142 --> 05:19.024
Oh, that's a real skeleton.

05:19.044 --> 05:20.746
Yeah, a whole bunch of skeletons downstairs.

05:21.086 --> 05:27.514
I bought that years ago in anticipation of doing the book on the body, building the body.

05:27.634 --> 05:28.995
It's a building.

05:29.055 --> 05:29.556
I may do it.

05:29.636 --> 05:30.798
I just haven't gotten around to it.

05:31.018 --> 05:37.045
Some of the ideas are, you know, 10, 20 years old by the time they get to.

05:38.003 --> 05:43.352
This book, which I had a galley for...are there finished copies for this yet, by the way?

05:43.372 --> 05:46.899
I don't want to run this story before the book can be purchased.

05:46.919 --> 05:49.884
It's supposed to be shipped, I think, on the 15th of September.

05:50.605 --> 05:53.470
By the time this runs, it'll be just about that time.

05:53.971 --> 05:58.599
But which book is this for you, in terms of numbers, chronology?

05:58.619 --> 06:02.285
How many have they now published?

06:02.486 --> 06:03.167
Good question.

06:04.143 --> 06:06.105
I don't know how to count it.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.126
Okay, but approximately?

06:07.146 --> 06:09.869
I think it's the 17th or 16th or 17th something.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.291
Over how, and when was the first book?

06:11.311 --> 06:14.754
Well, it started, Cathedral is the first book, and it's 25 years old next year.

06:15.235 --> 06:15.395
Wow.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.780
So will your publisher be doing a 25th anniversary edition?

06:19.800 --> 06:30.011
We're talking about doing something, a 25th anniversary edition of Cathedral, but I'm actually more interested in doing, I mean, what do you do with a 25th anniversary edition?

06:30.031 --> 06:31.593
Write a forward edition?

06:31.613 --> 06:33.795
Write a forward, right, and reissue it or something like that.

06:33.978 --> 06:37.884
I would much rather do a book on how the book was done that accompanies it.

06:39.266 --> 06:43.111
But I don't want to do it just on cathedral, because I didn't know very much when I was doing cathedral.

06:43.131 --> 06:47.758
I mean, I sort of stumbled through that process and did the best I could.

06:47.778 --> 06:55.609
But if I'm going to go to the trouble of making a book about how the building books were created, I'm going to have to include all the building books, you know, City, Pyramid, Cowan.

06:55.629 --> 06:56.771
And I think that's what I'm going to do.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.294
I'm just working on it this morning a little bit.

06:59.615 --> 07:00.075
A how-to.

07:00.536 --> 07:01.858
A how-to.

07:03.037 --> 07:04.579
So how old were you then?

07:04.619 --> 07:06.582
I guess it's an indirect way to imagine how old you are now.

07:06.663 --> 07:07.404
I was 26.

07:08.065 --> 07:09.106
I'm 50 now.

07:10.549 --> 07:11.390
So I've been at it since.

07:11.410 --> 07:12.652
So you've been at it for half of your life.

07:12.672 --> 07:13.633
72, yeah.

07:13.653 --> 07:14.234
Good half.

07:14.254 --> 07:17.339
And you said you came here from England.

07:17.399 --> 07:20.243
You don't betray any accent.

07:20.263 --> 07:22.707
So where did you move to?

07:23.068 --> 07:23.508
New Jersey.

07:23.889 --> 07:24.330
New Jersey.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.733
And how long have you been to move from New England?

07:26.874 --> 07:28.596
Well, we only spent five years in New Jersey.

07:29.017 --> 07:31.120
And we moved to Rhode Island.

07:31.707 --> 07:32.548
Your family?

07:32.808 --> 07:33.770
The family, yep.

07:33.790 --> 07:35.492
My brother, sister, parents.

07:35.552 --> 07:36.393
And they're all here?

07:36.473 --> 07:36.934
They're all here.

07:36.954 --> 07:42.441
Well, my sister and brother are, my sister's in New York now, and my brother's in New Orleans.

07:42.621 --> 07:52.894
And you said your father made that, so he clearly has some very excellent manual skills.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.275
Oh, yeah.

07:54.356 --> 07:55.617
Is he an artist like this?

07:55.677 --> 08:00.263
No, he's worked in textiles all his life, and he retired about

08:00.513 --> 08:02.135
I don't know, eight years ago, something like that.

08:02.856 --> 08:09.844
He worked with textile machines, the big machines that produced enormous bolts of fabric.

08:10.645 --> 08:15.331
But he was the guy who kept the machines going and modified them and adjusted them and so on.

08:15.351 --> 08:16.473
So, always good with his hands.

08:17.193 --> 08:24.242
Worked on aircraft during the war for the RAF, which is where he met my mother.

08:24.475 --> 08:32.146
I think the important thing about my parents, there are many, but one of the important things about my parents is that their influence on me has been very clear.

08:34.108 --> 08:34.970
They're both makers.

08:35.691 --> 08:39.235
They never, never, they're not capable of sitting idle.

08:39.596 --> 08:40.758
It drives them both crazy.

08:41.198 --> 08:42.119
They're both makers of things.

08:42.180 --> 08:44.343
My mother sews needlepoint and all that sort of stuff.

08:44.363 --> 08:49.149
I mean, she used to make up clothes and one thing and another knitting and all that stuff.

08:49.169 --> 08:53.335
My father always made, you know, furniture and stuff like that that we happened to need

08:53.703 --> 08:57.528
And so I was always aware, growing up in England, of process.

08:58.530 --> 09:01.454
You know, that things didn't just fall out of the air.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.156
I mean, you know, there was a way things got done.

09:03.757 --> 09:06.000
And if you were going to do things, you did them certain ways.

09:06.661 --> 09:08.784
The old cliche, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing.

09:08.804 --> 09:09.946
But I saw firsthand.

09:10.727 --> 09:17.897
And I was always encouraged to draw and to make things and to sort of let my imagination run.

09:17.917 --> 09:22.343
And because you have such a fertile imagination, I'm wondering,

09:22.863 --> 09:25.146
what you wanted to be when you were a kid.

09:25.166 --> 09:25.727
Oh, fireman?

09:26.328 --> 09:27.529
Fireman for a long time.

09:27.910 --> 09:36.241
And I wanted to be a lifeguard, not the kind at the beach, but the kind in London with the tall hats that sit on the horses in front of, is it Kensington or St.

09:36.261 --> 09:37.222
James's Palace?

09:37.242 --> 09:37.823
I think it's St.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.105
James's.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.727
But they're one group of the soldiers.

09:42.569 --> 09:44.672
And I don't have a single lifeguard here.

09:45.573 --> 09:49.258
Oh, no, I didn't.

09:51.162 --> 09:52.844
Those are the hats of the lifeblocks.

09:52.904 --> 09:57.691
But only one, I guess.

09:58.011 --> 09:58.913
That's pretty heavy.

09:58.953 --> 09:59.794
Are these metal?

09:59.814 --> 10:01.316
Yeah, these are the old metal ones.

10:01.336 --> 10:02.177
From the Coronation.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.762
This is the 1938 Coronation Concession.

10:05.782 --> 10:06.583
Are they hand-painted?

10:06.944 --> 10:07.304
No.

10:09.607 --> 10:10.769
So, you wanted to be a fireman?

10:10.789 --> 10:12.411
You wanted to be a lifeguard?

10:12.431 --> 10:14.013
A lifeguard, yeah.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.338
And my grandfather was a kind of

10:17.943 --> 10:21.386
Not a full-fledged architect, but somewhere between architect and severe.

10:21.686 --> 10:28.012
And so he had a lot of portfolios of architectural drawings and all the tools in this room that we were never allowed to go in.

10:28.893 --> 10:31.155
And so I was always intrigued by that, too.

10:31.215 --> 10:36.640
So I think those kinds of influences stayed with me and shaped what I do.

10:37.721 --> 10:46.549
One of the sort of ironic, almost coincidental things is that growing up in England, in a very small house in the north of England,

10:47.288 --> 10:49.851
Whenever I could, I got out of it, because it was small.

10:50.592 --> 10:56.178
I mean, it was just like two rooms on the first floor and two and a half bedrooms on the second floor.

10:56.198 --> 10:56.579
That was it.

10:56.659 --> 10:57.540
I'm in a row house.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.825
So I spent a lot of time outside, and there were woods nearby and all that sort of stuff.

11:01.845 --> 11:04.568
So that's where my imagination was.

11:04.588 --> 11:05.969
I was always out there playing.

11:07.531 --> 11:15.220
And with the advent of television, I think we only had television for about maybe two years before we came.

11:16.415 --> 11:17.416
Maybe two, maybe one.

11:17.616 --> 11:17.877
I don't know.

11:17.897 --> 11:22.221
We came in 57, and I can't remember exactly when we got our television.

11:22.241 --> 11:26.847
I know we never had the refrigerator, but we did get the TV, and that's when I saw the Long Ranger and stuff like that.

11:26.867 --> 11:30.070
So I was always out there, you know, on horseback.

11:30.731 --> 11:42.003
At what point did you discover you had this talent to visualize things and see anything?

11:42.244 --> 11:44.346
Well, the easy answer is...

11:45.760 --> 11:49.924
I don't know that I... I guess I discovered I had something.

11:51.025 --> 11:59.111
Back in what would have been, I guess, third or fourth grade, I made a painting of a fire engine in a school in England, and the teachers made a fuss of it for the first time.

11:59.832 --> 12:02.995
And they put it on the wall, and I thought, well, I like the way this feels.

12:03.475 --> 12:10.661
And I think that was a... From that point on, drawing took on a power.

12:10.821 --> 12:15.025
I mean, I saw that this making pictures had a kind of power to it.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.704
I never stopped doing it for that reason.

12:18.465 --> 12:19.868
All through high school, I drew the Beatles.

12:20.088 --> 12:30.988
I would always come in just about every morning into the cafeteria where we all sat, waiting for classes to start, and show my latest drawings, which I would have done after homework the night before.

12:31.068 --> 12:37.039
I milked it for all it was worth, and then eventually realized that it could actually be a profession.

12:38.722 --> 12:40.084
I wanted to illustrate

12:41.633 --> 12:45.098
I think I wanted to illustrate because I really wanted to see my name on the cover of a book.

12:45.318 --> 12:48.343
I thought that would be really great and exciting.

12:48.563 --> 12:51.267
I don't know that I had anything to say particularly.

12:51.327 --> 12:53.871
This is roughly around when you were a teenager or in high school?

12:53.891 --> 12:59.399
No, this is now when I'm sort of working my way through architecture school at RISD.

12:59.419 --> 13:03.084
Okay, you should give me the educational background.

13:03.605 --> 13:03.805
Okay.

13:04.185 --> 13:05.047
Well, it's very simple.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.068
It's after high school.

13:06.329 --> 13:06.909
Which was here.

13:07.009 --> 13:11.556
Which was here and finishing up in Rhode Island, graduated in 64, and then to

13:11.840 --> 13:12.681
School of Design.

13:14.945 --> 13:18.790
Graduating in 1969 with a degree in architecture.

13:18.810 --> 13:20.052
Expecting to be an architect?

13:20.152 --> 13:23.417
No, I think I did when I started, or I thought I might be when I started.

13:23.457 --> 13:26.562
I certainly knew by my fourth year that I did not want to be an architect.

13:26.582 --> 13:31.269
It just seemed too cumbersome a process and too filled with compromise.

13:31.669 --> 13:35.295
Too many people get their fingers in it because there's too much money involved.

13:37.378 --> 13:41.644
So I wanted to do something else, and so I thought maybe freelance illustration

13:42.316 --> 13:46.361
Not that I'd ever considered illustration as a serious career.

13:46.441 --> 13:49.545
While a student, I didn't go into the illustration department.

13:49.966 --> 13:52.870
And I've never regretted that.

13:52.890 --> 14:06.788
I went into a department with a very rigorous, structured program that really taught me how to think and how to solve design problems in a very logical way, which I ultimately discovered I could apply to any number of situations.

14:06.868 --> 14:07.969
It didn't have to be buildings.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.793
Were you able to explore any freelance work?

14:10.973 --> 14:11.534
Yeah, I did.

14:11.875 --> 14:16.762
My first job was a menu cover for a local Chinese restaurant in Providence.

14:18.044 --> 14:20.769
There's one of them downstairs.

14:20.809 --> 14:24.495
And I have an ad from the newspaper that I did for the same restaurant.

14:24.535 --> 14:28.100
I did a lot of free stuff, because it would get printed.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.886
You know, a poster for Brown University, a choral trip to England, and stuff like that.

14:33.108 --> 14:36.353
Whatever would be printed, I would do for nothing.

14:36.940 --> 14:50.316
That's how it started, and I began to develop some story ideas, and I encouraged a couple of friends of mine to develop story ideas who I thought were much more competent than I to write stories, and they actually were.

14:51.297 --> 15:02.911
And I would design the books, you know, sort of create these little books and make all the drawings and stuff like that, and eventually put together enough stuff to take up to Boston, to Mifflin, and show around.

15:03.331 --> 15:04.973
And I got no really...

15:05.678 --> 15:08.441
Nobody wanted to publish any of it, but I sort of got encouragement.

15:09.602 --> 15:10.964
And that was the thing.

15:10.984 --> 15:14.347
This is in 71, roughly 71.

15:14.487 --> 15:15.689
I was doing 70, 71.

15:15.829 --> 15:23.177
And in 72, I had this idea of my own for a gargoyle beauty pageant set in the Middle Ages.

15:23.277 --> 15:24.919
Middle-aged, you know, France.

15:25.339 --> 15:30.685
Cathedral half under construction in the background and half built in the background.

15:30.705 --> 15:35.550
And then Walter Lorraine, who has been my editor ever since.

15:35.986 --> 15:43.975
L-O-R-A-I-N-E, said, basically, why don't you get rid of these gargoyles?

15:44.055 --> 15:46.618
I had gargoyles flying around, and this kind of magical.

15:46.718 --> 15:47.959
Just tell us about the cathedral.

15:48.039 --> 15:49.921
It looks like that's what you want to do in these drawings.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.707
And, well, he put his finger on it instantly.

15:54.727 --> 15:58.631
So I thought, I was disappointed at first, because I thought, these gargoyles are great.

15:58.651 --> 15:59.893
It's a real classic.

15:59.913 --> 16:03.917
But it was like a bad version of where the wild things are, in retrospect.

16:04.336 --> 16:17.510
So I started reading more stuff about Gothic construction, and began to visualize the drawings that I could make, and realized that I could tell a building story, primarily visually.

16:17.530 --> 16:26.079
And so I put together some sketches, just about the sequence of construction, from digging a hole in the ground to the finished building, all drawn in pencil.

16:26.740 --> 16:34.208
And I had no idea how big a book could be to be practical, in terms of actually printing it, or never mind selling it at a reasonable price.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.275
So these were all big things.

16:36.396 --> 16:43.642
But I took them up and I laid them out on the table for Walter and went through the story.

16:44.163 --> 16:46.845
And he said, okay, let's do it.

16:46.985 --> 16:48.807
That was in December of 1972.

16:49.948 --> 16:51.990
In January of 1973, I was in France.

16:52.570 --> 17:04.701
I went for a week and a half to Amiens, a cathedral I chose out of the book because it looked like the most cohesive and coherent cathedral.

17:05.187 --> 17:16.599
which is, I think, actually much more beautiful, grew over a much longer period of time, which is why the spires are so different, and the asymmetrical facade and whatnot.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.341
So the cathedral, pardon me, but in the book, is it more of like a generic cathedral?

17:19.442 --> 17:21.003
It's more of a generic cathedral.

17:21.023 --> 17:26.629
It was built in a relatively short period of time, I think about 30 years, which is really fast for those buildings.

17:26.649 --> 17:34.637
Most of the time, they ran out of money, and they had to stop for 20 years or something like that and parade the relics around the country and raise more funds, and then they could

17:34.955 --> 17:35.856
to build.

17:35.876 --> 17:49.533
So I wanted to sort of, if the people of the time could choose how they would like to build their building, I would assume that they would have liked to have gotten it done in their lifetime, you know, or at least a couple of generations, just to see it.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.356
So that's the way I decided to go.

17:52.396 --> 17:55.139
Did you have a reader in mind?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.522
Was it a kid's book in your view?

17:57.542 --> 17:58.383
No, it was a picture book.

17:59.144 --> 18:02.228
I mean, and then... I think the audience still is

18:02.883 --> 18:04.505
remains to be defined for you, doesn't it?

18:04.565 --> 18:06.428
Absolutely, and so I don't bother with it.

18:06.468 --> 18:08.531
I figure the books will find their audience.

18:08.991 --> 18:20.427
And if you don't speak down, you not only will attract an adult audience, you won't offend a younger audience.

18:20.447 --> 18:21.409
So I don't speak down.

18:21.429 --> 18:22.590
I mean, I just tell it straight.

18:23.391 --> 18:31.843
And every time I try and guess the sort of youngest age of the readers of my books, I'm always surprised, because there's always one younger than I would have guessed.

18:32.498 --> 18:34.721
So I don't try and guess anymore.

18:34.941 --> 18:50.502
I just tell... I mean, some of the books are... Some of the picture books, the real full-color picture books, the kind of zany stuff like Shortcut and Why the Chicken Crossed the Road, are more clearly for a younger audience.

18:50.542 --> 18:55.449
But the other stuff really is, I hope, an all-age kind of experience.

18:55.489 --> 18:58.573
And you get it at whatever level you are ready.

18:58.908 --> 19:03.272
My wife and I were agreeing on the ride down here, and I don't know how things work.

19:03.753 --> 19:18.486
That's a reference book that you see adults like myself using, because you've clearly paid a lot of attention to accuracy there, and to getting it right, and to making it a... Accuracy is important to me.

19:18.506 --> 19:19.287
It always has been.

19:19.668 --> 19:22.190
It's like, I mean, I think that's something else that comes from my parents.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.092
You know, if you're going to do it, do it right.

19:24.432 --> 19:27.615
And there's no reason not to be accurate.

19:28.895 --> 19:31.499
It doesn't take that much longer to do the research.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.924
And undoubtedly you're training as an architect.

19:34.944 --> 19:35.645
Makes me.

19:35.665 --> 19:36.987
The attention to detail.

19:37.848 --> 19:40.692
I can't just put a bush in front of it because I don't know what it looks like.

19:40.793 --> 19:41.974
I have to know what it looks like.

19:42.335 --> 19:50.587
Even if I have to end up putting a bush in front of it because I want that visually, but I've got to know what that part of the building or what that piece of equipment or what it looks like.

19:51.368 --> 19:53.912
I hate drawing stuff that I'm not prepared to draw.

19:53.952 --> 19:54.693
It's very hard.

19:55.154 --> 19:57.417
So can you characterize

19:57.785 --> 20:05.234
your body of work as a hoover, as a corpus of work that does more or less do a lot of similar things?

20:05.674 --> 20:07.196
Certainly the building books all do.

20:07.216 --> 20:23.276
I mean, the architecture books, including Underground and Mill and even Parts of the Amazing Brain, really are about understanding why things look the way they do, how they got to be that way.

20:23.776 --> 20:25.378
The way things work, you know,

20:25.696 --> 20:28.660
Why they look that way, how they get to be that way, and what they do.

20:29.901 --> 20:31.904
It's all investigation.

20:31.964 --> 20:37.871
It all stems from, I think, my own curiosity about how things work, why things work the way they do.

20:37.891 --> 20:40.013
And I've learned that that's what it is I like to do.

20:40.033 --> 20:40.834
I didn't know that.

20:41.655 --> 20:43.958
I couldn't have described that to you back in 1971.

20:44.459 --> 20:45.680
I wouldn't have had a clue.

20:46.321 --> 20:51.367
Even though I think it was definitely in place, because my architectural training was already there and at work.

20:53.630 --> 20:54.471
It's been a long time.

20:55.244 --> 21:05.955
process of sort of learning what it is that makes me happy, what gives me pleasure, and I've discovered that what gives me pleasure actually gives a lot of people pleasure.

21:07.397 --> 21:16.326
So I'm able to use my talents to, in a sense, share my enthusiasm for discovery.

21:16.366 --> 21:23.293
The response to Cathedral, I think, was quite... It's an amazing start.

21:23.645 --> 21:26.208
Tell me briefly.

21:26.228 --> 21:28.391
Well, I just, I remember people made a fuss.

21:28.772 --> 21:32.377
I mean, again, it's a long time ago now, and people made a fuss, which felt great.

21:32.397 --> 21:33.879
It was like the fire engine on the wall.

21:34.399 --> 21:36.182
You arrived full blown, basically.

21:36.242 --> 21:37.744
Well, that's what it appeared to be.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.586
I mean, that's certainly the way it looked at people.

21:39.606 --> 21:42.770
Here was this 9x12 black and white book that everybody was talking about.

21:45.674 --> 21:51.542
My clearest memory of the reaction to that book was being in a taxi with Walter in New York,

21:52.180 --> 22:06.157
I guess we're in an ALA, and we're going from one place to another, and I'd been signing books for two and a half hours on the floor or something like that, and he said, well, what are you going to do next?

22:06.177 --> 22:08.340
I'm like, oh, jeez, what am I going to do next?

22:08.780 --> 22:09.601
I'm enjoying this.

22:10.302 --> 22:10.943
What am I going to do next?

22:10.963 --> 22:11.984
Do you mean I have to do another?

22:12.024 --> 22:20.714
And I did City because the other, I thought to myself, okay, now why did I choose Cathedral?

22:20.734 --> 22:21.175
Because

22:21.577 --> 22:28.286
In studying the history of architecture at RISD, those buildings had really impressed me, and I just loved that whole thing.

22:28.306 --> 22:32.612
And I thought, what was another thing from those history of architecture classes that I really liked?

22:32.993 --> 22:35.637
And it was Roman planning, Roman planning and engineering.

22:35.737 --> 22:42.406
And I sort of admired what the Romans, at least in theory, were trying to do when they had laid out a city.

22:42.426 --> 22:45.410
And I thought, well, I could go back to that and do some more reading on that.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.533
And next thing I know, I'm back in...

22:48.104 --> 22:51.169
In fact, it was after the ALA, that summer, I'm back in France.

22:51.410 --> 22:55.076
Again, southern France, in Nîmes and Arles, looking at Roman ruins.

22:55.096 --> 22:58.563
And then I was also in Pompeii and Herculaneus.

22:58.583 --> 23:05.475
Let's kind of bring ourselves now to how things work and this new book.

23:05.595 --> 23:09.863
You indicated yesterday briefly on the phone that this is a work of passion.

23:09.883 --> 23:10.163
Yeah.

23:10.565 --> 23:14.810
Let's go from that book to this one.

23:14.970 --> 23:16.852
I'm more passionate about the subject matter.

23:16.872 --> 23:24.521
I'm passionate, obviously, about knowing how things work and being able to be clear about it.

23:25.162 --> 23:27.845
And that's true, definitely, with the way things work.

23:28.205 --> 23:36.715
But it's not a book that... I'm not emotional about the way things work, except how long it took to do it.

23:37.336 --> 23:38.597
I thought we would never finish it.

23:39.286 --> 23:47.034
I'm emotional about the subject matter, but I'm also concerned about the details in the subject matter of Romantics.

23:47.054 --> 23:51.419
And part of that is that Rome... I went to Italy as a fifth-year student in architecture.

23:51.439 --> 23:52.259
I spent a year there.

23:52.279 --> 23:57.905
It was my first year away from home since we left England at the age of 11.

23:57.925 --> 24:04.252
I was on my own for the first time in Italy, in Rome, with 24 other students from the School of Design.

24:04.672 --> 24:08.196
And for a school year, I knew that city to myself.

24:08.817 --> 24:11.120
So, of course, I feel passionate about it.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.984
I mean, that was the beginning of life in many ways.

24:14.004 --> 24:19.170
And I go back there, and it's interesting.

24:19.270 --> 24:20.712
I don't speak Italian very well at all.

24:20.752 --> 24:21.413
I never have.

24:22.134 --> 24:22.855
I can get by.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.939
I can't have a deep conversation with anybody to save my life.

24:27.441 --> 24:29.143
And yet, I always feel at home there.

24:29.163 --> 24:35.291
And I thought, what is it about this place that makes you feel at home when you can't actually talk to anybody?

24:35.311 --> 24:36.192
I mean, you're isolated.

24:36.982 --> 24:46.834
And as an isolated individual who can then somehow still feel comfortable and still feel at home, something about this physical place must be contributing to that sensation.

24:46.854 --> 24:50.719
And what it is, I think, is that it is truly an eternal city.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.602
There is no real line between the past and the present.

24:53.622 --> 24:54.824
They mix.

24:54.844 --> 24:59.550
It's an amazing city for recycling itself.

24:59.570 --> 25:02.293
And it's continued to recycle itself for over 2,000 years.

25:02.894 --> 25:04.035
So you get these...

25:04.235 --> 25:06.839
Phenomenal juxtapositions of past and present.

25:06.859 --> 25:11.125
You know, the scooter leaning up against a first century Doric column.

25:11.746 --> 25:13.368
And it seems perfectly appropriate.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.310
It's absolutely appropriate.

25:14.330 --> 25:14.971
It's all life.

25:15.792 --> 25:26.327
And the way people in the sort of, let's say the Renaissance, or shortly after the Renaissance, used pieces of Roman architecture to decorate, to embellish their homes that they were building.

25:26.678 --> 25:34.446
So you get Roman carvings and bits of sculpture stuck in the walls of a 16th century building.

25:35.247 --> 25:36.609
There's a sense of continuity.

25:36.829 --> 25:55.369
That is probably the single most powerful force for me in Rome, and the single most reassuring, because as life gets crazier, to go to a place where you have that sense of continuity, a sense of survival, a sense of people being able to make it through horrible times,

25:55.805 --> 25:57.628
And somehow they get by, they go on.

25:57.668 --> 25:59.130
I find really great.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.275
It sort of fills you with some hope.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.920
And that's one of the things Rome does.

26:06.321 --> 26:10.947
Visually, every time you turn a corner in Rome, you don't know what to expect.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.752
That's another thing I find extremely exciting about the city.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.354
You just don't know what's around the corner.

26:15.714 --> 26:18.859
And it could be a bit of a Roman temple front, again, stuck in another wall.

26:18.919 --> 26:25.609
It could be that the street is dug up and all the cobbles are piled up in these kind of pyramid shapes against the wall while the guys are trying to fix water pipes

26:26.180 --> 26:34.592
And you see the structure of the road, and you know that the road surface is 10 feet higher than the road surface was in running times.

26:35.754 --> 26:43.004
And in doing this, did you do much of it from your memory of it, or did you find that you had to go back?

26:43.024 --> 26:43.765
Oh, no, I went back.

26:43.825 --> 26:44.987
I spent two summers there.

26:45.628 --> 26:47.771
Not last summer, but the two summers before I spent there.

26:47.791 --> 26:52.778
And I went back again in the spring of this year to make one more four-day kind of foray

26:53.129 --> 26:56.152
Once I determined the route, I was going to have the pigeon fly.

26:56.273 --> 27:02.600
I went back and traveled the route and looked very carefully to make sure I had the right angles and so on and so forth.

27:02.620 --> 27:09.988
My imagination determines the overall approach to the subject matter, and it also determines what the angles are from which I show these things.

27:10.829 --> 27:18.078
From that point on, I try to make sure I have the information necessary to draw this stuff as accurately as possible so you really can feel that you're up there.

27:18.658 --> 27:20.000
Well, I feel that's another thing.

27:20.020 --> 27:20.200
I mean,

27:20.669 --> 27:23.452
that many of us can fly and look at the policy from up here.

27:23.472 --> 27:26.616
So you really do have to figure things out.

27:26.636 --> 27:27.957
Yeah, and it's a combination.

27:27.977 --> 27:44.056
I tell the students at RISD when I'm teaching not to become too dependent on photographs, because if you become dependent on photographs, you're forced to put the viewer in always new real places, on solid ground.

27:44.877 --> 27:48.882
And that's not necessarily where you always want to be, to tell the most exciting story.

27:48.902 --> 27:50.203
You've got to be able to develop

27:52.006 --> 27:54.829
your ability with perspective.

27:54.929 --> 27:58.172
If you get a handle on perspective, you can really be anywhere.

27:58.572 --> 28:01.235
And you've got to develop your imagination to know where to be.

28:01.475 --> 28:02.996
You don't want it to be a documentary.

28:03.156 --> 28:03.857
No, not at all.

28:03.877 --> 28:06.079
There has to be that element of whimsy and imagination.

28:06.099 --> 28:07.340
That's right, that's right.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.763
Which is highlighted by the trail and the pigeon.

28:09.823 --> 28:11.304
I want to get the blue red line.

28:11.404 --> 28:12.425
Yeah, exactly.

28:12.805 --> 28:20.933
That gives me a chance to embellish things, to draw your attention to architectural details in a very playful way, to do a little slapstick,

28:21.655 --> 28:26.319
to soften it up so you're not buying a portfolio of pseudo-Piranesi drawings of Rome.

28:26.960 --> 28:32.065
It's another kind of experience, and hopefully sort of catch onto that fairly quickly.

28:32.085 --> 28:35.748
Do you get many people saying, gee, David, why don't you do these in color?

28:37.029 --> 28:38.771
Well, this book went back and forth.

28:38.931 --> 28:45.137
There's a sketch on the wall there that you can see looking up at the sky, just to the end to the left.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.098
There's a black and white version of that filling in the book.

28:47.899 --> 28:49.561
And I went back and forth.

28:49.581 --> 28:51.122
I was torn about that because

28:51.507 --> 28:54.591
It is a city where the colors are really important to me.

28:57.015 --> 29:01.661
The way the colors on the buildings change, especially in the evening as the sun is setting, you don't forget it.

29:03.023 --> 29:08.150
Part of that may have to do with the wine, but you really don't forget the way these buildings, they glow at night.

29:08.170 --> 29:08.851
It's amazing.

29:10.433 --> 29:13.398
But I decided, no, this is going to be a black and white book.

29:13.418 --> 29:20.147
This is intentionally going to remind people, in a sense, of the architecture books of 25 years ago, but it's also

29:20.667 --> 29:26.917
Because of its playfulness, it's more like shortcut and more whimsical like the later books.

29:26.937 --> 29:45.506
So it is a kind of bringing together both ends of this 25-year period around a subject that I'm sure was really influential and critical in kind of getting me started in this sort of desire to use my imagination in some creative way.

29:45.926 --> 29:49.071
Now, you see, I'll be pointing out my piece.

29:50.738 --> 29:58.691
You might, a person will pick this book up in a bookstore and they'll see very little text is at a decided minimum.

29:58.711 --> 30:06.144
But then, at the end, you really do, this becomes, text becomes essential.

30:06.224 --> 30:08.988
An essential part of the book.

30:09.028 --> 30:10.671
And maybe you could address yourself too.

30:11.022 --> 30:15.207
the marriage of text with art, and your feelings as well.

30:15.327 --> 30:40.557
Well, that's always been one of the most exciting things to me, and one of the hardest things about making these books is finding that link, is finding the appropriate link between words and pictures, and not being redundant, not repeating yourself, being competent enough in the visuals to know when they are communicating, when they are telling the story you want to tell, and when they really need the help of a more conventional text line.

30:40.958 --> 30:46.246
Or when it's more efficient to say something in 15 words than it is to make a drawing of it.

30:46.266 --> 30:47.688
And you can still make the same point.

30:47.708 --> 30:52.775
So it's like having two different vocabularies to work with at the same time.

30:53.536 --> 31:05.894
And the process of making these books for me is choosing from each vocabulary, weaving them together in order to most effectively communicate whatever it is you're trying to say on each page.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.877
So you really see it then as

31:09.359 --> 31:12.262
combining two skills of your own.

31:12.582 --> 31:28.957
I did an interview with Anita Sylvie of your company, and Anita says today, for instance, what they like or what they look for in emerging talent is have a writer produce a story, and they'll find the artist.

31:29.397 --> 31:34.041
They don't even want the writer to ever have met the artist.

31:34.061 --> 31:34.762
That's very true.

31:34.822 --> 31:38.185
And I'm wondering what your reaction to that kind of a project is.

31:40.291 --> 31:41.892
Could you do that?

31:42.073 --> 31:42.493
Oh, yeah.

31:42.933 --> 31:49.439
If somebody wrote a story that I really thought was terrific, I did it once with a story by a guy named David Porter who worked with at RISD.

31:50.180 --> 31:54.904
It's not the best way to work, and I don't think it produces the best work.

31:54.924 --> 31:55.805
I really don't.

31:55.905 --> 32:00.729
Walter will only work with people who do both write and illustrate.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.771
I think it's really important.

32:03.992 --> 32:08.256
You break these things down into their little components, and you

32:09.147 --> 32:19.958
You can, if you're really a good editor, I suppose, or lucky, manage to create a magic sort of connection.

32:20.499 --> 32:31.490
But the opportunity that the individual has who is encouraged to work on both paths at the same time to create something that is much more cohesive is that much greater, I think.

32:31.510 --> 32:35.615
I don't write the book first and then illustrate it, and I don't illustrate it and then write it.

32:35.695 --> 32:38.918
I mean, the writing and the pictures develop simultaneously.

32:39.083 --> 32:53.801
I'll work on sketches up here, and I'll get frustrated with it, or I'll lose my way, and I'll go down to the computer, and I'll put the sketches there, and I'll start to just write some rough stuff, and I'll begin to see some kind of order from the words, perhaps, that comes right back up here.

32:54.322 --> 32:58.667
It allows me to organize the pictures and to make little diagrams of the way I think the book is going to go.

32:58.707 --> 33:06.217
Then I can go back downstairs and write some more, but it's very much one part of the process feeds the other.

33:07.678 --> 33:08.179
I'm not

33:12.462 --> 33:15.587
I wouldn't want to be limited to one or the other.

33:17.791 --> 33:18.953
Writing for me has always been hard.

33:18.973 --> 33:21.517
It's the hardest part of the process, no question about it.

33:21.537 --> 33:26.705
Which is why I think I probably rely on the visuals to tell so much of the story.

33:27.186 --> 33:30.331
But I enjoy the writing part of it more now than I used to.

33:30.351 --> 33:31.994
I used to put it off as long as possible.

33:32.034 --> 33:38.605
I would write in a very sort of sketchy, outlined way for the early Cathedral City Pyramid books.

33:39.125 --> 33:46.714
And then I would always wait until the day after Christmas and I would sit down at the typewriter and for five days I would write, in five days I would write the story.

33:47.716 --> 33:53.223
And by this point I had a layout of what I thought was going to be on each page anyway.

33:53.623 --> 33:58.429
So I'd have a draft by about the 29th of December, something like that, 30th.

33:58.449 --> 34:02.414
And then I could go back and forth and cut it up and stuff like that.

34:03.075 --> 34:08.862
But now I tend to write much more freely, mixing that part of the process with the

34:09.466 --> 34:17.138
My sense also is that you probably wouldn't be particularly pleased to have somebody else interpret what your pictures are.

34:18.680 --> 34:21.464
No, because why explain the picture?

34:21.504 --> 34:24.589
I mean, I don't use the picture as decorative in any way.

34:24.629 --> 34:26.912
The picture has a job to do.

34:27.593 --> 34:30.698
It has a job to do that is as important as the paragraph.

34:31.139 --> 34:34.123
It has its part of the story to tell.

34:36.415 --> 34:59.315
If you're going to take that tack of separating visual artists from writers, then you have to be really confident in the ability of those people to reach their own unique strengths, but on independent tracks.

34:59.335 --> 35:05.140
If that can happen, then maybe something interesting goes on between the two things.

35:05.980 --> 35:13.910
If a writer was in any way overwhelmed by the visual stuff and felt somewhat intimidated by it, what kind of a reaction would that create?

35:14.050 --> 35:16.513
Maybe antagonism, who knows?

35:18.656 --> 35:22.400
It's a really careful match that you have to make there.

35:22.601 --> 35:30.891
It can be done, it has been done, but I am not really interested in doing books that way.

35:31.799 --> 35:34.001
I wouldn't want to give up that part of the process.

35:34.021 --> 35:35.082
That's why I'm not an architect.

35:35.162 --> 35:36.624
I don't want to compromise in that way.

35:36.984 --> 35:40.328
Now, the medium here is, I think, is that right?

35:40.348 --> 35:42.049
It's this pen.

35:42.129 --> 35:45.873
It's this pen right here.

35:45.893 --> 35:49.357
And are you equally comfortable with color?

35:49.597 --> 35:49.917
Yeah.

35:49.937 --> 35:52.440
Is this your medium of preference?

35:52.580 --> 35:53.941
Well, it depends on the book.

35:54.822 --> 35:57.185
Black and white would not have been appropriate for the way things work.

35:57.285 --> 36:00.388
It needed color, in part, to liven it up.

36:00.740 --> 36:04.766
to soften it, because it's such a mass of information.

36:04.826 --> 36:08.192
The black and white works here because it's really about details.

36:08.252 --> 36:12.559
A lot of it is about details and shape and basic light and dark.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.844
It's not about the color of the stucco or that sort of thing.

36:15.864 --> 36:20.251
That's another wonderful layer of information, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.

36:20.271 --> 36:25.279
This was really about the details that you run into as you wander through the streets of Rome.

36:25.883 --> 36:34.296
You said when you did Cathedral, you really didn't have a sense of scale, and really you weren't thinking of the printed page at that particular point.

36:34.316 --> 36:50.362
I assume now, as you've progressed, that you're constantly thinking of these pictures in terms of how they're going to appear in scale, whether it's going to be on the right page or on the left page, and whether you're going to have a go through the fold or whatever.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.203
That's what I've learned.

36:51.223 --> 36:53.106
I mean, that's been the learning process.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.382
You know, how do you make these pages work?

36:55.442 --> 36:58.005
When do you let a drawing bleed off the pages?

36:59.627 --> 37:02.811
When do you use small drawings, large drawings?

37:02.971 --> 37:04.834
When do you change points of view and that kind of stuff?

37:04.854 --> 37:07.957
I mean, I've been sort of developing that skill all along.

37:08.378 --> 37:16.127
But until fairly close to the end of the book, this book was, these books, these drawings all bled all the way around.

37:16.407 --> 37:18.570
I had a friend over, an illustrator named Jan Atkins.

37:19.158 --> 37:26.249
who came visiting one day, and he looked at the drawings, and he said, I think you should put borders around these drawings, because I think they will look larger with borders.

37:26.670 --> 37:31.097
And I had always thought, no, if they bleed off the page, they look larger.

37:31.177 --> 37:32.379
They look like they're still going.

37:32.539 --> 37:32.739
Right.

37:32.779 --> 37:37.847
Well, there's a distinction that I have decided, and it may be a completely artificial distinction, but I think the distinction is this.

37:38.448 --> 37:44.718
With borders, with these double borders, there's a kind of formality to it, and it does give, it makes them look grander.

37:44.879 --> 37:45.840
It's like a gallery, isn't it?

37:45.972 --> 37:46.713
Yeah, exactly.

37:46.733 --> 37:47.254
Like a frame.

37:47.374 --> 37:55.826
But when they bleed off the pages, they don't necessarily look bigger, it's just that they draw you in in a different way, because in a sense they kind of surround you more with the space.

37:55.846 --> 38:06.321
So there's subtle differences, but I like the fact that this has a formality to it now, because it plays off the line of the pigeon much more effectively.

38:06.601 --> 38:13.110
I mean, it's as if a kid went through this fine art book with a crayon,

38:13.715 --> 38:17.560
and said, let's just draw a line here, and let's squiggle here, and so on.

38:17.580 --> 38:37.846
I mean, there's a kind of an intentional sort of almost sacrilege at work here, which I hope, you know, sort of emphasizes the kind of playfulness of my approach to the subject without diminishing my affection for the subject.

38:39.088 --> 38:40.650
What have you got planned?

38:41.913 --> 38:45.497
Well, we have two, I mean, two, I think they're kind of easy projects in a way.

38:45.517 --> 39:00.736
One is the building's book, building book's book about process, which I think we'll try and do for the 25th anniversary of Cathedral, whether it relates specifically to Cathedral, I'm not sure yet.

39:01.457 --> 39:11.008
And the second thing is a 10th anniversary edition of The Way Things Work, which corrections, and now there are some corrections, but more importantly, a new section on the computers.

39:11.528 --> 39:12.609
for the end of it.

39:12.809 --> 39:16.793
So there will be, for the end of next year.

39:16.813 --> 39:22.218
Yeah, there are half a dozen things that are just not clear or are incorrect.

39:22.238 --> 39:23.399
And we'll fix those.

39:23.819 --> 39:24.940
How do you find these?

39:24.980 --> 39:25.741
Oh, you get letters.

39:27.022 --> 39:28.543
You get letters.

39:28.563 --> 39:34.489
There's no shortage of experts out there who know their area.

39:34.909 --> 39:38.252
And if you step into their area and don't get it right, they're going to tell you, which is great.

39:39.413 --> 39:41.535
The fact that they bother to tell you

39:42.258 --> 39:45.949
suggests a kind of respect for your efforts.

39:47.393 --> 39:48.717
Can you give me an example?

39:48.737 --> 39:49.218
Do you mind?

39:49.900 --> 39:53.651
Something that you might have... I don't know.

39:53.671 --> 39:54.293
Clarification?

39:54.393 --> 39:55.356
I really can't remember.

39:55.910 --> 39:57.651
They're not big things.

39:57.812 --> 39:58.572
But you want them right.

39:58.712 --> 40:00.294
You want it right.

40:00.354 --> 40:05.418
They're not major misinterpretations, but maybe it's the way something turns.

40:05.478 --> 40:07.860
It's not like putting a heart on the left side or the right side.

40:08.160 --> 40:13.365
Maybe an arrow goes the wrong way on the gyroscope or something like that.

40:13.385 --> 40:14.005
I don't remember.

40:14.686 --> 40:21.632
I've actually looked at that book more critically lately, thinking to myself, even I don't know quite how to read this arrow.

40:22.352 --> 40:23.393
What did I mean by this?

40:24.014 --> 40:25.495
So this is a chance to

40:25.846 --> 40:27.468
clear up some of those things.

40:27.889 --> 40:33.556
But then, as I say, to create a new section at the end that is devoted just to digital.

40:33.576 --> 40:42.908
Now, it's a matter of a marketplace, but where you are marketed as a children's book artist, illustrator.

40:43.909 --> 40:49.997
But you indicated earlier, you don't see these books as exclusively defined.

40:50.973 --> 40:55.198
But do you hear from readers of every age group?

40:55.258 --> 40:56.038
Oh, yeah.

40:56.279 --> 40:59.542
A lot of kids' letters, and a fair number of adults.

41:01.124 --> 41:07.651
I'm bad at writing back, but I don't have time.

41:07.671 --> 41:11.575
So I do know that there's a broad range out there, because they do respond.

41:11.595 --> 41:16.120
I got a wonderful letter the other day from a fellow in Virginia about unbuilding.

41:16.893 --> 41:26.741
this two-page description of why he loves unbuilding and how he sees the art being used, different kinds of art, within the context of the book.

41:27.642 --> 41:46.798
I mean, it's an incredibly detailed letter that took some real... I mean, if I was trying to describe to somebody to analyze what was going on in unbuilding, which I would probably never do, I would just as soon read this letter to them because it's a really terrific analysis.

41:47.133 --> 41:50.798
of the structure of Unbuilding and of the nature of the different drawings.

41:50.818 --> 41:57.326
Now, you've certainly got a whole other, I mean, 25, 34 years more.

41:58.427 --> 42:00.650
Do you see where it's going?

42:02.192 --> 42:14.828
I don't know where it's going specifically, except that I do know I will continue to do books about the kind, continue to do books, first of all, and then continue to do books about the kinds of things that intrigue

42:15.044 --> 42:18.129
In some cases, it's just the joy of playing with the structure of the book.

42:18.550 --> 42:22.937
That's where a book like Shortcut or Why the Chicken Cross the Red are black and white.

42:24.340 --> 42:29.709
But it's just playing with the object and seeing what you can do with it, having people use it in a slightly different way.

42:29.729 --> 42:35.619
What's your reaction to, I mean, I love the fact that you use black and white, by the way, in terms of photography.

42:36.961 --> 42:40.427
I'm so partial to black and white photography, even black and white cinema.

42:40.913 --> 42:52.872
But, you know, we have a parallel development here with interactive stuff and computers, and we're talking now about where you see yourself 23 years from now, it'll be 2020, it'll be a year.

42:53.473 --> 42:57.620
And, you know, do you have any anxiety about where the book is going?

42:58.782 --> 43:00.325
I really don't.

43:00.385 --> 43:01.727
I don't have any anxiety at all.

43:01.807 --> 43:06.735
I think there will always be a, there may be less books produced.

43:07.829 --> 43:09.631
Which may not be such a bad thing.

43:09.651 --> 43:10.932
Which may not be such a bad thing.

43:12.454 --> 43:18.020
But I think that books, I mean, there are things you can do in books that you can't do in other mediums.

43:18.040 --> 43:26.130
And there's an experience, a kind of personal experience with a book that is not the same as turning on a computer or sitting at the screen.

43:26.170 --> 43:31.936
Does it concern you where, you know, you see this in the so-called interactive fiction?

43:31.956 --> 43:37.262
And I'm wondering now, you know, your books are yours, and those pictures,

43:38.103 --> 43:41.687
Would it bother you if this were published?

43:42.187 --> 43:42.908
In pieces?

43:43.609 --> 43:52.018
Not only in pieces, but in fragments that allow other people to go in and tamper with what you've done, have their own interpretation.

43:52.158 --> 43:55.741
It wouldn't bother me if that was something that happened down the line.

43:56.202 --> 43:56.442
Right.

43:56.542 --> 44:06.793
I think that people want, and Walter and I have talked about this a lot, I mean, I think people want to hear what somebody has to say about something.

44:07.195 --> 44:11.680
I don't think they always want just a collection of pieces that they can sort of mess around with themselves.

44:12.301 --> 44:29.260
I mean, reading about how somebody feels about something, or the way somebody sees technology and stuff like that, I mean, that's why we read books, is to get particular points of view, particular perspectives.

44:29.741 --> 44:30.001
Right.

44:30.041 --> 44:31.603
I think that's always going to be true.

44:31.723 --> 44:32.764
I like that.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.261
I don't think that will ever go away.

44:36.281 --> 44:43.030
I think it's always nice to be able to sort of read what somebody you admire or whose opinions you respect has to say about something.

44:43.451 --> 44:45.373
And then if you're going to play with it later on, fine.

44:45.634 --> 44:53.744
But I don't think people are going to want to give up that, or will give up the sort of enjoyment of finding out what somebody wants.

44:53.764 --> 45:00.473
I'll call your publisher and I'll try to get more precise figures from them, and I certainly want to attribute these to you because you might feel a little more

45:01.178 --> 45:04.541
But can you give me an idea of how your books do in the marketplace?

45:04.561 --> 45:07.424
I mean, they are exceedingly popular.

45:07.444 --> 45:08.225
Yeah, they seem to be okay.

45:08.325 --> 45:09.106
I don't know.

45:09.126 --> 45:11.488
What's the first printing of this, for instance?

45:11.528 --> 45:12.489
Oh, Romantics?

45:12.930 --> 45:14.972
I am not sure.

45:15.152 --> 45:15.693
We talked.

45:16.914 --> 45:18.375
It's either 30 or 50,000.

45:18.555 --> 45:20.057
I don't know.

45:20.738 --> 45:24.361
And the way things work is... Oh, that's done.

45:24.421 --> 45:25.582
That's done.

45:26.023 --> 45:29.306
Between two and three minutes.

45:29.326 --> 45:30.207
That's done for a while.

45:32.414 --> 45:35.037
That's amazing, isn't it?

45:35.057 --> 45:35.237
Yeah.

45:35.377 --> 45:36.738
Mostly in hardcover?

45:36.798 --> 45:37.399
Was there a privilege there?

45:37.419 --> 45:38.460
There's no paperback in the shape.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.182
It's all hardcover.

45:40.202 --> 45:41.423
Around the world.

45:41.443 --> 45:41.783
That's wonderful.

45:41.803 --> 45:41.903
Yeah.

45:41.964 --> 45:44.046
How many languages?

45:44.066 --> 45:45.167
A dozen.

45:45.427 --> 45:46.648
A dozen or so.

45:46.688 --> 45:48.750
Two or three million.

45:48.790 --> 45:48.910
Yeah.

45:48.930 --> 45:49.611
Two or three million.

45:49.631 --> 45:51.933
I think maybe two million in this country.

45:53.335 --> 45:54.456
But, no, it's done well.

45:54.816 --> 45:55.697
That's the franchise.

45:56.318 --> 45:56.658
Yeah.

45:57.319 --> 45:58.300
Yeah.

45:58.420 --> 46:01.543
And you briefly, and I guess we can wrap up pretty soon,

46:02.249 --> 46:04.271
You mentioned your family just biographically.

46:04.291 --> 46:07.514
You mentioned you have a... Yeah, well, I remarried in January.

46:08.054 --> 46:10.457
And in fact, the book is dedicated to Ruthie.

46:10.477 --> 46:19.605
That's the... I mean, the little bit of love story that sort of runs through this thing, I think, reflects my own life absolutely now.

46:20.226 --> 46:23.248
What's great is that I can put it in a place that was such a part of my life.

46:24.329 --> 46:26.852
You know.

46:26.892 --> 46:27.973
In 1968, 69.

46:28.033 --> 46:28.694
Yeah, new baby.

46:28.834 --> 46:29.815
And the baby's name is?

46:29.855 --> 46:30.315
Julia.

46:30.886 --> 46:32.588
She's three months old.

46:32.768 --> 46:33.709
She's three months old.

46:33.889 --> 46:37.913
And your wife's name is great.

46:37.933 --> 46:43.278
And I have two older daughters, a 16-year-old and a 23-year-old.

46:43.398 --> 46:45.140
And they're all great with Julia.

46:46.641 --> 46:47.642
Are you a kid at heart?

46:48.123 --> 46:48.403
Yeah.

46:52.347 --> 46:55.330
Connie, did you have anything you wanted to ask David?

46:55.610 --> 46:59.914
I don't have the finished book, but I wonder if you'd write something.

47:01.396 --> 47:24.615
We're going to Italy, as it happens quite... This is Connie, and I'm... I'm just going to briefly take a few minutes while we're going.

47:24.635 --> 47:26.037
I forgot to bring my family together.

47:27.282 --> 47:31.807
At some point, would you object if I called you and made an appointment to come down and shoot some pictures?

47:31.827 --> 47:31.987
No.

47:32.147 --> 47:32.327
No.

47:32.748 --> 47:35.030
But I think we're ready to get some color here, don't you think?

47:35.050 --> 47:35.170
No.

47:43.679 --> 47:45.260
Do you do any photography, by the way?

47:46.121 --> 47:47.442
I shoot all the research stuff.

47:47.703 --> 47:48.143
They do.

47:48.363 --> 47:51.046
Oh, yeah.

47:51.667 --> 47:52.067
Slides.

47:52.247 --> 47:53.368
Actually, slides and prints.

47:53.869 --> 47:55.150
Mostly prints last night.

47:55.170 --> 47:56.952
I've been shooting more prints than anything else.

47:58.147 --> 48:02.353
This apparently is an historic building, and it has a date on it.

48:02.373 --> 48:03.114
Right, right.

48:03.134 --> 48:04.316
What's the history of the building?

48:04.376 --> 48:08.061
It was a shop when it was first built, and it's been all kinds of things.

48:08.101 --> 48:09.783
It was the Sons of Italy Hall up here.

48:09.803 --> 48:10.624
There was a pool table.

48:11.185 --> 48:16.993
There was cement on the floor when I bought the building, a layer of cement, chicken wine.

48:17.013 --> 48:20.118
It took us a Labor Day, an entire Labor Day to get rid of it.

48:20.138 --> 48:22.601
You mentioned that your wife designs jewelry, is that right?

48:22.621 --> 48:23.583
Yes, she's making jewelry.

48:23.603 --> 48:27.428
She's actually a graduate of the School of Design also.

48:28.167 --> 48:32.612
She's now making jewelry.

48:32.632 --> 48:33.393
Which is going well.

48:33.633 --> 48:36.336
She just surprised herself.

48:36.356 --> 48:37.558
She's also a maker of things.

48:38.319 --> 48:39.500
And she studied illustration.

48:39.520 --> 48:44.145
She studied journalism at KU and then came to RISD to study illustration.

48:44.726 --> 48:46.788
But she's happiest when she's making things.

48:47.749 --> 48:49.551
What is that statue over there?

48:49.571 --> 48:50.793
Is that an Indian?

48:50.833 --> 48:52.715
Yeah, he's sort of online from the library.

48:53.476 --> 48:57.060
Yeah, there are a couple of these plaster castings around it.

48:57.513 --> 49:00.138
The library had no room for it, so I said I'd give them a home.

49:03.405 --> 49:07.693
I'm all set.

49:09.256 --> 49:13.665
I know you have to... I'm sorry.

49:15.350 --> 49:17.954
What's that?

49:17.974 --> 49:18.575
About the maps.

49:18.595 --> 49:23.482
The idea of doing a book about maps where you sort of tell a story by reading maps.

49:23.502 --> 49:35.740
I mean, there needn't be any text actually beyond the maps themselves, and you would just turn the pages from map to map, and depending on what the map told you and how you used your imagination with the map, you would figure out where the story was from.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.823
Of course, what is the whole essence of cartography?

49:37.843 --> 49:39.065
It's to get you from here to there.

49:39.145 --> 49:39.906
That's right.

49:40.190 --> 49:42.093
Yeah, and you can do that in a very graphic way.

49:42.113 --> 49:43.215
Oh, it's fascinating, yeah.

49:43.235 --> 49:43.736
They're fascinating.

49:43.756 --> 49:47.803
I mean, maps are just so intriguing because they force you to use your imagination to make that leap.

49:47.823 --> 49:50.547
Have you ever seen that Abrams book, The Mapping of America?

49:51.309 --> 49:53.612
You should really try and take a look at it.

49:54.774 --> 49:56.337
Mysteries of Earth.

49:57.018 --> 49:58.641
That's great.

49:59.342 --> 50:01.185
You mentioned, you said that you

50:01.233 --> 50:05.087
When you talk about exhibitions, you don't like to choke.

50:05.188 --> 50:08.660
I don't frame this up and put it up like it's fine art.

50:08.861 --> 50:09.764
It's really processed.

50:09.784 --> 50:13.217
They're working drawings.
