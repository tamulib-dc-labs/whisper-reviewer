Yeah, some of what I've written has been taken quite seriously by the critics.

00:07.589 --> 00:11.919
And I feel I'm able to sort of bisect two worlds, really.

00:11.939 --> 00:17.432
I mean, you know, people inclined to take me reasonably seriously.

00:17.885 --> 00:43.183
You know the thing is you see I mean I enjoy writing, and it seems to me a lot of thriller writers don't actually like writing. They don't like sort of you know the business of creating um a novel. They enjoy the research rather than the actual uh construction of the book, but I just I mean I enjoy writing a piece of prose and therefore I mean I hope that comes through you know um but I never lose sight of the fact that you know

00:43.552 --> 00:46.619
Some guys paid $20 to buy the book and read it.

00:47.622 --> 00:48.303
You know what, Phillip?

00:48.323 --> 00:51.812
Somebody's desperately trying to get me here, and I am expecting a poor girl.

00:51.832 --> 00:54.739
So I think I've got plenty of stuff right here, so I'm going to break it off.

00:54.819 --> 00:55.801
I think I'm going to take this off.

00:55.821 --> 00:56.042
All right.

00:56.062 --> 00:57.184
Well, if you find your day, do call back.

00:57.204 --> 00:57.305
Okay.

00:57.325 --> 00:57.906
Thanks a lot.

00:57.926 --> 00:58.868
It was good speaking to you.

00:58.888 --> 00:59.049
Good.

00:59.089 --> 00:59.350
Bye-bye.

00:59.630 --> 00:59.991
Bye-bye.
