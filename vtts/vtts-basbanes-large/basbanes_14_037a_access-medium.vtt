WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:08.734
So we're talking with Ken Carpenter at home, and you're just telling me that you're trying to do your own book on libraries.

00:09.295 --> 00:29.295
Well, we're just getting underway what we call a history of libraries in America, and the headquarters are at the center for the book at L.C., and letters are going out this week for, you know, to...

00:29.900 --> 00:35.087
some people to serve on an executive committee and an advisory board.

00:35.467 --> 00:42.536
And we're hoping for a three-volume work.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.581
I'm going to be doing the part of 1893.

00:46.621 --> 00:52.970
And Wayne Wiegand at the University of Wisconsin... His name has already been given to me, the second one now.

00:52.990 --> 00:59.518
...is going to do the 20th Century...

01:00.376 --> 01:10.837
And then we hope to have another volume that covers topics that we couldn't cover in our more chronological approach.

01:10.857 --> 01:21.338
So while we're planning a very scholarly kind of book, we're hoping then afterwards to produce a

01:21.773 --> 01:26.058
a history of libraries that obviously is going to be very different from yours.

01:26.138 --> 01:33.206
Mine is not a history, and I'm not even, just as General Madness was not a history of book collecting.

01:33.286 --> 01:39.533
It was very selective, it was anecdotal, it was a narrative, and I'm picking my spots.

01:39.793 --> 01:42.376
Yes, that's right.

01:42.396 --> 01:47.121
And so what I'm hoping is that yours will just whet the appetite for art.

01:47.141 --> 01:47.882
It should.

01:48.048 --> 01:56.789
And all I can say with Gentle Madness is that it did create a market in the minds of the publishers for books that they never would have touched.

01:56.909 --> 02:02.142
And I can name the four or five books that came after mine, and I'm happy to see it, you know, Alberto Mangual's.

02:02.611 --> 02:07.016
History of Reading, which I enjoyed enormously, and a few other books.

02:07.256 --> 02:08.617
Really, that's wonderful.

02:08.858 --> 02:10.439
That's wonderful.

02:10.459 --> 02:19.709
I did demonstrate to these blockheads in New York that people who love books might want to buy a book about books in libraries.

02:19.729 --> 02:27.598
It shouldn't be too difficult a concept to grasp.

02:27.618 --> 02:28.979
That's right.

02:29.059 --> 02:31.842
In terms of history, are you talking in terms of what

02:32.918 --> 02:38.143
how they came into being philosophically?

02:38.203 --> 02:42.267
Well, we're focusing on American libraries.

02:42.287 --> 02:59.304
But, you know, you have to go back to Benjamin Franklin and the start of the library company in Philadelphia and outline the history of those kinds of institutions, those social libraries like the Boston Athenaeum that you just mentioned.

03:01.206 --> 03:02.487
And then the

03:03.580 --> 03:26.744
for the start of public libraries, and who was involved in the founding of them, and what the goals were, what societal functions were these libraries serving in the minds of the people who were behind them.

03:27.105 --> 03:29.487
And so there's all kinds of

03:29.872 --> 03:37.784
I mean, we want to get away from the purely institutional sort of approach and deal with other aspects.

03:38.044 --> 03:52.586
Well, just to my mind, and I'm not a professional, but it seems to me you've got the public libraries, you've got the institutional libraries, and you have the national libraries, and I suppose there are many specialized ones in between.

03:52.626 --> 03:53.707
Oh, there are many kinds.

03:53.727 --> 03:56.892
But do you agree that the public libraries in particular...

03:57.614 --> 04:00.777
began more or less as a university for the common people?

04:02.939 --> 04:05.061
And this is a very general question.

04:05.081 --> 04:06.042
You go anywhere you want.

04:06.082 --> 04:07.704
Maybe is it losing that?

04:09.045 --> 04:11.208
Is it drifting away from that function?

04:11.228 --> 04:22.098
Well, certainly the public libraries began, you know, not just to circulate books.

04:23.159 --> 04:26.743
They also were, as you say,

04:26.943 --> 04:29.185
designed to be a university for the people.

04:29.566 --> 04:33.150
They were also to have scholarly stuff with them.

04:33.170 --> 04:38.576
They were to enable any citizen to have access to knowledge.

04:40.257 --> 04:46.104
And yes, they were a university.

04:46.124 --> 04:54.273
We emphasize, we tend to think of them as just, you know, circulating like stuff.

04:54.293 --> 04:54.553
But

04:54.854 --> 05:05.892
But that's a function that they came to have for themselves, whereas they started out to be much more than that.

05:06.012 --> 05:09.077
And I think a good example of that is your own George Tickner.

05:09.598 --> 05:10.199
Absolutely.

05:10.319 --> 05:16.609
Who was here at Harvard and who chose to give his wonderful collection to the Boston Public Library instead of...

05:16.893 --> 05:20.939
He was making a statement of the kind that you're making right now.

05:21.100 --> 05:24.144
And Edward Everett, who, after all, was president of Harvard.

05:24.365 --> 05:28.531
And while he was president of Harvard, was advocating that funds come to the library.

05:28.651 --> 05:29.473
That's right.

05:29.493 --> 05:32.918
But he chose to give his books over to the Boston Public Library.

05:32.938 --> 05:34.681
So they were making that kind of a statement?

05:34.701 --> 05:35.442
Absolutely.

05:36.123 --> 05:38.427
That this material, you know?

05:38.447 --> 05:38.547
Yeah.

05:39.202 --> 05:41.325
we'll have a scholarly application.

05:41.345 --> 05:46.691
Do you find that the public libraries are drifting away from that kind of a mandate?

05:46.711 --> 05:51.116
Oh, I think they're drifting away from the scholarly mandate, to be sure.

05:51.156 --> 06:09.158
What happened, I think, is that the motto of the ALA came to be something, and I don't have it exactly right, but

06:09.982 --> 06:18.555
Probably, but the best books for the most people at the least amount of money.

06:18.595 --> 06:19.657
More bang for the buck.

06:19.677 --> 06:20.858
More bang for the buck.

06:21.680 --> 06:36.943
And inevitably, when an institution is dependent on taxpayer support, you want to be able to demonstrate that you have a high circulation, high use, high visibility.

06:36.983 --> 06:39.246
And the way to do that is to give people...

06:39.513 --> 06:41.996
you know, the books that they want.

06:42.456 --> 07:02.940
But there's a real positive side to giving people books that they want, namely that here, you know, women, for instance, could come into the public library and get, you know, romances.

07:03.420 --> 07:07.765
And scholars are beginning to understand the role of these.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.334
romances in the lives of women.

07:11.394 --> 07:22.732
So that in giving people what they wanted, they were serving a very important function for the community.

07:23.132 --> 07:26.798
And it's not just the scholarly function that's important.

07:27.800 --> 07:35.912
Do you see now with, let's face it, the computers, Bill Gates is pledging millions of dollars, and

07:36.280 --> 07:42.208
real money and millions of dollars and his own software for libraries.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.295
The whole thing in San Francisco was about technology.

07:48.637 --> 08:01.815
Do you think that perhaps public libraries are just extending this idea of giving the people what they want by going into computers and kind of drifting away from printed books?

08:03.128 --> 08:04.109
As many of them are.

08:04.129 --> 08:06.232
I mean, their budgets have been cut for acquisitions.

08:07.433 --> 08:11.497
Yeah, I guess they have been cut for acquisitions.

08:11.518 --> 08:24.733
Although still, and if you talk to Wayne Wiegand, he will tell you that there are more people who come into public libraries and come into McDonald's in the course of a year in America.

08:24.853 --> 08:32.241
He has some figures of this sort that are interesting.

08:32.913 --> 09:01.485
I guess that part of what is important about the computers and why I think it's wonderful that Gates made that gift and obviously one hopes it's going to be followed up with others is that I look at that knowledge width and we're

09:02.022 --> 09:12.454
We are increasingly in a world in which lots of people have access to all kinds of information that they use to make money, don't they?

09:13.355 --> 09:23.786
And I have a daughter who works as a programmer, and she works for Thompson Financial Services.

09:23.806 --> 09:26.669
And I went in there, and I saw the place.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.953
And here are, you know, roads.

09:30.457 --> 09:39.507
of men sitting there and gathering data that is being sold to some people who are using it to make more money.

09:40.709 --> 09:57.948
And to have computers in libraries, to have them accessible to the general public, is going to at least somewhat level the playing field here, isn't it?

09:58.109 --> 09:58.489
Sure.

09:58.823 --> 10:05.033
It seems to me that it's vitally important that libraries get into that.

10:05.053 --> 10:12.905
Of course, you preface this with knowledge wins, and you play through a wonderful World War I poster over there.

10:12.925 --> 10:15.549
And then we talk about information and data.

10:15.690 --> 10:19.976
I mean, there is a difference between information and data and knowledge, isn't there?

10:19.996 --> 10:26.046
And I think this is what a lot of people who are great fans of the information...

10:27.494 --> 10:34.843
the era of information, you know, neglect to realize that data is not knowledge, is it?

10:34.943 --> 10:35.163
No.

10:35.684 --> 10:39.048
It's got to be organized.

10:39.188 --> 10:40.349
It's got to be organized.

10:45.996 --> 10:54.786
You see also at a lot of universities, thankfully not here at Harvard, University of Michigan just built a brand new library, but they don't call it a library.

10:55.287 --> 10:56.168
You know, it's a

10:56.823 --> 11:00.007
information resources, etc., or something like that.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.771
I mean, they're not even calling places libraries anymore.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.874
You have places like Columbia.

11:05.894 --> 11:07.216
They had library schools.

11:07.276 --> 11:08.417
That was the first one.

11:08.497 --> 11:10.980
They got rid of that library school.

11:11.381 --> 11:21.793
Other places where they keep them, like Berkeley, you know, I mean, they kept it with the understanding that it was going to be more computer-oriented.

11:21.813 --> 11:24.296
I mean, they are getting away from books, aren't they?

11:24.476 --> 11:24.957
I don't know.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.422
Does this concern you, I guess?

11:28.462 --> 11:31.946
Well, in a way it doesn't.

11:31.966 --> 11:32.547
It does not.

11:32.727 --> 11:53.070
In a way it does not, because what's happening is that the computer is making it possible for people to have access to text, to the basis for acquiring knowledge,

11:53.455 --> 12:05.112
in a way that books haven't made it possible because you will be able to have access to so much through the web.

12:05.333 --> 12:20.796
I'm considering publishing a work by a man by the name of Ron Bosco who has found some people who commented in great detail on Emerson's last lectures.

12:21.569 --> 12:24.131
And he's a wonderful introduction to this.

12:24.151 --> 12:30.577
And then he wants to print those transcripts in their entirety.

12:32.219 --> 12:49.315
And I argue, and he didn't buy it, but I argue that we would do better to print his introduction and then to put up on the web the text of those documents and that

12:49.514 --> 13:01.426
They would find more users, more readers that way, than they will find sitting in the pages of the Harvard Library bulletin.

13:01.486 --> 13:06.170
And he concedes, actually, that they probably would, but he likes print so much.

13:06.731 --> 13:09.073
How would he be compensated in a case like that?

13:09.513 --> 13:13.838
Well, he's not going to be compensated in any case, is he?

13:13.858 --> 13:19.403
Well, if you printed a book and it sold, he'd get a royalty every time a book sold.

13:19.872 --> 13:22.075
was purchased.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.277
These are little matters that have to be ironed out.

13:24.297 --> 13:24.778
That's right.

13:25.038 --> 13:46.925
But an awful lot of scholarly production has nothing to do with making money from the sales of things, but simply by increasing one's reputation and thereby getting... Well, you find at Stanford, which is a really wired institution, they're doing a very precise thing.

13:46.946 --> 13:48.968
You're finding original work

13:49.488 --> 13:52.772
appearing strictly on the web.

13:53.413 --> 13:58.120
And if you want to read it and you want to hard copy, you download it and print it out, I guess.

14:00.142 --> 14:03.607
So this is something you've proposed.

14:03.627 --> 14:05.149
And whose website would it go out?

14:05.209 --> 14:08.654
Harvard's website or Harvard University Press or Harvard University?

14:08.674 --> 14:10.236
Harvard University Library.

14:12.078 --> 14:16.204
No, I proposed it and he didn't buy it.

14:17.602 --> 14:28.276
And I have a work about the French translations of Adam Smith in which I've transcribed prefaces and used and so on.

14:29.738 --> 14:43.476
And I think that I should take my own advice here, but I probably won't because I too am, you know, I want to see it in print.

14:43.897 --> 14:46.040
Has Harvard ever done anything like this before?

14:46.080 --> 14:46.140
No.

14:48.466 --> 14:50.609
So this would be... Not that I'm aware of.

14:51.851 --> 14:56.397
And we're talking here, this is a pretty significant thing.

14:56.417 --> 14:59.321
I mean, when it happens, and undoubtedly it will happen.

14:59.341 --> 14:59.902
It will happen.

14:59.922 --> 15:04.548
It's not a question of whether or not it will, it's a question of when and with which project.

15:04.689 --> 15:06.411
I get it.

15:06.671 --> 15:11.678
And it would save everyone a lot of money and actually increase access.

15:11.839 --> 15:17.967
You know, as Mike Keller points out at Stanford, he says, you know, look at a lot of these scholarly monographs.

15:18.487 --> 15:31.442
They are published in perhaps maybe 1,000 copy editions, and they cost a tremendous amount of money to buy, and they're probably obsolete the day they come out anyway.

15:32.003 --> 15:42.515
Why not publish something like that here, you know, and update it as necessary, and people who want it can access it, and, you know, it makes sense.

15:42.535 --> 15:43.176
It makes sense.

15:43.276 --> 15:43.917
It does.

15:43.937 --> 15:47.801
It's very hard to argue against, you know, that kind of logic.

15:48.242 --> 15:48.342
Yeah.

15:48.507 --> 15:50.770
And then you see things like the OED.

15:51.731 --> 15:55.455
I can't imagine never doing a published OED again.

15:56.236 --> 16:01.943
Or encyclopedias that are constantly being updated.

16:01.963 --> 16:04.606
But it doesn't work for the book you're doing.

16:04.687 --> 16:06.309
Of course not.

16:09.713 --> 16:13.317
I guess what is really causing people a lot of...

16:14.123 --> 16:37.400
is the fate of the printed book, is the printed book, you know, that people do fear that, you know, when you see San Francisco very quietly piling 200,000 books out down on the tunnel out there and on the dock and not telling anybody about it, that maybe the agenda is to just go strictly all virtual, all digital, and the hell with the printed book.

16:38.462 --> 16:38.983
But I mean...

16:39.267 --> 16:43.896
You know, Harvard certainly makes a statement developed with a printing book, doesn't it?

16:44.217 --> 16:56.280
Well, it was, you know, when you first mentioned San Francisco, I was going to jump in about my sense that

16:56.530 --> 17:06.080
that maybe it represents a certain stage in the relationship between print and electronics.

17:06.120 --> 17:18.714
The first people who were advocates for computers in libraries, they took a lot of heat from the book people.

17:18.734 --> 17:22.898
After all, their products were pretty miserable, weren't they?

17:22.918 --> 17:26.402
You had catalogs without accents in them, and

17:26.703 --> 17:29.466
all the same typeface.

17:29.486 --> 17:36.293
And it was very unpleasant stuff to work with.

17:36.313 --> 17:37.534
It wasn't very good.

17:37.774 --> 17:45.222
And they experienced hostility, and they responded with hostility.

17:45.862 --> 17:54.651
So that I think they got in their head the idea that

17:55.120 --> 18:00.588
In order to build the new, you have to destroy the old.

18:01.329 --> 18:15.991
And economic historians have written about that, that kind of, you know, that, you know, it happens, of course, you know, the automobile destroyed the carriages, didn't it?

18:16.351 --> 18:22.140
And I think that's what they saw themselves as doing.

18:23.032 --> 18:29.459
And Ken Dallin, I think, was one of the first people to get into technology in a big way.

18:29.479 --> 18:34.084
He wrote something in 84, which was on coal published, I think.

18:34.164 --> 18:37.668
He has a demonstrated history.

18:37.708 --> 18:41.812
That's right, yeah.

18:42.313 --> 18:49.360
But I think that now we're coming to recognize...

18:49.694 --> 19:03.376
that the print and electronics are going to exist side by side for a long period of time, that there are going to be different sorts of functions that are served by the two media.

19:03.977 --> 19:14.334
And in any case, that we can't get rid of these books that we have because most of them are never going to be in electronic form.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.018
But maybe some places are getting rid of books

19:18.871 --> 19:27.099
because they find that nobody wants them and that they're superannuated and that maybe they don't even have to be digitized anyway.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.441
That, I think, is the concern.

19:30.202 --> 19:36.068
David Bradbury at the British Library said, you know, it would cost us close to a billion pounds to build a school library.

19:36.088 --> 19:43.135
It has been estimated that if we were going to scan everything, every holding, that it would cost 50 billion pounds.

19:43.155 --> 19:44.096
He said, that's impossible.

19:44.156 --> 19:45.317
That's never going to be done.

19:45.905 --> 19:50.370
And they are a last copy official depository, legal depository.

19:50.831 --> 19:54.855
No, they're going to keep a copy of everything, and that's the way it is, and that's their mission.

19:55.476 --> 19:57.459
But that's the British Library.

19:57.899 --> 20:01.023
Harvard seems to have made a decision that we're going to keep a copy.

20:01.043 --> 20:02.284
We're going to keep a copy, too.

20:02.685 --> 20:03.165
Is that right?

20:03.426 --> 20:08.331
I mean, but other institutions don't have such noble intentions, I guess.

20:09.252 --> 20:15.760
Well, we... Harvard has done some weeding.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.166
I know it.

20:18.567 --> 20:24.493
But very, very little.

20:26.696 --> 20:27.937
Very, very little.

20:28.057 --> 20:40.590
And it tends to have been done in sort of outlying libraries of the system.

20:44.874 --> 20:45.595
For instance,

20:46.385 --> 21:04.431
I know that we used to have a copy of the proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm that goes back to the 18th century and was one of the leading scientific societies of Europe.

21:04.451 --> 21:13.284
And at some point, someone in some physics library or someplace like that decided, who reads this?

21:15.167 --> 21:15.447
And

21:15.646 --> 21:16.567
and got rid of it.

21:17.428 --> 21:18.729
And we don't have it anymore.

21:18.970 --> 21:23.374
We have the German translation of the 18th century, but we don't have that Swedish original.

21:24.415 --> 21:25.296
Does that bother you?

21:25.917 --> 21:27.679
Oh, yeah, a lot.

21:27.799 --> 21:40.232
Now, why does it bother you if everybody's reading it?

21:40.252 --> 21:41.113
Maybe they were right.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.900
Oh, but at this place, you know, there are going to be people who read it.

21:45.920 --> 21:50.012
As a matter of fact, I read Swedish, and I've wanted to consult, you know.

21:50.494 --> 21:52.781
Is that how you discovered it was gone?

21:53.001 --> 21:55.609
Yes, yes, that's how I discovered it was gone.

21:55.876 --> 21:57.258
You wanted to look at it yourself?

21:57.278 --> 21:58.660
I wanted to look at it myself.

21:58.780 --> 22:02.746
And what was your, did you do an investigation?

22:02.766 --> 22:08.655
No, I just couldn't, there was no point in trying to find out exactly what happened.

22:08.675 --> 22:09.977
No paperwork?

22:10.057 --> 22:15.164
No, there was no paper trail as to who'd done it.

22:15.325 --> 22:16.627
I mean, you don't think it was stolen.

22:16.907 --> 22:17.648
Why would anybody steal it?

22:17.881 --> 22:20.204
That's a consideration.

22:20.224 --> 22:24.491
It's conceivable, but it's a big set of books.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.753
Better than a library.

22:27.695 --> 22:28.136
That's right.

22:28.256 --> 22:31.321
I would doubt that anyone had stolen it.

22:31.942 --> 22:37.590
But Harvard is... We have students from all over the place here.

22:38.151 --> 22:44.861
And I used to be in charge of a library of early economic literature over at the business school.

22:44.881 --> 22:45.762
And I'd have

22:46.180 --> 22:59.903
I bought one year a book from about 1840 in Swedish about trade with China, and damn that the next year there didn't come over a student.

23:01.013 --> 23:04.877
and want to see that book and say, gee, I never expected you'd have it.

23:06.078 --> 23:07.139
He knew the book.

23:07.159 --> 23:07.459
Yes.

23:07.479 --> 23:10.822
He knew the book, number one, and was flabbergasted to see that you had it.

23:10.842 --> 23:12.224
Yes, yes.

23:12.244 --> 23:14.446
Now, how does that make you feel, as a librarian?

23:14.706 --> 23:15.567
Just wonderful.

23:15.847 --> 23:17.148
Yeah, that's what your job is, isn't it?

23:17.248 --> 23:19.190
Exactly, exactly.

23:19.210 --> 23:23.755
And maybe, you know, when you first acquired it, it might have been 84 years, as in my case.

23:23.795 --> 23:24.836
It could easily have been.

23:24.976 --> 23:27.338
But the payoff here was immediate, wasn't it?

23:27.979 --> 23:28.079
Yeah.

23:28.179 --> 23:29.400
But you are applying...

23:29.920 --> 23:35.605
the 20-year rule or the 30-year rule, that somebody might need this book 20 or 30 years from now.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.168
I mean, did you have that kind of thought in mind?

23:38.428 --> 23:40.910
Oh, we don't apply a 20- or 30-year rule.

23:41.350 --> 23:42.772
I mean, it's much longer than that.

23:43.312 --> 23:57.345
I mean, I bought books that were uncut, you know, and it was clear that they'd never been used, you know, in the 200 years since they'd been printed.

23:57.646 --> 23:59.408
But that was fine, you know.

23:59.609 --> 24:05.897
I figured that someday someone would come along and use it.

24:06.298 --> 24:24.683
And when you begin to have, I don't know what percentage of the world's economic literature was in the Kress Library, but when you begin to have, you know, 20%, 30%, 50%, 60% of a whole body of literature, you know,

24:25.287 --> 24:32.116
how much more useful it becomes when you can continue to increase that quantity.

24:32.316 --> 24:44.011
My last conversation with Roger started that he explained quite eloquently for me the difference between a research collection and a specimen collection.

24:44.091 --> 24:53.843
Harvard goes for research collection, where you really do get a mass of material, and then the weight of the whole thing really...

24:54.127 --> 25:00.995
enables the scholar to come and do serious work, which is not, you know, that's what you're saying.

25:01.015 --> 25:06.801
If you have 60 percent of the literature on a subject, you know, you've got something.

25:06.821 --> 25:07.021
Exactly.

25:07.041 --> 25:23.239
You know, in the old days, old days, like 10 or 15 years ago, but traditionally, you know, you have judged an institution, an academic institution, its reputation to great measure

25:23.810 --> 25:26.995
was built by the holdings, by the size of its collections.

25:27.496 --> 25:28.678
Do you think that still applies?

25:29.459 --> 25:33.044
I mean, Harvard has 14 million books or whatever, you know.

25:33.886 --> 25:43.220
And Barton Gregorian, who I've interviewed for this, you know, in nine years, built the Brown collections from two million to three million, whatever it was.

25:43.841 --> 25:44.863
And that was important to him.

25:45.624 --> 25:49.590
And I asked him, you know, do numbers still matter?

25:49.791 --> 25:50.351
What do you think?

25:50.512 --> 25:51.353
Do they still matter?

25:53.240 --> 25:56.625
Or do you disagree with the contention that they ever met at all?

25:57.426 --> 26:05.697
Well, it is pretty clear that a lot of faculty come here because of the library, you know.

26:06.278 --> 26:11.906
And I don't think they think of it in terms of numbers, per se.

26:11.926 --> 26:15.371
But they know, will know that in classics, you know.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.516
That's a simplified way of, you know, the numbers, yeah.

26:18.556 --> 26:20.118
But the collection, the stuff is there.

26:20.398 --> 26:22.261
It's the collection because the stuff is here.

26:22.301 --> 26:23.162
And they come here.

26:23.345 --> 26:26.931
And we know that to be the case.

26:26.951 --> 26:28.012
You think that's still the case?

26:28.152 --> 26:29.715
It's still the case.

26:29.735 --> 26:44.698
Would you still, you know, into the mix of judging an institution, would you take into account, you know, the size and the extent of its libraries, of the holdings in its library?

26:44.718 --> 26:46.320
Would you think that would still apply to it?

26:46.341 --> 26:50.567
Yes, I think so.

26:51.037 --> 27:10.125
What I think confuses the issue, perhaps, is that you find a scholar who's working, say, who's doing biblical criticism and is able to have the Bible up in the computer and have all kinds of versions, you know,

27:10.409 --> 27:22.545
on the computer, or someone who's doing medieval studies and has the text from Minya up there on the computer.

27:23.486 --> 27:33.680
And people, you know, make a career out of analyzing the use of language and the use of words.

27:36.203 --> 27:40.028
So there are certain, you know, narrow ways

27:40.328 --> 27:46.521
areas where the rest of it doesn't matter, all of it doesn't matter.

27:47.122 --> 28:01.172
But by and large, the historians, you can never do history without this kind of magnificent collection.

28:01.726 --> 28:04.529
Are you a friend of the Harvard Library?

28:04.549 --> 28:04.930
Always.

28:05.110 --> 28:16.943
Because you've got that special issue of the Bulletin about Widener Library, Voices from the Stacks, in which faculty members wrote about the kind of use that they made.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.164
Is that the very recent one?

28:18.925 --> 28:20.287
Well, it's quite recent.

28:22.069 --> 28:24.351
I've been a friend for five years, and I teach everything.

28:24.371 --> 28:29.998
Can I take this?

28:30.258 --> 28:31.159
Yeah, sure.

28:36.016 --> 28:52.231
But these faculty members, you know, write about what the library means to them in a way that, you know, that is often, you know, truly eloquent.

28:52.311 --> 28:58.957
Can we talk a little bit about the whole idea of the depository, the concept of it?

28:59.638 --> 29:04.302
And you mentioned earlier that this is one of your responsibilities.

29:04.535 --> 29:09.921
First of all, Jeff, if you could just give me briefly, you know, you mentioned that you were crushed for some time before you came.

29:10.154 --> 29:22.988
Could you just give me... And then in 1980, I moved over to, you know, when Oscar Hanlon was director of the library, I moved over to be responsible for publications.

29:23.008 --> 29:24.110
I see.

29:24.310 --> 29:27.353
And publications including, you know, microforms.

29:27.373 --> 29:37.504
And I worked with outfits like university microfilms and so on to make our holdings more accessible in microfilms.

29:38.125 --> 29:38.946
And...

29:39.517 --> 30:04.630
And then, I guess it was about 1991, the issue of storage was pulling the place apart in that the librarians tended to want to

30:05.875 --> 30:08.418
deal with storage in one of two ways.

30:08.458 --> 30:11.541
One was to send out whole classes of material.

30:12.162 --> 30:17.487
And church history, for instance, was often cited as a favor to send out.

30:18.288 --> 30:31.802
But of course, this was reflecting a modern anti-clerical view of the world, whereas all kinds of historians use church history heavily.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.245
And

30:34.715 --> 30:41.342
Or another approach often favored by librarians was to deal with things with the computer.

30:41.823 --> 30:46.748
Or, you know, if it hasn't circulated, send it out to the depository.

30:49.411 --> 30:55.477
I said, with a lot of chutzpah, I'll solve the problem.

30:55.497 --> 30:55.778
He said.

30:56.218 --> 30:58.240
Yes.

30:58.260 --> 31:01.684
I said, I will send out, you know, books.

31:02.305 --> 31:13.938
I will select what should go out to the Harvard Depository, and I will keep the faculty happy in the process.

31:14.779 --> 31:26.372
And one of the most unhappy faculty was a man by the name of Shevchenko, Ihor Shevchenko,

31:26.690 --> 31:34.878
Ukrainian from the Ukraine, medievalist, someone who knows a dozen languages.

31:36.179 --> 31:51.213
And I started to write a document about how to select for stories and to explain the whole business.

31:51.233 --> 31:55.377
And I'd give them drafts of it.

31:55.918 --> 31:56.258
And

31:56.542 --> 32:00.986
We would have lunch, and then he would ask me questions.

32:01.007 --> 32:04.830
On the basis of the questions he asked me, I'd find out what was unclear.

32:04.850 --> 32:08.374
I mean, these weren't just gentle questions.

32:08.454 --> 32:11.998
I mean, he was pushing at me all the time.

32:12.738 --> 32:26.312
And ultimately, I had something that I knew that it was clear because he got it.

32:27.305 --> 32:30.030
and that other faculty members would get it as well.

32:30.651 --> 32:37.182
And then went up to the Philol class up on the fifth floor with colleagues.

32:37.563 --> 32:40.788
Philol, P-H-I-L-O-L, Philology.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.755
And it's where a lot of the learned journals are.

32:45.256 --> 32:51.186
We went up with a number of classicists and medievalists, and I'd gone...

32:51.520 --> 32:57.670
advance, and I had a list of serials to send out to HD.

32:58.431 --> 33:01.075
This is the early 90s now, about 91, you said?

33:01.395 --> 33:03.458
Yeah, 91, 92.

33:04.861 --> 33:12.853
And I started on the list, and agreed, yeah, that could go out to HD.

33:13.188 --> 33:16.432
And one of his colleagues said, quick, where's a camera?

33:16.552 --> 33:20.816
You know, Ihor agreeing to send something out to the Harvard Depository.

33:21.797 --> 33:33.210
And I'd have meetings with, you know, an historian, and would go into the stacks and have things to suggest that could go out through HD.

33:33.590 --> 33:40.798
And we'd talk, have lunch, and I'd write up the meeting so that the guy knew he'd been heard.

33:42.112 --> 33:54.869
and gradually, you know, it was... They really thought that what we were doing was weeding.

33:55.350 --> 33:58.073
I think that's what was basically in their mind.

33:58.093 --> 33:59.195
That is my question.

33:59.235 --> 34:02.099
Why was there so much anxiety about sending stuff out?

34:02.119 --> 34:04.802
I think it's because they thought it was weeding.

34:04.822 --> 34:07.686
They thought it was basically cover for getting rid of stuff.

34:07.706 --> 34:08.387
Exactly.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.650
They didn't trust us.

34:10.951 --> 34:12.333
And, you know, for good reason.

34:12.633 --> 34:17.459
Because librarians like to do things and then inform the faculty afterwards.

34:17.640 --> 34:18.380
Safe and complete.

34:18.401 --> 34:18.861
That's right.

34:18.881 --> 34:20.563
Again, going back to San Francisco.

34:20.583 --> 34:21.004
That's right.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.065
It was done.

34:22.085 --> 34:23.026
That's right.

34:23.046 --> 34:25.209
That has been a standard operating procedure.

34:25.229 --> 34:27.692
And that's what they're doing at Cornell, by the way.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.455
There hasn't been any talk about it.

34:30.095 --> 34:35.102
You know, and I asked them, gee, you know, you send books off to the landfill?

34:35.122 --> 34:36.664
And she tells us, she says, the landfill.

34:36.684 --> 34:39.928
I mean, this is Ann Kenney, nice woman, very capable person.

34:40.246 --> 34:45.414
I said, do you at least allow people to come in and take some of these books?

34:46.095 --> 34:46.315
No.

34:46.615 --> 34:51.202
And, of course, the reason is they don't want the public knowing about this.

34:51.863 --> 34:52.824
Better to have it done.

34:53.385 --> 34:54.347
This is what we did.

34:55.288 --> 34:56.249
And it's done.

34:56.329 --> 34:56.670
Sorry.

34:56.710 --> 35:05.022
And so there must be this apprehension on the part of a lot of people who are aware of the fact that

35:05.440 --> 35:07.543
You know, sometimes you have to expedite.

35:07.563 --> 35:11.748
You have to break eggs to make almonds, I guess.

35:11.788 --> 35:13.210
But I don't think you have to.

35:13.911 --> 35:17.075
I think you can deal with the fears.

35:17.936 --> 35:21.240
And once you've dealt with the fears, then you can go ahead.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.423
And, you know.

35:28.088 --> 35:30.992
So I don't...

35:31.799 --> 35:44.017
I don't go into a section and take it apart without the faculty members involved knowing that I'm doing it.

35:44.057 --> 35:46.221
A recent example was the Celtic class.

35:48.484 --> 35:49.426
Celtic stuff?

35:49.446 --> 35:57.458
Yeah, and people in the field like Celtic are already edgy because it's a very small department.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.063
And it's going to be acts.

36:01.567 --> 36:06.074
And it's just a first step to axing the department.

36:06.775 --> 36:12.082
And so you have to talk to them.

36:13.024 --> 36:16.849
And I don't happen to read the cultic languages.

36:21.256 --> 36:31.270
But a graduate student is going through, using the guidelines that the faculty members and I agreed on, and pulling stuff.

36:31.638 --> 36:33.100
listing stuff for storage.

36:34.202 --> 36:38.429
So how much material have you sent out to yourself, what would you say?

36:38.529 --> 36:42.456
Oh, I've sent out hundreds of thousands, you know.

36:43.898 --> 36:45.621
In about four years, five years?

36:45.901 --> 36:48.646
Yeah, yeah.

36:50.148 --> 36:54.996
We reorganized the process of actually sending out

36:55.499 --> 36:57.121
the book, because I can take you downstairs.

36:57.141 --> 36:58.644
You might be interested in seeing that.

36:58.664 --> 37:05.594
I would, and also, if it's at all possible, you mentioned that you drafted guidelines for selection.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.317
Is this something that I could get a copy of?

37:07.357 --> 37:08.118
Oh, sure.

37:08.138 --> 37:10.622
Because I'd quote from it, and I'd cite it.

37:10.642 --> 37:11.523
Sure, by all means.

37:11.543 --> 37:14.248
This is part of, you know, how are books?

37:14.308 --> 37:16.952
How do you decide which books?

37:17.032 --> 37:18.073
It's almost like the surgeon.

37:18.093 --> 37:19.756
Who do you decide gets the transplant?

37:19.896 --> 37:24.443
And I'm sure a lot of these people, these professors feel that way.

37:24.895 --> 37:41.834
You know, you're making a life-and-death decision about... Well, there is a medievalist who was, you know, co-chair of the library committee who said, you know, you have more influence on scholarship at Harvard than just Neil Rudenstein.

37:42.295 --> 37:46.039
Well, he was exaggerating, but... Was he smiling when he said it?

37:46.059 --> 37:49.082
Well, he was smiling when he said it.

37:49.102 --> 37:50.223
But there was an undertone there.

37:50.243 --> 37:51.785
There was an undertone there.

37:52.005 --> 37:54.328
And...

37:54.595 --> 38:10.536
So it's fascinating work, you see, because, you know, I figure that there's no one who handles more books and talks to more intelligent and interesting people than do I on a regular basis.

38:10.896 --> 38:13.780
And so it's fascinating.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.864
That's because they do take the books very, very seriously.

38:17.085 --> 38:18.026
How about the Ukrainian?

38:18.046 --> 38:18.767
Is he still here?

38:19.268 --> 38:24.214
Well, he's retired now, but...

38:25.072 --> 38:29.239
He's around, and he and I are friends.

38:29.540 --> 38:45.227
I'm just asking this because I am, it may be too ambitious, but I am thinking about an Eastern European post-Soviet book culture chapter, you know, how it's changed so dramatically.

38:45.267 --> 38:48.092
I mean, the whole attitude about books and what the function of books and

38:48.595 --> 38:50.678
And, of course, we talk about computers here.

38:50.758 --> 38:52.421
They talk about paperclips there.

38:52.441 --> 38:56.147
I mean, can we afford paperclips or a typewriter ribbon, you know?

38:56.307 --> 38:57.328
Yeah, yeah.

38:57.909 --> 39:00.493
Did you see the issue of Daedalus about libraries?

39:00.513 --> 39:04.980
Yes, I have that, that I have, yeah.

39:05.080 --> 39:13.673
One thing I hope to do with this book is have a really good bibliography, as I did with General Redness, I think.

39:13.693 --> 39:16.037
Yes, it's a good bibliography.

39:16.844 --> 39:18.206
People like to know.

39:18.226 --> 39:20.951
I'm just looking at your books over there now to see which ones.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.032
Yeah, I got that one.

39:22.513 --> 39:23.194
I got that one.

39:23.234 --> 39:25.678
I collect on the history of libraries.

39:27.581 --> 39:30.186
Any titles you can suggest on European?

39:30.226 --> 39:34.392
I'm really looking for anecdotal things.

39:34.432 --> 39:37.317
This is kind of going off the path a little bit here, but do you mind...

39:37.820 --> 39:40.444
Well, before we go, if I take a few fast notes.

39:41.085 --> 39:45.852
No, I suppose... It doesn't have to be right now, but... I mean, obviously you have these treasures.

39:45.872 --> 39:50.438
Why don't you tell me your formal title here, so we have it?

39:50.458 --> 39:53.463
It's Assistant Director for Research Resources.

39:55.366 --> 39:55.546
Okay.

39:55.686 --> 40:00.233
Do you have a VTAC thing that I could have, or so you could mail to me, or whatever?

40:00.253 --> 40:02.977
Yeah, let me make a look.

40:02.997 --> 40:05.881
Instead of, you know, here's my card.

40:05.901 --> 40:06.662
And I'll mail.

40:06.946 --> 40:11.592
and the documents about the story.

40:11.612 --> 40:14.235
That would be great.

40:15.477 --> 40:22.226
Yeah, this is very, very... This chapter is starting in that Harvard Depository.

40:22.326 --> 40:28.594
Now, were you involved in the planning and the input of the needs and stuff out there at the depository?

40:30.577 --> 40:30.817
No.

40:31.297 --> 40:35.603
And I think almost no one in the library was involved in it.

40:36.140 --> 40:45.212
in that what Oscar Hanlon did was... I mean, he really... And he's upstairs.

40:45.872 --> 40:46.433
He's still here.

40:46.573 --> 40:47.274
He's still here.

40:47.775 --> 40:49.337
Should I talk to him at some point, do you think?

40:50.158 --> 40:50.298
Oh.

40:51.319 --> 40:53.222
If you can get him to talk, you know.

40:53.242 --> 40:53.722
Oh, I see.

40:53.742 --> 40:57.647
I mean, he's... Well, I mean, he's exceedingly taciturn.

40:58.528 --> 40:58.849
Uh-huh.

40:59.430 --> 41:02.113
And... And I...

41:03.106 --> 41:09.632
I worked with him for a number of years, and I don't think I ever had a meeting that lasted longer than five minutes, you know.

41:09.953 --> 41:11.394
But what did he do then?

41:11.414 --> 41:14.016
You said what Oscar Handelman did to having some more pain to let him do.

41:14.036 --> 41:31.493
Well, I think what he did was that he saw that if he tried to get librarians to agree on the need for this and how they were going to use it, et cetera, et cetera,

41:31.810 --> 41:39.120
that it would never get built because of partly the decentralized nature of the institution.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.604
This is the wisdom of years working here, isn't it?

41:43.105 --> 41:45.147
Yeah, exactly.

41:45.648 --> 41:59.286
And so he called in the Iron Mountain storage people and they were the ones who did the planning of it and they were

41:59.502 --> 42:01.465
going to run it.

42:01.685 --> 42:11.961
So he treated it initially as an engineering problem, not as a philosophical problem or as an institutional situation, I guess, is what you're saying.

42:12.883 --> 42:14.245
I guess that's it.

42:14.265 --> 42:18.231
I mean, yeah, I think that's what he did.

42:18.251 --> 42:19.613
Let's build the best facility.

42:19.653 --> 42:25.763
We're talking about preservation, air, transportation, logistical matters.

42:26.148 --> 42:28.932
And it was a, if you build it, they will use it.

42:29.653 --> 42:30.875
They will use it.

42:31.135 --> 42:31.656
The will.

42:32.117 --> 42:32.377
Yes.

42:33.959 --> 42:38.346
They will.

42:39.447 --> 42:50.543
You know, the emphasis can go whichever way, but he clearly perceived the need and decided that he was going to take a Gordian not approach to resolving it, I suppose.

42:50.563 --> 42:50.964
That's right.

42:50.984 --> 42:51.865
I think that's what you're saying.

42:52.045 --> 42:52.646
Exactly.

42:53.267 --> 42:54.028
That's what I'm saying.

42:54.194 --> 43:02.124
And so then once it was there, and now we enter into the procedures for stocking it.

43:02.304 --> 43:02.764
That's right.

43:03.025 --> 43:04.887
And that's, I guess, where you come in, right?

43:05.187 --> 43:07.610
That's where you enter the equation.

43:08.151 --> 43:11.715
But I only do it for a wider.

43:11.795 --> 43:22.328
But that first phone call was the librarian at the Fine Arts Library asking me if I would come over and talk with them and the faculty over there about how I do it.

43:22.865 --> 43:40.527
Well, from Widener, the total number of volumes stored out there is 1,370,000 at the moment.

43:40.807 --> 43:41.848
Just from Widener?

43:41.868 --> 43:42.629
Just from Widener.

43:43.611 --> 43:48.096
And there's also, of course, from other places.

43:48.312 --> 43:56.904
Because a lot of records from other parts of the university are stored and archives and the other institutions.

43:57.004 --> 43:59.448
And last year we sent out 131,000.

43:59.468 --> 43:59.548
Wow.

44:00.009 --> 44:05.196
So that's not all from the stacks, unfortunately.

44:05.236 --> 44:10.604
Some of it's from new acquisitions.

44:10.624 --> 44:11.565
New acquisitions?

44:11.725 --> 44:13.808
You're buying new stuff and sending it directly there?

44:14.249 --> 44:14.509
Yeah.

44:15.150 --> 44:15.771
Because...

44:16.645 --> 44:17.826
What kinds of things?

44:17.846 --> 44:18.347
Journals?

44:19.068 --> 44:26.817
Well, yeah, there's some guidelines on that, too, and I'll send them.

44:26.837 --> 44:30.081
That's pretty interesting, why new things would not stay out there.

44:30.181 --> 44:30.982
I'll send them.

44:31.002 --> 44:33.365
That isn't really buying for the future, then, isn't it?

44:33.786 --> 44:44.138
Yeah, and I was terribly worried about drawing up guidelines for new ones, because I figured that someone...

44:44.371 --> 44:50.901
might say, well, you know, if we can send these out right at the beginning, maybe we shouldn't be buying them.

44:50.921 --> 44:55.969
But for some reason, no one ever did that.

44:56.991 --> 45:04.021
Once money is taken out of the budget to buy things, it's very hard to get it back in.

45:04.402 --> 45:12.294
I'm an old naval officer, too, and I remember, once you say, oh, we don't need the money for that, you never get that money back again if you need it, either.

45:12.314 --> 45:12.775
You know?

45:13.025 --> 45:18.191
And about 55,000 items came back last year from the Harvard Depository.

45:18.211 --> 45:20.334
Well, yeah, I want to talk about that.

45:20.534 --> 45:27.162
Is a lot of that, do you think, faculty people putting in a request for stuff just to get it back?

45:28.043 --> 45:33.750
Will I be able to get some of those figures, by the way, of stuff that's there?

45:33.770 --> 45:36.774
You can just put that on your list.

45:37.455 --> 45:38.496
I'd love to know the numbers.

45:39.357 --> 45:40.939
I'll give you the numbers.

45:41.189 --> 45:45.375
You can just say them and I'll pick them up off the page.

45:46.417 --> 45:49.902
No, I'll give you the numbers so you have the exact numbers.

45:50.522 --> 45:56.571
I'm not sure people would necessarily be delighted with my giving you the numbers, but that's okay.

45:56.591 --> 45:58.113
I don't have the cypress source either.

45:58.354 --> 46:00.216
No, it's okay.

46:00.517 --> 46:01.659
That's fine.

46:01.679 --> 46:01.999
And...

46:03.127 --> 46:04.469
I mean, you're not getting rid of the books.

46:04.649 --> 46:06.772
This is the right part.

46:07.053 --> 46:07.714
No, that's right.

46:07.794 --> 46:10.218
We're not getting rid of it.

46:10.298 --> 46:12.160
People are sending books to landfills, you know.

46:12.180 --> 46:12.841
That's right.

46:12.861 --> 46:14.664
That's right.

46:14.684 --> 46:20.433
I don't, you know, these are books that are being recalled for use.

46:20.673 --> 46:24.559
These are not books that are being recalled to be placed back on the shelves.

46:24.899 --> 46:25.881
We have some of that.

46:26.241 --> 46:30.488
You know, we have books that are recalled to be placed back on the shelves.

46:30.648 --> 46:30.788
Mm-hmm.

46:31.122 --> 46:34.628
because they're mistakes.

46:35.951 --> 46:50.777
For reasons that I don't understand, Richard Pipes' latest work on the history of Russia was sent out to the Harvard Depository when it arrived.

46:51.939 --> 46:53.502
Richard Pipes, you know, was

46:53.819 --> 47:02.589
presidential advisor and one of the most respected, you know, Sovietologists, and it was sent out.

47:02.710 --> 47:03.571
Well, it happened.

47:03.591 --> 47:05.253
It happened.

47:05.273 --> 47:07.415
It's back.

47:07.595 --> 47:11.860
Ryan says the turnaround is 24 hours, so what's the problem?

47:12.021 --> 47:13.122
That's right.

47:13.142 --> 47:20.110
You know, and he said if somebody wants to pay 50 bucks, he can get it back within the hour or 100 bucks or whatever it is.

47:20.511 --> 47:21.492
Yeah.

47:21.512 --> 47:22.253
You know?

47:22.273 --> 47:22.373
Yeah.

47:22.393 --> 47:22.493
Yeah.

47:22.878 --> 47:28.024
And the book is not... We're not talking about major catastrophe here.

47:28.044 --> 47:29.305
That's right, exactly.

47:29.425 --> 47:36.573
What is... I think that ultimately you have the room to do about 20 of these modules.

47:36.593 --> 47:38.115
Is that about... I thought it was 10.

47:38.135 --> 47:38.715
Is it 10?

47:39.977 --> 47:40.437
It was 10.

47:40.517 --> 47:46.043
10 modules, but 2 million volumes, so that's where you get the 20 million.

47:46.123 --> 47:48.726
It may even be 2.5 million in each one.

47:48.806 --> 47:49.247
Maybe.

47:50.428 --> 47:52.210
And to look at one of these things...

47:52.949 --> 47:53.910
I mean, it's amazing.

47:53.930 --> 47:54.531
It's awesome.

47:54.691 --> 47:55.292
It's awesome.

47:55.752 --> 47:58.095
And the computer makes it all possible.

47:58.115 --> 48:01.278
As Ron Lane says, he said, I could have this a great quote.

48:01.298 --> 48:02.740
It'll be in the book.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.463
If I had the Gutenberg Bible, it'd have a barcode on it.

48:06.043 --> 48:06.444
That's right.

48:06.464 --> 48:08.165
I mean, I wouldn't know what was in that box.

48:09.106 --> 48:19.878
I mean, it's by size and barcodes, and it's the customer, he calls you the customer, who decides, you know, the item.

48:19.918 --> 48:21.640
The barcode is issued, and

48:21.957 --> 48:26.221
and they're claimed by the computer, tells them the order in which to take things out.

48:26.661 --> 48:28.924
Little ones up here, big ones down here.

48:29.544 --> 48:30.605
It's fascinating.

48:30.705 --> 48:30.885
It is.

48:30.965 --> 48:32.747
You could not do that without a computer.

48:33.868 --> 48:33.928
No.

48:33.948 --> 48:34.769
At all.

48:34.789 --> 48:35.890
No, you couldn't.

48:36.631 --> 48:40.334
So we have to, you know, you can't be a Luddite in this and this.

48:41.055 --> 48:42.076
That's right.

48:42.096 --> 48:42.476
That's right.

48:42.496 --> 48:43.998
No, no.

48:44.338 --> 48:50.884
And we still find...

48:51.168 --> 48:55.615
occasionally in the Widener Stack, the 16th century book.

48:55.635 --> 48:58.019
And we find... Wow, we're kidding.

48:59.501 --> 49:01.184
That should be over at Hope, maybe.

49:01.204 --> 49:04.649
Yeah, and there are lots of 18th century books.

49:04.669 --> 49:14.104
I mean, the woman who stopped in, you know, while you were here, you know, in my hand.

49:14.489 --> 49:18.595
Was that a case of she found something in the general stacks?

49:18.636 --> 49:22.482
Maybe suggesting that that should go to Houghton?

49:22.502 --> 49:34.400
Well, what we do is this I will send out to the Harvard Depository.

49:34.841 --> 49:36.143
So what is it, just for the record?

49:36.477 --> 49:37.818
What is the book?

49:37.838 --> 49:42.542
Oh, the record is in German.

49:42.662 --> 49:54.152
It's a book called Remarks on Russia with regard to its sciences, art, religion, and other remarkable matters.

49:55.133 --> 49:56.535
Erfurt, 1788.

49:58.436 --> 50:06.163
And what I...

50:06.616 --> 50:26.441
This, when it's next recalled then, it will be recalled to the Houghton reading room so that it will be used under conditions there rather than someone taking it out of Widener and spilling coffee on it.

50:26.641 --> 50:29.485
So a decision, is this a decision?

50:31.523 --> 50:32.945
kind of an informal decision.

50:33.025 --> 50:39.413
Now, Gene Ashton and Columbia, they've got a cute little phrase down there now for books they've designated medium rare.

50:40.675 --> 50:41.876
It's kind of cute.

50:41.896 --> 50:51.749
Books that really aren't eligible for, you know, rare book status, but maybe they're fragile and they're old and they really shouldn't be in general circulation either.

50:52.189 --> 50:59.218
And so they take them aside and a scholar or a student can take it out, look at it here, but you can't take it out

50:59.519 --> 51:07.491
an individual decision will be made whether or not I can go through the Xerox copy or, you know, but they're treating them with just a little bit more attention and care.

51:08.392 --> 51:11.377
Is this kind of a similar thing that's happening here?

51:11.397 --> 51:15.082
Well, what we... Your staff is finding things and bringing them to you.

51:15.282 --> 51:27.180
Over the years, of course, Houghton has, you know, many times been throughout parts of the Widener Stack, but because of the size of it, you know, and because...

51:27.734 --> 51:57.454
perception of what is wanted in Houghton changes there's a lot of stuff there but but our policy is that is that we will essentially send anything before 1821 out to the depository for recall in Houghton um

51:57.788 --> 51:59.390
How do you pick 1821?

52:00.632 --> 52:13.610
Well, because it really is just about the time that printing technology changed and about the start of the year of modern scholarship.

52:14.931 --> 52:19.438
So these were the reasons for it.

52:19.458 --> 52:24.825
But we also have but one rule in the storage space.

52:25.328 --> 52:35.742
and this is worked out in conjunction with the faculty, that there is no inviolate rule.

52:37.204 --> 52:45.595
In other words, there are some books that will stay in the Widener Stacks, even though they're 17th century books.

52:45.615 --> 52:51.583
And an example is the Acta Sanctorum, The Lives of the Saints.

52:51.603 --> 52:53.426
It started in the 17th century.

52:53.446 --> 52:55.048
These are large volumes.

52:55.484 --> 52:58.068
And they're, you know, they're indispensable.

52:59.510 --> 53:06.359
And they've been used so much over the years that they don't have artifactual value anymore.

53:06.380 --> 53:09.324
So, you know, we keep them in the stack.

53:09.464 --> 53:11.807
And, you know, the fact is they are being used.

53:12.148 --> 53:13.490
That's right.

53:13.510 --> 53:19.418
If they're just taking up space for the occasional reader, then, you know... That's right.

53:19.438 --> 53:20.800
Then they can go out for space.

53:21.016 --> 53:31.468
But I accumulate, and I've got to make some room on those shelves behind you, I accumulate stuff back on those shelves for Roger.

53:32.469 --> 53:43.922
And every month or so, he'll come over and we'll have a sandwich here, and then he'll take what he wants from it.

53:46.866 --> 53:49.909
And I find some very nice stuff.

53:50.108 --> 53:53.392
How many books are there in Widener?

53:53.412 --> 53:54.693
Two and a half million?

53:54.713 --> 53:55.154
Is that about it?

53:55.174 --> 54:03.803
Well, I think because it includes Cusey as well, it's more like four million.

54:03.943 --> 54:06.726
And Harvard, I guess, says about 90 libraries.

54:06.886 --> 54:07.667
It's always about.

54:07.687 --> 54:09.529
We never really know exactly how many.

54:09.549 --> 54:13.754
Well, it all depends how you define libraries, isn't it?

54:14.334 --> 54:17.618
And that includes some rooms here and there.

54:18.053 --> 54:24.500
Well, I remember I did an interview years ago at one of the houses, and there was Matheson's Library.

54:25.641 --> 54:27.143
It's magnificent.

54:27.163 --> 54:32.388
Is that a library, or is that more or less... That's kind of one of the things you're talking about, I think.

54:32.548 --> 54:36.092
And that's not really in our domain, so to speak.

54:36.112 --> 54:39.556
So it doesn't get included in that number.

54:39.576 --> 54:46.643
But it's certainly there, and these are inscribed books and things, and they may have something interesting that somebody...

54:47.264 --> 54:49.366
at some point might want to take a look at it.

54:49.386 --> 54:52.529
But I think that's the kind of thing that you're talking about.

54:52.550 --> 54:54.231
And you have libraries.

54:54.251 --> 54:55.793
You have one in Italy, isn't that right?

54:55.813 --> 54:55.973
Yes.

54:56.013 --> 54:58.095
Another one at Dunbarton Oaks.

55:01.779 --> 55:02.680
Dunbarton Oaks.

55:02.700 --> 55:02.980
In Washington.

55:03.000 --> 55:03.221
Yeah.

55:03.241 --> 55:04.582
Interesting.

55:04.602 --> 55:04.762
Yeah.

55:05.043 --> 55:14.332
And some of them are larger than, you know, even outside Widener, there are a few that are larger than most college libraries.

55:14.392 --> 55:16.875
Well, I mean, you mentioned the business school library.

55:16.915 --> 55:17.035
That's

55:17.690 --> 55:18.892
And the law school.

55:18.932 --> 55:20.775
And the law school and the medical school.

55:21.196 --> 55:23.539
And Harvard, Yan Cheng.

55:25.142 --> 55:30.450
And these are wonderful libraries with extraordinary special collections.

55:30.470 --> 55:31.051
That's right.

55:31.071 --> 55:35.438
I mean, Houghton is not the only special collections library at Harvard.

55:36.179 --> 55:40.526
I mean, this really remains an institution of the book.

55:42.269 --> 55:42.729
It is.

55:43.471 --> 55:44.372
Exactly.

55:44.588 --> 55:45.410
Exactly.

55:45.790 --> 55:47.514
And it's one of the great libraries of the world.

55:47.534 --> 55:52.082
And it's one of the great libraries of the world, and clearly Harvard is mindful of that.

55:53.044 --> 55:57.532
And, you know, you mentioned earlier when we started that you're toying.

55:57.613 --> 56:01.941
It's kind of like you're toying with the idea of trying to publish something on the web.

56:02.221 --> 56:03.584
And this would be the first occasion.

56:03.604 --> 56:05.147
It would be momentous, wouldn't it?

56:05.167 --> 56:06.610
Yes.

56:06.630 --> 56:06.850
Yes.

56:07.015 --> 56:09.818
Yes, I really wanted to do it.

56:11.600 --> 56:12.741
I couldn't persuade him.

56:12.921 --> 56:15.243
Kind of like letting your hair down a little bit, right?

56:16.064 --> 56:19.768
I also said, you know, we can make a big deal out of this.

56:20.709 --> 56:31.420
And I don't know whether that is what put him off or what, you know, because he's about my age, meaning, you know, he's

56:31.889 --> 56:46.464
And I don't know whether the thought of being involved in that and having his name associated with such a venture put him off, whereas I intended that it'd be a carriage, you know, that he'd get from listening.

56:46.564 --> 56:52.730
Do you have any thoughts on these last books, you know, last book policies?

56:55.933 --> 57:01.879
You find libraries getting rid of books, and you wonder even if they're checking to see if there are copies in other

57:02.112 --> 57:03.934
I mean, it is possible to take a book.

57:04.094 --> 57:05.335
See, you don't do accession things.

57:05.415 --> 57:08.859
I mean, you have acknowledged some weeding.

57:09.359 --> 57:09.960
That happens.

57:11.902 --> 57:15.185
Or grooming, I guess, is a word that you hear used around here.

57:15.205 --> 57:19.930
Maybe if you have twenty copies of one book, you really don't need twenty of a book that nobody's using.

57:20.611 --> 57:23.534
Maybe you're going to get rid of fifteen or sixteen or seventeen of them.

57:23.654 --> 57:25.876
I mean, I'm sure that kind of thing happens.

57:26.117 --> 57:30.381
I'm just throwing numbers out.

57:30.833 --> 57:39.281
copies of Paul Samuelson's economics text from 1960 that you need to keep, you know.

57:39.301 --> 57:58.798
But I'm wondering, are you aware of this problem of books being deaccessioned from libraries and running the risk that this may be the last copy in existence, not the last copy in existence, but certainly the last one that we know of in a library?

57:59.268 --> 58:02.318
Is this something that you've talked about or considered or thought?

58:02.860 --> 58:07.675
One of the earliest... One of the earliest...
