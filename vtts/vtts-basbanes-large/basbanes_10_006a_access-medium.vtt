WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:06.119
900-odd words on the same.

00:06.460 --> 00:08.121
If you just tell me how you pronounce your name.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.504
Andras Riedlmasa.

00:10.724 --> 00:12.887
And what is that name?

00:12.947 --> 00:15.750
It's Hungarian.

00:15.770 --> 00:17.111
I'll give you a card, too.

00:19.994 --> 00:27.582
We're in your office at the Fine Arts Library, also known as the Fogg Museum, isn't that right?

00:27.783 --> 00:28.924
Yeah, it's in the Fogg Museum.

00:28.944 --> 00:29.845
It's in the Fogg Museum.

00:29.885 --> 00:30.966
Harvard University.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.387
And your job here, Doctor?

00:34.148 --> 00:36.071
Well, mystery is fine.

00:37.753 --> 00:38.374
I'm a librarian.

00:38.574 --> 00:39.676
I'm a bibliographer.

00:42.420 --> 00:52.313
And we're here to talk generally about the catastrophe at the

00:52.951 --> 00:57.056
And, you know, if this could be open-ended, why don't we just talk a little bit?

00:57.076 --> 01:00.820
I put on the machine because you were saying some interesting things, so I may as well get them on tape.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.681
All right.

01:01.701 --> 01:09.010
Well, I've been active on this subject now since late 1992.

01:09.790 --> 01:19.802
The greatest destruction of libraries took place in the first two years of the war, in 1992-93.

01:20.896 --> 01:31.374
And the National Library in Sarajevo was nearly one of a number of libraries that was destroyed in the war.

01:31.434 --> 01:37.965
In most cases, these were places that were deliberately targeted.

01:37.985 --> 01:44.777
And I've talked to people involved with the war crimes tribunals.

01:45.618 --> 01:55.441
They say the way they can determine deliberateness of targeting is by the pattern of shell impacts.

01:55.461 --> 02:03.981
If you have a shell falling here, another there, you can pretty much conclude that it is random shelling.

02:04.366 --> 02:16.138
If, however, you have a shell falling behind the building, in front of the building, and then 10 shells falling right on the building, then you know just from the targeting pattern that they meant to hit it.

02:17.279 --> 02:28.271
And while the UN was never any good at protecting anybody, civilians or property, they were very good at recording and observing what was happening.

02:29.572 --> 02:32.635
And in case of the National Library, in the case

02:33.458 --> 02:42.292
of several other libraries like the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo, which is probably the biggest loss in terms of manuscript materials.

02:43.454 --> 02:48.562
We're talking close to 6,000 bound manuscripts, over 200,000 historical documents.

02:49.784 --> 02:57.576
That was hit on May 17th of 92, the National Library some months later on August 25th of 92.

02:58.096 --> 03:06.545
Apparently there is an international effort afoot to try and... Well, I wouldn't dignify it as such.

03:07.205 --> 03:22.281
If you look up the article in yesterday's New York Times, you'll find that the National Library points out that now four years after the event, they've had a lot of promises.

03:23.915 --> 03:27.999
but very little in terms of firm commitments of money.

03:28.059 --> 03:51.323
Rector of Bosnia's National Museum Library, who's now Assistant Minister of Education in charge of rebuilding, told me that he was so sick of yet another needs assessment conference that he is now refusing to attend anymore.

03:51.556 --> 04:21.208
In the case of the National Library, for example, UNESCO has done so far, I believe, five international conferences convened at great expense, held in Prague, in Paris, and elsewhere, where people come and say, oh yes, the library needs to be rebuilt, and come up with some obvious and some sensible proposals.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.785
But there's never any funding forthcoming.

04:24.827 --> 04:36.827
UNESCO, at various points, sent in delegations of experts who come and take a look at the ruined buildings and say, yes, you will have to put a roof on this place before you put books in it.

04:37.709 --> 04:40.573
But no money comes out of it.

04:42.917 --> 04:46.403
The director general of UNESCO, Federico Mayor,

04:47.260 --> 05:03.059
took a much publicized trip into Sarajevo two years after the destruction of the library and flew in with a symbolic gift of about 200 books donated by Altalia.

05:03.639 --> 05:06.803
Those are the only books that UNESCO has ever delivered.

05:06.843 --> 05:15.293
This is a multi-million dollar organization and they've got lots of staff sitting

05:15.695 --> 05:19.360
in their Paris headquarters assessing.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.505
Why is it so pathetically woeful, do you think?

05:24.788 --> 05:39.469
First of all, I think the international library community and the intellectual community, people who supposedly care about culture and books, simply refuse to acknowledge what has taken place.

05:41.812 --> 05:45.077
I think if we faced it squarely, we would be faced

05:45.682 --> 05:49.869
with a need to do something about it, so it's easier simply not to think about it.

05:50.310 --> 05:56.961
When you say they refuse to acknowledge what has taken place, you mean beyond the actual destruction, but the intent.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.287
What you used the other day was the attack on memories.

06:00.768 --> 06:01.308
Exactly.

06:01.369 --> 06:08.000
What the purpose here was was not merely to destroy a building and its contents.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.706
This was much more than a casualty of war.

06:12.023 --> 06:16.047
Exactly.

06:16.067 --> 06:28.859
Well, there has been a deliberate campaign in Sarajevo and Mostar and other cities to attack highly charged symbolic objects, first of all.

06:28.879 --> 06:38.969
This means things like houses of worship, the Mostar Bridge, historic buildings, and on another level to attack archives and libraries.

06:40.050 --> 06:40.731
In the case of

06:41.015 --> 06:45.522
destroying records, you're pursuing a multiple purpose.

06:46.043 --> 06:56.740
Number one, in the case of communities, you destroy things that give a focus to the community, that preserve its collective memory.

06:56.780 --> 07:05.414
By attacking these, you're helping to terrify the inhabitants, break up the community, help drive people out in places that are overrun.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.377
You also

07:09.280 --> 07:17.109
ensure that in the long run, if you drive out people and you burned the records, there will be less reason for people to come back.

07:19.091 --> 07:37.532
You know, the things that enshrine a community's past, the birth records, land ownership records, the literary records, all of these are things that you don't want to preserve if your goal is to transform the landscape, ethnically speaking.

07:38.947 --> 08:06.608
then in an ideological sense, what moves these ideologies of national and ethnic purity, of which we unfortunately have a resurgence even in this country with all this xenophobia against immigrants and attacks on the notion that languages other than English ought to be spoken, etc.,

08:07.533 --> 08:17.804
you have this notion that people cannot, in fact, live together if they are not all the same, if they are not all of one faith, one language, etc.

08:19.185 --> 08:23.510
The problem is that the world, in reality, has never been like that.

08:24.891 --> 08:34.401
In the case of a country like Bosnia, almost everybody speaks the same language, but since about a thousand years ago,

08:34.972 --> 08:41.943
people have followed different faiths and religious traditions and have managed to coexist with each other.

08:42.023 --> 08:43.806
The common language is what?

08:43.826 --> 08:46.410
Well, the common language depends on who you talk to.

08:46.430 --> 08:49.916
It's called Serbo-Croatian or Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian.

08:49.956 --> 08:53.682
These are all typen Serbo-Croatian, Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian.

08:53.862 --> 09:01.975
Yeah, and dialectically they're not much more different than varieties of English.

09:02.410 --> 09:07.895
They have tended over the centuries to be written in different alphabets.

09:07.955 --> 09:13.300
Eastern Orthodox tradition prefers the Cyrillic script.

09:13.380 --> 09:21.367
The Latin tradition, you know, the Catholics tend to write in Latin alphabet, but it's the same dialect and the same language.

09:21.467 --> 09:32.417
I mean, you cannot, from speaking to somebody from Sarajevo, tell whether he or she is a Croat, a Serb, or a Muslim.

09:32.785 --> 09:47.828
And the religious classification in the last decade of the 20th century is pretty notional as well, because a very small minority of people consider themselves believers, let alone religiously observant.

09:48.809 --> 09:57.983
So we're talking about an identity that is probably as divorced from religion as, say, that of most American Jews vis-a-vis their identity.

09:58.385 --> 10:03.412
They're secure in their identification of Jews, but most of them will never see the inside of a synagogue.

10:04.713 --> 10:17.970
And similarly, you find in Bosnia many people who will say, of course, I am a Muslim or a Serb or a Croat, but it doesn't mean that they ever go to a place of worship other than for a funeral.

10:18.231 --> 10:21.775
Have you been to visit the site since the destruction?

10:21.795 --> 10:23.017
Not since the destruction.

10:23.097 --> 10:25.320
I was there before the war.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.672
And are you a native of that region?

10:27.692 --> 10:28.313
No, I'm not.

10:28.693 --> 10:30.695
I'm from Hungary, which is two countries over.

10:30.735 --> 10:31.937
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:31.957 --> 10:32.737
You did say that.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.418
I'm sorry.

10:33.438 --> 10:35.721
Yeah, Europe is a complicated place.

10:37.002 --> 10:43.489
And certainly the boundary lines have changed, you know.

10:45.171 --> 10:49.055
So tell me about your own involvement in this.

10:49.095 --> 10:51.898
Okay, well, I can tell you a little bit about it.

10:53.465 --> 11:07.081
Before we get to that, perhaps let's put in, you mentioned how this is part of a systematic destruction of the people, the symbol, and are there any modern parallels or even historic parallels that you can have?

11:07.101 --> 11:08.583
There are modern parallels.

11:09.124 --> 11:22.780
For example, in the 1930s, the earliest stages of the persecutions of the Jews in Hitler's Germany were the systematic attacks on synagogues and Jewish institutions, Kristallnacht,

11:23.468 --> 11:24.089
Germany.

11:25.069 --> 11:27.592
And it was very much the same kind of notion.

11:27.652 --> 11:40.864
In the 30s, I don't think, you know, Auschwitz had been thought of yet, but the notion was to get rid of every sign of a Jewish presence and thereby to terrify the Jewish community into leaving.

11:41.024 --> 11:52.395
Much of the 1930s was the desperate seeking of refuge by Jews who were being methodically excluded from society in Hitler's Germany.

11:53.995 --> 11:59.141
And the few countries that did accept the refugees benefited greatly thereby.

11:59.161 --> 12:09.492
I mean, for example, in Turkey, the whole modern educational system was formed in the 30s and 40s by refugees from Germany.

12:09.752 --> 12:13.216
I think I mentioned to you my interest in this aspect for this book.

12:14.797 --> 12:21.825
And it's been suggested that Harvard, for instance, that...

12:22.109 --> 12:23.491
That's an extraordinary statement.

12:23.511 --> 12:27.437
I think you more or less corroborated it, didn't you?

12:27.477 --> 12:29.941
In what respect would you corroborate?

12:29.961 --> 12:49.652
I mean, are you aware of how these books... I don't mean to jump around, by the way, but if you don't mind, if you have any thoughts on that, on how materials managed to move from... Especially for people of a certain contemporary education.

12:49.835 --> 12:54.300
books were the possessions they were least willing to part with.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.561
Least willing?

12:55.581 --> 12:56.122
Least willing.

12:56.202 --> 13:17.884
I mean, they couldn't take their cars and their houses, and it made no sense to take their clothes, but many of the people who fled Hitler's Germany were educated people, professional people, academics, people who may have been businessmen but had real feeling for culture and letters, and

13:18.438 --> 13:29.688
Very often, the things that they wanted to hang on to at all costs were their books, and in the case of art collections, their art, if they could take it out.

13:30.809 --> 13:39.697
And you find, indeed, that people who left everything else behind will have at least brought one suitcase of books.

13:39.718 --> 13:47.905
The link to Bosnia is sort of interesting because, again, talking to Kemal Vakasic, who is the former director of the National Museum

13:48.155 --> 13:50.938
And he wrote a piece about this, didn't he?

13:50.958 --> 13:51.859
Yeah.

13:51.879 --> 13:52.440
I'm sorry.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.401
Yeah.

13:53.421 --> 13:53.881
Go ahead.

13:53.901 --> 14:05.914
Where he and I have been corresponding via email, and he was telling me at one point that during the siege, for four winters, they had no fuel.

14:07.316 --> 14:09.338
And, you know, first they burned all the furniture.

14:09.398 --> 14:15.124
Then they tried burning clothes, but that didn't really work very well.

14:16.032 --> 14:23.343
Eventually, they got down to the point where they had to burn books to cook their miserable food.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.065
Did he burn books?

14:25.085 --> 14:25.326
Yes.

14:26.467 --> 14:28.911
Initially, he said it was very easy.

14:28.951 --> 14:39.266
Anybody has books in their house that they have no use for, old phone books, your high school chemistry textbook.

14:39.526 --> 14:40.808
No, no, wait.

14:41.547 --> 14:52.726
And then anybody who was educated in the communist era probably has the collected works of Marx and Lenin, et cetera, that they have to purchase and which they feel no qualms.

14:54.108 --> 14:57.274
Then eventually you get down to reference books.

14:57.294 --> 14:59.137
You figure they get outdated anyway.

15:01.781 --> 15:06.289
You build a real skill on how to make a book burn well.

15:07.028 --> 15:12.256
You form the pages in a certain way so it doesn't smolder, but gives you a nice... Yes.

15:13.118 --> 15:14.640
I don't have it, unfortunately.

15:15.361 --> 15:16.664
Maybe it's up before.

15:16.684 --> 15:19.448
Let's remember that you should give me his email address, by the way.

15:19.929 --> 15:27.401
And he says, but then the point comes when you've run out of the things that are easy, and he says, you really have to start making decisions.

15:27.481 --> 15:28.443
Do I take this one?

15:28.763 --> 15:29.745
They're not a choice.

15:29.765 --> 15:34.352
I mean, if you're starving and all you have is beans, you can't eat beans uncooked.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.745
any degrees outside, and it's winter.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.348
And you don't want to freeze to death.

15:39.368 --> 15:40.570
And you don't want to freeze to death.

15:41.030 --> 15:43.374
So, on one hand, you have your favorite book of poems.

15:44.054 --> 15:47.179
On the other, a novel you've read, but you want a treasure.

15:47.199 --> 15:51.165
You have to figure out which one to burn.

15:51.185 --> 15:52.106
Does he speak English?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.107
Oh, yeah, excellent.

15:53.348 --> 15:55.250
So, I mean, I could correspond with him?

15:55.311 --> 15:57.474
Oh, yeah, very much so.

15:57.834 --> 16:01.960
Should you make an introduction for me, or should I just write him off the top?

16:02.328 --> 16:05.933
You can mention my name, or I can write to him and mention that you're interested.

16:06.474 --> 16:09.438
I'd love to begin a correspondence with him.

16:09.458 --> 16:10.640
Yeah, he's a fascinating guy.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.202
But I'd like to go there, by the way.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.387
I'm hopeful that you can assist me in... Oh, sure.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.870
I can tell you somebody who just went there.

16:18.111 --> 16:18.451
Okay.

16:19.232 --> 16:24.440
So, a lot of people had to do this, and it really broke their heart.

16:25.722 --> 16:26.964
It goes against the grain.

16:27.044 --> 16:31.390
And as I say, you first learn books that you don't really consider books.

16:32.855 --> 16:37.504
And then you burn books, which you acknowledge are books, but you don't really value very much.

16:38.085 --> 16:40.029
And then you come to that point later.

16:40.289 --> 16:41.031
He says he did.

16:41.051 --> 16:48.906
I have two pictures of him, one taken one year into the war and one recently.

16:49.510 --> 16:57.477
He's a relatively young guy, he's in his 30s, and he looks like... He's married to a... He's a Muslim, right?

16:57.617 --> 16:57.878
Yeah.

16:58.018 --> 17:07.566
And I think his wife is... Although it's interesting, in his article it says, I'm a Muslim by heritage, but I'm really an atheist.

17:08.667 --> 17:09.048
Yeah, okay.

17:09.288 --> 17:10.249
I'm a computer man.

17:10.289 --> 17:12.211
His wife is a pro-op background.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.115
He's a librarian.

17:17.175 --> 17:18.376
Of course.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.197
And...

17:20.459 --> 17:25.846
And she teaches at Sarajevo University.

17:25.886 --> 17:35.179
He's currently the Assistant Minister of Education, but he figures after the September elections there'll be a new government.

17:35.219 --> 17:36.741
He doesn't want to be in politics.

17:37.001 --> 17:40.186
He was sort of drafted into this because of wartime conditions.

17:41.507 --> 17:50.179
So even though he's gotten big-money offers from the World Bank, he wants to go back to...

17:51.391 --> 17:55.897
He teaches at the library school at the University of Sarajevo.

17:55.997 --> 17:58.020
How did you make his acquaintance?

17:58.380 --> 18:03.667
Through an editor in New York who published both of us in The New Combat.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.289
What is The New Combat?

18:05.369 --> 18:10.616
The New Combat is the brainchild of a gentleman named William Ney.

18:12.578 --> 18:15.662
N-E-Y, but it's pronounced as if it were the other way around.

18:16.644 --> 18:19.187
And he's a young guy.

18:20.365 --> 18:31.154
Named it in honor of Le Combat, which appeared during the Resistance era in France by all—one of the early editors was Camus.

18:32.716 --> 18:35.658
And it was in the Journal of Reason and Resistance.

18:35.678 --> 18:38.361
It comes out rather irregularly, I think.

18:38.401 --> 18:39.722
He's on his fourth issue.

18:41.043 --> 18:44.366
And it deals with human rights around the globe.

18:44.586 --> 18:48.630
And he had a special issue on the war in the form of Yugoslavia in the fall of 94.

18:48.650 --> 18:50.271
Maybe I can get a copy of that for you.

18:50.757 --> 18:54.421
Yeah, yeah, I can give you his address.

18:54.781 --> 18:58.945
New Combat, A Journal of Reason and Resistance.

19:00.086 --> 19:01.428
So, you both did a piece?

19:01.648 --> 19:06.172
And, you know, so he says, do you know this guy?

19:06.253 --> 19:10.317
I said no, and he says, well, one thing led to another.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.240
So, it's all email correspondence?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.641
Yeah, I've never met him in person.

19:14.781 --> 19:18.705
But, I mean, do you write actual letters, or are they email letters?

19:18.955 --> 19:21.318
People treat email in different ways.

19:21.758 --> 19:32.710
A lot of people dash off email letters the minute they've received something, and they never read carefully what came in in the first place.

19:32.730 --> 19:37.715
They scan it, and then they sort of, off the top of their head, respond.

19:39.577 --> 19:46.144
Sort of the electronic equivalent of a spontaneous phone call.

19:47.525 --> 19:54.314
Other people, myself included, treat email like a treat real mail, meaning I read it.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.217
Sometimes I don't respond right away.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.141
I sleep on it, deal with it when I have time.

20:00.782 --> 20:04.467
And then when I write my response, I proofread it.

20:04.687 --> 20:05.348
You take care.

20:05.708 --> 20:09.753
I do with a real letter.

20:09.773 --> 20:16.502
And actually what bothers me is when I can tell from the response that the recipient hasn't read it like he would a real letter.

20:17.478 --> 20:20.061
But this is how you've corresponded with this gentleman?

20:20.101 --> 20:22.124
Yeah, we haven't done it very frequently.

20:22.164 --> 20:27.650
He's a very busy guy, but I think he's a great guy.

20:29.352 --> 20:33.537
I personally met the director of Bosnia's National Library.

20:33.617 --> 20:36.060
He was in Boston in 1994.

20:37.842 --> 20:45.932
Some colleagues at the University of Michigan, through UNESCO, arranged for him to come out of Sarajevo

20:46.874 --> 20:54.825
And he toured some North American libraries and stayed with my colleague, Jesper, just a block away from him.

20:54.845 --> 20:56.668
You haven't been since the destruction.

20:56.728 --> 20:57.849
What do you think you'd see?

20:58.791 --> 21:02.215
I've talked to people who've been there recently.

21:02.235 --> 21:04.899
On a trip for me, what would be the great benefit?

21:04.979 --> 21:06.521
What would I learn that I couldn't?

21:06.642 --> 21:09.165
Oh, you would learn a great deal, I think.

21:09.225 --> 21:14.873
First of all, anybody who goes there is impressed by the

21:15.308 --> 21:17.291
pervasiveness of the destruction.

21:17.471 --> 21:19.374
I mean, virtually every building.

21:19.414 --> 21:21.437
You mean in the city?

21:21.678 --> 21:23.200
In the city, yeah.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.043
And you can see how it's concentrated.

21:25.063 --> 21:37.182
I mean, the Oriental Institute, for example, the Oriental Institute constituted the top two stories of a hundred-year-old office building.

21:37.202 --> 21:39.325
It was built back under the Habsburgs.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.487
and it's in a dense neighborhood.

21:42.507 --> 21:46.370
None of the neighboring buildings are particularly badly shot up.

21:46.570 --> 21:51.715
This one is completely gutted the top two floors.

22:01.883 --> 22:06.327
During the war, there was an incredible market for books.

22:06.828 --> 22:09.750
There were basically two sources of food.

22:10.321 --> 22:20.290
stand in line for the UN food rations, which often exposed you to danger because the food lines were particular targets.

22:22.492 --> 22:28.097
Or if you wanted things other than beans and rice, you could deal on the black market.

22:29.398 --> 22:34.783
And people would often spend the equivalent of a week's food rations just to buy books.

22:35.384 --> 22:39.788
There were over 200 titles published in the first three years of the war.

22:39.953 --> 22:44.959
in Sarajevo, mostly in very small press runs because they didn't have a lot of paper.

22:45.659 --> 22:48.703
But people had a real need for it.

22:48.763 --> 22:49.544
Was it literature?

22:49.624 --> 22:50.325
Was it history?

22:50.365 --> 22:51.146
Was it a mix?

22:51.286 --> 22:52.007
It was a mix.

22:52.067 --> 22:54.349
There were volumes of poetry printed.

22:54.369 --> 22:55.931
I have some translations.

22:55.951 --> 22:56.592
New things?

22:56.952 --> 22:57.453
New things.

22:58.854 --> 23:00.056
There were memoirs.

23:00.436 --> 23:04.220
There was the usual political-cultural stuff, current stuff.

23:05.442 --> 23:08.425
In many cases, people explained to me

23:09.029 --> 23:18.601
You know, you spend week after week cowering in a stairway or in a basement, and you can't really do your everyday activity.

23:19.662 --> 23:26.831
And to prove that you're not just an animal struggling for survival, intellectual activity is what remains.

23:26.911 --> 23:33.319
It's the same sort of principle that causes people to write poetry in prison.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.603
Is there a formal name for this war?

23:36.743 --> 23:38.445
Is there a name for this war?

23:38.746 --> 23:40.768
A lot of people call it various things.

23:41.849 --> 23:45.173
The war in Bosnia is what a lot of people call it.

23:45.193 --> 23:53.562
This is something that was put together in March of last year by the Open Society Institute, this Thesaurus Foundation.

23:54.463 --> 23:58.788
And it's just a list of various institutions and what they need.

23:59.589 --> 24:06.797
But the touching thing is in the back, the pictures of various institutions.

24:06.817 --> 24:07.858
I can show you some of them.

24:08.918 --> 24:11.501
This is the National Museum.

24:11.521 --> 24:13.223
That's a direct hit from a tank shell.

24:14.745 --> 24:19.852
You can see these old buildings tended to survive a lot better if they were built.

24:20.172 --> 24:21.353
That's the National Gallery.

24:22.895 --> 24:27.301
That's a 16th century library, the oldest in Sarajevo.

24:28.022 --> 24:30.565
That one I heard various stories about.

24:30.585 --> 24:34.690
One was that it was actually shelled

24:35.615 --> 24:44.886
And in May of 1992, it's the Ghazi Husrevbeg Library, was shelled in May of 92.

24:46.428 --> 25:00.625
And they had the presence of mind of the defenders of setting up some smoke grenades right in the entrance, after which the shelling stopped, because they figured they had set it on fire.

25:00.705 --> 25:04.069
And then when darkness fell, they evacuated the library successfully.

25:05.500 --> 25:10.026
So basically there was some damage, but they didn't lose any of that possible.

25:10.086 --> 25:18.338
There was a woman, I read, Diane Rilkes has a book of libraries, she has a paragraph in there, and there was a woman, apparently, in the library, who was killed.

25:18.358 --> 25:21.422
Yes, she's a sister of a friend of mine, actually.

25:21.442 --> 25:23.024
I mean, I will name her in this book.

25:23.084 --> 25:27.170
I mean, this to me is a, you know, a bookminer in many ways, isn't she?

25:27.330 --> 25:27.630
Yeah.

25:28.652 --> 25:32.197
Her name is Aida Buturovich.

25:32.397 --> 25:34.680
And it is, it's spelled in...

25:34.778 --> 25:36.160
Yeah, yeah.

25:36.660 --> 25:41.786
Aida Butorovic was, I believe, 23 or 24 years old.

25:41.866 --> 25:42.947
I can find out for you.

25:42.967 --> 25:44.329
Her sister lives in Toronto.

25:45.971 --> 25:50.716
And she was one of two sisters of an intellectual family.

25:50.796 --> 25:55.802
The father's a lawyer, the mother teaches at the conservatory.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.987
Both of the girls were university educated.

26:00.007 --> 26:04.532
And Aida was pursuing a PhD.

26:05.288 --> 26:10.776
in philology, but also working as a librarian in the National Library's exchange of sections.

26:12.158 --> 26:20.169
And kept on working during the war, even though it was dangerous to go to and from work.

26:21.611 --> 26:29.922
And then on the 25th of August, 92, she heard that the National Library was on fire.

26:30.883 --> 26:33.187
And she told her parents, the library's on fire.

26:33.207 --> 26:34.148
I've got to go now.

26:35.275 --> 26:41.323
And as they saw her, colleagues saw her at the burning library helping to evacuate folks.

26:42.364 --> 26:51.977
In mid-afternoon, she got tired after having worked all day and started home, and she hadn't gotten more than a block or two before she was murdered by a sniper.

26:53.039 --> 26:59.207
You've got to know that snipers look their victims in the face.

26:59.626 --> 27:01.329
These are random shots.

27:01.349 --> 27:05.575
These are targeted, perceived people.

27:05.695 --> 27:24.705
There are videos recorded of Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Republic of Srpska, standing up at a Serbian sniper position with a Russian visitor, pointing out how through the scope you can see everybody inviting the Russian to take a shot, and the Russian does.

27:24.725 --> 27:26.848
He does, to shoot somebody.

27:28.229 --> 27:32.413
Several reporters also have reports of being made the same offer.

27:32.473 --> 27:33.434
They say they refuse.

27:34.715 --> 27:36.576
Where are we going?

27:36.596 --> 27:36.756
Yeah.

27:36.837 --> 27:37.497
Where are we going?

27:37.517 --> 27:41.341
I mean, all wars have this kind of thing, but not to this degree.

27:42.181 --> 27:47.666
Anyway, the sad story about Aida is her parents, of course, got frantic when she didn't return.

27:47.686 --> 27:48.727
23 years old.

27:49.047 --> 27:54.052
And it's not that she had wanted to die or risk herself needlessly.

27:54.452 --> 27:56.734
She'd gotten engaged just a week before.

27:57.102 --> 27:58.344
to her long-time boyfriend.

28:00.026 --> 28:03.411
She was looking forward to life, but she felt that she needed to do this.

28:04.733 --> 28:07.337
Her parents identified her at the morgue the next day.

28:07.357 --> 28:24.983
Her father was absolutely crushed and started visiting his daughter's grave regularly and was killed by a shell blast less than a year later on his way to visit his daughter's grave.

28:25.688 --> 28:28.911
Their other daughter was outside of Bosnia.

28:29.331 --> 28:38.840
She had just left before the war broke out to pursue a PhD at McGill and now in Toronto.

28:38.860 --> 28:43.445
The destruction, as you pointed out, 1.5 million, approximately, books.

28:44.025 --> 28:51.212
It's, without a doubt, the largest single incident of deliberate book burning in modern history.

28:51.372 --> 28:55.476
There were several pre-modern book

28:55.962 --> 28:56.863
destructions.

28:57.064 --> 29:00.108
One was, of course, the Library of Alexandria.

29:00.969 --> 29:02.331
Which is arguable how that happened.

29:02.351 --> 29:05.576
Arguable how many times it was burned and what was in it.

29:06.197 --> 29:11.144
There's the Chinese emperor who ordered all the Buddhist scriptures destroyed.

29:11.164 --> 29:13.607
And again, who knows how many there were.

29:14.729 --> 29:23.421
In this case, there were between one and a half and two million items in the library.

29:24.413 --> 29:34.021
Now, once you get a library that size, it's hard to get an accurate item count, because a pamphlet and an encyclopedia are both items.

29:34.101 --> 29:42.468
But in any case, the number of books destroyed approaches one and a half million.

29:42.488 --> 29:43.389
But it's more than numbers.

29:43.409 --> 29:45.631
I mean, what's the population of this country?

29:45.911 --> 29:53.678
Four million people, and when the library was formed after World War II, it incorporated the

29:53.827 --> 29:56.410
collections of cultural societies.

29:56.430 --> 29:57.691
This is the central repository.

29:57.711 --> 30:04.459
And this was the central repository, so they had the country's most complete collection of everything published in Bosnia.

30:04.479 --> 30:19.817
When I asked the National Library what he missed most of all the things that got burned, he says, the stuff that will be impossible to replace, he said, are all the small literary journals, all the local periodicals from the early part of the century.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.082
which probably were preserved nowhere else.

30:22.102 --> 30:26.988
He said the big standard items, even the rare books, you can replicate.

30:27.950 --> 30:29.712
There will be copies of them elsewhere.

30:29.732 --> 30:30.734
And are they trying to do that?

30:30.754 --> 30:31.054
Oh, yes.

30:31.315 --> 30:33.558
That's a different story, and I'll tell you about it more.

30:33.678 --> 30:45.354
But he says, you know, the journals of small literary societies, the records of cultural associations, they had large archival collections as well.

30:46.015 --> 30:48.859
He says things like this.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.352
The library had over 100,000 different postcards.

30:57.899 --> 31:03.386
Musical scores, ephemera, theater posters, all of that went.

31:03.406 --> 31:09.754
And, of course, they know, in a general sense, what was lost, but I suspect— They lost their card catalog.

31:09.774 --> 31:18.846
They lost their documentation, so they really can't— Like most large libraries, they were in the middle of making plans for converting their catalog to electronic form.

31:19.535 --> 31:21.198
The war broke out in 1992.

31:21.218 --> 31:26.185
In 1989, they had begun to put online their new acquisitions.

31:27.948 --> 31:30.492
They hadn't yet begun to convert their older records.

31:30.752 --> 31:32.094
Which would take years.

31:32.194 --> 31:32.355
Decades.

31:32.375 --> 31:41.208
So they have about four years' worth of acquisitions for which they have electronic records, and beyond that, they can only guess.

31:41.288 --> 31:44.814
And they just are cruel teasers, really, of what they had anyway.

31:44.834 --> 31:48.259
In the other days, there's a record of what was there and which is now gone.

31:48.695 --> 32:09.879
Now, the ways in which they're working on this, Kema Obakash, the guy I mentioned to you, has started a journal called Bosniaca, which is devoted to substantive scholarly articles on reconstructing the country's literary heritage, which has been destroyed.

32:09.919 --> 32:15.445
And so the first issue has already appeared.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.042
That's one way.

32:17.183 --> 32:35.933
Another way is when the National Librarian was here and then subsequently he sent his head cataloger out, I took him to see the systems people at Harvard and they were very good.

32:35.993 --> 32:43.305
They gave over an hour of their time and we talked about various ways in which to do this and finally came up that

32:43.808 --> 32:58.048
In today's electronic age, we have a real possibility in that major American research libraries have very large portions of the printed record, at least, in various institutions.

32:58.669 --> 33:08.824
And most of these large research institutions are members of bibliographic utilities, OCLC, Arlen, these large cataloging consortia.

33:09.825 --> 33:11.908
OCLC, I know, what's the other one?

33:12.158 --> 33:13.440
R-L-I-N.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.703
It's the Research Library's Information Network.

33:16.344 --> 33:19.228
Arlen is based in Palo Alto.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.131
OCLC is based in Dublin, Ohio.

33:22.373 --> 33:23.134
This one is done.

33:23.815 --> 33:27.781
The project, the way it worked out is... I'm sorry, we're in California?

33:28.201 --> 33:28.742
Palo Alto.

33:28.762 --> 33:29.343
Palo Alto.

33:29.363 --> 33:30.164
Are we out there?

33:31.426 --> 33:37.795
Anyway, Arlen so far is not involved in any event, and it's the smaller of the two.

33:38.045 --> 33:42.992
OCLC is, however, as you know, quite big, and they also have a European operation.

33:44.254 --> 33:54.129
And a woman at Yale University, a librarian named Tanya Lorcovich, you can find her name in yesterday's New York Times article.

33:54.429 --> 33:56.552
Well, let me be able to copy that before I go into it.

33:57.574 --> 33:57.674
Sure.

33:57.694 --> 34:01.960
Anyway, Tanya contacted the librarians at Yale.

34:03.202 --> 34:07.208
I got the systems librarians here to contact others.

34:07.728 --> 34:14.436
And so the upshot was a meeting at that year's ALA meeting in the spring of 95.

34:14.896 --> 34:34.039
And as a result of which the president of Yale University Library and director of Harvard University Library wrote to the director of OCLC and proposed the project, which OCLC then agreed to do, of

34:35.285 --> 35:01.129
having bibliographers initially at Harvard, Yale, and Michigan, but ultimately to involve others, work out certain targeting criteria by place of imprint, subject words, authors' names, and so forth, to develop a master bibliography of things having to do with Bosniaca.

35:01.169 --> 35:02.811
The definition of Bosniaca

35:03.668 --> 35:16.161
B-O-S-N-I-C-A, is books either printed in Bosnia in any language on any subject, or books published elsewhere that deal with the subject of Bosnia.

35:16.542 --> 35:19.265
In other words, the things that a national library ought to have.

35:21.227 --> 35:32.038
And OCLC would take care of doing the searches, of having their research people refine them, and come up with a master list

35:33.537 --> 35:35.279
which would also include locations.

35:36.060 --> 35:42.209
This would be then made available to the Bosnians, who could then do the work of weeding duplicates.

35:42.289 --> 35:45.654
As you know, libraries catalog the same books, sometimes in different forms.

35:46.975 --> 35:54.305
And then from that, producing a subset of records for items they absolutely feel they must have.

35:55.807 --> 35:58.431
Now, in the case of most of the American libraries,

35:58.647 --> 36:06.840
they're involved in massive reformatting projects anyway, microfilming, scanning, disks, whatever.

36:06.880 --> 36:24.908
The trick then would be to contact one of the major microform vendors, there are several, IDC and others, and propose a project whereby they would photograph or scan

36:25.867 --> 36:29.232
the items on the list that the Bosnians then designate.

36:29.913 --> 36:42.433
The donor libraries would get sets for the things that they donated, thereby relieving them of the cost of having to do preservation microfilming in the first place.

36:42.894 --> 36:48.162
The Bosnians would get a set which would be their virtual national library collection.

36:49.475 --> 36:58.268
And the vendor could then market sets for other interested parties, and there would probably be enough of the commercial market out there to at least defray the cost.

36:58.848 --> 37:00.731
Has any of this transpired?

37:01.352 --> 37:10.425
The project was announced this February, and there was a small item on it in American libraries, I believe in the February issue.

37:11.987 --> 37:15.432
And I got the citation for you.

37:15.597 --> 37:25.667
I think for the moment, for OCLC, it's a fairly low-priority project, mainly because they're a commercial company.

37:25.687 --> 37:29.370
They're not making money on it, but it's a long-term undertaking.

37:29.731 --> 37:34.895
But it's good PR for them, and ultimately it's not going to be very costly for them.

37:35.736 --> 37:39.099
They have lots of excess data storage capacity anyway.

37:39.140 --> 37:42.803
It's mainly a question of staff time.

37:43.458 --> 37:45.982
As we all know, that's an elastic commodity.

37:46.022 --> 37:48.045
They were very good during the Bloomberg trial.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.169
I mean, they really contributed.

37:50.189 --> 37:51.030
No, no, they liked it.

37:51.050 --> 37:52.332
They did the videotape.

37:52.373 --> 38:09.280
You know, what I wish would happen is if we could get some higher profiling for this, which might attract, you know, a publisher or a government agency or a foundation to pour some money into it to get it moving faster.

38:10.002 --> 38:15.829
But at least you've got institutional commitments by some pretty major institutions like Harvard and Yale in Michigan.

38:16.710 --> 38:19.433
You've got OCLC, at least in theory, committed to this.

38:19.593 --> 38:22.216
And I think this holds a real possibility.

38:22.717 --> 38:34.430
And given that nowadays many people, even in Europe, do their cataloging through OCLC, it wouldn't be that hard for the Bosnians to do a system link.

38:35.772 --> 38:39.216
Well, how much of their history do you think is recoverable?

38:39.500 --> 38:41.242
It's hard to say.

38:41.262 --> 39:07.195
I mean, one glimpse of this, there was an American professor named Joel Halpern who lives in Amherst, an anthropologist who, while he was teaching at UCLA in the late 50s, got a grant to go to Bosnia and elsewhere in Yugoslavia and purchase books.

39:08.255 --> 39:26.743
This was only about a decade after the Tito takeover, and one of the first things that communist regimes generally did is to dissolve or take over all sort of independent cultural organizations, you know, from the Chamber of Commerce to culture clubs, etc.

39:27.524 --> 39:30.769
And usually the process would involve confiscating their libraries.

39:31.643 --> 39:42.480
In the cases of the really large organizations, the libraries were incorporated in national collection, but in many other cases they'd just be locked in a room and would be sold off at random.

39:43.441 --> 39:49.270
And Halpern was telling me back then he was running around and buying books by the kilo.

39:50.492 --> 39:55.440
And so he brought back over 50,000 items to UCLA.

39:56.467 --> 40:01.732
The stuff sat on process at UCLA for several decades.

40:03.374 --> 40:05.936
You know, most of it was small stuff, pamphlet-y stuff.

40:05.956 --> 40:09.080
It wasn't seen as important to help inscribe dismay.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.322
Some of it was arbitrarily even discarded.

40:12.863 --> 40:26.457
But there was renewed interest after the war broke out, and the commercial firm based in New York microfilmed the whole set and is now selling it for outrageous sums, several thousand dollars.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.833
to large research libraries that buy such things.

40:30.773 --> 40:36.398
Now, I've gotten Halpern to get in touch with the publisher to see if they would donate a set to the Bosnians.

40:36.499 --> 40:38.160
I can't see any reason why they wouldn't.

40:38.180 --> 40:39.802
The materials cost is minimal.

40:41.163 --> 40:44.185
So that's still... That's in negotiation.

40:44.806 --> 40:57.017
Now, the third item is my project, and if you want to come up to the computer, I can show you, which is to try to recover your project.

40:57.318 --> 40:58.440
Yeah.

40:58.460 --> 41:01.084
I mean, all these others I'm involved with in various ways.

41:01.906 --> 41:03.148
Can you grab a chair?

41:03.168 --> 41:03.268
Sure.

41:03.288 --> 41:04.590
Let me just put this here.

41:07.335 --> 41:07.435
Yeah.

41:07.455 --> 41:08.517
Name the project for me.

41:09.118 --> 41:09.558
Okay.

41:09.799 --> 41:17.431
It's called the Bosnian Manuscripts in-gathering project.

41:17.672 --> 41:22.600
My project was born out of a...

41:23.390 --> 41:27.696
discussion among three of us, and all three of us are involved, so it's our project, really.

41:27.736 --> 41:29.379
Bosnian manuscripts.

41:30.981 --> 41:32.283
In-gathering project.

41:32.944 --> 41:35.648
Let me get you to it.

41:35.668 --> 41:40.194
I went to the URL at the time, but I can show you a little bit more, and I can print you out.

41:40.214 --> 41:43.860
This is a faster printer, probably, than the one you've done.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.302
Come on, slip, look.

41:45.322 --> 41:50.950
Creating the destruction of memory, a call for an in-gathering of Bosnian manuscripts.

41:51.419 --> 41:52.560
Because I have a page here.

41:53.241 --> 41:54.963
A friend of mine.

41:55.384 --> 41:57.787
Actually, I supplied this.

41:57.847 --> 42:01.191
This is a Bosnian manuscript from the Middle Ages.

42:01.772 --> 42:09.101
I'm not sure if it's obvious, but the CD and the document together form a lowercase b, and shows the document emerging from the CD.

42:09.121 --> 42:11.163
That's wonderful.

42:11.183 --> 42:13.105
And this is the address you gave me, too.

42:13.206 --> 42:14.848
I can get into this.

42:15.248 --> 42:16.690
Yeah, so this is the address.

42:16.710 --> 42:20.194
And the general notion is

42:20.579 --> 42:41.982
We were talking, the first time I gave Bosnia talk, we were talking with the sister of the librarian who got killed, is an orientalist herself, and she'd worked at the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo, which as I told you is the largest manuscript library among many that were targeted in Bosnia.

42:43.243 --> 42:46.587
And as she and I were talking,

42:46.904 --> 43:11.338
It occurred to both of us that many of these institutions that were destroyed had a fairly high profile in the world of scholarship and had hosted many foreign scholars who had gone there to do research and presumably had gone back with copies of items they had studied, photographs, microfilms, notes they had taken.

43:11.438 --> 43:16.084
Sometimes they had published items.

43:16.317 --> 43:36.978
In the case at least of the Oriental Institute, they had been very active in pursuing exchanges, meaning let's say an institute in Berlin would designate X number of items that they were interested in and they would exchange for an equal number of items.

43:38.079 --> 43:43.945
And so when the institute was burned up in an attack in May of 92,

43:44.465 --> 43:50.111
Among the things that were destroyed were scores of cabinets of microfilms.

43:51.252 --> 44:03.005
And from this I conclude that an equal number of cabinets of microfilms exists scattered throughout Europe bearing some portion of what was irrecoverably lost.

44:04.787 --> 44:13.797
And so we designated this and we had no funding, no personnel, but we figured we could do it number one on the web.

44:14.097 --> 44:18.803
which wouldn't reach many of the target people, but would at least help publicize it.

44:19.323 --> 44:24.189
Number two, by publicizing it in scholarly journals of the appropriate fields.

44:25.251 --> 44:36.865
And number three, ultimately, and we haven't really gotten started on that, to track down people through citation analysis, just look who has published

44:37.739 --> 44:40.742
work based on original Bosnian materials.

44:41.023 --> 44:46.669
Track down scholars and write them letters saying, do you have in your study items?

44:47.690 --> 45:03.427
And the idea would be not to actually gather here in Harvard or in Toronto, where our other collaborator lives, actual copies of anything, but simply to compile a directory of where these copies of lost originals now reside.

45:04.788 --> 45:06.430
Present those to the Bosnians.

45:07.675 --> 45:20.831
The Oriental Institute is still together, and they then can either seek funding or approach these people themselves and say, can you let us have a copy, which we used to have and now you have a copy of.

45:20.851 --> 45:22.513
And you're compiling a record, too.

45:22.533 --> 45:23.475
You have a record here.

45:24.195 --> 45:25.297
It won't just be over there.

45:25.757 --> 45:28.381
Yeah, I mean, the record will reside all over the place.

45:28.421 --> 45:35.910
Anybody who gets to this home page can click on this interactive form.

45:39.063 --> 45:49.897
that document registration form, and simply enter into these things, which are all sort of infinitely expandable.

45:52.780 --> 46:08.901
Their address, the particulars on what they have, is it a microfilm, a microfiche, a photograph, etc., which reproduces the original in a whole or in part, what was the original...

46:10.231 --> 46:17.779
the title, the authors, the languages, the alphabets, basic publication data.

46:17.799 --> 46:24.627
If it's manuscript data, then you have things like the first few lines, last few lines.

46:25.788 --> 46:32.936
Anyway, and they fill it out, and it immediately comes to a database.

46:32.956 --> 46:33.457
And where?

46:33.477 --> 46:35.018
Who monitors this?

46:35.078 --> 46:40.204
The person who monitors it is my friend Dr. Irvin Schick, who works for BBN.

46:40.859 --> 46:44.444
Both Baranek and Newman here in Cambridge.

46:46.468 --> 46:47.890
He's sort of a renaissance man.

46:47.950 --> 47:01.230
He's a computer scientist, but has a PhD in mathematics, but also has humanistic interests, has written many articles on literary theory and various other things.

47:02.240 --> 47:05.023
So he's quite involved.

47:05.043 --> 47:07.205
So he's done the electronic wizardry for this.

47:07.365 --> 47:09.307
I can't claim credit for any of it.

47:09.327 --> 47:10.628
Oh, it's quite magnificent.

47:10.648 --> 47:12.750
Has it yielded much results?

47:12.850 --> 47:17.294
So far, this has been up less than a year so far.

47:18.315 --> 47:28.885
And in terms of actual items from Bosnia, we've had three major interactions.

47:29.666 --> 47:31.167
One was

47:31.653 --> 47:40.722
Stefano Carbone, who is an assistant curator of Islamic art at Metropolitan Museum, who actually came to one of my talks.

47:41.262 --> 47:46.828
And I talked at the Air College Art Association Conference in Boston this February.

47:47.909 --> 47:54.195
And as part of the talk, I showed slides, including one of the manuscripts from the Oriental Institute.

47:54.835 --> 47:57.778
And it came up very disturbed afterwards and said,

47:58.079 --> 48:00.341
Are you sure it's destroyed?

48:00.361 --> 48:01.963
I worked on that manuscript.

48:02.023 --> 48:02.944
It breaks my heart.

48:03.865 --> 48:08.791
I'd heard the Institute had been destroyed, but I'd hoped that at least some of the contents were saved.

48:08.851 --> 48:14.016
And I said, no, I have a fax from the director of the Institute saying that virtually everything is lost.

48:15.378 --> 48:23.226
And so I told him about this project, and not long afterwards, we got a message from him saying that...

48:23.763 --> 48:37.938
The manuscript in question was a 15th century Islamic astrological treatise, and half of the treatise was in Sarajevo, the other half in a private art collection in England.

48:38.999 --> 48:48.189
The owner of the private art collection in England had color photographs and a full microfilm of the Sarajevo portion of the manuscript.

48:48.229 --> 48:51.272
Wow, that's wonderful.

48:51.573 --> 48:59.886
At the moment, we've contacted the collector, and he will be sending copies to Sarajevo via a British diplomatic pouch.

48:59.946 --> 49:01.228
That's spectacular.

49:01.428 --> 49:04.273
So that has been the most spectacular.

49:04.613 --> 49:07.678
Do you remember, did you tell me the name of it, of what it was?

49:08.900 --> 49:10.442
It's an untitled manuscript.

49:10.463 --> 49:13.567
I can show you an article on it that he wrote.

49:13.748 --> 49:18.475
It's an astrological manuscript from 15th century.

49:20.345 --> 49:24.110
Another minor coup was through Professor Halpern.

49:25.091 --> 49:25.972
How do you spell Halpern?

49:25.992 --> 49:43.073
H-A-L-P-E-R-N, who back in the 1950s secured from the National Museum a set of photographs of Bosnian village architecture and village life, some of them taken from before World War II.

49:43.914 --> 49:46.757
And these wound up at the American Museum of Natural History.

49:47.412 --> 49:55.642
where, again, nobody's looked at them and they feel it's sort of outside their purview and weren't quite sure what to do with them.

49:55.662 --> 50:08.037
And so we've written them and they've sent us a full set of Xeroxes of it and are quite willing to share copies or maybe even the original with the Bosnians.

50:08.776 --> 50:11.886
So there have been a few along this... There was a third one?

50:11.906 --> 50:21.435
Yeah, there was a third item, which was a set of microfilms of archival documents, which we tracked down in Turkey.

50:22.850 --> 50:29.579
That, again, was not through the web, but through personal contact, but they supplied the particulars.

50:29.599 --> 50:34.566
That's a pretty daunting task, when you figure in a year you've gotten three, as wonderful as those three back.

50:34.586 --> 50:36.569
Well, the thing is, we haven't been working full-time.

50:36.589 --> 50:43.900
I also, subsequent to our starting this, found out that this is not a first.

50:44.601 --> 50:50.469
There have been at least two successful reconstitutions of libraries and archives in this century.

50:50.489 --> 50:50.629
Really?

50:51.284 --> 50:59.817
One was in World War I, where the library of the Catholic University in Louvain was burned down by the Nazis.

50:59.857 --> 51:04.564
I'm sorry, but I can print it out for you.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.027
I've got a little thing on it.

51:06.067 --> 51:08.230
That would be great.

51:10.893 --> 51:13.676
Anyway, L-O-U-V-A-I-N.

51:13.696 --> 51:14.617
Don't mind my asking.

51:14.677 --> 51:20.043
This was in 1914, August of 1914.

51:20.183 --> 51:40.444
On the very day, August 25th, 1914, which 80-odd years later was the date that the National Library in Sarajevo was burned down, the German army had rolled into Belgium at the beginning of World War I.

51:41.133 --> 51:43.175
Louvain was undefended.

51:46.239 --> 51:47.140
It's been done before.

51:47.160 --> 51:49.603
So you can just click there.

51:50.324 --> 51:57.993
And anyway, about a week after the Germans occupied the city, there was some shooting in the middle of the night.

51:59.375 --> 52:05.622
Recent scholarship inclines to the opinion that it was probably nervous German soldiers shooting at each other in the night.

52:06.260 --> 52:09.686
But at the time, the Germans didn't launch an investigation.

52:09.726 --> 52:11.989
They immediately decided on the reprisals.

52:12.530 --> 52:22.146
They shot 200 people in the city and then cordoned off the district where the shooting had taken place and methodically destroyed every building.

52:23.088 --> 52:31.862
It was an old Flemish cloth-making town, so they were very solid stone buildings, so each building had to be set afire individually.

52:32.787 --> 52:34.909
And at the center of it was the library.

52:35.490 --> 52:46.721
And German soldiers probably didn't even know it was the library, but, you know, they broke up in the basement and then rolled in some kerosene drums and set the place ablaze.

52:46.801 --> 52:48.383
It burned for many days.

52:48.523 --> 53:02.457
Anyway, even before the war was over, this aroused tremendous amount of outrage throughout the world, this being World War I.

53:04.225 --> 53:12.513
One of the first to call for a fund drive to rebuild the library at Levin was Harvard's president, Abbott Lawrence Lowell.

53:15.556 --> 53:18.359
And there were fund drives in all the neutral countries.

53:18.459 --> 53:19.240
Back then, the U.S.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.381
wasn't in the war yet.

53:20.401 --> 53:22.103
This was 1915.

53:24.385 --> 53:32.393
And after the war, the Americans were very much involved, and when Levin was finally rebuilt as a physical structure,

53:32.812 --> 53:40.785
The flags of all the American universities that had played an active part in the rebuilding were arrayed in the reading room.

53:41.266 --> 53:46.355
In terms of reconstituting the actual library, they pursued a very interesting technique.

53:46.896 --> 53:58.515
As in the case of Sarajevo, the catalog was lost, but they had large partial inventories that had been published and otherwise preserved.

54:00.048 --> 54:05.975
They established a trust fund into which some of the German reparation money went after the Treaty of Versailles.

54:06.496 --> 54:12.363
The income of the trust fund through the 1960s provided for the purchase of books for the Louvain Library.

54:12.403 --> 54:26.359
In addition, originally it was proposed that major German libraries go through their stocks of duplicate manuscripts and rare books.

54:27.267 --> 54:42.526
where you have more than one manuscript copy of something or more than one of incunabulum, and that they be compelled to give up an equal number in terms of number and rarity of what was destroyed at Levant.

54:42.546 --> 54:54.000
Eventually it was decided that this was not a practical way to proceed, and instead major book dealers were simply commissioned to buy books.

54:54.267 --> 54:58.452
This made the German librarians happier because they didn't have to give up their own books.

54:59.053 --> 55:05.140
And it provided tremendous stimulus for the book trade right after World War I because there were major sums involved.

55:05.820 --> 55:13.109
Also because there was tremendous inflation in Europe at the time and a lot of people had fallen on hard times.

55:13.129 --> 55:15.652
There were a lot of books coming on the market.

55:16.393 --> 55:19.296
And so Louvain's new collection was...

55:20.069 --> 55:21.591
Quite distinguished.

55:21.831 --> 55:26.015
Unfortunately, in World War II it was again destroyed.

55:26.415 --> 55:28.377
And again rebuilt.

55:29.799 --> 55:42.792
In the case of Naples, the most valuable portions of the state archives of Naples were evacuated from Naples in 1944 as the front line was coming closer in order to safeguard them.

55:43.192 --> 55:48.017
Now, ironically, the stuff that was left behind in Naples was never harmed.

55:48.520 --> 55:58.713
The stuff, however, that had been evacuated to a villa in the countryside fell afoul of a local German commander who burned their place down.

55:58.753 --> 56:08.746
And almost before the war was over, the Neapolitans were busy reconstituting the lost medieval archives of Naples.

56:09.287 --> 56:09.487
How?

56:10.007 --> 56:11.509
From crappies that were known to be?

56:11.710 --> 56:15.895
Well, the archives had been active since the 13th century.

56:16.668 --> 56:35.433
And since the 13th century, it had been used by various people, by genealogical researchers, by people who published scholarly articles from the 18th, 19th century onwards, by people who had taken manuscript notes, who had published portions of it, or who had photographs of it.

56:36.554 --> 56:40.399
And the publication project was begun right after the war.

56:41.481 --> 56:46.287
And as of last year, I think 44 volumes have been published.

56:47.093 --> 56:50.176
of the reconstituted archives.

56:51.918 --> 56:53.319
How did you find out about these things?

56:55.101 --> 57:03.830
Louvain, I happened to know about because I'd once read a book that had a reference to it, and I have one of these trash can mines, so I read in trivia.

57:04.130 --> 57:05.211
That's a good step.

57:05.231 --> 57:06.112
This is wonderful.

57:06.132 --> 57:17.083
In the case of the Naples archives, I hadn't known about it, but an archivist saw my website and told me about it.

57:18.464 --> 57:20.607
So let me print out some other stuff.

57:20.627 --> 57:21.989
If you don't mind, this is wonderful.

57:22.009 --> 57:32.264
You're saving me a lot of... As you know, you can... There's so much I can't possibly print it out for you, but you can print it all out.

57:32.324 --> 57:34.367
But there's a lot of stuff here.

57:35.469 --> 57:44.983
For example, here's a picture of the National Library when it was Rio that Drexel University helped produce for me.

57:45.904 --> 57:45.984
Wow.

57:46.004 --> 57:46.665
Library on fire.

57:48.603 --> 57:53.167
As it was burning on August 25th, almost the anniversary.

57:55.049 --> 58:01.675
Built in, actually, exactly a hundred years ago, 1896, it opened Sarajevo City Hall.

58:02.956 --> 58:08.542
And then after World War II, it was taken over to become the new National Library.

58:09.542 --> 58:15.488
Most of what they saved, in addition to the stuff, built right out of the burning building.

58:16.143 --> 58:20.168
were materials that were in remote storage that had run out of space.

58:22.091 --> 58:29.621
That's unfortunate because most of the stuff in remote storage is things in low demand because they weren't particularly interesting to anyone.

58:33.266 --> 58:37.332
The periodical titles were all in there.

58:38.593 --> 58:39.675
Look at the thing burn.

58:39.895 --> 58:40.235
That's amazing.

58:40.436 --> 58:42.539
What's left now is just a shell, right?

58:42.559 --> 58:44.361
I can show you what's left.

58:44.678 --> 58:52.613
