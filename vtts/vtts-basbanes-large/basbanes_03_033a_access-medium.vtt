WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:04.281
It does.

00:04.841 --> 00:06.543
Okay, we're now recording.

00:10.427 --> 00:18.575
I guess I'd like to start by just observing that your books are extraordinarily popular and bestsellers.

00:20.417 --> 00:27.644
And there is kind of a paradox where people suggest today that nobody reads the Bible anymore, that there's a form of biblical illiteracy.

00:27.744 --> 00:29.346
I wonder just

00:30.406 --> 00:31.387
Can you explain this?

00:31.647 --> 00:44.701
Is it a phenomenon, in your view, that writing so powerfully and directly about texts, which are not necessarily biblical texts, but certainly bear on the New Testament?

00:45.782 --> 00:46.824
How can you explain this?

00:47.124 --> 00:48.565
How do you explain this?

00:48.585 --> 00:52.249
Well, I suppose it's true that fewer people read the Bible than used to.

00:52.269 --> 00:57.595
I think that's true of our students, more than, say, for our generation.

00:59.279 --> 01:04.224
There's a tremendous interest in issues about religion and spirituality.

01:04.244 --> 01:12.313
And, you know, Tocqueville said this country is wildly religious, and I think that's still true.

01:12.613 --> 01:13.935
I mean, it's still to be the case.

01:13.955 --> 01:17.098
I'll just look at the presidential campaign and... Well, yes.

01:17.118 --> 01:17.739
Yes.

01:17.759 --> 01:19.681
I'm sorry, I have to run through that.

01:20.322 --> 01:21.002
No, it's true.

01:21.022 --> 01:29.151
But you think that you're bringing this... So it isn't just... I mean, a lot of people wouldn't say, read the Bible necessarily, but if you say...

01:30.093 --> 01:33.856
I mean, look at a book like The Da Vinci Code, which I can't read.

01:34.077 --> 01:36.078
Have you read the book?

01:36.239 --> 01:37.199
No, no, I looked at it.

01:39.021 --> 01:43.665
But what it says is that there's things left out of the tradition that we don't know about.

01:44.266 --> 01:44.987
And that is true.

01:45.687 --> 01:48.770
And that's what, of course, I write about.

01:48.790 --> 01:53.514
So that is also very intriguing to people, because it intuitively makes sense.

01:53.534 --> 01:57.698
And they sort of know that these books were chosen sometimes by somebody.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.880
I guess they sort of know it.

02:00.383 --> 02:07.453
many people stop their thinking about religion when they were five or six, you know, with whatever they learned when they were children.

02:07.473 --> 02:12.100
And at least in America, you know, they're not encouraged to think about it.

02:14.643 --> 02:16.466
Now, you've got these texts in the original?

02:18.709 --> 02:19.350
When I can.

02:19.690 --> 02:25.699
As they are transmitted to us, or even if you don't read the actual artifact, you're reading from

02:28.227 --> 02:29.168
You're not relying.

02:29.308 --> 02:29.769
There you go.

02:30.009 --> 02:30.890
Absolutely.

02:30.930 --> 02:31.791
Hoptic.

02:31.811 --> 02:32.912
Hoptic.

02:32.932 --> 02:34.554
Which is a language of yours.

02:34.974 --> 02:39.119
Seven, I think, that you've... Well, it's a language that I struggle with.

02:40.220 --> 02:45.766
It's an African language related to Punic and Berber.

02:45.786 --> 02:49.130
And, um, however... What was the other one?

02:49.150 --> 02:49.490
Berber.

02:49.510 --> 02:50.511
Berber, okay.

02:50.531 --> 02:53.435
It's an ancient African language.

02:53.455 --> 02:55.737
However, there's much of it here that

02:55.953 --> 03:12.414
So, you know, this is translated from Greek, and Greek is much more familiar to me or to anybody who knows ancient languages.

03:12.555 --> 03:13.256
Coptic is very hard.

03:14.577 --> 03:15.979
I don't claim to read it well.

03:16.079 --> 03:20.245
I just struggle through it like anybody who tries to read it.

03:20.285 --> 03:25.892
The tentative title of my work in progress is Every Book is Reader.

03:26.058 --> 03:36.831
I am interested in the original readers of texts, including the intended readership.

03:36.851 --> 03:41.776
Oh, well, these texts were probably hidden.

03:42.577 --> 03:45.321
Well, they were found near an ancient monastery.

03:45.341 --> 03:48.384
They were probably copied by monks.

03:48.544 --> 03:55.913
They're copied by somebody who put in the beginning of Codex I

03:56.703 --> 03:59.327
of prayer attributed to the Apostle Paul.

03:59.347 --> 04:05.536
And the prayer is for understanding and for insight and for wisdom and inspiration.

04:05.877 --> 04:17.534
And so these are written and copied and loved and read by Coptic monks in about the year 320, maybe?

04:17.554 --> 04:18.997
In the fourth century, to be sure.

04:19.017 --> 04:19.537
Probably.

04:20.419 --> 04:25.967
And they were there in the library when the archbishop sent an order telling the monks to get rid of them.

04:26.555 --> 04:28.638
To get rid of them, or to hide them, do you think?

04:28.658 --> 04:39.071
No, not to hide them, to destroy them, and never, because they lead people astray, and they seduce them, and they deceive them.

04:39.091 --> 04:46.902
So the battle had been won or lost, depending on your point of view as being put forth.

04:47.683 --> 04:56.494
The battle was joined very early, at least we know, when Irenaeus was writing his five volumes against the heretics in about 160.

04:57.183 --> 05:04.514
and saying, you know, the heretics say they have more Gospels than they really are, but they really don't have any that are not full of blasphemy.

05:04.534 --> 05:12.546
And then he talks about illegitimate secret texts, illegitimate bastard texts.

05:12.566 --> 05:12.947
Bastard texts.

05:13.007 --> 05:15.470
He calls these people the evil interpreters, I guess.

05:15.491 --> 05:15.671
Right.

05:16.472 --> 05:25.806
And they write all of these sort of apocalypsi, which means secret claims about secret writing, or apocryphoi, which means hidden things.

05:26.528 --> 05:33.379
And so they write these terrible things, and these are blasphemous and awful, and basically authored by Satan himself.

05:33.439 --> 05:52.890
So, you know, that's where we see at least the battle joined in the late second century, and then about 200 years later, the archbishop in a newly Christian empire was able to say, and I want you to destroy all of those, because those are bad.

05:53.360 --> 05:58.846
and keep the twenty-six that we call the springs of salvation, which are in the New Testament.

05:58.866 --> 06:01.749
So who do you think these people were that buried and meant to ask?

06:01.769 --> 06:02.670
I think they were monks.

06:03.932 --> 06:06.334
They were monks from the monastery who disobeyed the order.

06:06.394 --> 06:08.957
Maybe they had participated in copying.

06:08.977 --> 06:16.726
I mean, copying was very hard, long labor, and they didn't want to destroy all of these precious debts.

06:16.746 --> 06:18.387
And they were precious to the monks.

06:18.407 --> 06:18.928
Oh, certainly.

06:19.195 --> 06:20.940
I mean, you don't copy a text.

06:21.060 --> 06:21.742
It's not precious.

06:21.782 --> 06:33.895
But I mean, if the order comes down that these are now evil and blasphemous and heretical, whatever, they should be destroyed, you have people who are, in a way, rebelling against the authority of their... No doubt.

06:33.915 --> 06:34.757
...of their security.

06:35.142 --> 06:35.763
Sure.

06:35.823 --> 06:37.365
So the battle continues, in a way.

06:37.585 --> 06:39.928
Not the battle, but the opposition, the asylum.

06:39.948 --> 06:40.189
Right.

06:40.509 --> 06:41.771
Oh, it did, yes.

06:42.051 --> 06:45.636
And here they are found in 19, discovered in 1945.

06:45.836 --> 06:49.060
It's amazing what the power of this suppression is.

06:49.160 --> 07:00.155
I mean, for example, I have a colleague who studies the Dead Sea Scrolls, an Israeli, and she said, you know, if it hadn't been for the Dead Sea Scrolls, you'd think that Judaism is basically rabbinic.

07:00.175 --> 07:02.618
It's all this rabbinic stuff about, you know,

07:02.986 --> 07:12.196
how far you can walk on Shabbat, and what you can eat and what you can't eat, and sexual laws about intercourse after menstruation.

07:12.236 --> 07:15.139
I mean, this kind of thing, you know?

07:15.799 --> 07:32.757
You would not know that there's wild, mystical hymns, and strange apocryphal writings about joining the angels in the final battle of the universe, and things that really only turned up in what came to be Christianity.

07:33.445 --> 07:51.331
I mean, crazy stuff from a Jewish point of view, because many representatives of Jewish tradition and scholars of Judaism wanted to say, well, of course, our tradition may look barbaric to some of you, as it did to the Romans, because of circumcision and other strange practices.

07:51.351 --> 07:57.320
But in fact, it's very rational, it's very ethical, and it's really the best of all traditions, the most philosophic.

07:57.340 --> 08:02.608
So they didn't want mystical nonsense garbled

08:02.977 --> 08:12.165
you know, ecstatic speculation, things like that, or end-of-the-world talk, you know, this kind of thing.

08:12.265 --> 08:19.572
Many people thought that was just something that only very fringe groups would endorse, and Christians, you know, being among them.

08:20.493 --> 08:25.437
So, she said, if it weren't for the Dead Sea Scrolls, we'd think that everybody was a rabbinic type of Jew.

08:25.578 --> 08:28.320
And, in fact, there's a much wider range there than we ever knew.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.583
And, in fact, the Dead Sea Scrolls arrived totally unannounced.

08:32.373 --> 08:33.834
We did not know they existed.

08:33.854 --> 08:37.778
Now, you also point out that we knew that the Gnostics existed.

08:37.838 --> 08:39.520
We just didn't have the text.

08:39.540 --> 08:48.309
Well, we knew that there were people called holy ones who lived out in the desert and were particularly devout.

08:49.049 --> 08:51.452
But, you know, did we know they had a library?

08:51.492 --> 08:52.893
Not at all.

08:52.913 --> 09:01.722
So, you know, these are not the people of the rabbis' lives, and the people who wrote this are not the people.

09:02.174 --> 09:05.118
The Discourse on the Eighth and the Ninth.

09:05.219 --> 09:10.527
This is a dialogue of a father and his son.

09:10.787 --> 09:12.490
This means a teacher.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.574
Ava is a teacher.

09:15.915 --> 09:23.987
Talking about how one goes into the higher state of being and becomes enlightened in an ecstatic way.

09:24.207 --> 09:24.868
This discourse.

09:26.330 --> 09:27.372
It's quite wonderful.

09:27.757 --> 09:35.507
But it's not the kind of thing that Orthodox bishops wanted people doing, or trying.

09:35.547 --> 09:44.119
Pardon me if I jump around a little bit, but I have a question.

09:44.139 --> 09:45.000
No, no, it'll come back.

09:46.462 --> 09:53.351
I guess, really, again, who do you think that the original readers were meant to be, then, for these texts?

09:53.371 --> 09:56.515
Because you've also said that Christianity, using that word, was a

09:56.765 --> 09:59.689
was a number of competing movements, and we did not have one.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.772
Yes, like Judaism.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.394
Exactly.

10:03.654 --> 10:06.859
Or not even so—they might even be provincial, you know?

10:07.139 --> 10:14.369
It's not even so much competing—well, they were competing very often, but they were just lots of different kinds of groups, you know?

10:15.530 --> 10:17.193
And the audience—well, it's hard to know.

10:17.213 --> 10:24.983
I mean, these texts—monks, obviously, but also educated people, interested people, often

10:26.060 --> 10:31.307
people who were familiar with Plato and Plotinus and the works of philosophers.

10:31.327 --> 10:35.674
So this was as much an intellectual inquiry as it was a spiritual inquiry?

10:35.694 --> 10:49.073
Well, those were never divorced, and they weren't in the followers of Plato or the Platonic teacher, Plotinus, who was also caught up into states of contemplative mysticism.

10:49.093 --> 10:53.018
You know, these are some of the same groups.

10:53.098 --> 10:53.379
Exactly.

10:53.439 --> 10:55.662
We've broken them down.

10:56.435 --> 10:59.720
a lot more specifically in our time.

10:59.840 --> 11:19.387
You have a very interesting paragraph in Beyond Belief where you talk about those who are translating these texts 1,500 years after the fact into English, and how we're losing the sense of Jesus and the man who now has a special relationship with God, the vocabulary of Jesus.

11:19.407 --> 11:22.811
Oh, well, what I meant... And what I meant the role of the translator here and the interpreter.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.256
Well, what I meant, actually, that's the beginning of the Gospel of John.

11:26.489 --> 11:32.816
You know, and it says, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and He was in the beginning with God, and this and that.

11:32.836 --> 11:35.279
He came forth from the light.

11:35.299 --> 11:37.361
But then when you look at the Greek, you say, wait a minute.

11:37.621 --> 11:38.582
It doesn't say He.

11:38.602 --> 11:43.268
It says the Logos, the Word, came forth from the light.

11:43.748 --> 11:45.010
It.

11:45.030 --> 11:45.310
You know?

11:45.810 --> 11:49.915
But some translator is saying, well, this has got to be about Jesus, right?

11:50.175 --> 11:52.258
Because the Word is Jesus.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.420
Now, for a

11:55.835 --> 11:59.259
first or second century Jewish intellectual.

11:59.279 --> 12:02.003
The word might just be the divine word that was spoken in the beginning.

12:02.543 --> 12:11.935
Daniel Boyar, my colleague at the University of California, has written about this, that lots of Jews could use this kind of language, and they certainly wouldn't mean Jesus by it.

12:12.696 --> 12:21.847
But because the translator of what we call the Gospel of John knows it's got to be Jesus, Jesus is the whole point for the translator.

12:22.768 --> 12:24.610
So, you know, he takes

12:25.062 --> 12:38.646
I presume it's he, they usually were, who takes the term, which in Greek is about the word, and personalizes it and turns it into Jesus, the person, instead of the divine word.

12:39.006 --> 12:47.020
So that, anyway, there... And this is happening, we're talking now about the fourth century, or are we up into... Well, I was talking about, actually there, about

12:47.405 --> 12:49.587
the translators in the English, the King James.

12:49.607 --> 12:51.389
That's what I thought, yes, that's what I thought.

12:51.549 --> 12:51.890
Yeah.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.051
The King James translation.

12:53.071 --> 12:56.875
King James translation, when you take the Greek... 1610, 1611... Yeah.

12:57.055 --> 13:02.101
And not just the King James, but probably, I don't know, I haven't looked at the Luther Bible, but they're probably in German.

13:03.702 --> 13:04.303
I'm not sure.

13:04.343 --> 13:05.985
So is it the role of the translator?

13:06.225 --> 13:08.868
I mean, is the translator making a theological decision?

13:09.228 --> 13:09.468
Sure.

13:09.508 --> 13:10.630
Sure.

13:10.930 --> 13:13.673
I mean, it may not be the role, but it's unconscious.

13:13.853 --> 13:15.775
I mean, if the translator says, oh,

13:16.868 --> 13:22.634
Wouldn't it be almost a little, I hate to judge it, but it almost seems like it'd be a little more insidious than that, you know?

13:22.654 --> 13:30.442
It's not insidious, but deciding what this word means, there's almost an agenda at work here.

13:31.363 --> 13:36.789
There's an agenda, I think, you're right, but it's probably not even a conscious one, you know?

13:36.849 --> 13:39.252
It's not like, oh, I'm going to do this so it will sound like it.

13:39.752 --> 13:43.216
I mean, it's just assumed, you know?

13:43.236 --> 13:44.277
It's assumed, but when you talk

13:44.577 --> 13:48.883
The first three Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Jesus is a man.

13:50.325 --> 13:57.136
John, and then the battle is between John and Thomas, as you, who's going to go out here.

13:58.257 --> 14:03.425
And really, we are making the transition here to deity, it seems to be.

14:04.286 --> 14:05.027
Yes.

14:05.047 --> 14:05.127
Yes.

14:05.147 --> 14:10.175
I mean, John puts a poem at the beginning of the Gospel.

14:10.535 --> 14:13.740
And many people, many scholars think the poem predates

14:14.159 --> 14:24.415
So it would be an ancient Jewish poem about the divine word that God spoke in the beginning, and how light came forth from it, and it came into the world, and it's manifest, and so forth.

14:27.319 --> 14:29.182
The background of Jewish mysticism is that.

14:29.302 --> 14:34.130
But the translator's going to think, oh, this is the Gospel of John.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.774
Of course, this has got to be Jesus we're talking about.

14:36.794 --> 14:41.601
So it's not a conscious decision very often, particularly with these texts.

14:42.762 --> 14:46.467
You have people assuming that they know what it's about, you know?

14:46.487 --> 14:51.473
So when you approach these texts, do you come with any baggage at all?

14:51.493 --> 14:54.497
Or do you come with an open mind, shall we say?

14:54.537 --> 14:55.518
No, with lots of baggage.

14:55.618 --> 15:02.948
And the hard work is to unlearn things you think are obvious.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.771
You know, you think, well, of course that would be Jesus, wouldn't it?

15:06.732 --> 15:11.098
And, you know, lots of baggage, you know?

15:11.956 --> 15:20.445
Well, you just... You try to read it as naively as possible.

15:21.045 --> 15:21.966
Naively?

15:21.986 --> 15:22.187
Yeah.

15:22.767 --> 15:24.549
The word means open.

15:24.569 --> 15:28.093
So, you know, you try to say... Do you mind if I take a few pictures?

15:28.113 --> 15:28.393
No, it's okay.

15:28.413 --> 15:31.776
I mean, you try to think, well, what would a first century reader think of it, you know?

15:33.198 --> 15:37.422
Do you know the book of Revelation in the New Testament?

15:38.163 --> 15:40.225
Well, I have to confess I don't.

15:40.863 --> 15:57.202
I've been reading something by one of our graduate students, a book that he wrote, suggesting that it's not a Christian book and it's not about Jesus at all, but a divine figure appears who looks like a human being, and of course Christians would assume it's Jesus.

15:57.242 --> 15:57.903
Who else could it be?

15:59.665 --> 16:00.886
So that's what I mean.

16:01.427 --> 16:07.775
There's a huge amount of cultural baggage, but I think in the case of religious traditions, a lot of it is unconscious.

16:07.795 --> 16:10.718
One of your critics has suggested that you

16:11.339 --> 16:14.828
believe that perhaps the good stuff was left out of the button.

16:15.068 --> 16:16.632
Are you familiar with that review?

16:16.773 --> 16:18.657
Is that Luke Timothy Johnson?

16:18.677 --> 16:20.201
Yeah, it was cute.

16:20.221 --> 16:22.868
You know who he is?

16:23.405 --> 16:28.933
If I didn't know how polemical he can be in his other books, I would think it was a nasty review.

16:29.013 --> 16:30.214
Actually, he was rather soft on me.

16:30.234 --> 16:31.436
I thought it was pretty decent.

16:31.456 --> 16:33.419
It was rather soft on me for him.

16:33.759 --> 16:34.681
I don't know him like that.

16:34.701 --> 16:37.965
He's a very meek little man who writes the most vitriol.

16:38.185 --> 16:43.953
But he seems to have, certainly, you talk about bringing baggage to, bringing a point of view to a subject, he seems to realize that.

16:43.993 --> 16:46.557
Well, he's very, he hates this kind of work.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.581
He's a very orthodox Catholic.

16:50.168 --> 16:52.893
I don't think the good stuff was left out.

16:52.913 --> 16:54.436
I'm just saying there's lots of stuff.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.584
And some of the things, I think, are very good were left out, yes.

16:59.787 --> 17:02.812
But there's some things that also are very good that are in there.

17:02.973 --> 17:06.920
Are you hopeful that more texts will be found?

17:06.940 --> 17:12.531
It would be very interesting, although I think it could easily be, you know, another find would be.

17:13.372 --> 17:15.896
would be on earth that we certainly don't know.

17:16.016 --> 17:18.860
What would be a missing link for you?

17:18.940 --> 17:20.682
There's a lot of texts that we don't know.

17:20.802 --> 17:25.649
I mean, there are probably hundreds that we have titles of that we don't know anything about.

17:26.010 --> 17:28.854
Well, many, many more than we have texts.

17:29.975 --> 17:35.102
It seems to happen throughout, of course, the body of cultural textual transmission.

17:35.122 --> 17:42.653
Well, I got a call a few years ago from somebody who said that he had the Gospel of Judas Iscariot, and he shocked me because

17:43.342 --> 17:48.388
Irenaeus tells us in the year 160 that there is a gospel of Judas Iscariot, and we've never seen it.

17:48.909 --> 17:51.192
So I realized it was possible.

17:52.874 --> 17:58.201
And he did have, he is a dealer in rare books, and he is a very well-known dealer.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.964
These things are so seductive, aren't they?

18:00.984 --> 18:11.678
Because they're supposed to be Shakespeare's Love Labors One, you know, because the Stationist Register says that Shakespeare entered a play called Love Labors, as opposed to Love's, where Love Labors Lost.

18:12.535 --> 18:14.117
So, where's the lost play?

18:14.137 --> 18:25.049
You know, there was one play that he supposedly had written, which he had lost, I guess, a character who survived.

18:25.069 --> 18:30.415
That's supposedly a lost Shakespeare play that I found in her.

18:30.435 --> 18:32.177
It's a great opportunity for a forger.

18:33.658 --> 18:36.742
Sure, sure, if you can write that well.

18:36.762 --> 18:41.327
Do you run across any much material that they

18:41.493 --> 18:43.577
determined to be fraudulent or to be a hoax?

18:44.398 --> 18:48.767
Yeah, I mean, that one, for example, the Gospel of Judas Iscariot, was named that.

18:48.807 --> 18:50.490
I went to Cleveland to see it.

18:50.510 --> 18:51.532
You went to see it.

18:51.552 --> 18:53.035
Yeah, I did.

18:53.055 --> 18:55.479
But it wasn't a very interesting text, unfortunately.

18:55.499 --> 18:55.860
It wasn't.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.305
It was clearly something that had meant that.

18:58.325 --> 19:04.817
No, and the owner was hyping it, you know, that it was a dialogue between Judas Iscariot and Jesus about the betrayal, but it wasn't anything like that.

19:04.932 --> 19:09.377
Now, of these fifty-two codices, I do believe a few were destroyed, weren't they?

19:09.397 --> 19:12.121
Yeah, actually, it's not fifty-two codices, it's fifty-two texts.

19:12.141 --> 19:14.063
Fifty-two texts, twenty-something.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.405
Oh, yeah, fifty-two texts.

19:15.425 --> 19:16.907
I forget how many codices.

19:19.109 --> 19:28.701
There's eleven?

19:28.721 --> 19:29.181
Yeah, I think so.

19:29.202 --> 19:34.568
Do you think natural selection plays a role in what's about vibes, or what kind, in terms of

19:35.003 --> 19:37.287
I think it's an evolutionary phrase.

19:37.487 --> 19:37.787
Sure.

19:38.128 --> 19:45.019
In the sense that texts that are popular get copied and copied and copied.

19:45.039 --> 19:51.529
And actually, natural selection plays a large role, I think, in the development of humans, you know, in what people accept.

19:51.870 --> 20:00.083
It's not all as, you know, some people would think it's a grand conspiracy on the part of the Vatican or some paranoid fantasy about what they do.

20:00.434 --> 20:05.703
It's just that there are certain texts that are very appealing, which is also what Mark is very appealing, I think.

20:05.723 --> 20:06.183
It's interesting.

20:06.203 --> 20:18.263
I had an interview with Christopher Ricks a couple of weeks ago, and we were talking about poetry, and then inevitably the discussion of the literary canon comes up, and how does he feel about the canonization of literary texts?

20:18.283 --> 20:22.931
It bothers him, because he said that word obviously does come from sacred texts.

20:23.151 --> 20:24.754
It comes from a whole other sphere.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.494
And implies censorship.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.316
And definitely implies censorship.

20:29.476 --> 20:37.024
And where Helen Venla, for instance, believes that, I said, how do you feel that canons, I think, in a literary sense have developed?

20:37.044 --> 20:38.006
And she said other writers.

20:38.826 --> 20:48.017
It's not people who get together in a kind of little committee of the NLA or whatever and say, we are designating the Library of America or the French Playad editions.

20:48.037 --> 20:50.280
These are now canonical texts.

20:50.300 --> 20:53.323
And she believes over time it's other writers who

20:53.692 --> 20:55.794
give their apparition to texts.

20:55.814 --> 20:57.817
I wonder if there's anything similar.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.260
Well, they're writers and readers, too.

21:01.281 --> 21:06.206
I think, you know, the Gospel of Mark.

21:06.346 --> 21:17.218
I mean, you may remember that Alex McGowan was an actor who performs the Gospel of Mark.

21:17.238 --> 21:18.540
And he came here to perform it.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.242
He's a British actor.

21:20.262 --> 21:23.125
But he simply spoke it.

21:23.712 --> 21:27.596
And you can recite it in an hour and a half.

21:27.616 --> 21:28.717
And he did the parts.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.441
He did a very vivid rendering of the Gospel of Mark.

21:32.461 --> 21:34.884
And so that's probably the way people heard it.

21:36.185 --> 21:41.330
They probably heard it as a performance.

21:43.653 --> 21:46.236
So I think it has a lot to do with the livelihoods of the stories.

21:46.256 --> 21:49.219
I mean, the Gospel of John has a lot of good stories in it, too.

21:50.100 --> 21:50.800
What would you like?

21:50.840 --> 21:53.263
What would really please you to learn?

21:53.699 --> 21:57.464
has just been discovered as an ancient text.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.124
Well, that's interesting.

21:58.144 --> 21:59.827
Well, I love the Gospel of Thomas.

21:59.847 --> 22:03.791
I'd like to see the rest of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, the Gospel of Judas.

22:05.894 --> 22:08.357
You know, there are many other things.

22:08.377 --> 22:09.478
And you're convinced they're out there.

22:09.499 --> 22:11.121
They're not out there, but they were.

22:11.141 --> 22:11.721
They did exist, yeah.

22:11.781 --> 22:14.024
They did exist.

22:14.044 --> 22:14.144
Yeah.

22:14.164 --> 22:20.432
But we only found a very small fraction of, you know, there's hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of texts.

22:21.323 --> 22:23.085
But it's very interesting to find.

22:23.105 --> 22:30.372
You find out it's different with writers, what Helen Bendler said about poetry.

22:30.432 --> 22:37.039
I mean, and she is part of a literary establishment at Harvard and the whole business.

22:37.079 --> 22:40.021
And we are part of it here and so forth.

22:40.042 --> 22:50.672
But in the case of the Christian canon, it has to do with the institutionalization of particular people and their legitimation.

22:51.158 --> 23:01.312
as rulers of the Christian churches, you know, whether it's Pope Shenouda III in Egypt, or whether it's, you know, John Paul.

23:02.473 --> 23:09.843
Not meaning to go too far off the track, but do you feel that a religion, any religion, needs a text to validate itself?

23:10.344 --> 23:11.205
I mean, is it essential?

23:11.225 --> 23:12.747
No, I think some more than others.

23:13.107 --> 23:21.098
That's interesting, because you know that the ones called the people of the book are the people for whom the book is primary, so it's really...

23:21.550 --> 23:25.695
Jewish tradition that establishes itself through written text.

23:26.456 --> 23:32.343
And, of course, this is an offshoot of that, and so is this one.

23:32.843 --> 23:34.565
Buddhists, of course, have text.

23:34.585 --> 23:37.529
Hindus have, well, they do have a big data.

23:37.549 --> 23:41.694
Well, Buddhism was transmitted orally for at least five hundred years, I think, before this.

23:41.714 --> 23:42.535
Yeah.

23:42.555 --> 23:49.583
So they had the sutras, and they had teachings, but often they were orally transmitted.

23:49.968 --> 23:53.153
It's certainly much more the case for Western religions that we know.

23:53.533 --> 23:59.202
However, in antiquity you have lots of religions that have very few texts.

23:59.222 --> 24:08.335
The religion of the god Mithra or the ancient temples for the gods were not based on books at all.

24:08.355 --> 24:14.524
They were based on ritual practice and what you do in the temple and gathering the community.

24:15.466 --> 24:18.410
celebrating games and honoring the gods.

24:18.430 --> 24:19.511
It was not about that.

24:19.531 --> 24:28.563
Are you familiar with an exhibition in 1963, and it was a British library, and it was called Printing in the Mind of Man, 1963.

24:28.583 --> 24:33.469
And it's kind of given me the premise for this book that I'm working on.

24:33.489 --> 24:44.443
It was an exhibition of what they had decided were 440 books since prints over the previous violent years that had measurably impacted it.

24:45.537 --> 24:46.919
440 books?

24:46.939 --> 24:47.880
Yeah, they picked 440.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.381
Only 14 American books.

24:50.002 --> 24:52.245
But there have been any number of different books.

24:52.265 --> 25:03.878
And it's not just Copernicus and Newton and Einstein and Freud, but it's Volta and Electricity or Harvey and the Circulation of Blood.

25:04.398 --> 25:08.083
Baden-Powell and the Creation of the Boy Scouts, for instance.

25:08.103 --> 25:14.650
Influential books, not books that necessarily changed the world, but made significant, interesting things happen.

25:15.322 --> 25:23.395
And then two of the books are, and then there was a similar exhibition at the Groyer Club in New York where they picked 100 influential books.

25:23.455 --> 25:28.384
And so you had Joseph Smith, you know, his Book of Mormon, and you had Mary Baker Eddy, her book.

25:28.404 --> 25:35.315
These are cases, again, of fairly recent religious movements, but where it's a book.

25:35.335 --> 25:37.238
And what's significant about them, I would guess.

25:37.659 --> 25:41.886
I mean, I could show you dozens of others that I get sent every day.

25:42.625 --> 25:49.093
And what's not so significant as Mary Baker, Eddie, or Joseph Smith is that those have movements, right?

25:49.113 --> 25:54.000
Those have institutions, which are quite extraordinary and worldwide, you know?

25:55.081 --> 25:56.343
And fairly recent.

25:56.363 --> 25:56.683
Yeah.

25:57.024 --> 26:07.958
But, you know, that kind of book, actually, may be, and there's a very interesting analysis by a scholar of ancient Rome,

26:08.512 --> 26:13.638
Fergus Miller, called The Roman Near East, in which he says, really, it's... Where is it?

26:13.658 --> 26:13.959
Fergus?

26:13.979 --> 26:14.720
Fergus Miller.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.120
Fergus.

26:16.182 --> 26:17.563
The Roman Near East.

26:17.583 --> 26:28.076
He says that, really, it's the book, the scriptures, that gives a sense of continuity to Western.

26:28.517 --> 26:33.023
That's exactly what I... Because, I mean... The Roman Near East is the title.

26:33.043 --> 26:37.108
I remember I was... That's what I see the publisher is.

26:37.128 --> 26:37.388
I don't know.

26:37.604 --> 26:45.696
He was talking about the Phoenicians, the Babylonians.

26:45.736 --> 26:54.228
I mean, those ancient peoples don't have their, well, put it this way.

26:54.528 --> 26:58.614
I was teaching with a colleague, of course, called Judaism and Christianity, some controversial issues.

26:59.716 --> 27:03.882
And the students, this was in New York, they weren't interested in what we were interested in.

27:05.009 --> 27:07.913
he and I, but they were interested in who was right.

27:09.055 --> 27:15.745
And at a certain point, one of the students said to me, she was very upset about something, but where are the Babylonians today?

27:16.566 --> 27:17.508
And I said, well, what do you mean?

27:17.528 --> 27:18.970
They're alive and well and living in Brooklyn.

27:18.990 --> 27:21.153
And she looked at me like I was totally insane.

27:22.115 --> 27:31.148
And I thought, now, isn't it interesting that she thinks that she has a continuity with people who lived 3,000 years ago?

27:32.911 --> 27:33.852
How does she get that?

27:34.135 --> 27:35.076
How does she get it?

27:35.096 --> 27:36.819
Fergus Miller says she gets it through the Bible.

27:37.620 --> 27:38.561
These are our people.

27:38.881 --> 27:44.309
There's Adam, and there's Abraham, and there's our people, and we are these tribes, and so forth and so forth.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.430
And there is a continuity.

27:45.490 --> 27:49.256
Now, there are plenty of other people who were living in, you know, 3,000 years ago.

27:49.276 --> 27:52.520
That's not very long ago, by my standards.

27:54.242 --> 27:59.329
But no people, there aren't people who necessarily say, I belong to them.

28:00.311 --> 28:03.535
You know, the ancient Phoenicians are my people, or whatever.

28:04.392 --> 28:30.147
So, it's the book, Fergus Miller argues, that creates an imaginary... Was the book in a generic sense, or the book in a... No, the very specific book, the Bible, the Hebrew Bible, that creates a sense of continuity, so that people in Ohio today, not to speak about Ohio, but in New Jersey, in New Jersey,

28:31.544 --> 28:36.469
walking around in the 21st century will say, well, what should I do?

28:36.489 --> 28:39.071
What would Jesus do?

28:39.091 --> 28:43.015
You think, gee, that's 2,000 years old.

28:43.035 --> 28:53.165
But that person is trying to organize a life around a sense of continuity with Jesus in Nazareth.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.287
Now that's pretty amazing.

28:55.307 --> 29:00.572
So, you know, they're claiming a kind of continuity, and that's only created by that book.

29:00.991 --> 29:06.135
by the appendage to the Hebrew Bible, which is the writings of the followers of Jesus.

29:06.155 --> 29:15.123
So I'm just saying, Fergus Miller suggests that it is the Bible that creates an imaginary community.

29:16.564 --> 29:18.346
I'm not sure if he uses that term, but I would.

29:18.966 --> 29:24.852
An imaginary community, a sense of continuity with those people, which many cultures don't have.

29:25.832 --> 29:30.036
Now, if you go to Egypt, of course, have you been here?

29:30.421 --> 29:35.307
Well, there the continuity exists in stone, right?

29:35.327 --> 29:44.237
The Egyptians have visible evidence of their continuity with the ancient world.

29:45.439 --> 29:46.660
But many people don't have that.

29:47.521 --> 29:52.927
Well, the Great, which is not Egypt, but it's in Persia, the Cliff of Begislu.

29:52.947 --> 29:53.508
You're familiar with it.

29:53.528 --> 29:56.091
There's a traveling little description of Darius the Great.

29:57.235 --> 29:58.897
And it was on a cliff that nobody could read.

29:58.977 --> 30:02.161
I mean, so it was 500 feet up, and they smoothed it over.

30:02.522 --> 30:08.149
And so you wonder, really, who these inscriptions were put on the rocks for.

30:08.169 --> 30:10.131
They were the gods.

30:10.151 --> 30:15.178
Was it Mayer or Robinson, who was 1838, 1836?

30:15.198 --> 30:19.163
It was three years even before the invention of the daguerreotype.

30:19.183 --> 30:21.566
And so he could look at it with a telescope from the ground.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.428
And he said, I suppose I could draw it.

30:24.758 --> 30:32.687
to draw copies, but really he did these heroic things to go up and dangle from the cliff and to make these casts, they call them squeezes, of these.

30:32.707 --> 30:36.852
And remember, this was the key, by the way, to deciphering Kenia for him.

30:36.872 --> 30:38.033
And this is in the 1840s.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.757
But you wonder, who were they putting it up there for?

30:40.777 --> 30:43.260
And it was a great tribute to Tarius.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.143
He defeated a couple of armies.

30:46.163 --> 30:46.964
But it's a text.

30:46.984 --> 30:53.972
It's absolutely a text that's carved on the cliff of a mountain in Tehran, one day Iran.

30:54.712 --> 31:00.297
Well, those give people a sense of community.

31:00.357 --> 31:10.107
I was thinking about the Norse epics or the Iliad, you know, give people a sense of these are our people.

31:10.147 --> 31:11.408
Hello?

31:11.708 --> 31:22.238
I'll leave a few.

31:24.901 --> 31:26.203
The tape isn't with me?

31:26.223 --> 31:32.712
No, no, no, I just shut it off.

31:32.732 --> 31:41.024
I've read an awful lot of stories about you, so I've been trying to avoid replicating the things you answered elsewhere, but I am really interested in how you came.

31:41.825 --> 31:51.558
I know about you coming to New York and dancing and feeling, well, unless I'm going to be truly fabulous at what I do here.

31:51.959 --> 31:54.182
Ambitionism.

31:55.225 --> 32:00.591
I was just wondering about the lore of these texts and what it was.

32:00.611 --> 32:02.213
Well, when I started to read them.

32:02.233 --> 32:05.276
I mean, I was just told that they were ridiculous, you know.

32:05.677 --> 32:07.759
And this is when you were at Stanford, or is this not what you're at?

32:07.779 --> 32:08.540
No, only at Harvard.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.761
I mean, no, I never heard of them.

32:10.702 --> 32:13.886
So what did you major in at Stanford?

32:13.966 --> 32:15.447
History and dance.

32:15.628 --> 32:16.088
And dance.

32:16.108 --> 32:19.392
So really, this was not part of the discourse at that particular point.

32:19.832 --> 32:21.014
Nobody knew about this stuff.

32:21.474 --> 32:24.017
I went there to study the beginning of the Christian movement.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.978
I didn't know there were all these secret gospels that I discovered.

32:27.998 --> 32:31.383
If they hadn't been published yet, they were still in content.

32:31.403 --> 32:31.563
Amazing.

32:32.264 --> 32:33.666
So I was just amazed.

32:33.746 --> 32:35.348
And what was it about them?

32:35.368 --> 32:36.670
I mean, first of all, it was fun.

32:36.690 --> 32:39.033
We had all this amazing stuff.

32:39.634 --> 32:40.055
What is it?

32:40.555 --> 32:44.381
And second, I really like these texts.

32:44.401 --> 32:47.685
The Gospel of Thomas, as you can see, I love this text.

32:47.905 --> 32:51.130
And many people, I mean, you say, what do you bring to the text?

32:51.150 --> 32:51.711
What do you assume?

32:52.191 --> 32:53.413
Well, many people thought,

32:55.267 --> 33:07.986
We were told then that they would just be, as my beloved professor, Mr. Stendhal, said recently to me, he said, well, before you wrote about them, we just thought these texts were weird.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.030
And, of course, we did.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.132
I mean, we were told they were weird.

33:12.152 --> 33:13.393
This is a professor, a scholar.

33:13.634 --> 33:14.435
Yes, yes.

33:14.495 --> 33:15.977
An authority in this field.

33:16.218 --> 33:22.887
He's a New Testament scholar, retired now, and he was the dean of the Harvard Divinity School, Swedish Lutheran Archbishop.

33:23.688 --> 33:24.750
We just thought they were weird.

33:25.287 --> 33:27.289
And he was an expert on the Dead Sea School.

33:29.591 --> 33:32.554
And I was told they were blasphemous and strange, and they didn't make sense.

33:32.574 --> 33:33.435
They were kind of garbled.

33:33.455 --> 33:35.217
They were kind of just a bunch of magical nonsense.

33:35.237 --> 33:36.698
These were by your teachers who told you they were?

33:36.718 --> 33:36.898
Nonsense.

33:37.179 --> 33:37.759
Yeah.

33:37.779 --> 33:39.221
So they were discouraging you from?

33:39.301 --> 33:41.623
Well, they thought it was interesting, but we ought to publish them.

33:41.663 --> 33:47.269
But they just, you know, they were mostly quite serious Christians, certainly Christopher is.

33:47.289 --> 33:51.593
And this stuff just didn't look like anything they'd seen.

33:52.294 --> 33:54.636
And I started to read the Gospel of Thomas, and I thought,

33:55.308 --> 33:59.173
You know, when I read this, if you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you.

33:59.893 --> 34:02.757
And I thought, well, you know, that's really powerful.

34:04.058 --> 34:04.939
You don't have to believe it.

34:04.959 --> 34:12.268
It's just sort of, it's just a recognition that there's a powerful truth in it.

34:12.288 --> 34:14.991
And I don't really care whether Jesus said it, you know.

34:15.051 --> 34:17.454
I mean, I was just very struck by the word.

34:17.734 --> 34:19.416
But the words resonate with you.

34:19.596 --> 34:22.800
Yeah, and secondly, we were told, well, uh,

34:24.485 --> 34:32.215
a lot of people began to say, well, maybe these aren't just totally weird, maybe these are actual sayings of Jesus when he was in Galilee.

34:32.235 --> 34:43.749
And some of them obviously are, like, blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven, or, you know, some of those sayings are so well known, and you know them in Matthew, that, sure, they probably are Jesus' teachings.

34:43.769 --> 34:52.440
He talks about the destruction of the temple, you know, I will destroy this house, it must be a reference to the temple, that's the charge in which he was executed.

34:52.460 --> 34:52.720
So,

34:53.020 --> 34:55.003
Yes, there's a lot of sayings of Jesus in there.

34:55.023 --> 35:07.621
So many people thought, as John Dominic Crossan, I don't know if you know his work, but Crossan writes a lot about this stuff, popular books about it, and he's a good scholar of parables.

35:08.282 --> 35:14.590
He thought, well, the living Jesus of the Gospel of Thomas is just good old historical Jesus walking around.

35:14.610 --> 35:15.211
I don't think so.

35:16.173 --> 35:18.436
You know, I think it's much more mysterious.

35:18.496 --> 35:21.240
I think Jesus is a kind of divine presence speaking.

35:21.881 --> 35:22.842
You know, it's not about...

35:23.716 --> 35:29.364
some man in the first century Galilee, although that's what a lot of scholars now think.

35:29.405 --> 35:32.990
They think, well, oh, this isn't about some transcendent being.

35:33.010 --> 35:34.813
This is just about an ordinary teacher.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.035
I don't think so.

35:36.856 --> 35:41.483
They thought about that man as a spokesman for the divine.

35:42.304 --> 35:51.197
It's not that he was so special any more than you or I, but that we are also very special because we're grounded in the divine source in the way that he was.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.980
So there's a very...

35:53.737 --> 36:01.750
sort of, if you like, a spiritual view of Jesus, but it's one that includes all being, which is very different.

36:02.191 --> 36:05.998
Now, you came to this as a Ph.D.

36:06.018 --> 36:07.039
candidate at Harvard, right?

36:07.059 --> 36:07.420
Yeah.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.964
And were the texts in facsimile there?

36:10.585 --> 36:12.769
I'm just wondering about your exposure to the texts.

36:12.789 --> 36:15.614
Well, we had, we were reading them.

36:15.634 --> 36:16.455
You were reading them.

36:16.475 --> 36:19.200
So it was part of the course of study, and you were reading them.

36:19.220 --> 36:19.440
Yeah, yeah.

36:19.657 --> 36:25.022
And so you were reading them as an, I hate to trivialize it, but as an exercise or something.

36:25.042 --> 36:29.065
Yeah, we were supposed to sort of, well, there's all this stuff we should translate and publish and so forth.

36:29.145 --> 36:29.425
Oh, publish.

36:29.445 --> 36:31.147
So publishing and publication was?

36:31.988 --> 36:32.388
Oh, yeah.

36:32.408 --> 36:34.450
I mean, our professors had that in mind.

36:34.470 --> 36:37.693
You know, the whole group of people would publish, and many of them did.

36:38.653 --> 36:43.918
Many of the people who went there are the people who are publishing them.

36:43.938 --> 36:49.663
And so you took it to the next step, which is not just read it, translate it, and publish it.

36:49.964 --> 37:01.742
Well, when I wrote the Gnostic Gospels, I mean, there were thousands of things written about these texts by then.

37:02.824 --> 37:05.107
I'd never heard of them until that book of yours, in 1979.

37:05.428 --> 37:05.789
No.

37:06.470 --> 37:18.368
There were thousands of articles and books in French and German, Spanish, Japanese.

37:19.715 --> 37:30.207
English, but just scholarly work, scholarly work, you know, saying, what is this body of literature?

37:30.407 --> 37:33.751
But I was asking myself, what difference does it make that we found this?

37:34.632 --> 37:39.097
I mean, what difference does it make to the way we understand the Christian movement?

37:39.938 --> 37:44.404
And is it possible to write about this in a way that engages people who aren't scholars?

37:44.724 --> 37:47.427
Because it's so exciting, this material.

37:48.065 --> 37:51.228
That's what I love, is that you took it to that level.

37:51.248 --> 37:51.369
Yeah.

37:51.649 --> 37:56.794
To make it, people say to me, why do you write books about bibliophiles and libraries?

37:57.655 --> 38:02.661
You know, I get this vacant look, you know, oh, you're writing about book collectors or off-site storage in libraries.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.242
I said, there's good stories there.

38:04.262 --> 38:05.143
Trust me when it does.

38:05.564 --> 38:09.668
You know, obviously I'm published by trade publishers, and there's a leadership in my book.

38:09.688 --> 38:17.937
But the point is to try and reach an intelligent audience out there that is interested in matters and

38:18.608 --> 38:25.236
But you really tapped into something, which was, I mean, the Gnostic gospel was electrifying.

38:25.256 --> 38:26.717
It was my first year of National Book Critics.

38:26.737 --> 38:31.283
I remember we were always a long way trying to find this book in the world.

38:31.303 --> 38:32.164
How did you know it then?

38:32.184 --> 38:33.525
Were you on the family?

38:33.545 --> 38:34.306
I was a member.

38:34.366 --> 38:38.451
I was actually a founding member of the year.

38:38.471 --> 38:45.740
My predecessor, I was a book editor in Worcester, Massachusetts, and my predecessor there was the founder of the National Book Critics.

38:45.760 --> 38:45.880
I see.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.822
That was the award that Jason S. died.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.321
Well, that's a nice one.

38:49.341 --> 38:50.764
Forget about the National.

38:50.784 --> 38:51.004
Yeah.

38:51.024 --> 38:57.194
Well, my first book was a finalist for that award, which I was in the 20s.

38:57.374 --> 38:59.577
That was a gentleman that's in Leomania.

38:59.878 --> 39:02.021
Oh, yes.

39:02.041 --> 39:10.094
Well, I had asked Christa Stendhal, you know, why didn't you write about the Dead Sea Scroll when you knew about this stuff?

39:10.114 --> 39:12.137
Because that's what... Before, before, I mean, Wilson.

39:12.197 --> 39:12.638
Yes, yes.

39:12.658 --> 39:13.619
It was in the 50s, I think.

39:13.639 --> 39:15.362
Before, well, Christa was working on this.

39:15.933 --> 39:17.094
He knew all about this stuff.

39:17.114 --> 39:20.017
He was going around to synagogues giving talks about the D.C.

39:20.037 --> 39:20.758
scrolls.

39:20.778 --> 39:21.519
It was different.

39:21.539 --> 39:22.620
There was a cartel.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.503
They were restricting access to it.

39:25.523 --> 39:27.265
Well, they were to this stuff, too.

39:27.285 --> 39:27.545
Really?

39:27.645 --> 39:28.206
Absolutely.

39:28.486 --> 39:29.046
Absolutely.

39:29.066 --> 39:30.328
Do you think scholars were... Fear?

39:30.348 --> 39:30.948
For the same reason?

39:30.968 --> 39:31.949
Or was it just control?

39:31.989 --> 39:32.050
No.

39:32.170 --> 39:36.614
They wanted the glory of publishing these things, the same way the people in the D.C.

39:36.674 --> 39:37.815
scrolls did.

39:37.835 --> 39:41.579
But I asked him, why didn't you write about this before Edmund Wilson did?

39:41.599 --> 39:45.163
And he said, well, we...

39:45.667 --> 39:55.079
And I thought that it might trouble people to think that Jesus wasn't as unique as they wanted to think.

39:55.099 --> 39:58.123
So it's their reading of a text that they're making decisions.

39:58.424 --> 39:58.604
Yes.

39:58.684 --> 40:00.727
He's a clergyman.

40:00.867 --> 40:02.309
That's kind of dangerous waters.

40:02.509 --> 40:05.293
I said, I said, that's so condescending.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.935
And he laughed.

40:06.955 --> 40:07.716
He's a wonderful man.

40:07.736 --> 40:09.818
And he said, well, yes, it is.

40:09.858 --> 40:11.080
That's how the clergy was.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.622
It'll hurt us if we read it.

40:12.762 --> 40:14.104
I mean, it's fine.

40:14.776 --> 40:16.939
It will shake our faith, do you think?

40:16.959 --> 40:17.639
Is that the feeling?

40:17.720 --> 40:26.610
Yeah, I think so, because to find out that it isn't just Jesus, but there are a lot of other radical Jews in the first century going around saying things like, the end of the world is coming.

40:27.071 --> 40:30.495
Harold Bloom tells me he's an agnostic, by the way.

40:30.515 --> 40:30.996
Yes, he does.

40:31.036 --> 40:40.748
Which I love, you know, because he started, this is a, I think a couple of years ago, I forget what it is, he would really like to have an agnostic sermon, he said.

40:40.768 --> 40:42.690
And then he started to laugh, he said, because really,

40:42.788 --> 40:43.349
We do.

40:43.389 --> 40:45.231
It would be an audience of one, you know.

40:45.771 --> 40:47.533
That was crazy.

40:47.634 --> 40:49.375
I don't entirely agree with him.

40:49.436 --> 40:53.340
I mean, I always enjoy him, but we do have Gnostic sermons.

40:53.540 --> 40:56.123
The Gospel of Truth is one of those, and it's very beautiful.

40:57.064 --> 40:57.385
It's beautiful.

40:57.405 --> 41:01.009
Well, it's kind of religion that we can all really like.

41:01.029 --> 41:05.153
I mean, I think it's a very appealing concept.

41:05.814 --> 41:07.316
I think so.

41:07.396 --> 41:09.218
For people who have open minds.

41:09.991 --> 41:27.007
Beyond belief, I guess the question has to be, especially the way you begin it, and I don't want to get into that, but was it a form of therapy as well as a form of scholarship for you to do what you did?

41:27.227 --> 41:29.909
Well, I guess you could call it that.

41:29.970 --> 41:38.057
I mean, it certainly, I realized when I wrote Adam Even the Serpent, and, um,

41:39.910 --> 41:43.775
And Bill Moyers asked me about the book and about things that were going on in my life.

41:43.835 --> 41:56.211
And it was the first time I had sort of completely recognized how, I mean, I was aware that it's very personal, the work that I do.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.633
Like any art, you know?

41:58.594 --> 42:01.298
No matter what it is, I'm sure yours is.

42:02.820 --> 42:06.745
And it may be more or less visible to the reader.

42:07.687 --> 42:13.793
But I was quite aware that my life and my work are completely connected.

42:13.813 --> 42:16.435
So, yes, it works out issues I have to deal with.

42:16.475 --> 42:23.042
I mean, I think I write to clarify issues that I want to clarify.

42:23.142 --> 42:26.886
You wouldn't go so far as to say they're cathartic in any way.

42:27.326 --> 42:30.729
Working out comes close, doesn't it?

42:30.749 --> 42:36.715
I don't know, because that suggests that one has a

42:37.133 --> 42:44.862
one for all sort of a single release moment as, you know, in a tragedy or something.

42:44.882 --> 42:49.327
There's a moment in which sort of the grief or whatever is let go.

42:50.588 --> 42:53.591
I don't find it that simple actually in real life.

42:53.612 --> 42:59.999
But all of my books work out questions that I find I have to deal with.

43:00.019 --> 43:03.783
Working out for yourself in the process of what you have.

43:03.803 --> 43:03.923
Sure.

43:03.943 --> 43:04.744
The Nazi Gospels was

43:05.551 --> 43:21.848
directed toward people who, like me, were interested in questions about religion and spirituality, but disaffected from institutions.

43:21.868 --> 43:26.373
And these texts gave me a way to talk about that issue.

43:26.934 --> 43:32.740
Isn't it something that you go and you find this in texts that are about 1700 years old?

43:32.905 --> 43:34.907
I think it's a stunt.

43:34.927 --> 43:37.710
You know, I've been reading the Varieties of Religious Experience.

43:37.730 --> 43:41.654
Do you know William James's Varieties of Religious?

43:41.674 --> 43:50.603
I've been reading that, and he's talking about religious experience and how people want an immediate, direct sense of contact with the Divine, you know?

43:51.123 --> 43:59.752
So being an American psychiatrist, he goes to journals and conversations with psychiatrists and reports of conversion and so forth and so forth.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.895
And just now, my desk is full of

44:03.331 --> 44:06.275
similar accounts, which are thousands of years old.

44:06.676 --> 44:12.143
Some of them from Nakamati, some of them in Jewish sources, some of them in the New Testament.

44:12.343 --> 44:16.549
You don't have to go to 20th century accounts to find that.

44:17.330 --> 44:20.895
And they're very powerful.

44:20.915 --> 44:24.800
So, I guess it's interesting to me to find that, you know.

44:24.820 --> 44:31.549
And it's essential for you, obviously, because you can, to read the document in its original.

44:31.569 --> 44:32.190
Yes, it is.

44:32.963 --> 44:36.587
Because otherwise you're dealing with somebody else's interpretation of it, of course.

44:37.208 --> 44:47.661
And even when you read them in Coptic or Greek, you're dealing with your own English, I'm translating into English, sadly, you know, the Greek.

44:48.082 --> 44:54.029
And then what you're reading is still a copy of something that had been written 300 years prior, isn't it?

44:54.049 --> 44:54.149
Yeah.

44:54.169 --> 45:01.418
So there's, you know, all these fascinating layers of interpretation that play into the way we read.

45:02.073 --> 45:04.076
That's wonderful.

45:04.096 --> 45:20.921
You wonder how many people in the world can do this, who have a facility of logic and have the intellectual acumen and perception to come and to do this and to be interested in doing it and to derive meaning out of it.

45:20.941 --> 45:28.873
But then, as you said, I at least have to do it as most of us do today, I would say, self-conscious.

45:30.457 --> 45:53.760
I'm reading with a twenty-first century view, you know, of somebody who's, you know, a professor in some establishment like this, and with certain kinds of experiences attuning me to certain parts of it, and probably making others, making me oblivious to others, you know?

45:54.401 --> 46:00.227
I just recently got a couple of books from Oxford, and I just read them.

46:00.865 --> 46:04.129
The Acknowledgements of Beyond Belief, The Lost Christianity.

46:04.229 --> 46:05.490
Oh, Bart Ehrman.

46:05.511 --> 46:10.997
Yeah, and I haven't had a chance to, but I have gone home.

46:11.017 --> 46:23.111
How, because there are so many books on these lost texts and discovered texts, rediscovered, recovered, all of these different words I use, lost, recovered, discovered.

46:23.131 --> 46:28.237
Is this kind of complementary to what you're doing with the material that he has there?

46:28.257 --> 46:30.400
Well, I would say, I would,

46:31.696 --> 46:34.138
I don't want to deprecate Bart Ehrman's work.

46:34.619 --> 46:36.580
He's trying to get a sense of where he's at.

46:36.681 --> 46:38.162
Let me just tell you where he's at.

46:38.482 --> 46:52.475
I would look at the work of Steve Patterson, Marv Meyer, many other scholars working on the text, many people who translate this stuff and read this stuff.

46:52.515 --> 46:54.357
There are lots of very good scholars.

46:55.618 --> 46:59.121
My problem with Bart Ehrman is that he's a New Testament scholar.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.743
He writes good texts on New Testament.

47:02.184 --> 47:03.125
He knows that stuff.

47:03.206 --> 47:05.249
I think he must be some Orthodox Christian.

47:06.210 --> 47:10.696
Because when he comes to these other texts, why does he come to these other sort of lost Christianity?

47:10.817 --> 47:12.098
Well, you'll see if you look at the book.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.201
Why does he do it?

47:14.262 --> 47:16.104
Because everybody's talking about them.

47:16.144 --> 47:20.631
He's just now finishing a book on the Da Vinci Code because he wants to ride the wave.

47:20.851 --> 47:22.273
There's a bestseller, which is

47:22.642 --> 47:24.044
I know, Dan Burstein's book.

47:24.064 --> 47:27.668
But I mean, but his, you know, it's kind of the anti-Da Vinci Code book.

47:27.688 --> 47:28.268
Have you seen that?

47:28.729 --> 47:35.276
The Da Vinci Code is number one in fiction, but then over in non-fiction, down there about 10 or 12, is decoding the Da Vinci Code.

47:36.317 --> 47:36.457
Uh-huh.

47:36.477 --> 47:43.105
But it's amazing how critical work brought out in the air of publication itself becomes a major test.

47:43.125 --> 47:50.573
Well, Bart is hoping for that, but the point is, he's never written about these texts before, and he does so from

47:51.532 --> 47:59.464
telling you that from the beginning, some texts are really Orthodox, and some texts are really Gnostic.

47:59.624 --> 48:08.597
And by that he means escapist, dualistic, nihilistic, and all of the clichés that everybody has always said from the 1880s.

48:09.379 --> 48:20.475
So when he sort of lost Christianities, he's basically looking at the editing process that went into the making of the New Testament, and maybe these texts were perhaps worthy, but really not.

48:21.046 --> 48:21.727
Partly, yes.

48:21.828 --> 48:23.270
I mean, like all of us.

48:23.290 --> 48:28.501
But it's not like this other stuff that's really kind of fundamentally challenging the whole structure.

48:28.761 --> 48:33.070
No, because we would all say there are lots of Christianity, lots of Judaism.

48:33.110 --> 48:35.815
That's just the way scholars talk these days.

48:36.217 --> 48:41.003
His own view is that there are some really good ones and there are some really bad ones, and he knows what you're with.

48:41.103 --> 48:42.585
So this is part of the editing process.

48:42.605 --> 48:47.330
Yeah, so he'll tell you that Thomas is proto-Gnostic, that it's escapist, it's nihilist.

48:47.350 --> 48:51.775
If you read in his Introduction to the New Testament what he says about the Gospel of Thomas, it's ridiculous.

48:51.856 --> 48:53.397
And I talked to him about it two years ago.

48:53.838 --> 49:02.769
I said, Bart, why are you saying that you can't read the Gospel of Thomas if you don't understand, before you read it, that it's escapist, dualistic, nihilistic, etc.?

49:03.049 --> 49:04.030
Because it isn't any of it.

49:05.140 --> 49:06.622
I said, have you read it?

49:06.642 --> 49:07.203
Of course he's read it.

49:07.824 --> 49:10.428
He said, well, it doesn't make sense if you don't read it that way.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.210
And I said, it makes perfect.

49:12.230 --> 49:13.372
It's completely monistic.

49:13.392 --> 49:15.034
There's not a touch of dualism.

49:16.316 --> 49:17.758
What are you talking about?

49:17.778 --> 49:21.484
He only can see it as a heretical book.

49:21.684 --> 49:22.886
And so with all these other things.

49:22.906 --> 49:26.892
There's got to be something defective, or they'd be on the right side of the mind.

49:27.312 --> 49:29.055
So that's the presupposition.

49:29.435 --> 49:31.198
And that's why his work, I find it.

49:32.815 --> 49:35.879
Well, you just mentioned him in your own.

49:35.959 --> 49:37.261
No, I like Bart.

49:37.381 --> 49:39.203
We're friends.

49:39.223 --> 49:43.128
But I guess that's another concept you have to deal with, heresy.

49:43.148 --> 49:44.109
Yes, of course.

49:44.149 --> 49:58.708
The stigma of being heretical, and what are you doing, devoting your energy and your profession to these texts that may be perceived as heretical works, I guess.

49:58.728 --> 49:59.008
Yeah, sure.

50:00.676 --> 50:02.078
Tell me what your time comes down.

50:02.098 --> 50:03.439
I am okay until 3.30.

50:03.539 --> 50:04.640
Oh, good.

50:04.660 --> 50:05.721
So we can wrap it up.

50:05.741 --> 50:07.203
I've had close to an hour, which is just wonderful.

50:09.586 --> 50:10.827
I have the books.

50:11.748 --> 50:15.192
There's a wonderful body of stuff on LexisNexis.

50:15.212 --> 50:16.453
Who is that?

50:16.693 --> 50:17.194
What is that?

50:17.494 --> 50:22.219
Oh, that's a search engine.

50:22.239 --> 50:22.299
Oh.

50:22.319 --> 50:23.220
I've never looked.

50:23.501 --> 50:26.324
Billions of prints I haven't been sure.

50:28.246 --> 50:29.367
I get it at home.

50:29.819 --> 50:31.921
pay a fee to do it.

50:31.941 --> 50:37.767
So I can do a search for, I don't know, tables, agnostic texts.

50:37.787 --> 50:43.672
Just set up the different things, and it will give me stories that I've written about you and your work over the last 25 years.

50:44.133 --> 50:44.713
Oh, gosh.

50:45.214 --> 50:48.897
Somebody told me they can get all the reviews of this book, and I have never seen it.

50:48.917 --> 50:49.478
Is that right?

50:49.978 --> 50:51.960
Some people tell me they can get all the reviews.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.041
Oh, sure.

50:53.141 --> 50:54.883
I can do it for five minutes right here.

50:54.923 --> 50:55.223
Can you?

50:55.804 --> 50:56.084
Sure.

50:56.104 --> 50:56.184
How?

50:56.384 --> 50:58.166
If you have access to LexisNexis.

50:58.186 --> 50:59.067
Well, let's take a look.

51:00.582 --> 51:02.543
I don't know.
