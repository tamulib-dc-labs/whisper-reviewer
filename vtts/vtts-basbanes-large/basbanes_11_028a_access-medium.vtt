WEBVTT

00:04.267 --> 00:32.873
He came here in 529.

00:35.401 --> 00:38.965
And was there already an abbey here of some sort?

00:39.105 --> 00:41.687
Ah, c'era un... qualche cosa religiosa, no?

00:41.707 --> 00:43.449
Si, un culto ad Apollo.

00:43.950 --> 00:47.033
Ah, si, ma non cristiano.

00:47.734 --> 00:52.418
No, prima di... No, culto ad Apollo, culto a Giorgio.

00:52.438 --> 00:56.082
Ah, so the temple up here was... un templo di Apollo and Jupiter.

00:56.162 --> 00:58.525
Oh, that's not in chiesa monastica.

00:58.545 --> 01:04.851
PerÃ² prima di che fosse venuto Benedetto non c'era... No, before Benedetto was nothing Christian.

01:05.557 --> 01:20.697
The so-called library, which is where the books are stamped, is the first floor here, all along this floor, and there are still two floors.

01:20.737 --> 01:24.241
The printer was always in Austria, and it's also not closed.

01:24.342 --> 01:27.285
The printer was always in Austria, and it's also not closed.

01:27.325 --> 01:28.527
The printer was always in Austria.

01:28.591 --> 01:33.036
Ah, the printed books in the library.

01:33.056 --> 01:34.878
I don't know what it is.

01:35.139 --> 01:36.460
I don't know what it is.

01:36.701 --> 01:38.683
I don't know what it is.

01:38.703 --> 01:40.285
I don't know what it is.

01:40.305 --> 01:42.888
I don't know what it is.

01:42.908 --> 01:45.471
I don't know what it is.

01:45.491 --> 01:46.412
I don't know what it is.

01:46.432 --> 01:48.194
I don't know what it is.

01:48.354 --> 01:49.676
I don't know what it is.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.097
I don't know what it is.

01:51.157 --> 01:53.500
I don't know what it is.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.523
I don't know what it is.

01:55.923 --> 01:57.165
I don't know what it is.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.446
I don't know what it is.

02:00.940 --> 02:05.227
My eyes right here.

02:05.247 --> 02:05.348
Okay.

02:06.492 --> 02:28.660
What's your question?

02:28.680 --> 02:31.544
What's your question?

02:31.564 --> 02:31.984
What's your question?

02:32.004 --> 02:32.425
What's your question?

02:32.445 --> 02:32.865
What's your question?

02:32.885 --> 02:33.306
What's your question?

02:33.326 --> 02:33.746
What's your question?

02:33.766 --> 02:34.187
What's your question?

02:34.167 --> 02:42.085
If you want to come and work here, you have to stay in a hotel in the city.

02:42.402 --> 02:56.220
Francis Newton, a professor from Duke, comes here every sabbatical.

02:58.102 --> 03:02.027
This is my heaven.

03:02.107 --> 03:09.557
Oh my goodness.

03:13.182 --> 03:33.001
It used to be called the archive courtyard.

03:36.924 --> 03:39.747
But now it's called the library.

03:40.250 --> 03:46.379
courtyards because they moved the archives up there.

03:50.085 --> 04:02.724
I want to take a picture of this.

04:02.744 --> 04:06.510
If you have any specific questions, I'll answer your question.

04:06.710 --> 04:10.857
We must be very close to, what's his name?

04:11.218 --> 04:11.899
Faustino.

04:12.801 --> 04:14.043
Brother?

04:14.183 --> 04:18.892
Brother Don Faustino, they called him.

04:19.513 --> 04:21.196
F-A-U-S?

04:21.276 --> 04:30.793
F-A-U-S-T-I-N-O.

04:32.427 --> 04:47.230
So they move the archive so it's only the library.

04:49.334 --> 04:58.468
And he says it's not very presentable.

04:58.870 --> 05:22.201
It doesn't matter.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.685
You have to start that.

05:25.705 --> 05:25.946
Here you go.

05:25.966 --> 05:26.206
Here you go.

05:26.226 --> 05:26.466
Here you go.

05:26.486 --> 05:26.727
Here you go.

05:26.747 --> 05:26.987
Here you go.

05:27.052 --> 05:29.936
where there are empty shells.

05:30.136 --> 05:49.363
These used to have parchments inside, but mostly they've moved these things.

05:50.727 --> 05:52.730
How old is that?

05:52.750 --> 05:53.551
960.

05:54.071 --> 06:09.110
960.

06:09.511 --> 06:14.417
What is it?

06:14.477 --> 06:16.600
What is it?

06:17.221 --> 06:20.384
What do you say?

06:20.905 --> 06:46.772
It's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place where it's a place

06:47.123 --> 07:14.295
It's a legal student.

07:14.765 --> 07:30.290
This is a witness, this is my testimony that the land belongs to the land before.

07:30.771 --> 07:39.405
The three words were written in Italian.

07:41.039 --> 08:09.882
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

08:10.452 --> 08:19.705
I have a difference between the archive and the library.

08:19.745 --> 08:26.935
Ah, printed books, he says, are in the library.

08:27.075 --> 08:30.159
Ah, printed books, he says, are in the library.

08:30.219 --> 08:35.667
We have the first standard book in Italy, in 1465.

08:36.052 --> 08:44.864
They have another, they have a copy of the first book that Schreinheim and Panner.

08:44.944 --> 08:45.865
They do.

08:46.746 --> 08:48.288
They have it here.

08:48.308 --> 08:50.752
The father of the church.

08:50.772 --> 08:52.113
The father of the church.

08:55.598 --> 09:02.187
Hanno stampato tre titoli, ha studiato.

09:02.227 --> 09:05.451
Di Gerone e una grammatica che fa.

09:05.768 --> 09:11.995
So they have the Father, the Church, one of the three.

09:12.155 --> 09:17.260
Parchment.

09:18.001 --> 09:31.255
Ah, I like that, like parchment.

09:32.056 --> 09:33.818
Ah, okay.

09:34.068 --> 09:56.107
Oh, yeah, like the archives of the order.

09:56.468 --> 10:03.754
This abbey is a diocese has a bishop.

10:04.780 --> 10:14.593
Ah, so it was administered all the territories.

10:14.613 --> 10:25.928
Yes, because it's very complex.

10:26.144 --> 10:50.025
Not all monasteries are abbeys.

10:50.191 --> 11:01.584
Only people at convents are the Franciscans.

11:01.744 --> 11:11.034
I don't... Where the monks live is the monastery.

11:11.134 --> 11:19.303
I see.

11:19.908 --> 11:49.459
If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a... If the abbey is the head of the monastery, it's all a...

11:49.439 --> 12:02.749
Okay, if it has land, it's called an abbey, and if it has an abbot, who's the head monk.

12:02.769 --> 12:06.317
Otherwise, if it's too small, it doesn't have any land, it's called a monastery.

12:06.770 --> 12:13.096
But they're very similar.

12:13.856 --> 12:22.724
Look at these books.

12:23.605 --> 12:36.777
Bombardements.

12:36.757 --> 12:51.829
During the war, the German soldiers took them to Polanco and then the Vatican.

12:51.978 --> 13:04.581
But he has to tell the truth that the Germans saved this library, that the Allies bombed it.

13:04.681 --> 13:10.932
It's very important because they took the books away.

13:11.182 --> 13:33.105
So it was a British

13:33.473 --> 13:36.557
general named Alexander who gave the order to bomb.

13:36.577 --> 13:37.639
He was horrible.

13:38.039 --> 13:48.935
Yes, and Clark had been sent away to Amzio where he made the mistake of leaving the Americans on the beach.

13:49.035 --> 14:01.152
He's going to give us a book about the bombardment.

14:01.908 --> 14:12.045
These were all saved by, they were sent to Rome, is that right?

14:12.186 --> 14:16.573
Well, they first were brought to Spoleto.

14:16.613 --> 14:17.314
Where's Spoleto?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.819
In Umbria.

14:21.521 --> 14:24.827
S-P-O-L-E.

14:25.145 --> 14:33.917
He says, don't worry, because it's all written in the book.

14:34.177 --> 14:38.143
30,000 books.

14:38.163 --> 14:41.428
So the Germans took away.

14:41.488 --> 14:47.977
And took away also the archives.

14:49.619 --> 14:54.105
So the books that were destroyed were those from the 1880s.

14:54.338 --> 14:56.761
1,500 and modern books.

14:57.001 --> 15:01.848
More than 100,000 books were burned up in them.

15:03.530 --> 15:09.978
But these are incunables and they're incunabula.

15:10.699 --> 15:13.202
They have 280 incunabula.

15:14.844 --> 15:19.350
They have 290 incunabula.

15:19.634 --> 15:45.996
But this is the library here.

15:46.482 --> 16:04.666
They're going to incorporate those rooms into the library, which two years ago were part of the archives.

16:04.686 --> 16:07.630
This is the library here.

16:07.795 --> 16:19.527
Have you ever seen a library like this?

16:19.587 --> 16:22.710
See, these aren't incunibals, but I can tell you they're very old.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.272
Look at 1578, 1578, 1546.

16:24.572 --> 16:29.097
These are all very old books.

16:29.117 --> 16:34.022
They're not incunibals, but they're all 16th century.

16:34.947 --> 16:48.784
And how many students have been there?

16:48.804 --> 17:03.503
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

17:04.478 --> 17:14.755
So about a thousand, a thousand, one hundred readers per year.

17:14.775 --> 17:17.118
It's such a specialized library.

17:17.138 --> 17:19.963
They mostly come from England, USA, and Germany.

17:21.405 --> 17:22.086
Italiani?

17:24.771 --> 17:27.415
Italiani.

17:28.053 --> 17:31.496
They took 40.000 books away.

17:32.096 --> 17:57.098
40.000 books.

17:57.685 --> 18:25.887
40,000 printed books up to 1800, and then all the manuscripts and the archives in a military convoy to 1 Spoleto and then to the Vatican.

18:29.562 --> 18:56.802
I don't know what research is it.

18:57.187 --> 19:01.896
That's the first book printed in Italy?

19:02.076 --> 19:08.869
Yes, that's the first book printed in Italy.

19:08.889 --> 19:17.305
I have to get a picture of that.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.614
Oh, that's wonderful.

19:21.634 --> 19:23.657
And you can just stay right there.

19:23.677 --> 19:24.978
Put your hand, point.

19:25.139 --> 19:29.704
Yeah, just like that would be excellent.

19:31.466 --> 19:33.048
I have plenty of pictures with you.

19:33.068 --> 19:33.269
Okay.

19:33.649 --> 19:35.571
I have a picture of the fodder like this.

19:36.132 --> 19:38.535
I'm so unmechanical.

19:38.936 --> 19:43.942
This is kind of every so often.

19:44.162 --> 19:46.465
Oh, it's my...

19:46.732 --> 19:52.722
I'll have plenty of time.

19:52.742 --> 19:55.005
Question 65.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.950
Question 65.

19:58.090 --> 19:58.791
Question 65.

19:58.871 --> 20:00.213
Sono tipografi di origine tedesca.

20:00.294 --> 20:01.576
SÃ¬, sÃ¬.

20:01.596 --> 20:03.058
SÃ¬, stanno a lontano.

20:03.459 --> 20:08.807
Ho scritto sulla biblioteca di Subbiato, ovviamente, poi gli mando...

20:08.956 --> 20:17.144
This is one of the 300 exemplars that were made in alto-bianco.

20:17.164 --> 20:24.390
And the most beautiful thing is that the alto-bianco was to find the alto-bianco.

20:24.410 --> 20:27.913
Then they found the alto-bianco.

20:28.114 --> 20:32.377
Then they found the alto-bianco.

20:32.438 --> 20:34.299
Then they found the alto-bianco.

20:34.559 --> 20:38.423
Then they found the alto-bianco.

20:38.656 --> 20:41.121
So they had, they were going to put it in the chat.

20:41.141 --> 20:43.947
So they had, they were going to put it in the chat.

20:43.967 --> 20:49.199
So they had, they were going to put it in the chat.

20:49.219 --> 20:52.125
So they had, they were going to put it in the chat.

20:52.510 --> 20:57.396
They have some empty books.

20:57.436 --> 21:03.384
They have some empty books to write in Greek.

21:03.985 --> 21:08.972
Yes, for free.

21:09.853 --> 21:13.017
Just what I understand.

21:12.997 --> 21:41.113
I thought that it was Aldous Minutius who printed the paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper paper

21:41.650 --> 22:02.899
This is like a work in progress because I didn't put in all the Greeks.

22:03.065 --> 22:13.575
I guess it's Minucius who printed the first book totally.

22:14.916 --> 22:22.963
Because first they printed the Latin and then they had to insert, they printed, they put it back in the printing press to put it in the green.

22:22.983 --> 22:27.687
Ask him, have they always had this copy of this book?

22:27.747 --> 22:32.852
Did they acquire it when it was printed?

22:33.254 --> 22:40.743
It came as soon as it was, because this was, that was a Benedictine.

22:40.803 --> 22:42.084
The same order.

22:42.525 --> 22:43.726
The same order.

22:43.806 --> 22:46.149
So they always had it?

22:46.349 --> 22:48.932
Yes, always had it.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.294
That's wonderful.

22:50.314 --> 22:50.554
Yes.

22:50.674 --> 22:55.400
Ask if we could see the coliform at the back.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.924
Ah, the coliform.

23:00.997 --> 23:09.224
This is originale, this is copied from another one.

23:09.304 --> 23:09.565
Ah, yes.

23:09.585 --> 23:10.425
So, you see?

23:10.445 --> 23:13.648
1460, you see?

23:16.151 --> 23:16.291
Mm-hmm.

23:18.172 --> 23:20.194
Ah, yes, yes.

23:20.254 --> 23:21.415
This is modern?

23:21.936 --> 23:22.356
Yes, yes, yes.

23:22.376 --> 23:25.679
But the originality is this.

23:25.899 --> 23:26.500
Ah, yes.

23:26.580 --> 23:27.080
Yes.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.542
But the 1460, you see?

23:28.682 --> 23:29.923
Yes, yes.

23:30.241 --> 23:37.951
There's a name in French there too.

23:37.971 --> 23:43.819
Monasteris Venerable Monasteris Brescian.

23:43.859 --> 23:44.660
No, no.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.302
No, no.

23:46.943 --> 23:59.860
No, I'm sorry, I'm going to give it away.

24:00.886 --> 24:23.265
He went to take the manuscripts to the splendors of Byzantium.

24:23.431 --> 24:27.356
We saw that exhibition.

24:27.376 --> 24:29.078
We saw that exhibition.

24:29.258 --> 24:33.423
It was wonderful.

24:33.443 --> 24:36.286
Oh, it was a wonderful exhibition.

24:36.366 --> 24:37.367
Wonderful.

24:38.889 --> 24:40.811
We have the catalog.

24:42.593 --> 24:51.784
We have the catalog at home.

24:52.608 --> 25:11.968
The Greek Patriarch of the opening of the exhibition.

25:12.109 --> 25:15.212
They were manuscripts.

25:15.592 --> 25:20.117
They were manuscripts, but the first time they came from Montiato.

25:20.350 --> 25:37.673
Two manuscripts that he brought had the Byzantine illumination.

25:38.474 --> 25:49.328
I love how you do that.

25:49.510 --> 26:06.396
They were insured for 20 million dollars each.

26:06.616 --> 26:12.565
Which books?

26:13.068 --> 26:23.741
The catalog of the Incunabulus.

26:23.761 --> 26:33.693
Around 300 Incunabulus they have here.

26:33.934 --> 26:39.160
He's going to show us the manuscript.

26:40.118 --> 26:46.024
Ma qui puÃ² entrare, diciamo, se viene uno studioso?

26:46.164 --> 26:54.473
E' solo lei che puÃ² venire a prendere la tante, perchÃ© la signora non lo vogliono.

26:54.493 --> 27:03.482
SÃ¬, per il momento non Ã¨ ancora piÃ¹.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.065
No, ma diciamo che qui i lettori non possono entrare.

27:06.145 --> 27:07.847
SÃ¬, ma in genere sono qui alla prima volta.

27:08.047 --> 27:16.752
But when will it be?

27:16.772 --> 27:17.214
Yes, it will be.

27:17.234 --> 27:20.082
It will be.

27:21.007 --> 27:37.729
He doesn't know what's going to happen.

27:38.310 --> 27:44.398
From the end of the 17th century.

27:44.378 --> 27:47.763
Ah, Warburg.

27:49.747 --> 28:00.764
Warburg, sorry.

28:02.788 --> 28:11.061
The library now in England said that

28:11.547 --> 28:27.025
A book is a book but two books at the beginning of the library.

28:27.005 --> 28:42.195
I had a lot of money, I had a lot of money, I had a lot of money, I had a lot of money, I had a lot of money, I had a lot of money.

28:42.175 --> 28:46.820
who lived some years in Italy.

28:46.860 --> 28:57.371
Then, with the war, they saved the time, because in the 1936, the biblioteca was already being attacked by the Nazis.

28:58.032 --> 28:59.514
They were dead.

28:59.534 --> 29:00.475
They were dead.

29:00.515 --> 29:01.696
They were dead.

29:01.716 --> 29:02.337
They were dead.

29:02.537 --> 29:04.800
They were dead.

29:04.820 --> 29:05.280
They were dead.

29:05.615 --> 29:18.435
The Warburg Library, I haven't seen it, it was the beginning of the Quirclean Institute, but I'm not too sure.

29:19.597 --> 29:21.840
I wrote the books in January.

29:21.940 --> 29:31.555
Yes, it's the first old book.

29:32.885 --> 29:48.210
It's a word that used to say that

29:48.427 --> 30:07.610
People who love books should be tractable, so you should let them use the library and open stacks.

30:08.331 --> 30:17.522
Thank you.

30:23.442 --> 30:29.111
When they were here, who was there?

30:29.371 --> 30:31.334
They wanted to see if there were any tracks.

30:31.394 --> 30:32.736
Yes, that's why they met.

30:32.756 --> 30:36.923
When they were so far.

30:37.083 --> 30:51.205
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you.

30:51.910 --> 31:06.309
We should meet him in front of the church.

31:06.890 --> 31:17.985
He was called like a wet blanket, this man, by foretelling this, for writing this account, because they didn't...

31:18.758 --> 31:21.344
What was he called that?

31:21.925 --> 31:25.973
Because he said the truth.

31:26.074 --> 31:34.953
He speaks about how it was bombed.

31:35.915 --> 31:39.282
The author of the bomb.

31:39.937 --> 31:51.450
He came from the New Zealand... Who were the closest allies to the... Oh, okay.

31:51.530 --> 31:59.499
So the New Zealanders told General Alexander that the Germans were inside the army.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.742
He said they weren't inside the army.

32:02.903 --> 32:25.519
He says that the New Zealanders

32:25.837 --> 32:35.268
It's sad that the Germans were inside the abbey and said they weren't inside the abbey.

32:37.651 --> 32:44.359
That's important.

32:44.479 --> 32:47.102
C'Ã¨ questo libro qui, anche in italiano?

32:47.167 --> 33:13.039
... ... ... ... ... ...

33:13.492 --> 33:14.073
Belmont.

33:14.673 --> 33:16.115
Belmont.

33:16.395 --> 33:16.836
Belmont.

33:16.936 --> 33:18.057
Belmont.

33:18.458 --> 33:19.559
Belmont.

33:19.659 --> 33:20.179
Belmont.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.703
Belmont.

33:23.723 --> 33:24.164
Belmont.

33:24.244 --> 33:25.425
Belmont.

33:25.465 --> 33:26.026
Belmont.

33:26.447 --> 33:27.147
Belmont.

33:28.889 --> 33:31.252
Belmont.

33:31.813 --> 33:32.613
Belmont.

33:33.074 --> 33:34.556
Belmont.

33:35.076 --> 33:35.837
Belmont.

33:38.200 --> 33:38.520
Belmont.

33:39.277 --> 33:41.400
There it is, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

33:41.460 --> 34:00.443
He says if you go to, if you call him and go to visit him, you can bring him greetings and you could talk to him about when he was here.

34:00.523 --> 34:04.828
He wrote, he books about when he was here.

34:04.808 --> 34:07.332
It's a post-bizantina in 1066.

34:07.352 --> 34:09.775
There are all the inscriptions that we have.

34:09.855 --> 34:12.299
When we go, we see them.

34:12.419 --> 34:20.130
There are three volumes published in the book.

34:20.150 --> 34:26.800
There are a lot of articles in the book.

34:27.218 --> 34:31.224
That sounds fascinating.

34:31.805 --> 34:34.869
Very nice.

34:35.089 --> 34:40.718
He fights you several times.

34:46.206 --> 34:49.851
Thank you.

34:50.810 --> 35:05.050
I want his address because I want to send him a book.

35:05.071 --> 35:05.171
Sure.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.763
Thank you.

35:14.063 --> 35:26.899
Ask them if when they rebuilt, did they try and use many of the bolts of the stones?

35:27.300 --> 35:41.978
This is really something.

35:42.228 --> 35:53.708
So they used what was still usable.

35:54.349 --> 35:59.197
So I'm using them.

35:59.638 --> 36:05.788
Oh.

36:05.768 --> 36:12.904
These are the melodies, the diary of those.

36:13.004 --> 36:23.929
In the monastery there were...

36:24.348 --> 36:52.667
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

36:52.647 --> 37:20.950
So this was a notice to warn the people inside the Abbey that the Abbey...

37:20.930 --> 37:26.178
In the, I'll show you in the upper zone.

37:26.198 --> 37:27.520
In the night, the day before.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.342
Ah, get out of here.

37:29.442 --> 37:31.265
Oh, these are these ones.

37:31.285 --> 37:32.206
These are these ones.

37:32.306 --> 37:40.158
And I'll be talking with the... They dropped away, but they said we're going to bomb it.

37:40.318 --> 37:45.165
Yeah, but the addict who got one of them.

37:45.145 --> 38:06.597
So, the night after the farming, the abyss rose.

38:06.762 --> 38:23.303
I have a question for you, if you have a question for me, if you have a question for me, I have a question for you.

38:23.587 --> 38:27.671
Yes, yes, yes.

38:29.633 --> 38:41.605
Oh, you knew that the abbey was when the 12th went at the bottom, but there were 12 months in the abbey.

38:42.025 --> 38:44.047
And they were killed.

38:44.608 --> 38:45.329
And they were killed.

38:45.389 --> 38:48.592
And they were killed.

38:49.913 --> 38:53.577
And they were killed.

38:53.557 --> 38:58.420
for 20, 20, 20, 20, 20.

38:58.771 --> 39:10.085
So, there were a lot of civilians here, and they had a lot of civilians here.

39:10.145 --> 39:28.508
They had a lot of civilians here, and they had a lot of civilians here, and they had a lot of civilians here, and they had a lot of civilians here, and they had a lot of civilians here.

39:30.023 --> 39:33.244
I didn't want to stand on my stairs.

39:33.264 --> 39:36.062
What do I do?

39:36.666 --> 39:36.726
Oh.

39:39.035 --> 40:04.080
I just want to get a picture like this.

40:05.309 --> 40:13.322
His words are explained in the bottom of the screen.

40:13.342 --> 40:19.272
It seems very anxious.

40:21.095 --> 40:26.904
It really does.

40:26.924 --> 40:26.984
OK.

40:27.004 --> 40:30.410
OK.

40:30.430 --> 40:30.490
OK.

40:35.330 --> 40:45.583
Because you can understand all this, I want to look at it.

40:45.603 --> 40:57.237
1940s, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to, I need to.

40:58.364 --> 41:08.137
The 14th October 1942, two Dutch officials say that they have to go to the market.

41:08.918 --> 41:17.149
Five days after the 19th October, the Dutch already organized the first coups.

41:17.450 --> 41:26.681
This is the colonel in Austriaco.

41:26.721 --> 41:39.677
This is the colonel in Austriaco.

41:41.580 --> 41:41.820
Yes.

41:42.880 --> 41:47.031
Here are the days of the start of the monarchy.

41:47.051 --> 41:48.815
Where are you going?

41:49.196 --> 41:50.379
I'm going to Luma.

41:50.920 --> 41:58.359
There are various monasteries in San Paolo, San Santermo, San Chirolamo, Aurelia, San Dapraselli.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.843
They are going to Luma.

41:59.823 --> 42:28.480
and while all the bibliotheca and the archivio are brought to school, then you can see the great pictures and then you can see the great pictures and then you can see the great pictures

42:28.865 --> 42:31.088
This is the post of all the cacchetti.

42:31.168 --> 42:38.679
So, I'll try to see if they can salvage their lives.

42:38.699 --> 42:58.686
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

42:59.510 --> 43:06.869
These are the gombi of the monastery, these are the pellegrini.

43:08.232 --> 43:10.678
Signora, can you do this?

43:10.738 --> 43:12.964
8 Vicente.

43:12.984 --> 43:16.573
8 Vicente.

43:16.756 --> 43:23.866
L'Archino viene portato da Spoleto in Vaticano, a Casa del San D'Angelo, perÃ².

43:23.886 --> 43:25.449
Adrian Stone.

43:25.569 --> 43:30.736
Allora, signora, allora bisogna dire, perchÃ© Ã¨ Cristo?

43:30.756 --> 43:33.861
Questa Ã¨ una domanda, un problema.

43:35.043 --> 43:44.957
Spoleto viene fuori per Roma, quindi il motivo per che l'hanno portato da Spoleto Ã¨ perchÃ© se rimane ancora, ancora... No.

43:45.764 --> 43:55.897
The archivist, when he went to Rome, he was the first part of the photograph.

43:56.037 --> 44:02.184
This is the first part of the decision.

44:02.244 --> 44:12.497
He went to Rome and went to Rome and he informed the Secretariat of the State.

44:12.697 --> 44:30.021
They have informed the Italian government that had been in custody of all of them, and that if they had put in motion a machine, they could be able to save their children.

44:30.041 --> 44:36.730
They had obtained an inspection, and that is the reason why,

44:36.710 --> 44:54.769
How does the German mean?

44:54.749 --> 45:11.948
like there, the German Cultural Institute in Rome, went to Slado and wrote for her report, so that the Italian authorities would announce how important it was to say that right there,

45:11.928 --> 45:37.632
The Germans had a kind of storage area as well.

45:37.865 --> 46:03.467
You see, the Maffamondo is in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle

46:03.818 --> 46:10.365
In our monastery, these are 260 cars in Pallangio, from the Museum of Napoli.

46:10.405 --> 46:22.877
They were in the deposit here, before August 1943, in the deposit, the most beautiful square of the Museum of Napoli, the Capodermonde.

46:22.897 --> 46:26.000
And in the tedesco they went to Rome, right?

46:26.240 --> 46:28.763
Oh, so before they even stopped.

46:28.743 --> 46:34.235
They kept here, for safety, but that's works of art from Naples.

46:34.957 --> 46:44.577
And so the Germans took some of these also to Rome, you see, this one with a big, really big one.

46:44.597 --> 46:48.085
No, and then they took me to Germany, but works of art because...

46:48.065 --> 47:05.247
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

47:05.885 --> 47:21.632
She said it started in a certain way, even if they had taken them on the helmet.

47:21.612 --> 47:37.731
had sustained them instead of they survived and stayed here they would have again incinerated memories.

47:37.964 --> 47:44.875
Allora, signora, vede che piazza, Ã¨ ancora questa?

47:44.895 --> 47:53.830
Si ringraziano i tedeschi, questo Ã¨ uno solo funzionario del ministero, ebbene, sta ringraziando gli attenzionamenti dell'aiuto dato alla bidedeca.

47:53.810 --> 47:54.731
Yes.

47:55.072 --> 47:56.093
Yes.

47:57.315 --> 48:02.623
Yes.

48:02.743 --> 48:03.805
Yes.

48:07.250 --> 48:16.864
Yes.

48:16.844 --> 48:42.649
After, in general, how did you go?

48:42.629 --> 49:05.616
So in the German the party said that

49:05.917 --> 49:08.245
they would leave the last day.

49:08.305 --> 49:15.832
Those German soldiers ended the average 12 months and 60-parent farmers could take them.

49:15.852 --> 49:16.635
Well, I didn't know that.

49:17.138 --> 49:39.113
And there are no refugees because there is no more access.

49:39.093 --> 49:58.789
1500 inhabitants down there and had come up here.

49:58.769 --> 50:22.887
All right, so the 1500 thousand people that lived in the States were so cold that the Abbot that he can't live in the States, in the gravels, in the mountains, are really just coming in the Abbot.

50:23.322 --> 50:29.548
February, this is the situation terrible, because they have little bombs close to us.

50:29.568 --> 50:32.210
14-11, it's about 2 in the morning.

50:32.230 --> 50:35.974
14-11, there is a bomb in the garden, but it's all full of volantini.

50:36.394 --> 50:37.775
This is a volantini.

50:37.795 --> 50:44.361
All right, so they've got 6 stamps, so they've got to get them in charge.

50:44.461 --> 50:49.086
They say, let's get them in charge because we're going to get them in charge.

50:49.346 --> 50:52.789
Yes, we're going to get them in charge.

50:53.528 --> 51:17.275
And the next morning, the next morning, the next morning, the next morning, the next morning.

51:19.617 --> 51:28.230
But I think about the other one, the monastery and the water.

51:28.250 --> 51:30.914
This is a very difficult moment, you see?

51:30.934 --> 51:31.214
Yes.

51:31.975 --> 51:43.853
All right, the volantino, the base is here in the monastery, but there is a tunnel in the monastery, where there were still 600 people.

51:44.542 --> 52:06.786
Oh, okay, so...

52:06.766 --> 52:24.855
One of these 300 people still left brought this to the head of the abbot and said, why do you have this printed so that you're going to force us to leave?

52:25.817 --> 52:33.870
Because he didn't think, he didn't believe that it was the abbot who had done it.

52:33.850 --> 52:47.066
Fanno venire un giovane ufficiale tedesco per parlare con la base.

52:47.086 --> 52:50.189
E lui vede il volantino.

52:50.209 --> 52:56.136
E lui ha detto la veritÃ , non abbiamo notizie dei bombardamenti.

52:56.156 --> 53:03.385
PerÃ² adesso torno alla Princea e chiedo informazioni al comando tedesco.

53:03.955 --> 53:07.983
And I'll come back to the 5th.

53:08.043 --> 53:23.215
He said the truth, and he confirmed that we have had here, in the 10th century, a colonel americano, and that was the first pilot of the American bombardment.

53:23.415 --> 53:25.339
He had a lot of...

53:25.640 --> 53:33.170
So, it says that they know that they can come by one of the Americans in the palace.

53:33.931 --> 53:47.890
Yes, because the official is torn at the 5th of the morning, the 15th of February, before the bombardment, at the 5th of the morning, he is back to the monastery again, and he says that our commander has not captured the bombardment of the bombardment.

53:48.270 --> 53:49.572
And it is true, because

53:49.552 --> 54:03.273
This pilot American, written Evan, has brought us a copy of l'Ordine dei Giorni, Lavellina.

54:03.293 --> 54:15.492
He has ordered Evan, and shows... He has brought us, I don't know if we call him the Pentagon, but he says...

54:15.472 --> 54:25.312
So the pilots were told to leave whether they left them.

54:25.352 --> 54:35.252
It was so secret that they were only told

54:35.722 --> 54:40.629
Two hours before they... they say they were... I have a copy.

54:41.250 --> 54:43.172
I have a copy of this.

54:44.334 --> 54:48.580
Four hours before the bombing and the fire of it.

54:48.600 --> 54:53.607
The pilot is only one last week when he is the pilot.

54:53.627 --> 54:55.890
He has had a control of his body.

54:55.870 --> 55:21.338
They were part of an aeroplane with a military ally, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near Foggia, near

55:21.723 --> 55:29.057
And then how many factors are there?

55:29.878 --> 55:44.406
Some of them are out of the night, but at the moment of the comportment, there are only 300 people here.

55:44.386 --> 56:00.488
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:00.957 --> 56:05.022
This is a general, a general, a very good friend.

56:05.483 --> 56:07.605
This is a general, a very good friend.

56:08.787 --> 56:13.833
This is a general, a very good friend.

56:13.853 --> 56:17.317
This is a general, very good friend.

56:17.377 --> 56:20.061
This is a general, very good friend.

56:20.081 --> 56:23.665
This is a general, very good friend.

56:23.685 --> 56:24.646
This is a general, very good friend.

56:24.666 --> 56:25.988
This is a general, very good friend.

56:26.168 --> 56:27.069
This is a general, very good friend.

56:27.470 --> 56:28.832
This is a general, very good friend.

56:28.852 --> 56:30.053
This is a general, very good friend.

56:30.033 --> 56:52.007
... ... ... ... ...

56:53.877 --> 56:56.520
I'd love to know what they had in mind.

56:57.280 --> 56:58.682
Yeah, why, why?

56:58.722 --> 57:04.367
What were they trying to prove?

57:04.427 --> 57:11.233
Well, in some way... This is important.

57:11.254 --> 57:13.816
Signora, this is a photo storica.

57:13.836 --> 57:16.478
Vede dove Ã¨ inserisciato?

57:18.120 --> 57:20.222
E' lontano e l'uomo la stessa.

57:22.025 --> 57:32.997
So only the freedom gets to go and die.

57:33.466 --> 57:45.685
When we had published this memory of the Monachy, it was in the diary that they made the Monachy.

57:46.627 --> 57:56.082
When I was ready to write about it, our host, our old school, our old school,

57:56.062 --> 58:03.753
He was an ambassador to Stamacca, in this moment he was an ambassador to Moscow.

58:03.913 --> 58:07.278
He was a very good family from Sicilia.

58:07.378 --> 58:10.642
He was in pension.

58:10.662 --> 58:14.007
He came here for a week as a host.

58:14.027 --> 58:16.230
He told me to read his memory.

58:16.210 --> 58:20.796
They can't split hair.

58:21.597 --> 58:26.364
They had someone made the magazine.

58:26.384 --> 58:35.476
Yeah, but the Germans were up on the mountain.

58:35.516 --> 58:45.930
They weren't inside the monastery, but they were a hundred meters from here.

58:45.910 --> 58:47.994
But the Germans were here.

58:48.014 --> 58:49.596
Not inside.

58:49.677 --> 58:51.700
Not inside the building.

58:51.720 --> 59:07.868
SÃ¬, comunque i tedeschi sopra la montagna c'erano, solo che non era da dentro la... SÃ¬, perÃ² signore il problema Ã¨ che si dovevano andare a Roma, non Ã¨ che dovevano andare, non dovevano andare a Monte Cassino.

59:23.423 --> 59:53.194
The Germans had made the salt of the mortals to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able

59:53.174 --> 01:00:11.875
Yeah, if they had done a joint push from Amzio, if they had moved immediately from Amzio, moved here, the Germans,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:17.809
would never have been able to resist, but that's kind of theoretical.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:27.423
Clark didn't want to bomb Casino, he says, but Alexander did.

01:00:28.505 --> 01:00:30.488
That Alexander was terrible.
