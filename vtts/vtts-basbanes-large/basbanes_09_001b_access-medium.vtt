WEBVTT

00:04.739 --> 00:06.041
Okay, say that again.

00:06.061 --> 00:09.867
Academics, pimps and fosterers who are educated beyond their intelligence.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.170
And I've really come to dislike them.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.252
I think they're overpaid.

00:13.592 --> 00:16.637
And I really don't think they're genuine.

00:17.418 --> 00:25.430
Nowadays, I think academics, and I'm talking about even the best schools have at MIT year where I've taught, they see teaching as a trade, not a mission.

00:26.231 --> 00:29.536
But the old guy, and they're pedantic.

00:29.556 --> 00:33.582
And Yale, I mean, oh, you should see the, you know,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.463
Well, I have a theory that a lot of critics want to be writers.

00:37.004 --> 00:45.314
So what they have done in the deconstruction world, in the semiology, is actually, they've become the own, they know more about Moby Dick than Melville.

00:45.334 --> 00:48.998
What Melville didn't know, they say, was what I know.

00:49.699 --> 00:51.782
And the students revere this.

00:51.862 --> 00:52.783
Oh yeah, they're gold.

00:53.464 --> 00:59.451
But the old guy, the old guy's like, well, the people that put together that Riverside Shakespeare, Gwyn Evans, and, yeah.

01:00.005 --> 01:06.853
Well, I get a lot, and I just wanted to get back, and because I get a lot in that misogynist library, I get a wonderful help from that, to do that.

01:07.614 --> 01:09.115
And so you get a kick out of it.

01:10.056 --> 01:16.043
I don't mean exhaustive, but I get some really astonishing, it's about five pages.

01:16.924 --> 01:21.049
And that's the kind of thing that they were, you know, a double-digit, oh my God, do you want to cut that?

01:21.189 --> 01:22.651
No, I don't want to cut that.

01:22.911 --> 01:25.073
Do you want to cut the Ithaca chapter from Ulysses?

01:26.175 --> 01:26.535
You know?

01:26.903 --> 01:29.667
Not that I'm making that... How did that book do, by the way, commercially?

01:30.007 --> 01:30.949
Darkinville's Cat?

01:30.969 --> 01:31.530
Yeah.

01:31.550 --> 01:36.937
It never was published in paperback, and it's the only book of the Burgess 99 that never was.

01:37.438 --> 01:38.600
It's amazing.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.601
Sad.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.083
But here's what I want to say about the primary colors.

01:41.284 --> 01:45.930
It really is a making of... Do you have an agent that's tried to... Well, we're going to do that.

01:45.991 --> 01:47.433
We might try to do that in the fall.

01:47.453 --> 01:50.958
Wouldn't Vintage, wouldn't Marty Asher, or would Vintage bring something like that out?

01:50.978 --> 01:53.662
My agent's working on it, yeah.

01:53.682 --> 01:55.324
But I just wanted to say that that...

01:55.912 --> 02:09.472
primary colors under the rubric of red, no pun intended, good title though, rubric of red, you know, rubric, yeah, does have that compilation, does have that idea of gathering, under this one umbrella, the many.

02:10.373 --> 02:16.703
And that's wonderful, and that's why if you have that zeal to do that, no book is ever close to finished.

02:17.244 --> 02:24.214
You always have to see another character could have said this, because there are people that finish their books and put pages, and I have a tendency to do it with my novel,

02:24.430 --> 02:26.793
But this is the first non-fiction book I've ever published.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.199
And I can see why, oh, I hate to read it.

02:30.239 --> 02:32.702
Do you have a sense of trepidation seeing it out there as such?

02:32.902 --> 02:33.884
None, no.

02:34.885 --> 02:42.036
I'd like to see it do well, but I had ambitions for my other books, and they're just not beach books.

02:43.238 --> 02:44.359
Do you remember Richard Yates?

02:44.880 --> 02:45.501
I loved him.

02:46.142 --> 02:47.504
Y-A-T-E-S?

02:47.524 --> 02:48.786
Yeah, he lived in Boston.

02:50.769 --> 02:51.730
Wonderful novelist.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.952
I remember asking him...

02:53.506 --> 02:55.968
Boy, if I knew how to write it, he was a writer's writer.

02:56.008 --> 02:56.269
Yeah.

02:56.309 --> 02:58.130
Eleven kinds of loneliness.

02:58.851 --> 02:59.492
Yeah.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.573
What the hell was the other one?

03:00.613 --> 03:01.734
I've never read any of this.

03:01.814 --> 03:04.516
Revolutionary Road was his famous novel.

03:04.536 --> 03:05.437
He's a little boss.

03:05.457 --> 03:05.998
He died.

03:06.178 --> 03:07.760
He had all kinds of problems.

03:08.340 --> 03:11.363
He said, if I knew how to write a bestseller, I'd do it in a second.

03:11.383 --> 03:12.544
Yeah.

03:12.924 --> 03:13.925
But it's hard to predict.

03:13.945 --> 03:14.606
But you can't.

03:14.626 --> 03:15.907
Yeah, it's hard to predict.

03:15.927 --> 03:18.730
You know, we have brilliant quotes in this book.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.852
This is a real interesting thing to mention.

03:20.912 --> 03:23.074
In terms of the rocket ship.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.776
The rocket ship is there.

03:24.816 --> 03:26.278
They're publishing a flyer.

03:26.378 --> 03:27.379
Alan will probably send you one.

03:27.399 --> 03:29.822
I'm sure he'll send you one, or I'll give him.

03:29.843 --> 03:38.554
But we have major remarks from Updike, Robertson, Davies, Annie Proulx, who won the National Booker, James McCourt.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.458
And the Pulitzer, I think.

03:41.498 --> 03:41.779
Yeah.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.684
And now they could, you know, a lot of times publishers can make a vessel.

03:45.704 --> 03:46.906
They can really push this.

03:47.226 --> 03:48.147
Full page in New York Times.

03:48.488 --> 03:51.492
But there's a strange...

03:52.906 --> 03:58.914
crossing of Karen into the underworld, and you're not sure what takes place in that crossover.

03:59.515 --> 04:13.013
So I say that book could go right into the drink and be reviewed in short takes in the New York Times, get no attention, and drop dead, or it could become a bestseller and the first non-fiction bestseller list.

04:13.033 --> 04:18.120
That's how much faith I have in the non-serendipitous

04:18.809 --> 04:20.211
reading world.

04:20.231 --> 04:22.534
It's the kind of book that can really take off on college campuses.

04:23.515 --> 04:25.118
But I'm talking about real big sales.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.900
I'm talking about if they pushed it.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.964
In many ways, publishers can make a bestseller.

04:30.004 --> 04:38.155
But then on the other hand, they've gone oftentimes with major pushes, and the book has gone into the drink.

04:38.175 --> 04:45.045
Like this Bridges of Madison County, bad as it was, that was a small printing, and that thing went and took off.

04:45.325 --> 04:47.348
It's one of the great mysteries of

04:47.783 --> 04:50.546
the last 25 years of publishing it.

04:50.626 --> 04:51.247
To me it is.

04:51.327 --> 04:51.787
I've read it.

04:51.807 --> 04:52.348
Have you read it?

04:52.869 --> 04:54.290
No, I couldn't.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.291
It's impenetrable.

04:55.431 --> 04:57.474
This is in the other direction.

04:57.554 --> 05:02.059
A totally vapid work as far as I'm concerned.

05:02.099 --> 05:10.368
There's one guy in the New Yorker said, there's not a line in it that couldn't have made a lyric sung by the Carpenters.

05:11.829 --> 05:17.115
Did you see the review of John Gregory Dunn's novel in the New York Times the other day?

05:17.686 --> 05:19.449
his new novel of Atlantic City.

05:19.530 --> 05:20.171
No, I didn't.

05:20.371 --> 05:21.914
But he said, there's one funny line.

05:21.974 --> 05:30.251
He said, have you ever noticed that every poem, every Emily Dickinson poem, you could sing it to the music of the Yellow Rose of Texas?

05:30.912 --> 05:32.455
Yeah, I did see that.

05:32.671 --> 05:35.895
And then he gave an example, and it was funny.

05:35.915 --> 05:37.116
That's right.

05:37.156 --> 05:39.339
I thought, I remember reading, I didn't know what that was in there.

05:39.359 --> 05:39.799
I didn't read that.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.660
I thought that was hilarious.

05:40.921 --> 05:45.186
And by the way, I then in my mind went through about four poems, and almost every one.

05:45.266 --> 05:46.667
Every one you could tell.

05:46.687 --> 05:51.433
After great pain, after great pain, a formal feeling comes.

05:51.493 --> 05:53.035
Yeah, every one.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.737
Yeah, La Rose of Texas.

05:54.757 --> 05:55.618
Yeah, that's right.

05:55.638 --> 05:59.863
Yeah, after great pain, a formal feeling comes.

06:01.365 --> 06:02.526
That's funny.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.275
Of course, she's more than her metrics, that's what he didn't mention.

06:07.295 --> 06:09.357
You wrote your name, Emily, here, several times.

06:09.377 --> 06:28.783
Yeah, as I said, this is a reflection of a lot of my taste, and that's an important point for me, because my personal ambition was to not, although I mentioned, only in a few instances, what's that guy from the 60s, Watermelon Sugar, Brodigan, the guy that killed himself, he's a trash head, but I mentioned him a couple of times, and I noticed I mentioned him about three times.

06:28.949 --> 06:32.177
So people are going to think, oh, he likes Proust and Brautigan.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.803
But actually, I don't think I've even read Brautigan.

06:34.943 --> 06:37.810
I think I hoovered those up somewhere.

06:38.071 --> 06:41.319
When you were doing this, I mean, were you alert to them?

06:41.339 --> 06:44.146
You'd see something on green, you'd see something on yellow.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.409
Pull over the side of the road.

06:45.429 --> 06:46.030
You really would.

06:46.229 --> 06:49.032
You're constantly jotting things down.

06:49.052 --> 06:49.633
Yeah, pretty much.

06:49.673 --> 06:53.237
And I picked the brains of friends of mine.

06:53.257 --> 06:56.381
I wrote Annie Dillard and asked her, do you have any, you know.

06:56.681 --> 06:57.422
But it's surprising.

06:57.462 --> 07:01.327
People, again, people, I love the challenge.

07:01.387 --> 07:07.194
I love the challenge of coming up with an observation.

07:07.214 --> 07:10.078
A lot of people didn't, you know, help me that way.

07:10.718 --> 07:14.683
Well, I mean, you mentioned the volcano of 91, you know,

07:15.085 --> 07:16.867
gave us those sunsets.

07:17.348 --> 07:19.771
Tim O'Brien's new book is all about pink.

07:19.971 --> 07:26.659
I'm doing my first piece for Minneapolis.

07:27.199 --> 07:29.362
It's going to take me once a month starting.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.763
That's great.

07:30.964 --> 07:35.509
Tim O'Brien's... Is this the guy that wrote... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:35.709 --> 07:36.670
I never did read that book.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.412
It won the National Book Award.

07:38.432 --> 07:38.933
I love this.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.574
Is that about Vietnam?

07:41.594 --> 07:42.876
Yeah, and he said he's done.

07:43.016 --> 07:47.783
He's 47 years old, and he said, I don't believe him.

07:47.803 --> 07:49.105
I think he's going through a personal crisis.

07:49.125 --> 07:52.930
The thing is, I like to see people, though, that don't have this play every tournament.

07:53.071 --> 07:56.055
My brother Paul writes a book here.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.577
Let's talk about that at some point.

07:57.957 --> 08:01.683
I mean, if you don't mind giving me a couple of graphs on the family thingy, I think that's okay.

08:01.703 --> 08:03.705
No, it's overplayed.

08:03.725 --> 08:04.727
I love my family.

08:04.867 --> 08:07.671
It's a talented family of writers.

08:08.326 --> 08:13.391
It's interesting in our family, everybody has a different style.

08:13.411 --> 08:16.413
Like my brother Peter and I, he was in Time magazine, did you see that?

08:17.434 --> 08:19.997
He has a new book called Translating L.A.

08:20.938 --> 08:25.001
This is my youngest brother Peter, Random House.

08:27.183 --> 08:31.467
So we all have different styles, writing styles, and go down different highways.

08:32.148 --> 08:36.392
But I'm from a very talkative family, and you sound like you might be too.

08:36.693 --> 08:42.078
Yeah, yeah.

08:42.178 --> 08:51.047
You know, my friend Chris Lydon always says that we're from the, he calls us the Flying Wallendus, we got to Medford, Massachusetts, but the Flying Wallendus was the circus.

08:51.067 --> 08:58.254
Yeah, well, it must have been a very active house though, you must have really encouraged the imagination.

08:58.274 --> 09:01.958
It was, my parents were very good like that when we were growing up.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.764
They were people that actually wanted a big family.

09:05.784 --> 09:06.665
There were seven kids.

09:07.145 --> 09:08.347
They wanted a big family.

09:09.047 --> 09:19.338
My father, you know, that cheaper-by-the-dozen syndrome of the father that every Sunday would take us to a different historical place in Boston.

09:19.378 --> 09:23.123
We had whaling museums and South of the Seven Gables.

09:23.343 --> 09:28.148
When we were seven and eight, and then when we came back, he would like us to often ask us to write an essay about it.

09:29.039 --> 09:32.584
But I grew up valuing authors and not cowboys.

09:32.964 --> 09:49.787
I mean, I love Babe Ruth and Ted Williams and Sam Houston, but I had a book called 50 Famous Americans, and the authors in it imprinted on me as being the great, wonderful, you know, geniuses and admirable people.

09:49.807 --> 09:51.930
To be an author, to write with a quill.

09:51.970 --> 09:56.957
I remember there was a picture of Washington Irving, a drawing of Washington Irving leaning on his finger.

09:57.617 --> 09:58.759
And I just, you know...

09:59.465 --> 10:06.975
Is there anything to be gleaned from your experience in the monastery, or is that just something that came in light?

10:07.256 --> 10:08.297
In terms of writing?

10:08.537 --> 10:10.080
Yeah, in terms of your development.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.383
Oh, it was central to my development.

10:12.623 --> 10:16.809
Is this something that you're talking about growing up loving writers?

10:17.169 --> 10:18.050
Yeah.

10:18.071 --> 10:19.953
But I didn't know about this, though.

10:19.973 --> 10:21.355
You clearly must have been...

10:21.638 --> 10:24.682
Well, I grew up in a Catholic house.

10:24.702 --> 10:25.563
A life of meditation.

10:25.843 --> 10:26.964
Well, no, not really.

10:27.285 --> 10:30.168
Maybe it was to get away from all the noise in my house.

10:30.188 --> 10:33.312
No, we grew up in a Catholic family.

10:33.352 --> 10:34.714
None of us went to parochial schools.

10:34.754 --> 10:36.896
I think my sister, one of my sisters maybe did.

10:37.417 --> 10:38.558
We went to public schools.

10:38.999 --> 10:41.441
No, I had read Thomas Merton on my own.

10:42.423 --> 10:46.027
My mother actually gave me a copy of it, but then read it and was impressed.

10:46.047 --> 10:48.109
And after high school, made some retreats out there.

10:48.650 --> 10:50.312
But it was central to my...

10:51.305 --> 11:09.903
and development in that they were the paradigm of goodness, those monks, and still stand for me as the high-water mark of, you know, civilized and spiritual and dedicated human beings, although there were some strange fellows in there, but for the most part it was a very touching experience.

11:09.963 --> 11:13.346
And did you expect to join their ranks?

11:13.366 --> 11:14.587
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.489
This is how you... I was a novice.

11:16.729 --> 11:17.910
...intended to spend your life?

11:18.170 --> 11:18.811
Absolutely.

11:19.372 --> 11:20.873
Yeah, I was a novice, and by the way,

11:21.140 --> 11:29.973
It was only, I started writing in there, I started writing rather bad poetry, and not that some people would say it still continues, but... How old were you, or what?

11:29.993 --> 11:30.694
I was 17.

11:30.714 --> 11:31.716
And how long were you there?

11:31.736 --> 11:32.737
A couple of years.

11:33.238 --> 11:33.499
Okay.

11:34.821 --> 11:35.802
Yeah.

11:35.822 --> 11:38.406
But I started writing in there, and when I left there, I actually...

11:38.808 --> 11:41.531
And cross on, that's something I wanted to do.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.673
You know, Freud taught... Oh, yeah.

11:43.793 --> 11:44.614
Medford High School.

11:44.634 --> 11:46.015
And then you went to the monastery.

11:46.035 --> 11:46.315
Right.

11:46.416 --> 11:47.977
And did the family try to stop you?

11:47.997 --> 11:50.560
No, well, my mother and father always wanted us to do what we wanted.

11:50.620 --> 11:53.603
No, they were... I think they were sad that I was leaving.

11:54.864 --> 12:04.654
But, you know, there's this idea that Freud said that we... You know, the first four wishes we have are really central to everything.

12:04.674 --> 12:08.157
You know, the rosebud idea of Citizen Kane.

12:08.963 --> 12:16.109
And I always had that kind of interest in that monastic, I mean, things that I had read when I was a little kid.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.633
But it really wasn't for me.

12:19.653 --> 12:22.796
I've never married, but I've since wanted to marry.

12:22.836 --> 12:26.899
But after I left there, I went to the Franciscans, you know, missionary.

12:26.979 --> 12:32.524
I was there for two and a half years and was interested in becoming a priest, but then I didn't.

12:33.505 --> 12:36.608
How about, and then why don't you just finish it off the background?

12:36.976 --> 12:41.362
Your education, I guess, you've got a PhD in... Yeah, a PhD in English.

12:41.743 --> 12:43.385
UVA, Virginia.

12:43.686 --> 12:44.767
Yeah, that's how you know the Barrett.

12:44.787 --> 12:45.629
Clifton Waller Barrett.

12:46.610 --> 12:51.217
Well, I mean, I heard... I was there two years after Fulton came.

12:51.277 --> 12:54.461
I went there in 64, and there were great Fulton stories.

12:54.501 --> 13:03.895
In fact, you know, I just... Joe Blartner, you mentioned, I was just in Truro, visiting his daughter, who's in Wellesley, and I went and had dinner with him, and he...

13:05.360 --> 13:07.082
I hadn't seen him for 26 years.

13:07.803 --> 13:09.685
He was a teacher of mine in Virginia.

13:10.686 --> 13:15.212
And he got very negative reviews, and he was a very—he almost killed him.

13:15.312 --> 13:20.198
I think that's one of the great literary publications.

13:20.218 --> 13:26.485
Well, it's a wonderful—and by a former student, Paul Gray, at Time Magazine, you should see that review.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.907
It was an ad hominem attack.

13:29.249 --> 13:30.110
So I got a doctor.

13:30.350 --> 13:31.792
I quote it in my book.

13:31.852 --> 13:35.316
He has—let me just shut the video and take it.

13:35.498 --> 13:38.963
I was in touch with Styron.

13:38.983 --> 13:43.970
I'm trying to go to the American Academy in Rome for a year just to write in peace and get away.

13:45.352 --> 13:47.054
So I was looking for a copy of Sophie's Choice.

13:47.074 --> 13:51.099
I didn't care if it was a first edition of reading copy, a hardcover I wanted to give to this person.

13:51.119 --> 13:53.322
We had been talking about Styron.

13:53.383 --> 13:54.804
This is a sign of bookstores.

13:54.825 --> 13:56.687
I'm not going to go to any bookstores in the Cape.

13:57.008 --> 13:58.229
I'm sharing this thought with you.

13:58.329 --> 13:59.431
It's gossipy, though.

13:59.451 --> 14:00.833
I love gossip.

14:00.893 --> 14:04.678
I'll give you a few stories of my own.

14:04.827 --> 14:12.655
And so I went into, just as I was going into, Ben Mewes had a copy of Panassas.

14:13.556 --> 14:16.560
He opened a copy, and there were about 20 copies in the primary column.

14:16.580 --> 14:17.461
Oh, really?

14:17.481 --> 14:18.542
So this is right now?

14:18.562 --> 14:21.024
Yeah, it just happened, and he asked me to sign them.

14:21.044 --> 14:24.608
I don't like to sign books for just abstract, you know, to sell them.

14:24.628 --> 14:26.150
He's going to make a lot of money on them.

14:26.170 --> 14:30.294
I'm not saying that I'm, you know, Robert Lowell.

14:31.155 --> 14:32.657
So anyway, put them away, you know.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.699
Anyway, so I... Signing them does...

14:35.303 --> 14:36.184
They can't be returned.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.305
I couldn't give a shit.

14:37.725 --> 14:39.747
I honestly couldn't care if they were returned.

14:40.348 --> 14:42.690
And that's what he said, because he is so cheap.

14:43.151 --> 14:43.411
He is.

14:43.471 --> 14:48.136
He is so cheap, that rather than say, it would be an honor, I'd like to have them sign, and we'd value them.

14:48.396 --> 14:49.597
Well, he should do, then.

14:49.697 --> 14:50.958
Let me just say, have a knife for you.

14:50.978 --> 14:54.382
No, but what I'm saying, yeah, but Nick, instead, why don't I come to my punchline?

14:54.622 --> 14:59.066
Instead of saying, hey, look, Alex, these enhance the value of the book.

14:59.087 --> 15:01.829
I'm not, he said, we won't return them.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.151
Oh, fuck you.

15:04.152 --> 15:04.652
But anyway,

15:05.240 --> 15:06.262
Here's the punchline.

15:06.883 --> 15:10.168
He called me the next day.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.251
I'm not making this up.

15:14.995 --> 15:21.725
He said he had a copy of Sophie's Choice for $7.50 and I could come and get it.

15:22.306 --> 15:23.929
I said, aren't you going to send me the book?

15:23.949 --> 15:26.012
I just signed 18 copies or 20 copies of that.

15:26.212 --> 15:26.452
No.

15:26.853 --> 15:30.098
He didn't say no and hung up.

15:30.318 --> 15:31.701
That was five or six days ago.

15:31.721 --> 15:32.682
I've never got the book.

15:33.286 --> 15:34.808
Now there's a bookseller.

15:35.169 --> 15:37.913
And Nancy Titcombe, I want to just one other thing.

15:38.514 --> 15:46.306
I was asked to do an article for a magazine in which I was talking about how to get through the Cape inexpensively.

15:46.687 --> 15:53.197
And I mentioned in passing that only one bookseller in Provincetown ever gave me a discount.

15:53.217 --> 15:59.547
And Nancy Titcombe, I went in there with a guest, and it jumped into my face because I had done that.

16:00.016 --> 16:07.003
She could have called me aside and said, hey, but it was a rude, vulgar, vicious, unkind thing to do.

16:07.523 --> 16:08.765
And with about five other customers.

16:08.785 --> 16:09.325
So what did she do there?

16:09.586 --> 16:10.286
She said, look at this.

16:10.486 --> 16:11.908
You need, that reflects on you.

16:12.108 --> 16:13.930
I only gave a discount.

16:13.990 --> 16:19.135
It was published in this kind of like, you know, Cape Cod and $5 a day thing.

16:19.155 --> 16:19.656
Oh, I see.

16:19.676 --> 16:21.818
Oh, so you wrote this thing and she jumped on it.

16:21.838 --> 16:26.683
And she jumped, she had a couple, and I'll tell you something, that stupid bitch, I bet, has never read a book of mine.

16:26.943 --> 16:29.145
But what she did read was the column.

16:29.682 --> 16:36.977
And so, in other words, I guess the point I want to make, Nick, is, stridently, I'm fed up with booksellers, and they're pains in the ass.

16:37.238 --> 16:39.783
Nick's subject... I like to get a bill every once in a while.

16:39.803 --> 16:42.368
Well, no, and what you're doing is fun.

16:42.489 --> 16:44.272
I've made my scores of Ralph's.

16:44.533 --> 16:45.615
And Nick...

16:46.321 --> 16:50.987
But, Nick, what you do is what I do.

16:51.067 --> 16:54.352
I go to book stores, and that's interesting, that's a bargain, yeah.

16:54.372 --> 16:55.173
But I'll tell you something.

16:55.213 --> 16:56.394
I have no appetite to do it.

16:56.414 --> 16:59.358
I'd like to do this in Oregon, Idaho, and some other place.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.660
I've lived here too long.

17:01.080 --> 17:01.801
But I'll tell you something.

17:02.022 --> 17:09.712
They're parsimonious, they're unimaginative, they're gossipy, they're unkind, and worse, they're unjust and unfair.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.155
This has needed to do with it.

17:12.175 --> 17:12.636
You're angry.

17:12.976 --> 17:13.797
I am angry.

17:14.553 --> 17:15.874
I think that they're one way.

17:16.015 --> 17:17.056
It's a pathetic thing.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.678
It's a pathetic thing.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.700
And I will never sign any books for him.

17:21.060 --> 17:24.364
I'm not trying to say either by... Did you sign, by the way, all those books?

17:24.384 --> 17:28.328
Yeah, I signed all the books, and he didn't even thank me.

17:28.409 --> 17:32.053
In his view, he's doing you a favor.

17:32.113 --> 17:34.615
Believe me, he thinks it, and he's a bullshit artist.

17:34.816 --> 17:38.500
He knows he's not doing me a favor, but that's his persona.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.841
That's his mask.

17:41.663 --> 17:43.125
Well, go in there tomorrow.

17:43.358 --> 17:44.719
Just go in there tomorrow.

17:44.799 --> 17:47.382
Nick, go in there tomorrow and say that we talk about our interview.

17:47.402 --> 17:47.942
I'd like to know.

17:48.182 --> 17:49.123
We're doing an interview.

17:49.143 --> 17:50.445
And say, I want to buy five.

17:50.545 --> 17:51.165
They're signed.

17:51.866 --> 17:53.207
I'll sign five for you if you want.

17:53.227 --> 17:55.069
But I'm just saying, if you go in there.

17:55.089 --> 17:56.110
I wrote one to be signed.

17:56.130 --> 17:57.151
All right, Nick, but if he.

17:57.171 --> 17:58.192
And I want to describe it.

17:58.252 --> 18:03.436
Okay, I'd like you to walk in and say, I'd like to buy four of these books.

18:03.497 --> 18:04.197
I mean, they're signed.

18:04.878 --> 18:07.240
And just to see, are they more expensive?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.682
And I'll bet they will be.

18:09.702 --> 18:11.644
I bet, unfortunately, Ben knows who I am.

18:12.063 --> 18:13.712
They're bullshit, honestly.

18:13.733 --> 18:14.859
Let's change the subject.

18:14.879 --> 18:15.684
Okay, okay.

18:15.704 --> 18:17.172
But you are a collector of things.

18:17.192 --> 18:18.580
You have some thoughts about collecting.

18:18.779 --> 18:20.180
We've talked plenty about the primary book.

18:20.200 --> 18:29.730
I'm a book collector in a... It doesn't even have to be booked, but tell me, you must have some thoughts about... I have a good collection of... ...to gather things.

18:29.750 --> 18:32.292
I have, unfortunately, a streak of that.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.436
But I have a great collection of 45 RPM records.

18:35.496 --> 18:37.958
I love... You said 78s in here.

18:37.978 --> 18:38.859
Well, I have 78s.

18:38.959 --> 18:44.385
Did I tell you that Steven Blumberg has a 120,000... You did, and he's beaten me by a lot.

18:44.605 --> 18:47.908
But I have a good collection of... I have, you know...

18:48.209 --> 18:50.533
I have Sinatra 78s and Gene Autry.

18:50.553 --> 18:51.594
I have some interesting 78s.

18:52.095 --> 18:53.437
But I love music and books.

18:53.738 --> 18:56.242
But every book I buy, I read.

18:56.402 --> 19:03.253
Every book in this house I bought, took home under my arm, and read, or want to read.

19:03.273 --> 19:03.974
And every record.

19:03.994 --> 19:09.542
So it has nothing to do with show or bibliomania to the point where... You don't have to be mania.

19:09.683 --> 19:10.504
No, I'm a reader.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.305
And I'll tell you one thing.

19:11.345 --> 19:13.408
I think the primary... People say, how did you know all this?

19:13.809 --> 19:15.432
And, you know, it's an interesting question.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.393
Well, that we can use.

19:16.627 --> 19:19.310
How do you know all this?

19:19.590 --> 19:21.091
And Nick, the answer's simple.

19:21.372 --> 19:22.032
I'm a reader.

19:22.653 --> 19:23.994
And I'm a conversationalist.

19:24.255 --> 19:32.903
And I can, everything that you told me about, you know, these things I'll remember, that you're talking about these books and collectors, and I'm interested, I'm a reader.

19:33.884 --> 19:38.769
And I can, and that's why a lot of people don't know this stuff, is because they don't read books.

19:39.009 --> 19:43.073
Do you remember that wonderful line in the movie, The Three Days of the Condor?

19:43.205 --> 19:43.626
Yeah.

19:43.686 --> 19:46.009
Remember the movie?

19:46.109 --> 19:46.409
Yeah.

19:46.429 --> 19:51.816
Well, actually, that character is based on one of my collectors, Walter Forzheimer, who is the spy collector.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.598
This is Forzheimer.

19:53.718 --> 19:59.706
I went to his house in the Watergate, and he's got the greatest spy collection in the world that's going to Yale.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.831
But anyway, and he built the CIA's library.

20:03.851 --> 20:04.311
Yeah.

20:04.472 --> 20:06.614
And so, this guy Grady did that book.

20:06.634 --> 20:08.957
He based it.

20:09.218 --> 20:10.219
But let me just finish.

20:10.579 --> 20:11.220
Remember they said,

20:11.403 --> 20:14.168
The John Houseman character says, how can he know all this?

20:14.188 --> 20:14.770
How can he do this?

20:15.090 --> 20:16.212
What does he do in the agency?

20:16.253 --> 20:17.896
He reads books.

20:18.196 --> 20:19.619
Yeah.

20:20.140 --> 20:22.044
But tell me something.

20:22.284 --> 20:23.667
No wonder he can do all this.

20:24.549 --> 20:29.639
People say, why is so-and-so interesting a person?

20:29.719 --> 20:31.302
I mean, I've known Edward Gorey.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.423
is a tremendous reader.

20:35.003 --> 20:35.965
And why is he witty?

20:35.985 --> 20:36.745
Why is he funny?

20:36.765 --> 20:38.828
Why is he full of anecdotes and charm?

20:39.008 --> 20:39.869
Because he's a reader.

20:40.249 --> 20:42.812
I can name 25 people, and you can probably name more.

20:43.132 --> 20:47.176
They're just wonderful, even shy people, when you tap them.

20:47.917 --> 20:48.478
Because they read.

20:48.798 --> 20:52.923
But getting back to that movie, was the Robert Redford character the one who supposedly did the reading?

20:53.323 --> 20:54.264
He was the reader, yeah.

20:54.284 --> 20:54.925
Oh, he was the reader.

20:54.945 --> 20:56.386
He was the one who didn't get killed.

20:56.406 --> 20:57.688
He was out getting caught.

20:58.228 --> 20:59.329
And they took out everybody.

20:59.770 --> 21:00.951
The CIA killed their own people.

21:01.268 --> 21:02.950
He comes back and discovers it.

21:03.050 --> 21:04.973
Now, he's on the run.

21:05.834 --> 21:06.835
Yeah, I remember the story.

21:06.855 --> 21:07.937
I never liked him much.

21:07.957 --> 21:11.542
But he's defeating all of these sophisticated... I mean, it's just a great line.

21:11.602 --> 21:12.203
No, I know.

21:12.243 --> 21:14.586
They said, how can he do all this?

21:14.606 --> 21:15.607
What does he do for us?

21:15.948 --> 21:16.989
He says, he reads books.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.070
Yeah.

21:18.090 --> 21:19.432
He reads books.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.474
So then it was clear.

21:20.734 --> 21:22.196
Of course he knows all of this stuff.

21:22.216 --> 21:24.899
He understands all of this stuff because he reads books.

21:26.381 --> 21:30.567
There's a great quote from Winston Churchill, which I use in my book...

21:30.715 --> 21:38.209
from Thoughts and Adventures, and Churchill says, the question is asked, do you read all your books?

21:38.229 --> 21:40.914
Of course, he must have had 50,000 books.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.496
And he said, no, it's impossible.

21:42.577 --> 21:43.338
I don't read them all.

21:43.358 --> 21:46.944
And he said, it's not necessary for a gentleman to read all the books that he owns.

21:46.985 --> 21:52.234
What is necessary is to know what he has, where it is, and how it can help him when he needs it.

21:52.484 --> 21:54.449
I look at my library like that.

21:54.469 --> 21:56.113
I've got 20,000 books in my house.

21:56.354 --> 21:58.018
Of course I haven't read them all.

21:58.038 --> 21:59.622
How can I possibly read them all?

21:59.662 --> 22:00.784
Tell me something.

22:00.804 --> 22:02.388
Do you have insurance on them?

22:02.469 --> 22:04.153
I mean, do you... Well, they all aren't weary.

22:04.233 --> 22:07.320
Don't forget, I review and I get... No, but what about my question?

22:07.340 --> 22:08.383
I know...

22:08.363 --> 22:15.976
Neither do I, and if people are always telling me to do that, you know, but I guess if Tom comes to my house, you think he's going to give a shit about these ugly Uncle Tom's cabins?

22:15.996 --> 22:17.319
He's going to throw them in the pool.

22:17.339 --> 22:19.362
No, I know, but that doesn't put no money there.

22:20.264 --> 22:30.642
There is a certain kind of Bloomberg that would, I only worry sometimes, the thing is, I think what you have to do occasionally, what I think I should do is get a book seller to come in and give them an appraisal, and

22:31.600 --> 22:32.863
They know more than you do?

22:33.204 --> 22:33.846
I doubt it.

22:33.866 --> 22:36.833
No, but your own appraisal, I think, is invalid.

22:36.914 --> 22:37.515
I don't know.

22:37.836 --> 22:39.701
It's a subject that I think about once a year.

22:39.721 --> 22:41.927
It scares me, because I have some things.

22:41.947 --> 22:42.889
Uncle Bob's cabin.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.255
I've got Emily Dickinson's first.

22:45.505 --> 22:52.471
I published some of the poetry, which I got for $15 up in Fitchburg, from a little old lady in the street, and I got it for $10.

22:52.492 --> 22:53.733
I beat it down for $50.

22:54.914 --> 22:55.654
That's one reason.

22:55.895 --> 22:57.196
If you go to hell, it might be there.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.379
Tell me something.

23:00.399 --> 23:01.280
She was happy.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.621
It was a consummated deal.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.904
Tell me some of the interesting autographs that you have.

23:07.045 --> 23:09.147
My personal collection.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.248
No, not personal collection.

23:10.628 --> 23:12.390
Interesting autographs in your library.

23:13.163 --> 23:14.264
Well, I'm about to tell you.

23:14.284 --> 23:18.088
No, but I mean, I don't mean, like, you know, to Nick from... Yeah, but I've got a thousand books like this.

23:19.009 --> 23:20.430
I've been doing this for 16 years.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.032
No, but what, okay, okay, go ahead.

23:22.052 --> 23:25.295
I've got Tom Wolfe and the right stuff, and I've got... Yeah, but he's a half.

23:25.435 --> 23:29.820
I'm talking, okay, but I'm talking about your most valuable autographs.

23:29.840 --> 23:30.941
To you, to you.

23:31.241 --> 23:33.824
I don't mean, I don't... The most valuable inscribed book to me.

23:33.864 --> 23:34.905
No, wait a second.

23:34.925 --> 23:35.966
Listen to my question.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.187
No, listen to my question.

23:37.428 --> 23:38.589
Listen to my question.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.833
Not the most valuable book, in terms of money,

23:43.285 --> 23:46.628
or inscribed to you, what are your most valuable autographs to you?

23:49.171 --> 23:51.473
In other words, not inscribed to you, because that limits it.

23:53.415 --> 23:54.576
I think of them as a family.

23:56.058 --> 24:03.045
To cut anyone out is... You know, I know a guy at Andover... I don't loan any books, you know, no books leave my house.

24:03.065 --> 24:06.228
You don't want to answer my question.

24:06.248 --> 24:12.634
Okay, I know a guy... They're all very... I thought you might say, you know, I have Alfred Lord Tennyson, it means a lot to me.

24:13.863 --> 24:22.255
I have a guy, let me just while you're thinking, at Andover, that has almost every wall in his room an original Ansel Adams.

24:22.275 --> 24:23.016
Well, can you say that?

24:23.316 --> 24:25.319
Ansel Adams photograph.

24:25.459 --> 24:26.801
If he printed it himself.

24:26.841 --> 24:27.743
Yeah, valuable.

24:27.763 --> 24:28.423
And he signed it.

24:28.924 --> 24:29.986
One of the worst books.

24:30.006 --> 24:31.568
$50,000 maybe.

24:31.848 --> 24:32.770
Each one.

24:32.970 --> 24:36.655
For that moonrise in New Mexico.

24:36.675 --> 24:37.356
They're awesome.

24:38.872 --> 24:40.294
I can't answer that question.

24:41.615 --> 24:44.318
If you come to my house, I'd love you to come sometime.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.881
We'll go from room to room.

24:47.702 --> 24:48.924
I'll pull little things out.

24:49.044 --> 24:54.089
I guess the Scarlet Letter that I have is the dearest book.

24:54.170 --> 24:54.910
Is it signed?

24:55.131 --> 24:57.774
It's not, but it made me a book collector.

24:57.794 --> 24:59.896
You're rowing down another stream.

24:59.996 --> 25:04.221
I'm interested in a signed book.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.873
I guess the six Faulkners that I have.

25:07.893 --> 25:12.418
Yeah, that's a good... You know what I always wish I had signed was a Malcolm Lowry under the volcano.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.942
I have a first edition of it.

25:15.002 --> 25:16.824
Really, that's if you have it with a jacket.

25:17.004 --> 25:17.285
Yeah.

25:17.505 --> 25:18.626
That's worth good money.

25:18.646 --> 25:19.468
Worth a lot, yeah.

25:19.788 --> 25:22.191
I never think of the money, even though I'm aware of that.

25:22.291 --> 25:26.817
I've never sold any one, but, you know, I...
