WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:09.367
Actually, I don't think culture even says that.

00:09.688 --> 00:12.272
I don't know whether I've asked him or not.

00:12.633 --> 00:22.950
But you might ask him what he means by intellectual freedom, whether it means professional disagreement and how one deals with the professional environment.

00:23.335 --> 00:27.102
He has no concept of collegiality whatsoever.

00:27.703 --> 00:31.751
Which I think also led to this building.

00:32.012 --> 00:34.937
I kind of feel it's a meaningless building.

00:35.438 --> 00:38.965
It's almost like a meaningless building.

00:39.400 --> 00:47.951
It's trying to cover so many bases not well, and it's losing the basic concept of what a library should be.

00:51.536 --> 00:59.647
He really had something against the departmentalization of the subject departments being in a really organized... Having an integrity, yeah.

00:59.667 --> 01:02.771
He didn't really believe the integrity of the subject area at all.

01:02.791 --> 01:04.513
No, he wanted a library without walls.

01:04.848 --> 01:05.329
Yeah.

01:05.489 --> 01:06.671
And boy, did he get it.

01:07.252 --> 01:07.953
Did he say that?

01:08.634 --> 01:09.275
Yeah.

01:09.295 --> 01:10.617
He talked about the library without walls.

01:10.637 --> 01:11.519
Tearing down walls, right?

01:11.539 --> 01:12.961
Take a look at the electronic library.

01:12.981 --> 01:13.822
I think he talks about it.

01:13.842 --> 01:15.805
Did he talk about it in there?

01:16.647 --> 01:20.874
That's why the Pompidou Library was so instrumental in his trip.

01:20.974 --> 01:21.815
Oh, what's his name?

01:21.855 --> 01:22.857
Coulter said he hated it.

01:23.398 --> 01:27.765
Of course, it's one of the... The Pompidou Library is the... Some of it is very good.

01:27.785 --> 01:31.611
I mean, the color scheme is... He hated the Pompidou?

01:32.392 --> 01:32.492
Yeah.

01:32.928 --> 01:36.175
Yeah, it really is.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.921
I mean, you know, I was only there for one day.

01:38.981 --> 01:40.685
I can't even say whether I liked it or not.

01:40.785 --> 01:46.898
I know I didn't like the color, the awful green color that they used for the bookshelves.

01:48.361 --> 01:50.465
Where do you see the new French library?

01:50.546 --> 01:53.552
Oh, I heard about it.

01:54.528 --> 01:55.469
I was there last night.

01:55.489 --> 01:57.331
You were there.

01:57.351 --> 02:10.764
Regarding the takeover of the libraries in France by the National Front, the Le Pen Party, and the disastrous effects upon the libraries of France of this right-wing political party.

02:10.904 --> 02:11.405
Really?

02:11.425 --> 02:11.505
Yep.

02:11.525 --> 02:12.406
It's very bad.

02:14.328 --> 02:16.550
How are they taking all of the libraries?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.031
They're throwing librarians out.

02:18.111 --> 02:20.213
They're censoring materials.

02:20.414 --> 02:21.835
They're firing librarians.

02:22.338 --> 02:25.522
Librarians are resigning because of this.

02:25.602 --> 02:28.586
They're closing down libraries, evidently.

02:29.227 --> 02:33.913
See, and that's another, I think really that's in the basis of this Kolder-Dowen axis, too.

02:34.194 --> 02:37.518
I mean, basically, isn't that quite, you know, quite obvious?

02:37.738 --> 02:44.948
But they have disdainful librarians, Kolder and Dowen, because that's one group that can question them.

02:45.168 --> 02:48.312
And for the collections, and for the public.

02:48.292 --> 02:55.425
And the point is, I really have to say, and he talks about, like anybody can do, I mean, we don't need librarians, we just need service people.

02:55.446 --> 03:00.515
It could be anybody, you know, there's just, there's no, there's no quality to that.

03:00.535 --> 03:04.603
Do you have a definition of what a librarian is?

03:06.667 --> 03:08.731
There's a softball.

03:09.472 --> 03:10.013
Yeah.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.589
disappearing?

03:13.310 --> 03:24.563
Well, I think a librarian is someone who is interested in... Well, you don't have to really talk about what the interest is.

03:24.603 --> 03:32.492
Is the library as a... actually as a refuge for independent... No, but I wrote the library as a person.

03:32.512 --> 03:39.460
The librarian is one who recognizes the need for an institution that will contain

03:39.625 --> 03:55.457
kind of the highest quality of intellectual achievements, make it available and interpret the organization and the collection of the library.

03:55.707 --> 03:58.911
I think understanding of the collection.

03:58.931 --> 04:00.714
Right, exactly, exactly.

04:00.814 --> 04:02.136
And that's the point.

04:02.156 --> 04:05.220
It's not merely just being custodian of what you have.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.622
Exactly, exactly.

04:06.682 --> 04:16.315
And also constantly developing in such a hostile environment is created here so that if you really want to develop in your area, thanks for teams, that's discourage.

04:16.295 --> 04:18.098
You know, no, you're just a pig here.

04:18.178 --> 04:19.661
We need a whole here, we need a whole here.

04:19.921 --> 04:27.494
And all of us who have some love of like our areas and we develop and, you know, we're interested in creating the highest quality here for the public.

04:28.376 --> 04:29.578
And also in depth.

04:29.999 --> 04:32.763
And also, I mean, I have a feeling you don't go to the lowest level.

04:32.783 --> 04:35.348
It's like you don't get to know exactly what they ask for.

04:35.588 --> 04:39.074
I think you create a collection and I think people will rise to a collective.

04:39.094 --> 04:41.779
If you create that kind of collection, people do rise.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.083
to the type of collection you have.

04:44.103 --> 04:46.047
Because you have great expectations, too.

04:46.067 --> 04:50.034
I think it is to create an intelligent public.

04:50.695 --> 04:54.061
It is the creation of a highly intelligent public.

04:55.364 --> 04:57.928
That's absolutely right.

04:58.289 --> 05:05.041
That's interesting, isn't it?

05:05.141 --> 05:06.163
And also has a love...

05:06.498 --> 05:09.663
Oh, well, you know what?

05:09.683 --> 05:11.085
I have to.

05:11.405 --> 05:13.629
I have to be back.

05:13.829 --> 05:14.510
I have to go.

05:14.630 --> 05:17.174
I have to be back, and I have about five more minutes.

05:17.535 --> 05:17.835
Okay.

05:17.915 --> 05:21.040
I mean, we're trying to just go all over the place.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.568
Yeah, but basically... It's also, I mean, in fact, we have to do talk about our love of books.

05:26.628 --> 05:32.657
I mean, many, I think, for librarianship is not an access to databases.

05:32.677 --> 05:34.500
Databases are fine, but that's what they are.

05:35.081 --> 05:35.762
They're data.

05:36.097 --> 05:39.067
And books are more than data.

05:39.087 --> 05:48.520
And that's why I feel, in a sense, what's happening in librarianship, even in these schools, is so unfortunate, where the emphasis

05:48.770 --> 05:59.503
is on the technology, yeah, the emphasis on technology, which is, at this point, not only very fluid, we don't know where it's going, but it's, what is it?

05:59.684 --> 06:07.313
It's, yeah, it's name is right, it's called a database, so it's data, and the library is more than data.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.778
This fits in, again, this is still a work in progress, but, did you have to use?

06:10.798 --> 06:12.480
No, she just has, she's coming right back.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.322
Is that, uh,

06:14.470 --> 06:24.259
So the librarians, if they don't train the librarians, there's no value placed on them.

06:24.420 --> 06:28.023
They're downsizing and outsourcing.

06:28.103 --> 06:34.449
And creating this terribly hostile environment to any of our ideals.

06:34.469 --> 06:38.333
Taylor is now getting books for... For Hawaii, right.

06:38.513 --> 06:40.275
They're ordering.

06:40.255 --> 06:42.742
You know, making fun of idealism.

06:42.762 --> 06:46.392
I mean, what is it except this is what people love when they come to the library.

06:46.953 --> 06:55.075
How many times, even in our library bondages, people said, we want books, we want a nice place to go to.

06:55.392 --> 06:57.475
and we want people who know about books.

06:57.615 --> 06:59.697
We want the librarians to help us.

06:59.717 --> 07:09.329
And the librarians even, I don't know whether Andrea mentioned this, when they did a survey of city workers, librarians got the highest marks here from the public of who are the most.

07:09.389 --> 07:10.130
Is that published?

07:10.150 --> 07:11.932
Yeah, oh yeah, it's in the Chronicle, right.

07:13.254 --> 07:18.901
The city workers, you know, there was a survey done of all the city workers and librarians got the highest mark.

07:19.362 --> 07:21.825
People love the librarians more than any other.

07:21.845 --> 07:23.887
I'd love to get a copy of that.

07:23.907 --> 07:24.488
The city workers, yeah.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.722
Andrea probably has.

07:26.902 --> 07:28.903
But it's in the Chronicle.

07:29.124 --> 07:41.454
So it's basically only a couple of months ago that we sat around.

07:41.574 --> 07:54.205
I think that people like me are being crowded out, we're being hounded, we're being treated with disdain and contempt.

07:54.337 --> 08:06.612
by library commissions and by library directors, I wouldn't say main strategies here.

08:06.652 --> 08:12.900
The techies, the people who are valuing technology over books, and they're winning the fight.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.885
Exactly, and talking about discourse, like there's no discourse saying, you know,

08:17.978 --> 08:21.183
He's even talking about prudent use of technology, and he doesn't see that at all.

08:21.203 --> 08:23.005
This is C, that's that one.

08:23.025 --> 08:29.214
He says that in order for libraries to survive, I can see where he's coming from, you have to be at the cutting, whatever.

08:29.234 --> 08:31.277
I hate all these terms to the cutting edge.

08:31.297 --> 08:35.143
Whatever that means, state of the art, 21st century, world class.

08:35.403 --> 08:39.649
Classes, right, it's a class, certain classes of libraries.

08:39.669 --> 08:39.990
I know.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.894
And he brings them out of the cutting edge.

08:43.835 --> 08:47.260
Cutting edge, bottom line.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.643
What else did he say, so to speak, if you will.

08:49.743 --> 08:50.224
If you will.

08:51.025 --> 08:52.166
If you will.

08:53.628 --> 09:00.396
And basically, it is kind of the humanist outlook is gradually being squelched.

09:01.497 --> 09:07.184
And it's a technocratic takeover of a cultural institution, and it's very sad.

09:07.224 --> 09:09.467
And this is an example of it.

09:09.487 --> 09:12.370
But also I have to say, Nick, the bottom line is,

09:12.974 --> 09:15.638
that they know smart or different than others.

09:15.698 --> 09:16.700
It's not working.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.145
Basically, this private health exam, this place doesn't work.

09:20.285 --> 09:23.590
So tell me, again, once more, you're from New York.

09:23.770 --> 09:24.051
Right.

09:24.071 --> 09:25.473
Where'd you go to schools in New York?

09:25.493 --> 09:27.316
I went, I graduated CCNY.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.620
I was, I taught in New York City public schools for many years.

09:32.143 --> 09:36.990
And you've been here since... I've been here since 68.

09:37.426 --> 09:38.487
Sixty-seven, sorry.

09:38.507 --> 09:39.248
Sixty-seven.

09:40.008 --> 09:42.431
Went to library school at Berkeley, UC Berkeley.

09:42.491 --> 09:43.512
And which degree there?

09:43.552 --> 09:45.393
I got, yeah, an MLS at Berkeley.

09:46.134 --> 09:46.955
MLS Berkeley.

09:46.975 --> 09:47.636
What year was that?

09:48.556 --> 09:49.057
Sixty-eight.

09:50.939 --> 09:54.822
And now, actually, I'm attending SF State.

09:54.842 --> 09:56.424
They have this elder college program.

09:56.444 --> 10:00.768
So for four or five years, I've been doing graduate work in literature and the humanities.

10:02.149 --> 10:05.172
And all of this is treated with disdain, you know, like.

10:05.742 --> 10:15.957
And what I said in that first column, when we first had that earthquake, and I hold to it now, is that this is not a humanistic library.

10:15.997 --> 10:17.459
It's a technocratic library.

10:18.941 --> 10:26.552
It's not an homage to culture, to history, even to the history of San Francisco, basically.

10:26.768 --> 10:28.190
Do we have a labor collection?

10:28.390 --> 10:32.715
Do we have, I mean, we have certain immigrant groups, but do we have other immigrant groups?

10:32.795 --> 10:34.858
Do we have a poetry collection?

10:35.058 --> 10:37.240
It's such a lopsided mishmash.

10:37.641 --> 10:38.722
I have to use that word.

10:39.403 --> 10:41.826
I was thinking about it just a few minutes ago.

10:41.946 --> 10:51.477
It really is about money, because even with the art and music department, even though they refuse to go along with the dumping of the books, they, too,

10:51.727 --> 10:54.615
had money that was donated or benefited.

10:54.675 --> 10:55.457
Was driving them.

10:55.477 --> 10:56.540
Yeah, was driving them.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.205
I said, who are they going to dump the other place?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.007
Yeah.

10:59.027 --> 11:00.090
I said, well, nobody knows.

11:00.912 --> 11:01.795
Oh, that's not true.

11:01.815 --> 11:02.918
I said, nobody knows.

11:03.218 --> 11:04.580
I said, you know, I'm no use.

11:04.600 --> 11:04.820
I'm no use.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.522
Go back to the Aegean stables.

11:06.662 --> 11:07.443
Yeah, okay.

11:07.463 --> 11:08.284
Okay, go back to that.

11:08.464 --> 11:10.426
Well, let me ask them tomorrow.

11:10.446 --> 11:12.469
Did you water the... I want to use them.

11:12.569 --> 11:15.192
That's that conversation.

11:15.212 --> 11:18.135
Did you water the... Weaving or discarding.

11:18.155 --> 11:18.596
Discarding.

11:18.636 --> 11:18.996
Discarding.

11:19.157 --> 11:19.517
Discarding.

11:19.537 --> 11:22.080
And what does he mean by cleaning out the Aegean stables?

11:22.861 --> 11:24.102
And I can drink.

11:24.222 --> 11:25.564
I mean, there are witnesses.

11:26.287 --> 11:30.672
Can he deny saying that, or is he on the record that's having said that?

11:30.692 --> 11:30.873
What?

11:30.953 --> 11:31.994
No, he's on the record.

11:32.014 --> 11:32.835
He's on the record.

11:32.875 --> 11:37.461
Cleaning out the Orgy in the Sables.

11:37.561 --> 11:39.143
He'll be very proud of his answer.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.344
Yeah, he probably will be.

11:40.364 --> 11:41.305
He said, yes, I agree with that.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.567
There's just too much crap here.

11:42.627 --> 11:43.648
Now, what about witnesses?

11:44.028 --> 11:53.560
Oh, when we were in the transition of moving from the old name to the new name, and it was discovered that there wasn't enough room in the collection, we said, witnesses.

11:54.502 --> 12:03.572
The chief of Maine at that time was Kathy Page, and you can even ask her, and said, we have to do massive weaving immediately.

12:04.312 --> 12:07.816
And she even mentioned, I've forgotten how many shelves full.

12:07.836 --> 12:13.702
We have to get... By the linear... By the linear... Or shelves full, or... Yeah, of range fulls, right.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.324
We just don't have enough room.

12:15.744 --> 12:16.865
This was never made public.

12:17.426 --> 12:19.328
I mean, in the public, in a sense,

12:20.219 --> 12:22.462
if you can talk to culture, never were told.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.464
I mean, they didn't vote for this kind of building.

12:24.484 --> 12:26.327
They were never told there was not going to be enough room.

12:26.727 --> 12:27.548
And they knew about it.

12:27.628 --> 12:31.213
They knew there wasn't going to be enough room about a half way through.

12:31.313 --> 12:33.556
And they realized they weren't going to have it.

12:33.676 --> 12:35.158
Well, we knew it from 1991.

12:35.218 --> 12:36.079
There's a petition.

12:36.099 --> 12:41.546
But even they knew it from this building itself, that there wasn't even going to be enough room, the room that they promised.

12:41.566 --> 12:42.447
And it was never...

12:42.595 --> 12:44.318
It was never honestly admitted.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.743
We don't even have the room that we had promised.

12:46.763 --> 12:56.723
And the fact that 60%, close to 60% of our periodical collection is over there in Brooks Hall is a testimony.

12:56.804 --> 12:59.627
And not only that, it's just as though it doesn't matter.

12:59.968 --> 13:01.530
It doesn't matter to any of these people.

13:01.570 --> 13:05.094
That the bulk of our periodical collection is over there.

13:05.515 --> 13:07.237
Because the whole thing is to be current.

13:07.357 --> 13:09.500
And as you said, like it's, you know, stay in the art form.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.262
Well, no, people aren't interested in that stuff.

13:11.282 --> 13:13.104
See, it's a sustain for history, too.

13:13.464 --> 13:14.586
People are interested in that stuff.

13:14.606 --> 13:15.767
They just want the latest stuff.

13:15.787 --> 13:17.209
And you just have to give them the latest.

13:17.442 --> 13:25.434
And as it was pointed out in that article in Harbors, is that basically you go into Barnes and Noble, you almost have more of a library atmosphere than you have.

13:25.454 --> 13:27.116
You have a greater in-depth collection.

13:27.136 --> 13:29.860
You have people sitting quietly doing homework.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.726
But the point of the library is not to be on the cutting edge.

13:33.786 --> 13:38.072
The point of the library is to have what people will not be able to find elsewhere.

13:38.132 --> 13:45.002
The joy, you know, the concept of going into it, we're not a bookstore.

13:45.438 --> 13:54.695
And this is a big philosophical difference, because as you said, there is for videos, there's blockbuster videos, there's Barnes & Noble.

13:54.715 --> 14:09.522
Basically, the unique part of the library is that joy of discovery, that you go in and you find something that no one else, it will be nowhere else, this is open to the public, and there's no other way of finding this type of material.

14:09.822 --> 14:13.608
Just to be able to discover unknown material that you're not even looking for.

14:13.628 --> 14:15.791
Oh, do you know what someone found?

14:16.071 --> 14:30.112
The only listing in the online catalog for Upper and Lower Canada directed her to a book printed in the late 18th century that was transferred from Brooks Hall up into our department.

14:30.373 --> 14:32.135
She said it was the most wonderful book.

14:32.155 --> 14:35.340
She's doing some research on the history of Canada.

14:35.607 --> 14:39.693
and needed that book, was the only one that she could find the entire library, and she'd found it.

14:40.574 --> 14:45.982
Well, this has been our constant experience, is, oh, we were looking for something else, and look what I found.

14:46.483 --> 14:48.005
And where else can you find it?

14:48.065 --> 15:04.028
I mean, that's the unique quality of this institution that is really being denied by this emphasis on popularity, on cutting edge, on the bookstore psychology.

15:04.008 --> 15:30.268
you're angry i'm really i'm pissed well what happened is that and i have to i have to end with even the words of my little grandson because he came to see my grandma in the library and as he came in through lock-in and he just saw these sweeping vistas and he said where are the books and that's a good question exactly everybody said but here's out of the mouth of bay right you know just where are the books

15:30.535 --> 15:33.902
A great old library has been really jerked around.

15:34.804 --> 15:36.287
Circle jerked around.

15:36.307 --> 15:37.369
Circle jerked around.

15:38.011 --> 15:39.835
No, it was a great old library.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.458
Circle jerked around.

15:41.478 --> 15:42.901
Oh, that was what they called.

15:43.102 --> 15:44.324
They called.

15:44.404 --> 15:51.379
Well, because he's talking about the fact that these so-called non-profit boards,

15:51.612 --> 15:57.521
all have the same members of the same San Francisco elite group, like the people on this board.

15:57.942 --> 15:59.945
Sherry Alexander is also on the board of KQED.

15:59.965 --> 16:00.806
Sherry Thomas.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.070
Sherry Thomas is also on the board of KQED.

16:03.090 --> 16:03.210
KQED.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.593
They're also on the board of the Presidio.

16:06.515 --> 16:07.456
It's a good article.

16:07.877 --> 16:10.421
All these people, the same people on all the boards.

16:10.641 --> 16:15.629
Dale Coulson, he's like a Pacific Stock Exchange, he's on this board, he's on that board, he's on that board.

16:15.889 --> 16:18.413
So all these kind of cultural institutions

16:19.102 --> 16:32.345
Daniel Flanagan.

16:32.365 --> 16:37.694
You found rare things in there?

16:38.215 --> 16:42.122
Just for the sake of the tape, can you just say who we are?

16:42.862 --> 16:44.244
I'm Alan D'Souza.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.448
Alan, and how do you spell that?

16:46.628 --> 16:50.634
A-L-A-N-D-apostrophe-S-O-U-Z-A.

16:51.456 --> 16:53.279
Okay, and your page, is that right?

16:53.299 --> 16:54.601
I'm on my library page, yes.

16:54.621 --> 16:55.843
S-O-U-Z-A, right?

16:56.564 --> 16:56.644
Yes.

16:56.664 --> 16:57.425
And you are?

16:57.625 --> 17:02.213
And my name is Claire LaVote, and I'm... C-L-A-I-R-E?

17:02.233 --> 17:02.834
C-L-A-I-R-E.

17:02.854 --> 17:02.954
Okay.

17:02.974 --> 17:03.755
And how do you spell LaVote?

17:03.775 --> 17:06.760
L-A capital V-A-U-T-E.

17:06.740 --> 17:13.040
And I work here as a 3616, a library technical assistant.

17:13.201 --> 17:15.207
I do a lot of processing.

17:15.227 --> 17:19.180
I'm interested in the people here and all of this work.

17:20.324 --> 17:24.209
the accessioning of books away, as they used the word dumping.

17:24.610 --> 17:25.731
That's what was going on.

17:25.892 --> 17:36.486
They were quite literally dumping books in the back of BPW, the Department of Public Works, pickup trucks, and just hauling them away to the graveyard.

17:36.526 --> 17:39.510
Claire actually managed to get some photographs of that.

17:39.931 --> 17:40.632
Is that right?

17:40.652 --> 17:40.872
Yeah.

17:41.092 --> 17:43.075
What were your thoughts when you saw that?

17:43.055 --> 17:49.340
Oh, well, basically, I felt like a fool, but I cried, and Alan was there when I was crying on it.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.959
I mean, it was just, it got to the point where it was happening so frequently in such numbers.

17:54.293 --> 17:59.920
And I actually, I did approach several of the administration and I asked them, please stop what was happening.

17:59.940 --> 18:04.165
And they told me that, you know, it was all this finger pointing as to who was actually responsible.

18:04.826 --> 18:07.309
And nobody wanted to take responsibility, I guess.

18:07.549 --> 18:12.635
And I mean, I can say, I don't know if I should say, so we'll talk about this.

18:12.655 --> 18:14.698
But I did go to the chief of Maine.

18:14.778 --> 18:17.822
I was also just come down the steps.

18:17.842 --> 18:20.265
She was the chief of Maine at the time, Kathy Page.

18:20.285 --> 18:21.546
And I said, I know.

18:21.566 --> 18:22.167
Yeah.

18:22.627 --> 18:23.068
Yeah.

18:23.048 --> 18:25.070
I thought she wasn't here.

18:25.130 --> 18:29.255
No, well, um, she's... In this room right now?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.016
Um, yeah.

18:30.817 --> 18:38.426
But, um... She walked downstairs?

18:38.847 --> 18:40.208
Okay, she made the stairs.

18:40.348 --> 18:44.754
Oh, just that, um, I mean, I approached people on that level.

18:45.154 --> 18:51.942
I stopped during the bathroom and I said, I know that there are other things pending, but, um...

18:51.922 --> 18:57.289
you know, this is going on and I don't think it's right and can you do something about it?

18:57.649 --> 19:02.255
And she told me basically that she was sure that my supervisor had other things for me to worry about.

19:03.556 --> 19:21.658
And at that time it was Dennis Menes and in fact I did go to him and I asked him for prevention to be involved in some sort of a program which was supposed to have been in existence and I spoke with the man who was responsible for the program as well and he just felt like his hands had been tied because he had no

19:21.638 --> 19:39.259
he had no set up to do any outreach into the community he had no staff it was him as an individual trying to deal with this mountain of books and to give them away and he had tried several times and each effort had been a failure in his opinion and so he was basically kind of

19:39.610 --> 19:43.474
I guess, resigning himself to what was going on at the time.

19:43.534 --> 19:45.236
It seemed like the only solution to him.

19:45.777 --> 19:47.939
But clearly there was another solution.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.962
We've had an incredible response once they got it up and running.

19:50.982 --> 19:56.709
I mean, people have flown here from other places in the country to try to take advantage of the books that we're giving away.

19:56.729 --> 20:01.894
Now, what was it about your job that brought you into proximity to this?

20:02.715 --> 20:04.437
Did you give me your title, by the way, or your...

20:05.328 --> 20:08.132
Yeah, I'm a library technical assistant.

20:08.192 --> 20:11.677
I use the wand, and I like zap barcodes.

20:11.697 --> 20:18.927
I process them, and I route them in, route them out, change their status, their location, play for damage.

20:18.947 --> 20:21.991
So you were doing this over at the Old Main?

20:22.111 --> 20:26.117
Well, actually, at the time there, I was working doing bindery work.

20:26.257 --> 20:29.682
I was assembling magazines so they could be sent out to get bound.

20:29.662 --> 20:39.577
And that was what brought me into proximity of the whole thing, was that I was there on the fourth stack probably six hours of every day, and I would walk back and forth there in the well, which you can see.

20:39.597 --> 20:41.039
So what did you think?

20:41.059 --> 20:41.540
What did you mean?

20:41.560 --> 20:42.562
Did you see truckloads?

20:42.682 --> 20:43.523
It was horrifying.

20:43.683 --> 20:45.466
It was like burying people alive.

20:46.568 --> 20:46.708
Really?

20:47.110 --> 20:49.673
Who was bringing books there?

20:49.693 --> 20:52.797
Actually, I would buy the books.

20:53.418 --> 21:04.251
There would be stacks of books on the shelves and my job was to make sure they were drawn and then tie them up in little bundles.

21:04.311 --> 21:14.383
They had to be nice little tidy bundles so that the DPW guys wouldn't hurt their backs and the books wouldn't fall out when they were tossing them in the back.

21:14.363 --> 21:27.643
and take the bundles neatly and stack them inside this room downstairs that was not under lock and key until after it hit the press.

21:27.963 --> 21:32.230
After it hit the press is when the opera book program went in full swing.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.952
How long was this going?

21:34.273 --> 21:36.075
Oh, months.

21:36.175 --> 21:38.599
Nine months of incredibly large dumping.

21:38.579 --> 21:42.185
Do you have any rough idea of how many books you think would offer?

21:42.305 --> 21:47.414
Well, I think that, I mean, the library, I know that the library admits to having thrown out 100,000.

21:47.915 --> 21:56.470
I would say just from personal estimation, eyeball that, and also just knowing the way that the administration tried to like spin the whole experience.

21:56.450 --> 22:01.999
I think it was more close to 200,000, maybe even more than that.

22:03.101 --> 22:06.607
So when you mentioned this to Catherine Page, you knew what the books were reading.

22:06.667 --> 22:07.068
Yes.

22:07.529 --> 22:13.799
Yes, and I mean, this is something that I've never, you know, I mean, I've never seen this print before, but yeah, she now, and she's right there.

22:13.839 --> 22:14.681
She's walking away.

22:15.262 --> 22:16.043
She's behind a pillar.

22:16.063 --> 22:16.664
She's got white hair.

22:16.684 --> 22:19.850
She's quite an attractive woman, and she's very nice, very personable.

22:19.870 --> 22:21.913
She'll climb the stairs over to you right now?

22:22.274 --> 22:22.474
Yeah.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.390
I wonder where she's going.

22:24.490 --> 22:25.812
Is she still in the building today?

22:26.133 --> 22:26.573
I don't know.

22:26.593 --> 22:28.716
If you want to go catch her, I wouldn't be insulted at all.

22:28.757 --> 22:30.980
I know she'd probably be a key element in your interviewing.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.342
So if you'd like to, I don't mind.

22:32.602 --> 22:33.944
No, no, no.

22:34.004 --> 22:38.230
I'll be on the building in a couple of days.

22:38.270 --> 22:40.033
This is important, by the way.

22:40.473 --> 22:42.176
This is important.

22:43.137 --> 22:44.479
So you are physically

22:44.729 --> 22:45.971
who were bringing books down.

22:46.051 --> 22:46.371
Right.

22:46.591 --> 22:48.654
So who told you to do that?

22:48.834 --> 22:52.659
It was my job signed by Dennis, first advised me.

22:52.679 --> 22:53.620
Dennis, once again.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.064
Dennis was... Dennis, how do you spell his name?

22:57.385 --> 22:58.406
M-A-N-N-E-S.

22:58.426 --> 23:00.869
Who was told by, who was told by, who was told by.

23:01.029 --> 23:05.475
I mean, basically, Dennis was told by... M-A-N-N-E-S.

23:05.735 --> 23:06.876
M-A-N-E-S-S.

23:07.337 --> 23:08.558
Do it what's called?

23:08.578 --> 23:09.960
M-A-N...

23:10.345 --> 23:11.368
Two N's or one N?

23:11.929 --> 23:12.671
No, ESS.

23:12.691 --> 23:12.992
ESK.

23:13.233 --> 23:13.674
And he was?

23:13.734 --> 23:14.135
Two S's.

23:14.456 --> 23:16.281
And what's his position?

23:16.321 --> 23:19.730
Well, at the time, he was just art supervisor in the department.

23:19.750 --> 23:20.793
He was a librarian, too, though.

23:21.194 --> 23:25.265
But there was a larger, there wasn't even overhead on the librarian.

23:25.285 --> 23:26.869
That's his name also, I guess.

23:27.102 --> 23:50.933
Another thing that happened was as staff started to get upset at the amount of dumping that was occurring, we had another supervisor on our floor who was immediate to the pages, and she came back from the meeting telling us that the tenor of the meeting was such that people were encouraged to not

23:51.132 --> 23:52.574
acknowledge what was going on.

23:52.594 --> 23:59.545
I don't know how to put it politely, but basically they were told to just sort of sweep it under the carpet if they were approached or asked about the process.

23:59.585 --> 24:00.327
That comment on it.

24:00.367 --> 24:00.607
Right.

24:01.428 --> 24:05.635
And that, in fact, more was on the way.

24:05.655 --> 24:06.977
More was to be coming.

24:07.077 --> 24:11.344
And there was nothing to be done other than to just sort of bite the bullet and deal with it.

24:11.565 --> 24:13.748
So what's your background for you there?

24:13.846 --> 24:19.496
Well, what do you... Are you planning to be a librarian?

24:19.536 --> 24:21.099
Well, yeah, actually, I am enrolled.

24:21.199 --> 24:28.572
I just started this semester at Santa Fe State, and it's a library of information science now.

24:29.033 --> 24:31.838
Right, and I'm avoiding him assiduously.

24:31.818 --> 24:36.207
In fact, I mean, he's already set himself up for, you know, an incredible reputation down there.

24:36.227 --> 24:37.590
He didn't show up for his first class.

24:38.432 --> 24:39.153
You know, whatever.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.677
He's very confident.

24:40.737 --> 24:41.639
How are you?

24:41.659 --> 24:42.260
Oh, yeah.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.284
I told him the ship needs to appear.

24:44.364 --> 24:48.954
I mean, this book will be published in 1999 by Kevin Goldberg Company.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.417
Exactly.

24:50.718 --> 24:53.221
We're more popular than the Giants.

24:53.321 --> 24:54.122
That's all he ever says.

24:54.162 --> 24:55.724
That was a quote by Steve Coulter.

24:55.764 --> 24:57.286
That's all he ever says when he was on TV.

24:57.326 --> 25:01.011
When the library came under severe criticism.

25:01.372 --> 25:02.273
On TV.

25:02.473 --> 25:04.716
That's all he could say in defense of the library.

25:04.736 --> 25:10.403
He's like, you know, we've got these increased numbers in circulation and people coming in.

25:10.483 --> 25:11.865
I'm like, of course, it's a new building.

25:11.905 --> 25:17.752
Several people made the comment that most of the people coming through the doors are here to use the bathrooms.

25:18.073 --> 25:18.193
Right.

25:18.173 --> 25:19.615
And Alan, how about yourself?

25:20.616 --> 25:25.582
I'm not intending at this time to become a librarian.

25:25.602 --> 25:31.830
I've just been thrown into the works of civil service and just embraced it.

25:31.850 --> 25:35.494
So are you both permanent employees or part-time?

25:35.514 --> 25:36.135
Yeah, permanent.

25:36.155 --> 25:39.619
So there's no anxiety about anything happening?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.021
There is.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.123
There's always that.

25:42.143 --> 25:45.166
This book won't be published for two years anyway.

25:45.186 --> 25:45.767
Right.

25:45.747 --> 25:51.713
Now, you know, it's my intention to do something decent, but that's something disruptive.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.095
And how long have you been employed here?

25:54.235 --> 25:56.498
I've been here two, three years, I guess.

25:56.518 --> 25:57.419
Three years.

25:57.459 --> 25:58.259
Claire, what you saw?

25:58.500 --> 26:00.141
I've been here seven years.

26:00.161 --> 26:01.402
Seven and a half years.

26:01.422 --> 26:04.726
So you were over there and here.

26:06.427 --> 26:15.096
Steve Coulter suggested, I say this for a response, that it may have been, this is what he said, an act of sabotage.

26:15.616 --> 26:24.597
on behalf of, not you personally, not you generically, the backup, the reshelving of books taken forever.

26:25.049 --> 26:28.013
Oh, that is insulting.

26:28.033 --> 26:33.019
As it means to protect your jobs and enhance the status of the statute.

26:33.039 --> 26:34.921
I'm sorry, you know, that is infuriating.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.244
I'm just curious to know what your response is.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.408
Well, I can't believe... I'm infuriating.

26:40.428 --> 26:43.191
Right, I can't believe that he would even suggest that.

26:43.992 --> 26:47.897
Well, he suggested that the white librarians are all racists, too.

26:47.917 --> 26:48.377
Right.

26:48.397 --> 26:52.162
And they're motivated by racism, which is a librarian.

26:52.182 --> 26:53.824
And I said, how could that possibly be?

26:54.327 --> 26:58.636
You just got my blood boiling.

26:58.696 --> 27:07.694
I mean, it's just ludicrous.

27:07.774 --> 27:14.327
I mean, it seems to me that the problem is because the staff had been

27:14.307 --> 27:28.848
And I can tell you again, I had a conversation with Ken Dallin after a staff meeting, and I asked him what the hell was he trying, I didn't say it like that, but I said, you know, can you explain to me, why haven't you hired any pages when it's so obvious that we need to hire them?

27:29.249 --> 27:35.438
And he pointed it out, you know, he just made it very obvious, not even obvious, he just said to me that in his plan,

27:35.418 --> 27:55.603
he wanted to basically reduce the paging staff so that it would free up the money so that they could turn around and hire you know three to four times as many people to do the job and he envisioned he envisioned that it would be high school students or college students who just wanted some sort of an introductory experience to the world of libraries not that it would be people on a professional track which is what his complaint was about the staffing

27:55.583 --> 28:21.220
in the building right now that when people get hired as pages they don't tend to stay here for a few years they're here for a long time it's just and it's a result of the job market i believe you know it's a very tough town and it pays well and people aren't going to flop away from the job he had come up with this proposal that he uh i mean he knew what he was doing yeah he gave to the collaborative commission where he was actually planning to lay off um

28:21.200 --> 28:48.253
pages and it was just like i don't know how we can do that we're already short-staffed where what are you going to do in the interim it was like the shelving back logic was sabotaged i mean that's that's that's that's i don't know he used that word he said he said by the way i'm not a legend but but i he said that oh yeah he said that i suspect it as well so well i don't know i mean i could tell you he didn't say i am a legend he said i'm not a legend but i suspect it

28:48.520 --> 28:53.856
And that just shows you, I think... They're clearly wanting me to use it, you know, and... Yeah.

28:54.832 --> 28:58.517
And I'm not trying to incite you to make any rash statements.

28:58.978 --> 29:00.420
I'm on this tape, too.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.762
I don't know.

29:01.842 --> 29:02.763
I'm telling the truth.

29:03.103 --> 29:08.751
I mean, I think that that in itself, I think that defines his relationship with the staff and with the public at this library.

29:08.771 --> 29:10.634
He's an antagonistic SOB.

29:10.954 --> 29:12.697
That's the program in a nutshell.

29:13.317 --> 29:16.221
Yeah, I don't know if you've attended any of the Library Commission meetings.

29:16.241 --> 29:16.962
I've always been here a week.

29:17.283 --> 29:18.304
They've actually calmed down.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.708
They were getting very fiery from him.

29:20.728 --> 29:24.653
People were, you know, calling him names.

29:24.633 --> 29:29.286
I mean, trust me, I'm a literary critic.

29:30.088 --> 29:34.761
Here's my background on that.

29:35.686 --> 29:49.108
I spent three hours with Tilly Olsen, and to call someone like her, you know, a troublemaker, a lefty, a court steward, you know, any number of other things, and this is really the element that's causing all the problems.

29:49.168 --> 29:51.952
That meant that there's anything at all wrong with this thing.

29:52.613 --> 29:56.780
He claims to have not known a thing about quick speed.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.601
And I said, who wanted it?

29:57.621 --> 29:58.723
And he said, we don't know.

29:59.210 --> 30:00.753
It's bullshit.

30:00.773 --> 30:03.318
I mean, there were memos sent around about aggressive weeding.

30:03.378 --> 30:03.939
I mean, it's true.

30:03.979 --> 30:05.502
Those memos circulated.

30:05.642 --> 30:07.565
They asked for aggressive weeding.

30:07.786 --> 30:09.669
Yeah, and that was what was going on.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.032
That was what came out of that day.

30:11.052 --> 30:14.639
Yeah, Kathy Bates, nobody's ever really addressed her on this, which I think is a real problem.

30:14.719 --> 30:15.901
Yeah, when you talk to her.

30:15.921 --> 30:22.433
At the old Maine, before she was actually a part of us, I guess she was still liaison with the new Maine.

30:22.632 --> 30:34.154
She met us all in the newspaper room and she addressed the rumor that was going around that the new Maine would not be able to house our current collection.

30:34.214 --> 30:38.903
She was very emphatic about this.

30:38.883 --> 30:45.294
If anybody tells you that the new Maine will not house the collection, send them to me, because that is absolutely not true.

30:45.394 --> 30:46.336
And look who we're at.

30:46.356 --> 30:47.958
I'm like, God, this is fucking bullshit.

30:48.319 --> 30:48.599
You know?

30:49.080 --> 30:52.205
We're at Brooks Hall, and it's like, we're still weeding.

30:52.927 --> 30:57.294
I see she's allowed me to go see that.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.015
Oh, right.

30:58.055 --> 31:03.304
And the other thing about Brooks Hall is they finally did this presentation that Ken Dallin showed

31:03.487 --> 31:12.756
and they morphed it on a computer terminal to show where the possible location for the car catalog would be in Brooks Hall.

31:12.776 --> 31:20.104
They went through and they swept the entire place out, and they did this beautiful magic morphing on our state-of-the-art 80s.

31:20.184 --> 31:26.871
A morphing is being able to take an image and artificially place it in an environment.

31:26.911 --> 31:29.213
They created the environment.

31:29.253 --> 31:33.257
They made Brooks Hall look like this clean, spare, white space.

31:33.862 --> 31:35.204
Very well lit, by the way.

31:35.224 --> 31:36.606
And what was this picture?

31:36.626 --> 31:37.267
It was on video.

31:37.287 --> 31:39.109
They could probably have it here in A.V.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.031
because they did the project here.

31:41.552 --> 31:46.719
And they made Brooks Hall look like this fantastic place for... Futuristic slab.

31:47.380 --> 31:51.605
No, is this Tate, the one that was done in 1987 or 88?

31:51.666 --> 31:51.946
No, no.

31:51.966 --> 31:52.847
This was a creation.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.049
It was required.

31:54.109 --> 31:59.977
It was asked for when the whole controversy over the card catalog came up.

31:59.997 --> 32:00.097
Yeah.

32:00.497 --> 32:01.118
And it's just...

32:01.587 --> 32:03.009
I don't think the commissioners have it.

32:03.189 --> 32:06.452
I don't know, did Andrea point that to the standing water down there?

32:07.133 --> 32:09.115
I didn't see anything.

32:09.135 --> 32:18.005
Well, I could show you where it is, but it's... We have a commission, not even, I mean, the last I know, not even all the commissioners even owned library cards.

32:18.025 --> 32:19.787
They didn't possess library cards.

32:20.028 --> 32:21.810
And what did he say?

32:21.970 --> 32:23.832
He said yes, but I know he doesn't.

32:24.301 --> 32:26.305
That's an interesting little line.

32:26.325 --> 32:28.810
We can check up on that for you.

32:29.331 --> 32:32.438
It's already checked out.

32:32.458 --> 32:33.700
It's infuriating.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.502
You look at my book.

32:34.562 --> 32:35.123
I do my work.

32:35.524 --> 32:39.392
I also asked him what he reads.

32:39.412 --> 32:40.895
What's the last book he read?

32:41.636 --> 32:43.480
I couldn't name the title.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.364
He reads science fiction.

32:45.732 --> 32:54.435
That our science fiction collection is sitting down in the basement.

32:54.455 --> 33:00.231
It's rotting, don't it?

33:00.700 --> 33:04.847
Do you think things are improving now with Gina?

33:05.868 --> 33:09.374
Well, not necessarily because of her, but things have been improving.

33:09.514 --> 33:17.247
I haven't really had much... I haven't been affected by any of her decisions so far, at least not that I've noticed.

33:17.848 --> 33:24.919
But I think in general, because of the hiring of these 40 new pages and the...

33:25.169 --> 33:29.755
the change in power or something, but Dallin left, and maybe so much.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.299
I mean, actually, I do like Kathy Page.

33:32.319 --> 33:35.884
I think that she may not be the best manager in the world, but I think she's a good person.

33:36.184 --> 33:37.145
Dallin had nothing.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.227
I didn't care for him as a person.

33:38.247 --> 33:39.268
I didn't care for him as a manager.

33:39.769 --> 33:41.532
Kathy Page is a very nice woman.

33:41.552 --> 33:44.616
Even Tilly Ellison said she feels very badly for Kathy.

33:44.696 --> 33:46.358
Yeah, I do, too.

33:46.398 --> 33:48.121
She's a very decent woman.

33:48.141 --> 33:48.601
Oh, yeah.

33:50.724 --> 33:51.345
But I would...

33:51.899 --> 33:56.546
But she was the person who was there while this building was being designed and built.

33:56.566 --> 33:56.787
Right.

33:56.807 --> 33:59.851
She was supposed to be kind of the... The liaison.

33:59.871 --> 34:05.300
So I asked Gina, and I said, you know, she was considered for this job with an endowment.

34:05.340 --> 34:05.760
Gina was.

34:06.181 --> 34:08.184
Yeah, she didn't get it.

34:08.204 --> 34:15.275
I said, now, had you gotten that job with this library, like it does today, it wouldn't even be a cost.

34:15.916 --> 34:17.519
You know, I would not have allowed anything.

34:17.539 --> 34:18.821
Yeah, I wish we had gotten her then.

34:18.841 --> 34:20.303
But that's a very honest...

34:20.992 --> 34:28.485
Well, I think it was Dallman's vision, not just... Well, not only that, I mean, there was a lot of... A lot of work.

34:28.666 --> 34:32.573
Well, I mean, this is just hearsay for the grapevine.

34:32.593 --> 34:35.398
Yeah, hearsay is great.

34:35.498 --> 34:41.008
Basically, she was a novice, and she was abandoned on her task.

34:41.028 --> 34:43.472
When she sought help, people turned her...

34:43.807 --> 34:57.748
Neither Dallin nor Coulter nor the city architects gave her the support and advice that was probably necessary to construct a library that was going to be able to survive 20 years of use.

34:58.066 --> 35:01.812
She was basically left out there on the boat by herself.

35:01.953 --> 35:10.307
I mean, I wish, I mean, I don't know, maybe she wants to do a building and consultancy around private business.

35:10.327 --> 35:14.194
She's going to go into a building and consultancy for library construction.

35:14.214 --> 35:16.638
I mean, I just thought, come on, get a clue.

35:16.798 --> 35:18.121
Oh, I know.

35:18.441 --> 35:19.162
Right.

35:19.243 --> 35:21.446
I was seeing the science fair.

35:21.466 --> 35:23.250
He was running for the ALA.

35:23.270 --> 35:23.550
Right.

35:23.530 --> 35:26.916
That was so great.

35:27.116 --> 35:29.000
I would have been very, very upset.

35:29.020 --> 35:36.574
Other librarians were threatening to remove their membership from ALA.

35:36.594 --> 35:39.118
Let me ask Claire a question.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.102
How old are you?

35:41.122 --> 35:41.603
I am 32.

35:41.623 --> 35:45.690
Because I am also very interested in the profession of librarian.

35:45.670 --> 35:46.251
Yeah.

35:46.272 --> 35:51.926
You know, I mean, you're lucky that there's a school you can study in, you know, I mean, Berkley's, I don't know.

35:51.946 --> 35:56.959
I know, I regret waiting so long, having waited so long to do this.

35:56.979 --> 35:59.545
But what motivates you to work in this area?

36:00.031 --> 36:06.261
To be perfectly frank, I mean, the thing that's motivating me is it's the shitty public service in this building.

36:06.481 --> 36:12.471
I mean, I'm disappointed frequently in the level of performance of my superiors.

36:13.212 --> 36:21.385
And I feel like what goes on is that the lower level people in this building end up doing a lot more work than they get credit for, and they actually are working as librarians.

36:21.405 --> 36:27.895
Even though there is an ingrained hierarchy and everybody would be horrified to hear that this is going on, it's a reality.

36:28.195 --> 36:35.247
And if it's going to be a reality, and then it's going to be recognized for it and get paid for it.

36:35.267 --> 36:37.690
But clearly it's a response to having worked here.

36:38.632 --> 36:38.993
Yeah.

36:39.013 --> 36:45.263
It might be some sort of, you know, mission to... I'm interested in young people who want to work with books.

36:45.283 --> 36:47.827
You know, with all this demise of the book stuff.

36:47.847 --> 36:48.448
Right.

36:48.918 --> 37:01.595
Well, there was a point when the pages thought that their jobs were in dire jeopardy, and there was a large gathering of us, probably about 20 people at least, probably more than 50.

37:02.055 --> 37:03.417
I don't recall the numbers.

37:03.817 --> 37:08.884
But we went in front of the commission, and basically people told their stories to the commission.

37:08.864 --> 37:10.226
This is who we are.

37:10.246 --> 37:10.927
This is what we do.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.128
This is what our qualification is.

37:12.169 --> 37:13.430
We're not just high school students.

37:13.450 --> 37:15.253
We're college students.

37:15.393 --> 37:17.215
Some people held master's degrees.

37:17.556 --> 37:18.477
Some people had families.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.779
Some people said their only job.

37:19.879 --> 37:22.743
It would be ludicrous to fire them.

37:23.264 --> 37:27.109
Well, it comes back about a week later that

37:27.089 --> 37:37.969
Actually, Dowlin told some of the union reps that somebody on the commission, and I'm assuming it's Steve Coulter, said, fire them all.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.832
You know, just get rid of them.

37:39.972 --> 37:45.923
I'm like, after the testimonials of the strengths, it was a very powerful movement on the pages part.

37:45.943 --> 37:51.493
Yeah, I think the biggest problem that our library faces, and this isn't about the history of the burning, it's just that we,

37:51.473 --> 37:55.938
have fallen into the grasp of the telecommunications industry.

37:56.138 --> 37:56.939
Of which, I'm sorry?

37:57.059 --> 38:00.103
The telecommunications industry, and it's in the body of Steve Coulter.

38:00.123 --> 38:07.251
And he is, I think, a... He is mean-spirited enough.

38:07.311 --> 38:16.502
He's just got enough of that... I don't want to say evil, but he's got enough of that short-sighted greed.

38:16.870 --> 38:46.270
personal glory vein in him to ruin it for you know hundreds of thousands of other people for you know years to come and I don't think that he I mean he's I'm sure his bottom line is make sure that you maintain a captive audience at the San Francisco Public Library we need them to keep buying you know those computers we need to maintain those lines and have them pay for them and I think that that's that's what his big trip is I don't believe very much that Steve Colter really gives a shit we have a literate society

38:46.807 --> 38:52.675
My sense is that it's a very anti-intellectual attitude.

38:52.695 --> 38:52.875
Yes.

38:52.895 --> 38:52.975
Yes.

38:52.995 --> 38:55.058
I spent yesterday with Nick Baker, maybe some day.

38:55.078 --> 38:55.559
Oh, is he back?

38:57.020 --> 38:57.321
Yeah.

38:57.561 --> 39:01.526
He's been helping me a great deal with this.

39:01.546 --> 39:05.892
And he has the list of last books in the system.

39:05.912 --> 39:06.693
Right, exactly.

39:06.713 --> 39:08.175
19,000 books.

39:08.195 --> 39:10.418
And we were going through the list.

39:10.718 --> 39:14.241
And I see all these Chinese books.

39:14.261 --> 39:19.145
I said, Jesus Christ, this is one of the most significant Chinese-American women's in America.

39:19.165 --> 39:22.408
Why would they get rid of these books, you know?

39:22.428 --> 39:25.711
And I said, this is just a list of last books.

39:25.811 --> 39:29.754
I said, do they have a list of books that they get rid of?

39:29.774 --> 39:30.895
He said, no.

39:30.915 --> 39:33.878
I said, you mean they didn't even record the names of the books?

39:33.898 --> 39:35.719
I mean, that's useful information.

39:35.759 --> 39:39.983
It would be very interesting to scholars at some point in the future to say,

39:40.435 --> 39:46.660
And that's why people, I think, fought to maintain the car catalog.

39:47.203 --> 39:50.496
Because, actually, a lot of dumping happened, and this is...

39:51.067 --> 39:53.590
A lot of dumping happened in Brooks Hall.

39:53.610 --> 39:56.174
There was stuff that had been stored there before we even moved over here.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.275
They never even went through it.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.917
They just took the boxes and threw them out.

39:58.937 --> 40:00.179
There's no way to know what was in there.

40:00.199 --> 40:01.501
It was never cataloged online.

40:01.741 --> 40:04.305
And I'm sure there were older, beautiful things.

40:04.325 --> 40:08.370
Once we moved over here, I mean... There were probably about 8,000 books like that.

40:08.530 --> 40:09.712
I know that that's a good figure.

40:09.732 --> 40:11.154
That's a good hard figure on that stuff.

40:11.294 --> 40:12.996
They were just dumped.

40:13.016 --> 40:20.466
You know, it's like, even though the Alexandria Library has been destroyed, and there is a catalog of some, you know...

40:20.986 --> 40:26.154
Even though certain books don't exist, at least in certain people, there is a record in these books.

40:26.295 --> 40:31.583
So you guys tell at least what books were considered worthy enough to enter the city's collection.

40:31.984 --> 40:36.852
And so I said this to Nick, and he said, it's a very anti-intellectual attitude.

40:36.832 --> 40:58.131
right right and i mean basically the whole mission statement of the library if you've gotten your hands on that and if you if you haven't i'm sure that gina would make it available to you is you know basically it's it's to make this into a popular um shallow broad-based collection well i asked her point blank i said

40:58.702 --> 41:04.868
Do you see the library as being a research debt?

41:05.128 --> 41:05.749
She said, no.

41:06.129 --> 41:09.573
And they said, there's an argument over and over again.

41:09.693 --> 41:15.999
In fact, she said, there is not a research library west of the Mississippi.

41:16.019 --> 41:16.980
And I said, come on now.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.903
I said, the Huntington Library is not a research library.

41:20.003 --> 41:23.526
I said, there are pediocrats.

41:24.407 --> 41:25.588
And she said, not really.

41:25.628 --> 41:27.450
But she said, I'm talking public library.

41:27.470 --> 41:28.371
And I said, OK.

41:28.823 --> 41:29.985
You know, I think L.A.

41:30.005 --> 41:32.269
probably has some special collections.

41:32.470 --> 41:40.585
But anyway, her attitude is that it's not the mission of the public library to be a research library.

41:40.725 --> 41:43.871
Let's tell that to Shaw and Virginia Woolf.

41:44.452 --> 41:46.014
Well, I mean, whatever, you know.

41:46.295 --> 41:52.065
You know, like Marie Sundeck, who are totally the product of their reading, you know, at libraries.

41:52.186 --> 41:52.907
Right, I'm sorry.

41:53.343 --> 41:56.047
I mean, I think that the attitude is fine.

41:56.087 --> 41:57.650
If we're going to shift gears, that's fine.

41:57.690 --> 42:01.937
I know that the municipal funds are shrinking or whatever, or not even whatever.

42:01.957 --> 42:11.352
I know that municipal funds are shrinking, and it's going to be a long time before these sorts of public services gain the value in the public side that they held at one point.

42:11.703 --> 42:21.939
But the problem here is that what goes on is we're deciding we're a popular library, so we're going to gut ourselves instead of just trying to hold on to what we have.

42:22.019 --> 42:27.707
It's like it suddenly makes it okay to throw out a very esoteric bibliography of James Joyce's Ulysses.

42:28.128 --> 42:31.433
It's ridiculous.

42:31.852 --> 42:33.113
I mean, this is what goes on.

42:33.153 --> 42:42.022
I mean, stuff falls off the shelves, and because it's, you know, it's the only copy we have, it's a reference book, and because it's so esoteric, nobody's really going to ask for it.

42:42.042 --> 42:44.084
It's not a Daniel Steele novel.

42:44.224 --> 42:46.006
It's not considered worth preparing.

42:46.026 --> 42:48.348
It's just, you know, and that goes on.

42:48.508 --> 42:49.910
I mean, I've had that experience here.

42:50.771 --> 42:54.014
It's in, I don't know, I wish I, I mean, this is bringing up a lot.

42:54.034 --> 43:01.521
I was starting to feel a little bit better about being here, but it just, I am, I'm actually, I'm very angry at what's happened here.

43:01.940 --> 43:10.675
I mean, yesterday we had to do our little introductions at school, and I think I was the only person that sounded the least bit political about why I'm there.

43:10.695 --> 43:12.959
I'm there because I don't want to see this happen anywhere else.

43:13.080 --> 43:18.589
I want to make sure that books are around for people that enjoy for centuries to come.

43:18.609 --> 43:25.922
I don't think that online is the only way that we can go or the way of the future.

43:26.543 --> 43:29.107
You said this at San Jose's?

43:29.187 --> 43:29.627
Yeah.

43:29.647 --> 43:30.769
You told this to the class?

43:30.909 --> 43:31.851
Yeah.

43:31.871 --> 43:33.072
What was the response to that?

43:33.172 --> 43:38.200
Well, the teachers responded very favorably, and so, I mean, I don't know.

43:38.620 --> 43:44.809
They were all kind of, you know, laughing just of what's happened here, or such an excellent example of what you don't want to have happen.

43:44.829 --> 43:47.613
I mean, the class was cracking up, because I said I'd left.

43:48.034 --> 43:52.500
I used to work for Congresswoman Pelosi, and I said I'd left that job, and I came to the library looking for refuge.

43:52.480 --> 43:58.530
and suddenly here I am again, you know, I'm in the middle of this political stuff, and they all started laughing.

43:58.550 --> 44:00.654
Is this an undergraduate degree you're working on?

44:00.674 --> 44:02.377
No, this is a master's degree down there.

44:02.397 --> 44:04.721
So where did you do your undergraduate work?

44:04.741 --> 44:05.642
UC Santa Cruz.

44:05.863 --> 44:06.484
Okay, in what?

44:07.025 --> 44:07.866
Politics.

44:07.886 --> 44:10.150
Are you going to school?

44:10.410 --> 44:11.653
Yeah, you are.

44:11.933 --> 44:13.115
Oh, am I going to school?

44:13.135 --> 44:14.157
I'm going to law school.

44:14.217 --> 44:17.242
Yeah, I'm going to school, probably just an art history major.

44:17.262 --> 44:17.462
Oh, great.

44:17.482 --> 44:17.863
Where?

44:18.097 --> 44:46.517
um actually right now at city college and planning and transfers in san francisco state and how old are you 27. terry olson is 85. i could have fallen down yeah i didn't know that's great i damn near collapsed she was wonderful there's one thing i want to say is like as far as the discretion as far as what books were read it or not um claire pointed out that

44:46.750 --> 45:07.003
maybe they would just not consider an esoteric book but sometimes it was not even that much thought given to it i was uh once we moved over to the old to the new main i went over made a couple more runs to the old main to get some of the remaining books out of sutra stacks which is the our compact storage below the building

45:06.983 --> 45:10.650
and we had all these boxes that were probably there from the earthquake.

45:10.710 --> 45:12.353
I'm not sure when they were placed down there.

45:12.714 --> 45:18.345
During the earthquake, we would stack a lot of books up and put them in boxes in order to house them in a different area.

45:18.846 --> 45:28.384
Anyway, I was bringing these boxes out, and my supervisor would look at the boxes and just like do a cursory glance at the top, a couple books, not even like

45:28.533 --> 45:43.673
pick them up just look at them and decide whether they were going to adopt a book or to to our collection and there was literally uh i'd say about 75 of those boxes went to adopt a book right off the bat and it was like

45:43.653 --> 45:45.716
No consideration after that.

45:46.116 --> 45:50.962
You don't know what's lying underneath there.

45:51.062 --> 45:56.029
I'm sure you've talked with Kathy Bremer, but I think she put it the best at a meeting, at a commission meeting.

45:56.209 --> 45:59.513
They had this whole bullshit was going on in the commission meetings.

45:59.533 --> 46:10.687
They wanted to have a public advisory board for collection maintenance here at this library, and she very aptly reminded them that what happened here was not the fault of librarians.

46:10.707 --> 46:13.170
It was an administrative decision to do this.

46:13.150 --> 46:18.165
and these people were merely told what to do.

46:18.922 --> 46:30.600
The biggest problem with this whole thing is that the review process was non-extent, and people actually in the branches who were going through the gossip books were told that the mean would hold on to these things.

46:30.620 --> 46:32.362
They didn't think that they were really being thrown out.

46:32.382 --> 46:33.784
I mean, I've heard that in retrospect.

46:33.804 --> 46:39.553
I've read that in articles that some of the branch librarians who've spoken with the press have said that that was what they were operating under, was that idea.

46:39.573 --> 46:45.402
And so I think a lot of stuff got thrown out from the branches that never would have been let go if they'd known where it was going to end up, you know?

46:45.888 --> 46:48.752
And that, to me, is the biggest problem.

46:48.852 --> 46:51.996
And even now, the review process still really sucks.

46:52.016 --> 46:53.598
There's no centralization there.

46:53.958 --> 46:58.644
There's no group that's coming together to look at stuff to decide which copy is the best.

46:59.145 --> 47:05.913
And so I think one of the criteria, and the one that prevailed, I'm sure, when we were doing the dumping before I moved here, was you have X number of copies.

47:05.953 --> 47:06.934
How many can I toss?

47:07.055 --> 47:08.296
And you just went and grabbed a few.

47:08.316 --> 47:10.579
You didn't look to see which one was in the best condition.

47:10.559 --> 47:16.584
And some of the stuff that was down there in the doctor book was, you know, it was just, it was excellent condition.

47:16.604 --> 47:18.646
I mean, beautiful old children's books.

47:18.726 --> 47:28.675
I mean, that's the one thing that's infuriating to me is, you know, I mean, things got thrown out like sets of like Mencken's, the American language, and now we're buying new sets of it.

47:28.955 --> 47:31.117
And we're acquiring new reference sets.

47:31.177 --> 47:31.938
I process them.

47:31.958 --> 47:32.278
Is that right?

47:32.378 --> 47:35.201
Yeah, and that's like one of the things that's really pissing me off.

47:35.221 --> 47:36.242
You're buying books that went there with them.

47:36.262 --> 47:40.245
Yeah, we're buying a new books that got tossed and that were in fine condition.

47:40.343 --> 47:41.204
And they were hardbacks.

47:41.304 --> 47:42.005
And they were hardbacks.

47:42.025 --> 47:43.447
And now we're buying paperbacks.

47:43.467 --> 47:45.189
And Macon comes to mind.

47:45.289 --> 47:48.112
Can you think of any of that?

47:48.332 --> 47:48.512
Yeah.

47:48.572 --> 47:50.314
That's just the one that I know.

47:50.395 --> 47:52.757
I'll give you my... I've got an 800 number on there.

47:52.777 --> 48:02.008
If you want to give me... The one thing that I... The most important thing to me is that I know personally in the week there that I was getting very upset about what was going on.

48:02.088 --> 48:04.731
And one day I went to, I think...

48:04.947 --> 48:06.509
four different administrators.

48:06.689 --> 48:08.111
I went to Olive James.

48:08.511 --> 48:09.833
I went to Roberto Estevez.

48:09.873 --> 48:12.676
I went up to Roberto Estevez and said, can I please tell them to stop?

48:12.696 --> 48:16.200
Because I went down and I told the man who was throwing the books into the truck to stop.

48:16.220 --> 48:17.421
And he said, nobody wants these.

48:17.441 --> 48:18.062
This is our job.

48:18.082 --> 48:19.083
We're supposed to take them away.

48:19.463 --> 48:20.344
And I said, well, hold on.

48:20.385 --> 48:23.448
And I ran up to the chief of Maine's office and I said, would you please tell them to stop?

48:23.909 --> 48:24.489
I'm serious.

48:24.569 --> 48:25.931
I said, would you please tell them to stop?

48:25.951 --> 48:29.655
And he said that, and he, you know, I don't know if you know Mr. Estevez, but he,

48:29.990 --> 48:54.681
um he has uh i don't know how to say it but not a very good reaction to people a lot of times and and he was he said he's an authoritarian and he was just basically made it clear that it wasn't my you know my area yeah concern well not even that but just that um you know that that no he couldn't tell them to stop and who the hell basically what the attitude was who the hell was i to even come up and talk to him about it

48:54.661 --> 48:57.847
And that it was under the purview of this other guy, Rich Walsh.

48:58.287 --> 49:05.139
And so I then, the next few days, looked for Rich Walsh to talk to him because it was DPW that was coming and taking the stuff.

49:05.159 --> 49:08.665
And in that time, it was when I encountered Kathy Page in the bathroom.

49:08.765 --> 49:09.647
She didn't know me.

49:09.767 --> 49:10.809
I just knew who she was.

49:10.869 --> 49:11.771
I introduced myself.

49:11.851 --> 49:14.676
I explained to her what I'd been observing and said, clearly, there's a problem.

49:14.756 --> 49:16.018
Can't we do something about this?

49:16.739 --> 49:20.145
And she said that my supervisor probably had other things for me to worry about.

49:20.125 --> 49:27.359
I said, well, if I get permission from my supervisor, may I be, you know, part of some sort of program to get this stuff, you know, distributed?

49:27.699 --> 49:29.342
And she said, certainly, or something like that.

49:29.362 --> 49:35.093
But it was all very, you know, I wouldn't say snide, but just kind of not great.

49:35.273 --> 49:36.897
Well, exactly.

49:37.538 --> 49:40.123
You know, the Holocaust already works.

49:40.143 --> 49:43.028
Once the world did know, once it did hit the press,

49:43.362 --> 49:45.305
Oh, you should have seen the backpedaling they were doing.

49:45.585 --> 49:47.248
They had all these calls coming in.

49:47.568 --> 49:50.292
It was sad to me that people had a lie on the phone.

49:50.312 --> 49:50.753
Oh, yeah.

49:50.773 --> 49:53.917
We could hear people just telling blatant lies like, no, no, it's not going on.

49:53.937 --> 49:55.079
But I think they may have believed it.

49:55.139 --> 49:59.906
I mean, I don't know how they could have not seen what was going on a mere 10 feet from them out a window.

50:00.267 --> 50:02.850
But they sat there on the phone and said, oh, no, that's not true.

50:02.870 --> 50:06.636
Everything you've been reading is unfortunately, you know, it's a misstatement or, you know, whatever.

50:07.758 --> 50:08.779
And it was...

50:08.759 --> 50:20.053
And these are people who are good people who actually would not normally, I think it was not... I mean, I think there was a pressure on them from on high to lie, because if the library admitted what had been going on, I mean, it would have been a terrible public reaction.

50:20.153 --> 50:22.797
Did you try to rescue any books?

50:23.037 --> 50:23.177
Yes.

50:23.457 --> 50:24.378
I mean, everybody.

50:24.439 --> 50:27.202
And I didn't want to say that on tape, actually.

50:27.262 --> 50:28.383
But yeah, like the H.L.

50:28.404 --> 50:33.930
Mencken's American Language, I have it at home because they threw it out, you know, and then there they are, they're buying it again.

50:33.950 --> 50:37.635
But books like psychological dictionaries, I mean...

50:37.615 --> 50:44.265
There were definitely things that could be thrown out, like old books in print.

50:45.486 --> 50:52.596
That's the thing that Coulter likes to say, that if we had our way, we would hang on to absolutely everything.

50:52.837 --> 50:55.320
That's not what the people around here are saying.

50:55.861 --> 51:02.070
They're saying that what happened was done so hastily and with so little vision.

51:02.405 --> 51:03.607
So you did save some books.

51:03.627 --> 51:04.028
Oh, yeah.

51:04.048 --> 51:04.810
Oh, totally, yeah.

51:04.830 --> 51:06.834
I've got a pretty decent collection.

51:06.854 --> 51:07.676
A lot of people did.

51:07.696 --> 51:09.459
A lot of people you probably won't even talk to.

51:09.539 --> 51:11.363
Could you describe it generally in terms of content?

51:11.984 --> 51:17.395
Well, a lot of them I took just because they were very pretty books.

51:17.535 --> 51:17.916
I don't know.

51:18.096 --> 51:20.481
There were a lot in foreign languages that I...

51:21.085 --> 51:25.233
I wouldn't be able to understand, but the binding of them.

51:25.253 --> 51:26.255
19th century?

51:26.315 --> 51:27.457
Yeah, beautiful.

51:27.958 --> 51:31.825
That purpose only is why I saved those books.

51:31.885 --> 51:37.135
There are other books, The Anatomy of the Horse, which I've seen quite often referred to.

51:37.596 --> 51:41.423
I think it's Vesalius' book, I'm not too sure.

51:41.774 --> 51:44.678
We've got one copy left right now, and it's in the hardback.

51:44.698 --> 51:47.042
I do have a paperback version of it.

51:47.062 --> 51:53.711
You know, one other thing is they throw out all these old, huge Webster's libraries, I mean, dictionaries we had.

51:53.791 --> 51:56.796
And not that that's a huge loss, I mean, whatever.

51:56.936 --> 52:01.302
But the thing is that we're at a point now where we don't have the money to buy new ones, and they could have repaired them.

52:01.703 --> 52:05.108
And I mean, I know several people who walked home with those dictionaries.

52:05.128 --> 52:07.010
I mean, you know, it's that kind of stuff.

52:07.030 --> 52:08.873
It's just, you know, very little sight.

52:08.893 --> 52:09.714
It must have been hysterical.

52:09.734 --> 52:10.195
The rest of us say that

52:10.951 --> 52:12.954
We can't get those books into that place.

52:13.014 --> 52:15.597
What the hell are we going to do with this stuff?

52:15.617 --> 52:19.483
The library was not built for 1996.

52:19.523 --> 52:24.049
Never mind 23 years down the road, which is the minimum projection.

52:24.069 --> 52:25.571
You're supposed to do at least 20 years.

52:25.671 --> 52:28.915
One would hope you did 22 more than that.

52:28.936 --> 52:32.020
It was, well, 20 years, we're not going to have books.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.702
This is going to be all on computers.

52:34.323 --> 52:35.785
Well, I don't be so sure.

52:35.805 --> 52:37.066
Oh, that's not my words.

52:37.167 --> 52:42.633
I mean, I think that's what people like Steve Colter would like us to believe so that they can make a lot more money, you know?

52:42.653 --> 52:48.080
I mean, if everybody thinks that that's the way it has to be, then, you know, everybody will give up and let it be like that.

52:48.220 --> 52:51.504
Let me just say, because I know you have to go back to you, but it's almost more.

52:51.524 --> 52:53.126
I don't want you to get in trouble.

52:53.968 --> 52:56.310
But, you don't object to somebody using your names.

52:56.871 --> 52:58.373
No, I don't.

52:58.623 --> 53:13.510
I understand that some people think that it's a tribute to the community, but I find it rather

53:13.878 --> 53:17.484
Well, the popular term in a while back was vulcanizing.

53:17.544 --> 53:21.991
I mean, I think what it has done is pitted groups against each other, trying to get money for different things.

53:22.011 --> 53:25.778
You're talking about these affinity groups and the foundation and all this stuff.

53:25.798 --> 53:27.661
Yeah, and as you're saying, I mean, they are a big joke.

53:27.681 --> 53:28.843
They're basically empty rooms.

53:29.063 --> 53:35.734
We don't have enough staff to go in there to make them function as these centers that they could conceivably have, you know,

53:35.714 --> 53:43.103
Well, I think even in that capacity, I don't know that they were necessary.

53:43.123 --> 53:49.891
I mean, I think it undermines the idea that we are one community and that everybody is included and that there's room for everything.

53:49.951 --> 53:54.035
And the beauty of a library is that you're going to encounter something that you might not have.

53:54.556 --> 53:58.060
And when they created these centers, what I felt like happened was

53:58.445 --> 54:18.150
Actually, all of the little nuances in this building, all the little special whatever, the International Center, the African American Center, the way that they've divided the collection up, I feel like it has actually eroded the public's capability to come upon something that they might not have been searching for.

54:18.170 --> 54:20.833
And that, to me, is one of the most important things about a library.

54:20.853 --> 54:23.136
It's also a lot of special interests to determine...

54:23.926 --> 54:25.148
intellectual inquiry.

54:25.728 --> 54:30.835
If you come up with enough money to get the Filipino-American thing, then that's a collection that will develop.

54:31.396 --> 54:31.536
Right.

54:31.836 --> 54:31.997
Right.

54:32.017 --> 54:37.063
It's not because this is something we ought to be doing, and this is a strength in this community, and, gee, there's a lot of stuff here.

54:37.083 --> 54:41.049
We can get a very, very strong research depth.

54:41.109 --> 54:47.096
But these are the things, these are the factors that should be influencing the development of a collection.

54:47.117 --> 54:50.541
Not if you can get some, shake some people now for some dough, and

54:50.875 --> 54:54.741
Hey, we'll call this collection the Presby or whatever.

54:54.761 --> 54:55.822
This is going to be the business.

54:57.685 --> 55:02.932
That's not how scholarship should be directed.

55:02.952 --> 55:05.196
A lot of that money probably didn't go towards the collection.

55:05.436 --> 55:07.259
The technology that's in this building is amazing.

55:07.299 --> 55:10.023
You've seen the internet, which are used extensively.

55:10.403 --> 55:13.207
But I don't know if you know about the walking signs.

55:13.227 --> 55:15.591
These little black boxes on the ceiling.

55:15.651 --> 55:19.937
People can get these signs if they're deaf, not deaf, if they're blind.

55:20.221 --> 55:23.465
And they can walk around and point these things, and they navigate by them.

55:23.885 --> 55:27.990
And they can locate the paging desk, the reference desk, any center.

55:28.050 --> 55:36.139
And we've got the ADA terminals, which make the library more accessible to people with disabilities, handicapped visual and physical.

55:37.921 --> 55:38.622
But they're not used.

55:39.283 --> 55:40.664
I don't think I've ever seen them used.

55:40.684 --> 55:41.846
The walking sign is definitely not.

55:41.866 --> 55:45.790
The ADA terminals, the only ADA terminal that's ever used is one on our floor, the ones on the fort.

55:46.006 --> 55:50.613
and the fifth are not being used.

55:50.673 --> 56:00.187
The reason that is is because Alan and I were nominally trained on these things and actually Alan retained the knowledge and I did not.

56:00.207 --> 56:04.212
And he's actually the only person in the building who can sit down with somebody and show them how to use this stuff.

56:04.273 --> 56:10.782
And Alan is working here as a page and this is something that a librarian or a program manager should be doing and organizing and, you know.

56:10.762 --> 56:30.745
and publicizing and that's not happening in our building and it's like when people come up everybody just kind of runs and looks for Alan because you know he's the only person I saw some emails that they're actually trying to get that on the ball and trying to actually get some training but it's what a year and a half down the road and finally they're going to try to get some training it's like

56:30.944 --> 56:34.069
well, why did we buy technology if we didn't know there was going to staff for it?

56:34.389 --> 56:36.152
You know, the usage of it.

56:36.172 --> 56:44.385
It's like, you know, I'm one of those people who, when I buy an instrument, I buy it with all the whistles and bells you could possibly use, and then I use the three buttons, you know?

56:45.106 --> 56:46.288
And this is what the library's done.

56:46.308 --> 56:48.812
It's like, you know, they followed my direction, maybe, you know?

56:49.212 --> 56:50.594
But at least I'm a private individual.

56:50.634 --> 56:53.779
I didn't spend the public's money to blow it.

56:53.799 --> 56:56.243
Here they spend the public's money and just wasted it.

56:56.223 --> 56:59.007
They took their eye off the ball, as we say.

56:59.027 --> 57:04.594
The ball should have been the books and the collections.

57:05.375 --> 57:09.941
Not when you had hand down.

57:10.361 --> 57:12.143
The book was not at all.

57:12.164 --> 57:17.230
It was supposed to have a center for the book here in the library, and that was one of the first centers to go.

57:17.390 --> 57:21.015
Is that right?

57:21.516 --> 57:21.876
Yeah.

57:22.835 --> 57:25.379
Yeah, it was going to be.

57:25.399 --> 57:29.945
There's this incredible lab that's sitting there idly, or maybe it's just the space.

57:29.985 --> 57:31.628
Nobody's ever been wowed into it.

57:32.469 --> 57:34.853
Yeah, it was supposed to be a preservation unit.

57:35.373 --> 57:37.356
So why?

57:37.436 --> 57:41.642
He could go off on it for you.

57:41.823 --> 57:45.768
He could give you an earful.

57:45.788 --> 57:49.213
It's been his personal sorrow.

57:50.495 --> 57:51.677
I know John Cole.

57:52.535 --> 57:55.457
I gave a talk at the Library of Congress last year at the Center of...
