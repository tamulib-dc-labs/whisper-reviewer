WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:03.664
Okay, I'm sorry you said that.

00:03.684 --> 00:05.146
Yeah, no problem.

00:05.406 --> 00:09.350
This we can't make sure at the moment.

00:09.370 --> 00:22.042
We can do this at the moment for these electronic publications on physical carriers, on handheld electronic publications.

00:23.463 --> 00:28.227
But we can't do this at the moment for online publications.

00:28.247 --> 00:29.869
We have two reasons for that.

00:31.857 --> 01:01.577
we have no definition what is really an online publication and when is this online publication ready so we try to do some projects together with publishers that we get a message or something like that from the publishers which say

01:01.760 --> 01:06.947
Well, this is an authorized, finished online publication.

01:09.411 --> 01:10.192
And do they do that?

01:11.033 --> 01:12.796
Well, Springer is doing that.

01:13.336 --> 01:15.600
We start our project with Springer.

01:16.261 --> 01:17.022
It's a publisher?

01:17.422 --> 01:18.183
It's a publisher.

01:18.544 --> 01:20.126
S-P-R-I-N-G-E-R.

01:20.146 --> 01:20.887
Yeah, right.

01:22.089 --> 01:25.033
And, well...

01:26.212 --> 01:44.668
They are working with these digital object identifiers so that we can really be sure that this is an online publication.

01:46.251 --> 01:48.996
I don't understand how you can be sure.

01:50.478 --> 02:00.111
So if they don't tell you that it's coming online, so you know it's an online publication, but an issue here is does it exist in any other form, right?

02:00.131 --> 02:11.626
So they're telling you this is the only... No, they can tell us, well, this is the printed form, for instance, and this is an online form.

02:11.646 --> 02:16.092
So we will collect both of them at the moment.

02:16.592 --> 02:18.595
Even if they're identical, you'll collect both.

02:18.946 --> 02:21.029
even if they are identical.

02:21.049 --> 02:29.421
Well, because we say it's not only the content, but it's also the form of the publication.

02:30.763 --> 02:32.325
That's important here to you.

02:32.345 --> 02:33.166
Yeah, of course.

02:33.246 --> 02:34.608
There are some places where it's not.

02:34.628 --> 02:36.311
Yeah, that's right.

02:36.331 --> 02:37.753
In the United States, may I say.

02:37.793 --> 02:38.634
You know that.

02:38.714 --> 02:41.058
I mean, Cornell was usually working.

02:41.078 --> 02:41.839
I've been up there.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.341
I know, yes.

02:43.361 --> 02:44.903
And that's very interesting to me.

02:45.676 --> 02:50.542
Well, that's our character of an archive library.

02:51.784 --> 02:55.128
And while we also have, of course... Explain that.

02:55.148 --> 02:56.810
We'll go on with that a little bit, if you don't mind.

02:58.873 --> 03:02.718
Well, we... But not all archive libraries.

03:02.738 --> 03:04.400
It's the character of your archive library.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.203
Because we have to collect all publications.

03:08.205 --> 03:15.514
Our legal deposit means that we have to collect all publications.

03:16.507 --> 03:41.459
And it's not important whether they are printed or on CD-ROM or online, but it's important that they are publications, they are the same things, the same, well, at least contents in it, but in different forms.

03:42.601 --> 03:45.805
And up to now we also collect

03:46.308 --> 03:50.633
different copies of the same publications.

03:50.653 --> 04:08.035
If you have the first copy in 1975 for instance and the second copy in 1982 then we collected these things up to this year.

04:08.075 --> 04:14.863
This year we stopped these so we will not collect any longer

04:17.003 --> 04:24.693
Same books, but different copy editions.

04:25.214 --> 04:35.167
Just to repeat though, you say that it is the character of this archive that you keep a copy of everything in every form.

04:35.268 --> 04:38.852
The form is of equal importance to the content.

04:39.133 --> 04:39.433
Right.

04:40.615 --> 04:41.156
This is right.

04:41.636 --> 04:46.723
If you have a copy printed and a copy online, so we try to collect books.

04:47.294 --> 04:57.603
And if I were to tell you of an institution in the United States, for instance, that has correspondence that originated from the founder of this institution.

04:57.623 --> 05:04.249
Now, to this hand, let's say, but this is before there was carbon paper or Xerox machines.

05:05.210 --> 05:14.297
And if they have decided that they are going to just scan this correspondence and then dispose of the originals, you'd probably be horrified.

05:15.899 --> 05:16.199
Right.

05:16.219 --> 05:17.200
Wouldn't you?

05:17.348 --> 05:18.189
I am.

05:18.289 --> 05:20.292
I personally, absolutely.

05:20.312 --> 05:21.193
We keep both.

05:21.393 --> 05:22.094
We keep all.

05:22.134 --> 05:27.401
Again, I tend to like it.

05:27.601 --> 05:37.214
I can only imagine that I can scan these things to give access to a wider circle as a tool.

05:37.774 --> 05:40.278
You see, we are doing a project.

05:40.858 --> 05:46.866
We have a department in our library which is called Exile.

05:47.285 --> 05:47.886
Exile.

05:48.526 --> 05:49.628
Exile.

05:49.808 --> 06:02.182
That means we collect all these things in connection with exiled peoples during Sinati period.

06:03.283 --> 06:15.216
Of course, we collect a lot of letters and handwritten things and all these things, but we also collect printed journals from that time.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.418
These journals are in a very bad condition.

06:19.859 --> 06:30.876
So we try to scan them and use the scanned images as a tool to give access, wider access to these materials.

06:31.096 --> 06:40.050
But of course we will do everything to keep the original materials.

06:40.571 --> 06:43.836
This means we are an archive library.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.007
we to keep also the original materials, not only the converted form.

06:49.027 --> 06:50.850
Is this exile archive kept here?

06:51.050 --> 06:51.310
Yeah.

06:51.651 --> 06:52.512
Is that the name of it?

06:53.153 --> 06:55.216
Deutsches Exilarchiv.

06:55.236 --> 06:59.562
That's interesting to me.

06:59.602 --> 07:04.189
Again, because this is, again, an expression of your mandate.

07:04.689 --> 07:08.575
You're not allowing political considerations to dictate

07:09.044 --> 07:10.946
the kinds of things that you're going to collect.

07:10.966 --> 07:14.509
You're going to collect everything because it does reflect on the history of your country.

07:14.769 --> 07:18.853
This to me is what a library is supposed to be doing.

07:19.093 --> 07:19.413
Yeah.

07:19.493 --> 07:20.854
That's fascinating.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.456
And the form is very important.

07:22.896 --> 07:23.336
Yeah.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.658
Because the form is an expression in itself.

07:25.678 --> 07:26.579
Yeah.

07:27.360 --> 07:38.950
So we keep, and you can see examples tomorrow in Leipzig, even the form if the book is given in a...

07:39.470 --> 07:48.365
In a hardcover and leather binding.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.169
So we keep both, we do.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.491
Yeah, of course.

07:53.214 --> 07:53.875
Of course.

07:53.895 --> 08:03.672
You'd be amazed at how many people... There are universities in my country where if a book isn't used for five years,

08:05.035 --> 08:13.983
Well, a university library can do that, but a national archive library, they can't do that.

08:14.243 --> 08:18.387
Well, LC has discarded some things, you know, they'll admit... I know, yes.

08:19.728 --> 08:23.751
They're not proud of that, but they have, they have deaccessioned some things.

08:24.092 --> 08:26.994
That word isn't even in your vocabulary, isn't it, deaccessioned?

08:27.014 --> 08:33.540
No, and if you can imagine, this is, for instance, a book,

08:34.617 --> 08:37.841
But we will keep also distinction.

08:37.861 --> 08:39.222
The book and the election.

08:39.302 --> 08:44.428
And this, which you're showing me, is like, for the sake of my tape recorder, just the case.

08:44.689 --> 08:46.831
Yeah, we will keep also the case.

08:46.951 --> 08:58.324
Well, the Library of Congress, when a new book comes in, as a matter of policy, this is very interesting, because I was interviewing somebody there, and they had taken out my book, and there was my book.

08:59.065 --> 09:02.028
And I said, geez, what happened to the dust jacket?

09:02.649 --> 09:04.371
She said, oh, we throw away dust jackets.

09:04.874 --> 09:05.516
No, we don't.

09:05.876 --> 09:09.746
When the book comes in, they immediately remove the dust jacket.

09:11.189 --> 09:11.831
We keep it.

09:11.851 --> 09:12.211
We keep it.

09:12.231 --> 09:13.795
It's part of the book.

09:13.815 --> 09:15.239
It's part of the publication.

09:15.860 --> 09:22.596
And it's interesting for future researchers, perhaps.

09:22.998 --> 09:51.975
because for instance you can follow the developing of those dust keepers dust jackets and how they develop from the color from the material oh i agree from the the paintings not only that there's very interesting biographical material right that you that you can find no place else and especially you find in early novels like faulkner you'll find somebody else some great author saying something about this author yeah

09:52.259 --> 09:55.382
that they published on the jacket that you can't find anyplace else.

09:55.703 --> 10:00.247
It's very, very worthwhile as a researcher.

10:00.267 --> 10:04.191
That's what we think, and for that reason we keep it.

10:04.372 --> 10:11.179
Well, so all right, what if now there seems to be a trend today where they will publish books with different covers?

10:11.599 --> 10:13.982
You'll have one with a red cover, one with a green cover.

10:15.543 --> 10:19.988
Biggest marketing seems to indicate that this works.

10:21.149 --> 10:23.651
try and get examples of all the different covers?

10:24.012 --> 10:24.512
Of course.

10:24.793 --> 10:25.153
You will.

10:25.613 --> 10:26.995
If you know about it, obviously.

10:27.015 --> 10:35.683
Well, I'm not sure whether we really will do that in all cases.

10:36.704 --> 10:46.654
But I think we will do it, of course, for examples, for having examples of these things.

10:46.674 --> 10:49.857
And one of our...

10:51.203 --> 10:59.878
Partners is the so-called Stiftung Buchkunst.

11:00.038 --> 11:09.795
It's a foundation which deals with art of making books and design of books.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.299
What was the name of the organization?

11:12.480 --> 11:13.802
Stiftung Buchkunst.

11:14.255 --> 11:23.447
It's part of our library, so you will have it in your... If you get the information, it will be... This is great.

11:23.948 --> 11:25.490
I'm glad I came.

11:25.590 --> 11:26.531
This is very important.

11:26.631 --> 11:34.742
So you can see examples in the exhibition at the moment.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.683
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:35.703 --> 11:42.372
We had an exhibition done by the Stiftung Buchkunst, but now they change it for the Book Fair.

11:42.807 --> 11:45.270
which is coming next year.

11:45.931 --> 11:48.654
Are you a librarian by training?

11:49.315 --> 11:50.557
I'm a librarian, yeah.

11:50.577 --> 12:06.377
Well, in Germany, it's a little bit difficult to say I'm a librarian because we have, in our education, we have three possibilities to be a librarian.

12:06.457 --> 12:10.182
Shortly after school, high school,

12:10.651 --> 12:16.921
You can have two years education to be a librarian of a lower level.

12:17.722 --> 12:21.267
Then after, it's three years now?

12:21.387 --> 12:23.491
But we don't do it, so.

12:23.511 --> 12:31.643
Well, and a second possibility was to have your, what we call, abitur.

12:32.324 --> 12:37.452
That means, well, the last examination in school.

12:38.377 --> 12:45.546
you have to go to school 13 years, then you have an examination, and this examination allows you to study.

12:47.609 --> 12:52.936
It's not comparable to college or something.

12:52.956 --> 12:58.263
Because in the apprenticeship and internship.

12:58.283 --> 12:58.463
Yeah.

13:00.386 --> 13:03.169
Yes, you need it just to study at the university.

13:03.189 --> 13:05.092
I see.

13:05.112 --> 13:08.316
And then you can study

13:08.482 --> 13:36.801
in a three year time for librarianship and then you are a librarian of a middle degree or something like that so your background also is a librarian and then the third possibilities and that is what I did you have to study a normal study

13:37.642 --> 13:43.088
For instance, I studied civil engineering and afterwards few sciences.

13:44.429 --> 13:50.576
And then you have to do two years education.

13:51.817 --> 13:52.838
It's a long time.

13:53.139 --> 13:53.819
It's a long time.

13:53.839 --> 13:56.482
You know, in the United States, library schools are disappearing.

13:56.963 --> 13:57.744
They're closing them.

13:58.605 --> 14:06.433
And the places that are replacing them are, they call them information schools, where the focus is entirely on computers and stuff like that.

14:06.751 --> 14:11.419
So there really is a movement away from book culture as we know it.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.646
I think it will be the same development in Germany.

14:15.686 --> 14:17.829
You can see it in some parts already.

14:18.390 --> 14:29.389
So it's more to information handling and such things than to real library science.

14:29.589 --> 14:32.013
You can't avoid it, can you?

14:32.333 --> 14:33.315
No, no, no.

14:33.700 --> 14:41.308
And I think this development is important, but you have to keep, of course, parts of what we call library science.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.091
You will have books.

14:44.732 --> 15:02.931
And if you see at the moment that we have a yearly 300,000 things coming in in our library, and only 5% of these

15:04.548 --> 15:12.797
300,000, at the highest, I would say, 5%, are electronic publications.

15:12.937 --> 15:15.580
Yeah, of course.

15:16.361 --> 15:20.946
I think it's around, not more than 10,000 a year.

15:20.966 --> 15:24.269
A week ago, a month ago, I was in San Francisco for a week.

15:24.309 --> 15:28.974
I don't know if you've been following what's been going on out there with their libraries, a big story.

15:29.335 --> 15:30.616
They built a new library.

15:31.317 --> 15:34.200
The day it opened, they didn't have enough room for all the books.

15:35.159 --> 15:42.288
They sent 200,000 books to the landfill, to the dump, and this is a public library.

15:43.189 --> 15:47.875
Of course, the fellow who built this place wanted the library of the future.

15:48.075 --> 15:53.722
I mean, the attitude there was computers and electronics.

15:53.742 --> 16:04.115
We want to be the library of the future, of course, but on the other hand side, we see that there are still books, and we have to keep them.

16:04.135 --> 16:04.896
And this is...

16:05.585 --> 16:18.059
Our idea is to have books and electronic information on the same level, I have to say.

16:18.079 --> 16:21.283
This is Germany where the printing press was invented.

16:22.645 --> 16:24.066
I'm going there this afternoon.

16:24.307 --> 16:25.608
I think this is very important.

16:26.429 --> 16:31.495
It would be horrific if this were the country that we're moving away from the printed book.

16:31.895 --> 16:35.119
It really pleases me to see that it's just the opposite.

16:35.926 --> 16:36.647
That's great.

16:36.927 --> 16:37.728
Good.

16:38.089 --> 16:41.873
I think that's all I can talk about.

16:41.893 --> 16:43.596
Do you have your email addresses here?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.017
It's on this card.

16:45.037 --> 16:51.505
And so if I have any questions, I can... You're welcome to do this.

16:51.986 --> 16:52.366
Thank you.

16:53.608 --> 16:54.589
So, thank you.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.373
You said it's done like a landscape.

16:57.393 --> 17:00.336
We're talking about the reading rooms?

17:00.457 --> 17:03.841
The upper floor is called the Pediatrics.

17:03.861 --> 17:05.663
We offer about 800

17:06.638 --> 17:12.063
Periodic is just for the users, they can sell themselves.

17:14.426 --> 17:27.479
In the main floor, it's mainly a reference library, catalog, working sources, and table sports.

17:27.499 --> 17:32.364
And bounce class, it's a multimedia reading room.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.526
So it's on several levels actually.

17:34.726 --> 17:35.667
Yes, it's three.

17:35.917 --> 17:45.996
In this panel downstairs is the entrance to the Jan Exile Archive.

17:46.938 --> 17:48.921
When was that established?

17:48.941 --> 17:52.107
It was established quite early.

17:52.127 --> 17:55.714
We started with the Dolce, we were taking time at about 46.

17:57.230 --> 18:12.092
And it's, I don't know exactly, because we have no exact base form of foundation, and since it was quite a cause of the Second World War, and things started any time.

18:12.452 --> 18:16.518
But it was a library material from that period, would you say?

18:16.839 --> 18:22.027
Yes, but the library itself starts collecting from the 8th of May, 1945.

18:22.387 --> 18:27.034
But this material is from 1933,

18:27.385 --> 18:30.369
This material we know?

18:30.730 --> 18:32.352
The German Exile Archive.

18:32.452 --> 18:36.338
That I would really like to see actually.

18:36.438 --> 18:40.183
Yes, very good.

18:41.224 --> 18:46.812
I tried to make a date.

18:47.693 --> 18:56.025
And that we have still books and not only online conversations.

18:56.343 --> 19:19.887
we wanted to explain him the importance of books fast and the we have a competition and we got the books not the contents but the

19:20.440 --> 19:29.030
The design, the book as an object, as an artifact.

19:29.811 --> 19:42.846
So all of these books we're looking at here are entries into a competition, is that what it is?

19:42.926 --> 19:43.607
Yes, that's right.

19:44.528 --> 19:48.473
It's about 700 books every year, 700 to 800 books.

19:48.740 --> 19:50.262
And you pick winners?

19:51.203 --> 19:54.727
We pick winners at 50, about 50 every year.

19:55.548 --> 19:56.930
And we have a jury.

19:57.650 --> 19:59.232
And various criteria.

19:59.272 --> 20:03.357
So the winners in some... Well, what are the different criteria?

20:03.557 --> 20:06.160
Is it for design?

20:06.401 --> 20:08.723
Do you understand a little bit, Julie?

20:08.743 --> 20:09.805
Yes, I will gift you.

20:09.925 --> 20:10.305
Okay.

20:10.325 --> 20:13.849
Yes, if you have a... Yes, my daughter speaks perfect.

20:13.869 --> 20:15.751
My daughter speaks perfect, Julie.

20:15.771 --> 20:16.232
So she...

20:17.377 --> 20:18.378
Categories, I guess.

20:18.398 --> 20:19.480
Categories, yes.

20:19.580 --> 20:23.125
I can't remember the special words.

20:23.185 --> 20:27.411
Printing and reproduction.

20:27.431 --> 20:28.373
Reproduction.

20:28.473 --> 20:29.675
I can get some of this.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.337
Binding, paper.

20:31.437 --> 20:33.019
Yes, I understand this.

20:33.079 --> 20:37.426
This is the technique and this is conception.

20:37.706 --> 20:44.936
I understand more than I realize.

20:45.016 --> 20:46.118
May I have this?

20:46.351 --> 21:04.790
And the jury makes the signs in this paper, and the sender of the book gets a copy of this testy.

21:07.152 --> 21:11.717
So this is done under the auspices of the Younger Descimation here.

21:11.849 --> 21:18.780
This is done under the auspices of the library, or this foundation is independent of the library?

21:19.702 --> 21:27.073
No, it's independent, but it gets money from different... Please pay it.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.155
It's okay.

21:28.175 --> 21:32.021
My bones are traveling all day.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.487
I can't sit over.

21:35.627 --> 21:39.493
I'm sitting all the day now.

21:40.503 --> 21:45.250
The man comes from the towns of Frankfurt and Leipzig.

21:45.430 --> 21:50.898
We have also some fondants in Leipzig.

21:50.978 --> 21:56.066
From Börsenverein of Deutschen Buchhandels and Deutsche Bibliothek.

21:56.246 --> 22:04.718
Well, what's interesting is, as Professor Neiman pointed out this morning, this library originally was founded through the efforts of the publishers.

22:05.419 --> 22:05.599
Yes.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.422
So this would be almost...

22:08.735 --> 22:16.503
they would really be very supportive of a competition that would recognize excellence in bookmaking, I guess.

22:16.523 --> 22:18.905
So it's consistent with everything that you've done.

22:18.925 --> 22:24.190
I think the start of the Stiftung Buchkunst was done by the Börsenverein, too.

22:24.231 --> 22:25.171
Yes, the Bukra.

22:25.492 --> 22:26.753
Yes.

22:27.053 --> 22:28.034
It was in the 20s.

22:28.575 --> 22:29.496
No, no, no.

22:29.816 --> 22:34.481
No, the Bukra, this big exhibition.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.743
Ah, Bukra.

22:36.763 --> 22:38.725
Bukra, that's right.

22:39.683 --> 22:46.569
But this organization, like we are here, is founded in 1951.

22:47.470 --> 22:47.850
Really?

22:48.391 --> 22:50.653
It took quite some time.

22:50.673 --> 22:51.814
Yes.

22:52.774 --> 23:01.963
I have in my mind that there was in the 20th an exhibition in Leipzig about Bug and Grafik.

23:02.783 --> 23:08.188
And this exhibition was prepared

23:08.776 --> 23:11.300
I suppose by the time.

23:13.322 --> 23:17.528
And I think this was the beginning of the competition.

23:17.568 --> 23:25.599
There was a competition beginning 1928 to 1932.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.084
Four competitions.

23:29.325 --> 23:34.692
And then it was forbidden by the Ritterreich Nazi regime.

23:35.373 --> 23:36.775
Why would they forbid it?

23:37.362 --> 23:40.566
Oh, you know, books are very dangerous and pictures.

23:40.887 --> 23:41.187
Yes.

23:41.688 --> 23:47.916
And then a new beginning started in the Philippines.

23:49.018 --> 23:54.104
Here and also parallels in Eastern Germany.

23:54.125 --> 23:57.729
And since 1989 we are together.

23:58.410 --> 24:01.775
Good.

24:01.795 --> 24:02.856
Excellent.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.939
Are you coming to the book fair this year?

24:05.037 --> 24:08.142
I was going to, but I think I'll come next year.

24:08.182 --> 24:14.873
This was more important to me, actually.

24:15.634 --> 24:20.602
The idea is to have books that correlate in an optimal manner with their contents.

24:20.622 --> 24:20.742
Yes.

24:21.504 --> 24:28.295
The outfit, the layout from the pages, the pictures.

24:29.436 --> 24:31.720
And so you were mentioning in children's books...

24:31.953 --> 24:35.057
They should be attractive, but they have to be sturdy, durable.

24:35.357 --> 24:37.059
Durable is probably the word.

24:40.843 --> 24:48.933
A beautiful book.

24:51.716 --> 25:00.306
That's a tough corner to make.

25:02.446 --> 25:11.222
The content goes together with the art of presentation.

25:11.622 --> 25:17.152
That's the Gutenberg Museum.

25:18.675 --> 25:24.505
Good.

25:25.295 --> 25:33.319
The British Library used American oak, actually.

25:33.681 --> 25:35.366
This is beautiful.

25:35.386 --> 25:35.627
Oh, I can't.

25:35.647 --> 25:36.790
Anything is done from this place.

25:38.542 --> 25:41.906
We are now under the earth.

25:41.926 --> 25:46.891
And the region of the rocks are quite large fields.

25:46.911 --> 25:48.813
It's about 10,000 meters in square.

25:48.953 --> 25:49.514
I see.

25:49.534 --> 25:55.180
And because the distances are very long, we have those materials.

25:55.360 --> 26:01.106
These are little vehicles, so like... Yes, electric.

26:01.126 --> 26:01.967
Like an auto scooter.

26:02.808 --> 26:18.245
Professor Lehman said I could take a few pictures, do you mind?

26:18.766 --> 26:21.272
Say again please.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.052
The point of the Deutsche Bibliothek.

26:26.072 --> 26:37.002
The idea of the Deutsche Bibliothek is to collect everything that is published in Germany, that is published in German language.

26:37.022 --> 26:37.883
Just keep talking.

26:37.903 --> 26:40.406
This is going, so I think it's taping.

26:40.426 --> 26:43.168
I'm just going to take a picture of the... While you talk, go ahead.

26:43.409 --> 26:50.735
And so we have a lot of things that will never be used, that will never be erased.

26:51.576 --> 26:52.457
And it could be...

26:52.927 --> 27:00.578
too much effort to find a systematic way of teaching the books.

27:00.598 --> 27:08.609
What I want to do is get a picture there of some of the coding on it.

27:08.910 --> 27:11.153
So you understand that these books will never be read?

27:12.515 --> 27:14.898
We just know it from experience.

27:15.619 --> 27:21.988
And if you look through the title, it will never be used.

27:22.542 --> 27:26.707
How can you tell that from the title, that it will never be used?

27:26.928 --> 27:43.609
Oh, we have a lot of religious books, or school books, or how to manage some obscure things, or editorial things, or poems.

27:44.450 --> 27:48.195
And our pastors, over here,

27:49.188 --> 27:52.613
It can be used only by scientific people.

27:53.254 --> 28:08.655
So, scientific students and teachers and so on will never, probably, never come into such a thing.

28:08.815 --> 28:10.337
You're a very famous author.

28:10.357 --> 28:10.958
Of course, yes.

28:11.098 --> 28:17.727
But I'm sure there are a lot of things

28:18.382 --> 28:19.884
So this is very easy for me.

28:20.105 --> 28:21.186
This is D74.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.890
That's the 15,547th book.

28:24.351 --> 28:27.857
It's just so ridiculously easy.

28:28.598 --> 28:30.541
So you really do need computers for this.

28:34.086 --> 28:35.308
And what do you call this system?

28:35.408 --> 28:37.411
That's your system, right?

28:37.431 --> 28:37.772
Numerous current.

28:37.792 --> 28:40.095
Say again, I'm sorry?

28:40.115 --> 28:40.776
Numerous current.

28:40.856 --> 28:42.759
N-U-M, numerals.

28:43.501 --> 28:43.601
Yes.

28:43.621 --> 28:44.442
What was the second word?

28:46.946 --> 28:47.106
C-U-R-R.

28:48.217 --> 28:52.283
C-U-R-R, yeah.

28:52.303 --> 28:54.326
What does that mean, I wonder?

28:55.768 --> 28:57.490
Oh, current, current.

28:57.751 --> 28:59.633
Current, yeah, current numerals.

28:59.774 --> 29:02.517
It probably means chronological, is what it means.

29:02.778 --> 29:07.845
The only difference we make is we separate books that are bigger.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.508
By size.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.751
By size, they are in another.

29:12.492 --> 29:14.414
But do they still keep the same number?

29:14.694 --> 29:19.879
They keep the... But we have one more character.

29:19.899 --> 29:21.361
Which indicates where it is.

29:21.461 --> 29:22.142
Indicates it.

29:22.162 --> 29:23.123
Where it is, yeah.

29:23.844 --> 29:27.628
We have now changed since the unification is like this.

29:27.688 --> 29:31.872
We changed the number, but we still retain.

29:33.634 --> 29:38.119
We now do not use any longer the theme.

29:38.723 --> 29:45.389
But instead of the D, we have 1974.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.171
So why don't you use D?

29:48.172 --> 29:52.135
Oh, because that just applies to here, probably.

29:52.376 --> 29:54.738
What's the number of the letter you use now?

29:54.918 --> 30:03.165
We have now, for instance, one, nine, nine, seven, eight, two, three, four, five, six.

30:03.185 --> 30:03.566
Okay.

30:04.246 --> 30:05.768
So this is the year.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.190
The character...

30:08.761 --> 30:15.211
A means this size, and this is the current size.

30:15.833 --> 30:27.131
And we will have perhaps B, which is bigger size, and we have some special for the cards and places and things like that.

30:27.151 --> 30:28.193
Amazingly efficient.

30:28.854 --> 30:30.376
But it's very efficient.

30:30.857 --> 30:32.620
Everybody knows what it is.

30:33.862 --> 30:34.583
That's great.

30:35.069 --> 30:38.173
See, I wouldn't know this if you didn't bring me down here.

30:41.697 --> 30:43.038
What do you think?

30:43.058 --> 30:54.812
If you use any system at it, you have to keep... Space.

30:55.012 --> 30:55.152
Space.

30:55.252 --> 30:56.654
And you know, library has another space now.

30:56.674 --> 30:57.955
See, D75, that's 1975, 76, 77.

30:57.975 --> 31:01.059
So what I'm looking at is D75.

31:01.399 --> 31:03.642
It goes all the way down to...

31:04.313 --> 31:13.301
So 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 7, 9, 80, 80, 280, down there, and then it comes back to 85.

31:14.922 --> 31:19.967
So you cover really 10 years here.

31:19.987 --> 31:20.067
Yes.

31:20.427 --> 31:28.154
At the end of the house, we cover the first 30 years.

31:28.174 --> 31:31.517
We start in this corner with the left side down with 9 to 45.

31:31.537 --> 31:34.219
It's only one and a half meters.

31:34.857 --> 31:38.522
And these are all books published in Germany in that year.

31:41.026 --> 31:54.626
So, this is the beginning of our collection.

31:55.126 --> 31:55.627
Racine.

31:57.930 --> 31:58.631
Racine.

31:59.913 --> 32:00.794
Phaedra.

32:01.536 --> 32:03.278
So, Racine, Phaedra.

32:04.169 --> 32:09.615
I just, I wonder what number it is, that's why, so it's D46536.

32:10.596 --> 32:18.325
And this is his cool textbook.

32:22.530 --> 32:22.910
Perfect.

32:24.031 --> 32:24.412
Perfect.

32:25.613 --> 32:28.556
Now that's, see this is the kind of stuff I'm interested in.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.919
And really, I know it sounds crazy.

32:31.237 --> 32:33.800
But believe me, it's going to make for a very good book.

32:34.200 --> 32:40.827
Yeah, I think it's always the practice that's important, not the huge idea.

32:40.847 --> 32:43.109
This is the way Samuel Pepys kept his library.

32:43.469 --> 32:44.090
Did you know that?

32:44.791 --> 32:46.653
He actually shelved it according to size.

32:46.893 --> 32:48.314
The title meant nothing.

32:48.334 --> 32:51.517
All the little ones started here, and they went all the way up to the big ones.

32:51.958 --> 32:56.202
But then he had a catalog of how you went to find them.

32:57.423 --> 32:58.965
The only difficulty is,

32:59.283 --> 33:07.554
If you change in your mind the numbers and put it on the wrong face, you will never find it again.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.824
So it is so important to have skilled people.

33:16.346 --> 33:16.567
Yes.

33:16.587 --> 33:18.289
You must be very careful.

33:18.309 --> 33:19.471
Cushion is the word.

33:19.491 --> 33:20.132
Yes.

33:20.152 --> 33:21.253
And does that happen often?

33:24.918 --> 33:27.762
We miss something.

33:27.782 --> 33:28.463
Maybe...

33:28.713 --> 33:41.362
That's why you'll never find it if you put it in the wrong place.

33:41.663 --> 33:46.975
Yeah, but there's no, it could be because it's random in terms of

33:48.794 --> 34:04.810
You have no idea where it could be put, because there's nothing... Under 47, you can have it under 1,000... There's no way to know, and there's no way to look because it's not alphabetical and it's not by subject.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.271
No, no.

34:06.291 --> 34:13.098
We should control books like that.

34:13.118 --> 34:14.599
So it's here and the current family.

34:14.917 --> 34:39.726
but what i what i like very much from this point of view this is the literature from 46 45 47 it's gray and brown and have a look over there it's called the 74 it's colored in those task uh yes people no no dust

34:40.364 --> 34:41.125
Dust jackets.

34:41.185 --> 34:46.572
Dust wrappers, they say in... That's a funny word.

34:46.893 --> 34:51.319
That's what we say in America, but I think in Britain they call them wrappers.

34:53.301 --> 34:57.026
They just call them wrappers in England, but we call them dust jackets.

34:58.428 --> 34:59.290
D-U-S-T.

35:00.451 --> 35:02.534
No, the English word.

35:02.654 --> 35:03.075
Wrappers.

35:03.455 --> 35:07.080
W-R-A-P-P.

35:07.853 --> 35:08.454
E.R.S.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.835
You wrap it like a wrapper.

35:10.615 --> 35:13.418
And then we call it a dust jacket.

35:13.438 --> 35:18.042
I think it's a very describing word.

35:18.062 --> 35:18.983
It is, yeah.

35:19.003 --> 35:20.984
Well, it's a metaphor, actually.

35:21.665 --> 35:26.949
And I think you have time enough and you... A little dust?

35:27.170 --> 35:27.890
Sacred dust.

35:27.930 --> 35:35.537
That looks nice.

35:36.497 --> 35:37.118
So I think

35:37.418 --> 35:46.552
and how to do, those subjects are very important.

35:46.712 --> 36:05.181
And the texts that I've written here, sometimes it's short, or some other poets that write, some words too.

36:08.232 --> 36:11.978
Well, it could be out, right?

36:14.401 --> 36:14.862
Yes.

36:14.882 --> 36:19.049
And there could be, just like that, as you call a deputy.

36:19.109 --> 36:21.973
Oh, so when a book is removed, you put in a deputy?

36:21.993 --> 36:25.559
Yes, you put in a deputy.

36:25.859 --> 36:34.392
And this should be one part of the landing paper, just to find an example.

36:35.873 --> 36:44.302
Look, that's good, that's good.

36:44.322 --> 36:45.703
This is a working deputy.

36:46.504 --> 36:53.532
This is the part of the lending piece that the user has to form.

36:56.234 --> 36:58.937
And then you know that a book belongs there when it comes back.

37:00.899 --> 37:02.361
Where are we standing right now?

37:02.661 --> 37:04.463
We have about two million items.

37:04.898 --> 37:06.279
And where are we just again?

37:06.680 --> 37:09.802
We are in the first underground floor.

37:10.042 --> 37:11.344
First underground floor.

37:12.505 --> 37:13.686
Two million items.

37:13.746 --> 37:15.327
And how many underground floors do you have?

37:15.347 --> 37:17.369
We have three of them.

37:17.989 --> 37:20.852
The third is absolutely empty.

37:20.872 --> 37:26.737
And the second is about half empty.

37:26.757 --> 37:27.398
Okay, good.

37:27.778 --> 37:28.639
Back to the future.

37:28.659 --> 37:32.482
2040.

37:32.502 --> 37:33.623
That's what they told me, yeah.

37:35.138 --> 37:38.181
One of seven fictions.

37:38.922 --> 37:43.207
Hold this again to me, please.

37:43.227 --> 37:45.950
Can I take a picture?

37:47.932 --> 37:48.113
Okay.

37:48.133 --> 37:48.373
Good.

37:48.913 --> 37:54.720
Come on now.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.263
It's my daughter's camera.

38:02.349 --> 38:02.749
Why isn't it?

38:05.699 --> 38:07.681
See, I should have brought my Nikons after all.

38:10.425 --> 38:22.159
I wanted to get those numbers, but that's okay.

38:22.179 --> 38:28.247
I'm going to get myself a Leica.

38:28.717 --> 38:53.053
before i go back i think they're very they're very reasonably priced here but a little leica that i that i can carry with me on these trips because when i'm writing these pictures are very useful they don't have to be beautiful it's just it's just visual it gives me the colors gives me uh you know when you have a picture of it it's uh

38:56.341 --> 38:58.163
It's so heavy.

38:58.183 --> 39:01.006
The ritual on it, this is the, you know, like this stuff.

39:03.029 --> 39:03.509
Oh, yes.

39:04.991 --> 39:05.772
Yes, you can have this.

39:05.792 --> 39:06.593
Can I have this?

39:07.134 --> 39:07.734
Yes.

39:07.754 --> 39:11.439
This is not from our library, but... I can take it.

39:14.622 --> 39:14.722
Yeah.

39:14.742 --> 39:15.643
John, there's passos.

39:16.785 --> 39:20.950
What is this stuff, I wonder?

39:21.010 --> 39:24.694
I think it's just a prospect to offer.

39:30.277 --> 39:36.925
I can take some of these, right?

39:38.788 --> 39:47.378
I like different things.

39:48.119 --> 39:55.048
And this explains what this unit is all about, right?

39:55.168 --> 39:57.010
So can I take these two?

39:58.677 --> 40:28.414
one of each I like my daughter's I think that's the same oh that's the same no that's different that's this process and that's that's got two different titles oh it is okay yep yep yep we're looking at a different size so this this um where are the material so this is a card catalog the last part of the card catalog indeed the materials are special stocks behind this one I see so this was and this is a this is a vault

40:30.689 --> 40:39.345
Hello, I see.

40:39.385 --> 40:41.790
This is manuscript material.

40:43.373 --> 40:53.912
Could you show me, give me an example of what's in here?

40:54.348 --> 41:23.292
but I have a lot of important important things here but I have a lot of important things here I have a lot of important things here I have a lot of important things here in Rabensbrück and Trader and Margarete Uwe Neumann schreibt which is also perfect but that is what modern is also what new is but we have a lot of important things

41:25.027 --> 41:35.958
So this is more or less the vault, right?

41:36.038 --> 41:38.601
This is the rare material that's in here?

41:39.682 --> 41:41.724
Yes, the imprinted.

41:42.285 --> 41:52.976
And the most expensive glass are... ...all the famous of Einstein.

41:53.276 --> 41:53.937
Really?

41:54.423 --> 41:59.410
Where was this material acquired?

41:59.430 --> 42:03.976
I mean, it was purchased, or it was... How do you get exiled materials, I wonder?

42:04.497 --> 42:06.560
Bought by Professor Nahles.

42:06.580 --> 42:09.264
It is an opera.

42:09.284 --> 42:14.451
If somebody dies, the family gives up what the author left behind.

42:14.511 --> 42:18.697
And we buy it at auctions.

42:18.917 --> 42:21.140
Some people offer it for us.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.063
And we have Mrs. Barnett.

42:23.735 --> 42:25.017
in the United States.

42:25.537 --> 42:27.019
He's always looking.

42:27.079 --> 42:28.661
What's his name?

42:28.802 --> 42:30.424
He is here at the moment.

42:30.724 --> 42:31.665
Today he is here.

42:31.705 --> 42:38.494
I won't be able to see him.

42:38.574 --> 42:40.937
What's his name?

42:41.838 --> 42:43.661
S-P-A-M-E.

42:44.161 --> 42:46.364
So this is called the exile?

42:46.985 --> 42:48.127
German exile archive.

42:48.287 --> 42:49.608
Okay.

42:50.069 --> 42:52.272
You'll find something in this.

42:52.292 --> 42:52.392
Okay.

42:56.675 --> 43:06.410
This is a special library in the library.

43:06.771 --> 43:07.532
I love vaults.

43:08.334 --> 43:20.393
Yeah.

43:20.653 --> 43:21.214
Yeah.

43:21.565 --> 43:50.880
good good okay sorry to the wish institute i'm sorry no it's a pc i see okay um and they have an online catalog oh that's the leo beck institute that's what you're saying yes

43:51.822 --> 43:55.866
And they do the same stuff, right?

43:55.926 --> 43:56.707
The same material.

43:59.970 --> 44:00.711
I'll talk to them.

44:00.731 --> 44:10.101
I wish they'll be able to tell me about this, huh?

44:18.229 --> 44:18.910
Okay.

44:19.413 --> 44:34.879
I take everything.

44:34.960 --> 44:38.706
Everything you let me have, I can take.

44:38.746 --> 44:41.351
Did I get everything that they were going to give me, these press kits, right?

44:41.371 --> 44:43.715
Yes, I think that's the most, yes.

44:43.735 --> 44:45.117
Okay, good, good.

44:45.282 --> 44:50.830
a book that informs about the Deutsche Bibliothek.

44:51.410 --> 45:06.531
So I think it's a small exhibition, the things this department has done, and they told me here are... This is Exile Literature again.

45:06.832 --> 45:17.148
And here we have a telephone from Arnold Zweif.

45:17.168 --> 45:21.514
Joseph Roth, Einstein.

45:21.534 --> 45:31.650
Pen Club in Exile.

45:32.070 --> 45:33.312
Where is it?

45:33.848 --> 45:37.214
Albert Einstein to Paul Frankel, Princeton, 1944.

45:37.274 --> 45:41.161
February 27, 1944.

45:44.808 --> 45:45.730
What's the content?

45:45.910 --> 45:47.974
What is he writing about, I wonder?

45:54.686 --> 45:57.291
They talk about a plan.

45:58.840 --> 46:03.829
Then Paul Francis sent a brochure to Einstein.

46:04.610 --> 46:08.096
I mean, does it deal with the war, because the war is still going on at this point?

46:09.599 --> 46:09.839
Yes.

46:12.463 --> 46:18.814
They suppose one government for all over the world.

46:19.596 --> 46:20.738
So he's proposing one?

46:20.758 --> 46:23.262
He's proposing something.

46:23.950 --> 46:28.434
A single government, a single world government, which we're never going to see.

46:28.854 --> 46:45.168
But there, he's realistic enough to say that the single states will not give part of their power to such a central government of the world.

46:51.474 --> 46:53.856
It's just an idea.

46:56.030 --> 47:05.360
that this is a recognition of things that happened in history that you're acknowledging with the future.

47:05.621 --> 47:21.058
We collect these things that were published before the end of the second world, despite of the fact that the collection is such an author.

47:22.658 --> 47:36.372
The first director of the Dwarf Review was so he knew the problem concerning all the Jewish people.

47:36.452 --> 47:49.105
And I think that's why he became the first officer from friends, political friends, and he offered them their materials and materials.

47:50.536 --> 47:55.661
So this is not meant to be a definitive library in any way.

47:55.822 --> 48:05.512
It's still growing slowly, but there are still some pieces found that we will not have until now.

48:05.532 --> 48:11.078
I think it's the biggest collection of these materials.

48:11.098 --> 48:20.087
And I think it's important that the government recognizes it so that this is done as a matter of government policy.

48:20.287 --> 48:41.437
We had the official opening of the library, and he was shown things too, and he was shown a letter he wrote himself when men died and he had written to the widow.

48:44.881 --> 48:47.765
Very good.

48:47.785 --> 48:48.927
To build a library?

48:49.092 --> 49:13.979
You can build a house, you can enjoy the art of the library, and the idea is to build with it.

49:13.999 --> 49:15.420
And so, the contents of what the library needs are its contents.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.103
And his idea was, or when he thinks the word, or hears the word library, he imagines or has a huge wall.

49:18.387 --> 49:24.173
The witcher?

49:24.193 --> 49:27.717
Baroque.

49:27.737 --> 49:30.539
This will be the architect talking?

49:31.280 --> 49:31.981
Baroque.

49:32.101 --> 49:43.753
We offer here some reference findings.

49:44.982 --> 49:45.703
It's beautiful.

49:45.723 --> 49:46.404
It's really lovely.

49:46.785 --> 49:47.265
Look at that.

49:47.285 --> 49:48.007
It's wonderful.

49:48.067 --> 49:50.470
Wonderful.

49:51.392 --> 49:53.675
My wife always says, if you can take enough pictures.

49:55.918 --> 49:56.940
So I'm taking more.

49:58.302 --> 49:59.284
That's nice.

49:59.304 --> 50:01.226
I know it's awkward, but this is the way I always am.

50:02.428 --> 50:03.370
This is so beautiful.

50:07.856 --> 50:08.477
Come on now.

50:08.798 --> 50:13.305
Why isn't he taking the picture?

50:13.325 --> 50:13.605
You should go.

50:13.703 --> 50:16.628
Okay.

50:16.648 --> 50:18.490
Oh, that might even be better.

50:23.038 --> 50:30.870
I work with photographs, with tapes, and with notes.

50:31.050 --> 50:34.135
Can I have my notebook?

50:34.195 --> 50:36.218
I'll just write some notes too.

50:38.695 --> 51:04.483
every one of these books that i write this is now about the 40th notebook i have just for this book and then i have a whole my whole house is my whole basement is filled with materials this is really gorgeous congratulations it's striking we have an elevator in the middle you know

51:09.172 --> 51:23.166
It's very busy too.

51:26.855 --> 51:26.995
Mm-hmm.

51:38.247 --> 51:58.695
One more shot, and that'll be it.

51:58.715 --> 51:59.516
I'm going to do the whole hole, 25 feet.

51:59.536 --> 52:07.366
I won't do anything.

52:07.386 --> 52:07.967
I'm just going to hear it.

52:08.200 --> 52:23.395
Oh, concrete.

52:23.896 --> 52:34.086
Concrete, glass, wood, and we have metal.

52:34.106 --> 52:37.549
Concrete, glass, wood, and steel, I guess.

52:45.815 --> 53:08.785
of course but it's with a very nice tones too they're not a very very dark

53:22.332 --> 53:27.322
Until today, that's pretty good.

53:27.944 --> 53:35.279
Well, that's the idea.

53:40.329 --> 53:42.073
This is your courtyard here.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.716
This is the last picture.

53:50.885 --> 53:57.391
Now it's rewinding.

53:57.511 --> 54:08.482
But it's not a professional camera.

54:11.265 --> 54:14.808
But Nikon, Leica makes one like this for professionals.

54:16.330 --> 54:19.913
And the Contax is a beautiful German camera too.

54:25.563 --> 54:31.308
I have them from this.

54:31.348 --> 54:32.009
My favorites.

54:33.210 --> 54:36.093
My favorite cameras are the ones I got in the 1960s.

54:36.814 --> 54:38.675
Two Nikons, which I got overseas.

54:44.641 --> 54:45.162
Oh, sure.

54:45.402 --> 54:45.702
Right here.

54:45.722 --> 54:53.089
Look at that.

54:53.407 --> 54:57.578
You see the conception from it.
