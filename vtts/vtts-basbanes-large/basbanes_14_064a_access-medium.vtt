WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:03.687
We're rolling now.

00:03.867 --> 00:04.127
Good.

00:04.147 --> 00:04.448
Okay.

00:04.949 --> 00:05.209
Go ahead.

00:07.714 --> 00:09.236
Well, what paradox?

00:10.038 --> 00:11.660
Why don't you say why you think there's a paradox?

00:11.861 --> 00:12.862
What is a paradox?

00:13.764 --> 00:14.946
Okay.

00:15.106 --> 00:19.554
I get the reaction a lot, but I find it useful to make people say, so what is it actually?

00:19.574 --> 00:26.005
Well, a person whose focus of study is classical.

00:25.985 --> 00:46.727
is the classics on the one hand, which seems to be as concerned as any academic discipline about where we're going with technology, particularly in terms of it also involved in the, I guess, and you do address this in your book, you know, the

00:47.281 --> 00:58.894
The great books debate, the canon debate, maybe the classics in some schools of thought will be slipping by the wayside with all of this.

00:58.914 --> 01:03.500
It seems, I guess on the face of it, it looks like a paradoxical situation.

01:04.441 --> 01:07.804
Well, let me point to something in that.

01:08.085 --> 01:12.630
Classics, in the first century AD, there were no classics.

01:14.686 --> 01:16.310
But no computers either.

01:17.232 --> 01:17.633
No computers either.

01:17.653 --> 01:18.875
But no classicist.

01:18.895 --> 01:27.775
Classicist is a category that only comes into existence when you're at a distance away from things that you're talking about.

01:28.316 --> 01:34.129
And even in sort of the most aggressive, fashionable rewritings of a canon,

01:34.885 --> 01:35.966
It's got to be published.

01:35.987 --> 01:40.112
It's got to be reached an audience before anybody's going to put it on a list.

01:40.132 --> 01:52.850
You don't put Don DeLillo's next unpublished book on your reading list until some audience has had a look at it and made sure that it's actually worth reading.

01:53.230 --> 02:01.281
In fact, Classicist, as we practice it, is very much a creature of the world of print, and it's really...

02:01.598 --> 02:07.187
Though we tell ourselves stories that kind of conflict with this, it's really a creature of the 19th and 20th century.

02:07.267 --> 02:21.430
The things we classics professors are, students of classics are, the things we do are heavily implicated in 19th and 20th century technology, culture, society, and so forth.

02:23.823 --> 02:37.162
The stuff I do with the picture of Jerome and so forth is a way of getting at how we build up stories for ourselves where we give ourselves more of a pedigree and stretch ourselves more into the past to think that we've always been.

02:38.504 --> 02:39.265
And we've been doing this.

02:39.665 --> 02:40.506
In fact, we're not.

02:41.268 --> 02:52.243
And I guess I would say that if I deceive myself into thinking that classicist is a very long-term kind of thing to be,

02:52.949 --> 03:03.681
And having deceived myself that way, then hang on fiercely to late 19th and early 20th century cultural and technological practices.

03:03.781 --> 03:13.953
I'm deceiving myself, and I'm pretty much guaranteeing myself obsolescence and irrelevance in pretty short order.

03:14.374 --> 03:20.020
If I change around my imagination of what I am and think of myself as somebody...

03:20.725 --> 03:45.585
studious about both ancient cultures and their cultural products and then reflecting intelligently on my own culture, which I think I ought to do if I'm going to study ancient culture responsibly and keep doing it, then the media of communication that I use, the tools that I use, are purely instrumental in that goal.

03:45.706 --> 03:46.547
I think the risk

03:47.776 --> 03:58.831
run when we become nostalgic is fetishizing the instrument and in so doing failing to let it help us get at the thing that it's supposed to help us.

03:58.851 --> 04:05.100
But I think that you discuss topics in this book.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.904
I mean, it seems to go beyond the fetishizing of an instrument.

04:08.004 --> 04:13.952
I mean, where the instrument itself actually is going to influence how the material...

04:14.168 --> 04:25.925
If you don't fetishize the instrument, you can become more conscious of what it is, different ways you could use it, things it does to the people who use it, things it does to the things you use it on.

04:28.288 --> 04:29.289
Let me give you an example.

04:31.172 --> 04:41.166
My friend Cassiodorus, whom I read about in there, he wrote a handbook of... It would make a great website, what it would make.

04:41.186 --> 04:42.348
Say again, I'm sorry?

04:42.368 --> 04:43.990
He wrote a handbook of

04:44.881 --> 04:49.807
It's a sort of bibliography of Christian study, as it was in his time in the 6th century AD.

04:50.608 --> 04:55.234
A handbook of scripture study, a handbook of all the things you needed to know in order to study scripture.

04:56.015 --> 05:02.003
And he was a book collector, and so he talked about the various books he had, and he even had little finding lists.

05:02.323 --> 05:05.347
And here are some more books that I'm sure would be very useful, but I haven't found copies yet.

05:06.188 --> 05:09.752
If anybody finds them, I'd be glad to know about it, and so forth.

05:09.772 --> 05:11.314
No kidding, this was in the 6th century?

05:11.334 --> 05:12.576
6th century, yeah.

05:13.096 --> 05:16.620
What was the title of this particular work?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.122
It's called Institutione.

05:18.222 --> 05:19.884
Okay, it was the Institutione.

05:19.904 --> 05:20.184
Okay.

05:23.068 --> 05:27.112
And it's a bibliography.

05:27.693 --> 05:42.310
It's a student's guidebook to studying everything you needed to know to be a learned and educated person by Cassiodora Flights, which was, to say, heavily involved in Christian studies and so forth.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.342
But here's the trick.

05:46.382 --> 05:56.574
When Cassiodorus wrote that book in the 6th century, he wrote it by hand, or scribes working for him actually wrote the copies that were in circulation.

05:56.594 --> 06:01.540
It was heavily illustrated, but illustrated with diagrams.

06:01.800 --> 06:09.850
He has seven chapters devoted to the seven liberal arts, how each one of the liberal arts can help you understand scripture, how understanding astronomy helps you understand scripture better.

06:10.775 --> 06:24.869
And so he has very schematic kinds of diagrams and categories, I think most easily of the ones in his book on logic, where he tells you the nine different kinds of one sort of argument and 12 different versions of a syllogism.

06:25.089 --> 06:26.731
Sixth century links, in other words.

06:28.833 --> 06:38.503
But what he did was he did what you'd find in a textbook today, diagrams where he's got the header is the name of the kind of argument, and there's 12 lines.

06:39.057 --> 06:43.661
on the page, branching out to the 12 types of argument.

06:44.162 --> 06:49.326
And then the text that follows will say argument number one is less and such argument, and number two is less and such and so forth.

06:49.346 --> 06:58.635
But the point was the page had this visual help to understanding the argument and remembering it.

06:58.655 --> 07:06.482
These were also illustrated so that there would be animals or human figures worked in to the diagram of the 12 kinds of argument.

07:07.542 --> 07:13.691
We discuss now whether, in fact, some of that was, how that was designed to make it easier to memorize this stuff, basically.

07:13.711 --> 07:15.374
How do you memorize a 12-hand argument?

07:15.394 --> 07:16.515
Did the diagram help?

07:17.256 --> 07:28.553
Were you remembering the diagram by remembering something about the animal whose picture was next to it, so that you knew that it was a deer next to the diagram about arguments?

07:28.673 --> 07:29.314
Well,

07:29.632 --> 07:30.834
Can I interject a question?

07:32.276 --> 07:36.061
You know this phrase, obviously you know this phrase, the authorial intention.

07:36.722 --> 07:51.642
Is it therefore essential if you're going to read Cassiodorus properly and completely that you read the full context, that it's not enough to have the text, the hypertext, I always say, but you have to have these illustrations and these drawings?

07:52.143 --> 07:54.426
Well, I would say so.

07:54.606 --> 07:56.729
I'd like you to see those, let's put it that way.

07:57.390 --> 07:59.453
But here's my point.

07:59.635 --> 08:04.541
This is a book that, for a variety of reasons, didn't get a lot of scholarly attention in early modern times.

08:05.202 --> 08:12.430
The only editions in print 65 years ago were quite bad 7th century editions.

08:12.591 --> 08:18.618
Somebody had one copy of the manuscript, transcribed off the text, printed it with a lot of errors, and had been reprinted many, many times.

08:18.778 --> 08:22.082
So there's a famous edition done in 1937 by an English scholar.

08:22.754 --> 08:27.059
which was vastly an improvement on all that went before.

08:27.079 --> 08:28.240
Is this a translation?

08:28.921 --> 08:29.962
No, an edition of the last.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.024
Okay, wait a second.

08:31.404 --> 08:42.417
He's gone back and looked at a whole bunch of manuscripts and did a much better job of analyzing and just reporting accurately what was in them, comparing them, correcting them, and so forth.

08:42.437 --> 08:49.285
But 1937, when you published a critical edition, what he did was eliminated all of the illustrations,

08:49.973 --> 08:51.396
And most of the diagrams.

08:51.416 --> 08:53.319
The diagrams didn't work for him.

08:53.339 --> 09:01.273
In 1937, he imagined his job as one that was putting the words in printed form.

09:02.395 --> 09:06.602
And when you've read the words in printed form, you've read the book.

09:06.622 --> 09:10.429
Well, scholarship on that text now gets at just the point you're making.

09:11.185 --> 09:19.259
If you're going to do a proper job of editing this book, you ought to realize that one of the things that comes with this book is diagrams.

09:19.279 --> 09:23.246
And you're not presenting the book until you show diagrams.

09:23.266 --> 09:25.169
Who is this scholar, the English scholar, by the way?

09:25.189 --> 09:30.578
His name is Minors, M-Y-N-O-R-S, by his initials R-A-B.

09:31.975 --> 09:34.979
I'm going to be at Widener today, maybe I'll see you.

09:35.039 --> 09:36.702
Roger Aubrey Baskerville Miners.

09:36.962 --> 09:43.291
Well, I will even, I should be, I'm going to make a couple of notes, and I will, you've got World Wide Web access tonight.

09:43.311 --> 09:43.932
I do, yeah.

09:44.092 --> 09:48.679
I'll make a couple of notes, and I've got a couple of these illustrations online.

09:48.699 --> 09:50.241
Oh, great, great.

09:50.261 --> 09:52.144
Terrific, yeah, excellent.

09:55.043 --> 09:57.647
I'm working on a book of my own right now.

09:58.588 --> 10:03.215
In fact, I'll ask a few questions a little bit later, even about St.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.619
Jerome.

10:07.362 --> 10:20.241
Anyway, my point is here that the original thing Cassiodorus wrote was written on parchment in the 6th century AD in one set of conditions of production and consumption of text.

10:20.626 --> 10:29.340
which happened to favor, as long as you were doing a book, which was a very expensive thing to do, doing it with illustrations and layout and presentation and so forth.

10:29.360 --> 10:36.792
The modern printed book has, on the other hand, this very austere aesthetic of black type on white pages.

10:36.832 --> 10:44.003
Illustrations somehow make a book less serious rather than more for us.

10:44.544 --> 10:48.490
And illuminated letters and that sort of thing are...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.257
fussy or expensive or something.

10:52.258 --> 10:57.406
And so we tended to prefer for a very long time the plain, simple black letters on white page.

10:57.966 --> 11:03.274
And you can get into arguments about that going back to all the Renaissance and so forth.

11:03.294 --> 11:16.333
With the World Wide Web, and I've got actually a friend in Milan who's talking about this, you can begin to imagine how if the printed book was one way of representing 6th century manuscript books,

11:16.904 --> 11:25.777
A worldwide web page could be another equally useful and in some ways better way of representing that 6th century manuscript book.

11:25.837 --> 11:27.660
You could actually see the whole darn thing.

11:27.680 --> 11:38.676
You could both have the deciphered text in Roman font that you can read easily, but next to it you can have a very high quality image of exactly the thing the guy produced.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.215
and let people get more directly at the book itself.

11:43.676 --> 11:57.238
When you start thinking that way, you realize that the printed book is not necessarily the only or the best or the most privileged form of representing information that didn't originally come in

11:57.775 --> 11:58.917
in printed book form.

11:59.297 --> 12:05.086
It's got strengths and it's got weaknesses and other tools will have their strengths and weaknesses too.

12:05.106 --> 12:06.909
This all goes back to your question about the paradox.

12:07.169 --> 12:09.152
Is it paradoxical for me to do this stuff?

12:09.172 --> 12:09.913
I don't think so.

12:10.254 --> 12:25.977
I'm greedy and curious and eager to know about these ancient things in every way I can and I see it as simply an interest in using every tool and technique that comes to hand to get at it.

12:26.294 --> 12:31.522
If you shouldn't fetishize the book, you also shouldn't fetishize the computer.

12:31.542 --> 12:38.372
There's no reason to say the computer is some magical, perfect, final, best of all possible tools for me.

12:38.392 --> 12:41.337
There are some things the printed book does better than the computer does.

12:42.519 --> 12:43.100
For instance?

12:44.382 --> 12:46.024
At the moment, walks around with you.

12:46.004 --> 12:51.669
Well, that's just mere function, though, I think, but not to be dismissed.

12:51.689 --> 12:53.952
I mean, to trivialize, but... Not to be dismissed.

12:53.972 --> 12:55.073
Well, but what's mere function?

12:55.153 --> 12:56.154
What's mere function?

12:57.335 --> 13:04.542
I got an email message from a former student the other day saying, Jim, it's great that your articles are up online, but we don't have that journal in our library.

13:04.582 --> 13:07.164
Couldn't have put the page numbers in it.

13:07.184 --> 13:09.927
Well, I said that's a lot better to work, and I don't like to get the page numbers that are up.

13:10.167 --> 13:15.572
But indeed, we have learned how to use the purely accidental fact

13:16.852 --> 13:28.125
that words regularly appear on the same page in every copy of a book, as a strategy, rough and ready, from an index and whatnot, and table book content, of getting at the information quite efficiently.

13:28.205 --> 13:34.112
And you and I are real good at picking up a book, looking at the table of content, looking at the index, browsing it quickly.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.777
We can find our way through a book really, really well.

13:38.337 --> 13:46.487
We don't yet have native forms of presentation of information from electronic media that I find as easy

13:46.771 --> 13:56.783
to take a quick glance at, to get a sense of what's going on there, to leap through, to browse, to have a sense that I've really looked at this thing and have an idea about what it is.

13:57.444 --> 14:03.532
It's even just hard when you look at links on a page to know which one is the article and which one is the book.

14:03.572 --> 14:08.798
If I go to the library, I can tell the difference between a six-volume book and a pamphlet right away.

14:10.120 --> 14:14.145
And I reach for one or the other depending on what I think I might want.

14:14.581 --> 14:15.444
We're not there yet.

14:15.905 --> 14:27.139
All of that is, in a way, incidental and contingent, and I'm sure electronic media will find various ways to do some of these things better and in more standardized ways as we go along.

14:27.592 --> 14:31.979
But on the other hand, I think the physical book will preserve.

14:31.999 --> 14:42.454
I think for the serious scholar, to go back to your example, the Cassiodorus, the manuscript copy there, and of course the computer can give you every page.

14:42.474 --> 14:47.001
I mean, it's just a question of accessibility.

14:46.981 --> 14:47.802
Another old paradox.

14:47.862 --> 14:49.344
But let me just finish here.

14:49.904 --> 14:55.651
But there are times when you, I think, absolutely have to have that artifact in hand.

14:55.671 --> 15:07.025
I mean, if you're talking about the color of the ink or you're talking about strikeovers or certain things that you absolutely have to examine the artifact, I think.

15:07.045 --> 15:10.348
There's actually a paradox of people observing it as they begin to make.

15:10.889 --> 15:13.392
One of the things that rare book librarians think is, oh, good.

15:14.033 --> 15:16.836
We can digitize images of all of our really precious stuff.

15:17.440 --> 15:24.689
and that will reduce the amount of wear and tear from idle users just coming by saying, oh, could I please see your fancy edition?

15:24.709 --> 15:28.614
But they don't let idle users.

15:29.556 --> 15:43.954
The problem is they're discovering that when you digitize images of your stuff, you're now making it readily available to a great many more people, and the actual traffic showing up at your desk saying, may I look at that rare edition of X is going up.

15:44.845 --> 15:51.176
Because more people have been able to process it without looking at it and actually have a serious reason now.

15:51.457 --> 15:53.701
They've seen something in the image and they want to look at it.

15:53.741 --> 15:54.943
Yeah, and it's not going to be browsing.

15:55.003 --> 15:57.748
I mean, they're going with a specific... Yeah, right.

15:57.768 --> 15:59.250
They're not just saying, can I please look at that?

15:59.271 --> 16:02.777
They're saying, I've got to look at Folio 94 on that one, please.

16:02.797 --> 16:04.660
Because they know what it is they're going and looking for.

16:04.910 --> 16:09.795
And maybe that really is the function of a rare books library and special collections.

16:10.656 --> 16:14.620
It really isn't for the idle browser, you know?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.762
I think you're exactly right.

16:17.403 --> 16:22.548
I think you will see, in fact, a kind of oscillating access question there.

16:22.568 --> 16:32.318
After you've seen an image of portfolio 94, and then after you've looked at page 94, there are techniques and technologies now that people are working on

16:32.753 --> 16:38.599
which can take even the physical artifact and see it better than you can see it with your native eye.

16:40.061 --> 16:45.767
I've seen presentations where people look at ancient wood.

16:46.468 --> 16:50.172
They're thin slices of wood that people wrote letters on.

16:51.653 --> 17:01.444
And when they're preserved from the ancient world, it's often hard to tell the difference between where they've been written on and where there's just a smudge or a mark or a blur of some kind.

17:01.964 --> 17:10.139
And so what these guys now do is use the high-powered microscope photographer and play light over the surface.

17:10.159 --> 17:16.630
And as the light moves across the surface, if it was written, it's likely to have had some indentation in the surface.

17:16.650 --> 17:19.956
And that makes a shadow change as you play light across it.

17:19.976 --> 17:23.903
But if it's just a smudge on the surface, nothing changes if you play light across it.

17:23.923 --> 17:25.306
It doesn't move.

17:25.326 --> 17:26.588
And so having...

17:26.838 --> 17:34.888
looked at an ordinary photograph, then looked at the thing, they can then go back to this very rarefied form of computer image analysis.

17:34.908 --> 17:38.502
Did you see that piece in the New York Times last week with the Thomas Jefferson letter?

17:39.106 --> 17:41.690
where they actually sent the letter to the FBI.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.133
I didn't see that one, but okay.

17:44.354 --> 17:55.390
And they scanned it and they did some of the things you just described to actually find what he had written underneath a word, to reveal a word.

17:55.450 --> 17:59.496
And actually the context, the contextual change was pretty interesting.

17:59.516 --> 18:01.519
This is now seeing something that...

18:02.005 --> 18:07.594
You have seen something that was there, but it was impossible to see it if you just had the physical artifact.

18:07.614 --> 18:08.054
That's right.

18:08.475 --> 18:11.059
Well, I mean, all that is the interplay between the two, you know.

18:11.600 --> 18:22.056
And I think it's really just a case of if you've got multiple ways of getting at something and you really want to get at it, you're foolish not to use as many of them as you can.

18:22.340 --> 18:34.450
So the shape and the heft and the feel of the book is not something that... I find that argument getting less and less interesting myself, frankly, the more I get into it, the changing.

18:34.711 --> 18:37.313
This apparently is not something that overly concerns you.

18:38.574 --> 18:43.078
Look, I'm sitting in an office in which there is one working... No, two working computers.

18:43.098 --> 18:44.839
Let me look around.

18:44.859 --> 18:46.020
Two museum-piece computers.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.882
I still have my original K-Pro2 here.

18:49.163 --> 18:51.385
And at a rough count, I would say...

18:55.533 --> 18:57.858
500 books, 700 books.

18:59.361 --> 19:07.858
I'll start worrying about my being too hept on these computer gadgets when that numerical balance begins to shift.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.082
For the moment, it's not.

19:12.205 --> 19:19.796
Tell me, to go back to the original question, and I would be on the paradox now, but to use the cliché, do you wear two hats?

19:19.896 --> 19:26.126
Are they distinctive pieces of apparel, or are they more or less manifestations of one?

19:26.587 --> 19:28.650
Other people see two hats.

19:29.230 --> 19:29.851
I see one.

19:30.152 --> 19:31.153
I feel one.

19:31.794 --> 19:34.298
It's partly a question of...

19:35.797 --> 19:39.942
I guess I would say the personal style I've brought to what I do.

19:41.543 --> 19:51.414
I have never, in using computers, been too much involved in the highest and fanciest experimental applications.

19:51.815 --> 20:02.226
I have rather lagged by always about a tenth of a generation trying to use stuff when it becomes fairly widely available.

20:02.712 --> 20:04.996
when it becomes a working tool.

20:05.016 --> 20:07.780
That doesn't mean I don't think people should be experimenting.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.023
We need the people experimenting.

20:10.043 --> 20:24.346
But for my teaching, for example, I'd rather use stuff at a point when a wide range of my students can take advantage of it than when it's at the point where you have to have a special piece of hardware and a special technician standing by to make it work.

20:24.366 --> 20:31.116
That can be very exciting, and that's how we prove concepts and make stuff happen.

20:31.771 --> 20:35.517
I really wait until the stuff is instrumental and then use it.

20:36.058 --> 20:53.847
And for that reason, I find it easy to understand myself as a mild-mannered professor of classics from West Texas, just trying to do my job as well as I can and using a variety of available means in order to do that.

20:54.063 --> 20:59.811
and understand how it doesn't necessarily always seem that way to other people, but that's how it feels from inside my head.

21:00.572 --> 21:05.900
What are the responsibilities and duties of the Vice Provost for Information Systems and Computing?

21:06.481 --> 21:12.930
Well, in the jargon of the day, Chief Information Officer.

21:13.010 --> 21:18.518
The organization that I had run, the Campus Data Network, and our connection to the Internet,

21:18.920 --> 21:22.704
It runs all of the administrative systems that get us paid and so forth.

21:22.724 --> 21:26.948
And I think getting paid is one of the things that makes classical professors what they are.

21:26.969 --> 21:31.253
So I'm actually involved in doing that.

21:31.273 --> 21:42.565
And we're both involved in academic computing, but also in large universities like this, coordinating academic computing across the university and trying to get the maximum.

21:43.203 --> 21:44.725
bang for our buck, as it were.

21:44.745 --> 21:51.535
So I'm specifically involved in things like classroom technology, classroom technology upgrades, distance learning programs.

21:51.855 --> 21:53.097
We're talking to outside.

21:53.317 --> 21:54.138
Is Penn doing that?

21:54.879 --> 21:55.721
We're getting into that.

21:55.741 --> 22:01.689
I can give you the URL for the provost report from a couple of weeks ago.

22:01.729 --> 22:10.261
We've got a couple of outside partners who are providing some of the technology and will provide some content.

22:10.281 --> 22:13.125
We will be doing it with, in the at the outset,

22:13.426 --> 22:23.699
continuing professional education and professional master's degrees, lifelong learning for professionals of one kind or another.

22:23.719 --> 22:42.724
But we're also looking at, we're going to start in the fall, college courses for highly motivated secondary school students, both for the value that it gives them and also, frankly, as a marketing device for delivering to the University of Pennsylvania content

22:42.907 --> 22:46.943
around the country and eventually around the world and the way it makes it think about us.

22:47.935 --> 22:50.138
Are you involved at all in programs?

22:50.199 --> 22:56.068
I spent a couple days last year with Cornell for this chapter I'm working on.

22:56.108 --> 23:04.381
Of course, Cornell is really elaborately involved in the digitization of texts as a preservation.

23:06.224 --> 23:07.065
Yeah, exactly.

23:07.406 --> 23:11.272
I did several interviews with Ann and I have her books.

23:11.292 --> 23:12.554
Exactly.

23:12.955 --> 23:14.517
Are you involved in that at all?

23:14.716 --> 23:44.436
Thank you.

23:45.952 --> 24:04.365
My specific responsibility to answer that question in that regard is to make sure that the library and the other academic units can and do work well together with each other so that we get as much standardized approach so that our students in dormitories and their homes and so forth can get at the interest.

24:05.105 --> 24:19.515
Now, one thing that Anne's group does do, which is interesting, and I think she is aware of the possible controversy that it involves, and they've only done, when I was there, I think they're up to about 5,000 volumes.

24:19.916 --> 24:25.628
They've got six million books at Cornell, so we're tackling a very small sample here.

24:25.608 --> 24:36.004
But books that they select to make digital preservation copies of, you know, I mean, when I saw them, they looked like veal cutlets.

24:36.044 --> 24:44.136
I mean, they'd been guillotined and stripped, and they get to have a nice flat surface, and then once they scan them, then they go off to the dump, you know?

24:44.917 --> 24:52.088
Well, my first book was about Cassiodorus, and I'm looking across from it right now at the copy that, when it went out of print, I had to scan it.

24:52.608 --> 24:53.709
And it's the same thing.

24:54.069 --> 25:01.116
It's the corpse of the book now, the binding, the back binding has been ripped off, the pile of pages, and so forth.

25:01.136 --> 25:09.985
And I sniff slightly when I look at that, although I can look up two shelves and see a couple copies of the real thing, and dust jackets, I feel a little better.

25:11.086 --> 25:20.775
I think there's powerful imagery involved in the physical destruction of a book.

25:21.262 --> 25:26.168
Now, Professor, could you do me a favor and just talk a little bit closer, more into the... Oh, sure.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.773
Powerful imagery and the destruction of a book.

25:29.793 --> 25:36.761
I am... I like to say that I have, in my lifetime, only thrown away one book.

25:36.781 --> 25:39.705
It was actually Frank Herbert's Dune Messiah.

25:39.725 --> 25:42.669
Such a god-awful favorite book.

25:42.689 --> 25:48.957
I was so frustrated when I finished, I was walking down the hall in the apartment building, I just threw it down the trash chute in a bit.

25:48.977 --> 25:49.277
Um...

25:51.805 --> 26:06.266
That's slightly irrational in the sense that if there are, in fact, 2,000 copies of my first book in the world somewhere, destroying one of them in order to make an electronic copy that will be widely available to many more people is, on the face of it, a perfectly rational thing to do.

26:07.007 --> 26:17.121
But I recognize the sort of chill in the stomach that I feel when I look at that, and I keep it to show people, to make them think about those kinds of things.

26:17.540 --> 26:21.545
There's profound cultural worry about the destruction of artifacts.

26:21.605 --> 26:35.922
I said a few minutes ago that books are still, in many respects, a better preservation medium than any electronic form is because the book can survive even if nobody pays any attention to it.

26:35.942 --> 26:44.712
The manuscript of Cassiodorus that we use to look at those illustrations spent hundreds of years not being read, just sort of stashed away on the back shelves,

26:45.282 --> 26:51.568
But you can do that with a book, and if it's not printed on acid-based paper, it's still there for you to look at.

26:52.469 --> 26:55.411
And your interface technology is still as good as it ever was.

26:55.972 --> 27:06.241
500 or 1,000 or 2,000 years later, electronic data, if you let it go for 10 years, can be suddenly inaccessible in a variety of ways.

27:06.261 --> 27:10.045
I'm talking to Jeff Rothenberg next week on this precise subject.

27:10.065 --> 27:12.387
I mean, there are strategies, but...

27:12.940 --> 27:16.043
They're a strategy for preservation of a variety of kinds.

27:16.143 --> 27:26.354
The one I saw just the other day, I think it was in Wired magazine or something, was that if you want to preserve your digital images, we will put them on some nickel substance, just made out of nickel.

27:27.275 --> 27:33.402
But the only technology you'll need is a microscope, because what we're doing is printing them as images in incredibly tiny form.

27:33.682 --> 27:34.503
This is in Wired?

27:35.404 --> 27:36.025
I think it was in Wired.

27:36.045 --> 27:36.825
I can't remember, though.

27:36.845 --> 27:37.526
I just didn't know my stuff.

27:37.546 --> 27:39.268
But someplace.

27:39.518 --> 27:50.484
that preservation, taking the digital images and essentially printing them in really tiny forms on some physically durable material that even 5,000 years now you'll be able to look at.

27:50.885 --> 27:53.612
Preservation of electronic information requires

27:54.031 --> 28:00.086
social organization and collaboration of people in an ongoing way to make sure stuff is... Yeah, of course.

28:00.106 --> 28:08.105
But to go back to your nickel preservation medium there, then you're going to have to have a... You still have to have the machine and the software to read it 2,000 years from now.

28:08.166 --> 28:11.213
No, this one is actually printing it as images of only a microscope.

28:11.193 --> 28:12.074
Oh, I see.

28:12.155 --> 28:12.515
Okay.

28:13.136 --> 28:15.560
We're kind of going back to the earlier form then, aren't we?

28:15.781 --> 28:17.523
Visual representation would suffice.

28:17.704 --> 28:19.547
But just microscopically reduced.

28:19.567 --> 28:24.415
I think we're assuming that most future cultures will have microscopy as good as we do.

28:24.435 --> 28:28.381
We could be wrong, but we're assuming that.

28:28.401 --> 28:35.753
But it does require social organization and collaboration about what it is we're going to preserve and how we're going to do it.

28:35.773 --> 28:36.795
And I can think easily...

28:37.113 --> 28:43.119
of strategies whereby we'll be able to carry material forward from one generation to the next.

28:43.759 --> 28:47.903
And we'll even carry lots of material forward that we're not conscious of.

28:48.383 --> 29:05.179
But still, you won't find... If the floppy disk with my 1983 scholarly article falls down in a crack between a floor and a house someplace and is discovered 200 years from now, nobody's going to be able to read it.

29:05.682 --> 29:15.157
If my doctoral dissertation winds up buried in a pile of rubble someplace on paper, 200 years from now, somebody could read it.

29:15.177 --> 29:16.502
And that is a real difference, no problem.

29:17.208 --> 29:20.932
And these are not just hypotheticals.

29:21.713 --> 29:30.823
There's a case, which I was just reading in the New York Times, these papers that survived the Warsaw Ghetto, these doctors that did these, they literally hid them in the ground.

29:31.644 --> 29:38.971
The other side of it is, my doctoral dissertation, I have to admit, didn't have exactly tens of thousands of readers.

29:40.273 --> 29:44.177
And most of them were located within a few miles of where the thing was written.

29:44.849 --> 29:49.874
By making it available electronically, there's loss of gain, cost of benefit.

29:49.934 --> 30:02.927
You run some risk of preservation, but you also get the advantage of being able to reach many more people during what's sort of the natural lifetime of the artifact than you would have otherwise.

30:04.048 --> 30:12.156
I like to point out that human beings, when they get new technology, generally accept the technology that gives them more power.

30:13.115 --> 30:16.921
even when there are substantial costs that are associated with that.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.303
And my example is the automobile.

30:19.545 --> 30:34.208
When I get in my car and drive 55 miles an hour, I am implicitly accepting the fact that about 40,000 dead people a year is a reasonable price to pay for me driving 55 miles an hour.

30:34.949 --> 30:37.694
I do not like that part of my personality very much.

30:37.854 --> 30:39.797
I don't like to think about that part of my personality.

30:40.199 --> 30:45.485
But you and I and all the rest of us have made, we could just say, okay, 20 miles an hour, that's it.

30:45.505 --> 30:48.308
Nobody's going to make a vehicle that can go faster than cops will enforce it.

30:48.949 --> 30:52.032
And we could save, I'm sure, tens of thousands of lives.

30:52.472 --> 30:59.100
And even 20 miles an hour would have been a vast improvement over walking speed, you know, from pre-automotive technology.

31:00.301 --> 31:03.945
But we've made a choice to do 55 miles an hour and...

31:04.381 --> 31:08.790
If I'm not under rope here, I might even allow as to how occasionally I do a little more than 55.

31:08.810 --> 31:10.934
Well, we have 65 in Massachusetts.

31:11.555 --> 31:12.157
Well, there you go.

31:12.177 --> 31:15.102
I might even have done more than 65 at some point in my life.

31:15.122 --> 31:15.964
I think so.

31:16.104 --> 31:18.169
I mean, I'm not swearing to this or anything.

31:18.569 --> 31:18.930
But...

31:19.163 --> 31:23.830
In so doing, we accept a cost that goes with that.

31:24.130 --> 31:27.556
Well, it matters to me that I can get to New York City for my house in three hours.

31:28.036 --> 31:30.119
Right, and New York City has a powerful value.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.241
That's right.

31:31.261 --> 31:34.045
Where do you live in Massachusetts?

31:34.165 --> 31:35.307
Central Mass, near Worcester.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.649
Okay.

31:37.070 --> 31:40.575
People who lived there 100 years ago didn't see New York very often.

31:40.595 --> 31:41.256
That's right.

31:41.236 --> 31:51.034
And not only were they poorer, but in a way New York was poorer because part of what makes New York now is the flood of people from all over who are passing through at any given moment.

31:51.155 --> 31:51.816
That's right.

31:51.836 --> 31:53.238
And the diversity of the community.

31:53.258 --> 31:55.042
So that's an incredible benefit that we get.

31:55.382 --> 31:57.847
And there's this incredible cost that we pay on the other side.

31:58.629 --> 32:03.177
And we've more or less worked out in some kind of weird free market economics

32:03.157 --> 32:10.368
our level of acceptable casualties in order to get this other cultural good.

32:10.909 --> 32:26.994
We're not going to behave, I believe, human beings just aren't going to behave any differently when it comes to information technology than they do when it comes to automotive technology or medical technology or any such thing.

32:27.054 --> 32:28.877
There's a book by a guy named Ed

32:29.093 --> 32:30.235
Kenner, do you know that?

32:30.435 --> 32:30.635
No.

32:31.536 --> 32:32.638
Ed?

32:33.279 --> 32:35.262
I can get the title for you on screen here in a second.

32:36.003 --> 32:38.967
The title is something like, Why Things Bite Back.

32:38.987 --> 32:39.968
Oh, I know the book, yep.

32:40.349 --> 32:44.194
Okay, which is The Unintended Consequences of Technology.

32:44.815 --> 32:46.477
I have a copy here someplace.

32:46.778 --> 32:55.590
The drug-resistant, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and that sort of thing.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.684
Edward Tenor, Why Things Bite Back.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.027
Yeah.

33:00.047 --> 33:01.510
Yeah, I have it here, actually.

33:01.530 --> 33:01.951
Someplace.

33:01.971 --> 33:02.672
I have to find it.

33:02.732 --> 33:03.213
A lot of books.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.760
Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Conflicts.

33:06.881 --> 33:07.201
Yeah, great.

33:07.221 --> 33:10.107
Well, I think it's a wise observation.

33:10.127 --> 33:11.630
There's a lot of clever stuff in that book.

33:11.730 --> 33:14.997
And I think it is a feature of how...

33:16.428 --> 33:18.490
how human beings interact with the world.

33:18.831 --> 33:26.699
I saw a wonderful... I was looking for something in Scientific American, the 1895 run there, and I was looking for this article.

33:26.739 --> 33:27.720
I still haven't found it.

33:28.721 --> 33:39.773
Well, they were talking about, even then, how the Brittle Book phenomenon, they didn't call it that, but papers were disintegrating, and so they warned against it.

33:39.893 --> 33:43.036
This is like in 1895, and I saw a reference to it, and I wanted to find it.

33:43.056 --> 33:45.439
I still haven't found it, but while I was looking...

33:45.419 --> 33:55.993
In the microfilm, I run across a wonderful series of illustrations of this German inventor who has come up with headlights for horses, battery-powered.

33:56.294 --> 34:02.842
And there are these illustrations of these horses, you know, with, like, headlights on their head and one on the harness.

34:03.223 --> 34:07.989
And I said, boy, these people just didn't get where the technology was going.

34:08.009 --> 34:11.454
Well, somebody was putting some technology work into those headlights.

34:11.474 --> 34:13.857
It did pay off in the first headlights on...

34:13.837 --> 34:14.558
On cars.

34:14.578 --> 34:15.358
Yeah, probably.

34:15.438 --> 34:26.929
They were miniaturizing and downsizing and making the power lighter and probably paid off, but just not in the way that they... But it's like really not seeing where the technology is actually going.

34:26.949 --> 34:30.773
Well, I mean, look, when they talked about the first cars as horseless carriages.

34:31.393 --> 34:31.773
That's right.

34:31.813 --> 34:33.515
That was a way to help you think about what it did.

34:33.915 --> 34:36.638
And it probably made the farmer think he was going to get to town quicker.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.280
Well, we still have horsepower in our cars, don't we?

34:39.861 --> 34:42.223
But, I mean, he thought of it as getting him to town quicker.

34:42.642 --> 34:59.470
The farmer who lived 20-some miles from downtown Philadelphia in a place called King of Prussia, a pokey little village by the side of the road, did not imagine Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and the largest shopping mall on the East Coast, unless somebody's built a bigger one recently.

34:59.939 --> 35:19.635
uh sprouting up in his cornfield but that was a logical consequence of having that first horseless carriage come by if you'd asked that farmer do you think it would be a good idea to pave this all over and put up a walmart he might have had some ambiguous ideas about it but in the short term he was happy having some gadgets that would get into the

35:20.611 --> 35:23.538
get him to the village faster, and it would help him tow his stuff around.

35:23.558 --> 35:25.843
I've got to tell you a cute story regarding your book here.

35:26.164 --> 35:33.040
In your Chapter 2, you start with this quote, California has stopped construction plans for university libraries, etc.

35:33.782 --> 35:36.167
And then you cite Washington Post, 21 November 1993.

35:36.288 --> 35:38.974
And I said, I've been...

35:38.954 --> 35:44.824
trying to document the state of California actually having said that for reasons of this chapter.

35:46.107 --> 35:48.992
And so I said, oh, so this is Washington Post.

35:49.012 --> 35:54.601
So I've got a Lexnex, not the big, big one, but one for home use.

35:54.621 --> 35:55.323
And it's really pretty.

35:55.343 --> 35:57.807
I don't get the legal stuff, but I get everything else.

35:58.411 --> 36:01.975
So I did a search of Washington Post, and it didn't pop up right away.

36:02.015 --> 36:02.876
But then you have a feature.

36:03.237 --> 36:08.744
If you want major stories or any mentions, so I put in Virtual Library, and it comes out.

36:08.784 --> 36:11.287
It's a Michael Durda column.

36:12.268 --> 36:12.809
You have it right.

36:12.889 --> 36:13.850
There's no mistake here.

36:16.072 --> 36:22.040
The irony here is I was going to call Michael Durda, who I know, and say, Michael, the only thing about this piece, well, he's the one who wrote it.

36:22.080 --> 36:28.047
But his reference for that, his citation for that, was something called the Abbey Newsletter.

36:28.027 --> 36:42.044
which I'd never heard of before, and now I find out that the Abbey newsletter is put out by this woman, formerly in Maryland, but now in Austin, Texas, and she apparently is the guru of preservation techniques, of paper-based things.

36:42.925 --> 36:54.500
I mean, I haven't called it just yet, but I mean, I wouldn't have found this at all without technology, or I would have had to spend, we don't have any Washington Post here, microfilm, I'd have to go to Boston.

36:55.361 --> 36:57.223
Well, let me tell you what's funny about that.

36:57.895 --> 37:01.741
One reason why you found that is because I found that in LexisNexis.

37:01.982 --> 37:02.483
Is that right?

37:03.064 --> 37:06.489
And my other quotations there about virtual library are from LexisNexis.

37:07.010 --> 37:18.790
And as I recall at that point, I was bashful about saying that I'd gotten it from LexisNexis because our contract with them for the university says we may use it only for purposes of teaching.

37:19.276 --> 37:19.696
Really?

37:19.757 --> 37:25.983
The librarians were on our case not to talk up too much that occasionally the use we made for teaching would slop over.

37:26.023 --> 37:31.830
So I just didn't mention it, but you're getting back to, by your path, exactly the same thing.

37:31.850 --> 37:39.138
Yeah, well, I have a personal contract with them, and I intend to mention LexisNexis as a research tool in this book.

37:39.158 --> 37:40.479
They broadened our contract.

37:40.519 --> 37:44.524
They were very fussy when we first got the relationship with them.

37:44.584 --> 37:45.865
They've actually broadened it a bit.

37:45.885 --> 37:46.566
I haven't gotten more sense.

37:48.301 --> 38:04.588
There is a new university out in Monterey Bay on the site of Fort Ord, and when that was being established in 1993, they said, but they deny it now, that this university will be built without a library.

38:05.277 --> 38:14.173
And, of course, the public relations flack that came out of that was, so they did put in a library, and now they're into their fifth year.

38:14.714 --> 38:15.816
But I did a check the other day.

38:15.836 --> 38:18.161
How many volumes, how many books would you think they have?

38:18.241 --> 38:21.126
Now, this is a library that has over 2,000 students.

38:21.106 --> 38:25.471
How many books would you... Well, actually, I know, I've met Peter Smith, the guy who runs that place.

38:25.511 --> 38:26.953
I have some idea of the place.

38:27.433 --> 38:31.598
I think they're probably making do with, I've put it on the order, between 10 and 100,000.

38:31.618 --> 38:31.958
34,000.

38:32.679 --> 38:32.779
Okay.

38:32.879 --> 38:33.500
Yeah.

38:35.162 --> 38:41.549
Well, now, I tell you, you get a lot of... This goes back to early days of the conversation about this.

38:41.569 --> 38:45.233
People say, oh, gosh, what will happen when we put the whole Library of Congress online?

38:45.273 --> 38:46.515
How long would it take to do that?

38:46.575 --> 38:48.657
How long would it take... It'll never happen.

38:48.677 --> 38:49.358
Won't happen.

38:49.675 --> 38:53.605
My argument back was in those days I used to live up the block from Bryn Mawr College here.

38:55.009 --> 39:02.368
Bryn Mawr College is a very respectable academic institution with a wonderful library which doesn't run to more than half a million volumes.

39:03.057 --> 39:03.838
That's all they have?

39:03.998 --> 39:06.982
And in fact, yeah, it's a small college of, you know, 1,500 students.

39:07.002 --> 39:10.227
Yeah, but I would have put that in the Williams Amherst million copy category.

39:11.789 --> 39:12.210
Interesting.

39:12.390 --> 39:13.892
No, they probably don't, but I just would have.

39:13.992 --> 39:15.013
We're looking at a reference book.

39:15.033 --> 39:18.098
I don't think they... No, no, I can check that out.

39:18.218 --> 39:32.237
My number was... But my point was that even at half a million volumes, if you count that, which is no more than 5% of what the Library of Congress has, you've already got a huge cut of...

39:32.943 --> 39:38.107
the books that, what, 99% of the population would find useful on any given day.

39:39.088 --> 39:41.951
You've already got 25 copies of Moby Dick.

39:42.952 --> 39:48.436
If it's electronic editions, you really can narrow it down to what are the different editions of Moby Dick that make a difference.

39:48.456 --> 39:51.018
Is there, you know, the first printing and the third printing or something?

39:52.700 --> 40:02.308
And I think, I don't think we have a good number for what sized collection of electronically available books

40:02.795 --> 40:11.368
for how big that collection would have to be before, well, I'm sorry, there's several variables running here simultaneously.

40:12.090 --> 40:24.028
How big a collection of books do you have to have scanned in electronic form before 90% of the academic population says, yeah, that's a really good library.

40:24.188 --> 40:30.979
I can use that as my basic library, and I don't need a physical building except for

40:31.955 --> 40:41.543
things I need to see face to face and research materials, rare materials, unusual things that I'm probably the only person hearing.

40:41.877 --> 40:47.884
But, you know, I also address myself in this book I'm writing as to the numbers game.

40:48.545 --> 40:51.568
You know, I mean, there is a lot of trash out there.

40:51.588 --> 40:59.477
When libraries were building, in fact, if you go to ARL statistics today, you know, they still classify you by the number that you have.

40:59.797 --> 41:03.201
And more is more reputable.

41:03.582 --> 41:10.770
And I can introduce you to the cataloger in our library here who shudders every time the Indian government does another census.

41:10.750 --> 41:21.089
Oh, I think so, sure.

41:21.369 --> 41:33.231
You know, I mean, you'll never see another printed edition of the OED, and that's good.

41:33.211 --> 41:36.135
Or the Encyclopedia Britannica.

41:36.155 --> 41:38.219
You know, I mean, this thing is changing on a daily basis.

41:39.741 --> 41:45.069
But, you know, what happened when they were building these libraries is that they acquired a lot of bulk.

41:45.089 --> 41:47.813
I mean, just stuff, just for numbers.

41:47.893 --> 41:53.141
I've documented the York University up in Toronto, for instance, in 1967.

41:53.241 --> 41:54.443
That's when they opened.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.243
They've got two million books today.

41:56.884 --> 42:02.233
I mean, the first thing they did was send three trailer trucks down to Boston and clean out a second-hand bookstore.

42:02.693 --> 42:07.041
And they sent another one to Montreal to do a similar thing with French titles.

42:07.061 --> 42:08.443
I'll give you a tip on another one.

42:09.144 --> 42:11.368
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

42:11.388 --> 42:12.009
Oh, I like that.

42:12.170 --> 42:13.532
And I'll tell you why.

42:13.552 --> 42:14.053
I've been there.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.817
They were founded about ten years ago.

42:16.978 --> 42:17.739
Hong Kong.

42:17.759 --> 42:20.143
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

42:20.461 --> 42:23.126
I bet I can find something Lexnex on it, too, right?

42:23.146 --> 42:23.266
Sure.

42:23.747 --> 42:25.871
University of Science and Technology.

42:25.891 --> 42:26.893
Gorgeous location.

42:26.913 --> 42:28.196
Spectacular location.

42:28.296 --> 42:29.599
I was out there and came to talk.

42:29.619 --> 42:30.280
Just gorgeous.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.406
But anyway, they founded a library about 10 years ago.

42:33.706 --> 42:41.862
They recruited, she was deputy librarian, I think, at Caltech, who's now their head librarian, a Chinese-American, Chinese-born, American-trained...

42:42.331 --> 42:44.674
took advantage to go back to China and run a library.

42:45.174 --> 42:45.855
And she's brilliant.

42:45.875 --> 42:46.496
She's well-known.

42:46.516 --> 42:47.757
Do you know her name off the top?

42:48.498 --> 42:49.499
Min Min Chang.

42:49.679 --> 42:50.400
Oh, good for you.

42:50.660 --> 42:52.642
Okay.

42:52.823 --> 42:52.923
Okay.

42:53.643 --> 42:58.969
Anyway, they, in the Hong Kong of the late 80s and 90s, were just plain rich.

42:59.270 --> 43:02.113
Their acquisition strategy was buy every book you can.

43:02.994 --> 43:06.558
And when you go into there, I think I might even mention it in the book somewhere.

43:06.578 --> 43:07.138
Maybe I do.

43:07.419 --> 43:10.482
You go in there and they've bought all brand new copies of books.

43:11.221 --> 43:17.618
If the book is in print, they're buying it from any reputable publisher that might have scholarly and scientific material.

43:17.979 --> 43:24.977
Hong Kong U of Science and Technology, my three-volume edition and commentary on the Latin text only of Augustine's Confessions is sitting there.

43:25.700 --> 43:27.322
I don't think it's ever going to be read there.

43:27.943 --> 43:30.206
But anyway, they're... Well, it's okay.

43:30.266 --> 43:31.227
It's there.

43:31.748 --> 43:32.149
It matters.

43:32.249 --> 43:38.297
My point is that it might be interesting to find out what number they've gotten to in 10 years.

43:38.357 --> 43:39.619
And if it's still the policy.

43:39.699 --> 43:42.743
And if it's still the policy with the change in Hong Kong government now.

43:43.704 --> 43:46.408
Well, not just Hong Kong government, but with technology now.

43:46.912 --> 43:54.689
Um, let's see, I was there in summer of 95, spring of 95, and they were buying grapes, that much I know.

43:55.290 --> 43:55.771
They were still?

43:57.294 --> 43:57.374
Yep.

43:57.395 --> 43:57.475
Yep.

43:57.495 --> 44:00.040
Boy, you wouldn't have this gal's phone number, would you?

44:03.227 --> 44:03.688
Um...

44:04.462 --> 44:06.666
If you can find it.

44:06.826 --> 44:08.189
Yeah, this would be great.

44:08.249 --> 44:08.790
This would be good.

44:10.573 --> 44:12.677
Just to switch briefly here for a second.

44:13.238 --> 44:15.663
By the way, has the Philadelphia Inquirer done anything on you?

44:16.484 --> 44:17.086
Inquirer?

44:17.567 --> 44:18.568
I don't think so, no.

44:19.129 --> 44:22.656
I do occasional things for them.

44:22.636 --> 44:26.623
Generally, it requires a face-to-face, but I'm going to give the editor over there a call.

44:26.643 --> 44:28.085
I think it would be a good story for them.

44:29.468 --> 44:29.968
But we'll see.

44:32.453 --> 44:33.254
Okay.

44:33.615 --> 44:38.603
Plus, I have a group of newspapers I write for.

44:38.819 --> 44:42.463
So there were a lot of things we could do here.

44:42.523 --> 44:43.664
Let's jump if we can.

44:43.804 --> 44:45.666
I've got to leave for Boston.

44:45.686 --> 44:46.667
I'm having lunch today.

44:46.807 --> 44:47.989
You'll find this interesting.

44:49.010 --> 44:58.380
With probably the most notable architect of academic libraries in the world, a guy in Boston who's doing stuff for Harvard.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.201
He did the Getty.

44:59.261 --> 45:00.682
He's doing Butler Live.

45:00.942 --> 45:02.464
I really want to find out.

45:02.444 --> 45:07.169
the thought that goes into the design of a library today for the 21st century.

45:08.891 --> 45:13.596
What do you feel about the library as the soul of a university?

45:13.656 --> 45:21.865
Obviously, this whole concept is... Well, interesting how you put it that way.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.327
Soul is a... Well, the heart.

45:23.807 --> 45:25.049
Some people call it the heart.

45:25.950 --> 45:28.733
The faculty is the brain and the library is the heart.

45:28.813 --> 45:31.776
Those are metaphors from organic life.

45:32.903 --> 45:39.152
If a library is just a warehouse of dead tree material, there is no life in it at all.

45:39.273 --> 45:40.835
Well, let me just interrupt.

45:40.895 --> 45:42.698
The soul is not organic, though, is it?

45:43.659 --> 45:44.400
It's not organic.

45:44.781 --> 45:45.742
It's animate, so yes.

45:46.584 --> 45:49.528
But it's animate rather than inanimate.

45:51.170 --> 45:58.361
And as I say, if all it is is a warehouse in which you put a lot of dead tree material with black marks on it, it's not.

45:58.762 --> 45:59.583
Well, then it's a warehouse.

45:59.743 --> 46:00.885
It's a warehouse.

46:00.983 --> 46:10.093
And no library attracts our loyalty because of the dead material that's in it.

46:10.254 --> 46:20.585
It attracts our loyalty because of the living intellectual conversations that we have with both the dead and with our living colleagues and friends around the world.

46:24.029 --> 46:30.957
Libraries already, when I was an undergraduate at Princeton 30 years ago, they already had one of the first to be off-campus storage facilities.

46:31.409 --> 46:33.494
for little-used books.

46:33.514 --> 46:34.997
There's a lot of movement in that direction.

46:35.017 --> 46:36.681
At Harvard, I don't know if you know the Harvard Depository.

46:36.701 --> 46:38.805
I start a chapter at the Harvard Depository.

46:39.086 --> 46:44.238
I mean, that's a hugely successful... Well, that's going to house 20 million volumes.

46:44.458 --> 46:44.558
Yeah.

46:45.039 --> 46:48.928
And that puts a whole lot of the warehousing outside of Widener.

46:49.432 --> 46:55.180
And yet, from what I hear, the Harvard folks, Harvard faculty, pretty stuffy guys, are pretty happy with the service that they get.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.764
Well, because they were involved in the planning and the choice.

46:57.784 --> 47:04.353
And to determine which books, and I go into this, how the books are selected to go there.

47:04.514 --> 47:05.815
Exactly.

47:06.216 --> 47:06.917
They're doing it now.
