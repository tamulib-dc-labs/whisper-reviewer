WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:03.194
pretty well.

00:03.214 --> 00:08.000
You know, the usual suspects are seeming cheerful.

00:08.020 --> 00:08.821
Okay, Nicholson Baker.

00:09.001 --> 00:11.204
This is on, okay.

00:11.965 --> 00:22.258
Yeah, so I mean, I've got someone in charge there, you know, as well as I do, who seems to be a lot closer to what

00:23.251 --> 00:26.735
what the public would want from somebody learning a great library.

00:26.755 --> 00:30.118
It's a very interesting thing to me, though, and it still sticks.

00:30.138 --> 00:32.941
I mean, it's the one quote out of all the people I've talked to.

00:34.202 --> 00:39.948
I said, do you see the role of the San Francisco Public Library as being a research library?

00:39.988 --> 00:40.589
And he said, no.

00:42.571 --> 00:46.514
That's quite a shocking, not shocking, but it is quite a disclosure for me.

00:46.555 --> 00:50.018
I mean, the Boston Public Library is one of the great research libraries.

00:50.504 --> 00:52.327
New York, Cleveland.

00:52.507 --> 00:59.157
Why not San Francisco, especially when there are no other major public, publicly available facilities?

00:59.217 --> 01:00.459
Am I talking a little bit about this?

01:00.559 --> 01:01.340
No, no, not at all.

01:01.400 --> 01:15.702
I remember you saying that, and I was honestly a little puzzled by that, because whether

01:16.002 --> 01:20.847
any administrator likes it or not, the San Francisco Public Library already is a research library.

01:20.868 --> 01:21.268
That's right.

01:21.388 --> 01:30.939
I mean, even if they didn't buy a single book, even if they stopped subscribing to all of their 7,000 plus periodicals, they would always be a research library.

01:31.079 --> 01:43.393
In fact, as the years went on, if they properly cared for their collection, they would become more and more of a research library, because that's the inheritance of the library grows in value as the

01:44.116 --> 01:45.879
if the collection is taken care of.

01:45.899 --> 02:07.291
The only thing I can say is that she maybe wants to avoid the kind of managerial problems that are associated with defining something as a research library, because in that definition, there are these quantitative measures.

02:07.311 --> 02:13.380
You have to have a certain number of books, a certain number of periodical subscriptions, and she wants the flexibility to concentrate.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.733
And there's also a definition of research depth to me.

02:17.193 --> 02:20.196
Right.

02:20.216 --> 02:20.877
That's right.

02:20.897 --> 02:22.879
Had I already interviewed her when I came to see you?

02:22.919 --> 02:24.560
I guess I hadn't seen Dowling.

02:24.620 --> 02:29.025
No, I think we talked on the phone after the thing, and you mentioned that.

02:29.085 --> 02:42.017
I hope it's just a matter of semantics or something and not the fact that her own background, which is of a small

02:44.242 --> 02:50.531
the city library that, while it's a very fine little library, is not a research lecture, the Berkeley Public Library.

02:50.551 --> 02:54.157
I hope that her background isn't kind of asserting itself.

02:54.177 --> 02:58.443
Well, she was interviewed on a Sunday morning a couple of weeks ago, did you see that?

02:59.365 --> 03:04.292
And they were doing a nice, bright, feel-good feature.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.494
on the tool library in Berkeley.

03:07.514 --> 03:10.478
There's a tool that they call a tool, are you aware of this?

03:10.498 --> 03:12.340
Oh yeah, well I've seen other tool libraries.

03:12.500 --> 03:18.609
And the people, the guys who teach you how to work, how to use a saw, they're librarians.

03:18.629 --> 03:20.531
Right.

03:20.551 --> 03:29.824
You know, that's cute, but should library money be spent, I mean I think to me it's diverting money that should be spent for books

03:30.125 --> 03:31.607
What do you mean, coming out of the library, by the way?

03:31.627 --> 03:32.428
It's the library.

03:32.488 --> 03:35.031
It's the Berkeley Public Library that runs this.

03:35.111 --> 03:39.857
And Gina was interviewed because she was the one who was there when it was put in place.

03:40.577 --> 03:52.211
And you know, I went to a thing here at the BPL a couple of weeks ago, which is back that way, observing its 150th anniversary this year, the oldest public library.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.474
And John Berry, the head of Library Journal, was there.

03:54.494 --> 03:57.938
I chatted with him, and I'll be interviewing him later for this book.

03:59.116 --> 04:14.542
You know, when you think about it, I think more than seventy percent of American people may assert that they use a public library in the course of a year, and yet it gets less than one percent of a municipal budget.

04:15.483 --> 04:20.652
What other municipal agencies deliver so much?

04:21.037 --> 04:24.861
to the missionary for such a minuscule portion.

04:24.881 --> 04:30.426
And then you're going to still use that minuscule little portion to go out and buy tools.

04:30.466 --> 04:31.127
Tools and drills.

04:32.148 --> 04:32.288
Yeah.

04:32.368 --> 04:34.330
Well, yeah, no, that does seem strange.

04:34.850 --> 04:35.190
I wonder.

04:35.250 --> 04:35.831
And I've asked.

04:35.891 --> 04:37.072
I can't say that that's the case.

04:37.092 --> 04:38.313
I've asked a few questions.

04:38.333 --> 04:42.057
I'm not going to make a big deal out of it, but it just seems to me that, yeah, fine, do a thing with the tools.

04:42.577 --> 04:43.098
That's great.

04:43.638 --> 04:50.605
But does that then meanwhile, at the same time, at Berkeley have this thing going on over at the university with the

04:51.007 --> 04:55.113
the resources there being dramatically reduced, and that's all.

04:55.153 --> 05:05.787
Oh, yeah, that's gotten worse since, I mean, did you finally get the report that came out from, what's that name, that guy's name, anyway?

05:05.807 --> 05:07.349
Peter Lyman.

05:07.369 --> 05:13.818
No, he resigned, but the guy who was head of the Alumni Journal published it.

05:13.838 --> 05:14.319
Oh, I got that.

05:14.339 --> 05:15.601
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got that.

05:15.621 --> 05:18.685
I mean, there are definitely people fighting that.

05:19.627 --> 05:25.713
very hard, but Rosenblatt, Sue Rosenblatt, is entrenched.

05:26.113 --> 05:32.159
Peter Lyman was the titular head, but Sue Rosenblatt is the one that the... Who is she?

05:32.719 --> 05:47.473
She's some kind of acting library director, assistant director, you know, the kind of person who is going to be there, and she is in... And like Gina Hover, she's not really appointed as the...

05:48.010 --> 05:52.656
Oh, that might be the... Yeah.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.981
Well, we will get to the new book presently.

05:57.001 --> 05:59.704
And that will, by the way, be the lead.

05:59.724 --> 06:02.668
I'm going to just keep this here so I can see the number, so I can cue.

06:03.248 --> 06:04.029
You want to put it over here?

06:04.690 --> 06:06.172
Yeah, just so I can see the number.

06:06.252 --> 06:08.315
I've got some space here.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.017
This is good.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.239
Just so if there's a number, I want to cue.

06:12.279 --> 06:14.482
That also helps when you're transcribing, by the way.

06:14.522 --> 06:15.603
It goes straight to the number.

06:15.623 --> 06:16.544
Oh, yeah.

06:16.564 --> 06:17.005
Yeah, yeah.

06:18.520 --> 06:23.246
But I just wanted to say this, no thanks, maybe a little bit later.

06:23.346 --> 06:37.164
I just wanted to say that about, you know, I don't, I've never talked to Gina Manufri, so I don't know if she's, if she's, if she's, but she's clearly a lot closer.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.106
I mean, she's within the ballpark.

06:39.147 --> 06:46.536
All administrators are going to have blind spots, and they're not going to understand things the way the real, you know,

06:47.782 --> 06:55.332
The true lover of a certain profession wants them to understand things, but she's obviously closer.

06:56.353 --> 07:13.536
Sue Rosenblatt, on the other hand, from what I understand, and I don't want to get too personal, is a person who is closer to the Dowland staff.

07:13.752 --> 07:26.527
a person who deals entirely in questions of funding and cutting and, you know, how can we reduce staff and how can we get as many books off the shelves and into remote storage?

07:26.567 --> 07:28.550
You know, how do we cut down circulation?

07:28.570 --> 07:35.558
I mean, the real incentive to get books off the shelves, that seems to me interesting.

07:35.618 --> 07:41.565
I mean, you build a new building and then, in the case of Berkeley, you get the shelves

07:41.950 --> 07:50.840
half-empty in many cases, because it's in the library's interest, if they're looking at it this way, to have as many books unbrowsable as possible.

07:51.541 --> 07:55.846
You know, if they're remotely stored, then they're not going to circulate as much.

07:56.446 --> 07:59.149
It's a labor-intensive business.

07:59.169 --> 08:00.311
They're not going to be discovered, either.

08:00.491 --> 08:05.997
They're not going to be found, and they're not going to be taken out, and that means they don't have to be reshelled.

08:06.538 --> 08:07.439
There's no wear and tear.

08:07.839 --> 08:11.383
They just sit there, and the fact that they don't circulate

08:11.937 --> 08:17.023
becomes just a self-fulfilling process.

08:17.043 --> 08:25.354
I'll start a chapter in the new book, and this is written already with Ken Carpenter over at Harvard, and he's a wonderful librarian.

08:27.036 --> 08:34.786
I spent a morning with him going through Widener with a trolley, going through the process of picking books for remote storage.

08:35.787 --> 08:38.250
What criteria are we using?

08:38.270 --> 08:41.134
How are you deciding?

08:41.283 --> 08:45.472
I mean, I was even responsible for picking a couple of books.

08:45.492 --> 08:54.350
He said, you know, we discussed how we do it, and a little duplicates of, you know, 1920s fiction that nobody reads, what do you need four copies of this book for here?

08:56.334 --> 09:02.667
But he said, you know, it dawned on him at one point that I am really influencing

09:03.102 --> 09:04.423
scholarly inquiry.

09:05.064 --> 09:07.847
And he takes this so seriously.

09:08.407 --> 09:12.231
And he said, and I also realized that in some cases I was reinforcing the canon.

09:12.271 --> 09:16.915
Now, he said, I believe in the canon, but do we need to have 40 volumes of Shakespeare here?

09:18.217 --> 09:26.064
He was going to encyclopedias and references to make sure that the standards were there.

09:26.665 --> 09:32.130
He said, but in some instances he was sending off books that nobody was calling for at all.

09:32.448 --> 09:36.917
At the same time, he had a daughter who was doing research and a Ph.D.

09:36.937 --> 09:41.105
at Harvard on 18th century female French writers.

09:41.726 --> 09:50.643
He said, if I had sent those books off, she would never have, because every serendipity, the serendipity of browsing, that's what you're talking about right here.

09:50.703 --> 09:51.705
Right.

09:52.124 --> 09:56.830
the elimination of the card catalog takes away, the elimination of the stacks to go in.

09:56.910 --> 10:04.601
I mean, I always find more exciting things next to the book I'm looking for that are much more useful to me than the book I go in to find.

10:04.721 --> 10:06.343
I'm sure you've discovered that.

10:06.363 --> 10:14.234
And so he wants to retain that kind of a... Within the limits of the fact that you can't put everything on the shelf.

10:14.254 --> 10:16.877
That you can't keep all 20 million books that I would owe.

10:16.897 --> 10:18.840
It's not 40 million, but that's what the facility is.

10:19.057 --> 10:21.641
So we did that for a morning, and that was kind of fun.

10:21.741 --> 10:30.713
And then I went out to the center, which is out in Southville, which is right next to where they keep the chimpanzees for the monkeys for the medical school.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.317
That was kind of funny.

10:33.337 --> 10:34.478
You know, like, you've got this site.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.382
But they're going to have 20 million books.

10:37.402 --> 10:38.564
At least they're keeping the books.

10:38.764 --> 10:38.985
Right.

10:39.285 --> 10:39.906
That's the thing.

10:40.627 --> 10:41.027
Yeah.

10:41.047 --> 10:42.990
And it's a 24-hour turnaround, by the way.

10:43.030 --> 10:46.195
I requested a book, and it was there the next morning.

10:46.335 --> 10:48.658
And then Berkeley has a very good system like that, too.

10:49.027 --> 11:03.125
in that they seem to be very careful about not withdrawing to gifts anything that's not absolutely, that's a duplicate.

11:03.145 --> 11:11.475
I mean, they have all these tags sticking up out of all the books, but I checked them, and the books seem, in large part, to be duplicates.

11:12.276 --> 11:14.038
But they are dismantling Moffat.

11:14.058 --> 11:18.544
But all the libraries are... Remote storage is the way to go.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.551
collections have always grown.

11:20.712 --> 11:22.613
They're going to continue to grow.

11:23.314 --> 11:39.529
And what seems to have happened is that the computer industry sold library managers on the idea that libraries wouldn't have to grow physically.

11:39.669 --> 11:46.776
I think library managers would never say that.

11:48.207 --> 12:13.135
In the back of their mind was this hope that the idea of a permanently increasing physical collection was a hope that that permanent increasing collection was going to stop increasing, that they would get control over it somehow.

12:13.992 --> 12:16.975
Well, I didn't say it right.

12:17.135 --> 12:43.982
I mean, I think in the back of library managers' minds that the software industry was able to convince library managers somehow that they would be able to stop this age-old

12:44.435 --> 12:52.986
process of a gradually age-old, you know, when I try to provide a quote, I always get it.

12:53.627 --> 12:54.989
Don't worry about it.

12:55.009 --> 12:55.249
That's fine.

12:55.269 --> 12:57.793
Clean it up, will you?

12:57.833 --> 12:58.453
Make it work.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.216
Don't worry about that.

13:00.696 --> 13:07.605
I like the idea, and it's not even a direct quote I'm looking for, but the idea of getting control over the numbers is ... Yeah, yeah.

13:07.626 --> 13:11.050
I mean, the strange thing is, at the same time, they want to get control over the numbers,

13:11.907 --> 13:19.296
of the physical, the book collection, and keep it steady, in a steady state, rather than, you know, the expanding universe.

13:19.316 --> 13:25.102
They really want to change the idea of the universe of books.

13:25.503 --> 13:29.588
At the same time, they want to build a new building because they're still in the real estate business.

13:29.608 --> 13:33.552
They're still excited by the idea of big buildings.

13:33.572 --> 13:35.194
So they build a big building.

13:35.214 --> 13:36.516
And they're being built everywhere, by the way.

13:36.536 --> 13:36.676
Right.

13:37.057 --> 13:41.762
So they build the new building, but the actual book storage part

13:42.080 --> 13:53.538
Part of the idea of building the big building was that this is the final... No, this is not the big solution.

13:53.558 --> 13:58.386
This is the... This is going to finally get the problem under control.

13:59.187 --> 14:09.724
We're going to have more and more of the books that are on the shelf are going to go into digital storage, and therefore there's going to be a kind of one-for-one

14:11.780 --> 14:14.368
trade of new books for old books.

14:15.251 --> 14:20.507
Have you followed this controversy lately with the

14:21.415 --> 14:26.803
ensuring the longevity of digital material, you know, the fact that this stuff doesn't even last ten years?

14:26.843 --> 14:36.858
Yeah, you know, Scientific American did a big thing on that, and now the New York Times, and then I just saw it more recently somewhere like Business Week or something.

14:36.878 --> 14:37.338
Yeah, U.S.

14:37.399 --> 14:38.480
News did it.

14:38.500 --> 14:38.620
U.S.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.281
News, yeah.

14:39.341 --> 14:46.512
I mean, this is something that, you know, I knew this from back in the eighties, because I,

14:46.863 --> 14:53.610
I was—my big strength as a temp was on the Wang system.

14:53.630 --> 14:56.734
Well, the Wang software is not TOS.

14:57.395 --> 14:57.975
It wasn't.

14:57.995 --> 15:07.025
And it was—and all the skills that were involved in being a good Wang word processor are not transferable except for the ASCII keyboard.

15:07.045 --> 15:11.570
In addition, they used huge—they weren't five-and-a-quarter-inch diskettes.

15:11.610 --> 15:14.313
They were, I don't know, nine-inch diskettes.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.836
And there were

15:17.035 --> 15:19.999
millions of those diskettes in law firms all over the city.

15:21.081 --> 15:22.002
That was around here, right?

15:22.202 --> 15:23.304
Yeah, I worked here, yeah.

15:23.324 --> 15:24.666
As a temp for whom now?

15:25.387 --> 15:26.689
Dozens and dozens of them.

15:26.709 --> 15:27.870
So you were a computer guy?

15:27.890 --> 15:29.613
Office specialists, yeah.

15:29.633 --> 15:34.560
And I wrote, you know, Wang macros to put footnotes in things.

15:35.641 --> 15:38.505
You know, I felt I knew what I was doing with that.

15:38.606 --> 15:41.810
And this was maybe 83, right?

15:42.571 --> 15:46.637
Well, then I would go into

15:47.174 --> 15:53.160
offices that were all in the throes of conversion problems in 83, 84, 85.

15:53.200 --> 15:57.664
They would be converting from the old deck machines, or there were linear.

15:58.545 --> 16:00.307
Oh, these things are forgotten.

16:00.687 --> 16:02.229
They're impossible to access them.

16:02.249 --> 16:02.429
Right.

16:02.870 --> 16:09.696
And the conversion programs were—you would lose things in the conversion—so I'd already gone through this whole process once.

16:09.756 --> 16:16.303
And then at the same time I bought a K-Pro, a K-Pro 2X, which was, you know,

16:16.722 --> 16:19.706
a kind of nice portable computer, but it was CPM.

16:20.407 --> 16:26.695
So from 1985 through 1993, all my computer files were written in CPM.

16:26.796 --> 16:30.621
So I then had to go, and I still have my CPM computer.

16:30.701 --> 16:37.150
It's still bootable, but those disks, as soon as that computer stops working, those disks will be unreadable.

16:37.470 --> 16:39.092
So naturally I've had to convert.

16:39.573 --> 16:44.940
I've had to get conversion programs, convert it to DOS, then convert it to...

16:45.325 --> 16:50.834
to the version of AmiPro I was running and then converted from AmiPro to a later version of AmiPro to work.

16:51.095 --> 16:56.944
So the whole migration path stuff is stuff that I've been seeing for over a decade now.

16:56.964 --> 16:59.288
All of the interviews I did for General Madness are on.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.914
The transcriptions are on these five and a half inch.

17:03.235 --> 17:04.817
Of course, I still got the old computer.

17:05.278 --> 17:05.899
It's struggling.

17:05.939 --> 17:06.480
It's wheezing.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.462
It's coughing along.

17:07.822 --> 17:08.804
But I'm not getting rid of it.

17:08.864 --> 17:11.248
It accepts these disks.

17:11.313 --> 17:18.701
And so I haven't had the time, and I should finally just copy them over, and I'll be doing that.

17:18.961 --> 17:25.768
But it's even worse than that, like the tapes of the Voyager, the magnetic tapes of the Voyager missions.

17:26.629 --> 17:26.889
Right, right.

17:26.909 --> 17:39.582
No, I know, the fact that I might have lost data and stuff with my own little, I actually have, I can now search on my little compact computer there, I can search all of my written files from

17:39.848 --> 17:45.475
all my computer files, not my Olivetti portable typewriter files, but my computer files since 1985.

17:45.535 --> 17:46.657
So I haven't lost anything.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.022
And the loss isn't for somebody like me.

17:51.042 --> 17:58.411
It's for all of the Weather Service and all these vast agencies who manage huge databases and stuff is lost.

17:58.572 --> 18:01.616
I didn't mean to get into this, but I was at the, you know, for this book.

18:01.976 --> 18:03.578
But I went to, it started breaking.

18:04.030 --> 18:10.217
I just made contact with Jeff Rothenberg, and we have a computer conversation going, and we're going to talk this week.

18:11.579 --> 18:17.646
But I went out to this new Archives II building in Maryland, you know, which is the second only in size to the Pentagon.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.067
It is something to see.

18:19.087 --> 18:28.418
Five billion pieces of paper in here, you know, and yet how much the percentage of government business is going to be like 70 percent electronic.

18:29.056 --> 18:31.119
and they're not keeping all of it, you know?

18:32.301 --> 18:37.268
You see that order, that edict thing, you're supposed to get rid of all the email when you... That's why I went out there.

18:37.368 --> 18:40.213
I mean I do follow up on these stories immediately.

18:40.433 --> 18:44.038
So I hate to go off on that track here.

18:44.239 --> 18:52.431
No, the whole thing, the whole, I mean that's what got me involved in the cart catalog in the first place, was that

18:52.816 --> 18:56.120
I just want to see where we are on the tape.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.382
Yeah, yeah.

18:58.243 --> 19:11.399
Here we had the equivalent of a backup, a snapshot of what had been the state-of-the-art software of its time.

19:12.640 --> 19:21.591
And you didn't need to get new hardware or fiddle around with

19:22.381 --> 19:25.945
you know, compatibility problems in order for it to be legible.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.448
It was permanently legible.

19:29.529 --> 19:51.814
And so it seems the perfect kind of thing that you'd want to save if you want to have, because all those other handwritten online catalogs that are now being phased out as they get in and back and everything, those, there's no way necessarily to freeze what was in all those libraries as of a given date.

19:52.081 --> 19:56.029
I'll show you in my bag here.

19:56.049 --> 19:57.912
I'm going up to the Athenaeum to get some books.

19:57.932 --> 20:04.465
I usually do my search on the Hollis, the Harvard at home, and then I go up to the Athenaeum because it's cheaper.

20:04.565 --> 20:06.288
They have 98 percent of what I'm looking for.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.013
But I do my searching.

20:09.033 --> 20:14.123
Well, I've been looking for Hernando Columbus's history

20:14.862 --> 20:18.787
biography of his father, because I did the Columbus Library in Seville.

20:18.807 --> 20:19.848
It's a beautiful little story.

20:19.868 --> 20:21.530
It's in my next marriage, a bibliothese.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.392
It's in the end of the book.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.475
But I want to read this biography of his father in English.

20:26.196 --> 20:29.761
I searched Harvard, and you'll see here, it's got 2,000 items on Columbus.

20:29.861 --> 20:33.826
I went through every friggin' one of them, and it doesn't have it.

20:34.006 --> 20:40.334
So then I'm going through another guy's new book on Columbus, and he references a book edited by a guy named Dean.

20:41.736 --> 20:42.557
Yeah, I've got it here.

20:42.841 --> 20:45.845
So now I go back to Hollis and I search for Dean.

20:46.086 --> 20:46.927
Within a year or without?

20:47.107 --> 20:47.768
No, whatever it is.

20:47.828 --> 20:49.871
It doesn't matter.

20:49.912 --> 20:51.354
He never showed up in Columbus.

20:51.854 --> 20:52.756
Now it shows up.

20:52.796 --> 20:53.297
There it is.

20:53.817 --> 20:54.819
Totally different.

20:54.839 --> 20:58.544
The title is Fernando Columbus's History of His Father.

20:58.785 --> 21:02.470
It did not show up in the Columbus space, but it showed up when I did a search of Dean.

21:03.211 --> 21:03.992
Now I've got the book.

21:04.012 --> 21:07.077
It's there, but if I believe that stupid...

21:07.259 --> 21:10.084
The first thing I searched, it wasn't there.

21:10.224 --> 21:17.736
I mean, you have to learn the tricks of alternative maneuverings around the—I'll show it to you in a second.

21:17.756 --> 21:18.838
That's a perfect example.

21:18.858 --> 21:26.790
I mean, what actually you're losing—it's not a question of one antiquated paper-based system versus the electronic system.

21:27.331 --> 21:32.760
It's that the electronic system, for defensible reasons, removes

21:33.196 --> 21:40.406
the human judgment from the act of finding the links between books, and substitutes them with alphabetically based ones.

21:40.506 --> 21:51.441
And so that, you know, somebody who had been thinking about those cards would have obviously thought, well, we've got to have a card in Columbia.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.043
I would have gone straight to Hernando.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.164
See, I was going for the son.

21:54.865 --> 21:56.427
Or he was also known as Ferdinand.

21:56.447 --> 21:59.932
So anyway, I went to Ferdinand, I went to Fernando, I went to Hernando.

21:59.992 --> 22:02.055
I mean, all these different names that he's known by.

22:02.761 --> 22:07.088
was popping it up.

22:07.108 --> 22:11.554
I'll show it to you when we're done, but I found it.

22:12.115 --> 22:15.961
It took me an hour of just screwing around just last night to do it.

22:16.222 --> 22:21.890
On the other hand, the great thing is that you talk about serendipity with cards is nice and serendipity with browsing is nice.

22:22.331 --> 22:23.773
There's also, of course,

22:24.158 --> 22:27.324
There's online serendipity and electronics.

22:27.344 --> 22:33.455
It's just that those serendipitous moments are entirely different.

22:33.475 --> 22:34.777
They give you a different universe.

22:35.499 --> 22:37.542
I'll give you a perfect example.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.107
I'm going to write a story about it.

22:40.147 --> 22:43.173
Maybe for the globe or somebody in Philly might want to take it.

22:44.495 --> 22:47.280
For the duration of this research, I bought a LexisNexis

22:48.003 --> 22:49.545
Well, that's not bad.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.688
It's not bad.

22:51.789 --> 22:53.010
It's a personal one.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.012
It's called a requester.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.915
I don't get access to the law, the legal.

22:56.135 --> 22:57.117
I don't need them.

22:57.938 --> 23:06.891
But I was lazy one day, and I was trying to find, I mean, I got all my books upstairs, and I wanted to get some background on just some factual stuff on the Rosetta Stone.

23:07.151 --> 23:07.973
Right.

23:07.993 --> 23:10.116
So I searched Rosetta Stone.

23:10.136 --> 23:11.418
I get a hundred stories.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.664
Not one of them has anything to do with the Rosetta Stone.

23:16.083 --> 23:19.667
this is the Rosetta Stone of gastrointestinal research.

23:19.747 --> 23:22.970
This is the Rosetta Stone of baseball."

23:22.990 --> 23:32.640
And I said, I had no idea how profoundly this phrase has entered the language, and nobody ever tells you what the Rosetta Stone is.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.141
And I copied them all.

23:34.161 --> 23:36.243
I saved them all to disk, and they're funny, you know?

23:36.263 --> 23:37.364
This is the Rosetta Stone.

23:37.705 --> 23:41.889
She has written what will be the Rosetta Stone of Mexican cooking.

23:42.990 --> 23:45.112
I mean, I can't remember, but they're hilarious.

23:45.152 --> 23:46.073
Some of the quotes

23:47.251 --> 23:50.136
But the computer did exactly what I asked it to look for.

23:50.276 --> 23:51.578
Looked for a Rosetta Stone.

23:51.739 --> 23:51.959
Right.

23:51.979 --> 23:59.572
So you've got a wonderful rear diagonal cut through culture without actually learning about it.

23:59.632 --> 24:01.415
And it cuts across sports, business.

24:02.417 --> 24:03.479
That's the amazing thing.

24:03.539 --> 24:05.843
That phrase is used in all segments.

24:05.883 --> 24:07.025
It was in Business Week.

24:07.045 --> 24:08.207
It was in Sports Illustrated.

24:08.267 --> 24:11.993
It was in Popular Mechanics, you know, because Lex Next gives you all that.

24:12.682 --> 24:21.234
And I determined I will never use the phrase Rosetta Stone again in my own writing, because I had no idea that it would become such a cliche.

24:21.554 --> 24:22.035
Maybe I will.

24:22.055 --> 24:27.822
That's the scary thing about those quick searches, is that you get tired of something so fast.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.246
But this is over a period of my years, you know.

24:30.306 --> 24:37.896
But you can look forward to the kind of Rosetta Stones that we'll need, or we,

24:38.399 --> 24:50.537
cryptographers in the future will need in order to figure out—you know, they've got a CPM version of a document and— This was the context that I was using it in.

24:50.717 --> 25:01.993
Yeah, and they'll have to then compare, find the—and I mean, people will get quite better at

25:02.395 --> 25:03.536
decoding this stuff.

25:03.556 --> 25:05.959
But the interesting thing was that, was it Rothenberg?

25:06.400 --> 25:07.561
Jeff Rothenberg, yeah.

25:07.581 --> 25:13.548
Yeah, the interesting thing was his worried, you don't know where things start and stop in the data stream.

25:13.568 --> 25:14.068
Do you have that story?

25:14.088 --> 25:15.049
I'd be happy to send it to you.

25:15.069 --> 25:15.770
Yeah, I got that one.

25:15.790 --> 25:17.532
Because it's a tough one to find.

25:17.612 --> 25:18.654
It's scientific.

25:18.674 --> 25:21.337
Yeah, because I subscribe to a scientific American, yeah.

25:21.357 --> 25:22.037
I finally got it.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.882
Plus he updated it, and he told me how to get it on a PDF.

25:25.922 --> 25:26.563
I have to read it.

25:26.583 --> 25:29.826
He updated the story, the article, but it's not published anywhere.

25:29.846 --> 25:31.288
It's only available at a site.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.634
I'll be happy... T.S.P.

25:33.654 --> 25:36.518
Yeah, I have to get a Dolby reader to read it.

25:36.538 --> 25:37.759
The acrobat thing?

25:37.799 --> 25:38.059
Yeah.

25:38.820 --> 25:40.963
But I'll be happy to send you an e-mail.

25:41.003 --> 25:43.326
You can probably access the story if you'd like.

25:43.586 --> 25:44.487
What's your e-mail address?

25:44.547 --> 25:45.268
I'll send it to you.

25:45.528 --> 25:46.870
Hey, you know what?

25:46.890 --> 25:47.330
I'm clean.

25:47.410 --> 25:48.331
I'm clean and sober.

25:49.192 --> 25:49.673
You are?

25:49.773 --> 25:50.194
I'm off.

25:50.594 --> 25:52.096
I'm unplugged.

25:53.157 --> 25:54.158
I mean, I have an account.

25:54.258 --> 25:59.925
I've had the same account that I've had since 1993, but it was such a joy when I was in England

26:00.142 --> 26:03.668
not to have to check that damn mailbox every day.

26:04.429 --> 26:04.769
Really?

26:04.970 --> 26:07.033
And lose the time answering.

26:07.073 --> 26:15.947
So I have not, you know, I used to read The Well, too, which is a place where writers go and, you know, journalists and stuff.

26:15.967 --> 26:21.576
But now the only time I use the net is if I'm doing some research

26:22.805 --> 26:28.433
I look up something using a search engine and stuff, but I don't do any email.

26:28.773 --> 26:29.334
It's not good.

26:29.394 --> 26:31.056
It's just a personal decision.

26:31.076 --> 26:33.920
I love it because I don't have to add to a lot of telephone.

26:35.062 --> 26:37.786
You can do a lot of stuff quite expeditiously.

26:39.188 --> 26:52.626
Yeah, I just got the feeling sometimes when I would be setting up a lunch date with somebody, and there would be four emails going back and forth, and if you added up the minutes spent, I'd spend 45 minutes setting up this

26:53.062 --> 26:58.107
lunch date, practically as much time as I would have spent having lunch with the person, doing these things.

26:58.207 --> 26:58.967
And it wasn't fun.

26:59.188 --> 27:12.820
I mean, I think if it's fun, and if it's a joy to link up to all the people, it's one thing, but, you know, I've got a family, I've got a, you know, I like reading, actually.

27:12.900 --> 27:21.448
I mean, and I find that reading much more as a result of not... I like reading, actually.

27:22.222 --> 27:30.813
Let's move over briefly to the Lewinsky thing, and then we'll talk about the new book.

27:31.093 --> 27:32.715
Okay.

27:32.735 --> 27:32.875
Yeah.

27:32.895 --> 27:37.441
But it seems to me controversy catches up with you, even when you're not doing anything.

27:37.941 --> 27:39.924
I mean, minding your own business.

27:40.445 --> 27:42.006
It's bizarre, isn't it?

27:42.027 --> 27:42.207
Yeah.

27:42.587 --> 27:43.949
I mean, the New Yorker piece is fine.

27:43.969 --> 27:45.090
You took affirmative steps.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.292
You wrote some stories.

27:46.492 --> 27:48.094
Right.

27:48.361 --> 27:51.365
came, you know, I mean, you're culpable there.

27:51.385 --> 27:56.292
I mean, you know, you knew it was coming, and that's to be expected.

27:56.312 --> 27:56.953
That's right.

27:56.973 --> 28:00.597
Here, this is a book you wrote in 1992 or whatever it is, or 93.

28:01.759 --> 28:09.429
And here we are six years later, and you're drawn into the Lewinsky-Clinton imbroglio.

28:09.449 --> 28:13.595
Well, I mean, what a delightful thing to be part of a major news story.

28:14.015 --> 28:17.440
I mean, I've

28:18.787 --> 28:26.878
I never imagined—I mean, I guess the idea is that—the first thing to say is that there's no confirmation of this.

28:27.999 --> 28:39.254
That Star—the Star's team, they're adept at leaking things, but then when things don't turn out very well, they stop leaking things.

28:39.314 --> 28:45.041
And there's no—you know, nobody seems to be having—there's no second source for this.

28:45.322 --> 28:48.726
In fact, I can't even find out where the original leak came from.

28:49.803 --> 28:54.450
That's the insidious nature of these leaks, though, in Sol's stories.

28:54.470 --> 28:55.191
We never find out.

28:55.211 --> 28:55.331
Right.

28:55.351 --> 28:56.874
And you don't know the motive for the leak.

28:57.054 --> 29:19.067
Is the motive for the leak to demonstrate that there's some relevancy to the idea of harassing a bookstore for its records because it has to do with the—or is it just simply to demonstrate that Lewinsky's a kind of loose woman, therefore she's the kind of woman who would read a book like Vox, and therefore

29:19.672 --> 29:20.653
you know, look at her?

29:21.694 --> 29:22.495
I mean, is it that kind of thing?

29:22.515 --> 29:32.867
Well, no, I think it's to suggest that some people were saying, you know, this Linda Tripp thing, apparently, was that she engaged in phone sex.

29:33.007 --> 29:36.291
She tells Tripp, with Clinton.

29:36.471 --> 29:46.062
Now, you're looking for ways, independent ways, external ways, to prove that maybe this happened.

29:46.082 --> 29:46.202
Right.

29:46.975 --> 29:50.398
Maybe she bought this book and gave it to him.

29:51.079 --> 29:53.100
Well, and the idea is he admitted to getting books.

29:53.621 --> 30:09.875
So the thrilling idea would be that she, I mean thrilling from one point of view, thrilling to me as just kind of an amused bystander.

30:11.156 --> 30:16.881
It's delightful to think that Lewinsky gave Clinton

30:17.114 --> 30:27.326
my own book, this book that came out of my head, that, you know, just bought a paperback and gave it to him, and then it was traveling around in Air Force One, you know, whatever was happening.

30:27.366 --> 30:28.768
That's a delightful fantasy.

30:31.231 --> 30:45.889
But it seems, if you shift your perspective slightly, it's appalling that the legal system is being employed

30:46.207 --> 30:53.595
to squeeze that kind of information, private information, out of a bookstore.

30:55.637 --> 30:58.680
Lewinsky had absolutely no interest in revealing it.

30:59.261 --> 31:15.758
I just think it's an abuse of good faith and legal tact and anything that we think of as important in

31:15.940 --> 31:16.741
maintaining.

31:17.021 --> 31:34.138
Part of the way of nourishing the legal system is that you don't use this kind of, you know, 80-pound sledgehammer to get at a fact that's simply an interesting, gossipy corroboration, you know?

31:34.158 --> 31:43.467
Yeah, but even beyond that, I mean, the scarier issue is, I mean, people's reading habits.

31:43.868 --> 31:48.177
Does a guy on a fishing expedition have the right to go and try and determine?

31:48.197 --> 31:57.817
I mean, what bothers me about computerized borrowing cards from libraries is that there's now a computerized record of every book that you've borrowed from the library.

31:57.837 --> 32:00.703
And I know when I was a book reviewer, I spent thirteen years.

32:00.723 --> 32:01.865
This is hot.

32:01.905 --> 32:03.649
No, I actually like your quote, thank you.

32:04.270 --> 32:15.639
I used to feel that I was really privy to really confidential information, what people liked to read, things they were particularly passionate about reading.

32:15.819 --> 32:20.912
And I consider that almost like being a confessor, you know what I mean?

32:21.196 --> 32:27.645
And all of a sudden, I don't know, I have to check the McCarthy years, but did McCarthy try and go after people's reading stuff, do you know?

32:27.685 --> 32:35.757
I don't know, but the unfortunate thing is that this practice, more recently, was pioneered by the other side.

32:36.358 --> 32:39.903
Bork's video rental records were made public.

32:39.943 --> 32:45.250
Remember when the Bork, the Judge Bork, what they did was, they didn't want Bork in there.

32:45.791 --> 32:50.578
So they got the, well, you know, I mean, you can definitely

32:50.710 --> 32:52.673
disagree with somebody on his principles.

32:53.274 --> 33:00.204
But what they did is exposed his videotape rental records, because there were embarrassing things in there, I guess.

33:00.264 --> 33:00.945
I don't actually know.

33:01.766 --> 33:02.727
Are they pornotapes then?

33:03.148 --> 33:03.549
I don't know.

33:04.109 --> 33:12.301
Because I think that the group kind of exposed it, but the press hadn't sunk quite to the level that they're at now.

33:12.802 --> 33:19.992
And so they weren't going to say, you know, that he was publishing Three Girls and a Dog or whatever it was that he was renting.

33:20.053 --> 33:20.413
I don't know.

33:20.613 --> 33:21.514
I don't know if it was that.

33:21.554 --> 33:22.035
I don't even know.

33:23.576 --> 33:25.298
I corroborate everything independently.

33:25.318 --> 33:25.598
Right.

33:25.739 --> 33:30.023
But to say, you know, Packwood's diaries, I mean— Well, that's different, though.

33:30.043 --> 33:31.004
That's not reading.

33:31.325 --> 33:32.186
That's just diaries.

33:32.386 --> 33:33.447
Yeah, you're right.

33:33.467 --> 33:33.988
That's different.

33:34.008 --> 33:34.748
That's a different thing.

33:34.788 --> 33:44.619
But as far as the record of the consumption of these symbolic things, videos or books, it was pioneered by the left.

33:44.639 --> 33:45.740
That's the sad fact.

33:45.901 --> 33:47.262
I mean, in recent memory.

33:47.461 --> 33:48.442
I don't know about McCarthy.

33:48.462 --> 33:58.975
Well, I'm going to go back and check McCarthy, because there was a statement that, you know, the freedom to read, which I'm told came out in the 1950s out of the Des Moines Public Library of all places.

33:58.995 --> 34:03.721
The Midwest is a very interesting area of book culture, which I'm going to write about in this new book.

34:05.623 --> 34:08.827
And apparently it was inspired by the McCarthy stuff.

34:09.067 --> 34:11.250
I mean, it just seems like the kind of thing he would do.

34:11.490 --> 34:15.495
I mean, to smear somebody as a truce or that you read, you know.

34:15.996 --> 34:17.097
Right.

34:17.330 --> 34:19.533
played by Arthur Miller or something like that.

34:19.553 --> 34:25.841
You read that, you know, Arthur Miller or, you know, anyone who might have had leftist tendencies, you could smear them.

34:26.642 --> 34:39.459
My feeling also, on the other hand, is if you're making a case against the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, now this guy's been charged with mass murder, or Timothy McVeigh charged with mass murder, their reading came into these matters as well.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.741
I love that lead.

34:40.781 --> 34:42.223
There was a New York Times piece.

34:42.524 --> 34:49.370
that Starr came under attack for having subpoenaed the Cramer Books records, and Barnes & Noble, I think, by that time.

34:49.770 --> 35:00.920
And so the team defended themselves, saying, well, McVeigh, you know, the Unabomber stuff was subpoenaed, and McVeigh's stuff was subpoenaed, so of course we have the right to subpoena Lewinsky.

35:01.521 --> 35:05.104
But the point is that Lewinsky actually— He's charged with nothing.

35:05.564 --> 35:11.890
You know, the worst that she's done is just have an affair with the president, for crying out loud.

35:12.089 --> 35:13.911
Well, not only that, she's not charged with a crime.

35:14.031 --> 35:14.232
Yes.

35:14.252 --> 35:15.093
There's no crime.

35:15.233 --> 35:15.693
There's no crime.

35:15.713 --> 35:16.394
No allegations.

35:16.434 --> 35:20.539
No stuff going around, but she doesn't stand accused legally of anything.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.260
Right, right, right.

35:21.300 --> 35:40.324
So the other strange irony, well, the other irony for me is that one of the things that interested me in writing the book, Fox, was that these two characters, who never saw each other, were able to maintain some

35:41.840 --> 35:45.345
a strange quality of privacy.

35:45.805 --> 35:47.728
Their lives weren't touching.

35:48.389 --> 35:55.358
You know, they were on the phone and they were telling stories to each other and having this interesting intimacy.

35:55.378 --> 35:56.199
Very good point.

35:56.580 --> 36:05.732
But they were, neither of them really knew what the other was reading or what each other's apartments looked like or anything about it.

36:05.752 --> 36:08.235
So the book was about

36:08.722 --> 36:18.876
different kinds of privacy and what things do you allow yourself to reveal and what things do you hold back at different points in a conversation and things.

36:19.537 --> 36:38.222
So the idea that this book now would be kind of used as a fulcrum to unearth private things that Lewinsky never would have told the world is kind of sad.

36:38.793 --> 36:46.862
But I understand, I read someplace that they actually, Random House went out and printed another edition, did another printing of rocks, is that right?

36:47.402 --> 37:00.277
Yeah, I guess they, I mean, from the point of view, I don't see any of the, I think vintage, well, I mean, any writer's happy when, I mean, I'm delighted when any human being buys my book.

37:00.577 --> 37:08.766
Right, you know, but I don't actually see any of the money because of the way these advances have to be paid back.

37:09.202 --> 37:11.185
I'm not talking about the money.

37:11.285 --> 37:36.002
But the printing, the idea that suddenly a book will be in play, I felt it was of its time, and that in some ways I feel that it was maybe partly responsible for a kind of flowering of graphic smirkiness that I don't

37:36.944 --> 37:44.013
even want, you know, that I was part of the early phase of something that's gotten out of hand, you know, or something.

37:44.033 --> 37:52.404
And then, of course, I wrote the Fermata, which is, it's far, far worse in a way, as far as, you know, smirky pornography.

37:52.484 --> 37:54.326
So what can you do?

37:54.346 --> 37:57.130
So let's move from that and the Fermata.

37:58.272 --> 38:04.099
Were these phases in your, now we're moving to the new book, were these phases, were these part of the arc of your

38:04.450 --> 38:11.877
Yeah, I guess it doesn't, it doesn't, the career doesn't seem to have an arc-like shape.

38:12.137 --> 38:34.018
There's no, I mean, it seems to be a more of a, um, it feels more as if I'm, I've got a large level plane with a lot of different colored boxes on it.

38:34.454 --> 38:38.959
and each one being a subject matter or something that I'm interested in.

38:38.999 --> 38:49.691
And I kind of do my best to describe one of these pieces of reality and then move on to the next one.

38:49.711 --> 39:03.786
So I feel as if I'm just sort of taking these little diagonal jaunts and trying to cover all the bases or get my croquet ball through all the wickets, rather than that there's some

39:05.757 --> 39:10.283
some shape, and there'll be a keystone, and then there'll be a long, gradual decline.

39:10.984 --> 39:12.846
There'll be a lot of aimless wandering.

39:12.866 --> 39:16.591
I just did an interview with Mary Gordon and her new book, which is interesting.

39:16.611 --> 39:23.960
I don't know if you know Mary, but this is really, she's just written, what is for her, a naughty book.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.943
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

39:26.023 --> 39:26.764
It's fun.

39:26.824 --> 39:30.128
It's an erotic comedy.

39:30.547 --> 39:40.300
And I said to her, Mary, you know, we've done four interviews over the years, and you had told me earlier, you know, she's very uncomfortable writing about male sexuality and empathizing, blah, blah, blah.

39:40.881 --> 39:42.343
And I said, what happened?

39:42.403 --> 39:43.585
She said, well, I had a son.

39:44.827 --> 39:48.011
You know, all of a sudden, you know, I've come to that.

39:48.171 --> 39:50.214
I, number one, understand children.

39:50.354 --> 39:51.456
I understand males.

39:52.077 --> 39:55.221
And I love my son, and I feel I understand.

39:55.281 --> 39:58.866
And now I've had to bring myself to the realization that

39:59.251 --> 40:01.074
that all men aren't from outer space.

40:01.094 --> 40:01.875
They aren't the other.

40:02.896 --> 40:19.982
That's a long way of getting into, I wonder, especially in view of the dedication of this new novel, if being a dad, having a daughter, having children in some way, this is a book that I think could not have been written by Nicholson Baker prior to being a father.

40:20.343 --> 40:20.944
No, no.

40:21.024 --> 40:21.925
Maybe that's whack.

40:21.945 --> 40:22.786
Oh, there's no question.

40:22.846 --> 40:23.768
Actually, none of the books.

40:23.788 --> 40:25.310
Swinging at curveballs, I don't know.

40:25.330 --> 40:27.233
But actually, I did start writing

40:27.533 --> 40:31.699
until after I'd had a child, so I've always written.

40:32.099 --> 40:44.396
But you're quite right that the book is almost entirely based on the experiences that my own daughter had going to school in England.

40:45.036 --> 40:54.349
And there's no reason for, I mean, it's just, it's essentially, it's a really kind of primitive act of fatherly pride.

40:54.489 --> 40:56.612
That's great.

40:58.111 --> 41:03.257
I'm saying, well, here's this person, and nobody else has written about her, so I'm going to.

41:03.317 --> 41:04.518
It's my job to do that.

41:05.479 --> 41:09.624
I happen to know this human being better than anyone else.

41:09.744 --> 41:17.873
On the other hand, I did take liberties with... I mean, I didn't... It's a novel.

41:17.974 --> 41:19.015
It's a novel.

41:19.615 --> 41:26.363
Yeah, there's enough of my own invention and filtering and sorting

41:27.170 --> 41:32.658
and the kind of cleaning up of the chronology, because you just can't transplant.

41:34.841 --> 41:50.724
But on the other hand, I benefited hugely from the fact that even when I was making something up, I could go out of my office, if it were Saturday or Sunday, and say, Alice, how would you tell this story?

41:50.944 --> 41:51.345
Really?

41:51.585 --> 41:54.409
Can you give me an example of this?

41:55.334 --> 41:57.337
And how it got into the book?

41:57.758 --> 41:58.419
Let's see.

41:59.240 --> 42:08.234
I should back up.

42:09.496 --> 42:24.278
The main way that the book took shape was that I had a certain fund of knowledge about what this kid was like.

42:24.697 --> 42:25.939
But that didn't help me very much.

42:26.239 --> 42:30.886
What I had really was... Do you mind if I shoot a couple of pictures of you while you're talking, by the way?

42:30.946 --> 42:33.109
No, not at all.

42:33.129 --> 42:33.370
Okay, good.

42:33.390 --> 42:34.732
I like the hand gestures.

42:34.812 --> 42:43.284
What I had were these interviews that I did of her after I'd pick her up at school.

42:44.166 --> 42:48.272
I'd take her out to a place we would have tea near this cathedral.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.335
What was the cathedral, by the way?

42:50.715 --> 42:53.860
Oh, it was the Ely Cathedral, E-L-Y, Ely, England.

42:54.835 --> 43:24.133
and uh we'd go out and do you mind if i do the uh glasses off for you whatever you like um anyway so we would get we would uh we would meet after these things about almost about two or three times a week i guess and i would just ask what ha what what happened that day

43:24.367 --> 43:31.738
And when she would answer, she just told it in her own words.

43:31.818 --> 43:33.761
And it was fascinating.

43:33.781 --> 43:36.565
So the next day, I would write a scene.

43:36.585 --> 43:38.628
And that's how the book mostly took shape.

43:39.189 --> 43:46.019
But then in the cleaning up, well, then I would get interested in certain stories and things.

43:46.039 --> 43:48.523
And then I would, sometimes I would tell her a story.

43:48.583 --> 43:49.685
I don't want to give an exact.

43:51.167 --> 43:51.808
We're here.

43:53.459 --> 43:54.240
We'll be here.

43:55.963 --> 43:59.869
Sometimes I would tell her.

43:59.909 --> 44:09.403
I actually want to keep it a mystery which stories in the book are my own and which stories are hers.

44:09.583 --> 44:10.164
Okay, that's great.

44:10.184 --> 44:12.928
Because... Yeah.

44:17.114 --> 44:22.302
There's a nice...

44:24.037 --> 44:25.459
So I would tell her a story.

44:26.400 --> 44:26.901
You don't?

44:27.161 --> 44:28.262
Yeah, I would tell her a story.

44:28.843 --> 44:34.390
And she has, I think, a much better memory for narrative than I do.

44:35.011 --> 44:40.778
I don't know if it's because when you're a kid you've heard fewer stories, or if it's just because she's better.

44:40.799 --> 44:44.283
I think it's just because she's better at this.

44:44.363 --> 44:49.309
So then a couple weeks later I'd ask her to tell me the story that I'd told her.

44:50.151 --> 44:53.655
And inevitably she told it better than I did.

44:54.243 --> 45:00.590
And so in some cases my own story is filtered through her own sensibility.

45:00.610 --> 45:02.473
And this is while you were in England?

45:02.613 --> 45:04.295
So it was written on the spot, yeah.

45:04.555 --> 45:05.296
The book was written.

45:05.336 --> 45:10.802
When she was in school in England, the book was written in that first term in England.

45:10.842 --> 45:13.906
So what was the motivation for it?

45:14.507 --> 45:15.748
Well, I don't know.

45:15.788 --> 45:23.457
I just felt that, oh, well, the motivation was that I could see that this

45:24.533 --> 45:35.649
this kid, that this kid I love so much, was changing every year.

45:35.689 --> 45:52.853
You know, she was, she, certain ways that she used to speak, certain phrases that she used to use were disappearing, especially the language, but also the, you know,

45:53.255 --> 45:55.378
You know, she was understanding things a little better.

45:55.418 --> 46:17.711
And I felt a little panicky about having, about the prospect of losing some of the ways that she'd understood the world and felt that, you know, I had a real deadline, that if I didn't write the book then, that a whole fund of things, that I would forget certain things that were true of her.

46:18.832 --> 46:21.456
And the only way really to keep this

46:23.022 --> 46:36.939
this particular person, to keep a memory of her the way she was at a certain time, was to write a novel about her.

46:37.860 --> 46:38.921
Why didn't you do it in her voice?

46:40.143 --> 46:52.017
Because I'm not very keen about books that are written in the first person and kids' voices, because I've never known a kid

46:52.385 --> 46:53.406
who can write a novel.

46:54.608 --> 47:05.160
One of the things that the heroine in my story does is write stories, and she has ambitions to write long things, books and everything, but they always end to be continued.

47:05.641 --> 47:11.247
Because the salient thing about being a kid is that you're not going to write 200 pages.

47:11.287 --> 47:18.055
You're going to write seven pages and then be excited about the grand plan that never comes to fruition.

47:18.760 --> 47:31.438
So it has to be somewhere in that middle space between a third person and a first person, because it has to have a grown-up stick-to-itiveness that would result in a finished book.

47:33.081 --> 47:40.632
Also, I don't think it's just too easy to have.

47:41.192 --> 47:44.397
I mean, children don't even think in

47:44.680 --> 47:45.821
chapters in novels.

47:46.762 --> 47:48.284
So it has to be third person, I think.

47:48.304 --> 47:48.885
Anyway, go ahead.

47:48.985 --> 47:51.087
No, that's an excellent answer.

47:51.408 --> 47:54.671
You know, it's said that if J.D.

47:54.691 --> 47:59.637
Salinger were to write Catcher in the Rye today, it would be classified as a young adult novel.

47:59.697 --> 48:07.446
I mean, this is one of the risks you take in having your sensual character, your protagonist, being an adolescent.

48:08.587 --> 48:14.113
Were you mindful of any kind of, I hesitate to use the word risk, but I mean,

48:15.207 --> 48:21.173
Yeah, I'm talking about the business of writing now, not about the perception of the novel itself.

48:21.834 --> 48:24.957
The fact that you are writing this from the viewpoint of a child.

48:25.497 --> 48:42.835
Well, yeah, the other thing that I am always suspicious of is when the way that a writer attempts to prove that his book about a child is really for adults is that he uses the child's

48:43.388 --> 48:51.339
point of view to illuminate some dark truth about parental reality or about political upheaval or something like that.

48:51.980 --> 48:56.927
In other words, there's a deep, unhappy, unsettling thing in the middle of this book.

48:57.007 --> 49:00.412
Therefore, it's for adults.

49:02.135 --> 49:04.658
That also just seems false to me.

49:04.698 --> 49:06.841
It's too easy.

49:06.861 --> 49:12.349
If you do it right, if you can

49:12.548 --> 49:16.011
really do justice to the way a kid thinks.

49:16.972 --> 49:39.655
It's not that you're going to get a way of thinking that's superior to grown-up thinking, but you're going to get a particular completeness of understanding and misunderstanding that is intrinsically fascinating and worth studying just as a kind of case study of moral development.

49:39.675 --> 49:41.897
I mean, that's really what was

49:43.497 --> 50:12.711
was part of what I liked was all the, in addition to the verbal oddities and in some cases I thought felicities, at the childish texture of the book there was this fierceness on the part of the heroine

50:13.754 --> 50:18.540
to defend another girl who was persecuted.

50:18.580 --> 50:22.825
Obviously, there are many worse things that happen in the world.

50:23.666 --> 50:40.808
This is a very tame complication, but I've never been able to... I don't know anything about the really bad things, you know, airplane disasters,

50:41.378 --> 50:47.364
divorces or things like that, or massacres.

50:47.505 --> 51:01.139
I mean, the scale that a child lives on is a scale in which if somebody is being bullied, that's a disaster.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.342
And I think it is a disaster.

51:03.402 --> 51:08.247
I mean, I think we are very lucky to live in a culture in which

51:08.986 --> 51:22.046
an Anglo-American culture in which if a kid is made to cry because other kids in the school are kicking her, that's a very bad thing.

51:22.166 --> 51:30.879
I mean, I think we're fortunate there, but the scale doesn't matter in the sense I'm saying.

51:31.460 --> 51:37.609
If you can successfully scoop up some of the moral

51:39.698 --> 52:01.723
dimension of childhood and how a child has to sift through the claims of other children and what her parents think are right and all the stories that she has is kind of moving around in her head of how other people have acted.

52:01.743 --> 52:09.452
Then she has to make up her own stories, all of which have these strange—well, they're not strange, I think they're very typical.

52:10.090 --> 52:31.474
acts of helping little girls you know i mean she's got the burning rain she's lost in the sahara desert and once she finds a little girl who's even more burned than she is you know has to scoop her up and and and you know that their their clothes get torn on a cactus you know but the the little girl this is what's interesting this actually the burning rain is a very

52:32.720 --> 52:35.285
It's almost straight from Alice.

52:35.786 --> 52:37.891
It was dictated by her.

52:38.352 --> 52:39.174
I typed it out.

52:39.775 --> 52:41.559
All I did was add a little punctuation.

52:43.202 --> 52:48.433
She said, I'm really afraid of forgetting this story.

52:48.717 --> 52:49.718
She said to you?

52:50.039 --> 52:50.299
Yeah.

52:50.319 --> 52:52.743
She said, I'm telling a lot of stories about this girl.

52:52.763 --> 52:53.083
When was this?

52:53.123 --> 52:54.245
This was in England?

52:54.265 --> 52:56.247
This was just before we left for England.

52:56.488 --> 52:57.209
Just before you left?

52:57.229 --> 52:57.569
Yeah.

52:57.669 --> 52:59.432
She said, I'm really afraid.

52:59.452 --> 53:02.116
I'm telling all these stories about Mariana, this girl in Mariana.

53:02.156 --> 53:03.818
This could be my lead, by the way.

53:03.878 --> 53:05.560
I always like to know my lead when I leave.

53:06.302 --> 53:07.683
And the way I might kick her, too.

53:07.703 --> 53:08.685
So I think I got both.

53:08.705 --> 53:08.925
Go ahead.

53:08.945 --> 53:11.569
So she said, I'm going to forget it.

53:11.809 --> 53:13.011
I don't know how to do it.

53:13.031 --> 53:14.593
I can't write it down because it's too long.

53:14.673 --> 53:16.716
I'm going to forget it next.

53:16.983 --> 53:19.766
How old was she at this point?

53:19.786 --> 53:28.256
Um, she was, uh, I guess she was, um, she just had her eighth birthday, I guess.

53:28.737 --> 53:33.362
I mean, yeah, she was just having her ninth birthday, I'm sorry, I think.

53:34.123 --> 53:36.366
Actually, I can't, I'd have to check that.

53:36.386 --> 53:37.387
Okay, but how old is she now?

53:38.048 --> 53:39.029
She's now ten.

53:39.069 --> 53:40.010
She was nine in England.

53:40.631 --> 53:41.972
So that's just about eight or nine.

53:42.112 --> 53:42.493
Yeah, yeah.

53:43.054 --> 53:45.977
And so we were driving around when she said this,

53:46.598 --> 54:01.339
And so I just pulled out my computer, and I think my son was asleep in the back, and we were just doing errands.

54:01.379 --> 54:04.424
And so I just typed it out as she dictated the story.

54:04.624 --> 54:05.565
So you stopped the card?

54:05.585 --> 54:12.315
Stopped the card, typed it out, and I think she felt very relieved, you know, that I had... That you'd recorded it?

54:12.435 --> 54:15.660
Recorded it.

54:16.012 --> 54:17.614
And I know she's pleased.

54:18.054 --> 54:19.836
That's one of the things she's read in the book.

54:19.856 --> 54:29.007
She hasn't read the book from cover to cover, but she's very pleased that some of her stories are in there, more or less, that she told them.

54:29.027 --> 54:32.651
Did you discuss with her while this was in process that you're using her?

54:32.871 --> 54:36.876
Yeah, because I wouldn't have used... That's an important question.

54:36.896 --> 54:39.259
Yeah, I asked her... You need her permission, I think.

54:39.779 --> 54:40.740
Absolutely.

54:40.961 --> 54:44.685
I need her to have credit, too.

54:46.353 --> 54:55.522
It's strange because the story would never have been written down if I didn't have some urge to write it down, you know.

54:55.602 --> 54:58.165
But it's entirely from her head.

54:58.685 --> 55:05.833
And so the book is really more a collaboration than any, well certainly more, it's definitely a collaboration.

55:05.853 --> 55:13.120
I mean it's not, it's almost as if I'm a ghostwriter, you know.

55:14.483 --> 55:28.416
I was thinking, although I add my own, sometimes my own autobiographical pet peeves and my feelings about certain things intrude from time to time in my own stories.

55:28.756 --> 55:43.630
But I only wrote stories that after I'd really gotten into her voice, I went back and wrote some stories that were the way I think she would have told the story.

55:44.116 --> 56:00.820
But even then I wanted to be sure, and so she would tell the story back to me, and then sometimes I would incorporate a particular way that she told it rather than I felt like one of those guys like Prop, you know, who did the metamorphosis of folktales or something.

56:01.060 --> 56:13.498
In a strange way, I felt like an anthropologist or something rather than a novelist that's quite as much, although I wanted to have this kind of

56:14.221 --> 56:21.934
complicated, realistic texture that only a novel can have, you know.

56:22.535 --> 56:24.919
I haven't really questioned you about the novel itself.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.584
I try not to do that with novels.

56:27.664 --> 56:33.794
I read them and it's my business to, you know, if it seems like we're not discussing the novel.

56:34.175 --> 56:35.197
We are discussing it.

56:35.217 --> 56:37.140
But I mean in terms of the actual

56:37.306 --> 56:39.048
Right, right.

56:39.930 --> 56:43.054
Well, I mean, you seem to know what it's about.

56:43.094 --> 56:45.157
It's about a nine-year-old person.

56:45.197 --> 56:47.099
It doesn't bother me in life.

56:47.119 --> 56:52.447
As long as you understand how I, you know, I have a responsibility here to read it.

56:52.507 --> 57:00.538
I did two interviews in Denver, both of which were with people who had not read the novel at all.

57:00.658 --> 57:01.699
I mean, they looked at the cover.

57:02.541 --> 57:03.442
They were honest about it.

57:03.722 --> 57:05.845
And that actually can work okay, too.

57:06.365 --> 57:07.526
Well, if they're honest about it.

57:07.686 --> 57:08.947
Yeah.

57:08.967 --> 57:16.655
If they don't pretend to— Because then it becomes the kind of conversation you'd have at a party or something, where the person says, what do you do?

57:16.715 --> 57:17.796
And you say, oh, well, what's it about?

57:17.816 --> 57:18.496
What's it about?

57:18.516 --> 57:19.177
Don't you love that?

57:20.578 --> 57:20.678
Yeah.

57:20.698 --> 57:23.341
Richard Ford answers, it's about 432 pages.

57:25.183 --> 57:27.024
I don't mind at all.

57:27.144 --> 57:31.388
I mean, I like this—they get a kind of weird look, but I say, well, what kind of books do you write?

57:31.469 --> 57:36.253
And I say, well, the first one was about this guy who went out to buy his shoelaces on his lunch hour.

57:36.892 --> 57:45.563
So I was going to kind of look around and, oh, interesting, thinking, well, it's fine.

57:45.583 --> 57:47.805
I get involved when I was writing General Madness.

57:47.825 --> 57:49.027
I said, this is Miami.

57:49.047 --> 57:51.670
I was at the book fair down there last year.

57:52.591 --> 57:55.555
My old pal Bill Robinson from the Miami Herald was out there.

57:55.575 --> 57:59.760
We used to hang out and drink, you know, in New York.

58:00.466 --> 58:03.418
My friend Bill Robinson here, he'd say, what's your book about?

58:03.458 --> 58:04.783
I said, well, it's about book collectors.

58:04.824 --> 58:07.193
And I said, and Bill was as guilty as the next guy.

58:07.213 --> 58:08.940
I said, I get this blank, vacant look.

58:09.173 --> 58:14.838
And then he came up to me after and he says, Nick, he says, the reason you get the plane for it is we were both drunk.

58:15.439 --> 58:22.566
He says, it wasn't because I wasn't comprehending what the book was about because I think we were drunk.

58:23.266 --> 58:24.848
He says, when you told me.

58:24.868 --> 58:25.469
Funny story.

58:25.489 --> 58:27.390
But I mean people say, what's this book about?

58:27.430 --> 58:31.694
And I say, well, it's about book culture, you know, it's about libraries.

58:32.355 --> 58:35.138
Well that's kind of interesting, you know, they say.

58:35.158 --> 58:37.560
Well that's a good way to say it.

58:38.047 --> 58:39.889
It's not a millennial thing, but it is.

58:39.909 --> 58:42.231
I'm not going to have millennium in the subtitle.

58:42.251 --> 58:43.532
That's the kiss of death, I think.

58:45.454 --> 58:48.397
I've changed the title three times.

58:48.417 --> 58:50.599
That's a very good question.

58:51.901 --> 58:57.706
Penelope Fitzgerald, she said she can't start writing, and she's strictly a pen and ink writer.

58:58.907 --> 59:04.133
And she said, I can't write until I have the first paragraph and the last paragraph and the title.

59:04.173 --> 59:05.674
She said, they always change my titles.

59:06.025 --> 59:09.549
But for me, I have to have all of these things.

59:10.330 --> 59:18.259
And then I said, well, gee, that's really quite an acknowledgment because you've written nine novels and only one has what could be described as a happy ending.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.122
And she said, well, I take my cues from life.

59:23.505 --> 59:29.051
But I guess yourself, do you kind of know the arc of the novel?

59:29.111 --> 59:34.277
Well, more so in the case of the earlier books, because I knew, say, with the mezzanine,

59:34.477 --> 59:41.526
I had all this stuff saved up that I'd been harboring for years that I wanted to put in one book.

59:42.928 --> 59:52.500
But with The Everlasting Story of Nori, I had no idea how the book was going to turn out because I was writing it day to day based on reports I was getting from the field.

59:52.761 --> 59:53.922
That's great.

59:54.403 --> 59:56.906
So I didn't know if it was going to have a happy ending or not.

59:56.926 --> 59:59.570
So this was quite literally a work in progress, wasn't it?

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:04.416
Yeah, and I was hoping that things would end all right.

01:00:04.919 --> 01:00:18.439
And I mean, I had to make a few adjustments based on the fact that the characters don't exactly correspond to characters in real life.

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:32.800
But I was kind of crossing my fingers that life would turn out all right, so that my book would have some kind of an ending.

01:00:34.383 --> 01:00:52.980
And I loved that feeling of, you know, skateboarding almost, through the giving, working, winding my way around whatever obstructions and park benches would come in my way.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:57.644
You know, the feeling that you're feeling your way through something without knowing what's going to be next.

01:00:57.725 --> 01:00:58.505
Did you have your title?

01:00:59.526 --> 01:01:03.630
Well, the title, the title is also the riskiest title, I think, because

01:01:04.555 --> 01:01:11.942
Because the everlasting story of Nori is just a strange-sounding thing.

01:01:11.962 --> 01:01:20.010
But it's true, I think, to a nine-year-old mind.

01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:34.545
The words like everlasting and forevermore and never-ending have a kind of power over this girl in the book.

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:48.068
And she very much wants her heroines to have these lives, these heroic lives, and all these adventures.

01:01:48.149 --> 01:02:00.769
But of course she herself is having a fairly unadventurous life, going to school, studying, learning about classics, you know.

01:02:03.247 --> 01:02:05.329
So there's that part of the title.

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:23.910
But the part that appealed to me maybe was the kind of sadness in it that every parent feels, that they love the self that their child is going to develop into, even in advance.

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:33.000
I mean, I love the nine-year-old self that has annihilated the four-year-old self in my life.

01:02:33.318 --> 01:02:34.500
daughter.

01:02:34.801 --> 01:02:46.963
But all these series of cells that is a person developing are fleeting.

01:02:46.983 --> 01:02:50.770
They are very short-lived.
