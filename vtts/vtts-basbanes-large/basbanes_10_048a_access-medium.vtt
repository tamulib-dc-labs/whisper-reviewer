WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:20.233
from the program in creative writing.

00:21.655 --> 00:30.004
What you've been looking at besides a lot of sort of mad tech recovery

00:30.423 --> 00:38.474
And then when we've been up and running, some of the pieces done by former students here at Brown University.

00:39.295 --> 00:43.562
It works completely, quite marvelous works, like hundreds of them.

00:43.662 --> 00:47.727
We've been showing just a handful.

00:47.747 --> 00:52.554
We had Sean Sullivan's and Dr. Rezina up there with those links.

00:52.594 --> 00:58.843
We had Mary Kim Marnell's Lustup and Alvin Luce, Bobby Doubleday, and

00:59.937 --> 01:06.363
The thing that brought the machine down was a beautiful director-driven poem, Spy Versus Five.

01:06.383 --> 01:12.969
His and Alex Gore is completed in a workshop in the Multimedia Lab.

01:13.489 --> 01:28.543
And the piece by Mary Kim, of course, was published by Eastgate, as was another piece we had up, which was Shelley Jackson's Patchwork Girl, a lovely work which plays with the Frankenstein theme.

01:30.548 --> 01:43.624
And what we're hoping to hear at any moment is Mark, America's Grammatron, which was completed as his MFA thesis here.

01:44.405 --> 01:49.852
He'd hoped to be with us tonight, but he's on tour with other electronic artists in Australia.

01:50.373 --> 01:57.581
But in email I just got yesterday, he writes, the Wednesday night program looks simple.

01:58.022 --> 01:59.644
Thanks for showing Grammatron.

02:00.097 --> 02:08.928
Had it not been for the Creative Writing Fellowship, it would never have materialized, and I'm ever grateful for having had the support of Brown to finish.

02:08.948 --> 02:13.514
It's great for staging this in the best of all possible venues.

02:14.015 --> 02:22.746
Anyway, now here to welcome us to this best of all possible venues is the Brown University Provost and himself, our Brown alumnus, William Simmons.

02:33.003 --> 02:35.445
Welcome to the beautiful Brown campus.

02:35.565 --> 02:46.675
We timed it so that all of our trees and flowers would be budding and all the snow would be melting and the sun would be shining for your arrival.

02:46.695 --> 03:02.149
And just as a kind of a quick tribute to the Brown campus that I have to take this opportunity to mention, I'm somewhat struck by the symmetry where if you go in that direction 150 yards,

03:02.922 --> 03:27.378
you come to the largest, I think the largest repository in all of North America, the oldest North American literature in the John Carter-run library, and then you go from there 150 yards in this direction, and you've got the absolutely state-of-the-art throwing a grappling hook to the future discussion of where literature is going in North America.

03:28.039 --> 03:29.922
So we've got 150 yards of each other.

03:29.942 --> 03:32.085
We have them both here in the Brown campus.

03:33.027 --> 03:38.252
So welcome to Technology, Platforms, and 21st Century Literature.

03:39.734 --> 03:45.680
I've done some homework in preparing for this introduction, so I hope you will Bible me as I read.

03:50.284 --> 04:02.376
Tonight's show, which opens the three-day conference, will present an exciting display of the newest hypermedia literary works featuring nearly a dozen of the nation's most important electronic fiction writers and poets.

04:02.930 --> 04:05.973
of this decade, which is to say of all time.

04:06.193 --> 04:08.316
It's that new and that powerful.

04:08.616 --> 04:12.480
It's the medium of the moment and surely of the next decades to come.

04:14.302 --> 04:21.410
But it is also a restlessly developing and still unstable medium, which until now has paid scant attention to literature.

04:22.431 --> 04:27.757
Also present, therefore, are some of the most gifted and innovative technical developers in the country.

04:28.658 --> 04:32.802
The purpose of this week's conference being to bring together writers and technologists

04:33.406 --> 04:43.238
in a search for ways to make the computer as conducive to serious literature, whatever it might look like in the future, as the print medium has been in the past.

04:45.541 --> 04:56.494
The poet Stephanie Strickland, present and performing this evening, offered a paragraph that summed up so eloquently what we are hoping to achieve here at this conference, and here I quote,

04:57.014 --> 05:06.823
My goal is to find what combination of modalities will really support text in the new environment so that text does not get reduced to caption.

05:08.365 --> 05:24.540
Text important enough to hold its own on a multimedia world, text presented effectively enough that someone in the midst of the present web speed culture actually finds an individualized, meditated space of the kind that supports mental doodling, rest,

05:24.942 --> 05:28.647
quiet exploration in a safe space as book school wanted to do.

05:30.289 --> 05:38.160
This encounter could only happen at Brown University, a world leader in developing humanistic uses of the computer for over three decades.

05:39.282 --> 05:50.697
This conference is sponsored by the Brown University Scholarly Technology Group and Multimedia Lab, the Hyperfiction Workshops of the Program in Creative Writing,

05:51.166 --> 05:51.947
and by U.S.

05:52.027 --> 05:56.113
Web, SoftBank, Ziff Davis, and the Internet Capital Group.

05:56.133 --> 06:07.067
Scores of other institutions, businesses, publishing houses, and computer companies have sent representatives as well, and all are welcome to join in the dialogue of the next two days.

06:15.859 --> 06:19.924
I would like to say a word of tribute to our conference planner,

06:20.360 --> 06:28.190
hyperfiction workshop teacher, and Brown faculty member, Robert Cooper, of whom we are all proud.

06:28.670 --> 06:38.482
And here I quote a passage.

06:38.502 --> 06:42.267
Here I quote a passage from his own fingers.

06:43.548 --> 06:49.776
Until now, the attention of software developers has been on making things faster and flashier for the commercial world

06:50.465 --> 06:54.932
And in the process, text, and particularly literary text, has taken something of a beating.

06:55.993 --> 06:59.619
We want to focus that attention for a moment on the needs of creative writers.

07:00.320 --> 07:05.407
As the world moves from book to screen, we don't want to leave serious literature in the backwaters.

07:11.256 --> 07:15.763
Robert Nadellano, English Fellow here at Brown University, wrote,

07:21.498 --> 07:34.815
wrote a professor Cooper since the publication three decades ago of his first collection of stories, Robert Cooper's prose has consistently demonstrated a marked skepticism toward linear narrative conventions in fiction.

07:35.896 --> 07:42.144
Beginning with early mainframe experiments processing chapters on punch cards, do you remember those?

07:42.825 --> 07:51.235
I just came from the University of California at Berkeley to Brown five months ago and I would say that one out of every ten rooms at Berkeley has boxes of punch cards

07:52.328 --> 08:00.681
Beginning with early mainframe experiments processing chapters on punch cards, Cougar's computer literature projects tampering with the tyranny of the line.

08:02.464 --> 08:10.877
Cougar's computer projects tampering with the tyranny of the line continue through his development of Brown's groundbreaking hypertext fiction workshop.

08:15.544 --> 08:18.268
I would also like in closing to draw your attention

08:18.738 --> 08:34.601
to a wonderful interview with Professor Kuber by Rebecca Doerr in this week's edition of the Providence Phoenix, a little local newspaper that you can find in newsstands almost anywhere here around the east side.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.547
Words off the page, Robert Kuber is reading Literary Revolution.

08:39.007 --> 08:41.631
Let us use pen and paper for keyboard and mouse.

08:42.372 --> 08:44.175
And I'll just read one brief paragraph.

08:44.876 --> 08:48.441
The interaction between computers and literature is only 30 years old.

08:48.843 --> 08:54.329
and it is still unclear exactly how the interaction might affect the way that we read stories.

08:55.210 --> 09:14.973
With Robert Cooper at the helm, Brown University will reaffirm its place as a leader in electronic writing by hosting TP21CL, technology platforms for 20th century literature, a monumental exchange between techies and writers happening from April 7th to 9th.

09:15.994 --> 09:16.875
So here we are,

09:17.311 --> 09:26.584
Thanks to Bob Coover, and welcome all of you to Brown.

09:28.746 --> 09:29.027
Thanks.

09:29.868 --> 09:31.430
Thanks, Rebecca.

09:31.470 --> 09:34.975
I was a student and a current student of Hypertext Writers.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.899
He's in the Advanced Electronic Composition course.

09:38.580 --> 09:46.170
This conference is about writers and about serious literature and its survival and its enhancement in this powerful

09:46.437 --> 09:47.558
new medium of the computer.

09:47.578 --> 09:52.305
So it seemed essential that we begin the whole three-day event with the writers themselves.

09:53.246 --> 10:01.837
So I want to show you what's happening right now in the world of electronic fiction, writing, and poetry.

10:01.857 --> 10:08.125
I'm assisted by our own Bobby Arellano, also known on the net as Bobby Rabbit.

10:09.134 --> 10:16.722
He was the first writer to graduate from our MFA program with an all-electronic thesis and is now a valuable teacher in our hypertext and workshops.

10:17.242 --> 10:22.248
You just had a glimpse there of his online interactive novel, Sunshine 69.

10:23.009 --> 10:32.198
The first, if it's kind, we hope to get a chance to see more of it before the evening's done, though we've begun a bit late with all of the technical.

10:32.218 --> 10:36.863
One thing that's just been happening has been online hypertext contrast.

10:37.248 --> 10:40.112
run by Mark America's Altex site.

10:40.212 --> 10:43.796
We visited earlier to get a glimpse of his Grammatron in collaboration with me.

10:44.277 --> 10:53.148
This contest is in collaboration with a trace group at a university in Nottingham, England, with a first prize of a thousand pounds or something just under $1,700.

10:54.009 --> 11:06.225
The winners and finalists announced just this week several of the finalists are in fact here, including Rob Whittig, whose project marks the you're now looking at on the screen.

11:07.808 --> 11:16.317
And also, I think, both Mary Kim Arnold and Matt Derby, I believe, are here.

11:16.337 --> 11:22.924
They collaborated on Kokura, the moving and eloquent hyperfiction, centering quite literally on the atom bomb.

11:23.505 --> 11:34.557
There are three hypertexts running concurrently, one from the viewpoint of the woman, one from the atom man, and one about the making of the bomb.

11:35.038 --> 11:37.360
This one on the making of the bomb.

11:37.880 --> 11:45.051
with a frame at the top that automatically refreshes every five seconds, ticking off the actual bomb tests.

11:45.652 --> 11:54.465
Mary Kim is teaching at Brown this semester as an adjunct lecturer in fiction, and Matt is graduating the MFA program with a partially electronic thesis.

11:55.467 --> 11:57.149
There were two co-winners of the contest.

11:57.910 --> 12:06.283
One of them, an Australian poet named Jenny Waite, whose hyper-poem Rice we hoped to show, but we weren't able to bring shockwaves

12:06.652 --> 12:08.034
on this system.

12:08.174 --> 12:15.082
It's a beautiful hypertext with, we should be now listening to music playing on top of this.

12:15.543 --> 12:30.280
Each of these links to another kind of hypertext document in which much of what's happening is in fact run on Shockwave, which needs a computer a little bit more upgraded than this one.

12:31.390 --> 12:36.975
It's very fancy, very beautiful, because you get lots of media flagged at once.

12:36.995 --> 12:46.925
You can have music playing, and you can have hypertext links at the same time you have information going, and in general, in the text itself can be animated.

12:47.565 --> 12:51.749
So the potential of it is enormous.

12:52.570 --> 12:59.777
In fact, in this case, she uses all of those things, music, voiceover, variety of software applications

13:00.297 --> 13:08.064
as part of a, so to speak, hypertextual grammar to invoke the scenes, past and present.

13:08.084 --> 13:19.494
But beautiful as it is as an electronic poetry project, Rice's use of hypertext is actually quite minimal, being employed mainly as a back and forth link between whole objects.

13:20.275 --> 13:28.903
And this move, encouraged by the way the internet and the HTML presently work, is troubling some hypertextures.

13:29.373 --> 13:35.361
In the discussion on our website leading up to this conference, I've detected, are you ready for this?

13:36.643 --> 13:44.913
A kind of lament for the golden age of hypertext, which perhaps has already passed us by.

13:47.977 --> 13:55.988
But classic hypertext is still alive and well, as evidenced by the Altex trace co-winner, the unknown.

13:56.491 --> 14:05.019
a collaborative fiction about the imagined adventures of three supposedly rich and famous writers on a mock book tour all over the world.

14:05.519 --> 14:12.445
Genuinely multi-sequential and massively rich in story material, written by three friends, all of whom are here with us tonight.

14:12.966 --> 14:24.456
And so, that book tour of Ayers continues, for here to launch our night of readings with a multi-vocal as well as multimedia performance are its authors William Gillespie, Scott Redbird, and Dirk Stratton.

14:40.147 --> 14:47.415
All right, here's the clicker.

14:47.455 --> 14:48.857
Thank you very much.

14:49.378 --> 14:52.641
Especially thanks to Robert Cooper for bringing us here tonight.

14:53.783 --> 15:00.290
This is really a silly dream come true for us.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.635
The Unknown is a collaborative hypertext novel.

15:05.189 --> 15:13.638
For us as writers, this project began as a conscious exploration of two modes of writing which we didn't understand, hypertext and collaboration.

15:14.699 --> 15:32.817
Our initial intention was to promote a print anthology of what we consider our best fiction, prose, poetry, and drama by telling the story of a book tour we would go on in support of the then non-existent manuscript.

15:33.218 --> 15:35.943
From motion before dignity.

15:37.926 --> 15:41.872
Content preceded structure, which initially evolved organically.

15:42.493 --> 15:45.538
As we created text, however, we realized two things.

15:45.559 --> 15:50.467
A, that hypertext is necessarily phonetic, a story that the reader thrives.

15:50.487 --> 15:59.682
And B, that we were generating different kinds of material and that some taxonomy was necessary to help readers navigate through our hypertext novel.

16:00.640 --> 16:09.871
To this end, we adopted a metaphor from the Chicago Transit Authority subway map and placed the material on differently colored lines.

16:10.312 --> 16:16.760
The red line is a sickeningly decadent publicity-driven hypertext novel that describes the aforementioned book tour.

16:20.705 --> 16:24.049
The purple line is metafictional bullshit.

16:24.383 --> 16:27.727
which hypertext almost inevitably engenders.

16:28.207 --> 16:34.054
The blue line is a collection of documentary materials about our real life adventures.

16:34.895 --> 16:41.703
The orange line is a collection of correspondence between the unknown and others written over a long period of time.

16:42.644 --> 16:49.412
The brown line is a collection of related image equal text projects, including Katie Gilligan's watercolor diary.

16:50.337 --> 17:00.428
The green line is a place where readers can find interactive live readings of the unknown in real audio, including this one after we're done with it.

17:01.369 --> 17:13.663
Because the essence of hypertext is a collaboration between the reader navigator and the authors, in addition to the in-text hyperlinks and the just described lines, we elected to include three other modes of navigation.

17:14.704 --> 17:19.129
An image map of locations in the United States we visited on our

17:19.396 --> 17:30.913
alleged book tour, a list of independent bookstores where we gave readings on our book tour, and a list of people who appear as characters in The Unknown.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.641
We're going to do a short reading.

17:36.702 --> 17:37.903
We only have time for two pages.

17:38.384 --> 17:41.409
And if there are any publishers in the audience, we've got a manuscript to show you.

17:43.311 --> 17:49.200
We're loading the first page that we wrote.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.583
one evening in Cincinnati, The Unknown.

17:54.004 --> 17:56.306
Everybody gets told to write about what they know.

17:56.947 --> 18:01.952
The trouble with many of us is that at the earlier stages of life, we think we know everything.

18:02.432 --> 18:08.017
Or to put it more usefully, we are often unaware of the scope and structure of our ignorance.

18:08.037 --> 18:11.280
Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.422
It has contours and coherence.

18:13.823 --> 18:16.165
And for all I know, rules of operation as well.

18:16.665 --> 18:17.466
Thomas Pynchon.

18:17.834 --> 18:20.236
When you get right down to it, it's all sublime.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.958
That is indescribable.

18:22.398 --> 18:23.419
You don't stop, though.

18:23.439 --> 18:24.660
You keep trying to describe it.

18:25.201 --> 18:27.563
Language games become a form of breathing.

18:28.544 --> 18:37.192
What you don't know can and will hurt you, but not as much as will what you already know, which already has and will continue to bring you pain.

18:37.953 --> 18:40.375
This is also the ultimate cause of joy.

18:40.916 --> 18:45.580
To what extent is the unknown a function of memory, and to what extent fate?

18:46.724 --> 18:49.128
We are frontier obsessive creatures.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.852
From America, could we be otherwise?

18:52.653 --> 18:56.319
This is not all the stuff of domination, one would hope.

18:56.899 --> 18:58.582
To know what is not known.

18:59.083 --> 19:03.730
That is the limit and the expanse and the infinite undoing of all horizons.

19:04.731 --> 19:09.859
But how can we explore the spaces between understandings of things?

19:09.879 --> 19:13.845
How can we begin to question how we remember, not what we remember?

19:14.821 --> 19:18.047
How can we know the totality of what we do not think?

19:18.929 --> 19:20.512
There is a problem of scale.

19:20.973 --> 19:21.895
To discuss U.S.

19:21.915 --> 19:25.923
foreign policy is to avoid discussion of the fact that we are sitting at a table.

19:26.324 --> 19:27.747
There is a problem of etiquette.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.054
That is, in addition to the unknown, there is the undiscussed.

19:31.074 --> 19:36.745
And we are sitting at a table, but that fact is not very interesting to us right now.

19:39.880 --> 19:54.300
Brown was paying us $10,000 and giving us a very large auditorium with a state-of-the-art overhead projector mac with a T1 internet connection so we could read our hypertext live from the net.

19:54.801 --> 19:58.987
They were stocking their bookstores with our books and large color posters of us.

19:59.608 --> 20:07.339
Cooper was making the reading required for his students in hypertext 301, spaces in practice.

20:07.910 --> 20:23.488
When we got to Providence, though, extraordinarily exhausted from three days of solid 70-plus MPH, a call from Marla on the cellular informed us that the gig at Brown had been canceled because the auditorium had been requested at the last minute by the Kronos Quartet.

20:23.468 --> 20:37.006
Congress have been delighting and outraging their fans this tour by performing the album Red Zeppelin Tune straight through as arranged for string quartet, therapy, water drums, and a variety of original microtonal instruments built by Harry Clark.

20:37.947 --> 20:40.270
But Brown was paying us anyway.

20:40.290 --> 20:46.759
So after our under-attended, even for us, reading at Books on the Square, there was nobody from Brown to greet the unknown in Providence.

20:47.077 --> 20:53.146
sleep deprived, our discouragement tainted with relief, we had nothing to do for the rest of the day but drink.

20:53.266 --> 21:07.648
So we went from the bookstore to the bar across the street, the Leary Dale House, and the four of us, me, Scott, Frank, and William, settled in at the table by the jukebox, which played only gay with music, with an ash tray of pretzels and four pints of a frothy Welsh beer named Schluz.

21:10.252 --> 21:16.341
There was an old man at the bar and a man in a suit playing darts alone in a cozy sense that if time passed here,

21:16.642 --> 21:17.983
It passed by outside.

21:18.784 --> 21:23.149
We each began reading a scene for the unknown hypertext 2, the time machine.

21:23.770 --> 21:28.414
The next day we would have an argument which would lead us to rejecting the time machine idea.

21:29.876 --> 21:41.248
Scott, on the snappy laptop Marla had bought him for his 30th birthday, began typing his proposal, none of us ever knew if he was serious, for a cable station called WTV, Writer Television.

21:41.684 --> 21:52.059
WTV would feature lavishly produced text videos in which young poets lip sync their writing in solid, image-processed dramas involving sexy models and sports cars.

21:52.720 --> 21:58.908
WTV also featured closet case classics, videos of old writing, like readings by Allen Ginsberg.

21:59.730 --> 22:02.173
WTV also featured feature-length movies.

22:02.390 --> 22:12.279
such as the powerful biography of Gertrude Stein, Oliver Stone's Stein, or Gus Van Tenen's Infinite Jest.

22:12.299 --> 22:15.482
Videos would be introduced by charming young people in designer clothing.

22:15.622 --> 22:27.854
There would be concert movies, and literature would be reconciled with the mainstream in a way that would keep the mainstream fond of literature while literature continued to be alienated from and wary of the mainstream.

22:28.855 --> 22:32.278
William continued working on the unknown crossword puzzle

22:32.782 --> 22:38.969
It was a poetry project based on a list of 100 constraints which operated simultaneously across two languages.

22:38.989 --> 22:45.155
He had to learn French and C++ to search the OED online to find the word.

22:45.796 --> 22:47.317
He had been working on it for a year.

22:48.058 --> 22:51.762
Nobody else really approved of the project, but they knew better than to criticize it.

22:52.102 --> 22:53.484
And the moon in O'Leary's was good.

22:54.004 --> 23:01.152
In that dank warmth, the idea of a crossword puzzle written in Alexandrine's without the letter E or five letter words made sense.

23:01.638 --> 23:03.361
It was even worthy of a toast or three.

23:04.683 --> 23:11.175
Frank wrote a scene about how, around the year 2010, The Unknown had a reunion concert at Carnegie Hall.

23:11.716 --> 23:17.266
A lot of our old fans and friends had paid a hundred bucks a ticket, and there was a certain tension.

23:18.207 --> 23:20.531
Our old fans weren't crazy about our newer stuff.

23:20.852 --> 23:25.941
We were reading our latest hypertext novel, Suburb of the Young Young.

23:26.208 --> 23:32.714
about how four writers named Scott, Frank, Dirk, and William all got married and moved into a gated community together.

23:33.515 --> 23:36.017
Half the crowd was trying to boo us off the stage.

23:36.658 --> 23:49.490
They didn't properly appreciate the depth of the scene with Frank in AA, nor the scene with Scott borrowing Dirk's lawnmower, nor the scene with William pushing his daughter on the swing set, telling her about belt insurance.

23:51.152 --> 23:55.776
I was writing about Unknown Palooza, the Unknown's outdoor rock concert,

23:56.009 --> 23:58.994
We gave seven readings and between them different bands would play.

23:59.515 --> 24:03.783
It was weird because we were the oldest people there and we had never heard of any of the bands.

24:04.283 --> 24:09.613
But the kids loved us and by the end of the concert I had dreadlocks and Scott had a nose ring and a pierced lip.

24:10.234 --> 24:21.173
William wanted to get a tattoo of William Gaddis on his back but the tattoo artist, who claimed to be able to do any tattoo, had never heard of William Gaddis and was apologetic but ultimately uninterested.

24:21.457 --> 24:27.404
We were all writing and chuckling and drinking and eating pretzels when a man in the suit stopped playing darts and pulled up a chair at our table.

24:27.804 --> 24:29.486
He had recognized us.

24:29.506 --> 24:32.269
He introduced himself as John Tormade III.

24:32.730 --> 24:41.299
He was an entertainment, art, and media lawyer who handled transactional matters as well as certain claims and litigation matters as they pertained to the entertainment business.

24:41.319 --> 24:47.987
He told us about his Martindale Hubbard lawyers rating as well as his timely and responsive representation of his clients.

24:48.372 --> 24:51.762
He has studied at Harvard and the UCLA School of Law.

24:52.684 --> 24:54.169
We were all very impressed.

24:54.189 --> 25:00.507
We had a certain detached admiration for those who had gone to college in order to obtain marketable skills.

25:00.527 --> 25:03.816
There ensued much back slapping and handshaking and round buying.

25:04.049 --> 25:07.854
Torvey told us stories about U2, Negative Land, and Casey Kasem.

25:08.315 --> 25:09.937
We told them about Krass Mueller.

25:10.578 --> 25:15.325
Just by way of fucking with the man, Frank posed an interesting hypothetical legal case.

25:15.525 --> 25:22.294
Say a man has been, using email, helping to write a hypertext novel, and has been given little in the way of editorial power.

25:22.314 --> 25:33.870
Say that the man no longer wants to write the hypertext novel, and wants all his writing excised for the novel so that he might publish these themes elsewhere, or incorporate them into different print novels composed by himself alone.

25:34.272 --> 25:40.138
Then there ensues disagreement between the four or more collaborating authors as to which of the various parties actually wrote what?

25:40.559 --> 25:46.585
Because many of the scenes were written together, or written by one person and edited by another, and proofread by someone else.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.749
Some were written under the influence, or over telnet.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.291
The disagreements are very complicated indeed.

25:52.632 --> 26:01.281
Say, for example, that there is a very heated argument over whose property is the soft-core porn art poem, still life with my pecker, or someone's always fucking with my mirror.

26:01.762 --> 26:02.963
Say the man hires you.

26:03.314 --> 26:04.476
How do you proceed?

26:05.357 --> 26:12.828
But we never got to hear his opinion, because at that point, Robert Cooper, the Kronos Quartet, and the gaggle of ground faculty entered the bar.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.452
Carol Mesa was buying everyone drinks.

26:16.134 --> 26:19.579
Gail Nelson winked at us and put a $5 bill into the jukebox.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.064
William ran over and hugged his friend, Rishi, who came to sit with us.

26:24.186 --> 26:32.258
It looked like we might get to have fun in Providence after all.

26:36.372 --> 26:48.905
Tomorrow night when there's a sort of informal thing, we're going to try and do an interactive reading of the unknown where we'll ring a bell and everyone in the audience can choose where to go next.

26:49.406 --> 26:54.611
A little abbreviated here, but if you like it, come back for more tomorrow night.

26:54.631 --> 26:55.693
Thanks a lot.

26:55.713 --> 27:02.700
And we also have copies of our anthology for anyone who still likes books.

27:06.713 --> 27:34.527
The proliferation of online magazines and contests, that one is stimulating an explosion really of creative electronic compositions.

27:35.468 --> 27:41.817
But behind all this hyperactivity lies the work of a few early pioneers, not least our next writer, Michael Joyce.

27:42.538 --> 28:01.305
Michael's groundbreaking hyperfiction, Afternoon, written in Story Space, which he himself helped to create, has in one short decade moved from being a radical underground experiment known only to a coterie of hypertext adepts to the status of a classic.

28:02.227 --> 28:03.248
Its famous line,

28:04.173 --> 28:26.991
there is no simple way to say this has become the title of our writer's symposium tomorrow morning in the piano lounge since afternoon's publication a mere decade ago Michael has gone on to write a variety of multimedia hyper fictions including Twilight a Symphony and the online 12 blue which you're looking at now

28:28.692 --> 28:35.284
Not to mention a new work in progress, an island piece demoed last fall at the University of South Carolina's Hyper Halloween.

28:35.304 --> 28:51.635
Tonight, he'll be reading from his newest completed work on the birthday of The Stranger, which has just been published this past month by the new online version of Evergreen Review, that great Vanguard print magazine of the 1960s and 1970s.

28:51.715 --> 28:52.236
Michael Jones.

29:04.450 --> 29:07.934
Thank you.

29:09.056 --> 29:30.002
This work is dedicated to the memory of John Hawkes, and this gives me an opportunity for those of you in the Brown community, or indeed any of you in the Northeast who have been driving distance, to suggest that you think about coming next week on the 13th and 14th, when this university will celebrate the memory of the passion of the great artist John Hawkes.

29:30.809 --> 29:50.141
I have less called John Huck's memory than almost anyone on earth, but I can say that at a certain time in my life, when I came to the University of Iowa, he told me that my writing was energized language, and that the way would be difficult, that I'd have to hold on, that he saved my writing life, and thus my life.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.507
And I honor his memory.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.053
Internet-wise, I want to take a minute also to say

29:58.771 --> 30:00.934
Thomas Simmons talked about symmetries.

30:01.435 --> 30:10.548
And I have this little sheet of paper here, much smaller because I use computers, that says, only Brown, only Cougar, energetic language.

30:11.770 --> 30:23.126
I do want to add my voice, and say that it takes a magnificent artist, a very brave person, to do what Robert Cougar has done.

30:23.707 --> 30:26.871
But Bob is championed and moves forward a literature

30:27.104 --> 30:48.153
I was fortunate enough to be in this room eight years ago at the Second Unspeakable Practices meeting conference.

30:48.193 --> 30:49.855
When Bob Cougar stood here

30:50.375 --> 30:56.984
and said to basically assembled avant-garde writers in America, it's time to look at electronic writing.

30:57.004 --> 30:58.326
It's time to join our voices.

30:59.007 --> 31:05.496
Only Bob Duber can convene that kind of joined minds, the kind of minds that we're joining this week.

31:06.197 --> 31:17.412
Only Brown is the center, and I say this as a University of Iowa workshop graduate, and I have somebody who apparently loves the work that I do at Vassar, but only Brown can convene us

31:17.830 --> 31:21.075
around this new culture, and I'm pleased to be here.

31:21.095 --> 31:23.718
And I do want to say that it's not avant-garde writing.

31:23.738 --> 31:25.080
It's not experimental writing.

31:25.141 --> 31:26.823
It is, indeed, energized language.

31:27.143 --> 31:30.308
And the computer is literally energized, energized by the computer.

31:30.328 --> 31:35.435
But it is at one piece, and we join ourselves with the memory of a number of artists going forth.

31:35.636 --> 31:37.979
I'll shut up and read a little bit.

31:38.099 --> 31:47.753
I bet Fabioreano, who played the part of the reader, will say briefly that in On the Birth Table of Strangers, only

31:48.053 --> 31:50.836
The words at the bottom of the page have links from them.

31:51.436 --> 31:57.262
He set up, thinking there would be a slow disappearance of the things he considered overwhelming.

31:57.882 --> 32:04.208
But by the time evening arrived, everyone had forgotten what the music meant.

32:07.291 --> 32:08.052
Second interview.

32:08.812 --> 32:13.217
Later she appears without the camera crew, holding only a wire-bound spiral center book.

32:13.877 --> 32:15.178
Do you have a twin, he asks.

32:15.639 --> 32:16.980
Don't be absurd, she laughs.

32:17.332 --> 32:18.473
This is a small country.

32:19.455 --> 32:21.217
Do you take shorthand, he asks.

32:21.237 --> 32:22.659
I have my own system, she says.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.683
May a person get a question in edgewise?

32:25.703 --> 32:27.044
Should I answer that question?

32:27.165 --> 32:38.519
Cat creeping through the melting snow and mulch where, lower on the slope, beyond the fence, hidden in the backyard of the convent, secret snowdrops are in full bloom.

32:42.004 --> 32:43.085
Midnight.

32:43.105 --> 32:46.950
It was his habit to treat the last hour of any birthday as an oracular occasion.

32:47.285 --> 32:53.592
his belief being that his mood or activities at that time augured the prevailing mood or unfolding of events for the coming year.

32:53.652 --> 32:55.895
Thus, as best he could, he would record.

32:55.935 --> 33:05.766
There is a poem of Walt Whitman's in which a woman watches bathers at a distance from a window of her house, young men in the waves.

33:07.008 --> 33:13.495
Whitman turns the thing into a hollowed mirror as the unseen woman's gaze lingers over the limbs and shoulders of the young men.

33:13.745 --> 33:20.535
but it is this most homoerotic and manly of poets who tells us this, whose own eyes linger and gaze.

33:21.136 --> 33:27.606
Distant eros is what language is, and it resists fixation, whether in gender, location, voice, or embodiment.

33:27.927 --> 33:34.076
We are left only with a passing sense, notching occasions like a calendar kept on a stick.

33:34.096 --> 33:40.326
I remember once at a municipal auditorium seeing young boys bob and gamble in the crowded pool.

33:40.559 --> 33:49.212
They look like a jar of mixed pickles, a festive potpourri of cauliflower, cucumber, peppers, carrots, ripe as a circus poster or confetti.

33:49.253 --> 34:05.638
In my memory, the whole scene turns as unreal as a game in a video arcade, all the colors a little off in the way cheap artificial flowers blink with the vaguely metallic residue lingering in the dye, suspicious of closed perfections.

34:05.922 --> 34:14.655
preferring instead the full of days through which we see ourselves and so see ourselves through, though perhaps not where we thought we were going.

34:16.838 --> 34:17.279
History.

34:19.482 --> 34:25.872
Founded in such and such century long a trading center and then a rising merchant class in the first confederation civil war and the occupation

34:26.155 --> 34:40.970
by foreign powers, burnt and rebuilt, burnt again, rebuilt, moving from monarchy to representative assembly, then after it grew briefly governed by a central committee, long a strong hope of realism, then in this or that year took on romantic qualities in reaction to a new austerity, led to an experimental richness and ultimately an aleatory quality.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.952
A new life is an ironic realism.

34:43.613 --> 34:44.954
Can you imagine how boring it is?

34:44.974 --> 34:51.561
The interpreter put herself in other brandy and offered the containers to decline, to decline, pressing his fingers against his temples and rubbing them.

34:52.161 --> 34:53.503
At least you have a history.

34:53.523 --> 34:54.964
Things go back centuries here.

34:55.838 --> 35:01.847
Not so fast, my friend, the guide said, you Americans can no longer take refuge in your historical adolescence.

35:01.867 --> 35:07.296
The fortress of West Point is as much a castle as anything along the Rhine, and goes back centuries.

35:07.656 --> 35:12.924
The University of Virginia and Harvard College themselves now also partake of the centuries.

35:13.926 --> 35:24.462
The language inevitably running off the rails at some point, not quite vernacular despite his facility, with the branding his accent likewise coming back, there was no escaping history.

35:25.319 --> 35:35.832
In the face of an intimacy which rises like the waves of heat off the river under rain, the world seems given to us alone, liquid and insistent and constant.

35:35.852 --> 35:36.393
Interpretive.

35:38.375 --> 35:41.199
It wasn't clear to the man what he wished from him exactly.

35:41.659 --> 35:46.005
It was the case that almost everyone, even the toothless lunatics on the street, spoke English.

35:46.025 --> 35:47.466
The whole world now spoke English.

35:47.527 --> 35:48.368
It was the internet.

35:48.628 --> 35:50.150
The guy himself had a website.

35:51.251 --> 35:53.554
There are certain colorations, the client explained.

35:53.770 --> 35:55.732
Colorations was a good word, though, but flying.

35:56.933 --> 35:57.254
Flying.

35:59.736 --> 36:00.778
I love flying kites.

36:01.198 --> 36:05.703
We'd take the trolley to the beach, the thing bundled on our lap like a parachute or a holiday roast.

36:06.183 --> 36:10.488
Before long, there would be the first hang of salt and the changing light.

36:10.668 --> 36:19.778
Some new passengers, almost naked, a t-shirt, shorts, and a towel in this green bag, their bright swimsuit softly bulging and faded by the sea.

36:20.011 --> 36:26.099
He would squeeze my hand and I figured the packaged kite and the way lovers' hands bust over a belly or a shoulder.

36:26.820 --> 36:35.732
On the beach, I would unwrap the thing and hold it against the sand while he fitted the struts and tightened the strings until the shape of the thing emerged from the flattened sprawl of paper.

36:35.952 --> 36:42.441
Still holding it, although now like a wounded pup, I'd watch as he walked back along the line and pulled it taut, ready to run.

36:43.079 --> 36:49.108
He'd single and I'd let go and the thing would rise in an instant, spread back against the short breeze, splayed and flapping.

36:49.388 --> 36:50.429
It was like an orgasm.

36:50.930 --> 37:03.468
Before long I would take the cord into my hands and fly the thing, feeling the weight of it in my arms, doing so for hours, letting go only when he peeled my fingers from the reel and took the distance back up, dragging the sky down with the flapping creature.

37:04.730 --> 37:12.040
In the novel, a character imagined setting soap back upon the rubber nubs, thus struck by the ordinariness of certain objects which,

37:12.290 --> 37:14.173
could stand for the reality we share.

37:16.536 --> 37:19.341
Flowers.

37:19.361 --> 37:28.294
Flowers from a special type of apparatus, he supposed, outbought with non-ingenial usage and appropriation, really, sapping the natural world of its mystery.

37:28.695 --> 37:32.621
Still, it was no different, really, to represent them genetically, not generically.

37:33.762 --> 37:38.770
As bad to call them spring flowers and leave it at death, one ought to know local names for flowers of any region,

37:39.104 --> 37:44.452
Soapthroat and heart's nipple, butternut, the angel's tongue, rhodia ivory, umber rose.

37:45.573 --> 37:52.763
The flower that he situated in the buttonhole of his iron tweed suit was called Sweet Sicily, a favorite of the sheep of Al-Quran.

37:54.145 --> 37:58.732
My eye, the hand's other measure of surface and contour of meaning reflected upon you.

37:59.433 --> 38:04.420
You are standing near the garden watching the river waiting for someone, perhaps for me.

38:21.443 --> 38:31.761
Michael mentioned next week's event in honor of John Hawkes, and the posters will be up soon, and Sire's out for details about that, hoping they'll come.

38:32.242 --> 38:40.977
Of course, Jack himself would have been somewhat appalled, no doubt that he's so intimately linked to an electronic writing conference.

38:40.997 --> 38:42.540
He loathed even to my brother.

38:43.263 --> 38:47.709
Oh, Bob, your crying stuff means the end of literature.

38:50.794 --> 38:58.565
Michael was one of many early experimenters and experimenters over the past entire decade that created potential hypertext, of course.

38:59.486 --> 39:06.216
I'll cover up here with us at this symposium, including John McDade, who was the author of Uncle Buddy's Funhouse for a period of his thesis.

39:07.023 --> 39:18.897
There's Kathy Marshalls here, an innovative researcher at Poogee Xerox Palo Alto Laboratory and co-author with pioneer hyperfictionist Judy Malloy of Forward Anywhere.

39:18.917 --> 39:22.922
And we just, is that in the right order?

39:22.942 --> 39:24.123
We just set aside one way up too.

39:25.585 --> 39:31.292
We found the basements and no basements playing with us earlier as a division of voices.

39:31.762 --> 39:40.511
whose cyborg engineering the body electric is a landmark work of creative hyper non-fiction, another genre that's part of this conference.

39:41.011 --> 39:45.335
Both Kathy and Diane will be panelists at tomorrow morning's symposium.

39:46.136 --> 39:50.660
We'll hear from other early innovators tonight, not least from Stuart Molder.

39:50.681 --> 39:57.347
We'll conclude the program with exciting new work that is only he has seen as far as I know.

39:57.985 --> 40:15.180
But among those other early pioneers, the next reader will be Dean O'Lorsley, who not only has been writing creative hypertext for a decade now, but is also a major theorist and networker whose contributions to this gathering have already been substantial.

40:15.240 --> 40:21.726
She'll be reading from her newest work, Ferris Wheels, which helped kick off the brand new Iowa Review website.

40:21.746 --> 40:27.351
Now, we know this stuff is mainstream, but even the Iowa Review goes online.

40:28.192 --> 40:48.641
Paris Wheels and a lot of these works could not have happened without the help of all the writers and all of the ideas that have gotten through five or six or seven hypertext conferences.

40:48.721 --> 40:52.146
In fact, if we can turn the wheel.

40:57.233 --> 40:58.114
This wheel

40:59.174 --> 41:07.385
was based on something that Jim Rosenberg said, which was, if you could have a three-dimensional poem on one thing, how could you do that?

41:07.605 --> 41:07.906
Let's see.

41:08.687 --> 41:11.010
And what this is, is actually a poem.

41:12.432 --> 41:14.194
I would like some help with the technology.

41:14.995 --> 41:18.820
It goes too fast on the T1 line and too slow on 56K.

41:19.201 --> 41:25.349
Also, I don't know how to do an image map off an animated chip, so, you know, help me.

41:25.369 --> 41:25.890
But anyway,

41:26.225 --> 41:33.754
Ferris wheels, reach forever, reach falsehood, reach against tides, reach each other, and so forth we would think.

41:34.995 --> 41:41.683
The other thing with this is that each word in the poem is also the name of the nose in the story.

41:42.684 --> 41:50.153
So if we can enter the text, we will see the first part of the story and then I'll show you the nose.

41:52.075 --> 41:55.219
Ferris wheels, actually, what are we talking about?

41:57.730 --> 42:00.577
It's the taste of Colorado, and I have dragged you here.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.181
My yearly ritual.

42:03.144 --> 42:11.666
Denver opened summer with the proudest rock drumming craft booths of the People's Fair, and ended with these sticky, asphalt, cotton candy, carny crowds.

42:12.267 --> 42:13.731
We have escaped the notice.

42:14.909 --> 42:22.639
We had escaped the noise on the KBPI radio booth on Colfax, set up on the courthouse steps where I got my divorce about two years ago.

42:22.659 --> 42:29.828
A booth advertising bakalochi rose and green pepper salsa, purposely stepped where I stood and cried for four and a half hours.

42:30.689 --> 42:41.423
We wander around the raucous, overpriced food booths that are trampling the time and marvel that the intricate flower gardens between the courthouse and the capital are still intact.

42:41.622 --> 42:46.129
We passed in front of the shallow pool where I ran into you a little less than a year ago.

42:46.489 --> 42:54.341
I was watching the kids try to ride the blue grass dolphins, and you were biking wildly, trying to get out of the thrush of downtown cars and people.

42:54.942 --> 43:00.791
You thought you could take a shortcut to sort of park onto the flat sideways, but you missed the road as we collided.

43:01.171 --> 43:03.735
I knocked out your glass and recognized you from college.

43:04.316 --> 43:09.604
We forgot our other plans and went off to the Walnut Cafe for coffee and talked all night.

43:10.293 --> 43:12.256
Now, we've had too many days to count.

43:13.499 --> 43:18.988
You hold my hand and whisper in my ear, deftly avoiding the kid in the baggy pants and the skull-capped skateboard.

43:19.850 --> 43:23.576
You want the commitment, you say, your hand nuzzling under my hair.

43:23.636 --> 43:26.441
I shiver under the warmth of your fingers.

43:27.122 --> 43:29.066
Look, a Ferris wheel, I say.

43:29.707 --> 43:30.108
Let's go.

43:31.290 --> 43:35.457
And at this point, we can continue with the default line,

43:35.977 --> 43:41.647
or go up to still intact or cotton candy, or click anywhere on the Ferris wheel itself.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.971
Suggestions?

43:44.792 --> 43:49.641
Cotton candy, not candy.

43:50.482 --> 43:52.866
This is inter, which is again a part of the call.

43:54.409 --> 43:58.356
Ten dollars, which one's ticket, says the lady in her red page of Colorado t-shirt.

43:58.893 --> 44:08.922
A long drawing of the half-eaten watermelon slice on the front of her shirt almost matches the cotton candy she has in one hand, which is leaving spider strands of sugar all over the ticket.

44:09.663 --> 44:17.830
She is looking over at a bare-chested guy about six feet away, who is lovingly handling a thick boa, letting it flay over his squash boy buffaloes.

44:18.371 --> 44:20.172
She cranes her neck for a better view.

44:20.973 --> 44:26.258
We did not know how much the Ferris wheel cost, and asked her, God, buy tickets, she said.

44:26.278 --> 44:28.680
$10 for 20 tickets.

44:28.947 --> 44:34.233
We tell her we know this, but we just want to ride the Ferris wheel and want to know how many tickets we need.

44:34.814 --> 44:39.600
She shrugs her shoulder and brushes her neck as if she could feel the snake wriggling across her shoulders.

44:40.561 --> 44:44.726
I can't tell you what you need, she says, yet have to figure it out for yourselves.

44:46.047 --> 44:47.409
We decide to buy 20 tickets.

44:47.869 --> 44:51.093
If we don't need this many, you say, I will find a kid who wants them.

44:51.554 --> 44:58.482
A girl with tight ponytails and white shorts turned up at this pronouncement and looks like she is ready to follow us anywhere.

44:58.850 --> 45:04.539
I turn my head up to look at her, and she nods away, as though I had only seen her at the edges of my eyes.

45:05.200 --> 45:06.482
I hold your hand tightly.

45:07.123 --> 45:11.330
I always wanted tickets to ride when I was a kid, I say, and I reach for my money.

45:12.111 --> 45:13.033
My idea, I tell you.

45:13.674 --> 45:14.495
You pay anyway.

45:14.875 --> 45:15.557
You always do.

45:16.057 --> 45:17.179
It's the man's job, you say.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.283
I snuggle into your shoulder.

45:19.883 --> 45:20.625
We wait our turn.

45:21.626 --> 45:23.389
And we can go forwards, backwards.

45:24.247 --> 45:36.482
There are not that many people in the Ferris wheel line.

45:37.022 --> 45:39.025
You start counting the couples in the empty cars.

45:39.505 --> 45:41.007
We won't have very long to wait, you say.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.610
How do you know people will stay in couples, I ask?

45:44.491 --> 45:45.292
It's easy to say.

45:45.472 --> 45:46.153
Just watch them.

45:46.606 --> 45:48.891
The Ferris wheel has begun to shudder to a stop.

45:49.433 --> 45:57.872
A boy about two with a sticky lollipop gets off and starts running through the crowd before his mother can extricate the remaining child, a large girl with back to his eyes.

45:58.694 --> 46:01.982
She yells at the crowd to stop him, but they do nothing.

46:02.452 --> 46:04.995
You squeeze my hand and lead me to run after the kid.

46:05.596 --> 46:10.462
I watch as you part the crowd, your hands spreading the people away like shallow waves to the Red Sea.

46:10.962 --> 46:14.647
The child stumbles and starts to cry, not very far from the Pharisee line.

46:14.947 --> 46:18.111
You offer in your hands, and I think I can see your flaws in here.

46:18.611 --> 46:20.714
He cries louder and points to his shoe.

46:21.175 --> 46:24.038
You kneel like the Lord and Chesse tied the shoe up.

46:24.018 --> 46:29.865
The mother arrives, restless, carrying the girl half in, half out of an oversized door.

46:30.266 --> 46:32.429
You talk with her, stroking the boy's hair.

46:33.109 --> 46:37.515
Her back's lost my view, so I cannot see your smile now, but I imagine it.

46:38.036 --> 46:40.639
I imagine she smiles back at me.

46:40.659 --> 46:43.022
I nod to myself, smiling, like you are joining me.

46:43.923 --> 46:44.604
Thanks, I say.

46:45.565 --> 46:47.207
You would have done the same, you say.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.341
No, okay.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.024
I would have been too afraid to care.

46:50.885 --> 46:51.746
Are you sure, you ask?

46:52.647 --> 46:54.470
I just knocked my shoulders.

46:54.490 --> 46:55.071
Okay, one more.

46:55.091 --> 46:56.573
We can go to turn.

46:56.593 --> 47:00.879
They do nothing, people will say, or we can hit it.

47:01.359 --> 47:01.620
Okay.

47:02.241 --> 47:05.064
As you can see, we've been going through the poem.

47:05.084 --> 47:08.389
This was enter, deny, reach, forever.

47:09.350 --> 47:11.173
As the wheel goes around.

47:13.156 --> 47:14.157
Oh, okay.

47:15.014 --> 47:21.001
But each time we could go around in circles, and we're getting close to the end of it.

47:21.021 --> 47:21.481
Friendships.

47:23.183 --> 47:24.985
The ride left slow, letting people off.

47:25.546 --> 47:28.689
Teenagers beg for another ride, refusing to move.

47:28.709 --> 47:33.414
Unfazed, the attendant pulls one of the girls out of the car, and the rest of the girls follow.

47:33.975 --> 47:38.260
We can hear their laughter as they get out, watch them enter another line, another light.

47:39.141 --> 47:40.482
The blue car is now around.

47:41.069 --> 47:47.458
As if in a black and white style of movie, this scrawny gentleman shows the wiser lady off, bowing first and offering her hand.

47:50.262 --> 47:53.266
She takes it, raises it in a Vigon waltz, and finds out.

47:53.726 --> 48:01.197
Their expressions are too far away for us to see, and they are poor Simon actors, for they do not dip and kiss.

48:01.217 --> 48:05.422
Rather, they must be talking of common places, of nothing in particular.

48:06.344 --> 48:07.405
No one else watches them.

48:08.567 --> 48:10.249
They hug slightly, comfortably,

48:10.415 --> 48:11.056
walk off.

48:11.656 --> 48:15.540
We have been friends for a long time now, but nowhere near as long as those two have.

48:15.980 --> 48:16.741
This is obvious.

48:17.502 --> 48:21.626
Suddenly, I no longer want the asphalt to become a piece of black oblivion.

48:22.126 --> 48:26.811
I want it to be a long road under us, supporting us.

48:26.831 --> 48:28.893
I want to be friends with it, too.

48:31.075 --> 48:36.019
Before I just show you the site map, I'll show you how this wheel works again.

48:36.119 --> 48:39.983
But this is a marriage between a poetry and

48:40.418 --> 48:47.729
a short story so that she can see the poem again and again each of the links goes into another short story.

48:50.814 --> 49:00.909
Thank you.

49:01.009 --> 49:07.759
Architecture and design have become key components in the building of Hypertext.

49:08.093 --> 49:12.579
And the wheel has been a frequent and useful model.

49:14.061 --> 49:30.123
Here in the 1994 MFA thesis by our colleague at the keyboard, Bobby Rabbit, having just discovered his, actually I should have said Robert Arellano, because at this moment in this thesis he had just discovered this online alter ego of Bobby Rabbit.

49:30.704 --> 49:35.991
He rebuilt the bicycle, researching the mechanical ingenuity

49:36.140 --> 49:53.595
In the words Wright and Derardieu, Bobby devised a structure of interlocking, yet independent, wheels, whereby the reader could crank the pedals toggling between parallel stories, or sit back in the saddle and coast through one narrative at a time.

49:56.118 --> 50:00.802
Poetry has, I say this, before I leave circles behind, I'm going to have it go.

50:00.822 --> 50:01.762
We almost scratched this.

50:02.003 --> 50:04.645
Hope it doesn't crash our system in troubled director before.

50:05.333 --> 50:13.202
But in this semester's Advanced Electronic Composition Workshop, first year graduate fiction writer and poet, John Morrissey, is also working with wheels.

50:14.323 --> 50:16.426
His poem is called My Name is Captain Captain.

50:17.126 --> 50:34.326
And these are based on the dead reckoning navigational techniques of early airline pilots.

50:34.366 --> 50:35.307
Cross your fingers.

50:43.488 --> 50:47.313
Are you frozen out?

50:49.096 --> 50:49.917
There we are.

50:49.977 --> 50:59.791
Click on that.

50:59.932 --> 51:08.584
It's a very visual poem, and we're using something here called rollovers, which just by passing the cursor over changes the screen.

51:10.454 --> 51:18.462
And here he's bringing up words, slowly if he's working to find all the different pieces.

51:23.187 --> 51:34.077
There you go.

51:34.097 --> 51:37.000
It's running a little slow because it's off a zip drive.

51:37.020 --> 51:37.761
Because it's off a zip drive, right.

51:40.880 --> 51:49.188
It's a way of kind of locating the bits and pieces of all of them.

51:49.208 --> 51:49.729
There we go.

51:55.135 --> 52:02.942
I think you can click on that.

52:02.963 --> 52:04.064
You can pull the words out.

52:04.084 --> 52:05.745
Click on them and pull them out, I think.

52:05.765 --> 52:05.865
Yeah.

52:05.885 --> 52:06.086
Oops.

52:08.588 --> 52:10.330
The fast button.

52:11.474 --> 52:14.057
Who's that?

52:17.020 --> 52:18.622
Okay, well, it's a glimmering.

52:18.822 --> 52:22.306
We need to judge the demo, and I suspect.

52:22.567 --> 52:29.435
But in any case, I would say that poetry itself has prospered in this new medium, perhaps more even than fiction has.

52:29.695 --> 52:41.008
Narrative, as a literary form, moves typically from A to B, something confident, and is driven by the question, what happens next?

52:41.512 --> 52:50.366
So it's had to cope with the paradoxically contrary nature of the multi-directional web works of hyperfiction.

52:50.386 --> 52:59.440
But poetry, especially miracle poetry, in which typically a single subject becomes the center of many peripheral meditations, has often found those web works most congenial.

52:59.460 --> 53:06.270
One of the most spectacular, committed, and highly skilled technologically at these new hyperpoets is Jim Rosenberg.

53:06.706 --> 53:15.414
who's intensely active and immensely helpful contributions to our discussion page these past few weeks have helped us set the agenda for everything that follows.

53:15.834 --> 53:27.365
Here's Jim to read for this work.

53:27.385 --> 53:29.687
Thank you.

53:30.407 --> 53:31.949
I'm really delighted to be here.

53:32.569 --> 53:35.532
This is an amazing gathering of people.

53:36.575 --> 53:38.477
and hopefully historic.

53:41.179 --> 53:49.166
I thought I would do something a little bit different with my time and take you a bit behind the scenes of one of my pieces.

53:53.711 --> 54:05.181
I'm dead serious about the issue of the call for this conference, and I'd like to show you a little bit about what I feel that I have at stake here

54:05.920 --> 54:07.042
from the tool designers.

54:11.288 --> 54:32.400
We've had several references, Michael talked about it and Dean talked about it, about how even though it may seem that this is brand new work, we really are going on the basis of a long period of experimentation by a lot of people in a lot of arts

54:33.562 --> 55:02.539
and i want to echo that a person who was the most influential in my life artistically was the composer john cage when i was an undergraduate i used to hang out with the music people and i found that the composers were all talking about something called tone clusters and i heard that and i said wow that is the neatest thing i ever heard i want to do that with words and i've been trying to figure out that ever since

55:04.662 --> 55:15.891
Now, this is a single piece from a piece called the Barrier Frames, Finality, Crystal, Shunt, Curl, Chant, Quickening, Giveaway, Stare.

55:17.733 --> 55:20.776
There are nine, and this is one cluster.

55:21.316 --> 55:30.584
And the way that this works is that as you approach the cluster, then a random one of these frames pops up.

55:33.286 --> 55:34.467
And then there are

55:35.054 --> 55:37.358
There are clusters inside of clusters.

55:39.983 --> 55:46.394
And this is all done with what in JavaScript would be called on mouse over, but this isn't done in JavaScript.

55:46.434 --> 55:55.491
So as you move along, then a different one of these layers can be read.

55:55.511 --> 55:57.635
Now, I couldn't get a reading.

55:57.655 --> 55:57.855
Beautiful.

56:00.147 --> 56:17.329
I couldn't give a reading of this work, and I do do that, but time is very short, and I thought it would be fun to actually take you behind the scenes of this and to explain to you, despite the appearances, why I am in deep trouble with this work.

56:19.051 --> 56:19.411
Okay.

56:19.972 --> 56:24.538
So, I can't do this with the mouse, because if I do this with the mouse, it will change.

56:24.558 --> 56:28.703
But...

56:28.885 --> 56:49.287
I think of this as an object.

56:49.307 --> 56:52.470
This is a cluster of words on top of one another.

56:52.490 --> 56:55.213
And that object is plugged into

56:55.463 --> 56:59.649
this larger object, which is basically behind this phrase here.

57:00.830 --> 57:05.476
And then that object is a layer in another object.

57:05.556 --> 57:09.121
Oops, I think I got the wrong one.

57:10.503 --> 57:12.285
So that's how I think of these things.

57:14.108 --> 57:15.790
Now let me show you the reality.

57:15.990 --> 57:16.711
It's gruesome.

57:21.878 --> 57:23.580
Now this is hypercharged.

57:24.809 --> 57:30.756
And I'm really starting to feel like a geezer talking about HyperCard.

57:30.776 --> 57:31.517
It's very strange.

57:33.059 --> 57:33.480
What's that?

57:34.280 --> 57:48.758
HyperCard is a very, very generable tool, but it allowed me to do a lot of this kind of work many years ago when things like OnMouseOver and JavaScript didn't exist.

57:50.088 --> 58:03.652
One of the things that's kind of amazing about this is that when we talk about text and the word and so on, there is no text here in the technical sense.

58:04.614 --> 58:11.326
So if you went into hypercar and did a find on parade clay, you wouldn't find it.

58:12.989 --> 58:14.391
This is all done with graphics.

58:15.063 --> 58:18.828
And the reason that it's done with graphics is that that way I can control it.

58:18.848 --> 58:21.551
I don't have to worry about fonts and all that stuff.

58:21.571 --> 58:24.835
So how does all the other stuff happen?

58:25.296 --> 58:31.784
Well, this is a button which I put in place by hand.

58:35.028 --> 58:38.252
And I have to put the mic down.

58:44.999 --> 58:49.905
Okay, all you programmers out there, I want you to take notes.

58:49.925 --> 58:51.487
This is a really stunning algorithm.

58:56.613 --> 58:59.155
This is about as tough as my algorithms get.

59:03.280 --> 59:09.067
Well, I lied.

59:09.087 --> 59:12.151
Wow, there's some real code in there.

59:12.751 --> 59:14.213
This is as tough as they get.

59:15.982 --> 59:26.777
Actually, we can make jokes about this, but the question of what is the aesthetic role of the algorithm is a very interesting question.

59:27.858 --> 59:33.526
One poet who's not here, whose name I would like to mention, is John Haley.

59:34.327 --> 59:42.698
John is living in Kingville and has probably done the most daring work that I know of with that whole issue of making the algorithm into an aesthetic object.

59:44.365 --> 59:54.275
What I want to emphasize to you here is that I have to assemble all this stuff by hand, and that is extremely laborious.

59:56.177 --> 01:00:06.468
I have a sort of rule of thumb that I like to spend roughly 85% of my time with the words and the rest with the structure, and to assemble this piece was excruciating.

01:00:07.749 --> 01:00:13.275
So, what I would really like to be able to do is to take a cluster like this and actually

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.623
You know, throw me a bag.

01:00:16.963 --> 01:00:37.587
I had this wonderful pickle jar at home that dates back to the 70s where I lettered words each on its own space and did word environments and I would throw the words into phrases in the pickle jar and when people would ask me how much work I had, I'd say about a gallon.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.093
That's what I want to do.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.063
That is currently extremely difficult.

01:00:46.423 --> 01:00:50.148
So you'll notice that this work is really visual.

01:00:50.468 --> 01:00:53.652
I use drawing tools to prototype all of this.

01:00:53.752 --> 01:00:57.156
I don't really work in hypercardinative to get this visual effect.

01:00:59.278 --> 01:01:06.266
And I drastically need something that will carry all these buttons with the object.

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:13.114
So if I change my mind about where something really is supposed to be,

01:01:14.562 --> 01:01:39.374
If I change my mind about how this works visually, that affects all of the layers that are on top of this, and I have to do all that by hand, I should be able to pick this stuff up and move it.

01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:42.779
And all the buttons should come with it.

01:01:42.859 --> 01:01:43.860
That seems simple,

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.779
At any rate, I think I've spoken long enough.

01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:50.581
I would just like to say one more thing.

01:01:52.283 --> 01:01:56.228
You will notice as I've been operating this, there are no links here.

01:01:58.892 --> 01:02:02.337
This is entirely spatial association.

01:02:04.159 --> 01:02:06.362
I'm tickled to death that Kathy Marshall is here.

01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:10.267
Kathy and her colleagues have practically invented spatial hypertext.

01:02:12.851 --> 01:02:16.075
If you look over the proceedings at the last hypertext conference,

01:02:16.628 --> 01:02:21.935
A truly astonishing number of papers are now referencing spatial hypertext.

01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:28.284
Please, when you think about hypertext, keep an open mind about what structures we need.

01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:35.013
The short answer to what structures we writers need is all of them.

01:02:35.053 --> 01:02:46.568
Thank you.

01:02:47.206 --> 01:02:51.871
pieces available via Eastgate's publishing.

01:02:52.212 --> 01:02:55.155
You might like to look around a gorgeous piece.

01:02:56.516 --> 01:03:03.004
The first question is being raised to maybe no longer even need poets.

01:03:04.045 --> 01:03:15.778
In this semester's advanced workshop, undergraduate student Rylan Wharton has contrived a spectacular poet regenerator based on semantic and syntactic structures

01:03:16.113 --> 01:03:17.655
randomly accessed.

01:03:25.846 --> 01:03:28.650
I and Tom Sawyer lie painfully.

01:03:29.612 --> 01:03:35.820
California believes gravestones hate snowflakes hesitantly.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.146
Saratoga Springs seeks the only elegant cadaver.

01:03:43.113 --> 01:03:57.269
There would probably be an infinite number of, the bottom went, oh, Microsoft wrote my heart.

01:04:02.455 --> 01:04:09.703
We had thought perhaps, if we could just bring up Todd Berman's piece if you can just for a moment to get a glimpse of something else that's happening.

01:04:09.723 --> 01:04:12.006
We were wanting to look at other student work, we were going to rush on.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:32.847
I was going to mention two or three things, such as Matt Derby's current project, which is about a person who has to erase characters, black characters, and actually uses in his hypertext, you watch frames of famous movies being altered.

01:04:33.552 --> 01:04:39.181
Laura Lee, who has a very large architects built around the map of Los Angeles.

01:04:39.221 --> 01:04:43.247
You have to move through the whole map to understand the architects being built there.

01:04:43.888 --> 01:04:52.240
Or Adam Tobin's quite beautiful sequence of the fox.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.243
Say it for me.

01:04:55.966 --> 01:04:59.391
Quick brown fox jumped over the lazy brown dog.

01:04:59.624 --> 01:05:07.572
So he's built across the ground, all of those words, and you trace them down through a sense of beautiful things to see.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:28.753
The one we were just flashing up was from some time back when Todd Berman was working, another undergraduate here, on trying to keep text from being stable, and developed several pieces in which, this is a good example, once it starts to, you're not going to be able to reach the start mechanism.

01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:35.689
It's a screen.

01:05:35.769 --> 01:05:38.353
Can't do much about it.

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:58.644
It was a piece about revelation, and the idea was that each time this character in the novel, in the hyper-novel, was moving about trying to understand revelatory experiences, he would actually encompass them in a language of his experience would begin to change.

01:05:58.785 --> 01:06:00.968
So as you're starting to read a text, there we go.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:07.397
The text, actually, before you finish it, begins to alter and change itself.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.120
Cool.

01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:10.701
OK.

01:06:12.923 --> 01:06:18.390
Our next reader, this one is, after all these fancy stuff, it's a quick time thing.

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:29.183
I want to get back to one of our classic software systems that we've used here at Brown very successfully, and especially we've been talking about it in our workshops lately as we move to HTML and the web.

01:06:29.348 --> 01:06:55.207
the great advantages of story space, developed by Eastgate, and in fact, partially developed by at least two persons here tonight, J. David Boulter and Michael Joyce, and a great proponent of that is the fiction writer Bill Watt.

01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:56.048
I'm just going to read it.

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:08.835
of my life.

01:07:08.855 --> 01:07:22.970
We Descend is provided with a default path or tour, which will let first-time readers just sort of hit the return or ride away with returns through about a third of the writing spaces.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:34.422
And I'm going to read a couple of passages that are off the default path so you can see how you have to navigate otherwise.

01:07:47.227 --> 01:07:48.329
scholars farewell.

01:07:55.259 --> 01:07:58.284
These circumstances which occasioned it have not been recorded elsewhere.

01:07:58.985 --> 01:08:02.530
One hardly knows what else to say about this poignant communication.

01:08:06.376 --> 01:08:07.398
I wish there were more times.

01:08:08.199 --> 01:08:12.846
I feel I've only just begun the actual work and suddenly I must give over to another.

01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:19.415
to you, whose care of the archives will naturally be dictated by your own preoccupations.

01:08:19.435 --> 01:08:21.057
My curacy is over now.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.646
I have decided not to withhold anything, but instead to offer up the entire story and let you decide how to proceed.

01:08:31.687 --> 01:08:42.158
Since I am to have no say with what is done with or to the archives, nor any access to them after the handing over, I have resolved not to serve badly my precious charge,

01:08:42.425 --> 01:08:49.034
in these last days by making it difficult for my supplanter to come to the same appreciation of its worth.

01:08:50.677 --> 01:08:53.100
This may be made difficult for you by others.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:57.466
As the remnant said, beware the giver with nothing to gain.

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:10.204
I urge you not to depend upon the benignity of your sponsors, not to give offense, but the conference members surely regard this as minor research.

01:09:10.724 --> 01:09:12.386
or it wouldn't have been interrupted to you.

01:09:13.347 --> 01:09:21.618
Be you never so promising, you are hardly in their class, at least in their minds, and have any of your betters regard this project as really important.

01:09:21.638 --> 01:09:24.362
You may be sure he would have seized upon it himself.

01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:31.351
On the other hand, they clearly believed the archives important enough to take them away from me.

01:09:32.473 --> 01:09:36.478
What they most likely told you is that this would be a good project for their golden protégé.

01:09:37.117 --> 01:09:41.301
thus trivializing not only all my labor, but the archives themselves.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:49.290
Well, I put myself under their power, more than full me, so I mustn't complain of maltreatment.

01:09:50.071 --> 01:09:53.835
But I will never forgive their light regard for the object of my life's work.

01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:59.541
And if you are wise, you will realize that you too have been trivialized in this maneuver.

01:10:02.104 --> 01:10:06.128
I'm also, for the sake of time, going to do a little on-the-fly editing.

01:10:07.525 --> 01:10:12.530
I have every confidence that you've been told I'm a crackbomb.

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:25.924
That as may be, I only ask that you come to that conclusion on your own, on the basis of the work I've done, not on the superficial pronouncements of self-important men who have no idea of the value of this treasure.

01:10:25.944 --> 01:10:28.687
Think of what's most important to them, reputation.

01:10:29.507 --> 01:10:33.892
Then read the archives.

01:10:33.912 --> 01:10:34.953
Now to the matter at hand.

01:10:36.054 --> 01:10:36.975
Included herein

01:10:37.242 --> 01:10:44.454
in addition to the archives themselves, are all my notes, abstracts, conjectures, drafts, and diagrams.

01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:52.728
I apologize for their disarray, but I was given only enough time to put the archives themselves into some kind of arrangement.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:11:00.522
No doubt you will find this arrangement unsatisfactory and will wish to assemble the writings according to your own sense of their proper presentation.

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:01.343
I cannot stop you.

01:11:01.677 --> 01:11:12.653
but would plead that I had good reason for putting things in the order I did, even if I was not allowed legion to write out in detail the rationale for that order.

01:11:12.673 --> 01:11:26.913
At some later date, when I have had time to regain my composure, I will send you any final thoughts I may have on the archives, either advice based on my experience with them or further meditations upon their significance.

01:11:26.933 --> 01:11:29.777
You will, of course, be entirely free to ignore these messages

01:11:30.196 --> 01:11:32.180
if they are permitted to reach you at all.

01:11:33.402 --> 01:11:39.633
But please know that I hereby freely renounce any right I may have imagined I had to control their destiny.

01:11:40.394 --> 01:11:47.968
Having made their way through millennia to me and now to you, their capacity to survive can hardly be in doubt.

01:11:59.778 --> 01:12:02.121
Ecderis and the Historian.

01:12:06.508 --> 01:12:13.458
This small section, incomplete though it is, contains information vital to understanding Ecderis' subsequent actions.

01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:28.840
It is edifying, despite these inconsistencies, to read it in conjunction with the material allegedly written by the historian, especially the last few pages of the notebook, which tragically blew out of time for.

01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:40.827
Little Marquito found him, sitting inside the old guard tower, his back propped against the door frame so that he could see the cliff opposite.

01:12:40.847 --> 01:12:48.236
Marquito had told me he was dead, but when we entered the enclosure, my leg buckled and I fell against him, nearly knocking him off the stool.

01:12:49.518 --> 01:12:54.584
Marquito grabbed for him, but the man's hand went out and he steadied himself.

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:55.906
I hadn't yet seen his face.

01:12:56.867 --> 01:12:59.130
When I did, I nearly fell over myself.

01:12:59.887 --> 01:13:02.429
It was the historian, my old darling.

01:13:06.933 --> 01:13:09.456
I see you have adopted the methods of your former master.

01:13:09.796 --> 01:13:11.277
Why should he be known as the good doctor?

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:13.639
What is your little scribe's name?

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.021
Markito?

01:13:15.681 --> 01:13:22.487
He's prettier than you, dearest Pharaoh, but not as pretty as you were then, the last time I saw you, when we almost had time.

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:28.813
Oh, my dear, how often I've thought of you, your sweet mouth, your fierce eyes,

01:13:29.283 --> 01:13:31.946
How the tears rolled down your face when you drove me away.

01:13:31.966 --> 01:13:38.132
I loved you for saving me, of course, but had things been different, I would have loved you a better way.

01:13:40.094 --> 01:13:41.115
Pain.

01:13:41.135 --> 01:13:41.815
Cannot speak.

01:13:44.078 --> 01:13:48.162
Now I am more lame than you, little Agderas, and only because I was careless.

01:13:49.002 --> 01:13:54.047
They tried to teach me not to be careless, but I was never a good student, except on my own projects.

01:13:55.129 --> 01:13:58.632
It was the same carelessness that brought me into the good doctor's clutches.

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:02.158
But that was also what brought me to you, did it not?

01:14:02.999 --> 01:14:05.241
So yesterday's evil blesses me today.

01:14:06.723 --> 01:14:12.148
And perhaps my demise will meet a great victory for you in some way that neither of us can foresee.

01:14:12.989 --> 01:14:18.194
As a historian, which many people believe me to be, I saw that such things happen all the time.

01:14:19.315 --> 01:14:25.041
And as a man who can no longer walk, I perceive the abyss beneath the feet of everyone who can.

01:14:25.763 --> 01:14:29.227
though they do not see it, and would be unable to move if they could.

01:14:29.267 --> 01:14:35.314
Perhaps you've known this all along, and can only wonder why it took me so long to find it out.

01:14:39.799 --> 01:14:43.003
I've dreamed of this day, little brother, and now there is no time.

01:14:43.944 --> 01:14:48.269
At the bottom of this cliff, perhaps in the water, though I hope not, is a satchel.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.552
It went over the edge when I fell.

01:14:51.513 --> 01:14:55.618
In it were the most precious, priceless artifacts that one can find in this world.

01:14:56.071 --> 01:14:57.773
because they do not come from this world.

01:14:59.715 --> 01:15:07.244
That other world was so magnificent as to make the Golios, in all his splendor, look like a farmer dressed up for a neighbor's wedding.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:09.947
In fact, I have stolen these things.

01:15:10.628 --> 01:15:12.169
I don't believe they will be missed soon.

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:15.013
But when they are, there may be some trouble for you.

01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:16.635
I'm sorry for that.

01:15:18.637 --> 01:15:22.281
Who they are is explained in my notebook in the stachel.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:42.576
Other than the description the historian gives in the notebook, which vids, of the appearance and dress of his benefactors, no further explanation of their identity has survived, though naturally speculation abounds.

01:15:42.596 --> 01:15:44.478
Maybe Marquito here could go fetch it.

01:15:45.219 --> 01:15:48.842
I believe it's important that they be kept dry and not be permitted to freeze.

01:15:50.524 --> 01:15:51.044
Cries out.

01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:52.426
Pain longer.

01:15:53.066 --> 01:15:53.387
Deeper.

01:15:54.147 --> 01:15:55.188
Eve examines him.

01:15:55.889 --> 01:15:57.010
Blood on his chin now.

01:15:58.863 --> 01:16:02.066
mumbles, nonsense sounds.

01:16:02.086 --> 01:16:10.516
I was drunk, giving a speech, telling funny stories, making things up, in some drinking place surrounded by my friends.

01:16:11.356 --> 01:16:13.299
Well, I thought they were my friends.

01:16:13.339 --> 01:16:14.340
They laughed at my jokes.

01:16:15.201 --> 01:16:16.262
I was brilliant that night.

01:16:16.602 --> 01:16:18.324
My tongue seemed to sing by itself.

01:16:18.704 --> 01:16:20.506
The witty phrases just tumbled out.

01:16:21.107 --> 01:16:24.130
They were all looking at me, their eyes shining.

01:16:25.572 --> 01:16:28.515
Maybe, stops breathing.

01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:55.467
Lying on the earth, gazing at stars through the haze, through a nexus of branches, at peace, filled with peace, nothing but peace, peace and stillness, the end of life, its purpose, its terminus, its dearest hope, the last moment, the end of time.

01:16:57.929 --> 01:17:03.514
The stars at last are kind, the moon no longer a face after death blow.

01:17:04.557 --> 01:17:07.621
The earth opens, one pore at a time.

01:17:09.763 --> 01:17:10.945
Go thy ways, little one.

01:17:13.088 --> 01:17:16.592
Time rises through you, a shoot through a fallen leaf.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:33.433
You sink into its past, your past, the past of everything that bore you up when you skimmed across the earth, a stone skipping on the lake, sinking now at last, the lake only again.

01:17:34.628 --> 01:17:47.907
at last.

01:17:47.927 --> 01:17:56.439
There are four more pieces, four more readers, and all some of the more exciting work of what's coming, including some virtual reality.

01:17:58.623 --> 01:18:01.767
Meanwhile, there's a switch to platforms involved on the job here.

01:18:04.193 --> 01:18:08.162
And in this moment of down time,
