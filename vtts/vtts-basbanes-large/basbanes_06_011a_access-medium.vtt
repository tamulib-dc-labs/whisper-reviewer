00:02.545 --> 00:05.630
We're talking to Alan Driven at the University of Texas.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.252
He's a professor in the Department of English.

00:07.292 --> 00:08.514
I just need this for the tape.

00:09.355 --> 00:14.944
Who is working on a biography of Harry Ransom to be titled Harry Hunt Ransom, colon?

00:15.425 --> 00:20.873
No, Harry Hunt Ransom and the Humanities, a university, colon, a university life.

00:20.893 --> 00:23.737
Do you have a publisher for this?

00:23.757 --> 00:28.484
A tentative contract with the University of Texas.

00:28.504 --> 00:31.489
I began my scholarly career

00:31.908 --> 00:39.215
preparing an annotated catalog of Mark Clinton's reading and dropped by the University of Virginia.

00:40.616 --> 00:43.558
They urged me to call Seawater Parrot.

00:43.578 --> 00:48.002
I couldn't believe that he could just call him up like that.

00:48.022 --> 01:01.054
But he called him up and he came rattling down in a car I don't recall being very impressive looking and said, oh yeah, I think I've got some twain here somewhere.

01:01.523 --> 01:15.435
I pitched around in the backseat and got a box out, and it had, oh, I remember there's been a dozen or fifteen books from our son's library heavily annotated, some that were very important.

01:15.455 --> 01:17.877
I didn't mean to give these to the library only.

01:17.977 --> 01:21.680
I just might as well walk them in now.

01:21.700 --> 01:30.788
I think it may have been one of the reasons the library was interested in contacting him, because it might remind him that he had these around.

01:31.207 --> 01:41.662
He was just as affable and approachable as possible and wanted to be terribly helpful to my project.

01:41.682 --> 01:48.912
And then he got in his car and took off, and I took the books into the library and used them, and I guess left them there for the library to accession.

01:50.394 --> 01:53.799
So I really consider him like an aid of people.

01:53.819 --> 01:59.847
Now, in the field of twain studies, as far as I know, there are only a couple of large

02:00.417 --> 02:05.023
collectors now, and none of them are multi-millionaires.

02:05.644 --> 02:17.961
There are some millionaires who have bought some plain things, but have not restricted as far as I know their collection.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.484
High-classes of electricity.

02:19.924 --> 02:28.416
Clint Eastwood's producer, Robert David, for example, has picked up a few months later, but he buys rather, it seems to me, almost on hand, and he'll pass up perfectly nice items.

02:29.122 --> 02:36.990
But Nick Karanovich, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, probably is the largest holding.

02:37.230 --> 02:39.993
Karanovich with a K?

02:40.013 --> 02:40.173
Yes.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.595
A-R-A-N-O-V-I-C-H.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.918
Exactly.

02:44.938 --> 02:45.258
Yes.

02:45.278 --> 02:46.920
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

02:47.380 --> 02:47.460
Yes.

02:47.641 --> 02:50.824
He's, I believe, a middle school, might be an elementary school or a middle school.

02:51.605 --> 02:51.925
Really?

02:51.945 --> 02:54.167
But he's just, he got in it early.

02:54.187 --> 02:56.589
He's worked at it very diligently.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.112
And he is rather learned.

02:59.800 --> 03:21.372
I've published a number of articles recently on Mark Twain, and he's got a big exhibit coming out at the middle of, because I'm going to the middle, so I think I did take a little probably, and me and I gave him, and he's preparing it.

03:21.592 --> 03:22.894
I don't know exactly the month.

03:22.914 --> 03:25.918
He kind of called me a few months ago to see him, right?

03:25.938 --> 03:27.681
He's here to write the catalog, whatever they're preparing for it.

03:28.336 --> 03:30.480
Is he in the phone book, correct?

03:30.560 --> 03:31.882
Will I be able to find him?

03:31.902 --> 03:32.804
I would think so.

03:32.824 --> 03:42.822
I mean, he's not at all a type of, you know, specific figure.

03:43.102 --> 03:53.280
There's one fellow here in Austin, probably his question is not extensive enough, but in a book that he's,

03:53.750 --> 03:57.073
probably the second or third ranking of my 20 collector.

03:57.293 --> 04:05.380
He's a very book dealer named Kevin MacDonald, M-A-C-D-O-N-N-E-L-L.

04:05.681 --> 04:10.205
He's the guy we called on Christmas morning one year to buy a book from.

04:10.225 --> 04:11.346
He's tremendously knowledgeable.

04:11.506 --> 04:15.249
I think Kevin is just one of the reasons I've enjoyed living around him.

04:15.329 --> 04:18.572
I just depend on him.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.154
You cannot stump Kevin on American literature.

04:21.174 --> 04:22.896
You can ask him anything.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.423
and he will know down to the smallest detail.

04:27.844 --> 04:29.866
That's interesting because he sells Mark Twain.

04:30.026 --> 04:31.727
He lists Mark Twain.

04:32.348 --> 04:34.910
Yeah, but he may be assured that he already has a copy.

04:34.950 --> 04:39.695
Yeah, but I mean, that's very unusual to have a dealer who collects some of it that he sells.

04:39.815 --> 04:41.356
Well, it makes him very knowledgeable about it.

04:41.376 --> 04:49.124
His catalog descriptions are like reading a fine scholarly article.

04:49.424 --> 04:52.647
Of course, he lists a lot of other things, too.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.745
and even does some work in British, but primarily American.

04:57.106 --> 05:01.111
He has his books out at his house, which are west of Austin, and are very lovely.

05:01.131 --> 05:11.587
Kind of like, what's that from in western Massachusetts?

05:11.707 --> 05:19.478
Howard Mott has this huge three-story home, and by appointment we walk in,

05:20.791 --> 05:23.154
The books are in the bedroom and everywhere.

05:23.174 --> 05:25.656
You're telling me about somebody I don't know, by the way, Howard Mott?

05:25.856 --> 05:36.347
Howard Mott, yes, and his son has gradually taken over the firm as Howard Page's Rusty Mott, and Howard's wife is... What's the firm?

05:36.367 --> 05:36.968
What do they do?

05:37.108 --> 05:43.475
It's called Howard Mott Books, and it specializes an Americana.

05:43.495 --> 05:44.997
It's a wonderful firm.

05:45.017 --> 05:45.617
Southwestern there?

05:47.039 --> 05:47.299
Mm-hmm.

05:47.579 --> 05:49.161
It's a nice little jog over there to...

05:49.462 --> 05:51.785
Who did your Mark Twain book?

05:53.247 --> 05:58.113
My book was called Mark Twain's Library, a Reconstruction, and it came out in 1980.

05:58.714 --> 05:59.976
Two volumes, G.K.

06:00.016 --> 06:00.276
Hall.

06:02.919 --> 06:04.121
It didn't stay in print very long.

06:04.161 --> 06:11.591
It sold out within 16 months, and their decision was not to reprint it because it was so expensive.

06:11.611 --> 06:17.258
It was two volumes, and I don't know if you remember, but right around 79 or 80, the IRS

06:18.014 --> 06:23.662
They made a ruling that publishers were responsible for inventory in the warehouse.

06:23.822 --> 06:24.563
That was a terrible rule.

06:24.603 --> 06:30.772
They got suddenly nervous by having this two-volume, thousand-page book.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.674
It's become quite a collective item itself.

06:32.774 --> 06:40.224
It's sometimes listed in their book catalogs, and I, along with everyone else, always tries to get another copy of it.

06:40.244 --> 06:42.127
Yeah, well, I'll keep my eyes open.

06:42.147 --> 06:44.090
I'm sure Harvard has a set.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.194
I haven't done a lot of my research at writing.

06:48.153 --> 06:55.924
Thankfully, the institution is so close to us, and I haven't been there once or twice a week, so I'll just go on that list.

06:55.944 --> 07:04.395
Well, which brings us, I guess, to Harry Lantz, and why are you doing it with Harry Lantz?

07:04.415 --> 07:16.692
This book is the first book that has ever been written about a UT administrator, and really, I think that's probably the...

07:17.853 --> 07:23.379
the thing that interested the university most in my project.

07:25.161 --> 07:27.564
Was this generated by you, or was it proposed to you?

07:27.784 --> 07:40.239
Well, the chancellor of the University of Texas System had been looking for some years for someone interested in undertaking something like this.

07:40.259 --> 07:46.746
He had been the secretary of the Air Force working here, and he's been one of the top people at NASA.

07:47.975 --> 08:12.037
He is a firm believer that institutions should have heroes, or rather institutions do have heroes, and those heroes should be somehow permanently memorialized in more than just a sketch or a statue or a painting, which there are a number of periodonties around the campus.

08:13.398 --> 08:16.581
When he got here, he was rather surprised

08:17.303 --> 08:23.790
no one who contributed to the shaping of the university in a large way had ever been written about.

08:23.810 --> 08:36.725
And inquired around and I think his notice landed on me because I was one of the people who came here because of this library.

08:37.786 --> 08:38.787
I came here in 1974.

08:38.807 --> 08:42.231
I had actually visited the campus in 1970 as part of my

08:43.055 --> 08:56.991
for my doctoral dissertation on Twain's library and reading.

08:59.233 --> 09:02.617
We used to do that right now at the University of California at Berkeley.

09:02.637 --> 09:07.222
I was Henry Nash Smith next to the last doctoral dissertation student at the University of California Berkeley.

09:07.242 --> 09:10.446
Smith was then just preeminent in the study of Mark Twain and I was very fortunate to be able to work on

09:11.270 --> 09:38.434
But I came here in 1970, in the middle of a very, I remember, sweltering, swelter in the hot July period, and I still liked very much the place and the library, and when I got an opportunity to join the Faculty Union, I figured to do it.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.956
Jobs were not too plentiful in 1974.

09:41.712 --> 10:01.410
Actually, I was lucky enough to get a number of offers, but Texas was far more than that later.

10:01.430 --> 10:07.276
When I came here, I actually only laid eyes on Harry Ransom once as he was walking across campus and I said, that's Harry Ransom.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.597
And then he passed away several years after I came here and died.

10:09.910 --> 10:24.451
But I'd always been very interested and even read what I could.

10:24.612 --> 10:33.144
And the chancellor spoke with me and indicated his wish that something would be done toward the audience.

10:33.164 --> 10:39.293
And the chancellor made arrangements so that I was able to address a group of people who were more than

10:40.049 --> 10:55.667
It's a group of very devoted individuals.

10:55.687 --> 10:59.011
Actually, the group was organized by Harry Lansom.

10:59.031 --> 11:09.162
And sometime after that, one individual in particular came forward and offered to substandard my research, and now I've been at it for more than half a year.

11:10.272 --> 11:13.475
How far along are you?

11:13.495 --> 11:20.361
Well, I'm about two-thirds through the research and about two-thirds through the interviews, probably.

11:20.381 --> 11:23.303
I've not started writing yet, but I don't know.

11:23.323 --> 11:27.647
I think I can start writing, but perhaps even at this moment .

11:27.667 --> 11:36.955
It's kind of awkward, though, isn't it, to be on the faculty and be writing a book for the University Prep?

11:36.975 --> 11:40.178
And I guess it's being funded by a member of the Chancellor's Council now?

11:40.327 --> 11:47.493
Do you feel that in any way that this kind of restricts the freedom that you might have in doing a critical work?

11:48.194 --> 12:10.333
Well, both the chancellor and the benefactor were quite emphatic that no strings were being put on this, that they wanted, they're more interested in having the book and that it be a good book and a readable book than having you write a saint's life.

12:10.617 --> 12:36.692
Not that I'm suggesting whether there's anything... It naturally occurred to me that the circumstances were not what most scholars are used to, that is, applying to a foundation or the National Endowment for Humanities or some such organization for funds.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.810
Still, we have a very devoted group of alumni.

12:41.371 --> 12:55.594
They remember Ransom very fondly, and it wasn't just this one individual, but several others have also contributed so that I feel as though I'm kind of a trustee of these funds here.

12:55.614 --> 13:04.688
I try to use them as well as I can, try not to raise any unnecessary expenses.

13:05.528 --> 13:08.751
But there is a lot of work to be done.

13:08.771 --> 13:25.205
You see, Ransom got into administration fairly early, became an associate dean, for example.

13:25.225 --> 13:34.033
And from then on, in other words, for, let's see, between 20 years, virtually every scrap of paper that he ever wrote or typed as an officer at university did.

13:34.486 --> 14:01.675
The materials over in the Barker, Texas History Center on the west edge of campus, excuse me, on the east edge of campus, occupied when I started with 52 file doors and cabinets and

14:02.600 --> 14:08.186
almost 20 feet of vertical space on shells.

14:08.807 --> 14:24.405
And today, for example, I've been over there going through Ransom's effort to deal with the first waves of the student dissident movement in the 1960s.

14:24.425 --> 14:29.991
It fell to his lot through the Chancellor and the Texas League for Responsible Sexual Freedom began passing out.

14:30.393 --> 14:53.236
youth that's advocating the abolition of all laws, restricting sexual matters, and shortly thereafter that was followed by threatened to cancel by Sophie Carmichael and the rise of SDS.

14:53.396 --> 14:58.341
Each day of my research has a culminating point that culminated this morning in

14:59.013 --> 15:27.418
in the SDS violation of Ransom's understanding of him and the holding of an illegal rally on campus on Sunday night to prepare for Vice President Humphrey's arrival on Monday, at which time they were going to try to harass him.

15:27.438 --> 15:28.699
And Ransom struck him from the campus organization and cut guy.

15:30.383 --> 15:45.096
So he began receiving this avalanche of correspondence thanking him or captivating him for his action.

15:45.116 --> 15:46.017
And so it goes.

15:46.037 --> 15:49.941
I mean, he then really had his initiation .

15:49.961 --> 15:52.763
Are all these filed indexed?

15:52.783 --> 15:53.584
Not very well.

15:55.186 --> 16:00.070
They're often indexed by year at least.

16:00.421 --> 16:12.901
to trace how he went about building this collection?

16:13.622 --> 16:22.256
Actually, the materials that specifically relate to the Humanities Research Center are kept over here.

16:23.117 --> 16:27.424
They are in a pile up on the fifth floor.

16:28.062 --> 16:37.055
reading room called the collection, I guess it should be called the collection development file.

16:37.075 --> 16:38.236
Are they open to scholars?

16:38.997 --> 16:41.100
I'm sure they are.

16:41.120 --> 16:57.563
I imagine I'm the first one to ever have shown in the entry room, but there are files in there by collector, by, and sometimes by name of the collection or by book dealer.

16:58.775 --> 17:02.641
There are a lot of bad ends there.

17:02.661 --> 17:07.969
One tends to forget how often you bring something almost to fruition.

17:08.069 --> 17:27.178
There was the famous instrument of the silver collection, for example, in which everything was negotiated, the price agreed to, and one of our scholars was getting on a plane with a certified check and so forth, and they were notified that

17:27.833 --> 17:49.457
The Newberry Library has grown very angry that this collection is going to leave Chicago, and a new arrangement hasn't worked out, and it's going to stay here.

17:49.477 --> 17:53.421
I think, actually, for less money, it would be... The Seymour Abelman collection is supposed to come here, I guess.

17:53.441 --> 17:54.062
Are you familiar with that?

17:54.082 --> 17:57.165
I don't think they're really close now, and I guess, of course, he's in Great Philadelphia, so he recently died.

17:57.635 --> 18:06.908
I just remember Philadelphia people who rose up.

18:06.928 --> 18:07.588
It's a good line.

18:07.749 --> 18:10.132
Sometimes these things generate outbursts of local pride.

18:10.472 --> 18:12.635
Which is good.

18:12.655 --> 18:13.216
Not indignation so much.

18:13.236 --> 18:22.208
Ransom never pursued any legal action on the silver matter.

18:22.228 --> 18:24.451
He was a little chagrined.

18:25.893 --> 18:26.494
When was this?

18:31.655 --> 18:36.682
in the 60s.

18:37.623 --> 18:39.646
I can't think of more precisely right now.

18:40.247 --> 18:45.714
I've got all the amazement.

18:45.734 --> 18:52.583
But the point is that the book dealer did go after these people and actually collected something.

18:52.603 --> 18:54.486
That is, he felt he was doing a commission there.

18:54.506 --> 18:55.367
You mean the deal was done?

18:55.427 --> 18:55.868
It was a done deal?

18:55.888 --> 18:55.988
Yeah.

18:56.649 --> 18:57.029
It was a done deal.

18:57.049 --> 18:58.071
Everything had been agreed to.

18:58.091 --> 18:59.052
I don't know that's there.

18:59.072 --> 18:59.653
It's an interesting story.

19:01.186 --> 19:06.494
They sent people here, I think Ransom and others had to get deposition.

19:06.514 --> 19:12.623
They didn't have anything to do with it, but I mean, they went themselves to parties in the suit, and they were looking for his commission now.

19:12.783 --> 19:22.236
And I mean, it's my impression that they did collect some money through the court, actually.

19:22.897 --> 19:28.305
I was looking through the Newberry history the other day.

19:28.325 --> 19:29.607
Have you seen that?

19:29.873 --> 19:38.285
It's a crutch, and it's a history of the Newbury Library.

19:38.365 --> 19:39.567
Is that a new book?

19:39.587 --> 19:53.267
And in the back, it lists, you know, just, it's a little chronological thing that we've done, and I noticed that in subsequent years, they sold off little pieces of the silver crutch, and they knew they were trying to make facts for me.

19:53.287 --> 19:54.408
Is this a new book on the Newbury Library?

19:55.089 --> 19:55.330
Yes.

19:55.350 --> 19:57.553
Something that I could call the Newbury and get a copy of?

19:57.573 --> 19:57.653
Yes.

19:58.342 --> 20:08.115
It's maybe a year old.

20:08.655 --> 20:20.371
I did see one in the... I brought it over and showed Tom Saleh, and he promptly ordered two or three copies of his R.C.

20:20.391 --> 20:24.576
There's probably one that I'm going to show you.

20:24.616 --> 20:27.420
I think one thing I'd like to mention and get on the record,

20:28.075 --> 20:39.634
before, I forget to mention it, and that is, I think it's very interesting.

20:40.135 --> 20:44.262
Ransom was scrupulous about not collecting any books himself.

20:44.282 --> 20:47.067
His library is kind of dead.

20:47.087 --> 20:48.750
He can virtually know books of any day.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.855
In other words, he just felt that he was entrusted to these.

20:52.493 --> 21:20.610
what amounted eventually to millions of dollars, and he could easily get misunderstood in the public mind, and so he loved greeting these arriving boxers and being around in the ropes and then so forth, and he derives me about a lot of satisfaction from the arrival, and probably he may have consoled it from them.

21:21.232 --> 21:27.560
he did not build any competing collection of his own.

21:28.281 --> 21:31.505
Now you find this, I find this among institutional collectors, and they are collectors.

21:31.525 --> 21:43.920
I think one of the people who collect, say, at the Massachusetts, Steve Riley at the Massachusetts Historical Society, Red Wolf, and he had his own idea.

21:43.940 --> 21:46.604
But the collection for the institution is basically there right there.

21:46.624 --> 21:47.024
They see it.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.247
They have collected for the institution, and the pleasure they get.

21:49.497 --> 21:52.882
And that is the holdings of the other .

21:52.902 --> 21:55.306
Well, why is it that you made a point in telling me that?

21:55.326 --> 21:57.169
Well, I just thought it was an interesting thing.

21:57.189 --> 22:04.860
Here is a man who loved books and denied himself that on a personal level, I think, for rather political reasons.

22:04.880 --> 22:08.326
I think he should be struck down by lightning.

22:08.346 --> 22:15.937
He didn't want anybody walking into that new library here and saying, I wonder how many of these should be in the HRC or something.

22:15.957 --> 22:18.441
But you didn't have reflected a sensitivity to

22:19.585 --> 22:26.351
to a perception of the spirit of collecting that that went on in Texas?

22:26.372 --> 22:29.615
I think there was a precaution on his part.

22:29.635 --> 22:36.021
He wanted to take every precaution to do that collection for the best possible meaning.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.483
It did not stop people from talking.

22:39.044 --> 22:41.166
Tell me what people said.

22:41.186 --> 22:43.228
What kinds of things that people said?

22:43.248 --> 22:48.833
Well, I guess the kindest critical things people said.

22:50.433 --> 22:56.783
no one will own up to it that they will save it or that they will save it.

22:56.803 --> 23:00.108
He sort of, you know, vicariously collected through the university.

23:00.128 --> 23:07.338
In other words, he got the regents, in effect, and put the bill for a collection that he wanted to sort of save for himself.

23:07.358 --> 23:19.056
And the fact that until they got the Senate done, and, you know, they didn't have anything like this at the time they began, he would keep the books up in his

23:19.643 --> 23:36.581
office up in the tower, where a few on the sixteenth floor, and someone's on the fiftieth floor as well.

23:36.601 --> 23:42.968
There'd be these stacks of boxes that you would kind of peek into the game, and the secretary would make some kind of memo on the box about what it was, and they wouldn't immediately be at session.

23:43.252 --> 24:11.065
Well, it was a fact that at the beginning, when the, what rare books facilities there were were over in the new building, it was a fact that they came in faster than

24:12.074 --> 24:17.401
and you could do anything about.

24:17.421 --> 24:30.339
What many people don't understand is that library funds or university funds have to be very specially delegated for this or for that.

24:30.419 --> 24:35.626
He had a knack right then for getting funds for acquisition.

24:35.646 --> 24:39.752
He didn't, I think he didn't want to complicate matters by trying to get funds for accessioning and doing those things that needed to be done with his book.

24:40.745 --> 25:01.791
And I must say that Decker Turner is a rather criticized figure.

25:01.811 --> 25:03.032
I'm thinking about a recent Texas-Memphis story and so forth.

25:03.052 --> 25:06.837
I think he did much to

25:08.302 --> 25:28.231
to stop that kind of room that gave so much emphasis to the cataloging and the preservation of the holdings that I have never encountered that room anymore.

25:28.532 --> 25:30.955
I don't know if it's abroad, I don't know if it's focused.

25:30.975 --> 25:33.499
Well, in a tournament we coined the phrase, he didn't really appear to be called the Ransom Syndrome.

25:33.817 --> 25:36.460
I don't remember that.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.442
Have you ever heard that say?

25:39.202 --> 25:40.063
No, I never have.

25:40.564 --> 25:43.246
I've heard about everything else that Ransom said.

25:43.266 --> 25:55.718
But at any rate, Ransom did have a lot of things sitting in boxes and crates for a while as he figured out what shape exactly the collection should take.

25:55.859 --> 25:59.282
And of course, as you know, you probably talked to Tom Staley.

25:59.302 --> 26:01.444
He was very

26:01.947 --> 26:14.266
I fell into, I think, some heavy criticism by people who felt and thought almost intrinsically or impulsively.

26:14.666 --> 26:30.570
I wasn't sure how I felt about that when I started my search, but from what I can tell from the correspondence, Branson was convinced

26:31.377 --> 26:43.768
that he had this one window in time through which he could reach and do this thing.

26:45.009 --> 26:47.911
He had a tremendous following among the alumni.

26:48.472 --> 26:55.578
He had the attention, the respectful attention in the state legislature.

26:55.598 --> 26:58.301
He had a very cooperative board of regents.

26:58.761 --> 27:01.063
There were people in the state, and I don't think I'm overly

27:01.870 --> 27:17.810
as we were doing it to say, we worshiped Harry Lentz, and then we had the embodiment of what the university education should be about.

27:18.871 --> 27:22.335
He represented learning for learning's sake.

27:22.355 --> 27:30.105
He was pure, learned wisdom, and he decided to act on those advantages in reality, and although he almost knew that it wouldn't last very long,

27:30.338 --> 27:31.560
Excuse me, just a second.

27:31.580 --> 27:32.621
What wouldn't last go on?

27:32.641 --> 27:36.887
The availability of the money, the availability of the materials?

27:37.769 --> 27:42.776
This rare coincidence of the damages that he had.

27:42.796 --> 27:58.438
I mean, he had oil prices doing very well, and the West Texas oil lands where the University was bringing this money in, and the Regents liked him and trusted him.

27:59.279 --> 28:07.071
And he was able to go out with those favorable conditions and the wide following that he had.

28:07.231 --> 28:11.398
And I think I was just about ready to say that people worshipped him.

28:11.418 --> 28:13.481
And he acted on that.

28:13.581 --> 28:17.227
He did something with those cards that he held.

28:17.247 --> 28:28.003
He settled them on this concept that the last thing we lacked here by entering the

28:28.642 --> 28:32.466
the great universities rather late.

28:32.486 --> 28:46.279
The last culminating thing that we lacked was a great research library, and he would talk about this through every forum where he was allowed, and he was a much invited speaker in those days.

28:46.439 --> 28:50.683
Air travel, of course, wasn't as convenient as it was going on.

28:50.703 --> 28:54.767
It was a very large state, but he did more than his share of

28:55.591 --> 29:06.863
talking to civic and alumni groups around the state, and everywhere he would mention this, and he just sold the entire state on it, sold people.

29:06.883 --> 29:18.696
I mean, it may sound rather normal to someone from Boston to think of telling this idea,

29:19.469 --> 29:23.555
He sold this idea to people who made their money in oil.

29:23.676 --> 29:28.243
He sold this idea to people who made their money in ranching.

29:28.263 --> 29:39.861
I mean, this is not an idea you would expect to come naturally to a state that is still rough around the edges like Texas was in the 1950s.

29:39.921 --> 29:42.886
But Texas also had a sense of destiny, too, and greatness.

29:42.906 --> 29:45.510
And he tapped into that and wrote several essays about

29:46.267 --> 29:50.453
what he called the counter-frontier.

29:50.534 --> 29:59.487
He felt there was a frontier, and then there was a kind of counter-frontier that had always been here.

29:59.507 --> 30:06.538
He's got an essay on this subject, but it was almost from the beginning.

30:06.558 --> 30:08.501
There had been this quest for knowledge and polish and cosmopolitan attitude.

30:08.521 --> 30:13.489
He reminded people about things that had been there all along, and fought certain stereotypes,

30:14.178 --> 30:26.052
and convinced, in some cases, I think stereotypical individuals who recognized the value to the state of having a different image abroad.

30:26.112 --> 30:30.778
This is a state that hadn't worked itself over much on the East or West Coast.

30:31.498 --> 30:34.462
Before he was done, he'd been given these monies.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.847
And so here's what he could be criticized for, I suppose.

30:38.867 --> 30:41.350
That is, they've had to sit down,

30:41.802 --> 30:46.126
under Decker-Turner's, but especially, I think, under Tom Staley's stewardship.

30:46.146 --> 30:51.311
We had to sit down and figure out, now, where exactly are we going with this library?

30:51.791 --> 30:54.594
What should be our collection development policies and so forth?

30:54.634 --> 30:56.756
I mean, we did certain things sort of in reverse here.

30:57.597 --> 31:06.325
Ransom went out and got a lot of books and manuscripts, and then we sat down and said, now, what do we have and what should become our strengths?

31:06.345 --> 31:11.590
Well, Tom Staley talked very ably about this in the speech he was going to give you.

31:11.992 --> 31:15.716
The point is, I don't hold this against Ransom.

31:15.736 --> 31:39.080
I think he had an intuition that it would not go on forever, that he had to act as quickly as possible, and so he simply went out and bought every large collection that was available to him at the time, and he even bought on a cup, and he didn't even have the money he would buy, because he was sure he could get the money eventually.

31:40.282 --> 31:41.543
And so this has led to some speculation.

31:41.692 --> 31:47.117
speculations, accusations about how exactly this... Can I ask you a question?

31:47.438 --> 31:49.520
Have you been able to document that he bought on the cuff?

31:50.200 --> 31:51.582
Is this reflected in the files?

31:51.802 --> 31:54.465
What kind of documents?

31:54.505 --> 32:00.350
Well, you've probably heard of the somewhat infamous House of LDS.

32:00.631 --> 32:03.493
That's my next question for you.

32:03.794 --> 32:08.138
I think that Ransom had so much to do with the

32:09.400 --> 32:20.672
the proprietor of that firm because me, David Feldman, was carrying them in the cup.

32:20.692 --> 32:22.233
He'd carry large some.

32:23.214 --> 32:26.958
Feldman trusted it eventually, asking them to be able to cover this.

32:26.978 --> 32:29.741
Was there any indication that there was interest involved, too?

32:33.005 --> 32:39.171
I don't think there was a set charge of interest, but I have no doubt that

32:39.826 --> 33:01.646
Sometimes, Ransom may have winked at paying just a little bit more for the next acquisition, other things he told me, because he remembered how gracious Rodman had been at putting his funds and waiting for that long opinion.

33:01.666 --> 33:09.073
A lot of Ransom's work was finished winning when he hadn't reached his hook dealership, because he was buying fast, and he was a very cumbersome apparatus

33:09.779 --> 33:15.926
How is this documented in the files?

33:15.946 --> 33:19.791
Are there actual agreements between the HSC and LDF?

33:22.174 --> 33:33.888
No, I have found letters in which Feldman says, this is what I will need for this collection.

33:34.468 --> 33:37.332
Does he also say you don't have to pay it right away?

33:37.352 --> 33:39.094
You have a year, a few years?

33:39.412 --> 33:42.475
It doesn't have to come out of this year's million dollars, but it could come out next year.

33:42.495 --> 33:55.028
Well, he'll hint that he would say earlier he could be paid the better, and ransom will arrive, and say, I may have a little trouble with this, but you'll get your money.

33:55.048 --> 33:58.091
And the next few months, my secretary always started the process of taking the money.

33:58.111 --> 34:02.656
If I wanted to see one or two examples of this, and believe me, I don't want to see any more of them with you.

34:02.836 --> 34:05.419
This is not my intention, but it is an interesting thing.

34:06.057 --> 34:07.480
aspect of the story.

34:07.560 --> 34:13.351
And you think they'd give me access to that?

34:15.816 --> 34:16.678
I think they will.

34:16.978 --> 34:22.870
If not, maybe Tom Staley will quote you something.

34:22.890 --> 34:27.238
He himself has looked at these things and used them in talks.

34:28.012 --> 34:29.454
Maybe save you some work for this.

34:29.474 --> 34:34.160
You know, I mean, this is part of the colorful history of the building of this collection, let's face it.

34:34.180 --> 34:35.222
And it worked.

34:35.242 --> 34:35.963
I mean, it worked.

34:35.983 --> 34:37.044
Look around us.

34:37.165 --> 34:38.707
It's here.

34:39.027 --> 34:47.919
We've got some materials that probably are not as valuable for our purposes as might be desired.

34:47.939 --> 34:54.548
In other words, they came as part of another, as part of the larger collection.

34:54.568 --> 34:57.192
There were things like this that I wish

34:57.593 --> 34:59.175
the money might .

34:59.796 --> 35:12.173
But at the same time, every time you see one of those letters from Feldman or anywhere else, you think, oh, golly, only $18,000?

35:12.193 --> 35:12.513
What's the deal?

35:12.533 --> 35:15.277
Like today's standards, sure.

35:15.417 --> 35:18.982
Only $18,000.

35:19.002 --> 35:24.630
So everything in retrospect looks like a bargain, and then

35:25.100 --> 35:35.711
you can't always be sure that it is things we weren't interested in very much in the 1950s and 1960s, minor novelists, minor poets, and so forth.

35:35.791 --> 35:46.922
Suddenly, the world turns around a few times, and now we're tremendously interested in obscure women writers in the late 19th century.

35:47.102 --> 35:50.486
We're extremely interested still in one another.

35:50.506 --> 35:52.668
So, who's to say exactly?

35:52.688 --> 35:53.689
He just saw his

35:54.513 --> 36:01.922
job as going out and spending that money as wisely as he could, as long as he could spend it.

36:01.942 --> 36:08.510
And later, directors here at the HRC will not have that privilege.

36:08.790 --> 36:15.318
I'm sure Thomas Bailey's budget is a fraction of what Ransom is reaching in today's dollars, too.

36:15.678 --> 36:24.148
In today's dollars, but Ransom just seemed to know that let's get this job done, let's get a lot of

36:24.382 --> 36:33.915
items in the collection, they would attract a lot of people here.

36:34.375 --> 36:46.992
And see, it was what brought me here originally and got me interested in joining the faculty, and there must be a number of other stories like mine.

36:47.012 --> 36:50.437
And my life as a scholar has been immensely enriched here by the casual visitors who come through to use the collections.

36:50.457 --> 36:51.418
There was a visitor here not long ago,

36:51.888 --> 37:02.479
Louisiana and using some Edgar Allan Poe materials.

37:02.499 --> 37:12.851
I have friends who come over from Texas and they'll use the collection and just see and talk to them.

37:12.871 --> 37:20.419
Often we arrange it so that while these business scholars from Rhode Island or California are here, we have to deliver a talk to the U.S.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.160
campus, so I'm glad someone's right.

37:21.180 --> 37:21.540
The vision's held.

37:22.718 --> 37:30.551
this did make us a part of the larger scholarly world.

37:30.571 --> 37:40.086
People are willing to pay expensive airfares and hotels to come here in more of the least excessive space.

37:40.336 --> 37:43.941
We couldn't get a direct FOIA.

37:44.382 --> 37:48.588
Well, what I meant was you don't just stop in Texas on your way somewhere else.

37:48.608 --> 37:52.974
It's not really on anybody's way anywhere else.

37:53.115 --> 37:58.743
It's an exhibition here in Maryland, Texas.

37:59.404 --> 38:07.335
If you've got the world's best collection of G.H.

38:07.355 --> 38:08.537
Lawrence materials or the finest collection

38:09.547 --> 38:19.980
of a place like George Bernard and Shaw, the people that are going to come from London.

38:20.340 --> 38:27.169
Well, I've mentioned this about three times today, but I've been kind of mildly amused to hear British accents all over the place.

38:27.209 --> 38:31.934
What do I want to study for countrymen?

38:33.116 --> 38:36.039
I have to travel across the big pond and come to Texas.

38:36.060 --> 38:38.102
I think it was in England where

38:38.791 --> 38:48.760
the resentment began to build against Texas as a result of a number of large purchases.

38:48.780 --> 38:57.268
I think it may be there where the label, the Grand Inquisitor, began to be applied to Harry Gramsci.

38:57.288 --> 39:06.036
And it was something that kind of clung to him and was often used, and rather almost proudly, in some of the newspaper editorials that celebrated his accomplishments.

39:06.056 --> 39:08.798
Others weren't so kind that they just stopped with the label

39:09.807 --> 39:33.438
There grew up a fear that Texas kind of represented a rapacious and wealthy United States that was going to harvest all these cultural icons and take them out of Europe and England.

39:33.458 --> 39:38.565
And Ransom began, toward the end of his career, to have to deal with some of the fallout from his

39:39.406 --> 40:04.478
He never, it seems to me, compared to today's public relations average, he never went to great lengths to announce and publicize these acquisitions in ways you see that might alarm or cause jealousy among the institutions.

40:04.499 --> 40:07.202
But they began to be talked about among their book dealers, and obviously if you bid at an auction,

40:07.621 --> 40:12.847
Here's a piece you might be able to help me out.

40:12.887 --> 40:14.929
This was in the New York Times, January 1, 1973.

40:15.030 --> 40:22.438
And this appears to be the first profile of the New York Times.

40:22.458 --> 40:29.627
I went through the Times Index, and finally the first time you find Harry Reitings under any details in this piece.

40:29.647 --> 40:32.650
And the occasion for this was the university's purchase of the

40:33.068 --> 40:43.297
the letters of the Mexican emperor Ferdinand and his Empress Carlaca, he wouldn't really say how Dr. Ransom got the letters widely coveted in Europe as well as North America.

40:43.317 --> 40:44.578
It's not exactly clear.

40:44.938 --> 40:50.683
Dr. Ransom is guided about revealing his methods of knowing when and where rare books and papers will become available.

40:50.703 --> 40:56.248
We learn that the Belgian royal family was about to release the letters and an alumnus got an option to stop the Ransom's explanation.

40:56.789 --> 41:00.051
The existence of these letters was not commonly known.

41:00.071 --> 41:02.974
I mean, this kind of adds to the mythology that does

41:03.545 --> 41:05.128
build up, and this is 783.

41:05.168 --> 41:06.951
How did you get built, by the way?

41:06.971 --> 41:08.894
Have you been able to set that out?

41:09.555 --> 41:10.657
No, I really don't know.

41:10.777 --> 41:11.979
Do you think that would be in the file?

41:12.700 --> 41:13.742
No, that would be in the file.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.265
What file do you think that would be in?

41:16.527 --> 41:19.311
You could probably look there.

41:19.472 --> 41:22.076
I think after 17 years, we could just .

41:22.236 --> 41:29.248
I would think someone like Henry Henderson could help you find a file called Maximilian Collection.

41:30.038 --> 41:30.558
It would be nice.

41:30.579 --> 41:31.599
It would be interesting.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.502
This was the occasion for the first big New York Times piece.

41:35.283 --> 41:40.808
And they really started to talk about the browsing that was going on internationally.

41:40.828 --> 41:49.216
I think Ransom and the subsequent HRC directors were a little appalled at the backlash of the experience from all this.

41:49.236 --> 41:53.740
That is, they felt it was hardly fair to complain about them.

41:53.800 --> 41:58.645
They hadn't had the funds and the history to develop

41:58.844 --> 42:16.367
one of the great collections of the Romantic and Victorian period, or certainly not the Middle Ages or Renaissance.

42:16.387 --> 42:28.243
But here they had gone out after what was available, late 19th century, primarily the 20th century works, and they had done it with resourcefulness and some imagination in trying to obtain the author's working notes

42:28.763 --> 42:29.464
and so forth.

42:29.724 --> 42:54.332
And for this, they were now being lambasted by various book dealers, those book dealers who didn't get the commissions, by various libraries who were second-best bids, and increasingly by academic scholars, newspaper commentators, and so forth.

42:54.802 --> 43:05.439
I'll read you another paragraph.

43:05.519 --> 43:18.801
As long ago as 1960, only two years after he set about to upgrade the research files at the University of Texas Library, Dr. Ransom began to anger collectors who are used to getting private libraries and collections of papers for small sums.

43:19.270 --> 43:26.699
As Dr. Ratcham said, the University of Texas did not have the drawing power of Harvard or Yale, and if it was to get materials, it had to buy them.

43:26.980 --> 43:30.344
But to anger, and this is the Times talking in 1973.

43:31.265 --> 43:45.042
I guess this kind of, they give a figure, by the way, since 1958, this is 73, he has added 45 million worth of papers and books and materials to the center, 30 million coming from gifts, so that would be 15 million

43:45.393 --> 43:46.575
which was appropriate.

43:46.655 --> 43:49.859
Do you have a feel at all for how much money has been satisfied?

43:49.879 --> 43:52.222
No, I go by the same newspaper clippings you have.

43:52.242 --> 43:58.251
I mean, I don't know that my instructor sat down and wrote a memo and said something.

43:58.371 --> 44:01.275
I spent this amount of money.

44:01.295 --> 44:05.080
I don't think the records are complete enough for me to try to edit that.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.342
I'm kind of gone by these ballparks for years.

44:06.362 --> 44:08.705
Are you familiar with this piece on the science writer?

44:08.785 --> 44:08.905
Yeah.

44:09.005 --> 44:10.808
I haven't seen it for a few months.

44:10.908 --> 44:13.632
Is that basically the first one that you could find?

44:13.672 --> 44:13.932
Yeah.

44:14.353 --> 44:15.214
And then there were

44:15.700 --> 44:17.182
Quite a number of the Times.

44:17.202 --> 44:22.650
But it's interesting.

44:22.670 --> 44:25.875
You really don't find his name even in the Times Index.

44:26.496 --> 44:32.685
He'd been at this for 10 years before the index even recognizes his existence.

44:32.705 --> 44:33.366
He really is.

44:33.406 --> 44:41.038
He may be an icon in Texas, but I think his name really needs your book, is what I'm saying.

44:42.921 --> 44:45.184
It is amazing that he hasn't really been written about

44:46.092 --> 44:49.937
outside of Texas.

44:49.997 --> 44:51.158
It's a known name, though.

44:51.398 --> 45:00.649
When I tell people in California that I'm writing about Terry Langton, it may be the association of the name of his institution.

45:00.669 --> 45:01.510
They have an idea.

45:01.570 --> 45:05.675
They know he's—they often think of him as a librarian.

45:05.715 --> 45:07.918
They rarely think of him in English, perhaps.

45:07.938 --> 45:13.825
Often as a librarian, and sometimes they know he was an administrator.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.947
He was more commonly associated with the librarian.

45:16.940 --> 45:23.886
I'm looking at one little piece of it.

45:23.906 --> 45:28.490
Do you have a feel for him, as a person, at this point?

45:28.510 --> 45:30.352
Yes, I do.

45:30.672 --> 45:31.533
Your judgment?

45:31.553 --> 45:37.078
Do you have feelings?

45:37.098 --> 45:37.638
Your assessment?

45:39.039 --> 45:39.320
Very private.

45:39.340 --> 45:43.643
I mean, it's not having a wish to function.

45:44.744 --> 45:46.626
I think his wife is very close, and often it's all over the weekend.

45:47.197 --> 46:04.808
They were only maybe two couples they ever regularly launched dinner with, and who would they have been?

46:04.828 --> 46:09.897
One couple was Dr. Clarence Klein, a professor of English, long-term English chairman, and Sass Newman.

46:10.467 --> 46:38.027
Not, um,

46:38.918 --> 46:42.321
not by any means of wily kind of administrator.

46:43.122 --> 46:43.563
Open.

46:46.486 --> 46:47.947
We'll wrap this up in two minutes.

46:49.409 --> 46:50.910
Oh, we're going to wrap.

46:50.930 --> 46:51.751
We're going to wrap up.

46:51.771 --> 46:52.832
Are they closing now?

46:52.952 --> 46:53.933
Okay.

46:56.516 --> 47:07.727
Open, generous with his time, known to almost everyone on campus, the letters of condolence when I'm going through their

47:08.112 --> 47:15.985
between heartfelt letters and custodians.

47:16.285 --> 47:23.917
He's on the staff.

47:23.937 --> 47:26.842
He's all ranked, as well as librarians, scholars, and high and high to get state politics and wealth.

47:26.862 --> 47:33.272
If I have any other questions for you, even if not tomorrow, but back in Massachusetts, is going to reach you?

47:33.292 --> 47:33.372
Yes.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.115
The residential member is probably the best that I know.

47:36.395 --> 47:43.085
What would be the best time to reach you, so as not to interrupt your writing?

47:43.306 --> 47:45.349
No, it's not a problem.

47:45.469 --> 47:48.334
I mean, this is what I'm writing about, so we know what I'm writing.

47:49.175 --> 47:59.070
Well, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you taking time from a project to come and help out, and this is very useful.

47:59.090 --> 48:03.077
And maybe I can get to see just a few pieces of some of these files that you mentioned.

48:03.097 --> 48:04.579
I hope that you can.

48:05.082 --> 48:12.488
I think we're going to see Kathy Henderson, aren't we?

48:12.529 --> 48:12.910
Sure.

48:13.211 --> 48:19.935
So that's great.
