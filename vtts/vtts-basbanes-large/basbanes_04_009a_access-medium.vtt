WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:07.458
We're talking to Philip Leighton.

00:08.860 --> 00:23.698
Looking at this essay that you wrote in 1991, and I will cite it, by the way, and so the publication, the journal is Le Debat, D-E-B-A-T, and I guess it's a monthly, and you said published in May of 1991, so that's how I would cite it.

00:24.199 --> 00:26.441
I'm not certain if it's monthly.

00:26.622 --> 00:27.823
It may be quarterly.

00:29.145 --> 00:31.067
I can check that out.

00:31.351 --> 00:35.600
I don't even think we have to, but it was published in May of 91, you would say.

00:36.301 --> 00:36.582
Okay.

00:36.602 --> 00:37.664
And what is the title?

00:39.588 --> 00:43.937
This is the title here, an analytical look at the Bibliothèque de France.

00:43.957 --> 00:45.360
Well, you know, it was in French.

00:48.074 --> 00:51.739
Okay, so what I would like to say then, we will cite it.

00:51.919 --> 00:56.205
It was published then, and then I have an English translation furnished by you.

00:56.366 --> 01:00.291
Is a copy of the English translation available anywhere?

01:00.311 --> 01:03.576
Have you deposited anywhere if anyone wants to see it?

01:03.696 --> 01:04.517
Because I will cite it.

01:05.138 --> 01:06.079
I'll be happy to put that.

01:06.099 --> 01:10.926
It is not deposited anywhere, so I have shared it with

01:12.273 --> 01:13.117
A few colleagues.

01:13.378 --> 01:19.770
Okay, but I can't say that a copy of the English translation was furnished to me by the author.

01:20.855 --> 01:21.237
Yes.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.317
I mean, you know, it's published.

01:23.357 --> 01:26.100
It's published in its public domain.

01:26.841 --> 01:27.762
Public information.

01:27.842 --> 01:28.723
Yeah, good.

01:28.743 --> 01:32.046
Okay, well, this is just business keeping here.

01:33.248 --> 01:35.570
Because I think it really should be cited.

01:36.291 --> 01:42.859
Well, obviously it's in French, and so far as I know, the translation is accurate.

01:42.879 --> 01:44.600
Which leads me to the next point.

01:45.061 --> 01:50.347
On the strength of this, I guess you were invited by the French government to come and take a look.

01:50.467 --> 01:51.308
Is that right?

01:52.790 --> 01:54.212
on the strength of this article?

01:54.232 --> 01:55.133
Well, yes.

01:55.533 --> 02:02.541
I would have to imagine that it was a two-sided sword.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.604
I suspect that they didn't want a sequel.

02:07.086 --> 02:15.435
I think that probably this report resulted in some heat in some quarters.

02:19.059 --> 02:20.080
And...

02:21.528 --> 02:28.940
So I was hired with the expectation that I would not write another such article.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.181
With the hope, shall we say.

02:30.322 --> 02:33.867
Yeah, I think that was the underlying principle.

02:34.268 --> 02:36.912
And did you write a sequel?

02:37.813 --> 02:39.356
No, I did not write a sequel.

02:39.376 --> 02:44.484
I did write a report for them, which they did in turn publish.

02:45.045 --> 02:45.746
They published it?

02:45.986 --> 02:46.507
Yeah.

02:46.527 --> 02:46.607
Hmm.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.583
Without telling me.

02:48.944 --> 02:49.505
No kidding.

02:49.525 --> 02:50.728
Which kind of surprised me.

02:50.748 --> 02:59.607
And I think that the nature of that publication was somewhat truncated.

02:59.667 --> 03:03.054
That is... They edited it.

03:03.074 --> 03:04.377
Yeah.

03:05.048 --> 03:06.510
and published it in French?

03:06.950 --> 03:07.190
Yes.

03:07.651 --> 03:16.661
So you really, I don't know how conversant you are in French, but you really didn't have an opportunity to see what they retained and what they excised.

03:16.681 --> 03:30.837
I had a colleague read it over and he gave me some sense of what they said and I said, which leads me to the conclusion that it was not 100% complete, but still...

03:31.593 --> 03:32.615
They were my words.

03:35.319 --> 03:45.714
Did they make a good faith attempt to, in your view, to implement a number of the suggestions that you made in this report?

03:49.760 --> 03:59.575
I can only guess that they considered all of the

04:00.584 --> 04:29.089
recommendations and suggestions not only in the report you have but the subsequent report you wrote and whatever they chose to pursue or not pursue was probably heavily influenced by the stage of the project which was clearly in motion and not to be stopped so it's probable that

04:30.048 --> 04:41.281
Many of the concerns that I have expressed really have not been addressed, and that's simply part of the beast.

04:41.301 --> 04:45.766
When you wrote this first report, how much did you spend time at the site?

04:45.966 --> 04:47.588
No, I had not seen it.

04:47.948 --> 04:50.731
So it was an evaluation based on the plans?

04:51.252 --> 04:57.439
It was an evaluation based upon a plan that...

04:58.921 --> 05:03.005
basically I received.

05:03.025 --> 05:10.391
And the material that I had may have been somewhat dated.

05:10.471 --> 05:16.957
In fact, that was one of the criticisms of that report was that I didn't have the most recent material.

05:17.057 --> 05:28.708
But I have to say that I subsequently saw the most recent material, and it did not markedly change from what I had seen earlier

05:29.279 --> 05:44.398
in my estimation, who I think the business of, as I recall, there was a reference room on one side of the building and a catalog room on another side or something like that.

05:44.839 --> 05:57.835
That changed either as a result or between the drawings that I have reviewed and the current

05:58.118 --> 06:00.817
arrangements.

06:00.837 --> 06:02.610
Of course, the catalog's all online now.

06:02.742 --> 06:09.410
When you think of it as a practical matter, here you have the equivalent of a billion-plus dollars.

06:09.550 --> 06:11.031
I guess it's $1.3 billion.

06:11.933 --> 06:19.101
And this thing is going ahead like firecrackers.

06:19.241 --> 06:24.807
Unlike the British experience, which goes 35 years, this thing is done in five.

06:25.548 --> 06:25.969
Yeah, it was amazing.

06:26.449 --> 06:29.012
And it was amazing in that respect.

06:29.172 --> 06:31.635
It's hard to spend that much money that fast.

06:31.615 --> 06:36.961
But there was really very little allowance to turn back.

06:37.021 --> 06:49.974
I mean, when you looked at this, I have to believe it was, when one considers the many problems for a library that were faced, their options were really very few, weren't they, I guess?

06:49.994 --> 06:50.635
Correct.

06:50.655 --> 07:00.205
And I think that one could arguably say that they got off on the wrong foot simply by the nature of

07:00.792 --> 07:17.911
the selection process of the competition, because once the competition was won, the philosophy of the design that the winner displayed was, in fact, the design.

07:18.111 --> 07:18.852
That was it.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.615
There was no appreciable change from that.

07:22.096 --> 07:27.302
There is a book which I purchased at the library, and if you've seen it, it's the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

07:27.962 --> 07:30.225
If you've seen that, Perrault's book,

07:30.779 --> 07:34.887
No, but... And it's got, you know, I've just opened it right here.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.210
Here's a picture.

07:36.230 --> 07:38.815
It's a photograph and it's in a gallery.

07:39.336 --> 07:46.750
It's charming, but it's four little L-shaped blocks of wood, you know, facing a few sprigs of spruce, you know.

07:47.612 --> 07:48.253
And that's it.

07:48.313 --> 07:51.319
That's the concept from there.

07:51.299 --> 07:52.240
He's a charming man.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.582
I'm sure he is.

07:54.802 --> 07:56.504
I don't even have to interview him.

07:56.604 --> 08:01.108
He's quoted at length in this book where they ask him the tough questions.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.612
His answers speak for themselves.

08:04.672 --> 08:08.656
I can't imagine that I would get any different answer if I would speak to him myself.

08:09.376 --> 08:17.624
In a way, I really can't fault him.

08:18.865 --> 08:19.686
The design

08:20.358 --> 08:25.747
basically was not influenced with a proper program.

08:25.827 --> 08:28.692
They actually wrote the program after the building was designed.

08:29.714 --> 08:37.506
It wasn't influenced by any appreciable expertise from the library world.

08:38.789 --> 08:46.922
So he was basically creating something with pretty limited information.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.398
And having never done a library before.

08:49.618 --> 08:51.942
Yeah, so... He's 36 years old.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.345
You really can't fully blame him.

08:54.445 --> 09:08.466
He came up with a very, you know, very interesting and elegant concept of putting the, they call it the nation's patrimony, you know, the great books of the nation up where people can see them, where they're at the light for the eye.

09:09.427 --> 09:13.213
But clearly that was a concept that couldn't,

09:13.970 --> 09:17.177
Have you visited the library at all?

09:18.379 --> 09:18.820
Right.

09:18.880 --> 09:25.473
What's your sense of how it's going now?

09:29.081 --> 09:32.147
Yeah, what's your sense of how it's going now, do you think?

09:33.342 --> 09:54.628
In your report here, for instance, you talk about the General Forum and the Four Towers and the obvious anxiety over the fact that, over the possibility that these books could be cooked, you know, and that you have these shades that are now put in to protect them, but now you have to have all of the sophisticated air conditioning.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.835
It's much better to be in a cave like at the British Library, you know, for all the people

10:00.815 --> 10:03.859
Although perhaps not a cave right next to the river.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.942
But then that's right.

10:06.062 --> 10:13.312
And then you look at the schematic in this book, the lower level of the library is below the sin.

10:13.973 --> 10:14.594
Quite a bit below.

10:14.955 --> 10:15.796
Quite a bit below.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.780
And we're talking about a river that's next door.

10:19.721 --> 10:29.455
And I think perhaps in part as a result of what I wrote and what I'm sure others wrote, they ended up putting many more

10:30.093 --> 10:34.939
books in the lower levels of the building than perhaps they had originally planned.

10:34.959 --> 10:45.951
And indeed, the floor plate of one of the tower floors is not very large, even with compact shelving, which they were planning to use.

10:45.971 --> 10:46.872
Which you're right about here.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.294
Did they in fact use it, do you know?

10:48.955 --> 10:54.761
I assume they had to, to get the capacity they were looking for, but I don't know.

10:55.642 --> 10:58.986
I was told that the tower was designed for compact shelving.

10:59.489 --> 11:04.717
See, they never took me into the... I mean, I went to people's offices on the tower, which were very small, by the way.

11:05.338 --> 11:08.502
But the tower floor is not very big, and no contact shelving.

11:08.883 --> 11:14.090
Each floor is not going to hold a huge collection.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.354
Is there a cautionary tale here, in your view?

11:17.836 --> 11:19.498
Would you go so far as to say that?

11:19.899 --> 11:20.860
Well, sure.

11:20.880 --> 11:27.370
I think there are numerous threads, but perhaps the initial key is...

11:28.126 --> 11:53.425
that where the great library or any library or any project is being planned from the perspective of competitive design, that there be some ground rules laid to establish the functional design

11:54.620 --> 12:21.364
requirements of whatever that facility is, in this case a library, and that the ground rules would have the blessing of a well-established member of the profession, library profession, and that the jury would include meaningful representation of the library rule.

12:22.185 --> 12:24.407
The jury in this case did have a librarian

12:25.113 --> 12:29.642
Billington?

12:29.662 --> 12:30.343
Was he on the jury?

12:30.503 --> 12:31.445
Billington.

12:31.465 --> 12:32.107
Yeah, but you know what?

12:32.187 --> 12:33.109
He's not a librarian.

12:34.411 --> 12:34.652
Uh-huh.

12:35.132 --> 12:37.437
I'm in this very same chapter.

12:38.860 --> 12:39.681
He's a historian.

12:39.902 --> 12:44.691
I mean, he taught at Princeton for years, and in fact, he follows in the tradition of

12:44.671 --> 12:48.976
of having a librarian of Congress who quite pointedly is not a librarian.

12:49.196 --> 12:53.721
Okay, well, then that was the token librarian, and he wasn't even a librarian.

12:53.781 --> 12:56.224
Yeah, no, he's a great scholar and a historian.

12:56.284 --> 13:08.337
He's written about Russian history, and he came to the Library of Congress from Princeton, where he'd written a number of books, but like Archibald McLeish before him, who was a poet, or, you know what I'm saying?

13:08.617 --> 13:12.822
And I was told, although this may be...

13:13.679 --> 13:15.983
pure rumor and not accurate.

13:16.003 --> 13:24.177
I was told that he basically said precious little about the needs of the library in the jury context.

13:25.179 --> 13:31.570
So his contribution as a librarian was

13:33.592 --> 13:38.120
And let me also point out, when was this competition done?

13:38.140 --> 13:38.801
87, 88?

13:39.002 --> 13:42.648
Yeah, well, Billington was appointed in 87.

13:42.748 --> 13:44.151
I mean, he knows a lot now.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.113
I've interviewed him.

13:45.133 --> 13:45.974
He's a lovely man.

13:46.996 --> 13:49.601
But I interviewed him 12 years.

13:49.621 --> 13:54.068
He perhaps was put into a... Again, he's probably not to be blamed.

13:54.109 --> 13:56.072
He was put into a circumstance that was...

13:56.963 --> 13:59.385
Yeah, it was unfortunate for him.

13:59.666 --> 14:13.559
I mean, Mitterrand was doing a, and there's no question about it, you read it in this book, this is quite pointedly intended to be a monument, which does bring me to a quote, by the way, from our previous interview, and I'll read it to you.

14:14.520 --> 14:21.787
Over the last 40 or 50 years, a pragmatic approach has been in vogue that argues that you ought to be able to do anything with the given space.

14:21.907 --> 14:26.532
I believe our culture may be moving toward a greater interest in the kind of design that tells a story

14:26.832 --> 14:32.062
I think the whole concept of storytelling has to do with generating a logic that goes beyond the technology.

14:33.325 --> 14:34.407
That's a quote.

14:34.427 --> 14:44.046
And then at Tobias' storyline, this is not a quote, but this is me, developed by the architect Dominique Pirro, is enormous, strikingly symbolic, and clearly expressed with the nation's patrimony.

14:44.086 --> 14:46.731
That's the word, as you point out, they always use over there.

14:46.711 --> 14:56.561
contained within four glass towers, shaped to resemble four books, opened inward and embracing a lush garden of spruce trees transplanted fully grown from a forest in Ruan.

14:56.581 --> 14:58.122
I mean, it's a great concept.

14:58.142 --> 14:58.943
It's so bold.

14:59.644 --> 15:02.426
I'm not sure they ended up with spruce trees.

15:02.527 --> 15:02.987
What are they?

15:04.468 --> 15:06.911
You know, I'm not sure.

15:07.031 --> 15:07.912
Well, you know what?

15:07.932 --> 15:08.793
I've got the book here.

15:08.813 --> 15:13.397
I wrote in spruce, but they might be Norway pines or something like that, too.

15:13.898 --> 15:14.298
I don't know.

15:14.318 --> 15:15.199
I haven't seen them before.

15:15.922 --> 15:19.928
Oh, it's quite a thing to see, but they won't let you walk down there either, you know?

15:19.948 --> 15:24.714
I mean, it's my wife and I. We were there, and you walk up these huge stairs.

15:24.734 --> 15:25.856
You don't know where the hell you are.

15:26.397 --> 15:27.678
You know, you don't know how to get in.

15:28.480 --> 15:37.793
If you're disabled, or if you're... You walk up, and then you go down, and it's all to make this statement.

15:39.315 --> 15:42.059
And I'll tell you, that wood, you can slip on it, you know, in the rain.

15:42.379 --> 15:45.203
I mean, it's...

15:45.183 --> 15:45.844
I don't know.

15:46.686 --> 15:47.668
I see the story.

15:48.329 --> 16:01.835
I think that, in fact, the building... My guess is that the building is a very interesting building to visit and probably will continue to be so for many generations.

16:04.761 --> 16:07.326
But it's somewhat at the expense of it.

16:07.593 --> 16:17.983
Yeah, but you also point out that even with the shutters and the towers, that's no guarantee that you're going to protect the books.

16:18.003 --> 16:18.444
That's right.

16:18.984 --> 16:22.067
Because glass is, you know, glassed.

16:22.087 --> 16:30.535
And also even with redundant water protection systems, there's no guarantee that they're not going to have a foot on the lower levels, and indeed they have had one.

16:30.555 --> 16:31.056
Is that right?

16:32.918 --> 16:33.178
Yeah.

16:33.198 --> 16:34.579
Within the last couple of months.

16:34.599 --> 16:35.440
No kidding.

16:36.247 --> 16:41.472
So what happens when you see these stories of strikes and fistfights and scholars?

16:41.992 --> 16:46.937
I think that part of that is perhaps the French way.

16:49.079 --> 17:06.034
But I can also imagine that that setting is frustrating for the employee who feels a genuine sense of purpose and desire to do the very best.

17:06.875 --> 17:10.421
It's hard sometimes.

17:12.124 --> 17:18.775
You know, you do mention that presidential libraries, I hadn't thought of that, are interesting examples of libraries that deal with tourist traffic.

17:19.736 --> 17:21.840
I mean, these are the Jefferson Building.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.162
See, the L.C.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.527
is a, you know, that's a big tourist attraction, too.

17:26.547 --> 17:30.574
But then all the business now is done over at the Madison Building, you know, basically, right?

17:31.736 --> 17:31.836
Yeah.

17:31.816 --> 17:35.420
There's probably still some business done in Jefferson.

17:35.440 --> 17:35.980
Oh, yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.481
Oh, there is.

17:37.042 --> 17:39.144
They keep the tourists.

17:39.164 --> 17:46.992
It's pretty hard to get into the reading room now, whereas it used to be easy.

17:47.012 --> 17:48.854
They take you to some balcony overlooking.

17:48.874 --> 17:49.014
Right.

17:49.755 --> 17:53.039
And the exhibition is over at Madison, too.

17:53.079 --> 17:54.640
You see the exhibitions over there.

17:55.641 --> 17:59.305
Do you have any comments to make on the St.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.827
Pancras Library?

18:01.769 --> 18:03.651
The British Library, the New British Library.

18:06.534 --> 18:15.522
I only know of it in a rather secondary way.

18:15.682 --> 18:24.591
My sense is that the mass of that library makes much more sense for the National Library.

18:25.692 --> 18:30.156
I think that they have had some problems that have been unfortunate.

18:31.351 --> 18:33.734
with their compact shelving and other systems.

18:36.457 --> 18:48.332
But, you know, one has to accept the fact that libraries are complex projects and that there will be almost a given that there are some problems.

18:48.352 --> 18:56.262
But I think the pancreas in general has a more rational perspective

18:57.507 --> 19:04.501
It does seem to have had input from librarians, too.

19:05.723 --> 19:13.117
I mean, the rounded corners, the way... I mean, the readers seem to have been... People seem to have been thinking about the readers over there.

19:14.059 --> 19:15.482
I was really...

19:17.504 --> 19:19.508
Uh, very, very much impressed by that.

19:19.588 --> 19:21.732
And that was two years ago, you know, before it opened.

19:21.792 --> 19:27.583
I said, this thing's, this thing is getting a bad rap on the British, you know, from Prince Charles and everybody else.

19:27.603 --> 19:30.488
I mean, he's looking for an architectural statement.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.694
Well, of course, the British are just like the French.

19:33.875 --> 19:37.702
They like their old, their old digs.

19:37.722 --> 19:38.263
And, uh,

19:38.716 --> 19:40.238
And change is difficult.

19:40.258 --> 19:40.459
Yeah.

19:40.619 --> 19:47.690
And it does, I have to think, I have to say, I think it looks perhaps a bit too oriental, too, you know, but that's just taste here.

19:49.353 --> 19:49.994
Yeah, right, yeah.

19:50.134 --> 19:52.338
But... You know, that's easy to criticize.

19:52.358 --> 19:58.287
You know, and... One could say to Dr. France that it's a little bit too much polished chrome in glass.

19:58.427 --> 19:59.489
Really, you know.

20:00.430 --> 20:04.336
And in some ways, that's kind of a harsh environment.

20:04.497 --> 20:06.580
It's going to be an acoustic problem and probably...

20:07.268 --> 20:15.253
It is interesting though that you have these projects come along at a time when

20:16.837 --> 20:25.410
When people are talking about law, and then you read this, you read in this little pamphlet put out by the British Library, which is terrific.

20:25.490 --> 20:30.197
It was Sir Kinney, I guess, he was the head of the library board.

20:30.237 --> 20:39.071
And again, he repeats the criticism that a lot of people were saying after 20 years into this thing, you know, maybe we're building a building that's not going to be needed.

20:39.111 --> 20:41.815
Everything's going to be digitized, blah, blah, blah.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.403
And yet you point out that libraries are growing.

20:44.423 --> 20:45.504
They will continue to grow.

20:46.626 --> 20:52.674
As David Bradbury told me at the British Library, it would cost 50 billion pounds to digitize every book in the library.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.817
And that's never going to happen.

20:55.017 --> 20:57.020
And the cost of labor isn't going to go down either.

20:58.702 --> 21:06.112
But it is interesting that the great public works projects of France and Great Britain, towards the end of the century, turn out to be libraries.

21:07.754 --> 21:09.777
The French, and I'm not certain...

21:09.976 --> 21:25.533
what fraction of the $1.3 billion this may have entailed, but the French project was to include a fairly massive digitization program, and I believe that was part of the cost.

21:25.553 --> 21:27.536
I'm not certain.

21:27.556 --> 21:28.637
I'm able to figure that out.

21:28.897 --> 21:37.907
Yeah, my understanding, I did talk to somebody, the guy who heads that, and he gave me a bunch of publications in French that I can't read, but...

21:38.090 --> 21:53.314
They have apparently backed off quite markedly from what I've heard and read, in part because they discovered that the transmission of this material over Minitel or what have you...

21:54.256 --> 21:57.540
is slow enough that people don't like it.

21:58.441 --> 22:04.308
Well, plus, and the preservation factor is still unknown.

22:04.528 --> 22:05.669
You know, we still don't know.

22:06.250 --> 22:17.523
As I understand it, the French are working on supposedly a deacidification, mass deacidification formula that they've been very quiet about.

22:17.583 --> 22:20.787
You know, the Germans really seem to be leading the way in this.

22:21.526 --> 22:25.310
But everybody says the French are going to come up with something.

22:25.610 --> 22:38.202
And I think they've been working on this as well, you know, to deacidify their existing collections as artifacts, not to convert them into digital forms or even microfilm forms.

22:39.624 --> 22:40.625
They've been doing a lot of that.

22:40.645 --> 22:45.750
Years back, I think it was FMC had a formula that looked very promising.

22:47.231 --> 22:49.153
For some reason, they...

22:50.078 --> 22:52.303
Basically dropped it, and I don't know the reason.

22:52.323 --> 22:53.104
Who's FMC?

22:54.187 --> 22:58.055
Well, FMC stands for Food Machinery Corporation.

22:58.075 --> 22:58.355
Oh, really?

22:58.376 --> 22:58.977
It's a company?

22:59.498 --> 22:59.859
Pardon me?

22:59.879 --> 23:00.620
It's a company, or?

23:00.660 --> 23:02.624
It's a very large company.

23:03.587 --> 23:03.847
Yeah.

23:04.829 --> 23:08.577
Well, LC basically farms out to a guy in Pennsylvania.

23:09.333 --> 23:12.839
who I guess used to preserve or do something with telephone poles.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.122
Have you heard that story?

23:14.743 --> 23:14.863
No.

23:14.983 --> 23:15.925
Oh, it's a great story.

23:16.025 --> 23:16.926
The name was Spatz.

23:16.967 --> 23:17.788
I'm writing about him.

23:19.110 --> 23:25.422
But LC actually had contracted some big company, and they were testing it out in Maryland at a NASA.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.988
This is some years, 10 years or so years ago, and the damn thing blew up.

23:29.268 --> 23:30.310
Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with that.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.995
And they had an explosion, you know, and that was the end of that one.

23:32.975 --> 23:36.299
Exactly.

23:37.060 --> 23:38.021
That's exactly right.

23:38.281 --> 23:46.971
Then there's the, is it, I want to say, Smith?

23:46.991 --> 23:47.512
Wito?

23:48.433 --> 23:48.894
I don't know.

23:48.914 --> 23:50.395
Dick Smith is his name, I think.

23:50.636 --> 23:51.096
I don't know.

23:51.817 --> 24:02.830
He's basically doing the same thing for the Canadian National Archives, using basically, I think,

24:03.569 --> 24:06.832
calcium carbonate.

24:06.852 --> 24:19.024
When we spoke the other day, you made a comment on the San Francisco Public Library, and maybe you'd be kind enough to repeat it now, that you think that maybe that Dallin has had a bad rap up there.

24:19.745 --> 24:21.747
Well, yeah.

24:23.669 --> 24:30.015
I think that if you accept Dallin's philosophy that the project was to be

24:31.126 --> 24:50.073
a public library and specifically not a research library, then many of the aspects of the San Francisco public that have been severely criticized really aren't fair game.

24:50.313 --> 24:55.761
And in a way, the building has been a pretty major success.

24:55.901 --> 24:57.403
Their use rates have gone up.

24:58.177 --> 25:26.968
at a far higher rate than anybody anticipated which is part of their problem and it's really I find it quite a lovely building to simply explore now that may not be exactly what some critics would feel a library should be but it gets you into the library and you might

25:27.708 --> 25:31.094
become a patron as a result.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.217
If I lived in San Francisco, I probably would.

25:34.299 --> 25:46.619
And indeed, the queues that occurred where you signed up for cards were quite long, for quite a long time.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.041
They may still be long.

25:48.061 --> 25:52.669
Yeah, well, I was there very early in the cycle, and they were pretty long, you know.

25:52.987 --> 25:59.975
Now, you know, one can be critical of some detail, I think, the entry.

25:59.995 --> 26:02.277
Parts of the entry, I think, work quite well.

26:02.297 --> 26:09.105
I mean, bringing entrances from three sides of the building to a single control point, I think, works well.

26:10.907 --> 26:15.091
The control point itself does not work so well.

26:15.151 --> 26:20.277
The fact that they have to have a person standing or directing traffic

26:21.202 --> 26:26.729
is indicative of a problem that really wasn't quite solved.

26:26.750 --> 26:32.637
I think that the circulation booths are an interesting concept.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.385
The queuing for those booths wasn't really worked out very well.

26:39.246 --> 26:46.636
The communication between the booth and other functions in the library is weak.

26:46.676 --> 26:50.061
The ability to bring a backup person from behind the scenes

26:50.463 --> 26:59.172
quickly is probably not as easy as it would be with a traditional circulation desk with workspace behind.

26:59.192 --> 27:11.704
But it was a bold and interesting concept, and it'll be interesting to see how it matures.

27:13.205 --> 27:18.951
I think that I'm concerned about some of the

27:20.213 --> 27:32.950
specialness of the design, little pretty carefully designed tables for computer terminals for the catalog.

27:33.891 --> 27:49.191
You know, the time is here for basically when catalogs are online rather than, I'm sorry, are web-based rather than being sort of sold

27:49.981 --> 27:55.950
solely connected to a particular terminal so that you can access the catalog basically from any computer.

27:55.970 --> 27:57.232
That's right.

27:57.252 --> 27:58.393
I do it all the time.

27:58.413 --> 28:02.940
Things may become outdated fairly quickly.

28:03.641 --> 28:18.503
But these are pretty trivial criticisms, I think, but perhaps the most severe from my perspective is the need to have a staff member entry all the time to make it work.

28:19.411 --> 28:21.394
So your new book is coming out next year?

28:21.434 --> 28:23.517
No, it's coming out this year.

28:23.537 --> 28:24.057
Oh, this year.

28:24.718 --> 28:25.119
Excellent.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.924
That means I'll have a chance to look at it before my book goes in.

28:29.805 --> 28:30.346
I don't know.

28:30.386 --> 28:33.790
It's due out in August or September.

28:33.851 --> 28:36.795
I just read the advertisement and it said September.

28:36.815 --> 28:37.375
Oh, that's great.

28:37.976 --> 28:46.768
There'll be plenty of time for me not only to cite it, but I'm turning in my manuscript in August, but there'll be three or four months to do changes, you know.

28:46.748 --> 28:52.533
Well, I wouldn't wish it upon you as bedtime reading, but... That's my job.

28:53.854 --> 28:54.214
Guess what?

28:54.275 --> 28:55.416
It is my bedtime reading.

28:56.136 --> 28:58.939
What is the fundamental approach in this edition?

28:59.559 --> 29:05.304
What is most striking in the development of libraries that you've had to take into account in this edition?

29:06.525 --> 29:10.329
I mean, I could make an assumption what it probably is, but I'd like to hear you say it.

29:10.349 --> 29:16.654
Obviously, the pervasive nature of technology is a key

29:17.343 --> 29:25.814
I think that another aspect is the effect of ADA on design.

29:27.577 --> 29:28.158
Now, what is that?

29:28.538 --> 29:31.823
The Americans with Disabilities Act.

29:32.143 --> 29:33.205
Okay, yeah.

29:33.285 --> 29:46.843
Which many of the very frugal, and I don't necessarily mean that in a negative way, but many of the very frugal characteristics of Metcalf trying to

29:47.245 --> 29:54.094
weaned the greatest use out of each square foot basically are no longer possible because of ADA.

29:56.336 --> 30:02.685
So that the same functionality is taking more space than it did in Metcalf's era.

30:03.926 --> 30:07.090
And that, I hope, is reflected.

30:07.110 --> 30:14.940
I think that one of the criticisms of one of our readers of the second edition was that we spent too much time on earthquakes.

30:15.123 --> 30:16.465
Yeah, right.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.251
I've come to the conclusion that that person is wrong.

30:20.271 --> 30:22.755
Well, look at San Francisco, for instance.

30:26.261 --> 30:33.653
While we haven't really added anything in that area, I'm pleased to say that it's still well covered.

30:35.816 --> 30:42.447
We spent a little more paper on...

30:43.304 --> 30:51.616
Compact storage technologies, not a lot, but its presence is a little greater than it was in the last edition.

30:51.656 --> 31:03.474
I think that the notion of storage facilities, particularly for research libraries, will become more and more prevalent.

31:05.176 --> 31:11.826
There's even an illustration of one such facility that's

31:12.650 --> 31:19.017
commonly called the Harvard model, which is an order-picker system.

31:19.037 --> 31:19.277
Right.

31:19.337 --> 31:23.061
That's the off-site storage, which I have in my book, by the way.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.864
I went out there and wrote a little thing on it.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.107
I just do a physical description of it.

31:28.187 --> 31:33.633
Now, that general design is appearing all around.

31:34.214 --> 31:36.236
Well, they come to Harvard on a regular basis.

31:36.756 --> 31:37.617
I believe so.

31:37.637 --> 31:40.180
In fact, I think they've got a little videotape that I want to get.

31:40.781 --> 31:41.381
Have you seen it?

31:41.642 --> 31:41.982
Yes.

31:42.755 --> 31:43.856
Is it worth my seeing?

31:44.757 --> 31:45.438
Pardon me?

31:45.498 --> 31:47.320
Is it worth my getting and seeing, do you think?

31:47.561 --> 31:49.603
Oh, I think so, but it really doesn't tell you much.

31:49.623 --> 31:51.125
It doesn't tell me anything I don't already know.

31:51.345 --> 31:51.806
That's right.

31:52.607 --> 31:54.890
What you really want to know is what's the cost.

31:54.950 --> 31:58.934
Well, they tell me $2 million for each one.

31:59.755 --> 32:01.558
Yeah, but what's the cost to operate it?

32:01.918 --> 32:03.140
Oh, that's a whole other story.

32:03.340 --> 32:08.526
Yeah, because each thing has to be uniquely identified in order to find it again, I think.

32:09.181 --> 32:16.769
If they buff it, they've lost it, and apparently they feel that they have a very good record of doing this accurately.

32:16.789 --> 32:21.695
Yeah, they gave me their figures, by the way, and if you believe them, they're flawless.

32:22.916 --> 32:30.244
Well, they may be close to me, because I think they do have multiple checks, but this is not without cost.

32:30.264 --> 32:33.147
Oh, but Harvard, too, who can afford it more than Harvard?

32:33.532 --> 32:34.613
Well, yeah.

32:34.894 --> 32:40.822
How many institutions do have made a commitment to maintaining their collections?

32:40.882 --> 32:41.884
You know, there aren't that many.

32:43.145 --> 32:47.251
Oh, I think you may be wrong.

32:47.652 --> 32:57.786
And particularly if you look at research universities, colleges, yeah, they're not maintaining their collections.

32:57.826 --> 33:02.492
But research universities, the cost to simply deselect something

33:03.097 --> 33:10.626
is simply outrageous when it comes to, you know, removal of selection.

33:10.646 --> 33:11.507
What do you mean?

33:11.607 --> 33:22.259
The cost is... Well, the cost of deselecting would include making the decision that something is not going to be useful in the future, which may involve faculty.

33:22.580 --> 33:24.002
Which it does at Harvard.

33:24.122 --> 33:25.623
It's right there written down.

33:25.663 --> 33:27.566
I've got the regs on that, you know.

33:28.086 --> 33:30.049
And faculty time is not cheap.

33:30.329 --> 33:32.091
And then there's the records change.

33:33.016 --> 33:42.625
And the book itself may have to be, you know, altered in order to get it out of circulation, stamped, what have you.

33:42.645 --> 33:46.609
Maybe they even destroy it or they sell it or something.

33:47.289 --> 33:52.934
If they can sell it, it's going to be at, you know... Scrap paper cost.

33:53.155 --> 33:53.775
Just about.

33:54.456 --> 33:54.876
Yeah.

33:55.537 --> 34:02.263
But that cost, particularly the decision process, can be quite expensive.

34:03.104 --> 34:10.174
I've heard one collections person, Paul Mosier, do you know him?

34:10.294 --> 34:12.417
No, I've heard the name, but I don't know.

34:13.218 --> 34:13.659
Where is he?

34:14.299 --> 34:15.461
University of Pennsylvania.

34:15.481 --> 34:15.942
Yeah, okay.

34:17.123 --> 34:29.020
I've heard him say that he would not be surprised at the cost for the decision to deselect something as much as $50 a volume, or $50 a title, I should say.

34:29.040 --> 34:29.220
Wow.

34:30.061 --> 34:30.542
Yeah.

34:30.562 --> 34:32.925
So maybe it's easier just to keep it someplace.

34:33.192 --> 34:46.312
Yeah, whereas the cost for the Harvard model storage system is probably, particularly for the initial facility cost, is probably less than $3 of volume.

34:46.332 --> 34:46.653
Right.

34:46.673 --> 34:49.678
Or a tenth the cost of simply deciding to get rid of it.

34:50.098 --> 34:51.801
And that's a number they gave me, by the way.

34:51.821 --> 34:53.784
$3 of volume.

34:53.804 --> 34:56.027
Yeah, it might even be two.

34:56.047 --> 34:59.773
Yeah, the thing that that does not include is the continuing operation.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.596
That's right, the labor and the...

35:02.285 --> 35:03.727
and the support system.

35:03.767 --> 35:07.472
But now another attack that has been taken is Cornell.

35:08.793 --> 35:15.061
They are not, you know, they're a major five-star university in research and, you know, terrific.

35:15.782 --> 35:20.388
And so they're not about to get into the situation of wholesale dumping of their collections.

35:20.428 --> 35:29.760
But they have decreed that as of the year 2000, there will only be five million books ever kept on the central campus.

35:29.993 --> 35:37.281
Anything else will go out to what they call the Apple Orchid, where they have a Harvard model off-site storage.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.823
I think that's rational.

35:40.244 --> 35:41.265
Yeah.

35:41.285 --> 35:42.826
But it's not getting rid of it.

35:42.866 --> 35:49.934
The decision to put it into off-site storage is reversible, and that's the key.

35:50.154 --> 35:53.858
And being that it's reversible, it can be done much cheaper.

35:54.007 --> 35:54.548
That's right.

35:55.089 --> 35:59.299
But then let me just finish with what their attitude is, though, in terms of growing the collection.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.753
For the most part, they have a policy, and this is their phrase, that they call phased deterioration.

36:05.773 --> 36:06.475
Have you ever heard that?

36:07.938 --> 36:08.179
No.

36:08.199 --> 36:12.268
And what that is is that basically you have a book that's a brittle book.

36:12.670 --> 36:17.500
and that we have decided that we're not going to make any heroic efforts to save it.

36:18.142 --> 36:21.188
We'll give it a comfortable place to sleep and it will die a natural death.

36:21.809 --> 36:24.275
And that's how they're going to weed the collection, you know?

36:24.756 --> 36:31.911
Well, then if somebody comes to need it, they may discover that it has some importance and they may take steps to...

36:32.330 --> 36:36.054
Right, but that's really not about to happen, I don't think.

36:36.094 --> 36:40.218
It may happen one out of a hundred.

36:40.318 --> 36:50.608
Once a decision has been made, these are always, as you know, books that are in the middle, not books of great rarity or great significance or high circulation volumes.

36:50.648 --> 36:52.470
These are the books that nobody takes out.

36:52.570 --> 36:57.375
And you have a statistic in here, which I think is pretty interesting, that you say that the...

36:58.030 --> 37:06.499
in your paper that I guess if it's assumed that the average item circulates once every 12 years, is that a figure that somebody puts out like the ALA or?

37:07.440 --> 37:25.540
No, but it's a figure that I've kind of always used in a relatively low circulation and I think that it can be borne out as being in the right sort of general ballpark and not be one every

37:26.212 --> 37:38.472
10 years or one every 15 years, but from my experience, that would qualify for what one normally speaks of as low circulation.

37:39.213 --> 37:44.201
But even at that rate, and I probably made this point, that's quite a number of books that are moving in and out.

37:44.221 --> 37:44.461
Sure.

37:44.642 --> 37:49.249
Well, you say about 2.5 items circulated each day in each aisle, you know.

37:50.174 --> 38:05.550
But at some libraries, and we're not talking institutional, academic libraries, not research libraries, but I've heard figures thrown out to indicate that if a book isn't used in five years, it's a prime candidate for being tossed.

38:06.431 --> 38:11.076
Well, if it's a public library, that's definitely the case.

38:11.096 --> 38:11.937
And there you go, right?

38:12.097 --> 38:15.301
In fact, they'd like to see it used twice a year as a minimum.

38:15.521 --> 38:16.001
Is that right?

38:16.062 --> 38:16.502
Yeah.

38:16.887 --> 38:26.398
And with computers now giving you the ability to track usage, you know, books are in jeopardy of being tossed if they're not used.

38:26.418 --> 38:36.169
And I would have to say for a college library that might be a reasonable algorithm, but for a research library I think it has great risk.

38:36.189 --> 38:45.139
Oh, I think it's fraught with great... And even in a college library it would be nice to have

38:45.929 --> 38:54.057
some seed of material that's unusual that students could kind of discover.

38:54.718 --> 38:58.081
So what was the crux of the big firestorm up at Berkeley?

38:58.441 --> 39:00.884
Now, they're a great research library.

39:01.384 --> 39:06.550
Were they grooming the collection or just not adding to it with the same gusto that they had been?

39:08.031 --> 39:11.695
You know, I'm not sure that I'm aware of the firestorm you're speaking of.

39:11.755 --> 39:15.058
I know they've had serious...

39:15.410 --> 39:26.448
financial limitations, and there have been a number of key staff that have taken whatever golden parachute... Yeah, well, Peter Lyman stepped down.

39:27.109 --> 39:36.625
Yeah, and Lyman, I think he's a...

39:39.170 --> 39:45.664
He probably leans toward technology, the solution, the kind of CEO.

39:46.445 --> 39:56.166
And I think there's probably enough of a body of traditional skill at Berkeley that that probably just doesn't.

39:56.888 --> 39:57.769
Is that right?

39:57.790 --> 39:58.090
Yeah.

39:58.150 --> 40:01.616
No, there was quite a bit written about it just last year.

40:01.636 --> 40:04.761
And I've got the stuff on.

40:04.781 --> 40:06.404
I just thought maybe you'd followed it a little bit.

40:06.845 --> 40:10.070
And then briefly, and then I'll let you go, and thank you very much for your time.

40:11.332 --> 40:20.648
But you did mention also the other day that you had been brought into consulting the San Jose situation where you have the university library and the public library.

40:21.349 --> 40:23.132
There's going to be one for both.

40:23.973 --> 40:29.138
And if you could just tell me again what your attitude is on that development.

40:30.699 --> 40:37.726
Well, it clearly is a rising star from the political arena.

40:38.667 --> 40:53.220
The politicians view it as a win-win situation where the biggest bang for the buck to the cheap, and

40:53.774 --> 41:10.555
As a consequence, the principle may have merit in many situations, more situations than just San Jose certainly had.

41:10.575 --> 41:19.165
I would expect that this will become a model that we see elsewhere across the country in the future.

41:21.789 --> 41:22.870
I think that the

41:23.339 --> 41:35.312
philosophy of the public library and the philosophy of the academic library do come together in a rather clashing way in some respects.

41:35.613 --> 41:43.481
But given the political motivation, they will figure out how to make it work.

41:44.823 --> 41:48.807
It may not be as efficient as the politicians would have you believe.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.131
I think that the real savings are pretty

41:52.803 --> 42:19.249
And it may prove to be a bit of a, perceptively anyway, a bit of a problem for the scholar, but, you know, San Jose State is really a college and not a university, although it's called a university.

42:20.157 --> 42:22.700
And for a college, maybe this is just fine.

42:25.865 --> 42:32.033
I think that it has a pretty good collection for a college.

42:32.153 --> 42:37.981
There are, I'm sure, over a million volumes now.

42:40.865 --> 42:45.331
And the public library is a pretty dynamic public library.

42:45.351 --> 42:49.817
They have maybe 50 branches.

42:49.937 --> 42:50.097
Really?

42:50.735 --> 42:53.579
which are largely supported from this library.

42:53.619 --> 43:05.136
They will have, you know, when they buy something, they buy a dozen of them or 25 of them, but very few of them remain in the main library.

43:05.156 --> 43:09.663
The library for the public isn't that huge.

43:10.103 --> 43:11.545
So will they have one librarian?

43:12.627 --> 43:13.889
Will it be one administration?

43:14.369 --> 43:19.577
I don't think they've quite worked that out.

43:20.097 --> 43:32.108
I expect that there will be, actually I think there probably will be two librarians, the university librarian and the public librarian.

43:34.150 --> 43:49.564
I believe that there will be some form of a declaration, of operational declaration to establish who's responsible for what.

43:51.029 --> 44:05.845
I once heard both Jane and Jim speak of the advantage of making it a separate organizational entity so that they did not have to answer to the mayor.

44:07.106 --> 44:08.448
That's right.

44:09.369 --> 44:11.111
Or the college president.

44:11.371 --> 44:18.859
College president, which is an interesting concept that probably will not happen.

44:20.071 --> 44:22.153
But that would probably make life easier for us.

44:22.193 --> 44:24.295
Yeah, like the Turnpike Authority up here, you know.

44:24.976 --> 44:28.239
They basically run it apart from everything else.

44:28.799 --> 44:33.123
But I think Jane and Jim has stepped down.

44:33.163 --> 44:48.458
But at the time I was involved, I think they both had a positive approach to this, figuring that they were both going to get something out of it that was worth trying to achieve.

44:48.944 --> 44:50.105
So they're going ahead with it?

44:51.006 --> 44:52.148
So far as I know, they are.

44:52.188 --> 44:53.790
I know they selected an architect.

44:53.830 --> 44:56.153
Oh, they are going ahead with it.

44:56.173 --> 44:57.294
And it's going to be a big building.

44:57.334 --> 45:00.097
Of course, it helps that it's an urban university, an urban college.

45:00.398 --> 45:03.161
This wouldn't work if the college wasn't downtown, you know?

45:03.521 --> 45:05.003
That's correct.

45:05.023 --> 45:09.949
And if they had a campus out in the suburbs or something, then it's... Yeah, unless that college had a downtown.

45:10.289 --> 45:10.590
Right.

45:10.670 --> 45:17.618
Like in Broward County, I don't know if it was Florida, Atlantic, or... One of the...

45:18.627 --> 45:26.626
One of the Florida colleges or universities in that area has a downtown campus supported by the Broward County Library.

45:26.646 --> 45:27.328
See, I didn't know that.

45:27.649 --> 45:28.992
That's quite a huge library.

45:30.676 --> 45:32.440
Listen, you've been very generous with your time.

45:32.460 --> 45:35.387
I want to thank you very much.

45:36.076 --> 45:38.320
You did say you were going to send a copy.

45:38.520 --> 45:44.629
I sent you my book, and I sent it priority mail on Saturday, so I was hoping it would arrive by today.

45:44.830 --> 45:46.612
My wife is very pleased.

45:46.633 --> 45:47.314
She's a librarian.

45:48.656 --> 45:49.797
Is that right?

45:49.878 --> 45:52.201
She's been fondling that book in the bookstore.

45:52.482 --> 45:52.902
My book?

45:53.223 --> 45:53.563
Yeah.

45:53.583 --> 45:55.907
Oh, really?

45:55.887 --> 46:07.877
Well, it should arrive presently, and I'll certainly keep you up to date on this, and we'll certainly make sure you get a copy of this new book when it comes out.

46:07.897 --> 46:08.218
All right.

46:08.238 --> 46:12.902
And I'll call you back if there are any things that I feel I have to go over with you.

46:12.982 --> 46:15.164
I think you'd probably like to hear.

46:15.184 --> 46:17.025
By the way, happy birthday.

46:17.045 --> 46:17.926
I told you that, huh?

46:19.027 --> 46:20.048
Thank you very much.

46:20.609 --> 46:21.309
I appreciate it.

46:21.329 --> 46:22.210
Okay.

46:22.230 --> 46:23.271
Thanks so much for your time, sir.

46:23.771 --> 46:23.971
All right.

46:23.991 --> 46:24.172
Bye-bye.

46:24.532 --> 46:24.612
Bye.
