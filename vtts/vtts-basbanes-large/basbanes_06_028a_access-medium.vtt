07:07.255 --> 07:14.567
Bidders should note that the auctioneer may open bidding off the Leonardo da Vinci Codex hammer by placing a bid on behalf of the seller.

07:14.587 --> 07:23.442
I, as the auctioneer, may continue to bid on behalf of the seller up to the amount of the reserve, either by placing consecutive bids or by placing bids in response to other bidders.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.963
Another note I alluded to earlier.

Era nostra organizzazione, non solo io, a rappresentare la Fondazione Cari, che aveva intenzione di partecipare seriamente all'iniziativa,

11:42.065 --> 11:49.118
And, of course, in the field of its institutional goals, it was also hoped to win.

We have to take care of this reality, of this result, without abandoning too much

12:54.222 --> 13:07.168
commenti di dispiacere certamente che se fosse andata positivamente sarebbe stata di grande soddisfazione i concorrenti erano troppo forti 28 milioni di dollari beh tutto è relativo non sono i 28 milioni di dollari

14:40.655 --> 14:40.916
Good morning.

14:40.936 --> 14:41.196
Good morning.

14:41.699 --> 14:49.347
incredible price for this incredible, can't really say a word at the moment, it's a word at the moment.

14:49.367 --> 14:56.935
The manuscript supports two and a half types, more than any manuscript has taught in the past.

14:57.235 --> 15:01.419
Two and a half, I'll complete this record for the manuscript.

15:01.439 --> 15:11.149
It's pledged his pride as an enormous private collector, being against, as you saw in the book, the Calico Foundation,

15:11.315 --> 15:18.746
We're getting no audio.

15:18.766 --> 15:24.855
The press is getting no audio.

15:27.900 --> 15:28.120
Sorry.

15:28.280 --> 15:39.617
I thought it was a press conference, sorry.

15:40.137 --> 15:47.247
Thank you.

15:47.487 --> 16:06.313
Thank you.

16:06.597 --> 16:34.798
The extraordinary price of just over $30 million achieved for what was until today, the Hammer Codex, soon to be renamed, all for the incredible record price, two and a half times the record, the previous record for any manuscript,

16:35.200 --> 17:03.958
certainly the highest price for any work of art certainly anywhere in this year and indeed in the last four years at auction it was bought by an anonymous private collector bidding against the underbid of the Carriglo Foundation from the land supported by the Carriglo Bank who were the spirited underbidders in the room as I say it's bought by an anonymous private collector

17:04.141 --> 17:09.828
for this absolutely extraordinary and sensational price.

17:10.629 --> 17:15.054
We'd be happy to later on take care of your questions.

17:15.074 --> 17:31.954
I should introduce standing next to me to Steve Massey, the head of our book department, who was the auctioneer, and who had so much to do with the success of today's sale, having toured this great work of art around the world, to Europe, to Southeast Asia,

17:32.137 --> 17:59.595
um and two parts of this country before the sale uh in in a major logistic campaign um bringing bringing it to buyers in all parts of the world um and obviously uh that game campaign was successful um as we all saw in this triumphantly successful sale this morning and do you want to say a word or two um

17:59.963 --> 18:03.646
I'd just like to say that I'd be happy to answer any sort of technical questions.

18:03.727 --> 18:11.174
It's obviously a, it's an amazing morning for me, for our region office here at Christie's worldwide.

18:12.054 --> 18:28.570
Perhaps I would like to say that it's, it shouldn't be entirely a surprise, it's just an incredibly difficult thing to estimate based on its previous appearance, which was only, after all, 15 years or 14 years ago.

18:30.203 --> 18:31.946
Any questions?

18:31.986 --> 18:32.206
Yes.

18:32.587 --> 18:36.434
Could you tell me which gentleman actually did the bidding on the board?

18:36.674 --> 18:37.736
Yes, I can.

18:37.756 --> 18:39.118
This gentleman did the bidding.

18:39.139 --> 18:41.983
And what was his name and his child did it?

18:42.003 --> 18:44.768
Well, that's why I just made a first statement.

18:45.429 --> 18:46.391
I'm Alessandro Ganassi.

18:46.531 --> 18:50.478
I'm a member of the... Could you tell us for it, Alessandro Ganassi?

18:50.498 --> 18:52.201
I'm a member of the board, though.

18:52.361 --> 18:55.587
I'm a member of the board, though.

18:56.005 --> 19:09.864
who was a member of the board, and the Caracol Foundation participated in this auction with the support of the Caracol Foundation and the Chairman of the Bank of the City of Mexico.

19:09.984 --> 19:24.443
We thought, and I believe, that the amendment in chief belongs to our sort of cultural heritage, and particularly to Guadalajara, a part of which we could receive, and obviously we wanted to bring it back that way.

19:24.777 --> 19:30.265
Unfortunately for, I think, I don't find a piece of art.

19:30.285 --> 19:33.490
Actually, it's not all about the piece of art, it's much more.

19:33.710 --> 19:39.678
I think we tried the art and all of a sudden we're going to be disappointed.

19:39.699 --> 19:40.680
Thank you.

19:40.760 --> 19:44.325
Could you just tell us how to spell your name?

19:44.405 --> 19:45.387
I would like to say thank you.

19:45.487 --> 19:46.548
I would like to say thank you.

19:46.628 --> 19:49.473
I would like to say thank you.

19:49.653 --> 19:52.096
I would like to say thank you.

19:52.136 --> 19:52.557
Thank you.

19:52.688 --> 20:05.904
Yes, can you tell us if the collector is American, European, Asian?

20:06.084 --> 20:11.511
Can you tell us if it's a collector who was born?

20:11.751 --> 20:15.876
I can't tell you anything more than that.

20:15.996 --> 20:19.000
I can't tell anyone who's new to the market.

20:19.418 --> 20:29.357
Will it be viewable by the people, by the public?

20:29.999 --> 20:36.591
Which member of your stock has been for it?

20:36.631 --> 20:42.102
Do you want to install that for you?

20:42.723 --> 20:50.013
How many people did you take?

20:50.173 --> 21:07.697
I took bits from two, I took bits from two, I took bits from two, I took bits from two.

21:08.097 --> 21:08.578
That's it.

21:09.098 --> 21:09.739
Just two?

21:10.520 --> 21:33.992
I may be the only one who doesn't know, but perhaps you could quickly summarize the main differences between this one and the other two.

21:34.208 --> 21:44.059
This codex and the other two.

21:45.701 --> 21:53.730
Well, the second thing we were competing against was the Gospels of Henry the Lion, which is an illuminated manuscript.

21:54.170 --> 21:56.272
That was sold for $11.7 million.

21:56.392 --> 22:01.018
No, I mean there are two other codexes by Leonardo that the Italians own, apparently.

22:01.618 --> 22:03.220
No, I think there are many more.

22:03.622 --> 22:27.942
But there's a lot of manuscript material in Italy just as there is in Great Britain There could be none in America if the anonymous fire is not in America

22:29.980 --> 22:33.204
This manuscript was worth £2 million in 1980.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.687
It's worth $30 million now.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.670
Isn't this price quite mad?

22:38.651 --> 22:44.639
No, I would have thought it's not, because it actually fetched $5.6 million in 1980.

22:45.741 --> 22:55.313
And if you bought anything in 1980, nearly $6 million, I would have thought you might be getting up to $28 million now.

22:55.563 --> 23:23.460
as i said earlier the difficulty with this manuscript was that in 1980 it was much more characterized in the marketing as a work of art now we characterize it as a manuscript work of science and as such it's got um there's a great deal of difficulty attached to the valuations of the estimating of it and that was why i

23:24.098 --> 23:37.129
Well because the

23:38.442 --> 23:40.724
Because we last sold it in 1990.

23:40.825 --> 23:46.130
I didn't because I didn't.

23:46.771 --> 23:53.998
I mean, our firm did, but it was handled by the picture department as opposed to the manuscript department.

23:54.018 --> 23:55.380
Why the change?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.903
Why the change?

23:58.223 --> 23:58.964
Fair question.

23:58.984 --> 24:01.647
Why was it handled differently?

24:02.187 --> 24:06.812
Because this time around, it was given to the manuscript department.

24:07.973 --> 24:23.894
Any details on the other on the figures?

24:24.414 --> 24:29.201
No, you have the only figures.

24:29.701 --> 24:31.804
Let me look to read it.

24:36.138 --> 24:46.654
Thank you all very much indeed.
