00:05.549 --> 00:23.119
Please do not drain your glass dry until the end of these remarks.

00:23.099 --> 00:34.679
You're in for a brief State of the Union or State of the Association address, along with some elaborate pep talk without the profanity.

00:36.883 --> 00:40.770
It will take, give me 15 minutes and I'll set my key.

00:41.172 --> 00:50.911
Housekeeping before substance.

00:53.176 --> 00:56.262
We do have breakfasts, but they will be spartan.

00:56.242 --> 01:01.928
for reasons of budget and of the state of the association.

01:02.348 --> 01:10.677
Therefore, many of you, and perhaps most of you, should have real breakfast and then come to our breakfast.

01:10.817 --> 01:19.887
However, the dinner will not be a bacchanal, but thanks to an anonymous member's gift,

01:19.867 --> 01:26.296
For wine, we will have, we are not having a cash bar now, and we will not have a cash bar.

01:26.417 --> 01:42.781
I think you've discovered the three book exhibits in the foyer, I guess it's called, and please have a look at them.

01:42.801 --> 01:45.705
They are from members' books.

01:45.685 --> 01:50.633
and boarders and from the Association of University Presses.

01:51.196 --> 01:53.248
I'm grateful for them for having put them up.

01:53.617 --> 01:55.859
I have two requests to you.

01:55.919 --> 01:59.282
I've given an awful lot of orders, I've been told, but these are requests.

01:59.862 --> 02:02.545
That you participate and that you mix.

02:03.405 --> 02:07.089
We are having discussion sections, which are something of an experiment.

02:07.109 --> 02:08.710
There will be no major paper.

02:09.571 --> 02:18.318
You, as contributors, will have to produce the paper yourselves in your remarks on the topics which are announced for the discussion sections and the program.

02:18.338 --> 02:19.379
The program is still required.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.161
So please, think ahead.

02:21.381 --> 02:23.623
What are you going to say on these subjects?

02:23.603 --> 02:33.687
And then we have scheduled this reception, two breakfasts, a lunch, and a dinner in order to allow you to meet one another.

02:33.707 --> 02:34.268
Who are we?

02:36.213 --> 02:42.287
So there are plenty of people involved here and introduce yourselves to one another.

02:42.267 --> 02:48.157
Vanish shyness and sit with strangers.

02:49.179 --> 03:03.364
There will be no head table for those of us who for the moment are officers and speakers and the principal speakers, they will sit anywhere, we will all be at one together.

03:03.631 --> 03:10.903
So, and then please do not forget the members meeting which is tomorrow afternoon at 5.

03:10.923 --> 03:15.471
I think I may have to be reminded of it myself and then have to forget that.

03:16.372 --> 03:21.100
Now, our history as an association can be told in the encompass.

03:21.940 --> 03:28.347
a reform movement in literary studies came to life in California.

03:28.407 --> 03:33.933
That does not mean to do this.

03:34.413 --> 03:49.770
A small group of colleagues found the simple words that I now consider our constitution to foster a literary imagination and a common literary culture.

03:50.847 --> 03:56.587
Enough people signed that statement to permit an organizing meeting here in Boston in 1934.

03:56.728 --> 04:02.629
It led to our first conference in Minneapolis in September of 1994.

04:09.157 --> 04:20.409
and in terms of this conference.

04:20.709 --> 04:30.719
We are here because of our convictions about the nature and the proper study of literature or sortism.

04:30.740 --> 04:36.025
I shall not ask for a show of hands on your political convictions.

04:36.005 --> 04:51.502
But I'll mention that some of you believe it is possible and reasonable to be conservationists in cultural matters and liberal in political matters.

04:51.522 --> 05:00.612
In any case, we have generally agreed to eschew politics and to stick to literature.

05:00.592 --> 05:10.725
Now we have something like 1900 numbers, an annual entrance, a quality newspaper, and plans for a journal which will hear tomorrow.

05:11.747 --> 05:22.581
As Martin Luther King asked, following Chernyshevsky and Lenin and Tolstoy, where do we go from here?

05:22.601 --> 05:28.489
My experience as president tells me that the association has not yet spawned opposing factions.

05:28.469 --> 05:39.249
Rather, each of us, as an individual, is likely to feel an understandable ambulance about the group.

05:39.549 --> 05:43.296
We envision two very different kinds of activity.

05:43.336 --> 05:46.562
First, the association should pursue

05:46.542 --> 06:00.540
and encourage a study of literature centered on the value of literary values and provide a lively alternative to the many ideological studies and approaches that have occupied the field.

06:01.021 --> 06:13.477
We can sing our song so effectively and patiently that we shall win back to the folk that faithful will have strayed.

06:13.577 --> 06:15.520
Secondly,

06:15.500 --> 06:37.141
The society should actively oppose programs and departments that call themselves literary, but in which ideology and special interests take precedence over the literary imagination and the shared literary culture.

06:37.602 --> 06:40.765
We must fight back to regain lost ground.

06:41.048 --> 06:42.853
Now let's think a moment.

06:43.595 --> 06:45.820
Must we choose between the two?

06:47.124 --> 06:53.600
The second may be too aggressive for us cultural conservationists.

06:53.620 --> 06:58.112
Can't we accomplish the second by doing the first convincingly?

07:00.185 --> 07:12.091
Most of us in any case seem to believe that the first, pursuing literature on its own terms, must precede the second, opposing non-literary intrusions.

07:13.013 --> 07:15.358
The committee that planned this conference

07:16.098 --> 07:26.377
Jenny Clay, Jim Engle, Robin Miller, and Christopher Ricks, the chairman, chose to stay away from polemical topics.

07:27.018 --> 07:33.870
During these three days in Boston, we are discussing what we believe in, not what we default.

07:35.116 --> 07:47.205
But now that we are completing our second year of good behavior, it is not time for us to allow a judicial activism.

07:48.087 --> 07:52.838
Can't we become more dedicated to our cause without becoming shrill?

07:54.337 --> 07:57.160
As president, I have been sorely tried.

07:58.642 --> 08:04.128
Job announcements in English and language call increasingly for non-literary qualifications.

08:04.649 --> 08:19.365
Publishers' humanities catalogs read with the categories gender, culture, slash power, mental studies, and theory before literature and the classics are even mentioned.

08:20.273 --> 08:33.639
And no one really knows what is being read in the required freshman English and composition courses for which we are all basically responsible.

08:33.659 --> 08:40.813
Every case of literature spurned pushes me further toward favoring group action.

08:41.738 --> 08:47.686
Meanwhile, we must not neglect the responsibilities of individuals.

08:48.467 --> 08:51.330
We can still speak and vote in meetings.

08:51.350 --> 08:54.434
Reason and common sense are not entirely dead.

08:55.155 --> 09:06.990
Given the choice, students still respond to literature taught not as little ideology, but as a subtle art vitally concerned with life.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.113
But how long will they have the choice?

09:10.797 --> 09:20.331
Those of us with tenure must stand firm in decisions about persons, curriculum, programs, requirements, hirings, and promotions.

09:20.351 --> 09:28.342
And, as always, a clear opportunity for counteroffensive belongs to individuals.

09:28.362 --> 09:30.105
I have three examples.

09:31.570 --> 09:43.234
The pseudo-history, called Afrocentrism, has been exposed and torn to shreds by a single book.

09:43.855 --> 09:58.636
Now I'll ask her by Mary Lefkowitz, who was one of our earliest members.

09:58.656 --> 09:58.976
Is she here?

09:58.996 --> 09:59.918
Is Mary Lefkowitz here?

09:59.938 --> 10:00.338
Please stand up.

10:00.358 --> 10:05.205
Thank you.

10:05.506 --> 10:23.208
The pseudo-theory of the social construction of scientific laws along with its bombastic prose style has been wickedly paroled in social text by a non-visual who is not here.

10:23.228 --> 10:34.382
And the historian, he is not here either, Russell Jacoby, whom you may not know, has raised his voice in our support.

10:36.927 --> 10:51.173
The closing pages, the closing chapters of dogmatic wisdom.

10:51.845 --> 11:06.759
confront the obscurantist post-style of some of our most extreme colleagues who claim that, quote, clarity is repressive.

11:06.939 --> 11:18.510
And Jacobi's lingua franca article, Marginal Returns, September of 95, gives post-colonial theory that public gloving deserves.

11:18.980 --> 11:32.753
These three examples suggest that individual attacks can pinpoint specific abuses and seriously weaken them, and that there are more projects of this kind afoot, as many of you know.

11:33.954 --> 11:47.907
I advocate, therefore, a measured increase in activism from both the Association and from the individuals who support it in order to restore literature to literary studies.

11:48.629 --> 11:56.319
However, I believe there is a deeper level of unease among us than the purely literary.

11:56.339 --> 12:13.180
In our democratic society, the only basic functions of justice, of politics, of the marketplace, and of sports all operate on the basis of an adversarial system.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.003
Someone wins and someone loses.

12:17.367 --> 12:28.920
In these part of times, the teaching and the learning and the reading of literature are being drawn increasingly into that adversarial system.

12:28.940 --> 12:37.909
Daniel Trilling spotted the development way ahead of time in the 1960s when he referred to the adversary culture.

12:37.929 --> 12:44.877
Now we have a starker and a darker phrase, the cultural wars.

12:45.481 --> 12:50.031
In the classroom too, must we now succumb to the adversarial culture?

12:51.234 --> 12:52.958
I strongly oppose that.

12:53.659 --> 13:01.296
A sounder dynamic resides in dialogue, a friendly dialogue between tradition and discovery.

13:03.588 --> 13:13.006
We are not your enemies, proclaimed the modern French poet Apollinaire, my first great love.

13:13.988 --> 13:23.706
He was talking about

13:23.990 --> 13:44.884
I put in a friendly quarrel between order and adventure, leads not to the victory of one side or the other, but to the reconciliation embodied in La Jolie-Housse, the redhead, the pretty redhead, when we went on to town.

13:50.905 --> 14:06.186
I put in his own poetry, sometimes haunting the tradition, and sometimes brashly experimentally, sings against the belligerently adversarial system in literature and education.

14:07.268 --> 14:10.973
Out of these remarks, I have a few proposals to make.

14:10.953 --> 14:26.886
I suggest that next year's conference promote one major session to an examination and critique of the textbooks now available for use in composition and freshman English courses.

14:26.986 --> 14:31.030
What literature do they contain, if any?

14:31.050 --> 14:32.851
Which have had the widest adoptions?

14:32.871 --> 14:33.672
What do they teach?

14:33.692 --> 14:35.614
What kinds of professors produce them?

14:36.114 --> 14:39.337
What kinds of results can we expect from their word spread use?

14:39.457 --> 14:40.858
How could we do that?

14:41.581 --> 14:51.876
Compared to curricula and course descriptions, these textbooks provide an available and very concrete type topic for us to examine as scholars and critics.

14:52.397 --> 14:56.042
Hundreds of thousands of students take these courses.

14:56.683 --> 15:03.554
We must not abandon these students to essentially non-literary programs and approaches.

15:03.654 --> 15:08.601
I suggest also that one or two members be delegated to explore with book editors,

15:09.408 --> 15:15.940
the categories and series in which publishing houses tend to acquire and present their titles.

15:16.881 --> 15:24.014
How extensive are the self-fulfilling effects of always leading with culture, power, gender, and theory?

15:25.096 --> 15:30.285
Why do so many editors now dismiss the category of the single author book?

15:31.987 --> 15:45.405
As for my third proposal, I issue an unabashed call, not for papers, but for satires and parodies, only on the excesses of our profession.

15:45.425 --> 15:55.378
Somewhere among us, there must lie sleeping a Pervantes, or a Swift, or a Hope, or a Voltaire.

15:55.358 --> 16:02.370
Is there any truth in the room that Ron Charles came from this organization?

16:02.390 --> 16:07.038
It's a good one of the organizations.

16:07.058 --> 16:17.856
It is, for those of you who don't know about it,

16:17.836 --> 16:29.760
is a powerful parody of a letter of application for a trial of a person who reports to a person who's in a nation of pilot literature and, of course, the one step out of the boat.

16:29.800 --> 16:34.950
When he comes to the end, then Mary Wollstonecraft is presenting as the author of The Pirates of Red Band.

16:34.930 --> 16:42.420
Thank you for the illustration.

16:42.881 --> 17:03.790
The time has come, for me, is by a 20th thesis to the 19th thesis on literature that I stirred together for the original group

17:03.770 --> 17:06.375
who wants this organization two years ago.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.719
Thesis 20.

17:11.364 --> 17:23.626
The test of the highest poetry is that it eludes all tests.

17:23.646 --> 17:27.533
In these words, Swinburne leaped far beyond

17:28.103 --> 17:31.288
a snappy quip and the Irish wolf.

17:31.308 --> 17:41.864
He told the essential and exasperating truth about literature and thusly bear the terrifying challenge of ever teaching.

17:41.884 --> 17:49.034
We have a toast now.

17:49.054 --> 17:50.056
Long live.

17:50.076 --> 17:56.305
Long live the literary imagination and a common literary culture.

18:05.285 --> 18:12.322
[Applause.]

18:13.000 --> 21:27.000
[Crowd murmuring.]
