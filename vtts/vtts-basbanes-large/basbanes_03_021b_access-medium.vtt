WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:06.379
I have the man who has given guilt back its good name.

00:06.399 --> 00:07.220
Oh, that's funny.

00:08.682 --> 00:09.803
From your drinking buddy.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.445
Bruce, wow.

00:13.668 --> 00:20.537
What do you think of that?

00:20.917 --> 00:23.481
Smile bad as Dr. Coles over here.

00:24.081 --> 00:24.822
Who would have thought?

00:25.383 --> 00:28.667
He says, P.S., call me, oh mystery man.

00:28.808 --> 00:30.249
Call me, oh mystery man.

00:30.269 --> 00:30.730
Wow.

00:30.946 --> 00:32.007
So you hit it off with him.

00:32.027 --> 00:35.711
At this point, my son's decided that I actually had done something in life.

00:36.111 --> 00:36.712
Yeah.

00:36.732 --> 00:37.072
It isn't.

00:37.112 --> 00:37.793
That's something.

00:38.193 --> 00:39.755
And there's the stuff here.

00:40.315 --> 00:41.416
Well, you'll see.

00:41.937 --> 00:49.204
You know, this is all his writing, including something in the O'Connor, where he'd been reading O'Connor.

00:52.147 --> 00:53.589
Who's the publisher of this, might I ask?

00:53.789 --> 00:54.850
Yeah.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.011
You should get that.

00:56.031 --> 00:58.033
Yeah, I'll get it.

00:58.053 --> 00:58.894
Here it is.

00:59.313 --> 01:00.735
Avon books.

01:00.835 --> 01:01.737
Avon?

01:01.757 --> 01:02.698
Okay, Avon.

01:02.758 --> 01:17.600
You're going to book this up.

01:25.973 --> 01:28.797
It's a wonderful book.

01:29.350 --> 01:29.871
.

01:29.891 --> 01:30.072
.

01:30.713 --> 01:47.950
.

01:51.153 --> 02:08.796
Now, we can't even know what, but we can't even know what we're talking about.

02:08.816 --> 02:18.308
We're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about how we're talking about.

02:19.469 --> 02:39.929
Okay.

02:41.510 --> 02:45.955
Right over here.

02:46.135 --> 02:47.276
Right here.

02:47.296 --> 02:48.497
It's right here on the right.

02:49.675 --> 02:51.116
That's Barnhoff.

02:51.817 --> 02:52.037
Yeah.

02:52.097 --> 02:54.560
Between Percy and Williams.

02:54.580 --> 02:54.720
Uh-huh.

02:54.740 --> 02:55.941
This is no accident.

02:57.342 --> 02:59.144
When did that piece run on the New Yorker?

02:59.184 --> 03:01.106
No, it was a two-part profile.

03:01.126 --> 03:04.028
It came in... Remember last hand what year it was?

03:06.791 --> 03:12.396
I can... It'll save me a little time when I go to the library to read it, that's all.

03:12.416 --> 03:15.820
There was all this stuff... Doctor, don't bother.

03:15.860 --> 03:16.340
I'll find it.

03:16.941 --> 03:17.421
It was...

03:18.160 --> 03:19.882
Yeah, at some place.

03:19.902 --> 03:26.232
It would have been around, uh, uh, the 70s probably.

03:26.252 --> 03:26.652
Okay.

03:28.675 --> 03:29.336
Well, fine.

03:29.436 --> 03:31.579
It's just, usually, they list it by years as well.

03:31.599 --> 03:34.443
Yeah, it was two, uh... So it was two, it was two-part.

03:34.624 --> 03:34.864
Yeah.

03:35.625 --> 03:36.486
Yeah.

03:36.506 --> 03:36.606
Okay.

03:36.626 --> 03:40.792
And this is Walker and Babb, by the other ways, and that's Bonhoeff and Ralph Williams.

03:41.273 --> 03:41.574
Wow.

03:41.654 --> 03:42.615
Flannery O'Connor.

03:43.152 --> 03:47.636
My mother gave me a picture of that, but it's not usually seen.

03:47.657 --> 03:51.400
You know, she said a little prayer there.

03:52.121 --> 03:52.321
Wonderful.

03:53.863 --> 03:56.105
There's Walker and May.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.667
Agee over there, I think, right?

03:57.927 --> 03:59.088
That's right, Agee.

04:00.169 --> 04:02.892
This is another one of hers here.

04:02.912 --> 04:03.633
That's a nice one.

04:03.653 --> 04:05.635
It's down in Covington, I bet, right?

04:05.655 --> 04:07.016
Yeah.

04:07.036 --> 04:08.097
And Carver.

04:08.262 --> 04:08.742
Carver.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.384
Yeah, we haven't even mentioned Carver.

04:10.984 --> 04:11.625
Very important.

04:11.645 --> 04:14.507
I taught him and taught him in the course.

04:15.088 --> 04:22.374
And he's kind of a recent addition to, I mean, he's been dead for a while, but kind of a recent addition to your canon.

04:22.454 --> 04:23.575
I hate to use that word.

04:23.595 --> 04:24.896
Well, he's very much part of it.

04:24.916 --> 04:33.323
I got to know Tess Gower, and I talked with her much after he died, but very much part of that whole course.

04:33.343 --> 04:34.264
Yeah, fabulous.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.346
I think I should leave the young man alone here.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.527
That's Erickson.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.314
That's boring.

04:40.334 --> 04:41.355
That's Anna Floyd.

04:41.636 --> 04:43.519
Wow.

04:43.539 --> 04:46.964
So this is selecting pictures for the study.

04:46.984 --> 04:47.946
It's very important.

04:47.966 --> 04:53.535
Again, we were talking about the importance of the... Here's an interesting story.

04:53.555 --> 04:54.937
You see this photograph?

04:54.957 --> 04:55.178
Yeah.

04:57.962 --> 05:01.047
That photograph was brought to mine to a walk.

05:02.930 --> 05:03.531
And he said, let me grab that.

05:03.832 --> 05:12.081
And only she could find in New York City a store with the word psychiatrist.

05:12.342 --> 05:14.804
Only Helen Levin.

05:15.886 --> 05:18.128
I said, how did she find that?

05:18.388 --> 05:21.392
She said, I just like to walk and look.

05:21.432 --> 05:22.633
I like to walk and look.

05:23.454 --> 05:25.636
This is a new digital camera, by the way.

05:25.797 --> 05:27.679
I can take like 300 pictures.

05:27.719 --> 05:29.721
This is a new digital camera that I have.

05:30.224 --> 05:32.827
And it's just amazing all the different pictures like that.

05:32.848 --> 05:34.450
I don't know how to use cameras at all.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.814
I need to take a picture.

05:37.834 --> 05:38.275
Whatever.

05:38.295 --> 05:42.140
This is my son Daniel and my grandson.

05:44.143 --> 05:47.447
These are some fancy pictures from my mother.

05:48.589 --> 05:54.957
I'm sure you don't want to get any balanced reflection there.

05:55.057 --> 05:57.160
You can even see the pictures that I'm getting here.

05:57.882 --> 06:03.530
I remember the old-fashioned brown cameras in my palace.

06:05.132 --> 06:09.297
I swore that I would never go digital, but I broke down.

06:09.357 --> 06:11.640
I still carry a film camera with me, just in case.

06:14.264 --> 06:21.173
I'll be able to go home and download these pictures.

06:22.469 --> 06:33.272
Well, Doctor, I think, briefly, if we could just do a brief quote on Carver, and also, we never did... I think so, yeah.

06:33.553 --> 06:41.811
I have a very important...

06:42.365 --> 06:47.990
Raymond Conover's story of working people in their ordinary lives.

06:48.691 --> 07:01.302
He was a master storyteller, and the story of his life is the story of vulnerability and marginality of sorts, social and economic.

07:01.962 --> 07:10.870
But what came out of that, and someone who knew how to tell those stories in ways that one

07:11.963 --> 07:13.625
remembers and remembers.

07:14.406 --> 07:16.929
And then, of course, he dies fairly young.

07:16.969 --> 07:21.574
He died young the way Agee did, the way Orwell did.

07:22.675 --> 07:27.441
And there's an acceptance of it that is almost inspirational, isn't it?

07:27.461 --> 07:33.467
I think he knew he was, well, he knew he was dying because he had cancer in the lung, I think, that had metastasized.

07:34.068 --> 07:37.532
But, you know, these are brief, luminous

07:40.060 --> 07:45.128
almost incandescent lives that these men lived.

07:46.110 --> 07:58.910
And, in contrast, is the older, longer, luminous, incandescent life of someone like, such as Tilley Olsen.

08:02.295 --> 08:04.819
Zora Neale Hurston also died young.

08:06.470 --> 08:08.392
Better not get into this.

08:08.412 --> 08:15.301
Of course, John Keats, who did some medical, they like to say he had some medical training, but, you know, some.

08:15.321 --> 08:16.363
Yeah.

08:17.043 --> 08:18.185
You look at Keats.

08:18.365 --> 08:22.010
Chekhov, of course, is another of your position type.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.532
Yeah, yes, and I'll use him.

08:23.732 --> 08:26.696
In fact, I've written an introduction to some of his stories.

08:27.016 --> 08:32.043
Well, Chekhov-Williams-Stories.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.308
And Chekhov, that

08:36.507 --> 08:58.549
Chekhov in Sakhalin Island, talk about the tradition of documentary work, crossing the whole continent at that time, the whole world, to get to Sakhalin, working there and observing and telling the world about what he saw, so important.

08:58.569 --> 09:06.497
Talk about, I mean, there's Patterson, William Carlos Williams is Patterson, and also his doctor's stories in

09:06.781 --> 09:07.322
prose.

09:07.742 --> 09:12.208
And then there's Chekhov, Sakhalin, the island term.

09:13.669 --> 09:14.290
Fantastic.

09:14.310 --> 09:19.737
Just briefly, the importance of Kierkegaard in the life of Walker Percy.

09:20.658 --> 09:36.197
Because Kierkegaard, in some way, as Walker used to tell me, Kierkegaard, before Floyd, understood the unconscious and how it works, understood negatives becoming

09:37.392 --> 09:49.625
almost with incendiary fire in the person's life, and fear and trembling is the book that Kierkegaard wrote, and also the concept of dread or anxiety.

09:50.346 --> 09:52.448
So he was a master psychologist.

09:53.329 --> 09:58.774
Walker kept telling me, he used to joke with me, he said, your buddy Freud.

09:58.794 --> 10:00.516
I said, Walker, my buddy Freud?

10:01.557 --> 10:05.121
Your buddy Freud would have a lot to learn from Kierkegaard.

10:05.607 --> 10:10.994
And where, at what point in his life do you think Walker encountered Kierkegaard?

10:11.094 --> 10:11.795
When he was sick?

10:12.276 --> 10:23.470
I think when he was sick, you remember, he majored in chemistry in college, then he went to medical school, then he was an intern there at Bellevue, and then he was sick.

10:23.491 --> 10:25.513
He went up to Saranac Lake, I think.

10:25.533 --> 10:30.720
Yeah, and then he was sick, but then he read, and he read, and he read, and you know,

10:31.342 --> 10:46.106
ailing, he embraced, this is when he went through his spiritual, I won't call it a crisis, his spiritual life.

10:51.756 --> 10:54.480
That's when he became spiritually awake

10:54.747 --> 11:02.597
and alive and connected to the reflections both in the Bible and in the whole tradition.

11:02.937 --> 11:04.339
I know he told me he read St.

11:04.439 --> 11:14.412
Augustine, he read Pascal, of course, and anyone who read Kierkegaard would understand that Pascal and Kierkegaard were soul buddies, if you'll pardon the expression.

11:14.472 --> 11:16.835
I'm glad I asked the question.

11:16.855 --> 11:17.896
That's a wonderful answer.

11:17.916 --> 11:19.138
Thank you.

11:19.158 --> 11:19.438
Thank you.

11:20.195 --> 11:20.817
Anyway.

11:21.399 --> 11:24.288
Listen, I've taken up a lot of these.

11:24.308 --> 11:24.710
No, no, no.

11:24.730 --> 11:26.616
This is going to be all going here.

11:26.636 --> 11:27.739
I will up.

11:27.759 --> 11:28.281
But I will do it.
