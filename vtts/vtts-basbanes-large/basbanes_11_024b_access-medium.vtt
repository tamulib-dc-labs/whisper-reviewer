WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:07.997
The Atlas, which again?

00:08.017 --> 00:12.842
Atlas and Mayo, which is the most famous Atlas.

00:14.905 --> 00:18.369
Atlas, that's Atlas, and then Mayo, just the large one, the large Atlas.

00:19.030 --> 00:20.151
What is it, 12 parts?

00:20.171 --> 00:23.415
12 parts, yes.

00:24.136 --> 00:28.761
It's one of the... I don't know, it's in the millions of pieces.

00:28.861 --> 00:30.043
It's the most famous Atlas, yes.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.084
Yes, oh yes.

00:31.452 --> 00:35.460
It's in rather thin volumes, actually.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.726
But there's only a quarter here, or the whole?

00:38.866 --> 00:47.082
It's a whole in the collection of Per Brahe and a quarter in the collection of... You have more than one quarter.

00:47.803 --> 00:51.169
Yes, that's a very rare book to sell.

00:52.131 --> 00:53.173
Or acquire a boat.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.038
Oh, we weren't in this.

01:04.098 --> 01:04.619
Were we in this?

01:04.679 --> 01:05.060
We are.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.222
Yes, this is the Rangel.

01:06.242 --> 01:06.542
That's right.

01:06.562 --> 01:07.423
We were over there.

01:07.503 --> 01:09.807
Rangel and Pedro are together today.

01:11.349 --> 01:12.571
They are from the same town.

01:15.155 --> 01:15.936
Oh, my goodness.

01:17.679 --> 01:28.375
And some copies of this are stored in... I think there is one in the Uppsala University Library where that's called.

01:29.519 --> 01:32.546
And that's how you'll find references to it?

01:32.566 --> 01:33.969
Atlas Mayo and Blau, yes.

01:34.270 --> 01:34.992
It is Blau, isn't it?

01:35.012 --> 01:35.834
They are Blau, yes.

01:38.219 --> 01:41.607
They had a Blau at the Bernadette yesterday.

01:41.868 --> 01:42.550
They did?

01:42.710 --> 01:44.454
There's one volume.

01:44.494 --> 01:46.178
This was issued in many volumes, right?

01:46.934 --> 01:51.119
So Atlas Mayer, apparently, it's not the actual book, it's not the book, it's known.

01:51.499 --> 01:53.001
It's called G.E.L.A.

01:53.021 --> 01:53.422
or something.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.064
Yes, and the different parts, yeah.

01:55.144 --> 01:56.946
But it's always referred to as the Atlas Mayer.

01:57.146 --> 01:58.187
G.E.O.

01:58.968 --> 02:00.350
This is really intense, yes.

02:02.612 --> 02:05.135
The E.L.A.

02:05.496 --> 02:08.179
The V is actually the G.E.L.A.

02:08.199 --> 02:14.286
Maybe I should just take a picture, that'll be a little easier.

02:14.306 --> 02:14.967
The camera's camera.

02:16.010 --> 02:28.481
1662 How many volumes of this do you have?

02:28.501 --> 02:43.435
We have got 12 in one library and 3 in another So you have all 15, what, there are 15?

02:43.475 --> 02:46.017
No, there are 12, but there is a quarter from

02:46.452 --> 02:49.055
One copy was divided among the daughters.

02:49.215 --> 02:50.616
So you have a complete set here?

02:50.817 --> 02:51.097
Yes.

02:51.117 --> 02:54.040
Plus a quarter of the one set, yes.

02:54.060 --> 02:56.002
Now, at the Bernadette, they have one volume.

02:56.282 --> 03:00.807
That's the book I was telling you about, which they have, and it's out there for decoration in the red.

03:01.708 --> 03:04.211
And it came in, and I said, gee, how did they get it?

03:04.291 --> 03:05.332
Oh, somebody gave it to them.

03:06.112 --> 03:06.773
And I said, who?

03:07.214 --> 03:07.774
They don't know.

03:07.994 --> 03:09.836
Oh, it was a merit gift.

03:09.856 --> 03:10.217
That's right.

03:10.237 --> 03:11.398
It came in in 1972.

03:12.159 --> 03:16.223
But somebody gave them the one volume, and they didn't keep a record of who gave it to them.

03:16.642 --> 03:17.864
I said, you get a book like this?

03:17.924 --> 03:19.707
And the guy didn't even get a thank you, though.

03:21.069 --> 03:23.252
They don't even know who gave it to them.

03:23.312 --> 03:24.694
To say thank you.

03:24.714 --> 03:26.517
Maybe they did, but you think that they don't.

03:27.779 --> 03:34.950
I think the reason why it's called the Atlas Meijer is that there was also another edition, probably in another side of the book called the Atlas Meijer.

03:35.050 --> 03:36.151
The condition of this, though.

03:36.171 --> 03:37.393
Look at the condition of this.

03:37.794 --> 03:39.176
You think this was purchased new?

03:40.017 --> 03:42.160
You think this is a one-owner copy?

03:43.082 --> 03:44.043
Yes, yes.

03:44.063 --> 03:45.265
Per Brahe bought it.

03:46.105 --> 03:47.807
kept it in his castle.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.128
And it's still there.

03:49.148 --> 03:49.468
Yes.

03:49.488 --> 03:50.769
Well, that's pretty interesting.

03:50.789 --> 03:56.435
Let me just wait, get it for sure.

03:56.455 --> 04:01.680
This is a book you frequently see dissected and framed.

04:01.920 --> 04:08.186
Well, imperfect copies would be saved by that.

04:09.247 --> 04:10.028
Amazing.

04:10.048 --> 04:15.893
I'm just going to see that book.

04:16.514 --> 04:22.243
You would describe this in your professional judgment?

04:22.444 --> 04:25.889
Well, this is a perfect position.

04:25.909 --> 04:29.756
I suppose it is.

04:29.916 --> 04:33.622
Nothing's ever happened to it.

04:33.642 --> 04:38.691
There's no browning, there's no spotting, there's no... And the colouring is contemporary and perfect.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.834
And it's the one that's been in the possession.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.323
It's been here since February and brought it.

04:44.543 --> 04:46.405
Yes, 1682, 1883.

04:46.585 --> 04:52.571
Would you say that's possibly the most valuable book in the collection?

04:53.812 --> 04:56.675
One of the most valuable.

04:56.715 --> 04:57.876
What others would you put in?

04:57.916 --> 05:03.462
We have got Bridget's Relevations in Conovla.

05:04.503 --> 05:07.466
Yes, and I think that one.

05:07.506 --> 05:08.907
That's the top item probably.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.028
Yes, yes.

05:11.307 --> 05:14.371
We discussed it in the car, one of those five copies surviving.

05:16.293 --> 05:22.642
Make sure you see that.

05:23.102 --> 05:29.310
That's interesting, of course.

05:29.470 --> 05:36.319
That's a publisher's writing?

05:37.582 --> 05:39.124
It says that?

05:39.865 --> 05:40.506
Does it say that?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.209
No, no, we know that.

05:42.229 --> 05:42.770
We know that.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.733
Because he bought it.

05:44.773 --> 05:47.217
Please send me a post.

05:47.357 --> 05:58.033
Oh, wow.

05:58.494 --> 06:04.263
This is quite a striking room too, isn't it?

06:04.283 --> 06:04.403
It is.

06:04.543 --> 06:05.665
It is not.

06:06.488 --> 06:13.959
All these rooms have names?

06:16.102 --> 06:17.484
All these rooms have names?

06:17.504 --> 06:18.205
Yes.

06:18.225 --> 06:19.827
Oh, you have to tell me the names.

06:20.087 --> 06:29.461
So this one is called... Why don't you just write them down?

06:29.481 --> 06:33.186
Go in this direction, down this way.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.090
Start with Stockholm.

06:38.669 --> 06:54.245
KÃ¶ln, Colonial, Rome, Nantes, Bremen, Germany, and the last, Neapel, Napoli.

06:54.265 --> 06:54.605
Naples.

06:54.666 --> 06:56.547
Naples, I write it in.

06:57.188 --> 06:58.309
You call it Napoli?

06:58.490 --> 06:59.551
No, we call it Neapel.

06:59.871 --> 07:01.413
Neapel, that's the German word.

07:01.433 --> 07:06.718
Okay, just do it the way you do it, and then I'll, you know, I want it in your, I don't want my choice.

07:07.694 --> 07:12.079
And we have, at last, Venice, Venedig.

07:14.082 --> 07:20.329
That's where the Incarnabula are kept.

07:20.809 --> 07:24.274
Where was the atlas kept?

07:24.294 --> 07:25.915
Which room?

07:29.720 --> 07:29.820
Okay.

07:30.222 --> 07:33.265
The most small picture of the castle from 1820.

07:33.305 --> 07:42.836
There are lots of elements up here and we have a book which was used when they made the decorations.

07:43.116 --> 07:44.638
And it was totally broken.

07:45.338 --> 07:47.701
So we can imagine that it was lying here.

07:48.142 --> 07:50.844
Oh yes, but no paint in it.

07:51.826 --> 07:55.029
No, no, no.

07:55.049 --> 07:56.871
They live from...

07:57.526 --> 08:15.936
Painted on the ceiling.

08:17.318 --> 08:19.822
And in the Nantes room, animals.

08:19.962 --> 08:24.630
And these were taken from a book.

08:25.032 --> 08:31.480
Which you have, which is basically just used to wax.

08:31.500 --> 08:31.820
Yes.

08:32.161 --> 08:34.924
All the lilies.

08:34.944 --> 08:36.166
What kind of animals?

08:36.386 --> 08:40.251
How would you identify them?

08:40.951 --> 08:42.353
But it's a wild animal.

08:42.453 --> 08:49.622
Yes, wild animal.

08:50.412 --> 08:55.940
Very special, the cat animal, which is very... Well, that's the name is Lynx.

08:55.961 --> 08:57.383
Oh, Lynx, I know Lynx.

08:57.603 --> 09:02.330
We have a... It's the only cat animal in Sweden, which is why.

09:03.272 --> 09:05.074
Only feline in Sweden, right?

09:12.346 --> 09:13.007
What do you think?

09:14.829 --> 09:15.370
I don't know.

09:15.851 --> 09:18.495
Maybe they were never ready.

09:18.914 --> 09:25.724
Is it possible they were planned to be set in the wood?

09:26.686 --> 09:29.470
Well, see, the map has a frame.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.213
Of course, you'd have to mount that.

09:32.274 --> 09:40.086
I mean, and the paintings in the rest of the castle do have frames, but the paintings in the library don't.

09:41.107 --> 09:41.668
Interesting.

09:41.688 --> 09:46.195
Are these pictures considered inferior to the ones below?

09:46.355 --> 09:48.178
No, not at all.

09:50.251 --> 09:54.496
Socrates, Solon, Pythagoras, who else?

09:54.796 --> 10:00.283
Oh, Lucidides.

10:06.290 --> 10:15.141
Pictures and, not books, that's not actually a book, but to lend pictures, Eishimaldi for example, to other museums around the world.

10:16.262 --> 10:18.925
And people come here to see them and

10:19.073 --> 10:27.542
And they're not here.

10:28.282 --> 10:30.905
And this room is?

10:34.168 --> 10:40.415
Naples, where the manuscripts were kept.

10:40.675 --> 10:45.520
And what kind of manuscripts did you have?

10:46.462 --> 11:15.608
letters we also called letters the manuscript correspondence yes correspondence but also books books not many and that's a very small collection the main part was correspondence it's a beautiful room yes it is and this was the room where there were lots of chairs and sofas so they could sit here and then read and listen to music too oh really yes yes that was at the time of charles

11:15.875 --> 11:19.843
Carl-Johan Bernadotte, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte.

11:19.863 --> 11:21.747
That was at the beginning of the 19th century.

11:22.388 --> 11:24.552
And the king came here frequently.

11:24.572 --> 11:26.917
That's the one we talked about, the martial art, the Napoleons.

11:28.259 --> 11:28.460
Yep.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.107
Our French king.

11:32.127 --> 11:34.151
This is a cabinet of curiosity.

11:34.311 --> 11:34.532
Yes.

11:34.572 --> 11:37.157
This is the precursor to the modern museum.

11:38.926 --> 11:40.488
Oh, look at the bricks.

11:40.589 --> 11:48.401
Look, let me hand you.

11:49.222 --> 11:52.427
Oh, these two.

11:52.487 --> 11:54.971
Wow.

11:59.678 --> 12:07.650
This is amazing.

12:14.009 --> 12:24.187
Different people draw wood from all the world, with a name written on them in Latin.

12:24.207 --> 12:26.712
Yes, yes, yes.

12:26.912 --> 12:31.721
But this is later, this is not from the time again, from the 19th century.

12:31.741 --> 12:38.633
It's quite late, but even the corns kept here.

12:40.857 --> 12:43.400
The birds you said were given to him by whom?

12:43.420 --> 12:44.561
Two in the bag.

12:45.983 --> 12:46.784
What was it?

12:46.944 --> 12:50.208
It's spelled by two in the bag.

12:50.348 --> 12:54.633
T-H-U-M-B-E-R-G.

12:54.653 --> 13:01.741
It was the first one to issue a flora of Japan, but he's a proto-flora of Japan and the Cape Colony.

13:01.761 --> 13:03.804
So his Japanese love him.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.747
So his books are very sought out.

13:10.270 --> 13:14.721
Yes, exotic books.

13:15.302 --> 13:16.205
Yes.

13:16.225 --> 13:25.427
Antiquity.

13:26.335 --> 13:38.949
This is a collection from the Swedish Manor, quite far away from here.

13:39.689 --> 13:47.017
But the owner was called Ulrik Sjeffer and he married a widow in the cluster and took his books with him here.

13:47.378 --> 13:48.559
Nothing else from his home.

13:48.819 --> 13:50.681
And the name of this room?

13:51.342 --> 13:53.284
This room is Bremen.

13:54.045 --> 13:55.026
Bremen, yes.

13:55.225 --> 13:59.911
And that's a French collection.

14:02.855 --> 14:03.356
French.

14:04.217 --> 14:18.776
Both from the 18th century.

14:21.059 --> 14:23.342
So there are some

14:23.727 --> 14:25.169
volumes of plates as well.

14:25.189 --> 14:31.876
Yes, they're only, I think they're only two plates.

14:31.896 --> 14:33.357
But it's the first edition?

14:34.178 --> 14:41.266
Yes, yes it is.

14:41.806 --> 14:52.738
Who is working here?

14:52.972 --> 15:17.798
uh paper restorers paper restorers so you're doing some work with some of the books yes and uh she checks the books to see if they are in a good condition

15:18.672 --> 15:24.822
bad climate, because the circulation in the room is not as good as it is supposed to be.

15:25.042 --> 15:38.063
Yes, yes, because there used to be a fireplace, but they have taken it away, they have closed it 100 years ago, and that has changed the circulation in this room, and that makes the problem.

15:38.083 --> 15:38.885
It's bad for the books?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.728
Yes, yes.

15:40.768 --> 15:45.996
So we have been talking, if there will be more problems in here, we will take the books to the other room, too.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.142
But the chill is no problem.

15:48.563 --> 15:51.768
No, cold is in front of the books.

15:55.193 --> 15:59.500
So actually the climate is unusual, but it's good for the books that you have, right?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.481
Yes, yes.

16:00.541 --> 16:02.905
In the other rooms there are no problems at all.

16:02.925 --> 16:04.608
Very, very good.

16:04.628 --> 16:06.390
Because of the good circulation.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.153
Good circulation and cold.

16:12.098 --> 16:17.004
I love these vines.

16:17.184 --> 16:25.394
We're supposed to be walking in a vineyard.

16:25.755 --> 16:39.912
Covered with illustrations from Sheffier's Laplandia book on Lapland.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.674
from the end of the 17th century.

16:42.694 --> 16:49.445
And I took the... No, no, it's a bone from reindeer.

16:49.606 --> 16:50.527
Oh, really?

16:56.297 --> 16:56.397
Yeah.

16:56.417 --> 16:59.362
Oh, you have all the little pictures of the first edition of Islafonia.

17:00.364 --> 17:02.387
They were all taken from Islafonia.

17:02.407 --> 17:03.469
So it's contemporary.

17:03.702 --> 17:08.329
So tell me what this is, what is this, this is it?

17:08.450 --> 17:19.167
He wrote a very influential work about Lapland, but he didn't visit Lapland himself, it's a compilation of... Yeah, but these are pictures from the book to the book.

17:19.187 --> 17:20.028
Yes, yes, yes.

17:20.669 --> 17:28.161
And then these are copies of the illustrations from... Could you write down the book there?

17:28.181 --> 17:30.064
I'm going to take a picture of this thing.

17:33.267 --> 17:36.151
Approximately, how old is that book?

17:36.632 --> 17:38.935
1672, I think, was the first edition.

17:39.456 --> 17:44.563
And then there were several editions, very short after 17... What do you call this piece?

17:44.663 --> 17:47.528
We've got, I think... What, Cala Genselheim?

17:47.768 --> 17:51.814
It's a cabinet, of course.

17:53.937 --> 17:55.159
It's a cabinet, right?

17:55.179 --> 17:56.220
Yes, a cabinet, yes.

17:58.748 --> 18:06.538
Yes, it looks inside too because of the paper.

18:07.399 --> 18:10.443
That was quite exclusive at that time too.

18:12.306 --> 18:18.714
Is it a unique object or were there other... No, I don't think there are any others.

18:18.814 --> 18:20.837
So this is commissioned, one only?

18:21.097 --> 18:23.440
Scheffer, the owner of the library.

18:23.673 --> 18:25.075
He was related to?

18:25.095 --> 18:26.878
Yes, he was related to Schaefer.

18:27.078 --> 18:28.179
Okay.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.282
Who was the person again who owned this cabinet?

18:31.604 --> 18:34.188
This came in with this particular person who wrote these books?

18:34.208 --> 18:36.071
Yes, he came in with Schaefer.

18:36.231 --> 18:46.926
The same name without the U.S., which is the Latin ending, so he just... I think Schaefer, Schaefer was his grandfather's grandfather or something like that, yes.

18:46.966 --> 18:53.055
German scholar who was recruited to Uppsala University.

18:53.339 --> 18:54.661
What do you suppose you kept in that?

18:57.564 --> 18:59.066
Curiosities again, probably, right?

18:59.086 --> 19:01.049
What do you suppose they kept in that cabinet?

19:02.410 --> 19:05.975
It could be small pieces of Curiosities, even rings.

19:06.596 --> 19:09.739
The jewellery box, maybe?

19:10.020 --> 19:14.746
But you see, the wood is Swedish wood.

19:14.906 --> 19:16.648
Pear and pear.

19:16.668 --> 19:18.090
Pear tree, right?

19:18.510 --> 19:19.512
Yes.

19:19.732 --> 19:20.553
Pear?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.215
That's a fruit tree, right?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.988
with reindeer, corn.

19:27.091 --> 19:39.985
But it's interesting also because these are very conventional religious scenes, Adam and Eve in Eden, and then you find these exotic landscapes.

19:44.990 --> 19:45.871
What room are we in?

19:45.891 --> 19:47.393
Did you say Venice?

19:49.297 --> 20:11.473
with our very very young library from the beginning of the 19th century again quite spectacular

20:12.196 --> 20:28.660
It's the owner of the book, Magnus Brahe.

20:28.941 --> 20:29.702
And that book is?

20:29.722 --> 20:31.965
1840 or something?

20:32.005 --> 20:33.127
Yes.

20:33.888 --> 20:36.291
It's not a book of much interested.

20:37.253 --> 20:40.077
1844?

20:41.035 --> 20:42.156
He died that year.

20:42.176 --> 20:44.939
These are much different, these are more recent books, right?

20:46.060 --> 20:49.483
Yes, this is Magnus BrÃ¸d, did you say?

20:49.503 --> 20:50.624
Yes, yes.

20:50.644 --> 21:00.653
And this is actually the dedication copy, the copy to the one who... He didn't buy books, he got all his books.

21:00.673 --> 21:02.435
Ah, he had a high office.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.478
Yes, yes.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.920
He was very close to the king, Bernadotte.

21:08.744 --> 21:24.718
He was the translator of the king, actually.

21:27.561 --> 21:31.464
So was Nicholas going through all of these books, or was he looking for anything in particular?

21:31.484 --> 21:32.445
He just found this?

21:32.585 --> 21:37.890
Yes, just found it, because we had taken the other bestler in this room together with

21:38.090 --> 21:43.257
This is the first edition of Deathless, and it's a little destroyed.

21:43.337 --> 21:45.620
The body is destroyed, so it's kept like this.

21:46.502 --> 21:57.156
And yes, he was looking around here, and he said, what's that?

21:57.176 --> 22:01.182
And so, it's unfinished, but there were wonderful things.

22:01.222 --> 22:02.664
There were some leaves in there, too, actually.

22:02.744 --> 22:03.084
Yes.

22:05.127 --> 22:07.911
And this one is...

22:08.667 --> 22:09.508
Oh, yeah.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.329
Hold that open.

22:10.349 --> 22:11.050
That's great.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.533
I like it just like this.

22:13.613 --> 22:18.480
I like the picture.

22:20.362 --> 22:21.463
Beautiful.

22:21.483 --> 22:22.264
Is this a German?

22:22.865 --> 22:23.446
Yes, yes.

22:23.606 --> 22:23.786
Oh, yeah.

22:23.806 --> 22:25.068
Let's just stay right here.

22:25.128 --> 22:27.952
I'm a German number, probably.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.133
And also a war booty.

22:29.153 --> 22:30.034
Yes, yes, it is.

22:30.054 --> 22:30.835
He's a war booty.

22:30.855 --> 22:31.496
Yes.

22:31.516 --> 22:32.077
They're German.

22:32.317 --> 22:32.517
Oh, yes.

22:34.059 --> 22:37.764
Is this one in Nadine's field of research?

22:37.804 --> 22:38.505
Only printable.

22:39.008 --> 22:51.760
So just tell me again, do you have a title for this book?

22:52.360 --> 22:53.441
No, actually we haven't.

22:54.162 --> 23:04.211
It's a book of flowers from the beginning of the 17th century, made in German, probably from a nunnery.

23:06.993 --> 23:08.695
So these are all original paintings?

23:09.080 --> 23:09.841
Oh, yes.

23:10.421 --> 23:12.503
So obviously, how could he possibly know it?

23:12.683 --> 23:13.464
It's a unique book, right?

23:13.484 --> 23:15.586
Yes, but he apparently didn't know of it either.

23:15.626 --> 23:18.348
I mean, it could have been known in the literature.

23:18.388 --> 23:19.829
No, but it wasn't.

23:19.909 --> 23:20.510
But it wasn't.

23:20.570 --> 23:21.671
No one had noticed.

23:22.932 --> 23:24.553
Yes, early 17th century.

23:24.853 --> 23:25.814
And it's two volumes.

23:26.275 --> 23:27.416
Two volumes, yes.

23:27.456 --> 23:29.377
With many paintings of flowers.

23:29.497 --> 23:29.858
Yes.

23:30.959 --> 23:33.120
Are these watercolors, or what kind of... Yes.

23:33.140 --> 23:33.741
What would they be?

23:35.903 --> 23:36.964
It looks like watercolors.

23:37.845 --> 23:38.445
Wow, that's really beautiful.

23:39.134 --> 23:40.076
and unrecorded.

23:42.420 --> 23:46.687
How would you describe the quality of the paintings?

23:46.707 --> 23:46.948
Fine.

23:48.791 --> 23:53.559
And there is no printed... I mean, they're not done after a printed book, for example.

23:53.579 --> 23:58.487
I mean, they're just unique, the design is unique.

23:58.507 --> 23:59.810
You see, you could publish that.

24:00.611 --> 24:02.895
That's a facsimile.

24:03.156 --> 24:04.618
You can make a facsimile, I think, yes.

24:06.539 --> 24:10.367
It's a pretty good monograph for somebody to look into, actually.

24:10.407 --> 24:17.964
There's supposed to be flowers to be found in Germany, but even many flowers can be found here.

24:18.184 --> 24:21.932
What is that written about?

24:22.165 --> 24:26.812
So the artist did write some things in, and we're assuming it's a sheet.

24:27.152 --> 24:28.314
She also put some numbers.

24:28.354 --> 24:31.579
Why are you assuming it's a... Much is missing.

24:31.979 --> 24:34.824
Well, it seems that they're mainly garden plants, isn't that right?

24:35.084 --> 24:36.066
Are there trees as well?

24:36.086 --> 24:46.080
Yes, but I think there are some that can be... Because if it's only garden plants, that would seem reasonable to have... So can you name some of the flowers we've seen?

24:46.100 --> 24:47.262
Sunflowers?

24:47.798 --> 24:48.780
Geraniums.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.005
Geraniums, lilies.

24:52.025 --> 24:54.148
What's that?

24:54.168 --> 25:00.498
Lots of blank sheets, though, aren't there?

25:00.518 --> 25:02.822
Lots of blank sheets, yes.

25:02.842 --> 25:04.625
Put all the numbers on them.

25:04.885 --> 25:08.471
What is that?

25:08.812 --> 25:14.160
Lissimachia fedida.

25:14.377 --> 25:24.489
Oh, that was beautiful.

25:24.729 --> 25:27.012
Very heraldic.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.377
How do you spell it?

25:32.358 --> 25:39.847
Well, let's look at the delicate pink there.

25:42.610 --> 25:44.012
Is there any text at the front?

25:44.498 --> 25:46.501
Was there anything written at the front?

25:46.521 --> 25:51.089
No, but you see, there has been something taken away here.

25:51.469 --> 25:52.912
A plate or something?

25:52.932 --> 25:55.195
Yes, and maybe a name written there.

25:55.476 --> 25:57.619
A missing plate, tantalizing.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.505
They have tried to take it all away, but they haven't been successful.

26:02.948 --> 26:04.991
That might have indicated where it came from.

26:08.056 --> 26:10.099
So that's probably 30 Years War.

26:10.119 --> 26:11.822
30 Years War?

26:12.089 --> 26:13.210
And from where?

26:13.511 --> 26:13.871
Do we know?

26:13.931 --> 26:16.554
Germany.

26:19.858 --> 26:21.620
And also some of these are unfinished.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.942
Yes, yes.

26:23.022 --> 26:26.226
Lots of them are unfinished.

26:26.246 --> 26:27.968
Has anyone done a collation?

26:28.028 --> 26:29.630
Do you know how many pictures there are in there?

26:30.812 --> 26:33.955
Yes, but I don't remember.

26:33.975 --> 26:37.860
I think our past...

26:41.317 --> 27:09.096
chief created did it but is there a catalog leaf for this like the ones you showed yes yes yes it should be yes it should be yes i wonder how you cite it how would you know more about it so it's not secret at all i think it's important but isn't it probable that it has been attributed to germany because of the binding and that that

27:09.582 --> 27:12.186
Not the plants.

27:13.669 --> 27:17.755
It's the binding that makes you... Well, that's just my guess.

27:19.298 --> 27:20.800
That indicates it could be German.

27:22.002 --> 27:29.174
Well, it doesn't seem to me that there are many... There doesn't seem to be much in the inside to say this is a German book.

27:29.194 --> 27:33.821
Well, are the flowers, are the plants more in debit to Germany than they are... It could be, yes, of course.

27:34.503 --> 27:35.404
But usually...

27:36.194 --> 27:45.348
He's the one who's written this.

27:45.728 --> 27:49.333
So apparently the plants are German.

27:49.353 --> 27:55.823
So tell me who he is.

27:55.843 --> 28:04.075
Oh, so this is in 1920.

28:04.496 --> 28:05.998
Somebody wrote in 1920.

28:07.008 --> 28:09.371
This little piece of paper was signed in 1912.

28:09.571 --> 28:12.755
I don't know much about him, but he was a botanist.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.978
He was a famous botanist.

28:15.539 --> 28:16.120
Attributes.

28:18.042 --> 28:21.386
Well, plates.

28:22.167 --> 28:22.828
To Germany.

28:23.789 --> 28:36.205
What we're saying is that in 1912, a famous botanist looked at this and tried to give a preliminary

28:37.298 --> 28:43.107
evaluation of what it is and where it's from.

28:43.427 --> 28:45.410
So we could determine who made the paper?

28:45.891 --> 28:50.898
Yes, probably.

28:50.918 --> 28:56.907
It's difficult to know what he has chosen to attribute the pictures.

28:56.927 --> 29:05.280
What I'm saying is that there's an interesting monograph there for somebody who cares about... But it's difficult to say anything about the originality of these pictures.

29:05.665 --> 29:08.889
Also because there are blank leaves.

29:08.929 --> 29:15.696
If they're copied from... Somewhere in Germany.

29:16.077 --> 29:20.221
And the story about the nunnery, is that also because of the kind of flowers?

29:20.241 --> 29:21.362
Yes, yes, yes.

29:21.382 --> 29:24.646
I don't think they're being welcome.

29:24.666 --> 29:26.288
Ah, okay.

29:26.308 --> 29:30.052
Dr. Lindberg, whom we spoke about.

29:30.092 --> 29:30.913
I hope so.

29:31.079 --> 29:45.642
If there was a memory to be sacked, nice books, go get the books.

29:46.803 --> 29:52.793
But the pagination runs from 150, so there are five leaves, six leaves missing here.

29:54.676 --> 29:57.540
But this is only one place, I mean there could be others.

29:57.881 --> 29:58.842
Yes there are.

30:00.037 --> 30:04.441
47, and this is... What about the diamond or something?

30:05.082 --> 30:07.244
That was high in gold.

30:07.264 --> 30:07.965
Even the Italian one?

30:07.985 --> 30:25.302
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

30:28.252 --> 30:30.454
And the latest from 1844.

30:30.574 --> 30:35.338
So that was the while we held it.

30:35.939 --> 30:36.620
Yes, yes.

30:36.640 --> 30:40.543
But that was a book from the 1840s.

30:40.703 --> 30:41.184
Yes.

30:41.204 --> 30:43.426
From the last... Yes.

30:43.446 --> 30:51.033
So the inculnerable was a goodie, a stolen book, upon his birth?

30:51.173 --> 30:51.974
Yes, yes.

30:52.014 --> 30:53.935
That's a good way to get them.

30:53.955 --> 30:56.858
Yes, one of the collectors.

30:57.327 --> 31:04.078
There are a few that have been paid, but most of them would have.

31:04.098 --> 31:09.186
But the Bridget book can't have been stolen, okay?

31:09.446 --> 31:13.593
Yes, and it belonged to Per BrÃ¸y.

31:13.653 --> 31:17.499
Per BrÃ¸y, he was a relative.

31:17.519 --> 31:19.602
Birgitta was his ancestor.

31:20.463 --> 31:23.368
So it was part of his family's tradition.

31:23.737 --> 31:27.722
So you would have got it in Sweden rather than from the other part in February.

31:27.742 --> 31:28.483
That's good.

31:28.543 --> 31:31.407
That's good.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.129
Six copies.

31:33.189 --> 31:37.275
National Library and Paris.

31:39.278 --> 31:41.340
What is the actual title of the book?

31:41.440 --> 31:48.770
What do we call the book?

31:49.852 --> 31:51.654
The Last One.

31:51.674 --> 31:52.495
The Last One.

31:53.420 --> 32:07.501
When did the printing press first come into Sweden?

32:07.521 --> 32:08.983
The Swedish book was 1483.

32:09.223 --> 32:10.986
So it's pretty close.

32:11.026 --> 32:12.668
But this one wasn't printed in Sweden.

32:12.849 --> 32:15.152
No, it was printed in Germany.

32:15.212 --> 32:17.876
Because it was a project of such dignity.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.480
We couldn't make a book like that in Sweden.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.224
But it came to Sweden.

32:24.267 --> 32:31.616
She's our only saint.

32:34.439 --> 32:35.400
Who is truly a saint?

32:35.420 --> 32:35.780
We have St.

32:36.361 --> 32:36.962
Eric and St.

32:36.982 --> 32:38.203
Olaf.

32:38.323 --> 32:39.485
They're not saints, really.

32:39.565 --> 32:45.412
She actually got the popes to return from Avignon, according to some people.

32:45.812 --> 32:48.475
She was involved in that.

32:48.495 --> 32:50.157
When the European Union wanted to

32:50.339 --> 33:18.253
patron saint recently she was at least among the candidates but i don't know who the family chose i haven't heard it i hate to be on that because most of them are known in imperfect copies only and in one or two or three copies max so so they simply don't exist from the market yes loose leaves but but the swedish

33:18.723 --> 33:22.909
Small and ugly, and 16 frames.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.153
That's it?

33:25.173 --> 33:25.974
Yeah.

33:25.994 --> 33:26.254
16?

33:26.855 --> 33:31.682
Yeah.

33:32.423 --> 33:37.491
Imprints.

33:39.327 --> 33:41.190
I like it.

33:41.610 --> 33:43.553
I like it.

33:44.434 --> 33:46.157
I like it.

33:46.277 --> 33:47.819
I like it.

33:47.899 --> 33:48.821
I like it.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.404
I like it.

33:52.586 --> 33:55.250
I like it.

33:55.530 --> 34:02.500
Oh, my old son.

34:03.273 --> 34:04.874
Pause, pause, pause there.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.756
You can just hold the pen.

34:06.816 --> 34:12.641
I don't want the pen anywhere near.

34:12.661 --> 34:15.103
I know enough about pens.

34:15.263 --> 34:15.904
That's beautiful.

34:16.544 --> 34:19.487
This copy is twice as thick as a normal copy.

34:21.028 --> 34:23.430
Almost.

34:23.490 --> 34:28.814
Well, not quite, but an ordinary copy would be something.

34:28.954 --> 34:31.397
I'm glad that copies from the same date on paper.

34:31.497 --> 34:33.178
Oh, there is a paper copy in there.

34:33.479 --> 34:34.641
I can take it down, too.

34:36.163 --> 34:37.545
Oh, this is the true spectacular one.

34:37.785 --> 34:40.750
Yeah.

34:41.671 --> 34:42.512
Do we know the artist?

34:42.673 --> 34:42.993
Yes.

34:44.115 --> 34:44.655
Probably not.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.020
And that is the saint right there.

34:48.141 --> 34:49.142
See, right?

34:49.242 --> 34:49.322
Yes.

34:49.382 --> 34:49.823
Different scene.

34:50.204 --> 34:54.009
This woodcut is made up of six different woodcuts or something like that.

34:54.029 --> 34:54.690
And they're all like that.

34:55.091 --> 34:56.994
There are a few full-page illustrations.

34:57.014 --> 34:59.457
You guys can put your hands in.

34:59.537 --> 35:02.642
I like a little...

35:03.787 --> 35:04.428
Oh, that's great.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.770
It's just fine.

35:10.816 --> 35:11.597
Look at that.

35:11.737 --> 35:12.278
Feel it.

35:14.621 --> 35:20.328
It's incurable, and it's absolutely precious.

35:20.348 --> 35:22.951
There are a few famous pictures.

35:22.991 --> 35:26.876
Yes, it's a very velvety feeling.

35:26.916 --> 35:31.482
And this defect here, for example, is from the original skin, of course, hasn't it?

35:31.502 --> 35:32.724
Is this the first St.

35:32.744 --> 35:33.625
Bridget you've handled?

35:34.212 --> 35:38.356
Well, actually, we've sold a few copies.

35:38.457 --> 35:39.858
But there were only six.

35:40.559 --> 35:41.700
On vellum, yeah.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.180
On vellum.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.163
This is the first one on vellum.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.865
Yes, it is.

35:46.946 --> 35:48.868
And there's the paper copy.

35:49.008 --> 35:52.571
And there's actually a difference.

35:52.792 --> 35:54.574
These are different states as well.

35:54.994 --> 35:59.399
Because the vellum edition, some change was made.

35:59.439 --> 36:01.721
So there's one or two pages which are slightly different.

36:01.761 --> 36:03.443
But otherwise, they're identical.

36:04.756 --> 36:12.429
There's this little... I was just trying to find this Maistamathiyas, the scribe.

36:12.489 --> 36:14.933
There's one, a beautiful picture of her.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.396
What is she doing there?

36:16.516 --> 36:18.199
She's divinely inspired.

36:18.239 --> 36:28.857
These revelations are... I don't know.

36:29.022 --> 36:37.692
She came in with a trance, and she couldn't talk, and she got this revelation in daytime.

36:38.372 --> 36:43.018
This is Vita Sancta Birgitta, this is her life, and this is the end of the Revelaciones.

36:43.358 --> 36:46.161
I think Magister Mattias should be at the end of the Revelaciones.

36:46.401 --> 36:47.803
No?

36:47.823 --> 36:49.405
Okay, maybe we won't find it.

36:49.445 --> 36:51.107
Brigitte or Brigitte?

36:51.127 --> 36:56.413
Well, actually, she is Birgitta, but that's frequently translated into Brigitte.

36:56.433 --> 36:57.374
B-R-I-G-I-D?

36:58.055 --> 36:58.455
No, Brigitte.

36:58.655 --> 36:59.997
Bridget.

37:00.317 --> 37:01.799
Bridget.

37:02.300 --> 37:02.621
St.

37:02.661 --> 37:03.983
Bridget.

37:04.003 --> 37:15.359
But it's actually... Yeah, that's right.

37:15.379 --> 37:18.363
This is... There is one small wood for depicting a scribe.

37:19.665 --> 37:25.573
Now, this is the wood location and everything here, but no, I want to...

37:25.722 --> 37:27.584
Is this three-colour printing?

37:27.844 --> 37:28.064
No.

37:28.164 --> 37:32.368
No, you see this is the original letter printed here, and then it was rubricated.

37:35.511 --> 37:37.753
Why would there have been only six on vellum?

37:37.813 --> 37:40.155
So these must have been for royal presentation, would you say?

37:40.175 --> 37:42.257
Original letter there are 15.

37:43.778 --> 37:45.980
There were records to indicate 15?

37:46.000 --> 37:50.264
This is a full page, a true full page will cut, while the other ones are composite ones.

37:51.866 --> 37:54.128
So that would have been tipped in, so to speak.

37:54.148 --> 37:54.548
Yes.

37:55.642 --> 38:02.032
We can find this one towards the end.

38:04.236 --> 38:21.323
It's quite strange if you compare it with... Oh, there he is, Maester Mattias.

38:21.363 --> 38:21.784
Yes.

38:22.270 --> 38:23.752
But we should find this one.

38:23.772 --> 38:27.456
It should be truly magnificent if we find it.

38:29.438 --> 38:40.991
Explain, this is not the Bible.

38:41.652 --> 38:48.119
No, she was inspired, as she said, and she wrote down what she saw.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.383
Well, it's very political in context.

38:51.683 --> 38:59.116
Yes, she was accused of being very political.

38:59.136 --> 39:12.338
So she's like the national... I mean, we're a Protestant country, but she's... She named the different Italian politicians from the churchmen and the contemporary actions.

39:12.358 --> 39:13.880
Her period was when?

39:13.920 --> 39:16.645
The 14th century.

39:17.165 --> 39:18.748
06 or something.

39:18.768 --> 39:22.675
No, 1303 to 1373, I think she died.

39:24.538 --> 39:26.962
She was the 70s.

39:27.002 --> 39:38.042
She went to Rome and then she went on her pilgrimage to... Should I have any...

39:38.427 --> 39:46.275
These have to be studied.

39:46.315 --> 39:47.837
It's basically the same picture.

39:47.897 --> 39:49.418
No, it's not the same picture at all.

39:50.019 --> 39:51.821
Look at that up here.

39:51.901 --> 39:57.707
There is a copy in the clock of... This is the same page?

39:57.727 --> 39:59.108
No, not really, is it?

39:59.228 --> 39:59.929
It's a salvation.

40:03.813 --> 40:06.075
Maybe it's just... We'll create it later.

40:06.736 --> 40:08.097
We will find the identical.

40:08.347 --> 40:20.119
this copy with a copy in Norco 20 years ago, and there were differences, especially in colours, but also in... Even between the Valen copies?

40:20.159 --> 40:20.839
Yes, yes.

40:21.560 --> 40:24.803
But it's very odd, because this is the regular cellulose, so it should be the same.

40:24.903 --> 40:25.124
Yes.

40:28.327 --> 40:33.792
So even within a series along with different copies, the illustrations are not really the same.

40:33.812 --> 40:34.212
No, no.

40:34.232 --> 40:34.793
Interesting.

40:39.481 --> 40:44.467
This is a different one.

40:49.393 --> 40:59.404
So these are first printings by different states.

40:59.565 --> 41:00.806
But it's difficult to say exactly.

41:00.906 --> 41:02.288
One would have to study them very carefully.

41:02.768 --> 41:07.274
There have been studies in the... You see this?

41:07.774 --> 41:09.336
These are not the same.

41:09.687 --> 41:17.037
You see, this is the same text, but it's very different.

41:18.338 --> 41:30.955
This is the same text, with a different... These are different... It's a totally different type there, too.

41:30.975 --> 41:34.119
Look at how this is starting here, and how that's starting differently.

41:34.379 --> 41:37.743
And the size of the type up there is larger than down here.

41:37.763 --> 41:38.985
But that's probably...

41:39.539 --> 41:41.541
There are a few textual differences.

41:42.342 --> 41:47.409
Most pages you will find to be identical, but a few pages have been reset with consequences like this.

41:48.490 --> 41:50.653
But how about the end of the second column?

41:50.893 --> 41:52.094
Do they end with the same text?

41:53.196 --> 41:54.217
Well, they should.

41:54.257 --> 42:01.325
It's difficult to... Well, they should, but if they don't, then they... It's difficult to... Here it is.

42:03.368 --> 42:05.771
Let's go to the last word in the second column of each one.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.433
Is it the last word in the second column?

42:07.493 --> 42:08.234
No, that's not the same.

42:08.434 --> 42:09.175
It's not the same word.

42:09.931 --> 42:15.637
But one should have to make very sure that these are... What I'm saying is that the text is not the same.

42:16.177 --> 42:17.779
It's going to be different than just about every page.

42:17.799 --> 42:22.744
Yes, but there are a few initials which differ, and consequently the text will move accordingly.

42:22.764 --> 42:24.866
But I don't see how they could both be first editions, then.

42:25.987 --> 42:27.529
They're first editions in different states.

42:28.610 --> 42:29.190
Okay.

42:29.210 --> 42:33.274
Because if you change very, very much of the text, and you reset the text, you'll have a different edition.

42:33.294 --> 42:36.037
But even if the type is changed, it's still the first edition?

42:36.297 --> 42:37.679
Well, depending on how much it is.

42:38.580 --> 42:39.921
Okay.

42:40.087 --> 42:47.760
Because there has been, or at least you could call them different issues, if you like.

42:47.820 --> 42:50.565
These differences create different issues, maybe, but not a different edition.

42:50.585 --> 42:51.626
These are both the same year?

42:52.187 --> 42:53.109
Yes, 1492.

42:55.172 --> 42:56.695
That's very strange, very strange.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.341
But it's difficult to say.

42:58.381 --> 43:01.666
We would have to be very, very sure that these are corresponding pages.

43:02.127 --> 43:04.851
Yeah, of course, these are just a thing.

43:04.871 --> 43:05.632
These are just a thing.

43:05.672 --> 43:06.854
These are just a thing.

43:06.894 --> 43:08.196
They're just a thing.

43:08.376 --> 43:09.858
They're just a thing.

43:09.918 --> 43:11.481
They're just a thing.

43:11.501 --> 43:13.183
They're just a thing.

43:13.944 --> 43:14.946
They're just a thing.

43:15.066 --> 43:16.248
They're just a thing.

43:16.308 --> 43:17.670
They're just a thing.

43:17.750 --> 43:19.232
They're just a thing.

43:21.556 --> 43:24.680
They're just a thing.

43:24.700 --> 43:25.922
They're just a thing.

43:26.307 --> 43:55.504
and there was one very good book paper of course one in contemporary binding very nice copy and one leaves from five different copies had been assembled to make a copy well the good paper copy

43:56.024 --> 44:11.787
Because these exist on the market.

44:12.148 --> 44:13.690
I would have expected more.

44:14.712 --> 44:18.337
Yes, in fact, it's not extremely, but it's still a late incurable.

44:18.417 --> 44:20.300
I mean, 1492, for Sweden, that's incredible.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.762
Putting something like that on the market,

44:22.197 --> 44:27.082
I don't know, no idea.

44:27.443 --> 44:27.963
A million?

44:28.804 --> 44:29.505
More?

44:29.545 --> 44:29.946
More.

44:29.966 --> 44:30.867
A million?

44:30.927 --> 44:31.247
Maybe.

44:31.908 --> 44:40.637
Well, maybe not a million dollars now, but... Are there any privately owned or are they all institutionally owned?

44:41.598 --> 44:43.500
Are there any of these in private hands, I wonder?

44:43.661 --> 44:44.742
I don't think there are any.

44:44.762 --> 44:48.726
I don't think so, no.

44:48.746 --> 44:49.948
They're in public libraries?

44:50.388 --> 44:52.170
Yes, yes.

44:52.319 --> 44:56.664
No, there's one in the Royal Library, too.

44:56.724 --> 44:57.164
On Vellum.

44:57.184 --> 44:57.405
Yes.

44:58.446 --> 45:01.589
It came from a private collection.

45:03.351 --> 45:04.813
As a guess, I might purchase.

45:04.833 --> 45:12.321
No, I think it was.

45:12.662 --> 45:18.428
What would you say is the most important book in Sweden?

45:20.011 --> 45:20.712
Well, no.

45:21.193 --> 45:23.456
Or the silver Bible.

45:23.857 --> 45:24.438
The witch?

45:24.518 --> 45:26.281
Well, you know, I live in Uppsala.

45:26.321 --> 45:27.502
We say it's the silver Bible.

45:27.522 --> 45:29.065
They thought it was from Stockholm.

45:29.586 --> 45:32.230
The witch, though?

45:32.250 --> 45:32.330
Yes.

45:33.772 --> 45:39.421
Well, the silver Bible is the first document in a gothic family language.

45:39.481 --> 45:44.108
I mean, so it's a manuscript from 500 B.C., more or less.

45:44.929 --> 45:46.672
The volume is 500 B.C.?

45:46.772 --> 45:47.473
No, excuse me.

45:48.434 --> 45:48.955
Of course, A.D.

45:49.222 --> 45:50.303
It's from the year 500.

45:50.664 --> 45:55.050
All pages are colored and dyed in a purple, so they are red, the pages.

45:55.530 --> 46:00.577
And then the text is in silver, which has been more or less black now.

46:00.597 --> 46:03.221
It's called the Silver Bible, and that must be in the Royal Library.

46:03.341 --> 46:06.164
No, it's in the Uppsala International Library.

46:06.184 --> 46:06.985
One leaf was stolen.

46:07.106 --> 46:10.670
Any time you want to see a leaf, you come to Uppsala and it's on display.

46:11.031 --> 46:12.072
So one leaf.

46:12.092 --> 46:15.296
One leaf, because the mass of the book is kept.

46:15.377 --> 46:17.980
It's not found, so only one leaf is on display.

46:19.208 --> 46:20.469
You said one is stolen, though?

46:20.750 --> 46:23.533
One was stolen a few years ago, but it's impossible to sell.

46:23.793 --> 46:24.294
There's no way.

46:24.354 --> 46:25.075
But somebody has it.

46:25.415 --> 46:26.516
No, but they have to return.

46:26.937 --> 46:29.680
They discovered very quickly that they had stolen the wrong thing.

46:31.362 --> 46:32.764
They tore it out of the book?

46:32.784 --> 46:34.305
No, it was in a glass case.

46:34.686 --> 46:36.148
So they crashed the glass and they took the leaf.

46:36.548 --> 46:38.791
But without damage, they had been very careful.

46:39.331 --> 46:40.052
How did they return it?

46:40.753 --> 46:43.496
Well, they tried to sell it back to the government eventually, I think.

46:43.516 --> 46:44.778
That's what's happening in Boston.

46:44.878 --> 46:45.679
But they wouldn't pay.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.781
Because you can't start paying for them.

46:48.149 --> 46:52.435
Oh, you can, of course.

46:52.576 --> 46:53.757
I don't recognize that.

46:53.858 --> 46:57.563
No, because it was Italian.

46:57.583 --> 46:58.725
Oh, that's probably just us.

46:59.686 --> 47:01.669
Famous women.

47:01.729 --> 47:06.216
Now, what is this book?

47:06.817 --> 47:09.441
This is a 16th century book?

47:09.461 --> 47:10.743
No, no, no.

47:10.843 --> 47:12.826
Oh, in Indonesia?

47:12.866 --> 47:15.490
Yes, 1493, 1550.

47:17.984 --> 47:18.605
Okay.

47:18.645 --> 47:20.747
Ninety... Ninety-seven.

47:21.487 --> 47:22.428
Forty-nine-to-seven.

47:22.748 --> 47:23.769
How did this come in here?

47:24.890 --> 47:26.472
Again, Bodhi?

47:26.492 --> 47:26.572
Yes.

47:29.675 --> 47:30.416
Italian book.

47:30.836 --> 47:31.016
Yes.

47:32.057 --> 47:32.377
Venice.

47:34.800 --> 47:35.901
And do we know it?

47:35.921 --> 47:39.184
Do we have a name, a title for it?

47:39.244 --> 47:40.645
Yes.

47:43.988 --> 47:45.730
Go down the...

47:46.773 --> 48:08.738
But you see it's the same picture.

48:09.860 --> 48:12.743
Yes, yes.

48:12.763 --> 48:14.485
Just the same picture several times.

48:14.988 --> 48:15.809
for different women.

48:15.949 --> 48:18.012
Apostola, Huberorum.

48:19.393 --> 48:20.394
Who are some of the women?

48:20.414 --> 48:21.195
Do we know them?

48:21.215 --> 48:23.158
Many of them are unknown to us.

48:23.178 --> 48:24.860
A martyr called Saint Anastasia.

48:26.241 --> 48:28.905
Anastasia Nobilissima, Romanorum.

48:29.185 --> 48:36.374
So maybe religious... Well, but there ought to be some from heathen mythology as well, because there are quite a few.

48:38.116 --> 48:40.118
I mean, you don't expect to see Cullopatra in there.

48:40.317 --> 48:43.722
No, we're not Cleopatra, but it's Santa Rosina, Sekunda.

48:43.762 --> 48:44.924
We are martyrs, apparently.

48:45.024 --> 48:46.346
How are you arrangered?

48:46.366 --> 48:48.289
Is it Bokstufoning?

48:48.309 --> 48:48.689
No.

48:49.030 --> 48:52.234
It's about Marianas, Hebrea, Femina.

48:52.915 --> 48:55.138
Joan of Arc should be in there, you'd think.

48:55.159 --> 48:57.923
Venturi, yeah.

48:57.943 --> 49:01.408
Sybilla, Tiburtina, I mean, that's not very... Is it mostly a Talib?

49:01.868 --> 49:02.689
No, they have a Talib.

49:02.709 --> 49:07.236
This is a Vestal Virgin, actually, so it's also ancient history.

49:09.241 --> 49:35.299
I wonder how easy they had to read this.

49:38.080 --> 49:41.283
That's Italian too, do you think?

49:41.563 --> 49:43.845
No, this is Latin, yeah.

49:46.168 --> 49:47.669
No, this is from Germany.

49:47.769 --> 49:49.891
Oh, is it from Germany?

49:50.011 --> 49:51.613
Oh, yeah.

49:52.474 --> 49:53.635
It's even better.

49:53.735 --> 49:56.898
1456?

49:56.938 --> 50:06.467
1656 is pretty damn close to the... To the invention of the...

50:14.513 --> 50:17.857
Membranar meaning vellum.

50:17.897 --> 50:21.501
So they were very proud of this printable.

50:21.521 --> 50:22.923
Anvil 66.

50:23.043 --> 50:24.204
It's, yeah, I now remember.

50:24.244 --> 50:25.386
It's printed in Mainz.

50:26.166 --> 50:29.370
Which is really... Mainz incunable.

50:30.371 --> 50:31.112
In vellum.

50:31.372 --> 50:33.455
This is a library in itself.

50:34.016 --> 50:34.676
Incunable.

50:35.998 --> 50:37.099
Anvil 1466.

50:38.781 --> 50:39.302
Cicero.

50:40.123 --> 50:41.644
Is the subject of Cicero?

50:41.664 --> 50:42.205
Yes.

50:42.225 --> 50:43.947
Cicero de officis.

50:44.855 --> 50:50.583
O-F-F.

50:51.385 --> 50:51.565
C-I-S.

50:52.546 --> 50:53.908
That's pretty spectacular.

50:54.409 --> 50:55.531
Is there a coliform?

50:56.192 --> 50:56.893
Yes.

50:56.933 --> 50:57.834
Printed in red.

50:59.036 --> 51:00.058
It's pretty close.

51:00.438 --> 51:00.979
It's a time.

51:01.460 --> 51:02.561
It's difficult to see what it says.

51:04.444 --> 51:08.410
But it must be a man... ...or something like that.

51:11.154 --> 51:12.516
Even more here.

51:13.002 --> 51:15.685
Yes, post.

51:16.086 --> 51:27.860
It's post?

51:31.845 --> 51:41.457
Oh, come on.

51:42.230 --> 51:46.655
And they should say, I don't remember now what the Latin word for Mainz is.

51:46.675 --> 51:47.796
But... Mogunt.

51:47.816 --> 51:48.797
Yes, Mogunt, yeah, yeah.

51:48.817 --> 51:49.438
So that's it.

51:49.598 --> 51:50.880
M stands for Mogunt.

51:51.420 --> 51:54.804
So it says, roughly translated, roughly.

51:55.225 --> 51:58.508
Well, the problem is I can't read it all because it's difficult to see what it says.

51:58.548 --> 52:00.791
Okay, but what you see is the word for Mainz.

52:00.911 --> 52:02.993
Well, it says opus Johannes Fusti.

52:03.634 --> 52:05.676
Magdeburg, no, Mogunti.

52:06.257 --> 52:06.758
In 1466.

52:06.778 --> 52:08.900
The work of, yes.

52:08.920 --> 52:09.901
Mainz, 1466.

52:10.001 --> 52:11.663
This is true.

52:11.761 --> 52:16.788
And this was brought to this library by whom, you think?

52:16.888 --> 52:18.530
Carl Gustav Bielke.

52:19.051 --> 52:23.357
Carl Gustav, what was the last part?

52:24.979 --> 52:25.680
Bielke.

52:26.542 --> 52:26.762
B-I-E.

52:27.343 --> 52:28.705
And he had bought it.

52:29.145 --> 52:30.928
He bought this?

52:30.988 --> 52:35.214
Yes, he bought it.

52:35.234 --> 52:35.634
Are you sure?

52:35.654 --> 52:35.794
Yes.

52:35.875 --> 52:37.617
Here is the building, 1739.

52:37.732 --> 52:39.754
And in fact, this is the typical Swedish 1735.

52:39.834 --> 52:41.316
Okay, tell me what it says back here.

52:41.736 --> 52:45.120
On the back, the binding, well, we can't read this.

52:45.180 --> 52:46.361
This is the cost of the binding.

52:46.862 --> 52:49.525
This is when he bought it, 23 October 1739.

52:49.765 --> 52:50.966
The price of the binding.

52:51.567 --> 52:52.688
And he always tells.

52:52.708 --> 52:53.929
And what's the price of the binding?

52:53.949 --> 52:54.950
Did he buy it in JÃ¤vle?

52:55.070 --> 53:01.257
Yes, no, no, it was a distinct, oh, it was a distinct, but it has been bought.

53:02.859 --> 53:04.380
Who was the one who gave it to me?

53:05.101 --> 53:05.882
I don't remember.

53:07.702 --> 53:08.623
Is that his signature?

53:09.064 --> 53:09.885
Yes, yes, oh yes.

53:10.085 --> 53:16.875
And he had it bound, which is why he writes this, the binding costs.

53:16.895 --> 53:20.440
So maybe he got an original binding and destroyed it.

53:22.363 --> 53:26.028
This is in the front case now, right?

53:26.228 --> 53:27.971
Yes.

53:27.991 --> 53:31.836
And what he has indicated there is that he got it.

53:32.288 --> 53:35.493
He tells that it was a gift.

53:39.781 --> 53:43.327
He was a governor in GÃ¤vle.

53:43.667 --> 53:51.380
It's quite mysterious because he almost always tells who gave him a book, but he doesn't tell us.

53:51.961 --> 53:55.427
It's simply a gift in the city of GÃ¤vle.

53:55.913 --> 53:58.236
Contemporary or?

53:58.256 --> 54:00.740
Yes, contemporary.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.802
Because it's spelled differently.

54:02.842 --> 54:07.309
And then the cost of the binding, but I can't read this.

54:07.329 --> 54:09.411
That's okay.

54:11.514 --> 54:17.162
This little label.

54:17.227 --> 54:22.033
This is very interesting because this is when they were about to sell the books in the 16th.

54:22.234 --> 54:24.396
They had started to mark the books for selling them.

54:24.416 --> 54:30.665
So what we see down here is a little preliminary label, preparatory to selling.

54:31.245 --> 54:34.309
So we never discussed this library was going to be disposed of.

54:34.330 --> 54:37.914
16, no, 1965-1966.

54:40.458 --> 54:41.839
And this is when they were privately owned?

54:41.859 --> 54:43.842
Yes, yes, last private years.

54:44.058 --> 54:46.240
They bought it in 1967.

54:46.260 --> 54:48.142
What did the state pay, do you know?

54:48.162 --> 54:49.023
25 million.

54:49.303 --> 54:49.664
Dollars?

54:49.904 --> 54:52.386
No, crowns.

54:52.406 --> 54:53.107
That's nothing.

54:53.127 --> 54:55.509
Was that even cheap then?

54:55.590 --> 54:57.572
I don't know how it would be.

54:57.592 --> 55:04.318
No, it was quite cheap, given at that time, I think.

55:04.338 --> 55:05.359
I'm sorry, what?

55:05.379 --> 55:08.783
It's only... It's only the castle and the park.

55:08.803 --> 55:08.923
I see.

55:09.083 --> 55:14.048
No lands to it, because the last family, Funessa family, they kept

55:14.112 --> 55:14.853
They kept the land.

55:15.834 --> 55:18.097
That's why they're farming out there.

55:22.422 --> 55:25.485
You see how I asked you to look at the cauliflower, didn't I?

55:25.505 --> 55:27.007
I said, let's look at the cauliflower.

55:27.147 --> 55:28.909
Yes, but we had looked at it, but we weren't able to read.

55:28.969 --> 55:29.950
Because it's difficult.

55:29.970 --> 55:30.952
It's printed in red.

55:31.072 --> 55:32.834
So first we weren't able to see what it says.

55:34.055 --> 55:35.136
Because it's difficult to see.

55:35.357 --> 55:38.480
Here it says Fust, but it's almost impossible to see.

55:38.520 --> 55:38.981
There it is.

55:39.181 --> 55:39.381
Yes.

55:40.423 --> 55:42.465
So because the date is on the last line.

55:43.002 --> 55:59.678
How does this come into the possession?

56:00.164 --> 56:01.466
This is the action ball, though?

56:01.526 --> 56:03.028
We don't know.

56:03.048 --> 56:09.216
17th century.

56:09.537 --> 56:22.294
But if it was bought, or if it probably was taken, but we don't know from what place it was taken.

56:22.435 --> 56:24.978
So we don't even know the prior owner of that one?

56:24.998 --> 56:25.699
No, we don't.

56:25.932 --> 56:29.456
That's one of the most famous bibliographic paintings there.

56:29.476 --> 56:31.759
It's not, it's made on camera.

56:31.879 --> 56:32.860
It's painted on camera.

56:32.880 --> 56:36.404
The other Asimbaldo, the Bertumnus, is painted on wood.

56:36.665 --> 56:37.426
That's right.

56:38.427 --> 56:40.890
This is probably going to reflect, but I'm going to try it anyway.

56:43.112 --> 56:46.416
You have good reproductions of the library.

56:46.436 --> 56:49.560
I want to get it in situ, as we say.

56:51.211 --> 56:57.301
It might, because I think the flash went that way.

57:00.727 --> 57:03.312
That's the original, right?

57:03.352 --> 57:10.384
The reproductions mean nothing to me.
