WEBVTT

00:03.912 --> 00:05.995
Why is this going so fast?

00:06.015 --> 00:08.379
Okay, we're talking to it late.

00:09.060 --> 00:12.085
Okay, and we're in Cornell here.

00:12.105 --> 00:14.329
Just don't even think about that thing in Twitter.

00:14.349 --> 00:20.338
Okay, and what we're going to look at is World Wide Web.

00:20.358 --> 00:20.979
Okay.

00:20.999 --> 00:27.089
And we have some very specific uses that we see for the web.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.274
We don't see it as ever replacing our materials.

00:30.676 --> 00:32.238
We have the real thing.

00:32.258 --> 00:35.362
That's the first thing you said to me.

00:35.442 --> 00:45.635
That's the first thing we say, is that for virtually everything, these are not preservation copies, this is for access.

00:45.655 --> 00:54.767
And that's a terribly important distinction because people are always saying, well, aren't we going to just be able to throw everything out and just have the digital copy?

00:54.927 --> 00:56.990
Because there are people that say that, though.

00:57.010 --> 00:59.333
There are people who say it all the time.

00:59.988 --> 01:03.552
They kind of say, well, perhaps that's our job security.

01:03.572 --> 01:07.175
In the future, libraries will become book archives.

01:07.195 --> 01:10.018
I heard that here yesterday.

01:10.038 --> 01:10.398
Oh, yeah.

01:10.418 --> 01:14.002
In the context of a colleague of yours.

01:14.022 --> 01:20.308
He said, you know, by the year 2000, we can only have five million books here.

01:20.328 --> 01:21.229
And so what are we going to do?

01:21.249 --> 01:21.730
You tell me.

01:22.230 --> 01:29.978
Well, certainly the books we have are books that we have because they have some more effects on it.

01:31.088 --> 01:36.560
And that's what, I think, the difference between a rare book, however you define it.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.206
And a rare book may be a book that's published today.

01:40.609 --> 01:40.930
Of course.

01:41.010 --> 01:45.280
But it's a book that, for some reason, the physical part of that.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.287
Yeah, I mean, there were worthless books that were published 200 years ago.

01:48.307 --> 01:48.507
Of course.

01:49.043 --> 01:52.927
And there were exceedingly scarce books published five years ago.

01:52.948 --> 01:56.772
So the timing is really not necessarily relevant, I guess.

01:56.792 --> 02:01.898
And certainly in the archives, there are things that are unique, but not particularly rare.

02:01.918 --> 02:02.819
There you go.

02:02.839 --> 02:05.262
I have hundreds of students' scrapbooks.

02:05.282 --> 02:07.164
You can have some of mine if you want.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.907
They are unique, but they are not rare.

02:11.709 --> 02:16.755
So part of what we've tried to do is

02:17.765 --> 02:20.668
We do a lot of exhibits in our exhibit gallery.

02:20.949 --> 02:27.776
The exhibits last for three months because we don't want to keep material out for very long.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.179
We might be bad for it.

02:30.319 --> 02:32.121
Exhibits have certain intrinsic problems.

02:32.642 --> 02:33.362
You can't see pages.

02:33.383 --> 02:35.205
You can't see the back of the letters.

02:36.146 --> 02:44.955
So we have experimented with putting several of our exhibits up as websites.

02:44.975 --> 02:46.337
And the first one

02:46.756 --> 02:53.783
It's not the first one that we did, but it has some other interesting aspects to it.

02:53.863 --> 02:55.805
It's an exhibit on Ezra Cornell.

02:55.885 --> 02:59.048
And Ezra Cornell, of course, is the founder of the university.

03:00.309 --> 03:03.172
But that wasn't how I wanted to see him.

03:03.192 --> 03:03.452
Yeah, yeah.

03:03.472 --> 03:06.255
This is an internet connection.

03:06.275 --> 03:07.316
Don't try this at home.

03:07.336 --> 03:08.297
It's not so fast.

03:08.377 --> 03:12.200
I would be probably up here right now.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.923
With a 28-8 modem, it's not so fast.

03:15.545 --> 03:18.048
And that's, of course, a problem.

03:18.068 --> 03:19.610
We understand that.

03:19.630 --> 03:31.924
In fact, people may want to turn off pictures if they're really doing it at home and just read the text and then get a picture selectively.

03:31.944 --> 03:34.327
But I can punch you into this from my computer?

03:34.347 --> 03:34.728
Absolutely.

03:34.768 --> 03:36.830
Anywhere in the world.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.093
So this is how do I do it?

03:39.113 --> 03:42.717
This is just, it's rnc-www.library.cornell.com.

03:43.490 --> 03:54.628
I can give you a bookmark.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.051
Bookmark, bookmark.

03:56.071 --> 03:58.315
In Netscape they have something called bookmarks.

03:59.116 --> 03:59.997
This is a bookmark.

04:00.057 --> 04:03.363
This could almost be a collectible item.

04:03.784 --> 04:05.166
We have several.

04:05.226 --> 04:07.510
We're doing a set.

04:07.951 --> 04:10.054
And what that will get you to is the

04:10.473 --> 04:18.925
general home page, which will, in fact, come very quickly regardless of your computer, because it's just that.

04:18.945 --> 04:28.458
And then you want to go to exhibits and events, and then you can go to any more exhibits.

04:28.478 --> 04:28.578
Okay.

04:28.598 --> 04:30.721
And so it's really, so we're going to initially become no one.

04:33.464 --> 04:39.012
And what I tried to do in this exhibit was to use this

04:39.430 --> 04:43.153
Family collection, because that's what it really is.

04:43.173 --> 04:43.754
Now, may I just interrupt?

04:43.774 --> 04:45.215
This is an online exhibit?

04:45.235 --> 04:46.396
This is an online exhibit.

04:46.416 --> 04:50.219
It was a real exhibit last week in the gallery.

04:50.239 --> 04:50.940
Because this is new to me.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.162
I've not seen an online exhibit before.

04:53.182 --> 04:53.802
Oh, okay.

04:53.822 --> 04:56.444
This is what... Are there any others that you know?

04:57.025 --> 04:59.407
Oh, there's lots of them, yeah.

04:59.427 --> 05:03.610
And it's becoming a real trend for people to do because it gives you a nice record of what you've done.

05:04.211 --> 05:05.612
And allows you to use your things.

05:05.632 --> 05:09.015
It's a little... We've done printed catalogs and...

05:09.603 --> 05:11.385
This is a different theme.

05:11.405 --> 05:11.886
Okay.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.088
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

05:13.108 --> 05:13.688
No, no, please.

05:13.708 --> 05:16.712
Don't interrupt me at any point.

05:16.732 --> 05:21.359
Because you're very simply stop realizing when you're talking about it.

05:21.379 --> 05:22.080
You're not saying that's fine.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.562
Why don't you know why am I jumping in?

05:23.662 --> 05:24.142
No, no.

05:24.222 --> 05:29.870
As I say, it was one of the very surprising things that I learned is that you start using terms.

05:29.890 --> 05:33.795
And the terms that everybody knows, of course.

05:33.815 --> 05:34.556
But they don't.

05:34.576 --> 05:37.300
If I don't, I never hesitate.

05:37.320 --> 05:37.500
Go ahead.

05:37.683 --> 05:40.847
And I am computer literate.

05:40.867 --> 05:45.734
So this, in fact, this is the title page, in fact.

05:45.754 --> 05:47.256
This was an introduction.

05:47.276 --> 05:48.958
This was the first case.

05:48.978 --> 05:53.484
And there was a physical case that had this text and these images.

05:54.406 --> 05:58.291
It didn't have this on the top.

05:58.311 --> 06:00.874
And it allows you to go back to the beginning.

06:00.914 --> 06:02.897
We have a timeline.

06:03.535 --> 06:05.638
There is a guide to the collection.

06:05.798 --> 06:10.864
Actually, this is based on a big manuscript collection, the papers and Ezra Cornell.

06:10.884 --> 06:18.754
You can ask a question of a reference person, send an email to a reference person, or you can go back to the home page, and that's all done with stuff.

06:18.774 --> 06:28.767
But the premise of this exhibit was that, in many ways, Ezra Cornell personified a lot of what was going on in the 19th century.

06:28.787 --> 06:30.910
Here was this individual who was born to a poor family,

06:31.514 --> 06:35.900
He struggles for most of his life.

06:36.260 --> 06:41.848
He's involved in the major technological revolution of the 19th century, the telegraph.

06:41.868 --> 06:53.965
And he, through 19th century business practices, in fact, winds up a big chunk of Western Union stock in his late 15s, has a lot of money.

06:53.985 --> 06:54.566
It's a great story.

06:54.586 --> 06:57.490
What do we immediately do when he discovers he has a lot of money?

06:57.510 --> 06:59.713
He tries to figure out how to give it away.

06:59.733 --> 07:00.053
And so you have

07:00.860 --> 07:09.329
Here a picture of him as a young man.

07:10.250 --> 07:16.597
And then you have, he has a ciphering book that he put together.

07:16.677 --> 07:18.439
It's a nice image.

07:18.459 --> 07:25.867
And this image was taken, a photograph was taken of the book, a slide actually.

07:25.947 --> 07:26.648
It was a slide.

07:34.171 --> 07:36.394
I see.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.418
And the photo CDs come from here.

07:39.438 --> 07:51.153
Well, they look a bit like this, although this is not actually a photo CD, but they look like three rounds.

07:51.173 --> 07:54.017
And so we can click on this to make it bigger.

07:54.037 --> 07:55.078
Let me see what the... This was all designed?

07:55.839 --> 08:01.687
This was designed here, and I hope the person who informed the people who designed it won't join us, actually.

08:01.707 --> 08:02.828
Do you call these people engineers?

08:03.618 --> 08:10.085
No, the person who designed it has a background.

08:10.105 --> 08:12.468
She has a master's in communication.

08:12.869 --> 08:13.589
She's already up and down.

08:14.270 --> 08:29.228
And she really has... I think what's interesting with the website is that now the technology is not so important to design it.

08:29.248 --> 08:30.309
The technology is there.

08:30.329 --> 08:32.391
It's not quite transparent.

08:32.411 --> 08:33.152
It's not quite...

08:33.537 --> 08:37.322
up to sort of word processing.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.524
This is more like my speed.

08:38.544 --> 08:40.006
Yeah, I don't know why this is so slow.

08:40.086 --> 08:47.075
And that's interesting that it does really, in fact, change speed a little bit.

08:48.216 --> 08:53.043
The server for this is actually down the hall.

08:53.623 --> 09:01.654
So you'd think that would be rather fast, but in fact it's actually going through the network, through the server, back to the network, back to us.

09:01.955 --> 09:05.920
The physical proximity is not relevant.

09:06.060 --> 09:14.271
This is very relevant.

09:14.291 --> 09:18.216
In any case, he's doing something else.

09:18.236 --> 09:20.159
But you can talk.

09:20.179 --> 09:27.929
So in any event, he immediately decides he's got to give away the community.

09:27.949 --> 09:29.691
His children are run out.

09:29.711 --> 09:30.192
They're all established.

09:30.212 --> 09:31.253
The first thing he does is fund the public library.

09:31.655 --> 09:43.371
Then later he writes to his attorneys and says, well, the phone library's only cost me about $70,000.

09:43.391 --> 09:45.935
I still have a lot of money.

09:45.955 --> 09:48.478
What am I going to do?

09:49.399 --> 09:55.388
And that's when it's involved with the insurance.

09:55.408 --> 09:55.868
For what year was this?

09:55.888 --> 09:56.329
About 1863, 1864.

10:05.860 --> 10:28.146
But he talks about a favorable change in the cage above, which promised to give a favorable turn to the lifelong loss and gain account continues.

10:28.166 --> 10:32.931
The yearly income which I will realize this year will exceed $100,000.

10:33.046 --> 10:35.869
Now I can punch this up with a copy of it.

10:35.889 --> 10:36.930
Yep, exactly.

10:36.950 --> 10:54.888
But my greatest care is how to spend this large income to do the most good to those who are properly dependent on age, to the poor and to the poor.

10:54.908 --> 10:56.189
It's a great sentiment.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.111
How long have you been doing this kind of thing?

10:58.131 --> 10:58.952
This particular kind of thing?

10:59.894 --> 11:15.613
Well, 40 Billion and Evolution, we started in 19, really in 1992, with the first project to do digital images of images, in other words, not of text.

11:15.633 --> 11:24.965
And that was a project that was a product in cooperation with Kodak.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.627
But it's called Kodak, a kind of hybrid image consortium where they can.

11:27.721 --> 11:43.441
So it's K-O-I-C.

11:46.585 --> 11:46.745
K-O-I-C.

11:46.765 --> 11:46.925
K-O-I-C.

11:46.945 --> 11:48.788
K-O-I-C.

11:48.808 --> 11:48.968
K-O-I-C.

11:48.988 --> 11:49.609
K-O-I-C.

11:52.392 --> 11:52.552
K-O-I-C.

11:52.572 --> 11:52.733
K-O-I-C.

11:52.753 --> 11:52.913
K-O-I-C.

11:52.933 --> 11:53.093
K-O-I-C.

11:53.113 --> 11:53.273
K-O-I-C.

11:53.293 --> 11:53.453
K-O-I-C.

11:53.473 --> 11:53.634
K-O-I-C.

11:53.654 --> 11:53.814
K-O-I-C.

11:53.834 --> 11:53.994
K-O-I-C.

11:54.014 --> 11:54.174
K-O-I-C.

11:54.194 --> 11:54.355
K-O-I-C.

11:54.375 --> 11:54.535
K-O-I-C.

11:54.555 --> 11:54.715
K-O-I-C.

11:54.735 --> 11:54.895
K-O-I-C.

11:54.915 --> 11:55.076
K-O-I-C.

11:55.096 --> 11:55.256
K-O-I-C.

11:55.276 --> 11:55.436
K-O-I-C.

11:55.456 --> 11:55.616
K-O-I-C.

11:55.636 --> 11:55.796
K-O-I-C.

11:55.816 --> 11:55.977
K-O-I-C.

11:55.997 --> 11:56.157
K-O-I-C.

11:56.177 --> 11:56.277
K-O-I

11:57.100 --> 12:16.642
of anthropological art.

12:16.662 --> 12:19.765
And we tried university photographs that were in microtons that were left to explain that, going from microtons to digital.

12:19.785 --> 12:21.347
So photographs didn't really work very much.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.528
What you were putting in wasn't sufficiently high quality.

12:22.548 --> 12:24.871
And so what we got out was we tried with some oversized drawings, architectural drawings of a tunnel in John Lohan.

12:24.891 --> 12:26.112
And that was mixed with that.

12:26.615 --> 12:38.194
But certainly in terms of photographs and artwork and items like that, it was very successful.

12:38.215 --> 12:50.395
And so, for instance, you can see in case of, we'll go on to, well, the telegraph.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.984
This was a case.

12:56.004 --> 12:58.348
This was a case on a telegraph.

13:02.796 --> 13:12.994
No, we actually, because the text was machine readable, you could just put it into an HTML script.

13:13.014 --> 13:14.998
You can see what it looks like, actually.

13:21.762 --> 13:23.985
That's what's behind Bokeh.

13:25.047 --> 13:28.973
And so it's telling it what to do with the title.

13:29.454 --> 13:31.657
And it's really just the text.

13:31.677 --> 13:36.305
I know they say the text was just the file that we're reading in.

13:36.325 --> 13:37.727
And so the text is there.

13:38.127 --> 13:41.653
And then it tells it, here are its pictures.

13:41.673 --> 13:44.878
Now, of course, you're doing this with a physical exhibit.

13:44.978 --> 13:45.559
Right.

13:45.877 --> 13:52.543
Was the temptation such that the rich resources of the collections that you could do something?

13:52.563 --> 13:53.023
There wasn't physical.

13:53.043 --> 13:56.006
There wasn't physical, but that's entirely online, I guess.

13:56.026 --> 13:57.467
Sure, yeah.

13:57.487 --> 14:00.950
And have you done that?

14:00.970 --> 14:01.491
Mm-hmm.

14:01.511 --> 14:07.296
Well, again, I'm saying with an exhibit, you can show different sides of the letter.

14:07.316 --> 14:13.021
Obviously, in the case, we can only show one side, but in the case, it was small.

14:13.041 --> 14:13.841
You can only get a very different thing.

14:13.861 --> 14:14.702
With the example of a book,

14:15.003 --> 14:20.630
We often take one page and imagine you could show the whole book, really.

14:20.770 --> 14:21.171
Oh, sure.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.232
Yes, indeed.

14:22.252 --> 14:30.943
We didn't do that in this exhibit, but I would have liked to.

14:30.963 --> 14:34.768
And this does, you know, there are some campaign items from a political campaign.

14:34.828 --> 14:38.573
It's, you know, it's kind of an interesting thing.

14:38.593 --> 14:41.517
But what's particularly, the other thing that this really does,

14:42.745 --> 15:05.610
is it allows you to go to the guide to the collection, which is really terrifying.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.032
So what's codex involved with the line?

15:07.585 --> 15:21.107
At this point, really, they're still developing some of the other student technologies.

15:21.127 --> 15:28.719
But does this research, are you necessarily doing research or are you basically practicing things that are developed, I guess?

15:28.739 --> 15:30.041
We're basically practicing things.

15:30.061 --> 15:31.864
And they're evaluating what we've done.

15:31.884 --> 15:33.306
It is a semiotic kind of a thing.

15:33.927 --> 15:36.850
So if you click here, now this will get you to something else.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.992
And you may have heard about Making of America.

15:40.793 --> 15:50.461
And the interface that you're seeing here is really one of the suggestions for Making of America interface.

15:50.481 --> 15:53.744
So this is a guide to the culture.

15:53.764 --> 15:58.008
And you can answer to the entire Ezra Cornell papers.

15:58.969 --> 16:00.030
This is just right.

16:00.130 --> 16:02.652
And it is actually a physical book.

16:07.407 --> 16:13.714
Did you have these connections for all of the collections?

16:13.734 --> 16:16.297
We had them for a lot, actually, before.

16:16.317 --> 16:27.709
We had probably about 8,000 collections here, nearly 40,000 to the students here.

16:27.729 --> 16:32.214
And is there a ton of anything that you have across that thing?

16:32.234 --> 16:37.279
We probably have a reasonable level of control of those activities.
