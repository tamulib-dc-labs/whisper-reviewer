00:02.765 --> 00:12.860
Tell me a little bit about the history of this library.

00:12.920 --> 00:19.710
They say this is one of the oldest continuous libraries in the world.

00:19.730 --> 00:26.781
Yes, one of the oldest preserved from the region until now.

00:32.971 --> 00:34.033
This is beautiful.

00:34.333 --> 00:38.780
The original door, good and good.

00:42.006 --> 00:43.989
The original door, the date.

00:44.029 --> 00:44.289
1454.

00:44.490 --> 00:44.930
Wow.

00:47.434 --> 00:48.356
And that says 1454.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.282
August 15.

00:55.227 --> 00:55.367
Mm-hmm.

00:55.752 --> 01:07.772
And the name of the craftsman who made the door, Christophorov, from St.

01:07.792 --> 01:14.984
John and Pesticheto, which is a little town near Bologna.

01:15.705 --> 01:22.536
But the name of the architect is Master Muzi.

01:25.013 --> 01:31.241
May I take a photograph?

01:31.401 --> 01:37.549
I understand, that's why I asked.

01:37.589 --> 01:43.536
We have a postcard if you want.

01:43.556 --> 01:44.878
That's fine.

01:45.685 --> 01:47.810
What is the elephant?

01:47.850 --> 01:55.328
The elephant was a symbol of the Malatesta family.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.517
This is a form of the Malatesta family.

01:59.537 --> 02:02.344
Yes, Domenico.

02:04.636 --> 02:24.518
Domenico, whose name was also Novello, was the brother of Sigismondo, who was the lord of the ring.

02:27.755 --> 02:29.779
So this was a private library?

02:29.819 --> 02:31.261
This was a family library?

02:31.642 --> 02:34.006
No, not exactly.

02:36.751 --> 02:42.321
It was a library built in a consistent common.

02:42.689 --> 03:11.987
by the law of the city but it was not a family library but a sort of public library in the sense in which we

03:11.967 --> 03:27.867
we do to the public library in 15th century, in a particular sense, not a real public library, but a library open to the public.

03:28.657 --> 03:29.839
to scholars.

03:30.380 --> 03:44.983
Yes, humanistic library in which were religious work, father of the church, but classics.

03:47.186 --> 03:52.875
Latin and Greek classics.

03:53.378 --> 04:01.472
the Latin, some of the Greek classics in Latin version.

04:01.833 --> 04:05.619
But also some Greek classics in Greek.

04:07.222 --> 04:09.125
And where did they acquire these?

04:09.225 --> 04:10.588
Did they buy them?

04:10.608 --> 04:12.391
Where did they get the books?

04:12.411 --> 04:14.074
Did they buy them?

04:14.154 --> 04:18.441
No, a part was written

04:18.978 --> 04:35.457
for Nala Testa Novella in a scriptorium who was probably in the library or in the monastery in the convent.

04:35.477 --> 04:43.686
The part was a mistake was

04:47.024 --> 05:14.145
And it is still, I know if there are other people here, it is still a working library.

05:14.243 --> 05:20.329
Now, today, yes, it's a public library of the city of Cesena.

05:21.330 --> 05:22.151
That's amazing.

05:22.171 --> 05:36.807
A real public library there is only from the beginning of the 19th century, not before.

05:37.007 --> 05:39.169
That's amazing.

05:39.189 --> 05:40.791
It's a public library in the city.

05:43.454 --> 05:54.825
What is the wood on the floor?

05:54.845 --> 05:56.107
That's okay, I'm just curious.

05:58.129 --> 06:00.952
That's okay.

06:01.072 --> 06:11.402
Now they are...

06:11.737 --> 06:14.481
All things are original.

06:15.462 --> 06:22.512
The death in pine.

06:26.437 --> 06:29.181
And the readers, is this where the books were kept?

06:29.381 --> 06:29.742
Yes.

06:32.165 --> 06:34.128
And they were chained books too?

06:35.149 --> 06:38.554
No, only some...

06:38.922 --> 06:47.832
Some other books who came in the library after the construction of the library itself.

06:49.053 --> 07:02.128
But we had quite the same books which were in the 15th century.

07:03.155 --> 07:09.722
Not all the books are from 15th century.

07:09.822 --> 07:18.010
There are books older than 15th century.

07:18.030 --> 07:24.016
We have a manuscript from 9th century.

07:25.597 --> 07:32.284
What does that say?

07:32.720 --> 07:48.641
I read the name of Malacresta Mulego, who was a child of Gandolfo and nephew of Malacresta.

07:48.661 --> 07:53.608
And this was put in when the building was built?

07:53.668 --> 07:57.593
Yes, yes.

07:57.613 --> 08:01.037
And what... Yes, 1454.

08:01.057 --> 08:01.478
1454.

08:02.133 --> 08:07.942
So actually 40 years before Columbus discovered the new world.

08:07.962 --> 08:09.204
Yes, 40 years.

08:09.224 --> 08:09.685
Exactly.

08:12.029 --> 08:13.111
You had a lot of readers.

08:13.131 --> 08:15.354
These were all desks for people to read?

08:15.394 --> 08:15.474
Yes.

08:18.019 --> 08:28.275
We don't think that the Malatestiana has a library in which

08:28.576 --> 08:32.821
all desks are full of people in the 15th century.

08:32.861 --> 08:43.675
Before, we had 200 people who can't stay in the library, but... 200 places, yeah.

08:43.695 --> 08:44.737
It's not really.

08:45.257 --> 08:47.600
But there are places for 200 people.

08:48.121 --> 08:58.414
We have a library for one reader or two readers.

08:59.018 --> 09:03.903
many books for a few of readers.

09:04.784 --> 09:06.666
So the reading would be done in this room?

09:09.409 --> 09:13.954
Now... No, no, I know then, but they would read here at these desks.

09:14.434 --> 09:15.856
Where would the light come from?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.017
What kind of light?

09:17.037 --> 09:18.599
No, no, no.

09:18.619 --> 09:19.019
No light?

09:19.079 --> 09:19.820
No light.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.981
So just from the windows?

09:21.322 --> 09:21.582
Yes.

09:21.802 --> 09:22.663
No candles?

09:23.538 --> 09:30.109
My, I think, no, I think the natural light was the light.

09:30.329 --> 09:35.879
Today we haven't light in the library.

09:36.840 --> 09:41.929
And this is a, these are all seals or crests or different crests of Malatesta family.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.331
Malatesta family.

09:45.134 --> 09:46.436
Can we walk down a little?

09:46.456 --> 09:46.997
Yes.

09:49.390 --> 09:51.993
And these books are all original books that are here?

09:52.053 --> 09:56.477
Yes, from 9th to 17th century.

09:56.497 --> 10:02.083
But the big part was in the library when the library was opened.

10:06.728 --> 10:08.349
And there was one floor.

10:11.052 --> 10:14.976
Yes, I don't know exactly

10:15.226 --> 10:19.614
What is the use of the first floor?

10:21.337 --> 10:24.502
It's possible it was the scriptorium.

10:25.424 --> 10:25.985
Down below?

10:26.205 --> 10:28.429
Yes, but we don't know.

10:28.449 --> 10:29.531
What's there now?

10:30.853 --> 10:37.825
Now there is a museum, archaeological museum of Chisenta.

10:40.673 --> 11:09.398
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22,

11:09.985 --> 11:11.167
So these are study guests?

11:11.207 --> 11:15.115
Yes, yes.

11:15.155 --> 11:25.214
Now we name them P-L-U-T-E-I.

11:25.234 --> 11:31.386
And what does that mean?

11:36.732 --> 11:37.593
That's okay.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.735
But that's Italian.

11:39.815 --> 11:40.676
A sort of desk.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.499
A sort of study desk.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.203
So the books... There really wasn't room for a lot of books here, though.

11:48.744 --> 11:49.965
The books were kept under here?

11:51.206 --> 11:51.647
The books.

11:52.107 --> 11:52.568
Yes.

11:52.748 --> 11:54.250
They were kept under here?

11:56.412 --> 11:57.333
Or in original?

11:57.353 --> 11:58.334
Yes, yes, yes.

11:58.354 --> 12:00.175
The desk are the same.

12:00.836 --> 12:02.638
But this is where the books were also kept.

12:03.559 --> 12:04.139
Now?

12:04.480 --> 12:05.040
No, no, then.

12:05.261 --> 12:06.722
No, yes, yes.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.715
So how did they have, how were they catalogued?

12:09.835 --> 12:11.016
Did they have a catalog?

12:11.117 --> 12:35.359
Yes, but we not have today the original catalog, because the archive of the Malatestiana family was destroyed at the end of the Signoria Malatestiana, at the end of the 15th century.

12:37.583 --> 12:47.574
The older catalogue we have is a printed catalogue published at the end of 18th century.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.844
Are these the original windows, the glass?

12:57.385 --> 13:01.009
No.

13:10.253 --> 13:13.816
This is the crest of the family maybe?

13:14.116 --> 13:40.260
Yes, one of the crests because we have also the elephant in the door but the... How to say it in English?

13:40.679 --> 13:46.966
This is a protection for the body.

13:47.066 --> 13:47.988
A shield?

13:48.008 --> 13:48.989
A shield.

13:50.410 --> 13:55.096
Was the family noted for studying or study?

13:55.496 --> 13:57.218
Were they scholars, the family?

13:57.238 --> 13:59.541
What did the family get the wealth from?

13:59.561 --> 14:00.042
Do they know?

14:01.123 --> 14:02.625
The Malatesta family?

14:02.645 --> 14:07.190
No, the family finished in 15th century.

14:07.871 --> 14:08.492
Family scholars?

14:08.512 --> 14:09.673
Yes, yes.

14:14.699 --> 14:19.668
But why do you think they were so interested in scholarship?

14:20.169 --> 14:24.618
Do you have any idea why they founded this library?

14:26.361 --> 14:32.913
Why did the Malatestas create such a beautiful library?

14:34.115 --> 14:38.243
Imitation of other families, Medici.

14:38.543 --> 15:08.196
Did they try to imitate them also in the greatness of the books?

15:09.323 --> 15:12.866
Magnificent books?

15:12.886 --> 15:17.451
The Medician Library in Florence was... The best, yes.

15:17.791 --> 15:18.532
The greatest.

15:19.092 --> 15:24.498
And also the architecture was... Michelangelo?

15:24.778 --> 15:25.719
No, no, no.

15:25.779 --> 15:27.540
Before Michelangelo.

15:27.601 --> 15:28.301
Michelotto.

15:29.082 --> 15:38.571
The library of the Medici family was built before Michelangelo.

15:38.956 --> 15:52.108
Some years before the Malatestiana, and also in a convent, and some years before, in 1447, 1446.

15:56.792 --> 16:02.037
But it is not a library until now.

16:03.058 --> 16:08.963
So that's why this is the oldest, the one Michelangelo did, replaced the first one.

16:09.331 --> 16:11.494
How many books and manuscripts?

16:11.514 --> 16:15.198
Can you give me an idea of the numbers, the size of the library, the books?

16:16.179 --> 16:23.488
Now, 341 manuscripts and 40 printed books.

16:24.209 --> 16:24.489
In here?

16:25.130 --> 16:25.330
Yes.

16:26.712 --> 16:37.465
In original, some less, but the red part was in the library in the 15th century.

16:39.453 --> 16:44.238
And what would you say are some of the high spots, the jewels of the collection?

16:44.598 --> 16:47.701
What are some of your favorite items in here?

16:47.721 --> 16:48.322
My?

16:48.342 --> 16:49.203
Yes.

16:49.223 --> 16:54.488
My books, the manuscript books that are some of your favorites.

16:54.508 --> 16:56.130
Ah, favorite.

16:56.550 --> 17:08.582
But it's difficult to say because we have interesting manuscripts for the age.

17:08.984 --> 17:19.253
as the Isidolo di Siviglia which was of 9th century.

17:21.195 --> 17:22.436
You have a 9th century?

17:22.856 --> 17:30.143
Yes, etymologiae by Isidolo di Siviglia.

17:30.163 --> 17:36.949
But for the picture the more interesting are the

17:38.026 --> 17:49.582
Malapestian codici written and illuminated for Malapestanovello.

17:49.742 --> 17:54.509
This was built with... Is that like an eastern exposure, west?

17:56.071 --> 17:56.972
To south.

17:57.593 --> 17:58.694
South?

17:58.715 --> 17:59.616
North?

18:00.617 --> 18:02.800
So the windows are east and the west.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.345
So you get maximum sunlight coming this way.

18:17.058 --> 18:29.175
Can you show us a couple of books by chance?

18:37.808 --> 18:37.888
Yes.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.652
Are these books still called for by scholars?

18:41.729 --> 18:44.893
Do scholars come and ask and read any of these books here?

18:44.913 --> 18:45.894
No, no, no, no.

18:45.914 --> 18:50.079
The consultation is in another room.

18:50.099 --> 18:54.925
The room... But you come and get the books here, out there.

18:54.945 --> 18:57.268
They still read these books.

19:01.413 --> 19:02.374
Put my pen away.

19:06.499 --> 19:06.960
Oh, look at that.

19:10.282 --> 19:19.171
This is one of the Malatestian manuscripts, written for Malatestian novella.

19:20.193 --> 19:28.261
Exactly, there are three volumes.

19:28.421 --> 19:33.026
Life by Plutarch.

19:33.587 --> 19:34.328
Plutarch's lives.

19:34.428 --> 19:34.708
Yes.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.432
And this was done here, you think?

19:39.256 --> 19:44.122
This was done for the Meletestas here, perhaps even in this building, you think?

19:44.182 --> 19:44.883
Yes, yes.

19:45.824 --> 19:47.386
They hired the illuminators too?

19:47.406 --> 19:47.586
Yes.

19:49.228 --> 19:57.177
Some life was illuminated with portraits of the people.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.401
Is that dated?

20:00.421 --> 20:01.602
Do you know the date on this?

20:02.223 --> 20:04.325
Do you know the date, the year on this?

20:04.365 --> 20:08.250
The date, not exactly, but...

20:08.585 --> 20:15.338
Perhaps 40, 48, 47, 48.

20:16.972 --> 20:20.477
Your condition looks wonderful, the condition of the book.

20:21.038 --> 20:40.927
Not exactly, but the condition was the same, are the same from the beginning of the library and then there is the adaptation of books and the condition.

20:40.947 --> 20:46.135
There is a lot of wet in the room.

20:47.363 --> 20:53.113
in the winter, but also in the other seasons.

20:53.133 --> 20:57.862
So, you don't have any environmental controls in here for these books?

20:59.305 --> 21:00.627
Yes, instruments.

21:00.807 --> 21:01.288
Are they?

21:01.308 --> 21:01.829
Oh, yes.

21:01.849 --> 21:10.485
No, but we have... We name them thermo-hygrometry, thermo-hydrography.

21:11.562 --> 21:17.410
instruments to control temperature and humidity.

21:17.851 --> 21:19.153
And you have them in here.

21:20.114 --> 21:22.678
So there are instruments?

21:22.698 --> 21:23.679
On some desks.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.040
Oh good.

21:29.648 --> 21:35.817
This is a wonderful portrait of Johnny Caesar.

21:35.837 --> 21:39.983
Oh that is pretty good.

21:40.925 --> 21:51.138
And the life was translated by Guarino Veronese from Greek of Plutarch.

21:51.158 --> 21:52.040
That is beautiful.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.124
That must be beautiful.

21:55.144 --> 21:57.807
And it's influenced by Pisanello.

21:59.950 --> 22:03.194
The art now you're talking about.

22:03.214 --> 22:05.397
And that's Lapis, that must be Lapis.

22:05.714 --> 22:09.419
the blue leprisizer?

22:09.439 --> 22:23.295
Not as color as the other, mineral, but I don't know from which kind of mineral.

22:23.315 --> 22:26.679
It's a beautiful calligraphy.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.241
Humanistic.

22:32.827 --> 22:35.350
And this is in three volumes, you said, right?

22:36.038 --> 22:44.690
And this is... It's beautiful.

22:44.710 --> 22:45.851
This is the life of Caesar.

22:45.992 --> 22:46.292
Yes.

22:47.734 --> 22:56.246
And now we have other life and other portraits, Arthasert.

22:57.808 --> 22:58.509
Who is that?

22:59.069 --> 23:00.291
Arthasert.

23:07.713 --> 23:13.159
King of the first time.

23:14.340 --> 23:30.418
Oh, Jepsi, that's who that is.

23:30.438 --> 23:30.799
Beautiful.

23:33.422 --> 23:36.505
Yeah.

23:40.484 --> 23:49.976
I wonder how long something like this took to make?

23:49.996 --> 23:55.063
A lot of time.

23:57.145 --> 24:00.970
Two or four sheets in a day.

24:03.133 --> 24:03.453
Feet?

24:05.096 --> 24:06.998
Two or four sheets.

24:07.248 --> 24:09.332
sheet in a day.

24:10.454 --> 24:28.429
And then to make a manuscript of 400 pages, 100 or 200 days were to written, only to written, but this

24:28.932 --> 24:38.360
Patchman was prepared before and then the artist... And then they would leave space for the illuminations.

24:39.081 --> 24:42.143
And they also worked in several colors as well.

24:45.026 --> 24:45.846
It's magnificent.

24:47.088 --> 24:53.833
So they hired their own... The scriptorium was down in the basement, that's correct.

24:53.933 --> 24:54.914
Maybe it was.

24:54.934 --> 24:58.197
All the Patchman was from younger...

24:59.425 --> 25:07.516
Look at Socrates.

25:08.578 --> 25:13.745
He was like a Franciscan.

25:14.186 --> 25:19.713
He looks like a Franciscan monk, right?

25:19.733 --> 25:19.934
Yes.

25:21.215 --> 25:21.916
Oh, that's great.

25:21.977 --> 25:28.065
But the library was in a Franciscan convent and then it's normal.

25:31.370 --> 25:35.835
But that is very good evidence that it was done by people here, too.

25:36.235 --> 25:46.046
If you're looking for evidence that it was done here, that's very good internal evidence.

25:46.066 --> 25:46.807
He's got a beard.

25:46.967 --> 25:53.454
He's got a skull cap and a cloak.

25:53.474 --> 25:57.718
Socrates, that's great.

25:57.738 --> 25:57.838
Okay.

25:57.859 --> 25:58.339
It's beautiful.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.482
Is it all one hand, do you think?

26:01.802 --> 26:03.284
Is it all one hand?

26:03.304 --> 26:04.105
This book, yes.

26:04.585 --> 26:04.926
Really?

26:05.246 --> 26:05.847
Only one hand.

26:05.887 --> 26:09.911
And I think it's Jacopo della Pergola.

26:12.734 --> 26:15.457
Could you spell his name?

26:15.477 --> 26:23.826
Who didn't see this book, but we know his calligraphy.

26:24.587 --> 26:26.729
Could you spell his name?

26:27.089 --> 26:27.870
Jacopo.

26:28.222 --> 26:29.784
J-A-C-O-P-O?

26:29.985 --> 26:39.458
Yes, from Pergola, which is a little town near Ancona.

26:39.879 --> 26:42.643
P-E-R-G-A?

26:44.125 --> 26:48.311
P-E-R-G-O-L-A.

26:50.154 --> 26:52.357
Is he a famous calligrapher?

26:54.781 --> 26:57.064
For Malatestian books.

27:04.553 --> 27:07.757
We don't know who the artists are, of course.

27:07.817 --> 27:09.118
We don't know.

27:09.138 --> 27:11.101
Do we know who the artists are?

27:11.181 --> 27:11.862
No.

27:12.042 --> 27:19.851
No, it's more difficult to know the artists like the copyists.

27:21.993 --> 27:29.422
Because sometimes copyists sing their work but not the artists.

27:29.442 --> 27:33.767
When a reader came here and he read, was he able to take notes?

27:34.557 --> 27:35.498
Do you think they took notes?

27:36.058 --> 27:36.699
It's possible.

27:37.560 --> 27:55.295
In the 15th century, the habit to read and read them contemporary was beginning.

27:57.237 --> 27:58.438
So there is sufficient light.

27:58.478 --> 28:02.742
You can see the windows are aligned

28:04.865 --> 28:23.194
When you're sitting down the light is good, better than standing up, so the light... Some buildings were not in 15th century in that area.

28:23.647 --> 28:30.775
In fact, we have less light than in the other.

28:31.957 --> 28:33.499
You'd call this leaded glass?

28:33.599 --> 28:38.124
I wonder if the glass is fabricated originally?

28:38.204 --> 28:49.317
We don't know which kind, because the first representation of the library is in the

28:49.668 --> 28:58.059
engrave the plates which are in the printed catalogue in 18th century.

28:58.079 --> 29:02.225
1775, 1776.

29:02.345 --> 29:06.110
So 200 years afterwards.

29:07.271 --> 29:10.495
That's the first representation that comes to today.

29:11.857 --> 29:11.997
Yes.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.781
We haven't before 18th century.

29:19.317 --> 29:22.121
And I imagine when the sun is out, the light is much better, too.

29:22.141 --> 29:23.062
Yes, it is wonderful.

29:27.288 --> 29:27.949
That was wonderful.

29:27.969 --> 29:28.349
Thank you.

29:31.373 --> 29:31.654
Yes.

29:34.818 --> 29:38.323
The condition here, I have to say, we were up at Durham Cathedral.

29:38.343 --> 29:44.211
We were at Durham Cathedral in England a few days ago and at Hereford.

29:44.393 --> 29:45.995
Your condition is much better.

29:47.397 --> 29:54.507
Because perhaps the conditions in Italy are better than in England.

29:54.527 --> 29:57.991
I just want to count the number of windows.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.234
But it's a bit wet.

30:10.088 --> 30:11.009
The humidity.

30:11.229 --> 30:13.152
I'm just counting the windows.

30:13.486 --> 30:25.217
What would you call the architecture?

30:30.002 --> 30:38.030
From Renaissance but with the influence of Gothic.

30:38.090 --> 30:40.152
And what is this material here?

30:40.402 --> 30:57.577
Not a model.

30:57.597 --> 31:00.079
That's okay.

31:00.599 --> 31:02.241
That's fine.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.883
And this is the walls.

31:06.224 --> 31:09.767
The color.

31:10.456 --> 31:16.286
The material is... I think it was painted.

31:16.326 --> 31:18.310
I think it was painted blue.

31:18.410 --> 31:28.127
The color is the original color, which was replaced...

31:28.327 --> 31:51.803
In 1926, after a restoration, who take off the white picture which was posed before and we really don't know when.

31:56.609 --> 32:11.169
And the Michelotto Library in Florence in this period had the same call.

32:12.712 --> 32:21.604
Recently we are here two scholar

32:21.989 --> 32:37.416
from Florence's superintendent who studied the original color of the library of Cosimo de' Medici.

32:38.358 --> 32:45.887
They saw that the color is quite the same on the Malapestiano.

32:46.989 --> 32:54.759
The same kind of green color on the Malapestiano.

32:54.779 --> 32:59.024
Could you show us another book on this side, just so I can feel the light coming from the other side?

32:59.064 --> 32:59.925
Would that be possible?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.349
Could you show us another book?

33:04.751 --> 33:06.373
On this area, yes.

33:16.360 --> 33:37.251
Classic in what respect, Doctor?

33:37.872 --> 33:43.060
Classic for the ornaments.

33:45.824 --> 33:49.710
Look at this little animal.

33:56.840 --> 34:00.625
These are the initial of the name of Malatesta Novella.

34:01.987 --> 34:07.155
So this is done for him.

34:07.215 --> 34:10.920
And that ornament here is Malatesta Novella.

34:15.912 --> 34:22.081
What is this book, the subject of this book?

34:22.101 --> 34:26.226
Look at that, beautiful.

34:26.246 --> 34:30.332
I think it's the Sermon of the Sermon Ambrosius.

34:30.412 --> 34:31.494
Sermon Ambrosius.

34:31.995 --> 34:32.255
Yes.

34:34.458 --> 34:37.662
Is Sermon Ambrosius the person for whom you named the Ambrosiana?

34:37.883 --> 34:38.764
Yes.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.472
How is he relevant to Milan?

34:44.913 --> 34:48.301
Yes, he's the protector of Milan.

34:49.665 --> 34:59.368
The first bishop, perhaps, or one of the first bishops of Milan in 4th century.

35:02.572 --> 35:07.938
When printed books started to come in, this library... Was built.

35:07.958 --> 35:16.366
Yes, in the same year in which Gutenberg printed the 42 lines.

35:17.608 --> 35:18.649
Same year, 1450.

35:18.689 --> 35:19.209
Yes.

35:19.389 --> 35:26.096
And so then, a few years later, Parnatz, they go to Subiaco, they bring the press in.

35:26.116 --> 35:26.857
Yes, before.

35:27.198 --> 35:29.140
Subiaco was in 1465.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.443
So within 15 years, there were printed books.

35:32.575 --> 35:34.558
What was the attitude here?

35:34.938 --> 35:56.389
Do you think that they opposed printed books or do you think... No, because the Malatestiana, the Malatestiana family, finished when, exactly the year in which Schweineheim e Panos print, in 1465.

35:57.610 --> 36:01.536
November 20, 1465.

36:01.752 --> 36:03.094
Malapesta Novello died.

36:03.115 --> 36:09.246
And contemporary Schweinheim and Panels printed their books on Subyacna.

36:09.266 --> 36:09.787
He was the last one?

36:09.807 --> 36:10.889
He was the last one at least then?

36:10.909 --> 36:12.612
Yes.

36:12.632 --> 36:15.718
And so then were there any books added after that?

36:15.798 --> 36:23.733
Some books but issued by the common by the Franciscans.

36:23.753 --> 36:24.334
So who

36:24.955 --> 36:28.319
Who took over the library after the death of Malatesta?

36:28.860 --> 36:54.490
The convent and the city, the town, because Malatesta Novello decided that the library was administrated by the convent and by the municipality.

36:57.355 --> 37:03.130
Do you have a sense of why this has survived to be the oldest and so many others didn't?

37:04.714 --> 37:08.223
How did it happen that this is now the oldest library?

37:08.925 --> 37:13.457
Because it is in a little town.

37:13.893 --> 37:34.956
outside of some events like war because Cesena

37:35.206 --> 38:03.964
returned in the pontifical state, in the state of church, and remained under the Pope until 1861, until the rise of the Italian state.

38:05.969 --> 38:15.106
So there was very little, I don't want to use the word violence, but there was no conflict here.

38:15.186 --> 38:27.910
Fortunately not, but some conflict between the convent and the city

38:28.953 --> 38:42.266
they were sometimes, but they not make some damage in the library.

38:43.087 --> 38:43.588
Great story.

38:44.369 --> 38:48.793
It opens the year, the Gutenberg invents type.

38:48.813 --> 38:48.993
Yes, yes.

38:49.013 --> 38:54.679
They acquire manuscripts and then for 15 years, and what were the dates again?

38:54.699 --> 38:55.540
You said November?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.762
Yeah, November 20.

38:58.619 --> 39:00.361
Manataste 1465.

39:00.401 --> 39:01.282
Manataste dies.

39:03.305 --> 39:06.188
So that's the same year.

39:08.911 --> 39:10.753
But the press is set up as subiaco.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.375
Yes.

39:12.676 --> 39:18.002
In November, Svani and Japan, where, where, yes.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.425
That's wonderful.

39:22.075 --> 39:23.837
It's great, it's perfect.

39:23.977 --> 39:32.687
I think perhaps Malatesta Novello never, never saw, didn't see a printed book.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.229
It's possible.

39:36.451 --> 39:38.934
I wonder if he even knew what it was, you know.

39:38.954 --> 39:44.100
Because in Italy we say that only

39:44.705 --> 39:55.081
Bessarion and Nikolaus of Kuz, no new printed books.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.964
Say that again.

39:56.984 --> 39:58.467
Would you say that again?

39:58.487 --> 39:59.568
We say only Kuz?

40:01.632 --> 40:02.313
Bessarion.

40:03.094 --> 40:08.923
P-E-S-S-S-A-R

40:09.258 --> 40:11.641
I-O-M.

40:11.661 --> 40:12.282
Bessire.

40:12.383 --> 40:18.531
Bessire and Nicholas of Cousa.

40:19.974 --> 40:20.715
Cousa.

40:22.417 --> 40:26.022
C-U-S-A.

40:26.443 --> 40:31.690
And who were they?

40:31.791 --> 40:33.914
Two cardinals.

40:34.875 --> 40:35.616
Oh, cardinals.

40:36.257 --> 40:38.961
Bessire is the Greek cardinal.

40:39.498 --> 40:48.750
We took a great library, a great Greek library in Italy.

40:50.572 --> 40:55.218
A part of it was now in the Marciano Library in Venice.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.181
Which we're going to Monday.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.744
He took the Greek library from where?

40:59.784 --> 41:00.606
Constantinople?

41:00.826 --> 41:05.952
Yes, from Trebizond.

41:05.973 --> 41:07.014
Trebizond.

41:07.094 --> 41:09.437
Trebizond.

41:10.058 --> 41:17.506
Now in Turkey, but... So when the Muslims were taking over, he fled with the books.

41:19.088 --> 41:32.262
In Venice, certainly, surely you will see... We went there yesterday.

41:32.843 --> 41:38.749
A great imprint of Bessariam.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.862
Is that Marciano?

41:41.123 --> 41:41.403
Yes.

41:41.744 --> 41:58.007
He brought, he invited them.

41:58.247 --> 42:03.194
It's possible, it's possible.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.859
But he was Greek.

42:06.879 --> 42:08.922
Yes.

42:09.391 --> 42:12.196
of heritage and merit.

42:12.316 --> 42:14.059
Our background is Greek-American.

42:15.041 --> 42:18.346
Ah!

42:18.366 --> 42:21.111
We have some Greek manuscripts.

42:21.131 --> 42:21.352
Really?

42:21.572 --> 42:25.278
Yes, 14 Greek manuscripts.

42:25.298 --> 42:26.701
And how do you suppose you get them?

42:29.546 --> 42:33.913
Both directly by Malatesta Novella.

42:35.243 --> 43:03.259
but not copied because in italy few people know the greek characters but i wonder why he bought it if very few people could read it i wonder who he bought it when i wonder who he bought those greek manuscripts why he bought them because some people can read

43:03.593 --> 43:17.394
The library was not only for Malatetta Novello and his family, but for scholars and humanistic people.

43:19.317 --> 43:25.386
Can you think of the names of any great scholars through history who have come here to study?

43:27.649 --> 43:28.791
Paolo Manuzio.

43:31.184 --> 43:44.763
from Biondo Flavio, F-M-A-D-I-A.

43:45.363 --> 43:53.154
Oh, Pietro Ben, if possible.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.364
And Piraccio Lupezia Borgia.

44:05.103 --> 44:09.449
Are there any great universities nearby here?

44:09.829 --> 44:10.670
In the 15th century?

44:11.111 --> 44:11.411
Yes.

44:11.551 --> 44:13.874
No, no.

44:14.876 --> 44:24.008
There was a studium in the convent, a little scoot, but not a university or not.

44:24.028 --> 44:30.456
See, so many great, like the Capitulario in Verona had the cathedral there next door.

44:30.476 --> 44:34.401
There's always a reason why a library... This one is a family.

44:35.140 --> 44:40.027
There's not a university, there's not a church, there's just one family.

44:40.047 --> 44:46.617
That's the reason why this library was established, I think.

44:47.078 --> 44:59.897
To, as I said, to emulate other family in Italian Renaissance.

44:59.917 --> 45:03.763
But also because Maladesca Novello,

45:03.963 --> 45:29.802
whose family was warriors was not loved not were but studies literature intellectuals yes they were they were not intellectuals yes but his family no

45:31.840 --> 45:40.276
father, grandfather, brother, were warriors, were involved in war.

45:40.296 --> 45:42.400
And he had no heirs, he had no sons?

45:43.582 --> 45:45.506
When he died, you said the family died out?

45:45.687 --> 45:48.512
No, no, no, without sons.

45:48.532 --> 45:49.854
So that was the end of the line?

45:50.055 --> 45:52.560
Yes.

45:52.580 --> 45:54.844
It'd be a pretty interesting one with Czechoslovak, wouldn't it?

45:57.372 --> 46:00.656
Do they have anything written on him?

46:00.676 --> 46:01.897
Do they write any books?

46:01.917 --> 46:04.860
Could we get some material on him that would help me?

46:05.181 --> 46:06.923
Yes, yes.

46:07.704 --> 46:15.993
We have a postcard of the library and of books.

46:17.735 --> 46:24.763
A little guide about the library and two posters.

46:25.790 --> 46:39.348
and a reproduction on a special kind of paper of this portrait of St.

46:40.490 --> 46:42.753
Augustine.

46:44.355 --> 46:45.337
St.

46:47.079 --> 46:47.760
Augustine.

46:49.202 --> 46:53.788
We have a reproduction of this.

46:55.979 --> 46:58.863
That is St.

46:58.923 --> 46:59.464
Augustine.

47:01.046 --> 47:02.208
And what is the name?

47:02.248 --> 47:06.895
Francisca Monge.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.102
And this is a classic malefist.

47:12.122 --> 47:14.005
Yes, malefist.

47:14.980 --> 47:33.782
Italian Renaissance manuscript, because this, how to say, the fact which is around the portrait, the picture, we named it

47:33.762 --> 47:36.566
Cornice a bianchi girari.

47:36.766 --> 47:41.293
Cornice a bianchi girari.

47:41.433 --> 47:51.467
Cornice a bianchi girari.

47:51.447 --> 47:52.728
The design.

47:52.828 --> 47:53.589
Yes.

47:54.090 --> 47:54.510
Great.

47:54.951 --> 47:56.452
Very lovely.

47:56.592 --> 48:07.804
In Italian, the word girare is going around.

48:07.844 --> 48:09.125
So how do you spell it?

48:09.466 --> 48:10.747
Girari.

48:11.127 --> 48:12.649
Girari.

48:13.149 --> 48:13.770
G-E-R.

48:14.871 --> 48:18.114
R-A-R-I.

48:19.276 --> 48:19.776
Girari.

48:20.016 --> 48:20.577
Yes.

48:20.860 --> 48:21.681
go around.

48:23.103 --> 48:23.664
That's lovely.

48:24.706 --> 48:26.949
And what is this little decoration here?

48:27.330 --> 48:28.171
Codivine.

48:28.812 --> 48:32.578
That's Saint Augustine, looking up to heaven, to God.

48:33.279 --> 48:36.163
Look at the Christ, the maple.

48:36.183 --> 48:37.645
Oh, the Christ.

48:41.110 --> 48:48.201
To give the perspectives and... That's so much of it.

48:48.974 --> 48:58.070
Do you have a little history of the library and of the Malatesta that we could purchase that would tell us, give us some background about him, some information?

48:58.491 --> 49:04.441
Taking from which... A bookstore.

49:04.802 --> 49:09.671
A book, something, yeah, that would give me some... We could buy a book.

49:10.452 --> 49:13.277
A biography or something, or something written about...

49:13.645 --> 49:24.336
Some information you will find in the little guide I noticed before.

49:25.978 --> 49:41.273
There are other books but actually unfortunately they are not in

49:41.253 --> 49:59.392
I'm not for buying now because the edition has finished.

49:59.452 --> 50:02.995
There are no examples in circulation now.

50:03.336 --> 50:07.060
That's wonderful.

50:08.221 --> 50:10.483
That's beautiful.

50:12.691 --> 50:17.338
The letters here.

50:17.438 --> 50:24.989
What does this say coming down here, Linda?

50:25.630 --> 50:27.352
The letters.

50:35.084 --> 50:39.590
Quo di modo?

50:39.610 --> 50:40.251
Audio in line.

50:42.644 --> 50:53.117
Do you have an idea of when this was done, this also in the 1400s?

50:54.378 --> 50:58.463
Yes, yes.

50:58.483 --> 50:59.584
That's magnificent.

51:00.926 --> 51:01.206
Yes.

51:01.927 --> 51:11.098
We had the name of the artist who was the French man, Jean de Finale.

51:11.804 --> 51:14.828
Jean de Pinal.

51:16.610 --> 51:26.502
And what are those initials there?

51:28.003 --> 51:31.067
Yes, Epinal is a little town.

51:32.789 --> 51:35.332
So in French it is Jean?

51:35.352 --> 51:36.414
Jean de Pinal.

51:37.295 --> 51:39.938
Here in A.L.

51:39.958 --> 51:40.038
Yes.

51:40.919 --> 51:41.760
It is the part, yes.

51:42.297 --> 51:43.319
Does he have a year there?

51:43.660 --> 51:48.148
No, unfortunately not.

51:48.329 --> 51:53.078
No, there are 125 sermons by St.

51:53.098 --> 51:56.024
Augustine.

51:56.044 --> 52:03.799
But there isn't a year.

52:04.977 --> 52:16.059
between 1447 and 1465, when Maragel Fonagaro died.

52:16.079 --> 52:18.243
So you think this was done in France or here?

52:18.884 --> 52:20.447
No, no, here.

52:20.487 --> 52:22.952
He lived here.

52:22.972 --> 52:27.120
He married a woman from Cesena.

52:27.758 --> 52:32.425
So you know about his life then?

52:32.445 --> 52:37.634
From Arcade, nothing like that.

52:37.654 --> 52:45.306
Ioannis, Antoni, Vespino.

52:48.190 --> 52:49.693
And it says Deo gratias.

52:51.495 --> 52:53.158
What does that mean, Deo gratias?

52:54.488 --> 53:16.380
We say thank you to our Lord.

53:17.883 --> 53:18.564
Thank God.

53:19.265 --> 53:20.226
Thank God.

53:26.922 --> 53:29.686
That's great.

53:29.886 --> 53:37.816
They had a commentary by Sant'Agostino in Gospel of St.

53:37.856 --> 53:40.619
John.

53:40.639 --> 53:48.930
Doctor, when I come to write about this, can I email you or fax you some of the material so you can check it to see if I have it right?

53:49.291 --> 53:50.893
Yes.

53:50.933 --> 53:53.496
Some of these spellings and some of these dates.

53:54.177 --> 53:56.760
That way you can read it and check it and make sure it's right too.

53:57.652 --> 53:59.654
I'd like to do that, if you don't mind.

54:01.917 --> 54:02.678
It'll be a while.

54:02.698 --> 54:08.805
In other words, when I've written about this library, I'll send it to you.

54:08.925 --> 54:09.706
Yes.

54:09.726 --> 54:21.220
I remain in Chisena only too long, because I go to another direction of the library in Rome.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.102
Do you know where you wrote it?

54:23.572 --> 54:26.997
Can you tell me where you're going so we can stay in touch?

54:27.278 --> 54:28.099
By email?

54:28.239 --> 54:29.801
Yes.

54:29.821 --> 54:31.103
Okay.

54:31.123 --> 54:34.268
I'll send you an email when I get back and remind you.

54:34.729 --> 54:36.371
Okay.

54:36.391 --> 54:38.955
So you're going to Loma?

54:39.115 --> 54:42.581
I came from Loma.

54:44.243 --> 54:45.325
How long have you been here?

54:46.186 --> 54:47.869
Eight years.

54:48.990 --> 54:52.836
So this whole library existed for just 241 manuscripts.

54:54.638 --> 54:56.442
You said there were 241... 341.

54:56.462 --> 54:58.226
341.

54:58.266 --> 55:02.796
This whole library was built just for 341 manuscripts.

55:02.837 --> 55:06.665
That tells you how precious the books were, right?

55:06.806 --> 55:08.730
Yes.

55:08.750 --> 55:10.133
A lot of them.

55:10.754 --> 55:11.735
Was that enough?

55:11.795 --> 55:14.679
Was that about white in those days?

55:14.699 --> 55:19.585
Was that a great library 500 years ago?

55:19.886 --> 55:29.298
No, not exactly a great library, but a medium library.

55:29.318 --> 55:33.724
Sure for the quality.

55:33.744 --> 55:35.806
That's great.

55:35.826 --> 55:36.407
That's wonderful.

55:39.948 --> 55:48.320
How many people come to see this?

55:49.361 --> 55:50.563
Seven thousand million a year.

55:50.583 --> 55:55.950
Seven thousand people a year.

55:55.971 --> 56:00.076
That's a lot.

56:00.096 --> 56:00.857
Nice choice.

56:00.877 --> 56:05.744
And when this was built, there were no other buildings, this was the only building right here?

56:05.764 --> 56:08.148
No, the Franciscan complex was the only one.

56:08.648 --> 56:09.870
Oh, look at this.

56:11.825 --> 56:12.875
I understand.
