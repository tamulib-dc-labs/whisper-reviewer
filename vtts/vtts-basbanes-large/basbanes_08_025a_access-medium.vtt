WEBVTT

00:02.765 --> 00:03.926
To Stephen Ambrose.

00:06.910 --> 00:10.394
Anyway, that wall changes with every book.

00:11.796 --> 00:16.521
Two years ago, it was a big, huge, enormous map of detail.

00:16.541 --> 00:24.390
Of the beaches that I used a lot, actually, because so darn many French villages involved.

00:24.410 --> 00:29.396
And before that, the hell was all of this.

00:29.416 --> 00:30.898
Oh, I had all Dick Nixon up there.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.145
I had a Nixon poster.

00:35.667 --> 00:39.693
Nixon's the one.

00:41.135 --> 00:44.800
It's a wonderful Nixon poster.

00:44.860 --> 00:46.182
68 or 72?

00:46.202 --> 00:49.107
68.

00:50.629 --> 00:54.074
And before that, it was all Eisenhower.

00:54.094 --> 01:01.645
And now I've got to change it back to World War II, because that's what I'm working on now.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.536
Why is that?

01:02.836 --> 01:08.101
Do you need these little icons, so to speak, when you're working?

01:08.121 --> 01:12.805
Can I give you a little bit of ambiance for what you're working on?

01:13.866 --> 01:14.327
Just nice.

01:14.727 --> 01:15.408
Nice.

01:15.428 --> 01:16.348
When your eyes come up?

01:17.990 --> 01:20.092
I don't know how often it registers continuously.

01:20.632 --> 01:23.935
If it's a map of D-Day up there, I'm just using it all the time.

01:24.516 --> 01:25.457
Really, it was such a big map.

01:25.517 --> 01:29.961
It was about the only place I could put it.

01:30.802 --> 01:47.502
But this, over here, the Charlie Russell of Lewis and Clark meeting the flatheads, and then these two Missouri River pictures and the Lewis and Clark statues always stand.

01:47.522 --> 01:47.943
Of course.

01:48.143 --> 01:53.469
I'm sure the rifle is... The rifle's always up there.

01:53.589 --> 01:54.210
Is that a...

01:54.967 --> 01:56.208
Kentucky rifle?

01:56.268 --> 01:58.010
Yes, that's a Kentucky rifle.

01:58.030 --> 02:03.636
But you say that it really technically is not a Kentucky rifle, it's something else.

02:03.716 --> 02:05.158
Yeah, it's a Virginia.

02:05.378 --> 02:08.081
It's a Pennsylvania rifle.

02:09.723 --> 02:13.687
So a good man could reload in about 30 seconds, I think you say.

02:14.228 --> 02:15.389
Yeah, yeah.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.594
Depending on the adrenaline level.

02:21.415 --> 02:22.917
So, I'm sorry.

02:22.937 --> 02:23.117
Go ahead.

02:23.485 --> 02:24.827
No, go ahead.

02:24.887 --> 02:31.238
All these photographs around are from the trips over the years all west that we took with the kids.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.923
So these all go back 15 or 20 years.

02:35.064 --> 02:38.350
But there are various scenes from everywhere along those.

02:40.013 --> 02:42.938
These are pictures you shot and the family shot.

02:43.619 --> 02:49.729
Maybe you could just describe a few of the places and the pictures that, you know, on this exterior wall here.

02:52.055 --> 03:05.873
The one in the middle with that signpost three forks with me, that's at the three forks of the... What becomes at that point, right behind where I'm standing, becomes the Missouri River.

03:05.893 --> 03:16.948
And the three rivers flowing in, you can see in that picture on the left up there, top, those are us in the canoes there.

03:18.262 --> 03:24.689
And this is right where the rivers come together to form the Missouri River.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.072
It's a gorgeous photograph.

03:27.773 --> 03:28.053
Yeah.

03:28.073 --> 03:32.198
Somebody took that, in your party, laid back and took that picture?

03:32.458 --> 03:44.692
No, we had run into a professional photographer, very well-known, McDuff Everton, who was on a shoot for one of the glossy travel magazines, doing Lewis and Clark, and we ran into them.

03:44.712 --> 03:46.294
And so we spent a couple of days together.

03:47.877 --> 03:49.980
And I told him stories, and he took pictures.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.970
I thought he was a very fair swap, you know, because he sent me some of the best of it.

03:55.990 --> 03:56.811
That's nice.

03:56.831 --> 03:56.992
Yeah.

03:57.993 --> 03:58.755
Darn right.

04:00.938 --> 04:04.384
So this is... In that upper left corner, those are pictures I took.

04:04.464 --> 04:11.094
Those are in the White Cliffs of the Missouri River, which is the part of the whole thing that we love the most and have done the most.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.201
And that's a 165-mile stretch of river

04:17.155 --> 04:24.545
with no bridges, no power lines, and no anything.

04:24.565 --> 04:29.171
So, the most remote part of the lower 48, really.

04:30.633 --> 04:31.354
Wow.

04:31.374 --> 04:34.558
So, it's still a lot like... Still is.

04:34.578 --> 04:44.852
And very much the same condition that it might have been when... All is the same, except the Buffalo area.

04:44.892 --> 04:46.234
The Buffalo might come back then.

04:47.648 --> 04:51.532
It's being talked about some, and some little steps are being made.

04:52.153 --> 04:55.776
Well, all those prairie grass, they didn't work good for cattle.

04:55.796 --> 05:00.081
They need a lot richer feed than that, and those buffalo are, they get fat on that stuff.

05:01.262 --> 05:13.034
They're the natural beast for the... So there's buffalo breeding that's going on, and some buffalo are running a bit wilder, and this is ideal country to turn it back to the buffalo.

05:14.555 --> 05:17.318
It's perfect for it, because as you say, it's still a little bit.

05:17.551 --> 05:21.195
Yeah, it's one person every 100 square miles or something.

05:21.395 --> 05:22.356
So what are these ranchers?

05:22.416 --> 05:24.739
Are there any ranchers out there that would protest?

05:24.759 --> 05:25.079
Sure.

05:25.099 --> 05:27.982
They're the ones that of course don't want that, right?

05:28.002 --> 05:28.843
Yeah.

05:28.863 --> 05:29.184
Yeah.

05:29.864 --> 05:30.605
This will be a fight.

05:34.670 --> 05:46.883
Very early in the book, you said, I guess you were out there with your family in 1975, and you thought that this would be a way to observe the bicentennial, would be to more or less retrace

05:47.572 --> 05:55.363
prior to the Lewis and Clark expedition, and that prior to that you'd never read the journals, I guess.

05:55.844 --> 05:56.384
That's right.

05:56.545 --> 05:57.226
That's right.

05:57.246 --> 06:11.285
I was embarrassed by that, because I had a PhD from the University of Wisconsin, which had the best history of poverty in the country, and we thought the most rarest.

06:11.305 --> 06:15.992
And I was certified by then to be capable of going into the College of Teaching American Survey history.

06:18.217 --> 06:21.402
And I never read Losin Clark.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.403
I don't know really why.

06:22.423 --> 06:30.114
I just, I never had a specific course on that, what they called in those days the Jacksonian period.

06:30.134 --> 06:32.197
Or the Jeffersonian Jackson period.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.479
Anyway, I had never read the journal.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.404
How did you feel when you read them?

06:37.424 --> 06:40.789
You said, wow, I gotta go.

06:40.829 --> 06:42.512
I just gotta go.

06:42.752 --> 06:44.214
We began planning immediately.

06:45.416 --> 06:47.599
And it was a very exciting spring.

06:48.305 --> 06:49.186
getting out the L.L.

06:49.226 --> 06:50.047
Bean catalog.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.108
We were on a very tight budget.

06:52.128 --> 06:55.151
I was an assistant professor, I guess.

06:55.171 --> 06:57.973
Were you basically outdoor kinds of people?

06:58.254 --> 07:01.497
Not really, no.

07:02.277 --> 07:06.341
So this was really paying tribute to the expedition?

07:06.741 --> 07:07.001
Yeah.

07:08.403 --> 07:14.208
Well, we had been camping out on the Crazy Horse and Custer Buck, but nowhere near like one.

07:14.228 --> 07:16.109
We did on this one.

07:16.149 --> 07:17.991
That was all car camp.

07:18.393 --> 07:23.120
Well, I like the fact that you took some of your students along that day.

07:23.280 --> 07:23.681
Just 25 of them.

07:24.141 --> 07:24.782
Yeah.

07:24.802 --> 07:25.343
25 or so.

07:25.443 --> 07:29.549
The first year, and then the scattered groups, never that many again.

07:29.569 --> 07:33.996
In later years, smaller groups.

07:34.016 --> 07:35.077
Yeah, they had a great time.

07:35.838 --> 07:36.660
So were we.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.341
Fun being learned.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.884
Especially on that 4th of July.

07:40.225 --> 07:45.753
Let my past, because they're on the upper right.

07:45.773 --> 07:47.235
At what point did you decide that a book

07:48.532 --> 07:56.859
Would you like to do a book on that?

07:56.879 --> 07:57.420
Immediately.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.342
Okay, immediately.

08:00.362 --> 08:02.044
But that's habitual with me.

08:03.965 --> 08:06.647
I get subjects by getting a curiosity.

08:08.149 --> 08:15.035
And once I got that curiosity, the only way to satisfy is to write my own book, because I never find what satisfies the curiosity.

08:16.596 --> 08:17.897
It's been the case of

08:18.130 --> 08:21.815
all of my biographies and other work, too.

08:22.976 --> 08:27.942
So, anyway, I immediately decided I was going to put a lot of time on this Lewis and Clark experience.

08:27.962 --> 08:28.803
I wanted to know more.

08:29.124 --> 08:33.069
I wanted to read the surrounding literature now that I've written.

08:33.089 --> 08:34.010
That's what I do for a living.

08:34.090 --> 08:37.555
I can't afford to put in that kind of time if I'm not going to be getting a return on it.

08:38.856 --> 08:40.979
And that's both financially and emotionally.

08:43.162 --> 08:45.825
So, naturally, it was going to be a bar.

08:46.582 --> 08:54.770
Initially, it was going to be a travel log of the family on the Lewis and Clark Trail.

08:55.311 --> 08:56.932
It was going to be a very personal book.

08:56.952 --> 08:58.033
Yeah.

08:58.053 --> 09:11.446
And boy, I really wasn't very high up on the advance ladder at that time, I remember, because I talked Doubleday, my then publisher, into giving us a $2,000 advance, without which we couldn't have even started out.

09:11.466 --> 09:15.070
And I promised that all the kids would keep journals.

09:16.231 --> 09:22.021
And Maura and I would keep journals, and then we'd blend and see what happened.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.004
So you did get an advance for such a book.

09:24.024 --> 09:24.946
$2,000.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.891
But you had to be signed a contract, right?

09:28.091 --> 09:28.292
Mm-hmm.

09:28.312 --> 09:29.634
And is this back in the 70s?

09:30.395 --> 09:30.556
Mm-hmm.

09:32.719 --> 09:37.087
And, yeah, it was before we even left.

09:39.591 --> 09:41.935
It was necessary to finance the trip.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.562
Well, I mean, it's not that anybody didn't cry.

09:46.602 --> 09:50.026
We all wrote, but it didn't really work very well.

09:50.807 --> 09:54.411
And I don't know what kind of a mood I was in or if it was just the kind of writing that I can't do.

09:55.952 --> 10:00.397
But what I was sending in, or if it was, this is what I said.

10:00.417 --> 10:03.481
It was a goddamn New York editor and nothing about the West.

10:04.802 --> 10:09.407
But anyway, they indicated that they just weren't happy with it, and I said, fine, let's just forget the whole thing.

10:09.828 --> 10:10.889
They never paid their money back.

10:10.909 --> 10:11.990
They never asked for it back.

10:12.751 --> 10:13.392
I'm looking for it.

10:13.472 --> 10:13.812
Here's one.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.357
So that was, in a way, the organ.

10:17.577 --> 10:35.501
And then... Then I was... I was just caught in so many other things.

10:35.521 --> 10:38.284
That I put the book out of my mind.

10:38.524 --> 10:40.347
That book out, or any book on Lewis.

10:40.427 --> 10:43.751
I never put the book on Lewis and Clark out of my mind.

10:43.771 --> 10:44.372
But I was...

10:47.508 --> 10:58.819
doing other things, although every summer we managed to get back to Montana and follow some part of the trail, or Idaho, or wherever.

11:01.302 --> 11:03.344
And I worked on other books, meanwhile.

11:04.825 --> 11:05.906
Quite a few of them.

11:05.926 --> 11:16.637
And then finally, I finished the D-Day, which is a book I looked forward to for a long time, and it plotted out more than ten years ago exactly the timing of the thing, when I would need to be where to get it.

11:19.199 --> 11:32.116
I finally had time to turn back to Lewis and Clark, and I wanted to, I figured my strengths are, I know a lot about the U.S.

11:32.136 --> 11:34.078
Army.

11:34.098 --> 11:35.400
I know I write a biography.

11:37.443 --> 11:47.616
I have traveled this ground, and what I ought to do with those assets is do a biography of one of the captains.

11:48.597 --> 11:49.138
I didn't really

11:49.827 --> 11:51.529
I didn't care which one.

11:51.649 --> 11:52.190
I did.

11:52.350 --> 12:07.570
I liked Lewis's... has got a... I don't quite want to say this, but I can't tell you the other way.

12:07.590 --> 12:09.632
He's got a depth to it that William Clark didn't have.

12:11.575 --> 12:14.398
Or maybe it's just the complexity of his character were greater.

12:14.438 --> 12:17.202
He was more appealing as a subject, too.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.419
Plus, he was the leader.

12:19.459 --> 12:20.200
He was the leader.

12:20.721 --> 12:25.988
And plus, anyone who was tutored by Thomas Jefferson has to be a fascinating character.

12:26.008 --> 12:26.488
That's right.

12:26.689 --> 12:31.034
On the other hand, William Clark had not had a biography yet.

12:32.076 --> 12:32.516
Interesting.

12:32.536 --> 12:39.465
And there was, by this time, a 30-year-old Lewis biography that was fair.

12:42.269 --> 12:44.151
But there had been 30 years of scholarship, so.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.473
And a lot more is known.

12:46.513 --> 12:52.981
But still, Clark had a very successful post-experience career, so that the ending is upbeat.

12:56.125 --> 12:59.129
And Clark has certainly got his appealing characteristics to him.

12:59.149 --> 13:02.172
So anyway, I called Eric Fritz in Montana.

13:02.232 --> 13:04.455
I said, Eric, do you know what everybody's doing with a Clark biography?

13:05.076 --> 13:07.239
Because none has ever been done.

13:07.259 --> 13:09.221
And he said, yeah, James Rond is doing one.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.484
And I said, oh, shit.

13:11.504 --> 13:12.785
And Rond is a good historian.

13:12.805 --> 13:14.948
And you quote him quite a bad book.

13:17.527 --> 13:31.870
Then Harry said, look, there's been 30 years of scholarship on this expedition, and it's something that Lewis and Clark people are really proud of the writer, so there really has been a big new, wonderful scholarship.

13:31.890 --> 13:38.701
And then I can bring two of those biographies, this kind of thing.

13:38.761 --> 13:40.243
I recently wrote to

13:42.147 --> 13:44.970
Hans von Luck, and John Howard, and Dick Winters.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.853
There are three company commanders from this.

13:46.873 --> 13:47.854
I don't know more.

13:47.874 --> 13:52.219
One American Airborne, one rear airborne, one German Panzer.

13:52.299 --> 13:56.725
And I've written about all three of them at some length.

13:56.745 --> 14:00.910
But I wrote to all three of them to thank them for teaching me what a good company commander is.

14:02.392 --> 14:05.996
And then I used those criteria in Gendron Lewis.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.922
So I was able to draw on

14:12.016 --> 14:17.083
It's a funny way to draw on things, from the future into the past.

14:18.265 --> 14:28.098
But I learned things from how those three, or all three of them as great soldiers, did their job, and then applied what their principles were to realists.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.122
They said, well, well, they matched.

14:32.564 --> 14:33.325
Well, maybe it's not.

14:33.345 --> 14:34.407
Maybe it's not even nobody.

14:34.547 --> 14:37.711
I mean, men are men in there who don't respond at the same time.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.335
But it's nice to put it down.

14:41.311 --> 14:53.045
I drew a lot on knowing about Eisenhower and Roosevelt and Truman and the Cold War and leadership from the top.

14:53.585 --> 14:58.351
And let me just interrupt, but also knowing a lot of these people personally, like Eisenhower.

14:58.371 --> 15:01.534
These are people that you interviewed in great depth.

15:01.554 --> 15:05.759
So this is not working from archival sources so much.

15:05.919 --> 15:09.023
So you haven't been able to judge these people as people.

15:09.897 --> 15:10.678
Yeah, that's right.

15:10.698 --> 15:12.360
That's right.

15:13.742 --> 15:18.829
I think all that helped me in dealing with trying to take a fresh look at Thomas Jefferson.

15:19.791 --> 15:23.275
How can you ever find a fresh point of view on Thomas Jefferson?

15:23.295 --> 15:28.503
And you can't really by just saying the West, in the opening of the West, but the relationship with Meriwether Lewis is fresh.

15:28.983 --> 15:30.105
That's nice.

15:30.165 --> 15:35.152
And it was very nice, you know.

15:36.233 --> 15:39.077
Just knowing the Washington scene from how it is and

15:40.306 --> 15:48.398
the 1990s, in the 1800s, it was in so many ways the same.

15:48.498 --> 15:50.502
The only difference was you didn't have electronic media.

15:52.244 --> 16:07.247
With the gossip and the backbiting and the shuffling for position and the reporting going out and the complaints of the politicians about the kind of reporting going out and so on.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.250
It's amazing because the politics of the thing

16:09.820 --> 16:13.044
For the Federalists and the political battles.

16:14.286 --> 16:18.271
And how partisan they were out there.

16:20.193 --> 16:26.822
I mean, when you think how they opposed the purchase of the Louisiana Purchase.

16:26.842 --> 16:30.787
The same way they opposed the purchase of Thomas Jefferson's books for the library.

16:30.807 --> 16:36.334
There was this very political division, you know, really stupid when you think about it.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.329
Do you consider this a biography, per se?

16:42.431 --> 16:48.659
I feel that you do approach it as a historian and as a biographer.

16:48.679 --> 16:49.821
Yeah, oh, very much so.

16:49.861 --> 16:54.507
And you even mention at some point, you say, now I'm going to talk as a biographer and a historian.

16:55.108 --> 17:00.656
You say at one point, well, I'm sure he kept these journals and they're out there someplace and we're going to find them.

17:01.317 --> 17:04.882
That's not the historian talking, that's the biographer talking.

17:04.902 --> 17:08.447
So that does allow you this latitude, doesn't it, to switch from one to another?

17:09.052 --> 17:11.175
Which is kind of fun.

17:11.195 --> 17:11.756
Very much so.

17:12.517 --> 17:18.806
I'm doing a book now on the campaign in Northwest Europe.

17:19.406 --> 17:23.372
There's a lot of guys that get these bolt bolsters up there.

17:24.133 --> 17:25.535
What I need is a map.

17:26.336 --> 17:38.653
And I... God damn, I forgot what we were talking about.

17:39.764 --> 17:42.968
I think we're talking about the two disciplines, biographies.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.990
Oh, right.

17:45.010 --> 17:48.374
We're talking about the next book.

17:48.415 --> 17:55.824
There is a point in there, and I'll remember.

17:55.844 --> 17:56.044
Oh.

17:58.787 --> 18:08.539
And in doing this book, and I just finished a chapter today, and I was switching from the high command to the guy in the field, as I did in the D-8 block.

18:09.869 --> 18:12.414
Over this time, we get a lot more time to the guy in the field.

18:12.434 --> 18:15.720
I just find him in more fascinating dollars.

18:16.862 --> 18:22.993
And Bradley Eisenhower, Mining End Fights, less than Austin.

18:23.013 --> 18:29.726
Of course, you've done some wonderful books in Eisenhower, though, which speaks to the other side of that.

18:31.409 --> 18:31.489
Hmm.

18:33.646 --> 18:39.852
I always try to look at it both as a biographer and a historian and see the meld between the two.

18:40.113 --> 18:51.184
I became a biographer because I was convinced early on that, of course it mattered who was living in the U.S.

18:51.204 --> 18:55.529
and William H. Seward would have failed.

18:55.549 --> 19:00.514
And, of course it mattered who commanded the armies, for Christ's sake,

19:01.557 --> 19:05.783
If the Union had lost to Gettysburg, it would be a whole different world.

19:05.823 --> 19:07.926
These things are important.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.207
How different, though, do you think?

19:10.109 --> 19:11.250
I mean, do you believe with H.L.

19:11.270 --> 19:18.039
Macon that at some point it would have resolved the differences, regardless of the outcome of the Civil War?

19:18.961 --> 19:22.145
No, I don't see that at all.

19:22.165 --> 19:23.126
Who knows what to think?

19:23.327 --> 19:25.870
I mean, we don't paint any scenario to watch it.

19:25.950 --> 19:29.455
The truth of the matter is, things would be a lot different.

19:32.236 --> 19:37.382
When you're talking about something like the Civil War, any outcome other than the one that we had could hardly have been better.

19:38.944 --> 19:39.525
Oh, I agree.

19:40.366 --> 19:41.587
Absolutely, of course.

19:41.607 --> 19:43.009
So any other is going to be worse.

19:43.029 --> 19:44.270
That's right.

19:44.290 --> 19:44.871
And then what?

19:44.891 --> 19:45.752
Well, I don't know what.

19:45.772 --> 19:46.593
Nobody knows what.

19:46.693 --> 19:48.415
But I know goddamn well that it matters.

19:49.156 --> 19:54.963
And that it mattered that General Grant was there in the wilderness to look over General Meade's shoulder.

19:56.705 --> 19:58.868
And it mattered to all of us who have lived since that instant.

20:01.936 --> 20:06.604
then we'll always continue to matter, so long as there is a republic.

20:06.624 --> 20:21.689
So I find these people that make these decisions, whether they're political or military, not just fascinating and all right, but they're so consequential.

20:22.891 --> 20:27.859
The mistake that dumb son of a bitch made has costed me today.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.963
God, he kept us out of war.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.026
We were better off for that, or whatever.

20:34.848 --> 20:35.428
It might be.

20:35.629 --> 20:41.876
It is a very important part of how I approach trying to meld the history and the biography and the one.

20:42.717 --> 20:44.799
Are you mindful of it all the time?

20:44.819 --> 20:59.095
Well, it's the impact of the individual on the situation from squad level through the high command in the war on to the White House and by to the Cold War.

20:59.665 --> 21:07.733
So, I asked David Herbert Donald, what do you consider yourself, a historian or a biographer?

21:07.753 --> 21:09.875
I guess we know him for his biographies.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.537
Well, I'm a historian, but I've written some pretty good biographies.

21:13.318 --> 21:16.581
I wonder how you would answer the same question, or are you both?

21:17.162 --> 21:20.385
Are you combining the disciplines?

21:23.328 --> 21:25.730
For my own part, I think that the disciplines are one.

21:26.911 --> 21:27.512
I remember

21:29.450 --> 21:43.808
When I was very junior, and I was at a meeting of the LSU history faculty to pick the speaker for the series, the named series that was the big deal there, each year in the issue department.

21:44.949 --> 21:51.097
And a book comes out of it and so on, and the whole academic thing is there.

21:54.100 --> 21:58.866
Harry Williams nominated Dick Koenig, and the chairman of the department said,

22:00.803 --> 22:02.805
We're not going to have any goddamn biographers.

22:06.469 --> 22:09.932
And Harry said, you're just wrong.

22:09.952 --> 22:13.816
Edwin was the guy that said, you're just wrong, Edwin.

22:13.836 --> 22:14.176
He is.

22:14.196 --> 22:15.437
And he talked about current a while.

22:15.457 --> 22:16.899
And I didn't think current wasn't right.

22:17.339 --> 22:23.886
But that scene stuck with me.

22:26.408 --> 22:27.469
And always in puzzling.

22:27.668 --> 22:31.392
Because I just never could see the difference between biography and history.

22:33.054 --> 22:34.095
Because history is people.

22:35.917 --> 22:36.738
And it's what they do.

22:36.758 --> 22:39.241
And it's what people choose and what decisions they make.

22:39.261 --> 22:42.144
And on the basis of which they make them.

22:43.226 --> 22:43.846
Et cetera.

22:45.168 --> 22:46.890
All that goes into a decision making.

22:48.412 --> 22:50.274
But it comes down to human affairs.

22:50.354 --> 22:56.781
And sooner or later, there's one isolated, lonely son of a bitch who's got to decide.

22:58.330 --> 23:01.614
We're going to do this or we're going to do that.

23:01.634 --> 23:17.315
And you try to figure out everything that went into his or her makeup right up to that instant of decision and how much information they've taken in and whether he or she had asked the right questions or whatever.

23:18.116 --> 23:24.825
So this whole concept of command, obviously, is something that seems to be a passion for you.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.127
It is, yeah.

23:26.832 --> 23:30.217
And I think we can see... It's funny, I've never been in charge of anything, really.

23:30.237 --> 23:38.129
I mean, lately in my life, I've come on, I'm president of a board for a museum, and I'm... Here, in town?

23:38.610 --> 23:40.833
Yeah, in the National Museum.

23:40.914 --> 23:41.715
Oh, that one, yeah.

23:41.775 --> 23:42.716
Well, that's in the world.

23:42.957 --> 23:47.283
And I took on something of an administrative role with the Eisenhower Center.

23:49.987 --> 23:54.915
But those little itsy-bitsy-keensies,

23:55.638 --> 23:59.402
taste of the reality of running an operation.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.125
I'm an academic and a writer.

24:03.306 --> 24:08.913
Here's what I think.

24:08.933 --> 24:16.561
And I don't have the skills and the experience and the knowledge to do it at all well, but I sure have studied it enough to have respect for those who can.

24:18.283 --> 24:25.611
Sit there and make those decisions and put them through and get people behind them.

24:27.312 --> 24:31.216
It's a... two rare towns.

24:32.398 --> 24:42.469
And I see it in the last ten years of my life, I've been thrown in with an awful lot more CEOs than I ever expected to meet in my life.

24:42.489 --> 24:43.570
Or a very rich man.

24:49.937 --> 24:55.463
And they...

25:00.910 --> 25:24.260
I think one element that we haven't considered, and it's essential because you say, I'm an academic and you're a teacher, which is, I guess, the same thing, but one thing we haven't taken into account is the fact that storytelling is very important.

25:24.280 --> 25:28.605
You're writing these books, but you are writing them to engage

25:28.973 --> 25:32.136
an audience beyond your colleagues, shall we say.

25:32.156 --> 25:32.957
Also the lecture.

25:33.738 --> 25:35.840
And teaching has been tremendously important to me.

25:37.542 --> 25:40.085
Because it's a lot of audience.

25:40.105 --> 25:46.332
Leaving all the other joys of teaching aside, and forgetting about the miseries, like reading essays, angles.

25:47.893 --> 25:49.095
I paid my dues on that.

25:52.038 --> 25:57.664
Teaching is an exhilarating experience because it's like a learning experience.

25:57.863 --> 26:09.797
The act of having to teach something is a propellant into learning something like nothing remotely else can.

26:09.817 --> 26:15.123
And so you learn an awful lot as part of the process of passing it on.

26:15.183 --> 26:25.035
And you're also learning how to pass it on so that they listen.

26:28.154 --> 26:36.546
And I think that the most important part of my writing is that I drive the narrative.

26:37.347 --> 26:40.832
I almost never flash back and I never flash forward.

26:41.994 --> 26:44.257
And I just keep that narrative driving along.

26:44.418 --> 26:45.980
And you learn that in the classroom.

26:47.202 --> 26:47.763
Interesting.

26:47.783 --> 26:53.471
You learn that you're watching those students and you appreciate that.

26:53.491 --> 26:56.355
Well, you know in an instant that you've lost them.

26:56.858 --> 26:57.919
You know, it's funny.

26:57.959 --> 27:04.447
Now, I hadn't, having read the book, it didn't occur to me that there were no flash-flowers or flashbacks.

27:04.888 --> 27:16.482
It is a continuous narrative, and you even have the chapters by months, by seasons, by... And the reason for... And the reason for... Is because that's the way it happened.

27:17.403 --> 27:25.853
And if you want to get into the mind of Merriweather Lewis, you can never be knowing, as author or reader, how it's going to turn out.

27:29.410 --> 27:32.534
And, of course, your readers are going to know vaguely how it's going to turn out.

27:32.554 --> 27:36.038
Now, when I'm writing about Eisenhower, they know, like, well, we're going to win World War II.

27:38.521 --> 27:50.776
And so what you've got to do is to try to create affection in the reader's mind so that as you go along and you're in July of 1944, I've got a son of a vigil.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.078
I know how this is going to turn out.

27:52.758 --> 27:53.900
I don't know how this is going to turn out.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.185
You have a scene in this book, Out in the River,

27:58.958 --> 28:25.422
one of the very early meetings with Indians, I forget which tribe it is, and something's going wrong, and they prime up the cannon and the bow, the blunderbusters, and he's ready to, and you speculate, well, what happens if, and this is what Jefferson was very concerned about, this hot-headed attitude of his to say we're going to fight, and you say, boy, this one instance right here could have, so that does, I think, give the reader a little bit of,

28:25.790 --> 28:28.933
apprehension, you know, it's a terrific device.

28:29.033 --> 28:31.275
It's a literary device is what it is.

28:31.295 --> 28:39.603
It is, and it brings up what is so important in history is chance.

28:41.084 --> 28:44.928
That little tiny incident could have led to that we lost the Northwest.

28:47.150 --> 28:52.995
I could skip you on a scenario, and we end up, we lose the Northwest because of that.

28:54.781 --> 29:06.914
Who the hell's poem is it that for one of the males who was lost?

29:06.955 --> 29:08.837
Funny, do you know?

29:08.857 --> 29:10.438
That is history.

29:11.480 --> 29:23.573
That's what makes history so much fun, and I think so instructive, and it's so fascinating.

29:24.008 --> 29:25.870
intermixed in that is biography.

29:26.551 --> 29:28.452
There isn't history without biography.

29:31.015 --> 29:43.267
And then people want to, and whether that's right or wrong, and fuck, I ain't gonna fight with the Marxists their way over my head on philosophy anyway, or anybody else on philosophy.

29:43.287 --> 29:50.134
But whether great men make history or whether

29:51.346 --> 29:52.888
History makes great men, yeah.

29:52.908 --> 29:57.714
History makes great men, and if Lincoln hadn't been there, somebody else wouldn't wear it.

29:57.734 --> 30:00.238
Well Eisenhower's the quintessential example, isn't he?

30:00.258 --> 30:03.162
I mean, who was a major at the start of World War II?

30:04.904 --> 30:05.004
Yeah.

30:05.024 --> 30:11.312
But that does speak to the size of the talent, how the talent pool is out there.

30:11.332 --> 30:12.954
Then and now.

30:14.837 --> 30:19.463
God, when we start to hire a man in the practice of the museum, it's incredible.

30:19.898 --> 30:22.741
Credentials.

30:23.722 --> 30:24.343
How about the people?

30:24.883 --> 30:26.045
Well, I agree.

30:26.065 --> 30:27.887
But that's... That's another story.

30:27.907 --> 30:28.007
Yeah.

30:31.591 --> 30:33.052
No, I forgot again where we were.

30:33.073 --> 30:33.974
But we're doing fine.

30:34.594 --> 30:37.898
We're talking about storytelling and narrative and the what-ifs story.

30:37.918 --> 30:38.098
Yeah.

30:38.118 --> 30:39.500
And the what-ifs of history.

30:40.240 --> 30:45.386
Yeah, so... History is chance.

30:47.148 --> 30:48.049
Just like evolution.

30:49.312 --> 30:52.757
It's not the survival of the fittest, it's the survival of the luckiest.

30:53.539 --> 31:04.476
It really is true, both in species and in human organizations, whether they're tribes or whatever.

31:05.898 --> 31:09.764
And a lot of it depends on how well they're able to make war.

31:10.585 --> 31:12.027
And people hate to hear that.

31:12.048 --> 31:17.496
But, thank God, I'd love to read about it.

31:20.598 --> 31:33.557
At some point, of course, it's irresistible, from my point of view, but where you have already said how fascinated you are with the whole concept of decision-making and command.

31:33.597 --> 31:42.449
And, of course, we've all read about your friendship with General Powell and your advising.

31:42.489 --> 31:49.980
There must be qualities in him that you have seen that relate to some of the things you've been telling me about here.

31:50.146 --> 31:56.294
I don't know if it's stretching it a little bit, but, you know, something to think about.

31:57.276 --> 31:58.758
Listen, on General Powell, I'm very good.

31:58.838 --> 32:04.465
You want the 60-second, the 2-minute, the 5-minute, or the 15-minute?

32:04.485 --> 32:05.967
15?

32:05.987 --> 32:07.309
No, I'm not 15.

32:07.329 --> 32:11.855
General Powell is a genuinely great manager, great leader.

32:11.955 --> 32:14.719
He is, in my opinion,

32:19.559 --> 32:24.064
quite possibly the best man in the earth has produced in this century.

32:24.084 --> 32:27.868
And for my part, the only rival that I would see would be Martin Luther King Jr.

32:30.972 --> 32:45.668
And that's because Powell has the qualities of leadership that are unique in the West,

32:49.343 --> 32:53.147
I don't use the word unique the way the television reporter did it.

32:53.167 --> 32:53.808
I knew what I said.

32:55.750 --> 32:56.911
This includes Eisenhower.

32:56.931 --> 32:59.994
You mean one of a kind, is what you're saying.

33:00.014 --> 33:00.815
I mean, unique.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.738
Yeah, unique.

33:03.798 --> 33:06.141
I don't mean true freshmen, as I'm sitting out here.

33:07.923 --> 33:13.729
I always want to meet some of these false freshmen I never seem to.

33:13.749 --> 33:16.532
But... Now, you base this on...

33:17.187 --> 33:22.774
I mean, were you attracted to these qualities before knowing him or by studying him?

33:22.794 --> 33:30.943
No, I'm attracted to General Powell because of who he is and what he has said and what he does and what he stands for and how he does it.

33:32.545 --> 33:34.448
But it all comes down to your right.

33:34.508 --> 33:41.296
It comes down to, I'm a student of leadership and I think this man is the greatest leader in this country who's produced in this century.

33:41.316 --> 33:42.197
It's quite a statement.

33:42.417 --> 33:42.998
I know it is.

33:43.679 --> 33:44.780
I'm well aware that it is.

33:45.881 --> 33:46.502
And we've only got

33:46.938 --> 33:52.406
four years left to the end of the century, so you're basically including the whole run, basically.

33:52.426 --> 33:52.987
The whole run.

33:53.087 --> 33:59.077
Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Frank Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, maybe Harry Truman, they would be the rivals.

34:00.058 --> 34:05.346
Then maybe Henry Ford, maybe John D. Rockefeller.

34:05.366 --> 34:10.254
There's no... no attorney than the rival.

34:10.294 --> 34:12.597
Not Persian, not MacArthur, not even close.

34:13.278 --> 34:14.380
I'm just wondering what

34:15.406 --> 34:17.129
accomplishments you base this on.

34:17.149 --> 34:18.891
Is this character that you're judging?

34:18.931 --> 34:19.592
Character.

34:19.612 --> 34:22.176
Character and personality and experience.

34:22.196 --> 34:27.864
Because when you're talking about... I mean, when you talk about the Gulf War... You don't want to write a lot of Carol Powell in this.

34:27.884 --> 34:29.587
I want to put a line in... If you do.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.069
All right, all right.

34:31.189 --> 34:32.511
I'm not going to deceive you.

34:32.551 --> 34:35.896
Powell's accomplishments are many and varied.

34:37.899 --> 34:41.384
Vietnam, two tours, with distinction.

34:44.709 --> 34:45.210
And then...

34:45.528 --> 34:53.719
as a corps commander in Germany, as a battalion commander in Korea, and he's gone up the run that is the U.S.

34:53.839 --> 35:12.323
Army, and has emerged from that, first as advisor, then as chairman, and so dealing with the province in the absolute top, it just knows more about force than how to use it than anybody else in the country, period.

35:12.924 --> 35:14.286
Nobody else is even close.

35:15.633 --> 35:19.116
And he adds to that, he's black, but not all that poor.

35:20.458 --> 35:21.259
He's good looking.

35:22.560 --> 35:23.921
He comes out of the military.

35:23.961 --> 35:36.013
He can bring a Republican candidate, minimum, absolutely minimum, 35% of the black vote, and then it's all for the Democrats.

35:36.033 --> 35:38.816
That's Colin Powell.

35:38.836 --> 35:40.377
He's going to be president of the United States.

35:41.819 --> 35:43.260
And you can put that in.

35:44.337 --> 35:49.807
If you decide to, but I mean, this is not off track or anything or any bullshit or anything else.

35:49.827 --> 35:51.270
This is my deepest belief.

35:51.290 --> 35:54.435
He's going to be president of the United States.

35:54.455 --> 35:57.982
And it's going to be a great day for us, and it's going to be a great day for the world.

35:58.002 --> 36:04.253
It's going to do more for race relations than any other single thing we could do around the world.

36:06.983 --> 36:10.006
And there's a Republican, no less.

36:10.146 --> 36:11.127
And there's a Republican.

36:11.167 --> 36:18.515
He's going to bring the Republican Party back to the mainstream after they blow this election.

36:18.535 --> 36:19.997
After the Republicans blow it.

36:20.017 --> 36:20.277
Yeah.

36:20.297 --> 36:21.638
Because they're probably going to blow it.

36:21.778 --> 36:22.499
They're going to blow it.

36:22.519 --> 36:23.540
Of course they're going to blow it.

36:23.560 --> 36:28.425
They're going to run Bob Dole, and he's going to get 42 percent, and Bill's going to get 43 percent, and Bill's going to win.

36:30.287 --> 36:31.489
That's where it's looking, sure.

36:32.430 --> 36:34.712
That's the way it looks to me.

36:35.215 --> 36:40.282
Well, be clear that this is my principal concern by any measure.

36:40.323 --> 37:02.455
They asked me to ask you about Powell, and it'll be a couple graphs at the bottom of the piece, but... I just had a letter from the General of the Day, and he said, thanks for this book, and I'll be reading it this week, and then said... What I had been really responding to was I had said,

37:03.447 --> 37:05.008
I told him it was a class story.

37:05.028 --> 37:07.671
I'm going to tell you this in a minute ago.

37:07.691 --> 37:13.936
I told him it was, and he called up after the press conference.

37:13.956 --> 37:15.678
And he said, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

37:15.698 --> 37:19.842
And I said, you know, and he cut me off.

37:19.862 --> 37:27.108
He said, you know, I want to hear always the hardest decision I've ever made.

37:29.490 --> 37:31.632
And I really thought, I'm sure that's true.

37:32.135 --> 37:39.503
I'm afraid that's the line he's been using with the minimum of dozens, hundreds of people he's got to call.

37:43.788 --> 37:51.136
And so I said, General, let me cut you off, and I don't always say the four stars, and tell you a story.

37:52.757 --> 38:01.787
When Lewis and Clark got to the Moth and Marias River on the 3rd of June in 1805,

38:03.252 --> 38:04.554
They hadn't expected it.

38:04.574 --> 38:07.658
They were a thousand miles out and more from St.

38:07.698 --> 38:08.018
Louis.

38:11.082 --> 38:14.286
And they had explicit instructions to follow Missouri to its source.

38:15.347 --> 38:18.932
Suddenly, here was a fork in the river, and they didn't know which one was the true Missouri.

38:21.155 --> 38:24.799
So they camped for four days to send out expeditions to look up the rivers.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.642
Smartly make judgments.

38:29.365 --> 38:33.090
And came back, and the men to a man, as you said,

38:33.425 --> 38:43.177
Lewis wrote in the journal, felt that the right-hand fork was the one intruder's area.

38:43.197 --> 38:48.323
But Captain Clark and myself felt that the left-hand fork was in the area.

38:49.785 --> 38:57.614
And then Lewis says in his journal, the men, to a man, said, no, Captain, you're wrong.

38:59.016 --> 39:03.381
But they added very cheerfully, we will follow you wherever you direct.

39:04.323 --> 39:06.265
And I said, come ask us the way I feel, Marty.

39:06.785 --> 39:09.328
I want you to ask today.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.509
And he said, exactly what I feel.

39:12.251 --> 39:12.871
He said, thanks.

39:12.911 --> 39:13.472
That's a lot.

39:13.612 --> 39:16.875
Go ahead, man.

39:16.895 --> 39:19.738
I'm sorry, go ahead.

39:23.962 --> 39:27.065
And so he wrote today to say, I'd send him a copy of his book.

39:27.086 --> 39:33.672
I said, obviously your time is, but I hope you can just look at it.

39:34.208 --> 39:36.491
I think you'll be mesmerized by it.

39:37.292 --> 39:43.480
And as you pointed out also, it's the only instance in the history of the United States Army where you had a successful joint command.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.582
I mean, it's unbelievable.

39:45.983 --> 39:50.428
That actually was able to work.

39:50.448 --> 40:00.241
And the extraordinary goodwill of Lewis to not only invite him, but to assure him, even after they make him a lieutenant, make Clark a lieutenant, which is... It's a wonderful story.

40:00.261 --> 40:02.003
It's a great story, yeah.

40:03.305 --> 40:03.625
It's...

40:05.647 --> 40:10.252
I tried a novel once.

40:10.633 --> 40:12.755
Lewis and Clark novel.

40:12.855 --> 40:16.259
Yeah, I was going to do the diary of one of the privates.

40:16.279 --> 40:16.840
How long ago?

40:16.880 --> 40:17.480
George Shannon.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.702
Oh, this was about ten years ago.

40:19.423 --> 40:23.727
So you're still trying to get something out of that strip, I can see, right?

40:26.150 --> 40:32.177
One of the things that drives me is I would always have to prepare to stand in front of that IRS judge.

40:33.490 --> 40:40.619
And I'm always prepared to stand around and say, Your Honor, I'd never leave the house without a profit board.

40:40.639 --> 40:48.449
And every trip that I take is a tax deduction because I'm looking at the local place to see if... That's what a writer does.

40:49.591 --> 40:50.913
Totally legitimate.

40:50.993 --> 40:55.438
I haven't had to stand in front of the judge yet.

40:58.122 --> 41:02.147
You'll see how if he agrees with that assessment...

41:04.237 --> 41:05.358
We got a good start here.

41:05.778 --> 41:06.719
Yeah, good.

41:06.739 --> 41:07.700
This is good stuff.

41:07.720 --> 41:08.721
This is good stuff.

41:08.741 --> 41:10.723
Good.

41:10.743 --> 41:11.163
Terrific.

41:13.466 --> 41:15.407
Well, yeah, great.

41:15.688 --> 41:21.854
We're going to go out in about... Let's go down and have another beer and a Coca-Cola.

41:21.874 --> 41:22.554
I'll find another beer.

41:22.894 --> 41:32.283
And this place is... Let me talk about food a little bit.

41:32.303 --> 41:34.125
This is...

41:34.949 --> 41:37.051
This is our best restaurant on the coast.

41:38.693 --> 41:46.843
And it's a chef from New Orleans who wanted what almost all the people who live along this road to Ujurnalong from wanted.

41:46.903 --> 41:51.889
They're all people who, one way or another, made their clear in New Orleans.

41:51.909 --> 41:53.811
And they come over here to live.

41:53.831 --> 41:55.773
And the chef is one of those.

41:57.135 --> 42:03.302
So this is as good a chef as you would get virtually anywhere in New Orleans.

42:04.598 --> 42:06.642
They have little funky kinds of plates.

42:06.662 --> 42:07.905
So that's where we're going to dinner.

42:08.346 --> 42:13.756
Now, Marl, since we got it started, that's what I wanted to do.

42:13.776 --> 42:15.801
We could do another hour, hour and a half in the morning.

42:15.821 --> 42:16.502
I think so, yeah.

42:16.522 --> 42:17.664
And you guys are free.

42:18.666 --> 42:22.474
And go into the quarter and then, Christ, this is going to work near the table.

42:22.494 --> 42:23.756
It's all good.

42:23.797 --> 42:26.522
We were there for an ABA about 10 years ago.

42:27.008 --> 42:27.909
It's all good.

42:27.990 --> 42:29.332
It's all good.

42:29.612 --> 42:31.295
People don't come here for nothing.

42:31.716 --> 42:32.878
It's just good.

42:34.020 --> 42:41.172
You drive in and get yourself a good parking place in the corner, and then you'll just have a wonderful time.

42:41.332 --> 42:42.874
We're at the Missouri River Breaks.

42:43.616 --> 42:44.637
On this photograph here.

42:44.657 --> 42:46.300
This is your family on the Missouri River.

42:48.153 --> 42:51.098
You look like a pretty tough out there.

42:51.198 --> 42:52.621
I was looking at the map.

42:52.681 --> 42:53.522
I was looking at the map.

42:53.543 --> 42:56.147
I always loved that picture except that I'm not looking ahead.

42:56.267 --> 42:58.511
But I know exactly what happened.

42:58.611 --> 43:00.795
You kind of look like Murray and the Lewis thing yourself there.

43:00.815 --> 43:03.460
I had the map down on my knees and I was looking at that map.

43:04.642 --> 43:05.003
Wow.

43:05.343 --> 43:07.427
Isn't that nice?

43:08.639 --> 43:12.002
Yeah, you see tons of these pelicans flying by.

43:12.022 --> 43:13.303
Well, you mentioned that, too.

43:13.463 --> 43:20.449
You say that at one point, they see a three-mile-long feathers coming down the river.

43:20.990 --> 43:22.051
And these rifles over here.

43:22.071 --> 43:24.053
Look at all these rifles.

43:24.073 --> 43:25.414
There's a bust of Eisenhower.

43:25.434 --> 43:26.975
We haven't even talked about it.

43:27.115 --> 43:29.297
We have to get that in at some point, too.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.242
I guess it was the second summer.

43:35.062 --> 43:38.005
That's our daughter, Stephanie, who...

43:40.364 --> 43:54.540
announced the previous summer, which was our first time in the state, that she said, Dad, your grandchildren have been born and raised in Montana, as a result of this family excursion, right?

43:55.061 --> 44:09.257
And she then went to the University of Montana, I think probably the fall after this summer, and by her senior year she was living with a Montana boy, and they went to graduate school and then got married,

44:09.592 --> 44:11.975
married now and have kids.

44:12.015 --> 44:14.738
They are bred and born and being raised in Montana.

44:15.479 --> 44:21.086
And she was 16 when she announced that before she'd even met him.

44:21.527 --> 44:24.871
This is, this is, yeah, this is up in, this is the Missouri River.

44:27.855 --> 44:30.859
And you can see this, and we took this picture to illustrate this.

44:30.879 --> 44:34.283
This is irrigated by everyone's own wheat.

44:34.415 --> 44:41.626
So if they have a pump down here to draw water out of the river and throw it onto those plants, you can see what happened.

44:41.646 --> 44:43.929
With the rats, this is what Lewis and Clark saw.

44:45.832 --> 44:53.583
I mean, the sergeant dies early on and that's, you know.

44:54.605 --> 44:54.985
That's it.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.047
That's it.

44:56.067 --> 44:56.808
One guy caught him.

44:56.828 --> 45:03.578
This is, oh, let me tell you this one.

45:03.929 --> 45:21.974
This was taken at the very headwaters of the Missouri River, where Lewis records in his journal that Neal stood exultingly with a foot on each side of this little rivulet, and thank his God that he had lived with his stride the mighty and heretofore deemed endless Missouri River.

45:21.994 --> 45:24.077
And there I am striding the Missouri River.

45:24.397 --> 45:25.679
That's the Missouri River.

45:25.739 --> 45:26.961
That's the Missouri River.

45:26.981 --> 45:28.283
Wow.

45:28.303 --> 45:29.745
Who's this handsome guy?

45:29.785 --> 45:33.750
That looks like a naval officer lieutenant there.

45:34.253 --> 45:38.157
I'm a former Naval officer myself, but we had the white hats when I was then.

45:38.678 --> 45:41.180
The Navy's always had the best uniform.

45:41.201 --> 45:41.581
The best.

45:41.661 --> 45:43.363
The Navy beats everybody.

45:43.383 --> 45:44.164
Hands down.

45:44.204 --> 45:44.884
Hands down.

45:45.025 --> 45:47.167
It's true.

45:47.567 --> 45:47.988
It's true.

45:48.749 --> 45:49.950
I tell my wife that.

45:50.010 --> 45:51.231
She doesn't believe me.

45:51.512 --> 45:54.255
The Air Force looks like they're a bus driver.

45:54.275 --> 45:57.098
Okay, it's on.

45:57.638 --> 46:02.944
After December 12,

46:03.245 --> 46:05.668
Right.

46:05.688 --> 46:12.315
I'll be at 1606 Hauser, H-A-U-S-E-R, Helena, Montana, 59601.

46:14.498 --> 46:15.859
Okay.

46:17.441 --> 46:20.745
And the telephone number there is 406-443-7943.

46:20.905 --> 46:21.666
Correct.

46:21.966 --> 46:22.807
Good.

46:27.433 --> 46:29.455
I'll be working on this next week.

46:30.818 --> 46:31.379
Good stuff.

46:31.399 --> 46:33.244
Say that again.

46:33.264 --> 46:34.947
What I do is storytelling.

46:34.967 --> 46:35.849
I'm a storyteller.

46:36.531 --> 46:46.654
And when I bring to a class, or writing, doesn't matter.

46:46.674 --> 46:47.215
At the computer.

46:47.316 --> 46:49.300
In my mind, yeah, at the computer.

46:49.448 --> 47:01.360
In my mind, I'm sitting around a campfire, and I want to tell the story in a certain way that everybody's leaning forward just a little bit, because they don't want to miss what's coming next.

47:03.623 --> 47:10.550
And it's surprising to me how many historians don't understand that.

47:11.350 --> 47:13.853
And so they're flashing forward and back all the time.

47:14.069 --> 47:20.890
and they lose all the tension that is just built into the story if you just tell it as a story.

47:21.376 --> 47:23.619
Armand says yes, you see.

47:23.719 --> 47:41.080
Emory Upton and Henry Halleck and... and other figures I've written about, they're all unique.

47:41.100 --> 47:49.510
But... Meriwether Lewis... Greatest leader of all.

47:49.692 --> 48:00.340
In his own little tiny sphere, there's only a platoon of men, there's 32 men.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.643
Amazing.

48:02.112 --> 48:09.759
But he took them across the continent, and he got them back, and he drew out a little more than they ever thought they had in them to give.

48:11.220 --> 48:15.104
So that's leadership, that's command, too, I think.

48:15.124 --> 48:16.806
And that's exactly right.

48:17.646 --> 48:25.554
A different CO never could have gotten that expedition across the mountains, much less down the Pacific period.

48:25.574 --> 48:26.354
He just couldn't have done it.

48:27.415 --> 48:30.398
You mentioned earlier tonight that instead of doing Clark,

48:30.732 --> 48:37.629
But he is kind of the other presence of the book, isn't he?

48:37.649 --> 48:40.155
Yeah, and I think that's accurate.

48:44.125 --> 48:45.248
Jefferson Pick Lewis.

48:45.532 --> 48:47.055
and told Lewis to pick the crew.

48:48.960 --> 48:59.543
And Lewis did, and he picked as a part of the crew, William Clark, and Clark's commission came down as a lieutenant.

48:59.763 --> 49:01.026
Lewis had promised Clark

49:01.259 --> 49:11.071
I don't think that it was that way.

49:11.111 --> 49:12.953
I don't think it was a cold command.

49:13.073 --> 49:21.102
I think that William Clark and Meriwether Lewis always knew between them that if they ever had a disagreement, Lewis was in command.

49:22.944 --> 49:24.246
They never had a disagreement.

49:25.694 --> 49:27.698
They could not have anticipated that.

49:27.758 --> 49:32.326
Nobody could have anticipated that.

49:32.346 --> 49:33.408
And so we don't know.

49:33.608 --> 49:40.581
But if they had had a disagreement, Lewis was the one in the position to say, this is what we're going to do.

49:40.983 --> 49:46.732
And he also had the presidential commission, which I think is... Because he had a presidential commission in his pocket.

49:46.792 --> 49:53.221
Which we have to take, you know, not to be taken lightly, I don't think.

49:53.562 --> 50:00.652
But you mentioned, again, it's looking at these little things, reading these little journal entries.

50:00.672 --> 50:03.457
Lewis writes back a letter, which is while they're preparing.

50:03.877 --> 50:04.799
And he says, look for this.

50:04.819 --> 50:06.020
Will you go through my desk?

50:07.142 --> 50:07.863
It's in my desk.

50:07.883 --> 50:08.604
It's in my letters.

50:09.125 --> 50:10.467
And so you...

50:10.733 --> 50:22.711
Steve Ambrose says, it's just one little phrase, but how implicit is the trust this man has and the other man to say, go through my private stuff.

50:22.731 --> 50:26.697
I give you permission to look to my desk, to my personal offense.

50:26.778 --> 50:30.443
That tells you something about this kind of symbiotic relationship.

50:30.463 --> 50:31.945
It was a wonderful friendship.

50:32.546 --> 50:36.893
But you figure that out and you develop that into a sort of thing.

50:36.873 --> 50:44.082
which I'm marveling at your craft as a writer, picking that little thing up.

50:44.122 --> 50:46.465
But thanks.

50:47.266 --> 50:54.255
I've been telling my wife, I said, honey, when I'm done.

50:54.395 --> 50:57.859
Who the hell wouldn't enjoy anything like this?

50:57.919 --> 51:00.062
Of course I'm enjoying the hell out of it.

51:00.380 --> 51:17.443
it's especially nice to have people saying that you're doing this and you're doing that and i've been doing this all my life and i've been working at it and i've been trying to be a better storyteller for pushing 40 years now

51:17.693 --> 51:38.852
I have to say I kind of directed us toward that because your scholarship is outstanding, it's magnificent, and you insist on the footnotes and the text as opposed to endnotes.

51:38.872 --> 51:40.273
That's kind of a very traditional scholarly way to do things.

51:40.293 --> 51:46.559
But you're really focusing on the storytelling and not boring the reader.

51:46.579 --> 51:47.500
And it shows.

51:47.520 --> 51:47.700
It shows.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.062
It's wonderful.

51:49.082 --> 51:51.546
History should be accessible.

51:51.706 --> 51:57.614
I think it's the height of arrogance to wait for your colleagues and other professionals.

51:57.634 --> 52:02.181
I think that history not only ought to be accessible, but it is critical.

52:07.008 --> 52:16.962
To know where you've been, you've got to know where you're going.

52:17.330 --> 52:24.656
And you cannot know where you're at unless you know how you got there.

52:24.776 --> 52:26.458
It's an old navigator's rule.

52:27.178 --> 52:29.140
I've done some sailing.

52:29.160 --> 52:33.544
And you can't figure out where you're at unless you can figure out how you got to where I'm at.

52:33.664 --> 52:35.906
And then where you're going after that.

52:37.968 --> 52:41.090
I don't know that history has a lot to tell us about where we're going after that.

52:42.351 --> 52:46.695
It would be nice to say that

52:46.675 --> 52:53.506
If you'd only study history more, folks, you wouldn't make mistakes, but obviously that's not true.

52:53.526 --> 52:54.788
And it won't help you.

52:55.910 --> 52:58.634
Do you know what else?

52:58.654 --> 53:06.126
Well, I read Bill and Elaine's wonderful magisterial six-volume biography of Jefferson.

53:06.146 --> 53:07.589
Yeah, it is one of my favorites, yeah.

53:07.609 --> 53:10.253
You read the phrase sine qua non a couple of times in the books.

53:10.493 --> 53:13.999
That is a sine qua non Jefferson biography.

53:13.979 --> 53:32.135
Jefferson, towards the end of the book, you imagine Lewis is home and he's got his map.

53:32.456 --> 53:36.199
And Jefferson is falling on the wall.

53:36.559 --> 53:38.922
Isn't that scene wonderful?

53:38.942 --> 53:41.444
That is such a wonderful, wonderful scene.

53:41.564 --> 53:42.805
Jefferson is waiting.

53:42.785 --> 54:04.843
I don't invent anything.

54:05.161 --> 54:09.088
If they didn't say anything, I don't use it.

54:09.148 --> 54:11.452
I mean, it's what they said.

54:11.613 --> 54:17.644
So let's see where Jefferson is on his knees going over the chart prepared by Lewis.

54:18.846 --> 54:21.250
This is based on Jefferson's own testimony.

54:21.411 --> 54:22.893
Yeah, exactly.

54:22.913 --> 54:23.414
Exactly.

54:24.035 --> 54:24.636
Jefferson said it.

54:24.656 --> 54:25.778
We got down on our knees.

54:26.099 --> 54:26.860
We looked at the map.

54:27.001 --> 54:27.241
Cut.

54:28.203 --> 54:28.283
Cut.

54:29.123 --> 54:30.164
from his writing.

54:30.685 --> 54:34.048
But, you know, you can just imagine the scene.

54:34.568 --> 54:36.130
Oh, imagine it.

54:36.150 --> 54:38.892
I'm not thrilled by it, actually.

54:39.433 --> 54:42.996
There they are, down on their knees, looking at this goddamn map.

54:43.737 --> 54:46.860
Whoa, oh, that's what it's like.

54:47.361 --> 54:54.928
You can hope this book connects with

54:56.917 --> 55:00.562
the whole environmental movement.

55:00.602 --> 55:09.233
Because this is the North American environment and what most of us think of is at its first time.

55:10.214 --> 55:15.501
And certainly that was true for Missouri and all the way to Idaho and beyond the Pacific.

55:15.521 --> 55:20.427
This is how it was.

55:23.242 --> 55:52.000
And it's fascinating to see it from the point of view of those who were living there, whether Indian or white, and trying to make a living and I guess survive in these mountains and these galleys and these plains.

55:51.980 --> 56:00.792
All of us would like to have been there.

56:01.177 --> 56:05.423
Not all of us, but some of us who desperately have loved to have been here.

56:05.523 --> 56:05.964
Yeah.

56:06.084 --> 56:06.424
I think.

56:07.967 --> 56:10.210
Not everyone wants to have been here.

56:10.310 --> 56:10.851
I guess not.

56:10.911 --> 56:12.633
I guess that's right.

56:13.114 --> 56:14.035
I'm sure that's right.

56:14.135 --> 56:18.281
Ask my wife if she would like to take a trip to the moon before we say no.

56:18.602 --> 56:19.804
I would love to go.

56:19.824 --> 56:22.888
But God, there's a lot of people, God, we'd like to have been first.

56:24.911 --> 56:29.277
God, wouldn't I have loved to have seen this country when I didn't know it was around the bend of the river.

56:29.408 --> 56:35.621
You say that Lewis compares himself to Columbus.

56:35.681 --> 56:36.663
Another great scene.

56:37.044 --> 56:39.469
And he said, you know what, he's on the money here.

56:39.810 --> 56:41.273
He is.

56:41.353 --> 56:42.736
And he was, wasn't he?

56:42.756 --> 56:43.317
That's right.

56:44.208 --> 56:47.552
I mean, he's forcing them.

56:48.894 --> 56:49.054
Nothing.

56:49.074 --> 56:49.895
Nothing.

56:50.096 --> 56:56.404
Charles Jefferson taught him how to do things, and he set them up to a crash course in Philadelphia.

56:56.544 --> 56:59.728
Celestial fixes and things like that.

56:59.748 --> 57:03.733
And yet, boy, his river is perfect.

57:03.873 --> 57:07.118
His track coming from a perfect map.

57:07.138 --> 57:11.363
It's a little less if it's a little shaky, but, you know, so unbelievable.

57:11.343 --> 57:22.492
Dick, I'll tell you, if that comes down to for me, it would have been fun to have been Dwight Eisenhower.

57:22.512 --> 57:26.095
And the big problems were obviously handled.

57:26.115 --> 57:27.637
It would have been fun to be Dick Nixon.

57:29.398 --> 57:39.046
The big problems, and a lot of them didn't turn out well, to say the least.

57:39.227 --> 57:40.928
I'd like to have been Meriwether Lewis.

57:41.363 --> 57:42.805
Or with them, at least?

57:42.825 --> 57:43.746
I'd like to have been with them.

57:45.228 --> 57:46.771
I'd like to have been marching beside them.

57:48.353 --> 57:52.719
I'd like to have been tested in the way that they were tested.

57:53.199 --> 57:56.845
And I think I would have survived, I think, if I was 22, 21.

57:56.865 --> 58:01.111
I was playing football in those years.

58:02.112 --> 58:03.414
What did you play?

58:03.434 --> 58:06.318
What was your position?

58:06.358 --> 58:07.219
Middle guard.

58:10.388 --> 58:13.013
Middle linebacker and left guard.

58:13.134 --> 58:14.436
It was 60 minute days.

58:15.238 --> 58:18.605
I'm the last Big Ten player who played 60 minutes.

58:18.805 --> 58:19.366
The last.

58:21.451 --> 58:22.513
Nobody's done it since.

58:23.274 --> 58:24.797
I did it against Ohio State.

58:25.679 --> 58:27.302
You played in Wisconsin?

58:27.323 --> 58:28.264
In Wisconsin.

58:28.365 --> 58:30.810
Did you beat the Buckeyes or what?

58:31.090 --> 58:31.992
One out of three.

58:33.035 --> 58:36.981
Don't talk about it.

58:37.001 --> 58:37.782
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

58:37.842 --> 58:48.278
But, but, out of all the... It's so fiddly.

58:48.298 --> 58:51.162
I mean, it's worth comparing it.

58:51.530 --> 58:56.597
I think the great thing, it would have been wonderful to go to Washington and Valley Forest.

58:56.897 --> 58:57.919
It would have been wonderful.

58:59.180 --> 59:00.202
It would have been wonderful.

59:00.222 --> 59:01.363
It would have been wonderful.

59:02.425 --> 59:10.055
And to have been with the 29th Division on D-Day and survived would have been wonderful.

59:11.858 --> 59:19.528
I think all the wonderful, wonderful things with Lewis and Clark crossing the Continental Divide

59:19.795 --> 59:22.959
Descending to the Pacific.

59:22.979 --> 59:25.863
That had to be the highest high of ever.

59:26.103 --> 59:26.584
Of ever.

59:26.684 --> 59:27.925
For anybody, anywhere.

59:28.286 --> 59:31.149
Well, would you like to go... Now, obviously, Columbus compares.

59:32.191 --> 59:35.475
Obviously, Magellan compares.

59:35.655 --> 59:39.820
Obviously, Captain Cook compares.

59:39.840 --> 59:45.527
But the truth is, I'd like to have been with Lewis and Clark.

59:45.547 --> 59:47.710
And that's just my predecessors in America.

59:47.690 --> 59:59.410
That was our continent that they crossed, and they're the ones that tied us together, west and east.

59:59.430 --> 01:00:06.762
I just anticipated the question I was going to ask, because personally, I said, you must be basing this on your pride in America.

01:00:06.742 --> 01:00:10.146
Because I would love to have been with Captain Cook.

01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:11.047
Have you ever seen the art?

01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:16.593
Wouldn't it have been wonderful if Lewis and Clark had been able to bring along artists?

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.735
One of their biggest mistakes, yes.

01:00:18.755 --> 01:00:20.837
The way Cook brought along artists.

01:00:21.198 --> 01:00:24.441
That would have been wonderful.

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:25.923
And they should have done it.

01:00:26.504 --> 01:00:27.705
There's no excuse.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.488
It drives me nuts.

01:00:30.687 --> 01:00:37.333
When I look at the paintings, I have the Yale edition of the Three Warriors, Captain Cook's paintings.

01:00:37.353 --> 01:00:38.980
He brought a lot of artists.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.389
And you should see the four paintings.
