WEBVTT

00:03.710 --> 00:10.181
There's another one on this page.

00:11.963 --> 00:12.925
No, the red.

00:12.985 --> 00:16.611
Why would they just pick, like, that one letter on that one page?

00:16.691 --> 00:20.457
Well, they ought to do the—well, they did—it had capitals, you see.

00:20.477 --> 00:21.198
That was practiced.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.546
Most Gutenberg Bibles had that done in other early printed books.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.709
I guess they didn't manage to see the A out there.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.533
You can find another capitalist page and see.

00:30.854 --> 00:32.556
So it would be every capital letter, then?

00:33.357 --> 00:35.200
In theory, it should be every capital letter.

00:36.021 --> 00:38.825
What's your theory about what this publication is?

00:38.845 --> 00:40.608
Well, it's a very important publication.

00:40.628 --> 00:42.010
Well, there's no question about that.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.375
What's my theory about what it is?

00:46.256 --> 00:49.461
Is it in your mind, does it precede

00:49.947 --> 00:53.391
No, it does not, because it's in 1456.

00:53.451 --> 00:55.334
Oh, it's dated.

00:55.354 --> 00:56.055
It's dated there.

00:56.095 --> 01:07.570
Well, he gave it in Rome, and it had to be printed after that date, in 1456, in the calendar of July.

01:07.590 --> 01:09.011
I see.

01:09.031 --> 01:12.436
It would probably be printed that fall, or something, I would guess.

01:12.456 --> 01:13.277
Okay.

01:13.297 --> 01:14.959
No, there's no dollars later than the Bible.

01:15.698 --> 01:20.204
But it's a type that I have a feeling has been lying around for a while.

01:21.445 --> 01:25.270
And there is a pea, for example.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.292
It has something knocked out of it.

01:27.312 --> 01:31.417
There's some dirt, I think, got into the mold.

01:32.499 --> 01:33.440
No, it isn't that one.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.261
There it is.

01:34.641 --> 01:34.962
There.

01:34.982 --> 01:36.904
You see that C up in there?

01:38.406 --> 01:40.068
You can make it like that if you want to.

01:40.108 --> 01:44.794
And there's another pea on this page, I think, and it shows the same thing.

01:45.567 --> 01:48.350
You can get it down close if you want to.

01:48.370 --> 01:53.496
If I can find this to show you that it's not unique.

01:53.676 --> 01:55.518
Yes, here it is, right there.

01:55.538 --> 01:55.618
See?

01:55.638 --> 01:56.519
They're both of them.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.223
They're both made from the same mold, you see.

02:00.243 --> 02:01.184
That is fascinating.

02:01.244 --> 02:07.952
And probably some dirt or sand or something got in the mold and it had been kicked around for a while in the floor.

02:07.972 --> 02:09.674
It's like a little thing there, yeah.

02:11.596 --> 02:13.498
There are two of them on the same page.

02:13.816 --> 02:16.802
You can't say that those are unique.

02:18.145 --> 02:20.730
It had to be in the mold, because they were two on the same page.

02:21.452 --> 02:25.079
Yes, I certainly think two pieces of type, each had that defect.

02:25.119 --> 02:27.264
It must have been in the frame at the same time.

02:28.667 --> 02:33.597
It's sort of interesting, I think.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.445
But this, we're trying to get a facsimile made of this.

02:38.665 --> 02:40.768
If I live long enough, maybe someday it'll come off.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.288
God knows.

02:41.348 --> 02:43.791
I was sweating about it for years.

02:44.171 --> 02:46.794
Or the difficulty, Paul having moved to Southern.

02:46.814 --> 02:50.337
Well, they're always having some difficulty, and Paul won't let anybody else do it.

02:50.718 --> 02:52.940
And so that's the trouble.

02:53.020 --> 02:54.862
And so that makes me kind of sore at times.

02:55.102 --> 03:01.729
You know, the facsimile part has been done by Marian Steiner, and the text is in typescript.

03:01.749 --> 03:06.013
It takes Paul and Hope and Janet a few minutes to get their act together.

03:06.871 --> 03:24.075
This is the most fragile book in the library.

03:24.195 --> 03:29.943
One time I got this one.

03:30.904 --> 03:33.128
And as we speak, I know that's a caxton over there.

03:33.168 --> 03:36.372
That's okay.

03:36.824 --> 03:38.446
The cast in are two.

03:38.466 --> 03:41.610
Well, there's about five, I think, or so.

03:44.494 --> 03:46.937
But this, I got this.

03:49.420 --> 03:58.030
Morgan has a Coptic fragment of acts.

03:58.391 --> 03:59.632
I saw it labeled one time.

04:00.614 --> 04:01.955
Mr. Kraus and I were looking at it.

04:01.975 --> 04:06.561
See, Mr. Morgan went through his hands, naturally, and they called it a complete fragment.

04:06.811 --> 04:10.374
And an oxymoron, isn't it?

04:10.734 --> 04:18.141
And a complete fragment, and it's about 15 chapters or thereabouts, I think, 15 or 15 chapters in a particular fragment.

04:18.161 --> 04:22.464
I said, Hans, how big does a fragment have to be in order to be complete?

04:22.905 --> 04:23.485
One atom?

04:23.505 --> 04:25.847
Does that make a complete fragment?

04:25.947 --> 04:28.469
And booksellers talk, booksellers talk.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.833
So I have it on a distinct authority on the complete fragment.

04:33.393 --> 04:36.396
This, however, is not a, as far as I know, is not a fragment.

04:36.899 --> 04:39.122
It is a complete Gospel of Matthew.

04:39.763 --> 04:43.208
We get nervous the minute he does this.

04:43.248 --> 04:44.630
I'm keeping my hands folded.

04:44.690 --> 04:55.144
This is about the fifth century in Coptic, but it is written in a script that's very like the big Greek codices of that time.

04:55.545 --> 05:02.495
We're describing something that's perhaps four or five inches wide by perhaps six inches, if it's six inches deep.

05:03.216 --> 05:06.400
I think it's more like four or five, yeah.

05:06.650 --> 05:12.718
And you can see the characters there look like, some of them look like Greek capital.

05:12.738 --> 05:13.519
I was going to say Greek.

05:14.961 --> 05:15.342
No, it isn't Greek.

05:15.362 --> 05:18.166
But there certainly is a resemblance.

05:18.186 --> 05:21.630
And a lot of the names are written the same as in Greek.

05:21.650 --> 05:22.652
Do you know any Greek at all?

05:23.994 --> 05:24.915
Not to read, no.

05:25.015 --> 05:25.335
All right.

05:25.916 --> 05:30.302
I'll get to the end of it if I can find that particular page without any explosions.

05:30.342 --> 05:31.524
I hope it will be all right.

05:31.544 --> 05:33.807
This is the most interesting page in the book.

05:33.827 --> 05:34.648
It's right here.

05:35.995 --> 05:36.315
There.

05:36.596 --> 05:36.956
See that?

05:36.976 --> 05:38.899
That's sort of a nice little sign.

05:38.919 --> 05:42.204
And this, now can you see that?

05:42.504 --> 05:43.606
Doesn't that look like an M?

05:45.088 --> 05:46.330
Can you see over my thumb there?

05:46.350 --> 05:47.471
Yes, it does.

05:47.511 --> 05:49.955
Can you imagine an M there, if you want to?

05:49.975 --> 05:55.803
And take my word for it, the letter next to it is an A, if you try hard.

05:55.903 --> 06:01.191
And then this circle with a line to it, that's a theta, which means TH.

06:01.872 --> 06:03.454
There's an A, I, O,

06:03.755 --> 06:10.602
And that C would be used as an S, so that means Matthias, or Matthew, you see.

06:10.622 --> 06:11.343
Matthew.

06:11.363 --> 06:16.649
And before that comes the word K-A-T-A, which is kata, which means according to Matthew.

06:16.669 --> 06:28.441
And this word up here is the word gospel, or evangelion, the evangel, where the word evangelist, all that stuff comes from.

06:29.022 --> 06:33.306
Evangelion, I-O-N, you can see there at the end.

06:33.539 --> 06:35.221
I should say, I suppose.

06:35.341 --> 06:53.062
The Yoda-Omicron knew that, and you see this capital capital, and then at the end it says, these last letters, beginning of this E, airene, which he's speaking about the hippies' greeting of peace.

06:53.703 --> 06:55.044
Airene means peace.

06:55.785 --> 06:59.029
You know, the word irene, and so on, comes from that.

06:59.049 --> 07:00.711
So there are pieces of greeting.

07:01.096 --> 07:07.706
So that is the title at the end.

07:07.746 --> 07:08.908
Can we date this at all?

07:09.008 --> 07:09.889
I said fifth century.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.532
Oh, you did say fifth century.

07:11.552 --> 07:11.712
Yeah.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.654
Gith century.

07:12.994 --> 07:13.815
Probably fifth century.

07:13.836 --> 07:16.139
Now, here comes the early version of the glory.

07:16.179 --> 07:17.661
This is Greek for change.

07:18.463 --> 07:27.897
And that's doxa, means glory, and highest, and it's a story.

07:28.670 --> 07:32.274
Oh, that's the abbreviation of God, and so on.

07:32.374 --> 07:39.741
And then there's peace, again, again, again, again, again.

07:39.801 --> 07:42.764
That's all Greek.

07:42.784 --> 07:44.586
Look at the remarkable wood condition of it.

07:44.606 --> 07:49.310
And it's an unusually early copy of the Gloria, and it has some stuff in it that's later dropped out.

07:50.151 --> 07:50.992
What happens here?

07:52.253 --> 07:56.938
Well, there's a mice, or whatever, I guess.

07:57.104 --> 08:07.994
And then here, when they were talking about doing various things, like glorifying, praising God, and so on, there was something supposed to be put in, this word, which means we sing hymns to thee.

08:09.976 --> 08:11.597
So they were musically as well.

08:11.837 --> 08:16.101
Now, has anyone else read this to the degree that you have?

08:16.541 --> 08:17.222
Much more than I have.

08:17.242 --> 08:20.385
Does this reflect all of your own research into it, I wonder?

08:20.405 --> 08:20.825
No, it's not.

08:20.865 --> 08:22.847
This was published in fact, similarly.

08:22.867 --> 08:25.069
Well, you didn't tell them the story about dropping it.

08:25.268 --> 08:26.209
No, I didn't.

08:26.229 --> 08:34.657
The facsimile came, and I was holding one hand, trying to open this page, and holding the facsimile in the other hand, and the whole thing exploded all over this place here, on the floor and everything else.

08:34.957 --> 08:43.285
And so I had to put the book back together again, me, gathering signs, things like that, you see.

08:43.946 --> 08:47.470
And fortunately, there was a facsimile Krauss had given us.

08:47.490 --> 08:48.631
He'd Xeroxed the whole thing.

08:48.831 --> 08:53.115
And I'd made notes on that.

08:53.264 --> 08:56.087
different signs meant about the gatherings.

08:56.807 --> 09:07.718
And when this fellow who did the facsimile, I mean the book that Bill refers to, came back, I said, would you please look at this and see if I went through it.

09:07.778 --> 09:09.179
I think you've done it all right.

09:09.239 --> 09:09.880
I think it's OK.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.761
What did you feel when that happened?

09:12.202 --> 09:13.343
I was not happy.

09:15.825 --> 09:16.906
Very unhappy.

09:17.046 --> 09:20.369
It's the worst disaster I think had ever happened to my knowledge.

09:20.830 --> 09:21.010
Oh, God.

09:21.580 --> 09:24.524
And that's an item that you purchased, is that right?

09:24.544 --> 09:24.945
Yeah.

09:25.025 --> 09:30.853
Am I hitting the right areas, Bill?

09:44.572 --> 09:45.354
Mm-hmm.

09:45.554 --> 09:47.977
Mm-hmm.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.402
How often do you come in here, sir?

09:52.242 --> 09:54.044
Well, several times a week.

09:54.204 --> 10:03.195
Ideally, every day at the moment, I'd classify for something else.

10:03.295 --> 10:06.660
Would you say this has been your major avocation?

10:06.880 --> 10:09.343
Maybe not even, it's more than an avocation.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.726
I mean, do you play golf?

10:11.746 --> 10:12.807
Do you go fishing?

10:13.568 --> 10:14.769
Do you walk?

10:14.789 --> 10:15.270
No, I don't play.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.813
I'm an ex-golfer.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.415
I like to walk.

10:19.796 --> 10:21.017
I'm just going to wait.

10:21.267 --> 10:23.110
Go ahead, Bill.

10:23.130 --> 10:25.193
Well, that's the one that's funny about this.

10:25.213 --> 10:28.077
It's a Chester D. Manuscript.

10:29.039 --> 10:33.125
And it's a...canons of the... Oh, it's going to be so wonderful.

10:33.145 --> 10:34.267
Yeah, this really is.

10:34.287 --> 10:36.670
Let's give an idea of the period.

10:36.790 --> 10:38.152
I forgot, what is it?

10:38.172 --> 10:38.994
I think it's 10th century.

10:39.014 --> 10:39.635
10th century.

10:40.616 --> 10:41.938
It's a 10th century manuscript.

10:42.018 --> 10:46.305
And it's a collection of church statues in the council.

10:46.325 --> 10:49.249
Apparently, you're bridging the minds of it.

10:50.663 --> 10:57.171
I mean, it's really a remarkable manuscript to have in a private collection.

10:57.192 --> 10:58.834
It's a nice Carolingian hand.

10:58.874 --> 10:59.935
That's the point.

11:01.998 --> 11:04.561
It shows that period.

11:04.902 --> 11:07.024
It's quite a large manuscript.

11:07.044 --> 11:11.510
I mean, large in the size of the format and the length of it, too.

11:12.231 --> 11:17.498
Carolingian manuscripts tend to be shorter, and this is quite remarkable.

11:19.756 --> 11:23.782
How good did you get in this book?

11:23.802 --> 11:24.803
It's actually three.

11:24.863 --> 11:28.087
It looks like four different kinds of ink, doesn't it?

11:28.107 --> 11:29.670
I think it's two different kinds of ink.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.652
I mean, I think those... Those two, definitely.

11:32.373 --> 11:32.494
Yeah.

11:32.514 --> 11:40.204
But that's just, I mean, the quill running out of ink and getting thinner, and then you can dip it in again and rework it.

11:40.925 --> 11:46.393
There may be, that may be a third kind there with those numbers.

11:48.956 --> 11:49.577
It's extraordinary.

11:52.949 --> 11:58.556
So that's about 1,100 years old?

11:58.596 --> 11:58.776
No.

11:59.237 --> 12:13.995
Yes, 1,100 years old.

12:23.830 --> 12:30.402
Can I help you with that?

12:35.090 --> 12:42.985
There's a case that my father had made in 1925, because this particular copy has a original binding, obviously.

12:43.005 --> 12:44.748
It's a very nice binding.

12:44.788 --> 12:46.952
So I think it would.

12:48.738 --> 12:51.742
This is what we call the 42-line Bible, is that right?

12:51.902 --> 12:52.543
Most of it.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.344
I mean, I first bought it.

12:55.086 --> 12:55.286
Yeah.

12:55.927 --> 13:04.618
And then you can see here, these are signs of the evangelists here, and in between them are the Beatles.

13:05.399 --> 13:08.363
You can see the hippies with their guitars.

13:09.745 --> 13:10.265
I don't know what you say.

13:10.305 --> 13:11.347
What are you talking about?

13:11.367 --> 13:12.148
Can't you see them there?

13:13.970 --> 13:18.576
I don't know, which is Jonathan, which is this regal star, or so on about it.

13:18.927 --> 13:22.512
I'm actually touching a Gutenberg Bible.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.974
The original binding, yeah.

13:24.214 --> 13:28.120
The original binding of a Gutenberg Bible.

13:28.180 --> 13:31.465
Did they lock it, do you think?

13:31.665 --> 13:38.695
Well, those things were put on there to keep the—it was supposed to lie flat, and it was to keep the splitters in the wood from gouging the leather.

13:40.577 --> 13:42.420
Pigskin on a board.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.321
In the original.

13:45.762 --> 13:46.162
In the original.

13:46.202 --> 13:49.105
How many survive in the original bindings, I wonder?

13:49.125 --> 13:49.846
Not very many.

13:49.906 --> 13:52.768
I don't ... a dozen.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.570
I wouldn't think it'd be a dozen.

13:54.590 --> 13:55.090
No, not too many.

13:55.271 --> 13:56.572
This is a nice bindings.

13:56.592 --> 13:57.493
This is the Eaton copies.

13:58.093 --> 13:59.054
College copies.

13:59.074 --> 14:01.416
It's almost similar.

14:01.437 --> 14:03.158
This is the second copy to come to this country.

14:04.199 --> 14:04.499
Really?

14:04.720 --> 14:08.423
Oh, you have the original bill for it.

14:08.884 --> 14:09.304
Really?

14:09.324 --> 14:13.588
Well, what did ... It should be right in here, shouldn't it, Bill?

14:13.940 --> 14:19.468
Is it this is in two volumes, right?

14:21.531 --> 14:21.631
Yeah.

14:23.113 --> 14:26.518
Is the other binding identical to this?

14:26.538 --> 14:28.941
Yeah.

14:28.961 --> 14:41.018
It's essentially identical.

14:41.699 --> 14:43.542
So you get pretty good sized margins, you see.

14:44.348 --> 14:46.371
with the original binding.

14:46.831 --> 14:48.053
God, that's extraordinary.

14:48.073 --> 14:49.555
I mean, it's not foxed at all.

14:49.595 --> 14:51.778
There's no... No, no, there's no foxing in this copy.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.562
I can tell you that.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.943
Now, let's see.

14:56.744 --> 15:06.858
If you, um, and you see, nobody has, um, put the red lines through there at all.

15:07.379 --> 15:08.500
The original

15:09.678 --> 15:10.319
This is the original book.

15:10.339 --> 15:18.708
That's written in the hand of writing Henry Stevens, you know, the book dealer in the Henry Stevens of Vermont, the book dealer.

15:18.728 --> 15:19.709
My God, 1873.

15:19.749 --> 15:21.731
Yeah, he writes George Brindley.

15:21.831 --> 15:24.574
Square, London, February 10th, 1873.

15:24.774 --> 15:29.279
Yeah, he's sending his, he's telling George Brindley he's sending this over.

15:29.299 --> 15:33.223
Henry Stevens, it's called the Mazarine Revival.

15:33.243 --> 15:36.147
Yeah, this is a very famous, you should read that.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.508
Pray, ponder for a moment.

15:37.893 --> 15:46.761
Pray, ponder for a moment to fully appreciate the clarity and importance.

15:47.042 --> 15:48.063
I think it's clarity.

15:48.143 --> 15:48.523
Rarity.

15:48.703 --> 15:51.045
Rarity.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.847
Rarity and importance.

15:53.027 --> 15:53.748
That'll help you.

15:53.868 --> 15:55.049
Do you have a Xerox of this?

15:55.069 --> 15:55.610
I can make it.

15:55.630 --> 15:56.110
Would you?

15:56.571 --> 15:58.433
Well, you'd like a Xerox of that, I suppose.

15:58.453 --> 15:59.373
Would you do that for me?

16:00.274 --> 16:00.795
You'd do that?

16:04.098 --> 16:04.238
Mm-hmm.

16:04.420 --> 16:07.043
I should go down to Princeton more often.

16:07.063 --> 16:07.803
This is wonderful.

16:07.843 --> 16:12.488
Now, what is happening?

16:12.648 --> 16:13.609
Oh, that's on the other page.

16:13.689 --> 16:14.130
OK.

16:14.230 --> 16:15.391
Oh, my god.

16:15.411 --> 16:16.832
That's the beginning of a book.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.155
I see it's all over the manuscript there.

16:19.715 --> 16:23.759
Now, they hired people that came in the studios, the shop, to do that, right?

16:23.779 --> 16:24.120
That's right.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.962
We'll get into that a little bit more here.

16:26.842 --> 16:28.864
This is what numery and numbers you have.

16:29.345 --> 16:34.410
All right, now, but the fellow that was doing

16:35.808 --> 16:41.216
It was supposed to put red lines with the capital letters.

16:41.416 --> 16:44.380
It wasn't doing anything about it, you see.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.283
None of them—he hasn't done art.

16:46.523 --> 16:47.885
What's that in there coming through?

16:48.086 --> 16:50.569
Is that the— Well, now that's the middle of a gathering.

16:51.791 --> 16:52.752
And if you— I see it.

16:52.973 --> 16:54.855
You see the sewing there?

16:54.875 --> 16:55.156
I see it.

16:55.176 --> 16:55.356
I see it.

16:55.376 --> 16:56.357
Wait a minute.

16:56.377 --> 16:58.160
You see down there?

16:58.440 --> 16:59.762
There are threads down there.

16:59.862 --> 17:00.223
I see it.

17:00.363 --> 17:01.425
The string going through there.

17:01.705 --> 17:03.047
And so they put this bellum in there.

17:03.348 --> 17:07.153
to protect the, so the thread, the string won't cut the paper.

17:08.655 --> 17:09.076
Spectacular.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.359
And in the middle of every gathering, that is the case.

17:12.680 --> 17:19.229
Um, and so I'll go along here with, um... This is a rare moment for me, Mr. Scheide.

17:19.790 --> 17:29.282
I mean, I will always remember being in this room with you as we, as we together go through the Gutenberg Biro.

17:29.302 --> 17:32.747
I mean, this is, uh, this is my common experience.

17:33.284 --> 17:35.628
Well, you can have that at Harvard.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.892
No, I don't think it's a very common book.

17:38.412 --> 17:44.122
Well, that's—but if you're Mr. Krause and have a copy, before you sell it, you call and say you'll have the book of books.

17:44.603 --> 17:46.366
Wow.

17:46.386 --> 17:46.766
Anyway.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.409
Just a few look at that.

17:49.010 --> 17:51.274
Now, here's Joshua.

17:51.494 --> 17:52.015
Oh, boy.

17:52.676 --> 17:55.460
Yes, all right.

17:57.684 --> 17:58.846
And still, there's no money.

17:58.926 --> 18:00.068
Now, this fellow—

18:00.925 --> 18:17.462
There are some pages that do have this in another middle of the gathering, that have the red lines with the capital letters, enable us to tell something about the private life of the artist.

18:17.482 --> 18:20.705
In other words, who his girlfriend was.

18:20.725 --> 18:28.553
I don't know if she had red hair, but I'll show you a little bit.

18:29.377 --> 18:31.479
There's Priscilla and Joshua, I believe, yes.

18:32.781 --> 18:33.561
And here's Judges.

18:33.581 --> 18:35.283
Now, Judges starts over here.

18:36.985 --> 18:37.265
Yes.

18:38.747 --> 18:45.013
The designer, they had double indentation there for this P, so you have to make the P fit into that.

18:45.113 --> 18:46.535
Do these pages compare?

18:46.775 --> 18:49.178
Are they basically identical to the other Bibles?

18:49.738 --> 18:53.943
I mean, would the other Bible pretty much have the same kind of design on this page?

18:53.963 --> 18:55.264
Oh, well, I have a facsimile.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.105
You can show it.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.067
Do I see the facsimile?

18:59.448 --> 19:04.893
So they did pretty much follow a script, in other words.

19:06.114 --> 19:08.757
I mean, the artist did.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.619
Oh, no, no, no, the illumination.

19:10.719 --> 19:12.601
Oh, no, the illumination is different very much.

19:12.621 --> 19:14.282
That's really what I was curious about, the illumination.

19:14.302 --> 19:18.847
Well, you can see what the beginning of Judges is in this book.

19:19.187 --> 19:20.468
I thought you meant the invitation.

19:20.488 --> 19:21.890
Oh, no, of course, the print is print.

19:21.910 --> 19:26.234
Yeah, that would tend to be the same, but ... Joshua?

19:26.734 --> 19:28.476
I was wondering if the artist really ...

19:28.844 --> 19:30.646
If they improvised from one to the other.

19:31.267 --> 19:32.509
Well, he probably did his own job.

19:33.730 --> 19:37.956
Chapter six, we're getting closer.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.357
Well, that's Joshua now.

19:39.377 --> 19:40.399
Very nice, though.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.201
Thank you.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.463
Here you really are.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.265
See, that is the same business.

19:45.365 --> 19:47.768
See how different it is?

19:47.788 --> 19:47.988
It is.

19:48.108 --> 19:50.151
It's dramatically different, isn't it?

19:50.171 --> 19:50.952
Of course, yes.

19:50.972 --> 19:51.653
It's a different artist.

19:52.714 --> 19:55.418
So you just had to fill that place there.

19:56.079 --> 19:58.041
That's all you were doing with a P in there.

19:58.628 --> 20:06.118
Who do you think – do you think they were selling the artists as much as they were selling the – See, they're the Beatles again.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.300
Where did you get this Beatles?

20:07.720 --> 20:13.228
Well, you see these guys, these sloppy-looking, hippy types, with these guitars or lutes, as they are.

20:13.248 --> 20:15.931
Do you see them there?

20:15.952 --> 20:16.492
Oh, of course.

20:16.652 --> 20:17.373
All right.

20:17.454 --> 20:18.475
We're talking about minstrels.

20:18.495 --> 20:19.376
Minstrels, right.

20:19.757 --> 20:21.920
All right, the corn.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.063
But what do you want?

20:24.083 --> 20:27.387
Especially 20 or 30 years ago when I first started it.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.943
They're doing quite well.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.767
And a friend of mine said, when will the Beattles come to Seedles?

20:34.827 --> 20:35.628
Beattles, that's right.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.269
No, to Seedles.

20:36.329 --> 20:37.250
To Seedles, right.

20:37.270 --> 20:45.199
When will the Beattles come to Seedles?

20:45.219 --> 20:47.642
This is the only Gutenberg Bible in private hands, I think.

20:47.662 --> 20:49.424
Is that right?

20:49.444 --> 20:51.947
I would say so, yes.

20:51.967 --> 20:56.732
Now, I don't know the Bible well enough to know what comes after the judges.

20:57.151 --> 20:59.514
But you may notice a change here in a minute.

20:59.534 --> 21:00.075
Look at that.

21:00.095 --> 21:00.435
See that?

21:03.780 --> 21:05.282
So all of a sudden it's become red.

21:05.743 --> 21:06.544
Oh, red, yeah.

21:06.564 --> 21:09.648
That's like what you were showing me in the... You see all the redness there?

21:10.349 --> 21:10.489
Uh-huh.

21:10.509 --> 21:11.570
Now, what book do you suppose that is?

21:12.031 --> 21:14.815
Can you read it across the top or not?

21:14.835 --> 21:15.175
I don't know.

21:16.998 --> 21:18.259
Can you read it?

21:18.279 --> 21:19.621
There it is all by itself.

21:19.641 --> 21:20.643
It's there also.

21:20.743 --> 21:21.804
That's a very legible.

21:21.824 --> 21:22.425
Can you read it there?

21:24.227 --> 21:25.369
Incipit of Lieber...

21:26.885 --> 21:27.846
I'm going to let you do it.

21:28.547 --> 21:29.348
I want to hear you do it.

21:29.368 --> 21:30.209
Do you see what that letter is?

21:31.751 --> 21:38.238
Well, it looks like an R, but it's, uh... Yeah, no, I... It was... Ruth.

21:38.258 --> 21:38.718
There's his girlfriend.

21:38.738 --> 21:40.280
She comes to life all of it in a hurry.

21:40.821 --> 21:41.001
Oh.

21:41.922 --> 21:44.044
Well, he wasn't doing a damn thing over there in Judges.

21:44.105 --> 21:46.247
He didn't care anything about that.

21:46.267 --> 21:47.168
He threw him out of court.

21:47.608 --> 21:49.971
But Ruth runs to her.

21:49.991 --> 21:51.373
It was red all over the place.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.734
Isn't that funny?

21:52.754 --> 21:55.137
And at the end, the Ruth stops again.

21:56.990 --> 22:00.253
Does this happen with all the ... all the ... No, just this copy.

22:00.273 --> 22:02.435
Just this one copy.

22:02.455 --> 22:08.601
But he does this and works somewhere else in the book, but there never was such a dramatic way as that spot.

22:08.621 --> 22:13.626
So that's ... You really think that it's ... Well, I put a Freudian interpretation on it.

22:13.646 --> 22:13.806
Why not?

22:13.826 --> 22:14.486
But I wonder why.

22:14.506 --> 22:15.147
I wonder why.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.610
Maybe he was trying for a different effect.

22:18.650 --> 22:20.872
Why did he pick that book?

22:21.013 --> 22:26.878
It's a short book, but there's a rather short book there, the second volume in particular.

22:26.977 --> 22:29.079
It may well be the shortest book in this volume.

22:29.439 --> 22:31.501
Why were some of these on paper and some on vellum?

22:31.781 --> 22:32.622
Were the vellum ones?

22:32.922 --> 22:34.444
More expensive.

22:34.724 --> 22:38.347
So they actually went through this 500-odd years ago, too.

22:38.607 --> 22:49.697
Well, most manuscripts have been written on vellum, and if they're selling them to an archbishop or some big shot like that who's used to having vellum manuscripts, he would think this is a step down.

22:50.438 --> 22:53.080
He wouldn't be interested.

22:53.100 --> 22:56.663
Now, this is a very—quite aside from this.

22:57.318 --> 23:01.766
The attachment of this saw is Ruth.

23:01.786 --> 23:05.592
This is, in some respects, the most interesting page in this copy.

23:06.413 --> 23:10.180
Now, if you look on— Oh, Pauloulos, we're looking at it.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.167
Well, if you look up there, this is manuscript, see?

23:14.507 --> 23:15.769
Explicit liber Ruth.

23:15.950 --> 23:16.451
Okay.

23:17.212 --> 23:19.556
Over here, that's written by somebody.

23:20.638 --> 23:22.060
This is red print.

23:22.613 --> 23:25.197
Insipid prologus and lebrose regulus.

23:25.217 --> 23:26.920
Don't pen the page.

23:26.940 --> 23:30.586
I don't want to pen the page.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.829
The prologue begins in the Book of Kings.

23:33.971 --> 23:49.937
Now, if you look at these two pages very carefully, you may want to come closer if you want to, that there is a little bit, see if you agree with me, this is my assertion,

23:50.474 --> 23:53.598
There's a little more space between these lines and these lines.

23:53.818 --> 23:54.960
They're slightly more crowded.

23:55.981 --> 23:59.126
Can you imagine the truth in that statement or not?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.068
I don't see it myself.

24:01.088 --> 24:01.749
Do you see it, Bill?

24:02.350 --> 24:09.940
Yeah, these are the space between the lines there, between the tops of the ascenders there.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.225
Definitely there, I think.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.908
It looks kind of deeper there, no?

24:16.389 --> 24:16.549
Yeah.

24:16.569 --> 24:17.390
There's a little more space.

24:17.410 --> 24:18.051
Now, if you...

24:18.419 --> 24:26.288
If you count these, you're supposed to get forty-two lines.

24:26.609 --> 24:28.451
If you count these, you're supposed to get forty lines.

24:30.453 --> 24:31.675
But they're the same length, you see.

24:31.695 --> 24:33.717
The columns are the same length.

24:34.698 --> 24:41.146
So, if what I say is right, and I think it is right, there's more space here to the two lines.

24:41.686 --> 24:46.452
Now, to come down to more particulars, take

24:47.579 --> 24:49.641
I want to find a cue over here, for example.

24:49.661 --> 24:51.684
Well, in other words, they cut out two lines.

24:52.004 --> 24:53.646
No, they didn't cut them out.

24:53.806 --> 24:56.689
Well, they didn't cut out, but they spread it out.

24:56.749 --> 24:58.652
They put some leading in there.

24:58.692 --> 25:02.736
Now, I want to find a cue over here, or a queen.

25:03.657 --> 25:04.979
Is there any cue in this pile?

25:04.999 --> 25:07.161
But you'll have to come over and look at it.

25:07.181 --> 25:09.504
Look, there's a cue.

25:10.765 --> 25:11.406
Now, take this cue.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.769
Do you see spikes coming out of the top?

25:14.750 --> 25:14.970
Yes.

25:15.372 --> 25:16.313
How about over there?

25:16.333 --> 25:17.174
Do you see a spike there?

25:17.194 --> 25:17.996
I don't see a spike there.

25:18.016 --> 25:18.176
No.

25:18.516 --> 25:19.638
It's been filed off.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.603
Just for that one line of type, probably.

25:24.705 --> 25:26.587
Well, from all the type.

25:27.148 --> 25:29.731
I'll take, let's see, where's the P here?

25:29.852 --> 25:32.996
I mean, just for that one instance, wouldn't you say?

25:33.416 --> 25:35.119
No, that's where you can see it.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.723
All the type, but in other cases it isn't so clear.

25:39.244 --> 25:42.489
I'm looking for, there's got to be a P over here somewhere.

25:43.650 --> 25:45.092
I know there is, because I've

25:45.933 --> 25:47.355
There's one right there.

25:47.375 --> 25:52.260
A capital P. Yeah, there's Poro, that's it.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.002
See the spike up there?

25:54.583 --> 25:55.303
There's many there.

25:57.145 --> 25:58.987
File down.

25:59.007 --> 26:04.854
Or the other one there on Octavis, but Obed is much smoother.

26:05.475 --> 26:10.961
Can you see how this O in Obed is smoother than the O in Octavis?

26:10.981 --> 26:13.563
I'm just trying to, I'm looking at this to see if it's on line, and it is.

26:13.603 --> 26:15.906
They are both on the same line.

26:16.443 --> 26:24.135
And so this has been thought to have been the original form of the type.

26:25.437 --> 26:29.163
And this was the second press.

26:29.183 --> 26:34.211
So he set up a second press to begin at this point.

26:34.231 --> 26:44.847
And they printed for a while with this forty-line format, and then somebody said,

26:45.907 --> 26:47.048
This is wasting.

26:47.068 --> 26:48.730
You've got to get more type on a page.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.133
Well, they tried hard, and they got two more lines on.

26:52.054 --> 26:56.118
And by filing all the type, I'm going into a lot of trouble.

26:57.079 --> 26:58.501
I'm just going to count the lines.

26:59.942 --> 27:00.343
I can't.

27:02.265 --> 27:05.248
You take the dull end of your pencil and you can.

27:06.830 --> 27:07.831
I hesitate to do that.

27:08.031 --> 27:08.752
All right.

27:08.772 --> 27:14.698
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.

27:14.948 --> 27:26.806
14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36.

27:28.148 --> 27:31.133
You're kind of only one, aren't you?

27:32.415 --> 27:38.845
At the end there, I think.

27:38.865 --> 27:43.352
2, 4, 6, 10, 2, 6, 8, 20, 2, 4, 6, 8, 30, 2, 1, 6, 8,

27:43.889 --> 27:44.650
It's about 40.

27:44.910 --> 27:46.572
That's 40, yeah.

27:46.592 --> 27:47.934
And so they added two more lines.

27:47.994 --> 27:49.115
Yes, they added two more.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.619
And this is how they were doing it, by filing out the top cells, as you can see.

27:52.979 --> 27:53.560
I get it now.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.722
And there you can see them both.

27:56.103 --> 28:00.267
But why is it the beginning, then, is not really the beginning of the book?

28:00.427 --> 28:02.370
Well, yes, I haven't quite finished my story.

28:02.970 --> 28:07.455
And this is the second press.

28:07.475 --> 28:13.542
Now, then it got a little further along, and they said, oh, we're getting a lot more orders.

28:14.028 --> 28:15.951
You've got to print more copies.

28:15.971 --> 28:18.074
And they go, what about the pages that were already printed?

28:18.154 --> 28:19.396
Well, you have to do them over again.

28:19.657 --> 28:20.238
Oh, boy.

28:20.398 --> 28:27.629
So there are two versions of any page that occurs in 40 lines is another version in 42 lines.

28:29.012 --> 28:31.315
And so they had to do that.

28:31.676 --> 28:37.605
Then all these things lay around the print shop, and were all put together this way and that.

28:37.940 --> 28:39.421
pure chance how things work out.

28:39.782 --> 28:44.987
In this particular copy, we got the 40 lines in this section at the beginning of the 42 line.

28:45.247 --> 28:50.893
So that's why I showed you this with a particular project.

28:51.073 --> 28:55.237
My suspicion is that in this copy, this is the oldest page that was printed.

28:55.257 --> 28:57.959
But in any copy you look at, you'll get a mixture of them.

28:57.979 --> 29:01.182
And none of them, I imagine, are identical.

29:01.743 --> 29:03.665
So some have all the 40 lines.

29:05.006 --> 29:06.968
We have the earliest printing in every case.

29:07.066 --> 29:09.729
All we have here is putting in this case, but not in this case.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.312
Are there any proof sheets that survive?

29:11.712 --> 29:14.836
Yes, I think there's one in Bloomington, Indiana, speaking about that.

29:14.856 --> 29:20.664
So if you go to Bloomington, Indiana for any reason, why are you— Well, I'm going to go see John Cagle, as a matter of fact, at the Lilly Library.

29:20.704 --> 29:22.346
Yeah, well, he'll know it.

29:22.366 --> 29:23.047
He'll tell you about it.

29:23.407 --> 29:29.455
And I tried to get it, and Krauss had it almost, well, about in the 50s.

29:30.136 --> 29:36.364
And I wrote, and he's already sold it to Mr. George Cool, who sold his stuff to Indiana.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.625
And I said, well, I'm very disappointed.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.628
They said, well, it's too shy you haven't been buying books lately.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.853
I said, well, you knew I had a good work Bible, did you?

29:45.873 --> 29:48.056
And so I would have been glad to have it myself.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.481
But you see here, you see.

29:51.501 --> 29:55.086
Nothing angers you more when a dealer has something and doesn't tell you something.

29:55.286 --> 29:55.667
Yeah.

29:55.707 --> 29:56.368
See the pithole?

29:57.710 --> 29:57.810
Yeah.

29:57.830 --> 29:58.511
That's a good pithole.

29:58.611 --> 29:59.653
There's a good pithole there.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.115
There's a pithole on almost every page.

30:01.255 --> 30:02.116
Which indicate what?

30:02.597 --> 30:04.720
Well, it was pinned down in the press.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.182
See the pithole there?

30:07.445 --> 30:09.468
You can see there.

30:09.488 --> 30:12.712
That's a very clear pinhole.

30:12.732 --> 30:17.959
They pinned them right down in the press, so they wouldn't wiggle when the thing came down.

30:17.979 --> 30:20.883
I see.

30:20.903 --> 30:27.732
Where do you keep your Declaration of Independence that was in the news recently at the Bradley Martin sale?

30:27.752 --> 30:32.157
You have now the ... They actually named you in that catalog.

30:32.177 --> 30:33.579
I thought you'd be part of the collection.

30:33.619 --> 30:34.560
But that isn't unique.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.523
You see, that's another very common thing.

30:36.740 --> 30:41.424
I was trying to make the thing interesting for you.

30:42.025 --> 31:05.346
But now, as we go along here, all right, now get along to, um, yeah, so when I first came down here, we had to exhibit this thing, and I was trying to figure out, and of course, everybody builds this sort of stuff, and here's another 49 page, and some more of the red printing.

31:05.663 --> 31:10.531
But when they gave up the—they went to 42 lines, they also gave up red printing.

31:10.551 --> 31:14.177
This is the only red—this is the only red printing in this project.

31:14.197 --> 31:15.860
Is there any connection between that?

31:15.880 --> 31:16.922
Do you think there was just— I think so.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.444
It took too much time.

31:18.465 --> 31:19.266
It wastes too much time.

31:19.286 --> 31:20.889
You had to be re-inked and everything.

31:21.710 --> 31:25.056
And it's sort of— Now— Can I just feel this?

31:25.076 --> 31:26.598
I promise I won't .

31:26.618 --> 31:26.859
Wow.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.421
All right.

31:28.441 --> 31:31.266
Well, um— I can actually say I've touched it.

31:31.718 --> 31:37.604
But I was trying to get away from just that kind of thing, because the importance of that book is not that, but this.

31:38.145 --> 31:42.149
So I wanted to find pages where there wasn't anything else to distract anyone's attention.

31:43.591 --> 31:45.873
So I found one over here.

31:46.194 --> 31:46.794
I'll show you.

31:47.115 --> 31:49.257
Now that read, did you say that's manuscript?

31:49.297 --> 31:50.038
Oh, yes, of course.

31:50.118 --> 31:50.679
Absolutely.

31:51.179 --> 31:51.900
Just as much as that is.

31:51.980 --> 31:56.265
You see somebody's putting a C in there to tell the guy what letter's supposed to go there.

31:57.546 --> 32:01.050
And also at the top of the page, you've done the same, and once in a while you can see it.

32:01.537 --> 32:05.442
But now over here, here's one of those pages, see, where there's nothing except that.

32:05.602 --> 32:08.666
So now you've got me looking for pinholes, too, now that you can point it out.

32:08.686 --> 32:09.588
Yes, there's a pinhole.

32:09.708 --> 32:13.813
Well, I think there's a pinhole down there, maybe.

32:13.953 --> 32:15.195
There's that one there.

32:15.255 --> 32:16.757
That's a pinhole.

32:17.618 --> 32:20.062
Now, here you ought to be able to tell what this is about.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.745
Which column should we look in?

32:22.765 --> 32:25.409
We should look in there.

32:26.030 --> 32:26.470
Is that working?

32:27.411 --> 32:28.032
Goliath.

32:28.052 --> 32:29.434
Yeah, so there you see what it's about.

32:30.173 --> 32:32.776
Well, it's David and Goliath, of course.

32:32.836 --> 32:33.877
It must be David here.

32:33.917 --> 32:39.524
But I wonder why Goliath isn't a capital G. Did they capitalize Christian names?

32:39.744 --> 32:41.987
They didn't capitalize this name either, see?

32:42.568 --> 32:43.889
Is that a capital D?

32:44.710 --> 32:46.132
It doesn't look like it to me.

32:46.913 --> 32:50.076
Yeah, but that's the beginning of a sentence.

32:50.096 --> 32:50.897
That's true.

32:50.917 --> 32:51.758
The period?

32:52.439 --> 32:56.504
Yeah, see, Philistius didn't capitalize that either.

32:57.445 --> 32:58.206
Goliath, no money.

32:59.131 --> 33:00.092
So there we are.

33:00.132 --> 33:01.753
So we have long, see?

33:01.874 --> 33:05.177
And a small d for David.

33:08.039 --> 33:08.400
That's wonderful.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.021
That's the first edition of that story.

33:12.523 --> 33:13.584
All right, I'll go on.

33:13.604 --> 33:14.745
And you see, nothing but type.

33:15.426 --> 33:20.691
That's what you're supposed to see.

33:20.751 --> 33:27.197
Now, one of the funny things about this book, I enjoy their hyphens very much.

33:28.342 --> 33:45.306
and the margins are wonderful, I have yet to find a bottom line at the end of a second column that has any hyphenated words never go from page to page.

33:45.326 --> 33:46.067
Which makes sense.

33:46.327 --> 33:48.370
Or column to column.

33:48.390 --> 33:49.772
And how they avoid that is wonderful.

33:49.872 --> 33:50.873
I don't know, but they do.

33:51.795 --> 33:57.943
It's very easy to do, because when you're sitting looking down at a big book like this, or it's easier to look at the bottom line anywhere else,

33:58.295 --> 34:00.217
They're perfectly justified, aren't they?

34:00.398 --> 34:01.239
Oh, yeah.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.702
This is what I call the first team.

34:04.262 --> 34:08.167
And after, all those guys would say, what's going to happen?

34:08.187 --> 34:09.088
This is a success.

34:09.188 --> 34:10.289
Boy, am I getting out here.

34:10.309 --> 34:13.393
Instead of a bone shop, I'm not going to work for these pittance of wages.

34:13.453 --> 34:15.496
I'm going to business myself.

34:15.576 --> 34:17.098
See, I'll get the profits.

34:17.158 --> 34:19.681
So that's what happened.

34:19.881 --> 34:27.390
And right after this, then the survivors had to pick up new apprentices and start over again.

34:28.585 --> 34:35.032
Now, let me see, we want, we want, I think we want third king, if I'm not mistaken.

34:36.874 --> 34:41.980
But now we'll take it, I will, I will, look at this now.

34:42.121 --> 34:42.901
That's extraordinary.

34:42.921 --> 34:46.145
Now, here we sent a, used this on a Christmas card one time.

34:47.447 --> 34:48.268
You did?

34:48.348 --> 34:51.972
Because this is found on playing cards.

34:52.593 --> 34:54.174
We're looking, what kind of an animal is that?

34:54.515 --> 34:54.835
A bear.

34:54.855 --> 34:55.656
Yes, it is a bear.

34:55.855 --> 34:59.179
I had a long bus climbing like a vine.

35:03.924 --> 35:06.326
It's extraordinary how he knows this.

35:07.307 --> 35:07.668
Watch him.

35:07.888 --> 35:20.802
When we first got the team down here, Lehmann Hough, his father, Brittenberger, the master of the playing card, and he saw this thing, and he was very much interested.

35:20.822 --> 35:22.504
He was very excited.

35:23.142 --> 35:27.707
Well, there's a picture of it.

35:27.847 --> 35:31.630
And here is the nine of wild animals.

35:32.431 --> 35:32.611
See?

35:33.032 --> 35:34.253
On the playing card.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.315
It's a bit of kick-massy now, I think.

35:37.036 --> 35:40.840
Well, anyway, we've... It's precisely the same illustration.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.221
But there he's unmotivated.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.823
He goes, well, why are you in that position?

35:43.883 --> 35:44.804
Here you can understand it.

35:46.585 --> 35:49.809
Well, they illustrate a little bit here.

35:49.829 --> 35:51.310
Well, yes.

35:52.167 --> 35:53.168
That's another book.

35:53.448 --> 35:57.453
I don't think that's a playing card.

35:57.473 --> 35:58.213
I don't know what it is.

35:58.233 --> 36:07.103
It gives you the idea of what he's doing there, as opposed to just... But then the playing card, it makes no sense.

36:07.843 --> 36:21.718
So I used this photograph over here, about 1962, as I remember, as a Christmas card.

36:23.150 --> 36:26.675
Will the bear make it to the top?

36:26.695 --> 36:28.157
Did the master of the playing cards make it?

36:28.518 --> 36:29.519
Did Gutenberg make it?

36:29.960 --> 36:32.023
Our prayer for the new year is, may we all make it.

36:32.183 --> 36:37.170
The bear is sort of wondering if he's going to make it.

36:37.190 --> 36:45.722
And this sentence here says, something rather, the Lord was good and the plague was averted from Israel.

36:46.083 --> 36:48.787
And that was just after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

36:48.867 --> 36:50.389
So I thought that was not bad.

36:50.757 --> 36:53.100
Yeah, certainly.

36:53.140 --> 36:56.024
Whether or not the bear makes it to the top.

36:56.485 --> 37:02.433
Now, there's a number of these playing card things show up in this book, beginning at this point.

37:02.453 --> 37:09.002
And the suit of flowers, the playing card, these are from playing cards, and the birds also.

37:09.042 --> 37:12.206
And so it'll go on from this time and enjoy.

37:13.047 --> 37:13.949
They drew these from?

37:14.009 --> 37:15.811
Model books.

37:15.831 --> 37:16.412
I see.

37:16.432 --> 37:17.954
They follow, who would get this?

37:18.034 --> 37:19.296
Must have been lucky to model.

37:19.732 --> 37:23.157
very similar to this fellow that has his playing cards.

37:24.239 --> 37:29.187
And the playing cards are done by some sort of print business, impression.

37:29.207 --> 37:30.389
This is not as drawn.

37:30.409 --> 37:31.511
Like a stamp, maybe.

37:31.551 --> 37:32.552
Yeah, some sort of stamp.

37:33.414 --> 37:36.939
As I noticed, when I looked at it, the Bibliotec Nationale.

37:36.959 --> 37:39.423
And so we'll go to four.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.048
Four kings.

37:43.229 --> 37:46.214
Here is, and here you see, there's a stork.

37:46.234 --> 37:47.376
That's a playing card.

37:47.677 --> 37:49.700
He gets excited about the stork also.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.104
Here's one of these little tabs.

37:53.124 --> 37:54.626
It would have gone right there, I suppose.

37:55.868 --> 37:58.050
It doesn't know where this book was.

37:59.092 --> 38:01.395
This is travel, the book, for all these hundreds of years.

38:01.415 --> 38:01.755
That's right.

38:01.996 --> 38:03.097
Five hundred and some years.

38:04.519 --> 38:05.280
Smile-boggling.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.423
They took really good care of these, didn't they?

38:08.284 --> 38:08.384
Yeah.

38:08.404 --> 38:11.608
This paper is a wonderful rag paper.

38:12.331 --> 38:17.537
I haven't seen a single instance of any suggestion of proxy.

38:17.557 --> 38:20.940
Of course, it doesn't happen 100% in Iraq anyway, does it?

38:20.960 --> 38:22.482
Not so likely, not so likely.

38:23.063 --> 38:32.733
Now we get to Chronicles, see the little green man shooting the deer?

38:32.753 --> 38:37.478
It's the pull of the Chronicles at the end of

38:39.027 --> 38:41.050
I wonder why they left that blank.

38:41.270 --> 38:42.351
No, at the end of the book.

38:42.371 --> 38:43.933
They wanted us to make a big deal with it.

38:43.953 --> 38:45.816
That's why they didn't put a picture down there or something.

38:45.836 --> 38:48.499
I don't have any pictures.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.223
There's the scribe.

38:51.243 --> 38:52.905
Yes, that's exactly what I was talking about.

38:53.005 --> 38:54.127
That's a good example of that.

38:54.147 --> 38:56.250
You see, he wrote up there what this guy was supposed to write.

38:56.830 --> 38:57.872
And there it is.

38:58.112 --> 39:00.255
And then it's supposed to be trimmed off from the binder.

39:00.275 --> 39:04.581
The same way the holes are supposed to be trimmed off from the pinhole.

39:04.601 --> 39:05.382
See, there you can keep it and keep it.

39:05.402 --> 39:07.144
That's the only one I've ever done.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.629
Yeah, that's a good one, yeah.

39:08.850 --> 39:10.912
Every once in a while, one of those will show up.

39:10.932 --> 39:11.673
And there's this owl.

39:11.713 --> 39:15.558
That's also a playing card item.

39:15.578 --> 39:19.223
And you see, there's a little gathering, of course.

39:20.865 --> 39:23.368
And now we'll go along here to end it.

39:23.388 --> 39:25.090
Well, that's a beautiful chronicle.

39:25.110 --> 39:27.393
What is the Second Chronicles?

39:27.413 --> 39:28.214
Coming up with Chronicles.

39:28.234 --> 39:29.155
Second Chronicles is a good one.

39:29.495 --> 39:30.937
I always had this out for the class.

39:31.438 --> 39:33.620
I call it, this gets us in the Ivy League.

39:33.781 --> 39:34.161
This is the

39:34.529 --> 39:36.291
the Dartmouth-Columbia game.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.198
That's cute.

39:41.218 --> 39:42.299
Big Green and the Lions.

39:42.340 --> 39:44.022
Yeah, that's right.

39:44.502 --> 39:45.203
Big Green and the Lions.

39:45.704 --> 39:48.207
No Tigers, unfortunately.

39:48.227 --> 39:49.009
No Tigers.

39:49.029 --> 39:50.290
We have enough Tigers at Princeton.

39:50.310 --> 39:51.932
Thank you very much.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.175
Is Big Green part of the series?

39:54.195 --> 39:58.341
Is the hunter with the bow and the man with the club, is that part of a playing card?

39:58.401 --> 39:58.962
Oh, yes.

39:58.982 --> 40:01.485
There's a wild man suit.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.249
And, of course, the lion is right there, right

40:05.174 --> 40:06.075
There, see?

40:06.095 --> 40:07.396
It's the exact same line.

40:07.936 --> 40:10.058
Well, it's fairly similar.

40:10.078 --> 40:15.082
Oh, God, look at the ... It suggests it, shall we say.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.784
It's more than it suggests it.

40:16.804 --> 40:18.045
Yes, I think so.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.906
And the flowers also.

40:20.487 --> 40:23.570
So I always have that page out when that class comes in.

40:23.590 --> 40:24.751
Now, what class is this?

40:25.311 --> 40:26.572
Well, 36.

40:26.872 --> 40:28.454
We'll have a reunion next year.

40:30.756 --> 40:32.017
Oh, your classes.

40:32.077 --> 40:34.759
Yeah, my college class.

40:35.077 --> 40:38.060
I thought you meant you were teaching a class.

40:38.100 --> 40:43.566
No, no, college class.

40:43.586 --> 40:44.587
There's a few more.

40:44.627 --> 40:50.293
The nicest thing about these things is they occur right in the middle third of the book.

40:50.513 --> 40:55.978
It's best to open it.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.307
See, now there's another bear.

41:04.625 --> 41:07.089
He said the crawling bear.

41:08.290 --> 41:13.458
The crawling bear, he's, um, there he is.

41:13.618 --> 41:16.001
He came up up there.

41:16.562 --> 41:16.702
Mm-hmm.

41:16.722 --> 41:17.263
Oh, yeah.

41:17.283 --> 41:19.246
That's all.

41:19.266 --> 41:21.088
And the bird.

41:21.389 --> 41:24.193
Well, he's out of stuff, so we used the, uh... Oh, yeah.

41:24.213 --> 41:29.480
It was this blackhead, wasn't he, by the... Well, he was using the model.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.725
And there's something bad down there.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.504
That's the first thing I've seen.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.731
I'd have to say this is a remarkably fine copy, isn't it?

41:40.751 --> 41:41.612
It's a nice copy.

41:42.294 --> 41:44.096
Then finally, is this?

41:44.116 --> 41:45.358
Yeah, that's right.

41:45.859 --> 41:47.602
And then this is the third bear.

41:51.869 --> 41:55.354
The hibernating bear was always stuck in his toe or something.

41:55.570 --> 41:57.332
Are these cards, like, with 52?

41:58.053 --> 42:00.517
I mean, is there a traditional deck of playing cards now?

42:00.537 --> 42:08.487
No, no, but I mean, they certainly were used by a number of, in manuscripts and manuscripts all over the place.

42:08.507 --> 42:10.630
No, this is just two, and there's three.

42:10.650 --> 42:14.275
Now, I think, pretty soon now, this is going to disappear.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.618
The model book will have been withdrawn.

42:16.778 --> 42:18.000
Yeah, so I think it's gone now.

42:18.335 --> 42:19.216
Well, it's a bird.

42:19.737 --> 42:20.637
Yeah, it's a bird, yes.

42:20.718 --> 42:23.601
Is this the same artist throughout, or do you think this is a team of artists?

42:23.661 --> 42:24.802
Are these different artists?

42:24.822 --> 42:27.685
I think it's pretty much the same in this volume, anyway.

42:29.267 --> 42:34.793
Yeah, this is one of the pages that Paul Edom gets so interested in, because there's a lot of numbers, and they write them all out.

42:36.074 --> 42:38.116
And they don't abbreviate this equal.

42:38.136 --> 42:39.858
Well, it's slightly abbreviated.

42:39.878 --> 42:48.207
Queen Quaginta Septem and Centum Quadrigim Quaginta Duo 142.

42:48.743 --> 43:01.280
Look at this one, and yet they still don't have any hyphen at the bottom line, you see.

43:01.300 --> 43:04.124
They must have actually pointed for that from the top of the column.

43:04.345 --> 43:05.426
You'd have to have a word for it.

43:06.327 --> 43:08.571
Yeah, no, no, no, no, Templum Dei, that's it.

43:09.011 --> 43:11.314
Look, they have two hyphenated words right there.

43:11.515 --> 43:11.815
Yeah, yeah.

43:12.250 --> 43:15.114
And yet they set the thing up so they couldn't do it.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.397
Is it hyphenated in the next to the bottom line?

43:17.878 --> 43:20.461
Look, there's one, two, and there are four of them.

43:20.481 --> 43:21.883
Well, that's the final seven lines.

43:22.604 --> 43:24.607
Amazing.

43:24.627 --> 43:26.669
You see, that's a different fellow.

43:26.689 --> 43:27.571
That's a different style.

43:27.651 --> 43:28.792
I would say, yeah.

43:28.812 --> 43:32.637
At the end of the gathering, you see, that's what happened here, I think.

43:32.657 --> 43:33.699
So they have a blank painting.

43:37.624 --> 43:40.208
And I wouldn't call that quite in the same class.

43:40.228 --> 43:41.329
I don't just find that so interesting.

43:42.338 --> 43:44.680
And so, now, there's some more birds there.

43:44.700 --> 43:45.281
Well, find them.

43:45.361 --> 43:46.883
And this is what you're talking about again.

43:47.263 --> 43:47.403
Mm-hmm.

43:47.423 --> 43:48.484
Yep, exactly.

43:48.505 --> 43:50.006
Now, that's Tobit.

43:50.386 --> 43:50.887
Tobias.

43:51.207 --> 43:54.811
Yep.

43:54.831 --> 43:56.173
This is a very busy page.

43:56.193 --> 43:58.055
And this is definitely a different artist as well.

43:58.075 --> 43:58.835
Oh, I'm sure it is.

43:58.855 --> 43:59.116
Yeah.

43:59.977 --> 44:02.900
I would say so.

44:05.342 --> 44:05.763
Now, here's the book.

44:05.783 --> 44:08.886
Now, he's trying to imitate that stork earlier.

44:09.322 --> 44:10.263
Do you remember the stork?

44:10.543 --> 44:14.208
He had a snake in his mouth, the earlier stork.

44:15.349 --> 44:18.172
Yeah.

44:18.192 --> 44:19.734
He didn't have the book in front of it anymore.

44:20.375 --> 44:23.999
There's a bird that he started to draw and didn't finish in one of these places.

44:24.039 --> 44:27.944
Things are sliding downhill now.

44:27.964 --> 44:28.584
It's not the same.

44:29.005 --> 44:31.688
Does the provenance of this book go back?

44:31.708 --> 44:35.573
I mean, do you trace this back to this earlier story?

44:35.913 --> 44:37.675
Some fluke of history.

44:38.836 --> 44:41.300
And the same, look at that, see?

44:41.520 --> 44:42.501
That's right.

44:42.521 --> 44:45.966
It was just a pen sketch, and then suddenly it got called the telephone, forgot all about it.

44:45.986 --> 44:48.209
Because otherwise you'd have had one over here, maybe.

44:48.229 --> 44:51.674
Yes, he might have to balance it after he finished that.

44:51.815 --> 44:53.918
That's a particularly nice thing.

44:53.938 --> 44:56.902
Oh, yeah.

44:56.922 --> 44:58.023
That's the one I was looking for.

44:58.104 --> 45:06.075
Then there was a piece of vandalism, and in the spring of 85,

45:07.203 --> 45:16.912
Well, you see, this is not a complete copy, and I hurried over at the beginning to fill it up, because this first page is a facsimile.

45:17.612 --> 45:19.915
That is not, that was stolen.

45:19.935 --> 45:20.275
From here?

45:21.016 --> 45:29.143
No, it was stolen before even Mr. Henry Stevens had it.

45:29.964 --> 45:36.990
And we were always wondering where these facsimiles came from, because you see, they don't have any red lines through the capitals.

45:37.291 --> 45:43.417
I don't mind it, it wouldn't show up as red, but there are no lines of any color at all through those capitals.

45:43.717 --> 45:45.659
And this is the 42-line version.

45:45.819 --> 45:47.220
See, there are some red lines in there.

45:48.581 --> 45:51.804
And he decided this wasn't Ruth, so he quit for a while.

45:53.065 --> 45:54.367
It was just a preface.

45:55.848 --> 46:00.712
But here, Ruth, there's a reference to Ruth, and there's a little red there, as it were.

46:00.732 --> 46:02.954
But there are other places that have red, too.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.836
Underlined up here.

46:04.856 --> 46:05.897
Underlining over here.

46:06.367 --> 46:09.631
Yeah, Zacharias, yeah.

46:09.651 --> 46:12.175
But this fellow is working a little bit.

46:12.215 --> 46:14.077
So somebody stole a sheet out of this.

46:14.558 --> 46:17.702
It's probably framed in the house someplace right now, right?

46:17.722 --> 46:19.104
Well, I wish I knew where it was.

46:20.526 --> 46:22.308
Of course, he'd like to know then.

46:22.328 --> 46:26.114
He'd try to get as much money as he could for it, and we'd have a problem of bargaining.

46:26.534 --> 46:27.976
But where did this come from?

46:29.738 --> 46:32.843
And we would look at their English copies, and it didn't match at all.

46:33.904 --> 46:36.087
There were a total of 17 leaves that were missing.

46:36.168 --> 46:42.216
This is the only, the other 16er in the second volume looked as though he was stealing random out of the second volume.

46:43.037 --> 46:46.841
And then he grabbed this one, and then when he heard somebody come, he ran.

46:47.822 --> 47:04.403
It was in a little town in East Germany, the airport, which isn't too little anymore, as a matter of fact, in the basement of a church that sat there for 400 years, discovered in the mid-19th century, shortly before that sale.

47:05.530 --> 47:20.047
But in the spring of 85, a fellow came, a German came, named Eberhard Koenig, who had made a study of the illuminations of the copies of this book.

47:20.067 --> 47:24.573
And he took one look at these things, a murie copy.

47:24.593 --> 47:34.845
And so that summer, Marie, yeah, it was that summer, went over there and took some of the extra copies.

47:35.011 --> 47:47.209
My father replaced some of them, and had the original leaves he got hold of, bound in, and so the facsimile leaves are just loose.

47:48.050 --> 47:54.059
And I was able to take a few over there, and he communicated to my guy while he was .

47:54.079 --> 47:57.264
And they had no record over there of anybody ever having done it.

47:57.805 --> 48:01.390
And he said, oh, you've got good early lithographs.

48:02.753 --> 48:05.156
Oh, would you give him one?

48:05.176 --> 48:05.776
He said, no, no, she's not.

48:05.796 --> 48:07.779
There's an interesting early lithography.

48:09.941 --> 48:11.363
So it goes.

48:12.144 --> 48:17.230
But then there's another piece of later, I'm sure it's later vandalism.

48:18.311 --> 48:21.314
It's the beginning of Job that we see right from.

48:22.255 --> 48:23.116
There's always Job.

48:23.136 --> 48:24.218
Maybe that's where the bird was.

48:25.119 --> 48:29.504
It was an unfinished bird at the beginning of Job.

48:29.524 --> 48:30.685
Yes, it was.

48:31.289 --> 48:33.751
Prologus, Libra of Job.

48:33.771 --> 48:35.613
Job itself begins there, I guess.

48:36.474 --> 48:36.814
Okay.

48:36.834 --> 48:38.616
He really liked that train, didn't he?

48:38.636 --> 48:38.856
Yeah.

48:40.518 --> 48:45.082
All right, now we get to pass Job to the Psalms.

48:46.003 --> 48:49.587
Something awful happened.

48:49.607 --> 48:50.327
And he looked back.

48:50.347 --> 48:52.649
He said, this fellow could be looked back.

48:52.669 --> 48:54.151
He said, 19th century.

48:54.171 --> 48:55.572
Just like that.

48:55.792 --> 48:57.734
My God, how do you know?

48:58.475 --> 49:00.537
And so we looked.

49:01.883 --> 49:05.347
Turn the page, and you look down here, do you see the knife?

49:06.788 --> 49:08.470
The knife blade going through there?

49:08.490 --> 49:09.131
Can you see that?

49:10.172 --> 49:10.312
Mm-hmm.

49:10.332 --> 49:10.853
Yes, I can.

49:10.993 --> 49:11.714
Where they cut.

49:12.594 --> 49:15.117
And it goes through the second leaf very slightly there.

49:15.157 --> 49:16.699
Yeah, you can see that very slightly there.

49:17.259 --> 49:17.880
Traces of it.

49:18.180 --> 49:19.162
What happened?

49:19.182 --> 49:20.703
Somebody cut the letter out!

49:21.604 --> 49:28.952
And this has been put back in, and then you look at this thing here, and it's writing.

49:30.374 --> 49:31.755
Yes, that sort of stuff is writing.

49:32.174 --> 49:36.440
And I've compared that with the facsimile of the same place, and you can see it.

49:36.460 --> 49:36.961
You can see it.

49:37.001 --> 49:38.123
I can see it.

49:38.203 --> 49:38.924
It's very good.

49:38.984 --> 49:39.445
It's a fake.

49:39.945 --> 49:40.726
It's very good, though.

49:41.207 --> 49:41.808
Yeah, it's a fake.

49:42.429 --> 49:44.232
And it's been stuck back in there.

49:44.392 --> 49:47.316
So somebody chopped out a letter, or sliced out a letter.

49:47.336 --> 49:48.558
Sliced out whatever was there.

49:50.160 --> 49:53.766
And this inferior artist was, he wanted it.

49:54.627 --> 49:55.648
And then he got it.

49:55.668 --> 49:58.232
And then it repaired before the book was sold.

49:58.685 --> 50:02.410
And it may not have ever, ever been discovered, but Phyllis Fella Kearney came along.

50:02.531 --> 50:03.732
He saw it, huh?

50:03.752 --> 50:07.878
No, he spotted that right and said, that's 19th century.

50:07.898 --> 50:08.740
Isn't that so funny?

50:08.760 --> 50:11.364
That's not a forgery, isn't it?

50:11.384 --> 50:16.231
Right, who would have noticed, you know, the very tear there?

50:16.251 --> 50:18.133
You can see it once you know it's there, you can see it.

50:18.193 --> 50:20.958
It's not all the way through, but it's an indebted cut.

50:21.879 --> 50:23.421
But that's pretty apparent right there.

50:24.182 --> 50:26.185
Oh, yes, you bet, yes.

50:26.205 --> 50:28.168
When you look at it, you can see it very, very clearly.

50:29.836 --> 50:30.777
Absolutely.

50:30.798 --> 50:36.527
And someone's tried very hard to reproduce what he thought ought to be there.

50:37.248 --> 50:39.291
Isn't that funny?

50:39.351 --> 50:41.174
Yeah.

50:41.194 --> 50:43.097
So that's one body.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.871
That's great.

50:51.891 --> 50:53.954
That was really exciting.

50:53.994 --> 50:54.355
Yeah.

50:54.435 --> 50:57.700
And you want to put it back in there?

50:59.148 --> 51:12.625
This is the vault over here, I gather.

51:12.645 --> 51:13.927
This is the treasure vault.

51:14.708 --> 51:26.843
This is a somewhat rarer book than the Bible.

51:26.863 --> 51:28.104
Somewhat rarer, you say?

51:28.184 --> 51:28.665
Oh, yes.

51:29.827 --> 51:33.474
And there is no copy of it in this country.

51:34.616 --> 51:41.768
I'll tell you what to do.

51:41.788 --> 51:48.420
Before you open that thing, you put that away.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.965
There's a facsimile of it.

51:50.985 --> 51:51.786
I shall open it out.

51:51.907 --> 51:53.269
I'm fine with it.
