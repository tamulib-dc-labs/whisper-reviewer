00:02.917 --> 00:28.050
One thing I'm investigating, I'm looking into, trying to develop, is this whole idea that not just the contemporary booksellers, but the real booksellers, they bring an attitude, a scholarly attitude.

00:28.070 --> 00:28.711
Oh, sure, I take it back a step.

00:28.731 --> 00:29.512
Booksellers don't advance universities.

00:29.532 --> 00:30.173
Universities invent booksellers.

00:30.625 --> 00:55.553
It was the European Almagres as a whole that fueled the American universities, that fueled the Almagre booksellers.

00:55.573 --> 00:58.036
The great days of the Almagres, after all, were the days when they were largely selling the libraries, not the individuals.

00:58.056 --> 00:58.757
It was the presence of Christeller.

00:58.777 --> 00:59.738
And today, you know, this is called Christeller.

01:00.545 --> 01:20.924
Okay, that's like saying you don't know George Washington when you're talking about American history.

01:20.944 --> 01:21.766
Paul Oscar Cristela, still alive, age 92.

01:21.786 --> 01:22.146
Yeah, still alive.

01:22.166 --> 01:22.347
Columbia.

01:22.367 --> 01:22.447
Yes.

01:22.467 --> 01:23.008
He's old, well, but he's...

01:22.988 --> 01:25.632
He's quite somehow.

01:25.672 --> 01:33.365
The contact there is Robert Somerville, S-O-M-E-R-V-I-L-L-E.

01:33.385 --> 01:37.752
He's in the book I sponsored that spot.

01:37.832 --> 01:42.660
Somerville is a professor of religion at Columbia, student of Costello.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.505
He's in Columbia, but he looks after him again.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.131
So, Bob Somerville, who's an admirable person, very senior at Columbia.

01:49.972 --> 02:04.170
would be able to say, look, he's too old, he can't do it.

02:04.190 --> 02:04.751
Or, he has good days, maybe.

02:04.771 --> 02:07.174
He's a professor of the Legion at Columbia.

02:07.194 --> 02:07.935
He's in the book Espresso Drespo.

02:07.955 --> 02:09.356
And what areas would this play?

02:09.376 --> 02:11.940
Chris Teller studied Renaissance manuscripts.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.165
He trained, he was a German Armageddon who went to Pisa.

02:17.680 --> 02:36.737
and Hitler got together, he fled and came to this country.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.981
He spent his entire working career at Columbia and he is the best known humanist in this country to a European.

02:39.001 --> 02:39.402
You won't like them.

02:39.888 --> 02:45.739
because their calendars and manuscripts are very difficult.

02:45.759 --> 02:47.442
But he's done some good autobiographical pieces.

02:47.462 --> 02:50.888
There are now, I believe, five test strips.

02:50.908 --> 02:57.280
There are five test strips in Costello's honor, two of which some are related.

02:57.300 --> 03:00.546
The prefaces to those test strips

03:03.648 --> 03:20.535
But it's not just Costello, it's Paul Henry, just to take Columbia, the ones I know, Paul Henry Lang in music, Rudolph Lipkovert in art, Meyer Shapiro in art, it just goes on and on and on.

03:20.555 --> 03:24.922
There's Peter Gay in history, you look around, Leo Gershoy in history.

03:25.082 --> 03:30.010
That generation trained a whole generation of Americans

03:30.648 --> 03:42.632
at a time when our scholarship was pretty bad and universities began becoming the great research universities that they now are and they needed books.

03:43.996 --> 03:49.845
How do you buy German books?

03:49.865 --> 03:55.313
You know, do you get a German bookshelf?

03:55.333 --> 04:01.102
Well, that's exactly what Roger said.

04:01.122 --> 04:04.327
He said, we're not talking about Shakespeare.

04:04.347 --> 04:05.168
I understand that Roger made a statement.

04:05.188 --> 04:06.370
He said, and this is without vile or irony.

04:06.390 --> 04:08.173
He said, it's amazing what we ought to do.

04:08.193 --> 04:09.595
You know, I mean, we wouldn't have certain things as we'd have.

04:09.615 --> 04:09.875
That's right.

04:09.895 --> 04:10.476
We had Santa and our mission.

04:11.165 --> 04:16.370
and a bit of entrepreneurial spirit through a child, and we had the resources.

04:16.870 --> 04:29.743
All you had to do was tell the president of Indiana that Kansas was getting close, and you got a new building, because Kansas' ambition is to be as big as Indiana.

04:29.803 --> 04:37.710
It wouldn't scare Indiana a bit if you said Nebraska was getting close, because the president of Indiana would know that's a lie.

04:37.730 --> 04:40.733
But if you told the president of Indiana they were approaching Illinois,

04:41.320 --> 04:43.562
Now there you've got something.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.825
What would they do as a class of class?

04:45.845 --> 04:48.167
Buy more books.

04:48.307 --> 04:51.631
And you would decide what they needed.

04:51.731 --> 04:52.031
Okay.

04:52.051 --> 04:57.877
At Illinois, before he went on to become president of the Guggenheim, Gordon Ray was provost.

04:58.158 --> 05:05.685
Gordon Ray spent a month in England every year buying English language books for the library as a vacation.

05:06.146 --> 05:11.091
He used to travel with the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literacy, checked off four volumes.

05:12.168 --> 05:24.342
you know, which is a complete list of virtually everything.

05:24.362 --> 05:30.109
And if there wasn't a check mark, and Gordon saw a copy, he bought it.

05:32.631 --> 05:33.052
Unlimited pockets.

05:33.072 --> 05:34.994
And the stuff was thick on the ground, too.

05:35.014 --> 05:36.876
And David Esquin was doing it at Toronto.

05:36.896 --> 05:41.061
The legendary acquisition people who, Lawrence Park Powell, still alive, was doing it at UCLA.

05:42.340 --> 05:45.765
Robert Bosford was doing it at Kansas.

05:45.906 --> 05:53.858
It was the period of the great acquisitions where libraries were doubling every five or six years.

05:54.299 --> 05:56.723
And this is in the immediate aftermath of World War II is, oh, it isn't.

05:56.743 --> 05:57.484
It's after that.

05:57.504 --> 05:58.526
People say that, but it's wrong.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.609
You look at the figures.

06:00.629 --> 06:07.460
It really doesn't start until the late 50s because it took so long to get organized and to get that generation of undergraduates through.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.204
You see, then the baby boom came so that everything was going.

06:11.230 --> 06:14.815
And library acquisitions wrote on that.

06:14.835 --> 06:19.400
That is when he said that there's not enormous growth at the time.

06:19.481 --> 06:23.806
And again, ask Ken and Stubbs about the statistics, which are all published.

06:23.826 --> 06:24.947
The statistics are there.

06:25.028 --> 06:28.252
But you can see the line going on.

06:28.272 --> 06:31.215
And it's hard to pull it directly to these statistics.

06:31.316 --> 06:35.601
I mean, look, they're in about their annuals, I can say.

06:38.230 --> 06:44.379
which for 20 years was a place everybody went for library statistics.

06:44.439 --> 06:50.007
You know, it's a role in every library you're going to go into.

06:50.027 --> 07:00.723
So back to the Rutgers Press, my fortune was to commit this justice just after a few.

07:00.743 --> 07:03.006
I mean, I started the Rutgers Press in 73.

07:05.129 --> 07:17.647
in the early days, in part because there were suddenly no jobs in academia.

07:17.667 --> 07:26.540
And people in the pipeline who had expected to have the teaching careers came to me after they got their doctorates.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.904
At one point, a quarter of my students had doctorates, and about half of them were ABD.

07:28.924 --> 07:32.689
And almost all of them had a second master's before they even came to me, which is so they had a first master's and were about to get a second.

07:34.745 --> 07:43.494
So, when Alex Schreier came to me, she was just finishing.

07:43.514 --> 07:50.040
Dan Traster had his goods free before he came to me.

07:50.060 --> 07:52.863
Sam Stride had gone as far as he was going to go.

07:53.103 --> 07:54.885
Alex is at the Midway, right?

07:54.905 --> 07:55.605
No, she's at the Midway, right?

07:55.625 --> 07:56.246
No, she's at the Midway, right?

07:56.266 --> 07:57.607
She's at the Midway.

07:58.028 --> 07:58.748
The name of Merlin, last year.

07:58.768 --> 07:59.049
Very nice one.

07:59.069 --> 07:59.689
I really can get back to Texas.

07:59.709 --> 08:00.010
Very competent.

08:00.030 --> 08:00.330
Very competent.

08:02.572 --> 08:06.758
century English literature Emery.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.781
She's a classy lady, a classy dame.

08:08.881 --> 08:12.166
We're not going to tell her that, are we?

08:12.186 --> 08:21.219
She was married to a very prominent New York lawyer, a partner, Chad Brown Park.

08:22.521 --> 08:24.184
And the two of them own Stillo.

08:24.204 --> 08:28.490
They're no longer married, but still friendly.

08:28.510 --> 08:30.553
They own one of the great private postal collections.

08:32.373 --> 08:39.081
but great, a very serious collector.

08:39.101 --> 08:43.867
Callis is remarried, and so is Les.

08:43.887 --> 08:47.331
But that's where the scholar comes in.

08:47.351 --> 08:49.193
He was Columbia, she was Barnard.

08:49.213 --> 08:54.880
And he went down to Emory as an associate, I'm sorry, went down to Atlanta as an associate.

08:54.900 --> 08:59.325
This is the late 60s, early 70s, and Callis went to school.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.329
That's why she was an Emory doctorate.

09:03.136 --> 09:12.205
That's what wives did.

09:12.225 --> 09:21.193
At least when you're Alice, that's what wives did.

09:21.213 --> 09:22.755
Are there any libraries today that are really building?

09:22.775 --> 09:23.315
Oh, we're all building.

09:23.335 --> 09:23.976
Sure, we all are.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.739
But we're just not doing it in all areas anymore.

09:26.759 --> 09:30.102
Virginia's got the best collection of American literature in the world.

09:30.122 --> 09:31.303
Yeah, okay, but we didn't stop buying American literature.

09:32.279 --> 09:33.840
and aggressively.

09:34.341 --> 09:40.606
We're not buying as much everything else as we used to to support it.

09:40.626 --> 09:43.309
You're not going to see Ellen Dunlap let Americana go by.

09:43.329 --> 09:49.134
They're not breaking Idaho with the enthusiasm they used to.

09:49.154 --> 09:53.738
We're all specializing more, in other words.

09:53.798 --> 09:54.819
We're buying in-depth.

09:54.839 --> 09:58.622
And indeed, I think it's what happens to a collector as he matures, isn't it?

09:58.642 --> 10:00.784
When I started in this business, I bought everything removed.

10:02.013 --> 10:04.337
Now I buy- You made mistakes.

10:04.357 --> 10:08.944
They weren't mistakes, but my mouth is bigger than my stomach.

10:09.365 --> 10:12.650
Now I buy illustrations personally.

10:12.670 --> 10:19.841
And I buy books on the book published before 1915 in mint condition.

10:20.002 --> 10:23.467
Because I want them to do only one- I'm never going to read them.

10:23.487 --> 10:25.951
I want them to do only one thing for me.

10:25.971 --> 10:28.375
I want them to cheer me up when I come home.

10:28.760 --> 10:35.287
If you do that, they'll have to be in perfect condition.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.188
Let's do decoration.

10:36.368 --> 10:37.309
They'll decorate mine.

10:37.329 --> 10:38.750
And my books sing.

10:39.010 --> 10:42.954
You'll clearly see books that you won't believe the condition of.

10:42.994 --> 10:45.437
That's what I want them to do.

10:45.497 --> 10:50.382
And then you'll see that I have it in a dust jar, and you didn't even know there was one.

10:50.502 --> 10:51.263
I might use that quote.

10:51.383 --> 10:53.485
I'm doing a piece with the New York Times.

10:53.971 --> 11:08.972
What I've tried to do here, and that's what all collectors do.

11:10.894 --> 11:21.649
You have to make it far enough

11:22.405 --> 11:36.046
So that your need for books is not outstricted by the availability.

11:36.066 --> 11:43.097
When I see a book, if I see a book at the fair tomorrow that meets my standards and conditions, I'll buy it and I can afford it.

11:43.558 --> 11:47.704
Because I can't buy that much for this collection because I can't get the books.

11:49.793 --> 12:01.056
If my limit was 1945 instead of 1915, then I couldn't afford my own collection because you could buy then 1940s books on books pretty easily.

12:01.076 --> 12:03.642
So how did you select the date 1915?

12:03.662 --> 12:09.574
Well, I know the field pretty well, and I knew that I wanted to spend a couple of thousand bucks a year on the collection.

12:09.714 --> 12:11.177
I didn't want to spend more than others.

12:12.102 --> 12:19.756
And I thought, well, I might be able to do that if it's 1915.

12:19.876 --> 12:26.809
If it were 1900, I couldn't buy anything in that price range almost.

12:26.949 --> 12:33.942
I talked to the author that was her third piece on

12:40.334 --> 12:47.265
I tried to help and gave her some names, and when I saw her drafts, I threw it and her away.

12:47.625 --> 12:51.732
It was terrible, and what was published was terrible.

12:51.752 --> 12:55.558
I mean, look, there are plenty of people out there who know this stuff.

12:55.578 --> 13:04.131
It's not that difficult to find somebody who's got a perfectly respectable piece in this month's issue, the one that just came by Sid Berger on Foreman.

13:04.634 --> 13:07.660
I agree with everything he said.

13:07.961 --> 13:17.641
And that's okay because I've taught format in relation to more people than anybody else who ever lived in this country and still am.

13:17.662 --> 13:22.592
And I get another 30 to 35 people every year.

13:22.612 --> 13:25.478
That's a lot of marbles on the board and I get a new bag every year.

13:26.707 --> 13:30.436
on their advisory board, that's good.

13:30.456 --> 13:31.539
So where's Richard Langdon?

13:31.559 --> 13:32.401
Why does New Rights Board?

13:32.421 --> 13:34.045
He's on their board.

13:34.066 --> 13:38.657
So why don't you send the people they probably know something?

13:39.245 --> 13:52.726
A rumor that is so persistent that I assume it's true, I would be glad you know it's not, that they bought and then killed the English map magazine because they didn't like their advertising rates.

13:52.746 --> 13:53.767
That's news to me.

13:53.787 --> 13:58.535
You might want to explore that.

13:58.555 --> 14:01.559
The map people don't like good ones.

14:01.579 --> 14:01.800
Go ahead.

14:01.820 --> 14:02.220
I won't use it.

14:02.240 --> 14:02.581
It's true.

14:02.601 --> 14:06.687
The president of Boston University, of Boston College, I'm getting started.

14:07.493 --> 14:09.256
a rare book library.

14:09.316 --> 14:15.945
His name I can certainly produce for you through social context.

14:15.965 --> 14:18.669
He had no previous experience in rare books.

14:19.230 --> 14:20.852
None.

14:21.112 --> 14:23.756
He was back on his own computers.

14:25.178 --> 14:26.660
But he had a good line.

14:26.760 --> 14:30.606
I remember that it didn't work out so well.

14:30.626 --> 14:33.450
And Selby Piper, who would know all about this,

14:34.240 --> 14:43.789
discovered that he's another former student of mine, by the way, as is Kimball Higgs, as is Chris Hoover, as is Nieden Mzinski.

14:43.949 --> 14:51.476
You know, it's much of a muchness.

14:51.637 --> 15:02.627
He sent the books personally to Sotheby's for sale and Selby got suspicious and worked it out.

15:05.763 --> 15:08.726
The Rare Book Library went up the river.

15:08.846 --> 15:09.667
How long ago was this?

15:09.687 --> 15:11.369
This must have been Centennial.

15:11.389 --> 15:12.510
Later 80s.

15:12.530 --> 15:20.077
It has to be well after Rare Book School because the guy attended a Rare Book School course and indeed was legendary.

15:20.218 --> 15:22.640
He didn't want to attend the course.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.682
He wanted to come to New York and play tennis.

15:24.702 --> 15:28.206
He was the only person in the history of Rare Book School.

15:28.226 --> 15:29.086
Fourteen years.

15:29.107 --> 15:32.390
The only person who had an attendance problem.

15:32.410 --> 15:34.572
He would show up an hour late in the tennis courts.

15:37.522 --> 15:39.964
I've got it in trial.

15:40.745 --> 15:48.072
Well, look, when he went to the big house, I figured he probably wasn't going to cross my path again.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.553
He did go to prison.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.616
He went to prison for two years.

15:52.636 --> 15:53.517
Oh, yeah, no.

15:53.897 --> 15:55.338
Mark Hoffman.

15:55.539 --> 15:56.079
I'm sorry?

15:57.821 --> 16:03.286
Mark Hoffman applied for a real good school course and got in.

16:03.426 --> 16:05.908
But he got blown away before...

16:06.395 --> 16:31.930
so we get them all you know i have an authentic often signature justin says it's one of the rare real ones he applied for schiller's children's course of course but too late it's got 300 people every year now mind you 50 percent of them are repeat offenders

16:32.905 --> 16:58.356
not from last year about a third of the people this year will be there will have been there last year as well but about half of them even though before and the average faculty member who is not who is not new this year is coming back for their seventh or eighth time so it's a you know it's a loyal buyer and look i mean it's a cricket game but it's the only one i've had

17:01.677 --> 17:17.953
when somebody prepared to find you 12 students of the year on medieval and early Renaissance book writing structure, and it's symbiosis with a vengeance.

17:17.973 --> 17:25.200
I think most of us would agree he knows more about 15th century physiography than anybody else in this country.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.803
But Paul's, for some reason,

17:28.458 --> 17:38.170
Where else is he going to teach good people for a week, which is about what he can spare?

17:38.250 --> 17:45.539
And if you take a medium's course, if you're a librarian or a bookseller, because you want to buy an acquaintance with him.

17:45.559 --> 17:48.002
Because how do you meet him?

17:48.382 --> 17:51.946
And it's, you know, I mean, all of his offenders either.

17:51.966 --> 17:57.133
How the hell do you meet the vice president of Sotheby's if you're a rare book librarian in Kansas?

17:57.153 --> 17:57.553
Thank you very much.

17:58.107 --> 18:02.933
But at their book school, the classes are limited to 12 people.

18:02.953 --> 18:16.930
And you're in a room with Paul Needham and 10 other people for 30 hours, six hours a day.

18:16.950 --> 18:24.739
And because it's Charlottesville and things are quiet in the summer, you're probably having lunch with half your class and dinner with the other half for the lunch.

18:26.356 --> 18:38.892
so that you get, that's why you really ought to see rare books go to appreciate it, you get these pure street farewells at the end of the week that are remarkable because it costs bonds.

18:39.332 --> 18:44.358
And along about Wednesday lunchtime they start lock-stepping through life together.

18:44.378 --> 18:50.406
Because there you are, you know, the rare book library in Kansas, you want to find rare book librarians.

18:50.446 --> 18:54.591
The rest of the stock by and large beats you.

19:05.506 --> 19:09.531
It's open 114 hours a week.

19:09.551 --> 19:18.722
There are 16 reference librarians, and there can be six people waiting for their services, each one.

19:18.802 --> 19:26.672
If there were five fewer rare book librarians, there could be two more reference librarians, and that would help the community at large.

19:27.052 --> 19:33.640
The typical reference librarian in Kansas, and I'm not making this up, I'm taking a specific example, who told me this.

19:34.733 --> 19:39.823
shifted out of reference to rare books.

19:39.943 --> 19:44.933
And the colleagues felt that he had betrayed them because he was needed where he was.

19:44.953 --> 19:46.616
There was a job freeze on it.

19:46.636 --> 19:47.999
He couldn't be replaced.

19:48.019 --> 19:52.567
Suddenly he's in a place that has fewer readers in a week than they have in an hour.

19:54.251 --> 19:57.096
It's 9 to 5, Monday through Friday and Saturday morning.

19:57.869 --> 20:08.601
of its quaint and old wood and quiet.

20:08.861 --> 20:19.694
So, his name is Robert Melton, former student of mine.

20:19.714 --> 20:21.075
He has an interest for the safety argument in 19th century bindings.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.797
He comes out of

20:24.194 --> 20:41.193
environment where at best it's a genial indifference and at worst active hostility with a specialty of a subject in which nobody at Kansas is interested at all or even believes in.

20:42.034 --> 20:47.620
Suddenly he's into a book school with 11 other students who've traveled up to 3,000 miles.

20:48.325 --> 21:02.347
We take the course and we feel not only the world's greatest authority, but the world's only authority on the subject, Sue Allen.

21:02.367 --> 21:05.872
Well, what happens in the class on Wednesday lunchtime?

21:05.892 --> 21:07.675
It's like a bunch of asparagus.

21:07.695 --> 21:09.938
They even start looking alike.

21:10.199 --> 21:12.382
And they send each other Christmas cards.

21:12.402 --> 21:14.425
They send each other the class pictures.

21:14.445 --> 21:15.447
It's like summer camp.

21:16.118 --> 21:37.193
Oh, you betcha.

21:37.214 --> 21:37.895
There's a history-conscious place.

21:37.915 --> 21:38.456
It's a little conservative.

21:38.476 --> 21:39.177
It's got a great rare book library.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.098
It's a place people want to come visit.

21:40.118 --> 21:41.080
You know, it's on University of the First Class.

21:42.680 --> 22:04.811
What it doesn't do is size and focus.

22:04.831 --> 22:05.853
I'm Harvard, Columbia, Chicago, Berkeley, Stanford.

22:05.873 --> 22:06.714
These are universities of the first class.

22:06.734 --> 22:07.936
Primarily the first, with a trophy undergraduate collection.

22:07.956 --> 22:08.817
Virginia is university of the second class.

22:08.837 --> 22:11.100
Its primary emphasis is undergraduate education, although it has very fine graduate schools, but they're smaller.

22:12.160 --> 22:36.561
But it is a first grade university of the second class.

22:36.581 --> 22:37.902
I spent 29 years at a second grade institution of the first class.

22:37.922 --> 22:38.843
And that was a very lowering effect over time.

22:38.863 --> 22:40.544
Columbia's strategy these days seems to me to be to get worse as slowly as possible.

22:40.564 --> 22:41.425
And that's not a very attractive group that

22:45.623 --> 23:01.185
because everything in New York costs three times as much to do as it does anywhere else.

23:01.205 --> 23:05.551
It costs three times as much to build a building, to maintain it, or to do anything to it.

23:05.571 --> 23:08.555
And they'll have the habit of a year endowment over the long haul, in other words.

23:08.575 --> 23:10.017
They can't compete because it's too expensive for them to do business.

23:10.037 --> 23:15.445
And the only way institutions in New York, to my mind, can compete is to have a ferocious preoccupation with excellence.

23:15.931 --> 23:32.859
The MAP, all of the MAPs compete for that reason, because they're very, very good.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.021
Rockefeller University competes, along the way, survives.

23:34.041 --> 23:34.402
They're very good.

23:34.422 --> 23:35.043
They've done a lot of research.

23:35.063 --> 23:35.603
They've lasted a long time.

23:35.624 --> 23:36.245
I like it getting a lot better.

23:36.265 --> 23:37.146
I think it's perfect for what they're doing.

23:38.830 --> 23:44.780
I'm a university professor.

23:44.800 --> 23:54.095
I report to the president.

23:54.115 --> 23:54.696
I have no fixed duties.

23:54.716 --> 23:55.657
I can teach in any department that will ask me.

23:55.677 --> 23:56.619
The dome room is my exhibition space.

23:56.639 --> 23:58.662
I put students up on the lawn, as you saw.

24:01.747 --> 24:23.314
That's why I say, the offense of the Book Arts Press is important to the well-being of the Book Arts Press, but the University of Virginia is indispensable.

24:23.334 --> 24:24.815
Now, there would be other places maybe if it didn't work out, but it does.

24:24.835 --> 24:26.097
I'm looking beyond your own stewardship in the Book Arts Press.

24:26.117 --> 24:26.978
Do you think this is something that it was?

24:28.223 --> 24:39.356
Well, that's always the question, isn't it?

24:39.896 --> 24:41.318
Who knows?

24:41.378 --> 24:45.543
I've got a board.

24:45.563 --> 24:47.305
You know them all.

24:47.325 --> 24:54.713
Martin Antonetti, Alan Dunlap, Nicholas Picklery.

24:54.733 --> 24:57.977
Captain Morgan, you have a program at East University of Virginia with local contact.

24:58.615 --> 25:26.243
James Davis, Warburg Southern UCLA, Warburg School staff contact, Nicholas Dickward, Warburg School faculty contact, Martin Antonetti, former student, Don Dunlap, Big Shot in the Big World, and one other whom you wouldn't know, who's a New York TV director and producer.

25:26.813 --> 25:46.969
The logic of this explains itself.

25:46.989 --> 25:48.973
What I'm mostly concerned with at this point is that if I get run over by a bus,

25:50.084 --> 26:03.402
The assets of the press are owned by the trustees, are owned by the board of directors, not by the university.

26:03.422 --> 26:08.429
They will then, and they all know this, they will then go into negotiation with the university.

26:08.449 --> 26:12.315
If the university will replace me, then the Book Arts Press will stay in Virginia.

26:12.335 --> 26:16.260
If the university does not wish to replace me at their expense, then they will take the assets of the Book Arts Press

26:18.485 --> 26:45.304
which, yeah, but more importantly, thanks to my unfortunate demise, my personal estate, which is large enough to be interesting, can negotiate with whoever wants your book school and a book arts class.

26:45.324 --> 26:46.425
So as a stopgast, this is not a permanent solution.

26:46.445 --> 26:47.227
I don't want to get run over.

26:47.247 --> 26:47.547
My question is,

26:50.868 --> 26:57.882
I've had a board, I've had a do-nothing board.

26:58.182 --> 27:03.012
It's about to become a do-something board.

27:03.032 --> 27:11.168
And it's now actually going to need formally to advise me annually, augmented by five additional advisors.

27:11.188 --> 27:13.112
Kathy Leib, Bill Barlow,

27:14.088 --> 27:35.641
Bill Joyce, and two other seasons, I'd have to look at the list to remember.

27:35.661 --> 27:36.903
It's not on my mind at the moment.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.586
I don't want a wealth board to go, that's not an absolutely inconsiderable bunch.

27:38.606 --> 27:39.387
Or I want a wisdom board at this point.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.950
I can raise money, that's not what I want them for.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.492
I want them to keep me alive, to the extent that I'm willing to do at least.

27:47.753 --> 28:10.197
Kathy, this is, I'm sure you know this, this is a book of very old, very good friends.

28:10.217 --> 28:11.238
I can't believe it's four days over now, literally.

28:11.258 --> 28:12.460
I've known her and Dan intimately for more than 20 years.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.382
His collection of Orwells on loan to me at the moment is in the Rotunda.

28:14.402 --> 28:15.583
The show that was here but with major changes is now called

28:15.935 --> 28:21.022
Did you walk by your show here at least?

28:21.043 --> 28:31.057
Well, in the traditional version it's called Normal Stories Don't Sell in America, Mr. Orwell.

28:31.518 --> 28:35.223
George Orwell and his publishers.

28:35.243 --> 28:39.610
And it's about George Orwell's attempt to get published, which is almost what The Glowier Show was about.

28:39.630 --> 28:40.090
It's a better show now.

28:40.111 --> 28:41.132
The catalog comes out next week a little late.

28:45.331 --> 29:07.317
Dan Leib, if I suddenly discovered his first generation German, I didn't know.

29:07.337 --> 29:07.777
He came over as a kid.

29:07.797 --> 29:09.820
He writes in this book, this stellar writing book, which requires a bit more editing than I expected.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.503
Very good stuff, but compare what he wrote in the Orwell catalog we've got with similar but quite different things than you get mine.

29:18.777 --> 29:40.887
He was assistant director of Irving School in 1983, associate director in 8489, and acting director in 89.

29:40.907 --> 29:41.387
I visited him in Oregon.

29:41.407 --> 29:41.868
I visited him in Mills.

29:41.888 --> 29:43.350
I was an enthusiastic promoter with him for the gallery of golf.

29:45.895 --> 30:07.738
I've done it for a long time.

30:07.758 --> 30:09.140
And this, I suppose, is what gets me up in the morning at the moment.

30:09.160 --> 30:09.640
I have 25 years of this.

30:09.660 --> 30:10.241
And they're wonderful people.

30:10.261 --> 30:11.142
I've known Ellen Dunlap since the early 70s.

30:11.162 --> 30:12.223
Had a lot to do with their getting the Rosenbach job.

30:17.941 --> 30:31.672
Unfortunately, I pushed hard for it when one of the members of the search committee was the member of the search committee who didn't want it.

30:31.692 --> 30:33.035
That was Rocky Steinhower, who had another 10.

30:33.055 --> 30:33.596
Rocky had another 10 of us.

30:33.616 --> 30:34.077
It was Kevin Garganino.

30:34.681 --> 30:58.884
who's now gone to the Wisconsin Historical Society and served.

30:58.904 --> 31:00.145
That's going to be one of the great jobs in the United States.

31:00.165 --> 31:00.565
It's a little world.

31:00.585 --> 31:01.566
It's a little competition with rare book schools.

31:02.710 --> 31:24.396
The railroad school is bigger, considerably bigger than all the other, literally than all the other continuing education opportunities in Railbrook's put together.

31:24.416 --> 31:24.657
Much bigger.

31:24.677 --> 31:28.161
That includes the Railbrook Street Conference, the Steinhauer's Dartmouth Program, the Indiana Lilly Library Program, the Jake Charnowski's Denver Program.

31:29.288 --> 31:39.442
I mean, Jake has 80 people for five days.

31:39.462 --> 31:44.990
I'm 300 people for five days.

31:45.010 --> 31:49.036
The Rare Booksmith conference is 200 people for three days.

31:49.056 --> 31:51.880
So that it all, it comes together a lot and you just, Rare Booksmith is genuinely excited.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.322
You want to know a question, you just wait for morning coffee.

31:55.158 --> 32:10.956
And in week four this summer, Nicholas Picklow and Nicholas Paul and Chris Clarkson and Paul Needham are all teaching the same week.

32:11.036 --> 32:13.999
You've got a question about a real binding?

32:14.019 --> 32:18.104
No, I mean, it's really exciting when the three of them get together.

32:18.124 --> 32:20.627
Do you try to attend as many of these?

32:20.647 --> 32:23.730
Well, I don't ever attend any because I teach three weeks out of four myself.

32:24.824 --> 32:44.481
But a good thing, too, because my classes produce just about 20% of the gross of their book school.

32:44.501 --> 32:50.927
And since I don't cost the school anything, I mean, on the different speech, I'm 20% of the gross than their book school would fold if I didn't.

32:50.947 --> 32:53.489
So I teach book collecting with Bill Barlow, and book illustrations by myself, and descriptive bibliography with somebody.

32:53.509 --> 32:54.510
It used to be David Ferris, now a speech at Noble.

32:57.258 --> 33:10.817
And because the one class in Red Book School we allowed to grow, as big as it was, does big, can go up to 40 people, it has an immense income potential.

33:10.937 --> 33:15.683
Because it's basically a bunch of lab instructors and students.

33:15.703 --> 33:24.916
So if every three students hire a lab instructor, and they do format and play in a pile of books, then go have a lab session, and then just keep doing it.

33:24.936 --> 33:25.677
Should we walk back?

33:26.118 --> 33:26.218
Yeah.

33:27.110 --> 33:27.991
you
