00:04.773 --> 00:19.431
So as I started as a scholar, I mean I was always addicted to literature, but I started as a scholar and then I developed into what I am now.

00:20.773 --> 00:26.460
So this is perhaps not so surprising, but I always liked what is

00:27.183 --> 00:29.968
what is tough, you know, what is difficult.

00:31.030 --> 00:37.041
I wrote, Dankeschön, this looks good.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.466
Enjoy.

00:39.546 --> 00:46.018
That's interesting, you have scholars come to do work with the material.

00:46.657 --> 00:53.403
Nearly every two weeks, we have scholars from Paris, from the United States.

00:53.544 --> 00:57.487
In this summer, we had three scholars from the United States.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.409
Now, tell me about that, your attitude on that.

00:59.429 --> 01:00.230
That's very important.

01:00.250 --> 01:06.556
Well, you know, they want to see books, especially manuscripts, in my possession.

01:07.157 --> 01:12.782
For instance, Professor Meredith Tilbury McMunn came...

01:13.235 --> 01:28.353
to see a Roman de la Rose manuscript in my possession because she's writing a census of all extant copies of the Roman de la Rose manuscripts, illustrated Roman de la Rose manuscripts.

01:28.553 --> 01:41.689
Elizabeth Buren came to see my Lyonnais, so my manuscripts from Lyons in the 15th century and so on and so on.

01:42.023 --> 01:48.590
within two weeks Akiko Komada from Paris will come to see my Biblio historial manuscript and so on.

01:49.151 --> 02:06.370
So if not from time to time I decline one of those demands, I could just entertain scholars from all over the world at the Bibelmühle.

02:06.750 --> 02:10.174
And as news have spread,

02:10.357 --> 02:12.901
that it's nice at the Bibermühle.

02:13.481 --> 02:21.312
So, these demands are more and more frequent.

02:21.333 --> 02:24.517
Well, I'm sure you consider the merits of the request, too.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.800
I mean, the scholarly interest of the... Of course.

02:26.820 --> 02:27.201
Of course.

02:27.301 --> 02:27.681
No, no.

02:27.702 --> 02:34.952
For me, this is also the reason for me to give manuscripts and books to exhibitions.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.275
I mean, nearly...

02:39.061 --> 02:48.937
Every two months I get the demand from a library that they want one or two or many manuscripts from me for an exhibition.

02:49.818 --> 03:06.705
Even the Morgan Library, who obviously does not need any manuscript, but they want for an exhibition in one or two years about Jean Poirier, the leading French book illuminator, around 1500.

03:07.360 --> 03:17.074
They want two manuscripts from me because there's only 11 or 12 existing manuscripts by Jean Poet and I possess two of them.

03:20.118 --> 03:37.063
So today I have sent to the librarian of the Bibliothèque Royale in Brussels photographs, color transparencies,

03:37.330 --> 03:46.479
of two manuscripts of mine which they use for the catalogue and then they get two manuscripts for their exhibition of Willem Breland.

03:46.900 --> 03:57.090
He was the code painter to Philip the Good of Burgundy and which will take place in December and January this year and the next year.

03:57.651 --> 03:59.532
So they want two manuscripts of me.

03:59.552 --> 04:07.000
I mean, I'm the only private person to whom they

04:09.140 --> 04:37.780
turn for these things you mentioned earlier that how many manuscripts are there in private hands no no not in private hands I mean one has to be quite correct in the market in the market there are between 220 and 250 manuscripts of course in private hands available for private yes yes I understood that I'm sorry

04:39.953 --> 05:06.552
in private hands there are fortunately thousands thousands of them still thousands but most of them are in old noble collections or so and will never be sold as I say one never knows do one yeah but if they are sold as for instance

05:08.405 --> 05:16.514
the manuscripts of Holcomb Hall, the Earl of Leicester, then they are sold to the Bodleian Library or to the British Library.

05:17.415 --> 05:23.742
Of course, they won't be sold to any private individual or to any dealer.

05:24.623 --> 05:30.850
Do you ever feel that certain things belong in an institutional collection?

05:31.010 --> 05:31.691
Yes, of course.

05:31.911 --> 05:38.158
I mean, this is without a doubt the case with...

05:38.442 --> 06:07.858
monuments I mean the Lindisfarne Gospels or the Book of Kells or the Nibelungenlied in Germany or the Chanson de Roland this belongs to great institutional preferably national libraries of course but what for instance the French do with their

06:08.311 --> 06:38.250
understanding of the patrimony this is really too much really I mean it is nearly impossible for me to buy any important French manuscript from France officially I have to say that because one has to submit it to the Bibliothèque Nationale and

06:38.703 --> 06:47.696
Last year I tried to buy a very important salter and I had already paid 3 million French francs for it.

06:48.938 --> 07:06.904
And then, before collecting this manuscript, I got a letter from the Ministre de la Culture, Mr. Toubon, telling that they had now found that this manuscript is a historical monument.

07:07.627 --> 07:16.421
and then that they had put three years export defense on it.

07:17.022 --> 07:19.005
So I could not export it for three years.

07:20.708 --> 07:33.128
And in this way they forced me to sell it to Metz, to the university library of Metz, because they said he won't be able to

07:33.648 --> 07:43.644
to leave this here for three years and perhaps even incur a risk of not having it available for another five years.

07:44.425 --> 07:47.750
So I sold it at cost price to the library of maths.

07:47.850 --> 07:53.699
And it was just, how do you call it, ransom?

07:54.681 --> 07:58.727
I'm amazed they came up with three million francs though.

07:59.028 --> 08:23.685
well after six months or so and and with the help of the of the commune lorraine and and of they made it a course that was just wonderful that was just wonderful

08:24.610 --> 08:34.179
So the French are the only people who just dare to do that.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.201
Why do you think?

08:36.681 --> 08:44.329
They have a different understanding of the role of the state.

08:44.609 --> 08:53.217
I mean, the English or the German or the United States, they refrain

08:54.547 --> 09:23.625
themselves and also the state refrains itself to the really essential things but the French try to to do everything you know and try to to cover everything and so I'm please don't write this but so I'm I'm forced to

09:24.145 --> 09:27.508
to smuggle out manuscripts.

09:27.929 --> 09:32.954
Really, I mean, because otherwise... Or I tell them, you have to bring it to Switzerland.

09:34.936 --> 09:36.518
I buy it in Switzerland.

09:36.538 --> 09:37.439
Well, that's not illegal.

09:38.280 --> 09:43.445
No, it's not illegal, but I mean, I would prefer to do it legally, you know?

09:43.465 --> 09:49.471
I mean, buy it in Paris or buy it in... Don't do it out front, as they say, without having to... Yeah.

09:50.072 --> 09:53.055
To reduce yourself to... Yeah, yeah.

09:54.183 --> 09:55.725
Deception, I guess, is the word.

09:55.745 --> 10:01.254
But France is the only country in which I am forced to do these things.

10:02.236 --> 10:03.618
The only country.

10:04.820 --> 10:15.597
But one has to say that they have, of course, lots of verified things and of unheard things still around France.

10:15.617 --> 10:16.859
In private hands.

10:16.879 --> 10:17.440
In private hands.

10:17.774 --> 10:24.141
Next year I shall be attending the Biennale because they invited me.

10:25.883 --> 10:28.726
They invited me for six years now.

10:29.367 --> 10:40.980
But I always feared being there for three weeks from 11 in the morning to 11 in the night.

10:41.686 --> 10:59.130
practically alone, because my secretary in Germany doesn't speak French, and Mr. Cordes, who collected you at the station, doesn't speak French either.

11:01.052 --> 11:08.402
And Helga, my wife, can't accompany me for more than two or three days.

11:08.635 --> 11:21.016
So I always feared that, but I think I have to do that, because the French, on the other hand, they are the most book-loving people in the world.

11:21.677 --> 11:22.037
They are.

11:22.578 --> 11:23.900
They really are.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.805
And I always wanted to be one of them.

11:27.006 --> 11:33.276
And perhaps that combination, you know, of French...

11:33.492 --> 11:44.969
sense of bibliophilia and of a certain German matter of factness has helped me, perhaps.

11:46.271 --> 11:48.575
Would you say that your clients are all over the world?

11:49.416 --> 11:52.000
Any place in particular where they tend to predominate?

11:52.100 --> 11:57.909
Yes, but Europe predominates, by far.

11:58.409 --> 12:01.474
Interestingly, I never found

12:02.264 --> 12:07.690
a decent entrance to the American market.

12:07.710 --> 12:12.234
But this depends, I mean, it's my fault.

12:12.254 --> 12:20.883
It depends on my being somewhat shy against American people, you know.

12:20.903 --> 12:31.174
I mean, I see lots of them at Maastricht and at the great TFA fair or at Basel or in Munich or wherever I am.

12:32.504 --> 13:02.511
I have some difficulties with the American people and it is not surprising that the two or three people in America with whom I have more closer relationships they are former Europeans so I'm really a bit

13:03.082 --> 13:23.614
I'm a bit sad about that because America or the United States, it's really, it could be the promised land for also this vision of book culture that we too discussed.

13:24.115 --> 13:27.300
It could be the promised land for that because there are

13:27.770 --> 13:42.173
hundreds of thousands of people who are waiting for this.

13:42.633 --> 13:51.347
This was one of my reasons to welcome your letter.

13:52.068 --> 13:54.452
The first, second that I...

13:54.787 --> 14:22.093
received it because I really think that one has to do that and in the most pertinent way in the most pertinent manner and then perhaps this great land will in the one percent that really is

14:22.867 --> 14:35.979
is responsible for the tendencies and for the trends and so on, then it could really be leading in the world, also in this field.

14:37.360 --> 14:45.408
Until now, I think that Europe is still holding its... And within Europe, of course, it's all over.

14:45.648 --> 14:47.130
Western Europe, I would think.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.030
Yeah, yeah, of course.

14:48.451 --> 14:49.752
And also Eastern Europe.

14:50.002 --> 14:55.976
But Eastern Europe, you know, is still suffering, still very much suffering from the communism.

14:55.996 --> 15:01.930
And they are just recovering now.

15:01.950 --> 15:04.796
It will take another 10 or 15 years.

15:05.358 --> 15:08.044
Even France has, what, 10% unemployment?

15:08.210 --> 15:09.512
Yeah.

15:09.552 --> 15:12.916
They don't like to talk about how much they're spending on this or that.

15:12.937 --> 15:13.197
No.

15:13.417 --> 15:17.843
I mean, the Germans are entirely different.

15:17.863 --> 15:19.626
Of course, they have the notification.

15:19.646 --> 15:20.527
Yeah, of course.

15:20.607 --> 15:28.137
I mean, you know, without having taken in the whole of East Germany, I mean, the wine is good.

15:28.618 --> 15:34.967
You know, this is really, I mean, this is one of the four or five greatest Burgundy wines in the world.

15:35.448 --> 15:36.529
Claude La Roche.

15:38.298 --> 15:51.403
And when I discovered that, I bought everything that could be had in Switzerland from this winery distributor.

15:51.944 --> 15:53.086
Straight from the winery?

15:53.366 --> 15:53.647
Yeah.

15:56.552 --> 15:58.095
Any particular year or...

15:58.328 --> 16:02.112
Well, this is 1991 and this is perfect now.

16:02.372 --> 16:03.774
You know, it's not a great year.

16:03.794 --> 16:09.320
1990 was a great year, but 1990 you can only drink in 2005.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.202
So we want it now.

16:12.443 --> 16:20.511
So 1991 is just perfect now as you smell and feel and taste.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.675
Well, yes.

16:24.436 --> 16:26.698
I just...

16:26.932 --> 16:39.605
Today I received a demand from a librarian at Duke University who wanted to... John Sharp?

16:39.625 --> 16:40.586
Yeah, John Sharp.

16:40.626 --> 16:41.688
John Sharp's in my book.

16:42.208 --> 16:42.508
Really?

16:42.549 --> 16:44.651
He's in the Bloomberg chapter, the book.

16:44.751 --> 16:49.396
Today he sent me his references and so on because he wants to work for me.

16:49.696 --> 16:50.157
Really?

16:50.277 --> 16:50.957
In America.

16:51.638 --> 16:52.419
What do you think of him?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.501
A lot of integrity.

16:54.781 --> 16:55.943
He's an interesting man.

16:55.963 --> 16:56.263
Yeah.

16:56.547 --> 16:59.395
He wrote a very good description on that Synaxarion.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.965
Read what he has to say in my book.

17:03.206 --> 17:04.750
I quote him at length.

17:05.312 --> 17:06.334
He's in the index.

17:06.415 --> 17:07.638
John Sharp.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.569
In fact, when I give my talks, I usually mention

17:12.106 --> 17:14.730
an incident that happened with him and the book thief.

17:15.151 --> 17:17.033
The book thief went up to him and confronted him.

17:18.015 --> 17:19.277
And it's a funny story.

17:19.317 --> 17:20.919
I mean, you'll read it in the book.

17:20.939 --> 17:21.800
No, no, no, I read it.

17:21.881 --> 17:23.082
That's John Sharp.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.608
That's John Sharp III at Duke University.

17:28.290 --> 17:32.917
He wants to leave Duke University and he wants to work for me.

17:33.057 --> 17:34.239
He has a fine reputation.

17:34.279 --> 17:35.601
I can't say I know him well.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.284
No, no, but I heard that.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.727
But also a man of integrity, and that counts for a lot.

17:39.948 --> 17:41.149
It's your couple.

17:41.169 --> 17:41.590
I mean...

17:42.025 --> 17:43.307
Well, I meet him.

17:43.327 --> 17:54.164
Oh, by the way, will you be at that inauguration at the Morgan Library at the 20th of October?

17:54.665 --> 17:55.346
I shall be there.

17:56.408 --> 18:00.895
They invited me because I'm a fellow of the Morgan Library.

18:01.195 --> 18:04.640
And there's also that exhibition of medieval bestsellers.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.762
I'll try to make it down.

18:05.922 --> 18:09.488
I don't know about it.

18:09.648 --> 18:21.366
This was one of the most interesting, most important, most revealing points about these.

18:21.446 --> 18:27.135
No, this was really a fine piece of detective work, really.

18:27.155 --> 18:27.996
I have said...

18:28.432 --> 18:36.680
before the book came out, I said, this chapter will cause people to read this book a hundred years from now.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.981
Yeah, exactly.

18:38.201 --> 18:43.746
Because this is unique in the history of book collecting, and it's certainly unique to the 1980s and to this part of it.

18:43.766 --> 18:52.915
And to discover the very simple and even more.

18:53.455 --> 18:56.138
I bought the Dante first edition.

18:56.158 --> 18:57.319
You bought the Dante?

18:57.559 --> 18:58.320
Yeah, and these things.

18:58.537 --> 19:02.183
I bought Wolfram von Eschenbach and these things.

19:02.523 --> 19:06.610
You want some cheese?

19:06.950 --> 19:08.953
I'd like a little coffee I think would be good.

19:09.074 --> 19:10.516
And a sort of dessert.

19:11.257 --> 19:13.561
Something light.

19:14.061 --> 19:15.964
Something light.

19:18.348 --> 19:24.738
So I was there.

19:24.758 --> 19:25.860
I came there.

19:26.127 --> 19:29.051
for the first time of my life to the United States.

19:29.852 --> 19:31.294
That's your first trip?

19:31.314 --> 19:33.537
It was my first trip, yeah.

19:33.557 --> 19:49.880
And I had bad luck because my Concorde from Paris came to New York in time, but the JFK was foggy, so we had to go to Boston.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.462
On the Concorde, that never happened.

19:51.482 --> 19:55.948
On the Concorde, and in Boston they were...

19:56.620 --> 20:00.285
practically not allowed to land there.

20:00.665 --> 20:05.631
But we landed there and we stayed there for two hours and then we started again.

20:05.671 --> 20:13.601
And then I was in New York after eight hours after I left Paris instead of two and a half.

20:14.282 --> 20:17.987
And I wanted to inspect the books, I wanted to see the books.

20:18.524 --> 20:22.871
And it was the very day of the sale because I'm always doing this.

20:23.813 --> 20:31.505
Either I do it on telephone or I come the very day of the sale and see the most important books and then I make my decisions.

20:31.806 --> 20:35.071
So I was not able to see any book.

20:35.913 --> 20:43.485
This was a pity because though I was the underbidder on say 30 or 40 of the most important books,

20:43.600 --> 20:50.846
I only managed to buy, well, 15 to 20 books, but some very important.

20:50.866 --> 21:01.996
The Juditio Principes of Dante, as I said, and Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parzival, and Titerell, and so on.

21:02.196 --> 21:07.300
And I also bought the Rilke Manuscript, which will be in my next catalog.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.501
So you still have that?

21:08.661 --> 21:13.185
Yeah, and I bought the Eschenlin Dante on Vellum,

21:14.009 --> 21:15.011
and so on.

21:15.031 --> 21:27.175
So I bought the whole range from the 15th to the 20th century but as I was not able to collate and to see the books I was perhaps not so courageous as I would have been

21:27.610 --> 21:37.445
had I landed there in time, you know, and seen the stuff in Boston.

21:37.705 --> 21:41.050
For those kinds of numbers you have to know what you're doing.

21:41.150 --> 21:42.472
Yeah, of course.

21:43.834 --> 21:52.167
I bought for about two million dollars or so.

21:52.585 --> 21:54.868
The Cervantes shocked everybody.

21:55.109 --> 21:59.535
Yes, but I know this story, you know, but I won't tell you.

21:59.555 --> 22:09.250
But I know these stories, the Shakespeare and the Cervantes, these are, these are, these are mean stories, I have to tell you.

22:09.290 --> 22:12.695
I'll turn off the tape recorder, I'd love it.

22:12.715 --> 22:20.466
No, no, yeah, no, but I have to tell you that this sale, it was a very important, it was a very important sale.

22:20.885 --> 22:28.537
Though in two deals I made a huge figure than the whole sale.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.862
But nevertheless it was a very important sale.

22:32.062 --> 22:44.040
But what I have to say is that many of my colleagues, many of my fellow dealers really tried to make most of the sale

22:44.273 --> 22:50.882
on detriment of their clients.

22:51.462 --> 22:53.084
It's a pity to say that.

22:53.625 --> 23:00.815
And I know so many things of these and this is why prices went through the roof.

23:00.835 --> 23:08.104
They just went wild because there was one client of mine who

23:08.472 --> 23:18.962
first of all because he knew that I would never go to the United States, entrusted his bids to two other world leading firms.

23:18.982 --> 23:19.882
Won't tell you.

23:20.443 --> 23:22.645
Well, Quaritch bought everything.

23:22.665 --> 23:27.109
Yeah, Quaritch and one other American firm.

23:27.329 --> 23:35.136
And then I told... But they had their class.

23:35.237 --> 23:36.057
Cross about a lot.

23:36.077 --> 23:36.738
Cross, yeah.

23:37.198 --> 23:37.939
So...

23:38.577 --> 23:42.742
But then I told him, I will be there.

23:43.262 --> 23:54.935
And then the evening before the sale, he changed his mind and wanted to give me all his bids.

23:54.995 --> 24:03.004
And I said to him, well, you know, as you know, I don't take any commissions, but for you, I would take them.

24:03.144 --> 24:04.686
You don't take commissions?

24:05.020 --> 24:06.507
Normally I don't take commissions.

24:06.527 --> 24:13.157
I want to buy the books and I want to make... Let the books take care of themselves.

24:13.475 --> 24:15.819
So you're really not, you're buying for yourself.

24:15.939 --> 24:18.764
I'm always, 99.9%, I'm buying for myself.

24:18.804 --> 24:20.367
I'm buying for stock.

24:20.788 --> 24:22.391
We haven't said that before.

24:22.411 --> 24:25.496
No, no, well, I mean, there are many things that I haven't said before.

24:25.516 --> 24:27.019
That's very interesting, you see.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.223
I'm never buying for others.

24:29.383 --> 24:33.550
Of course, there aren't many booksellers who can afford to do that.

24:33.570 --> 24:37.457
I'm perhaps the only bookseller in the world who is always buying for himself.

24:37.943 --> 24:42.690
and who is not buying together in a consortium.

24:42.710 --> 24:50.723
So I told him, in this very special case, I accept your commissions.

24:51.804 --> 24:56.171
And he said, OK, I just have to tell this one and this one that you get the commissions.

24:56.852 --> 24:59.316
And they went furious, of course.

24:59.396 --> 25:06.347
They went wild when they heard that, because these commissions were the most substantial of all.

25:07.255 --> 25:13.121
among two or three most substantive feminists.

25:13.141 --> 25:16.964
And so they really frightened him.

25:16.984 --> 25:20.648
And I said, well, let them have it.

25:20.668 --> 25:22.890
You just tell me what you want to have.

25:23.791 --> 25:31.418
And in the cases that I do not want books, they shall have it.

25:31.758 --> 25:33.160
Otherwise, I try to get them.

25:34.281 --> 25:35.642
I told him, frankly.

25:36.533 --> 25:40.819
And so I got the gun tail and other things that he also wanted to have.

25:41.841 --> 25:50.033
But I afterwards learned what they had done.

25:50.274 --> 25:58.386
I mean, this is really, I mean, it is not worth of the renown of such films.

25:58.406 --> 25:59.788
Really, it's not worth.

25:59.808 --> 26:05.697
I mean, they told Sotheby's, we have commissions up to that.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.104
point up to that... The reserve?

26:10.006 --> 26:11.888
No, no, no.

26:12.249 --> 26:13.851
Ten times the reserve or so.

26:14.492 --> 26:17.897
Just see to that.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.322
We do not get it much below that.

26:23.245 --> 26:35.903
I mean, this is... Well, the sail was very heated and it was a boiling affair and the taxi driver, because it was the very day that the Berlin Wall

26:36.355 --> 26:37.397
was falling, you know.

26:38.037 --> 26:40.541
He said to me, what the hell are you doing here?

26:40.601 --> 26:44.006
Because he heard that I was talking German to my friend.

26:46.510 --> 26:51.137
And all in all, it was just an overwhelming thing.

26:51.237 --> 27:05.097
But what the most serious and the most renowned of my colleagues have done at this sale, this is really appalling, to say the least.

27:06.123 --> 27:35.522
another temptation another temptation yeah yeah yeah so there's your espresso thank you you know I think it's always I think it's always interesting to to see it from from a different side see it from the other side the same thing you just told me nobody would ever have told me before no of course not of course not because

27:35.688 --> 27:40.916
Because it's not what we call a rumusblatt, you know, a piece of honor.

27:42.057 --> 27:44.321
Why would they do that, just to get a higher commission?

27:44.341 --> 27:44.882
Of course.

27:45.342 --> 27:55.818
But it depends on the fact that most of these antiquarian booksellers live on commissions.

27:56.319 --> 28:03.349
They don't buy anything for themselves, only if they get it at a fraction, at the value of the thing.

28:03.903 --> 28:08.910
But how can they still manage to run up the price stock, unless it's a conspiracy between two dealers?

28:11.353 --> 28:21.227
How can they manage to spend... If you tell Sotheby's we have a commission up to that sum... So he'll see a bid when there maybe isn't one there?

28:23.610 --> 28:28.797
Let's imagine one item.

28:29.698 --> 28:33.724
The item is estimated at $100,000.

28:33.907 --> 28:37.971
a bid from a client up to $450,000.

28:38.371 --> 28:43.597
You just tell it in the bosom of Sotheby's.

28:43.617 --> 28:47.601
You just place it in the bosom of Sotheby's.

28:47.841 --> 28:52.245
And you say, well, we have a very substantial bid.

28:52.806 --> 28:54.748
And they say, well, very substantial.

28:54.928 --> 28:56.449
Over our estimate.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.612
Well, four times our estimate.

28:59.092 --> 29:03.036
So you can swear

29:03.421 --> 29:10.471
that Sotheby's will just bid you against the chandelier, you know, up to $380,000.

29:10.751 --> 29:14.937
If they know, why not?

29:14.957 --> 29:16.880
I know they did that in the Dick Manning sale.

29:17.561 --> 29:18.963
Yeah, in the Manning sale, of course.

29:18.983 --> 29:22.007
When the Shakespeare's came up, there was nobody in the form.

29:22.187 --> 29:24.010
No one, no one.

29:24.030 --> 29:32.061
He finally bought it in for $600,000, and I'm standing there, I happen to be standing next to Stephen Massey, and I said, who the hell is bidding?

29:32.429 --> 29:33.250
I said, who's bidding?

29:33.671 --> 29:34.452
He says, do you see?

29:34.592 --> 29:36.975
Of course, he's Christie's, and this is Sotheby's.

29:37.055 --> 29:38.417
He says, do you see anybody bidding?

29:38.938 --> 29:39.278
I said, no.

29:39.318 --> 29:42.362
He said, well, that's because there isn't anybody bidding.

29:42.382 --> 29:44.545
He said, that's the answer right there.

29:44.885 --> 29:50.293
But they certainly couldn't let the thing be bought in for $500,000 when they put a million and a half on it.

29:50.393 --> 29:52.035
No, they do that.

29:53.557 --> 30:00.546
But talking of Christie's, I mean, they wanted me to buy that Blonde Chronique printed on vellum,

30:01.049 --> 30:30.718
four years ago and I was the only I was the only client to buy such a thing for say half a million pounds or so and that you bought for stock too no I went there and I said well you know it's times are hard it's 1993 and they were hard I have to tell you

30:31.593 --> 30:35.437
In 1993, I lost my three best customers.

30:36.258 --> 30:38.521
All three within three months.

30:38.961 --> 30:39.742
My best customers.

30:41.384 --> 30:42.045
Diseased?

30:43.306 --> 30:43.907
You mean they died?

30:44.348 --> 30:46.530
Well, one died of suicide.

30:49.033 --> 30:55.120
The other went to prison on tax reasons.

30:56.161 --> 31:01.127
And the third one got troubles with the bank.

31:03.318 --> 31:09.827
This Alsatian Tarte Tatin is really good.

31:10.447 --> 31:16.916
So, I went to Felix Hoyens and said, I'd like to have that.

31:20.361 --> 31:24.586
What is the reserve?

31:24.606 --> 31:32.076
And he said, well, the reserve, initially we thought the reserve is 300,000 pounds, but now

31:32.427 --> 31:35.591
The reserve has been up to £500,000.

31:35.691 --> 31:37.433
Yeah, £450,000.

31:38.094 --> 31:42.620
And I said, okay, help me.

31:43.681 --> 31:51.872
Not that I'm very short of money, but I would like to get some terms.

31:52.753 --> 31:54.596
I'm thinking of six months or so.

31:56.258 --> 31:59.422
30, 60, 90, 120 and so on.

31:59.822 --> 32:00.443
Up to 180.

32:00.997 --> 32:25.174
And he said, okay, okay, come with me to my office and we just sign a thing that you get by buying it above 450,000 pounds that you get payment terms over six months.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.477
And I said, okay.

32:27.980 --> 32:35.450
And then the day of the sale, next day came and I was there and I was the only one to bid from £250,000 on.

32:35.931 --> 32:45.663
And I said to myself, what am I doing here?

32:45.884 --> 32:46.845
Who are you bidding against?

32:47.786 --> 32:49.228
Only against the chandelier.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.932
So did you pull out at some point?

32:51.972 --> 32:52.192
No.

32:52.913 --> 32:54.315
I went up to £450,000.

32:54.856 --> 32:57.379
And then...

32:58.085 --> 32:59.787
See, that's nasty, isn't it?

32:59.947 --> 33:01.388
It is more than nasty.

33:01.709 --> 33:03.110
It's criminal, actually.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.111
Of course.

33:04.331 --> 33:04.732
But wait.

33:05.412 --> 33:13.300
And then Lord Hindlip, you know, he tried another $460,000, and then I let them stay there.

33:14.041 --> 33:15.322
And he said, $462,000.

33:15.362 --> 33:20.247
And I said, no, no, thank you.

33:20.287 --> 33:22.149
That's it, you backed up.

33:22.269 --> 33:23.751
So it went back.

33:23.811 --> 33:25.813
But they were lucky they got somebody to come in, though.

33:26.890 --> 33:28.492
What would they have done if you let it go?

33:28.812 --> 33:32.937
They just... They would have... They would have said, bought it in.

33:32.957 --> 33:33.438
Yeah, of course.

33:34.720 --> 33:41.488
And, and, um, Predix Orian did not believe his ears when he, when he heard, uh, Hindlip say 460.

33:42.349 --> 33:48.416
Because I, I went up to my, to my limit, you know, up to my, uh, optimum, maximum.

33:48.436 --> 33:50.179
So you, you impose limits on yourself?

33:51.981 --> 33:53.222
Yeah.

33:53.242 --> 33:53.843
And, uh,

33:54.430 --> 34:00.317
Well, afterwards I was quite delighted because normally I should have had it at 250,000 or so.

34:00.337 --> 34:06.205
They played games.

34:06.225 --> 34:08.407
Yeah, but not with me, you know.

34:09.348 --> 34:20.182
I mean, I went through hundreds, literally hundreds of options in the last 20 years, perhaps thousands.

34:22.184 --> 34:24.387
No one will play games with me.

34:24.704 --> 34:26.266
No one.

34:26.286 --> 34:42.805
I mean I bought the Biblia pauperum in 1986 and I was chased up by two not so honest people whom I know by name.

34:43.866 --> 34:46.870
But I mean one learns.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.277
Today

34:53.695 --> 34:57.704
I normally do not even go to the auction sales.

34:58.606 --> 35:07.506
Either I'm there via the telephone or I send someone there so that no one knows that it's me behind this one.

35:08.629 --> 35:12.177
This is good because sometimes I get the books at

35:12.545 --> 35:16.250
half the price that I would have to pay if I'm there in person.

35:16.330 --> 35:19.274
Because I'm sure that there are people who will run you up just out of spite.

35:19.355 --> 35:38.221
Of course, of course, of course, because if they say that I'm, if they see that I'm bidding, they just say to themselves, well, there must be something behind, and let's try, or let's just keep something.

35:38.401 --> 35:42.467
No, I think at your level,

35:43.274 --> 35:45.497
It doesn't do you any good to go in?

35:45.918 --> 35:46.979
No, no, no.

35:46.999 --> 35:55.290
So I haven't been to the London sales in the last three years for more than two or three times.

35:55.971 --> 36:01.599
I was at the back sale because I was... You could go with an associate and have the associate bid for you.

36:01.739 --> 36:02.239
Of course.

36:02.340 --> 36:05.484
No, no, this is no problem.

36:05.604 --> 36:08.708
And do you have a paddle number at all these places?

36:08.907 --> 36:12.230
Well, normally I don't have a pedal number because they all know me.

36:15.834 --> 36:22.681
But now they want all of us to have also a pedal number.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.422
I, of course, have a pedal number.

36:25.103 --> 36:29.748
And if I buy more at sales, they say, may I have your pedal number?

36:29.768 --> 36:34.172
But normally it's just my name.

36:35.047 --> 36:43.558
As I told you, I'm fortunate enough to get most of the important things offered privately.

36:44.119 --> 36:48.044
And this is really... It's cleaner, it's neater.

36:48.064 --> 36:49.225
Yeah, of course.

36:50.347 --> 37:02.162
Because as you see, I mean, as with the garden sale or with other sales, I mean, I could tell you stories about nearly every important sale in the last 10 or 15 years.

37:03.764 --> 37:04.345
And...

37:04.679 --> 37:07.622
And most of the stories are not so very proper.

37:08.423 --> 37:11.125
We have time, I think.

37:11.426 --> 37:30.664
Do you realize we've already got three hours of tape and we haven't even done tomorrow yet?

37:31.585 --> 37:32.026
That's great.

37:32.346 --> 37:34.568
The more the better.

37:34.970 --> 37:38.535
Believe me, it's magnificent stuff.

37:38.555 --> 37:41.961
I think it's good to have as much stuff as possible.

37:41.981 --> 37:45.386
Pardon me for calling it stuff, but it's material.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.669
And I transcribe these things.

37:47.689 --> 37:48.451
Really, of course.

37:48.931 --> 37:51.996
You really have to do that, because one cannot keep that in mind.

37:52.016 --> 37:52.817
And I do it myself.

37:53.038 --> 37:56.323
You know how you do your catalogs?

37:56.683 --> 37:58.506
I could hire somebody to do the transcripts.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.209
No, no, one has to do it oneself.

38:00.229 --> 38:03.053
Because you hear it yourself, there are nuances that you...

38:03.657 --> 38:04.778
that you're never going to pick up.

38:05.579 --> 38:08.443
And then you're able to hear it again too.

38:10.626 --> 38:11.026
Wonderful.

38:11.867 --> 38:28.348
I think that in a certain way we have gotten back a sort of predominance in the antiquarian book selling and book dealing.

38:28.818 --> 38:40.313
from the United States, because in the 60s and in the 70s, and even in the 80s, the United States were predominant.

38:40.453 --> 38:41.795
They were overwhelming.

38:41.815 --> 38:51.207
I mean, LDF, Lou David Feldman, who I worry about, H.P.

38:51.227 --> 38:57.475
Krauss and Breslauer, though he's, of course, he's a German Jew, too.

38:57.725 --> 39:20.391
turned english and then he went in the early 70s he went to new york they were a real force in the field and there were not many to to even try to fight against them let alone to

39:24.573 --> 39:37.025
In your view, in your mind, is there a tradition of European book selling, which kind of brings a scholarly vent?

39:38.206 --> 39:40.328
Yes, that exists, really.

39:40.388 --> 39:44.452
It's something I'm trying to get at.

39:44.873 --> 39:46.915
Yeah, but I'm sorry to say this.

39:47.535 --> 39:50.378
It is not the

39:50.527 --> 39:57.035
Anglo-Saxon tradition, it is more the French and the German tradition.

39:57.055 --> 40:04.966
The German tradition was always a tradition of scholarly confidence.

40:05.526 --> 40:20.145
I mean Jacques Rosenthal or Leo Baer or Carl Hirseman, those were very important scholarly trained booksellers in the great tradition.

40:20.800 --> 40:32.652
and they made the best catalogs and they established the most lasting traditions in the first half of the 20th century.

40:33.693 --> 40:48.529
Jack Rosenthal and his elder brother Ludwig Rosenthal and Emil Hirsch and Carl Hirseman, Martin Breslauer, the father of Bernard Breslauer and Leo Baer

40:48.914 --> 40:51.097
But most of them were Jewish, you know.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.421
And so in the 30s they came to the United States.

40:54.601 --> 41:02.751
Nearly everyone came either to the United States or to England or they died as Jacques Rosenthal.

41:02.831 --> 41:12.443
And they even did not, the Nazi did not dare to touch him, you know, because he was world famous, Jacques Rosenthal.

41:12.463 --> 41:14.145
So he died in 1936.

41:14.952 --> 41:19.879
I'm seeing Edith Rosenthal next week in Amsterdam, and she's going to tell me about that.

41:20.159 --> 41:21.881
And I've already talked to Bernie.

41:22.162 --> 41:37.803
Well, Bernie, you know, wrote about the... Of course, about the family, the emigrant books, and so on, because the Rosenthal were also married to the Olskis and so on.

41:37.983 --> 41:41.348
Well, this may be a fascinating story.

41:41.530 --> 42:11.520
and really I see that this German tradition in a certain way I'm trying to keep up because you know what they did in their time we tried to do in our time with a much more scholarly impact but what they did in their time was well it was

42:11.905 --> 42:14.351
the most that they could do.

42:14.472 --> 42:16.657
Do you know Roger Stoddard at Harvard?

42:17.319 --> 42:22.492
No, I never met him, but of course I know his name.

42:23.836 --> 42:28.969
He's of the opinion that so many of these Jewish booksellers who left

42:29.371 --> 42:33.678
really affected the whole flow of books for a generation.

42:33.738 --> 42:36.463
Without any doubt, Nicholas, without any doubt.

42:36.543 --> 42:39.808
I mean, really it was the Jewish booksellers who did that.

42:39.888 --> 42:47.320
If you were to look at the experiences of at least 50 or 40 or 50 booksellers who came really with their knowledge.

42:48.122 --> 42:49.624
By the way, I mean quarry.

42:49.756 --> 42:50.837
Max.

42:51.478 --> 42:54.321
These all were Jewish of origin.

42:54.601 --> 42:58.305
They were German, but they were Jewish.

42:58.345 --> 43:03.670
And what we are trying now is to keep up with that tradition.

43:04.030 --> 43:14.281
In fact, Roger does believe, though, that primarily led by yourself, that the German tradition has reversed.

43:14.341 --> 43:15.001
Of course.

43:15.141 --> 43:17.704
And that you are, once again, preeminent

43:18.258 --> 43:20.260
Oh, by me, no.

43:20.480 --> 43:24.904
Well, I mean, in terms of doing significant things?

43:25.325 --> 43:27.547
Yeah, I wanted to do that, you know.

43:27.647 --> 43:35.154
I wanted to pick up a tradition forgotten for 50 or 60 years.

43:35.594 --> 43:43.121
Because, you know, after the Second World War, no one in Germany was dealing in manuscripts.

43:43.702 --> 43:44.923
No one.

43:45.680 --> 43:51.726
In 1983 or 1982, I was the first to pick up that thread.

43:52.086 --> 43:52.747
Really?

43:52.767 --> 43:57.792
No, that had been laid by the Rosenthal's and by Leo Baer.

43:58.452 --> 43:59.093
I was the first.

43:59.453 --> 44:06.140
Of course, there were manuscripts, but invariably they were picked up by Krauss and so on.

44:06.740 --> 44:09.243
Ja, hallo, mein lieber.

44:09.263 --> 44:11.485
Ich höre, Sie sind krank.

44:11.505 --> 44:12.466
Ja, du, mein lieber.

44:12.486 --> 44:12.666
Was?

44:12.882 --> 44:39.632
Jewish, I mean, but it was always my intention to pick up that thread that, as I said, was falling in the early 30s, because virtually the great German antiquarian booksellers were 90 to 95% of Jewish origin, though there were

44:40.017 --> 44:44.725
assimilated Jews but they were Jewish and so they had to leave.

44:45.447 --> 44:56.266
And of course many of the second or third-rate librarians took over and made the most of it and took their profit from this.

44:56.967 --> 45:04.540
But in the 50s, 60s and 70s the antiquarian book trade in Germany suffered

45:05.380 --> 45:35.100
still from that loss and even in the 80s they did not recover and then I tried to maintain the tradition of haute bibliophilie you must have perceived an opportunity yes there was no one there I did I did or I at least hoped that there was this opportunity you know and in a certain way I succeeded also in this field

45:35.620 --> 45:50.458
Meanwhile, there are two or three booksellers in Europe who try to follow these paths.

45:50.979 --> 45:53.302
I think it's good to do this.

45:53.362 --> 45:57.647
Do you see any competition to yourself out there?

45:57.667 --> 46:04.395
Well, of course there are competitors, but I don't see any serious competition.

46:04.645 --> 46:27.999
because I mean most of my fellows they have ten or fifteen manuscripts and most of them belong to three or four or five parties you know and they make the tour of the catalogs of the four or five or six and they belong to six or seven parties.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.205
Which brings me to an interesting question and I hope it's not

46:32.455 --> 46:37.201
you take it in the spirit within which it's asked, but how important is capital in this equation?

46:37.401 --> 46:39.804
Well, I mean, yeah, this is a good question.

46:41.105 --> 47:00.488
I have two good bankers, you know, because sometimes, even if you're just on the point of publishing a new catalogue, after which you sell lots or at least some of the things and have the capital again,

47:01.143 --> 47:07.850
If you are offered in this situation a very important thing, you have to buy it, of course.

47:08.190 --> 47:16.198
And to go to your banker and say, well, I need another two or three million Swiss francs or two or three million Deutsche Mark.

47:18.080 --> 47:26.408
If they are not very sympathetic with what you do, you don't get the money, of course.

47:27.721 --> 47:31.726
But do you have to explain to them in bibliographical terms the significance of it?

47:31.766 --> 47:32.487
No, no, no, no.

47:32.828 --> 47:44.203
I persuaded them in banker terms, you know, because I never told them what I could not make true, you know.

47:44.223 --> 47:55.939
I mean, I never told them anything that did not arrive in time, you know.

47:56.273 --> 48:01.601
I told them, I shall get this and this, then and then.

48:01.661 --> 48:09.233
And it always... Yeah, but then you do buy things that you've had for ten years.

48:10.595 --> 48:22.433
Well, but I mean, this is of course a part of my success, that these things do not cost me...

48:23.054 --> 48:26.778
at all, you know, because I made the profit on other things.

48:27.719 --> 48:43.397
And if I now sell a book bought ten years ago for say one million dollars or so, well this is my profit, this is sheer profit because I made the money I needed for that.

48:45.239 --> 48:50.665
So you have to imagine that

48:50.932 --> 48:59.766
of all my books and of all my manuscripts only say, well, 8% belong to my bank.

49:02.250 --> 49:16.433
This is okay because in the art trade, I have to tell you, it is ordinary that 50% or 60% or even 70% belong to your bank.

49:16.666 --> 49:46.302
and with me it's only below 10% and as you said you have to have a good opinion and they know that everything is true what I say to them you know and having having having seen and having recognized this for 20 years now or for 15 years here they know that I'm never lying that

49:46.484 --> 49:49.368
I will never lie to them.

49:49.428 --> 49:53.333
Of course, I mean, yes, but... No, no, no.

49:54.014 --> 49:55.216
I'm very cautious.

49:55.396 --> 49:56.477
I'm very cautious, you know.

49:56.938 --> 50:15.242
Because I know if one time something that I tell them will not be... will be belied by the time...

50:15.847 --> 50:17.569
they say, well, this can happen.

50:17.910 --> 50:23.978
But the second time, they will cancel parts of my credit.

50:24.439 --> 50:28.564
And this, I can't afford this.

50:28.745 --> 50:31.028
And it never happened.

50:31.048 --> 50:42.283
And even in the most difficult times, the times in 1993, 1994, they were really difficult, not only for me, for all of us.

50:43.024 --> 50:45.027
But for me, especially because I

50:45.260 --> 50:59.494
had bought the Bibermühle and two large libraries and so on and so on, and we were talking of tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars, even then they stuck to me.

51:02.257 --> 51:06.281
I'm very grateful to them.

51:06.401 --> 51:10.305
And so they are to me.

51:12.732 --> 51:15.176
Okay, Nicholas.

51:15.537 --> 51:16.358
What keeps you going?

51:17.360 --> 51:38.554
This tension of the things lying in the future and maybe present tomorrow or in a week or so that I may discover in a month things that you would have thought burnt in the Second World War or

51:39.530 --> 52:09.182
gone to international libraries since a hundred years or so all these discoveries and all these hopes are what make my profession the finest the most beautiful and the most promising profession in the world and you make these discoveries you're invited into a house and you're invited to look at things yeah and nobody even do they give you an idea of what's there are you just

52:09.685 --> 52:11.767
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

52:11.787 --> 52:18.714
Most of the times, either they know nothing at all, or they know exactly what they have.

52:18.734 --> 52:34.630
Normally, if they know nothing at all, I come to their house and I tell them, and I run the risk that after they have discovered that things are worth a hundred times more than they have thought they were,

52:34.964 --> 53:04.077
that they go to solubries or to christmas but normally they don't because they think that I'm honest and in 80 or 90 percent I then get them or they know exactly what they have and then come with me you know they come to me and offer me their things and then disappointments are inevitable because to know what you have and to evaluate

53:04.462 --> 53:11.010
this item or these items exactly is a very different thing, of course.

53:11.070 --> 53:17.858
And how often do you run into things that you had no idea existed before?

53:18.559 --> 53:20.301
Well, does that happen?

53:20.661 --> 53:26.248
Yes, that happens, say, eight to ten times a year.

53:27.109 --> 53:32.595
But we are talking of very important things.

53:33.622 --> 53:42.718
One could raise that to, say, 20 times a year.

53:43.340 --> 53:48.749
And this is much for a one-person company like me.

53:49.130 --> 53:50.452
And you are a one-person company.

53:50.472 --> 53:51.695
I'm a one-person company.

53:51.755 --> 53:53.237
Very modest staff, right?

53:53.257 --> 53:53.919
Your wife works.

53:54.019 --> 53:58.026
At this very moment, I don't even have a secretary.

53:58.090 --> 54:10.483
Because, of course, to be my secretary, this is a sort of... It's not very easy.

54:11.324 --> 54:20.234
And I had a 22-year-old girl as secretary from February on.

54:20.394 --> 54:24.418
She was very handsome, but she had no...

54:24.888 --> 54:54.304
gifts whatsoever so I had to it was really too bad but so for three months now we don't even have a secretary but it's okay and we are making our catalogs and perhaps the officials in the Kantor Schaffhausen wait a month longer for being for the taxes to be paid and so on but

54:54.605 --> 55:07.601
Even that does not avoid the marching on of our business.

55:07.621 --> 55:08.963
So you're really a one person?

55:09.283 --> 55:11.126
Yes, one person.

55:11.266 --> 55:21.118
As I told you, I have a scholarly advisor, Eberhard Koenig, professor at the Free University of Berlin.

55:21.385 --> 55:27.091
who is a very good friend and who writes most of my manuscript catalogs.

55:28.312 --> 55:48.692
But apart from that, I'm the only one who does all the work in the business because my wife is busy with our two children, 12 and 14 years old, and with those two modest houses that you have seen.

55:50.427 --> 56:01.805
And you have an assistant, but he handles the... Well, I have an assistant who lives in Hamburg and who comes for one week a month to help me.

56:02.166 --> 56:06.993
So, I mean, one cannot say that this is a regular employee.

56:07.074 --> 56:08.376
But you have another operation.

56:08.656 --> 56:10.419
You can't be two places at the same time.

56:10.439 --> 56:11.320
Yeah, exactly.

56:11.380 --> 56:16.789
And there's still Bavaria, my German company,

56:17.123 --> 56:21.389
So this has to be, and there is also a secretary, and she is just perfect.

56:21.409 --> 56:32.903
I mean, she's one of the most wonderful persons in the world, and without her, I would have stopped running that business in Germany for three or four years.

56:33.304 --> 56:35.687
But she's really more than helpful.

56:35.867 --> 56:41.815
She's my second, my right arm and my right leg, so to say.

56:42.132 --> 56:42.773
It's amazing.

56:43.454 --> 57:06.992
She's good and we like each other very much and the only thing that I really want to do is to bring her to Switzerland but as you know this is not so easy to get a German employee into my Swiss firm because the Swiss now are also

57:07.293 --> 57:23.108
thinking of suffering of their unemployment they have I think 4.5% unemployment but still they think this is this is rather dramatic and so they
