00:03.085 --> 00:16.337
I have some original documentary stuff, you know, on film, you know, and the posters you saw, and then artist conceptions and illustrations and all kinds of audio-visual material.

00:17.798 --> 00:23.464
Career for libraries is how to keep it, catalog it, and use it.

00:24.444 --> 00:30.070
But I see this as an integral part of the collection along with printed matter.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.772
And even though I respect printed matter more than I do film,

00:33.038 --> 00:39.247
and audio, it's all part of the writer's, either his life or his work.

00:39.267 --> 00:54.748
And adaptations, I have a lot of stuff on Faulkner adaptations, and I hope in the years to come I'll have a lot of stuff on the Israeli adaptations and things in television and reportage and things like that.

00:54.868 --> 00:58.233
I asked you yesterday, and you did, and I wanted you to tell me what you wanted to know.

00:58.253 --> 01:01.898
The Feldman catalogs, in the early years,

01:03.582 --> 01:14.076
as opposed to Marguerite Cohn and Henry Winning and John Cohn from Seven Gables tended to be a little more pricey items for recollection.

01:15.839 --> 01:25.772
So that I was getting Feldman catalogs without visiting Feldman because it was a little out of my reach.

01:25.792 --> 01:29.558
It was very early that I would rather acquire twenty five dollar books.

01:30.359 --> 01:30.699
Twenty?

01:30.980 --> 01:32.762
Five dollar books instead of

01:33.957 --> 01:37.943
five twenty five dollar books and up and down the line.

01:40.026 --> 01:57.771
That's what my wife and I used to discuss and she says I'm wrong I should get the hundred dollar book I can always come back and get the five dollar books and I said no it's not true but once I reach to a hundred it's easy to start buying hundred and two hundred dollar items and you know the old accent the first time you paid fifteen cents you said my god

01:58.409 --> 02:03.896
And I can't afford a 25, but the first time you paid 25, you found you could afford 25, and then you went to 40.

02:04.677 --> 02:07.100
So I was very disciplined in that.

02:07.120 --> 02:07.501
I still am.

02:08.582 --> 02:11.185
I thought of Feldman as being that kind of a seller.

02:11.866 --> 02:15.551
I didn't want to be that kind of a buyer.

02:15.711 --> 02:21.679
Based upon the catalogs that I either saw or was sent.

02:21.699 --> 02:28.167
I wasn't ready for Feldman, and maybe today I'm still not ready for Feldman.

02:28.187 --> 02:28.247
But

02:30.623 --> 02:47.708
In one of the later years, it may have been the last year he was a bookseller, I remember somehow calling him, or somebody contacted me that Feldman had some alia, impulsive.

02:47.729 --> 02:50.272
The least I could do was at least see it and then tell them.

02:51.454 --> 02:52.536
It's becoming a little clear now.

02:53.217 --> 02:56.542
At least inform them of what it is that I had seen.

02:58.024 --> 02:59.466
It's possible it was a scholar.

03:01.673 --> 03:10.564
wound up, we used to go to New York a lot, so I went to see him, and he knew where I was, and told me.

03:12.506 --> 03:13.367
I didn't know who you were.

03:15.030 --> 03:18.294
I was on his mailing list.

03:18.314 --> 03:22.499
It's possible I had bought an item from him somewhere in the past.

03:22.579 --> 03:24.241
I don't recall.

03:27.225 --> 03:31.630
I haven't shown this to too many people.

03:32.993 --> 03:35.376
active acquiring this material for sale.

03:36.397 --> 03:42.926
It has not been as yet consigned to me.

03:42.946 --> 03:43.967
It was family material.

03:44.227 --> 03:45.369
What do you think he was dealing with?

03:45.930 --> 03:51.016
It could have been Vicki, or it could have been Dean, or it could have been Louise, or it could have been... It wasn't Jill.

03:51.216 --> 03:53.459
It wasn't the wife.

03:53.479 --> 03:54.140
Well, Jill's the daughter.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.825
I mean, it wasn't Jill, but she was a legal heir, wasn't she?

03:57.845 --> 03:58.866
We still have that problem.

03:59.521 --> 04:01.003
that Jill was the trustee.

04:01.384 --> 04:07.111
I mean, you think maybe some of this stuff... It never acquired anything from any of the family, which is why I'm only with the family.

04:08.834 --> 04:16.624
By the time I was offered some books, which I thought were overpriced and I didn't need, from one of them.

04:17.245 --> 04:18.147
And I turned it down.

04:18.287 --> 04:21.952
Did he indicate to you that... Lou and Carl used to deal with the family.

04:25.216 --> 04:26.839
Did... Did... You mean Lou Brodsky or Lou Feltman?

04:26.859 --> 04:27.199
Feltman.

04:28.647 --> 04:33.314
Oh, Lou Brodsky and Carl dealt with the family.

04:33.334 --> 04:33.755
I didn't.

04:35.056 --> 04:39.984
Did Feldman indicate to you that there was a lot more where this came from?

04:40.004 --> 04:40.344
We have.

04:42.447 --> 04:48.216
It was my opinion that the whole drawer was the material, because there was a lot of stuff.

04:49.438 --> 04:55.887
The drawer was maybe this deep, and it was loaded, and it had the equivalent of the blue books.

04:56.761 --> 04:59.063
You know, the little books where you would write things?

05:00.445 --> 05:04.509
I found it terribly, terribly uninteresting to me.

05:05.550 --> 05:12.918
And I was very grateful that I was not being quoted individually on the individual items because we communicated.

05:12.938 --> 05:18.925
Feldman and I communicated that things were not priced individually and weren't even priced, period.

05:18.945 --> 05:21.808
Was he offering them to you or was he showing them to you?

05:21.828 --> 05:25.772
I think he was showing to me with the possibility that he would later offer them to me.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.146
at the appropriate time.

05:29.489 --> 05:31.371
I expressed no interest at all.

05:32.453 --> 05:37.439
I think I expressed no interest at all, which is why I was never contacted afterwards.

05:37.719 --> 05:40.923
I told him this was not my field of collecting.

05:42.024 --> 05:45.568
And I made up some little, this is wonderful, but I thought it was awful.

05:46.169 --> 05:51.696
I thought that the Faulkner Juvenalia was awful.

05:51.956 --> 05:53.998
Not this stuff.

05:54.599 --> 05:55.320
This wasn't

05:55.958 --> 05:56.539
stories.

05:58.061 --> 06:02.026
This was work done when he was in grade school.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.509
This was math and English.

06:04.549 --> 06:05.451
Were there any letters?

06:05.531 --> 06:06.512
Were there anything?

06:06.712 --> 06:07.614
I don't think so.

06:08.955 --> 06:16.525
What he showed me was juvenalia coming from schoolwork.

06:16.545 --> 06:18.768
That's the way I remember it, what he showed me.

06:19.129 --> 06:23.755
Maybe there was more material, but what he showed me and described it was what I just said to you.

06:24.697 --> 06:28.702
I don't know what Texas got, and I don't know how you understand what was there, but that's what I am.

06:28.722 --> 06:35.932
My understanding was that this came from Faulkner's school work and probably kept by his mother.

06:37.234 --> 06:39.938
And somehow when the mother died, it went on to somebody else.

06:41.059 --> 06:42.020
That's my impression.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.022
Okay.

06:43.042 --> 06:53.476
You think he was using you to set up a straw that, that's my word, not yours, but he could say to whomever, hey, look, I got a guy who's looking at this stuff.

06:53.556 --> 06:54.417
It's very possible.

06:56.438 --> 07:01.223
Do you have any impressions of the little felon that you can share with me?

07:01.383 --> 07:03.225
I only was with him a couple times.

07:03.786 --> 07:10.273
The fact that I didn't do any business with him sort of was the way I... It wasn't I was afraid of him.

07:10.313 --> 07:16.640
I thought it was a little pompous, and I thought that that was not the kind of a man that I could have time with.

07:17.021 --> 07:21.526
You know, comparing him with Peter Howard is unfortunate.

07:21.766 --> 07:24.589
You know, I thought he was a cold person.

07:25.008 --> 07:41.415
Yeah, and the fact that he was only interested, telling me that, and not discussing anything else about Faulkner, because I think I said something, and I could tell he wasn't interested.

07:41.435 --> 07:43.037
He was seeing me just for that drawer.

07:44.860 --> 07:48.526
Tell me anything else in the shop, and I wasn't interested in anything in the shop.

07:48.546 --> 07:50.830
Oh, I was interested in anything in the shop, but I don't remember him.

07:51.400 --> 07:56.025
spending any concentration or attention to me seeing anything else in the shot.

07:56.906 --> 08:00.290
I know that I was there only for that show until.

08:02.812 --> 08:04.074
Well, I was in Texas.

08:04.534 --> 08:06.556
Say that again.

08:06.657 --> 08:08.058
Most booksellers are left.

08:08.078 --> 08:20.952
Most booksellers are... Posenbach, probably, and I never met him, was one of the anxious people

08:21.269 --> 08:21.910
Alive.

08:22.451 --> 08:24.694
Except to the people that recorded.

08:24.995 --> 08:27.098
I've been through all of his letters.

08:27.118 --> 08:27.559
I don't know his name.

08:27.579 --> 08:36.572
Burnett was obnoxious, except in the staged presentations of when they were really operating.

08:37.614 --> 08:39.016
They could be anything.

08:39.036 --> 08:42.161
They were plastic.

08:42.181 --> 08:44.985
Books this man in other fields are like that.

08:45.005 --> 08:46.408
But there's something about booksellers.

08:46.888 --> 08:49.993
I also found it very, very depressing.

08:50.834 --> 09:01.786
to find out that from Saul Malkin to Jake Zeitlin to the great guy in 57, Jack Barkfield.

09:01.906 --> 09:08.073
I mean, the alcoholism was appalling to me of that generation.

09:08.093 --> 09:10.175
And Prover doesn't even drink, I don't think.

09:10.215 --> 09:10.716
You know what I'm saying?

09:10.776 --> 09:12.698
And Glenn Horowitz doesn't touch lick.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.483
It was like in between, you know, the generation.

09:18.070 --> 09:21.814
And I found that very, very revolting.

09:22.455 --> 09:26.380
I mean, these people would be drunk while they're working also, not just drinking privately.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.903
Am I right or wrong?

09:28.923 --> 09:31.085
And it was part of their charm, but not to me.

09:33.849 --> 09:37.093
So if you ask me what I thought about Lou Feldman, I mean, I don't know.

09:37.893 --> 09:40.857
It's tough to put him in the bag with the rest, but I mean, he wasn't too different.

09:40.897 --> 09:43.420
That generation was different.

09:43.940 --> 09:48.304
These guys were self-made men, and they did it with the theatrical and the drinking.

09:48.324 --> 09:48.885
George Deese.

09:48.905 --> 09:49.065
Huh?

09:49.085 --> 09:50.026
George Deese.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.347
All of them.

09:51.367 --> 09:52.348
I never knew him.

09:52.368 --> 09:53.149
Well, he died.

09:53.169 --> 09:55.491
He didn't know early.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.874
I mean, these guys were theatrical performers, right?

09:58.894 --> 09:59.875
They were.

09:59.895 --> 09:59.995
Sure.

10:00.015 --> 10:00.355
I know that.

10:00.636 --> 10:03.398
And it was very studied in Sullivan's case.

10:03.418 --> 10:04.299
I mean, he did this.

10:04.319 --> 10:05.340
He really... Right.

10:05.360 --> 10:05.840
I never.

10:06.741 --> 10:09.864
Shirley kept telling me, you better get there, get there, get there, go see.

10:10.565 --> 10:12.867
Close them back, and the success is...

10:12.948 --> 10:17.973
And I never was in their room.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.315
She says, you should see that room.

10:20.335 --> 10:22.457
I never did.

10:22.957 --> 10:25.359
Has Shirley supported your collecting?

10:25.379 --> 10:29.823
At the beginning, she actually pushed me into spending the money.

10:31.025 --> 10:31.285
Why?

10:32.326 --> 10:34.988
She saw that I wanted it.

10:35.028 --> 10:42.415
She saw that a man should have his own thing as well as a woman while they're doing things together.

10:43.002 --> 10:44.744
So this was my thing.

10:44.764 --> 10:45.506
It wasn't golf.

10:45.886 --> 10:47.168
It wasn't drinking with my buddies.

10:47.228 --> 10:48.670
It wasn't card playing.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.414
I never did any of that after college.

10:51.434 --> 10:52.095
I never played cards.

10:53.958 --> 10:55.860
I understand it, but I can't conceive of it.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.862
Are you that serious?

10:57.042 --> 10:58.444
I mean, don't you like to laugh at me?

10:58.464 --> 11:02.129
Oh, that the reason I stopped playing cards is that I was the only one that wasn't serious.

11:02.470 --> 11:03.391
That's why I stopped.

11:04.192 --> 11:06.676
These guys were deadly serious about playing cards.

11:06.696 --> 11:08.959
They weren't playing cards at the front of us.

11:08.979 --> 11:11.963
It's the opposite, I think, of what you just said.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.146
And golf the same way.

11:15.108 --> 11:19.313
I was trying to have fun with golf and these guys are killing one another.

11:19.333 --> 11:19.773
You're not killing us.

11:19.793 --> 11:20.514
It's a killing game.

11:20.534 --> 11:22.116
The competition is gone.

11:22.136 --> 11:23.457
And I'm not competitive in games.

11:24.579 --> 11:25.740
I'm not a game player.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.801
You're very competitive.

11:26.821 --> 11:27.162
What mean?

11:27.182 --> 11:28.003
I'm competitive in games.

11:29.905 --> 11:31.066
I'm competitive as an individual.

11:31.607 --> 11:35.171
I'm not playing a formal game.

11:35.371 --> 11:36.593
Not organized game.

11:36.773 --> 11:37.294
Organized games.

11:37.394 --> 11:39.336
Organized games.

11:39.436 --> 11:41.899
Organized games.

11:44.073 --> 12:03.122
I've all been ignoring these minds in one of the books, Groucho Marx, and a couple of the film scripts, some of the early, you know, you never want to be a member of any organization who wants to be for a member.

12:08.109 --> 12:08.250
Always.

12:08.270 --> 12:08.430
It's me.

12:08.450 --> 12:11.194
I don't want to be a member of any organization who wants to be for a member.

12:12.052 --> 12:16.318
I don't want to be a member of an organization that doesn't want me.

12:16.418 --> 12:20.423
Rick, you said you're all coveted.

12:20.503 --> 12:21.004
What do you think?

12:21.044 --> 12:25.610
There's something missing.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.636
There's something missing in our discussion that shouldn't be missing.

12:29.656 --> 12:32.460
And that is?

12:32.480 --> 12:37.266
And that is an act of creativity.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.409
I've got to show you my little...

12:40.402 --> 12:40.883
collection.

12:41.383 --> 12:42.204
It's only that wide.

12:43.045 --> 12:53.155
With Arthur Kessler's Act of Creation, you know, trying to describe what is creation, you know, creativity, because that's what I think I'm dealing with.

12:53.176 --> 12:56.159
And that's what you're dealing with.

12:56.199 --> 13:05.008
Collecting or trying to talk about the Michelangelo thing, you know, God and Adam, you know, where they touch, you

13:12.093 --> 13:25.473
A, there's one fact, and it's only begins of a poem or a couple sentences of a paragraph of a story or novel.

13:27.897 --> 13:39.374
I sit in and then look at it and then walk away and then 20 years from now quote those three lines and then somehow those three lines got them thinking about something else.

13:39.634 --> 13:40.716
I mean, what is that?

13:42.822 --> 13:43.343
Impulse.

13:43.944 --> 13:45.266
What do we call it?

13:45.286 --> 13:48.671
I mean, is it even worthwhile talking about it?

13:48.691 --> 13:53.077
And I say, I don't know how we cannot talk about it.

13:53.097 --> 13:57.123
You're talking about God-like stuff here.

13:57.143 --> 14:04.214
What is it that makes somebody acquire other people's creativity?

14:06.477 --> 14:06.717
Impulse.

14:06.938 --> 14:08.981
Let me talk a little bit about that.

14:09.341 --> 14:10.943
Go ahead.

14:10.963 --> 14:11.344
What is it?

14:13.501 --> 14:19.388
What is it that makes a book, you know, sit there in that goddamn store for 50 years?

14:21.450 --> 14:24.333
What is it that makes a piece of crap fly out of there?

14:25.855 --> 14:27.136
I'm talking about actions now.

14:27.156 --> 14:29.038
I'm not talking about thoughts.

14:29.939 --> 14:32.622
I'm talking about actual physical happening.

14:34.244 --> 14:35.846
I'm talking about musings or thinking.

14:36.907 --> 14:39.350
I'm into physical.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.711
Actions.

14:40.731 --> 14:41.432
Actions, reactions.

14:42.695 --> 14:46.860
Magic moments is really what I'm talking about.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.961
I'm not talking about want.

14:48.241 --> 14:56.090
I'm talking about an ongoing, amazing amount of these things happening every single day and night.

14:58.553 --> 15:00.375
About unique things that happen once a year.

15:01.296 --> 15:02.438
I'm talking about every single day.

15:02.498 --> 15:06.302
There's books here and there's books there and there's authors here and there's pieces of paper.

15:06.362 --> 15:11.588
I'm talking about creativity is really what I'm talking about.

15:12.327 --> 15:20.541
If your book is history, what I use is creativity.

15:22.845 --> 15:23.626
Let's ignore it.

15:23.687 --> 15:24.568
It's at your peril.

15:26.952 --> 15:30.919
I'm not sure how you can do with it, what you can do with it, but I don't want you to ignore it.

15:33.163 --> 15:36.208
We're not talking about passive matter here.

15:38.213 --> 15:44.099
I'm not talking about inactive people or inactive materials.

15:46.221 --> 15:53.689
I'm not talking about institutions that are basically dying.

15:53.950 --> 16:04.321
I'm talking about lost worlds and lost epochs and generation and that's over and all that stuff.

16:04.341 --> 16:07.444
I think that what I'm talking about is a combination of ongoing

16:07.711 --> 16:10.956
creativity, which has always been there and will always be there.

16:12.038 --> 16:16.024
And I'll describe it a little bit like this.

16:17.386 --> 16:19.268
Bucky Fuller that I admire like mad.

16:19.288 --> 16:19.709
You know that.

16:21.632 --> 16:28.923
Not as an architect, not as a form giver, but as a... Well, I call it a form giver.

16:29.003 --> 16:32.769
I call Frank Lloyd Wright and Vandero and Corbusier form givers.

16:33.089 --> 16:35.653
They never even passed, they never even went to college, these guys.

16:35.693 --> 16:36.975
They never had a university degree.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.956
Faulkner never had a university degree.

16:41.256 --> 16:48.805
You were in America without a university degree as a horseshit.

16:48.845 --> 16:51.589
He argues against him, naturally.

16:51.609 --> 16:52.690
Opposite.

16:52.710 --> 17:07.047
But he said, all the energy, he didn't say most, all the energy that has ever existed for Earth, which is our planet.

17:08.039 --> 17:12.104
It's not going up in smoke over there.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.107
It's still there.

17:14.287 --> 17:17.531
The fact that it's hanging around a little up in the air doesn't mean it's gone.

17:18.172 --> 17:21.296
We just don't know how to recapture it.

17:21.316 --> 17:23.999
No, why didn't you put any basis on it?

17:24.019 --> 17:26.642
Is this just the purpose of discussion?

17:26.682 --> 17:28.064
No, trying to stimulate.

17:30.407 --> 17:31.288
Also the continuum.

17:31.368 --> 17:35.093
I mean, you don't have to worry that you're losing energy.

17:36.052 --> 17:38.875
We worry about that all the time, that we're losing energy, right?

17:39.276 --> 17:41.018
And we have to find new pieces.

17:41.338 --> 17:42.279
We've never lost any energy.

17:42.900 --> 17:52.490
So what I'm suggesting is, you don't have to believe it or not believe it, but I'm suggesting that we've never lost any creativity, and the creativity we're living with all the time.

17:52.731 --> 17:54.693
It's not a question of waiting for another Fifth Symphony.

17:56.755 --> 18:00.559
It's being done all the time, and why don't we pay attention?

18:01.861 --> 18:05.485
And in the field of book collecting, this is one of the things that jates.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.616
I think this is energy in the book collecting.

18:09.196 --> 18:10.979
We're talking about capturing creativity.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.200
Forget about immortality now.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.543
We've already talked about that in Chronology.

18:14.784 --> 18:18.228
I'm talking about that every single minute.

18:19.029 --> 18:20.271
Something's going on here.

18:20.331 --> 18:21.693
It's bigger than Huntington.

18:22.213 --> 18:24.276
It's bigger than Huntington's collection.

18:24.296 --> 18:31.185
It's bigger than Huntington's utilization or Huntington's works or even Huntington or the booksellers.

18:33.308 --> 18:39.957
All Huntington did was repeat what other people have done and what other people are doing, et cetera, et cetera.

18:39.977 --> 18:41.959
That's all I'm saying.

18:41.979 --> 18:47.466
Is book collecting a way for you to grab a hold of this energy?

18:47.486 --> 18:49.188
Is it necessary to have a first edition?

18:49.989 --> 19:00.183
I told you the rules are with the birth and only with the death, and that doesn't even stop.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.324
It goes on after the death.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.661
What is the birth?

19:05.184 --> 19:07.187
The birth is not the publication of the book.

19:09.611 --> 19:14.458
It's the first time he wrote down something.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.727
But you've been curious when you thought about it, but I mean, that's hard to... Well, we can't capture that.

19:20.989 --> 19:25.516
But so you try to get as close to that creative moment, that creative explosion, as you can.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.639
Well, that's why we collect manuscripts.

19:27.659 --> 19:29.522
That's why we, ultimately, we...

19:29.924 --> 19:40.559
The Serious Collector attempts to find letters that predates the idea that this guy's going to write Sound of Fury.

19:40.579 --> 19:45.447
So there's some letters that you can find where Faulkner's already talking about the Sound of Fury.

19:45.607 --> 19:49.232
He's talking about the characters in the Sound of Fury.

19:49.988 --> 19:57.017
spitting them out in some short stories, but I'm talking about a letter that talks about something that's going to come out later as a part of the sound theory.

19:57.057 --> 19:57.498
You follow me?

19:57.718 --> 19:58.940
I'm talking about the chronology.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.562
This is the way it is.

20:01.904 --> 20:04.047
I'm not suggesting that you have to go along with it.

20:04.147 --> 20:05.749
I'm just telling you that's the way it is.

20:06.170 --> 20:11.477
I'm trying to elucidate it.

20:11.497 --> 20:13.239
Because it's a stage in the process.

20:13.259 --> 20:13.840
Well, of course.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.823
You can't say that's not important.

20:15.903 --> 20:16.924
Everything is important.

20:17.107 --> 20:20.832
Everything identifiable is of equal value.

20:20.953 --> 20:24.097
You place very high value on the uncorrected proof.

20:24.117 --> 20:27.242
Very high.

20:27.262 --> 20:31.528
The word uncorrected proof really means advanced copy and wrappers.

20:31.548 --> 20:36.455
Because there's nothing that's going to be proofed further than the uncorrected proofs.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.039
Am I right or wrong?

20:39.059 --> 20:39.359
That's correct.

20:39.379 --> 20:44.066
So we only know if there's a difference if somebody will sit down and nobody sits down anymore.

20:44.086 --> 20:44.486
Is that correct?

20:44.506 --> 20:45.628
Does anybody sit down?

20:46.199 --> 20:48.141
and say this is not an uncorrected proof.

20:48.202 --> 20:50.565
This is the same word for word as in the book.

20:50.585 --> 20:52.928
Well, that's called the collation.

20:52.948 --> 20:54.189
That's the Hinman collator.

20:54.730 --> 20:58.435
How many times in the last 30 years have you looked in the Hinman collator?

20:58.515 --> 21:00.617
I looked in the Hinman collator 40 years ago.

21:00.998 --> 21:04.262
Well, that was created strictly for the first four-wheel shake.

21:04.282 --> 21:05.564
I've never looked in one since.

21:06.505 --> 21:07.566
I thought of buying one.

21:08.407 --> 21:10.951
There's a guy out in Berkeley who actually has one.

21:10.971 --> 21:11.832
I should have one.

21:11.852 --> 21:16.037
I haven't thought about it in years, but I always thought I should have one.

21:16.405 --> 21:20.051
I mean, if I'm talking uncorrected proof, what am I doing?

21:20.191 --> 21:22.915
Am I waiting for somebody else to tell me that that's worthless?

21:22.935 --> 21:24.518
Would you really go through every page?

21:25.119 --> 21:28.424
Have I had a hymn and call later?

21:28.444 --> 21:34.754
Take one proof in one book and then say, that stands for most of them.

21:34.774 --> 21:36.176
I'd say, or I'd take three.

21:37.118 --> 21:40.523
And if two out of three, there wasn't any changes,

21:41.262 --> 21:44.306
I would say that's why uncorrected proofs really aren't very important.

21:44.326 --> 21:47.471
Well, they are, because I'll tell you, I get a lot of them, and they're not just fiction.

21:48.512 --> 21:51.716
Have you ever found a change in any of your uncorrected proofs?

21:51.837 --> 21:52.978
Oh, absolutely.

21:53.018 --> 21:53.980
Good for you.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.565
Absolutely, in The Beat Queen by Louise Erickson.

21:57.585 --> 21:59.167
I don't have one.

21:59.247 --> 22:00.529
I didn't show you my American Indian fiction.

22:00.549 --> 22:05.616
I told you about the Bob Stone thing, where I called them and said, you've got the liver on the wrong side of the bar.

22:05.636 --> 22:07.959
Yeah, well, they don't have the proofs, so I can't even have anything to be fair with.

22:08.019 --> 22:08.820
And I can show it to you.

22:08.860 --> 22:09.441
Okay, all right.

22:09.802 --> 22:10.122
So...

22:11.840 --> 22:14.705
Am I wrong in saying that that's worth two or three times the book?

22:16.427 --> 22:20.714
Assuming that, first of all, it precedes.

22:21.816 --> 22:27.405
And if it is different, then it's got to be worth at least twice as much as the next one, because it precedes.

22:28.567 --> 22:37.020
In regard to grasping or embracing, that's perhaps the better word, embracing these authors, that part of it is where they discuss

22:37.591 --> 22:41.175
I find that the more I want to talk about their work, the less they want to talk about their work.

22:41.916 --> 22:45.140
If I'm talking about something else, they want to talk about their work.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.384
I find it very hard to communicate with any of them.

22:48.404 --> 22:49.285
It was going the other way.

22:49.325 --> 22:53.230
But that's the reason you started doing that, I guess.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.532
You just found it wasn't very successful.

22:55.713 --> 22:55.933
No.

22:56.534 --> 22:59.037
I would say no to the last question.

22:59.518 --> 23:07.007
The reason that I associate with the authors is that I consider the creator more important than I do the creative.

23:09.232 --> 23:13.577
Dorita believes that it's Faulkner is more important than The Sound of the Fury.

23:15.139 --> 23:20.385
What do you, Faulkner, continue to exist?

23:20.405 --> 23:23.108
It's more important than the book?

23:23.128 --> 23:26.372
You know, the new critics say, don't even consider the life.

23:26.392 --> 23:27.233
Look at the text.

23:27.253 --> 23:27.993
Well, that's Dorita.

23:28.434 --> 23:30.036
That's bullshit.

23:30.056 --> 23:30.717
He's doing it.

23:31.838 --> 23:37.264
He's self-declaiming a known fact that it's magic.

23:37.548 --> 23:41.672
a single reader in a single work, which I've discussed with you before.

23:42.953 --> 23:46.657
But past that, I don't want to say anything more about it.

23:46.677 --> 23:47.518
It is magic.

23:48.119 --> 23:54.585
I mean, but don't make statements about it at the exclusion of other things.

23:55.046 --> 24:06.357
In Sound of the Fury, you're talking about Faulkner's life as he sees it in America, in a very sophisticated act, and not identifying himself as any one of the single characters, which is a great feat.

24:06.944 --> 24:11.208
This is art and this is real.

24:11.588 --> 24:27.604
But given my druthers, I continue to state that it's Faulkner that he is a greater, Faulkner himself is greater than any of his single accomplishments.

24:27.624 --> 24:36.192
I'm not sure Faulkner is greater than the total of all his accomplishments, but I can tell you it's Melville that we should salute and not Moby Dick.

24:36.526 --> 24:49.566
We salute Moby Dick as a great book, but, I mean, the accomplishment of Herman Melville, the life of Herman Melville is just... Don't get bogged down in any of the single works.

24:49.786 --> 24:51.128
You know what I'm saying?

24:51.148 --> 24:53.091
Obviously, yeah.

24:53.111 --> 25:03.647
I do say, very strongly, because I'm committed to this in my collectivism, that every Faulkner is of equal value.

25:03.965 --> 25:11.853
It's stupid to say that the crummy short stories of his early years is equal to Sound and the Fury, but I'm making that statement to make a point.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.038
That Sound and the Fury is Faulkner.

25:16.058 --> 25:18.640
So was the early short stories of Faulkner.

25:18.661 --> 25:26.489
So in order to be consistent, I say that you can't say that this one isn't as good as the other one.

25:26.529 --> 25:27.009
It's all him.

25:27.049 --> 25:29.472
We just don't study it properly.

25:29.552 --> 25:31.474
I think I'd rather read

25:31.825 --> 25:33.747
As I lay dying, I'm saying.

25:34.427 --> 25:37.010
Yeah, but I'll take the Hamlet and you can have all the rest of them.

25:37.290 --> 25:40.273
I think the Hamlet is the greatest thing to look at.

25:40.293 --> 25:44.857
What the Hamlet is superb.

25:44.877 --> 25:49.221
You know why the Hamlet beats As I Lay Dying?

25:49.241 --> 25:49.961
It's for analogy.

25:51.783 --> 26:00.371
The harmony and the Hamlet to be a more equal mixture than the As I Lay Dying comic.

26:00.391 --> 26:01.832
And not enough tragedy to think.

26:03.550 --> 26:11.141
A big, big relationship with comedy and tragedy as being life.

26:11.222 --> 26:18.593
In terms of entertainment, you know.

26:20.455 --> 26:23.400
But it's what's retained that we have to live with after that.

26:24.802 --> 26:27.025
The moment of the pleasure is gone.

26:28.728 --> 26:31.532
In retaining it, you remember the pleasure.

26:31.782 --> 26:34.665
I think you can remember it with pleasure, too.

26:34.685 --> 26:35.747
You can remember with pleasure.

26:35.887 --> 26:36.327
All of that.

26:36.448 --> 26:43.376
But what I'm saying is you really move out of that pretty fast.

26:43.396 --> 26:50.744
Remember, the so-called total pleasure becomes somewhat less than total pleasure, and it's also got other factors in there.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.687
Here we go again with the movement in time.

26:53.147 --> 26:56.011
I believe you have to be intellectual.

26:56.031 --> 26:56.271
I am.

26:56.639 --> 26:57.901
You have to be.

26:57.921 --> 26:59.063
I think that's pretty obvious.

26:59.083 --> 26:59.483
Yes, I am.

26:59.503 --> 27:01.346
I find myself totally absorbed.

27:01.426 --> 27:02.668
I find it as godlike.

27:02.768 --> 27:05.111
And I gather you don't like to waste time.

27:06.674 --> 27:12.322
Well, nobody does, but I mean, I really try to live my life in saying that that cousin of mine is a waste of time.

27:12.582 --> 27:15.807
You know, I mean, I live my life pretty rigid.

27:16.588 --> 27:19.432
Look at that beautiful cardinal.

27:19.452 --> 27:21.195
No, we get a few.

27:21.462 --> 27:23.265
All right, there's less and less birds all the time.

27:23.285 --> 27:29.894
I don't know where the hell the birds are, and surely he'll tell me it's the wrong time of life or time of day or something.

27:29.914 --> 27:31.216
But we used to have a lot more birds.

27:31.256 --> 27:32.418
I don't know where the hell the birds are.

27:36.283 --> 27:36.624
That's beautiful.

27:36.644 --> 27:39.288
You know it pretty well?

27:39.308 --> 27:47.780
In retrospect, the private libraries have a higher form, but it's a different plateau.

27:49.763 --> 27:51.385
And I think in terms of libraries,

27:53.322 --> 27:59.067
I'm sure it's the other way around with most people.

27:59.488 --> 28:03.251
They think in terms of collections and then they think of libraries.

28:03.391 --> 28:10.438
I always thought of libraries before the collections because I used to spend a lot of time when I was little in libraries.

28:11.379 --> 28:22.249
So it seems like work from that direction as opposed to, you know, they're different than most of the people that you talk to, the book collectors,

28:22.567 --> 28:24.189
They don't really come from libraries.

28:24.910 --> 28:37.646
They use libraries, they run libraries, but they don't really have a background and remembrance of being where they started collecting, as opposed to later.

28:38.888 --> 28:41.932
Because I was in libraries before I started collecting.

28:42.152 --> 28:43.494
Am I on to something here?

28:43.514 --> 28:50.683
A lot of them started collecting and then started finding out what libraries were doing with their collections, and were libraries on their collections.

28:51.355 --> 28:56.421
It seemed like I was working with libraries before I was working with questions.

28:56.441 --> 29:01.908
You feel the one thing you showed me and talked about is the private library.

29:01.928 --> 29:13.443
I know, but the private library can... But it's too late for the private library to be recomposed as a Morgan Library or a Huntington.

29:13.463 --> 29:21.193
So my private libraries then go into other libraries, but they don't live on

29:23.485 --> 29:24.727
collectively as they were.

29:24.787 --> 29:26.529
Am I right?

29:26.569 --> 29:30.954
There's nobody—I mean, Brodsky didn't build a building either.

29:32.336 --> 29:36.681
You know, the fact that he's a room and a building is the distinction I'm making, as opposed to a separate building.

29:37.082 --> 29:40.646
You know what I'm saying?

29:40.706 --> 29:41.888
So that's over.

29:42.569 --> 29:52.581
The last one to do a library all by himself are now the ones that are doing libraries in connection with—correct me if I'm wrong—in connection with the art museum.

29:53.219 --> 29:55.461
There's a guy out in California, Santa Barbara.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.725
How do you do that?

30:00.186 --> 30:01.427
Say the word.

30:01.447 --> 30:14.981
Toby Olsman is working on collections where most of my wonderful friends that have supplied me with wonderful books and material for 30 years find themselves hard pressed to supply.

30:16.863 --> 30:22.348
Because either I'm buying new books from local sources or

30:22.801 --> 30:28.290
I was interested in manuscript or unusual material.

30:28.310 --> 30:36.904
It's hard to keep up and supply me with Israeli, opiates, even American Indians.

30:36.924 --> 30:40.270
They find that the books that they have in their stock, I bought years ago.

30:41.312 --> 30:44.036
And the ones I'm looking for, nobody has.

30:45.579 --> 30:48.083
So you've kind of become your own scout, is that right?

30:49.025 --> 30:55.812
I don't have to go to the Soviet Union for English editions.

30:55.832 --> 31:03.801
I have to go into 4,000 stores in the United States, and I don't have the time anymore to find four books that I don't own.

31:05.683 --> 31:18.036
And I have been to London so many times, and each time I'm in London, I find either three or five only books that I don't have.

31:19.113 --> 31:20.436
in Soviet literature and English.

31:21.077 --> 31:23.022
And I find that very interesting.

31:23.042 --> 31:30.398
And yet I lack a lot of... See, the formula, the conception, what else?

31:31.059 --> 31:31.841
Only black here.

31:31.901 --> 31:35.649
I don't know why.

31:35.809 --> 31:37.493
The idea of the Soviet collection is

31:38.097 --> 31:40.741
It's kind of a spin-off of the Israeli collection.

31:41.101 --> 31:43.084
I have 1917.

31:43.284 --> 31:46.709
But, I mean, was that one of the reasons that you considered the Soviet collection?

31:46.789 --> 31:47.490
Absolutely.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.914
Of the kind of thinking they wanted to be the Israeli collection.

31:49.934 --> 31:53.198
Phronologically, you are correct.

31:55.482 --> 32:00.629
The Soviet period is identifiable as October 1917.

32:02.732 --> 32:07.058
And I've got some 1918 and 1919, which are like crazy, in English.

32:09.299 --> 32:14.584
Again, I skip over Gorky.

32:14.604 --> 32:18.248
I skip over Gorky because of the enormity of the material.

32:20.710 --> 32:36.806
Again, Gorky is in some ways more Russian than he is Soviet, and I'm able to slip out of the trap so that I go post-Gorky, and everybody understands what I'm talking about.

32:37.066 --> 32:39.188
How about Solzhenitsyn?

32:41.547 --> 32:45.614
I don't even have enough room to put him in the main room.

32:45.634 --> 32:47.777
He's up in the attic.

32:47.797 --> 32:51.283
Absolutely.

32:51.363 --> 32:53.025
He was an Israeli immigrant.

32:54.287 --> 32:56.932
He was an Israeli who found they couldn't live in Israel anymore.

32:58.034 --> 33:00.117
They still classify them as Israeli.

33:00.357 --> 33:00.838
Is T.S.

33:01.259 --> 33:03.943
Eliot an American who won the Nobel Prize?

33:04.143 --> 33:06.145
That's right.

33:06.446 --> 33:08.989
I even got a triple header.

33:09.369 --> 33:14.535
I have Russians who wrote in the Soviet Union, stayed in Israel a few years, and now are writing in America.

33:18.099 --> 33:20.983
That's part of my challenge and part of my burden.

33:21.383 --> 33:23.025
How do you classify somebody like I.G.

33:23.045 --> 33:23.346
Singer?

33:24.066 --> 33:24.327
I don't.

33:25.068 --> 33:26.549
He doesn't fit in any of my collections.

33:28.251 --> 33:30.374
His first book in English is personally signed to me.

33:31.495 --> 33:33.137
We have some of his books, but they're not

33:33.590 --> 33:34.451
part of the collection.

33:35.632 --> 33:49.684
He's a man... I would say, if I was collecting Yiddish literature, then I could qualify Isaac Ray Steven Singer as Yiddish literature.

33:49.704 --> 33:56.589
The problem is, the problem is, you know, it wouldn't matter whether he came from Poland and lived in New York.

33:56.609 --> 33:59.112
He qualified as a Yiddish writer, and he would like that.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.274
Well, if he writes in Yiddish, he must.

34:02.294 --> 34:03.175
Well, wrong.

34:04.302 --> 34:06.104
We know that as well.

34:07.105 --> 34:19.220
Toby also says it's been many, many years since that man writes his own translator, and his money comes from his English printed books.

34:19.240 --> 34:31.795
His money does not come from his Yiddish printed books, and the man has broken through the barrier and acknowledged that writing for the English reader

34:33.209 --> 34:46.160
He has no world career, and he stopped writing in Yiddish past the point that he's a Yiddish writer, but he's already projected in how it's going to sound in English.

34:46.180 --> 34:46.821
Are you following me?

34:47.341 --> 34:50.384
I know this for sure, because this is what the Russian writers have been doing.

34:50.684 --> 34:53.346
This is what Joseph Brodsky's enigma is.

34:53.366 --> 34:55.748
This is what the Israelis have a problem.

34:57.250 --> 35:02.254
They know, on the side, that they're limited in their Hebrew language.

35:02.757 --> 35:12.152
readership, so that while he's writing in Hebrew, he's already thinking in terms of English, and he's admitted this to me.

35:12.172 --> 35:20.144
So when I told him translations, and I know these agonies, Joseph Brodsky used to have somebody translate for him.

35:20.905 --> 35:29.138
He now translates his own material, basically, and is terribly confused, and it's a tragic event for him.

35:29.378 --> 35:30.520
How does it come out in English?

35:31.343 --> 35:35.850
Oh, it comes out in Russian, so it's hard for me to tell you how it comes out in English.

35:38.113 --> 35:56.760
The good news is, it's the bad news for him, but it's the good news for me, because he's writing dialogue for English, I claim, that due to the wonderful socialism,

35:57.567 --> 36:14.663
Well, the idea that these people have to break out of one language in order to have international careers in other languages, the main language being English, that they have to, especially when they read and understand and speak English, these people, that they have the complete understanding that they're really mixed up now.

36:14.723 --> 36:15.604
They're schizophrenic.

36:16.385 --> 36:27.135
Amistad wants to be a Hebrew writer, but he's already tied in with his idea that he has to be thinking the ultimate, which is the English.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.959
Discovered this many years ago.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.101
The breakout.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.824
I have a little described picture from him.

36:33.844 --> 36:34.966
He says, the breakout.

36:35.807 --> 36:39.912
He's signing his English edition.

36:40.113 --> 36:43.998
We're talking about the wonderful world of translation as a collectible.

36:44.218 --> 36:54.692
And I'm reminding you that there will be collections somewhere of a translated work

36:55.651 --> 36:57.694
from classics on through.

36:58.395 --> 37:00.859
And I'm telling you, this is a wonderful thing.

37:00.879 --> 37:04.385
If I was talking to kids on what to collect, I would encourage them.

37:05.907 --> 37:07.590
Magic there.

37:07.610 --> 37:08.731
Exposure, magic.

37:09.212 --> 37:11.596
I'm very, very involved in this.

37:11.616 --> 37:14.300
I think about it all the time because I'm dealing in this all the time.

37:15.782 --> 37:20.049
Let's transcend a little bit, the idea that somebody collects only in English.

37:20.149 --> 37:20.730
Is that correct?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.429
It is, yeah.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.711
I don't know any type of those collections.

37:24.731 --> 37:28.014
I basically still am collecting English, but then I go... The theory is follow the flag.

37:28.074 --> 37:31.338
I mean, you don't... Yeah, well, that's what I like, follow the flag.

37:31.798 --> 37:39.666
But what I'm saying is, my basic interest in Pasternak and Babel comes backwards into the original from the English.

37:41.809 --> 37:44.131
My obsession is every single thing in English.

37:44.852 --> 37:46.413
And, of course, now I like the Russian things.

37:46.494 --> 37:46.954
I love them.

37:47.086 --> 38:03.084
You know, especially as they become more and more valuable, they become more and more enamored of my own... But, I mean, I really don't know what the hell I'm doing when I'm buying a Russian book or a Hebrew book or an Arabic book.

38:03.104 --> 38:05.326
So I'm all by myself, and I don't know.

38:05.346 --> 38:06.407
I just do the best I can.

38:06.648 --> 38:12.594
So you are collecting things that it's impossible for you to read?

38:12.614 --> 38:17.059
I've got a pile of Arabic, Palestinian or Arabic, whatever you want to call it.

38:18.862 --> 38:22.566
I can't even catalog it because I don't even know what it is anymore.

38:22.586 --> 38:23.747
I don't even know who the writer is.

38:23.767 --> 38:25.689
Why are you collecting it?

38:25.709 --> 38:27.691
Because it's part of the genre.

38:27.711 --> 38:32.996
You don't know if it's good or bad.

38:33.016 --> 38:34.557
You have to rely on what other people said.

38:36.239 --> 38:42.445
In Arabic, it seems like ten years ago I knew every one of these writers as being somewhere on a piece of paper.

38:42.845 --> 38:47.890
I had two or three people give me the list of the leading writers in Arabic.

38:48.562 --> 38:51.565
And I used to check my list against them, and I used to make two piles.

38:52.225 --> 38:55.909
The ones where their names appeared, and then the names of the books where they didn't appear.

38:56.149 --> 38:59.853
And then I never got to the second stage of asking people about that second tier.

39:00.614 --> 39:03.897
So I'm not that bad.

39:04.197 --> 39:06.399
I mean, I have methodology here.

39:07.380 --> 39:08.081
I'm on my way.

39:08.761 --> 39:14.307
And I used to have a couple kids send me for 65 cents a piece from Haifa, these books.

39:14.327 --> 39:15.227
I told you, 65 cents.

39:15.247 --> 39:17.910
And this was retail.

39:18.143 --> 39:19.365
And they made something on it.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.749
Oh, they used to ask me for $20 every time I got a package.

39:22.769 --> 39:23.030
$20.

39:23.130 --> 39:25.933
How many years did you remember?

39:25.973 --> 39:28.297
These are the insanely high prices.

39:29.198 --> 39:31.140
A few books that you paid thousands for.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.682
I remember anything about in between.

39:33.083 --> 39:39.952
Have you ever spent too much in your abuse?

39:39.972 --> 39:40.353
Single item?

39:40.373 --> 39:41.895
Yeah, very good.

39:41.915 --> 39:44.759
I never felt badly about overspending for a single item.

39:44.779 --> 39:46.581
I've always felt badly over the years.

39:46.865 --> 39:53.555
in buying, like I showed you, $3,300 worth of books at the same time in six packages.

39:53.575 --> 40:06.855
I feel I'd spent too much money for something that I can't absorb for maybe a half a year, badly in the years when I couldn't afford it, running up $200,000 of Marguerite Clowns when I should have spent $60.

40:06.875 --> 40:13.705
I always felt badly in overspending overspending, but I didn't relate it to the value of the book that I bought.

40:13.725 --> 40:16.129
So it's an answer a little different.

40:16.632 --> 40:21.959
Of course, don't you feel bad that you had spent $300 all of a sudden and you say, my God, I spent $300.

40:21.979 --> 40:31.892
Charles Feinberg told me, Charles Feinberg told me, about a dime for a comic book.

40:31.912 --> 40:35.898
I always had a dime for a comic book.

40:35.918 --> 40:42.226
So Feinberg said, breakfast and lunch, you're thinking about real... People went hungry to buy books.

40:42.246 --> 40:45.130
You say you split it.

40:45.150 --> 40:46.171
Your success is a long thing.

40:46.192 --> 40:46.572
I just wasn't sure.

40:46.805 --> 40:58.622
This is semi-retirement where I sold some shares in our business.

40:58.902 --> 41:05.431
I drew money out of the business in order to buy this license.

41:07.895 --> 41:13.082
I gave up income in order to partly bought this because of the

41:14.142 --> 41:16.245
I've got a question on that.

41:16.346 --> 41:21.234
I partly bought this because of that room and the attic.

41:21.414 --> 41:21.955
You understand?

41:22.175 --> 41:24.599
But when you said you couldn't afford to pay, why would you phone $270?

41:24.619 --> 41:33.695
I was only making $1,000 a month, drawing $1,000 a month out of the business to pay your $275 that I spent that one month.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.219
I didn't spend $275 every month.

41:36.239 --> 41:39.424
But when you said, did I ever feel sorry in spending a lot of money?

41:39.758 --> 41:42.100
I didn't relate it to 2.75 for a book.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.484
I related it to 2.75 for a bunch of material.

41:46.504 --> 41:46.804
Never?

41:47.485 --> 41:47.765
Never.

41:49.607 --> 41:53.230
So, an item.

41:54.431 --> 41:59.376
Or that I had to pick it off.

41:59.396 --> 42:03.279
I didn't, well, I don't think of selling a book.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.521
I'm deadly serious.

42:05.341 --> 42:07.603
I'm deadly serious.

42:07.623 --> 42:09.445
Meaning, I'm not interested in bi-play.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.002
You know what I mean?

42:11.022 --> 42:12.524
It's not the fun of the event.

42:14.587 --> 42:19.233
I'm not getting an emotional high by buying or selling a book.

42:19.313 --> 42:23.599
My emotional high comes from being involved in the fact that I'm even doing it.

42:23.639 --> 42:30.569
It's a way of life, not an individual event.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.129
What time is it?

42:32.051 --> 42:34.394
I'm going to close this.

42:34.454 --> 42:36.597
I think I'm creating thoroughly.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.802
I see that was good.

42:39.822 --> 42:40.963
What do people say?

42:41.003 --> 42:42.544
People always say, how much?

42:42.624 --> 42:45.087
How come you always have so much time to do what you want?

42:45.848 --> 42:47.970
You know, I'm a little fanatic.

42:47.990 --> 42:49.231
Of course you have enough time.

42:49.251 --> 42:51.633
It's called energy level.

42:52.374 --> 42:54.176
How can Joyce Carol Oates write all those books?

42:55.918 --> 42:59.181
Well, I wish she took a little more time.

42:59.221 --> 43:00.863
I wish I took just a little more time.

43:02.124 --> 43:06.909
I think they'd do better books, is what I think.

43:06.929 --> 43:08.170
Something that's wonderful, what?

43:08.842 --> 43:11.947
I didn't follow a thrill.

43:11.967 --> 43:12.668
Beck is back.

43:15.071 --> 43:21.962
Bruce Carl Oates wrote a book about a nutty book collector bothering her, which may or may not be me.

43:22.803 --> 43:23.324
Oh, is that right?

43:24.445 --> 43:25.607
Beck is back, it's in there?

43:26.028 --> 43:27.550
No, Beck is back is Updike.

43:27.710 --> 43:36.283
I know that, but you say where he thinks he's the imaginary Beck, and Beck gets bothered by this lunatic collector.

43:36.685 --> 43:42.333
who's interested in the signed books and the variant editions and Bothers Beck.

43:42.373 --> 43:43.094
Did you ever read that?

43:43.494 --> 43:43.835
Yeah.

43:43.855 --> 43:45.457
Okay.

43:45.477 --> 43:46.619
Right.

43:46.639 --> 43:47.460
That's you, you think?

43:48.101 --> 43:48.301
No.

43:50.784 --> 44:02.641
The one that's me is the short story that I can't remember that Joseph Carol Oates did years ago on the same paint, her involvement with somebody asking her to sign a limited first edition or something.

44:02.661 --> 44:04.363
Originary author, but she is the author.

44:05.592 --> 44:09.155
There's other things, and I stopped pursuing it.

44:10.156 --> 44:12.118
But this is one, and this is two.

44:12.438 --> 44:13.820
How many more are there?

44:13.840 --> 44:14.460
I don't know.

44:14.480 --> 44:18.945
There's got to be more, because every one of these writers gets involved sooner or later and writes about it.

44:19.385 --> 44:19.785
You follow?

44:19.805 --> 44:20.706
It's part of their life.

44:21.467 --> 44:22.388
It's very interesting.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.652
You could make a neat little collection of that.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.755
Well, I'm going to have my opening chapter.

44:30.295 --> 44:33.338
Writers, which they consider to be nutty,

44:34.465 --> 44:37.812
book collectors, admirers, and collectors of their work.

44:38.834 --> 44:41.640
And it's incestuous and it's just wonderful.

44:41.881 --> 44:45.087
And this is examples, two examples.

44:45.167 --> 44:46.891
I can't think of the title.

44:46.991 --> 44:47.592
I wish you could.

44:48.995 --> 44:53.605
Tell me the difference in your mind between a collection and a library.

44:54.243 --> 44:56.507
you're building private libraries.

44:56.607 --> 45:03.700
I mean, we've never actually asked you to distinguish between them.

45:03.720 --> 45:13.838
Well, I don't know if a single collection can call itself a library, but I believe that my collection

45:14.155 --> 45:26.072
become a private library, both in the physical sense and the way they're handled and the way they're shelved and the way they're displayed.

45:26.092 --> 45:29.777
The exhibit tables that I have is an example of that.

45:32.361 --> 45:42.475
I think using the exhibit table carries it from the room of collections to the actual library.

45:43.501 --> 45:58.225
The fact that you function, the functions that you do.

45:58.245 --> 45:58.666
The use.

45:58.686 --> 45:58.946
The use.

45:58.966 --> 46:01.490
And the use other than your own as well.

46:01.510 --> 46:02.332
Utilization is the magic word.

46:02.672 --> 46:03.353
For people other than yourself.

46:03.373 --> 46:06.859
Special collections basically are very confined

46:07.480 --> 46:12.526
The fact that they're in a library, that there are many of them.

46:13.247 --> 46:22.258
Well, the fact that they're in a library brings it to a different plateau.

46:23.199 --> 46:29.066
And what is that plateau?

46:29.166 --> 46:31.108
It's utilization.

46:31.274 --> 46:36.404
because I didn't have the equipment to become a professional architect.

46:39.029 --> 46:51.612
My use of architects and my affinity with architects and my house architect and my own business and my book collection and everything, I come as close to being one as is humanly possible.

46:52.840 --> 46:57.025
analogy with my book collection.

46:57.045 --> 47:11.745
Because I'm not a professional writer and I don't write, my attachment to writing and my love of writing and my use of writing is as close as a human being can get to being a professional writer.

47:13.968 --> 47:21.177
I'm living vicariously and it has part to do with my plight.

47:21.865 --> 47:29.696
The books are almost a surrogate for you that you would like to be able to do this.

47:29.936 --> 47:39.169
That is separate from my treatment of the books as primary and separate from my use of the books in touch with their mortality.

47:39.670 --> 47:42.914
I mean, it's another thing.

47:42.934 --> 47:47.080
Another layer.
