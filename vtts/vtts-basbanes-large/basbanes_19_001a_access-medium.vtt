WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:09.459
Walter, how do we pronounce your last name correctly?

00:10.821 --> 00:12.384
Portsheimer.

00:17.812 --> 00:27.827
In your notes, you'll have to distinguish between father, who is Walter, and I, who am Walter L. I've got the middle initial, which I hate.

00:29.073 --> 00:35.721
So you'd prefer that I don't use it then?

00:35.941 --> 00:40.446
Well, if you've got to distinguish between father and me, you've got to use something.

00:40.466 --> 00:45.371
Okay.

00:45.472 --> 00:47.073
All right, what do you want to know?

00:47.254 --> 00:56.464
Well, I understand that when you were twenty-one years old, your father made quite an extraordinary gift to you, a gift of books.

00:57.389 --> 00:59.151
That's how Yale gets started.

00:59.951 --> 01:01.032
Is that right?

01:01.052 --> 01:01.773
Gifted books.

01:02.013 --> 01:02.153
Yeah.

01:02.173 --> 01:04.275
That's how Harvard gets started, I guess.

01:04.976 --> 01:06.957
Not nearly as normal.

01:06.977 --> 01:09.339
But John Harvard gave some books, I guess, now.

01:09.359 --> 01:11.421
Well, we'll get to that in a minute.

01:11.641 --> 01:14.644
Let me give you the background of how I got into this.

01:14.664 --> 01:15.124
All right.

01:19.768 --> 01:23.472
As I say, I came from a family of book collectors.

01:23.492 --> 01:27.295
There were four brothers, three of whom

01:28.709 --> 01:36.917
Carl, Arthur, and my father, all involved in rare books in one way or another.

01:38.759 --> 01:56.176
Carl—well, Carl and father both started their libraries about 1920, right after World War I. Arthur had always been a student.

01:56.196 --> 01:58.058
He'd studied abroad.

01:59.827 --> 02:09.657
studied at home, he'd always been a student, hated Wall Street.

02:09.677 --> 02:22.450
And ultimately, when Carl H. Fortzheimer and the company broke up at twenty-five or twenty-six, Arthur and my father left the firm.

02:23.531 --> 02:27.615
And ultimately, Arthur went in and set up his own rare book business.

02:27.635 --> 02:27.775
Really?

02:27.856 --> 02:44.254
Not a great success, but I'm very devoted to his memory because when he and Father were together, he would always ask what I was studying in that particular timeframe in likely literature or history.

02:45.716 --> 02:50.161
And your father would say, well, they're studying Shakespeare.

02:51.442 --> 02:56.648
A large and very top-flight biography of Shakespeare would

02:57.455 --> 02:59.397
end up at my desk the next day.

02:59.437 --> 03:08.106
He was interested in young people, and I was interested in reading.

03:08.607 --> 03:24.323
I read way ahead of my class, which almost drew on my education because they kept skipping the ed and grades because of my reading ability.

03:25.282 --> 03:28.745
As a result, I never learned arithmetic or fractions very well.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.407
Can't add or subtract now.

03:32.849 --> 03:34.830
You weren't a native Washingtonian, by the way.

03:34.850 --> 03:34.911
No.

03:34.931 --> 03:36.352
We should point that out.

03:36.372 --> 03:40.916
The family grew up— Grew up in Purchase, New York.

03:40.936 --> 03:41.256
Yes, sir.

03:44.239 --> 03:53.567
But my Uncle Isaac, who had some small collections of great delicacy and choice, was a great influence on me.

03:54.593 --> 04:07.265
And I remember there were days when, as a little boy, he would take me around to rare bookstores, and when he was going around looking for things for himself, he'd always buy me something.

04:07.825 --> 04:23.200
I'd have around this room somewhere, as his first book I recall, he bought me in the rare book field from a very well-known dealer in New York named James Drake.

04:24.968 --> 04:26.310
So that's one influence.

04:28.053 --> 04:28.454
Carl Sr.

04:28.694 --> 04:30.237
had no impact on me.

04:30.697 --> 04:41.915
After all, I was ten years old about, or eleven when the firm broke out, so I knew him only as an uncle.

04:43.378 --> 04:49.568
Was this an amicable separation of the family?

04:49.628 --> 04:51.010
No, no.

04:52.475 --> 04:53.056
No.

04:53.076 --> 04:53.917
No, it wasn't at all.

04:53.937 --> 04:55.078
That was the two wives.

04:55.098 --> 04:57.661
Oh, I don't want to say that.

04:57.681 --> 05:00.744
Uh, no, no.

05:01.485 --> 05:10.996
Whenever you don't want me to use something, just say it, by the way, and, uh... Well, I literally, uh... And we don't have to go into any detail of this, but I was just curious.

05:11.016 --> 05:15.000
Well, Carl and my father literally, except under what circumstances, never taught.

05:17.963 --> 05:21.267
I mean, if they were in a room together, for some reason,

05:22.512 --> 05:23.914
Bad blood, in other words.

05:24.195 --> 05:25.937
Dead head drops in corners.

05:27.600 --> 05:36.394
And then Carl, of course, formed the great Fortheimer Library, now at the University of Texas.

05:36.414 --> 05:40.761
Are you pleased, by the way, that I went to Texas?

05:40.781 --> 05:45.869
Well, I think the whole thing was probably mismanaged almost from scratch.

05:46.731 --> 05:49.515
But Carl, and particularly his wife,

05:49.985 --> 05:51.327
had a great ego.

05:51.347 --> 05:56.194
They never wanted to give anything unless their name was on it in lights.

05:57.797 --> 06:03.105
So that he was somewhat limited, strangely enough, where this great library could go.

06:03.125 --> 06:10.976
New York Public, where he sat on the board, it would have been duplicated 40, 50 percent.

06:10.996 --> 06:18.928
Harvard, where Carl Julia went, they weren't going to build him a building.

06:20.461 --> 06:25.809
He wanted to be sure of the lights through over the door and said, this is the Kyle Fortzheimer Library gift of.

06:25.869 --> 06:29.274
Texas will do that for you, by the way.

06:29.294 --> 06:29.714
That's better.

06:29.754 --> 06:32.158
Texas might, but of course, Kyle's long gone.

06:33.199 --> 06:46.619
Now, when you say the Kyle Fortzheimer Library went to the University of Texas, you're talking about the books involved in the so-called famous Fortzheimer catalog, which takes you up to about 1800.

06:46.639 --> 06:50.164
This is the catalog Bill Jackson did, three volumes.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.534
very scarce, hard-to-get items.

06:54.034 --> 06:58.298
Bradley Martin had a set that went for big bucks.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.781
I haven't seen Bradley's prices on those.

07:03.483 --> 07:10.809
But from 1800 on is another matter with Carl.

07:11.910 --> 07:19.637
Carl had the best, probably the best Shelley collection outside of the British Library.

07:19.657 --> 07:21.619
There were seventy-odd

07:22.173 --> 07:36.987
Shelly manuscripts, all the first editions, notebooks, letters of Shelly's family, Father Mary Walter.

07:37.007 --> 07:39.289
It's the biggest thing outside the British Library.

07:39.309 --> 07:39.930
Where did it go?

07:41.151 --> 07:51.741
And that, along with what Byron and Keatsy had in that period, Shelly and his circle is what they call it, is now in New York Public.

07:53.037 --> 07:57.040
I don't know.

07:57.861 --> 07:59.242
I just don't know.

07:59.543 --> 08:05.588
It's well known in the press, and I just don't have it anymore.

08:05.608 --> 08:06.208
I'll find it.

08:06.288 --> 08:10.031
So that part of the library is in New York Public.

08:10.051 --> 08:18.859
Now, my father decided he was going to collect books.

08:18.879 --> 08:22.622
He wasn't going into the English literature business, because

08:23.075 --> 08:24.657
Carl had that spread.

08:24.697 --> 08:29.724
They had no sense they were competing against each other for a first polio.

08:29.744 --> 08:32.608
But then again, if they didn't like each other, why not?

08:35.011 --> 08:44.504
My father always had a motto, never get in a sniffing match with a skunk.

08:44.524 --> 08:49.791
My mother, who had a very strong Francophile lead,

08:53.129 --> 09:00.138
So Father decided to go into the French field, and in particular, Molière.

09:00.158 --> 09:02.381
But did he like French stuff, personally?

09:03.663 --> 09:04.424
He knew his books.

09:04.484 --> 09:07.709
He didn't know Molière gravel as an English book.

09:07.729 --> 09:11.454
But I mean, this seemed to be a fertile area for him to collect.

09:11.474 --> 09:12.595
Yes, that is true.

09:12.615 --> 09:17.582
Not so much that it represented the love of his, the passion of his.

09:17.722 --> 09:22.509
Well, this goes back to a story also, I might tell you.

09:22.529 --> 09:22.849
That

09:23.774 --> 09:34.667
At the turn after World War I, there was a very famous bookseller, probably the most famous at the time, in this country named George Smith.

09:37.511 --> 09:51.908
George D. And George Smith, whom I barely remember meeting once or twice as a little boy when he'd come to purchase, George Smith

09:54.385 --> 10:02.157
took an option on the Schumann collection in Paris.

10:02.177 --> 10:03.880
I think it was a French collection.

10:05.262 --> 10:13.575
And I think it's S-C-H-U-H-M-A-N-N, Schumann.

10:19.445 --> 10:28.875
was bringing over to the States what would have been the greatest French collection ever sold in America.

10:28.895 --> 10:38.666
When, to his horror and surprise, he died, unexpectedly.

10:38.686 --> 10:47.055
The Schumann collection thus really became available, and

10:48.453 --> 10:58.425
A rising young bookseller in New York named Rosenbach.

10:59.726 --> 11:18.308
Young Rosenbach, who was just trying to build up his reputation, and you'll see this in Ed Wills' book, needed $12,000 to take an auction on the Schumelin collection.

11:19.790 --> 11:32.349
which Carl and my father put up, although in the version Ed Wolfe has, my father doesn't appear as one of those who did put up.

11:33.831 --> 11:37.176
Ed's got a couple of errors in that book.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.899
Well, everything goes to Carl on that.

11:39.300 --> 11:44.207
But Ed got his story from Carl, I'm sure, and father doesn't appear.

11:44.387 --> 11:47.552
And remember the difference between Carl and my father.

11:47.887 --> 11:58.238
My father would die at even the mention of his name if he gave a $5 gift to charity or a $5,000 gift to charity.

11:58.258 --> 11:59.639
His name was never on.

11:59.659 --> 12:00.800
It was always anonymous.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.562
He was very shy.

12:03.203 --> 12:06.967
He was very different from me.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.890
He'd go for a day almost without saying anything.

12:10.851 --> 12:11.592
Very quiet.

12:12.072 --> 12:12.593
Sensitive.

12:13.273 --> 12:13.854
Sensitive.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.635
Lovely guy.

12:17.658 --> 12:17.758
And

12:20.236 --> 12:41.873
I saw a person that wouldn't let his name get forward in a book about Rosenbach purchasing the Schumann Collection, although his name does appear, because the loan of the twelve grand was to be taken out in trade out of the sale of the collection.

12:44.333 --> 12:48.339
So there are books in here from the Schumann Library collection.

12:48.359 --> 12:52.785
A couple of them I've already given to Yale, actually.

12:52.805 --> 12:59.074
And Father was beginning to orient on the French, even that far back.

13:03.441 --> 13:06.104
And he had two prongs to that collection.

13:06.144 --> 13:12.754
The Royal French Bindings, of which Meijon Foote may have mentioned something.

13:12.835 --> 13:18.945
Which are these things over here, the Royal French, behind it.

13:18.965 --> 13:29.222
And then the Molière collection, which I guess is probably the best Molière collection in private hands in this country, is that young cover there.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.125
The whole wall there?

13:31.145 --> 13:33.709
Most of it.

13:33.829 --> 13:35.552
How many volumes are part of that?

13:36.562 --> 13:39.466
Well, I think there are about 10,000 volumes adhered.

13:39.626 --> 13:39.886
Wow.

13:40.968 --> 13:42.490
I mean, in the Moyer collection?

13:42.610 --> 13:42.790
No.

13:42.870 --> 13:43.090
No.

13:44.412 --> 13:45.914
I don't know.

13:47.136 --> 13:48.958
Ten thousand volumes in the library.

13:48.998 --> 13:54.385
Of which over five are the intelligence service collections.

13:54.405 --> 14:06.180
So between the Moyer and the Bindings, and a lot of books I've given away now, the reading libraries of one sort and another.

14:06.903 --> 14:11.969
That runs about five feet.

14:11.989 --> 14:14.892
In any event, Father built the Monier Collection.

14:15.994 --> 14:27.067
One reason it looks small to you here, around on the back corner are about twenty shelves of reference material from the seventeenth-century on.

14:27.247 --> 14:32.533
Father used to tell me that there wasn't any point—you know, it's way in back.

14:32.553 --> 14:36.538
Father used to tell me there wasn't any point in having a collection of first editions

14:37.160 --> 14:41.387
if you didn't have a reference collection to back it up and tell you things.

14:44.291 --> 14:47.336
And so there are about twenty shelves of reference material.

14:47.436 --> 15:00.176
And I do try to keep that up, up to a certain extent, when I go abroad every other year or so, and buy the newest French reference books.

15:00.296 --> 15:04.703
Or there's one very good dealer I use over there who

15:06.556 --> 15:09.880
because the catalog won't strike a year, and I buy quite a bit from him.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.321
Perez?

15:11.341 --> 15:12.562
And, uh, no.

15:13.804 --> 15:18.809
I saw him with a Bradley Martin, an interesting character.

15:18.829 --> 15:18.929
Yeah.

15:18.949 --> 15:19.190
A character.

15:19.210 --> 15:23.174
I know nothing about him except that I saw him with a shawl around, a red shawl.

15:23.194 --> 15:23.875
No, no comment.

15:24.015 --> 15:25.596
Okay.

15:25.616 --> 15:28.239
Just thought I'd see if I could get a little... No comment.

15:28.259 --> 15:36.268
...get a little rise out of the water in there.

15:36.288 --> 15:36.428
No.

15:38.112 --> 15:54.471
As a little boy in prep school, and then on to my first years in college at Yale, my father had about three volumes by an American author named Frank R. Stockton.

15:56.373 --> 16:06.465
Now, Frank Stockton, a generation or two before your time, was a very popular American author in the latter part of the 19th century.

16:07.627 --> 16:18.038
particularly well-known for one short story he wrote called The Lady of the Tiger, which you all have to read and study for college boards.

16:22.123 --> 16:35.878
The three or four volumes of Stockton that Father had on his shelves, I liked, I read them, enjoyed them, and began buying some more Stockton.

16:40.634 --> 16:46.464
And you could get a first donation for fifty cents or a buck, but you're not twice as you're seventy-five.

16:47.246 --> 16:48.268
Where'd you go?

16:48.328 --> 16:50.491
Where'd you look?

16:50.511 --> 16:53.617
Oh, the antiquarian row.

16:53.657 --> 16:54.438
The antiquarian row.

16:54.499 --> 16:58.806
He showed you something like that down Fourth Avenue.

16:58.826 --> 16:59.107
Fourth Avenue.

16:59.127 --> 17:02.693
Anyway, I began to build a stocking collection.

17:06.892 --> 17:14.463
And today it is the definitive collection of Frank Hart Stockton, because we brought the family out.

17:14.483 --> 17:15.905
We meaning you.

17:15.925 --> 17:18.529
We're probably right.

17:20.011 --> 17:26.300
I had a birthday about one for a month.

17:26.320 --> 17:34.452
And so in those ranges back there is the definitive collection of Stocktoniana, all the first editions.

17:34.718 --> 17:39.904
starting with his first book inscribed to his mother.

17:39.924 --> 17:57.625
Many of the manuscripts, the original manuscripts, although there Stockton had very serious eye trouble, gave him a serious headache to read or write, so he had to dictate if he read two books of the time.

17:58.306 --> 18:03.392
So most of these manuscripts are not in his own autograph, but

18:03.997 --> 18:09.522
A long book manuscript is completely in his own hand, and that is here.

18:10.643 --> 18:16.508
And some short stories that he managed to write— Are they typescripts, or are they somebody else's hologram?

18:16.989 --> 18:21.193
Well, this is in his own hand, and some stories are in his own hand.

18:21.593 --> 18:23.615
The rest are either his wife or his sister.

18:24.075 --> 18:30.801
It wasn't until quite late that his correspondence were going to be in typed for him.

18:31.442 --> 18:32.603
Most of the letters—

18:33.325 --> 18:39.515
of his correspondence with his publishers in here, and the original drawings in here.

18:39.776 --> 18:40.938
I don't know the writer.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.983
How does he rate today?

18:44.123 --> 18:48.811
Not rate, rate something.

18:48.831 --> 18:49.212
How does he endure?

18:49.232 --> 18:55.563
I don't take high school English anymore, but I suppose they might get the Lady of the Tiger thrown at them.

18:56.584 --> 18:58.708
Outside of that, no.

18:58.992 --> 19:04.920
But nevertheless, evaluate the importance of the collection.

19:05.361 --> 19:20.281
Well, the importance of the collection is simply a—at his time, probably the third most popular American author in the latter part of the 19th century, behind Mark Twain and William Dean Howells.

19:20.562 --> 19:28.813
So that's certainly— And I have his cash book of royalties here, which would show that for those times he got

19:29.063 --> 19:51.257
He also very kindly kept a notebook in which he wrote down the title of everything he ever wrote, when he started writing it, when he completed it, to whom he sold it, and for how much, and where the serial rights went.

19:51.659 --> 19:53.681
Well, that's very useful then, isn't it?

19:53.701 --> 19:54.542
It is very useful.

19:54.562 --> 19:59.748
My father kept saying with tears in his eyes, I wish it were Shakespeare.

19:59.768 --> 20:02.412
But it's interesting as a study of that period.

20:02.432 --> 20:03.693
Yeah, certainly.

20:03.713 --> 20:06.036
Of publishing as well as writing, I mean.

20:06.056 --> 20:06.536
That's right.

20:06.656 --> 20:09.039
And the original drawings are here.

20:09.059 --> 20:10.401
Charles David Gibson, A.B.

20:10.461 --> 20:10.881
Frost.

20:11.262 --> 20:12.563
That's good.

20:12.623 --> 20:13.625
First-class illustrator.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.687
That's amazing.

20:15.727 --> 20:20.873
There is a big collection of letters from Stockton to Frost.

20:21.511 --> 20:26.037
I hate to jump ahead, but what do you plan to do with that collection?

20:26.058 --> 20:26.638
That goes to Yale.

20:26.879 --> 20:27.900
Everything does to Yale.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.262
Everything does to Yale.

20:29.783 --> 20:31.105
Including my ashes, if they want them.

20:32.326 --> 20:48.750
But one of the interesting points about that collection is that—well, I've forgotten the point I was going to make.

20:51.633 --> 21:02.326
We're talking about the significance of the... Yeah.

21:02.346 --> 21:12.659
It fits into that period in the 19th century where you had major magazines like Century and Harper's and so forth where these things were serialized.

21:13.540 --> 21:18.987
Good illustrators were employed to illustrate them.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.150
But the important thing I was going to mention is that

21:22.008 --> 21:26.813
Stockton was a prolific correspondent.

21:26.833 --> 21:37.524
So I said to some surviving members of the Stockton family once, well, gosh, aren't there a lot of letters to Frank Stockton?

21:37.544 --> 21:40.667
Oh, yes, they said, there was a trunk or two full of them.

21:42.209 --> 21:47.014
But at the end of World War I, we got so tired of carrying them around, we hurt them.

21:48.996 --> 21:50.277
I said, well, what there?

21:50.898 --> 21:52.881
letters from people like Mark Twain.

21:53.442 --> 21:57.748
Oh, yes, they said, we remember those because we cut the autographs off before we burnt the letters.

21:59.290 --> 22:08.403
So that half of the correspondence, except for about 21 letters that I got from another member of the Stockton family who gave them to me, are gone.

22:08.523 --> 22:12.248
Where do you feel when you hear something like that?

22:12.269 --> 22:15.854
Well, you just lost another friend, that's all.

22:15.934 --> 22:19.639
Well, the point of talking about the Stockton Collection and

22:20.260 --> 22:32.694
And the fact is, my father's library door was always open to me because he saw that I knew how to handle books and liked to be in the library.

22:32.714 --> 22:40.723
And on my 21st birthday, he also saw that I was pretty well hooked in the rare book end of things.

22:40.743 --> 22:43.586
He said, well, son, you don't need another car.

22:44.768 --> 22:48.512
I'll give you the library for your 21st birthday, and here it is.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.073
The whole library?

22:52.153 --> 22:54.857
The whole library.

22:54.877 --> 22:55.578
The whole library.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.280
That must have knocked you on your butt.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.362
How come you can't touch it or something?

22:58.382 --> 22:58.982
Surprised.

22:59.663 --> 23:01.806
Well, what was your reaction?

23:01.826 --> 23:04.229
Thank you very much.

23:04.249 --> 23:07.013
I was grateful.

23:07.033 --> 23:13.943
And it just doubled my own load of— But it's a pretty resonant gift, isn't it?

23:13.963 --> 23:14.063
Yeah.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.765
I mean, it's something that has—

23:16.387 --> 23:22.895
Yeah, I mean, you know, you lived with it at that time.

23:23.036 --> 23:33.089
I'd lived with it for twenty-one years, but it was a shocker, really.

23:33.790 --> 23:37.114
Well, did it stay where it was?

23:37.174 --> 23:40.659
Stay where it was, yeah.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.582
But it became yours, obviously, I guess.

23:45.305 --> 23:45.685
That's right.

23:48.871 --> 23:58.423
I must confess that I have done very little with the binding collection of royal French bindings.

23:59.164 --> 24:03.209
That is an art form.

24:03.229 --> 24:09.697
If you're going to collect rare bindings, you're going to collect rare bindings, and then you just simply drive at it.

24:09.717 --> 24:18.608
There are a few very good ones here, including one of the famous Broglie bindings, which Yale is still salivating to get, although they

24:19.060 --> 24:20.503
have one from the melancholy.

24:20.523 --> 24:23.989
I think, in some ways, this is a better binding.

24:24.370 --> 24:25.632
Can you just point to it?

24:25.953 --> 24:28.818
No, it's in a song or change.

24:29.259 --> 24:29.980
No problem.

24:30.181 --> 24:33.106
So I don't do anything with the bindings.

24:33.286 --> 24:38.436
I just can't with the other tasks I have at the moment.

24:48.119 --> 25:13.468
This is particularly useful because you get the typical Grunier geometric pattern with his motto for John Grunier and his friends.

25:14.647 --> 25:20.794
But the enamel has stayed in remarkably good shape.

25:22.196 --> 25:24.839
That's exquisite.

25:24.859 --> 25:29.185
Or a bookmarked in about 1580 or something.

25:29.225 --> 25:32.349
And we have on it Saxonia, S-A-X-O-N-I-A.

25:32.369 --> 25:37.255
Yeah, this is Albert Franz's volume on Saxonia.

25:37.315 --> 25:42.221
Well, they just kind of just write it down so I can... Let me shut this off a second.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.422
The condition of the enamel.

25:43.790 --> 25:47.394
Well, this is not quite a folio size.

25:47.414 --> 25:51.739
That would be a folio size?

25:51.759 --> 25:53.101
Come on.

25:57.266 --> 25:57.987
That's nice.

25:58.527 --> 26:00.770
Thank you.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.894
Well, Miriam would never forgive me if I didn't show you that.

26:03.914 --> 26:04.014
Yeah.

26:04.314 --> 26:09.360
Well, this is—when I was at the Peeps Library, they let me handle the diary.

26:09.420 --> 26:13.645
That was kind of nice, too.

26:15.802 --> 26:19.987
Here you now have the genesis of Walter Elfworth's hammer.

26:21.608 --> 26:44.593
Now, on the money era, there were some gaps—a few, very few gaps—that I have been able to fill, particularly in what you call the ballet that Father didn't have.

26:44.978 --> 26:59.896
My father built this French collection with the help of the greatest expert in progress, perhaps, a legendary figure and a wonderful gentleman named Seymour de Ritchie.

26:59.916 --> 27:04.181
I remember the first time I met de Ritchie, I was, I think, about nine years old.

27:05.222 --> 27:10.108
I just finished reading his book on English book collectors.

27:14.560 --> 27:20.748
My father had some business to transact, and he was a nine-year-old boy.

27:20.768 --> 27:24.554
You had to sort of sit down and keep him quiet or happy.

27:24.574 --> 27:29.681
And so Gerritchie asked me if I liked stamps, and I said yes.

27:29.701 --> 27:32.565
So he brought down several volumes of his stamp collection.

27:32.585 --> 27:36.871
It's the most beautiful stamp collection you ever saw.

27:37.211 --> 27:43.099
And when he and Father were finished and we were leaving, he said, well, now I want it.

27:43.754 --> 27:45.556
Did you like the staff collection?"

27:45.576 --> 27:47.398
This is your father speaking, or the Richie?

27:47.718 --> 27:52.683
No, the Richie Domaine asked me whether I liked the staff.

27:52.703 --> 27:54.765
And I said, oh, they were wonderful.

27:54.785 --> 27:58.609
He said, you know, every staff in that collection is a forgery.

28:03.674 --> 28:03.754
Wow.

28:03.774 --> 28:07.618
The man was, had a mind, a memory.

28:07.638 --> 28:10.521
That's a nice story.

28:10.541 --> 28:12.563
Yeah, it's a nice story.

28:13.285 --> 28:35.673
I remember you'd ask him about some very obscure book, and he'd say, well, in 1903, I was in Mr. So-and-so's library, and he had a copy of that book.

28:35.693 --> 28:42.482
It was on the third shelf, fifth book in from the wall.

28:43.998 --> 28:46.100
And this would be 50 years later.

28:49.282 --> 28:51.725
He's a very fascinating man to Ritchie.

28:51.745 --> 28:52.825
Fascinating.

28:52.845 --> 28:53.206
Yeah.

28:53.226 --> 28:55.788
Now, he came to this country several times, of course.

28:55.848 --> 29:01.173
My father was as good a friend as he had in this country.

29:01.193 --> 29:12.722
And he was working on the census of medieval manuscripts for the Library of Congress.

29:12.742 --> 29:13.203
What did he have?

29:13.223 --> 29:13.583
I missed it.

29:13.968 --> 29:20.536
I got him.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.178
No, he got away from you.

29:22.338 --> 29:23.980
You got him?

29:24.000 --> 29:24.201
Eat him.

29:24.421 --> 29:25.282
There he is right there.

29:25.402 --> 29:25.682
Okay.

29:29.087 --> 29:30.168
What did they call that?

29:30.448 --> 29:43.384
Census of... Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts.

29:43.938 --> 29:46.182
in the United States and Canada.

29:47.985 --> 29:56.480
And somewhere out in the Middle West, DeRitchie broke down.

29:56.521 --> 29:57.542
He was hospitalized.

30:01.810 --> 30:07.380
Until he was completely recovered, he spoke only in medieval Latin.

30:09.672 --> 30:12.575
They finally brought him east for more hospitalization.

30:12.615 --> 30:13.896
My father met the train.

30:13.956 --> 30:20.342
He didn't recognize my father, but he naturally recovered.

30:23.986 --> 30:30.032
And he finally died in Paris during the war about 1944.

30:36.137 --> 30:38.920
So I really never had the personal use of his

30:39.473 --> 30:41.635
advice in anything I might have bought.

30:42.536 --> 30:47.600
But we had another friend over there named Arthur Rau, R-A-U.

30:49.182 --> 30:55.267
And Arthur Rau was the Paris representative of Max.

30:55.287 --> 31:00.592
And he and Father were very good friends, and he and I became very good friends.

31:00.612 --> 31:08.299
And I would never buy any mud air at all without Arthur passing on it.

31:08.903 --> 31:29.955
because while I'd taken a course in bibliography at Yale, taught by the university librarian, I really am not practiced enough to—not to be fooled, perhaps, by some fine points.

31:29.975 --> 31:34.602
And so I leaned very heavily on Arthur Rao for advice and a few things that I bought.

31:36.245 --> 31:37.206
As a matter of fact,

31:40.460 --> 31:53.714
One of the last things I bought in 1958 was one of over a half-dozen copies of the Money in Air Play .

31:54.455 --> 32:09.471
David, I think—well, I've forgotten right now, but the title page is one of a half a dozen title pages dated a year before the usual

32:09.974 --> 32:13.538
date which appears on the other editions of the play.

32:15.521 --> 32:19.826
And my mother said, well, son, it's a little expensive.

32:19.886 --> 32:23.009
Why don't I split the cost with you?

32:23.029 --> 32:25.572
So I cost it in her safe deposit boxes.

32:25.592 --> 32:27.094
I left that day for Europe.

32:29.517 --> 32:36.125
And I returned to the States about an hour before she died.

32:36.165 --> 32:36.285
Right.

32:40.062 --> 32:57.242
I showed this to my dear friend, Fritz Liebert, the head of the Beinecke Library, the librarian of the Beinecke, one of the great rare book figures, scholars in this country.

32:57.342 --> 33:01.227
In typical fashion, Fritz said,

33:01.477 --> 33:11.087
The story you tell me, it's a marvelous memorial to your mother, and he put it in his pocket and put it back up the nail and put it in the library before I ever had it on my own shelf.

33:13.510 --> 33:23.660
The thing is that I don't do much with Moliere.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.844
There is a so-called definitive bibliography of Moliere.

33:27.524 --> 33:30.167
I've checked it against my copies.

33:31.092 --> 33:38.301
If I had nothing else to do, I'd redo the so-called definitive bibliography and correct it.

33:39.602 --> 33:42.867
But at least it's annotated for Yale to fuss with when they get it.

33:43.728 --> 33:44.949
It's an interesting collection.

33:44.969 --> 33:57.444
For instance, that shelf, the last shelf of books on the left there, those are all British plays by famous playwrights we knew, Swift, Sharon Congreve, Leitcherly, and all that.

33:57.465 --> 33:58.686
Now, why are they there?

33:59.459 --> 34:04.407
They're all there because, in some part, each was stolen from a Moliere point.

34:05.108 --> 34:05.449
That's nice.

34:07.652 --> 34:08.033
That's a nice book.

34:08.053 --> 34:09.495
And there are even books written about it.

34:11.318 --> 34:13.702
But there they are.

34:13.722 --> 34:16.807
And then you begin to go after the first and early editions.

34:16.827 --> 34:19.311
You go into the first collected editions.

34:19.872 --> 34:20.993
Who helped form that?

34:21.113 --> 34:23.197
I mean, who advised that?

34:23.217 --> 34:24.198
De Ritchie.

34:24.218 --> 34:26.963
De Ritchie.

34:27.003 --> 34:27.103
Yeah.

34:27.809 --> 34:31.032
I mean, that's connoisseurship is what we're talking about.

34:31.052 --> 34:34.736
Yeah, that's real connoisseurship.

34:34.756 --> 34:42.685
And Father knew his books, too.

34:42.705 --> 34:49.772
And with this collection, there is a huge collection of royal French autographs, which were quite fashionable in those days.

34:50.493 --> 34:56.820
But occasionally you get a piece with some historical value in it, and they're all here.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.535
How did your father come to work with de Ritchie?

35:02.036 --> 35:05.320
I mean, I never knew how he met de Ritchie.

35:05.440 --> 35:09.145
I don't remember if I ever did, though.

35:09.165 --> 35:11.148
I mean, whoever directed him.

35:11.448 --> 35:13.110
May have been George Smith.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.293
But, I mean, you couldn't have asked for better.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.234
Oh, no.

35:16.254 --> 35:19.178
He's a very great actor.

35:19.679 --> 35:25.826
It could have been George Smith, but I was too young, I don't know, to remember.

35:25.846 --> 35:26.267
For instance.

35:29.690 --> 35:35.677
DeRitchie designed our book plate.

35:35.697 --> 35:37.299
That's your book plate?

35:37.319 --> 35:44.868
Well, it started with Father M. Father's red, mine's blue.

35:44.888 --> 35:47.552
Well, that's nice.

35:47.572 --> 35:49.434
There are a lot of DeRitchie letters.

35:50.355 --> 35:51.757
That's lovely.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.461
So, all right.

35:56.285 --> 36:03.196
Here I am, a nice, sweet, innocent, lovely boy collecting Frank Stockton.

36:03.216 --> 36:07.523
Then I did what I was in law school, from 35 to 38.

36:07.563 --> 36:13.833
Where did you go to law school?

36:14.854 --> 36:21.685
I made a very small collection, I mean a very small collection, of books on copyright law.

36:22.998 --> 36:35.054
And I had decided that if I was going to get involved with the law, I would get involved as a copyright lawman going out of the book collection, because of the early historical copyright cases.

36:35.074 --> 36:40.401
They're all of great names in the field of scholarship writing.

36:42.144 --> 36:47.611
And Yale was very good in training me up in this field.

36:47.631 --> 36:52.077
And I formed this collection of books.

36:53.457 --> 36:59.243
and stuff on copyright law, mostly 19th, 20th century.

36:59.263 --> 37:08.694
Although there's a wonderful letter on international copyright I had from James Fenimore Cooper to his forematures, and from Washington Irving to someone.

37:08.714 --> 37:09.615
A few of those things.

37:09.855 --> 37:18.064
The American Antiquarian Society just this week got the definitive Cooper collection from the Cooper family—manuscripts, letters,

37:18.635 --> 37:21.098
It hasn't been announced yet, but Mark will correct me.

37:21.118 --> 37:21.919
How did they get that?

37:21.959 --> 37:24.562
The Cooper family gave that all to Yale years ago.

37:26.124 --> 37:36.217
When I get the press release, when I talk to Mark about it, it's a major, major James Monroe Cooper collection, which will affect Bart.

37:36.257 --> 37:37.138
Cooper's a Yale man.

37:37.379 --> 37:42.445
But Bart Auerbach, you know Bart in New York, he appraised it at $650,000.

37:42.565 --> 37:43.967
Well, I would think he's one.

37:44.622 --> 37:46.824
Cooper's a Yale man.

37:46.844 --> 37:52.210
We kicked him out after a year or two.

37:52.230 --> 37:56.854
But there is a tremendous Cooper collection at Yale, manuscripts and everything.

37:56.874 --> 37:57.715
Well, you know what?

37:57.775 --> 37:58.576
I want to find out.

37:58.756 --> 37:59.437
It's interesting.

37:59.577 --> 37:59.777
Yeah.

37:59.957 --> 38:00.578
I'll let you know.

38:01.699 --> 38:04.542
So tell me now, you went to law school.

38:04.702 --> 38:06.864
I made this small copyright law collection.

38:06.884 --> 38:11.609
That same material is just one of those acquisitions sort of things.

38:11.629 --> 38:14.612
And I gave that to Yale Law School.

38:15.098 --> 38:25.428
on my 25th anniversary graduation from law school, because I wasn't using it anymore and wasn't practicing law seriously anymore.

38:26.589 --> 38:35.979
Tell me about the attraction to intelligence and government service and the building of what is a preeminent collection, from what I understand.

38:35.999 --> 38:39.082
The preeminent collection.

38:39.122 --> 38:41.925
Is that an unfair assessment of the collection?

38:41.945 --> 38:42.245
The collection.

38:42.265 --> 38:43.266
It is the collection.

38:44.107 --> 38:45.268
Capital T, right?

38:45.408 --> 38:45.769
Yeah.

38:46.469 --> 38:49.072
Well, I'll tell you about it in a minute.

38:49.212 --> 38:59.061
The thing is that the war came along, and I went into the—enlisted in the Army, because I had no right to stay out.

38:59.081 --> 39:00.041
I had no family.

39:01.203 --> 39:03.084
Did you get a commission?

39:03.104 --> 39:11.172
And after basic training, I went to Officer Kennedy School and got a commission in the Air Force after OCS.

39:11.732 --> 39:13.894
I went to Navy OCS myself.

39:14.650 --> 39:37.221
And on the 8th of December, 1942, the day of our graduation from OCS, actually a week or two before that, an officer papped me on the shoulder.

39:37.241 --> 39:41.687
He was very junior, I think, a lieutenant perhaps, maybe a captain, I doubt it.

39:44.468 --> 39:49.274
I've never seen him before, I don't know his name, and I've never seen him since.

39:49.294 --> 39:54.781
And he asked me whether I would be a minimal to going into intelligence.

39:58.105 --> 40:03.291
And Mike said yes.

40:03.311 --> 40:03.711
Mary?

40:05.814 --> 40:14.104
Mr. Tepe on the shoulder and asked if you would be able to go into intelligence.

40:14.725 --> 40:20.512
I didn't know all that much about the Air Force, except I knew I wasn't going to be flying airplanes.

40:20.532 --> 40:22.114
But I said, sure, that sounded great.

40:23.596 --> 40:24.998
You don't know how they picked you out?

40:25.839 --> 40:27.741
Well, I don't know.

40:28.702 --> 40:30.705
They were looking, among other things, for lawyers.

40:31.826 --> 40:38.995
They were looking for lawyers, for archaeologists, for photo interpretation.

40:40.561 --> 40:45.265
And so on the 8th of December— Analytical people, basically, I guess.

40:47.167 --> 40:51.631
I mean, well, whatever.

40:51.651 --> 40:59.238
I went into intelligence on that date, going off to the Air Intelligence School at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

41:02.181 --> 41:09.167
And I must say that I've been in intelligence service every day since then without a break.

41:10.008 --> 41:17.659
Even now in retirement from the agency?

41:17.880 --> 41:25.571
I'm lecturing at Defense Intelligence College once a week, conducting seminars, working on their bibliography.

41:25.591 --> 41:34.724
I've just retired now almost a year ago as chairman of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers and the nationwide organization.

41:34.744 --> 41:36.707
I sit on several intelligence boards.

41:37.379 --> 41:42.186
And occasionally I'm still consoling in the old homestead out in Langley.

41:46.613 --> 42:00.113
The career is one I must say that I have never regretted for a minute.

42:04.109 --> 42:08.614
How much can you tell me about the kind of work that you did in intelligence?

42:08.634 --> 42:19.787
Well, after hacking around the states, after coming out of OCS in the usual assistant squadron, intelligence officer assistance group, you know.

42:19.807 --> 42:28.918
I eventually went to England in 1944, and after one very brief assignment there,

42:29.590 --> 42:33.634
went on the intelligence staff of the senior air headquarters in Europe.

42:33.654 --> 42:36.538
So you're still in the Army Air Corps, not with OSS or anything?

42:36.558 --> 42:37.939
Never was with OSS.

42:41.523 --> 42:41.623
Okay.

42:41.643 --> 42:42.144
Back on.

42:44.406 --> 42:58.922
Now, I was never in OSS, but I was involved in helping to set up an OSS operation

43:01.535 --> 43:09.467
which utilized the so-called war collection of the Yale Library as a cover.

43:10.669 --> 43:11.029
Really?

43:12.992 --> 43:19.122
And without going into all the details, you'll find a whole chapter on it.

43:19.462 --> 43:20.504
In that book.

43:20.524 --> 43:27.995
In chapter three of a very, very good book by Professor Robin Winks.

43:28.536 --> 43:29.938
Well, where are they all?

43:30.205 --> 43:31.247
cloak and gown.

43:31.647 --> 43:33.731
Okay, I'll get that at Harvard.

43:34.732 --> 43:35.854
I do my archival.

43:35.874 --> 43:37.096
What's next to her?

43:37.116 --> 43:37.997
I'm sorry.

43:38.097 --> 43:40.461
You must go slumber.

43:40.481 --> 43:40.922
Anyway.

43:40.962 --> 43:42.845
They don't have bad things there.

43:43.726 --> 43:46.811
I'm honored to be a co-dedicate of Robin's book.

43:46.831 --> 43:47.132
Oh, great.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.076
I wonder why there were three copies of it there.

43:50.096 --> 43:51.759
When was that published, by the way?

43:51.779 --> 43:54.243
A couple years ago.

43:54.263 --> 43:58.069
I don't think it's in the bibliography yet.

44:00.327 --> 44:04.873
I'll get that in Worcester.

44:04.893 --> 44:05.594
Okay, good.

44:05.614 --> 44:08.197
Yeah.

44:08.217 --> 44:11.482
Tomorrow I can see the publisher, too.

44:11.502 --> 44:12.964
Okay, so chapter three.

44:13.424 --> 44:15.487
Yeah, which is the Yale Library project.

44:15.507 --> 44:20.053
There are lots of interesting—you on here?

44:20.273 --> 44:21.255
Yep.

44:21.335 --> 44:22.416
Yes, sir.

44:22.436 --> 44:22.937
Oh, yeah.

44:22.957 --> 44:27.583
There are a lot of interesting side stories about that project, which

44:31.462 --> 44:33.724
just barely touches on.

44:34.565 --> 44:46.298
But no one at Yale, except those handling the project, knew about it until it was blown by some writer in 1950, roughly.

44:50.042 --> 44:51.183
And were they surprised.

44:54.587 --> 44:57.790
And the money was channeled through me as a trustee of the library.

44:58.445 --> 45:01.188
on behalf of myself and some fellow alumni.

45:01.448 --> 45:02.689
How did you feel about that?

45:03.310 --> 45:04.210
I thought it was fine.

45:04.231 --> 45:09.676
If that's the way they wanted to do it, that's all right with me.

45:11.517 --> 45:22.428
Because I left Roaster Yes two or three days after the thing had been set up, my father ran the accounts and books for the rest of the war.

45:23.669 --> 45:26.832
He was cleared to be in the know on that.

45:27.065 --> 45:30.830
project and ran the books.

45:30.850 --> 45:37.640
All the documents and papers are up at Yale now.

45:37.660 --> 45:40.885
And once in a while you get a chance even in wartime to collect.

45:40.925 --> 45:52.522
You know, there are people who have books around that they aren't going to need anymore, and occasionally you tend to borrow one perhaps.

45:52.542 --> 45:53.443
And that happened to me, yeah.

46:00.663 --> 46:08.052
I was in a fellow's office, and I saw some books he didn't need.

46:08.292 --> 46:10.615
I took five of them, actually.

46:14.580 --> 46:14.980
Oh, my.

46:15.361 --> 46:17.804
Oh, my goodness.

46:17.824 --> 46:19.105
Well, he didn't need it anymore.

46:19.586 --> 46:21.508
Ex Libris, Adolf Hitler.

46:23.210 --> 46:24.151
Isn't it?

46:24.171 --> 46:25.733
This is an inscription by Hitler?

46:25.833 --> 46:28.797
No, that's the author, the great Peter.

46:29.688 --> 46:31.711
Yeah, but it's got Hitler's book plate.

46:31.731 --> 46:32.813
Yeah, to Hitler's.

46:33.113 --> 46:34.776
Yeah, they inscribed the book and gave it to me.

46:34.796 --> 46:38.761
This book comes out of Hitler's office.

46:39.022 --> 46:40.824
K-A-M-T-F.

46:41.025 --> 46:43.388
That's kind of battle.

46:43.408 --> 46:48.496
How do we spell T-H-U-R-A-N-T.

46:49.537 --> 46:53.543
A novel of the 13th century.

46:53.563 --> 46:56.307
By Robert Palmers.

46:56.568 --> 46:58.851
A-L-L-M-E-R, I'll say.

46:59.624 --> 47:07.671
It was inscribed by the author to the Fuhrer in Berlin in March 1933.

47:07.711 --> 47:09.253
Where'd you get this?

47:09.313 --> 47:09.913
Very early on.

47:10.394 --> 47:15.538
I took this out of Hitler's office in the Reichskanzlei in Berlin.

47:15.558 --> 47:17.320
How'd you get into Hitler's office?

47:17.340 --> 47:18.361
That's part of my job.

47:20.783 --> 47:24.066
Then you figure what the hell made.

47:24.306 --> 47:27.829
They were lying around.

47:28.369 --> 47:28.990
What are you going to do?

47:30.303 --> 47:31.324
He said, what are you going to do?

47:31.344 --> 47:31.925
Leave him there.

47:32.085 --> 47:34.427
I want that to get on the tape.

47:34.447 --> 47:41.735
Surely I was in Gehring's place in Air Ministry, in the headquarters of Air Ministry.

47:41.755 --> 47:57.552
And this is a phone book from the minister-president of the city of Berlin, which he was, General Field Marshal Gehring, of phone numbers from his office in Berlin.

47:57.572 --> 47:57.812
Really?

47:58.501 --> 48:01.986
to his home in Caron Hall in East Prussia.

48:03.589 --> 48:07.174
And with some notes that he made, there's a piece of his stationery.

48:08.636 --> 48:12.542
Now, I wouldn't touch this stuff if I thought he needed it anymore, but I knew he didn't.

48:13.463 --> 48:14.745
So what can you do?

48:14.785 --> 48:16.648
He was indisposed at the time.

48:16.908 --> 48:19.412
Yeah.

48:25.771 --> 48:30.677
I think about five of them.

48:30.758 --> 48:31.939
I've got two of them left.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.501
One's at Yale, I think.

48:34.803 --> 48:43.594
A friend borrowed one in exchange for having sent me on temporary duty to Berlin.

48:44.916 --> 48:46.358
And I gave one to somebody else.

48:46.438 --> 48:49.222
Anyway, I guess maybe I gave one to the Gordier Club.

48:49.442 --> 48:50.083
Five or six of them.

48:50.103 --> 48:51.245
With Hitler's book plays?

48:51.265 --> 48:51.365
Yeah.

48:52.026 --> 48:53.427
They were great curiosities.

48:53.447 --> 48:55.390
I guess.

48:55.690 --> 48:58.072
It would have been nicer if we signed them.

48:58.333 --> 49:00.375
No, no, no, I mean if Hitler had signed them.

49:00.815 --> 49:09.644
You know, good Hitler signatures are hard to come by, because usually they use a rubber stand, a very good one.

49:09.664 --> 49:22.997
But I do have one of the commissions to Albert Speer, with his Minister of Production, of course you'd want to call it in the end.

49:23.467 --> 49:32.500
One of the commissions that Spear had and one of the jobs they did, signed by Hitler, and it's a good signature.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.102
For real, very neurotic.

49:34.122 --> 49:35.764
It's worth big bucks.

49:35.784 --> 49:35.945
Hmm?

49:36.005 --> 49:40.311
Hitler is worth a lot of money, and not that we should let money into this.

49:40.331 --> 49:45.157
Well, sell it for what it cost me, which is zero.

49:45.258 --> 49:51.927
But I knew if I didn't take it into custody, somebody else would misuse it.

49:51.947 --> 49:53.389
I didn't want that to happen.

49:54.466 --> 49:57.771
I think we're talking here about basically valueless things.

49:58.972 --> 50:00.995
I mean— Unless you're a book collector.

50:01.015 --> 50:02.758
Unless you're a book collector.

50:02.778 --> 50:03.539
That's right.

50:03.559 --> 50:06.603
I think we have to—I have to make this point.

50:06.623 --> 50:07.765
Your nickel.

50:07.785 --> 50:09.207
My nickel, okay.

50:09.227 --> 50:24.388
Well, I come home, and in February of 46, I'm asked to join the newly established Central Intelligence Group, which at that point was about two weeks old.

50:26.123 --> 50:50.140
the first deputy director of CIG, Kingman Douglas, Yale, 1918, I believe, who had been the senior air intelligence officer in British air ministry during the war, American air intelligence officer, in liaison in air ministry during the war, asked me to come in and help set up, and I did.

50:53.596 --> 50:57.421
As I say, I've been in this game ever since, and I've never regretted it.

50:58.543 --> 51:19.792
But what I found in CIG, particularly after about August of, from August of 46 on, was that I was surrounded, as it were, by a goodly number of veteran OSS officers.

51:20.072 --> 51:21.915
I didn't know beans about OSS.

51:22.283 --> 51:26.069
except for that project on health set up back in 1943.

51:29.454 --> 51:35.483
What does the G mean in CIG, by the way?

51:35.543 --> 51:35.823
Group.

51:36.464 --> 51:40.250
Central Intelligence Group?

51:40.270 --> 51:40.370
Yeah.

51:40.390 --> 51:51.126
And one of the interesting things that happened, being a lawyer, I was the one person there who sort of

51:52.642 --> 52:02.619
saw that there was going to be congressional interest in the group, and that the group would also have an interest in the Congress in getting appropriations and the like.

52:03.560 --> 52:13.316
And one reason or another, I kept discussing this with the director and his executive officer, deputy.

52:13.336 --> 52:19.206
And about August of 46, I became CIG's first legislative counsel.

52:20.452 --> 52:32.189
And I was in that job for ten years, getting all their basic legislation through the Congress and handling all of their relations with the Congress.

52:32.209 --> 52:49.935
Now, surrounded by all these folks from OSS, whether we're talking Dick Helms, Alan Dulles, people whose names aren't going to ring any bells,

52:50.776 --> 53:03.675
I didn't know very much about it, and there were beginning to be a few books, even as early as 46, 47, about OSS in particular, or something of that order.

53:04.776 --> 53:07.540
And I bought them, you know, at any bookstore.

53:08.041 --> 53:09.784
I bought them.

53:09.804 --> 53:13.469
I didn't ever mean to collect or anything.

53:13.489 --> 53:14.691
But it was your profession now?

53:14.791 --> 53:16.193
It was my profession.

53:16.342 --> 53:20.288
These were my associates, and I'd better know something more about all it says than I did.

53:22.331 --> 53:26.077
And so I read these things—magazine articles.

53:27.439 --> 53:28.200
Goodwin said it.

53:32.326 --> 53:45.606
And then some of my bookseller friends caught on to me and began shoving me back in time towards

53:46.328 --> 53:50.995
books on intelligence in World War I and the Civil War.

53:52.538 --> 54:00.931
And I remember Dave Randall, for instance, at Scribner's, later the librarian at the Lilly Library at the University of Indiana.

54:01.412 --> 54:03.255
You were going up to the Lilly, by the way.

54:03.335 --> 54:11.087
And Dave was a good friend of mine and always treated me very, very well, as many booksellers do to there.

54:11.728 --> 54:14.072
You wrote an interesting book, by the way, Randall.

54:14.092 --> 54:14.192
Yeah.

54:15.978 --> 54:28.332
And old Dave sold me a book called Spy of the Rebellion by Alan Pinkerton.

54:28.352 --> 54:32.997
Beautiful copy with that Pinkerton eye on the front cover over there.

54:33.358 --> 54:34.980
Yeah, this is the Civil War.

54:35.220 --> 54:35.641
Yeah.

54:36.001 --> 54:38.063
So they got me back to the Civil War.

54:40.726 --> 54:42.188
One day I was in New York.

54:43.028 --> 54:46.092
Do you think, pardon me, but were they aware that they were building a collection?

54:46.132 --> 54:46.552
No.

54:47.033 --> 54:50.497
Neither was I. No way.

54:50.857 --> 54:52.439
I had no intention of building a book.

54:52.459 --> 54:53.721
But you were, though.

54:53.741 --> 54:55.803
Get a book from the Civil War and WW1.

54:55.823 --> 54:56.744
Come on.

54:59.728 --> 55:00.649
Curiosity.

55:00.789 --> 55:04.193
Okay.

55:04.213 --> 55:05.335
I was up in New York.

55:05.355 --> 55:06.837
Well, you brought these to read, then?

55:07.077 --> 55:07.557
Yeah.

55:07.577 --> 55:09.320
Okay.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.382
One often does read books.

55:11.885 --> 55:15.289
But I mean, you were buying them— I wasn't buying them as collections.

55:15.329 --> 55:17.912
You were buying them as individuals?

55:19.254 --> 55:20.716
No.

55:20.736 --> 55:27.564
And so then, one day, I was up in New York.

55:29.266 --> 55:41.301
I went by to see my old friend Bill McCarthy, who had been in the Rebel Room at Yale when I was a freshman and sophomore, then going on to the University of Texas Library under Fannie Ratchard.

55:42.867 --> 55:48.395
and eventually ended up as one of the people at Rosenbach.

55:51.339 --> 55:54.003
And I went in to see Bill.

55:54.103 --> 55:57.188
I guess he asked me to come and see him for something.

55:57.208 --> 56:11.068
What he had was a little document on an intelligence collection statement in the New York Revolution.

56:13.006 --> 56:29.995
It wasn't much of a document, except today it has some significance in that it was signed by Jonathan Dayton, who is, I think, the only signer of the Constitution with intelligence experience direct.

56:33.320 --> 56:37.027
And it was nothing to write home about.

56:37.047 --> 56:39.030
It was a $35 document.

56:55.075 --> 56:58.599
for a second.

56:59.561 --> 57:01.123
No, that's not important.

57:01.723 --> 57:05.728
It's just a little piece of paper.

57:05.748 --> 57:16.201
I was just about to leave when McCarthy said to me, just a minute, he said, I think I have something here you might be interested in.

57:16.221 --> 57:21.488
He laid on the table before me a letter

57:22.953 --> 57:30.179
dated 1777 to Colonel Elias Dayton, who was Washington's intelligence chief in New Jersey.

57:33.922 --> 57:51.277
And without going into great detail, this letter has a last paragraph on it, which is now quoted by, or misquoted by, countless people who are writing or talking.

57:51.297 --> 57:51.998
And it reads,

57:53.108 --> 58:00.118
The necessity of procuring good intelligence is apparent and need not be further urged.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.050
All that remains for me to add is that you keep the whole matter as secret as possible.

58:10.773 --> 58:15.479
For upon secrecy, success depends in most enterprises of the kind.

58:17.222 --> 58:22.609
And for one of them,

58:23.315 --> 58:29.462
They are generally defeated, however well planned and promising a favorable issue.

58:30.323 --> 58:34.708
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, G. Washington.

58:36.771 --> 58:41.757
Now, here's this thing laying on the green baize on the table in front of you.

58:41.777 --> 58:42.958
This is about 1950.

58:43.278 --> 58:45.061
Oh, my God.

58:46.502 --> 58:53.170
And we're now, unfortunately, at what you call the make-or-break point.

58:53.808 --> 58:55.511
Do you or don't you collect?

58:57.714 --> 59:05.947
I had never started collecting books on intelligence qua collection until I was faced with this document.

59:07.149 --> 59:07.830
And what do you do?

59:09.272 --> 59:10.895
Well, there's no question of what you do.

59:10.915 --> 59:13.559
You just cannot let something like that go by.

59:16.323 --> 59:17.866
May I ask what it cost you?

59:18.206 --> 59:18.627
Sure.

59:19.448 --> 59:21.852
I will tell you.

59:21.892 --> 59:21.992
Okay.

59:23.778 --> 59:27.281
I never discuss Brides, normally.

59:27.301 --> 59:29.583
G. Washington.

59:29.603 --> 59:30.944
I'm just writing it down here.

59:30.964 --> 59:32.726
G. Washington.

59:32.746 --> 59:42.835
The thing is— And to whom, by the way, once again was this— Colonel Elias, later Brigadier, Colonel Elias Dayton in New Jersey.

59:42.915 --> 59:45.377
Congratulations, that's a wonderful document.

59:45.397 --> 59:47.459
Well, that's a document.

59:47.479 --> 59:47.999
What do you do?

59:48.039 --> 59:50.441
Here it is, something like that.

59:50.521 --> 59:52.163
That's an artifact, actually.

59:52.183 --> 59:52.283
Yeah.

59:53.832 --> 59:55.735
That actually sets the course, doesn't it?

59:55.755 --> 59:57.197
I mean— If you're going to go.

59:58.279 --> 01:00:01.243
I don't mean just for you, I mean also for the apparatus that follows.

01:00:01.263 --> 01:00:02.886
Oh, heavens yes.

01:00:02.906 --> 01:00:03.707
Yeah.

01:00:03.727 --> 01:00:10.036
No, this document, which we've occasionally used on Capitol Hill— I would think.

01:00:10.056 --> 01:00:19.110
That last paragraph, as Director of Central Intelligence, the great General Walter Beatle-Smith said— I've seen Washington things go at auction.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:19.610
Yeah.

01:00:19.631 --> 01:00:22.134
If you have some idea what that might fetch— Today?

01:00:22.174 --> 01:00:22.695
Yeah.

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:23.316
Goodbye.

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:25.677
I mean, I happen to know.

01:00:25.737 --> 01:00:29.261
I saw Washington's copy of the Federalist Papers sell for 1.5.

01:00:29.281 --> 01:00:32.926
1.5, plus 10 percent.

01:00:32.946 --> 01:00:35.810
Yeah, I saw it go, too.

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.014
That was not what I would go for in that sale.

01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:45.922
I would have gone if I had money to play with, with that archive of 221 pieces with Lord Sterling.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.224
That was nice stuff.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:51.309
Because this letter is about Lord Sterling's division.

01:00:51.329 --> 01:00:52.290
Who got that, do you know?

01:00:52.675 --> 01:00:54.217
Who secured that?

01:00:54.297 --> 01:00:55.098
No, I don't know.

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:58.561
I think it's in the press.

01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:00.564
It's in the newspaper.

01:01:00.584 --> 01:01:02.426
It didn't impress me one way or the other.

01:01:02.506 --> 01:01:06.090
I think it was a dealer, actually, in an undisclosed or whatever.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.791
Yeah.

01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:10.114
So you got it.

01:01:11.075 --> 01:01:12.236
You got it, obviously.

01:01:12.376 --> 01:01:13.437
Obviously I got it.

01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:14.519
And you are now committed.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:15.780
Now I am committed.

01:01:17.702 --> 01:01:19.724
Did you walk out of there knowing you were committed?

01:01:21.446 --> 01:01:22.227
I don't remember.

01:01:22.662 --> 01:01:27.647
Prior to that day, you had a library of a very interesting resource material.

01:01:27.667 --> 01:01:31.010
When you walked out of that office— Not an intelligence.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:33.012
But you had been gathering materials.

01:01:33.072 --> 01:01:35.334
Well, let's say I had done books.

01:01:35.855 --> 01:01:38.798
But now you had— Now you're in deep, deep trouble.

01:01:39.018 --> 01:01:40.439
And taken a collection.

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:44.964
What President Bush calls the deep doo-doo.

01:01:44.984 --> 01:01:51.690
I remember being in Vice President Bush's office once, and I'd worked with him out at the agency.

01:01:52.666 --> 01:02:01.861
And after we'd finished talking about what he wanted to talk to me about, I quoted this last paragraph to him, which he'd never heard.

01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:08.533
By the way, I'd like the record to show that you did that from memory.

01:02:08.553 --> 01:02:10.115
I always did that one from memory.

01:02:10.155 --> 01:02:10.857
You really didn't.

01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:15.284
You have the copy of the letter in your lap, but you did it from memory.

01:02:15.404 --> 01:02:15.785
I did.

01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:18.910
And I quoted that last paragraph to it.

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:24.648
I had guessed something, and I happened to have it in my briefcase, and I showed it to him.

01:02:25.128 --> 01:02:26.630
You carried that out there?

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:27.130
Oh, no.

01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:29.473
To the way I described it.

01:02:29.493 --> 01:02:30.655
I think so, yeah.

01:02:30.755 --> 01:02:33.077
But he was so excited.

01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:40.186
I mean, he shot out of his chair and took it out and showed it to his colleagues in the vice president's office.

01:02:41.247 --> 01:02:42.689
You can have a lot of trouble with something like that.

01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:45.392
Where again did you get this, by the way, from home?

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:46.093
Rosenbach.

01:02:46.113 --> 01:02:47.274
This was Rosenbach.

01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:49.116
From Bill McCarthy.

01:02:50.024 --> 01:02:57.047
Rosenbach was working for... McCarthy was working for Fleming.
