WEBVTT

00:03.625 --> 00:05.387
So tell me where we are right now.

00:05.407 --> 00:09.072
Yes, on the first floor with the Rangel apartment.

00:09.092 --> 00:14.159
That was the first apartment that was ready here.

00:15.040 --> 00:19.927
Most of the pieces of furniture from the 17th century.

00:19.947 --> 00:24.293
So if you want to, we could take a walk.

00:24.333 --> 00:28.418
Yes, we can have a look at it too.

00:30.187 --> 00:34.391
And this material that you gave me gives us a pretty good history of this, right?

00:34.511 --> 00:35.012
Yes, yes, yes.

00:35.032 --> 00:37.054
So I don't have to write down all the history that you're talking about.

00:37.074 --> 00:37.955
No, no, no, no, not at all.

00:38.135 --> 00:46.744
Because there is a, yes, a really good book in English, but everything you want to know about it.

00:46.764 --> 00:49.486
Because I like to see instead of just taking notes.

00:50.007 --> 00:50.788
Enjoying knowledge.

00:50.948 --> 00:51.208
Yes.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.232
Oh, my.

01:00.173 --> 01:02.517
And this is a 300-year-old building, right?

01:02.537 --> 01:03.098
It reads?

01:03.238 --> 01:04.841
Yes, more than 300.

01:05.782 --> 01:08.547
And here is Colbert Baranin.

01:10.671 --> 01:17.382
That was in 1651 when he was a Count of Salmis in Finland.

01:17.923 --> 01:21.709
He was General Governor of Swedish Pomerania.

01:21.892 --> 01:27.341
And, yes, he had the best part of his career behind him, actually.

01:27.861 --> 01:30.045
He was born 1613.

01:33.270 --> 01:37.557
So he was not 40 years old, but... And he's the person who established this?

01:37.577 --> 01:38.979
Yes, yes, yes.

01:38.999 --> 01:42.405
He was born in the stone house, the side house.

01:42.425 --> 01:43.326
Right here, yeah.

01:43.694 --> 01:49.561
And his father had got that building together with the estate out here.

01:50.042 --> 01:52.344
It was after the time of the nunnery.

01:53.225 --> 01:54.887
Is that a contemporary painting?

01:55.027 --> 01:56.089
Yes, it is, yes.

01:56.729 --> 02:03.798
And the painter was David KlÃ¶cke Ehrenstrahl, who was a quite important painter in Sweden at that time.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.083
Okay, excellent.

02:08.163 --> 02:11.747
And there is a picture of that portrait in the book too.

02:11.767 --> 02:12.368
Oh, good, excellent.

02:13.529 --> 02:18.516
And his wife, she came from the north of Germany.

02:18.936 --> 02:24.684
She was a quite poor lady, from a noble family, but not a family of counts.

02:24.704 --> 02:28.468
So Kondistarana's father, he was quite disappointed.

02:29.049 --> 02:38.862
He was even angry because he wanted his son to marry a Swedish countess or a daughter of a Jew or something like that.

02:39.247 --> 02:43.334
But they lived together until she died and had 11 children.

02:43.354 --> 02:43.915
Had 11 children.

02:44.596 --> 02:45.297
Did she die young?

02:45.858 --> 02:47.541
No, no, she was quite old.

02:47.581 --> 02:51.948
She died when she was about 60 years old.

02:52.930 --> 02:55.034
She had had so many children.

02:55.094 --> 02:56.075
How do you say that?

02:56.236 --> 02:57.257
That's why I asked the question.

02:57.598 --> 03:00.463
And all these devices, these are all contemporary to the period?

03:00.503 --> 03:01.845
Yes, oh yes, they are.

03:02.197 --> 03:03.919
They were already about 1665.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.745
And they are covered with wood.

03:08.466 --> 03:09.488
That's quite remarkable.

03:10.068 --> 03:15.737
But that was an idea that Carl de Stavrangen had seen in France.

03:16.177 --> 03:17.018
They did it like that.

03:17.319 --> 03:18.020
What did you call it?

03:19.141 --> 03:23.007
They called it a fireplace.

03:27.323 --> 03:29.987
And in the corner, an oven.

03:30.788 --> 03:34.313
That was the best way to use the room, to use that one.

03:36.876 --> 03:37.818
Excellent.

03:37.838 --> 03:39.440
And then... This is the entry room?

03:39.480 --> 03:40.241
What room is this?

03:40.401 --> 03:47.692
Yes, this is an empty room where the guests could wait for Carl Gustav Ragnar.

03:47.712 --> 03:48.793
Room for reception.

03:48.913 --> 03:49.755
Reception room.

03:50.255 --> 03:50.396
Yes.

03:50.576 --> 03:52.458
And this is on what floor, the first floor?

03:52.679 --> 03:53.480
Are we on now?

03:53.520 --> 03:55.002
Yes, this is the first floor, yes.

03:55.471 --> 04:03.300
You see in the ground floor there were only kitchens.

04:06.444 --> 04:07.906
Service level in a way.

04:11.550 --> 04:17.277
And then tapestries of golden leather.

04:18.438 --> 04:20.800
Do you, by the way, this is open to the public?

04:20.901 --> 04:21.481
Oh, yes, it is.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.503
And is all that in the material that you gave me?

04:23.583 --> 04:23.864
Yes.

04:23.884 --> 04:30.210
Because I will publish this in a magazine piece, and you might get some business out of it.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.171
Oh, yes.

04:31.292 --> 04:32.233
It's all public.

04:32.253 --> 04:34.535
The library isn't.

04:34.555 --> 04:36.337
But groups can come here.

04:36.397 --> 04:38.900
You can order a visit.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.321
Well, that's good.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.563
I'll make that point clear in the piece, too.

04:43.765 --> 04:44.165
Great.

04:44.185 --> 04:45.487
This is nice.

04:45.507 --> 04:45.947
Tackle.

04:46.366 --> 04:48.149
It's like a time capsule, isn't it?

04:48.309 --> 04:48.710
Yes.

04:48.730 --> 04:49.751
It's not like a museum.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.335
It really is like a house that hasn't changed.

04:52.355 --> 04:55.500
You see, the daughter called Savania, she inherited the gospel.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.201
It's unbelievable.

04:56.221 --> 04:59.246
Yes, and she decided... It's really boring.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.769
It's really something.

05:00.789 --> 05:06.417
It was decided to be a museum at the beginning of the 18th century, actually.

05:06.758 --> 05:06.838
Wow.

05:07.561 --> 05:09.003
And this room you would call what?

05:09.103 --> 05:18.254
Yes, it started to be a dining room, but now we call it the King's Hall because there are Swedish kings and kings all around the walls here.

05:18.274 --> 05:18.695
Absolutely.

05:19.335 --> 05:22.039
Are there pictures of these that you gave me?

05:22.059 --> 05:23.460
So I don't have to take any photographs.

05:23.480 --> 05:32.051
No, no, I think if they are okay for you, I think you can use them.

05:32.431 --> 05:35.555
This flash isn't sufficient to get anything decent out of here.

05:35.575 --> 05:36.336
It's just a waste of time.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.117
effort, not just the film.

05:39.658 --> 05:45.224
It wouldn't do any justice to what we're looking at here.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.685
This is really interesting.

05:47.386 --> 05:51.090
This is the reception room of the countess.

05:52.452 --> 05:57.657
So she has got her rooms on this side of the dining room and the count on the other side.

05:57.677 --> 06:04.284
Does the book explain who these people were in the scheme of things?

06:04.425 --> 06:05.766
Yes.

06:06.438 --> 06:08.340
Monarchs of Sweden, right?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.062
This was a noble family.

06:10.402 --> 06:14.086
Yes, a family of great importance at that time.

06:14.106 --> 06:15.128
Quite obviously, yes.

06:15.468 --> 06:17.851
With lots of power and so on.

06:17.931 --> 06:21.535
But in the king's service, so to speak, that's why they could have their father.

06:21.695 --> 06:24.858
Is that a contemporary portrait of Gustavus Adolfus?

06:25.079 --> 06:28.222
Yes, Gustavus Adolfus, that's on guilt level too.

06:29.804 --> 06:31.345
Could that have been a portrait of him?

06:31.786 --> 06:33.728
Yes, could have been.

06:35.058 --> 06:36.741
What is the material on the wall here?

06:36.761 --> 06:37.382
That's letter.

06:37.402 --> 06:37.903
That's letter.

06:38.103 --> 06:39.085
Letter from Kaff.

06:40.227 --> 06:40.347
Guilt.

06:40.848 --> 06:43.212
Guilt's letter from Kaff on the wall.

06:43.272 --> 06:43.612
Wow.

06:44.193 --> 06:47.579
I think the fabrication was in Holland at that time.

06:47.959 --> 06:52.527
Kogestavangel bought those wall hangs from Holland.

06:54.835 --> 07:03.347
But it was not in fashion in the 18th century and in other causes they took it away, but in Skogloster they were preserved and they are still hanging here.

07:03.367 --> 07:05.209
So there must have been a picture hanging over that?

07:05.249 --> 07:07.332
Yes, that's right.

07:07.993 --> 07:11.097
And up there it was a very good black color.

07:11.117 --> 07:13.160
Yes, because there's no sun hitting it.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.582
No, no, that's right.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.261
Same thing with books.

07:17.263 --> 07:30.079
Some of them are Italian but they also come from Holland, even Swedish.

07:30.459 --> 07:33.223
How much of the glass on the windows would you say is original?

07:33.924 --> 07:35.686
Nothing on this floor.

07:36.627 --> 07:43.776
Higher up in the library there could be a few parts left from the 17th century but nothing here.

07:44.752 --> 07:55.622
It says something though about the strength of the glass that they made, if some of it is managed at least to... Oh my, this is a royal bedroom, right?

07:56.063 --> 07:59.326
Yes, but that's for the Countess Rangel.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.067
I wonder if the bed was comfortable.

08:02.028 --> 08:04.391
Not that I propose crying it, I'm just curious.

08:04.991 --> 08:14.320
And here's one of the towers with a small exhibition with small pieces of silver and

08:15.346 --> 08:21.112
and so on.

08:21.132 --> 08:22.934
What is the material on the wall?

08:22.954 --> 08:24.976
This is like a stucco or a plaster?

08:25.056 --> 08:26.237
It's brick inside.

08:26.257 --> 08:26.638
It's brick.

08:26.658 --> 08:27.639
It's all made of brick.

08:27.659 --> 08:29.341
Brick with a plaster on top of it.

08:29.361 --> 08:29.521
Yes.

08:30.842 --> 08:33.245
That's right.

08:33.265 --> 08:33.926
Any questions up here?

08:34.106 --> 08:40.913
Most of the rooms on this floor, the ceilings are covered with stucco, but here it was uncovered.

08:40.933 --> 08:44.897
And this room was used as a wardrobe.

08:45.198 --> 08:49.162
at the time of Rangel, so it wasn't so important to make it nice.

08:51.985 --> 08:54.828
And are these cases, these must have been put in late?

08:54.848 --> 08:55.950
Yes, oh yes, about 1930.

09:00.254 --> 09:03.518
Look at the door, though.

09:04.659 --> 09:06.061
The ceiling, yeah.

09:06.261 --> 09:07.642
What kind of wood do you think that is?

09:07.742 --> 09:12.147
It must just be a local... It's hard to say.

09:14.089 --> 09:14.850
But it sure has been.

09:15.252 --> 09:19.918
It's held up pretty well.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.941
Could be okay.

09:22.041 --> 09:36.341
A documentary film, a little film.

09:36.542 --> 09:42.610
It's about restoring on paintings.

09:47.011 --> 09:59.012
So this is pretty much the way it would have felt to the

09:59.583 --> 10:02.106
Because there's no heating here.

10:02.307 --> 10:03.188
No, no heating.

10:03.508 --> 10:04.930
Only on the ground floor.

10:05.270 --> 10:10.077
And the ground floor is heated since 1930, not earlier.

10:10.097 --> 10:13.321
But whatever we feel is the way they felt it, in other words.

10:13.341 --> 10:14.723
Yes, yes, definitely.

10:14.743 --> 10:20.871
But in wintertime, Carl de Servanio preferred to stay in Pomerania or in Stockholm.

10:20.951 --> 10:24.195
He had a castle in Stockholm.

10:24.315 --> 10:28.881
Just translate for me what that says up there.

10:29.063 --> 10:41.538
I don't remember.

10:42.098 --> 10:44.161
It doesn't identify what's in there.

10:44.221 --> 10:49.407
No, these are just words of wisdom in different languages.

10:49.747 --> 10:56.455
And there are words of wisdom all around here in different languages.

10:57.177 --> 11:01.462
These are all tributes to members of the family?

11:01.902 --> 11:03.024
Yes, you mean those portraits?

11:03.084 --> 11:04.906
These portraits and these little sayings?

11:04.926 --> 11:10.973
Yes, those portraits, they are older, they are from the beginning of the 17th century.

11:10.993 --> 11:24.248
So we think they were placed in the stone halls before, and they were taken up because those men, they were officer comrades to Hermann Rangel, the father of Karl Gustav Rangel.

11:24.565 --> 11:28.156
And this painting on the ceilings is contemporary to the period too?

11:28.196 --> 11:29.259
Yes, it is, yes.

11:29.279 --> 11:35.317
So there's no attempt, and I think I quite agree, to try and restore any of this to any of its... No, no.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.263
You leave it just the way it was?

11:37.283 --> 11:38.828
We leave it just the way it is.

11:44.157 --> 11:47.781
I see.

11:47.801 --> 11:55.471
But it was changed in the 18th century.

11:55.531 --> 12:13.472
A little quarter right up here.

12:15.325 --> 12:17.127
Yes, yes.

12:17.848 --> 12:20.892
You see it came from a book made in Rome.

12:21.733 --> 12:24.577
Oh, these little sayings.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.339
Little sayings of wisdom.

12:26.359 --> 12:34.350
Villa Benedetti, and it was born, born.

12:34.370 --> 12:35.712
Does the guidebook mention this?

12:36.132 --> 12:36.993
Mention these things?

12:37.234 --> 12:37.915
Yes.

12:38.135 --> 12:39.036
I don't have to write down.

12:39.096 --> 12:39.797
No, no.

12:43.203 --> 12:52.736
There's one that says something like, the farmer is... We might call them little platitudes of wisdom, right?

12:52.756 --> 12:54.137
Yes, exactly.

12:54.157 --> 13:05.032
They are in Swedish and they are really platitudes.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.153
And this would have been destroyed.

13:06.534 --> 13:11.320
So Sweden had a period of wealth in the 17th century and that was it.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.062
You think it would have been destroyed?

13:13.262 --> 13:14.343
Oh, they would have been restored.

13:14.363 --> 13:16.766
Oh, they would have been modernized, yeah, many times.

13:17.286 --> 13:22.032
Because if you look at the Italian houses in Rome, they are in the 18th or 19th century.

13:22.192 --> 13:31.903
It's kind of, for me, it's like going in to see Samuel Pepys's library, which hasn't been touched in 350 years.

13:32.543 --> 13:35.847
And that's just the exciting thing, isn't it?

13:35.907 --> 13:36.868
It's a time capsule.

13:37.793 --> 13:39.415
This is another apartment, right?

13:39.435 --> 13:40.316
This is another apartment.

13:41.017 --> 13:49.026
And it got its interior at the beginning of the 18th century, mainly.

13:49.767 --> 13:58.717
Kolkostarganger's eldest daughter inherited the castle, and she was married to a man from the first Swedish noble family, Count Brahe.

13:59.598 --> 14:04.864
So this family, the Brahe family, they owned Skoklostrand in 1930.

14:06.093 --> 14:12.280
And this apartment got its interior at that time.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.263
So there is some electricity in here.

14:14.483 --> 14:16.165
I can see there's a cord over there.

14:16.185 --> 14:26.757
Yes, that's right.

14:26.777 --> 14:27.718
How long have you worked here?

14:28.780 --> 14:31.343
Oh, more than 20 years.

14:31.363 --> 14:32.244
Mostly with the books?

14:32.444 --> 14:33.265
Yes, yes.

14:33.987 --> 14:35.089
And so you're a librarian?

14:35.269 --> 14:36.692
Yes, I'm a librarian.

14:38.315 --> 14:43.465
So I came here at the beginning of the 1970s.

14:43.485 --> 14:45.047
This looks much more recent.

14:45.067 --> 14:52.401
Yes, oh yes, that's from the 19th century, when the Brau family had dinners here in this room.

14:52.820 --> 14:56.184
So this actually had people living in it, though, for several hundred years?

14:56.345 --> 14:56.965
Yes, yes.

14:57.606 --> 15:03.974
And you see, the last family, we have got three families at Skokloster, the Wrange family, the Brauer family, and the Fonessen family.

15:05.056 --> 15:09.081
And the Fonessen family, they had only Skokloster, if I say so.

15:09.101 --> 15:10.663
They had only one castle.

15:10.883 --> 15:14.528
So they lived in the castle all around the year.

15:15.890 --> 15:18.173
The other families had several castles.

15:21.738 --> 15:22.118
Yeah.

15:22.992 --> 15:48.628
you can see it's uh my wife is going to come when i tell her the things that i see her

15:49.199 --> 16:13.620
and that is it was chilly up here they had some special fuel for winter living with uh with the lower what did they do for recreation here did they have

16:14.377 --> 16:16.179
Outside, they have horses and things?

16:16.320 --> 16:19.664
Yes, there was a stable down here.

16:19.824 --> 16:21.847
It's a restaurant today.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.791
Part of that building was a stable.

16:25.371 --> 16:35.325
And there were lots of small buildings at the lake here.

16:36.005 --> 16:40.992
And taught Swedish pupils to be good.

16:41.275 --> 16:47.287
I wonder if anybody could do that today.

16:47.387 --> 16:54.802
What do you call the architecture here?

16:55.684 --> 16:58.710
We think of the main...

16:59.028 --> 17:26.925
responsible architect is Caspar Fogel and he was an architect from Pomerania so he had been an assistant to Rangel in Pomerania where he also constructed some castles but also Nicodemus Tussin had made some drawings drawings

17:28.019 --> 17:29.281
And architecture.

17:29.301 --> 17:30.022
Baroque.

17:31.324 --> 17:31.744
Baroque.

17:34.107 --> 17:34.908
Do you agree, Lawrence?

17:35.229 --> 17:35.790
Baroque.

17:37.632 --> 17:38.013
Yes.

17:38.393 --> 17:39.495
Has to be.

17:39.515 --> 17:44.762
Without question.

17:45.123 --> 17:47.025
Quite decisively Baroque, I would say.

17:47.726 --> 17:51.812
And those initials up there over the crest must be for the family, right?

17:51.972 --> 17:52.413
Yes, yes.

17:52.433 --> 17:53.454
Family weapon.

17:53.474 --> 17:54.435
And that is that crest?

17:55.437 --> 17:56.338
Yes, yes it is.

17:57.112 --> 17:59.575
And I think it's a picture of that too.

18:01.056 --> 18:09.265
He told me that Vertumnus, the painting Vertumnus, will be taken up here for the television later on.

18:09.405 --> 18:15.291
And she will try to tell us, can we go down, so we can go down there and have a look at it.

18:15.311 --> 18:15.891
Not for materials.

18:15.911 --> 18:24.300
Before he started to build the cluster, he had planned the cluster for 20 years when they started to build here in 1654.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.330
So now we're on the third floor, on the second floor.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.034
Yes, now we are on the second floor.

18:33.054 --> 18:35.938
Unfinished hall.

18:43.128 --> 18:44.850
This is the hall we spoke about in the car.

18:45.011 --> 18:45.611
Oh, wow.

18:46.252 --> 18:48.876
Left from one day to another, more or less.

18:48.916 --> 18:50.398
Just explain a little bit for me.

18:50.939 --> 18:52.501
Nicholas, I've got to take some pictures of this.

18:53.242 --> 18:55.485
And how about if you just hold this tape recorder while I...

18:58.807 --> 19:11.112
This was a big magical, but he was out of money, and he had to talk to us from one day from another.

19:12.475 --> 19:14.377
Well, it's great for us that he did.

19:14.557 --> 19:18.180
There are many completed banquet halls, but how many incomplete ones?

19:18.601 --> 19:26.588
This is because of a rancid house in Pomeranian, in 1676.

19:27.689 --> 19:33.835
And it took about two weeks to give them snow here.

19:34.656 --> 19:41.082
And are these the... Are these the working tools that were in place?

19:42.125 --> 19:44.207
They were all kept here, up there.

19:44.868 --> 19:46.469
Not in this hall, but up there.

19:46.970 --> 19:52.356
And everything has been collected in this room now to show the tools in that time.

19:52.436 --> 19:53.397
That's perfect.

19:53.457 --> 19:54.758
So they just stopped?

19:54.778 --> 19:56.220
Yes, they just stopped.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.982
Probably because they weren't going to get paid, you think?

19:59.002 --> 20:00.104
Yes, yes, yes.

20:00.124 --> 20:06.630
They didn't know what was left, and if it was possible, it would get money if they went down here.

20:06.710 --> 20:08.392
Thank you indeed.

20:08.412 --> 20:09.313
That's it, yeah.

20:09.648 --> 20:13.491
And you know, from time to time, Codras Lavani didn't have so much money.

20:14.072 --> 20:25.983
So, on time, during the building of the car, it just worked because it didn't know if there were any money left to go and work on.

20:26.003 --> 20:29.846
This was how many years ago was this?

20:29.946 --> 20:33.309
This was 1676.

20:33.369 --> 20:39.655
So 1676, 321 years later, it's still, that's it, it's stuck.

20:43.195 --> 20:45.357
It would have been a very nice hole.

20:46.819 --> 20:55.248
Oh, yes.

20:56.449 --> 20:57.170
Oh, I think so.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.433
What do you think would have gone on top of the floor?

20:59.533 --> 21:00.734
Some sort of tiles?

21:02.316 --> 21:03.137
Yes, yes.

21:04.779 --> 21:06.821
They just quit in place.

21:08.382 --> 21:08.883
Amazing.

21:09.343 --> 21:09.844
Amazing.

21:10.516 --> 21:11.917
And you see the beam structure?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.819
This would have been covered, probably, you think?

21:13.839 --> 21:14.119
Yes.

21:16.241 --> 21:24.128
I'm sure you all took up that in the collection of Kogelsarvangen, the ceiling construction that was planned to be here.

21:24.148 --> 21:25.590
Oh, so they have... So we took it from the book?

21:25.610 --> 21:25.890
Yes.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.252
And the book is in the book.

21:28.753 --> 21:31.836
That's very... Isn't that spectacular?

21:32.016 --> 21:34.618
Sometimes the hall is used for a concept.

21:34.638 --> 21:37.000
Nice sound in here.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.101
So what do we call the hall?

21:38.702 --> 21:39.983
Unfinished Hall.

21:46.223 --> 21:47.885
Great, okay.

21:49.047 --> 21:54.835
It's from the Eastland, this is Italian.

21:55.175 --> 22:01.404
Your boys die, your friends die, you die, but the doom of the dead man doesn't die.

22:01.424 --> 22:01.844
It's interesting.

22:01.884 --> 22:03.567
What's in Italian here?

22:04.127 --> 22:04.608
Incredible.

22:05.509 --> 22:10.696
Definitely.

22:11.157 --> 22:14.982
Little nuggets of...

22:16.598 --> 22:17.663
What is the roof?

22:17.683 --> 22:18.426
Is that slate?

22:20.596 --> 22:21.058
Tiles.

22:24.031 --> 22:25.377
I wonder where they were made.

22:25.728 --> 22:26.750
Near here, do you think?

22:27.271 --> 22:37.529
They were made in Holland, but when Skotloster was restored, we could buy exactly the same in Poland, and that was much, much cheaper.

22:38.271 --> 22:41.296
But I'm amazed that after so many hundreds of years you could still get the same styles.

22:41.316 --> 22:49.491
Yes, and it was possible to get them from Holland, but it was too expensive for us, so therefore we bought them from Poland because they made the same.

22:49.471 --> 22:51.013
So there was a restoration here?

22:51.093 --> 22:55.339
Yes, there was a restoration from 1967 when the state bought this building.

22:56.541 --> 23:00.346
And then the restoration took about 10 years.

23:00.366 --> 23:01.127
I see.

23:01.808 --> 23:03.891
And when was it open for the public?

23:03.911 --> 23:12.002
It has been open all the time since 1967 and even before during the private time, but not as much as now.

23:12.573 --> 23:23.166
But as a tourist you could come here in the 1950s and it was open at least on the ground floor and on the first floor.

23:23.987 --> 23:29.875
So in the summertime you could come here by boat.

23:30.415 --> 23:32.858
Was this a militarily strong family?

23:33.639 --> 23:34.541
Did they have soldiers?

23:35.061 --> 23:37.244
We see them on horses and in armour and things.

23:37.684 --> 23:38.125
Yes.

23:38.240 --> 23:48.415
Were they, uh... Yes, Carlos Arranger and his father, they were soldiers, but all his sons died, so... So tell me where we are now.

23:49.035 --> 23:52.861
On the third floor, with armor and library.

23:53.221 --> 23:53.642
I see.

23:54.884 --> 23:56.066
And is that what that says there?

23:57.027 --> 24:02.074
That's Italian... Oh, so that doesn't identify the room.

24:02.094 --> 24:05.479
Can you... Yes.

24:05.830 --> 24:06.832
You go.

24:07.473 --> 24:09.056
I have a key.

24:10.619 --> 24:24.805
He, who, make you more caretze, more... Again, it's another one of those nuggets of... I have to figure it out.

24:24.825 --> 24:28.471
I understand it in Italian.

24:28.491 --> 24:29.914
Yes.

24:30.957 --> 24:36.023
The one who talks the sweetest is out to fool you.

24:36.944 --> 24:41.390
But caretse means... Yeah, you wish it to fool you.

24:41.410 --> 24:42.851
I like it, go to that way.

24:44.573 --> 24:48.038
They have the names of the European cities.

24:48.058 --> 24:49.159
I see, okay.

24:49.179 --> 24:53.464
So Stockholm, Roma, Amsterdam and so on.

24:54.505 --> 25:00.913
And before, it would come here in a small street.

25:01.332 --> 25:04.855
Yes, yes, the name of the room.

25:05.536 --> 25:12.242
And all the proverbs are written down in a book too, but I think, yes.

25:12.422 --> 25:13.924
Yes, yes, yes.

25:14.784 --> 25:19.649
That's what we probably think, these are proverbs in the world.

25:19.689 --> 25:22.051
Yes, yes.

25:22.351 --> 25:29.618
How many rooms in the castle?

25:30.408 --> 25:31.550
About 80.

25:31.810 --> 25:32.151
That's right.

25:32.171 --> 25:33.433
I would have thought many more.

25:35.917 --> 25:36.357
Wouldn't you?

25:36.378 --> 25:37.820
I would have thought two or three hundred.

25:38.681 --> 25:50.680
For example, one room that has been divided into two parts in the 18th century, so it has been changed a little at a later time.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.463
These are very spacious as well.

25:52.563 --> 25:53.365
That's right.

25:55.748 --> 25:57.411
Now we enter the library.

26:01.812 --> 26:10.262
Oh, look at this, huh?

26:16.949 --> 26:20.393
This is quite extraordinary.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.115
Elizabeth, is it Mr. Bassbanks?

26:22.135 --> 26:22.916
Bassbanks, yes.

26:23.097 --> 26:24.799
You visited the Nobel Library yesterday.

26:24.819 --> 26:25.980
Yesterday, yes.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.962
So you would have seen the shelves.

26:28.002 --> 26:29.524
That's right, yeah.

26:30.044 --> 26:31.926
with inspiration from Schokloster.

26:32.006 --> 26:33.387
Yes, that's exactly right.

26:33.407 --> 26:33.608
Yeah.

26:33.628 --> 26:34.689
In the 60s?

26:34.849 --> 26:35.309
Oh, yes.

26:35.329 --> 26:39.414
Yes, that's right.

26:39.454 --> 26:43.037
Tell me, tell me who, how you get to have so many books here.

26:44.018 --> 26:45.079
How did this happen?

26:45.880 --> 26:47.582
It started with Korgoster Rangen.

26:48.262 --> 26:52.126
And in 1665, he made the catalog.

26:53.268 --> 26:58.633
And about that time, those rooms were ready.

26:58.968 --> 27:05.076
So he started to put his books in the biggest rooms in this department.

27:05.096 --> 27:08.962
It's a room called Rome.

27:08.982 --> 27:14.369
And this collection was his lifetime less than 2,000 volumes.

27:14.389 --> 27:17.794
But when he died, he had about 2,400 volumes.

27:18.255 --> 27:19.636
Which is considerable for the time.

27:19.717 --> 27:20.818
Yes, yes it is.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.144
And now only...

27:26.018 --> 27:27.880
a part of that collection is kept here.

27:27.900 --> 27:34.908
Because when he died, his collection was divided into four parts for his daughter.

27:34.928 --> 27:40.255
And only the part that belonged to the daughter who inherited the castle is still kept here.

27:40.956 --> 27:41.837
That's a pity.

27:41.857 --> 27:51.027
But his daughter was married to Count Breuer, and Count Breuer took his books here from another castle, Rilberholm, that's north of Stockholm.

27:51.528 --> 27:54.051
And he also had a collection in Stockholm, and he took

27:54.402 --> 27:55.884
that collection here too.

27:56.465 --> 28:01.773
And then he inherited a collection from an island in the south of Sweden, Die StingsÃ¶l.

28:03.055 --> 28:13.069
That was the collection of his relative of... Uncle BrÃ¸y, yes.

28:13.971 --> 28:18.597
So at the beginning of the 18th century there were actually three family collections here.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.785
And in the middle of the 18th century

28:24.608 --> 28:33.536
A collection from a castle north of Uppsala that belonged to the Bjelke family came here.

28:33.576 --> 28:36.579
How were they coming here?

28:37.080 --> 28:38.841
Heritage.

28:38.941 --> 28:41.063
So this is really a lot of different libraries.

28:41.203 --> 28:42.865
Yes, there are five different libraries.

28:43.145 --> 28:44.867
That's in the material you gave me?

28:44.927 --> 28:47.970
Yes, yes it is.

28:47.990 --> 28:53.755
And the collection from Salsa, the collection coming here in the middle of the 18th century, that's the biggest collection.

28:54.393 --> 28:55.835
with 8,000 volumes.

28:55.855 --> 28:58.299
So you have a total of how many books approximately?

28:58.439 --> 29:13.180
Totally 20,000 volumes, but some of those volumes have got those small prints made for weddings and for funerals, or maybe only four or eight sides, and they are collected in volumes.

29:13.200 --> 29:21.152
So we could talk about 20,000 volumes and about 30,000 prints.

29:21.172 --> 29:21.312
Mm-hmm.

29:24.211 --> 29:29.757
And in terms of the library itself, what kinds of books are they?

29:29.777 --> 29:30.759
Are they important books?

29:30.859 --> 29:34.183
Are they of great interest as scholars, and why?

29:34.203 --> 29:37.186
What is here that you are unlikely to find someplace else?

29:37.206 --> 29:38.167
Oh, yes, yes.

29:38.247 --> 29:44.094
If I start with Carl Gustav Rangen, there are lots of books that he was supposed to have.

29:44.134 --> 29:47.959
That belonged to a man of his position.

29:48.820 --> 29:52.564
But there are also many books that we really know that he was interested of.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.943
to have, to read, to study.

29:54.964 --> 29:57.329
So he was an intellectual, you would say?

29:58.110 --> 29:58.611
In a way.

29:58.711 --> 30:02.940
I'm going to be very careful now.

30:03.522 --> 30:08.492
Because he was very interested in architecture and in science.

30:09.875 --> 30:13.523
And he bought new books on those items.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.118
All his life.

30:15.378 --> 30:19.082
And where did he buy his books, given that period when he lived?

30:19.122 --> 30:24.028
Yes, that was from about 1640, until he died.

30:24.488 --> 30:25.609
So where did he buy his books?

30:25.630 --> 30:26.350
Book agent.

30:26.370 --> 30:27.331
Who was his book agent?

30:27.351 --> 30:29.634
Yes, he had lots of book agents, you see.

30:29.654 --> 30:34.439
He had agents in Hamburg, in Frankfurt, in Amsterdam, and even in London.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.782
But he bought very few books from London.

30:37.062 --> 30:38.584
But he didn't write any books, no?

30:38.604 --> 30:40.866
No, no.

30:40.886 --> 30:42.568
Frankfurt, Amsterdam, where else?

30:42.588 --> 30:44.050
Amsterdam, Nynberg.

30:44.165 --> 30:46.287
Uh-huh.

30:46.308 --> 30:50.212
And so they're largely in, they're almost all mostly in Latin, the books?

30:50.272 --> 30:54.617
Yes, but actually Havre Favanger preferred books in modern languages.

30:55.198 --> 30:55.338
Uh-huh.

30:55.358 --> 31:01.245
So if it was possible to get a book in German or French, they prefer that to Latin.

31:01.265 --> 31:01.405
Uh-huh.

31:01.425 --> 31:12.578
And that's quite remarkable because Pagot, Pagot, because the account from his time and his language, he always bought books in Latin.

31:13.019 --> 31:13.159
Uh-huh.

31:13.662 --> 31:16.065
Did he buy books for content, or are there any rare books?

31:16.085 --> 31:18.267
Are there any incunables here, for instance?

31:18.527 --> 31:22.511
Yes, there are incunables, and most of them were taken as war booties.

31:23.412 --> 31:24.253
By whom?

31:24.273 --> 31:24.694
By Rangel.

31:25.635 --> 31:29.599
He took a war bootie in Germany, in Poland, and also in Denmark.

31:29.619 --> 31:30.780
And they're here, they're here.

31:31.060 --> 31:35.826
And they are here, yes, they are here.

31:35.846 --> 31:37.728
Will you show some together with the ink text?

31:37.948 --> 31:38.168
Sure, yeah.

31:38.553 --> 31:40.958
Like the Archibaldau paintings also?

31:41.118 --> 31:43.162
Oh, we're going to see the Archibaldau paintings?

31:43.222 --> 31:44.425
Yes, I think it will be arranged.

31:44.445 --> 31:45.026
Oh, that's great.

31:46.829 --> 31:51.218
My book has the Archibaldau painting on the back, on the dust jacket, the librarian.

31:52.360 --> 31:57.150
It would really be great.

31:57.591 --> 31:59.194
And Rangel has decided

31:59.950 --> 32:03.314
that the library should face east.

32:03.975 --> 32:12.967
Of course, we had learned that it was better to have books standing facing east.

32:12.987 --> 32:13.467
Was he right?

32:14.809 --> 32:16.371
I don't know.

32:16.832 --> 32:20.056
What do you think?

32:20.156 --> 32:21.377
It's wonderful here.

32:21.438 --> 32:28.827
It's sun in the morning, and when the sun is heating in the afternoon, it's not sun here, and I think that's good for the books.

32:29.465 --> 32:33.450
Was this a room for study, too, or mainly just for storage?

32:33.950 --> 32:38.896
No, only for storage, but there are odd desks, and there have been chairs all the time.

32:39.276 --> 32:42.600
We know that from the inventory that was made when he died.

32:43.641 --> 32:46.424
So he has been sitting here studying his books.

32:47.566 --> 32:51.130
Where we are right now, he ended up being here.

32:51.190 --> 32:54.974
Are any of these pieces of furniture contemporary?

32:54.994 --> 32:58.358
No, they are later, from the 18th century.

32:59.047 --> 32:59.628
Most of them.

32:59.688 --> 33:04.855
Here is an original chair, but the chair was not used for... Yes, original floor.

33:05.776 --> 33:10.262
But this chair was not used for studying.

33:11.023 --> 33:18.413
It's a chair for, we think, one of our kings who was quite easy as he was old.

33:19.575 --> 33:27.045
And he could sit in his chair, and he could lie in his chair, and he could use this as a table or as a desk.

33:27.093 --> 33:49.725
Maybe the king never left the chair when he was sitting here.

33:50.482 --> 33:56.471
Which king was it did you say?

33:57.773 --> 33:58.975
But why would it be up here?

33:59.255 --> 34:10.532
Because this Count Brahe had a married

34:11.407 --> 34:14.691
Oh, no, that's too much detail, I think.

34:15.171 --> 34:24.302
But, but, you can't... By inheritance?

34:26.104 --> 34:28.647
Yeah, yes.

34:31.491 --> 34:32.392
Charles 10?

34:32.472 --> 34:36.056
No, no, they only brought his chair here.

34:36.076 --> 34:36.657
He wasn't here?

34:36.697 --> 34:38.459
No, no, not at all.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.602
He used it when he was in Gothenburg.

34:40.822 --> 34:41.042
Okay.

34:41.782 --> 34:46.126
You really wouldn't call it a clone.

34:46.306 --> 34:52.411
But I think it's quite exclusive.

34:52.511 --> 34:55.374
And this was a velvet.

34:55.394 --> 35:00.298
But it is all destroyed with the clothes because of the sun.

35:00.518 --> 35:03.020
And that is a butthole, that particulature?

35:03.080 --> 35:04.181
That's from 1660.

35:04.201 --> 35:04.942
Wow.

35:05.082 --> 35:11.788
Oh, that's Colombia in Germany.

35:12.764 --> 35:18.970
And it was placed outside the door here because this room has got the main column.

35:21.013 --> 35:23.775
So... Now that you should almost preserve.

35:24.056 --> 35:27.339
I mean, that's gonna... Yes, but it's quite difficult.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.420
It's probably going past the point.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.502
All of them are in very, very bad condition.

35:30.623 --> 35:33.245
And we think that something was made wrong at the beginning.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.907
I see.

35:34.927 --> 35:37.149
When the putters put them up on canvas.

35:37.770 --> 35:39.332
The glue or something like that.

35:39.372 --> 35:41.033
Yes, wrong materials in some way.

35:41.154 --> 35:41.694
Just a clear loop.

35:41.714 --> 35:42.535
Yes.

35:43.510 --> 35:43.991
Too bad.

35:45.012 --> 35:48.758
I'd hate it.

35:48.778 --> 35:50.440
Is it to do with the learning method?

35:50.460 --> 35:51.101
No, no.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.603
It has nothing to do with it.

35:52.623 --> 35:54.786
Well, why Pythagoras up there, for instance?

35:55.007 --> 35:58.432
Wasn't he a sculptor, as a matter of fact?

35:58.732 --> 35:59.453
Pythagoras?

35:59.773 --> 36:00.074
No.

36:00.214 --> 36:01.496
No, he was Pythagoras.

36:02.017 --> 36:03.218
Traxidilis, I'm thinking of.

36:03.238 --> 36:04.320
Yes, he was.

36:04.891 --> 36:17.466
You know, the mathematics, that's right, yeah.

36:17.646 --> 36:25.315
But the walls and the ceiling, they were repainted about 1820.

36:25.335 --> 36:33.565
Then there was the first restoration here in all the castles and many rooms changed.

36:34.321 --> 36:40.090
I was just going to say that they are an excellent piece.

36:40.110 --> 36:41.512
Is that 1820, I think is what you said?

36:41.772 --> 36:43.235
Yes, 1820, yes.

36:43.595 --> 36:48.022
But were they, you know... It was about the same decoration before.

36:48.102 --> 36:52.148
We can have a look at it in another room where they didn't paint all the walls.

36:53.791 --> 36:57.156
And the book shelves from about the same time.

36:57.507 --> 37:01.550
But they were not painted until 20 years later, about 1840.

37:02.932 --> 37:11.799
So on some of the... You can see small... Let's go.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.841
Little pinkles.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.142
Patches of the colour?

37:15.282 --> 37:15.582
Yes.

37:15.843 --> 37:19.586
So when they painted, they didn't take a look at it?

37:19.606 --> 37:23.429
No, they didn't take a look at it, yes.

37:23.489 --> 37:26.412
That's when you look at the vellum.

37:26.432 --> 37:26.772
Incredible.

37:31.443 --> 37:32.044
That's funny.

37:33.567 --> 37:39.819
And all the numbers you see here, they can be found in old book catalogs.

37:39.839 --> 37:41.643
And so what was the catalog scheme?

37:41.683 --> 37:45.590
By a session or did they have any kind of a scheme or subject?

37:45.610 --> 37:49.738
Yes, yes, because Rangel, he had divided his library into it.

37:49.718 --> 37:53.824
different sections depending on what subject it is.

37:53.964 --> 38:05.682
So there are books on theology and on history and on philosophy, but he has also got lots of books in Roman languages, in Italian and Spanish and French, and they are kept together.

38:06.162 --> 38:11.250
It doesn't matter what subject they are written on, but they are kept together.

38:13.734 --> 38:16.257
So if they're ever misplaced, it's going to be impossible to find them.

38:17.419 --> 38:19.422
No, but you have this...

38:19.705 --> 38:24.652
The order of the books has been restored, so for some time it was destroyed.

38:24.933 --> 38:32.784
But that's what you've been doing to a large part, trying to figure out whose library did this book belong to at first.

38:33.385 --> 38:39.835
So today they're all placed by owner, but in the 1820s that was all mixed up.

38:40.696 --> 38:44.582
So that's also an important part of your catalogue you're doing now, is to trace it.

38:44.663 --> 38:45.324
Where did it come from?

38:45.344 --> 38:46.465
That's what you're doing.

38:46.505 --> 38:49.269
You're trying to determine... I think you should tell us that.

38:49.769 --> 38:54.856
We started... I wasn't here in 1967, but this work started in 1967.

38:56.318 --> 39:00.563
And all the libraries were mixed at that time.

39:00.984 --> 39:06.010
But the catalogs were kept from the time when the books were bought.

39:06.551 --> 39:12.358
So it was not easy, but it was possible to reconstruct.

39:13.958 --> 39:18.945
The provenance basically.

39:19.005 --> 39:24.834
You've been able to see, for example, this label is typical of him and this kind of signature is typical of him.

39:24.954 --> 39:30.082
So that's how you've been learning about it.

39:31.123 --> 39:32.666
Where does the idea come from?

39:32.726 --> 39:35.590
Do you have any library that's done the same thing?

39:35.810 --> 39:42.480
No, but I think that Dr. Limberg from Kobe, who was responsible for the library at that time,

39:42.983 --> 39:46.507
he thought it was the only right when to do.

39:46.908 --> 39:48.009
Was he a librarian?

39:48.369 --> 39:49.631
Yes, he was a librarian.

39:49.871 --> 39:51.313
A rare book librarian.

39:51.333 --> 39:51.954
Yes, yes.

39:51.974 --> 39:53.656
The Royal Library, where you were yesterday.

39:54.136 --> 39:54.897
And he's still living.

39:55.298 --> 39:57.280
Yes, and he's still working there.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.643
He was here with Carola, for example.

39:59.663 --> 40:00.904
Carola told you about this.

40:00.944 --> 40:03.948
He was here with us.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.930
How about the original owners?

40:05.970 --> 40:08.333
Did they have anybody who functioned as a librarian?

40:08.482 --> 40:10.084
No, no, they didn't.

40:10.104 --> 40:11.907
I think Carl Gustav Ragnar was quite mean.

40:12.568 --> 40:20.760
So when he had got a quite big collection, somebody was asked to make a catalogue, but it was a very, very simple catalogue.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.601
Inventory?

40:21.681 --> 40:24.445
Yes, yes, more of an inventory.

40:25.186 --> 40:29.012
A short title where the book was printed and what year, but nothing else.

40:29.573 --> 40:36.042
The size was... So really, the books were placed here, and there really was nobody...

40:36.798 --> 40:39.001
No, no, no, not at all.

40:39.962 --> 40:40.603
That's important.

40:40.843 --> 40:41.164
Yes.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.368
It's amazing they survived intact.

40:44.568 --> 40:52.820
Yes, but I think that from time to time, during the last century, people have not been so very interested in this library.

40:52.900 --> 40:58.908
So it has been preserved here, and nobody has been interested in it.

40:59.348 --> 41:02.673
In our time, interest is growing.

41:02.693 --> 41:04.756
Thank you very much.

41:04.776 --> 41:05.877
Yes, yes.

41:06.177 --> 41:07.258
That's amazing.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.665
What would you say is the great significance, in your view, of this library?

41:13.987 --> 41:18.373
What is the significance, other than the historical significance?

41:18.393 --> 41:23.620
Is there a significance in terms of the book itself?

41:23.680 --> 41:27.685
What would a scholar find of particular interest here in these books?

41:27.805 --> 41:29.347
Do you get scholars who... Oh, yes.

41:29.367 --> 41:30.008
Oh, yes, you get them.

41:30.595 --> 41:40.690
If I take an example, a young lady from Germany, she has studied books coming from Germany.

41:41.451 --> 41:49.583
And she has been looking at all the books here to find German names, special German names, because she came from Mainz.

41:51.014 --> 42:02.349
And she know that folks were taken from certain places around mines to Sweden at the time of the Thirty Years' War.

42:03.331 --> 42:05.153
And she tried to find them in Sweden.

42:06.615 --> 42:14.005
And she also studied the bindings because... Yes, the decoration and family weapons.

42:14.686 --> 42:16.628
And she take all those pieces together.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.591
This is a great example of...

42:19.060 --> 42:20.802
believe it or not, the history of the book.

42:21.023 --> 42:21.824
Yes, yes.

42:21.844 --> 42:23.246
Not the content.

42:23.266 --> 42:33.960
What you can determine about a society by the making of the book, the binding of the book, the selling of the book, the migration of the book, the, you know... The life of the book.

42:33.980 --> 42:37.044
The life of the book will tell you so much about the history.

42:37.124 --> 42:45.015
It's the reconstructing... That's exactly what this... Yeah, exactly, yeah.

42:45.035 --> 42:46.857
Absolutely, that's precisely that.

42:47.292 --> 42:53.919
That's the kind of research going on in the Financier Library today.

42:54.019 --> 42:57.944
There are other libraries where you can trade the order.

42:57.964 --> 42:59.866
It's still on fine in Holland, for example.

42:59.886 --> 43:02.889
You can find the letters in order.

43:03.029 --> 43:09.496
But now this young gentleman, this German lady who's doing this research, she's specifically tracking German war booty.

43:10.497 --> 43:10.898
War booty.

43:11.879 --> 43:12.680
We're talking about war.

43:12.740 --> 43:15.543
We have to be very clear which wars we're talking about.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.624
Yes, that's right.

43:17.178 --> 43:24.430
and also the wars, there were two wars between Sweden and Denmark in the 17th century, and Carl Gustav Rangel took part in both of them.

43:24.811 --> 43:30.600
Which books do you think, obviously you're going to see by the books that he took, which books were important to him?

43:30.620 --> 43:31.842
He must have left some behind.

43:31.963 --> 43:32.323
Yes.

43:32.443 --> 43:35.488
Which books would, why would he take certain ones and leave others?

43:36.049 --> 43:36.270
Yes.

43:36.971 --> 43:38.253
What was his sense of value?

43:38.273 --> 43:43.101
Yes, we know that then he used...

43:43.317 --> 43:48.866
He fellow of more education to help him to take the right books.

43:48.946 --> 43:49.828
He got advice.

43:50.028 --> 43:51.410
He didn't do it on every occasion.

43:51.430 --> 43:52.171
He got advice.

43:52.191 --> 43:54.876
Sometimes he got advice, yes.

43:54.896 --> 44:00.505
Somebody might say, you know, this is... And of course, I had certain interests, for example, architecture.

44:00.685 --> 44:01.887
His personal interests, yes.

44:01.907 --> 44:03.470
All the books of architecture that he could take.

44:04.591 --> 44:06.895
And what kinds of places would they plunder?

44:08.377 --> 44:14.504
It causes official buildings in towns.

44:14.825 --> 44:15.365
Monasteries.

44:15.726 --> 44:19.751
Monasteries, for example, many monasteries.

44:19.771 --> 44:24.617
Quite a few Jesuit monasteries and libraries are in Sweden today, in Uppsala, for example.

44:24.817 --> 44:26.119
Many parts in Uppsala.

44:26.139 --> 44:29.843
This book by Valde, has that been translated?

44:30.163 --> 44:31.465
No, no, no.

44:31.732 --> 44:35.219
And it should have been translated to German.

44:35.519 --> 44:37.823
Yes, they would find it useful.

44:37.904 --> 44:39.627
Which book are we talking about?

44:39.647 --> 44:42.993
Otto Walde has written a great work about war booting in Sweden.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.195
Exactly where they went.

44:44.235 --> 44:46.660
That's not available in English, of course.

44:46.740 --> 44:49.926
No, and there is one copy in a public library in German.

44:50.159 --> 44:52.803
Which is amazing, because that's a very important book.

44:53.324 --> 44:59.152
So therefore, Nadine Fogler, that's the name of the scholar working here, she had to learn Swedish.

44:59.453 --> 45:05.381
And it started with that he knew that Valde, I had to read Valde.

45:05.662 --> 45:10.689
And then she said, I had to learn Swedish, otherwise I can't read Valde.

45:10.929 --> 45:12.712
So we hope she'll translate it.

45:12.732 --> 45:13.814
That's good, that'd be great.

45:14.855 --> 45:15.556
Okay, what else?

45:15.837 --> 45:16.858
You gonna show us some other books?

45:23.723 --> 45:32.092
This is almost like deja vu in Twitter, isn't it?

45:32.113 --> 45:32.713
Come on now.

45:33.334 --> 45:34.976
Let's start.

45:34.996 --> 45:49.292
You can do it.

45:49.643 --> 45:55.010
Can I just take a picture of you there with your books?

45:55.030 --> 45:55.971
Yes.

45:56.532 --> 45:58.214
If you could just stand in a little bit.

46:00.937 --> 46:04.101
Actually, you could bring one out here.

46:05.824 --> 46:14.034
Because this is the book with the ceiling, the unfinished wall.

46:14.495 --> 46:14.875
Yes.

46:19.276 --> 46:43.140
german yes yes yes i think this is very good i like i like with your hands you can just talk yes i'll go back to that picture yes okay um i think this is one of the best

46:43.930 --> 46:45.091
And that book is what?

46:45.272 --> 46:50.277
What is that book that you just took out?

46:50.297 --> 46:56.044
So it's an architectural book that has the original design for that unfinished building that we saw downstairs.

46:56.064 --> 46:56.544
That's right.

46:56.985 --> 46:58.687
And this book dates from about when?

46:59.447 --> 47:01.850
From 1649.

47:01.890 --> 47:05.034
And this is the construction.

47:07.136 --> 47:09.699
I just got a picture of that.

47:09.719 --> 47:12.402
And we know that Carl Gustav Reinheld bought

47:12.702 --> 47:14.624
Three editions of this book.

47:16.686 --> 47:21.652
He wanted to check if there was something new in the next edition and the next book again.

47:21.732 --> 47:31.102
Is it possible to say in percentage how much of this is acquired books, buying an inheritance, and how much of it is stolen from war booty?

47:31.202 --> 47:31.802
Is there not so much?

47:31.822 --> 47:35.747
Yes, heritage only very, very few from his father, Hermann.

47:36.467 --> 47:39.651
And about 10% war booty.

47:40.372 --> 47:42.574
The rest was bought.

47:43.027 --> 47:48.616
Did he pay a lot of money, considering the books, whatever books were included?

47:48.636 --> 47:51.360
Is it included in the inventory, what he has paid for?

47:51.420 --> 47:56.228
Yes, sometimes, but not always.

47:56.248 --> 48:03.499
Because he wrote letters to those agents around in Europe, and sometimes the price is sold, but not always.

48:07.883 --> 48:11.028
And this is the number from the catalogue, 1665.

48:11.048 --> 48:12.110
1665, number 20.

48:12.130 --> 48:13.232
1665, yes.

48:13.893 --> 48:16.777
That's the best catalogue made in the lifetime of Fr.

48:16.817 --> 48:17.699
Stavanger.

48:18.781 --> 48:19.361
Okay.

48:25.572 --> 48:26.493
And who did the binding?

48:27.575 --> 48:30.339
Did they send them out of the country?

48:30.359 --> 48:32.102
We know very, very little about it.

48:33.567 --> 48:39.513
Sometimes in Pomerania, because he bought books to Pomerania and took them to Skokloster.

48:41.254 --> 48:42.736
So we really don't know the country?

48:42.796 --> 48:43.196
No, no.

48:43.216 --> 48:44.658
We know very, very little about it.

48:45.699 --> 48:51.344
We know only what was mentioned in letters from Rangel to his agent.

48:51.724 --> 48:53.586
But they were mainly bought down?

48:53.806 --> 48:54.907
Yes, definitely.

48:54.927 --> 48:56.169
So they were never locally bound?

48:56.229 --> 48:56.489
No.

48:56.829 --> 48:58.371
So they were bound where he bought?

48:58.711 --> 49:00.773
Very often in those days you bought the unfinished

49:01.023 --> 49:03.927
Yeah, the unbound books, and then you had them bound yourself.

49:03.987 --> 49:04.307
Yeah.

49:05.229 --> 49:07.051
So he probably just instructed them to bind them.

49:07.211 --> 49:08.473
And most of them are very simple.

49:09.354 --> 49:11.577
Yes, there's nothing elaborate about them at all.

49:11.597 --> 49:13.259
In fact, there is a sameness to most of them.

49:13.399 --> 49:14.421
Yeah.

49:14.461 --> 49:15.943
Not very remarkable bindings.

49:15.963 --> 49:18.646
But they've lasted 300 years ago.

49:18.686 --> 49:19.007
Yeah.

49:20.188 --> 49:20.809
Undestructible.

49:20.849 --> 49:21.370
That's right.

49:21.390 --> 49:22.671
Well, what would the best know here?

49:24.874 --> 49:25.495
It's going to be uncomfortable.

49:28.462 --> 49:29.023
Thank you, Max.

49:29.043 --> 49:30.685
We have also got the second edition.

49:31.586 --> 49:33.789
So three copies of Carolina and two here.

49:34.290 --> 49:34.370
Wow.

49:35.952 --> 49:36.934
Want to help her, fellas?

49:36.974 --> 49:38.496
That's a great book.

49:38.556 --> 49:39.857
Oh, no.

49:40.959 --> 49:43.262
Good.

49:43.282 --> 49:43.883
All right.

49:43.963 --> 49:46.166
This is the second.

49:46.186 --> 49:47.828
Tell us what you have here, please.

49:47.908 --> 49:54.958
Yes, it's Basilius Bessler, Hortus Eichstetensis, 1640.

49:56.288 --> 49:58.190
from EichstÃ¤tt in Germany.

49:58.270 --> 50:03.415
Tell me, I know the book, but you could just tell me what's wonderful about it.

50:03.695 --> 50:12.904
All the wonderful flowers in the garden collected here in copper plates.

50:13.325 --> 50:23.815
I think this is one on the first.

50:24.605 --> 50:31.652
the first early states.

50:31.672 --> 50:34.255
Well, not proof prints, but they would have been very early.

50:35.977 --> 50:39.440
But it's a pity sometimes it's not very, very nice.

50:39.460 --> 50:46.067
It's destroyed in some way.

50:46.087 --> 50:47.008
And it hangs a fly line.

50:47.048 --> 50:49.971
There are very few fly lines.

50:50.879 --> 50:54.123
That's Nicola Barthes, he was here the other year.

50:54.243 --> 50:55.465
Barthes, can I say this?

50:55.485 --> 50:56.406
Yes, oh yes.

50:56.746 --> 50:59.670
He's made an inventory of this fantasy or something.

50:59.690 --> 51:00.351
He's in my book.

51:00.911 --> 51:01.112
Wow.

51:01.492 --> 51:06.038
I've interviewed him two, three times.

51:06.058 --> 51:06.859
And look at this.

51:06.879 --> 51:09.462
And he found another book on flowers here, a manuscript.

51:09.882 --> 51:12.385
So she hadn't... No, she hadn't seen it.

51:12.426 --> 51:13.647
We had never heard of it either.

51:14.487 --> 51:16.612
So I think that... He found a book?

51:16.652 --> 51:18.075
Nicholas found a book?

51:18.095 --> 51:18.556
Yes, yes.

51:18.596 --> 51:19.358
That he didn't know about?

51:19.919 --> 51:23.407
No, he didn't know about it because I think nothing has been written about it.

51:23.427 --> 51:23.909
What was the book?

51:24.029 --> 51:29.141
That is a war booty, a small book from a manuscript from, probably from a nunnery.

51:29.161 --> 51:30.925
I can show it to you.

51:31.265 --> 51:32.548
That would be great.

51:32.669 --> 51:33.711
Yes, it's wonderful.

51:34.130 --> 51:40.018
If Nicholas found something that he didn't know of, then that's a pretty significant find.

51:40.038 --> 51:41.399
He was quite tired when he came.

51:41.479 --> 51:44.744
He came from the airplane and he had no lunch.

51:44.764 --> 51:46.226
He didn't know that.

51:46.726 --> 51:50.731
But when he saw this book, he was so exciting.

51:51.673 --> 51:54.817
I might give Nicholas a call for a comment, actually.

51:59.262 --> 52:02.787
How many volumes is that?

52:03.914 --> 52:04.875
Is that a one volume?

52:04.896 --> 52:06.017
Yes, there's only one.

52:06.037 --> 52:07.019
But you have two copies?

52:07.079 --> 52:07.920
Yes, two copies.

52:07.940 --> 52:09.022
Well, I've got the first copy too.

52:09.863 --> 52:12.828
The first edition, sorry.

52:12.848 --> 52:14.610
And you had a third which was stolen from you?

52:15.011 --> 52:16.133
No, no, no.

52:18.637 --> 52:26.749
But I think it's not easy to understand how they could take it out from the library because it's so heavy and so huge.

52:27.421 --> 52:30.224
Why doesn't someone ask him, what are you doing?

52:30.284 --> 52:31.305
Is that your own book?

52:31.325 --> 52:31.986
Unbelievable.

52:32.006 --> 52:32.927
You mean somebody took it?

52:33.207 --> 52:36.731
Yes, took it under his arms and went out from the library.

52:36.851 --> 52:38.573
How long ago was this?

52:39.194 --> 52:39.855
Two weeks ago.

52:39.955 --> 52:42.938
Oh, that's the one that we discussed in the car.

52:43.579 --> 52:45.922
So he found an atlas of the same size and colour.

52:46.362 --> 52:48.625
And he managed to exchange them.

52:49.466 --> 52:52.709
So he told the librarian in the special reading room, I'm just returning the atlas.

52:52.749 --> 52:53.530
And she said, okay.

52:53.898 --> 52:58.065
because an accomplice of his was asking her stupid questions, so she was very busy.

52:58.105 --> 53:00.629
Distracted it.

53:00.709 --> 53:01.110
Yes.

53:01.350 --> 53:07.420
So it's unfortunately still... You know, these things happen... Go ahead, I'm sorry.

53:08.402 --> 53:14.151
Yes, this is a family Bible called Mr. Rangel, and Mr. Mokul, of course, he has written in it, because...

53:14.857 --> 53:18.543
He has never written in the books, except in the Family Bible.

53:19.124 --> 53:28.619
And I think that's quite annoying sometimes, because we know that he really wanted to buy a book, and he had written what he had read in the book, and sometimes he was angry.

53:28.819 --> 53:37.152
For example, when I was told in a book that he hadn't behaved as he wanted to behave, that was in the war.

53:37.435 --> 53:43.781
And then I, yes, I had wanted him to make notes, react in some way, but he didn't.

53:43.801 --> 53:46.703
He only reacted in letters.

53:46.724 --> 53:51.668
That's so good, because people say, oh, you should leave books spotless, you know, book culture again.

53:51.688 --> 53:52.249
Book culture.

53:52.269 --> 53:57.073
I'm having a chapter on readers and the annotations in their books, which you can tell.

53:57.714 --> 54:01.177
So what she's saying is, why didn't he write in the book?

54:01.197 --> 54:02.658
And here is a Bible in which he did.

54:03.079 --> 54:06.902
You see, in this collection, we have also got

54:07.135 --> 54:21.602
We have also got some small collections from clerks and peasants, peasants of quite good... Property owners?

54:21.882 --> 54:22.804
Yes, property owners.

54:23.225 --> 54:23.766
Landowners?

54:23.866 --> 54:29.717
Yes, but not very wealthy peasants, but they have small collections of books, maybe 20 books.

54:30.187 --> 54:37.600
And they had really used their books for making commentaries and notes.

54:37.941 --> 54:42.829
You can really see that they have read their books.

54:42.849 --> 54:45.674
Even books that have belonged to priests.

54:45.695 --> 54:47.918
I just wrote what's going to be in that story.

54:47.939 --> 54:50.623
When you have it, you don't want to lose it.

54:50.643 --> 54:53.308
Here we are without any lights, without any heat.

54:53.575 --> 54:56.399
on a murky day looking at ancient books.

54:56.419 --> 55:00.064
So this is a bibliographical experience, isn't it?

55:03.368 --> 55:04.469
So tell us again.

55:04.509 --> 55:06.852
These are his annotations.

55:07.113 --> 55:07.553
Yes.

55:07.593 --> 55:08.655
This is whose annotations?

55:08.695 --> 55:10.177
Tell me what annotations are.

55:10.197 --> 55:11.238
You don't have to step away.

55:11.298 --> 55:12.200
I like you in the picture.

55:13.481 --> 55:14.943
Think about the lights.

55:15.043 --> 55:16.085
Perhaps it's your future.

55:16.645 --> 55:21.692
Kolbester Rangel's family Bible with annotations about...

55:21.942 --> 55:30.433
the children, the children that were born, also when they died of course, because most of the children died when they were quite young.

55:31.714 --> 55:36.280
And it ends with the death of his wife.

55:39.744 --> 55:40.425
Is he eloquent?

55:41.967 --> 55:42.067
No.

55:43.209 --> 55:48.355
No.

55:48.807 --> 55:58.041
There aren't any wrangles around anymore.

55:58.061 --> 55:59.062
So what do you learn about him?

55:59.523 --> 56:00.625
Do you learn things about him?

56:01.466 --> 56:03.108
No, not much.

56:03.349 --> 56:05.732
And when was that Bible printed and where do you know?

56:05.812 --> 56:09.818
It was printed 1642 in Lineburg.

56:10.580 --> 56:10.880
Where?

56:11.401 --> 56:12.182
Lineburg.

56:12.348 --> 56:19.756
His wife was born in the neighborhood of LÃ¼neburg.

56:19.776 --> 56:23.440
It's only his name that has the name of Drangens.

56:23.660 --> 56:25.582
Yes, there are many.

56:25.742 --> 56:27.845
There are lots of Drangens.

56:27.925 --> 56:31.949
And that's the original binding with clasps, I would think, right?

56:31.989 --> 56:32.770
Yes, oh yes it is.

56:33.010 --> 56:34.272
And what is the binding?

56:34.352 --> 56:35.293
Black velvet.

56:36.754 --> 56:40.959
But in a quite bad condition.

56:40.979 --> 56:42.220
That's why it's kept in.

56:42.875 --> 56:44.237
This little box.

56:44.257 --> 56:45.879
It's been used.

56:45.899 --> 56:47.281
Yes, it's been used.

56:47.301 --> 56:50.225
So would you say they were a particularly religious family?

56:50.265 --> 56:52.368
No, no, no.

56:52.388 --> 56:54.110
But the Bible, nevertheless, is the Bible.

56:54.210 --> 56:58.116
Yes, yes, he had lots of Bibles because he was supposed to have them.

56:58.156 --> 57:04.865
I think it's quite common for people to use the family Bibles for limitations of the family, because it was inherited and kept to it very much.

57:04.885 --> 57:05.325
That's right.

57:05.345 --> 57:09.531
I think people have done it in all centuries.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.093
Yes, continue to do it.

57:11.697 --> 57:16.984
They will often give us a few shy leaves at the end before that process.

57:17.004 --> 57:17.304
Yes, yes.

57:18.445 --> 57:20.348
Yes, they have added several.

57:20.368 --> 57:21.990
Extra leaves, yes.

57:22.110 --> 57:27.196
And how many rooms does the library have?

57:27.236 --> 57:28.658
Seven rooms.

57:28.678 --> 57:28.958
Seven?

57:29.038 --> 57:30.000
Seven rooms, totally.

57:30.280 --> 57:30.600
Seven?

57:30.761 --> 57:32.743
Yes, seven rooms.

57:33.382 --> 57:48.065
Since the 1820s, because at the time we called the Stavranes one room and then after some years there were two rooms and three rooms and so on.

57:48.085 --> 57:48.585
Great.

57:48.605 --> 57:52.511
So this basically is almost a whole side of a floor, isn't it?

57:52.812 --> 57:52.892
Yes.

57:56.500 --> 58:03.907
Some of them are from the time of Agnes, some of them are later.

58:04.047 --> 58:12.554
This is beautiful, isn't it?

58:14.996 --> 58:19.020
This is the collection of HjÃ¤lke.

58:20.221 --> 58:25.866
And he died in 1764.

58:26.453 --> 58:33.823
and he had got a French education and he had been diplomat in France too.

58:35.265 --> 58:39.530
So it's a connection with French influence really.

58:40.432 --> 58:48.462
But he also bought books in Sweden, book actions in South London and even in small towns in Sweden.

58:48.482 --> 58:52.748
Those pictures on the side of the cases, do they identify the owners of these people?

58:55.107 --> 58:56.529
They are contemporary to what?

58:56.549 --> 59:02.018
Yes, they are contemporary to all the studies, yes.

59:02.038 --> 59:03.540
But some of them are not older.

59:03.981 --> 59:05.062
That's right.

59:05.162 --> 59:08.287
It may not come out, but it's too English.

59:08.387 --> 59:13.756
I got a lighting camera.

59:13.776 --> 59:18.182
I'm going to get a mic if I were waiting.

59:18.923 --> 59:22.549
I've got these big Nikons and a Hasselblad.

59:22.934 --> 59:24.256
but they're too heavy to carry.

59:24.516 --> 59:27.480
You know, I'm doing four countries, and so this is my daughter's camera.

59:28.441 --> 59:29.322
It's a Nikko.

59:29.342 --> 59:31.244
I said, at least it's a light.

59:31.264 --> 59:37.091
I'm sorry, I didn't have my tape on it.

59:37.111 --> 59:41.317
These globes are brought and brought by, in the time of whom, Carlos?

59:41.337 --> 59:42.979
That was called Yucatanian.

59:42.999 --> 59:43.379
Okay.

59:44.280 --> 59:47.104
And 1662 they were made, and that's about when they were purchased?

59:47.124 --> 59:48.526
So they were purchased new from Holland?

59:49.607 --> 59:50.168
Probably.

59:50.188 --> 59:50.528
Yes.

59:50.626 --> 59:54.171
And this chart here, this, oh, that's a map of France in the background.

59:54.251 --> 59:54.432
Okay.

59:57.697 --> 59:59.740
There's lots of maps from Holland.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.622
Mm-hmm.

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:06.530
And how long does that map do, you know?

01:00:09.975 --> 01:00:10.896
I'm not quite sure.

01:00:10.916 --> 01:00:13.480
That's okay.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.785
I just thought you might know, that's all I think, which will be right here.

01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:18.626
That's fine, but it's very old.

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:20.109
There's no question about that.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:30.910
I wonder who that is.
