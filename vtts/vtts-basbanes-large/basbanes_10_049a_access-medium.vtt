WEBVTT

00:04.722 --> 00:19.124
And there are 10,000 square meters each.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.427
30,000 is just the sacks.

00:22.409 --> 00:24.953
And now this is totally empty.

00:24.973 --> 00:28.418
It will be from 2010 to 2030.

00:29.056 --> 00:30.758
Now you say this is totally empty.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.920
This is what level is this?

00:32.220 --> 00:33.121
This is third level.

00:33.181 --> 00:33.662
Third level.

00:33.682 --> 00:35.564
So the third level is totally empty.

00:35.845 --> 00:38.268
And these are about half.

00:38.288 --> 00:44.956
And so up to... So if... Third level is empty.

00:45.016 --> 00:45.557
Empty.

00:45.577 --> 00:49.121
And here is a small room for cars, motor cars.

00:49.282 --> 00:49.742
That's 210.

00:49.762 --> 00:50.083
201.

00:50.103 --> 00:50.783
210.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.464
210.

00:51.484 --> 00:51.945
Sorry.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.328
Watch it.

00:54.348 --> 00:56.651
22040.

00:57.051 --> 00:57.612
And then...

00:57.862 --> 01:13.924
On the other side of the street, there is an empty room, and for the, from 30 to 3000, we will get, and this is another empty spot, and we will get it.

01:14.305 --> 01:16.648
To the year 3000, or to the year what?

01:17.029 --> 01:19.172
Sorry, sorry, 2-1-0-0.

01:20.934 --> 01:21.175
Wow.

01:24.039 --> 01:26.502
Nobody knows, but...

01:27.528 --> 01:29.110
I thought I really had a story here.

01:30.492 --> 01:31.674
So this is Reserv.

01:33.356 --> 01:35.859
But you have made provisions for the next hundred years.

01:36.060 --> 01:36.881
Yes, yes.

01:37.101 --> 01:45.352
And you will see in Leipzig, when they built Leipzig in 1912, they had provisions up to, nearly up to the year 2000.

01:45.373 --> 01:51.561
They had room enough because they didn't want to have outstations.

01:51.980 --> 02:01.115
and to go print books far away, and therefore, of course, nobody knows what will be in 20 years.

02:01.756 --> 02:13.215
Normally we say maybe that 10%, or perhaps more, will be electronic material.

02:13.856 --> 02:17.262
But the number of books is still increasing.

02:18.203 --> 02:22.208
Each year we get about 3% more than the year before.

02:23.029 --> 02:28.456
The number of books and journals is still increasing.

02:28.536 --> 02:30.238
How many titles a year would you say?

02:30.818 --> 02:37.887
You get 550,000 titles per year.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.530
250 or 5,000?

02:40.550 --> 02:42.353
250.

02:42.833 --> 02:45.156
In Frankfurt and in other 250

02:45.423 --> 03:11.751
in Leipzig, but of course you should count them not twice, so it is, we got in Frankfurt, the total input is 250,000, in some exceptions you may say even 300,000, but the question is, for example, we collect letters of German immigrants, because we have a small collection

03:11.950 --> 03:22.384
Deutsche Exil Literature from authors which were obliged to escape during the Nazi time and if you count those much in the years.

03:22.404 --> 03:25.168
Now these are what kind of these are manuscripts?

03:25.228 --> 03:27.431
They are manuscripts.

03:27.451 --> 03:32.539
But it's only from even an author, Thomas Mann or anyone.

03:33.159 --> 03:34.682
So we have a special collection.

03:34.702 --> 03:40.810
If you count everything together you count up to up to 300,000 items per year.

03:41.313 --> 03:54.388
Normally in Germany, books which were published by the publishers are about 66,000 per year.

03:56.190 --> 04:04.760
And then there are books which were not published by publishers, another 66,000, and then there are dissertations and periodicals and so on.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.565
So there are about 60,000 different periodicals.

04:10.118 --> 04:20.029
We are still surprised that each year the number of printed titles are steadily growing.

04:21.470 --> 04:35.485
Last year Klaus-Dieter Lehmann decided, with the help of our government board, to reduce the steadily growing number of printed materials.

04:35.667 --> 04:45.759
that we no longer collect books if the new edition is totally the same as the old one.

04:45.779 --> 04:48.021
For example, there are some cooking books.

04:48.082 --> 04:53.528
You get the 25th edition, 26th edition, 22nd edition.

04:53.788 --> 05:00.156
And we said, if there is no change, just a new edition, we don't collect it.

05:00.356 --> 05:02.198
And so it was about 10%

05:03.308 --> 05:16.364
So we gave it to the publishers, if there is no change, just a new edition, we don't like it.

05:16.684 --> 05:24.474
And therefore, for the first time, the number of books was going a little down.

05:24.894 --> 05:32.303
But if you would keep in mind that you have the same figures as before, it would be

05:32.806 --> 05:41.940
It's just the unchanged editions we don't collect.

05:42.341 --> 05:46.427
It has a special problem in the living room.

05:46.447 --> 05:53.177
In the former time, if I had a pocket pocket and it was heavily used, I knew they would make a new edition.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.716
in two years' time, so I get a new one.

05:57.077 --> 06:09.599
And now if we are only one, it may be that some of those books are destroyed earlier.

06:09.619 --> 06:13.326
Were there many collections destroyed during the war?

06:13.745 --> 06:41.777
especially in the eastern part of Germany, in fact, when the Polonia and the Russians came, they took the collection to Russia and to Polonia, you know, the German tribe, said, please give us back our books, can we say, dear friends, you destroyed Russia, you destroyed Moscow, you destroyed, and what we should, please forget it, and there is still sort of

06:41.926 --> 06:56.425
the question whether a book belongs to pathway is or whether it should be this is still an open question what kind of books do they take just wear books they take anything

06:56.692 --> 07:07.352
And now as foreign books, I must be clear to say, it will offer you a Xerox or a microfilm.

07:07.653 --> 07:10.899
If you wish to use it, you may use a microfilm.

07:10.919 --> 07:17.552
If you are really interested, please, whether you go to Cambridge or to Oxford or to Krakow,

07:25.852 --> 07:32.864
Maybe in this way it could work.

07:34.147 --> 07:37.372
So, there were a lot of collections lost.

07:38.034 --> 07:39.216
Yes, yes.

07:39.516 --> 07:48.712
Either by bombing, or by... I actually didn't use anything, or nearly anything.

07:48.953 --> 07:50.155
It was...

07:50.438 --> 08:12.902
They lost quite a lot, because in the last years of the war, they brought for safe reasons, because they were afraid of bombing, but they wanted to the eastern part.

08:12.882 --> 08:16.872
And I was skeptical.

08:16.892 --> 08:19.538
It didn't have to do the building.

08:19.879 --> 08:22.646
It wasn't just the collection.

08:22.746 --> 08:24.971
You talk about an ironic situation.

08:25.072 --> 08:29.001
The building was spared.

08:29.572 --> 08:49.934
This is one of the reasons, because after the Second World War again, German libraries decided not to have one central library, because no library was strong enough, but to decentralize and say, please, Colonia is medicine, Hanover is technique.

08:50.255 --> 08:59.545
So each of the major library got one or more disciplines and get some money from the German Research Society to try to

08:59.727 --> 09:11.629
keep as a net, as complete as possible, but not to be like the Library of Congress, to get everything under one roof.

09:11.649 --> 09:12.832
So, next list.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.194
Well, this is great.

09:14.214 --> 09:15.697
This is very good.

09:15.717 --> 09:18.763
We're doing the price of things that I missed.

09:18.963 --> 09:20.065
You see, I like it too.

09:20.247 --> 09:21.889
It'll work, you see.

09:21.929 --> 09:29.496
This book is really about book culture, it's about philosophy, how people feel about the work.

09:29.957 --> 09:44.411
As for Peter Rafi, maybe, my private opinion is, for the time being, we have just 2%, 2%, which are non-printed electronic publications.

09:45.312 --> 09:46.533
The rest is printed.

09:47.694 --> 09:48.735
And this 2%,

09:49.306 --> 10:00.721
Whether it is internet or CD-ROMs, it is rather small, but in each newspaper, each journal, you just read on internet.

10:01.161 --> 10:08.751
So I think in our reading homes, now we have three reading homes, you will see it.

10:11.575 --> 10:17.963
One reading home is for periodicals, one is for books, and one is for multimedia.

10:18.179 --> 10:21.863
In the multimedia, we just have screens.

10:24.767 --> 10:28.551
And I'm a little sneaky.

10:28.791 --> 10:34.097
If you go in this multimedia, you see, for each screen, he's hugging.

10:35.299 --> 10:36.260
Is what?

10:36.680 --> 10:37.782
Hugging some boys.

10:37.822 --> 10:44.730
And the last GrÃ© de Tour, certainly one of my visitors.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.713
There's no serious worker at all in this room.

10:48.453 --> 10:51.898
How did you see it so quickly?

10:51.918 --> 10:56.886
I said, no one has a pencil or a piece of paper.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.150
She's just surfing, wasting my money.

11:01.552 --> 11:09.905
Yesterday evening, Thursday evening I had a check and there were about a quarter of the pencil and the paper.

11:10.225 --> 11:13.330
So I'm quite sure whether

11:13.512 --> 11:32.515
the main task of a library is to be an internet cafe, or whether the main task of a library should be to facilitate the access to serious literature, and not only to serve.

11:34.357 --> 11:42.186
Of course a library should offer such facilities too, but the question is balance.

11:42.622 --> 11:58.726
If they spend too much money from the budget to such modern things, and I have enough money to subscribe some additional important series, it could be difficult with E-Rex and some of the job-guiders.

11:58.746 --> 11:59.748
I have that.

11:59.848 --> 12:03.313
If we ask for money for computers, we get it.

12:03.665 --> 12:18.788
per screen, but it may ask for some money for subscription, and they say, sorry, and there's a small, the balance, it is not easy to see this balance.

12:18.808 --> 12:31.107
As for our budget, maybe it is, you mentioned that, we have now, before the reunion, we have 30 million, and now we have 60 million, the market.

12:34.023 --> 12:41.130
because Leipzig, we have 330 staff, they have 330 staff.

12:41.150 --> 12:44.894
What's the total number of workers in the building?

12:45.274 --> 12:48.277
The total number of workers in the building in Frankfurt is 330.

12:48.317 --> 12:49.798
That's not much at all.

12:49.818 --> 13:02.130
It's not much at all in your heart, but if we ask our names of finance, we say that you have another 330 in Leipzig.

13:02.391 --> 13:03.912
So you should be fair.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.742
count them together, then you have 660.

13:05.822 --> 13:18.753
And this is because, they say before, the very union of Germany, they said, we are the free national army, and we get all your books, and you did it.

13:19.234 --> 13:22.817
The catalytic, you announced it with those small stacks.

13:22.877 --> 13:27.901
And now you have the double number, and the number of complications have increased.

13:27.921 --> 13:30.784
Why the hell are you not happy?

13:30.804 --> 13:34.067
So that the publishing industry was the force behind

13:34.368 --> 13:36.251
establishing this library, right?

13:36.271 --> 13:36.532
Yes.

13:36.932 --> 13:41.080
And mainly as a repository for their own books.

13:41.140 --> 13:41.721
Yes, yes.

13:42.001 --> 13:52.820
In 1912, in the 1st, she said, we wish to have an archive for our own books, and for John one of the Austen ones.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.785
And later on, there's a John...

13:56.558 --> 13:58.740
And Payer said, we wish to join.

13:59.100 --> 14:04.726
But when they started, it was a division of the publisher's union.

14:05.046 --> 14:08.889
And so they went to Leipzig and went to Berlin.

14:08.909 --> 14:11.612
And Berlin was Prussia, and Prussia was the king.

14:11.912 --> 14:13.634
And they said, no, we want to be free.

14:14.034 --> 14:16.316
And so they did it in Leipzig.

14:16.336 --> 14:23.663
And then they made this commitment and said, each of our publishers will give one of these copies to Leipzig.

14:23.913 --> 14:24.714
And they did it.

14:25.175 --> 14:26.897
It really was of any law.

14:28.219 --> 14:36.690
And after the first immigration in Germany, we were in the late 20s immigration.

14:37.071 --> 14:39.254
Of course, the publishers lost the money too.

14:39.274 --> 14:44.441
Then the state government came and said, please, we keep the responsibility.

14:44.461 --> 14:51.851
And here in Frankfurt, in 1946, there was no federal republic of Germany.

14:51.871 --> 14:53.413
But the publisher said,

14:53.647 --> 15:22.506
sorry there is in Leipzig a nice building but we can't use it because the communists don't allow it therefore we wish for an interim period we always say for an interim period interim there in Frankfurt an interim till the reunion will come so the reunion was absolutely anticipated and the reunion was 40 years after nobody thought

15:22.975 --> 15:27.701
that the new union will come, that they decided to get a new building in Frankfurt.

15:27.981 --> 15:28.362
Anyway.

15:28.782 --> 15:37.673
Anyway, because nobody, and when the new building was nearly ready, suddenly the reunion came, and the Minister of Finance says, what a month!

15:37.953 --> 15:42.018
Now I have two nationalists!

15:42.038 --> 15:45.102
So I was quite sure if we would go to the museum,

15:45.368 --> 15:51.181
This day to Bonn, we at United, they would say, please go to that team.

15:51.401 --> 15:53.065
For 40 years you were crying.

15:53.526 --> 15:54.568
It is just an interim.

15:54.929 --> 15:55.831
And now you go.

15:56.833 --> 15:59.218
This really was planned as an interim.

15:59.338 --> 16:01.122
It was an interim.

16:01.142 --> 16:02.365
And therefore,

16:02.648 --> 16:06.073
But this new library was no longer planned as an intern.

16:06.093 --> 16:11.039
The old one... This one was not planned as an intern?

16:11.880 --> 16:12.040
No.

16:12.060 --> 16:13.562
This one was planned as an intern.

16:13.923 --> 16:19.911
It was just so many... It was rather... It was only in this time.

16:20.051 --> 16:28.302
And then we saw all the reunions will not come in the 18th century.

16:28.282 --> 16:37.156
So when was this building approved?

16:38.518 --> 16:56.145
This building was approved in 1900.

16:57.408 --> 16:58.149
in 1978.

16:58.169 --> 17:07.084
1978, this building here?

17:07.264 --> 17:13.214
Then you need 10 years, up to 1988, to make plans.

17:13.795 --> 17:18.943
In Germany they need nearly 10 years to make plans.

17:19.244 --> 17:48.525
the first and then the reunion you will remember was in 1999 and then it was finally decided to build one nobody thought there would be a reunion because this is called the next hundred years nobody expected to have the reunion within the next hundred years and two years after we had the reunion at the first dig right here it was in 1992

17:49.349 --> 17:52.493
And in 1997, it was formally open.

17:52.853 --> 17:57.279
So the first day, it was, this was just a lesson.

17:57.759 --> 18:00.262
So this came after the reunion, though.

18:00.282 --> 18:00.583
Yeah.

18:00.623 --> 18:04.487
The money came after the reunion.

18:04.507 --> 18:05.849
So we saw what happened.

18:05.869 --> 18:10.274
It was still under discussion, whether we need to.

18:10.374 --> 18:19.305
And we said, look, imagine they have Scotland, at Wales, at London,

18:19.707 --> 18:22.052
In Italy, they have no influence.

18:22.773 --> 18:24.296
Why shall we not have two?

18:26.000 --> 18:32.893
And our publishers said, yes, we are really clear that we have two because they didn't wish to destroy one of these libraries.

18:33.374 --> 18:35.218
But Mr. Pines was unhappy.

18:35.384 --> 18:37.427
But he was not strong.

18:37.447 --> 18:40.671
So in Leipzig, well, they really have, that's rather preservation.

18:40.691 --> 18:40.791
Yeah.

18:40.991 --> 18:45.977
But nevertheless, you see Leipzig has a huge reading room.

18:46.338 --> 19:00.295
They have more readers than in Frankfurt, because the other university libraries in the former DDR were rather poor, and therefore quite a lot of students of this region still use

19:00.646 --> 19:03.929
So the universities didn't have their own books?

19:04.089 --> 19:07.272
They were not enough to buy all Western German books.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.275
And Leipzig got a free copy.

19:10.655 --> 19:16.781
So Leipzig was in the only library, which is a complete set of German books.

19:16.801 --> 19:23.848
And of course, it was very important for some scientists.

19:24.128 --> 19:29.573
So Leipzig, we have here in Frankfurt just 20,000 students.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.731
users per year, Leipzig has 40,000.

19:32.751 --> 19:32.931
Wow.

19:32.951 --> 19:36.537
20,000 here?

19:36.637 --> 19:38.199
Here in Leipzig, 40,000.

19:38.860 --> 19:41.584
Leipzig, we close our... A lot, maybe 20,000.

19:41.664 --> 19:43.266
I would have thought more than that.

19:43.286 --> 19:47.272
Yes, but we say, hmm, there's a huge universal slide.

19:48.254 --> 19:53.822
It is not necessarily that each undergraduate uses our things.

19:53.842 --> 19:59.610
And the last thing, perhaps it's important for you, starting September 1st this year,

20:00.248 --> 20:00.909
quite new.

20:02.671 --> 20:08.417
For the first time in my life, we charge the leaders.

20:08.437 --> 20:19.529
The leaders were up, it was 2BP, now we charge either 30 DMK per year or 5 DMK per week.

20:24.254 --> 20:25.896
French chargers are free.

20:25.916 --> 20:26.236
Yeah.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.800
The first who started to charge were the Dutch.

20:30.505 --> 20:48.800
And we say, okay, we agree to charge as leaders, but only if we get the permission to use this money in addition to our official budget to hire some additional staffs, to increase the services.

20:49.181 --> 20:54.185
So we get this money as an extra money to our own budget.

20:54.285 --> 21:00.090
If you see, if you have 20,000 and this together is about 60,000,

21:00.931 --> 21:19.058
If you count it together, even if you would say only half of them, that by account you have just one million money more, and so you could hire some additional staff, because we are surprised when you open the library.

21:20.219 --> 21:30.431
We doubled the numbers of leaders because we have now about 350 seats, not too much, but it is more than doubled.

21:30.451 --> 21:36.198
And now the number of leaders increased, but the number of stairs in the stacks was the same.

21:36.818 --> 21:41.083
And they were all around.

21:41.224 --> 21:45.028
In the old timing, we need just one hour

21:46.375 --> 22:13.311
to get the book and now we are up to two hours because the number of readers have increased and the number of staff is still stable and therefore we say if we would hire with the help of this money some additional students we come down again to one hour our official statement

22:13.510 --> 22:37.442
we will go down to 30 minutes to house now wait and see when you when you check out a book yeah can you put it on the shelf but you have to return at the end of the day yeah if you take the book uh i would say in the leading room we have a reference library in the living room about 50 60 thousand

22:42.198 --> 22:51.852
the order from the stacks, in the evening you have to give it back, but not in the stacks, if they have a new church, so you can have it the next day.

22:51.972 --> 22:52.713
It is that it.

22:53.134 --> 23:08.035
And your private books, we have a piece where there's more shelves, you can lock it, and you're not obliged to bring them over each morning again.

23:08.055 --> 23:11.580
But this is our problem, for the first time,

23:11.864 --> 23:13.787
ask for fees.

23:13.807 --> 23:16.812
The majority of the leaders agree.

23:16.992 --> 23:22.501
If this money is used in addition to the service, I agree.

23:22.521 --> 23:29.652
Because serving Denmark per year is just half a day mark per week.

23:29.672 --> 23:30.694
It's not too much.

23:32.337 --> 23:36.343
But somewhere of Holy Weekend.

23:36.423 --> 23:38.867
The other problem, in our library you are

23:39.455 --> 23:42.018
allowed to work if you are 18 years old.

23:43.079 --> 23:53.330
But we don't like children which are three years or five years or six years because it's easy to use in public library, but we are in the public library, we are in national library.

23:53.930 --> 24:03.080
But now some of our leaders, people who are coming, they say, boy or girl, take care.

24:03.861 --> 24:08.466
And now our librarians, oh God, they're hugging on this

24:08.918 --> 24:09.860
How do you call it?

24:09.880 --> 24:15.329
And they are always afraid that it could fall down or break a crown or anything else.

24:15.489 --> 24:26.048
So we don't know what to do with those little babies because we are not a babysitting company in the library.

24:27.771 --> 24:29.935
But we have a solution.

24:29.955 --> 24:31.838
There is an opposite paragraph.

24:32.476 --> 24:34.479
use if you are 18 year old.

24:34.659 --> 24:40.348
But there is still a problem in the entrance hall.

24:41.810 --> 24:43.613
Some additional screens.

24:44.354 --> 24:51.364
So if a mother is coming with a baby, then we use this screen in the entrance hall.

24:51.444 --> 24:54.389
The baby is crying, or the dog is barking.

24:54.669 --> 24:59.696
He may do it in the entrance hall, but he didn't wish to have the babies inside.

24:59.877 --> 25:00.778
On the other hand,

25:01.282 --> 25:10.012
He is afraid of course to say, I do it like babies, because you are cool.

25:10.232 --> 25:13.736
Frankfurt is traditionally a book city, right?

25:13.756 --> 25:15.398
This is a book city for hundreds of years.

25:15.418 --> 25:29.854
Frankfurt and Leipzig, where since several hundred years, the most famous cities of books, the old book fairs, where they were in Frankfurt and in Leipzig, in 1630.

25:30.273 --> 25:35.959
and 1700s, 1800s, 1900s there were famous book fairs in Frankfurt and so on.

25:35.979 --> 25:44.467
It was always Leipzig and Frankfurt City of Pox, not Berlin or Munich, and therefore it was for historical reasons arrived.

25:44.827 --> 25:50.473
It's a national idea in Leipzig and Frankfurt.

25:50.513 --> 25:51.554
Now Leipzig also?

25:52.235 --> 25:56.719
The Publishers Union has its headquarters in Frankfurt.

25:57.374 --> 25:59.659
And that's downtown over there.

25:59.799 --> 26:02.205
It's downtown.

26:02.425 --> 26:04.450
What's that big building over there?

26:04.710 --> 26:05.512
Bank.

26:05.913 --> 26:07.597
All the banks.

26:07.697 --> 26:08.860
All banks.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.548
And this huge tower is that

26:13.102 --> 26:16.268
Book Fair is the message now.

26:16.388 --> 26:20.195
There are offices in the Venice Book Fair.

26:20.215 --> 26:20.956
That's next week.

26:21.357 --> 26:23.882
That's over there.

26:24.222 --> 26:29.733
If you wish to go there, there is a bus to the six stops.

26:30.434 --> 26:33.760
But you are saying over here, I think you are very big enough.

26:34.111 --> 26:39.440
Well, because the hotels are overcharged.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.864
I know, I tried to get it, I had to get it for six nights.

26:42.085 --> 26:48.315
It is really difficult to get one.

26:48.636 --> 26:59.815
Even the director, the president of the French Mission will come to see us and we had some problems to get a hotel.

27:00.790 --> 27:02.052
Well, that's okay.

27:02.072 --> 27:04.054
But perhaps next year or next year.

27:04.074 --> 27:05.376
Yeah, I'll come with you.

27:05.496 --> 27:11.865
But really, I wanted to see the facility and talk to you people about... Well, sorry.

27:12.045 --> 27:12.906
But you'll take place.

27:17.452 --> 27:23.120
The gentleman will give you some details on collections and the reason.

27:23.140 --> 27:29.008
The one thing perhaps he will not tell you is, if I tell you, if this is our governing board,

27:30.052 --> 27:41.930
In the governing board, there are 11, and then we have an advisory board.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.914
In the advisory board, there are 12.

27:44.934 --> 27:47.998
In the advisory board, we get the ideas.

27:48.019 --> 27:53.967
And here in this, six of them, 50%, are publishers.

27:53.987 --> 27:56.992
And here, five are publishers.

27:57.713 --> 27:59.215
Four are from the ministers.

27:59.988 --> 28:11.285
This is two times Minister of Internal Affairs, one Minister of Finance, very important, and one is Science and Technology.

28:11.305 --> 28:17.955
And then is one City of Frankfurt, because that's where we are.

28:18.095 --> 28:23.824
And one is Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, German Research Society.

28:24.465 --> 28:26.268
These are only professional.

28:26.288 --> 28:27.109
The rest are

28:28.237 --> 28:30.882
Publishers and publishers.

28:31.263 --> 28:34.149
Three are book publishers.

28:35.091 --> 28:41.324
One is recording, music recording, and one is music scores.

28:41.945 --> 28:47.236
So those are the three, and these are the ministers.

28:47.256 --> 28:48.558
Who preserves the newspapers?

28:48.638 --> 28:49.500
Do you do that here?

28:49.520 --> 28:49.941
We do it.

28:50.275 --> 29:10.731
But as for newspapers, the only exception, we just microfilm, we don't connect any newspaper in theological form, we microfilm, and because the binding and the dissipation, maybe

29:11.521 --> 29:24.737
Leipzig, I think Leipzig got permission to have a selection of 10, which you may have, you know, which is wrong, but the majority is in microphone.

29:24.757 --> 29:29.963
And the rest is, the newspapers are just in microphone.

29:29.983 --> 29:36.972
And so the number of payers together is 60,000.

29:37.813 --> 29:40.296
It's a steady increase of 3,000 per year.

29:41.187 --> 29:43.311
What did it pass to build this facility?

29:43.351 --> 29:44.092
What's the point?

29:44.112 --> 29:47.217
Yeah, it's important.

29:47.598 --> 29:56.173
When they started, 10 years ago, they said we need 260 million, but they just need 248.

29:56.714 --> 30:00.861
So it was a little cheaper than expected.

30:00.881 --> 30:02.183
Very reasonable.

30:02.365 --> 30:08.615
The French Library was a billion francs, 1.8 million, I think.

30:08.735 --> 30:12.501
And the British Library was like 800 million pounds.

30:12.521 --> 30:14.945
But this was just the building.

30:15.205 --> 30:20.794
The ground was another 24 for the government.

30:20.814 --> 30:23.097
So it's 268, 272.

30:23.117 --> 30:27.785
272 million.

30:27.885 --> 30:28.626
That's not bad.

30:29.045 --> 30:33.490
The figures are in this paper which I give you, but nevertheless you will.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.511
Okay.

30:34.671 --> 30:36.332
It's good to know.

30:36.352 --> 30:39.195
Well, actually you came in much less than the British and the French.

30:39.355 --> 30:42.158
Yes, but we must be clear.

30:42.218 --> 30:50.467
The Christians, the French, they have books from the 17th century, the 18th century, the 19th century, they have books from abroad.

30:50.907 --> 30:57.634
So if you compare the size, as a discipline, to the mission, so I think

30:57.935 --> 31:09.086
We sometimes say we give just the core of the nucleus of the national library according to the definition of UNESCO, they say.

31:09.666 --> 31:19.075
The national library is always a library which has a depot legal for its, and this we have, and which is preparing the national bibliography.

31:19.336 --> 31:24.781
We do.

31:24.801 --> 31:24.921
Sorry.

31:31.060 --> 31:57.185
I was supposed to go to mines yesterday, but the plane didn't leave seven hours late, so forget it.

31:57.246 --> 31:59.768
I didn't get to see it, so that's the way that happened.

32:00.068 --> 32:01.671
Do you have the cards too?

32:01.891 --> 32:04.656
I forgot them at home.

32:04.877 --> 32:07.561
I have your letters.

32:07.662 --> 32:12.691
If I have some additional ideas, I will send them to you.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.334
What I'll do is I'll send you an email.

32:14.835 --> 32:21.266
Have you ever been at the Inflaminate?

32:22.528 --> 32:23.230
No.

32:23.250 --> 32:23.410
Not yet.

32:23.677 --> 32:25.600
Now where is that?

32:25.800 --> 32:31.950
Once a year there is a meeting of all director generals and all specialists.

32:31.970 --> 32:34.434
This year it was in Copenhagen.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.116
It's always in August.

32:36.136 --> 32:38.300
It was Copenhagen.

32:39.141 --> 32:43.127
There were about 2500 librarians.

32:43.147 --> 32:45.010
And next year it is in Amsterdam.

32:45.431 --> 32:51.220
So if you wish to get additional information without traveling a lot,

32:51.385 --> 33:20.363
you've got the majority in one place with some good papers and so on but only if you wish next year is amsterdam and in 1990s bangkok it's far away hot and really i was there when i was on a service a million years ago okay and then in 2000 is jerusalem but next year is something and so the last 25 years i had each villa so i got quite a lot of

33:20.697 --> 33:21.779
How do you spell that?

33:21.859 --> 33:29.931
International Federation of the Library Associations, IFLA.

33:29.951 --> 33:37.903
Could you tell me who you are, please?

33:38.985 --> 33:40.567
Well, I'm Bernard Stephan.

33:41.789 --> 33:46.857
I'm the Director of Central Services and Archiving.

33:47.714 --> 34:00.456
Central services means not only services to the users in the library, but also for the services which we deliver or which we offer to other libraries.

34:01.618 --> 34:13.519
That means bibliographic services, research services, and all these things, document delivery and all.

34:14.630 --> 34:20.296
what you can imagine a library can offer on services.

34:20.316 --> 34:21.117
And how do you split it?

34:21.137 --> 34:23.560
Do you have a card that I could have?

34:23.600 --> 34:24.341
Yeah.

34:24.581 --> 34:25.202
In the library.

34:25.222 --> 34:33.811
So if you could just do it mentioning that you deal with actually the services that... Yeah.

34:33.831 --> 34:40.158
Could you tell me, why don't we just start very generally about what you do, what your services involve?

34:40.178 --> 34:41.700
Well, the services...

34:41.984 --> 34:49.192
as I said, are divided in services for other libraries, which mean bibliographic services.

34:51.255 --> 34:57.462
And in this case, we deliver to other libraries bibliographic records.

34:58.543 --> 35:11.518
They can decide whether they want to have all our range of records, that means records of books within the book trade, without the book trade,

35:11.971 --> 35:19.319
records of music or whatever you can imagine.

35:20.340 --> 35:27.067
These records came out from the cataloging for the national bibliography.

35:28.889 --> 35:40.020
And we have the feeling that a lot of German libraries, at least, use these records for cataloging.

35:40.372 --> 36:10.176
just not to do the same work a second time so they use our records for cataloging in some cases only for help of cataloging so they use it as a copy or something like that and then they changed for their purposes our records but in

36:11.354 --> 36:29.899
many cases, they use our records as they are in the original form, just to have the same records as they were given in the national bibliography.

36:30.340 --> 36:40.213
In Germany, perhaps you know that there are a lot of regional library centers, library service centers,

36:42.269 --> 36:53.747
And these regional library service centers hold our records as a mirror for their customers.

36:54.388 --> 37:04.004
So if you go to the region of, or to the state of Bavaria, there is a Bavarian state library service center.

37:04.725 --> 37:09.272
And in this service center you will find our records

37:10.467 --> 37:14.292
in the same way you find it in our catalogs.

37:15.834 --> 37:36.559
And the Bavarian libraries use their system just to add their signatures and to add the book numbers, shelf numbers, so they have their records

37:37.872 --> 37:40.735
all the records together in one database.

37:41.236 --> 37:53.870
Just taking hours for the German books and then add foreign records like US MARC records or whatever to the same database.

37:54.251 --> 38:04.943
They changed these foreign formats from, for instance, US MARC to MAP.

38:05.733 --> 38:09.117
which means German mark format.

38:10.438 --> 38:24.634
And so they have all the records together in one database, but connected through the book numbers, shelf numbers, and signatures of the different libraries.

38:24.915 --> 38:26.717
I see.

38:26.737 --> 38:31.202
Your mandate is really to work strictly with German language material.

38:31.362 --> 38:31.582
Right.

38:32.043 --> 38:32.483
Right.

38:33.070 --> 38:40.618
restricted to German language materials or foreign language materials which were published in Germany.

38:41.379 --> 38:50.849
So if a book is published in English, for instance from the Springer Publishing House in Germany, we will collect it, of course.

38:51.570 --> 38:58.177
So we have two things, German language and Germany-based publishers.

38:58.958 --> 39:02.942
How about German books in translation, like Luther Grass in English?

39:03.327 --> 39:07.672
We collect these things in Leipzig.

39:08.753 --> 39:11.756
You know already that we are two houses.

39:11.796 --> 39:21.587
So we collect these things, translations and books about Germany.

39:22.147 --> 39:33.199
We collect these things only one time in Leipzig because they have the longer and older tradition in collecting these materials.

39:33.685 --> 39:38.151
And we have to buy these materials, you know.

39:38.191 --> 39:40.954
These are deposit materials.

39:41.115 --> 39:44.239
They are not deposit materials.

39:44.619 --> 39:47.302
We have to buy them, and it's very expensive.

39:47.583 --> 40:00.199
So we buy only one copy that we can report about these books in our bibliography, that we know there are these books,

40:00.601 --> 40:10.656
But it's not necessary to have these books in two copies in both stans, in both libraries, not only in Leipzig, but also in Frankfurt.

40:10.716 --> 40:14.943
We collect them only in Leipzig.

40:15.363 --> 40:15.604
Interesting.

40:16.445 --> 40:26.880
In terms of the computerization of things, you aren't really involved in any kind of retrospective conversion of your collection.

40:27.001 --> 40:28.583
We do these things.

40:29.390 --> 40:35.717
We help other libraries to do these retrospective conversions with our data.

40:35.737 --> 40:45.368
So we deliver our data from 1945 on in a machine readable form.

40:45.969 --> 40:53.518
Though other libraries can use our data for retrospective conversion.

40:54.058 --> 40:58.063
But we convert also, or we will convert,

40:58.381 --> 41:26.953
also our catalog the older parts of the catalog in leipzig you perhaps know that leipzig starts his their collection in 1913 and 13 13 right okay and we will convert these catalogs in the next

41:27.271 --> 41:39.324
I don't know, perhaps five or six years to make them available in a machine readable form.

41:39.344 --> 41:52.157
And at the moment we look for in system how we can do that in a way cheap but sufficient way.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.300
That's always the problem.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.502
And because

41:57.123 --> 42:03.353
these catalog cards we have in Leipzig are way, way different.

42:04.835 --> 42:20.941
So you will find handwritten cards, you will find machine-typed cards, but in a very old typing manner.

42:22.203 --> 42:24.767
And you find also

42:24.899 --> 42:29.705
modern cards, of course, but it's very difficult to read them.

42:29.945 --> 42:32.308
So we can't use scanning.

42:33.730 --> 42:37.935
It's difficult.

42:38.015 --> 42:42.421
It's really, really difficult to do this with scanning.

42:43.002 --> 42:54.636
There is now, I think, one possibility they have used it already in Zurich for the central libraries.

42:55.510 --> 43:00.379
And this might be a possibility to convert our data in Leipzig.

43:01.521 --> 43:14.022
But it's also very difficult to give these cards just for typing it again to people in South Asia or somewhere, or China.

43:14.884 --> 43:17.789
They can't read it, the handwritten things.

43:18.150 --> 43:19.512
These are handwritten things?

43:19.712 --> 43:20.033
Yeah.

43:20.570 --> 43:22.353
Well, that's the problem.

43:22.393 --> 43:23.394
I can see that.

43:23.455 --> 43:24.777
This is really a problem.

43:24.857 --> 43:26.179
I didn't realize it was handwritten.

43:26.199 --> 43:28.302
It's partly handwritten.

43:28.322 --> 43:33.891
It's partly machine-typed, but machine-typed in different formats.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.113
Yeah, with typefaces.

43:35.253 --> 43:39.860
You can really, to scan things, it should be an electric typewriter.

43:40.121 --> 43:41.042
Right, yeah.

43:41.208 --> 43:44.711
But there are annotations, handwritten annotations.

43:45.812 --> 43:50.416
That's impossible for... And you're probably talking about millions of cards too, right?

43:50.717 --> 43:51.017
Right.

43:51.057 --> 43:53.599
It must be around two million.

43:53.699 --> 43:54.160
Two million.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.581
Two million of cards.

43:56.041 --> 43:56.242
Wow.

43:56.282 --> 43:58.544
So you keep cards, right?

43:58.664 --> 44:02.407
You still have a card... Not here, but in Leipzig, yes.

44:02.647 --> 44:04.950
You will see it too many in Leipzig, I'm sure.

44:05.050 --> 44:06.671
So everything here is online then?

44:07.091 --> 44:08.533
We are totally online.

44:08.593 --> 44:10.995
We don't have any cards.

44:11.448 --> 44:19.119
except in a hidden part in the cellar somewhere there is still a card catalog.

44:19.139 --> 44:20.321
Yeah, but is it maintained?

44:20.982 --> 44:21.182
No.

44:22.123 --> 44:23.585
So what's the cutoff date on that?

44:23.605 --> 44:28.432
Yeah, it's cutoff after 1989, I think.

44:28.632 --> 44:36.984
So did you have the same kind of controversy here that we've had in the States with the discontinuation of card catalogs?

44:37.004 --> 44:37.345
Oh, right.

44:37.445 --> 44:39.007
We have it.

44:39.147 --> 44:39.548
Of course.

44:42.228 --> 44:53.363
They always want to keep their old things just to work in and make... It's palpable, it's real, it's tactile.

44:53.723 --> 44:54.805
How do you feel about that?

44:56.267 --> 45:04.899
Well, I think our online catalog is very good and very sufficient, and it's not necessary to keep the card catalog.

45:05.179 --> 45:09.324
But how about on a day like today when the computers are down, though?

45:09.345 --> 45:10.286
That's the problem.

45:10.626 --> 45:11.948
That's the problem.

45:12.367 --> 45:18.820
I'm sorry, I walked into it, but it's too good to overlook.

45:18.880 --> 45:19.882
We don't know what to do.

45:20.203 --> 45:32.046
So what we now try to do is to install stand-alone computers with CD-ROM.

45:35.063 --> 45:40.532
Yeah, that we can use our CD-ROM as a catalog.

45:41.153 --> 45:48.405
But, well, the CD-ROM is always two months late, up to two months late.

45:48.525 --> 45:50.769
So that's right, we produce it outside.

45:51.190 --> 45:54.395
Yeah, we produce it six times a year.

45:55.076 --> 45:58.422
So what you just hope is

46:00.747 --> 46:04.292
But there's always a give and a take, isn't there?

46:04.332 --> 46:05.053
You have to give up.

46:05.974 --> 46:11.561
But it does show you how much we are slaves to our technology, don't you think?

46:11.581 --> 46:12.662
Yeah, that's right.

46:13.223 --> 46:13.744
Yeah, that's right.

46:14.224 --> 46:23.877
So, well, it's a funny thing to come this morning to the library and say, I have the first sentence.

46:24.337 --> 46:27.902
No, it's wonderful.

46:28.692 --> 46:31.395
I'm a writer.

46:31.495 --> 46:33.177
I love dramatic scenes.

46:35.159 --> 46:37.883
Believe me, I love your facility here.

46:38.483 --> 46:39.745
Well, it's wonderful.

46:39.845 --> 46:41.787
The new library is really wonderful.

46:41.947 --> 46:45.471
I think everybody from the staff loves it very much.

46:45.491 --> 46:50.818
And also our users love it very much.

46:50.838 --> 46:52.479
Have you seen the new French library?

46:52.720 --> 46:55.303
Yeah, and of course the British library.

46:55.323 --> 46:57.265
I've been to both myself.

46:58.223 --> 47:28.163
they are fantastic buildings but if you see that they need 400 people more only for guarding the building that's horrible in in in paris this is it's really horrible and my life i i think it's it's not a way in

47:28.430 --> 47:30.912
Well, the French in particular.

47:30.932 --> 47:32.334
I don't think the British has that.

47:32.354 --> 47:33.755
Do you think the British has that?

47:33.775 --> 47:36.077
No, not the British, but the French.

47:36.757 --> 47:43.764
The French, of course, is an architectural statement that has nothing to do with books, I don't think.

47:43.784 --> 47:49.189
I mean, the books were incidental in the equation, it seems to me.

47:49.229 --> 47:52.672
It's very difficult to get a book.

47:52.692 --> 47:58.437
You know all the different controls between, and you have to have

47:58.822 --> 48:05.532
a card for this reading room, then you need a second card for an elaborated reading room, and all these things.

48:05.872 --> 48:09.237
This, I think, is really horrible and not very democratic.

48:09.337 --> 48:16.127
I mean, it's just those towers going up like they did when they really should have been going down, like everybody else.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.851
Of course, when you went into the river down there, too.

48:18.871 --> 48:19.853
Of course, yeah.

48:20.293 --> 48:27.183
It's not possible in this side, but... But like you said, they have, what, 400 people there for security?

48:27.324 --> 48:27.664
Yeah.

48:28.657 --> 48:32.221
And that's more than the whole total workforce here.

48:32.542 --> 48:32.842
Right.

48:33.863 --> 48:46.318
They have now, I think, two and a half, 2.300,000 people stuck in both buildings, in the new one and in... How many now?

48:46.939 --> 48:47.300
2,300.

48:47.360 --> 48:48.781
2,300.

48:49.122 --> 48:50.984
I think that's about right, too.

48:51.865 --> 48:54.669
Chris, they do more.

48:54.709 --> 48:58.173
Their mission is more comprehensive than yours.

48:58.193 --> 48:58.393
Of course.

49:02.238 --> 49:05.242
how many stuffs they need for the reading rooms.

49:06.083 --> 49:10.349
They have more places, of course, in the reading rooms.

49:11.651 --> 49:21.045
The approach of the whole thing is totally different from ours, I see.

49:21.065 --> 49:28.515
Well, I wonder if they consulted librarians when they built that building.

49:28.715 --> 49:31.158
They said they have, but I'm not sure.

49:31.259 --> 49:34.984
Well, yeah, because they had their Dominique Carroll was 36 years old.

49:35.124 --> 49:38.669
I mean, he was building a... They tell you it was a cultural statement.

49:38.729 --> 49:52.929
It was a statement that... I think the architect was not Carroll, but at least the president.

49:52.949 --> 49:54.771
Dominique Carroll, he loved it.

49:54.791 --> 49:55.232
Yeah.

49:56.414 --> 49:57.355
He loved this.

49:57.841 --> 49:59.343
That's right, yeah.

49:59.603 --> 50:01.726
Of course, the French loves to have great symbols.

50:01.806 --> 50:07.774
But I talked to this woman, Jacqueline Sanson, and I said, well, what do you think about this?

50:08.835 --> 50:13.241
She said, you know, what I think is irrelevant.

50:13.261 --> 50:16.686
This is what I've been given to work with, and I make the best of it.

50:16.746 --> 50:17.807
And I thought that was a very...

50:18.361 --> 50:19.222
honest dancer.

50:19.282 --> 50:24.108
She's not going to tell me what she thinks, but she's not going to tell me it's great either.

50:24.148 --> 50:27.493
She just says, look, this is what they gave me, and this is what I'm going to wear.

50:27.513 --> 50:30.416
And they are not very happy with their offices, too.

50:31.357 --> 50:42.632
They are really... I mean, I was in the offices of senior people, and maybe one-third the size of this particular office.

50:42.652 --> 50:47.558
And you've got a beautiful corner here, a nice... But I have to say my office is

50:48.179 --> 50:49.561
Especially very beautiful.

50:50.022 --> 50:51.584
I think it's very beautiful.

50:52.205 --> 50:54.369
Of course, Mr. Lehmanns or Mr. Nowak.

50:54.389 --> 50:55.671
They are wonderful.

50:55.951 --> 50:58.796
They are really wonderful.

50:59.677 --> 51:11.736
Well, but I think the duties are different between the French National Library and the British National Library and our National Library.

51:12.137 --> 51:14.220
Maybe you could distinguish the three, in your view.

51:15.145 --> 51:28.601
Well, the others, they have a wide duty to collect all materials from all over the world.

51:29.041 --> 51:35.729
They will collect everything, I think, if they have enough money for that.

51:35.830 --> 51:37.091
The Grinch in particular.

51:37.111 --> 51:38.653
Yeah.

51:38.673 --> 51:42.217
Well, they don't have the money at the moment.

51:43.679 --> 51:44.680
And...

51:46.702 --> 52:01.224
Well, I think these two libraries are part of a still relevant, I think, colonial approach.

52:02.165 --> 52:15.645
Well, we are not longer, let's say in another way, we don't longer have

52:16.418 --> 52:23.265
colonies around the world, but we want to know what is happening there all around.

52:23.405 --> 52:29.972
And we can do this by collecting books from all over the world.

52:30.732 --> 52:38.260
Well, the Americans have the also... Library of Congress does the same thing.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.883
Yeah, and they have field offices all around there.

52:41.903 --> 52:45.447
Library of Congress actually has people all over the world buying books.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.805
And also, when you think of the British Library, English is the official language.

52:50.825 --> 52:52.307
I think it's 75 countries.

52:53.308 --> 52:54.009
Think about that.

52:55.150 --> 52:58.093
But more people are speaking Spanish than English.

52:58.714 --> 52:59.454
Is that right?

52:59.474 --> 52:59.614
Yeah.

53:00.896 --> 53:05.921
Spanish is the most spoken language in the world, except of Chinese.

53:08.164 --> 53:09.085
That surprises me.

53:09.485 --> 53:09.625
Yeah.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.328
Because there are a lot of Spanish-speaking people in the world.

53:15.548 --> 53:16.529
Very interesting.

53:16.629 --> 53:21.695
And then to get to your mandate, you mentioned to distinguish the French and the British.

53:22.616 --> 53:39.997
Well, we just restricted our legal duties to German publications, or publications in German, and publications from out Germany.

53:40.999 --> 53:42.180
That means we collect

53:42.447 --> 54:06.269
all these things from Austria and Switzerland, Switzerland in German, or Italy, for instance, in German, and also from German colonies, I can say, in South America.

54:06.530 --> 54:12.235
Of course, Argentina is one of the examples.

54:12.535 --> 54:15.880
Also German books from Kazakhstan, for instance.

54:16.601 --> 54:21.868
We collect these things, but in German or about Germany.

54:22.709 --> 54:29.138
And we collect all the things which appear in Germany.

54:29.579 --> 54:40.715
That means if there is a book appearing in Swahili, but from a German publisher, we will collect these things.

54:40.735 --> 54:40.855
I see.

54:42.320 --> 54:46.888
So, what are the numbers of books you have?

54:46.908 --> 54:48.471
They're like six million?

54:48.571 --> 54:51.757
We have here in Frankfurt around seven million.

54:51.777 --> 54:52.538
Seven million.

54:52.558 --> 54:53.219
Seven million.

54:53.500 --> 54:56.926
And in Leipzig around eight million.

54:57.547 --> 54:58.108
That's a lot.

54:58.789 --> 55:03.317
Yeah, that's different because they collect since 1913.

55:03.337 --> 55:05.982
And there is no replication.

55:06.162 --> 55:07.264
Right.

55:07.565 --> 55:17.498
In the last 40 years, 50 years, there was a little bit different application of these things.

55:19.341 --> 55:33.900
But the more interesting number is that we have at the moment around 300,000 new titles in our bibliography.

55:33.921 --> 55:35.222
Wow.

55:35.242 --> 55:35.783
Around...

55:36.742 --> 55:45.010
80,000 titles from all the book trade publishers and such things.

55:45.030 --> 55:50.796
Around 10,000 electronic publications.

55:50.816 --> 55:52.097
What, each year now?

55:52.117 --> 55:53.198
Each year.

55:53.458 --> 55:53.979
You had this.

55:54.059 --> 55:55.941
Yeah.

55:55.981 --> 56:05.149
So, in total, we come to a number of around 300,000 new records a year.

56:05.169 --> 56:05.770
No, we're not talking.

56:06.003 --> 56:12.734
Strictly about books, we're talking periodicals, journals, newspapers, any matter of thing, right?

56:13.275 --> 56:15.599
Electronic publications.

56:15.619 --> 56:15.799
Right.

56:18.083 --> 56:25.896
Do you deal with maintaining the particular item, for instance?

56:25.916 --> 56:32.447
Yes, partly, but our center for maintaining these for conservation and preservation is Leipzig.

56:32.467 --> 56:32.567
Okay.

56:32.834 --> 56:36.078
But in terms of an electronic publication?

56:36.118 --> 56:37.079
This is here.

56:37.299 --> 56:39.522
This center is here in France.

56:39.642 --> 56:44.027
I hope I get to see something like that today during this visit.

56:44.327 --> 56:57.903
Well, you can't see very much at the moment because our system also is dealing with our multimedia access system.

56:58.484 --> 57:01.407
But the idea is that we...

57:02.180 --> 57:12.894
Well, in the stacks, of course, we have electronic publications, hand-hold things, that means CD-ROMs or tapes or something like that.

57:14.175 --> 57:29.875
But the idea is to give access to these publications through our multimedia access system.

57:31.087 --> 57:52.589
in which we have at the moment around 130 CD-ROMs already installed for using in-house and we will have around 2000 CD-ROMs prepared for access in a jukebox system.

57:54.711 --> 57:55.272
They are

57:55.572 --> 58:04.506
pre-installed, though that a user can use them directly from our PCs in the multimedia reading room.

58:05.448 --> 58:09.194
But this is future thinking at the moment.

58:09.494 --> 58:22.795
How do you ensure that a piece of work that originates strictly through electronic means, not on CD-ROM, but that is really just stored through computer?

58:23.095 --> 58:25.359
Yeah, you mean online publications.

58:25.779 --> 58:34.693
How do you make sure that you're going to... What assurances are there that you will be able to maintain a permanent record?

58:35.034 --> 58:39.501
Well, this is... I'm going to put this on the other side.
