WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:04.425
Now we're talking to Diane Crescent.

00:04.445 --> 00:06.968
Diane, what's her official title, might I ask?

00:07.329 --> 00:08.130
Well, I've got two.

00:08.831 --> 00:17.701
I've got Director for Preservation, and I'm also the Acting Director for Public Service Collections.

00:18.922 --> 00:19.763
And what does that mean?

00:19.783 --> 00:31.337
That means all of the reading rooms where people come to use collections and all of the divisions that support acquiring, cataloging, serving, preserving the collections are all under me.

00:32.245 --> 00:34.808
with a couple of exceptions.

00:34.828 --> 00:35.429
The rare books?

00:36.009 --> 00:42.417
Rare books, prints and photographs, manuscripts, geography and map, motion picture.

00:42.977 --> 00:55.772
The only ones that are not are the area studies divisions, and there are four of those, European, Asian, those kinds of things, and the law library, that's a separate organization.

00:56.410 --> 00:57.511
Are you a librarian?

00:57.611 --> 00:58.912
Yes.

00:58.932 --> 00:59.833
Did you go to library school?

00:59.853 --> 01:00.234
Yes, I did.

01:00.694 --> 01:08.922
I went to Catholic University, and I'm currently adjunct faculty on their library school staff.

01:08.982 --> 01:10.203
So they still have a library school?

01:10.223 --> 01:11.284
They still have a library school.

01:11.645 --> 01:12.566
It's alive and well.

01:14.287 --> 01:15.689
It's here in Washington?

01:15.729 --> 01:22.075
I think because we're in the Washington area and there are so many cultural institutions, it's still, I think, a thriving program.

01:22.095 --> 01:24.257
There's also a program at the University of Maryland.

01:24.676 --> 01:26.538
in College Park Library School.

01:27.059 --> 01:32.065
Well, I'd like to get a census just to make library schools that are left.

01:32.085 --> 01:32.946
Well, there are fewer.

01:33.286 --> 01:36.190
I don't know offhand.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.873
I mean the big one is like Columbia.

01:39.794 --> 01:41.016
Which is history.

01:41.036 --> 01:41.736
Yeah, closed.

01:42.057 --> 01:44.700
And I think the University of Chicago closed it.

01:46.762 --> 01:49.806
Illinois, I mean a lot of places closed them.

01:52.435 --> 01:55.600
And of course, something like Berkeley is now something else.

01:55.660 --> 01:56.081
Right.

01:57.643 --> 02:00.788
You know, and the profession continues to sort of change.

02:02.471 --> 02:19.337
There's less of an emphasis probably on traditional skills like cataloging and more of an emphasis on database searching, information management through networked environments and acquiring software and

02:19.823 --> 02:22.147
Probably a very heavy emphasis on it.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.810
Yeah, I mean, that's increasingly.

02:23.930 --> 02:32.283
So, I mean, there's still room for the traditional approaches, but it's in a different context.

02:33.085 --> 02:46.827
I am looking at libraries and the whole concept of libraries, and just coincidentally, we walked in and here's a book called I Want to Be a Librarian, over for very early readers, 1960, which makes it 37 years old.

02:47.465 --> 02:50.449
And you were mentioning how stereotypical it is.

02:50.469 --> 02:55.055
Every librarian in here is a woman with some bun in the hair.

02:55.075 --> 02:55.996
Right, the bun in the hair.

02:56.737 --> 03:02.926
She didn't have the tissue in her sleeve, but I'm sure that that would have, if they'd made the film version, it would have been that.

03:03.486 --> 03:05.149
She would have been played by June Lockhart.

03:06.210 --> 03:08.974
You mentioned that you found this on the truck.

03:10.295 --> 03:12.318
What truck were we found?

03:12.338 --> 03:16.003
We have a selection office, and maybe if we have time,

03:16.844 --> 03:19.687
There are four sort of critical areas of the library.

03:19.707 --> 03:28.138
There's acquisitions, cataloging, preservation, and then kind of the reference service.

03:29.319 --> 03:32.763
Typically those were, in the past, stand-alone departments.

03:32.984 --> 03:38.410
They're all now contained under one department called Library Services.

03:38.490 --> 03:41.694
But this is kind of the core of activities of the Library of Congress.

03:42.655 --> 03:46.480
So there's a selection office, materials that come into the library

03:47.084 --> 04:03.579
by copyright, sometimes by purchase or gift or exchange, are reexamined by selecting officers to make sure that they're within scope.

04:03.599 --> 04:08.223
So this was on a truck of, I believe, copyright deposit material.

04:09.684 --> 04:15.910
Probably the library looked at it when it was first published because there's a mandatory deposit requirement.

04:16.379 --> 04:20.443
books published in the United States get offered to the Library of Congress.

04:22.165 --> 04:24.087
Are they required to give you?

04:24.107 --> 04:24.647
Correct.

04:24.667 --> 04:32.636
They're required to give us, whether we select them for our collections or not, depends on whether it's in scope for our collections.

04:32.776 --> 04:39.543
Just about everything is, but there are some broad categories like clinical medicine, technical agriculture, for example, which aren't.

04:40.464 --> 04:45.829
So that book probably came in in 1960 originally, and we looked at it and said, well,

04:46.383 --> 04:52.733
Yeah, yes, we want it, but we only want one copy, or yes, we want it, and we want two copies, or no, we don't.

04:53.194 --> 05:00.686
And then for 37 years, it's been held as a copyright deposit, separate and distinct from the library's collections.

05:00.826 --> 05:13.386
So this was part of a bunch of materials that were children's literature, biographies, and material like this that were, I think, up for re-examining.

05:14.412 --> 05:17.035
I think we should keep as much of this as possible.

05:17.055 --> 05:23.343
I happened to be in there for another reason, and there it was.

05:23.524 --> 05:29.812
I was struck by so many familiar titles on the truck that I remember reading when I was in elementary school.

05:29.832 --> 05:31.374
These were all children's books.

05:31.394 --> 05:33.957
Johnny Tremaine, Rifles for Wadey,

05:34.072 --> 05:43.981
You know, Louisa May Alcott, girl author, you know, that whole Bob's Merrill series of biographies for children that I devoured when I was, you know, eight and nine and ten.

05:44.001 --> 05:45.802
So, yeah, those kinds of things.

05:45.862 --> 06:02.116
And what we would do probably is look at that truck and compare it against what's already in our collections and whether we still had the first copy or whether it's somehow been lost or, you know, destroyed or ravaged by time or whatever and use this as a replacement, that kind of thing.

06:02.136 --> 06:03.117
So somebody would check

06:04.177 --> 06:08.181
to indicate whether or not there is still a first copy.

06:09.863 --> 06:16.991
But is it possible that, you know, this has gone into the selection room, put on the truck, so to speak?

06:17.152 --> 06:19.074
Is it possible that this is the last copy?

06:21.076 --> 06:21.256
Sure.

06:21.276 --> 06:25.601
So you do get rid of, occasionally, last copies?

06:25.621 --> 06:25.681
No.

06:27.183 --> 06:28.384
Let me rephrase that.

06:29.625 --> 06:31.888
We don't get rid of anything

06:32.493 --> 06:34.535
Unless it's... Or deaccession?

06:34.896 --> 06:39.181
We deaccession, like textbooks, superseded editions.

06:39.641 --> 06:48.292
Twenty-five editions of an accounting textbook will keep one copy of each preceding one, as opposed to two.

06:48.932 --> 06:53.678
Typically, English language publications, domestic publications, we keep two copies.

06:56.281 --> 06:57.683
Major trade publications.

06:59.745 --> 07:01.487
If, for some reason...

07:01.940 --> 07:07.666
the selection office and the recommending officers determine that we only need one copy, then we keep one copy.

07:08.466 --> 07:19.037
If we go to the shelf looking for the one copy that our bibliographic records claim we should still have and it's not there, it's misplaced, it's lost, maybe it was stolen, you know, those kinds of things.

07:19.137 --> 07:23.461
But it rarely is that we decided we didn't want it anymore.

07:23.481 --> 07:31.609
I mean, typically when things are collected, they're retained for the permanent collections, and they're in the permanent collections forever.

07:32.264 --> 07:33.825
Are there criteria?

07:34.206 --> 07:36.688
Yes.

07:36.708 --> 07:45.076
Published, printed guidelines that very strictly define the principles you apply?

07:45.096 --> 07:45.176
Yes.

07:45.556 --> 07:47.458
They're called collections policy statements.

07:47.538 --> 07:49.320
Will this be something I can get a copy of?

07:49.360 --> 07:49.820
Yes.

07:49.981 --> 07:52.903
They're in hard copy up to a certain date.

07:54.184 --> 07:55.466
I've got a notebook here.

07:55.486 --> 07:58.248
I don't know how current it is, but now we put them online.

08:00.771 --> 08:01.191
Oh good.

08:02.605 --> 08:06.870
I'm getting into this, and I'm going to make it readable for the general reason.

08:06.890 --> 08:07.631
Well, I hope you do.

08:07.651 --> 08:09.513
I think it's really interesting.

08:10.234 --> 08:10.995
I think it's fascinating.

08:11.015 --> 08:20.647
It's part of the library that a lot of people don't often focus on, and the acquisitions and how we take care of things, to me, are sort of the heart of what we're all about.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.552
So I don't have to go get a card copy of this?

08:25.572 --> 08:26.574
No, I don't think so.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.596
Actually, you may have that.

08:29.251 --> 08:31.254
You mean you're going to let me in?

08:31.274 --> 08:32.156
You could have it, yeah.

08:32.176 --> 08:32.937
Oh, you're going to let me have it.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.800
Yes, you may have it, and that's for starters.

08:34.820 --> 08:35.661
That's wonderful.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.868
And then I think— Look at how my face brightens.

08:39.888 --> 08:40.229
I know.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.312
I love that.

08:42.332 --> 08:43.274
Well, this is great.

08:43.294 --> 08:44.476
This will work.

08:44.496 --> 08:55.714
And then there's, on the library's homepage— Which is www.loc?

08:56.960 --> 09:13.642
Actually, it's not even www.http colon, two backflashes, lcweb.loc.gov.

09:14.163 --> 09:23.035
And somewhere, when we're done talking, I want to show you, you can access the

09:23.167 --> 09:26.152
Yeah, the collection's policy statements.

09:26.172 --> 09:34.687
All of the recommending officers are routinely asked to revise and update their series.

09:36.089 --> 09:39.114
We have them on all formats.

09:40.497 --> 09:46.086
We have about 25 of them currently in a state of review.

09:46.471 --> 09:53.119
Either the draft has been completed and it's being circulated for discussion and comment, or it's about to be reissued.

09:53.319 --> 10:04.813
So it's really incumbent upon the recommending officer to work with our collections policy staff on making sure that the statements are current.

10:04.833 --> 10:14.385
So those who think of their, in America or in the world, that there's always going to be a deposit copy

10:15.496 --> 10:18.861
at the Library of Proverbs, that's really not necessarily the case, is it?

10:19.462 --> 10:20.083
That's correct.

10:20.303 --> 10:28.575
I mean, if we selected something for our collections, we will keep it forever, unless... We will probably keep at least one copy forever.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.938
I explain situations like textbooks.

10:31.018 --> 10:33.902
We will not keep multiple copies of superseded editions.

10:34.082 --> 10:35.845
For one thing, we run out of shelf space.

10:36.746 --> 10:45.098
But for copyright material, if it just was deposited with the copyright, and we said, well, this is interesting, but not interesting enough to, you know...

10:45.314 --> 10:54.027
acquire, catalog, preserve, you know, da-da-da, then it's only kept in the copyright office for a certain period of time, and that's subject to their laws.

10:55.128 --> 11:15.118
I think when they're ready to unload a batch of material, it's offered again, or can be offered again, to the library to re-examine, to make sure that we're not missing an opportunity to add something back into our collections that was lost through the years, or borrowed and never returned, or

11:15.622 --> 11:16.523
Something like that.

11:17.224 --> 11:36.409
See, there's no way that you could make such determinations based on use the way many other libraries do, where they're trying to say, for instance, at some places, if a book's not used within five years, which is a preposterous figure, and you're seeing this now, by the way, that book's in trouble.

11:36.509 --> 11:45.240
And, you know, extremists maybe even, and we're in the chance at the very least of being sent off to an, if it's lucky, an off-site,

11:45.305 --> 11:45.726
Right.

11:45.946 --> 11:50.874
A storage facility, but also perhaps even going away.

11:51.054 --> 11:51.335
Right.

11:51.375 --> 12:01.331
But now you say having been selected for a collection, once the decision is made to keep a book, is that a decision forever?

12:01.731 --> 12:01.972
Mm-hmm.

12:02.673 --> 12:05.237
Or does somebody, do we have, or is it like parole?

12:05.277 --> 12:08.622
You know, you come up every five or ten years for another hearing.

12:09.263 --> 12:10.746
No, it's essentially forever.

12:10.886 --> 12:12.949
I mean, there might be instances where...

12:15.325 --> 12:30.882
We look again at the collections policy statement, which is the guiding principle for collecting in a particular area, and maybe decide, oh, we need to be more restrictive or we're duplicating what National Library of Medicine is doing or National Agriculture Library.

12:30.902 --> 12:44.657
There have been a couple of instances where we have decided not to collect maybe any more in an area or weed it back to maybe one set for a periodical as opposed to multiple sets.

12:45.380 --> 12:49.864
But those are the two areas that are obvious because there are other national libraries.

12:49.884 --> 12:50.945
Medicine, what was the other one?

12:50.965 --> 12:52.586
National Agriculture Library.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.847
And they're both here in Washington?

12:53.867 --> 12:54.268
Correct.

12:54.468 --> 12:57.971
One's in Beltsville, Maryland, and the other's in Bethesda.

12:58.711 --> 13:06.078
And they are the repositories for clinical medicine and technical agriculture.

13:06.598 --> 13:14.425
We have, you know, good collections in those areas, but we aren't the premier collections.

13:15.063 --> 13:18.848
I think your collection is pretty spectacular.

13:18.968 --> 13:19.529
Well, they are.

13:19.949 --> 13:27.059
I'm speaking of what's supposed to happen in terms of not duplicating what they have.

13:28.341 --> 13:34.969
Roughly, how many objects fall within your preview, would you say?

13:34.989 --> 13:35.430
Mine?

13:35.450 --> 13:35.650
Yeah.

13:36.892 --> 13:41.178
Probably close to 80 or 90 million.

13:41.218 --> 13:42.780
80 or 90 million.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.841
Right.

13:43.861 --> 13:44.462
There are...

13:45.438 --> 13:48.965
14 million items in the general collections.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.091
That's the bound book and periodical.

13:52.272 --> 13:53.534
That's here in Washington.

13:53.614 --> 13:54.676
Oh, yeah, that's here in Washington.

13:54.736 --> 13:55.718
All of this is here in Washington.

13:55.738 --> 13:57.722
Well, the 90 billion is not here in Washington.

13:57.742 --> 13:57.963
Sure.

13:58.023 --> 13:58.805
Really?

13:59.466 --> 14:01.229
Washington and Landover, Maryland.

14:01.249 --> 14:01.831
Landover, okay.

14:01.851 --> 14:04.055
I thought we were talking specifically about that.

14:04.075 --> 14:06.079
No, these three buildings...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.103
Yeah, it's probably three quarters of it is here.

14:10.143 --> 14:18.393
There are 111 million plus items in the whole of the library's collections, but that includes all of the photographs and manuscripts and everything else.

14:19.054 --> 14:19.255
Maps.

14:19.275 --> 14:19.375
Maps.

14:19.595 --> 14:21.698
But they're all under my administration.

14:21.758 --> 14:27.565
The only things that aren't are the collections in the law library.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.689
I don't know what their number count is.

14:31.050 --> 14:33.433
And anything...

14:34.510 --> 14:41.966
from, oh, vernacular languages in Asian and African and Middle East, because as I said, the area studies divisions report to someone else.

14:43.389 --> 14:46.716
I was out in San Francisco last weekend at the city library.

14:46.736 --> 14:54.612
I'm looking at national libraries totally apart from institutional libraries and public libraries.

14:54.828 --> 14:58.113
to some extent private libraries, which I've already done in my other book.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.496
Which I have, by the way.

15:00.777 --> 15:02.359
I yanked it from the stacks.

15:02.379 --> 15:02.759
Oh, good.

15:02.820 --> 15:03.440
Oh, there it is.

15:03.460 --> 15:04.582
So there it is, yes.

15:04.702 --> 15:06.525
You didn't see the wonderful dust jackets.

15:06.545 --> 15:08.668
No, we don't keep dust jackets.

15:08.688 --> 15:08.988
Really?

15:09.149 --> 15:09.389
No.

15:09.549 --> 15:10.451
Say that again.

15:10.491 --> 15:11.853
We don't keep dust jackets.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.635
I think that that's a mistake.

15:14.637 --> 15:19.063
That's part of the readable book called Paratexts, which has just been published.

15:19.381 --> 15:20.603
very interesting book.

15:20.623 --> 15:26.491
Well, there's just a whole history of social life and customs that you can get from the dust jackets.

15:27.753 --> 15:34.562
I think for a while the copyright office was retaining them, but I don't know that they still have them anymore.

15:34.622 --> 15:48.662
My knowledge of this goes back some years, but typically we remove the dust jacket and either have it library bound if we don't think that the binding it came with is sufficient enough to withstand use

15:49.165 --> 16:00.177
Or we do as we did with your book, accept the publisher's binding without the dust jacket and slap a label on it.

16:00.198 --> 16:02.720
Is there any way to indicate use on this?

16:02.740 --> 16:08.947
The circuit, yes, the loan division could track use on that.

16:08.967 --> 16:09.608
But there's nothing internal?

16:09.628 --> 16:14.334
No, there's nothing, like in public libraries where they have the stamps so you can see how many.

16:14.494 --> 16:17.417
Well, I did interview with Tilly Olsen, the writer, last week.

16:17.549 --> 16:22.275
And she had taken my book out of the library, and she said, look, it's children.

16:22.295 --> 16:24.278
You've been withdrawn 25 times.

16:24.298 --> 16:25.299
I was thrilled.

16:25.319 --> 16:25.900
You were thrilled.

16:26.100 --> 16:26.801
Exactly.

16:26.821 --> 16:30.185
I took a photograph of that card, you know.

16:30.285 --> 16:30.686
Yeah.

16:31.026 --> 16:33.890
We can determine use through our loan circulation records.

16:35.973 --> 16:36.734
And let's see.

16:37.975 --> 16:39.457
We probably kept two copies.

16:39.497 --> 16:44.884
I mean, this is copy one, so it doesn't say copy one, but probably we kept two copies.

16:46.727 --> 16:47.067
Right about that.

16:47.890 --> 16:49.592
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:50.313 --> 16:57.021
Well, I had someone go grab it for me as soon as we confirmed that we were going to chat.

16:58.783 --> 17:13.560
I guess certainly the preservation aspect, what, 111 million objects in the total collections, and you said 80 or 90 million under your supervision.

17:14.705 --> 17:19.352
no way all of these books are going to last forever or 100 years even.

17:20.454 --> 17:29.508
Can we talk about that and then how you went to this particular equation and if there's a program and an agenda and an overriding concern?

17:29.528 --> 17:35.637
I'd like to get into the brittle books and that concept of phase deterioration, which you call something else, I guess.

17:35.657 --> 17:38.041
Right, phase or plan deterioration.

17:39.904 --> 17:40.364
Same thing.

17:40.464 --> 17:43.429
Okay, well, I can start by saying that

17:43.628 --> 17:53.181
Yeah, we have a preservation program that has a binding component, a conservation component, and a reformatting component.

17:54.283 --> 18:00.531
And it's the mission of that program to preserve all of the library's collections.

18:01.553 --> 18:10.665
And that's a very broad statement, and it's intentionally so, because we feel we have an obligation to protect all of the library's collections,

18:10.915 --> 18:22.528
the solution, the means of protection will vary depending on the collection, the material, resources, even availability of certain kinds of solutions.

18:23.169 --> 18:35.623
So typically we employ a phrase that I think was originally associated with the Bauhaus movement in the 20s, but it's fitness for purpose.

18:35.738 --> 18:36.800
Fitness for Purpose.

18:36.840 --> 18:51.885
So we're looking at the solution that best meets the needs of the material, recognizing that we can't do a Rolls Royce treatment for every item in the library's collections.

18:52.867 --> 18:53.688
What time is it?

18:54.730 --> 18:55.471
It's 1.30.

18:55.491 --> 18:55.992
Okay.

18:56.012 --> 18:56.793
Two o'clock, please.

18:57.414 --> 18:58.877
Thanks.

18:59.618 --> 19:01.982
But that we can start by

19:02.722 --> 19:06.906
providing better temperature and humidity controls in the storage areas.

19:08.147 --> 19:25.482
We can teach care and handling techniques to all staff members who handle collections so that they're not inadvertently destroying something in the process of cataloging it or serving it in the reading room, that sort of thing.

19:26.844 --> 19:30.687
We have a conservation division that works

19:31.375 --> 19:37.583
mostly on special collections kinds of materials, manuscript material, top treasure material.

19:37.904 --> 19:44.392
By that I mean the George Washington Diaries or the rough draft of the Declaration of Independence.

19:44.553 --> 19:49.419
Those things are subjected to the highest level of conservation treatment.

19:49.439 --> 20:00.454
And then we have the binding program, which makes sure that all the books going into the collections are bound and in some way protect it.

20:01.210 --> 20:12.561
So we try to have, as I said, this continuum based on the needs and use this maxim of fitness for purpose.

20:14.343 --> 20:23.291
And each year we conduct an annual plan and we survey each of the divisions and talk to them about their top needs.

20:23.852 --> 20:30.238
And then we try to match their needs with how many resources we have available, either in-house

20:30.539 --> 20:36.467
or what we can contract out for and have people actually come in and do some work on collections.

20:36.807 --> 20:38.550
You mentioned fitness for purpose.

20:38.570 --> 20:44.217
So somebody then is going to make a judgment as to the value?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.719
Yeah.

20:45.799 --> 20:46.820
The content?

20:46.840 --> 20:47.081
Yes.

20:47.241 --> 20:48.382
It's a partnership.

20:48.442 --> 20:53.008
I mean, we work very closely with the curators and the subject specialists.

20:53.069 --> 20:57.034
So judgment's arbitrary, perhaps, even in some cases.

20:57.054 --> 20:58.015
Well, it's...

20:58.282 --> 21:13.185
It's arbitrary because it maybe depends on the subject knowledge of the person being consulted, but we typically think that the people who are working here in the Library of Congress are among the most knowledgeable and authoritative in their fields.

21:14.247 --> 21:20.937
So I think what we try not to do is have money drive the process.

21:20.957 --> 21:23.541
Well, we have $100,000, so how are we going to spend it?

21:23.561 --> 21:26.466
It's more based on what are the needs of the collections.

21:26.767 --> 21:29.550
So a couple of years ago, we took a survey.

21:29.590 --> 21:41.422
We just went around and talked to all of the divisions and had them start to suggest priorities for their preservation needs of their collections.

21:42.443 --> 21:44.045
We go to prints and photographs.

21:44.946 --> 21:47.388
What would you most like to see happen?

21:47.849 --> 21:51.032
Well, our poster collection really needs da-da-da-da-da-da.

21:51.533 --> 21:55.677
Our Alfred Wode Civil War drawings really need something.

21:55.825 --> 22:20.896
our daguerreotypes really need, you know, and begin to get kind of what I called at the time a snapshot of what was required and then start building five-year plans based on resources, staff resources, money, and time of the curators to spend working with us to preserve that collection.

22:20.916 --> 22:22.778
I mean, it isn't just us going in and

22:22.910 --> 22:27.576
doing what we need to do, but it's very much a partnership with each of the divisions.

22:28.577 --> 22:39.230
What is the state of the National Collection of Books?

22:40.011 --> 22:40.972
Are you keeping up with it?

22:41.072 --> 22:42.213
Are you losing the battle?

22:42.714 --> 22:49.542
I don't think we're losing the battle, but that program is at a crossroads because

22:50.551 --> 23:01.401
People are kind of waiting to see what kind of impact digital technology will have on keeping the artifact.

23:02.361 --> 23:08.167
To date, in the Library of Congress, we've had, since 1939, a microfilming program.

23:09.188 --> 23:19.917
So historically, when the hard copy, when its useful life was over, a decision was made to

23:20.167 --> 23:20.948
Or not to film it.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.431
Or not to film it, right.

23:27.034 --> 23:37.183
Or to acquire film of it, but in some way, you know, replacing it and reformatting it into another medium, most often microfilm.

23:39.365 --> 23:41.067
Certainly we do that with newspapers.

23:41.868 --> 23:47.213
We throw away our ink print newspapers after we film them, that's correct.

23:47.333 --> 23:49.735
We throw them away.

23:50.103 --> 23:59.957
or we purchase them in film, but we keep them, but so long, I think two years is current.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.000
That might be, yes.

24:02.320 --> 24:11.514
There should be a newspaper collections policy statement, and if it isn't, it would be online, because it was revised in the last two years.

24:12.315 --> 24:18.844
But ink print is not the preservation copy, microfilm is, and probably that will continue.

24:20.495 --> 24:23.098
Because we understand microfilm.

24:23.118 --> 24:24.239
We understand microfilm.

24:24.259 --> 24:24.660
It works.

24:24.740 --> 24:25.481
It's reliable.

24:25.621 --> 24:26.762
It's got longevity.

24:26.782 --> 24:28.424
And the time frame is pretty well understood.

24:28.604 --> 24:29.806
The time frame is understood.

24:29.866 --> 24:31.888
The standards are intact.

24:32.349 --> 24:33.950
And there are archival standards.

24:34.011 --> 24:35.472
There are archival standards.

24:35.592 --> 24:36.113
The U.S.

24:36.133 --> 24:44.823
newspaper program, which has been in existence for a number of years, and operated, coordinated at the Library of Congress by Robert Harriman.

24:46.705 --> 24:49.168
And it's an NEH-funded program.

24:49.655 --> 25:00.587
an attempt to sort of film the nation's newspapers, and there are projects I think going now in all 50 states.

25:02.449 --> 25:05.132
That's an area that I think you should definitely pick up on.

25:05.192 --> 25:06.273
Do it again?

25:06.293 --> 25:08.335
Yeah, it's called the U.S.

25:08.415 --> 25:09.417
Newspaper Project.

25:09.997 --> 25:10.758
Here at LC?

25:11.078 --> 25:13.381
Well, it's managed here at LC.

25:13.641 --> 25:17.285
I'm not mistaken, it's NDH funded.

25:17.966 --> 25:18.126
Okay.

25:18.629 --> 25:21.152
If you get a chance, you should really talk to Robert Harriman.

25:21.172 --> 25:23.014
Robert Harriman, is he here in this building?

25:23.034 --> 25:23.795
Yeah, he's here in this building.

25:23.815 --> 25:27.279
He works in serial records, but he's the program coordinator.

25:27.559 --> 25:30.082
I'll give you his telephone number.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.889
H-A-R-R-I-M-A-N.

25:35.929 --> 25:37.410
His phone number is 5946.

25:40.053 --> 25:43.397
And he's the coordinator of this program.

25:43.457 --> 25:46.881
And as I said, I think all 50 states are now participants.

25:46.901 --> 25:47.522
And he holds

25:48.110 --> 26:02.288
a meeting every spring, which kind of assesses how the program's going and has different people, representatives from the program come in and kind of talk about, you know, he likes to determine how we do it good, you know.

26:02.308 --> 26:11.820
And it's an opportunity for people to learn what's going on in the program in New York State or Iowa or what have you.

26:11.860 --> 26:14.804
And that's been going, I think it's been going for about 20 years.

26:14.864 --> 26:15.805
It was originally

26:16.308 --> 26:20.834
under the preservation program at some point, organizationally it was changed.

26:20.854 --> 26:29.226
And it being newspapers, it's like an offshoot category.

26:30.788 --> 26:38.358
So therefore, I guess, what's important then is preserving the information and not the artifact.

26:38.439 --> 26:40.221
That's definitely the case in newspapers.

26:40.241 --> 26:45.268
A decision has been made that the artifact, the value is really in the content and not

26:45.586 --> 26:46.867
That's right.

26:47.068 --> 26:47.588
That's right.

26:48.549 --> 26:51.252
And, you know, I have a couple of volumes up here.

26:55.556 --> 26:57.839
These are sort of the typical brittle books.

26:57.859 --> 26:58.619
Oh, wow, okay.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.502
Why don't you explain what we have here?

27:01.843 --> 27:04.986
Well, this is a serial called The Catholic Directory.

27:05.006 --> 27:08.830
It's 1900, and it's... In dreadful shape.

27:08.850 --> 27:13.635
Yeah, I mean, you could not do anything except reformat this.

27:13.987 --> 27:23.460
And I'm not even sure you can because the pages are so broken and splintered that even my touching it, I'm destroying it further.

27:23.820 --> 27:34.534
So we would probably try to borrow a volume from another library if we were interested in filming this whole set because not every volume has been charged.

27:34.614 --> 27:36.737
It means it's been removed from the collection.

27:37.257 --> 27:54.075
And if a reader happened to come in and say, oh, but I have to see the 1900 volume of the Catholic Directory because I'm doing genealogical research or whatever, then we would make it available to them under supervised conditions.

27:54.175 --> 28:05.847
But this was pulled from a bunch of trucks that I have down in the office that begins collating books and getting them ready to be filmed.

28:06.147 --> 28:08.150
I'll bet you that's a pretty well-used book.

28:08.170 --> 28:09.031
Well, it is.

28:09.051 --> 28:14.179
And, you know, this is not an atypical example for our directories' collection.

28:14.239 --> 28:15.902
That's a genealogical... Right.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.865
I mean, they love this stuff.

28:17.885 --> 28:22.312
I mean, we have a huge, huge, huge clientele in genealogists.

28:22.332 --> 28:23.634
We have a wonderful collection.

28:24.515 --> 28:28.722
And then this is not so bad, but it's pretty bad.

28:28.742 --> 28:29.964
This is a Russian text.

28:29.984 --> 28:31.126
This is a Russian text.

28:31.286 --> 28:32.087
It's...

28:33.130 --> 28:35.553
It's a government document.

28:35.774 --> 28:40.400
JX is the classification, and this could not be saved.

28:40.441 --> 28:44.647
Neither one of these volumes could be saved by deacidification technology.

28:45.428 --> 28:54.060
They have to be reformatted because it's just a matter of time before they are completely destroyed through use.

28:54.080 --> 29:03.053
Now, the challenge is how to create the program.

29:03.404 --> 29:14.995
You know, do you go and just kind of canvas the stacks looking for volumes like this and decide that you're going to film them, or do you think about use-driven?

29:15.015 --> 29:23.543
A patron comes in, they want to order something, you go and you retrieve it and you say, oh, God, this is really in bad shape, we really shouldn't let somebody use it.

29:24.724 --> 29:26.586
You know, let's film it and make it available.

29:26.646 --> 29:30.930
We don't really have a mechanism to kind of do filming on demand.

29:31.400 --> 29:36.367
It typically takes a number of weeks at best before something can be filmed.

29:37.047 --> 29:46.520
So if I come in and I ask for this book and somebody goes to fetch it... And said, ooh, gee, we really can't let you use it because it's a mess.

29:47.061 --> 29:52.608
And it's at that point also that you discover... Yes, that's right.

29:52.628 --> 29:56.774
But what if you were to arrive a year later and the thing is really gone?

29:56.814 --> 29:59.337
You have to find another copy of this book.

29:59.357 --> 30:00.158
That's not going to be...

30:00.222 --> 30:01.143
That's right.

30:01.243 --> 30:01.863
No, it isn't.

30:02.004 --> 30:04.045
I mean, our collections are peerless.

30:04.226 --> 30:12.913
And we have had some success in major microfilming projects and being able to fill in gaps in our collections.

30:12.933 --> 30:15.496
But it's very labor-intensive.

30:15.516 --> 30:18.378
It requires a lot of correspondence among institutions.

30:19.299 --> 30:27.947
And we just finished, in fact, a big microfilm project for a periodical called Carriage Monthly.

30:27.967 --> 30:29.588
It's on horse-drawn carriages, I think.

30:30.260 --> 30:36.867
And we had to borrow a lot of volumes and repair them and get them stable enough to be filmed.

30:38.709 --> 30:46.618
So it took us about a year to pull that project together to where we finally had actual film available of that collection.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.581
So it's those kinds of things.

30:49.281 --> 30:53.046
We're not geared up to do kind of the use-driven.

30:53.086 --> 30:54.828
It really has to be kind of planned.

30:54.848 --> 30:59.693
But it's hard to predict what would be, well, you can't predict what would be of value to researchers.

31:00.044 --> 31:02.968
So I'm not satisfied yet that we have the right handle.

31:03.488 --> 31:14.102
Now, do you have the capability, if you decide to copy that, to do that here, or is that something that you would outsource?

31:14.122 --> 31:15.824
No, we have the capability here.

31:15.884 --> 31:21.231
We have an in-house service that was established with Rockefeller Foundation money in 1939.

31:21.271 --> 31:25.917
The initial grant-slash-gift was

31:27.027 --> 31:30.550
to provide patrons copies of things from the library's collections.

31:31.411 --> 31:36.435
And it has become, over time, our in-house photo duplication service.

31:37.776 --> 31:44.883
So we film newspapers in-house, those that we don't otherwise acquire on film.

31:45.904 --> 31:51.749
And we do runs of serials, brittle books.

31:51.829 --> 31:54.171
We also film on demand.

31:54.291 --> 31:56.713
If a patron comes in and wants a copy of

31:57.082 --> 32:06.215
something that isn't otherwise restricted by copyright, you know, we would do that for a fee.

32:07.357 --> 32:09.720
I mean, there's a whole program dedicated to that.

32:10.641 --> 32:14.346
We also have photocopier machines in all of the reading rooms.

32:15.168 --> 32:21.857
So, you know, a patron goes and sort of flops the thing on.

32:22.664 --> 32:25.370
Do you have any problems with copyright people?

32:26.372 --> 32:28.697
No, because it's fair use.

32:29.740 --> 32:33.889
I mean, I assume that they're not copying whole books.

32:34.949 --> 32:38.353
And they supposedly know that they're not supposed to do that.

32:38.493 --> 32:45.100
Yeah, I think each machine has a sign that says, you know, a fair use copyright.

32:45.580 --> 32:46.221
Well, probably.

32:46.261 --> 32:48.964
I am concerned about the copyright.

32:49.044 --> 32:52.708
I am equally concerned about the wear and tear on the volumes.

32:53.108 --> 32:59.455
We've posted, we've made an investment in posting signage that we actually

33:00.312 --> 33:08.784
did through and outside graphic shopping, nice signs that are posted adjacent to photocopy areas, giving tips on the proper handling.

33:08.864 --> 33:11.788
But, you know, we don't police those areas.

33:11.809 --> 33:24.126
I mean, one, if somebody were to take that book and write it every page through a copy, that would really be, that would be a tough, quite an exercise for that book.

33:24.146 --> 33:25.408
That would easily account

33:25.895 --> 33:26.356
It would.

33:26.376 --> 33:28.639
The equivalent of any number of readings, I would say.

33:28.659 --> 33:29.740
No, it would.

33:29.880 --> 33:33.445
And, I mean, I think that typically they're not doing this kind of thing.

33:33.485 --> 33:35.948
They're finding the... The obscure thing.

33:36.228 --> 33:41.555
The obscure thing, the article in a bound periodical, an illustration in something.

33:42.116 --> 33:42.757
Yeah, yeah.

33:42.777 --> 33:43.618
Telephone books.

33:43.698 --> 33:44.439
Especially here, I think, at L.C.

33:44.459 --> 33:50.026
Yeah, telephone books get a lot of photo... I guess it's genealogists and skip tracers.

33:50.087 --> 33:53.171
A friend of mine used to be in the, quote, skip tracing business.

33:54.652 --> 33:55.714
Missing persons.

33:55.734 --> 33:55.834
Yeah.

33:56.050 --> 34:00.435
And directories are big sources of information for those.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.596
Do you keep all the telephones?

34:01.616 --> 34:02.497
We keep all of them.

34:02.517 --> 34:04.459
We do have a lot of them on film now.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.784
And there's something called telephone fiche that's available.

34:09.464 --> 34:13.148
For a number of years, we had a project to film all of our city directories.

34:14.930 --> 34:17.173
But, you know, it's labor-intensive.

34:17.273 --> 34:20.436
I mean, it's a page-by-page collation and examination.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.939
It's click, click, click, click, click.

34:22.959 --> 34:25.922
I think we've done about...

34:26.999 --> 34:45.225
oh, I can't think now, A, through something or other of our states, because we were doing all 50 states, but we started to target major cities, you know, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., because it's a huge local interest in that sort of thing.

34:45.245 --> 34:54.238
But, you know, that's an ongoing, we've been doing that for the last 10 years, filming our telephone directors, and then supplementing that filming with, we still get them in hardcopy,

34:54.472 --> 34:59.539
And then we subscribe to phone fish, which is available in the microform reading room.

35:00.481 --> 35:02.704
What are your limitations to preservation?

35:02.724 --> 35:04.747
Money, I suppose, and also equipment.

35:04.767 --> 35:09.053
Now, I mentioned to you that I'm going to Germany, going up to the Leipzig facility.

35:09.274 --> 35:09.554
Right.

35:09.574 --> 35:10.916
We have a splitting machine.

35:10.936 --> 35:12.158
Paper splitting machine, yes.

35:12.178 --> 35:18.307
And I guess this big deacidification thing where they can bring in, you know, pretty good-sized truckloads to the size of this table.

35:18.367 --> 35:18.647
Right.

35:18.928 --> 35:20.530
And they can do it in a mess.

35:20.594 --> 35:21.014
Right.

35:21.915 --> 35:28.482
I guess this reflects a commitment on the part of the government to try and preserve everything.

35:28.602 --> 35:29.063
That's right.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.525
We're not doing a similar thing here.

35:32.026 --> 35:38.432
Well, I'd say that the commitment is there, but we haven't quite figured out how many resources it would take to do it.

35:39.233 --> 35:44.719
So I think that's where issues of phased deterioration or planned deterioration come in.

35:44.779 --> 35:48.643
What we try to do here, though, is what I was explaining earlier.

35:49.822 --> 35:54.567
We feel that any response is at least a positive response.

35:55.068 --> 36:03.316
So even if we just make sure that the materials in the stack areas are kept under low temperature and humidity control, and we do that.

36:03.897 --> 36:13.087
I mean, we're constantly checking through uses of hydrothermographs the temperature and humidity of the stacks and making the adjustments accordingly.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.428
That was a huge thing.

36:14.780 --> 36:16.802
that we got going with the architect of the Capitol.

36:16.862 --> 36:18.344
I mean, we're tenants in these buildings.

36:18.384 --> 36:19.765
That's the other complication.

36:20.226 --> 36:25.872
The architect of the Capitol is the governing institution for the maintenance and upkeep of these buildings.

36:25.912 --> 36:26.673
That's correct.

36:27.534 --> 36:38.886
So if we want to keep stack level at, oh, 70 degrees Fahrenheit, 50 degrees relative humidity, we have to work through them to make sure that that's accomplished.

36:39.426 --> 36:39.907
You're tenants.

36:40.327 --> 36:40.688
Correct.

36:40.708 --> 36:41.248
We're tenants.

36:41.649 --> 36:43.711
And that's not a technicality.

36:43.811 --> 36:44.652
No, that's true.

36:45.087 --> 37:07.111
architect of the capital, they change the light bulbs, they maintain the elevators, they, you know, the plumbing, all of the facilities maintenance, the air conditioning, the lights, the temperature of the stacks, the humidity levels, everything is maintained by them.

37:07.171 --> 37:11.095
They have engineers around the clock available too.

37:11.952 --> 37:13.635
you know, manage the building.

37:13.775 --> 37:17.241
Kind of like the British Library up until it's moved now.

37:17.261 --> 37:20.666
They have been always tenants of the British Museum.

37:20.686 --> 37:20.987
Right.

37:21.107 --> 37:30.042
And they're really dealing for the first time of, you know, owning their own building, and it's really quite an exciting adventure for them.

37:30.062 --> 37:30.463
That's right.

37:31.244 --> 37:37.875
So we sort of look at the collection as, you know, some collections will get the high-level conservation treatment because they're

37:38.463 --> 37:40.546
their value merits it.

37:40.606 --> 37:49.197
And I named some kinds of examples, presidential papers, Lincoln's pockets the night he was assassinated, those kinds of things will get that high-level treatment.

37:50.779 --> 38:00.232
Something else, a Catholic directory, maybe it's not quite necessary to preserve the artifact, but preserving the content, so that's where we use the microfilming program.

38:00.292 --> 38:01.373
So that would be microfilmed?

38:01.393 --> 38:03.235
Do you think that would be scanned?

38:03.255 --> 38:04.437
I don't think we're

38:06.020 --> 38:06.841
It depends.

38:07.121 --> 38:12.926
If you just are looking for imaging and not searchable text, well, sure, you could scan it.

38:13.346 --> 38:18.391
But, I mean, the whole point of the directory is to be able to look up an entry.

38:18.771 --> 38:22.615
And I don't think we've quite come to grips yet with the kind of keying.

38:23.135 --> 38:31.262
Come on in.

38:31.302 --> 38:34.565
You can just be speaking to them at 9.30 tomorrow.

38:34.585 --> 38:35.706
I've set up an appointment.

38:35.838 --> 38:37.219
and I was going to get to that.

38:37.499 --> 38:47.328
But, you know, it's sort of like some will get this, and some will get that, and some will only get this, so that everybody gets a little something.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.150
That's our approach.

38:49.970 --> 38:56.436
And it's obviously overwhelming if you think, oh, God, 111 million items.

38:56.997 --> 39:01.220
But we just figure, well, we'll bite off a bit at a time, and we have a plan.

39:01.260 --> 39:02.521
You do have a plan.

39:02.682 --> 39:03.402
We do have a plan.

39:03.502 --> 39:04.343
I mean, we work...

39:05.133 --> 39:08.217
I mentioned a minute ago, we do have an annual plan.

39:08.257 --> 39:13.143
I mean, every year we look at our resources and we go to the divisions and we say, okay, what do you want done?

39:13.183 --> 39:18.809
And over and above that, we're aware of what's happening with all of the collections.

39:18.850 --> 39:21.633
I mean, you know, you kind of have to keep up.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.580
We're also looking and interested in what other libraries are doing.

39:28.606 --> 39:45.291
to look for opportunities for cooperative ventures, cooperative filming projects like the one for Carriage Monthly that I described, or cooperative scanning projects where we're building a virtual collection that everybody can benefit from.

39:45.351 --> 39:56.368
So it sort of depends, again, not just on the resources, but on the material type itself and the decision of a recommending officer and a curator is to sort of

39:57.648 --> 39:58.990
Is this worth it?

39:59.050 --> 40:01.393
Is this worth this level of response?

40:01.673 --> 40:06.400
Do you have an idea, again, a rough idea in numbers?

40:06.881 --> 40:12.268
How many books are at great risk?

40:12.989 --> 40:14.050
Yeah, we do.

40:14.090 --> 40:19.818
It's roughly 1% of 16 million.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.503
So that's 160,000.

40:24.952 --> 40:27.256
Not as nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

40:27.436 --> 40:29.820
Well, the at-risk means it's like this.

40:30.361 --> 40:30.721
Really?

40:30.741 --> 40:31.042
Oh, wow.

40:31.062 --> 40:31.282
Yeah.

40:31.803 --> 40:33.526
So at-risk means very bad.

40:34.628 --> 40:35.409
Well, let's—yeah.

40:35.429 --> 40:37.833
I mean, at-risk really should be a much greater number.

40:37.873 --> 40:41.278
Is at-risk actually beyond— This is what we call a basket case.

40:42.721 --> 40:51.094
I mean, this is—the only thing you can do is immediate aggressive intervention and

40:52.222 --> 41:00.933
As I said, in the case of this volume here, we would probably have to borrow it from another institution in order to preserve our content, because it's just too far away.

41:01.034 --> 41:06.361
But it would be impossible at this state even to go in and attempt deacidification or anything.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.362
Oh, absolutely.

41:07.382 --> 41:07.963
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

41:07.983 --> 41:09.365
There is a point of no return, right?

41:09.645 --> 41:13.470
Absolutely, and what we're trying to do now, deacidification, we finally

41:14.480 --> 41:16.363
Did you read the Wall Street Journal article?

41:16.383 --> 41:18.125
There was one a month or so ago.

41:18.145 --> 41:18.946
I did.

41:18.966 --> 41:19.327
Okay.

41:19.607 --> 41:20.869
Are you working with this fellow?

41:21.029 --> 41:22.151
Yeah, Dick Spass.

41:22.171 --> 41:24.574
Is that something worth my looking into?

41:24.694 --> 41:31.544
You know, talk, you're going to this afternoon talk with Ken Harris, who is the in-house, yeah, I did set up a program.

41:32.265 --> 41:38.514
And I should have probably started by saying, well, here's what we're going to do, but I never do that.

41:38.934 --> 41:40.757
Ken Harris will talk to you.

41:41.075 --> 41:49.766
The research chemist we have, Dr. Shahani, who was also I think quoted in the article, he's fractured his foot on the weekend, so I don't know whether he's in today or not.

41:49.826 --> 41:52.430
But Ken can talk about the history.

41:52.470 --> 42:01.041
This started at the Library of Congress deacidification technology, I think back in the 60s, where we developed a process called diethyl zinc.

42:01.308 --> 42:04.172
We patented it, and we were going to go forward.

42:04.192 --> 42:08.879
That was the Fort Detrick stuff, the blow-ups that you, I think, wrote about.

42:08.899 --> 42:10.241
He can talk to you about that.

42:10.301 --> 42:11.343
He wasn't here then, either.

42:11.363 --> 42:12.624
He was at the National Archives.

42:13.466 --> 42:15.669
It's not my intention to embarrass anybody here.

42:15.689 --> 42:16.570
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:16.590 --> 42:17.291
Oh, no, it's fine.

42:17.311 --> 42:21.738
I mean, I really think that— But repairing books can be hazardous to your health.

42:21.938 --> 42:23.881
Well, you know, it kind of can.

42:23.941 --> 42:25.443
It's not just an easy thing to do.

42:25.523 --> 42:30.150
I mean— We also spent twenty-some years in development of something.

42:30.383 --> 42:38.497
We were really careful about it, and there were some mistakes along the way and some to-ing and fro-ing, but we finally have a process.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.218
We're using it.

42:39.258 --> 42:41.843
We're sending real books off to be deacidified.

42:41.863 --> 42:43.185
What is the name of this process?

42:43.205 --> 42:48.915
It's called Bookkeeper, and it's a different kind of technology.

42:48.955 --> 42:52.421
The other one was gas vapor, and this is something else.

42:52.521 --> 42:53.783
The one that has a mishap.

42:54.063 --> 42:54.484
Correct.

42:55.595 --> 43:05.965
Deacidification was finally, I mean, Dazzle Zinc was finally perfected to where it could have been used on a mass level, but the company manufacturing it decided not to continue for business reasons.

43:05.985 --> 43:16.175
That was Axel Chemical, Texas Alkyl out in, I think Houston, but Ken can tell you.

43:17.616 --> 43:21.400
And Bookkeeper sort of

43:21.599 --> 43:31.330
came in unexpectedly with an alternative process, and I think what they're using in Germany is yet again different, and I'm sorry, I can't remember now which one it is.

43:32.471 --> 43:39.319
Ken knows all about the available deacidification technologies, what they're doing in the Netherlands, what they're doing in Germany.

43:39.359 --> 43:44.264
The Waito process, which was also a contender for a while.

43:45.005 --> 43:47.708
I've got a free day in the Netherlands next month.

43:48.008 --> 43:49.931
Are they in Amsterdam?

43:50.311 --> 43:53.977
Yeah, and they're pursuing... Maybe I'll go there.

43:54.037 --> 43:54.337
Yeah.

43:54.578 --> 44:02.710
Talk to Ken about what's happening in the Netherlands, because they had a number of scientists still interested in using the technology over there.

44:02.770 --> 44:06.575
The Swiss were fooling around with the process for a while.

44:06.635 --> 44:09.780
The bookkeeper seems to be working.

44:11.161 --> 44:22.715
We're in the process of renegotiating our contract with them, so I don't know where we are at the moment, because we have to be concerned about, you know, cost per item, obviously.

44:23.537 --> 44:26.480
What is your cost per item?

44:26.660 --> 44:28.082
I think it's ten to twelve dollars.

44:28.202 --> 44:29.644
Ken can tell you.

44:29.684 --> 44:30.926
It's not cheap.

44:30.946 --> 44:31.506
No, it isn't.

44:33.369 --> 44:36.713
And obviously you must have a fixed budget.

44:37.165 --> 44:38.126
We have a fixed budget.

44:38.167 --> 44:42.293
I mean, it's X number of million dollars at this point.

44:42.373 --> 44:43.394
It's no year money.

44:44.476 --> 45:00.641
But it was a long time in development, and it's only been in the last year and a half that we've actually begun deacidifying our collections as opposed to continually testing with test books or surplused material, that sort of thing.

45:00.761 --> 45:04.667
So it's a pretty big deal, and we've been working on developing selection criteria.

45:04.687 --> 45:05.468
Okay, you've got

45:06.089 --> 45:09.314
You've got 14 million items in all of these subject areas.

45:09.354 --> 45:10.916
What are you going to go after first?

45:10.936 --> 45:17.366
The Librarian of Congress is certainly very interested in using the technology on the most important and most critical.

45:18.568 --> 45:34.172
That's hard to define, but we have decided at least to begin with American material, and by American we mean American history, American social life and customs, political science,

45:34.844 --> 45:36.005
legal materials.

45:37.127 --> 45:43.355
We're experimenting currently with some Pulp Fiction paperback material, which I love.

45:43.916 --> 45:45.297
I'm interested in that sort of thing.

45:46.499 --> 45:49.963
And kind of developing some criteria.

45:50.244 --> 45:54.529
The same way we would look at Civil War drawings.

45:54.870 --> 45:56.532
What's the cost of doing it?

45:56.552 --> 45:57.873
What's the cost of not doing it?

45:57.913 --> 45:59.075
That kind of analysis.

45:59.736 --> 46:01.538
So that we're making decisions.

46:01.878 --> 46:04.682
Even if you make a decision not to, you're making a decision.

46:05.017 --> 46:13.089
I want it to be that if we don't do something, it's a decision not to do it, because we've chosen to preserve something else more aggressively.

46:15.352 --> 46:30.455
It's a constant cycle of kind of looking at it and reexamining it and being aware of what other solutions might come along that would provide a better, more powerful response than the one we're using.

46:31.476 --> 46:34.180
The library's commitment is to printed books?

46:34.717 --> 46:52.182
Yes, although the library is very interested in digital technology and up to this point has been interested in digital technology as an access medium, principally for American materials in the special collections, manuscripts, photographs, maps, those kinds of things.

46:52.242 --> 47:03.778
We've done some printed book material on an experimental basis, but really with the digital technology it's been more special collections

47:04.231 --> 47:13.125
for access purposes, but I see down the road digitizing for preservation purposes so that we don't have to do double handling.

47:13.285 --> 47:13.926
I do, yeah.

47:14.126 --> 47:15.368
And they're working on that here?

47:15.929 --> 47:18.934
I think we are not the only ones working on it.

47:18.954 --> 47:20.356
Well, Cornell, of course.

47:20.376 --> 47:28.048
Well, in fact, we're about to do a project with them after October 1, our new fiscal year.

47:28.729 --> 47:32.415
We are pursuing a joint endeavor to look at

47:32.682 --> 47:39.872
19th century book material and look at their strategies for preserving slash digitizing versus ours.

47:39.972 --> 47:45.099
And I think moving toward a matrix and decision tools that people can use.

47:45.160 --> 47:51.008
Well, if you have this material type, you should scan at this level, you know, with this kind of equipment and that sort of thing.

47:51.188 --> 47:54.032
So we're doing an R&D project with them.

47:54.248 --> 47:57.732
I mean, I spent two days up there, and that's a year ago.

47:57.772 --> 47:59.634
I mean, God only knows what they've done.

48:00.014 --> 48:03.078
Yeah, I mean, they were out in front of everybody.

48:03.138 --> 48:04.179
You know, she's terrific.

48:04.259 --> 48:05.000
She's unbelievable.

48:05.020 --> 48:05.881
Yeah, she's great.

48:06.061 --> 48:07.262
She has an answer for everything.

48:07.362 --> 48:11.707
And I mean this in a very admirable way.

48:11.727 --> 48:12.468
No, she's good.

48:12.508 --> 48:22.078
I've worked with her on a couple of other, you know, committees in the field, and so we're doing this project with her and her staff.

48:22.480 --> 48:26.886
We're also interested in the whole area of digitizing of audio collections.

48:26.926 --> 48:28.388
We've been doing a lot of work there.

48:28.408 --> 48:33.174
But to get back to your original question, yes, we are still interested in the printed text.

48:36.178 --> 48:44.009
We're also interested in exploring other preservation technologies, and we consider digital technology among them.

48:44.550 --> 48:50.237
Yeah, something Dr. Billington pointed out in an interview with him last year when I was here.

48:50.738 --> 48:51.559
This is still

48:52.349 --> 49:00.321
Well, the British Library does collect the world, too, but, you know, this institution does actively collect the world.

49:00.521 --> 49:01.583
Yes, it does.

49:01.603 --> 49:09.254
120 countries, you actually have people out there, agents, you know, scouring for material.

49:09.274 --> 49:09.634
Yes, we do.

49:09.655 --> 49:13.300
And, you know, that is unique, I think.

49:13.720 --> 49:17.546
The British Library does similar things, but not on a scale.

49:17.807 --> 49:20.871
I've been to the French Library, and their focus is

49:21.323 --> 49:23.407
is France, as well it should be.

49:23.487 --> 49:26.753
But I think that point is worth repeating.

49:26.773 --> 49:36.311
It's not just preserving American culture and the American heritage, et cetera, et cetera.

49:36.331 --> 49:39.197
No, it's also the influence on the American experience.

49:39.277 --> 49:41.982
I think that that really was crystallized

49:42.653 --> 49:50.380
under the leadership of Archibald MacLeish, who was Librarian of Congress from, oh God, 1939 to 1943 or something like that.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.842
He's going to have a permanent role in my book.

49:52.902 --> 49:54.083
Well, he was phenomenal.

49:54.203 --> 50:08.896
I mean, and much of the foundation on which the Library of Congress rests, you know, the Library of Congress in mid-century forward, is based on his ideas and principles and precepts.

50:08.957 --> 50:10.618
I mean, he's a remarkable person.

50:11.172 --> 50:20.783
But certainly, one of his areas of interest was the international collecting and how important that was to, you know, understanding ourselves through understanding others.

50:20.923 --> 50:28.471
So, I mean, the Hispanic Foundation, which became the Hispanic Division, was established under him.

50:31.174 --> 50:32.516
I'll come get you.

50:32.536 --> 50:35.419
Want to just sit with Ted?

50:38.643 --> 50:38.783
Okay.

50:39.387 --> 50:42.311
Maybe two-thirds of our collections are foreign language materials.

50:42.771 --> 50:47.677
I mean, it's a huge, huge percentage, and we're still actively collecting.

50:47.697 --> 50:52.303
We have overseas offices in Cairo and the Far East and Delhi.

50:52.323 --> 50:55.306
You actually have agents over there, and you do swaps with people.

50:55.326 --> 50:56.067
We do swaps.

50:56.107 --> 51:07.521
We have overseas microfilming programs so that we can bring the material here in microfilm already so that we're not dealing with certain kinds of poor paper and that sort of thing.

51:07.906 --> 51:19.501
The one area that I haven't been able to have something resolve for me is, you know, how can you guarantee the migration of digitized material?

51:19.521 --> 51:26.429
I mean, we know microfilm, we know paper, but we really don't know.

51:26.449 --> 51:29.333
And the fellow at the French Library told me it does deteriorate.

51:29.613 --> 51:29.814
Right.

51:29.934 --> 51:30.495
No, it does.

51:30.635 --> 51:35.601
And Carl, when you meet with him tomorrow, Carl Fleischauer, can talk to you a little bit about

51:36.458 --> 51:43.071
what the library is envisioning in terms of storage and migration and data refreshing and all that sort of thing.

51:43.873 --> 51:48.723
I mean, it's a whole other critical part of the puzzle.

51:49.164 --> 51:50.546
And the scanning is the easy part.

51:52.110 --> 51:55.817
The scanning and the describing is the easy fun part.

51:56.219 --> 52:00.945
maintaining it and storing it and being able to retrieve it five years from now.

52:01.286 --> 52:01.927
That's the challenge.

52:01.947 --> 52:06.232
Well, there I was at Cornell, and they were saying, well, that's what I said.

52:06.533 --> 52:07.574
It's zeros and ones.

52:07.794 --> 52:09.076
Everything is zeros and ones.

52:09.156 --> 52:10.157
That doesn't change.

52:10.778 --> 52:13.121
However, you know, the systems might change.

52:14.183 --> 52:16.285
And I said, you know, that's very interesting.

52:16.305 --> 52:21.332
But I'll bet right here as we speak on this campus there are thousands of perforated cards

52:21.700 --> 52:32.779
that nobody has a clue as to what's in them and how to see what's on them, because nobody ever bothered to make sure that the migration... That's right.

52:33.340 --> 52:42.916
Are you familiar with a report that the then-named Commission on Preservation and Access and the Research Library Groups produced on that topic?

52:43.257 --> 52:43.557
No.

52:43.677 --> 52:45.801
They had a task force two years ago

52:46.321 --> 52:47.783
Oh, I think I saw something.

52:47.883 --> 52:49.545
The archiving of digital information.

52:49.565 --> 52:50.426
Yeah, yeah.

52:50.447 --> 52:53.350
That's a useful report to get a hold of.

52:53.390 --> 52:57.196
If you call the commission, I'm sure they would give you one.

52:57.316 --> 52:58.938
I have one here.

52:59.118 --> 52:59.719
It's a commission?

53:00.180 --> 53:11.034
Commission on Preservation and Access has just renamed itself to the Council on Library and Information Resources.

53:11.174 --> 53:11.835
Council?

53:12.276 --> 53:13.257
Yeah, I'll give you one.

53:14.671 --> 53:20.058
Do you remember the Council on Libraries?

53:20.719 --> 53:23.963
It's been around for a while.

53:24.664 --> 53:37.381
It spun off a preservation program about ten years ago called the Commission on Preservation and Asset.

53:37.401 --> 53:39.163
And then last year to leverage.

53:40.185 --> 53:42.788
So she's the president.

53:43.460 --> 53:47.928
a provisional report on the internet, which I just found scanning one.

53:47.948 --> 53:50.112
I copied it out, but I don't think it was the final one.

53:50.172 --> 53:50.613
Yeah, this is it.

53:50.633 --> 53:51.395
I just have it now.

53:51.415 --> 53:51.916
Oh, you've got it.

53:53.539 --> 53:56.164
I'm so glad they asked me to come down and sign.

53:56.204 --> 53:57.125
I can have it?

53:57.145 --> 53:59.410
Yes.

54:01.373 --> 54:01.974
This is great.

54:02.756 --> 54:04.339
I will cite all this stuff.

54:04.359 --> 54:06.042
If you look at General Madness,

54:06.916 --> 54:09.219
I put it all in there, all on the record.

54:09.279 --> 54:11.441
I like to think that it's a resource.

54:12.903 --> 54:22.595
Well, it is a resource, and she's just a good person to be aware of because her organization thinks about this issue a lot.

54:23.075 --> 54:33.868
And she provides program support to all libraries, either through her publications programs or getting grants.

54:34.203 --> 54:37.669
to support actual digitizing of collections.

54:38.711 --> 54:48.069
She's also, though, supportive of sort of the more traditional preservation activities, and she's just a person that you should be aware of.

54:48.109 --> 54:49.251
I think so.

54:49.792 --> 54:50.473
Yeah, excellent.

54:50.791 --> 54:52.774
for email addresses here, too.

54:52.794 --> 54:53.475
That's good.

54:53.495 --> 54:55.297
You've got a thing coming up at 2.

54:55.317 --> 54:57.100
Well, actually, I was... Yes, I do.

54:57.240 --> 55:05.932
And what I was going to do is turn you over to my assistant for preservation so that you could spend the afternoon talking to Mr. Harris and seeing the Rare Book Lab.

55:06.232 --> 55:07.274
Okay, Harris?

55:07.294 --> 55:07.894
Ken Harris.

55:07.935 --> 55:09.336
He's for deacidification.

55:09.857 --> 55:10.598
Okay.

55:10.618 --> 55:15.885
If Dr. Shahani is in, then I'm sure that he'll... Dr. S?

55:15.905 --> 55:16.406
Chandru.

55:16.687 --> 55:19.971
C-H-A-N-D-R-U...

55:20.423 --> 55:24.728
Shahani, S-H-A-H-A-N-I.

55:27.231 --> 55:28.312
His specialty is?

55:28.332 --> 55:30.174
His specialty, he's a research chemist.

55:30.414 --> 55:30.795
Okay.

55:30.875 --> 55:38.083
And his specialty is paper chemistry and solutions for deterioration.

55:38.243 --> 55:38.904
Okay, excellent.

55:39.044 --> 55:47.494
His career began, well, when it began, but he was at the National Archives and he came here probably fifteen years ago and was very instrumental in

55:48.588 --> 55:51.312
bringing the bookkeeper endeavor to life.

55:52.333 --> 55:56.078
And that's your program or that's something that was developed out there?

55:56.098 --> 55:56.659
That's Mr. Spatz's.

55:56.739 --> 55:58.120
Yeah, that's Mr. Spatz's process.

55:58.141 --> 56:00.103
Oh, that's the fellow that was in the process.

56:00.143 --> 56:02.086
Yeah, he's the CEO.

56:02.246 --> 56:03.007
Right.

56:03.447 --> 56:04.068
I can't remember.

56:04.349 --> 56:05.450
He's a caricature.

56:05.831 --> 56:07.072
He's in Ohio, I think.

56:07.092 --> 56:08.134
No, Pennsylvania.

56:08.234 --> 56:09.055
Grandvary Heights.

56:10.457 --> 56:11.698
Somewhere outside of Pittsburgh.

56:12.299 --> 56:13.060
I'm trying to go see him.

56:13.192 --> 56:16.295
Okay, this is so serendipitous what I'm doing.

56:16.455 --> 56:17.757
It sounds interesting to me.

56:17.777 --> 56:21.200
Well, Ken can certainly give you some insight into that.

56:22.521 --> 56:29.008
So I thought you could also look at the Rare Book Conservation Lab and talk with some conservators down there.

56:29.108 --> 56:33.032
And you mentioned something about the National Digital Library.

56:33.052 --> 56:33.172
Right.

56:33.192 --> 56:39.098
Tomorrow morning at 9.30, if you'll come back here, Carl's Life Shower,

56:39.550 --> 56:43.317
is going to greet you here, and then you go off with him.

56:43.577 --> 56:47.684
S-L-E-I-S-H-A-U-R.

56:47.704 --> 56:50.369
I think there's a C in there someplace.

56:50.449 --> 56:52.012
I'll get this card.

56:52.032 --> 56:52.233
So I know.

56:52.493 --> 57:00.968
And then after that, and this is up to you, if you want to also hear about what we're doing with collection security and

57:01.302 --> 57:03.004
off-site storage planning.

57:03.104 --> 57:03.805
Oh, absolutely.

57:03.845 --> 57:08.130
I've arranged for a meeting at 11 with the manager of that project.

57:08.150 --> 57:08.710
That would be great.

57:08.991 --> 57:11.553
Okay, so I thought... I don't have to be downtown until 1.

57:11.573 --> 57:21.845
Okay, so I thought what could happen is Carl could bring you back up to this suite at 11, and then Steve Herman could come get you, and you could go off and see the stacks and all that kind of junk.

57:21.865 --> 57:22.245
That's great.

57:22.506 --> 57:24.608
Okay, well, I hope it's, you know, what you're after.

57:24.628 --> 57:25.469
This is what I'm doing.

57:25.509 --> 57:30.955
I'm sorry, we're talking about... When we pull off superseded editions, for example, and you think, well...

57:31.559 --> 57:45.199
There was one case I'm aware of where it was a literary anthology that had been published over a number of years, and we were pulling off the superseded editions, keeping only one copy.

57:45.620 --> 57:51.328
And then we had the recommending officer for that area come and look at it to make sure that that's okay.

57:51.589 --> 57:58.579
And he made the decision to keep two copies of one of the superseded editions because the preface had been written by

57:58.795 --> 58:02.719
a very important person in the field of American letters at that time.

58:03.399 --> 58:08.084
So I wouldn't have known that, and the person doing the work wouldn't have known it, but the subject specialist did.

58:08.104 --> 58:13.329
So you have to have that collaboration in order to make the kind of informed decision.

58:13.429 --> 58:15.812
So Steve can tell you a lot about the inventory.

58:17.313 --> 58:20.136
Steve Herman is the 11 o'clock appointment.

58:20.576 --> 58:27.503
So this afternoon it's Ken and Chandru if he's hobbled in because he fractured his foot, and the Rare Book Lab.

58:28.057 --> 58:31.824
And then tomorrow it's Carl and Steve.

58:33.267 --> 58:34.309
But you would meet again up here.

58:34.329 --> 58:37.736
And then if you have a second, I wanted to show you the selection office.

58:38.778 --> 58:40.301
Okay, this is the selection office.

58:40.321 --> 58:43.206
Yes, this is like copyright deposit material.

58:43.948 --> 58:47.915
These are little bathtub books that kids take into the... Bathtub books, right.

58:47.976 --> 58:50.120
And it was published with a copyright notice.

58:50.140 --> 58:50.841
One with a flashlight, yep.

58:51.158 --> 58:54.642
So you have Mickey Mouse, knife and fork and book set.

58:54.762 --> 58:55.663
Pop-up books.

58:55.784 --> 58:58.787
You have a little flashlight here and a book.

58:58.807 --> 58:59.949
You have a puzzle book.

59:02.392 --> 59:05.515
Here's a rubber stamp plus book.

59:06.657 --> 59:10.041
These are all things that come in under copyright deposit.

59:10.061 --> 59:14.726
And then we figure out whether we're going to import a collection.

59:14.746 --> 59:16.729
The selection room.

59:16.749 --> 59:16.929
Right.

59:17.169 --> 59:17.790
Kind of a...

59:18.867 --> 59:22.410
A euphemism, isn't it, for where life and death decisions are made?

59:22.550 --> 59:23.812
In some respects, yeah.

59:24.332 --> 59:26.935
And she's got this great collection of pop-up books.

59:26.955 --> 59:27.575
And they're great.

59:27.695 --> 59:32.520
They're probably not going to stay in the collection, but so I don't want to keep them because they're so nice.

59:32.580 --> 59:32.880
Right, exactly.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.823
And look, actually, you'd be amazed at how collectible some of these things are.

59:35.843 --> 59:36.924
Oh, I know, I know.

59:36.944 --> 59:40.847
I try not to think about it because then I'll want to start collecting it myself.

59:40.867 --> 59:42.569
Yeah, I mean, there's a fear here.

59:42.749 --> 59:43.290
And look at this.

59:43.610 --> 59:45.752
So these are things that people are culling.

59:46.306 --> 59:46.687
Right.

59:46.707 --> 59:48.830
What's amazing is the variety of things.

59:48.890 --> 59:50.973
You're never going to see anything like this in Widener.

59:51.353 --> 59:51.934
Oh, no.

59:52.135 --> 59:53.677
Oh, no.

59:54.378 --> 01:00:00.527
You know, foreign publications, periodicals, children's books, games, all the stories.

01:00:00.547 --> 01:00:02.950
Reports, children's books.

01:00:03.852 --> 01:00:14.187
You know, and look, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

01:00:14.521 --> 01:00:16.643
Is Lolita around?

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:20.568
Could you grab her, please?

01:00:20.588 --> 01:00:26.996
If you want to talk to her for about five minutes, she is a wealth of information.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:32.462
She's been here since, I think, 1966, and she knows everything there is to know about selection.

01:00:33.523 --> 01:00:34.304
Hi.

01:00:34.324 --> 01:00:35.866
This is Nicholas Bazbanes.

01:00:35.906 --> 01:00:37.988
He wrote A Gentle Madness.

01:00:38.088 --> 01:00:41.933
You probably read it, you know, being a bibliophile and all that.

01:00:42.894 --> 01:00:43.735
But anyway.

01:00:43.917 --> 01:00:46.600
I can't tell you anymore.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:55.108
He's doing kind of a companion volume, and I was going on and on and on about the selection office, but I don't know anything about it compared to what you know about it.

01:00:56.169 --> 01:00:57.871
Well, we're on the way out.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.354
We're being reorganized as of Monday.

01:01:00.734 --> 01:01:02.836
Well, not your function, maybe just your name.

01:01:03.737 --> 01:01:07.821
Well, we're only going to be doing scripts and copywriting.

01:01:07.841 --> 01:01:09.823
Oh, well, you can explain all the nuances.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.172
But he saw the book, So You Want to Be a Librarian, that I removed from your truck.

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:18.280
Because I still intend to take photographs of it.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:25.036
And so that got us off into the whole thing of collecting and selecting and all that.

01:01:25.136 --> 01:01:27.762
So I thought the best person really to talk to would be you.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.605
So if you've got five minutes, because he's supposed to go down to preservation.

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:31.806
Oh, good.

01:01:31.826 --> 01:01:32.326
Five minutes.

01:01:32.366 --> 01:01:33.828
Really five minutes.

01:01:33.949 --> 01:01:35.891
And I'll go see that gentleman you just introduced to.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:40.578
Yes, actually, I'm going to bring Meryl Lee back here, and she can hover in the doorway.

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:41.039
Okay, good.

01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:43.422
And this was mine, too, so I won't be taking something else.

01:01:43.442 --> 01:01:44.824
Yeah, I gave him my copy.

01:01:45.024 --> 01:01:45.665
Okay, good.

01:01:45.685 --> 01:01:45.885
All right.

01:01:45.905 --> 01:01:46.827
But online, yeah.

01:01:46.847 --> 01:01:46.947
Okay.

01:01:47.508 --> 01:01:47.708
All right.

01:01:48.278 --> 01:01:49.260
They are online.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:49.741
Okay.

01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:50.241
Thank you so much.

01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:51.524
Well, I'm going to bring my sister in there.

01:01:51.544 --> 01:01:53.467
She'll hover in the doorway and then take you down.

01:01:53.487 --> 01:01:54.569
I hope I see you before.

01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:59.317
Yes, well, I'll see you at 9.30 in the morning because you'll come and see me and I'll hand you off tomorrow.

01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:00.199
All right.

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:01.962
Thanks very much.

01:02:02.002 --> 01:02:03.064
I enjoyed it.

01:02:03.244 --> 01:02:03.705
I'm just going to.
