WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:06.275
talking to Barkley Ogden, and you were just telling me the hats that you wear.

00:06.335 --> 00:29.498
Yeah, the head of the conservation department for the library at Berkeley, the head of the digital library R&D department, again, for the projects that the library has, that in digital library development, and then, sorry, and then there, that for the nine campuses of the university, I serve as director of the

00:29.849 --> 00:34.453
Well, both of these are of interest to me, as it turns out.

00:35.754 --> 00:40.238
Mr. Ogden are involved in the present.

00:40.759 --> 00:43.521
Well, in the present and the future, I guess.

00:43.762 --> 00:44.863
Is that a fair assessment?

00:44.883 --> 00:49.727
Well, we certainly are trying to anticipate the future.

00:49.747 --> 00:54.771
And in terms of, why don't we start with the digital library hat?

00:55.552 --> 00:59.856
Tell me what specifically you're doing there.

01:00.106 --> 01:29.623
it's probably worth providing just a little context so that you have a sense of why I'm doing what I'm doing as well as what I'm doing that the the advent of the availability of information online that has brought with it some promises and prospects and some liabilities that the promise it has is

01:30.025 --> 01:41.561
to be able to allow information to go from creator to consumer much more rapidly, I think, when it was available through other media.

01:42.222 --> 01:55.780
The prospects for whole new industries that are involved in information creation and distribution are quite amazing.

01:56.587 --> 02:10.848
Anytime you pick up a copy of the San Francisco Chronicle and look at the business section, it seems to talk about nothing but Silicon Valley and the various enterprises that are associated with information creation and delivery.

02:11.048 --> 02:25.750
And then finally, the liabilities that are inherent in all of this, and we're just beginning to see them using the World Wide Web as a prime example, is that there's no organization or filtering of good from bad in this stuff.

02:26.219 --> 02:32.227
There are a couple of ways, intellectually, that one could approach this particular problem.

02:32.688 --> 02:47.068
The first of which might be to write a piece of software that you could use as your own personal bibliographic assistant that would be able to, as your research assistant, sort out what you really needed to read from what you really didn't need to read.

02:48.330 --> 02:53.998
But our luck with the design of those kinds of retrieval mechanisms

02:54.417 --> 02:56.299
that is pretty slim thus far.

02:59.703 --> 03:10.616
We just don't do all that well because we're not able to either describe the object as precisely as one would want or to describe our needs as precisely as we would want.

03:11.137 --> 03:23.091
So you put those two fuzzy sets together and then all of a sudden you really need to have a much more sophisticated interface, if you will, between your information needs and the world of information.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.752
Where has that been done historically?

03:25.613 --> 03:26.113
The library.

03:26.654 --> 03:47.660
That's the value that the library adds, that in addition to having the information itself as a repository, what they provide is the ability to filter that information, to sort out what's good from bad, and to organize it in a way that you can retrieve it with less time than it took somebody to organize it in the first place.

03:48.021 --> 03:52.386
Which is pretty much what you're up to on the web, that you become your own librarian.

03:52.973 --> 04:17.850
So the idea of our doing digital library research and development projects is to try to take the expertise that we have developed in research libraries over as much time as you and your research have discovered and has been spent at this kind of activity and bring that to a new medium, which is to say the electronic medium.

04:19.412 --> 04:21.816
And there are some tremendous similarities.

04:22.336 --> 04:33.170
between the kind of work we've done for paper and film and other kinds of analog media that also show up in the digital medium.

04:33.671 --> 04:43.163
Because in many ways, the documents we create in the digital medium are fundamentally no different than the documents we create in the paper.

04:43.583 --> 04:48.850
We talk about an information revolution, but the information itself has not changed.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.604
It's still structured the same way in terms of the kinds of documents.

04:52.624 --> 04:53.685
We still create memos.

04:53.705 --> 04:54.686
We still create letters.

04:54.746 --> 04:55.788
We still create books.

04:55.868 --> 04:57.530
We still do all of those sorts of things.

04:57.910 --> 05:05.319
We may publish them and distribute them in electronic form, but we don't create a fundamentally different kind of organization of information.

05:06.881 --> 05:16.052
What is a revolution that is the revolution in communications technology, there's where we're seeing the revolution.

05:16.589 --> 05:24.839
And I think that, in some ways, the information revolution is a bit of a misnomer, because information is not really fundamentally changing.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.882
It's not its structure.

05:26.902 --> 05:28.524
It's the way we deliver it that's changing.

05:29.885 --> 05:44.824
Now, one could argue, I think, quite effectively, that there probably are examples where the medium has actually changed the message, to borrow that famous phrase.

05:45.260 --> 05:52.969
I think that if you look at most of what you'll find on the web, you could find exactly the same kind of information structure on paper.

05:54.852 --> 05:57.875
Even like interactive websites.

05:57.915 --> 06:00.679
We think they're pretty exciting, and I think they are pretty exciting.

06:01.199 --> 06:08.588
But the truth of the matter is, all you have to do is take a look at a program learning text, and you've got the same fundamental organization of information.

06:10.971 --> 06:15.216
You know, it asks you a question at point A, and if you answer with a yes, it takes you down one

06:15.989 --> 06:20.213
one leg of the why, and if you answer no, it takes you down another one.

06:20.253 --> 06:21.474
It says jump to page 62.

06:24.097 --> 06:45.878
So I think that if we focus, at least for the short term, on the impact of the communications revolution, I think we'll understand a little better what libraries have to bring to this new environment, and what they have to bring because the information structure itself hasn't changed.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.046
that is an ability to sort and to organize, to filter and to organize.

06:51.466 --> 07:02.038
It is kind of interesting that you, on the surface, this would be an odd juxtaposition for preservation of the existing materials.

07:03.761 --> 07:04.702
It would seem so.

07:04.722 --> 07:15.274
The link that is often made is that in the past, in order to do preservation, we have

07:15.558 --> 07:21.125
extreme difficulties when the service life of the medium is at its end.

07:21.986 --> 07:25.590
So that when paper becomes brittle, we can't repair it.

07:27.332 --> 07:34.861
When film starts shedding its image or its emulsion layer off the base, we can't repair that.

07:35.421 --> 07:41.869
What we have to do is what we call in the trade reformatting that.

07:42.170 --> 07:46.134
You know, we use photocopying.

07:46.154 --> 07:47.316
We use microfilming.

07:47.756 --> 07:57.146
And those are all reformatting techniques that have been used in order to preserve the intellectual content by transferring it from medium to medium.

07:57.166 --> 08:12.042
Well, one of the initial thoughts, which is what brings these two ideas, these two responsibilities together in at least some people's minds, is that preservation probably could use the electronic medium as another tool in order to preserve.

08:12.359 --> 08:18.125
We would, again, capture the image, but not in film or on paper.

08:18.225 --> 08:19.306
We would capture it electronically.

08:19.326 --> 08:20.867
What we are preserving is the content.

08:21.308 --> 08:21.708
That's right.

08:21.828 --> 08:23.750
You're preserving the content, not the artifact.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.892
And shedding the artifact, so to speak?

08:26.233 --> 08:26.513
Indeed.

08:26.773 --> 08:27.013
Indeed.

08:27.053 --> 08:27.994
That happens every time.

08:28.014 --> 08:34.641
If you make a photocopy of something because the original is no longer usable, you shed the artifact.

08:34.961 --> 08:35.922
Same with the microfilm.

08:36.463 --> 08:36.863
Of course.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.546
Now, are you involved in digitizing any printed books?

08:40.086 --> 08:41.067
We are.

08:41.468 --> 08:44.973
But Clara has a very elaborate program.

08:45.914 --> 08:46.375
Absolutely.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.838
They're way out ahead of us on that particular front.

08:49.278 --> 08:54.305
We are not, at this point, using digitization as a preservation tool.

08:55.126 --> 09:01.735
And the reason for that is because we are not yet happy with its stability.

09:03.718 --> 09:06.902
And maybe you could just define the various matters.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.188
the factors that go into stability.

09:09.208 --> 09:19.958
We're talking about migration, we're talking about systems, we're talking about doing it, saving it in one format today that five years from now there isn't a machine that can access it.

09:20.378 --> 09:26.263
They say, you're not using digitization today as a preservation tool.

09:26.683 --> 09:34.870
But we are certainly working, we certainly are doing projects that are exploring it, and because we feel it will be in time.

09:35.030 --> 09:35.531
We see that.

09:35.771 --> 09:36.872
Yeah, absolutely.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.069
In two senses.

09:39.629 --> 09:44.753
One is the one I think that we're probably thinking of, though we haven't said so, as a conversion tool.

09:45.214 --> 09:45.574
Okay.

09:46.255 --> 09:48.737
But the other is... We were going to get to it.

09:48.757 --> 09:49.417
Right.

09:49.437 --> 09:56.263
But the other sense in which one has to use digitization as a preservation tool are for materials created in digital form.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.287
Explain that just a tad.

10:00.647 --> 10:06.792
Well, suppose we imagine a website where you have...

10:09.033 --> 10:12.397
Well, you have kind of a question-and-answer thing, which is interactive.

10:12.417 --> 10:15.219
You know, it allows you to move here, there, and otherwise on the website.

10:15.240 --> 10:22.527
Well, how would you capture the essence of that particular document in that medium in any other medium?

10:23.768 --> 10:24.489
That's right.

10:24.509 --> 10:25.630
You can't capture it in film.

10:25.650 --> 10:26.812
You can't capture it in paper.

10:27.312 --> 10:34.540
So we have to use the electronic medium to preserve what are sometimes called natively digital documents.

10:37.543 --> 10:38.584
The jargon is endless.

10:39.104 --> 10:41.607
Natively digital?

10:41.627 --> 10:41.987
Yes.

10:42.007 --> 10:43.129
Natively digital documents.

10:43.149 --> 10:44.490
So it's an adjective, natively.

10:44.590 --> 10:44.911
Yes.

10:45.371 --> 10:53.380
And that's to distinguish them from documents that have been converted into digital form from paper or film.

10:53.480 --> 11:01.890
Specifically in the field of preservation, are you working with special collections and rare materials?

11:04.373 --> 11:04.513
Mm-hmm.

11:04.533 --> 11:04.673
Mm-hmm.

11:04.693 --> 11:07.356
And unique items, obviously, which are manuscripts.

11:07.775 --> 11:24.059
Do you foresee electronic digitization as a means of, as an ultimate means of also converting these materials and then shedding vent?

11:24.220 --> 11:25.121
Right, right.

11:25.542 --> 11:36.398
I think the answer is, well, how to put it, the easiest and safest answer is no, because

11:36.597 --> 11:50.792
as long as these materials have artifactual value in addition to their surface information, that we would always want to preserve the original because it's carrying information itself that we can't copy.

11:52.253 --> 12:03.465
I mean, if we could perfectly replicate a document, including all of the possible scholarly information that that could have, which might not

12:04.424 --> 12:10.493
one might not want to overlook the chemical composition of the paper, which could help you date a particular document.

12:10.513 --> 12:14.959
You don't want the size, the quality of the paper, the binding, the illustrations.

12:15.560 --> 12:15.780
Absolutely.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.723
It's all part of the context.

12:17.743 --> 12:19.165
There's a book called Paratexts.

12:19.185 --> 12:20.126
Are you familiar with that?

12:20.186 --> 12:20.667
No, I'm not.

12:20.687 --> 12:21.909
Ken Carpenter at Harvard.

12:24.212 --> 12:25.193
I just got a copy.

12:25.213 --> 12:28.998
It was published by Cambridge University, of course.

12:29.018 --> 12:31.562
It's by a French scholar by the name of Gillette.

12:32.234 --> 12:45.931
And it just defines all these other textual elements, which he says, he said, you know, Ken basically supervises the selection of books that go from Widener into the depository.

12:46.512 --> 12:46.632
Right.

12:46.652 --> 12:50.477
And so I said, well, what are the criteria that you, you know, what do you apply?

12:50.537 --> 12:51.598
What are the standards?

12:51.738 --> 12:56.424
There were a lot of things, but he said there were also paratextual elements that I apply.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.806
And he said, read that book.

12:57.926 --> 12:59.488
So you should take a look at it, too.

12:59.568 --> 13:01.330
Paratext, one word.

13:01.732 --> 13:04.555
by Gillette, G-A-L-L-E-T-T.

13:05.036 --> 13:08.741
And if you want, I'll email you the citation on it, and I'll be able to find it.

13:08.861 --> 13:10.703
Probably not too many titles by that name.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.565
Yeah, and it should be available.

13:12.605 --> 13:14.308
It's 1997 from Cambridge University.

13:14.328 --> 13:26.002
It was originally published in French in 1987, but if only because Harvard is using it as a resource, you know, there might be a bit of interest.

13:26.022 --> 13:26.863
I'll have a look at it.

13:26.883 --> 13:27.083
Yeah.

13:27.103 --> 13:28.325
Well, it's a fascinating book.

13:28.345 --> 13:30.928
I was reading it in an airplane coming out.

13:31.347 --> 13:34.432
So anyway, I'm not sure we completely got through our thoughts on that.

13:34.472 --> 13:36.155
No, I went off on that.

13:36.255 --> 13:40.061
We were talking about rare and special collection material.

13:40.562 --> 13:49.677
And those you might want to image so that a lot of the uses that are made, otherwise of originals, could be transferred to the surrogate.

13:50.137 --> 13:55.566
And in a sense, that's certainly a form of preservation because it cuts down the wear and tear on the originals.

13:56.153 --> 14:13.776
But if one is thinking about replacement of the original with an electronic version, then I think that one has to be very clear that there's no artifactual value, i.e., there's nothing in the medium that's part of the message that one would want to preserve.

14:14.637 --> 14:22.868
You mentioned that Cornell is out ahead of you in terms of... And they're producing hard copies of the books that they scan, too.

14:22.888 --> 14:24.270
Are you doing the same kind of thing?

14:25.111 --> 14:36.807
When I was out there last year, just about a year ago, they were up to like 5,500 titles that they made, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it is a lot.

14:36.827 --> 14:37.347
That's a lot of work.

14:37.367 --> 14:38.189
It's a lot of work.

14:38.930 --> 14:41.553
And then they actually do make a hard copy.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.858
Put the hard copy back on the shelf.

14:44.878 --> 14:49.684
And then the original goes off to wherever it goes.

14:49.883 --> 14:51.765
So you're doing the same kind of thing?

14:52.406 --> 14:55.029
No, we have not gone into production with that at all.

14:56.690 --> 15:03.237
Our conversion efforts have been focused primarily on imaging.

15:04.439 --> 15:06.881
Sorry, I should have said that a different way.

15:06.921 --> 15:17.933
Well, most of our energies have been focused on archival collections for which there's a guide, which is known as a finding aid.

15:18.368 --> 15:21.812
A finding aid?

15:22.132 --> 15:23.754
That's something that you put out?

15:24.175 --> 15:24.856
We write them.

15:26.257 --> 15:35.288
Part of the work that a curator does of a collection is to organize it, sort it, and prepare what's known as a finding aid.

15:36.509 --> 15:48.223
What we've been doing is converting those finding aids to electronic forms so they can be searched by machines.

15:49.402 --> 15:52.305
for any word string you're interested in.

15:52.325 --> 16:14.309
And then secondly, attaching images of either letters or photographs or whatever in those archival collections to the finding aid so that you can online discover what subjects we have finding aids for or what subjects we have archival collections that pertain to them.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.371
Look at the finding aid itself

16:16.807 --> 16:26.316
have a sense of what's in the collection and click appropriate places in the finding aid and jump to the image of the original materials that are in the collection.

16:27.016 --> 16:39.207
And then, jumping quickly to your other hat, how do you decide what books are going to be deacidified and repaired and preserved?

16:40.008 --> 16:46.594
Is this something that's done systematically, or is it really a matter of books that are brought to you potentially?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.869
a couple of systems that are in place.

16:49.129 --> 16:57.938
The one is the system that most people don't think of as a system, and that is what we call our use-driven approach.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.623
And we believe there is a very strong argument to be made for that.

17:02.723 --> 17:06.868
Those are the materials that are in need to provide library service right now.

17:08.129 --> 17:16.598
Those are also the materials that if we don't attend to their needs, we're not going to be able to provide library service, because there's

17:17.371 --> 17:23.540
a known higher probability of materials that have been used once being used again.

17:25.564 --> 17:34.718
And so, we feel that our first priority in terms of preservation programming is to keep the parts of the collection that are in demand in serviceable condition.

17:35.539 --> 17:39.565
Parts of the collection that are not in demand, we can buy time with.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.706
Isn't there a point of no return where if you don't enter the conclusion?

17:44.726 --> 17:49.533
Absolutely, and that's the second systematic approach we take.

17:50.394 --> 18:09.400
Often with federal funding as part of national programs to preserve the corpus, that we have gone through subject by subject and pulled out the materials that were brittle, that even if they weren't in demand, and made copies of them in order

18:09.802 --> 18:12.786
to be sure that those materials will survive.

18:13.908 --> 18:15.831
And this is a systematic effort?

18:15.851 --> 18:18.475
Are you doing this on a regular basis?

18:18.535 --> 18:26.487
We have been for many years, Matt, and at the moment our systematic effort is with newspapers that are not commercially available.

18:26.907 --> 18:36.582
And we're going through our entire collection worldwide, set of newspapers, and anything that's not commercially available and is brittle, we are filming.

18:36.722 --> 18:38.104
What do you mean commercially available?

18:38.371 --> 18:42.796
It's often possible to buy microfilm copies of newspapers.

18:43.376 --> 18:43.717
I see.

18:44.097 --> 18:54.808
And if it's on the market, we're not going to bother making a film of it ourselves, because it costs about five times as much to make the original film as it does to buy a copy.

18:54.828 --> 19:04.378
So you're probably just talking about some early California newspapers, but not necessarily the— And India, and Pakistan, and all kinds of places.

19:05.000 --> 19:20.255
One factoid that's worth knowing, in terms of thinking about preservation of a collection and how that relates to worldwide information, is that libraries like ours, and this one in particular, that fifty percent of its materials are foreign.

19:21.737 --> 19:30.105
And foreign countries outside of Western Europe are nowhere near as likely to be systematically preserving their published output.

19:30.125 --> 19:33.949
So, you are preserving that stuff?

19:33.969 --> 19:34.129
Yeah.

19:34.514 --> 19:38.638
Are you familiar with a phrase called phase deterioration?

19:38.658 --> 19:39.819
Have you ever heard that phrase?

19:39.839 --> 19:41.901
Phase deterioration?

19:41.941 --> 19:42.742
No, I've not heard that.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.283
That's what I ran into at Cornell.

19:46.105 --> 19:48.507
It's basically a matter of policy there.

19:51.670 --> 20:02.901
What they're saying essentially is that a decision has been made, a decision has been made, and they've set up a procedure by which you evaluate a book, and they've given me a copy of this thing.

20:03.539 --> 20:16.651
And the decision is, well, okay, this isn't worth scanning, and it isn't really worth preserving, just, you know, committing the money and the labor, blah, blah, blah, to do it.

20:17.672 --> 20:18.953
But, of course, we're not going to dump it.

20:19.173 --> 20:21.395
But what we're going to do is put it on the shelf.

20:22.896 --> 20:28.301
We've decided not to undertake any heroic efforts, you know, no life support.

20:28.321 --> 20:31.504
It's going to be allowed to die with...

20:32.159 --> 20:34.062
not any invasive procedures.

20:34.522 --> 20:36.505
Do you do anything similar to that here?

20:37.006 --> 20:43.815
I suppose the answer is yes, because you remember the second systematic approach I told you about, which is that we go through subject by subject.

20:44.216 --> 20:59.938
We don't literally film everything in the collection in that subject that's brittle, because we have a curator review each of the titles, and they will decide at that particular time whether every title must be preserved.

21:00.914 --> 21:10.443
And, of course, they appreciate that even when we have large grants, those grants are small relative to the cost of preserving the entire collection.

21:10.543 --> 21:22.594
So, they are focusing on what they regard to be materials important enough to be sure that their survival—well, I didn't say that sentence right, but you know what I mean?

21:24.695 --> 21:30.921
So, where would you say most of your personal efforts are directed, or is it really a

21:31.340 --> 21:37.606
It wanders back and forth between the two responsibilities.

21:38.567 --> 21:50.157
And because there's overlap between the two, I find that's an area where I can get more work done because both are interested.

21:50.177 --> 22:00.587
There's quite a bit of interest in the conversion of some parts of the retrospective collections into digital form.

22:01.107 --> 22:11.137
in order to populate the digital environment and make it possible to do serious research, because there's enough stuff there.

22:12.959 --> 22:30.878
That part of my work would be the digitization work, and it would allow us to at least, at a minimum, reduce the wear and tear on the hard copy, and perhaps someday allow us to

22:31.533 --> 22:35.719
succeed the hard copy with the digital version.

22:36.800 --> 22:46.133
The other overlap point between those two sets of responsibilities is in archiving, as we call it, which is essentially digital preservation.

22:47.314 --> 22:53.142
How do we preserve this stuff which is in digital form, either converted to it or created in it originally?

22:54.464 --> 23:00.392
And that's an immensely complicated set of concerns for which

23:00.760 --> 23:04.744
We do not have any good management models thus far.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.307
Man, the field's changing too fast.

23:07.327 --> 23:07.427
Yeah.

23:07.947 --> 23:19.479
How about, you know, the integrity of the—I mean, it's known, and you see some gorgeous fifteenth-century books that, you know, they've lasted quite well over five hundred years.

23:19.499 --> 23:26.886
We know really, basically, how long paper lasts, and if you control the environment, it'll last longer.

23:27.288 --> 23:28.349
Sure.

23:29.130 --> 23:33.455
But we really don't know these things about digital.

23:33.495 --> 23:42.364
You mentioned photographs, how they degrade in a known way.

23:42.905 --> 23:46.008
But you can't say the same thing about digital.

23:46.028 --> 23:46.288
No.

23:46.629 --> 23:49.912
Well, I mean, it's such an interesting new medium in that regard.

23:49.932 --> 23:57.160
I mean, if you take both paper and film, you could anticipate a lifespan in centuries.

23:57.663 --> 24:09.797
that if you maintain decent environmental conditions, well, we could say, we could take a floppy disk, then we could say, now if we maintain this in decent environmental conditions, how much time can we get out of it?

24:10.839 --> 24:12.841
Well, people have actually done that.

24:13.121 --> 24:14.443
They've tried to figure that stuff out.

24:15.464 --> 24:17.887
And then we step back and say, well, now, wait a minute.

24:19.429 --> 24:20.090
Do we really care?

24:21.231 --> 24:26.978
Because the technology for reading the information on those disks is going to change

24:27.582 --> 24:34.188
more rapidly than the rate of deterioration of the medium itself.

24:34.208 --> 24:53.364
So that in the case of the digital environment, it's technological obsolescence that plays a much larger role in the so-called preservation problem, if you allow me to put it that way, than does the deterioration of the medium, the storage medium.

24:55.646 --> 24:56.307
Doesn't this

24:57.586 --> 25:16.863
I guess I'm, you know, I'm doing interviews all week, and I'm starting to stumble here, but doesn't it concern you that we really don't know whether or not the material, how long you can .

25:17.164 --> 25:25.551
And if once you digitize it, and you get rid of the original document or whatever,

25:26.324 --> 25:29.748
you know, there are no guarantees that you're going to— Absolutely.

25:29.868 --> 25:33.111
And that's why we do not use it as a preservation medium at this time.

25:34.573 --> 25:38.697
We do not throw anything away that we've digitized.

25:38.937 --> 25:41.440
It goes back in the collection.

25:41.460 --> 25:44.523
What we hope for is reduced wear and tear on that original.

25:44.863 --> 25:46.285
Sure.

25:46.305 --> 25:53.192
You know, like Roger started at Harvard, just bought some Black Panther, you know,

25:53.797 --> 25:56.721
mimeographed news lines from the 60s.

25:56.741 --> 25:58.784
He said, really, they're literally falling.

25:59.205 --> 26:01.969
They can absolutely, in his view, stand one read.

26:03.251 --> 26:12.224
And if I'm a scholar going in wanting to see this stuff, either he's not going to let me see it, or he's going to work something out with me.

26:12.244 --> 26:18.994
Maybe we can get a grant, and maybe if together we can stand this or microfilm it.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.308
Make a good copy, and then we'll put that archival.

26:22.328 --> 26:24.411
Maybe that's how you're going to get access to that.

26:24.431 --> 26:28.136
But this quite literally has one read, in his view.

26:29.237 --> 26:33.543
You know, these kinds of things face you all the time, I would think.

26:33.583 --> 26:37.428
You know, that does face destruction.

26:37.448 --> 26:44.037
But then he also said, but you know, can they guarantee me, you know, that this material, once it's scanned,

26:44.658 --> 26:46.680
they don't have any idea how long that will last.

26:46.700 --> 26:57.213
I mean, it is zeros and ones, I guess, but it's the migration of the material constantly from one... Right.

26:57.233 --> 27:06.083
Have you come across the pair of concepts that are usually used to address this thus far in your research, which is called refreshment and migration?

27:08.205 --> 27:10.869
Maybe you could refresh me with that.

27:10.909 --> 27:13.011
The concept of refreshment

27:13.582 --> 27:17.408
is when you make another copy of exactly the same thing.

27:18.429 --> 27:25.820
And you're just copying it from one magnetic medium, in our case, or one optical medium to another.

27:27.082 --> 27:29.886
So you had it on one floppy disk, you copy it to another floppy disk.

27:29.906 --> 27:33.731
You had it on one hard drive, you copy it to another hard drive.

27:33.892 --> 27:35.314
And that's refreshment.

27:35.394 --> 27:38.679
And that's done to address the problem of deterioration of the medium.

27:39.900 --> 27:43.065
Because all these media have lifespans.

27:43.298 --> 27:45.060
And it's a relatively short one, as we know.

27:46.701 --> 27:57.251
But the great promise of the digital medium is that you can refresh infinitely without changing a single one or zero.

27:58.332 --> 28:04.218
You can make copy after copy after copy after copy, which is, as you well know, in the analog environment, you can't do.

28:05.259 --> 28:06.720
Each generation has losses.

28:07.641 --> 28:08.162
That's right.

28:08.182 --> 28:10.504
Well, that's basically what you were saying about these

28:11.463 --> 28:13.046
There's one reed left.

28:13.226 --> 28:15.089
And that's it.

28:15.129 --> 28:16.992
So that's the concept of refreshment.

28:17.553 --> 28:31.878
And that's in many ways the basis upon which people originally tried to, the early adopters, if you will, of digitization tried to adopt it as a preservation medium.

28:33.781 --> 28:36.846
But there's this other nagging little problem called migration.

28:37.197 --> 28:38.539
for which the answer is migration.

28:38.599 --> 28:42.744
And migration is the answer to the obsolescence of the technology.

28:43.145 --> 28:49.233
In the first case, refreshment was the answer to the deterioration of the medium.

28:50.275 --> 28:53.419
Migration is the answer to obsolescence of the technology.

28:55.622 --> 29:02.872
And at the moment, we're seeing a situation where the technology is obsolescing more rapidly than the medium is deteriorating.

29:02.992 --> 29:06.917
Because every six months, you've got a new generation of PCs, that kind of thing.

29:07.319 --> 29:13.226
So somebody has to be alert enough to ensure— To never win.

29:13.246 --> 29:15.729
Yeah, and so there is the possibility there.

29:15.749 --> 29:16.390
Right, right.

29:16.410 --> 29:24.380
You're down now to the question of building the archiving model, the management model that keeps this data moving forward so you continue to have access to it.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.080
So what do we call it?

29:25.100 --> 29:29.366
You said building— Building the archiving model, you know.

29:29.446 --> 29:30.627
Are you involved in that?

29:31.168 --> 29:37.275
There is a very large organization of—oh, not a large organization, an important organization called the National

29:38.183 --> 29:46.673
Digital Library Federation that just got itself a new director whose name is Don Waters.

29:47.654 --> 30:01.670
And one of the three main objectives of that organization is to design and build a successful archiving model for digital information.

30:03.292 --> 30:03.932
Where are they at?

30:04.613 --> 30:05.053
Washington.

30:05.074 --> 30:07.296
Do you have a phone number for them?

30:07.316 --> 30:08.157
You know, I do not.

30:08.423 --> 30:10.806
But I might be able to call somebody and get you one.

30:10.966 --> 30:18.896
I don't know who's ... But the fellow who's now head of it, who you'd want to talk to, is probably still at Yale, because he just got appointed.

30:18.956 --> 30:19.697
And his name is?

30:19.857 --> 30:21.019
Don Waters.

30:21.039 --> 30:23.462
Don Waters is going to Yale?

30:23.482 --> 30:27.787
He is going to NDLF from Yale.

30:28.128 --> 30:30.891
NDLF, I'm sure I can find it, 202 area.

30:30.991 --> 30:33.434
NDLF is National Digital Library Federation.

30:33.575 --> 30:35.477
Okay, and they must have a website, too.

30:35.744 --> 30:37.427
They probably do.

30:37.747 --> 30:42.033
As a matter of fact, I'm sure they do, but I don't know if you'd find it under NDLS.

30:42.053 --> 30:44.437
But you might with the regular webcrawler.

30:44.597 --> 30:46.420
I'll find you.

30:46.440 --> 30:52.369
But if you don't, also just call the Yale Library, because he's the associate director at Yale.

30:54.072 --> 30:57.717
And he's going from Yale to this organization.

30:57.857 --> 30:58.358
Interesting.

30:58.759 --> 31:02.124
Is he a print person, going to a digital?

31:02.484 --> 31:05.008
No, he's more a systems person.

31:05.545 --> 31:09.992
computer person.

31:10.152 --> 31:14.799
But not, I don't think that by any means all of his background, just he's had an interest in that for years.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.023
So, let's look at yourself, your background.

31:17.243 --> 31:24.314
Well, let me finish up this thing on migration, so you have this particular distinction, because it's incredibly important in this field.

31:25.076 --> 31:30.404
With the concept of refreshment, as I said, I made an endless number of generations of exact copies.

31:31.285 --> 31:33.088
Migration is when you

31:34.604 --> 31:49.109
when you move the digital file from one platform to another, platform being the combination of hardware and software that enables you to manipulate and view whatever it is that the file contains.

31:50.752 --> 31:57.143
In the migration concept, you change the code.

31:57.163 --> 31:58.806
So the document

31:59.309 --> 32:01.492
is not necessarily going to be the same.

32:01.632 --> 32:03.515
As a matter of fact, I shouldn't put it that way.

32:03.595 --> 32:04.877
It's definitely not the same.

32:07.180 --> 32:12.768
The document, not in terms of content, but in terms of— It could be just one-digit difference.

32:14.430 --> 32:27.949
It could be absolutely inconsequential, but if you had a file check program running, you would see that what was your file

32:28.267 --> 32:33.856
called Document A, when migrated to another platform is not exactly the same document.

32:33.936 --> 32:34.497
Why is that?

32:35.158 --> 32:48.538
Because different hardware and software makes different requirements of the file itself in order to manipulate it and manage it.

32:48.618 --> 32:52.083
It's like taking a WordPerfect document and opening it up to Microsoft Word.

32:53.165 --> 32:55.168
You don't get exactly the same thing.

32:56.718 --> 32:57.879
Well, that's a concern, isn't it?

32:58.159 --> 32:58.780
It sure is.

33:00.161 --> 33:00.682
It sure is.

33:00.862 --> 33:01.863
That's a major concern.

33:01.923 --> 33:02.964
It's not a new concern.

33:04.025 --> 33:14.416
And I'll give you an example that just kind of really makes me smile, because people think we're talking about something brand new in the world.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.479
Well, you have an original document.

33:17.499 --> 33:18.580
You're writing one right there.

33:19.020 --> 33:20.362
I'll go out and make a photocopy.

33:21.002 --> 33:21.943
Is it the same document?

33:23.204 --> 33:23.805
It contains

33:24.123 --> 33:25.124
the same information.

33:25.444 --> 33:26.926
Depends on the quality of my photocopy.

33:27.367 --> 33:31.651
I may not capture it exactly, but there's possible change.

33:32.352 --> 33:41.202
Yeah, but if your photocopy maybe for some reason has a blind spot here and NDLS falls off, then there's a significant difference.

33:41.222 --> 33:42.724
Then there's a significant difference, right.

33:42.804 --> 33:45.247
And so what you're suggesting is something similar to that.

33:45.287 --> 33:47.329
Maybe it only will be one or two

33:47.815 --> 33:48.836
the zeros and ones.

33:48.856 --> 33:50.218
The ones that are changed.

33:50.238 --> 33:52.561
But it might just be the ones that affect the NDLF.

33:52.781 --> 33:53.342
Absolutely.

33:53.482 --> 33:54.503
Exactly.

33:54.763 --> 33:55.164
Exactly.

33:55.184 --> 33:56.926
You've got the point.

33:56.946 --> 33:57.066
Right.

33:57.086 --> 33:57.327
Right.

33:57.347 --> 33:58.168
And that's a concern.

33:58.468 --> 33:58.728
Sure.

33:58.788 --> 33:59.429
Sure.

33:59.449 --> 34:00.911
But it's not a new concern.

34:01.492 --> 34:02.433
People thought it was new.

34:02.893 --> 34:04.395
We have the same thing with photocopying.

34:04.435 --> 34:07.379
We have the same thing with microfilming.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.847
All it takes is just a little bit of a loss, which might seem insignificant otherwise, to be at the right point in the right letter.

34:14.728 --> 34:16.590
Or if you have a formula,

34:17.144 --> 34:27.980
You know, and what begins as a division sign looks like in your copy a minus sign, because you don't see those little dots.

34:30.043 --> 34:31.725
We've got migration problems.

34:32.146 --> 34:33.989
Okay, but at least we've kept the original.

34:34.690 --> 34:35.691
That's right, that's right.

34:36.693 --> 34:37.974
We have the archival copy.

34:38.035 --> 34:39.437
If you've kept the original, right.

34:40.318 --> 34:43.843
But there are, you probably have come across them, there are great

34:44.870 --> 34:48.114
I don't know if they're apocryphal or, in fact, they are real.

34:48.715 --> 35:01.871
Stories of scholars who have done research on surrogates of originals, published on them, never gone back to take a look at the original, and made mistakes in their conclusions because they were operating off of copies.

35:04.755 --> 35:06.817
I haven't heard any specific instances of that.

35:06.837 --> 35:08.980
Nor have I, which is why I think it might be apocryphal.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.607
However, I've interviewed Stephen Jay Gould for this book, who's a book person.

35:15.616 --> 35:23.363
He's also a great scientist and a writer, and he says he will not do research with facsimiles.

35:25.546 --> 35:27.748
Sounds like he must have been burned at some point.

35:27.768 --> 35:31.431
Well, he just has a feeling, and he says, I can't explain it, but I get something from the original.

35:31.451 --> 35:31.771
Ah, yeah.

35:31.792 --> 35:32.953
Well, he goes beyond that.

35:33.393 --> 35:38.558
It's also a ... But there were things, you know.

35:38.618 --> 35:43.783
I mean, when I was at Cornell, I don't know if it was a group.

35:45.502 --> 35:48.186
It's an example of information capture.

35:49.007 --> 35:53.213
And to come back to our point is, what does one have to do with the other?

35:55.476 --> 36:02.306
Among all of the library specializations, the specialists in information capture are in the preservation departments.

36:03.308 --> 36:04.209
They're the folks who know.

36:04.229 --> 36:11.239
They're the folks who have to know, because they're the ones who are doing treatments that risk loss of information.

36:12.232 --> 36:13.553
Even when you're conserving.

36:13.573 --> 36:15.715
Even when you know the consequences.

36:16.095 --> 36:17.376
Absolutely, absolutely.

36:17.436 --> 36:41.597
So whether it's our photographic folks who have great eyes when it comes to actually spotting things to see whether or not they got captured, or whether it comes to our conservators who might do deacidification, but then again they might not if they see there are depressions in the paper that actually carry information that if that paper was gotten wet, it would lift it out.

36:41.948 --> 36:42.609
They would be gone.

36:44.111 --> 36:45.953
Those kinds of things are what these folks are about.

36:45.973 --> 36:48.196
That's what these people are doing for you.

36:48.456 --> 36:48.617
Yeah.

36:48.637 --> 36:53.503
I mean, that's the sort of work that they are specialists in, is to not lose information.

36:54.484 --> 36:57.088
And tell me a little bit about your own background.

36:57.248 --> 37:00.973
Is it in computers, or is it— No, my background is in preservation.

37:00.993 --> 37:01.814
In preservation.

37:01.974 --> 37:05.078
I started off at a library called the Newberry Library in Chicago.

37:05.098 --> 37:09.143
Well, it's in my previous book, but in great detail.

37:09.604 --> 37:10.605
Right.

37:11.058 --> 37:15.384
country's first in-house conservation department.

37:15.404 --> 37:16.446
Okay.

37:16.466 --> 37:16.566
Yeah.

37:16.586 --> 37:17.427
I didn't know that.

37:17.447 --> 37:17.848
I didn't know.

37:18.589 --> 37:38.938
Yeah, and that when I finished my undergraduate degree in philosophy, I thought that I would really like to do something in this field, and I cast about looking for places I could study, and it boiled down to either I could go to Italy, or I could go to a program in England, or I

37:39.087 --> 37:45.315
would have had an offer to come to Chicago and apprentice myself in that program for a couple of years, which is what I did.

37:45.715 --> 37:46.456
And where did you go?

37:46.636 --> 37:47.758
Where did you study philosophy?

37:48.739 --> 37:49.780
At Bucknell University.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.121
I see.

37:50.281 --> 37:51.362
So, you're from the East?

37:51.643 --> 37:54.666
Yeah, from Pennsylvania.

37:54.687 --> 38:05.500
And then while I'm in Chicago, I went to the University of Chicago and took a master's in the library work and specialized in administration and conservation.

38:05.733 --> 38:06.634
and the history of the book.

38:06.974 --> 38:09.377
Do you know Alice Schreier from the University of Chicago?

38:09.617 --> 38:10.158
I knew of her.

38:10.178 --> 38:11.359
I never took one of her classes.

38:11.379 --> 38:13.601
Yeah, she's excellent.

38:14.302 --> 38:18.347
So, you've got your masters in library science, is that what it is?

38:18.367 --> 38:18.547
Uh-huh.

38:18.567 --> 38:21.390
It's actually called Librarianship at the University of Chicago.

38:21.410 --> 38:22.451
Do they still teach it there?

38:22.471 --> 38:23.012
No, no.

38:23.032 --> 38:24.033
It's a program that's gone.

38:24.353 --> 38:25.694
And as it is here?

38:26.435 --> 38:32.642
Yes, now our school has been reborn as the School of Information Management and Systems.

38:32.662 --> 38:35.605
And as it is at Columbia, which was the—

38:36.344 --> 38:38.427
How do you feel about that?

38:39.669 --> 38:54.232
Well, I think that it's in some ways very akin to the comment I made earlier, and that is that in the electronic environment there's the perception that everything is brand new and it's all different.

38:54.973 --> 39:04.208
But what I see is that the fundamental structure of information, how it's delivered and how it's preserved, it all carries forward from one medium to the next.

39:05.116 --> 39:08.541
And there's a lot more that's the same than is different.

39:09.903 --> 39:32.338
And that I think that maybe because so much of online information provision was born of computer science interests in finding an application for these new tools that they built, that we haven't

39:32.791 --> 39:42.466
spent adequate time recognizing what kinds of institutions are already in our society that manage information intelligently.

39:42.786 --> 40:01.515
And I think that because there's this perception that somehow that information management and provision is all brand new and it's all going to happen digitally, and it's all part of a new science, that the

40:02.761 --> 40:07.146
concept of librarianship seems old-fashioned and possibly obsolete.

40:07.787 --> 40:08.508
Do you agree with that?

40:08.568 --> 40:10.230
No, I completely disagree.

40:11.471 --> 40:18.279
Does it help that—not only that you have this training as a librarian, I guess—would you consider yourself a librarian?

40:18.900 --> 40:19.120
Yes.

40:19.340 --> 40:22.945
Yes, I have the traditional library training.

40:23.646 --> 40:24.887
Okay.

40:25.207 --> 40:28.191
And also you have the training as a philosopher.

40:28.251 --> 40:31.755
Does it help that you have this

40:32.933 --> 40:34.415
worldview, I guess?

40:34.975 --> 40:35.816
I think it does.

40:35.896 --> 40:39.700
In this particular position that you have here.

40:39.900 --> 40:54.135
I find that what I'm able to bring to my work is not only a sense of—let's see how to put this.

40:54.155 --> 40:57.579
Hang on just a second.

40:57.599 --> 40:58.840
What's up?

41:04.861 --> 41:12.007
I feel that one of the toughest challenges that we have to make is deciding what information survives.

41:12.968 --> 41:15.430
No library collects everything.

41:17.112 --> 41:22.276
No organization collects everything and saves it in perpetuity.

41:22.296 --> 41:26.820
The challenge is how to identify what's most important to be saved.

41:30.043 --> 41:33.906
And I don't mean saving in the narrow sense of what a preservation program does.

41:34.122 --> 41:42.331
in order to optimize the life of the medium, or when the medium is at the end of its use life, convert it into another medium.

41:43.392 --> 41:48.558
I'm talking about the much more difficult problem of deciding what should be in the library in the first place.

41:49.539 --> 41:53.183
And then once it's here and it's reached the end of its service life, what should continue?

41:55.566 --> 42:02.053
And I think that's the essence of what we do.

42:03.772 --> 42:10.961
society's most responsible agents for preservation of the human record.

42:11.461 --> 42:12.963
That's a great quote.

42:13.924 --> 42:16.327
I think this is the philosophy we're talking about.

42:16.888 --> 42:19.791
Well, that's what I get excited about in this work.

42:19.811 --> 42:21.213
That's what I get excited about.

42:21.233 --> 42:23.816
That's great.

42:24.197 --> 42:25.378
Excellent.

42:26.319 --> 42:28.982
Do you mind if I feel free to call you at some point?

42:29.002 --> 42:31.045
Fine.

42:31.065 --> 42:32.867
I'll work it through.

42:33.995 --> 42:38.200
Right, right.

42:38.220 --> 42:42.025
And now that you like email, do you mind email?

42:42.085 --> 42:43.346
I prefer it, as a matter of fact.

42:43.366 --> 42:43.907
I like it, too.

42:43.927 --> 42:44.608
Easier for me.

42:47.271 --> 42:47.792
Right.

42:47.952 --> 42:50.715
One more bit of jargon.

42:51.777 --> 42:55.882
Under the digital library hat, we call that asynchronous communication.

42:56.823 --> 42:58.244
I just love it.

42:58.705 --> 42:59.646
Asynchronous?

42:59.666 --> 43:00.407
Right.

43:01.180 --> 43:03.383
Meaning that we can do it out of time with each other.

43:03.403 --> 43:04.123
Isn't it amazing?

43:04.404 --> 43:10.271
I've carried my little computer with me, and I'm setting up as an excuse of what a conversation could go.

43:10.591 --> 43:12.353
You're a young man.

43:12.373 --> 43:13.795
Do you mind me asking your age?

43:14.195 --> 43:14.776
49.

43:14.876 --> 43:16.738
It is interesting.

43:17.139 --> 43:18.981
I went to the MIT media lab.

43:19.341 --> 43:26.509
If you haven't done it already, it might be fun for you, because it certainly was for me, to read some of Neil Stevenson's stuff.

43:26.530 --> 43:27.771
You don't know him.

43:28.051 --> 43:30.394
A fiction writer.

43:30.796 --> 43:33.780
Neil Stephenson, S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S-O-N.

43:35.542 --> 43:38.486
Now I'm going to try to remember the titles.

43:39.206 --> 43:53.825
One of them was The Diamond Age, and that's a story about a little girl who is given a book that learns from her and teaches her what she needs to know.

43:55.186 --> 43:59.031
And the way that's played out is actually less interesting.

43:59.467 --> 44:10.006
Because the idea of the book that presents her the information she needs, as she needs it, and learns from her that— Well, is the book going to become an entity?

44:10.326 --> 44:22.909
Well, I mean, what it is is a communications medium with what they call RACTORS, R-A-C-T-O-R-S, which is, I think, a combination

44:23.227 --> 44:25.230
between reaction and actor.

44:25.491 --> 44:26.933
This is his word or this is the word?

44:26.953 --> 44:28.014
It's his word in the book.

44:28.455 --> 44:29.096
You'll come across it.

44:29.116 --> 44:29.998
Is he a contemporary?

44:30.038 --> 44:30.759
Is he around now?

44:30.819 --> 44:31.620
Yes, he's writing now.

44:31.780 --> 44:34.685
He's written other things?

44:34.725 --> 44:39.212
Yes, the one that I most enjoyed and I just remembered is called Snow Crash.

44:40.013 --> 44:40.895
Is this science fiction?

44:40.915 --> 44:41.155
It is.

44:41.896 --> 44:42.537
Cyber fiction.

44:43.018 --> 44:43.919
Cyber fiction?

44:43.939 --> 44:44.941
Right.

44:44.961 --> 44:46.944
Is it published in Hightower or paperback?

44:47.004 --> 44:47.785
Paperback.

44:47.845 --> 44:51.411
You'll pick it up at the airport and you get back on the plane.

44:51.931 --> 45:10.335
And Snow Crash is a story of how people are going to use the digital environment and cyberspace as the next entertainment medium.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.277
Now, you read this stuff a lot?

45:12.638 --> 45:13.959
No, I hardly ever read it.

45:14.260 --> 45:16.383
I only read it because— Why do you read these?

45:16.603 --> 45:18.646
Because it has so much to do with information.

45:18.906 --> 45:20.588
How did you find out about it?

45:21.412 --> 45:21.915
I don't know.

45:22.519 --> 45:23.848
I don't know where I found out about that.

45:23.868 --> 45:24.733
I'm going to write about it.

45:24.753 --> 45:26.283
I'm going to record the fiction.

45:26.303 --> 45:27.068
I'm reading that.
