WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:07.413
Well, it's a great pleasure, as I said.

00:07.913 --> 00:28.414
I guess with all the changes that have taken place in your country, which we don't have to go into in detail, of course, but I wonder what kind of, how does that affect you as a novelist, as a writer of such great stature?

00:30.156 --> 00:31.978
Well, as a writer, it doesn't really

00:32.667 --> 00:46.023
affect me in terms of my work, you know, because it wasn't apartheid that made me a writer and it isn't the end of apartheid that's going to stop me.

00:46.363 --> 00:50.868
It makes a big difference in my life as a human being, as a citizen.

00:52.310 --> 00:57.756
Tremendous changes and of course great joy that it happened in my lifetime.

00:57.776 --> 01:01.020
I sometimes began to think that I would never see

01:01.388 --> 01:04.191
freedom I never see democracy begun in my country.

01:04.211 --> 01:10.898
Well, I use that question actually as a way to enter a conversation, actually, and I understand that completely, of course.

01:11.939 --> 01:27.295
But as a writer whose work is influenced by political events and whose writing, indeed, sparked the world's consciousness about situations, what kind of

01:27.747 --> 01:37.117
responsibility does that put on you now, with the understanding that your work is so influential and it is charged by this?

01:37.337 --> 01:43.363
You see, I don't think about my work as influential at all.

01:43.483 --> 01:56.877
To me, I'm simply trying to understand life while we are here, how we cope with the business of being alive, what our relationships are like.

01:57.650 --> 02:16.013
So that the fact that my books were so quote-unquote political was because I was living in, born into, and lived my life in this society that was so much shaped by conflict, by political conflict, which of course in practical terms is human conflict.

02:17.234 --> 02:23.742
Now there's the very different kind of atmosphere at home.

02:24.464 --> 02:33.535
And that is this extraordinary determination to reconstruct, to make a normal life for people out of what was abnormal.

02:36.439 --> 02:40.724
Really people have to begin to learn how to live in a new way.

02:43.107 --> 02:47.232
It's a tremendous kind of challenge.

02:48.292 --> 02:55.240
already in the last three years, because it didn't, the changes didn't begin only after the election on the 27th of April.

02:55.601 --> 02:57.162
They were beginning before then.

02:58.224 --> 03:04.231
And I could see so many new things that people were facing.

03:05.332 --> 03:10.899
It doesn't mean to say that the kind of dangers that were there before or gone, that that's the end of everything.

03:10.919 --> 03:12.500
People have conflicts in their lives.

03:12.861 --> 03:18.147
They have ambitions to follow both in politics and outside politics.

03:18.481 --> 03:34.122
There is, for instance, a very interesting situation between the people who were in exile and who come back and who have certain expectations that perhaps are not met or are met beyond their wildest dreams.

03:36.805 --> 03:39.309
This is something that I find very interesting.

03:39.829 --> 03:45.737
Then there's the completely new fact that now black and white people are going to live

03:46.696 --> 03:54.407
are already beginning to live together in the sense that there's no more segregation in living conditions and so on.

03:54.808 --> 03:58.092
So black people can move in where they like.

03:59.294 --> 04:00.696
They have exactly the same rights.

04:00.716 --> 04:01.978
We all have the same rights now.

04:02.338 --> 04:04.161
We are South Africans for the first time.

04:04.181 --> 04:16.078
Of course, the experience in this country is, while you certainly now have the right to do certain things, whether or not it comes to pass as a practical matter, that takes generations, doesn't it?

04:16.227 --> 04:24.277
I mean, you can't force white people to all of a sudden consider black people to be their brothers and sisters, I mean, in terms of attitudes.

04:24.617 --> 04:27.701
You see, the situation is very different from the one in America.

04:28.162 --> 04:32.547
Here you have a white majority and a black minority.

04:33.108 --> 04:38.895
You have black people who came here like everybody else.

04:39.456 --> 04:41.818
They have lost their language.

04:41.899 --> 04:44.682
Many of them don't know where they came from.

04:45.337 --> 04:52.265
They have lost everything except the black skin that makes you African.

04:54.968 --> 04:56.790
They are Americans.

04:59.092 --> 05:00.574
Afro-Americans.

05:01.955 --> 05:13.268
I understand that perfectly because they find it difficult to be respected for what they are.

05:13.737 --> 05:15.980
There's nothing wrong with the term blacks.

05:16.621 --> 05:19.064
It's a perfectly honourable way to talk with people.

05:19.084 --> 05:23.369
Some people are black, some people are white, some people are blonde, some people are dark haired.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.552
This is just the way that we are made.

05:26.032 --> 05:34.082
At home in South Africa it's really very different because first of all the blacks are vastly in the majority.

05:34.943 --> 05:35.524
Vastly.

05:36.305 --> 05:38.187
The whites are the minority.

05:38.207 --> 05:42.833
The whites are the people who have to make this

05:43.184 --> 05:44.045
adaptation.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.067
And they are the ones who came.

05:46.087 --> 05:48.350
And they are the ones who came, exactly.

05:48.730 --> 05:51.173
The others were there, are there.

05:51.653 --> 06:04.748
And despite the years of colonialism and then of apartheid repression, people retain something that I think is terribly important, and I know that from my life at home.

06:04.888 --> 06:06.390
They've retained their languages.

06:07.298 --> 06:09.501
They've retained their customs.

06:09.541 --> 06:10.943
I'm not talking about tribalism.

06:11.143 --> 06:21.356
I'm talking the way that different people, Italians, Jews, Christians, Muslims, celebrate the occasions of life, births, marriages, deaths, and so on.

06:21.376 --> 06:24.821
So it's not a melting pot, as the phrase is used in this country.

06:25.061 --> 06:27.364
No, no.

06:27.444 --> 06:32.951
I'm sorry for interrupting, but what you're saying is that they have retained their culture.

06:32.971 --> 06:36.816
The great majority of people are at home in their own culture.

06:38.146 --> 06:44.094
If you don't mind if I jump around a little bit, too, because I do make sense out of it when I transcribe the tape.

06:45.597 --> 06:50.504
Winning the Nobel Prize, what kind of added responsibility?

06:50.924 --> 07:02.521
Do you feel this now when you write that perhaps millions of more people are now watching and now saying, this is one of the great living writers?

07:03.522 --> 07:07.107
Do you feel this sense that I really have to produce?

07:07.525 --> 07:09.949
No, not at all.

07:10.289 --> 07:31.221
And I think I was very fortunate in that the book that I've just published, the novel I've just published, I had begun in 1990, a whole year before I got that prize, because many people tell me that there's a great crisis if you start a new work after you've got this prize.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.865
I was fortunately not in that position.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.868
I was already deep in my novel.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.750
What kind of a crisis, just out of curiosity?

07:38.071 --> 07:50.649
Well, the very one you described, that they feel that everybody's waiting to see what they're going to produce next and waiting to say, ah, well, you see, now this book is really a great disappointment from a Nobel Prize winner.

07:51.009 --> 08:01.444
On the other hand, there are people certainly, and I say this as a great compliment, I mean, you do not sell in the same, your books do not

08:01.694 --> 08:05.619
sell as many book copies as the commercial best-selling types.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.000
Far from it.

08:08.201 --> 08:08.602
Pardon me.

08:09.783 --> 08:22.418
But now, with this exposure, I suspect that a lot of people who hadn't read you before or even perhaps hadn't heard of you before might now be likely to pick up one of your books and come to you for the first time.

08:22.778 --> 08:24.640
It varies from country to country.

08:25.742 --> 08:26.523
It's interesting.

08:27.364 --> 08:31.228
In England, for example, the Nobel Prize means very little.

08:32.407 --> 08:41.620
As far as they're concerned, the Booker Prize is just as important, but it's their own prize just for their own people or for Commonwealth, so I don't know how they can compare it with the World Prize.

08:42.101 --> 08:49.532
The fact is the Nobel Prize has made no difference in Britain to the sales of my books at all.

08:49.552 --> 08:49.812
Really?

08:49.892 --> 09:02.110
It's been very different in America, in Canada, in Germany, and of course there are always new translations that come once you've got the Nobel Prize.

09:02.815 --> 09:06.900
But I don't think it makes such an enormous difference.

09:06.961 --> 09:09.844
It depends, too, on what kind of writer you are.

09:10.245 --> 09:17.635
I'm sure when Saul Bellow, for instance, got the Nobel Prize, probably there was a tremendous rise in his sales.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.099
I would think Tony Morrison as well.

09:21.179 --> 09:22.541
And Tony Morrison, now.

09:23.162 --> 09:30.612
When you think of a wonderful writer like the Egyptian, Nagib Mahfouz, about whom, indeed, I've

09:31.148 --> 09:35.113
to whom I devote one of the Norton lectures that I'm giving.

09:36.014 --> 09:40.700
Even among people I know who are extremely well-read, they have not read Mapuj.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.400
I haven't.

09:41.420 --> 09:41.981
There, you are.

09:42.121 --> 09:43.443
You're a great reader.

09:43.463 --> 09:44.204
It's a confession.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.527
Yes, but it's not uncommon, I assure you.

09:47.007 --> 09:55.958
So the fact that in 1988, I think, he got the Nobel Prize, I don't think it made much difference in his life.

09:56.275 --> 10:06.206
I'm absolutely delighted that he's got the Nobel Prize because I'm a great admirer of the only three books that have translated into English that I've been able to read.

10:06.266 --> 10:09.830
And he's not known at all, really.

10:10.090 --> 10:16.457
But now, of course, publishers, I suppose, will begin to bring out translation of these books.

10:16.477 --> 10:25.928
I'm not meaning to suggest, certainly expectation is there, but to go back, you said that this book was in progress when you received the award.

10:26.498 --> 10:30.822
And you say that it affected none of the creative process.

10:34.246 --> 10:41.493
But then again, the changes, these tremendously dramatic changes that were taking place in your country were in progress as well.

10:41.753 --> 10:45.137
And they were certainly influencing the writing of this book.

10:45.277 --> 10:49.701
But you see, that's been the case with every book that I've written.

10:50.582 --> 10:55.527
Because in South Africa, there has been, over my writing years,

10:55.861 --> 10:59.906
one extraordinary crisis after another.

11:01.207 --> 11:03.710
But this of course was the resolving one, you're quite right.

11:03.750 --> 11:08.575
This was the joyous one that had some anxious moments.

11:09.476 --> 11:19.708
But in other words, I was used to, I've been used to all my life working in a completely volatile atmosphere.

11:20.414 --> 11:27.022
Tell me, again, we're hopping around if that's okay, but tell me a little bit about these Norton lectures that you're giving here.

11:28.684 --> 11:30.987
Are they all on the subject of literature?

11:32.469 --> 11:34.752
Well, I've given myself rather free reign.

11:35.393 --> 11:45.466
I've taken as the overall title what was indeed the title of my Nobel literature, which was Writing and Being, a relationship between the two.

11:45.486 --> 11:48.970
And the first one, which I gave last week,

11:49.540 --> 11:57.651
called Adam's Rib, and it was about how writers form characters and the misconceptions that people have about this.

11:59.533 --> 12:19.260
And the one that I'm giving today is called Hanging on a Sunrise, which is a quotation from a poem written by a friend of mine, a black

12:19.544 --> 12:21.727
poet and a revolutionary.

12:22.648 --> 12:27.314
And it's about revolutionary writing.

12:28.836 --> 12:39.749
I found it interesting that in many countries, people who go through great experiences are unable then to write about them.

12:39.769 --> 12:40.750
I mean, they're not writers.

12:40.811 --> 12:48.420
And I think Camus remarked on this after the war, because in the resistance,

12:48.974 --> 12:56.164
He had known so many people who had had extraordinary experiences and he hoped that some remarkable literature would come out of this.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.006
It didn't.

13:00.571 --> 13:17.395
In South Africa there is suddenly quite a number of books being written by people who were the makers of our revolution and whose experiences we

13:18.067 --> 13:30.126
Most of us who were either in a different part of the movement or on the fringe of the movement didn't know about because necessarily much of their actions had to be secret.

13:30.166 --> 13:40.322
There were people who were involved in underground work in the country and going back and forth, coming in and out into the skies, all very extraordinary.

13:41.223 --> 13:45.610
So I've chosen two books written by such people.

13:46.467 --> 13:53.618
The one written by a man called Ronnie Casseroles, who came from a poor... How do we spell?

13:54.258 --> 14:00.988
Ronnie is the usual, N-N-I-E, and then it's K-A-S-R-I-L-S, Casseroles.

14:01.008 --> 14:01.830
Okay, fine, thank you.

14:03.432 --> 14:14.348
And he was born into a working class Jewish immigrant family.

14:15.796 --> 14:41.770
and was rather clever at school but didn't seem to have much opportunity to go to university, worked in a factory, became interested in the trade union movement, got some sort of scholarship to study, retained his interest in trade unions, and from that went into the, what is that, that's the school of London.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.131
Oh, it's just that they're seasoned.

14:43.172 --> 14:45.094
Yeah, they probably saw a tale.

14:45.952 --> 15:11.981
joined the African National Congress underground, because it was already banned by then, and was one of a very few white men who actually were in the guerrilla army, in Mkwonto Wissizwe, the sphere of the nation, fighting outside the country, on the borders of the country, and organizing the underground.

15:13.422 --> 15:15.925
And he had a big position, a commanding position,

15:16.225 --> 15:17.066
in that army.

15:17.767 --> 15:20.670
So there were very, very few white men who lived like that.

15:21.651 --> 15:28.940
He also came in and out the country in disguise and was known to the newspapers as the Red Pimpernel because he was a communist.

15:30.262 --> 15:38.351
And he's a very flamboyant figure and I think he enjoyed having this thing called the Red Pimpernel.

15:38.792 --> 15:43.417
His book is called Armed and Dangerous because that was also what he was said to be.

15:44.659 --> 15:45.760
So he's written

15:46.246 --> 15:55.860
a very lively book about his experiences sharing all sorts of things that we really didn't know.

15:57.102 --> 16:11.483
We suddenly discovered that around the corner from where he lived he and some other people were busy making bonds to sabotage and electrical stations and so on.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.548
So his background is Jewish

16:15.963 --> 16:22.732
communist, humanist, no religion at all.

16:22.752 --> 16:32.625
The other man, Carl Niehaus, is a young Afrikaner from a small village born into a sort of fundamentalist Christian family, Dutch Reformed Church.

16:34.167 --> 16:39.034
And in his book, which he calls Fighting for Hope,

16:39.267 --> 16:40.729
Carl with a K or a C?

16:40.749 --> 16:44.312
Carl with a C, and Niehaus the German way, N-I-E.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.034
H-A-U-S, Niehaus.

16:46.855 --> 16:51.280
He somehow struggled out of this, it's fascinating, out of this background.

16:52.421 --> 17:06.996
And he too became a member of the ANC, went into the underground, and instead of going into exile and coming in and out like a casserole, he got caught, was portrayed by somebody, he got 15 years.

17:07.094 --> 17:13.181
of which he served seven, and then came the change and amnesty.

17:13.201 --> 17:15.203
Now, when we're talking about books, we're talking about fiction.

17:15.223 --> 17:18.666
Sir, if I can just finish this, my interest is the contrast.

17:18.807 --> 17:22.110
The two people, and he's still a devout Christian.

17:22.631 --> 17:23.492
I know him well.

17:23.512 --> 17:28.757
His whole move toward being a revolution, he was from a Christian base.

17:28.777 --> 17:33.763
So you have these two people arriving at the same point from a completely different background.

17:33.783 --> 17:36.105
So I deal with them, and then also with two

17:36.625 --> 17:39.427
two poets who were imprisoned underneath.

17:39.908 --> 17:42.010
And how many lectures are there in the series?

17:42.170 --> 17:42.790
That's two.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.952
Then I've got three on different writers.

17:44.992 --> 17:46.874
One on... So it's quite, it's a whole series?

17:46.894 --> 17:47.214
Six.

17:47.234 --> 17:47.795
Oh, it's six.

17:47.935 --> 17:48.195
Wow.

17:48.615 --> 17:52.519
One is Mahfouz, Nagit Mahfouz.

17:52.579 --> 17:55.481
The next one is Chinua Achebe.

17:55.501 --> 17:59.184
And the third one is Amos Oz.

17:59.605 --> 18:01.466
Yes, it's wonderful, especially the female.

18:01.486 --> 18:02.327
This last book was great.

18:02.727 --> 18:05.890
And then the sixth one is more or less...

18:06.410 --> 18:12.858
about my consciousness as a colonial.

18:13.038 --> 18:16.642
The colonial consciousness, how you come out of that to something different.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.284
That's the concluding lecture?

18:18.324 --> 18:21.048
That must, I imagine, that's... Are these all prepared?

18:21.088 --> 18:22.449
You've done... Oh, yes.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.991
I'm not someone who can add live.

18:24.552 --> 18:30.839
So you have a script, so to speak, and these are graduate students that attend these?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.021
No, this is a public lecture.

18:32.762 --> 18:34.864
I think I will attempt to...

18:35.266 --> 18:42.574
It's held tonight, it's in the Saunders Theatre, and then later, the next one, the next two, I think, are in the lower.

18:42.594 --> 18:44.015
And Cambridge is so wonderful.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.977
I'm sure they're out on the streets.

18:46.138 --> 18:47.619
I mean, I've been to lectures here.

18:47.639 --> 18:51.203
There was one earlier this year for Elizabeth Bishop.

18:51.363 --> 18:56.208
Robert Giroux came up to, did you read her letters, by the way?

18:56.248 --> 18:57.650
Giroux's writing a book.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.772
Wonderful.

19:00.241 --> 19:08.310
Only in Cambridge, I think, would you find people mobbed to hear about the letters of a deceased poet.

19:09.150 --> 19:12.434
Well, last week it was absolutely full.

19:12.454 --> 19:13.916
And I'm sure it will be throughout.

19:15.257 --> 19:18.701
When we're talking about books, of course, we are talking about fiction, right?

19:19.762 --> 19:21.063
And the power of fiction.

19:21.103 --> 19:22.485
Perhaps we could talk about that.

19:22.525 --> 19:24.747
I mean, in this country, we have...

19:25.334 --> 19:42.033
I wonder what the concept of fiction is, what your concept of, does it have a purpose beyond, I mean, certainly it must engage and entertain us, I guess, on a certain level, but it has to do with something else, doesn't it, I think, in your view?

19:43.114 --> 19:44.035
I don't know.

19:44.195 --> 19:51.643
I think, I don't think that literature should be determinedly tendentious.

19:52.664 --> 19:54.987
I think it fails then, and then it becomes attractive.

19:56.452 --> 20:08.888
I think that what is tendentious in it should come out of the characters, the place, the time.

20:11.672 --> 20:19.742
The main thing to me about literature is that it should be in some way illuminating, that it should

20:20.802 --> 20:28.609
I expected to tell me something about how people feel and to explain something of the mystery of life to me.

20:29.450 --> 20:34.395
So that there are all kinds of fiction that fit into this.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.438
I see fiction very broadly.

20:37.798 --> 20:47.167
And I don't think that fiction necessarily has a direct purpose other than this.

20:47.187 --> 20:47.367
Really?

20:48.325 --> 21:11.962
When you spoke earlier about a body of fiction coming out of great historical events, you're talking about this merely as the, not merely, but as the material to write according to the way you just described, not as a historical kind of a work to speak for itself.

21:11.982 --> 21:15.447
You see, I think that the history comes there of itself.

21:16.945 --> 21:31.699
If you sit down and write a novel about Cambridge today and what's happening here politically and what's happening perhaps in the... I see big changes in this university.

21:33.941 --> 21:37.805
You don't have to talk about laws.

21:38.145 --> 21:40.548
You don't have to be didactic in any way.

21:41.068 --> 21:46.193
The very way that your characters live and speak will be framed by this.

21:46.426 --> 21:49.610
and will be influenced by the past year.

21:49.630 --> 22:01.484
So the novelist's mandate... It will indeed be a kind of history from within of the years, the early years of the 90s in Cambridge.

22:02.365 --> 22:12.417
I heard a wonderful quotation recently and somebody once asked Nouveau Clapp who, what kind of reader he visualizes and he said,

22:13.173 --> 22:16.056
I look out there and I see a hundred Nabokovs, I guess.

22:18.058 --> 22:20.480
Mainly, I guess he was writing to please himself.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.483
I wonder, do you have a reader?

22:24.184 --> 22:25.545
Is there a reader in mind?

22:25.565 --> 22:26.787
No, I don't think it's fatal.

22:28.228 --> 22:29.169
It's actually fatal.

22:30.611 --> 22:37.457
And sometimes, only in my very first book, because it's the only book of mine that is autobiographical.

22:37.478 --> 22:42.943
My books are all very different, and I'm certainly not there, but in my first book, I have most writers.

22:43.936 --> 22:57.120
And there I was thinking, well, you know, what will my mother think and what kind of effect in the little town where I was born, where I no longer live, what will they think about this?

22:57.140 --> 23:01.729
But since then... Did those concerns, in your view, weaken the book?

23:01.829 --> 23:03.632
I think so, yes.

23:04.051 --> 23:04.672
I think they did.

23:04.812 --> 23:17.748
Because you were concerned about what the leader might— Especially if they thought it was a romanocle and trying to match the names to the characters.

23:19.891 --> 23:21.593
Do you know where it comes from?

23:21.673 --> 23:27.080
I mean, what lights the spark then?

23:28.642 --> 23:33.248
You were a year into this book when the Nobel Prize was awarded.

23:34.038 --> 23:48.339
Did you decide, I guess I'm driving at the genesis of the story, the spark, do you have it pretty much figured out before you start writing it or does it develop, is it a journey for you of discovery?

23:49.621 --> 23:50.903
It develops as it goes along.

23:51.203 --> 24:00.237
It's very difficult for me to say because it's such a subconscious process and it's even difficult to say when you started thinking about it.

24:00.818 --> 24:03.842
For instance, I found when I was looking for something else,

24:04.801 --> 24:08.027
a note of this title in 1989.

24:08.047 --> 24:18.184
So if I wrote down those two lines then, there was something, the theme of this book was somehow beginning.

24:18.945 --> 24:26.438
And isn't that interesting because you start the novel with a, there's an echo, it's a photograph, an old card that she turns over and

24:27.413 --> 24:37.885
Oh, I'm sure she remembers that, but it's almost the same kind of thing, isn't it, where you speak memory, so to speak, and it pops back.

24:39.827 --> 24:42.670
I'm sorry if you're jumping all around here.

24:42.690 --> 24:46.694
Let me just take a second.

24:48.156 --> 24:54.383
You mentioned when we came in that your education is from books.

24:55.021 --> 25:07.134
And I had read the Paris Review interview with you, which was 1980, which I thought was a wonderful interview, that I guess your formal education is really basically non-existent.

25:07.174 --> 25:09.596
No, basically non-existent.

25:09.616 --> 25:13.020
I surely must be the most poorly educated Nobel Prize winner ever.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.222
That's a wonderful quote.

25:15.242 --> 25:20.468
Well then tell me a bit about the education of Nadine Gordemur then.

25:20.488 --> 25:22.750
Well, I went to a convent school.

25:24.232 --> 25:30.038
in the small town where I live.

25:31.360 --> 25:36.445
I went to the University of Witwatersrand for one year, but no degree.

25:37.987 --> 25:42.051
So my education, as I say, really comes from the local public library.

25:43.453 --> 25:44.954
And was it serendipitous?

25:44.974 --> 25:46.936
Was it eclectic?

25:47.337 --> 25:53.243
It began by being serendipitous because I have to say to my mother that she first of all read

25:53.560 --> 25:55.602
to me a lot when I was small.

25:55.682 --> 26:00.166
And then at the age of six, I could be myself, had a passion for books.

26:01.187 --> 26:05.731
She made me a member of the children's section of the public library.

26:05.751 --> 26:13.979
But in that small town, we leave a librarian and soon Nadine wandered off into the other shell.

26:15.000 --> 26:23.027
And I just read whatever took my fancy and had no idea of the incongruity.

26:23.632 --> 26:27.996
so that I would be reading at the age of 11 or something.

26:28.156 --> 26:29.838
I'd still be reading Dr. Doolittle.

26:30.499 --> 26:32.701
Passion of Dr. Doolittle.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.663
But I was also reading Pepys' Diary.

26:36.445 --> 26:38.186
I was dipping into facilities.

26:39.427 --> 26:43.872
For me, this was all just, I was like a little pig encrover.

26:43.892 --> 26:45.714
I love Pepys' Diary.

26:45.914 --> 26:50.578
I went to visit Pepys' Library at Cambridge, by the way.

26:50.618 --> 26:50.879
Did you?

26:50.899 --> 26:53.301
It's in my book.

26:53.602 --> 27:00.592
My book is about the passion for books over 25 centuries back in Alexandria, and just bring it forward.

27:00.873 --> 27:03.897
I was so disappointed when I went to Egypt last year.

27:04.478 --> 27:06.681
I've been to Egypt before, but I've never been to Alexandria.

27:06.701 --> 27:16.015
And of course, there's no feeling, you know, of Forza's wonderful little book and all the things I've read about the oral library at the beginning of time.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.824
They say that there is something down there.

27:18.844 --> 27:26.134
You know, Pergamum now is the rival library to Alexandria, and there is a shell of the library there.

27:27.476 --> 27:27.696
Oh, really?

27:27.716 --> 27:30.640
The passion for books, it's amazing.

27:30.660 --> 27:35.086
And so, was it largely fiction that you read, or everything?

27:35.106 --> 27:42.376
I think it was largely fiction at the beginning, but I think I read quite a lot of travel books because I've never been anywhere.

27:43.998 --> 27:45.580
And I seem to be living...

27:46.370 --> 27:52.698
you know, down at the big toe of the world, miles from the real world.

27:53.319 --> 27:56.603
And at what point did you say, I can do this?

27:57.244 --> 28:01.369
Or was it more of a force saying, I have to do this, I wonder?

28:01.389 --> 28:01.750
No.

28:04.012 --> 28:08.418
My passion as a small child, when I was about 10, was to be a dancer.

28:08.438 --> 28:12.203
I was absolutely determined to be a dancer.

28:12.223 --> 28:16.208
And I think I was a great show-off, because I was also...

28:16.964 --> 28:22.531
and I would mimic my mother's tea party friends after they'd gone and so on.

28:24.032 --> 28:29.199
So there was sort of something going on there and they had to find its right outlet.

28:29.219 --> 28:32.823
But I started writing at the age of about 9, 10, 11.

28:34.064 --> 28:37.909
And I published my first adult story when I was 15.

28:38.089 --> 28:38.470
Wow.

28:39.130 --> 28:40.292
Published?

28:40.312 --> 28:43.756
Yes, in a journal in South Africa.

28:43.796 --> 28:44.777
Tremendous.

28:44.993 --> 28:46.935
I should think so.

28:47.076 --> 28:47.877
No.

28:48.838 --> 28:53.884
And I think I was lucky in that nobody took any particular notice of this.

28:53.904 --> 28:56.768
My parents didn't get all excited and proud of me.

28:56.788 --> 29:00.152
It was just Nadine amusing herself.

29:00.173 --> 29:04.879
It was not regarded as anything that could possibly lead to life's work.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.543
Because in that little town, what did girls do?

29:09.204 --> 29:13.009
Between growing up and getting married, they worked in a shop.

29:13.377 --> 29:21.910
became a typist or they became a music teacher or a dancing teacher or a school teacher and that was it.

29:23.192 --> 29:25.054
There was nothing else.

29:25.074 --> 29:35.089
So that if you didn't fit into those categories to fill in the time between growing up and getting married then you were an oddity.

29:35.109 --> 29:42.861
But from the age of 15 however you continued, you were emboldened to... I was just writing

29:43.398 --> 29:46.741
and writing and writing, you know.

29:46.841 --> 29:52.666
And at some point... I began to be published in little magazines here and there.

29:53.147 --> 29:57.931
And then through that, I got to know other people who wrote.

29:59.092 --> 30:09.941
And by the time that I went to spend that year, I think I was really twenty, at university, then of course my life opened out.

30:09.961 --> 30:11.002
I met other writers.

30:11.563 --> 30:13.084
I met then

30:14.330 --> 30:24.560
young black journalists and aspirin writers like myself, one of whom is now still, we're still friends.

30:24.580 --> 30:43.037
And so along with what interested me, the racial barriers broke down because I had more in common with young blacks who were writing than I had with my contemporaries back in the small town.

30:44.300 --> 30:56.530
If you don't mind my asking a stylistic question without getting into the novel itself, I find it very interesting that you use the dashes and you disdain direct quotes.

30:57.191 --> 30:58.312
Why is that?

30:58.412 --> 31:05.958
I dropped using quotes some years ago because it's a purely visual thing for me.

31:06.559 --> 31:10.402
They seem to me to isolate what people say.

31:10.422 --> 31:14.205
And as you and I are talking now, it's very much a to and fro.

31:14.894 --> 31:20.660
I would see the space between us more or less as a dash between what you say and what I say.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.281
So I started to do that.

31:22.301 --> 31:23.703
And I have to say, I don't notice it.

31:23.883 --> 31:27.607
I mean, after four or five pages, it's... Oh, well, that's good.

31:27.727 --> 31:29.869
I don't notice the absence of the quotations.

31:30.169 --> 31:30.329
No, no.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.011
I really am with the characters.

31:32.031 --> 31:32.551
With the characters.

31:32.571 --> 31:42.201
And I think it really is more incumbent upon you now to really delineate the characterizations of the characters

31:42.805 --> 31:46.289
I mean, they have to be stronger, and I think more recognizable.

31:46.749 --> 31:57.500
Of course, that's one of the... Well, another thing that I started years ago, and that I try to stick to, you may notice I never write He Said, She thing.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.821
But I know that, yeah.

31:58.841 --> 31:59.482
It's part of it.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.143
And I feel it's up to the writer.

32:01.184 --> 32:02.265
That's what I was just saying.

32:02.285 --> 32:04.747
Get the tone of voice so that you know who is speaking.

32:04.767 --> 32:05.288
Precisely.

32:06.229 --> 32:11.614
And as I was reading this book, I'm saying, you know, she's not saying, she said,

32:12.218 --> 32:14.180
he said, but I know who's speaking.

32:14.741 --> 32:17.043
Well, that's what I try for, so I hope it works.

32:17.483 --> 32:20.206
And the voices, of course, capturing that voice.

32:20.226 --> 32:21.467
Do these voices come to you?

32:21.507 --> 32:22.228
Can you hear them?

32:22.248 --> 32:22.328
Yes.

32:23.249 --> 32:23.950
You can hear them.

32:24.090 --> 32:36.242
And it's interesting you say voice, because people say, when you write a novel, how do you know whether it's going to be in the first person or the third person, whether it's going to change tenses?

32:37.744 --> 32:40.707
The answer is that until I hear it,

32:41.767 --> 32:46.793
until it's as if it's been told to me, that's where I'm going to be able to write it.

32:47.494 --> 32:49.236
Otherwise, I haven't found the way to write it.

32:50.578 --> 32:53.361
And do you write in longhand, or do you type?

32:53.381 --> 32:53.781
I type.

32:54.262 --> 32:56.625
I type on a little old Hermes baby.

32:57.646 --> 33:03.834
I haven't gone over to the word process.

33:04.675 --> 33:08.659
I find that I'm a nonfiction writer, that they're essential.

33:09.420 --> 33:09.901
Oh, I'm sure.

33:10.061 --> 33:11.723
And I've got an electronic

33:12.040 --> 33:13.902
typewriter for writing letters and so on.

33:14.943 --> 33:19.088
And maybe I'll get a word processor for that because it's very useful.

33:19.108 --> 33:23.393
Yeah, but I think for writing creatively the way, artistically the way that you do.

33:23.413 --> 33:27.898
But for me it's plugging in facts and moving things around.

33:28.078 --> 33:35.787
But you see, for me, if I have crossed something out and put something else in, a word above, and then cross it out again,

33:36.458 --> 33:38.200
I don't want to lose it.

33:38.521 --> 33:42.265
I want it all there, and to have to print it out each time would be told.

33:42.726 --> 33:46.931
Have you retained all of the variant drafts of your works over the years?

33:47.232 --> 33:49.534
I didn't at the beginning, but I do now.

33:50.416 --> 33:53.640
But I never had more than for a novel.

33:55.061 --> 34:04.373
I would have just the one, the original, and being a clean version.

34:04.859 --> 34:10.386
that I'd go through and make small corrections, but you couldn't really call it a rewrite.

34:10.406 --> 34:11.768
Virtually the first is the end.

34:12.248 --> 34:23.823
I hesitate to use the phrase writer's block, but are you burdened at all, or do you find obstacles in the path, or do you pretty much always know where you're going?

34:23.843 --> 34:27.347
I mean, I know it's not effortless, nothing like that.

34:27.367 --> 34:28.288
No, no, no.

34:28.488 --> 34:34.596
With a novel, I know where I'm going, and I could stop usually one day

34:35.335 --> 34:37.858
virtually with a half sentence or a sentence.

34:38.318 --> 34:38.639
Really?

34:39.159 --> 34:43.204
But it must be the right sentence that I stop at and go back the next day.

34:44.445 --> 35:04.347
I might, and I very often do that when I get deep in the novel, just before I go to bed at night, as if I were reading somebody else's letters, I would steal into the room where I work and I would read over what I've written during the day and I would see things that are not good and I would change, make little changes then.

35:04.546 --> 35:09.693
But Jim, generally when you start the following day, you resume precisely where you left off.

35:09.873 --> 35:10.193
Yes.

35:11.034 --> 35:13.237
Well, that's amazing.

35:13.257 --> 35:21.127
If it doesn't look right, then I might go back and look at the end of the last chapter and see, you know.

35:21.147 --> 35:23.350
And I never do.

35:23.490 --> 35:28.917
I know some writers, I'm amazed that they will write a chapter that's got to come much further on in the book.

35:30.263 --> 35:33.527
and it'll be there, and then when they come to it they'll snap it in.

35:33.547 --> 35:34.268
I couldn't do that.

35:34.408 --> 35:38.693
You have to have page two finished before you go to page three, and so on.

35:38.873 --> 35:44.841
I'm sure you might have noticed in my books, there are what I call sort of invisible stitches.

35:45.001 --> 35:48.946
There are little hints here and there.

35:49.546 --> 35:55.814
For instance, the photograph at the beginning that Vera turns over, the postcard.

35:56.295 --> 35:59.899
Then there's an echo of that which just came.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.801
I like it when that happens.

36:02.362 --> 36:10.490
When the son writes a letter and says he's enclosing a picture of the woman that he's leaving his wife for, but there is no picture.

36:11.951 --> 36:17.917
So there's a kind of picture on the duplicity of... Well, she's circling.

36:17.937 --> 36:18.658
That's amazing.

36:18.678 --> 36:24.543
I mean, you talk about being totally honest, as she was, and he still didn't get the picture.

36:24.643 --> 36:29.548
I mean, get the message, get the picture, and he kept it.

36:30.068 --> 36:36.035
I also read that you once toyed with the idea of being a journalist.

36:36.735 --> 36:47.768
Well, when I was still living in that small town, I was writing, but I was, so to speak, as I was living on my father.

36:47.808 --> 36:50.271
In other words, he was feeding me, wasn't earning anything.

36:51.452 --> 36:56.818
And so I worked for about three months for the local newspaper.

36:58.705 --> 37:01.589
My career there was not illustrious at all.

37:01.609 --> 37:02.210
It's amazing.

37:02.250 --> 37:05.875
I did an interview with Tobias Wolfe a couple weeks ago for Publishers Weekly.

37:05.915 --> 37:08.359
I'm doing interviews now for Publishers Weekly as well.

37:09.561 --> 37:15.169
And he was a reporter after Vietnam for about six months, and he said I was the world's worst reporter.

37:15.189 --> 37:22.860
He said he just doesn't see the two crafts as being even remotely... Well, I don't think they are, but on the other hand, look at Graham Greene.

37:23.060 --> 37:26.265
Well, Graham Greene, but there's a great exception, I think.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.126
Yes, but you know...

37:27.308 --> 37:29.070
And there are... There are others.

37:29.090 --> 37:30.312
Hemingway, yes.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.894
Hemingway had a career as a journalist.

37:31.914 --> 37:33.696
Hemingway, hmm.

37:34.097 --> 37:37.802
Stephen Crane, who wrote some wonderful... Yes, he did.

37:37.822 --> 37:38.783
...journalism.

37:38.903 --> 37:43.148
So, in fact, Virginia Woolf did a lot of reviews.

37:43.189 --> 37:46.132
Virginia Woolf was quite a professional writer.

37:46.192 --> 37:49.737
She was a woman of letters, actually, in the classic sense.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.419
I mean, she did all the different forms.

37:51.840 --> 37:55.965
Now, you've got a substantial body of work, and...

37:56.266 --> 37:58.869
And you've written short stories as well.

37:59.030 --> 38:00.732
Nine volumes, nine collections.

38:00.792 --> 38:01.633
Quite a few, right.

38:02.274 --> 38:10.985
And so how does one decide this is a story and this is the material for a novel?

38:11.005 --> 38:15.430
Well, you know, a story is like an egg.

38:16.592 --> 38:18.815
It comes to me sort of complete.

38:20.357 --> 38:23.901
So that I know where I'm going to begin, I know exactly where I'm going to end.

38:25.083 --> 38:25.463
It's all there.

38:26.202 --> 38:32.170
Whereas a novel is much more spread out, so to speak.

38:32.190 --> 38:40.440
So that in a novel, in my mind, I will know where I'm going to begin and there will be certain key points that I'm going to have to reach.

38:41.001 --> 38:45.647
But how I'm going to get there and what will happen on the way, I don't know.

38:45.667 --> 38:47.289
And it changes as I write it.

38:47.329 --> 38:53.577
And of course a novel, it's one of the very few exercises professionally

38:54.603 --> 39:00.590
where you start something knowing full well that nobody's going to have anything to say about it for two or three or four years.

39:01.611 --> 39:05.175
And whether or not it succeeds, of course, that's another story, too.

39:05.455 --> 39:15.507
A friend of mine who is a musician and also a writer, a jazz musician, he said, you know, the thing about jazz, or any kind of... I said, you get your applause immediately.

39:16.368 --> 39:23.496
I mean, you know, if you're good and you're communicating, and I suppose as a stage actor as well,

39:24.202 --> 39:28.229
the response is immediate, but you don't get that as a writer.

39:28.269 --> 39:30.533
And then there's this period of anxiety.

39:31.514 --> 39:36.122
Do you have any postpartum anxiety when a book is completed?

39:36.643 --> 39:44.276
No, when the book is completed, there always must be something else you're going to do.

39:45.458 --> 39:48.403
Otherwise, you know,

39:49.177 --> 39:54.223
You have been with it for so long that you're just going to fall into some kind of depression.

39:54.484 --> 39:57.908
This is very common with writers.

39:57.928 --> 40:01.592
So there must be something waiting that you can wind down with.

40:02.253 --> 40:06.899
That's where I would be writing a story very likely.

40:08.341 --> 40:15.049
In this case, it's unusual this year because this year I knew that when I finished that novel

40:15.451 --> 40:22.341
toward the end of last year, that in January I had to start reading for and writing these lectures.

40:23.723 --> 40:29.852
But I feel I haven't worked now the whole of this year because I haven't written anything in Manchester.

40:30.734 --> 40:31.074
Really?

40:31.315 --> 40:33.999
So you spent the whole year really preparing these lectures?

40:34.019 --> 40:43.112
Yes, and then of course there was a big and joyful interruption of the elections and all the things that happened at home.

40:43.632 --> 40:46.536
And that must have been quite, can you just give me a comment on that?

40:46.556 --> 40:51.624
It's apart from the writing, but to have lived with that moment of your life.

40:51.704 --> 40:53.026
It really was wonderful.

40:53.707 --> 41:01.058
I'm a member of the African National Congress, and I belong to a local branch.

41:02.119 --> 41:07.547
And our branch, like every other branch in every other political organization,

41:08.624 --> 41:22.481
asked for people to be so-called agents who would be on duty in a polling station to see that people who were semi-literate were not persuaded by others to put their eggs wherever.

41:24.163 --> 41:36.037
So that I had a remarkable day, day and a half, in a polling station seeing the different people coming in.

41:36.057 --> 41:38.260
It was in a church

41:38.442 --> 41:47.951
quite near where I live in a white suburb, now with a few black people living there, for many many years only a white suburb.

41:48.952 --> 42:05.867
And to see people who were domestic servants, middle class white people, businessmen coming in for work, well dressed women,

42:07.113 --> 42:23.448
cleaners, black cleaners from the university which is down the road, a complete mixture of every stage in society because this was not an election where it was proportional representation, so you could vote anywhere.

42:24.529 --> 42:28.292
Indeed, some people went, some white people went to Soweto to vote.

42:28.312 --> 42:35.078
But to see this real mixture of South Africans who before had been so divided by

42:35.378 --> 42:59.173
the lack of rights for some and the largesse of rights for the others and the kind of awe, the solemnity with which many black people came in to perform what to everybody else in the rest of the world is really, you know, something that they don't even bother to go about half the day.

42:59.894 --> 43:04.761
I mean, a good turnout here is, you know, a great turnout is 50%.

43:05.433 --> 43:09.237
I mean, we're having a primary election in about two weeks.

43:09.317 --> 43:10.198
I'll be amazed.

43:10.218 --> 43:13.021
Well, the Kennedy race will bring out a lot of people.

43:13.401 --> 43:13.741
A lot of people.

43:13.761 --> 43:18.086
That's amazing that they would even consider putting this guy out.

43:18.106 --> 43:19.327
It's an amazement to me.

43:19.647 --> 43:25.794
If we lose him in the Senate, we should be ashamed of ourselves.

43:25.814 --> 43:27.896
You mean if this Chuck Romney gets him?

43:28.216 --> 43:29.137
Yes, it's dead even.

43:29.437 --> 43:31.980
I mean, he has a very good chance of

43:32.348 --> 43:35.391
And such a dirty campaign, actually, on TV.

43:35.452 --> 43:36.933
It's really terrible.

43:36.953 --> 43:38.695
Well, that's beside the point.

43:38.715 --> 43:46.124
He's a kid, and he's attacking the man's record, and the man's record on social issues is spectacular.

43:46.304 --> 43:47.966
And he does so much for the state.

43:49.788 --> 43:51.770
And he's very good on foreign policy, too.

43:51.790 --> 43:53.252
He's been a wonderful friend to us.

43:53.292 --> 43:57.557
My wife's a clinical social worker, and she has helped people.

43:57.617 --> 44:00.600
And I mean, if you have a problem with

44:00.850 --> 44:03.413
a client who's having trouble getting into a nursing home.

44:03.474 --> 44:08.460
This one person is, you call his office and they respond immediately.

44:08.641 --> 44:16.872
I mean, she said, I cannot tell you how many times if we've had a problem, we call Senator Kennedy's office and they take care of it.

44:17.813 --> 44:20.377
And she said, my wife deals, she's outraged.

44:20.797 --> 44:23.841
She said, if we lose that man, she's going to be very, very upset.

44:24.142 --> 44:28.107
I don't mean to go off onto that tangent, but talking about, again,

44:28.340 --> 44:31.024
What, for you, is more satisfying creatively?

44:31.124 --> 44:42.602
I mean, obviously the novel, but do you use stories as a tune-up, or as a change of pace, or is it just responding to different creative stimuli, I wonder?

44:43.403 --> 44:44.865
It's difficult to say.

44:44.885 --> 44:53.158
I love reading short stories, and I love writing, because, you know, there's a great satisfaction in... But are they confections, then, when you say that?

44:53.178 --> 44:56.423
Are they confections for you, or are they actually... No, no, they are.

44:56.723 --> 44:58.605
You know, they're serious work.

44:59.345 --> 45:00.767
And of course they're very tight.

45:02.048 --> 45:08.234
They're very convinced that the challenge, I mean, in a novel, you know, you've got space.

45:10.536 --> 45:16.542
But it's difficult, really.

45:16.562 --> 45:20.386
I find... I just want to make sure you've done this.

45:21.947 --> 45:25.110
I find, alas, that whereas I used to have so many

45:25.529 --> 45:26.671
ideas for stories.

45:26.691 --> 45:30.878
When I finished a novel I'd have three or four lined up that speak.

45:32.500 --> 45:41.314
So now as I've got older I seem to have less ideas for short stories, fewer ideas for short stories.

45:42.196 --> 45:49.307
And I move more and more towards novels, to the complexities of novels.

45:50.369 --> 45:52.212
At the moment now

45:53.018 --> 45:55.600
since I finished that and while I was doing the lectures.

45:56.501 --> 46:02.847
I've just got one little note in my mind that will probably be a long story.

46:03.888 --> 46:09.994
Do you hope, when people come to your work, do you want them to look at it as a corpus?

46:10.314 --> 46:13.477
Is everything in your mind related one to the other?

46:14.058 --> 46:15.179
Yes, I do.

46:15.299 --> 46:19.343
Of course, that's an ambitious expectation.

46:19.363 --> 46:21.405
But for me,

46:21.672 --> 46:25.277
Everything that every writer writes, it's really all one book.

46:26.779 --> 46:39.896
You're constantly growing in yourself and your society and your life is changing and there's a tension between these two things that produces the work.

46:40.877 --> 46:48.827
But if you look at most writers, they return to the same themes in a different way with a different set of characters.

46:50.275 --> 46:53.400
And I can see that in my own work.

46:53.701 --> 47:00.813
You think you've written all you know about this or that, these people, in a certain situation.

47:01.554 --> 47:06.984
And then afterwards, it's as if you walked around and saw it from the other side.

47:10.169 --> 47:15.979
I read a quotation from you in another interview where you said you write to make sense of your own life.

47:16.533 --> 47:18.275
I love that quote.

47:18.396 --> 47:20.739
It's true, I think.

47:21.079 --> 47:23.302
I understand that.

47:23.322 --> 47:31.473
It's a continual process, then, with all of these books that you've written, to explore further for yourself.

47:31.493 --> 47:36.440
I was brought up without any religion.

47:40.305 --> 47:42.488
What is religion, really?

47:42.508 --> 47:44.110
It's an explanation, isn't it?

47:44.360 --> 47:50.287
on the purpose in life while we are here, and even what would happen to us afterwards.

47:51.128 --> 47:54.111
But I was brought up with outset.

47:55.993 --> 48:06.024
So it may be that when I first began to write, I was looking for a meaning in the structure, because it was not a ready-made one.

48:06.044 --> 48:07.666
Well, have you found a purpose?

48:08.186 --> 48:10.549
Have you found the answer to your purpose?

48:10.990 --> 48:13.152
I suppose writing is my answer.

48:13.520 --> 48:16.624
I'm still in the process of discovery.

48:16.904 --> 48:28.780
And writing is something, I'm sure, that you expect to do... Oh, yes, as long as I live and don't turn gaga.

48:29.401 --> 48:32.265
And you never get bored with it, I assume.

48:34.247 --> 48:40.135
I don't think... Because, you know, writing is so much self-discipline, isn't it?

48:41.465 --> 48:44.628
Nobody tells you you've got to.

48:46.370 --> 48:50.415
And they'll even understand if you say, I'm going to take a day off.

48:51.216 --> 48:52.797
Yes, but why doesn't one?

48:52.817 --> 48:53.718
And I don't know why.

48:53.738 --> 48:59.385
You seem to be your own boss in a very strict way.

49:01.066 --> 49:09.936
I really am not myself if I'm a long time without life.

49:10.388 --> 49:12.992
Now, is this more or less... I could take a brief holiday.

49:13.012 --> 49:16.998
But, I mean, is this... I mean, Trollope could never pass a day without working.

49:17.118 --> 49:20.203
I mean, the man was... No, I can pass a day.

49:20.403 --> 49:26.452
You know, if I'm doing something else, it must be a kind of... John Kenneth Galbraith is that way here in Cambridge, too.

49:26.472 --> 49:31.560
I mean, the man is... Well, at home, when I'm working, I work every day.

49:32.321 --> 49:34.485
Saturdays, Sundays, it's all the same to me.

49:35.807 --> 49:38.691
Any favourites among the books, or are you always...

49:39.042 --> 49:40.323
most pleased with the one?

49:41.024 --> 49:41.985
No, not always.

49:42.646 --> 49:51.535
You know, there is some, I don't necessarily know whether they're the better books or the best books, but did you have for all sorts of private reasons more of a feeling for?

49:53.256 --> 50:04.588
An old book of mine called The Guest of Honor is a book that I have a strong feeling for.

50:06.270 --> 50:08.492
Then there is

50:09.907 --> 50:21.425
The Conservationist, which was technically a challenge, which I think I managed to bring off, and it's my most lyrical book.

50:21.445 --> 50:24.049
I've got a feeling for that.

50:24.069 --> 50:26.874
And Berger's Daughter.

50:26.914 --> 50:30.800
Of course, that book was banned in your country for many years.

50:31.260 --> 50:32.142
That book was banned.

50:32.162 --> 50:38.091
That was banned only for about six months, but two previous ones, one was banned for ten and one for twelve years.

50:38.425 --> 50:41.228
such history now according that it happened.

50:41.248 --> 50:42.409
Amazing.

50:42.429 --> 50:46.113
And to look at the books now, can you understand why they were banned?

50:47.074 --> 50:51.659
Well, you have to look at the crazy laws of the time, then you can understand.

50:51.779 --> 50:57.105
And to go back to the events of this year, did you expect to see anything like this in your lifetime?

50:58.406 --> 51:05.033
Well, in the last couple of years, one could believe it was going to happen, you know, while the negotiations were going on.

51:05.153 --> 51:07.656
Once de Klerk and Mandela sat down together.

51:08.446 --> 51:11.790
But then there were so many itches on the way.

51:12.291 --> 51:17.677
Negotiations broke and started again and broke again and started again.

51:18.638 --> 51:23.264
But what we feared was violence over the elections.

51:23.284 --> 51:26.808
And of course the elections were unbelievable.

51:26.828 --> 51:29.672
There was such an atmosphere of peace.

51:29.692 --> 51:32.175
I think my hour is about up.
