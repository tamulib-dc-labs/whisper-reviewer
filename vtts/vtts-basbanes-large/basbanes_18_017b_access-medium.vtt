00:02.258 --> 00:03.199
Okay, it's rolling.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.842
Well, glad to speak with you.

00:06.422 --> 00:07.624
Congratulations on your new book.

00:07.944 --> 00:08.284
Thank you.

00:08.885 --> 00:14.030
And, gee, I guess, I mean, where does one start?

00:18.294 --> 00:21.598
I always like to meet people face-to-face, I have to admit.

00:22.799 --> 00:26.723
But in any case, I mean, do you believe that you've invented a genre?

00:26.743 --> 00:27.864
Let's start with that.

00:28.325 --> 00:30.527
I mean, is this a...

00:30.929 --> 00:32.932
A creature of your creation.

00:34.874 --> 00:39.060
You know, the comic mystery.

00:40.122 --> 00:42.385
I'm really trying to think of anybody else who tests them.

00:43.687 --> 00:53.460
I think... Well, I think that what I've done is sort of moved...

00:54.554 --> 00:59.860
a thing that existed in the movies when I was a kid and started from that.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.651
It was a kind of mystery comedy in the movies, which I don't think existed in books.

01:11.875 --> 01:22.367
Red Skelton did them, Bob Hope did them, a lot of people did them, in which a fumble-footed amateur

01:23.225 --> 01:34.320
gets completely surrounded by mob guys, or spies, or stuff like that, and struggles through to success.

01:35.862 --> 01:49.941
And, you know, Bob Hoven, my favorite brunette, and my favorite spy, and Fred Skelton with the good humor man, and I know there were some others, I can't think of them now.

01:50.326 --> 01:51.628
Not on purpose.

01:51.668 --> 01:53.410
It was sort of looking back afterwards.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.432
I said, oh, so that's where I got it.

01:58.536 --> 02:01.820
When this fog of comedy came over me.

02:02.781 --> 02:03.663
What did you call it, fog?

02:04.303 --> 02:05.985
Yes.

02:06.025 --> 02:06.746
That's fine.

02:06.786 --> 02:10.090
I'm just saving myself some trouble when it comes to transcription, that's all.

02:11.552 --> 02:16.198
Because I began as, you know, just doing it right, you know, doing things.

02:16.685 --> 02:20.889
whodunits and... But conceiving of an actual mystery, of course.

02:21.249 --> 02:21.349
Yeah.

02:21.369 --> 02:27.374
Because this is what, you know, you won all these Golden Dagger Awards and Edgar Awards.

02:27.474 --> 02:29.696
You certainly are abiding by the conventions.

02:30.377 --> 02:31.558
Yes, yes.

02:31.858 --> 02:41.806
Well, I'm sort of... I'm sort of within the conventions while sticking pins in them at the same time.

02:41.826 --> 02:46.270
You know, I don't go off on my own, but...

02:47.313 --> 02:52.520
But for the first few years I was writing, there was nothing comic.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.506
I was just doing books like anybody else.

02:57.227 --> 03:15.852
And then when it happened that what I was doing was sort of playing off the inevitable scenes, what emerged was a kind of novel version of what those movies used to do.

03:16.321 --> 03:20.326
And now I think it's sort of moved beyond that, but that's where it all began.

03:20.346 --> 03:24.512
And now, I don't know.

03:24.532 --> 03:32.722
I mean, you certainly have written, as I know, for the films, for the movies, and have, in fact, even been honored for your contributions.

03:33.223 --> 03:36.868
Do you see these things visually when you're writing them?

03:37.028 --> 03:37.709
Pretty much.

03:37.889 --> 03:40.973
Yeah, I'm kind of a visual writer.

03:43.777 --> 03:44.117
Yeah.

03:44.722 --> 03:46.306
Visual and sound effects.

03:47.669 --> 03:48.551
Yeah.

03:48.591 --> 03:50.816
This thing could easily, this isn't going to be hard.

03:51.136 --> 03:56.067
I mean, if somebody wants to do a movie, it's not going to be too hard to put this thing together, is it?

03:56.248 --> 04:02.241
Well, the problem that I create, though, is I put, I give it too much story and

04:02.508 --> 04:04.391
and too many events and too many characters.

04:04.471 --> 04:05.732
That's never stopped Hollywood.

04:05.933 --> 04:06.774
Yeah.

04:06.794 --> 04:07.875
Well, yeah, I know.

04:07.895 --> 04:08.997
They can do War and Peace.

04:09.077 --> 04:10.279
They can do Anna Karenina.

04:10.299 --> 04:13.323
I'm teasing now.

04:13.363 --> 04:14.644
Sorry.

04:14.664 --> 04:17.468
Go ahead.

04:17.488 --> 04:18.370
Yeah, I wouldn't do it.

04:18.430 --> 04:19.411
I wouldn't adapt my own.

04:19.751 --> 04:20.012
Really?

04:20.673 --> 04:20.853
Yeah.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.798
That's... That way madness lies.

04:24.818 --> 04:25.039
Yeah.

04:25.679 --> 04:28.403
But, of course, you are writing satire, too, I think.

04:28.483 --> 04:32.008
I mean, there are a number of... If you're trying to say...

04:33.473 --> 04:35.935
Well, do you accept that you're a genre writer?

04:37.256 --> 04:39.338
Yes, yes.

04:39.358 --> 04:40.059
It doesn't bother you.

04:40.079 --> 04:45.984
You don't rail at the wind and say, they call me a genre writer or anything.

04:46.004 --> 04:47.186
They don't take me seriously.

04:48.807 --> 04:52.831
Well... I mean, they do take you seriously, but you don't say that they don't.

04:53.331 --> 05:00.358
I did rail at... I mean, I think everybody in this genre rails and says, oh, come on.

05:01.278 --> 05:02.940
But...

05:04.068 --> 05:07.791
two things kind of conspired to stop me from railing.

05:10.014 --> 05:11.635
One is, well, here I am.

05:11.695 --> 05:16.359
I mean, there's no point, you know, if I'm wearing a purple coat, I can't deny it.

05:16.940 --> 05:23.646
And the other thing is that... Good quote, by the way.

05:23.666 --> 05:25.968
I can see... You can see things visually and in sound.

05:25.988 --> 05:27.430
I can see them in type.

05:30.473 --> 05:32.995
But the other thing is that if you...

05:34.004 --> 05:45.035
think about it, the novel, the whole genre of novel, I mean, never mind subgenres within it, but the whole art form.

05:46.256 --> 05:47.938
There's a phrase I'm not going to hear.

05:48.198 --> 05:49.960
I'm not going to say a lot.

05:51.542 --> 05:51.822
Why?

05:51.882 --> 05:59.910
Anyway, the whole novel form is itself less important.

06:00.481 --> 06:01.162
than it was.

06:01.842 --> 06:06.787
There's less prestige to claim that you aren't getting.

06:07.688 --> 06:21.721
You know, I mean, when Fitzgerald and Faulkner and Hemingway were writing, something that they did would be front page news.

06:23.563 --> 06:27.046
There is no writer today who is front page news.

06:27.066 --> 06:28.227
So at that time,

06:29.236 --> 06:43.191
a Dashiell Hammett, who is certainly their peer, would have a legitimate complaint saying just because some of my characters have guns in their hands and they're not shooting at animals doesn't mean I'm a lesser writer.

06:43.572 --> 06:53.843
But today, I wouldn't really feel all that badly to be told that I wasn't thought of as highly as John Irving or

06:54.869 --> 06:56.010
What's that guy, Cormac?

06:56.551 --> 06:57.592
Cormac McCarthy.

06:57.732 --> 07:00.055
I just interviewed John Irving last week, by the way.

07:00.936 --> 07:04.721
I went up to Vermont to this palatial mansion on the mountainside.

07:04.741 --> 07:07.845
I mean, he has a house halfway up a mountain.

07:09.066 --> 07:10.588
It was not bad.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.211
It was pretty nice.

07:13.732 --> 07:15.434
We'll have garb rot.

07:16.735 --> 07:17.516
Anyway, I'm sorry.

07:17.957 --> 07:20.640
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, there's the...

07:22.342 --> 07:27.150
The prestige isn't there for anybody anymore, so why carry on?

07:27.170 --> 07:32.739
I know people who still do carry on, but I don't think there's... I am light of heart about it.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.682
Tell me a couple of things now.

07:34.782 --> 07:39.249
I mean, you didn't start writing this June 13th after O.J.

07:39.269 --> 07:39.810
was arrested.

07:40.050 --> 07:42.755
You didn't bang this thing out in six weeks.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.119
No, no.

07:45.139 --> 07:48.484
I would have kept both gloves in the same place.

07:49.426 --> 07:51.169
Good point.

07:52.351 --> 08:02.448
I mean, it is rather, you talk about celebrities going on trial for murder, you know, and then you think back, how many of them have there been?

08:02.468 --> 08:03.069
I know.

08:03.490 --> 08:09.139
We've been trying to figure that out, and I think that this Simpson thing, somebody...

08:09.389 --> 08:10.450
You know, there's two things.

08:10.470 --> 08:19.419
There's somebody who becomes famous because they're on trial for murder, but somebody who was famous prior to that, I think you have to go back to Fatty Arbuckle.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.743
See, I mean, that doesn't resonate with me.

08:22.763 --> 08:29.429
I mean, I guess I know the case, but it certainly... They'll be talking about this one long after we're gone.

08:29.449 --> 08:34.895
I mean, this Simpson thing is... Fatty Arbuckle was a silent movie star, so that means it's, you know... Yeah, he was big.

08:35.235 --> 08:35.916
Early 20s.

08:36.677 --> 08:37.017
So...

08:37.537 --> 08:38.819
Did he do it, by the way?

08:39.119 --> 08:39.339
Pardon?

08:39.419 --> 08:39.980
Did he do it?

08:41.221 --> 08:41.562
No.

08:41.902 --> 08:42.443
He got off?

08:42.843 --> 08:43.284
No, no, no.

08:43.384 --> 08:43.724
He didn't.

08:43.925 --> 08:45.246
Well, let's see.

08:45.266 --> 08:46.748
His career was ruined.

08:50.452 --> 08:52.134
I think it all wound up sort of in a mess.

08:52.154 --> 08:58.121
I'm not sure he was finally convicted of murdering the girl.

08:58.802 --> 09:01.165
A crime of passion?

09:02.444 --> 09:06.010
Oh, well, if... Yeah, but I'm picking your brains here.

09:06.030 --> 09:07.091
You brought this up.

09:07.352 --> 09:08.594
It certainly isn't that famous.

09:09.816 --> 09:28.165
Well, what happened was that there was some sort of strange party, I mean, a rough party in a hotel in San Francisco, and Arbuckle was there, and...

09:28.685 --> 09:38.898
It was said that this girl, who's a not very successful actress, died because a Coke bottle that was inside her at the time broke.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.100
Oh, Jesus.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.205
So he was accused of inserting it.

09:45.066 --> 09:48.631
And he said he never did, and he didn't even know she was there, and she was in a different room.

09:48.651 --> 09:50.673
He didn't know he was inserting the Coke bottle?

09:51.274 --> 09:53.777
I mean, she didn't know she was there.

09:54.358 --> 09:54.979
No.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.193
Well, there was a certain amount of drugs involved.

09:57.213 --> 09:58.394
I guess, yeah.

09:58.755 --> 10:02.420
Anyway, okay, well, anyway, that's irrelevant, I guess.

10:02.440 --> 10:09.790
At that time, because of the sexual nature of the charges, once the man was charged, he was doomed.

10:09.810 --> 10:14.196
It really didn't matter if he was guilty or innocent or found guilty or innocent.

10:14.216 --> 10:15.218
His career was over.

10:15.338 --> 10:19.864
He went from being the most loved man in America to the most hated man in America.

10:20.765 --> 10:21.967
But anyway, that was the last time.

10:22.147 --> 10:23.129
That was the last time.

10:23.149 --> 10:24.190
70 years, and

10:24.777 --> 10:31.865
So then I do it, and before I can get the book out, you know.

10:32.406 --> 10:33.727
Yeah, but it can't hurt you, I don't think.

10:34.548 --> 10:36.330
No, it's just so bizarre.

10:36.410 --> 10:41.896
It's not a coattail I would have written on on purpose.

10:42.577 --> 10:42.937
No, I quite agree.

10:42.957 --> 10:43.758
It's very strange.

10:43.979 --> 10:50.105
But they sure have it in the publicity letter they sent out, though.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.448
Well, you know.

10:52.468 --> 10:54.210
Sidney Flacco.

10:55.591 --> 10:58.816
Well, listen, you went out to the country music capital.

10:58.836 --> 11:01.440
Now, this is kind of a big deal for you, isn't it?

11:01.460 --> 11:06.367
I mean, you're basically, this is new territory for you, isn't it?

11:06.668 --> 11:07.790
Yeah, yeah.

11:08.110 --> 11:19.287
Well, yes, but to deal with country music performers and fans, yeah, that's, you know, but the...

11:20.245 --> 11:25.073
Because this is, in a way, it's a sequel to a previous book.

11:25.093 --> 11:26.114
It's not a series.

11:27.497 --> 11:28.719
I certainly hope it's not a series.

11:29.660 --> 11:32.805
But you couldn't let those characters go, could you?

11:33.566 --> 11:34.347
I guess not.

11:34.568 --> 11:42.000
And when I found out about Branson, they seemed like the people to go there.

11:42.020 --> 11:45.726
Because after we went to Branson, my wife called it an irony-free zone.

11:46.988 --> 11:47.248
And...

11:47.684 --> 11:50.650
It just seemed like... I've never heard of a place before, to be honest with you.

11:51.271 --> 11:52.673
It's an amazing place.

11:52.694 --> 11:56.120
3,500 population, 5 million visitors a year.

11:56.280 --> 11:56.601
Jeez.

11:56.801 --> 11:57.563
And no airport.

11:59.326 --> 12:01.630
And, I mean, they're all like making a pilgrimage, right?

12:02.272 --> 12:04.776
Well, they're making a pilgrimage to their past, is what it is.

12:04.837 --> 12:10.367
The people who play there...

12:11.140 --> 12:20.432
are not the hot new ones who are going to come out with a new song or a new record or a new album or a new event any minute now.

12:20.533 --> 12:26.541
They're people whose careers have closed in a funny way.

12:26.761 --> 12:29.565
So they come out and they do their greatest hits.

12:29.585 --> 12:32.409
So it's not like the minor league training ground so much.

12:32.489 --> 12:35.953
It's almost like the old elephant burial ground.

12:36.013 --> 12:38.717
It has been...

12:39.085 --> 12:41.509
has been City.

12:42.530 --> 12:48.198
There was one guy I was talking to there who's very talented and very funny and very nice.

12:48.218 --> 12:50.762
This guy named Jim Stafford.

12:51.002 --> 12:56.250
About 20 years ago, he hit one hit called Spiders and Snakes.

12:56.855 --> 12:59.459
Doesn't do anything for me.

12:59.759 --> 13:00.540
No, I never heard of him.

13:01.141 --> 13:06.169
Well, when I talked to him, he had an 800-seat theater and he was filling it twice a day.

13:06.209 --> 13:11.216
And he has now moved to a bigger theater.

13:11.296 --> 13:13.840
So how do you decide to set a novel there?

13:15.342 --> 13:25.157
Well, when I heard about it and then went and looked at it, I love to put absolutely disparate...

13:26.285 --> 13:55.971
elements together if you put real opposites together you can sometimes get a nice atomic explosion out of it and one of the contrasts has always been and this is a link because the previous book about those people was sort of a National Enquirer takeoff thing and there the contrast between

13:56.812 --> 14:21.037
the people on the paper, the absolutely cynical, heartless, funny, bright, horrible, terrific people on the paper, and the very slow, simple, naive, one-dimensional, sweet members of the audience.

14:21.838 --> 14:23.399
Couldn't be more of a contrast.

14:24.901 --> 14:26.042
And...

14:27.777 --> 14:38.013
And there's something of that in Branson, too, because the stars, the headliners, their active career may be over, you know, but they're still around.

14:38.053 --> 14:38.834
They have their hits.

14:38.854 --> 14:40.136
They have their past glory.

14:40.677 --> 14:49.530
And these people, these five million people a year, they come there to be reminded of something they liked in the past, and they get to like it again.

14:49.590 --> 14:52.455
Is it all year round, or is it just like a season of chicken?

14:53.616 --> 14:56.080
It's sort of growing.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.957
It had gotten up to about six, seven months a year.

15:00.779 --> 15:03.603
Now it's... Let me see.

15:03.623 --> 15:13.496
I think they shut down November and most of December, and now they're picking up again over the Christmas holidays, and then they shut down again until the end of April.

15:13.817 --> 15:17.021
Now, you, as I understand, it spent, what, about five weeks there?

15:17.882 --> 15:18.623
Not quite.

15:18.664 --> 15:21.207
No, I was there three times...

15:21.878 --> 15:24.163
for about a total of about three weeks as well.

15:24.403 --> 15:27.569
And this was largely field research, I gather.

15:27.589 --> 15:28.331
Yeah, yeah.

15:28.872 --> 15:36.327
For ambience and atmosphere and... And I talked with a lot of people, and I talked with some of the

15:36.762 --> 15:41.048
show people, and things like the Ozark Marketing Council.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.072
The Ozark Marketing Council.

15:44.092 --> 15:46.515
Yes, they market the Ozark.

15:47.617 --> 15:56.769
And I went over to the county seat at Forsyth, and I talked to an attorney there who used to be the prosecutor.

15:58.051 --> 16:04.660
And, in fact, there was one thing he told me that I neglected to get into the book.

16:04.808 --> 16:06.550
And now it's too late, and I'm sorry.

16:06.811 --> 16:08.313
And what was that?

16:09.034 --> 16:22.252
Murder trials in Missouri are much shorter than they are in the rest of the world, and that's because the state law requires the attorneys to state their charges ahead of time.

16:24.115 --> 16:24.736
What do you mean?

16:24.756 --> 16:26.378
I mean, you have to do that anyway, don't you?

16:26.813 --> 16:29.536
When you, maybe I'm not understanding.

16:31.118 --> 16:34.202
I mean, when you indict somebody, you state your charges, right?

16:34.222 --> 16:34.682
No, no, no, no.

16:34.803 --> 16:36.845
I mean, the lawyer's, I'm sorry, the lawyer's fees.

16:37.666 --> 16:40.289
Oh, I thought you were talking about the indictment.

16:40.309 --> 16:41.450
No, I didn't mean the criminal charges.

16:41.471 --> 16:42.332
I meant the lawyer's fees.

16:42.352 --> 16:42.932
Oh, the fees.

16:43.293 --> 16:48.098
The lawyer has to say how much his fee is going to be at the beginning, before the trial.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.420
So it's a package deal.

16:49.660 --> 16:50.101
Yeah.

16:50.121 --> 16:51.863
Regardless of how much time it takes.

16:52.484 --> 16:55.988
So it's slam-bam, thank you, ma'am type thing, right?

16:56.008 --> 16:56.128
Right.

16:56.108 --> 17:01.776
A murder trial in Missouri that goes into the second week is a really complex murder trial.

17:03.078 --> 17:11.129
If Shapiro had to say to Simpson, this is going to cost you $4 million, this would be a shorter trial in California.

17:11.289 --> 17:11.490
No.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.175
I think what he told Simpson is how much, first he said, how much are you worth?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.518
And they said $10 million, right?

17:17.638 --> 17:18.059
Yeah.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.963
And that's what it's going to cost.

17:20.983 --> 17:21.103
Right.

17:21.792 --> 17:23.075
I mean, that's it.

17:23.736 --> 17:25.660
That's what happens to the Menendez brothers, right?

17:26.181 --> 17:28.586
The 12 million is gone, so she's gone, too.

17:30.369 --> 17:34.217
Leslie Abramson, the next thing she did was start a fund.

17:34.978 --> 17:37.844
Like, we really care about the goddamn Menendez brothers.

17:38.646 --> 17:39.106
Jesus.

17:40.249 --> 17:41.952
Especially those of us with children, you know?

17:42.734 --> 17:43.395
Parents.

17:45.873 --> 17:49.259
Look at your kids a little different.

17:49.399 --> 17:55.389
But I'll tell you, I have to confess, I can't miss a minute of this O.J.

17:55.409 --> 17:55.990
Simpson thing.

17:56.891 --> 17:58.193
I mean, I admit it.

17:58.253 --> 17:59.015
I have to watch it.

18:01.098 --> 18:04.183
It is at that wonderful story level.

18:06.928 --> 18:10.834
From the beginning, it has been exactly like an old...

18:11.793 --> 18:17.382
Adele paperback mystery novel with the crime map on the back cover.

18:17.582 --> 18:18.083
Exactly.

18:19.365 --> 18:27.959
I've always maintained as an old reporter, you know, I mean, there's nothing beats going to a trial and sitting in day after day.

18:27.979 --> 18:32.907
I mean, I really have the temperament to sit through a whole trial and follow it.

18:33.359 --> 18:57.223
um so i mean this is you know i have covered quite a few trials in my life and it is it is interesting i mean i and i think people are really sucking this up too you know yeah it pretty well has everything yeah um of course you've got you've got the country music and then and then you've got the tabloids which are infecting our lives at a yes at a uh

18:57.710 --> 19:02.675
tremendous pace, and I guess you felt you weren't done with them yet, huh?

19:02.695 --> 19:03.837
Well, I thought I was.

19:04.477 --> 19:21.977
When I finished the first book, I got my hero and heroine out of there and gave them a nice, semi-respectable job on New York Magazine, and so I thought that I've done a lot of books where that was the end of it.

19:21.997 --> 19:27.683
I never saw those characters again, but somehow the

19:28.237 --> 19:33.526
the sweet simplicity of Branson.

19:33.546 --> 19:38.855
You know, Mel Tillis described Branson as being a cross between Vegas and Mayberry.

19:40.118 --> 19:41.941
And that's perfect.

19:43.443 --> 19:50.636
And to put that crowd of people from the galaxy in there.

19:51.117 --> 19:53.721
But then the other thing, once I got started in it,

19:55.388 --> 20:11.051
I got more and more interested in the performers, and there was a piece on 60 Minutes about four years ago, four or five years ago, that Ed Bradley did, and I got a hold of that and watched it.

20:12.854 --> 20:18.663
And a bunch of these guys all play golf together on Wednesday mornings.

20:19.604 --> 20:24.872
This is true retirement village for them, and they love it.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.942
they get to play golf in the morning.

20:26.962 --> 20:29.606
They don't have to get in a goddamn bus and go to another town.

20:29.646 --> 20:36.936
Uh, they, they perform twice a day, afternoon and early evening.

20:37.196 --> 20:42.984
You know, by nine 30, they can have their, their, uh, warm cocoa and go to bed.

20:43.104 --> 20:45.428
You know, they're having a good time.

20:45.448 --> 20:48.412
So anyway, Bradley went out on a, on a golf course with them.

20:49.553 --> 20:51.636
And, uh,

20:52.342 --> 20:58.589
At one point he said, how is this recession that's striking America affecting you?

20:59.069 --> 21:05.356
And they grinned at each other and they grinned at him and they said, what?

21:05.376 --> 21:05.897
He said, yeah, I know.

21:06.438 --> 21:11.003
And, okay, these are not shit kickers.

21:11.043 --> 21:13.045
These are not roofs.

21:13.185 --> 21:20.273
These are very sharp, talented people.

21:21.215 --> 21:24.019
clever people, men and women.

21:24.880 --> 21:43.406
And that became, from the very beginning, that became a part of what the book was about, that the guy, Ray Jones, my country singer guy, would be the sharpest guy in the book, you know, except for my girl Sarah.

21:43.426 --> 21:49.534
But he would be dubious and imaginative and sharp and

21:49.987 --> 21:54.799
and let everybody else underestimate him.

21:55.572 --> 21:58.776
That was fun to do that, to find a real hero there.

21:59.117 --> 21:59.377
Yeah.

22:00.158 --> 22:02.621
Describe your world for me.

22:02.641 --> 22:05.445
I mean, your characters do seem to come.

22:06.266 --> 22:07.948
He is kind of outside.

22:07.968 --> 22:13.616
He may be perceived by some to be a rule, but he's a pretty sophisticated character.

22:13.656 --> 22:16.600
But generally speaking, I'm not just talking about this novel in general.

22:16.640 --> 22:23.689
You seem to have a particular kind of character that you write about.

22:24.327 --> 22:26.250
So you can just take it anywhere you want.

22:27.752 --> 22:33.119
I'm just looking for some quotes here.

22:33.139 --> 22:36.444
I think my characters, well, like the people, I guess.

22:37.425 --> 22:43.734
I mean, they're certainly not in the upper, you know, they're not in the patrician ranks, let's put it that way.

22:43.834 --> 22:49.322
No, no, and they're not...

22:50.045 --> 22:53.970
happily integrated into the society.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.873
They're not functioning cogs in the machine.

22:58.775 --> 23:03.581
They tend to be a little off one way or another.

23:03.701 --> 23:17.638
Mao said that the revolutionary is the fish who swims in the ocean of the people.

23:18.226 --> 23:28.684
They're some kind of weird fish that does that, too, without the revolutionary context or content.

23:30.367 --> 23:34.654
But, yeah, they've always, well, which is what I've always been in the mystery field, too.

23:34.674 --> 23:41.466
I've always been sort of the weirdo, the antibody within the mystery field.

23:41.733 --> 23:45.176
You've been most comfortable writing about New York, I gather.

23:45.477 --> 23:52.383
I can't say I've read the whole shelf, but is that... Yeah.

23:55.406 --> 24:02.953
To do other places, I've got to do some steeping of myself in it.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.596
New York, I kind of know.

24:06.757 --> 24:08.078
And I...

24:08.547 --> 24:15.797
It isn't knowing the streets, but it's knowing the attitudes and knowing the subtext, you know.

24:16.418 --> 24:32.659
But to do it elsewhere... So I had to talk to a lot of people in Branson and kind of get a feeling for it.

24:32.719 --> 24:36.985
And even so, there's a thing...

24:37.775 --> 24:42.480
I didn't realize at first, and then I realized that I was going to have to write the guy's songs.

24:44.222 --> 24:46.244
Some of those lyrics are funny, I have to say.

24:47.665 --> 24:50.829
Do you have tunes in mind when you're doing that, by the way?

24:55.293 --> 24:57.075
Tone deaf doesn't begin to describe me.

24:59.117 --> 25:03.782
There's a line, let me just interrupt for a second, in John Gregory Dunn's new novel.

25:04.387 --> 25:12.834
where one of the guys says, have you ever noticed that every Emily Dickinson poem can be sung to the tune of The Yellow Rose of Texas?

25:13.635 --> 25:19.580
And he gives an example, and son of a gun, if it isn't, it's... That's wonderful.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.841
It's a great line.

25:21.982 --> 25:23.123
That's great.

25:23.143 --> 25:25.965
And you try it, you know, and they give an example.

25:26.045 --> 25:27.066
It's hilarious.

25:27.146 --> 25:30.789
It's true, you know.

25:30.810 --> 25:33.752
Well, the thing is, I didn't know, but...

25:33.968 --> 25:50.733
Somebody at Warner's has a friend or an ex-husband or something who is a musician in Nashville who has done a singer-songwriter.

25:50.754 --> 26:00.989
And so he put two of them to music and got a bunch of the guys and they went into a recording studio on a weekend and did demos of two of the songs.

26:01.069 --> 26:01.630
And they're...

26:02.217 --> 26:03.078
They sound terrific.

26:03.358 --> 26:05.621
That's funny.

26:07.083 --> 26:07.864
Yeah.

26:08.865 --> 26:11.588
He made a couple changes in the lyrics as he went.

26:11.828 --> 26:17.415
And the changes he made usually for his own melody purposes.

26:17.495 --> 26:30.250
But there was one... There was one in...

26:31.057 --> 26:36.665
In particular, though, where he made a change and I realized I still hadn't got it quite right.

26:37.246 --> 26:45.037
Because I had written in one song that I can't find a sweetie no matter how I try.

26:46.199 --> 26:50.104
And he changed it to I can't find a woman no matter how I try.

26:51.266 --> 26:52.087
Oh, of course.

26:53.349 --> 26:55.131
There are no euphemisms in the country.

26:56.594 --> 26:57.655
That's a good line.

26:58.259 --> 27:01.123
When you went to Bretton, did you have an idea of what the plot was?

27:02.485 --> 27:05.950
Or was it still kind of prickle?

27:06.350 --> 27:11.117
Once I found the guy, I knew what the plot was.

27:12.459 --> 27:13.541
When I first went there, no.

27:14.001 --> 27:18.768
I was sort of swimming in the idea of it.

27:19.089 --> 27:27.220
By the time I went back the second time, I knew what it was so that

27:28.195 --> 27:45.681
The people I talked to and everything, I saw them in terms of him, you know, and how if he were Mickey Gilly, what would he say in that?

27:45.781 --> 27:47.284
How would he react and everything?

27:47.304 --> 27:53.112
And so, you know, not that he is Mickey Gilly or Willie Nelson or anyone else in particular.

27:53.132 --> 27:57.679
I wanted him to be some...

27:59.583 --> 28:03.428
some self-aware part of all of them.

28:04.510 --> 28:10.618
Now, as I understand, you're comfortable on both coasts, and I don't mean just geographically, of course.

28:11.580 --> 28:18.269
You've worked in... Well, I don't know that anybody's comfortable in Los Angeles.

28:18.289 --> 28:21.133
But, I mean, you've certainly worked with some success out there.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.977
Yeah, yeah.

28:24.137 --> 28:29.404
I mean, you can wear multiple hats, I guess, is what I'm driving at.

28:30.076 --> 28:36.425
I don't know how many people can switch that successfully from one medium to the next.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.106
What's the trick?

28:39.489 --> 28:46.919
I think that I've always thought visually anyway.

28:47.019 --> 28:52.486
I think the books tend to see the scenes as they go anyway.

28:52.987 --> 28:57.433
And I've also always kind of propelled the characters with dialogue.

28:57.987 --> 28:58.888
I'm sorry, with what?

28:59.569 --> 29:00.310
The character's what?

29:00.511 --> 29:01.272
With dialogue.

29:01.292 --> 29:01.853
Okay, I'm sorry.

29:02.133 --> 29:10.004
Yeah, and those are the two things, because really a screenplay is just, you know, a user's manual.

29:10.926 --> 29:20.299
You know, you take all these pieces and take the user's manual, and if you do everything that it says, at the end you'll have a bicycle.

29:20.988 --> 29:30.061
Clearly you don't have an overpowering ego either, because to make a screenplay, I mean, you realize that it's not going to be entirely your work either.

29:30.241 --> 29:31.263
Not at all.

29:31.804 --> 29:37.292
I'm wrong to say not at all, but not at all autonomous, no.

29:38.073 --> 29:42.379
You don't have the same sense of proprietorship, shall we say, that you would have with a novel.

29:42.619 --> 29:43.200
No, you can't.

29:43.441 --> 29:43.881
You can't.

29:44.742 --> 29:50.691
There's so many other people involved, there's so many other elements involved, and...

29:51.228 --> 29:55.232
I know years ago, somebody said wanting to be a screenwriter was like wanting to be co-pilot.

29:56.393 --> 30:10.765
And there is something of that there, but I have watched directors at work, and I know that A, I have the wrong temperament for it, and B, it's a terrible job.

30:12.847 --> 30:20.914
Maybe a fifth of their time is spent in the fun thing of sitting there next to the camera and saying, action cut, you know?

30:22.092 --> 30:39.153
before that starts, they have a whole long period of time of having to schmooze producers and actors and me and the set decorator and the costume designer.

30:39.694 --> 30:44.099
And then when the goddamn thing is finished, they have to spend another, I mean, finish shooting.

30:44.119 --> 30:51.829
They have to spend another three or four months or, in the grifter's case, well, Stephen was delaying it in Stephen Frears because...

30:52.450 --> 31:00.541
The company wanted to enter it into Cannes, and Stephen refused.

31:00.601 --> 31:04.526
He really didn't want it in Cannes.

31:04.546 --> 31:07.750
He said, I've managed to keep art out of it up to this point.

31:07.790 --> 31:10.154
I'm not going to let them put it in now.

31:10.174 --> 31:17.323
So he stalled the post-production until June, when it was too late.

31:19.005 --> 31:20.247
But still, he spent...
