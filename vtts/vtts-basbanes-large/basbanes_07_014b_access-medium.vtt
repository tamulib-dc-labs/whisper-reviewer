00:03.457 --> 00:07.522
You know, I took it up and put it back in as an A. That didn't mean it.

00:07.542 --> 00:24.240
But if one is interested in the history of that branch of the biblical scholarship, then the materials for that have to be every printing of every edition of these things, just as they would for a major author.

00:24.580 --> 00:27.203
The physical form is important, just as it is.

00:27.263 --> 00:30.527
I mean, I don't see how you can make a distinction between one category and another.

00:30.811 --> 00:39.841
Therefore, I am collecting those people just as I would really an author of more literary work.

00:41.042 --> 00:47.650
So that's one element in that that I think I would have that maybe a lot of other people wouldn't have.

00:48.631 --> 00:59.383
One subgroup there is the circle of Michael Sadler, John Carter, Percy Muir, that group of English bibliographers who

00:59.752 --> 01:04.940
were all connected with the book trade, either as publishers or book dealers.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.667
And, I think they were all fascinating as individuals.

01:10.769 --> 01:14.034
They were all, they really should be called scholars.

01:15.256 --> 01:21.405
They're very good examples of people who are in the commercial book trade, and at the same time,

01:21.824 --> 01:24.107
made an important contribution to scholarship.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.731
I think Sadler is one of the most significant.

01:26.771 --> 01:27.852
But John Carter, too.

01:28.213 --> 01:33.520
And not for the ABC, which is a wonderful book, but it gets all the attention.

01:33.580 --> 01:42.011
And the book called Taste and Technique in book collecting doesn't get as much attention, and yet I think it's really a great book.

01:42.031 --> 01:44.054
That's a beautiful book, really, I think.

01:44.074 --> 01:44.875
And it's, yes.

01:45.736 --> 01:51.544
So, I try to collect those people and those scholarly editors and bibliography

01:51.878 --> 01:57.064
as I would any other author, so I try to have all editions and printings.

01:57.224 --> 02:00.568
Do you try to get all of his possible press books, too?

02:00.748 --> 02:01.949
Well, I would.

02:01.969 --> 02:07.376
I haven't gotten so far with that, but I would be interested in doing it.

02:07.476 --> 02:08.717
I tried one of his novels.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.261
He's dated, certainly, as an author.

02:13.422 --> 02:14.764
He's a fascinating

02:15.537 --> 02:23.408
Well, I'm certainly not that far, I mean, far from being the only person collecting Sadler and John Carter.

02:23.428 --> 02:25.731
I think they're popular subjects to collect it.

02:25.751 --> 02:33.081
But I don't know that there would be many people collecting Fredson Bowers, W. W. Gray, Robbie Maccaro, and so on, in this way.

02:33.341 --> 02:35.825
Are they difficult books to find?

02:35.845 --> 02:38.909
Well, they're very difficult to find.

02:39.650 --> 02:40.992
And how do you do this through dealers?

02:41.132 --> 02:44.937
Yes, and browsing, which I do constantly, too.

02:45.102 --> 02:51.070
So, really, the only point I wanted to make was just... I think I saw you at the New York fairs.

02:51.190 --> 02:51.971
No, I wasn't there.

02:52.352 --> 02:53.253
Okay, it wasn't there.

02:53.273 --> 02:57.018
I thought I saw you when I was taking radio and getting remote.

02:57.098 --> 02:58.560
I was really kind of looking.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.663
No, I didn't get there.

03:00.783 --> 03:02.445
I don't really enjoy fairs.

03:02.505 --> 03:10.015
The only reason to go is to see some people you don't get to see often, and I didn't go.

03:10.035 --> 03:12.358
Okay, I thought I saw you from a distance.

03:14.127 --> 03:24.083
And I really, I believe, by the way, that I know you're on the German board, and I'm one of their earliest champions of print.

03:24.203 --> 03:27.649
In fact, they quoted me in a company.

03:27.669 --> 03:32.597
I just think, in fact, I'm writing a column next week on the vintage, which is .

03:32.677 --> 03:35.562
That's why .

03:36.166 --> 03:38.689
I think those vintage paperbacks are handsome.

03:38.709 --> 03:39.370
They're nice.

03:39.390 --> 03:42.813
And I like the idea that they're just doing one theme.

03:43.154 --> 03:46.117
Each one is out between two or three or four.

03:46.137 --> 03:48.480
Well, it happened to be one paperback, I think.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.501
Yeah, but it's good.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.121
It's nice.

03:50.602 --> 03:53.906
It serves an entirely different purpose and different market.

03:53.926 --> 03:55.007
And I even have the metal.

03:55.047 --> 03:56.308
Do you have the metal?

03:56.328 --> 03:58.751
I know what you mean, but... Oh, you have the one.

03:58.771 --> 03:59.872
I have the one.

03:59.892 --> 04:01.334
Well, that has to be scarce.

04:01.354 --> 04:02.315
It does.

04:03.356 --> 04:04.317
Well, they said...

04:04.651 --> 04:10.979
Dan Aaron told me that they gave subscribers the option of sending it in.

04:11.079 --> 04:14.424
Don't be dead.

04:14.444 --> 04:17.087
Everybody kept it.

04:17.107 --> 04:19.250
I measure that, but I don't know what its name is.

04:19.270 --> 04:20.552
No, I'm going to look for that.

04:20.732 --> 04:21.193
Oh, great.

04:21.754 --> 04:22.855
That'd be terrific.

04:24.157 --> 04:25.839
I hope we can do this again at some point.

04:26.039 --> 04:30.165
I know you're a busy man, and this is Robert Graves.

04:30.285 --> 04:31.907
I'll shut this off.

04:33.355 --> 04:36.278
Well, that's the point.

04:37.760 --> 04:44.587
You'd have to check how reliable his memory is, but from what I can tell, there's nothing wrong with his mind.

04:44.967 --> 04:50.573
Actually, he bought a couple of lots at the last Martin auction.

04:50.593 --> 04:55.238
And I said to him afterwards, I said, Dave, are these for a client or a piece of butter for stock?

04:55.258 --> 04:56.680
In fact, he sold me.

05:01.638 --> 05:17.783
The preceding interview was conducted with G. Thomas Tensel, T-A-N-S-I-E-L-L-E, on April 25, 1990, in his office at the Liebenheim Foundation.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.467
Mr. Zindler, I got your name here.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.649
What are you talking about?

05:21.669 --> 05:22.971
He was about to give me a quote.

05:22.991 --> 05:26.016
There are more books you were going to say.

05:26.236 --> 05:26.917
There are more women.

05:26.937 --> 05:29.061
Oh, I like that even better.

05:29.221 --> 05:30.042
We're here or in the

05:33.430 --> 05:37.898
You want the ultimate quote?

05:37.918 --> 05:43.046
There's no ultimate quote.

05:43.066 --> 05:43.467
Pussy is wonderful.

05:43.487 --> 05:47.193
What's the end of it?

05:47.213 --> 05:48.115
What do you expect?

05:48.702 --> 06:04.180
You have to break down women in categories of decades.

06:08.834 --> 06:19.596
And among my new interests, as I age, I have come to realize that Nabokov was not wrong.

06:19.616 --> 06:21.139
I used to turn the tape off, I'll tell you about what that was all about.

06:21.878 --> 06:36.863
If you want to talk about books, which I'm more than happy to hear.

06:36.883 --> 06:38.246
Well, I thought there's books that are interesting and good stories.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.728
I'm looking for a little bit of glare, a little bit of some eccentricity.

06:39.748 --> 06:40.570
I'm writing a book about book collectors.

06:40.590 --> 06:41.912
There is a broad purpose thesis about how the book collectors are.

06:55.021 --> 07:04.931
I have a few stories, probably.

07:04.951 --> 07:05.653
I would think I have a few stories.

07:05.673 --> 07:06.897
I have a number of stories, some of which may be interesting.

07:06.917 --> 07:07.258
Are you obsessed?

07:07.610 --> 07:24.411
I know a lot of people who would.

07:24.431 --> 07:32.301
I disagree.

07:38.002 --> 07:53.108
It's interesting and...

07:56.682 --> 08:12.295
well i'm pleased to say this is no big deal but i do have every book that child has to be illustrated well that's nice now where are the originals well you know what there's a show at yale right now on all of his island garden pictures now the original royals are there

08:26.078 --> 08:41.100
You cannot generalize or make absolute statements.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.221
But having said that, you can make absolute statements.

08:42.241 --> 08:42.642
All collectors deal.

08:42.662 --> 08:44.745
It doesn't mean that all collectors are dealers, or all dealers are collectors, but all collectors deal.

08:45.215 --> 09:13.168
If a collector does not deal, he is a monomaniac of some sort where he accumulates to himself whatever his universe is, but he's not... It's a different world of a collector, because collecting is an organic function, and it has to be a live function.

09:13.188 --> 09:14.209
You have to take in and get out, and essentially...

09:15.016 --> 09:21.112
discriminate.

09:21.132 --> 09:29.093
And the mechanism of discrimination, which is individual, I mean, a lot of people I know that my particular mechanism is to, if I become interested in something,

09:30.035 --> 09:49.291
tend to bottom fish.

09:49.311 --> 09:52.394
I want everything of that something without any concern about condition.

09:52.414 --> 09:52.754
I just want mass.

09:52.774 --> 09:56.498
I want to be able to handle, because by handling products, you learn relative value, relative condition, and discrimination.

09:56.518 --> 09:58.539
If you're going to go... Yeah, but I mean, by the same token, you're still looking for the best data.

09:58.559 --> 09:58.900
I agree for that.

09:58.920 --> 09:59.400
If you're the type of

10:05.152 --> 10:07.278
You want only fine things.

10:07.298 --> 10:08.541
The best things.

10:08.642 --> 10:13.114
The best profits.

10:13.134 --> 10:16.082
My feeling is that you are cheated.

10:16.102 --> 10:16.343
It's like...

10:16.846 --> 10:27.738
I have a few heroes in my life.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.100
One of them is a guy named A.J.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.382
Liebling.

10:31.402 --> 10:33.304
And you should read him.

10:33.324 --> 10:33.684
I read everything.

10:33.704 --> 10:36.307
I proselytized Liebling.

10:36.327 --> 10:37.528
I told you I'm a literary critic.

10:37.548 --> 10:38.049
That's my business.

10:38.069 --> 10:38.169
Okay.

10:38.189 --> 10:39.310
Anyway, Liebling talks about eating good food.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.133
And he says, you know, the guys that go to the finest restaurants don't know what goat's heads are, sheep's heads, or pig's knuckles.

10:42.153 --> 10:42.634
There's no balance of...

10:42.614 --> 10:49.804
of, let's say, the earthly delights.

10:49.825 --> 10:54.031
You only have the finest things, which is fine for them, but to many people, these people are missing a vital function.

10:54.051 --> 10:57.496
Can I give you an example of what you're saying?

10:57.596 --> 10:59.779
I am the greatest respect for Dick Manning.

10:59.759 --> 11:04.626
But he paid $200,000 for post-Tamilay.

11:06.048 --> 11:09.974
My hero was the guy that bought it for $15 in the bin of trash.

11:10.535 --> 11:12.738
Because he could have been me.

11:12.758 --> 11:14.581
Because I go to these fucking places.

11:14.661 --> 11:15.202
I really do.

11:15.222 --> 11:16.904
I get down on my hands and knees.

11:16.924 --> 11:17.345
I get dirty.

11:17.645 --> 11:23.053
And sometimes I find something that's almost as good as a piece of that.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.335
It is a charge.

11:24.436 --> 11:26.138
Am I right or am I wrong?

11:26.118 --> 11:40.285
It's almost as good as it be.

11:40.305 --> 11:41.207
Sometimes, maybe even it is as good as it is.

11:41.227 --> 11:43.832
I don't want to stretch the metaphor, but... Whatever it is, in a modest statement, there was a guy by the name of George Brimley.

11:43.852 --> 11:44.293
I've got his catalogs.

11:44.313 --> 11:44.413
Okay.

11:44.765 --> 11:58.707
I don't think there has been any person who has acquired

12:03.395 --> 12:20.396
a collection of American imprints.

12:20.416 --> 12:23.300
Not that it approaches Brindley, but I mean, my collection of American imprints is the only major collection that has ever been done since then.

12:23.320 --> 12:23.500
Brindley.

12:23.520 --> 12:23.580
OK.

12:23.560 --> 12:44.888
You say that categorically.

12:44.908 --> 12:45.228
I'm telling you.

12:45.248 --> 12:46.690
There's not some private guy out there that's also doing the same stuff.

12:46.710 --> 12:46.911
That's it.

12:46.931 --> 12:49.033
I have been, and it's not been a, it's not been a, well, I mean, I think I've been doing it for 10 years.

12:49.053 --> 12:49.534
And what I found is that

12:52.754 --> 13:11.179
There are very few people who are students of this universe, this little piss-ass universe.

13:11.199 --> 13:11.940
Which universe are you talking about?

13:11.960 --> 13:12.180
Rare books.

13:12.200 --> 13:12.621
Certainly in America.

13:12.641 --> 13:13.362
When I come to listen to this thing.

13:14.168 --> 13:34.233
I have to know precisely what you're talking about.

13:34.253 --> 13:36.656
The universe of rare books, the American universe of whatever you want to define as being rare books or book collecting.

13:36.676 --> 13:39.299
Now, there are many collectors, there are many dealers there, whatever you want them to be, but students of the trade are very few.

13:39.319 --> 13:39.859
I'm a student of the trade.

13:39.880 --> 13:40.080
All right.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.121
Name somebody important and go get a book for them.

13:42.029 --> 13:52.606
I don't know Aaron Lansky.

13:52.967 --> 13:59.497
Aaron Lansky's got a chapter in my book.

14:00.159 --> 14:02.282
Aaron Lansky, I don't have to record.

14:02.752 --> 14:05.920
Say that again.

14:05.940 --> 14:06.782
No, I know no one.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.466
I've got a major collection of books of first-rate collection of books.

14:08.486 --> 14:09.148
That's what you're saying.

14:09.168 --> 14:11.073
And anyway, I know no one.

14:11.093 --> 14:12.316
And you said that.

14:12.336 --> 14:12.677
I know no one.

14:12.697 --> 14:14.261
What do you mean, I know no one?

14:14.281 --> 14:14.702
I know no collectors.

14:16.184 --> 14:39.133
This is the wonderful thing about it.

14:39.153 --> 14:39.694
I know no collectors, okay?

14:39.714 --> 14:40.234
I know no one in my field.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.075
I've been walking along, even collectors.

14:41.095 --> 14:43.418
I mean, I really, I shouldn't say I know no one, but as a general statement, I know all of the dealers in the world.

14:43.438 --> 14:44.740
There isn't a dealer in the world of Americana that I don't know.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.195
Why do you say Galbraith is the best deal ever?

14:52.482 --> 15:11.703
I mean, is it because maybe he has things that appeal to you personally?

15:11.723 --> 15:12.664
Are you making this as an objective evaluation?

15:12.684 --> 15:12.844
Exactly.

15:12.864 --> 15:13.805
He has one of the finest minds I've ever heard.

15:13.825 --> 15:14.506
He's a good writer, too, actually.

15:14.526 --> 15:15.307
He can't spell, but he's a good writer.

15:15.327 --> 15:15.988
He has an encyclopedic knowledge.

15:16.008 --> 15:16.448
He is a true academic.

15:18.470 --> 15:37.876
He's been collecting books since he was about 9 or 10.

15:37.896 --> 15:38.677
And he's got the money to back them up.

15:38.697 --> 15:39.378
He's got everything going through.

15:39.398 --> 15:39.978
He's a nice guy on top of it.

15:39.998 --> 15:40.579
He's a nice guy on top of it.

15:40.599 --> 15:41.681
But I mean, uh... Yeah, he prints a beautiful catalog.

15:41.701 --> 15:41.861
I think.

15:41.881 --> 15:42.662
I had something to do with changing it.

15:42.682 --> 15:43.183
There's much to compress.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.104
I've only been getting it from the last year.

15:44.124 --> 15:44.224
Um...

15:46.550 --> 16:02.459
How did you develop it?

16:02.479 --> 16:02.879
I'll make the event.

16:02.899 --> 16:03.661
You'll come down one day to Art State.

16:03.681 --> 16:03.881
Thank you.

16:03.901 --> 16:04.322
I'll get some good...

16:05.720 --> 16:27.403
I'll get some good ricotta.

16:27.423 --> 16:27.964
I'll get some good cheeses.

16:27.984 --> 16:28.444
I'll open up some wine.

16:28.464 --> 16:29.005
You can have some red wine.

16:29.025 --> 16:29.606
You can have some right wine.

16:29.626 --> 16:30.326
I have a library next to my office.

16:30.346 --> 16:30.647
I'll sit there.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.268
I'll get Manny up from New York, who has better things to do, but he'll do this.

16:34.651 --> 16:34.751
Okay?
