WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:04.799
Has that changed for you?

00:04.819 --> 00:08.703
I don't know, because it's been so many years since I've read it.

00:09.764 --> 00:13.689
But that's one of your Desert Island books that you take on the Desert Island?

00:13.729 --> 00:14.170
Yeah.

00:14.190 --> 00:17.213
And what was the second one you mentioned?

00:17.233 --> 00:22.980
Well, I thought this morning that a good choice would be like a book that would teach me how to survive on islands.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.462
That would be kind of important.

00:24.762 --> 00:26.204
And what was the one you said last night?

00:26.604 --> 00:29.748
It was Weldon by Thoreau.

00:29.968 --> 00:30.709
And why was that?

00:30.729 --> 00:31.590
Because you hadn't read it yet.

00:32.093 --> 00:42.670
There were parts of it, and it was well written, and it seemed like something you could read over and over again and find new layers of meaning and all that.

00:42.690 --> 00:49.241
And it's another book about a guy in isolation, making myself sound like a very isolated guy, I guess.

00:50.403 --> 00:52.566
And then the third one was the...

00:54.166 --> 00:55.388
A book full of blank pages.

00:56.269 --> 01:02.396
I've got a book representing my past, a book from my present, and blank pages representing my future.

01:03.458 --> 01:06.021
That's a good answer.

01:06.041 --> 01:06.462
That's good.

01:06.482 --> 01:08.084
Well, I've heard it last night.

01:09.506 --> 01:10.707
It's interesting.

01:10.927 --> 01:11.848
God damn it.

01:12.309 --> 01:12.770
It's so good.

01:12.850 --> 01:14.612
And I like it.

01:14.632 --> 01:17.536
So I wanted to get it in.

01:17.556 --> 01:18.837
What kind of writing do you hope to do?

01:20.900 --> 01:21.361
Fiction.

01:22.102 --> 01:22.502
Fiction.

01:22.718 --> 01:25.220
I can't say any more specifically than that, you know.

01:25.861 --> 01:26.742
I don't have a genre.

01:26.762 --> 01:29.584
To me, good writing is good writing, and I hope to do good writing.

01:30.585 --> 01:39.473
And whether it's, you know, drama or thriller or science fiction or whatever, it's irrelevant.

01:40.774 --> 01:41.154
I agree.

01:41.855 --> 01:42.816
Good writing is good writing.

01:43.636 --> 01:44.357
That's really it.

01:44.377 --> 01:51.223
I didn't want to take up too much of your time, but I did want to try to get that.

01:51.777 --> 02:02.248
As long as we're talking, I guess about two months ago, I was talking to Lesley's case, and I told him that I played chess with you a couple times, and I think the last time we played, you won.

02:04.210 --> 02:12.599
But you and I had a talk one day when we were driving out, I think, to the north entry control point, and we talked a little bit about the fact that you wanted to be a writer.

02:13.160 --> 02:16.924
And when I was, how old were you, 21?

02:16.984 --> 02:17.124
20.

02:17.484 --> 02:20.788
When I was 20, I was trying very hard to be a writer.

02:21.022 --> 02:22.684
And I think I had a pretty good start.

02:23.986 --> 02:25.768
I wrote about 40 short stories.

02:25.868 --> 02:29.132
I wrote on the order of about 1,500 poems.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.433
Some of them have been published.

02:32.015 --> 02:33.777
I wrote three novels.

02:34.238 --> 02:39.184
Two were what I would call amateur, a category called The Boom to Among You.

02:39.404 --> 02:45.451
Learning how to write, learning how to find your voice, learning how to build a set.

02:45.652 --> 02:48.095
And the third book I wrote I think was a good book.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.316
I was proud of it.

02:49.877 --> 02:50.978
And I...

02:51.835 --> 02:54.518
Foolishly did not ever make a copy of it.

02:54.578 --> 02:58.182
I never put it on a computer.

02:58.483 --> 02:59.884
It was really before computers.

03:00.024 --> 03:04.069
I lost it just before really computers was common.

03:04.089 --> 03:06.372
And the manuscript came up missing and I've lost it.

03:06.392 --> 03:06.812
It's gone.

03:07.393 --> 03:09.515
I mean, I've got pieces of it, but I've lost it.

03:09.535 --> 03:17.605
But I'm telling all that because at your age, and from well before your age, my goal was to be a writer.

03:17.745 --> 03:18.906
I knew that I wanted to write it.

03:19.510 --> 03:21.393
That's not what I ended up doing, needless to say.

03:21.573 --> 03:24.117
Not writing what I thought I was going to write, which was novels.

03:25.159 --> 03:42.565
But thinking back on that, and I've taught English, and despite being a soldier and an officer in the army, in some way or another I've always tried to maintain my connection with literature, with language, with writing, with book culture.

03:43.270 --> 03:47.916
I thought about the fact when I heard that you wanted to be a writer, and I think you've got all the skill and necessary.

03:47.976 --> 03:49.537
You've got the natural abilities.

03:49.557 --> 03:51.920
It's really what you want to do with it and where you want to take it.

03:52.581 --> 04:11.083
But I thought if there was any advice I could have given myself back then that I would have profited from, that I wish somebody probably did say to me back then, and I tried to say this to you in a way that maybe would be useful to you, and I said, what's the most important things you can do to become a good wife?

04:12.008 --> 04:16.013
And I think there's two things that you can do, two very critical things.

04:16.033 --> 04:19.217
One is, you have to write.

04:19.318 --> 04:20.239
Right is right.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.020
Writer's right.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.685
I mean, there's a theory of writing that says, I'm an inspired writer.

04:24.745 --> 04:29.331
Richard Bach wrote a book, it was very popular in the late 60s, called John Helens and Siegel.

04:29.811 --> 04:36.320
And there's this notion of inspired writing, and the muse is going to come, and it's going to stretch.

04:36.941 --> 04:39.484
But there's a history of the belief of that

04:40.595 --> 04:42.658
approach to art that it's inspired.

04:43.419 --> 04:50.710
The other theory, I think, of art, and I want to be very generalistic, is that great work is achieved through great work.

04:51.952 --> 05:00.364
In other words, great literature is written through great effort and work and research and rewriting and all the things that are the brudgery of the business.

05:01.365 --> 05:06.653
And I think now at this age, I believe that that's

05:07.156 --> 05:11.381
Tom Stauer Edison said it's true, 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration.

05:11.401 --> 05:15.246
It may have been Faulkner, it may have been, I don't know who it was, but writing is very easy.

05:15.266 --> 05:17.770
All you do is open the pane and, you know, bring another page.

05:19.172 --> 05:28.003
So writing was one of those two things I think you can do to get better.

05:28.023 --> 05:31.948
But the other thing you can do is you can read voraciously.

05:32.536 --> 05:38.104
And if there's something I know now that I didn't know then, and I've always been a pretty picky reader.

05:38.184 --> 05:40.427
I mean, I don't read a lot of recreational reading.

05:40.528 --> 05:43.692
I don't read, and some people say I'm a snob.

05:43.772 --> 05:46.476
I don't read a lot of paperback trash.

05:46.496 --> 05:47.357
I mean, I just don't.

05:47.418 --> 05:48.079
And many people do.

05:48.099 --> 05:49.260
They read it for entertainment.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.482
I read trash.

05:50.502 --> 05:54.788
I spent 14 hours a day reading my work.

05:55.469 --> 05:59.455
I don't read anything that I think is trash, because every book I pick, I think it's trash.

05:59.654 --> 06:03.658
What can this book give me?

06:03.758 --> 06:04.459
It's popcorn.

06:04.499 --> 06:05.760
It's popcorn in the brain.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.561
That's right.

06:06.581 --> 06:10.184
But what I know now is when I look, I mean, I'm only 44.

06:10.224 --> 06:12.126
I'm 44, which is not exactly old.

06:12.246 --> 06:16.430
But believe it or not, I have a keen sense in my mind.

06:16.470 --> 06:23.597
It's like I have an hourglass with the sand running through, and I can see that every day I have a little less time to read all the things I want to read.

06:23.617 --> 06:29.222
And in my mind, I've never sat down and made a 10,000 reading list, but I know that there's probably...

06:29.489 --> 06:32.473
Probably something like 10,000 more books that I want to read in my lifetime.

06:33.034 --> 06:39.844
And I know, right now I know, that even if I live to be 90, I'm not going to get to read every book that I intend to read.

06:40.765 --> 06:42.107
For a whole bunch of reasons.

06:42.187 --> 06:43.809
Number one, life gets in the way.

06:43.829 --> 06:49.257
Number two, I get sidetracked because I end up reading other things I didn't plan to read but that I end up wanting to read.

06:49.277 --> 06:51.540
So there's serendipitous reading.

06:51.560 --> 06:56.948
But the point in all this is, what I was trying to tell you that day, and I hope you thought about it later, is

06:57.788 --> 07:15.776
You don't have to be completely anal retentive about a reading program, but I do think it helps to have a basic program, at least an idea of certain pieces of that that kind of need to be, for other writers to look at you and go, you haven't read Moby Dick?

07:15.836 --> 07:17.939
How can I take you seriously if you haven't read Moby Dick?

07:18.259 --> 07:20.022
Or you haven't read this or you haven't read that.

07:22.285 --> 07:23.948
I'm hesitant to say that you should adopt it.

07:24.164 --> 07:27.807
the great classics program like they did at Stanford, you know, that whole debate.

07:27.967 --> 07:28.147
St.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.790
John's College, Columbia did it for a while.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.212
And yet, there's an awful lot of virtue in that.

07:33.232 --> 07:35.814
I mean, I think you have to read some of the other stuff, too.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.556
You have to have a well-rounded, diverse reading.

07:38.016 --> 07:46.143
But at the end of the day, the key there is, I don't know anybody that's a great writer that I consider a really, really top writer that doesn't read like crazy.

07:46.163 --> 07:46.664
I just don't.

07:46.804 --> 07:49.806
I don't know anybody that's not well-read that writes well.

07:51.468 --> 07:52.188
That's my comment.

07:52.208 --> 07:52.809
That's pretty good.

07:53.550 --> 07:54.070
Well, I'm

07:54.488 --> 07:56.812
Are we going to go back to the office?

07:56.832 --> 07:57.213
We can.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.477
I was thinking we're going to go to customs.

07:59.737 --> 08:02.061
We're going to drop him off because he's got to go back to the office.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.123
I don't know if you want to borrow that.

08:03.163 --> 08:06.409
I thought that was right along the lines of what you were talking about.

08:06.429 --> 08:12.640
I read a book, Nick, and I can't remember the name of it.

08:12.740 --> 08:15.184
That's fewer than there are brigadier generals.

08:15.304 --> 08:19.652
There's like 350 brigadier generals.

08:19.885 --> 08:22.069
Don't be upset by asking this question.

08:22.089 --> 08:24.533
How old are you, might I ask?

08:24.653 --> 08:25.374
Fifty-eight.

08:25.394 --> 08:25.715
Fifty-eight.

08:25.795 --> 08:25.996
Fantastic.

08:26.016 --> 08:27.879
That's not what you told me last night, Chief.

08:27.899 --> 08:28.099
I know.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.664
I told her twenty-nine.

08:30.924 --> 08:31.385
Did it work?

08:32.607 --> 08:36.754
Well, I got his room number.

08:36.894 --> 08:40.240
I'm the only one who knew where he was.

08:41.097 --> 08:42.259
She's such a person.

08:42.459 --> 08:50.771
What he was starting to tell you was his family started the Kansas City Irish Parade.

08:51.813 --> 08:52.394
No kidding.

08:53.415 --> 08:55.158
So that's where you're from, Kansas City?

08:55.178 --> 08:57.181
Yes, sir.

08:57.301 --> 09:01.407
And so you've been in the service for what year?

09:01.427 --> 09:02.669
I started in 1967.

09:02.769 --> 09:04.872
I was in there.

09:04.972 --> 09:06.835
No, I come in later.

09:07.675 --> 09:10.419
I'll have to start calling you junior.

09:12.782 --> 09:15.045
October of 1967, I went to Navy OCS, Newport.

09:15.105 --> 09:19.872
So you and I went in the same time?

09:20.252 --> 09:22.816
Well, just about.

09:22.836 --> 09:26.501
You raised better than I had.

09:26.521 --> 09:28.363
Let me keep having more fun.

09:33.771 --> 09:35.353
So, and how long have you been flying?

09:35.738 --> 09:37.987
I've been flying since 1964.

09:39.594 --> 09:42.244
I started flying when I was in high school.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.610
Flying what?

09:43.650 --> 09:44.955
Well, I started with a...

09:45.526 --> 09:54.902
what was called a PA-22-108, it's a Piper Colt, and blew everything on a little airfield out there, helping no grads and that.

09:54.962 --> 10:01.873
Wash and wax airplanes for trading time for flight instruction.

10:01.893 --> 10:05.880
So about anything they had out there I thought.

10:07.278 --> 10:37.217
what i thought was kind of well look back funny now but i was real embarrassed because i didn't get a chance to get my dad to get my driver's license but i was ready to get my police license oh no thank you man that's got some heat cut and uh you like hot food oh yeah yeah my eyebrows are melting so i had to i made my mom drive me to the end of the parking lot because i didn't have my driver's license so she had to take me to get my uh

10:37.197 --> 10:45.286
I didn't want the guys at the airport to know you didn't know how to drive.

10:46.607 --> 10:49.711
I knew how to drive it because he didn't have a license.

10:49.971 --> 10:51.733
It's that manly stuff.

10:51.753 --> 10:54.736
And what did you fly in Vietnam?

10:54.816 --> 10:58.200
I flew Charlie model gunships and rovers.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.943
Wow.

11:01.109 --> 11:12.929
That was more of an accident than anything.

11:13.330 --> 11:20.202
It was supposed to be a safe mission.

11:20.242 --> 11:22.746
It was a firefly mission where they just have a

11:23.080 --> 11:28.633
single Huey go up at 4,000 or 5,000 feet and drop players in a single gunship.

11:28.653 --> 11:30.256
And we just kind of ran along the border.

11:30.818 --> 11:38.435
I thought it was, they called it, and you knew that, the Vietnamese, or NBA transportation.

11:38.455 --> 11:40.279
It looked like a line of water going below that.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.563
coming across the border.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.445
It was just twilight.

11:44.545 --> 11:49.711
I just rolled in and turned the systems hot and it turned out to be a regiment of NBA armor.

11:49.931 --> 11:50.171
Wow.

11:50.892 --> 11:54.877
It was kind of hard.

11:54.897 --> 11:57.520
I had overlapping fire in all progress.

11:57.660 --> 12:00.563
It was kind of hard to break contact.

12:00.583 --> 12:06.330
I just kept shooting at them until there wasn't anything left.

12:06.490 --> 12:06.570
Wow.

12:06.871 --> 12:23.251
Well, I guess they got a 142-pills, a 107 Coraless, and a Quad 50 machine gun I picked out, and an ATC of some sort, whatever that was.

12:23.271 --> 12:29.098
It was probably a Lambretta scooter with some garbage cans on the side of it.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.564
I think it was in March.

12:34.584 --> 12:36.329
I can't remember.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.655
Something like that.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.406
That would be great when you could get the two of us.

12:44.812 --> 12:44.913
Dude.

12:45.013 --> 12:45.113
Dude.

12:45.346 --> 13:10.408
to uh thank god for photoshop yeah yeah well no i was gonna i was gonna cut from the head up get rid of that and get rid of the jowl yeah so you probably won't

13:10.388 --> 13:12.171
Pick a number.

13:12.231 --> 13:14.995
How many, how many different boys?

13:15.015 --> 13:19.783
Really, oh really just this, the first, Vietnam.

13:19.943 --> 13:24.911
I've flown in a lot of different countries.

13:25.853 --> 13:32.583
I hold a dubious record of being shot down the most in my unit and still coming back alive.

13:32.704 --> 13:34.847
Six times in one year.

13:34.947 --> 13:35.368
And when?

13:35.468 --> 13:35.989
How long?

13:36.009 --> 13:36.750
In how long?

13:36.730 --> 13:38.239
Where is that then?

13:38.963 --> 13:42.301
In Vietnam, in Vietnam.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.192
It wasn't very much.

13:45.117 --> 13:53.107
You take a round and you see something going out and you just kind of go over the other tree and land and get out and get the other helicopter.

13:53.127 --> 13:54.469
That's not very spectacular.

13:54.489 --> 13:56.031
I mean, it really is.

13:56.171 --> 13:59.675
Well, it is spectacular to be able to walk up and get any other one.

13:59.735 --> 14:01.838
Well, I had a deal.

14:01.898 --> 14:07.224
You know, you don't have much between you and the plexiglass and what you're doing.

14:07.685 --> 14:09.027
I had a theory on this.

14:09.047 --> 14:13.352
It's just like the rocket that hit our trailers a couple of days ago.

14:13.957 --> 14:18.192
Some of the guys wanted to move out, and I said, that's the safest place right there to live.

14:18.934 --> 14:21.524
I would put my bed right in the middle of that hole because what's the odds?

14:22.106 --> 14:24.253
So anybody that got shot or killed,

14:24.706 --> 14:32.177
I would borrow their equipment, because if somebody got shot in that chicken plate, well, what's the odds of me getting shot in the same chicken plate that so-and-so did?

14:32.197 --> 14:36.123
So pretty soon, towards the end of my tour, I was invincible because I had nothing.

14:36.143 --> 14:39.227
But, I mean, what's the odds of getting shot with all this crud on?

14:39.247 --> 14:44.715
Because it is my psychological armor against... So were you superstitious?

14:45.677 --> 14:46.478
I'm Irish.

14:46.947 --> 14:51.492
We have banshees and all that other good stuff.

14:51.712 --> 14:54.415
I'm talking about make-believe stuff.

14:54.795 --> 14:58.098
Roman Catholic.

14:58.118 --> 15:01.041
You can't do that.

15:01.061 --> 15:04.685
I'm your TAO question.

15:04.785 --> 15:07.168
He also believes the confession of goodwill.

15:07.548 --> 15:08.469
Oh, there you go.

15:08.489 --> 15:11.813
See, if you can't behave yourself, we're going to put you in an interview.

15:12.013 --> 15:12.814
I know.

15:12.934 --> 15:15.216
I know.

15:15.685 --> 15:17.047
I try to be good.

15:17.368 --> 15:20.994
Have you made any comparisons between your experience in Vietnam and Vietnam?

15:21.014 --> 15:23.277
I did, and I have, and it is similar.

15:23.358 --> 15:32.192
In one instance, well, I can only speak in my little snap, my little itty-bitty window, you know, from flying across.

15:32.212 --> 15:35.838
But I'm flying basically the same tactics I used in Vietnam.

15:35.878 --> 15:42.469
We're flying this Sherpa 100 feet off the ground as fast as we go because the people aren't duck hunters.

15:42.618 --> 15:46.261
so they don't have a leading aircraft very well.

15:46.361 --> 15:47.322
That's the principle.

15:47.342 --> 15:48.483
Yeah, I mean, it works.

15:48.503 --> 15:59.933
I mean, it was tough on my crew chiefs that sat behind me, because I used to wear a big white helmet with no doors, and they'd try to get me, and usually they got the tailbone, but occasionally they moved up a little closer.

16:00.314 --> 16:01.695
That's reasonable.

16:01.715 --> 16:04.758
I'm just like, sure.

16:04.778 --> 16:05.078
Thanks.

16:05.358 --> 16:10.583
But from flying across the country here, just like I did in Vietnam,

16:10.867 --> 16:13.631
The landscape, instead of a wet one, is a dry one.

16:14.252 --> 16:19.459
But you still see people living in incredibly primitive conditions with their families.

16:20.039 --> 16:23.604
And you can see them toiling out there from sun up to sunset.

16:23.624 --> 16:29.132
Hey, Chief, can you show you this patch here?

16:29.152 --> 16:30.473
That's the Mayor Cowell, right here.

16:31.515 --> 16:33.457
That's the 23rd Division.

16:33.477 --> 16:37.583
There's not very many guys wearing that, but there are at least...

16:37.850 --> 16:39.525
two here on LCA.

16:39.747 --> 16:42.713
The reason we're doing this, I'm a PAO.

16:43.182 --> 16:48.287
Well, I'm ready.

16:48.728 --> 16:56.936
No, no, he's good, he's good.

16:57.177 --> 17:02.562
Chief here, he's talking about the experience of Vietnam.

17:02.582 --> 17:07.307
Chief was a pilot and got involved in Michigan and Cambodia border in 1970.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.869
That's incredible what we're talking about.

17:08.849 --> 17:11.533
You weren't Chinook, were you?

17:11.553 --> 17:13.837
No, it was Charlie Model Gunships and Covers.

17:13.857 --> 17:15.720
Yeah, I used to pick them up all the time.

17:15.980 --> 17:18.044
Yeah, they used to drop my aircraft all the time.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.608
There's about 15 where this pad can see it right.

17:20.828 --> 17:23.953
Yeah, and I tell you what, the scariest I've ever been is flying in a Chinook.

17:23.973 --> 17:25.756
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:25.856 --> 17:28.721
Let me get a picture of you.

17:29.222 --> 17:33.068
I forgot my camera back at my quarters, and I...

17:33.723 --> 17:37.827
I'm looking at your ankles now.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.490
Yeah, I love it.

17:40.951 --> 17:45.635
You're such a pisser.

17:46.356 --> 17:50.220
I know, but you're still a pisser.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.163
It's okay.

17:53.183 --> 17:57.428
You can say that.

17:58.269 --> 17:59.730
Bam Smith is a pisser.

18:00.537 --> 18:22.900
This patch, 23rd, stood down December 17, 1971.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.781
Okay.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.883
So tell me your first name?

18:26.144 --> 18:26.384
Donald.

18:26.404 --> 18:29.627
For a piece of paper.

18:29.647 --> 18:29.747
Yeah.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.569
Would you please get his phone number?

18:31.589 --> 18:31.649
No.

18:31.669 --> 18:32.430
I'll give you a holler.

18:32.510 --> 18:33.652
Okay, Donald.

18:33.772 --> 18:34.633
You get the phone.

18:34.653 --> 18:35.574
Yeah, get his phone number.

18:35.594 --> 18:36.254
It's perfect.

18:36.395 --> 18:38.917
That's the third American health page I have seen.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.359
We call it MetroCal.

18:41.120 --> 18:41.620
What?

18:41.700 --> 18:42.861
MetroCal.

18:42.982 --> 18:43.702
Are you sexual?

18:43.722 --> 18:44.764
No, you don't know.

18:44.784 --> 18:45.885
That is recorded.

18:45.985 --> 18:46.706
Oh, I'm sorry?

18:46.966 --> 18:48.027
Six, seven.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.991
You guys are so young you don't even know.

18:53.975 --> 19:08.496
He doesn't look old enough.

19:08.476 --> 19:12.785
Okay, but why do they call it, what do you just call it?

19:12.805 --> 19:14.007
I don't know why they call it the Metricow.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.370
I know why they call it the Americow.

19:15.390 --> 19:17.053
The Illinois flag?

19:17.073 --> 19:17.654
Ah!

19:17.875 --> 19:19.017
Out of World War II.

19:19.037 --> 19:19.859
Let's see if he knows.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.546
Hey, sir, have you ever heard it called the Metricow patch?

19:23.807 --> 19:24.268
Yes.

19:24.288 --> 19:24.969
Americow.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.514
No, we call it Metricow.

19:27.494 --> 19:31.760
They're so young, they don't even know what MetroCal was, the first diet drink way back when.

19:31.780 --> 19:36.807
And that was me trying to make it.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.809
It was the original Nutrisis.

19:38.829 --> 19:42.234
It was canned diet stuff back in the 70s.

19:42.254 --> 19:45.799
I was with the... It was a flying boss car.

19:45.819 --> 19:49.504
They had two diets on their ass, a nylon, and had six ones on them.

19:49.684 --> 19:51.847
What year were you there?

19:51.867 --> 19:52.007
71, 72.

19:52.027 --> 19:52.708
Pretty late.

19:52.958 --> 19:59.650
Yeah, that's why I'm so young.

19:59.750 --> 20:09.187
I know a little bit about the Weir Cow.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.693
That's one unit I did a lot of research on.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.376
But no, I'm 54.

20:14.677 --> 20:16.822
He's 54, their folks 58.

20:17.804 --> 20:19.628
But that's not what the chief told me last night.

20:19.648 --> 20:20.550
He was over there earlier.

20:20.570 --> 20:22.394
Yeah, he was over there earlier.

20:22.414 --> 20:24.979
He told me he was like 37, 38.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.086
My hair's out of work now.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.812
He's got that much time in service.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.094
Hey, thanks.

20:32.115 --> 20:34.459
I know I caught you off the car.

20:34.479 --> 20:35.822
Thank you so much.

20:35.842 --> 20:36.463
I appreciate it.

20:36.523 --> 20:37.405
That's okay.

20:37.505 --> 20:38.126
I'm used to it.

20:38.146 --> 20:41.272
I worked at a theater lover the whole time.

20:41.513 --> 20:47.704
I spent most of my time with the theater support and management down in New Orleans.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.025
Yeah.

20:48.207 --> 20:50.090
Getting ready to come back over.

20:50.110 --> 20:52.094
Were you down there during the hurricane?

20:52.114 --> 20:55.260
No, I was there during the hurricane.

20:55.280 --> 20:55.761
You were here?

20:55.881 --> 20:56.342
Were you?

20:56.362 --> 20:58.386
I've been here for 15 months straight.

20:58.446 --> 20:59.087
This would have been?

20:59.107 --> 20:59.428
Really?

20:59.628 --> 21:02.613
This would have been a better place to be.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.056
I mean, I haven't been to New Orleans.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.132
Everything I've seen.

21:07.233 --> 21:12.998
I need a good story because I'm running for miles right now.

21:13.819 --> 21:18.223
Just read that number of letters and make sure you got it right.

21:18.323 --> 21:19.824
312-987-6967-46404.

21:19.844 --> 21:22.687
Well, no, what it is, we have a beatback.

21:22.787 --> 21:25.069
Okay, so I dialed the PSN.

21:25.229 --> 21:26.890
It sends me here.

21:26.910 --> 21:30.454
Put in the 1 and put in the 4 vision.

21:30.554 --> 21:31.795
Put in the 1 first?

21:31.815 --> 21:31.915
Yeah.

21:31.935 --> 21:32.035
Okay.

21:32.403 --> 21:35.828
But you're right over here at AMSB.

21:35.848 --> 21:37.671
Yeah, I'm right over here.

21:37.691 --> 21:37.812
Okay.

21:37.832 --> 21:38.052
Got it.

21:38.373 --> 21:39.034
AMSB.

21:39.054 --> 21:39.614
All right, that's it.

21:39.635 --> 21:39.875
Okay.

21:39.895 --> 21:44.622
I need a good story, because when I get back, I'm going to run against Dick Durbin.

21:44.642 --> 21:48.028
Go get him.

21:48.168 --> 21:49.230
It'll be fun.

21:50.011 --> 21:55.360
After I use this file, I'll use more records or something.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.243
Thank you, sir.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.646
Okay.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.047
Sorry.

22:00.466 --> 22:14.155
You were talking about the similarities I see when I fly across the country.

22:14.590 --> 22:18.798
I'm flying at 100 feet just like I did back 37 years ago.

22:19.600 --> 22:31.843
And I still see the family out there working in the field and just struggling to take care of me or anybody.

22:31.923 --> 22:35.931
And I've got a picture of it.

22:36.011 --> 22:37.594
It's the same thing.

22:38.047 --> 22:48.780
They all look friendly and wave just like the Vietnamese did, and they're concerned with what's right in front of them, about taking care of their family.

22:48.800 --> 23:01.075
And in that same instance, you have no idea who's going to shoot at you, and you have no idea who the real enemy is, because you can't discern them between the civilian and the local population.

23:01.095 --> 23:04.860
So from that little snapshot, it's identical.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.602
But the other difference is,

23:06.582 --> 23:09.865
Gosh, how well they're taken care of here.

23:09.885 --> 23:14.990
I don't have running rats underneath my skids in my tent.

23:15.270 --> 23:26.140
I don't have standing out in the rain lathered up getting a shower out there, so it's amazing the things that they have here.

23:26.580 --> 23:27.361
Tremendous.

23:27.381 --> 23:29.883
I just have to believe the kind of flying that you do.

23:29.903 --> 23:34.868
There's never any margin for error anyway, but I imagine that

23:34.848 --> 23:37.331
It's kind of multiplied by 10 or 20.

23:37.351 --> 23:45.962
Yeah, you've got to be focused because it's not much higher than the ceiling as fast as the aircraft would go.

23:46.422 --> 23:48.625
But that's what makes it time.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.949
That's what makes it time go quick.

23:51.969 --> 23:52.529
I'm sorry, the end?

23:52.550 --> 23:53.110
No, no, no.

23:53.230 --> 23:57.075
I was going to say I'm surrounded by probably the best

23:57.275 --> 24:02.642
youngest, best talent the Army has in aviation, and I don't see myself old.

24:02.822 --> 24:08.610
I see everybody else surrounding me, and so I'm still young at heart doing that.

24:08.630 --> 24:11.253
Plus, it keeps you wired up doing that all the time.

24:11.714 --> 24:18.623
I mean, you have to... It's kind of like doing your exercise daily.

24:18.643 --> 24:25.712
You don't grow any complex, and I think it's... I'm so fortunate to be physically able to do all that.

24:25.962 --> 24:30.207
It's the best thing I've ever done in my life.

24:31.048 --> 24:34.072
How long do you think you'll be doing this?

24:34.312 --> 24:35.374
Well, when I turn 60, I'm gone.

24:35.614 --> 24:39.799
So you think that you'll be playing for two more years?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.141
Oh, definitely.

24:41.161 --> 24:44.485
Let's become physically stopped.

24:44.645 --> 24:45.806
It hasn't happened yet.

24:46.367 --> 24:48.730
Do you have a rough idea of how many hours you've got?

24:49.013 --> 24:53.100
About 18,000 hours.

24:54.603 --> 24:54.944
Wow.

24:54.964 --> 25:00.273
And how many different kind of aircraft would you say you've flown?

25:00.433 --> 25:08.367
I'm guessing both civilian and military, probably 20 different fixed-wing and probably the same.

25:08.387 --> 25:13.857
40 different types of aircraft.

25:14.697 --> 25:16.881
You've probably driven those many cars.

25:17.442 --> 25:21.089
I mean, the only difference is where the windshield wiper is at or the blinker.

25:21.169 --> 25:22.531
It goes down the road the same way.

25:22.972 --> 25:31.227
The steering wheel and the pedal, it might handle a little differently, but, you know, that's... And I'll bet the trick is you never take it for granted.

25:31.348 --> 25:32.149
No, you can't.

25:32.720 --> 25:46.246
You're kind of like a pretty girl.

25:46.807 --> 25:54.542
Any observations on the kind of work you're doing here?

25:54.522 --> 26:10.807
Yeah, well, there's missions where I'm taking crates of blood where it's needed, food and things that they can't get there, and it's the safest way to travel, just like it is in the States.

26:10.947 --> 26:13.371
It's safer to fly than it is to drive.

26:13.611 --> 26:16.316
And so you feel good about that.

26:16.376 --> 26:19.180
What I really feel good, and I call them kids, and they're not, but they're

26:19.160 --> 26:24.908
20s and 30s is showing them all the different techniques when I'm gone.

26:25.068 --> 26:33.460
Not that I'm going to make that much difference, but showing them the easy way of staying alive as opposed to letting them copy the mistakes that we did way back when.

26:33.821 --> 26:39.649
And Vietnam is kind of a Darwinian thing because we didn't have a lot of SOPs and things.

26:39.669 --> 26:45.738
The SOPs, the procedures of how we do things now, is basically written in the blood from the guys that flew in Vietnam.

26:45.758 --> 26:46.399
Written in blood.

26:46.379 --> 26:47.841
You know what SOP is, right?

26:47.861 --> 26:50.123
A standard operating machine.

26:50.143 --> 26:52.066
Do you know where Bravo Zulu is?

26:52.686 --> 26:53.507
I'm a Navy guy.

26:53.848 --> 26:55.450
Aren't they Bravo Zulu?

26:55.570 --> 26:58.153
Does that mean you lose here?

26:58.213 --> 27:00.015
Nothing like Tango Uniform.

27:00.095 --> 27:00.356
No.

27:00.676 --> 27:02.798
No, where it comes from is the signal flags.

27:03.279 --> 27:07.664
If you run Bravo Zulu up on the Yard Arms, it means Bravo Zulu, well done.

27:08.045 --> 27:09.006
And I use it at an L.A.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.729
Times page, and I figured everybody in the world knew what it was.

27:11.789 --> 27:12.570
I got some questions.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.053
What the hell does Bravo Zulu mean, you know?

27:15.303 --> 27:22.415
I was talking about my own ship, the original, which is, its career is going to be a smart day.

27:22.435 --> 27:30.189
Yeah, that's a name, but if you do a Google, just do Bravo Zoom, and it'll come up, and it'll tell you it's the international signal for well-dying.

27:30.229 --> 27:34.236
Do it, just do a Google, just write in Bravo Zoom, and it'll come up.

27:34.256 --> 27:37.101
And I figure, well, if that's what it comes up, then they don't understand it.

27:37.121 --> 27:38.323
The pilot would know.

27:38.590 --> 27:41.172
You said you landed on the aircraft carrier, right?

27:41.312 --> 27:42.614
Well, it landed on the river.

27:42.634 --> 27:44.816
It's never an aircraft carrier.

27:44.936 --> 27:47.218
Landed on there to resupply.

27:47.398 --> 27:55.225
You could only put your skids down a little bit as they moved down the river when we picked up people that were hurt or whatever.

27:55.986 --> 27:59.969
Because if you put all your weight of the aircraft on, you'd sink it.

28:00.109 --> 28:04.593
And what's the identity of the unit that you fly with here?

28:04.613 --> 28:08.597
It's the 3rd Battalion 135th Aviation Regiment under the 101st Airborne.

28:08.577 --> 28:12.225
So you are an Army pilot?

28:12.305 --> 28:14.270
Yes, sir.

28:14.370 --> 28:19.722
I think people would probably be surprised to learn that the Army has more pilots than any of the services.

28:19.742 --> 28:26.316
It has more ships and it has more trains and more, I mean, people are surprised to find that we have

28:26.498 --> 28:52.590
army people pilots and captains on ships that now that surprises me we have in fact here in the tigris river we have an army detachment that's moving boats and keeping floating bridges going across keeping the traffic pretty neat stuff and how is your your mission here defined how do they define taking uh

28:52.925 --> 29:06.525
all needs, either personnel or parts or blood or other essential places to the other bases, quickly and safely.

29:06.545 --> 29:12.073
Do you have a rough idea of how many of these you've done since you've been here?

29:12.093 --> 29:12.313
Roughly.

29:12.573 --> 29:13.214
It's two pounds.

29:13.234 --> 29:14.376
Oh, yeah, I know it.

29:14.558 --> 29:18.523
It's about 70 hours of flying, so four or five stops apiece.

29:18.623 --> 29:20.465
I've only been here a few months.

29:20.485 --> 29:22.307
So when did you start here?

29:22.387 --> 29:28.835
Started here in January and actually started to fly first of February.

29:29.195 --> 29:30.677
Got all the paperwork and stuff going.

29:30.697 --> 29:33.180
And the tour here is for how long?

29:33.660 --> 29:35.382
A year.

29:35.402 --> 29:40.368
And you're from Missouri and where is home now?

29:41.710 --> 29:41.950
Springfield.

29:41.930 --> 29:49.612
And what I do there full-time is I'm a test pilot and a aviation safety officer Monday, Tuesday, Friday.

29:49.732 --> 29:51.216
And do you have a family back there?

29:51.236 --> 29:51.497
We do.

29:51.517 --> 29:55.749
I've got a family and got a horse and cattle ranch my family has.

29:55.769 --> 29:56.952
And when I retire,

29:56.932 --> 30:00.295
I'm part of the Navy part that I've always wanted to do.

30:00.315 --> 30:03.297
I'm solo self-navigating the world in a sailboat.

30:03.378 --> 30:03.838
Wow.

30:04.198 --> 30:05.680
That's my big chore.

30:05.800 --> 30:13.066
I've got an ocean-going sailboat, so as soon as I get a chance to get out of this in two years, that's my next goal.

30:13.206 --> 30:17.290
And how long are we going to do an exercise like that?

30:17.390 --> 30:18.991
About 18 to 20 minutes.

30:19.011 --> 30:20.292
And it's going to be solo.

30:20.392 --> 30:20.753
Oh, yeah.

30:20.773 --> 30:23.635
My wife works.

30:23.975 --> 30:25.977
She's going to send me the checks.

30:26.193 --> 30:28.575
Well, what does she think about all this?

30:28.893 --> 30:36.720
Well, she's going to meet me at various places, fly out and say hi, and she knows that it's been a lifetime goal.

30:37.781 --> 30:42.605
And she's an accomplished sailor, too, but she'll join me one day.

30:42.625 --> 30:48.049
So where did the guy from Missouri learn how to sail in an ocean-going sailboat?

30:48.169 --> 30:56.036
Well, we've got one of the top ten sailing lakes in the United States is at Stockton Lake, just because of the way it's shaped.

30:57.117 --> 30:58.258
We've got...

30:58.238 --> 31:05.429
A little over 400 members in our yacht car, but probably 200 boats or 30 foot or greater sailboats.

31:05.549 --> 31:08.453
And how long do you anticipate such a trip?

31:08.554 --> 31:09.876
Is that 18 months?

31:09.896 --> 31:12.580
18 to 22 months, depending on how long they stay.

31:12.760 --> 31:18.188
And how long do you, when you do a port call, I mean, how long do you, how much time do you spend until you get bored?

31:18.353 --> 31:22.617
That's what retirement's about, I think.

31:22.657 --> 31:24.659
So you don't mind your own company.

31:26.161 --> 31:30.004
That's the hardest person to get along with.

31:30.024 --> 31:33.428
That's quite a guy.

31:33.448 --> 31:36.110
Have you done a story on him yet?

31:36.130 --> 31:39.013
You're going to let me make sure I get a copy of it.

31:39.033 --> 31:45.219
And maybe we can get another picture so we're not stuck with the trays.

31:45.239 --> 31:46.200
Let me tell you something else.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.242
For the first time, I went by his tooth.

31:49.133 --> 31:54.393
Because I thought he was going to be flying me tomorrow, flying us, if I end up going.

31:54.493 --> 32:00.797
And in his little room, she's got a table, and he's got all these things of sweat.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.683
I said, what the hell is that?

32:04.984 --> 32:05.604
Were you a seamstress?

32:05.784 --> 32:08.087
He said, no, I'm making fishing flies.

32:08.107 --> 32:10.390
He's got a thing and he's sitting there.

32:10.410 --> 32:15.295
So you've got a guy sitting in the middle of the desert making fishing flies for fishers.

32:15.395 --> 32:17.998
And I said, we needed that for the store.

32:18.058 --> 32:22.363
That's the kind of human interest color that I think is important.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.765
And it's fascinating.

32:23.785 --> 32:25.907
He showed me one or two of his little flies in there.

32:25.887 --> 32:27.649
Now, have you ever caught anything with those?

32:27.850 --> 32:28.651
Oh, always.

32:28.671 --> 32:30.513
I wouldn't buy them if I couldn't.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.796
That would be a waste of time.

32:32.816 --> 32:39.946
I mean, there are guys that make flies, and they don't even fish, but the Trucette is probably out of the making.

32:39.966 --> 32:42.649
So what's your specialty?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.972
What's your favorite fly that you make?

32:44.992 --> 32:48.537
Well, the Royal Wolf, or the Griffith, or just your...

32:48.517 --> 33:12.853
basic stone flying them right and nobody fishes out here in the iraqi desert right i haven't i'd be afraid that he puts out here in the tigers i'm not sure what they've got i had fish from the tigers last week really okay in barrage amazing no this was over this was with the iraqi soldiers that i went on the convoy with imagine what's in that water

33:12.833 --> 33:14.096
But you know what?

33:14.356 --> 33:18.004
They had the two fish there, and you reach in with your hand, and you pick it up.

33:18.024 --> 33:18.926
It was delicious.

33:19.006 --> 33:20.169
You ate it.

33:20.189 --> 33:22.053
It was delicious.

33:22.173 --> 33:23.255
And he's still here, Nick.

33:23.275 --> 33:23.977
That's the testament.

33:23.997 --> 33:24.819
He's still here.

33:24.839 --> 33:27.986
If you do that for a year, you might have three heads.

33:28.126 --> 33:28.667
I don't know.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.812
Life is full of rest.

33:30.932 --> 33:33.357
It would have been very ungracious.

33:33.337 --> 33:34.038
Oh, no.

33:34.138 --> 33:35.801
It was delicious.

33:35.841 --> 33:39.907
You couldn't tell me what kind of fish it was, but it was excellent.

33:39.947 --> 33:40.628
That's amazing.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.390
So I've eaten fish from the Tigers.

33:42.491 --> 33:44.794
In fact, you've drinking water from the Tigers.

33:44.814 --> 33:45.475
Oh, yes.

33:45.755 --> 33:54.248
Because the water that we bottled in the... I'm sure it's been... No, it's been perfectly... We have a water bottling plant here, and I got to go through with a reporter

33:54.228 --> 34:12.591
and listen to them explain how it's actually cleaner than most bottled water in the united states but that water comes out of tiger's river and i think that's really neat to be drinking water from tiger's river

34:12.571 --> 34:15.936
Yeah, she said that that way I wouldn't have other women on it.

34:16.156 --> 34:19.942
But I told her since we're down here in the Ozarks, Gary, you forgot one thing.

34:19.962 --> 34:21.504
These women in the Ozarks can't read.

34:26.111 --> 34:27.533
He's going to use that line.

34:27.633 --> 34:31.518
It's my mother.

34:31.538 --> 34:31.879
It's my mother.

34:31.899 --> 34:33.221
Did I miss anything, Brian?

34:34.583 --> 34:36.486
What do we know about sheep that he used to?

34:36.986 --> 34:38.849
Things I don't want to talk about.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.992
What was the nickname they gave you on that board?

34:41.157 --> 34:42.699
What was the thing they wrote on the board?

34:43.200 --> 34:46.304
In his flight office they have a board and they all write these jokes on and off.

34:47.004 --> 34:47.906
You were down at the bottom.

34:47.926 --> 34:49.187
They gave everybody nicknames.

34:49.267 --> 34:50.008
What was your nickname?

34:50.048 --> 34:51.230
It wasn't a nickname.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.932
It was rumors to be Squash.

34:52.952 --> 34:55.395
And what was the rumor about you that was supposed to be Squash?

34:55.555 --> 34:57.738
Somebody put on here that I was related to Wilbur Wright.

34:59.180 --> 35:03.165
The guy that taught me how to fly, the guy that taught me how to fly,

35:03.145 --> 35:16.067
He was a World War II Army Air Corps instructor, a civilian, but he got taught by a guy named Major Barrier right after World War I, who was taught by the Global Riders.

35:16.087 --> 35:19.833
There were just a couple to move from aviation.

35:19.893 --> 35:24.681
But isn't that something, Ben, that you can actually establish like a direct link there?

35:26.112 --> 35:28.634
Which must be horrible, right?

35:28.694 --> 35:37.062
Do you have anything that you could tell us about maybe anything that's caused the most panic since you've been here?

35:37.163 --> 35:47.753
Well, just yesterday, all my navigation equipment as I was going to our crew just dropped offline and we were close to the Iranian border.

35:47.773 --> 35:53.318
And the first thought that went through my mind is that, you know, I hate to end my career being the first.

35:53.703 --> 35:58.735
aircraft shot down by Iran here in this breakage.

35:58.985 --> 36:04.634
Then we climbed out and I was just using my mag compass and the radios were going out.

36:04.754 --> 36:12.406
So after a little bit of panic, I finally got ahold of somebody who gave me a direction and a distance of Y2.

36:14.109 --> 36:18.936
We used the old stone method of using an E6B or a little whiz wheel.

36:18.956 --> 36:20.358
So yeah, it's got to be this heading.

36:20.418 --> 36:23.944
When we landed, the low field light came on.

36:23.964 --> 36:27.169
It's a little about 100 miles away, but it kind of was making me

36:27.149 --> 36:32.458
I had some of those moments of trepidation that I had in Vietnam trying to figure out where the heck is going.

36:32.518 --> 36:34.461
And that's what I was saying.

36:34.481 --> 36:36.404
We've automated ourselves into the Stone Age.

36:36.424 --> 36:39.850
We have this flight management system that does all this neat stuff.

36:40.611 --> 36:44.458
And when it craps out, it's like, OK, guys.

36:44.478 --> 36:47.082
Of course, the kids aren't used to this, you know.

36:47.062 --> 36:54.518
going across the ocean with a kind of what's your whistle and head out that way, but it works out.

36:54.538 --> 36:56.142
It was always an exciting day yesterday.

36:56.282 --> 36:59.730
Yeah, it made me tucker a little bit, thinking that, you know.

36:59.910 --> 37:03.518
And the worst humiliation wasn't crashing in the desert.

37:03.498 --> 37:14.149
trying to chase down the camel for a ride was the humiliation of coming back and having the rest of the pilots give you a load of crap for losing an aircraft in the desert.

37:14.189 --> 37:17.133
That's a great story.

37:17.173 --> 37:19.535
But they fixed it, and they said it was right.

37:19.555 --> 37:25.462
They brought all the mechanics in, replaced all the black boxes, and swore to me that it was going to work.

37:25.482 --> 37:27.784
And I did make the mechanics fly with me that said that.

37:27.764 --> 37:32.752
And halfway home it broke again, so we had to do the whole thing over again.

37:33.793 --> 37:36.718
And that's why it came from the Virgin Islands.

37:37.139 --> 37:39.362
I accused it of having some kind of voodoo curse on it.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.567
There's something that's making it crazy.

37:42.587 --> 37:44.210
That's a great story.

37:44.230 --> 37:45.632
He's a great story.

37:47.114 --> 37:47.595
Isn't he great?

37:47.862 --> 37:49.446
Minty beer.

37:50.990 --> 37:52.213
Oh, we got some guys.

37:52.233 --> 37:54.218
That was just minty beers.

37:54.238 --> 37:58.309
You know, the kids always have something they're working on since there's no alcohol.

37:58.730 --> 38:03.863
There's some of our rocket scientists that are trying to figure out how to distill scope.

38:04.113 --> 38:05.414
Because you know you've been on the Navy.

38:05.755 --> 38:09.498
They get the alcohol out of it to put it back in and it ain't here for your ear.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.701
And all they've got is right now they come up with it.

38:11.861 --> 38:13.783
It tastes like minty beer.

38:13.803 --> 38:15.224
It tastes like mouthwashed beer.

38:15.865 --> 38:19.829
But anyway, it's given them something to do to pass the time to see if they can come up with something.

38:20.009 --> 38:25.434
So how do you feel about that service where they live all the time?

38:25.494 --> 38:29.438
For an Irishman, it's really tough.

38:29.478 --> 38:31.420
My liver's not right.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.504
He asked if I was going to fly until 60.

38:33.525 --> 38:36.852
I don't know, after a year's sobriety.

38:36.872 --> 38:43.325
What was the identification of the unit that you served with in Vietnam?

38:43.345 --> 38:45.530
It was the 162nd Assault Helicopter Company.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.915
We were copperhead gunships.

38:47.935 --> 38:48.677
You go out of where?

38:48.817 --> 38:51.703
Dong Cam and Canto.

38:52.156 --> 38:54.622
And what was the slogan of that and of that outfit?

38:54.642 --> 38:56.146
Die, bastards, die.

38:56.206 --> 38:57.208
Die, bastards, die.

38:57.228 --> 38:58.631
What's the slogan now created?

38:59.173 --> 39:01.218
The slogan, yeah, that's what they had on it.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.280
They made us take it away.

39:02.320 --> 39:08.415
Our patch and our unit resides in Fort Hood, Texas.

39:08.956 --> 39:10.620
I tracked it down.

39:10.600 --> 39:17.309
And I don't know what they put on the patch, whether it's more politically correct than what we used to have on our passage.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.071
So you don't even know what it is now?

39:19.151 --> 39:23.036
It's Copperheads, but it's not Die Bastards Die, I can assure you.

39:23.076 --> 39:23.978
So which one do you like?

39:23.998 --> 39:25.199
Which one do you prefer?

39:25.219 --> 39:28.323
I like War's Hell, Die Bastards Die.

39:28.664 --> 39:30.867
It's just like Patton said.

39:30.887 --> 39:35.913
It's not you dying for your company, it's making the other stupid bastard die.

39:36.033 --> 39:37.555
That's Patton, that's right.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.717
George Patton.

39:38.697 --> 39:41.043
I remember in Vietnam.

39:41.123 --> 39:43.709
I went into Vietnam a couple of times.

39:43.850 --> 39:49.083
I remember there was the Smokies.

39:49.183 --> 39:55.238
They said, only you can prevent forests.

39:55.218 --> 40:07.416
Keith, how many other Vietnam vets do you think is serving right here?

40:08.036 --> 40:16.028
How many have you run into?

40:16.244 --> 40:23.039
I think there's, well, I know there's one, I know for sure there's one more that's, well, actually two more.

40:23.059 --> 40:27.169
There's a sergeant major and one of the pilots.

40:27.189 --> 40:29.213
In your battalion.

40:29.233 --> 40:32.882
So you have at least two others that are in your battalion.

40:32.962 --> 40:33.122
Correct.

40:33.102 --> 40:41.378
My guys that I've talked to occasionally that was in my unit, they kind of lost track and they're just remarked.

40:41.398 --> 40:43.743
They just can't believe it.

40:43.763 --> 40:44.584
Still doing it.

40:44.604 --> 40:45.085
And it is.

40:45.166 --> 40:48.632
It's as much fun as it was when I started flying.

40:48.732 --> 40:49.113
It is.

40:50.135 --> 40:51.077
Is that the thing?

40:51.057 --> 41:04.518
No, I really believe that God has given each one of us a talent that nobody else has ever been here before or ever going to be can do.

41:05.079 --> 41:10.628
And the task is to do it as good as you can and share that with everybody else.

41:10.648 --> 41:13.593
And I owned and operated my own restaurants.

41:13.673 --> 41:14.734
I'm a trained chef.

41:14.754 --> 41:16.457
I had some great concepts.

41:16.859 --> 41:22.247
Some of the best restaurants in Kansas City.

41:22.268 --> 41:27.936
The American Restaurant, one of the top 10 restaurants in the United States, down half of Walmart Cart.

41:28.017 --> 41:32.183
Had me run it for him, and some of my consultants were Chef Grandola, Craig Claiborne, James Muir, Barbara Kafka.

41:32.203 --> 41:36.490
So I've worked with the Creme de la Creme, and that was, what was the name of the restaurant?

41:36.610 --> 41:37.171
The American Restaurant.

41:37.191 --> 41:42.259
And I was, at the top of my peak, I was very fortunate to be, and I still was fine.

41:42.442 --> 41:50.930
But I found out early in life that I got a coffee cup that said that success is loving what you do.

41:50.950 --> 41:53.232
And I was very successful doing that.

41:53.492 --> 41:55.314
I was good at motivating people under stress.

41:55.334 --> 41:58.857
Of course, that was probably my origins in Vietnam.

41:58.957 --> 42:01.940
Part of the thing is I absolutely loved watching kids learn to walk.

42:01.960 --> 42:09.327
I can remember how great it was when I was taught by this older gentleman, even though I used to cuss, smoke the cigar, and throw things at me when I did it wrong.

42:09.307 --> 42:11.090
But I expected it.

42:11.110 --> 42:22.109
What was the most important piece of advice you ever received from a mentor, and what's the most important piece of advice that you've tested?

42:22.129 --> 42:24.954
Well, it can only come with one.

42:24.974 --> 42:27.158
Part of that is you never stop working.

42:27.178 --> 42:33.188
As I go on with that, if you get good at something and just become a comfortable niche,

42:33.168 --> 42:42.877
and you don't continue pursuing it, and you're working and studying it, then you're doing yourself and the rest of the people in your field in this service.

42:43.117 --> 43:02.736
It took me almost 30 years when I was really good, and that's 30 years, which is about, and I started in 64, so about 94, to get to like an ant crawling on the table to find it when I was really good, I mean, physically able, and I wasn't caught up in a lot of other things I am now,

43:03.425 --> 43:05.208
I was like an ant on this table.

43:05.228 --> 43:10.097
I could only identify the periphery and the knowledge I didn't know about in the field of endeavor.

43:10.197 --> 43:13.504
It took me that long to figure out what I didn't know.

43:13.684 --> 43:20.877
But it was a great confidence builder because you could send me out and do anything because I could identify what I didn't know about in the field.

43:20.857 --> 43:24.203
I could mitigate my risk and I felt very confident.

43:24.284 --> 43:25.907
I knew I could do it.

43:26.127 --> 43:29.554
Now the guys will go out and say, yeah, I can do it.

43:29.574 --> 43:32.078
And then they get up there going, holy cow, now we're like, you know.

43:32.259 --> 43:35.685
But I think that's just continuing working at your field.

43:35.705 --> 43:40.755
Don't let yourself just kind of atrophy and slide off into a board.

43:40.735 --> 43:45.986
and then train and share that with other people.

43:46.006 --> 43:49.795
And when did you have time to go in a restaurant in Kansas City?

43:49.815 --> 43:56.649
I was in the National Guard from 70 and I, like I said, I was always in the restaurant business with my family.

43:56.770 --> 44:00.718
And so I did that for quite a while.

44:00.698 --> 44:21.998
that's right but i work full-time for the guard as a military technician as a test pilot so back in 85 i had an opportunity to walk out of this field i kind of had an epiphany i got a big divorce i was making tons of money i would have been a retired millionaire but

44:21.978 --> 44:41.310
I probably would have died at a younger age, but I'm extremely fortunate to be able to walk out of the top of this career and ride into another field of endeavor that I had been doing ever since.

44:41.330 --> 44:42.011
And so, I absolutely love it.

44:42.031 --> 44:43.193
It keeps me young, keeps me on my toes.

44:43.173 --> 45:06.300
It works the heck out.

45:06.320 --> 45:06.541
It's crazy.

45:06.561 --> 45:09.044
Aside from the smoking and the drinking, what's the biggest change in the military that you've seen back in the 60s and now?

45:09.064 --> 45:10.986
What I see now, and you will relate to this, is in the 60s and us, we did everything communally.

45:10.966 --> 45:19.879
If there's four or five of us playing cribbage or cards, there was 20 others sitting around watching, and there was a constant chatter and talk.

45:20.981 --> 45:24.947
If one went to eat, we all went to eat.

45:24.967 --> 45:30.535
It was a group thing because we were all in the entertainment, and there was a lot more interaction between us.

45:30.555 --> 45:32.518
Now I see the kids in our units.

45:33.612 --> 45:35.535
They're incredibly talented.

45:35.775 --> 45:38.420
When you walk, there's hardly any eye contact.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.904
They all got their iPods in.

45:41.464 --> 45:42.807
They're on email.

45:42.827 --> 45:44.930
They come home.

45:45.070 --> 45:46.172
They're on their DVD.

45:46.192 --> 45:47.414
They're insular.

45:47.694 --> 45:50.399
They're cocooned inside their own world.

45:50.479 --> 45:57.510
Not that they don't relate, but it's amazing in the last few years how I've seen this grow even more

45:57.490 --> 46:05.530
We pass without seeing people.

46:06.773 --> 46:12.968
We pass without recognizing emotions or anything.

46:12.948 --> 46:16.615
And so I see that difference.

46:16.635 --> 46:27.714
And the automation, like I said, I see when it stops, like when our power stops over there, we have an incredible system that I wish we had when we were in Vietnam.

46:27.895 --> 46:32.623
But when the power stops, we basically automate ourselves.

46:32.743 --> 46:36.610
And it's amazing to watch because we forgot how to sit down and do

46:36.826 --> 47:00.657
long division in math and generate stuff out real quick because how we used to do it more than that because we're used to just inputting keystroke boom and it doesn't work for that and so there's some of that and i think from doing it that long way you have an insightful idea of how the results should be as opposed to the google answer you have no idea how it's going to come out

47:00.637 --> 47:04.202
So that's what it is.

47:04.502 --> 47:08.288
That's very perceptive.

47:08.348 --> 47:08.889
I've got it.

47:09.009 --> 47:10.130
I want to make sure.

47:10.150 --> 47:14.396
Chief, I've forgotten about the navigation of the globe.

47:14.496 --> 47:18.542
Chief, just tell me again the parallels between what you were just telling me outside.

47:18.983 --> 47:19.624
What's that, sir?

47:19.684 --> 47:23.409
Oh, for the parallels between flying and sailing.

47:23.810 --> 47:24.971
Well, it's identical.

47:24.991 --> 47:30.559
The aerodynamic qualities of the sailor, the airfoil of an aircraft,

47:31.113 --> 47:37.843
And it's like sailing on the water without any—it's flying on the water without any noise.

47:38.124 --> 47:44.493
So, to me, it's a continuation of my flying.

47:45.395 --> 47:46.917
And most pilots are multicast.

47:47.317 --> 47:52.986
They like to be fidgeting with stuff, so sailing gives you a chance to change the camber of the sail and the angle.

47:53.337 --> 47:56.301
You fiddle around with everything else while people are sitting there watching.

47:56.321 --> 48:02.629
You steer with your feet, and you're doing that, and everybody's having a nice cocktail enjoying themselves.

48:02.689 --> 48:05.954
Then I asked you the kinds of things you think about when you're up there.

48:06.274 --> 48:10.039
You said even flying here, you were flying over it.

48:10.379 --> 48:21.454
I was looking at the civilization here and realizing that the reason this didn't have any architectural significance is because there was a lack of access to quarried stone here.

48:21.839 --> 48:47.458
all they have is rubble rock and adobe so if it was somewhere else where they had they had the manpower looking at the places like the ziggurat that reconstruction but they didn't have any access to cord stone within easy reach you see that is so pertinent because when you think of uh writing begins here correct and the cuneiform but the whole essence of cuneiform it's in it's in

48:47.793 --> 48:48.715
Clay tablets.

48:48.735 --> 48:49.616
Clay tablets.

48:49.636 --> 48:52.241
Because they didn't have rock.

48:52.281 --> 48:55.107
They had the papyrus, but they didn't have the process.

48:55.227 --> 49:04.384
And the word cuneiform means wedge shape, by the way, because that's the only way you could take that stylus and put it into the wet clay and wedge it and make these characters.

49:04.955 --> 49:08.501
And yet this is where it begins, with the simplest of ingredients, isn't it?

49:08.782 --> 49:16.756
Yes, the cuneiform and the Arabic, the numeric system, and they had the concept of zero that nobody else did.

49:16.776 --> 49:20.723
But had they had quarried stone, do you think the writing would have begun as it did?

49:20.924 --> 49:22.607
Do you think they would have found another medium?

49:23.248 --> 49:24.510
Well, I don't know.

49:24.651 --> 49:29.359
You know, another thing that's really amazing is that

49:29.896 --> 49:48.415
This is on another area, but they do an RNA when they were checking, like, the descendants of Eve when they were going through RNA, which was passed on by the mother, and checking the different societies and how they migrated across where they thought from Africa and out through the hemisphere.

49:48.996 --> 49:58.165
But they found here recently the two closest related people, or actually the one closest related people to the Greek civilization is the Navajo Indians.

49:58.448 --> 50:01.654
almost a direct 99.99% descendant.

50:01.894 --> 50:13.475
So if you think about this, here's the cradle of civilization in Greek, and they split, they figured, around 12,000 to 14,000 years ago, and one crossed the land bridge.

50:13.495 --> 50:19.967
So it had to be the nomadic lifestyle and the easy source of protein that caused the...

50:20.538 --> 50:25.045
the one civilization this spring, and the other one still a great civilization.

50:25.065 --> 50:28.491
It's funny, when you look at the Navajo Indians and the Greeks, you can see the similarities.

50:28.551 --> 50:30.614
But isn't that an amazing thing?

50:30.935 --> 50:35.141
I'm of Greek descent, by the way, so it's sad that I've never heard this people.

50:35.161 --> 50:42.072
Well, this was just recently published in the Scientific American magazine about four months ago.

50:42.433 --> 50:45.718
And so I went on that thought about, isn't that amazing that...

50:45.952 --> 51:09.090
maybe it was an easy source of protein on the mediterranean that caused them to have more time to build the structures and generate a society with the same genetic trait then elsewhere and are these some of the things that occupy your thoughts when you're up there flying these aircraft yeah some of them
