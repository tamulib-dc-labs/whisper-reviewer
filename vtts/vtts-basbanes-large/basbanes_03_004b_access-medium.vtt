WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:04.471
Why don't we just say it for the take?

00:04.491 --> 00:05.191
What is it?

00:05.312 --> 00:06.613
What's the title of the book?

00:06.633 --> 00:08.034
The Reflections I'm not seeing on it.

00:08.114 --> 00:08.475
Okay.

00:08.935 --> 00:10.877
That and another book called Types of Shape.

00:11.057 --> 00:11.157
Okay.

00:11.177 --> 00:15.342
That's just for my take, McCoy, which didn't hear what the book was.

00:15.362 --> 00:18.024
There's another book called Types of Shape, which you want.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.946
Shape of Hope.

00:19.966 --> 00:22.709
And your breath did in subsequent expansion.

00:23.330 --> 00:28.435
But I was very grateful to bring this back because it had...

00:29.495 --> 00:36.548
never appeared in paper, although it appeared in the whole issue of magazine poetry back in the 1970s.

00:36.568 --> 00:40.936
So that's a 30-year-old book which is now just being issued in paper, is that right?

00:40.956 --> 00:41.938
A few years ago, yes.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.521
That's pretty interesting.

00:43.541 --> 00:44.543
You say it's fascinating.

00:44.643 --> 00:45.665
Did you have a question?

00:45.946 --> 00:47.689
Well, it's fascinating.

00:47.669 --> 00:51.254
to me in my own work with this idea of the code name.

00:51.434 --> 01:01.448
And the work that I'm looking at for my own research, a lot of the women I'm looking at were nationalist militant women in the revolution who used nom de guerre.

01:01.528 --> 01:01.769
Yeah.

01:02.049 --> 01:05.354
And then they used their nom de guerre.

01:05.734 --> 01:07.096
That's nom de guerre.

01:07.116 --> 01:07.296
Yes.

01:07.316 --> 01:16.009
And I thought that was a really interesting aspect of your book that made it to my own.

01:16.029 --> 01:16.189
Oh, yes.

01:16.209 --> 01:16.309
Amen.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.407
There's some... Is that your credit?

01:21.427 --> 01:21.508
Yes.

01:21.528 --> 01:23.110
Would you like me to sign it to you?

01:23.130 --> 01:23.932
Oh, sure.

01:23.952 --> 01:24.573
I'd like that.

01:24.953 --> 01:33.127
There are some... some tiny bits of French influence on that, certainly.

01:33.147 --> 01:37.694
And the chars, I'll tell you, deep notes.

01:37.935 --> 01:40.258
Something that I've read.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.123
Long, long, long talk about it.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.135
Do you have it?

01:45.155 --> 01:45.896
I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:45.916 --> 01:49.141
No, you can get back in and more of those things.

01:49.201 --> 01:56.773
Look, this is a totally poetic fiction, because it's not about... Did you say that you read me in production?

01:56.793 --> 01:59.017
Yes, that's what I mean.

01:59.037 --> 02:03.644
You said the spooky thing about being hard to find.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:05.075 --> 02:15.607
One of the other things that I thought was really interesting about it was the way that you shared it as you were writing it and sent it.

02:15.627 --> 02:21.173
It was very important for me at the time.

02:21.353 --> 02:27.680
I started writing it when I was feeling very long for a number of reasons.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.462
That's why it starts out after that.

02:30.725 --> 02:50.005
And I just wanted to get myself to write, and I've never been able to write every day, and I've never been able to keep a journal longer than three days.

02:50.025 --> 02:53.028
And this was a sort of nutty way of doing that.

02:54.770 --> 02:59.215
You know, it's a book I'm very fond of.

02:59.235 --> 03:00.276
Tell me the title again.

03:00.442 --> 03:01.924
Reflection.

03:02.024 --> 03:04.367
Reflections on Espionage.

03:04.387 --> 03:07.191
And what's significant about the title? 

03:07.291 --> 03:09.253
It's one of the book's themes.

03:10.155 --> 03:12.518
[Mumbling.]

03:12.538 --> 03:15.401
It's a long poem. 

03:23.212 --> 03:29.900
You might find it most...

03:30.985 --> 03:37.473
I was grateful to the press for Graham for doing a whole sequence.

03:37.513 --> 04:00.402
When I did come back, Ellen Graham persuaded me to do what was, I suppose, the most successful book financially in the press, which is book of Ron's Reason, which is

04:04.533 --> 04:20.338
It's a little handbook of poetic forms and devices, not only English poetry that includes other languages.

04:20.999 --> 04:28.110
The one difference being that each one of them is illustrated.

04:28.867 --> 04:36.275
by an example that I had written, and each example explains itself.

04:36.295 --> 04:40.980
So that the one that explains how a villanelle works is a villain.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.646
The one that explains how a sestino works is a sestino.

04:46.666 --> 04:51.531
A short passage of lists is a ray word.

04:51.692 --> 04:56.697
And it's been around

04:58.060 --> 05:02.747
three editions and many, many great things for 25 years.

05:03.708 --> 05:08.535
And it was Alan Graham's idea for me to do it.

05:08.555 --> 05:11.139
A trade press is not likely to do something.

05:11.179 --> 05:11.900
No, no, no.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.905
It's because it's an educational book.

05:14.925 --> 05:15.345
I mean, it's a text.

05:15.365 --> 05:15.986
Right.

05:16.006 --> 05:16.407
It was sold.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.753
You see, the university professors do have texts for it.

05:20.813 --> 05:26.802
They go to MLA meetings and sell books and things like that.

05:27.338 --> 05:31.764
So you said that was your most successful Gale book, right?

05:31.844 --> 05:36.029
Yes, it sold most copies over all those years.

05:36.750 --> 05:37.831
And how about something like this?

05:38.812 --> 05:41.556
I don't think that was funny.

05:41.616 --> 05:43.578
But it's probably one of the proudest.

05:44.600 --> 05:52.890
I don't think when it was published they marked it.

05:53.360 --> 06:00.545
I'm just simply glad to get it in paper, because course copies were very hard for them to wear.

06:00.926 --> 06:03.876
Is there a temptation when they bring it back to go back and redo it?

06:04.261 --> 06:07.805
to read to it, or does it speak from time to time that it was written?

06:07.825 --> 06:08.546
No, no, no.

06:08.666 --> 06:09.287
I added up.

06:09.507 --> 06:12.952
What I did was to... Do I jump in a... Yeah, I don't mind.

06:12.972 --> 06:13.232
Thank you.

06:13.692 --> 06:16.936
No, it was simply shot from the original book.

06:17.958 --> 06:22.183
But you didn't write any... Oh, yes, yes, yes.

06:22.383 --> 06:25.126
The text was shot from the original book.

06:25.146 --> 06:28.110
I see, but I mean, you didn't change the poem at all.

06:28.951 --> 06:29.712
No.

06:29.792 --> 06:30.393
That's what I meant.

06:30.733 --> 06:32.175
No, but I added...

06:32.442 --> 06:32.702
No.

06:32.722 --> 06:33.844
Oh, there's some apparatus.

06:34.004 --> 06:37.388
There was apparatus to begin with, and I added the apparatus.

06:37.408 --> 06:38.950
So they reset the apparatus.

06:39.490 --> 06:44.356
And then there was an explanatory introduction of some length, which I wanted.

06:45.518 --> 06:46.679
And they did that.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.763
I'm going to give you a pen so you can inscribe this to this young lady.

06:51.004 --> 06:51.785
She's Caroline.

06:52.726 --> 06:53.407
Yes.

06:53.487 --> 06:54.929
C-A-R-O-L-I-N-E, right?

06:54.949 --> 06:55.549
Yes.

06:56.330 --> 07:01.116
The real way.

07:11.187 --> 07:16.833
Is there anything, any burning questions?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.895
I mean, I've pretty much covered that.

07:18.915 --> 07:22.338
Thank you so much.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.659
Oh, my pleasure.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.024
I'm very lucky to have this here.

07:28.104 --> 07:31.327
Well, this must be fascinating for you.

07:32.288 --> 07:40.536
Because you're getting the stuff from, you know, you're getting the stuff that you would fully have gathered.

07:41.242 --> 07:49.075
over 20 years or more of being in the profession and picking it off.

07:49.495 --> 07:53.982
I want her to come to as many of these interviews as she can take.

07:54.003 --> 07:57.047
I want her to be involved in the project.

07:57.388 --> 08:08.025
I wanted to say, if I say it in that literature, again, to be candid, I did feel that after Ellen Graham left,

08:08.326 --> 08:13.433
the editors of literature went into a terrible decorum.

08:14.495 --> 08:18.280
And it lasted for quite a while.

08:18.961 --> 08:22.146
And they, of course, did wonderful other things in art, etc.

08:22.827 --> 08:33.122
But this was one of the other series, but this was not just... And now, there's a new editor in literature named John Kulka.

08:33.162 --> 08:34.043
K-U-L-K-A.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.467
So you're the second person now to tell you.

08:36.487 --> 08:38.029
He, I think, the world...

08:39.747 --> 08:50.321
He's incredibly impressive, and he's going to bring back the reputation that Neil Press had in the literature, certainly.

08:50.341 --> 08:55.808
Isn't this something, it's almost quaint, isn't it, in the 21st century, that we would be interested in the literature?

08:56.489 --> 08:58.292
Literature, the university press.

08:59.073 --> 09:03.198
And I love it, because I just don't know of any other university press where we could say that.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.300
Well, that'd be fine.

09:04.340 --> 09:04.740
Maybe LSU.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.042
Well, Princeton did.

09:06.528 --> 09:13.200
But then its editors went, and the most recent Princeton editors have not been said that Harvard, yes.

09:13.220 --> 09:22.857
There's one literature editor there, but he has particular views on things, and he publishes some marvelous things, but he's not very expensive.

09:22.877 --> 09:24.841
He's got a kind of tunnel vision.

09:24.861 --> 09:25.362
Chicago.

09:26.824 --> 09:28.367
Chicago Press has been

09:29.191 --> 09:41.969
two years intervening between her, and then even you, because it has one of the great literary editors there, and their literary editing is really superb.

09:43.451 --> 09:48.678
Can you think of some of her great tribes that you would particularly like to single out and take note of?

09:50.200 --> 09:55.868
Well, just simply the very, very high quality of everything she did over the years.

09:55.908 --> 09:58.371
I remember, for example, in one case,

10:00.427 --> 10:06.237
a man named Richard Peterson, who teaches at UConn, wrote a splendid book on Ben Jenison.

10:06.617 --> 10:18.356
And he had submitted it to Princeton, and it was accepted by the editor at Princeton, and finally, in the final layer of, at University Press, is the final layer of acceptance.

10:18.376 --> 10:19.859
It isn't up to the editor either.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.482
Here she gets the wedding.

10:22.183 --> 10:23.605
It's got to be the publication board.

10:24.346 --> 10:26.670
And one person on the publication board,

10:27.983 --> 10:32.027
I found out later who it was, and I was known to be a jerk anyway.

10:32.488 --> 10:34.370
It absolutely blocked.

10:34.730 --> 10:35.051
It's great.

10:35.071 --> 10:38.615
It absolutely blocked this.

10:38.635 --> 10:41.878
And Peterson was in despair, but he had friends here.

10:42.539 --> 10:48.065
And several of us went to Ellen Graham and said, Ellen, this marvelous book, pick it up first.

10:50.007 --> 10:51.369
From Princeton.

10:51.409 --> 10:56.134
And because she had benefited some of the Princeton vetting already,

10:56.620 --> 11:03.246
and had inside dope on the story of what happened, she was able to accept it here quickly and get it through the publication.

11:03.266 --> 11:03.727
That's good, sir.

11:03.947 --> 11:06.749
Now, did you tell us the name of the author?

11:06.849 --> 11:07.690
Richard Peterson.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.331
Richard Peterson.

11:08.351 --> 11:09.352
That's something you want to check.

11:10.072 --> 11:13.035
Either in the minutes, the editorial... Find out what you can do about that.

11:13.055 --> 11:17.139
See, this is something we can find either in correspondence or in the editorial... Maybe.

11:17.739 --> 11:20.862
Well, maybe, but it's the kind of thing... Check me out.

11:20.882 --> 11:21.283
Okay.

11:21.303 --> 11:21.863
Well, it works.

11:21.983 --> 11:23.725
Because maybe...

11:24.278 --> 11:26.663
That's how I remember the sequence going.

11:26.683 --> 11:29.187
There may be something really cute in it.

11:29.608 --> 11:33.756
But there was something very fortuitous about it.

11:34.337 --> 11:40.048
This is the kind of thing we have a wonderful lead from Mr. Pollard, but now we have to follow this kind of thing.

11:40.108 --> 11:42.933
You have to check me out.

11:42.954 --> 11:43.755
And I could be...

11:43.735 --> 11:48.440
And if you find it, that was our job to document it.

11:48.881 --> 11:50.763
If I'm quite wrong, I'd look to find it.

11:50.783 --> 11:52.605
I think I might be somewhat well.

11:52.665 --> 11:53.506
I love it.

11:53.586 --> 11:59.033
It's one of these stories where something is going to fall into the tracks.

11:59.433 --> 12:01.015
And now you've explored it.

12:01.676 --> 12:05.761
But she was just superb.

12:06.782 --> 12:08.964
So there must be files on Helen Graham.

12:09.024 --> 12:09.245
Yes.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.088
You might even talk to her.

12:12.355 --> 12:13.176
She's still around?

12:13.396 --> 12:14.877
Okay.

12:15.077 --> 12:16.419
Is she here?

12:16.479 --> 12:23.525
She lives out in a retirement center called the Whitney Center.

12:23.545 --> 12:25.907
See, I was almost assuming that she was no longer with us.

12:25.927 --> 12:26.647
No, no.

12:26.667 --> 12:31.311
The last time I saw her, I don't know.

12:31.332 --> 12:32.753
Last year, sometime.

12:33.053 --> 12:33.593
That's great.

12:33.694 --> 12:36.276
I think she is.

12:36.356 --> 12:41.060
But I have nothing but the highest praise for John Coker.

12:41.180 --> 12:42.261
Well, we'll talk to him.

12:42.494 --> 12:44.538
This is going to be a fun little book.

12:44.678 --> 12:51.631
I see stories like this.

12:51.711 --> 13:00.487
I fully believe that a lot of what had been good trade publishing may now have to be done by a non-profit.

13:00.507 --> 13:05.717
You see, trade publishers used to be able to be their profit.

13:07.418 --> 13:23.645
But since they've all been taken over by German conformers, and since the people in the business are bean counters and not editors... You know who used to go into publishing in my generation?

13:23.685 --> 13:34.202
And I would say, in subsequent ones, up until, I would say, well, anyway, through the mid-'80s.

13:35.431 --> 13:45.330
People in college, even in graduate school, who loved literature, who didn't find anything.

13:45.390 --> 13:55.870
They weren't so much committed to teaching, the idea of teaching that they were willing to put up with.

13:56.457 --> 14:05.773
the academic line could be better or worse depending on where you were and what you were doing.

14:06.114 --> 14:18.094
And I thought one of the other good ways to spend time with literature and be able to make a living dealing with writing and reading

14:19.745 --> 14:24.630
Terrible manuscripts you knew you were going to reject before you went through more than ten pages.

14:24.650 --> 14:28.734
It was no worse than reading bad freshman papers.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.839
And so they would then start out.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.701
My older daughter.

14:36.382 --> 14:39.224
She graduated from Yale.

14:39.705 --> 14:48.233
And then she went to New York and had that, the job, I used to call it the job of a girl with postcards.

14:48.253 --> 14:48.874
That is,

14:49.175 --> 14:53.565
She'd be an assistant to an editor.

14:55.429 --> 14:58.375
She'd have the cubicle outside the editor's office.

14:58.776 --> 15:07.656
Wherever they were, wherever they were at, and I had to deal with them, they would always have picture postcards from friends all around the world.

15:08.311 --> 15:12.275
And they would be trainees, and then they would move up and become editors themselves.

15:13.116 --> 15:36.478
One of them had been a student of mine at City University, and had done a very good dissertation, not with me, but with Irving Hound, a colleague, and then couldn't get the job, just signed on to be that girl at Random Books, who's now a very distinguished

15:37.150 --> 15:40.515
You know, reprint editor, you know.

15:41.657 --> 15:45.102
But those things happen all the time.

15:45.202 --> 15:57.861
Some of the people, the editors, the acquisitions editors, were also capable of doing line editing and copy because they were literate.

15:57.881 --> 15:58.723
I like that picture.

15:58.863 --> 16:00.445
Oh, that's taking that again.

16:00.485 --> 16:02.989
My hair a mess.

16:03.273 --> 16:10.021
Okay, do I look at you?

16:10.081 --> 16:21.233
I don't want to pose, and I look awful when I pose.

16:21.253 --> 16:31.845
So you can't make marginal profit, because otherwise you'll be cut away.

16:32.112 --> 16:39.405
But a university press can make marginal profit or simply cover costs and it's doing what it's supposed to be.

16:40.006 --> 16:48.201
And so books that sell for a book, I don't care what it is, a book that can sell 4,000 copies.

16:48.481 --> 16:50.445
That's a big sale for university press.

16:50.465 --> 16:53.530
And hard copies, a big sale for university press.

16:54.235 --> 16:59.002
I'd never get a book published from the trade house.

16:59.082 --> 17:13.544
Well, you see, I'm grateful that some publicists like... Well, for poetry, there's a whole different... But they almost do that as a... They do that as their gesture.

17:13.664 --> 17:16.108
I mean, they don't expect it anymore.

17:16.679 --> 17:23.687
I mean, I think that, I was just delighted that you told me that your person made a profit.

17:23.707 --> 17:24.708
That's amazing.

17:24.728 --> 17:25.849
And are they going to do it again?

17:25.909 --> 17:28.151
Well, they say, makes a profit.

17:28.171 --> 17:30.053
That is, it was blacking on his books.

17:30.073 --> 17:31.515
It can't be profit-making.

17:31.555 --> 17:32.116
That's right.

17:32.136 --> 17:33.117
It's in the black.

17:33.137 --> 17:34.158
It's in the black, yes.

17:34.198 --> 17:36.460
Whatever that means.

17:36.480 --> 17:39.604
It means it can afford to do.

17:41.205 --> 17:43.988
It means they can afford to do wonderful things.

17:44.168 --> 17:45.450
Yes.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.551
That's the point they make.

17:46.835 --> 17:52.821
But then they also have to ask themselves when they do books like the Piper Papers that only sell 8 or 9 hundred copies.

17:53.742 --> 17:59.208
But that's what being in the black is for, to be able to do those things.

17:59.228 --> 18:06.315
That is, black subsidizes rather rare, so it levels up.

18:08.137 --> 18:12.522
That's the way trade publishing used to be, when the margins could be now.

18:14.189 --> 18:17.155
Do you mind if I get back in touch with you at some future point?

18:17.175 --> 18:18.618
Oh, absolutely not.

18:18.738 --> 18:22.045
I mean, there are all sorts of things probably since I was burbling at you.

18:22.526 --> 18:28.197
What I would like to do is because I've just started actually this project basically this week.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.462
Oh, I see.

18:32.305 --> 18:33.227
Why don't you...

18:33.443 --> 18:36.567
Don't hesitate, folks.

18:36.707 --> 18:38.569
I didn't know that.

18:39.050 --> 18:41.172
Did it seem like I'm knowledgeable?

18:41.232 --> 18:42.774
Yeah, I thought I was.

18:42.794 --> 18:44.055
I'm not knowledgeable yet at all.

18:44.196 --> 18:47.179
I will be knowledgeable.

18:47.199 --> 18:48.701
A hundred times more than I know.

18:48.941 --> 18:51.624
Already I think we're developing some strategies for research here.

18:51.644 --> 18:56.650
Are you speaking to anybody who is or has been on the board?

18:57.254 --> 19:00.898
There's one person I really want to talk to.

19:00.918 --> 19:01.138
Okay.

19:01.759 --> 19:19.737
He's a dear friend, colleague of mine, one of the most interesting and distinguished professors of literature in the country I can think of, somebody with great practical, political knowledge, named David Marmich.

19:20.558 --> 19:25.843
Yale has published some superb books of his.

19:27.663 --> 19:30.987
And he has been on the board.

19:31.027 --> 19:32.528
I don't know if he still is.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.170
But he might have some insight.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.152
I mean, the publications.

19:37.174 --> 19:39.576
Just look him up in the last.

19:39.616 --> 19:42.399
You should unquestionably speak to him about the press.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.202
And how do I get in touch with you, 203?

19:46.784 --> 19:49.487
Yeah, an email, john.hollander at yale.edu.

19:49.527 --> 19:51.990
That's the best way.

19:52.010 --> 19:54.733
And you could get in touch with him by david.bromwich.

19:55.017 --> 19:58.525
B-R-O-M-W-I-C-H at Yale.edu.

19:58.685 --> 19:59.447
I love this system.

19:59.527 --> 20:01.331
I would definitely talk to you.

20:01.431 --> 20:02.413
It shall be done.

20:02.734 --> 20:08.406
And then when we get together, a couple months from now, I really know what I'm talking about.

20:08.526 --> 20:09.508
I think I am.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.856
I'm sorry I was so... I'm sorry I was so... No, you weren't.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.359
I was fascinated.

20:14.474 --> 20:17.300
This is my kind of interview, to be honest with you.

20:17.320 --> 20:22.713
But there are undoubtedly things I, you know, most specific things I could tell you.

20:22.813 --> 20:27.343
Well, if you don't mind, I'll ask you to please do.

20:27.363 --> 20:30.671
What I'm going to do now is, now I can check this.

20:30.691 --> 20:32.635
Now I'm going to start transcribing myself.
