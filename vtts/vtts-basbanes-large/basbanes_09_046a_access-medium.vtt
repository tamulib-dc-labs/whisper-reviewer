WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:08.727
As long as that little red light is running, it flies.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.113
We're talking with Hermione.

00:11.133 --> 00:12.597
That's how we pronounce your name.

00:12.617 --> 00:13.900
That's correct.

00:13.920 --> 00:19.153
And let's start with a few easy questions.

00:20.855 --> 00:27.208
wouldn't you say that it's kind of intimidating to do a book on Wolfe where there's such a shelf of other books?

00:27.228 --> 00:36.867
Well, I did start by saying that a lot of people have their idea referred from the title of Edward Albee's play and that I was rather afraid of Virginia.

00:36.968 --> 00:40.635
It was a daunting prospect and I must admit quite frankly that I was

00:41.138 --> 00:42.239
I was asked to do it.

00:42.420 --> 00:43.981
I don't think I would have... Really?

00:44.001 --> 00:45.303
Yeah, I was asked by one publisher.

00:45.343 --> 00:46.785
I said, no, it's a ridiculous idea.

00:46.805 --> 00:48.267
There's too much on Virginians already.

00:48.327 --> 00:50.429
And then someone else asked me about three months later.

00:50.449 --> 00:55.295
I thought, well, maybe this is the time and maybe I am the person to do it.

00:55.335 --> 00:56.917
But I started in great trepidation.

00:56.937 --> 01:02.464
It was like a... I guess it was like an arranged marriage where you then fall in love.

01:02.804 --> 01:04.506
But you had already done critical studies.

01:04.526 --> 01:05.448
I'd done work on her.

01:05.468 --> 01:08.571
I'd been reading her all my life, really, and I'd written a book on the novels.

01:08.591 --> 01:09.913
It was the first book I wrote...

01:10.349 --> 01:13.854
which came out in 1977, just a little introduction, really, to the novel.

01:13.914 --> 01:17.700
So I didn't want to do that kind of literary criticism again.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.668
And since I've been reading her, since that book, in the last 20 years, I think she's changed a lot.

01:22.708 --> 01:28.056
A lot of posthumous publications have taken place, which have changed our sense of her, you know.

01:28.437 --> 01:34.145
Well, all the letters, all the diaries, a lot of the essays are now, a lot of the manuscripts are now available.

01:34.526 --> 01:38.432
So I think our whole perception of her is this rather ethereal...

01:39.155 --> 01:41.118
lady authoress.

01:41.138 --> 01:48.408
So she's changed, you would think, more from the diaries and the letters than from the actual literature itself?

01:48.528 --> 01:58.682
Well, I think the posthumous, the enormous amount of posthumous publication has greatly added to and developed our sense of her from when she died and there were

01:58.966 --> 02:12.562
you know, the novels and some uncollected journalism, and I think people didn't have the sense of her as they do now, which I wanted to get across in the book, of this hugely energetic professional woman who wrote like crazy every day of her life, and she wasn't unwell.

02:12.742 --> 02:17.608
I mean, the work out for it is just, I know they had servants, but they don't go through a lot.

02:17.648 --> 02:25.918
You know, I am bemoaning that I have to do a column every week, and I love doing interviews, and I do this, this is my passion, really, I've been doing it for 20 years.

02:26.557 --> 02:28.079
And I'm writing a book and all this.

02:28.119 --> 02:34.005
And you have in here that she's doing this book, doing these short stories, doing 37 works of criticism.

02:34.045 --> 02:36.308
That's pretty close to my... I know.

02:36.408 --> 02:38.230
And then do you write 10 letters a day?

02:38.250 --> 02:40.433
And then I don't write any letters at all.

02:40.453 --> 02:43.476
I email, which I love because I can do it in two sentences.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.517
I'm sure she would have liked email.

02:44.737 --> 02:49.803
But it's not just the amount of the work and it's not just the fact that she'd been a lot written about.

02:49.823 --> 02:54.268
It's also that she was a daunting prospect in other ways, too, I think.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.440
Because for some people she's a heroine and for other people she's anathema.

03:01.064 --> 03:06.471
She certainly has achieved... I mean, she's an icon here.

03:07.293 --> 03:09.316
How is she perceived in the UK?

03:10.357 --> 03:14.383
I'm just beginning to see this this week being on tour here.

03:15.384 --> 03:18.228
She's more adulated here, I think.

03:18.248 --> 03:21.753
She's also more appropriated here, it seems to me.

03:21.834 --> 03:22.855
I mean, there are very...

03:23.442 --> 03:26.846
appropriative versions of her here.

03:27.047 --> 03:32.333
Because as part of an agenda, I mean, I don't think you have the culture-wise in England.

03:33.255 --> 03:39.042
Well, I think there is, I mean, I think there are two things.

03:39.122 --> 03:40.083
No, it's interesting.

03:40.103 --> 03:40.864
There are two things here.

03:40.944 --> 03:46.091
One is that I think the class reading of Virginia Woolf is much more critical in England than it is here.

03:46.111 --> 03:50.817
There's a much more pronounced middle-class resentment of her

03:51.185 --> 03:56.031
snobbery, which is there, and of her sort of upper-classness and of her privilegedness.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.675
You hear a lot more about that in my country than you do here.

03:59.775 --> 04:12.690
Here, I think she has been much more taken up by different branches of feminism and made to serve as she can for different kinds of visions of women's lives.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.652
It's a very different kind of reading.

04:14.832 --> 04:18.897
And I think what is important from my standpoint is that

04:19.265 --> 04:22.873
She is taken up because the work does endure.

04:22.993 --> 04:24.255
Yeah, the work.

04:24.356 --> 04:24.837
Oh, sure.

04:24.857 --> 04:33.876
I mean, because we do see any number, and this is not any particular faction, but you'll be so quick to put forward a candidate.

04:35.499 --> 04:36.902
And then when you look at the work, it's,

04:37.777 --> 04:38.578
It's not going to hold up.

04:38.658 --> 04:39.559
Who are you thinking of?

04:42.183 --> 04:42.844
I know what you mean.

04:43.285 --> 04:44.666
But you know what I mean?

04:44.687 --> 04:47.190
People who fulfill a certain agenda.

04:47.270 --> 04:47.550
Right.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.454
Because there are too many agendas going on here in this country.

04:50.474 --> 04:51.676
But she's like Shakespeare.

04:51.856 --> 04:56.723
You can use her for any vantage point.

04:56.743 --> 05:00.769
If you want to be critical of her, that's my God, there's the ammunition.

05:01.269 --> 05:03.773
If you want to turn her into a victim, there's the ammunition.

05:03.813 --> 05:06.597
If you want her to be a saint, there's the ammunition.

05:06.777 --> 05:07.598
She's...

05:08.067 --> 05:11.931
very exploitable, I think, actually in the best sense.

05:11.951 --> 05:15.575
For instance, Sarah Orange Joy is now really emerging.

05:15.595 --> 05:15.936
Oh, is she?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.758
She has been beatified.

05:17.778 --> 05:19.740
She's just one step below sing to it, I think.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.662
No one's ever heard of her in England, do you see?

05:21.682 --> 05:24.185
Well, you see, but she's correct.

05:25.186 --> 05:26.307
And her work is fine.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.909
Actually, it's good.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.450
And her work is fine.

05:29.610 --> 05:33.855
And I'm delighted that she's being...

05:34.122 --> 05:41.892
resuscitated, but I wonder if it's because of the literature as well, all these things are, you know, high literature.

05:41.912 --> 05:47.880
But Wolfe is really wonderful because she does, she has the legs, as I say.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.001
I mean, they're there.

05:49.021 --> 05:52.446
I mean, the work does, it does.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.851
Now, let me just switch thoughts here.

05:56.871 --> 06:00.636
Do you think that with so much biographical work, so much critical work,

06:01.173 --> 06:07.386
that like Shakespeare and Dante and Cervantes, that every generation, do you think she's in that category?

06:07.486 --> 06:10.954
Where every generation requires herself?

06:11.295 --> 06:14.582
She has a line which was very encouraging to me while I was doing this book.

06:14.682 --> 06:16.205
In fact, it's about Shelley.

06:16.987 --> 06:21.797
She says, there are some stories that have to be retold by each generation.

06:22.267 --> 06:25.091
And I think that is very appropriate for her.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.174
She's there, but you think she is in that way.

06:27.194 --> 06:33.283
Well, I think she changes, just as I was suggesting the posthumous publishing history has rather changed our view of her.

06:33.343 --> 06:40.893
I think she changes as we go on into the later part of this, as we come to the end of this century.

06:40.953 --> 06:42.516
I think she can be rewritten.

06:42.976 --> 06:45.500
I'm sure there will be more versions of Virginia Woolf to come.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.344
People go on wanting to make sense of her in different ways.

06:48.724 --> 06:50.687
And I think now it's partly to do with

06:50.988 --> 07:02.022
the way these great early 20th century modernist figures like Proust and Joyce and, you know, Thomas Mann and, you know, Faulkner, I mean, they're sort of, the dust is clearing.

07:02.102 --> 07:07.309
I think we're beginning to see them, you know, sort of afresh and be able to see them whole, you know.

07:07.369 --> 07:11.054
So I think that's important.

07:12.976 --> 07:14.879
I've just forgotten what I was going to say then.

07:15.079 --> 07:19.965
I'll just come back to that idea, yeah, about how we've,

07:20.131 --> 07:25.098
The question of whether each generation should have its own reading.

07:25.118 --> 07:25.578
Yes.

07:27.141 --> 07:43.523
Yes, that's the other thing, is that like Sylvia Plath, she's one of these writers who keep, oddly, the readings of her keep pace with attitudes to psychoanalysis or to suicide or to mental illness or to family life.

07:43.823 --> 07:52.574
So she's actually been, as it were, re-read through various fashions, if you want to call it that, or phases of psychoanalytical theory.

07:52.594 --> 07:54.917
So that in the late 60s, 80s, 70s, you know, when R.D.

07:54.937 --> 08:06.292
Lang was a big deal, and there was a lot of reading of her to say, no, she wasn't mad, she was truly sane, and the family is responsible for the oppressive regime that she had.

08:06.632 --> 08:10.557
And then in the late 80s, early 90s, you had, as it were, Virginia Woolf as a victim of

08:10.925 --> 08:21.098
childhood sexual abuse, and there is some truth in that, but it became the whole story, you know, and I'm sure there's someone writing a book now on Virginia Woolf and multiple personality disorder, you know.

08:21.359 --> 08:29.389
So how did you, I love the structure of this too, I mean, as you point out, and it was wonderful that you started with a chapter called Biography.

08:29.489 --> 08:29.810
Yeah.

08:30.531 --> 08:34.176
Because you do make clear how you're going to do this.

08:34.196 --> 08:34.536
Yes.

08:34.718 --> 08:38.244
And you say, I can't start by saying, look what you do.

08:38.324 --> 08:41.088
She was born.

08:43.031 --> 08:48.219
But how did you come to the structure that, because it is a very interesting structure.

08:48.239 --> 08:53.107
Well, I didn't, she herself is so skeptical about biography.

08:53.187 --> 08:57.013
She's so critical of the biography she knew in her time.

08:57.550 --> 08:59.773
Yeah, she read it all the time.

08:59.813 --> 09:01.014
She tried to write it.

09:01.255 --> 09:02.536
It was her favorite reading.

09:02.597 --> 09:07.343
She often is writing a kind of version of biography when she's writing fiction, I think.

09:07.363 --> 09:09.065
I mean, look at Orlando.

09:09.365 --> 09:15.773
But she's very critical of the way that biography reduces or simplifies or falsifies the subject's life.

09:15.854 --> 09:22.622
And so that was one reason for not just writing a naively straightforward chronological, you know, for her it seemed quite wrong.

09:23.223 --> 09:27.068
But I also, when I began, I actually wanted to totally get rid of chronology.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.443
and not have a storyline and just have these themes.

09:30.463 --> 09:32.545
And I started like that and it didn't work.

09:32.565 --> 09:34.307
I mean, you do need to tell the story.

09:34.788 --> 09:37.410
You've got to have the narrative.

09:37.430 --> 09:40.934
You've got to keep the reader on that tapeworm of storyline.

09:40.954 --> 09:49.843
So what I decided to do was in a way sort of alternate or pause and every so often collect together certain ideas.

09:49.883 --> 09:54.287
Rather, as she says about her characters in Mrs. Dalloway, that she likes to

09:54.605 --> 09:58.771
hollow out big caves underneath her character so they go back in time.

09:58.831 --> 10:04.159
She's so interested in memory too, and the past and the present always crossing in her mind.

10:04.199 --> 10:05.120
So it was partly to do that.

10:05.681 --> 10:22.806
And I know we don't live our life by themes, but I thought to thematise something like reading or money or fame or her attitude to various people like Taffyn Ransfield helped, you know, because often in biography you get a whole lot of facts

10:24.085 --> 10:28.932
one after the other endlessly, and it's sometimes hard to make a shape out of it.

10:29.352 --> 10:35.000
There's a very interesting book just published within the past two weeks called The Hidden Writer.

10:35.741 --> 10:36.883
I don't know the... It's about diaries.

10:37.364 --> 10:38.045
Oh, well, I'm assuming.

10:38.065 --> 10:42.130
The diaries of the writer's Alexandra Johnson, who lives around here, teaches at Harvard.

10:42.210 --> 10:43.712
Terrific book.

10:44.173 --> 10:46.677
Can I have a question?

10:46.697 --> 10:52.725
She takes seven female diarists, and two, of course, are Mansfield and Wolfe,

10:53.009 --> 10:54.091
which are perfect.

10:54.451 --> 10:55.292
Perfect.

10:55.313 --> 10:55.953
Perfect.

10:56.534 --> 10:59.759
And she starts it with Marjorie Fleming.

11:00.581 --> 11:09.134
The diarists who started keeping diaries at certain points in their lives of what Fleming has made as a child.

11:09.594 --> 11:11.798
Then you have Sonia Tolstoy.

11:11.818 --> 11:21.953
Of course, a diary is a trap in a way for a biographer because you believe that when someone is writing their diary that they're telling it like it is.

11:22.372 --> 11:26.977
And so the Great Temptation with a great... You know, right.

11:27.037 --> 11:27.297
Exactly.

11:27.357 --> 11:32.783
With these compulsive lies like Catherine Anne Porter, you know.

11:32.803 --> 11:37.848
But with such a great diarist as this, you know, you have to be very careful, I think.

11:37.908 --> 11:42.133
Of course, she's massively in here in her own voice, and I wanted that, you know.

11:42.553 --> 11:43.374
But you've got to be careful.

11:43.394 --> 11:48.379
There are some things she doesn't talk about much in the diary, and there are things in the diary which are not

11:48.629 --> 11:49.871
quite sure you can trust.

11:50.051 --> 11:52.536
What's your feeling on the diaries today?

11:52.556 --> 11:58.306
Do you think she did not want them, do you think she wanted all of her papers destroyed?

11:58.326 --> 12:09.625
I think she was in such terrible distress and sense of loss of self-valuation at that point when she wrote that note, please destroy my papers, that I think that's not something she would have

12:10.128 --> 12:26.314
actually um in some moods really wanted it was quite clear in the last couple of years of her life that she was processing the diaries and turning them into an autobiography which she would i think have gone on writing and it would have been a very extraordinary

12:26.615 --> 12:52.572
book um and the first you know when their house is bombed they go to london the whole place is a wreck what's the first thing she does she collects stories i love that that will probably make its way into my new book one way or another saving the diary yeah that's what's important let's before we i like these conversations that go off in a hundred directions but the reading is really very important to me

12:53.041 --> 12:57.548
You did say that she is the perfect example of something disformed by their reading.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.690
Maybe you could just talk a bit about it.

12:59.191 --> 13:02.316
Well, she didn't go to school, and she didn't go to university.

13:02.517 --> 13:07.024
Two things which she was quite, I mean, particularly university, she was very bitter about that.

13:07.505 --> 13:16.119
She had instead this extraordinary home education under her father's monitoring, but rather free tutelage, I think.

13:16.199 --> 13:17.361
She had the run of his books.

13:17.797 --> 13:24.844
She started to read compulsively, avidly, widely, from the age of about five, as far as I can work out.

13:24.964 --> 13:33.051
You know, she's reading Hatfield's Voyages and Carlisle's French Revolution when she's 12 years old, as well as all the 19th century novels.

13:33.091 --> 13:36.114
She's an addict, there's no doubt about it.

13:36.134 --> 13:41.159
And she... Is she limited by the books that her father had?

13:41.179 --> 13:43.782
I think at first, I don't think it was tremendously limiting.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.365
I mean, he had a very good, you know...

13:47.564 --> 13:49.647
But that's important in her development, that isn't it?

13:49.667 --> 13:52.711
Her father's books would have to be crucial to her development.

13:52.731 --> 13:53.552
Oh, crucial, hugely.

13:53.572 --> 13:53.952
Her father's books.

13:53.972 --> 13:54.994
Yes, her father's books.

13:55.054 --> 14:00.541
And her father was a biographer who was also very interested in history and in the 18th century.

14:00.962 --> 14:03.064
And she read history books for a long time.

14:03.124 --> 14:06.869
And in fact, he thought she would be a historian.

14:06.949 --> 14:09.713
And there's a great deal of that in her work.

14:09.873 --> 14:12.036
I mean, there's a lot of histories of English.

14:12.016 --> 14:34.277
literature and english culture and civilization within her fiction the last book she was going to write was a history of reading and writing called a non she is it's she that's her whole program really and then all these essays which i have flagged for for my own citation about reading about sure no and there are these wonderful essays not just about

14:34.882 --> 14:47.625
critical essays on reading certain writers but the actual physical emotional experience of reading you know how differently you feel when you're reading she says if you're reading peeps's diaries you feel quite different than if you're reading

14:48.027 --> 15:16.279
you know montaigne or or shakespeare you know you actually become a different person you know it's a very modern post-modernist idea of reading the read the book reads you the books read us yes but it's so fascinating what did she mean by that could you just i think that's my phrase rather than i think that's my right but i think what she's constantly trying to describe there's an s there's actually an article which starts off

15:16.512 --> 15:20.889
sweetly as a lecture for school girls called How Should One Read a Book?

15:21.552 --> 15:25.527
And she says, what you must do is you must read the book as if you were the writer.

15:25.793 --> 15:27.595
You know, you must get inside.

15:27.655 --> 15:37.504
It's all that empathy and getting crawling inside the skin of the writer and trying to sort of see what he or she is up to and how they're doing it.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.306
I mean, it's a great lesson in critical reading.

15:40.547 --> 15:48.534
But she also talks a lot about how when you're reading something, it's all in bits and you're getting lots of sense impressions and lots of very strong feelings.

15:48.594 --> 15:52.778
And then when you finish the book, you have to somehow make a shape of it.

15:52.798 --> 15:54.079
And that's when you start.

15:54.498 --> 15:59.667
turning your reading notes into an essay or trying to see what the whole thing is.

15:59.727 --> 16:01.370
And she needs Babby to do that.

16:01.430 --> 16:04.835
She often says, I've got to make a shape out of this book.

16:04.875 --> 16:05.817
I can't just let it.

16:06.158 --> 16:08.962
She can't just flick it aside and turn to something else.

16:08.982 --> 16:10.064
Did she enjoy her reviews?

16:10.926 --> 16:11.747
Writing the reviews.

16:12.014 --> 16:18.724
I think early on she felt very inhibited from writing for the TLS under male editors who expected her to be her father's daughter.

16:18.785 --> 16:27.218
And there's that whole thing later on about killing the angel in that, throwing the ink pot at the angel in the house who was standing by and saying, be nice to the men, don't be offensive, don't get angry.

16:28.019 --> 16:33.307
And so when she manages to do that and write a bit more openly, I think she enjoyed it more.

16:33.387 --> 16:36.452
She distinguishes, it seems to me, between hack work,

16:37.259 --> 16:48.711
you know, review work, and essays written for her own, more for her own pleasure and at greater length, though she also did publish those as journalism, very often here and in England.

16:49.492 --> 16:55.858
I guess what I'm getting at, did she want to share her take on literary receptions with other people?

16:55.898 --> 16:58.081
Yes, and that's the whole thing.

16:58.121 --> 17:07.030
That's why she's such an important self-educated reader, because, for instance, she was passionate about public libraries, and because public libraries are under such...

17:07.769 --> 17:36.949
economic pressure in my country probably here as well yeah that's right I think of her as a great advocate of the public library as the university of what she calls the common reader which is the phrase she takes from Dr Johnson which is the person like her who is obviously an uncommon reader in many ways but the person who didn't have no university education in her case and eclectic eclectic you know picking up all sorts of things from all over the place

17:37.469 --> 17:49.523
Now I've lost my... Of course, you were asked to do this, I would imagine, on the strength of your earlier critical work.

17:49.724 --> 17:50.124
Yes.

17:51.786 --> 17:55.711
What kind of baggage do you bring to a project like this?

17:55.731 --> 17:59.796
Do you come with any kind of preconceived... Yeah.

18:00.376 --> 18:05.282
I kept being asked while I was doing it, what is your line on her?

18:06.477 --> 18:09.241
which was a question I actually found very uncomfortable.

18:09.301 --> 18:13.707
I found rather distressing, because I didn't know what the answer was.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.149
You researched to find out, too.

18:15.169 --> 18:21.598
Yes, and very often when you're researching for biography, you don't know what you're looking for.

18:21.638 --> 18:22.279
It's weird.

18:22.339 --> 18:24.682
It's as if you go through all this documentation and manage it.

18:24.702 --> 18:26.705
I think those are the best biographies where you don't know what you're looking for.

18:26.725 --> 18:32.653
Well, you have a sort of vague hunch, but actually feel you need to read the whole thing again once you've done the work.

18:33.022 --> 18:37.629
And I often felt I was going through these vast archives of manuscripts and letters and so on.

18:38.169 --> 18:42.035
And I thought, well, it's exciting, but, you know, my God, where do you stop?

18:42.055 --> 18:48.885
And I wasn't quite sure really what I was... I wanted to get... I wanted to make her real.

18:49.266 --> 18:52.971
I wanted to make her real, not just an icon, not...

18:53.255 --> 18:57.662
not someone who had been turned into a figure who represented something.

18:58.964 --> 19:02.169
I wanted to feel what it would be like to be her.

19:02.269 --> 19:09.541
I guess that was the... And I suppose if I had a take or a line, it was to do with her professionalism, actually.

19:09.922 --> 19:18.796
Her amazing commitment to her work, her very acute sense of herself as a professional writer who could earn money, which she loved to do, for her work.

19:18.916 --> 19:20.038
Not as this sort of...

19:20.795 --> 19:24.841
crazed victim, you know.

19:25.361 --> 19:26.683
She was Virginia Woolf, too.

19:27.845 --> 19:31.169
I mean, Virginia Woolf, not Victor Woolf or something like that.

19:31.189 --> 19:32.191
You know what I'm saying?

19:32.331 --> 19:34.394
She didn't hide her sexuality.

19:34.894 --> 19:40.542
No, she was always very aware of herself as a woman writer in a preponderantly male market, actually.

19:40.792 --> 19:45.517
I mean, you have so many women who have written through history, and it's challenged.

19:45.537 --> 19:47.999
It's not possible for a woman to have written.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.082
I mean, she actually had to prove her credentials.

19:50.162 --> 19:55.827
I'm not talking about Wolfe in particular, but... Well, and she also had to work against expectations.

19:55.908 --> 19:58.310
You know, what kind of writer was she supposed to be?

19:58.350 --> 20:01.213
She was supposed to be Leslie Stephen's daughter.

20:02.054 --> 20:04.637
And actually, she completely subverts that.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.980
Well, somebody asked her to write his biography.

20:08.213 --> 20:32.567
um and she wrote she writes she writes a letter i can't remember something someone's just written said would i write leslie stephen's biography good grief so what would you say were the greatest were there surprises i guess you mentioned the professionalism but i don't know if that was a surprise maybe you're just more impressed by it but were there any did she surprise you

20:33.037 --> 21:00.327
I think her courage, yes, I think I knew, I sort of knew I admired her before I started, but I didn't realise how much I admired her, and I think her extraordinary valour and stoicism and courage just always knocked me back, and also, I know this sounds crass, but she's very intelligent, you know, I mean, if you say, what is the first adjective you would use for Virginia Woolf, it would probably be

21:00.762 --> 21:07.170
sensitive or imaginative or creative or inspired, but she's powerfully intelligent.

21:07.891 --> 21:14.499
And I think the essays, you know, even if she'd never written any novels, would still make her a big figure.

21:15.179 --> 21:15.960
Yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.444
You mentioned that you would almost be frightened, not frightened, but anxious.

21:20.586 --> 21:29.597
Well, I mean, she didn't like, she didn't like, well, even if you're not a fool, she didn't like middle-class girls.

21:29.677 --> 21:30.718
She didn't like

21:31.053 --> 21:53.162
rivals she didn't like i would think of myself as younger than her i guess you do if you're the biographer you know it's strange that their age passes your age you know you get a different relationship um but i you know she i don't think she would have liked me very much winifred holtby no it wouldn't no no no i'm too well because she didn't she didn't like

21:54.593 --> 21:57.678
She was very critical of the middle classes, which I am.

21:58.198 --> 22:04.167
And she was very leery of, you know, bright, younger women.

22:04.247 --> 22:06.490
She was not always... Yeah, she's jealous.

22:06.531 --> 22:08.233
She's rivalrous, you know.

22:08.293 --> 22:09.335
She's competitive.

22:09.455 --> 22:12.720
Which is wonderful, but the Mansfield... Yes.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.102
Well, diary, which does kind of come out.

22:14.122 --> 22:16.205
The letters between them, yes.

22:16.405 --> 22:20.812
You see, when... Okay, thank you.

22:20.832 --> 22:21.833
When...

22:22.572 --> 22:30.879
Winifred Holtby, before she had become well-known for South Riding, wrote the first English biography of Virginia Woolf in 1932.

22:31.119 --> 22:32.741
I discovered this hadn't been used before.

22:32.761 --> 22:36.504
There's a wonderful archive of correspondence between them and the whole public library.

22:37.224 --> 22:47.333
And Virginia Woolf is very polite to her and very rude about her and says, you know, she's a Yorkshire farmer's daughter who learned to read by minding the pigs.

22:48.474 --> 22:51.236
And when she finally gets the book, it's not clear whether she's actually read it.

22:51.336 --> 22:52.157
And she says...

22:52.357 --> 22:58.242
You gave me so many ideas about Virginia Woolf that I would really like to write a book about her myself.

22:58.262 --> 22:59.804
You know, she's a tremendous put-down.

23:00.304 --> 23:04.508
And so, you know, with someone like that, she was very on edge.

23:04.908 --> 23:07.410
How are we doing?

23:07.651 --> 23:12.995
The book, of course, speaks for itself.

23:15.357 --> 23:18.180
You don't mind if I don't question you specifically about the book?

23:18.200 --> 23:18.981
No, no, no.

23:19.001 --> 23:20.642
That's my job.

23:21.095 --> 23:45.027
uh what's your attitude on this uh and i i think that you refrain from this which is good and then this trend that we have this psych psychobiography she would be a sitting deck with a psychoanalyst kind of a biological thing well she has been um and and there's a lot to be learned from that i mean i don't think one can

23:45.310 --> 23:47.713
So I'm not having any of that at all, no.

23:47.813 --> 23:49.836
And there are very good psychobiographies.

23:49.936 --> 23:51.898
And she has brought Freudian too, which is important too.

23:52.119 --> 23:59.628
Well, I think Adele's biography of James, which is your classic psychobiography, is actually a very revealing book in many ways.

23:59.688 --> 24:08.820
And there's no doubt that Virginia Woolf had a deeply traumatised childhood and that you can, I think, account for a lot of what she writes about and how she writes and how she behaves.

24:09.020 --> 24:12.583
through that childhood, but I don't want to infantilize her, you know?

24:12.944 --> 24:23.093
Seems to me there's something about psychobiography that infantilizes the writer, that keeps them in the nursery, that means that they can, it's a determinist view, really, isn't it?

24:23.113 --> 24:35.905
So Freud, I mean, Freud is a very determinist writer, and she hated that when she finally gave in and started reading Freud in 1939, incredibly late, given how much she was around her, and they published him, and

24:36.256 --> 24:42.704
He was in the air, and when she started reading him in the war, she was deeply disturbed.

24:42.724 --> 24:44.506
She really hated him, actually.

24:45.207 --> 24:46.989
I didn't know that they'd met him.

24:47.009 --> 24:50.133
Yeah, isn't that wonderful, the story of him giving her a Narcissus?

24:50.233 --> 24:52.616
I think that's so funny.

24:52.636 --> 24:53.477
He was very ill.

24:53.517 --> 24:54.218
He was very old.

24:54.258 --> 25:05.031
He'd just been got out of Vienna, and they went to tea in Hampstead, and they had this extraordinary conversation about whether England and the Alliance

25:05.011 --> 25:10.356
powers after the First World War had somehow been to blame for the rise of Hitler.

25:10.797 --> 25:12.318
And Freud said, no, not at all.

25:12.398 --> 25:14.601
It's as if he's giving a sort of absolution.

25:14.621 --> 25:14.781
Yeah.

25:14.801 --> 25:16.282
Well, tell us one of these meetings.

25:16.322 --> 25:21.167
Remember where Anthony Burgess wrote he had Cervantes and Shakespeare meetings?

25:21.187 --> 25:21.287
Yes.

25:21.307 --> 25:21.387
Yes.

25:21.447 --> 25:22.068
I love that.

25:22.108 --> 25:27.454
They're both, apparently, who died on the same day, and they were temporaries.

25:27.474 --> 25:27.974
That's right.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.135
And it's just to imagine.

25:29.155 --> 25:29.295
I know.

25:29.576 --> 25:32.959
Well, it's like Joyce and Wolfe living exactly the same dates.

25:33.412 --> 25:35.976
And she's moved by his death when she hears about him.

25:35.997 --> 25:39.342
Or Joyce Wolf and Lawrence.

25:39.683 --> 25:42.388
She's very interested in Lawrence, actually.

25:42.708 --> 25:43.490
She never met him.

25:43.730 --> 25:45.533
She was once on a train in Italy.

25:45.573 --> 25:51.043
She looked out of the station window, Rapallo, and there was Lawrence sitting on the station platform.

25:51.163 --> 25:55.150
I know, it's wonderful.

25:56.142 --> 26:17.982
point out you know her reading wasn't always it hasn't helped how she has misread Joyce in particular I mean and you would definitely call that a misreading yes I think she's always been blamed terribly for that and in my country and in Ireland you know there's a great sort of battle of the modernists I remember when they both came out of copyright the first time before they changed the European copyright laws

26:18.215 --> 26:22.982
in 91, there was a sort of standoff between Joyce and Wolfe.

26:23.042 --> 26:23.683
It was bizarre.

26:23.703 --> 26:27.528
I kept going on the radio to say, no, it is possible actually to like Joyce and Wolfe.

26:27.789 --> 26:29.651
You know, it doesn't have to be either or.

26:29.972 --> 26:39.345
You know, so there was this idea of modernism as sort of male and macho and epic on the one hand and sort of delicate and ladylike and luminous on the other.

26:39.764 --> 26:44.855
And so people say, oh, Virginia Woolf is such a snob about joy.

26:44.915 --> 26:51.951
She says he's like a schoolboy scratching his pimples and rolling in his arms because it's really bad.

26:52.842 --> 26:54.725
It had nothing to do with Joyce.

26:54.745 --> 26:56.127
It had nothing to do with Walter.

26:56.328 --> 26:58.792
It was just one of those great put-downs, you know.

26:58.812 --> 27:02.418
Yeah, well, she was stupid about him, but at the same time, she tries harder.

27:02.478 --> 27:10.751
In the Burg, I think it is, or in Sussex, there's a whole page, several pages, manuscript notes, when she starts reading Ulysses.

27:11.212 --> 27:11.893
Very interesting.

27:12.013 --> 27:13.476
She's really trying to work out.

27:13.536 --> 27:14.918
She read that very girly, which is very interesting.

27:14.898 --> 27:18.663
She read it when it came out in serialization in 1918.

27:18.784 --> 27:22.068
You say 1819 when those entries were made.

27:22.128 --> 27:24.952
The Paris edition was 1922, so she was reading it.

27:25.553 --> 27:27.696
I think she did what she did with Proust, actually.

27:27.716 --> 27:28.197
It's interesting.

27:28.237 --> 27:32.083
She had a go, and then she stopped, and then she started again.

27:32.203 --> 27:33.885
She quite often does that in her reading.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.930
But she certainly read him very early.

27:36.950 --> 27:37.210
Yeah.

27:37.966 --> 27:43.972
And she was very influenced by Eliot, who she had just got to know, who kept saying to her, this is the great book of the century.

27:44.353 --> 27:45.478
And she would go home and say,

27:45.847 --> 28:10.065
great tom says this is the great because actually why don't i get it it's not like emily dickinson confessing in her letters how scandalized she would be about whitman if you read it i mean i never read him but i heard he was what is it whatever it is it's quite entirely disgusting yeah she's reading him yeah she's reading him and at the same time she's reading mansworth she's reading richardson she's reading may sinclair

28:10.045 --> 28:16.877
It's a whole... That's the point in the late 1910s, early 20s, when she's trying to work out, what does she want fiction to do now?

28:16.957 --> 28:18.200
What does she think it should be doing?

28:18.360 --> 28:24.591
We talk about, we use the word baggage, but what kind of baggage do you think she brought to Joyce?

28:24.611 --> 28:25.372
What did she bring to Joyce?

28:25.392 --> 28:28.217
Well, it's a class... Again, it's a class thing.

28:28.237 --> 28:30.822
It's a class thing, and also she's...

28:31.426 --> 28:33.970
Issues of censorship are problematic for her.

28:34.010 --> 28:38.116
She resents censorship, but she's also quite squeamish, I think.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.760
She's quite prim in some way.

28:40.780 --> 28:51.556
In her letters, there's an amazing letter about shitting to Duncan Grant, where she compares trying to end a letter with trying to end a visit to the lavatory.

28:51.576 --> 28:53.299
It's a breathtaking letter, actually.

28:53.802 --> 28:54.964
There's always a little bit more.

28:56.546 --> 28:59.471
But in fiction, published fiction, she can't take it.

28:59.712 --> 29:03.197
So when Bloom goes to the lavatory... She's analised.

29:04.099 --> 29:09.227
And she thinks he's doing it to show off.

29:11.411 --> 29:12.152
That's the trouble.

29:12.172 --> 29:13.534
And she thinks it's all about him.

29:13.694 --> 29:16.519
She reads Ulysses, I think, wrongly.

29:16.837 --> 29:23.184
as a very egocentric and... It is interesting that their dates are precisely the same.

29:23.565 --> 29:28.570
Had she read him with perspective, do you think, with distance, do you think it would have been a different reading?

29:28.590 --> 29:29.932
It's funny, she doesn't go back to him.

29:29.952 --> 29:43.367
It's interesting that you say, I never thought of that, actually, but when she hears of his death a few months before hers, in 1941, this very touching moment in the diary, she says, yes, Joyce is dead, whom I never met, and I remember...

29:43.516 --> 29:52.472
Catherine Mansfield coming to the house and starting to, we were laughing about him and mocking him and then she started reading and she suddenly stopped and said, something in this.

29:53.073 --> 30:03.432
And she says, I suppose this must be a scene that would take its place in the history of English history, which of course it has, you know, but she has not gone back and reread him since.

30:05.234 --> 30:05.995
Excuse me.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.337
It's all right.

30:07.377 --> 30:08.658
You're thinking about your book.

30:09.019 --> 30:12.743
I am.

30:12.803 --> 30:25.379
What I really love about this book, and I will make it so clear in my piece, is that the work is never... We never stray too far away from the work, writing.

30:25.399 --> 30:25.840
Her work.

30:26.020 --> 30:26.421
Her work.

30:27.041 --> 30:30.786
And you might explain to me how...

30:30.952 --> 30:33.455
important that was for you in the writing of this life.

30:33.996 --> 30:40.685
And I guess that would be a comment on your view of the biographer's mission as well, the literary biographer's mission.

30:41.386 --> 30:45.632
I had done a book on the work, as I said, so I didn't want to just replicate that.

30:45.792 --> 30:48.095
I didn't want to write this time.

30:48.155 --> 30:58.309
I had written a biography of Willa Cava, where I was really most interested in the work, partly because in England people don't read her very much, and I wanted to introduce the work really there.

30:58.542 --> 31:02.990
So that was a book where I stopped to talk at length, chapter by chapter, about the novels.

31:03.310 --> 31:06.776
But I didn't want to do that here, because there's so much already on the novels.

31:06.796 --> 31:09.060
There were 200 books on the novels of Virginia Woolf.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.863
And there'll be another 200, wouldn't there?

31:10.883 --> 31:13.147
Sure, within a week.

31:13.187 --> 31:15.070
That might have to Shakespeare has been approaching.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.112
Yes, there's hundreds.

31:16.092 --> 31:27.056
But what I wanted, so I only stopped once in this book and talk about a book separately in a little chapter in the middle, which is the chapter onto the lighthouse, which is to me her greatest book.

31:27.116 --> 31:29.140
And I think all the themes of family

31:29.373 --> 31:32.477
cohere in that book and all the things she's trying to do.

31:32.497 --> 31:35.761
The New York Times book review, did you see that?

31:36.081 --> 31:38.144
Virginia was scuttling to her lighthouse.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.827
That's right, but even the illustration of it is cleverly in the White House.

31:40.847 --> 31:43.510
Yes, shine on Virginia.

31:43.530 --> 31:44.231
That was great.

31:44.331 --> 31:46.474
I was very pleased.

31:46.754 --> 31:47.835
So I only did that once.

31:47.875 --> 31:55.785
The rest of the time, what I wanted to do was not so much interpret the work, but think about how... We're getting adjusted.

31:56.204 --> 32:03.936
how it was for her to write those books, what place in her life she was at when she was writing those books, what it felt like to write the books.

32:05.518 --> 32:12.709
I didn't want to do that thing saying X is Y, you know, Mrs. Dalloway is Ossaline Muller.

32:12.769 --> 32:14.132
That's reductive too.

32:14.152 --> 32:16.014
I think it's never as simple as that.

32:16.074 --> 32:19.039
People pool together, as you know, all sorts of different things.

32:19.458 --> 32:24.084
But I wanted to keep thinking, well, what did it feel like for her to be writing the years?

32:24.404 --> 32:30.032
For instance, for a book I'm terribly interested in, through the early 30s, why did it hurt so much?

32:30.152 --> 32:31.854
Why did she have such a bad time with it?

32:32.975 --> 32:34.377
So it's more that, really.

32:34.397 --> 32:39.844
It was reading, it was trying to explicate the writing of the books rather than the meaning of the books, if you see what I mean.

32:41.066 --> 32:44.470
You say in the book that the...

32:44.804 --> 32:47.188
perception of her today would even surprise her.

32:48.129 --> 32:51.394
Do you think that she would be shocked by the... I think she'd be very gratified.

32:51.414 --> 32:58.284
I think she'd also be aghast at how totally her privacy has been violated.

32:58.364 --> 33:00.207
But I think she'd see that was coming.

33:00.247 --> 33:01.990
She saw that coming in biography.

33:02.010 --> 33:03.733
She could see that was coming.

33:03.753 --> 33:10.002
But even when you point out, I mean, whatever her personal life was, I mean, it's really not that...

33:10.572 --> 33:14.198
compared to other personal lives that we... No, nothing very scandalous about it at all.

33:14.218 --> 33:15.280
Nothing scandalous about it at all.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.982
No, people would like it to be more scandalous.

33:17.023 --> 33:26.738
In fact, when this book came out in my country, no features editors were in the least bit interested in running anything about it before it came out.

33:26.758 --> 33:30.184
It had very good reviews, but before, nothing.

33:30.620 --> 33:40.452
And my people at Chateau said, they only would publish something or serialize it if you could show that she had had a secret love child by T.S.

33:40.472 --> 33:41.914
Eliot, or, you know?

33:41.934 --> 33:49.883
I mean, if I'd been able to knock up some juicy scandal... So much with British Kenwood attitudes on what makes a future story.

33:49.903 --> 33:50.143
Yeah.

33:51.305 --> 33:52.206
I was rather shocked.

33:52.987 --> 33:59.074
How do you, if we could talk briefly, if you don't mind, it's the kind of thing that might be useful for this...

33:59.678 --> 34:04.783
You don't have the same kind of cultural wars going on in your country that we have here, do you?

34:04.823 --> 34:06.044
What sort of cultural wars?

34:06.485 --> 34:08.547
Oh, I mean, on the campuses and the academy.

34:09.488 --> 34:11.550
Shakespeare, not being required reading.

34:11.590 --> 34:12.711
The Great Dead, White.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.693
Yeah.

34:15.834 --> 34:17.856
We get everything a bit later, as you know.

34:17.896 --> 34:23.081
Of course, Shakespeare is a national poet, and he should be everyone's national poet.

34:23.101 --> 34:23.702
It's shifting.

34:23.782 --> 34:25.764
I teach American literature in England.

34:26.485 --> 34:27.846
Now, that is interesting to me.

34:28.180 --> 34:35.050
And what I would have taught 20 years ago when I started, which would have been, you know, in the 19th century.

34:35.130 --> 34:36.813
Oh, I'm really interested in this.

34:36.833 --> 34:42.762
Melville, Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, Whitman, you know, Mark Twain, Poe, that's it.

34:42.782 --> 34:49.412
Now I get to teach Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe,

34:50.455 --> 34:59.990
R. Nigg, you know, those kinds of, you know, Life in the Iron Mills, those sorts of texts.

35:00.411 --> 35:07.141
And of course it's to do with the Norton Anthology and the way that sets the agenda for the teaching of American literature.

35:07.161 --> 35:13.812
But, you know, the canon is changing in that aspect where I'm teaching as well.

35:13.832 --> 35:15.855
Do you see it as one canon or a number of...

35:16.358 --> 35:17.279
little canons.

35:18.060 --> 35:20.905
Well, I'm very confused by the word canon, anyway.

35:21.125 --> 35:22.867
That's a new word.

35:22.887 --> 35:24.990
I mean, I'm an English major from the 60s, and we never used it.

35:25.030 --> 35:26.172
Never talked about the canon.

35:26.192 --> 35:32.561
And I went to a liberal arts school where, undoubtedly, we studied what is today called the canon.

35:32.581 --> 35:45.640
But I've been reading Alan Bloom and all these people and Stanley Fish and so on, and I think what is happening here is not happening yet in England, and it's one of the reasons it may be easier in some ways to teach

35:46.075 --> 35:49.841
at university level in Britain than it is in America.

35:49.881 --> 35:56.993
I think we're not so up against these fierce agendas about minorities and about culture.

35:57.033 --> 36:09.855
What I think is happening in Britain is there is a cultural war going on in some campuses between traditional literary studies and cultural studies, and I don't see why the two shouldn't.

36:10.527 --> 36:14.152
marry and mix, but there is a bit of a standoff, I think, about that.

36:14.232 --> 36:30.695
But I think that is what you find, and even to some extent, if you're teaching Arnig, and you're teaching Douglass, and you're teaching Stowe, I don't think anyone could argue that these are examples of great literature, those particular titles, for instance, but they're important.

36:30.715 --> 36:32.116
Yes, they're culturally important.

36:32.136 --> 36:33.278
I think Douglass is rather

36:33.562 --> 36:36.891
a good book, actually.

36:37.051 --> 36:43.287
But it's true that, you know, if you then... I have a first edition, however.

36:43.307 --> 36:43.688
Very interesting.

36:43.828 --> 36:47.959
Actually, another example of this, as in I do, um, I,

36:48.209 --> 36:52.317
I put Little Women on an American 19th century course.

36:52.377 --> 36:58.329
We only have nine-week semesters, so you have to really pick and choose, and it's a selected books course.

36:58.349 --> 37:05.222
And I remember a colleague, a traditionalist colleague of mine, an Americanist, absolutely outraged by my having done this ten years ago.

37:05.523 --> 37:08.767
What on earth have you put Louisa May Alcott on your course for?

37:08.887 --> 37:11.089
Well, that's a nice part.

37:11.109 --> 37:15.194
You should be teaching nothing but Emily Dickinson, Trane, Melville.

37:15.214 --> 37:20.840
And now, I mean, he wouldn't have a leg to stand on because she has been, as it were, canonized.

37:20.860 --> 37:22.201
She has been.

37:22.221 --> 37:23.623
I have a 14-year-old daughter.

37:23.663 --> 37:29.269
When she was 12, she really wanted to see Little Women in the movie, but she wouldn't...

37:29.637 --> 37:31.661
to see the tape until she'd read the whole book.

37:31.681 --> 37:32.222
Just for her.

37:32.382 --> 37:35.948
And she said, Dad, it's 476 pages.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.072
It's the longest book I've ever read.

37:38.092 --> 37:39.073
I said, honey, you're 12.

37:39.094 --> 37:43.301
I said, that's longer than most adults I've ever read.

37:43.641 --> 37:52.557
Well, speaking of this reading level and of the canon and of Virginia Woolf, what is very interesting to me is how few of her books are generally read.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.168
There are quite a lot of novels.

37:55.549 --> 38:02.679
The books of Virginia Woolf that get read are Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, A Room of One's Own.

38:03.540 --> 38:07.846
Maybe a little bit extra here and there, but basically that's generally it.

38:08.306 --> 38:10.870
Are you talking about in universities now?

38:10.890 --> 38:20.603
Well, actually, in universities, and also I go to bookshops and say, which Virginia Woolf books do you sell when I go and read in bookshops, and it's usually those.

38:21.190 --> 38:22.894
to the general public.

38:22.914 --> 38:28.046
But you were talking about your dismay over this whole concept of what a canon is.

38:28.727 --> 38:31.012
And I think maybe I interrupted you.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.957
I can't remember what I was saying.

38:34.861 --> 38:38.710
But we were talking about, you know,

38:39.230 --> 38:40.331
What is the canon?

38:40.351 --> 38:43.094
Is there a canon?

38:43.114 --> 38:44.255
It's like saying, what's pornography?

38:44.275 --> 38:45.737
You know it when you see it.

38:45.757 --> 38:50.842
Maybe, you know, we know that Shakespeare and Dante and Cervantes are... And Virginia Woolf.

38:50.862 --> 38:51.663
And Virginia Woolf.

38:52.144 --> 39:04.957
But when I was being taught at Oxford in the late 60s and doing graduate work there, she was... I put this in the book, actually, in terms of how she changes.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.380
She was described to me by my male tutor.

39:07.799 --> 39:15.948
as a minor figure in the modernist movement, not to be classed with Joyce or Eliot or Pound.

39:16.549 --> 39:20.112
And it, you know, it infiltrated my consciousness, that reading of it.

39:20.293 --> 39:21.714
Was it gender bias in your view?

39:21.734 --> 39:33.587
Well, I think it was gender bias now, but I think it was also, there were a lot of English critics, John Bailey, John Kerry, you know, a lot of distinguished English critics, men,

39:34.040 --> 39:40.627
but Queen Elis did it too, who have her down as a minor writer, you know, a not very good minor writer.

39:40.747 --> 39:43.971
And this is a very prevalent view of her in my country.

39:44.672 --> 39:46.213
Continuing to this day?

39:46.233 --> 39:47.074
Oh yes, oh yes.

39:48.636 --> 39:58.947
I have a sort of friendly ongoing argument with a couple of very well-known distinguished male critics in Britain who think that her writing is piffle.

39:59.828 --> 40:02.151
Well, I mean, you wouldn't dare say that here in the United States.

40:02.171 --> 40:03.372
No, it's a big difference.

40:03.807 --> 40:05.529
You do that at your peril.

40:05.549 --> 40:05.769
Yes.

40:06.250 --> 40:06.891
I won't try it.

40:07.391 --> 40:10.696
As a matter of fact, you often listen to me, and me haven't been.

40:10.716 --> 40:11.917
I wouldn't, you know.

40:13.519 --> 40:15.842
But that surprises me, really.

40:15.862 --> 40:16.983
No, it's true.

40:17.104 --> 40:18.445
It's a big difference.

40:19.226 --> 40:20.968
As I say, it's a class thing, partly.

40:20.988 --> 40:25.854
I think they think she's too... She's too privileged.

40:25.995 --> 40:33.544
She's too... David Lodge, writing a good book on Christmas in the modern novel, has this sentence, which I always...

40:34.115 --> 40:34.836
It interests me.

40:34.856 --> 40:40.342
He said, we do not always think of eternity while peeling potatoes, but Junior Wolf's characters always do.

40:40.862 --> 40:47.449
And he's thinking of Mrs. Ramsay pouring out the soup at the dinner party and thinking, my life has failed.

40:48.190 --> 40:49.452
And he thinks it's too spoiled.

40:49.472 --> 40:54.757
He thinks that if these people had a decent job, they wouldn't have the time to be doing this kind of inner thinking.

40:55.058 --> 40:59.903
You were talking about words that are new to us in context.

41:00.203 --> 41:05.990
a word that I've just recently come across, especially since I started this new study.

41:06.010 --> 41:14.740
This whole book I'm working on, this whole concept of book culture, books of the future, books, libraries, what's happening to printed text.

41:14.760 --> 41:18.905
Should be a guess, wouldn't you, at the prospect of a printed book?

41:20.106 --> 41:21.688
People actually have things being

41:22.141 --> 41:24.586
No, she was interested in technology.

41:25.367 --> 41:27.231
She was interested in new technology.

41:27.291 --> 41:33.724
She invents for herself the idea of a telephone where you can see people at the other end of the phone.

41:33.744 --> 41:40.437
She has a fantasy about an electronic device that would enable you to plug into the past.

41:40.872 --> 41:43.455
One of that crap's last tape.

41:43.715 --> 41:45.376
She's very interested in technology.

41:45.476 --> 41:50.021
I think she would have rather liked computers and audio books.

41:50.081 --> 41:54.065
She would not bemoan the passage of printed books as an artifact.

41:54.165 --> 41:56.107
Well, no, she would want to keep the print.

41:56.207 --> 41:58.749
I don't believe Sven Berkowitz, or whatever his name is.

41:58.810 --> 41:59.971
Berkowitz.

42:00.111 --> 42:02.353
The printed book kids.

42:02.373 --> 42:07.538
Well, I think he's very... He lives around here, as a matter of fact.

42:07.855 --> 42:09.817
Don't worry, he's at it within a hearing distance.

42:09.837 --> 42:10.898
We'll just miss that.

42:10.958 --> 42:13.000
I mean, I don't believe in the death of the book.

42:13.040 --> 42:22.049
I think people go on wanting to have a thing that they can, maybe not in this case, carry around with them, but, you know, have as their own thing and turn the pages.

42:22.069 --> 42:25.832
Yeah, well, there is a... By the way, what's your... We have two minutes.

42:26.092 --> 42:27.354
Two.

42:27.394 --> 42:27.754
Oh.

42:27.794 --> 42:30.016
Will you inscribe this for me?

42:30.036 --> 42:32.759
It's just I want to take a little break before the next day.

42:32.819 --> 42:33.379
Okay, good.

42:33.399 --> 42:34.260
Talking about American literature.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.103
It's deep irony, which is that my first job

42:37.522 --> 42:46.356
When I graduated from Oxford was as an English-speaking union Woodrow Wilson visiting junior fellow to America.

42:46.957 --> 42:53.427
And I went to William and Mary and had a wonderful year there and taught nothing but English literature.

42:54.008 --> 43:05.706
When I came back in 1971, I applied for every job that was going that summer in every English university and was interviewed at Liverpool University, where I spent the next seven years

43:06.361 --> 43:09.209
And at my interview, they said, oh, you've been in America.

43:09.249 --> 43:12.960
You'll obviously be able to teach our American Literature Program, which they were just evolving then.

43:13.041 --> 43:15.949
So I found it was very funny.

43:16.148 --> 43:20.232
Three months later, I had to give five lectures on Emerson.

43:20.252 --> 43:22.255
I shall never forget it, never having it.

43:22.275 --> 43:28.181
So I spent the whole summer reading The American Scholar and Nature and Self-Reliance.

43:28.201 --> 43:29.943
And actually, it took me a while to get into it.

43:29.963 --> 43:31.024
But I became an American.

43:31.064 --> 43:32.365
It's complete bison.

43:32.385 --> 43:37.451
And then I kind of got very interested in it and wrote on Roth and wrote on Willacather.

43:37.471 --> 43:39.613
And my next book is going to be on Edith Wharton.

43:40.634 --> 43:42.636
Very, very interesting.

43:43.057 --> 43:43.517
The right books?

43:43.537 --> 43:44.198
Not as long.
