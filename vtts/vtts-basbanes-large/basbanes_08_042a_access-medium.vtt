00:02.680 --> 00:06.726
Okay, we're talking to James McBride.

00:07.507 --> 00:11.353
Chris, you know, I read the book, so I don't have to ask you what you have to say.

00:11.373 --> 00:12.775
But tell me about it.

00:13.356 --> 00:14.898
You're a jazz musician.

00:14.918 --> 00:15.739
You're a journalist.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.462
Right.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.587
And we'll just put this closer.

00:21.248 --> 00:22.490
Okay.

00:23.992 --> 00:26.075
Tell me about the quest here.

00:26.275 --> 00:27.277
Oh, how it started?

00:27.537 --> 00:27.818
Yeah.

00:28.519 --> 00:31.523
Well, you know, I had reached the point where...

00:32.313 --> 00:37.040
I've reached the point where I had to discover who I was, basically, and that was about four years ago.

00:37.861 --> 00:43.409
That's when I got to be about 30, but really, you know, the rubber met the road around four years ago.

00:44.510 --> 00:55.806
And, you know, I reached the point where I sort of was going about the process of discovering who I was, and I realized I couldn't do that unless I discovered who my mother was.

00:55.988 --> 00:57.751
And you didn't know who your mother was?

00:57.771 --> 00:59.634
Well, not in a real true sense.

00:59.874 --> 01:02.638
You know, as you know, when I was a boy, she denied being white.

01:03.219 --> 01:06.023
And she refused to talk about her history for years and years.

01:06.063 --> 01:07.886
She would never talk about her past.

01:07.906 --> 01:10.711
You didn't know that she was the daughter of Orthodox Jews?

01:10.891 --> 01:14.436
I knew when I was about 15, 16 years old, I knew she was Jewish.

01:15.538 --> 01:19.825
And I also learned that she was the daughter of an Orthodox rabbi.

01:20.225 --> 01:22.248
But I had no idea what that meant.

01:22.268 --> 01:23.430
I had no idea what it meant.

01:24.085 --> 01:27.489
You know, you can't make stuff like this out.

01:27.509 --> 01:30.132
But see, you know, my siblings didn't know about it.

01:30.152 --> 01:31.994
In fact, they didn't.

01:32.034 --> 01:36.339
Most of the stuff they found out about mommy, they found out by leaving the post.

01:36.419 --> 01:37.921
Okay.

01:38.341 --> 01:40.364
How's that?

01:40.664 --> 01:46.991
No, I don't mind at all.

01:47.692 --> 01:50.295
No, most of the stuff they found out about her, they found out.

01:50.748 --> 01:51.609
by reading the book.

01:52.190 --> 01:58.078
So, it was, you know.

02:01.243 --> 02:04.267
So, you're talking here.

02:04.327 --> 02:08.273
I forgot what I was talking about.

02:08.413 --> 02:14.241
What were we talking about?

02:14.862 --> 02:16.344
You knew that she was Jewish.

02:16.465 --> 02:16.925
Oh, yeah.

02:16.945 --> 02:19.329
Well, I knew she was Jewish, but I had no idea what that meant.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.813
I hadn't, you know, I mean... And what do you mean you didn't know what it meant?

02:21.833 --> 02:23.897
I didn't know anything about Jewish people at all.

02:24.197 --> 02:26.280
I mean, I knew what most people know about Jews.

02:26.300 --> 02:31.188
In New York, what I knew about Jews as growing up in New York is there were a lot of them.

02:31.208 --> 02:33.933
And that on certain Jewish holidays, we didn't have to go to school.

02:34.474 --> 02:35.335
You know, that's about it.

02:35.355 --> 02:39.922
I mean, that's... It wasn't much... It didn't seem that there was much to know.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.186
It was only when I...

02:43.246 --> 02:46.630
went down south to visit her town in Suffolk.

02:47.090 --> 02:50.454
When I went to Suffolk, Virginia to visit where she grew up, that's when it really came out.

02:51.115 --> 03:00.345
Because what happened was, you know, she was really resistant to me talking to her about her life as a young girl.

03:00.946 --> 03:10.637
And a lot of that had to do with the fact that she was, you know, she suffered, you know, child abuses, you know, sexual molestation as a child, and her father was an abuser.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.161
And so a lot of that had to do with that.

03:15.022 --> 03:22.532
And a lot of it had to do with the fact that she just didn't know how fascinated I would be with it, or any of her children would be with it.

03:22.552 --> 03:27.057
Do you think she just didn't want this part of her history to be known?

03:27.078 --> 03:28.619
I mean, she has 12 children.

03:30.882 --> 03:33.986
No, I think that it wasn't, I don't think it had anything to do with that.

03:34.006 --> 03:40.675
I think it had to do with the fact that she had always tried to protect us from the world and raise us so that we wouldn't be confused kids.

03:41.566 --> 03:53.363
And I think by throwing in this whole element of her own Judaism and her own history, at least when we were little, which seemed to make it more confusing for us in her eyes.

03:53.443 --> 03:56.708
And also, just the talking about it was so painful for her.

03:56.728 --> 03:59.692
It was just like eating fire.

03:59.752 --> 04:07.243
I mean, you know, the way it sounds in the books, you know, the way it sounds in the book, it's like, you know, she's just sort of, you know, she's purging herself.

04:07.303 --> 04:09.286
It didn't exactly come out that way.

04:09.306 --> 04:10.307
I mean, it was a lot of

04:10.777 --> 04:18.326
dancing back and forth, a lot of, I can't tell you because you're my son, and you know, I can't talk to my son like this, and a lot of, you know, convincing.

04:18.346 --> 04:27.958
I mean, what really sort of brought her around was the fact that she wants to see her sister, and she's hoping that the book will sort of, you know, draw her sister out.

04:28.118 --> 04:31.422
That and the fact that I've been managed to convince her that I was going to do it regardless.

04:31.462 --> 04:32.223
Really?

04:32.524 --> 04:35.147
And that, you know, even if I wrote about myself,

04:35.532 --> 04:41.199
There's no way I could get around not writing about her, and that people would be inspired by her story, by her courage.

04:42.501 --> 04:45.224
She doesn't see herself like most people who are in those positions.

04:45.244 --> 04:49.209
They never see themselves as being courageous or doing heroic things.

04:49.229 --> 04:52.373
They just see themselves as doing what they need to do to survive.

04:52.653 --> 04:59.001
And, of course, it's more than just the circumstances of where she came from and what she came from.

04:59.461 --> 05:00.763
Look what she did with her children.

05:01.503 --> 05:03.725
Look at the product, my God.

05:03.945 --> 05:14.156
It would have been so easy with that many kids and, you know, given tough times and stuff, you guys could have gone another way.

05:14.176 --> 05:18.260
Well, she just was relentless in terms of her view of education.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.943
I mean, when I was a kid, college was a foregoing conclusion.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.845
There was no debating.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.287
You were going to go to college.

05:26.107 --> 05:30.852
And this whole element of school, I think, you know, in terms of her

05:31.405 --> 05:42.218
school, she would just, in that way, I think she showed her so-called Jewishness, if there's such a thing, because she was absolutely insistent that we go to Jewish schools.

05:42.778 --> 05:44.080
We were the only kids in our neighborhood.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.682
You must have sensed something at that point.

05:45.702 --> 05:48.024
Well, no, I just, no, it wasn't that.

05:48.104 --> 05:59.758
She just, I don't know, I mean, I can't say that, because I just thought my mother was a weird person, and I desperately wanted to be like, I desperately wanted her to look like and be like my friend's mothers, who were all black,

06:00.228 --> 06:06.276
who sent their kids to the local school, and she wasn't, you know.

06:06.336 --> 06:09.480
And so you'd be surprised.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.964
I mean, there are people who live with denial for years and years.

06:13.044 --> 06:18.652
You know, like a person who's an alcoholic can be an alcoholic for years and years and not admit it and not even know it.

06:18.872 --> 06:20.494
It's such an interesting turn.

06:21.495 --> 06:25.881
Just exactly at this time last year, I went down to Martha's Vineyard and did an interview with Dorothy West.

06:26.485 --> 06:28.949
You know, Dorothy West is... She's like an old... She's 87.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.391
She's probably 88 now.

06:31.273 --> 06:34.137
And she's the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance.

06:34.578 --> 06:38.525
And she... And all these other people.

06:39.506 --> 06:40.768
Extraordinary people.

06:41.690 --> 06:43.252
And she wrote this book called The Wedding.

06:43.272 --> 06:49.242
And, of course, what she talks about is black people passing for... That's an expression that... Right.

06:49.322 --> 06:50.384
Passing for white.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.307
This is an inversion, isn't it?

06:52.642 --> 06:53.704
Yeah, you know.

06:53.724 --> 06:54.945
A very interesting inversion.

06:54.965 --> 06:58.310
Well, you know, Mommy's a weird lady.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.934
I mean, she's definitely not your average mother.

07:01.135 --> 07:05.321
I mean, she was perceived as an African-American woman, it seems to me.

07:05.361 --> 07:09.427
Well, yeah, she did, because she felt that was where she was accepted.

07:10.148 --> 07:13.473
And that's where she ultimately felt like she belonged.

07:13.653 --> 07:19.662
I mean, even though, you know, she was raised as a Jewish person, she did feel...

07:20.165 --> 07:27.375
You know, on some level still feels a little bit like she belongs in black America because black America embraced her and didn't judge her.

07:27.415 --> 07:29.678
She says that about black people, even today.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.962
You know, her friends are the ones who are still living, you know.

07:33.824 --> 07:42.055
Don't ask her what school that her son went to or, you know, was he a summa cum laude graduate?

07:42.435 --> 07:44.538
They don't ask her those kinds of questions.

07:44.558 --> 07:46.701
They ask her basic questions.

07:46.721 --> 07:47.482
Is everyone healthy?

07:47.502 --> 07:49.665
Is everyone alive?

07:49.949 --> 07:54.633
you know, because they, I guess they know the level of pain that my mother's gone through.

07:54.673 --> 07:57.676
You know, her friends have experienced pain too.

07:57.696 --> 08:09.707
Some of her old black friends, you know, they had their son, you know, she's watched her friend's sons and daughters die of age and, you know, sort of the urban problems sort of overtake her friends' families.

08:09.747 --> 08:13.871
And so she understands, and she doesn't ask them questions.

08:13.891 --> 08:17.374
I mean, it's just sort of like, I guess it's this understanding of how to deal with pain.

08:18.275 --> 08:19.956
And she had come from so much pain

08:20.324 --> 08:23.527
that she just felt, she's always felt very comfortable around black people.

08:23.547 --> 08:25.369
And Mommy's a non-judgmental person.

08:26.290 --> 08:27.771
You should call her Mommy.

08:27.791 --> 08:28.512
Yeah, Mommy, yeah.

08:29.033 --> 08:32.957
I mean, people, you know, I say that, but yeah, I still call her Mommy.

08:33.137 --> 08:33.717
We all do.

08:34.218 --> 08:36.020
I mean, she's still got the power at 74.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.563
You know, she's still... There's no question, right?

08:39.583 --> 08:41.425
It's not democracy when you sit around the table.

08:41.445 --> 08:50.314
No, it's not democracy, which is weird because, you know, when you think back to, you know, her father, you know, he was a, you know, he was, it wasn't a democracy either.

08:50.902 --> 08:52.344
He was autonomous, is that the word?

08:53.265 --> 08:58.110
You know, he was the one and only, you know, isolated rule of the house.

08:58.871 --> 09:02.855
And Mommy in my house was the one and only isolated rule.

09:02.875 --> 09:07.140
I mean, there wasn't any debate, you know.

09:07.160 --> 09:14.108
And, of course, a factor is, when you talk about making 180 degrees, the fact that

09:14.712 --> 09:17.035
The fact that her family did a shiva for her.

09:17.215 --> 09:18.236
She's dead, basically.

09:18.256 --> 09:18.797
Right, yeah.

09:18.837 --> 09:20.038
They said shiva for her.

09:20.058 --> 09:21.520
Yeah, they said shiva.

09:22.001 --> 09:28.308
Yeah, I mean, you know, and when I first learned about that, I was angry about it.

09:28.808 --> 09:37.879
But then I learned about how Orthodox Jews lived, you know, lived in that time, and how her family, I'd say I learned how her family lived.

09:38.540 --> 09:41.243
And when I learned how her family lived and what they believed,

09:42.134 --> 09:49.542
It was in character for them to do that, and it wasn't anything... I don't see anything wrong with it, you know?

09:50.023 --> 09:55.889
I mean, uh... I don't think it had anything to do at all with the fact that she was marrying a black man.

09:55.949 --> 09:59.934
I think it's the fact that she was leaving this... She's leaving that world.

09:59.954 --> 10:01.515
She could have married a Greek like me.

10:01.535 --> 10:05.520
It wouldn't have made any difference.

10:05.540 --> 10:05.980
That's right.

10:06.000 --> 10:06.661
That's right, yeah.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.563
She's leaving that world, and...

10:09.252 --> 10:12.076
And it wasn't a pleasant experience for them to see.

10:12.876 --> 10:15.740
And also, you know, they were going through their own problems.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.964
I mean, not knowing what to keep, not knowing what to leave behind.

10:19.064 --> 10:32.361
And when you think about how some of these immigrant families come to America and the kind of suffering they have, you know, the suffering that they experience.

10:32.381 --> 10:36.786
Our family certainly experienced a lot of anti-Semitism growing up in the South.

10:36.806 --> 10:37.487
But you talk about it.

10:38.125 --> 11:01.498
I mean, to go from, you know, this tradition, a tradition, what's the word I'm looking for, and this heritage of a really suppressed people during the Holocaust, and now to come to the United States and New York and go through it again.

11:01.518 --> 11:02.319
And go through it again.

11:03.981 --> 11:06.124
Does she articulate her?

11:06.408 --> 11:07.750
feelings on this?

11:08.051 --> 11:20.492
Well, you know, she doesn't really see herself, you know, the pain that she's experienced in her life, she just, it just slips off her like she's got, you know, you know how those wrestlers put oil on each other so they can't grab each other?

11:20.873 --> 11:28.145
She's just like, God is her oil, you know, and she just wears that oil and everything just bounces off like water.

11:28.165 --> 11:32.112
I mean, she doesn't really feel

11:32.918 --> 11:39.649
When we were young, I can remember people calling her honky and nigger lover.

11:39.709 --> 11:43.496
I remember when I was getting on the escalator, one time she was leading about six of us.

11:44.257 --> 11:48.184
This white man pushed her and called her nigger lover and all kinds of names.

11:48.244 --> 11:51.669
This was on the escalator, in the subway in Manhattan.

11:52.230 --> 11:55.536
I was a boy, you know, and mommy just ignored it.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.162
She ignored any of those kind of insults unless they affected her children.

11:59.513 --> 12:02.677
I mean, if they were directed at us, she would fight back ferociously.

12:02.777 --> 12:05.781
But otherwise, it didn't bother her.

12:05.801 --> 12:06.542
Even now, it doesn't.

12:07.022 --> 12:12.830
And it's interesting, because I've reached a point in my life where that kind of stuff doesn't bother me either.

12:12.850 --> 12:13.551
Now, how about you?

12:13.571 --> 12:15.313
Now, what does your father figure into this?

12:16.294 --> 12:20.740
Well, my father, my biological father, died before I was born.

12:20.800 --> 12:27.428
My stepfather, my parents, you know, my stepfather and father,

12:27.965 --> 12:39.179
were a curious blend of, you know, Jewish-American paranoia and Black-American distrust into the house, in that they didn't really care too much about what the outside world did or thought.

12:39.199 --> 12:42.062
My stepfather, you could call him any name in the book, it didn't matter to him.

12:42.243 --> 12:48.170
All he cared about was our grades and did we go to church on Sunday.

12:48.210 --> 12:54.057
He didn't really care about, you know, he'd grown up in the Jim Crow South and, you know, he didn't even talk about

12:54.425 --> 12:59.270
his experiences in the Jim Crow South, refused to, just didn't want to discuss it.

12:59.330 --> 13:01.312
All he wanted to talk about was the future.

13:01.992 --> 13:05.936
He felt that the past was over and that what was done was done.

13:05.976 --> 13:12.583
He used to, the only time he would talk about race, he would occasionally mention there was an Italian guy who gave him a job when he worked for the city.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.747
He was a furnace farmer for the New York City Housing Authority.

13:16.767 --> 13:23.453
And there was an Italian guy who got him the job, which was actually illegal because my father had been arrested for

13:23.872 --> 13:26.915
making illegal booze during the drawing 20s.

13:26.975 --> 13:28.477
Grandfather had the same problem.

13:28.497 --> 13:29.238
Right, you know.

13:29.898 --> 13:35.464
So they weren't supposed to hire him, but this Italian guy got him that job.

13:36.185 --> 13:38.307
And he would always say, he would always mention that.

13:38.327 --> 13:39.268
He often would mention that.

13:39.288 --> 13:48.698
He'd say, well, you know, look, you know, because any time there's racial talk, we'd start flying around the house, my elder siblings would say, well, you know, well, how come white people don't really, you know,

13:49.133 --> 13:52.616
And my stuff, I would say, you know, I don't know what you're talking about.

13:52.636 --> 13:54.017
This man gave me a good job.

13:54.218 --> 13:55.239
He didn't know me from Adam.

13:55.879 --> 14:00.083
And you can't go around saying them because you don't know them.

14:00.123 --> 14:08.170
You know, he just wasn't, my parents weren't very, they didn't really care so much about what the outside world did or thought.

14:08.270 --> 14:12.014
They only cared what happened within the confines of the world that they created.

14:12.955 --> 14:18.820
So, you know, during the racially, you know, charged times of the 60s,

14:19.441 --> 14:29.053
It's a difficult period in my house because, you know, during the late 60s, my father, my stepfather, was very old, and then he died in 1972.

14:30.255 --> 14:36.783
And during that period, like, from 65 to 75, you know, Mommy had to really sort of rein us in.

14:36.803 --> 14:47.337
She was sort of like the one who really had to deal with the, you know, all the lip service of the 60s that we would bring into the house, especially with all the siblings.

14:47.357 --> 14:48.418
We talk about...

14:49.597 --> 14:53.462
First of all, I mean, you've got four siblings that are doctors, is that right?

14:53.482 --> 14:56.785
No, I got two who are doctors.

14:56.846 --> 14:59.388
They're all like caretakers, you know, a bunch of teachers.

14:59.429 --> 15:00.570
One's a chemist.

15:00.870 --> 15:02.172
Caretakers and what respect?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.314
Well, you know, none are really business.

15:04.334 --> 15:05.756
I think one is like a business.

15:05.856 --> 15:06.817
They're professionals, yeah.

15:08.139 --> 15:10.642
One's the chairman of the History Department of Penn State.

15:11.423 --> 15:12.964
They're all very, you know.

15:12.984 --> 15:14.546
I got my master's degree in Penn State.

15:14.566 --> 15:15.127
Oh, did you really?

15:15.968 --> 15:16.068
Yeah.

15:16.088 --> 15:17.009
That's far from here.

15:17.890 --> 15:18.591
Yeah, well.

15:19.448 --> 15:25.096
I got some money to go there that helps, you know.

15:25.116 --> 15:29.602
Kept me out of the service for another year.

15:30.243 --> 15:36.732
Anyway, I mean, yeah, we just follow one after the other.

15:37.333 --> 15:42.520
We just, you know, we knew Dennis went to college, oh, and then Billy went to college, and Billy said,

15:42.702 --> 15:47.548
Okay, I'm going to college, but just because Dennis goes to Europe, I am not going to Europe, you know.

15:47.568 --> 15:49.891
Okay, well, you don't have to go to Europe, but you have to go to college.

15:49.931 --> 15:54.598
I mean, it was just... It was a complete, so to speak.

15:54.718 --> 15:55.198
Absolutely.

15:55.459 --> 15:57.361
It was just unquestioned.

15:57.501 --> 16:08.276
And, of course, when you talk about taking the tests and applying for schools... Well, we were expected to do that, but Mommy would fill out the financial aid form.

16:08.296 --> 16:11.680
We were expected to select colleges and...

16:11.913 --> 16:19.523
do all that by ourselves on our own, but Mommy was the one who filled out the applications for financial aid because she knew how to put those zeros in the right place.

16:19.803 --> 16:20.864
And everybody was?

16:21.125 --> 16:22.226
Oh, yeah.

16:22.246 --> 16:27.293
I mean, we got, all of us, it took years to pay back, you know, all of us paid back school loans over.

16:27.313 --> 16:28.574
I mean, we had a lot of loans.

16:28.714 --> 16:29.535
And were there scholarships?

16:29.555 --> 16:38.747
There were scholarships available, and how it worked for most of us was they'd give us a big scholarship the first year, and then gradually decrease the scholarship and increase the loans.

16:39.335 --> 16:44.662
And then by the time, you know, by the time you got out of school, you were... And maybe some of the schools where the siblings went to?

16:44.762 --> 16:45.303
Oh, a bunch of it.

16:45.323 --> 16:49.187
Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, Oberlin, Columbia.

16:49.288 --> 16:50.930
That's spectacular.

16:50.950 --> 16:53.193
Uh, Adelphi, Syracuse.

16:53.873 --> 16:55.596
Not a clunker among them.

16:55.616 --> 16:57.939
Uh, yeah, all, they all went to pretty good schools.

16:57.959 --> 17:02.885
Uh, let's see, uh, Lincoln University, that was a, that was a big one.

17:02.905 --> 17:04.187
That was a really good black school.

17:04.207 --> 17:05.248
It still is.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.611
I heard Charles Blockson.

17:07.631 --> 17:08.532
Yeah, he's, uh,

17:09.322 --> 17:10.043
He's in my book.

17:10.984 --> 17:11.725
He's a friend of mine.

17:11.905 --> 17:12.306
Oh, really?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.789
I profile him in my book.

17:14.829 --> 17:17.592
He's a great football player.

17:17.813 --> 17:18.193
Right.

17:18.213 --> 17:22.338
He turned down an offer from the New York Giants.

17:22.879 --> 17:25.202
He was Lenny Moore's roommate at Penn State.

17:25.362 --> 17:26.964
Great, great ball player.

17:26.984 --> 17:33.752
And he went out to become this book collector and to create this great African-American library, which is now at Temple University.

17:34.213 --> 17:35.835
And to me, he's one of the great, great

17:36.170 --> 17:39.614
This is a guy that could have been a pro football player.

17:40.596 --> 17:44.881
And Lenny Moore told me, he said, I thought he was nuts when he walked away from that job.

17:45.001 --> 17:45.722
Is he still living?

17:46.182 --> 17:47.364
Charles is a young man.

17:47.384 --> 17:49.527
I was just talking to him two years ago, yeah.

17:50.047 --> 17:51.269
Wonderful, wonderful guy.

17:51.429 --> 17:53.972
He's curator of his own collection down at Temple.

17:53.992 --> 17:55.855
In Philadelphia?

17:55.975 --> 17:56.075
Yeah.

17:56.095 --> 18:02.683
But to me, you talk about aspiring, making models, and there's a point here.

18:03.068 --> 18:05.552
The role model for you guys is your mother, isn't it?

18:05.632 --> 18:06.473
Yeah, absolutely.

18:06.493 --> 18:11.841
You're talking about a role model, an uplifting book about role models.

18:11.881 --> 18:16.307
Every role model doesn't have to be a male basketball player or a football player.

18:16.368 --> 18:18.250
Or it could be a white woman in the ghetto.

18:18.831 --> 18:19.332
There you go.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.775
I mean, you know, this whole thing about this whole thing.

18:21.796 --> 18:22.957
I mean, you see I'm going with this.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.540
Yeah, I mean, it makes a lot of sense.

18:24.640 --> 18:30.308
I mean, you know, a lot of black people who know mommy have, you know, tremendous respect for our young people.

18:30.524 --> 18:35.830
Friends of mine, you know, who I grew up with, friends of my siblings, they have a lot of respect for mine.

18:35.850 --> 18:38.894
They're very proud that this book is out because they remember mommy.

18:38.974 --> 18:40.096
I mean, she was hard to miss.

18:41.017 --> 18:46.083
And even though she was very private, she was very, she was and always is.

18:46.383 --> 18:48.746
She was always very kind, known as a very kind person.

18:49.147 --> 18:50.068
She minded her business.

18:50.188 --> 18:51.610
She didn't, you know, start trouble.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.812
She didn't gossip about neighbor's kids and so forth.

18:54.253 --> 18:55.534
But she was always very kind.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.658
I think that was something I really didn't kind of, I don't know if I got there.

18:58.874 --> 19:05.220
I made that clear in the book because I was so, you know, so many things to get, so much ground to cover.

19:05.821 --> 19:10.906
But she's a very socially welfare kind of person.

19:10.946 --> 19:15.891
She's a social welfare kind of person in that she believes in welfare.

19:15.991 --> 19:22.798
I mean, she thinks welfare, when it's done properly, works, you know, because a lot of her friends who, we were never on welfare.

19:22.838 --> 19:26.181
We weren't, she just, we didn't go in that direction.

19:26.701 --> 19:31.886
But we knew and she knew many people who were, many of whom got off, many of whom became successful.

19:32.847 --> 19:42.616
And, you know, that whole Franklin D. Roosevelt, the whole social security system that gave you money for your kids, you know, until they were like 18 or something like that.

19:43.156 --> 19:46.079
That was a lot of that was our bread and butter for many years.

19:46.099 --> 19:51.644
And not to mention the fact that she worked and my stepfather worked.

19:51.664 --> 19:54.126
She, you know, she brought a...

19:54.663 --> 20:04.396
You know, these people who talk about biracial kids, like, you know, if you're a white couple, you can't adopt a black kid, you shouldn't adopt a black kid, or if you're a, or vice versa.

20:05.318 --> 20:06.680
That's just misguided pride.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.402
That's all that is.

20:08.422 --> 20:10.825
Especially if somebody can really help his child.

20:11.086 --> 20:13.349
I mean, who would you rather have your kid raised by?

20:13.489 --> 20:23.623
A crack addict, you know, who's proud of his, our prisons are full of proud black and white people who are proud of their ethnic heritage, whatever it might be.

20:24.262 --> 20:25.243
We have to move beyond.

20:25.283 --> 20:33.952
I think that's, you know, I think that mommy's a living example of what happens when you move beyond the differences.

20:34.292 --> 20:39.557
When I write this story, I'll send you a copy, if you'd like, of my Jamaican King piece, because she talks about this.

20:39.597 --> 20:42.801
She never uses the word grace sometimes.

20:42.821 --> 20:46.304
You know, she has a white husband and her children.

20:47.185 --> 20:54.252
And when we were talking, they were talking now about some people want to make the census classifications, like if you have

20:55.227 --> 21:02.213
mixed, if the children have mixed racial background, they want to put a mixed, which is ridiculous, isn't it?

21:02.233 --> 21:02.413
Oh, God.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.435
The name is my will put all of us in it.

21:04.655 --> 21:07.798
And there are people on both sides who don't want it.

21:07.818 --> 21:10.120
I mean, conservatives as well as Republicans.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.001
It's the stupidest damn thing I've ever seen.

21:12.242 --> 21:16.045
But she says race is just another way of enforcing power.

21:16.425 --> 21:22.370
And so she tries not to, she doesn't really talk about it, she says, and it's consistent.

21:22.390 --> 21:24.092
You see it in the writing.

21:24.152 --> 21:24.492
Interesting.

21:24.623 --> 21:25.324
That's true.

21:25.404 --> 21:27.228
That's kind of what you're talking about here.

21:27.288 --> 21:30.975
So, what were you talking about?

21:32.317 --> 21:35.423
Let's talk about the significance of the title, okay?

21:35.523 --> 21:43.058
And I think that's a wonderful title, and explain how she gave you that.

21:45.122 --> 21:47.526
You know, the thing about Mommy is that

21:48.586 --> 21:50.708
you know, mommy was making this up as she went along.

21:51.008 --> 22:05.863
I mean, you know, she had, by the time I got to be of age, she had sort of developed some pat answers and pat behavior patterns that she could use to sort of fend off the truth and sort of keep you, you know, keep me bouncing along.

22:06.444 --> 22:12.370
She was like a juggler who juggled like all these lies and just was constantly... Lies is the word, they're like DDS, right?

22:12.390 --> 22:13.190
Lies, yeah.

22:13.591 --> 22:15.893
You know, she was just constantly juggling these

22:16.295 --> 22:19.599
you know, these 12 different... No, lies, which could have been... Oh, I see.

22:19.619 --> 22:20.199
Yeah, no, no.

22:20.540 --> 22:28.629
Yeah, well, she could juggle a few untruths, too, but no, she was juggling... When I come to transcribe this thing, I want to be sure that... No, I'm referring to lives.

22:29.450 --> 22:30.291
L-I-V-E-S.

22:30.311 --> 22:45.188
Yeah, she was constantly juggling all these different lives and needs and wants, and she grew very deft at manipulating us, extremely deft at manipulating us, and that was one of her gifts as a mother, in addition to the fact that she could...

22:45.421 --> 22:47.263
What, was she trying to protect you from something?

22:47.303 --> 22:50.547
Well, yeah, because she felt the world was not going to be that friendly to us.

22:50.567 --> 23:01.381
I mean, she knew what it was like to be scorned in a lot of ways, not just, first of all, growing up as a Jew in, you know, an anti-Semitic circumstance.

23:02.362 --> 23:11.794
You know, it's just, and then being in a mixed marriage in the 1940s where she couldn't even travel to the South with her husband and being chased around New York, you know.

23:11.854 --> 23:14.297
She said they were chased around New York quite a bit when they were

23:14.632 --> 23:18.016
married and they were, you know, they were attacked and so forth.

23:18.677 --> 23:19.918
A pariah to everybody.

23:19.938 --> 23:28.168
I mean, you know, two, you know, really, and she says that there were other mixed marriages during that period, but they never lasted.

23:28.208 --> 23:32.473
They, you know, they would last for a year or two and they would break up.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.237
So, come to the title here.

23:35.677 --> 23:40.403
Well, the title is because I would ask her, you know, what color is God, you know, I'd ask her,

23:40.636 --> 23:41.597
Is God black and white?

23:41.637 --> 23:43.099
Now, why would you ask for that question?

23:43.119 --> 23:53.252
Because it occurred to me that when, as a boy, that the world was a world of black and white, in my limited experience.

23:53.592 --> 24:03.885
And all the pictures of God and Jesus in Sunday school, they always showed a guy in white robes, you know, flowing hair, who looked like Jesus Christ superstar.

24:04.626 --> 24:07.690
So, you know, I would put that question to mommy and

24:08.210 --> 24:11.194
Our response was that God is the spirit and that he's the color of water.

24:11.554 --> 24:16.140
See, our minister, we went to churches where, you know, it was just fire and brimstone.

24:16.160 --> 24:23.570
It wasn't like deep theological, religious, you know, thinking that was like sort of handed down.

24:23.590 --> 24:29.798
I mean, not when I was, you know, because my father was a very deep thinker, but he was dead when I was, by the time I was born.

24:29.998 --> 24:31.180
I mean, our churches were just,

24:32.206 --> 24:38.156
You know, it was just a basic throwdown, you know, we're so glad the gospel is done.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.418
You know, it was all that.

24:39.659 --> 24:44.086
And you just sat there until your butt got flat, and then it was time to go home.

24:45.228 --> 24:57.910
And so, you know, the deep, pondering questions about life's deeper meanings and one's connection to God were rarely, if ever, answered by our ministers or our Sunday school teachers.

24:58.463 --> 25:02.807
And the deep questions of life, my siblings and I usually pond them among ourselves.

25:03.387 --> 25:12.876
And if you were lucky, you had five minutes along with Mommy where you could throw it at her, and she might give you a response that was credible, you know, or believable.

25:13.436 --> 25:15.738
Now, where were you in terms of... I'm the eighth.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.219
You're the eighth.

25:17.239 --> 25:18.981
I was one of the younger ones.

25:19.001 --> 25:21.243
Okay, so there are four younger ones.

25:21.263 --> 25:23.225
There are four younger ones, yeah, than me.

25:23.925 --> 25:27.188
And did you discuss your intention to do this with...

25:27.961 --> 25:45.944
No, yeah, with some of them, like my sister, my older sister was at her, and they knew I was doing it, but after a while, you'd be surprised, and a family of 12 kids, now with 12 kids plus spouses plus, you know, grandchildren.

25:45.964 --> 25:47.265
They're pretty much all over the place?

25:47.526 --> 25:57.158
Well, probably about two-thirds of them in the New York, New Jersey area, New York, between New York and Philadelphia, and the rest are in Atlanta, Georgia.

25:57.830 --> 26:00.013
with the exception of one who's in North Carolina.

26:02.016 --> 26:07.925
There's so much activity in my family that there are always two or three things going on that are prominent, you know.

26:08.366 --> 26:11.731
This, you know, the din of orchestrated chaos just continues.

26:12.452 --> 26:14.995
Even as a kid, you know, our house was constant chaos.

26:15.015 --> 26:26.833
You know, there'd be a Monopoly game here, you know, dominoes there, a football game over there, two kids dressed in football helmet, fur coats, and high heels in July, you know, acting like the New York Giants.

26:26.873 --> 26:27.634
I mean, it was just...

26:28.289 --> 26:33.518
And that kind of walking shade of chaos continues today on a grown-up scale.

26:33.538 --> 26:38.947
So above the den, occasionally, like, a big event arises, you know, like, oh, Dennis is graduating from college.

26:38.967 --> 26:44.076
And so, you know, the whole groundswell of activity sort of, all the searchlights sort of focus on that.

26:44.156 --> 26:47.502
And then ten minutes later, it's over, and then, you know, then it's this chaos.

26:47.522 --> 26:49.245
Well, what's the reaction to the book?

26:49.265 --> 26:52.330
Well, the reaction to the book is that this book has risen to the fore now.

26:52.410 --> 26:53.352
This book is sort of...

26:53.585 --> 26:55.928
you know, risen to the fore of the orchestrated chaos.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.111
You're on stage now.

26:58.131 --> 27:03.898
Yeah, I'm the king for just, I'm getting my, look, I'm seven and a half minutes in to my 15 minutes.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.140
As far as the family is concerned.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.062
I'm about, you know.

27:07.362 --> 27:08.563
There's going to be a movie out of this.

27:08.784 --> 27:11.307
Yeah, well, then I'll get another seven, you know.

27:11.687 --> 27:19.176
You know, but after that, you know, this book is going to get, my family can swallow any event.

27:20.017 --> 27:23.001
Like, you know, just like the big, you know, like,

27:23.858 --> 27:28.863
Like the big, you know, what's the monster on television, Godzilla, you know, and then it's done.

27:29.463 --> 27:30.805
And, you know, like a burp, burp.

27:30.965 --> 27:32.066
And then, you know, what's next?

27:32.166 --> 27:44.958
Because it's just, you have these 13 different individuals, 12 different individuals, who are still following, you know, my confused, crazy, sort of paranoid, but always number one mom.

27:45.218 --> 27:49.182
What prompted your mother to go to college in her 60s?

27:49.202 --> 27:51.444
That's another whole story in its own right, isn't it?

27:51.804 --> 27:53.646
Yeah, well, you know what it is.

27:54.065 --> 27:58.053
For one, she sent all of us, and she really does enjoy learning.

27:58.253 --> 28:03.142
She loves learning, and she loves reading, and she likes to talk about writers and writing, you know.

28:03.162 --> 28:08.212
She's into, you know, she always believed in education and knowledge.

28:08.733 --> 28:10.877
But you are the writer of the family, right?

28:10.897 --> 28:12.199
Yeah, I'm the writer of the family, yeah.

28:12.219 --> 28:15.145
So in a way, then, she must have really thought this was cool, in a way.

28:15.513 --> 28:21.842
When you're talking to my mother, it's like looking at a hand from both sides.

28:22.403 --> 28:24.446
This side tells you everything is great.

28:24.466 --> 28:26.569
This side is saying, hell no, we won't go.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.431
She's been like that her whole life.

28:28.732 --> 28:31.276
She's yes, no, yes, no, yes, no.

28:31.616 --> 28:33.799
Even in the book, you can read between the lines.

28:33.819 --> 28:42.051
You can see that there's sort of a yes, no, I want to talk to you, I don't want to talk to you, Helen in the way she talks about herself.

28:43.273 --> 28:44.895
Studs Terkel, who

28:45.702 --> 28:48.547
You know, I did his radio show.

28:48.607 --> 28:50.630
I was going to ask you about that.

28:50.931 --> 28:52.473
Well, I just met him last week.

28:52.553 --> 28:53.916
Well, actually, I did him in New York.

28:54.496 --> 28:58.102
Oh, you weren't part of the... Oh, you went to New York to interview him?

28:58.263 --> 29:00.647
Yeah, I'd go to New York for interviews, too.

29:00.667 --> 29:01.748
Oh, do you?

29:02.490 --> 29:03.131
Anyway, go ahead.

29:03.151 --> 29:03.471
I'm sorry.

29:03.652 --> 29:04.533
Anyway, he was great.

29:04.573 --> 29:07.778
And, you know, he does a lot of first-person accounts.

29:08.219 --> 29:09.361
That's his thing, you know.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.845
And he said, you know, he could read between the lines that,

29:12.483 --> 29:14.866
She didn't want to do it, but she did want to do it.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.427
And he really had it right, you know.

29:16.487 --> 29:17.108
She didn't want to do it.

29:17.208 --> 29:18.990
At first, she really did not want to do it.

29:19.671 --> 29:23.034
But then she gradually agreed to do it.

29:23.074 --> 29:25.137
She never really kind of consented, you know.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.498
But it was like a yes, no.

29:26.778 --> 29:30.803
I mean, that's Mommy's whole, you know, contradictions just smack against each other.

29:30.823 --> 29:35.308
Like, what for you was the biggest surprise?

29:35.528 --> 29:39.452
Well, I guess the biggest surprise,

29:40.360 --> 29:43.965
The biggest surprise was learning that her father was a child molester.

29:43.985 --> 29:47.209
Because that really took a long time for that to come out.

29:47.270 --> 29:53.118
That came out when she was back and forth, and she was saying, I can't tell you, you're my son.

29:53.138 --> 29:59.827
And she finally wrote the word M-O-L-E-S-T on a piece of paper, just stuck in the front of my face.

30:00.408 --> 30:03.532
That was a hard hit to deal with, I felt like.

30:03.552 --> 30:09.220
And do you suspect that that was what occasioned her leaving?

30:10.027 --> 30:22.364
No, I think that it was a culmination of her father gradually dismantling his family, because he himself, and this is just a theory, did not know how to adjust to American life.

30:23.125 --> 30:36.743
You know, he came here as a rabbi from Poland, sent over for his family, you know, he was married to a disabled woman who didn't speak English, and he ends up leaving her for a Gentile,

30:38.056 --> 30:41.301
who had four kids, something like that.

30:41.341 --> 30:50.293
And I just think he was one of these confused, dysfunctional people, man, who, you know, sometimes, who you sometimes run into.

30:51.074 --> 30:52.817
You know, his son ran up when he was 15.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.123
My mother ran up when she was 18 or so.

30:57.904 --> 31:00.988
So obviously he had, you know, he was not... Can you explain why she ran up?

31:01.729 --> 31:06.876
Well, yeah, if she couldn't, you know, her father divorced her mother.

31:06.896 --> 31:07.557
And, um,

31:08.431 --> 31:14.297
When he divorced her mother, she had reached the age of 18, and she just wanted her own money.

31:15.318 --> 31:16.759
And they didn't talk to you.

31:16.779 --> 31:18.901
The parents didn't want to talk to each other.

31:18.921 --> 31:19.982
The father would talk to her.

31:20.563 --> 31:21.544
She would talk to the mother.

31:21.584 --> 31:25.207
Of course, her mother didn't speak English, so she was translating for her mother.

31:26.088 --> 31:33.495
Her mother was getting sick, and she saw no future for herself down in Suffolk, Virginia.

31:33.515 --> 31:35.417
It was isolation upon isolation.

31:35.650 --> 31:43.317
Do you think your mother made a conscious decision to enter the black community, or did she fall in love with her man?

31:43.478 --> 32:05.539
I think she made a conscious decision to go where she felt most comfortable, and having grown up on the side of town where blacks were when she was a little girl, when she came to New York, it just seemed logical to her to go in a place where she was both comfortable and excited to be.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.170
You know, she always talks about Harlem in those years.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.291
It was really exciting.

32:09.351 --> 32:11.033
There's some wonderful books now.

32:11.053 --> 32:12.014
Harlem was involved.

32:12.034 --> 32:13.156
Yeah, yeah.

32:13.176 --> 32:16.579
I mean, you know, in the 40s, Harlem was, well, before that, too, you know.

32:16.599 --> 32:19.863
There's some books about it, which is just very terrific.

32:19.883 --> 32:23.147
So tell me about, we've got a few more minutes.

32:23.167 --> 32:24.028
You know, you're a musician.

32:24.048 --> 32:25.709
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.332
I'm a, you know, I play piano, saxophone.

32:28.432 --> 32:29.834
I play piano to compose.

32:31.316 --> 32:35.340
And, you know, I've written songs for Anita Baker and Grover Washington.

32:35.962 --> 32:43.231
And I wrote a big musical called Bobo's that won the American Music Theater Festival's Stephen Sondheim Award.

32:43.372 --> 32:44.193
B-O-B-O-S.

32:45.655 --> 32:49.219
And for that, I got the Stephen Sondheim Award.

32:49.239 --> 32:55.447
And I guess I'm working now on my second album with a singer named Purafe, P-U-R-A-F-E.

32:55.668 --> 32:58.391
He's like a Native American blues singer.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.374
And that's pretty good.

33:00.394 --> 33:05.901
And I started my second book, a novel about a black guy in World War II.

33:06.151 --> 33:09.516
No more non-fiction for a while.

33:09.556 --> 33:14.885
I mean... Did it take a lot out of you?

33:14.985 --> 33:15.686
Oh, man.

33:15.886 --> 33:21.375
I mean, I grew up... I mean, I grew a lot, you know.

33:21.395 --> 33:33.534
The pain, out of that great pain... I can't describe what it's like to have all these, you know, 5,000 years of history just sort of dumped, you know, Jewish history dumped into your lap in the space of a few months.

33:33.554 --> 33:34.335
But...

33:34.771 --> 33:43.162
even though it was painful realizing the kinds of things that she'd gone through, it made me feel just so much... I feel clear, completely free.

33:43.763 --> 33:44.264
You know what I mean?

33:44.324 --> 33:50.272
Knowing, you know, where I come from and where I fit, you know, somehow I've created a niche for myself.

33:51.133 --> 33:53.036
And it's good to know.

33:53.056 --> 33:56.540
I mean, I feel very proud to have, you know, my Jewish background.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.304
It's given me a new lease on life.

33:59.324 --> 34:04.491
It's given me a... It's revived my spirit somehow because it's helped me see a part of myself that I never...

34:05.028 --> 34:07.992
knew existed, but always had an idea that there was something more.

34:08.692 --> 34:10.294
They didn't give us a picture of your mother here.

34:10.314 --> 34:10.955
I wish they had.

34:11.135 --> 34:20.346
Yeah, you know, the only picture in the book of her is when she, you know, she's in the back where she's a baby, and her mother and her brother has a passport picture.

34:20.366 --> 34:25.152
It was one of those decisions where they felt like... Better to have the picture up here.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.634
Yeah, yeah.

34:26.654 --> 34:27.775
Interesting.

34:27.795 --> 34:29.638
Yeah, I mean, you know... Actually, it's interesting.

34:29.718 --> 34:31.660
I'd love to, you know, see her after.

34:31.977 --> 34:38.425
Anything that you really wanted to learn that you didn't, that still remains a mystery for you?

34:39.727 --> 34:44.994
That's a good question.

34:45.014 --> 34:53.545
I'd like to know what it feels like to sit shiva.

34:54.927 --> 34:59.132
I want to know what it feels like to do that, to actually partake in that.

35:00.260 --> 35:05.567
You know, that whole mourning process, whole mourning ritual.

35:06.408 --> 35:14.939
You know, because I just, you know, went through the whole gamut of emotions in terms of discovering mommies.

35:15.299 --> 35:16.781
Is there anything factual about it?

35:17.242 --> 35:19.785
Are you confident that you pretty much know her history?

35:20.025 --> 35:22.909
Oh, yeah, yeah.

35:23.227 --> 35:26.170
I'm sure she's got a secret or two tucked away that I didn't get to.

35:26.250 --> 35:26.831
And it's fine.

35:26.931 --> 35:28.413
And everybody should have a few secrets.

35:28.433 --> 35:33.318
Yeah, I mean, if you give it all away, I mean, what the hell?

35:33.338 --> 35:34.900
And what's her reaction to the book?

35:36.121 --> 35:37.342
Well, she cried when she read it.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.705
Well, she read it and stayed up all night.

35:39.745 --> 35:41.066
She couldn't sleep.

35:41.086 --> 35:42.227
And she cried when she read it.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.510
And afterwards, she told me that she liked it.

35:44.530 --> 35:45.791
And she was proud that I'd done it.

35:46.112 --> 35:48.354
But she only read it one time.

35:48.374 --> 35:49.836
She only read it one time.

35:49.856 --> 35:52.018
Very difficult for her to read about her family.

35:52.471 --> 35:57.077
because she abandoned her mother, basically, and her sister.

35:57.097 --> 36:11.814
And as you say, she hopes that perhaps with this book, there might be a... She's hoping that there's some sort of reconciliation with her sister that... At last, I mean, 30 years ago, 38 years ago, she was living in Cuba in Queens.

36:12.875 --> 36:16.319
Physically, they're not... Physically, they're not that far apart.

36:16.340 --> 36:20.284
There's no telling where the sister could be now, but I have a feeling she's not far away.

36:20.925 --> 36:21.786
I could have found her.

36:21.952 --> 36:23.373
I think she's alive, for sure.

36:23.393 --> 36:24.394
I think she's alive.

36:24.534 --> 36:26.276
I just have a feeling she's alive.

36:26.296 --> 36:30.260
I'm sure I could have tracked her down, but I just feel like she's been through enough.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.181
You know what I mean?

36:31.241 --> 36:34.924
Some things you need to leave alone unless they want to be bothered.

36:34.944 --> 36:39.389
For me, Chris, I've continued to hunt.

36:39.409 --> 36:41.070
That's the kind of reporter I am.

36:41.831 --> 36:48.297
I like to get my closure in some things, one way or the other.

36:49.643 --> 37:12.375
That's the difference between you and I. I wouldn't have minded doing it for myself, but I can imagine that this woman has been through a lot of pain as a young girl because my mother's mother died when her sister was about 14, and her father wasn't worth two cents, really.

37:12.936 --> 37:17.743
So she probably was not even raised by her father after he remarried a Gentile.

37:18.213 --> 37:20.156
So, I mean, she did some heavy suffering.

37:20.736 --> 37:22.679
You know, because I know what it feels like for a parent to die.

37:22.699 --> 37:25.042
My stepfather died when I was 14, and I was crushed.

37:25.603 --> 37:28.086
But at least I had my mother, you know.

37:28.206 --> 37:29.007
Hello.

37:30.830 --> 37:31.691
It's 914-358-8031.

37:32.192 --> 37:36.978
Okay, you want to sign my book for me like that?

37:36.998 --> 37:37.939
No, just tell me briefly.

37:38.420 --> 37:41.464
Your mother must clearly love children to have 12 kids.

37:41.484 --> 37:43.647
Was that important to her to have 12 kids?

37:43.981 --> 37:46.644
Oh, well, she thought that we'd look out for each other when we'd get older.

37:46.885 --> 37:48.527
That was one of the reasons I have so many.

37:49.268 --> 38:00.862
You know, one would look out, and also we could babysit each other, which we did do, while she, you know, while she was at work.

38:00.882 --> 38:03.946
You know, she had this king-queen system where the oldest was the king.

38:04.887 --> 38:09.933
If it was, you know, depending on gender, you were the king or queen, and whoever was younger than you were slaves.

38:11.195 --> 38:12.196
James, give me your address.

38:12.937 --> 38:13.718
It's 118th.

38:14.052 --> 38:15.658
Depot, the EPOT.
