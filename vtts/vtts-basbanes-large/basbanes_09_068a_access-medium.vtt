00:03.237 --> 00:07.783
Parkinson, Joseph Keller, New York.

00:08.844 --> 00:10.886
Let's see if any other interview would start like this.

00:12.508 --> 00:16.573
The interview you did with George Clinton in the Paris Review by 20 years ago.

00:17.474 --> 00:18.295
I'm quoting you.

00:18.315 --> 00:21.379
You said, my novels begin in a strange way.

00:21.659 --> 00:23.902
I don't begin with a theme or even a character.

00:23.982 --> 00:30.730
I begin with a first sentence that is independent of any conscious preparation.

00:31.091 --> 00:32.012
I'm just wondering if

00:32.482 --> 00:35.926
this new novel started in a similar fashion?

00:36.166 --> 00:39.249
I would say probably yes and probably no.

00:40.690 --> 00:51.842
I had, in my mind, the thought had been raised, and I considered doing a sequel to Catchaway 2, but that had been four or five years before this.

00:52.483 --> 00:55.245
I'd finished another novel, and I got a sentence.

00:56.246 --> 01:01.712
And the fact that that sentence did come to me out of wherever my ideas come,

01:02.080 --> 01:06.025
In the case, I must have been thinking about doing it, perhaps unconsciously.

01:06.585 --> 01:09.008
I woke up with this thought.

01:09.829 --> 01:10.830
Now, this has happened before.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.753
I will wake up and things are going well.

01:12.853 --> 01:15.516
I begin writing in my mind before I'm getting out of bed.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.218
And the sentence was this.

01:18.059 --> 01:22.945
In the middle of the second week in the hospital, Josiah began dreaming of his mother.

01:23.245 --> 01:25.908
And he knew again that he was going to die.

01:26.689 --> 01:29.653
Now, I jotted that down on a note.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.754
And then time passed.

01:31.730 --> 01:34.833
And then I had that note, and I finished Picture This.

01:35.434 --> 01:36.956
It was published.

01:36.976 --> 01:42.041
And then I began thinking about the book, about doing a book about Yossarian.

01:42.061 --> 01:46.947
And the second thought that came to me was Yossarian was not going to be 26 or 28 years old.

01:47.027 --> 01:49.390
It was going to be my age.

01:49.410 --> 01:59.661
And the third thought that came to me was the book was going to be as much or more about me than it would be about Yossarian or any of the characters in Catch-22.

02:00.434 --> 02:09.647
And that necessitated my creating other characters who would have parts of my own autobiography as aspects of their own.

02:10.188 --> 02:14.634
And that's the way Closing Time eventually develops.

02:14.654 --> 02:21.844
You mentioned in the Barbara Gell interview on The Times a couple weeks ago, you stressed that this is not an autobiographical novel.

02:22.585 --> 02:26.931
It is not autobiography.

02:28.261 --> 02:48.254
It draws more than any of my works on my own experience, experience as a child in a Jewish family, in a Jewish neighborhood in Tony Island, as a child who went north to the Army quite happily, who had, for the most part, a rather good and beneficial time in the Army, who then went to college under the G.R.

02:48.394 --> 02:53.863
Bill of Rights, and then formulated the ambition to be a writer.

02:54.316 --> 02:59.441
All of that is in closing time, and most of it is in his character, Sam Singer.

02:59.881 --> 03:02.764
Some of the aspects are given to other characters there.

03:04.045 --> 03:18.999
And among my close friends from childhood on was a man named Lou Beckman, who did die of Hodgkin's disease, and I consulted his widow, who's still a good friend, and she gave me input to tales of their courtship and married life.

03:19.019 --> 03:23.783
And another good friend is Marvin Winkler, and I use him by name in the novel.

03:24.100 --> 03:30.168
And he is there more, he's less developed than Lewis or did Sam Singler's.

03:30.188 --> 03:37.417
And I even throw in, sort of, for good measure, a reference to a kid named Joey Heller.

03:37.597 --> 03:38.598
And that is there.

03:39.079 --> 03:46.308
Well, that's there to inform the reader that much of this does come out of actual food.

03:46.408 --> 03:48.831
Is this Joey Heller, the real Joey Heller?

03:48.931 --> 03:53.517
The Joey Heller that's referred to in the book, and he's referred to very scantily,

03:53.902 --> 03:57.327
Again, it was my own past, my own experience.

03:57.607 --> 03:59.549
The Jell-Hell in the book's father died.

03:59.610 --> 04:03.695
His mother was a seamstress and did work for Warby Turning Colors.

04:03.735 --> 04:07.280
That was true of my family, not Sam Singer's family.

04:08.141 --> 04:10.925
He went to work delivering telegrams.

04:11.285 --> 04:15.350
That was true of me also, and he wanted to be a writer, and that was true.

04:15.851 --> 04:21.799
And then the second reference to him, which comes much later from a different category, who says,

04:22.083 --> 04:23.966
Lou is running for people.

04:24.487 --> 04:32.680
He knows all his life, some of them died, some of them were sick, and realized that he's lived much longer than he should have, because Hodgkin's disease.

04:32.700 --> 04:38.629
And among the people, he mentions Joey Howard and the Ambrose Syndrome.

04:38.649 --> 04:39.410
That's me, too.

04:40.952 --> 04:43.016
That's about the extent of me.

04:43.036 --> 04:50.267
On to Sam Singer and on to Osarian, I give very much other elements of my own personal experience.

04:50.686 --> 04:58.396
The decision to not make this area the main event here, tell me a little bit about that.

04:58.416 --> 05:17.942
Well, I don't think we live in an age in which heroes are heroic anymore, and romantic figures are romantic, in which there are causes, rebellious causes, in which there are institutions against, or policies against which people rebel successfully.

05:18.293 --> 05:22.817
We also live in a time when there is no direct threat to us as there is in war.

05:23.738 --> 05:35.449
And to create a figure who would be romantic, who always be quixotic at this time seems to me, would have been out of place or out of place for me.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.590
The mood has changed.

05:36.951 --> 05:48.081
I think the awareness of who we are and where we live and who we live with and what we live with is much different now than it was in the time when Catch-22 was born.

05:49.394 --> 05:53.740
There is great optimism.

05:53.760 --> 05:59.087
There were many conflicts going on in the threat of war continually.

05:59.788 --> 06:01.951
We don't have the threat of war anymore.

06:01.991 --> 06:06.777
We have the possibilities of war, but usually now they're of our own making.

06:07.679 --> 06:16.110
But relate this to the decision... Oh, well, yeah, well, I could not...

06:16.259 --> 06:22.810
Then you go sadly, as a figure he was, because I have to account for what's happened in the past 30 or 40 years.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.975
And what he's done is he's bowed to reality.

06:26.015 --> 06:28.018
I don't go into that to a great extent.

06:28.679 --> 06:39.617
And what the reality of the American experience has been is for people who are educated and married and want family, the reality is we must accept

06:40.205 --> 06:47.735
the conditions in which we live, the social conditions, the economic conditions, and the business conditions.

06:47.755 --> 06:54.064
And I've done it, and Yosari has done it, and in my now, Sam Singer has done it.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.191
And writing the books on Because Yosari and the Time for Ideals is over.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.174
Don't forget your ideals.

07:01.394 --> 07:03.597
We don't have them anymore.

07:06.479 --> 07:18.296
It's also verified by what I take to be the mood and the confusion and indecision of young people coming out of college, and this has been true for 10 or 15 years.

07:19.077 --> 07:26.648
They don't rush out of college with an appetite to get going on work they want to do.

07:27.404 --> 07:29.347
So Sinner was perfect for you.

07:29.367 --> 07:32.292
You had him unnamed in Catch-22, I guess.

07:32.412 --> 07:33.815
No, he's not named in Catch-22.

07:33.835 --> 07:34.716
He's unnamed, I said.

07:34.736 --> 07:35.558
You have him unnamed.

07:35.578 --> 07:35.838
Yeah.

07:36.118 --> 07:39.404
Oh, see, that is part of the technique of constructing a novel.

07:40.025 --> 07:49.361
To tell this novel from different points of view and yet bring it together at some point so they are dealing with common experiences and eventually they'll meet.

07:50.823 --> 07:52.686
And the technique I used was to

07:53.138 --> 07:58.326
Make Sam Singer the tail gunner in that plane on the Mission Pavilion.

07:58.346 --> 07:59.628
That's in Catch-22.

08:00.469 --> 08:05.156
Did you have to go back and reconstruct him in your mind, or do you think he came fully formed?

08:05.556 --> 08:08.280
He's not described at all in Catch-22.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.804
I understand that, but you certainly knew he was there.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.468
You knew you had a tail gunner that you could draw on.

08:13.488 --> 08:22.521
Well, once I decided to use a tail gunner, and I decided to make him represent me or my attitudes and my past,

08:22.973 --> 08:24.114
It was kind of easy.

08:24.154 --> 08:24.755
He's short.

08:25.676 --> 08:26.838
I'm not.

08:26.858 --> 08:29.000
That's irrelevant, really.

08:29.181 --> 08:29.421
Yeah.

08:29.741 --> 08:40.955
No, I had a TA as a tail gunner, and then I'd give him a military pass, which brings him into contact with your servant.

08:41.015 --> 08:42.297
That was not a hard part.

08:44.119 --> 08:48.724
I know you've discussed a bit of this in the Gelties, but that's fine.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.748
It looks perceived like that doesn't exist.

08:52.353 --> 09:05.807
I would certainly, my first question would have been, had she not already asked it, the risk that you faced in writing a sequel to one of the signature novels of the last 65 years.

09:05.827 --> 09:19.761
It was in my mind, and that also, I minimized that risk by creating a different novel, an independent novel, in all respects and style as well, and in content.

09:20.483 --> 09:23.567
And I think I minimized the risk by doing that.

09:23.607 --> 09:35.721
I think the risk would have been grave, and I possibly would have been ashamed of myself, and I would not have done it, would be to just duplicate catchphrase, or emulate, or try to write that same novel about the same people today.

09:36.502 --> 09:44.211
Either they're 45 or 50 years older, or by some scheme, they're not.

09:44.231 --> 09:47.014
And that became impossible, even conceived of doing.

09:47.821 --> 10:03.628
Whereas the idea of writing a novel, drawing on my background, drawing on the background of what we call the American experience for the middle class since World War II, became very stimulating and provoking.

10:03.648 --> 10:07.774
And in that background was the existence of CAT-22.

10:07.915 --> 10:14.065
In the background for me and for much of the reading public, CAT-22 does exist.

10:15.277 --> 10:24.051
I followed that pattern, this pattern in particular, of using other literary characters along with real people.

10:24.612 --> 10:29.420
So, Josarian is a literary character from Catch-22, and we know it.

10:30.262 --> 10:41.520
And then there was a good soldier, Strike, from that book, and Joseph K. from Kafka, and Kat Vonig is in the book, and Truman Capote for Grimms, and then there's Hemingway.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.443
Where does this stuff come from?

10:44.623 --> 10:45.805
I don't know where it comes from.

10:45.845 --> 10:49.489
That's what baffles me and confuses me.

10:49.810 --> 10:54.055
I felt this while doing Catch-22, that ideas would come to me.

10:54.336 --> 10:55.717
I don't know where they came from.

10:56.258 --> 10:58.221
I knew they were good.

10:58.321 --> 10:59.382
I knew they were precious.

11:01.244 --> 11:01.805
And funny.

11:02.566 --> 11:09.415
And yet I knew that they came out of a part of my mind that involves the imagination and a part of my mind they can't control.

11:11.842 --> 11:16.448
We're sitting here on a Sunday afternoon in New York, just for the sake of my tape.

11:17.189 --> 11:21.936
Of course, you must have gotten the TBR earlier in the week, but what a wonderful review that was.

11:22.276 --> 11:24.620
It's a review that makes my week.

11:25.701 --> 11:28.986
It puts me in the most exhilarating frame.

11:29.046 --> 11:31.148
I rushed out this morning.

11:31.189 --> 11:33.412
I said, I'm just guessing that they're going to leave.

11:33.672 --> 11:34.313
I'm just a guess.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.637
I was going to get my times when I came to New York.

11:37.717 --> 11:41.022
I said, no, I bet you'll leave with the review and their advice.

11:41.795 --> 11:44.357
And I said, .

11:44.377 --> 11:48.961
Well, I do, too.

11:48.981 --> 11:55.226
I said, a review to, I mean, I know novelists, writers, they say they don't even read them.

11:55.947 --> 11:58.109
No, you read Baloney, isn't it?

11:58.129 --> 11:58.789
No, I read reviews.

11:59.110 --> 12:02.853
I try to avoid seeing bad reviews, but there's always some good.

12:02.873 --> 12:03.834
You're going to get them, I mean.

12:03.854 --> 12:09.378
No, there's always some good friend who brings my attention, you know.

12:09.478 --> 12:09.919
That's right.

12:09.939 --> 12:11.380
Yeah, but this review is, uh,

12:12.457 --> 12:16.789
It pretty much nullifies the effect, the emotional effects of anything that follows.

12:17.592 --> 12:20.059
A page one review.

12:20.119 --> 12:21.041
A page one review.

12:21.061 --> 12:22.365
And the man clearly read it.

12:22.632 --> 12:26.055
And he said he wasn't disposed much to catch 22.

12:26.255 --> 12:28.737
And he said, this is great.

12:28.757 --> 12:29.818
I like this.

12:29.979 --> 12:34.703
It puts me in terrific frame on tomorrow there's a publishing party.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.806
And that's been scheduled a month or so ago, or two months ago.

12:39.147 --> 12:47.494
And I could not help thinking what kind of party it would be if the Review and the Times had been a negative entree of one.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.676
So I feel I've been blessed.

12:50.076 --> 12:51.998
Well, and the author's

12:52.332 --> 12:54.715
introduction to the new edition of Catch-22.

12:55.155 --> 13:03.004
You talk again about reviews and how they even get into the life of the book, and perhaps even, you know, the fortunes of the book.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.045
Well, they do.

13:04.125 --> 13:20.803
Getting back to the element of risk, it was almost certainty that my doing a book that would be called or could be called a sequel to Catch-Rack 2 would command a lot of attention, a lot of publicity, and that there would be a

13:21.256 --> 13:24.643
a decent sale for the book, regardless of you.

13:24.663 --> 13:36.928
So the risk of, it wasn't always in my mind, the risk of being cute, used to being cheap, was kind of compensated by it.

13:37.048 --> 13:37.830
Used to being cheap.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.245
In what respect?

13:39.465 --> 13:42.189
Well, if I... Yeah, yeah.

13:42.749 --> 13:45.192
Catching in on Catcher 2 and adding nothing to it.

13:45.212 --> 13:46.854
Catcher 2 is yours, though, I mean.

13:47.054 --> 13:54.783
Yeah, but, you know, I consider that woman writing a sequel from here to... Yeah, but I'm not that woman.

13:54.884 --> 13:56.686
I think I'm saying that's him.

13:56.866 --> 14:00.971
I'm a novelist, and I take my work very seriously.

14:01.011 --> 14:04.775
I haven't done a book that took less than four years of my time.

14:05.696 --> 14:07.058
It's very hard work for me.

14:07.544 --> 14:25.145
And if I suddenly did a book that was not hard work and that showed it, then I would feel I was not acting in good faith and not in a way consistent with my own ethical views and my own regard to fiction.

14:25.205 --> 14:26.266
Has there ever been a poem?

14:26.286 --> 14:28.129
Do you have unfinished novels in the drawer?

14:28.149 --> 14:28.489
No.

14:28.638 --> 14:31.481
I mean, so there's no point of no return for you.

14:31.521 --> 14:35.386
You don't say this, you've never, I never would have heard you that this isn't working.

14:35.406 --> 14:42.054
No, I don't, I don't really start a book or go very fondly without knowing where it's going.

14:42.394 --> 14:57.632
With this book and with all my other books, I had the ending in mind when it began, but also I would do conscientiously, when I talk about a first draft, there's no such thing, everything is rewritten.

14:57.983 --> 15:11.279
I would do 150, 200 pages before I would begin to understand what the book is really about, envision its size, envision the relative importance of the characters and the different themes in it.

15:11.299 --> 15:21.332
And with this book, I think I did that two or three times, just even getting the arrangements of the chapters, you know, what chapter was to follow which.

15:22.133 --> 15:25.577
At the beginning, there was a chapter...

15:25.743 --> 15:29.909
The first chapter, Introducing Your Sound, was about 60 or 70 pages.

15:29.929 --> 15:36.319
I knew it was too long, so then I had to find some way of providing it and find something to put in between it.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.303
And it took time, and then I redid it.

15:40.024 --> 15:50.940
And it's advantageous, and there was an advantage to it also, because one of the things it told me was how to indicate a passage of time.

15:51.393 --> 15:56.200
None of my books do I keep a calendar sequence.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.184
I don't even know what seasons it is.

15:59.625 --> 16:10.120
And then I realized by taking a chapter of your Saturday and then putting a chapter about Samuel or the post-total, that in itself indicates the passage of time.

16:10.140 --> 16:13.545
So when I got back to your Saturday, I could change the season.

16:13.565 --> 16:20.235
And without even specifying how many weeks have elapsed since the first chapter, the time was passing.

16:21.008 --> 16:24.234
It was important for you to age Yossarian in real time.

16:25.175 --> 16:26.978
In the book or before?

16:27.038 --> 16:27.920
In the book.

16:27.940 --> 16:34.191
Well, it was important for you to have a year or two pass because the events required.

16:34.752 --> 16:39.099
Well, I mean from the events of Catch-22 and bringing him forward in real time.

16:39.119 --> 16:39.700
Oh, yes, of course.

16:40.121 --> 16:42.004
I mean, there are...

16:42.490 --> 16:45.434
fictional characters of age at all, as we all know.

16:45.574 --> 16:50.641
No, it was very important for me to deal with him and myself.

16:50.741 --> 16:54.687
In all my books, even God knows, I'm dealing with the present.

16:54.707 --> 17:05.381
I'm dealing with not my own personal experience, but the experience I have as one of the general population and a generation.

17:05.401 --> 17:08.646
How has the world affected me?

17:08.666 --> 17:10.168
How does it look to the rest of us?

17:10.722 --> 17:14.145
That's true in all my novels.

17:16.027 --> 17:19.429
Experience.

17:19.470 --> 17:23.893
The common experience is very much the substance of all my novels.

17:25.114 --> 17:26.516
Once again, the common experience?

17:26.776 --> 17:31.760
Yeah, the common experience we share is very much the substance of all my novels.

17:32.060 --> 17:39.767
You know, in that same 1974 interview I began this interview with, you said then that you weren't much

17:39.967 --> 17:43.290
You didn't consider yourself a very good descriptive writer.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.132
And I think that you've overcome that.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.373
I've overcome it.

17:46.393 --> 17:51.578
Well, the funny part is... Description to the bus terminal is... Oh, yes.

17:51.598 --> 17:56.222
But description is... By description, I mean description.

17:56.343 --> 18:07.273
I mean knowing what color this couch is, and knowing whether that wood is walnut or oak, and how you describe the metal under this table.

18:07.507 --> 18:10.150
I'm lost when it comes to things like that.

18:10.270 --> 18:18.678
I'm in awe of people like John Updike, with their command of these phrases and their knowledge of material things.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.660
That's what I meant by that.

18:20.680 --> 18:33.312
But when I re-read Catch-22 in preparation for Closing Time, I was bedazzled by my vocabulary, my descriptive vocabulary in Catch-22.

18:33.646 --> 18:40.934
And when it came to things like describing trees or leaves or the sky or wind, I thought I had not written on it.

18:40.954 --> 18:44.959
I thought I was reading a book by a much better writer than I am.

18:45.199 --> 18:45.560
Come on.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.661
No, seriously.

18:46.681 --> 18:48.803
How long has it been since you read it?

18:48.823 --> 18:49.905
Oh, a long time.

18:49.925 --> 18:50.626
Very long.

18:50.646 --> 18:51.707
Yeah, maybe 2020.

18:51.747 --> 18:52.267
No kidding.

18:52.287 --> 18:53.409
Yeah.

18:53.429 --> 18:57.453
And I was so surprised to find words and phrases.

18:57.493 --> 18:58.875
Hey, this guy's pretty good.

18:58.895 --> 18:59.235
Yeah.

18:59.256 --> 19:03.180
It's like reading Evelyn Waller, reading a description by Charles Dickinson.

19:03.548 --> 19:11.558
They were not my vocabulary, my literary vocabulary.

19:11.578 --> 19:13.600
I must have spent so much time with O.J.

19:13.681 --> 19:15.543
to service.

19:15.563 --> 19:18.346
Maybe that, but you said you're a tireless rewriter.

19:18.506 --> 19:19.187
Yeah, yeah.

19:19.307 --> 19:21.971
Now, do you use a computer, or is it still...?

19:21.991 --> 19:29.700
Well, it's still longhand, but from longhand I go to a computer, whereas in the past, from longhand I go to a typewriter.

19:29.720 --> 19:33.505
Rewriting is my book for longhand on the typewriter.

19:33.755 --> 19:36.159
Now I rewrite on the computer.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.343
I like that part very much.

19:38.363 --> 19:40.326
The rewriting is very good.

19:40.707 --> 19:42.189
It's very much easier typing.

19:42.670 --> 19:44.954
You still write ideas down in 3x5 cards?

19:44.974 --> 19:45.174
Yeah.

19:45.374 --> 19:45.695
Oh, sure.

19:45.715 --> 19:48.980
That's where I found that Yosarian sentence.

19:49.201 --> 19:58.436
And that must have been put down before I had finished the picture of this, because I found it in the cabinet of cards with the picture of this.

19:58.456 --> 19:59.678
At one point, I might have

20:00.755 --> 20:10.669
I can't see I would have thought of using it and picture this, but I had no other place to put it, so I put it in that small cabinet.

20:10.729 --> 20:17.698
Was writing a sequel to Catch-22 something that generated entirely within yourself?

20:17.798 --> 20:24.428
I'm sure people have constantly asked you, what happened to these people?

20:24.528 --> 20:26.931
It was my own decision to go ahead and it's the same.

20:27.502 --> 20:30.005
The factors are the same as the Catch-22.

20:30.106 --> 20:37.556
I was looking for an idea for a novel, a subject for a new novel, and the best subject that came to me was this book Closing Time.

20:39.298 --> 20:42.863
The fact that it was a sequel is prolific in the intention.

20:42.883 --> 20:49.012
What happened is I saw it as a chance to do a very, very good book, a meaningful book.

20:50.093 --> 20:53.458
Uh-oh.

20:54.012 --> 21:01.987
about things I feel and about things we experience about our world today and the individual world.

21:02.207 --> 21:10.663
The fact that the people who were in World War II, people are nearing the end of their lives.

21:11.985 --> 21:15.632
How did you feel when you were watching this D-Day stuff?

21:16.102 --> 21:19.386
I felt it, but I thought I was reading my book.

21:19.426 --> 21:19.947
Here's the book.

21:20.007 --> 21:22.250
I mean, I've just written this, and I'm looking at it now.

21:22.571 --> 21:23.792
And these are the survivors.

21:23.832 --> 21:27.698
These are the ones that don't look like soldiers.

21:27.778 --> 21:28.098
No.

21:28.258 --> 21:32.704
Well, I have that the very first pages of closing time.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.866
That's how the book starts.

21:33.886 --> 21:34.106
What?

21:34.246 --> 21:35.588
That's how the book starts.

21:35.608 --> 21:39.153
Yeah, but people my age talked about wars, not Vietnam.

21:39.453 --> 21:42.818
One of the wars started almost half a century ago.

21:43.304 --> 21:45.828
How's that your experience in that war?

21:45.848 --> 21:48.072
I mean, I'm a Vietnam War guy myself.

21:48.793 --> 21:51.498
My war, the event of my generation was that war.

21:52.620 --> 21:57.809
And it happens that I've interviewed a couple of people recently, like Tobias Wolff, I did for Publishers Weekly.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.732
They've interviewed for Publishers Weekly now, too.

22:00.794 --> 22:02.357
And Tim O'Brien, who's life.

22:02.657 --> 22:04.941
Yeah.

22:05.360 --> 22:12.032
World War II has, I guess, affected your life in ways that... Well, it's in closing time.

22:12.052 --> 22:20.446
Sam Singer says it more than once, and Josiah says it, that World War II was a blessing for them.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.370
It could have changed their lives.

22:22.931 --> 22:24.193
It enriched them.

22:24.213 --> 22:29.342
As Sam Singer says, the day he went to the army, he was earning more money than anything as a power quake.

22:30.436 --> 22:36.302
It was a very good experience for those of us who were not wounded and not killed and didn't go crazy.

22:37.563 --> 22:40.587
And I think even Vonnegut might say the same way.

22:40.607 --> 22:45.932
I mean, he was more in combat than he was taken prisoner.

22:45.952 --> 22:47.234
You have him in the book, too.

22:47.254 --> 22:54.021
But yeah, and the reason is, again, to let people out in the fictional work.

22:54.321 --> 23:00.207
The fictional work is rooted in reality.

23:00.743 --> 23:12.118
See, he gave me information about being a POW, taking prison in the bulge, and how he got to prison camp, and how he got to prison camp to Dresden.

23:12.939 --> 23:24.513
And I felt, well, since I wanted to use it, if I use it without attributing it to him, people who know Slaughterhouse-Five and know his essays will know that I've been talking about it.

23:24.534 --> 23:29.620
So I might as well put him right back in the POW camp, and put him in Dresden.

23:30.005 --> 23:33.029
with this other category, Lewa Minowich.

23:33.049 --> 23:44.144
I was astonished to read, and I can only compare it to one other example, but you haven't been into the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

23:44.284 --> 23:48.349
This is entirely second-hand, basically second-hand information.

23:48.369 --> 23:50.812
It is second-hand information.

23:50.933 --> 23:55.118
It came from news report reports, and Newsweek did a piece of the report.

23:55.638 --> 24:06.972
A New Jersey newspaper did a piece on the bus tunnel, and I began clipping these stories from them.

24:07.533 --> 24:14.682
Then I did find this wonderful researcher whom I'd never met, but he was in New Jersey and coming here.

24:15.242 --> 24:17.806
About two or three people have interviewed him, by the way.

24:18.286 --> 24:20.469
They all commute to New Jersey.

24:23.112 --> 24:24.514
I got through a bus tunnel.

24:24.832 --> 24:30.101
And I told him one day to spend about two or three hours and just walk around telling me what you see.

24:30.121 --> 24:34.107
So I put together his observations with reports and papers.

24:36.231 --> 24:38.194
For me, I'd probably want to go and see it myself.

24:38.595 --> 24:40.518
Why would you personally not want to go?

24:40.859 --> 24:46.588
If I were here in New York City, I would do it, but it's a three-hour trip for me to get here.

24:46.608 --> 24:50.755
And if I felt I needed more, I would have done it.

24:50.903 --> 24:57.349
When I interviewed Tom Wolfe the first time in his book The White Stuff, I spent three years on an aircraft carrier.

24:58.310 --> 25:00.311
And he had that aircraft carrier down.

25:00.532 --> 25:01.973
He says, I've never even seen one.

25:01.993 --> 25:03.775
I mean, he called people and they told him.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.696
I said, well, could we do it?

25:06.397 --> 25:12.102
I think that's part of the talent of a writer, fiction or non-fiction.

25:14.044 --> 25:17.207
No writer describes every detail of everything physical.

25:17.247 --> 25:20.910
They never describe every detail of a face or something.

25:21.430 --> 25:26.676
or even a pair of shoes, let's say, or, let's say, red shoes, or that woman's wearing red shoes.

25:27.457 --> 25:45.560
I think the path of the writer, I don't know how he gets it, but just develops instinctively, is to give a few of those details which enable the reader to see the whole thing, and I believe Tom Wolf certainly has it, and I think I have it with the best terminal.

25:46.141 --> 25:48.443
It's wonderful.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.526
I take all these notes of the books here,

25:50.843 --> 25:55.690
find out, you know, when you get to do the interview, you look it up, look it up.

25:55.710 --> 25:56.812
I enjoyed it so much.

25:56.892 --> 26:12.536
I have to tell you when I interviewed John Irving last month, and this is a question for you at some point, but he is so identified with the world according to Garb that people tend to measure everything that he does against that novel.

26:12.616 --> 26:18.825
And of course, your name, in fact, that was the day I was there, was the day that the Galpies came out.

26:19.548 --> 26:22.392
And he said, you know, well, look at Joe Heller.

26:22.452 --> 26:25.757
He said, I personally, he said, something happened to me.

26:26.298 --> 26:32.226
He enjoyed it so much more than Catch-22, not to take anything away from it.

26:32.246 --> 26:34.129
Yeah, very many people tell me that now.

26:34.149 --> 26:35.150
And John Irving said that.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.754
And he said, use that in your piece, because I just feel that way.

26:37.814 --> 26:44.644
And he said, but these critics, these reviewers keep insisting on saying, well,

26:44.962 --> 26:46.544
It's back since Catch-22.

26:46.624 --> 26:49.067
I mean, it's hard, especially in your case.

26:49.888 --> 26:51.410
That was his fifth book.

26:51.851 --> 26:53.273
Catch-22 was your first.

26:53.473 --> 26:54.855
But I'm sorry, you're about to say something.

26:54.915 --> 27:00.963
Yeah, I was going to say it does not bother me, being identified.

27:01.123 --> 27:10.195
No, it's good to know that there is that book back there, that almost everybody holds an highest name, even the Review and the States Times.

27:10.215 --> 27:11.577
He doesn't despise the book.

27:12.080 --> 27:17.829
just that he's a person who does not think as much of it as other people do.

27:17.849 --> 27:19.091
He doesn't denigrate it.

27:19.451 --> 27:26.442
And I think his descriptions of Catch-22 are fairly accurate.

27:26.462 --> 27:34.815
And I think Closing Time is a much broader book and deals with many more ideas than Catch-22 in a different way.

27:36.257 --> 27:40.163
I'm not offended if he says he thinks it's a better book than Catch-22.

27:41.122 --> 27:44.527
It's a more mature book, and it was more difficult to write.

27:45.328 --> 28:01.471
The interesting thing for me is each year, or each two years, when people talk to me, in the course of interviews, more and more will tell me how much they've been impressed by something happened, how deeply affected they are by it.

28:02.091 --> 28:05.957
And it was a much more difficult book to do successfully, you know, than catchphrase.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.399
Well, you know that.

28:07.459 --> 28:08.260
There's no fit.

28:08.375 --> 28:13.100
There's very little fiscal action in it, and very little comedy.

28:13.140 --> 28:16.563
It is interesting that Irving jumped right out of that.

28:16.583 --> 28:20.086
When it was something happened, he said that book.

28:20.887 --> 28:24.110
In my view, he said that book's his masterpiece.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.453
Well, that's quite a good point.

28:26.473 --> 28:31.678
If you try to complement, but knowing John's work so well, I can understand why.

28:31.718 --> 28:37.183
He has such a strong attachment for children.

28:37.788 --> 28:48.286
There's a man who has such strong attachments, and so strong attachments to all his children, they become ambivalent and contentious, and he can't figure them out.

28:48.706 --> 28:50.229
I can understand Jones.

28:50.910 --> 28:54.396
I remember when I was at Bill Kennedy's house outside of Albany,

28:54.967 --> 28:57.891
And that day, the proof came in for good as gold.

28:57.911 --> 28:59.973
And he said, oh, I can't wait there.

28:59.993 --> 29:01.175
Oh, really?

29:01.195 --> 29:01.295
Yeah.

29:01.315 --> 29:01.716
He knew about it.

29:01.736 --> 29:05.020
Yeah, well, I guess that they were, what, setting it?

29:05.080 --> 29:05.320
Yeah.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.944
Well, he reviewed something happening in the public.

29:07.964 --> 29:08.384
That's right.

29:08.524 --> 29:08.885
Yeah.

29:08.905 --> 29:10.347
And David was an extraordinary guy.

29:10.367 --> 29:10.988
He's one of them.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.770
I think he's a wonderful writer.

29:12.830 --> 29:15.133
He's a wonderful writer, one of the most generous people.

29:15.333 --> 29:15.794
Very nice.

29:15.994 --> 29:16.755
Very nice guy.

29:17.697 --> 29:19.760
Ah, okay, let me look at my notes here.

29:20.341 --> 29:26.572
He and Irwin Shaw, among novels, impressed me of having the most generous words imaginable.

29:26.592 --> 29:28.095
To another writer.

29:28.115 --> 29:31.300
He and who else?

29:32.562 --> 29:33.724
I loved his stuff.

29:34.385 --> 29:38.372
Well, Irwin Shaw found me before I was published, and so on.

29:39.095 --> 29:41.498
With Mark Buckworth, sent a telegraph.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.199
Oh, really?

29:42.299 --> 29:44.021
I don't know.

29:44.181 --> 29:45.904
Oh, there was a well-known telegraph.

29:45.924 --> 29:47.345
A telegram that came.

29:47.365 --> 29:50.069
It was in the first dance of Catch-the-Roy-Toon.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.150
It's since we've been created.

29:51.631 --> 29:54.995
And it's from Mark Buckworth, who's got the company at Galleys.

29:56.016 --> 29:59.761
And he said, I think, congratulate Joseph.

29:59.781 --> 30:01.383
You've got a lot of money now, by the way.

30:01.403 --> 30:02.164
What, the telegraph?

30:02.184 --> 30:02.725
The Galleys.

30:03.286 --> 30:04.187
Yeah.

30:04.587 --> 30:06.790
I saw him go for a thousand bucks for the book for you.

30:07.057 --> 30:15.167
What he said was, I think it's a masterpiece, and Irwin Shaw and Joseph Heller agree, and then Irwin Shaw sent his own letter.

30:16.149 --> 30:21.075
I love that line, Nazarian Lives, John Chancellor.

30:21.475 --> 30:23.158
He, to me, is a class guy, too.

30:23.298 --> 30:23.898
Oh, sure.

30:24.119 --> 30:25.921
That helped everything else.

30:25.981 --> 30:29.966
He was there, and he gave me my first television interview.

30:30.066 --> 30:34.532
I think it was in August or September, a year after publication.

30:35.052 --> 30:40.417
And the facts in the Fefter Catch-22 are pretty much true.

30:40.437 --> 30:42.959
He had been their Kremlin reporter.

30:42.979 --> 30:47.884
They brought him back, and they needed somebody to head the Today Show, which he didn't want to do.

30:48.244 --> 30:49.445
He was a newsman.

30:49.625 --> 30:50.986
He was a newsman.

30:51.327 --> 30:57.412
And what he said was he would do, but he didn't want to make jokes about monkeys or clowns or freaks.

30:57.552 --> 30:59.754
He himself would take it.

30:59.774 --> 31:02.697
He himself could interview only the people he wanted to.

31:03.368 --> 31:06.413
But then he shows you Yosarian limbs, the sticker.

31:06.533 --> 31:07.214
Oh, yeah.

31:07.234 --> 31:09.037
And that was in that bar down the street.

31:09.057 --> 31:11.541
We were so drunk by 11 o'clock to 12 o'clock.

31:11.801 --> 31:12.523
Those are the days.

31:12.703 --> 31:13.765
You can't do it anymore.

31:13.785 --> 31:17.611
I don't drink in the afternoons anymore.

31:18.732 --> 31:19.894
It killed the day.

31:20.756 --> 31:23.520
Back then, I didn't mind if it killed the day.

31:23.787 --> 31:27.612
When I was working at Time Magazine, nobody worked in the afternoons anyway.

31:27.632 --> 31:28.393
They were all drunk.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.735
You mentioned Erwin Schock.

31:29.815 --> 31:36.023
I remember he was interviewed years ago on, I forget whose show it was, you know, what's a good day, what's a bad day.

31:36.043 --> 31:37.525
So you get up and you start to drop.

31:38.366 --> 31:42.391
And then you go out and you might have a drink and you come back and say, the hell of it.

31:47.177 --> 31:50.341
Do you, when you're writing, do you put quotas on yourself?

31:50.421 --> 31:51.803
I mean, do you have...

31:52.070 --> 31:55.594
I want to do three handwritten pages a day.

31:56.354 --> 32:01.079
And my day is dedicated to a morning session.

32:01.179 --> 32:04.362
Now, for me, morning is not what it is for real working man.

32:04.863 --> 32:09.027
Probably I start working between 10 and 10.30 after breakfast.

32:09.047 --> 32:17.716
And by 11.30 or 12.01, I usually have my three handwritten pages, which is the equivalent of one handwritten page with the pairs I used.

32:18.677 --> 32:22.060
And since I moved out in East Hampton and had fewer diversions,

32:22.462 --> 32:25.807
I generally will do four or five pendant pages in the morning.

32:26.628 --> 32:28.611
Once that's done, I feel okay.

32:28.631 --> 32:29.712
I've done my day's work.

32:30.313 --> 32:42.089
Usually, if nothing distracts me in the afternoon or the evening, I will go back and do more, usually beginning by rewriting the last page I've done, even if I don't intend to change it.

32:42.109 --> 32:49.920
It's like just getting into the neurotic pattern of writing.

32:50.322 --> 32:52.866
I think I would always write on a typewriter.

32:53.026 --> 32:56.731
I have the impression that most fictional artists they write in the long end.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.594
But that's my quote.

32:58.754 --> 32:59.415
And that's what he said.

32:59.435 --> 33:02.560
He bangs out on the typewriter, I guess.

33:02.640 --> 33:07.407
And you said you had this whole thing in shape before you actually started writing it.

33:08.128 --> 33:13.956
You had that climactic scene, that scene at the end, not that scene, but that long sequence at the end.

33:14.357 --> 33:17.882
You had that all... No, I didn't have the details of that.

33:18.301 --> 33:20.884
That is pretty extraordinary.

33:20.904 --> 33:21.765
Oh, yeah.

33:21.966 --> 33:29.775
I'm so proud of that because I wonder... Well, I wonder if the story's about 16 or 17 characters.

33:30.356 --> 33:37.866
If I had not dealt with them, then it really would feel that the book was incomplete, or would have good reason to complain.

33:37.886 --> 33:39.027
What happened to...

33:39.445 --> 33:43.950
What happened to this person?

33:44.091 --> 33:50.138
What happened to the chapel?

33:50.579 --> 34:00.210
I should have said so beautifully.

34:00.230 --> 34:01.412
But you hit these things.

34:01.852 --> 34:03.955
I mean, do you laugh?

34:03.975 --> 34:05.757
I don't have to laugh.

34:06.142 --> 34:08.425
I know it's funny, but I'm laughing.

34:08.445 --> 34:21.722
When I laugh at my work is when I read a section that I haven't looked at for a few months, or when I read, we read Catch 22, and some of it just pops right out with complete surprise.

34:21.782 --> 34:25.767
I'd forgotten what was there, and then I would laugh.

34:26.929 --> 34:28.130
Oh, very much, yes.

34:29.672 --> 34:32.716
So it's a pretty good, you were a slow writer.

34:33.017 --> 34:33.297
Yeah.

34:33.985 --> 34:35.366
What is it now?

34:35.566 --> 34:36.407
Six or seven novels?

34:36.527 --> 34:37.969
I forget.

34:37.989 --> 34:39.030
I think it's five now.

34:39.410 --> 34:39.971
Maybe six.

34:40.251 --> 34:41.932
But I look at it this way.

34:42.072 --> 34:53.583
It's like trying to understand the world of subatomic physics or astrological physics.

34:55.525 --> 35:02.271
Between 1982 and 1984, I've written and published, God knows,

35:02.943 --> 35:08.210
No working matter, picture this, and closing time.

35:08.230 --> 35:09.372
It's five works.

35:09.612 --> 35:12.977
Again, it's in 12 years, so I can't be that small.

35:13.657 --> 35:18.624
But I was halfway through, a third-way through, God knows, but it's still a lot.

35:18.744 --> 35:21.989
But you're actually, you're getting faster this year.

35:22.009 --> 35:23.751
No, I'm not fast.

35:23.771 --> 35:29.479
You see, picture this was quite normally between three and four years, as good as gold was between three and four years.

35:29.539 --> 35:32.663
God knows what it would have been if I hadn't lost a year with the illness.

35:32.761 --> 35:34.848
This is between five and six years.

35:35.650 --> 35:36.954
So I don't think I'm getting pissed.

35:36.994 --> 35:40.425
I think what I am doing is I tend to work every day now.

35:41.529 --> 35:45.100
I wouldn't do it if I lived in New York because there'd be too many distractions.

35:45.451 --> 35:46.572
welcome distractions.

35:46.592 --> 35:47.474
I would make them.

35:47.494 --> 35:47.774
Sure.

35:48.054 --> 35:53.381
If people wouldn't call me up to say, let's go have a coffee now, a drink, I would call them up.

35:53.882 --> 35:56.425
And in this mix, of course, you mentioned No Laughing Matter.

35:56.565 --> 35:58.067
That's a work of non-fiction.

35:58.087 --> 35:58.648
Yes.

35:58.668 --> 36:00.910
And that was something you wrote with a friend.

36:00.950 --> 36:01.231
Yes.

36:01.671 --> 36:03.394
Yes, Reed Vogel.

36:03.474 --> 36:05.376
How was that as a challenge for you?

36:05.396 --> 36:09.061
I mean, you said in that 74 interview that you could never be a journalist.

36:09.081 --> 36:10.082
Yeah.

36:10.102 --> 36:14.968
Well, I can write non-fiction only if it's...

36:15.573 --> 36:19.679
personally, a personal reminiscence.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.882
I've done a few articles far back.

36:21.922 --> 36:29.413
The only ones that I could do, there's no journalistic articles, no truly informative articles.

36:29.733 --> 36:33.659
They all deal with something personal, and they tend to be humorous.

36:34.460 --> 36:39.988
A couple in the past that are very funny, not my movie writing experiences, but they're very far back.

36:41.410 --> 36:44.955
I wouldn't even undertake to write a straightforward account or something.

36:45.188 --> 36:59.910
Now, what made No Rapping Matter easier for me was the pattern of he and I doing all of the chapters and making comments about each other, so I was able to describe the experience of being almost totally paralyzed and recovered.

36:59.930 --> 37:01.412
What an experience that is.

37:01.532 --> 37:02.213
It's awful.

37:02.233 --> 37:03.996
It's an awful disease.

37:04.016 --> 37:05.257
I've never heard of it before.

37:05.317 --> 37:09.103
I hadn't either, but that's what helped save me.

37:09.607 --> 37:13.092
I mean, I didn't think I was going to be paralyzed.

37:13.112 --> 37:19.040
I mean, on the first examination, it was on a Sunday in the doctor's office.

37:19.060 --> 37:26.330
The doctor was a friend, and he called a neurologist, and they came over, and I said, you're going to get a little back.

37:26.991 --> 37:28.774
And I said, okay.

37:29.335 --> 37:33.621
I would not let it register that he was saying I was going to lose things.

37:33.641 --> 37:38.888
He gave me various muscle tests, he saw them, and so I was losing strength.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.946
I am more troubled by that disease now than I was when I was having it.

37:45.148 --> 37:50.555
Just the other day, I got a letter from a man in California who said that a friend of his is Toby Powell.

37:50.575 --> 37:52.317
I just got it.

37:52.337 --> 37:54.921
But I go visit him when I got to San Francisco.

37:55.401 --> 37:57.484
He said that the drive would be three hours.

37:58.465 --> 38:00.849
And I said, I won't have three hours.

38:02.631 --> 38:07.137
Knowing my schedule, if you were in San Francisco, I definitely would, but I would drive him a letter.

38:07.758 --> 38:09.640
And I wrote a letter.

38:10.261 --> 38:15.708
And in writing a letter about that disease now, it was more terrifying.

38:15.788 --> 38:17.350
But why is it more troubling to you?

38:17.611 --> 38:17.811
What?

38:17.831 --> 38:19.213
Why is it more troubling to you?

38:19.253 --> 38:20.755
Because I know the disease now.

38:21.115 --> 38:23.298
And when I had it, I didn't understand it.

38:23.318 --> 38:27.043
I didn't understand that I could be permanently paralyzed.

38:27.183 --> 38:29.046
Almost all my muscles are weak now.

38:29.066 --> 38:36.415
You'll say you didn't notice it, but if we talk long enough, it's only walking up steps, or if we were eating.

38:36.918 --> 38:39.901
muscles and my chewing and swelling are very weak.

38:40.422 --> 38:44.506
I can't clear food off my tongue to answer if you ask me a question.

38:44.566 --> 38:47.950
I'd have to spit food at you.

38:47.970 --> 38:50.693
So it's not a 100% recovery for me?

38:50.793 --> 38:51.274
No, not for me.

38:51.654 --> 38:58.562
The man in the book that Sam Singh was going to see at the end is a man who actually is alive and lives in Sydney.

38:58.582 --> 39:00.524
His name is Ed Boyle.

39:00.584 --> 39:04.208
He got the disease at 28 years old.

39:04.728 --> 39:08.794
At the time, it has been a wonderful company, so they kept them on.

39:08.814 --> 39:15.365
They may have had a specific operation, international operation, but he's retired now.

39:15.545 --> 39:18.229
He also always must have been hit now.

39:18.249 --> 39:22.896
You know, when I had the disease, I had not met him.

39:23.137 --> 39:28.084
I had not, even though we had them in the same company, I met him for friends.

39:28.605 --> 39:31.630
Friends I'd worked at the time, said, you know, Ed Bonin and George.

39:31.846 --> 39:46.124
But it is interesting where, as Gilbert again points this out in her piece, that disease is a concern that has repeated itself throughout your work, but you then should experience such a frightful disease yourself.

39:46.144 --> 39:49.729
Oh, it's a frightful disease, but it tells me of my friends.

39:49.829 --> 39:54.996
I've been very, very lucky in that health.

39:55.857 --> 39:59.121
But it is a concern in your work, though.

39:59.181 --> 40:00.823
What disease is, yes, yes.

40:00.955 --> 40:08.207
And at this age, the surprising thing is I worry less about it now than I did before I had the disease.

40:08.227 --> 40:16.561
Now, I don't know whether disease is responsible for it or whether it's a resignation, a realization that by age people are going to get sick.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.705
And so later I will do it.

40:18.725 --> 40:24.274
Now, it's less frightening to me now, the idea of disease.

40:24.294 --> 40:26.237
Mutilation, surgery is still kind of frightening the idea.

40:26.858 --> 40:31.505
What's that again?

40:31.525 --> 40:35.030
The idea of mutilation.

40:35.050 --> 40:35.210
Surgery.

40:35.431 --> 40:41.620
I remember doing an interview with Will Bezal years ago after he had said a novel in ancient Greece or whatever it was.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.023
And I said, I almost get the feeling you'd like to live then.

40:44.611 --> 40:48.796
No, I'd never want to live at a time when there was no anesthetic.

40:48.956 --> 40:52.240
And, you know, think about it, I guess.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.923
But no, I'll just assume I live now and the medicine is better.

40:55.964 --> 40:57.426
I won't take up too much of your time.

40:57.626 --> 41:02.973
I know they said an hour, but I think we really should talk about the central concern.

41:02.993 --> 41:09.220
There are so many concerns in the novel and themes, and I'm not going to have to be addressing the novel explaining them quite well.

41:10.141 --> 41:13.285
But you really did want to do something about a summing up about

41:13.754 --> 41:17.640
the awareness of Papa Diem, I guess, time passing.

41:17.700 --> 41:22.588
That's not Papa Diem.

41:22.608 --> 41:29.198
Papa Diem would make the most sense of all of the day, but it's a safe thing, isn't it?

41:30.600 --> 41:32.102
That's not in those times.

41:32.122 --> 41:36.329
The fact that time is passing and things are coming to an end is.

41:37.230 --> 41:41.196
Nobody uses that as a justification for

41:42.408 --> 41:44.170
for doing something they would not do.

41:44.670 --> 41:48.473
There's a remarkable interview of Steven Potter on television.

41:48.553 --> 41:51.015
I don't know if he's through or not.

41:51.035 --> 41:55.059
He knew he was going to be dead in nine days or weeks from cancer.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.362
And he's very articulate.

41:58.382 --> 42:03.947
And one thing, he said, well, you have a very nice to do things without something inconsistency.

42:03.967 --> 42:09.591
And one of the things I think I'd like to do is shoot a little bit of money.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.453
Shoot a little bit of money.

42:11.770 --> 42:14.293
That is funny, isn't it?

42:14.473 --> 42:20.120
And mainly what he thinks of is the corruption of values through journalism.

42:21.221 --> 42:25.666
But yes, I see closing times as a setting up.

42:25.686 --> 42:37.660
There's a line that this Mr. Pitcher quotes in there, which is the end of a kind of, quoting from the book says, the gods were growing tired again and it was time for another shakeup.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.242
I don't think the world's going to come to an end.

42:40.262 --> 42:46.209
I think the world I know and you know in America already has come to an end.

42:46.230 --> 42:54.259
And I think we're really in a time of political shambles, an economic shambles, an ethical anarchy.

42:54.279 --> 42:59.585
We don't know it yet, and I think something has to emerge.

42:59.725 --> 43:05.252
It may be better or worse, but usually it is a catastrophe if you see a change in this country.

43:05.592 --> 43:07.815
You talk about an ethical shakeup.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.484
Ethical anarchy.

43:10.944 --> 43:12.106
When you look at this O.J.

43:12.126 --> 43:19.718
Simpson thing, and the preoccupation with that, that's one of the things I think.

43:20.319 --> 43:22.222
The serious issue for that is this.

43:23.083 --> 43:29.213
It illustrates the concept of trial by jury.

43:29.412 --> 43:31.034
It's okay.

43:31.174 --> 43:36.662
And that a person could be presumed innocent or found guilty.

43:37.002 --> 43:37.984
No longer works.

43:38.004 --> 43:43.511
Those were principles that were valid at a time when the criminal population was very small.

43:44.212 --> 43:48.358
And the big fear, the biggest fear, was of government purity.

43:49.119 --> 43:50.761
Now, that's not our biggest fear.

43:50.801 --> 43:53.925
I mean, I see this defense team.

43:54.046 --> 43:57.430
And their mandate is not to give this guy the best defense.

43:57.450 --> 43:58.812
Their mandate is to get him off.

43:59.146 --> 44:13.582
If you were to ask me as a young guy, I would say, if it was up to me, I think all of DePaul's brothers should be in jail on the charge of this pre-obstruction of justice.

44:13.602 --> 44:16.845
Do you mind if I use that quote?

44:16.906 --> 44:20.890
Well, not to say, I would say this, but it would not be rivalrous.

44:21.050 --> 44:25.135
I did do an interview with Donald Westlake a couple of weeks ago.

44:25.155 --> 44:26.196
It was funny that he'd write these.

44:26.216 --> 44:26.436
Yeah, yeah.

44:26.838 --> 44:31.242
And he said, I said, what do you think about this?

44:31.282 --> 44:39.049
He said, well, if I were writing, he said, I would have looked both gloves in the same place.

44:39.069 --> 44:45.855
If I were writing it, I would have said, but, see, lawyers, like most professionals, they'll take fashion, they can, and that's, it's their own interest.

44:46.235 --> 44:55.984
What's good for them is what's right, and they would argue, say, well, our obligation is to make the state prove the charges, even if we know he's guilty.

44:56.707 --> 44:59.452
Just to jump a bit here.

45:00.214 --> 45:03.801
But what I meant was exactly that.

45:03.961 --> 45:09.011
It's corruption of justice, corruption of trial by jury, and that's just one cause was happening.

45:09.431 --> 45:11.676
And the nation accepted.

45:11.696 --> 45:15.964
There are two things, and then I'll, I promise I'll leave.

45:17.362 --> 45:24.852
In the preface of a Catch-22, you say, Yosarian may die, but he will not die by my end.

45:24.872 --> 45:25.553
Yeah, not by my end.

45:25.573 --> 45:28.957
And that is interesting, because I guess people have wondered what happened to Yosarian.

45:28.977 --> 45:31.120
Well, Yosarian will live.

45:31.140 --> 45:35.265
And just talk about maybe you didn't address yourself to that there.

45:35.285 --> 45:38.329
Well, at the end of Catch-22, he's alive.

45:38.349 --> 45:39.651
He's in trouble.

45:39.931 --> 45:45.799
Or as a former peasant would say, deep doo-doo, because he didn't say shit.

45:45.998 --> 45:47.640
But he is a liar.

45:47.921 --> 45:59.877
And repeating the pattern, in closing time, you're saying he's a liar, and making the same decision, or an analysis decision, as he made in cash money.

46:00.438 --> 46:10.993
Giving up a security of a kind that he does not relish, and taking a risk by going up outside where there might be a war raging,

46:11.345 --> 46:13.747
And I don't give the answer to that.

46:13.787 --> 46:19.814
Just as I'm happy for me, too, when people would ask me what happened to Yosara, I'd say, I have no idea.

46:19.894 --> 46:21.495
I left that open.

46:21.635 --> 46:24.298
And at the end of closing time, what happens to Yosara?

46:24.318 --> 46:25.640
And it's still open.

46:25.660 --> 46:33.928
The joke I like to make is, that's sort of 25 years from now, if I don't have an idea for a book, I'll write another thing open.

46:34.669 --> 46:39.934
And I imagine, you spoke about saying, if somebody else tried to

46:40.437 --> 46:43.480
as they do with Margaret Mitchell, the characters.

46:43.701 --> 46:48.106
To assume for you what... Well, I'd be dead by then.

46:48.146 --> 46:53.352
They're not allowed to be, but that's the permission of Michael Hayes instead of them.

46:53.372 --> 46:58.778
What do you think of something like that in general, tampering with the... I pay no attention to it.

46:58.798 --> 47:04.364
I mean, the book is not going to be... Well, I mean, it's not going to be good.

47:04.384 --> 47:06.867
It's obviously making it like a better trip.

47:07.252 --> 47:12.499
And, you know, that thing was just the kind of thing I wanted very much to avoid.

47:12.800 --> 47:18.908
I think it would be shameful for me to have done a sequel that would be just pure in the pan.

47:18.928 --> 47:20.931
You know, something flimsy and quick.

47:22.052 --> 47:27.600
And then one other, and our promise always is old.

47:27.620 --> 47:32.206
I guess this is the question I was going to ask earlier when we talked about seven, six, seven books.

47:32.226 --> 47:35.010
Do you view your work as a corpus at all?

47:35.030 --> 47:35.250
Yeah.

47:35.602 --> 47:42.168
I'm very much aware that all my novels have certain things together.

47:42.848 --> 47:49.874
And in this novel, there's one or two lines that appear from almost all my other books.

47:50.395 --> 47:52.316
It's not conscious.

47:52.336 --> 47:56.400
Originally, there were allusions to gold.

47:57.481 --> 48:04.967
I still think there's one or two that come from Billy's gold.

48:05.420 --> 48:09.205
There are a few choices that come from No Lear Can Matter.

48:09.225 --> 48:14.332
The nurse in Closing Time is The Nurse of No Lear Can Matter, and it's the nurse in my life.

48:15.033 --> 48:18.998
We're married now for six or seven years.

48:20.580 --> 48:25.627
There's catchphrase, there's not much of something happening in this.

48:25.848 --> 48:29.532
Maybe it's your mind.

48:31.035 --> 48:33.638
The sensibility is my own in all of these books.

48:34.107 --> 48:37.292
And consequently, it tends to be a similarity.

48:37.312 --> 48:46.286
It's an ironic view of society, and yet one is based on almost a simplistic sense of morality, which I have.

48:46.306 --> 49:00.148
And we get through these characters who are not Marvel, uh, uh, uh, what, uh, I handled, uh, not villainous, but not villainous.

49:00.500 --> 49:05.352
There's a narrowing of Joseph Heller.

49:07.337 --> 49:17.142
There's almost nobody in this book that she's offered as somebody obnoxious, or not even Milo, and not the man in the White House, whoever it may be.

49:17.476 --> 49:19.939
I've called a little prick.

49:19.959 --> 49:23.043
I was going to say, he may be a little prick.

49:23.343 --> 49:26.667
Well, I don't think you can use that.

49:26.687 --> 49:32.494
But in this novel, almost nobody is that, they're apprehensive, but almost nobody is what?

49:32.534 --> 49:33.675
Villainous.

49:34.055 --> 49:35.017
And the women.

49:35.377 --> 49:37.800
It's the first time in the work of mine.

49:37.900 --> 49:41.744
I've dealt with now as a series, as I will say.

49:41.765 --> 49:43.126
And the wives are wonderful.

49:43.466 --> 49:44.788
I don't say that both.

49:44.808 --> 49:46.470
I say that because I've been told.

49:47.092 --> 49:51.116
my interviewers and my friends who read, is it a woman or a woman?

49:51.136 --> 49:55.460
Is it a conscious knowing of Josephine or a natural woman?

49:55.520 --> 49:58.362
No, I think it has to do with the nature of this book.

49:58.382 --> 50:02.386
The tendency of Americans, American novels, it goes back a long way.

50:02.886 --> 50:15.698
At least, at least, anyway, is to treat women as being injurious to men's potential menaces to their integrity and their artistic aspirations.

50:16.555 --> 50:21.522
I think, I don't think it's peculiarly American, but you'd certainly find it.

50:21.542 --> 50:27.411
Marilyn Churn, Marilyn Stemmingway, and John O'Hara, it's almost not the sympathetic women.

50:27.431 --> 50:29.254
It's almost a happy marriage.

50:29.274 --> 50:32.158
Happy marriage is usually not the substance of my own.

50:32.659 --> 50:35.202
I have two happy marriages here.

50:35.222 --> 50:39.729
And I'm very pleased that I was able to bring it all so successfully.

50:40.770 --> 50:42.613
One general question to wrap it up.

50:42.982 --> 50:46.648
As you can tell, I'm very proud of this book.

50:46.668 --> 50:55.683
It's very much based on this review, and I've been told that there's a very good review coming out of the Chicago Tribune by John Aldridge.

50:56.444 --> 50:59.489
And the other day, a girlfriend of my wife called up.

50:59.509 --> 51:01.412
She's subscribed to Elle magazine.

51:01.932 --> 51:03.354
And she read Iron Graft.

51:03.494 --> 51:04.155
That's a woman.

51:04.576 --> 51:05.397
Yeah.

51:05.437 --> 51:10.584
Well, it validates the point you just made a minute ago about women.

51:10.764 --> 51:13.668
Well, what was I?

51:13.688 --> 51:18.374
She refers to me, my comic imagination is a national treasure.

51:19.196 --> 51:21.819
So you're catching me a ton of the hard work.

51:22.019 --> 51:24.943
I was aware of that on the way down today.

51:25.124 --> 51:26.526
I think this is going to be good.

51:26.546 --> 51:29.830
Everybody's going to drop them tomorrow at an interview, so I'm kind of glad I'm

51:30.097 --> 51:35.705
So it's a body of work that you're happy with.

51:35.746 --> 51:44.739
This is going to sound immodest, and it's more in England and more in Germany and more in Scandinavia than here.

51:45.260 --> 51:51.509
My five and six novels, if you count them, have a very high esteem than I am.

51:51.650 --> 51:56.197
In this country, we have too many very good novels.

51:56.217 --> 51:58.500
People pay attention to any one of them.

51:58.717 --> 52:02.823
But this is a value of work, and I am very proud of it.

52:03.684 --> 52:05.627
Where are your papers going?

52:05.647 --> 52:06.168
What's that?

52:06.228 --> 52:07.029
Your papers?

52:07.049 --> 52:08.291
Is there an institution?

52:08.311 --> 52:09.773
Oh, no, I have a bash.

52:09.854 --> 52:18.166
Brandeis got the papers from the past 22, and maybe something happened.

52:18.266 --> 52:21.230
But they've not contacted me about the others.

52:21.250 --> 52:22.913
I got them all together.

52:23.654 --> 52:26.378
Well, they can't.

52:26.813 --> 52:36.145
Way back, I tried to buy them back from Bandai Street, because they didn't give it to you, but there's nothing to mention.

52:36.225 --> 52:38.248
There's nobody to talk to them.

52:38.268 --> 52:44.275
They really don't seem to have a special collections of art in there, like Texas would be perfect.

52:44.316 --> 52:48.701
Texas, the New York Public Library, and BU.

52:48.721 --> 52:54.829
This book would be particularly interesting, because the first printed draft,

52:55.788 --> 52:58.051
was 1,100 pages.

52:58.071 --> 53:01.056
The second was 900, before I began editing.

53:01.436 --> 53:05.342
Then when I met with the editor, it was 1,700 pages.

53:05.523 --> 53:06.905
You mean the first set of galleys?

53:07.005 --> 53:08.627
No, no, no.

53:08.827 --> 53:21.306
My manuscript, the first part that I completed, as a printed manuscript, was 1,100 pages.

53:21.927 --> 53:25.451
And I knew even before I got there, that's quite huge.

53:25.471 --> 53:27.974
I didn't want to be that long, and it was over there.

53:28.475 --> 53:31.298
And then on my own, I went through it again.

53:31.319 --> 53:34.502
It was two on the page short, and it was two on the page short.

53:34.522 --> 53:37.786
And then you got it very great where you went.

53:37.806 --> 53:37.907
Yeah.

53:37.927 --> 53:40.810
But I think those manuscripts might be interesting.

53:40.830 --> 53:44.415
And I think there were three or four whole chapters to read it.

53:44.435 --> 53:49.981
And eventually they'll be published in Playboy, because Playboy did two chapters like this.

53:50.041 --> 53:51.343
That's what I think.

53:52.218 --> 53:53.672
I'm going to wrap it up in a second.
