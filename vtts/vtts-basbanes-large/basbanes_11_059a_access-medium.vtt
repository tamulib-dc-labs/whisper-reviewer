00:03.085 --> 00:04.267
Say anything about that.

00:04.287 --> 00:04.948
No, say anything.

00:05.008 --> 00:09.015
Anything you want.

00:09.035 --> 00:11.319
I think we should speak clearly, and then if you want to tell him not to quote you directly or not to be true.

00:11.339 --> 00:14.966
Or if you say shut that off for a second, I'll shut it off.

00:15.126 --> 00:21.958
But really, you know, this is really to help me to take notes furiously.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.340
I'm not worried.

00:24.843 --> 00:25.684
And I think we should...

00:26.221 --> 00:31.829
Well, for the sake, just tell us, for the record, what each of you do with that, I think.

00:31.989 --> 00:35.534
So, let's start with Andrea here, up by left.

00:35.554 --> 00:36.676
My name is Andrea Grind.

00:36.977 --> 00:45.188
I'm the Special Collection Librarian at the Main Library in the Book Arts and Special Collection Center.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.331
We're located on the sixth floor.

00:47.772 --> 00:49.394
Not quite an ivory tower.

00:50.616 --> 00:54.642
In a room that's not as nice as your old room, in the Old Main.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.383
but at least we have our collection.

00:58.403 --> 00:59.444
I'm Kathy Barmer.

01:00.265 --> 01:01.587
I work at the Presidio branch.

01:01.607 --> 01:12.338
I'm the branch manager of the Presidio branch, chief steward of the Librarian's Guild, and that's significant in terms of all this stuff.

01:12.378 --> 01:17.724
I mean, I wouldn't have gotten involved in this issue probably as the branch manager of the Presidio branch.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.527
Likewise.

01:21.789 --> 01:24.932
I'm also an officer of the Librarian's Guild.

01:25.874 --> 01:27.777
And this is Melissa.

01:28.077 --> 01:31.221
Melissa Riley, and I'm a branch floater.

01:31.261 --> 01:33.504
I'm a part-time but a permanent librarian.

01:33.545 --> 01:36.028
I've worked in the library since something like 1983.

01:37.971 --> 01:42.777
But I work in a lot of different branches, although in recent years I've worked a lot at one particular branch.

01:43.759 --> 01:53.552
And I'm also on the executive board of the Guild, and also I'm the chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Librarians Guild.

01:54.089 --> 02:12.270
I really was not even in the Guild until after the earthquake, and they started throwing the books at the Presidio branch, where I was at the time, the adult librarian, into the trash, and were going to shut down that building and turn it into a warehouse for all the books that hadn't circulated in less than two years.

02:13.231 --> 02:22.021
They were going to throw away a lot of books and put the rest of them in my branch, which meant they were going to throw the collections I'd worked on building up into the trash.

02:22.081 --> 02:23.843
One of my patrons got into the branch,

02:24.059 --> 02:25.481
saw them throwing books in the garbage.

02:25.682 --> 02:29.207
Admittedly, these were paperbacks off the paperback racks at that moment.

02:29.227 --> 02:30.529
They weren't catalog books.

02:31.010 --> 02:35.618
Those were really good paperbacks, but I had shown them carefully that were very interesting.

02:35.638 --> 02:40.025
They were the ones I couldn't get into the collection because they weren't in the catalog.

02:40.065 --> 02:41.888
That's how I got involved with this whole thing.

02:41.928 --> 02:49.560
I began to ask myself questions about lack of money for libraries as a sort of a covert form of censorship.

02:49.979 --> 02:56.669
and a whole panoply of intellectual freedom issues slowly became more and more apparent since 1989.

02:58.372 --> 03:00.855
It's interesting that all three of you mentioned the Guild.

03:00.875 --> 03:07.205
Why don't we start... How is it that the Guild is significant in this whole discussion?

03:08.026 --> 03:18.362
Well, it was the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Guild that put together this program, the program that started all of this.

03:18.382 --> 03:19.243
Started what?

03:19.477 --> 03:28.614
started the renewed interest or the scrutiny of the library.

03:28.674 --> 03:38.472
Yeah, that came out in the media, finally, after nine years of struggling and trying to get people's attention at what was going on.

03:39.814 --> 03:42.379
This May 30th event really had a nerve.

03:42.815 --> 03:47.763
This was after the New Main Library had opened.

03:47.963 --> 04:05.751
So after the New Main Library opened, and we knew already it was too small, we knew that the collections were in danger, did we know that things had been, we suspected that things had been discarded.

04:06.457 --> 04:10.463
But it wasn't until the public found out about it that it was significant.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.645
Now, you asked about the Guild.

04:11.865 --> 04:25.806
The Guild's connection to all of this is that Melissa and Andrea, as the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Guild, presented this lecture program.

04:26.006 --> 04:26.947
I love the card.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.809
Isn't it wonderful?

04:28.089 --> 04:29.551
It's wonderful.

04:30.172 --> 04:35.400
Mostly Melissa, because she was the one who got in touch with Nick Baker.

04:36.022 --> 04:37.964
Is that right?

04:38.064 --> 04:39.605
So you engaged Nick?

04:39.685 --> 04:52.936
Yeah, well, what happened is that Nick had his article on the card catalog in the New Yorker, you know, 1994 or something, and Pat Vanderberg, who was the librarian at the library school, was an old friend of mine.

04:52.956 --> 04:58.741
And so I called her up and got his number, I think, actual phone number, I think, or maybe it was the email address, I can't remember.

04:58.761 --> 05:05.927
Anyway, I either called him or emailed him shortly after the, what was it called?

05:06.228 --> 05:07.309
Discards?

05:07.530 --> 05:07.950
Discards.

05:08.231 --> 05:08.751
Discards.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.573
And talked for a while.

05:10.614 --> 05:16.861
And at that time, he had too many deadlines and was too busy to really get involved in what was happening at San Francisco Public.

05:17.943 --> 05:25.833
But we knew all along that after the new library opened, that there would be this nice new public room, a big auditorium, that would be perfect for a public event.

05:25.853 --> 05:31.560
And we thought it would be nice if the Guild sponsors a series of events on intellectual freedom issues.

05:31.861 --> 05:33.263
of various sorts.

05:33.323 --> 05:35.025
We invited Nick Baker to give his talk.

05:35.145 --> 05:37.488
At that moment, he had enough time to do it.

05:37.548 --> 05:42.734
Then he spent a number of months researching what he would say at that talk.

05:42.814 --> 05:46.519
Then we also asked Gray Brecken to speak.

05:46.759 --> 05:56.991
I didn't know Gray, but he was a friend of James Brooke, who had done a book with Ian Bowell about libraries and stuff like that.

05:57.545 --> 06:03.334
So the two of them were just a great duo, and we did this publicity, and we basically filled the room.

06:03.374 --> 06:05.418
Do you have a copy of this?

06:05.438 --> 06:06.640
Is this the actual talk?

06:06.860 --> 06:07.702
Oh, that's Dick's talk?

06:07.882 --> 06:09.144
Is that the original?

06:09.204 --> 06:10.226
He sent me this.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.828
Is this the thing about the weeds?

06:12.049 --> 06:12.750
Yes.

06:12.810 --> 06:15.274
I have this.

06:15.354 --> 06:21.544
I don't know if this is in...

06:21.912 --> 06:23.594
See, there was the New Yorker piece.

06:23.614 --> 06:25.617
Oh, oh, the New Yorker piece was called Weeds.

06:25.637 --> 06:25.977
No.

06:26.217 --> 06:26.498
No?

06:26.518 --> 06:26.998
No, no, no.

06:27.138 --> 06:30.082
It was going to be called Weeds.

06:30.102 --> 06:35.449
He might have given this to you when it was called Weeds.

06:35.469 --> 06:38.833
Because it went through, first it was the talk, then he made it on.

06:38.853 --> 06:40.234
This is an edited version?

06:40.755 --> 06:42.217
This is the original talk.

06:42.237 --> 06:43.418
Is this an extra copy?

06:43.478 --> 06:45.561
This is what he did.

06:45.621 --> 06:47.303
Somebody must have a copy of this, right?

06:47.383 --> 06:47.944
I have a copy.

06:48.004 --> 06:50.147
I have at least two copies back to the library.

06:50.227 --> 06:51.328
Okay, so you may have a copy.

06:52.304 --> 06:55.909
I encourage you to give me everything that you can.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.191
I'm sorry, Melissa.

06:57.331 --> 06:57.811
Oh, yeah, anyway.

06:59.293 --> 07:07.284
The people at that lecture, and we have a tape somewhere, too, were like, they wanted to storm the opening library on the spot.

07:07.384 --> 07:11.029
There were 225 people there or more.

07:11.049 --> 07:13.352
The place was packed.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.157
That auditorium had never been filled before for any, or never been filled again.

07:17.178 --> 07:20.522
Do you think they can just see to hear Nick Baker?

07:20.958 --> 07:23.002
Well, we did.

07:23.162 --> 07:25.586
Look at this wonderful flyer.

07:25.606 --> 07:26.788
Describe the flyer for me.

07:26.808 --> 07:28.531
Describe what that image is.

07:28.551 --> 07:31.156
The new main library is burning down.

07:31.176 --> 07:34.903
There's a fire coming out of the atrium.

07:34.923 --> 07:37.227
What's the significance of that?

07:37.267 --> 07:40.713
Well, it was a controversial library, first of all.

07:40.733 --> 07:44.620
It looks like you're certainly expressing your thoughts about it.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.132
It's a metaphor for the destruction of knowledge.

07:48.614 --> 07:57.027
We really don't know what drew 225 people there to tell you the truth, but thank God they were there.

07:57.047 --> 07:58.469
Well, we had very good publicity.

07:58.730 --> 08:00.092
We did.

08:00.272 --> 08:04.819
We had talk about some real grassroots action going on.

08:05.086 --> 08:08.992
hundreds of these flyers in all sorts of, in all colors.

08:09.312 --> 08:09.993
Chris Carlson.

08:10.053 --> 08:11.876
He doesn't want his name.

08:11.916 --> 08:12.937
Oh, he doesn't want his name.

08:12.957 --> 08:13.358
Oh, okay.

08:13.378 --> 08:17.924
Because he's trying to do a project for libraries.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.669
He's trying to do a project for libraries, but he doesn't know about the libraries he knows.

08:21.689 --> 08:24.133
Well, we had a pro bono designer.

08:24.393 --> 08:27.337
And he's distributed everywhere.

08:27.357 --> 08:29.560
And people on the inside and the outside.

08:29.821 --> 08:31.363
As one of the, you know,

08:31.580 --> 08:33.021
and stuff.

08:33.041 --> 08:36.765
Trust me, I'll probably use 3% of them.

08:36.785 --> 08:37.886
Yeah, we understand.

08:38.427 --> 08:40.408
But that's just one meme I know that he didn't be in.

08:40.428 --> 08:42.110
I mean, for years later, it may not be me.

08:42.450 --> 08:45.273
It's very interesting, though.

08:45.774 --> 08:50.258
When I think of the Baker stories, I almost think of them as a pair.

08:50.658 --> 08:51.899
But that's not the way it happened.

08:51.919 --> 08:55.463
He wrote the Discard story, and that was a discreet story.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.083
Oh, yeah.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.705
And then on the strength of that,

08:58.546 --> 09:04.214
Clearly, you knew he was living here, and so you invited him to participate on the strength of that.

09:04.414 --> 09:06.497
So one didn't necessarily lead into the other.

09:06.557 --> 09:08.761
Well, in my mind, one led to the other.

09:08.781 --> 09:13.968
I mean, from his standpoint, that was finished work as far as he was concerned.

09:13.988 --> 09:24.503
And he had no pants, but he also said, I remember it as him feeling a little maybe guilty that he didn't do enough work.

09:24.955 --> 09:32.526
for maybe his, and I think he even said this in a lecture about Rochester, his home, Rochester, New York.

09:32.626 --> 09:33.847
He says it in the New Yorker piece.

09:33.867 --> 09:40.477
Yeah, so he did say it in the New Yorker piece, so this was a way of atoning, I suppose.

09:40.497 --> 09:40.677
Yeah.

09:41.398 --> 09:42.279
And he sure did.

09:42.520 --> 09:46.645
He was the very first one who listened to us.

09:47.647 --> 09:48.428
The very first.

09:48.768 --> 09:49.670
Can you imagine?

09:49.770 --> 09:52.093
We had talked, well, I mean, we had talked to

09:52.647 --> 09:58.680
There were many journalists in large and small groups over the years since 1989.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.484
People were calling the material.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.872
Not just the three of us, but lots of people calling us.

10:04.413 --> 10:06.097
Nothing ever happened.

10:06.157 --> 10:12.090
The only time they were interested in the library was some sex scandal.

10:12.526 --> 10:14.068
Some books.

10:14.309 --> 10:18.374
I came to this recently that there would be a photograph of the dump truck with the books.

10:18.454 --> 10:23.462
I can't promise anything, but that could really be the title of the chapter.

10:23.482 --> 10:23.762
I don't know.

10:23.822 --> 10:25.865
That's just wonderful.

10:25.885 --> 10:27.087
Isn't it wonderful?

10:27.247 --> 10:29.811
I love good chapter titles.

10:30.471 --> 10:32.875
I was thinking of books in exile, so I don't know.

10:32.915 --> 10:33.696
This came to me.

10:33.756 --> 10:36.460
Maybe I was half asleep.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.463
Well, think of them, you know.

10:38.503 --> 10:39.725
There's Tilly Olsen.

10:40.085 --> 10:42.128
No, Dee just said something about that.

10:42.344 --> 10:44.587
Why are you holding these books?

10:45.649 --> 10:51.158
I'm waiting to repatriate them.

10:51.398 --> 10:54.503
I look at them as exiles.

10:54.743 --> 10:56.406
That's not bad.

10:56.867 --> 11:02.255
That would be wonderful if it can be determined that these books really should be part of the collection.

11:02.756 --> 11:03.377
Are you kidding?

11:03.457 --> 11:04.318
I saw the list.

11:05.179 --> 11:10.107
She's determined that fully 8% of them

11:10.542 --> 11:14.467
I don't care what they are.

11:14.487 --> 11:19.633
If it's a last copy, who's to judge what the content is?

11:19.653 --> 11:22.957
That's intellectual fascism.

11:23.157 --> 11:27.222
When you say a book deserves to be there, it doesn't because it's irrelevant.

11:27.643 --> 11:35.132
After the earthquake, when books were sent to storage in what is known as the Carlson Stacks, which is really just a

11:35.416 --> 11:36.158
How do we spell that?

11:36.178 --> 11:36.880
It was a hospital.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.367
It was named after a former library commissioner.

11:39.888 --> 11:41.933
Carlson, C-A-R-L-S-O-N.

11:41.973 --> 11:51.940
He found this remote storage for the books that had been in the stacks that had collapsed in the earthquake and they had to...

11:52.527 --> 11:57.453
So the way they determined which books from our collection would go to these remote stacks... That's very interesting.

11:57.473 --> 12:00.937
You see, this is almost the pyrotextual thing that I mentioned at the beginning.

12:00.997 --> 12:01.158
Exactly.

12:01.178 --> 12:01.638
Go ahead, yeah.

12:01.658 --> 12:06.364
The way they decided it was anything that hadn't circulated... In two years.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.145
In two years.

12:07.886 --> 12:08.086
Geez.

12:08.106 --> 12:10.149
Well, they started off with that.

12:10.209 --> 12:10.769
Two years?

12:10.829 --> 12:11.991
Yeah.

12:12.251 --> 12:15.776
It's totally... It's horrible.

12:15.816 --> 12:18.619
It's horrible because they decided...

12:18.734 --> 12:25.683
The administration and the department heads, certain department heads, decided that they were going to reorganize.

12:26.604 --> 12:38.559
So they reorganized, they shut down, they made one department disappear, they collapsed two other departments into one another, so the literature department was no more.

12:40.001 --> 12:48.572
The old history and social science department became the humanities department, along with the literature department.

12:48.721 --> 12:52.548
collapsing both of those forms into one.

12:53.991 --> 13:13.125
In order to create a huge circulating department, where they decided everything in every call number area, with the exception of business and science and art music, would be compressed into this.

13:13.645 --> 13:20.732
Thereby separating the librarians from their collections.

13:21.473 --> 13:30.502
It was just a big room that had once been a wonderful subject department, but it was just now a big room with all these temporary shelves in them.

13:30.662 --> 13:31.362
What kind of were they?

13:31.422 --> 13:32.463
Metal shelves?

13:33.745 --> 13:37.328
Wooden, like pine.

13:37.348 --> 13:39.130
There was no staff.

13:39.397 --> 13:41.219
No reference stuff in that room.

13:41.279 --> 13:46.645
Any time somebody with a page was in their books, they would just go and ask the page.

13:46.665 --> 13:47.806
It was horrible.

13:47.846 --> 13:55.415
There was nothing systematic about ... Basically, all the circulating books for the whole library, except for the children's books, were in that one room.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.817
This is post-earthquake.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.878
That was the excuse.

13:57.998 --> 13:59.900
That was the excuse.

13:59.920 --> 14:05.286
They used the earthquake to do this major reorganization.

14:05.435 --> 14:10.223
And then they said they were calling it a template for the new main.

14:10.243 --> 14:10.663
A template?

14:10.683 --> 14:10.944
Yeah.

14:10.964 --> 14:13.027
It was a template for the new main.

14:13.047 --> 14:13.808
Who was calling it that?

14:14.289 --> 14:14.770
Dallin.

14:14.790 --> 14:15.311
Oh, Dallin.

14:16.613 --> 14:21.240
And they had had plans to do this kind of thing before, but they had never been approved.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.063
They were just under discussion.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.605
But people were very unhappy about it.

14:24.625 --> 14:25.867
This was a great excuse.

14:25.967 --> 14:32.117
Dallin had been saying things like, let me tell you, there's three kinds of change, blah, blah, blah, but the fourth kind is.

14:32.097 --> 14:36.060
when you have an earthquake at the perfect time to rearrange your books.

14:36.140 --> 14:42.426
There's some quote that has been attributed to him to clean out the Augie's famous.

14:42.586 --> 14:46.069
It's in the Bay Guardian article.

14:46.329 --> 14:48.591
Isn't that something?

14:48.611 --> 14:51.514
To compare books to horseshit.

14:51.954 --> 15:01.362
But then there's the other famous quote that's so wonderful, and that's in Augie Kleinzeller's

15:01.544 --> 15:15.379
is that his last name, in the article, and I brought it with me, where his friend, the dean of some school at UC Berkeley, calls the new main library 20 pounds of shit in a 10-pound bag.

15:15.399 --> 15:16.800
I didn't know a dean said that.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.402
I've been saying that around to people.

15:18.422 --> 15:19.002
Oh, my goodness.

15:19.022 --> 15:24.128
And I had forgotten for the longest time who said it and where, and I found the article.

15:24.889 --> 15:25.870
Is that right?

15:25.890 --> 15:27.211
So we could document that?

15:27.231 --> 15:28.232
Oh, you could document that.

15:28.252 --> 15:29.914
You could call Augie.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.227
But Dallin didn't put that.

15:32.267 --> 15:36.414
Dallin did not say that this friend... Yeah, but that's a knockout to me.

15:36.474 --> 15:36.734
Right.

15:36.814 --> 15:37.515
Absolutely.

15:37.556 --> 15:39.459
But it doesn't about what it says.

15:39.579 --> 15:47.292
It really does say something about the vision, the so-called vision that went into the building of this library.

15:47.372 --> 15:52.240
And so what happened after the earthquake, which was a total...

15:52.625 --> 16:04.913
For anybody who still had some kind of belief that Denlon was doing the right thing, totally lost faith in him and became convinced that he was out to destroy them.

16:05.129 --> 16:10.075
what was, at that point, a good city library.

16:10.155 --> 16:10.536
Underfunded.

16:10.716 --> 16:11.357
Underfunded.

16:11.457 --> 16:13.259
Underfunded, apparently.

16:13.279 --> 16:24.213
Well, there was a period in the 60s when William Holman was there that they were pulling all these... I found him, by the way.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.235
You found him?

16:25.255 --> 16:26.136
You got his phone number?

16:26.156 --> 16:30.081
Well, I reached him, and he was on the road, and then I called home yesterday.

16:30.101 --> 16:33.465
In fact, when I was in Dallas, Fort Worth, my neighbor, and my wife said,

16:33.817 --> 16:43.675
And he knew the worth of the collection.

16:43.735 --> 16:46.820
I think he's a bookman.

16:47.021 --> 16:53.252
Yes, he is a bookman.

16:53.272 --> 16:55.977
His son's a printer.

16:56.193 --> 17:00.499
That matters.

17:00.920 --> 17:12.818
He was very much aware of the bibliophiles in the city and was instrumental in putting together that rare book room.

17:13.017 --> 17:17.305
He was the one who brought the Grant Warner collection to the library.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.809
He was responsible for that.

17:20.671 --> 17:27.022
He was also responsible for bringing in the Harrison collection of Calligraphy and Lettering.

17:27.362 --> 17:31.650
These are really important collections that he was involved in.

17:32.221 --> 17:35.266
was responsible for him, you know.

17:35.426 --> 17:37.189
So, did Darwin replace him?

17:37.229 --> 17:39.192
Where's Kevin Starr been in all this?

17:39.212 --> 17:43.658
He came after Homer, and then Franz, and then John Franz.

17:43.678 --> 17:46.843
I mean, I was shocked today to see that tape.

17:46.883 --> 17:50.489
They had also another one that was on the local PBS station.

17:50.989 --> 17:53.433
Yes, I just watched that again myself.

17:53.453 --> 17:55.176
I didn't know that Starr was the city library.

17:55.236 --> 17:58.701
I might have to talk to him.

17:58.934 --> 18:03.641
He was a civil librarian without being a librarian.

18:03.841 --> 18:04.842
That happens.

18:05.463 --> 18:07.927
Archibald McLeish wasn't a librarian.

18:07.947 --> 18:08.988
James Billington.

18:09.068 --> 18:10.971
I've interviewed James Billington.

18:10.991 --> 18:12.293
He's not a librarian.

18:12.633 --> 18:17.520
Paul LeClerc at the New York Public Library was doing spectacular things.

18:19.383 --> 18:22.668
Barton Gregorian is now at the Riverside.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.992
He's on the board.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.536
He just took over to Carnegie.

18:28.988 --> 18:33.434
Right, but he's on the board of the U. That's true.

18:33.454 --> 18:35.797
But he's on the board of Riverside?

18:35.817 --> 18:37.859
Yeah, but he's also on the board for Bill Gates.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.842
Yeah, but that's controversial.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.364
This Riverside thing is real.

18:41.384 --> 18:42.906
Well, it's Riverside, I don't know.

18:42.986 --> 18:45.329
That's a privatized library that I was telling you about.

18:45.349 --> 18:46.971
Totally privatized public library.

18:47.331 --> 18:49.134
Riverside, California?

18:49.214 --> 18:49.614
Yes, Riverside.

18:49.634 --> 18:50.415
The county library.

18:50.596 --> 18:53.279
Well, Sid Berger's down there at UC Riverside.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.861
Sid's a friend of mine.

18:54.841 --> 19:00.758
I'm surprised you haven't heard about this, the privatizing a library?

19:01.079 --> 19:05.712
Well, the counties were devastated by the budget cuts in the state.

19:05.962 --> 19:08.365
money was pulled out of the counties.

19:08.385 --> 19:10.467
I don't know exactly what the mechanism was.

19:12.670 --> 19:28.828
So the county libraries are all in bad shape, and in Riverside's case, they just completely... It's all about the Prop 13, because after Prop 13, the state was still reaching out that the state would give extra money to the libraries, especially the county libraries.

19:28.848 --> 19:33.353
But then, here it is, almost 10 years later, the state is getting...

19:33.333 --> 19:59.037
the economy got worse you know 15 years later and the state started like taking money away from the county so you have some counties in california and have libraries and so yeah and they and so this kind of thing well in new england kevin star will know because we have public libraries and every little town never mind well yeah kevin star will know that's a good question all those statistics for you

19:59.135 --> 20:04.402
But Riverside found itself, I don't know that much about it, but I'm assuming they found themselves in a budget crunch.

20:04.422 --> 20:05.904
They had no money for a library.

20:05.924 --> 20:09.469
They said, oh, well, we're really down to our last $2 million.

20:09.589 --> 20:10.851
How can we do this?

20:10.871 --> 20:17.280
No, I'm just guessing, but you mentioned that Barton is on this.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.564
Of course, you know that the New York Public Library is basically private.

20:20.584 --> 20:21.986
Private, yes, it is.

20:22.006 --> 20:23.428
It's a totally private library.

20:23.448 --> 20:23.949
Yes, we know.

20:23.969 --> 20:24.770
Now, not the branches.

20:24.810 --> 20:26.813
The branches are public.

20:27.316 --> 20:31.342
Fifth Avenue and all those great collections and the Schaumburg collection.

20:31.382 --> 20:37.451
That's a private... Paul LeClaire says to me, how much money do you think I have to raise every week?

20:38.933 --> 20:40.796
Every week to run this?

20:40.816 --> 20:42.819
And I said, $200,000.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.003
Let's try $600,000 a week.

20:45.023 --> 20:46.805
$30 million a year.

20:47.026 --> 20:51.312
And he just got $10 million to do this thing with P&A.

20:51.332 --> 20:54.737
He got Bill Blasky, $10 million.

20:55.138 --> 20:56.580
In fact, this is great.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.621
The other side is a contract.

20:58.681 --> 21:01.024
It's contracted out to a company.

21:01.044 --> 21:04.168
But the money is still coming from the government.

21:04.188 --> 21:07.232
The money for the library is still coming from the government.

21:07.252 --> 21:08.834
Well, that's a huge difference.

21:09.254 --> 21:09.494
It is.

21:09.514 --> 21:10.996
It's a totally different kind of project.

21:11.016 --> 21:11.597
Yeah, that really is.

21:11.917 --> 21:16.503
But this is... They're finding a cheaper... They think they're finding a cheaper way.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.105
They're outsourcing it.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.307
They're outsourcing it.

21:19.327 --> 21:21.830
They're outsourcing the whole system.

21:21.850 --> 21:23.732
They're saying, enough, we can't handle it.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.294
It's like sending your prisoners to Texas.

21:26.354 --> 21:28.277
It's like sending your prisoners to Texas.

21:28.738 --> 21:29.660
Because it's cheaper down there.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.763
And a lot of the same staff is supposedly there.

21:31.783 --> 21:38.435
I mean, they think that they can do it more efficiently, but I don't know what happens to civil service and all those sorts of things.

21:38.455 --> 21:39.236
Oh, it's gone.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.678
It's all gone, huh?

21:40.698 --> 21:42.982
If it's privatized, you can just get rid of it.

21:43.062 --> 21:46.328
If they're working for... If the librarians who are in the building are working...

21:46.848 --> 21:48.910
What's the name of the company?

21:49.050 --> 21:51.273
Oh, they're in Maryland.

21:51.373 --> 21:52.374
Yeah, they're in Maryland.

21:52.394 --> 21:53.275
We've got to know that.

21:53.295 --> 21:54.556
I mean, I'll go visit them.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.238
That's an interesting enough story.

21:56.618 --> 22:02.624
Well, the problem I think I might have with that, you know, maybe it's not.

22:02.644 --> 22:05.187
Well, I've got lots of problems.

22:05.287 --> 22:06.268
I have a problem.

22:06.308 --> 22:07.329
Who do you answer to?

22:07.369 --> 22:09.972
You know, I mean, I serve the people.

22:11.814 --> 22:16.078
You know, in a public library, public librarians serve the people.

22:16.463 --> 22:19.708
who are paying for this service.

22:20.289 --> 22:24.515
And so in a private library, I'm not quite sure that that happens.

22:24.535 --> 22:26.558
Well, are there librarians even?

22:26.578 --> 22:32.587
I mean, I'm sure that to become efficient that you're... Who's picking the bus?

22:32.607 --> 22:34.069
I know.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.612
How exactly has it all happened?

22:35.632 --> 22:43.804
When they're trying to do things on the cheap, they're doing what they tried to do at San Francisco Public, which is what David Price and Ken Dowling tried to do was

22:46.433 --> 22:52.542
We saw it coming, we knew it was coming, but it was really him or us, because he wanted to get rid of the librarians.

22:53.403 --> 23:07.564
He wanted technicians to be answering questions, and he wanted retired visiting scholars, retired, what did he call them, scholars in residence, to be

23:07.882 --> 23:12.988
Ordering the books, selecting the materials, and being the resource.

23:13.028 --> 23:16.412
Like the editorial board of the Book of the Month Club.

23:16.432 --> 23:25.622
They meet once a month over copy, and somebody's giving them a waste, and they go rubber stamp them, and that's that Bennett syrup, and all these other things.

23:26.503 --> 23:29.687
Visiting scholars give them a stipend.

23:29.971 --> 23:31.534
A very generous stipend.

23:31.554 --> 23:32.836
Or maybe get him to do it for free.

23:32.896 --> 23:36.702
Look at all those retired librarians that got four other jobs that you've worked with.

23:36.722 --> 23:41.910
Well, that's, I think, how little he either understood or cared about what the public library did.

23:41.930 --> 23:56.434
And in particular, this public library, he had absolutely, there was no respect at all for what this particular, what this library was about, nor was there any respect for the work of the library staff.

23:57.022 --> 24:03.295
I mean, was this a sense that you had that you were on this guy's hit list?

24:03.475 --> 24:05.660
Or was there anything really explicit?

24:05.680 --> 24:07.704
Oh, he was doing things all the time to dumb down.

24:07.724 --> 24:10.730
Well, first of all, he dumbed down the collections or the departments.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.654
He eliminated departments.

24:12.674 --> 24:15.921
So when you do that... Can you give me some examples?

24:15.981 --> 24:18.085
He got rid of literature.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.334
History and social science.

24:21.354 --> 24:22.696
History and social science and literature.

24:22.736 --> 24:25.600
But I'm going to get some questions to ask him.

24:25.740 --> 24:26.882
I was seeing him this week.

24:26.982 --> 24:33.711
Okay, he put... What would you like to have him answer?

24:33.731 --> 24:36.475
I'm asking you to compose my questions.

24:36.495 --> 24:44.166
What I'm trying to say is he took away our subject expertise.

24:44.206 --> 24:46.249
He tried to eliminate...

24:46.533 --> 24:53.661
the experts in the library by combining things together and thereby, what did he call it?

24:53.741 --> 24:55.022
Leveling the access.

24:55.222 --> 24:56.083
Leveling the access.

24:56.103 --> 25:03.652
He did not believe, and still does not believe, that San Francisco Public Library is a research-level public library.

25:03.912 --> 25:07.476
What is meant by the phrase, leveling the access?

25:07.496 --> 25:09.638
That would be a really good thing.

25:09.803 --> 25:11.866
That's another way to ask questions.

25:12.207 --> 25:19.999
Instead of being confrontational, what is meant by the phrase, and then we start our conversation.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.504
Another thing is, I don't know how you put it, but maybe we can figure this out.

25:23.685 --> 25:24.847
What did he mean by it?

25:24.927 --> 25:34.241
He meant by giving very popular titles abroad and shallow.

25:36.064 --> 25:37.887
This is also...

25:38.407 --> 25:42.673
That's why we feel that a lot of the dumping happened.

25:42.693 --> 25:49.843
Supposedly, you would be reaching out to more people by giving them more breath dollars, or something like that, is what it comes down to.

25:49.863 --> 26:01.080
Well, that's what they were saying about, that's how they were selling the New Main to the Library Foundation, was we're going to go out and reach people we've never reached before.

26:01.981 --> 26:06.928
And the way they had to do that was to promise them something that a public library couldn't provide them.

26:08.039 --> 26:11.822
But they made it seem like... Internet access.

26:11.842 --> 26:13.424
Oh, no, just a place.

26:13.444 --> 26:13.844
Videotapes.

26:13.864 --> 26:14.385
A place.

26:14.845 --> 26:15.966
A spot.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.888
The African American Center.

26:18.088 --> 26:19.930
The Filipino Center.

26:19.950 --> 26:23.413
The Gay and Lesbian Center.

26:23.493 --> 26:24.734
This is shocking.

26:24.934 --> 26:27.436
And they did it by... What do they call them?

26:28.337 --> 26:28.537
Affinity.

26:28.597 --> 26:29.258
Affinity.

26:29.458 --> 26:29.958
Affinity.

26:30.038 --> 26:34.242
And that's even... Oh, they took that directly from the nuclear movement.

26:34.262 --> 26:35.323
The nuclear movement.

26:35.403 --> 26:37.405
Anti-nuclear movement had affinity groups.

26:37.537 --> 26:41.203
This is called the Great Paradigm Shift.

26:41.544 --> 26:44.268
This is the Great Paradigm Shift.

26:44.288 --> 26:56.408
This is based upon one person's vision, not necessarily balance, but one or two people's vision of what this library should be.

26:56.448 --> 27:01.216
It wasn't based on anything we had ever seen before.

27:01.236 --> 27:02.498
It was based upon what

27:02.731 --> 27:05.695
they saw in New York or somewhere else.

27:05.755 --> 27:06.696
In fact, we were told.

27:06.716 --> 27:07.297
Yeah, whose name?

27:07.537 --> 27:10.781
Well, Steve Coulter and Ken Dallin.

27:10.801 --> 27:15.887
They went to visit, Coulter even says, when he went to visit the Schomburg Collection in New York.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.751
That was where he got this idea.

27:18.931 --> 27:22.495
The original idea, well, she knows.

27:22.515 --> 27:26.040
But the Library Foundation ran up against a brick wall.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.464
They raised a certain amount of money, and it stopped.

27:29.984 --> 27:36.574
And I can't, I don't remember what year, but I guess in 1992 or so, it stopped at 16 million or 93.

27:36.594 --> 27:38.097
It stopped at 16 million?

27:38.357 --> 27:38.637
Yes.

27:38.938 --> 27:39.439
Sixteen.

27:39.479 --> 27:40.040
Sixteen.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.682
Now, what's the Library Foundation?

27:42.403 --> 27:46.429
Oh, well... Forgive me.

27:46.790 --> 27:54.762
The Library Foundation was created because when you have a public bond... This is a public entity.

27:55.003 --> 27:56.565
No, no, no.

27:56.748 --> 28:04.205
When you have a public bond to build a building in San Francisco, or probably in many cities, there's a restriction on the use of the funds.

28:04.286 --> 28:08.014
The voters work for the bond, so the restrictions are it can only be for the building.

28:08.836 --> 28:13.407
And that money can't be used for operating expenses, and it can't be used for furnishings.

28:13.741 --> 28:15.423
A bookshelf, or book anything.

28:15.704 --> 28:16.505
Or a computer.

28:16.745 --> 28:18.448
Can I interrupt you?

28:18.748 --> 28:20.691
We're refurbishing the city hall.

28:21.052 --> 28:26.780
If they need new desks in there, are they forming a foundation to raise some money for the new desks for city hall?

28:26.800 --> 28:32.588
If you build a new school, you have to have a foundation to put desks in the school.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.231
There's something wrong with this somehow.

28:34.832 --> 28:39.158
I think it was interpreted in such a way that

28:39.340 --> 28:40.061
We needed more.

28:40.161 --> 28:43.745
Anyway, what the library felt they understood was that we needed more money.

28:46.147 --> 28:50.371
What they really needed more money was for staff, but they didn't do anything about that.

28:50.792 --> 29:00.882
I have to say that I worked in the office with Kathy Page in Facilities Development, so I'm not coming from outside going, oh, they were doing good things.

29:00.902 --> 29:01.703
I mean, I could see.

29:02.023 --> 29:03.525
I said to her,

29:04.265 --> 29:05.586
Oh, I lost my train of thought.

29:06.367 --> 29:07.849
We're talking about the library board.

29:08.089 --> 29:13.875
Okay, so this foundation was formed because we needed $30 million.

29:16.117 --> 29:19.000
And I don't know how they picked that goal, but that was their goal.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.522
And what were they going to do with that $30 million?

29:21.562 --> 29:22.583
We're still working.

29:22.603 --> 29:24.505
The desk, the computer.

29:24.525 --> 29:26.687
All the equipment, all the furniture.

29:26.847 --> 29:28.289
Anything that wasn't built.

29:28.809 --> 29:32.533
But in addition, as the thing developed,

29:32.969 --> 29:47.284
It became apparent that the $100 million that was in the bond was not adequate to do anything except build the shell or with the most basic... Concrete or something.

29:47.404 --> 29:51.348
Infrastructure or whatever the hell.

29:51.428 --> 29:53.009
Yeah, it wouldn't make it pretty.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.411
It would make it functional.

29:55.592 --> 29:58.555
It would be adequate, but it wouldn't be pretty.

29:58.575 --> 30:00.597
So as they brought people in,

30:00.931 --> 30:06.318
To raise money from people, they had to tell them it's going to be grand.

30:07.059 --> 30:09.922
And we're going to give you a gay and lesbian affinity center?

30:09.942 --> 30:11.224
No, no, no.

30:11.304 --> 30:13.947
When it first started, it wasn't like that.

30:13.987 --> 30:17.011
When it first started, it was raising money for the library.

30:17.031 --> 30:22.238
You got the usual socialites and the usual people who contribute to the opera and those sorts of things.

30:22.758 --> 30:24.000
You got money from them.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.985
But they reached a point that they couldn't get the $30 million.

30:28.387 --> 30:30.931
And so they got this team.

30:30.951 --> 30:31.832
Who came up with this idea?

30:31.852 --> 30:32.873
Who came up with this?

30:32.893 --> 30:33.514
Steve Golden.

30:33.855 --> 30:36.358
Well, he says he... Well, ask him.

30:36.398 --> 30:43.488
Yeah, ask him how he came up with it, because my understanding is that he... How did you come up with the affinity idea for the affinity group?

30:43.508 --> 30:44.269
Oh, yeah, yeah.

30:44.289 --> 30:54.343
I think what I thought happened was that when they... Before, when they first started making maps to the library, the two...

30:54.644 --> 31:02.173
chief architect at a local firm and a priest, Simon and Tree, and then Coulter and Kathy Page,

31:03.014 --> 31:26.946
and went on a tour of libraries grand libraries in europe and on the east coast and they didn't they didn't come back with an appreciation of books anyway so then he visited the sean burke and got the idea for the gay and lesbian center at that time so i've always believed

31:26.926 --> 31:31.106
This is what you can find out.

31:31.709 --> 31:34.945
The original intention was to have a gay and lesbian

31:35.566 --> 31:45.236
It makes sense that you would actually have a place for authors to put their papers, and it would be really a research center.

31:45.256 --> 31:47.959
Fundamentally, I think that's a great idea.

31:48.100 --> 31:48.500
Yeah, it is.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.965
They fundraised, but they found out that it was so successful.

31:53.025 --> 31:59.051
So they started with this, but then when they went, they thought, let's do it for these other ethnic groups besides the gays.

31:59.071 --> 32:03.396
And then you went into trouble, because this really had a function as being, here you have a city which is

32:03.848 --> 32:05.550
probably more gay than any other.

32:05.590 --> 32:13.460
You have all these authors, you have a real archival function, and it actually made sense.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.244
Maybe you could have a librarian that would tend it, and so forth.

32:16.464 --> 32:28.860
But if you duplicate that for all these others... Well, what it's doing, though, is really scary.

32:29.026 --> 32:32.511
disparage Filipino-Americans anyway.

32:32.531 --> 32:35.996
But then other people will say, well, why didn't you pick us?

32:36.056 --> 32:39.741
There's no author center.

32:40.903 --> 32:44.728
There's no poetry center.

32:44.748 --> 32:48.013
They never went to the literary community in the city.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.137
Which is not inconsiderable.

32:51.157 --> 32:52.379
That's the point.

32:52.399 --> 32:57.987
They tried to crush the literary, I mean, that's the whole thing about the

32:58.473 --> 33:20.532
The abomination that is over there on that third floor, and it's called General Collections and Humanities, is because, Dallin, I really believe that the administration and whoever decided on this road went out of their way to exclude the literary community.

33:21.273 --> 33:23.417
Our literature department

33:23.937 --> 33:24.658
is no more.

33:25.038 --> 33:28.522
I mean, that was what was hit on in a major way.

33:28.542 --> 33:29.463
You mean in terms of books?

33:29.744 --> 33:30.865
In fiction?

33:31.085 --> 33:32.887
Well, it was partly dumped.

33:33.408 --> 33:36.592
But first of all, there is no literature department anymore.

33:36.832 --> 33:38.274
That means no subject specialties.

33:38.334 --> 33:39.756
No subject specialties.

33:39.776 --> 33:49.607
It was rolled into something called the humanities department, which is fine with me if it incorporates all of these different areas of the humanities.

33:49.992 --> 33:52.056
at a research level.

33:52.116 --> 33:52.958
Yeah, fine.

33:53.058 --> 34:03.078
But then when you go further and decide, oh, you're going to call it the General Collections Department, well, I said to Mr. Gallen, but that's so amorphous.

34:03.239 --> 34:05.443
I mean, what is that, General Collections?

34:05.483 --> 34:09.030
He said, well, and humanities isn't amorphous.

34:09.050 --> 34:09.531
He said?

34:09.752 --> 34:09.992
Yes.

34:10.748 --> 34:31.660
What is the rap against you people from the other side, the librarians?

34:31.910 --> 34:37.096
This was the letter.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.237
This was the famous letter.

34:38.858 --> 34:44.424
We gave the Library Foundation.

34:45.085 --> 34:48.308
It's private, totally private.

34:49.750 --> 34:55.116
We have no oversight.

34:55.619 --> 34:59.404
They aren't required to make any public disclosure, right?

34:59.665 --> 35:00.566
No, they are not.

35:00.586 --> 35:03.590
Now, they have a contract with the library, the MOU.

35:04.432 --> 35:16.909
And we in the Guild fought that MOU because one of the things was... Before the library opened, this is complicated, but one of the things that they wanted to do was continue to raise money for the library.

35:17.210 --> 35:23.719
Now, when the Library Foundation was first formed to raise money for the New Main, we were told that it was a...

35:24.003 --> 35:50.736
temporary thing we they would be we'd go back we have the friends we have our you know fundraising but after the new main was built the foundation was just getting going and so they wanted to raise money for the branches they wanted to raise money for an endowment for books they wanted to do all these things and the way they were going to do this was to have events in the library and rent the space like a bar mitzvah like

35:51.053 --> 35:53.936
a corporate Christmas party.

35:53.956 --> 35:55.758
And that would be fine.

35:55.838 --> 35:56.999
I'm Nick Grosgames.

35:57.060 --> 35:57.760
I've written a book.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.502
My publisher wants to send me here.

35:59.602 --> 36:00.904
We want to rent the hall.

36:01.324 --> 36:02.465
Yeah, well, that would be better.

36:02.485 --> 36:04.367
I was just saying, hey, great.

36:04.648 --> 36:05.208
That's great.

36:05.769 --> 36:09.914
It'll cost you 500 bucks for the room and for the caterer.

36:09.934 --> 36:15.219
Even that might be fine if there were certain limitations on how this all happened.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.702
But instead, what they envisioned was

36:18.104 --> 36:23.049
$20,000 to rent the atrium to some big corporation.

36:24.010 --> 36:27.935
Or they claimed that they were going to raise how many million?

36:27.955 --> 36:28.655
I don't even know.

36:28.695 --> 36:38.386
But when they went for their MOU, the MOU was giving them permission to be in charge of events management.

36:38.486 --> 36:39.747
Yes, exactly.

36:40.308 --> 36:43.131
The real trouble is two things.

36:43.311 --> 36:45.073
One is that the building was not built

36:45.053 --> 36:50.019
They wanted the run of the collection.

36:50.579 --> 36:55.145
They wanted the run of, for instance, all of the Special Collections Department.

36:55.165 --> 36:55.425
Sorry.

36:55.845 --> 36:57.768
So that every night there would be these events.

36:57.788 --> 37:07.058
Now, the other thing is the library closes at 8 o'clock at the latest every night, and 5 or 6 o'clock, 5 o'clock Friday, Friday and Sunday, 6 o'clock Monday.

37:07.319 --> 37:09.441
So the other theory was they were going to pump

37:09.961 --> 37:11.783
True, lots of groups.

37:11.803 --> 37:22.938
But the point of the building and having these meeting rooms, a Latino-Hispanic meeting room in that auditorium, was so that the public would have a place to have free events.

37:23.599 --> 37:36.576
But because the foundation wanted to make the money off of it, and because they decided to close the library so early, there weren't going to be a single night when anybody could actually have a program in the evening for the public for free, because you'd have to leave by quarter to eight.

37:37.045 --> 37:38.186
to empty the building.

37:38.747 --> 37:53.260
And then when the library, before it opened and they were thanking the funders for things, they were like, and they're still doing it, walking in the stacks in the new periodical room with this grease going up in the air.

37:53.961 --> 37:55.002
Yeah, it was a walk.

37:55.142 --> 38:01.768
The last event they had, they were cooking with a walk in the newspaper and periodical room.

38:01.788 --> 38:03.610
It had food on every floor.

38:04.501 --> 38:06.848
This was for the nearest convention.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.833
Where they closed the library down.

38:09.535 --> 38:11.220
We're not the only library where this is happening.

38:11.240 --> 38:19.624
They closed down Denver Public's new building for five days to have the G7, G8 there.

38:20.110 --> 38:21.292
What's G7?

38:21.372 --> 38:26.078
You know, the European Economic Summit that they have.

38:26.098 --> 38:27.460
They took over the library.

38:27.921 --> 38:35.852
They moved collections, we understand, so that the G8 people could... Yeah, they were trying to figure out how to accommodate... Oh, the Europeans!

38:35.912 --> 38:42.481
So, I mean, it's not as if we're the worst, but, you know, you've got to draw the line, you know.

38:42.541 --> 38:44.925
I'd go outside.

38:44.985 --> 38:46.146
Well, that's a good story.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.189
I mean, has this been published anywhere?

38:48.229 --> 38:48.750
Yeah.

38:48.730 --> 38:53.358
In American Libraries or LJ, I think I remember seeing and hearing short readings.

38:53.378 --> 38:56.323
John Berry is, it'll be a wonderful course for you.

38:56.723 --> 38:58.186
John Berry is the editor of Library Journal.

38:58.206 --> 39:02.553
He's written there editorials for the last 30 years, and he's a friend of mine for 30 years.

39:04.296 --> 39:09.424
He's a very delightful man.

39:10.466 --> 39:14.653
Are people suggesting that

39:15.022 --> 39:17.424
Clearly, this is not for salaries or anything like that.

39:17.444 --> 39:19.406
It's not like going out on strike.

39:20.087 --> 39:25.052
You know, we're talking about a deal.

39:25.312 --> 39:26.573
Well, you know what?

39:26.613 --> 39:29.196
What's the obligation?

39:29.296 --> 39:30.137
This is what they think.

39:30.397 --> 39:31.138
This letter came.

39:31.238 --> 39:43.830
Now, we fought against the MOU to get some changes, to get some control, to get the library, because $10 was signing over the library to the Library Foundation, a private institution that had no oversight.

39:44.063 --> 39:48.748
He was doing it, and we were the only people standing in their way.

39:48.788 --> 39:49.208
Right.

39:49.228 --> 39:52.311
And so we... And we barely knew anything about it ourselves.

39:52.552 --> 39:57.476
And we talked about keeping the public library for the public, and we, you know, did all this thing.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.457
And we were going to the church.

39:58.517 --> 40:01.340
Do we know who we are with people who are on there?

40:01.400 --> 40:04.343
Well, there's a board of the foundation.

40:04.363 --> 40:05.444
Oh, I have it right here.

40:05.545 --> 40:09.008
But this letter was signed with people from...

40:09.275 --> 40:10.517
From the affinity groups.

40:10.537 --> 40:11.078
From the affinity groups.

40:11.178 --> 40:14.864
And it did not come with the Library Foundation letterhead.

40:15.224 --> 40:17.548
So it's not from the Foundation.

40:17.608 --> 40:25.520
It's just some of these people who were so affronted by us that they had to say that we were... Who's the letter written to?

40:25.540 --> 40:26.141
The entire library staff.

40:26.181 --> 40:30.127
The library staff and Ken Dallin made sure there was like 50 copies.

40:30.147 --> 40:32.831
It was put out with the paycheck.

40:33.211 --> 40:35.535
With each paycheck, you got one.

40:35.988 --> 40:54.402
one thing that had happened is that toba singer had toba singer is a guild member not one of us

40:54.382 --> 41:15.276
like toba singer wrote an article an op-ed piece that appeared in the examiner where she all the stuff you're getting okay where she criticized the foundation for um the op-ed piece what did she say exactly oh just the organization organization um wow let me see it was really it was an important

41:15.323 --> 41:22.590
In the words of Dr. Arthur H. Coleman, co-chair of the African American Affiliate Group, Toby Singer has a curious use of words.

41:22.650 --> 41:27.255
To the black community, window dressing is what we got when we were not allowed to participate.

41:27.695 --> 41:29.577
It was an effort to appease us.

41:30.017 --> 41:38.386
Does anyone truly think that the African American community is so naive that it would ever contribute over a half million dollars for window dressing in May?

41:38.406 --> 41:44.892
And the point is, so you end up with these rooms which are untended, don't have money for the collection,

41:45.428 --> 41:47.471
They cause all kinds of problems.

41:47.491 --> 41:49.054
There's people doing graffiti in them.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.996
Was any of this money earmarked?

41:51.016 --> 41:53.040
It was supposed to be, but wait.

41:53.060 --> 41:53.981
To build a pretty room.

41:54.301 --> 41:55.343
To build a pretty room.

41:55.363 --> 41:56.825
Oh, even not even already here.

41:57.006 --> 41:57.687
But wait a minute.

41:57.707 --> 41:59.549
I just have to say something, too.

41:59.910 --> 42:06.600
This was about the ghettoization of the library collections that were formerly all together.

42:06.780 --> 42:07.982
Everybody was equal.

42:08.483 --> 42:11.127
Everybody was about inclusiveness.

42:11.247 --> 42:11.528
Right.

42:11.568 --> 42:13.090
During the great dumping,

42:13.643 --> 42:27.338
that happened, during the great dumping that happened, you can believe, because I witnessed it, that there were African-American titles that were being dumped.

42:27.599 --> 42:29.965
And here, they're talking about

42:30.822 --> 42:41.816
What was so interesting about the foundation is that they claim to be reaching out to people that the librarians, the library, had never reached out to.

42:42.056 --> 42:43.357
Steve Colton would say that all the time.

42:43.377 --> 42:45.340
The library never reached out to the community.

42:45.660 --> 42:46.762
How are you supposed to reach out?

42:47.082 --> 42:49.905
Well, we didn't have money because it's a public institution.

42:49.926 --> 42:50.046
Right.

42:50.066 --> 42:51.387
But we did.

42:51.407 --> 42:52.268
We had branches.

42:52.429 --> 42:53.650
We talked about people.

42:53.670 --> 42:55.773
People are really happy when you borrow something.

42:55.793 --> 42:56.434
Yeah, that's right.

42:56.454 --> 42:59.277
If anybody else, the colleges didn't take things.

42:59.257 --> 43:01.880
How can I help you?

43:02.221 --> 43:07.347
We have branches devoted to the Spanish community, the black community, the Asian community.

43:07.707 --> 43:10.791
We have no restriction on anybody using it.

43:10.811 --> 43:12.413
We have international language collection.

43:12.433 --> 43:14.195
We have Russian collection.

43:14.495 --> 43:16.177
We've always done this.

43:16.197 --> 43:22.785
But Steve Colter recognized, I think it's tainted by his view of the gay and lesbian thing, which is different.

43:22.805 --> 43:24.607
Yeah, see, he doesn't understand the difference.

43:24.627 --> 43:27.070
He puts all these racial categories.

43:27.353 --> 43:29.477
Race categories in what's gay and lesbian.

43:29.497 --> 43:42.704
Now, the gay and lesbian collection, and he'll talk to you about this, the center, has a really important purpose that's sort of the opposite of the public life.

43:42.724 --> 43:48.957
Well, they believe that they're setting aside stuff to keep it safe from the government.

43:51.333 --> 43:55.881
He said that at a commission meeting.

43:55.901 --> 44:03.114
We're keeping it in case a bad government comes into power and wants to destroy our culture.

44:03.134 --> 44:04.877
Oh, like the Magnus Hirschfeld.

44:06.259 --> 44:09.004
All kind of stuff that I have.

44:09.203 --> 44:15.331
Oh, you know, pulp novels, papers, Randy Schiltz.

44:15.351 --> 44:16.953
Oh, yeah, those manuscripts.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.495
Randy Schiltz collection.

44:18.755 --> 44:21.920
Randy Schiltz collection and the film collection of Peter Adair.

44:21.940 --> 44:22.060
Right.

44:22.781 --> 44:27.547
And the manuscript collections are kept up in our department, in the San Francisco History Center.

44:27.567 --> 44:31.532
There's bizarro things going on because there weren't any real...

44:32.170 --> 44:37.982
ways for them to develop the collection in the same place that the center was.

44:38.002 --> 44:44.475
The basic problem is instead of the library deciding what kind of library it is and what it needs and what it wants to be,

44:44.742 --> 44:46.785
This was driven by money.

44:46.985 --> 44:47.826
Where's the money?

44:47.886 --> 44:48.787
Where's the money?

44:48.868 --> 44:54.896
But it's true that we believe that the gay and lesbian collection was a good idea, but even that was not really good.

44:54.956 --> 44:57.880
What's really funny about it is he's not protecting it.

44:58.080 --> 45:02.406
He doesn't want to protect the culture from corporatization.

45:02.846 --> 45:05.229
He doesn't want to protect the culture from other forces.

45:05.249 --> 45:06.771
He's protecting the culture against government.

45:06.791 --> 45:13.180
If you really want to build a great collection, as you should, then this is the city to do it in, and this is the place to do it in.

45:13.160 --> 45:29.421
You'd go out and you'd do a search and you'd come up with, I'm trying to think, a scholar, ideally gay in this particular case, who would go out and build the collection, who would know the kinds of things.

45:29.601 --> 45:35.168
The idea would be to have somebody build it, curate it, and

45:35.468 --> 45:39.593
But collection seems to be quite irrelevant to the whole thing.

45:40.033 --> 45:46.280
At the same time, they were developing this, so-called developing this, with their vision.

45:46.961 --> 45:57.552
They were ordering the mass dumping of our book collections, which included the very books that are supposed to be in the Etc.

45:57.592 --> 45:59.134
Let's talk about the great dumping.

45:59.795 --> 46:04.800
At what point were you people aware of

46:05.202 --> 46:06.704
After the earthquake.

46:06.724 --> 46:11.469
The fact that, you know, it's like, I mean, you hate to make comparisons.

46:11.489 --> 46:16.635
Like, when in the 30s and the 40s, people noticed that their neighbors were disappearing.

46:17.215 --> 46:19.578
They were going off to cut.

46:19.598 --> 46:20.219
Immediately.

46:20.259 --> 46:22.682
And the Black Mariahs were coming for them, too.

46:22.702 --> 46:25.545
The Black Mariahs were coming for our books.

46:25.765 --> 46:28.869
And I don't care if I use... Stand by my language.

46:28.989 --> 46:30.150
I will stand by my language.

46:30.530 --> 46:32.292
Except there were white trucks.

46:32.473 --> 46:34.635
They attacked Nicholson for saying...

46:34.615 --> 46:45.810
That was a library staff member talking about the discard room.

46:46.051 --> 46:50.336
But the fact is, we were all aware of what was happening after the earthquake.

46:50.757 --> 46:55.443
We knew that there were books that were destroyed because of the earthquake.

46:56.665 --> 46:59.509
I participated in trying to make sure that there were

46:59.776 --> 47:11.654
in my department, which was literature at that time, we had them taken care of, but we sent them to be repaired, either by FEMA monies or through our preservation department.

47:11.674 --> 47:16.081
They either were repaired or they were preserved in some way.

47:16.302 --> 47:24.975
Or if they were so totally destroyed by the earthquake, they had to be withdrawn, and that was just totally understandable.

47:24.995 --> 47:28.180
But at the same time, when all of these

47:28.531 --> 47:31.836
There were a couple of things going on at one time.

47:32.136 --> 47:36.282
Books that hadn't circulated in two years got sent to Carlson Stacks.

47:36.603 --> 47:47.158
People went through, librarians went through with stamps, stamping of books to look as though they had been circulated.

47:47.178 --> 47:47.679
Is that right?

47:47.779 --> 47:48.220
That's right.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.463
Well, green-tagged books... Did you do any of this?

47:50.483 --> 47:53.948
Well, I was in that department that did it.

47:54.350 --> 47:57.856
I served up green tags for any book I wanted to keep.

47:58.217 --> 48:02.685
A green tag meant you stayed.

48:03.306 --> 48:07.693
What meant it was dead?

48:07.773 --> 48:10.598
First, let me go through all the different tags.

48:10.779 --> 48:13.303
Green meant you stayed.

48:13.958 --> 48:16.301
that was books that had circulated within two years.

48:17.002 --> 48:18.043
Oh, it's Africa-esque.

48:18.063 --> 48:19.104
Oh, it's horrible.

48:19.124 --> 48:20.166
Books are alive to me.

48:20.266 --> 48:20.706
I know.

48:20.766 --> 48:21.888
They are alive.

48:21.908 --> 48:35.985
I feel this very... Okay, so anything that didn't circulate in the last two years got a yellow tag, I believe, and stayed in the stacks.

48:36.566 --> 48:42.413
Anything that circulated that was older than that got sent to the Carlson stacks.

48:42.612 --> 48:49.382
Anything that was called an NOF or wasn't in the catalog, not on file.

48:49.883 --> 48:50.905
That makes a good point.

48:50.925 --> 48:51.906
Yes, okay.

48:52.227 --> 48:54.851
Then there were 800 boxes.

48:54.931 --> 48:56.754
I was corrected the other day.

48:56.894 --> 48:59.177
NOF equals DOA, basically.

48:59.197 --> 49:00.139
Yes, death camps.

49:00.159 --> 49:02.102
Except there are some that are coming back.

49:02.322 --> 49:03.304
Well, yes, there are a lot.

49:03.424 --> 49:10.695
Actually, we did get to save a lot, but those NOFs got sent up to the deselection chamber.

49:10.675 --> 49:12.137
The de-selection chamber.

49:12.157 --> 49:12.718
That's right.

49:12.738 --> 49:22.230
What became known as the de-selection chamber by then the humanities staff, because it was the responsibility... Where is the de-selection chamber?

49:22.250 --> 49:24.212
On the third floor of the old main library.

49:24.773 --> 49:26.736
The place that had the most earthquake damage.

49:26.756 --> 49:27.577
It was closed down.

49:27.597 --> 49:27.877
Right.

49:27.897 --> 49:30.120
And it was where the old chief... Who was doing the work in here?

49:30.140 --> 49:32.363
Who was doing this stuff?

49:32.613 --> 49:41.005
library staff and PIC workers, private industry council workers, plus volunteers to pick the books up off the floor.

49:41.025 --> 49:42.928
We got all the books picked up in our department.

49:42.948 --> 49:43.950
Sounds like a slot of houses.

49:43.970 --> 49:45.071
Well, yeah, it was.

49:45.111 --> 49:46.694
You know what I'm saying?

49:46.734 --> 49:48.496
Yeah, but that's what we felt.

49:48.516 --> 49:48.877
Yeah.

49:49.518 --> 49:54.285
So, you know, in our department... And the point was, let me just, one second.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.368
The stacks could have been mended.

49:56.468 --> 49:57.349
For how much?

49:57.469 --> 49:58.330
$30,000?

49:58.631 --> 50:01.455
I never, I didn't... We got all the books picked up in a week.

50:01.655 --> 50:10.424
We, as a library staff, you know, felt that the library could have been opened, you know, in November, three weeks after the earthquake.

50:10.444 --> 50:14.267
And see, the building was October 89, October 17.

50:14.307 --> 50:15.589
The building wasn't really damaged.

50:15.609 --> 50:18.471
It was just that some of the metal shelving was damaged.

50:18.491 --> 50:19.693
And that could have been.

50:19.713 --> 50:22.956
And there were broken light bulbs and maybe even cracks.

50:22.976 --> 50:23.156
Oh, yeah.

50:23.176 --> 50:24.397
I mean, you know, there was a little bit.

50:24.417 --> 50:25.518
And the shelves fell down.

50:25.538 --> 50:30.463
But the shelves, I mean, but the shelves, they got an estimate at one point that the shelves could have been fixed for, like,

50:30.916 --> 50:35.002
I don't know, $300,000 or $30,000, and they could have used FEMA money to do that.

50:35.163 --> 50:44.177
But Dallin said that because we were heading towards this new building in 1996, he didn't want to spend that money.

50:44.778 --> 50:55.995
But in fact, if he had had the interest, if he had been sort of methodical and had the interest of the collection at heart, public service at heart, he wouldn't have made all these changes so rapidly.

50:56.296 --> 51:08.229
And basically, also, it worked with advantages because it made the library so crowded and the collection so small that it made the new library look big and luxurious and lots of seats.

51:08.249 --> 51:13.515
So here's the original label.

51:13.735 --> 51:15.437
His vision becomes very clear to him.

51:17.079 --> 51:21.544
He is a man on the top of the world

51:21.743 --> 51:27.651
That earthquake was saved his, I mean, really, was a lucky thing that came along for him.

51:28.292 --> 51:30.095
It gave him the opportunity, the cover.

51:30.475 --> 51:30.976
That's right.

51:30.996 --> 51:32.498
It gave him cover to do it.

51:32.939 --> 51:34.020
Whatever he wanted.

51:34.041 --> 51:35.102
Whatever he wanted.

51:35.122 --> 51:40.209
Somebody said, I fail still to grasp.

51:40.229 --> 51:42.172
Is he expressing anybody's will?

51:42.312 --> 51:44.916
I mean, is this the creation of Ken Dowling?

51:45.048 --> 51:51.100
I think a lot of people... Did this city want this kind of a life?

51:51.120 --> 51:53.265
No, we wanted something modern, basically.

51:53.706 --> 51:56.271
We did need more space for books.

51:56.551 --> 51:58.135
That's how it got passed.

51:58.195 --> 52:00.058
And Kevin Steyer didn't want a new building.

52:00.319 --> 52:01.842
No, and neither did John France.

52:02.092 --> 52:06.198
And many other libraries that have built new buildings have combined it with the old buildings.

52:06.218 --> 52:09.303
Well, Boston is not an example.

52:09.323 --> 52:11.045
LA did it, too.

52:11.105 --> 52:13.429
I mean, you need that much space.

52:13.449 --> 52:18.236
This was partly the reason why John Franz had to leave.

52:18.717 --> 52:18.837
Right.

52:18.857 --> 52:19.598
That was partly the reason why.

52:19.618 --> 52:23.163
Well, we were responsible for getting rid of John Franz ostensibly.

52:23.203 --> 52:24.525
John, how do you spell his name?

52:24.565 --> 52:25.927
F-R-A-N-T-D.

52:26.087 --> 52:28.170
He just died this year.

52:28.211 --> 52:28.771
What was he?

52:28.811 --> 52:30.754
He was a previous city librarian.

52:30.814 --> 52:31.255
That's what he said.

52:32.247 --> 52:34.290
Job security at that job is not bad.

52:35.031 --> 52:35.873
What happened to start?

52:35.893 --> 52:37.235
Did he quit?

52:37.255 --> 52:38.396
Did he shift down?

52:38.697 --> 52:41.922
He wanted a sabbatical to write a book, is that it?

52:42.182 --> 52:46.809
And he's written some very fine books, by the way, those Oxford University Press books so familiar with them.

52:47.210 --> 52:50.475
Well, and I believe the mayor at the time said no, so...

52:50.995 --> 52:51.516
No, what?

52:51.756 --> 52:53.318
No, he could not take a leave.

52:53.559 --> 52:55.581
Oh, and so, but you would have to get that.

52:55.722 --> 52:58.465
He's very diplomatic on this tape about this thing.

52:58.485 --> 53:03.092
He admits that he opposed it, but maybe, you know, it's okay.

53:03.853 --> 53:06.677
And he also says there's great gaps in the collection.

53:08.239 --> 53:08.580
Anyway.

53:08.600 --> 53:18.133
Well, Dallin says that he thought, he knew that you couldn't close branches in San Francisco, and Dallin didn't know that, and that was another thing that made Dallin really...

53:18.637 --> 53:21.321
suspect early on is he immediately started to close branches.

53:21.381 --> 53:22.623
How many branches are closed?

53:22.643 --> 53:23.284
He never succeeded.

53:23.364 --> 53:27.090
He closed one because it wasn't a neighborhood, it was the business branch.

53:27.110 --> 53:31.437
And the business community is apparently still very unhappy about this.

53:31.457 --> 53:33.420
Oh, but they never came forward, though.

53:33.440 --> 53:34.321
How many branches?

53:34.341 --> 53:35.062
Well, 26.

53:36.084 --> 53:40.130
So he would always say that we need, you know, fewer, better, bigger branches.

53:40.330 --> 53:44.897
But the trouble is, people need branches that you can walk to and that you can, you know,

53:45.552 --> 53:46.973
It's like a public park.

53:47.073 --> 53:50.957
If you have small little public parks that are within two blocks of your house, they'll be heavily used.

53:50.977 --> 53:57.222
If all you have is one neighborhood park, but you have to walk 20 blocks to get to it, it'll be underutilized.

53:57.262 --> 54:06.570
So even if there's not as much information... The thing about Dowling, how Dowling got... I mean, Dowling was hired for his vision of technology.

54:06.590 --> 54:08.212
Right.

54:08.232 --> 54:10.994
The Library Commission... He simply reflected somebody's wants.

54:11.194 --> 54:11.634
Yes.

54:11.654 --> 54:14.597
Somebody on that Library Commission...

54:15.117 --> 54:22.143
is credited by James Chafee, who has followed this whole process for 22 years and knows it.

54:22.403 --> 54:28.068
I didn't get involved until 1989, so I know nothing about the Dallas election.

54:28.088 --> 54:33.493
But Chafee says that Marjorie Stern did not like the three candidates, I guess it was, that they came up with.

54:33.853 --> 54:39.438
And by the way, Regina Manudry was one of the applicants, we understand, for that job originally.

54:39.458 --> 54:43.842
And it would be interesting to find out from Colter and Regina,

54:44.395 --> 54:48.722
Why, is Coulter on this election for Dallas?

54:48.742 --> 54:48.883
No.

54:48.903 --> 54:52.148
Okay, for Regina, why she thinks she didn't get the job.

54:52.889 --> 55:01.824
But at any rate, Marjorie Stern, apparently they threw out the process, they didn't like the candidates, threw out the process, and somebody talked to Gary Strong, who was State Librarian.

55:02.345 --> 55:04.128
Yeah, and he was an old buddy of Dallas.

55:04.148 --> 55:05.470
He was a State Librarian at the time.

55:05.491 --> 55:05.691
Oh, right.

55:05.731 --> 55:06.612
State Librarian at the time.

55:06.673 --> 55:08.175
What did the State Librarian do?

55:09.117 --> 55:10.138
runs the state library.

55:10.278 --> 55:11.039
The bureaucracy.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.821
But what is the state library?

55:12.921 --> 55:14.103
We don't have one in Massachusetts.

55:14.123 --> 55:15.144
Oh, do you have one?

55:15.364 --> 55:16.486
There's a collection there.

55:16.646 --> 55:18.788
Oh, because they bought some public at the state library.

55:18.889 --> 55:20.791
I think you do.

55:21.271 --> 55:23.354
I mean, it's certainly nothing that we bought.

55:23.374 --> 55:25.256
They're like, they're the state, they, well.

55:25.276 --> 55:26.558
Like, yeah, for the state archives?

55:26.758 --> 55:28.880
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:28.900 --> 55:32.605
And they lend collections of Bourne books to small libraries.

55:32.625 --> 55:33.666
They do all sorts of things.

55:33.686 --> 55:37.150
Kevin goes around, and they do, they, they, they,

55:37.265 --> 55:39.442
We have hundreds of libraries.

55:39.543 --> 55:40.854
Every town.

55:40.894 --> 55:42.043
My little town has...

55:42.361 --> 55:43.763
It doesn't even have 7,000 people.

55:43.783 --> 55:46.988
It's got three libraries.

55:47.068 --> 55:48.170
I'm in North Grafton.

55:48.190 --> 55:49.111
There's one in North Grafton.

55:49.191 --> 55:54.018
It's right next to Worcester.

55:54.098 --> 55:56.442
Oh, yeah, Worcester.

55:56.802 --> 55:59.887
Five miles down the street, Shrewsbury's got a huge library.

56:00.087 --> 56:02.370
Some people think that's wasteful, but it's not wasteful.

56:02.411 --> 56:04.033
That's the way you get people to read.

56:04.153 --> 56:07.678
Dallin was hired for his vision.

56:07.758 --> 56:10.242
He's reading the book called The Electronic Library.

56:10.222 --> 56:12.585
He believed himself that we wanted him.

56:12.665 --> 56:14.367
Is it kind of like a mind comp?

56:14.387 --> 56:16.050
I mean, is the outline his vision in there?

56:16.070 --> 56:18.393
It's really almost unillegible.

56:18.453 --> 56:19.814
But here's the most challenging book.

56:19.834 --> 56:21.196
Yeah, it's illiterate.

56:21.356 --> 56:23.259
I mean, he misspelled consensus.

56:23.279 --> 56:24.761
Oh, no.

56:24.781 --> 56:26.023
Well, just read his website.

56:26.083 --> 56:27.104
It's totally misspelled.

56:27.124 --> 56:30.028
I went on it this morning for the first time, because I had that.

56:30.148 --> 56:35.034
If he says in the email to me, check my website.

56:35.054 --> 56:35.995
I'm surprised it's still up.

56:36.015 --> 56:39.520
I want to send him an email saying, you have...

56:39.803 --> 56:40.924
It's such gall.

56:41.305 --> 56:44.008
It's a campaign website.

56:44.048 --> 56:45.930
Well, he's winning for the ALA presidency?

56:45.990 --> 56:47.131
No, no, that's over.

56:47.211 --> 56:48.933
Nobody on the website is in there.

56:48.953 --> 56:49.794
That's what I mean.

56:49.814 --> 56:50.595
It should be down.

56:50.715 --> 56:51.356
It should be down.

56:51.376 --> 56:53.318
You know he lost by the biggest margin.

56:53.358 --> 56:54.579
I checked to see how he did.

56:54.779 --> 56:55.901
Wow.

56:57.042 --> 57:06.452
Apparently, you know, he went around the country in a bus or a van or something, and he was giving— I talked to a couple of librarians at ALA and other places about this, and he was, like, giving presents to people.

57:06.432 --> 57:11.352
But then he went, he'd go to give a speech, and everybody's like, I couldn't believe it.

57:11.372 --> 57:11.693
It's so boring.

57:11.713 --> 57:12.055
It's so bad.

57:12.215 --> 57:13.641
Well, he talks about...

57:14.009 --> 57:19.319
Did you read the thing, his goals?

57:19.760 --> 57:24.288
Yeah, he claims that he's a book person.

57:24.308 --> 57:27.013
Okay, now, what was what we just saw?

57:27.033 --> 57:28.115
I don't know, I'm just saying it.

57:28.135 --> 57:34.427
Well, maybe he's learned his lesson, because people used to tell John Barry that he's learned his lesson about closing branches, so maybe he changed it.

57:34.728 --> 57:37.553
You can't say you're against books.

57:37.533 --> 57:44.181
The quote from the book is something like this.

57:44.321 --> 57:52.630
The common wisdom has it said that you should have a strong children's children in the library because you'll get, you know.

57:52.650 --> 57:59.338
But in fact, she said, but in fact, if those children, they'll grow up, they'll move away because we have a very multiple society.

57:59.588 --> 58:01.270
So they won't use your library.

58:01.290 --> 58:04.074
So it doesn't make sense to have a strong children's program.

58:04.094 --> 58:05.877
You should have a newcomer's program instead.

58:06.137 --> 58:06.758
He said this?

58:07.158 --> 58:07.799
Yeah.

58:07.839 --> 58:12.486
Well, that's, I mean, you know, maybe it sounded slightly better than that, right, in terms of, you know, the logic of it.

58:12.766 --> 58:16.631
But the idea is that, yes, we, I mean, he's so narrow-minded.

58:16.651 --> 58:19.655
He's only looking at this pie and not literally.

58:19.675 --> 58:23.841
Well, he's so, you know, self-serving.

58:24.158 --> 58:37.958
He says books used to be scarce, libraries used to be scarce, and education used to be scarce.

58:37.978 --> 58:39.680
None of those things is true anymore.

58:39.700 --> 58:44.327
There are lots of books, lots of publishers, there's lots of libraries, there's corporate libraries,

58:44.695 --> 58:47.540
There's private libraries, there's university libraries, you know.

58:47.861 --> 58:49.003
And education isn't scarce.

58:49.023 --> 58:50.506
There's lots of community colleges.

58:50.787 --> 58:51.688
We didn't used to have those.

58:51.708 --> 58:54.734
There's lots of universities and extension courses.

58:54.995 --> 58:59.904
So we don't need to serve those needs anymore for having lots of books.

58:59.924 --> 59:02.569
You don't have to be a library and you don't have to have an educational function.

59:02.870 --> 59:05.092
And what you need to do is focus on information.

59:05.112 --> 59:05.372
Right.

59:05.713 --> 59:08.275
And no, don't focus on content anymore.

59:08.435 --> 59:13.580
And now he says, yeah, don't focus, that the library is interested in access, not content.

59:13.620 --> 59:20.627
In a recent issue of American Libraries, he said, you know, when he said something, librarians have to focus on access, not content.

59:20.948 --> 59:24.531
And this is the same thing with the dumbing down of, like, not having subject needs.

59:24.551 --> 59:28.675
He basically, he doesn't really understand that in order to use a library,

59:29.212 --> 59:44.989
You try to make it as self-service as possible, but most people are really, many people are not going to find what they want, especially in a subject search, unless they really know how to use a catalog, and it's a really good catalog, and unless they get help, and it has to be well organized.

59:45.049 --> 59:53.437
Yes, Barbara Cuthman, or Virginia Woolford, or Shaw, the libraries are supposed to have content.

59:53.457 --> 59:54.999
That's where they did all of their work.

59:56.441 --> 59:58.763
It was Ken Calpenter telling a wonderful story.

59:59.148 --> 01:00:01.231
about, you know.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:07.459
You know, you're supposed to be able to go into the library and be anonymous and get your work done.

01:00:07.519 --> 01:00:13.627
Librarians are helpful and help, you know, help you find what you're looking for.

01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:16.150
And by serendipity and librarians help, that's it.

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:27.585
But see, what Kent's vision, I think, really was, and he talks about this in the book, that money for libraries was going to dry up because the public sector, everybody hates government and public sector is going to dry up and look at Prop 13 and everything.

01:00:27.818 --> 01:00:30.041
So the library had to find new ways of finding itself.

01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:31.544
So you have to pay for information.

01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:37.913
You have to find a way to ingratiate yourself with government and business and get them to pay you for your stuff.

01:00:38.254 --> 01:00:52.155
So his idea was things like have all of the records of the city government, you know.
