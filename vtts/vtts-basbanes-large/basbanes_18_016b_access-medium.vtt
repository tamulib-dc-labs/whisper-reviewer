No, but Peter sent you the stuff, right?

00:03.767 --> 00:05.409
Yeah, oh yeah, I got stuff.

00:05.469 --> 00:10.034
And if you have any questions after you see the July issue, give me.

00:10.054 --> 00:13.698
I just got this assignment this morning, and they want it tomorrow.

00:14.619 --> 00:15.320
And that's no problem.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.582
I'll be here tomorrow, so if you have any questions.

00:17.602 --> 00:21.907
And I'll work on it tonight, and we'll have a nice piece, and you'll see it this weekend.

00:21.927 --> 00:23.008
Okay, nice to talk to you.

00:23.028 --> 00:23.949
Thanks very much for your time.

00:23.989 --> 00:24.570
Appreciate it.
