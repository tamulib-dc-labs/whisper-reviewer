WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:09.107
And I don't remember where you were, but this is all good stuff.

00:09.988 --> 00:13.911
The pub date of your book is March 17th, and that's the date I hope to have this.

00:13.931 --> 00:14.492
It's a Sunday.

00:14.512 --> 00:18.556
It works perfectly because most of the papers that take me run it on Sunday.

00:19.076 --> 00:21.598
So I'm going to move it to run on St.

00:21.638 --> 00:22.359
Patrick's Day.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.061
And now you have a great St.

00:24.081 --> 00:25.242
Patrick's Day custom.

00:25.262 --> 00:27.123
Are you continuing to follow that?

00:27.164 --> 00:27.624
Oh, sure.

00:27.924 --> 00:29.886
I'm going to...

00:30.608 --> 00:32.450
be the host of that event.

00:34.192 --> 00:42.882
I assume this is my last one, because the hosting is traditionally done by the senator from the district.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.204
And I'm no longer the senator.

00:45.504 --> 00:52.232
But there is no senator, so I have a chance to... So you say, did you plan these things pretty much in advance?

00:52.252 --> 00:59.460
I mean, or is there... Do you plan what you're going to say, or is there a lot of... Spontaneous?

00:59.520 --> 00:59.620
Yeah.

01:00.663 --> 01:05.752
Although the governor right now, who really enjoys this... It's amazing, isn't it?

01:05.772 --> 01:06.714
He's getting ready now.

01:06.955 --> 01:08.978
You're talking about Massachusetts politics.

01:09.780 --> 01:10.962
Oh, he loves this stuff.

01:10.982 --> 01:11.102
Yeah.

01:11.783 --> 01:12.966
He's a big kid about it.

01:13.266 --> 01:17.534
I mean, tell me a little bit about this appointment from the incumbent governor.

01:17.574 --> 01:21.321
Well, it was by his board, but the governor's...

01:23.073 --> 01:28.360
And we're talking about, for my national audience, we're talking about a Republican white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

01:28.480 --> 01:34.067
A Republican governor who's, you know, I refer to as Forrest Gump.

01:35.409 --> 01:38.253
Or Mr. Magoo because everything just turns out right there.

01:39.775 --> 01:47.865
He's one of those guys that we usually, you know, express our gratitude to because they're, you know, allowing us to use their country.

01:48.892 --> 02:03.316
And he also, this is to his everlasting credit, when I have actually called him to say, you know, I think I cut you very hard there at the banquet last night or something, or the St.

02:03.376 --> 02:04.258
Patrick's Day thing.

02:04.418 --> 02:07.102
I hope it wasn't too much.

02:08.745 --> 02:14.815
And Weld has said to me, look, don't start that stuff.

02:15.520 --> 02:21.960
He says, if you're going to get so, you know, careful, you're going to take all the fun out of this business.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.547
That's a pretty good attitude, isn't it?

02:24.567 --> 02:25.671
It is a perfect attitude.

02:25.811 --> 02:26.032
Yeah.

02:26.172 --> 02:28.078
And so you...

02:28.649 --> 02:31.233
Look how he became friendly with Silver, for God's sakes.

02:31.794 --> 02:34.097
Will is a real nice guy.

02:34.117 --> 02:35.640
I mean, I enjoy working with him.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.684
His politics, of course, is some good disagreement.

02:38.704 --> 02:40.327
Oh, I would think so, yeah.

02:40.647 --> 02:42.209
But he's a great man, I think.

02:42.290 --> 02:45.474
But, I mean, only in Massachusetts would you get this kind of a situation.

02:45.494 --> 02:46.917
I mean, would you agree with that?

02:47.017 --> 02:48.439
Oh, yeah.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.522
I think we have...

02:51.683 --> 03:03.340
Oh, he's... I mean, where his... I mean, the disappointment, I realize, it came through his board, but it certainly doesn't come without his... Yeah, he was favorably disposed.

03:03.360 --> 03:03.480
Right.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.261
There's no question.

03:04.562 --> 03:10.891
And how about your decision, finally, to step down and to... Well, I just... I mean, that's 35 years.

03:12.033 --> 03:13.916
I mean, I was in extra innings.

03:13.936 --> 03:17.481
I enjoyed the presidency.

03:18.342 --> 03:18.923
And...

03:20.742 --> 03:21.383
I don't know.

03:21.443 --> 03:23.224
It just came.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.165
The time came.

03:24.265 --> 03:25.767
And I could feel that this was the time.

03:27.889 --> 03:29.871
It's nice to go out as a winner, too, isn't it?

03:29.891 --> 03:30.191
It is.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.274
And the manner of leaving, I guess, is important.

03:33.895 --> 03:38.760
And the last five years, I have to tell you, was very enjoyable.

03:39.781 --> 03:49.450
And we brought a new kind of, you know, a return of stability so that the state is up and, you know, running much better right now than it was.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.192
only a short while ago.

03:53.293 --> 04:02.365
Much of the state's problem was due to the downturn in the national economy, you know, the international economy.

04:02.385 --> 04:17.125
So it wasn't the fault of everyone, but in order to have the big tightening up and the rest, why we had to work together, squabbling with the governor by the Democratic legislature would have been exactly the wrong thing.

04:18.807 --> 04:19.268
And, uh,

04:19.619 --> 04:34.101
Furthermore, I think people really don't understand why are these people always fighting when they should know we have a common problem and we should be seeking to solve it together.

04:34.790 --> 04:40.597
What do you think that the common perception of the Massachusetts legislature is?

04:40.918 --> 04:46.645
I think legislatures are always held in a low regard, unfortunately.

04:47.646 --> 04:51.050
And, of course, the individuals are okay.

04:53.213 --> 04:55.075
And how about the general performance?

04:55.356 --> 04:59.601
I think the performance has been good in the past several years.

04:59.641 --> 05:04.527
I enjoyed working with Speaker Flaherty.

05:06.211 --> 05:10.957
on the other side, and I think it went reasonably well.

05:11.718 --> 05:20.410
And how about your hopes for generalities now for your work with the University of Massachusetts?

05:20.430 --> 05:22.472
I like the university very much.

05:23.133 --> 05:26.438
It's really a great jewel on the crown of this state.

05:27.219 --> 05:31.965
It's not as greatly appreciated here in Massachusetts as it should be.

05:34.004 --> 05:46.020
And I think the reason lies in the fact that we have so many star-studded private universities, like, say, Michigan.

05:48.163 --> 05:55.793
And also there is a need for the tightening up of some standards at the university, and we're addressing that now.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.513
So, in sum, you've had a good ride.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.194
Oh, sure.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.096
And you've enjoyed it.

06:04.097 --> 06:16.751
Yeah, I feel as though I was fortunate enough to be doing things that counted, you know, a little bit beyond a more selfish purpose, I think.

06:17.292 --> 06:17.612
I hope.

06:18.093 --> 06:19.614
You know, I always wonder about that.

06:19.755 --> 06:26.202
It deserves a full essay about, well, aren't you satisfying, really, some desire?

06:26.890 --> 06:29.214
But you like to think it's a little more unselfish.

06:29.895 --> 06:38.230
And maybe if you could just think of accomplishments that are most satisfying and maybe things that are the most frustrating.

06:38.450 --> 06:41.355
You do mention something towards the end about an amendment you wanted to...

06:41.774 --> 06:53.246
Yeah, well, one little thing was the Procio School thing because in Massachusetts it's so restrictive that it's unfair.

06:54.427 --> 07:00.533
But the public school unions are exceedingly powerful here and very difficult.

07:00.954 --> 07:07.901
They feel threatened by the lowly, poorly financed Procio School.

07:08.201 --> 07:10.684
They really should not, but they do.

07:11.693 --> 07:16.178
That would have been something to have accomplished.

07:16.398 --> 07:25.868
I think I'd like to have seen the Convention Center expanded sooner, because that's a particularly important thing.

07:25.888 --> 07:28.451
And I don't see any argument against it, unfortunately.

07:29.172 --> 07:37.040
That was one of those small points of disagreement, or small point, well, one of those few areas of disagreement between Speaker Flaherty and me.

07:38.902 --> 07:41.245
He didn't see the need for it, apparently.

07:41.461 --> 07:41.942
I did.

07:42.202 --> 07:45.947
I managed to get it through the Senate, but I couldn't move it in the House.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.431
There are things like that.

07:49.272 --> 07:57.784
And then, of course, the accomplishments that you're particularly proud of, that you might spring to mind.

07:58.205 --> 08:06.777
Well, I feel pleased that I was able to push through some school choice legislation.

08:08.545 --> 08:23.749
so that people of modest means have the kind of choice within their public school system that is available to people who are more affluent.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.413
We have some charter schools now going online.

08:26.933 --> 08:27.955
Some are underway.

08:28.795 --> 08:30.597
And this is very beneficial.

08:30.877 --> 08:36.443
These are public schools, actually, but they are kind of split off and they become a little more independent.

08:37.004 --> 08:42.129
The superintendent of the school, the principal of the school, is running it.

08:43.150 --> 08:54.702
They're out from under some of the more difficult strictures of the schools in the system.

08:55.424 --> 09:02.273
And I feel good about that because I think the importance of education can't be overstated.

09:02.634 --> 09:04.396
Even a little bit of it is valuable.

09:05.858 --> 09:23.361
And so wherever people want to come together, if they want to do so, and even if everything else is failing, those who wish to do so should be able to find some place where they can have the experience of learning.

09:23.822 --> 09:24.503
I believe that

09:26.052 --> 09:31.918
like yourself, that learning and education is a lifelong process.

09:32.399 --> 09:35.262
I don't think it's something that someone else does for you.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.666
They help you, but they don't do it for you.

09:39.727 --> 09:55.384
I think the fundamental idea of it is to develop the, especially in those K through 12 times, develop the peculiarly human attributes, the ability to read and to write

09:55.820 --> 09:56.401
and to think.

09:58.724 --> 09:59.185
That's good stuff.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.049
Let me just think if there's anything else.

10:02.289 --> 10:10.641
Obviously, I'm going to go looking for this book here.

10:10.741 --> 10:11.442
Well, my book.

10:11.582 --> 10:13.725
A Gentle Madness.

10:13.825 --> 10:15.347
It's published by Holt.

10:15.968 --> 10:21.396
It's 638 pages, and it's all about the passion for books.

10:21.456 --> 10:28.305
The subtitle is Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

10:29.447 --> 10:32.190
And it's half history and half contemporary stuff.

10:32.210 --> 10:34.073
You know, there's a great favorite of mine, Nick.

10:34.093 --> 10:35.135
I am interrupting you.

10:35.195 --> 10:35.856
Forgive me for it.

10:35.896 --> 10:36.496
That's fine.

10:36.536 --> 10:43.446
You're probably bursting with things to say about your own... No, that's... I'm such an ego maniac a little.

10:43.466 --> 10:44.187
But...

10:45.247 --> 10:46.209
Samuel Johnson.

10:47.431 --> 10:48.332
I really like him.

10:49.614 --> 10:56.966
Johnson was a very good man, and probably he didn't produce as much writing as he should have, but he was a very wise fellow.

10:58.028 --> 11:04.539
And as you know, Boswell chronicled his life very, well, classically, huh?

11:05.340 --> 11:05.841
Wonderful.

11:05.861 --> 11:07.143
Boswell's life of Johnson.

11:07.183 --> 11:09.527
Well, it's brilliant, yeah.

11:10.349 --> 11:11.170
But Johnson had a

11:12.938 --> 11:30.028
I actually went, I took the train, I went up, took the train to his birthplace in Litchfield, in England one time, and then had lunch with a fellow named John Wayne, taught at Oxford, who had done a life of Dr. Johnson.

11:30.528 --> 11:32.312
But Johnson was really a nice guy.

11:32.332 --> 11:34.175
I know Wayne's book, W-A-I-N.

11:34.195 --> 11:34.896
Exactly, yeah.

11:35.467 --> 11:38.753
I've got a great Johnson anecdote in my book.

11:39.614 --> 11:47.167
He worked for a famous but rather dull-witted bookseller by the name of Thomas Osborne III.

11:47.187 --> 11:51.014
And he did some translations for him and stuff.

11:51.034 --> 11:53.198
And Osborne was giving him a hard time one day.

11:53.238 --> 11:54.420
It's a true story.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.124
documented and everything by Boswell and others.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.610
And he was berating young Johnson and Johnson got so angry with him.

12:01.630 --> 12:15.570
He was working on his folio and picked it up and threw it at the guy, knocked him on his butt, got up, stood on him, stood over him, put his foot on his chest and said, lie there, thou son of ignorance, obscurity and despair.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.634
Wonderful lie.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.096
That's in my book.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.800
That's my Samuel Johnson anecdote.

12:22.820 --> 12:23.361
It's a

12:23.341 --> 12:24.262
Great story.

12:24.903 --> 12:27.307
You can use Johnson for so many good quotes.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.389
Can I tell you one I use?

12:28.489 --> 12:30.472
Oh, please, yeah.

12:31.654 --> 12:32.935
Don't use this.

12:32.956 --> 12:34.558
No, no, this is this.

12:35.299 --> 12:39.405
I told Mifflin, they had paid me half my money.

12:40.347 --> 12:41.388
I'm working my head off.

12:41.408 --> 12:45.214
I just thought I was the hardest working little guy in the United States.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.890
So I needed the rest of my money.

12:48.171 --> 12:50.034
I thought I had earned it.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.860
Only when you deliver the manuscripts, right?

12:54.220 --> 12:55.683
Anyway, it was slow coming.

12:56.223 --> 13:00.330
And I said, Dr. Johnson said that only a block had rights for anything except money.

13:01.091 --> 13:01.752
Well, that's right.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.295
Listen, my book came out in July.

13:03.355 --> 13:06.960
It's into its fourth printing.

13:07.141 --> 13:07.842
Oh, great.

13:07.862 --> 13:12.108
It's got 50,000 copies in print, picked up by Book of the Month Club, all these others.

13:12.128 --> 13:13.851
I still haven't got a royalty check.

13:13.831 --> 13:16.254
I'm finally getting paid next month.

13:16.274 --> 13:18.797
I mean, we've got two kids here, you know?

13:18.817 --> 13:19.477
Oh, yeah.

13:19.497 --> 13:21.319
Isn't that great?

13:21.339 --> 13:22.200
I don't even know.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.922
You know, I'm sorry about that.

13:24.082 --> 13:25.924
Well, it's just the way it is, and you live with it.

13:26.085 --> 13:31.250
And they hold back 50% as a hedge against returns, and there aren't any returns of my book.

13:32.131 --> 13:36.356
But anyway, I just sold on my next book, which will be another celebration of books.

13:36.917 --> 13:37.898
Is that right?

13:37.938 --> 13:38.819
Books are my passion.

13:38.839 --> 13:39.279
That's what I do.

13:39.299 --> 13:40.020
Isn't that great?

13:41.041 --> 13:42.623
I was a very lucky guy.

13:43.463 --> 13:44.424
began to read.

13:45.765 --> 13:46.666
Well, tell me about that.

13:46.806 --> 13:50.570
One little thing, I had a wonderful priest, Father Carl Thayer.

13:52.172 --> 13:53.734
Carl was a bit of an eccentric.

13:53.754 --> 13:56.156
He never left the campus at Boston College.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.078
But he taught me Greek.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.402
And he taught a couple of my children Greek.

14:02.483 --> 14:06.307
And in ancient Greek, you really, I mean, what's written in ancient Greek?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.269
Because I'm a good Greek from Lowell, you know.

14:08.289 --> 14:08.869
Oh, yeah.

14:08.930 --> 14:09.991
That's my background.

14:10.711 --> 14:11.312
Yeah.

14:11.332 --> 14:13.234
Go ahead.

14:13.754 --> 14:19.540
When poor Michael said to me, Duke, I said, you get along so well with those ancient Greeks, what's wrong with us?

14:19.560 --> 14:21.442
I said, where do you want to start, Michael?

14:21.742 --> 14:26.707
I said, the ancient ones don't talk back, you modern ones.

14:27.188 --> 14:33.854
But anyway, this is... Well, he just became Greek when he ran for president anyway, so I'm going to complain to some of us, but I'm sorry.

14:33.994 --> 14:42.563
Well, anyway, Kyle Thayer loved the Greek, and so he got me fired up on it.

14:42.813 --> 14:53.209
I went away between my first freshman year and sophomore year to go to the Army just to get the GI Bill.

14:53.469 --> 14:56.514
And when I came back, he says, you're probably better off not coming back to this stuff.

14:56.534 --> 14:58.177
He says, it's hard to get back into it.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.722
And I said, oh, why don't I do it just one more year, Father?

15:01.802 --> 15:02.844
I always liked it.

15:03.004 --> 15:03.665
And so I did.

15:03.845 --> 15:05.468
He always liked it, the fact that I did.

15:06.529 --> 15:10.255
Well, he and I, for years and years,

15:12.142 --> 15:14.765
We would meet at least once a month.

15:15.406 --> 15:23.396
I'd have dinner with him at the refectory at Boston College downstairs in the priests out of St.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.077
Mary's Hall.

15:25.298 --> 15:28.142
And we'd chat, and I'd say hello to the other Jesuits.

15:28.643 --> 15:33.789
And then I'd go to his room where he had two desks that are facing each other.

15:34.971 --> 15:40.157
And I wasn't fully aware of it, but he, Carl, was always really giving me a...

15:42.449 --> 15:47.414
guiding my self-education, if you will, post-graduate.

15:48.956 --> 15:53.520
And if you were enjoying Dr. Johnson, I'd be interested in Dr. Johnson.

15:53.540 --> 15:54.501
And we'd talk about it.

15:55.943 --> 16:06.894
And then whatever the subject matter might be, whatever the books he was reading, I'd go back and read it.

16:06.994 --> 16:10.718
And he was in the habit of re-reading

16:11.407 --> 16:19.347
So we would read Shakespeare or whatever, Dickens, whatever he was reading.

16:19.467 --> 16:22.815
I'd sort of be guided by that and kind of keep pace with him.

16:24.941 --> 16:28.690
I don't think he ever watched an hour of television in his life.

16:29.902 --> 16:31.926
Do you collect books at all?

16:32.286 --> 16:37.075
Not very... But you more or less have a reading library and a reference library, I guess.

16:37.396 --> 16:37.536
I do.

16:38.918 --> 16:49.237
Obviously, you haven't been soured by politics because you have a son, and you obviously haven't tried to dissuade him from entering it.

16:49.257 --> 16:54.306
I wouldn't dare because I always fear that whole thing about his coming back to me later, saying,

16:55.737 --> 16:57.059
had you not dissuaded me.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.723
So I do kind of stand aside.

17:00.103 --> 17:04.229
He's 34, so... But what would your advice be if asked?

17:04.990 --> 17:10.759
If not necessarily by your son, but by any young person saying to you... Well, I'd say we... Politics needs you.

17:12.021 --> 17:19.431
If you're... But you have to put up with more than you can ever expect.

17:20.593 --> 17:22.015
And you're...

17:22.315 --> 17:37.610
You're also a means by that time of someone else furthering his career, if you can do your damage, whether through journalism or even through officialdom.

17:38.190 --> 17:49.521
People who can say, aha, I, you know, have uncovered some character flaw here.

17:51.458 --> 17:57.627
And it becomes very perilous because ambition lies all over the place.

17:58.889 --> 18:00.491
And you don't have much defense anymore.

18:02.474 --> 18:05.578
Nobody uses any self-restraint in how they treat you.

18:06.039 --> 18:09.744
But you knew from the earliest age, didn't you, that you wanted to go into this?

18:09.845 --> 18:10.766
I always liked it, yeah.

18:10.806 --> 18:11.767
And what was there about it?

18:11.908 --> 18:12.609
How old?

18:13.249 --> 18:14.071
I'm sorry, once again?

18:14.091 --> 18:15.052
Did you ask me how old?

18:15.332 --> 18:19.879
No, no, I said, what was there about politics that so captured you, I wonder?

18:20.585 --> 18:22.547
At such an early age.

18:22.567 --> 18:26.531
I liked the very earliest.

18:28.332 --> 18:32.316
I had a little flair for it from high school.

18:32.396 --> 18:33.557
I liked to read about it.

18:33.978 --> 18:40.243
I remember reading The Purple Shamrock, a biography of James Michael Curley.

18:40.263 --> 18:43.466
I can remember reading You're the Boss.

18:44.667 --> 18:45.368
And that was the name.

18:45.388 --> 18:49.512
It was a book written by one Edward Flynn, who was in the Bronx at the time.

18:50.470 --> 18:56.437
Behind the Ballots was a book written by James Farley.

18:57.658 --> 19:02.063
And then even with Father Thayer, Carl Thayer loved Demosthenes.

19:03.745 --> 19:05.807
And Demosthenes was an action person.

19:07.088 --> 19:13.255
And Carl liked those people who were... Oh, yeah.

19:16.745 --> 19:18.988
If you have to go, we've got plenty of stuff, by the way.

19:19.028 --> 19:19.209
What?

19:19.810 --> 19:22.333
If you have to go, let me know, because we've got plenty of stuff.

19:22.353 --> 19:30.986
I just wanted to tell you, though, Carl was more than he would have realized influential, too, because he liked that.

19:31.206 --> 19:34.211
He didn't have much patience for the philosophers.

19:36.334 --> 19:45.688
And he loved Socrates, and we'd translate Socrates, and he thought Socrates is a man, of course, of enormously wonderful principle.

19:46.698 --> 19:51.845
and a very good man, a gadfly there in Athens.

19:51.865 --> 19:52.826
To say the least.

19:52.846 --> 19:55.670
He nevertheless liked Demosthenes.

19:55.730 --> 20:02.479
He thought that Demosthenes had been the, oh, a good politician.

20:03.160 --> 20:12.032
It was Demosthenes who warned that Philip was in the north looking with greedy eyes toward Athens.

20:13.234 --> 20:16.198
And it was Demosthenes who in the crown oration

20:17.140 --> 20:22.025
had to defend himself against a villainous fellow, Escanese.

20:22.926 --> 20:26.590
And he had a brilliant speech.

20:27.311 --> 20:35.860
And by the way, even there, when I read that, so help me, I knew something about the nature of news.

20:36.540 --> 20:41.105
Demosthenes begins the speech with this brilliant observation.

20:41.285 --> 20:44.869
And this is really perhaps the greatest of all speeches, the crown orations.

20:46.283 --> 20:48.105
He says to him, well, you have listened.

20:49.346 --> 20:54.932
And you paid very close attention to Escanese as he has spoken of me.

20:55.973 --> 20:58.095
And it has been fascinating for you.

21:01.058 --> 21:04.982
Because men have always had an ear for gossip and effective.

21:07.084 --> 21:08.846
And now it falls to me.

21:11.809 --> 21:14.191
To do something I must do because of the circumstances.

21:14.211 --> 21:15.953
Tell you what a good man I am.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.693
And no one is interested in that.

21:20.855 --> 21:21.636
Isn't that good?

21:21.857 --> 21:22.037
Yeah.

21:22.097 --> 21:27.145
I mean, doesn't it tell you exactly what we're talking about when we say, what sells the newspaper?

21:27.165 --> 21:27.586
I know it.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.032
Well, times change, but human nature stays the same, I think.

21:31.052 --> 21:31.853
Oh, see, you're a Greek.

21:31.933 --> 21:36.741
You know, your good friend Thucydides is a great first historian.

21:37.062 --> 21:37.823
Thucydides said...

21:38.528 --> 21:41.712
The one constant of all human history is human nature.

21:41.772 --> 21:42.333
That's right.

21:42.353 --> 21:43.615
It doesn't change, really.

21:43.675 --> 21:46.939
Which is why Shakespeare loses none of his resonance.

21:47.200 --> 21:47.480
Right.

21:47.620 --> 21:51.826
That's why guys like you write about books, and you're interested in books, because you know.

21:52.346 --> 21:53.027
It's all there.

21:53.268 --> 21:53.949
It's all there.

21:54.069 --> 22:01.819
But Carl used to be so extreme, he'd say, look, if you know the ancient Greeks, you don't have to know anyone.

22:02.727 --> 22:07.636
Well, I would take my, if I had to go on an island, I would take my Shakespeare with me, too.

22:07.656 --> 22:08.077
You would, of course.

22:08.097 --> 22:08.759
Yeah, I'd have to.

22:09.260 --> 22:20.441
I have a wonderful chapter on the Greeks at Alexandria, and, you know, how the goal was to gather all the world's knowledge under one roof, and damn it, they did.

22:20.662 --> 22:22.906
I mean, they absolutely tried.

22:23.667 --> 22:25.090
Of course, they had this big...

22:25.070 --> 22:28.714
competition with Pergamum and wonderful stuff.

22:29.094 --> 22:31.397
Well, I hope you... Sorry to talk too much, Nick.

22:31.437 --> 22:31.737
Thanks a lot.

22:31.757 --> 22:49.457
Listen, we've done an hour, and I've got tons of stuff, and it will start appearing next Wednesday in Worcester, next weekend, and the Patriot Ledger takes me, so it'll be in the Patriot Ledger next weekend, and all my other papers will move it, and nice reviews on the book, if you don't mind one little guy.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.743
from UMass.

22:55.424 --> 22:58.567
His name is Quitt, Q-U-I-T-T.

22:59.848 --> 23:02.491
And he says, you make me so envious.

23:03.011 --> 23:05.093
He says, I grew up in South Framingham.

23:05.113 --> 23:16.304
He says, the only thing that I can remember with, you know, the only thing exciting that I can remember is that the marathon came through once a year.

23:16.324 --> 23:17.085
Well, that's something.

23:17.666 --> 23:18.887
Yeah, and then he says,

23:19.593 --> 23:22.037
I also have a new definition for chutzpah.

23:22.097 --> 23:22.758
That's what made it.

23:24.681 --> 23:28.146
He says, it's you and that lockover story.

23:28.306 --> 23:28.567
That's funny.

23:29.087 --> 23:29.809
That's cute.

23:29.849 --> 23:32.232
And he just enjoyed it.

23:32.252 --> 23:33.614
He said, I couldn't put that thing down.

23:33.654 --> 23:34.476
No, it's good.

23:34.556 --> 23:40.224
Boy, you got some nice blurbs from Doris Goodwin and David McCullough.

23:40.565 --> 23:42.608
These are people I really respect, you know.

23:42.888 --> 23:48.537
And I asked them to put the saboteau in, the quote, because Larry Saboteau, you know, he... Right.

23:49.293 --> 23:49.974
There you go.

23:50.094 --> 23:50.534
You know why?

23:50.994 --> 23:55.518
Because he made me wish I was, you know, born Irish.

23:55.759 --> 23:56.239
Great, yeah.

23:56.459 --> 23:57.660
I thought that was kind of funny.

23:58.441 --> 23:59.482
Anyway, you're a good listener.

23:59.522 --> 24:03.405
Well, listen, thank you very, very much, and I hope we have a chance to shake hands someday.

24:03.906 --> 24:04.546
Remember this, Nick.

24:04.987 --> 24:08.970
It's only because we were talking about my favorite subject, myself.

24:09.631 --> 24:10.151
There you go.

24:11.513 --> 24:12.994
That might be the kicker to my piece.

24:14.575 --> 24:15.076
Okay.

24:15.096 --> 24:15.576
We'll see you.

24:15.596 --> 24:16.797
Thank you very much, and good luck.

24:17.638 --> 24:17.798
Bye-bye.
