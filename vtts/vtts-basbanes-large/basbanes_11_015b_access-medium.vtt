WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:12.756
And what about duplicates of Aldine?

00:12.776 --> 00:32.276
I mean, would that... there'd be so many different titles, but you might have two... Well, with these ancient books, it's difficult to say what is a duplicate, because most of them have, for instance, notations and, you know, and other signs, or even handwriting.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.818
The owners have written

00:34.102 --> 00:36.545
made comments.

00:36.605 --> 00:39.128
So, in fact, they are not really duplicates.

00:39.148 --> 00:40.951
In that case, they are all originals.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.656
I think it's hard to argue that any incurable is a duplicate.

00:44.676 --> 00:46.678
Yes, not really, no.

00:48.781 --> 00:59.915
But also because of these collections sometimes were kept as the... for philological reasons.

01:00.015 --> 01:03.720
When we get a collection, an entire library,

01:04.072 --> 01:09.039
from somewhere else, then we do not disperse this.

01:09.059 --> 01:20.734
It's not a, it's left as a library, especially if it's an old, an ancient library, a historical library, consisting of many hundreds of thousands of books.

01:21.655 --> 01:24.920
Then it's not dismantled.

01:24.940 --> 01:28.124
So that's why you have, like, the Barberini collection, lots of them in the cagey.

01:28.144 --> 01:28.544
That's right.

01:28.565 --> 01:33.471
The Barberini, the Rossiana, the Mai, but also the De Luca.

01:33.788 --> 01:39.717
um, many other modern, more modern, uh, collections.

01:40.478 --> 01:43.021
So, those are always left intact, you would know?

01:43.041 --> 01:43.863
They're left intact, yes.

01:44.043 --> 01:52.575
So, even if they are dupictures, they are not, uh, they cannot be, um... The accession?

01:52.595 --> 01:53.837
The accession, yes.

01:53.857 --> 01:57.563
Oh, that's fascinating.

01:57.683 --> 01:58.564
That's unusual.

01:59.911 --> 02:10.360
My mother wasn't really like that.

02:10.677 --> 02:22.337
I wanted the license to give him a manuscript from another collection.

02:22.598 --> 02:23.760
That's why Dr. Berg left.

02:23.780 --> 02:30.812
There could be no deaccession of any of the original books in the collection because he was a trustee.

02:31.687 --> 02:38.857
the library, and he didn't appear that his chap wanted a manuscript or something.

02:38.997 --> 02:40.278
In return?

02:40.298 --> 02:42.601
Yeah, and it didn't like that.

02:42.622 --> 02:47.969
I really wanted his stuff to fall and stay empty.

02:49.811 --> 02:52.374
The history and the integrity.

02:55.899 --> 02:57.762
And the integrity, yes.

02:57.782 --> 02:58.082
Ah, yes.

02:59.260 --> 03:07.308
Oh, that was good.

03:07.328 --> 03:15.076
Yeah, I'll do it.

03:15.096 --> 03:15.597
Can I hold this next one?

03:15.617 --> 03:23.385
Thank you, Mom.

03:23.405 --> 03:23.765
You can hold this.

03:23.785 --> 03:24.046
Oh, I'm back.

03:24.066 --> 03:24.286
Here we go.

03:24.306 --> 03:24.526
Here we go.

03:24.546 --> 03:24.906
Here we go.

03:24.926 --> 03:25.147
Here we go.

03:25.167 --> 03:25.487
Here we go.

03:39.794 --> 03:57.735
I hope you will be able to use the computer.

03:57.935 --> 04:20.128
Perhaps it's actually better for the consideration of the book that you can have a computer that you don't risk that somebody starts writing over with a pen on top of the books.

04:28.698 --> 04:41.509
especially if they can use their computer terminals, then we don't have to try to set up too many terminals for users, because they could be using

04:41.877 --> 04:55.037
their PC as a library catalog and have access through their PC to internet, their email.

04:55.057 --> 05:00.044
How many of you are talking about the prefects?

05:00.064 --> 05:00.545
Yes, probably.

05:00.986 --> 05:03.830
Like Stickler, I suppose.

05:03.990 --> 05:04.611
Stickler, yes.

05:04.591 --> 05:23.892
There's also a cardinal who's in charge of the prefects.

05:23.932 --> 05:27.676
That is interesting.

05:28.317 --> 05:31.240
The cardinal's in charge of the prefects.

05:31.844 --> 05:56.350
Do you want to explain the difference between the cardinal who is like the title as opposed to the prefect?

05:56.380 --> 05:58.502
The prefect is the library director.

05:58.902 --> 06:11.574
The cardinal is a sort of protector of the library with the Holy See, so he's responsible for the library in general, the library and the archives as well.

06:17.379 --> 06:21.863
The current cardinal is Poggi, Luigi Poggi.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.345
He was nuncio,

06:26.857 --> 06:28.238
How do you spell his last name?

06:28.559 --> 06:42.272
Poggi, P-O, W-G-I, Luigi, first name.

06:42.292 --> 06:49.099
Is he a scholar in a particular field, like the prefect?

06:49.640 --> 06:55.986
No, he doesn't need to be a scholar unless he's a vicar who was former prefect and then

06:56.253 --> 07:14.430
was made up and was appointed cardinal other library other librarian cardinals were came from they don't need to be librarian actually but they don't need to be library special scholars it's just the title

07:15.845 --> 07:26.482
but presumably they are, I mean, all cardinals obviously have been scholars to become a cardinal, but presumably they might have a special interest in history or something.

07:26.502 --> 07:31.810
Yeah, but not necessarily in paleography or medieval studies.

07:32.091 --> 07:40.063
But matters, for instance, like policy, to determine whether or not you will embark on a major digitization project.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.886
That would be developed more by the prefect.

07:41.986 --> 07:43.168
The prefect, yes.

07:43.790 --> 08:02.489
The administration of the library, the management of the library, all the decisions that had to be taken on the library, for instance the staff or the projects, they would all be the prefect's responsibility.

08:02.509 --> 08:11.518
Of course he would have to discuss this with the cardinal, because then the cardinal would present the project to the

08:11.903 --> 08:16.027
to the Secretariat of State or to the Pope.

08:16.047 --> 08:23.596
But his sort of interface between the Secretariat of State and the Holy See and the Vatican.

08:23.616 --> 08:25.878
So it's earned the Vatican Lightroom.

08:26.579 --> 08:29.382
Are these portraits cut also in the past?

08:29.402 --> 08:30.243
Yes, in the past.

08:30.363 --> 08:31.804
In Greece.

08:32.705 --> 08:37.050
Actually, I'm now realizing that the very left

08:37.351 --> 08:57.748
Yeah, well in times the hall outside the walls, they say that when they get to the, they have all the portraits of the various popes, and when they, there is no space that is the end of the world, do they say.

08:58.048 --> 08:59.992
Oh my goodness.

09:00.353 --> 09:01.755
Anyway.

09:02.107 --> 09:06.152
I'll squeeze him in.

09:06.173 --> 09:10.959
Father Farina is a special student.

09:10.979 --> 09:16.466
Farina, he was dean at a university, Alasian University.

09:17.808 --> 09:21.453
But his personal academic interest?

09:21.473 --> 09:31.607
Yes, academic interest in methodology, research methodology, and

09:31.908 --> 09:34.592
Canon law.

09:35.714 --> 09:37.898
What is the study of pathology?

09:38.058 --> 09:58.371
Pathology, the fathers of the church, they are the founders of, if you want, yeah, those who wrote about theological matters in the Middle Ages, for instance, Ambrosius, Augustine.

10:02.317 --> 10:08.365
So this is from the 2nd, 3rd century A.D.

10:08.425 --> 10:12.150
till the 8th, 10th.

10:12.230 --> 10:16.075
I understand there's quite a major St.

10:16.155 --> 10:18.778
Augustine bibliographical project going on.

10:18.798 --> 10:21.262
I wonder if you could tell us something briefly about that.

10:21.282 --> 10:23.324
Is it going on here, or are there texts?

10:23.404 --> 10:23.745
St.

10:23.765 --> 10:24.406
Augustine?

10:24.546 --> 10:25.707
Oh, no, Thomas Aquinas.

10:25.908 --> 10:27.610
Oh, Thomas Aquinas, yes.

10:28.071 --> 10:29.873
No, it's not going on here.

10:30.013 --> 10:32.256
That is Father Boozer, who's

10:32.489 --> 10:36.854
Where was my mind?

10:36.974 --> 10:37.274
I'm sorry.

10:37.815 --> 10:38.676
I'm okay.

10:39.256 --> 10:41.419
It begins with an A, sort of.

10:42.580 --> 10:49.027
No, I mean lots of these projects, so it could have been, I mean, the Index to Mysticus.

10:55.153 --> 11:00.319
Isn't this a project that's supposed to take many generations to complete for many, many years?

11:00.822 --> 11:04.586
Yes, I suppose so, but I have very little information.

11:04.606 --> 11:06.369
It's not going on here.

11:06.669 --> 11:09.733
We're not involved with that project at all.

11:09.753 --> 11:17.742
Are there any bibliographic projects of similar scale that are going on here, of many years?

11:17.822 --> 11:29.496
Well, the catalog of manuscripts and their reproduction in machine-readable form will certainly take many years.

11:31.636 --> 11:48.531
Is there a danger, I mean, when you talk about books, I mean, when you do something like scanning, is there a danger that what you put it on now in three years will, or five years will?

11:48.812 --> 11:49.272
We're obsolete.

11:49.292 --> 11:49.692
We'll be obsolete.

11:49.712 --> 11:50.693
How do you prepare for that?

11:51.014 --> 12:00.242
Well, we try and, first of all, we try to comply with standards.

12:00.408 --> 12:07.217
So those which are standards de facto of the jure, we stick to those.

12:08.058 --> 12:21.114
So for instance, we are using map format as for description of books or manuscripts as well, documents anyway, bibliographic documents.

12:21.254 --> 12:28.103
As regards images, we try and make as many

12:28.522 --> 12:35.070
continuous backups as possible in various forms.

12:36.371 --> 12:55.474
This is a problem that will certainly need to be investigated before we go removed from the pilot project to the... I suppose it's actually not that much different from the manuscript to the typewriter to the printed... No, with the exception that

12:55.893 --> 13:01.162
Of course, printed material is always immediate, yes.

13:01.643 --> 13:10.138
You don't need any kind of interface with technology like CDs or archival electronic files.

13:10.679 --> 13:12.482
You need a computer.

13:12.502 --> 13:18.593
And all your data, say for instance, on disks which are 5-inch,

13:18.961 --> 13:33.298
I asked the question for her, because the first computer I had, of course, and then you'd have to read how you keep, and now everything keeps moving so fast.

13:33.318 --> 13:40.047
The concern of what they call migration of data is not so critical here, because they're not deaccessioning any of the things that they're scanning.

13:40.607 --> 13:46.234
But this is a concern that some institutions in the United States and elsewhere, where they are scanning things,

13:47.142 --> 13:57.096
and then getting rid of the original materials that they've scanned and relying on faith that the material will migrate from operating system to operating system.

13:57.196 --> 13:59.459
And that's a big gamble, isn't it?

13:59.760 --> 14:00.361
Indeed, yes.

14:00.962 --> 14:13.960
I think that we now have, here we have a laboratory preservation specialist, and so far his responsibility was

14:14.294 --> 14:20.502
conservation of documents, primary documents, manuscripts, or other things.

14:20.522 --> 14:34.899
I suppose now one new role will be the preservation of electronic documents separate from primary documents.

14:34.919 --> 14:43.930
There's a task force that has just been established at the Library of Congress charged with precisely that mandate to come up with ways to safeguard

14:44.450 --> 15:02.154
It was just a case decided in Washington where the historians, a group of historians, sued the government, which had been giving permission to various bureaucracies to destroy electronic material without any hard copies and without going through any kind of a... So the judge told them they couldn't do that.

15:02.755 --> 15:05.399
But you have to have safeguards.

15:05.419 --> 15:12.689
And as you know, there is no guarantee that this material... We know paper can last hundreds of years.

15:12.749 --> 15:14.271
We don't know how long...

15:14.470 --> 15:16.433
What did that man tell us about the bibliotech now?

15:16.453 --> 15:18.075
You know, it degrades.

15:18.095 --> 15:21.199
The material absolutely degrades over a period of time.

15:21.219 --> 15:31.893
Yeah, so I think we should, we certainly should create this post for preservation of the material.

15:32.874 --> 15:36.159
The person in charge, just for that.

15:36.179 --> 15:37.681
Just for that, yes.

15:37.701 --> 15:43.228
Study all the dangers

15:45.065 --> 15:51.113
I suppose I can be destroyed by heat.

15:51.153 --> 16:04.390
You must sort of plan for regular migrations or backwards.

16:04.690 --> 16:11.038
It implies organizational changes in the structure of the hybrid.

16:16.823 --> 16:38.717
I've got the camera, I'm sorry.

16:38.737 --> 16:40.620
I'm just saying nothing for the other 13.

16:45.663 --> 16:53.314
What is the significance of the statue, as we come in, of the Greek statue?

16:53.334 --> 17:02.406
Oh, yeah, that's... The statue, Mr. Howard, there, was an archaeological find.

17:02.486 --> 17:05.190
The statue, in fact, is a...

17:05.609 --> 17:14.281
a replica of the Hellenistic period, but the throne is the original.

17:15.202 --> 17:22.693
It's an old Greek, part of an old Greek statue, and on the side you will see there is a sort of calendar.

17:23.915 --> 17:27.139
Oh, is that a calendar?

17:27.159 --> 17:28.862
That's a calendar, yes.

17:28.882 --> 17:29.062
And what?

17:29.082 --> 17:29.503
Hippolytus?

17:29.523 --> 17:31.245
He was a philosopher.

17:33.824 --> 17:37.510
Beautiful.

17:37.891 --> 17:46.725
So that was like a calendar, isn't it?

17:46.745 --> 17:46.825
Yes.

17:46.845 --> 17:48.748
That's why it was so repetitious.

17:48.768 --> 17:56.260
And the Tower of the Wind, that used to be the Astronomic Observatory.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.287
The Gregorian calendar was all the studies

18:00.757 --> 18:07.586
which led to the definition of the Gregorian calendar were carried out up there.

18:08.287 --> 18:18.141
And it used to be the department where Queen Christine of Sweden was.

18:18.281 --> 18:18.602
Up there?

18:18.622 --> 18:21.025
Yes, up there, yes.

18:21.386 --> 18:25.051
Up, up the Tower of the Four Winds, yes.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.257
There was the Alessandra Library, which is in the Vatican.

18:29.277 --> 18:30.358
Yes, it's here in the Vatican.

18:30.642 --> 18:35.888
That's the secret archives over there, and there are stacks.

18:35.908 --> 18:41.255
And here, underground, the stacks, the manuscripts, stacks.

18:41.315 --> 18:51.047
The manuscripts are kept in controlled conditions, environmental conditions, so you see the outlets of people.

18:52.023 --> 19:15.482
of the air conditioning what is the name of this area this is called the the library courtyard it was the intermediate plateau so the upper plateau up there then this and that is the cortile della pigna today corresponds to the cortile della pigna then the library courtyard and the belvedere courtyard and

19:16.660 --> 19:25.034
There was a ray up there, so you could overlook the lower, the lower plateau.

19:25.054 --> 19:28.801
That was the Belvedere, a nice view, was from up there.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.345
And the manuscripts are down below there?

19:31.365 --> 19:32.307
Down below here, yes.

19:32.327 --> 19:36.614
It is quite appropriate that Queen Christina lived really, literally, with the book, didn't she?

19:36.634 --> 19:40.641
Yes, but not very long, just a few days or a few weeks.

19:40.661 --> 19:41.021
A few days?

19:41.041 --> 19:42.043
Yes, a few weeks.

19:46.343 --> 19:47.765
But it was appropriate, yes.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.029
And what do you call those rooms again?

19:51.049 --> 19:53.573
Does it have a name where she stays?

19:53.593 --> 19:56.316
No, that is, the building is called the Tower of the Wind.

19:56.456 --> 20:09.954
It's the tallest building of the Vatican, with the exception, of course, of the domes.

20:09.974 --> 20:15.642
And the Sistine reading room was upstairs, so I was taken upstairs.

20:16.448 --> 20:44.177
But now let me show you something which is... Thank you.

20:48.595 --> 21:11.616
And then Pius VII, that was during the Holyoke years,

21:11.596 --> 21:24.137
built this building on top which is the Museo Chiaramonti and the fountain just became a warehouse.

21:24.640 --> 21:33.751
And then in the 80s, they decided to transform it into a bar, and it's now a bar.

21:34.452 --> 21:35.493
So, what are you having?

21:38.897 --> 21:40.439
Coffee.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.463
That's, I think, a lunch.

21:44.004 --> 21:45.185
Maybe a fruit juice.

21:45.205 --> 21:45.906
Fruit juice.

21:45.886 --> 21:55.174
Anything to eat?

21:56.996 --> 22:03.202
Why don't you put your chip recorder around?

22:03.382 --> 22:06.885
Too many.

22:09.928 --> 22:10.788
Keeps us fit.

22:12.370 --> 22:12.590
Yes.

22:13.551 --> 22:14.712
Well...

22:15.637 --> 22:24.948
Three, three or four, sorry, four.

22:25.209 --> 22:45.373
The second floor, the periodicals, reading rooms, the first floor, the manuscript and printed material reading room, the second floor, and the 15th chapel, the 16th library, and the museum of the third floor.

22:45.758 --> 23:00.440
This room of the ancient library.

23:00.980 --> 23:15.141
And this furniture here, this is the original furniture of the Library of Sixtus IV, so 1425, 1486.

23:15.863 --> 23:25.082
Again, other briefcase and cardinals of this library.

23:25.102 --> 23:29.972
And this was referenced material because the books were kept inside.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.758
People came and certain things were

23:33.650 --> 23:42.124
And this was the reading room.

23:42.685 --> 23:44.809
Like the Urbino.

23:45.129 --> 23:46.612
Yes, like the Urbino.

23:49.236 --> 23:57.109
This room, middle 14th, 15th century.

23:59.671 --> 24:06.658
er, sorry, 16th century, middle 16th century.

24:07.138 --> 24:08.980
This is the corridor.

24:09.000 --> 24:24.034
The readers came from the corridor here at the back, came to this, this was the vestibolo, where the reference was in on the steps, and then the window was here.

24:24.715 --> 24:28.378
It's so wonderful, there are a lot of books in the hand.

24:30.097 --> 24:50.688
Oh, is there any tradition or not?

24:50.708 --> 24:50.788
Yes.

24:50.808 --> 24:59.361
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

25:00.353 --> 25:06.342
So, this is the, this used to be the reading room, the library reading room.

25:06.362 --> 25:19.442
All of the frescoes on the wall, on the history of the libraries, the various libraries, Babylon, and all the libraries in the past.

25:20.384 --> 25:40.473
and all the various councils on the bible and the book, the holy book and here the creators originated in various alphabets Are these reproduced in a book that can be purchased?

25:42.235 --> 25:44.198
I suppose so, yes, yes

25:44.650 --> 25:45.832
It's the history of libraries.

25:46.152 --> 25:47.494
History of libraries, yes.

25:47.855 --> 25:50.218
Are they burning?

25:50.238 --> 25:52.482
Are they in the, like, Nardini book?

25:52.502 --> 25:53.263
I don't know.

25:53.283 --> 25:55.006
Yes, they should be.

25:55.026 --> 25:55.426
Nardini book.

25:55.446 --> 25:58.972
They're in the book.

25:58.992 --> 26:02.397
This was 6th of the 5th.

26:02.417 --> 26:08.406
And 6th of the 5th is the Pope who created this library, this 15th room.

26:08.546 --> 26:12.632
And who, that's the Pope that...

26:13.085 --> 26:15.949
set up the obelisk, right?

26:15.969 --> 26:18.093
Yes, the obelisk.

26:18.113 --> 26:28.989
I couldn't remember which pope it was, but then it made it.

26:29.009 --> 26:30.812
Hebrew.

26:40.026 --> 26:40.847
Hebrew.

26:46.919 --> 27:10.513
So Vatican, this was Vaticani Latini, the Vatican Latin Maniscuits, from number 2171 to number 2288.

27:10.898 --> 27:26.443
and here you will find from number 2289 two numbers 2289 to 2327 and so forth so these were the stacks these were the stacks yes oh under

27:26.677 --> 27:29.381
until 189.

27:29.401 --> 27:47.925
These are all the fountains of the very chapter.

27:50.403 --> 28:09.894
They were rather interesting that they looked rather like chinoiserie, you know, rather than, I don't know, but maybe I'm just not quite knowledgeable about the antique furniture.

28:10.014 --> 28:13.660
Well, they were not the original ones, they were...

28:14.517 --> 28:20.146
Most of them were all along the gallery.

28:20.166 --> 28:23.751
These little reading desks?

28:23.831 --> 28:25.794
These, maybe?

28:25.814 --> 28:27.317
Which ones?

28:27.337 --> 28:27.717
Yes.

28:29.840 --> 28:36.070
Well, they look far away.

28:37.433 --> 28:39.196
All of them were preserved.

28:39.216 --> 28:53.057
Some of these are part of the collection of... These were gifts presented to the folks.

28:53.077 --> 28:56.623
So you can see, for instance, this one, Gifts of Nathanae.

29:05.851 --> 29:11.638
Just what you wanted.

29:11.658 --> 29:12.199
Here it is.

29:12.800 --> 29:24.694
I love these pictures over here.

29:24.714 --> 29:26.316
Yes, that's beautiful.

29:26.336 --> 29:33.225
That one, you see, that is the Sibylla.

29:33.475 --> 29:56.027
Torquinius, King Torquinius, who orders to throw the books, burn all the books, until he gets to the very last one, and he asks the Sibylla witch to know the story and what was expected Roe, and she said that it was the books that he had destroyed.

29:56.047 --> 29:56.888
I don't know this story.

29:57.349 --> 29:58.791
This is her, yes.

29:59.071 --> 29:59.712
The Sibyl.

29:59.732 --> 30:01.575
The Sibyl, yes, the Sibyl.

30:02.686 --> 30:03.807
He destroyed all the books?

30:03.827 --> 30:04.548
The books, yes.

30:04.648 --> 30:04.968
No way.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.611
Was he just anti-intellectual?

30:07.651 --> 30:11.255
This is in the Etruscan?

30:11.275 --> 30:29.655
Yes, in the Etruscan, because it was the... Yes, the... But it's interesting, because in these press codes, we also have... For instance, there you see the art of...

30:29.905 --> 30:34.330
of copying manuscripts, you see.

30:34.811 --> 30:41.439
Then we present the Biblioteca Ierosolimitana, the Jerusalem Library.

30:41.459 --> 30:51.871
But of course it's not interesting for the library itself, because it's just a, you know, it's a reproduction of a Renaissance library.

30:51.971 --> 30:55.035
You see all the copyists which are doing

30:55.184 --> 31:01.194
and the way they bind their manuscripts and how they keep them on the stalls.

31:01.214 --> 31:10.949
It's quite interesting for the history of book and book binding.

31:10.969 --> 31:21.587
It's quite interesting to see that it's written in the manuscript.

31:21.607 --> 31:21.867
It really is.

31:25.272 --> 31:44.848
Why don't I flip it now so you don't want to see?

31:44.868 --> 31:45.049
Oh, sure.

31:45.069 --> 31:45.590
And you want to hold this?

31:45.610 --> 31:46.111
I can hold that.

31:46.131 --> 31:46.852
This is at the end of what you want.

31:46.872 --> 31:48.495
You might be able to find it all.

31:50.112 --> 31:58.080
Thank you.

31:59.967 --> 32:21.497
I think I already have them.

32:21.517 --> 32:25.843
This is the museum.

32:25.863 --> 32:29.248
Again, part of the stats, these are all the stats until

32:30.443 --> 32:33.927
The end of last century.

32:33.947 --> 32:44.840
These are other gifts, right?

32:44.860 --> 32:46.501
These are.

32:46.521 --> 32:46.962
Yes.

32:48.464 --> 32:49.325
Yes, there.

32:53.750 --> 32:53.970
Yes, there.

32:54.389 --> 33:12.551
And these were folks from the Capitol Hill?

33:12.571 --> 33:12.651
Yes.

33:16.512 --> 33:39.178
Now we come to the collection of objects of art.

33:43.445 --> 33:48.251
By the way, here you have a view over the garden, the Vatican garden.

33:49.452 --> 33:50.333
That's beautiful.

33:50.353 --> 33:54.939
Well, that is the Academia Science Academy.

33:55.519 --> 33:57.882
Typical Science Academy.

33:57.922 --> 34:10.237
The building was built by the famous Italian artesians.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.598
Not Fontana, no.

34:11.618 --> 34:13.080
No, not Fontana.

34:13.583 --> 34:41.274
It's beautiful inside, isn't it?

34:41.294 --> 34:41.995
The first half of the 15th century.

34:42.015 --> 34:42.375
The men and women.

34:45.595 --> 34:49.080
Italy is, where is it?

34:49.340 --> 34:49.701
There.

34:51.043 --> 34:51.764
That's where?

34:51.784 --> 34:55.890
Yes, because this is Bologna.

34:55.910 --> 34:56.691
Bologna.

34:57.753 --> 35:02.299
There you see Rome is there.

35:02.319 --> 35:06.706
But there is Manfredonia in Puglia, which is a very small town.

35:06.806 --> 35:10.371
And, yeah.

35:10.537 --> 35:25.718
So this would have been not used for them to make engravings, it was the way it was, in other words, six months?

35:25.738 --> 35:27.601
Yes.

35:27.621 --> 35:29.423
I wouldn't have done them.

35:29.639 --> 35:31.422
Brass rubbing.

35:32.043 --> 35:34.587
No, no, no, no.

35:34.607 --> 35:35.228
This is a map.

35:35.408 --> 35:38.112
This is the original.

35:38.192 --> 35:42.780
It's a map of windows facing east.

35:43.020 --> 35:43.601
Africa.

35:43.621 --> 35:47.807
This is Africa.

35:47.908 --> 35:54.758
It's not oriented to the true north.

35:55.079 --> 35:56.581
No, it's the south.

35:56.661 --> 35:57.823
North is here.

35:58.327 --> 35:59.271
Yes.

35:59.351 --> 36:07.763
And here this is...

36:08.873 --> 36:37.851
anglia that's england and that is the adrian's walls scotland and england and ireland is just there i've never seen anything like that before in granada spain valencia barcelona barcelona toletum saragossa

36:38.641 --> 36:40.543
And these are the Pyrenees.

36:40.663 --> 36:44.326
This is France.

36:44.346 --> 36:51.873
Torosa, Burgundia.

36:51.893 --> 37:06.927
And here you have Camelorum, Nubia, Alexandria, and this is the river Nile.

37:08.594 --> 37:31.497
It's not bad considering... Do you know the world map has to be...

37:36.623 --> 38:00.520
It's a little bit alive, isn't it?

38:00.540 --> 38:01.602
Here's a variety of items from the land of the world.

38:01.582 --> 38:02.683
Bells.

38:04.906 --> 38:05.126
Bells.

38:05.787 --> 38:06.107
Blue.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.029
Slow swans.

38:08.049 --> 38:09.110
Anything.

38:09.691 --> 38:14.036
Now this is the museum of profane ice.

38:15.017 --> 38:18.821
So these are all the finds from the cataclylds.

38:19.102 --> 38:20.403
The cataclylds?

38:20.423 --> 38:20.743
Yes.

38:20.763 --> 38:22.305
Nice.

38:22.405 --> 38:23.226
Look at that.

38:23.246 --> 38:23.767
Pottery.

38:24.788 --> 38:26.610
How beautiful.

38:27.535 --> 38:42.000
Isn't that funny?

38:44.309 --> 39:03.021
They belong to the library because they belong to the book before the book is suggested that they are.

39:03.041 --> 39:03.222
Yes, yes.

39:03.242 --> 39:03.482
The library.

39:05.555 --> 39:08.539
The papyrus, the papyrus collection.

39:09.461 --> 39:09.861
Oh, my goodness.

39:09.881 --> 39:10.602
The papyri room.

39:10.943 --> 39:12.245
This is the papyri room.

39:12.265 --> 39:13.406
This is the papyri room.

39:13.787 --> 39:17.252
These are replicas, they're not the original.

39:17.272 --> 39:21.018
The most important collection of medieval papyri in Latin?

39:21.038 --> 39:30.972
As you see here, papyri are codices, but they were shown as an exhibition, so as objects in a museum, you see, because it was not.

39:31.188 --> 39:52.679
It's not so clear the distinction between a museum and a library.

39:52.699 --> 39:53.500
It's kind of a tradition style, you see?

40:00.922 --> 40:16.398
This depiction of angels with the pelicans.

40:17.859 --> 40:23.325
These are frescoes.

40:23.345 --> 40:25.667
From Ostia.

40:25.687 --> 40:27.549
That's very beautiful.

40:27.569 --> 40:29.311
Very beautiful.

40:29.331 --> 40:30.152
Look at the

40:30.824 --> 40:32.907
She's beautiful.

40:34.929 --> 40:36.531
Yeah, very beautiful.

40:36.551 --> 40:39.135
I wanted to show you a room of frescoes.

40:39.155 --> 40:40.737
I have no idea that these actually belong to the library.

40:41.077 --> 40:46.924
Of course, it's clear when you come to the museum that this belongs to the library, as you know.

40:47.665 --> 40:51.991
It's the Nancy Aldo Grandini, a well-known fresco, but it's an exhibition in Paris.

40:52.692 --> 40:56.076
You just came from Paris, so... Did you come from Paris?

40:56.176 --> 40:58.219
I've not worked in Fresco two months ago.

40:58.239 --> 40:59.500
Well, anyway, it's there.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.021
It's there.

41:02.330 --> 41:07.716
It's very well done.

41:08.076 --> 41:11.080
This is the... Oh, marriage.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.121
Yeah, the marriage, yes.

41:12.982 --> 41:14.243
The bride.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.686
And the sax hunter.

41:16.706 --> 41:18.007
And the singer.

41:23.333 --> 41:23.694
That is beautiful.

41:23.714 --> 41:24.815
And these are the gold.

41:25.055 --> 41:25.896
Gold glass.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.338
This is called gold glass.

41:28.259 --> 41:31.122
Used to be when...

41:31.692 --> 41:50.339
when people were dead before in Beringham, they drank together, then they smashed the glass, and then they put this on the fresh, they put it as a souvenir in the tomb.

41:50.359 --> 41:50.820
This is how it felt.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.003
Do you see this?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.607
This is the base of the glass.

41:56.296 --> 42:00.080
It's a thin layer of gold, yeah.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.524
It's a weight for gold in two layers of glass.

42:04.405 --> 42:06.607
You can't see anything like that before.

42:06.627 --> 42:08.569
Yeah, what was the signature?

42:08.589 --> 42:11.593
This one's like a toast to the... Yeah, a toast to the afterlife, please.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.154
Yes, to the afterlife, yes.

42:13.174 --> 42:19.281
In fact, some of these is either like vita ti be, life be with you.

42:19.902 --> 42:22.945
So it's like a... Yes, I'm sorry.

42:23.532 --> 42:40.132
Or it could be in Greek, like they say, and here is a... So this means that life, that we can drink together many times.

42:42.094 --> 42:44.117
And where did you recover these?

42:44.137 --> 42:44.878
Catacombs.

42:44.898 --> 42:46.239
Yes, catacombs.

42:46.259 --> 42:49.143
This is beautiful, look, you see colour.

42:49.163 --> 42:52.527
It's all gold, it's not colours, there's no colour, it's just the way

42:52.979 --> 42:56.665
the glass is treated.

42:56.785 --> 43:13.872
And this for instance, the very realistic, for instance, in this case, these are the portraits of the dead.

43:14.052 --> 43:17.417
All people who did not afford to have this,

43:17.802 --> 43:22.813
These smaller ones, which were sort of so very common.

43:22.854 --> 43:26.041
They're almost three-dimensional in a way, aren't they?

43:26.742 --> 43:27.584
Yes, they are.

43:27.985 --> 43:33.899
To think that this leads to these three are the most beautiful ones.

43:33.919 --> 43:34.921
And what do you call them once?

43:35.041 --> 43:35.843
Gold glass.

43:36.224 --> 43:37.026
Gold glass.

43:38.423 --> 43:41.946
And you shattered the glass and it was the base, the heavy part of the bottom.

43:41.986 --> 43:45.470
This one looks like... So this would have been, oh yeah, like the base.

43:45.490 --> 43:57.722
The base of the glass, they drank, they smashed the glass, and then they put this... Isn't that interesting because in like Jewish or Greek weddings they do that, you know, they smash the glass.

43:59.584 --> 44:03.908
Because by smashing the glass, in other words, something is finished.

44:03.955 --> 44:05.839
It's like finished.

44:06.039 --> 44:10.348
It's a souvenir that you won't have it again.

44:10.748 --> 44:14.496
You will not marry again.

44:14.556 --> 44:19.225
Just by now let me do it, I guess.

44:20.367 --> 44:20.467
Yes.

44:20.528 --> 44:21.590
The view of the book.

44:21.630 --> 44:22.992
The mosaics from Bastia.

44:23.634 --> 44:24.816
I'll take the step on it.

44:27.293 --> 44:46.758
It almost looks like a tiger, aren't you?

44:46.779 --> 44:51.765
Ryan, uh, Dean.

44:53.180 --> 45:20.250
I never thought about it until you waited it out.

45:20.787 --> 45:24.493
Were these originally also pieces for books, or have they always been?

45:25.875 --> 45:29.581
No, these were display cases.

45:29.601 --> 45:32.646
Display cases.

45:32.666 --> 45:40.778
And how would you know, except if it became fair with you, that this was the beginning of the library?

45:41.139 --> 45:45.426
Because coming from the Sistine... Sure.

45:45.786 --> 45:46.828
That's true.

45:46.808 --> 46:12.900
Thank you.

46:12.920 --> 46:13.120
Thank you.

46:13.100 --> 46:16.945
I didn't know to pay attention.

46:17.966 --> 46:20.209
This is how people know.

46:21.090 --> 46:26.377
This is the library court, Belvedere courtyard, and the fine town court.

46:26.397 --> 46:29.401
There are three platters.

46:29.982 --> 46:37.532
This is the bar here, and this is the library, the Sistine room.

46:37.772 --> 46:41.036
And now we are at this room.

46:41.056 --> 46:41.757
We're here.

46:41.737 --> 47:10.866
The sectors of the museum circuit in the care of the Vatican and Apollos Library.

47:17.663 --> 47:42.532
Hey, this is not on.

47:42.552 --> 47:42.792
It's not on.

47:42.812 --> 47:43.052
It's not on.

47:43.072 --> 47:43.273
I'm sorry.

47:43.293 --> 47:46.296
Oh, it's off, I think, this way.

47:46.316 --> 47:47.097
Well, I don't know where I'm recording.
