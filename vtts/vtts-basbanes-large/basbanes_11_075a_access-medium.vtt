WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:22.579
And Priscilla Jebelis.

00:22.879 --> 00:23.220
Milo.

00:23.555 --> 00:32.048
Well, it could be, but not of this quality.

00:32.088 --> 00:40.821
That was Don's point, that ten years ago there weren't a hundred bindings of this quality that could be got together in this country.

00:41.240 --> 01:00.058
um for the exhibition are you saying that american mining is really a creature in the last 10 years longer than that but in the past 10 years it's grown by leaps and bounds a creature of this quality yes a creature of this quality surely it's just gotten real a lot more sophisticated

01:00.038 --> 01:02.681
in a row in a decade.

01:03.081 --> 01:05.543
How do you explain that?

01:05.964 --> 01:06.564
Hard work.

01:06.864 --> 01:13.411
Is it an explosion of talent, blossoming forth all at the same time?

01:13.751 --> 01:26.383
I think that probably the people, a whole lot of the people that are exhibiting here would have been exhibiting in that show that didn't happen 10 years ago.

01:26.363 --> 01:29.468
But they're just better now.

01:29.569 --> 01:31.332
It seems to me that you're out there, too.

01:31.352 --> 01:31.552
Yeah.

01:31.672 --> 01:34.137
I don't think you existed 10 years ago.

01:34.297 --> 01:39.967
Not like now, but we were there 10 years ago.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.329
But you were just starting.

01:41.349 --> 01:46.519
What year were you in Paris studying?

01:46.539 --> 01:48.482
What was the year?

01:48.542 --> 01:49.063
75.

01:49.550 --> 01:50.632
75, 76.

01:52.135 --> 02:03.296
So 10 years ago would have been 81, so you would have been only binding for four or five years after studying.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.241
Is this what you do professionally?

02:06.502 --> 02:07.103
You bind?

02:07.083 --> 02:10.047
How does one become a binder?

02:10.808 --> 02:12.109
Good question.

02:12.210 --> 02:21.181
I mean, you certainly must have artistic... Well, people come to make this in lots of different directions.

02:21.341 --> 02:28.370
I mean, there's not... But what about you, Don?

02:28.390 --> 02:28.831
How did you...?

02:28.851 --> 02:30.593
I came... I majored in sculpture and art.

02:31.838 --> 02:38.406
in California, San Jose State University Art School.

02:38.426 --> 02:48.017
And after I couldn't make any money doing that, after I got out of school, I just got jobs.

02:48.037 --> 02:53.083
And one of them was a, I repaired books at the Stanford Library.

02:53.683 --> 02:56.867
This was a job, you know, just a dumb job.

02:57.286 --> 03:00.170
I mean, it required no skill.

03:00.370 --> 03:03.735
I told you how to use the masking tape.

03:03.755 --> 03:08.321
But I kind of liked it.

03:08.562 --> 03:11.826
Yeah, it was kind of fun.

03:11.846 --> 03:15.351
It was kind of mindless.

03:15.371 --> 03:22.281
But anyway, I figured out that there was a way to make books that was not destructive, which is what...

03:23.594 --> 03:26.538
consider what I was doing at this library.

03:26.558 --> 03:29.721
You know, I was like putting terrible materials and stuff on books.

03:29.742 --> 03:44.860
So I kind of got into it from a concern for conservation of the materials almost, which is not what I'm interested in now.

03:45.363 --> 04:00.304
I remember this as a person whose primary interest is in the text, in the book.

04:01.585 --> 04:02.747
Yeah, in the literature.

04:02.987 --> 04:06.392
Yeah, all of this fascination for the binding is really

04:06.946 --> 04:18.222
But has there ever been, for you,

04:20.632 --> 04:32.709
I mean, the book, I mean, at what point is the book, the book, the binding, the binding, or do they become... Yeah, sure.

04:32.989 --> 04:34.972
People ask that question a lot.

04:37.155 --> 04:48.951
I think that, for me, I mean, I can only say for me, but... But the binding, the binding of the book needs to be...

04:49.522 --> 04:58.693
Good luck to everybody.

04:58.753 --> 05:10.908
Some people decide to take a real modest role in the making of this object.

05:11.809 --> 05:16.795
Some blinders want to take a modest role in the making

05:17.230 --> 05:24.521
finely crafted object that is the whole book, right?

05:24.541 --> 05:32.293
And so those people, I think, I mean, they were there tonight, you know, the books were there tonight.

05:32.313 --> 05:38.863
They tended to be quieter and, you know, more like decorative.

05:38.883 --> 05:44.031
I mean, as opposed to making some sort of aesthetic statement, they were

05:45.395 --> 05:50.949
were designed to show off the text and all that stuff.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.092
And they were there.

05:54.859 --> 05:57.666
But there's other approaches, and I just take it.

05:58.152 --> 06:08.343
Well, if we're going to talk about books, then we have to have a great book collector, Champagne, right?

06:08.844 --> 06:14.310
Rotoroo is one of the greatest collectors of books that ever lived.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.373
They rest in peace, right?

06:17.393 --> 06:19.796
The Rotoroo collection was bought by Rosenbach in 21.

06:19.816 --> 06:25.442
It was the greatest book collection ever to leave France.

06:25.422 --> 06:32.298
R-O-E-D-E-R-E-R, Louis Audraire.

06:33.100 --> 06:42.182
He owned all the original UD drawings for the tables of La Fontaine, and he owned over 130 or 140

06:42.398 --> 06:48.247
original drawings by Fragonard for a... That's why she wanted his champagne.

06:48.528 --> 06:52.594
He had to mix it like champagne.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.881
That were never published because the drawings were so free.

06:57.402 --> 07:01.128
Because Fragonard could be as modern as Manet or Goya.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.512
And the...

07:04.083 --> 07:15.461
The brush, the pencil lines were so free and so unstructured that he was told by his publisher that they could not be transformed into engravings.

07:15.481 --> 07:16.903
So the book was never made.

07:17.244 --> 07:28.842
But the drawings for the book were in the Roderick Collection and Arthur Houghtonbottom from John Fleming.

07:28.923 --> 07:35.313
And he paid $30,000 or $40,000.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.516
That's a few years ago, too.

07:37.536 --> 07:42.864
Yeah, it was in 53 or 54, but even still he got the bargain of the century.

07:43.104 --> 07:47.171
No, Houghton shot a mile of the bargain of the century, but this was close.

07:49.113 --> 07:54.762
Anyway, he had great books, really great books, in great bindings from the French tradition.

07:55.130 --> 08:04.761
Did you have a sense of this tradition when you became a biker or did you just become a biker?

08:04.781 --> 08:06.503
Yeah, I knew that there was that tradition.

08:06.523 --> 08:09.847
That's one thing I really liked about it.

08:09.867 --> 08:15.153
There was a feeling to be a sculptor, you know, like none of that.

08:15.173 --> 08:21.541
If there is any of this tradition, I kind of try and bury it.

08:21.561 --> 08:22.842
Try and do something really

08:23.125 --> 08:41.472
off the wall and you know something that nobody's ever even thought of before and that's what that was about as i understood it with binding there was this long tradition and i mean you understood this or you appreciated this when you became a bind

08:41.705 --> 08:46.190
Do you think he has absorbed the tradition?

08:46.231 --> 08:46.751
Absolutely.

08:46.871 --> 08:52.799
I mean, he's taken the best of the French tradition.

08:52.819 --> 09:09.619
And my problem with the contemporary French binding is that they have not moved into the post-war period in a big way, whereas I think Don and one or two other American libraries have, in fact, brought binding into

09:10.358 --> 09:17.788
the same world that, I don't know, Jasper Johns or de Kooning or, you know... Can you be specific at all?

09:17.808 --> 09:19.109
How have they go this?

09:20.271 --> 09:24.436
Well, instead of... Yeah, okay.

09:24.556 --> 09:36.872
Around 1930 and 1940, French Binders started using the front and back cover of the book

09:37.139 --> 09:49.045
to execute their designs on as if it were more or less a canvas rather than a book with a front and back cover on a spine.

09:49.446 --> 09:55.198
In other words, the design element, what they were going to put on the binding went

09:55.533 --> 09:59.619
When you opened the book up, it went across the two covers.

10:02.022 --> 10:14.220
But they were still pretty much, they started to do that, but they were still pretty much visually wedded to that book form of front cover, back cover, and spine.

10:16.002 --> 10:19.788
Is this something that somebody like myself would notice?

10:20.509 --> 10:21.270
Can't miss it.

10:21.689 --> 10:22.430
Okay.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.472
You saw the stuff side by side.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.414
You can't miss it.

10:26.794 --> 10:31.059
But what's going on now in Don's Bindings is a three-dimensional sort of thing.

10:31.159 --> 10:35.363
In other words, the covers of the book are no longer the covers of a book only.

10:35.523 --> 10:37.445
They are that, but they're more than that.

10:37.485 --> 10:45.053
They are the canvas or the base on which to make an artistic statement.

10:45.073 --> 10:49.958
Do you think that, and this is where we get into the three-dimensional setting,

10:50.056 --> 10:55.937
My question is, does this exceed the definition of a binding?

10:56.821 --> 11:00.775
Is it no longer a binding and is it listed as a matter of fact to itself?

11:01.058 --> 11:06.125
something that we appreciate in its own merits, apart from the text.

11:06.145 --> 11:08.287
And again, I'm a book person, so I'm asking this question.

11:08.327 --> 11:09.609
No question in my mind.

11:09.629 --> 11:10.851
Are we talking about books?

11:10.991 --> 11:12.112
Are we talking about structures?

11:12.192 --> 11:13.114
And they're both fine.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.976
I want to know what I'm talking about.

11:15.036 --> 11:20.203
No question in my mind that it's, besides being a book, it's also an object.

11:20.443 --> 11:28.333
And the binding can be appreciated by itself, but a binding on a great illuminated manuscript can also be appreciated by itself.

11:28.433 --> 11:30.576
An illumination is not

11:30.927 --> 11:40.347
and that is, in fact, there are many bindings like that.

11:40.367 --> 11:48.244
And when you look at a Pavlou binding or a Goyer binding, you are appreciating the binding just as much

11:48.224 --> 11:55.735
for what it is rather than the fact that it covers the book that may happen to be valuable.

11:55.755 --> 11:59.760
So I don't see that what's happening now is a break in the tradition.

11:59.780 --> 12:01.423
I just see it increased.

12:01.443 --> 12:03.546
I don't think it's a break.

12:04.127 --> 12:16.965
What I was going to say before is that at least for me, I guess I can't really talk about it.

12:17.452 --> 12:24.519
too much about what other people are doing, but I just take a pretty active part in the making.

12:24.840 --> 12:31.807
I see the thing that gets put in a box and sent off to you, the collector, as a real integrated unit.

12:33.369 --> 12:44.320
And so the binding is a part of it, but I think that I probably take a more active part in making that object, that whole unit, when it gets put in that box.

12:44.688 --> 12:48.753
Let's take a case.

12:50.035 --> 12:52.398
I'm a client.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.522
I send you a book.

12:55.543 --> 12:58.727
Does the binding evolve?

12:58.887 --> 13:00.930
Do you read text?

13:01.791 --> 13:05.796
Do you have a reading experience with it?

13:05.816 --> 13:08.620
Does it affect you in such a way that you are?

13:08.954 --> 13:12.099
move to create the binding that you did to create?

13:12.119 --> 13:18.348
You know, it's not the metaphysical, but the creative process that goes into the making of the writing.

13:18.849 --> 13:21.332
For one part of that.

13:21.553 --> 13:23.355
Many, many, many books.

13:23.455 --> 13:24.056
Tell me what happens.

13:24.297 --> 13:24.918
I'm curious about what happens.

13:24.938 --> 13:25.999
Right.

13:26.019 --> 13:33.751
Usually, books that I get, I don't know why, maybe it's the way books are nowadays, are with images in them.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.653
They're illustrated in some kind of way.

13:35.673 --> 13:38.117
You know, they're in etchings or photographs or something.

13:38.468 --> 13:41.313
So these are the things that people weren't bound to.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.456
Well, let me just add that that's a French tradition.

13:44.218 --> 13:58.241
I mean, the French have always thought that any books with original graphic art and the original works of art in the books should, in fact, have a work of art on the outside of the book, or one of a kind as our divining.

13:58.261 --> 14:02.288
That's not exactly what we saw here tonight.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.712
All of my books that were there, that's what you saw.

14:04.692 --> 14:29.367
There were all books illustrated with original graphics, that is, the books he had original art in it, and all the books that Don, except for the one that he made himself, which has original art in it, because it's his own book, his own paintings on the inside, that certainly all were, I mean, one was illustrated with lithographs by Picasso, another one with

14:29.347 --> 14:43.121
Do you think that's kind of a working definition then, that ideally the spine binding should house a work of art?

14:43.241 --> 14:49.608
In the past, let's just say that's the French tradition.

14:49.628 --> 14:55.033
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to put

14:55.537 --> 15:17.157
as much energy as it takes to make a binding like most of them who were there tonight on something like that that's not a nifty thing doesn't mean it has to be worth a lot of money but it has to be it doesn't make so let's go back to the process

15:19.415 --> 15:29.411
When I get a book, like I say, usually, and I can't think of, but a couple of things.

15:29.611 --> 15:35.981
That's a pain, but it will focus on you.

15:36.001 --> 15:40.889
Most of the time, the books are Elstrand.

15:40.909 --> 15:42.992
So there is literature, you know.

15:43.765 --> 15:45.507
Usually, not even always.

15:45.788 --> 15:51.616
I mean, usually there's visual stuff to look at in the books.

15:51.636 --> 15:54.740
And there's also usually literature.

15:54.881 --> 15:59.327
And so if there is literature, I try and read it.

15:59.347 --> 16:02.611
I think it's in the language that I can read.

16:02.631 --> 16:03.853
I try and rent a movie.

16:03.913 --> 16:05.475
If it isn't, I mean, you know, whatever.

16:05.495 --> 16:08.500
However I can get it, you know, and get what I can get.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.080
I call Priscilla.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.002
What's this about?

16:10.022 --> 16:10.903
You know, I do something.

16:11.980 --> 16:15.344
No, but I mean, it's real.

16:15.364 --> 16:17.987
I mean, I can't read everything in check or something.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.511
But, so I do that.

16:20.831 --> 16:22.433
And then I look at the illustrations.

16:25.036 --> 16:31.765
The guy that wrote the book started it all, I assume.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.309
And then the guy that illustrated the book, he took a part, right?

16:35.649 --> 16:40.215
He took an active part and he made pictures or images.

16:40.448 --> 16:59.267
some sort now it's my turn to take the two parts that they took absorb that and make another part so that's what i do and sometimes it's i like that i kind of like

16:59.247 --> 17:04.934
to take a big part.

17:06.116 --> 17:10.601
What makes him one of the best?

17:10.621 --> 17:13.565
If not the best.

17:13.585 --> 17:20.073
This doesn't really work.

17:20.093 --> 17:21.074
Let me just make sure it is.

17:21.094 --> 17:21.595
It's working right along.

17:21.615 --> 17:28.343
I wrote someplace once, and I wish I could remember what the source of the float is.

17:29.622 --> 17:43.227
In describing the Liv d'Artiste, a book with original graphic art by a major artist, someone said the true definition was each page astonishes and delights.

17:44.607 --> 17:48.872
When you see one of Dawn's findings, it's always an astonishment and a delight.

17:49.432 --> 17:51.534
Same can be said about the binding, always.

17:52.576 --> 17:58.982
And it's always, oh, this is terrific.

17:59.002 --> 18:00.164
I wasn't expecting this.

18:00.244 --> 18:01.305
I never thought of this.

18:01.325 --> 18:02.987
It expands.

18:03.007 --> 18:05.589
He says he calls you and he asks you for ideas.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.552
No, he asks me what the book's about.

18:07.572 --> 18:13.618
But then it's this book that says... But then when you see it, you are astonished and delighted.

18:13.598 --> 18:25.474
Yes, because it's a way of looking at the book and thinking about the text and the art that's in it that I never thought about before, or that no one else would be able to think about before.

18:25.494 --> 18:33.605
In other words, what he has done is take the text and the art that's in it and interpret it and spun it through his mind.

18:33.625 --> 18:42.036
And what comes out is a form of communication, which our art is, but it's a different spin on it that...

18:42.016 --> 18:49.047
I hadn't thought of before, and it is always, and that spin is always the astonishment of the light.

18:49.447 --> 18:50.389
It's never boring.

18:50.409 --> 18:53.493
It's always adding to my understanding of what the book is.

18:53.593 --> 18:55.957
Okay, a couple of questions.

18:56.037 --> 19:01.666
Number one, is this in the franchise about the great book writing, number one?

19:01.686 --> 19:01.866
Yeah.

19:01.886 --> 19:03.428
Absolutely, yeah.

19:03.488 --> 19:06.673
What distinguishes this American book writing?

19:06.653 --> 19:13.103
This explosion of creativity we saw tonight was just celebrated in this show.

19:13.690 --> 19:36.270
I don't know, but I have to guess, I have to guess that... I want to know what... Yeah, I think that just the way the center of the art world changed from Paris to New York after the war, absolutely.

19:36.290 --> 19:37.352
Note that that...

19:37.332 --> 19:38.376
is for sure.

19:38.737 --> 19:41.969
After World War II, no one went to Paris to paint.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.198
Everyone went to New York.

19:44.639 --> 19:48.895
Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, David Hockney.

19:49.077 --> 20:00.649
And not just Americans, but people came to New York in the 50s the way they used to go to Paris in the 20s.

20:01.089 --> 20:14.022
And I think since the book world has always been called the tale of the dog in the outworld, that finally, you know,

20:14.002 --> 20:18.869
40 years later, 30 years later, the book world's finally catching up.

20:20.071 --> 20:26.299
But you need a lot of people doing it for a few people to really rise to the top.

20:26.359 --> 20:32.408
I mean, a lot of people have got to be out there doing it and exchanging ideas with one another and seeing each other's work.

20:33.289 --> 20:35.993
That might be why it's gotten better.

20:35.973 --> 20:57.188
in the last 10 years maybe it's really you know there's a what do you call it a quantum you know it feeds on itself quicker you know last year than it did in the first three years you know what i mean and it's because i mean i know for my for my own self

20:57.168 --> 21:08.750
Living where I live now, which is in Western Massachusetts, where there's a whole lot of people making books, finders, and printers, you know, that might be a story in itself.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.674
The Pioneer Valley certainly is.

21:10.774 --> 21:14.361
And look, what you've got there is an amazing concentration.

21:14.461 --> 21:17.387
I mean, you've got Leonard Baskin, who's 50 years old.

21:17.367 --> 21:21.014
He's been making books at this time.

21:21.094 --> 21:22.777
He's been printing.

21:22.797 --> 21:25.061
And when he started, Harold McGrath was printing.

21:25.963 --> 21:28.507
Harold's 80 years old?

21:28.527 --> 21:29.830
85 years old?

21:30.130 --> 21:32.254
No, I can't believe it.

21:32.454 --> 21:33.296
He is.

21:33.757 --> 21:38.806
Alan's having a big, I think he's been printing.

21:39.287 --> 21:41.130
He's 50 years printing.

21:41.110 --> 21:43.675
Oh, Leonard's printing.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.659
No, Harold's printing.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.040
Harold's printing?

21:46.120 --> 21:48.866
But he printed before that for Fritz Eichenberg and Furl.

21:48.906 --> 21:50.489
So it's not 80 years.

21:50.509 --> 21:54.718
No, not 80 years of printing, but isn't he 80 years old?

21:54.778 --> 21:55.800
I think he's 80.

21:56.461 --> 21:57.784
He's pretty well-deserved for 80 years old.

21:57.804 --> 22:00.790
Well, I think Alan told me he was, yeah.

22:00.770 --> 22:06.620
Because Al was having a birthday party for him.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.362
He's old, I'm telling you.

22:07.382 --> 22:11.249
But in any event, when Harold first started printing, there was no one else printing up there.

22:11.269 --> 22:15.456
I mean, there was no one else doing that sort of thing.

22:15.476 --> 22:19.343
What were you two kind of, because of this community out there?

22:19.443 --> 22:20.044
Pretty much.

22:20.024 --> 22:22.007
Yeah, I was in San Francisco.

22:22.788 --> 22:30.018
A lot of personal things happened.

22:30.038 --> 22:32.442
I mean, horses and all that stuff.

22:32.762 --> 22:34.184
I needed to get out of town.

22:34.284 --> 22:37.870
Yeah, but I needed to get out of town.

22:37.970 --> 22:42.336
I wanted to get out of town.

22:42.316 --> 22:49.102
But what happened was I... That wouldn't have been my first choice if I had that out of your shoes.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.063
You didn't go it that way.

22:50.083 --> 22:55.568
Well, what you do is you get in your car and you start driving until you get someplace.

22:56.188 --> 23:00.332
And I just, it wasn't that random, but I just, I took this big car track.

23:00.772 --> 23:05.036
And I did talks, and I talked at the Gloria's house one night.

23:05.536 --> 23:12.222
And this guy, David Bourbeau, in East Hampton, Massachusetts, was there and he said,

23:12.708 --> 23:17.521
Come on up if you're on the road and, you know, come on up.

23:17.602 --> 23:18.304
So I did.

23:18.344 --> 23:19.888
And he said, hey, this is all right.

23:19.908 --> 23:21.372
And he had this party for me.

23:21.473 --> 23:25.845
And he called, he called just people in East Hampton.

23:26.146 --> 23:26.747
East Hampton.

23:26.767 --> 23:27.730
Where did I know the area?

23:27.710 --> 23:31.857
Okay, he called the people just off the street, almost.

23:31.877 --> 23:35.442
And there was all these people I've heard of that were making books, right?

23:35.943 --> 23:44.537
Yeah, Grave Perot came, and Claudia Cohen, and Sarah Creighton, and all these people, and Carol Blinn, and, you know, one party.

23:44.517 --> 23:50.246
And it was like these guys were just going home from work, walking down the street, and there they were.

23:50.326 --> 24:06.171
I have to tell you, the first time I brought, the first time I brought Adrian to your house, I brought this very, very, very sophisticated European collection to Donham to dance for a potluck dinner about four years ago.

24:06.151 --> 24:08.354
And we pulled in from New York.

24:08.794 --> 24:11.318
We had lunch that day at John Flemington.

24:11.358 --> 24:12.700
Rosenbach's old place.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.425
And we drove up from New York and we pulled into Ashfield.

24:16.825 --> 24:18.107
And he got out of the car.

24:18.127 --> 24:19.949
It was an October evening.

24:20.470 --> 24:30.463
And he looked around and he said, this is the America one reads about that I never thought had existed.

24:30.583 --> 24:35.770
And we went in and there were all these people making books, all these artists.

24:35.750 --> 24:40.902
And he just looked around, and I said, this could be a story.

24:41.102 --> 24:45.372
And I said, now look, this isn't the Ritz, huh?

24:45.392 --> 24:49.060
And he said, this is wonderful.

24:49.381 --> 24:51.345
Right now, it's a really good story.

24:51.494 --> 24:59.706
It's a really Yankee, I mean, as opposed to French or English.

24:59.807 --> 25:02.531
It's a real American.

25:02.551 --> 25:04.494
It's a real American force.

25:04.514 --> 25:06.437
It's not French anymore or French anymore.

25:06.457 --> 25:08.900
It's like we went to those places.

25:08.920 --> 25:09.942
We learned what we could from it.

25:09.922 --> 25:12.867
The energy is here.

25:13.207 --> 25:17.254
Is it significant that this show was in Paris first?

25:18.235 --> 25:23.103
Only in that this was an exchange.

25:23.283 --> 25:35.322
The French bibliophile club sent over an exhibition to the Goliath Club in December of 87, an exhibition of contemporary French book findings.

25:35.302 --> 25:42.953
With the idea that three or four years later, the Americans would send over a reciprocal show.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.016
Not knowing what it is.

25:45.236 --> 25:47.940
Yes, but the formats of the catalog were the same.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.244
It's the same trim size, same format.

25:50.544 --> 25:59.537
It was an absolute direct exchange that was organized by the Grolier with the French equivalent of the Grolier.

25:59.517 --> 26:05.481
So that... Did theirs open in New York first and then go first?

26:05.501 --> 26:05.782
Yes, right.

26:05.802 --> 26:07.509
So it's just exactly the right.

26:07.610 --> 26:08.734
Just a flip.

26:09.187 --> 26:13.953
Only the brilliant, I have to say that it was probably Bob Nykirk that put it together.

26:14.414 --> 26:16.817
I mean, you know, the librarian or the girl who died.

26:16.837 --> 26:24.407
I have to suspect that it was Bob Poole who was the engineer in foot behind it.

26:24.427 --> 26:27.511
Bob was always interested in book arts, by the way.

26:27.531 --> 26:29.413
That was one of his stories.

26:29.634 --> 26:34.260
And he certainly liked American, and he certainly liked finding.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.444
Can I have another glass of water, please?

26:37.544 --> 26:37.624
Yes.

26:37.604 --> 26:48.441
I got it.

26:48.573 --> 26:54.041
It's an interesting story, isn't it?

26:54.061 --> 26:55.944
It hasn't been written yet.

26:55.964 --> 26:56.444
No, it hasn't.

26:56.464 --> 27:04.216
Everyone is so busy writing about the New York art scene, and all the New York artists, and Barbara Cooper, and Jane Schaubel.

27:04.236 --> 27:05.738
It's definitely a story.

27:06.339 --> 27:09.283
But I think it's the angle part.

27:09.303 --> 27:13.990
Yeah, and I don't know how to help you there.

27:13.970 --> 27:28.391
but I really get what I really have to feel is what this, and I, because I'm not, I don't know bindings, but, but if you were to take, how many, are they there, a hundred and six?

27:28.411 --> 27:30.274
A hundred and six.

27:30.354 --> 27:34.560
If you were to take these 106 bindings and put them next to 106 part bindings,

27:34.895 --> 27:38.224
Would you know immediately which was the American and which was the president?

27:38.245 --> 27:38.545
No question.

27:38.565 --> 27:38.706
Yeah.

27:38.726 --> 27:40.110
I could tell in one second.

27:40.230 --> 27:42.497
Don, you could, too.

27:42.517 --> 27:44.723
There's a little bit of crossover.

27:44.743 --> 27:46.167
There's a little bit of French-Canadian.

27:46.187 --> 27:46.368
Yeah.

27:46.428 --> 27:50.018
I heard people say, I asked that woman from Washington.

27:49.998 --> 28:13.204
I think the things that aren't, not all those books have it.

28:13.707 --> 28:30.417
I think that American bindings tend to be just bolder.

28:30.457 --> 28:32.020
They tend to be

28:32.320 --> 28:59.931
like kind of like america is you know it's kind of like brash and it might not be everybody's taste and it might be considered tasteless and there might be lots of things but it's like it's like i i feel like it's

29:00.097 --> 29:19.017
taken bigger steps than maybe were taken before.

29:18.997 --> 29:21.403
You're selling them, so we have to put this in there.

29:21.423 --> 29:22.966
Yeah, but somebody else is buying them.

29:22.986 --> 29:24.691
But someone else already bought the middle one.

29:24.711 --> 29:27.217
But I have to ask myself.

29:27.297 --> 29:28.881
I see it.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.224
I see it.

29:30.284 --> 29:30.805
It's a pearl.

29:31.146 --> 29:34.153
Steel, steel, silver, rising with a mirror.

29:34.387 --> 29:44.537
I don't know how to open a goddamn thing, and if I wanted to read this play, you know, this thing might poke me in a jar or hit me with a groin or something like that.

29:44.557 --> 29:48.081
You take it off, there's a case that it's what Sinsbury does.

29:48.101 --> 29:51.524
I'm being precise, but it's not just literature, though.

29:51.544 --> 29:52.445
That's the point.

29:52.465 --> 29:54.127
This is an impediment to it.

29:54.327 --> 29:58.651
No, this is adding to your enjoyment and understanding of the Beckett play.

29:58.931 --> 29:59.652
I think so.

29:59.672 --> 30:02.655
Yes, because the play takes place in a tin can.

30:02.973 --> 30:11.806
And the characters are struggling to get out of the silver tube that they live in, which is in fact a crash crash.

30:11.966 --> 30:15.792
So it's a pretty aggressive interpretation of the book, of the text.

30:15.932 --> 30:16.953
It's like America.

30:17.574 --> 30:20.559
It's a little more... So the body becomes a critic in a way.

30:20.579 --> 30:21.420
Indeed.

30:22.092 --> 30:26.682
He's putting his spin on the images that are in the book.

30:26.722 --> 30:28.225
What else can he be?

30:28.506 --> 30:30.510
What else could he do?

30:30.610 --> 30:35.561
A binder could be a binder and not a critic.

30:35.661 --> 30:37.024
I understand.

30:37.505 --> 30:41.333
But if he did that, then you'd have all the books looking alike.

30:41.954 --> 30:46.239
and they'd all be looking like Victorian bindings, that you could switch them, you wouldn't even know.

30:46.640 --> 30:57.493
None of them would relate, you know, they all look the same, they're all very elegant, very wonderful, but you wouldn't know if you're reading Wizard of Oz or, you know, Frankenstein's monster.

30:57.513 --> 31:07.945
So you think that the traditional bookcase is outmoded, it's an inequity, I mean, we take a book up itself, we have to have things, you know,

31:08.954 --> 31:09.975
Dangling things.

31:10.015 --> 31:11.116
No, they've got boxes.

31:11.377 --> 31:13.299
No, they've got boxes.

31:13.459 --> 31:17.323
You'd never know looking at the spines what was on the inside.

31:17.343 --> 31:17.544
Never.

31:17.564 --> 31:18.224
So they open up.

31:18.405 --> 31:18.925
Yeah.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.289
You know, you've got these amazing weird things that plopped around and everything.

31:22.569 --> 31:23.210
But they all fit.

31:23.230 --> 31:23.791
They all fit.

31:23.811 --> 31:29.037
And you put them in a box and they look just like your Gutenberg Bible right next to them.

31:29.057 --> 31:31.559
So the guy is an engineer as much as an artist.

31:31.579 --> 31:32.641
Oh, no question.

31:32.661 --> 31:33.882
Sometimes, yeah.

31:34.098 --> 31:37.122
Just to figure these foldings and stuff?

31:37.562 --> 31:37.802
Yeah, sure.

31:37.822 --> 31:39.004
It ain't easy, you know.

31:39.024 --> 31:44.150
Especially in some of the three-dimensional bindings that Don does.

31:44.190 --> 31:48.615
The one on his own book that... Look at that, three-dimensional bindings.

31:48.715 --> 31:50.397
Yes, the binding of sculpture.

31:50.417 --> 31:51.018
It's just a phrase.

31:51.078 --> 31:52.780
I mean, it's a very interesting phrase.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.944
But that was not invented in the United States.

31:56.024 --> 31:58.827
We have to give credit where credit is due.

31:58.847 --> 32:00.409
The French binder Paul Bonnet

32:00.710 --> 32:12.087
first did a sculpt a sculptural binding and they're called um a sculpte um and that was in the 50s and mostly he did them on bronx work interestingly interesting

32:12.269 --> 32:36.606
Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte Sculpte

32:36.586 --> 32:42.272
flat cubist work as three-dimensional, which, in fact, it was.

32:42.773 --> 32:51.342
But no one had ever said in another art form, look, this is what I see there, and this is what I'm doing.

32:51.362 --> 32:57.289
Also, though, the thing is that a binding is, if you don't do anything to it, it's a three-dimensional line.

32:57.449 --> 32:59.551
And it's a kinetic piece of sculpture.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.235
It pops around, you know, and opens and poses and pops up.

33:03.518 --> 33:05.680
You've got to handle it.

33:05.761 --> 33:15.211
Look, one of the most fascinating days I ever spent in my life was with Henry Moore at his place at his farm in England.

33:15.852 --> 33:18.495
And I got the grand tour.

33:18.535 --> 33:21.758
I was with some friends of his.

33:21.779 --> 33:22.820
And there were three of us.

33:22.940 --> 33:28.887
And we spent the whole day looking at all of his vines and all the sculptures, wet rubbers, and, you know, he was making everything.

33:28.967 --> 33:31.129
At the end of the day, we're back

33:31.109 --> 33:39.259
to his house to have tea with him, and he asked the three of us that were sitting there an astonishing question, I thought.

33:39.439 --> 33:46.347
He said, what is the one work of art, the one painting that you would live with for the rest of your life?

33:46.407 --> 33:48.970
If you could only have one, what is the one that you would have?

33:49.351 --> 33:57.420
Now, I was with a French art dealer who said, who deals in impressions paintings, and he said, probably a Derek Boots or some other French painter, which absolutely, yes.

33:57.400 --> 34:03.169
It astonished me because I thought I knew the man, and I thought that he would say Manet, you know.

34:03.189 --> 34:05.973
But he said Derek Boots is another Spanish painting.

34:06.073 --> 34:14.886
Another contemporary dealer, who was a good friend of his, actually named...

34:14.866 --> 34:19.476
I think an English painter, as I recall, from maybe Gainsborough.

34:19.497 --> 34:22.423
And I said, Goya, I happen to love Goya.

34:22.543 --> 34:26.132
But my next question was, who cares what we think?

34:26.172 --> 34:29.820
What's the one picture that you would want?

34:30.290 --> 34:50.391
said well he said it was it's the one painting that's like a sculpture and we all looked at one another and said yes you want to explain that and he said well i'll show you and he came out with a little 12 inch by 12 inch square of uh about

34:50.371 --> 34:58.180
or four inches high, a maquette of the Cezanne bathers, but interpreted as a piece of sculpture.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.786
And he said Cezanne was, in fact, a sculptor.

35:02.806 --> 35:04.648
He just sculpted on canvas.

35:05.489 --> 35:12.377
And he had the sculpture to prove that, in fact... Cezanne made it?

35:12.477 --> 35:13.639
No, he made it.

35:13.659 --> 35:19.045
But it was his interpretation of the Cezanne... So what do you think is one of his old things?

35:19.379 --> 35:26.833
No, he wanted the Suzanne Babis because he always thought of it as a piece of sculpture rather than as a painting.

35:27.053 --> 35:35.890
Well, that's in a way, this is a convoluted saying, that's what a binder does.

35:36.351 --> 35:42.923
He looks at and thinks about what's in the book and

35:43.240 --> 35:50.550
and translates it into his own medium, which is what Henry Moore did.

35:50.570 --> 35:59.923
He translated, or transliterated, I guess, I don't know, translated the Cezanne Bader's into a piece of sculpture, and that's what a binder does.

36:00.604 --> 36:04.249
Then, of course, it's talent.

36:04.570 --> 36:07.594
I mean, at that point, you can have all the translation in the world.

36:07.614 --> 36:08.635
And it don't work.

36:08.876 --> 36:09.957
But you have to have them.

36:09.937 --> 36:10.958
Yeah, the skill.

36:10.978 --> 36:16.806
I might have a feeling in the world for this particular text.

36:16.946 --> 36:19.949
My daughter, my eight-year-old, draws better than I do.

36:21.171 --> 36:23.053
I draw like I'm fine.

36:23.073 --> 36:25.056
But my point is she takes lessons.

36:25.416 --> 36:32.485
What I'm trying to say is however profoundly you feel about something, you still have to have skills and

36:32.735 --> 36:38.481
I think that's why people still go to Europe to study.

36:38.501 --> 36:45.127
Because there's an aesthetic skill that I'm not talking about.

36:45.387 --> 36:49.572
But how to put, I mean, the craft.

36:50.212 --> 36:51.694
I've got a question.

36:51.714 --> 36:53.395
The craft is best.

36:53.475 --> 36:55.658
How much is craft and how much is art?

36:55.698 --> 36:57.619
That's what I'd like to say.

36:57.639 --> 37:01.223
How much of binding is craft and how much is art?

37:01.203 --> 37:11.422
Depends on who the binder is.

37:11.482 --> 37:24.426
To me, because I really love what I learned in France, which was really amazing craftsmanship.

37:24.558 --> 37:33.728
I learned to appreciate it, and I learned to, maybe I can, when I'm 90, achieve that kind of craftsmanship.

37:33.828 --> 37:44.861
I think that for my books, if they're not crafted as good as I can get, I mean, just good, then I'm not happy at all.

37:44.921 --> 37:50.667
So the craft is very important, but I mean, it's really, really important.

37:51.811 --> 38:19.675
and maybe nobody even knows that that sees the stuff you know because half the stuff that i make half the craft is all covered up with all kinds of other stuff what i'm saying is the art can be exquisite yeah well then it sucks there's a lot that comes out that's right that's right that's right that is true it's a really you know it's not like it's not like you know

38:20.110 --> 38:23.914
Jackson Pollock is slapping stuff all over the place.

38:24.374 --> 38:33.042
And, you know, now, everyone, 40 years later, you know, pops off, or some of the Roushenberg stuff is popping off and stuff.

38:34.304 --> 38:37.106
That's where the book-binding tradition, I think, comes in.

38:37.126 --> 38:39.809
Like, there's craftsmanship, and it really counts.

38:40.229 --> 38:43.793
And it's not good enough to have stuff popping off 50 years later.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.334
I would think so.

38:45.354 --> 38:49.138
Well, it's not the money of the thing, but...

38:49.422 --> 38:58.900
But you expect a standard of excellence, which erases... Yeah, so that isn't good enough to have it falling apart.

38:59.141 --> 39:00.403
To me, I mean, to me.

39:00.423 --> 39:01.606
Well, I would think so.

39:01.626 --> 39:06.936
You have to understand that the French book finders never found their own books.

39:06.956 --> 39:09.000
Paul Bonnet was a designer, wasn't he?

39:08.980 --> 39:12.925
Someone else executed them, and someone else did the gilding.

39:12.945 --> 39:17.931
Don not only designed the findings, but he executes them and does the gilding.

39:17.951 --> 39:19.553
It's a major change.

39:19.653 --> 39:21.796
It's a major, major change.

39:21.836 --> 39:30.567
What makes Ansel Adams a great photographer is that his hands are covered with acid, because he did the prints.

39:30.800 --> 39:37.491
That's a real American thing too.

39:37.551 --> 39:56.824
It's not necessarily a real American thing, but it's a real non-French thing.

39:57.597 --> 40:05.285
The sort of French tradition is that lots of people make one book.

40:05.966 --> 40:14.335
There's a guy that sews it, a guy that hears it out of it, a guy that designs it, and there's a guy that does all those decorative stuff.

40:14.375 --> 40:18.199
So it is a craft, a work of craftsmanship at every step of the way.

40:18.740 --> 40:19.300
Yeah.

40:19.340 --> 40:22.744
Because everybody's doing a different...

40:23.146 --> 40:34.219
the guy that he felt was the best guy to produce the binding part of the book.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.240
So he was called a binder.

40:35.300 --> 40:39.525
The binder would have these subs that he would hire out.

40:39.866 --> 40:42.108
A sewer, who was always a woman.

40:42.188 --> 40:46.634
And it's true.

40:47.314 --> 40:52.140
So the book would get sewn outside the shop, come back to the guy's shop,

40:52.593 --> 41:04.106
He would put the covers on it and, you know, do the leather business, figure out what, you know, get the skin, send the skin out to be thin to the right thickness, get the skin back.

41:04.286 --> 41:05.828
He wouldn't do it himself.

41:05.848 --> 41:07.690
And he'd put the, you know, cover the book.

41:10.113 --> 41:16.440
The headbands and the little thing, the woven stuff up here, that would be done by the woman that did the first sewing.

41:16.775 --> 41:19.139
And all that gets done.

41:19.239 --> 41:22.744
And then now you've got this little book that's got no title on it.

41:22.764 --> 41:24.387
It's got no decoration on it.

41:24.407 --> 41:26.771
It's got no sand, no nothing on it.

41:26.791 --> 41:29.435
And now that guy's done.

41:29.455 --> 41:30.997
He's got his job done.

41:31.598 --> 41:34.042
So he now gives it back to Bonnet.

41:34.062 --> 41:35.424
I'm not sure who gets it to it.

41:35.444 --> 41:39.431
But then the gilder gets it, the guy that does all the gold tooling and stuff.

41:40.192 --> 41:43.457
And he takes the drawing that Bonnet has made.

41:43.758 --> 41:49.365
And he translates that into gold lines and colored lines and different colored leathers and all those things.

41:49.745 --> 41:51.027
And then he does all that stuff.

41:52.088 --> 41:54.832
And then he finally gives it a bonnet.

41:55.753 --> 41:57.695
And bonnet stamps the signature on it.

41:58.056 --> 42:00.499
And it's a bonnet vinyl.

42:00.519 --> 42:02.081
And that's the truth.

42:02.161 --> 42:03.322
Because he designed it.

42:03.342 --> 42:08.869
And the other two guys, forget about the woman who sewed it and the guy that killed the leather and all that.

42:08.889 --> 42:09.891
Oh, they get paid, right?

42:09.911 --> 42:11.072
They get paid, right.

42:11.092 --> 42:12.634
But the binder...

42:13.525 --> 42:16.790
The binder slash contractor and the gilder.

42:17.110 --> 42:19.214
So it's just been subbed out every step of the way.

42:19.234 --> 42:19.634
Yeah.

42:19.654 --> 42:23.780
They might get a little initial on the back, possibly.

42:23.901 --> 42:25.143
No, they didn't.

42:25.663 --> 42:28.027
The only one that ever gave credit was Rose Adler.

42:28.047 --> 42:28.788
Rose Adler did, yeah.

42:28.808 --> 42:30.831
But that's because she did the binding herself.

42:30.851 --> 42:31.232
That's right.

42:31.252 --> 42:34.397
They say worsted the insect with bindings ever since all that.

42:35.138 --> 42:35.759
What does that mean?

42:36.179 --> 42:36.740
Little bindings.

42:37.641 --> 42:38.723
Kitsch to the max.

42:39.462 --> 42:42.387
But how come they spent so much money for him?

42:42.407 --> 42:46.414
No one ever went broke, underestimating the taste of the American public.

42:46.434 --> 42:49.319
So, do you think Chagrin A. was a speculator?

42:50.340 --> 42:53.566
No, I think he probably really liked him.

42:53.586 --> 42:54.768
What did he tell him?

42:54.788 --> 42:56.070
Was he young man?

42:56.337 --> 42:58.523
This is not for the record.

42:58.543 --> 42:59.025
Yeah, I don't know.

42:59.045 --> 43:00.328
I don't know him, so I don't know.

43:00.348 --> 43:01.050
I've talked to him.

43:01.070 --> 43:02.334
He's a pretty nice guy.

43:02.354 --> 43:03.377
I have no idea.

43:04.359 --> 43:08.551
He was rather amazed that I asked him to sign the catalog.

43:08.571 --> 43:09.634
He said, oh, we've asked for that.

43:10.116 --> 43:10.677
There you go.

43:10.697 --> 43:11.078
Oh, you know what?

43:11.098 --> 43:11.359
This guy...

43:11.339 --> 43:21.956
Well, you know, a lot of people want to be the executives of their own estates, too.

43:21.976 --> 43:23.659
Yeah, but he wanted the monument now.

43:23.859 --> 43:26.764
He wanted the monument now so he could live with it and love it.

43:26.964 --> 43:29.228
A lot of people want the approbation.

43:29.248 --> 43:31.692
Look, this is the one thing that has happened.

43:31.712 --> 43:36.039
This is the change in the art world that no one seems to have gotten a handle on.

43:36.059 --> 43:38.663
It makes me crazy.

43:38.643 --> 43:49.698
You know, no one seems to get it, and the vulgarity of the art world is wonderful and appalling at the same time.

43:49.718 --> 44:06.540
What has happened is, in the past, in the 19th century, in the 18th century, those people that were patrons of the art, in quotes, whatever that means, you know, you bought a book, you bought a painting, you bought a piece of art,

44:13.962 --> 44:22.193
I was telling people that knew we were equals in your same social class, and they had the same stuff.

44:22.314 --> 44:24.382
You didn't have it to impress anyone else.

44:24.402 --> 44:25.305
You just had it.

44:26.905 --> 44:31.913
Since World War I, since the 20th century, things have changed.

44:31.933 --> 44:39.685
People have art now to move up in the world socially, to flaunt their wealth, to show what they've got.

44:39.705 --> 44:41.869
And it has not changed.

44:42.370 --> 44:43.211
It's not going to change.

44:43.231 --> 44:50.723
I mean, it's going to keep going like that because, I don't know, Charles Ryskamp said art was a new religion that on Sunday no one went to church anymore.

44:50.743 --> 44:52.666
Everyone went to the museums.

44:52.686 --> 44:53.908
And it's quite true.

44:53.888 --> 44:56.832
Art is the new religion.

44:56.852 --> 45:04.442
But it's got no, but the morals and ethics of art aren't for the people who collect it, they're for the people who create it.

45:06.445 --> 45:11.051
And that's where our society could have run into deep yet.

45:14.836 --> 45:16.719
That's where maybe the religion comes in.

45:16.819 --> 45:21.465
I mean, you know, the people that make this stuff,

45:21.445 --> 45:24.610
They do have to have morals and ethics.

45:24.630 --> 45:26.433
They're not going to create good stuff.

45:27.174 --> 45:30.420
Yeah, I mean, you've got to believe in this stuff.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.964
Right, but for the collectors, it doesn't apply to them.

45:32.984 --> 45:36.490
They don't got it, and they don't have to have it to buy it.

45:36.550 --> 45:46.366
I mean, I don't know if Julian Schnabel is a pretty artist, but people think hundreds of thousands of dollars for his work to say, come on over for dinner on Friday.

45:46.386 --> 45:46.947
Oh, if you happen to

45:46.927 --> 45:57.121
I don't even notice my new schnauble over the dining room table.

45:57.141 --> 45:59.144
I mean, it's a... I hope you notice.

45:59.484 --> 46:02.929
You know, and does that mean, you know, does it mean... I mean, it's an astounding thing.

46:03.189 --> 46:04.431
It's like wearing Gucci loafers and carrying a Vuitton hammer.

46:04.451 --> 46:05.212
It's the same sort of thing.

46:05.232 --> 46:09.778
We live now in this absolutely modern society where there's no small pounds, no...

46:09.758 --> 46:12.622
structure to our society.

46:12.642 --> 46:22.196
The only thing that imparts value or gives structure are things like art and Vuitton bags and Gucci's.

46:22.216 --> 46:23.678
Recognizable wealth.

46:24.119 --> 46:29.927
Recognizable status and show you belong, that show that you're part of a group.

46:29.907 --> 46:33.252
It's amazing.

46:33.272 --> 46:45.491
But like I said, the problem is, if it's the new religion, the problem is that the morals of the new religion only apply to the creators, not to those of them.

46:45.592 --> 46:51.561
So I don't know where it's going to take us in the long run, but I certainly do know that we can all

46:51.693 --> 46:57.503
We can all keep not pandering to the new religion.

46:57.704 --> 47:02.412
I mean, it's... I don't know.

47:02.432 --> 47:04.856
I mean, why do I deal with this stuff?

47:04.956 --> 47:09.925
I have absolutely no creative talent whatsoever.

47:09.945 --> 47:10.967
But I love...

47:10.947 --> 47:14.452
Looking at it.

47:14.893 --> 47:19.620
And I love the intellectual challenge of it.

47:19.640 --> 47:20.682
Did John deal with this stuff?

47:20.742 --> 47:24.607
Never.

47:24.628 --> 47:24.748
Never.

47:25.108 --> 47:25.509
You know what?

47:25.529 --> 47:28.133
I've got to get up at 5 a.m., folks.

47:29.595 --> 47:29.695
Okay.

47:29.715 --> 47:32.640
I've got funniest stuff for the moment.

47:32.660 --> 47:34.963
Where are you going back, Priscilla?

47:35.433 --> 47:38.318
Tell me what you think.

47:38.559 --> 47:52.024
I think that when there's enough energy and enough people believing in the energy that they're doing, when there's enough of that, you can't ignore it.

47:52.696 --> 47:54.219
The French can't ignore it.

47:54.239 --> 48:01.311
They look around, they look across the ocean and say, and they see these books and they don't understand them because they're not like what they make.

48:02.253 --> 48:03.735
And they say, what the hell?

48:03.756 --> 48:05.479
I mean, they gotta, they can't ignore it.

48:06.601 --> 48:09.946
And I think that they, I don't know.

48:09.987 --> 48:11.970
They'll probably, they're French.

48:12.575 --> 48:14.418
I mean, they think everything they do is good.

48:14.438 --> 48:15.119
Yeah, yeah.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.442
It's not that they think that this is not good.

48:17.763 --> 48:20.607
Somebody caught up with a lover in Paris.

48:20.707 --> 48:22.490
Oh, yeah.

48:22.510 --> 48:28.800
Yeah, I mean, these guys don't do this right, they don't do that right, but they probably... They probably screws them up.

48:29.901 --> 48:32.305
What the hell are they doing over there?

48:32.325 --> 48:33.587
Look, I...

48:34.107 --> 48:37.333
Among the big buyers, what do they think?

48:37.373 --> 48:41.020
Well, I sell American findings to European collectors.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.302
And what do they think?

48:42.402 --> 48:47.632
Well, obviously they like them because they're happy to buy them.

48:47.712 --> 48:51.699
Yeah, but they probably buy French findings too.

48:51.819 --> 48:54.204
Yes, but they also buy American.

48:54.224 --> 48:55.426
Well, that's good.

48:55.446 --> 48:58.191
We can explore that.
